This is too close to your previous moves near F3. One place to the
right at L3 is better. If you want to play K3, then make the solid
connection at F4. In this position, it would be interesting to connect
at F4 and then extend to K4. After that you can either play O3 and
make a nice position on the bottom, or make a shimari on the top at
E17.];W[ed];B[jd]C[
I would pincer closer, perhaps H17. The purpose of the pincer is take
away white's base but a move this far away doesn't do that very well.
After H17, if white attaches at C17, you play the same joseki, but
white doesn't get the nice extension to H17. He will have to run. You
just want to live on the side, and then make a moyo on the top using
your extension/pincer.];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[hc];B[df]C[
I prefer K17. The left side is not a good place to play for either
side because of the stone at C6. There just isn't much territory to be
gained on the left side for either of you.  The C16 stones can't be
killed, and K17 starts a moyo on the top right.];W[qf];B[qd]C[
This seems passive. I would probably jump to O17 and make a moyo on
the top. Had you played K17 last move, you could pincer at R12 and
make profit on the top. Now, though, the top is open at the bottom
because of H17.];W[nc];B[oc]C[
Much too defensive.  You are strong here so you can easily fight. Play
to separate the two white stones. When White has two weak groups, you
can make territory while attacking them.];W[nd];B[oe]C[
Good, but one move too late. The P17, O16 exchange is good for white
because O16 make white stronger, but P17 doesn't do much for you. This
shape (P17,Q16,P15) isn' good. Later white may be able to separate
your stones.];W[kc];B[jc];W[qi];B[kd];W[lc];B[jb];W[od];B[ob];W[ne]C[White can cut at Q15.]
;B[pf];W[of];B[pe];W[og];B[pg];W[qg];B[ck]C[
I would continue the attack in the upper right. White has a lot of
weaknesses there. Just push to Q12. What can white do? If he connects
at R12, you can cut at O14 and make two weak groups, an if he protects
the cut, the stones on the right are in trouble when you push through
and cut. In any case C9 is small. O3 is bigger if you just want to
take territory. White must respond. C9 is gote.];W[hf];B[qn]C[
Your stones around K18 are getting weak. Protecting them is probably
urgent now. Jumping out to L13 is probably forcing because of the cut at
O14. Then you can play R6 if you want to.];W[qo];B[pn];W[np];B[pk]C[
This should probably be at R9. you need to make a base on the side.];W[oi]
C[Why not Q12?];B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[mg];B[qh]C[
pushing through on the other side is bigger. Keep the two groups separate.]

Good. Now your stones are connected. You just have to worry about Q6 now.]

This is probably not good. The K18 stones still aren't alive. I would
probably try F17 instead. You can either connect underneat at H18,
making a second eye or cut off some white stones. Either way, you
wont hurt the K18 stones.];W[he];B[gd];W[gc];B[ee];W[hd];B[gf];W[hg];B[gg]

Black is making territory on the left, but the K18 stones are getting weaker.]

Ooops. You need to connect at L1 to make 1 eye. You should be able to
make a second eye at the top, or connect to the outside. Later you may
have to fight the KO at H12. Right now the game is very close.
Although white seems to have a slight advantage, black isn't out of it yet.
Losing the M11 stones is too big to recover from.];W[ki];B[hk];W[fd];B[lk]
