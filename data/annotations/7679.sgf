C[Hi. This is a game from dgs, I play white. There seem to be some big problems right after the fuseki (or perhaps in the fuseki itself?), but still about at move 90 it was close ... so my biggest question might be when and how to start yose. Thank you in advance!

Remi :
Hi,
This game was quite difficult to comment, since it is quite clear you had a lot of time to think about your moves, and made few reading mistakes. However, your ideas (both black's and white's) are really strange sometimes :) Overall, you think too much in terms of territory, and not enough in terms of groups. I recommend reading Attack & Defense (Ishi Press) or Get Strong at Attacking. Personnally I prefer the 1st one. The second one is a book of problems.

I am sorry I didn't answer to your question about yose, since I don't feel really competent at it. You'll probably learn more about yose by reading books.

Next time you send a review, please add more comments. It makes it easier to understand your weaknesses.

C[Is this a good response by black?

Remi :
This response is slow and heavy when black doesn't have an extension on the side yet. These 2 stones don't have eyes yet, so your idea of playing around F17 is correct. I think I'd play E17 instead, because F17 doesn't put enough pressure on the 2 stones.]
;W[fc];B[hc]LB[hd:B][fe:A]C[Remi : 
Although A seems like a reasonable plan, let me suggest B, that aims at reinforcing yourself before you can attack the lone 2 stones. It may not work very well, but at least you get the idea of how to punish black from having these 2 weak stones.]
(;W[fe]LB[cb:A][df:B]C[black A is so passive !
B is probably better]
(;B[cb];W[ef]C[Remi : I think white is happy.];B[kd];W[dj]LB[qk:B]
[dm:C][ep:A]TR[cf][ef]C[Remi : this one may be a little slow. The triangled stones look solid, so extending doesn't look urgent. A, B, or C look playable]
;B[iq]LB[gq:A]C[Remi : Here I'd play A to make a nice moyo]
(;W[qk];B[eq];W[dn]TR[fe][ef]C[Now your strength looks difficult to use]
;B[lq];W[po];B[qh]LB[oe:A][gq:B]C[Remi : Here I think I would consider 2 possibilities:
- either try to reduce black by playing A, trying to prevent black P12, that would be very big (I show some continuations)
- or wait and see by playing B, to separate E3 from J3, andtry to start a favorable fight, given the strength you have around

white has to know he can also invade the corner in gote at S16]
(;W[md]TR[hc][kd]SQ[le][me][mf][nf][of][og][pg]C[This seems to be a very problematic move ... what is better in this situation?

Remi :
Black is pretty thick in the area so an invasion has to be difficult. What I like with this invasion is that you try to make the triangled stones weak, which is good if you need to use your F15 stones. What I don't like with your move is that black has the option of connecting everything easily at N17, thus making your invasion completely meaningless.

With this move, you didn't weaken black's position, and didn't really reduce w's territory. 

So... When to invade ?
0. Invade if you wouldn't win by simply building your own territory
1. Invade to create weak groups for your opponent
2. Invade when it's really big (more than 30 points in the area you're invading). Otherwise, just reduce.

And... How to invade ?
1. Invade on the 3rd line. That is where you'll find life
2. look for a move that has multiple exits : ideally you want to be able to escape to the center, or to 2 different sides.
3. Invade near the opponent weaknesses, and far from its strengths

How to reduce ?
Try to draw a straight line marking the limit of the moyo (the squared line). Deeper than this line is usually too deep.]
(;B[kf]C[probably possible, but more complicated];W[le]C[Remi :I think it's a bad kikashi. Doesn't really help you, and strengthens black. There are manyother ways to use the "weakness" of the tobi, like sliding at L17, or some later forcing moves aroun L14]
;B[ke];W[mg];B[pi]LB[kh:B][mi:A]C[This move looks slow. I don't see what it threatens. White has to get out at A. See how B dominates the board. It is a pity black can connect at N17, because now you can't use your invasion to attack anything.]
;W[ok]C[This move doesn't look very wise. You drive black towards your weak group]
(;B[ni];W[lh];B[jg]C[this move looks really slow. At least, for the same idea, b should play K12
If black wants to save his group, he can just play at N17.]
(;W[pf]LB[ne:B][qf:A]C[This move doesn't look very good. b can just connect at R14 (most simple), or try to capture your stone at O15, to prevent white from making eyes]
(;B[mj];W[oh];B[oi];W[jh];B[qf];W[kj];B[pm]
(;W[om]C[This answer was probably wrong ... is R7 the best one?

Remi : The whole sequence is really weird ! R7 might be a good move, but not the way you played it. To make it simple,  you don't want to attach stones you want to attack, so unless you have a specific plan, like making the stone heavy before you attack it, don't attach. 

I have shown a sequence where you connect your stones simply.

You can think about it that way : 
b is cutting your groups. So there are 2 choices :
- either you connect your stones, and accept that black gets something in compensation
- or you try to attack black and gain something out of it. Personnally, I don't see any good way to attack the black stone, so I'd simply play R7 and connect my stones.]
;B[pl]
(;W[ol]C[Remi :
Huge mistake.

I wonder what you had in mind when you connected those 2 stones together. Do you have a plan to use these stones ? Now black takes easy territory, has no weaknesses, and leaves you with a cutting point...]
;B[pk];W[pn]LB[on:A]C[Although not directly cuttable, there is a cut.]
;B[qm]C[nice empty triangle. The shape for black is S8.

By the way, that is just yose.]
(;W[qn]C[Nice empty triangle here as well. Note that S6 instead threatened as much as R6 does.]
;B[rm];W[gq]C[good idea

b can connect his stones at G2 or try harder at C3]
(;B[cr]LB[fp:D][gp:C][hp:B][ir:A]C[Here, white should try to prevent the connection underneath and attack one of black's groups very severely. A is an idea, but B, C, or D, could be just as good.]
(;W[dq]C[bad idea. Now you lose all the benefit of an invasion at G3, I think]
