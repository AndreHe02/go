;W[ro];B[rr];W[qk]C[My friend says no one played this joseki anymore, is it true?
Why?



Because ppl think one side is better in the joseki?
I do not think that's a lot of difference.];B[de];W[ce];B[cf]
;W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj];W[cm];B[qi]LB[qh:a][qg:b]C[down side white is strong, this move is too close to it.]
;W[jd];B[lc];W[ke];B[hd]LB[oi:a][oe:b][pg:c]C[I think this move is too slow since white is light and right
side is bigger than this open area.

Yes you are right.];W[qg];B[ph];W[qe];B[rd];W[of];B[me]C[My sense tell me that if I let white connect, 31 will go to waste
and two stones on the right will be very meaningless.


yes];W[ng];B[ni];W[pd];B[pc];W[nd];B[le];W[lh];B[kf];W[mj];B[pk]
;W[qj];B[pj]C[this move isn't neccessary, white may kill me, right?



I cannot see what's wrong with this move.]

C[should I cut now? Maybe extend on the lower side first and wait
for opportunity?


I'll cut, too. I feel these fight is bigger than downside. And there is a high chance that you can get sente after attacks and then extend on the lower side.]

Still, I think there're chance the white group can die.

right];B[dk];W[cl];B[ej];W[fk];B[en]C[I don't know how to play other than this.]
