C[Hi reviewer



This is a short game because of time control,



but i am very interested in your advice :)

Comment: Andre Bergholz, 2K in Germany, berge on IGS, NNGS (Comments marked with AB)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[cp];B[cf]LB[fd:A][df:C][cj:B]C[looks odd, since theres a komoku to approach ...  anyhow, between a, b or c I made my choice:

dunno how to exploit/treat 'b'

'a' looks slow, soft

and I like 'c'

AB: For Black, I would also prefer a kakari at E3 or E4. For White, however, I like 'C' the least. 'A' is quite normal and not bad or slow. A pincer attack at 'B' I like best, because it works well if you manage to get the shimari at E3. The joseki starting with 'C' strengthens both sides, but Black welcomes this help.]

(;W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[ce];W[cd];B[eg]C[woa! this isn't the joseki ...  should I even follow it  ?

AB: Now that's a funny question. You seem to be a perfect candidate for somehow who gets two stones weaker when studying joseki. Obviously you cannot ignore this move even if you think it is not joseki. It is quite frequently played. Permitting Black to hane at F14 would be the end of the game from a certain strength level on. Besides, even non-joseki moves are often only one or two points worse than joseki moves. You should not study joseki anymore and concentrate on shape and middle-game techniques.]
;W[ff];B[fg];W[gc]LB[fd:A][gg:B]C[looks like a connection too but further than in the joseki,

so ... do I gain someting ?

AB: This move looks strange, I would have prefered the "normal" move F16 ('A') or, if you want to play more actively, hane at G13 ('B'). Black cannot cut as long as C13 is not protected.]
;B[dk]LB[cl:A]C['A' looks more interesting to me. Overall, this variation is not bad for Black, because White did not choose a good joseki.]
;W[eq]C[I'm happy,

was waiting for that so that I can play my shimari.

AB: Yes, very good. The biggest point on the board.];B[gf]LB[pj:A]
C[:( ... is it so bad for me ?

I really dunno how to answer -> looking the whole board to guess a move.

AB: This is a big point for Black, however a san-ren-sei at 'A' looks even bigger to me. I included a random sequence for Black after the next move whose purpose is to demontrate how the top side can be severly effected by the Black move at G14. Besides, your protection move at G14 now looks not so great shapewise. There is a reason why F16 is good :-).]
;W[nc]
(;B[pf];W[jd]LB[lc:A][gd:B][fd:C]C[what about the sequence ?

AB: The sequence is reasonable but beware that the top side is by no means White territory. Black has still many opportunities there, 'A' is obvious, but 'B' or 'C' look even more severe.]

(;B[oc]C[AB: Bad move for Black. Only helps White...];W[nd]
C[what about this exchange ?  joseki ?

better for white (strenghenned)?

for black (more territory )?

AB: Better for White. The distance to K16 is now ideal. The invasion at M17 is no real threat anymore. Furthermore, Black gains little, because White can still invade at 3-3.]
;B[ph]C[AB: Again, not so good. Too narrow. Q10 is much better.]
;W[pn]C[AB: Wrong direction. O3 is good. White puts an unnecessary burden on himself.]
;B[np];W[jp]C[AB: Now all of a sudden the bottom side is more interesting. Typical case of the "I want everything"-disease.]

(;B[gq]LB[pl:A]C[AB: Ha, terrible! Both of you are not willing to give the opponent anything. This move is the worst in the whole game. Black has an excellent opportunity (attack the lone White Q6 stone at 'A') but instead choses to put another weak stone on the board, which will be a burden later on.]
;W[lq]LB[qj:A]TR[pn]C[AB: I think helping the other stone with 'A' is better.]
;B[qo];W[dm]C[Or the lower right sansan was better ?

here, I wanted to threaten black while gaining some territory

AB: The lower right 3-3 would be another instant of the "I want everything"-disease. If you play 3-3 Black will play Q8 and take the whole of the right-hand side, which is much bigger.
Your move is not bad, but beware that it is relatively easy for Black to handle the G3 stone and the upper group is 100% safe.]
;B[go]C[AB: Maybe a more flexible approach (D5?) would be better here for Black.]
;W[jn];B[gm];W[pk];B[qn]C[AB: Very big.];W[qm];B[qq]C[... hum

how to exploit black weakness with this 3stones group in a row ?

However, I find myself not strong enoug,

so I decide to strengten that .

Bad idea ?];W[jl]C[AB: Your move is not bad. Forget about attacking for the moment, you have a lot of problems yourself (on the right).]
;B[el]C[AB: The shape is not ideal, G9 seems better to me.]
;W[nr]LB[nm:A]C[AB: Good, an alternative is O7 ('A').]
(;B[pr]C[AB: Way too small. Black is in no danger. Time to attack, otherwise Black falls behind.]
;W[qi]LB[nm:A]C[AB: Not really a good exchange for White. Simply 'A' is good. Black has not enough territory.]
;B[qh]C[richard [10k\]: your time];W[nk];B[do]C[ok, there was a weak point here,

should I have protected it before ?

how ?

AB: No, you had no time to protect earlier (F5 would be the point, I think). It looks to me, tough, you could have done a little better by answering at C5 (see variation).]

(;W[dp];B[dn];W[bn];B[cm]C[looks like I lost because of time.

Any how, I'll read your comments with interest ,  thanks.

AB: White should use sente to protect the upper side. Then he has the advantage, because R17 is still open. My advice is to think more about the right joseki instead of wondering about correct moves in a joseki. Also, think about direction, which areas are important, and don't invade too early. If you have any more questions you can reach me by email: Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com]

C[AB: Black already has secured a lot of territory on the right. Now he can either destroy the bottom or severly threaten the life of the White group thereby creating more territory in the center of the board.]
