C[TsuQ: This is your reviewer TsuQ, I'll take a look at your game and see what I can see =\]  This is how I will enter comments.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[jd];W[jp];B[oq]
(;W[fj]C[TsuQ: This is very high. It's no trouble for black to make terrotory underneath this, after which the stone looks a bit misplaced]

(;B[fc]C[TsuQ: This kind of encourages white to make the F10 stone work, although it might be hard.]

(;W[eb]C[TsuQ: This kind of move is especially useful to prevent black from extending toward the corner and making eyespace, but the stone isn't in much trouble.]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[fb]
(;W[ea];B[fa];W[db]SQ[dd][fj]C[TsuQ: There is some weakness here because of how high the stones are, not a lot of territory has been claimed yet.]
;B[pj]C[TsuQ: Fine move, very big.];W[cn]C[TsuQ: I like this, it closes off corner territory and starts to limit black's options on the left side.]

(;B[jj]SQ[jd][pd][pj]C[TsuQ: This is fine in that it's a big moyo move which works with the other three star point stones. You may be losing a chance to invade white's territory though...]
;W[fg]C[TsuQ: Very high, but it does make it harder for a black invasion...]
;B[kq]C[TsuQ: I like this idea in a sense, because white is high and you are low, you can make territory while threatening whites - just remember the higher stones should be making more territory if they succeed. I think invading is bigger here if it works...]
;W[jq];B[kr];W[jr]
(;B[jn]C[TsuQ: i dont like this... the bottom is still open so you aren't making a lot of territory with this, and a reduction belongs between the stones at the front of the opponents territory (usually).]

(;W[hn]SQ[jp]C[TsuQ: This relationship between stones (diagonal jump) is bad if black has the time to split it...]

(;B[hj]C[TsuQ: For territory protecting the corner is bigger. Right now, it might be a good idea to make the bottom right safe also...]
;W[gl]C[TsuQ: Now its obvious blacks move just helped make this giant corner here more secure...]
;B[ko]C[TsuQ: This is troublesome because...]
(;W[jo];B[kn];W[ih]C[TsuQ: At some point the 3-3 invasion should be played or protected.]

(;B[jh]C[TsuQ:  this connection is weak because...]
(;W[gq];B[ii];W[hh];B[if];W[ik]
(;B[ij];W[gg]C[TsuQ: Even if this is needed to save the two stones, the invasion is much bigger.]
;B[jl]C[TsuQ: this is probably not needed. 3-3 defense.... which I'll stop talking about now for awhile =\]]
;W[il];B[im]SQ[kp][ks]C[TsuQ: white, these moves are bigger and need to be answered]

(;W[gk];B[hm];W[gm];B[in];W[io];B[fe];W[ee];B[ed]C[TsuQ: If b has something here maybe it can be played more aggressively... this move doesnt give b much besides a threat to come into whites territory]

(;W[de]C[TsuQ:  I didnt like this at first, but because of the open area its needed...]
;B[gi];W[fi];B[gh];W[hg]
(;B[ig];W[gj];B[hi];W[fh];B[gf];W[jk]C[Here's where everything started to go wrong.  I get the feeling that I should have sealed up the hole at K9 earlier (perhaps with my last move), but I also feel that I should have had a better response than the one I gave.  What did I need to do here to prevent what follows, and what could I have done to better control the damage?

TsuQ: Right, black is short on liberties so this is dangerous, but I think you may be ok here...]
;B[kk];W[kl];B[jm];W[kj]C[TsuQ: at this point, white cannot cut you off yet, and the ladders around here dont seem to work...]

(;B[ki];W[lk];B[lj];W[kk]
(;B[lh]C[TsuQ: I understand the worry over lack of liberties... you might consider extending also so white does not get the atari.]
;W[mj];B[li]
(;W[nk];B[ml]C[TsuQ:  very good.];W[mk]
(;B[ll]C[TsuQ:  this doesn't seal white cleanly on this side because your stones are weak up against whites strength.]

(;W[ni]C[TsuQ:  white can probably go one more because of shape]

(;B[oj]C[TsuQ: white has no need to answer this because is doesnt threaten the connection.]
;W[oh]C[TsuQ:  right response.];B[nj];W[mi]
(;B[mh]C[TsuQ:  cutting off too close is going to leave white behind you.]
;W[ok];B[pk]C[TsuQ: you dont want to get into a skin fight with a group that has infinite liberties, so be careful not to get cut off (I think this might be working ok here...)]

(;W[nl]C[TsuQ: these two stones aren't important, neither side should play for them.]

(;B[lm];W[kp];B[lp];W[pg]
(;B[nh]C[TsuQ: this is probably only hurting your group inside...]
;W[oi];B[pi]
(;W[om]C[TsuQ: white, area with the most space is best... I'd like to see something along the right]
;B[pm]C[TsuQ: good, this was getting dangerous for those stones.]
;W[nn];B[mo]C[TsuQ: good to try to protect the cut.];W[mn]C[TsuQ: after 3 stones this time? A move on the top or right is bigger now i think. (for both sides)]
;B[ln];W[no]
(;B[mq];W[np];B[nq];W[mp];B[lo];W[ks];B[ls];W[js];B[lr];W[pp]
;B[pq];W[qq]
(;B[op]C[TsuQ: use the atari to close up the side more if you are going to use it.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[on]
(;B[ph]C[TsuQ: This move is ok, but as a general rule of perfect information games, assume that your opponent will always make the best move so don't expect to cut off this stone.]

(;W[og]C[TsuQ:  good, the open moves let black close off more here.]
;B[pn];W[oo];B[pl]C[TsuQ: I think if you read this you will find it is not so much of a problem now as letting white make trouble on the top and top right, because white will have to win the ko many times before getting anything from playing here.]
;W[qf];B[qe]
(;W[pe];B[oe];W[pf]
(;B[of]TR[od][qd]C[TsuQ: Leaving this kind of cutting point setup is trouble...]
;W[qd];B[od]
(;W[ng]C[TsuQ: I cant say this is bad... but..]
(;B[nf]C[TsuQ: at some point black is going to need to jump out probably now is best.]
;W[mg];B[lg]C[TsuQ: theres some go proverb about squeezing toothpaste or something... don't squeeze the opponent through your lines like this.]
;W[mf];B[me];W[lf];B[le];W[kf];B[jg];W[je];B[ie];W[id];B[hd]

(;W[hf];B[he];W[ff];B[ge];W[ch]C[TsuQ: Can't argue with making sure here... the corner move at R17 is still quite big though.]
;B[ke];W[jf];B[hl]C[TsuQ: you forced him to atari you with no profit...]
;W[hk];B[ji];W[ic];B[hc];W[kd];B[jc];W[ib];B[jb];W[ja];B[hb]
;W[ia];B[ha];W[ka];B[kb];W[la];B[lb];W[ma];B[mb];W[na]C[TsuQ: you're losing a stone for every point of territory black has to use to take, so nothing is really happening here except black gets a little stronger.]
;B[nb];W[nd]
(;B[ne]C[not needed, corner still biggest.];W[nc];B[oc];W[re]
C[TsuQ:  good, r17 is probably better in the corner, but this is good on the side.]

(;B[qc]C[TsuQ: I think it might be better to protect the side but its hard to say.]
;W[rc];B[qb];W[rb]
(;B[qg]
(;W[rg];B[qh]C[TsuQ: the big knights jump on the edge of the board is a good reduction which should work here.]

(;W[rh];B[ri];W[si];B[sj]C[TsuQ: usually this shape is too dangerous to support blocking like this.]

(;W[sh];B[rj];W[qa];B[pa];W[ra]
(;B[pb];W[gc]C[TsuQ: this isn't actually a threat since the J19 stones are in atari, and the inside stones have enough liberties and connections out.]
;B[fd]C[TsuQ:  right, not needed L13 is a point and P8 is a snapback threat]
;W[gb]C[TsuQ: right... it seems white thinks he is killing black, but black can make another eye at L13, and more importantly the J19 stones are in atari]

(;B[qn]C[TsuQ: I don't think this is needed, but the R3 tone is a bit troublesome.]
;W[go];B[kg];W[nm];B[cq]SQ[cn][dp][gq]C[Having realized that my territory had been decimated and that I was far behind, I desperately tried an invasion.  While it turned out that I did enough damage to win me the game, I have doubts about this particular attack's strategic soundness.  Should I have gotten away with as much as I did here?  Could I have done better?  What could white have done to halt this attack in its tracks?

TsuQ: Yes, this is probably too late... an invasion earlier was important. I think this formation should be able to defend against this invasion.]

;W[ap];B[bp];W[dk];B[en];W[ck]

;B[ek];W[ej];B[ep];W[eq];B[fo];W[be]C[TsuQ: understandable given the previous sequence. I don't think black can invade there however.]
;B[fn];W[gn];B[fk]SQ[qe][rf][ej][ho][gp]C[TsuQ: no need to worry about the stones above, even if they get cut off they have all the eyespace they need, so the cut isn't an issue]
