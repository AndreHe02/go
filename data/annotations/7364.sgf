C[Hi my name is Brett Lee and i played black in this game. I havent played a lot latley but I am creating a go club at my college USf. I want to have a respectable rank by the end of august so i decided to have some of my games reviewed. This game was only lost by half a point but that was due to an opponents mistake. If there are any books or game records you reccomend I would appreciate the advide. Thank you

Hey Brett!  My name is Jeremy West.  I've been playing Go pretty much nonstop since May, and plan to make a club at my college as well :-) If you 're ever on KGS, don't hesitate to look me up, jemwest, for a ranked, teaching game, or even a review.  I enjoy sharing what I've learned about Go.  To answer your general questions, I've never read any books on Go yet.  However, I've heard of one book from KGS kibitz that a couple dan players suggested "Lessons in the fundamentals".  I don't remember who it's by, but you can check it out.  However, I do have a few online tools that I use quite extensively.  First, if you want to learn joseki, http://www.brugo.be/ rocks.  Remember though, that the first time you learn joseki, your playing will most likely get weaker because you don't know when or why to use it and when to deviate.   That'll come with experience as you use it more, so stick with it.  For a more general reference, http://senseis.xmp.net/ is great.  Has answers to almost anything you need.  You can search, or go to starting points.  Finally, a quick way to improve is with Go Problems.  Therefore, almost any book with Go problems will help you, but if you don't want to spend the money http://www.goproblems.com/ works really well.  Sensei's Library also has some problems.  Make sure to read everything out before looking at the solutions.  Hope those help, I know they helped me.  I'll make sure to comment on what I see here.]
;B[qd];W[pp]C[Blee25 [18k\]: hi gg];B[dc]C[This is an opening I favor as well.  Emphasizes territory.]
;W[dp];B[po]LB[qn:A]C[Very uncommon to actually touch on an approach.  Usually save touching moves for defensive moves, you almost always want to attack from a distance.  Touching a stone tends to strengthen it. More common, and my personal favorite, is A.  More approaches on Brugo and their joseki.]
;W[oo];B[qn]LB[pn:A]C[Stretching at A would be better shape.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[qp]C[Now white has to corner and influence on the bottom, while you just have influnce on the right.]
;B[on];W[no];B[nk]LB[qi:A][pj:B][qj:C]C[I'm not sure what this move does.  If you want to strengthen your group here, making a base at A, B, or even C (in that order imo) is a better move, and goes along with your 3-4 opening taking pretty much the entire right side.  This move pretty much asks for invasion.]
;W[nm];B[om];W[ol];B[pl];W[ok];B[pk];W[oj];B[pj]C[Now that stone is in trouble.]
;W[jc]LB[ce:A][de:B][fc:C]C[Weird...  Approaches like A or B, and sometimes C, are more common.  This allows black to strengthen his position, so it's a "thank you" move.]
;B[oc]C[As you do, very good enclosure.];W[mc];B[me]LB[nd:A]
[gc:B]C[This is a pretty weak move. WA would give you bad shape.  It's somewhat unnecessary and small, the entire left side of the board is still open.  Since this group has a base, it's already pretty strong so don't try to attack it.  However, if you really want to play that way I'd suggest B to give your corner stone a base and to prevent white from extending even further.  See variations.]

(;W[ld];B[md];W[nd];B[nc]C[Good move to take advantage of whites shape.]
;W[mb];B[ne]LB[oe:A]C[A would've been better, using the net tesuji (if you don't know it, look it up on sensei's library). That way you don't have to worry about it anymore, and it has good shape and influence.]
;W[le]
(;B[ce]LB[gc:A][cn:B][cm:C][fq:D]C[Good.  I like A better with how you were playing, to put more pressure on white but this works too.  B and C might be better as well, white will most likely respond with a move like D, and you can build a base.  See variation a move previous.]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[rn]
(;B[ql]C[See variation.];W[rm];B[pi]LB[cj:A][fq:B]C[Ok, so this is a problem I had when I was 18k as well.  It's kinda funny, because at 13k I've come full circle and have the opposite problem.  Pretty much, you focus too much locally.  Consider the point value of each move your making, as opposed to a move such as A or B.  Huge parts of the board are open, and you're both inching for points like it's yose.  Understand, sometimes you need to strengthen your groups (that's my problem right now), but really consider right now that there are moves still on the board worth MUCH more than the moves your making locally.]
;W[mf];B[nf]C[For example, did you really need to move here?  Was it truly necessary?  What is the worse white can do?  If you can possibly ignore it, do so and take the bigger points while you still can.  Build moyos and influence on the sides while white takes individual points and stones.  Constantly look at the big picture and ask yourself, "are their bigger point moves or more important moves elsewhere?"  In this case, I think the worse white could've done is force you to capture O16, which could lose you probably 4 points maybe?  While a move on the side could gain you 10 points.  Just try to think about playing faster and as you do you'll see what works and what doesn't, when you can ignore a move and when you can't.]
;W[mg];B[ng];W[lh]
(;B[ch]LB[cj:A]C[In this case, go ahead and be greedy and go for A.  If white pincers you, it really isn't a problem.  See variation on the move previous.]
;W[cj]C[White was smart and took that move from you :-)];B[gc]
LB[cn:A][cm:B]C[Good move.  At this point though, white is a little stronger and her extension is very large.  A possible way to punish is at A or B, although that's just asking for a fight.]
;W[hd];B[hc]C[Slow.  Bottom is still open.  Plus, you're kinda helping white here by allowing her to strengthen her moyo she's building.]
;W[ic];B[dj]LB[cn:A][cm:B]C[Again, touch to defend not to attack.  The distance move in this case is the approach A or B.  Ignore variation.]

(;W[dk];B[ei]LB[di:A][ej:B][ci:C]C[Again, good advice is stretch on the hane.  This gives white plenty of aji.  I personally would've taken WA, BB, WC.]
;W[ej];B[di];W[fj];B[fi];W[gh];B[gj];W[gk];B[fk];W[ek];B[fl]
;W[gl];B[ci];W[gi];B[ck];W[cl];B[bk];W[dl]TR[gj][fk][fl]LB[ni:A]
C[I think you can see why this result is bad for you.  The marked stones are pretty much dead, so WA would build a huge moyo that takes pretty much the entire middle and bottom part of the board.]
;B[ni]C[Almost as if you read my mind.  Good, although something needed to be done about this much earlier.  The overall mistake was letting white get so much influence and thickness.]
;W[nj];B[mi];W[lj];B[mj];W[mk];B[oi];W[nl];B[li];W[ki];B[lk]
;W[kj];B[ml];W[nk];B[mm];W[nn];B[mn]C[Alright, another general suggestion here.  Don't try too hard to kill stones.  If you try too hard, you'll find that white will become stronger than she was.  Only attack stones and/or territory if you get something concrete from that move other than the possibility of taking stones/territory.]
;W[mo];B[lo];W[ln];B[lm];W[kn];B[km];W[jm];B[mh]C[These stones were dead awhile ago.  A group either needs an escape route or a base, and if a group loses the chance for both it's dead.  Trust me, it's very difficult to make eyespace in the middle of the board, particularly when white has so much influence up there ^^]
;W[lg];B[bm]TR[fj][cl][ej][ek][dk][dl]LB[fq:A][hp:B][hq:C]C[Like this.  I'm assuming you're threatening the marked group.  If not, I'm not sure what you're doing.  It doesn't give you much territory and doesn't really threaten to invade the moyo much more than a little bit.  If that's what you wanted, an invasion at A needed to happen a long time ago, but now W can just pincer at B or C and you're stone doesn't have a base and has nowhere to run.]
;W[cn]LB[dn:A]C[A would've been a stronger escape.];B[bn];W[bo]
;B[cm];W[dm]
(;B[bl]LB[co:A]C[Use the aji at A before connecting back.  See variation.]
;W[co];B[fg];W[gg];B[gf];W[hf];B[ff];W[ge];B[fe];W[gd];B[fd]
C[I think the biggest thing you should learn about this is that moyos become more and more difficult to invade as the game wears on.  That's why if you see the signs of one, like good thickness and influence with supporting moves, try to find a way to take care of it immediately.  However, as I said earlier, make sure that you get something concrete from the moves anyways.  If the attack fails, you want to have gained something.]
;W[qf];B[jn]LB[gq:A]C[Good.  W14 was pointless.  Although this move doesn't do much either.  I would say your best option here would be to try something at A.  It would be difficult to live, but it has a pretty high chance.]
;W[ko];B[lp];W[jo];B[jl];W[in];B[im];W[jn];B[op];W[kl];B[np]
;W[ll];B[kq]C[This wound up working well for you too, and sometimes that's the only way to get into a moyo: by using aji.  However, don't expect higher ranked players to make similar mistakes :-) Take care of moyos early.]
;W[or];B[nr];W[mr];B[mq];W[ns];B[nq];W[ms];B[lr];W[oq];B[ls]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[jq];B[os]C[Do that earlier.  Although it may have resulted the same.]

C[I fail to see the point of this move.];W[hr];B[hs];W[gr];B[gs]

;W[do];B[cq];W[aq]LB[cp:A]C[Darn.  If you left A to die, you would lose 1 point.  While if you had moved W88, you would get 9 points.]
;B[ao];W[ap];B[an];W[hb];B[gb];W[ha];B[ga];W[ib];B[fc]C[Not necessary.  Take a sente move elsewhere.]

Just remember to not let your opponent build moyos if you can help it, and try to play bigger in the opening.
