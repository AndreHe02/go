C[cjmichael [5k\]: hello

cjmichael: Hi.  Thanks in advance for the review.  Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated, especially in mid game.  I felt I gave up too much of the middle.]

maybe this was the problem in the joseki...];W[qp];B[qq]CR[np]

cjmichael: I don't really know the best joseki given the situation.




this is a good question, and I haven't seen this variation but who knows.. the most often variations against wo6 are black o4 instead of o3. Then you would'nt have got the same result as what happened in the game.]

cjmichael: I admit this was ill thought.












It was a good idea to strengthen the shape of blacks group with the tesuji. However, to protect the upper side seems even more urgent to me.]
;W[rf];B[rg];W[sf];B[qf]C[



but I don't agree with this followup, because you are making white stones stronger and giving more points away.
You may be right in strengthening weak stones in front of an already strong group though]
;W[qe];B[qg];W[rd];B[sg];W[se];B[jc];W[ne]C[I think this sort of move is a bit slow, since white is strong in the corner, and black has more or less two weak groups on the side, white has miai to attack on the upper side or lower right. If you want to attack to the lower right, it is common practive to lean on the upper side before.]

this attachment makes black stronger, so there is a wrong concept of attacking here.]

this "peep" is normally used when the position is a bit different than here, I don't understand its context now.]

cjmichael: I thought I'd play a bit looser since he had a large framework here.  Probably a bad idea.

this move protects the less urgent cutting point, I think this was the big mistake.]

cjmichael: I think I should have continued to run at J11.  This move was just bad, possibly game losing?






A:  J11 would have not been enough because of the weak group on the right side. now white can gets A in sente and  try going for the capture.]
;W[lh];B[li]C[



A: I question this move. I think instead protecting the eyeshape of the right side would have been better, because it leaves a chance for later.]

A: I tried and I couldn't, sorry. I see there are many ctting points, but I think white could have handeled them without loosing much.
