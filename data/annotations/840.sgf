;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[fd];B[ch]LB[dh:a]C[i think this stone is better at d12 since it would  work better with black's lower stones, which are  fourth-rank]
;W[kc];B[jq]LB[jp:a]C[this looks kind of passive to me, as if  the players are just moving on their own sides of the board... i think k4 is  better here, since that gives your stone fighting placement and it will  coordinate your stones' framework better i believe (i am not totally sure if  k4 is better however).]
;W[qn];B[pn]LB[jp:a]C[i think this is an interesting  move, but this would be even better i think, if there were a black stone at  k4.]
;W[qm]LB[pm:a]C[standard is q7 i think];B[pm]LB[om:a]C[nice move, after white doesnt follow the joseki.  p7 looks  nice  too.]
;W[pl];B[nm];W[ol];B[nl];W[qp];B[qq];W[rp];B[qr];W[oi];B[nj]
LB[mj:a]C["you  should not touch your opponent's stones unless you want to make him  stronger."  i think n10 is better, because of this rule.]
;W[ni]LB[mj:a]C[now white's position in the UR looks very nice and n10 might  come in handy for white later.]
;B[cn]TR[ni][oi]LB[mi:a][dn:b]C[difficult.   where should black move?  should he invade or build up his position?   perhaps n11, grabbing an important point?  as we will see later in the game,  the o11 and p11 stones help white out a lot.  as it was, black chose to  solidify his position, but perhaps d6 is better, because that would be a  power-move, which would work well with black's stones on the  right.]
;W[eq]C[an unusual point for invasion, i think];B[gq]LB[dq:a]
C[more  usual is d3 i think.  usually, when your opponent touches your stones, you  should respond there.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[ep];B[do];W[gp];B[fp]LB[hp:a]C[interesting... h4 is more usual and  probably safer.]
;W[fo];B[fq];W[eo];B[hq]LB[em:a][en:b][hp:c]C[the three  stones were safe.  perhaps e6 is better, since that side looks a little  weaker, and it is generally good to push from the weaker side, and also,  pushing from e6 or e7 will give black power which could affect what happens  in the top of the board.  however, if black wants to push from this side, h4  is better.]
;W[em];B[go]LB[cl:a][ck:b][ho:c]C[i think a better strategy would be c8 or  c9, since you would wall white off from the bottom, while at the same time  gaining territory.

if you want to push from this side, h5 looks better i think.]
;W[gn]C[a  strong response by white];B[ho];W[hn];B[in]C[an interesting exchange ensues;  white gains power while black gains territory.  i am not sure who is better  off for this.]
;W[im];B[jn];W[il];B[kk]C[you probably had one of two intentions making this move: you were  trying to make territory between walss (a bad thing to do) or you were  trying to prepare an invasion.  with the power this sequence gives white on  the right, and the smallness of the invasion you make, i think this is  probably a bad move.  if you want to make territory, c8 or c9 would be  better, i think, but finding the proper place direction in the game right  now is hard.]
;W[ij];B[ki];W[ih]TR[ki][kk]LB[kg:a]C[with black's last two  moves, white was able to build up some nice-looking power on the left.  now  black can move at l13, but this wasnt really white's territory, before.  so  it does not seemas if black has neceassarily made any progress with this  sequence.  perhaps white's stones would have been better elsewhere; i am not  sure.  as it is, white's position looks much better right now.

black ought to invade.];B[ee]TR[ch][ce]LB[ck:a][bc:b][dk:c]
[qc:d][kg:e]C[by  touching white's stones, you will strengthen them.  if you wish to  strengthen c12 and c15, then c9, d9 or b17 might be better moves.  r17 seems  like the best point of invasion; then black should think about a move the  fortify the territory on the left, or l13, with all of white's power around  there.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[hf];B[fg]C[as you make territory here on the left, white is  turning his moyo into territory on the right.  white's gains appear larger  than black's with these moves.  at the least, this move is  gote.]
;W[gg]LB[gf:a]C[gives white bad shape.  better is  g14.];B[gf]
;W[ge];B[ed];W[fc]LB[ec:a]C[i think e17 is playable, if  unattractive.  in any case, i think f17 is as much bad shape as e17, so why  not just play e17?]
;B[ec]LB[dk:a][qc:b]C[again, d9 and r17 seem like an important points, and  if these two, r17 seems the biggest.]
;W[eb];B[cc]LB[hg:a]C[locally, h12  might be better, since it could cause some  fighting.]
;W[db];B[ii];W[hi];B[ji];W[gi];B[gh];W[hg];B[fi];W[cl]LB[qc:a]
C[a good move by white, but perhaps he should  protect the corner with r16, since a move at r17 would be fairly big at this  point.  or perhaps white should try to enclose black somehow.]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[ek]LB[ck:a]C[i think c9 is bigger,  locally.]
;W[gk];B[lg]LB[qc:a]C[again, r17 might be better, but black has the  right idea with this move: diminish white's huge moyo.]

;B[mm];W[am]C[games with large moyos are always difficult.  you should remember  that when your opponent has a large moyo, it is wise to invade early.    another thing to keep in mind is how to handle your stones: every stone  affects every other stone; make sure they work together.]
