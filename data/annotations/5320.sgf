C[   [Zorro\]: Hi, thanks for review our game. Please, show our mistakes and what we could do better.
   Ah, one question, what do we have to do to reach to 9k? Sometimes it seems impossible... T_T
  Thanks very very much! =D
___________________________________________


You both are working toward a worthy goal. With more study and patience, I am sure that you will attain it. I gather from the email that you are estimating your current rating from playing against Gnugo. Let me make a couple of remarks about that. I think that Gnugo is a really neat program. I have done a very small amount of work on it myself. There is a big problem with assigning a rating to a computer program. All present Go programs have serious weaknesses and human players will, even unconsciously, learn to exploit those weaknesses, if they play against the program repeatedly. Your estimation of your rating at 13k may be reasonable, but unfortunately, it may be lower if you have been playing Gnugo a lot. To the extent that you are interested in your rating and improving it, I would try to find a larger group of players with a well defined rating to play against. For many people, including myself, the internet is the best option. You might consider Dragon, if IGS or KGS do not work for you. Dragon lets you play a slower, more carefully studied game. Another thing about ratings is that they are not consistant between groups of players.

I make a number of comments throughout the game. I hope that they are helpful to both of you. The game his several huge capturing races. In playing these it is important to be aware of the strength of your group and your opponents group at all times. Study of Life and Death problems can help develop your awareness of the number of eyes in a complicated group and moves that shift the balance of strength between the groups.]
;B[jj]C[
This is not really a good opening move, even though it seems natural. B is giving up a chance at playing in one of the corners first.  Usually you play corners, then sides, then center, because it is easiest to make a strong live group in the corner.]
;W[oc];B[pe];W[ld];B[ph];W[ed];B[eo]TR[pe][ph]LB[pp:A]C[
This is an unusual placement in the corner. It works somewhat with B's center stone, but does not have a rlationship with the triangle stones. I like A better. It maps out a loose sphere of influence on the right side, like W has at the top.]
;W[pp]C[
Good move! W takes a point that B would like to have. If B could play here, he would have a large sphere of influence.]
;B[df]LB[cd:A]C[
At first I liked this move because it seems to work together with B's center stone and lower left stone. However I cnnot find it in my joseki books. That doesn't mean it is necessarily bad, but it makes me question it. The usual joseki move is A and W's reply there seems very natural and profitable.]
;W[cd];B[ci]LB[df:A]C[
This move seems awkward to me and again makes me question the move at A.]
;W[fq]LB[dp:A]C[
This is a strange approach move to an unusual move by B. I would be inclined to play A here. B's stone is high, so it is natural for W to go lower. If B continues to play on the outside, W can build a big position in the corner.]
;B[dq]C[
Good move! This works well B's other stones. It maps out territory and attacks W's stone]
;W[ip]C[
This is a reasonable reply.];B[qn]C[
Good move! Works well with B's other stones.];W[mq];B[rp]
(;W[pk]LB[qj:A]C[
I am not sure, but I think that a deeper invasion such as A might be better. This is where B gets some benefit from his unusual move in the center. W is going to need to escape and B is already out there.]
;B[on]C[
Good move. W would like to play here.];W[nl];B[mn];W[lo]C[
This is bad. W wants to strengthen his lower side but his 2 weak stones are hurt further by B's reply.]
;B[ln];W[ko];B[ll];W[mj];B[li];W[mi];B[lh];W[mh];B[mg];W[ng]
;B[mf];W[nf];B[ne]TR[mf][mg]LB[qc:A][hn:B]C[
The last few moves are a pattern. B is chasing some weak whit stones which are trying to escape. It is easy for both sides to get caught up in this and play too many moves in the same pattern. You have evaluate the strength of the groups as you go. At this point W is very weak and needs to get 2 eyes. On the other hand, if W lives B's triangle stones have cutting points and are a little weak themselves. B could consider letting W escape and taking the big point at A or playing for a huge moyo at B.]

A is better. See alternate line.];W[oe];B[nd];W[od];B[le];W[jd]

;B[rh];W[qi];B[pj];W[pi];B[oi];W[oj];B[nj]
(;W[qj]LB[ok:A]C[
B looks to have only one eye. W wants to solidify his wall and prevent B from making forcing moves to escape. 
A is better becuase B has no atari as a reply. See alternate.]
;B[ok];W[pj];B[nk];W[ni];B[ol];W[pl];B[om];W[pn];B[pm];W[po]
C[
These last 2 moves seem dangerous for W. It is a capuring race between 2 groups that do not have 2 eyes. I don't think that this move helps W in that race.]

(;B[ql];W[qh]C[
This is the vital point, if B had played here he would win the race.]

;W[gb]C[
This move doesn't accomplish anything. It just forces B to make the obvious reply]
;B[ga];W[cf];B[cg];W[de];B[bf];W[be];B[bg];W[ef];B[dg];W[eg]
;B[fe]LB[eh:A]C[
I'll grant that the next few moves to away W's eyespace, but the real important point here is A.  B needs to play at A to expand his territory and make good any threat to kill W.]

;W[ba];B[hq]LB[eh:A][ac:B]C[
Again, A is the move. It still threatens to kill W if followed by B]
;W[hp];B[gq];W[gp];B[fp];W[hm]TR[gq][hq]LB[fr:A]C[
B's triangle stones are not really alive after W plays A. B would like to have played around W's present move. He should have done so rather than the triangle moves.]
;B[el];W[gj];B[fi];W[ig]
(;B[hh];W[ih];B[ii];W[jh];B[oq]
(;W[qq]LB[pq:A][op:B]C[
This is a capturing race. B's invading stone has 4 lberties. W's 3 stones have 5 liberties.  W is ahead in the race, but he needs to capture the black stone to live. He should take away a liberty with A or B. See alternates.]

[sg][rh]SQ[pp][po][pn][qq]C[
OK. Looking at the board now. All of the triangle black stones are dead. Or at least they will be if W is careful. W's square stones are dead. Both W's and B's other stones should live. B has a fair amount of territory on the left and lower right, but the huge number of dead stones means that he is way behind.  W must make some terrible mistakes to let B win. Let us see what they are.]
