C[Hello thank you for doing this review for me. I feel it started off ok enough for me playing as black but it just started to slip away from me as it, this is the usual case and is the thing i want to try to avoid.

This game is a representative sample of the terrible way i have been playing, I cannot get past 10k, and when I reach that rank I eventually slip to 12k only to get back to 10k where ..i fall back down to 12k :p

1) Sometimes you make a so called 'thank you move'. 
Thank you moves are sente moves that are not good for you, but are good for your opponent. When you make a move and your opponent answers this move, then you gain something and your opponent gains something else. A sente move is good if you gain more than you opponent. With a thank you move your opponent gains more.
Compare a 'thank you move' with 'Spit me in my face or I will shoot you.'.

2) Play non-contact moves when you are attacking.

3) Fight your own plan. Do not always answer your opponents moves.]

This is a good move! Why?

Good for you!!!];B[rl];W[nj]
(;B[oi]C[I prefer an other move.

The black group at the right side is alive.

White O10 is not really an attacking move, so you can  choose to play somewhere else. E.g. D5 is an interesting point for black, see variation move 33.

Do not always answer your opponents move. Fight your own plan! After O10 you have the chance to do so.]
;W[oj]
(;B[pi]C[Too shy!

If you want to play in this area, play O11. Q11 is not really a weak point for you, see also variation move 35.]
;W[mm]C[Good move];B[mn]C[Good move.];W[lm];B[ln];W[km];B[op]
TR[nm][qm][ln][mn][on][qn][rn][sn][qp][rp]CR[lp][lq]C[A thank you move.
Black gets only few points. White gets more at the lower side of the board.

The marked black stones (triangle) are all alive and connected.
E.g. if white attacks with Q5 or O5, it is easy for black to stay connected.
P4 would be a good move if you had problems with the connection between the marked stones. Now you make white stronger with P3 and also your own group (but your group doesn't need reinforcement)

When you are attacking your opponent usually non-contact moves are the best.
When you play around or on the marked places (circle) you attack the white stones and you get more in return (controll over some part of the lower side).]
;W[oq];B[mp]TR[nq]CR[ec][jd][do]C[cluelessj: I feel this was a mistake, I was aiming at o3

When we look at the moves 41 till 50 then we can conclude that white gained more than black.

White does make territory and a very strong group at the lower side. Black has a strong group after move 50, but on the other hand that was also the fact before move 41. So little improvement for black; also blacks territory isn't really bigger after move 50 than it was before.

If you want to attack, you usually need non-contact moves. 

Good option:
Explore an other part of the board: there it is a lot easier to make points. If you have a strong group, you can leave it alone and make points on an other part of the board.
Marked places (circle) are possibilities to make points elsewhere.]
;W[no];B[nn];W[mq];B[lp];W[lq];B[kp];W[kq]C[Please look again at the moves 41 till 50. White gained more than black.]

C[I prefer D11.

C16 is also on the third line.
C10 is too close to the black wall.];W[ec];B[hd];W[fd];B[ee]
;W[dd];B[de];W[cc];B[ed]LB[db:A][gb:B]TR[de][ee]C[This is a thank you move.

This move is sente for you, but it is not a good move for you. It is a good move for you opponent.

Without  black E16 the white group has a weakness at A. After black E16 and white D17 the white groups hasn't got a weakness. 

What does white gain by E16 and D17?
Well, white defends his weakness!

What does black gain by E16 at this moment?
Almost nothing! E16 does not kill a white group or take territory.

The marked black stones (triangle) have lost a liberty. The group of two stones had got 5 liberties, the group now has got only 4 liberties. 

Note that this is NOT the moment to play A! It is to early in the game to do so. But maybe later, if you get a black stone on or near B, then you can play A. If white answers A with D17, you can connect A with B.

Summary:
Black plays a sente move, white defends a weak point, black gains (almost) nothing and loses a liberty. That's better for white!

Remember: Not all sente moves are good moves.];W[dc];B[bd];W[bc]

;W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc];W[ge]C[This is a very important move for white: G14 is interesting for black.]
;B[gd]TR[ed][de][ee]CR[fg][kj][fo]C[This isn't a good move.

1) You cannot cut.

2) You upper side doesn't become stronger.

3) You force white to take a liberty from the marked group (triangle). The marked stones become weaker, by losing liberties. 

Better moves are: F13, F5 or L10];W[fe];B[ff]TR[ce][ef]C[Two weak points (triangle marked places)]
;W[he];B[id];W[gf];B[fg];W[ad];B[be]C[B14 is better.
The shape is better.];W[fj]C[It is usually moves like thisby white  that cause me to lose the game, sure enough, the same thing happened here, in fact  my group was even killed :(.]
;B[hj]TR[gf][km][fp]C[F10 doesn't have enough room to live inside the black moyo. White F10 has to connect. 

White does have three options (the marked stones). It is very hard to block all the three connections at the same time.

So you strategy is not to block all the possible connections. Your strategy is to gain something while attacking. See the variations move 101.]
;W[fl]C[I was not trying to kill white, just make white run for a bit trying to stake myself out a little bit in the centre]

(;B[gk]C[This is not a good move, it makes white stronger!]
;W[fk];B[fn];W[gi];B[gg];W[hh];B[gj]C[This is not a good move.

Black has a bad shape (empty triangle).

You cannot cut white.];W[fi];B[hg];W[ih];B[ig]LB[ig:1][jh:2]
TR[gj][hj][nj][oj][gk][nl][ol][pl][ql][km][lm][mm]SQ[ki][jj]
[kj][jk][kk]C[With black 1 you force white to play 2.

2 is an attack on the marked black stones (triangle).
2 makes it for white easier to connect his two groups.

So you force your opponent to attack your stones!


It is hard to say what is the best move in this situation, but it is better to play somewhere on the square marked points, because:
1) it does help the marked black (weak) stones
2) it keeps the white groups apart.

It is not bad for you if white connects F10 with his stones at the top. If you can kill the marked white stones in return, it is good for you.

I hope you get the idea: you cannot break every white connection, but if white connects somewhere you have to get something in return!]

C[I do not mind losing but it is just so frustrating to keep losing this way ^^ Especially when things are ok at the start.


Summary:
1) Try to avoid "thank you moves". 
Ask yourself: what do I gain, what does my opponent gain? 
You have to gain more than your opponent!!!

2) Play non-contact moves when you are attacking.

3) Fight your own plan. Do not always answer your opponents moves.

I hope you will enjoy go as much as I do!!!
It is a very interesting game to play and I hope you will have lots of fun with it in the future.]

The white group at the side is very small, only about 2 or 3 points.
The 2 marked white stones are weak. No eyes and placed near a strong black wall.

Black is connected! This is important!
(E.g. white Q9, black P9, Q10, P10, Q11, Q12 and a ladder)
Black has a strong wall. The wall is a much better result for black, then the small white group at the side.]
