C[Hi, my name is Guillaume, I'm pleased to have a chance to review your game. As requested, I'll comment on White moves.]

No, I agree. if you pincer, get tighter
especially because the extension for this stone is not ideal]
;B[ck];W[cf];B[ce];W[df]C[White feels over concentrated (not its ideal extension from a 2 stones wall)]
;B[be]C[Is it sente? It's a base for sure but it's a move on the second line (lower value. There may be more interesting options on the board)]

[hp:C][rr:B]C[This placement move is questionnable. Even if it works, there are more attractive moves on the board (C may be too much to ask for but it keeps pressure on the two stones. Save those second line moves for later.]

(;W[jp];B[jq];W[lp];B[cm]TR[jp][lp]C[I think it wasn't a good idea, cause this moves should give me an influence on right side, but there is no space to use this influence

Agreed. It gives some support to your corner stones but S2 would be more effective]
;W[fn]C[This is too much within Black's influence. Black's response is appropriate. This feels too "jealous" as a play.]

[kq][jr][lr][js][ks]C[You did ask for your critical mistakes in the game.
I find your moves quite fine overall. You know how to lean against stones to get some effects. You have a good shape sense.

For me, not looking for opportunity to get sente and not using the sente to play on the most important moves is the biggest flaw in the game. You should ask yourself at any point in the game: "do I really have to respond in this position?. What actually happens if I do not?"
You should always have some idea on where to play if you have the sente and look for opportunities to get those.

There are very little points in the center and it takes a lot of moves to build them. Similarly, playing on the second and first lines are moves for the endgame and should only be played earlier if those are moves to kill or to live.

Be also careful about the fuseki move. When selecting a location to play, try to run a few very simple variations in your head to see what the positions whould look like after the most likely exchanges. If the shape doesn't look pleasant for you, look for a better position to play from.
Playing right in the middle may not be the best move.

Let me know if you have any further questions (don't hesitate to add more questions or thoughts you had in the game for future reviews. It helps make sure those questions are tackled). Cheers.]
