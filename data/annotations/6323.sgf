C[What blows I should do to get more territory?

Hello, sorry for taking so long, I had some trouble getting internet.

I found this game to be a bad choice for a review because the most basic principles of play were disregarded in most plays.

So I write some basic things here that can be applied in many situations in the game.]

the review ends here

to summarize:
Do life and death problems. There is a lot on the internet, I advise you to get a book anyways.

Get some book about the basics or read up on basics on the internet. You made a lot of simple mistakes and unneccesary plays. It's best to read a little bit about basic go principles.
(In the Beginning is a great book but you might want to look into something like "learn to play go" as it starts off easier and covers more)]

Learn the basic living and dead shapes (any beginners book can do this)
