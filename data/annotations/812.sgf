C[NOT CLASSICAL

More classical is to approach the corner first: "First the corner, then the side."   One reason for this is that  if Black approach the corner latter and  play a  Joseki in the corner, the move on the side risk to end up badly placed.

But, in my opinion, this move albeit being not common  is not a bad move, it is slack territorially but fast globally.]
;W[nq];B[df];W[ce];B[cf];W[de];B[cn]C[NEVER LET YOUR OPPONENT HANE AT THE HEAD OF TWO STONES

You cannot let two stones standing side by side like this, this is pornography, not Go.

The Joseki move is to Nobi at E-14. This move is mandatory.

Another move is to Hane at E-15, but in this position, White beeing already strong in the corner will cut at Q-14 and fight.

To summarize, when there are two stones standing side by side you want to hane, if you are afraid of your opponent cutting you have to nobi.

"Always hane at the head of two stones" (or 3, and even 4 stones).

He, who hane at the head of two stones will win the game, this is true 99% of time.

He, who hane at the head of three stones will win the game, this is true 95% of time.

He, who hane at the head of four stones will win the game, this is true 80% of time.

So always HANE HANE HANE and don't hesitate to NIDANBANE.

For reference, the Joseki move here was Black 11at E-14, White 12 at F-16, Black 13 at C-9.]
;W[fq]C[ALWAYS HANE AT THE HEAD OF TWO STONES
If White Hane at E-14, he will win the game (more than 99% chance in this case).

So HANE HANE HANE and hesitate to NIDANBANE.

It is not necessary at all to answer the approach move (Black 11).]
;B[dk];W[qf]C[ALWAYS HANE AT THE HEAD OF TWO STONES

If White Hane at E-14, he will win the game
(still more than 99% chance to win).

I cannot repeat this more than one hundred times.

This move was never played during half of the game, eventually White played Hane under at B-14 by move 132.

During half of the game, this move E-14 is always very hot. If White manages to get Sente and plays here he wins the game.]
;B[pn];W[pr];B[lo]C[WRONG DIRECTION
Black must instead pincer immediately at R-12 or Q-10

This move M-5 aim  to build a moyo on the right side.

This move would be good for Black, if it was absolute sente and Black could after play R-12 to pincer the White stone and build moyo. This would make ideal development on the right .

But White can answer M-5 at R-10 to spoil Black plan, and in this case Black has achieved nothing.]
;W[qq]C[NOT NECESSARY

Playing R-3 or L-3 are Miai. So, White doesn't need to answer here. It is really better to play R-10 or R-11 to spoil Black plan, the area around R-11 has become very hot now.]
;B[qh]C[GOOD FOR BLACK

This pincer and extension is ideal for Black.];W[qc];B[qd]C[Also playing Q-17 is possible.

It's difficult to say which is better.
Perhaps playing Q-17 is more tight territorially.];W[pc];B[od]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc];B[nd]C[GOOD FOR BLACK

Yes, pushing here is very good and absolutely mandatory.];W[mc]
;B[md];W[qj]C[NOT NECESSARY YET

Black cannot make the moyo territory with one move.
So White has still some time before invading.

White should play first hane at  E-14, then invade.];B[ql];W[ph]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[pg];W[rh];B[qg]C[BETTER TO TAKE THE STONE IMMEDIATELY

It makes good shape for Black (Ponnuki) and White does not get another Atari at Q-10.]
;W[pj];B[oi]C[BETTER TO TAKE THE STONE IMMEDIATELY

Yes, here also it is better to take the stone at P-12.

This remove all Aji. And if there is no Aji, White will have difficulties to live or escape.]
;W[oj];B[ni]C[BETTER TO HANE

To make Black territory grows.];W[nj];B[li]C[BETTER TO HANE

The Black territory around N-13 is getting very small, considering the number of stones he has invested here.]
;W[om];B[no];W[mn];B[mo];W[mj];B[kk]C[TOO THIN

This Keima is not possible in this position. It is better to play M-10.

Black position is as thin as rolling paper. White will torn him to pieces.]
;W[mi]C[GOOD

Torn him to pieces.];B[ng];W[lh];B[mh];W[mg];B[nh];W[lj];B[ki]
;W[kj];B[ih]C[TOO THIN

This Keima is not possible in this position.

Black position is as thin as rolling paper. White will torn him to pieces.

A little better is K-11 but the only move in this position is K-10.]
;W[ji]C[GOOD FOR WHITE

Torn him to pieces.];B[kh];W[jh];B[kg];W[jk]C[VERY GOOD RESULT FOR WHITE.]
;B[kl]C[STUPID

What's hell is worth that stone now, it's not a cutting stone. It's only a poor lonely weak and half-dead Black stone.By pulling this stone out, do you expect to kill White now?   That would be very stupid idea, because, now, it's Black that is weak here.

Better to play K-13.];W[jl];B[km];W[jg]C[GOOD FOR WHITE];B[he]
C[VAGUE LOOKING MOVE.

Does not achieve anything properly.

Better to play K-14 or E-14.];W[kf];B[lg];W[lf];B[mf];W[je]
;B[id];W[ld]C[NOT VERY GOOD

White is cutting Black groups that are already alive.

Better to push at K-7 and aim to play E-14.];B[kc]C[RAW PEEP

Very vulgar style.

Better to leave the possibility to cut here and play E-14.

Black have the possibility to  cut latter with L-16 so he can aim at attacking the White group.]
;W[lc]C[VERY GOOD RESULT FOR WHITE

Now White is strong and Black has weak positions.];B[hq];W[lq]
C[NOT NECESSARY TO STRAIN ONESELF

White has a good game now. He can simply answer at B-4. It's more simple.
  This gives White 10 points in the corner, stabilise a weak White group and aims at invading at C-8.

This looks more peaceful.];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co]
;B[er];W[dq]C[VERY BAD

This is absolutely vulgar style. It reinforces Black and helps nothing.

White instead should play E-3.];B[dr];W[dn];B[bn]C[ABUSIVE

Black cannot kill White, so he should simply cut at E-3, taking a valuable stone and let White live on the left side.]
;W[ao]C[NOT NECESSARY

It's look like White is cutting Black groups that are already alive at his own risks.   White should simply play D-7, letting Black connect, then G-5.]
;B[bl]C[BAD MOVE

Should be C-8.

The main defect of this move is that it let White play D-7 in Sente.]
;W[dm]C[GOOD MOVE

This is Sente and helps White shape];B[go]C[OVERPLAY
NO CHANCE FOR A STRONG ATTACK

Better to play C-8 or to cut at E-3.

This move G-5 attempt to attack the White group as a whole but since there is  weakness at C-8, Black cannot attack very strongly.

White can escape or live and Black will be left with weaknesses.]
;W[fo];B[fl]C[OVERPLAY
NO CHANCE FOR A STRONG ATTACK

Black should simply play G-6];W[gn]C[GOOD FOR WHITE

White is going out and leaving Black with defects.];B[gp];W[fp]
C[NOT NECESSARY

White should simply connect at F-6, it's better.];B[fm]C[RAW PEEP

Very vulgar style.

G-7 looks better like a Tesuji, here.];W[fn];B[in];W[fr];B[bs]
;W[ar]C[POINTLESS

No chance to kill the corner.];B[br];W[hm];B[im];W[hl];B[il]

;W[be];B[ee]C[LEAVES TOO MANY CUTTING POINTS

Better to play E-14];W[ed];B[fd];W[ef]C[WRONG TIMING

Better to cut first at C-13. Then Black must give at least one stone.]
;B[fe];W[cg];B[dg];W[ch];B[bh];W[dh];B[eg];W[cb]C[CAUTIOUS MOVE

White must think he is ahead to play like this.
It is very tempting to save the 5 White stones by playing F-11, because Black himself is not alive on the side.   I think that Black could not win a semeai with the White corner group.]
;B[ej];W[ek]C[ DANGEROUS FOR WHITE.

This is very greedy to try to recover the 5 White stones in this position.

This can even become dangerous and will probably not become very profitable for White.

White looks now very jealous.

One better idea for White is to play latter White F-11,White F-12, and White H-13 sacrificing the 5 White stones but capturing 3 Black stones.

The biggest Yose point looks like beeing S-5. If White plays it now, White should win.]
;B[dl];W[ei]C[BETTER AT F-11

Playing F-11instead of E-11 makes an eye.];B[fi]C[GOOD MOVE FOR BLACK

Surprise attack.];W[fj];B[eh];W[ej];B[gi];W[gk];B[hn];W[gm]
;B[cm];W[eo];B[em];W[eq];B[en];W[hr];B[ir];W[hs];B[fs]C[OVERPLAY   Black cannot kill White, so this move is overplay. It lose points for Black. It is better to connct at K-3. If he does so, now Black  has a won game.]
;W[is]C[THE LOOSING MOVE

White should play J-3 or K-2, and he cannot die. After crawling at J-1 the situation looks hopeless.]
;B[jr];W[js];B[kr];W[ff];B[gf];W[kp];B[jo];W[jp];B[ip];W[ko]

;B[nm]C[Dear Enrico,

you managed very well your attack.
Only Black 167 at F-1 was overplay because you could not kill the group. But eventually you did because your opponent crawled miserably at J-1 instead of cutting at J-3.
I hope that yourself would never play such kind of move. Crawling only helps you to kill the group. White has no chance to connect or make eyes this way.

Remember:
-Always Hane at the head of 2,3,4 stones (and don't let hane).

- Avoid Raw peeps. It means that if you have a chance to cut latter, you must not help your opponent by making him connect now.

-This concept has wider application:  If you have a chance to kill latter, you must not help your opponent by making him alive now.
If you have a chance to invade latter, you must not help your opponent by giving him safe territory now.

If your opponent has a weakness, do not play close to it except for the severe cut, kill, or invasion when it become possible.

- And avoid those stupid thin moves that let your opponent torn your groups to pieces.

Yours, Sincerely,

Denis.])
