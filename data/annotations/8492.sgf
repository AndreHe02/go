C[Alex: Thanks for sending this interesting game for review.  I think the most important thing you need to learn is to judge which stones are weak and which ones are strong: when you should be attacking, and when you need to defend.  It takes a while to learn this sort of judgement: it's often useful to watch games played by stronger players, or study professional games (even if you don't understand every move, you will still benefit by seeing what sorts of shapes they make).

I've made a few comments throughout the game; I hope some of them are helpful!]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[ce];W[ee]LB[ed:a][dh:b]C[Alex: I don't recommend this move: it leaves a weak shape.  Instead, try either 'a' (E16) or something in the area of 'b' (D12)]
;B[ch]
(;W[dd]C[My mistake. It threatens nothing and lets black play k17 next at the right distance of my wall.

Alex: Right.  So it's better for you to play K17, or something near K17, yourself.  Another option is to close the corner with C16: see the variation.]
;B[jc];W[hc];B[nd];W[fq];B[cn];W[dr];B[cq];W[jp]LB[iq:a][hp:b]
C[Alex: This is too far away: there's space for black to invade at H3.  Instead you should play either 'a' (J3) or 'b' (H4).]
;B[og]
(;W[pi]C[I thought black whated the centre and a big corner with P13, so I wanted to attack with R14 and possibly R17 as follow ups, but Q11 was maby too far away?

Alex: "Attack" is the wrong word: black's stones are strong here.  But P13 was a mistake.  I think you should invade the corner now: see the variation.]
;B[qk]C[Alex: Look at black's three stones above (O16, Q16, P13): they are strong.  Look at black's single stone below (R9).  It's weak.  You should try to attack the weak stone.  Pause at this point and guess what white's next move should be.]
(;W[qf]LB[qm:a]C[I followed up as was the plan, but R13 was probably safer?

Alex: I'd prefer to play 'a' (R7) here.];B[qg];W[qc];B[qd]
(;W[rd]C[Alex: I think Q18 is better: see the variation.];B[re]
;W[rc];B[pb];W[rf];B[rg];W[qe];B[se];W[sf];B[ra];W[pc];B[oc]
(;W[pe]C[Alex: I think you can escape by playing P15 instead.  See the variation.]
;B[od]
(;W[pg]C[Alex: Yes, your variations are good.];B[ph];W[of]C[I thought ko was the best now, but where before did it go wrong? In other words: are my variations correct? Because there it seems I can get 2 eyes.

Alex: See previous comments.];B[ng];W[qh];B[pf]C[And its a multistep ko :-(]
;W[ob];B[nb];W[pg];B[oh];W[rh];B[pf]C[Alex: Actually, you can escape without fighting the ko.  See if you can guess the next move.]
(;W[pa]C[Alex: See variations.];B[qb];W[pg];B[fc]C[Not bigger than living in the corner, is it?]
;W[sg];B[fe];W[ff];B[hd];W[fd];B[gd];W[ge];B[gc];W[dg];B[cg]
;W[cd]C[Maybe not such a good move after all.

Alex: Right.];B[qn]C[Much bigger :-(]
(;W[nq]TR[rh][qh][pi][pp][qn][qk]C[Alex: Black's two stones are still inside white's sphere of influence, so they're weak: black is outnumbered four against two.  So you can attack more forcefully: see the variation.]
;B[rp];W[qq];B[rq];W[qj];B[rk];W[nf];B[je];W[mg];B[ok];W[oi]
TR[hq][lq]C[Alex: This is a small move: capturing black's four stones is worth only eight points.  There are still two big spaces at the bottom where black might invade (H3 or M3): you should defend one of those places.]
;B[on];W[nj];B[nk]
(;W[mj]C[Alex: instead of crawling, you should jump ahead (M10); compare move 36.]
;B[mk];W[lj];B[lk];W[jj];B[mn];W[mp];B[kk];W[kj]LB[jh:a]C[Alex: You can enclose more territory by playing at 'a' (K12) instead.]
;B[kn]C[I thought his wall wouldnt make much points, but am I mistaking?

Alex: No, you are correct.  But you are already a little bit behind after your earlier mistakes.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[dh];B[ck];W[dk];B[dl];W[el];B[dm];W[he]LB[if:a]
C[Alex: This is a good idea, but 'a' (J14) instead is a better way to enclose some territory.]
(;B[ie]C[Alex: This is a mistake by black: see the variation.]
;W[if];B[jf];W[ig];B[jg];W[jh];B[di];W[ei];B[ci];W[ek];B[hq]
;W[ir]C[Alex: Now  you understand why K4 was a mistake.];B[ho]
;W[fo];B[jo];W[kp];B[ip];W[gm]LB[fm:a]C[Alex: As you found out later, this shape is too thin.  You should play 'a' (F7) instead.]
;B[hr];W[jr];B[fn]C[Should have connected earlier? Of can I still save them?

Alex: No, I can't see a way to save them.];W[gn];B[go]
(;W[en];B[fp];W[eo];B[ep]C[Alex: Before you go on, try to estimate what the score should be: how many points for each side?]
;W[cf]C[Alex: My guess: white has 9 points at the top left corner, 25 in the centre, 24 on the right side (including prisoners), 16 at the bottom, plus komi, total approx 80

Black has 50 at the left (including prisoners around D2), 22 around O8, 30 at the top, total just over 100

So black is about 20 points ahead at this stage.];B[bf];W[df]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[lp];W[lo]C[Playing m3 would be too easy for black I think.

Alex: Good.  Black M4 was a mistake.];B[lq];W[ko];B[jn];W[lr]
LB[mo:a]C[Alex: Instead, 'a' (N5) is better.];B[mo]
(;W[ln]C[Alex: This moves takes away your own liberties, so that you end in gote because you have to defend.  Compare the variation.]

;B[qp];W[pq];B[lg]C[BV: I wanted to play M15 earlier, but didnt see a chance.

Alex: Your chance was at move 138.]
(;W[lh]C[Alex: The variation is better.];B[mf]
(;W[mh]C[Alex: It's better to capture the stones.  You end up taking them off anyway (move 190), so you lose a move by playing N12.]
;B[me]C[Hm. Maybe I should have gotten in there?

Alex: Yes you should.  No further comments, except at the very end.]
