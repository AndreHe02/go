C[Dear reviewer !

Here is a serious game I played against a KGS 1d player. I am around 1-2d as well.
I (white) was ahead very soon in the game, and played very softly from then. My opponent also has a very solid style, so I expect you'll see many slow moves from both of us. However, although black played very slow moves, I win by a small margin. Black is exactly the kind of player I have a hard time with. I'm good at punishing overplays, but lose when my opponents play solid.

Please show us some ideas of how we could have played faster moves. I don't really know what mistakes I did. I can see some slack moves, but no big mistake. Please help in that area.

Thanks a lot for your help (don't hesitate to send one of your games if you want us to review it :)

Alex: Pincer is the only move. Can choose yours, or A, or B, or even C]

(;W[qf]C[This move is was unsure of. It may be slow, but it gives life to my corner, and sort of strengthen my lone R11 stone. Any other idea ?

(;W[nf]C[Alex: Better to skip. Never peep, if you can cut -]
;B[of];W[ni];B[mg];W[lg]C[I wonder about this hane. I play it because I want to make sure black doesn't make an eye here.

C[This area doesn't look very interesting, mainly because black can S4 and increase his own territory while reducing mine. Maybe the O11 plan was not that good ?

Alex: Right side is still big. W is satisfied];W[ch]C[I considered B17 here, because black may have trouble finding 2 eyes if I deprive him of the corner.

Alex: Your 2-space extension is more common. Black's group has base already, so hard to attack it]
;B[cd];W[ck]C[didn't answer at D15 because black is already strong.

Alex: Yes, good idea];B[be];W[fq];B[cn];W[dr];B[cq];W[iq]C[Alex: W is leading]

It's an overplay, of course -];W[nh];B[mh]
(;W[nl];B[ri]C[Here I considered the very bad shaped move at R12. if black plays S12 then I capture the top. However, b can play elsewhere, so I didn't play it.]

White is leading again!];B[lq]C[that's damn slow !

Alex: Yes, but how to answer? B has very weak shape ...];W[cr]
;B[jg];W[jf];B[br];W[bp]LB[cl:A]C[Alex: Overplay.
This move works, if W has stone at A. Now W is weaker on the left, so it's risky]

Vincent, if you read this review, I suggest you to review more games played by aggressive players - Kato Masao and Yoo Changhyuk. Your Go is quite passive and I am sure, you can learn a lot from them.]
