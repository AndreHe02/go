AB[pd][dp]C[Hello and thank you for reviewing my game.  I lost by alot with two handicaps.  I think it was because I let white get too much of the bottom.  Can you tell me what i'm good at and what I need to work on?

Hello, this is your reviewer. If you have any questions at all about what I've said on the review, feel free to pm me on KGS (Flight).]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[cf]
(;B[fd];W[bd];B[ch]C[Bad move]
(;W[ef]C[White makes an even worse move.];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb]
;W[ck]C[This move does to white what c12 should have done to you, create two weak groups.]
;B[dg]C[You shouldn't peep at two stones that are at the 3rd and 5th line.]
;W[df]
(;B[eg]C[Bad, you are pushing from behind.];W[fg]
(;B[dj]C[You don't shoulder hit a weak stone];W[dk]
(;B[ej]C[Too slow]
(;W[ee]C[I think that was too passive for w. I would make a base for my stones at C6

This is a horrible move, it doesn't do anything for white, it doesn't even protect the cut; All it does is help you create territory, it probably was better to play c6 for white.]
;B[ed];W[hc]C[Wow, it's just 1 weak group after another is it?]

(;B[hd]C[Strengthening c9 with a shoulder hit, and now strengthening h17 with a direct cap? Very, very bad.]
;W[id]C[Would it have been better to extend out at H15?];B[gc]
C[You're trying to save about 5 points];W[he];B[gd];W[ie]C[White links up his two weak groups to form central influence, that is a double-whammy. By now, you have already used up your handicap.]
;B[ic]C[We get greedier and greedier don't we? This only strengthens white's top influence.]
;W[jc];B[hb];W[jb];B[kd]C[It's bad to peep at what could be a possible cut. By playing this move, all aji in that area has been erased.]
;W[jd];B[ke]C[I don't see what you're trying to accomplish with this move, the top is clearly an open skirt, and your position is too thin, it's easily going to be destroyed.]
;W[nd]C[Y];B[nc];W[mc]
(;B[md]C[You don't start a fight with weak groups.];W[oc];B[nb]
;W[ob];B[mb];W[od];B[lc];W[pe]C[I thought it would be a waste to save that lone starpoint stone, but I do think that I should have thought about the corner first.

The corner is huge, you should have given the priority to the corner, the l15 stones are easily sacrificeable.]
;B[qn];W[nq];B[rp];W[qq];B[qk];W[fq]C[This move shows why E9 should have been played eariler.]
;B[fp]C[You are pretty much trying to build influence towards a part with white stones on it, and you help your opponent build influence towards the most open side. Don't play josekis blindly!]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[eq];B[dq];W[dn]
(;B[do]C[Strengthens white group.];W[cn];B[bo];W[iq]C[Although not the optimal play for white, he has certainly took too much of the bottom. Notice though how his left side only has one eye.]

(;W[qh];B[ik];W[gl];B[gk]C[artboy598 [9k\]: your not much of a talker I see]
;W[nh]C[I think now that I should have reduced at around m4.  I think my move was passive.

Be that as it may, capturing those four white stones was gigantic, you secure two weak groups.]
;B[lh]C[sanchez [7k\]: k dices
artboy598 [9k\]: huh?

Spanish for "What did you say?"

Obviously, he's not much of a talker because he's Spanish =)

Anyhow, odd move, it accomplishes nothing, it takes little territory and doesn't really strengthen your groups or weaken any of whites.]
;W[lp]C[Too tight, white should play about one line higher]

What was my problem?  Also, can you give me a rough estimatimation of my rank.

     I don't have a clue :P

I don't do estimations by rank. Plus I dislike people who take someone all the way to the end of the game only to resign there because they lost by too much. It's a horrible practice, and it would be polite of you to stop.]
