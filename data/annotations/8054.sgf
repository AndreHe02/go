AB[pd][dp]C[yann07 [12k\]: slt, bp
kenson [14k\]: bonne partie];W[cd];B[pp];W[cn];B[co]C[there is no urgency to respond to this move
at this point in the game, the top left corner is the place to play
surely you have heard "corners, sides, center" .. in that order
in this position, the top left corner is unsettled and so is the biggest point on the board]
;W[dn]
(;B[fp]C[fyi, this does not close the corner, as I will show in the variation]
;W[cq]
(;B[dq];W[cp];B[cr];W[bo];B[do];W[br];B[bn];W[bp];B[dr];W[bm]
;B[nc]C[this is an unfortunate continuation for b
the stone at f4 is too close to b's wall
if we count from the third line, b has a 3 stone wall, which would make the ideal extension 4 spaces, at J3 or J4

also, O17 is not the biggest point on the board, E17 still is

This is deffinately something for you to learn from this game, "corners, side, center"]
;W[hq];B[hp]C[this is a mistake
if you touch a stone, you imediately make it stronger, as i'm sure we are about to see

the best way to respond to an invasion like this is with a pincer

squeeze the w stone against your strong b wall and build territory on the bottom R and far R side]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[jq];B[jp]C[i would consider playing this move one line higher at k5, if at all
keep in mind that you are pushing from behind at this point, which should be avoided if possible]
;W[kp];B[iq];W[ir];B[ip];W[kq];B[nq];W[mq];B[np]C[attach, hane

don't be afraid, this w group is weak, hane at n4];W[mp];B[mo]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[rq];W[nr];B[or];W[mr];B[oq];W[qf];B[qe]
;W[pf];B[re]C[seccond line moves are yose (endgame).  save them for the endgame
this stone would be better spent at R11 or R12];W[rf]
(;B[jd];W[qj]C[w has made an ideal extension from his wall
you now have a wall at the bottom, R4, with no extension
extending from a wall is very big, and in this case it would serve the double function of attacking the w stones at r14
I'll show an alternate line to demonstrate];B[ql]C[so b gets another cramped extension with little chance of making territory on the grand scale]
;W[ld];B[lc];W[kc];B[kd];W[mc];B[lb];W[nd];B[mb];W[md];B[oc]
C[a fine exchange, exactly as it should have been played];W[oe]
;B[jc]C[noooo!
that is only 1 little stone, don't waste moves capturing one little stone
that stone should be swallowed up on a grand scale
the propper move in this position, and i'm cringing that it hasn't been played yet, is still at e17]

;W[cc];B[bc];W[gc];B[ed];W[ec];B[cb];W[db];B[ca]C[this is typical of double digit kyus
d19 is now a forcing move in sente
better for b to just play b18

(;B[nl]C[again, don't touch weak stones
this is another very big lesson to be learned from this game
instead of doing this, which seems to be your reaction, try to swallow the stone up on a grand scale]
;W[ml]C[when you touch a stone, this is what happens, every time, it immediately gets stronger
don't force your opponent to make his weak stones strong, let him play those moves in gote if he is going to]
