C[Hi

My name is Dieter Verhofstadt. I am 2 dan in Belgium and also 2 dan on KGS. I've stopped competitive play but I offer regular reviews.

In this review I will try to answer your questions while also pointing to the aspects I think are relevant. My comments will be preceded with (dv), unless in variations which I created.

"var" means a variation for the commented move

Feel free to reply if questions remain.];B[pd]C[Quacktapus [3k\]: hi gg
nickel [3k\]: hi];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]C[dv: Your question "In general, how should White play in the opening, since Black has the initiative" can be extended with "How should Black play in the opening, since White has komi?" I think indeed there is a fundamental difference in approach: Black must overcome komi by building large territories, or killing big groups. So Black will usually go for a large sphere of influence, which he can either convert or use to kill a group. White on the other hand, is happy if there is no territory on the board: komi then prevails. This may inspire White to obstruct the creation of big spheres of influence. You can say that Black should play "positive" and White "negative". However, every game is different and the position may call for building instead of obstructing.

I don't think either player should be preoccupied with "a color's style" and focus on the characteristics of the particular game instead. Remaining flexible is good. Your choice for 2 hoshis is very flexible.]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[po];B[qo]
(;W[qn]C[Would an avalanche joseki have been better here? I'm always hesitant to start that because it can get so complicated...

dv: Basically it is a choice between right side influence and bottom side influence, so between negating Black's top right hoshi, or building your own bottom left hoshi. I cannot tell which is better here. I fully support your choice for the most natural choice technically, the outside hane. And the negation of big moyos is coherent with White's natural style ...

Incidentally, with the avalanche, Black gets to choose the sides, see the most basic small avalanche in the var.]
;B[qp];W[pn];B[mq]C[This isn't joseki, though the difference is probably negligible. How should white deal with that?

dv: see var for next move]
(;W[qj]LB[qh:A][oj:B]C[Would 4th line be better here?

dv: Stabilizing these stones by making a base on the third line is the natural thing to do. If on the 4th line, Black A next is not as easy to respond to. Now, the natural response is B. You can try 4th line though ...]
;B[cn]
(;W[cl]LB[kq:A]C[dv: Normally I wouldn't discuss the opening too much, but since you've asked for it: I think that this choice makes it difficult for you to exploit the weakness Black left at A, the one from the earlier variation.See var.]
;B[en];W[fp]C[when I played this I was thinking that the fourth line would put more pressure on black's group. But then I didn't know how to respond...

dv: Maybe it was indeed better to stabilize here at the 3rd line.]
;B[hq]TR[dp][fp]SQ[cn][en]C[...when black played here.

dv: Black plays with a handicap mindset. He's bluffing you into submission. If you compare the marked stones, yours are stronger because they have more potential for eyes in the corner. His are weak since they have no base. So if you keep them separated, you have the advantage.]
(;W[cq]C[I felt really bad playing this because it looks so submissive but I couldn't figgure out where would be better to go. If the group at C6 got into the corner I would have no base and that group would, which would make it no longer vulnerable to attack.

dv: but that group cannot go both in the corner and make a base; you would separate these stones. See var.]
;B[go]C[And so this happens. Clearly bad for white, but again, I'm not sure how else I should have played.

dv: I think the answer was staring you in the face: you should play where he hurt you by shutting you into the corner. Maybe you could reassess the real risk of the opponent coming into your corner. It is not always that bad. Actually a corner invasion is often what you want your opponent to do to become strong yourself. This is the essence of an opening at 4-4: the invitation to invade at 3-3 and strengthen yourself in the process.]
;W[fn]LB[fo:A]C[trying to break out...

dv: Yes. Actually, Black surrounded your group after you made it alive by playing the corner. So cutting now is a good and agressive way to respond. Technically I'd have cut at A.]
;B[fo];W[eo];B[do]C[and it doesn't work];W[ep];B[fm];W[gp]
(;B[gn]C[If he hadn't let me out here it probably would have been game over really quickly

dv: Yes, probably. See var.];W[hp];B[iq];W[ip];B[jp];W[in]TR[cl]
SQ[cq]C[dv: We can here see how the marked white moves were inconsistent. The triangled move said "I am going to pressure you" but then the squared move said "I feel pressured". The result is that Black is strong and not pressured, while White has an insignificant corner.

If you want to avoid this situation, you must change the mentality with which you play the squared move.

I think this is the main message you can carry from this commented game.]
;B[jo];W[hn];B[hm];W[im];B[hl];W[ci]SQ[jo]C[I was soooo happy he let me have this move. I wanted to play it earlier, but I wanted to make sure his groups couldn't hem me in and connect.

dv: Agree. Black's marked move turned into gote. Now his strength has not much influence.]
;B[ch]C[I didn't end up handling this well. How should white respond?]
(;W[bh]C[dv: The hane is the basic answer, but Black can use crosscut tactics to cut of a piece. See var.

Even then, there are many occasions where you can dodge his tactics. See the continuation for such alternatives.]
;B[bi]
(;W[bj]C[dv: This is the first place where White can dodge. See var.]
;B[bg]
(;W[ai]C[dv: Although harder at this point, White can still dodge the large scale cut. See var.]
;B[cg];W[ef];B[eh]SQ[cl]C[dv: Black is happy because you are cut on a large scale.

Essentially, your mistake is that you payed too much attention to the stone close to his thickness. It helps to always be reminded of "staying away from thickness", in order to find better tactics.]
;W[ej]C[trying to attack something...];B[bf];W[cb];B[eb]
(;W[ce]C[is this too slow? should white just jump out?

dv: As it affects both groups' base, it looks good. But see var.]
;B[gh]C[dv Being cut on a large scale feels bad. You have no advantage in territory, so you are definitely behind now.]
;W[gj];B[ge];W[fd];B[gd];W[be];B[fg]C[dv: Black connects and encloses. This will prove to be a winning strategy.]
;W[qf]C[I really really hoped the top white group was alive. It doesn't end up dying, but is there a way it can be killed?

dv: Looks hard to me. See var on next move.]
(;B[qi]C[dv: Oops he did it again. This emergency technique is generally not good. Black removes his liberties right away.]
;W[pj];B[pi];W[oi];B[pg];W[qc]C[dv: Good thinking.];B[qd];W[pc]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nf]
LB[nj:A]C[dv: It's tempting when you have forced an opponent into an overconcentrated position, to continue on that road. But this is an overplay. 

Protecting the big cut at A is best;];B[ng]LB[oj:A]C[dv: Black should cut at A.]
;W[rf];B[pf];W[se];B[oe]C[dv: But I'll grant you that: he's overconcentrated bigtime!]
;W[mo]C[dv: I like this move. You are catching up.];B[ri];W[lq]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[kq];W[mr];B[nr]
(;W[no]C[dv: See var.];B[lr];W[nq];B[ms];W[np];B[mr];W[ln]C[dv: Anyway a major reduction.]

;B[ro];W[oq];B[or];W[pp];B[qr];W[rj];B[sj]LB[ih:C][ji:B][nj:A]
[dm:D]C[dv: difficult choices here.]
(;W[qk];B[nj]C[dv: With hindsight, this may have been decisive. I would not have thought this to be so big, but if you look at what happened afterwards, this play on the border of territories is huge.]
;W[nk];B[mk];W[rl]LB[dm:A]C[so here I figgured I wasn't going to get much territory from this area anyway, so I tried to just make it secure so I could tenuki...

dv: Yes, but it seems White's prospects for territory are not enough now. Only an attack on the left group, starting at A, may be enough, but I don't think it will succeed.]
;B[nl];W[sk];B[si]C[dv: Funny Black worries about this stone.]
;W[jh];B[kg];W[ig];B[jf];W[if];B[ie];W[gk];B[gl];W[kh];B[ok]
;W[mb];B[lb];W[ma]LB[dm:C][bo:B][gr:A]C[dv: This is very small endgame. The middle game is not over.]
;B[kc]C[dv: Strangely, Black believes it.];W[ff];B[gf];W[dg]
;B[dh];W[ek];B[fl];W[co];B[dn];W[gr]C[dv: Impressive sequence!]
;B[gq];W[fq];B[bo];W[bp];B[hr];W[fr];B[dl];W[dk];B[bm];W[bl]
;B[ap];W[aq];B[ao];W[am];B[cp];W[bq];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[bd]
LB[ce:B][nf:C][cq:A]C[big mistake as I realized after the next play...

dv: Yes, loss of sente.

With all groups stable, there is a clear territorial afvantage for Black and no point in making further comments.

I believe the comments made at A, B and C are most important. Not coincidently, they are about the middle game, about connecting and cutting, about enclosing and escaping. I think these concepts prevail over the more subtle aspects of the opening, at least for us amateurs.

Good luck!
