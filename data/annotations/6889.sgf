proper move is at b4];W[bq];B[fq];W[er];B[fr];W[cr];B[gp]C[Is the result at left bottom cornor acceptable for both B and W?]

(;W[nc];B[qf];W[jd]
(;B[jq]C[this move is strange
better to seal in W i think

or...at the very least...use better spacing on bottom (see 2nd variation)]

(;B[qi]C[Is there a better move to help Q9 and the right top corner?

YES!];W[ce];B[cj]TR[ch][dn]SQ[mn]C[this move is odd.  it encourages w to play d6 area as well as d12 area and make double-wing formation in top left.  maybe you're thinking of them as something like miai...i guess i'll see how it plays out.

the squared point is also getting to be quite large.];W[mn]
;B[co];W[bo];B[do];W[dr]
(;B[bn];W[lq]TR[qc][pj][bm]C[hmmm....w seems to be gaining momentum and b has left lots of weaknesses behind (open top right corner, b7 connection, q10 cut, etc).]
;B[rq]
(;W[qp]C[bad move for w
instead. w should just develop outside thickness];B[lp];W[kq]

(;B[mq];W[kp];B[lo]C[this way of playing would be more effecting if m5 significantly weakens w's right group.]

C[It took me quite long time to select a good point here, and get no answer indeed. Finally put K14 based on my basic feeling. What should be kept in mind when handling this kind of situations?

k14 is both aimless and very complex.  I'm not sure how it will play out.  but...first i will say that this type of move kills a lot of aji at the top (remember you don't want w to solidify the top becaue you have several invasion points).  Furthermore, it starts to attack the k10 group but it seems like it is too far and k10 will have an easy time due to a lack of pressure.]
;W[hd]
(;B[ld]C[this move is bad idea.  if you really want to do something over here, why not q18?]

(;B[dd]C[not sure what you're thinking

a much better idea is in the variation.];W[cd];B[cc]C[overplay?]
;W[ec];B[ee];W[bc]TR[dd][ee]C[bad shape...and now the d16 cutting stone is useless]
;B[cb];W[bb];B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[gc];B[ge];W[fb];B[fe]C[I think the result at the left top corner is a fail to Black. Actually if white continue moves at c13 or c12, black gains nothing here. How to handle it better?
