C[Dear reviewer,

I played B in this game and won thanks to a mere 0.5 komi.  I
think B had a better opening position across the board than W.
But somehow there didn't seem to be any way for B to attack W's
weak group in the center.  Please give some advice on how B could've
played more effectively in the middle game (or in any other part
of the game, of course).  Since the result was so close, it'd
be nice to have some comments on the endgame as well.

Thanks for reviewing the game!

Best,
Ken];B[pd];W[dp];B[ce];W[qp]C[The professional fuseki database of MFGO, v.10 has one game with
this position - B's next move was D17.];B[op];W[mq];B[qq];W[pq]

C[A little error in the joseki order.  Is there anything W could
do to punish B, or does it make no difference?

N: I think the punishment is B loses sente - you should just
play at A right away.];W[mp];B[qo];W[mr]TR[mp]C[This move is unnecessary after W connects at N4 and thus W gives
sente away.];B[cn];W[fp]C[I know it is early (especially for an amateur game) but even
at this stage, I like B better - he has stones all over the board
while all of W's stones are on one side.];B[bp];W[cq];B[dl]
LB[oo:a]C[Is it too risky for B to ignore the cut at a (P5)?  On the other
hand, was quite happy to play B21-25, which work rather well
with B3.

N: I don't think so - it's give and take. See variation of W's
next move.]
(;W[dc]LB[ed:a]C[Seems to be a mistake?  E16 would be a better choice?

N: I totally agree with you except...];B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[gc]
;B[gd];W[hc]
(;B[ci]TR[ci][dl][cn][bp]SQ[ce][ed][fd][gd]C[...I would have kept pressing down at H16.  I don't think the
marked stones are working at maximum efficiency.  See vars.]
;W[cd];B[bd]C[Better to simply extend to B15?

N: Perhaps, but if it's a mistake, it's not that big.];W[dd]
;B[de];W[bc]C[Quite satisfied with this result starting with W26 (D17).]
;B[pj]C[N: Perhaps it's my style, but I would have preferred to press
at H16.  Q10 is still a big point, however.];W[hd]LB[nc:A]C[A nice, thick move which limits B's left side and also aims at
a point around A.];B[ff]LB[nc:A][gf:B]TR[ci]C[Too conservative?

N: I don't like this move - it makes C11 even less effective
(or some may say a bad move).

I'd prefer A.

Locally, B looks better.];W[ei]C[Nice reducing move.]
(;B[lc]CR[ff][hd]C[This seems more important than to respond to E12, especially
after the H16-F14 exchange.  Correct?

N: W's move at E11 really makes B F14 look bad.

B 43 looks a little stretched - I'd extend as far as N17.

Another idea is for B to cap at G11 to try and seize control
of the game.  See var.];W[cj]TR[ci]C[Now B C11 doesn't look that good either.]

(;B[di]C[Still, a bit worried about top B group, so didn't play the D10
hane (see variation).

N: See my comments to your var.];W[dj];B[ej];W[ek];B[fj];W[dk]

(;B[cm]C[If instead of C7, B move at B7 would seem to lead to a thick
W wall outside.  Didn't want to see that happen.

N: I'm not sure I agree, see var.];W[el];B[dm];W[bl];B[fn];W[gl]

(;B[hn]C[I think you missed an opportunity for a leaning attack at H5,
or more agressively, G4.  See vars.];W[hp];B[im]C[Not sure about this.  J8 felt a bit too risky, given B group's
own lack of eye space, so was trying to keep a clear path to
the center.  B65 also allows for possible reduction of W bottom.
Any better alternatives?

N: See my comments about the leaning attack.];W[gj]C[Nice.  Was expecting W J8...]

(;W[gr];B[mo]LB[kl:A]C[Still worried about P5 cut, and connection to the left-side group.

N:You're worrying about something too small at this stage. see
var. if W cuts at move 78 instead.

Another idea is playing at A which is both offensive and defensive.]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[fk]LB[qd:A]TR[fi][fj][ej]C[At this point W's group is virtually unkillable and there's not
much potential in harassing it.  So a different strategy is to
let W capture the marked stones and for you to take a large point
elsewhere such as A.  Give and take.];B[ei]LB[gh:a]C[Felt this was not intolerable, with G12 cut left.

N: The cut at G12 is very small.];W[bm];B[bn]LB[qd:A]C[N: I think this is too small.  A move like A is bigger.  I still
think B is winning quite comfortably.];W[qf]
(;B[qh]LB[qd:A][rd:B][qe:C]C[Was this a good choice?

N: I like A or B better.  B R12 ends up being too close to the
thickness.

You might even attach at C.];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re]
;W[rc];B[qe]TR[qh]C[B R12 looks too close to the thickness.]
;W[nc];B[oc]LB[nd:A]C[Not necessary - O16 is the better move.]
;W[ob];B[nd];W[nb];B[le]C[This move is secure but may have not been needed if you kept
pressing at O16 as already mentioned.

However, at this point of the game, B is still clearly ahead.]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[oj]C[Nonplussed by this move...]
(;B[oi]C[Decided to hane on this side since the ladder from P9 is favorable
to B.  Didn't want to simply extend, since that'd likely give
W quite a bit of points in the center.  Better alternatives?

N: It is very difficult for W to make points in the center right
now and I'm sure he wasn't thinking that when he made this move.

(;B[jf]LB[jg:A]C[To prevent W forming anything significant in the center.

N: A looks possible, see var. for one possibility.];W[jh];B[jb]
C[
N: Unfortunately, the endgame is where I'm weakest.  I still
think B is winning at this point so playing safe and getting
to his equal share of large points should mean victory.];W[ib]

C[At this point, I think B has a solid lead, so no further comments
made.

The game was closer than it was because of your mistake at move
205.

Your opening was better and you kept your lead (for the most
part), throughout the game.  You did not make any mistakes (up
to move 143) that cost you the game.];W[kh];B[mm]LB[oo:b][lm:a]

that'd naturally allow B to fix the aji at b (P5).  But, again,
