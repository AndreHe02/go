AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[[HKO\] Hi, I'm Hanamiko and I will be commenting this game, my comments will be following this tag: [HKO\]
In general you both played well in this game, 
A few comments which apply to various part of the game:
- keep connected: b should use all of her chances to connect your stones and create strong groups. When you'll be higher level you will worrie about keeping your groups light but for the moment just try to connect solidly and threaten your opponent with powerfull groups, avoid diagonal connections when possible, I will explain better during the game

- shapes: check out which shapes are good and which are bad (for example the empty triangle you did several times in this match). even if you do not understand why try to play out good ones and avoid bad ones if you can, slowly you'll understand theyr power

- checking the whole board: several times both w and b kept playing in one area without considering that there was a much more important point elsewhere]
PL[W];W[qo]C[augentier [23k\]: hi gl gg^^
[HKO\]this is a terible move to start with. You should have played far away fr
on the enemy stones. The bottom side is emptier and, if you want ot play on th
e right side you should definitely play one line up.];B[qp]
C[[HKO\] Can you see how strong the black position looks?];W[rp]
;B[ql]C[[HKO\] I think that black was too aggressive here, he should have definitely
played S3 to defend the corner, maybe black was thinking about making white live small in the cor
ner?];W[qq];B[pq];W[qr];B[pr]C[[HKO\]];W[jp]C[[HKO\] the corner is not yet settled, but white has got some strength there and is trying to explore the bottom area]
;B[gp]C[[HKO\]: you still have quite a strong wall  in Q2-4, you can use it to threaten teh white stone in K4, you could play this 1 line lower to be more aggressive and threaten to slide under white stone in K4 or (better) at Q5 to prevent any connection between the white's corner and the K4 stone]
;W[hq];B[gq]C[[Hko\] this diagonal attachments givve you 2 powerful groups in contact with white stones, you have to use them to attack white]
;W[mp];B[jj]C[I think white did a good job of taking over the bottom corner. What could
/should I have done?

[HKO\] big mistake! not yet! w didnt' win the bottom yet, you have two walls at Q2-4 annd G3-4 that are ready as bases to attack the 3 white stones in the bottom can still do a huge number of
 things to the poor three white stones. First you need to secure Q5 (as the white continuation showed), it is a big point, and after that you can  take out white eyespace at N2 for example]
;W[po]C[[HKO\]this is a good move by white, but black should have played here earlier]
;B[oo]C['];W[op];B[np];W[oq]
(;B[mo]C[[HKO\] The group at Q2-4 is gone, but you can still re-build one at O2-4 if you keep chasing white (see variation)]
;W[or];B[lp];W[mq];B[ko];W[ps];B[pn]TR[ko][mo][oo][lp][np]C[Bad move... Should have played one lleft
[HKO\] Yes, in general, keep your stones strongly connected, diagonal connection is WEAK]
;W[on];B[no];W[nq];B[pm];W[jd]C[[HKO\] ok, white has got the right corner and lot of points there but you have some strenght with only a minor weak points]
;B[gd];W[hc];B[gc];W[gb];B[md]C[[HKO\] for the secon time you tried to pincer the white stones when they 
tried a Hane. why do you reply like this? you should definitely 
do F18 here];W[nc];B[pc];W[mi]C[too far away, and not enough support... K13 or K14 might have been better

[HKO\] yes, this stone is too far away and has no use in the current situation]
;B[mj]C[[HKO\] never defend the territory in the center, especially so early in the game when there are tich sides and corners to take (first corner then sides
 then center)];W[lg];B[jg];W[qi];B[pi];W[ph]
(;B[oi]C[[HKO\] I cannot understand the pourpose of this move so I cannot suggest 
an alternative. In general this shape (the empy triangle) is inefficient and should be avoided if there is a viable alternative. If you were aiming at disconnecting the two white groups what about P12? Can you read the short ladder resulting from white cutting? (see var)]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[nj];B[ni];W[lj];B[nk];W[oh];B[li];W[mh];B[ki]
;W[nj];B[oj]C[Should have connected at N9 instead of capturing.
[HKO\] yes, in general, especially in this high handicap games you should focus on keeping your stones connected solidly and opponent stones disconnected and scattered in small groups: most of the times this is enough to win. White is now trying to make your shape big and ugly (dango), but he didn't had success]
;W[mk];B[nj];W[lk];B[nh];W[ng];B[lh];W[ol]CR[mm]C[IDK... I think N7 might have been better.... white lost more with this pl
ay];B[om];W[pk];B[qk];W[rh];B[mg];W[kf];B[dm];W[mf];B[mh];W[pl]
;B[nl];W[ec];B[dc];W[db];B[og];W[nf];B[pg];W[qh];B[cb];W[cc]
C[Should have played at Q14 or connected at E18
[HKO\] white is in a desperate situation (there is probably a bit more handicap than needed in this match) so she is trying to complicate things in order to push your mistakes]
;B[eb];W[da];B[ca];W[fb];B[ea];W[bb];B[cd];W[bc];B[bd];W[ba]
;B[fc];W[ed];B[ee];W[ad];B[ae];W[ac];B[be];W[ch]C[Bad move - no support around...
[HKO\] yes, white doesn't have many chances here. Moreover the most urgent situation is on the top righ where nothing is settled yet: why did you stop playing there?]
;B[dh]C[I played on the D line to force white down
[HKO\] the idea is correct and it worked. Still try not to go for "contact play" you you are attacking ("don't attach when attacking"). With this move you give white the chance to strengthen herself extending or taking liberties out from your contact stone (like she did). I think 1 line right would have been even better]
;W[dg];B[di];W[ci];B[cj];W[bj];B[cg];W[cf];B[bg];W[bf];B[bi]
;W[ag];B[bh];W[ah];B[ai];W[df];B[eg];W[af]C[White shouldnt have played that...]
;B[ef];W[aj];B[bk];W[ck];B[dk];W[cl]C[Not much hope for those white stones]

;B[kg];W[lf];B[ig];W[hd];B[fa]C[[HKO\] this move is not usefull, do you see that your 5 stones in the top right are in danger? Let's help them!]
;W[hb];B[nd]C[[HKO\] good!];W[mc];B[oc]C[[HKO\] check on sensei library the empty triangle]
;W[ob];B[qg]C[Is the following analysis correct?

bad move for black - could have played from the other side - would have made a
 wall there that white might have responded to, and I'd have more outs to atta
ck from the top.

[KHO\] I do not understand where the "other side" is. Broadly speaking this move helps your 2 stones at P13 which is good.]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[pe]C[[HKO\] white recognized and played something similar to a very well known tesuji (a special tactic), why don't you learn it as well? it is called Crane's Nest Tesuji, cehck it on sensei library!]
;B[oe];W[of];B[pf]C[Terrible move - should have played at R14]
;W[qf]C[yep];B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[sf];B[pb];W[pa]C[Nope - should have played O18 or O19]
;B[nb];W[pg];B[pe];W[qa];B[oa];W[mb];B[na]C[Stupid play - leads to the sequence where white plays N19 in sente and bl
ack has to play P18
[HKO\]: yes, it is useless];W[ma];B[ob];W[ld]
(;B[qb]CR[ne]C[Should've played at circle to make an eye...
[HKO\] nope, this is a good move,  if you had played there white could try to 
connect her 2 stones Q19 with the S15 group, leaving you with only one eye, the one you would have created (see variation!)]
;W[ne];B[rd];W[me]C[[HKO\] there is no need to defend  this 2 stones, they are irrelevant
 for the rest of the board];B[od];W[sd];B[rc];W[sc];B[sb];W[ra]

(;B[oh];W[oi];B[ni]C[[HKO\] obviously w in a real game would not go on with the ladder...]

(;B[nq];W[or];B[nr];W[ps];B[no]C[[HKO\] now white's stones in the bottom side look really in danger!]
