C[Hello Reviewer!

Thank you very much for offering to review.  About the game:

Raine and I are old friends since 4th grade and we play a weekly game of go to stay in touch and to improve our games.  Our official KGS rankings are 11k and 14k.  The rankings may not be exactly right for us.  Regardless, even if he is 3 stones stronger than me, the day I give him stones is the day he takes my goban from my cold dead hands ;)

Anyways, the moral is since we're playing for mutual improvment, please try to make comments for both sides.

Hello my name is Yannick and I am currently 4k on IGS. I will prefix my comments with /Y]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]C[lc - I have been trying to play either Kobayashi or low chinese fuseki in my games when I take black.]
;W[cn];B[jp];W[nd]LB[qj:A][qk:B]C[lc - Raine hasn't really studied kobayashi.  The reasoning behind this move was to not play into the fuskei blindly.  Sorta an anti-kobayshi

/Y 
A possible alternative would be to play at A or B, as a stone there would be hardly attackable.]
;B[pf]
(;W[kd]LB[jc:A][jd:B]C[lc - Raine played here.  I think k16 is better.   He didn't like the cut at M16 after k16.  Is this too passive?

/Y
I think it is too slow yes. See the vars for alternatives.]
;B[df]C[lc - This was a point of great internal strife for me.  I have been told lately that I have been playing cowering moves, so this is an attempt to be strong.  I think R9 would have been better.

/Y
R9 is probably more consistent with your initial strategy, and also with your Q14 play. Plays on the 4th line are meant for development, while plays on the 3rd line are more solid but less useful for building influence (in general).]
;W[dj]LB[fd:A]C[lc - Raine felt this may have been too defensive

/Y
I'd like to refer to the comment on the previous move. It would be better for Wh to play on the opposite direction (around A), since Wh has played at C6 on the 3rd line. The two Wh stones D4 and C6 have little potential for development. On the other hand, the upper side can be turned in a moyo by Wh.]
;B[fd];W[ee];B[cc];W[pn]C[lc - I was really surprised Raine moved here and didn't play the joseki at C16.  He said that the move was move wasn't urgent.  How do you feel about this?

lc - As far as Q6, I maintain that R6 is better.

/Y
I agree that a Wh answer is not urgent, however since Wh played a quite light move at Q6, Bl does not necessarily have to answer either and can take an advantage in the upper left corner by threatening to remove the life-base of the two Wh stones]

(;B[pk]LB[qj:A][qk:B]C[lc - I felt a pincer was strong, but in retrospect I think the pincer at Q8 is better since it allows for the shapely move at R11 afterwards.

/Y
What is nice about this pincer is that it acts also as an extension from the two Bl stones in the upper-right corner. A pincer at Q8 would not serve this purpose as well. Pincers on the 3rd line at A or B would be just as nice I think.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[qq];B[po];W[qp];B[oq];W[oo]C[lc - Raine played here, but maybe R5 atari is better?]
;B[no];W[on];B[nf]LB[cd:B][fo:A]C[lc - Another point of great internal strife.  In retrospect a complete mistake.  I think its both the wrong idea and the wrong spot.  If this direction maybe O15 is better.  Perhaps a play at the top is better?


/Y
I don't think this is a mistake, you're trying to enlarge your influence. I think O14 is better than O15. A or B are also possible I think.]
;W[hd]
(;B[dc]LB[nk:A]C[
/Y
Here I would have taken the opportunity to develop the Bl framework even more by playing at A.]
;W[fe];B[cd];W[nk]
(;B[pi]C[
/Y
I find this move a bit flat, see variation for a better alternative]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[of];B[og];W[ng]
(;B[nh]C[
/Y
I think this atari is not good. See var];W[mg];B[mh];W[nc]LB[lg:A]
C[lc - I think this is too territorial minded for white.  Could white play somewhere entirely?

/Y
I think Wh should play at A to avoid having his moyo greatly reduced.
See var for what happens if Bl plays at A]
(;B[fo];W[dq]
(;B[dh]LB[nn:A]C[lc - During the game I thought this was a good way to pressure a reduction on the side near D8.  In review I think C11 might be better.

/Y
I think a much better strategy would be to try to enlarge even more your moyo at the bottom by playing at A. Wh has to answer this.]
;W[cj];B[dl];W[cl];B[dm]LB[lg:A][qm:C][nn:B]C[lc - I'm not sure this is at all sente or good.  Alternatives?

/Y
It depends on what you thought while playing this. If you were trying to invade Wh territory it is not a good strategy I think, because it is quite small

If you were trying to enlarge your moyo at the bottom, it is good, but play at A then B before.]

/Y
Here Bl is beeing too nice with Wh I think.];W[pl]
(;B[mk]LB[mn:A]C[
/Y
I don't understand the purpose of this move. A would be much better because it would prevent Wh from entering the Bl moyo.]
;W[mm];B[ml];W[mn];B[km];W[fm];B[fl]C[lc - I'm still not convinced this can go unpunished.]
;W[fj];B[ic]LB[gm:A]C[lc - The wrong idea?

/Y
Since you tried to save your two stones D7, maybe it's better to play at A ?]
;W[id];B[hc];W[jc];B[gd];W[ge];B[gm]LB[ec:A]C[/Y
Bl should add a move in the upper left corner because Wh can cut Bl by playing at A]

(;W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[fn];W[cg]C[lc - Nice move...];B[ch];W[dg]
;B[eg];W[cf];B[de];W[ce];B[ef];W[bh];B[bi]C[/Y
Bl is trying to capture a group and that will lead to disaster because of the cut at E12]
;W[bg];B[ci];W[eh];B[ei]C[lc -I played this, but it was just a nervous move.  I think running the E13 group out and attacking the cutting points would be better.]

;W[ji];B[hi];W[gj];B[ki]LB[hh:A]C[lc - Knights move connection and a contact play.  Maybe too aggressive?

/Y 
Bl can capture the J11 Wh stones by playing A. As it is now, Wh can capture the H11 stone, therefore the two J11 Wh stones are not really in danger.]
