;B[qe];W[pf];B[oc]C[W10. Excruciatingly bad!

B13. Why?? Lets W off the hook. Continuing again at R14 is much better.]
;W[qf];B[nd]C[NM: Was O16 necessary? It seemed to me that he could split me with Q17, so some defence was worthwhile.



Definitely necessary.];W[qk]C[W16. Another mistake. One space too far!]
;B[fc]C[B17. You might have considered R7 here to see how W responds, aiming at either closing the corner or invading at R11.]
;W[df];B[id];W[qp];B[pn]C[B21. An interesting idea, but better at R3.];W
[qn];B[qm]C[NM: Maybe I should have taken R3 here?



Absolutely not! The text is best, and consistent with the intent of B21.]
;W[po];B[oo]C[B25. Unfortunately necessary.];W[pm];B[on];W[rm];B[qq];W[rq]
C[B29. Territorially large, but pure Gote. Was that your intent here? If so,  simply playing B21 at R3 would have been far better.]
;B[ro]C[B31. Aji Keshi! Since this doesn't work directly, it should be saved for  use as a Ko threat.]
;W[qo];B[pq];W[je]C[W34. Preparing to invade at the bottom, but not only premature but not really necessary.]
;B[ie]C[B35. Not bad but at K16 would seem more natural, giving B a large, almost secure territory above while W has essentially nothing to show for W34.]
;W[jq]C[W36. Not the best invasion point. At H3 is clearly better, but neither is really necessary yet. Instead, C10 looks reasonable as a big fuseki point.]
;B[iq];W[kq]C[W38. A bit slow and heavy. The cross cut at J4 gives B more problems.]
;B[ir]C[B39. Nothing wrong with L4 to force W to live small on the edge.]
;W[kp];B[mr]C[NM: Could I actually have killed the W group? I doubted it.



B41. Very bad!!! Not only too low (N3 is better but still wrong), but inconsistent with B39. Instead L6 is called for, to block W's egress and force him against the B thickness on the right. The text makes it easy for W.]
;W[jo];B[ip];W[kn];B[lo];W[ko];B[hn]C[B47. If you're looking toward a later invasion on the right, at L8 now is better. The text is O.K. if B's interest is now on the left.]
;W[ln]C[W48. Bad! Too slow. W must immediately jump out to K8 or L8.];B
[rr]C[B49. A useful interpolation for asuring B's life, but just consider now how much better off B would be if he had held B31 back for later use as a Ko threat!]
;W[rp];B[mo]C[B49 was O.K., but B51 is awful! B is already sure of life here, so attack or tenuki is called for!Besides, capturing B45 is far too slow for W to even think about now so B will almost surely be able to get back to play here later if necessary.]
;W[lk];B[om]C[B53. another move probably left unplayed for now.];W[pl];B
[nk];W[kj];B[qh]C[NM: Was this too agressive?



Should I have reinforced my Top side first?



(I didn't see any very convincing way to do so)



Neither! Now is the time to begin operations on the left side! With B5 now backed up by a wall of steel, stealing the corner at C3 now is very big, as are a host of other moves there.]
;W[rg]C[W58. Terrible! Unnecessarily submissive. Either P12 or even N14 are much better.]
;B[dr]C[NM: I wanted to make sure of the safety of my F3 group, while taking a bit of territory, before starting to push the W K3 group in such a way that the F3 group might be cut off.



a. F3 group already safe.

b.You're obsessing! Build up strength via attacking elsewhere and then get back to the W center group if that's still feasible/desirable!]
;W[er];B[eq];W[cr];B[dq];W[cq];B[cp]C[NM: I decided to sacrifice two stones to close off in sente.



(though later I should have taken B2)



(In fact I'm not sure it was necessary, as

simply C1 was probably  sente.)



Neither! You already have Sente!!];W[co];B[bp];W[bo];B[cs];W[bq];B[ri]C
[B71. What's this???  Too low, too slow, and looking for trouble! If you're still aiming at the center W group, then perhaps O13 now at least makes some sense, but the left side is still where the action should be now.]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[ok];B[ml]C[B75. If you're going to do any of this now, at least atari first at P10 to help B57,71!]
;W[nj];B[mk];W[mj]C[W78. Now, with your bad play you've essentially succeeded in ending any threats you should have had against the overextended W upper right side group, as well as his center stones as well! But at least you emerge with Sente.]
;B[oj]C[B79. Obsessive! More Aji Keshi.];W[pk];B[ng];W[nf]C[W82. Playing simply at P13 or even Q12 are far safer, and more than good enough.]
;B[mf];W[ne]C[NM: I was tempted to play N15 and let R12 etc. get cut off, but I thought that with two weak W groups I should continue the attack.



W84. Now W is in trouble! P13 is called for.];B[og];W[me];B[lg];W[kf]C[



 Niall 5k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[li];W[lj];B[jh];W[if];B[jg];W[jf];B
[oi]C[B95. Good! Not only saves B79 but makes shape at the same time. Now B is (or should be) safely ahead.]
;W[mm];B[nm];W[ll];B[nl];W[ij]C[W100. Induces B to continue splitting W's two weak groups. Instead, J7 avoids that dangerous scenario.]
;B[hh];W[hf]C[W102. Painfully slow. Instead, W could try G14, and if B unwisely cuts there is too much bad Aji above for W to exploit for B to emerge unscathed.]
;B[ld]C[B103. Leaves too many holes. At L17 is far safer.];W[le];B[ff]C
[B105. Too ambitious, but potentially good if it induces a W error. Does B have a clearly defined objective here? If we assume the proverb that "big groups never die" then this attack must have some other objective if it is to be productive!]
;W[gg]C[W106. Passive, and plays into Black's hands and  justifies his strategy. Instead, W should atari at N16, then at M17, and if B100 tries to escape he forces, then has things like F16 etc. to make life, all without damaging the still weak center group.]
;B[gh];W[fg];B[hk];W[hj];B[gj];W[gi];B[fi]C[B113. Simplistic. Extending at F12 instead threatens to continue with E13, and from the foregoing moves it's clear that W fears that.]
;W[gk];B[hi];W[hl]C[NM: I was aware that my Top was thin, but D10 seemed to me a very big point.]
;B[dj]C[B117. In any event, atari first at F9!

But there's no rush to play at D10. With your strength nearby and the upper left 3-3 point still open, W can't make much territory on the left side (if you play correctly!).]
;W[jd];B[db];W[cb]C[



 spv 5k*: if you think the way you ruined all my nice territory has put me in a good mood, think again. <g>]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[ed];W[de];B[ef]C[B125. at L17 is clearly bigger.];W[eg]C
[W126. Now this is no longer necessary because W can easily live on the upper side, while ruining B's territory there.]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[dg]C[NM: D13 was too hopeful!



B129. A completely unnecessary overplay. At L18 is BIG. From here on is where you went wrong on a major scale! If you want to atack here, just slide to C12 to induce a W connection (if he falls for it), then slide to C8, and the game is in the bag!!!!]
;W[dh];B[cg];W[ch]C[



 Niall 5k*: I can assure you, that thought had not occurred to me :-)))



 Niall 5k*: (but it might have put ME in a good mood....)];B[ca];W[cf];B
[bb];W[bc]C[NM: Now at this point I thought I was about 5 points ahead.  Was I right?



More than that by my estimate.];B[jm]C[NM: Maybe K7 was a bit too agressive too.

B137. Trying to accomplish the impossible. Better just atari at F9, then slide to C8.]
;W[im]C[



 Niall 5k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[jk];W[ik];B[fk]C[B141. But now this is gote instead of sente! A BIG loss!]
;W[fl];B[el]C[



 spv 5k*: sorry, but that's all the rape and pillage I can tolerate for one game. <g>



 spv 5k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[ib];B[hb]C[



 Niall 5k*: what me - rape and pillage?];W[jb];B[gc]C[B147. At G15 holds better.]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[he];B[hc];W[fa];B[ga];W[ii]C[W154. Cedes Sente for nothing.]
;B[hg];W[gf]C[NM: Should I have taken say B10 now?



C8 is the key point, but because of the W atari at E9 B must play instead at D8. Then B can either make territory in the lower left via E4 followed by E6 (because of the potential atari at F7), or can ruin W's on the left side.]
;B[fm];W[ck];B[cj];W[bj];B[bl]C[B161. Not good. Instead, B11, W connect, B connect threatens to save B129,131, so is sente. Then B can follow with E4 and E6 to make a large lower left.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[bk];B[dm];W[bm];B[bn];W[al]C[B167. since you can't afford to follow this up immediately, it's better left behind as Aji.]
;B[rk]C[B169. The E4, E6 combination is much bigger.];W[rl];B[qj]C[W172. Now, as with many moves before, Q16 is worth 1 point with Sente.]
;W[sk];B[pd]C[B173. E4, E6 is still better, as is the simple conection at S10.]
;W[rj];B[oe];W[of];B[gl]C[B177. The E4, E6 combination is better.];W[jl]
C[W178. Unnecessary. J6 is better.];B[mn]C[NM: This was surely not the largest yose point! If I take B2 and then say M18, would I win?  My calculation suggests not.



B179. the text is clearly very small!

As for what would win here I can't say, but you've already missed so many key plays that what happens now is almost irrelevant!

certainly teh e4, E6 combination still cries out to be played, and even C6 is better than the text.]

 Niall 5k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[nh]C[NM: O12 was necessary to protect against the cut at N12/L13.]

 spv 5k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[se];B[rb];W[bs];B[ds];W[fo]C[W198. Infeasible. Should be at E5.]
;B[ep];W[do];B[eo];W[en];B[fn];W[lr];B[ms]C[B205. Wrong! Should be at N3.]

;W[kc];B[od];W[ba]C[W220. At C6 is better.];B[aa];W[ac];B[da];W[ab]C[W224. No rush to play this dame! Lots of point moves left.]
