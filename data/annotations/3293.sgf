Hello johngrae, my name is Corrin Lakeland and I am shodan in New Zealand.  I'll try and point out any mistakes I see in the game.  Since you didn't ask any questions until yose, I'll concentrate on this area.  All of my comments will be prefixed by --]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ec]C[--
I spent a while wondering where I would play here.  E17 means white intends to emphasise the top, and one of the nice things about P17 is it allows the shimari to be extended along the top easily.  Eventually I decided I would still play P17, though I nearly went with P16, intending to play around L17 immediately.]
;B[oc];W[cd];B[fq]C[This is perfectly ok.  Recently I have been having a lot of success with the more passive Q9 here.]
;W[jp];B[fo];W[dn];B[po]C[--
Settling at D2, K2 would force white to N3 or similar, and make Q5 a natural follow on.  I would expect this move to have the same effect but through a different source, but I would worry just slightly that white will find a nice sequence to cause a little trouble, perhaps if white gets F7 nicely and takes gote for D11.]
;W[mq];B[mo];W[lp];B[ir]C[--
I prefer K2 despite white's having the reply of J2.  Allowing white K2 just seems to settle white too fast.]
;W[jr];B[iq];W[jq];B[kn];W[or];B[pr];W[nr];B[cj]C[--
Wouldn't C11 have been easier locally since it makes miai of above and below?  This move asks white to make a double shimari at the top, force black down, and force white to come out at say E7 which will then be a splitting attack on F5 and the C10 group.]
;W[cl]C[--
I can see why white would play here, but with F5 weak I would go the other way.]
;B[cg];W[jd]C[--
I don't like white's fuseki very much.];B[qi];W[di];B[ci];W[dg]
;B[dj];W[ch];B[bh];W[dh];B[bf];W[df]C[--
Right, time to evaluate.  White has placed a strong empahsis on upper central influence with the D11 sequence.  This seems odd with L6 nicely in place so I would be pretty happy as black.  I think you have won the fuseki.  I see F5 as weak, and D4 as week, so I would _immediately_ play D2.  I would have actually played it instead of C11 (your C10), but I can see why you would take C10 first.

Your M17 is a key point, but settling F5 seems more important to me.]
;B[lc];W[ld]C[--
I would feel very happy as black here.  White has put all their eggs into that one basket, and with L6, the basket has big holes in it.  Settle this area in sente, taking points and allowing white to take influence. 

Since white has emphasised influence everywhere else, I am sure they will here too.  

Then come back and exchange D2 for C3, and finally gently reduce the central influence.  The game is looking very good for you.]

There is no need to be this blunt about it.

Lets look at the score.  Count the top (right) and lower right, add a few for D2 (rapidly becoming double sente -- it must be wrong to leave it so long).

You are many many points ahead in terriory, so you do not have to reduce the center much at all.  Assuming you've read some go theory books, there is a balance of territory and influence.  You are well ahead in territory and white is well ahead in influence which will later lead to territory (though rarely directly).  Provided you stay not _too_ far behind in influence, white will only catch up your territory slowly.

D2, C3, P14 would be adequate here. As would exchanging P14 for P11, F8, E10, etc.  Moral: apart from D2, you're in no hurry.]
;W[ej];B[bk];W[pi]C[--
Wow, white adores influence.  At this point I would seriously consider giving up most of the center and just gently peeping at it for the rest of the game.]
;B[pj]C[--
I prefer the more solid R10.];W[oi];B[oj]C[I stronly prefer R12.]
;W[qh];B[ri]C[--
I would personally Have played R10 there];W[nj];B[jk];W[km]
;B[jm];W[jn];B[in]C[--
I would have played L8 because I fear white sacrificing K6 and L7 to cut off K9,11.]
;W[jl];B[jo];W[il];B[kl];W[lm]C[--
I expected M7 to be at L9.];B[mk];W[ll];B[lj];W[kk];B[kj];W[nk]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[mn];B[nn];W[ln];B[nl];W[ok]C[--
I'm now looking back on this move having finished the review.

Do you see that even though you beautifully saved Q10, Q5 is bigger?  Say you play P7 now, allowing white to Q9, your four stones still have aji and you have sente.  I do not know if I would have the courage to do this in a game, and I doubt I would feel comfortable, but in hindsight it would have been better.]
;B[pk];W[ol];B[om];W[pl];B[ql];W[pm]C[-- This is quite soft.  If white plays R9, S9, then R7 by white becomes quite problematic.  You end up living due to R12 being weak, but white does a lot of damage.]
;B[qm];W[on];B[nm];W[pn];B[qn]C[--
Wow, I misread this as not working before you played it.  It would have been devestating for white to see it.]

(;B[ro];W[rp];B[rn]C[--
Given this seems to be gote, is it really necessary?  S12 or maybe Q12 seems bigger. Unless it changes S3 to working.]
;W[cf]C[--
Pity about Q3

Do you agree that if K11 had been less deep, you would have had an easier time here.  

I also note that D2 is now no longer absolute sente for you, though still needed.]
;B[bg];W[eq]C[--
Ouch.  It is very painful to let white play here first.];B[er]

;W[bl];B[be];W[bd];B[aj]C[--
tenuki is bigger.  Also, unless I've made a reading error, A8 settles it in sente.]
;W[ii];B[ij];W[jh];B[jk];W[hi];B[kh];W[jg]C[--
Time to sit back and count again.

The game is no longer looking anywhere near so good with F5 tiny, A10 small and Q3 dead.  You're going to have to push a bit now.  Q12?]
;B[ph]C[--
Right :-)];W[rh];B[oh]C[--
I would have just settled.  You don't know if you'd rather P12 or Q13 yet.]

No, R17 better.  White cannot usefully save R14.];W[qc];B[qq]

Not a chance.  Better to take T4 in sente or just leave it for ko threats. That would have been enough to win the game.]

;W[hg];B[tt];W[tt]C[--

Well, the game was lost because you didn't settle F5 early enough, which let white get a big corner and you a little side instead of the other way around.  Also, your K11 was a little deep, so in pulling it out you had to give up something (you chose the corner).

You also made a few small errors such as taking gote to play A10, but it would have been easier to win the game by 10 points so I would concentrate on the big errors rather than the small errors.]
