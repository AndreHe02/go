C[(Review comments will be prefaced with WOG: )
WOG: Here are some general points:

- Don't walk away from the main arena of play
The rule is "Play the Urgent Move, not the Big Move."  You tend to do the opposite sometimes

- Don't play aji keshi!  You're making moves that kill aji.  You don't know what the right move to play is in an area until it ripens.  You're playing unripe aji keshi a few times, as is your opponent

- When you play a move, try to always have a good follow-up or next move from it.  The popularity of the ear-reddening move came from it having so many good follow-up moves.  Often times you'll play a move that has no natural follow-up.

- You have a STD, unfortunately... Severe Territory Delusion.  Your ideas in the game tend to think to take territory with one move.  Review high dan games with White in handicap games.  Are the moves at first about territory?  No.  They're about positioning, lightness, coordination if possible.  Don't hurt your own moves. Play the urgent move when urgent. Have a good next.  These are the principles that drive White play in high-dan handicap games, not taking a big ol' territory move unless all else in unavailable.  Attack and defense.  Thickness and lightness.  Not one move and, boom, territory.  Go is too uncertain to allow some move before move 100 to be assured to be territory.  You make moves as if you are claiming the territory... be sure not to do that.  The delusion is that territory comes from placing a stone to claim it.  No.  Territory comes like a river down from the mountain... it appears naturally; not because the water thinks of some clever way of getting to the ocean faster.  Go is a game of options.  Placing a stone is placing an option on a territory, but it's also placing an option on attack, defense, good follow-ups or next moves... playing just a territory move eliminates options; therefore, eliminates value/worth of the move.


Dear reviewer.

I was playing black here
I had made some mistakes in this game but there are a couple of moves in which I'm in doubt.
Seems like I had kept chances to win till later yose.

Thank you.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[eo]C[WOG: Wow.  You don't see this very much.  Are you playing Takemiya?]
(;B[hp]C[krv: seems like E5 is rare move. Is H4 good answer?

WOG: It's fine.  Another option is to play c10.

A few things to think about when you encounter a new or novel move:

- Tenuki
- Figure out what it is trying to do and counter it
- Experiment

I like either tenuki or counter the idea of the move and play on the side at c11]
;W[jq]C[WOG: White is playing aggressive.];B[mq]C[N3 is good?

WOG: N3 is fine.  Going to the corner can be considered, say d2, maybe even after j3... lots of possibilities]
;W[jo];B[hn]C[WOG: Now, Black has negated the kosumi stone's influence to some extent.  White has gone in too deep and is trying to have it both ways.]
;W[jm];B[hl];W[dl]
(;B[pk]C[WOG: Don't leave the main area of play!  See variation]
;W[jk]C[WOG: Ouch!  Now, White is jumping ahead of Black and has hurt not just the stone Black just played on the side, but also the line of Black stones on the left.  One more makes a huge difference!]
;B[hj]C[Had black gained from this race? and how about Q5/D10 exchange?

WOG: (My coordinates are different than yours, so not sure what you mean by Q5/D10 exchange)

Has Black gained?  Well, sort of.  White wanted both sides but could only play one move at a time.  That's typically bad.  However, Black went away with q9 to take a big move, but walked away from the running groups.  That's bad.  What's worse - White's bad or Black's bad?  Still White is in a bad spot because of the rather open corner for Black to run into, Black's line of stones is higher than White's, and Black has made some territory.  White's territory from the kosumi and the ogeima are kinda open underneath.

However, Go is not just about who's ahead.  For your improvement, you need to focus on playing the urgent move.  Q9 was an abomination for that rule.  Don't play Big moves if Urgent moves beckon.

Not ideal for either side, both suboptimal.  Black gained from the race, but then gave some advantage back to White by not playing the urgent move at q9.]
;W[po]C[WOG:  Wow.  Another group?   White is creating burdens right and left... literally]
(;B[dj]C[should I cover Q5 with

WOG: Yes, splitting seems to be a good idea.  

Straight cap might be fine at o5]
(;W[cj]C[WOG: This is usually a bad move.  Strengthening Black and still having an open corner is not ideal.]
;B[ci];W[ck]
(;B[fc]C[WOG: Connect is fine too.];W[ic]C[WOG: More groups for White?  This will be group number four?]
(;B[cc]C[WOG: Corner seems uninteresting to me.  So many White groups, why not attack some and then collect territory.  Just collecting territory is a bad strategy.  Have two meanings per move if possible.   See variation which is the better move.]
;W[dc]C[WOG: Now, White has eliminated a group from having to defend; therefore, Black's choice of jumping in the corner seems wrong.]
(;B[cd]C[WOG: I know, this is the joseki move and all, but really, you still don't have to play here.]
;W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fb];B[cf];W[df];B[cg]
(;W[he]C[WOG: This move is fraught with aji]
(;B[ld]C[WOG: Again, away from the main arena of battle.  Split the White below while you still have some groups to split!  See variations for some options]
(;W[kc]C[WOG: Wow.  White is dealing with the aji left from the move at h15, but that's a terrible price to pay.  White prefers to play elsewhere here.]
(;B[mk]C[WOG: Hmmm... making a moyo?  Still seems to be letting White off the hook.  Another rule: Every good move has a good next.  This move's good next is where?  No good follow up to this move.]
;W[ji]C[WOG: Now, White is practically out and/or connected.  Black's line down the H line is hurt, the strange jump to N9 is hurt, and White has White's head staring down the moyo in the upper right.

While White has put White's stones into precarious weak positions, the aggressiveness is paying off with you not punishing White.]
(;B[cq]C[WOG: Certainly big, but not necessarily the biggest.  You were making a moyo.  If White takes the corner, it's gote and you can continue making the moyo bigger.

See variations for some ideas];W[dq]C[WOG: Right.  Black is hurting Black's line of stones by splitting up Black's stones.  Better to reduce here as in the previous variation, or invade after the line of Black stones up the middle is already safe for some reason.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
(;W[fr]C[WOG: This seems kind of loose when White should be playing tight.]
(;B[bo];W[co];B[bn];W[gq];B[hq]C[krv: is H2 good now? should I continue with G3?

WOG: Yikes!  This is aji keshi! There are a host of moves in this area that can help endgame, attack the White line of stones in the middle, etc.  But, you're playing this move as if it is needed now.  

Rule: If the opponent is not going to play there next, why should you?   

If you can answer this question with:

- because I cut and thru the fight I will gain territory or advantage, go ahead
- because I gain territory in sente, go ahead IF IT IS endgame

I admit, sometimes I am in time pressure and play aji keshi, but if you were not in time pressure, there's no need to play this.]
;W[hr]C[WOG: White is so happy];B[hg]C[WOG: Defending and reducing at the same time is the right idea, just wish Black wasn't in this position to begin with... also, not sure what the good next is from this move... try to always have a good next.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr]C[WOG: This move leaves some gaps in Black's lower side... need to be careful if playing this way... weakness at p2, o2, etc.]
;W[qm];B[rl];W[om]
(;B[qe]C[WOG: Seems a bit stunted.   What territory are you hoping to surround with this?  More of this misconception about using a move to gain territory (c.f., STD at the onset of comments)]
;W[nc]C[WOG: White sure likes to keep groups separate];B[lc]
C[WOG: Good spirit];W[ne]
(;B[kd]C[WOG: Interesting instead of jumping or what-have-you you play the turn... jumping may be better here]
;W[kb]C[WOG: White taking profit here only hurts the two stones.]
(;B[ob]C[WOG:  Oops!  I thought you were splitting to attack?  Why let White connect?  Block at M18.  Ignore the White profit!!!  White profit hurts the two stones!

Move 67 smacks of Severe Territory Delusion!  Go is not about taking territory!  Go is about flow... Go is about natural course... This move is about as subtle and natural as an email scam ("I am from _______ (third world country here), I have $20M I would like to deposit in your account if you give me $50,000.  Please send me the $50K immediately so I can get you the $20M.")

White took a profit.  Yes.  That is allowed and is a trade off.   Don't give up the urgent move.  Don't give in to STD.]
;W[oc]C[WOG: White can connect, but chooses not to?]
(;B[pc];W[nb];B[lb]C[WOG: Tewari shows that this should have been done sooner.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[oa];B[lg];W[mf]
(;B[jg]C[WOG: This move is perfectly fine of its own right, but I think it's time to raise the aji on the LEFT to attack the group on the RIGHT, as opposed to the group on the LEFT with the bad aji]
;W[pf];B[rg];W[qf];B[rf];W[nh];B[ph];W[ql];B[qk];W[rm]
(;B[og]C[WOG: The idea is right, but probably better to take the shape away from White first.  Also, r19 is almost double sente]
;W[pe];B[od];W[nd];B[rd];W[nf];B[jd];W[id];B[gp]C[WOG: Aji keshi... potential ko threat... potential other move...]
;W[gr];B[fp]C[WOG: This is late end game stuff...  wrong order, play end game later... this could be a ko threat]

;W[gi];B[hi];W[fi];B[ej];W[gm];B[gl];W[gh]C[WOG: Odd!!  Terrible shape, obvious threat, ugh...]
;B[hh];W[ff]
(;B[eh]C[WOG: With the weakness of White's dumpling, you can play differently]
;W[gg];B[ki];W[ii]C[should K17 be played first?

WOG: White doesn't realize the group on the right has only one eye?  K17 doesn't have much to do with the White group on the right.]
(;B[mi]C[WOG: There's no eye out here for White... take the eyes first]
;W[ma]C[missed this move];B[jc];W[jb];B[la];W[qa];B[ra];W[rb]
;B[pa];W[lf];B[kf];W[qa];B[ec];W[gb];B[pa];W[kh]C[taking at P18 is better than filling, and M12 is better than taking ko?

WOG: You have a lot of big ko threats, OK to answer a few of White's.   Taking at p18 is better because there's still a ko for the dumpling you leave behind]
