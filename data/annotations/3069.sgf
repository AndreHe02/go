C[Kyo [16k\]: Hello !

tomjk [6k\]: Hi! I hope you enjoy my comments!

Kyo [16k\]: I am Kyoshinai, playing white, 16k on kgs. My oppenent is damia, 16k too.

Kyo [16k\]: I have been told lately that my fuseki is quite weak, so I'd like you to focus on that particular point if possible. I think that I pointed out all my huge mistakes in the review, but some might have slipped, and/or the analysis or these may be inaccurate. Please point out anything you think is relevant.

tomjk [6k\]: I can't say that your fuseki is particularly problematic. Up to move 14 everything looks fine. From move 18 on things get problematic, because you changed your strategy.
You main problem seems right now that you put too many weak groups in the beginning on the board. You should try to be more patient and make you own game and not rush to detroy the possible territory you think your opponent could get.

Kyo [16k\]: I left comments and thoughts that occured to me while I was reviewing my own game. Though it may seem useless chatter, I let them in order for you to see how I was reacting and thinking, and thus I hope it may help you criticize my way of analysing.

Kyo [16k\]: Please feel free to add any comments on black's play too.

Kyo [16k\]: I thank you for your time, and please enjoy this 16k game ^^]

C[Kyo [16k\]: It seems like W gets slightly overconcentrated here. Is there a more traditional response to B S16 ?
tomjk [6k\]: nothing wrong here. Also Black has concentrated all his stones on one side. And after Black R11 white has sente. Also Black is a little bit low on the right side. Overall I like white's position more :)]
;B[qj]LB[qh:B][qi:A]C[tomjk [6k\]: R10 is a little bit too far. Normal is at "A". Now remains a weak point at "B".]
;W[cn]LB[gq:C][hq:D][jq:A][lq:B][mq:E]C[tomjk [6k\]: good approach. Also "A" would be fine. If Black approaches from B, white can play C. If Black D, then White E.]
;B[co]LB[dj:A]C[tomjk [6k\]: not so good. it makes White strong. this move is played when Black has already a stone near "A".]

(;W[dn]LB[dj:A]C[Kyo [16k\]: Maybe playing at C9 would have been enough for now. B is not threatening W C6, so C6 may not be the better move, since it forces B to strengthen his lower side.

Kyo [16k\]: See variation please

tomjk [6k\]: no, this is just perfect. Next white "A" and you have a huge moyo (territorial framework). "A" is the perfect extension from the two stones wall.]
;B[fp];W[ck]LB[cj:B][dj:A]C[tomjk [6k\]: too timid. You can play "A" or "B". "A" is better, because of C16 which is on the third line. To "balance" you should play here on the fourth line, i.e. at "A".]
;B[kp]
(;W[pi]LB[ij:A]C[Kyo [16k\]: Here, seeing Black strength on the sides, I thought I had to do something. I aimed at making a wall on the forth line while forcing B to defend itself, and thus prepare a moyo around O14 (even though it is still early in the game, W's position around there is quite strong)

tomjk [6k\]: did you consider "A"? This would be a good move in line with your previous "moyo-orientated" game. Black must do something now or will fall behind. The moyo here would be better. :)

Kyo [16k\]: However, I feel that W should have played this move at Q13 instead, since here the white stoneis quite far away from the upper group, and then will have difficulties creating a moyo. Moreover, I lost sight of my first idea, and as a result it became a weak group I got burdened with.

tomjk [6k\]: there is the weak spot at "B". first you should play "C" and then wait how Black responds. See variation.

Kyo [16k\]: I tried some variations, but they do not seem to come with a satisfaying result for W. Do you have some suggestions ?

tomjk [6k\]: see above.]
(;B[qi]C[tomjk [6k\]: Black should play at "A".];W[ph];B[qh]

(;W[qm]LB[of:A]C[Kyo [16k\]: I tried to reduce B's territory with R7. However, W did not gain much, apart from splitting the two B groups, which B didn't mind since they were both quite strong and alive.

tomjk [6k\]: no need to rush here. You already had a very good result by pushing Black on the third line. Now "A" looks good .... see variation.]
;B[pj]C[tomjk [6k\]: good. Black separates the two white groups.]
;W[om]C[tomjk [6k\]: White is already in trouble. The two white stones are sandwiched between two very strong black positions and have no base to make eyes. This will be a very difficult fight for White and will probably also effect the rest of the board.]
;B[oo]C[tomjk [6k\]: good. Black makes nice profit and attackes White.]
;W[rn];B[ro];W[rk];B[qk];W[rl];B[ql];W[pn];B[po]
(;W[mq]LB[mm:A]C[Kyo [16k\]: Maybe I should have invaded here before R7. Now B is stronger in the area, and W has to struggle for life in the bottom, while reinforcing B on the outside.

tomjk [6k\]: first you must save your group on the right. You create here a second weak group. One of your groups is likely to die in the ensuing struggle. A move at "A" comes to my mind. See variation ...]

C[Kyo [16k\]: I feel like pushing here was bad for W. It strengthen B, and W stones are still weak.

tomjk [6k\]: yes. White is likely to suffer with the right group or the lower group.]

;B[nq];W[nr];B[jr];W[lr];B[ms];W[ks]C[Kyo [16k\]: I misread that part. I did not see that N2 would put the N4 group into atari. W N2 instead would assure W's life on the bottom

tomjk [6k\]: yes, N2 is correct.];B[mr];W[in];B[kl]C[Kyo [16k\]: This is bad. I'm realsing that the Q7 group is getting enclosed, and is far from alive. Trying to escape will result in reinforcing B on the outside, but I decided to try it.

tomjk [6k\]: after the exchange on the bottom it is hard to get the white group around O7 out.
It seems White has lost this game already.];W[il];B[gn]

(;B[kh]LB[mf:A]C[Kyo [16k\]: Is this the right direction ? I think so, since B then chases W group, forcing it to connect, and builds some structure that will be able to make a moyo in the center.

tomjk [6k\]: would be sufficient to play as in the variation (first "A") to connect the black groups and chasing the white four stones. Black wins without trouble.]
;W[ng]
(;B[nf]C[Kyo [16k\]: Shouldn't have B played at N14 to go on with his plans to make territory in the center ?

tomjk [6k\]: N14 before white O13 would have been better :) But yes, also here to make another eye in the center would be better, but Black is greedy and wants to capture another group (even as he is about 70 points ahead (see my previous variation).]
;W[mf];B[lf];W[of]
(;B[oh]C[Kyo [16k\]: I do not really the point of this move. It gives W the opportunity to atari, thus assuring the connection.

tomjk [6k\]: yes, not good. removes a liberty for Black, maybe thought he could capture the stones?]
;W[oi];B[mg];W[ne];B[mh];W[mj];B[kj];W[nl];B[mm];W[pf]C[tomjk [6k\]: excellent result for white! White connects his stones which were previously dead! Let's count again ... Black now about 70 points, White about 60 points. The game is close again! :)]
