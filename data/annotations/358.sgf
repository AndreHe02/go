[nc]C[The single white stone is too small and light to
attack now.]
(;B[kp];W[qf]C[Your move strengthens a weak stone. Don't
touch weak stones. You lose as asset when your opp. strengthens his
weakness.]
(;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[og]C[Same problem here.  White's single stone is a good target. You
know that. The problem is that you attacked by touching it. If you keep
away, the target will become more valuable.]
(;B[nd];W[md]C[The cut doesn't work.  Plus white has
touched you, and you need to respond. Maybe p17 is best. I am not sure.]

;B[me];W[ld];B[oc];W[nb]C[Key thought here. Normally with a double kakari (O17 and
R14), you touch one stone and attack the other. Notice that you no longer
have an attack on either side. White has done well in the upper right.

Also, note that it's still going to be tough to kill the single stone on
the lower side with one more move. White can escape upward or play L3. You
didn't gain much by your tenuki at l4.];B[de];W[cg];B[ef];W[eg];B[fg]C[Joseki move is d13]

(;B[ce];W[ee];B[ed];W[ef];B[ek]C[White should take the 4th line territory here. Then black has a large heavy group.
F16 captures two small stones, and give black upper side territory.]
(;W[fd];B[fc];W[gd];B[gc];W[he];B[eq];W[ep]C[c3 is too thin. You have too many weak groups
near here. Get safe before attacking. c9 give you safety and negates white's top side thickness.]

(;B[cq]
(;W[dq];B[cp];W[dj];B[fq]C[Now, white has the big ugly group. And white is splitting two strong groups in the
lower left. Similar to black's strategy in the upper right.
:-)];W[bd];B[be];W[hc]C[Weak group... Don't touch it. Surround on a large scale.
Don't play on a point that your opponent doesn't want.

Now with two weak groups on the lower side, your L4 is looking good. :-)

 I am not sure what the best move is on the lower side. I am looking for a
profitable attack move, or at least profit with attack possibilities.

I've shown a couple of attacking ideas.

D2 ends all your weaknesses. That makes for an easier game. Of course, e17
would be simplest of all.]

Attitude problem here. After a contact, in general, hane if you are weak, extend if you are strong.

You are VERY STRONG here. If white lives in any way here, you are way behind in territory.

Those two sentences imply a required attitude of strong attack. Play the
3-3 point and let white try to find a way to live. It will be very hard with all your thickness.]
