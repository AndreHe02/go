C[I played as white in this game, and while I won it (albeit a little fortunately), I found that a repeat feature of my game came up again - namely that I tend to struggle to make central influence, resulting in my opponent getting one or two very large moyo. I suspect I'm just missing the early-to-mid-game key points or expansion opporunities, so for the most part I'm hoping to have some of these highlighted, and maybe some pointers as to how one would spot them.

I also have a couple of other questions through the match, which I've asked at the appropriate times. Other than that, any other points you feel are worth commenting on will be gladly listened to!

Many thanks in advance for your answers!

Hi,

My name is Tom and am currently 6K at KGS. I have answered all of your questions to the best of my knowledge and left some other comments. I hope my review will help you improve your games. 

The key moves that determined the overall flow of this game are Moves 28-30. You defended your territory with 28, Black completed his/her moyo with 29, and you completed your moyo with 30. There is nothing wrong with these moves. It is just a matter of personal preference. However, if you preferred to split up your opponent's moyo, you had different options. I will explain this issue more closely later.]

;B[mc]
(;W[jb]TR[cd][jd]SQ[mq]C[I believe you tried to protect your upper left territory. But this is not so efficient. There are still several ways for Black to invade the upper left, and since your marked stones do not have a base, one of them could be attacked. 

Note that people extend to the fourth line when they are interested in creating a thickness or influence toward the center, rather than getting territory on the sides. If you had played K17 instead of K 16, it would have made sense to jump to K15, or to protect the region with F16 or G16.  In this case, it makes more sense to try to build up a thickness on the upper left. 

Also, this is a very good chance to split up your opponent moyo by approaching the lower right. I recommned N3, which reduces the influence of Black's strong F1 group.]

;B[mf];W[lf];B[lg];W[kg];B[mg];W[ji];B[il];W[qq]C[I know the idea with corner invasions is that one should ideally invade the turn before your opponent reinforces the corner. I'm currently unable to predict exactly when that turn would be, so that aside, would this be considered as good a time as any to invade, or are there more pressing points that should have been attended first? One that occurred to me a couple of turns after playing this was M10, but by then it was a bit too late.

I think this move is good. Actually Black should have reinforce the corner earlier and you should have played here earlier. I would have played at Move 34 after playing E16 or E17 at Move 32. Since this invasion is sente for White (the eequence ends with Black), you can reduce Black's influence toward the center after that. Check the variation from Move 31.]

(;W[kq]SQ[ec][ed]C[Reviewing the game later on, I felt K3 might be a bigger point (I made it worth 3pts more for white) - is this correct, or am I misreading it?

Yes, K3 is worth several points more for White. However, the biggest point at this moement is E16 or E17.]

;B[ec];W[dc];B[hc];W[ed];B[ea]C[I ended up letting this invasion escape from me, and against a stronger player would probably have been punished more severely for it. Is there a better way to have dealt with it?

Black's E19 is not a good move. Although Black had some chance to live with a small territory at the moment of Move 95, now you have a good chance to kill Black.]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[fc];B[db];W[ec];B[gb];W[cb];B[he]TR[gg]C[At this moment, Black does not have enough space to make two eyes. All you have to do is to loosely surround the group with G13. It is not a good idea to play in contact with the stones you are trying to capture.]

(;W[ae]C[This is where I felt I was fortunate to win the game - I spent a couple of minutes thinking about this, and only after playing this stone did I realise that A14 would give black life. For future reference, am I correct in thinking that A14 followed by either A13 or A11 would kill this group?

The group was dead as it was at Move 157. White does not need to do anything. I will leave one way to kill the group after Black plays A14 first. 

There is a proverb on the stones aligned on the second line like this: 6 dead, 8 alive.
If the stones are on the corner, it becomes: 4 dead, 6 alive]
