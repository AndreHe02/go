C[This is a typical game for me.  I can't seem to keep my groups alive.  Thank you for commenting on my game.

Hello Matthew,  this is my first review for the GTL. My name is Florian and Im 11k on KGS. Please excuse my bad english. If you have any questions feel free to write to: groine@gmx.at

Some generell comments:

Try to avoid "empty triangles".

You must have a reason for every move. If you decided a strategie you must stick to it till it succeed or you can see it will fail.

Keep your groups connected and split the opponend. It may seem small to connect groups, since it dont get territory, but a
runnig group will loose more territory.
   In this game where a lot of unsetteld groups. Whoever moves first will decide the fate of the group. If you cant imagine a sure way to get two eyes
and your opponent is strong nearby add a stone. If possible keep a connection to the center. This gives you the oppertunity to run, if you cant life
lokal.  If you learn some basic shapes and solve some problems your L&D should improve fast.

I hope the review will help you.

Florian];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[cn]C[Florian:
I would play around p3. But c6 is a good move too.
White will usually answer this move.];W[nc];B[jc]TR[pf][qf]
[qg]SQ[jc][kc][lc][jd][kd][ld]C[*I think this was a mistake
on my part, should I have played belwo Q16 somewhere?
Florian:
Its a good move. In generall there are two main types of answers to a corner approach like o17.
1) Extensions (triangles). They are peaceful and easier to handle than  2) Pincers (squares). The purpose of a pincer is to prevent the attacked stone from forming an base.
Bot are playable, but you have to know what you want to achive.]
;W[qf]
(;B[oc]C[Florian:
Its  _very_  importand to split w.
w will have troubles to defend both sides.
I added two standart sequences (joseki) for this position.]
;W[nd];B[of]C[Florian:
q14 is better.];W[oe];B[cj]C[Florian:  Good];W[fp];B[oq];W[mq]
C[Florian:
Your opponend played a close pincer. Its now important to establish a conection to the center]
;B[nr]SQ[no][oo][po][mp][pp]C[Florian:
Wrong direction.  Play at one of the marked points instead.]
;W[mr];B[qq];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp];B[pq];W[sr];B[rs];W[oo];B[np]
;W[nq];B[or]C[At this point I can't see how to keep this group alive.
Florian:
If w plays p4 you have to play q2, if white plays q2 you have to play p4 and run to the center. There is enough space to get an second eye]
;W[op]C[Florian:
Now you must play q1. This is the the only way to live. After q2 you could play either o1 or r2 to get  two eyes(miai).  If w get q1, b is death.
This is a standart shape, called "bulky five".]
(;B[pp];W[po];B[le];W[nf];B[og];W[pe];B[mf]C[Florian:
Strange move.  What is the meaning of it?];W[ng]C[Florian:
Treat this stones ligthly. I would play q10. If you try to settle a group, these two stones will be a permanent danger to w. This is a better way to use them.]
;B[oh];W[nh];B[dg];W[em];B[dl];W[fk];B[do]C[Florian:
Small. How about g17?];W[eo];B[en]C[Florian:
This is a bad move. Sure, w has to answer, but dont play forcing moves just for the sake of it.
w is forced to play a move which he want to play anyway, because it forms a nice wall. Furthermore its gote for black]
;W[fn];B[dn]TR[cn][dn][do]C[Florian:  This shape is called "empty triangle". Its a standart example for bad shape. Try to avoid it.]
;W[cp];B[jp]C[Florian:
This is a good time for an invasation. I would still prefer the left side, because you have already some stones there.]
;W[lo];B[hq];W[gq];B[hr];W[gr];B[kq];W[hp];B[ip];W[jn];B[lh]
C[Florian:
Your invasation isnt alive yet. Dont play elsewhere.];W[li]
;B[qh]C[Florian:
I would play r9. you can either extend to r12 or r6. You will life a lot easier.]

;W[ob];B[pb];W[nb];B[qe]C[Florian:
This move is bad, since fills one of your own libertys. They are important for a non-living group.
I think s18 instead should allow you to live.];W[pf]
(;B[io]TR[io][ip][jp]C[Florian:  Empty triangle
I would first try to live locally, even if it isnt possible here(see variation)). Maybe w plays a wrong move.]

The next empty triangle (see variation).];W[gm];B[hm];W[il]
;B[fi];W[hl];B[gn];W[im];B[hj]TR[hh][ih]C[Florian:
This move is better played at one of the marked points .];W[ii]
;B[hh]C[Florian:
If you would have played move 105 on h12, you could stop the invasation with j12]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[ig];B[if];W[hg];B[ge];W[cc]C[Florian:
The 3 3 invasation will life in most cases.  But you try to keep it small.
I added the standart joseki for an 33 invasation.]

Florian:  You seem to be in a turmoil between stoping w and killing w. You had to  come to a decision.]

w is already alive.];W[ca];B[gc];W[hi];B[fd];W[fb];B[hb];W[gj]

yes. s18 had to be played earlier];B[pc];W[pa];B[se];W[rf];B[rc]
C[Florian:
You are death. dont die in gote];W[ps]C[Florian:
Death. This it the vital point for live.];B[qr]C[Florian:
Dont die in gote];W[lr]C[Florian:
k4 group is death now];B[ms];W[mp];B[kr];W[ls]
(;B[ns]C[Florian:
Better at j2. w can still kill but its a bit tricky now (see variation)]
;W[ir]C[And then another, I must be doing something very wrong.
Florian:
Yes.  You had lots of unsetteld groups. see my initial commends]
