C[Thank you for taking the time to review my game. I had reverse komi of 5.5 for this game, but I think I should of had more of an hadicap. What number would you suggest?]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc]LB[oc:A]C[The opening is fairly normal up to this point. Black five could be played in a number of places (P17 for instance), but the move at F17 is perfectly fine.]
;W[db]C[I haven't studied much joseki, so I didn't know the best response. I went for influnce with a kosumi, but now looking back I should have went for territory. Right? What is the best move for that?]
;B[ed]LB[jd:A]C[The move at E16 may not be the best choice because contact plays often make the opponent's stones stronger. To me, K16 seems a bit better because it makes a base for black's stones and extends towards the upper right corner.]
;W[ee];B[fe];W[ef];B[ff]C[Now black is pushing from behind, and white is getting a huge corner.]

(;B[gg]LB[ei:A]C[Locally, E11 is probably better. If white tries to cut at F13, black can use the net (see alternate),  but even with the play at E11 white is gaining fourth line territory which is an unfavorable result for black.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[fb];B[gb];W[fa];B[hb]LB[ei:A][fp:B]C[I not sure about this move. Is there a better way to defent aginst a cut? Or should I have played else where?



Locally, G19 is probably better but stopping white's advance on the left side is more important than protecting against the cut (E11 or F4 might be a good way to do this).]
;W[ei];B[gh]LB[pj:B][fp:A][jp:C]C[Don't know about this one either. I should have play something to stop his advance on the left side, right? Maybe C6?


A play at C6 might be little too close to white's strength in the upper left. I like F4 or Q10 better. The former attempts to reduce white's expansion, while the latter takes advantage of black's thickness on the left. K4 is also big.]
;W[ek];B[fj]C[The peep at F10 only helps strengthen white's inposing left side. Black 27 might be better placed at K4.]
;W[ej];B[ij]LB[pj:B][jp:A]C[Was my advance to the center too early?


J10 seems a little overconcentrated. A play near the star points on the bottom or the right side might be better.]
;W[jp];B[mq];W[lq]LB[oc:D][qj:C][pn:E][cq:A][nq:B]C[White captured the bottom left courner and most of the bottom. What would have been the best way to stop White?


The 3-3 invasion in the lower left corner is still an option. Other possibilities for black 31 might be O3, Q6, C10, or D16.]
;B[mr]C[Locally, I like N4 better. It makes a heavy shape but white's two stones at the bottom are overconcentrated as well.]
;W[lr];B[ls];W[ks];B[ms];W[kq];B[fq]LB[mo:B][cq:A]C[F3 creates a difficult situation for black. The exchange through black 53 is very profitable for white. The 3-3 insvasion is still viable, and it seems a little more uregent after the exchange at the bottom. A move at N5 might also be good.]
;W[eq]C[This fight here becomes quite confusing.];B[fo];W[fm]
;B[gm];W[gn];B[fn];W[hn];B[hm];W[jn];B[jl];W[em];B[fl];W[el]

;B[mn];W[oc]LB[oe:B][qg:A]C[This is the fight that cost me the game. What is the best way to defend aginst P17?


Black should push white toward his thickness on the left. R13 is a little less severe than P15 but it essentially does the same thing.]
;B[qf]C[This is the right idea. You don't have to kill your opponent's stones, only threaten to do so and make a profit in the process.]
;W[kc];B[md]LB[mc:A]C[White 86 is one space too far. Black should cut white in half at N17.]
;W[mc];B[lc];W[lb];B[ld];W[nd];B[mb];W[nc];B[kb];W[nb];B[la]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[rb]LB[pd:A]C[Q16 is probably better because it robs white of eye shape.]

;W[mg];B[nh];W[me];B[lf];W[le];B[ke];W[kd]C[This is where I resign. I am still working on counting so tips on that would be nice too. Thank you.


As far as counting liberties, my best reccomendation is to practice life and death problems for  few minutes every day.This will help hone your reading skills. As to your earlier question about what handicap should be played between you and your opponent, this is difficult to say having only seen one game. If this is someone you play with regularly I would recommend playing a few even games and then making adjustments from there.]
