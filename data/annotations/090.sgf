;B[cn];W[qf]L[fq][fp]M[qf]C[The  marks stone is an alright move. Very aggressive so early in the  game though. points a or b are typical responses.

Going at a or b is particularly good because it works well with and  extension from R4]
;B[fq]C[Black has now made in roads on the territory that  could easily be  staked out on the bottom.  By ignoring C6 you have weakened both D4 and R4.

D4 because it will be tough to live.  and if you do it will be small.  R4  because now and extension from it towards point a is not as strong as when  D4 was safe]
;W[cq];B[eo];W[dj]L[dg]C[This stone is being thrown out to defend  itself.  It doesn't work  with anything on the board.  It ignores how strong B is on bottom left and  invites a squeeze play at point a.  Then you will have to run.  You will  have a strong black between two weak white groups.  One will surly die, or  both will live very small.  And Black will profit well]
;B[md]C[Black ignores this invitation by playing safe and playing what white  should have done in lower left.]
;W[rd]M[rd]L[pj]C[Backing off to a  first is better because it works with you lower  right stone, plus it makes a good 3 space extension]
;B[ej]M[rd]L[qc][fj]C[Point a is the usual response to the marked stone.

Plus it is a bad move. It would have been better at point b if black want to  make a moyo in the center.  But a pincer works better.

Never touch what you are going to attack!];W[dl];B[el];W[cf]C[Good.  This  helps white's stones get a life and attacks the corner.

The lower left still looks weak though.  But Black doesn't have a base yet  either.]
;B[oq]C[Black is going for a large moyo in the center.];W[op]M[op]L[np]
[po]C[The marked stone missed the best point for attacking black  and  building the right side by one point.  Point a tries to keep black low, it  is safe because it can connect to the corner above or below if you get in  trouble.
point b is the safest move.  It is sente as it strengthens an attack on the  black stone and builds your territory on the right.]
;B[np]M[op]C[Black is staking  out territory on the bottom and the marked stone is  weak. Thus White must play defensively allowing Black to move off the third  line.]
;W[oo]L[no]C[Now you should see why P4 was inefficient.  Black  should continue to  press White to gain by playing a]
;B[ef]L[fc]C[This stone would be better  if played at "a" to make a shimari to  protect the corner and side.  It does little to stake out territory in the  center and doesn't really attack white at all.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[ei];B[fi];W[di];B[dk];W[ck];B[ek];W[dm]M[dm]N[*];B[em];W
[dn];B[do];W[co];B[cl];W[cm];B[bl];W[bk];B[bn];W[bm];B[dg];W[cg];B[fg]C
[An inefficient move.   Any attack would force black to connect so a  move to claim the corner or top or bottom would be better.

I prefer the corner];W[pj]C[A good move, It claims a lot of territory on the  side.  And because  Black didn't press further at O5. White can get even higher off the side.]
;B[nj]M[nj]C[A weak move. It tries to stake out territory but works with  no stones.]
;W[jq]L[no]C[A good move, but premature.  point a should be taken  before this  move.  Otherwise this white stone will be lonely as Black takes this vital  point.]
;B[no];W[on];B[nn]L[mq]C[A better move for black would be to  cramp K3 from getting an  extension.  These stones don't have a base yet.  Point a protects the cut  and builds eye space]
;W[mq]C[Good play by White!  Attacking blacks  cut point and makes an  extenstion to get life.]
;B[nq];W[gr]N[*]C[Another good move.  Expand  territory while linking corner stone out.]
;B[er]C[A good move by black, by  keeping both white groups apart.  But it  ignores O5 group that doesnt have a base yet.  It also ignores the territory  to be had at top left.]
;W[gp]N[*];B[go];W[jo]L[ho]M[jo]C[I think  the marked stone should be at point a.  It attacks the left  side while building territory.  While the marked stone doesn't really work with anything yet.]
;B[jn]M[jn]L[hp]C[The marked stone would have been better at point a.]
;W[in];B[hp];W[jm];B[kn];W[ho];B[gq];W[hq];B[ip];W[iq];B[jp];W[kp];B[fp]
;W[io];B[gp];W[ko];B[ln];W[hm]L[nm]C[White should look around the board and ask himself are my  groups  alive?  If the answer is yes, then White should ask are blacks?
It should be obvious that the O4 group is weak, and the surrounding white  stones are strong.  Thus a move that surrounds these stones while building  territory is a good.  Such as Point a]
;B[kk]C[Black is content with  running into the center and trying to get  territory there, even though White has broken into the middle already.]
;W[hk]C[Threating the B L6 group or O3 group would be better.  That or  invade top left.]
;B[il];W[hl];B[im];W[jk];B[jl];W[ik];B[km];W[gh]C[This is a  bad peep.  It does nothing for white and only serves to  strengthen black]
;B[fh]C[But Black cooperated.];W[gi];B[gj];W[hi];B[jj]C[Black should have continued to crawl through cutting the white  stones apart.  There is no territory for black to capture with this move]
;W[hj];B[jh]C[The top is being ignored for the middle.  Think of it this way
It takes a minimum of 6 stone to live in the corner, 8 on the side and 10 in  the center.  For each move one player gets the other can match them.  Thus  center territory is very inefficient to fight for!]
;W[hd]C[This is not a great  attack.  It's in the middle of blacks groups and  far from a white group. Black can easily safe up the corner and cut this  stone off.]
;B[hf]C[I don't know what this move is suppose to do?  It  doesn't stake out  territory and doesn't safe up an endangered group.  But it does ignore the  top.]
;W[fc]N[*];B[jd]C[Black should have protected corner];W[cc];B[dc];W[db]
;B[cd]M[cd]L[eb]C[Point A is much better than the marked stone.  It captures F17 and  H16 while threatening D18 as well]
;W[ec]C[Now white is alive on the top, and  b has lost a lot of territory.]
;B[cb];W[eb];B[bc];W[ic];B[jc];W[jb];B[id]M[id]L[kb]C[The marked stone would be better off protecting easy  territory on  the side.  As well as a chance for territory in the corner.]
;W[hb];B[gd]C[An  attack with no purpose.  There is no chance Black can capture  anything and it stakes out no territory.  It only serves to strenghten white  and settle whites stones.]
;W[gc];B[he];W[kb]C[Now White is taking more  territory on the side and limiting what  black can get.]
;B[lb];W[pl]C[Good Solid territory now.];B[nl];W[ph];B[oh]C[Don't touch stones you don't want to make stronger!  White will only  crawl now making him stronger.]
;W[pg];B[og];W[oi];B[ni];W[of];B[nf];W[ng];B[nh];W[ne];B[mf];W[pe];B[od]
M[od]L[qc]C[Black should protect the  corner by playing at a];W[qc]
C[Instead White gets it.];B[oe]C[Black captures  2 stones while letting the corner get away?]
;W[pf]C[This stone was unecessary.  It  would have done a lot more good  taking the corner.  Who cares about one stone.]
;B[qd];W[re];B[qq];W[pq];B[pr];W[pp];B[qr];W[nr];B[or];W[mr];B[oj]C[This black stone should be used  to gain back some territory in top  right.]
;W[pi]C[White cooperated though.  It would have been a small loss if  Black  broke through.  Both whites groups would be alive and White would have the  corner in exchange for the loss on the side.]
;B[om];W[pm];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[lp];W[lq];B[cr];W[bo];B[bq];W[eq]
;B[fr];W[hr];B[bp];W[cp];B[dr];W[ep];B[ao];W[an];B[ig]C[What is this black stone doing?
The corner is more valuable.

If you win all four corners, you most likely won the game!];W[lc]L[mb]
M[lb]C[A squeeze at a would be better.  It claims more corner territory  while it attacks the marked stone.]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[nb];W[la];B[ld];W[ob];B[na]L[pc]M[qc]C[This black stone does nothing really.  It would be better used at  the point a.  Threatening the marked stone as well as capturing P18.  The  corner is lost but Black can minimize Whites gain.]
N[*];W[oa]C[Now White as the whole corner and a solid 15 points.];B[oc]
;W[pb];B[fd];W[en];B[fo];W[gn];B[fn];W[fm];B[fl];W[gm]C[The game is basically over  now.

White has won by capturing the four sides and one corner while depriving  Black of most of the center.

Black has won 3 corners and a little of the center.];B[gs]M[gs]C[There is  still some territory to be had on left side.  The monkey  jump to a14 would gain Black 8 points.

Plus the marked stone is a gote move and Black loses the intiative.  White  can ignore it at take mor of the tope left.]
;W[hs];B[fs];W[ma];B[nc];W[kc];B[kd];W[be]C[Finally the biggest pont left.]
;B[df];W[ed];B[ee];W[hg];B[gg];W[hh];B[pc];W[qb];B[ce];W[bf];B[bd];W[ih]

All moves after this are pointless.];B[qn];W[qm];B[rn];W[rm];B[lr];W[ls]

;B[ha];W[qg];B[ks];W[js];B[fb];W[sm];B[gb];W[fa];AE[sl][rl]C[General Comments for Black

Should play more for the sides and corners.  Leaving the option open for the  center. Don't play primariely for the center.  It's inefficient.

General Comments for White.

Should ignore the little stuff.  If you are alive then take territory by  threatening weak stones.  Don't attack for the sake of attacking something.   Make sure it stakes out territory.]
