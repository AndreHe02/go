Hi, 
I was asked to review for both sides and will try to do that. My comments will be prefixed by "Gus:" I will use the black/male white/female convention often found in modern publications for pronouns since the kgs handles don't make it clear.

The story of this game is black got off to a rotten start, blowing up a joseki, and playing too close to white's very strong stones, then white, who was up by 20 points started picking fights and got herself in trouble. Eventually white failed to live and black killed a large number of stones, thereby reversing his fortunes.

Black should try not to play close to thickness and pay attention to cutting points (the problem in the joseki!)

White should work on avoiding a fight when ahead and not making crude moves that help black.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf]
(;W[be]C[Gus: Up to this point the game is profesional quality, though this move is an older, territory oriented style (Diagram 18 in Pattern 20 in A Dictionary of Modern Fuseki: The Korean Style)]

(;B[dd]LB[ee:C][df:A][ef:B]TR[be]C[Gus: This move results in a slight loss at best for black. The continuation in the game however was a disaster for black. When white makes the marked move, white becomes very strong. The same is true for the more common variation where white draws back. In both cases Black needs to get strong as well. It's never good to have weak stones next to your opponent's strong group. A, B and C are reasonable ways to make yourself stronger.

If your opponent is strong make sure your stones are either strong, or light. This is heavy and has a weakness at A]
;W[cc]
(;B[bf]C[Gus: Here black fails to protect the cut. Furthermore, both sides are important. This is 2 weak groups in the making.]
;W[df]C[Gus: This is a disaster. It's really hard to say what black should do from here.]
;B[ci];W[ef]C[Good move by white. black is separated and running on both sides]
;B[fd];W[fb];B[cl]C[Gus: Black is helping the stronger stones. Generally helping the weaker stones is better.]

(;W[gf]C[Gus: This seems like the right direction for white. strengthen the 2 while attacking.]
;B[ic]C[Gus: Thin. Black can be cut. This is a very bad move even if black is sacrificing the stones, j17 will still be too close to white after white captures. This is forcing white to capture without gaining anything.]
;W[hd]C[I don't think black can escape now. Even if he does, white is strong enough in the center so black will only rescue the stones in Gote.]
;B[gc]C[Gus: Black is adding to a dead group.];W[hc];B[gb];W[hb]
;B[eb]C[ Gus: black can make only one eye];W[ec]
(;B[ge]C[connecting one eye to an eyeless pair of stones does no good at all.]
;W[he];B[hf];W[fe];B[kc]TR[ic]C[Gus: the marked stone is unimportant. It represents neither power nor territory. Both it and the move played are too close to white's thickness to be very useful.]

(;W[nc]C[Gus: This seems premature for white. Yes blacks stones are weak, but stepping back a second white is way ahead in territory. The only hope black has is building a big area. All f white's stones are in the upper half of the board. Supporting the lower left or approaching the lower right seems slightl better since that makes it almost impossible for black to get a big area later. If black defends his stones, invade the corner. his territory is already undercut on the top.

Variations show some things I think are more reasonable];B[oc]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[nf]C[suddenly it's not so clear who's  attacking who]

(;B[ng]C[Gus: Pushing white in the direction she wants to go.]

(;W[of]C[Gus: Crude move by white. Strengthening black while filling her own liberties. Sure it's sente, but it is probably -10 or -20 points in sente!

It's really hard to describe just how incredibly costly this move was for white.]
;B[og];W[ke]LB[of:A][og:B]C[Gus: the A-B exchange still seems unnecessary.  if it didn't help the next move then really it shouldn't be played.]
;B[je]C[Gus: Not sure if this is possible.];W[jf]
(;B[ie]C[Gus: This is probably not a good move. it takes 2 more moves to create an eye here, and black is hitting his head against a wall (filling his own liberties)]
;W[if];B[hg]
(;W[lf]C[Gus: White can alsocapture directly];B[gd];W[ed];B[ib]
C[Ok prressing from the outside is a decent idea, but I don't think the black stones can live inside here. If they can't live, then this is just helping white.]
;W[fc];B[id];W[ga];B[lb];W[mb];B[mc];W[md];B[lc];W[ob]
(;B[pb];W[kd]LB[of:B][og:A]C[Gus: White came out mostly ok, but look at the edited board in the varation. sure seems like white would prefer to not make the a-b trade]

(;B[fq]C[Gus: Good move. This is the  only reasonable strategy for black, but should survive.]

(;W[cn]C[I'm not sure I like this move. It feels like playing right into black's plan. with c8 in place this just isnt very strong. 

However, I had to play with variations for a long time to find anything better.  Perhaps w should tenuki or counter pincer....  almost every variation I look at winds up with  sente being urgent for white.]

LB[of:A][og:B]C[Notice how your group is almost cut off from the center. 

Agian, whtie is wishing that the AB exchange hadn't been played. (see edit)]

(;W[qe]C[Gus: Conceptually this is the loosing move for white. White  is picking a fight when he is ahead. picking a fight is the best way to lose a game from this far ahead. If you are leading keep it simple and try to get a *fair* result. Winning by 20 points is the same as winning by 80. This point should be left as aji. if all goes well, white may want to simply reduce in sente at q19 instead or if w gets a *strong* stone at r12 this becomes a real threat. Right now it just helps black.

This is where white begins to loose a won game.]
(;B[pe];W[qc];B[pc]C[Gus: White now has put 2 stones inside black/s area and made black strong in the process.]

(;W[qg]C[Gus: Not good This isn't even connected to the two stones. white is giving away points left and right now.]

(;W[ni]C[Gus: Oh no! white missed an oportunity (see var). What's worse is the horrible shape white is making. too many cutting points.]

(;B[qo]C[Gus: Seems slow, the move near k4 is bigger. Also this still leaves the monkey jump. an incomplete fix is often a very good move.]
;W[lp]C[Gus: feels a little too close to the black stones on the right. L4 or L3 feels better to me
