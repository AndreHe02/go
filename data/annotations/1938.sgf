C[Hello my name is Rogerio,
Thanks for reviewing my game : )

I´ll comment during play...];B[pp]C[Hi Rogerio,

This was a good game.  B lost mainly because of some careless moves, but otherwise it was close.  I'd simply recommend you to make a rough estimate of the scores two or three times during the game to have a better sense of how you should proceed next.  It'll give you a stronger sense of control and usually better results if you know where you stand at any point during the game.

Goodd luck.

(;B[cn]C[B could also play D4 instead, to build up outside influence, which'd be more consistent with playing two 4x4 stones at the start.]
;W[cp];B[dm];W[fp]C[F4? is this a joseki? if not how  can I punish him?

not joseki.  the problem would seem to be it leaves W vulnerable to B pressure from the right]

Black has sente.  So it's still a pretty even game.];B[jp]TR[pb]
[nc][nd][ne][nf]C[Better at K3 to take advantage of W's F4, to force W to make another move to fix the shape there, while B can take profits in the bottom.    Alternatively, play Q10 instead, to put pressure on the marked stones on top, floating without a base.]
;W[qn]C[Poor choice, since this allows B to pincer nicely.  Better at R9 to split the side and keep an eye on R3 for later.]
;B[ql]TR[qc][pd][pf]C[better at R9, even R10, because the UR B groups is a little weak]
;W[on];B[ol]C[B should simply play O4, even O3.  It's still too wide open on the right side even after P8, particularly with W sticking out at O14.]

(;W[rp]C[Might be better for W to simply take the corner.]
(;B[po]C[Not sure what this was for.  B at least wasted a forcing move here, but for what gain?

Make sure you hold off on forcing moves like this unless you have a clear follow-up plan.  Otherwise, save them for ko threats down the road.]

since W can still run out on the left, O11 doesn't seem to be effective.  Would be better for B to push W to the left by playing at P12 or, safer, Q12.]

(;W[ri]C[W wasted a move here.  Should at least go settle in sente with R18 etc.]
;B[gn]TR[ee][ff][fg][gh][hi][ij][jk][kl]C[Bigger to play in the top half of the board.  the line shows the demarcation between possible spheres of influence, and it's more important for B to push in this direction to prevent W from building from its thick wall on top.  In contrast, W has nothing to build from down below, so it's less urgent to play there.

H3 would be huge for B if not for the defect on the right side.]

(;W[hg]C[Seems to be a rather random move.  E14 or E13 better.  That way, W can expand its moyo while putting pressure on the thin B group on the left side.]
