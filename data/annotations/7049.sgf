C[I'm playing white in this game. My style has tended towards center influence of late, and this game is somewhat representative of my games in general. I was somewhat concerned about my transparency here, so anything overly blunt, I would appreciate you pointing out. Is there something in particular I should work on? Thanks for the review.

-romp

crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt, 2d.  I'm not strong enough to know correct play, but I'll try to give you some ideas what to think about.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[hc];B[fe];W[df];B[fg]LB[dh:A]
[kc:B]C[crux: Somewhat unusual.  I guess A and B are more or less miai.  Being invited to play A is good for White on one hand, but the pincer afterwards will work nicely for Black.]
;W[dh];B[kd];W[ec];B[fb];W[he]C[I'm not sure if I should be satisfied here, thoughts?

crux: No idea how to evaluate it so far.];B[id]C[bad, right?]
;W[hd];B[ce]C[premature?

crux: Absolutely.  It helps solidify White's shape and leads to an exchange of the roles of attacker and defender.]
;W[de];B[cc];W[eb];B[cd];W[fd]C[crux: Black has lost.];B[bg]
;W[po]TR[mc][md][nc][nd]C[crux: Note that you could split Black somewhere in the marked area (probably with a high move), and the two black stones can come under attack.  That would be a good way to continue after the previous success.]
;B[mq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[ql]C[crux: One space further is maybe more usual.]
;B[qj];W[np]C[crux: Strange move.  It strengthens Black by erasing aji and doesn't seem to help you in any way.  Your extension is already narrow, so adding another stone makes the position overconcentrated.]
;B[nq];W[jq]C[crux: Don't approach strong stones, certainly not the ones you've strengthened with your previous move.]
;B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cl]LB[cq:A]C[crux: The left side is uninteresting - no territory to be made there.  I'd play at A without hesitation.]
;B[cq];W[dn];B[cm];W[dm];B[ic]TR[md][nd]LB[hb:A]C[crux: If you answer at A, your stones are totally secure, Black's four stones are still worthless, and you're still threatening an attack around the marked points.  This seems most important to me.]
;W[pj]C[crux: Your own group is strong, and the black stone is weaker.  Normally this means you shouldn't attach to it.]
;B[qk];W[pk];B[rl];W[qm];B[pi];W[oi]C[crux: You're giving Black secure territory on the side.  I don't think you get enough in return.]
;B[ph];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd]C[crux: Strange move order.]
;B[re];W[ob];B[nc];W[rc];B[oe]TR[ic][id][kd]LB[nb:A]C[crux: Note that you've lost a possible attack on the marked stones since Black is now very strong.

Also interesting is that neither player plays at A for a looong time, which is a pretty large point.]
;W[mp]C[crux: I'd call this bad shape, since Black can hane at the head of two.]
;B[hb];W[bl]LB[co:A]C[crux: Playing A first doesn't leave you with the defect you get in the game.

However, I think it would be better to answer Black's last move.]
;B[co];W[dq];B[cr];W[dr]C[to small?];B[an];W[jo]TR[mp][np]LB[lp:A]
C[crux: If you're going to play in this area, I'd play A, which makes better shape for the two marked stones.]
;B[gd]
(;W[ge];B[ed];W[ff];B[gf];W[ef];B[dc]TR[dl][do][lp][oj][op]
C[I was ready for a very tough fight here, but this seemed small. My influence to this point seemed somewhat dubious. did I go wrong?

crux: You have influence, but all your positions have defects (marked with triangles), and at the top your group has just been cut into two pieces.]
;W[gc];B[ea];W[hf];B[gg];W[hg]C[crux: I'm not sure what best play is around here, but I'd think about taking the ko.  Winning it would be big for White, as it connects two groups and makes Black's cutting stones meaningless.]

(;W[qh];B[ok];W[pi];B[ll];W[kj]C[crux: Possibly too direct.]

(;W[ol]C[crux: This is terrible.  It allows Black to live in what was a lot of solid white territory.]
