C[I was unranked on KGS when I played this game,

I am Black.

I submitted this because even though I won, I felt I shoiuld have lost, though as a beginner I could be wrong
.
=========== reviewer ============
Hallo,

my name is Ulrich alias pmurk (mailto:pmurk.go@googlemail.com). I play on KGS as pmurk, currently around 12k (IGS as pmurk65). Please keep in mind that - even my ranking is higher - I can only indicate my point of view which might contain erros ans misreadings. 
I tried a summary at the end and added variations to explain my thoughts. 

I will mark my comments with prefix pmurk];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[nq];W[fq]
(;B[jj]C[I did this because it felt like it was turning into a mirror match. My first question is that is it too early to assume it's a mirror match and if so, when should I start assuming this and play on tengen (if at all)?

pmurk: good question: 
- For those unfamiliar with the word: tengen ist K10 (the middle point of the board)
- a pro verb says: corners, sides, middle. Following this I would have not played at tengen. A possibility is shown in the variation-
- But as you said: This moves prevents a mirror game and is definitely not wrong.]
;W[eg]C[pmurk: To high. I would prefer third or fourth line]
;B[of]C[pmurk: as before with white: to high];W[em]
(;B[gd]SQ[fd][fc]C[pmurk: 
- very peacefull: If you want to play here you should either play F16 or F17 and then follow the joseki]
;W[ec]C[pmurk: I think this move has to be answered - see my variations]
(;B[jp]SQ[pj][pk][pl]C[pmurk: If not to answer move 12, I would play around marked area]
;W[hq]C[At this point I feel as if G16 was not a good move because it can be separated from my other groups and that my other groups are all disjointed and can be separated and killed. What is your opinion?
Also, are whites groups better placed?

pmurk
- About G16: already commented
- White is still vulnerable with the split at C10 
- You are right, your groups can be at least seperated, but you have more influence which somehow balances this out. KGS result estimates you ahead at this point but I feel the machine does overestimate your influence.]
;B[hp];W[dj]C[pmurk: This one was painful for black as now an invasion has become more difficult.]
;B[pj]C[pmurk: this is a good response to W D10. maybe Q9 instead is even better (leave this to answer to a single digit kyu]
;W[gc]SQ[hc][hd]C[pmurk: This move needs to be answered. Possibilities are marked. Remember the proverb: "if attach, hane" or move along the fourth line and gain influence, therefore making use of the tengen stone]
;B[iq];W[gq];B[fc]C[Should I go at F17 or elsewhere on the board instead of here? I feel as if this move was bad because it gets cut off easily...]
;W[fd]C[...like that];B[fb]C[Should I have let that be and played elsewhere?]
;W[eb];B[gb]
(;W[fe];B[ge];W[ff];B[ea];W[da];B[fa];W[hc];B[db]C[Instead of going on H16 should white have gone at D18 to prevent that stone's death, or does it not matter?]
;W[dc]
(;B[ca];W[cb];B[hb]C[I feel as if this was the right move in this area because If I go D18 then I think that group is dead.]
;W[da];B[ic]
(;W[ba];B[hf]TR[nj]MA[gc][hc]C[are the white stones that are at G and H 17 dead, so I didn't have to capture, or can they escape at this point?

pmurk: 
- As long as white does not place a leader breaker (example O11 marked) the 2 marked stones are marked. I have added the ladder as an variation at move 40 to show what happens without a ladder breaker.
- Do read about ladders and train to read them as they are important.]
;W[gg];B[hg];W[gh];B[ij];W[hj];B[ii]LB[hh:A]C[Since I've played this I've learned that empty trianles are bad. Where should I have gone instead (if anywhere).

pmurk: empty triangles are bad as they are slow. H12 does the same.]
;W[hi];B[hk];W[gk];B[ih]SQ[hl]C[pmurk: no need to play here, but need to extend at G8]
;W[gm];B[ji]C[No clue why I went there,]
(;W[go]C[pmurk: white should have played at H8 or cut at J9 (see variations)]
;B[kj]C[Oh, I remember now! I was at senei's library and saw a "B2 Bomber" and though the people were serious, so I tried to form one. I went back and saw that it was a joke and now I am dieing of embarassment from not seeing the humour.

pmurk: get something out of it! Your group is very heavy, without points and low on influence. Remember this and you will never do it again.]
(;W[in]C[This might be cut off easily, can it?

pmurk: I can not see how to cut this off as the stone is protecte by 2 small knight's jumps. B H5 is answwered by W H6, and B H6 (see variation).]
(;B[im];W[hm];B[hl];W[gl];B[jn]C[pmurk: this move opens a double atari and is therefore very weak (see variation)]
(;W[io];B[jo];W[ip];B[hr]SQ[jq][jr]C[pmurk: as you learned seconds later you need protection against the cut at H3 on either the marked spots]
;W[jq];B[kq];W[ir];B[jr];W[iq];B[kr]C[pmurk: calculate the difference of the game and at protection at move 65 - it is big]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg]SQ[qg]C[pmurk: joseki says this must be at the marked spot on the third line. If you play stronger players like I am you are in serious trouble. I try a variation.]
(;W[sg];B[sh];W[sf];B[rh];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]
(;B[pa];W[qa];B[oa];W[rd]C[Could whites stones have been killed by goiing where white went a few turns ago? It seems like it.

pmurk: correct];B[is]C[pmurk: this move including the following sequence is gote - at the end white can choose to play anywhere. try to think about moves which are sente so you keep the active role.
if you really want to play gote you could i. e. protect the SE corner with R3.]

(;B[hh]SQ[qo]C[pmurk: please see my variations - at least a ko or a reduction is possible]
(;W[gi]SQ[qo]C[couldn't white have lived without going there?

pmurk: your are right, no real need to protect here at this point 
But B need protection agains a cut at R5];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq]

;W[fr];B[dr];W[cs]SQ[bs]C[could I have lived at all? or was that a bad choice to play in that corner?

pmurk: You can live in the corner, the attack was ok as youi can live in the corner. But you need to finish the sequence with B2!]
(;B[ep]SQ[nl][ql][qn][no]C[At this point I probably should have resigned. don't know why I didn''t.

pmurk: Count it out, you are leading by more than 40 point but are vulnerable to an invasion around the marked area.]

pmurk: you are underestimating the position - see the variation. 
With both west groups dead you still win by 142 to 111 if the counting os correct.]

Thank You in advance for your time.

pmurk: 
- I really enjoyed the review and do hope that I am correct. It is my first GTL review on a 19x19 board so. I wish the best to you and hope you have much fun with the game. 
- as I pointed out, there are at least 2 spots (marked) which W should have used to harm B. Both should be used to reduce B territory but not enough to turn the game. A player stronger than I am will invade and life inside, even so I can not show it to you.
- With proper play the SW corner would be alife,  the B9 group would be dead.]
