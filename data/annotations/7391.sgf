C[Inego: Hi, I'm Yanis Batura from Novosibirsk, I play as Googol [6k\] on KGS.
Inego: The game was dominated by Black from the midgame on, and although there were some blunders from his side, it's obvious [12k\] is not a rating for him; I estimate it at least [10k\]. So if Yaoundee plays further (and more carefully) his rating must improve. I like the way the bottom W group was hunted and it was the key point of winning the game.]
;B[pd];W[cq];B[op];W[cd]C[Inego: Now enclosing BR corner seems appropriate.]

(;B[ep]C[Inego: See var.];W[do]
(;B[dm]LB[eo:A]C[Inego: This leaves a too big gap between your stones. A is more common. See var. for the sequence seen in pro games.]

(;W[cm]LB[en:A]C[Y: What about 'A' instead? It cuts and attacks the two black stones and spread whites influence towards the centre without loosing territory in the corner.

Inego: See var.];B[dp]C[Inego: This move forces W to connect at C4, so it is bad. Never make forcing moves unless they force the opponent to get worse.]
;W[cp];B[cl];W[bm];B[dn];W[co]C[Inego: If you close the gap at E5, you'll connect your groups and get the outside influence. If you leave this gap, W will be able to separate your two black groups and make both weak.]
;B[ec]C[Y: Here I already had a bad feeling about the shape I produced in the lower corner. As for the upper corner, my play, that now follows, was really bad.]
;W[ed]C[S: I prefer B. A is a bit difficult...]
(;B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[dd]
(;B[bc]C[Inego: Safer is C18 or B18 (see var.)];W[eb];B[ea]
;W[fc];B[fb]C[Y: Well, I know, I should have defended at C19 right now. And it still is urgent in the following moves.]
;W[ec];B[gb];W[hc]C[Y: Here white already could have invaded in the corner at c18.

Inego: You are right.];B[gc]C[Inego: Another bad forcing move.]
;W[gd];B[hd]C[Inego: Closing at E5 is bigger and urgent.];W[id]
C[Inego: You had to sacrifice this stone (see var. at the next move)]

(;B[he];W[hb];B[ge];W[fd];B[ca];W[ga]
(;B[fn]C[Y: after this desastrous sequence I left  the place to stabilize my somehow scattered stones down there.

Inego: Yes, E5 is in need of a patch. But your move can be exploited (see var. at the next move).]

(;W[jp]LB[nc:A][kd:B][qj:C]C[Y: Is this strong? It seems quite risky to me. White could as well spread her territory at the top - i.e. at A. And what about B or C?

Inego: C is really much safer.];B[md]C[Y: same questions here. which are the big moves respectively keypoints? (And is N16 really better than N17?)

Inego: Locally, N17 is safer since the stone is near a strong W group H17. O17 is even more safer. Globally, solidifying LR corner is bigger. My choice is R4.]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[ld];B[mf];W[kf];B[ig]C[Y: I think I benefit a lot from the last moves. White claimed a quite small territory at the top. It has a weak stone on the bottom. So now I try to connect the upper left group with the lower one, to expand on the right AND to dominate the centre.

Inego: A good plan. But you must take into account the fact that the W can make her moves, too :)]
;W[kh];B[mi]C[Y: I try to get a HUGE corner...];W[pj];B[eg]
C[Inego: By making this move you give W a chance to settle at the right!]

(;W[cg]TR[gc][fb][gb]C[Inego: Seems W has forgotten that triangles are dead :) She could settle at the right and make your HUGE corner a tiny one.]
;B[df];W[cf];B[pn]LB[ph:A]C[Y: I learned that you strenghten the opponents weak group if you attack it directly. So I keep distance. But I'm not sure if I can apply this rule correctly. Q6 seems to me more balanced, but my upper territory is still open and white's single stone has still a way to the centre. Whereas 'A' at least encloses my territory.

Inego: This move is solid.];W[qg]C[Inego: A very good move by W.]
;B[ij]LB[kj:A]C[Y: My purpose here was not to follow white's direction but to exploit white's efforts on the right to enlarge my moyo. I'm already strong on the right and I own both corners there, so why not let white to build a Moyo on the edge, which is still isolated, while surrounding territory at the left and threating to connect/cut at 'A'?

Inego: I wouldn't say you own the both corners, especially the TR corner (it can be invaded). Besides, W has a strong cutting move at D8 which can easily make the left side her territory or at least ruin what you consider your center territory.
57 is not bad, but locally K11 is slightly better.]
(;W[mq];B[hq]
(;W[oq]C[Inego: Playing lower is safer.];B[pq];W[or];B[pr]C[Inego: Now W has the standard shape following O4 (see var. at the next move).]

(;W[di]C[Inego: Locally the best move was the cut at D8 but W missed it.]
;B[ek]C[Inego: Protects the cut.];W[fi];B[bl]C[S: The next move was to prevent black B6.]

(;W[cn]C[Y: That move was pointless in my eyes.

Inego: Right. Pushing at E5 is better.];B[np];W[qm];B[qn];W[nl]
C[Inego: A bad move.]
(;B[nq];W[nr];B[mp];W[lq];B[jq]C[Y: coming from below to make it hard for white to live. Above I have good influence and I still can prevent her from joining O8.]
;W[kq];B[jr];W[ko];B[ln];W[kr];B[ho];W[jn]C[Inego: A horrible move. Pushing at E5 or even at S6 is bigger.]
;B[io]C[Y: pointless?

S: It was.];W[jo]C[Inego: This move is as horrible as W's previous move. It achieves nothing but an ugly shape.]
;B[ll]
(;W[jl];B[jk];W[hl];B[gj];W[qe]C[Y: I get the impression that I left white too much space at the edge. She can make about 20 points,  while the chain from N14 to M6 doesn't bring me any. But I have only two groups where she has four...]
;B[qd];W[er];B[fr];W[fq]C[S: Just stupid.];B[dr];W[dq];B[eq]

(;B[fp]C[Inego: Blocking at F5 was OK too.];W[rd];B[rc];W[re]

Inego: A misclick?]
(;B[rm];W[rl];B[sn];W[kj]LB[li:A][ji:B]C[S: I find A a bit pointless, when B would maybe give some terretory to black..?

Inego: It's not a moment of the game when you can speak about territory -- life and death of a big white group is at the stake.]
;B[li];W[ki];B[kk]C[S: Pointless?

Inego: Solid. Now W must be very lucky to save its bottom group. By this I mean some sequence in the center where everything has not yet stabilized.]
;W[lj];B[mj];W[lk];B[ke]
(;W[je];B[le]C[Inego: Now L8 is the last chance to try saving her bottom group.]

(;B[kc];W[kb];B[lb];W[jb];B[ie];W[jd];B[im]C[Inego: This move is good, it destroyed all W's prospects here. W should resign now.]

;W[mr]LB[ls:A]C[Y: This is not urgent but too late. At least I don't see how white could make two eyes IF black plays right at 'A'

Inego: Right, there's no way now for W to save her group.];B[lp]
C[Y: So here's the chance for white to make at least the half of her stones live.

Inego: Yes.];W[kp];B[oj]C[Y: Again I didn't see how to kill 18 stones. White could make them all live.

Inego: Even if W makes them live, you win (because W let you live in the UL corner earlier).]
