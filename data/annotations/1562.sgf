C[Japanese 1D was rank quoted to me by Mr. Masao.

Hello Jason,

my name is Christian Reiling.

I am German 1 dan, igs 4k* and 2 dan on kgs.


First of all the ranks of both players confused me:

White: masao333 JAPANESE 1D

Black: Jason Guetzkow 10k

Are these ranks in different rating systems?
Since you clearly won, this would mean you are at least Japanese
2 dan. Japanese 1 dan is about European 2 kyu - but I think White
is weaker than this.

Somthing in general:

When I say this is good or bad, it should mean that this is good
or bad from my point of view - stronger players than me might
have an other opinion.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[cc];B[jp];W[jd]
;B[qf];W[qh];B[of];W[nd]
(;B[ph]C[JSG: Is this premature, or timely in light of black stone in
lower right star point?

This move is not good, IMHO.

It only strenghtens White, but Black get neiter territory nor
adequate thickness in this exchance.

See variation here.];W[pi];B[oh];W[qj];B[qd];W[qc];B[rd];W[rc]

(;B[qg]C[JSG: Was this really necessary?  I was trying to develop a strong
splitting group, but may be a little bunched up on one spot of
the board.

I think this is a good and strong move.

But see also variation here.];W[qm];B[rh]LB[np:A]C[I think this is too slow. White doesn't have to answer here.

I would suggest to reinforce at A instead.]
(;W[qi]LB[np:A]C[This is too slow - White should play A instead.

See variation.];B[ok];W[ri]LB[np:A]C[White should play at A.]
;B[rg]LB[om:A]C[JSG: Here again is a move I probably should have  ignored, right?

Yes.

Black should play A instead.];W[ro]LB[np:A]C[Both players seem to dislike to play at A!?]
;B[qq]LB[pn:A]C[I think this move is not possible here.

Black should play some move around A instead.];W[nq]C[Looks good.]
;B[np]C[JSG: Should I attach the pincer like this, or focus on escape
path with b P5?];W[mp];B[no];W[lq];B[oq];W[ln];B[nm];W[rl];B[nr]

(;W[mq]TR[jp]C[JSG:Did I make the right choice here by chasing white up (against
my wall on right)?

When you say "against", you have to say with "what" :) .

But "what" you mean here is only the marked single stone.

This stone is very weak at the moment.

White should play as in the variation.];B[jn];W[ll];B[jl]C[This is very good for Black.]
;W[mr]LB[jr:A]C[Too small. A would be better.];B[or]LB[dj:B]
[dd:A]C[This is too small and too slow.

A or B would be great moves here.];W[jr];B[iq];W[ir];B[hr]C[JSG: Was this hane move bad here?  I guess not, since it worked.

No, I think this is ok.];W[jq];B[ip];W[mn];B[nn];W[nj]
(;B[oi]C[See variation here.];W[oj];B[mk];W[kk];B[pk]C[JSG: Are moves 58 and 60 just bad--giving white opportunity to
connect at P10?  Or was it necessary for me to use these sente
moves to make my splitting group stronger?

I think this is already answered by my last variation.];W[pj]
;B[qk];W[rk];B[ml]LB[lj:A]C[Black should play A here instead.]
;W[kl];B[lj]TR[kl][ml]C[The exchange of the two marked stones is very bad for Black.]
;W[mi];B[mh];W[li];B[kj];W[jk];B[hl]LB[il:A]C[Overplay - should be at A.]
;W[jm];B[il];W[im]C[JSG: Can white hope to escape with this line?

I think White is not in great danger at the moment.];B[hn];W[hm]
;B[gm];W[gl]C[Overplay - White has to connect.];B[km]C[Punishing Whites overplay.]
;W[lm];B[in];W[jj];B[ki];W[lh];B[mg];W[hj];B[ih];W[fj];B[dj]
;W[fl];B[dl];W[em]LB[cq:A]C[White should immediately take the corner with A.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[dn];W[eo];B[ep];W[gr];B[hs];W[gq];B[hq];W[gp]
;B[er];W[kn];B[fo]C[Yes! The only move here.];W[go];B[fn]LB[gn:A]
C[A looks even better - makes an eye  and takes a liberty.]
;W[fp];B[fm]C[This is bad, since it takes an own liberty.
Be careful with moves like this.

At the moment you got enaugh liberties, even with this move.

Your group has no eye now, and it can be necessary to capture
the white group in yose - this would be a big endgame loss.]
;W[el];B[gs]LB[dd:B][kp:A]C[JSG: This move is clearly awful.  Owing to my inexperience, I
thought i should I should connect at bottom, rather than just
kill white's G2 group.  I'm a little weak in lower right corner.
Should I strengthen with b  D5 now?  Or, should I ignore my splitting
groups and coninue attack of white's dragon?  What is tesuji
here?

This move is not necessary at the moment. You have more liberties
than White. But when you are not sure, you should play this move!

D5 is not necessary IMHO. Here also: When unsure just play it.

I would suggest A here instead. This is absolutely sente,
doesn't cost you a liberty and reduces Whites eye space.

Afterwards I would suggest to play B.];W[fr];B[fs];W[fd];B[hd]
C[JSG: I always worry when i see moyo building and I overreact.
Here I cut his 4th rank wall and then make a run for it, allowing
him to make a safe haven for his dragon.  Would it have been
better to renew my attack of his dragon, perhaps by extending
left-side wall with D12 or E12?

I think the white group is not that easy to attack here.

D 12 is surely good, but I think your move here is also ok.]
;W[ie];B[he];W[hf];B[ge]C[Bad shape.];W[gf];B[fe];W[ed];B[ff]
;W[fg];B[eg];W[ef];B[ee];W[df];B[de];W[cg];B[cf]C[JSG: Perhaps b G13 would have been better here?

This looks good.];W[dg];B[eh];W[gh];B[ch];W[bf];B[ce];W[bh]
C[Very bad - W must connect at B15.];B[dh];W[bg];B[be]C[Yes!]
;W[bj];B[bk];W[cj];B[ck];W[ci]
(;B[ai]C[Not this way.

See variation.]
(;W[bi]C[White should play as in variation.];B[di];W[ek];B[dk]
;W[aj];B[ah]C[Not necessary!];W[af]C[JSG: White's group is dead already, isn't it?    White is VERY dead :) !

Why does he continue to make moves there?

Don't ask me :) !];B[ae]C[JSG: Totally unnecessary move made due to my inexperience (I'd
only been playing go for about 2 months), right?

Yes, unnecessary.

2 Months ???

Are you kidding me?

If this is true, you can give me lessons after two additional
months :) !


 Even if I was worried about losing liberties race, b H17 would
be better, right?
What is tesuji here?];W[do];B[co];W[js];B[ak]C[JSG: Another wasted move, right?

Yes, very wasted.];W[cp];B[cq];W[bp];B[cr]LB[bq:A]C[This is wrong - must be at A!]

;W[oo];B[op];W[sr];B[qs]C[JSG: Seems a blunder on my part.  I should have just played b
R2.  Allowing ko fight cost me lots of points.

I would suggest S1 here.];W[rs];B[ss];W[dq];B[eq];W[rs];B[ij]
;W[ji];B[ss];W[hm]
(;B[sq]C[JSG: Should I have continued ko battle?    Yes!

I wasn't sure if I would be able to make any more meaningful
threats so I let him kill
me and connect to his dead group at F5.

Right!];B[gi];W[fi];B[fh];W[jg];B[kg];W[jh];B[kh];W[sj]C[JSG:  Is this really necessary for white?  Seems a little slow.
