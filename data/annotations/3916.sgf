C[Dear reviewer
I'm sylvainc, black in this game

I will ask a few questions during the game, but I would like special comments in yose, because I'm especially weak in endgame.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[qi];B[qk]C[Good, even if R11 is one space closer to the lower shimari, as    is more usual, an thus R9 ought to be at R8, an extension in front of this shimari is very good.]
;W[qf];B[qe]C[Good again, not allowing white into the corner leaves the stones cramped and that's why R11 is usually played at R10.
In that case R15 would be dubious.];W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[qd]

(;W[rf]C[Too slow, black is already alive in the corner, so capturing a stone is only 6 more points, while for white saving it does'nt make the group completely alive, I prefer the variation shown.]
;B[oe];W[pf];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd]C[so, have you first comments about fuseki. I find white concentrated on top right side, right ?

Yes, so far white has fallen a bit behind.
But now you have left a weakness behind.];W[me]C[I think it's good, but is difficult to find best way.]

(;B[ne]LB[nd:A][nf:B][of:C]C[right move or not ?

Well, protecting the cut with A seems too mild, B or C do cut the white stone in a more clear way, but then the cut looks more dangerous.
Deep reading is needed to know, and when it's impossible to read everything you must weight the risks you want to take and how confortable you are in a figthing game.
I can only show some possibilities.];W[md]C[White decides on toughest followup.]
;B[mf];W[lf];B[og];W[ph]
(;B[ke]LB[mg:A]C[here I think I should made bambou.

I would prefer A, as an atari there by white helps the running stones.
In any case, the peep is very bad as black is forcing white to connect at a place a cut was possible, while the peeping black stone is not really necessary for the survival of black's group.
Even if it looks like a vital point for white, it doesn't bring an eye yet.]
;W[nf]C[Now there's 2 possibilities]
(;B[mg]C[The second option, keeps white weaker on top, but black gets cut so the rigth becames strong.]
;W[of];B[od];W[le];B[lg];W[kf];B[jf];W[kg];B[mi];W[kh];B[li]
;W[oi];B[ok];W[ng]LB[jp:A][jj:B][nj:C][nk:D][rk:E][ql:F][qm:G]
C[is it necessary for white ? I don't see

I don't see neither, A B or C seem better.
But now that white has 2 eyes moves like D, E, F, etc look possible.]
;B[ki];W[ih]
(;B[jp]C[I think it s better than left side, right ?

Agree. This moves builds up an enormous moyo and checks a white extension at the same time.]
;W[hq];B[ck]LB[io:A]C[Maybe A is better.];W[ci];B[cn];W[dn]

(;B[co]C[is it best response ?

I prefer the more usual hane here.
Geting sente to reinforce the right quarter seems very important.]
;W[do];B[cp]C[With this move the corner can swap colors, but now white gets to play at center - lower - rigth, destroying a lot of potential points.]

(;W[cq];B[iq]
(;W[bq]C[H4 better,no ?

That would be just playing what black wants, and you must look always for chances to get sente and play your own point-gaining moves. B 3 is very big, and must be played to justify C3.]
;B[dm];W[em];B[hp]
(;W[cm]C[Maybe too tempting?
look for another possibility:];B[bm];W[dl];B[cl];W[bp]LB[ej:A]
[ik:B][nk:C]C[A bit slow I think, I would close black in with A, which also helps a lot the upper white group that is not fully stable yet, black must live, then B or C maybe.]
;B[bi];W[bh];B[cj]LB[di:A]C[Maybe better at A, to be sure to get out.]

(;W[bj]C[This let's black get out, and there's not a strong white wall there waiting, but a running group. This can be dangerous, I prefer the variation shown.]
;B[di];W[ch];B[bk];W[ai];B[ek]C[Black sequence : is it best way to stabilize my stones on left side ?

I think that even better than you could hope for.];W[ji];B[gq]
LB[lk:A][fi:B]C[Really big, but A or B are safer moves.];W[ik]
;B[jj];W[ij];B[hi];W[jk];B[ll]C[Good];W[kj];B[nj]LB[mk:A]C[A is better shape here.]
;W[bn];B[dm];W[bo];B[cm];W[el];B[al]LB[eh:A][fk:B]C[Bad, first must play in the outside I think. This is 1 eye in gote, now white has the initiative to chase black and, as it happens, get back some points. 
Something like A or B looks good.];W[dj]LB[fi:A]C[Instead of cutting, A seems more annoying.]
;B[dk];W[ej];B[fj];W[ei];B[fi];W[eh];B[fl];W[fm];B[gl];W[gm]
;B[fh];W[eg]LB[fg:A]C[Better at A, no need to be afraid of this atari.]
;B[gg]LB[gf:A]C[Too slow, I see no problem at playing A.];W[ge]
C[Good];B[jg];W[jh]C[This exchange is bad for black: loses 1 liberty, gains nothing.]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[gf];W[fd]
(;B[he];W[gd];B[hd]C[Now the marked stone is rather useless, and at G17 would have made a very big difference !!!]
;W[gc]C[after white G15 (104) was there a better way for Black to close ?

Not sure, it ends in a very big ko, and even if black can win it is not clear what happens. See variation.]
;B[hc];W[gb];B[jm];W[hl];B[gk]LB[hm:A]C[Why ? Black has already 2 eyes, even if cutting at A doesn't look necessary and it can back fire, there are bigger moves.]
;W[im];B[jn];W[kc];B[fo]LB[eq:A]C[here began yose
I find my moves toosoft, please give me comments

To begin with, better first A, white connects then F5

Yose itself was not that bad, the big issues where rather life and dead problemes with 2 of your groups.]
;W[fp];B[fq];W[ep]LB[eq:A]C[A better];B[eq];W[dq];B[rp]C[Was this necessary ? I thought all my points were in my  moyo and white S4 could reduce, no ?

Yes. Maybe A or B would be reinforcement enough to allow to kill any invasion, but it would not be an easy task.
If you count you behind, then O17 is the biggest move.];W[nc]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[pb];W[nb];B[hb]C[Small, right side is bigger.
And dangerous, the upper right corner is not that well.];W[ga]
C[too small, see previous points.];B[rj]C[Biggest besides upper right corner problems.]
;W[ri];B[cc]C[desesparate or no ?

Absolutely impossible to make 2 eyes here.
Maybe for white to tenuki now would be too bold, but  if white is behind can try it. Or better, read out if he can really or not.]
;W[db];B[dc];W[eb];B[cd];W[de];B[cb];W[be];B[ec];W[fb];B[bd]
C[Black is dead as it is, so 1 point gift in gote so far.
So lets see the upper right corner here:]
(;W[ab]C[Oh! white presents back sente and 1 point :)
This was first "last chance" for white to make a big come-back
attacking the upper right corner.];B[ce];W[bf];B[ed];W[ee];B[dr]
C[Besides avoiding the ko at the upper right is biggest move,
although G5 is not small neither... and maybe sente now that I look closer to it. K18 is big too.]
;W[cr];B[er];W[gp]LB[ho:A]C[Maybe A is better.];B[ho];W[go]
;B[jc]LB[jb:A]C[A is better];W[jb];B[ib];W[kb];B[oa];W[qb]C[a move too late]
;B[rb];W[na];B[qa];W[pa];B[qc];W[pk];B[pl]C[Yes, the other atari is too dangerous]
;W[pj];B[ql];W[kq]C[This can't work neither.];B[mq]LB[jr:A]
C[Maybe A would make you more comfortable about H3 stone ?
Or just killing H3 should be possible.
Now L3 will serve a purpose.];W[lk];B[mk]LB[ml:A]C[This leaves a lot of bad aji, maybe A would be safer, allowing black to keepa couple of more points in the end.]
;W[kl];B[lm]LB[km:A]C[A can be played without fear I think.]
;W[km];B[kn];W[ln]
(;B[mn]C[If instead of N6 black can play H2 now is a big gain.
And I think black can ignore this cut.];W[ds]C[Now D1 is 2 points in sente.]

(;B[hr];W[hh];B[gh]LB[hg:A]C[Not that necessary, A is better.]

(;W[if]C[Enormous move, worth ... how many points ?];B[hf];W[ig]
;B[je];W[ie]C[This is sente !!! Black has to make eye with H10 or J16]
;B[nh]C[Ah !!!
Second "last chance" for white come back ...]
(;W[ni]C[Very nice move.
 But white was alive, and there were big things left !! see variation]
;B[jl];W[mh];B[lj]C[Terrible !! Not only you force white to protect 2 stones that could be taken, but you are removing one of your much needed liberties.]
;W[kk];B[lh];W[oh];B[mj]C[This is worth a stone in a ko, any single point in gote is bigger than this.]
