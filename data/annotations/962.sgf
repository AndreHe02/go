PL[B];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[cf];W[fd];B[di];W[cm]C[I am not too strong in joseki / fuseki and was not to sure how to reply here. I ended up making the move I did for side influence, but I think that is too early?

RickMott: I think C9 is too small.  Locally, I'd play B16 first to reduce white's corner in sente.  Then consider a big move on the bottom or right side; Q10, K4, for example.  Your upper left side group will never make big territory, but it reduces white and will be hard to kill.  Just leave it for now.]
;B[ck];W[qf];B[qh]C[I tend to like playing the pincer, and sometimes over-play it in the wrong situation. When is it relevant?

RickMott: Depends on what continuation you want.  I'd be happier with this if you were stronger on the lower right, but it's OK. I'd play a loose pincer, say R10, which works better with your Q4 stone.]
;W[of];B[nd]C[RickMott: Now your R12 stone doesn't look so good, right? Too easy for white to counterattack and destroy your potential on the lower right side.]
;W[rd]C[I think that this variation is not so good, due to the o16 p14 trade off.]
;B[qc];W[qj];B[pg]C[RickMott: Why peep here?  Just forces white to strengthen, doesn't help you.  Jump to P12 directly.]
;W[pf];B[oh]C[Maybe too early?

RickMott: or not needed right away, other moves are more urgent.  Consider a counter-counter-pincer :).   If you play R7, at least you can start potential territory in lower right.  Or jump further out to O12, threaten to enclose the white group above you.  P12 loses sente.]
;W[lc]C[RickMott: if you'd played O12, white couldn't do this. You could respond with N14 and white has to fight for life.]
;B[mc]C[I do not like this shape. Is there a better way to respond to m17?

RickMott: Yes... don't!  You will do better attacking the stone at R10.  You can always either make life or escape to the center with your upper right group, but again it will not make much territory.

Basically, in the opening you should rush to take big points in open areas of the board before responding locally unless you think your group can be killed.  In this case, you have the move at S17 to both make life and threaten the white stones below if white makes a followup to M17.  The bottom of the board is the largest open area now.  Consider a loose pincer at R7 followed by a move at K4.  Look more balanced?]
;W[qm]C[RickMott: White reinforces his single stone and now it's much harder to attack.]
;B[mq]C[RickMott: too small and not sente.  This isn't the time to make territory.  Both the 3-3 invasions would be bigger. S17 is good, reducing the white group's potential to make eyes.  A move like J17 to threaten M17 and also reduce white's upper side is also possible.]
;W[ro];B[rp];W[hq];B[co]C[The idea here was to split the two white stones creating an even stronger left side. maybe followed by c17 later. it was either this or  the 3,3 point

RickMott: but take the sente plays elsewhere first before starting this fight.  I think you have better invasions than this one. White's other corner is weaker.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bq];B[do];W[bo];B[bn];W[ap];B[cn]C[Success but at what cost? loss of sente?

RickMott: maybe worse than that.  If I were white here, I'd play B7 threatening to connect underneath.  If I do, you get almost nothing for spending 4 stones and strengthening white's corner.  If you block, I jump out at E7.  Now your group is floating with no eyes and your upper left side group is vulnerable to a big reduction by a monkey jump at A10 later.]
;W[kq];B[eo]C[I think this move was to try and cut between d4 and h3. However it was ignored and the bigger point of k16 taken

RickMott: If you're going to play in this part of the board, play D7 and eliminate the bad aji from C7.  But you're right, the upper side and upper left corner are the most important for both sides now.]
;W[jd];B[mf]C[RickMott: you're probably intending to attack the white group, but this isn't the way to do it.  White can play O13 to split you and you can't stop him.  Your 3 stones around Q12 may be in danger.

Play S17 first to prepare.  If white tenukis, you always have the big endgame play of S15.  If white answers, you have made profit in the corner in sente and can continue the attack.

Say white jumps out to N14 himself.  You probably have another sente with M16, then jump to N12.  This gets your weak stones out into the center in sente.  Then reduce white's upper left corner and the game is reasonable.]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[rc];B[rb];W[qd];B[qb];W[ng]C[RickMott: these were all forcing moves for white and he got to split you anyway.  Now you have to be concerned about the black group with no base.]
;B[nh];W[mg];B[mh];W[oq]C[This move had me worried. However, the sequence turned out for the best I thought. Did white make a mistake here?]
;B[or];W[pq];B[qq];W[np]C[RickMott:  I'm surprised he didn't play this move at Q2.  I think you'd have more trouble if he did.  P2 doesn't strike me as a good idea.  He can split you fairly easily and either run into the center or attack your two weak stones, making life in the process.

I like responding to P3 originally with Q3.  Makes corner territory and white has to worry about his stone.]
;B[nq];W[op];B[pr];W[po];B[qp];W[qo]C[RickMott: White strengthens his right-side group, so your wall on line 12 does no good now and the group may come under attack at some point.  Your corner territory is pretty small.  Bad trade.

White looks better now, but he has some problems. Your best chance of equalizing territory is with your left-side group.  You have to get in B16 and then press down on his lower left corner with G4 or something.  You can block him at M13 and threaten the placement attack at S15, which would fill his eye space with a dead shape.]
;B[mp]C[Up until this point, ranks were not known. I made the mistake of asking my opponents rank

RickMott: too small.  You needed to go after some of his big structural weaknesses.  If he gets to fix them up, you have little chance.]
;W[mo];B[lp];W[lf]C[RickMott: and here's one of the big points.  If you'd played M13, he couldn't do that.]
;B[lg]C[RickMott: can't do this now, he can capture you.];W[me]
;B[li]C[I was happy with this as it gave me a few forcing moves

RickMott:  But where are you going to make your territory?]
;W[nj]C[RickMott: ouch.  Lets him solidify right side territory.]
;B[lk]C[RickMott:  Why here?  You're forcing all right; forcing him to solidify his territory!  He should answer with N8 and be happy.]
;W[kg];B[lh]C[RickMott: forget that stone, it's of no value.  You need to jump again to M7 so you threaten to reduce his right territory and make something in the center using your left-side group.]
;W[hn]C[Critical This started whites progress into the middle

RickMott: You have a couple of interesting replies.  Because he made a 2-space jump, which may be a bit of an overplay given the weak connection between his corner and the bottom stones, you could try starting a fight with H4 or J4.  You will either cut off 72, cut off the stone at L3 and get more territory out of your corner, or reduce his bottom territory substantially. He can't protect everything.]
;B[hl]C[RickMott: by trying to enclose everything, you enclose very little.  Consider F7 or F8, which reduce the aji of C7 and enlarge your side in a more defendable way.]
;W[gm]C[RickMott: walking through the open door.];B[no];W[oo]
;B[lo];W[nn];B[mn]C[I think this was not the best move. Something like m7, m6, or threatening to cut the white centre group off.

RickMott: acually, from where you are now, I would think about L14 followed by K14 to try and salvage something in the center, but it's a long shot.  Hard to make enough territory now. You still have the sente corner reduction in the upper left. And you really ought to capture C7 for real sometime.]
;W[mm]C[RickMott: but he responded locally, which was a  mistake, so you still have a chance to get to a big point first.]
;B[ln];W[lm];B[em]C[To prevent c7 comming into things

RickMott: Good.];W[fl];B[dl]C[RickMott: can be at E8 instead.  There's no risk of white escaping.]
;W[jl];B[jj]C[RickMott: must be at J10 instead.  He'll walk through the door (which he does).]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[hk];B[hj];W[fj]C[RickMott: no more chance to make any territory in the center.  Your only hope is a big reduction in the upper left corner and upper side.]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[kf]C[to take L13 out of the picture];W[le];B[jg]
C[RickMott: extending at K14 is stronger.];W[gj];B[hi];W[fh]
;B[hg];W[be]C[RickMott: he got there first.  Now you really don't have much of a chance.]
;B[bf];W[ce]C[Is the 3,3 point still worth going after?b15 was quite big I think. I had forgotten my original intention with c5

RickMott: right, you had to attack this corner in sente much earlier.]
;B[go];W[fp];B[fo];W[gp];B[ho]C[I feel I should of been able to invade the lower left terriotry at some stage. Now I can't]
;W[mk];B[kl];W[km];B[hd]C[RickMott: good move, probably best reduction available.]
;W[gc];B[og];W[nf];B[hc];W[ic];B[ie]C[I was happy with this penetration WOuld of been better if I had the top left corner

RickMott: instead of the diagonal at J15, push through one more at H18.  You need BIG reductions.]
;W[ke];B[jf];W[mb];B[nb];W[md];B[nc];W[lb];B[hb]C[RickMott: Ok, you got it anyway.]
;W[ib];B[gb]C[RickMott: The monkey jump at E19 would be more effective.]
;W[fb];B[gd]C[RickMott: small move.  The placement at E17 is interesting.  If white connects, you play E18 and threaten to connect underneath, then 3-3.  Verrrrrru interesting.  not sure it'll work, but you need to take chances now.

E14 would also expand your side territory.];W[fc];B[fe]C[RickMott: E14 still better, but you can't make up enough.]
;W[ei];B[dh];W[dj];B[cj];W[ee];B[ff]C[Black is too far behind now I feel. The cut at k5 is not really effective since white can link up with his territory on the right edge. I feel as though I might of made up some points in the end game, but that is another story.

Thanks Shaun.

RickMott: A couple of general comments.  First, you tend to respond locally when you maybe should look for sente plays or big points elsewhere.  Second, when trying to enclose territory make sure the enclosing stones are no more than one line apart in each dimension.  Twice I saw you leave a diagonal splitting move, where a small or large knight's move would have prevented white from breaking through.

Attack weak groups first, before making territory.  You are more likely to get your territory in sente if you attack something -- not intending to kill it, just to get outside moves for free.

Hope all this helps you.  Good luck!];W[kk];B[kj];W[ll];B[rj]
