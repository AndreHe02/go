reviewee played white

This game was rather short, and most of the heavy action occured around a big fight in the middle. Both sides misread it multiple times, but white one more time than black. My biggest comments are: keep your stones connected, make better shape, and improve your reading for the game-deciding fights.]

(;W[dh]LB[ed:A]C[this move must be at A. black pushing there is unbearable, as you will later see. you chose a joseki where you gave black the corner. in return for this, you should get the outside. when black plays A, he has the corner and the outside, and you have two weak stones doing nothing.]
