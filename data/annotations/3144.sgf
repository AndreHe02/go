(;B[qn]CR[qq]C[Migeru: this is ok, but you are inviting white to strengthen his corner. Since white's 4-4 stone is high, it might be better for you to aim for a 3-3 invasion later]
;W[np];B[on]CR[pd][qn]C[To strengthen my attacking stone and build influence towards the center.

Migeru: think of this move as building influence upwards and building your side, not as building influence towards the center.]

(;B[cf]CR[ck]C[Migeru: note that white has a natural two-space extension towards your weak group, but is really too far away from your corner stone to crawl under it yet.]

(;B[cl]C[Migeru: you are now overconcentrated. Avoid contact plays when you are on the offensive.]
;W[dk];B[dl]C[In the following sequence, I want to make my group survive and reach out to possibly connect later.

Migeru: observe how white ourruns you towards the center, attacks from a distance, defends in contact, and keeps the initiative.]

[ql:2][rp:3]CR[on][qn]C[Migeru: Unlike on the opposite side, your marked stones are strong, so it is appropriate to press from the top at 1. Also, you can extend into white's corner at 3 after white does his natural 2-space extension at 2.]
;B[qg];W[ql]
(;B[nl]C[To make my stones survive, reach for influence in the center and towards my other group and to hinder white's influence from the side.

Migeru: your stones are not in immediate risk. A more aggressive capping move might be appropriate here.]
;W[oi];B[og];W[jc]CR[gc][mc]C[Migeru: White can extend nicely to either side. You have a choice from where to attack. Do it from your weaker side, pressing against your stronger side.]

(;B[lc]C[Migeru: you are attacking from your strong side. Always attack from the side opposite your strength.]
;W[gc]
(;B[fc]CR[ec]C[Migeru: contact plays are defensive. You should consider a capping play, or play at the marked point of you want to protect your corner.]
;W[gd];B[ef];W[eh]
(;B[gg]C[To avoid being enclosed and build influence in the center.

Migeru: influence radiates from walls. You re not building influence, but keeping white separated. It is good to avoid being enclosed, even if your group's life is not threatened.]
;W[qc]C[Migeru: Great timing for a 3-3 invasion.];B[pc]C[Migeru: good, pressing from your weaker side.]

;B[se]CR[pb];W[pb]C[I overlooked this. If I had placed my last stone here, white would have been dead in the corner, right? Killing White here, wouldn't have made the difference alone, though (as far as I count).

Migeru: It's amazing it took both of you so long to see that atari :-)]

Migeru: The biggest points on the board are the marked ones. What your move does is enclose white's right-side group.]
;W[pk];B[oj]CR[rp][qq]C[Migeru: this only strengthens white's group.]
;W[pj];B[ok];W[rh];B[qh];W[rj];B[sm]CR[rp][qq]C[I admit: I was curious, what that move would bring about. Should probably have been a bigger move, like M5 or H10?

Migeru: How are M5 or H10 "big"? Points are made on the corners and sides.]

Migeru: we are already in the endgame. Black is ahead. The marked points indicate the biggest boundary yet to be settled.]
;W[ap];B[an];W[bg]C[Migeru: White takes the initiative in the most valuable open boundary. Up to now the game was even, with a slight black advantage, but missing this move cost black at least 5 points.]

;W[ni];B[ph]C[Migeru: Missing O12 has cost black over 10 points. White was already ahead, though.]
;W[pi];B[nh]C[This stone on O10 would have diverted white to the other direction and I would have probably saved some points?

I often have problems with these "worms", which tend to destroy much of the territory, that seemed to be safe under my control.

Do you have advice against these "worms"?

Migeru: contain them from a distance, contact plays are ineffective.]
