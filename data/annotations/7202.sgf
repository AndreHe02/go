C[I play black. To me the game was too peaceful but i lost. Please help me. im am currently 17k on kgs and my opponment was 16k.


Hi,

my name ist Rainer (5k) and I did the review for this game.
(my comments are prefixed R:)

Generally, this was a good even game. Black made some unnecessary moves which White could take advantage of.

Basic hints for your future games:
- try to think on a larger scale during the opening
- attack weak stones
- always ask yourself, "Is this move necessary?" before placing a stone
- never push you opponents stones into your own moyo

I hope the comments I made in the game will help you in the future.

Have fun!

Rainer];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[nc]LB[oc:A][pj:B]C[is this a bad opening move? I dont have a reason behind it or anything...

R: The move is ok. It is easier to attack then the smaller shimari at A, but takes more space. It is normally played to make an extension towards B.]
;W[fc];B[jp]LB[pj:A]C[R: A move at A would be better.];W[pj]
CR[ph]C[R: Now an extension from the upper right shimari gets a bit crowded.]

(;B[dj]LB[ph:A][pl:B][fq:C]C[How else should have i responded?

R: Well, there are innumerous possibilities to respond to the move at Q10. A to C are just some of them.]

(;W[lc]LB[qn:A]C[R: Better to reinforce the stone at Q10 and attack.]

(;B[qh]LB[ph:A]C[R: A move at A would also be possible as it's better for access to the center.]

(;W[jc]C[R: Small move.]
(;B[cf]C[should i have pinched Q10 instead?

R: Yes, that would be better as your stone at D10 can get a base easily.]

C[maybe i should of pinched Q10 about now.....

R: Yes, that would have been big.];B[fq];W[qn]
(;B[ro]LB[qo:B][np:A][nq:C]C[R: Not good as you help to build a base for White. A move at A, B or C would be better.]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[rn];B[rp]C[S3 better?

R: No.];W[nq]
(;B[mq]LB[no:C][np:B][oq:A]C[I wasnt sure how to respond to this move.

R: Basic rule is, if you attack a stone, don't touch it, because it just gets stronger. In this case you have to worry about your corner group, so it would be better to play from this side, strenghtening this group or to go for the center.]
;W[np]
(;B[op]LB[oo:A]C[R: You have to try to keep White seperated.]
;W[oo];B[oq]LB[nn:A]C[R: White could connect with A now.]
(;W[nr]
(;B[or];W[mr]
(;B[lq]C[correct responce?

R: One stone is not very important. Where could you play to gain a lot? You could still try to cut the connection between the two white groups, weakening them.]
;W[lr];B[mo]C[R: Not good. If you want to cut, just do it.]
;W[no]
(;B[mm]LB[mn:A]C[R: The solid move is better.];W[nm];B[mn];W[nk]
;B[oi];W[lj];B[kk];W[lh];B[nh]LB[fm:A]C[i think this was a bad move... where else should i have gone?

R: A move around A perhaps to increase you moyo on the lower center?]
;W[jg];B[ef];W[gf];B[gg];W[hf];B[gh]LB[fm:A]C[dumb move again?

R: A move around A would be bigger.];W[ji];B[jj]LB[ij:A]C[R: A would be much better as you should stay ahead.]
;W[ii];B[ij];W[hi];B[gj]C[R: Not good, White could break through.]
;W[gi];B[fi];W[hj];B[gk]C[R: Now White can march into your moyo.]
;W[hk]
(;B[qj]LB[rj:A]C[R: It is more important to stop White from entering your moyo in the lower center. The attack move ought to be one line lower at A.]
;W[pi]
(;B[qi]LB[ph:A]C[R: Wrong side. Don't let White walk into your moyo.]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[ql];B[rl]TR[ph][hl][il]C[R: There are much more important moves now.]
;W[rm]C[R: White gives Black a chance to strengthen his defences as this move is very small.]
;B[ri]C[R: Wrong. Not necessary and therefore wasted. In the actual game it cost you around 20 points.]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[oh];B[ng]LB[og:A]TR[nh][oi]C[R: Don't try to rescue the two marked stones but secure territory with A.]

(;W[pe]LB[od:A]TR[ne][nf][ng][nh][oi]C[R: Wrong direction. A move at A could cut off the marked stones.]

;W[kj]C[i let this happen to prevent the invation, was it the wrong choice?

R: No, that was correct. But it would have been better to play that earlier.]
;B[kl]C[R: Too small. The left side of the moyo is still open.]
;W[lk]
(;B[em]LB[fm:A][fn:B]C[R: Good, but don't touch Whites stones. White can push you back.]
