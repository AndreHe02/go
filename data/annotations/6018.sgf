;B[qp];W[ce];B[ck]C[Was C9 a correct move? I'm not really good in fuseki.

----

A bit odd. It's better enclose a corner first or make an approach move.]
;W[qk]C[Another odd move ;) Same as before];B[kq]C[It's good to make your stones work together but this is still too ambitious. There's still room for invasion on both sides.]
;W[id]
(;B[ql]C[When you want to attack a single stone it's not common to attach to it. Attachment generates a lot of strenght for both sides which is often not good at this stage of the game. If you want to attack that stone see possible variations.

Anyway i don't think a direct attack on that stone is that urgent. Probablly it's better first to invade. Both corners are still open for invading and I feel that to be a better idea.]

;B[mj];W[lj];B[lk];W[kj]C[white is getting ahead];B[kk];W[pj]

(;B[il]C[Here I decided that without J8 move, the W group in the middle was not dead and could threaten the black groups in the center. Was I right? Sould I better make a move on C4 or somewhere there?




-------------

I can see understand your nervousness about the group in the center since you have a lot of cutting points but no one seems to work. It's urgent to reply in the corner and C4 is the correct answer. See variations before to see what can happen if white tries to live.]
;W[ak];B[al];W[aj];B[bl];W[ei];B[hk]C[I made a move here because otherwise white could move on G10

And so what? If white goes to G10 it has only 1 liberty and you can kill it ;) This move is higly inncesary. Invasion in the corner is urgent]

Yes ;)];W[hh]C[But white helps a lot :D :D :D]

It's been a very conservative game at the start. Then a lot of desperate moves were made. When dealing with that kind of moves you must remain calm and not try to kill all the stones in one stroke. Attaching is not often the proper way of attacking. You must first set up and then attack. 

Also the fuseki had little direction. 

I'd recommend you read something about direction and joseki from sensei's library or the book "opening theory made easy". Anyway the game had some really interesting fights but don't force yourself into complex fights try to make things simple.]
