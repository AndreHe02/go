;B[dj];W[qf];B[pi];W[nc];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]C[In this position  white and black has a "common defect" in the walls  they built at  Q15 and R15. The player who plays first can defend against this by playing  into the "hole"
in the opponents wall and in the same time create a cutting point. At this  stage white do not
want to play Q18 because that would make black thicker so black does not want  to defend
against Q18 now. Black should play R15 in sente then extend the wall to the  stone at Q11 with
bQ13.]
(;B[pb];W[pe];B[oe];W[qe];B[lc]C[Now white can play P13 making miai of  attacking Q11 and using the aji  of wP16 somehow.
Even if P16 is not possible immediately black is overconcentrated with bad  aji compared
to the position when black plays the correct joseki with R15 instead of Q18.]
;W[od]
(;B[oc];W[nd];B[nb];W[mb];B[mc];W[na];B[ob];W[qb];B[lb];W[me];B[mf]C[It look better to play P13 instead ignoring the white stones. The  stone at q11 is more
important and the feeling is that P13 swallows the four white stones in a  deep sea of
blackness.
P13 is the vital point both players have ignored. It is important because it  connects/cuts depending on who plays it.]
;W[og];B[md]C[White plays the vital point P13 in sente and has already played R18  in sente. It looks  like black have devastated white but counting the profit in white corner and  blacks profit  on the upper side the result is equal. White have the aji(good taste) of  wO15 bO14 wM15
later so the black position is not as thick as it looks like. Q11 is weak  stone and  white have sente.]
;W[cc]C[Black should try to get sente now and save his weak stone at the  right side.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be]
(;B[cf];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec]C[F17 is  better because it now white can play E19 in sente (2-point  loss).]
;W[bf];B[cg];W[jf]C[This look like an overplay. It is to deep and  white has other good  plays anyway. White  let black take the initiative.]
;B[le];W[id];B[ie]C[Good way of using thickness];W[je]C[
 Henrik 22k*: YAY!];B[jc]C[
 Henrik 22k*: Ops. flat. =)
bad way of using thickness . White cannot capture K16 because of the black  strength nearby.
Black should play j14 instead aiming att maximum territory and making Wk14-15  heavy.]
;W[if];B[he];W[jj];B[ep]C[This point is always good but after K10 Q11 is  weaker than ever, so  black should defend Q11
Proverb: Play urgent points before big points.];W[gq];B[gp]C[

This is a move a don't know anything about. It look playable but I cannot say  if it is
good, ok or bad.];W[fp];B[fo];W[fq];B[hp]C[It is difficult to find a good  black move here perhaps is E5 better  (followed by w E3 and
b h4) and E3 is way to fight and attack the corner (but I do not think  black is strong
enough for that here).];W[eo];B[do];W[en];B[fn]C[If black plays D5 he has to connect at D4 immediately. If black want  to defend on the  outside it is better to play F6 first leaving the problems to white.]
;W[dn];B[kp];W[hn];B[go];W[ni]C[Normally one play on the side first then caps. But since white is  thin in the center and
has a lot of territory now this is probably safer.];B[ok];W[mq]C[White R8 is a similar move but looks more dangerous for black]
;B[lq]C[This move forces white to play n4 which weakens the black right side  group. It look better
to attach at N4 instead of M3];W[mp];B[hq];W[eq]C[This is perhaps not neccessary but if one is uncertain  this ok I  think, since now white
has a 100% safe corner];B[qh];W[qg];B[qm]C[...but attacking the black group first instead of e3 in  sente and  then play e3 would be
even better. So black should really be satisfied since he has secured two  weak groups now.]
;W[mg]C[This move is not sente];B[lf];W[gg];B[ff]C[This move is not urgent. (I think black has a tendency  to follow the  white player too much
in the endgame perhaps this a weakness to work on)];W[cl];B[ck]C[
 Henrik 22k*: jag e urusel pa sant haer.
 Henrik 22k*: (om du inte maerkt det an =)];W[gj];B[lg];W[mh];B[mk]C[Black is forcing white to connect his stones. It is  better to play  elsewhere or aggressively
try to cut white with M11 or M12. Black is perhaps 10 points behind so he  should play
a good endgime or start a fight.];W[lj];B[on]C[This move does not look very good. i think S6 or S5 and N2 is  bigger.  B8 is enourmous.]
;W[mn]C[This is only good if white can attack something thanks to it but  black can play N2 in that
case.];B[no];W[mo];B[op];W[oq]C[Blacks forcing moves at O5 and p3 are aji keshi,  (removes  potential) and should be  saved for later.
Now blacks shape is weak and the value of black n2 is lessened as is bS5]
;B[pp];W[qp]C[This move is worse than the previous since now S5 is clearly  impossibleand the shape is  worse.]

;B[bl]C[This is  very big. In this kind of shape White often has to defend  against C9 immediately,
but since white is strong he could leave it but it is still very big in sente  so to play
wB8 would have had the double value. Black should be very pleased to play  here.]

this instead of H2.];W[lr];B[kr];W[mr];B[ir];W[lk];B[gl];W[si];B[sj]C[Aha! An example where the  shape of T13 (compared to H1) is good. If  black plays like this  he risks a lot in ko and shoulf perhaps drawback to s10 instead. If this  fight is good for
black or white is difficult to judge since both risk a lot. But in this case  black risks
his whole group if white take the ko so this does not look good for black. As  we will se in
the end.];W[rj];B[sh];W[gf];B[ge];W[si];B[bd];W[bc];B[sh];W[pa];B[ne];W

This is a bad kothreat because after bC10 black threaten to play A12 and  capture three
white stones due to a lack of liberties];B[cj];W[si];B[ad]C[This is also a bad ko threat since now the three stones  cannot be  captured anymore...]

 Henrik 22k*: Increase brainlag's time by 10 minutes];B[ai];W[sk];B[qj]
C[A  typical bad ko for black. When white captures the ko black have no  time to follow up the
kothreat so black loses the ko in gote with the only compensation that white  probably will
defend against the kothreat later. It would have been better to play S10  instead of T10.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[qi];B[pj];W[ph]C[This move is not urgent at all because it  has nothing to do with  blacks eyeshape. White  should play S8 instead and kill black (that is bigger beleive...;-) )]
