C[Hi, my name is Maxime. I am about 6k. I will do my best to help you with simple tips.]
;B[qp];W[dd];B[dp];W[od]C[An aggressive move...Do take advantage of this moves special properties in the follow moves?

Max: I think this move aims to get the top. It concedes the corner to black if he wants it.]
;B[pc];W[pd];B[qd];W[qe];B[rd];W[oc];B[pb];W[re];B[rc];W[jd]
C[Max: Looks like a fair result.. However as white I may want to expand on the right because black still has some aji left around o18.]
;B[jp];W[pj]C[this move seems high... would R10 be more balanced?

Max: I don't know, it looks good.];B[cj];W[op]C[I wasn't sure exactly how to invade to I tried this out.]
;B[pq];W[oq];B[mq];W[pp];B[qq];W[qn];B[jj]C[Is this really as big as a move as it seems?  I really felt it was when I was playing!  What is the most mature way of looking at this situation?

Max: This move is going to help black in fights that run to the center. I think c3 and c14 are big right now.  You can poke his loose box shape later with moves like g10 and k7.]
;W[dh]C[Low would have been better?

Max: I am unsure about it , it may be alright.];B[ch];W[cg]
;B[ci];W[cn]C[Max: The  cut at d13 will be something to worry about. As b I would play very simply with f3.]

(;B[co];W[dn];B[fn];W[do];B[cp];W[eq]C[this might be a silly invasion.  I was trying to get stones in different points that could work together.

Max: Defintely overplay. :P];B[dq];W[ep];B[eo]C[but that is the problem!! now I have two weak groups...advice on how this invasion could have gone better?

Max: c3 is simple and it leaves a bit of room to harrass the "box" later.]

(;W[en]C[Max: Who does this help?];B[fo];W[gq]C[Max: Two split weak groups, danger. And the extension is narrow to my eye.]

(;W[hs];B[is];W[fs]C[I was lucky to live...a better player would have killed me!]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[eb]
(;W[gc]C[well placed? if I played E16 then I thought he would extend over to H17.

Max: The move may be good as an effort to make black run. You dont HAVE to try to kill every invasion, it is often a better option to offer small life. That way you could secure your top and make strenght to connect to later when you want to reduce black in the middle (he doesn't have anything yet by the way).]

(;B[gd];W[hd];B[fd];W[bq]C[Max: Good move.]
(;B[cq]
(;W[ao]C[this next invasion didn't work out.  where did I go wrong?]

(;B[bo];W[bn];B[ap];W[br];B[an];W[am]
(;B[ao];W[bm]C[I really thought I could kill his corner group but my capping group got beat here.  I didn't see the weakness of this group I guess.  I was playing a little too recklessly...how can I make my shape stronger and continue to put pressure on him?

Max: I think you missed the variation for move 76 that I suggested. I looked at it for 10 minutes before finding it, you can only run it seems to me.]
;B[bs];W[ar];B[em]
(;W[dl];B[ek];W[el];B[fl];W[dk];B[dj];W[ej];B[fk];W[ei]C[I now thought that I could get his C10-12 group and save my B6 stones??]
;B[ck];W[bk]C[I now saw I was low on liberties!  How to salvage this situation?

Max: One idea could be to try to get enough liberties to kill black in the corner with the bulky five dead shape before he kills you. If you play a3 before him you will kill him, given enough liberties.]

;W[df];B[hc];W[ic];B[hb];W[gb]C[this stone seems to be a waste.  playing at J18 or J16 might be better?]
;B[ib];W[jb];B[he];W[id];B[hg]
(;W[hh];B[ig];W[ge]C[these next two move only strengthen him??

Max: This is good.];B[gf];W[fe];B[ff];W[ee];B[ih];W[gh];B[ef]

(;W[lg]C[the moves until 174 seem to be natural and safe..I got a lot of territory fairly easily it seems...where is the weakness in my thought process?

Max: Move 124? For one thing you don't ask for enough. L13 makes it easier to connect with k16 and is making your potential bigger. But most importantly theres a connection]

Max: Not now but earlier theres was something to be done. I have put a variation at mv212.]
;W[rb]C[Max:  Good job.];B[sb];W[ra]C[Now please help me on this top right corner because I had no idea these two moves would save the game for me.  it seems they are all alive in seki so there was no points scored, correct?  R and T 17 are dame points, which don't count for either person.  Also please advise me on the basics of using seki in this way as a strategy.  I've never though of looking to create seki when the situation won't allow a kill.

Max: Interresting situation, it is rare. Black made bad shape in the first place.]
