AB[pd][dp]C[I learned the rules about a month ago and this is about my 25th game on IGS. After winning about 4 games but with very bad and loose play and losing the rest my rank is 17k? I have read 3 or 4 beginner books in these 4 weeks and in this game (I am black) I managed to avoid really gross errors as far as I can see (which isn't very far!). However I would like to know whether my crawling around with stretch type moves which happens a lot here is totally wrong or maybe just partially wrong? My opponent gave away 2 stones which seems a bit harsh as he/she is16k+ but I wasn't complaining. This is the first server game I have played that would feel I could show someone - not because I won but because I think it will highlight what weaknesses I should be working on. Thank you very much for looking at this game and for your time.

Hey there! You're doing well for someone who's just learnt the rules a month ago. Good to see getting some practice alongside with the more theoretical stuff in books. (Books are good, but no replacement for real experience.) Good on you for utilising GTL!

I'll be going through the game and highlighting 2-3 major points that I think can help you improve your game. There'll be minor points along the way, such as alternate moves or noting that X move wasn't necessary and then some options available at that time. But the main message will come through again and again as variations of these situations prop up.]

(;B[ce]C[Up until here, B's groups (calling C15 and D17, and C3-D4-F4 groups even though they aren't directly connected) have been strong and well-defended. 

But C9 looks a bit lonely and endangered by nearby strong W group.
D17 is a single stone too, and while making the knight's move shape in the corner is a strong move for securing some corner terrtory, B has more urgent moves to play. 

W's B8 attack on C9 needs to be answered. Although B8 and C9 aren't directly adjacent, a diagonal is still counted as an attack. (From now on called 'contact moves'.)]
;W[cl];B[dk];W[lp]C[M4 is foreboding for B.  B's  D4 group isn't settled, and doesn't quite have a base in which to make two eyes.]

(;B[cj]C[i often seem to be thinking during a game that I should stop something happening - here stop white separating at C10 but then I think that the solution creates another problem - here I have created the empty triangle - is it usual to have to choose between principles and how do you reconcile them? if this is a dumb or unanswerable question plaease ignore.

C10 doesn't need to be connected immediately, there's a strong enough connection with D10. If W does cut, then B's got all his friendly stones nearby to abuse W's bravado. ;)
Not a dumb question at all! I spent a great deal of time at your strength pre-emptively avoiding empty triangles. The trick is to make good shape, which naturally forms strong connections, which then very rarely necessitate formation of emtpy triangles. Good shape comes with practice. There are some books out there about making good shape, but those are fairly advanced.]

You can abandon some, but not all. I think D4 group still have some potential in it, even if you just use it as bait to attack H3.]

(;B[ek]C[again I seem to be very aware of the need to be cautious and look to link up again.

Connecting is always good, I'd rather you be overly cautious than reckless. But connection doesn't always need to be a direct connection, as long as you can see a way to connect out, then that is good enough. Again, that comes with more experience. You'll get a feel for it, as well as develop reading skills to read out a connection (or failure to connect, as the case sometimes may be.)]

Yuuuup. Hm, if you can see where the creeping is going, you can step back and play a little ways from local situation, and then close in.
Creeping happens a lot during the first hundred games, but you'll learn how to 'travel' across the board faster with one-space jumps and knight moves, as well exert influence using walls.
you'll also learn that sometimes responding to creeping moves isn't worth a lot of points and that there are bigger moves to be made. Let them creep along all they like while you take bigger moves!]

You generally don't need  to put 'space-filling' stones in your own territory to deter your opponent if your territory walls are solid enough. if W invades, kill W. W here doesn't have enough eyespace, not enough space to make a base (hey, that rhymes) so killing is easy. No need to worry.]
