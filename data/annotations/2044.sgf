C[I felt that this was a really fun interesting game. I made a lot of mistakes with a capture race near the center and in the lower right, but overall I felt I played decent but I would really like to know what I am doing wrong, good, and what i can do better to improve.

I would have to say that for this review, don't try to remember specific moves, think of the ideas I suggest, such as looking at the whole board situation. It might be good after you go through the review once to go back through the game again, and think of a better move for each turn. If you have any more questions about the game or anything e-mail me at vze32jd6@verizon.net.  Also, check out Sensei's Library and goproblems.com, they are good sites. Also, looking at other peoples reviews games off of GTL and thinking of better moves is good.
-Andrew];B[pd];W[cd];B[pp];W[dq];B[ed];W[ec]C[A better move might have been at D17 if you want to protect the corner, or even better to extend to the left edge. See var.]
;B[dc];W[dd];B[fc]C[This is not good for white, they have a worse chance of keeping the corner, and now black has some strength towards the top.]
;W[eb];B[db];W[fd];B[ee];W[fb]C[G17 would be better];B[gc];W[ge]
C[There are bigger moves on the board then saving that one stone. For example on the left side, on the bottom, invading the right side at or around r10. An invasion at N3, or N17. Always look at the whole board situation then then the small fights.]
;B[fe];W[gd];B[gb];W[da]C[This move does very little, again the whole board situation.]
;B[ca];W[ea];B[fa]
(;W[jp]C[I would suggest a more aggresive move around N3. See var.]
;B[do];W[dm]C[A move here will mean that it will be very hard to keep the corner. I would suggest a move at F4. Not only will this play off your other two stones, but it will stregthen you bottom group. Remember the Go Proverb, Your best move is usually your opponents best move.]
;B[fp];W[gn];B[cm];W[cl]C[Perhaps a move at F3 could give you a chance for a group in the corner.]
;B[cn];W[dl];B[gp];W[fn]C[This move does little, perhaps a stone at d11 or d12, this would give you strength on the left side.]
;B[bp];W[cp];B[dp];W[bo];B[cq];W[co];B[eq];W[dr]C[This fight is very hard, and there are bigger points on the board, you have yet to invade his territory. Still a move at D11 or D12 will work.]
;B[cr];W[bq];B[cs];W[ap];B[br];W[dn]C[Good move there to cut the opponent.]
;B[en];W[bm]C[It would be better to expand instead of capture this group. These two black stones are dead no matter what they do.]
;B[em];W[bn];B[el]
(;W[bl]C[Again, expansion this does little. See var.];B[ce]
;W[be];B[bd]
(;W[de]C[Sacrifice two stones to get more. See var.];B[df];W[cf]
;B[ae];W[af];B[bc];W[ad];B[ac];W[ce]C[Again, extend into the left this will do little and is bad shape, these stones are in no immediate danger.]
;B[cg];W[ef];B[dg];W[ff];B[ec];W[bg];B[ch];W[bh];B[ae];W[eo]
;B[ep];W[ad];B[bi];W[ah];B[ae];W[bf]C[This move will almost surley seal the fate of this group. If you had continued with the ko fight two eyes might have been possible.]
;B[ai];W[ad];B[cc];W[od]LB[nc:a][qf:b][nq:c][qn:d]C[A better invasion point would be at A, B, C, or D. or even one step further away from the black stone would work too.]
;B[oc];W[oe];B[pe];W[nc];B[pb];W[nb];B[kd];W[ds]C[This group is dead, focus on the fight at hand. There are bigger points.]
;B[er];W[fo];B[hp];W[ob];B[qc];W[ci];B[cj];W[di];B[fg];W[bj]
C[Good move, always look for a combo like that near the edges.]
;B[ae];W[aj];B[ad];W[bi];B[ck];W[eg];B[id];W[dh];B[gf];W[gg]
;B[fh];W[hf];B[hg];W[gf]C[This move is very passive, continue on the attack.]

;B[im];W[ej]C[To passive.];B[fj];W[fi];B[gh];W[ig]C[There are still big moves all on the right side, r10.]

C[Always be careful of your nearby groups.];B[kj];W[li];B[kk]
;W[jj];B[jh];W[lh];B[gm];W[pa]C[Still biggest points are on the right side.]
;B[qa];W[oa];B[pg];W[rb]C[This move only forces your opponent to move at r18, and makeing this stone dead. Forcing moves are bad, since they close options in the future. For example, with a black stone now at r18, you can no longer move at q17 and put his stones in risk, which could lead to a capture later in the game.]

;W[qg];B[rg];W[qh];B[rh];W[qi];B[ri];W[qj]C[This sequence of stones will do little. Don't throw in a bunch of stones and lose em just to save one stone. Cut your loses and lose jsut one and make a better move.]

;B[oc];W[tt];B[pc]C[Mainly I would say to take away from this game are a few things:

Your best move is usually your opponents move.

Always look on the whole board situation. Not so much the local small group, althought also important.

With each stone you place, try to make them work off previous stones.]
