C[hi~

Please tell me which moves of W are not good and where should be played instead.

Thank you very much~


one thing that you consistently do is 'attack' stones before you make a base. When you do this all you do is make them strong and give them good moves against you later.

You do it on the left early and then on the top after f17

if you do this you are effectivley saying i dont want territory and i want to run which is exactly what you dont want to be saying

place a stone
make a base
move into center 

then the attack will be there very naturally.


why am i reviewing a game you won? There is FAR more to say to help your opponent]

it will end up sacrificing a piece and giving her an eye or loose the corner.

make sure one or the other happens ... if you give the eye then you will loose a lot of your strength and influence.

your right, but i think its necessary

f17 isnt a great idea.


I can see why youve played it. It is hard to find something else now.


but can you see that it has gotten rid of some of the corner aji (d14 @ c14 would be better for b)

and it has made b secure his top group?

something has gone wrong much eariler on.

I think this corner is the key to this game. It was goign to be difficult from very early on.]

play some variations out .. but top right will be a problem

You cannot play this move and so you have to come up with a strategy to control how much territiry b will get here.
