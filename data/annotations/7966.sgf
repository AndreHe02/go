AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,

first of all, thanks for taking times to review this. 3k is an average level as I often win against 1 or 2k, sometimes 1d and can lose against "weaker" player. It may be because I'm weaker with white but not really sure about that. A sure thing is that I don't really know how to deal with handi games. I don't ask comments on b moves, just concentrates on w. Where should I have been faster? Must I try to trick my opponents? Or if it was just ok but b didn't make enough mistakes for losing this game (we must count on it with 6 stones)

Thanks and hope you'll have a little fun with this game.

Hi Florian, I am usagi on KGS. It is difficult to review a handicap game because white should make unreasonable plays, and it is not proper to reccomend that you play something unreasonable. However, perhaps I can find a mistake black made which you did not seize upon? Actually I have been playing a lot of h6 and h5 games on KGS recently. The takeaway I have is that white has to play only borderline unreasonable moves and wait for his opponent to make a mistake. The other thing I find with h5 and h6 is that my opponent often makes wild, gambling-style moves. If I think calmly and read it out, I can almost always crush him by outreading him.

Anyways let's take a look.];W[nc];B[pf]LB[fc:A][qh:B]C[-----

usagi: 'A' is pretty standard, although if you are a star point expert or want to see their strength right away you can try 'B' as well. No biggie, 'A' is fine.]
;W[fc];B[df];W[jd]C[-----

usagi: Personally I think that in a 6h game this might be too slow. Just approach another corner. You have to fight it out, yes, but keep in mind you're six stones stronger.]
;B[hc]LB[gd:B][hd:C][fe:A]TR[df]C[-----

usagi: A is bad because black already has the marked stone.
I think B is too easy for black.
You should remember the 'C' sequence. I think it's best here. If black goes for the ladder, you can play a ladder breaker as your consolatoin, or give up the one stone and jump into the corner later.]
(;W[fe];B[gd]LB[cc:B][fd:A][ee:C]C[-----

usagi; if A was too slow, I've included some other variations which help you settle down.

unfortunately the damage has been done here. the real mistake was earlier. Now you just want to settle down and chip away at the H stone advantage.]

usagi; funny story, I prefer 'B' here. Or C, if you think he doesn't know the ladder variation.]
(;W[jb];B[kc];W[ib];B[hb]LB[fa:B][jf:A]TR[jd]SQ[kc][lc][hf]
[hg]C[-----

usagi: 'A' looks slack to me because you have the connection tesuji at 'B'. The marked stone has already cut or attacked black's two marked groups and o17 can jump into the corner to live, or attack black's 2 stones. So that o17 stone is fine for now. So I prefer 'B' which simplifies the situation a little.]

usagi; In the end I wouldn't have gotten involved in those large running battles. I would have tried to settle down faster and attack the weak groups. I think you missed a couple connection tesujis and obviously that life and death on the left, and those 2 or 3 issues cost you a game you could have won by 40+ instead :)

Good luck!])

usagi; and so I don't think the ladder sequence was good. The other variation where you just connect at k17 yourself is better. But it's good to be aware of the ladder variation.

There is a lot of tricky study you need to know to understand the ladder variation. You should look into it. There's a few other good lines of play there for w and b from pro games.]
