AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Mark: I'm about 7-8 kyu on KGS, while Pete is around 12-14 kyu on KGS.  We play in person on a regular basis, with Pete recently taking a larger handicap.  I've just recently started learning joseki.

I'm mostly concerned about my opening moves and especially how to handle the upper left, but have made comments throughout the first two thirds of play.  My opponent would also appreciate any words of advice.

Dear Mark,
I have found some patterns taken from the book Handicap Go of Nihon Kin, which unfortunately are more for higher skills. However they are good reference patterns. Since handicap games are based on the fact that one player is much stronger than the other, this is difficult to achieve without experience. I wrote some guidelines too. But I have seen many reading mistakes from both sides in the middle and endgame. I hope this review helps, sincerely,
Alberto];W[nc];B[pf]
(;W[qc]C[Mark: I've been trying this joseki a lot recently, since it gives me access to the corner.  (Corners, side, center....).  However, it sometimes means that my corner groups have little influence on the wider board.

A: This is not a proper joseki, it is an early invasion to the corner. Since black has already 4 stones on the board, invading too soon helps him get stronger on the outside as you said.]

(;B[lc]LB[nd:A]C[in this situation, this stone is really doing much. I show two good points. I thought at once that K16 is better as it keeps the good harmony with the overall position and is also joseki. If intended to protect the shape of the wall, the  correct move would be O16, but it is a little slow in the opening.]
;W[fc]C[Mark: I decide to approach the left with the possibility of using the stone at O17 later.]

(;B[dc]C[this looks a little too slow and tight for black.
To claim the star points means that you want to play developing the outside in exchange for W to invade the corner. W won't invade too early in the corner until is prepared from the outside.]
;W[ic]C[Mark: Okay, beyond this move, I don't have much of a sense of how to respond to the iron pillar at D17.  That move (as far as I can tell) is not common joseki, so I think there is something I can do, but I don't know what.

A: this seems natural for w, I think it's good too
The black wall on the right seems neutralized now and black can always be invaded in the corner from the lower side still at some point later.]
;B[le]LB[jp:A][ch:B][cf:C]C[A: I think b14 is not good enough. The  wall is for making thickness for fighting W and making territory elswhere and not made to make territory, and B14 does'nt really impede the potential of W1.

B could play in any place now, A is a large point for black, B protects a bit the corner against white's invasion at C. They are my first options now instead of black 14 now.]
;W[nq];B[kq];W[qq]C[Mark: Here's one of those responses where I get corner life, but pretty small.

A: you could try another pattern here, there is a proverb that apples here: avoid book moves. Invading here makes it easy game for W.]

(;B[qp]LB[qj:A]C[

wrong blocking direction, black should protect from the lower side, the wall is less effective and white gets a good chance to lead the game. If black had a stone in A it still would have been good to block from the side of black16.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[oq];B[np];W[qj]C[
this works perfect for W.];B[cj]
(;W[ce]C[Mark: So I try a low approach, but then flounder.  After I move, I see that a black extension to C13 puts a lot of pressure on white.

A: this is too close to blacks stones, and is affectin the stones on the upper side. But depending on blacks reaction I wouldnt judge it as bad.]
;B[de]C[Mark: And I'm clueless here.  I don't see any help from invading at C18 and I don't see that crawling on the third line helps me much given the stone at C10.  So I tenuki, hoping that soemthing else will appear later on.  It doesn't :-<.

So, there are some proverbs for white in handi games:
1) be patient, don't expect a quick victory
2) secure territory whenever you can
3) make light moves on blacks sphere of influence
4) Force black to make overconcentrated shapes
5) don't be afraid to sacrifice
6) exchange terrirories freely
7) make contact moves to create complications
8) leave positions undefined as long as possible
9) play flexibly and develop quickly]
(;W[qg]C[

A: this move does not look good enough. I think white should have tried to upset black on the upper left corner instead.]

(;B[ko]C[

A: for black E10 is larger];W[ej]C[Mark: Okay, I've seen game where if black gets this move, it creates an extremely strong side.  So I cap.  However, that leaves a floating group that black harasses to good effect.

A: good point, it flattens black moyo and prepares invasion on the corner.]

(;B[dh]
(;W[dl]C[A: there is another sequence for invading the side]
;B[cm];W[fl];B[fn];W[io];B[jm];W[cq]C[Mark: Another attempt to take the corner.  It works (although I think Pete could kill it at some points), but again I have very small life

A: the problem with the timing of this invasion now is that black can only profit from it.  Even if w lives in the corner, black is already connected outside and the weaker white groups become an easy target for capturing.]

(;B[cp]C[A: a mistake for black, it allows White to connect to the side and saves the group.]

(;W[dq]C[A: this is a huge mistake in the corner invasion sequence from white.]
;B[er];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[ep];W[dr]C[w lower left corner is not alive]
;B[cl];W[dk]
(;B[hl]LB[gm:A]C[this is too loose, white can connect later at A]
;W[gj]
(;B[fi]
(;W[br]C[Mark: I see an invasion at the 1-2 point killing the group, so I protect.

are you sure W lives here?]

;B[ek];W[el];B[hg];W[ik];B[in];W[hn];B[jo];W[ip]C[Mark: Would making the atari at J7 be better?

A: I think black could kill the white group in the lower side anyway. If not, then it would be strong enough to kill the group in the lower left corner]
;B[hm];W[kk];B[hd]
(;W[id];B[he];W[kb];B[lb];W[pg]C[Mark: Okay, this move sets up white's biggest territory and end up securing life for the G9 group.  But I end up losing all of the upper left corner.

A: I don't agree with this move];B[hc]C[A: bigger than W83]
