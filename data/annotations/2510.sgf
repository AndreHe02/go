C[Dear reviewer,

I played this game as White against a friend of me, we regulary play together, usually on a handicap of 4 stones which gives a good win/loss rate. We played this game even just for the fun of it, and I lost. :)
Blacks rank is 9k KGS, the 14k on IGS are not confirmed.

However, the game was interesting and we both did a couple of mistakes, especially I (white) overlooked a ladder in the middle game after which I basically should have resigned. Something went wrong in my attack on the black invasion on the left side. If possible, I would appreciate some hints my attack could have been more effective.

If possible, please review for both sides, as Cirrion is interested in the review, too.

Many thanks,

 Peter

n - I'll do my best.  It was an interesting game...both of you played well, I felt.  B had a particularly good sense of the whole game, but played some slow moves.  The whole game wins :)]

n - I think it's interesting.  Let's see what happens...];B[ci]
;W[dj]MA[el]C[n - This seems maybe a bit too direct.  I think W should build strength with X first.]
;B[dh];W[fh]MA[cj]C[n - This is quite a difficult shape...the key is to start with X I think.]

(;B[ei];W[fk];B[ef]MA[di]C[n - B is inviting W to cut!];W[fd]
;B[gf];W[fn];B[gp];W[cg];B[dg]C[n - The W shape is very thin in the middle.]

[ik:b]C[n - This is a slow move.  Now you have traded your thinness for heaviness.  How about A, which makes shape, or B, which leaves potential to attack the corner?]

;B[jo];W[io];B[jm]MA[jq]C[n - This move is unnecesary, you can play X]
;W[jq];B[kq];W[in];B[lm]C[n - Now W is in trouble, because you have two weak groups, and you cannot afford to sacrifice either one, or the B group comes back alive.]
