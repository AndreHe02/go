I won just because of a mistake by White at move 263

Olof: Hi. I hope you will find my review helpful. English is not my primary language but I hope you can stand all the spelling errors.]

(;W[ic]LB[db:A][ec:B]TR[cc][dc][id][jd][cj][dj]C[ah ... he didn't follow the joseki (not that I know it) -- before his move he should exchange A for B,
so I want to punish him ... but how??????

Olof: Playing at A is one of many possible joseki. Recently the koreans has found a very nice followup for black if white plays A (starting with G17). This has almost removed A from korean pro play. Some of the more usual josekis at this point include all the marked spots and A

J17 at this point is as I said above joseki but it does have a weakness. See the var.

Also see two vars of G17 (there are several more)]

Olof: Instead of thinking so much about terr you should think more about groups. Identify your weak groups and strengthen them, then identify his weak groups and attack them. The points will come by them self. Gain points in attacking (and I don't mean by killing stones). It is good to stay ahead and not push from behind but you need to make sure you will not become weak then you jump ahead. You made the same misstake two times (lower left corner and right side). And this more or less cost you the game.]
