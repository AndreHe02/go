;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[cn];W[co]LB[dj:A]C[prana: normally this move is only played, when there is already a white stone around A]
;B[dn];W[fq];B[cj]LB[dj:A]C[prana: better A];W[nc]LB[fc:A][ic:B]
[qf:C]C[T: Maybe here an approach to the other (open) corner?
Or is this playable also...
prana: I would prefer A, B or C];B[oc]LB[jd:A]C[prana: Like in the bottom corner this is unusual without a black stone around A]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jc]TR[oc][nd]C[prana: good exchange for w];B[hc]
C[T: For me black looked fragile... but...
prana: the black extension is far, thus the stones are thin.]
;W[je]C[prana: solid move];B[he]C[T: after I made my position very strong, she (?) had a huge moyo.
prana: it is a moyo, but you can reduce it. So, don't worry too much.]
;W[qn]LB[qh:A][di:B]C[prana: very slow. I would prefer A or B. These are more active moves, they give pressure to your opponent. R6 gives no pressure, it just takes some teritory.]
;B[kq]LB[dg:D][ig:B][hh:A][fj:E][gn:C][gp:F]C[T: for black I would have played F11 or E 10?
prana: I agree. It would be better to expand the mojo. There are plenty of possibilities to do so.]
;W[ej]LB[di:A]C[prana: I would play shoulder hit A];B[dj]LB[dh:A]
C[prana:  A is the usual answer];W[fh]LB[eh:A]C[prana: normal move is A]
;B[eg];W[gd]C[prana: good!];B[hd];W[fg];B[ef];W[ff];B[fe]C[T: but now, I did not seem to have much.
 A wall... but it seems too heavy to be good.

prana: the white group is fine. you wanted to reduce the black mojo, right? that is what it does]

(;W[eh]C[prana: better cut at g15 (which is the follow up of your peep)]
;B[ge]
(;W[dg]C[prana: overplay. Can be cut.
This might be considered as  your 1. losing move.];B[dh];W[di]
;B[ch];W[ci];B[bi];W[ei];B[bg]C[the black corner is really huge now (nearly 50p!)
prana: Furthermore the f12 group is a bit heavy (no eye space)]
;W[bl]C[T: maybe too early. I didn´t go on to play there, so my moves seem inconsistant.
prana: You can play it as a test move (kikashi) to see how white answers.]
;B[dl]
(;W[pj]LB[qh:A][fl:C][bn:B]C[prana: the f12 group is weak now, I would do sth to help them.
Q12 is a big point, but IMHO not the best, because it gives no pressure to our opponent.]
;B[ek];W[jh]C[T: If I can´t save the stones easily, then at least take aji from them. Or, if the opponent lets me save them, I am happy.
prana: You should defend th f12 group. It is too big to give it away.]
;B[hh];W[hi];B[ii];W[ih];B[hg]
(;W[ij]C[prana: giving away 8 stones for the ponnuki in the center? Brave decision, but I clearly would prefer black now.]
;B[gi];W[hj];B[gj]C[T: could I have played the sequence better?
...
So, for the rest of the game, it is especially interesting wich of the furikawaris (exchange of points/territory) are good and which are bad.

prana: black has a solid lead now. It will be hard to catch up for white.]

(;B[jp]C[T: he cut here, so this is becoming a really huge Ko, I think 38 points...
prana: To cut is overplay. This is the 1. big mistake of black.]

(;W[hk];B[jl]C[T: The score estimator tells me, my exchange was good.
BUT -

It is also important: did she play the followup correctly?
Would there have been a better way to play this for me?
... and still saving my group?

prana: you mean the exchange of 5 stones against 12 stones?
black made a series of serious faults, she lead more than 30p. Nearly all of it is gone now.]

Tokee [3k\]: thank you


.... so close;
I feel like...
with a good endgame I should have won.

thanks for reviewing!
greetings,
Tokee aka Stefan

prana: In this game white had a huge advantage in the middle game (>30p!).
You did a good job in catching up, but the gap was too large.
You lost the game in the early stage, not in the endgame.])
