I received your game on 25/Jan/2004 8am. And here the review of your game, I will make appropriate comment under kklim>, and those inside [\] is [chinese unicode\] for key term.

Thanks.];W[dp];B[pd];W[dd]C[kklim> black and white is standard double star (hoshi/xing) fuseki opening [二连星布局\]. Aim for speed and influence to the center should be the key driven or serve as joban plan (beginning phase) [序盘战略\].]
;B[qj]LB[fc:A][cj:B][fq:C][jc:D][jq:E][pj:F]C[kklim> personally, I think beside black 5, A to F is also can be consider. But thinking for you play as black (has the komi burden, you should play aggressive. So I think maybe A, C for closure approach white corner is more proactive; or F for 3 star opening; E or D for extend to the side; even B to divide can be consider. All up to your plan.

Personally I think black 5 is a bit of reactive, but it is fine right now, since it also depend on your opponent reaction.]
;W[fc]LB[nc:A][jc:B][nq:C][jp:D][dj:E][cj:F]C[kklim> for star fuseki, white should aim for extend to the side star, then closure the corner. If the white 4 is the komoku/xiaomu (3-4) then this is proper move.]
;B[cn];W[fp]
(;B[cj]LB[ck:A][dk:B][bp:C]C[kklim> personally think black 9 is overplay, 1 stone extend 3 space, too weak and cannot defend. If I'm white i will invade to take the opportunity of this weak move, like the variation branch 1. Advise play on variation branch 2.

If really want to extend, A is better, and stable. B can play as well if at the upper corner you have black stones. But for this situation, C is more proper move to divide the corner territory.]

(;W[cg]C[kklim> if white want to push, i think C12 will be better. But for me see the situation, at the bottom left corner, both white and black is still not yet stable (not yet able to live, if get attack\], so the priority is to either get life or attack and surround at the same time.]

;B[po];W[or];B[qs];W[no];B[mq]C[>      Is it B25 is not a good move compare to P7?

kklim> if just compare B25 and P7, P7 is relative better, as white if runaway to the center, along the way will build "influnece". Even I no sure white player can utilise "influnece" or not. But "seal" white into corner or side is better.]

kklim> personally I think compare move 59 and M18, move 59 is ok, since white is live minimal at the side, and you "seal" them already.]

C[>      In Move 106 should black secure his lower area or is it safe enough?

kklim> personally black group at the bottom is live shape already, can leave to play at the yose/guanzi/end game phase [官子\].]
;B[io]C[kklim> this move is a bit small, at the current situation, do you intend to play elsewhere have a better territory gain?]

kklim> as up to move 129, white already capture sansan(3-3) [三三\], personally i think it is no possible, further more, white group at there is life shape already. If continue play, I think reduce white group territory at the center is much more make sense.

Overally, white during yose phase is more proactive, using sente (first move) well, as you can see during end game, black is react to the white move, and loss a lot of point. I think black should build yose skill.

Hope my personal comment may help. Thank you.
