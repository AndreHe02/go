C[Hi,

I'm Jan, known as PeatMan on IGS. (and on KGS but I seldom play there.)
Thanks for commenting my game.  I'm particularly interested in strategic issues: Weak groups, strong groups, where to attack or when to defend. Or maybe according to you that is less relevant and I might improve more working on.... (whatever aspect.)

I played black and lost the game with 1.5 point.

J: Hi, my name is Jay (3k), and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments start with a "J:"]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[jd];W[dj];B[jp]TR[gq][mq]MA[jq]C[PeatMan: Is this wise?. White can attack 
from 2 sides. Maybe around Q10 is better?

J: Normally when you split a side like this, and when the white stones are so far away, you want to do so on the third line.
Afterwhich, the triangle areas are miai.];W[qf];B[qi]C[Peatman: Wide pincer seems best to me. I don't want him to build a big mojo between R14 and Q4.

J: looks good.];W[nd];B[pf];W[qc]C[Peatman: Now I should seal him in and grab the area behind the wall Q19..Q11.]
;B[pc]C[J: correct direction];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[qg]

(;B[pg]C[J: see variations, this move build a giant wall, it'll be hard to use.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc]C[Peatman: ... although 016 still worries me.]
;W[qh];B[ph];W[ri];B[fp]TR[om][on][oo][op]MA[rj][qj]C[PeatMan: strengthening my K4 stone and building a mojo seems more profitable to me.

J:  finishing the right side is ok (and safer) because it builds your wall more, and hurts white's Q4.

F4 is hard to make a moyo with only another stone here.  When F4 is used to make a moyo, there is usually a black wall around the triangles.

In this area, i would suggest F3 approach instead.];W[qj];B[np]
C[PeatMan: R11 does not seem that important to me, as O4 builds a nice mojo.

J: R11 is pretty big.  white's right side is getting stronger.]
;W[pn];B[oq]MA[nn][qq]C[PeatMan: I'm trying to seal off the bottom

J: This is making it too easy for white to have a big corner.  Because it is a corner, he's gaining more there than you are on the side.

X points instead are normal.];W[pq];B[or]C[J: Too small right now, white shouldn't respond.]
;W[pr];B[fc]MA[en][dg][dn][ch]C[J: this move doesn't make sense with your moyo strategy. X points are bigger.]
;W[dd]MA[cg]C[J: too easy for black, X is enough.];B[dc];W[bd]
C[Peatman: I wonder what his plan was with B16. Keeping it separated from D16 seems best.

J: tricky, horrible for white.];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[bf]C[Peatman: Pressing him low and running into him mojo seemed a good idea.]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[ci];W[bc];B[cc]C[Peatman: At this point I'm quite satisfied.]
;W[kd]C[PeatMan: Some invasion was to be expected.];B[ke]C[What to do to kill or to seal in?
Other options apart from L15:
- L17: get territory along the side and then -invade after his wall?
- N16 to keep him separated? He might aim at futher reduction to the left.

In hindsight I think L17 would be better.

J: Very hard to say here, nothing wrong with your response.]
;W[ld];B[jf]MA[jc]C[J: maybe K17 instead to wipe away white's base and solidify you territory.  Don't worry about k15 cut because you have so many stones around.]
;W[mf];B[lg];W[mg];B[ni];W[lh];B[mh]C[Peatman: I'm not sure if cutting is good option: he'll live by making eyes (inside my territory or by running.]
;W[jc];B[id];W[ic];B[hc];W[hb];B[gb];W[ia];B[hd]MA[lb]C[Peatman: He lives and my territory is kinda reduced.

J: don't worry about this cutting point. M18 instead to try to kill]
;W[mc];B[mb];W[lb];B[pi]MA[la]C[J: push in once more in sente.]
;W[rk];B[ok]C[J: slow right now.];W[ma];B[nb];W[le];B[kg];W[dm]
C[J: white doesn't grab territory or much influence with this..]
;B[ck];W[dk];B[cl];W[cj];B[bh]MA[bb]C[J: B18 instead to kill white.]
;W[bb];B[bj];W[cm];B[dl];W[el];B[eq];W[dq];B[fj]MA[ek]C[PeatMan: His area on the right is quite big I need mine around f13 badly. Let's seal it off by threatening a cut at E9

J: good, but you can think about cutting directly.  White will have a hard time connecting.  There is also the other cutting point to exploit later.]
;W[bm];B[bk]MA[al]C[J: A8 instead for shape.];W[fk];B[ei];W[hk]
;B[hi];W[gj];B[gi];W[hp]C[Peatman: He invades at H4 but I have the feeling he could invide my mojo much more severe at H3: He might threaten to connect to the left or to invade under K4, or If not blocked to run out to H5.

J: this is ok, G3 or G2 invasions are interesting, or even K3.]
;B[hq];W[er];B[fr];W[dr];B[gp];W[iq];B[ip];W[ho];B[ir];W[ep]
;B[fq];W[jj];B[li]C[PeatMan: J10, separating his two stones from the rest might be better idea?

J: this is fine, you don't want to get separated.];W[jh];B[ih]
;W[ji];B[kh];W[jl];B[pl];W[ql];B[gn];W[hn];B[en];W[em];B[dn]
;W[co];B[lo];W[mj]C[PeatMan: I'm connected anyway. Why?

J: noo idea.];B[lj];W[ml];B[ll]C[J: This area is dame, and is very difficult to make points in.]

;W[gm];B[fn];W[oa];B[im];W[hm];B[jm];W[ln];B[kn];W[io];B[cb]
C[PeatMan: This seemed quite big to me.

J: I agree.];W[ca];B[da];W[ba];B[ga]C[PeatMan: P8 would have been better. I was afraid of W: E19 / B D18 / W G19. But he should react to P8 first anyway.]
;W[na];B[oc];W[ol]C[PeatMan: Too bad.];B[cn];W[bn];B[oo];W[po]
;B[il];W[hj];B[ng];W[nf];B[lf]MA[of]C[J: P14 instead locally.

Nothing too horrible in the endgame.  Tough you made a couple of points in gote where bigger sente was still lying around.  

The take-away from this game should be not to strengthen the opponent's territory without due compensation. (you were lucky that the bottom ended up with as many points as it did.

This is my last comment; thankyou for showing me this game.]
