AB[pd][dp]C[Hello!
My name is Maxim, I was playing white in this game. Despite how it ended, I think that it acceptably illustrates the problem I have been having: it feels as if I have dropped several stones in strength, playing weaker than I know I can. After adding the comments to this game, I realized that part of the problem must be reading not often enough and not deep enough; still, that is only a part. I wrote down some of my reasoning I remembered; could you point out where I was wrong?
Thank you in advance.
(Maxim)

Hello, I am Laurent Lamôle, 1k KGS. I will comment your game and try to answer your questions.
My comments are followed by : (LL)
(Laurent)];W[pq];B[dd];W[cf];B[di]LB[cc:B][cn:A][qo:C]C[Didn't seem to threaten my C14 stone in any meaningful way, so I let it be. Did it?
(Maxim)

D11 is a pincer, not the most severe one, but a pincer nevertheless !
personnally, I would answer it by playing at B.
(LL)]
(;W[cn]TR[qf][qo]C[this move is not good. you can decide not to answer D11 if you want, but you should play on the largest area wich is the east side : for example at R5 or R14.
(LL)];B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[ck];B[dg]LB[cc:A][ee:B]
(;W[cc]C[I was in no way certain that I wanted this joseki, but no other move sprung to my mind. Keima towards the center from C14 to keep the black stones separated?.. But the keima would be cut itself. Now that I played out that variation I think that it could have brought me the corner with C16 and only then C17 — or could it? (see var.)
(Maxim)

this move is perfectly natural, and good.

(LL)];B[fc]LB[ec:B][ed:A]C[I admit that I was the first one to deviate from the proper sequence, but this move is definitely not something I expected (that being E17 or E16). The following plays demonstrated that my hane was an overplay, as I knew it would be even before I made it; but that hane was all I could think of to take advantage of that strange-looking keima.
(Maxim)

this move is perfectly playable.

[bh:C]C[Out of life and death problems I always have preferred the "death" ones rather than the "life" ones (that is, killing rather than surviving). After this move, could I have made an extra eye if I were to place a stone at, say, B12? Seems that it is so only because of my C9 and the weakness of the B15 group (see var. next turn)

with B and C as miai moves, white is alive.

(;W[qo]LB[hg:B][pn:A]C[This seemed more important than escaping from the ladder, and also seemed to affect it (of course, there was a ladder breaker already, but my reasoning was that it would strengthen that breaker  stone and allow me to ignore a black ladder breaker that would approach these stones. That led to pretty horrible results.)

it seems to be a possible choice, but a little dangerous.

black will normally reinforce his position while attacking this stone, so the "Triangle" group will become even more weak.
note that "Square" stones are also not definitively alive.
(LL)];B[lc];W[ne]C[No invasion this time, that was for sure. After all, my immediate goal was to prevent the opponent from enclosing a broad and high territory.
