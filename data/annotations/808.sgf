AB[pd][dp][dd]C[crazyd: White wins by 8.5.  I am Black, playing too fast, and following my opponent too much.

Jared: You played well. I did not feel that you were follwoing the opponent's stones to excess. You lost an overall won game as a result of a very few stupid mistakes. See commentary.]
;W[pf]C[Black B is a strong way to play. Black should be comfortable with a double white kakari against the hoshi stone. If not, there is never a better time to learn.]

(;B[nd];W[fp];B[dn];W[oo]C[White 5 is an interesting move. It is not unreasonable. However, Black can hardly fail to get a good result by entering at the 3-4, 3-3, or 4-3 points. White wants black to play at the 4-4 point.]
;B[pp];W[op]C[White is expecting Black to play at b, which would be followed by the double hane. However, Black a gives white a chance to play b first, which would have given white an even better result. But in this game, white fails to follow up on this opportunity.]

(;B[pq]C[White 9 at b is better.]
(;W[oq];B[po]C[crazyd: Should Q5 be at R6?
Jared: No. Building 4th line territory is good for black.];W[pn]
;B[qn];W[qm]C[The double hane no longer works as well for white. However, in a three stone handicap game, white desires complications, so 13 is understandable.]
;B[pm];W[on]C[Black a is perfect for white. Black b is correct.]

(;B[rm];W[ql];B[rl];W[pr]C[Black b is possible. See variation.]

(;B[ro];W[qk];B[qr];W[fn]C[White has a very good game. White's strategy of playing on the 5-5 point has worked out better than she could have expected. Black should probably take this opportunity to play at or near b. See variations. White's moyo is so ambitious that black should be able to live on the side.]

(;B[fq];W[gq];B[eq];W[gr];B[jm]C[Black 28 is a reasonable move. White's territory is not all that large. White 29 is very submissive. White b seems interesting in a handicap game.]

(;W[jo];B[lm]C[White 31 is small. Did the players switch sides after move 27?]
;W[or];B[ko];W[kp];B[lo];W[lp];B[jn]C[After 36, Black should have a won game.]
;W[cl]C[Black a is submissive. Black should play at b. See variation.]

(;B[cm]LB[em:b]C[crazyd: Does C7 work better at D8 or E7 or?
Jared: D8 as mentioned above. The play at b here is also possible.]
;W[co]C[Black should play at b. White is in great trouble.]

(;B[do];W[bm]C[Black should probably play b. See variations. Black a leaves an empty triangle.]

(;B[cn];W[bn];B[bo];W[cf]C[Black b is urgent and huge and sente.]

(;B[df];W[dg];B[ce];W[ef];B[de];W[cg];B[fd];W[el]C[White 53 should be at b. Since white misses this point, Black should play there immediately. See variation.]

(;B[jc];W[kk]C[Black 54 is fine. White 55 is useless. White cannot kill the black stones in the center.]
;B[io];W[jp]TR[io]C[Black 58 seems a little aimless. The marked stone is a forcing move, not worth thinking twice about. Black b feels better to me. Even so, White has a very lost game here, no matter how black plays.]

(;B[hm];W[ik];B[nm]C[White should now be thinking about killing black, since black has not advanced towards the center. This is White's last reasonable chance to win.]
;W[ml];B[mm];W[mo];B[mn];W[kl];B[km]C[White b or c destroys black's second eye and goes for the kill.]

(;W[nl];B[go];W[fo];B[ip];W[iq];B[gp]MA[gl]C[G6 better than G4?

Jared: I cannot imagine why Black would consider G6. G4 cuts white and threatens a play near X. See variations that follow White 73.]
;W[hq]C[Black 74 is a big move, and can be played before b.]

(;B[qf]C[White 75 should be at b. White is trying to make a complication in hopes of winning.]

(;W[qe]C[Black is clearly a reasonably strong player. Black 76 at b should be instinctive by now.]

(;B[qd]C[I think white 77 should be at b.]
(;W[re]C[Black b seems better. The corner is not too big. If white encroaches, black will secure the upper side.]

(;B[rd];W[qg];B[je]C[Black looks very nice here.];W[nf];B[rk]
;W[qj];B[ll];W[lk]C[Black 86 is very small.];B[om];W[kc]C[Black 88 at b seems very solid.]

(;B[kd]C[White 89 has to be at b.]
(;W[lc]C[Black 90 at b is decisive.]
(;B[nc];W[jb];B[ic];W[ib];B[hb];W[hc];B[gb];W[sd];B[sc];W[se]
;B[rb]C[crazyd: At this point I thought B was still ahead, although I felt that I had lost at least one handicap stone.

Jared: Black is way ahead, maybe even gained a handicap stone or two.]
;W[lf];B[ld];W[ol];B[pl];W[pk];B[rj];W[jg]C[White 107 is obviously a mistake.]

Black is suffering from occasional very sever slip ups with an otherwise very strong game. It is almost as if two different people are playing. White also makes some apalling slip ups. Again it seems as if white is also playing tag team with a weaker player.
Overall, this was a fun game to comment. Good luck to both players in future games.]
