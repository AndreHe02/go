C[deathgod [15k\]: Hi, gg

Hi, I've gone through the game and haven't seen any burning questions you wish to be answered, so I will just do general pointers for both Black (B) and White (W).

I have never seen the Great Wall strategy as you named it, I thought you had been refering to the Chinese Opening. But now that I have seen it, I don't think it is an effective strategy for you to be using. It's an influence superwall that has completely foregone the potential of creating a base.
Your opponent could have ignored your moves for another 5 turns and consolidated some real territory in the corners and sides.]

;W[oc]C[deathgod [15k\]: Please forgive me, but I am trying something out]
;B[jp];W[dq];B[kg]C[At this point, I have considered B's first 3 moves and given them a sceptical gaze. If you know what you're doing, they can be an interesting way to play. (I would expect some ruthless fighting skill.)
However, I would object to L13.
What does it achieve? It does not fix a large threat for B, nor does it threat W, nor does it make a lot of territory or influence.
It seems useless to me.];W[co];B[im];W[qp];B[op];W[oq];B[nq]
C[W generally has the idea here. "While B is doing that, I'm going to take these delicious corners."]

[oj][ck][dk][pp][gq]C[However, W could use the triangled stones to play bigger moves, ie: moves that are worth more points. See squared coordinates for examples of bigger moves.

Instead of securing what could be 4 points, W could make a potenial 30 points (which in the examples are a very likely 30 points as they are solid moves that can be connected easily. Living should not be an issue.)]

;B[hq];W[eq];B[dk];W[ck];B[cj];W[cl]C[From on, the game progresses without much happening.
W expands a little bit but wastes many moves securing small points. B does not make use of the stones in the centre to attack, and simply defends.]
