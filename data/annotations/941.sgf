C[Hi,

My thanks in advance for your willingness to review my game for me. This is
the second time I've done this. The first time was extremely helpful. I
appreciate it!

I played black (19k) versus a 16k opponent.

I lost by 85 points and I can't seem to really get what I did wrong. I
actually felt like I played a pretty good opening.

If I could learn how I could have won this game, I think it would really
help my game.

Sure thing, here goes...

19k IGS makes about 12k AGA, or thereabouts, I guess.  First of all, if you were 19k and your opponent 16k, you needed 3 stones handicap.  That is quite a difference.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pj]C[The moves through 5 are the opening I have been playing in most of
my games.

I have been trying to use the stone at Q10 as leverage toward both of my
corners.

As you'll see, I end up with no corners at all.  :-(

This is a pretty weak opening.  You would be better trying the Chinese opening - B plays Q16, Q3, then either R9 or Q9 (I prefer the low opening at R9).  There is a good book on it available from Kiseido...

This is weak because W can play Q5 then Q8, giving himself a strong position.]
;W[po];B[mp]C[This is a bit weak.  It would hove been better at either Q7, taking advantage of your stone above, or P4.  To P4, W would reply P5, and B can play at N3 for excellent shape.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]C[The move here that is joseki is generally P2.  It is low, but W cannot push much.]
;B[pp];W[oo];B[qm]C[Hmm....  you needed to play at the bottom.  Your stones are still weak.]
;W[qn]C[Through 14, I thought it looked really good for me. His shape seemed
small and weak, and I had good presence on both the sides.

D10 seems like a good move since there is Miai in either direction.

Was there a blunder here of some kind?

Yes.  He is very strong - he has eye space on the side, and is sticking out into the center, whereas you have a weak group on the bottom, and your R7 stone is all alone.]
;B[dj];W[pm];B[ql];W[pl]C[W takes center influence...];B[pk]
;W[jq]C[...then attacks at the bottom.];B[kq];W[kp];B[kr];W[ip]
;B[lp];W[ko];B[mn]C[With 27, I wanted to keep a path into the middle and also keep some
pressure on the lower right white stones

You did ok on the bottom.  W was a bit passive, but it works in his favor.]
;W[pe];B[mc]C[Looking at this now, I think 29 at R16 would be better.

I think I had in mind a 4-4 star point opening rather than the 3-4 point.

Is R16 best here, or should I have followed up differently, or should I
maybe have played S16?

R16, or P16, or O16...];W[qc];B[pd];W[qd];B[oe];W[pf];B[qg]
C[Worry about settling your stones before attacking.  This was unnecessary.]
;W[pb];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]C[Here, again, my feeling was that I had more or less confined White
to relatively small life, which I could squeeze from two sides.

And, I had good positions on both sides. (I thought.)

What was I missing?

Look who is overconcentrated - it is your black stones on top.  They are not very strong, and W has about 12 points in the corner.]
;W[jd];B[fd]C[I think I would have played C14 here.  Take advantage of the D10 stone.  I know you want to keep him from getting too much on top...]
;W[cg]C[W plays lightly, attacking your stone.];B[cn];W[co]
;B[dn];W[fp]C[W has 30 points in that corner.];B[cq]C[This corner invasion didn't succeed, and from what I know, it should
have.

What are some good tips for winning these 3-3 point invasions?

I thought the added influence of my stone at C6 would guarantee life for me.

Help?!];W[bo];B[cp];W[do];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr]C[You could have played at B4 instead.  If W takes the E2 stone, you play at C2 and make life after the capture at A2.]
;B[es];W[fs];B[cr];W[ar]C[I see no way to get out of this at this point...  It is because the B5 stone is lower than C4.  This was your mistake - as i said before, you needed to close off the side.]

;B[cm];W[en];B[em];W[fn];B[ic];W[id];B[hd];W[jc];B[ib];W[if]
;B[ef]C[Excellent move, good timing.];W[dh]C[A 3-3 invasion might have worked here.]
;B[de];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[bd];B[cf];W[eb];B[ec];W[dc]
;B[fb];W[ed];B[ee];W[fc];B[gc];W[fe];B[ec];W[cb];B[fc]C[Letting him force you into connecting this ko in gote cost you big, keeping you from cutting off the W stones on the left side.  Thot was a huge loss.]
;W[fh];B[dg];W[eg]C[Here's where I start to get baffled. All of these nice large groups
that I have all manage to be dramatically reduced and attacked.

None of my groups look to me to be as weak as they actually were.

I'd appreciate any light you can shed on the next 50 to 60 or so moves. It
just seemed like White had a rhythm going that I was powerless to stop.

Your two groups on the top left are separated, and very weak.  The other group on the left side is flailing, and the right side is far from solid.  The top right looks ripe for a move at O16...]
;B[bg];W[ch]C[You needed to play at F14, to get out from the side.]

;B[dk];W[bj];B[bi];W[gl];B[fm];W[gm];B[fk];W[gj];B[gk];W[hk]
;B[fj];W[gi];B[ai];W[he]C[A move around N14 would be good here.  You get territory in the center, especially because that is where he is aiming.]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[hb];W[of];B[lb]C[Small.];W[ne];B[kc]C[Small.]
;W[kd];B[lc];W[nd];B[nc];W[rr];B[qs]C[You should have played around P4...]
;W[ml];B[mj]C[Too far.  O 10 is better.];W[oq];B[or];W[pr];B[nq]
;W[np];B[ps];W[op];B[nr]C[Good decision giving up those stones.]

Perhaps.  He could have killed you...];B[ms];W[rk];B[rj];W[qk]
;B[qj];W[rl];B[ni]C[S13 would be better to settle your stones.]

;W[lg];B[dg];W[qh];B[rh];W[df];B[ji];W[kj];B[dg];B[df];C[End of the game. I have no significant territory and a mass of dead
stones in the corner.

(Had I won that corner invasion, I still would have lost by about 60 point,
by my count.)

What in the world went so wrong?

He basically nickel and dimed you to death.  Look back at the opening, and try and see where you overextended, or overconcentrated your stones.  Then look at where he whittled away at your small groups, while securing his.    Study the fundamentals - get a book on tesuji, and avoid a lot of the little moves that cost, say, 5 points each, but all add up in the end.    Keep trying, and don't get too discouraged.

Hope this helps some...
