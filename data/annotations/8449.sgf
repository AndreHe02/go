This is a Game between me and my "Rival".
Our Record is about even, maybe a little to my favor but it is always a small win.

I playing black!

I'd recommand comments for both players but i can only submit my thoughts.


REVIEWER:  PETE 3k AGA. 

PETE: Hi! I'm happy to review this game for you. It was an excellent game with many interesting moves by both players (including double-atari and connect-and-die).

As a general comment for both players: 
1. Try to look for sente moves - avoid gote moves unless you think your group is in danger
2. Try to not follow your opponent. Don't LOOK where your opponent just played. Try to always look at the whole board as if you just saw the board position for the first time and your job was to find best move for your given color (typical 'find best move' problem). 
3. The white / black group on the side (around C10 and C14) stayed undisturbed for too long. That area had urgent double-sente - http://senseis.xmp.net/?SenteSente). Important to play those moves as soon as they show up.

Please consider providing rating for this review on GTL.];B[pd]

I often attack those low corner stones because i dont want my enemy to get settled so easy in the corner.


PETE: Sure, definitely playable strategy. Another strategy could be to play at A and see what white does. If white wants to play territory game at the bottom, then interfering with that plan with move at B is definitely good idea. If white decided to go with an influence-oriented game then move at C would be probably better for black. By playing at B right away, you are giving white the opportunity to play for influence without interference. This might be OK plan considering the two marked black stones will interfere with white's influence to some extend. Either way, move at B is a fine choice.]
;W[pq]LB[dp:A]C[PETE: white would be better off pincering black stone here. I would probably chose low & close pincer because white has the stone at A (white can afford to be more confrontational and have more severe fight that drags on).]
;B[op];W[qm];B[kq]C[__________________________________________


I was suprised not to get pincered but so i could build a base

PETE: yes, this is a good result for black.];W[cf];B[df]LB[jd:A]
C[PETE: this is ideal if black already had a stone at A. Otherwise black will have to play there in gote in order to make that ideal formation.]
(;W[ce]LB[dg:A]C[__________________________________________


I have to admit that i dont have a clue how to vary the attack and extend Joseki

PETE: I don't actually think that's a joseki. Typically white responds at A. Since white didn't do it, black should find some way of punishing white. Playing black at A now is one option.]
(;B[de]C[PETE: too timid response];W[dg];B[cd]LB[de:A][ef:B]
C[PETE: you can see why this is not a joseki. Stone at A should be at B for better shape efficiency.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[ad]LB[jd:A]C[__________________________________________

I hate those early Endgame Moves! they show up very often between my ranks lately.


PETE: yeah, this is bad for white but unfortunately white got himself in this trouble. Black can collect the benefits and get the move at A with a nice wall facing it.]
(;B[ac]C[PETE: too small. Don't follow your opponent. Look for bigger force-moves. White MIGHT at this point realize: oh man, this is just 4 points, screw it, I'm going to play a big move some place else. And black would be left behind in gote. See variation.]
;W[bf];B[cn]LB[jd:C][eg:A][fg:B]C[PETE: I would push white forward one stone by playing at A first. See variation.]
;W[cl]C[PETE: yes, the right pincer. This should force black to jump in the corner.]
(;B[cj]LB[cj:A][cn:B]C[PETE: slightly too aggresive for black, I think. Which stone are you hoping to save A or B? If it is A, then move at B was a waste and perhaps you should save it for later. Why not just play A to begin with? You would have more room right?]
;W[el]C[PETE: yes, black will either need to try to save both of this groups by jumping out or try to connect them under white.]
(;B[ej]
(;W[en]LB[bl:B][dm:A]C[PETE: I think move at A captures the black stone without the possiblity of it connecting with the two stones above. 
If black gains any more strength with his stone, he can try to peep at A and cut white.]
;B[cp]LB[cq:A]TR[cj][ej]C[PETE: black stones don't have much room to live. This strategy of trying to save them can only work if black uses the two marked stones effectively. Without those two stones there, the best response is to jump into the corner at A instead.]
;W[cq];B[bl];W[bm]
(;B[bk]C[PETE: mistake - white separates black easily from here on...]

(;W[do]C[PETE: mistake];B[cr];W[dq];B[dr]

Better to block black at A.]
(;B[ap]LB[jd:A][qf:B]C[__________________________________________


He said he did never play such an weired opening ever.


PETE: :) yes, a bit strange. There are big opening moves like A and B left but game has moved to small group fight early on.]
;W[co]
(;B[ar]C[__________________________________________

maybe i could have done better in connecting to the middle group. but so i was able to live in the corner and maybe i can attack the top white group later. at least i can extend to the middle i thought.

PETE: yes - end result is still not as good as connecting with middle group but at least nothing died yet.]
;W[bp];B[er];W[qf]LB[eg:B][fg:A]C[PETE: for safety reasons I think it is more important to jump at A now. If white wants to play safe, maybe play at B.]
;B[qh]LB[nc:C][nd:B][qm:A]C[PETE: considering black is in an unfriendly territory (the stone at A is fairly strong), I would recommend playing at B or C instead. It will deter white from coming to the top area.]
;W[qj];B[oh];W[nc]LB[nc:B][qf:A]C[__________________________________________


I wasn't sure how to react here but i wanted to cut the white stones

PETE: white could have gotten better result by coming in at B directly, without playing A which black's marked stones are now about to caputure. So if your plan was to reduce / invade the top, it would be better to just play B from the start.]
;B[nd]
(;W[pc]LB[md:A]C[PETE: typical josekis start with white responding at A.]
(;B[qd]LB[mc:B][md:A]C[PETE: since white didn't take the outside and he seems to want the corner, and since the wall on the left is condusive to making some profit for black, I would suggest that black plays B and lets white take the corner in gote.]
;W[qc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mc];B[rc]LB[jc:B][eg:A]C[PETE: not necessary - white cannot connect under. Black would be better of playing A now and then follow-up with B.]

(;B[re]LB[eg:A]C[PETE: no necessary Move at A is so big. It is top priority right now.]
;W[jc];B[hc]LB[eg:A]C[__________________________________________


just saving some territory

PETE: This move is gote because white is already safe on the top. Better to attack with A first. Play sente moves first!]
;W[ke]TR[ad][bd][ce][bf][cf][dg]C[PETE: this move doesn't earn white more than 3 points and doesn't reduce black's territory or potential either. It is also a gote move. White should play somewhere around the marked stones to 1) save them and 2) attack black.]

[ni][oi]C[__________________________________________


i did not count but i hadn't the feeling this was too deep


PETE: Yeah, probably too deep to just save that one stone. You can sacrafice the stone and get stronger walls around the marked areas but the question is: whould they help you? The anwer is 'no'. there are no weak groups in that area. Black cannot hope to gain much territory from such walls and if they cannot be used for fiting white groups, they are useless. 
Black should instead consider territory moves like A or attack moves like B.]

[is][js]C[PETE: count he points: capturing these marked stones is exactly 6 points. Playing moves like A secures at least 10. Play at B is also possible. White might try to reduce the area with moves like C-E but that's OK.

(;B[eg]C[__________________________________________

often i notice me playing moves thinking "if he doesn't react i have some good chances of attacking."
never thinking so far that the last move would be very pittyfull if he would react
i think this is such move

PETE: there is a better way to attack. And yes, I agree with you -- you always have to keep your opponent's response in mind and NEVER assume the opponent wont respond to a threat like this. If white doesn't respond, he is obviously in a ton of trouble. So assume your opponent sees stuff like that.]

i like running away more than fithing to live.
bad - a big white wall was born.
but i hate fighting and i did not count if i can live on the left side.


PETE: running away is often worse than living locally. Unless you are destroying your opponents's territory while running and you can always live easily, it is better to live locally. 
Best way to make points is to chase your opponent because he is unable to make two eyes locally. In this position running is the only choice because black cannot make two eyes with A.]

;W[mk]LB[bh:B][sm:A][mp:C]TR[ml][mm]C[PETE: sometimes it is hard to give up ANY stones but single-kyu players always consider stuff like this: marked stones are worth about 5 points in gote.
