C[My name is Kim (aka phantom), and I'll be reviewing this game for white, Marcin Balaban.  If you have any questions after reading the review, you can email me (gophantom@gmail.com).

Marcin's main question was how to deal with it when his opponent makes "a big structure," so I'll try to address that as well as some of the other issues I noticed in the game.]

TR[dd][ck][dq]C[Up to this point, the game has been completely reasonable.  There's nothing to criticize.

Black's first three moves (the triangled stones) make what is called the Chinese Opening.  It  is a very common opening, and it can be frustrating to play against it.  If you are running into it a lot and having trouble playing against it, I suggest looking it up.  A lot has been writen both about how to play with it and how to play against it.]
;B[jp];W[do]C[This is a good time to invade, and a pretty good place in which to do it.]

(;W[eq]LB[ck:C][cm:B][eq:A]C[Up until this point you followed a perfectly reasonable joseki.  But, his move is strange.  What do you hope to get with it?

Sure, there are things you can do if black ignores it or makes some sort of mistake.  But, if black plays well, he will be fine, and white will not really gain anything.  As we will see over the course of the next couple of moves, all it does is to help black solidify the bottom territory, and it does not help white's eye space at all.

The usual place to play in a situation like this is at B.  (See variation.)

On a different board, it would be nice to play a point or two farther, like at C.  But, since black already has a stone there, that is obviously not an option.]
;B[er];W[ep];B[fq]C[See how nice this is looking for black?

The bottom of the board is looking like nice solid territory for black.  Meanwhile, white has gained nothing.]

;W[em];B[ho]
(;W[fl]LB[fl:A][hm:B]C[This move is very slow.  You're not really threatening anything big, so black can ignore it if he really wants.  But, responding is nice for black too.  He is very happy to solidify his top left territory a little more with a move at F9.

You really just want to make sure you don't get trapped in.  So, something like a jump to H7 would be fine.  (See variation.)]
;B[fk];W[gp]LB[hm:B][gp:A]C[fThis seems like wishful thinking.  It reminds me of the earlier move at E3.  If black igores it, it's nice.  If black just defends as he does in the game.  It's good for black.  Unfortunately, if black punishes by cutting at G5 (A), it could get pretty nasty.

If you want to help this group, just jump out.  Something like B is still perfectly reasonable.]
(;B[gq]LB[go:B][gq:A]C[While it's fine for black to play at A, it would be much better if he would cut at G5.  (See variation.)]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[go];B[ip];W[hn];B[io];W[in]C[This is another slow move.  Again, I would suggest just jumping.  At this point, tenuki is also an option.]
;B[oc]C[Black is smart to tenuki at this point.  There is not much more he can get out of trying to continue to push white around in the bottom left.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[pf];B[lc];W[db];B[cc];W[qj];B[ge];W[on]LB[jd:C]
[ie:B][on:A]C[This move is a little too small and a little too vague.  While it is nice for strengthening what white has on the right side of the board, there are far bigger/more important moves to consider right now.

The area around B and C is pretty big.   White's group up there and black's group just to the right of it are the two smallest and weakest groups on the board.  Neither should be in danger of dying, but both players should want to strengthen theirs while weakening their opponent.  Both players should also  want to get those groups out into the middle of the board because if either closes the other in, the resulting influence in the middle of the board would be nice.]
;B[jb];W[ib];B[jc];W[pb]LB[pb:A][id:B][ie:C]C[This move is not at all urgent right now.

It looks like it was played to weaken black's group and perhaps threaten to kill it.  But, black's group isn't weak enough of to kill or seriously threaten.  He can still get out and he can still connect to his other group.  So, he has nothing to worry about.

White on the other hand, does have some worries.  While white is in no danger of dying yet, the group in the upper left is weak and in danger of being trapped.  Getting to the center is really important right now.  B and C are both good options.]
;B[ob];W[nq]C[This gets points while threatening to take points away from black, so it's nice.  But, it's still not as big as getting that group on the top right out into the center.]
;B[mq];W[np]C[The top right is still more important.];B[cb]
;W[ec]LB[fb:B][ec:A]C[It is slightly better to defend at B here.  While it won't make this group completely safe, it gives better shape and makes it easier to take care of.]
;B[gb]
(;W[fb]LB[fb:A][gc:B]C[This is not the right way to handle G18 at all.  It lets black cut, and once white is cut, there's no way to make two eyes for the right half of the group.  Consider B instead.  (See variation.)]
;B[gc]C[This move is the final nail in the coffin.  White is split, and there's no way to save the stones now.  After losing the stones, white is just too far behind to win the game.  So, I'll end the review here.

I don't think you handled black's big area too poorly.  You invaded at a good time and in a good place.  The problem was the way you handled the invasion stones after the initial invasion.  In the future, when you invade, don't think so much about pushing your way out.  That just makes your opponent stronger and makes it harder for you to invade elsewhere later.  Instead, play light moves and get yourself out into the center.  Once you're out, you're harder to kill.  Also, try not to give up sente by playing moves that you don't need once you have a living group.

The other problem in this game was the failure to protect the group in the top left.  In the future, try to play closer attention you weak groups.  Try to keep an eye out for unexpected moves like G17 that you might not normally consider as playable.  They can surprise you and make a group that seemed alive suddenly unstable.  Also, when you get in trouble, remember that you can often save your stones if you can just get to the center.]

(;W[gc];B[hb]C[Black can still play like this to connect, save his stone, and make it hard for white to make eyes.]
;W[hc]C[White just needs to stay connected.];B[ia]C[Black needs to stay connected too.]
;W[fb]C[Now white has some forcing moves, starting with this one.]
;B[ja];W[fa]C[White gets to make an eye by threatening a snapback.]
;B[ha];W[ie]C[Now white can jump to the center.  From this point, white would still have a tough game, but his stones would be alive and he would have a fighting chance.]

C[At this point, white is very dead.]))
(;W[hm]TR[gn]C[With a move like this, you make your way into the center of the board, and you can stop worrying about getting closed in..

Note that black will not want to play at G6.  If you continue on this path, you will see why.]

(;W[cm]C[This move gives white the beginings of a base and some eye shape.  It is a good shape for living and getting out.]
