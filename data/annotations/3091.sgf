C[Hi, Thanks for reviewing my game, I play as black in this game. I have been playing for a few months now and have been improving steadily...recently I've reached around 18k on IGS and seem to be having more difficulties facing stronger opponents.  I decided it would be a good time to send in another game to review to find out what my main weaknesses are that have failed me in recent games.
I would also like to improve in yose, please point out big points I should play first when appropiate.

/Y
Hi, the reviewer is Yannick, currently 7k on KGS. I will mark my comments with /Y.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[Chinese Fuseki - I enjoy moyo orientated games.

/Y
This is indeed a moyo oriented game, since the next move by W creates a san-ren-sei (three aligned star points), another powerful shape to build influence.]
;W[dj];B[jp];W[nc];B[pf]LB[ne:A]C[/Y
An alternative to Q14 would be at A, in order to create a moyo a bit less flat.]
;W[kd];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[jj]LB[fc:D][me:A][cf:C][fo:B]
C[Is this a good applicating of "taking the last big point"?

/Y
I don't think this is really a big point. When two moyos are side by side, the big points are at the borders. In that case it would be around points A or B.

Of course there is still the possibility of invading W sphere of influence, around C or D for instance.]

C[Sealing in.];W[fc]
(;B[cc]LB[be:B][cf:A]C[Afterwards I felt this invasion was premature, perhaps around A (C14) would be a better point to take?

/Y
You are right, W welcome the invasion at the san-san because it will allow him to build a perfect shape in relation with the D10 extension. In this position the recommended invasion is at B (see variations in the previous move).]

;W[bc];B[ab];W[cb];B[db];W[qc]C[I felt I achieved poor results invading at the 3-3 point.]
;B[qd]C[Blocking on the wider side.
Included variation if I blocked on the other side...which is better?

/Y
I don't have the variation in the file.

B played in the right direction as far as I can say.];W[pc]
;B[oc]C[I was unhappy that my corner was taken away so I was more aggressive here.

/Y
There is no reason to be unhappy, this is a consequence of playing the star point. Your corner is taken away but you get to build a thick wall that will be useful in the later stages of the game. 

playing P17 is a possible way to play];W[od];B[ob]
(;W[pb]C[/Y
This is obviously a mistake. See variation.];B[nb];W[mc];B[mb]
C[/Y
W has two nearby weak groups. This is a terrible situation. The proper way to handle this is to discard the group in the corner.]
;W[rd];B[lc];W[md];B[re];W[rc];B[oe];W[nd];B[qe]LB[qf:A]C[Was this neccessary?

/Y
It's OK, having a stronger group allows B to make a more severe attack on the N16 W group. Better played at A though (better shape)]
;W[ra];B[ld];W[me];B[le];W[mf];B[ic];W[lf];B[ke];W[kf];B[je]
C[In general I was happy with this result, I wasn't actually expecting to take teritory on the upper edge.

/Y 
Yes good result for B. W is left with a very heavy, eyeless group.]
;W[jh]
(;B[mj]LB[oh:A][hn:B]C[I'm not sure about this move...I was thinking of securing my moyo yet looking at it now, I don't think this move achieved that too well because of a move by white around A and the lower side is still open around B.

/Y
You are right, this is the wrong direction of play. What about attacking the heavy W group in order to turn the moyo at the bottom into territory ? See variation.]

/Y
I think this move was not necessary since W cannot do much (cf. variation).
A good point to play would be at A.];W[pp];B[oq];W[hf];B[ie]
C[incorrect move, should have been at H15

/Y
OK];W[he]C[D'oh!];B[hd];W[gd];B[gc];W[fd];B[gb];W[fa];B[ga]

Useless move.];B[ba]C[/Y
Useless move as well];W[ql]LB[rk:B][cr:A]C[/Y
From this point on, W takes all the big yose points. B answers too passively. For instance in that case, B could play A instead of B.]

;B[ca];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[/Y
In conclusion, I think the key of this game was the weak N16 W group. Black could have attacked it more, not in order to kill it, but in order to extend B moyo at the bottom, or in order to reduce more W moyo.]
