[mi][ni][mj][nj]C[I think that your move at M11 wasnt really that bad, it was near these stones(triangles) so its not like you are shooting blind, there may be better moves; you could try deeper maybe around here(squares) to be really bold, and maybe even reckless you could try there (at A) although i dont highly reccomend it ^_^]
;W[li]C[I used this move with the intention of reducing black's moyo, I would like to know if there are better variations, would a play at around L 10 be better ?]
;B[lk]TB[fa][ga][ha]C[Here you wanted to know if the knights move is better, you can try it, its not bad, the problem with your move is it was a little slow]
