;B[pq];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[qo];W[mq]C[I do not like this move]

(;B[ql]C[when a 4-4 stone is played in a corner it is capible of extending on both sides. For instance D16 wants to extend to K16(17) or D10(C10). so I would say this extenstion at R8 although it is short it does not take the extention the 4-4 stone wants.]

(;B[od];W[pc]C[this exchange is not good for black, it removes much of the aji in invading the corner at R17, which can be done later, instead black gives white tons of corner territory and is happy.]
;B[pe];W[qe];B[pf];W[qf];B[pg];W[ph];B[ng]C[ddyer [?\]: not a good start for black]
;W[jd];B[nb]C[This move is small, sure by playing P18 your not allowing the monkey jump, but there are many bigger moves on the board.]
