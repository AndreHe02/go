C[JJ: Hi, I'm JJHaggar, the reviewer. In this game white played a Moyo-oriented style and black played the more conventional territory-oriented style. Except a pair of minor errors you played very well, I'll comment variations for the plays I think can be improved. I think the game was decided on the timing for reducing the moyo. Hope you enjoy the review.]
