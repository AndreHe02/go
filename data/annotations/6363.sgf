C[Dear reviewer,

thx for reviewing my game.

I played white in this game

Comments from Az];B[pd]C[Buster [1d\]: hi gg``

C[Az: I don't know if it's a question of right and wrong, but I think I would prefere to play 'a', this feels a little slow.]
;B[cj];W[ch]LB[cf:A]C[Az: This type of wide extension doesn't really do much for your corner. If your opponents invades at the 3-3 point then one or the other stone won't be very useful. I think 'a' is the right move, since although it puts less pressure on him it develops your position a lot more.]
;B[cm];W[co];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg]
;B[db];W[eb];B[cb]TR[jc][eb]C[Az: The result is really bad for white. K17 is much too close, and there are bad shape problems you don't have enough time to fix.]
;W[dl]LB[em:A]C[Az: Instead of the contact move, maybe cap at 'a'. Black is very thin, and you want to attack more than just lean on his group for thickness.]
;B[cl];W[dj];B[dk];W[ek];B[ck];W[di];B[em];W[el];B[dm]LB[fm:A]
C[Az: White 'a' for sure.];W[gl];B[gm];W[hm];B[gn];W[hn];B[ep]
;W[eo];B[gp];W[hp];B[ho];W[io];B[go];W[fm];B[fn];W[fl];B[hq]
;W[en];B[bn];W[bo];B[bi];W[ip];B[fq];W[gr]LB[ec:A][ag:B]C[is there a way to kill black A group ?

Az: No. *If* you fix the cut at 'a' then descending to 'b' is sente against the life of the top group, but even with 'b' the best I can see is seki. (You're fairly strong so I assume you know how to kill the top if black ignores 'a' and 'b', but if not send the sgf back and I'll add a variation, it's something everyone should know)]
;B[je]LB[cl:A]C[is there a way to kill black A group ?];W[ke]
;B[kf];W[kd];B[if]LB[jh:A][lf:B]C[Az: This is heavy! The proper move for black is 'a'. W should answer at 'b' immediately to attack these stones. B can't really give them up, and this way you get milage out of all your thickness.]
;W[op];B[mq];W[no]LB[or:A][lf:B]C[Az: The last couple moves for white don't make sense, and here is why: if white thinks that his stone at P4 and any followup moves will be weak, then there are many better places on the board to play than P4. If white thinks that his thickness nearby makes these stones strong, then he should split black with 'a'. There is no reason to create a weak group when there are so many other big places on the board.

I think 'a' was more urgent, since it is hard to avoid falling back on the defensive this way.]
;B[lo];W[mn];B[km];W[ll]C[Az: You should only play keima if you're alright with the possibility that they might push and cut]
;B[lm]
(;W[nl]TR[lm][ll]LB[qq:A]C[a bad move i guess

Az: Yes. The exchange of the two stones is really bad for you, but it can't be undone. White should attach in the corner to try to settle the group, then aim at N7 later to start a fight (once you're secure).]
;B[mm];W[nm];B[on]LB[pn:A]C[Az: How about a more interesting response like 'a'? Your group is very heavy, and there's no way to realistically attack black until if and when your group is alive, so it's time to stop thinking about saving every stone. White must find another answer to connecting.]
;W[nn];B[ml];W[jg]LB[qq:A]C[Az: Big, but not urgent. You must help your group first, it is too big and too weak to leave it. 'a' would be one idea, since it gives you at least one eye and you can threaten followup on the right side.]
;B[jf]LB[kg:A]C[Az: Heavy, black should extend.];W[nj]LB[pq:A]
C[Az: Getting out is big, but if black plays 'a' then you have no eye space and you're in blacks moyo. Therefore you must attach in the corner at R3 first.]
;B[mk];W[nk];B[qm];W[li]C[Az: Overplay. Black can just push and cut, his group is strong enough. Then white is really in trouble and black will take a lot of profit in the right.]
;B[kj]C[Az: Weak answer from him];W[ki];B[jj];W[mf];B[ic]LB[ec:A]
C[Az: This is not very urent, black should link up his groups, since J17 and 'a' will be miai. If anything, 'a' is worth more when he does turn here]
;W[jd]LB[oi:A][pi:B]C[Az: A good move locally, but white needs to think about his own group before starting off on adventures. It burns some aji, but one idea would be to try to force 'a'-'b' in sente, if you've decided you want to attack.

White has weaknesses around that area *and* in the upper left from the joseki disaster in the beginning, so a really fierce attack is not reasonable.]
;B[id];W[he];B[ie];W[gc]LB[fc:A]C[Az: Gotta be 'a', the whole shape around here is getting thin.]
;B[jh]C[here, my position began to collapse

Az: No, here it became evident that things were thin for a long time. Many of the problems came before.]
;W[ig];B[kg]LB[nh:A]C[Az: There are too many cutting points going on here, just link up your stones. Thre will be chances to cut black later.]
;W[kh];B[mg];W[pi]C[Az: Now it is too late to get black to answer here, helping you protect the cut.]
;B[nf]C[Az: After this it's hard to imagine a happy ending, white is severely on the defensive.]
;W[kb]LB[ib:A]C[Az: Hane at 'a'. Your group is in much more trouble than his, so avoiding helping him a little bit isn't so important.]
;B[ib]C[Az: Black got the vital point.];W[nc];B[ob];W[nb];B[oc]
;W[me];B[hg];W[ih];B[ji];W[hh];B[mi]C[Az: Game over, black can't loose from this position without doing something unforgiveably bad.]

Az: Yes, your group isn't exactly alive....];B[pg];W[ln];B[kn]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[nq];B[mr];W[pq];B[or];W[oq];B[mp];W[qr]
(;B[nr]C[Az: White got incredibly lucky, black can kill the entire group right now.]
;W[rr];B[rq];W[sq];B[rp];W[pr];B[sr];W[ss];B[gh]LB[hf:A]C[Az: B should just play 'a', he'll win the game by at least 15 points.]
;W[hf];B[gg];W[hi];B[gd]
(;W[gi];B[ge]C[Az: Resisting the other way would have been better for white. There are still some nasty things black can do and I'd expect he'd win that way too. This was definetly the last chance though, it's hopeless after this.

(;W[mm];B[ml];W[lk];B[nl];W[jl]C[Az: The fighting looks difficult for both sides, since black doesn't want to help the middle group by hurting the corner. I think black is better off, but either try to sacrafice / trade your group or stand and fight.]
