Comments marked "al>"

al> As requested, I have tried to indicate why black mananged to get such large chunks of territory.]

;B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[qn];B[ql];W[rp]C[This may have been a mistake

al> I believe that you usually start by jumping out to P6, to avoid getting stuck by the border. When the opponent answers with a pinch like this (B R8) you will have to go for destroying their potential territory instead of creating your own - that is why you want to make sure you can cross the line between Q4 and R8 here. Turns out it solved itself in this game.]
;B[qq];W[rm];B[rl];W[on]C[wasn't really sure what to do here

al> A drwback of playing S4 and S7 before jumping out is that now black has reinforced the corner/bottom as well as getting a start of a wall at line 8 while white gets very little territory out of this exchange.

al> At the beginning of the game it is often better to keep it more open and not settle situations too soon.]
;B[mp];W[mn]C[al> W N6 is not necessary right now and does not accomplish much. Attacking the black stones at line 8, by playing R11 stops black from building territory along the side and also commences an attack on the top corner.]
;B[ef]C[al> Odd move by black. At the start it is generally better to keep to the borders, like at max the third line, as it is easier to build territory there.]
;W[cf];B[qh];W[nc]C[al> W O17 comes from the wrong direction, I think. Black has the opportunity to create territory along the right side, and white is actually forcing that with this move.

al> It would still be interesting to try to separate blacks stones by playing R10 (as R12 should have been at R11 - this is too wide). Black had been forces to decide what was most important, the upper or lower right side, instead of automatically getting both.]
;B[oc]C[al> But black does not take the cue :)];W[nb]C[al> This is one reason black managed to "lock the board". B O16 comes eventually, pushing white down (up) against the edge of the board and staring to make points towards the center.

al> Think of it this way: the stones are fence posts. At first, you deply them loosely, with big gaps in between, like sketching the possible outline of the territory the fence will surround when it is done. Then you out new fence posts between the existing ones until both players have negotioated their respective territory.

al> If you look at how sucessful black vs white has been so far in placing fence posts, it is obvious that black has done the better job at this point. BLack has outlined (but not settled yet) about thirty points at the bottom, and another tewnty something at the upper right side. White has outlined less than ten (lower left side, as the top left corner is still wide open).]
;B[ob];W[jc]C[al> Again, this is too wide; L17 avoids tempting black to play M17 next.]
;B[fd]C[al> THis is another odd move by black, prompting white to reinforce the top left corner.]
;W[ec]C[al> ...like so. That is a big point, almost securing about 15 pts in the corner.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[ke]C[al> THe exchange starting with B O16 has made white about ten points along the top, while black has created an area extending towards the center, at the same time as the top right has gotten increasingly harder for white to invade. Black may gain like 30 points with this.]
;B[nl]C[al> Another bold fence post, although the gap is a little too wide and could possibly provide an attack vector for white.]
;W[qc]C[al> White has little chance of surviving here at this time. The most likely outcome would be that black strengthen their moyo.

al> White would have a better chance of reducing blacks potential territory by striking from the outside, around P13 and subsequently jumping out towards the center, possibly making a dent in black's moyo.]
;B[qd];W[pb];B[oa];W[pc]C[al> W Q17 creates the infamous "empty triangle" which is considered bad shape. B S18  or S17 will make it impossible for white to live here.]
;B[oe];W[rd];B[rb];W[rc];B[re];W[sb]
(;B[mc]C[al> BLack just lost the corner, or should have lost it, as the corner is worth about 20 pts for black, while the (unconditional) capture of the two white stones will give at most around 10 pts in prisoners and reduction of white's territory.
Hope that the variations work.]
(;W[mb]C[al> White just lost the corner.];B[lc]C[al> Black just lost the corner :)]
;W[kd];B[lb];W[gc]C[al> The white L16 group is not in imminent danger (as it still can run out in the center), and this move does not compensate for the loss of the upper right corner, so the priority for white should be clear.]
;B[cg];W[bg]C[al> Creeping under the black stone along the second line creates very little territory and gives black a chance to connect their stones. Trying to split the black groups by playing D14-E13 feels better to me (if ignoring the top right corner, of course)]
;B[ch];W[ck];B[dj];W[cj];B[ci];W[bi]C[another blunder.  But I feel as though at this point, B has the board locked up, and I am not sure how they did it.

al> The center of the board is still reasonably open to white. PLaying L13 instead of B11, for instance, is one way of avoiding black taking full control of the center.

al> But black would still get a huge territory in the upper right quadrant. That is why it is a good idea to mix outlining territory along the edges of the board, with darting out towards the center here and there in order to prevent the opponent from getting territory there. It is much easier to destroy potential in the center of the board than to get many points in territory there.]
;B[bh]C[al> Black L14 would be way bigger, in points (still disregarding the upper right corner)]
;W[bf];B[bj];W[cl]C[al> White B9 would force black to capture at the same time as white protects the lower left side.]
;B[dk];W[fm];B[ll];W[kn];B[kp];W[im];B[jk]C[al> The latest five moves has increased black's areas immensly, while white has gained no points at all.

al> The reason this happened, I guess, is because white probably kept a narrow scope (protecting the white stones) instead of keeping an eye on the whole board. That is something that easily happen even to stronger players. So when you finally look up from the local skirmish to see the big picture, it comes as a shock that something like this has happened unnoticed.]
;W[kg]C[al> This is the start of a sequence that provides for a good catch up, but unfortunately it is a little to late for it to affect the outcome of the game.

al> I hope my comments have helped a bit in understanding how it happened. A stronger player than me might have another opinion, though.
