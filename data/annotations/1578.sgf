C[Reviewed by: cricket: C

C. At first glance, it seems you tried to make center territory with your influence, rather than using it to fight.

Attack weak groups. The strength you gain in the process is more positive than his defense, and can be used to attack or consolidate in other areas (helps you keep initiative).  Early on, white has a group open to attack, but you let him defend it first.   Take real territory over iffy attacks. White stakes out a framework, and then simply defends it. Your attacks (against stronger rather than weaker groups) doesn't shift the balance of score, and eventually lets him take the big points.   I hope this has been helpful. --cricket]
;B[pd]C[Note for the reviewer.

I played black.

I lost this game, partly because I missed
a couple of moves that gave W a
possibility to place clever attacks On
the other hand, I thought I had a good
position on the board, particularly in
the early middle game, with the centre
for me, but could not turn it to a
descisive advantage.

What I am keen on being advised is the
general aspect of my playing which needs
the most improvement (defending is
obviouly one to me, but you could have a
different opinion)

C. I would actually say attacking is more important, but attacking weakness, not strength. There is a couple of defending moves that could have been made earlier, but White didn't really exploit these weaknesses. More in the review...]
;W[cp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq];W[qf];B[qe]LB[qj:A]TR[qp][oq]C[C. Normally this works best if you have a pincer stone already in place around A (R10) or so.  This way, white's extension is cramped. As it is, he gets a nice postion. It's a fair exchange.    Extending from your enclosure (marked)  to around A would pincer him, retain initiative, and build your opening better.]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[pj];B[ql]C[C. good. same idea mentioned, and his high stone left this open to you.]
;W[ep];B[de]C[C. Good];W[cd]C[This seems small to me.

C. I agree. Same as the right side, but with opposite colors. He should have extended from his enclosure to pincer you, I think.]
;B[ce];W[gc];B[ec]C[C. Perhaps extending to erase his enclosure influence on this left side, and also solidify your group's base would be better. You can save this move for later.]
;W[eb];B[dd];W[cc];B[fc];W[fb];B[dj]TR[ec][gc]LB[ed:A]C[C. good.  This extension (or one space smaller) could have been made before E17 (marked). As it is, the "wall" you have right now has the defect at A (E16) adn white's G17 stone (marked) is threatening to make this wall of little use. Perhaps this shows why I like the extension for move 17.
I still like Black's situation.];W[iq];B[jd]TR[gc]C[C. This seems high.  You are low in the lower right corner. White has a balanced lower left corner, and a low upper left corner, and you have a high upper right corner and a high left side position. So, balance would suggest a low move here.  Also, with white's position with g17, he can undermine your stone readily. K or L17 would set up a good framework on the top, and leave two big territory moves on the board (left and bottom) and white has the attackable group on the right. Black would be in good shape.]
;W[ld];B[le]TR[jd][gc]C[C. If this is necessary, then K16 was certainly bad for black. Contacting this way admits you feel weak here. n15 would threaten both of white's groups, but may not be possible with K16 (marked) in danger of being cut off by white moving with g17 (marked).]
;W[kd];B[ke];W[jc];B[id];W[ic];B[hc];W[hb];B[hd];W[gd];B[ge]
;W[ed];B[ee]LB[fe:A]C[C. A (F15) would be stronger than this, preventing White's next move which puts weakness in black's wall. Not necessarily sente, but more sente than the result.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[fd];B[hf]TR[qf][pf][pj]C[I was ok with this development.

Is this opinion wrong in any way ?

C. Let's assess the whole board.  White:  A17-M19 (30),   r14-r11 (5, weak),  A4-J1 (25)

Black:
r15-o16 (15 soft)
p3-r8 (25)
c15-d10 (15) + high wall.

So, broadly speaking, White has a slight territory lead and black has a big wall, and white has a weak group on the board, and there are still 2 big territory points left  (around c7/8 and m3).  Blacks' biggest weakness is the upper right group which can be invaded but he might hesitate if it would further weaken the white q14 group (marked).  Attack white's weak group, driving it into Black's wall, looking for a way to strengthen the corner, or take a territory point during the attack.  Since it is white's move, I would expect him to fix his weak group, and look to attack your weakest corner (upper right), and end up with sente to take a big territory point (most likely the one on the left, to aim at undermining your high position on that side).]
;W[lq]C[C. so, he takes a territory point (reasonable) asking you to see what you can do with his weak group.]
;B[dm]C[This was obviously too high. Should have
been C7, but I was looking at D5 and G4
points.

was it unappropriate ?

C. This is okay, if you want to make center territory (which seems to be on your mind), but I would play lower for the territory. I would still attack his weak group on the right. The resulting stones you play as you chase him into the center would make it more obvious where you should play, and might also support and invasion/reduction around the g3/4 point.]
;W[bm];B[cm];W[bk];B[bj]TR[cm]C[C. It might have saved time to have made this move instead of the marked move (c7).]
;W[ck];B[cj];W[bn];B[dk]C[C. Your staying where white is finished. Still time to attack him on the right with s10 or r/q 12 or something.]
;W[qk]C[C. Now white defends.];B[ol];W[rl];B[qm];W[oo];B[nn]
;W[no];B[mo];W[np];B[mn];W[mp];B[ng]LB[rf:A]C[This was also for a sequence where I
would play G4, then F6, to prevent being
cut.

C. G4 would at least be more aggressive. s14 (A), to settle your corner and then go after his big bottom group.  From our earlier assessment, all that has changed is white has solidified his weak group some, reduced your territory a bit on the left and lower right (increasing his a bit as well). So, black is not making progress.
Still close enough game.];W[mj];B[gp]C[I played it anyway.

C. Definately would have been better before white's N10. This still looks playable.]
;W[gq];B[fp];W[fq];B[fn];W[oh];B[jj]C[C. You probably do need this center territory, and you do have some good walls facing the center. However, it's very difficult, and I think you could have put white on the run earlier to better effect.]
;W[ki];B[ji];W[kh];B[jh];W[hp];B[eo];W[gn];B[dp];W[eq];B[dq]
;W[cq];B[dr];W[fm]
(;B[em]TR[fn][eo][fp][gp][gn][fm]SQ[dp][dq][dr]C[First mistake. Should have been C5

C. Yes, now that you've exchanged the f/g4 stones (triangles) and the white intrusion for this corner penetration, it's critical to hang on to those stones (squares). E7 feels like your worried about keeping the exchange stones, or about white being able to cut your invasion stones apart (which c5 cures)
The weak stones (triangles) were not important from the time white played G6. They're small compared to your disruption of his territory. Trying to hang on to them gave this corner back to white.]
;W[go]C[C. White gives Black another chance.]
(;B[fo]TR[dr][dq][dp]C[C. these stones aren't worth saving, the corner stones are more important. C5 is still playable, and would be much better.]
;W[do];B[en];W[co]C[C. Notice that white has not really taken as much as simply beaten back your attacks, and therefore consolidated his own framework. He's made his potential into reality. You haven't so much lost ground as much as you've not taken anything away from white, nor consolidated anything solid for yourself.]
;B[gm];W[hm];B[gl];W[hn];B[io]LB[hl:A]C[C. This solidifies white without helping you. If you want that center territory, just turn at h8 (A). s14 is still a solid place to play too, that corner is still pretty weak.
This stone actually becomes burdensome later on (if not now)]
;W[in];B[jo];W[ho];B[kn]TR[io]C[C. This gote move highlights the weakness of the J5 (marked) play. Normally such a peek would be a forcing play, but now that it's gote, it's like "pass"ing in the middle of the game.]

(;W[oc]C[C. Here it finally comes. There are a variety of ways for White to invade this corner, especially with all the help he has on the outside.]

(;B[pc]C[I played it safe];W[nc];B[od];W[md];B[me];W[mc]TR[rf]
[be][hl][rm][mr][pb]C[C. You actually did okay here, keeping the corner, since white wanted the side more.   What's the score? White has solidified and expanded his areas, and you have lost a little ground, but made a nice center area.   White:  Upper & left- 30
Right- 15
Left & bottom- 35
Black:
Upper right - 10
Lower right - 15
Middle and left - 45

10 points can be made up in the endgame, but white certainly will have an easier time than black from here on.  I've marked where I'm looking for key ares for endgame moves for either player.
The more I look, the more I'm convinced White can hold the lead pretty easily. It would take a special move or a mistake to turn the tide, it seems.]
;B[jq];W[jr];B[kq];W[kr];B[mr];W[lr];B[pk]C[C. There are simpler moves around the board. H8, b15, q18, s15 are all areas where black and white both want to play for solid endgame points.]
;W[ok];B[rk];W[pl];B[qj]C[C. this seems to expect too much. White actually let you off fairly easy.]
;W[pk];B[rm]
(;W[rj];B[sl];W[qi]C[C. White doesn't need to capture this stone, especially if he plays against the top right corner, backing himself up while threatening your corner, and taking an endgame point.]
;B[pm]C[This sequence was not very satisfactory

C. Actually, it turned out well for you. However, you were right to note that the move that started this wasn't ideal, and really opened you up to some bad stuff, so black is happy to take this point now, so White doesn't get it..]
;W[qo];B[pp];W[po];B[ro];W[om];B[nl]C[C. Not sure this stone is worth saving when the other stones are in danger of being cut off. p6, or something around l8 (or both) might help get connected faster, leaving p8 on it's own.]
;W[on]
(;B[lk]LB[jl:A][kl:B]C[C. This seems more interested in territory (which doesn't exist here) than with connecting. k8 (A) seems to connect the fastest. L8 (B) was my first choice, but it seems cuttable (variations from previous node)]
;W[kj];B[kk];W[jk]C[C. this is very fun for white, he has nothing at risk, and is able to poke at black with this potentially serious cut. If all he gets is a bit of black's territory in the center, he'll just be increasing his lead.]

(;B[jl]TR[jk]C[I played this, because I was not sure I
could live in the centre by playing J9,
and being cut

C. This looks dangerous. Perhaps it's required at this point. Allowing the cut was too dangerous.]
;W[ik];B[il];W[hl];B[hk];W[gk]C[But I had not seen this, I played too
fast.];B[ij]TR[hj]C[C. better to extend to H10 (marked). Stones are still captured, and h10 will help contain this better.]
;W[fl];B[fj];W[gj];B[gi];W[hj];B[hi];W[sj];B[lj]TR[be][rf][pb]
LB[og:A][kg:B]C[C. This doesn't seem to take much real territory. the areas around b15, q18 and s14 (marked) are all solid moves still. If you like this part of the board, p13, or L13 (A, B) do more in the points department than this.]
;W[li];B[mi];W[mh];B[ni];W[nh]
(;B[nj];W[lp]C[C. this weakness has been here for some time, but I'm not sure the best way to fix. Everything I looked at felt so painfully slow. L5 keeps the stones, although it looks like bad shape, the double-bamboo joint seems to minimize the damage.]
;B[jp]TR[jn][ko]C[C. unfortunately, this just puts more stones into the pot that is vulnerable to the k6/l5 weakness (marked)]
;W[nk];B[mk];W[nm];B[ml];W[mm];B[lm];W[ko]C[Again, a good W move !]
;B[jn];W[ln];B[kg]C[C. Good, you still got this after all.]
;W[lh];B[bd]C[C. Yeah!];W[bc];B[ae];W[ac];B[og]C[C. Good];W[pg]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[rd]C[C. Why not simply connect with s15?];W[mg]
;B[nf];W[sf];B[re];W[sk];B[rl]LB[ob:A][nr:B][rp:C][rn:D]C[C. this seems small.  If you are threatened in this corner, this is not the best move to defend.  If you don't feel threatened, this small ko is smaller than p18 or o2 (A, B)  type moves.
The s4 and s6 (C, D) weakness probably means you have to defend those points instead of connecting here.]
;W[rn]C[Again, I had a flaw in the shape :-(

I let the group go, because I was afraid
of losing more (see variation)

C. Your variation is what I feared too, but Ithink it can be saved. See variation for continuation.]
