C[woj:  Thank you for reviewing my game!

I
lost this game by a small margin (1.5 points), and I don't see any
obvious mistakes on either side.  I would appreciate any advice as to
where I could make more efficient moves.

funaru:
Hello, I'm a 11kyu from Germany. I'm the rewiever and I hope you will learn through my suggestions.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[dj];W[ce];B[dn]LB[cn:A]C[funaru:
It's common to attack a 4-4-point from the 3. row, because that does look more into the corner and it pays well to attack it.]
;W[nc]
(;B[qg]LB[pf:A]C[funaru:
this
is a bit too far I think, normally you play at "A", because it makes it
harder for white to invade and gives room for some simple josekis.]
;W[qc]LB[qd:A]C[funaru:
See my variation.]
(;B[pc]C[woj:  I wanted to separate white's stones, and perhaps stop him from getting the corner.

funaru:
I
belive in this situation it's better not to seperate, because black R13
is too far away to kill white easily and you havn't the chance to build
a moyo at the higher right now, if white lives. I think my variation is
better for you, because it is much easier to play.];W[qd];B[qe]
;W[re];B[rf];W[pb];B[rd]LB[pe:A]C[funaru: 
Already now white is able to cut at "A". See the variation.]

(;W[ob]LB[qb:A]C[woj:  I wasn't expecting this move.  Was this move good for white?

funaru:
This was obviously not good, because there is a way to kill him beginning with "A"! See the variation.
I
think this sequence is better for black, he gets influence and not only
a few points on the first and second row, but he loses sente because he
has to defend the cut.]
(;B[rc];W[qb];B[pe]C[woj:  Had to reinforce.  A cut by white at Q15 would be bad.

funaru:
Right, but this cut was possible sooner!
In
most cases its better to catch a stone like S15 immediately if it might
be able to threat you around later. if S15 is catched, the cut is not
so a big thread.];W[jd];B[pk];W[qn]LB[qo:A]SQ[pk]C[funaru:
White should care about D4 bevore invading. 
My variation "A" for black is a little more agressive.
If there is no pincer Q9, "A" would be a bad move, because it enables white to gain a strong establishment.]

(;B[qp]C[woj:  I wasn't sure which way white wanted to invade here, so I reinforced the corner just in case.

funaru:
Encolsing the corner this way is a very solid move, not bad in my eyes.]
;W[ql];B[qk];W[on];B[np];W[lq];B[jp];W[lo];B[nn]LB[oo:A]C[funaru:
Attacking this way is not very good, because if white plays P5, the black formation has two cuts and can only connect one.]
;W[rk]
(;B[rj]LB[pm:A]C[funaru:
The same for white, the stones around q7 are kind of unstable. Bad shape a dan would say.]
;W[rm];B[sk];W[rl];B[pm]C[funaru:
Might
look good, but this is too late now, because it's near to whites
strenght and too far from your own stones: It enables white to escape.
If you want to attack a grop of stones that has not enoug eyes first
play outside. This way you can  prevent that he runs away and gets life
through connecting.];W[pl];B[om];W[ol];B[nm];W[sl];B[sj];W[ro]
;B[rp]LB[nk:A][sn:B]C[woj:  Was this move a mistake? Could I have killed white's group if I played T6 instead?

funaru: 
i don't think so, because white does have the opporturnity to escape out at O9.]
;W[sn]
(;B[qo];W[qm];B[nk]C[woj:  I realized too late that playing here wouldn't help me much.

funaru:
Only P10 is solid enough, because it doesn't enable to cut for white.]
;W[ok];B[oj]C[funaru:
This formation gives white the eventuallity to cut at R10.]

(;W[nl];B[mk]C[woj:  I know that N8 would be bad, but would N7 be better that N9?

funaru:
Never, it leaves another cut. 
You have to care about his many cuts! An additional one would be worse. Expanding is ok, but think about the cuts at the right.]

(;W[ml]LB[fq:A]TR[jp]C[funaru:
The
marked black stone is very week at the moment, but if you play similar
to the variation, it may become strong and make some territory.]

(;B[cq]C[woj:  White was looking pretty secure at the top, so I decided to start invading at the bottom left.

funaru: 
Usually you don't invade if you have the opporturnity to attack from outside.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[gq];B[cp];W[dq];B[do];W[ci];B[di];W[cj];B[ck]
;W[cg];B[gd]C[woj:
Now that I had a bit of a base on the left side, I decided to invade at
the top.  I figured that I could connect to the left side if things
went badly.

funaru: 
Not a bad idea, but the way to the left
stones is very far. white can play someting like H13 to stop black. But
you managed it to get a nice bambus and to get 2 eyes anyway.]
;W[jc];B[ed];W[dd];B[ec];W[hc];B[gc];W[eb];B[fb]TR[fb][ec][gc]
[ed][gd]C[funaru:
This formation is called bambus.
It lives in every case, because black can on the one hand catch the stone
or on the other hand bould an eye at the right. This variety is
important, it forces the opponent to choose, but no matter what he
chooses, it's good for you.];W[db];B[hb];W[ib]LB[ga:A]C[funaru:
You should play "A" to make 2 eyes.];B[hd];W[id]LB[ga:A]C[funaru:
 "A" is still possible.];B[ha]C[funaru:
Stretching is not good in most cases.];W[ia]C[funaru:
The variation shows what might happen if w wins the ko.]
(;B[ic];W[jb];B[hc]C[woj:
I filled in the ko since fighting it didn't seem to give me any
benefit.  Should I have used this opportunity to play somewhere else
instead?  E13?  G4?  M8?

funaru:
At any rate you should not fill this ko! it's not worth to fight, because fighting for the Ko is only worth one point for both sides! Even if black loses the Ko, in worst case you have to run a bit for a second eye.

E13 is not good, because white can easily take e15. Black playing there would be nice.

G4 is cutable to easy, J6 or H5 are more solid.

M8 leaves another cut on this side, it makes it possible for white to cut and to destroy everything black had build there.

My suggestion is D2 at first, it's a big forehand. 
After that, something around N15 seems to be very big, N3 encloses the corner for sure and white has to care about cuts.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[eg];B[fh];W[fg];B[hf]C[woj:
Pushing slowly at G13 didn't look good, so I decided to try to block
white's advance.

funaru:
G12 might seem small, but it's very solid, but this takes white the opportunity to play G2, because black can cut him easily.
So I figure H14 is a good move.]
(;W[ne];B[gp]C[funaru:
This
attaching is not a good shape. Attaching is bad in most cases, because
the enemy is always one turn ahead with his following attacks. In this
case I would recommend to play h6 if you and your enemy are not going
to make it complex.];W[jq]C[funaru:
If white doesn't answer this declaration of war, black should attack! F4 or E4 are nice now.]

(;B[kp];W[kq];B[lp];W[lm];B[mo];W[ln]LB[mq:A]C[funaru:
N3 is important! If black doesn't play it white might jump deep in blacks territory.]

(;B[gg]C[funaru:
Anyway, this is big, but as you see later, white can push black's moyo smaller from the center.]
;W[fp];B[go];W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[og];W[ng];B[nh];W[qf]
(;B[se]C[woj:  Took the stone because I was worried about white playing S13.  Was this premature?

funaru:
If you look at the cut at r10 it could end worse than before if you don't
take. For the group above there is no danger, because even alone it has
2 sure eyes.];W[mg];B[oe];W[nf];B[mh];W[lg];B[lh];W[kg];B[jf]
;W[jg];B[ig];W[ke];B[jh];W[lk]C[funaru:
Black has build huge walls, he should use them to catch territory! For examle: L8 is very big now! See my variations.]

Endearing by white. He might have gone further.];B[nq];W[mp]
;B[hq];W[hr];B[hp];W[gr];B[im]LB[ik:A]C[woj:
Looking at the board, I saw that I had a big open area in the lower
left, and no real means of attacking white's groups. So, I decided to
start grabbing as much territory there as I could.  Was this an
effective move?

funaru: 
With so big walls, black is able to play higher, like J9.];W[ik]
;B[jl];W[jk];B[kl];W[ll];B[gl];W[pn]C[funaru:
This is no forehand! For black: Don't answer airy!];B[no]C[funaru:
