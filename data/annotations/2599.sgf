C[Hi.

In this game I played black and won by 1.5 pts. I think it was quite an even game, and actually after we played it, my opponent and I agreed that anyone could have won it. Please, could you review for both sides? I'm interested in knowing what's the better and worse that I do. I'd also like to hear opinions about direction of play.

Thanks

PS: I'll start my comments with pajaro:

I'll start mine with djna:


djna: My summary:

Pretty exciting game, going right down to the yose. W made early mistakes in the joseki and got a slightly inferior position. B lost the thread in the late middle game and W began to build on a very large scale.

W gave B an opportunity by over-extending and B made a brave invasion. W needed to get a little more profit from that invasion than he managed.

I don't think W did all that much wrong after the opening. He probably needed to find something more interesting against the bottom right corner in order to win in the yose.

B seems to undervalue "the outside". There were several occasions where either he didn't seem to mind getting shut in, or had the opportunity to confine W and didn't take them. He also tended to get fixated on a plan (the top in particular) and lose sight of what was happening over the whole board.]
;B[pd];W[dc]C[pajaro: W offered diagonal fuseki. I think it's supposed to be better for black, but I didn't play it because I don't use to.

djna: Hmm didn't know that it was better for either player, if it was W would never let it happen! I think it's more that diagonal tends to make for a more fragmented, and hence fighting game. So some players *really* like diagonal games. 

These sort of early decisions shouldn't really matter too much. Play what you prefer, or deliberately choose things you don't usually play as an experiment.]
;B[pq];W[dp];B[fq];W[hp]LB[dj:A][cn:D][fo:B][cq:C]C[pajaro: What about this pincer? I usually find it hard to see the relation between pincers and moves in other corners.


djna: Me too. I never really feel like I know what's going on. In other words, don't worry too much if it seems difficult in this kind of situation.

Here you need to decide whether to grant W a large wall or keep the pincer and corner separate. If W had a stone around A I think that allowing him a wall would be too good for him. Here, it seems to be less obvious. My instinct is to play the one point jump to B but look at the variation and see  what you think.

Having looked at the variations for the josekis from B and C I do think that both tend to favour Black, so I'm less keen on the pincer for W. I would recommend D for W. Just get a foothold and look to play first in the top right.]

(;B[cq];W[cp]C[pajaro: Is this a mistake? I would have blocked in the other direction.]
;B[dq]C[
djna: I think this is OK for B, W gets the joseki slightly wrong, see the variation]

(;W[fo]LB[ep:A]C[
djna: W probably has the joseki following a low pincer in mind.

W should look at A and wonder why he didn't play there.];B[ep]
;W[eo]C[
djna: Seems a natural, but slightly crude exchange. Is there something better? I cannot see it.

One idea is just to play E3. now W either has leave weakness or spend a move, and if he does spend a move the's not as strong as in the joseki.]
;B[bp]C[
djna: Tricky to know whether to play the exchange. I would have.]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[co]C[pajaro: Now I think that I shouldn't have played the last exchanges. W is strong and B feels a little bad aji around E3.

djna: I agree that W seems to have been not as punished as we wish, but he
is not quite as strong as in the joseki - D6 is pretty much sente and W has no sente move against the corner. *and* B has sente to reduce the meaning of the W wall.]

(;B[de]C[pajaro: Because of the wall, I thought I had to play in the left side. Right? Or is this side still too open?

djna: certainly I'd play over here. FInding a good point is tricky. W has a wall
radiating up there and he wants to play away from that thickness.

Black has allowed W a pincer at more or less at the ideal disatnce.

I think B should play as in the variation.];W[cg]LB[dh:A]C[

djna: The right sort of idea by W.  This pincer is troublesome so that's why approachingn ythe corner is probably a bad idea.]

(;B[cc]C[

djna: the joskei starting here are pretty easy to foul up.]
;W[dd];B[cd]C[
djna: the joseki move is shown in the variation]
(;W[cb]
(;B[cf]C[

djna: This seems really natural, but W's answer tends to spoil the shape. I have an outlandish suggestion for an alternative - see the variation.]
;W[dg];B[bb];W[db];B[ee];W[fd]
(;B[fc]LB[fc:A][ed:B][fe:C]C[
djna: This looks like the sort of move strong players do when they destroy a weaker players shape. However, as far as I can see this move doesn't seem to work. The effect is just to make W stronger.

Big question for B here: which W response did you consider? What was your plan as a follow up?

If W played something unexpected, then OK. We all makes reading errors. But surely B was the "obvious" response?

I you were expecting B then what was the follow up? If  it was the move you played, C, then consider this idea (originally from Matthew MacFadyen) Consider just playing C Often just playing the "C" of any A, B, C sequence works better and leave more possibilities.

I];W[ed];B[fe];W[gd];B[fh]LB[jc:A]CR[fc]C[

djna: so far so good. The trick now is to be prepared to allow W to have some territory. He has invested a lot of stones, it's only fair! I think it goes slightly wrong when you try to deny him virtually anything! If B gets sente to play near A then this is good and that "bad" marked stone  might just come back into play.]
;W[dj]TR[ac][bc][ad][bd][ae][be][ar][br][cr][dr][er][as][bs]
[cs][ds][es]SQ[ai][bi][ci][aj][bj][cj][ak][bk][ck][al][bl][cl]
[dl][am][bm][cm][dm][cn][dn]C[
djna:  Probably as good as W can do. Anything is going to leave weaknesses.


B and W have virtaully identical territory. If B now plays at thye top he should get more than W up there, so he's fine.

Instead ...];B[ci]C[

djna: another "strong player "move!

Now I must admit that W looks like he's got some weakness there, and if this works then you have to go for it.  However you need to have done enough analysis to justify moves like this. I'm not convinced that this is the case here.]
;W[di]
(;B[bg]TR[ci]C[
djna: If black plays like this then he should not have played the marked stone.
(the A, B, C idea again) Instead he can in fact play as shown in the variation.]
;W[bh];B[ch]C[

djna: this seems too exciting! I don't B needs to fight like this in order to get a good result. Suppose W plays the variation>]

(;W[bf]C[
djna: OK things are now getting pretty complicated.];B[dh]C[

djna: a tough move];W[be]TR[eg]
(;B[ce]C[
djna. B is is danger of getting a floating group with no eyes, I prefer the variatins.]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[bd];B[fg];W[bi];B[cj]C[pajaro: Now the white leftside is gone...

djna: Yes, that's a good feature. The difference from my prefered variation is that the B stones have no eye shape and hence can't so easily be used to influence fights starting on the right.]

(;W[bc]C[pajaro: ... and this seems an overplay. Black could just get o gote eye there, and if W feels bad, he could just play B10.

djna: An overplay would be too agressive. You mean that he's being too cautious.

see the variation for my opinion.];B[dk]CR[bc]C[

djna:  it is frustrating to have to play this. B'd shape is not so good and so I can understand the urge to play here. 

In the end I view it in much the same light as W's marked move, sometime you have to play the solid thing rather than leave behind weakesses, so  "slow but good" is my verdict.]
;W[nc]C[
djna: Tricky for W to know where to play now.

My way of thinking is that one thing we don't want is for B to build a large right side, that may be difficult to reduce. W is now so strong at the top that he really would like a scrap up there so I'd approach the bottom right.]
;B[lc]C[pajaro: Again, the upper side seemed to be too big to let W get it, so I pincered.

djna: I'd hope to grow the right as fast as W grows the top, so I'm slightly doubtful about this pincer. It's rather starting yet another group where W is strong.]

(;W[jc]C[
djna: but W plays a very generous move. H takes a few points but allows his approach stone to be swallowed.

I've looked at alternatives for this move];B[nd]C[
djna: excellent];W[oc];B[od];W[qb]LB[rc:A];B[mc]LB[rc:A]TR[lc]
C[
djna : I'd prefer A. The way I see it B here is focussing on destroying W's top rather than building down the left. Now the marked stones are gong to get very strong soon but black ends up with a spoiling group and no real growth potential. Now if the top left W group were open to attack then the stringth of the marked stones is pretty useful. Here it's power without a good use.]
;W[rd]C[
djna: W's shape is messy but he's undermining black's potential so this is OK]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[pb];W[pc];B[nb];W[qd];B[ob]LB[pf:A]TR[nc][oc]
[pc]C[
djna the three W stones are now not too important unless the whole B group can be attacked. W can probably play A now instead of connecting.]
;W[qc]C[pajaro: corner vs position in the side. Fair exchange for both?

djna: now you have sente it's OK, but W missed a trick by connecting.

The thing you're not valuing is the potential for growth ...]

(;B[qo]C[pajaro: At this point, everything seems to be strong. So I just go for a big point.

djna yes, but confining W to a low position is worth a lot. See the variation.]
;W[le];B[md];W[gq];B[fr];W[gr];B[fp];W[go]TR[pf][qf]C[

djna: W plays some decent sente

I now see the marked points as pivotal. The B group up there has a strange status, it's not clear what it's *for*. it could become strength or a burden.]
;B[kd]LB[qf:A]SQ[le]C[
djna: I really don't like this move. 

The top is not interesting - just a few points to argue over. 

The marked W stone is just a kikashi stone. W can happily give it up.

B almost seems to be running away.  That's no good.

Play A and see what happens.];W[lg];B[jd]C[
djna: too slow. Perhaps obsessed with the top?

W's next move is big.];W[mp];B[mr]C[

djna: B is now playing reactive moves.];W[lq];B[ic];W[qi]C[
djna: in this phase W is playing big moves and is swinging the game back in his favour]
;B[gc]C[
djna: A very bad move. Has taken a small number of points but in srategic termshas added an eye to a live B group and taken an eye from a W group that had at least 5 eyes. 

I think that this last few moves by B are the ones that B needs to look at compare with where W played.]
;W[qm]LB[pf:B][fk:D][ql:A][lr:C]C[

djna : The game is now at an interesting stage.

I think W should have played A. By my estimate the scores are quite close after that,
*but* W has potential in several places to grow territory. Moves such as B, C and D all expand W considerably. In contrast black has virtually no such big points.

It is this lack of potential that defines the problem with B's strategy.]
;B[qk]TR[le][lg][qi][qm]C[pajaro: I invaded because the extension seemed too lon for me. Can wait expect a big result if I don't invade, considering the black position around Q16?

djna: As I've explained I see the game as swinging towards W. So yes, something active is needed This seems like a reasonable idea. The B plan is to pressure some of the marked stones so that W does not get chance to convert his potential. That pair of stones at the top could get swallowed up on a large scale.

But the B stone could also come under pressure, so things are now "interesting"!]
;W[pl]C[
djna: Yes,.

Note how the W centre is threatening to grow now.];B[qg]LB[pj:A]
C[
djna: it's far too hard to analyse all the possibilities at this point.

By general feeling is that playing vague moves like these shows that you don't really have a plan. I'd be more inclined to stick with my original invasion stone perhaps playing A.]
;W[pf];B[ri]C[
djna: this is very dangerous, W could allow B a little live group on the side and wall off the whole centre.]
;W[qj];B[rj];W[qh];B[rh];W[pk];B[pg];W[rf];B[oi]C[pajaro: This is a misread. White can cut at S13, because Q10-S9 miai.

djna: yes this all pretty complicated. I would happily give up the stones on the edge for a well connected group in the centre.]
;W[rk];B[rg]LB[of:A]C[
djna: why do you care about three stones?

Play A and ask W what he's going to do about his two stones?]
;W[of];B[pj]LB[nj:A]C[

djna Is there time for this? Suppose W plays around A? By the time you've lived W has a huge centre.]
;W[ql]C[
djna: ??? why ???];B[qf];W[qe]C[pajaro: With this forcing exchange, B has the Q15 cut in reserve. Is it worth the liberty he loses?

djna: no. It's your privilege to play it whenever you like, B cannot play there in sente. So you lose a ko threat]
;B[ng];W[nf];B[mg];W[mf];B[nj];W[og]LB[mk:A]C[
djna: I think W should be playing on the outside of black, say at A]
;B[ph];W[nh];B[ni]C[
djna: Black is getting out, and getting eyes.];W[mh]C[

djna: is very irritating for W];W[mm]LB[qp:B][pr:A]C[
djna: the B group in the bottom right is substantially weakened now. I think that W can do a lot of damage by playing A with a threat of B. So I understand ...]
;B[lr]C[
djna: ... the urge to strengthen here, and it is pretty big.]
;W[ll]C[
djna: but black has to make sure this group is alive. So he really should have played here.]
