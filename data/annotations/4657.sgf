;B[gc]C[White is playing into an area of yours, so he should expect to take some loses, or make sacrifices.  It is no surprise that his group would come under such pressure from black.  G17 is a good move that is taking away white's base, and threatens co cut white in half. 

i was trying to be agressive. i thought that playing L16 was too soon and i could play it later because i felt w got to respond to g17.]
;W[fe]C[White must run now.]
(;B[kd]C[This is more important than making a moyo with q16.  See variation

now i feel that l16 play well with q16.];W[nd]C[Ruin what?  You have only a moyo, potential.  A moyo is meant to be invaded.  You need simply respond well.

he tries to ruin it.];B[pf];W[nf]
(;B[ph]C[This is likely the move that sent your opening into a spiral.  See variation]
;W[kf]C[Now the difference between black L14 and white L14 is crystal clear.  Q12 may be joseki (which I am not sure of), but actual play required L14

w established nice influence];B[eb]C[The tables turn, and black must make life :(]
;W[ch]C[Think about how damaging this move would be for white if the F15 had been made weak with L14.  This move would not be an option.  It works here now simply because white is stronger then black over there.

i think w c12 is very strong and nice direction with d4];B[jq]
C[Convince yourself that moyos are the potential for territory, not actual territory.  Every large moyo can be reduced if handled well later on.  However, losing an established group is hard to  come back from, so pressuring weak groups should be your priority.  Try to avoid playing jealousy go; the opponent will always get some points.

i play here thinking that with w influence at the top, c12, d4 and q4 a w move around k4 will give him a terrible advantage]
;W[ck]C[C12 was a weak stone; white made it stronger, and now he has a stronger group near black's weakening upper left corner.  D18 is looking nicer and nicer for white.  He may not be able to threaten life on either black group, but in seperating them, and forcing them both to make life on his terms, white can reduce the points earned by both substantially

isnt it better h3 than playing c9?];B[qm]C[This is good in that it starts to close the "door" underneath Q12 stones.  The long knight jump or the R8 might have worked better for that, but would be less effective as a openers for corner joseki.

i think i play this because i wanted to create my own influence with my 3 stones at the top and compete with w influence]
;W[qk]
(;B[ri]C[Don't guard your territory so jealously.  Why not P7 right away?  Think whole board, beyond the individual groups and the points you could get from them.]
;W[pj];B[om];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[mm]C[N7 is like L14 should have been.  White on both sides needing to make fixes on both sides, and with one move black focres white to make both of those fixes.  White however can only fix one, so black can turn the tables.

i dont know about n7. what do u think?];W[nj]C[See variation for what you could do from here.

that is why i dont like b 31.n7 i felt it didnt put pressure to w stones at the right side.]

(;B[nh];W[jo]
(;B[gq]C[Too defensive.  Spot weak groups and make them weaker.  See variation]
;W[dn];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[cp];B[fr];W[eq];B[es]
;W[bp]C[Now white has the left side almost for certain, and black got only a small bite of the corner.  Attack weakness from strength, and build up weak things to make them strong.  For example, attack O4 first, make yourself strong in that area, then attack the corner at D6 instead of letting white take that spot.]
;B[mr]C[Your group is in no danger of dying, but white's is if his corner gets cut off.  He can't tenuki if you play M4, as the corner would almost surely die in that case.  

trying to ruin w territory but im guessing his center is more important and urgent]
;W[lq];B[lr];W[kq];B[kr];W[jp];B[iq]C[White fixes the potential of M4 and he does so in sente, and by forcing you to stay low.  There is no better way to play.]
;W[ln]C[White even gets to correct a new problem, the cut at L4, with a nice move setting up to cap the n7 stone.]
;B[lj]C[N11 is the obvious flaw in this attemnpt to encase white.  What is the purpose of this move if not to encase white?  It certainly is not going to connect well to N7.  

Better to have played N10, and have played something that may work, rather them M10 which will surely not work.]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[mi];B[mj];W[ni];B[kj];W[lh];B[kl]C[Small.  Despite whats been said so far, black still look to be in nice shape to here.  That is if he can hold on to the upper right.  Q17 , Q18 could have been game winning.  They were sente also as N17 is a nice follow up that confirms another 5-10 points for black.]
;W[qc]C[Alas, white has seen the danger in allwoing you that corner, and invades before you secured it.]
