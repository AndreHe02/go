C[HY: Hi, I am your reviewer, Hamato Yoshi.  I am kgs 2 dan.  I will prefix my comments with HY.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[jp]LB[fc:D][jd:C][cj:A][cn:B]
[lp:E]TR[mp]C[HY: Your play at A is certainly understandable, and a good move, but also not the only move.  I have included some variations just so you can see some other ideas.

B is similar to A.  C and D take a position on top; the most peaceful variation leads to a battle of moyos.  E prevents white from playing on the triangle, which is large and sente.  All variations are ok for black to play.]

(;B[cj]C[I don't want my opponent take D10...];W[qo]LB[np:A]
[qp:B]C[HY: The most natural response is the kick at B.]
(;B[np]LB[mq:A][qq:B]C[HY: White A is a strange move.  White should take the easy life at B.]

(;W[mq];B[mp];W[lq]LB[qp:B][qq:A]C[HY: B is better than A.]

(;B[qq]C[I chose R3 becouse I want live in the corner and let white escape...]
;W[pm];B[ok]C[this wall is what I wanted...

HY: This is good.];W[nq];B[op];W[oq]LB[po:B][pp:A]C[HY: B is better than A.]

(;B[pp];W[nm];B[rp];W[mk];B[ml]LB[nl:B][mm:A]C[HY: Don't play this way without the ladder. White should cut at B.]

(;W[mm];B[nl];W[lm];B[ll];W[ol]LB[nk:A][pk:D][pl:B][on:C]C[HY: I think playing at B first is better in this case because the aji at C is not very useful anyway, so B isn't aji keshi and it prevents white D.]

(;B[nk];W[pk];B[pj];W[pl];B[oi];W[km]LB[gd:B][on:A]C[HY: Why peep at A, is it helpful? Your bottom right group is already alive and the white group at p8 is very strong, so there's no reason to play in this area. You should tenuki to a more important area, like B.]

(;B[on];W[pn];B[po];W[no]LB[gd:B][ro:A]C[HY: The move at A is unnecessary. Better to take sente like B.]

(;B[ro];W[rn];B[rr]C[HY: White should take sente here.];W[pr]
;B[qr];W[or];B[dn]C[I need to reduce white power in this area...

HY: Yes, this area is big. Top left area is also big. Either area seems ok to me.]
;W[gp]LB[gd:B][cq:A]C[HY: Your play at A is very big, but I think now taking the spot at B is bigger.]

(;B[cq]LB[cp:B][dq:A]C[HY: White should have blocked on the other side at B.]

(;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[co];W[en];B[dm];W[em]C[this isn't good i think...]
;B[fd];W[ec];B[fc];W[cg];B[jd];W[md]LB[oc:B][pc:A]C[HY: Again, B is better than A. B is more active.]

(;B[pc]LB[qe:B][qf:A]C[HY: If white had played at B it would have taken better advantage of your slow play at q17. Notice that if q17 was at p17, white B wouldn't force you into as much of a useless shape.]

(;W[qf]LB[of:A][qh:B]C[HY: Splitting at A is a good idea.  Another idea is B. There is actually still time to split because white can't connect the stones with just one move.]

(;B[of]C[I try to split these 2 stones];W[qj]C[HY: This is a strange move from white, abandoning both the r14 and n16 stones. Your sacrifice of r9 is the right way to play.]
;B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[rk];B[kf];W[ph];B[pi];W[og]LB[pf:B][ng:A]
C[HY: B is an important shape point for white, you should take it.]

(;B[oh];W[pf];B[ng];W[oe];B[nf];W[pe]LB[qd:C][rd:B][ne:A]C[HY: It is important to play at B to deny white the eye at C.]

(;B[ne]C[disaster...];W[od];B[nd];W[oc];B[nc];W[pb];B[qb];W[nb]
LB[mb:B][mc:A]C[HY: You should play at B. There is still a lot of aji in the corner and white will probably have to take gote after black B.]

(;B[mc];W[mb];B[lb];W[qc];B[cc];W[cd];B[eb];W[dc];B[db];W[cb]
LB[bb:B][bc:A]C[HY: This move is not good. It reduces black's yose possibilities in the corner later at B.]

(;B[bc];W[bb];B[bd];W[be];B[de];W[ce];B[eg];W[df];B[ef];W[ee]
;B[fe];W[jk];B[kl]C[HY: There is a proverb: "Don't push what you can't cut." Since you can't cut here, it's better not to push. Save the aji for later.]
;W[jl];B[ji];W[kj];B[jj];W[kk];B[el]C[Good, this is big.];W[fl]
LB[ek:A][fk:B]C[HY: You can double hane at B.]
(;B[ek];W[fk]LB[fi:A][dr:B]C[HY: B is a very large yose move.]

LB[cm:B][bn:A]C[HY: You can save everything if you play at B instead of A.]

(;B[bn];W[cm];B[dl];W[bm]LB[bl:A][am:B][bo:C]C[I've already lost the game...
anyway, is there a way to save everything or I have to sacrifice D6 and D7?

HY: You could have saved everything earlier (move 209), but now the best you can get is ko or seki. See variations on B and C.]
