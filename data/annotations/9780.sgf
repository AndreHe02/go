 micha 10k : 129 hi

Hello, I'm Julien 2k.
I will review your game by adding comments and variations.
I hope you will enjoy this review.];B[dd]C[

;B[kc]C[i like it when my opponent allows me to make chinese+kobayashi
but usually after the moyo is more developed i get an invasion at R8 that i dont know how to respond too

JS: yes, I like this opening too. White is very kind to play this way ;-).]

(;W[od];B[pf]C[i  also considered P17 and Q17 i think they were better

JS: I think tthat this move is fine. You do not want to touch the weak stone.]
;W[of];B[og];W[nf]
(;B[ng]C[You have to protect your weakness at Q13.];W[mf];B[pc]
;W[fc];B[fd]TR[md]C[i usually dont play the attach and extend joseki i think it went well but later i looked it up in a dictionary joseki and realised white could have made problems in the corner after the cut (luckily he didnt)

JS: This joseki is only good when black has a stone around C10 or D10 and you want to build a moyo on the west side. Thus it is no good in this position.

Here I would have played N16 first to punish white tenuki which let him a weak group. Then I would probably have played H17 (it also depends on white's answer to N16).

The key idea here is to use the L17 stone to begin an attack against both F17 and O14. Attacking 2 weak groups is the best strategy ever.]
;W[gd];B[fe];W[ec];B[dc];W[jd];B[dj]C[Now it is your L17 which is weak :-(. It is a poor result for black.]
;W[lb]TR[jd][md]C[ive never seen this move before
im not sure what is the proper response.

JS: it is a bad move which let white in bad shape.

I think that the vital point is N16.]
(;B[cn]C[I think your move is also playable.];W[fp];B[on]C[defend the R8 weakness]
;W[mn];B[qq]TR[rp]C[in retrospect this is not a good move :)

;W[me];B[kd];W[mb];B[nc];W[je];B[kb];W[ke];B[pq]C[time to salvage what i can (i think my opponent should have killed it when he had the chance)

Yes he should ;-)];W[os];B[qr];W[ps];B[qs];W[ns];B[sp];W[mo]
;B[sr];W[ed];B[ee];W[de];B[gc]C[should be D18

JS: Yes D18 probably better.];W[gb];B[db];W[hc];B[df];W[ce]
;B[cf];W[cl]TR[dl]C[how to respond?

D8 is the more standard answer and is fine in this position. You will lost few points on the right but you will get a wall which counters white's big influence in the center (if I would have been white, I would have played D8 instead of C8).]

(;B[bk]TR[ag][bg][ah][bh][ai][bi][ci][ch][cg]C[i decided to save some points and later invade 3-3 and do some damage
attaching on the top seemed wastefull since i dont have anything to do with the wall

This move looks bad. It saves around 10 points while white will certainly get again influence in the center. You should worry about the white potential in the center.]

C[No more comment after this move since black has won the game.

I think you should take care of influence. Letting your opponent get points while getting influence is a good strategy and is often required. In this game, white lost because he did not manage the fight well, but he should have got a very large center and have won the game IMHO.

You should also take care of your own weakness: the cut at R13 (even if it did not end badly in this game), your L17 stone, before invading at R3, the C15 aji...

Hope this helps,
