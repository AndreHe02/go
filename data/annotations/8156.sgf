C[Jarstar [12k\]: hi!
Jarstar [12k\]: good luck, have fun
panda27 [12k\]: hi];B[pp]C[To reviewer:

Hi, I'm Jarstar (white).  What I need help most with is the opening.  I feel like once I get into middle and endgame, I do ok, but some moves catch me by surprise in the opening and I'm at a loss as to how to respond.

Any feedback whatsoever will be greatly appreciated!


To Jarstar:

In theory, opening is easiest to work on for amateurs compared to middle game and end game-- mostly to learn to sense directions and to memorize josekis. Tips from a dan-player is that to work on basic josekis and to study basic theories about directions.
Good luck!];W[dd];B[co];W[dq]C[Mattias> I would not jump in there directly. One reason for black to play on 3-5 is that he want you to answer at 4-3 or somewhere in that area. He probably have experience on this, and one possible consequence is that black can get white into some complicated joseki in order to get sente and play at upper-right corner. 

So I would play in the empty corner first and see what happens later. If black plays D3, then it would be the same as D3-C5 sequence (normal opening); if black plays elsewhere, then you can play D3 or E3]
;B[cq];W[cr];B[bq]C[Mattias> Just for you to know, this is not joseki. Black's position is too low.]
;W[dp]C[Mattias> Good move. D4 makes Shape for both parties.]
;B[gq]C[This seems like an overplay on black's part, and I wanted to try to exploit the weaknesses of the three stones.

Mattias> Yes this is overplay and you should search for a way to get the upper hand.]
(;W[cm]C[Mattias> Compared to the left group, the G3 stone is weaker and easier to attack. So that's why it is not so wise to attack the stronger side first.]

(;B[pd];W[nc];B[pc]LB[jd:A][qf:C][qg:B]C[This is an unfamiliar joseki to me.  What is a good response in this case?

Mattias> Just take A and then black has to answer at B (Otherwise white can play C and it's severe). It's as if black played B first and get back playing Q17 later, which is a big endgame/middlegame move, but not an opening move.]

(;W[bm]C[Mattias> Black cannot and will not live on line 2 now, so it's better to control the direction at D8]

Black had three weak groups in the beginning but white didn't manage to benefit much from attacking. White only got around 10 points in the middle and it took a lot of moves to build it, while black played several big endgame moves.

So I would suggest you to work on the direction of play a bit more. 

It is a very good game for 12k. Good luck!])
