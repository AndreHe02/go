Hi - I know that you are black in this game.  In addition to
commenting on your moves I have provided a few comments when
white could have done something better.

This was a fighting game.  I have heard professionals commenting
about amateur's games and they ALL say the same thing:  we fight
too much - we take chances that they wouldn't dream of taking
(although we don't realize  that we are playing so reckelssly).

That was certainly the case here -- black won by a large margin
but both sides had severe weaknesses that were not exploited.

Please contact me w/ questions if there is some part of the game
I did not review to your satisfaction.  Thanks for being part
of the go teaching ladder.

Do you know the purpose of playing P16? These days it is thought
of as a slow move, best used when you need to just be defensive
(see variation for an example)

In this case you are strong locally so you should be putting
pressure on white.  Playing at A would work nicely with your
marked stones.];W[rc];B[fc]LB[qj:B][pf:A]C[Is this a good move 
for black in this situtation?

Good question.  Seems ok to me.  I would also consider pressing
white down with A.  Extending at B may be ok as well.];W[hc]

(;B[fe]C[Was it good for black to run like this? or is there somthing
better?

Jumping out is ok.  Taking the corner is the other commonly seen
response. (see variation)];W[df]
(;B[fg]C[I would consider playing the "normal" response instead.  See
variation.];W[kc];B[mc];W[ke];B[ib];W[ic];B[hb];W[jb];B[gc]
;W[qj]LB[of:C][lb:B][qb:A]C[White missed an opportunity here -- he wants to take profit but
the best way to profit is by threatening black's group.  Here
almost anything is better than what he played.  A, B, and C are
moves I would be thinking about if I were white.];B[pg];W[pf]

see variation];W[pe];B[qg];W[oe];B[oh];W[nf];B[ph]C[At this point black didnt look very good here both forces 
divided and very weak 
Was there something else black could have done?

Yes black went for too much and could have done better.  See
variation at move 27.];W[qm];B[qc];W[pd];B[nd];W[qd];B[ng];W[mf]
;B[mg];W[lf];B[oj]LB[rb:A]C[I would be thinking about saving my stones with A instead.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[qi];B[om]TR[qc][pc][od][nd][mc]C[The cap on black looks very bad for white 
what do you think?

Black should be able to get a nice wall but it is hard to kill
white outright.  If white can live in sente he can then aim at
killing the marked stones that you never bothered to fix.];W[ro]
;B[rp];W[qo];B[po];W[pn];B[on];W[oo];B[pp];W[no]C[Oops!  A HUGE mistake for white.]

(;B[mq]LB[mp:A]TR[oo]C[After i made this move i was thinking maybe i 
should have gone A instead
Would that be better?

White should never have tried to run after cutting.  He is not
yet safe.  You need to keep attaking the right side.  See variation.]
;W[pm];B[ol];W[lp]C[
Black extending to P8 may create some possibilities for killing
the white group (s7 looks like a possible nasty placement for
black, for example)

White therefore may need to take an extra move to fix his stones.]

instead?

Your actual move was not bad.  However, I like a move such as
C.];W[kq];B[np];W[mo];B[iq];W[ip];B[hp]C[This push up was correct? or can white 
do somthing ?

A strange move :)];B[kr]C[I think after this move i was ahead

Probably but white may still be able to cause some problems at
the top right corner.];W[cl];B[cj];W[dc];B[cg];W[cf];B[bg];W[bf]

;B[kh];W[nh];B[of];W[ne]C[White should have fought this ko.  It was big and he has some
threats.  If he wins the ko and captures your three stones the
entire right side is in trouble for black.

This was way too timid of white here.];B[og];W[kj];B[jj];W[lj]
;B[li];W[mj];B[kk];W[pl];B[gj]C[After this move there was a big fight

White had a few chances to do better than he did -- I'll show
you when we get to them.  Although I am not sure it would be
enough
because he is behind now.];W[ej];B[dk];W[fk];B[gk];W[fl];B[em]

As you will see this is a bad move.  I think you need to first
play E18.]

cut off so I 
played A
Would B been ok ? or is there something better?

As I mentioned before, white should have played the tesuji at
G4 and I think he would be much better off.  Your play was fine
here -- if you are up by 40 points just make the safe play.]

Congratulations on your win.  You like to fight and you are pretty
good at it.  When you play against stronger players you will
need to take more care in  making sure your stones are safe before
launching an attack.

If you play on IGS looks for me (sergeant).  I would enjoy the
chance to play a game with you.])
