C[Dear reviewer:
I'm playing black in this game and my strength is about 16 kyu.
I put some commentaries. Tell me which is your feel about these.
Thank's for you review.];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dd];B[po];W[eq]

Actually, your question appears to me as a minor technical question and I don't know the answer :))   But the answer to your opponents move is locally at a.

But still... I would ignore both 'a' and the move you did.. Cause there are two weak groups on the board. I would strengthen them.
b or c...];W[mq]C[and should not let W play this move :))];B[hn]
;W[rd];B[qc]C[W has played here and there and you have followed him....

No!

You should check the board and find the most valuable move. Playing around a stone your opponent has just played does not make sense...

Your bottom 3 three stones are in great danger. They have no eye space if W attacks.

Your single stone on the left has the eye space, but it is weak...]

(;W[bm]LB[dm:a][bg:b][cg:c]C[as an answer to this, I would consider 'a', 'b' or 'c'.

W cuts but the cut is not so successful because B strong facing the center...

B could change the result of the game...

---

both of your groups now have eye space :)

W can come up with stronger resistance to connecting. For example I would... Because it is critical

2 things:
If W cuts: You will have 2 isolated groups both having trouble to live...

If B connects: W loses the chance of cut and look at the board now. B looks quite strong towards center. W would not want that!

This cut for W was not so successfull I think. Because both of the Black groups are alive and W group in center has some trouble living :(]

The thing you have to keep in mind is not to be cut.
