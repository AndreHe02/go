C[thank you for reviewing our game.  we are aspiring to improve our game, so we take reviews seriously as an opportunity to learn.

comments and questions are written preceded with who wrote them.

and if you see something that needs noting that we didn't comment on or question, PLEASE let us know what we missed.

XCMeijin - Hi, my name is Mark, XCMeijin on KGS. Hope you find my review to be helpful.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dq];W[pd]C[bkarfunk - can you recomend a better response to d-3 than q-16. this response seems passive in a board-wide view.

XCMeijin - There really isn't a problem opening like this, because black will have to defend the lower left later anyway. Failing that, white can approach. It's important to take the corner points first.]

(;B[jq]C[zetharx - early on with nothing in the center, is this better one the 3 or 4 line?

XCMeijin - I think this is too early, black would be wiser to protect his corner first. See variation.]
;W[do];B[gp];W[dl]C[XCMeijin - This variation, black is low and confined to one side.]
;B[ch];W[cf];B[ck];W[cl];B[bk];W[cp];B[cq];W[qn];B[mp];W[qq]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[po];B[oo];W[fq];B[fp]C[zetharx - do you see that G3 would have been clearly better?

You need to commit to your decision. Attaching to white on top means you want to have influence on the centre. See variation. at move 29]
;W[hq]
(;B[gq];W[hp];B[eq];W[ho];B[jc]C[XCMeijin - I would advise for you to play on the 4th line, much more possibilities]
;W[mc];B[gc];W[eb];B[ec];W[dc];B[fb];W[db];B[qj];W[qg];B[rl]
;W[rm];B[qm];W[rn];B[pm];W[ri];B[rj];W[qc]C[XCMeijin - Big point. Could have considered a tenuki earlier to play here.]
;B[qi];W[rh];B[pn];W[qo];B[lb];W[hr];B[jr]C[zetharx - i looked hard at what i should do.  i chose to let F3 run to connect instead of letting him into my bottom territory.  do you see a better choice?

XCMeijin - you chose right, although you could have probably prevented this earlier. M18 seems small in comparison.]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[gs];B[er];W[fs];B[es];W[hs];B[ep];W[bp];B[bq]
;W[bl];B[fn];W[jo];B[kp];W[hm]
(;B[in]C[zetharx - aggressive stone.  i assumed i would be able to run it to life and cut into any moyo he was trying to create.  do you see a better approach?

XCMeijin - It is often better to chase from the other side, rather than playing close and forcing white to become bigger and stronger. See variation.

For white, he should take advantage of this close approach and run accordingly. See other variation at move 76]
;W[hn];B[jm]
(;W[fl];B[io];W[fm];B[oa];W[pb];B[ob];W[oc];B[mb];W[ef];B[ei]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[op]C[bkarfunk - this attack was unsuccesful, but i feel there was aji to be exploited.

XCMeijin - Approach at O7 seems the best reduction i can see, taking into account the P6 cutting point.]
;B[no];W[ml];B[lm];W[im];B[jn];W[jl];B[kl];W[mj];B[jk];W[il]
;B[ng]C[zetharx - i try to place a stone that he can run in different directions, but eventually i assume i can connect it to a living group.  is this a good approach?  is there a better place on the board?

XCMeijin - White's stones at N10 are floating without support so it is a good idea to attack. I suggest N12, to chase white around.]
;W[oh];B[nf];W[ni];B[lf]C[zetharx - often double digit kyu players do not understand how to run groups to life.  do you see any mistakes in the way i run groups?

XCMeijin - I'm not sure i understand your question, but i am assuming you are refering to groups that can stretch across the board and find life. The key, i think, is to play lightly, in the manner of sabaki. Think of it like this; you are spreading your steones so lightly that they are connected, but even if they are cut off, it is a small loss.]

;W[rg];B[nm];W[kk];B[jj];W[ll];B[km];W[mm];B[ln];W[kj];B[ji]
;W[oj]C[bkarfunk-i feel like this group should not have lived; do you have input on this?

XCMeijin - I believe you should've attacked this group earlier to make things easier, if you were aiming to kill.]
;B[lc];W[md];B[ge]C[zetharx - see a better extention move?

XCMeijin - It might look obvious, but G14 looks good.];W[en]
;B[fo];W[cr]C[bkarfunk - this attack was unsuccessful. Would this have changed with outside liberties filled? How about different placement in the eye space?

XCMeijin - you have 8 points in a corner, i believe that is a good enough requisite to maintain life. At least, you would have lived in seki.
