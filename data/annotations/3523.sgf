C[I'm playing white here. Please help me to improve my play. All comments are welcome. Thank you for your time and attention.

Jay: Glad to help.  This is an interesting game.  Both sides made mistakes, and in the end it turns out to be extremely close.  Unfortunately you made the last crucial mistake, and lost the game.  You  were behind early on, due to judgement of the whole board situation.  Then, caught on somewhat as the game progressed.  It is very interesting to analyze the game.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[do];W[qp];B[oq];W[cd]C[Jay: Interesting openning for W.]

;B[cq]C[krv: This move I can't find in joseki book. Is it bad? How to answer?

Jay: B this play punishes W's mistake.];W[cr];B[dp];W[dr];B[bq]

(;W[iq]C[Jay: The result is that W's position is too low.];B[fp]
;W[gq]C[Jay: W's contuation of low position is not good.  W is overly concentrated.]
;B[lq]C[Jay: Now B is in good flow of the game.];W[po]C[krv: Is this move ok?

Jay: This is fine.];B[qr]
(;W[qk]C[krv: Is this move good? And how about S3 and M5?

Jay: This is an ok move,  you can play at R9 according to joseki.  S3 would be too slow and M5 would not do anything useful.]
;B[qm]
(;W[pm]C[Jay: Q8 may be a better move.  B's invasion is too aggressive, but this move is overreacting, giving B chance to gain something.]

(;W[op]C[Jay: This move is a bit problematic, it results in gote.]
;B[np];W[nn]C[Jay: This move is bad.];B[pp];W[mn];B[qo]C[Jay: These two moves are bad exchange to give up the corner completely.  Your small gain in the center (incomplete as is) would only worthwhile if there were a strong group of W stones on the opposite side of the board, which is now either empty or with some B stones.  B is too happy with this situation.]
;W[mk]C[krv: Can black O8 escape? Seems like yes, but giving much profit to white.

Jay: B already gained a lot in this is sequence.  Escaping two stones is not worthy.]

(;B[rn]C[Jay: B gainned a lot of profit.];W[jo]C[Jay: This move is not accomplishing anything, it looks like endgame move.]

;B[ec];W[gc];B[ee];W[df];B[cb];W[ci]C[krv: Please help me with c18 e17 e15 shape. How to deal with it? It frequently emerges in my games. If not hard give me some variants.

Jay: In this situation it does not look like B escaping, since W's two stones at G17 and K16 are weakly positioned.  The three B stones at UL corner is part of a fighting to neutralize W's center influence.]
;B[me]
(;W[lg]C[Jay: This move appears too loose, it should be played somewhere on the top to help K16 stones while attack the weak B group at E15.]
;B[gd];W[hd];B[ge]C[Jay: Now B settles easily here.];W[fc];B[fd]
;W[ig];B[de];W[ce]C[Jay: This exchange favors W slightgly, better for B to play just B17.  But, guess B wants to solidify the lead by some simple moves.]
;B[ef];W[dg];B[gg]C[Jay: B made some small moves. Guess B is content. But, B is at risk of losing the lead.]

;B[mg];W[mh];B[ng];W[nh];B[hl];W[jj]C[Jay: With so many moves W only gained some one dozen pts in the center, and captured the two B stones at O8 for not much, hardly enough to make up earlier loses in the LR corner.]

(;B[gi]C[Jay: This is again a slow move for B. Should head straight into W's influence to reduce W's center.  B's UL corner group seems to be able to live by using the cut at H17 or diagnal play at B17, or by attaching as shown.]
;W[gj];B[hh];W[ii];B[fi];W[ak];B[gk]C[Jay: Now B appears to have given away the lead.]

;B[kg];W[lh];B[jf];W[lc]

;W[ie];B[kd]C[krv: when I need to protect k17? Seems like now it's too early.

;W[lg]C[Jay: This develops into some complicated fighting, especially some weakness for W on the left, but W controls the center and is on the attack of the UL B  group. 

In Go one can not be single minded about taking certain area, the advantage usually is gained indirectly.   A  further look at the situation, W is not bad at this point.  The weekness on the left can be taken care of while the center is being played out.]

This way, W is still a bit behind from the earlier loses in LR corner, but it is still a long game.  W can profit by attacking one of the two dragons on the left and ending up gaining enough in the fight, using the thickness in the center as support.  This of course requires high level of playing skill, easier said than done.]
