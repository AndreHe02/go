AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hi,

I think you play very well for your level and got good prospects for improving in the future, though you obviously still have a lot to learn (like every single one of us).

I think it's very difficult to evaluate a high hc-game.
Anyway I felt that you were overly defensive and passive in this game, although I don't know whether that was because your opponent was so much stronger than.
A good way to improve for you is reading practice, loads of reading practice. There is a very nice collection on http://tsumego.tasuki.org/. Have look at it. I think that reading practice is a shortcut to getting stronger, though I'm kinda lazy :).

Wish you all the best and if there are any questions don't hesitate just send me an e-mail or chat with me on KGS (Germoe).]
