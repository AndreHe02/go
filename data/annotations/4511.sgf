C[[DrPep\] This is my second game submitted for review. I was surprised with many of white's moves, playing at all the hoshi points. Since I am a beginner I felt I had to invade to survive (and invasion techniques are very weak for me). How could I have better handled these moves? Any comments will be greatly appreciated. By the way, I also felt he was much stronger than a 22k. What do you think?

[Migeru\] Considering you lost by 4.5 points I don't think you are justified to complain that your opponent is underranked. White's opening moves are natural, and if you are concerned about your opponent taking all the star points you should attack earlier.]
;B[qd]LB[od:1][pi:2]C[DrPep: hello
*ObsPro*: have a nice game

[Migeru\] Playing at the 3-4 point you are committing yourself to play somewhere around 1 and then around 2. If you play on the star point you are not committing to developing in any direction and you can react to white's play more freely. Also, having to overcome komi, I believe it is better for black to aim for more influence. The 3-4 point is slightly more territorial.]
;W[dp]
(;B[pp]C[[Migeru\] This is on the wrong side with respect to R16 (compare the variation with the actual game at move 10)]
;W[dd]LB[fc:C][oc:B][cj:D][qj:A][fq:E]C[[Migeru\] Possible continuations.]

(;B[qj]C[[Migeru\] Nothing wrong with this but, in view of your complaints about the way the game progressed, you might want to consider other alternatives (see the variations)]
;W[dj]
(;B[jq]TR[qq]SQ[qj]C[[Migeru\] There is nothing wrong with this as an opening move, but you have to be aware that a double wing like this is very vulnerable to a 3-3 invasion. Maybe an appoach would be better (see the variations)]
;W[jd]SQ[nc][jj]C[[Migeru\] K10 is "the last big point". If you don't like white taking it, you should yourself. Notice how playing your opening move at the 3-4 point comes back to haunt you: white's K16 seems to require an immediate extension around O17 to make sense of your stone being at R16 instead of Q16, and this allows white to take the center.]

(;B[nc];W[jj]C[[Migeru\] Compare the three variations at move 10.

You have allowed white to take "the last big point", and so stake a claim to more territory than you.You were right in feeling the need to invade soon before white can solidify his lead.]
;B[fq];W[qq]C[[Migeru\] This must have hurt.];B[qp];W[qc]C[[Migeru\] This is foolish, not only because invading under a 2-stone enclosure is not likely to succeed, but also because it gives up R3.]
;B[pc];W[cq]TR[cn]C[[Migeru\] The standard response to F3, if that is how white's move is to be interpreted, would be around C6.]

(;B[ce]TR[fc][cf]SQ[cc]C[[DrPep\] I thought about F17 as well

[Migeru\] Think of contact moves as defensive, not offensive moves. Attack the corner from a distance.

Alternatively, you might want to invade at the 3-3 point. White would build a centre-facing wall making K10 redundant. 

Note how the fact that all of white's stones are on the 4th line makes it easier for you to invade on the 3rd line. For this reason, it is not so good to play all your moves on the star points.]
;W[cc]C[[Migeru\] Extremely terrotorial and passive.];B[ch]
C[[Migeru\] White has allowed you to make a base.];W[cj]C[[Migeru\] White has been very passive and allowed you to build a nice base on the 3rd line.]

(;B[pg]C[[DrPep\] too passive?

[Migeru\] You are strengthening an already strong group instead of taking advantage of white's passivity to make a nice, healthy group on the other side.]

(;W[jc]TR[fc][gd]C[[Migeru\] This is also passive, and overconcentrated. Not being under attack, there is no reason to extend in this way. White is leaving himself vulnerable to an invasion.]
;B[eh]C[[DrPep\] passive again?

[Migeru\] Just right, see the earlier comments.]
(;W[jp]SQ[jo]C[[Migeru\] The proper capping move would be at a distance. This just strengthens black.]

(;B[lp];W[pj]
(;B[pl];W[pd]TR[qc]C[[DrPep\] I am at a loss how to respond, felt like I needed at least one corner to have a chance

[Migeru\] This corner is all yours. You should have no difficulty capturing one of the marked stones.]

;W[qf];B[qg];W[og];B[pi];W[rf];B[re];W[oi];B[oj]C[[DrPep\] hoping he would continue toward center so I can build more territory in lower right

[Migeru\] You've dug yourself into a hole and have few good options. Better to connect at R11.]

[Migeru\] Do you mean white's access? Your 4-stone group is now boxed in with few prospects of making eyes.]
