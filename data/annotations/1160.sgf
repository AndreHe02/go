C[As this turned out to be a handicap game, most of the comments are on Black's
moves. It's generally more difficult to comment on White's moves in such
games.];W[qf];B[dj]LB[jd:A][qj:B]C[I would prefer this to be at A (K16) or B (R10), helping out the Q16 stone a
little, and putting at least some pressure on the white stone. A stone at R10
also ould make it easier for Black to get at good result when White plays O17
or O16.];W[fc];B[fe]TR[hc][id][jc]C[This is an often overlooked move, especially in handicap games. But in this
position, with the lonely black stone at Q16, I would still prefer a more
conventional pincer at any of the marked places.];W[nd];B[oe]
C[This will now become somewhat awkward for Black. Normally there should be a
stone at R10 for instance.];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe]LB[og:A]
C[This loses momentum for Black, and only results in bad shape.
Black should simply play A (P13) instead.];W[re];B[pe];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qn];B[oh]LB[np:A][nq:B][jp:C]C[Black realizes that the upper right corner is in bad shape (see earlier
comment), but it is in fact not that urgent. A move at A, B or C (O4, O3,
or K4) would be better.];W[ic]LB[hd:A][cc:B]C[Normally you see White play A (H16) or B (C17) in this position, but
I can't really point at any particular problem with this move. Maybe
Black can press White into a lower position here (starting with A
for instance), than otherwise.];B[ql]LB[jq:A]C[When playing a pincer, especially a tight one like this, Black should have
a stone around A (K3).];W[np];B[oo];W[fq]LB[qq:A]C[A bit early to leave the two stones in the lower right corner. White A (R3) is
probably better.];B[dn]C[*Now* Black could well have played a pincer, but this is ok too.]

(;W[pm]C[This is a heavy move. These two stones will easily become a burden for White.
A possible alternative is to play A (R10), and force Black to capture R6 at
a small scale.];B[qi];W[nm];B[mo];W[mp];B[no];W[lp];B[kn];W[ln]

moves now...];W[jn];B[hq];W[ok];B[qk];W[mk];B[nl];W[ol];B[nk]

;W[lr];B[hm];W[cl]LB[cf:A][cq:B]C[This is getting increasingly difficult for White, so it's hard to criticize
any move at this point. A (C14) or B (C3) are other possibilities.]
