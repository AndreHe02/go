C[Hi, reviewer , thanks in advance for reviewing my game. There should be a lot of mistake from both player, hope you can point that out. And also in this game i feel i played to passively. thank you]

;B[ce];W[ci]C[is this too early?];B[ch];W[bh];B[bd];W[bc];B[dd]
;W[cc];B[bf]C[black b14 looks like a mistake.  it protects the b16 stone which isn't important since white is alive on top whether ot not white catches the b16 stone.]
;W[di]C[this white d11 looks like it would be better if played at b13.  Why ?  because then white has a position on top of and below the black stones with a possible attack on them.

By playing D11, black is left with B13 which captures the c13 stone so black is much safer, and black then also threatens to take the b12 strone which would make black completely safe.

Always best to make the opponent have unsettled group.];B[ei]
;W[eh]C[
Since white is trying to build something on left side, instead of giving away a stone at e12, how about playing e10 right away which threatens double atari at e12 ?]

;B[po];W[qm]C[i think this is wrong];B[cq];W[dq]C[
I think block from other side, see below.];B[cp];W[do];B[bn]
C[now all the territory white was building is gone.  if blocked from other side it would still be there]
;W[cm]C[
this makes it even more painful.  the point of white's earlier moves around d9 werwe to build strength.  If they require c7 then they didn't efficiently build that strength.  White would like to play h3 instead of c7.  otherwise black is making territory and white isn't.]
;B[bm];W[hq]C[is this too slow?


no, but what if black had played g3 instead of b7 ? you're a little lucky here]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[in]C[
h4 is what we call pushing from behind.  black is making more with j6 than you are with h4.]
;W[ho];B[mo]C[
instead of n5, black could have made alot more with p7];W[nc]
;B[qf];W[jd];B[pb];W[ne]C[is this correct choice?

seems ok sinve if black plays o16 black is both building large center territory and threatening m17 invasion.]
;B[id];W[jc]C[
why answer at k17 instead of j17 ?  the purpose of o15 is to support that resistance.

By answering at k17, what if black plays j17 next ?];B[nb];W[oc]
C[this doesn't seem so big, this p17.  what abotu s9 instead ?

compare with if black plays s8 or r9 ?];B[ob]C[
i still like black s8 instead of p18];W[mc]C[
there are many bigger plays than n17];B[hc]C[of course he can just cut me through and i will be way behind]
;W[hb]C[
instead of this h18 how about g16 which threatens j15 ?];B[fc]
C[
black is letting white off the hook.  instead of f17, if black played g16, black is making big territory.]
;W[fb];B[gd];W[gb];B[ec];W[eb]C[
black made big territory white made small one];B[of];W[rf]C[i think this plan is too risky]
;B[re];W[rg];B[qe];W[rj];B[qi]C[
black too easy on white.  what if black attacked with s9 instead of r11 ?]
;W[ri]C[maybe instead of s11, play r10];B[ql];W[rl]C[
white is lucky];B[qo];W[ro];B[pm]C[i think he can just hane at s9 and cause me alot of trouble]
;W[qk];B[pl];W[rn]C[
white falls behind by continually making safety plays.    if white had played r10, maybe this wouldn't be needed.  Try to get sente when possible !]
;B[hl]C[
instead of h8, what about c8 for black ?

compsre with b8 for white, after which black can't cut at c8 .]
;W[fj];B[bg]C[black play too slow here, allow me to reduce the influence ,if not the game is particulary over

yes, black could have played g10 instead of b13, or c8 .
