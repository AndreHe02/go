C[Reviewed by NM.];B[pp];W[pc];B[dd];W[dp];B[pe];W[nd];B[qd]
C[NM: R17 better.];W[kd]C[NM: I would play R17 here, which is more or less sente (otherwise a move somwhere round Q13 becomes very nasty.]
;B[cj]C[Big, but again I would play R17 in a sort of reverse sente]
;W[np];B[pn]C[NM: Good];W[oq]C[NM: again Q3 would be better]
;B[pq]C[NM: more or less sente];W[kp]C[NM; B can play N3 later]
;B[qi]C[NM;: good, reinforces both sides.];W[gq];B[cn];W[gc]
C[NM: I think I would play F17, which is harder on the hoshi stone - bearing in mind there's still R17 if W tries to invade.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[bq]C[NM: Big, but probably not the biggest point on the board. I would prefer F6, R17, K4, or E17]
;W[cd]C[NM: I don't like this. G4 isn't near enough to give effective support. The simple answers C17 or D17 are quite effective. I would play here either C14 or C5 followed by D6. Or even R17.]
;B[ce];W[cc]
(;B[df]C[I prefer D17. See variation for one sequence.];W[dc]
;B[qc]C[NM: Big but a little passive];W[dn]C[NM: Good];B[cm]
;W[pl]C[NM: possible, but I would play R9, which threatens the R11 stone. If W answers Q10 (probably his best play), this stone is poorly placed.]
;B[ql];W[qk]C[NM: So W gets R9 after all.];B[qm];W[pk]C[NM: very solid, but I'm tempted by R10 to keep sente.]
;B[cr];W[dr];B[cp];W[dq];B[br]C[NM: Surely not the biggest play on the board? What about O6, P11, J3 or K4, J17, E16 (pretty well sente, followed perhaps by G15 or H15), N16, or D7? Any of these would be bigger.]
;W[nm]C[NM: a bit thin, but big. Still leaves B P7, then  O6. I would play R13 here.]
;B[ic]C[NM: Good. My only question would be whether B should play P11 first,]
;W[id]
(;B[mc]C[NM: Interesting. The more conventional K16 would also work well, because B wins the ladder. The problem with this play is it can lead to B taking low territory, while W has a high moyo. See variation.]
;W[md]C[Sup: I'm sure I messed up the the defense of this invasion. NM: It came out quite well for W in the end.]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[lb];W[ld]
(;B[nc]C[NM: I don't like this: it leaves W too easy an answer at N18. I would play N18 or K18. See variations.]
;W[od]C[NM: W should cut, preferably at N18]
(;B[ob];W[jc];B[jb];W[kb];B[ka]
(;W[ib]C[NM: I would cut at M18 - see variation.];B[kc];W[hc]
;B[pb]C[NM: I don't think B got full value from his invasion, particularly since the weakness at R13 remains.]
;W[dm]C[NM: bigger than it looks, but still I would prefer R13, P13, or C13.]
;B[dl]C[NM: Does B have to answer? I think I would play K4 or J3.]
;W[fm];B[fk]C[NM: A big move in itself, but it provokes an even bigger answer by W.]
;W[hl]C[NM: Huge!]
(;B[iq]C[Sup: This is probably way too deep, right? I would have played something more around L8. 

NM: I don't think L8 is enough to win. I think I would play L6, and if W tried to surround me I would play L3. The fight gets pretty complex though.  See variation for some examples. Another possibility would be to start with M6.  Or indeed P7/O6. See more variations.]
;W[kr]C[NM: defensive, but very sound. protects N3 as well.]
;B[io]C[NM: Hopeless. I would jump to K5, but I wouldn't even be sure that will survive.]
;W[kl]C[NM: Good.];B[il]C[NM: a nice effort to save what he can, but I think it is not enough to win.]
;W[im];B[hm];W[jm];B[gl]
(;W[gm]C[NM: Bad. If B replies H6, things get nasty. Much sounder to play H6.]
(;B[hk];W[hn];B[ge]C[NM: Very big, but is it enough?  B has 23 in TR, 20 in BR, 52 on L. W has 20 in TL, 57 at bottom., sente, and better prospects for more.]
;W[ig]C[NM: A reducing move, nearly sente. But if B plays P11, the game is still close, i think.]
(;B[hh];W[hg];B[gg];W[gf];B[ff];W[hf];B[fh];W[qg]C[NM: at last!]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[qf];W[og];B[pf];W[pi]C[NM; terrible! Should be R12 (which also stops any attack on Q9).]
;B[kj]
(;W[jj]C[NM: Doesn't seem much point in cutting unless you can stir up trouble somewhere, and I don't see how to do that. How about J12?]
;B[jk];W[kk];B[ji];W[lj];B[ij]C[Sup: Maybe L11 here instead could have reduced much more.

NM: That would indeed be better.];W[kh];B[qh]C[NM: Good];W[qj]
;B[rg];W[of];B[pr];W[or];B[be];W[bd];B[ds];W[es];B[cs];W[er]
(;B[op]C[NM: Surely O6 is bigger? See variation.];W[nq];B[no]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[mn];B[he];W[ie];B[om];W[ol]C[NM: B has finished with a similar position to the variation, but has played P4 rather than P1 and Q1, thereby losing some 6 points. W is now about 6 points ahead.]

(;B[ih]C[NM: Small. L18 is bigger. Or B can try and stir up real trouble with M11. See variation for one possibility.]

;W[ia];B[mb]C[NM: B must fight the ko! He will still find it difficult to win, but without he's 12 points behind.]
