AB[pd][dp][pp]C[ Hi. Firstly thank you for spending your time on reviewing my game. My general trouble in games with handicap is, i guess, ignorance of how to use properly high stones. In normal game usually i'm going for territory from the very beginnng and use low (3rd line) stones as a basis. That is the main issue, but of course all your commentaries and advices are welcom.

MM: Hi Nikita, I am Mike Malveaux, AGA 4 kyu, "hilltopgo" on KGS and IGS.  I will try to comment with handicap stones in mind.  From White's point of view, Black has a big head start, and White has two basic options.  White can either play cautiously and wait for Black to make some mistakes, or White can play aggressively and try to start some confusing fights.  Black usually will try to play safely, to preseve the advantage of the handicap stones, and I think that's generally smart because White probably knows more tricky moves for fighting.]
;W[dd];B[gc];W[jc];B[mc]TR[db]C[MM:  When White played the pincer, White was inviting you to a big sprawling fight.  Black should build strong positions before fighting.  This N17 stone helps your northeast corner, but that corner is already stable.  I think that, instead, you should support the G17 stone you have just played.  I'm not sure what is best, but I like D18.]
;W[fc]LB[gc:A][jc:B]C[MM:  This looks like a tactical mistake by White.  In general, in contact fights, both sides will get stronger in the local area.  So fighting like this will help White in the northwest corner, but because the Black G17 (A) stone will get stronger, White's K17 (B) may be threatened.]
(;B[fd]LB[gc:B][gd:A]C[now i think that it was an overplay, but neverteless what way out from this situation would be best?

MM:  That's a good question.  The answer depends on a couple different things.  1) What is your large-scale goal for this fight?  And , 2) Do you see a way to get to that goal?  Which is another way of saying, are you strong enough to fight this way?  For example, this F16 is a perfectly good way to fight if your goal is to get center-facing strength, and maybe a possible attack on the northwest corner.  Just realize that if White cuts at A (G16), you may have to sacrifice B (the G17 stone) to achieve that goal.  So maybe it is best to prevent the cut by playing at A yourself.  In fact, I think that is what I would do, if I were Black (see var.).]
;W[gd]C[MM:  Of course, since White wants to fight, White makes the crosscut.]
;B[ge]C[MM:  This looks backwards to me.  Why do you want to push White toward a friendly stone?  Normally you will try to put your own stones close to an edge or a corner, where you can more easily make two eyes.]
;W[hd];B[fe]LB[ec:A]C[MM:  Okay, so here is a problem:  You need more practice in fighting to kill the opponent's stones, and fighting to save your own.  If White now plays A (E17), then White will have made a huge gain, and you will have gotten nothing in exchange except three stones with no eyes, too close to White's strong stones, facing the center where they cannot easily make much territory.  Instead, you should play atari yourself at A.]
(;W[hc]C[MM:  Another tactical mistake by White.  For reference, check the variation.]
(;B[iq]C[MM:  WHAT?  You leave the fight so unsettled?  It is good to play in the empty parts of the board, but you've already invested 4 stones up there, and you have a chance to make a huge gain by playing E17 (see var.).]
;W[cn];B[bp];W[en];B[fp]C[MM:  Nice Black sequence, supports the D4 handicap stone.]
;W[dj]TR[qf][qj][qm]SQ[ec]C[MM:  This is the right idea by White.  Now Black should either leave the northwest corner alone for now and claim a big point near R14, R10, or R7 (triangles), or Black should attack the northwest, aiming to isolate the corner from other White stones, starting with the atari at E17 (square).]
;B[dl]TR[fd][fe][ge]C[MM:  That is a nice shape point, but any fighting here is going to hurt your F15 stones (triangles).]
;W[cl];B[dm];W[dn]
(;B[fl]C[MM:  Wrong direction, I think.  Go toward the side, not the center.  Cut the White stones apart.  See variation.]
;W[cm];B[mq]TR[fd][fe][ge][dl][fl][dm]SQ[gi]C[MM:  This is a dangerous tenuki.  You have two groups floating in the center with no eyes.  It is good to get big points on the side, but it is bad to throw away so many stones.  This is like giving White a handicap.  How do you feel if White next plays something like G11 (square -- see var.)?
Okay, so one problem is you push White in the direction favorable to White, probably because you need more practice fighting.  And another problem is you walk away from the fighting too soon, while things are still unsettled, before you get enough profit from the fight.  This O3 is a big point, but not as big as saving your 6 triangled stones.  And I guess that you might worry too much about getting the most value from your handicap stones.  Instead, try to get the most value from the stone you are playing *now*.]
(;W[qn];B[rp];W[on];B[qg]LB[qf:A]C[MM:  Very good!  Might be better one line closer, at A (R14).]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[MM:  I'm never sure which is the right direction to block a 3-3 invasion.  I think this is good, but a stronger player might laugh at me.]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[re];B[qe]LB[qf:A]TR[qg]C[MM:  The fact that you need this move makes me think that the triangled stone (R13) might have been better one line closer to the handicap stone, at A (R14).]
;W[rf];B[qd]C[MM:  I don't like this move.  You force White to do what White wants to do (connect).  You know that White will make the connection if you force her to, so this is not a move that gains you an important advantage -- just one or two points.  If you leave it unresolved until later, you may be able to get more leverage from this move, perhaps in a ko fight for example, or you may even find a way to reduce the corner.]
;W[rd];B[rg];W[qj]C[MM:  Good move by White, claiming the area in front of Black's wall.  Fortunately, it's a very open group of three stones, and Black should be able to profit by attacking it.

Now is a good time to estimate territories.  Black has about 55 in the south, maybe 10 in the northeast, and probably 6 dead stones -- or at least 6 stones that are going to have to work hard to live -- in the northwest and central west.  White has 7 or 8 in the northeast, maybe 7 or 8 in the southeast (after Black reduces it somewhat), and possibly as much as 60 in the west and northwest.  In other words, right now the game looks like White has a small advantage.  We also know where to play to have the most impact -- the west and northwest.]
(;B[pl]C[MM:  Good shape point; good attack.  Did you also consider S8 (var.)?]
;W[ql]
(;B[nl]C[MM:  Running to the center, instead of running toward the sides or toward your friendly stones.  See variation.]
;W[pm]C[MM:  Of course.  If it was a good move for Black, then it's also a great move for White.]
;B[ce]TR[ec]C[MM:  I still think it's good to play the atari at E17 instead.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ed];B[ee];W[cg];B[ec]C[MM:  Well, not now; White has become too strong in the corner.  But this does cause an interesting White shape problem that Black can use for leverage.]
;W[gb]
(;B[dc]C[MM:  Since these stones are going to die anyway, instead let's try a sacrifice to get some leverage for eye space (var.).]

[fi:F][dl:A][fl:A][nl:B][pl:B][dm:A][mn:E]TR[qg][rg]SQ[oi]C[now it's the time when i feel completely confused - i don't have any territory to secure, any weak W groups to haunt and do not have any ideas how to play in the center

MM:  Yes, the mistakes you made many moves ago have left you in bad shape.  White has no weak groups; Black has two weak groups A and B (stones near D8 and Q8).  The D15 group (marked C) is probably alive, but has no prospects to make big territory easily.  Still, a rough count of the board tells me that Black is now slightly ahead, if Black can save the D15 group (C) and one of the other weak groups.  Black pulled ahead because the fighting in the West cut up some of what could have been White's territory.

So, how to proceed?  I like these moves I marked:  P12 (D), N6 (E), and F11 (F).  These are moves that expand from a strong group toward a weak group, moves that help a weak group reach its friends without introducing new bad shape.  I actually would like P11 (square) better than D, except that it makes a weak shape with the R13 stones (triangles).]
;B[mn]C[MM:  Good!  This is the move E I suggested.];W[kq]C[MM:  This is an overplay.  If Black plays normal, calm moves, this stone should die, and in the process help Black secure a huge south territory.]
;B[kr]TR[jo]C[MM:  When the enemy comes into the center of your strength, it's usually best to attack from a distance, not with close contact.  A contact play like this risks giving White leverage.  Instead, something like K5 (tri.) would be safer.]
;W[lq];B[lr];W[mp];B[nq];W[mo]
(;B[jq]TR[nl][pl][mn]C[MM:  Wrong direction.  White is trying to cut off the triangled stones -- the O8 group -- from the friendly Blacks in the south.  So, Black should instead cut off the Whites -- see variation.]
;W[ko]TR[on][no][oo]C[MM:  White takes the nice shape point, but probably White should instead connect to her friends at P6 (tri.).]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[no]C[MM:  Good!  A bit late, but Black got to make the cut after all.]

;W[fn];B[hn];W[hm]
(;B[in]C[MM:  I think this should be at J7 instead.  Even if the White stones escape, Black will profit by punishing the weak White shape.  (var.)]
;W[im];B[gl];W[kk];B[kl];W[jl]
(;B[gi]C[MM:  It was a good fight until now... it is crucial to make the cut at K9 (var.)]
;W[mj]TR[kl][ll][nl][pl][ln][mn]C[MM:  This is a good move by White, attacking from a distance.  The 6 black stones are in big trouble.]

SQ[gi][fl][gl][fm]C[MM:  Also consider the bamboo joint at J10.  Here it seems to make better shape with the stones around F8 and G10.]

C[MM:  Good!];W[sc];B[gg]TR[hh]SQ[hg]C[MM:  This shape has a weakness at H12 (triangle).  Therefore, I like H13 (square) better.]
;W[if];B[hk];W[ek];B[kb]TR[fh]C[MM:  Good -- as long as you see where your two eyes will come from in the central west, in case White attacks near F12 (tri.) for example.]

MM:  My main advice is to do a few life and death problems each day.  I think it's okay to spend a few seconds on a problem, then if you don't get it right away, look at the answer, and figure out why the answer works.

My second piece of advice is about fighting.  In general, you would like to cut the opponent.  Sometimes it is not possible, and you have to run to the center.  But in general, first see if you can run to the side or to some friendly stones, and cut off some enemy stones.  

Also I suggest that you not leave a fight before it is settled.  Unless you are losing the fight -- in that case, leave it early, and come back to it later.

I hope this review has been helpful for you, and you enjoy playing more Go for many years!
