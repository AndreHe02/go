C[ The main things to comment are: 
1) How should Black have dealt with his top right corner? His bottom center group?
2) How should White fight on the top left corner? How to better invade the open spaces on the right and in the center?
3) Important moves? 
4) Direction of  play? 
5) Local fights?

This review may be a little different looking tahn the normal review. I focused on the 5 questions you asked, picking appropriate points of the game and focusing on them. When it says variation, look underneath at the threads underneath.

Questions 1 and 2 I answered directly
Questions 3, 4 and 5 I answered in the context of the first two questions.]

[lq]CR[pf]LB[nd:A][qf:B][ph:D][qh:E][pj:C][qj:F]C[Question 1A:

Black's top right corner has two stages, the original approach and the 3-3 invasion.

We will look at the two stages separately. Black has just played the marked move.

This one space high approach is used for building a moyo on the right side. White has several responses possible. Interestingly enough, this is also a ladder breaker for the F4 cut.

The main plans for White are :
getting influence on the top. [A\]
getting immediate territory on the right and in the corner [B\]
pincering the Black stone. [C-F\]

I personally think that A is White's best plan, given the importance he has attached to getting influence on the top (given his 5th line play).]

[pc:A]C[This is the local situation when Black invades later in. This is a tough invasion to pull off when White has so many stones outside. 

A is usual move. Black can get ko.
B is the strongest move if White has enough outside influence, but you have to be sure it works.]

[js:12][ks:13]C[Question 1B: The bottom center group.


1: So we have seen that Black has taken a local disadvantage in the top right in order to cut here. This is the beginning of the group's trouble on the bottom. 

2: A good move
3: also good
4: this is a little bit slack. One can consider the simple one point jump to e7 as fine. it gets White close to the center. he can no attach at C6 or H6 [variation\]
5: equally slow.
6: forcing and defending.
It might be best for Black to just jump out towards the center instead of playing 7.
8: should be at 19, continuing to pressure Black.
9-18 is all small endgame. The two weak groups should be the main focus of interest.
19: now Black gets this, tipping the balance in his favor with the free move.
21: Time to attack White. He now has two liabilities, getting sealed in on bottom and getting attacked in the middle. Maybe M6 is a good place for 21 as well. D7 is also big, because White has the attachment at C6 to aim at for shape or wrecking the corner otherwise. [varaiation\]]

[dm:5][gm:9][im:10][cn:4][dn:3][mo:A]C[Black tries to make shape here, but he is still only about as strong as Black, While Black has profitted on the left a lot. White 7 at 8 looks powerful, but does not make a huge difference. [variation\]

Black 14, a tenuki, seems out of place since his middle group is so weak, and White has some eye shape?

14 at n5 looks interesting.]

[nr][rr][rs]CR[gc]LB[ic:A][jc:B][hd:C]C[Question 2-A:  How should White fight in the top-right corner.

Black double approaches, and White wants to counter attack. the stone on the left side is not really a target, so he should dedicate his effort to attacking the top right side, possibily making territory., or building enough influence to threaten the P9 cut.

A is the severest conventional attack, but it can get counter attacked more easily.
B is a tad less severe, but more likely to make top territory.

Black has an excellent shape move at g15 though, so a sustained attack is difficult. White ends up getting attacked instead.

Pressing at C builds influence, and the question becomes can White use this influence at all?]

TR[dd][fe]C[This is a complex fight up to this point.

1: finally Black gets to the top side. This is a problem with White's original two stone formation, it has no base and has cutting weakness.

2: discussed, really can only press for influence, because of White's weak shape in the corner.

7: only forces White to connect, while if at 8 would split White. [variation

9: stopping White's connection is good ^_^
10: running is necessary.
11: just helping White get stronger.
14: should be at 19 if White wants to connect.
15: seems weird, but ends up working
21: good reading Black

concerning 23: you played A, but connecting at F14 in sente is very big as well. This allows you to attack the Black stones afterwards. [variation\]]

White has lost the 4 stones, but has gotten a lot of stones on top side for territory. However Black 13 was painful. In exchange White 10 helps build thickness which ended up helping when the h5 stones got attacked.

Question 2-C: Briefly appended

White should have no problem invading the middle. The p9 cut seems tough to refute, and White can easily just jump into Black's middle with B and reduce inside with C]

C[Question 2-B: How to invade the open places in the right.?

Black has played Q10 and suddenly the right side looks very very intimidating. How for White to invade?

A: this is the common approach, but it is tough once Black has stones on both sides. this is your choice

B: This is the usual deep invasion, it gives impressive thickness.

C: this is a more uncommon invasion used when Black has a wide extension on one side and a short one on the other.

D: similar to C

E: similar to C

I have not filled in all the possibilities, but you can experiment with them.]
