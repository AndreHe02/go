C[* Hi Alexander, I'm thirdeye[1k\] on KGS and I'll be revieing your game, all of my comments will have  a * before them 


Hi. Thanks for reviewing my game.

I was playing black here and won by 4.5 points, though i feel that i was behind after fuseki.

My main point of interest is the mistakes i made during beginning and early mid-game (especially ones, that went unnoticed by my opponent).

 I would be very grateful for any suggestion on other parts of the game too.

Thanks in advance,
Alexander.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[cn]C[Here i attempted to go for Kobayashi fuseki, but my oppent have chosen tsuki-nobi, and i think it did work out well for him.]

   I'd prefer L3 but I'm really not sure which is better  


O3, i think, was a mistake.

it gave too much for w on lower left.

was somewhere around L3 better?];W[jq]
