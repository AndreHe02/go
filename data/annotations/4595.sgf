C[gwen974 [16k?\]: hi :)
gwen974 [16k?\]: have a nice game !
pawko [17k\]: hi
pawko [17k\]: the same to you

gwen974 [17k?\]: Hello, I play White here. I am definitely not a 16kyu... rather 18-19 kyu.
gwen974 [17k?\]: Thank you for your comments. I reached a plateau since 1 or 2 months and I think I need my games to be commented to improve a bit :)`

RS: Hi Andrew. I'm Rex and I play mostly on DGS (Dragon Go Server) where I am 8 kyu. When you're playing *always* try to play locally and globally. Usually players between 25k and 10k, have no problem playing locally, but they do not check the whole board so they will push their opponent into one of thier own groups. When you go over this game, try ask yourself what local effect and what global effect each move had.

I noticed about 3 times you left one position to play somewhere else, but the position you left was weak. I'll point those out. On with the game.]
;B[pc];W[cd];B[qp];W[dq]C[gwen974 [17k?\]: I played symetrical... in fact, I prefer josekis resulting from 4-3...

RS: Nothing wrong with that.];B[qe]
(;W[oq]C[RS: The usual thinking is W should play somewhere around k16 to keep B from making an ideal extension from his upper right shimari like he did in a few moves. I enjoy going through  pro games, and around 90% of the time, they will immediately play k16 or k17. See variations.]
;B[pn];W[mp]C[RS: This move *only* seems to gain territory. I say seems because B could play L3 and undercut p3 and n4.

A move can have from 1 to 4 objectives: defend, attack, gain territory, take away territoy. The best moves are those that do all 4. 

Exercise: Go through this game and usually one objective will jump out at you, like here being gaining territory. Choose another of the 3 objectives, and see if you can come up with a move that will satisfy these 2 objectives. Then try to satisfy 3 objectives, then 4. This will be difficult and time consuming, but very rewarding.]
;B[jc]C[RS: And here's the ideal extension I mentioned earlier.]
;W[qj]C[gwen974 [17k?\]: I thought I had to invade here : Black would have been too strong on the right...

RS: You're right there. You still have an uphill battle though.]
;B[ql];W[qg];B[iq]C[gwen974 [17k?\]: I really didn't know what to answer here... I choose to approach from the left...

RS: It doesn't matter from which you approach B will be able to make a 2-space extension, so I would tend to approach from the right so my lower right stones are strong. Let's see what it looks like (variation).]

(;W[gq];B[lq];W[lp]C[gwen974 [17k?\]: I didn't know if I should make a base, run to the center or make thickness...]
;B[mq];W[np];B[ck]C[gwen974 [17k?\]: Is a corner enclosure a good answer to that kind of move ?]
;W[co]C[RS: Wc5 could even be at c6.];B[ch]
(;W[cf]C[RS: This extension is not useful since it does not put B in any kind of danger, and let's B play where you want to play. See variation.]
;B[fc];W[nc]C[gwen974 [17k?\]: I saw that Black had much territory in the top... I had to do someting but I failed :(]
;B[nd]
(;W[md];B[mc];W[ne];B[od]
(;W[ld]C[RS: You need to be brave to start a cross-cut like B  did. See what could happen if W takes the battle to B.]
;B[lc];W[oe]C[gwen974 [17k?\]: I saw that Black is aheah in territory so I build some influence and thickness... but it's quite hard to use it correctly]
;B[pe]
(;W[og]C[RS: I would have the tendancy to push again at L16 (variation).]
;B[lf];W[mf];B[le]
(;W[db]C[gwen974 [17k?\]: If Black had moved here, my 2 stones would be in trouble I think

RS: First instance of leaving a position before you should. You're right it would not be good but I don't think W would have died.]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[eb];W[cb]
(;B[me]C[RS: Bad move for B. See variation.]
(;W[hc]C[RS: Invasion too deep. Here's an interesting technique to see where to invade or reduce. In this instance, draw a line between Bm14 and Bd17. This loosely defines his territory. Playing inside this line is an invasion; outside, is a reduction. You don't *have* to invade; sometimes reducing is good enough and safer.]

C[RS: Opps.];W[fh];B[eg];W[hi];B[ee];W[mg];B[lj]C[gwen974 [17k?\]: I didn't know what to answer to this powerful move...
