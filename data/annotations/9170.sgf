C[H: Hi, my name is Holger and I will be reviewing your game. I will prefix all my comments with H:
I hope my review will be useful.];B[cd];W[pp];B[dq];W[pd]TR[ec]
C[This opening feels really week but having never played white I didn't know how else to cope with being one move behind

H: This opening is fine. You are playing white and you have to accept that black is one move ahead.

If you really want to prevent the enclosure at the top left, you could play E17. But then you should make sure the joseki ends in sente so that you can play around Q16 next.

I personally prefer to play calm and focus on setting up a framework first.]

H: Black P17 is not Joseki and I think your response was OK.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[oe];B[lc]C[H: Black's position in the top right is not very good. You should use the weakness and put black under pressure.]

(;W[pf];B[hc];W[pn];B[oq]C[Again. Should I have been more agressive with a pincer instead?

Try building a framework first. See alternative.])
