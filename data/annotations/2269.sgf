C[X: (All my comments will be prefixed by "X", to distinguish them from yours) Hi!  I'm Alex, and I'll be reviewing your game.  First of all, the reason the upper corner isn't counted for White is that you and your opponent both forgot to remove dead stones at the end of the game.  Computers are stupid; they can't tell what's dead and what's not.  If you leave the opponent's stones lying around in your territory at the end of the game, the server will assume that it's seki, and not count points for either player.  Notice that, at the end of the game, the bottom left is not counted for black, because there are White stones in there.

I don't use KGS, so I can't tell you exactly how removing dead stones works there.  On IGS, using Panda Egg, after the game is over, you just double click any stones that are dead, to remove them from the board.

Anyway, long story short, yeah, you did win.

---

I thought I as white had won the game but in the KGS system i noticed afterwrads that i had lost and 'jn'had won. This surprised me very much. It seems that the upperleft corner is not counted for white as i thought it would have been. Is this correct?]
;B[oc]C[X: I know I should be reviewing for the White side, but I'd just like to comment that the 3-5 point is a very specialized opening, and beginners should probably stick to 3-3, 3-4 and 4-4 (maybe 4-5, but that's also hard to play).  Even at my level (13k* on IGS), no one opens at 3-5.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er]
(;W[bp]C[X: This is not joseki.  You give Black way more than he should get.  See variation for the standard way to play.]

(;B[bq]C[X: But Black cooperates.  See variations for a couple of ways Black could exploit your mistake.]

(;W[es]C[X: I don't understand this move at all.  Just play F3.]
;B[fq];W[ep];B[fc]C[X: Black should not tenuki at this point.  The E1 stone poses a danger if he doesn't capture it by playing F1.]
;W[fr]C[X: This is good, but your next move is a mistake.];B[dr]

(;W[ds]C[X: This lets Black kill your stones and escape the corner.  Instead, you should play G3 and capture the black stone in a ladder.  Then Black's corner gets a two-stage ko for small life in gote, or dies if Black mistakenly tenukis.  See variations.]
;B[ap];W[ao];B[aq];W[br];B[cs];W[fs];B[gr];W[bs];B[gs];W[cr]
;B[ds];W[fs]C[X: Wasted move, and a free prisoner for Black.  -1 point in gote for White, worse than passing.  Black already has two eyes.  There's nothing you can do here.  Also, if you were going to block at A5, you have to defend that stone at B6.  Otherwise... (see variation)]

(;B[jd];W[fp];B[gq]
(;W[pj]C[X: Aside from still needing to defend at B6, I'd be worried about letting Black play a double kakari at C14.  See variation for a simple joseki that should be useful at your level.]
;B[pg];W[dj]C[X: This would be a good move (or maybe D11), if it weren't for Black being able to destroy your wall with B5.  From the result of the game, though, he obviously doesn't see it either, so this turns out well for you.]
;B[fj]
(;W[fm]C[X: This is the wrong side to attack from.  Don't use a wall to make territory.  Try to squash his stones against the wall.]
;B[gm]
(;W[fl]C[X: This isn't bad, but a hane would be more severe.  Black might crosscut and start a complicated fight.  Since you're behind, though, this is what you want.]
;B[gl];W[fk];B[gk];W[gj]C[X: Good.  You've got to cut.  If you just take territory at E10 and Black defends the cut, the White stone at Q10 looks very lonely.]
;B[hj];W[gi];B[fn];W[fi];B[ej];W[ek];B[ei]C[X: Black shouldn't be resisting.  They say, "If you don't know ladders, don't play Go."  They're right.]
;W[eh];B[di];W[ci];B[dh];W[dg];B[dk]
(;W[cj]C[X: Just capture.  Less aji that way.];B[em];W[ch];B[cn]

(;W[dl]C[X: Good.  The cut at E6 doesn't work.  See variation.]
;B[el];W[en];B[eo];W[dm];B[go];W[fo];B[io];W[gn];B[mo]C[X: White must be very happy with this sequence.  The left side is huge.  Of course, B5 still destroys a lot of territory in sente, but Black still hasn't noticed it.]
;W[gp];B[hp];W[ho];B[iq];W[go]C[X: Totally unnecessary.  H5 wasn't in atari.  Even if it was (Black H6), it still wouldn't be worth connecting.]
;B[hn];W[in];B[im];W[hm]C[X: Black is playing terribly here, giving you way too much.  It's easy to see why you won.]
;B[jp];W[hk];B[jn];W[hl]C[X: Unnecessary.  Those stones couldn't escape anyway.]
;B[jm]
(;W[hn]C[X: Waste of a move.  It's just a half-point ko, not worth playing until the very end of the endgame.  See variation.]
;B[il];W[ik];B[jk];W[ij];B[jj];W[ii];B[ji];W[ih];B[jg]C[X: Now, you're taking a lot of territory, but you're giving Black a heck of a lot of strength on the right side of the board.  Your Q 10 stone is the only thing saving you from a massive defeat now.  You'd better be awfully sure that it's going to live.  If Black R8 now, you're going to have to fight strongly.  Of course, both of Black's corners are still open to invasion, at R3 or something like R16 (actually, I'm not quite sure the best way to invade under a 5-3 stone, because, as I said, no one at my level plays it... R16 looks good to me, though).]
;W[jh];B[kh];W[bo]C[X: YES!  You finally saw it.  You're lucky Black didn't see it first, although it's not as damaging now than it would have been back at the beginning of the game.]
;B[if]C[X: Way too slow for Black.  He should be attacking the Q10 stone in the most severe way possible.]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[hf]C[X: Again, Q10 is the critical stone.  Both of you are ignoring the most important area of the board.]
;B[he];W[ff];B[ge];W[gf];B[ie];W[fe];B[gd];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb]
;B[gc];W[fa]C[X: Useless endgame move.];B[ga];W[ec]
(;B[lg]C[X: That cut isn't very dangerous.  See variation.]

(;W[pl]C[X: I'm glad you're finally moving to defend Q10... but something like R7 would make a more secure base.  You could also try R6, inviting the invasion at R8, but that might be too aggressive, given how strong Black is around here.  See variations.]
;B[qk];W[ql];B[ok];W[pk];B[ol];W[qj];B[oj]
(;W[rk]C[X: Not necessary.  Black couldn't get out.  See variation.]
;B[qi]C[X: I don't understand this move.];W[ri];B[rh]
(;W[si]C[X: Just kill him.  See variation.];B[qh];W[sh];B[sg]
;W[rg]C[X: Learning from your own mistakes, I see.  Too bad Black didn't.  Unfortunately, I think this makes it impossible (or at least much harder) to invade R16, so maybe you should have done that instead.]
;B[rf];W[sf];B[re];W[qg];B[qf];W[pi]
(;B[oh]C[X: Black is doing you so many favors?  Why not just capture at T13 instead of letting you take three stones for free?]

(;B[me]C[X: There's no space for White to make eyes out there, so Black should be focussing on killing, rather than just sealing him in.  White can make double atari anyway, so it doesn't work.]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[lc];B[la];W[ma];B[ka];W[ja]
(;B[ia]C[X: Ordinarily, a throw-in at L19 would kill now. Black's formation is weak, but reading it out, I think it still works.  See variation.]

[ls][ms][ns][os][ps]C[X: Anyway, the reason you "lost" the game is that you forgot to remove the dead stones.  Really, I think you should have won (although I haven't counted, it looks to me as if White is far ahead, since Black let his top group live, when it should have died).

Aside from that, your main weaknesses are:

a) Ignoring the cut on a first-line hane (e.g. B5 at the beginning) which can devastate a formation.  This is such a common thing that you should learn to quickly analyze whether or not protecting it is necessary (sometimes, that first line stone has somewhere to run to, and you don't need to connect).    b) Too much interest in capturing or protecting unimportant stones.  Stones are not all created equal; learn to distinguish between a stone that is just worth a couple of points from a stone that is critical to your formation or your opponent's.   Stone-capturing disease is common among novices.

c) Of course you need to study life and death a bit.  I do too.  There were times when Black could have killed you, and you're lucky he didn't.  Also, you went about trying to kill the bottom left corner the wrong way in the beginning of the game.

d) But most of all, not knowing when to tenuki.  When you and your opponent were pushing each other along the middle of the board in the middle game, the value of those moves was getting smaller and smaller, while the value of starting something on the right side was getting bigger all the time.  If Black had wisely attacked your Q10 stone before you had a chance to build a base for it, the game would have gone much differently.]
