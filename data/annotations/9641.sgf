C[Hello, sensei!
I got to play this nice game and want to see what you can say about it.
I am white.

Best regards,

;W[lc];B[jd]C[Don't really know how to answer, so I played simply.

reid: simple is good :-)

The theme of this game has been set by black playing san-ren-sei with D10.  His strategy will be to make his influence more powerful.  White's focus should be to prevent that.]
;W[nd]LB[le:A]C[reid: Black K16 is a bit odd.

Black might be better off playing K16 instead of exchanging O17 for M17 first.  It would be more in line with his strategic goal of building influence.

White O16 or extending to A (M15) seem like reasonable answers.]
;B[od];W[oe];B[oc];W[md];B[pc];W[qc]C[Is this good?

reid: White is ahead numerically in this corner (K16 isn't doing much for black in this fight), so pressing hard seems like a good idea.]
;B[qd];W[pe];B[rc];W[qb];B[rb];W[qe];B[rd];W[pb];B[ob];W[mc]
;B[pa];W[nb]C[reid: White's last three moves (Q18, N17, and O18) are all forcing moves, but it's too early to play them.  Yes, they keep sente, but by playing them now, you have settled this corner situation completely.

You are at the stage (around 1D) where you understand and appreciate the value of keeping sente.  The next step is to appreciate the value of potential inherent in positions.  Wasting situational potential is called 'aji-keshi' which means 'erasing the aji'.

Best case, that's three lost ko threats.  Worst case: as the game develops, you might prefer to exploit that potential with different forcing moves.

Beware of "it's sente, it must be good".];B[qa]LB[cf:C][mg:A]
[qo:B]C[How to extend here?

reid: Things white should consider:

1. The weakness at O15.  Black can't cut directly, but this will be a constant irritation for white in any fighting.  Black moves in the center area may be sente.

2. Black S16 undercuts the right side, making that area less valuable.

3. White M17 similarly undercuts black's top side and makes that area smaller.

I'd say white's options are:

1. Bite the bullet and re-enforce the O15 weakness immediately (somwhere around A),

2. Take the lower right corner (somewhere around B - this is my preference)

3. Invade around C.];W[qk]C[reid: Because of black S16 the right side is small.  It would be better to play this closer to Q3.]
;B[po]C[reid:  I think this is a mistake for black.  It seems natural, but black still needs to build the influence of his high stones on the other side of the board.  If he starts a new weak group inside white's sphere of influence, white should be able to engineer a situation that destroys that influence while attacking the new weak group.]
;W[np]LB[pp:B][qp:A]C[reid: I think I'd want to play at A (R4) or B (Q4) instead.

White wants Q5 to be weak and running, so taking the eye base (and some corner territory) seems like a good strategy.  Black would struggle for eyes while K4 and R9 would be well placed for the coming fight.]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[rr];B[qm];W[ok];B[om]C[reid: Black is almost alive.]
;W[re]LB[cf:A][rl:B]C[Afterwards I thought it was small move.

reid: Yes. Better to invade at A or continue attacking with B (double-sente!).]
;B[jg]LB[cc:A][cf:B]C[Where to go now?

reid: K13 doesn't quite threaten the O15 cut, so it's not sente.

Black should use his gote closer to the upper left corner (A or B, perhaps).  I have heard moves like K13 (that try to take the center in gote) referred to as 'empty' moves.]
;W[cf]C[reid: Yes, this looks like the right next move :-)]
;B[be];W[fc]LB[dc:B][jc:C][cj:A]C[reid: With this move, white declares; 'I don't care if you kill C14 as long as I can make F17 live.  But as we noted earlier, the upper side is small (white M17), so really, white wants C14 to live and doesn't care much about the upper side (yet).

Instead of F17, I think I'd try a probe with white A (C10) to see how black responds.

Once white can settle a group on the left side or center, he can think about dealing with the top side.  Black needs two moves to secure the corner (something like B) and block the side (like C) so white is not in a hurry.]

C[Here I think white better out.];B[fe];W[id];B[hf];W[if];B[ig]
;W[je];B[jf];W[ke];B[ie];W[hd]C[reid: Hmm, a bunch of black influence just turned into about 25 white points.  Of course, black also got about 30 points of solid territory from it.  I think black should have been more than 5 points up on this exchange however.

The board still looks fairly even though, which means (since this is a no-komi game) that white is a bit behind.]
;B[go];W[hp]C[Small again?

reid: Well, not small, but is it big enough?  That black moyo is suddenly looking pretty scary.  Still, it's hard for white to *not* play H4 (or H3).]
;B[in];W[il];B[hk];W[hl];B[gl];W[gm];B[fm];W[hn];B[gn];W[hm]
;B[ho];W[io];B[jn];W[fl];B[gk];W[fn];B[em];W[fo];B[lq]C[This is trouble. I was short on time, so I played not really good. How is better to answer?

reid:  Yah.  The situation is complicated.

White's shape with H7 is awkward (G5 are captured, but white has only three liberties and the shape is bad).  But both the H7 and the Q3 groups have a pretty solid grip on life, but that Q2 weakness gives black a pinch of hope.

The black stones at Q5 aren't completely safe yet.

And finally, black needs to defend his G11 area (perhaps the cutting stone at F8 could be useful).

Given all that, it's not easy to plot a wise course.  White probably wants to keep as many options open as he can, and hang on to sente.]
;W[lp]C[reid: M4 is a fairly natural move, but contact moves often have a way of helping the contacted stone.]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[mo];W[kq]LB[no:A][nq:B]C[reid:  L3 is also natural, but it might be a problem here.

The K4 stones are completely alive (given the G5 stones are captured).

The Q3 stones are not as clearly alive.  I'd want to use L3 to keep the Q3 stones strong so white can attack the Q5 group.  A (O5) or B (O3) for example.]
;B[nq];W[lr];B[oq];W[nr];B[pr];W[or];B[pp];W[ps]C[reid:  This is a painful result.  Not only is white's territory reduced, but Q5 is now alive.]
;B[mh];W[oh]LB[cq:A]C[reid: Another natural move, but let's examine it more closely:  White can get at most 15 points by defending here.  If he doesn't defend, black can probably reduce that to five points, but he probably can't kill anything given the strength of the Q15 wall.  So P12 is a 10 point gote move.

White A (C3) is worth at least twice that.  The three-three is huge because not only does white take away black points, but he makes some points of his own.

Besides, white cannot afford to defend territory at this point - he will lose by slow attrition.]
;B[rl]C[reid:  When black captured O4 and made the W5 group safe, S8 changed from being double-sente to sente for black, gote for white.]
;W[rk];B[jk];W[ik];B[ij];W[jl];B[kl];W[kk];B[jj];W[ll]C[This I think is the losing move.

reid: Actually, the whole sequence starting with white's J9 response to black K9 should be left unplayed, at least for now.  By not playing, the white J8 stones have three liberties.  Making any move reduces that count.

Better to take C3 and see what develops.

The sequence that follows loses too much for white to make a comeback, even though white gets the C3 point first.


To improve your game, I suggest studying the potential in situations, and noticing when it's best to just let things sit while the board develops.  Try to manage the potentials in different areas so they work together to your advantage.  Avoid aji-keshi. and avoid thinking "it's sente, it must be good".

Good luck, play strong.
