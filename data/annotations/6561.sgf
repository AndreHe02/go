C[BB: Thanks for the review.  I've marked my questions with "BB" like this.

This game shows what seems to happen to me pretty frequently.  I think I'm doing all right, but then gradually my opponent eats into my territory, while I'm not able to eat into his. One of my main concerns is how to play in the opening. I have looked at basic patterns, but I really have no idea how to decide between them (i.e., which corner to approach, how to respond to opponent's approach on my corner).

Hi, I'm Bernd, HonFu here in the ladder and on KGS. I'll try my best! :-)]
;B[pp];W[cd];B[pc];W[dq]C[H.: When deciding about kakari, consider kakari against 3-4, 3-5 and 4-5 points as more urgent than kakari against 3-3 and 4-4. 4-4 is best left alone for a while, because it takes 3 stones to really secure the territory from there, so you're not in a hurry to prevent secure territory there now. 3-3 is already stable, so there's nothing to prevent. Furthermore it has not much influence, so you don't need to hurry erasing development potential. 3-4, 3-5 and 4-5 all threaten a shimari, so it's more urgent to approach them.

Here black has two points to kakari. Kakariing C16 is correct, because that stone extends from Q17. Try to make your stones work together right from the start!]
;B[qi]C[H.: Black plays chinese opening pattern instead (never seen it before with a white stone at c4), so white should prevent a double wing framework. Best would be to play around the upper middle, because the area there is already more stable. Problem: C16 points to the bottom, not to the right. If white doesnt play there, black might kakari that stone next, which would make an even better extension than before, extending from right side influence.]
;W[cn]C[H.: This is congruent with the idea of the urgency of shimari or kakari around 3-4 points, but white looks low on the left, just waiting for black to get advantage in influence.]
;B[ed]C[BB: Is this a good approach?  I still have no real understanding of how to decide what kinds of moves to make in the opening.

H.: Looks very good to me.];W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[gd];W[cg];B[kd]
;W[jp]C[H.: Both players have taken the big points so far, and on first glance it seems even. But in my feeling black is a bit better, because white is so low on the left side.]
;B[jj]C[BB: I was pretty optimistic at this point.  Was I justified in that?  At this stage I had no real plan for what to do next.  I hoped to let my opponent attack me and try to solidify my territory in respond.

H.: Looks like a possible strategy to me, since chinese opening aims for building a moyo.]
;W[qe]C[H.: Now it is important to stick to your strategy. Moyos are not territory, moyos are attacking formations, areas where you want to fight advantageous (and if you can, kill).

So what you don't want to do is making life easy for him. Don't let him just live in the corner! Force him to get a weakish group! If white is put on the run, tengen will become very useful.]

(;B[pe]C[BB: Again, I'm not sure if this response is good or not.  My idea was to build up thickness along the top where I already have some stones sketching out territory.

H.: As soon as this white stone is settled, white can start his next reduction from the outside. Don't make life easy for him. (See variation!)]
;W[qc];B[pd];W[qd];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc];W[rf];B[qg]
C[H.: Of course confining white is good, but ... eventually you will have to rely on turning a lot of this moyo into actual territory to counter white's two shimaris. It's always bad when you have to rely on a large moyo becoming territory completely, because it's not what a moyo is made for (that's why it is called moyo, not territory).

My variation may not look as large as this on first glance, but every weak group the enemy has will give you the initiative for a long time. That's more valuable in this case I think. In other cases it may be the opposite, when the moyo is a bit wider, but L16 and R11 seem to be too close to your wall - overconcentrated!

Plus: Look at your formation, you have just one large area. That is said to be not a good idea, to rely on only one large territory. If it is successfully invaded, then the game is over, because you have no other areas to take profit after your attack. (And this is exactly what is going to happen, right?)

You should try to keep the game flexible. If you settle too fast and too easily, then you may become defensive for the rest of the game, because you get obliged to defend what you invested so many stones in. Also in this way attacking the kakari stone by taking its base seems to be better.]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[qr]
(;B[lp]LB[cj:A][no:B]C[BB: In retrospect this seems pointless.  What should I do instead?  Something like A?  Or just pop out at B?

H.: I like the direction. You press his position flat on the side, while you expand the right side moyo - your chief asset. Problem: The exact position allows white to push through and cut you off.]
;W[pq]C[H.: Pointless now. This is endgame. I think, pushing through your gap was better.]
;B[qp]
(;W[np];B[mn]C[H.: Yes, try to save face!];W[nn]
(;B[gp]LB[cj:A][fq:B]C[BB: I saw it didn't look good for my two stones near M4.  Is this move just stupid?  Should I ignore those two stones and invade at A or some such thing?

H.: You have to follow the strategy which you chose, not abandon it in the middle. You played N6, so now, after his push, you can't just let him walk in further. If this was your plan, it would have been better not to play N6 at all. You can't let the opponent have all good points.

And if you want to play next to an ogeima shimari, B is a good point, because it creates corner invasion potential (starting with C3).

Invading at A is out of the question. Principle: Only invade if absolutely necessary, because invading almost always creates a weak group for you. Imagine white hunting that group out and walking along with it in your precious moyo!

C6 and C13 are low (3rd line), so even if white gets to play something like D10 he will have only about 10 points in this area. Furthermore, you will still be able to hack into it later, if you want to.]

;W[dr];B[gn];W[dn];B[en];W[er];B[fq];W[em];B[fo];W[ep];B[eo]
;W[ho];B[fm];W[el]C[H.: This whole action has helped him to solidify and extend the left side.

So what was your plan putting a group here? You gave white solid territory on the left, so you must get something out of it. If you planned to attack the bottom center, you should follow suit. The group around F5 itself is without value, having no influence, not clearly two eyes yet since white can choose a good moment to play G5, and only 3 points of territory up to now.]

(;B[hn];W[lq]C[H.: Attack over. Now what does your group in the bottom left do except standing there, small, bulky, compressed?]
;B[nm]C[H.: Good, you were able to still get the point, aiming for a large center territory.]
;W[lo];B[no]C[H.: This stone was no danger. Furthermore your move has no effect on white, so he should just tenuki and play a large reduction.]
;W[mo];B[on]C[H.: Good for black, no aji left in this area.]
;W[go]C[H.: Pointless at this moment. Black is not even half confined, escape to tengen at hand.]
;B[gl]C[H.: maybe L7 bigger, or something around the upper left, which you play later. This move should be at least one point higher (play the largest move that still ensures connection).]
;W[km];B[lk];W[jg]LB[hg:A]C[H.: So white comes in, but too deep. He'll have a hard fight, which will most likely lead to his death. A is the typical move now, blocking the escape route and making it tight for white at the same time.]
;B[eg]C[H.: This leaves white leeway. He should try to expand and live now, as quickly as possible, inside your moyo. If he gets reasonably large and survives, you probably lose. So the cap was better I think. Your move of choice would have been good earlier, for moyo building intentions, but now is the time to attack fiercely.]
;W[ei];B[dh]C[H.: I know, a weak point like this cries for being exploited. But don't do it automatically!]

(;W[cj];B[ch];W[df];B[ef]C[H.: This sequences were great for black. Left side broken up, corner confined, and stones safely connected. Oh yes, and K13 is still looking terrified.]
;W[fe];B[ee];W[fd];B[ge];W[hi];B[ih]C[H.: Here of course splitting this shape was very good!]
;W[hh];B[ig];W[ii];B[ji];W[ff];B[gg];W[hg];B[hf];W[hk];B[hl]
;W[ik]C[H.: Good! All important aims accomplished. Upper left safe, bottom left alive, K13 cut off. With a good endgame you should win now.]
;B[im]C[H.: Pointless: you are already alive.];W[qk]C[BB: This is exactly the kind of invasion I never know how to deal with.  Am I wrong in thinking I shoud be able to kill it?  How should evaluate this position?

H.: In cases like this, where the aim is not attacking but killing (you are right: you really should kill this stone!), you should apply the following principles, which I once heard a dan player say as the most natural thing imaginable:

1.) Surround
2.) Limit
3.) Kill

The question: how to actually do this?]
(;B[pj]C[H.: Your move is normal, just walling white in. Even if he lives, he lives small. The problem: I think, you can't allow him to live even small. You need your territory here. (See variation now!)]
;W[qm]C[H.: Surrounded he is nevertheless, and since you are so strong in the area, you should attack his shape, not allowing him eyes (see variation).]

(;B[qn];W[ol]C[H.: He tries to make shape. Still, maybe R8 is good.]

(;B[pl]C[BB: A bad idea?  Should I just play A to close off a big area?

H.: Principle: Don't touch the prey! By touching weak stones, they get stronger. Try to make him heavy instead by peeping, then keep him from getting eyes!]
;W[pk];B[pm];W[oj]C[H.: This is - considering the tight spot that he is in - comfortable shape. Too easy on white!]

(;B[pi]C[H.: Hmm ... solid, but not very efficient (empty triangle).]
;W[mk]C[H.: When a stone touches you it is no good idea to ignore that. Either you hane, or - when the cut is dangerous - you extend.]
;B[nl]
(;W[nk];B[ml];W[lj];B[kk];W[mh]C[H.: Now his shape has become much too good, because you couldn't make him heavy.

Best is to confine enemy stones early, so that even if they live, they live small. But in this game, if you don't kill him, you can't win, so you needed to make him heavy and let him die, like in the earlier variations.]
;B[ni];W[oi]
(;B[oh]C[H.: If you let your stone get cut off, the attempt to erase the eye becomes meaningless. You even help him.]
;W[nh]C[H.: Now white's 50% alive.];B[og];W[jh];B[if];W[ll]
;B[kl];W[lm];B[jl];W[il];B[jm];W[mf]C[BB: White has pushed into my territory big time.  How should I have stopped him earlier?

H.: The problem was that you didn't keep him eyeless, otherwise it wouldn't help him to be here, all dead now, in the middle of your strong stones. If your intention was to prevent him getting here at all, you should have blocked him just early, risking he lives in the bottom right. 

But as stated above, that would have meant defeat. You had to kill.]
;B[md];W[ki];B[kg];W[kh]
(;B[kf];W[lg]C[H.: As he gets it, the fight is over now. White lives.]
;B[ng];W[mi];B[mg];W[lf];B[lh];W[nj];B[le];W[jf]
(;B[ke];W[je];B[jd];W[ie];B[id];W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[hb];W[gk]
C[BB: The rest is mostly endgame stuff that I didn't feel too strongly about one way or another.  Thanks for your comments.

H.: Okay, then my conclusion comes now. Let's collect what we learned.

1.: A moyo is not territory, it's an attacking formation. Don't put yourself into a situation where you have to rely on a moyo becoming all your territory!
2.: When you have the chance to make an enemy group weak, use it!
3.: Don't invade without a very good reason, because getting a weak group is bad!
4.: Know your potential and stick to your strategy to make that potential come to live (for example don't let white split you in bottom right, attack the bottom center when you got the chance).
5.: Attacking a group usually means trying to surround it, keeping it weak (without definite eyespace) while building solid outside influence, and if possible, kill the surrounded group later. Attacking is ~not~ touching enemy stones! That is rather helping him! If you have to kill (and have prospects to do so, because you have influence around), concentrate on keeping him without eyes while staying connected yourself. Don't let him escape your moyo of course!

I want to give you some recommendations for further studying.

1.) Ikuro Ishigure: "In the Beginning". Very good book about fuseki and some early middle game strategy.
2.) Richard Bozulich: "One Thousand and One Life-and-Death Problems". This is where you get the reading strength to actually kill if you have to, or to handle other complicated tactics stuff. Reading is the muscle or good condition of go, so be sure to practice it!
3.) Richard Bozulich: "Get Strong at Attacking". Problems where you can practice attacking strategy.
4.) Michael Redmond: "ABC's of Attack and Defence". He concentrates on fighting principles while showing really many useful examples and variations.

I hope this review was helpful to you. Good luck in your future games!]

(;B[qm]C[H.: So taking his base and hunting that stone into your walls seems necessary. Then the question is: will that walls be solid enough, or does white have weaknesses to aim at? Like around the white stone at K13, and the area around M9.

Here's the point where you would have to use your reading strength to evaluate, if you can actually keep this stone eyeless without getting cut yourself.]

(;B[nm]C[H.: Surround him! Only abandon your plan, if you really can't make it work.

You are right, your knight's jump from M4 looks a bit threatened - all the more it is important that you surround white, build center influence and keep the initiative. That will help you actively to fight back against your weakness. Principle: In a fight move from the weakest stone to balance attack and defence.

If M4 really should get cut off, you can let white have it - you want your center territory (no point in talking of a moyo, because you need that *territory* there). Even if M4 gets cut off, you can use his presence to invade the lower side, maybe at H3, threatening to cross under, creating complications, or something in connection with playing F3.]

))
(;B[qd];W[pe];B[nd];W[pg];B[oi]C[H.: I'm no joseki specialist, but the idea of this sequence is to take away white's base, so that he gets a compressed position without definite eyespace, and then use moves against that group to profit in other areas on the board.

While white is on the run, you will totally settle the upper side and build a moyo at the bottom. If he lives with his stones, he won't have territory, because weak groups get squeezed small. But you will have territory and influence, which you can use to profit in the later phase of the game. For example for invading whites position wherever you want without much danger.]
