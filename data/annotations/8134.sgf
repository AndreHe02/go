AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Ok this was my first 4 stone handi game and i pretty much lost by 30-40 points (i got owned) but black played a huge mistake and i saw it after a little and capitalized and kill almost 50 stones and won by resignation.

i am more concerend about why i lost up to that mistake.

is there any better moves i could have made?

my personal comments are attached.];W[nq];B[qn]C[Goceman86 [13k\]: good luck]
;W[cg]C[TaMako [9k\]: gg];B[gc]LB[fc:A]C[i feel that simitry is always good so instead of A i played at g17.

g17 is a good move, C15 is also joseki];W[cn];B[fq];W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[this is incorrect, C4 is superior];W[cp];B[do];W[co]
;B[pj];W[iq]
(;B[hq]C[decided to take base with the h3 stone


too heavy, L3 or M3 is better, I would have played L3];W[hr]
;B[gr];W[is]
(;B[gs]C[i played here but i felt worried about white coming under and taking some eyespace now that i am reveiwing i notice it was a stupid thing to be scared of

yes, you could have played M3 to split his group and now he is on the run]

[md:B][qf:2][dj:1]C[i thought w1 and b2 was a fair trade but i am curious if somewhere else would be bigger like A B or C or somethign along those lines

R14 is fine, I would have preferred O17 but its the same really, see the idea behind b2 is theat in case he invades you get a strong wall and use the others stones as moyo, and if he aproaches you settle in the corner and use the others stones to attack]

;W[ph]C[i felt this white stone was a good reduction attempt

not really, this move is too early, and W is very weak in this zone]
;B[qh];W[qi]
(;B[rh]C[this was a mistake, cutting with Q11 was much better. dont be afraid to be aggressive while defending]
;W[pi];B[qk]LB[qj:A]C[this was a miss click i wanted to play at A but it worked out ok]

;B[rl];W[qj];B[qm];W[sj];B[sl];W[oj];B[pk];W[od]C[saw white has good frame work now at least thats what i felt]

;W[og];B[pg]LB[mg:A]C[i realize this is not the right move and that i should have just kept him cut by playing at A

yes it was better, but you can avoid being cut threating P11 and gaining a tempo]

;B[hm];W[in];B[il];W[km];B[kj]LB[lg:A][gn:B]C[felt this was a good move because either why white plays i can either connect to my A or B groups]
;W[ki];B[jj];W[ji];B[ij];W[ii];B[hj];W[fj]
(;B[ll]C[felt it was strong to connect my two groups

it doesnt have much sense to connect 2 groups that are already alive, try instead attacking by reducing his territory, since he is winning, a move like N5 would have been within my style]

;W[ee];B[ed];W[gf]LB[ge:A]C[i played A because i was afraid of the cuts that might happen if i tenukied and white took A

nothing happens, tennuki is better, a move like B17 gives you more points]

;B[jm]C[this was also a misclick but he didnt cut idk why he didnt

any ideas?];W[jn];B[im];W[ik]C[so this small mistake so i capitalized]
;B[jk];W[hk];B[gk];W[fk];B[hl];W[fl];B[gi]LB[eh:B][jh:A]C[decided to stop whites A and B groups from connecting

in this case it doesnt matter if they connect or not. both groups are very alive and connecting doesnt add or substract any points]

actually it was L12 becouse M11 doesnt work]

(;W[ac]SQ[li]C[he didnt answer my Marked stone so i attacked]

Goceman86 [12k\]: good game
Goceman86 [12k\]: just saw those weakness at the end
Goceman86 [12k\]: i got lucky i saw them
Goceman86 [12k\]: ^^
TaMako [9k\]: ^^
Goceman86 [12k\]: i really thought you won
TaMako [9k\]: thanks

Well my recommendatin is that connecting 2 groups is not always a good thing, is strong for them to be potentially connected in the early stage of the game, try to play a little lighter, too many heavy moves.
