C[Hello, I'm Julien, 2k. I will add comments and variations to your game.]
;B[pd]C[Sadmarkyl [7k?\]: hello];W[qp];B[dc]C[towlon [7k\]: hi]
;W[dp];B[ce];W[kp]TR[jc][qf]C[It is more usual to answer black corner enclosure either at K17 or R14. But I can't definitively say that your move is bad.]
;B[jd]C[At this point, I feel it's gonna be a tough game.

Maybe because you tenuki the black corner enclosure?];W[pj]
C[I would have prefer R14 in order to get the wider possible space. But, once again, I can't say that your move is bad.]
;B[dj]C[At this point, I prefer black. When both side plays influence like this in the beginning, black has one more move. So he is usually in advance.]

(;W[ee]C[1st  question mark here :)

I think it is a good move.];B[dg];W[ec]C[Trying to play against the strong stones

This sequence is usual.];B[db]C[I think this reply was really good]

(;W[id];B[je]C[I don't like this exchange because it strenghtens black too much.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[hc];B[md]TR[jc][kc][id][je]C[Strange

Yes, it is. Should be at M16.

But I don't like the marked exchange so much.];W[hf]C[making shape, but prospects are bleak

I think it is almost ok for both (except N16).];B[cn]
(;W[cl]C[2nd question mark here :)

I don't think this is the right direction... You usually play the open side. It is not this one, but the other one.]

(;B[cq]
(;W[cp]MA[dq]C[3rd :) It was probably better to play here but what about the cut at the end]
;B[bp]
(;W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[er];W[fq];B[dl]C[Strange move.];W[cm]

(;W[of];B[mf]
(;W[nh]C[I don't really like this one, it serves no purpose

You're right ;-).];B[np];W[oo]C[Good direction.];B[mo]
(;W[mq]C[A bit strange to play in both directions.]
(;B[oq]C[Black is a nice guy, not too agressive ;-)];W[pr];B[or]
;W[pq];B[mm];W[om];B[hr]C[This time, black is too agressive ;-).]
;W[fr]C[Good answer. Threaten the corner.];B[hp];W[fo];B[hn]
;W[kn];B[mk];W[kl];B[hl];W[kj];B[mi];W[hj];B[gk];W[dr]C[Nicely played :-).]

;B[gi]C[Now you have an easy game. No more comment.

You played well in this game. Maybe you could improve your opening and your overall judgement: where is the biggest place to play? Which side is the biggest one?

Hope this helps.

Yes it is (equal development continuing, but black has one more move). The more you wait to attack, the more difficult the game will be.]
