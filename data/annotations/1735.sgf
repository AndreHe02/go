;W[oe]C[This feels a bit panicky... Playing on the left looks bigger to me.]
;B[pf];W[rd]C[If W wants to play here, he shouldn't exchange P15 for R14 first.
If you make a plan, you need to stick with it  -- if you change your mind you might end up with nothing at all.]

;W[cj];B[co];W[cm];B[fq]C[This move is bad - means B wants to (temporarily) sacrifice C5 to build on the right, but the right side is small because W can jump in at O2.]
;W[ep];B[bq]C[now B is changing his mind. If he wants to play here to settle his left side stone, he should do so immidiately - and it's a heavy move anyway.]
;W[en];B[cn];W[dm];B[iq]C[B is not quite alive in the corner, so C2 is the correct move instead of J3.]
;W[br];B[cq];W[cr];B[bm]C[By struggling with his dead stones, B accomplishes nothing but wasting ko threats and making W outside stronger. It's important to leave dead stones as early as possible to have the maximum amount of aji (future possibilities) later...]
;W[bl];B[am];W[bp];B[cp];W[aq]C[now it should be obvious to B his stones are dead, if he saw this position in a problem book he would have no doubt. So the mistake is not in reading but in refusing to let go.]
;B[eo];W[fo];B[dp];W[eq];B[fp];W[do];B[de];W[cg];B[ec]C[This move is not joseki, but it is quite interesting anyway. It (correctly) emphasizes the upper side. A more high-level approach to this situation would be to play D15 at G16, to make miai of D15 and K16.]

(;W[eb]C[This response feels too low. Your first instinct should be to separate the two B stones.]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[gb]C[This looks like an overplay, just letting W crawl along the second line is more than good enough.]
