C[Howard [10k\]: hi
Howard [9k\]: This is a very recent game that I played as black although I am shown as the winner that is because white sat there for about 1 and a half minutes without playing another move. According to the score estimator I lost by 2.5 points. This is four games "lost" in a row so I am doing a lot wrong and in the longer term I am just not improving. Would it be possible to


{{I'll include my comments in double brackets like this. In general, don't worry about losing streaks and so on. If you're very anxious to improve more quickly, you can do tsumego and tesuji problems, on top of playing lots of games.}}


{{OVERALL COMMENTS.................................. (1) Corners, then sides, then the center. You seem to have an ok grasp on this idea in the opening, but by the middle game and the endgame you've completely forgotten it. You left the lower left open for an absurdly long time, and later you were dicking around with small, one-point moves when there were easily a dozen points to be had on un-closed off parts of the side. (2) This game didn't seem to show awareness of the strength or weakness of enemy groups, or how you could use that weakness to get the biggest points on the board. (3) Look for multi-purpose moves. Make territory while attacking, make territory while reducing, etc. etc. etc. F5 was the biggest multipurpose move that you missed. --------------- You seem to be strongest at your endgame, so don't get discouraged. Everyone needs to be strong at some parts of the game and weak at others. I'm usually behind 10-20 points going into the endgame, myself. Your endgame will get even stronger if you learn to identify large, sente endgame reductions along the side. Don't play moves that get you an extra point, but then turn an entire sente sequence into gote.}}]
;B[qd]C[justed [10k\]: gey
Howard [9k\]: Would it be possible to have a look at this and give some pointers to where i am going wrong.]
;W[dp];B[dd]C[justed [10k\]: hey
Howard [10k\]: hi];W[jc]
(;B[pq]C[Howard [9k\]: White 4 surprised me and since if I approach from one side he will just extend on the other a miao situation i decided to play in the vacant corner.

{{Miai. --- It's not perfectly miai, since one of the the approaches is bigger than the other. See variation. --- The way you played is fine, though.}}]
;W[qk];B[oc]C[Howard [9k\]: White 6 prompted me to strengthen the top right corner.]
;W[dj]
(;B[fq]LB[cq:A]TR[qk]C[Howard [9k\]: I considered playing R5 but dismissed that since it was clear that white would play around K3 K4 crating a double wing formation. I now think that maybe I should have played at L3 or L4but i decided to play a standard approach to D4

{{The double-wing formation is good, but taking an enclosure is also very good. Note that after you take an enclosure, the marked White stone is threatened. Even after the double wing formation, the corner is still open at "A". --- See variations.}}]
;W[cm];B[qo]C[Howard [9k\]: This move again surprised me.
Howard [9k\]: So I decided to make this shimari amybe I should have dived into D2 though

{{I like the shimari. Never be afraid to tenuki from a joseki. People get too hung up on "Oh, I need to finish the joseki." You played one stone, you forced him to play a stone that (you think) is not too good, and now that you've seen what strategy he is committed to, you can play elsewhere. ----- Also remember that this move threatens R9, so you can expect a response.}}]
;W[pg]LB[qh:A]C[Howard [9k\]: Another to me odd looking move, but since my corner was safe

{{It's not that odd. This move and "A" are what you would expect.}}]
;B[dr]C[Howard [9k\]: I played here to settle F3];W[ce]C[Howard [9k\]: This is an unusual approach.]
;B[cd]C[Howard [9k\]: I decided to play solidly ( and heavily)]
;W[gd];B[fc];W[gc];B[de]LB[me:B][ff:A][jn:C]C[Howard [9k\]: I thought my corner was looking weak by now and White looked to be trying to build a big central moyo so I played this to stop being blocked into a small corner with white gaining a thick wall facing the side and middle.

{{I like this move, but don't be afraid of White's alleged "moyo". It's open in three places. When a moyo is open in two places, it is hard to make points, because the two openings are miai for a reduction. When a moyo is open in three places....}}]
;W[cf];B[lc]LB[fo:A][jp:C][cq:B]C[Howard [9k\]: I felt I needed to extend against this white froup and extend my corner. Looking now I see the bottom is still empty and maybe i should have played here.

{{This is decently big, but yes, the bottom is fairly huge. Just to discuss some merits of the moves.... "A" tries to sketch out a moyo on a grand scale, all across the bottom. White can definitely reduce, but he won't be able to prevent you getting a nice amount of profit, and it blocks his development at the same time. (Compare the difference when White plays there first. --- "B" take the corner. Here I think that taking profit in the corner is somewhat short-sighted, because it neglects the power of the lower right enclosure. Further, taking away the corner doesn't threaten White's group at all. But Go Seigen says, the corner is always bigger. --- "C" seems to be too modest. It takes a firmer grasp of the bottom territory than A, but how does Black expand his moyo from here? After A, he can play at F7 or Q8, practically doubling the size of the moyo, but after C, either of those large extensions seem lopsided and loose. Besides, C doesn't inhibit White's development. I prefer A. ------------------- But anyway, M17 isn't a bad move. It just doesn't do anything else in addition to taking a little bit of territory and making the corner a little more secure.}}]
;W[ke];B[iq]C[Howard [9k\]: Since he didn't I did and completed the joseki.

{{Ack! Complete the joseki!?!? No no no. Don't complete joseki like a schoolboy reciting his lessons. Whole-board thinking!}}]

;W[mk];B[df]C[{{Ack, urgh. Hard to know what to say about this. My gut is against it -- the situation on the right side is very hot right now, but......... this is pretty big. After C13, you would have annihalated a chunk of W's left side. ---------- If White can't ignore you, this is an excellent move, and it's good that you got it in. If White can ignore you, then it was a big mistake. Sorry I can't be more precise! :) }}]
;W[ch];B[mp]C[Howard [9k\]: i decided that I needed to complete the lower side and it seemed like tthe biggest point on the board/

{{No, absolutely not. There's a fight on around P11. That has to take priority, otherwise your cutting stones will just be a waste.}}]

C[Howard [9k\]: So by now I was a long way behind and am at a loss what to do other than resign.

{{Never resign! You have three corners (ABC) and can take a fourth (D). You can continue to reduce the center in certain sente (EF), and after White responds you may be able to reduce further. You have two moves that enlarge your territory along the edge while shrinking the opponent's to nothing. And besides, both players will probably make several huge mistakes before the game ends.}}]
