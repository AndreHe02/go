C[i played this game as black as a six kyu on TOM. i was leading throughout the game, but unfortunately i made some unintelligent choices that turned the tables for white and i ended up losing just a little bit to white. it was a big pity, but i supposed i needed some little help with my overall play. please give me some comments and adivce that would help me improve my game, thx!!

Hi,
Thanks for the opportunity to review  this game.
Please don't take my comments as the truth. They are just some possibilities.
I hope you enjoy this one.
I precede my comments with g4.
go4fun];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[fq];B[oc];W[cn];B[jj]C[since white started off wierdly, i thought i'll start off with a force crushing tengen move, controlling the entire board's movement direction.

g4: This is a matter of taste. You should play in a way  to  use this stone efficiently or there is a chance that is has been played superfluous.]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[ol];W[po]
(;B[qo]C[g4: This way white can get R6  and connect to the other stones. I would keep white seperated as both groups  are weak.]

(;W[oo]C[a bit slow for white i think.

g4: I whould have chosen to connect.];B[nq];W[qn]C[g4: Good]
;B[qp];W[qm]C[g4: This is completely wrong. It forces you to separate both groups getting stronger. And it doesn't give complete eye shape.]
;B[qk];W[mo];B[on];W[nn];B[rj]C[g4: You should leave your P6 move unplayed if you planned this one. White may take the one stone and is nearly alive.]
;W[re];B[ri];W[rd];B[rc];W[rh]
(;B[pj]C[white lost plenty of points at the upper right corner, should i have continued attacking?

g4: You should attack only if you get something of value in terms of territory (preferred) or strength. In this situation it seems better to surround black and let him live on a small scale.]
;W[mq]C[g4: Maybe this is too small.];B[mr];W[lq];B[np]C[g4: This forces white to life.]

(;W[nm]C[g4: Why not P7? White must not fear  the cut. And this leaves black P7 as a strong move which cuts off some white stones.]
;B[dp];W[hp];B[lr];W[kq];B[eo];W[dl];B[eq];W[fr]C[g4: On the bottom there is little territory because of M2. Therefore F4 seems better.]
;B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[kr]C[white is pretty thick here eh? but i think i'm leading in terroritory.

g4: This is very difficult to say. I don't think that you have a lot of definite territory. There is the lower right corner. That are counted conservatively only 14 points. And the upper right corner. That are about 6 points. The lower left is completely open because of the possible invasion  at C3. White in return has only 6 points on the bottom. 
But there are so many big points on the board that it is much to early to count.]
;B[cj]C[starting my attack

g4: You force white to connect with his lower group creating a strong group and the beginning  of a moyo. Perhaps a simple kakari at F17 is appropiate.]
;W[bn]C[g4: This just helps black to close the corner.];B[bo]
;W[gm]C[g4: Good.];B[fc];W[cf];B[cg]C[to close i think...should i have attacked later?

g4: This is not an attacking move. When attaching you make both groups stronger. This is a defensive move. But I think this is just what you need now. Your C10 stone lookes very lonely.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[dh]C[g4: Forcing black to good shape.];B[ce]
C[g4: D11 is the shape move. The move you played can lead to a very difficult fight if white fights back.]

(;W[ci]C[g4: One possibility.];B[bi];W[di]C[g4: This is safe.]
;B[bf]
(;W[df]C[g4: Nice shape but inefficient. The white wall faces some black stones. It  will  be hard to   use this  thickness. I had preferred the cut to get territory.]
;B[bk]C[g4: This  leaves a cut at B15. Better to play B12 or B13 with no weakness at all.]
;W[be]C[g4: Of course.];B[ag];W[bd]C[white's mistake

g4: C16 is a little bigger.];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed]C[g4: Too close to the wall and forcing black into  good shape.]
;B[ec];W[pp]C[g4: Just endgame.];B[qq];W[nl];B[ok];W[ic]C[g4: This leave the weakness at O5 behind. Black has the big move at P7! And this creates a second weak group. The upper right group is not secure. If black  manages to get a splitting attack  he will  win.]
;B[kc];W[ie];B[ke]C[g4: Keeping white separated. F16 or G15  may work.]
;W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[hc]C[g4: This makes no territory and creates no weakness nor helps it to make eyeshape or gets an  extra liberty. This is only dangerous.]
;W[ib];B[bc];W[fa]C[g4: Too far. Better at G19 to  retain sente. But  this is an endgame  move anyway  and shoul be played later.]
;B[ea];W[ga];B[fb];W[hb];B[pf]C[g4: Creates territory while attacking, good!]
;W[ph];B[ng]C[white is trying to escape];W[nh];B[og]C[g4: I don't like this one. It fixes white's shape. If white captures at P7 your S10 group may come under attack.]
;W[oh];B[nj];W[lh];B[mh]C[g4: Helping white.];W[mi];B[mg];W[ni]
;B[lj]C[should of played at N10 eh? this move allowed white to escape.

g4: You should be careful. The black group  may come under attack if white has time for P7]
;W[mj];B[li]C[g4: Very dangerous. White can save his group  with O9 at any time and black creates a very  weak group in white's influence.]
;W[mk]C[g4: Not necessary. If black N9, white O9, black P10 white M9 and white is connected.]

(;B[qi]C[g4: You should play P7!];W[qf]C[g4: Why? Just L12 and black will have a hard time.]
;B[pe]
(;W[jh];B[kh];W[kg];B[lg];W[ki];B[lh];W[ji];B[ej]C[g4: Can be cut. E10 is safer.]
;W[dj];B[dk];W[ek];B[ck];W[fk];B[er]C[g4: Not small but it is gote. Reducing white's moyo in sente is bigger. I would start with L10.]
;W[gp]C[g4: Small];B[kl];W[lk];B[kj];W[hi];B[il]C[g4: You can K6.]
;W[jn]C[i think black is winning by a good deal of points because i have four corners, but is white's thickness in the middle helping it weaken my tengen move?

g4: Your tengen move didn't help you that much. But now it is not the time to  discuss that. 
First you  look after all unsettled issues. 
Then you should count.
I try to give some hints with some variations.]
(;B[bm];W[am];B[al];W[ao];B[ap];W[an];B[bq];W[rb]C[white's attack and my mistake, i should have played at R18 instead, but i accidently made a caculation mistake and let white live.

g4: I don't hink that white can live there. I would have cut there with T17.]
;B[sc];W[pb];B[qb]C[g4: Perhaps R17. But anyway I don't see white live.]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[lb];B[kb];W[mc]
(;B[md]C[g4: Why not O18?];W[pc];B[qc];W[pd];B[qe];W[nb];B[oe]
C[g4: O16 or M17 and white cannot live.];W[nd];B[od];W[ld];B[me]
;W[lc];B[kd];W[le]C[g4: A mistake in the order of moves.]
(;B[lf]C[g4:  M19 and white is still dead.];W[ma];B[pa]C[g4: Much too small. 1 Point in gote.]
;W[oa];B[qa];W[ka];B[ja]C[g4: Very risky White can cut at L14.]
;W[la];B[jb]C[White has a big lead AND leaves a big dangerous cut at L14 for black.]
;W[ac];B[ab];W[ad]C[g4: Better at A15];B[ba];W[jm];B[jl];W[fn]
LB[fm:A][fn:B]C[this was really small, i had to start catching up.]
;B[gk];W[hk];B[hl];W[gl];B[hj];W[gj];B[ij];W[ii];B[ll];W[nk]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[kn];W[ko]C[gotta protect the cut since white got thicker at the sides]
;B[jg];W[jf];B[kf];W[ig];B[no];W[om];B[mn];W[rl];B[rk];W[rm]
C[g4: Better at S5.];B[ro];W[sf];B[pm];W[pn];B[pl];W[sd];B[qh]

;W[ls];B[nr];W[es];B[ds];W[fs];B[cr];W[fo];B[cl];W[cm];B[bl]
C[white has a big big lead now, but why it started a KO is a question to me.]

;B[ae];W[km];B[ml];W[af];B[bg];W[ah];B[ae];W[da];B[eb];W[af]
;B[el]C[g4: ???  B12 capturing the group is  BIG. Black has to defend at A10. Capturing a stone at D8 make no more eyes.]
;W[dm];B[ae];W[lm];B[mm];W[af];B[bh];W[fd]C[now white forced me to fill up my own terroritory and therefore i have almost already lost.]
;B[je];W[kg];B[jc];W[id];B[jg];W[hm];B[if];W[hf];B[hg]C[started a KO myself in desperation, except i couldn't see any better way to end game. could you point out maybe a better way?

g4: Now the endgame is nearly settled. The Ko is big and a good one for you. It  is the biggest endgame move for you I think.]
;W[jf];B[en];W[em];B[if];W[ih]C[darn, should have continued at G11, to put white at a bad position, but this was the last chance for me to win, and i missed it!

g4: Yes! G11 is a big threat. I don't see how white could handle this.]
;B[jf];W[gg];B[ae]C[g4: Nearly to nothing. N1, J7 are sente and theror much bigger. All other 1 point gote moves also also bigger.
Let's try a normal endgame.];W[ep];B[do];W[fm];B[af];W[fp]C[rest is normal endgame.

g4: But the biggest  moves  are played at last.
N1, N4, J7 J9 followed by L9.];B[ia];W[kk];B[sk];W[sn];B[so]

;W[in];B[ik];W[gk];B[pi];W[tt];B[jk];W[tt];B[oi];W[rf]C[i lost by 2.5 points to white. i tried to catch up near the end, but i still failed to so. overall it was a close game which i have pitifully lost, i think it was because i miscaculated white's life and death at the top. please leave some comments and perhaps some advice for me. thx for looking at my game!

g4: Your feeling was right, that white cannot live at the top. You missed some possibilities. The cut on the right side was never played, the atari with the Ko in the center. With this moves you should have won. You played a territory oriented game. 
At least you  should be careful about your strong groups. When attacked in the right way some of your groups might have died. 
But I think you are on the right way.

Totals to 74 points.
White: 30 points in the center, 20 points lower side 5 ponts on the right side. 
Totals to 55 points.
White has to make about 15 points. That is nearly impossible.
But bear in mind, that the key ponit is the capture of the 2 white stones on the right side. You never played this. Without this  move it is a very close game, I think slightly better for white.]
