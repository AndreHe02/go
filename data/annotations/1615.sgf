AB[pd][dp][dd][pp]C[phi: black 11k? philipp gressly (phi@gressly.ch)
ste: white 6k? stephan

phi: We are both interessted in the game record.
Please comment the most important errors (mistakes) of both players.
Don't comment every single move, but the most obvious points and patterns.

rimas: Hi.

I mostly commented Black's moves (as this was much easier ;-)).

Some general hints...

For both:  This is a 4-stone handicap game. Strategies differ from 6-9 stone handicaps as Black has no stones on the sides.

For White:
 You don't have to play so risky as in high-handicap games. Your strategy should be to build stable groups without giving too much away to Black. Then use these stable groups as bases for attacks (invading and reducing)

For Black:
 You have only 4 stones handicap. That means the usual high-handicap strategies like "Connect own stones, seperate enemy groups" and "run towards the center" don't work so well here.

Of course, you start with stones on the fourth line. So your strategy is influence-oriented from the beginning. But you should look more for moves which create territory while attacking White's weak groups.]
;W[fc];B[df];W[nc]LB[db:a][cc:b][ic:c][cj:d][nf:e]C[rimas: This is a bit too thin.   W should consider playing just the usual joseki A-B-C-D. He gets a stable group and keeps sente. Also, it still leaves enough invasion points behind to create trouble for B later.

The most important point for W is to create stable groups which can be used as a base for attacks later.]
;B[jd]C[rimas: good move. W has now two weak stones to care for.]
;W[pf]
(;B[oe]C[rimas: This is too good for W. See variation for a different idea.]
;W[qi]LB[qc:a]C[rimas: W should invade at A. No matter on what side B blocks, W will get a satisfying result.]
;B[jp];W[qn]
(;B[pn]TR[qn][qi]C[rimas: Playing this attachment is not good for B. He forces W to settle his right side. The two marked white stones are very far apart with various potential invasion points in between. B should keep these options open. See variations.]
;W[pm];B[qo];W[on];B[po];W[om];B[np]LB[nq:a][lq:b][lp:c]TR[jp]
[pp]C[rimas: W has settled the right side and even got sente.

If you play this joseki you might consider playing at A instead of O4. This will make an invasion at B or C more difficult and takes sure territory in the corner.

You could also describe it like this: the two marked stones and A form a better balance (3rd and 4th line balance).]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[ch]TR[fc][nc]C[rimas: Again too thin and risky. W has to keep in mind that he already has two weak stones at the top. Better play for a stable group and attack later.]

(;B[cg]C[rimas: D13 is no good. B forces again W to strengthen himself. See variation.]
;W[dh];B[fg]LB[bg:a][db:b]TR[fc][nc]C[phi: I felt of getting "sealed into the corner". So i rushed into the center.

rimas: In this case, you should take the corner by playing A and B. This gives you about 18 points in sente. And W will have a hard time with his two weak stones at the top.

Running out with F13 doesn't help you much here. This move doesn't attack any of W's groups and also creates no potential territory.]
;W[lq]
(;B[mq]LB[qm:a]C[rimas: Wrong direction. Your right corner is safe. The left part of the bottom is weaker. So you should attack from that side. See variation.]
;W[lp];B[mn]LB[np:A][lp:B][om:C][mo:D][jq:a][qm:b]C[phi: I wanted to run away with A and to cross whites sector-line (BC). But D seamed too weak.
But now I think its not important to run over a sector line, if you are living.  What would you have done: run into the center or secure the corner for live?

rimas: B's corner is secure as B has F in reserve. So the right strategy should be to attack W's stones with E, driving him out into the center and building territory at the left bottom.]
;W[jq];B[hq];W[ip];B[hp];W[io];B[hn];W[kn];B[lm]LB[mo:a][jm:b]
C[rimas: This move serves no purpose. W's bottom group is already alive. And B's two stones can be cut off with A. Driving W out into the center is counter-productive.

W's groups on the left side and top are very weak and nice targets for attack. Even the right side has some weak points. So later in the game you might be interested in attacking W's bottom group from above, forcing him to live at the bottom and building thickness towards the center. So now better leave the situation as it is.]
;W[jl];B[cl];W[dl]
(;B[dm]LB[cm:a]C[rimas: You can also continue with A. But this may lead to some difficult variations. See variation for one example.]

;B[cp];W[bl];B[do];W[bp];B[bq];W[bo]C[rimas: B lost this local fight with a very bad result.]
;B[br]LB[db:a]C[rimas: This is an endgame move, too small at this stage. Moves like A are more important here.   This is also where W should go now to settle his weak stones at the top.]
;W[gl]LB[db:a]C[rimas: W should worry about the top. G7 doesn't do any harm to B nor does it do anything for W.]

(;B[hc]C[rimas: Wrong direction. See variation.];W[cc];B[dc]
;W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[be];B[cd];W[bd]TR[nc]C[rimas: This is a better outcome for W: comfortable life in the corner, and the marked stone has more space to breathe.]
;B[jf]LB[fc:A]TR[nc]C[phi: I want to enclose A.

rimas: This is not good enough. A is as good as captured already. The white marked stone has to be attacked now. This is also an urgent spot for W.]

;B[rl]C[phi: was this not threathening enough? I guess the value of the Ko to about 12 points and my move to about 15 points, because it threatens to hane on R9.
