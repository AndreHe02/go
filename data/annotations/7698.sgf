;W[pj];B[hc];W[ce];B[cd];W[bd];B[bc];W[dd];B[cc]C[Interesting moves here. It reminds me of Hikaru No Go. This sort of play is called 'light' play, or 'sabaki'. See all those chances to cut? When we play lightly like this, we don't expect all the stones to live. That's the price for being about to expand quickly.

(Read move 15 notes before reading next part)

In order to make a base (that's top priority now. If W has no base, that forces W to make difficult small life and gives B control of the game), moves such as C12 or B12 aid W to make a base. Sure, B16 will die, but W's group overall is more mobile and can expand more easily. After trading B16, W should strengthen D16.]
(;W[ad]TR[kc][kq]C[A16 is not worth many points at the moment. The board still has lots of 'large points' to take, such as the triangled spots, but I understand that W isn't ready to take these triangles yet, as the group on the left is unconsolidated. It has no base.]

Connection is key here. W must stay connected to the main group. Since W does not have enough space to make 2 eyes, and B is too solid for W to kill, the only way for W to reduce is to stay connected.]

(;W[qs]C[B should be very cautious and make sure B gets all the necessary points for life. P1 is not one of them, in fact, it creates an opening for W to use. B needs to be conservative about eyespace. 

Since P1 needs Q1 as defence, it wastes a move and is a dangerous move for B to play.]
;B[ps]C[If B does not play Q1, W can kill P1 and connect back. Then B would be doomed.

There a lot of variations, so I'll just through a common 2.]

You were right in choosing not to invade. If B plays the right direction, W would have died.]

C[D9 and E8 are sacrificed. They cannot:
a)Make 2 eyes
b) connect back
c) kill B in order to connect back

But these 2 stones weren't completely useless, they helped G7 to force B to play F7. (Still, there were better variations for W.)]

TR[jq]C[...N3 like in the game, then K3-N3 is a strong combo. No way to cut it and it's much stronger than a 'Knight' move.]
)))
(;W[kc]C[This is effectively putting the "Corner-Side-Centre' theory to work.

The idea goes that make territory is most effecient in the corner, then the side, and lastly the centre. You need less stones to make the same amount of terr in the corner, than in the centre.
That's why we play and protect the corners adn sides before expanding into the centre.

L17 still gives you a wall to protect your area, but it is more effecient than L15 since L17 is in the vicinity of P17 and R16. With L17 W is very strong at the top right corner.]

[bh:B][cj:C]C[Sorry, this didn't turn out as well I wanted it to. A is likely to be sacrificed. B can be strengthen, then used to fight, by attacking C. From looking at this game, there wasn't a lot of fighting involved, so I will more closely to your questions.]

[dh]C[Similar situation as the one above, but now B group has good shape. The triangles are the ideal good shape, it's almost an eye and is very strong when you're in the need to make good eyespace. Even though the shape is not complete, B still has good shape. Group B definately has one eye, and can easily expand on the side or towards to centre to make its second eye.

By sacrificing a few stones, W can make good shape and give a better chance for the remaining group.

(Group A, even though it can be thought as a sacrifice, can be used to pressure black. So, not completely a waste.)]

)
(;B[be];W[ee];B[bf]TR[dd][ce][ee][df]C[B takes the base from the bottom, but the trade-off is that W gets a strong shape (triangled) "ponnuki" facing the centre. There are not many ways of getting close to this shape, if B gets too close without the necessary B stones nearby, W can overpower B. Eitherway, W will find it easy to make a second eye.

If you followed this discussion up to this point, then you are doing extremely well. Light play is a hard topic to understand, and it's hard to read ahead and decide which stones are important. But as you play more games, it'll make more sense.]
