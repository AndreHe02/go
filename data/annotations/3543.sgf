C[BastianSeegeb: Hi. Thanks for reviewing my game!
This was my first even game against 1d on IGS. The opening is rather unspectacular. I'm mainly interested about a better way to attack white's left and top-side groups or anything else that would've done better at the time.]
;B[qe];W[dp];B[oq];W[dd];B[fq];W[ip]
(;B[cq]LB[cn:C][fo:B][cq:A]C[BastianSeegeb: Would've one of the variations been better with the 5-3 stone in the lower right? (I know it's difficult to make statements about that this early in the game...)

Difficult question. I think that this way of playing is good and simple. When white plays 18 as an extension towards the 5-3 stone, you can be happy with your response at 19 making a shimari (which is almost always good on its own). The results is that white has approaced your strong formation, which is not normally a good idea for white.

(Actually, white 6 might be better at A.)]
(;W[dq]C[(This is, of course, the right move for white.)];B[cp]
;W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]
(;W[dn]C[This is a mistake by white.];B[cm];W[lq];B[qp]C[You want to make a shimari the the first available opportunity, and white has just helped by giving you that opportunity. You are happy.

Also, note that the black stone at F3 is by no means captured. Later in the game you can look forwards to running away with it (perhaps starting at G4) and this may split white into two weak groups.]
;W[qj];B[ql]C[Good. You would like to extend from your shimari if possible, and this is also the wider extension on this side.

(If I was white, I would have played the last move one space lower at R9, to make your choice more difficult.)]
;W[qg]
(;B[pc]C[Probably not the best. See variation.];W[kc]
(;B[fc]C[BastianSeegeb: I tried to get a double attack on the R13+R10 and L17 groups. Good idea to do it like this?

I don't think so. White's last move was good, becuase he has left space for a two-space extension of either side, so you cannot really expect to attack L17.

Also, you move is not very good. It is obviouls that white will play H17, the perfect move for attacking your stone and defending his. Try to avoid giving your opponent such an obvious good move.

If you really want to try this plan, you would be better starting with J17 (see variation). 

Generally speaking, however, it is better to approach a stone like D16 from the other side (C15 or D14). That is, you expand you own area on the right side, while limiting white's expansion at the top. White has to defend, so you probably keep sente.]
;W[hc];B[mc]C[BastianSeegeb: I didn't want to enter the corner because my attack would've been gone then so I switched my plan.

If I was white, I would immediately play F16 to suppress your stone. What would you do after that?]
;W[eb]C[This is not a good move by white. F16 is better.]
(;B[gc]C[The proverb says "don't play in contact with stones you want to attack"

It is right.];W[hd]C[See, you have just forced white to strengthen himself.]
;B[fe];W[cg]C[White's shape here is very thin. I don't like it. Later in the game you will probably be able to live in the corner.]
;B[fg];W[ef];B[ge]C[It is probably better shape to connect solidly at F14.]
;W[if];B[hg]C[You have played very slowly here. You have used 6 stones to make zero eyes and not get very far into the centre. (I think that part of the problem is making the bamboo joint, not the solid connection last time.)]
;W[ig];B[ph]C[What is the point of this move?

Again you are playing a (almost) contact move against a weak white group, which just encourages white to strengthen it. 

This move aims to make strength in the centre, but I don't see what good that would do. The white group in the middle at the top is quite strong now, so I think you have to give up attacking it.

What else could you do?

Well, C11 is probably the biggest territoryial move around. It also helps the black stones at the top and weakens the corner, and threatens to play G4 or something. 

Or you could try G4 or whatever you want to do at the bottom directly. That attempts to give white two quite weak groups, but then black will also have two weak groups (the one at the top and the one you have just added a stone to).

Or you could attack the white stones on the right from one side or the other. Perhaps S9?]
;W[qh]
(;B[pi]C[This is bad (as white's next move demonstrates). Normally black plays Q10.

(This is a vital shape point, but here staying connected is more important.)]
;W[pj];B[qi];W[ri];B[rh];W[rg];B[rj];W[sh]
(;B[oj]C[BastianSeegeb: Or would s9 be better here? He would run to where I wanted to build territory then so I thought this would do better

I think S9 is better. The problem in the game is that white gets a stone at S9, so you territory is open at the side. Also you are left with cutting points in the middle.]
;W[rk];B[pk];W[sj];B[hi]C[This is the wrong place to defend. What would you do if white cut at P9 now?]
;W[pg]C[White misses his chance.];B[le]C[BastianSeegeb: Should this have been more brutal? For example with L15?

I don't think it is possible to attack this white group. It can just make two eyes. And becuase of Q13, this does not really expand the black area much.

I think it is time for G4. Your stone at H11 would be useful in a fight.]
;W[ke];B[kf];W[kd];B[lf];W[md];B[ld];W[lc];B[nc]C[Better at N18, since you are trying to attack white.]
;W[ng]C[White should still be cutting at P9.];B[mh];W[nh];B[ni]
;W[ne]C[White should still be cutting at P9.];B[he];W[ie];B[gb]
;W[hb]
(;B[fo]C[BastianSeegeb: I didn't know where to continue on the top so tried to attack here. or should I've played something like L4 imediately?

The problem with this move is that it does not separate the two halves of the white group.

I still like G4.

The L4 idea might work, but the centre is thin, and it is always suprisingly difficult to make centre territory.

H4 might also be interesting. See the variation.]
(;W[gq]C[Mistake by white.];B[fr];W[fp];B[gp];W[ep]
(;B[es]C[Terrible move. Don't worry about one or two stones. Think about the big picture.]
;W[go];B[ho];W[hp];B[gn];W[gp];B[in];W[fm]C[What is white doing? White shold play M5 or something, so you can't make centre territory.]
;B[kp];W[kq];B[lp];W[mp]
(;B[mo]LB[mo:A][mq:B]C[Yes, B looks better.];W[np];B[no];W[op]
;B[pq]C[This is bad. You are just forcing white into what should be your area.]
;W[oo];B[ih];W[qo]C[I still think white should play P9.];B[nr]
;W[mr];B[nm]C[Now most of your stones are problaby safe. 

Estimating the score, I think that black is winning.

Black

Bottom left: 15
Bottom right: 10
Top right: 15
Centre: ?

Total: 40 + centre.


White

Right: 5
Bottom: 15
Top: 10
Top left: 20
Komi and prisonser: 10

Total: 60

So you need more than 20 in the centre to win, and it looks more like 30 at the moment.

However, black has some thin bits, so white may be able to fight back.

There is a very big move on the left side.];W[rp];B[rq];W[ol]

C[BastianSeegeb: I didn't feel so much behind now but it seems now that it was already hopeless here.

Yes. White had gained about 10 points, and your centre has shrunk to 15, so if the last count was right, you are probably about 15 behind.]
;W[hk];B[ij];W[jg]C[Small. C9 is much bigger.];B[kh]C[Also small. C11 is bigger.]
;W[cj];B[re]C[This is also too small. 

The only white territory you have got a chance against is in the top left. You must do something before white defends, or you may as well resign.]
;W[ro];B[mb];W[lb];B[cc]C[BastianSeegeb: I hoped I could do something here to combine with c11.

Well, you have to try something.];W[dc]

;W[cb];B[bb]C[You are still making it too easy for white.];W[cd]

If you were a professional, you would read out all the variations, and find the move that works, or resign.

As a mere mortal, you just have to mix it up with fairly random moves, until either it is simple enough and you can read out a way to win, or it has obviously failed. Still, when you are playing random moves, try to hit vital points.]

It is a normal follow-up after the 5-3 point.

With the weak white group on the side, you are probably more interested in centre strength than corner territory.]
