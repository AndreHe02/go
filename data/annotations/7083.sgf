;B[cp]C[RickMott: Hi, Paragoomba:

The biggest improvement you could make in your game would be to keep an eye on the whole-board strategic situation, and recognize which are the important areas.  You tend to make small local response moves which aren't critical and miss much bigger moves in more important areas.

My comments throughout are aimed less at tactical advice than at making you more aware of the big picture.  Just forcing yourself to look over the whole board every time, before making a local response, will improve your rating several stones in a hurry.  You should alway be thinking, "Do I really have to do this, or is there a bigger move elsewhere?"

Good luck!

    Rick Mott];W[pc];B[dc];W[pp];B[cj]C[RickMott: This move is a bit odd.  Normally, you wouldn't play a low (3rd line) stone; it makes your position in the lower left very flat.]
;W[eq];B[pj]C[RickMott: But once you've played C10, I think it is reasonable to tenuki (not respond to White's approach).  This says you want a fighting game.  There will be no huge moyos for either side.  That's probably OK, since you are playing low and your opponent is generally playing high.]
;W[mq];B[jq]C[RickMott: But this is too much.  You shouldn't invade everywhere.  White has a low position here, so this is not the most important area of the board.  Better to reinforce your isolated stone on the right with something like Q7 or R14, or take a big point on the top like K16.  You are just making another weak group with K3.]
;W[hq];B[jo];W[qe];B[qm];W[kc]C[RickMott: As a result, White gets a good extension for her E3 stone and a strong position in the upper right.  You didn't get much for the K3-K5 stones at all.  You would have been much better off to take a position in the top center instead of K3.  Even if White made some territory on the bottom, the position is low; you would have had a chance to make more profit in the upper left quadrant eventually.]
;B[hb]C[RickMott: Why 2nd line?  G17 would be the usual extension, and once you do that White would not waste another move in this area.  This weakens your extension for no good reason.]
;W[eo];B[dn];W[en];B[dm];W[ph];B[qi]C[RickMott: White made a mistake by approaching high at Q12.  You don't have to answer.  I think it would be better to make a move to solidify your upper left corner, at C15 or C14.  Probably C15, since your extension at the top isn't as strong as usual.  You would welcome a White invasion at C12 or C13; with strong positions on both sides, it would be a target for attack.

Whereas if White plays there now, you are behind in territory already.]
;W[qh]C[RickMott: But fortunately, she follows your lead and plays again here, giving herself an overconcentrated position.  Say thank you... :)]
;B[rj]C[RickMott:  If you want to expand your eye space, you should extend on the other side, maybe even slide all the way to S4.  But you don't have to; this position is strong enough.  You should play elsewhere, probably upper left.]
;W[cd]C[RickMott: Too bad; White wakes up first. :)]
(;B[de]C[RickMott:  You have to think about how you want this position to end up.  What is this moving doing for you?  It is hard to imagine you can capture White.  All you can do is decide whether (for example) you can force her to live small and build outside strength, or take territory and make her run out.

The larger strategic threat is White's moyo in the upper right.  You want to find a way to constrain that or reduce it.  The game will be won or lost over the final balance of territory between your left side and her upper right.

Since the left side is important, I would be inclined to pincer her stone at C13.  This move gives White too many good choices. What will you do if she simply pushes through and cuts?]
;W[ce];B[df];W[bg];B[cf];W[bf];B[dd];W[cc];B[cb]C[RickMott: Small move, only a few points.  Having built the outside wall, you have to use it to reduce White's upper right corner somehow.  Possibly a cap at L15 or a high cap at L14?  Your goal is not to make territory out of the wall, but to invade/reduce White.]
;W[bb];B[db];W[ac];B[ch]C[RickMott: Not important.  White should now expand her upper right moyo while neutralizing the influence of your wall.  L14 feels about right to me.]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[cg];B[dg];W[ae]C[RickMott: Fortunately, White also makes only local plays.  She backed herself into this corner by forcing you to complete your outside wall and taking away all her own outside liberties, and you wind up with sente.  Say thank you again. :)]
;B[di]C[RickMott:  Not necessary.  Both of you are missing the strategically critical boundary on the board, which is the balance between your wall and his upper-right moyo.  If White cuts with atari at D12, you are so strong on both sides that her cutting stones will just be targets for attack.  While attacking, you with either make territory or greatly reduce her upper right.  So you should not defend here, but play somewhere around L14.]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[dq]C[RickMott: Locally no good.  You give White a forcing move at D4..]
;W[dr]C[RickMott: ... which she misses.];B[ep];W[fp];B[dp];W[fr]
;B[do]C[RickMott: This move is also not needed.  Locally, it would be much better to play at E7 or F8 to start enlarging your moyo.  But in whole-board terms, it's still more important to play in the upper center.]
;W[fo];B[em];W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[gl]C[RickMott: Ok, you're building up your left-side moyo, but at the same time you're weakening the two stones at the bottom.]
;W[kh]C[RickMott: Alas, White gets to the critical area first.  If there's a single winning move, this may be it.]
;B[hm];W[gn];B[hn];W[ho];B[io]C[RickMott: Ok, you've saved your bottom stones and prevented a large-scale capture by White there, but you are still behind in the balance of territory.  If White plays steadily here, she will win easily.]
;W[ip];B[jp];W[mn];B[mm]C[RickMott: generally, it's not a good idea to play a contact move against a weak stone.  You just force White to strengthen her position.  You have two good choices.  One would be to slide at S4.  This would finish the bottom-right corner; both you and White would have easy life.  You could also attack the weak position directly with O4 or O5.  White can defend one weak connection or the other, but not both.]
;W[he]
(;B[ge]C[RickMott: White should not have ignored your contact play at the bottom.  Instead of responding here, you should try a clamp at N5.  White will have a hard time finding a good response.]
;W[hd]C[RickMott: If you follow White's lead as you did in the game, you cannot win.  The time has come for desperate measures.

Consider a deep invasion of White's moyo while it is still possible.
See variation.]
(;B[gd];W[hc];B[gc];W[ib];B[ga]C[RickMott:  This is a terrible result for you.  You have allowed White to compress your wall to nothing while making her own upper-right territory stronger and larger.]
;W[jc];B[hf];W[if];B[ie];W[je];B[id];W[ic];B[hg]C[RickMott:  Local tactics: atari at J13, then extend to J12.  Your territory is a line wider that way.]
;W[ig];B[ih];W[kk]C[RickMott: This feels like an overplay.  See variation.]

(;B[jh];W[jg];B[kg];W[jf]
(;B[hh]C[RickMott: Right idea, but protecting this cut is not necessary.  You should atari at L11 immediately.]
;W[lg]C[RickMott: White gives you the L11 atari anyway.  She should just extend to M12 and you would not be able to cut off L9.]
;B[ki];W[kf];B[lh]C[RickMott: But setting up a ko here doesn't do you any good.  You should also extend solidly at M11.]
;W[kg]C[RickMott: but White fills anyway, so no harm done.]
;B[li];W[mj];B[mi];W[km];B[ln];W[mo];B[lo];W[lp]
(;B[lm]C[RickMott: You don't need to connect here.  Extend to O7.  If white cuts, make a bamboo joint with K6.  See variation on previous move.]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[om]
(;B[ol]C[RickMott: You should not follow along meekly here.  You can't make any territory above these two stones.  You will do much better to reduce White by sliding to S4.  See variation.]
;W[pm];B[pl];W[qn];B[rm];W[rn];B[nn]C[RickMott: This can't work.  Save these moves for ko threats.  If you play them out now, you remove all the aji (potential) in the situation.]
