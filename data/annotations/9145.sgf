C[Hello, I'd like a review of this game. I'm 6k KGS. I play white.
I added some notes and questions, but you can review on other things I did wrong. I think my biggest mistakes were during the fuseki. Thank you!

(sorry if my english is bad, i'm french ^^)

Hello, I'm Clement, 1D on KGS and I will try to give you advice and point out your mistakes. Remember I'm only 1D so take my comments lightly as I'm not a pro.

And I'm French too, I'll do the review in English. You can ask me on KGS (cb22) if you want a talk about your game.]

(;W[dc]C[cb22 : this move is not bad but most of the time, you don't want to face black d4 stone for the developpement of your shimari. It's an easy target for black.

Just to know, I've only found 12 pro games on fuseki info with this opening (while there's 313 pro games possibilities the move before)]

(;B[kp]C[cb22 : high chinese fuseki. I don't see it often, most often players play the classic chinese fuseki with L3]
;W[op]C[cb22 : Bad approach. You're an easy target for black now. See variation.]

(;B[nq]C[I don't know this joseki so I think I didn't play well here.

;W[pj];B[le];W[mf];B[mh];W[rh]C[cb22 : very small and slow, you still have a shimari to play]

(;B[rg];W[mg]C[Icb22 : did you played this to protect you're 015 eye ?  it's a very slow at this stage of the game.]
;B[lh];W[ce]C[cb22 : at last :D];B[dj]C[cb22 : at this point of the game, white is very behind in term of points and influence...]
;W[hc]TR[lh][dj][dp][kp]C[cb22 : good developpement for your shimari but the triangle formation should be your first priority. You have to reduce your opponent moyo]
;B[mo];W[dn]C[cb22 : good, but maybe a 3rd line move wouls be better to invade]
;B[fo]
(;W[fn]C[cb22 : you should try to avoid contact with black stones as you will only help him settle his group and cristalize his territory. Plus the direction is wrong, you're not creating life space for you're group. I think you're trying to set a big attack on d10 but it will be very hard because it has a lot of space.]

[js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps]C[Conclusion :

Well, this game was most decided in the beginning. White started to invade (too early) the chinese fuseki of his opponent and black exploited the game and your few mistakes well. 

Try to choose the biggest points of development in the beginning and mostly, try to avoid small early moves in the beginning like second line moves. You're giving sente to your opponent for cheap !

remember those points before playing in the opening :

1) do I have weak group to settle / does my opponent has weak group to attack (urgent moves)
2) Is there big points left ? can I split my opponent stones and create a weak group ?
3) can i enlarge my moyo and reduce my opponent moyo ?
4) can I attack my opponent stones and developp mine

Remember also that most of times invasion is on 3rd line and reduce is on 4th line ! 

Have fun on your next games !])
