AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi there!

In this game, the black stones were mine, my KGS nick being “MrMiai”.

I’m about 9 kyu (KGS) at the moment, few online games so far, there will be one KGS game per week, and I will go through every game the day after. So far, I played all my KGS games rated, no-undo, in the slowest “automatch” mode, 25min plus five times 30sec (faster games feel just insane), accepting players up to 6 ranks “above” or “below”. Plus, there is one “real” game every week (1h+ each) with one fine gentleman who takes black or 2 stones against me.

When doing my own-game-reviews, I try to decide from every move whether it is appropriate, whether tenuki would have achieved more, how the board looks like now, and I try to see which situations came up that I can try to read like tsumego; sometimes I make a list of all my moves which I recognize as being useless. Below, I will try to “listen while speaking” instead, talking not too much. I want to get stronger in a slow, but sustainable way. Did I look at the right things/aspects and ask appropriate questions? Feel free to ignore my questions and answer to better ones that I did not ask.

Please help me to learn the lessons from my games better.

I'm looking forward to your review. If happen to write it in German - well, German is my mother tongue, I can read it better...

Next long commentary (and the last one in this file) at move 200.

REVIEWER: Pete 3k GLT

Hey Peter! Happy to review the game for you. Hope you find these comments useful. Let me know if you have any follow-up questions. In the review I marked my comments with 'R:  ...'

As far as general comment on style it seems that in this game black fell behind because:
1. black focused too much on capturing a single white stone some place 
2. black was too gentle with white - there were no big attacking moves that white cared about
3. the center was not used at all - it was sitting there without any attackig function until it was surrounded and attacked by white. Rember that stones placed on or above 4th line are not meant to make or take away territory. They are meant for fights. So you can't let it sit there till after the middle game.

Also, thank you for shareing all the information with regards to the books you have read. That is certainly great set of books! Unfortunately I cannot give you advice on which of these books might help you most (I would not want to take the liberty in directing your studies long-term). I recommend you conact a 3d or stronger player for a private lesosn on KGS some time. He/She might recommend long-term study strategy for you.]
;W[dd];B[jj]LB[pj:B][qj:A][jp:C][jq:D]C[Asking for trouble; I want to learn by trying something hard-to-achieve here. “Make this stone work against a player who is 3 stones stronger.”
Well, I know that, at my level, I lose my games by making more tactical blunders than in the last game, and win them by making less ones; but hues of strategy also begin to make their difficult-to-estimate impact on the results, I think. Still confusing how one should “look at the whole board” (I keep trying) without “seeing” concise sequences emerge there. Lost in space.


R: This move is not bad if you are hoping to develop a lot of influence in the center. But to do this you have to stick to that plan: develop influence and not territory on the 3rd line. If white invades your territory, let him and take the outside influence. Playing to develop invluence is not easy. Players that are much stronger than you and I will usually prefer influence over territory because they want to use it for advanced fighting. Once they kill something big they often win the game. 

The best moves are A-D here. The other sides are also possible but your stones work better when you create two extensions from your corners with one move. 

When you have a chance, check out book called Fundamental Principles of Go. It talks about the order of best moves (at least as far as theory goes). http://senseis.xmp.net/?FundamentalPrinciplesOfGo]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[jp];B[mq]LB[cq:A]C[To not let 5 feel too cosy. Missed all moments to isolate 5 later, though. Even helped W to connect.


R: Yes. This is a good move. If I were wite I would jump in at A sooner or later and take way base of the two black stones. So be careful about this.]
;W[pj]LB[pj:A][jp:B]C[R: notice that moves A and B by white will demolish any influence you were hoping to make with the stone in the center (they are on the 4th line). White will render that center move useless.]
;B[qg]LB[pc:B][ph:E][pl:D][qn:C][mq:A]C[Had only vague ideas there. I still do not find very concise ideas of which region to play in now, and why.


R: Sure, this move is good as well. It does two things (just like move at A):
1. weakens your opponent (less room for base)
2. prepares to enclose the coner with big territory (if black gets to play at B)

You also made a move that keeps your stones together (which is good in handicap games).

If I were white now, I would play at C next. If black gets to play around D, white will be in trouble and chances if going into the lower right corner will decrease. 

So all that is good style on black's part however there is something that doesn't fit here: white is not getting enough pressure applied to his stone. If black played at E, the white stone would be under a lot more pressure. Without pressure on white, white is allowed to roam around the board where he feels fit.]
;W[nc]LB[ne:C][pl:A][hp:B]C[R: white is playing very aggresively. In a 3-stone game that is not really necessary. I just came back from a workshop where the teacher (5p Chinese pro) kept telling us: when playing handicap games as White, play moves you would normally play. Sometimes it was very hard to believe her but it does make sense. White is very weak at the moment. Black could take opportunity to strike at any time. 

Good points for black to attack on would be A-C. Notice that those moves do not attach or kick white. Such moves would only make white stronger.]
;B[oc]C[R: This move will make white stronger. If you want to attack / separate the stones at A and B, you have to do it from further away. The teacher also told us: if you want to catch fish, don't do it with your hands, use a big net around the fish. Fish are too slippery to catch by hand :)]
;W[jc];B[nd]LB[nj:C][pj:A][pl:B]C[I was very satisfied.


R: Black might be happy about the local outcome (also attacking A will be easier if black plays at B next) but black also lost sente. 
If I were Black, I would play at B first and see what white does. If I were white I would not tenuki at that point and try to escape at C perhaps.]
;W[qo]LB[pl:A][mo:B][jp:C][qq:D]C[Hm. "Overplay"? Punishable in some way or other? But W is right, 'cause 13 makes me feel uneasy about my answer.


R: Yes, you could play at A to attack immediatelly. The two stones in the corner should be safe. Especially if you get a chance to play a move like B which escapes into the center while preparing attack on C. Yes, white could jump into the corner but if black ends up capturing the stone on the right-middle, that would be OK compensation. See next move variation.]
(;B[qp]LB[oo:B][po:A]C[Appropriate?

R: yes, this is good as well. It is a solid response. If white goes up to A, he will get hit on the "head of two stones" by black at B (which would be very very bad. The teacher at the workshop would say "game over for white!!". This is probably why white decided to play some place else for now.]
;W[bp];B[cq]LB[jp:A]C[R: Yes, need to protect. Get ready to attack A. You have to be strong in order to attack or else you will die.]
;W[dj];B[po]LB[pj:B][qo:A]C[In order to help 2.

R: this will help white. White is not that worried about the stone at A. It can die and that's OK. The corner belogs to black as of now anyway. So that stone at A doesn't really do white any purpose. White is going to be more worried about saving B. So what white does now is it sets up a bait....]
;W[qm]LB[qo:A]C[R: White is hoping that you try to capture the stone at A. See Variation on next move.]
(;B[rj]LB[nn:D][qo:A][hp:C][jp:B]SQ[ol][om][on][po][pp][mq]
C[ 
R: yes, it is a lot more important to take away the base than to capture A. As you attack the 3 stones, keep an eye on white stone at B. You should attack it at some point as well. Best way to do this might be to
1: build a wall along the marked points/stones, and then
2: attack at C

But if the stones on the right side end up escaping into the center at around D, the stone at B will have much easier time connecting to them.]
;W[ro]LB[jj:B][om:A][jp:D][rq:C]C[Better for B to try to help 2 now?
p7 (separating, attacking?)
e6 (same, hopefully?)
o13 (making points. But encouraging upper left W moyo?)
k15 (or how else?) to not let w get too much in the upper left quarter?

R: I think best move at this point is at A. It does help the stone at B a little bit and it also prepares that wall to attack white D. 
But the stone at B is not in trouble yet! It might be too early to think about saving it. You should think about using it first. Best way to us it is to attack white D.]
(;B[rp]LB[cc:A][cd:B][jp:C]C[R: this is an Ok move (makes white shape very bad but it is a bit slow. I think top left corner is more important right now. If white plays at A or B, it will have corner enclosure with two extensions along sides (difficult to deal with for black in handicap game like this). Black should also think about attacking white stone at C. Try to keep sente.]
;W[om]LB[jp:A]C[R: White is happy to do this because it helps the stone at A.]
;B[md]LB[nc:D][nd:C][je:G][fj:F][jj:A][jn:E][jp:B]C[Played to help 2, but I helped W instead.

R: Too slow and loses sente. Top left corner and attacking B are more important. As soon as black made move at C, white has probably decided that stone at D is not useful any more. So this move doesn't gain much for black. Stone at A does not need help yet. It shoudl be used to attack / reduce. You can play at E, F or G. Remember that you placed the stone at A so that you can have center influence. Influence should be used for fights! Stick to that plan or else the stone at A will become useless.]
;W[je]LB[cc:F][cf:E][jj:A][jn:B][ho:C][lo:D]C[Above the a1 - t19 diagonal the board begins to look unpleasant for B, who is also beginning to worry about 2.

R: you need to activate the stone at A. Use it, don't worry about saving it. I would play at B now. It would force white to respond (probably at C or D). You can also play at E still. Invasion at F also is possible (although it would make A less safe later on.]
;B[fc]LB[jc:B][je:C][cf:A][bi:E][dj:D]C[If I play like n13, I thought, and w plays moyo-builder in the upper left quarter, I’ve lost. Had no concise idea, though, of what to achieve in the upper left quarter, and how. Live somewhere new somehow, or connect to somewhere else. Prevent w points.

R: Yes, good idea to go into the corner. But why did you choose the side that has less room and more white stones? The white stones at B and C are very strong and rooted on 3rd line. You can't get through them or underneeth them. They are a big wall. Stone at D however is on 4th line and does not prevent you from making eye-making moves like E. So A is definitely better place to invade.]
(;W[ec]LB[dc:A]SQ[jc][jd][je]C[R: This is definitely the right way for white to play - try prevent black from going into the corner and force it to fight with the wall of marked stones. This will be very tough for black. I would actually play at A to make tripple-sure black does not jump into the corner (like you did).]
;B[cc]LB[ec:B][fc:A]C[R: Yes, good move I think. However, the exchange A-B was not useful to you. It woudl be better to jump into the corner without that exchange.]
(;W[fd]LB[dc:A][cd:B]C[R: If I were white, I would play at A or B instead. See variations.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[bd];W[bf];B[be];W[cg];B[df]C[R: yes, running to the center is more important than living small in the corner.]
;W[dg];B[ef];W[eg]
(;B[dc]LB[cc:A][dc:B][ec:C]C[Bah! Clumsy.

R: yes, every time two stones of yours (like A and B)  hit another stone (C), say to yourself: "game over". That's what the pro said to me like 10 times :)]
;W[eb];B[bb]LB[bb:B][ff:A]C[R: black could probably push out one more time at A. But play at B is also good - black is now alive there.]
;W[ac];B[db];W[gc];B[ab]C[R: not necessary, Try to read it out.]
;W[qh]
(;B[rg]C[R: too gentle on white!!!!]
(;W[lf]LB[ff:B][oh:D][fn:C][hq:A]C[R: I am not sure what is the purpose of this move by white. If I were white I would prefer to play at A, B, C or maybe D.]
;B[ph]LB[jj:A]C[R: black is focusing too much on small fish he can catch while the sharks are strating to circle around BIG center around A.]
;W[nf]C[Didn't like the look of the board now...

R: Yes, white sharks are swiming in a big circle around the center stone. At this point it will not have any attacking power. Too late.]
;B[pf]LB[pg:A];W[fn];B[mj]C[R: Yes, good way to try to connect.]
;W[oi]
(;B[qi]C[R: Not needed. See variation.];W[nq]LB[jj:C][mj:D]
[om:B][jp:A]C[R: white is just trying to make A and B more connected so that C and D can be attacked.]
;B[np];W[mp]
(;B[mo]LB[jp:B][mp:A]C[R: This is possibly the worse move black could make in this position. Black is pusing the stone at A towards its buddy at B. See variation.]
;W[lp];B[no];W[nr];B[pr];W[mm]LB[jp:A]C[Panic! Looking at this situation, a black loss of "only" 20.5 points looks quite acceptable to me. I did not resign, because I wanted to learn. (How would I, when being W, attack the b stones? No guess.)

R: yes, terrible result for black. The stone at A was so lonely and weak. It got so strong now and black center is in trouble.]
(;B[fg];W[ff];B[gf];W[fe];B[gg]C[R: This little group is too far from the other two stones. Now black has to worry about connecting two groups and making them live!]

(;B[im]LB[hq:A][iq:B]C[R: Yeah, this shape does not look very good. There might be better ways. See variations.

From here to 200: terrible, of course. Lack of practice and of knowledge make endgames hard to play for me. Have to do some homework. I find endgame extremely interesting, regrettably  I’m rather exhausted half of the times I reach one :-)

(;W[hd];B[ge];W[fa];B[hg]C[Thank you for having read thus far.

I chose one of the games I feel less comfortable when looking at them.

I felt that from now on, even the most proper moves could not save me. Kind of intestinal score estimation is the only one I do in my games; seems not extremely unrealistic most times, though. And as often as possible I “take a step back” and look whether I like what I see.

During the next time, I will do some homework on the days without a game/self-review. What I read so far: I did the Go Problems For Beginners Vol. 1 to 3, one halfth of Dickfeld’s “Leben und Tod” (carefully), some Cho Chikun beginners’ tsumego book with Korean text, Kageyamas “Lessons” (beautiful, though of difficult-to-estimate use at my level), Otake's Beginners' Fuseki book (do not remember a lot from it), “How Not to Play Go” by Yuan Zhou (very nice), and tried several books that were too hard. I have begun to work through Davies’ “Tesuji”, planning to do his “Endgame” next, then his “Life and Death”. Then perhaps a longish period of tsumego again: First part of Cho’s collection in the Internet.
Joseki patterns? Well, I was told that you need to be rather experienced to make use of them, to decide how to punish deviations for example, or how to recognize the patterns’ appliability in a given situation. Being curious, anyway.

Every 8 online handicap games that I played so far were won by white (I was White in a few of that games, too). Dunno wether this wants to tell me something?

Do you see one aspect of my play / my view on the game which is much poorer than the other aspects? Which change of my homework plan would you recommend? Which shift of my focus during the games?

I'm looking forward to your answers (again, feel free to ignore questions, I know I wrote a lot).

LB[bb:A]SQ[bf][cg][dg][eg][fg]C[R: At this point black should probably stop pushing white (since that gives the white marked wall a lot of strength). Black can make life at A like in the real game.]

C[R: Black is out and safe but was it worth it? White made a lot of territory on the left side. At some point black should have probably tried to make life in the corner. The only way black can be happy with this result is if black gets a chance to attack (and maybe kill) the group of stones on the top side (maybe start with move at A).]

LB[gh:A][ii:B]C[R: black also makes points. Move at A looks weird and too low now. This means that move at A was not efficient way to play. It would be better if A was at B. So in this sequence black made some white stone innefficient which is the goal. That's definitely a good way to think about it and I hear dan and pro players talk about stuff like this all the time.]
