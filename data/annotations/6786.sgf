C[Hello,

    I'm Andreas, probably about 10k, but a bit rusty atm. I try to give you some pointers.
    Feel free to email me at takiro@dragoncairn.net if you have any questions.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj]C[Well, this looks easy as opening. Keep in mind though, this opening has a framework kind of aproach.]
;W[dj]LB[jp:A][fq:B]TR[pd][pj][pp]C[You have 3 high stones now saying I don't care much for territory. Usually you follow up with bold mojo moves.

A is quite common.
B as well, just an approach move.];B[jq]C[I figured to extend my influence further towards white. This was the closest I felt confident about.

==================================

Right idea, but to low imho, considered your other stones. not a bad error at that level, (at mine prolly not as well)]
;W[jj]LB[jd:A]C[This move surprised me; I am not sure what white was planning with this one (I've never seen sanrensei followed by tengen, though I know that doesn't mean it's wrong).

=============================

Tengen is to early now IMHO.
I would answer with claiming the last big point on the upper side now at A.
The idea is quite simly to invite an invasion of white somewhere and make profit of it.]
;B[fq]LB[cc:1][jd:A][cg:2][cm:3][cq:4]C[Wanted to extend further in and threaten an invasion.

=============

Well you can always invade anywhere still and that move looks not forcing.
If I'm white I ignore and play A];W[jd]LB[gd:B][qf:D][cg:C]
[cn:A]C[This also surprised me, though I think he was planning a large moyo off of his four hoshi points.

======

Well, good move in my eyes. your F3 stone has still a weakness behind at h3 and looks all in all rather slow

 I'm not sure how to proceed now, hmmm. We probably have to invade somewhere and try to not help white building his mojo. Not sure if we can wait with something like D]

(;B[dq]C[Should this have been a direct invasion at C3?

==============

both are not that urgent and just help white maybe more then you. See variation before.

The white framework is on top, left and middle. He already didn't show much interest in defending that corner, by not responding to the f3 move.]
;W[qd]C[This is where the first major fight of the game occured, and I'm not sure about the entire exchange - I'm sure I made several tactical errors, since I lost the entire corner.

=====

You cannot protect the corner. (Well actually you can take it back and give white the outside, but that will be a disaster, given your opening) The goal is to give white as little of the corner as possible and take the side.]

(;B[qc]SQ[ne][oe][pe][qe][re][nf][of][pf][qf][rf]C[I did hane at tsuke - but should I have fought for the corner with this tsuke, or given it up in exchange for the side with R15?

======================

This is an error in strategic thinking. Why is the corner so important for you? In the opening, you put a stone at Q10 and neither Q4 nor Q16 show special interest in protecting the corners. So the gameplan would be to build your right side with R15 as you mentioned.


If the opponent invades in our mojo, the first question is how can we profit.
There are 2 usual games when you play a mojo game.

1. Use the invasion to build a wall.
2. Keep the invading group weak and make your framework into terretory by chasing it around.

At first glance on that invasion, I would like to build a wall marked with the squares.]

(;W[pc]C[Geez, really playing hard there.

Well, first instinct is to extend from the crosscut, but I'm not really sure about this.]

(;B[qe]C[Well, maybe is ok so close to the edge and corner, but remember. In a crosscutting situation, have a thought first if the extension works]
;W[rd]
(;B[re];W[pe];B[od];W[rc]
(;B[oe];W[pf]TR[qe][re]C[Prolly time to save the endagered cutting stones now]

(;B[rh]C[This move I am sure was a major tactical error, but I'm not sure what would be better.]
;W[rg]
(;B[ph]LB[qh:1][qi:2]C[kinda lots of holes here]
(;W[sf];B[pg]C[This move is really small.Would probably tenuki here.]
;W[se]C[Wasted move, there wasn't any threat yet.];B[oc];W[qb]
;B[pb]C[White can just ignore that .. only 1 point
Getting time to leave that be and take something else.]
(;W[qc];B[qh]LB[gc:B][gd:A]C[Probably should have defended my Q18 stone. via either P18 or P19.

==========================
No, the q18 stone isn't important at all. This is a little bigger but not much.
Tenuki and invade instead probably. A or B looks interesting to use your wall.]
;W[ob];B[nb];W[oa];B[na]C[I usually don't play first line moves that early ...]
;W[pa];B[mc]C[Is that really necessairy ? Maybe better to attack instead.]
;W[qp]C[well he had another try because it worked on the other side ?]
;B[qo];W[po]
(;B[rp];W[qq];B[ro]C[Problem with all this is now you lost the important cutting stone at q4. You secured around 18 points on the side, but your prospects on the lower side are decreasing.]
;W[op];B[or]C[Don't understand this move. A ladder breaker ? Maybe better at o3 then.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[pr]
(;B[ns]LB[mr:A]C[That move on the first line looks odd as well
Leaves always that A aji];W[np];B[mq];W[ps]C[Odd move and not forcing you to do anything else there. So time to tenuki.]

(;B[pm]LB[cc:E][gc:B][gd:A][cg:D][cn:C]TR[na][nb][oc][od][oe]
[of][pg][ph]C[Go upwards, but playing in this area looks quite passive. The P5 group is really solid so you cannot attack it and I don't see all that much territory in that n10 area left and white still has a big framework.

Your groups don't really look in danger so it is a good time to attack.

You as well have that big wall there that craves to be used.]

(;W[mo];B[lo];W[ln]
(;B[kn]C[It doesn#t look like we will make much territory here ... Maybe even leave m5 be in favour of an invasion. And this get's you into an akward fight.]

;W[io];B[ho];W[in];B[im];W[hn];B[hp]C[sigh, this whole procedure leaves a whole lot a cutting points. I just would like to end this fight and do something productive.

From a look at the board and a quick count I would say we are far behind, probably 50 points or more if we just close the borders now.

I don't see how we can catch up there with just reducing at A and B. So we really need to invade and live somewhere now to have the slightest chance.
 I'm not sure about where the best invasion point is, we waited quite long for this, maybe to long already.]
