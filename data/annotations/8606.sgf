AB[pd][dp]C[buckyyowza- comments by Mark Fyffe. Hope you enjoy my review!]
;W[oq];B[dd];W[gp];B[fo];W[li]C[Yeah I know. 

I make no apologies for my opening style. It's bizzare but there is a method to the madness.
-Xiangqi-

buckyyowza: this type of play shows an intention to fight - perfectly normal for white in a handicap game, and this is a fine reduction point. You are white today, so don't be concerned. However, be careful trying to play like this when you have the black stones; you will often be throw  stones away picking a fight with stronger player ;-)]
;B[po];W[rl]LB[pm:A]TR[li]C[buckyyowza: 2nd line play should be avoided. I suggest that play at Q7 now is best to take advantage of M11 for attacking Q5 in sente.]
;B[qq];W[qf]LB[lp:A][mp:B]C[buckyyowza: I really think white should respond here, rather than tenuki. The right side is taken already, so why approach this corner in this way now? I prefer M4 now to take more benefit on the lower side while continuing this corner with joseki play. N4 is also appropriate here.]
;B[qe];W[lc]LB[pf:A]C[buckyyowza: q14 is correct here - a little slow, but very solid and very large. Black's play ends in small gote, so there is little to worry about in this corner.]
;B[nc]
(;W[dg]LB[le:A]C[buckyyowza: Now the upper right corner is dominated by black - surely this is not the intent. Consider instead a one-space jump to M15.]
;B[pf];W[qg];B[pg]
(;W[ph];B[oh];W[pi];B[oi];W[oj]C[buckyyowza: hane here is too much - see var on 16. White cannot sustain this formation - better to play at R10 now and live lightly on the right side than to try to squeeze black out of a corner he is already in.]
;B[le];W[hd];B[gc];W[cb];B[db]C[ buckyyowza: b mistake - play C17 now.]
(;W[cd];B[cc];W[bc];B[dc];W[ce];B[bb];W[cm];B[cn];W[dn];B[co]
;W[dm];B[fp];W[ro];B[pq];W[ne]LB[nj:A][op:B]C[buckyyowza: black is stronger in this area, and white is already settled, so this stone doesn't accomplish much. Bigger, and more aggressive, options here are O10 and P4. O10 is an aggressive attack on the same stones as O15, but it also settles white's side group in sente. I prefer P4 here since it is both big in a disputed area and a continuation of local play in sente.]
;B[og];W[md];B[mg];W[hc];B[gd];W[mb];B[nb];W[mf];B[lf];W[lg]
;B[kg];W[lh];B[nf];W[me];B[jf];W[kd]LB[hf:A]SQ[hc][lc]C[buckyyowza: This is not necessary, since there is already a connection between the marked stones. It is better to push black into these stones rather than into the center. White's choice of fuseki shows fighting spirit and a preference toward a center game. This play settles established groups in gote while strengthing black in the center. A one-space jump to H14 here is better.]
;B[je];W[hg]LB[hf:A][ih:B]C[buckyyowza: two spaces is too far - H14 is the right play for white in this area. J12 is also an option to enclose black from the other direction.]
;B[he];W[ge];B[fe];W[gf]C[buckyyowza: white can say "thank you" to black for this assistance :-)]
;B[kh]
(;W[ii];B[ki]TR[gp][oq]SQ[lg][lh][li]C[I decided to give up the m13 cutting stones in return for a lagre area on the left. 

This was one of the decisions in this game that I was a little conflicted about. I couldn't read out a way to kill black and I didnt want this fight spilling out into my potential territory.

Was this the right way?
-Xiangqi-

buckyyowza: white cannot fight here, because of weakness in the marked stones. Had J11 been at K10, this black group could be contained in sente, but still not killed - see var on 64. I would focus on the bottom side of the board at this time: white's marked aji can easily turn into big profit for black if opening play remains unfinished there.]
;W[jk];B[kk];W[gm];B[lj];W[gq]C[buckyyowza: good - I am in favor of this line of play.]
;B[ff];W[fg];B[fm];W[fl];B[el];W[em];B[fn];W[ek]LB[gl:A]C[buckyyowza: white is fine on the left here, but needs G8 to follow up on the lower side and enclose black's corner group.]
;B[gl];W[fk];B[gn];W[hm]LB[kp:A]C[buckyyowza: why not play L4 and give black the two points for this stone if he wants them? Always be sure that your play will improve your score in addition to being a way out of atari.]
;B[hn];W[im];B[op]
(;W[dr];B[fq];W[fr];B[hr];W[gr];B[iq]C[buckyyowza: good for black, compare to]
;W[kq]LB[lp:A]SQ[hn][op]C[I think this was a big mistake.  Looking at it now I would prefer c3.  

-Xiangqi-

buckyyowza: I put the mistake at #86 - see var. C3 is good here. Consider that the influence of the marked black stones is very strong, and white has already been shut out of most of the lower side. A play at M4 might be a good choice in this light.]
;B[io];W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[cq];W[cr]C[seems like too little too late. After my opponent's nice move I couldn't make this live.  was there a way?
-Xiangqi];B[ar];W[dq];B[bq];W[eq];B[es]
(;W[mn];B[gs];W[sq]LB[pm:A]C[my opponent keeps killing my dead group so i decided to try and take away some of her points pressuring the lower right. this move seems like it reduced but at the same time sort of helped her make shape. 
what else can I try in that local area?
-Xiangqi-

buckyyowza: I wouldn't have given up the dead group so easy - see var on 105. Locally, T3 is good, but the game is not quite far enough along yet for this type of play. Something more like Q7 will get bigger points in sente while forcing black to settle in gote.]
;B[rq];W[rp];B[sr];W[sp];B[rs];W[pr]C[buckyyowza: definitely should be at Q7 now.  white is not stong enough in this area to pressure black's corner.]
;B[qr];W[od];B[oc];W[pc];B[pb];W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[pe];W[re]
(;B[rc]C[buckyyowza: considering black can play S14 and Q10 now, white is very lucky.]
;W[rd];B[mi];W[rb];B[ra];W[sc];B[oa];W[qa];B[jd];W[jc];B[hb]
;W[ib];B[ic]TR[oa][ra][nb][pb][qb][nc][oc]C[oops.  I missed my opponent's eye-making resource.
Should have let these stone go and played something like L18 I think.

buckyyowza: correct, black has lost track of the fight here. White should kill the marked group now - N17 looks the most direct. Don't be distracted by J17, it is in atari so K18 is not a real threat]
;W[id];B[ie];W[ic];B[oe]C[Nice.];W[nd];B[mc];W[ld];B[lb];W[kb]
;B[ma];W[gb];B[fb];W[ha]C[And black gets sente too and finds a big fat move.]
;B[bd];W[be];B[ac];W[pm]C[buckyyowza: A very sensible choice :-)]

;B[bn]
(;W[bk]C[buckyyowza: No danger here, so this is overplay. see var]
;B[ae]C[buckyyowza: so both players agree this is the endgame. As white, I want to play E4 now to keep the fight going - be sure to see this type of aji in developing your fighting spirit (see var). Nonetheless, the game is close but white should have no trouble winning by 5 or more so endgame play is important.

White should play B13 here.]
(;W[bf];B[af];W[ag];B[ad];W[bg];B[eg];W[ef];B[hf];W[gg];B[ee]
(;W[eh]LB[df:A]C[buckyyowza: no danger here. D14 is 2 points better.]

C[buckyyowza: this would have worked better before K7, but still a good play. Try not to get distracted, though. Now A8 is 2 points double-gote - good for black. It is often best to finish what you start before trying something exciting.]

Good game by my opponent staying cool in the heat of battle and taking advantage of my mistakes.

Thanks for the review.  Your comments will be well-received.
-Xiangqi-

buckyyowza: Thanks for the opportunity to review this exciting game! There is a lot to think about here :-) I'd suggest you study some advanced tesuji problems to take your fighting game to the next level. Your desire for a dynamic middle game can be a lot of fun once you start to think bigger. Stick with that and keep your eyes open for cutting points, and you'll find yourself in some very exciting situations.  I hope you enjoyed reading through my comments and find them to be of use!  Best wishes - Mark]
