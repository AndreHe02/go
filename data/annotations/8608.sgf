AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[gingo: Hi, i have played this match only few days ago and I lost it.
I'm not really a good player in handicap game so i hope i'll be able to improve with this review.

I'd like a review focus on white side but if you see something about black comments is welcome :)

df:  HI, I'm David Fotland and I'll be doing your review.  When you are white in a handicap game, black starts out with thickness, so it is important to build up some thickness yourself.  If you leave weak groups, black can use his thickness to attack you. Once you have some thickness, you can invade and attack black. In this game you made several long, thin extensions and never had any strong positions of your own.]
;W[nc];B[qf]C[Taoist [7k\]: hi
Taoist [7k\]: gg];W[fc];B[lc]C[gingo: I tryed to be light but he choose to pince

df: your move is reasonable in a handicap game];W[jc];B[le]
(;W[df]C[gingo: link with m18 was better? or anything else?

df: jumping into the upper right 3-3 point is pretty urgent. Since he played close to the corner on both sides, if you take the corner he will be very overconcentrated]
;B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[ec];B[dc]C[gingo: now i wanted push and extentend but i lost sente and I'm not sure its a good way to play

df: you often see white push and cut in this kind of position. It's an overplay, but white often wins the fight that follows.]
(;W[ce]
(;B[cd]C[df: I don't like this black move.  Better to connect out, then pincer.]
;W[cj];B[cn];W[ff]C[gingo: i tryed to attack for made point but i think its not the good way...

df: this move is not good.  G15 is a key point for both sides. It is sente for both.  You force black to play a point he really wants to play anyway.  Your move 17 gains you very little in exchange.  If you want to attack a group, don't play in contact with it.  Contact moves are for defense, because they strengthen the opponent, and leave your own stone short of liberties.  The lower side and the upper right coner are the biggest areas.  Your groups are both stable, so you don't need a local move. Black is too strong to attack since he has a base in the corner and can easily get out into the center.]
;B[ge];W[hd];B[de];W[cf];B[gf];W[qn]C[df: consider playing on the lower side since it is wider.]
;B[qp]
(;W[on]C[gingo: better o3?

df: anything is better :)  Jumping out like this is for running away when you can't make a base.  I would play R9, since it has a nice follow up at r12.]
;B[ql];W[np]C[df: this move doesn't attack strongly since he can easily connect at S6.]
(;B[oq]C[df: this move is too tight.  O3 is better.];W[nq];B[or]
;W[fp]C[df: this is too far to extend, and it doesn't attack the corner very well.  K4 is much better, since it has a nice follow up move at f3.]
;B[jp]C[gingo: here i had to do something to fight but i don't know what :)]
;W[pk]C[df: this is reasonable.  If you can build up some thickness here you can attack the K4 stone.]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[qk];W[pj];B[qj];W[pi];B[qi];W[pm]C[df: big, but too slow.]
;B[mr]
(;W[io]C[gingo: this its bad black can link and I dont make points

df: yes, there are no points in the center, and black can connect, so you get nothing.]

;W[ja];B[la];W[oc]C[gingo: i dont' know where i could make points now...is it already over?

df: black still has most of his original advantage.  He is ahead on territory and has no weak groups to attack.  It will be very hard to catch up now, but not impossible if he cooperates.  Look at the variation on move 75 for a continuation where black cooperates and lets you catch up.]
;B[na]
(;W[pe]C[df:these moves just strengthen black and leave your two stones in danger thenmselves.  Better to try to trick him from the other side.  If you want to cut see the second variation.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[pg]C[df: black's last two moves mad him much stronger.  You can't threaten to cut him the right side for example.  YOu stones add nothing to your position.  So the last two moves are a big loss.]
;W[ng]C[gingo: i tryed to attack m15 and m12 but with bad result

df: black can just play p15 to capture the two stones you just played.]
;B[nh];W[mg];B[je]C[df: ignoring this peep is dangerous.  your group to the right doesn't have eyes yet.  There is no reason to ignore it.  If black connects you just have a bigger target (see variation). Capturing one stone at m15 is way too small a target.]
(;W[ke];B[jd]C[df: once black cuts here white is very weak, and the game is over.]

;W[ni];B[oh];W[hg]C[df: this looks like you have a death wish.  First you invited the cut at k16.  Now you ask him to fill all of your outside liberties at the top.  Your upper right group is not alive yet.]

C[gingo: is better threaten to cut to try to make points in h7?

df: black is connected, so he is strong.  Your right side can be cut, and neither the top or bottom have two eyes.  Your only hope to win theis game was to make some points in the center. You chased black through yout potential territory and left yourself really weak, so now it is too late.]

(;B[jl]C[df: black shold make the snap-back rather than connecting, to get sente.]
;W[ko]C[df: black is alive above and below, so this move doesn't do anything. It still looks like white will die in the upper right.]
