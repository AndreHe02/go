;B[pd];W[qp];B[dp];W[dd];B[mc];W[oq]C[While this combination of two stones, P3 and R4, make a nice shimari (corner formation), the move is too slow for so early in the game. It would be better to attack one of Black's corners, either at R14, say, or on either side of the D4 stone. If you want to make another "constructive", a move near an edge star point, like Q10, might be good, or a move on the upper side.]
;B[fc]
(;W[df]C[This should probably be on the other side of the F17 stone, maybe at J16. The play of D14 is too passive, and allows Black to lay claim to the entire upper side. Some possible continuations are attached.]
;B[jd];W[di]C[Once again, too slow. This move could be one further, at the star point, or better yet, at C6 or something.]
;B[qn]C[Me. I would never approach a strong stone like R4 so closely. Black shouldn't get away with what he does.]
;W[ql];B[on]
(;W[ol]C[White probably doesn't need this move. If Black tries to bully the R8 atone, just run along the side. Some possible responses are attached. A better use of this move would be to play K3 or K4. Black has approached one side of your shimari; punish him by extending the other side.]
;B[mp]C[This is terrible. Black is just asking you to cut between these stones, giving him two weak groups. He would be better off playing O4, which has the intended effect of preventing you from stretching down the side, and helps his P6 stones to run.]
;W[no]C[This is the correct move. Black should not be able to connect up now.]
;B[np];W[nn]C[Don't switch horses midstream! Your aim with the O5 play was to cut Black off, now finish the job. The right move is P4. This gives your corner group wonderful shape, and the O5 stone is still okay. If he cuts it off with P5, run toward the center. Black's P6 group will have major problems staying alive, and you can make profit by chasing him.]
;B[op];W[pp];B[oo];W[nm]C[The O5-O6 stones weren't really in danger. It might be better to play along the right hand side, as Black does next move. If your intent is to try to kill the six Black stones in the lower right, then this move is okay, but follow through on your intentions in that case.]
;B[qh]C[Another thing to notice about Black's move is how well it fits with his stones at K16, N17, and Q16. The four of them make a big arc threatening to enclose the entire upper right quadrant. I don't know how to deal with this situation, "better not to let it happen at all".]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[er]C[The more usual continuation is White F4, Black D6, White K4. This fits in with your earlier play of denying the P6 group eye-space. The goal of an approach move like F4 is not really to take away the corner, but to threaten to do so, and when Black defends against it, to gain territory and influence on the side.]
;B[iq];W[dq];B[ep];W[cq];B[cp];W[bq]C[Better would be B4, which doesn't give up the initiative so much.]
;B[cl];W[dk]C[This move is ineffective, as you saw when you had to play C9 next move. Black isn't threatening anything very big; it would be better to play elsewhere and start something of your own.]
;B[dn];W[ck];B[dc];W[cc];B[ed];W[ce];B[ee];W[ef];B[ge]
(;W[rc]C[As corner invasions go, this one is substandard. Even if you live with it, you wind up having taken away less from Black that with the alternatives. For example, the R17 continuation is shown. For some reason, S15 is okay in some situations, but S17 never is.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[pb];W[sb];B[rd];W[pa]C[Too greedy. After Black's move, you only have one way to make two eyes in here, by playing S19 immediately. So you better do it.]

;W[hr];B[nq];W[or];B[oh];W[lh]C[This is an okay try, but more effort needs to be made in bringing it home.]
;B[li];W[mi];B[mh];W[kh]C[This needs to be the atari at L11. Once Black has a chance to support the M11 stone, there will be no way to get enough momentum to pull M12 out.]

;B[nh]C[Black covers the other entrance to his castle. But even if White gets to play O12, the response only goes as far as O12-N13-O13-O14-P11-P13-O11.]
;W[kg]C[This is a wasted move.];B[qi];W[rj]C[White needs to begin to worry about eye-space in this area. I comes as a surprise to the reviewer, but it may be that K10 is a safer move in that respect.]
;B[pj];W[qj];B[mk];W[oj];B[oi];W[nj]C[This is apparently the wrong move. Black's probe at Q9 is very strong, and should be prevented. The eye-space problem still hasn't gone away.]
;B[pk]
(;W[ok]C[Given the options, this is the best move. At first glance, I thought it was a blunder, and that Q8 would save the O-line stones. But the variation shows that in that case, White runs out of room, and the whole thing dies.]
