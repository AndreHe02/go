(;B[cj]LB[ar:a][bs:b][fo:c]C[Is this the wrong direction?  Do I need to play in the lower
right first?
HK: Black should move at a(A2) instead of this C10.  If white respond at b, black's c can block white's progress into the center.  Refer to the variation.]
;W[nq]
(;B[lq]LB[or:a]C[HK: Don't move from a strong stones.  a(P2) is recommended .  See the variation.]

(;W[no]C[HK: White should move at R3 instead of this O5, because black's lower center group is strong.  Refer to the variation.]
;B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[ln];B[ko]LB[in:a]C[This seems like a reasonable result for B. Is it?
HK: Very submissive move.  Black should progress to the center with a(J6).]

LB[nk:a][oj:b]C[This doesn't get a response from W.  Is it incorrect?
HK: Black should progress into the center with a(O9) or b(P10).]

(;W[lk]C[HK: White should move at O9.  Refer to the variation.]
;B[oj]C[This area didn't work out for B.  Is this a bad move?  What would
be better.];W[pk];B[ok];W[pi]
(;B[jk]LB[pl:a]C[HK: K9 is not an urgent point now.  And don't run after the weak white group.  Refer to the variation.]
;W[li];B[oi];W[pg]C[HK: Q12 is better than this Q13.];B[nc]
LB[oh:a]C[Does B need to defend around Q8 first?
HK: a(P12) is a very important point to aim at white's weak group.  And O17 is not a good move.  If black wants to reduce white's right side territory, he should enter at R17.]
;W[ld]
(;B[ne]LB[oh:a]C[HK: a(P12) is a vital point even now.  Refer to the variation.]
;W[ng]
(;B[pb]C[HK: Maybe P17 is better than Q18.  Let's try a variation.]

(;W[id]LB[mc:a]C[HK: White should move at a(N17) instead of J16.  Refer to the variation.]

(;B[lb]C[Would R17 be better?  Or something around N14?
HK: R16 is better.  Let's try a variation.];W[cf]C[HK: Now Q8 is very important point.  Refer to the variation.]

(;B[ej]LB[ar:a]C[HK: Black should move at a(A2) before this E10.  And C12 instead of E10.]
;W[fd]C[HK: E17 is better.]
(;B[db]LB[pl:a]C[Reasonable invasion?  Necessary?
HK: Even now a(Q8) is very important.  White's upper left corner needs one more protecting move.  So let's try a variation.]
;W[bc]C[HK: White should move at D17.  Then black could not easily get life there.]
;B[cc];W[cd]C[HK: White should move at B16 instead of C16.  Black got a lot of gain here.]
;B[bb];W[dc];B[cb];W[eb];B[bd];W[be];B[ac];W[qn]C[HK: Maybe an unreasonable move.  I think R7 is better.]

(;B[pl]C[HK: Black should move at R7.  Black's R7 would lead him to win.  Refer to the variation.
