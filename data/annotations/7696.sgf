C[Hi, I'm reviewing this game for White - I'll mark comments with CJT.

First off, there were many mistakes made in this game - but you managed to make more use of your opponents mistakes and come out with a large advantage.

For this reason though, I'm not able to go into each bad move in detail - but where I see general trends or areas to improve I'll try to point them out.


My general points of advice:
- Use thickness!  You built up a huge wall early on, which only became useful when black unwittingly got tangled up in a fight there.  You should try to find any opportunity to push your opponent towards your thickness.
- Remember the whole board!  Don't get drawn into endgame fights before the opening is halfway through!]
;B[oc];W[cd];B[eq];W[pp];B[co];W[ec];B[qq];W[qp];B[rp]LB[pq:a]
C[[CJT\] - well this is not the usual move - A is more common.  However the 3-3- invasion is not the best idea with such an open board and the top corner wide open...]
;W[ro];B[sp]
(;W[so]LB[pq:a][qd:b]C[[CJT\] - I think A is more severe - see variation for worst case for W...

Otherwise the open top corner looks very inviting... Around B is very big.]
;B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[op];B[nr];W[mr]LB[mq:a]C[[CJT\] - This move seems odd - you should be quite happy to see black crawl along the second line - building great outer influence as you go.  A seems more natural.]
;B[rq];W[nq]C[[CJT\] - Now stones 18 and 20 are just doing roughly the same job as the single stone left of 20 would be.]
;B[pr];W[mq];B[ms];W[ls];B[ns];W[lr];B[rs]C[[CJT\] - A totally unnecessary move from your opponent.  You have used maybe 2 stones more than you needed to here - but your opponent has wasted even more.

Now with sente I would go for attacking the top corner - using your thick wall below.]
;W[jd]LB[cj:a][dj:b][qd:c][qg:d]C[[CJT\] - If you want to play an extension - then you usually play the other side of a 3-4/5-3 corner enclosure - A or B are bigger.

However I think the most urgent move is around either C or D.

C prevents black getting the corner, while D also attacks the corner while threatening to make a large moyo on the right-hand-side.]
;B[qd]LB[ph:a][dj:b]C[[CJT\] - Now black is able to secure the corner - the most vital point is in front of the enclosures - first around A, then around B.]
;W[lc]C[[CJT\] - This is not a bad move - it settles some of the top terr]
;B[md];W[ld];B[mc];W[mb];B[nb];W[ma];B[lb];W[kb];B[na];W[la]
LB[dj:a][qh:b]C[[CJT\] - Looking at the board here it is quite clear that both players have been playing too small.  Usually the 1st line (round the edge) is reserved for end-game plays.  However here we have 8 stones on the 1st line, with two sides completely untouched.

It is obviously inportant not to let your opponent steal territory from you in the opening, but you must also consider whether there are more important places to play.

For example your last move saved your 2 stones being captured - locally this is the best move, but you could have taken sente to play A or B, then if black captures your stones, you can have a second move in sente... Worth the trade???]
;B[iq];W[dj]C[[CJT\] - Good move! (Fort!)];B[dl];W[ch];B[mf]
;W[lf];B[le];W[ke];B[me];W[lg];B[mg];W[lh]LB[pi:a][qi:b]C[[CJT\] - This move looks good too - you have a good opportunity to attack the lower part of the black corner, since you are so strong below.  Moves around A or B are still possible later.]
;B[fj];W[fh];B[ej];W[di];B[ei];W[eh]C[[CJT\] -  Solid - keeping yourself a very large corner.]
;B[dk];W[ck]C[[CJT\] - As I've said before, there are bigger moves on the board in the wide open spaces on the right...]
;B[cl];W[bk];B[bl];W[mh]C[[CJT\] - Good - a very strong 'turn' here - almost always the right move, hemming black in, and exerting more influence on the centre.]
;B[gh];W[gg];B[hh];W[hg];B[ig];W[if];B[jg];W[kf]LB[jf:a]C[[CJT\] - Better at A - black cannot cut...]
;B[jf];W[je];B[hf]
(;W[he]C[[CJT\] - Not the best move here I don't think - see variation.]

;B[ca];W[bf];B[ad];W[da];B[aa];W[ab]C[[CJT\] - Well done to kill black here... Often these are easy if you've studied hundreds of life-or-death problems, or have loads of time to work it out - but to do this on instinct is very good.]
