C[> Hi I'm Huginmunin 5k on kgs, I'll be doing your review. After quickly browsing though your game I think it will be most usefull if I go over the opening stages of this game. Also, I know the review is requested by white, but much of the review will be for black, since white won by a decent margin, it is only natural. I hope you find it helpfull. Feel free to contact me on kgs.
I'll precede my comments with >


yoby [15k\]: buen juego
Soujiro1 [9k\]: gracias, igual];B[pc]LB[qd:A]C[> Only the first move and already a mistake. Etiquette states that you should choose the location most to the right. So A is the polite place :)]
;W[dq]LB[pq:A]C[> Here are some variations on black's 2nd move, A was played but is not best.]

(;B[pq]LB[dd:A][pp:B][qp:C]C[> Playing two opposing 3-4 points is not very common, especially if white plays where he played
A, B or C are usually more in check with correct positional judgement.]
;W[dd];B[qe]CR[jc]C[> Here white should first play the big point, in the area of K17. Letting black play there would be too much for white. You do not have to play at the mark, if you think it is to close to the black corner, but you should aim for that direction.]

(;W[qo]LB[np:A][pl:B]C[> Here instead of jumping out, you may also want to try a pincer attack on the white stone. Especially since it works together with your enclosure at the top right.]

(;B[np]LB[qq:A][pl:B][ql:C]C[> White B or C are correct, White at A is slow. The reasoning for this is: If white plays at B or C, black would never play at A himself, at least not now.]

(;W[qq]C[> This move is way too slow and black can even ignore it]
;B[qr];W[rq];B[pr];W[ql]LB[qi:A][jq:B]C[> White is low and overconcentrated here, but stable, so black should not attack it at A, making himself flat. Also black still has the Q3 group to worry about, it is not yet stable and by not playing around B, black risks getting a running group or an overconcentrated one]

(;B[qi]LB[oo:A][hc:B]C[> The white group at the left is not in danger, so first play big points. Letting black play an extension from his top right corner now would be too much for white. So this should be first on white's list. B seems good enough.]

(;W[oo]
(;B[no];W[mc]C[> This white is to close to black's strength.]
;B[jc]C[> Black punishes white.

(;W[in]MA[ld][mc]LB[nm:A][je:B][ne:C]C[> Two stones are much weakened, now is the time to attack them. Playing at A doesn't do much and white can ignore it. Playing at B or C are much more severe.]
