C[Hello, this is a game I played on kgs, not a blitz. I'm 9k.  I play white, and I won, but it is a surprise to me. I'd like you to help me understand why ;-)

I will make attach a  comment  to each move I want to discuss about, but feel free to comment anywhere else ;-)

B: Hi! this is Biondy. 1k in KGS. I'll do the review. I'll start my comment with B


Thank you for your review.];B[pd]C[molokoi [9k\]: hello.];W[pp]
;B[cd];W[dp];B[id];W[jp];B[qn];W[ql]C[is this short pincer good ?

B: yes.];B[on];W[np];B[rp]LB[pk:A][qq:B]C[B: Black move is not recommended here, since after white sansan enclosure, black doesn't have a good follow up. 'A' or 'B' is better here.]
;W[qq];B[rq]MA[ql]C[B: too slow. Better to attack white's stone]
;W[qi]C[B: Good!];B[oq]C[oh oh, I dont know such a joseki ... would you look at the sequence and explain me if black could get more advantage here please.]
;W[po];B[pn];W[qr]
(;B[rr]C[B: too slow. Better to play 
R 13 here];W[nq];B[qp];W[or]C[this insteade of q3 to take off any aji to black stone.]
;B[qo]C[B: another slow move from black];W[dj]C[B: White is faster in development]
;B[dg]C[Is this a good black answer ? no better move  at that time ?

B: this move is OK. black wanted to use the power of High-Chinese formation]
;W[qf]MA[qi][ql]LB[cj:D][mm:C][mn:A][nn:B]C[Isn't white out of direction ? I'd better play ABC, wouldnt I ? Or else where ? 'D' seems too slow ?

B: 'A' is OK. I don't recommend 'B' and 'C', since it left a cut. 'D' is too slow.

This move is OK, since white's two stones will be under pressure if black played R13]
;B[pf]C[another joseki I dont know. What to answer ?

B: black tried to create a wall here. Your answer is actually a joseki too. Perhaps you can try Q13]
(;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[pg];W[qg]
(;B[qb]C[Ok, perhaps black's wall is a good gain in regard to white territory ?

B: yup. it's a fair exchange, but black's move is too slow. he can tried to create the moyo, or approach white]
;W[kd]
(;B[ld]C[I'd say black move isn't the better place to play:

wrong direction

strengtens white.

what do you say ?

B: agree. never attach when you're in the attacking side.];W[ke]

(;W[ie]C[B: how about M14?];B[he];W[if];B[hf]C[white is already capturable, but we both  will notice that very later.]
;W[jn]MA[ki][lh][kg][ke][kd][jd][jc][ie][if]C[I finally end with playing for my moyo !!!

B: yes. this is a good move. it also helped your group above]

B: yes.];B[dq]

;B[di]C[My so beloved moyo has vanished now ... what better direction for sequence ?

B: it's ok. now you get a strong formation for a middle moyo]

;B[bi];W[ij];B[pl];W[qk];B[ol];W[rm];B[rn];W[mn]C[at last !!!]
;B[kf]C[ok, white looses the stones .... /o\\];W[mk]C[never mind, this move is far more points, isn't it ?]
;B[ig]C[why loosing time to capture ?

B: ooh... what happen here?? where did white play?];W[mg];B[lf]
;W[ng]
(;B[jf]TR[mg][ng]C[what about those stones ? what importance ? nothing ?

B: black move is too slow..
 the two stones can't be captured directly];W[ne];B[nd];W[rb]

Thank you for your review.

B:Black forget to capture..
   Anyway, I think you play far better than black here. Black's play is too slow. Keep up the good job
