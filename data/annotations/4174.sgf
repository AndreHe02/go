paul:  There's nothing wrong with this move at all.  Your opponent has a huge array of choices (in terms of joseki), but it generally works well with your d4 stone -- in my opinion, but I'm hardly a fuseki expert.  The thing to realize here though is that starting with this diagonal setup means you're in for a heavy fighting game.  Some players desire this.  

I have thrown in a few typical joseki choices.  In all of them, white touches black at p3.  White is under no obligation to do this however.]

(;W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[nr]C[Note that this isn't really one of the joseki choices I threw in. :)]
;W[qm];B[qj]TR[nr][nq][op]LB[jq:A][jp:B][np:C]SQ[qg]C[This move isn't helping as much as it could either.  It doesn't build very much because white can attack both sides at the same time by playing r13 (or something similar).  Also, your marked stones are pretending to be a wall, but they don't face anything very effectively.  It's almost required to point your influence at something here (in my opinoin anyway).  Choose A or B to get your thickness pointed at something.

However, the real problem with this formation so far is the cutting point at C.  White should have cut there right away.]

Paul: Yeah, it didn't turn out too badly.  The pincer was a smart choice there.]
;W[cg];B[dr]C[Isn't it to small ?. My idea was to chase white group so i decided to reduce his space for eyes

paul: no, it isn't too small... it's a fine strategy.  However, make sure you get something out of the chase!  Also, make sure the attacks actually work so you can leave the chase with sente.]

;W[im];B[he];W[gc];B[ib]LB[fe:A]TR[nc][md][qe][pg][oj]C[Should I play A instead ?, or maybe somewhere else ?

paul: j18 doesn't seem to do much.  Especially because white can easilly play behind your iron pillar.  I think A does almost nothing.  The white stones are strong.  Grab territory instead.  I marked some territory grabbing moves.  There are plenty of other choices too.]

;W[gi];B[hi];W[em];B[el];W[fm];B[gl];W[gm];B[qc]C[I have decieded to defend my moyo

paul: Not a bad plan at all. White should have tried that a while ago.  I'm not entirely sure, but I don't think that white group in the lower left has any eyes.  You can probably pick on it for a while (in sente) yet before you need to do something defensive.  However, that moyo looks pretty juicy.  And there are still a dozen ways to get in there.  The ideal way to defend this huge moyo is like in the edit below.  

It takes more moves, but this formation still has room for invasions (around r13 for example).]

(;B[hk]C[paul: I saw your comment at the end of the game, and if big moyo is what you're looking for, make it now.  that cut was a little agressive, chase him back into it and build up your thickness instead... (variation)]

(;B[ji];W[jh];B[ig];W[ih];B[jg];W[kh];B[lj];W[mh]C[its getting a bit worse ..., i guess this moyo is too big


paul: also, it might have helped to back up.  Playing too close is the real problem here.  Also, the peep at j13 didn't help you in your goal of defending the giant moyo.  It might have been best to push him up toward your iron piller and just sacrificed a few stones... (see the variations back at move 66 for my ideas....)]

I'm looking forward to your suggestions


paul: well, big moyos are hard.   You need to have enough stones in there to defend them and when your opponent starts to get too close to the edges, you'd need to defend them.  Sometimes defending a huge moyo is more expensive than you'd think it should be.  Then again, keeping a huge moyo can sometimes be worth 50 points.  It all depends.]
