C[enjolras [13k\]: hi
enjolras [13k\]: have a nice game
JofSpades [9k\]: hello gg
enjolras [13k\]: because league game i giving it 200 percent

GB> Hello. I am Geza Bohus and reviewing this game. I will
preced my comments with "GB>"

You have started the game very well and should not have
given up so soon, you still had a good chance winning.

You were not so great in local fights, perhaps you could
practice that. I can think of two ways of doing that:
playing 9x9 games and doing problems, for instance
take a look at goproblems.com.

Please let me know if you have further questions. You
can reach me at gbohus@yahoo.com.];B[pd];W[dp]C[JofSpades [9k\]: good]

;B[pk]C[JofSpades [9k\]: thats awesome];W[qo];B[pn]C[enjolras [13k\]: indeed]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[pj]C[GB> This is the first mistake that I noticed. It is usually not a good idea not to connect when the opponent peaks, ie. R13 is better. Luckily your opponent did you some favors 8-). Also, "bumping your head" into a stone is not so great either. There was no problem around Q10.]

GB> Big favor from your opponent. He should have closed at P15 and get a wonderful moyo.]
;B[cf]C[enjolras [13k\]: no problemo

GB> I would have pushed from below, probably C11, since the corner is in a better shape than the lower three stones.]

(;B[fr]C[GB> There was no need to take these (yet).];W[ds]C[GB> Very small.]
;B[es]C[GB> This is also very small. What if White makes one more mover here? You lose one point. You are still doing OK at this point, since White's big moyo in the center is quite open, so it will not be easy to turn it into territory.

Something like P15 or around F14 would have been worth much more than this single point.]
;W[cs]C[GB> Small point #3     8-).];B[hp];W[gn];B[go]C[GB> This whole sequence starting where you secured your group with move 91 has been a series of very small moves on both part.]
