AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi,

I'm playing white against a rather strongish 30k in this game, thanks for the 
review ;)

SC:  I will preface my comments with my initials.  When you are giving a handicap, you have to play rather aggresivly.  Attack a lot.  Invade a lot.  Confusion is good for white.  If you can barely keep track of what is going on, black should be completely lost.  Don't let black have an uncomplicated game.]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[nr]TR[op]SQ[np]C[SC:  In general, the opening game is played on the third and fourth lines.  Think carefully before you play on the second or first lines early in the game.  O4 (the square) is a better way to extend from this stone.  P4 (triangle) is a good way to make things complicated for black.

You could play an approach move in another corner.  Normally, you would not leave a contact fight with just this one stone. When giving a handicap, however, this can be a way to confuse black.  Instead of finishing this contact fight before moving on, you start three or four contact fights in different areas. Then, you play one or two moves at a time in each of the different areas before you move to another area. Since several moves in other areas seperate the moves in a particular contact fight, it is harder to keep in mind what you are doing.  Hopefully, black will lose track of what he is doing in at least one area and make an error.  Also, hopefully you won't lose track of what you are doing.]
;B[or];W[kq]SQ[jp][kp]C[SC:  White has made a very low group.  It is too close to the lower side and would be fairly easy to pin against that side. Balance your third line move with a fourth line move like one of the squares.  In general, about half of your opening game moves should be on the third line and half on the fourth line.]
;B[iq];W[mo]SQ[fc][jd][nc]C[SC:  This white group is stable enough for now.  It isn't completely alive yet, but white should still play elsewhere.  When giving a handicap, you will have to leave some groups before they are completely settled to attack somewhere else.  White should play something like one of the squares.]
;B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[pj]C[SC:  Good, white has taken Sente and moved on to a different area.]
;B[pk]
(;W[qj]SQ[ok][qk]C[SC:  This is too calm.  Black is getting off to easily.  Play one of the squares and attack black strongly.  White should start a lot of fights.  Since white is giving a big handicap, white should be better at killing black's stones than black is at killing white.  See variation.]
;B[qk];W[qf]SQ[nq][kq]C[SC:  This is a better extension.  Your previous extension between the two marked stones was a bit small.]
;B[qe];W[rf]SQ[pf]C[SC:  Q14 is better.];B[re];W[og];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[mh];W[ok]SQ[cf][dj][cn]C[SC:  Play away from here.  There are still a lot of wide open spaces to be claimed.  Something like the squares is better.]
;B[ol];W[nk];B[nl];W[ll]C[SC:  This is fairly small.  White's two groups are stable enough so you don't need to connect them.  This move will encourage black to either seal off the area at O7 to make solid territory or connect the K10 and J3 stones.  Either of these is good for black.  Don't play moves that force you opponent to make moves that help him.]
;B[ml];W[mk];B[mm];W[lm];B[mn];W[ln]SQ[ll][lm]C[SC:  Now black has solid territory around Q7.  White has not made any territory in exchange.  These stones make a wall, but it is pointed towards strong black stones at K10 and J3.  Plus, white ends in Gote.]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[jp];W[kp];B[jr]
(;W[lr]SQ[lo][lp][lq][mq][mr][ls][ms]C[I chose this move for 
better eyeshape, though i'm not sure if it's really necessary

SC:  Not necessary.  This white group has enough space to make two eyes.  A good rule of thumb is to see if a group encloses more than 6 empty spaces.  If so, it is almost certainly alive (unless you can cut off one part of it).  This group enclosed 8 spaces prior to the last move.  So, it is alive.  You could just block at L2, but this is an endgame move and we are still in the opening.  
White should take Sente and play elsewhere. Black could attack the area around M2, but it won't amount to much.  Most likely, black will respond to White's move and then white can come back a play here in the endgame.  See variation.]
;B[kr];W[ms]C[SC:  This is also an endgame move.  Leave the group and play elsewhere.]
;B[os]
(;W[ns]C[SC:  This isn't even worth a whole point.  If white ignored this move and black played O1, white could still connect at M1 later. See variation for a better option.]
;B[ks];W[lq]C[SC: Now white has two eyes and is completely alive.]
;B[ls]C[SC:  This move doesn't affect the score at all.  Black just wasted a move.]
;W[ni]C[SC:  This protects the cutting point at P10, but does it need to be protected?  Black would be cutting apart two live groups. Cutting apart living groups doesn't accomplish anything.  So, you don't need to defend this cut.  This move encloses one or two points of territory for white, but there are a lot of places to play that are worth more.]
;B[nh];W[oh];B[ng];W[of]SQ[dp][jj][pd]C[SC:  Play a bigger move elsewhere.  The entire top and left sides are still wide open.  If we draw a line from A1 to T19 (through the marked stones) we divide the board in half.  We are past move 50 and the only stone in that entire half of the board is the handicap stone at D16.]
;B[oe];W[nf];B[mf];W[mi];B[me];W[fc]C[SC:  Good.];B[ec]
(;W[fb]C[SC:  F16 is better.  Around J17 is also possible.  See variation]
;B[eb];W[ic]C[SC:  This is another low group with little or no outward influence toward the center.]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[kc];W[id];B[jd];W[dj]C[SC:  Good.  The top side group is stable enough for now.]
;B[dk]
(;W[cj]C[SC:  This is too calm.  Now would be a good time to start a huge fight.  See variation for one of many possibilities.]
;B[ck];W[cf];B[df];W[dg];B[ce]
(;W[bg]SQ[cg]C[SC:  This looks like an attempt to protect a possible cutting point at C13.  However, if white just descends to B14, black can't sucessfully cut.  See variation.]
;B[bf];W[cg];B[ae];W[bk];B[bl];W[aj];B[al];W[ak]C[SC:  This isn't worth enough to bother with now.  Save this for late in the endgame.]
;B[ef];W[gf];B[eg];W[eh];B[fg];W[if]SQ[gf]C[SC:  Moving out from the top side group is good.]
;B[jf];W[ig];B[ie]C[SC:  This is a Gote move for black since he will have to connect at K15 after white responds.  So, unless this is the beginning of an attack, it is not worth enough to bother with now.]
;W[he];B[je];W[jg];B[kg];W[ki];B[kh];W[jh];B[li];W[kj];B[lj]
;W[kk];B[lk]C[SC:  Black has managed to cut apart white's groups.  But, since they are both alive, this doesn't do anything useful.]
;W[mj];B[lh]C[SC:  Plus black ends in Gote.];W[gi];B[cm];W[cq]
C[I thought I'd rather attack the corner before it's too late

SC:  This is a good time to invade.];B[br]C[SC:  This implies that black wants to kill white rather than contain the invasion.  Killing will be difficult, particularly since black is getting a handicap and thus should be less skilled at killing invasions.

In general, white (when giving a large handicap) should make a lot of invasions that are almost too deep or too far.  Black (when receiving and large handicap) should focus on containing these invasions to small areas and building territory near the invasion as white struggles to make some small eye space.

Don't try to kill invasions, just torture them to gain benefit elsewhere.]

move

;B[eo];W[fp];B[fo];W[gp];B[go];W[gr]C[SC:  Makes good shape.]
;B[hp];W[hq]TR[jj]SQ[ek][jn]C[SC:  This area is stable now that you have good shape.  Play a bigger move like E9 or K6.  White needs to seal the stone at K10 into as large an area as possible.  This is the only remaining unclaimed area of significant size.]
;B[hr];W[gq];B[ho];W[jn];B[in];W[fk];B[fl];W[ek];B[el];W[hl]
;B[gk];W[gl]C[SC:  Good.];B[gm];W[il];B[hm];W[im];B[kb]C[SC:  This was black's best remaining move.]

done too much with that corner anyway

SC:  O15 is better for black.];W[fh];B[gg];W[hh];B[fd];W[gd]
;B[fe];W[ge]SQ[se][rj][hs][ea]C[SC:  This is small and Gote.  The squares are all Sente and worth more than this.]
;B[hg]
(;W[hf]SQ[ga][ia][ha][gb][hb][hd][hc][gc]C[SC:  You are connecting two live groups.  This does not change the score so it is a wasted move.  White's top group encloses more than 6 empty spaces so it should be alive.  See variation.]
;B[ea];W[fa];B[ja];W[ia];B[ka]C[SC:  Black should have finished making Sente moves before doing this.  Black is too focused on this one area and did not look for the best move on the whole board.  S9 and S10 are the biggest area still undecided.]

(;W[gh]C[SC:  This is 1 point in Gote.  See variation for the way I would play out the remaining moves.]
;B[sf];W[sg];B[se];W[rg];B[rk];W[rj];B[sk];W[ff];B[ed];W[sj]
;B[ql]C[SC:  Black doesn't need to do this.];W[hs];B[ir];W[is]
C[SC:  You don't have to finish this now.  Just play the Sente move at H1 and go on to something else that is also Sente (like O15).  Come back to play this Gote move after you run out of Sente moves.]
;B[js];W[gs];B[jq];W[ag];B[af]
(;W[hc]C[SC:  This isn't needed.  See variation.];B[do]C[SC:  This isn't needed either so white doesn't lose Sente.]
;W[ne];B[nd];W[pe];B[md]C[SC:  Black should just defend at P16.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[oe];B[tt]C[SC:  Black wins by 24 1/2 points.
(Including 6.5 points komi).

The 6.5 point komi is unusual.  Normally, komi is only for even games.  Komi is to "pay back" white for the disadvantage of going second.  With a handicap game, the handicap stones take care of the difference between the players.  So, with a handicap, komi should be 0.5 (which just means that white wins ties).  Thus, in an even game, black plays first and gives white 6.5 komi.  In a 1 stone handicap game, black still just plays first but only gives 0.5 komi.  

In this game, a 6.5 komi is worth about the same as another handicap stone.  So, white really gave a 6 stone handicap in this game.]

The second eye isn't complete, but white can make a second eye by playing at either L8 or L7, so black can't prevent this eye. Thus, there is no need to actually finish the eye now.
