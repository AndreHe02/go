C[Michael: Hello dear reviewer.  This is a game between myself (11kyu KGS) and the captain of our go club (5kyu KGS.)

I don't understand where it all went wrong.  But I came out of fuseki in bad shape and midgame was a disaster.  I feel like I played far worse than my rank, but I don't remember making anything that seemed like a blunder right after I played it, except of course my last move.

dc: Hi, I'm dancor on KGS/IGS.  I'll mark my comments with dc.  I think the first problem here is that the opening joseki gives the corners to White.  This is already very questionable for Black.  Secondly, Black doesn't make use of the central-facing walls that he gets in the opening.  This could be seen as a kind of weakness in whole-board thinking, which also relates to the third thing -- Black persues overly aggressive small fights while letting a large group of eyeless stones get disconnected.

I should also mention an important stragetic distinction.  Six ranks is a huge difference, and if your goal is to try to maximize your chance of winning you are going to have to take huge aggressive risks and realize that your chance of winning is very low anyway -- this is exactly like when you are losing in the middle of game against an opponent of the same rank.  Alternatively, if you are trying to play "at your rank" in the sense that you don't lose by more than say 60 points, your strategy will be the exact opposite and more like it is to win a normal handicap game or "securing the win" when you find you are winning in the middle of a game against an opponent of the same rank.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[cn]C[dc: I have a very literal interpertation of "corners, then sides, then middle", and I would treat the more open corner first by playing instead at bP4.  A 3-4 corner opening is not a one-move treatment of the corner the way that a 4-4 opening is.  Another way of saying this is that weather or not a 3-4 corner becomes an enclosure is a very big deal!  Enclosures represent a lot of corner territory secured very early.]
;W[fq];B[bp];W[cl];B[cj]C[dc: The joseki continuation here is bC3, the same place White normally plays instead of wC8 in the more common and less aggressive line.  Don't let White trick you into complexity.  And realize the importance of corners in the opening!]
;W[cq]C[dc: Now Black isn't grounded, doesn't have eyespace, and is on the run.]
;B[en];W[el];B[gn];W[qf];B[kq]C[dc: Play urgent moves before big ones.  This is a "big" move -- playing low on the side with at least three points on either side of you says "I'm going to make a two-space jump one way or the other, thereby grabbing points away from you inside your framework".  The weakness of the bC6 group is very urgent.  This move bL3 actually worsens the urgent situation: it invites a splitting attack now or later around wJ4/wJ5/wK5 since it is just far enough away from the weak group.]
;W[bq];B[qh]C[dc: bB7 is really needed here. B7 and B3 are miai for stabilizing your weak group and wB3 has been played.  The forcing move of wB7 will hang in the air.

Also, bO17 is much a more common continuation.  bR12 is more complex and usually ends with more corner territory for White, which White is already starting to get too much of for comfort.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc]C[dc: This is a joseki mistake.  I recommend looking up Kogo's joseki dictionary online for the treatment of this joseki.]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[fc];B[fe]C[dc: This is another overly complex joseki choice.  "Leaning" knight moves like this are a main culprit among moves that feel more severe than they are -- that White stone is not so pressured as you might think.]
;W[cc];B[dc]C[dc: This is another joseki mistake.  Again, I recommend Kogo's.  You want bC16 to claim the large area on the left, the wall's strength would work well with bC10.]
;W[cd];B[ce];W[cb];B[db];W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[nq]C[dc: This seems like "playing out miai" to me.]
;W[qm];B[pk];W[ic];B[jd]C[Michae: This is pretty much the end of fuseki.  I feel like I got the short end of the stick somehow...

dc: This move is too aggressive.  The White stones are low.  bJ15 is a better way to try to make something in the middle.  This area around P7/P6 is a similar pushing point.

White has about 10 points of sure territory near _each_ corner.  Black has a number of promising walls but has to start imagining how he might eventually get territory.  I still think the best move here is bB7 to strengthen Black's weakest group while pressuring White's weakest group at wC8.  If Black can stabilize before White, Black can use threats on White's group to effectively claim a central area.]
;W[id];B[ie]C[Michael: This was probably a mistake looking back, should I have just extended?

dc: I'm not sure, you end up do managing to hold White in here.]
;W[je];B[he];W[kc];B[kd];W[ld];B[ke];W[lc];B[ne];W[jf];B[le]
C[dc: This is a good move.];W[jc];B[hq]C[dc: I like this for showing some concern/connection toward the weak group.  However, playing low like this instead of creating more of a connection to the weak group makes it seem like a big-not-urgent move that isn't that big (claiming 4 points of territory at J2/K2).]
;W[dj]C[Michael: Things really start falling apart after this move...

dc: Now White is stabiling his weak group first.];B[di]C[dc: Playing too close to a weak group.  The cutting point C11 is not easy to deal with.  You have to submit and play bC11 here.  You would probably still have the chance to push down on the White group around bH9 later, to gain something on the right.]
;W[ej];B[gj]C[Michael: This was probably too greedy.

dc: Too close again, bH9 or further.];W[ei]C[dc: This is "squeezing out the toothpaste".]
;B[dh];W[gi];B[gl]C[dc: The pattern of the three stones is weak since wF7 peeps two places at once.  bH8 is better.]
;W[ii];B[fi]C[dc: It's gone too far for this.  bK9 seems reasonable.  The upper left Black group isn't going to get much territory, just remember to keep it alive.]

;W[hk];B[jh];W[ih];B[ig];W[ji];B[jg];W[il];B[kf];W[ho];B[im]
;W[jm];B[in]C[dc: This is a good move.];W[jn];B[gp]C[dc: As we see bG4 is too optimistic with wJ5 being a forcing move.  bJ5 is very strong locally -- the pattern formed by wH5/bJ6/bJ5/wK6 is one you should remember.  Connection is very, very important, especially against higher-ranked players.]

;W[jq];B[ln];W[kr];B[qr];W[ip]TR[gl][im][cn][en][gn][in][bp]
[gp][hq]C[Michael: I resigned at this point because the marked stones have died.  And I don't really have any territory anywhere...

dc: I'm not sure, bB7 makes eyespace and threatens connection to bC10.  But it looks like White can cut off at least some.

To recap,
- Emphasize corners in the opening.
- Deal with weak groups (which might be forced to run and be attacked if they can't get eyespace). Strengthen yours. Attack your opponent's (from a distance, closing them in, making territory on the other side). Definitely play moves between two opposing weak groups that strengthen you and weaken them (bB7).
- Whereever your opponent gets corner territory and you get a strong outward-facing wall, you will have to put that wall to work.  Create frameworks with them, drive weak enemy groups toward them.  Doing this effectively is subtle.
- Emphasize connection.  This is the area where you most want to play it safe in handicap games, but even in general it is way more important than is realized.
- Think about the whole board.  What is changing around the local fight?  Is another group being weakened or cut off?

This my final comment.];C[Result: W+Resign])
