C[To the reviewer:

As always, I'd like to thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  I've been thinking quite a bit about what I've been doing wrong, and it seems that I fall behind early in the game either by my opponent's building a large moyo, or by my ending up with a bunch of weak groups which my opponents can attack easily.    With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger, Fedya on KGS

The famous Ted from the newsgroups.  It's an honor to review your game.  You've brought the level of rec.games.go up a notch by your presence!

If any of my comments bring up questions.  Don't hesitate to send it back for clarification.

(;W[nq]C[Fedya: I'm not entirely certain how one should go about attacking the Chinese fuseki.  I played here mostly because I like the idea of being the first to approach my opponent.  I could have done better locally, but I don't think the result is that terrible.

This is a decent idea.]

C[Fedya: Black captures two of my stones, but I get the chance to invade somewhere on the right side.

You didn't have to capture this stone.  You aren't in Atari and if he puts you in atari then you capture.  This is basically a "Pass"

You also ended in Gote.   See the variation for better];B[do]

(;W[fp]C[Fedya: I think this was a mistake.  I should have played G3 instead.  At the time, I wanted to put pressure on the D5 stone and give myself a better chance of jumping out into the center quickly.

Thinking that you need to jump out into the center is wrong.  You already have a wall over shadowing any moyo black can make.  You have accomplish your task.  F4 seems correct to me for other reasons though.  There is a very small number of joseki arising from this move and that makes the game simple for white.  It also attacks L4 from a distance.  L4 is high so has no base on the side.  Attacking it low makes no sense, so a high move is called for here.]
;B[cq]
(;W[dr]C[This is a mistake.  It gives black the corner  and makes his life way to easy]
;B[hp]
(;W[fn]C[Fedya: I took a long time trying to figure out what to do here.  My white group now looks weak, since Black is attacking it from two sides.  After a good deal of thought, I decided that the best chance would be to run out to the center to get one eye, figuring that I'd be able to get a second eye along the side.]
;B[cr]C[Black takes the key point.]
(;W[jd]C[Fedya: I thought Black's previous move gave me sente.  I don't know what to do with it, however.  Should I have invaded immediately somewhere between the Q17 and Q11 stones?

Whites groups still seems unsettled to me.  It's got no real eye shape and you are not putting any real pressure on either of blacks groups.  If you are going to attack the black stones on the bottom in the future you'll have to play at K3 or J3 and uproot them.  Hopefully they have no place to run.  Of course he'll have to put those stones into action first so you can't play K3 or J3.  If he puts them into action he'll settle first and that means he'll play around G3 to get a base.  G3 uproots your white stones.  So they need a place to run to or a base of thier own.]
;B[cf]
(;W[ch]C[Fedya: I decided to try the pincer attack here since everything I've been told implies that it's good to play it if you have a stone in the area where the marked stone is (K16, in this case).

If you can make territory on the top by pincering black and forcing him into the corner then yes this is good.  However how much territory are you going to make at the top.  Isn't Q17 staring daggers underneath your potential territory?  I don't think you'll get as much as you hope for.  If K16 were at K17 then I would say this is a good variation.  if Q17 were at Q16 I'd say this is a good variation.  but I don't think this is right witht he current stone configuration.  Black well end with sente.]

(;W[om]C[Fedya: This isn't deep enough, is it?  I was pretty confident that the right thing to do was to invade between Black's wall and Q11, but I don't know where the right point is. Q8?  R7 or R8??

Deep enough seems to imply that you think Black is ahead.  You need to count better.  What is the score?

Black has 10 in the lower left, 20 in the top right, 10 in the lower left for about 40 points.

White has 20 on the top, 10 on the left, and if he can attack the black stone on the bottom or the top left for at least 10 more in each spot. So White has 50 points.

If White plays at C17 black has a floating group with no eyes at all and can chase it right into black group on the left destroying any territory black might have gotten there.

If white simply makes even trades for Territory he'll win this game.

As to your question.  Notice that all of blacks stone in the top right are on the 4th line, and there is a wide extention between Q15 and Q11.  White should be able to play under these stones and get a live group there destroying any territory at all.  See the variation.]
;B[pl];W[pm];B[qm];W[ol];B[pk]C[This just solidfied territory for black on the side, ruining potential invasion points.]
;W[qn]
(;B[pn]
(;W[on];B[rn];W[po]C[Why capture?  P6 did it's job, it sealed the weakness in Whites wall.  The capture is only worth 4 points.  Surely there are bigger plays then that left.

C17 is still the biggest point on the board];B[qo];W[pn]C[Why connect?  It's gote and the stone you saved is unimportant.]
;B[rm]C[Unnecessary];W[nc]C[Fedya: I thought quite a long time about this move, too.  I was thinking of invading immediately at Q13, figuring that I'd be able to connect out to the chain of stones at K16.  I decided on this move since I thought it would get me more territory, while at the same time making the Q13 invasion easier in that I'd be more likely to connect out.  I think this was a mistake, however, in that Black's next moves make the Q13 invasion impossible.

C17 is the only hope for white, otherwise he has to capture something big!]
;B[cc]C[White has to capture the black stones on the bottom to win this game now. but I don't see how they will die.  As they run away they will connect to either the left or the right and escape.]
;W[dc];B[ld];W[lc];B[md];W[pg]C[Fedya: I don't know what I should have done here.  On the one hand, I have to invade, since I'm trailing.  If I don't play here, Black will get 50+ points along the right, as well as 20 points or so on the left and the small group at the bottom.  I've got about 25 points at the top, and three weak groups that I have to hope can make territory.  Since I'm so far behind, I think the invasion is the only thing I can do.

This is a desperate play by white.  O17 is a wasted move for white, black can play down at N17 and capture it, and Q13 will die a natural death without any real effort by black.]
;B[og]C[Fedya: Black sensibly plays to prevent me from running out.]

(;W[qh];B[qi];W[rh];B[rf]C[Fedya: Black again plays sensibly, as S14 is a point I could use to get an eye.]

(;W[rk]C[Fedya: I was still desperately trying to come up with some way to make the invasion work.  I was hoping here that I could get to play the splitting move at R8 at some point.]

;W[mi];B[mj];W[gm];B[li];W[kr]C[Fedya: The invasion failed, but as I looked at the position I thought that perhaps I might be able to put pressure on Black's stones at the bottom.
