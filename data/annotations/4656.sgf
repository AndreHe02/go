(;W[cf]C[I felt like it was necessary to move along, although I was reluctant to do so. Whenever I play, especially with beginners, neither person knows when it is best to leave a group alone. In this case I think my opponent made the right move and made trouble for me. Maybe 12 at Q15 would have been better?

$ there is no pressure at all on black here. Black has 6 liberties (more than 5 is considered super-stable). A is captured and makes an eye. and if Black play on point '6' then white last stone is treatenned

$ at this stage, white must develop by corner approch (triangle points), C6 the best.]
;B[re]TR[rd]C[$ see, white must answer if he wants to save its stone, although leaving the stone and play elsewhere is best.]

(;W[sd]LB[lc:B][rc:C][sd:A][se:D][cn:E][fq:G][jq:F][nq:H]C[Eh? I wasn't too sure about this move, especially after blacks answer. The variation here is better I think.

$ if you want to save your stone, play C, because black D make white C saving white 2 stones. If white C now, black can't play sente move here.

B is better but i prefer (in order) : E, then F, then G or H.]
