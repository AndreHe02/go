C[
Hi, thank you for taking time to review my game.

I lost this one be a relatively small margin, and im sure there are a few details that i didn't notice that you can point out to me.

Also, can you show me any good yose moves/techniques i may have missed?

Thank you!

CB> on this side it can be coherent with your previous move, but the three other sides are bigger and if white protects, he's very strong. Maybe you think you will loose the game?]
