C[Dave: Hello, I'll be reviewing this game. I'm about 12k or 13k, so don't expect any miracles :)

I'm not familiar with any joseki on 13x13, if there are even any formal ones, so we'll have to make do with my intuition and some elbow grease.]
;B[dd]C[Dave: For me, this first move shows up on D10, in case your board is rotated. In most cases, I'll try to use letters and those polygons that seem to be the standard to identify stones, but I might use coordinates for some reason or another.]
;W[dj];B[jd];W[jj]C[Dave: Fairly standard?];B[eh]TR[dd]C[Dave: I find this move to be a little strange. On 19x19, one hardly ever plays the 5th line as an approach, and I don't see a real reason for it to be played here either. This stone isn't helping to create a base with the marked stone, and if white goes under it, it will have to flee along dame points in the center, making no territory. And if black is aiming at the center, then tengen would probably be a better point since it would allow a wedge at G4 or other possible invasions. Otherwise, an approach on the third or fourth line would have been better.]
;W[gg]TR[eh]C[Dave: Now the problems with the marked stone are being revealed. This is a severe attack on the marked stone while at the same time making great center influence. Black is already in trouble.]
;B[gd]C[Dave: Black chooses to defend against the wedge.];W[ef]
TR[eh]C[Gabi: I think it is a good attacking move. What do you think about is?

Dave: It is a good move, and the most important part of the board now that black sealed off the top with his last move. White can expect to either capture the marked black stone or damage black's upper territory.]

(;B[dg]TR[eh]SQ[gg][ef]CR[jg][jh][kh][kg]LB[kk:a][ii:b][hh:c]
[gj:d][cg:e]C[Zoli: How to get more territory?

Dave: One important point I'd like to make is not to be overly attached to one's stones. Before discussing whether trying to save the triangle stone was the best option, let's look at other possible options first.

One option is playing the slide at A instead of D7. See the variation for that.

Anoter option of course is tenuki. Though this is less of an option on 13x13 than 19x19, we can note that white has spent two stones, the squared stones, to capture one black stone, the triangle stone. The captured black stone and accompanying territory may not be worth the extra move white used, or it might be of about equal value. Black can choose simply to let white have the triangle stone and grab a chunk of empty territory by playing one of the circled squares. Then this will become white's moyo versus black's secured territory. Note that white is open on the left, so black can slide in later around A and destroy any territory white could make there. If white defends that side, black has other options such as a 3-3 invasion at B, reductions C or D, or a (risky) invasion at E. The invasion at E might be too difficult, but the other options should be worth just as much.

Basically, the game is far from over. Even if black sacrifices the triangle stone, it will still have aji later, and if black tries the invasion at E, the triangle stone will certainly help.

Now for the evaluation of the move played. Sorry it took me so long to get to this :). It is very important though that you think all your options through, especially in the beginning of the game. Sacrifice is often a very viable alternative.

Black chooses to bet everything on a fight here. I'm not sure if this is a good idea, since white is able to cut the black stones off, but the outcome is murky at this point. I myself would probably play A; see the variation for that.]

(;W[de]LB[df:a]TR[eh][dg]C[Gabi: This makes it difficult for black on D7 and E6.

Dave: This is an interesting move. The move I think of right away is A, which definitely cuts off the two marked black stones. However, the played move has interesting potential to ruin black's upper territory. I've added some variations for the attachment at A, and we'll also look at variations for the played stone as well. I think that the played stone has the most potential to turn black's upper territory into a black and white stew of dame points.]

(;B[df]LB[ce:a]C[Dave: I think A could connect the stones, or at least make life. See the variation.]
;W[ce]C[Dave: Black's stones are cut off.];B[cd];W[bg]LB[ee:a]
C[Gabi. A very good move i think.
Now black can just very hard live on D8, D7 and E6.

Dave: Yes, this is a quite dangerous move; black's stones look like they've had it. However, this may be an overplay; there is a possible weakness at A. See the variation for the next move.]

(;B[jg]C[Dave: Black cuts his losses and tenukis. However, he is behind in territory now.]
;W[ih]LB[ee:a]CR[ed]C[Dave: White should defend her weakness at A first. She can do so in sente by playing at the circled spot.]
;B[ki];W[jh];B[kh];W[ig];B[kf]LB[kc:a]C[Dave: I assume that this move is to protect against the 3-3 invasion at A. The 3-3 invasion is rather complex and difficult to read out here, but you should be able to kill it with the played stone in place.]
;W[jf];B[kg];W[je];B[ke];W[id]C[Dave: Overplay. Black can cut off this stone. See the variations later.]
;B[ie];W[if]
(;B[kd]LB[hd:a][ic:b]C[Dave: Bad move. White has a clever play at A. See the variation. Black should play at B instead; white cannot do anything.]

(;W[he]C[Dave: White misses out here.];B[ic]
(;W[hd]LB[hc:a]C[Dave: White can still make a ko by playing A. See variation.]
;B[hc];W[ed];B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[bd];B[bc];W[bf];B[fe]C[Dave: Small and gote; after white getting all those sente moves, black should be raring to take a big spot.]
;W[ee]LB[kj:a]C[Dave: Again, one important point is the evaluate the value of each move. Don't get attached to your stones; sacrifice them if there's a bigger move elsewhere. White only saves 4 points here, but a move around A is worth much more.]
;B[kj]C[Dave: Good eyes by black. This is a big move.];W[ac]
LB[jk:a]C[Dave: Blocking black off at A is bigger. See variations for the next move to see what black could have done.]

(;B[cc]C[Dave: Now black shows unwarranted attachment for his stones. This move, though big, is gote. Black should play some sente moves in the corner first. See variation.]
;W[kk];B[ji];W[ij];B[lk]C[Zoli: Now it's end of the game. B have very little chance to do something. Very bad position.

Dave: Yes, the game is about decided now. Since black was behind early on, he should have looked for more opportunities to make it up or start a big fight early on. Black should not have sit back quietly and let the game play out as simply as it did; black should look for alternatives. One important point is not to let the other player push you around the board, keeping sente, especially if you are behind. Consider carefully if you have to respond to each move. Even if the move is a threat, consider what you will lose if you ignore the threat. Perhaps you can make more than that by playing elsewhere. The endgame here had many of those opportunities.]
;W[jk];B[ii];W[hi];B[gk]LB[ck:a]C[Dave: It's too late for an invasion here. Invasions like this one should take place during the middle of the game. Now that white has solidified her borders and removed the aji of the dead stones, black cannot threaten to escape out through a white framework, as in the midgame. Instead, black must find life, which is usually too difficult.

The only spot that I think is open for invasion is the 3-3 point at A. I'm not too sure if that would work either, but it's got a better chance than the played stone I think.]

(;W[hk]LB[ek:a]C[Dave: Here are the start of white's problems with the invasion. In response to an invasion, especially one you know should die, try to avoid playing stones adjacent to invading stones, that is, playing tsuki like this move. Contact battles like this allow both sides to grow stronger, and while white is already strong, allowing black to grow stronger is very bad. Instead, stamp out possible eyespace and prevent black from making a base on the edge. I would recommend A. See the variation.]
;B[hl]C[Dave: Now black is given the chance to play a contact battle, and as his stones grow in number, his chance of making life grows too. Though this invasion is still probably a failure, you should remember these guidelines when dealing with invasions.]
;W[il];B[ek]LB[dk:a]C[Gabi. This move don't makes possibilities for black to live in this area.
Zoli: What to do?

Dave: This invasion is still dead. Black should not be able to live in this situation. White should respond at A, though.]
;W[gl]LB[ck:a]C[Dave: This is a big mistake for white at this stage of the game. This gives black the chance to take the 3-3 at A and live.]

(;B[dk]C[Dave: See variation for life in the corner. The played stone also seems to make life, though I can't read out all the variations.]
;W[fl];B[el]C[Dave: Now black seems to have secured some eyespace in the corner and probably will live.]
;W[fk]LB[cj:a]C[Dave: White should assume the worst now and try to limit the damage. Playing A first in sente would be best.]
;B[fm]LB[cj:a]C[Dave: Not a good move for black. Black should try to expand his territory with A.]
;W[ck]C[Dave: This is quite a severe attack on black, and I'm not sure if it works. It seems that this stone will live though.]
;B[cj];W[ci];B[bj];W[bk]LB[bi:a];B[di]
(;W[ej]C[Dave: White can save her stones still. See variation.]
;B[fj];W[gj];B[fi]C[Gabi. Hyba

Dave: I would just capture the two stones to remove the possiblity of white connecting out as seen before.]
;W[bi]LB[aj:a]C[Dave: Bad move. This destroys the opportunity for white to save her stones if black responds at A.]
;B[gm]C[Dave: This move is very bad. Basically black commits suicide. The sequence played here shows how black dies if white does not take the trade. And even if white takes the trade, black dies. See variation.]

(;W[hm]C[Dave: Taking the variation here kills black.];B[em]
LB[aj:a]C[Dave: Black is dead now no matter what he does. Even A cannot save him since white will jump in along the bottom.]
;W[aj];B[ei];W[cj];B[gh]LB[ll:a][ge:b]C[Dave: Struggling is pointless; the cut will not work. White should ignore this and play yose moves, such as A or B.]
;W[hh];B[ge];W[gf];B[ff];W[fg]C[Gabi. Black is now dead in the center.

Dave: Black has been dead for a while now ;)];B[gc];W[fh]LB[ll:a]

;W[ch];B[cg];W[ah];B[tt];W[kc]C[Dave: Dead.];B[lc];W[kb];B[jb]
C[Dave: I think black should defend the cut at K11. Bad things can happen when a group's outside liberties are filled at the end of the game. If later white can play K11 and then G13, black will be very short of liberties.]
;W[lb]
(;B[jc]C[Gabi: I think this was a mistake. Do you agree?

[li][mi][lj][mj][mk][ml][km][lm][mm]C[Dave: A fairly interesting game. What I would say to focus on most is the fuseki, the opening of the game. A game can develop in many ways; a loss in one part of the board can often still be made up in another part. Since moves at the beginning of the game are very valuable, usually worth about 10 points each, the number of moves it takes to kill a stone may be worth less than the stones captured. If your stones come under attack right away, consider how much you could stand to gain by sacrificing them. And even if you sacrifice them, strange things can happen in the middle of the game, and stones thought to be dead can suddenly come alive, or become useful in exploiting weaknesses in the opponent's structures.

Also, both players need to be careful of how to deal with invasions. Don't try to immediately surround and capture invading stones. Instead, starve the stones to death by eliminating possible eyespace. Don't let the invaders get a base along the edge. And do not get involved in a contact fight where some of your stones might be captured, resulting in life for the invaders. Above all, stay calm. Don't get panicky when someone plays a stone in what you think is your territory; stay focused and keep thinking about your moves.

Finally, the middle of the game was played fairly well. Be wary of the size of a move, though. Don't assume that an opponent will respond to a move simply because you are threatening to capture a stone; similarly, do not automatically save stones in atari. First check if those stones have any strategical value; are they surrounding territory or connecting groups? Would something terrible happen if they were captured? If not, then there might be a bigger move than saving the stones.

Well, that's the end of my comments. Keep playing go, and keep submitting games.]
