Thanks

(magic:)
Hi. I've marked my comments with (magic:). There will be some comments related to individual moves, some places where I take a step back and look at the situation in general and a summary at the end.  If you have any further qestions, please contact me.

Morten];B[cp];W[pp];B[dc];W[pc];B[pe]C[(magic:)
This is quite aggressive. You leave two half-finished enclosures to approach white.]
;W[nd];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb];B[pd];W[oc];B[qj];W[re]C[(magic:)
White is right that this is the defect of your shape. However, this is far too early to use this defect.]
;B[qd]C[(magic:) S16 or R15 are often better responses.
Also consider just taking sente to play somewhere else and, if he cuts, let him take the two stones whilst building thickness around (strengtening your stone at R10)]
;W[qg];B[pg]C[(magic:)
Use contact moves for defence, not for attack. You should be attacking here. I think that P13 does the same job as this move, without the dangers of a touching move. Touching moves make for weak lines of stones which can be cut apart...]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[ph];B[og]C[(magic:)
You had to play P13 after all - you are now in danger of being cut apart yourself. All of a sudden, this means that you must try that much harder to kill white - earlier you could just attack from a distance and gain strength.]
;W[qi];B[oi];W[oh];B[nh];W[pi];B[pj]C[(magic:)
These weak strings are results of plays which were too close to the white stones earlier. White can now cut through at will and live.]

(;W[oj]C[(magic:)
Hmm. I think that the proper sequence to cut is as shown in the variation]
;B[ni];W[sj];B[sk];W[si];B[rl];W[qe];B[qf];W[rf];B[pf]C[(magic:)
You don't need to defend this stone. It would only give a false eye. He lives already. Play elsewhere.]
;W[rd];B[sc];W[sg];B[rh];W[rg];B[sd];W[se]C[(magic:)
These moves may be sente, but once they have been played, they are gone. You may want to keep these moves for later as e.g. ko-threats.]
;B[nf]C[(magic:)
White is lucky to live here, I think.
Unfortunately, black is not left with a lot to compensate for the living white group.]
;W[nl];B[ok];W[nj];B[nk];W[mj];B[mk];W[lj];B[nm];W[lk];B[ml]
;W[pm];B[om]C[(magic:)
Q8 protects the cut, captures the stone, strengthens yuor group and attacks the single white stone.]
;W[pl];B[ol];W[pk]C[(magic:)
Don't alow yourself to be cut up like this. In this case it doesn't cost you too much, but often it would kill you.
All you gained was the capture of 1 stone - 2 points....  You risked a lot more.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[qm];W[on];B[po];W[qo];B[oo];W[op];B[no];W[qq]
;B[np];W[nq];B[mq];W[nr];B[rn];W[ro];B[sn];W[so];B[mr];W[ms]
;B[ls];W[ns];B[kr]C[(magic:)
These are (very very) small plays. There are still two open corners!]
;W[mp]C[(magic:)
There are far, far bigger point on the board. This cut does not work.]
;B[mo]C[(magic:)
Why not M4? Black could make a potential large territory at the bottom - don't help white destroy it.]
;W[lp];B[kq];W[lo];B[ql]C[(magic:)
Why?];W[ln];B[ll];W[lh];B[kl];W[jo]C[(magic:)
Black keeps pushing white in the direction white should want to go.]
;B[ip];W[jp];B[iq];W[im];B[ce]C[(magic:)  A play on the lower left would make a nice territory. This play on it own is good, but it doesn't really fit the overall position.

Look at the board:
White has 3 groups which are alive in the right hand lower, middle and upper side, but also 2 very weak groups making their way into the centre of the board. In between them, you have a strong group (it is alive). Since neither the top right black group nor the bottom right black group are very strong, you should be pushing the white groups from these groups towards your strong group in the center.]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[lq];B[lr];W[jq];B[jr];W[fr];B[gr]C[(magic:)
G3 is better. If white plays as in the variation, you will be very weak here.]

(;W[fp];B[gq];W[dr];B[fs];W[er];B[dp]C[(magic:)
This is dubious. Yes, you hinder white from running away into the centre, but you enable him to live on the spotwith e.g. B3]
;W[ep];B[dm];W[bq];B[bp];W[cq];B[gp];W[fn];B[dk]C[(magic:)
Good. You are making some territory on the left. If your top right group lives, white will have nothing to match it.]
;W[go]
(;B[ho]C[(magic:)
It is too late tot try to keep white apart here. Play elsewhere.  A good move would be anything which extends from your top left corner to wards the top right, or, failing that, a move which solidifies your left territory.
You should also try to ensure that your top right group will not get cut off.
White still has a weak group around M10. You should try to lean against this group and then 'bounce off' it into the top.
Your top right group is not alive yet, but it could probably live on the spot, so you shouldn't worry too much about it, but use it for attack.
The variation shows one possibility.];W[hn];B[io];W[in]C[(magic:)
All you are doing is walling yourself in. Save these moves until later.]
;B[gc]C[(magic:)
Good thouight, but too timid.  The white position is not that strong, you can happily play on the fourth line. Since the white position in front of you is open at the bottom, you will probably find that even K16 (threatening M17) is sente. This is too close to your own corner. Also see earlier remark about using your top right group to push with before taking the top.]
;W[cj]C[(magic:)
It seems that white likes deep invasions. You should welcome this.]
;B[ck];W[cg]
(;B[jc]C[(magic:)
Yes, this is a good move (although it would have been better on the 4th line if your stone at G17 was at G16), but this is not the time to play it. White has just created a weak group on the left (you have strong positions around it) and you should be attacking him. E14, or E13 if you are adventurous both attack him and expand your top left corner, and make any plays you do later on the top worth more.  BTW, notice the sequence in the variation - you can (not now, but later, if need be) rob white of his base.]
;W[dj];B[ek]C[(magic:)
This is very submissive. The proverb says to 'Hane at the head of 2 stones']
;W[ej];B[dg];W[cf];B[df];W[be];B[bd]C[(magic:)
Same variation - watch out for these.];W[cd];B[dd];W[de];B[ee]
;W[cc];B[ce];W[bc];B[de]C[(magic:)
Ooh, that hurts. That was probably a loss of > 30 points.];W[ad]
;B[ch];W[bh];B[dh];W[bi];B[fi];W[bk];B[bl];W[gh]C[(magic:)
??
Strange move. But it is not necessarily easy to say how to punish him for it. I suoppose it is meant as a sort of extension from his stones at M10. He creates another weak group for you to attack.]
;B[fh]C[(magic:)
I think G11 is better - it keeps him separated from the group at the bottom. He cannot connect to the group on the left side anyway.]
;W[hg];B[jf]C[(magic:)
None of these move serve much purpose.
Possible purposes of a move:
Attack a weak group
Defend a weak group
Create (potential) territory
Create influence

H13 is a complete mystery.  K14 maybe can be said to attack (?), but it is too loosely connected to the other stones to be very strong.  Earlier comment regarding leaning on the stone at M12 is still valid. Or, failing that, J9 cuts him off from the bottom or M14 cuts him off from the top right.]
;W[fg];B[gf]C[(magic:)
Why? You peep at a cut - he responds and you have not gained anything, except for a stone touching your opponents. Peeps are not useful unless they serve another purpose as well. If you want to make sure he doesn't make an eye, play F14, but that's not required at the moment.  There are no urgent local plays. See last comment for suggestions.]
;W[gg];B[eg]C[(magic:)
If this was what you wanted, you should have played this straight away.]
;W[gi];B[fj];W[gj];B[gk];W[hk];B[hf]C[(magic:)
Now he is connected and his centre is strong.];W[gl];B[fk];W[jk]
;B[lc]C[(magic:)
Good. This was probably the last big point in the game.];W[mb]
;B[lb];W[mc];B[me];W[lf];B[le];W[mf]C[(magic:)
You really must answer this at O15...];B[kg];W[kf];B[ke];W[mg]
;B[ne];W[ng];B[kh];W[ki];B[ji]C[(magic:)
No more useful comments until summary at the end. Just a quick note on endgame order of the moves:
You should, simplistically, play first those mves which are sente and worth most. Fiddling around in the centre is not normally big. The biggest move on the board is probably in the upper left, followed by top right, left centre and left bottom.]

;W[ob];B[dq];W[mm]C[(magic:)
This was an unusual game to comment on. There were no flagrant faults on any sides that I could see, but many suboptimal plays and mistakes in direction. But I suppose that the biggest thing which struck me was the overall 'lack' of awareness of big moves versus small, urgent moves versus non-urgent moves. Especially in the beginning - it is unusual to invade during the fuseki, and it is unusual to have to fight to survive with a group before 3 of the corners have been settled in/around. However, white, the player most guilty of these errors, won in the end.
Black went wrong in choosing not to attack white but to lay back and defend, being althogether too timid, and also in 'wasting' several moves when there were some very good moves to be made.

Some things to look at:
Understanding urgent and non-urgent moves, as well as big versus small. Always try to picture the overall board, don't get drawn into local fights. In the beginning, often you will gain by ignoring an attack in order to play large moves elsewhere. (E.g. sacrificing unimportant stones)
Do not play sente moves (endgame-type moves on the edge, peeps and ataris) just because they are sente. Keep them as ko-threats or play them when they have a value of their own, in addition to being sente.
For more ideas on how to outline your territory, push out from it or defend it, or attacking others stones, try to cast your eyes on 'Attack and Defence' by Davies. It is a very good book and gives much excellent advice which can be applied at all levels.

But, most of all - keep playing :-)

Good luck.])

I cannot see black living anywhere. If he connects, he loses, if he takes he loses.  Try the variations yourself - maybe you see something I don't.]
