C[To the reviewer:     I'm not certain exactly where I went wrong in this game. I think I ended up with multiple weak groups, and my opponent was able to take advantage of this. Things snowballed from there and got progressively worse. The problem is that looking at what I did in the beginning, everything still looks reasonable.     Thank you in advance for the review!     Ted Schuerzinger Fedya (~14k) on KGS    
    
djna - my feeling is thatoverall W played solid moves and exploited    
B's mistakes quite well. W actually made two bad errors, one allowing    
B to invade the bottom right corner and the other, unpunished, in invading    
the bottom left. W might find it useful to look through some pro games    
focusing on invasions.    
    
B (I can say this on the basis of your comments) is perhaps a little    
over concerned for the safety of small territiories in the opening.    
Also there were quite a few instances where I felt that B had not    
considered W's most likelly response, and his response to that. It's    
no feasible to read very far ahead all the time, but it is important    
to at least consider a likely answer or two.    
    
You did not so much have weak groups as fail to ensure    
connections when you had the chance. The only real weak group    
was the one in the top left. Had I been W I would have asked you    
to show how you would live. The big group that died was not    
weak until it got cut off. B simply should not allow the cut.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[po];B[dj]TR[po]LB[ci:a][di:b]C[Fedya: I'm not certain how -- if at all -- I should respond to an opponent playing the first move in a particular corner at 5-4. In this case, I decided to try developing normally and see what happens.          djna - No need to "respond", it doesn't threaten anything special. In fact I think that it is helpful that W has announced his interest in the right side. Now you can get some stones up there and he can't make full use of the 5-4 stone. Your decision to carry on with your own plan is good. However 5 is not really in the right place. A and B make the Chinese fuskei, 5 is just a bit too far away from 3.    
    
Personally, I'm suspicious of trotting out "standard" sequences, so    
if 5 is a conciuos experiment that's fine. If you are actually setting    
out to play the chinese then it's best to really study it.]
;W[ce]
(;B[fd];W[ch]
(;B[cm]C[Fedya: I feel like this move is defensive, especially since I end up with bad shape, but I feel like I have to do something for the stone at D10.               djna - this move is bad, it defends nothing worth defending. 5 is an     aggressive stone, you should be seeking to attack (or at least confine    
6 and 8.    
    
See the variation.];W[hc]LB[ec:a]C[     djna - this is quite agressive but as 6 + 8 are not under much pressure     it's probably quite a good idea. This indicates that B has already gone     a little astray; W at C would start to become annoying.          B Needs to do something with 3 and 7]
;FG[]
(;B[nc]C[Fedya: Would it have been better to play a pincer attack at K17 or L17 instead?               djna - See the variation. The problem is that W has an ideal answer, so this     move must be bad. Looks like an example of not consideringthe obvious response.]
;W[kc]C[     djna - very nice];B[qc]C[     djna - many alternatives to this, perhaps a high double approach would     ensure that you develop down the side.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[qe]C[djna - W should not play the hane with 1 in position. If you let W get     away with this then you get a poor position.]

(;B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc];B[re];W[qf];B[rf];W[qg]C[     djna - not a complete disaster as W is low at the top, but W moves near     H 5 start sktching out large areas.       Compare with the variation.]
;B[np]C[Fedya: I think this is a mistake, but again, I don't know how to handle the 5-4 opening. As it is, White gets much of the territory on the right and in the top, and I have to play from behind the rest of the game.          djna - this sort of idea might work if you had serious designs on the left side,     Problem is that W can grow that upper side quite quickly.          The "normal" 3-4 and 3-3 approached will yield W thickness and I think    
you would need a careful plan to cope with that.    
    
I'd be tempted to play a wild, unusual move such as R7, if W defends the    
corner ( and he porbably must) The R11 threatens to link with the top and    
a stable B group may emerge.    
    
The real problem here is that your moyo can't grow as fast as Ws    
and that's because you dont' have full value from 5 and 9.]
;W[pq]TR[pq]C[Fedya: I think now that this is where I should have played.          djna - it's the most common move, but I'm not sure that it really     works well here. However 15 is now looking sick]
;FG[];B[kq]TR[pq][ch]C[djna- That's twice you have made this shape. It's bad bacause of the     adjacent marked W stones.          This is a case where you could predict W Q3, it's the most obvious     answer to your move, and you really should plan a response to the     obvious move. You should not be happy with 1, so that should make     you question O4.          Suppose you had played O3 instead, W would probably stll play the     marked strone, then L3 or L4 might be quite nice.          P3 would also be a reasonable approach.]
;W[ql]C[Fedya: Look at White's position now compared to if I had played at Q3.        djna- Well he's taken 20 points with 3 stones and you have taken very     few with 2 so this feels bad. Though the corner is not     completely solid as you prove later.          However now is the time to look for where each side can grow more,     not to object to what they already have.          W S12 adds some 3rd line territory - not too bad, no real worries.          B K5 threatens a serious moyo - E3 next and there's lots of profit so     W will probably come steaming in. With any luck we can chase him out     and get some strength for eroding the top.          W moves around H15 are troublesome. It's tempting to play something     up there, but I prefer trying to make 1 look meaningful.]
;B[ff]C[djna - OK this is an idea, but it needs to be a two meaning move.     If it attacks the stones on the left and prepares to reduce the top     than it's good. I couldn't find a move that did both, that's why     I was suggesting the bottom.]
;W[hf]C[djna- so W is saying that you don't have an attack on the two stones.]
;B[bi]C[Fedya: I don't know if this is premature, but I felt I needed to consolidate my position on the left before White plays something like B10.        djna- decent move, wrong reason! You don't care too much about B10,     there are few points there. You don't want to consolidate, you need to     attack!          Probably playing from the top is better because you are weaker there.]
;W[bh];B[ci];W[gh]C[djna- intensely irritating, somehow your attack has allowed W to     get 4 and 8 in to make a huge moyo. What's worse, W B17     makes B look a little baseless.          Bottom line - I don't think 3 was a real dual purpose move, it may     not have been the losing move, but you are now at least two     mistakes behind now. It's quite reasonable to expect W to     make some too, so we don't give up yet.]
;B[nn]C[Fedya: I really don't have a clue what to play here. I have a weakness with the group at L3 and O4 that I have to address, as well as a weak group in the top left, *and* I have to stop White from taking most of the territory on the right and the top. I don't have a lost game already, do I?        djna - I would be feeling depressed about now. If W plays correctly It's     going to be tough. I think 9 is rather good. B needs W to overplay, if he     sees a large B moyo he might do something rash]
;W[nl]C[djna - this is a good answer though];B[jj]C[Fedya: I decided to play in the center, figuring this might help me reduce what territory White could get both above and to the right. Unfortunately, I had so many weaknesses to address that I was never able to connect my group in the center to anything else.        djna - seems like a well chosen spot]
;W[jh]
(;B[qq]C[Fedya: Probably another bad move, but I felt desperate already. It *does* live, but it's not much help.        djna - save this for later you need to grow your mojo and reduce W's    You have sente, and can't afford to lose it.          Moves like 13 should always lose sente. W should plan to kill you or let     you live in gote. Or even completely ignore you, M11 would proabably    take more territory than you can grab in the corner.]
;W[qp];B[qr]C[djna - as far as I can tell this simply does not work. W makes an error     but really B is dead. Q2 is better, B either lives with the tripod group or     makes a nice little territory on the side.]
;W[pr];B[rp];W[ro];B[sq];W[qs]C[djna- surely S2 just kills?]
;B[rs];W[rr]C[djna - could be a high level strategy along the lines of your variation    or random thrashing about.]
;B[ps]
(;W[os]TR[nn][np]C[Fedya: I think it would have been better for White to play at T2. Black will be able to live in the corner in any case, but White should be able to kill the two stones at O4 and O6, and take a *lot* of territory in the process.        djna - Yes, if W is not going for your variation then getting away to more    important ares of the board is better, so this move is bad.]
;B[sr];W[or];B[rn]C[Fedya: Another big mistake. I misread this position and thought I'd be able to connect out to the stone at O6.        djna- At first I thought that this was too small, but if it works then it's     actually pretty good because it's points in sente. I think W has to ensure the     connection of his group so he must answer. If the move did not threaten    the whole group then W should ignoire the move as it's just a threat    far less than 10 points.         So, does it work?]
;W[so]C[djna -W is brave. If he plays Q7, conceding some points then you've     got profit but he's out of danger.]
;B[qn]LB[nj:a]C[djna - at this point I assume you still thought you could connect.          If you realise that it does not work then try a move such as O10     now. If W protects around 29 You can reduce the top quite alot.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[on]
(;B[oo]C[djna- This is not playable when you're losing. You simply have    to find something else to do. Expand your side, or move into the top.    removing W's weakness like this is a very bad.]
;W[om];B[op];W[pp]C[Fedya: And now my group in the bottom center is *really* weak.        djna - I just don't see that. It almost alive anyway and has plenty of room.]
;B[lj];W[rm]C[djna - paranoia? This give you a free move elsewhere - must size the chance!]
;B[hj]C[djna - I think this is the right idea but the wrong point. What about L7?    Also ties groups together but now a B moyo emerges. By joining two    fragile groups you get stength.]
;W[ll]C[djna - this makes 39 look much worse. M12 is now probably impossible.]
;B[hl]C[Fedya: I think it would have been better to play at F10 and ensure that the group in the center connects to the group on the left, but I thought I was strong enough that I'd be able to connect towards the bottom. Either I was wrong, or I erred later in the game.            djna - too negative, play H10 take some territory and connect. W must     invade the bottom left. Look for dual purpsoe moves.]
;W[hq]C[djna - W is counting on harrassing your groups, but he is inches from     death too. I think W would do better to get a solid foothold by attaching     in the corner at D3.]
;B[fq]C[Fedya: Should I have played on the other side, eg. at J4? For much of the next sequence I feel as though I'm flailing around with no idea what to do. I feel as though I have to defend against three weaknesses at one time (the group in the bottom center, the group in the center, and stop White from taking a bunch of territory in the corner), and there's no good way to do this   
   
   
djna - yes you must play from the weaker side. J4 asks some tough questions.   
Note though that W is entitled to a live group in the bottom left. You had     
a 4-4 stone, so W can invade. Originally W was allowed to live and you   
had the privilege of deciding where. You just want to get maximum   
leverage from letting him live. So your last objective is not realistic.   
As it happens 42 was probably a bad choice so you expect to harrass   
but the first thought has to me the weak groups, but if you play J4 then   
they surely connect.];W[gq]C[djna - this looks bad, what happens after J4 now? At the very least your     groups link up, but I don't see certain life for W.]
;B[fp];W[fr];B[er];W[fs]C[djna - W is feeling the pressure. This is a bad shape move]
;B[hs]C[Fedya: I thought I'd try the eye-stealing tesuji, but it's pointless here.        djna - yes, confine him first, then take the eyes.]
;W[ir];B[jo];W[kr];B[lr];W[ks];B[lq]C[djna - far too small, H5 takes a lot of territory and patches up all your     weaknesses.]
;W[ho]C[djna - hmm I wrote the last comment before seeing this move!]
;B[hn]C[Fedya: I think I should have played at J6 instead.        djna - It's very difficult now. By the time you've looked     after you groups some territory will go. The real mistake     is to try to hang on to both.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[io];B[in];W[jn]C[djna - you need to see this cut coming and prevent it - conceivably     it all hangs together for B but I certainly can't calculate all the     possibilties. By and large getting into this sort of tactical mayhem     for the safety of large groups is not a good idea. W is happy,     the worst that can happen is that he loses the odd stone, in     all probability he picks up yose as he goes.]
;B[kn];W[jm];B[km];W[jl];B[ij]C[djna - I don't know whether B needs this or not, I'm not sure B knows     whether his other group can live. All too tricky, B is on the back foot     because 59 tried to hang on to terrioiry.]
;W[kl];B[ko];W[fo];B[eo];W[fn];B[fm]C[djna - very bad, just play F10, there are very few points here, so hanging    on to them just causes problems later.]
;W[en];B[dn];W[em];B[fl];W[el];B[cl];W[fk];B[gl];W[gk];B[hk]
;W[ej];B[dh]C[Fedya: I think this is another mistake -- I should have played around M11 to try to get a second eye *somewhere in the middle. Or is that group already dead?        djna - allowing the group to get cut off is terrible unless you *know*     it's alive. If you now know it's dead you should resign. if you're     not sure then you should be looking after it; surely with one more move     W can kill it. Moves such as L12 will be big as yose anyway, so try them.]
;W[dg];B[eh];W[lh];B[nj];W[nh];B[hd];W[id];B[gc];W[he];B[hb]
;W[gd];B[fc];W[oi];B[oj]C[Fedya: I should probably have resigned already, since I'm not going to be able to make two eyes with the group in the center.]
;W[pi]C[djna - yes. I have not commented on any more of the game.]
;B[ib];W[cc];B[cb];W[bc];B[bb];W[eg];B[fg];W[fh];B[di]C[Fedya: This move was unnecessary, but I don't know if anything else would help anyhow.]

;W[mi];B[ni];W[oh];B[mj];W[pj]C[Fedya: I finally decided to resign since it was clear that no matter how much I tried, there was no way I was going to make two eyes in the center. But I think I would still have been behind even had I been able to save the group. White has too much territory on the right and in the top-center.]
