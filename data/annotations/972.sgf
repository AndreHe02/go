(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]C[12/22/99  caljp(25k*) vs loui (25k)

I lost by a big margin, but thought I played well in the beginning.  I think I know some points where I went wrong, but would like some suggestion please.

I believe that loui is much better than 25k while I consider my self around 27k

last note this was fast game, but i think the outcome would be similar.   Do you think beginners should play fast games?     JH: Hello!  I hope my comments will help you.   Unfortunately you gave me no hint on how long that game took, so I don't know what you mean with 'fast'. I think that you shouldn't play REALLY fast games. You should have the time to think a bit about your moves. Play at a steady pace. If you can't decide which move you should make: make one that doesn't look to bad. Everything from upwards 1 hour should be ok.

The important thing is that you should have a look at your game and analyse it. You can't improve if you reject to do this. Keep the moves where you felt unsure during the game in mind and find better alternatives in this analysis.

Remember: the goal is to improve, not necessarily to win. You will always loose some games by points. But a game is really lost if you can't learn something from it.

Let's have a look at your game.];PW[caljp]WR[25k*]PB[loui]BR[25k]KM[5.5]
HA[0]RE[B+Resign];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[fq];W[cn]C[JH: This move is ok. It is very solid (and defensiv). Another idea is D6 which puts more pressure on black. But that's a matter of taste. Make your own experiments.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]C[JH: With this move, the joseki is finished. Now it is your turn.

It is a very important situation. You have to decide whether you want to make a corner enclosure or approach (and where) one of the black starpoints.

It depends on your strategy. ;-)

I would prefer to make a corner encloser at P3 because a black approach there or one line higher would give your opponent a big advantage. (as you unfortunately will learn later)

Remember that it is very important to make corner enclosures or prevent the opponent from doing as soon as possible.]

(;W[nc]C[JH: The danger is that black could play a pincer around K16. This would develop his upperleft corner very beautiful.   Always watch out for such double-purpose moves.

Such a move for you could be the approach from the other side at R14. This stone would somehow be related to the stone in the lower right AND approach the corner.

But usualy you can wait with an approach to the 4-4 point (hoshi) and see how the game develops. After a few moves more it would become clear from which side to approach.]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[op]C[JH: Ouch! This is a very good move. Black will have the advantage because he has friends to the left and a strong position at the top to help this stone and profit from arising strength (walls) in the fight to come. This move is now even better than without the joseki at the top.]

(;W[mq]C[jp: i didn't want to let black to have a huge moyo on the bottom


JH: Don't panic!  You should think in another way. Don't be destructiv! To make a moyo black has to place more stones in this area. So you are able to place stones in an other area. In a balanced game, the result is then even. If one player gets something, the other player will get something too.

Of course this position favours black, but you can't change it by playing crude moves. Maybe you don't know this joseki? It is very likely that white will get a thick position that radiates strength to the left. But this strength is broken by the solid black position there. So this move is not good here and will only help black.

Imagine what will be if black cuts your two stones. You will have two very endangered stones. One pincered by a strong black position.

(see variations)];B[qo]C[JH: This is not joseki, but maybe playable. You see the idea. He wants to make strength that would be supported by the black group which resulted from your approach in the upper-right.]

(;W[ro]C[jp: the result from this exchange was disappointing.  Maybe p3 is better in hindsight?

JH: This is too submissive. P3 creates a lot of complications. Try some variations for aourself. Maybe you can cut through at Q5. (see variations)]
;B[pp];W[qn]C[JH: It is a good idea to break out.];B[po];W[qq];B[pq]
(;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[cf]C[JH: The focus of the game is at the lower right. Your plan to prevent black from building a moyo is in danger! Your lone white stone has to escape, but I fear that black will get a lot out of attacking it while escaping.

The problem is that you decided to take the corner. It is always a change. You take the corner - the opponent takes the influence. But taking influence greatly helped black in this position.]
;B[ch];W[ef];B[fd]
(;W[fh]C[jp: I'm not sure about this.  I didn't want to lose this group though, any suggestions?


JH: You can make your stones stronger by pressing and then counterattack.]
;B[ck]
(;W[bd]C[JH: Go on with your attack. Your group is not in real danger. Black has to worry about his two stones.]
;B[cc];W[hc];B[gc];W[hd]C[jp: slow I think.  maybe h15 or somewhere else?

JH: I think this move is ok in the local position. But there are more urgent moves to make. Attack the two black stones. Prevent black from making a moyo at the bottom.]
;B[bc]
(;W[bg]C[JH: This will chase black in the center. In this position it would be better to shut him in instead.]
;B[bh]C[JH: Hm. He should run in the center. Now you have another chance to shut him in.]

(;W[cg]C[JH: Not necessary. Don't defend every single stone. If you shut black in, he has to fight for his live and you will get a strong outside position as a base for a big moyo in the center.]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[cm];W[dm];B[dl];W[em];B[el];W[eq]C[JH: Your goal should be to shut in the black group on the left.]
;B[er];W[fp];B[gq];W[kq]C[jp: this is bad, but I knew I had to do something or black will have large territory on bottom.  i don't know how to handle this.


JH: You can't live here, so an extension to the side is pointless. Try to escape with a jump into the center if you want to play here.

But I would give up the single stone and press from the outside with a move around J5.]

And you lost a lot of stones...

(;W[ps];B[rs]C[jp: i resigned after this, i believed that the corner was dead, because black is so good at fighting.  Also the rest looks like endgame.  c11, h6 were my next candidates.    JH: It is ok to resign in this position.

Indeed black is better at fighting, what means that he is better in reading out positions. In the lower right you made some serious reading mistakes. You should improve your reading and do some problems. There a good problem books on the market. Solve a lot of problems!

An important concept of this beautiful game is balance. Keep this in mind and have another look at move 16.   Don't defend every stone. In a position where you are outnumbered you will only help your opponent. Instead threaten to save it from the outside or just leave it as it is. Maybe you can use it if the position around changes.

And I think your level is good enough to slowly start with learning some basic joseki.


I hope, you could use these comments. I would appreciate it, if you could send me some lines, wheter you liked this review or not.

Bye, Jorg.])
