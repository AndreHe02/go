C[Hello,

My name is Tim and I go by Talaer on KGS. I will do my best to review for you. I will let my notes starting with a T: and will try to include variations where necessary. Let me know if you have any questions! If you see me around on KGS, you can ask me for a game.

Thanks,
Tim

kazam [6k\]: hello, gg

Thanks for reviewing my game.];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[cn]
;W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[dj]C[T: This exchange is favorable toward black, because he gets a perfect extension.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qe]C[T: I am not so great with joseki but I believe W should play Q15 if he wanted to play this way. Black should probably come out ahead here too, because he will get incredibly thick influence here. Also, yes I agree that Q15 is the simple response.

----------

I have been surprised by this move and wsn't sure what to do with it... The very simple q15 would have already been better than what happened next! What do you think?]

(;B[pg];W[pe];B[oe];W[od]C[T: This appears to be too hard of a fight for B to win. It feels the only option is to attempt to live in the corner and keep W split.]
;B[nd];W[oc];B[nc];W[ne];B[of];W[pc]
(;B[mf]C[T: Agreed. The result with the ladder would probably be playable. The result after you get divided into pieces seems very difficult. W has a large corner here, but your influence spreads over much more of the board right now.

-------------

This move was very bad especially since the ladder works...]
;W[me]C[T: I'm not sure if much can be done to sacrifice those stones without leaving many weaknesses behind.]

(;B[ld];W[le];B[kd];W[nf];B[mg];W[ng];B[pi];W[ph];B[oh];W[qh]
;B[og];W[nh];B[ni];W[qi];B[pj];W[mh];B[kg]C[T: I'm not sure it is wise to keep those stones right now, anyway. Something like R10 is going to help you strengthen up significantly, then you can maybe worry about attacking those W stones.

;B[om]C[T: The lower left is pretty weak right now for W. It would likely survive an attack, but you could rob many points there with a move like E3. Likely there are possibilities in the lower right as well, but I'm far from a guru of the 4-4 point, and hence not intimately familiar with all of the invasion situations. However, when behind, aim to cause trouble!

-----------

I think I should have been more aggressive on the upper left group but did not know how.
Also, now I am well behind an was thinking on ays to catch up.I had no idea wher or how to invade and so went for reduction moves.]

;W[qo];B[pn];W[mp];B[mo];W[lo]C[T: W has sealed in another large corner while you've gained a few points. This is a side effect of the weak group created earlier in the game.]
;B[mn];W[nk];B[ql];W[rl];B[ok];W[qk]C[T: I'm not sure how much keeping R8 benefits you right now. Maybe cut off O9 or even M5.]

;B[nl];W[mj];B[jo];W[kp];B[jp];W[lq];B[kr];W[rk];B[pk];W[km]
;B[kn];W[jm];B[gj]C[T: This feels correctly timed given the circumstance. Of course, it also allows W to attack your bottom even harder.]

;W[ai];B[ah]C[This is my last blunder I ended up in a bad ko fight and since I was already well behind I resigned.]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[ag];B[aj];W[bj];B[ah];W[dm];B[cm];W[ai]C[T: This is one of those games that ended very early on. Once W was able to secure thick positions while giving you weak groups, he was able to control the game with a few decently placed moves. When moves arise like the one in the opening, you almost always need to play the nice, solid move that doesn't give them valuable cutting points, especially in the corner. When you make thick groups, you'll find you have a lot less to worry about, even if they aren't currently making any 'points'. I think you should go over some problems in spare time to improve tactics. If you have any more questions or would like for me to review any more specific parts of the game, let me know, either on KGS or via email (helxis@comcast.net). 

Thanks,
Tim

;W[sg]C[T: I'm not sure at this point if B should continue pushing, or extend toward K1. P12 is  a large point for either side right now, so it is probably the right move.]
