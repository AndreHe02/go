AB[pd][dp]C[Hi! Thanks for taking the time to do this review. I thought I played OK during this game, but I feel as if I could have made some better moves. - Canbek

MR: I put comments in the game every now and then, always starting with "MR". I also tried to comment on most of your questions in the file.

There are some questions of "direction of play" and, related to this, choice of joseki, in the first part of the game. 

Then there are some strange "attacks" in the middle game that do not work out and that strengthen the opponent and weaken yourself. Maybe here it is a question of taking the time to read more deeply in the position and to leave out moves that you can already determine that they do not work.

With respect to winning or loosing, even after you threw away some extra stones at the top, you were still ahead. But due to small mistakes here and there in the endgame you finally lost.]

(;B[fd]C[I don't know many joseki at all, maybe enough to count on my two hands, so I wasn't sure of the continuation here. Was this a good move?

MR: This is a matter of direction of play. Black would like to separate the white stone D11, so the "standard joseki" given in the variation should be fine for him.]
;W[df];B[dg];W[ef]
(;B[ce]C[MR: Not the usual continuation when there is a white stone at D11. See variations.]

;B[pr];W[jr];B[ir]C[MR: White is weak enough so that it is not necessary to give a ponnuki to him.]

(;B[do]C[MR: ? 
I do not understand the aim of this move. It neither secures the corner nor does it attack the white groups.]
;W[ck]C[MR: Now white is rather stable on both sides.];B[cm]
C[MR: What is the goal of this "attack"? Black is rather weak at the bottom left, and with this and the following moves, black is just strengthening white while weakening black.]
;W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[bk];W[dn];B[cj];W[dk];B[fo]C[MR: Now white can capture the C7 stones. The "attack" has failed.]

What is the aim of this move? Eye spending tesuji? White is alive, so you should not play inside the white group.]

;B[hm];W[fl];B[hl];W[fj];B[hj]C[I felt bad after playing this move because immediately afterwards I thought, "N16 was the move!" White didn't take long to capitalize.

MR: You cannot get everything ;-) 015 is the "normal" move on the top right to expand the black position.]
;W[ne];B[ok]C[Too slow?

MR: I personally would say so. But although you played that tightly, white managed to live within the black area ... (although he shouldn't)]
;W[mk]
(;B[kk]C[MR: ? 
You need to think about whether you want to try to cut off the white stone N10.
This is definitely neither the direction to make territory nor the direction to attack the white stone.]
