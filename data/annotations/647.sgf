;B[rh];W[qg]C[This connection leaves white with a very "heavy" group- these 4 stones are going to have difficulty making eyes!]
;B[of]C[Wrong direction. Better to connect your weakness at q11 or simply defend the corner at r16, driving him out into the centre. You don't have to kill a weak group to profit from it! :-)]
;W[oh];B[pi];W[og];B[oi];W[ni];B[nh];W[ng];B[mh];W[mg];B[mi]
;W[lh];B[nj];W[lf];B[kg]C[This move is called a "raw peep" and is regarded as almost always bad. The stone played is very weak and not helping you to make territory. Compare  a play at or around n16- attacking the weak group, but also mapping out territory.]
;W[lg];B[ke];W[ki];B[li];W[kh];B[jh]C[Too close & too thin. White can cut at k13 and capture, making his group safer. Try a big strategic move like c10, or play safer at k13 if you want to play in this area.]
;W[ji];B[jg]C[Black now has thickness (a strong group with no weaknesses to easily attack) facing towards the upper left. The whole area could become his.]
;W[ij]C[This is bad shape- k8 makes the group safe in one move.]
;B[gk]C[This attack is misguided. Black is a long way ahead, and it's time to play the huge move around c10/d10.]
;W[il]C[This makes the white group safe at last, though k8 makes better shape!]
;B[ik]C[This is an overplay. Black will form a heavy group if he connects out of the coming atari, and will make the white group safe while being attacked himself.]
;W[jk];B[hk];W[ii]C[White missed an opportunity to start attacking the weak group black gave himself by his overplay at j9. Try g11 instead.]
;B[kj];W[jl]C[This defends well against the cut at k10];B[lj]
C[A lighter move around L8 keeps more pressure on the running group, defends the cut at m10 and prepares to invade the bottom edge.]
;W[jj];B[kl]C[Contact plays like this usually strengthen your opponent, giving him weak stones to attack to get out of trouble. It's better here to play around g12 to prevent an escape in that direction, and give you a large potential area.]
;W[km];B[lk]C[This is bad shape. n8 is much better, the "bamboo joint"- a strong connection that cannot be cut.]
;W[jn];B[im]C[This move is played in the heat of battle, expecting a connection at k7. White should simply play h7 and swallow this stone, and any others added to it! :-)]
;W[jm]C[But he doesn't!];B[hm];W[jp];B[mo];W[mp];B[np];W[nq]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[oq];W[pq];B[op];W[lq]C[Should be at o2, the n3 stone dies and white secures the bottom.]
;B[nr];W[lo];B[lm];W[po];B[pn];W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[mn]C[r6, threatening to take the corner territory away, is stronger.]
;W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[ql];W[om];B[pl];W[qo]C[White & black both safe, time to take a big point somewhere else- g12, for instance!]
;B[nl];W[ol];B[ok];W[rl];B[qk];W[rk];B[rj];W[rm]C[Unnecessary. There are some huge points elsewhere! Look for them when the game goes quiet! :-)]
;B[pr];W[qr];B[qs];W[rq]C[s2 better];B[rr];W[qq];B[ps]C[This is an endgame sequence, too small to be played out so early.]
;W[gp];B[ls];W[jr];B[js];W[is];B[ks];W[hr];B[ho];W[hp];B[ip]
;W[iq]C[j5 correct to punish the overplay.];B[io];W[jo];B[fp]
;W[fq];B[go];W[ep];B[fo];W[eq];B[do];W[eo];B[en];W[co];B[dn]
;W[cn];B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[bn]C[Should be at c7, sacrificing 2 stones to wall White in.]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[dm];B[el];W[bo];B[bm];W[ap];B[bl];W[em];B[fn]
C[D8 is much bigger!];W[dl];B[dk];W[hh]C[The cut at f9 would endanger the whole lower .L central group]
;B[hg];W[gh];B[hi]C[This is very dangerous! White doesn't need to connect. He can push through at h10 & the group below could be in serious trouble!]
;W[ih];B[fi];W[fh];B[eg];W[eh];B[dh];W[fg];B[ef];W[lr]C[Another endgame move. The top left is most important.]
;B[mr];W[kr];B[ms];W[ff];B[gf]C[should be at f15. The territory above is far more important than a stone or two!]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[fd];B[gd];W[fc];B[ec];W[gc];B[hc];W[eb];B[db]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[ga];B[hb];W[fa]C[n16 is the key point now.];B[ha]
;W[da];B[ca];W[ea];B[cb];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe]C[r17 now takes the whole corner!]
;W[rf];B[rd];W[me];B[md];W[le];B[ne];W[ld];B[mc];W[lc];B[lb]
;W[nf];B[od]C[should be at r17];W[pf];B[qc];W[oe];B[nd];W[of]
;B[kc];W[ig];B[if];W[kf];B[jf];W[kd];B[je];W[gi];B[fj];W[hj]
;B[gj]C[Not needed. e11 bigger.];W[jd];B[id];W[ee];B[de];W[ei]
;B[ej];W[di];B[dj];W[ci];B[ch];W[cj];B[ck];W[dg]C[c13, giving up 2 stones, is correct here. Your territory will melt away if you don't!]
;B[df];W[cg];B[bh];W[bg];B[bf];W[bi];B[ah];W[ai];B[af];W[ag]
;B[cf];W[bk];B[ak];W[bj];B[fk]C[f7 better.];W[aj];B[al];W[fm]

;B[gs];W[gr];B[gq];W[hq];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt];C[You show a lot of promise! Some pointers-   1. You were well ahead for most of the game, playing safe, big, territory oriented moves is right when you are ahead.   2. Try to avoid fighting on in the same area without thinking. Take a deep breath and think about playing a big move elsewhere.

3. Keep enjoying yourself! :-)
