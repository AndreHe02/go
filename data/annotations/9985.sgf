C[Hi,

I played as white and lost this game. I did a big reading mistake at the end of the game but I think I was already behind.
Unfortunately, I can't find the weakness in my game and it's here I'll need your help.

I add some comments in the game to show what I was thinking.

Thanks];B[qe];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[pc]
(;W[qo]C[I think from opening theory, it's the biggest point but I'm not sure it's not a trick according the top left corner. Do you know ?

Hi, I'm Ginno on Kgs, 2kyu.
Here the last B move can allow a  nice 'box' shape if he plays around k16 then. So you want to prevent B to do this and play yourself around K16.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[pp]C[Basic joseki, s3 variation would be painful I think but let's continue

your choice is good];B[oq];W[rq];B[fq]C[Works well with the right... I should pincer I think

G: W would want to play on the right side also to settle its group]

(;W[iq]C[G: The pincer makes your stone between a stronger group on the right, and a stone f3 that can jump, so your pincer will have to run most likely...
You better settle your corner and then reduce the bottom Black side]

(;B[kq]C[G: B should rather play form it's weaker stone since O4 is rather strong]
;W[io]
(;B[cq]C[G/ Here you give W a separation of your stones in 2 groups that will have to make life and help W make strength at the same time]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]
(;W[fp]C[maybe too early ?

G: t preventiveyou have 2 stones on the right, so they will help you. Now you are overconcentrated, compared to W e17 instead]
;B[ql]C[G: W needs to settle its group now, and not to counter attack]

(;W[qj]
(;B[qh];W[oj];B[ol];W[on]C[wanted to cut and build at the top in the remaining fight

G/ I don't understand, to cut what?  
you mean to make p8 run? But your q4 group isn't really alive and your p10 either, so you're the one who will have to run x2]

(;W[rl];B[rk];W[sm];B[qk]C[but the cut did not work as well as I wanted, even with my nice poniki facing the center. But I'm still thinking it could be attacked easily so I add a move]

(;W[ll]C[sente ?

G: not sente, and overconcentrated, but a move is useful - though not necessary.  Maybe better towards the empty part of the board : o13, &/or jump further L11]
;B[cf]C[no :(];W[fc]C[I think the other side would have been better as black build the left side

G: yes, but notice that w center group can reduce the potential of the top side]
