C[Hello, all criticisms are welcome. In particular, I  am interested in comments on fuseki and the  opening sequences (the thinking behind them).  I would like to get a sense of the differences in  thinking and strategizing between me and a  stronger player.   Thanks in advance!

I am new at reviewing games and will try my  best.  I would not try the variation trees but simply put in comments.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[dj];W[dm];B[cf];W[ch]TR[cf][dj]C[what do you think of this move?
With the two marked B stones in this shape,  W c12 is often a good invasion point (given good follow-up). However, I think when W d16 is pretty lonely there, c12 may not be that great.  It encourages B to e14 which W would need to respond to pretect D16.  Then w c12 could be easily swollen.]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[eh];W[mp]TR[dm][dp]C[N4 is a good move in relation with the marked stones.
At this point, I would strengthen white d16 a bit.  Or B somewhere at g16 could give w a lot a presure and b could gain a lot by drawing back at r16. Always watch out for your own weak groups subject to attack.]
;B[qn]C[is black's response okay?
I think black's response is good and is the usual move.];W[jq]
;B[jd]C[i think B could go closer to the w d16 to give pressure.]
;W[md]C[d16 needs help.
you seem to like to go between b stones :)
I'd somehow like to go in the bigger space on the right side.  R11 for example, to allow myself to go for a 2-space extension on either side and live.
Or, instead of your N16, i'd go O16 (a closer corner approach and a lower move).  Normally, b would protect the corner. then w can L17 to build a base.]
;B[nc]C[see, w N16 forced b to strenghen corner and w now looks a bit awkward.]
;W[mc];B[nd];W[kb];B[jc];W[mf]C[I have created a weak group. How should I  have gone about attacking black's right side?]
;B[jf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[fe];W[pj]C[good thinking to get into the right side before it's too late.  but when there is such a big space, i'd try to go on 3rd line and build base (territory).  R11 or R12 for example.]
;B[ph]C[pretty convenient for black, his corner even bigger.]
;W[oh];B[og];W[nh];B[ne];W[me];B[nn]C[what do you think of black's move?
If i were black, i'd probably go r9 to build territory as well as threathening to conect with Q12 group.]
;W[oo]C[W P5 cannot cause too much harm.   I think it's time for w to strenthen the lower left corner, it's big for both b and w.  W could  go E3 (secures the corner better) or F3.  It's huge.]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[oq];W[no];B[on];W[ql];B[pi];W[oj];B[pl];W[pk]
C[Result of w Q10, w didn't gain as much as b did.
i think here w r10 is bigger than Q9];B[jn];W[fl];B[hp];W[jp]
;B[io];W[ln];B[ko];W[lo];B[hl];W[lk]C[lower left corner have been left open for too long! (for both players)]
;B[kl];W[ml];B[lm];W[ol]C[and also, w B17 or H17,  would be bigger then the last couple of white moves.]
;B[pm];W[mn];B[kn];W[mm];B[po];W[fj];B[hj];W[di];B[ei];W[ej]
C[that's huge also for white, good move.];B[fi];W[cj];B[gj]
;W[jj];B[ii];W[jl];B[kk];W[kj];B[jk];W[kh];B[jh];W[kf];B[jg]
;W[kg];B[gd];W[hc]C[Is it worth it to try and connect the two white  groups?

If both groups are alive, connection is just points.  Yes, it's many points.]

C[b14 is small and gote!  lower corner much more urgent.];B[be]
;W[ag];B[cd];W[dc];B[dq];W[eq];B[ep];W[cq];B[fq];W[dr];B[fp]
C[you were lucky that b let you still keep the big corner.  black would have been better off to live in the corner. I think he could have.]

i like h2 better. h3 gote. (b j3, w j2, b connect, w has to h2)]

;B[rr]C[necessary?
no.];W[gl];B[hm];W[rj];B[hk];W[fk];B[mr];W[lr];B[nr];W[ip]C[good forcing move.]

;B[sp];W[sn];B[rp]C[white should watch out for this T6 group shape, alway think what b could do if he ataris at T8.  in this case, b atari at t6 and then could connect a t10. many points!]
;W[qc]C[Is an invasion here even possible? Is there a  rule of thumb for deciding?
hard to live when b has thick walls all around.  i've seen w plays r16 to create confusion.]

It's a good game.  i had fun reviewing.])
