C[I played at white. I think my biggest problem was failing to reduce Black's framework enough. I just didn't know how to reduce Black's and increase mine, this is what I would like help with. Thanks.

djna: Thanks for letting me look at this game. I'm going to start by saying that this style of game is one that I personally tend to avoid. Competing moyos are hard to manage. Aome ideas about taht later.

My major comment about W's play is that he tending to play too many single purpose moves in the opening. The 3-3 point move being a particularly noticable example.

B played some slow moves and gave W some oopportunties to take important points. He also created a snake when perhaps simply solifdifying territory was better.

I have put a variation quite early, because I want to suggest one approach which W may consider. 

Thanks,
Dave (djna)];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq]

djna: W can choose a whole different style of game instead of this. See the variation for a "cunning plan".


What's happening here is that W is choosing to play a "competing moyo" game.

Now my personal prejudice is that W is at a disadvantage in such games, B has the initiative and his moyo will tend to be a step ahead. Hence I tend to try other ideas.

The key thing in this game is that W's positional judgement has to be very good. Do you estimate scores as you go? Use them to decide if to invade or reduce? decide how to handle your opponents invasions. Personally I find that quite difficult. 

So, my thinking is:

a). To win a game today maybe a different plan might be  better.

b). To get stronger tomorrow play like this, but be prepared to work hard at areas that mnay people find less fun, such as counting and estimating.]
;B[qk];W[ck];B[jp];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[po]C[

djna: my feeling is that B should play in the center.

Generally in games like this playing points that grow both sides frameworks are very urgent.

Theory of moyos

1). You want your opponent to invade, then you solidifiy territory while chasing him. henc Q5 is perhaps preamture. We welcome the lonely W stone there.

2). Invade just before it's too late! Maybe you actually nearly did that :-)]
;W[do]C[

djna: to my eyes too single purpose. Prefer center.];B[gq]C[

djna: feels very slow - W has the chance to be active.];W[cc]
C[

djna: I see this bad for two reasons:

1). You have a framework around the 4-4 point. The meaning of the 4-4 point is face outwards. You want W to invade at 3-3 and by the time he's lived you have 30 points on the out side.

Natural developments from 4-4 should focus on buildind the demawork on the outside.

2). It's single purpose. If W goes around playing single purpose moves he leaves  initiative with  B

Play K10 it is more consistent with the meaning of your previous moves. gives support for future reductions]
;B[pb];W[gd]TR[lc]C[

djna: if W wants to strengthen anything then perhaps he needs to worry about the marked invasion.

But overall both players seem to have lost the thread of their moyo strategies. One should not try to convert moyos directly to territory.

I would still be playing in the middle,];B[jj]LB[lc:A][me:E]
[dh:D][dj:C][cm:B][go:F]TR[kh][mh][oh][qh]SQ[qf][lj][nj][jn]
C[

djna: So B does play there. I feel as W that we are now in some difficulties.

At this point imagine taht you succesfully  establish one W group somewhere in B's framwork. Say  somewheere along the traingles line. In exchange B plays somwhere near the squares.

I estimate that B can easily solidify over 70 points, even if he allows W to live somehere in teh bottom right..

I reckon that W can count on 25 at  the bottom left and 35 at the top. I'm assuming that W can't get much around A and chas plenty of invasion/reduction moves around B,C and D .

The overall effect now is that each move B adds to his framework grows points quickly. Imagine B at E or F.]
;W[eh]LB[pg:B][lj:E][pj:A][pn:D][pr:C]C[

djna: compare the scale of this with B's last move.

Worse, consider what B can do next!

I don't see how to win from here, but as W I would start to confuse the issue.

For example stones around any the letterd places might lead to some fun.

I think I'd play E and see what happens, B and D work better is E as a ladder breaker is available.

Hopefully B will get obsessed with looking after his centre stone.]
;B[me]C[

djna: see how active this is in comparison wuith W's previous move.]
;W[lc]LB[nc:A]C[perhaps I should have played less defensive moves?

djna: Yes, you just have no time to argur over the fate of  A,

that's a 10 ooints or so under discssion, meawhile the B moyo is grwoing at 20 points a move.]
;B[kf];W[jm]LB[eh:B][dj:C][ck:A]C[This doesn't seem right, but I couldn't see what else to do. I knew I needed to somehow reduce or invade Black's framework.


djna: I think it's just too late. B can solidify the whole top right now and W's territoy still needs some attention, the A-B relationship is not secure, I don't see a great response to C for example.


I've tried to find alternatives, but not come up with anything useful.]
;B[gm]C[
djna: this is cheeky by B, I don't think he needs to do this to win, but it is the logical use of his framework.

I actually really like this move, wish I could have thought to play it!]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[hk];B[fk]LB[fl:A]TR[hk][ik][jm]C[
djna: B is following theory,  chase you into your own territory,
but is he being over ambitiuous?

slight glimmer of hope? can cut at A be made to work?

Right now the fate of the marked stones is too important..]
;W[gj]LB[kk:C][kl:D][jm:E][kn:B][go:A]TR[fk][gm]C[

djna: the game is now quite tricky.

W's reducing group is pretty much out.

The two B stones are some what vulnerable to attack.

Consider moves such as A.

B though can see weaknesses in W's position on the left and also has huge moves such as B, C and D. Could that E stone be cut off?]
;B[fj]C[

djna: forceful idea, B really needs to be sure he has a plan.]
;W[gi];B[fi];W[fh]LB[dj:B][kl:A][go:E][hp:C][hq:D]C[

djna: I think B is getting carried away here.


This is where score estimation becomes very important.

What's the score if B plays A and W protects at B?

Also, does B have any anaswer to W C, B D, W E?

As B I would be playing E.];B[cj]C[
djna: this looks like a nice way to use the strenght but has a terribler outcome!]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[ch]C[
djna: suddenly W is getting to play both sides.];B[bh];W[bi]
;B[bj];W[ci];B[bl]TR[fi][fj][fk][gm]C[

djna: the result over the next few moves is not too good for B. But we can see this as W just solidifying territory he already staked out. It's not a devastating turn aorund.

Getting the whole marked group would have been the ideal.];W[cm]

C[
djna: B helped W a lot here, free gifts of stones, but the overall linkage is OK and B still has sente.]
;B[hf]C[

djna: sente against the cut, so could be nice timing];W[gf]
LB[hd:C][ge:B][gg:A]TR[lp][op]SQ[ok]C[
djna: protecting the cut, but leaving aji. B at A may be annoyingbecause it has follow ups.

Perhaps better to connect solidly, pay the debt now rather than later.


However, I think you have no time to be correct. B's next move is just too big. So instead do something wild.

Some thoughts:

That B group on the left is still not quite solid.

Could we play somwhere at the bottom (triangles) and establish a group. By the time B protects his own group maybe we have a foothold?

Can we reduce the side a bit first? Cap the side, gives us a place to run towards?]
;B[kl]C[

djna: surely enough to win];W[km];B[ll];W[lm]C[

W is hampered by needing to protect the cut.];B[lp];W[jl];B[nl]
C[
djna: B is solid, all weaknesses now covered.

I see this as game over.

Later, move 92, there's an attempt to live in the top, but this should never work, by then  B is way too strong in the area.

A professional game, 63rd Honinbo title match, game 3. 

W is Hane Naoki
B is Honinbo Takao Shinji

W plays immediate approach, intent is to disrupt B's building his mojo.

If you want to get into a different kind of game then this is one idea.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]C[now a possibly surprsing action by W ...]
;W[cp]C[leaves the joseki unfinished and takes the empty corner

B has many possible choices, but does the obvious thing.];B[pn]

"punishes" the imcomplete W shape];W[iq]C[and W ignores again!

Note that B has built thickness and W has erased it.

I like this for W.];B[qm];W[dj]C[

So now W has developed very quickly at the expense of giving B about 20 points solid territory.


Now, later W actually loses this game, but the players say that a mistake later in the fuskei is the reason for that. B invaded at  the bottom left and W did not find the right annswer.]
