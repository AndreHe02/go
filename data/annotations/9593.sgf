C[Hello Ramon. I'm BruceWayne on KGS and am happy to provide this review.]
;B[pd];W[pq]TR[po][qo]C[this is a bit of a philosophical point, but this is a bad move because it is playing away from the black star point, making a black approach here ideal for black.]
;B[cd];W[dp];B[ic]TR[po][qo]C[the chinese opening is fine, but i still think the board is screaming for black to approach here]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[pi];B[qn];W[ed];B[dc];W[ce]
(;B[be];W[dd];B[cf];W[cc];B[de];W[db]C[up to here white is successful in creating a live shape within blacks territory. if i was black, i would have tried to play lighter, or to create outside thickness as in the variations.]
;B[bc];W[ec];B[cb]C[unnecessary move. white is correct to tennuki]
;W[jp];B[ff];W[hc];B[id];W[hb];B[ib];W[dc];B[bb];W[fb];B[ri]
TR[cn][dn]C[why are you so eager to play here? your lone stone is not in danger yet and the biggest spot on the board is on the left, extending from your thickness]
;W[rh];B[qh];W[rg];B[qi];W[rc];B[rb];W[cn]C[with this move, white has greatly reduced the effectiveness of the black group in the upper left. this should have been blacks approach here]

;B[fp];W[hp];B[gn];W[ho];B[pf]LB[pf:A]TR[rc][rd][qf][rg][rh]
[fm]C[I think my move at A was premature, but think this group is weak and I'm not really sure how to attck it, or take advantage of the group weakness.

reinforce your own weak groups before thinking about attacking.]

(;B[cl]LB[cl:A]TR[cj][bn][cn][bo]C[Again, I feel this white group is weak and relative to the strength of my surounding stones I should be able to take advantage of this group; but I'm not really sure how to do so.

you need to think bigger picture. don't try to get points from killing, but rather from attacking! see variation.]

)
(;B[ej];W[dl];B[fl]C[see how these two simple moves attack and create a huge moyo in the middle? this is the strategy of attacking. now white has to worry about your center territory, and he still is not even alive yet on the left! your attacks should ALWAYS have this double goal thought in mind. get it?]
