;B[pp]C[Hello, I'm around 20 kyu
And i'd really like some advice on my game.
i lost by about 30 points, certaintly not my worst loss but i would like some general tips and some solutions to some of the problems i found in this game. -- thanks


Hi, 
I play news2u on IGS at 11K,
thanks for leting me review the game. I'll give some comments throughout with suggestions for better play,]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pc]C[atosi: Thank you for the game.];B[jp];W[pe]
;B[pj];W[cn];B[cp]MA[co]LB[cl:A][ck:B]C[I haven't seen many people play that, its weird, its seem strong but slow to me


news: it's not the usual response. A move at X is more common, or a pincer around A or B can work as well.
Joseki books will give you the variations.];W[en]LB[ck:A][cj:B]
[cn:1]C[i felt that this would an appropiate response to his last move. Though looking back seeing as how i let this group die perhaps i should have followed up on this move


news: actually, this is a weak move. Black's corner stones have the beginnings of a solid base, so you need to give your stones a base as well - a move at A or B is needed. If black plays at one of these spots instead, which he eventually does, your stones end up floating in the middle. If the purpose of Move 1 was to establish yourself on the side, then the follow up is necessary]
;B[gq]
(;W[jd]MA[dj]C[see my idea for variation

news: your variation move at X would have helped give those two white stones a base. 
Try to make the most urgent move first.
Your current move at K16 is a good move, but giving the two white stones around D6 a basae is even more important.]
;B[gd]C[this guy plays weird again. it's looks to me like  he threw that stone into a kind of pincer. (I never was any good at making pincers work to my advantage)

news: yes, with the left side still wide open, there are better moves than this. It seems aimless.]
;W[df]C[this just felt okay

news: yes, this is OK, it develops the corner towards the open side, and by strengthening the two white stones puts pressure on the black invading stone.]
;B[ec];W[cc]MA[dc]C[News: I would have played at X to keep maximum pressure on black and give him as little room to move as possible.]
;B[dc]C[i wanted to cap B13 but i didn't want to give up too much of the side eitheir]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[pm]TR[qn][qq][nq]MA[dj]C[I try copying his weird move

News: There two problems here, first, it's not the biggest move on the board. A move at X would stake out the entire left side for you. Second, if you want to invade, then Q7 is not the best point.  Any of the triangled squares are better and make it easier to survive. There are many variations depending on blacks responses, so check out some invasion techniques online or in books.]
;B[mp];W[qo];B[qp];W[qk];B[qj]C[i might be mistaken but i think that move of his worked out better for me here]
;W[rp]C[I made a mistake, it seems a little slow

news; it is a little slow, but helps give you a living shape so your group can survive.]
;B[rq];W[ro];B[rk];W[rl];B[pk];W[ql];B[sk];W[nm]C[news: jumping out into the centre here is a good move. Try not to let your groups get shut in.]
;B[ri];W[qg]C[after i played here it seemed kind of off because i knew this guy was going to play right under me

news: that's fine. He seems to have a living group and you are consolidating the corner. There seem to be larger moves, though, like N16 or D10. Even C10, undercutting his group's potential eye space, look better. A move around K14 looks dangerous as well, threatening to lock up a huge chunk of territory. Your two stones in the corner, around Q16 aren't in danger, so rather than defend, try to expand other areas. Look for the biggest move.]
;B[rg];W[rf];B[qh];W[pg];B[ph];W[oh];B[oi];W[nh];B[ld];W[nd]
C[he jumps right in yet again I try to deal with it as best i can

news: He was rash here, and you should be able to kill him, but the variations are numerous. Cutting under him at N17 seems stronger.]
;B[lc];W[lf]C[I realize now that i made a pretty crummy mistake here.

news: this gives him a chance to live on the side, but you confine him and make a wall on the outside. By strengthening your group around K16, you will be able to put more pressure on his group at G17, which is still floating without definite eyeshape.]
;B[nb];W[ke];B[nc];W[oc];B[ob];W[hn];B[jn];W[gf];B[hd];W[ic]
;B[hf];W[jl]MA[gg][cb][hb]C[news: this move is kind of aimless. It doesn't consolidate the centre because it is still too open, and it doesn't put pressure on his groups.
Since his group at the top is running for the centre, keep the pressure on that first, say with G13, or undercutting with C18 or H18.
moves that put pressure on your opponent and force them to react are strong.]
;B[ge];W[gg];B[dj];W[dh];B[cl]MA[ci][dl]C[news: undercutting him at c11 carves into eyespace, but its slow, D8 is more aggressive and black will probably live in the coming battle, but white will gain a lot of strength.]
;W[dn]C[this move seems inappropiate

news: yes, the stones are effectively connected. This is a good chance to attack black's invasion and gain power in exchange.]
;B[fj];W[ci];B[cj];W[dl];B[di];W[ch];B[dk]C[right about here my stones seemed to be under pressure]
;W[el];B[cm];W[bj];B[bk];W[bn];B[bi];W[bh];B[aj];W[ej]C[news: blaack has already won the battle to live here, so trying to cut him like this fails. This makes him stronger and begins to threaten your stones around E6. A move like G9 connects your stones to the outside and prevents them getting cut off later.]
;B[ek];W[ei];B[fl];W[fi];B[hg];W[hh];B[cb]C[news: C 18 is a large move. Imagin a white stone there instead. Now imagine a black stone attacking at C16. This move requires a response.]
;W[gj];B[fk];W[fp]C[i figure that i don't like how much side he has and how much little room my group has so i try and make some, at this point i think my group has a decent chance of living]
;B[fq];W[ep];B[eq];W[hp];B[hq];W[ip];B[iq];W[io]C[news: these are small moves that only help black consolidate his territory]
;B[jo];W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq];W[po];B[pb];W[qq]C[stupid mistake, i saw it going differently in my mind]
;B[pq];W[qr];B[rr];W[qb]C[news: better, a much bigger move.]
;B[jb]C[i think after b113 that group was defiantly alive];W[ib]
;B[jc];W[ig]C[news: You must connect at J16];B[if];W[jg];B[bc]
;W[cd]C[news: unfortunately, black was able to play these moves in the corner before you. These moves could be worth about 15 points - they are quite large, plus, if you had stolen the corner, it could have put bressure on black to find enough room to live.]
;B[bd];W[be];B[ed];W[ee];B[kd];W[je];B[fe];W[ff];B[gb];W[id]
C[news: finally someone took it. He could have grabbed this many times.]
;B[he];W[mo];B[lp];W[lo];B[kp];W[lm];B[hk];W[gk];B[gl]
(;W[hl]C[my failure to make a connection  to the group  was terrible

news: yes, you are too weak on the bottom to try to cut him off. a move like H7 or J7 looks more promising, connect and living.]
;B[hm];W[il];B[im]C[right around here i really should have read farther ahead, if i did i probably would have snacthed two eyes.]

- - thanks again for your help.


news: You played an OK game, but here's a few pointers for getting better:

- it's important to make your groups stable before moving on somewhere else. For example, your large group that was cut off and killed in the end should have lived. There were many chances earlier in the game for you to make the group live. Making a small move to make ensure a group is alive is a large move.

- make the largest move. For example, had you played C18 before black, the corner would have been yours and black would have struggled to stay alive, moves like that are bigger than they look.

- regarding that same black group, for a long time it was simply four stones floating in the middle. When your opponent has weak stones, use the chance to attack them. Your opponent may live, but your stones on the outside will get stronger.

you understand living shapes quite well, so try to focus for a while on using stones to build outside influence, letting your opponent live small while building a large outside influence and potential territory.

hope this helps,
if you have any other questions feel free to ask,])
(;AW[im]C[i meant to connect this way]))
(;AW[dj]C[maybe that? i don't know, i was just so unhappy about losing this group]
