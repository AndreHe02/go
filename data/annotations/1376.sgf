AB[pd][dp]C[I played black in this game.
Despite the fact that I captured two black groups, I ended losing the game.
Pls tell me where did I go wrong...
Thanks...

Hello there, Zaher.  I'll do my best to point out anything that deserves it.  Any variations I added are noted with a *.]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[jd];B[qk]TR[qc]C[This is interesting.  One thing I've noticed in pro games is that they often forego playing the marked stone to play around K4.  The point of the chinese opening is speed anyways.  With this move order I'd like that.  Say you R9 instead of R17.  W is likely to K4, and you can approach the top left.  I feel that is superior, but that is more my opinion than anything else :)  Another idea is to R14 instead of Q14, and then Q9 instead of R9.  That feels a little more stable, and works more with D4.  The important thing, though, is to play how you feel comfortable.]
;W[jp];B[dj];W[fq];B[dn];W[dr]C[Well white has made this shape twice now, so I hope you are doing some thinking about it at this point.  It is not a standard shape, so there must be some weaknesses you can take advantage of.  We'll talk about this position later when you make your move of N15.]
;B[cq];W[nq];B[oo]LB[po:a][ok:b]C['a' is absolutely the appropriate move.  This is the perfect development move for the chinese opening, the next move as far as shape is concerned being 'b'.  When you play at 'a', you are strong and can look forward to playing M3.   The reason your move is bad is that it is a halfway measure, trying to do more than it can.  Play strong; it may look slow, but patience is a virtue.]
;W[rq]C[I was not sure how to respond to this kind of move. I tried to attack it by keeping it separated from o3

Good motive by white, looking towards the weak connection between your two stones.  Keeping his stones separated is the right idea.  Your other option is to allow him to connect and become thick towards to top.  Separating is a better idea, but it's best always to come up with a few options and think about them.]

(;B[pp]TR[oo]C[This isn't a good connection move.  It doesn't use your stones effectively.  The marked stone might as well not be here in this shape.  Very often it is more important to use your stones effieciently than to get what you want.  Since the marked stone is somewhat awkwardly placed, it may be tough to find a good shape, but since white's move doesn't seem natural, we may have a chance. *]
;W[qo]C[The other bad thing about your last play is white gets this lovely point.]
;B[pn]LB[om:a][pm:b]C[Too tight, 'a' or 'b' make for better shape and relate with R9 better.]
;W[lq]C[Overplay by white.]
(;B[qn]C[The corner is where the eyes are. *];W[qr];B[pr];W[ro]
;B[rn];W[sr];B[cf]LB[po:a]C[Your shape in LR is still not good, and there is the risk of a cut at 'a'.  However, Up to now you've kept the initiative, and are in a good position overall.]
;W[cd];B[me]LB[ef:a]C[I am not sure this is a good move, especially that I end up in Gote.

'a' is so proper it's not really worth thinking about another move.]
;W[md];B[nd]LB[lf:a][le:b]C[Think about maybe 'a' or 'b' instead?  They secure the connection just as well, but in a bigger and more menacing way.  More likely a sente way too.]
;W[mc];B[ne];W[df]C[John likes moyos, I know, but C12 is more meaningful with the strong corner.]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[cg];W[cl]C[What is the best way to respond to this invasion?

The main reason it is tough to respond to this is that you didn't play E14... Funny, huh?  You lost the option to push this stone into the center, and now you are pressured.]

(;B[el]C[A little too loose, but basically the right idea now. *]
;W[bn]LB[dk:a]C[White needs to play at 'a' first.]
(;B[cr]C[You had a golden opportunity here. *

This move is gote, and doesn't relate much to the fight above.]
;W[bp];B[cm];W[bm];B[dl];W[ck];B[cj];W[bj];B[bi];W[bk]LB[dk:a]
C[Good work in becoming thick.  You didn't get as much as you deserved, but your result is fine.  The cutting point at 'a' is unsettling, though.]

(;B[fc]C[thia is a probably an overplay.
Is there a better invasion point..
How about H17

H3!  You played C2, so follow it up!  H4 is also nice, or even K6, which looks at the center and would help H3 or H4 tremendously.]
;W[hc];B[db];W[cb];B[ce];W[ec]
(;B[ln]C[Your invasion stones aren't with aji, but probably is best to tenuki for now. *

I can't say enough about K6, a much more globally oriented move.]
;W[qh]C[another bold invasion.
What is the best way to respond?

You respond to this invasion rather well.  You keep him out of the center, where all your stones are facing.]
;B[pi];W[rf];B[rd];W[rj]C[As white finds out in the game, this shape doesn't really make eye space very well.]
;B[rk];W[ri];B[qg];W[ph];B[oh];W[og];B[oi];W[rg];B[sh]LB[qi:a]
[ng:b]C[You don't need to play here to kill, because if white playes here, you can play at 'a' and vice versa.  A simple play at 'b' gives you better outside shape than you get in the game.]
;W[pg];B[qf];W[of];B[mg];W[ng];B[mi];W[mf];B[mh];W[lf];B[nf]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[oe];B[od];W[re];B[qd];W[qb];B[le];W[kf];B[qi]
;W[sd];B[rh];W[sb];B[rb];W[ra];B[rc];W[oc];B[nh]C[This is a sin!  You had 4 liberties!  Playing anywhere else would be better.  If you were feeling very sure of yourself, a move at F10 would be like slapping your opponent in the face, as he obviously wants to attack to make up his loss.  It's a good time to work with your two invasion stones after that.]
;W[jl];B[hp]C[K6 is SOOOO right.  You are leading slightly, and you don't want extra complications.]
;W[fo];B[hn];W[fm];B[hl];W[hq];B[gn]C[??? This is just heavy!]
;W[fn];B[gp]C[This is sort of reasonable, but still real heavy.]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[fr];B[co];W[bo];B[gr];W[cn];B[en];W[cp];B[ep]
;W[dq]C[Huge.  Those peeps on the outside gave these stones to your opponent, along with about a zillion points.

a zillion?  Well, losing that corner altogether was worth about 20 points, and before H4, white's bottom was worth about 20 points.  So with all that work black pretty much broke even point-wise however with weaker shape.]
;B[jn];W[jj];B[jh]C[Since you didn't K6 first, you HAVE to get good profit in the center.  If you had led with K6 you would have miai of bottom and center, and not so much pressure on you.]
;W[kh];B[ki];W[ji];B[kg];W[jg];B[lh];W[ih];B[ig];W[jf];B[hg]
LB[hh:a][ii:b]C[Start the ko with 'a'.  If white plays 'b' play this move.  This is a huge ko, but black has a lot of threats against the bottom middle group, could possibly even kill.  The big plus is that black can ignore almost any white ko threat if he wants, because besides the immediate profit, black can then easily draw out his stone on the top.]
;W[hh];B[gg];W[gh];B[fg];W[eg];B[fh];W[eh]C[At this point it seemed that I either save the left side or the white center group will escape by cutting off the black G13 group.
What should I do?]
(;B[fi];W[dk];B[ek];W[ej]C[Heeheheheheheheheee :) Well actually...]

(;B[fj];W[ei]C[I gave the left side.
I did not realize at this time that I lost the game because white ends up with more territory

Yes, side is huge.  Much bigger than middle];B[kh];W[gk];B[gl]

(;B[kk]SQ[kq][kr][jr]C[Once again, this is unnecessary, and cost black sente.  You only need to be one move ahead in a capturing race to win it.  A placement in one of these spots would give black a hope. *]

;B[ns];W[gm];B[hm]C[Well, that's it for now.  The big thing to learn in this game is fortunatly a simple one.  You only need to win a capturing race by one move.  There were two instances in this game you could have captured in sente, and instead did so in gote.  Besides that you did a good job dealing with the right, but you should have tried to move your invasion stones on top.

(;B[dl]LB[ck:a][cm:b]C[Here is a very good way to play.  There is a proverb, a kyu player tries to make territory, a dan player tries to connect stones.  This is the best move to connect.  If white plays at 'a' or 'b', you can just connect to the right of his move, and he will face great difficulties in making these stones live, while black gets very thick.  Because of this, he will most likely try to break through.]
