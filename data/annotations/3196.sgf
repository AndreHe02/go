C[Hello, dear reviewer.



I played this game as white. At the end of this game I did very big mistake which cost me this game. Anyway even if I didn't do it game would be very close. This result surprised me a bit as my impression during the game was that my opponent played many slow moves. But giving close result (in case if wouldn't do that mistake) it means I didn't play and better.



Thanks for review.



P.S. I commented some my bad moves (as I think).



Dear player,

I just finished to see our game, move by move, and I am now ready to comment it. The main message that I want to send to you is to not forget how to win : you just need to have more points than the opponent. Now when you play, it seems that only a few numbers of your moves seems to worry about this. You need to think more about the points in your game. During my review, I will show you where you played badly regarding of the points and I will give you an example of what you should have done. I only can provide you an example of what can be played since I cannot play a move and be absolutly sure that it is the best move to play (I am not a god, I am just a little 3k who didn't play for a while :-) ). Let's start the review.]
;B[qp]TR[qd]SQ[pd]C[Dear players, just for your information :

The usual (polite) place where to play this move when you are black is R16 if the black player is on the line A1~T1 and the white player is on the line A19~T19.

Where ever the players are around the goban, this move in R4 is not polite and could be considered as an offense to the eyes of some players in Asia (and perhaps in a lot of other parts of the world), so it is better to play it in the right place :-)

For a 4-4 stone as the first move and if we suppose that the white player is sit in front of the line A19~T19, the polite move is Q16.]
;W[dp];B[pd];W[op]C[I want to prevent enclosure here.];B[pn]
;W[dd]C[P4 seems to be safe for now so I'm taking the corner.



In fact, P4 is not really safe since it can be surrounded and black can use the chase of the stone/group (if you decide to not sacrifice it) to build influence and convert it in territory easily.]
;B[mp];W[no];B[ko];W[dj]TR[no][op]C[Again it seems I can tenuki and so I take big point.


You two stones are not safe. If you tenuki here, it means that you are ready to sacrifice your 2 stones for a move witch will give you more points that to save the 2 stones. If you want to sacrify P4, then you should not play in O5 since it give to black the opportunity to play L5.

Of course, if you really want to save your 2 stones, you can, but black will make a lot of influence by chasing them and he will make a lot of points.]

(;B[cn]C[I wonder if it is correct direction for black? Is it better to approach from outside?


I don't know which one is better :
- It is true that here, you can give to black a heavy shape, but if black survive, white will not have territory in C6. The zone around G3 will be to claim by both players, so nothing is certain.
- If black approach from F3 or F4, both players can make territory easily.

Please see variations.];W[co]TR[dj]C[Trying to make black heavy as I have marked stone.]
;B[bk]
(;W[cl]C[I'm not sure I handled this invasion well. Black settles easily in several moves. On the other hand he just get second line territory and I get thickness and influence.


You should not see each move close to an opponent stone as an invasion. If you want to progress, you need to learn that nothing is the property of someone after only 14 moves. Here, instead of C8, you could also consider to leave enough space to black to live around C8 and build a wall around B10~D10 that you could change in territory with an extension.

See variation for an example.];B[bl];W[cm];B[bm]
(;W[dn]C[Instead of this move, you could think also to play a move in B11.

See variantions.];B[ci]C[Here, black made the right choice.]
;W[di];B[ch]C[Pushing further and helping black to make territory on third line does no good for white, doesn't it?

D11 doesn't help you to get some points at all. It only help black to get some. You cannot try to make points in the center in this way, since the center is still open to everybody. If black want to destroy your influence in the center, he just ned to play inside and make his stone alive, which is for now really easy and not immediatly necessary.]
;W[nm]C[So I'm trying to take care of my weak group.

Good choice, but should be done before, I think.];B[pl]C[Here, as I said, black use your escape to make points.]
;W[pq];B[gp]C[G4 seems to far from black stones and to close to my area of influence.

My observations :
- Yes, G4 is too far and it threat nothing (pure gote move), so you are free to play where you want on the goban, not only where your opponent play. K16 for example is also a big move, and there is also a lot of big move.
- No, the stone in G4 is not "a lot" more close of your influence that it is from the black stones. Don't see every of the lonely stones of your opponent as a target for your next move, or you will miss a lot of good moves.]
;W[ip]C[I'm trying to punish G4.

Don't you feel that your stone in J4 is more surronded than G4 is ? :-)

Whose turn is it to play now ? :-)

Those 2 questions are just to make you realize that you don't judge the state of the goban from a impartial point of view. Your agressivity can be a problem for you to progress later. Here, if I was white, I would think "ho ho, cool, an easy target, that exactly what I wanted in order to totally cancel the influence of white around the left side."

Trying to destroy the territory of the opponent is not a bad thing, but you should also consider the other one : make peacefully some territory. Here, G4 was not really peaceful, the player wanted too much territory.

Anyway, sometime we need to be agressive. If I were you, I would also play J4, but not now, that's too early in the game. Don't you feel that it is better to stop the expansion of the Q8 group ?]
;B[io];W[ho]
(;B[jp];W[hp]C[Here white was lucky that black didn't play the variante that I propose, see variation.]
;B[nq];W[qq]C[Here, if I am black, I play elsewhere. Of course, white need to have a basis, but he will have it in gote. Such a move like O7 was also gote. If I where you I probably first try to be sure to live by making a basis first, and then expend to the center IF NEEDED and if there is nowhere else to have a better move which give points.]
;B[rp];W[rq]TR[fc][nc][jd][ce][qf][qi]C[This move is probably too slow. Tenuki?

This move is slow, yes. You should play a big points move instead. For example, one of the ones I show to you.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[bc]C[This move is a mistake for black.];W[dc]
C[Good answer.];B[bd]
(;W[in]TR[db][gd][be]C[This move doesn't help that much for the points.

You should play G16 is you want some points.
Another better move B15 or D18 which seems sente for the life of the corner.

See variations.];B[be];W[jo]C[This move is only 2 points. The whole goban is still empty on the upper side and on the right. The game is still partially in the openning phase.]
;B[jq];W[jd]TR[dc][cd][dd]C[Too far?

It depends .. in the beginning of the game, it is not too far since you can considere the option of having your stones splitted in many groups. but now is not the beginning of the game, and after a split, your stones in D16 would feel quickly lonely and without eyes. so if the opponent split by playing G17 for example, you will have to protect the 3 stones and G17 will grow at the same time, and K16 will stay a single stone and be useless faces to a big black group around G17.

If you want to make points, don't play like that.
White in G16 was better.];B[gr];W[hq];B[hr];W[gq];B[fr];W[fq]
;B[er];W[pf];B[mc]
(;W[ne]TR[gd][qd][qi]C[Now it seems like very bad move to me. Keima is for attack but there is no attack here. I guess it is better just make base

This move have none purpose if you don't have an idea about how to use it. If you want to progress, try to play only usefull moves.

Here I show some examples of usefull moves. Both of them are helping in making points and are making solid groups by helping a lonely stone.

The only use of O15 that I can see is to support another white stone in O17.]
;B[hc]TR[jd]C[I didn't handle this invasion well. Guess I'd have much easier game if marked stone was played on place of black earlier.

;W[pp];B[nj];W[oi]TR[qp][rp]C[Mistake? It seems it was better to trade P10 for marked stones.

it depends if you want to keep the sente or not. If you let black eat P10, you will have to protect in the move after if you want to have some territory points.

Since you choosed to save P10, your opponent have also to play to save the 2 stones.

The difference between the 2 options is that after you eat the 2 stones, black have not soo many points to protect, he may choose to not play to protect it, making your capture of the 2 stones gote. The territory of white after P10 seems to have more points to protect.

I guess you made the right choice.];B[ro]
