C[Hi my name is Terence and I played Black. All your comments are greatly appreciated (particularly for the opening), thanks in advance, Terence.

cg -- Hi.  I've marked my comments with "cg".  I think there were a couple of mistakes that cost you the game...  trying to save your stones in the center rather than connecting your two top groups with N17 ... giving up too much territory in the top left...]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dq];B[cj]TR[jd][jp]C[cg -- This is clearly big, but I think it's not a good move.  Both of the white corners are set up to create an enclosure facing the marked positions so I wouldn't expect white to develop the left side much anyway.  I would suggest P3 or O3 instead, then probably white Q10, and then black can approach a white corner.]

(;B[mq];W[pq];B[nr];W[qq];B[co];W[fp];B[hq]C[cg -- It's probably better to make the left side solid by playing E6.  Black seems a little overconcentrated on the bottom.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[ch];B[ej];W[eh]LB[ho:A][eq:B]C[cg -- See variation B.  White can be severely punished for leaving the weakness at E3.  (Although it might be better to wait a bit...)

cg -- Also, H5 seems slow to me and drives white toward black's weak left side.  Black doesn't need to protect the bottom.  K16 looks huge.]

C[cg -- Black paying for the too-wide extension on the left side.]
;B[en];W[em]LB[fm:A][fo:B]C[cg -- Variation B works out better for black, I think.]

[mc:B][hm:A]C[cg -- N17 is huge.  Given that B2 kills, black can probably win easily with N17.  D18 also big, but N17 first to make two groups fully secure.  Trying to save F7 is a mistake.]
