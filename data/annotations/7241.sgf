C[burrito reviews debo-kuggle,


You asked: "White was leading throughout the game. how could I play to get sente / bigger moves?"

My response is that black was leading through most of the game.  Black made a big mistake in the lower left at which point the game was over and no amount of of sente moves would have solved the problem.  

I've commented the game up to that point.  I hope that helps.  And remember to try and read out the positions as thoroughly as possible before playing them.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[ic];W[pf];B[nd]LB[nd:B][qf:A]C[kuggel [9k\]: was it correch?

Yes.  Normally white approaches the chinese openning at A, and black responds with B.   The high response at B is normal against the high approach of B, so I feel it's right here.]

;W[mr];B[jr];W[ls];B[op]C[at this point, you have to ask what you are trying to accomplish.  saving the O2 stone is just not interesting.  Your idea should be to use the aji of that stone to attack the corner/side in a co-ordinated way.  Although O2 did factor in to the attack, my feeling from watching it is that you didn't have a clear plan and were just hoping that your fighting skills were enough.  That is the wrong strategy at this point, because if you make a mistake you turn a winnable game into a likely loss.  

I would recommend either approaching the corner with a more cohesive attack plan or playing elsewhere to get some immediate profit.

However, since your attack to did succeed you were in good shape]

C[kuggel [9k\]: what is a correct reactionon this invasion?

First, notice the effect on your corner from not playing out the joseki.  Your corner is weak and now white's move is hard to deal with]

(;B[lc]C[there is a proverb which is "don't touch weak stones".  This one white stone is weak, and your stones are strong.  Touching the white stones will make them stronger, which is not what you want]
;W[kd];B[ie]C[now, when you build your moyo ...];W[mc]C[white is strong enough to even try and attack you.  though if I were white, I would first jump out to the middle.]
;B[nc]C[your corner is weak, so it's hard not to be submissive here.]
