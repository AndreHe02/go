AB[pd][dp]C[Reviewed by Joe Carl (2k) for black
sarmad [9k\]: hi];W[pp];B[dc];W[cn]C[Is C15 bigger than C6?

Joe: Yes, Shimari's and approaches to an unfinished corner is bigger than approaching a 4-4 stone or a 3-3 stone.]
;B[fq];W[bp]C[Here I considered playing C8 but since this is a handicap game I decided to go with the peaceful move. What is your opinion?

Joe: Closeing the top left corner is still biggest.  But what you played is fine, as well as what you suggest.]
;B[cq];W[ck];B[ce];W[fc]C[This looks way too close to my shimari, what is the correct way to take advantage of this move?

Joe: J17 looks best to me.  It constricts white tightly, white might counter pincer but then you squeeze yet again and white has two weak groups to your one.  White will be in trouble.  See variation.]

(;B[hc]C[Joe This is a tad too close.  See variation.]
(;W[fe]C[Joe: When white jumps, Black should just settle his group.  There is no point in chasing White.  You can't kill it, just leave it weak.  See variation.]

(;B[he];W[nc];B[lc];W[pb]C[This move confused me...
Joe: White is trying to settle his group, but not doing it properly.  Just play R17 and make him live in a small place.]

;W[od];B[pc];W[qe];B[qf];W[pf];B[pg];W[pe]C[Joe: the game just got easy for white.]
;B[rg]C[Joe Is S15 and R14 all that important?  They take no territory, they don't seperate white, they are not important at all.  Move on and play a big move.]
;W[og]
(;B[ef]C[I wanted to attack the white group but is this attachment move correct?
Joe: No, attack from a distance, and give it a dual purpose.  See variation.]

;W[ec];B[dd];W[ea];B[nq];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq];B[kq];W[iq]C[again i thought this move was too much
Joe: It is, but you ignored it.  See variation]
(;B[ih];W[gi];B[dj];W[bq]C[Joe:  You shouldn't ignore this move.  It makes J3 a good move now.]
;B[fh]C[Joe: You are too intent on killing stones, rather then making territory.]
;W[gh];B[dk];W[dl];B[cl];W[bl];B[el];W[dm];B[jp]C[I decided to attack the srtone from this side so i can build thickness that will help me reduce the right side (variation). Is my thinking correct?

Joe: No, you are runnig white right across your weak group on the bottom.  This is going to hurt.  White had 3 weak groups now he will only have 1 and black will have 2 weak groups.  This is where the game turns around]

(;W[gq];B[fo];W[fm];B[gp];W[ho];B[hp];W[ip];B[io]C[here i couldn't think of anything else but to try to kill the bottom...

Joe: Seems reasonable to me, white should die here];W[kr];B[lr]
;W[jq];B[kp];W[jo];B[in];W[js]C[Joe: It takes 8 stones at a minimum to live on the side, White still owes you 2 more stones.  All you have to do is make the room too small to get two eyes.  Don't work so hard.]
;B[gr];W[lq]C[with this I almost died, how should this cut be handled?]

;B[no];W[mo];B[lo]C[Here was the mistake.]
(;W[ln];B[mn];W[se]C[Joe: S15 is not doing anything.  Just let it go, it's only 2 points.  This is a pass for white.]
;B[rf];W[nh]
(;B[gk]C[Joe: Here black ignores his own group to try and kill white.  Black is winning by a large margin, and decides he wants more.]
;W[ii];B[ji];W[ij];B[kh];W[oj]C[On the right side is it still possible to live for black? (variation)]

;B[pi]C[looks alive here...

Not the best wayt to try and kill black, nor the best way to live, but yes Black can live, he can even give up a little bit and survive with a portion of it.  A really good player would probably attack the bottom right corner first and steal that as well as living.]
