Hello Reviewer,

Thanks for reviewing my game. I am black in this game.

dv: Hi. I think that the main cause of your defeat is that you thought of your central stones as controling territory while they were a constant source of worry because they were short of eyespace in the vicinity of strong white groups. I didn't expect white to win after you having taken all the corners, but the corners were too small and you had to play too many defensive moves so that his sides and centre turned out to be bigger. 

It is a nice lesson about thickness, also for me, though I can see several spots where you had your chances against his sometimes too gluttonous play.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk]C[I was experimenting with the High Chinese opening. I am not really familliar with it, so I was expermenting.

dv: The Chinese opening and in particular the high Chinese, focuses on the centre. While building a moyo at the right side, Black hopes for White to invade, so as to make him heavy and attack his invasion stones. This will yield either natural territory at the right or influence in the centre.

This is easily misunderstood as actively making territory on the right with the three stones, which is usually a mistake. It is not this kind of mistake though that makes us lose games. In spite of this rant, in my opinion fuseki is not so important at our level.]
;W[qf];B[qh]C[Should I have played O16 instead?

dv: Look at the variation for W8]
(;W[of]C[dv: However, this is not so good for White. See var.]

(;B[qe]C[dv: Strengthening White is not necessary.];W[re];B[rd]
;W[pe];B[qd];W[od];B[oc];W[nd]C[Not exactly great for black here. White is out and the corner is under some duress.

dv: Yes. This is due to B9. I'd say the mistakes at 8 and 9 cancel out each other.]
;B[pg];W[pf];B[nc];W[mc]
(;B[jp]LB[md:a]C[Probably continuing @ N18 would have been better.

dv: The first thing to think of here is the cut at 'a'. See var.

The bottom line of the calculations is that it will lead to a tough fight, which looks harder for White.

In a fast game like this one, you have to rely on feeling and preference. Your move at 21 invites White to make a strong shape at 'a', and stake the game on a moyo contest. See next var.]

(;W[po];B[np]
(;W[pm]LB[qq:a]C[dv: settling at 'a' would be usual.];B[nk]
LB[md:b][qp:a]C[dv: so preventing settlement would be natural too. However, if you are still looking to cut at 'b', this move may be very helpful in launching a double attack.]
;W[nn];B[ll]LB[md:b][qp:a]C[dv: This is not a severe attack on White, because the corner is still available for settling his stones. I would either play 'a' or cut at 'b'.]
;W[ln]C[dv: but White keeps on marching on neutral ground.]
;B[lp]C[dv: and lets you take territory while attacking. Good.]
;W[jn]C[I felt this attack was profitable.];B[dj]LB[md:a]C[This is too far too fast...perhaps.

dv: I don't think so. Looks like a fine point. Now that White is out, the cut at 'a' may be too agressive and bring danger to your own group at the right side. So staying away far from White's strength and your relative weakness is OK.]
;W[dl];B[dg];W[fc];B[jl];W[rg]LB[mb:d][md:c][in:b][qp:a]C[This move by White turned out to be more powerful than I expected.

dv: This is a small territorial point, although it gives additional strength to the White group. 

You can now take territory at 'a', threatening to enclose White's group at 'b'. After 34 and 36, the cut at "a' has become less interesting. Locally, 'd' may now take preference but I'm not sure one should play it anyhow. See var.]

(;B[mb];W[lc];B[le];W[me];B[ld];W[md]C[dv: Both 39 and 41 are way too close to White's thickness. In particular 41 takes away your own liberties. The stones are almost useless.]
;B[id]C[My goal was to control the center. But the groups are too loosely knit together, and I got practically nothing.

dv: Controlling the centre with the 5-35 stones is a mistake in thinking.The focus should be on the lower right, as shown in a previous variation.]
;W[lb]
(;B[qb]C[dv: Two questions:

1. Is it really necessary to defend here ?
2. If so, is this the best point ?

See vars.];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[rb];W[mg]C[White plays close to strength. This is a mistake.]
;B[jg]C[dv: This light move, making a global connection between 33-31-35-51 is good. several points:

- It would be a mistake to think that with three relatively weak groups it is possible to make territory in the centre. They are not weak enough to be attacked succesfully, but they are too weak to hope for territory in the centre. The focus remains at the lower right.]
;W[qj]C[This caused me major problems.

dv: I don't see why. White is attacking two weak stones close to her strength.  you should sacrifice them and strengthen your group.]
;B[qk];W[rj];B[fq];W[rk]LB[qp:a]C[I think White S9 was bigger than F3. Is this true?

dv: difficult question. It is true S9 makes territory and connects the white stones. 55 is more a 'big' move than it is 'urgent'.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cp];W[co];B[fr];W[fs]
;B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[bk]LB[qp:a]C[dv: This is too low. 'a' would have been far bigger.]
;W[gr];B[ir];W[hq]C[I got the corner, but white takes center - an even trade. Yet S9 created bottom territory later for white and solidified his groups.

dv: White captures 55 and 65 on a very small scale. You have three corners but with all that strength, White will now  have effective attacks on your groups in the upper half and centre.]
;B[iq];W[hp]C[dv: both 75 and 76 are very small];B[hl]C[dv: That's a very good move, strengthening your 31-33-35-51 quadrant connection. Still it would be a mistake to think of central territory.]
;W[ql]C[dv: Also slow. The lower right corner is far bigger.]
;B[qp]C[dv: very good. You have more points now that White and few weaknesses.]
;W[qo];B[rp];W[ro]
(;B[rq]C[I made this move fearing a push at Q4. It seems premature looking at it now. If the push was made at Q4, I could have done it then.

dv: see var.];W[cf]
(;B[cc]C[I make small life here, but as a result compromise my center.

dv: It is known that this invasion can be killed or end up in ko, given enough strength for Black at the outside. I think strengthening the outside takes preference. See var.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[bd];W[be];B[eb];W[fb];B[bb]
(;W[db];B[cb];W[ea];B[ac];W[ee];B[fg]C[very good. You keep managing to live in all corners and receive sente to patch up your weakness in the center.]
;W[bm];B[ar]C[dv: If this is not necessary for life in the corner, this is just small endgame.]
;W[gj]C[This was a perfect invasion by white.

dv:  There is no territory here, just connection and eyespace.]
;B[ii];W[gh];B[gg];W[hh];B[fk]C[Good.];W[hg];B[hf]C[He looks in trouble but manages to escape.]
;W[if];B[ie];W[ig]
(;B[he]C[This probably should have been K14 instead.

dv: Absolutely.];W[jf];B[gk]C[I made this move fearing the large central group could be cut off and killed. White had escaped at this point. for all intents.]
;W[kg];B[ei]C[Now my group is solid (though not really as will be seen), but I have lost any center territory of significance.

dv: There was no territory, so there is no loss. The real thing here is that your group, though connected, is still withouth clear cut eyeshape.]
;W[ef];B[fe];W[eg];B[fh];W[jh]C[This seems like a wasted move to me by White.]
;B[oi]LB[bh:a][hj:b][kj:c]C[While this was a big save for me.

dv: What's important here is your large group, not the two stones. Several moves come to mind to improve your eyeshape: a, b or c. 'b' may be the best.]
;W[ci];B[cj];W[ch];B[lh]C[A blatant mistake. The peep does not work.]
;W[fj];B[fi];W[hj]C[dv: This move really hurts.];B[dk];W[ek]
