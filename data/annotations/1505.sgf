C[elc: Hello,

elc: This is a game I (elconde) played against fraub on IGS.  I am Black,
Fraub is White.  I have a 28 kyu, and my friend Fraub has a 26 kyu.

elc: I was hoping for any sort of general comments about how I can improve
my game play.  I also have a few specific questions that I will bring up
during the game. My comments are marked with elc:.

elc: Thank you very much for looking at my game.
elc: -elconde];B[dp]C[Hi Elconde,

I have looked your game over and have some comments for you.  Rather than make lots of move suggestions, I would like to make a couple of major points, with some examples along the way.

There is a go proverb:  stay away from thickness.  Thickness is a position that is strong, ie. unattackable.

The second point is that you create groups with many many weaknesses.  I will explain this further during the game.  But it is a fatal flaw you must overcome.

I will try to answer your questions.  You may ask me for clarifications or additional data on anything you like after looking the review over.]

[pk:e][qj:f][pj:g][pn:h][on:i][qo:j]C[elc: That is the proper response, no?

This is a fine response and is quite normal. 

There are many "correct" responses.  Any of these shown are good.

Some would disagree with "j".  "i" is kind of position dependent, and is a bit uncommon.]
;W[pk];B[cf];W[qh];B[fc]C[elc: Now that I have made this move, I don't know how to proceed.

With this move, you have picked a fight.  You are attacking the corner.  There isn't really a set pattern of play from here, but your objective is *not* to kill the corner stone.  That would be an unreasonable expectation.  You want to get some profit while attacking. 

Attacking and hoping for profit along the way is normal, good play.]

;W[ee];B[fe];W[df];B[cd]LB[cg:a]C[elc: I try pushing in from the left...

Ok, two things:

1.  First priority is to keep your groups safe.  Do not let them become surrounded.

2.  To attack something  (to kill  or threaten to kill something), you must first *surround* it.  Taking away eyes is totally meaningless if the group just runs away into the middle.  

Therefore, a move at 'a' would be much healthier for point 1.  You have no possibility of attacking the white group at the moment because there is no immediate possibility of surrounding it.]
;W[cc];B[bd];W[bc]LB[cg:a][bg:b]C[You must now run away or white will surround you.]
;B[ad];W[cg];B[bg];W[bf];B[af];W[ce]TR[cd][bd][ad]C[elc: ... but I soon find my stones in danger.]
;B[be];W[cf];B[ed];W[bh]C[Yes, your stones on the left are dead.]
;B[ef];W[fd]CR[gc][ge][ff]C[Here is a perfect example of what I told you about at the beginning.  The white group is totally strong.  There is no possibility of successfully attacking it.  Therefore, it is "thick."  You don't want to play near it, much less up against it.  Furthermore, your stones are not linked.  You have cutting points at all of the marked locations.  White will cut you to pieces, and then attack the small, defenseless pieces.]
;B[bb]TR[ec][db][da][dd][dc][cc][bc]C[elc: I make these moves in hope that my opponent will ignore them and I
can grab his d17 group.  It's a lost cause, no?

Yes.  White could ignore *several* moves and still live.  Go is a game where you have to figure out what is possible, and pursue that.  Wishful thinking is a sure way to lose.]
;W[ed];B[ac];W[ag];B[cb];W[ae];B[ab];W[af]C[White was very kind to answer your last three moves.  Plays almost anywhere else on the board would have been much better.]

;B[jc];W[ke];B[kd];W[je]LB[le:a]C[White should just play out at 'a' rather than connect.  It would leave your stones in the center weak and floating in space.]

C[This wall with the extension in the corner are quite valuable.  Well done.  You have still left cutting points though.  Your last move would be better if you just played stronger at D9.  One less cutting point.  It makes a big difference.]

;W[me];B[ng]C[elc: I've noticed that when my opponent always wants to get out.]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[lg];B[lh];W[kg];B[kh];W[fq]C[elc: White starts to invade.  What should I have done to defend better?]
;B[hr]LB[eq:a]TR[jq]C[kicking at "a" would be better.  It keeps him out of the corner and you already have a stone on the right (marked) that will limit his ability to extend in that direction.]

;W[hp];B[io]TR[fo][go][ep][fq][hp][dq][dr]CR[cp]C[elc: It seems as if I could have taken these stones.  Could I have?

Not at this point.  White is alive.  You have too many weakness of your own to kill his.  Most notably, the one marked in red.]
;W[hq];B[gr];W[gq];B[do]LB[cp:a][bp:b]C[good move.  You fix your weakness.  Now if white cuts at "a", you capture his stone in a ladder starting with "b".]
;W[fr];B[ds];W[es];B[cs];W[gs];B[hs];W[fs]C[elc: It's now clear that I can't prevent two eyes.]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[jr];W[is]C[elc: That was just carelessness.]

[pl:d][nk:e]C[elc: I want to invade on the right, but I do a terrible job.  How should I
have proceeded?

Tough call.  You have two choices.  One is to invade and attack.  The other is to "reduce".  Reduce means to try to make his territory smaller without attacking.  To decide which, you must get some idea of the score.

By my quick count, white has about 70 points if you reduce.  Black has about 80, maybe more.  So don't take the risk of an all out attack.

If you *did* have to attack, I would probably start with "a" and see what happened.  

But since you don't need to do that, I would play at "b", forcing white to defend, and then take the corner with "c."  White still has a hard time ignoring "c", so you might get to play some additional forcing moves around "d" or just take a bit of profit starting with a move like "e."]
;W[pi];B[pj]LB[ok:a][oj:b]C[play simple.  "a" or "b".];W[oj]
;B[ph]C[Much like in the top left and center, you are playing weak stones right up against a very strong group, and leaving many many cutting points.  That is why the bad result.]
;W[qj];B[nl];W[oh];B[nh];W[ni];B[og];W[pg];B[pl];W[ql];B[qm]
C[exact same mistake.];W[pm];B[om];W[ol]TR[ni][oh][pg][qf][qh]
[pi][oj][pk][qj][ol][ql][pm][qn]C[elc: White's formation appears very weak to me.  Could I have broken it up
somehow?

White's formation is totally strong.  There is no possibility whatsoever of hurting it.]

;B[ro];W[rn];B[so]C[elc: The capture of those stones was completely serendipitous.]
;W[sn];B[op];W[im];B[jm];W[ip];B[jp]C[elc: I think I'm lucky he doesn't play h6.

You are right.  Well done on the analysis and on seeing the snapback.]

(;W[in];B[jo];W[hn];B[hl];W[pe];B[ck]C[elc: I'm on endgame mode now.]
;W[pf];B[np];W[od];B[nb];C[Well, it came out quite close.  If you take my two main points to heart, you will improve a lot right away.

A final word:  First priority is keeping your groups safe.  Then attack.  Take profit while threatening to kill rather than becoming committed to actually killing.

Hope this helps.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Darrell.]
;C[elc: So I lose.  I seem to have had good center territory until I began
invading on the right.  Then I lost most of it.  What should I have done
better to keep it?

elc: Any comments will be greatly appreciated.

elc: Thank You])
