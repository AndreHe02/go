C[Thank you for reviewing my game!

I felt content with the way I played. I was pretty confident in the beginning up until the death of one of my groups. It appears I may to do alot more life and death problems ^_^().

Your comments no matter how harsh, are greatly appreciated!


Hi there!

My name is Rainer (Beholder).

Generally speaking, the loss of a group that big is most of the time enough to lose a game. Here it made the difference between losing and winning.

Please see the comments I made for a better understanding how important it is not to make too many weak groups as they can and will be used against you every time.

Best regards

(;B[fq]SQ[pc]C[B: This attack would be better on the upper side, because the marked stone is on the third line and backs up this kind of move much better.]
;W[dn]
(;B[fo]LB[jp:B][dr:A]TR[fq]C[B: This move is a bit unusual. You normally should try to get a base for the stone on the third line with A or B for example.]
;W[lq]C[B: White has more than enough room for an invasion.]

(;B[nq]LB[jq:A]C[B: Wrong side. If you play at A you get a much better result.]
;W[iq]LB[pj:B][dr:A]TR[lq]SQ[fo][fq]C[I was a little clueless at this point, so I dedcided to do an enclosure @ R15. Was that a good decision, or are there better?

B: Let's have a look at the board. The lower right corner is more or less covered and an extension up the right side would be nice.
An attack upon the upper left corner at A would be another possibility and would be more profitable than the attack on the lower left. The marked white stones are practically alive. The marked black stones are not in danger at the moment, but they are weak and offer a target for white.
I would probably play A first, which is sente, and continue with an extension at B.]
;B[qe];W[jc]C[B: This is where black would have liked to play after the enclosure of the upper right corner.]
;B[mc]LB[pj:A][cl:B]C[B: This is not big enough. The extension is too narrow. Better play at A or B for example.]
;W[qj]C[B: White takes the big point first...];B[gc]SQ[mc]C[B: For a pincer this is too wide. What is your follow up move? White could just jump into the middle and live easily. Black creates his second weak group here.]
;W[hd]LB[ge:A]C[B: Just jumping to A is not possible any more...]

(;B[fe]C[Was this the best move to respond to the shoulder hit @ H16 , or are there better ones?

B: Not easy to say. Have a look at the variations. The problem is not this move but the one before at G17.]

(;B[dj]LB[hf:A][dr:B]C[B: This move is a bit dubious. You have two weak groups on the board and this move is not necessarily sente. Perhaps a move at A or B would be better, because they are probably sente...]
;W[dh];B[cm];W[cn];B[dm];W[em];B[el];W[fm];B[en]TR[em][fm]C[I wanted to see if a cut here @ E6 was useful, was it?

B: It would have been useful if you had constantly attacked the marked stones after the cut.]

;W[dc];B[ib];W[gf];B[ff];W[hg];B[gh];W[jh];B[ci];W[ch];B[nm]
C[B: This enlarges your moyo, but gives white the big chance to attack your weak stones.]
;W[eo];B[ho];W[jo]LB[dr:A]C[My lower left group is being closed in at this point. I figured I could make it live. Would it have been better if i tried to escape to the center, and if so, what was a good move to do it?

B: Your best chances are already wasted. But the most important move would be A, because it is easier to build eyespace at the sides.]
