(;W[pr]TR[lq]C[I dislike this move for two reasons. One, it settles the corner, splitting it. Second, it gives black the chance to pincer at M3 and reduce the area that white is more interested in.]
;B[qq];W[kq]TR[lp]C[After L3, your position in your wall is low, meaning black can easily reduce it at K4. White would feel a bit more active if this movei s played at M4, but still, white ends up feeling over concentrated on the bottom.]
;B[fc];W[id];B[he]TR[gd]C[This is a move I'm not familiar with. Right of the bat, my instinct says trick move. I would recommend pulling it up on a joseki site like dailyjoseki.com or something for a much more detailed answer, however, I will attempt to give you some feed back off my reading. First off, this move has an obvious weakness, at G16. So blatant this weakness is, that this would seem to be the trick. Black is hoping you will play at G16. Check the first variations to see what I believe the trick play is trying to achieve. So now that we see the trick.. we know what to avoid. Sometimes, the best way to punish.. is simply to threaten to punish. Since the G16 isn't playable yet.. we do something that will make it become more attractive (which I think you attempted). I myself, prefer to strengthen the corner, since territory is more valuable there]
