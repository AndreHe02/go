C[This is a game where I really felt like I was winning for a while, but ended up losing by a very wide margin.
I was black, regular komi.

G: Hi! I will preceede my comments with G: when there are other comments. Enjoy the review!]
;B[pq]C[Still learning opening sequences. I try something different every now and then.

G: Good! Although this is perhaps the most common opening move though - so not exactly new :)]
;W[qd];B[ep];W[cc];B[pj];W[cp];B[ip]C[Wasn't really sure, but extending to the right from E4 seemed like the biggest move.]
;W[oc];B[dm]TR[cn][co][cq]C[G: Nice plan to attack this stone since W left out the reply, but I think you can go in harder here. One of the marked points for example.]
;W[cq];B[df]C[I feel this is too high here... go 3rd row instead.]
;W[ec]C[if you had both D14 and E7 at 3rd line now, D10 would have been nice]
;B[jd]C[again too high - the corners and edges give points - the center not. Now white has 3 corners and you none.]
;W[bn]C[again - if D7 at 3rd line you could take sente now and play q5]
;B[bl];W[po];B[np];W[ql]
(;B[qg]C[Should I have played S10 here?

G: Hmm - you could have attacked more - the center is yours you do not have to worry if you have to run in there... so see variation]
;W[rj];B[ri];W[qj];B[qi];W[hc]TR[jc][mc]C[again problems  because K16 is not K17 - otherwise would now be a nice extension]
;B[he]C[This is pointless - you cannot protect the center, you cannot pressure W's C17 group.]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[kq];B[kp]C[I regretted that move after making it, but it didn't work out as badly as I feared...

G: No no - this is fine - you are very strong in the area.]
;W[ko];B[jp];W[pk]C[I thought he was going to play N3, but he plaed on the middle right instead.

G: Where would you have played if he played N3? Why didn't you play there anyway if you thought that more urgent... this black group could still run, even if he cut at q11...]

(;B[oj];W[ok];B[mp]TR[mq]C[N3 is better - leaves less trouble for later]
;W[lo];B[di]C[nice - but now you have the trouble again the your "skirt is open" ... i think the saying goes :)]
;W[jn]C[Bad move by white - just ignore :)];B[im]TR[hn][dr]
C[If you want to protect your territory H6 or D2 is better - more interesting would be splitting W at O7 - thus setting up S6 or something...]
;W[in];B[hn];W[kl];B[mk]TR[nm];W[jk]
(;B[ik];W[ki]C[This is just forcing white into your own weak group]
;B[mh];W[nn]C[In retrospect, this might be the point where things started to go poorly for me - white was building a large territory there.

G: The score guesstimator still puts you ahead by 40 points - it goes badly because W now has no weak groups, so nothing you can attack to make profit. Weak groups are the engine of the game!]

(;B[ih]C[Hmm... not very big - see alternatives.];W[lc]
(;B[le]C[This achieves very little - it goes a bit towards connecting the R13 group - but your moves should always have more than one purpose - also, this is GOTE, W can now do whatever he wants again.]

G: It happens :) Your main mistake was not cutting the two white groups around O8 much earlier - then you could have harassed white for the rest of the game. W also got lots of large sente end-game moves, many of these I am sure you saw as well - and he just got the first. Get there first next time :)]
