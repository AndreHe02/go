AB[pd][dp][dd]C[Hello Rex,

I received this game from the GTL to review.

This is my first review at GTL and I hope you will profit from
my comments.

I commented both sides, Black and White until it was clear (from
my point of view), that Black will loose.

If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me via
email.

For your Info: I am a German 1 Kyu and my rank on IGS is 6k*.



Best Regards

P.S.: Please excuse my poor English.];W[pq];B[po]TR[pd]C[Very good. This move makes full use of the power of the marked
star point stone.];W[np]C[A bit too submissive for my taste.

Since this is a 3-stone-handicap-game, White should pincer somehow.]

(;B[qm]C[This move is really submissive.
As long as the white stones are weak, Black shouldn't play submissively.

See variation.];W[qp]C[You see, how White punished your mistake.

White has a nice corner and your stones become heavy.];B[qo]

(;W[ro]TR[qm][po][qo]C[This is not the right way to  attack the marked black stones.

White should have play as in the variation.];B[rn]C[Good move.]
;W[rq]TR[qm][rn][qo][po]C[This move is not necessary.

Black is now in a very good position. The four marked stones
are no longer heavy - no, they are thick instead, with excellent
shape!!!
I think this was a great deal for Black.

Black should now try to find a way, to use his thickness in conjunction
with his upper right star point stone in the most effective way.]
;B[pj]LB[pf:A]C[This move is too far from the star point and too close too the
four thick stones -> overconcentration!!!

If Black wants to play at the right side, he should play around
A. Black then  shouldn't be afraid of a white invasion on the
right side.];W[cn]C[Good point.];B[fp];W[jp]
(;B[hq]TR[cn]C[Black shouldn't passively defend his corner. This is exactly,
what White wants.

Don't make the moves, White wants you making.

Black should instead attack the marked stone.

Black should play as in the variation.];W[ir];B[hr];W[iq]
(;B[dn]C[This move only strengthens White.

See variation.];W[cq];B[cp]C[Good! Sacrify the corner territory, in order to get center influence
and territory on the left side.];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[er]
;B[cm]LB[ck:A]C[Too close. Black should play around A.];W[cf]
LB[ch:B][ck:A]TR[cm]C[Now imagine, the marked stone were at A. Be would become an ideal
pincer.];B[fc]LB[ch:A]C[Black should pincer around A instead.]
;W[bd];B[cj]LB[cc:B][ch:A]C[Too close. Should be played at A.+

A and B are miai, this is too easy for White.];W[di]C[Now Black (probably) lost the upper left corner territory and
White is strong.

Very bad for Black :( .];B[dj];W[ci];B[ei];W[bi];B[bj]LB[eg:A]
TR[fp][dn][dj][ei][dd][fc][pd][pj][qm][po]C[This is an endgame move, since both the White and the Black group
are strong!

You should better have played A.

Do you see that great center moyo?];W[eh];B[fi]LB[fh:A]C[I would play double hane at A here.]
;W[cc];B[lp]C[I think it is too early for an invasion here. There are still
very big points on the upper side and on the right side!];W[lr]
LB[mq:B][kq:A]C[Hmmm ... Very strange! I have never seen such a move, which doesn't
mean, that it is a bad move.

May be, it is a very good move, I don't know.

It seems, this move was played, to make miai between A and B.]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[mp];W[mq];B[no]C[Very good.];W[op];B[oo]C[I think this was very good for Black.]
;W[nc]LB[pf:A]TR[pj]C[Now you see, White couln't/wouldn't play here, if the marked
stone were at A.];B[mn]TR[fi]C[A very big mistake. This move is absolutely not necessary. The
cut doesn't work. Your marked stone is looking forward to the
ladder, which is created after a white cut.

It's really a pity, that you didn't see this, because you were
far ahead.

This is a loosing move :( .];W[qf]C[Very painful for Black.]
;B[oe]C[Good.];W[qc]
(;B[pc]LB[qd:A]C[Wrong direction. Should be at A instead.

Now the game is lost :( !!!

See variation.];W[qd];B[lc];W[jc];B[le];W[gd];B[gc];W[hc];B[hb]
LB[hd:A]C[Black should cut at A instead.];W[ic];B[ib];W[jb]

;B[fd];W[ge];B[ee]LB[ie:A]C[The black group is alive.

You should first hit at the vital point (A) of Whites formation.]

;W[kp];B[ko];W[hp];B[gq];W[ml]C[This is definitely an overplay!!!]
;B[nl]LB[lk:A]C[This move only strengthens White.
Shoulder hit at A!];W[kl];B[lm]LB[lk:A]C[Wrong direction. Should be at A.]
;W[ll]
(;B[km]LB[ki:A]C[White cannot connect to his friend at the bottom. You should
fence White in at A.

See variation.];W[jm];B[fl]LB[jl:B][jn:A]TR[ml][ll][kl][jm]
C[Why? Don't you want to punish White's overplay and kill his four
stones?

You should have played A or B.];W[ej];B[ek];W[gj]C[A trick!]
;B[fj];W[ik]TR[ml][ll][kl][jm][ik][gj]C[Very tricky.

The situation now:

The marked White group has excellent shape now and is no longer
in danger!!!

White is already leading about 15 points.


Since this was a 3-stone-handicap game, and White is already
leading in territory, the rest of the game is less interesting.


I hope, I was able to show you, where and why you lost this game.]
