C[Hi, I played this game against Suzuki 6K*.

EO: Hi, I'm a Swedish 3 dan. Hope you will find my comments useful.



I was getting trounced, I think, until I killed a group at the end to win.  I'd particularly like to know how to make better use of my stones when b gets corner territory.  He erased my thickness in areas pretty easily -- I especially think my joseki choices hurt on the left side.

EO: I think you underestimate you own skills and overestimate your opponents. In my opinion you are a much better player than your opponent and the victory was well deserved.

In this game there was two very important points on the board which were missed by both of you:

(1) M9. This move is huge, but still it was unplayed for over 60 moves! If you don't agree with me that it is important, put the position on a real goban and look at the difference if there is a black or white stone there. You should fall in love with this point!

(2) S7. Once you played M9, you can easily kill the black group with S7. There is no reason to delay it and give black the chance to live.

At the end you got them both which is why you won.];B[dp];W[pd]

(;W[qo];B[qp];W[po];B[ql]C[Here b is trying to get away with corner territory and erasing my left moyo.  He succeeds -- so how should I have stopped him?

If you could show me an alternative sequence or two for this part of the game I'd appreciate it.  Thank you!



(First, though, I should probably p3 and seal black in first before attacking r8.  Ah, hindsight.)

EO: Black is greedy. You have no reason to be scared by this move, rather you should feel happy to get a chance to attack this stone.

Yes, a leaning attack is good in this case (see var.)]
(;W[ol]C[This move seems crucial.  Is this the right spot?  I also thought about R10, Q9, Q10, O8.  I'd really like to know what reasoning I can use to decide a move like this.

EO: It seems natural, since it's where black would like to play. In this case you are a bit too thin to ceil him in, but you should try to get some outside influence.]
;B[qj]LB[ok:A]C[EO: Black should probably cut through first, with e.g., A.]

(;W[pi]C[EO: Bad shape. You should only play it if you are sure it works.]
;B[ok];W[oj]LB[nk:A]C[I regretted P10 right away, wasn't sure what I was thinking.  But 08 seemed submissive, and then I'd given b two corners without getting much, so how should I have attacked?

EO: Well, difficult to find a good move here, due to your previous move. A is better, but still not very satisfactory.]
;B[nk];W[pk];B[pl];W[om];B[pj];W[nj];B[mk]SQ[nj]C[EO: This exchange is good for black. Your stones below are getting weak now.]

(;B[ri]C[EO: Terrible move. MUCH better to move out, losing sente here could cost the game. And the group still doesn't have two eyes.]
;W[np]C[P3 better, someone told me.

EO: Yes, make black low.];B[nq];W[mq];B[nr];W[mp];B[kq]C[I've gained very little with all my stones so far.  Things are going poorly for white....
