C[Dear Reviewer, this game was played on littlegolem.net with (almost) no time limit. I played black against someone whom I had lost against several times before. And again, during this game I felt like always behind. When I realised that I had killed the white top right group, I saw light at the end of tunnel.

Then white oversaw a cut in the lower left that defeated him.

I consider this game as the state of art of my go playing skill. Reviewing the game by myself I am not really happy with all my moves, but I do need some more qualified comment.

Thank you very much for your time and effort in advance.

Joerg

Edgar: Hi! I will be reviewing the game, and my comments are prefixed with "Edgar:".

Edgar Ibsen];B[pc];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc]
;B[ic];W[po];B[qk]TR[pk][pl]C[Edgar: This is rather low... and so far all your stones have been third line stones. I would be more inclined to pincer at Q8 or Q9, so that your moyo at the top is worth more. Here White has several moyo reduction moves, including P9 (which was played), and also Q10 which is more severe (but would probably weaken the Q5 stone if played immediately).

At this point I like White's balance a little more.];W[ok];B[pl]
TR[oj]C[Edgar: I would tend to go for P10 (or even Q11 if you want to be more territory-oriented), and build up a wall around there (or fight, in which case you have the upper hand).

I do like the pressure on the Q5 stone from this move, but I think a move at Q11 is very necessary as a followup, but that wasn't played.]
;W[oq];B[or];W[nr]
(;B[op]C[Edgar: This is not joseki (joseki given in variation). While I'm not a particular fan of memorizing (and playing) perfect joseki, I think joseki here gives a much better result.

The problem with this variation is that 1. it ends in gote (omitting Q2 would produce a lot of bad aji), and 2. you give white nice outside influence, and Q5 is still half alive (and emitting much aji). In contrast, what you get is not all that much...]
;W[nq];B[pp];W[mo];B[np];W[mp]
(;B[pr]LB[pi:A]C[Edgar: I would consider tenuki'ing with Q11 here, the aji notwithstanding. See variation.]
;W[pe];B[nd];W[ph];B[qd];W[ol];B[om]
(;W[nm]C[Edgar: I don't like this move, P6 seems better. A few variations are given (though by no means complete).]
;B[on];W[qj];B[rk]C[Edgar: This move is rather painful for black. I would tenuki here. The difference between the efficiency of White R10 and Black S9 is very clear here.]
;W[rj]C[Edgar: This is a heavy, inefficient and gote move by White. White should have tenuki'd and played around C9 or F3, or even L16/M16.]
;B[nn];W[mn];B[gq]C[Edgar: I would perfer an invasion on the other side, since White is weakest there. In this case I think White didn't handle this invasion very well, so the result ended up good for black. I gave the variation which I think is better for White.]

(;W[iq];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr];B[fo];W[dn];B[ip];W[jq];B[em]
C[Edgar: I think this move tries to do too much for what it is: it is trying to both run the weak group and decrease the white side, but I don't think it does either very well. I'd rather either try to make life, or invade completely with something like C10 (but that might be too early as of yet, since you already have a weak group in the vicinity).]
;W[en];B[fn];W[fm];B[gm];W[fl];B[gl];W[fk];B[jm]C[Edgar: Now White has a better side compared to if Black hadn't played E7.]
;W[gk];B[mm];W[nl];B[lm];W[pk];B[qm];W[hk]
(;B[in]C[Edgar: Perhaps now is the time to use your N3 cut (see variations) :)]
;W[ko];B[kj];W[fe];B[rg];W[pd];B[qc];W[lc]TR[ie]C[Edgar: Too greedy. Right now reducing with J15 looks very nice (plus it is sente).]
;B[nc];W[ke];B[ie];W[kg];B[hg];W[nf]C[Edgar: White gave Black almost a free move with the efficiency of the last few White moves.]
;B[eh];W[gg];B[gf]C[Edgar: I'd perfer G12; L13 is not easy to kill if White does not insist on saving every stone (M17 has to go). On the other hand, Black gets his E12 stone to stick, which is huge.]

;W[mf];B[le];W[jd]
(;B[jc]C[Edgar: This is way too defensive. M14 cut is very strong, and White is going to have some trouble saving both groups, especially considering how strong Black is in that area.

Separating your opponent's weak group is always huge when you have strong groups yourself, and should always be given due attention.]
;W[lf];B[jf];W[kf];B[mi]C[Edgar: Now we see how pointless M17 was.]

(;W[mc]C[Edgar: This is the losing move. White has a sente eye, and should take it instead of making it into a gote eye. See variation.]

;W[df];B[cd];W[bc];B[ch]C[Edgar: Good. White neglected to play a move there, and will pay unless he can calculate very precisely. The variations are too many for me to play out, but my feeling is that black cannot live there with correct White play... but that not easy for White at all.]

C[Edgar: Utter collapse for White.];W[ep];B[fq];W[bj];B[fh]
;W[dh];B[ns];W[ms];B[os];W[mr];B[cp];W[co];B[bp]C[Edgar: Interesting game. White was ahead a lot in fuseki, but made a few major mistakes. On the other hand, Black's playing was comparatively consistant throughout the game.

Overall your playing is solid and nice; however, you are way too defensive at times in this game. This may be because you perceive your opponent as a stronger player, but it is even then not a good idea. Instead, don't hesitate to be a little bolder and aggressive.

The problem is that some times you are both defensive and territorial. Usually, defensive players are not territorial, but rather like moyo (so that they can try to kill groups inside it or make territory trying to doing so), and territorial players are not defensive (so that they can invade their opponent's moyos). However, in this game you sometimes play too defensively, while being territorial at the same time. As a consequence, you don't make huge mistakes (unlike White), but if White had made a few less mistakes it'd be hard for you to win. Don't be afraid to make huge mistakes ;)

Good luck!])
