C[Hi, thank you for taking some time to comment my game.

I chose this game, because i think i made many big mistakes and i make those mistake on almost every game.

I tried to auto comment some moves and ask question on other moves, if you think it's interesting for me, thanks to comment my own comments.

al> Hi Damien. Looked through the game and found a couple of things:
- both of you seem to focus too much on local situations, missing out opportunities in other places on the board
- both of you attempt to capture by playing contact moves, which in several occasions gave the attacked group means to escape

al> on the other hand, you keep fairly in line with the corner-side-center guideline, and only occasionally there are moves completely off the wall. White lost mostly due to a couple of misreadings more than anything else, so i think you are doing fine - just keep playing!]

;B[de];W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[db]C[D: here, i'm not sure of that move, is D14 better ?

al> looking good, so far. black chose to go for points at the top, and white gets a fairly big corner in return.]

C[al > good move by white, exploiting black weakness];B[ed]
;W[ff];B[eh];W[ef]C[D: Afterwards, ithought there were so many bigger moves, no ?

al> this is big - it is important to not let black sew the wall together again. this way black has gained almost nothing in return for white's corner territory.]
;B[gd];W[qf]C[In this situation where should i attack ? Can i attack F4 stone ?

al> i think this goes in the wrong direction, since white is in effect pushing black to reinforce the top (where black got most of the points at the end of the game)

al> one way of thinking is to play elswhere, putting black to the choice of defending that spot, or outlining a moyo at the top.

al> another is to take the opportuity to reduce black's potential at the top by playing inside, aaround N17 and follow up by running out towards the center.

al> pushing at the lower right corner is quite playable at this point.]
;B[qd];W[pi]C[D: Didn't know how to respond :/

al> this reponse is ok, i think. it outlines territory along the side, away fropm the top, so black has to make a choice instead of being pushed to do something that is favourable to him.]
;B[rg];W[rf]C[D: R13 better ?

al> it depends on what you want to do: cutting is an attempt to make territory along the side, while R13 would strive to make a living group in the center that dould be used for reducing black's potential at the top.]
;B[qg];W[pg];B[qi];W[qj];B[ph];W[oh]C[D: what a bad shape for my stones ! Was r10 a mistake again ?

al> i don't think so. black's group is pretty cramped and due to that fact he can not cut at Q14 just yet. so black's shape is worse, actually.]
;B[qh];W[oj]C[al> now this is unfortunate - white is protecting on the wrong side. now black can cut at q 14, which will yield a huge top right corner fÃ¶r black.

al> white p14 would have forced black to choose whether to defend the top or the R12 group.
divide and conquer..];B[pf];W[og];B[sf];W[se]C[al> with t15 white is giving away points. to retain a possibility to reduce black's potential at the top, w p14 would be better (followed up by w o16). otherwise r7 could be logical, but i think the top is more urgent.]
;B[sg];W[re]C[D: I should have played elsewhere, what about r7 ?]
;B[qe];W[qn];B[rj];W[qk];B[rk];W[rl]C[D: R8 of course ?

al> yes, white r8 would make for a more solid white wall with a very strong influence towards the center as well as stopping black from getting so many points along the side.]
;B[ql];W[pl];B[qm];W[rm]C[D: again i let him escape to the center, big mistake ?

al> yes];B[pm];W[om]C[D: Again a shape to avoid

al> the price to pay in order to strengthen the wall, but the moment the black group gets out of atari, white has to fix the weakness (double atari) at q9.]
;B[pn];W[ri]C[D: Useless i think afterwards

al> yes];B[si];W[sk];B[rh]C[D: I still insist to attack a solid group, giving him so many points ! There are so many big areas left on the goban]
;W[rn];B[pk];W[pj];B[ol];W[sl];B[rd]C[al> black should have played t10 to keep white separated into two weak groups]
;W[of];B[pe]C[al> b t10 would create a totally different scenario where the white s8 group could be captured.]
;W[sj];B[sd];W[ri];B[rj];W[rk];B[nm];W[qq]C[D: Is this move playable ? (don't really think so, too early for this kind of move ?)

al> i think the top is more urgent, since black has such a strong shape to the right. somwhere in the middle of the top is huge for both players.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[cj];W[md]C[D : To pincer f4 stone would have been better ?

al> i think o16 is a better move.
the split at o15 is too obvious.
and after o16, even if black cuts there is a good chance for white to invade the top]
;B[ne];W[mf]C[D: Still a bad shape no ?

al> it is going in the wrong direction.
the object for white is to invade the top. n14 could possibly be used as leverage, but to me it would be more useful to play o16, follwed by l16 to create a live group.]
;B[me];W[le];B[ld];W[kd]C[al> this is pushing black to get a huge top]
;B[lc];W[kf];B[kc];W[jd];B[jc];W[nd]C[al> white o16 helps black to close the wall]
;B[oe];W[jp]C[D : Perhaps a good move ?

al> yes, it is a decent attempt to stop black from getting territory at the bottom.
it is better than w H4, since that would force black to jump out from f4.
black's groups on the left are weak and should be kept separated.]
;B[nf];W[ng]C[D: N13 ?

al> no, the black cut will be a failure - it is too easy for white to surround black once he cuts.]
;B[mg];W[lf];B[nh];W[oi];B[mh];W[mj]C[al> quite right - separate it from the closest black group.]
;B[lg]C[al> black shold have jumped to l12, trying to reach the e12 group.]
;W[kg]C[al> this is a good example of why contact play is bad for capturing.
imagine white playing at k13 instead - a looser net is often best.]
;B[kh];W[fq]C[D: How could i have attacked this stone ?

al> at this point, white should not attack f4, but keep up the pressure on black's n12 group, otherwise the white l14 group could be in trouble.]
;B[hq];W[gq];B[ep];W[eq];B[do];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[bp];W[bq]

;B[cl];W[bm];B[go];W[hp];B[ho];W[io];B[kq];W[jq];B[kp];W[ko]
;B[lo];W[kn];B[ln];W[on]C[D: Stupid useless stone no? Afterward i think this group was already dead

al> it indicates that white is out of focus. black has plenty of weak groups to the left to attack.

al> white's chance is to make as much territory in the lower left and in the center as possible, by killing at least one of black's groups.]
;B[nn];W[oo];B[po];W[el]C[al> again, contact play is not the way to capture.
the black group should be approached from the outside, something like g7.
while defending the group, black induces white to build strength towards the black groups above and in the center - one of them has to give in.

al> so. attack all three black groups at once, by playing in between them.]
;B[fl];W[fm]C[D : Misread];B[gm];W[fn];B[fo];W[fk];B[gl];W[im]
C[D: Can i say it was a bad move, but perhaps there is bigger move around J17 or H13 ?]
;B[gk];W[fj];B[gj];W[fh]C[D: E9 was too big to ignore it no ?

al> it has already gone to far.
by pushing at the black group from the wrong direction white actually helps black to connect his groups.]
;B[fi];W[gh];B[ek];W[dk];B[ej];W[ck];B[bl];W[an]C[al> white b9 would capture the three black stones as well. it is not always necessary to save a stone.

al> but even bigger would be to play somwhere around j11 to prevent black from connecting. white needs to capture the n12 group.]

;B[hf];W[hg];B[jf];W[ie];B[id];W[jg];B[ih];W[jh];B[ji];W[je]
;B[ii];W[ki];B[li];W[lh]C[al> the capture is not necessary; the white group is alive, and white do not want to give black a chance to threaten his way out by playing L10.]
;B[kj];W[kh];B[km];W[lj];B[jn];W[jo];B[in];W[jm];B[hn];W[hm]
;B[gn];W[kk];B[jj];W[lm];B[jk];W[kl];B[ag]C[al> black could have jumped to A14 (look up "monkey jump")]

;W[jr];B[ls];W[lq]C[D: misread again];B[lp];W[mq];B[mr];W[nr]
;B[nq];W[mp];B[np];W[mo];B[mn];W[ks]C[al> this mistake, and not capturing the three black stones at c8 earlier, cost white the game, you could say.
since white manaaged to capture the black n12 group, despite different mistakes, the game hinged on two instances of misreading local situations.]
;B[no];W[pr]C[D: Gote];B[or];W[ps];B[ns];W[qr];B[al];W[he]C[D: Quite urgent no ?

al> not really, the white group has two eyes and this is not a great reduction of black's territory.]
