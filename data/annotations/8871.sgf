AB[pd][dp]C[Hello reviewer,

thanks a lot for spending time on my game.
My playing style is reaching a new low-point at the moment, i lost about 10 games in a row and i dont really know whats up. This is one of the games, I hope you can show me my bad moves and maybe what are my main weaknesses in general.

greetings Sebastian


Tami - Hi Sebastian, sorry about your losing streak. Everybody gets them occasionally. I find the best way to get out of one is to take a break whenever you start feeling angry or emotional when you play. It`s practically impossible to play go well when you`re irrational and desperate to win.]
;W[dd];B[qp];W[nc];B[qf]C[Tami - of course this is fine and good, but if you play around M4 or M3 you get ahead even faster. Double approach joseki are tricky, but you shouldn`t be afraid of them.]
;W[kc]C[Tami - this is joseki but I wonder if White would have completed it correctly...]
(;B[kq];W[cn];B[gp]C[Tami - this move is difficult because it leaves gaps to aim at. I would avoid it if I were you and play an easy, but good, move such as F4.]
;W[dj];B[oc];W[nd]C[Tami - aha! White played a kneejerk move.]
;B[dn]LB[jd:C][pj:B][op:A]C[This is the first move, where I really feel like it was a great mistake, cause it makes him more stable and I got nearly nothing from it.

Tami - the problem is that you set up a wall with an ineffective extension (G4 is far too close so it's almost a "pass")  

A and B are big moves for you, while C would be a powerful way for you to erase White`s framework. 

A "rule" I learned the other day is simply this - if you are leading a moyo-building race, then keep going; if you are behind, then take action to break the opponent`s position up. Since you are leading, you can just play peacefully with A or B, and grab C if the chance arises later.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp];W[em];B[fn];W[cd]LB[jd:C][pj:A][op:B]
C[this move was a bit intimidating to me i felt like he really got forward and overtake my advantage, so I wanted to make a huge move

Tami - it`s a big move, but even so you`re still leading the moyo race. Again, I recommend choosing A or B and aiming for C if you get the chance.

It`s important not to be envious of the other player`s framework or territory - you can always build your own.]
;B[kn]LB[jd:C][pj:B][op:A]C[I thought this was a very huge one :D

Tami - it looks too close to F6 and G4. Besides, in the opening corner enclosures (A) and extensions (B) take priority over jumps to the centre (your move) and erasures (C).]
;W[np]C[this invasion was hard....Im always afraid of those invasions to make it myself cause Im always struggeling getting a save group
Defending invasions in my territorry is also a bit irritating to me...

Tami - instead of being irritated, look at it as the opponent sticking his jaw out and asking you to hit him :-) This is a chance for you to solidy some territory by attacking.]
;B[pn]C[anyway...this looked like the best move for me...];W[nn]
(;B[pk]C[...in order to defend my territory here

Tami - it`s good. You are turning the side into profit, and white is under attack.]
;W[mm];B[kl];W[pm]C[till here im really struggeling and i lost a lot

i thougt like "hey I am strong down there, should be no problem to deal with him"
but things came different...what got so wrong there?

Tami - the attach and cross-cut is good defence.]
(;B[qm]C[Tami - I think this was too submissive. You should always consider if the cut works.]
;W[qn];B[po];W[ql];B[rm];W[pl];B[rn];W[qk];B[pj]C[Tami - still, it`s not that bad - White has no eyes and you have some real points in the corner.]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[ph];B[qi];W[qh]
(;B[nj]C[Tami - the idea of sealing in is good, but allowing the connection underneath is a bad idea.]
;W[ri]
(;B[rh];W[rg];B[rj];W[sh];B[rk];W[rl];B[sl];W[sj]LB[qc:A]C[Tami - another bad consequence of this exchange is that the top right corner is looking insecure. An invasion at A might give you a headache.]
;B[sm];W[sk];B[rf];W[on];B[oq]LB[jd:A]C[Tami - it`s big but I would want to regain some feeling of initiative here. A would put you back in the driver`s seat.]
;W[nq];B[or]C[Tami - this is very bad. It`s very obedient and unnecessary. Playing unnecessary moves is almost the same thing as saying "pass".]
;W[nr];B[op];W[mk]LB[jd:A]C[Tami - it might be painful to lose a few stones, but just saving them is a huge burden that will cost points elsewhere. If I were you, I`d throw the useless stones away! Take the initiative and play A!]
;B[mj]C[Tami - by adding stones, you just make the burden heavier and heavier until you cannot throw it away.]
;W[lk];B[lj]C[Tami - heavier still];W[kk];B[kj];W[jk];B[oh]
;W[pg];B[og];W[pf];B[qe]C[Tami - the corner is still not 100%. The 3-3 point could later leave you scrambling for eyes.]
;W[of]CR[og][oh][pi][qi][kj][lj][mj][nj][pj][pk]TR[fc][gc][hc]
[ic][fd][gd][hd][id][cf][df][cg][dg][ch][dh]C[this felt hard.... this group has to live anyway, but i felt like cant do this without let him get his territorry (triangled) save...so i tried to invade there

and there he totally distroyed me...

Tami - yes, you made a weak and useless group bigger, and now you have no option but to defend it with pain.]
;B[mg];W[nf];B[dg];W[fg];B[eh];W[gh];B[fi];W[fk];B[gi];W[ii]
;B[hh];W[hg];B[hi];W[ih];B[ig];W[jj];B[hf];W[gg];B[if]LB[hk:A]
C[Tami - maybe you should get out of trouble wit A before attempting to counter-attack.]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[fd];B[ej];W[ek];B[dk];W[ck];B[di];W[cj];B[ci]
;W[kh];B[kg];W[lh];B[mh];W[lg];B[mf];W[lf]C[Tami - it`s lost now. This is the problem when you save worthless stones - you might not lose them, but you have to give up your opportunities in other parts of the board.]
;B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[ke];B[ni];W[ng];B[ol];W[nk]C[Dexxter [7k\]: thank you

Tami - the main things to remember here are to

1) Build your moyo when ahead; destroy when behind
2) Check carefully and cut if you can 
2) Throw away stones that no longer have any function!

Good luck getting back on form! I`ll be rooting for you.])
(;B[rg];W[rh];B[oh]C[Tami - he doesn`t have more than one eye, so it`s reasonable to seal in as much as you can and keep the pressure on him. Nobody enjoys having to live small.]
))
(;B[ri]))
(;B[om];W[on];B[qm]
(;W[po];B[qn];W[qo]C[Tami - it looks like White is drilling but actually there is nothing to fear.]
;B[ro];W[rp];B[pp];W[oo];B[rq];W[rn];B[sp])
(;W[qn]C[Tami - again, this dog`s bark is worse than its bite.]

(;B[pl];W[mm]C[this looks solid but too defensive to me]))
(;B[oc]C[Tami - this move is natural, and most kyus would play O16 against it]
(;W[nd]C[Tami - most players at our level would play like this but it`s not so good, because L17 is too near the wall. The right move is P18.]
)
(;W[ob]C[Tami - this is the way, but would your opponent have known it???]
;B[pb];W[hc]C[Tami - White keeps some aji in the corner and develops the top very quickly]
