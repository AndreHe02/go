C[---
Im groden playing white in this game

I looked through the game on my own but couldnt find the moves that caused the loss, actually I felt I was playing well so I would be really thankful for feedback.

Hi. I hope my comments will be useful.
My comments will be preceeded by <*>];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[gp]LB[cn:B][do:A][kq:C]C[---
is d5 the joseki move here? felt a bit slow to play
---

<*> yes, d5 is basic joseki. Followed by either "A" or "B". and Black "C".]

(;W[cj]LB[cn:A][do:B][kq:C]C[<*> this is a bit far. The joseki would be "A" or "B". to secure the lower left corner and extend to the left side. Black will extend then somewhere to "C" and white can play elsewhere.
Your move is also not attacking the upper stone, so not to good move alltogether.
See also variation.];B[kq];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nd];W[oh];B[qn]
;W[qk]TR[qh][pp]C[---
tried to punish black for not playing the joseki earlier at q10 and pincer r6 at the same time
---

<*> yes, black q10 would be joseki. But here also the white marked stone is under attack. Black might plan to give up his marked stone and get advantage attacking the marked white stone.
White has played four stones in a small area, whereas black has spread his stones better - this is an advantage in the beginning.]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[pl]TR[qh][pp]C[<*> black is making a "leaning attack" using his marked stone and the marked white stone is getting weaker.]
;W[mq]LB[oq:A]C[<*> this move seems a bit light. I would play maybe o3. Here remains the weak point at "A".]
;B[mp]C[<*> Black plays calm and builds in the center. Good.]
;W[np]C[<*> good.];B[mo];W[on]TR[pk][pl][qn]C[---
slow maybe ?
was also looking at P9
---
<*> good move by white. Keeps the marked black stones separated from the black stone on the bottom and allows white to get into the center.]
;B[rp]C[<*> good. Stabilizes the black group and attacks the base of the white group.]
;W[qq]C[<*> good. secures a base for white.]
(;B[jd]LB[ec:A][jc:B]C[<*< the shimari at "A" seems better here for black.  Or "B" slightly better than actual move. See variation.]
;W[dn]LB[do:A][fo:B]C[<*> better at "A". After "A" white can aim at "B" and flatten Black and build own wall.]
;B[gm]LB[fn:A]C[<*> right idea and direction. But more efficient at "A".]
;W[fl]LB[ec:A][cf:B]C[<*> not urgent now. Urgent is now the upper left corner to prevent the black shimari at "A" or to approach the upper corner at "B" to build own territory for white. "A" looks best to disrupt Black on the top.]
;B[dh]LB[ec:A]C[<*> better at "A".];W[cf]LB[ec:A]TR[dh]C[<*> attack at "A" more efficient. This move allows black to build a nice wall and also Black can use the marked stone now.
If you want to play from this side, you must play "B" and separate the marked stone from the stone in the corner. Still "A" is better here to destroy upper territory for Black.]
;B[df];W[ch];B[ec]LB[mf:A]TR[df][dh]C[<*> Black gets the big point and also has a partial wall on the left side (marked stones). It will be hard to white to reduce the huge black moyo on the top.
Now Black is already slightly ahead in territory and also has more potential to make more territory (for example with "A"). 
It will be a uphill struggle for white to get back into the game.]

(;W[di]LB[lc:B][le:A]C[<*> maybe "A" or "B" are more urgent now. See variations.]
;B[eh]LB[gl:A][mm:B][kn:C][lp:D]C[---
would g8 have been a good move ?
---

<*> g8 is at "A". Not an urgent move now. Top is more urgent. If you want to reduce the lower moyo a move at "B" is better. Also "C" seems possible, since the lower right white group is safe. and there is a possible cut at "E".]
;W[qc]LB[lc:A]C[---
now I wished to reduce blacks upper side
---

<*> yes, but instead of the corner invasion also "A" was possible (see one of the previous variations).]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[id]LB[he:A]C[---
felt I was so behind I needed to invade, hoped the weakness at d15 would help me

in hindsight this move looks strange but have no idea what to do instead
---

<*> maybe "A" to reduce was ok here. Now the right side is played out and there is not much of a weakness at d5. It is difficult to do much for White here. You are right to try something, as Black is leading.]
;B[ie]
(;W[hd]C[<*> too slow. Must be flexible within enemy territory. See variation.]
;B[je];W[fc];B[fd];W[gd]LB[gc:A]C[<*> maybe better "A" to try for a base.]
;B[gc];W[de];B[fe]LB[ed:A]C[<*> should be at "A". White gets now a chance.]
;W[fb]C[<*> good.];B[gb];W[eb]C[<*> good.];B[ib];W[dc]C[<*> good.]
;B[dd];W[ed];B[ee]
(;W[ce]C[<*> wrong side. Better live on the inside for White. See variation.]
;B[cc]
(;W[me]LB[cb:A]C[<*> better to continue now with "A". See variation.]
;B[md];W[ei];B[fh];W[fi];B[ne];W[mf];B[nf]LB[cb:A]C[<*> too small. Urgent is now to solve the issue in the upper left corner at "A". Big move for both players.]
;W[ng];B[mg];W[lg];B[mh];W[lh];B[mi];W[li];B[lf];W[kf];B[le]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj]LB[hi:A][qj:B]TR[kf][lg][lh][li]C[<*> Now the marked white stones are even weaker than before. After a possible move of Black at "A", they will be in big trouble.
But first the cut at B must be defended now.];W[ol]LB[qj:A]
C[<*> must protect cut at "A" instead.];B[qj]C[<*> desaster for White.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[pm];B[ql];W[qm];B[rl];W[rm];B[rk]LB[pg:A]C[<tomjk> now cut at "A" is dangerous for White. White also must be careful to live with this group now.]
