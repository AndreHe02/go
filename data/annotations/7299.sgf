;W[pp];B[qn];W[ql];B[pm]TR[qj]SQ[nq]C[I was thinking about N4 here, but thought I could leave it until the game developed.

review: Q7 is not a joseki. So I guess there's probably some moves that can make black look bad here, too bad i am not too sure it.

But if I were to play around here, I would do it around R10.

Or O3 if you want to play at bottom. N4 is too loose.]
(;W[de]C[review: Tenuki seems like a good way too.];B[bd]C[Unsure how to handle this, I decided to go for influence.  Perhaps a play along the left side would have been better.

review: B16 is an extremely bad move. You can just tenuki and look for the next big point on the board. P16 or K4 are the points that i would play right now.

Or if you like, B15 seems good to shut black in.]

I think I didn't get enough territory in return for Black's influence, then in the middle game I wasn't sure how to reduce the center.
The mistakes at N17, G15 and K19 just made things worse.

Thanks for reviewing my game.

John Stillwell

Conclusion: The game had been decided in the opening stage of the area. The rest of the game was just yose play.

White didn't manage to get a territory/influence balance and that tilted the game towards black in the early stage. I suggest you can get some opening theory and joseki books to work on.

Thanks and I hope it helps,])
