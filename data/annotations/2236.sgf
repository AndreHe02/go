;B[pd];W[ed];B[cp];W[oq];B[cd]LB[po:A][ep:B]C[Feels wrong.  Two stones on the 3rd line on the left seems to contradict the 4-4 on the right.  I would prefer to leave this corner for now as a 3-3 invasion might prove better later. I think I would play 'A' or 'B']
;W[df]
(;B[de]LB[ec:B][de:A]C[This move ends in B being on the 2nd line on the left if the standard joseki is played.  It seems to compound the error.  I would play 'B' and take the corner in sente them move to the lower right -- something like the variation shown]
;W[ee];B[cf];W[cg];B[dg]LB[bg:A]C[This is not joseki. B should play at 'A' directly. This just helps W make good shape.]
;W[ef];B[bg];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi];W[cj]C[Looks like B has lost the game already.]
;B[qp]LB[po:A]C[This just invites W to press at 'A' and buld more thickness.  This works too well with the top left.  Better for B to play 'A' himself.]
;W[ep]LB[cj:A][pn:C][po:B]C[This corner is uninteresting.  The position of 'A' means there is no potential on the left so B will not make a shimari here.  Hence there is no rush to approach.  W should play 'B' or 'C']
;B[eq]LB[po:A][np:B]C[This is uninteresting.  Helps W to get more thickness.  I would play 'A' to get some height into B's position.  If W  plays a second move against the corner ignore that also and presss at 'B']
;W[fq];B[dq];W[fp];B[pn]LB[po:C][kq:A][lq:B]C["Is
 a pincer around A or B better? Is A better than B  (as white can extend from
 the left with a 3  space jump against B)?"

No, a pincer invites trouble.  All W's stones are thick so don't go creating a weak group unneccesailty.  I would be more inclined to play 'C', but this move is also OK.]
;W[lp]
(;B[jp]LB[pq:A]C["3rd or 4th line invasion? I thought 3rd line was a bit  too risky but itseems to be ok."

Any invasion in this position is both risking and unnecessary.  Safe the invaions for later and take the corner with 'A']

(;W[jq]C[This is extreme cowardice.  Will all the thickness W has he should be rejoicing that B has offer up a target.  One possibility is shown in the variation.  There are, of course, many others but the general idea should be along these lines.]

(;B[iq]LB[ip:A]C[Highly dangerous.  B should follow the line starting at 'A']
;W[kq];B[hp]LB[co:A]C[B has made a very heavy group here between two strong W groups (left is strong because of 'A')  Nothing good can come of this.]
;W[co];B[bo];W[dp];B[bq]
(;W[cn]LB[io:A]C[To slow.  The side is of little interest.  W should be attacking B directly with 'A']
;B[in]
(;W[ln]LB[il:A]C[W is safe at the bottom so there is no need to play here.  This just chases B where W wants to form a moyo.  I would stop him with a move at 'A'.]
;B[gm]LB[ik:A]C[Not much of a threat against the left and not great shape.  Running with 'A' seems more sensible.]
;W[cc]C[Exploit my corner weakness...];B[bc]C[Very bad (see next...). I should leave the corner]
;W[be]C[Well done, I'm really in a bad position now]

;W[ck];B[bk];W[dd]LB[bl:A]C[Very bad: cutting in A kills the B stones!]

(;B[al]C[This looks like cowardice.  Hane is much better.];W[bm]
;B[am];W[bl];B[bn];W[dm];B[pq]C[This is no urgent.  B should take care of his center group.  "Urgent points before big points"]
;W[op];B[qk]LB[jd:A][md:B]C["Playing on the top (around A) was more important?"

'A' would be a disaster. It would just create another target for W.  If B wants to extend along the top he should go no farther than 'B']
;W[nc];B[pf]C[Bad? Should I rather pincer?];W[jd];B[lc]LB[pb:A]
[cl:C][fl:B]TR[gj][gk][hk]C[To early. B should prepare first with 'A'.  Better would be to stabilize the center group with 'B' (which threatens 'C' ) or one of the triangle points.]
;W[ld];B[mc];W[md];B[nb]
(;W[oc]LB[kc:A][oc:B]C["Playing A was more important for W I guess?"

It is big, but when B plays 'B' the corner is very big.  I think the double hane is more promising.]
