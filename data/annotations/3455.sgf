C[krv:
I'm playing black here.
Thank you.

This is my first review - I hope it is of some help. Andrew]
;B[qd]C[*si003*: Hi];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp]
(;B[qn]C[You have chosen a facing 3-4 point fuseki.
The direction of play is along the top of the board.
You may like to consider a quiet opening such as taking
corner territory at P17 (in the variation) rather than this
move which will induce White to approach at P16, as with
move 8 in the game.];W[np];B[rp];W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd]
;B[qf];W[jd]
(;B[ec]C[krv: Which moves here is the best?

Of the moves you show in the variations, I prefer the first.
(See comments in variation.)];W[dj]C[White gets the big move on the left.]
;B[qq]C[This move is small, induces White to become thick, and
reduces the effectiveness of an invasion around M3.
See the variation at move 16 (though you would
not play it now - this is just an example of the lost potential.)
This is a move to try and avoid, unless you need it to live
in the corner.];W[pq];B[pj];W[qo];B[ro];W[pn];B[qm];W[pm]
(;B[pi]C[This is a purely defensive move, and White takes advantage
by building a big moyo at the bottom. The 15 points you
are thinking about defending on the side are still not secure,
and K4 (or somewhere near there, maybe J4 if innvading)
is one of the last big moves left.];W[jp]C[White has got the big moves on the left and at the bottom.
This move alone is potentially 25 points.];B[ch];W[ql];B[pl]
;W[rl]
(;B[rn]C[krv: Is P8 better?

P8 is about 20 points worse. Your variation ends with the
group in the corner still not 100% alive, and if you secure
it the damage to the side is awful. This is why Q11 was
poor - the weakness around R8 and S6.];W[pk];B[hc];W[fq]
(;B[cq]C[krv: Should I leave this for later or invade with C6?

This definitely not the time for this invasion, if there
ever will be a time. With this sequence you cost White
about 20 points, use 6 moves to do it, and end in gote!
And you further strengthen White's lower side moyo.
The approach at C6 is far better, or you  might consider
preparing with E12 first (the threat of D8 to follow is
then severe, and you expand your top-left moyo.)];W[cp];B[bp]

;B[cr];W[dr];B[ap];W[bn];B[ar];W[ee]C[You've ended in gote in the lower left, so White is free to
damage your one remaining potential to build a large
territory.];B[lb];W[lc]
(;B[kc]C[krv: K18 is better?

A bit.];W[kd];B[mc];W[ld];B[nb];W[jc];B[jj]C[krv: I play here to reduce white's moyo. Is this correct?

Compared to White getting to play here and join all his forces
together, this move is worth 30 to 50 points. As White, I
would have preferred to play something in the centre rather
than K17.];W[ol];B[gj];W[ce];B[be];W[dd];B[cc];W[dc];B[db]

(Try to count in variant)

F10 (or maybe even better, E11)];W[eh];B[bg];W[fj]
(;B[ej]C[krv: Where I lose K10 group?
Which move is better now?];W[fi];B[ek];W[gh];B[fg];W[gg]C[krv: stupid move?

Not really. One way or another White was going to block
you in. The real problem is leaving the K10 group in
danger and not using the E10 group better. If you make
sure of their connection now, they can be used to
reduce White's lower moyo, pressure the three stones at
H9 and even keep the K10 group from coming under
severe attack. See the variation for one possibility.]

;W[hm];B[dn];W[co]
(;B[cl]C[krv: Here I need to protect K10 group.

Yes, C8 is small and the K10 group are a nice target.

Are white strong ahead?
Where are chances to save K10 group?

The K10 group is very weak - White will profit attacking it.
White's moyo at the bottom is under-counted by about 15
points, and the right side is weak. A couple more points
to White at the top, the monkey jump on the left - White
is happy.

The chances to save the K10 group are now poor. A couple
of moves earlier and it was OK.];B[me];W[md];B[kg];W[lg];B[lf]

Perhaps try to avoid creating many small groups. If you

Look at White - you have only managed to divide White
into 2 groups. Twice you chose to make a small life in
the corner, letting White close you in for very little gain.
Think more about getting all your stones to work together.

Several times you played for a small gain in gote. Try
to play so White must respond - make it *your* game
