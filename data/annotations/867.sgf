;B[cr];W[fq];B[er];W[cl];B[fp]C[I am not sure whether this cut is good.  It seems w is strong enough on left side and white will have time to help right side of cut]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[hq]C[F2 is an important move for b here, w wants to keep b separated, so w will probably connect and then his group loses its base]
;B[bp]C[B4 is not necessary for life of corner group, it helps white get stronger so F5 group becomes heavier]
;W[cn]C[D6 allows w to fix his shape and does not help F5 group, probably best to just help directly with F7or G6]
;B[dn];W[bo]C[The corner still lives if B4 captured, and w is strong already so it does not weaken white to save the stone, so best to help outside stone now]
;B[bq];W[dm];B[fm];W[hn]C[D6 is not a valuable stone, so best not to try to save it]
;B[do];W[co]C[F9 looks like a better why to move into the center]
;B[em];W[eo];B[hl];W[en];B[fn];W[kq]C[w seems strong enough on bottom, so b can use this opportunity to control the bigger area with R6 or R7]
;B[mq];W[qn];B[qo];W[pn]C[O5 creates a strange shape, but might be ok]
;B[no];W[qk]C[R9 is too narrow for w, better at R10];B[jm]C[K7 looks like it could be good, although it leaves many cutting points]
;W[kn];B[jn];W[ko];B[io];W[ho];B[iq];W[ir];B[jq];W[jr];B[kp]
;W[lp];B[jp];W[lq]C[b does not gain enough here to give up sente, and leaves center group weak]
;B[jo];W[gr]C[G2 was unnecessary for w, so be gets a free move]
;B[lo];W[ln];B[mo];W[ll];B[nl];W[kl];B[oj]C[P10 looks like a good pressing move]
;W[qi];B[jj]C[K10 seems too far, b has too many problem here, so must play slowly, perhaps just K8]
;W[jl];B[im];W[il];B[hm];W[ik];B[pl]C[The two w stones on right are too small compared to center black group, so b must contine with center group , perhaps G10]
;W[hk];B[gk];W[ql]C[White should also continue in the center]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[pf];W[lj]C[b cannot kill right group, so needs to help center group with G10]
;B[qg];W[pk];B[ok];W[pi];B[oh];W[oi];B[ni];W[nh];B[ng];W[mh]
;B[mg];W[mi];B[nj]C[Saving O11 is particularly small];W[nc]
;B[ro];W[gj];B[fk];W[kc]C[white should continue to press with F10]
;B[lr];W[kr];B[nn]C[It my look large to save 5 stones, but F10 is a critical move]
;W[om];B[nm];W[hc];B[qc]C[Corner is not largest area and can weaken outside group]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[pc];B[qb];W[pb];B[pa]C[ B S15 would help both groups]

;W[sd];B[mb];W[mc];B[lb];W[kb];B[fj];W[gi];B[ld];W[lc]C[B has real trouble large dead corner and two weak  center groups]
;B[kg];W[lh];B[lg];W[ii];B[kh];W[kj]C[Saving this stone is too small, b need to run, perhaps H13 or H14]
;B[ji];W[fi];B[od];W[oc];B[ei];W[eh];B[di];W[dk];B[ek];W[dh]
;B[ch]C[It looks like w can kill with c11, although it is not certain, because w also has some difficulties]
;W[cj];B[ci];W[fg];B[df]C[D14 is looks good];W[fc]C[F17 is small for w , here white can D18 first]
;B[eb]C[E18 is good for the area, but b must help L13 group]
;W[ih];B[if];W[hg];B[of];W[mr];B[nr];W[ls];B[nq];W[ns];B[os]
;W[ms];B[pr];W[ec];B[dc];W[fb];B[db];W[pg];B[og]C[B should try to save largest group, not 2 stones,
but may be too late already


General Comment:
Black should try to find the most important stones to help.

White should try to play larger extentions.];W[qf];B[nd];W[md]
