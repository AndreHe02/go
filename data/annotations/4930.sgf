so what has happened so far is that in trying to kill him you actually chased him right into your territory.  if you do that you had better make sure you kill!!! if you don't kill you are going to lose.  so remember, it's very hard to kill.  much easier to stay alive than to kill.]

Hi kaktus. 

I think there were just a bunch of small mistakes that added up to a big problem.

In general I think it would help you to think more about connecting your stones.  At your level people tend to concentrate too much on trying to kill.  Try and win some games just by playing defensively.  You'll be surprised at how often your opponent tries to be too aggressive and ends up putting himself in a bad position.  

Good luck!
