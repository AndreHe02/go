[hobbes]BR[24k];B[pc];W[ep];B[dd];W[qp];B[qe];W[cp];B[op];W[pq];B[qn]C[Hmmm. Usually this shape (R6,P4) is not good. Do you plan to sacrifice P4? If not, then it will be difficult to deal with Q5 by white.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[nr]C[Cut at O4. You can capture the  nstone at P4 or the one at O3.]
;B[mp];W[mq]C[This seems small. D10 or C14 is bigger. Always look for the big points.]
;B[np];W[lq];B[lp];W[qj]C[Good. Make black's thickness less valuable. C10 or D10 or C14 is probably still bigger, though. you have a moyo on the bottom.  try to expand it up the left side, too.]
;B[pl]C[Wrong direction. R12 is better. When you have a thick position, try to drive your opponent toward it, rather then playing close to it yourself.]
;W[qg]C[Good. White makes a base. So far Black has territory in the upper right, and thickness in the lower right, but the thickness doesn't work very well because of the white play at Q5 and the group at R10,R13.]
;B[jd]C[Good. Use Sente to make a moyo.];W[md]C[I would prefer C10 or D10, or maybe C14 followed by D11. Make a bigger moyo than black. When your moyo is bigger, don't invade, expand your moyo. Here black can attack both N16 and R10,R13.]
;B[oe]C[Good. Separate white.];W[od];B[pd];W[oc];B[ob];W[nb];B[qb];W[oa]
;B[pb];W[ne];B[of];W[kc];B[nc]C[K17 is better. The K16 stone looks weak, and K17 makes it stronger while expanding your moyo on the top left.]
;W[mc]C[No need to sacrifice these stones. You can capture the O17 stone with W-O16, B-N17, W-O18.]
;B[nd];W[lb];B[jc];W[jb];B[ib];W[nf];B[hc];W[dj]C[Perhaps the kakari at D14 first would be better.  If black blocks the corner,  you can take D11 and make a big moyo. Black is already strong on the upper left, so you get more than black. This is good, too, though.]
;B[dn]C[Dangerous. White can pincer and then make territory on the bottom while attacking this group. C13 ois probably better. Expand your territory while reducing whites' potential.]
;W[cl]C[Good. Make black run, and make territory while attacking.];B[dp]
;W[do]C[atari on the bottom and then connect is better. You probably cant kill black. Just making territory on the bottom is enough. Chase ablack for a couple of moves to strengthen your bottom territory and then play C14.]

;W[dg];B[eg];W[eh]C[I think taking at F14 is better.];B[cg];W[bg];B[dg]
;W[ci];B[di];W[ei]C[You need to connect at C10. The 5C15 stones are very weak.]

;B[fk];W[fm];B[fn];W[gn];B[go];W[cm];B[en];W[gk];B[gm]C[Fight the KO at D10 instead. You can't afford to sacrifice these stones. If they live, you can make territory on the top left while attacking the E12 stones.]

;W[pi];B[oi];W[ph];B[qk];W[rj];B[rk];W[lk];B[nj];W[rf];B[re];W[sf]C[S12 is the key point.]
;B[rh];W[se];B[sd];W[rd];B[rc];W[sc];B[rb];W[ri];B[qf];W[rg];B[sj]C[wrong order. Descend to T12 first. Then I think white dies. you can either connect at T10 or play R12 to kill.]
;W[sh];B[qd];W[sd];B[ki]C[Gote. In the endgame, look for forcing moves first. S5 is big, C3 is big, K2 is big, A16 is big There are probably others. Look for moves that expand your territory and reduce your opponent's.]
;W[li]C[No need to respond. S5, C3... are all bigger. Always take sente when you can in the endgame.]
