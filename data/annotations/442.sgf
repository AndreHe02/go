;W[cp]WL[559];B[ce]BL[583];W[qf]WL[555];B[po]C[c15 secures one corner for b, but gives w the first attack. I you ignore this (r14), then you should know what you are doing. In particular, the b attack at q5 primarily complicates the situation on the board, and gives w the additional chance of attacking q16 again later.]
BL[566];W[np]WL[551];B[qq]BL[546];W[qm]C[This move of w is very unusual, and complicates the situation even more. The result is that both players will have to fight with weak groups around this corner.
The normal joseki goes w r2, b r4, w p2, b r9. This is sente for w, since the points s2 and l3 are miai ("either/or") for living.]
WL[541];B[pp]BL[543];W[pj]WL[536];B[pf]C[Since w didn't defend the weak stone at q3,  the b corner can be considered alive, so the top attack becomes possible.]

;B[jc]C[The top right corner is still wide open (how do you want to prevent w r17 ?).
This is balanced somehow by the weak w group at top, but again, both players make the situation more complicated than they should.]

(;B[kp]C[I'd prefer k4, which makes better connection to the center, while still threatening the weak w group.]
BL[465];W[oq]WL[504];B[no]C[after w p3, b's corner becomes extremely vulnerable. It might be saver to play p6. This move threatens to lock in the w group too, but makes a solid connection for when b needs to escape himself.
This might be the place for a general remark:
Weak players often try to kill at all cost. This is usually not a very good idea. The more effective concept is to attack, reduce the opponents group as much as possible, but let it live. To do this, more distant moves are usually better, since they are less vulnerable to counter cuts etc.
Imagine b k5 and p6 here instead of the moves played.
W will of course try to escape with maybe n5 or n6.
If you now walk on with b p8, then you allready threaten to start an invasion on the right w group too.
This kind of play is usually much more effective in long terms (see the variation two moves back).]

;B[ch]BL[349];W[dm]C[w has neglected his bottom group and has a very hard time now to live there now. Both of the last two moves should have been at n2, b to kill, or w to live.
In the game, w lives anyway, but just because b didn't see how to kill ...]

(;W[ep]C[The rather weak "attack" of b has forced w to secure a huge territory in the bottom left corner. Say thanks!
Even now, w could play n2 instead for rescuing the bottom group.]WL[461]

(;B[nr]C[This move will "force" w to make two eyes.
N2 instead threatens to connect to the left or to expand to the right, preventing a second eye. This time w should say thanks :-)]

;B[qs]BL[181];W[mq]WL[375];B[kr]BL[68];W[or]C[W has read the situation correctly and lives.]
WL[354];B[je]C[B takes sente, and starts to build a mojo on top. Very good move, as it threatens the two w stones as well.]
BL[17];W[ro]C[Now this is a situation, it is worthwile to count ... If b omits s4 and plays m14 instead, which is bigger?
The corner will cost you arount 12-15 points. The top looks significantly better too me.
Of course, you first need to figure out, if you think you can keep the other b stones at bottom alive. W has a very unpleasant cut at m5.]
WL[348]
(;B[rp]BL[15];W[qo]WL[345];B[qp]BL[4];W[lf]WL[319];B[jg]C[This move can't decide wether it wants to continue the attack to the right or close up the territory at left.
The result is, that it does neither.]BL[866];W[gg]C[There we have the result, though w g12 would offer a better escape.
And the right w group still isn't really in danger!]WL[286];B[gi]C[You can't really keep w from escaping in a clean way. But you're probably better off if YOU decide *where* he will walk. G11 leaves the choice to w.

Your options here are
- play around E12, to seperate w from his strong group at left.
- play around H12/J11, to strengthen your center chain, and then attack M14 later.]
BL[688];W[eh]WL[272];B[ei]BL[669];W[ef]WL[231];B[ee]C[B would be better off with D12. This would seperate the w groups more decisively. The defense you play is not really needed. W will have troubles to make eyes in there anyway.]

BL[430];W[kd]WL[424];B[md]BL[304];W[jd]WL[393];B[ic]C[Now imagine K19 at K18, and you could just close off with j16 here.]

Too keep sente is allways important. But in the endgame it becomes crucial!

Ok, in reality its not that simple...
One good recipe might be to count often, for several reasons:
- To see if you're ahead on the board, so you can judge if it is worth to take risks.
- In a local race situation, to see wether your own group or your opponents has less liberties and therefore will die.
- In the endgame, to find out which moves to play first.

He who counts wins more often!
