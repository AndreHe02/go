C[I played white and the komi for this game was 6.5];B[pp];W[dq]
;B[pd];W[cc]C[I often play one stone on the 3-4 point and the other on the 5-3 or 3-3 point.  For some reason I've found that this suits my taste better than the 4-4 point.

csh: Let's look at the two plays:

Conventional wisdom says that the 3-4 stone (or the 5-3 stone) can surround the corner with another move, so usually Black will approach.

The 4-4 stones can't surround the corner with another move, so usually it isn't as important to approach them. They aim toward making a framework in the center.

The 3-3 stone takes territory in the corner, but it is harder to develop the corner into a large framework.

It's good to experiment with different openings. You don't want to rely on the fact that the other player may not know less common joseki. It is better to try to understand the meaning behind the moves, instead of playing two moves at random.

Keep these points in mind as we look at the game.];B[do]C[csh: Black's next move is to approach, that way you don't get the corner enclosure (shimari.)]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dm]
(;W[fq]LB[ep:A]C[csh: Playing on the third line does not aim to develop from these stones.]
;B[ci]C[csh: This joseki traded profit in the corner for a framework along the side.]
;W[jc]LB[df:A]C[csh: It's good to make an extension from a 3-3 stone. Next, playing a stone in the vicinity of A is big. It will create a framework (moyo) that you can solidify into territory.]
;B[mc]C[csh: Black makes a checking extension, and also starts to consolidate the corner.]

(;W[qj]LB[pj:A]C[csh: I'm not sure what to think about this invasion. It does have enough room to live, but it will be a small amount of territory. Even if White plays elsewhere and Black plays A, White can still invade. It's a trade-off between reducing Black's territory on the right versus developing your own territory on the left. This stone will not make much territory, only take away some from Black.]
;B[qm];W[qg];B[de]LB[qe:A]C[csh: Black can also look at playing at A and putting pressure on the white group on the right. Black's play also develops the framework on the left, so this isn't a bad move, either.]
;W[ed]C[csh: White's potential territory has been squished down.]
;B[jq]LB[rd:A][pq:B]C[csh: Looking at the board, Black seems to be ahead in potential territory. In part, this is because his stones are expansive and working together. His five stones on the left have created an expansive moyo. In return, White only received about 15 points in the corner.

It seems to me that the upper right and the lower right are unfinished. A and B seem like the proper points to play. I like B instead of the 3-3 invasion because it takes away more territory than along the side.]

(;W[qd]C[csh: I don't like this move or the sequence that follows. See the variation.]
;B[qc];W[pc]C[csh: This crosscut is bad.];B[rd];W[qe];B[qb]
;W[pe]C[csh: The ladder doesn't work, so White has to play this way.]
;B[od]C[csh: When you look at the black corner now, it's 100% alive. It's strong, and White can no longer attack it. Meanwhile, White didn't get more eyespace and his group still has open skirt at the top.]
;W[nf]LB[pq:B][qq:A]C[csh: Invading the 3-3 is probably more important.]

(;B[hd]C[csh: White's top group does look weak, but I don't think this is the proper attack.]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[gd];B[fd];W[ge]C[csh: This is playing to be split in half. White's potential territory has been cut in half.]
;B[fc];W[id];B[he];W[hf]TR[qm]C[I thought i could pull this off without a ladder but I think i was wrong.

csh: Yep. The ladder's broken by the marked stone.];B[fe];W[ie]
C[It worked out anyway though :)];B[dd];W[dc]
(;B[ec];W[be];B[bg]C[I always seem to get distracted during the opening and I fail to make the biggest extensions in favor of defending.  Were there any ways I could've done better in this opening?

csh: The invasion on the right was a liability. Black gets an extension for free (you have to respond, and he gets to choose whether to extend from the top or the bottom.)

When you look at the game, Black had his way in the opening. He extended to R7, and you had to respond at R13. Then he extended at D15, and then you responded at E16. Then he makes the big extension at K3. In short, he got to make all three extensions in the opening.

Instead, you might be able to trade big points. If Black takes one big point, you can take the other one. If you respond to his extension and then he takes another big point, you've lost ground both times.

If you had extended to C13, Black is likely to respond to avoid the complications from the ko.]

(;W[hq]C[csh: This trade is bad for White.];B[jo]C[csh: White has gained four points along the edge of the board, but Black has strengthened the border of his moyo. It also cuts off a possible escape route for a white invasion.]
;W[qq];B[pq]LB[qn:A]TR[qm]C[csh: Since the marked stone is here instead of at A, you can play this way.]

(;W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[ps];W[qr];B[rp]LB[qn:A]TR[qm]C[csh: Black isn't strong enough at the top to go for the kill. This would work if the marked stone was at A.]

csh: It's not really a picnic ko because Black has nothing to lose, either. It's a half-point ko (hanmoku ko.) If it was a closer game, it would be worth it to fight it out. As it stands, you are ahead. You can also look at it as good practice for finding ko threats. :)]

[ms]C[I won by 18.5 points.

csh: You definitely outfought your opponent,but if you strengthen your opening, it might be easier to settle your groups and get more reasonable position in the middlegame. Then you don't need to fight to stay in the game.

As a side note, notice how in the upper left ended up being a small group? It was hard for Black to attack the group, but it didn't get much territory. In part, this is because your opening move was a 3-3 point.

It might be helpful if you look at some books on the opening. I like the book, "Opening Theory Made Easy" by Hideo Otake. There is also the first book in the Elementary Go Series, "In the Beginning" by Ishigure Ikuo.

I hope you find this review useful.])
