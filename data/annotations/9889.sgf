RE[B+36.5]
RU[Japanese]

C[Hello I am your reviewer and if I am commenting on the same move as yourself, my comments will be preceded R:

And thank you for including your thoughts in the game record; this makes it easier for me to target my comments.

 I lost this game by a large margin due to a number of reasons, including some mistakes in protecting my groups, but I felt especially frustrated in not being able to build any valuable moyo, and being powerless in allowing my opponent build a very large one.

R : There was one very expensive mistake at move 48 after which you were always on the back foot.

Fuseki in particular was probably wrong, and I am very interested in learning my mistakes and what should be the rationale for better selecting fuseki moves.

R : There were no major issues in the fuseki.  Besides, in amateur games it is almost always the middlegame that decides matters.

 I am also weak at attacking, and even when some groups look vulnerable I often fail to find the right approach.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dq]C[B chooses a diagonal fuseki which usually leads to less moyo and more fighting.]
;W[dd]C[Are those fuseki moves right? I'm not used to 3-4 openings.

Don't worry.  At amateur level the fuseki is much less important than the middlegame.  

But to answer your question,  Black would usually make a corner enclosure now then W would approach the other corner to stop B getting 2 shimari.  4-4 makes a lot of sense for White who is a move behind.  This is because the 4-4 is geared to quick development and it is not urgent either to support it or to attack it.]
;B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[qq];B[kq]C[Black is now 'flat' on the bottom side and would have done better to appoach at R6 instead of O3.  Again, it's a small difference really.]
;W[qe]C[My idea here was to prevent a shimari and build something that would work with my bottom right group.

R : Good thinking];B[pe];W[pf];B[oe];W[qd]C[R : Correct.  You don't want B to take this point]
;B[qc];W[qi];B[nc]C[B is overconcentrated.];W[co]C[Was this the best place to play? I hesitated with the top side, but decided to "play away from thickness"

Yes.  Priorities :

1  Be first in a corner
2  Stop opponent making a shimari  [But note that there is no particularly good follow up to a 4-4 stone, so that's less urgent than defending or attacking a 3-4 stone.
3  Take a big point in the middle of a side];B[fp]C[Natural although you should notice that it doesn't quite connect to L3.  W should bide his time and not provoke B into solidifying this connection from F4 to L3.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[dp];B[eq];W[eo]C[Doesn't do much for White

1  B can reduce the influence of this stone while defending his side  
2  B can push you out of the corner territory with B3

Better to Play B3 or take a big point in the open spaces];B[bq]
;W[bp]C[OK.  Making the best of a bad job as they say.];B[br]
;W[cj]TR[gn][of][gc]C[OK/good.  Fourth line might be better but it's a good extension from both above and below.  I think White is doing OK in the fuseki so far.

Looking at the board I am conscious of the proverb "play at the boundary of two moyos".  So big points are
G6,
 P14
F17?G17];B[cl]TR[fo][el][ek]C[Now the fighting starts.  Be aware that your C5 group doesn't have definite eyes yet.  This is a diffficult decision and needs reading skills.  I'm not sure exactly what is right but you should attack this stone.  Consider 'leaning' the other way by playing F5 first.  With that direction, B has to let you strenghten your group and weaken his bottom side if he protects C8.

Then you can play E8 or E9.]
(;W[dm]C[This is a bit soft on Black, who can run out if needed, leaving your stones below rather weak.]
;B[cm];W[dl];B[ck]
(;W[dk]C[Possible to play at D10 instead, so black cannot wriggle out along the side so easily.  You have to try to read this  before playing E9 automatically.]
;B[bj];W[ci]C[Now Black can make life.];B[bi];W[ch];B[bh];W[cf]
;B[bn];W[cn]C[All this seemed quite beneficiary form me, given that I got nice influence and B's territory was not so big. But it turned out that I didn't use this influence well at all...

R: yes.

Influence is valuable when there are weak groups around (yours or the opponents) but that's not happenning in this game.  Alternatively, make a big extension from your wall and give your opponent the worry.]
;B[bg];W[bf]C[This may have been my big mistake.

R : This is OK, the mistake comes later.];B[cg];W[dg];B[df]

(;W[ef]C[Oops.  Just play E13 and you are fine];B[dh];W[ei]
;B[eg]C[Black bursts through the wall.  This is huge.  A wall with a hole is as much use as a bucket with a hole.]
;W[de];B[dg];W[fd]C[Makes a good corner but I would prefer to play on the third line as Black has a good approach move at H17.]

(;B[jc];W[hc];B[gn]C[Good play by Black, extending his territory and making your ex-wall weak.]

(;W[fm]C[Too tight to your solid stones.  Try  G8 instead.  It gets you out into the centre as well as protecting eyespace.  Standard extension from 3 stones.]
;B[fn];W[en];B[hl]C[R : Black continues to make territory while attacking]
;W[fk]C[All my nice influence has been destroyed with just a few moves... could I have avoided that?

R : No.  Not after black broke through at E13, although see comment at move 58.]
;B[nn]C[Good spot.  Junction of moyos.]
(;W[mp]C[I felt very scared of black's big moyo, and tried to do something, but that failed very quick. Was there a better way to reduce Black's moyo?

When things are going badly, it's natural to try desperate moves, but that can just make it worse.  When Black makes the obvious answer - as he did - is this a useful stone?  Nope!

The approach is to look around for weaknesses in B formation and try to find a place that threatens to make use of more than one.]
;B[np]
(;W[mq]C[This is heavy.  By this I mean that you are committing yourself to hanging on to a lump of eyeless stones.

Light means a formation that has the flexibility to let the opponent chop off parts of it but only by losing sente, whereupon you can move out into the open.  Doing it right isn't easy.  The first step is t change your thinking so that you are prepared to give up a stone or two.

Here's one example.];B[mo];W[hj]LB[nn:B][hl:A]C[Doesn't do much.  To reduce the opponent's territory without coming under too severe attack, play on the outer boundary i.e. the line between A and B.]
;B[kl];W[ie]LB[qn:B][qi:A]TR[pl]C[These last two moves strengthen the area round G14 but don't make territory because of Black E13.

Much better would be to notice the long gap between your AB stones and connect to secure the territory.]
;B[ke]
(;W[ng]C[Right idea (boundary of territories) but overlooks Black's push and atari.

It's also close to a strong Black position and only has a small effect on the Black territory above.

Q8 is more useful]
(;B[nf];W[nh];B[ql]C[Ouch.];W[qr]C[I felt concerned with the status of my bottom right corner group... was I too cautious here?

Yes.  You know you are behind so you cannot afford to be cautious. You have to attack Black's R8 stone.  It should lead to something good happening e.g. either capture or solidifying your stones or pushing a little into B moyo.

Having said that, the move you chose does protect your group and is quite big.]
;B[qj];W[pj];B[pk];W[oj]C[I prefer to atari frst at S10 and force B to make an empty triangle. It's quite significant in territory when you compare with the end result in the game.]
;B[ok];W[nk];B[om];W[or]TR[ib]C[OK all groups are safe and there are no invasions in prospect, so we are now into the endgame. 

When you reach this stage, it's really worth taking some time out to look round the board and identify the biggest points and which of those are sente.

This move is big but gote.  J18 is double sente 6 points, so you can play that first, then P2.

Double sente points are magic.  Free money!  Make them as soon as possible after the big middlegame items have been decided.

You lost quite a lot of points in the endgame.
If you get 
J18, S10 and B5 in sente
then P2
the game would be close.];B[nr]
(;W[oq]C[OK but not perfect as B can now connect underneath at P1.  ou should take a liberty off the black stone.]
;B[nl];W[mk];B[ml];W[lk]TR[ns][bo][rj][ib]C[I had the feeling here I was helping Black secure this huge territory, but couldn't find ideas to do something else.

Yes, but it's now too late to do anything about the big territory.

When both players have access to the centre from 2 or more directions, it becomes quite small.  The big endgame points are on the edge, particularly if sente.]
;B[ll];W[jk];B[kk];W[kj];B[jj];W[ki]C[Got it right this time!]
;B[ij]C[Mistake by Black.  White can save K9.]
(;W[mf];B[me];W[lf]C[The last few moves have gained you ten points in the centre.]
;B[ih];W[kd]C[Nice spot.  Can connect either way.

But J9 still works];B[kc];W[ld];B[le];W[jd];B[lc];W[md];B[nd]
;W[kf];B[hi];W[hk];B[ik];W[gl];B[il];W[gi]C[This loses sente after Black makes the obvious move.  Big edge yose are still available.]
;B[gh];W[fi];B[ff];W[hg];B[hh];W[oo];B[no];W[ib]C[Good!];B[jb]
C[Now you should play J17 to make a stroong connecting shape.  You don't want Black to take this point.]

(;W[fe]C[Your bamboo joint is Better than defending the one important stone, but I still prefer J17]
;B[rj];W[ri];B[rc];W[rd];B[ic]
(;W[id]C[Better to defend the J18 stone than a couple of points in the middle.]
;B[af];W[be];B[ae];W[bd];B[pd]C[Black seems to make a 1-point move.  Please be suspicious.  See what happened later.]
;W[bo];B[an];W[go]C[Please try not to do this.  I don't mean that it's technically bad (well, it is).  I mean that you are letting your emotions take control.

Black makes the very obvious response and you realise that you have no further threat.  You played this move just in hope without thinking of what would happen next and you are quite good enough to work that out.  This is desperation.  The trouble is that you have lost another two points.

Control of emotions is important in go as in many other sports.]
;B[fo];W[sc]C[Good to get here first];B[sb];W[sd];B[rb];W[of]
;B[ne];W[sj]C[I like to see  you getting these sente points.]
;B[rk]
(;W[al]C[this failed...

Yes; looks plausible though, peeping at two cutting points.]
;B[bl];W[ak];B[aj];W[ag];B[ah];W[ad];B[ag];W[ao];B[bk];W[ee]
C[Only one stone - black cannot push through.  Worth 2 points whereas H18 is worth about 10.]
;B[hb]C[Big.];W[gb];B[ia];W[gc];B[qf]C[I think I should have protected the cut and that it waas too late at this stage...

R : yes];W[rf];B[qg];W[ph]C[I probably picked the wrong group to save]
;B[rg];W[qh];B[sf];W[pg];B[re];W[rm]C[Big to get here first.  Well done.]

(;W[hn]LB[eq:C][fp:B][hm:A]C[OK let's see if felix makes a mistake.....

There are three groups of Black stones.  But A is alive anyway, so you have better chances if you separate B and C which each have only 3 liberties

So cut at F3 instead.  It shouldn't work, but still has better chances.
