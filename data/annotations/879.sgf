C[Game on IGS on August 21, 1999 between ScottK, black, and MacNala,
white.

Scott, I've done my best to comment the game. Anyway,  I'm not a very good player, so...

If you need more help, just let me know.



I have put in my questions on the moves I am most interested
in. (Particularly at moves 37, 105, 131)

You can focus on those.  Any additional insight you offer is
greatly appreciated.

I have added a couple of lessons I learned from this game.  Please
add to it if you see some general insights or particulars.

Lessons ScottK learned:
1) I need to learn more about timing.  I am not confident when
something is premature or if it is "the best defence is a good
offence."

-> Yes, but timing is something given by experience. Just three suggestions:
- look at the whole board, from time to time, to see what's important and what is not.
- don't try to finish things before it's time (yose moves)
- set yourself a goal and go for it (but be flexible enough to change it!)

2)  I need to secure my own area when I have the slight advantage.
Greed has caused me to lose alot.

-> yes, there's a japanese proverb saying: A rich man should not pick quarrels... it's also ok for Go...]
;C[Igc98 Generated Sgf File];B[pp];W[de]C[This white opening is quite extrange, used by very advanced players only... usual opening pos. are 3-3 (territory), 4-4 (influence), 3-4 y 4-3 (mixed purpose)]
;B[pd];W[ep]C[once more...];B[pj];W[ec];B[do]C[I'd like more C5, D5 is too close.  Now...]
;W[dp];B[co];W[cp];B[dl]C[Better D9, from a two stone wall (near the side) a 3 point jump is best.   You're a little bit over-concentrated here, and now he can C11 or something similar.

However, he sould L17 or near that point ...];W[jd]C[ok!];B[gp]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[fo];B[jp]C[once more, better 3 space jump];W[dj]
;B[ck];W[dk];B[eo];W[fp];B[cl]C[very tight move, maybe too conservative... and gote]
;W[el];B[mp]C[now he can shut you in the left...];W[hn];B[ld]
;W[jf];B[kc]C[small, I'd prefer M14, making a moyo];W[kd];B[le]
;W[jc];B[lc]C[small again, how many points could you lose if he plays there? You
can N17, reducing the loss to .. ¿8 points?];W[em]C[now he's shut you]
;B[dm]C[you don't need this move to live];W[en];B[jj]TR[jj]
C[ScottK Comment:  Was this placement of K10 too early?

Go Teaching Ladder Comment, [Name\]:

errr.. that's difficult to say, I'd rather play M12, but K10 cannot hurt

Anyway, you must clarify what you want to do: fortify your territory, reduce your opponent's... Now it's set up for battle...]
;W[jh];B[dg]SQ[qc][pg][li][lg][pm][jn]C[ScottK Comment:  Was the placement of D13 too greedy?

Should I have secured somewhere else first?

Go Teaching Ladder Comment, [Name\]:

Yes, a little bit :-) but it depends on the follow-up; if you try to give life to this stone, your gonna have hard times...

How about H10, entering his moyo before he defends? You can be confident of connecting H10 - K10 to your stones, so...

If he plays H11, you'll be in a difficult situation, with both corners open to 3-3 invasion, your right side so open, and M12, K6...

Anyway, the game is still open];W[eg];B[dh];W[ci];B[ei];W[eh]
;B[di];W[ch];B[fj];W[ej];B[fi]C[better G11, approaching K10]
;W[cj]C[now look at your isolated group, it begins to look bad...

btw, the invasion is a success!];B[ek]SQ[gk][hj]C[ScottK Comment:  E9 is too greedy.  This ends up costing me.

Should I have just connected at G9 or played at H10?

Go Teaching Ladder Comment, [Name\]:

I prefer H10, and don't understand E9, it's a gift for white!

You should consider defending your isolated group as soon as you connect]
;W[fk];B[gj]C[too close, better H10. One space jump from two stone wall are unbreakables]
;W[gk];B[hj];W[ii];B[ij];W[hi]C[Don't understand this move, neither]

(;B[ki]SQ[li]C[ScottK Comment:   Would the knight's approach have been better?

I believe this proves to by a major flaw.  After move 105 the
territory is about even.

However, I give him the chance to create a large area in the
upper left area while harassing my stones.

Go Teaching Ladder Comment, [Name\]:

Well, I really don't know if M11 is better, maybe, L11 seems to tight, but look at other posibilities: K6 is big, and I'd like to play (later) with g12, promises fun moments...]
;W[kh];B[li];W[lh];B[mh]C[now you've chosen: you should play K6 as soon as possible.]
;W[mg];B[lg];W[lf];B[mf];W[kg];B[ng];W[nh];B[mi]C[this is a very strange sequence all the way, but now, you *must* take n13 (play M13), and fight the ko, you can secure your territory, or, else, as it happened, let him enter the big way...]
;W[nf]C[second chance to eat!];B[me];W[og]C[big hole :((];B[ke]

;W[sd]
(;B[qb]C[Not necesary: look at the variation, starting with a "elsewhere" move by you]
;W[oi];B[oj];W[pi];B[qj]C[please!! k6];W[qi];B[rj];W[ri];B[qq]
SQ[il][jn]C[ScottK Comment:  What would you have suggested here?

Is this too passive? Maybe I should have connected at J8 or K6
instead?

Go Teaching Ladder Comment, [Name\]:

I prefer (I think you know by now :-) K6, 3-3 invasion are worth 20 points (if my memory works..), and K6 is much bigger]
;W[io];B[jo]SQ[ip]C[ScottK Comment:   A solid connection for my home area would server me better at
J4 instead.  Or is there something else I am overlooking.

Go Teaching Ladder Comment, [Name\]:

I prefer K5 better than j4, even at the risk of losing this two stone group, but it's not so obvious now]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[jn];B[hp]C[IMHO, that's a mistake, L6 to defend your big moyo...]
;W[ho]C[mistake again, this stones do not need help, better M6 or so]
;B[go]C[why? you could still defend the right side!];W[gn]
(;B[dn]SQ[bo]C[ScottK Comment:   Was this premature?   B5 would be a better placement.

Go Teaching Ladder Comment, [Name\]:

This is a life and death problem. I believe you're alive even ignoring the group, look at the (several) variations.

Anyway, the right...];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp]
(;B[ao];W[ap];B[an];W[bm]C[ScottK Comment:  B7 kills this group.

Go Teaching Ladder Comment, [Name\]:

yes, I think it does. The problem was A5, in my opinion. If you have played B10...

I've inserted a variation at A5, trying B10];B[bk];W[am];B[cn]
;W[bj];B[aj];W[ai];B[ak];W[bh];B[ln]C[ScottK Comment:  Where should I play here if I am wanting to secure the lower
left area?

Also, is this move premature.  After this, my stones around H4
are harassed.

Go Teaching Ladder Comment, [Name\]:

L6's fine, M6 too];W[gr];B[hq];W[jq]C[ScottK Comment:  K3 turns out to be a big problem for me to handle.

What would be a good approach from here?

I think you did fine, sacrifying two stones to save a bunch]

disregarded this attempt altogether in the upper left corner?

This will only work if he makes a BIG mistake; yes, I don't think trying this kind of measures is good practice.]
