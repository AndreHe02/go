C[Requesters comment:
I have read 'The Second Book of Go', and 'In the Beginning'.  'In the Beginning' was a little deep for my current understanding.  I have all of the elementary go series and am wondering which book I should study next.

Good for you! You will probably benefit from "Graded Go Problems for Beginners" at least the first books of the series. "Tesuji" has a lot of good ideas for moves and is not so abstract like "In the Beginning". "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" is probably both good and bad like you found "In the Beginning".  Go books tend to have insights for a lot different levels, so you can't appreciate everything on a first reading. With that in mind, I am going to take another look at "In the Beginning" myself.

I hope my comments are useful to you.];B[pp]C[Myshkin [22k?\]: Hi]
;W[dd]C[Aleph [25k\]: Hi.];B[pd];W[dp]C[I played the 4-4 point because I don't have a solid stratagy in mind.  I also seem to have a hard time holding on to the territory I think I am staking out along the edges.

This is common problem. To some extent you can't hold as much as you try for, but you lose some ground that you could hold. See later comments.]
;B[pj];W[jq];B[jd];W[dj];B[fq]
(;W[fp]LB[eq:A]TR[jq]C[I am still very unnerved by invasions in the opening.  Not sure how to handle them.

In this case, there is much to be said for playing at A, because your triangle stone will then give the invading stone very little room. I don't think the game move is bad either.

In a broader sense, we often don't realize how easy(?) it is to invade successfully. If you watch more advanced players, the board is often sliced up into small groups by lots of successful invasions. Often the successful approach is to harass the invading stone without killing it and thereby build territory or influence in an adjacent area. See alternate as an example.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[cq]LB[ep:A][eq:B]C[This way of handling the invasion is not bad either. You get big influence up the left side. I might have been tempted to add a stone at A or B, because a b play at A will create cutting points in your wall.]
;W[qq];B[ep];W[eo]C[This turns out bad.];B[eq];W[hq]LB[dn:A]
[do:B][bp:C][fo:D][gp:E]C[OK, you have the cutting points now, so if you are going to play here first evaluate the relative strengths of the b and w groups. B is strong because he has enough room to make life and he has nothing like cutting points to weaken him. Your game move could be interpreted as an attack on b by narrowing the scope of his stones. Maybe you didn't intend it that way, but it is way it looks to me. You should not attack when you are weaker than the opponent. Instead defend your wall with something like A-E. None of these moves are ideal, but that is the price you pay for getting a jump on b in the lower right.]
;B[fo]TR[hq][jq]C[With this move you know you are going to have to give up something. The triangle stones are relatively secure so don't worry about them. You would still like to keep the influence  up the left side if possible so...]
;W[gp]LB[en:A]TR[fp]C[A is better! Just sacrifice the triangle stone. It is the least valuable part of your position.]
;B[do];W[en];B[co];W[go]LB[gn:A]C[B wins the ladder, so a move at A would be better. There is a very motivating discussion of ladders in "Lessons on the Fundamentals of Go".]
;B[fn];W[gm];B[fm]C[You are right in seeing that this is not good. W is left with only a small group at the bottom.]
;W[qo]LB[qp:A]C[I am not sure about this move vs A. Both might be good. I do know that you play a lot of one space jumps in this game, sometimes when you should 
and sometimes when you shouldn't. How far to jump depends on how strong the adjacent enemy stones are. Sometimes you need to play 2 or 3 or more stones in a solid row. Other times a jump or a hane is a way to get ahead. It is a very complicated issue, but I think you might improve by paying attention to this.]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[pq];W[qr];B[po];W[qn];B[pr];W[pn];B[qs];W[rs]
;B[ps];W[sq]LB[rr:A]C[A prevents  subsequent small grab of territory.]
;B[rr]C[I think k10 would have been big here instead.

I agree. This is an endgame move.];W[rq];B[ss];W[pl];B[rs];W[ro]
LB[no:A][mq:B][rn:C][so:D]C[Both b and w are both missing the fact that b has an eyeless group that is in danger of being cut off from escape. Key points for both sides are A and B or thereabouts.

The game move is also on a good eye point. You would prefer to play C or D to defend this point and thereby get 2 eyes more easily.]
;B[mq]C[B sees it first.];W[gc];B[hc];W[gb];B[hb];W[ml]LB[mo:A]
[lp:B][qc:C][dl:D][cl:E][cd:F][mj:G]C[This is what might be termed a "neutral move" because it doesn't really help w or hurt b. It is therefore bad. You could still think about harassing b with moves like A or B. You could invade at C. You could try to exploit some potential to gain security and territory on the left with D or E. Even a purely gote but big defense move like F would be better than the game move. The game move invites b to follow suit by playing G which maps out a big sphere of infuence.]
;B[no];W[jl]LB[mj:A][nj:B][fl:C][hd:D]C[Since b didn't accept your invitation, you might play at A or B yourself as well as the prviously listed moves. The game move is too passive. It is better than the last move in that it would help the bot w group escape should the need arise or possibly build a framework in the center if you can subsequently play both C and D safely.]
;B[kp];W[jo]LB[jp:A]C[This is another 1 space jump that I am not sure about vs A. B gets some play here that he shouldn't but I am not sure that this move is faulty.]
;B[jp];W[ip];B[kq];W[iq]LB[jr:A][ms:B]C[A is much better. It gives you eye space, a claim on some territory and threatens to undermine b's group with a subsequent "monkey jump" to B. You can read about monkey jumps somewhere, but I can't quite lay my hands on it now. The group of 4 stones including the game move are a bad shape group that you should avoid if possible.]
;B[ko];W[jn];B[kn];W[kl]LB[km:A]C[If you are going to play here, play at A. It stops b cold and leaves no weakness.]
;B[lm];W[mh]C[This could be interesting.];B[jm];W[im];B[km]
;W[kg];B[mf];W[fl];B[em];W[dl];B[el];W[ek];B[gl];W[fk];B[gn]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[hl];B[gm];W[gk];B[dn];W[gq]LB[he:A][qc:B][oh:C]
C[This is small. A-C are much bigger now.];B[gr];W[hr];B[gs]
;W[in]LB[io:A]C[I don't think filling in this eyespace is needed, but if you are nervous play at A.]
;B[dm];W[ho]C[something lives!

I know how you feel but it already was. Many small moves by both sides. Big invasion opportunities for both sides.]
;B[cl];W[dk];B[ck];W[cj];B[bj];W[ci]LB[bi:A]C[No reason not to stop b at A. B steals a lot of your points in the next few moves.]
;B[bi];W[ch]LB[bh:A]C[Again no reason not to play A.];B[bh]
;W[bg];B[ag];W[bf];B[af];W[be]LB[ae:A]C[Can play A now.];B[ae]
;W[bd];B[ad];W[bc];B[ac];W[ab]C[should have cut him off earlier.  I was thinking he was wasting stones without gaining territory, not that he was taking my territory.

Good! You learned something on your own from your mistake.]
;B[ah];W[bb];B[gd]C[This is a big point.];W[ke];B[ld];W[je]
;B[kd];W[id];B[ic];W[ie]LB[hd:A]C[I would have played A. It creates a weakness, but you don't want b getting into the framework that you invested so much in.]
;B[hd];W[ge];B[fd];W[ec];B[fc];W[fb];B[ga];W[fa]C[Bad move but b doesn't see it...]
;B[ha]LB[eb:A][ea:B]C[B should play A followed by B and kill.]
;W[eb];B[jb];W[ee]LB[fe:A][he:B]TR[ge]C[This should be at A. As it is you won't be able to stop b from coming through at both A and B because your single triangle stone can be ataried.]
;B[ak];W[ph]C[Good!];B[pg];W[rh];B[rg];W[qh];B[qg];W[og];B[of]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[mm]LB[nm:A]TR[nn]C[A is better. You want to think about what an atari against the triangle stone is going to do to your perimeter.]
;B[on];W[nm];B[mo]LB[om:A]C[B should play A to use his atari to stick his head out.]

C[See why you should have played at A?];B[ff];W[eg]LB[fg:A]
C[A much bigger. Steer b to the narrower part of your territory.]
;B[ef];W[df]LB[fg:A]C[Mistake by both. Both want to play A.]

See earlier comments.];B[hi];W[ji]LB[qc:A]C[Your are safe here. You should try to invade at A. It probably won't work, but if you live you can win. You have nothing to lose by trying.]
