;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fd]C[Joseki has W at F17.  I don't know how  to punish this move though.]
;B[cj]C[Good so far.  Good extension];W[nc];B[pf];W[ne];B[md]C[I don't like this move.  It should be saved for  later.
White gets solid, and black gets nothing.  If it is saved
for later, perhaps B could cut here, and get a big profit.];W[nd];B[cn]
C[This  is in the wrong direction.  Since you are strong here, you should
attack the D4 stone from the right side, somewhere around F3.  Force
the weak stone into your strong area.
Another way of looking at it is like this... Where is the biggest area
on the board to play in.  Obviously, its on the bottom.  That is where
you want to play.];W[co]C[No.  White should be happy to extend to F4.   Bumping Black like this
lets Black have an ideal moyo on the left side.];B[dn];W[fp]C[The corner is  still open.]
;B[hq]C[Good move];W[kq];B[ho];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[pn]C[Good  sequence for B.]
;W[kn];B[ff]C[This is a good move, however the 2 stones on  the bottom need to be
re-enforced, since W is one line ahead on the right.  I would probably
make another one point jump, or slide into the corner.];W[gn];B[fr]C[I like  escaping out into the center better than trying to live
on the side.  I'd play J6 instead.];W[gq];B[gr];W[dr];B[gp];W[fq];B[go]
C[Making empty triangles is almost always wrong at this stage of the game.
Make sure you escape, first.  That way you don't have to worry about eyes.]
;W[fo];B[jp];W[jq];B[iq];W[hn];B[in]C[W has atari at J5 next, which is why  empty triangles are usually
bad.  Hard to say what to do here.];W[jo]C[If W wants a stone here, he should  atari at J5 first, then pull back
to this position.];B[io];W[kp];B[im]C[Good.  Escape];W[fn];B[ik];W[fk];B
[pj]C[Good!  Not only do you make nice moyo on the rt side, but your center  stones
have something to run to.];W[pl];B[om];W[ol];B[nl];W[qh];B[qg];W[ph];B[pb]

[ii]C[The game is hard for Black now.  W looks like he will get
the entire upper side of the board

at this point, B has ~56 points on the board.
W has ~24, but lots of potential for points on the top side.
I think the B stones can live in the middle, with a move at L8,
so I would play a move around J17.  Maybe threaten to cut at E16,,
then peep at G17, and try to secure life or escape on the top side.];B[jr]
