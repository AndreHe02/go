C[Not sure how best to respond to so distant an approach.];W[mq]
LB[np:A]C[This seems OK to me. Tha other normal alternative is at A.]
;B[qp]C[Would playing Q5 here have been good?

I don't think Q5 is consistent with N3. Taking the corner is the priority here.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[I think this is an overplay.]

TR[fp][gp][fq][gq]C[You come out smelling like roses. Black takers a few points in the corner but you get a very strong position on the outside and sente! 

B's Q7 stone is too close to your wall and would be bertter somewhere around R10.

Next for White I would play at any of the delta points off of the handicap stone.]
;W[jp]C[Your first big mistake. This is way too close to your strong group and quite overconcentrated. The loser left corner is left wide open.]
;B[pn];W[po]C[A mistake for black. He should save this move as it just makes his 2 stones heavier. This might be OK if he were to follow up on the right.]
;B[cn]
(;W[fq];B[cj]
(;W[dc];B[ec];W[cc];B[cq]TR[ec][dd][fd][pm][pn]C[Black is rushing ahead too fast. 

His two marked grouops are weak ahd he has almost no terriroty.\]
The weakness of these groups shold guide your responses in the corner.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
(;W[dq]C[Oh my... no.];B[co]C[This changes the lower left to black's favor. He has a large corner, his C10 stone is not so weak and your LL seems cramped.

Since the upper right is a 2-space enclosure you can put pressure on it]

(;W[qj]C[Looking at it now P9 feels better, would you agree?

Black's two stgones are heavy. They don't have any terrirory taking ability and lack good running shaope.

I would be inclined to go higher.];B[qh];W[oj];B[mm]C[
Looking at the whole board B's 3 stones in the upper left are weak so I would try to devise a response that put pressure there]

(;W[nm]C[Too tight. Mabye if you can read every variation and know that you cut its OK but even then B might be able to  build on the outside.]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[nl]
(;W[om];B[ol]CR[nm][om]TR[oj][pj][qj]C[The weakness of White's marked group is beginning to show more clearly.

Also white's circled stones have bad shape]
(;W[mj];B[mn];W[no];B[mk];W[ql];B[pl]
(;W[qk];B[lj]C[This is so painfull for White.];W[mi];B[li]C[Black has a considerable lead in territory and I think it is time to address that.

Here are a few ideas.]
(;W[ll]C[This move smacks of desperation. It also means you will looose the cut at M9 which could become meaningful later in the game.

Right now I don't see any hope of capturing the black center group so it is time to pull back and evaluate.]
;B[lk];W[jm];B[kl];W[fn]TR[go][ho][io][gp][hp][ip]C[Much too small. I'd sayh worth about 6 points. Essentially a small end game move.]

(;B[kn]C[Black drops the ball. Much bettrer options on the top side.]
;W[jn];B[ko];W[kp];B[mh];W[oh];B[nh];W[of];B[nj];W[oi];B[ni]
C[Horribly small for Black.

For White the top side is largest.]
