C[i am playing back here and will mark my comments wih "H:"





thanks to the reviewer in advance!

Hello derhannes ! I will mark my comments with a "J:"];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[iq]TR[pn]C[J: This move seems a little bit strange to me. Why construct a sanrensei if you invite your opponent to split it apart. I prefered Black playing at the marked point which is where I would play as White now.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[cj];W[cl];B[cg];W[cd];B[fq]TR[pn]C[H: i was quite happy with that start.

J: Yes I think you are right to be. However these 3 moves you're spent on the bottom side are actually quite slow. Luckily the last one is sente which gives you a chance to repair the weakness at the marked point.]
;W[dq];B[qn];W[pq];B[qq];W[pr];B[qr];W[op];B[po];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[qb];B[qd];W[pb]
(;B[oc]TR[ec][fc][cn][dn]C[J: This move seems a little bit slow. White is thin in several places. These spots could be invaded. Also Black could chose to extend from his framework on the left side. 

(see variations)];W[ob];B[nd];W[mc];B[md];W[ld];B[lf]C[J: Why pull back like this?]
;W[rf]
(;B[rd]C[J: A little slack. See Variation.];W[ri]
(;B[qh]C[H: my idea was to let him live small on the edge, gaining a strong wall towards the center. could i simply kill the black stones as well? how?

J: If you have counted the territory this strategy seems ok to me. Making your opponent live small and in gote is often better than trying to kill him and failing. (See variations for ideas)]
;W[rh];B[qg];W[rl];B[qk];W[rk];B[ql];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[pk]
;W[rn];B[rm];W[sm];B[ro];W[qm];B[pm];W[rm];B[gc];W[fc]
(;B[ic]C[J: Other variations are possible]
(;W[jc]C[J: White does not need this move. He could walk out to the center. See Variation]
;B[he];W[gd];B[hd];W[gb];B[ge];W[hc];B[fd];W[gc];B[ed];W[ec]
;B[ef];W[id];B[ie];W[rg]C[J: a gift];B[cn]SQ[lj][ek]C[H: this move made w run unto the center. could i have done something more useful?

J: The two marked moves would be better at staking out moyo. The move on the left threatens to invade at the point you chose.]
;W[el];B[en];W[co];B[dn];W[gl]LB[eh:C][mi:B][ho:A]TR[dl][fl]
C[H: which of the potential b territories should i protect? i thought, that A and C were more important than b because B is further away from the runnung whites. and A seemed bigger to me. but was that the right idea?

J: I don't think I would choose any of these moves. I would start by peeping (See variation)]

(;B[gn];W[on]
(;B[pn]LB[ej:C][nm:B][pn:A][ko:D]C[H: i don't like that move now. there would have been no real threat if white got A. the lower right corner would have lived anyway.


should i have played around B, C or D to build up territory instead?

J: I think that A may be forced (see my variation) but if you don't want to respond D looks nicest to me.]
;W[im];B[lm]TR[kn]C[H: the idea was to threaten white with a cut and widening my upper right territory at the same time.

J: I think maybe this move is trying to do too much at once. Again first I am tempted to peep to make the group a little heavier. Maybe If I had to choose a move it would be the marked point.]
;W[hn];B[ho]C[H: what would have been the correct sequence in the next few moves? my moves were obviously wrong as i lost the three stones on the left.]
;W[gm];B[in]LB[fn:A]C[H: playing A instead?

J: Yes A looks good];W[fn];B[hm];W[fo];B[go];W[eo];B[nm];W[hl]
;B[jm];W[il];B[jl];W[jk];B[kk];W[jj];B[kj];W[jn]
(;B[jo];W[kn]
(;B[ln];W[ko];B[jp]LB[lo:A]C[H: now i like A more than my move, which failed in disconnecting the whites

J: Yes A is better. My earlier variations give other lines.]
;W[lo];B[mo];W[mp];B[lp];W[mn];B[ji]LB[jl:B][mm:A]C[H: and again, A would have been *the* move. i just didn't see that he could get my stones round B

J: Are those 2 stones are small now. Isn't it possible to make more points?]
;W[mm];B[nl];W[ml];B[mk];W[kl];B[ll];W[km];B[lk]TW[jl][jm][mo]
[np]C[H: what do you think of this situation? who has more territory if black would not play as he did?

J: As it stands Black is behind.  Losing the 3 stones earlier was very big. In this sequence you also took gote. Now white has the first chance to keep sente in yose.]

SQ[be]C[J: What is this move. Can't you kill that white stone?]
;W[be];B[cf];W[mr];B[lr];W[ls];B[ks];W[ms]SQ[jr]C[J: note the weakness at the marked point.]

;W[re];B[pe];W[so]LB[rp:A][sq:B]C[H: didn't see that he was aiming at a ko here. should simply have played A, then B

J: Yes A is safe and if he pushes you take sente];B[sp];W[rp]
;B[sn];W[js];B[kr];W[so];B[jl]LB[jm:B][lo:A]C[H: that move's a shame. i somehow overlooked the connection at A and thought that he had to answer B. wrong. that's how i lost the lower right corner]

;W[lc];B[tt];W[ir]C[H: how could i have avoided this seki?]
;B[jq];W[hr];B[hq];W[hs];B[tt]C[J: you have 3 liberties right now. With only 1 move you put white in Atari. The seki was avoidable !!]

[mi][ni][oi][pi][dj][lj][mj][nj][oj][nk][ok][ol][pl]C[H: as it wasn't the lower right corner and the seki that lost me over 30 points, i believe that there were many situations where i made bad exchanges.


i'am looking forward for your review to see where they happened.





thanks again!])

[no]C[J: it is difficult to kill these white stones. One could try peeping to make the group heavier and then build moyo around it. If white tries to connect the marked stones the black groups in between will become connected and big. Peeping also helps these two groups stay connected. White may not have to respond to the peeps!!]
