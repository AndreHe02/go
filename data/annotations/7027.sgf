C[istournet [11k\]: bonsoir

Hi maest,

I spent a lot of time on this review so I sincerely hope it helps you a lot!  I think you play very well and it will not be long until you are single digit kyu player.  Perhaps you should start learning about LEANING ATTACKS and exploiting AJI.  Overall-board theory would help you the most at this point.  I suggest the book "Attack and Defense" by James Davies.  Overall you played a nice game.

jrm:  It is a little early to start reducing.  I've marked some big points for you.  A and B are the biggest, C is an urgent threat, and D takes the corner in sente.

The game will develop from here and it will become apparent at that point what the best way to reduce black is.]

jrm:  These are two important moves.  If you want the corner you should play A or B.  I played out a pretend line where W takes the corner.  Did you like the results?  I prefer to play  C because it ruins Black's moyo and takes side territory,]

jrm:  A is now more important since it seperates the two black groups.  White will be able to divide and conquer the weak, defenseless black stones.  

Since Black ended up taking a moyo with R13, he is sacraficing the health of his B group.  This means you must attack it!]

;W[oe];B[ne];W[of];B[og]LB[nf:A][qf:B]C[jrm:  B is better shape and it attempts to make eyes.  A runs out into the center, allowing further attacks.  A is good because it seperates the two black groups, but the point at B is simply too critical to pass up.]

N15 is more of a Yose move. It is slow and removes aji.  Can you find a sente move here?  E is extremely important.  F takes territory in sente.  G takes corner territy in gote (play this move later)]
