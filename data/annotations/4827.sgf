C[Hi, thanks for reviewing my game!
I'll add some comments here, stating what I thought was going on.

Ixiah:  Hi!  I hope you find my comments helpful in improving your game.   If your curious my rank on kgs was up to 4k but I have little time to play.  Hopefully after my CPA exam is over I can get back into playing more!]

Ix:  I think your move is perfectly fine!  Black has played 5 stones down here so you must expect his territory to be significant.  A move around A also looks fine.]

[eq][er][es]C[Ix:  Territory grabbing.  Black has become over concentrated.  All but one of his stones is on the bottom.]
;W[qo]C[Ix:  The proper move.];B[nq];W[qk]LB[pk:A]C[Ix:  "A" was also possible.]

C[Ix:  This move to me appears wrong.   The triangle group is quite safe (meaning survival is not a issue).  Now white should look to play the largest move possible.  Notice the difference in space.]
;B[mc]
(;W[jd]C[Ix: One thing I have noticed about white's play is the tendency to play on the fourth line.  I think here it would be better to secure the top left corner.]
;B[qf];W[qg];B[pf];W[qc];B[pc]
(;W[re]C[Ix:  In go you want to make a move that serves two functions.  This move does one (threatens the link up) but is not that useful in making eyes.  See variations for alternatives.]
;B[rf]C[letting black decend here cost me dearly later.];W[qb]
;B[rd]TR[qb][qc][re]C[Ix:  Good move by black.  White is dead in the corner. 

Here you have to avoid the greatest sin in go--HELPING your opponent win!   The triangle stones are now aji (potential problems in the future).  They have a couple of uses:

1.  Ko threats.  Anytime you have a ko your going to probably win it because you have almost a endless supply of threats to make these stones live.

2.  As play continues there may be threats to make these stones alive.  

So when you have determined that a group is going to die--DO NOT PLAY MOVES TO FORCE THE KILL.  You are helping him consolidate the corner.  Play elsewhere and look for possibe use of the stones in helping groups in the area.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[rc];B[se];W[pb];B[ob];W[ra];B[sb]C[this was unfortunate, maybe i should have pushed at s14 in sente instead of s15.]
;W[cc]C[despite the dead r18, i was happy with the game so far. Far too often when playing white I end up with very little pontential territory at the start, and then I have to invade,die,resign.

Ix:  You have a lot of potential.  The muyo of white is pretty big.]
;B[dq]C[Ix: A very big point.];W[cq];B[dm]LB[dk:1]TR[eo][cp]
[ep][cq]C[Ix:  We now begin a sequence with a lot of fighting.  The important point here is that right now white has one GROUP and one STONE.  

The triangles are the group and the stone is the 1.  The group has to live.   The stone can be sacrificed!]

(;W[cl]C[Ix:  This move is bad.  It creates two groups that need tending to.  With black only having to worry about one he will be at a advantage.]

(;B[hk]C[i'd like to play c2 to be sure that c4 group  is safe, but i didn't feel I had the time yet.

Ix:  You have to.  Losing that group costs white the game.  I am going to treat this group as alive for the rest of my comments since both players missed it.]
;W[il];B[gh];W[jh]C[Ix:  A good double purpose move.];B[no]
TR[gh][fk][gk][hk][fl][dm][fm][bn][cn][fn]C[Ix:  Here is a classic gote point grabbing move that is REALLY bad.  Here is why:  

With O5 black grabs a few points (maybe 6 or so).   The problem is he now leaves triangle stones open to threats to its survival.  EVEN if it survives it will allow white a number of moves that will secury much more territory then black's O6 and all the while attacking the black group (double uses again).]

CR[qa][me]LB[ng:A][ri:C][kl:2][jm:1][km:B][ro:D]TR[ki]C[Ix:  Okay...before going into a huge fight take stock.

A:  Not alive.  It has two potential eyes at R19 and N15.  There is also a potential conection at L11.  So if black makes life and has sente he can potentially kill it and win the game.  

B.  Totally alive.  It has two connections.

C.  Potentially in danger -- only 3 liberties.

D.  Slight danger.  Has 4 liberties and is near two possible connecting stones.

I think white needs to play L11 here.]

Ix:  I think the main things you should work on is:

1.  Try to play moves that have more then one purpose. 

2.  NEVER have more then one weak group in the same area of the board.   If need be, take that extra time to make sure one is alive unconditionally.  It will help you in the end.
