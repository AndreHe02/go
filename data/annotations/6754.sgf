AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi, Im David and i will review your game.

"5 stone handicap to Jaeke"];W[jg]LB[nq:H][qn:G][qf:F][nc:E]
[fc:D][fq:C][cn:B][cf:A]C[what is the best way to open a handicapped game?

I preffer other options, you may try to attack the corners on: A to H


also, what moves are important when the board is relatively empty?
The moves that can give you more space, in this case the ones that attack a corner. Remember, first the corner, next the side and at last the center.]
;B[lh]C[Again, if we use the principle that i wrote (First corner, then sides and last middle) the best move will be one that can ensure the corner for black.]
;W[le]C[The same for white.];B[ne];W[ng]LB[kc:D][id:C][kf:B]
[mf:A]C[block off black from connecting

The point to block will be A or B. In that way it cut all your stones and let you "floating". Remember that, beside the principle of order, you need to ensure a firm position for yourself. For that case you need the "create a base"  Iike C or D (for white).]
;B[nh];W[mg];B[lg];W[kg];B[og];W[lf]TR[mf]C[The groups are cut on the triangle the stones are dead if you cant make any eyes.
I suggest that you look at some better amateur games so you can catch moves that can give you more insights on this case.]
;B[li];W[mh];B[mi]C[i guess that the variation will be better.]

(;W[ni];B[oh];W[oi];B[nf];W[mf];B[me]C[This move was unnecesary. Your group is safe. Remember that big groups are alive even if you can see it (it not always like that, but that idea can save you a lot of wasted moves triying to live or to kill a big group.]
;W[kf];B[of];W[ph]C[AS i say before, dont try to sorround a big group. In this case try to take a corner or a side. It can give you more points.]
;B[md];W[ld];B[mc];W[lc]LB[fc:C][hd:B][gc:A]C["trying to confine black to corner"

Yes, you do that but as you see, you still doesnt have many territory. Black can attack at A to C so you can lose ground.]
;B[mb];W[lb];B[pe];W[pg];B[pf];W[qf];B[qe];W[re];B[rd]C[Black doesnt do a good job either, you need to supress the enemy. not to let he give you the pace (Advice: Play at your own rithm, dont let the other player give you his pace).]
;W[sd];B[rf]C[Big mistake from white, good move for black.]
;W[qg];B[se];W[rg];B[sc]C[Good, give blacks more freedom.];W[sf]
C[Not good for white. See variation.]
(;B[re];W[sg]C[Its better this way. See variation.]
(;B[ma];W[la];B[pn]C[Good move for black.];W[dj]C["trying to stake out territory in mid-left"

Even if doesnt look. Its a good idea. the best way to live its to expand.]
;B[pl];W[pj]C[Black doesnt need to play here. See variation]

(;B[nl];W[ll]C[Black can still play en the under side middle hoshi (black point). See variation.]

(;B[ln];W[jn];B[jl];W[kl]LB[kl:B][jl:A]C[how do you battle an attachment between two stones 'A' and 'B'?

The answer its simple and difficult. Crosscut. If you crosscut the attachment you create to groups for him and for you, so its better to think ahead a little. See variations.]

(;B[jm];W[kn];B[km];W[lm];B[mn];W[mm];B[nn]C[Not too good moves for white.]
;W[nm];B[kk];W[on]C[Big mistake.
See variations.]
(;B[om];W[oo]C[The best way to save a 3 stones groups its in the middle stone.]

(;B[no];W[ol];B[pm];W[nk];B[ok];W[ml];B[nj];W[ol];B[mj]C[good For black.]
;W[nl];B[mk];W[oj];B[lk];W[pk]C[There is no need for that move.]
;B[nk];W[gg];B[op]C[No need. Advice: you cannot kill that its already dead. Dont waste movements on those stones.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[gm];B[hm];W[im];B[in];W[hn]C[Easy cut, black fails to see.]

(;B[io];W[hl];B[jk];W[il];B[jo];W[gn]C[Again, an unnecesary move.]
;B[ko];W[kp];B[jp];W[lp];B[jq]C[White too, trying to live in the sand its difficult even for the plants. This means, that you dont need to waste moves on opponent territory if you know that cannot live. Remember something very important.
DO NOT THINK THAT YOUR OPPONENT WILL MAKE A MISTAKE.];W[kq]
;B[jr];W[kr]LB[gd:C][fc:B][fd:A]C["what is the best way to prevent black from taking territory"

As i say before, white cant live here, so you can secure some territory on the upper side. Like A to C.]
;B[js];W[ks];B[lo];W[mp];B[np];W[mq];B[nq];W[mr]C[Big mistake for black.
See variation.]
(;B[ls];W[lr];B[ms];W[ns];B[nr];W[ms]LB[pr:A]C[Good move for white.
Black need to protect his territory, maybe A will be better. See variation.]

(;B[or];W[os];B[pr];W[ps];B[qs];W[qr];B[rs];W[rr];B[nm]C[Black lose a lot of points and stills doesnt secure his territory.]
;W[ss]C[Unnecesary move.];B[lm];W[sq];B[ro];W[sp];B[so];W[rp]
C[Unnecesary move for white.
Try to think BIG if you go for the small, you cannot win.];B[qp]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[ql];B[rl]C[Bad for White. See variation.]
(;W[rm];B[qm];W[sl];B[qk];W[rk];B[ql];W[qj]C[Wrong move for white. See variation.]

(;B[rn];W[sm];B[sj];W[sk];B[rj]C[Mistakes for both. And black take it all.]
;W[ri];B[sn];W[si]C[Unnecesary move for black.];B[rk];W[qh]
LB[gd:D][cf:C][fc:B][fp:A]C[Too slow. Try Other variations.]

;B[ki];W[ob]C[Bad move for white, black doesnt need to respond. Remember that if you cannot make eyes on a place, you stones are dead.]

C[again, how do you battle out an attachment?

Push the opponent to a side where you are strong in this case see variations.]

C[somehow, i lost 108 to 60.5 to a 30k and I don't understand what went wrong. I seemed to have been doing well in the beginning, but at the end everything started to fall apart.

Well as i say, white only made the mistake to play a slow game (taking territory at the end not at the begging). 
I suggest that you see games of better ranked players on the GTL so you can grasp more ideas.
I hope that this review will be of use to you.

David.])
