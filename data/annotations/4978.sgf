C[In this review I want to know where I must improve and what are my weak points. I am just a beginner, so I expect that are moves much better then my moves...that is what I want to know...what moves are better and what moves are not better, So let's see the game!

===
Oi, tudo bem?
Ok, bear in mind that i can only give some general advice about your moves. I suggest you to don't give up even if you feel your opponents are stronger than you or you feel confused, distracted, or lost in any of your games. That happens to all go players including professionals, the point is to enjoy the game, even if you lose, have fun and relax.

As a general suggestion i advice to train with tsume go (life & death), and tesuji problems (fuseki, jose and shape problems are good too, but tsume go and tesuji are quite better for everyday training). 
www.goproblems.com is an excellent resource, you can download all the problems and replay them with GoGrinder or UliGo (both are freeware).

Finally, my name is Israel RodrÌguez Nava, i'm mexican and live in MÈxico City, hopefully we will met someday. My nick in KGS is cuetzpalin, you can reach me at any moment.

Ok, lets begin the review.
Have fun!];B[pq];W[qd]C[mairov [20k\]: vc come√ßou junto comigo
mairov [20k\]: rank nao diz nada

He's right, forget the rank, just play, unless you are in a tournament you shouldn't worry about 'even games' a game of go is an experience not a competition.]
;B[cp]C[Spade4A [18k\]: mas eu gosto de jogo justo];W[cd]C[mairov [20k\]: isso √© justo, nao se baseie no rank]
;B[qo]TR[qj][ck][lc][hc]LB[qf:A][cg:B][oc:C][ec:D]C[Well, this is not a common fuseki pattern, it's pasive and doesn't encloses much territory, you're building upon the side, leaving your left corner stone away.
It's a lot more common to extend approaching opponent's stones (A,B,C,D); thus if he protects the corner you can then play at the triangle marks near to the letters, sketching a moyo.]
;W[pg]C[White's fuseki is also not very efficient.];B[qj];W[ri]
;B[rj];W[qi]
(;B[pl]C[Is it necessary? I play this move becous I was afraid that oponent invade my territory...

===

It's overplay, again Black is playing very locally. It's better to develop other areas of the board, like extending over the low side. (see variation)]

(;B[ic];W[kc];B[bh]TR[cd][cg]LB[gb:A][bm:C][oo:B]C[At this time I thought I am playing good, becous I have three strong groups(A, B and C) and that two stones on upper left corner are weak. I am right?
===
Both have three separated groups, and both have secured big one corner each.
But it's white's turn now, with sente.
Nope, White's marked stones are not weak, they are close the corner and san san ('2-2 point', in this case C17) is not taken. white could take it and even if Black invades he will live.
Also, down left corner is free, and white can easily enter at san-san.

See variations, and study other variation by yourself.]
(;W[je]TR[oj]C[This move was good, I think K15 stone works good with P10 stone, am I right? What should I do now! Those stone help all the right upper corner and do a lot o influence on the center!
===
Well, this was a good move, but this wasn't the time to play it. there are bigger points in the board, Black can:
a) Tenuki and make a similar move, extending Black groupd through the center.
b) Take one of the left corners.];B[ee];W[eg];B[ei];W[gf];B[gh]
;W[ih];B[df];W[cf];B[dg];W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[ca];W[bg];B[ch]
;W[lj]C[So much territory for white now! And I just don't now how evade this with center territory...I just want some help, why I can play well but after all the oponent gets a big territory?
===
Well, this can't be answered easily, it's to early in the game and variations are multiple.
First of all, you gotta be cool, there are many options avalaible:
a) Extend from your big low right corner; when there's an opposite moyo near, you can threat to invade and build your own moyo in exchange.
b) There's the lower left corner to take.
c) you can play san-san and take the upper right corner. (see variation of move 166)

Explore variations.]
(;B[dq];W[eq];B[fn]C[Better to extend from your lower right corner.]
