(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]VW[]C[Two major comments for B:

1) Don't play atari or other forcing moves unless there is a clear gain for youself.  There were many forcing moves played by B where he hurt himself.

2) Play closer to weak stones, and further from strong stones.

W played quite well in this game.  He has a good sense
for where the big points are and won without much fighting.]HA[0]PB[dreamer]

;B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[ce];B[jc];W[qn]C[I would approach from the other side, so I can make
some territory of my own, rather than just taking away black's, but this move is OK.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[np];W[pl];B[qk];W[mm];B[jq];W[qq]C[It's unusual to jump in so early.  If black cuts off
the 4 white stones, he should be able to make a very big framework by attacking them.  If he forces the
3-3 invasion to live separately, B will end with sente and can attack the W stones.  So usually W waits
until his center stones are stronger before making the 3-3 invasion.]
(;B[pq]C[Not so good.  When you play the san-ren-sei (3 star
points), you are playing a power game, and your game plan is to expand your moyo until white has to invade,
then attack him, keep the initiative, and make territory
while attacking.  This move just tries to take territory, and lets white off the hook.  When you play the power game, you should let your opponent make small life in gote, and use the sente to expand your moyo further, or attack his weak group.  Since you have the outside, you will be able to attack easier, and later you can easily invade his positions.]
;W[ro];B[qp];W[rp];B[rq]C[Now you end in gote, so he can invade somewhere
else, and his group is a little stronger.  If you let the
3-3 invasion live small, you will have sente.]
(;W[qd]C[If W played at 3-3, I think you would block on this side.
So W is trying to trick you into playing as he had made the 3-3 invasion and you blocked on the bad side.

Don't be afraid to hane.  You have supporting stones down both sides so you can fight here.  Play more agressively when you have more stones nearby than your opponent.]

(;B[pc];W[qc];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc];W[dn]
C[This is a crucial point for B.  Ideally he would want to
attack the group in the lower right and make a big territory at the top while chasing it.

B has a wall in the upper right, so his plan has
to use it well, or he will fall behind.]
(;B[cj]C[Here again you are worried about territory.  You should
be thinking about expanding your moyo on the
upper side, so you can use the wall you just made.];W[cl];B[cg];W[gc]
(;B[if]C[Wrong direction.  This has no effect on the nearby W stones since they are strong.

You should expand on the side near W's weaker group.
The general rule is 'play away from strength, and near weakness (of whichever color)'.]
;W[nj]C[good move.];B[ok];W[nl]
(;B[ol]C[A theme for this game for B should be 'don't make unneccessary moves just because they must be answered'.  Pushing here gains black nothing, and forces W to fill one of B's liberties.  You should try very hard to avoid moves like this, since having one less liberty may hurt you later.]
;W[om];B[nk];W[mk];B[mj];W[lj];B[mi];W[li];B[lk]C[This atari is OK, since it reduces the liberties of the two stones so you can hane at the other end, threatening
a ladder.];W[ml]
(;B[mh]C[I would just hane at the head of two stones.  After you add a third stone, if you hane, he can still cut, and that cut is harder to answer without making a bad shape.]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[mg]
(;B[ng]C[This atari hurts you, since after W extends you still have to add a move.  White's move 58 helps him a lot to reduce your territory.  Your move 57 doesn't help you at all, just fills a point of your own territory.]

(;B[ih]C[It won't be easy to catch those 3 stones.  Try not to plan your strategy so you have to catch stones to win.
Chase them in sente instead, or force them to live small in gote, and make territory while attacking.

you should fill a liberty with this move.];W[ld];B[me];W[md]
(;B[nf];W[ie]
(;B[je]C[This move can't work since W can just atari and connect.  When you have staked the game on a fight like this take your time and read carefully.  If W can
escape, you must be satisfied with getting sente, or capturing two stones only.]
;W[jd];B[jf];W[ic];B[kc]C[If you plan to abandon these two stones, don't play this forcing move.  It loses you the atari in the center (which
could save your stones there later).  When you have two choices of forcing move, it is especially important to save them both until it is clear which one is more
important.

This move contributes highly to the death of the stones in the center.]
;W[kd];B[he];W[id]C[Now B has fallen behind.  W has more territory, and
B has a weak group in the center, and W can capture two stones on the top whenever he wants.]

(;B[fq]C[I don't like this move.  It gives B about 10 points of
territory, but W gets more in the corner, sl B loses ground here.  And W gets sente to attack in the center.]
;W[er];B[fr];W[ij];B[ii];W[hj]
(;B[eg]C[The center group is very weak, since if W pokes though the hole at K13, it has no eyes.  The group at the edge has a base, so it is stronger.  Play near the weaker group.

Perhaps B was thinking to play away from thickness, but the center group is not thick, it is weak.]
;W[gg]C[Good move for W.]
(;B[gi]C[This move can be cut immediately.  Play a move that is still connected to the big group in the center.]
;W[hi]
(;B[ee]C[The big group in the center is almost surrounded.  B needs to save it now.  This move won't help it connect out.]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[ff];B[hf];W[fe]
(;B[gh]C[B should live now.  This move just forces W to surround the B stones.  You can't win by sacrificing a big group like this without compensation.]
;W[hh]
(;B[fg]C[B can still live.  making an atari from the outside gains B nothing, so there is no need to sacrifice this group.

When one of your groups gets surrounded, spend some time reading to see if you can find a way to save it.]
