C[Hi, I'm stlWill playing as White in this game.

This is one of my many attempts to get into go, so it takes me awhile to get "warmed up." That said, this is a pretty accurate representation of my strength, with what I consider a "really lucky read" towards the middle.

Black is able to build a huge territory that I was never really able to make back up, any suggestions?

Hi Will,

I will precede my comments with "A:", so you know which were my comments and which were yours.
I'm not a very strong player, so please, read my comments with a grain of salt. I'll write my overall suggestions at the end.

Anyway, enjoy the review];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pc]C[A: It is considered more stable to play R16 instead of Q17. In this position it is quite natural for black to play around R15, which somehow presses white down. Probably nothing to care about at your level, but keep in mind that the very first stones define how the game will develop.]
;B[jj]C[This threw me off. Should I have responded differently? I was able to make territory between these three stones, so I guess it went okay, but I was worried about this play for awhile.

A: Yes, black stones form a rather loose framework. Nothing to really worry about. Regarding your move, on the one hand it is too small at this stage. I would have extended the left side, say D10. As white would then have E3/E4 as a good follow-up move, black somehow is forced to answer to this move (which is always a good thing). On the other hand, black has an excellent approach move at Q15, which would reinforce his framework dramatically. 
Now you know why a play at R16 instead of Q17 would have been better :). Nevertheless, you recognized that you have to do something in the upper right corner.]
;W[qe]C[A: Given that black built a loose framework and you already have a stone in that corner, R15 is too small. R14 is a good, solid option in this case.]
;B[jc]C[A: This is plain nonsense on black's side. Playing D10 is a very good choice for both sides and thus a big move (you don't only play a good move, you also deny your opponent one!). Starting an invasion is way too early, as no stone has been played on any side. Between stronger players, a move like this means a certain loss for black. Obviously your opponent is greedy.]
;W[eq]C[A: Playing low is the correct choice if you play in that corner. But! Black made a big mistake with his invading stone at K17. Chase it around with a move like G17. Normally, you will take a lot of territory in the course of it, while black lives small, and retain sente at the end.]
;B[ep]C[A: Interesting answer, I don't remembe the possible ensuing josekis, but IMHO black focuses too much on influence.]
;W[fq];B[fp];W[gq];B[dq];W[gp];B[go];W[jp];B[io];W[hn]C[A: You should learn not to play this kind of move. What was the purpose of this move? Which advantage did you get? You forced black into a strong position, seldom a good strategy.]
;B[ho];W[ip]C[A: You ended in gote.];B[jo]C[A: ... but black does not take the opportunity. D10 ( or even D11-14) would now form a beautiful moyo, especially with the stones at K10 and K17. Black also considers center territory more valuable than side or corner territory. Another strategy bound to fail. Playing at N3 is now big for both sides.]
;W[kp];B[lo];W[dj]C[A: Finally!];B[dl]C[A: And now you see why D10 was still a good move: A black stone at D8 is way too near to black's thickness.]
;W[ck];B[ch];W[cf]C[A: I think you know that this was not a good way to answer. D13 is much better.]
;B[eh]C[A: Black seizes the opportunity];W[fj];B[cl]C[A: Too small, white can never make two eyes on the side]
;W[gl]C[A: A wasted move. Both connections are weak and you connect to a worthless stone. Being surrounded by the opponent, you either must give up your stones or make shape.]
;B[ek];W[ej];B[fk]C[A: Your stones don't have shape, thus, it makes no sense for black to make this fact obvious.]
;W[gk];B[gj]C[A: One of the golden rules in Go is to never attach to a weak stone. Black should have caught your stones on a larger scale, by connecting C12/E12 with the rest of his stones. Your stones simply have not enough space to live.]
;W[gi];B[hj];W[fh]C[A: Very good play on your side!];B[eg];W[gf]
C[A: Given that your stones have no shape, it is the wrong choice to chase other stones around. In a situation like this, it is too optimistic to expect that both groups will live _and_ take a lot of territory at the same time. As you cannot give up your stones ( the G14 chain ), it is urgent that you make shape with them first. Black will take territory in the course, but you have to live with that!]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[fe];W[he];B[gd]C[A: Again, you chase black around, but your stones still lack shape. When black connects, he is the one chasing stones.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[ke];B[fc];W[db]C[A: E18 is doable as well];B[mc]
;W[me];B[hh];W[fg];B[ff];W[hg]C[A: Good!];B[id]C[A: Way too small. Worth a few points while Q10 or N3 is worth more than ten points.]
;W[ie];B[mq];W[lq];B[mp];W[pj];B[ql];W[qk];B[pl];W[nk]C[A: Now would be the perfect time to invade at R3. Remember, you will end in gote with that invasion, so probably, it is not a option for you at this moment (but normally it is worth it).]
;B[oe]C[A: Overplay by black. R3 is worth a lot more.];W[ng]
C[A: You have to connect your groups anyway (and loose territory), a cut at O16 does a better job at this.]
;B[oc];W[pd];B[od];W[lk];B[kk];W[kl];B[jl];W[ll];B[jm];W[kj]
;B[jk];W[nn];B[og];W[oh];B[pg];W[nh];B[po]C[A: Looks small, but is big. Very big!]
;W[ki];B[jh];W[ii];B[ji];W[hi];B[ij];W[ih];B[lh];W[kh];B[kg]
;W[lj];B[jf];W[je]C[This move was a mistake. I didn't see that I could make life w/ a play @ G12, so I thought I had to connect. Perhaps this should've been @ M13 to cut?

A: You focus too much on the current situation, take a look at the whole board. Right now you are in the endgame, where you should play all your sente moves. Thus, M13 is too small.]

;B[le];W[if];B[mj]C[I think this was my "awww... shucks" moment.]
;W[qi]C[My first attempts at finding my second eye.

A: I would suggest that you study the basic shapes. Then you would immediately see where you can make eyes. M6 is the only promising point, but it will merely make one eye.]
;B[rh];W[rl];B[rm];W[kn];B[ko];W[ln];B[mn];W[mm];B[mo];W[mh]
C[A lucky break on my part that I saw this. More a testament to the possibilities in a game of go than my playing ability.

A: It is a good sign that you saw this. Keep improving your reading skills.]
;B[li];W[mk];B[lg];W[km]C[A: Although your group has survived, I would not call it a success as you made merely a few points with a lot of stones.]

;B[ms];W[kr];B[dr];W[er];B[ge];W[jn]C[This was too early. I should've saved this as a ko threat.

A: Additionally, it it worth a single point. In the upper left are moves which are worth much more.]

;B[qq]C[I didn't even think of invading @ the 2-2... One of these days I'll learn my lesson.

A: When black played Q5, an invasion at R3 (the 3-3 point) become undoable.]

;B[qj];W[pk];B[pi];W[hp];B[ec];W[dc];B[ai]C[A: worth a few points!]
;W[ah];B[ka];W[hf]C[A: You have to connect here anyway. Let black force you to do this instead of spending a move on it! M4 would have been a better gote move.]

[lm][ml][qc][ra][rb][rd][sa][sb][sc]C[Those two territories nailed me. A loss by 23.5 points... *Sigh*

Anyway, thanks in advance for the review.

A: I think you mainly lost because you did not make eyes (or eye space) with your groups early on. Therefore black was often in a situation where he could force you and steadily fortifying his position.

As I said before, studying shape is the best way to improve your game at the moment. Knowing shape is good in a twofold way. Firstly, your groups become much more stable. As a consequence your groups cannot be attacked as easily as happened in this game (because good shape implies enough space to make eyes). Secondly, you know where to hit your opponent as you know where the critical points in his groups are and you immediately see when he makes a fault. Regarding opening theory and strategies related to invasions and reductions: It is difficult to grasp these concepts without knowing and understanding shape and thickness. 

Besides this criticism, I also like to say that you exhibited already some strength in reading and you made just a few faults common to players at your strength.

Hope you enjoyed the review
