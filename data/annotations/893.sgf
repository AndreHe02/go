;B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[pe];B[qe];W[qf]C[white
chooses a joseki that is probably advantageous for black here.  This should
only be  played when the bottom right corner is white, I
think.];B[qd];W[pp]C[Clever play by white to make the bottom corner the
right color.  Now white's two stones are somewhat light ... still the cut
is big.  This game looks interesting!];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp]TR[dj]
C[This was not a good joseki choice for black.  Black's stones
end up too low on the left side, all on the 3rd or even 2nd line.  Black is
going to have a hard time getting influence in this game.  Play 11 at the
marked point instead.];W[cq];B[ck];W[jq]TR[fc]C[This is a good move
by white to stake out the territory at the bottom and keep his groups safe.
The marked point might be good too.];B[qn];W[pf]C[owl: After the game, W
said that R10 would have been better. But I don't agree. Letting me cut at
Q14 would have given me a big chunk of territory in upper right.

My response: white's connection makes white heavy.  You can play to prevent
white's connection.  So white should be playing R10 or R9.  If you didn't
want white to connect, you should have cut there.  I think white's move is
a mistake.  Play R10 and where does white go?];B[qk]N[game]
C[This is too
far to attack white; might be better one line closer (you're weaker, but
white has a harder time finding eye space)];W[oc];B[ob];W[pd]
C[this is a bad move for white, fixing up black's shape for
him.];B[qc]C[the simple answer for black is good.];W[nc]C[since white goes
here anyway the exchange of the last two moves should have been left
unplayed.];B[rp]TR[fc]C[this move is very small since black is already alive.
The upper side (around the marked point) is much bigger.  Or invade 3-3
directly.];W[qq]TR[ed]C[Answering black's low move is silly since
black is already alive and there's still an invasion left on the lower side
anyway.  White should play around the marked point instead, I
think.];B[nb]C[this is bad for black; black gains one point while white
gets lots of outward influence ...black will have to very carefully avoid
making weak groups the rest of the game (the invasion of the lower side is
looking unlikely now)];W[mc];B[mb]C[this is terrible for black!  Keep
pushing?  Each push loses points.  Play F17!

The first push I might understand as otherwise white's block looks severe,
but once you've pushed once there's no need to push at
all.];W[lc];B[ec]C[owl: I thought a long time about this move. My strategy
was territory-oriented from the beginning. W had these big walls in upper
right. Should I spoil his plans by a play around K10 or follow my strategy?
I chose territory.

My response:  You have to play safe now.  White is very strong on the
outside, while ALL your stones are on the 3rd line or are enclosed.  Black
cannot afford to spend time on territory; black already has the lead in
territory.  Black needs to make influence.  A cap at K5 might be possible
(NOT an invasion), or a vague move around K10 like you suggest.  If you
think of E17 as defending the weak C16 stone, you've got the right idea.
If you're thinking about making territory, forget it.  You need influence!]
;W[ch]LB[co:a][bo:b][dn:c][cm:d][kn:e]C[A little premature for white.  I
would try to expand the lower-side moyo first, hoping to tempt black into
invading, and then attack black's invading stones.  Sequences like
a-b-c-d-e look interesting to me.];B[df]TR[np]C[owl: Maybe C14 better? My idea
was to build a moyo in upper left while attacking W's C12.

My response: I think your move is better.  You have life in the corner, so
just keep white weak.  C14 would make more territory, but you don't need
territory; you need influence (in the long run, you'd like to be strong
enough to invade the lower right around the marked
point)];W[bf]C[White probably doesn't have space for eyes here so
just jumping out is probably best.];B[be]TR[bd]C["Don't touch what you're
attacking" is a proverb.  Hold back one line and make yourself more
solid.];W[cf];B[ce]C[If B15 was at B16 then this move could be at D15
instead.];W[dg]C[White's shape is starting to look good
already.];B[ef];W[np]C[White's defense here is good; you can't attack
white's weak group on the left side very hard because white has so much
outward power.];B[lq]C[Whoa!  This invasion is too deep.  White has all the
outward strength.  A cap at K5, maybe, but this move is going to get you in
trouble one way or another.];W[lp]LB[kq:a][kp:b][jr:c]C[White doesn't attack to hard, so black can probably make a
reasonable life now with a-b-c as the
start.];B[hq]C[yikes!  another overplay for black, I
think.];W[jp]C[Now the stone on the right is dead, and the stone on the
left is in trouble.];B[ho];W[fn];B[hm];W[fl];B[hk];W[hi];B[jn]
LB[jl:A][gj:B]C[owl: I was
not sure what to do here. I was afraid that W could cut thru my stones on
the H line. And I didn't want to weaken my lower left corner.

My response: your lower left corner is alive, so don't worry about it.  The
move you chose has no effect on white, so it's not going to help you too
much.  However following up around A does give you a start on some eye
shape.

Still, if you play around B, white has two weak-ish groups, one above and
one below, so you should be able to fight fairly well.];W[gj]
C[owl: Did I miss something here?

My response: White gets the key point: black is now swimming in a sea of
white with no friends to link up to, and white's groups on the left side
are almost connected.  So black has no targets for attack.  White has all
the influence.  This game is in white's control now.

Just look at your lower center group: where is it going to make eyes?
Which stones is it going to link up with?  There's no answer to those
questions, so white has gotten the key point with this
move.];B[eg];W[eh];B[bq]C[this is small; you are already going to live
here.  Your other group is much more in need of
defense!];W[ln];B[ir];W[jr];B[fr]C[trying to eke out eye space ... black
may just live here.];W[pj]LB[pk:B]C[owl: I can *see* what W wants to get in upper
right center. But what else can I do?

Answer: actually the white territory there is not the big deal.  The big
deal is the weakness of your group in the middle bottom.  Play the other
direction (at B) to reach a helping hand toward it.];B[qj];W[qi]
;B[ri];W[qh];B[rh]C[owl: Small];W[jj]C[YOu can see your group is in
trouble and so white will get his way in this game.  You can't fight your
way into white's big moyo until your group has life.

The pushing moves at the top are looking bad now
too.];B[gk];W[fk];B[dr]C[Now black is almost alive but at the cost of how
many small gote moves?

White has gotten the outside in a big way while black has just barely
lived.];W[fh];B[eo];W[fo];B[ep];W[dm];B[cm];W[eq];B[dq];W[do]
;B[fq];W[dn]C[THat whole exchange
looks pretty small ... count the points there, and compare it to a move
like H16 or something.];B[lj]LB[hd:A][hf:B][ok:C]C[owl: Now it becomes messy. I want to reduce
W's moyo. But what is the right way? H17 or J17? Simply make the upper left
big while letting W get a big center?

Answer: white still has all the outward power, though at least black's
groups are alive now.  Still, when reducing a moyo, start out connected to
things that are alive.  Points A, B, or C might work; you jumped in too
far.];W[kl];B[nk];W[pk]C[Remember way back when I suggested that in answer to
the shoulder hit you should have played here?  Now white gets this point
and you see how much more it would be worth to have a stone here (getting
into the center!)

The big lesson in this game for you is that once you have some territory,
don't keep taking more; get some influence, get out into the center.  You
got lots of territory at the beginning with your low moves while white got
control of the center.  Then in situations like this one you took a few
more points along the side while white's center got even stronger.]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[pm];W[om]LB[nl:B]C[White should play at B instead to catch your two
stones in the middle.];B[pi]LB[oi:B]C[White could think about just giving
up the two stones with B to seal off the middle more
firmly.];W[ph];B[on];W[oi];B[nm];W[ok];B[mn]C[Nice job by black, linking
up.];W[nl];B[ml];W[no];B[nn];W[po];B[pn];W[lm];B[mm];W[lk];B[mk]
;W[mj];B[nj];W[mi];B[ni]C[owl: This turned out
better than I thought. I think W made some mistakes. But still the
situation is unchanged.];W[nh];B[jc]C[owl: I know that H17 or J17 would be
better. But at this moment, I had the idea to destroy most of W upper right
center moyo. And K17 should create some aji to help me do that. Crazy idea.
Anyway, who is ahead at this point?


Answer: actually this move is reasonable, since L or M18 should link it up.

The score looks fairly close now; the way the upper side is split might
decide the game.  The problem is that white has a lot more outward power so
it's likely white will gain more along the upper side.];W[hc]
;B[je]C[Just the diagonal (where white is about to play) is better.
It has more of a threat to link up to the left, and it's harder to cut (so
playing L18 might link up to the right,too).

Don't think about taking away all white's territory; just make sure you
get out alive!];W[id];B[kc];W[lb]C[Now black is going to have some trouble
linking to either side...];B[kb];W[la];B[hf];W[jd];B[kg];W[gf]
;B[ge];W[he];B[gg];W[if];B[hg];W[jf];B[gd];W[hd]C[So white seals off
a pretty big area with just a small sacrifice.  White has gained a LOT in
this exchange.  You needed to think more about keeping your K17 stone
connected one way or the other...];B[ih];W[ig];B[hh];W[jh];B[ii]
;W[ij];B[ji];W[kh];B[ki];W[lh];B[gc];W[bj];B[hb];W[ib];B[ic]
;W[kd];B[ia];W[ja]C[owl: Ok, I did not reach my
goal. W's territory is big, mine is smaller than it should be. But at least
I have kept sente for some other important moves...

Answer: yes, and the game is still perhaps within reach.  But overall black
has shown an inconsistent approach: first trying for territory, then
suddenly invading, then sacrificing the invasion for very little in
return...];B[cj];W[bi];B[rq]C[Now that is a big point.];W[bl]
C[Also very big.];B[cl];W[bk]C[pretty big too,  at this late
stage.];B[mo];W[lo];B[mp];W[mq];B[or]C[owl: right move?

Answer: looks good on shape, since you can cut on the left or link up to
the right.  The only thing that looks like it might be better by a point or
two is to cut first and then play here.];W[nr];B[qr];W[oq];B[pr]
;W[os];B[hj];W[kj];B[li];W[mh];B[gb];W[ha];B[ll]C[hm, that's a
big one too.];W[ik]LB[jm:B]C[silly white!  just connect at
B.];B[il];W[jm];B[kk];W[cp]C[A big sente
move.];B[cr];W[bm];B[bo];W[bn];B[co];W[in];B[io];W[jo];B[hn]
;W[re]C[yes, this hane-and-connect is pretty
big.];B[rd];W[rg];B[qp];W[lr];B[er];W[gi];B[gh];W[fg]LB[lk:X]
C[owl: Now this is the funniest thing in this game. I did
NOT see that my group around J11 was in atari. I only looked at the
possible atari at F10 which W has to answer at E10 to prevent a capture of
his stones in lower left.

In fact, the problem to think about was totally different...

Answer: yes.  In fact it was very big to capturethe stone at X earlier
because now you're linked up all the way across ... if only you capture
now.];B[fj]LB[ej:a][lk:b]TR[ik][ij][jj][kj]C[owl: Now W has the choice of capturing
my group or saving his stones in lower left. Which is bigger?

Answer: capturing your stones also saves his 4 marked with triangles in
atari, and makes F15 a threat.  Later stuff around R8 is more severe too.
So total value is a bit under 40 points I think.

If black gets to capture the lower left, that's worth about 34 points.
So, it's a close call which is better, until you realize that it still
takes another move for you to finish off the lower left (at a), plus even
if white defends the lower left you capture the 3 stones ..
white gains 10 or more points on this exchange, I
think.];W[lk]C[owl: Now I thought: 'Oh Gosh! I goofed.
Gotta resign.' But then I saw that W was losing a big group too. But which
one was bigger?   This is very difficult for me to find out because I lost
not only my group but also W has some new opportunities to reduce my upper
left.

Answer: black lost more than white.  Indeed, the upper left 5 points or so
makes a difference.  Plus the fact that black needs to move again to
capture the lower left, so white has sente
now.];B[ej];W[fe];B[fd];W[ee];B[de];W[ff]C[White gets gote so this wasn't big enough to play right
away.];B[im]C[Is this big enough to play?  Atari at T15 looks tempting.
This move is only about 5 or 6 points in gote,
right?];W[sh];B[sj];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[rb]C[owl: is this move necessary?

Answer: I think so, and so playing T15 yourself is bigger than the capture
you made.];W[ma]C[owl: This is now all endgame. I tried as much as I could
to find always the biggest move. But I'm sure I missed a lot. :)]
;B[pb];W[ga];B[fa];W[ia];B[fb];W[qo];B[ro];W[ae];B[ad];W[af]
;B[ed]C[This looks
natural but after seeing that white's next move works, I guess it was an
overplay.];W[bc];B[cc]C[Why can't you just connect?  (Is there something I'm
missing?  See variation from the previous
move)];W[bd];B[bb];W[ac];B[ab];W[ad];B[oo];W[pq];B[op];W[nq]

C[
your whole opening was played on the 3rd line.
You got lots of territory that way but white
had all the outside.  Plus, being low,
you had no base to invade from.  So
naturally black had trouble reducing
white's moyos later (both on the lower
side and in the upper right).

Once you get ahead in territory by playing
low moves on the 3rd line, you need to
get balance by playing out into the
center somewhere.  Taking even more
territory just leads to trouble later
when the fighting starts.])
