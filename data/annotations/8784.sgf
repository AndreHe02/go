Hi David :)];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fc];W[kc]LB[pd:a]C[this pseudo pincer has surprised me. What's the best response ? San-san ?

This would make more sense if A was white.]
(;B[cf]C[I don't know if I can call this bad - you can probably make a good result out of this. I wouldn't do it because it's choosing to attack in a situation where the surroundings don't seem to be ideal to take advantage of the shape you'll get by attacking. From here though, you should be thinking about making a shape that you can use to attack L17 (although it is far).]

You played a lot of reasonable moves. Overall this was a "reasonable" game. No big fights or lost groups. You lost by losing territory at the edges where you didn't need to.

I'd suggest studying a bit of endgame. It starts earlier than you think, and attaching proper importance to sente and gote is emphasized. I think this is an area where you can improve a lot.

To summarize what I think are the biggest areas for potential improvement:
1. Focus on sente. Learn to recognize it and prioritize sente moves. If a 5 point move is sente, think of it as being 10 points, so a sente 5 point move is bigger than a gote 7 point move.
2. Early on, if you can split your opponent, do so (but don't let your position get weak in the process). In general you can be a bit more pushy - if you use sente moves without overextending you can let your oppenent get away with less and take more.
3. Think of moves that serve two purposes. Don't think of a move as serving just one group necessarily. If it can help connect two groups, or strengthen one group and expand a moyo, or strengthen one group and attack your opponent, these moves are efficient and should be pursued.

It's been a pleasure reviewing your game. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.]
