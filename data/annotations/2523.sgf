C[Hello! I would like toask for some ideas mainly about the opening
part of this game. As well if you feel where exactly was the point,
when I lost this game. Any brief comments are welcome... vlkplk

Hello vlkplk! My name is Thomas and would not only like to comment on where you might have lost this game, but on black and white moves & concepts in general. To assign a single move or sequence as the losing one is usualy not the full picture, we all play a mix of weak, good and excellent moves. However, sometimes it might be, that we play the proper tactical sequence for a   less than good purpose - or inversely have the correct game evaluation and a good next aim in mind, but tactics are not adequate. Hence, I'll see what I can find to comment on.

BTW, that's my first game comentary on GTL. I hope that I can make proper variations etc. in the SGF-editor. Please have mercy.

I used SmartGoPlayer in [FF4}, so there shouldn't be many problems on my side. Just be aware that I added diagrams, I hope you can open them and see the sequences.

Overview over my main message for the game is:
Avoid your moves like 44, 52, 66 and 104 where you are just inconsistent and make your own life difficult. It seems you like to fight. Some of your moves are nice shape moves. Hold back some cuts, escapes etc. and protect your groups. "urgent points first" - do you remember that?

You will get then the chances to fully exploit you partners weaknesses (if s/he does not play the same style). Then your fighting power can come into play.
On the other hand - if you're burdend by old bad debts, weak groups, unprotected cuts, you cannot make it to richdom (points).

I wish you good luck!

(;W[kc]C[6: Once the Joseki after the san-san invasion has been completed, 6 might seem too narrow and (too) low *perhaps that is a matter of taste). However has white thaught about what to do with the wall white 8-16 afterwards - how to utilize it, especially that this joseki results in gote W16 AND that the left black 3-4 point is positioned like it is?]

;B[nq];W[qm]C[I am not so good in fuseki, hence I cannot say something with authority on W18. I only try to do several times an evaluation during a game or simply try to envisage future developments after a move.

With 18 I would not know so much what to do. That might be just a matter of taste/style, rather than saying good or bad.

After W16, white is stronger on the upper side (i.e. not weak) and could attack at R12 without fearing to weaken her position. White even played this way in the game. Is then W18 positioned in a good way? I do not know the answer, but this are thoughts which keep me busy before I play a move 18.]

(;W[cf]C[White could also think of playing for the right side with the nadare joseki.]
;B[cd];W[df];B[fc]C[Black 27 is on the 3rd line (stable) and diminuishes the possible future use of whites right wall. I wouldn't like this development for white.]
;W[ck]C[White 28 does not follow the basic rule of thumb n+1 (with n = stones on and above the 3rd line), hence white overextended, will get problems later due to invasion-aji. She must bear later either the invasion or patch up and lose a move, if that move does not bring any extra benefit.]
;B[cm]C[Good for threatening or preparation of invasion.];W[dq]
C[White does not patch up the overextended extension and choses to create a new group.]

(;B[eq];W[cp]C[White tries to gauge-out the corner. Globall that's bad, I think because it creates a black wall for the right and additionally weakens white position at the top left.

There is a hane-Joseki starting with W32 at E2.

However, beside that, have you considered atari-ing here?]

This will cause problems.]
(;W[cn]LB[dn:A][em:B]C[38 is not fully exploiting black's mistake. As white I would like to wedge in at A and create a new cutting point at B.]
;B[dn];W[br];B[ci];W[ej]
(;B[bk]LB[ei:A]C[I would move out and attach at A.];W[bm]C[Is white fearing for the corner? It is difficult to comment on these moves, but it still does not look good for white.]
;B[bl];W[bn];B[cj]C[Splendid result for Black. This is better than a normal invasion could have been. The white stones on the left are made useless and victims. Here starts the loss.]
;W[dk]C[1st: Heavy, 2nd: what is the aim, a) technically speaking, b) globally speaking.
Seems to me like a tenuki. White needs two moves to cut and create an empty triangle.]
;B[ei]C[Normal, enough.]
(;W[hc]C[Giving up the 3 joseki stones CD14 is almost necessary, the game is now very difficult for white.

But white could have tried to sacrifice them in another way.]
;B[gd]C[Good move by black. He could also attach at H16.
Usually this would then be called 'leaning attack', but here these moves are actually capturing the 3 white stones. It is much too costly - in a positional sense to try to escape - even, if white were to succeed at all.]
;W[gf]C[This move is wrong and black proves it in a simple, yet efficient way. please notice, that 51 is the same point which I proposed for white 50.

In Go it is very important to remain flexible and change plans - if the situation has changed.

However, here the situation after black 51 is the same as before white 50, only worsened: the white group is so weak that white should not safe, but rather sacrifice it - and fast!]
;B[hd];W[ic];B[hf];W[gg];B[gi];W[hh]C[Black 55 and 57 were nice and simple - but black has a very easy task here, whereas white is struggling. Do you sense that the black lower moyo will materialize into real territory the harder white struggles with 52..58?

That there might be better tactical moves than the 'amateurs kosumi 58' (e.g. H11 or H13; one has to calculate, I won't do this here) is not important. It is the direction which counts.]
;B[fj]C[Black plays very safe.];W[hj]C[OK, the only reason for this move is that white is so much behind, that she could play everything (otherwise I would still forget about the 52-58 group and try to reduce the moyo; resting the problem where to get some territory for white).

In effect, white is creating another (weak) group here, if black cuts through (he just defended cuts at/with 59).]

(;B[gk]C[Black should cut through (see diagr.).

This move is very re-luctant, re-tracting, submissive, subnormal (re/re-sub/sub).]
;W[qh]C[Right, once black played submissive on the left, you can leave the spot. 62 is at the right tactical spot. White does not have time for further (nice) shape moves on the left.]
;B[pg]
(;W[qe]C[Aji Keshi.
If you learn to hold back these type of moves
your Go will have made progress.];B[re]
(;W[og]C[66 is the same type of wrong principle as the moves 52 and 44.
You change the plan, despite that there is no external reason to do so.
This is not flexibility, but rather sheer inconsequence.
Is there some moyo to build on the left?
(which possibly could justify destroying white's right side prospects withe the 66/67 combination) - No!
Is there a weak white group on the left, whose aji Black could exploit to destroy any - however small - moyo in the K-P-11-16 area? Yes!
Hence, white 66 is destroying own territory prospect for nothing!]
;B[ph]C[67: Black has no choice - and likes it.
66 was a 'Thank you'-move];W[oh]C[68: same commentary as for 66.]

;B[qg];W[rh]C[There is no time for endgame moves like 78!
Do s.th. about the white group on the left!];B[hi]C[Black's moves are very simple and straightforward:
weakening the white group and enlarging the black moyo below.]
;W[ii]C[White creates cutting points for herself. Why?]
(;B[ij];W[ji]C[White can be lucky about 81.
83 is enough, but what if bBlack had cut at W244 (J12)?]
(;B[jj];W[if]C[Nice shape!];B[ie];W[ge]C[This move annd its continuation does not protect the cut at J12 properly.
White will play on with a burden, which black failed to utilize.]
;B[he];W[kj]C[White is playing with a hot needle here.
OK, in first instance the ladder threat is at least working]

(;B[kk]C[I think the cut at L11 is more active, despite that Black is much more to chose his moves than white.]
;W[hk]C[White most probably realizes the moyo and wants to create confusion. OK, but the cut at J12 is unprotected and the two white stones (90) are doomed. If there was an aji, it would be better to connect at J12 first (because it was white's aim since many moves to move out these stones) and keeep the aji of 90 (if there was one).]
;B[jk];W[ki]
(;B[lk]C[Good enough.];W[ko]C[The gane is difficult to comment from hereon.
Strategically you are right - you are playing a handicap game since many moves already and it's about reducing large spheres of influence. You do not have time to take care of every group.

Unfortunately the white groups 52ff have not great shape here and can be cut (J12) and your playing partner is of equal strength.

Hence the eventual outca=ome can be envisaged.];B[no]C[Black played simple and very effective moves.]
;W[jq]C[Contact play is necessary for seeking life in an overwhelming influence.]
;B[jr]C[Black should not help with 97, but simply descend (general principle).]
;W[nm]LB[kr:A]C[Usual continuation of 96-97 would be a cut at A.
Of course it should work then (ladders etc.; not here, Black is too strong).]
;B[mn]C[Black plays very simple and connects safely all the stones.]
;W[ir];B[kr];W[ln];B[mm];W[ml]C[104 is IMHO the same wrong concept as white 52 and 66 earlier.
If the white group dies inside black's moyo - ask yourself - what will then be the advantage or added value of white 104?
Nothing! I presume.
Every move should be multifunctional and serve several positive purposes and goals for yourself - if possible.
I think I couldn't live here - you did,
but W104 did not make life easier black 105 could be a killing move!
Think about why you play moves like 104 ( I don't know), then de-learn it (avoid) and become stronger (by exactly so many stones as the stones you kill yourself by moves like 104).]

If White could then play the undefendable peep at S15, link up in the way shown before, then Black would technically die in the corner.
Even if Black had played then the triangled black stone S16, the corner is dead after this or other variations.
Although this is only a slight chance at all at move 63/64, it is a crime to throw this small chance away. Aji tends to wait and the tension can build up.
