C[Thank you so much for reviewing my game.  I'm interested in any feedback you can give me as to how I can get better, and how I could have done better in this game.  My postgame comments will be prefaced with [mk\].  Thanks again.  I am White in this game, playing with no komi.

Jewdan: You're welcome ^_^ I'll do my best to help you out. My comments will be prefaced by a tilde ("~").]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp]C[[mk\] Is taking the 4-4 points normal enough for white?

~ It should be. This a game without handicap, so White should be strong enough to play a fighting game against Black and triumph. That's the purpose of the hoshi, and it also eliminates the need for White to play supporting developmental moves in the corner.]
;B[oc];W[qj]LB[nq:A]C[[mk\] I wasn't sure exactly what to do here, so I was playing where I thought he would want to play.

~ This is fine, though I believe a lot of professional players prefer to play O3 (marked) in this situation. This move is fairly passive in regards to the opening, whereas the keima kakari at O3 will help White to develop a position. I guess that's what the pros are thinking, anyway.]
;B[ql]CR[id]MA[dj]LB[fc:A][fq:B]C[~ This is a mistake. Black is ahead territorially with one corner to none, but White stands to make the massively influential sanrensei formation by playing D10 (crossed). Black should play to reduce its effectiveness now at either F17 (A) or F3 (B). I prefer F17, as it is already backed by the shimari in the upper right-hand corner, so the F17 stone can be simply settled with an oogeima jump to J16 (circled).

This is also a mistake locally. It defies the proverb "Be first to play in front of a shimari." To approach the R10 stone, Black should play in front of the shimari at R12 (squared), making the most of his shimari in this situation.

How does this affect White's play? It makes White's obvious (and necessary) next move a lot more tasteful.]
;W[qg]C[~ See? Now White has played first in front of the shimari while settling a stone. Not a bad move at all.]
;B[jd];W[dj]TR[qg][qj]LB[nq:A][ok:B]C[[mk\] How's this?

~ I think that it's fine in theory, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

The reason is the triangled group of stones. They're starting to get swallowed up by Black. If Black starts attacking from the outside (fourth line and above), he can force White to settle for a small amount of territory on the side while making a lot of influence in the center.

But Black need not be in any hurry to do that. Since Black has already extended to K16 along the top of the board, he can mimic that with K4 along the bottom, and the influential power of the sanrensei is all but compromised. Plus, it gives him a second method of attack against the two White stones: he can  attempt to attack underneath the stones and force them out into the middle of the board, and follow its flight with one point jumps along the 8 line while making a great moyo.

In this situation, I would rather play O3 or foil Black's attempts in the center with a move like P9 (both marked).]
;B[jq]C[~ I would have played one line higher, but the effect is fairly similar.]
;W[gc]C[[mk\] I was really unsure about this move.  I just figured it was the best move I could think of on the sides.

~ I think it is good to prevent the clean keima kakari at F17. This is a modest move that also enables sliding into the top of the board or an invasion around M17.]
;B[df];W[ce];B[ci];W[cj];B[bi];W[bj]LB[eh:A][di:B]C[[mk\] Seems early to be playing on the second line, but I didn't want to risk not responding.

~When it comes to settling a group, nothing is too early. That's why it's not so bad for Black to descend. However, it's not so good for you to follow, since you don't stand to lose to much here. This move does enable some attacking where Black wants to make eye space, so I won't fault it too much. I just think a move like E12 or D11 (both marked) makes better use of the original intent of the sanrensei formation (to make influence in the center).]
;B[cf];W[bf];B[bg];W[be]LB[ip:A]C[~ This move is small and not even necessary. By playing at B14, you have successfully made a san-san invasion at C17 impossible, even if Black plays B15 first.

I like the idea of playing J4 here (marked) to make use of your wall of three stones in the middle left side.]
;B[fq]C[~ J4 would have made this less painful.];W[dn]LB[fo:A]
C[[mk\] This move seems slow looking at it now.  Would something else have been more efficient?

~ Hmm... I'm not sure "slow" is the word. This violates the proverb "Don't play near thickness." You're extending toward your strong wall, reducing its effectiveness.

If I may point something out, it was the mentality behind this move that made White lose. White is meekly pursuing territory when he's rapidly losing ground in that race, when he could easily go for influence, dominate the center, and use that strength to upend Black's territory.

With that said, you may understand why I say F5 is a better move. It stays away from the wall, makes a moyo, and caps the stone at F5. The worst Black can do is take the san-san at C3, but that just gives you solid territory on the left side.]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[[mk\] I thought it was best to try to split these stones, rather than playing the other 3-4 point, which seemed too passive to me.

~ Passivity is not the problem here; heaviness is. Playing at C4 makes a two-stone wall which is one point away from a single stone which is already too close to a three-stone wall. D3 is probably the best move, to try to start a fight and get some influence in the center by attacking Black's stones along the bottom. Unfortunately, you didn't use it like that.

See the variation on White's next move to see what I have in mind.]
;B[dr]
(;W[cp]C[~ Unlike the variations, this changes nothing.];B[bq]
;W[bp]C[[mk\] Same question as last time I played on the second line at B10.

~ This was your last chance to play E2.];B[eq];W[fo]LB[go:A]
C[[mk\] This seemed like a good move to expand into the center opposite the wall I have on B-D10.  Is it too slow?

~It's another cramped move. I think you should make the giraffe's neck at G4 instead (marked).]
;B[nq]C[~ Ouch. Black plays the best invasion point the lower-right corner that White had (if White could develop strength to support the invasion, that is).

Let's look at the board for a moment. White's initial moves indicated a game based on influence, since he played his first two moves were on the hoshi. With those two hoshi, he has instead taken territory. His stones are separated into three separate groups which are essentially incapable of interacting, thus leaving him with practically no influence.

Black decided to try for territory and influence (the komoku and hoshi opener), has easily gottern territory, and can quickly gain influence.

Estimating the scores at this point, let's estimate the score:
Black: 14 moku (lower-left corner and bottom) + 15 moku (lower-right corner) + 12 moku (upper-right corner) = 41 moku
White: 17 moku (upper-left corner) + 14 moku (lower-left side) = 31 moku

White's approximately 10 moku behind and has little influence... things don't look good. Is there anything that can be done?

The answer is, "Yes." Black has one weakness. Try to find it before looking at the variation on White's next move.]

(;W[qn]TR[qg][qj]C[[mk\] It seemed to me that an invasion of some sort was needed here, but to be honest, I have no idea how to do it.

~ Don't try to invade until you're ahead in influence (meaning you have strength to back up an attack). This invasion would work if you had more strength in the area. Also, this invasion risks the two marked stones if Black decides to make you run.]
;B[pn];W[rl];B[qm]
(;W[rm];B[rn];W[qo];B[ro];W[qk];B[qp];W[pl];B[pm];W[ol]C[~ This sequence has actually increased Black's territory beyond my initial estimation. Essentially, you've helped Black.]
;B[hc];W[gd];B[gf]C[~ Black's weak group is pretty much okay now. White has already lost.

Since I don't like it when reviewers say, "No more comments," when there's a lot of game left to review, I'm not going to do that to you. There's a lot more that can be learned than just how you could have won.]
;W[fi];B[fh];W[gh];B[fg];W[hh];B[ho];W[gp]LB[nn:A]C[[mk\] To me, the F3 to H5 gap seemed like I needed to try to cut it, but would I have been better doing something around G7?

~ G7 feels too shallow. I think the local move is the attatchment at H6. But that's not the real problem... the problem is Black's ballooning moyo. I think O6 (marked) is an excellent move to reduce it.]
;B[hq];W[gm]C[[mk\] In the end I got to play there anyway.

~ It's still too shallow :P];B[hm];W[hl];B[hn];W[il];B[jh]C[~ Black is far ahead... there's no need to try to fight. He can play easily to still win.]
;W[ng];B[ne]LB[if:A]C[~ I think J14 is a much wiser move for Black.]
;W[ig];B[jf]
(;W[lh]C[~ Since Black failed to connect against your peep, why didn't you cut? See variation.]

;B[jm];W[jl]MA[hb][aq][ei][jb]C[~ This move is unnecessary. It saves maybe a single moku. You should aim for larger endgame moves instead. I've marked some ideas.]
;B[ki];W[li];B[ih];W[hi];B[hg];W[he];B[if];W[hb];B[ic];W[ib]
;B[jb];W[gb]C[[mk\] Did I need to connect here?

~ No.];B[fe];W[fd];B[ee];W[ed]C[~ You didn't need to connect here, either.]
;B[de];W[cd]C[[mk\] Overly conservative?

~ Worse. He played a dame point, or a point that doesn't change the score at all, and you responded as though it were sente. On top of that, you made the empty triangle shape around B16. E12 is a far better move here.]
;B[ei];W[ej];B[fj];W[gi];B[lj];W[kj];B[mj];W[mi]C[~ This is the beginning of your problems in this area. A simple connection at N12 would have been the end of this (unless he peeped at O11).]
;B[ni];W[mh];B[mk];W[nk]C[~ Simply connect at O8, and your problems are solved.]
;B[nj];W[oj];B[nm]C[[mk\] Obviously at this point my small group at O6 is lost - I'm sure I bungled that somehow, but I was afraid of losing even more above.]

(;W[ap];B[bs];W[ie];B[je];W[sn]MA[di][ah]C[[mk\] Obviously I bungled this upcoming exchange.  I suppose I should have done other things first, then connect at S9 later when I have to?

~ Yeah, but there's not really much left on the board. The only two other moves I see are marked with crosses.]

My advice to you is to buy a copy of _In the Beginning_ from Kiseido's Elementary Go Series. Read that book carefully, and then reread it every time you fall into a slump. This has helped me get to where I am now, and I'm sure it can help you, too.]

Note, however, that though this move gives you the corner (taking away a lot of Black's points), he ends up with a large wall facing the center of the board with every variation. Since he's ahead in territory, he can afford to make this exchange.

If this weren't bad enough, all of these sequences end with his sente. It's too early to make an invasion here.]
