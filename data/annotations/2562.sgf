C[This is the first game I've played in a while where neither player made any gross errors (okay, I admit it - usually it's me) and I'd be interested to see what a more skilled player has to say about it.  Are the opening moves in the game solid?  In many games recently I feel like I open strongly but fall back a lot in the middle game, and I have difficulty invading or reducing my opponent's territory.  My opponent in this game wasn't that aggressive...where should I have been expecting attacks?

[Migeru\] I review games for Kimberly on KGS sometimes, so I'll review this for both sides.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dp]C[[Migeru\] Playing in opposite corners leads to a fighting game. Nothing wrong with that, but if you don't like fighting you should play differently. It seemed to work well for you in this game.]
;W[dd];B[nq];W[qm]LB[qn:1][jq:3][qq:2]C[[Migeru\] This extension is possible, although 1 is more common. Black should consider an immediate san-san invasion at 2. 3 is also played.]

(;B[kp];W[fq];B[hq]C[This seemed an ideal opportunity to take territory and pincer the white stone simultaneously.

[Migeru\] I agree.]
(;W[dq]CR[cq]C[[Migeru\] White usually plays san-san in this situation instead.]
;B[cq];W[cr]
(;B[cp];W[eq];B[dj]LB[fo:1]CR[dl]C[Should I have extended further? I was expecting white d7 or similar after this.

[Migeru\] No, not any further. A 3-point extension is ideal form 2 stones. Also, I would probably have played at 1 before extending.]
;W[ch]CR[df]C[[Migeru\] This extension allows an invasion later in the game.]
;B[bj]CR[dm]C[[Migeru\] This is a possible reduction move for white.]
;W[jd]CR[dd][pd]C[[Migeru\] it is better to approach black's corner than to extend this far from your own corner.]
;B[qj]CR[pg]C[[Migeru\] This invites an invasion by white.]
;W[pk];B[pj];W[fo];B[en];W[eo];B[do];W[fn];B[em]CR[gl]C[[Migeru\] The knight's move is more aggressive for white.]
;W[fm];B[el];W[eh]CR[ok]C[[Migeru\] too slow. And the marked point is more urgent.]

;W[om];B[ml];W[nc];B[pb];W[jh]SQ[ec][ne][pr]CR[cc][lc][qq]C[[Migeru\] Both black has two san-san invasions that are more profitable that playing in the center. There is also an invasion at M17.]
;B[ne]CR[cc][lc][qq];W[jk]SQ[ec][ld][pr]CR[cc][lc][qq]C[[Migeru\] there are no points in the center.]

[Migeru\] I agree that this strengthens white unnecessarily, but I don't think L17 is good.]
