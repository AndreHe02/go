Thanks in advance for the review!

I wasnt happy with my play in this game, i'm especially interested in the opening, although maybe i was weaker in middle game...


Thanks :)

EmTom:
Hi there!

I had a pleasure to comment this game for you. To be honest it was a difficult task. Fuseki was pretty straightforward. In the middle game however the game became totally insane. You were fighting all over the board and both of you missed some oportunities. Im sure I also missed some oportunities.

So in my opinion it is most useful to analyse fuseki of this game and focus on a following question: "Why did this game turned into such a struggle?". Answering this question and adjusting your game to prevent such violence will pay you back for sure.]

Maybe a pincer high pincer would work, works well with my hoshi stone?

EmTom:
This stone formation at the bottom is a Kobayashi fuseki (perhaps you already know that). It's idea is that it is easy for black to answer white kakari. Especially when it is played as close to the corner as in this game. As there are many more competent sources on the net, I won't show you variations here. Instead I suggest this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIeWNVuzebU]
;B[np];W[pj]LB[qf:A]C[EmTom:
This white extension is quite far from Q5. I think it would be best for you to harras it a bit at once. Otherwise if W plays at A first her position will be much more stable and you will lose your chance.]
(;B[fc];W[jc]LB[qh:A][lc:B]C[my hoshi stone looks so sad here

could i have played k17 instead of kakari as w has q10 already?

EmTom:
As I mentioned earlier it would probably be better to play A before kakari. I would still suggest playing it now. Your corner stone is in a perfect position to support moves like A or B so I wouldn't say it looks bad.]

LB[qh:A][hc:B]C[EmTom:
There are more urgent moves to make here. I would consider C14 light now and play tenuki. It is not easy for white to get a lot of territory on the left side right now. 

A is urgent as it attacks white gaining obvious profits on the right side

B is urgent as it strenghtens your group and puts a lot of pressure on whites marked stone.]

Again A or B seems better.];W[hq]
(;B[dr]LB[fp:A]C[EmTom:
This is unusual. I think you were worried about your stone but you should think about attacking white.

I think now white has one interesing move at A to try to connect.]

You are forcing white to cut your stones.];W[hp];B[fo];W[hn]

(;B[gr]C[EmTom:
A big mistake. This move does only force white to make an eye.]
;W[gq];B[eq];W[hr];B[hd]C[EmTom:
You abandon the fight in the middle and I think it is urgent to play there. Once again you miss an oportunity to gain an advantage.]
;W[id];B[hb];W[nc];B[qh]LB[lp:A]C[EmTom:
This game is getting crazy... Too many tenukis. I'm not sure at all whether it is a good move right now or not. The problem is that now you fight all over the board so black kind of missed his chances for a lead from fuseki. 

A is coming and is severe now as H4 group got stronger. Top right corner is also not strong at all... White also has weaknesses all over the board with many attacks possible so at this point this game is just insane.]

Summary:
This game is completely crazy. Fighting all over the board. If I were to give you one advice (and I think it is correct to focus on just one thing at a time when you want to improve) I would suggest you to try to make solid groups and attack only from your strength.]

White is weak on the right side. This move adds a threat to separate white so she will have to respond. My idea here would be to gain a bit in sente on the right side and then switch to kakari you played in the game.]
