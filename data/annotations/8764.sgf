C[Dear reviewer,

I play as white in this game and I may be around 1k KGS too. Please review for both sides as I'll surely discuss the review with my opponent.

I see chinese fuseki is played a lot nowadays though I'm not found of this opening, maybe I should study it much. I may have wrong but I don't see big mistakes in fuseki I think I lost this game by not earning enough profit during the middle game fight.

Thanks for your time.

(;B[ok]LB[nh:1][oi:2]C[Playing the one space jump instead feels like a better way to strenghten the group.]
(;W[nh]LB[og:B][oi:A]C[I believe this is the first mistake. White's shape is thin and strange. Black has all sort of weak points to aim for. Moves like A or B may be troublesome later. Compare this to white playing first at A, and I think it is clear that this would be a better alternative.]
;B[jp];W[po];B[np];W[no];B[mo]LB[nn:1][qq:2]TR[ok]C[White could also play the attachment in the corner to make sabaki. Because of the marked black stone, running away becomes more difficult for white.]
(;W[nn]LB[op:A]C[I think black's next move should be to protect his weakness at A. He should keep white weak and attackable.]
;B[mk]LB[mm:1][op:3][qq:2]C[To play the attachment now would just help black,
Black neglected to protect his weakness, so white should take advantage of it now.

\\m/ : my opponent suggested r3 now after the game]
(;W[mm];B[mp]LB[oo:B][op:A]C[Black is happy to protect the cut. He now has secure points in the corner while white has two weak groups to take care of. The game looks promising for black.
However, I think black should protect with A instead, because this move would also threathen to push and cut at B.]

TR[nj][pj][nk][pk]C[These peeps helps the white group, but it also hurts the other weak group, because black can later cut at A.

\\m/ : during the game, I felt that these peeps help my shape but now I'm no more sure about that and maybe playing 34 directly should have been better.]
;B[ck]LB[lc:4][kf:2][ci:1][co:3]TR[hc][ld][ik]C[It is not easy to find a good move for white in this position. In the following variations I make some suggestions, but I can not say for sure that they are any good.

\\m/ : here, I have the feeling that there's something to do on marked weaknesses but I'm at a loss to find how to gain the most profit from this position]
(;W[ci]LB[db:B][ch:A]C[This extension is probably not very important right now. If black were to play at A, white would be fine taking a big corner with B, which would also help white invading the upper side later.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[dn]
(;W[ld];B[le];W[me]LB[lc:2][md:1]C[Instead of cutting, there is a more fancy connection.]
(;B[md];W[ke];B[lc];W[lf];B[kc]TR[hc][qc]C[Black secures the upper side, though not completely, as there is still aji around the marked spots. Since white got to make a ponnuki in sente, which threathens the stability of blacks centre group, I think the result is fine for white.]
;W[db];B[fe];W[jh]C[This move looks dubious.white is safe already, and the upper side is not interesting. This move only aims to attack the black group, but to attack for the sake of attacking is a good idea only when you can kill something.]
;B[ik]
(;W[ej]LB[ri:1][jm:2][lm:3]C[Now is time for black to cut. There are two ways, but it looks like both may work.]
(;B[ri];W[rh];B[rj];W[rf];B[ro]TR[jm][lm]C[Black is hurting his own corners, so one naturally wonders if there is no other way to secure his group. Black can still take advantage of the marked weakness.]

[mm:24][ro:57][op:A]C[This game was good for black from the start. White's first mistake was playing the strange ogeima at move 16. This created a weak shape which black could take advantage of.
The second big mistake for white was in playing 24 instead of A, a move that black should have played first himself. I also think that 36 looks like a vague move that is not so good, but it is also true that finding a good alternative is not so easy.

For black I think the most important mistake was playing the weak moves of 53 and 57. These painful moves lost a lot of points, the game becamse closer than it should (and with stronger yose, it is not impossible that white would win). Black should have cut at 12 or B instead.

(;W[qn];B[rn];W[pn]LB[qn:A]C[White takes gote and it is not clear what white has gained from the push. I also do not see why black would now chose to take gote to play the hane next. Black should just tenuki now.]
