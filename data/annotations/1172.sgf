C[Dear reviewer:

I played black. I don't know my strength but I played with a jago program computer, this program is 17k on NNGS and sometimes I win and sometimes I loose. Then I think my strength is about 18k.

In this game I did mistakes innocents, but I will like your comments about some aspects of my play (openning, invasions, defense,...)

Thanks for your time.

;W[dp];B[od];W[qj];B[qm]C[Good sense of attach: it is right to push your enemy against your powerful position making a framework.
However, this move is better played at R8, because it is a more severe way to attack and because it enlarges your framework.
After BR8, of course, W6 doesn't work, because B can play O4 (making territory while attacking), without mind to sacrifice the stona on R8; another way to play BR8, WR6, BQ6, trying to kill.]
;W[qg];B[fc]C[Great: this is the right direction, working well whit your shimari.]
;W[cf];B[ch]C[I think this is your first mistake.
W' s shimari is very strong.
Now you have two separated stones which need an extension.
When W will play a move between your two stones, he will attack both your positions.]
;W[db]C[I probably would have played at C10; after that B would have been in trouble.]
;B[ic]C[Good.
The three space jump, beeing a connection, is good.
Perhaps you could have played at K16, because of your shimari.
It is a little weaker, but you can afford to loose F17 in the future in exchange with territory on the upper right corner.]
;W[nq];B[lp]C[This move is very good in a local contest, but is more important to help your weak stone at C12.
Remember: who has a weak group in the fuseki will loose.];W[qq]
C[It is a little difficult to say what' s the rule to chgoose the direction in response on the invasion...]
;B[qp]C[But this is the wrong one.
You had the corner and you have played two more stones than W here.
After that variation W will gain abouit 15 points in the corner and you will obtain only a wall which is not very useful because of W extended position on the right side.
After BQ3, WQ2, BP2, WR2, BP3, WR4, BR5, WS6, BS7, you will have a great position.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[lr];B[np]C[Not good: BP3   WP2   BO2   WN2   BQ2   WO1   BR2  WS3  BS2  and you will take the corner.
Other W' s moves let you take the left side.
Please verify that. (and tell me if you have problems).];W[oq]
;B[cn]C[Great :-))
You are approaching a corner from your stone, reinforcing it and pushing W to your strong position.]
;W[fq];B[dk]C[Very good. :-))
C9 (as you probably now playing that move) would have made a double three space jump, which is cuttable.]
;W[bp]C[Little move.];B[me]C[The main part of the fuseki is over.
W is ahead in territory, but you have no weak groups, so, to even the game, you have to attack and chase your opponent' s weak groups.
A move like that is not very severe, so you need something more to take the initiative in the second part of the fuseki.
P13 or a move around P9 would have mantain sente making territory or frameworks.
Another way to play (maybe too much aggressive) is F14: now W' s corner group is closed; it probably will live, but only with a perfect play, because you have many forcing moves inside the group.
After a move like that, your opponent would have probably played a move near the corner, fearing the kill, and your move at F14 would have worked well with your walls and would have prepeared moves of attacking the right group.]
;W[iq]C[This is little: better to defend the the weaker group.]
;B[jp]C[Good sense: this move works well with your moyos, but you let your opponent defend his group.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[eg]C[W "escapes" (even if the corner is strong) threatening something against your left group.]
;B[eh];W[fh];B[ei];W[fi];B[fj];W[gj];B[fk];W[gg]C[:-((
You have made points reinforcing your group, but now W has an influence which destroys much of the power of your high position on a large scale.]
;B[if];W[rl];B[ql]C[Good: S3 would have only made few points.]
;W[rm];B[qk];W[rk];B[pj]C[Good: you are trying to make a central territory.
Remember: a framework is called territory is it is closed at at least three sides.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[rj];B[ph]C[This is not the good direction to realise your good idea:
BP11  WQ12   B P9 and you make a semi-territory of many points and the agj of your sacrificed stone is not totally finished.]
;W[oi];B[oj];W[oh];B[pg];W[qh];B[mj]C[:-))
You make points, but your opponents group will disturb you, being R11 dead.]
;W[qf];B[og]C[I think you can sacrifice that two little stones.
K10 or F6 are better.];W[ng];B[of]C[The form made by P14, P13 and Q13 is called "empty triangle" and it is a bad shape.
You have to avoid tha kind of shape.
If you are forced to play that shape, it means that you missed something before.]

C[Good sequence :-))
I didn' t belive that you could have capture the two W stones, but you are absolutly right: in the future I will look at your moves with more attention not to correct many analisys ;-)]
;W[qn];B[ol]C[I don' t see the reason of this move.
At a first sight it seems to be impossible for W to create problems inside your group. (of course, maybe I' m wrong).
Allowing W to enter inside your group means to loose all its point and, probably, to loose the game.]
;W[pn]C[This move is a fatal blow: now you have real points only in the upper side and on the left.]
;B[nn]C[:-)
Very good.
This move connects.
Now you have to use your moyo' s power to complicate the game.]
;W[lj];B[gk];W[bg];B[bh];W[ga]C[In Italy we call that move "the monkey jump": it is a great endgame move (about 15 points in sente), but now you don' t have to be threatened about that, becauyse you have onlly to work for the chuban.,]
;B[fb]C[Let your opponent to steal you something here (it' s about 8 points more than the first monkey jumo).
You could have used this sente to play at M9 or trying some complications in a corner.]
;W[ip];B[jo];W[ll]C[Now the game is really over: you have no points here.
You can only hope for a big mistake.];B[jl];W[mk];B[nk];W[pk]
;B[pl];W[nl]C[Both you and me know you miss something hedre, but this is not important: you will learn that kind of tricks after some games with experience: now it is not useful to loose time to see this tesuji.
>From here to the end you played some moves which lost one point in gote (which means that sometimes you could have not defend inside your own territory), but it doesn' t matter for now.
The main things I have to say end now.
The endgame is less interesting.
I hope you enjoed my comments.
If you didn' t understand something (words or concepts), or if I wrote some unresoneable things, please tell me.
I think that I told you very much, probably too much.
Please don' t loose too much time to see my comments: it is important you understand a pair of concepts, then play a pair of games, and only then re-read the analisy.
I think you have a style of playing better than the rank you told me; the computer can defeat you in tactical variations, but I' m sure that with about two more months of experience you will simply destroy his.
Good luck and Bye
