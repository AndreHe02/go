;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[no];B[pk];W[jd]
;B[cf];W[ce]C[This make Black thick on the left side.];B[df];W[fd];B[dj]
;W[nc];B[mp];W[np];B[ip];W[fp];B[hp]L[iq]C[Wrong  direction. Black should play 'A'  the key point now. If White get to play H4  it will give White an overconcentrated shape, so this point is not as urgent  as 'A']
;W[iq]C[Now the Black group floats in the center and is  very heavy,  furthermore it almost  look like white can connect the lower side and get  territory in the process.]
;B[jq];W[jr];B[kr]C[The double hane is strong and saves the game for Black]
;W[kq];B[jp];W[lr];B[kp]L[ir][ks][gq][hr][gr][is][gp][gs]
M[mp]C[This is a bad case of aji keshi. Black seems to be too interested  in the marked stone to the right, which is kikashi and can be discarded  without regret. Instead Black could cut through with sequence Black 'a',  White 'b', ..., upto the connection with Black 'g'. After that White can  connect in a kofight with White 'h'. That kofight would be just profit for  Black, since nothing could be lost in it. One has to be careful before  playing an atari like this if there are other possibiliites.]
;W[ks]L[gp][gq]M[do][no]C[Now 'A' and 'B' are Miai and all the White  stones are connected which mean that White is strong. The Black group is  heavy and the two marked White stones are very strong now, so Black has not  achieved anything in this fight.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[fm]L[dn]C[This is too loose. Perhaps Black should play  once at 'A' and depending on how White answer jump into the center with the  weak group.]
;W[dn];B[dm]L[cm][fo]C[Impossible move. Black has no choice but to  compromise with 'a' that way he at least get secure territory. Black might be  able to force with 'b' so the Black shape is not totally bad if he let white  cut through above 'a'..]
;W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[bp];W[cm]M[dm]C[This is embarrassing for Black -  the  wrongly played Black stone is very inefficiently placed.]
;B[gn];W[ln]M[no]L[dl][ek][mo]C[This is kind of White. Territorially this  area is neutral and the move itself violates a basic principle of go"Do not  play close to thickness", since the marked stone is very strong. Black has  now the chance to play 'a' to fix up the shape, recover slightly from the  prior error and let the stone at D7 do some work and strategically connect  all the weak Black stones. My feeling for this postion is that White should  attack vigorously at B, separating the Black groups and take the initiative  in the center fight. Playing White 'a' would be too kind since Black could  get the more central point of B then (Black could ignore that atari since  that stone would be completely valueless).

The move played is also dangerous since Black can make up for his earlier aji  kechi mistake and use the kikashistone at N4 to cut beginning with C and  Black might even end up with a moyo in the center. At least this is a threat  from now on.]
;B[cc]L[pf][qf][dl]C[I can understand that Black want to do  something dramatic now, but  is not A or B more urgent than playing this  standard invasion? Furthermore I am afraid that the non territorial move at C  is the proper move here.]
;W[cd]C[This is a special move for special occasions,  and to be frank I do  not know how to handle this, therefore  I hope that white does since  otherwise there is a big risk of loosing from a move like this.]
;B[ec]L[db][dl]M[dd][cd][ce]C[I think 'a' might be the proper response  to the white empty triangle. I cheated and looked in Ishidas Joseki  Dictionary and it recommend Black to play elsewhere since the White response  does not have an effect on the outside. Later Black could play 'a' and live  easily. Perhaps Black should play 'b' or play in the upper left.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[eb]L[cb]C[I wonder if this is good, White A look stronger  since it will capture a stone without sacrificing. Giving away a ponnuki in  an invasion attempt does not feel right.]
;B[fb];W[fc]L[ed]C[Now it is Whites turn to play aji keshi. The important  point here is 'A' since Black can cut White if that is not played by White  later.]
;B[ea];W[cb];B[gc];W[hb]L[ek]C[This look too aggressive but it is  justified by the White threat of 'A'. If Black get three weak groups in the  center one is likely to die perhaps.]
;B[bc]L[ed]C[I think this is good. The timing is good since it threaten  to live in the corner so white must answer it and white will have some  troubles with liberties late if Black get to play at 'a'.]
;W[bb];B[ed]C[Black seems to interpret the situation correctly.];W[ee];B
[eb];W[fe];B[hc];W[ic]L[ib][gb]C[Bad shape. White should draw  Back patiently With 'a'. Then Black 'b' would not threaten to capture with  'A'. White loses a tempo here which is very bad.]
;B[gb];W[ib]L[ic]C[Would White play at 'A' now if it was White turn to  play and it was not played yet? Probably not.]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[he];W[fg]L[de][ff]M[df][cf]C[It would probably be more proper to play  'a', since Black can cut in sente. It is difficult for Black to cut at B as  long as the marked stones are not safe.]
;B[if];W[dh];B[bf]L[ch]C[Cutting first and then play  'a' is perhaps better.]
;W[bh]L[de]C[Unreasonable, White should take advantage of the Black  mistake and connect now.]
;B[bd];W[de];B[be]C[A very drastic change of the strategic situation. Black  become strong in the upper left and both players have many weak groups in the  center.

Perhaps the game is even now.];W[dl]L[ek][fi]C[White get the vital point, perhaps 'a' is stronger but now there is  much more uncertainty in that area since there is a weak White group  involved. Perhaps White even should defend with 'b' first.]
;B[kn]L[fj][mo][mn][nn]C[This is very bad.
1) If White answers then Black cannot cut here anymore. A loss without  compensation.
2) White can ignore it and defend the weak group.

Black 'a' look like the vital point too me. That would force White to  struggle to live with the weak group and Black would probably get stronger in  the center and then Black might try to cut and fight with 'b' etc.]
;W[lo];B[kl]C[This move is just played in the middle of nowhere.];W[ko]
L[jn]C[But White get confused as well. Perhaps that was Blacks  plan. If Black play 'a' now the flimsy shape becom much better. This white  move is truly a "thank you"-move.]
;B[jn];W[jo];B[io]L[in]C[Black can also calmly play 'a', which is a  little thicker but it does not matter much.]
;W[qf]C[A good point, but the situation to the left is much more urgent.]
;B[nd];W[oc];B[od];W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[of]L[qi][qh][ne]C[It seems that this  just force White to play at 'a', attacking with a pincer with B would be more  in spirit with the original attachment above and with the whole board  situation. Remember that Black can attack the upper left white group at any  time severly. WHite would just get more problems if he cut at C after black B]
;W[qi];B[oi];W[rk]C[Now Black has to attack on the left.];B[qm]C[Ugh! Unless this move threatens to cleanly *kill* the the right side  group it is a horrible mistake. Any attack on the left should at least be  sente, Black could get back and play here later.]
;W[fi]C[At last... It seems like White get all the strategic points in this  game, and that is probably the main reason for the Black loss.]
;B[fk]C[Now it look like Black has to defend himself!];W[hi];B[ji];W[el]
L[ek]C[White should cut immediately with A or  something. That would take territory and solve the problems in this area at  once.]
;B[fj]C[Good move. White is in trouble.];W[gj];B[gk];W[hk];B[hl];W[gl];B
[fl];W[il];B[hm];W[ij];B[rd]C[Black should continue to harass  White on the left.]
;W[qc];B[pc]L[qd]C[Black should just play 'a' and think "thank you" since  then the the right white group has to defend itself. Then Black can push  through in the corner in the endgame *after* an attack on the left.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qb];W[rc];B[rb];W[pe];B[ob];W[nb];B[le];W[ke]L[kd]
C[White make a reading mistake. Playing 'a'  is the proper move];B[mc];W
[oa];B[pb];W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[kd];W[kc];B[kb]C[This is a minus  move. Black just looses points in sente leaving more profit for White to get.]
;W[ld];B[md];W[jb];B[eh]M[fi]C[Well, one wonder how this move had worked *before*  White played the marked stone...]
;W[ei];B[eg];W[ej];B[dg]C[QUE??? I cannot even imagine what the  purpose behind this move was. Was it intended to force White to connect??]
;W[di]C[That move must have felt really good for White.];B[qr];W[jf];B[gg]
L[gh]C[Black must has been playing in time pressure. Th  vital point here is A threatening two things in the same time, if it does not  work now it should be saved for later.]
;W[hg];B[fh];W[gh];B[ek];W[dk];B[em]C[If this move is not sente then... it  is very bad.]
;W[kh];B[mg]L[ph]C[The last moves Black has played has just lost points. I do not  understand any territorial meaning this move. A move at 'a' would at least  defend in sente and reduce the White territory to minmum.]
;W[kj];B[sc];W[sd];B[sb]L[or][rl]C[It is too small! A and B is  much bigger.]
;W[ig];B[ab]M[if]C[Black should play elsewhere first and sacrifice the  marked stone if he think he has too few liberties.]
;W[im];B[in];W[ph];B[oh];W[mi];B[lp];W[nn];B[rl]C[Good.];W[qk];B[ql];W[pj]
;B[ok];W[ml];B[or]C[Good.];W[oq];B[ps]L[pq]C[??? Could someone please tell whats wrong with  capturing at 'A'?]
;W[nr];B[pq];W[ie]C[Oops.];B[hf];W[gg]C[Gote];B[fo];W[kk];B[sk];W[rj];B
[ch];W[ci];B[cg]L[fr]C[I think Black 'A' is  worth much more, at least  Black should follow up the atari.]

;W[ai];B[kg];W[mh];B[lg];W[jg];B[ar]C[It is a liitle bit late defending here  now... this group is alive without it.]

;W[oo];B[nf];W[tt];B[tt];C[I think Black lost this game because he did not see the strategic  opportunities in the game and sometimes did not see the direction of play.  That is the hardest parts in go but when one see the board as one whole and  how the weaknessesses and strengths of the groups are interrelated then one  has become much musch stronger. This game was not a reading fight it was more  about strategic attack and defense and strategic timing.]
