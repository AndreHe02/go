AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[SKinahan [22k?\]: Hi
PointBar [17k\]: hi

Actually this handicap is much larger than I deserved. 17k is about my true strength. However, I'm having considerable trouble convincing KGS of this :)

[Rich\] - Hi, I'll be reviewing your game. At the end I'll summarise my comments into pointers.

A couple of key points, I'll mark the numbers by each comment where they apply; 

1) if you make contact with your stones, both sides tend to get stronger locally. Keep a bit of distance to attack.

2) Keep your stones connected and your opponent's split. Especially in a handicap game, concentrate on connections. Try playing a few games where you do almost nothing but. :)]
;W[nq]
(;B[oq]TR[jp]C[Under the circumstances, this seemed better than the attachment move.

[Rich\] - (1) This encourages your opponent to get strong. It's ok when you already have a stone around /\, otherwise play away and don't make him fight :) See var.]
;W[pn]
(;B[oo]TR[np]C[The idea here was to retain access to the centre. It doesn't look like any Joseki you'd find in a book, though, does it ?

[Rich\] - (2) Good move, keep his stones apart. now he has two weak groups. Joseki are useful, though... his stone should have been played at /\ (according to joseki this would have been good for him), so you could also play there to keep him separated. See var.]
;W[po];B[qp];W[qf];B[qh];W[nd]
(;B[oc]C[[Rich\] - (2) should keep him separated again... always try to separate his stones and link yours up.]
;W[of];B[qk];W[ol]
(;B[qe]C[[Rich\] - (2) again, here keep his stones apart - this time the stones above and below.]
;W[ph];B[qg];W[pg];B[pi];W[oi];B[pj];W[oj];B[qm];W[pm];B[nn]
C[This isn't looking great. White's wall is bigger than blacks territory. Rigtht ? Hence this move that tries to push towards the middle.

[Rich\] - Black's centre stone is doing a lot to dilute white's wall.  But your basic idea is good; keep access to the centre and don't let him build too much influence.]
;W[fc];B[jc];W[jd];B[hc];W[lc];B[kd];W[id];B[ic];W[kc];B[gd]
;W[ke]C[Sacrificing that stone turns out to have been a good move - the black wall that develops at the top becomes quite influential.

[Rich\] - It's always good to be prepared to sacrifice stones. This was a good exchange for black.]
;B[fd];W[dc];B[cc];W[cb];B[ec];W[db];B[bc];W[hb];B[gb];W[ib]
;B[jb];W[eb];B[ed];W[ga];B[fb];W[fa];B[gc];W[bb]
(;B[ia]C[White just lives at the top left. Was there a play to kill here ? Not that it was necessary.

[Rich\] - You could have killed white; see variation.];W[ac]
;B[ad];W[ab];B[cd];W[ea];B[dj]C[I reckoned this extension was justified, and it does seem to have worked. Possibly a little closer would have been better ?

[Rich\] - Absolutely not! If anything further away; but here is good, I like it. You should try not to play too close to influence, whether yours or your opponent's. Then, if your opponent tries to invade, you can attack him and have all that wall to back you up!]
;W[ca]C[White didn't really need to do that, right ?

[Rich\] - No, he was already alive; if you'd played there, he'd play one space to the left, and vice versa.]
;B[hq]C[So black extends.];W[cn];B[co]TR[dj]C[[Rich\] - this *is* a good time to attach low, with /\ in place]
;W[bo]
(;B[bp]C[[Rich\] - You don't have to kill him, if you can seal him in and get something on the outside...]
;W[bn];B[cl];W[en]
(;B[el]C[[Rich\] - If you're trying to kill him at this point, you need to stop him making eyes... see var.]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[bm];B[gm];W[do];B[cp];W[ep]C[So maybe it was a mistake for black to emphasise the wall towards the middle, instead of defending the corner ? White gains rather a lot here.

[Rich\] - It seems good here; black still has the corner and has made nice influence in the centre, white has almost nothing.]
;B[eq];W[fp]
(;B[go]C[[Rich\] - this should be below.];W[fq];B[er];W[fr]
;B[fs];W[gs]C[So in retrospect, I think this black shape is dead, or maybe a ko ? In this case it worked out OK, as white miscalculates later.

[Rich\] - as far as I can tell, it depends who gets to play C2 first...]
;B[es];W[hr]
(;B[jq]C[[Rich\] - see var..]
(;W[jr]C[[Rich\] - see var..];B[kr];W[iq];B[ip];W[ir];B[kp]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[lr];B[mq];W[ks];B[kq];W[mr];B[nr];W[mp];B[np]
;W[lq]C[So black is having trouble stopping white making a break for the centre. Maybe it was a mistake to respond to the atari here ?

[Rich\] - Well, you can't kill everything on the board :)  walling off the centre is good, white still has very few points.]

(;B[nq];W[lp];B[ko];W[lo];B[ln];W[kn];B[mo];W[jo]C[Ooop !];B[jn]
;W[jp];B[km];W[lm];B[ko];W[kp];B[kn];W[ml];B[ll];W[mm];B[mn]
;W[lk];B[kl];W[io]C[So white's shape on the right looks a bit dodgy. Had I been playing white, I would have emphasised preventing the black corner connecting to the groups in the middle, as the corner looks alive.

[Rich\] - White is way behind on territory, and the corner is connected. He has to pull off a big capture to win.]
;B[in];W[hg];B[he]C[So black was trying to prevent white getting too much in the middle here. Obviously the previous stone was an attempt to get into the space between the two thick-looking black groups. I feel I (black) responded badly, as the following moves all look a bit limited and heavy

[Rich\] - Your move is good in principle, trying to cut the stone off where you're strong. Although you're so far ahead you don't need to fight.]
;W[if];B[ie];W[je];B[hf];W[ig];B[gg];W[gh]
(;B[fh]C[[Rich\] - you could drop back here; white will have to defend against the cut anyway, and you can take a bigger point.]
;W[fg];B[gf]C[So black responds to the cut by falling back to the line between the wall and its extension from earlier. This would have been easier if it had been closer, but then the other group would have been harder to build.

[Rich\] - keeping the line of a space like that is generally a good result for black. You get lots of territory, and white hasn't invaded successfully - which he could have done.]
;W[fi];B[eh];W[gi];B[hh]
(;W[hi]C[[Rich\] - to capture stones like this, you either need a ladder - this one doesn't work - or a net. See var.]
;B[ih];W[ii];B[jh];W[jg];B[kg];W[jf]
(;B[ki]C[[Rich\] - (2) I would have played as in the variation - keep the stones disconnected!]
;W[ji];B[kj];W[kh]C[Oops ! That was dumb. White in the middle is now much bigger than necessary.]
;B[kk];W[lj];B[li];W[mi];B[lh];W[jh];B[mk]C[I was glad I spotted this exploitation of white's bad shape here. I guess if white had spotted the trouble the obvious responses create for his lower right group, it would have been much smaller, so its a bit of a trick.

[Rich\] - You've still caught a couple of stones... but it's a fairly small move if white responds correctly.]

(;W[mj]C[[Rich\] - see var];B[nk];W[nl];B[ok];W[nj];B[pk]C[[Rich\] - Nicely played :)]
;W[nh];B[mg];W[lf];B[lg];W[mf];B[pe];W[pf];B[rf];W[ng];B[lb]
;W[mb];B[kb];W[mc];B[nb];W[od];B[pc];W[oe];B[nc];W[ns];B[os]
;W[ms];B[hj]C[So this is obviously wrong, especially given the white cut that follows. Its hard to know how far to fall back from  a wall like that. In this case black ends up with only three points in the middle !

[Rich\] - The points around H8 won;t add up to much for either player. The centre is always small once both players have live stones nearby. 

Points-wise, a play at H9 would probably have been best. But C2 is still much bigger :)]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[fk];B[ek];W[ei];B[di];W[dh];B[eg];W[ff];B[ef]
;W[ak];B[aj];W[al];B[cj];W[bi];B[bj];W[ch];B[bg]C[So in retrospect, I didn't spot what white was up to here. I reckoned he was trying to live inside, so this is an eye stealing move.

[Rich\] - I can't see what he's up to either :) That was a good move.]
;W[ap];B[aq];W[ao]
(;B[bq]C[[Rich\] - If you play as in the var., you're still alive after a ko as far as I can tell...]
;W[cr];B[dq];W[bs];B[br]C[Clearly I got this sequence wrong. Was it possible to save these stones on their own ?

[Rich\] - I think after white played this way, it's still a ko to kill...]
;W[pr];B[or];W[rp];B[qo];W[qq]C[So I'm not sure what white is doing here. I guess he could get a very small live group in the corner.

[Rich\] - Not if you play S2.];B[pq];W[rn];B[ro];W[qn];B[ql]

;B[hk];W[hl];B[il];W[hm];B[hn];W[fj];B[gp];W[gq];B[fo];W[eo]
C[This sequence was neat. I spotted that it was possible to kill the white group in the lower right. White is clearly aiming to kill the black group in the same area, so we end up cooperating in cutting this situation off from the obvious live groups.

[Rich\] - white's lower right is already dead, black's alive... but good thinking. :)]
;B[dm];W[em]C[[Rich\] - (2) BIG mistake for white... he must keep connected.]
;B[dn];W[ej]
(;B[dk]C[I retrospect I suspect this move was unncessary. It would probably have been better to play where white follows up.

[Rich\] - Well, it's not necessary, but the first time I read it out I thought it was. Playing where white follows up would be bad, see var.]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[ai];B[am];W[ci];B[an]C[I guess white just miscounted, or possibly failed to spot that his group was also vulnerable. Anyway, I was chuffed.]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[im];B[jm]
(;W[mh]C[[Rich\] - this is a dame point. See vars. for bigger plays.]
;B[ha];W[on]C[Note sure what white thinks he's doing here. It looks a bit desperate. I don't think the big black group isn't killable even if black does nothing. Anyway, I played it safe and took his stones off anway.

[Rich\] - Black can't be killed, and white can't survive, without black ignoring several plays. But each stone he plays balances out a stone you play, so you don't gain or lose points.]
