C[Imvatim [9k\]: hi

B wants the review also, but he said he isn't good at commenting...all comments will be for W.  I'll explain to my best logic, so tell me what is wrong with it.  Also, the most helpful thing imaginable is when you say where you would play if you were playing this game.

[wallace\] Hi, I'll do my best :)
Don't hesitate to ask if my explanations are not clear enough.]
;B[cd]C[neoKupo [9k\]: enjoy.];W[pc];B[pq];W[ec];B[df];W[dp]
C[this seemed common sense to me, tell me if i'm wrong

[wallace\] Well, what W played is possible, but answering in the upper left is possible too.

The question is rather, why did W play E17 before D4?

Anyway, no big problem here.];B[di]TR[ic][cj]C[[wallace\] not very good:
- 3rd line is better balance here,
- doesn't exploit the W tenuki (playing elsewhere) in the corner by pressing on E17 (D17, E16 J16 would be a possibility, but since W might ignore it, a pincer around J17 is probably better).]
;W[qf]TR[ec][hd][id]C[this looks bad to me, i couldn't find a good one.

[wallace\] Helping the isolated White stone at E17 seems the most natural choice to me (H17 and J17 are more usual, but the upper side would be too "flat")]
;B[po];W[jd]TR[id]C[[wallace\] good direction.
May be J16 would help E17 a bit more and still work with the upper right corner.]
;B[gc];W[cc];B[dd];W[dc];B[ge];W[bc];B[bd];W[fb];B[gb]TR[fb]
C[[wallace\] the last two moves seem slow:
F18 was not really compulsory, and answering is small, since there is still the threat of a cut between G15-G17 and D14-D16]

(;W[qm]C[[wallace\] yes, but R10 is more coherent with the upper right (see var).]
;B[qn]C[[wallace\] very small and reinforces W :(];W[pm];B[rm]
;W[rl];B[rn];W[qk]C[[wallace\] B took a 15 point corner, where he already had a shimari (2 stone enclosure), W is building a magnificent moyo!]
;B[fq];W[ip]C[my plan was for b to jump through, so i could live in his side territory

[wallace\] This seems like a greedy approach (jealous?)

if B jumps, W has 2 weak groups to care for (D4 and J4), which will be a big pain...

Instead, D6 would peacefully settle the corner and reduce the left side potential for B.

Moreover, B cannot close of all lower side with only one move, and even if he would W's upper right would be at least as big...]
;B[fo];W[dn]C[i didn't like this move];B[dr];W[cq];B[fm]TR[cq]
[dr]C[[wallace\] good, but better played before the marked exchange (more pressure on the corner)]
;W[lq];B[dl];W[cl]C[i didn't want to give up by playing c7...ended up losing big]
;B[cm];W[cn];B[dm];W[bm];B[bl];W[bn]TR[ip][lq]C[this wasn't sente at all...i should have played c2 immediately

[wallace\] yes
However, it is important for you to realize that being enclosed like that in the corner is not good, even if W lives.

B now has a good left side and the marked stones are still weak.]
;B[ck];W[cr];B[lc]
(;W[nc]C[[wallace\] Seems to be the wrong direction: push B toward your strength (see var)]
;B[le];W[jf];B[jb]C[i felt my w group could struggle and make an existance

[wallace\] W can live, but it would be easier if B had to struggle too, thus cutting him off would have been better.]
;W[hr]TR[jd][jf]SQ[lo]C[[wallace\] reinforcing toward the center (M5for instance) would probably help a little the two marked stones.]
;B[nr]LB[fp:A]TR[lg]C[i was thinking about the cut at A for a long time, but i never found a good enough time...

[wallace\] if the lower W group lives, then the cut is not interesting: W only captures 2 B stones while losing the initiative.
So W can keep the cut, in case there is a problem and for instance play in the center]
;W[np];B[no]TR[jh][in][on][lo]C[[wallace\] A contact play is not good for attacking: B will have to defend and lose a time.

Either really cut at P6 (but seems a bit slack), or build the center by attacking (combining the marked spots...).]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[op]LB[mn:A]C[bad move..i should have played A, right?

[wallace\] Well, yes A is better, however I think that the problem lies in O4, which should have been played more "toward the center" (M5 for instance).

One could also consider answering around O8 but since M13 hasn't been played it would probably not be very good.]
;B[oo];W[mn];B[lg];W[jh];B[li];W[gg]C[[wallace\] Yes!
defending by attacking is good.];B[gf];W[hf];B[jj];W[ij];B[ik]
;W[ji];B[kj];W[hj];B[qh];W[of]TR[ph]C[i wanted to protect the invasion, as i felt my other group could also squeeze out life.

[wallace\] yes but W can probably be quite aggressive here (Q12?) since there is so much W around.

True, it would be even better if M11-M17 was cut off, since then N12 or such would become a forcing move, but even now it seems possible to attack the invading stone.]
;B[oh];W[pi];B[ph];W[nm];B[mm];W[lm];B[ml]LB[mp:A]C[I played this sequence to protect a cut at A, should I have done differently?

[wallace\] it's ok, but more because it helps all the lower side group than just because of the two O4-P4 stones which are not very important.]

;W[im];B[jm];W[hn]C[was there a better move?];B[kl];W[dh];B[ch]
;W[ei]C[i felt like backing out on this one

[wallace\] and rightly so: B should have cut at E12 instead of C12]
;B[dj];W[pp];B[qp];W[fp];B[gp]LB[fn:A]C[I played it anyway, i thought about A, but i didn't see it working.

[wallace\] none of those is working. Thus play bigger endgame moves (A16, E2, S13, ...)]
;W[ep];B[go];W[er]C[was this the right time?

[wallace\] well, A16 is big sente, but after that one, E2 is big, yes.]

[wallace\] I don't think so:
- B captures first,
- W has lots of weak groups,
- even if W wins, if B captures N18 he hasn't lost a point (but loses the initiative)
- W seems slightly ahead];B[nb];W[ob];B[oc];W[fn];B[en];W[nc]
;B[ir]C[[wallace\] B should avoid threats that give away points... (upper left better)]

Hmmm...
White had a good beginning (especially thanks to B playing D11 and R6), but overplayed a bit on the lower side.
When B invaded the top and W let him connect underneath I think B gained the upper hand back, however, B never managed to attack seriously any of the 6 (!!!) W groups, and W defended them well. The result is thus very close...

To improve, W should strive for a better connection between his groups (fewer weak groups, play more toward the center).
W could then try to attack (never did here, but could when B invaded the top or the right side).

Technically speaking, W did a few mistakes (not-working cut in the lower left, giving points during a ko, etc...) but since there was no serious Life and death trouble I cannot say. (however a little L&D is good at any level). Shapes were roughly sound, which is rare at that level.

Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask if there's something unclear left (I'm not much under wallace on KGS anymore, e-mail me or try gromit ;) [that's me too\]]
)
(;W[kc];B[ld];W[jf];B[nd];W[pe];B[mg];W[kh]C[[wallace\] W builds his right side and chases B, the W group is ahead of the B one...]

(;W[qj];B[ql]C[[wallace\] if B approcahes...];W[oj]C[[wallace\] W is very happy!]
