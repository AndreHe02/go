;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[ci];B[ce];W[fc];B[cc]C[This is a bit too direct of black, i think.
bB17 would look nicer. Later on white will approach in the same way...]
;W[cb];B[bc];W[dd];B[cd];W[jd]C[This extension is quite good, making use of the UL group. Could be perhaps bit more right (M16 still would work fine).
Or attack B more closer:
N17 or 16];B[mc];W[nq];B[qm];W[pq]C[I think white shouldn't do this but go the other direction. Perhaps jumping out to the starpoint on K4 or jump by two to L3 would work better.
Trying to invade into "black's corner" which is well connected with bR7 now, without having a strong group yourself, doesn't seem promising...]
;B[qq];W[pr];B[lq]C[I'm not sure how to respond to this.  My thought was to sqeeze, since just jumping out to O5 could have given black a huge wall (M5, M7, etc).


I'd just go for most eye-space possible. wR2, wN2 would serve this need in a limited way.
Trying to get out with wP4 would also look good (see Variation).
So first build up a more stable base before attacking...]
(;W[jq];B[lo]C[Perhaps it would have been better, if this wall came by wO5? It would at least have helped to escape, but now B is one step in front.]
;W[no];B[hq]C[I thought about M2 here, to connect.

wM2 wouldn't work. b could choose between L2 or N2 to cut. bN2 at the same time would attack w's weak group around there.]

(;W[op];B[po];W[nm];B[jp];W[ok];B[pk];W[oj]C[Now W forces B to enclose the side with bQ13 here.
It would be better if W jumped in there himself.];B[pg];W[oh]
;B[ph];W[li]C[This is a symptom of my most recent concern, getting a lot of influence in the center of the board.

I suspect I was too concerned about that in this game.



Looking at B's huge and solid territory on the right side you are probably right. You should have made B more trouble building up his territory.
And why influence in the center? "There is no territory in the center" - what a cost!]
;B[cn];W[cl];B[en];W[el]C[I guess you know, but playing on F3 or 4 would have done a better job. Since wE8 strengthens an already strong group it's not needed. Go and help wD4!
(F3, F4)];B[fp];W[fq];B[eq]C[I don't see how to get this corner to live for w.
(See variation for a "nice try" which also doesn't work)

After something like this happened it's good not to try to rescue stones by all means but to use them as a potential (aji). I.e. playing from the outside using the existence of these stones, perhaps threating to rescue them while not really wanting to. At the same time building up something other.
It's hard for me to give a good example here...]
(;W[er];B[fr];W[gq];B[gp];W[gr];B[dr];W[fs];B[dq];W[hr]C[But this one is an example of aji, though very local, but it works:
You wanted to connect the K3-stone to the right group. Now it helps getting this G2 group two eyes. B can't play J2. He'll be cut then. So W can expand to J2 for himself...]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[jr]C[...which gives enough room for living.]
;W[kq]C[I'd just leave it alone. B won't make the same mistake twice and this way you help him strengthening his territory...]
;B[kr];W[is]C[I thought a long time about this move.  L4 would have been a wasted stone, so I decided to take care of life for the G2 group.


Well, yes, but that group is already alive. It already has got one eye and a three-stone leg. B can't prevent W from living here.
So play elsewhere!
(This is a standard living shape. It would be different if it ended at J2 with a black stone. Then you would have to play H1. But here: unnecessary!)
Use the chance to play somewhere else on the board.];B[kp]C[I think that this move is also unnecessary. B doesn't have to look for two eyes. He's got the big base on LL to connect to.]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[me];B[jb];W[ic];B[kc];W[kd];B[cg];W[dg];B[df]
;W[ef];B[ib];W[de]C[B does not necessarily have to answer wD15. He could just go on with H18 e.g. or somewhere around J8.]
;B[cf];W[fg];B[gm]C[This is also a proper move to build up moyo. Though open to the right.]
;W[fm];B[fn];W[dm]C[That m-shape at
D7 made me feel odd.  It still does.


I can't see why it does!?];B[dh];W[eg];B[ch];W[di];B[fl];W[dn]
;B[cp];W[do];B[ep]C[B goes the save way and connects.];W[co]
;B[bo];W[em];B[gl];W[fi];B[lm]C[B already built up a nice moyo here.
Perhaps white's next move should be J11, J10 or K10 to secure own moyo on the top side and to prepare to invade into B's.]
;W[bp]C[Useless with C7 open.

Yepp, you say it...
(could be useful as a ko-threat later on)];B[cq];W[nd];B[nc]
;W[od];B[oc];W[oe]C[This one is a little slow.  Playing on P13 or H18 to block black is better.]
;B[pe];W[ij];B[il];W[lk];B[kl];W[kk];B[ml]C[Black wants to cut the white group apart. The LR would have hard and little life then..
wO8 or P8 wouldn't allow black to cut.]
(;W[mk];B[nl];W[ol];B[om]C[bP7 now cut the white group apart.
w should look for life with the lower part now.];W[on];B[pm]
;W[pn];B[qn];W[oo]C[I've somehow convinced black to shore up the entire right side.]

See in the variation how 'b' would have worked.]

;W[pi];B[qi]C[Someone told me that this is 'always' a good thing to do:
breaking the opponents wall and strengthening the own group through connection.]

Yes, both moves would be good and fit the need...];B[nr];W[or]
;B[ms];W[os];B[mp];W[ns]C[Just like wO9: there are bigger moves than this. More important moves.
E.G. L10 or F9

In the Endgame always think about which moves are most urgent, make more points or prevent a loss.  1-point moves come last!]

C[I think the game is clearly lost for white at this point... probably earlier, too.


W has no effective territory in the corners, just towards the center. B has lots of territory on UR und LM.]
;W[gi];B[eo];W[ag];B[af];W[ah];B[be]C[This was a good move for black.  I suspect I might have fallen into my own trap, and made the dead-5 group.


You have to pay attention to moves creating good shape and living positions. You also have to think about if they are needed now (bB15) or could be also played later (wJ1).]

;W[qc]C[This should have taken place *much* earlier in the game, I think.  I'm not sure there is any way to make a 3-3 invasion work with black so strong in this corner.  I'd love to know if there is. :)


I really can't tell you. But I agree with you that if you plan to invade on 3-3 it has to happen much earlier in the game.
W here has no chance to build a living position, especially because there are no serious defects in black's wall which white could use as threats.]
