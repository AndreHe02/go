C[[kb\]: Hello,

The game was interesting.  Many mistakes were made on both sides, but White failed to capitalize in a position that could have recovered the game and Black was able to win easily even after making some point mistakes.

Please try and work on your middle game, and understand the long-term implications of your moves.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[op];W[lp];B[cn]C[tenuki ok?

[kb\]: Unusual but possible.  White should play at lower left.]
;W[fd]C[[kb\]: This move is to soft - defending the left side or playing Q6 to attack the P4 stone are better.]
;B[fq]C[[kb\]: Good.];W[eo];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[gp]C[[kb\]: Better at D7.  This doesn't expand White's lower framework, and allows Black a great move at...]
;B[do]C[[kb\] ...D5, to which White's shape is spoiled.];W[ep]
;B[en]C[[kb\]: Beautiful shape by Black, who is clearly ahead in the opening now.]
;W[fn];B[fm];W[gn];B[df]C[better to ccome back to E7?

[kb\]: Yes, this move is important, but not urgent.  E7 keeps better strategic position and is more solid.]
;W[em];B[dn];W[el]C[[kb\]: Obviously.  Now Black loses ground, and White looks forward to playing further to disrupt what should have been Black's territory.]
;B[pm];W[pp]C[seems to be a trickplay... how to punish?

[kb\]: This is a joseki variation.  All things equal Black should come out a little ahead locally, but of course there is the very thick White wall to the left.  Ideally, White splitting Black into two not-quite-settled groups should be the aim here.

Is that the right move?  Let's investigate...];B[oo];W[oq];B[nq]
;W[np]
(;B[mq]C[[kb\]: This is one of two reasonable Black options, but unfortunately, in the main line, White gets a good result in this position.

Look at the variation for a safer option.];W[or];B[mp];W[no]

(;B[on]C[[kb\]: Joseki is to push one more time, but Black does OK deviating.  See variation.]
;W[mo];B[lo];W[nm];B[kp]TR[mq]C[is the rsult after this sequence okay for black?

[kb\]: Not ideal, but perhaps better than the main line after Black N3.  White has the corner and has a group to attack.  Black has a strong group against White's thickness now, and White is lacking points, but Black's group is quite weak.]
;W[pk]C[correct way to attack black?

[kb\]: Yes. This is a powerful, shape-breaking move, played on the vital point.]
;B[ol]C[[kb\]: Painful, but no choice.]
(;W[lm]C[[kb\]: There is little reason not to force at M6.  White loses tempo.]
;B[qr]C[[kb\]: Premature.];W[ro]C[[kb\]: Good response.];B[pq]
C[i think its aji keshi, isnt it?

[kb\]: Clearly.];W[pr];B[qq];W[rq];B[rr];W[sr];B[ok];W[pi]C[[kb\]: Now that S5 is in place, this move is questionable... Q10, to put more pressure on Black, would be more severe.]
;B[ml];W[mm];B[rs];W[sq];B[qo];W[rp];B[oj];W[pg]C[[kb\]: Better at R12 - now White's shape on the right is too thin.]
;B[pj];W[qj];B[qk]
(;W[ri]C[better atari at S9?

[kb\]: No - it doesn't work.  See variations.  There are a lot of lines, but they all lead to White failures.]
;B[oc]LB[lm:A][pi:B][pg:C]C[[kb\]: Although Black played many aji keshi moves, Black largely succeeded - two stable groups were constructed in White's sphere of influence, AND Black somehow had time to get the first large move on the board?  Black maintains the lead.

The marked moves are where White went wrong - they are each a 'half-move' or so that combine to around 1.5 moves lost, which gives Black sente and a secure group.]
;W[rk]C[[kb\]: Secure but slow.];B[ql]C[[kb\]: What?  If Black is worried about this group, it is MUCH better to jump into the center, forcing White to connect the weakish group.]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[dd];B[ed];W[de];B[ce]C[E15 is joseki... is this possible too?

[kb\]: Anything is possible, but Black does not need to be adventurous - just play normally.]
;W[ee];B[ec];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[bg];W[ch]
(;B[fc]C[[kb\]: This isn't possible.  Black needs to capture the 3-3 stone now.]
;W[bc];B[fe];W[ef];B[ad];W[ae];B[be];W[bh];B[cb];W[bb];B[db]
;W[bd]C[black is captured... where did black go wrong? however if black did not die, whites position would be very bad, so did white play correct?]
;B[gd];W[nd];B[lc]C[looks strange is it bad? i did not want to crawl and play o17

[kb\]: Yes, this is bad. O17 is not 'crawling' it is securing your corner.]
;W[nc];B[od]
(;W[ne]C[[kb\]: Heavy.  How about P18?];B[qh];W[ph];B[of]
(;W[pf]C[what would happen if white played p15 instead of this move?

[kb\]: see variation, doesn't work.  Also, White should play R13 instead, which still threatens to connect, while making the right group alive.]
;B[oe];W[kd]C[the result after this move was bad. where should white have played instead of this move?

[kb\]: M15 is fine.];B[ld];W[le];B[ke];W[lf]LB[le:A][ke:B][kd:C]
[ld:D][lf:E]C[[kb\]: This is similar to White playing A first, then cutting B with C, which is obviously bad.]
;B[je];W[ie];B[jd];W[mj]C[[kb\]: This move tries to do too much, but there is no other way for White at this point.

White could try to kill the lower Black group.];B[mk];W[lh]
C[[kb\]: Black simply plays M10 and the game is effectively over.]
;B[kg];W[lg]C[submissive? or solid? ;)

[kb\]: Black's move was aji keshi.];B[lj];W[jg]C[[kb\]: I don't understand White's moves.]
;B[kh];W[kf];B[jf];W[ig];B[ki];W[nh];B[ii]C[too slow?

[kb\]: No, it is good.];W[jm];B[fg]C[[kb\]: This one could be slow, since it's just capturing stones, and not securing the Black dragon.  How about J3, which threatens to pull F3 out?]
;W[iq]C[[kb\]: Largest point on the board.];B[nr];W[ss];B[ip]
C[[kb\]: Mistake?];W[hq];B[jq]C[life and death status?

[kb\]: Alive now.];W[fi];B[eg];W[dg];B[ff];W[df];B[ei];W[if]
;B[id]C[[kb\]: Unnecessary.];W[jo]
(;B[lq]C[correct response? how to live?

[kb\]: This move doesn't even gain you an eye.  J2 looks good.

End of comments.  The rest of the game, while reasonable from a ko fighting perspective, shouldn't have happened in the first place and don't make sense in the context of the game for reviewing.]
