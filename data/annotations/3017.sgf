;B[cp];W[pd];B[eq];W[dd];B[pp]C[Bildstein: The first five moves show good opening by both players.]
;W[nq];B[qn]
(;W[kq]C[Bildstein: I'd expect Q2 R3 first (see variation).]

(;B[ci]LB[cj:D][cf:C][ck:B][cl:A]C[scriabin: I want to extend away from the shimari; what is a good point?

Bildstein: C11 is good, but I wouldn't call it an extension. Maybe it is, though. Other good extensions would be A, B and C, although C isn't really an extension at all.

A is good because it creates real territory, and any closer would be playing too close to your own strength and inneficient.

B is good because it leaves room for a further two-space extension to C12 even if White extens to C14.

C is good because if White doesn't pincer, an extension to C11 (after the B16 C17 exchange) works wonders for Black, with the shimari to support it.

D doesn't work too well, because after White C14, an extension towards the top would be cramped, and an extension towards the bottom would be inefficient, because it would be too close to the strong shimari.

Of course, don't try to remember these extensions. Instead try to remember the reasoning behind them. But that goes for everything I have to say, probably.]

(;W[cm]C[scriabin: This sort of invasion is supposed to be dangerous for White. But the question remains, what is the best way to take advantage of it? Some sort of pincer, maybe C9?

Bildstein: You don't really need to punish it. It's too close to your strong corner enclosure (proverb: "Play away from strength") to force you to reply.

True, you could pincer with C9, and that would be a fine move, but the move you made was actually better, because it served as an approach to D16 as well as an extension from C11, and by strengthening C11 you also weakened C7.

White 10 should have at C9. See variation.];B[cf]C[Bildstein: A good move, making a base for C11 and attacking D16 at the same time.]
;W[ce];B[df]C[Bildstein: Correct again.];W[cj]C[scriabin: Not a good sign.

Bildstein: I'd say that it was a good sign. Your left group had nothing to worry about. It was strong enough. White is clutching at straws.]
;B[dj]C[Bildstein: White could have made this messy, with the cut at D11. I can't say how it would have gone, but I don't think it would have been a good move for White. The question you have to ask, though, is did you consider it? If you did, that's fine.]
;W[bj];B[dk]C[Bildstein: Nice fighting spirit, and it strengthens the Black group at the same time.]
;W[ck];B[dl]C[Bildstein: Now you're starting to get that influence you talked about.]
;W[bi];B[ch];W[bh]C[Bildstein: Okay, now it's time to talk about influence. The first thing here is that with the top and right sides still open, you shouldn't be worrying about making territory in the center - it's just too darn hard.]

(;B[hh]LB[ed:B][cc:A][pf:G][qf:G][nd:F][nc:F][pr:E][pj:D][kc:C]
[fc:B]C[scriabin: To my current tastes this is modest. I always like to extend away from walls, but I don't often succeed in converting the area into territory. That is the big question in this game - what to do with the influence. What is a better way to proceed?

Bildstein: In this case, either attacking White's top left with A (see variation) or B, taking a big point with something like C (with room to extend on either side) or D, securing territory with E, or approaching Q16 with F or G.]
;W[hq]C[scriabin: Well that was one possibility.

Bildstein: It's smaller than all the moves I mentioned last move.]
;B[cl];W[bl];B[dm];W[cn];B[dn];W[fg]C[scriabin: How best to deal with such a confrontation? I reacted aggressively.

Bildstein: I'd have done the same. And you do well in the fight that ensues, at least for a while.]
;B[gf];W[ef];B[ee];W[fi];B[hj];W[gi];B[hi];W[fk];B[gm];W[gl]
;B[hl];W[fm];B[gk];W[fl];B[gn];W[gj];B[hk];W[di]C[scriabin: Now all hell breaks loose. Perhaps my wall wasn't "thick" enough to play with this aggressive plan?]
;B[cg];W[dh]
(;B[ej]C[scriabin: A useful point, but connecting above was more sensible perhaps.

Bildstein: I think so (see variation).];W[de]
(;B[ei]C[scriabin: Seems to be correct.

Bildstein: I agree.];W[eh]
(;B[ff];W[eg];B[gh]C[scriabin: An interesting battle; both sides gain and lose.]
;W[bf]
(;B[fj]C[scriabin: One of two equivalent possibilities.];W[bg]
;B[fh];W[fe];B[ed]LB[ge:A]C[Bildstein: Better to push at A. Black 63 is just throwing away a stone.]
;W[fd]
(;B[lk]C[scriabin: Again extending away from a wall. Is this good, or necessary? How should Black plan the game and make use of all that influence?

Bildstein: There's a big difference between extending from a wall along the edge of the board, and extending from a wall into the middle of the board. Here, you should be leaving your wall right along. The correct move would be something like Q10, if you're interested in secure territory, or something like Q13, if you'd rather take more territory that you deserve and make White fight for any that he wants.

What you have to realise about your influence is that you can turn it into territory, like you did with Black 65, but White can't, whereas the right side can become Black or White territory. So your options are:

1. Take the side, and get territory there and the potential of all the territory between the right side and your wall.

2. Make some territory near your wall, with a move like Black 65, and let white make territory on the right side.]
;W[pj]C[Bildstein: White takes the territory.];B[lh]C[scriabin: At the moment this strikes me as a slow way to make not all that much territory. How else to use the thickness, though?

Bildstein: You are right about it not making territory. Again, you should leave your influence.

The best thing about walls that face the middle of the board, like yours, is that you can leave them alone and they can stop your opponent making territory. For example, with that wall to run to, you could have started a fight with move 67 at Q12.]
;W[nj]C[Bildstein: A useless move by White. What's it trying to achieve? He could be making real territory with a move like Q12, instead.]

(;B[nc]LB[jq:C][pr:B][qk:A]TR[kq][hq]C[Bildstein: A reasonable time to kakari. Other moves worth considering were A, B and C, to mention a few.

A makes territory while attacking.

B makes territory at the same time as stopping White from playing Q2 R3 in sente.

C is a move that you might not consider, but White's two-space jump on the third line (marked /\) stops being strong when Black has a lot of influence around it. One example line of play is given.]
;W[lc];B[gg];W[ec];B[le]C[Bildstein: Not a good move. Although it makes a little territory to the left, it seems to be leaving O17 for dead.]
;W[md]C[Bildstein: White cuts, of course.];B[qc]C[Bildstein: O17 can't be saved in any profitable way now, so this is definately the right move. It makes as good use of O17 as I can see is possible.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[rf]C[scriabin: Is the double-hane a good choice for White here?

Bildstein: No. Maybe White didn't know joseki, and thought that you'd defend at S16. But the double hane in this joseki is better for Black unless white has more strength on the outside than he does here.]
;B[qf];W[pe];B[rg];W[rd];B[sf];W[rc]TR[pj][nj]C[Bildstein: Now White's /\ stones are looking a bit silly.]

(;B[qi]TR[nj][pj]SQ[re][sf][rg][qf]MA[oh]C[Bildstein: You're [\] stones are fine, and you don't need to worry about protecting them yet (after all, they can live with a simple S12). Black 87 should have been spent attacking White's /\ with X, for example.]
;W[oh];B[pi]C[Bildstein: Now you are attacking, but it's a little too late.]
;W[oi];B[qj];W[pk];B[qk];W[pg]
(;B[qg]C[Bildstein: Definately not needed. It doesn't cut or threaten to cut White off, and the Black group didn't need defending. This move simply gives up sente.]
;W[id]C[Bildstein: A good move by White. It makes territory on the top while reducing Black's territory.]
;B[if];W[kf]C[scriabin: An aggressive ploy; can he get away with it?

Bildstein: No, and it turns out you didn't let him. White was Well ahead at this point. If he had played defensively, and kept control of the top side and kept his bottom group alive, he would have won by a lot more than he did. You invasion of the top side cost him a lot.

From now until move 120, you can assume if I make no comment it's because you played a good move: Your invasion of the top side was impressive.]

(;B[ga]C[scriabin: Black is making huge gains every which way. The game is close.

Bildstein: Black 115 should have been at H19. Then F19 wouldn't have warrented a response (until the late end game).]
;W[jc];B[jb];W[fa];B[ib];W[jd];B[kn]C[scriabin: This ought to have gone up above instead where the territory was leaking.

Bildstein: Possibly, but I don't think so. Black 121 as played makes a lot of territory (for this stage in the game). The upper area just needed more careful defense.]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[ke]
(;B[kg]C[scriabin: I thought this would work, but ..

Bildstein: Understandable, but L12 would have been much safer.]
;W[kh];B[lg];W[li];B[ki];W[kj];B[ji];W[lj]C[scriabin: White has destroyed a big chunk of territory; this seems to happen in many games where I stake out central territory like this.

Bildstein: It's true. The influence your wall gave you achieved very little.]
;B[kk];W[jj];B[jk];W[ho]
(;B[hn];W[io];B[in]SQ[hn]C[Bildstein: After Black 139, [\] is acheiving very little. Black 137 should have been played at 139 instead.]
;W[fo]
(;B[fn]C[Bildstein: You should have attacked at G5 first, and held F6 in reserve in case later you couldn't cut F5 off. I think you could have cut F5 off completely (see variation).]

C[Bildstein: Finally :)];W[jo];B[jn];W[mk];B[ml];W[nl];B[mm]
;W[nm];B[lo];W[lp]C[Bildstein: We're definately in the endgame now. Remember the rules of the end-game:

- A play is "sente" if you playing first will mean your opponent playing last (locally) (sente for you), but if your opponent plays first, he will also still play last (gote for your opponent).
- If a play is sente for you, but also for your opponeny, it is called "double sente".
- A play is "gote" only if whoever plays there first will end up playing last too (i.e. gote for both players).
- If a play is gote for you, but sente for your opponent, then it is called "reverse sente".

Double sente point should be taken at the first opportunity, by whichever player can get it. There is no excuse for leaving it.

When you have sente, you should make sente plays until you don't have any left.

Only then should you play a reverse sente or gote move. And generally when it comes to losing sente, you should play the biggest reverse sente play, unless there is a gote play that's twice as big.]
;B[mo];W[mp];B[no]C[Bildstein: Doesn't acheive anything, and doesn't warrent a response (approximately zero points in gote).]
;W[pm]C[Bildstein: Sente for White.];B[qm];W[pn]
(;B[po]C[Bildstein: Not really needed. He still could not cut in at R5 (see variation).]
;W[oq];B[pq];W[or]C[Bildstein: Revese sente for White. A monkey jump to N1 by Black would cost White a lot.]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[fs]C[Bildstein: Should have been at E1, so that White G1 wouldn't be a serious threat.]
;W[gs];B[fp];W[gq];B[dr]C[Bildstein: This should have been at E2, for two reasons. One is that Black 173 as played gives White two more ko threats, at E2 and then D1 (and you never know when a small ko might develop in the end game). The second is that F1, F2 might somehow still get taken (as it does).]
;W[bp]
