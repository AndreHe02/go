C[In this game I am black.  Near the end I lose focus and win an easily won game.  However many of my questions are about the middle game.

Chris: My answers are prefixed with "Chris: ". Instead of overloading you with variations, I will try to focus on main points in the game, especially to try and simplify the game such that non-sensical fights (hopefully) end badly for the one who started.

;W[pq];B[mp];W[hq];B[jq];W[eq];B[dq];W[cn]LB[eq:12][cn:14]C[Chris: After seeing this, I expected White to be much weaker than the indicated rank. To keep your calm, we should analyse the board position:

W12 is in a horrible position and the whole group is as good as base-less. W14 is in an OK spot, but getting a good result on both sides is impossible for White.
Question: Where is the vital point for the bottom White group?]

(;B[bo]C[Chris: This move is bad, it does not punish White overplay. It shows greed, "just" taking the corner. Or do you seriously think, that with such weakness outside, White can attack you at all?]
;W[co];B[bp];W[cp];B[cq];W[bn]C[Chris: Horrible by White. Now he has two base-less groups; if Black plays correctly.]

LB[qo:A][qj:B][jc:C]C[This seems small, but I was hoping to get to the two white stones.

Chris: This is not small, in fact it is one of the most urgent, and pointwise also very big on board, on Par with A and B and C]
;W[ph]C[Where best for b?]
(;B[qj]C[Chris: This seems wrong direction as White gains some strength in the centre, helping his floating group.]
;W[pj];B[qh]C[Chris: The invasion here is greedy, top side is bigger, attacking centre group is most urgent. These can probably be considered thank-you moves, as the influence will help White settle the centre group.]

;B[lm];W[jc]C[Chris: W got tedomari, big loss for Black. The last 30 moves should be studied very carefully by Black. He should spend considerable time thinking about how to exploit the weakness of Whites floating centre group during the entire game. 

Observe how
1.) the technique of leaning attacks can be employed to make an attack more severe. 
2.) How the direction of play is directed by weak groups on the board
3.) The shape issues of attacking especially in the beginning.

This is the last comment, I think the rest of the games is pointless battles. Black will gain 2 stones if the middlegame concepts mentioned so far are thoroughly grasped.]
