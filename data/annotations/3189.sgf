AB[pd][dd][dp]C[This game is from round 2 of the Toyota-Denso cup in Brisbane, Australia.

Dear Alexander,
I think that in general you should play a little more agressive  then usual when you play white in handicap games. In this game, you missed some opportunities to do so. I'll try to show you where and what could have been some alternatives.
Frank];W[po];B[jq];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj];B[cj];W[fc];B[cc]C[Alex: This was a very unexpected reply from black, but I wasn't sure how to respond.]
;W[ic]C[F: I think this is a good response.];B[kc]
(;W[db]C[Alex: Is this too slow?
F: Definitely too slow. Black just took the corner, so there is no point in playing there. If you want to strengthen your group, it's better to play towardt the center. See variation]
;B[cg]
(;W[cq]C[F: I think this is a little bit premature. This invasion makes black very strong on the outside. See variation]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[cn];W[fr]
;B[gq];W[pq];B[mq]SQ[ij]C[F: Black could try to make more use of his influence by playing in the center, around the squared point, but this isn't bad eiher.]
;W[ej];B[dj]C[Alex: Another surprise for me.]
(;W[ei]C[F: You're playing in the black sphere of influence, so I  think you should try to play a little bit "lighter". See variation]
;B[eg];W[hi];B[ek];W[fk];B[fl];W[gk];B[gl]
(;W[hl]C[Alex: I should cut first.
F: yes];B[hm]
(;W[im];B[hn]
(;W[mo]C[F: I think you should play once more in the center. After 42 black destroys much of the strength you build there, which will be a big disadvantage for you later in the game. Sometimes you have to be patient...]
;B[il];W[hk];B[jm]C[F: Your centre group suddenly becomes weak instead of strong.]
;W[of];B[pl]C[Alex: I thought this was an overplay, but black ended up doing well out of it.
F: Since black has an escaping route to the centre, this is not so much of an overplay.]

(;W[qm]C[F: I'm not sure what's the best way to attack here, but since black has friends in the centre, I would attack from the upper side. See variation]
;B[ql];W[rm];B[qj];W[pi]C[F: Here you should play hane, to put more pressure on black]
;B[qi];W[ph]C[F: Hane! This is way too easy for black.];B[rg]
C[Alex: Should I try to kill all the black stones now?
F: Killing is not possible, since he can escape to the centre]
;W[nk]C[F: This is probably about the best you can do.];B[pm]
;W[pn]LB[qo:a]C[Alex: Later on, this turned out to be bad shape.  Is there a better way?

F: I'm not sure if this is bad shape. It puts some more pressure on black. The alternative would be a (R5)]
;B[nm];W[ll];B[jk]
(;W[lp]C[F: You could be more severe. See variations.];B[lq]
;W[rf];B[qg];W[pg];B[rl];W[sg];B[nn];W[no];B[lm];W[ln];B[mm]

(;W[lj]C[Alex: Instead I can cut, but I think it works out badly for me...
F: Before you decide to (try to) cut, you should have a look a the global situation:
Black has:
-55 points on the left and lower side
-8 points on the upper side
=total of 63
White has: 
-8 points left lower corner
-8 point left upper side
-15 points right lowercorner
= 31
So white has to make more than 30 points in the centre to win. Problem is that the centre is open on two sides (left and lower side; the upper side you could close by leaning on the black group there). So making 30 points will be almost impossible.
Conclusion: if you want to win, you HAVE to cut and try to kill the black group. That's not easy, as you discovered in your variations, but here or there I have some alternatives that would do the job. Let's have a look]
;B[kn]C[F: The coclusion is that maybe you could have killed black and won the game, maybe not and then the result would have been the same.]
;W[le];B[jb];W[ib]C[Alex: Who is winning here?  It seemed to me that the game was very close at this point.  Can white make enough territory in the centre?

F: No. See the earlier comments];B[jj];W[kh];B[or];W[pr];B[kp]
