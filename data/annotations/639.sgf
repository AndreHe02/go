B made several mistakes in the endgame (e.g. while chasing the weak right W group) which cost him the game in the end.
Also, black made several tactical errors during the fighting. Lessons learned from this game:

- early invasions (such as W's on the right) are a good opportunity to build strength and influence. Shut the opponent in and be happy.
- don't attach what you're attacking (instead play away from it - like the leaning attack on the top)
- attacking weak groupps is not about killing, but taking profit. The game would be much closer if B had attacked weak W group on the right from the right direction and made points while attacking).
- in the late endgame plays at the edge of the board are usually worth more than protecting single stones.]
