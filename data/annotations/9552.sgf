C[UR: Hi, I'm Uwe and I'll review your game. Thank you for sharing it.

I'll mark my comments with UR.];B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp]
(;B[nq]LB[cn:A][ce:B]C[UR: Don't attack from this side.
With D17 and D4 its easyier to attack with A or build a framework with B.
See the variations for details.];W[qn];B[pr];W[qq];B[kq];W[qk]
LB[ce:A][de:B]C[UR: This white move is a mistake. White should attack with A or B.]

(;B[oc]LB[cn:A]C[UR: Since white doesn't attack you, you don't need to defend your corner yet.

An attack with D4 (A) would be much better and is sente. After that you can play P17]
;W[de]
(;B[dd]LB[dh:B][ce:A]C[UR: This move actually helps white to build up a strong force, just play a "normal" move like  A or B]
;W[ce];B[ee];W[gc]LB[jc:A]C[UR: This white move is realy bad, now he has two week groups.

Again, don't defend to quickly. A cut at E16 isn't realy a thread. It's much better to attack and build a framework with K17. Since this is the best move for white to establish a base, it's yours too.]

(;B[fd]C[See variation];W[jc];B[dh];W[cg];B[ch];W[dg];B[eg]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[bg]
(;B[cj]LB[eh:A]C[UR: Don't defend this cut. Its more effectiv to defend at A or to play somewhere else.]
;W[bc];B[cn]C[UR: Good move!]
(;W[co]C[UR: This move is a good answere. If white had played a normal move, he would have losed a lot os points]
;B[dn];W[fq]C[UR: Now is a good time to breathe deeply and have a closer look at the board.
The game is very close (i think white is leading with a 1 or 2 points now).

Since you need to gain a few points and E12 (your only weakness) is handable, search for the big points.

There are only 3 big points left. R11 is the biggest one, but gote. And there are H3 and M17 which are equally good.
It's also possible to attack the corner with C3]
(;B[hq];W[bn];B[bm];W[bo]
(;B[fr]C[UR: Way to small. R11 and M17 are more important. 
R11 is the biggest but M17 is sente];W[er]
(;B[qh]C[UR: R11 is better. Don't be afraid, you're strong in this area too and with R11 is't harder for white to find a good invasion points]
;W[qf]C[UR: A classic example of overplay.]
(;B[pf]C[UR: Rember the proverb: Don't touch weak stones.

This move only helps white, it makes his stone stronger.

I think Q13 is the best way to deal with it.];W[qg];B[pg];W[qe]

(;B[pe]C[UR: Don't answere every move. You gain nothing more then a wall that can't expand very far

Play S12 instead and rob this group of its base];W[rd];B[qc]
;W[rh];B[qi];W[rc]
(;B[lc]C[UR: Good move! It is sente. But now you see that your expansionl is way to close to your wall.

Its also possible to play S11.];W[je]
(;B[le]C[UR: This move is to small. You gain only a few points and it's easy for white to live.

S11 is sente and white loses alot of points];W[jg];B[lg]C[UR: Too small again, just another 6 points and gote]
;W[ef];B[ff];W[df]
(;B[fh]C[UR: With this move you gave white alot of opportunities.
It is better to protect this cut directly with F13.];W[gg];B[fg]
;W[ei];B[eh];W[ek]
(;B[dk]C[UR: Wrong direction. This move only protects a few points. It is better to split and attack the white groups with H11 or G10.
S11 is still important.];W[ri]C[UR: This move is really big now.
White is leading with 15 Points.];B[qj];W[rj];B[qr];W[rr];B[pq]
;W[rq]
(;B[ni]C[UR: Don't play in your own territory!
As you've seen it doesn't protect the cut and you gain nothing.

The best move now is G10 to attack the left side or play Q9]
;W[pj]
(;B[pi];W[oi]
(;B[oh]C[UR: I don't know if this was a mistake or you feared to consequences of a connection.]
;W[ph]
(;B[ng]C[UR: If you need to protect, try to find a move that accomplishes more then just that. O10 is a good move to gain more.
On the other hand, i think G10 is much more important];W[nj]
C[UR: White is now leading a big time (more then 20 points).
But at least you have no weak groups.

On the other hand white has one : E9 / 11
Attack with G10]
(;B[op];W[po]
(;B[oo]C[UR: This move helps white to gain another 7 points and you gain nothing.
If you want to play in this area you should consider O6];W[on]
;B[nn];W[nm];B[om]C[UR: helping white again];W[pn];B[mm];W[nl]
C[UR: Now White has much more points  and you lost sente (you need to protect)]
;B[mn]
(;W[ml]C[UR: This move is to slack, he can easily reduce your framework with J6 or save his group E9/11]
;B[jn];W[gr];B[hr];W[fs];B[ho]C[UR: to small and lost sente again
-> G10];W[cl];B[bl];W[dl]
(;B[ck]C[UR: I think a cut is better. Try to fight more, especially when you're behind]
;W[fl];B[em];W[el];B[ej];W[fj];B[di]C[UR: The past moves are all good]
;W[fi]
(;B[he]C[UR: But now you should split both groups and attack the weaker one.]
;W[id];B[hd];W[hc];B[fc];W[fm]
(;B[cm]C[UR: Too defensive! Play F6];W[il]
(;B[jl]C[UR: Attaching isn't always good. You're forcing white to build a framework and gain points while you secure yours.
If you want to play in the center L8 is better.];W[jk];B[kl]
;W[im];B[in];W[kk];B[hg];W[gh];B[ih];W[hi]
(;B[ii]C[UR: Don't play to much in one region of the board, now its time to secure points on the top side]
;W[gf];B[ge];W[hf];B[kh];W[if];B[kj];W[ij];B[jj];W[lk];B[mi]
C[UR: Again the top side];W[cb];B[db];W[qb];B[pb];W[rb]C[UR: White has secured points in both corners now]
;B[kb]C[UR: very good move!];W[jb];B[cc];W[bb];B[hm];W[hl];B[gm]
;W[gl];B[fn];W[hs];B[is];W[gs];B[jr];W[lm];B[ln];W[ll];B[ep]

;W[jd]
(;B[kf]C[UR: This move doesn't secure any points];W[gp]
(;B[gq]C[UR: It's not easy to see the upcoming ko];W[fo];B[eo]
;W[gn]
(;B[hn]C[UR: At this points you should sacrifice the two stones at G-H 7 instead.

I'll stop the review here, since the rest of the game is just this ko fight and smaller endgame moves.

[dr][fr][sr][as][bs][cs][ds][es][ss]C[UR: You played very well and only a few mistakes decided this game.

In generell you need to attack more. You tend to defend blindly and allow your opponent to live easily.
Don't protect too fast, especially if someone invades your territory.
First think about the thread and then try to attack instead of protecting.
Don't fear the fights, its the only way to learn.

And if you need to protect try to find a move that accomplishes more then just protecting.]
