;B[pc]C[Hello,

This game was played on IGS. I have played only a few games online. When I started, I ranked myself as 15k, but I got decimated, so I lowered my rank down to 25k. I haven't played the required amount of games to make this official though. This game was against a 27k. Somehow, I really doubt the rankings are accurate since 30k is absolute beginner...

I have read some books about Go basics. I think I've reached a point where I need to record and review my games in order to continue advancing.

Hopefully, I can reach 15k soon and start reviewing games on the Go Teaching Ladder as well.

Thanks in advance for helping me improve :)

P.S. I am familiar with only a few japanese/korean words, if possible, could you state the words and their meaning when you see the situation on the board.

Hi,

This is my first review for the GTL. I will do my best but since I am only 12k I will probably make mistakes. So please do not take everything I say as the absolute truth.

It is a good idea to play games and review them to improve because then you can see what you do wrong and do it right next time.]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ep]LB[eq:A]C[Black's invasion here surprised me. I didn't really know how to respond to this (I only know a few joseki). I was thinking that this would have been an easily enclosed corner.

Don't worry about the fact that you don't know many joseki. At your strength you don't need them because you only improve by learning joseki if you know how to use them. If you just play moves because it's joseki, you get only weaker.

You can easily enclose the corner with A. See variation.]
(;W[cn];B[cq];W[ce]C[Since I didn't know how to take care of the lower corner, I decided to attack him instead.]
;B[ed]
(;W[de]LB[dh:B][bc:A]C[It's better to make some eye space by playing in the corner at A or extend along the side to B.]
;B[pj];W[qn];B[or];W[pr]C[This prevents him from entering the corner. Was there a better way to play here?

I would have played the same way. You get a nice corner.];B[oq]
;W[pq];B[lq];W[gp];B[cl]
(;W[en]LB[fo:B][eo:A]C[I think A is better because now you have a weak point at B where black can easily cut.]

(;B[ci]
(;W[jq]LB[eq:B][fo:A]C[Since black's left side group has a base now it's pretty safe and the cut at A is dangerous. I think it's best to attack the black stones in the lower left with B but the situation is complicated.]
;B[gc];W[jd];B[pe];W[mc]C[Good move. You create eye space for your stone and black can't extend in that direction from his shimari (two stone corner enclosure) anymore.]
;B[di]LB[bc:A]TR[de][ce]C[A is really important now. Your triangled stones become weaker with every move black makes in that area. A would give them eye space and take away the corner from black.]
;W[ph]C[Ok, I think the opening phase is done.

I have a lot of difficulty understanding what makes a move "big" during the middle game. Could you please point out some possible big moves for both sides as the game progresses?

A move is big when it takes a lot of territory.
However the biggest move is not always the best. Moves that make eyes, connect, separate or create thickness are also good. In the endgame, when territories are almost comleted, the size of a move very important and then you should search the board for the biggest move.]
;B[fp];W[fo]C[I realised while reviewing that this wasn't such a good move...

Why do you think the move wasn't good and where do you think you should have played? I think it's good to ask yourself those questions. Black can cut anyway. This move doesn't seem that bad to me.]
;B[go];W[hp]C[I didn't want to lose the potential territory at the bottom.

It's a fine move.];B[eo];W[fn];B[gq];W[do];B[dp];W[hq];B[fq]

(;W[gr]LB[hn:A]TR[go]C[Small move. Connecting by capturing the marked stone with A is urgent.]
;B[fr]
(;W[gs]TR[gr]C[See previous comment. If black captures the tiangled stone it's gote and he would only take a few points so it would be no big deal.]

(;B[pl]C[Black should split you now. See variation.];W[ql];B[oi]
;W[oh];B[nk];W[hc];B[bc]TR[de][ce]C[This is a good move, it defends the corner and attacks the triangled stones.]

(;W[cd]LB[bd:A]C[Empty triangles are bad shape and if you don't have to make one it's usually better to avoid them. A for example. It starts to make eyes at the side.]

;B[br];W[ob]LB[hn:B][fe:A]C[This move is big but A and B are  very urgent and should be played first.]

(;W[kl]C[I realised after I played this that it was a vulgar move, since it potentially helps black secure territory in the middle.

It is inevitable that black will get some territory in the middle but I think this is a good move to keep that amount under control. See variation.]

(;W[ch]LB[pa:A]C[Small move. Doesn't reduce or enlarge much. A is big because it's double sente. See variations. After both variations it's black's move. The only difference is that if white plays first black's territory is reduced and if black plays there first white's is reduced, so whoever plays there first gets something for nothing.]

Yes it was.

You had many weak groups in this game and were lucky black didn't capture anyone of them.
Often it is better to make sure your groups can make eyes if they are attacked then to think about that
when the attack starts. I think you can improve a lot by seeing which groups are weak and need help.]
