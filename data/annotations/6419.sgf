GC[Game submitted through GTL, reviewed by Raymond Wold.]

AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hi, I am Raymond Wold reviewing this game, AKA W, or Woldsom on KGS. I hope this review is helpful, and am open to any questions you might have.]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[fp]
(;B[dn]LB[dn:A][co:B];W[nq]
(;B[oq]LB[lq:B][oq:A];W[np];B[pn]C[This seems like very passive play. Yes, in a normal game, this would be useful for black, but in a handicap game, a slightly different play style is prefered. Either use the handicap stones to always attack, forcing white to live small everywhere (can be very scary when playing someone so much stronger) or play solid, slightly slow moves that can't be made useless by clever play, being careful to parsel out the advantage throughout the game so you are still leading when it's over.

This fuseki leaves the 3-3 points open (white can at any point play C3 or R3 and gain), which can exploit later in the game. I've outlined some alternatives I feel might better suit the strength difference in the game tree.]
;W[hp];B[lp];W[nn];B[jm];W[ql]
(;B[qj]LB[qj:A][qn:B]C[R8 is a strong attack on your corner, putting all your stones there in jeopardy; here a solid move from the outside is very risky. R6 would be my choice, securing the corner and becomming solid in preparation for splitting white's surrounding stones,.]
;W[qo];B[po];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm]C[You practically have to cut here. Handicap stones are tremendous influence, and any attack which doesn't cost you a lot if it fails should be tried, and are likely to be successful.]

(;B[qg]LB[qg:A][om:B];W[nl];B[hq]C[Much too close, make sure your stones are connected. J3  or E2 here to cancel any chance of a white base.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[hr]
(;B[jq]LB[ho:B][jq:A]C[This sequence is only really useful if you block white from the center. If A was your planned move, play it without J4, or even without H3]
;W[gq];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp]C[Small endgame gote move. Gains you nothing at this stage. If you're worried about corner life, play a shape move, like Q2 or R2, which won't in the process solidify your opponent.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[dl];B[cg]C[Again you leave your corner group very vulnerable.]
;W[co];B[cp]
(;W[bm];B[cn]C[Seems like white made a mistake here.];W[fl]
;B[gn];W[fj]
(;B[ei]TR[ek]SQ[fj][dl][fl]C[This shape (square marked) should always be recognized as weak. The triangle marked cutting point is the achilles heel. A move like E11 then is quite counterproductive, as you can see that you are creating a weak spot for yourself at E10.]
;W[fi]
(;B[cj]C[Imagine if this was the stone played first here, would you then answer F11 with E11? This move makes E11 even more useless, as you are no longer cutting white off from crawling further.]
;W[eh];B[dh];W[eg];B[fd];W[cd];B[ce];W[dc];B[cc];W[bd]
(;B[ec]LB[ec:A][be:B]C[The more common move is to press once more.]
;W[de];B[df];W[ed];B[ee];W[dd]
(;B[fe]LB[fe:A][ef:B]C[D14 is the heavier group, and the one you should try to connect out with.]
;W[fc];B[gc];W[eb];B[jg]C[I'd favor connecting at E14. Solid and slow wins handicap games.]
;W[ef]C[Cut at once here.]

;B[qe];W[od];B[rd];W[pe];B[qd]C[This is well played (from M17 to here). White gained very little here, and you became solid.]
;W[gb];B[hc];W[he]

;W[dg];B[cf];W[ch];B[bh];W[di];B[ci];W[ej];B[qb];W[ob];B[nj]
C[This is tenuki for the situation at the left, which is much bigger.]
;W[bk];B[bj];W[af];B[ag];W[ae]
(;B[oe]C[The left hand side is VERY complicated; I would suggest that unless you've read it out to the end, that you try to play (just making sure you don't die in gote.) It's at least 30 points if you die, the clearly biggest play on the board. See variations in the game tree.]

;W[dh]C[This is what wins the game. White kills you, and at the same time secures his last weak group. You might have a few points lead here in an even game, but in a handicap game, it's game over.]

;W[hg];B[hh];W[gf];B[ge];W[hf]
(;B[hb]C[You're letting white connect in sente. Even if the cut don't work, it forces white to add a move here.]
