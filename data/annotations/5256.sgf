C[Hello Peter! My comments will be marked as [GTL\]

This game was notable for me for 2 things
a) an attempt at a double pincer on a 4,4 stone ( Move 12 )
b) an successful attempt at an invasion / reduction ( Move 74 )
Though I am still unsure whether the reduction was played correctly..the proble being that 1 space extensions can be cut and dealing with the consequences of a cut, or realizing that board position is changing such that the extension needs filling is my missing link]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq]
(;B[jd]C[[GTL\] I dont like this move for Black. The main purpose of the san-ren-sei fuseki (those 3 Black stones at the star points) is to make a moyo, a big framework. See the variation at move 6]

(;W[cj];B[fc];W[df];B[jp];W[qn]C[the first time i have tried this

[GLT\] This is OK for White. Still could be better if played earlier.]
;B[np];W[qq]C[and not clear what the joseki is that follows the pincer]
;B[oq];W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[nr]C[[GTL\] The result is OK for you. Black played in the wrong direction at P3. As you can see he's too overconcentrated here. He spent 3 moves to kill and to remove some bad aji from that white stone. And he should've atari at N3.]
;W[hq]C[aiming at sliding to K2 later, taking advantage of the K4 stone not being at K3

[GTL\] This is dangerous. Its too close of Black strong group. Yes, you can slide to K3, but now its b's turn, he can play at F3. Playing at G3 is good.]

(;B[db];W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[fe];W[qf]C[[GTL\] Good];B[qe];W[pf]
;B[nd];W[qi];B[qj];W[pi];B[ni];W[dn]TR[hq]C[I wanted to try and keep my groups to as few as possible and thought this solidified the side

[GTL\] Now you can see that the triangled stone is in a bad place. You should play eficiently. This means secure more territory playing less moves.]
;B[cq];W[cp]C[[GTL\] Nice choice. Some players play in the wrong side when the san-san invasion arises.]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[dq];W[eq];B[er]C[[GTL\] There is this tesuji if you want to secure the corner. (play at B). Black has 2 choices: capture the F2 stone and give the corner to you, or just connect at D2 and live small in the corner.]

(;W[fq];B[fr];W[bq];B[br];W[ap];B[gq];W[gp];B[gr]C[theoutcome was that i had built a wall and was now thinking of trying to turn into territory with, say, F13]

(;W[fp];B[hr];W[ho];B[iq];W[hp]C[[GTL\] This is small. You should tenuki (E10 for example)]
;B[ip]C[[GTL\] Well, he just gave you sente]
(;W[ql]C[trying to extend my space and put pressure on R10 group

[GTL\] This is slow. The corner is pretty safe now. You should attack R10 with a hane at P10. See prev. variation.]
;B[pq]C[Another move he just gave to you {2}];W[pr];B[mq]C[Another {3}]
;W[ej]C[i thought this an important point, as B playing there would severely reduce W

[GTL\] Good];B[fh];W[dh];B[nf];W[ol]C[[GTL\] You can do better here.]
;B[se]C[was worried about this, i saw it as a severe attack on my group.

You can kill R10 now];W[sg]C[was there a better response?

this is ok. There is S14 too.];B[rf];W[rg];B[oj];W[rj];B[oh]
;W[qk]C[so i looked to join my groups, now i had just the two. But I felt that W was behind so i was planning an invasion or reduction around M17 or L15

[GTL\] Black is ahead. I think its about 10 to 15 points. You have more solid territory than black, so now you just need to reduce black's moyo.]
;B[of]C[Another {4}];W[lc]TR[lh][kh][jh][ih][hh]C[Given that B stones on the fourth line, I thought an invasion might be worth a try

[GTL\] This is an overplay. Its impossible to live there. You need good timing to invade a framework. And of course this is not the moment. When you invade, you MUST check all the groups (from both players). You need to connect to some living group or try to live inside. Here, you cant do anything.

You are completly surrounded. If you find a group that you want to reduce you should imagine this line in your head. If you go too deep you cant escape]
;B[mc];W[ld];B[jc];W[lf]C[but then turned it into a reduction. When i have tried these things before I have changed my mind in mid escape sequence, gone after another tempting target, and lost the lot. Here I was determinred to run for safety and only respond to severe sente moves. Working on the principle that the M line of stones was reducing B on a large scale.

{GTL\] Still impossible to escape or live];B[ke];W[le]
(;B[kf];W[lh]C[[GTL\] I think you didnt see that black can cut at M13 and kill your stick]
;B[jh];W[ki]C[I also wanted to keep the connection along the escape route solid, hence L11 as opposed to a weaker M10]
;B[gj];W[fl]C[i thought this deserved playing here as
a) worked with  line 4 stones for territory
b) worked to cement territory along C10 area
c) was a step towards running stones

BUT  if he had responded now with L9 I could perhaps have been in trouble.

Should i just have kept running and played L9?

[GTL\] Yes. 86 is a bad move now. Its too slow.You have more urgent moves on the board, so you should secure then first. M13 is still open]
;B[mk];W[kk]C[so , i played L9 now.  In all these 1 space runs, I worry about the line-breaking move, eg L10]
;B[ij];W[jm]C[Here i considered K8 as being more solid, but felt that K7 was nearly in touch with home base]
;B[hl];W[in]C[Safety!!  Now I could also think of expanding away from the reduction spine and causing more damage. But i was concious of a hole at G7 and that the area around N6 was still potentially available

[GTL\] Actually black is too way ahead now, but he didnt played M13.]

(;B[kn];W[km];B[ln];W[nn];B[on];W[om]C[unsure of this but i was wary of B Q7 if i had played at O7]

;W[pn];B[no];W[oo];B[op];W[lb]C[Looking for a monkey jump either way, and reducing B by ~8 points]

;B[gb];W[ga];B[fb];W[fa];B[ea];W[ib];B[ic]C[gaining about 12 points]
;W[sf]C[Wrong? The R13 cut is dangerous

[GTL\] Yes, you just lose sente.

My comments ends here. I wouldn't say that you played really well because black didn't know how to hande the san-ren-sei fuseki and all those moves he just gave to you for free (and of course, the M13 gap). But you've made good moves too.

You should be more careful when you invade, needs good timing. You cant play expecting your opponent to make a mistake, its not cool. Just try to invade earlier, not when the group is surrounded everywhere.

This is the only thing i advice you to do. The other mistakes are natural (joseki, good shapes and some tesuji) since you're still a low kyu player. You will fix these problems naturally, by just playing.

i think its more interesting for you and for us (GTL) to send a game that you lost, a game that you read really hard and still didnt find a good continuation. 
Of course, its not cool to lose a game, but i really want to help you more and other players to fix their problems/mistakes. If you win a game, it's obvious that you won because you made less mistakes than your opponent. And thats what we (reviewers) want to see in the games that come to us. More mistakes, more advices. I'm sorry, my english is not that good. Thank You]
