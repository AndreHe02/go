AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[So I played black in this handicap game against a much stronger opponent. Though I realize handicap games might be harder to review, this was the first game in a while that I've lost without commiting a mistake too embarassing to send in for review. My main resource for studying go is other people's reviews on GTL, it has served me well so far though having only read reviews from player strengths 10-18k, often a stronger player's tesuji's catch me off guard >.< I've been on a climb lately and this was my first game as a 7k on KGS. I provide my own analysis and some strategic questions i've been wondering about, any additional suggestions would be welcome as well. Being a handicap game, I'm sure my opponent took some calaculated risks as well and advice on how to pick at his weaknesses would be appreciated too. Thank you for taking time to review my game :)]
;W[fc]C[Comments prefaced by "Gus:"];B[cc]C[This is a handicap strategy I'm testing out...  immediately protecting the corner. my interpretation is that it is a very strong arm move if he approaches the left side I can split him, it in a way sets up a base for myself and immediately allows me to attack (I feel like).

Gus: Not a good strategy. your stones are too close, and your move has only one meaning. Think of it this way. If you had a stone at c17 and w played f17 would you play d16? (I hope not ;)). D15 or d14 would be much more attractive. It doesn't matter which order you put the stones down in. If you wind up with a slow formation, you wind up with a slow formation either way :)]
;W[nc];B[qc]C[is some kind of pincer here a better idea?];W[jd]
LB[jc:B][lc:A][ne:C]C[i have difficulty against this kind of shape (spacey low high low on the sides), yet it shows up in alot of my games. from the spacing (big keimas?) I get the impression that it is imperfect and reducable, but all my attempts tend to get shot down, and I end up in trouble

Gus: it's a thin shape that w will need to fix at least twice. No need to do anything just now. A B and C are all possible points later.]
(;B[dj]C[D13/14 instead? I thought I could attack properly if he played C/D 13/14 but it seems my upper left got into trouble.]
;W[np];B[qn]LB[oq:A]C[abandoning the 3,3 strategy since its a high approach, and i dont have to worry about that 3,3 invasion joseki. at least i think i dont...

Gus: Yes you do. it takes 2 moves to secure a 4-4 corner. You are not secure until you get a stone at A, and if b has a stone at o3, you you have to ad yet another stone. 4-4 points are terrible for controling territory in the corner. You should use them for influence and attack, not taking territory.]
;W[fp];B[cn];W[jp]LB[hq:C][jq:B][lq:A]C[i know sometimes people will say "too flat", is there such a thing as too high?

Gus: Sure, this can be invaded easily at any of the marked points.

Also, if you attach underneath w becomes over concentrated]

This is ok W is thin on top, and isolated on the left C17 was slow, but at least you are using it effectively.]
;W[fg];B[ge];W[hd];B[eh]C[idk if my thought process on using peeps is a little off. make him heavy, and give D10 a little support? or am i imagining the support part... i didnt want him wrapping around and putting d10 in trouble.

Gus: This is ok. Proverb: A straight line has no shape

Note that if d16 were not there, this would be bad because it strengthens w and would activate a wedge.]
;W[eg]
(;B[hg];W[gh];B[fj]C[not sure im actually benefitting from this attack sequence... neither side of my black stones is making territory, the left side still open from the bottom, but at the time i couldnt think of any good offensive/sente moves... white seems solid everywhere else.

Gus: Exactly That's why we take away the base first. That's where the profit is]
;W[hh]
(;B[or]C[his bottom is open, so... go under the skirt and protect/take the corner at the same time?

Gus: Soft. attach at o3 and you get more profit];W[nr];B[oq]
;W[nq];B[cg]C[i figure. whichever way he blocks i can attach this stone to one of my two groups. i dont like it when an opponent's group moves down and threatens two skirts/monkeyjumps at the same time so this was sort of pre-emptive. seemed sente enough too.

Gus: Your comment reveals exactly why you shouldn't have played it... NEVER play on the idea that you can "try something" Play a move because you know you do exactly X. If you don't know the result, or the benefit, you are inviting disaster.

Your top left group should be fine nomatter what you do in this area]

(;W[qn]C[though i never stood a chance in this one.... my opponent has way too many threats available.

one thing i've been wondering about ko fights though. wouldn't it be benefitial for white to continue this fight until he uses up his big threats? so that black gets a cheaper trade for the ko?

like hypothetically if winning the ko is valued at 5.

white has threats : 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
black has threats : 1, 1, 1, 3, 7

should white continue the fight after black plays the threat of 3, play threat valued at 6, then let black have his threat of 1? even though just taking the ko at that point is already a win.

Gus: In theory if you can be sure that the next threat you make will be responded to, and your opponent's next threat is signifcantly less then ok, but in this case the ko is worth about 30 points. Your next two threats are equal or bigger than this one...]
