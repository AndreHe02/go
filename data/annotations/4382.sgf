C[Hello, sorry abt the delay, 4th of july put me back a bit. I will do the best that I can!]

C[I think that this move is too slow and territorial. A move in the area of c6 would be better. It would put pressure on the weak black stone and allow you to develop left side. It is also the most open side of the board.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[dd];W[dc];B[fd];W[ed];B[ee];W[ec];B[gd];W[cg]
C[h12 would have been better?

I still like c6 area. The c4 stone is quite weak. Also, an attack would help you build influence to attack the e15 stones more effectively]
;B[gc];W[gb];B[hb];W[ha]C[1st big mistake - i Knnow :-(
yeah, h19 doesnt work. Has to be at f18 or 19.];B[fb];W[hc]
;B[ga];W[ib]C[try to get a new start at the other side

I think this is too heavy. I think that a play at h16 setting up a table or bamboo joint and sacrificing h19 would be better. jumping to n17 might work as well.]
;B[hd];W[ic];B[ia]C[really bad shape, d17 group and j17 group both dumpling shaped and without a lot of growth potential]
;W[ja]C[too heavy, when you are being attacked like this you ned to play lighter. You are going to lose some stones, but try to get something out of it.maybe still n17 here]
;B[kb];W[qc]C[give up an try the 3-3 invasion in the corner, maybe it will grow to rescue the lost stones  around j/k 17/18

not gonna happen. a 3,3 invasion takes territory in exchange for influence. black will never give you that much territory. I know that blacks corner looks huge, but the few points you take away wont be enough if you give him a wall that works well with the h16 an r4 groups. i still say b6 or c6 here]

;W[qg];B[pg]
(;W[qh]C[i wonder if q14 would work here];B[qj];W[qi]C[way too slow. c4 is still weak and you dont get much of anything from this. cut or run]

;B[fn];W[gm];B[gn];W[io];B[ho];W[in]C[prison black in the corner, try to make a connection to O3, get Influence and expand starting in the center (no chance in the left corner)]

;B[qr];W[lp]C[i say cut at e6. its going to be a capturing race, and i can't read it out, but its the best shot you have. This move is too small]
;B[lo];W[kp]C[unnessary, w is connected. d8 would have been better, or e6]
;B[dl];W[ek];B[dj];W[dk];B[ck];W[eh];B[dg];W[dh];B[eg];W[fi]
C[connect in case the stones at E8 and F7 won't get to life

e8 is ok for now, not in any danger.
c10 is big, p4 might be fun because of b's cutting points, q14 might be fun, k14 try to make some room for life. this move doesnt do enough]
;B[gh];W[ii];B[ih];W[ki];B[kh];W[mj]C[try to make at least some territory

not here with m6,  black has l7 and is protected against n5 cut by ladder]

be careful with these 2nd line cutting points, they are harsh]

[bd][bc][bb][ba][ag][af][ae][ad][ac][ab][aa]C[OK, so final impressions. You are way too easy on black. Black leaves a lot of weaknesses and you let him get away with a lot. The c4 stone was weak for half the game. The cutting point at r15 could have saved you a lot. Connecting and trying to capture at e6 wouldnty have cost you anything really. I think you ahve the right idea, but like me a lot of the time, you are too lenient. Also, you ned to learn when to sacrifice, The stones in the beginning were gone, and you let your play get heavy to try to save them. 2 stones iks al ot less of a loss then saving them with really bad shape. Try to keep your play lighter, read a few shape articles like the ones at gobase.org. The jokeki you misplayed can be found at
http://senseis.xmp.net/?33PointInvasion
You are doing fine, and with tiome and experience your play will become more confident. Dont be afraid to take a risk and attack a weak point. Finally, every move ask yourself: Is there somewhere i need to defend? Is there a weak point i need to attack? What is the biggest move? In that order. I hope that this has been helpful. Keep up the good work and I am sure you will become strong. ~Erithid]
