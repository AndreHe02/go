C[I want to know if I make important mistakes in my fuseki.

Thank you in advance to the person who help me to progress.

The real game is from the stone 1 to the stone 81, after I wrote
sequences I remembered but its not the real game.

Julien


Alex: hey Julien,

i am Alex and i play as 6 kyu on kgs. i am a bit confused in regard to the side for which to review. Here it seems to me that you played as black, the email i got from gtl said i should review for white. 
Nevertheless i will try to make a proper and sound comment on the fuseki of both sides. Where did you get your 11 kyu grade? you play much better than a 11 kyu on kgs.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp]
(;B[cn];W[dn]C[A: In my view it is a mistake for white to choose here this joseki. because it aims at influence towards the center and the right side. but the lower right side is occupied by black. so the developing influece is somewhat offset by the black stone at Q4
see the variation i made for black approaching from the other side (move 5).]
;B[dm];W[co];B[en];W[do];B[cm]
(;W[gq]C[A: this moves does not secure the corner as you will see later when black invades at C3. Black can live easily in the corner. see the variation for the proper joseki move.]
(;B[di]C[A: I think D11 is the right extension];W[cf]C[A: low is good
but bigger points K17; R 10 or corner approach];B[qk];W[nc]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[jq];W[ec]
(;B[cq]C[A: D3 would have been better (see variation). But the timing of the invasion was right after you estabilished K3.]

;W[br];B[cr];W[bq];B[gp];W[gr];B[bo];W[cp];B[ip]
(;W[qp]C[A: i think the invasion comes to early. black gets a strong wall facing the K3 group and black single stones Q4 and R4 become connected with the group around K3.
it would have been better for white to try to seperate blacks groups. between Q4 and R9 is a wide gap and between Q4 and the group around K3, too. Also the group K3 is not securly connected with D7. 
Strategical it is correct for white to play in the lower right corner to prevent it become consolidated black territory. But the tactic should be seperating and running, because otherwise black gets too much strength out of it.]

;W[fo];B[go];W[fn];B[gn];W[fm];B[gm];W[ek];B[dk];W[fl];B[hk]
C[A: the right move for black here to protect his huge sphere of influence. the group around C9 is not realy threatend.]

i did not see a fuseki mistake if you play as black. for white i pointed out some fuseki mistakes. i am sorry that i couldn't help you more. If you have some questions regarding the game or my comments please feel free to ask me.
