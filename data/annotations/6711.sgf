--------------------------------
Review made by Pavel Jel√≠nek (Prague, Czech republic) in July 2008
Email: pjel@centrum.cz];W[jp];B[pj];W[jd];B[dj]C[I'm wondering if my last 2 moves were smart. They seem good, but most games I see don't go that way.
-----------------------------

Pavel: They were good. 
(My personal habit is to play moves like R13 to strengten the corner. Some players object to this that this way I avoid fighting and have less use of the game.)]
;W[jj];B[hc];W[jc];B[ib]C[Pavel: J18 forces W to strenghten so exchange B J18 W K18 brings 
more to white - therefore it is a wrong black move. I would try M17]
;W[jb];B[lc]C[I tryed to overwhelm my opponents position by taking him on on 2 sides, but I don't think it went quite well. Should I have just stayed on one side, or just tenuki?
----------------------------------
Pavel: I prefer N17. 

White group is certainly not weak (= it is not possible to gain advantage by atacking it - http://senseis.xmp.net/?Attack). Weak groups are a difficult concept but very important to grasp at some point.

As it is not weak, M17 has no advantages compared with a safer move N17. 
But the problems that followed were mostly caused by later mistakes - I pointed some wrong moves.]
;W[mc]LB[ld:A][md:B]C[I prefer N16. The black stone at M17 can be very useful even if you do not try to save it. See variant B.]

(;B[ld];W[lb];B[md];W[nc]LB[nd:B][od:A]C[Pavel: Next black move is a big mistake.
 Black O16 is much better because B stays connected (see variant B)]

(;B[od];W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[mf];W[le];B[ng]C[Pavel: P14 prevents a cut at P15, which is not dangerous now but could be later, if there are white stones somehere around S17

(Actuallty, now I see that W soon explited the cut)];W[lf]LB[lg:B]
[ni:A]C[Pavel: M13 is much better, see the variant]
(;B[ni];W[qf];B[qg]C[Pavel: Now black should play P15 or so; he would save stones P+Q16 and probably kill white stone R14]
;W[oe];B[nf];W[pe]LB[pf:B][jm:A]C[Pavel: If I count right, Black Q14 would save all black stones]

(;B[jm]C[I kinda panicked about that upper right corner. I knew I pretty much lost that battle. So I tenuki-d and tryed to divert his attention elsewhere...

----------------------------------------
Pavel: The battle became lost by this black move (tenuki), not earlier. 

And as for a suitable move to tenuky, I would prefer R3, C13 or so.
(Chinese proverb: Corner is gold, Edge is silver, center is grass)

It is generally good to cut white stones from each other but in this case it brings little use because each of them can make life on its own.]
;W[qd]C[...and it obviously didn't work.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Pavel: When fighting about something, you can tenuki (abadon this local fight) if:

1. either you are convinced that you win the local fight EVEN IF you give an extra move to the opponent (by your tenuki) -  (see http://senseis.xmp.net/?Status)

2. or you are sure that the opponent MUST answer your tenuki (that you can punish him very much if he uses your tenuki to win the local fight).

3. Or you are convinced that further play in the local fight would not save the fight. 

You probably did it for reason 3, but if you are not sure (that the local fight is lost), it is better to continue.

Before you tenukied the fight was lost for W. W now played correctly and exploited your mistake (tenuki) and killed your 2 stones to save his own stones.]
;B[pc]C[Pavel: It is wrong to try to save what has no chance to be saved. 

I would strongly recommend solving goproblems, for example www.goproblems.com]

;W[rg];B[rh];W[sg];B[sf];W[re];B[sh];W[mg];B[nh];W[mh];B[rg]
C[Pavel: S13 brings you nothing. If you played N11 or C13 instead, you would gain something.]
;W[mi];B[pi]C[Pavel: Q11 also gains nothing. If white plays Q12, black is in no danger]
;W[nj];B[oj]C[P 10 gains much less than moves like R7 or C13]
;W[nk]LB[mj:B][pm:A]C[I think black cut at N10 has a chance to avoid caputre and if it does, it leaves stones O9-10 weak. (Master Kageyama says: If yo can cut, then cut).]

(;B[pm];W[qq]C[My opponents seem to play there alot, but I can never find a proper defense to it.
---------------------------
Pavel: I spent years in belief that I play badly if I cannot capture this stone. But is it not so. This stone cannot be captured. The corner enclosures that prevent an invasion  (= allow you to capture the invading stone) are:

C6-D4-E3 (but this takes too little territory)
C4-D4-G3 (efficient with C8) - of course the presence of hostile stones (for example at J3) changes the situation an the enclosure  is then not invasion-proof
C7-C3-D4-G3
C3-D4 (very inefficient)
C3 alone (it is not the ideal opening for a beginner like you or me)
C4-E3

Before this invasion, you had three unprotected corners, each requiring at least 2 moves to secure. Now you can see why I often adviced to play R7 or C13.  It would be a brick in creation an invasion-proof corner enclosure.

There are many reasons why invasions early in the game are wrong (disadvantegous), the main one is that white would allow you to make a strong  wall (a by-product of invasion) around white stones and such wall is especially efficient on an almost-empty board. So it is logical that W did not invade early.

You had many oportunities to secure your corners. You chose to do something else in these moments - this would not have been neccessarily bad, if you gained much by this. But I pointed your moves which gained little - these should have been used for example for corner enclosure.

See also: 
 http://senseis.xmp.net/?Enclosure
 http://senseis.xmp.net/?InvadingAnEnclosure];B[pq]C[Pavel: Good - a good way to prevent further spreading (this is what you should do if you realize that you cannot kill white)]
;W[qp];B[qo]LB[po:B][ro:A]C[Pavel: This is the right move, but I will mention that it would be very wrong if there were white stones instead of 3 black stones at P-Q 10-11. 

White can cut at Q5 and his cutting stone will survive. If there were white stones as I mentioned, then the black stones R5 and Q7 would probably be captured.

See variant B]
(;W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[rm]C[Pavel: Very good];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]
;B[ps]LB[oq:B][qs:A]C[Pavel: In such cases, black should prevent the cut t B, because this cut often ends by capturing P2 and white canextend to the left (as in variation W P3 B O3)

In this case black can prevent this capture but white still builds a strong chain of stones - see variation W P3 B P4)

If you had played O3 now, you would be spared many problems (like getting stones around P2 captured).]

(;W[qs];B[os];W[oq];B[nr]C[Pavel: 

Now it is too late to save P2 stones, but group Q4 is safe.

B O2 is not useful, it helps white.

Instead of O2, black should tenuki (for example C13, later D17 - this together with H17 produces the safe formation as I mentiones)

If black plays B P4 ... B O4 to gain influence or territory near O6, he will gain very little. (But generally it is a good technique: you can put P4 and O4 for free - in sente - so you should do it if you gain something by it.)

If black plays O3, then O4, then N2 to save your P1 group, he will not succeed.]
;W[po];B[op];W[nq];B[mq]C[Pavel: Again, black helps white to become stronger. 
Ask yourself: what was the goal (purpose) of this move?];W[np]
;B[oo];W[mr]C[Which group in the lower right should I have saved?
-------------------------------
Pavel: It was wrong to try to save P1. You made moves to save Q4 group only when this group was in danger (which happened after W Q5) and this was rigth.]
;B[mm]LB[km:B][no:A]C[Pavel: I think refinforcing a corner would be a better choice for black.

By this move stenghtens the lonely black stone, but not very much - I think white still can cut it off (see variant B)]

(;W[no];B[pn];W[mp]LB[mj:B][on:A]C[Pavel: Now black should properly read if cut at N10 works (because if the cutting stone survives, the resulting situation is advantageous for black) and eventually cut.

I am convinced that the cut works and captures O9 groups - see variant.]

(;B[on]C[Pavel: This move achieves almost nothing compared with strenghtening the corner. 

If black worried of W P6, thinking that W will connect O5 with O9, then I must say:
- white will not connect after W P6 BQ5 etc..
- connecting would not help White because O4 group lives. If white is afraid of the cut at N10 works, he  has easier methods to save O9 than connecting to O6

As I said 1 move earlier, I think the cut B N10 works. If Black will not cut, he should strenghten the corner instead of this move.]
;W[lq];B[nm]C[Pavel: The same mistake. Later, when W invades your corner, you will ask yourself where you made a mistake - this move is a good example.]
;W[gq];B[fq]C[Pavel: I prefer E3. Altough F3 is not an attack, the rule http://senseis.xmp.net/?DontAttachWhenAttacking still applies.]
;W[cq];B[dq]C[Pavel: B C4 would let W less space to extend.]
;W[cp];B[cr]C[I tryed to back him away from the corner with this move.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pavel: back away? You mean deny the corner to white, because corner gives much eyespace? No - white is easily alive after D5. 

I would certainly play Black C5 to let W less space.];W[br]
;B[cs]C[Pavel: B C5 would bring you much more.];W[bs];B[er]
;W[co];B[do];W[dn];B[en];W[dm];B[el];W[em];B[fm]LB[dl:A][fn:B]
C[Pavel: Move B E8 was right if (and only if) the white cut at B (=F6) will not work o capture the black stones C1 to E6. 

If W tries this, then the question is whether B can make two eyes.

I think that this time the W cut will not work (see variant B) so your moves were right. 

A one-step jump like E8 is a very good strategy in this kind of "fighting about which line the opponent will get to ".]

(;W[dl];B[dk]C[Pavel: Should be at D9];W[fn];B[eo];W[fl];B[gm]
;W[ek];B[go]C[Pavel: Good. (But securing the corner gives black more)]
;W[gl];B[hm];W[gr]LB[dc:B][fr:A]
(;B[fr]C[Pavel: Empty triangle is mostly a very inefficient shape. (http://senseis.xmp.net/?TheEmptyTriangleIsBad)

B F4 would give your group three eyes = obviously alive. 
But even better, B should not respond to the white move if B realizes that his group would still be alive.

In this case it will be alive, and so instead of strenghtening a living group, black should tenuki (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tenuki)  for example at D17, C13 etc.

I added a variant showing that B would still be alive.];W[cc]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec]C[Pavel: Good];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb]C[Pavel: Good]
;W[bd]LB[be:B][cf:A]
(;B[cf]C[Pavel: Good! Ater B B15 there is a dangerous white cut which is difficult (at least for me) to tell how it would end. Maybe you would lose stones E17 to J18. You chose the right thing - not to risk the cut if you cannot calculate its result. 

The harm made by a successfull cut is usually much bigger that the harm to the cutting player after an unsuccessful cut  (especially if the cutting player notices in time that his cut failed and does not continue). Therefore I think you should mostly cut when you are not able to calculate the outcome (for example at N10 earlier in the game). And for the same reason, it was wise here to not to risk the cut.

Of course, practicing in reading (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Reading) is very important - then you will fortell the result of most cuts and choose the right play (to protect or not to protect...).]
;W[bf];B[be];W[ae];B[ce];W[ac];B[bg];W[af];B[ch];W[ad]LB[bb:B]
[bj:A]C[Pavel: Black B18 might do much harm to W (it is a bit "advanced trick")]

(;B[bj]C[Pavel: I prefer C8];W[bl];B[ag];W[bb];B[gg]C[I played here to try and have some influence over that large empty space there.
------------------------
Pavel: I was thinking to make the same move (to secure territory). It is often wrong to try to make territory in the centre (http://senseis.xmp.net/?ThereIsNoTerritoryInTheCenter) and I am too weak in discerning it.

But I would probably do exactly this, so I think your move was very good.]
;W[gf]LB[ff:A][hf:B]
(;B[ff]C[Pavel: if H14 works, it is much better than F14. If it does not, it is much worse.

But I am convinced that it works (see variant)];W[ge];B[fe]
;W[gd];B[gc];W[hg];B[gh];W[hh];B[fi]C[Pavel: I prefer G11,]
;W[hi];B[gi];W[hj]LB[mj:B][gp:A]
(;B[gp]C[Pavel: This move brings black almost nothing.

I would cut at N10 (see variant)

it is the endgame, the status (life) of groups has been solved and your task is to reduce the opponent territory and prevent him to reduce yours.

Some other moves: M9, T6, H4, M5, A9];W[hp];B[hn]C[Pavel: This moves also brings very little]
;W[io];B[km]C[Pavel: A bigger reduction of W territory would be better, such as M9.

If B intended to connect, I must say that there is no use in connecting two groups if they are both easily  alive]
;W[ln];B[lm];W[kn];B[jn]C[Pavel: Good, but M9 etc. is stronger.]
;W[jo];B[il];W[hk];B[gs]C[Pavel: Good];W[hr];B[hs];W[is];B[fs]
;W[iq];B[rk]C[Pavel. I do not see the purpose of this move. Think about the purpose which you saw in it.

P9 is better
M9 even more because W must respond
the cut at N10 will now work even easier...];W[sp];B[ok];W[kk]
;B[ol]C[Pavel: Needless. O8 would be better, but I prefer M8, A9 etc.]
;W[gj];B[fj]C[Pavel: This B move prevents (in gote) W from gaining 1 point in gote (by slight reduction of B territory)
A9 or M9 would gain more and the opponent would have to answer

Pavel:
My main recommendations:
- notice all cutting opportunities of botf yourselg and the opponent - and use/protect them
- practise in reading. Solve www.goproblems.com

- be careful about not making moves which bring you nothing
- you should gradually grow in the ability to estimate when it is the correct time to secure corners. (If you do it too early, you may miss bigger plays. If too late, the opponent will take the corners.)

It was a pleasure to make this review and it tought me also some things. If anything is unclear, you can ask me by email. 

Your comments show that you think much about your move - and such players inevitebly grow. So I wish you much joy in growing further.
