C[Brodie:  Hello.  I played as Black.  In retrospect, I think I can identify some of the local errors which I made, but I seem to be having a lot of trouble with a few more global problems.
  Lately I seem to let opponents take too much control of the center and then do not see how best to invade this.  Also, in the this game, I always seemed to be just one or two moves behind.
  Thanks for any advice in advance! =o)];B[qc];W[dp];B[dc];W[qp]
;B[cf];W[kp];B[kd];W[pj]C[Fine yose so far.]
(;B[qh]C[I think this would be better around D10, though it probably is only a small difference.

Reviewing again, this is indicative of your conenctration on territory instead of thickness. (See variation where I played D10)]
;W[dj]
(;B[cl]C[This feels a little heavy now.  The standard sequence will lead to you supporting D4 after white gets F4 which fits well with white's chinese.]

(;W[cn]C[I think white would have been better to force at C9 first.]
;B[cj]C[Fair enough.];W[dk]C[I would have played D8 instead of D9 as white.]
;B[ck];W[em]C[Brodie: Up to here, things seem pretty even, but white seems to be getting more control towards the center.  That seems to be a definite problem with me lately.  I rush for territory, and rarely react soon enough when someone threatens to take a large piece of the middle...
--
I would be somewhat unhappy as black, you've got a bit too much territory and a bit too little influence.  E7 was a good move by white and things are looking good.

Your two choices where you differed signficantly from me are R12 and C8, both of which lead to you getting territory instead of influence.

Still, I think the game is far from over.  You have P4 (which I would play next).  There is also a few big moves around the top, from D11, P12, L10, etc.  I'd leave them for now.  Finally you could consider something like F3 instead of P4, but it feels very deep now and I fear you'll give up too much influence.]
;B[nf]C[I don't like this.  It isn't building on the borders of your influence (P12), it is simply grabbing on your own.

White could do a simple joseki like Q12 to seal that edge, then jump around D12, and I feel you'd slip quite a bit behind.]
;W[jj];B[di]C[This is pretty good, but I wouldn't play it quite yet.]
;W[ei]
(;B[ci]C[Given you have C8, I'd have played D12 or even E12 there.]
;W[eh]C[Ok, I feel you're in big trouble now.  You've got lots of points, so the goal seems to be to sacrifice some of them in exchange for reducing white's beautiful moyo.

This means that grubbing moves like S10 are out.  You also can't afford to solidify any more (e.g. E14, G16).]
;B[dl]C[Brodie:  Looking back on it, this seems awfully pointless.
--

Yeah, ajikeshi];W[el];B[cq]C[Brodie:  White is starting to get a bit much, and maybe a corner invasion will help.  Interestingly enough, the result here helps bail me out of trouble later on.  I'm still a little bit uneasy about 3,3 invasions when other stones such as C6 are around.
   Worse yet, 3,3 invasions are so common, I'm afraid that I use them too often, and rarely know when and how to invade strongly otherwise.  That's a rather broad comment though, so I suppose it's outside the scope of your review ;-)
--
I wouldn't invade at the 3x3 here.  Remember back to Chikkun's book, you are ahead on territory and behind on influence, so you should be concentrating on building up your influence, not your territory.  3x3 invasions exchange influence for territory, exactly the opposite of what you want here.

The problem with 3-3 invasions when white has supporting stones is they often don't end in sente like normal 3-3 invasions do.

Incidentially, I think locally the 3-4 point (D3) is slightly better than the 3-3 point here.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[cr];B[br];W[co]C[C5 feels wrong.  D2 would have been more effective at ensuring white ends in sente.]
;B[bo]C[I would have played D2];W[bn]C[D2 better, this points towards black's very solid shape so is not useful.]
;B[dr]C[Right];W[er];B[cs];W[hd]C[Well, at least white ends in sente, but leaving awful aji at E3.]

;B[je]C[I think this is too passive];W[if];B[nm]C[***
Brodie:  This play is kind of weird.  I feel almost certain that it isn't the usual way of doing things ;)
From here I figured I would be able to start moving in around the side at R7, or somewhere along the bottom at 04, or 03.
   I was slightly intimidated by the fact that white was loosely control this entire half of the board, so I thought having at least one stone in the area might be helpful.  I assumed I'd get chased around someway, and did not want to run to the center.  I felt having one stone there could make just enough of a difference.
  Would it have been better to have just jumped in around R7?  Part of the problem was that I didn't want to be limited to some small enclosed group.  If white seals off the invasion, he will surely have a large territory in the middle, so I wanted to be able to run and simply eat up as much of this area as possible.
   This move is where all the trouble starts, and it is the one I'm most confused about.
--
Ok, you're right it isn't the usual way of doing things, but it is quite a hard move to respond to.  I've seen it used by white after the players play on all 9 star points, though never by strong players.

The general idea is to either invade and live, or reduce.  O7 is far too deep to escape, so it is an invasion rather than a reduction.

Where are you going to find eyes?  Normally they're found on the edge.  Living in the middle is hard.  On the other hand, if white simply blocks the edge with say R7, then black can O10.]
;W[pm]C[Brodie:  White guards the side, so I start in towards the bottom.
--
Fair enough.];B[np]C[Though I would have been tempted to start here in the first place.  The exchange of O7 for Q7 seems wrong now.]
;W[mq];B[oo]C[Brodie:  Not sure about this.  I think pressing straight down may have been stronger.  At this point I seemed worried about  O4 and O7 being cut.
--
you have to play very lightly since you're so deep.  Personally I would be tossing up between Q4 and R3, and I probably would go with R3 (which probably results in O4 dying)]
;W[pp];B[om]C[Brodie:  Yeah, I think this was bad; perhaps, I just clicked too fast out of habbit.
--
It is bad.  O3 would be ok here]
(;W[pn];B[nq]C[Brodie:  moving straight down seemed like a good idea, and it was something I wanted to do, but N4 would likely have given my group a little more protection.  From here things go even farther down hill..
--
I think this is ok];W[mp];B[mo]C[I don't think you're getting enough in exchange for letting white have M5.

Look, you're connected to O7, and a move at O10 would connect you to safety  Why not get out of there while you still have some aji for a reduction of the center/left?  These moves do enlarge your group, though not enough for two eyes, but they give white great shape.

Additionally, they dont' put enough pressure on white.  A very courageous white could answer at O10 now and you'd be trapped.  I personally wouldn't because I don't think white could answer M5 at L5 which means black can live in the middle, but you get the idea.]
;W[lo];B[mn]C[Brodie:  Right now, I'm thinking O9 would have been much better.  I'm unable to get an eye at O6 anyway; maybe I should have kept running instead of slowing down for this.

(;B[ri];W[rk];B[pd];W[nh];B[od];W[le]C[Ok.  lets take stock of the score.

You're wonderful result in the bottom means you've destroyed white's huge moyo there.  A move like F3 would even turn it into about even territory.  You also have either four points in sente at E10, or else white will save D10, which gives you a weak attack on J10.

I also worry a little that Q5 is sente, which means white could Q5, then R2

You have around 20 pts in the top left (white has A10).  You have 35 pts in the top right (white has K16).  You have 5 pts in the bottom left, a similar number in the bottom right.

Total, 65 pts.

White has half a dozen points on the bottom, and 15 pts along the right.  White has fairly good prospects for getting more, but it seems you're K6 group has won teh game for you.  Given this, the correct move definately seems to be F3.  This settles the left group, lets you start looking towards harassing J10, and maybe even getting J14 in.]

Whereas after B17, white gets wonderful shape.

While white can connect so easily to D10, you're not going to get a huge amount from J11.  I am also a little concerned that you'd weaken K7.]

--
Ok, to summarise.

At the start you went after territory more than power and ended up giving white too much power.  Three times (top right, middle left, 3x3 on the bottom left) you sacrificed power for territory.  

You also played too passivly when white secured power, leaving yourself safe but quite a bit behind.  The territory orientated moves, and the passive play, left you in the awkward situation that you had to go for a desperate invasion.  

The invasion initially went badly but then white got greedy and the whole game fell into your hands. You had destroyed white's power without giving up your territory.  Game over.

Next you got back into making passive plays, allowing white to strengthen J11, and then didn't quite suport J3 correctly.  This let white pull a huge territory out of the ashes and suddenly the game was close.

Finally, you played a poor yose, playing a number of unnecessary moves while there were still good moves on the board.  H3 on its own cost you the game.  S14 didn't, but it did cost you the difference between W+3.5 and W+0.5.   

--

I think you've got two important lessons to learn.  Firstly that there is a balance between territory and power, and if you feel you're getting too much of one, start exchanging it for the other.  Playing games that are unbalanced is quite a lot harder than playing relatively balanced games.  If you see your opponent making a good moyo, think about the size of yours and concentrate on reductions/enlargements of yours.

I think if you just try to be aware of your opponent's moyo then you should be fine here. A basic understanding of the balance is quite easy to achieve.

Secondly, you need to fight much harder for your fair share of the points.  Moves like C11, B17, J12 H3, P7, A10, S14 are all wrong.  C11 and B17 are situations where you had as good shape as your opponent so you needed to streach more.  When your opponent has good shape and you have bad, then you have to play passive, but at C11 you had good shape, and at B17 your opponent had bad shape.

Moves like J12, you just have to accept that white got J11 and deal with it by taking the next biggest point.

Moves like H3 and S14 are the same as passing.  You just can't afford to pass.

I think the key for you improving this is to play with more intensity (which most people can only do if they play slower).  Perhaps making small bets with yourself would help? Or rewards for winning five in a row?
--
Despite that, you did a lot of things right.  Your understanding of shape was fine, and you seemed to have a fairly good understanding of the score throughout the game.  Your reading also seems to be fairly good.  Most aspects of your game seem a little stronger than 9k :-)

In your next few games, take your time and try to push a little bit harder.  Ignore moves you see as small, and answer a few more creatively.  Remember, if your opponent makes a smallish move, even sente, you can answer with a bigger sente sequence. Chances are you'll ignore one or two which aren't small and lose by resignation, but that's how we learn :-) 

Playing with some intensity gives you a huge advantage over opponents playing instinctively, even if they are 5 stones stronger.]
