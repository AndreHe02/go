Hi, I'm Tim, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'm about 5k on KGS.  If you have any questions about the review, you can reach me at timkington@gmail.com.

I don't think your biggest mistakes in this game come from playing the wrong moves to defend an area, but rather from failing to defend in the first place.  When you did decide to defend, you generally played reasonable moves.]
;W[dd]C[Zorglub [13k\]: bonjour];B[qj];W[pg];B[nd];W[rg]C[This is a terrible move for White. You should give his group a hard time now.]

(;B[lf]LB[rd:a][qm:b]C[This is an unusual shape.  I'm not sure that it's bad, but I would play at A or B.  A gets a lot of solid territory, B protects your stone below, which could be attacked.  Both of them will help you to attack the white stones later.]
;W[df]
(;B[ck];W[fp]
(;B[eo]LB[hp:a][hq:b][ip:c][iq:d][jp:e][jq:f]C[A pincer at one of the marked points would be better here, because of your stones to the right.]
;W[go];B[jp];W[ip];B[jq];W[qq]C[This is a big mistake by White.  The wall you get out of this will be worth MUCH more than the territory he gets in the corner.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn]
(;B[rm]C[Too aggressive.  See variation.];W[qm];B[pm];W[ql]
;B[pk]LB[pl:a]C[A is better - stay solid.  See variation.]
(;W[rk];B[rj];W[ri];B[pl];W[rl]LB[sj:a]C[You MUST play A.  You can separate White's groups.]
;B[qi];W[rh];B[oh]LB[in:a]C[This is small, compared to something like A.]
;W[in];B[jn];W[im];B[kl];W[id];B[kc]LB[ch:a]C[This is big, but I think A is a little bigger.]
;W[jc];B[kd];W[fl];B[fj]LB[dm:a]C[I don't understand what this move is trying to do.  You can't really attack the group at the bottom - if you wanted to do that, you needed to do it earlier.  I think A would be much better - it would help to solidify the territory on the left.]
;W[ci];B[el];W[fm];B[em];W[fk];B[fn];W[gn];B[hk]LB[hj:a][kj:a]
[dq:b][cc:c][sj:d]C[I guess this one is a mistake. Maybe  I should have played A ???
The following moves show how much I have difficulties defending my potetial teritry on the lower rigth corner.

If you're trying to increase the territory in the center, A would be much better.  Right now B and C are very big, and D may even let you kill the White group.  I would play D first, because you should be able to put pressure on the White group, and get out of the sequence in sente to take one of the other two big points.]
;W[gj];B[ej]LB[ek:a]C[This doesn't work. White can push through at A and seprate your stones.]
;W[hj]
(;B[gk]C[Followed by a second mistake :(

Yes.  Just let that stone go.  You need to worry about bigger things - this is only worth a few points.]
;W[ik];B[hm];W[hl];B[ij];W[jj];B[ii];W[jk]C[This is why the territory on the right collapses - look at all of the moves White has gotten in this area while you have answered him on the left.  If you had answered on the right to protect your territory, he would have about the same number of points, but you would get 40+ in the middle. See the variation.]
;B[gi];W[gl];B[kh]C[This helps to connect your stones, but not to protect your territory.]
;W[hi];B[ih];W[mj];B[lj]LB[ml:a]C[Too aggressive.  You need to back up to something around A.]

;W[mr];B[nq];W[lp];B[nr];W[kr];B[qr]C[This is definitely a mistake - you're going to have to take gote after playing this move.]
;W[rr];B[pr];W[rp]C[White chickens out - he should play elsewhere.]
;B[on]C[But then Black plays an unnecessary move, too.  This is worth a LOT of points.  The big points I mentioned earlier are all still available, and this move is worse than a pass - it's worth -1 points.

I can understand the impulse to play this move, but you need to try to read out the possibilities, and White can't do anything to you here.]
;W[eh];B[ge];W[gd];B[if];W[fe];B[gg];W[gh];B[hh];W[fi];B[cc]
LB[ge:a]C[Maybe a good time for invading ?

It's mandatory now, but it would be better to invade before you played the sequence starting with A.  This should still be okay.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[bc];B[bb];W[bd]
(;B[ca]C[This move seems unnecessary... ?

This move isn't doing much - it doesn't let you live, and it doesn't reduce White's territory.]
;W[fb];B[fc];W[fd];B[ed];W[ee];B[gb]LB[ab:a]C[I think you should just connect the ko here.  Then you should have two ways to get a second eye - A and this move.]
;W[ec];B[fa];W[gc];B[ed]C[Again, you should just connect the ko.  When you play this way, it's possible for you to die if White finds good ko threats.  If you have considered this possibility and decided he doesn't have enough, then this is fine.]
;W[hb];B[ga];W[ha];B[ec]C[Good.];W[gf]C[This is not worth anything for either of you.  Take sente.]
;B[hf];W[he];B[fr]LB[sj:a][rd:b][eq:c][er:d]C[A and B are still biggest.  I like A, but B gives you enough to win the game easily.  If you're going to play in this area, I think C or D would be better.]

This was a pretty close game.  I wouldn't say that White invaded your territory successfully - he broke through your walls, which is a different story.  In the early game, you could have done a better job taking advantage of White's weak groups.  Your territory in the lower middle could have been a lot bigger if you played there rather than around F10, and then in the later game the mistakes I saw were that you gave up sente unnecessarily several times, and there were a few times that you played protective moves that weren't needed.  Sente is worth a lot of points - in the early endgame as much as 15, so you need to think seriously about letting your opponent have it.

I hope that was useful.  Let me know if you have any questions.]

White is in a tight spot - he needs to do something to stabilize the group to the left, but anything he does will help you to get moves like A.]
