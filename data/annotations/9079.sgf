C[I play black. My opponent is Many Faces of Go 12 difficulty 15 
kyu. Normally I play against the 18 kyu difficulty, but because 
I am able to beat it 90% of the time on that difficulty I decided 
to turn up the difficulty. I play against this program quite 
often. The reason is that I don't have very much time to play 
against a person on a server such as KGS (games against this 
program last about 30 minutes at the most, while sometimes games 
on the server last up to a couple hours). I feel I did well, 
any and all comments are appreciated.

B: my comments start with B:];B[pd];W[qq];B[dp];W[ec]C[I play on the 4-4 points because it's the only points I really 
like to open on. I don't play on 3-3 because I feel it's too 
far into the corner, and I'm not sure why I don't play ones like 
4-3. I guess it's just preference?

B: it's also responding to the opponent. If he plays on 3-3, he takes the corner, but doesn't get much influence toward the sides and center. So if you play on 4-4, you don't take the corner instantly (he can still play at 3-3 under your stone), but you go for influence - and hopefully take more profit from this later on.]
;B[pp]C[B: good. Keep him in the corner.];W[cn];B[bo];W[nc]
;B[ob];W[qf];B[qi];W[fq]C[B: how will you respond if white follows up with C3?]
;B[dd]
(;W[ed];B[df];W[mq];B[kc]C[Was this a good move? I think it's called a pincer?

B: yes, I think that will work.];W[ic]
(;B[dj]C[B: you probably want to follow up on your pincher first. See variation for a possible attack by white.]

(;W[pq];B[np];W[mp];B[nq]LB[mo:A]C[B: playing A keeps white out of the center. But your move seems good too...]
;W[nr]LB[or:A]C[B: if you follow up on it. If you play A now, you split the white groups.]

(;B[iq]TR[fq]C[With this move I was trying to divide White's two groups while 
putting pressure on the marked stone.

B: seems like a good idea. I'd prefer to follow up on your previous move first. And what if white plays C3 now?]

(;W[or];B[mo];W[lo];B[lp]C[B: I think it is a bit too early to cut.]
;W[mr]
(;B[lq]LB[no:B][kp:A]C[B: better to play A, it gives you more liberties. Or defend the cut B.]
;W[no];B[op];W[pm]
(;B[qm]SQ[nl][ol][mm][nm][om][ln][mn][nn][on][ro][qp][rp]C[Was this a good move? Or should I have played somewhere else?

B: hm. The problem is your stone at N5 is almost captured, and your stones at O4 only have 4 liberties. White is strong in the squared area, so you have to take a loss, but keep it at a minimum.]

;W[mj];B[nk];W[li]LB[kc:C][dp:A][op:B]C[Was unsure of what to do. So I remembered some guidelines I was 
taught and decide to do the one that was to strengthen a group 
of your stones that are weak.

B: correct. In this case you have 2 weak groups and 1 single stone. Group A is weak - white can get into the corner. Group B is weak. Not connected, no eyes, 4 liberties only. Stone C is weak. But if you have to choose, I'd strengthen or connect B first.]

(;B[ke];W[ie]C[B: white responds, so now he is strong on that side. So you have to strengthen your (now 2) stones again.]

(;B[ig]LB[kc:A]C[B: weak move. As you will see, white can get through, and your 2 stones A are still weak.]

(;B[mh]C[B: try not to add stones to a group you cannot save.
See if you can use them go force white to take them and get something in return. See variation.]
;W[mi];B[kh];W[ki];B[ji];W[mc];B[kd]C[B: again, only play this if you know (of think) you can save them.]
;W[mn]
(;B[ko]C[B: better to play J5 for example. You make more shape and attack stone F3.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[oe];B[pe];W[pf];B[qe];W[cl];B[dk]C[B: I'd prefer B10. You don't want white to play under your stones.]
;W[em];B[fl]LB[gi:A]C[Good response? What could be better? I'm always unsure of when 
to play on the shoulder of a stone.

B: I'd prefer the side, but this also works. Yoou play it when you want to secure an area on the other side, in this case A.]
;W[fm];B[el];W[hm];B[gm];W[gn];B[gl]LB[gi:A]C[B: See how rthe shoulder hit results in you getting a nice area at A. But beware, white is now also stronger on the other side and can still get to you in the corner.]
;W[hn];B[fn];W[en];B[fo];W[kn];B[jo];W[kp];B[kq];W[hl];B[in]
LB[hk:B][gp:A]C[B: better to play something like A to keep white separated, or simply B to secure your area there. After yoy move, B is open for white.]
;W[bn];B[co];W[dq]C[B: white thinks it can kill you before you kill him?]
;B[cq];W[dr];B[cr]C[B: good responses.];W[gp];B[go];W[gk];B[hk]
;W[ho];B[eo];W[ik];B[hj];W[kl];B[jm]LB[im:B][jn:A][io:C]C[B: this gives you 3 cutting points. You'll lose one side or the other. See follow-up variations.]

(;W[fe];B[ff];W[ge];B[gf];W[hf];B[hg]TR[kc][kd][ke]C[Here I realized white had that entire top section and my 3 stones 
were dead. :(

B: they were already dead. M12 takes and your stones have nowhere to run.]

;W[tt]TR[ep][dq][eq][fq][dr][gr][es][gs]C[I feel I played pretty well. I wish I could have done something 
more with the stones at L15-17. I also spent a couple minutes 
trying to see if there was a way I could kill the marked stones, 
but I couldn't think of one. Once again thank you for reviewing 
my game.
-Andrew

B: before it where 3 stones, you could have given the 1 stone or later 2 stones up for a bigger area on the other side.
And as for the marked stones: there was a possibility earlier to cut them off (move 115).]
