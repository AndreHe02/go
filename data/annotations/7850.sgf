C[rs220675: Hi !

I hate games like that. My opponent manhandled me and I never got what did strike me. I think I lost it in fuseki. Please can you just review the game and point out the most obvious mistakes, esp. in fuseki?

I have just very little comments from myself, because I don't know where I began to lose the game...just feel free to point out only the real heavy mistakes that lost the game.

Please just review for white.

Thx in advance.

Az: W can play 'a' if you like, just a different game afterward.]

[me:A]C[Az: B should add a move to deal with the aji of the two stones, after B 'a' then W 'b'. This is a difficult overplay to punish, but there is where your opp cut a corner to seem to get ahead.]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[qh]TR[md][nc]LB[pg:A]C[Az: W should probably play 'a' to get out into the center and aim at activating those two stones later.]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[nq];B[pn];W[jp];B[cn];W[fq];B[fe]LB[db:A]C[Az: You must defend your corner before trying something crazy up top. This is big since you can use the threat of connecting to strong stones to help you invade the top. There is a danger when you start to feel behind of doing something very unreasonable that makes the situation worse rather than playing steadily.]
(;W[nb]C[Az: Heavy shape and the wrong timing. Locally speaking, the solid connection is the correct shape.]
;B[pb];W[me];B[nf];W[mf]LB[lb:A]C[Az: So heavy, W 'a' is necessary to get some eye space. The problem with this fight is that all of the B stones nearby are strong, and none of the surrounding white groups are strong. The very best you can hope for (and hope it is) is to just survive, but it'll cause tons of collateral damage to your other groups and recreate the moyo elsewhere.]
;B[ng];W[gd]LB[db:A]C[Az: 'a' is still better. This is just aji keshi, it serves no purpose. B's best answer is to connect, the moves in game went along with your plan.]
;B[ec];W[dc]C[Az: B should have just connected.];B[de];W[ce]
;B[lc];W[ee]LB[kf:A]C[Az: Not much point to this exchange, 'a' directly.]
;B[ef];W[df];B[fd];W[kf];B[mc]C[Az: W has failed here, black keeps at least as much territory as he has before and the UR corner is now in mortal danger. The game is fairly hopeless for white now.]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[dk];B[ek];W[ck];B[ej];W[dm];B[cp]C[Az: Strange move for black, he can connect and his position is fine.]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[bp]LB[co:A]C[Az: Unreasonable, 'a' is the normal move here.]
;B[co];W[br];B[dq];W[aq];B[cr];W[bq];B[ep]LB[el:A]C[Az: 'a' is still best for your opp]

C[Az: Probably better to atari first.];B[mq];W[rq];B[qp];W[rp]
;B[ro];W[rs]C[Az: A very clumsy blunder, this is the wrong atari to capture the stone.]
;B[sp]C[Az: Seems black is not thinking carefully either.];W[sr]
;B[lh]C[Az: A very good move, after this white can flail around a bit but there's no chance to win (remember that the UR isn't fully alive). End of comments.]
