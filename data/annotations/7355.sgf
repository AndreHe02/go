C[Hey Reviewer!  Thanks for taking the time to review my game.  I've only been playing for two months, and I haven't had much instruction so any help you can give me would be great!

J: Hi, I'm sorry I'm so late with the game; I've included quite a few variations, I hope you can see them all.

I liked the game, you went up from the middle game to final victory; just a couple of suggestions:

- try to look at the whole board from time to time
- do make sure your groups are alive or not! ;-)];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[cd];W[pp];B[fq];W[cn]C[I think I messed up josekis in this opening... I think this one is right but particularly the 3-4 point I think I messed up pretty bad.]
;B[iq];W[ed]C[Here.];B[gd];W[ef]C[j: no wonder why the opening is the most difficult part of the game... you are never sure what to do]
;B[cg];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[gf];W[gc];B[hc];W[fc]C[It wound up being my territory, but b has the territory on the left and influence on the right and I get squeezed through the middle, reducing any influence this group could exert.

J: errr yes, not a very nice outcome... this could be great if B were more solid in the upper right to begin with, now you've helped him]
;B[fh];W[eh]C[Borja [16k\]: <<<<];B[eg];W[fg];B[dg];W[ff];B[ei]
;W[gh];B[dh];W[gg]C[Me trying to get out of there to get some influence, maybe a mistake giving him the strength there but I figured I could use my lower left corner group to invade and reduce his possible moyo while extending my own, which I do later.

J: right thinking, and you can also use your upper group to attack the upper right side]
;B[hf];W[nc]C[J: I like the idea!];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[mb]

(;W[nb]C[I think I did alright with this joseki up to this point.  I wasn't sure what to do with his approach there.

J: I'd rather R17, no way to cut I believe... (a var follows)]
;B[lf];W[qc]LB[ng:A]C[Seizing the corner, maybe a mistake and I should've escaped at A.

J: well, the corner is not too bad, and now your group is a very solid one; escaping at A could be answered with B enlarging his right group, so I do not think R17 was bad at all...]
;B[qd];W[ng]C[Guess I did!];B[ph]C[jemwest [16k\]: ?

J: yes, that's the problem of O13. I'd rather play say R7 or whereabouts]
;W[pk]C[Didn't want him to extend all the way down the side, also trying to give me a base to attack and help my stones.

J: a bit too close to him IMHO, but good idea];B[ni];W[lh]LB[lg:A]
C[I realized this was a mistake.  I've heard that you should never use a knights move to escape, which makes sense because it can be split.  I think A would've been better.

J:: but the point is you don't need to escape, I can't imagine a way to kill your group. O3 looks very promising to me.]
;B[mh];W[mg];B[lg]C[Split. ez.];W[kh];B[oc];W[ob];B[rc];W[rb]
;B[pc];W[qb];B[re];W[sc]C[J: to get sure life T18 is better, T17 can lead to an annoying situation (see var in a couple of moves)]
;B[rd];W[le]C[Trying to not let him make a moyo right there.  Reducing his territory with a living group I think was my intention.

J: the idea is ok, only problem is group is not 100% alive]

(;B[ke];W[me];B[ld];W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[jg];W[if];B[ig];W[hg]
;B[ie]C[gg.  I'm not sure there was much I could do there without letting him connect or not doing anything.]
;W[ih];B[jh];W[ji];B[je];W[lj]C[Trying to gain a little bit of influence here.]
;B[ii]C[I saw this coming but didn't do much about it.  I figured both groups would most likely live (which they do), so I wasn't worried about the cut.

J: if you were not worried, why did you answer? It is better to go to a bigger place (say O3, c9, something like that)

BTW, b18 is quite good to be calm with the upper right];W[hh]
;B[ki];W[li];B[jj]C[Although I think this was an unexpected bad result, allowing that group to knife it's way down.]
;W[ck]C[j: good!];B[hb];W[gb];B[bb];W[cb];B[pn]C[Wasn't sure what to do here.  I wasn't too worried, but I think I could've responded better.

J: yes, q6 is an annoying move ;-) First decide what you want (secure actual territory or otherwise) - then go for it!]
;W[on];B[mq];W[qq]LB[qp:A][pq:B]C[I was afraid of a 3-3 invasion at this point, maybe A would've been better to solidify my territory on the upper side.  I think B would work to, but on the same level as the move I made.

J: I prefer B, if you play A the he can go to q2 ruining the corner. With B it is also possible to chase q6 to some benefit.]
;B[qk];W[ql];B[qj];W[pm]LB[pl:A]C[I guess I was afraid of the cut at A, but I felt it would be heavy to play there.

J: A seems solid to me, rather than heavy. Also, you know "don't touch what you're attacking"]
;B[pj];W[qn]C[j: this is not needed imho, but sure it made you feel better]
;B[ml];W[mk];B[nk];W[kk]C[I realized at this point my group there was in pretty serious danger, so I tried getting out.]
;B[jl];W[jk];B[ik];W[kl];B[mj];W[lk]C[j: no need! if he takes n9, you can always L10]
;B[nf];W[of];B[mf];W[oe];B[og]LB[mi:A]C[I was happy with this result, with the aji at A.  (btw, I'm new to all of the terms so if I'm using them wrong don't be afraid to correct me)

J: aji is correct here ;-)];W[jm];B[il]
(;W[km]C[j: why not... see var];B[fn];W[mn]C[I realized I was in trouble since there was no way I was going to make a base on the bottom, so I tried to connect to the group on the right side with this move.]
;B[lm];W[ln];B[kn];W[jn];B[ko];W[mm]C[j: good, proper tesuji!]
;B[nl];W[ll];B[rl];W[nq]C[I wasn't worried about his invasion, figured I would lose only a couple of points while this move could gain quite a bit more.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[od];W[mc];B[lb];W[qa]LB[na:A][sb:B][sd:C]C[I tried to read this situation and I thought that if I didn't move, he could kill my group.  A then B then C should make a straight three, if I'm not mistaken (not sure how to do variations), so I moved at the key point.

J: it is ok, finally ;-) B is also right to secure life there]
;B[na];W[oa];B[sd]C[A mistake if b was trying to kill my group, but only a one point mistake :-)]
;W[sb];B[ma]C[J: btw, this is quite small at this moment (remember d2 etc)]
;W[rm]C[threatened the cut while strengthening my group.];B[sl]
;W[gj]C[Not letting b make a moyo here, which I thought was a reasonable possibility.]
;B[ek];W[gl];B[cj];W[el]LB[bj:A]C[I don't think this move really did much... maybe a move like A would've been better.  Or something entirely different.]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[dq];W[cq];B[er];W[cr]LB[dr:A]C[Strengthening my piece while leaving aji at A which I use later to capture a fairly large group.]
;B[io];W[hn];B[in];W[im];B[hm];W[gm];B[hl];W[gn];B[go];W[ho]
;B[hp];W[jo];B[ip]
(;W[jp]C[j: pay a look at var];B[jq];W[lo];B[kp];W[lp];B[lq]
;W[kq]C[A mistake?  I only won by 12 points so I'll take what I can get!]
;B[kr];W[fo]C[j: very good you didn't L4];B[gp];W[eo];B[mp]
;W[hj]C[Threatening to cut while strengthening my connection.  Plus, maybe b would make another mistake...]
;B[ij];W[kj]C[I probably shouldn't have played here.  Endgame move, and I don't think it's quite the endgame yet.

J: yes this move is quite a good threat for later];B[ji];W[mi]
C[Ajikeshi?  Probably doesn't matter at this point.  Maybe more of an endgame move at this point.  I don't remember if I thought the endgame had begun or what...]
;B[nh];W[nj];B[oj];W[ok]C[I actually forgot here that the ko would take away those 3 stones I split off, I was kinda happy with this until he filled in the ko... not many ko threats for both of us.]
;B[mj];W[rk];B[ol];W[pl];B[nj];W[sk]C[j: better S10];B[rj];W[sm]
C[I think it worked out pretty even though anyways.  Maybe even better for me.]
;B[sj];W[ce]C[I thought that maybe I could split this group from the living group below it.  I wasn't really sure how and obviously made a mistake.]
;B[be];W[bf]C[Probably here.  Maybe it wasn't possible period.]
;B[cf];W[de];B[bg];W[dk]C[But no biggie.  It would've been nice and I would've won by a fair amount more, but it wasn't huge.]
;B[dj];W[fi]C[A poor threat.];B[nr];W[oq];B[or];W[pr];B[no]
;W[nn];B[oo];W[po];B[fj];W[eh];B[fk];W[fl]
(;B[gk]LB[eb:A][fh:C][gi:B]C[I didn't care about me being split now.  B didn't get any territory out of it, and I was a little worried about the top group (I wasn't sure if A would kill it) but now I was confident I could make an eye at either B or C.  Although looking back, maybe not...

I believe connecting was OK, A could kill the group and the possible eye at B (not C) is not sure]
;W[hk];B[ej];W[fe]LB[ee:A]C[So I decided to make an eye at A.  I realized that if b took one more corner it would be miai for a false eye, so later on I take another corner to make sure.]
;B[ge];W[np];B[mo];W[os]LB[mr:A]C[Threatening the cut at A so I can push a little further into his territory.]
;B[mr];W[ns]C[j: this is gote and worth... very little];B[op]
;W[pq];B[ms];W[ps];B[jr]C[I spent a fair amount of time looking at this spot with all of black's bad aji, thinking maybe I could get a fairly large cature.  I don't know if I could or not, but I didn't.]
;W[dr]C[Using the aji now, which turned out working really well.]
;B[eq];W[es];B[fs];W[ds];B[pe];W[fp];B[dl];W[dm]C[I may have messed up in this sequence.  I'm not sure if there was much I could do, but I was more worried about my 7 stones than my 3.]
;B[cl]
(;W[en];B[bl];W[bm];B[ak];W[am];B[al];W[gr]C[This was why I liked the aji from before. I was expecting to just expand into his territory, but he messed up and let me cut his groups.  This may have given me the game.]

;B[ca];W[da];B[ba];W[dd]LB[eb:A]C[Taking the corner to ensure an eye.  I think what ensued was a rabbity six up there which he could've killed at A.  So thank goodness b didn't take a corner earlier.]
;B[bd];W[ha];B[ia];W[ga];B[jb];W[hi]C[1 point of territory, yay for endgame.]
;B[fd];W[df];B[ls];W[kp];B[om]C[I'm not really sure what this move was trying to do...  I puzzled over it for awhile because any zero point moves make me worried.

J: oh yes, I can really understand... but seems worthless to me]
