;B[dp]C[Greetings! This was a tournament game with 45 minutes main time and 5x20 seconds byo-yomi. I am a 9 kyu on KGS and played against an opponent of about equal strength.

RG: Hi, I'm Robin, my comments are marked with my initials.  

My overall impresion is that you don't yet appreciate how dangerous it is to have weak groups on the board, and in this game you are fortunate enough to have an opponent who doesn't know how to attack them.  You seem to have a good grasp on the balance of territory, but not so much on the balance of power.  Worry less about making territory, and think more about making thickness, and you'll find that the territory tends to come by itself.

(;W[nc]LB[qc:C][rd:B][qh:A]C[I feel like the joseki I chose here is suboptimal, as black gets a really strong result. Would invading at A have been better? Are there any other good options?

RG: This move is OK, as is invading at A.  The key, though, is the next move.  When black plays B, you should invade at A, rather than submissively responding at C (see variation)

In the most part, the niren-sei joseki are applicable here (ie a stone on the lower 4-4 point rather than a shimari), so if you want to search josekipedia etc, try that rather than a shimari.]
;B[rd]
(;W[qc];B[ph];W[cj]LB[ci:A][fq:B]C[You could also consider invading at A, or approaching at B.]
;B[ch];W[cm];B[co]LB[gq:A]C[RG: Playing at A next is probably the best move]

(;W[cq]LB[jc:B][rc:D][rh:E][fq:C][jq:A]TR[cj][cm]C[This move wasn't well thought out, I realise. I let black have a wall facing my stones, which made them very weak. Maybe playing at A to have a double-wing formation was better? Or extend at B?

RG: Yes, this is a very bad move. See the variation for a better approach.  What you need to keep in mind is that every time you invade a position, your opponent gets outside influence.  After this sequence plays out, you are significantly behind in the game.

Of your 2 suggestions, A is by far the better move, making a double-wing extension from the corner, and looking to approach at C.

B is not urgent.  If black plays B, you respond at D, and black then needs to think about your invasion at E.]
;B[dq];W[dr]LB[jq:A]C[RG: not too late to tenuki at A ...];B[er]
;W[bp]LB[bn:A]C[RG: Instead of this, you could play A in sente, and undo some of the damage...]
;B[bo]LB[br:A]C[At this point you should play A, and set up a Ko.  This allows you to tenuki to repair some of the damage and leave some aji in the corner.]

(;W[cr]
(;B[eq];W[ar];B[kq]C[RG: This extension is bigger than it looks at first glance, because it also reduces your framework.

You might be inclined to think "well, black has lost 15-20 points in the corner, and the side is worth about the same", but you need to also add in what white has lost on the lower side.  Looked at this way, the corner invasion through here has lost you ~20 points, not counting the damage done by weakening your left-side group.

The variations show a couple of possible continuations.]
(;W[jd]LB[kc:X][rc:X][bd:B][ej:A]C[RG: Right now I'd be inclined to help the weak group on the left with a move like A.

In the upper right, you can consider the two points marked X as miai, so there's nothing urgent in that area of the board.  The best way to limit Black's framework is to eliminate your weaknesses, so that he can't push you around.

The other thing to consider is invading at B, - see the variations.

Also, I wouldn't play this move on the 4th line - if black counters on the 3rd line as he does, you need to jump down to take territory where you really want to jump out and make a framework.]
;B[eh]
(;W[ej];B[hc];W[jb]C[This is exactly why the 4th line was a bad idea.]
;B[em];W[gk]C[I'm a bit at a loss here, because it doesn' matter in which direction I jump, my opponent will get solid territory either way.]
;B[gm]
(;W[io]LB[ej:A][jj:C][io:B]TR[kq]C[Right now, what I dislike about my position is that I have 2 weak stones/groups at A and B, and that black has no real weak stones except for the triangle stone

RG: My first priority would still be to settle the left-side group, maybe jump out around C.

If you want to attack the triangle stone, this is the perfect situation for a shoulder hit, see variation.]
;B[ip]TR[im]C[As Black, I would try some kind of splitting attack - this move just helps you out.]

(;W[jp];B[iq]
(;W[lo]LB[kn:A]C[RG: this is quite a good move - myself I would prefer A, which gives you better shape, but the idea is good.]
;B[jq];W[kp]LB[jk:A][il:B]C[RG: This is not so great - up to this point you have a flexible group that is hard to attack, but now it's starting to get heavy.  I would suggest something lighter, such as A, or B, which use your invasion stones to help the weak group]
;B[ho];W[in];B[hn];W[gf]LB[gh:A][il:B]C[I wanted to prevent a black move at A. Or could I potentially have played at A myself?

RG: I would play something like B, to help the weak group.]
;B[ff]LB[gh:A]C[RG: black is helping you out again :)  They should play A,for a splitting attack.]

Also, A is the same idea, but much bigger.];B[qn];W[pl];B[on]

(;W[ii];B[hh];W[gi];B[gh]C[RG: actually, this isn't such a bad outcome for you - the wall on the outside significantly strengthens your last remaining weakness.]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[nk];B[ol];W[pk];B[om];W[pn]LB[pj:A]C[RG: Connect at A.  While  the game sequence does work, this move takes all the aji out of the situation, and threatens the black group above.]

RG: not that I can see.

The big end-game moves at this stage are the ones marked A-E.  I'd probably exchange 1 for 2, then take one of these 5.

Your sequence is not so bad as it stands except for one thing: it ends in gote, and lets black take the first large yose move.]

[ce:2]C[RG: This way, white takes the corner.  

It's too early for white to play this sequence out in full (as with the lower left corner), so if black responded with 2, you reduce from the outside, somewhere like A.  The idea now is that Black is in a bind: if he responds to A at B, he's not getting much because you can carve out the corner with 3 and 5 any time you like.  If he defends the corner, you extend to one left of B, and the corner is small.]
