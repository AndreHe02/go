Review by John Rae. IGS 4kyu

Overall I think you can learn three broad lessons from this game

a) consider whether your moves keep sente. 
b) pay less attention to capturing single stones and be more willing to sacrifice your own sotnes
c) think about invasions, both the timing of your own and the possibility for your opponent to invade you.


Some time on these things will help develop a better feel for which moves are biggest , which will mean your results  improve significantly.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[pn]C[[JR\] This seems a little thin to me. You need to be careful leter in the game that white does not invade the bottom corner.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[nd];B[oe];W[pc];B[qc];W[kc]C[[JR\] Black seems to have played a 4-4 joseki for his 3-4 stone. Its solid enough but doesn't feel ideal.]
;B[pi];W[gd];B[co];W[fp];B[dl];W[cp];B[bo]C[[JR\] D6 would seem more natural for black and seems an inviting point for white now.]
;W[do];B[dn];W[jq];B[ci]C[[Glonojad\] Should I make a bigger jump here (for example c12)?

[JR\] If you're going to jump I'd go all the way to C14

On the other hand I think I prefer M3 because it seems to put more pressure on white's group and makes the left side a more 3 dimensional shape for black.]
;W[cg]
(;B[qk]C[[Glonojad\] Is this move to slow?

[JR\] This does not seem to make the territory above or below much more secure. I would prefer M3]
;W[bp];B[hp]C[[JR\] This leaves danger at C6];W[cn]
(;B[bn]C[[JR\]  This is the wrong way];W[cm];B[dm];W[bm];B[bl]
;W[ao]
(;B[eo];W[an]C[[Glonojad\] What do you think about idea of building influence on the bottom (about 4-5 line) and my attemp to do so?

[JR\]

Firstly forcing white to capture helps white. Now when white pushes at C8 the block at C9 is no longer atari. This is enough ereason not to play F5

Secondly there is minimal influence and you need to have a plan of doing something with the influence. Normally this idea would be to use the influence to attack something or to support an invasion. i don't really see that option here.]

(;B[go];W[mq]
(;B[hr]C[[Glonojad\] What do you think about K5 (or other possibilities)?

[JR\] Well I like keeping the white groups separate.

On the other hand your last few moves were for influence so its logical to continue with the strategy.]
;W[mn]
(;B[lp]C[[JR\]  This does not work out too well. I think a less close attackis more appropriate]
;W[mp]
(;B[kp]C[[JR\] But having played M4 you want to cut off white's K3 stone to leave the others running without eyes.

The trouble is N3 lets white hane and do rather nicely.];W[lr]
C[[JR\] Letting white get this base is also not so good - which is why I feel M4 was not right in the first place.]

(;B[jp]C[[JR\] This must be to defend the 2 stones - since the influence is much weakened by N6 looking over it.

Since it is only 2 stones its not big at this stage. I would consider sacrificing them and using sente to make a bigger play elsewhere.]
;W[kn];B[kr];W[qp]C[[JR\] Ouch - white has built up the wall on the N line to support this, which will cause great damage.]
;B[pp];W[qq];B[qo];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[ro];B[rn];W[sp]
;B[jl]C[[JR\] Yes, nicely pushing white towards the strong black side]
;W[kq];B[lq];W[nr]
(;B[jr];W[os]
(;B[in]C[[JR\] It protects a little in the centre but it is gote

I think the alternatives are better.];W[eg]
(;B[mo]C[[JR\] White is building a big corner it is essential to invade now]
;W[no];B[lo];W[oo];B[po];W[np];B[nm];W[nn]C[[JR\] This does not really help, and becasue you end up playing to defend it it becomes gote]
;B[om]C[[JR\] Yes this expands the side but you cannot afford to let white have sente - as the next few moves show. They are all big for white!]
;W[cl];B[dk];W[ne]C[[JR} It makes a huige difference that white gets this point rather than black.]
;B[of];W[mg];B[if]C[[JR\] And now white has a huge moyo so you invade, but not as deeply as you could before]
;W[id]C[[JR} White is "forced" to make the territory solid, which she wanted anyway.]
;B[ih]C[[JR} I think you have to risk losing this stone and play the invasion at C17 before its too late.]
;W[cc]C[[JR\] This is huge.

See how the last few moves by white have

a) been sente, forcing your replies
b) all take points black wanted
c) make a huge addition to white's territory.

The last 5 moves by white probably make the difference in the game.]

(;B[ep]C[[Glonojad\] Is this move too slow?


[JR\]  It seems to capture 1 stone so its far too small];W[eq]
;B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[dj];B[ej];W[ck];B[di];W[cj];B[fi];W[kh]
;B[ln]C[[Glonojad\] And what about this one?
How should I've played to gain as much territory in the center as possible?

[JR\] this seems OK but see later];W[mm]
(;B[ml]C[[JR\] The trouble is this does not actually make more territory on the side but pushes white into the centre territory]
