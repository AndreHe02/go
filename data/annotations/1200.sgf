SpaceDog:
Hi, I'm SpaceDog, White in this game. Thanks for taking the time to look at this. I felt I was very lucky to win (by 0.5). I've added a few comments in specific areas. But one specific area of concern for me is that I don't think I play the opening very well.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk]C[SpaceDog:
I'm not good at handling this sort of opening.

Olaf:  until now i can't see any mistake. ;-)]
(;W[dj]C[SpaceDog:
Anything else? I'm not too comfortable with san-ren-sei myself; I always feel I'm not using the influence properly.

Olaf:
Another choice would be O17 (see variation) but in my eyes your move is quite playable too.]
;B[fc]
(;W[df]C[Olaf:
if you are afraid of the outside influence you offer black, you can play a pincer against F17. but it is more a matter of tastes.]
;B[jd];W[po]C[SpaceDog:
At this point Black's huge sphere of influence looked impressive enough to warrant this, even though I knew it would come under fairly severe attack. Is there a better move?

Olaf:
The essence of the chinese opening is to build moyos, hoping that white will invade them. To follow this idea, black would like more to play around K4 next than to close the corner at Q5/R5. Taking this into acount, i think it is wiser for white to take a point around K4 for himself. Note: if you play at K4, would black close the corner next? And if so, than your stone at K4 would restrict his extension on the side properly.]
;B[np]
(;W[no]C[Olaf:
the first real mistake. this way you are making black strong while you don't get a base by yourself. On the right, you are outnumbered by black, so you have to play in that a way, that you get a base quickly.]
;B[mp];W[op];B[oq]
(;W[ol]C[Olaf:
again you are helping black to build a wall.
Another idea would be to offer black some of your stones but reduce his moyo in the same time. I don't really now if it works (poor amateur too) but the situation requires more light play now.]
;B[ok];W[nl];B[nk]C[Olaf:
to slow. N10 would look better to me.];W[ll];B[cn];W[co];B[dn]
;W[fq];B[bk];W[dl];B[cl];W[bn]C[Olaf:
this is the wrong direction. your key-territory is above the black group. The black group is not real killable.]
;B[bm];W[bo];B[ci];W[di];B[bh];W[kd]C[SpaceDog:
Hoping to get sabaki in Black's sphere of influence, though sabaki is not something I'm good at.

Olaf:
But you got the right idea. :-)
To illustrate: On such a point of the game, a short estimate of it:
white has about 17 points secure territory in the lower left. Thats all. The upper left is open for invasion on both sides and the right group will survive small.
black has 10 points secure on the bottom, 5 points on the left and a moyo in the upper right quarter of the board (which should bring another 10 points minimum).
White has to do something spectacular now.
The influence on the left (facing the center) should help white starting a battle on the top. So it is best to go into a battle there.]
;B[je]
(;W[od]C[SpaceDog:
Is this move alright? It's the sort of move I would never play, and I don't know what made me play here on this occasion.

Olaf:
Hard to say. There are other possibilities too. I would try to reach the center while splitting the black forces, but black has some countermeasures too. On the top you faces some difficulties]
;B[oe];W[pc];B[nd]C[Olaf: good. the white forces gets separated.]
;W[qd];B[oc];W[qf];B[qh];W[qb]
(;B[qm]C[Olaf:
before something else, black should play once at Q18 (see the variation)
After that exchange i would play at L17.];W[pm];B[ql]C[Olaf: only necessary, if black will kill white in the future. But this will be very hard. Again stabilizing the top would be bigger.]
;W[hc]C[Olaf: very good.];B[fe];W[jc];B[cc];W[dc];B[ce];W[de]
;B[cf];W[dh];B[ch]C[Olaf:
why that? looks like a typical klicko to me.]
(;W[he];B[ke];W[ld]C[Olaf:
good again. It is said that the ponnuki is worth about 30 points. In these circumstances black can't use the power of the ponnuki.]
;B[le];W[id]
(;B[jq]C[Olaf: not urgent. The interesting area is on the top.]
;W[gf]C[Olaf: right direcktion.];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[mo]
C[Olaf:
only 2 bad moves (C12 and K3) and the table turns completely. Now it is black who is behind in territory. Not much, but the fact must be frustrating after the good outcome of the opening. So right, it is necessary to attack something. But this move is clearly the wrong direction. In itself this move doesnt add something to the black territory. Furthermore the stone at K3 now looks too narrow to the strong black position. Black has to attack from the other side, lets say N9.]

(;W[nn]C[Olaf:
White should play at N9 by himself now.];B[pb];W[qc];B[pe]C[Olaf:
completly meaningless.]
(;W[ob]C[Olaf: too small. Now the keypoint is the center. There is a frontierline between two areas: a white on the left and a black on the right. whoever has the initiative, he should try to move the frontier closer to the opponent.]
;B[nb];W[pa];B[qe];W[re]
(;B[og]C[Olaf:  The black center is open on 2 sides. It is ometimes hard to decide which side to close first. But in these circumstances, first attack the weak white stones while extending your territory, than reduce the white possibilities in the left center while closing the other side of the own territory must come first.]
;W[mk]C[Olaf:
very good point];B[mj];W[lj];B[mi]
(;W[hi]C[SpaceDog:
I knew I'd probably need a fair amount of centre territory by now. Perhaps there's a better place for this stone?

Olaf:
How many is the fair amount? try to count:
Black has 20 points on the left, 20 points on the bottom and 20 points on the right = 60 points
White has 17 points in bottom left, 10 points top right 22 points on top, 4 points on the small center group = 59.5 points (with komi, without the center)
You see there are no needs to do something special. But you are right, there are better places for your stones. :-)]

too small. the black connection on the right would be very big, so white should try to forstall it.]

At this point I thought I was behind a bit, so tried to play a good endgame, keeping sente.

now if white playes at P18 sometimes, it will be gote. Without these exchange it will be sente.]
