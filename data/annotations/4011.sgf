C[Alright, let's see here... Robb, I'm not sure if you were White or Black... but since White is the one who lost, I will do most of the reviewing for him/her.]

C[This corner play is really easy to get cut, because of how big it is.  Since you are newer, it would probably be better to play at the labeled spot instead.]
;B[qm];W[qk]C[This was actually pretty smart here, you used your other stone to help limit that blacks stone.]
;B[pm];W[rm]C[This wasn't really the best move for this point in time.  The corner stone is now in danger, because it has black surrounding it on two sides.]

;B[rd];W[jq];B[hq];W[fq];B[ho];W[fo];B[ir];W[dm]LB[dl:A]C[By playing here, you have decided to give up on the stone at K3 perhaps?  If so, then farther out might have been ebtter for this move.]
;B[dg];W[di];B[ek];W[jd];B[ld];W[lc]LB[kc:A][gd:B]C[Contact play isn't often your friend.  Since you played here, you  allowed him to cut you, and make a large wall surrounding his side.  Labeled points would have been better.]

;W[ng];B[ph];W[jb];B[id]C[Once he played that, those two stones were dead.  It would be better to play elsewhere, than to let him build up his wall more.]

;B[da];W[bc];B[li]LB[ki:A]C[A would have been a better point here, because either way, if he cuts at J12, you will loose it, but with A11, you can play at H11 and enter his territory more while preventing him from cutting at L12.]

Not that bad of a game if it really was your first one.  Considering that, you should have been black, since in the newer ranks, black has more of an advantage, but oh well.]
