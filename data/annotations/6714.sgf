Dear reviewer,
First of all, thank you very much for reviewing my game. In this one, i played white and i finaly lost the game by 3,5 moku because i lost 5 stones at the end of the game, making by the way a small black group live.

I put some questions to help you.

Thx again

Thomas

Hello Thomas,
this is Martin. My comments will begin with "FM" as my nick is Field Mouse.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne]LB[qc:A][ld:B]
[qf:C]C[FM: The sansan invasion is the most common play now, but is also what black wants when he plays sanrensei. This is surely also playable as well as the B or C move.]
;B[pf]
(;W[kd]C[FM: according to some book theory, this move is not good]
;B[ld];W[le];B[kc];W[jd];B[jc];W[id]
(;B[ic]LB[hc:A]C[FM: A is much more common and faster way.]
;W[hd];B[gc];W[gd]C[FM: This shape is obviously much better for white than in the variation.]
;B[fb]LB[fc:A]C[FM: black should have played at A instead]
(;W[de]C[FM: White needs to stop black like in the variation. Like this the white corner territory is still too opened and the influence has still some weaknesses.]

(;B[fd];W[fe];B[ed];W[ee];B[dj]C[FM: this game will be hard for white now.]

(;W[dl];B[cg]C[how to play here ? i decided to defend my weakness but it seems a bit easy on black group]

(;W[ce]C[FM: Slow move and unfortunately black can still reduce the corner a lot in the future.]

(;B[cl]C[FM: very big.];W[cm];B[ck];W[dm]LB[cq:A]C[now black group is completly settled, nullifying the effect of my wall, and the invasion at A is still possible

FM: yes, the result is good for black.];B[fj];W[jq]
(;B[lq]LB[mq:A]C[FM: I would definitely play A now, black is leading and there is no need to provoke any fighting.]
;W[jo]
(;B[dq];W[cq]C[FM: correct side. The E3 have would make white too overconcentrated.]
;B[eq];W[cr];B[hq]
(;W[ir]C[FM: White is worried about the K2 connection, but this makes things easy for black.]

(;B[fo]LB[nq:A]C[is the result good for black or white ?
I prefer black here because both sides got a weak group but black group has better eye shape. On the other hand something round A is still possible

FM: As you said, both sides are weak now and must watch their steps carefully. I think black last move was a bit dame and gived white the upper hand in the area. But the fight is sitll not over...]

(;W[gp]LB[gn:A]C[FM: if white doesnt kill or cut black into parts, A is better.]

(;B[ip]TR[lq]C[FM: not so good peep, the marked stone becomes suddenly very weak.]
;W[jp];B[gq];W[io]C[FM: good shape move.];B[do]
(;W[co];B[go];W[gm];B[ep];W[cp];B[hr]
(;W[qn]C[o3 better ?

FM: O3 looks really tempting and better];B[nq]TR[lq]C[FM: Black manages to turn his weak stone into an attacking one.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[rq]
(;B[rp]TR[pj]C[FM: black gets too territorial here, but that hurts his marked stone.]
;W[qo];B[rr];W[pq];B[qr];W[op];B[pr];W[po]C[i'm very happy here

FM: yes, white shape is good and black is low];B[oq]LB[oc:A]
C[FM: This move looks like dame. Probably it's looking to kill white, but anyway A is the point of absolute importance now.]
;W[ro];B[sq]
(;W[qh]LB[oc:A]C[FM: If black had already a stone at A, his position would be much stronger]
;B[ph];W[qi];B[qj]C[FM: very sharp move. It requires a lot of reading before playing this way as black will have many cutting poitns soon.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[pg];B[oh]
(;W[qf]C[FM: Similar situation as in the lower left corner, solid connecting is almost always better. But in this position it doesn't matter much - the shape white gets with this move is excellent.]
;B[og];W[qg]C[FM: black has too many weaknesses now.];B[qe]
;W[of];B[pe];W[rj];B[rk];W[si];B[ok]LB[nj:A][ql:B]C[FM: Connecting like this and letting white A and B peeps is very painful, but necessary now]
;W[re];B[rd];W[sf];B[qc]C[FM: another painful move. Black result on the right side was a disaster.]

(;W[nd]LB[nj:A][ql:B]C[FM: White should play the A and B peeps as soon as possible]

(;B[rm];W[mo];B[lo];W[ln];B[no]
(;W[np]C[FM: good reading, but the squeeze is good for black.]
;B[mp];W[mn];B[on];W[om];B[pm];W[nn];B[ol]LB[nm:A]C[FM: strange move, capturing at A was very natural.]
;W[nm];B[pn];W[oo]
(;B[hn];W[jm];B[hm];W[nj];B[mk]
(;W[kk]C[i guess i should have cut at p10, my m6 group is not so weak

FM: turning back like this is good for black - if you didn't see other answer to the blacks last move you should not play the peep at all.]
;B[mj]TR[nj][mk]C[The marked exchange was very good for black, the black stone hurts white eyes shape and makes some extra points.]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[ql];B[qk];W[ki];B[ll];W[kl]C[FM: hard to decide how to protect, this is probably ok.]
;B[lf]C[FM: the vital point of the shape]
(;W[me];B[kf];W[ke];B[lh];W[kh]
(;B[li];W[jf]C[FM: very big move];B[jg];W[kg];B[lg]C[FM: very small move]
;W[gi]LB[bf:D][bg:E][fg:C][gg:F][fh:A][gh:B]C[at this moment of the game, i thought i was ahead

FM: the centre was a big succes for white - if you look seven moves behind the thing that happened looks like a small miracle. If next the A-B-C-D-E-F combination would be played, I think black is still in the lead, though only small.]
;B[ih]C[FM: very risky way of playing, if black dies here, he cannot win anymore.]
;W[hj];B[if];W[je];B[ij]
(;W[ik];B[hi]C[game over];W[hh];B[ii];W[gj];B[gh]
(;W[hg];B[hk];W[jj];B[gk];W[fi];B[il];W[jk];B[fh];W[ei];B[eh]
;W[ig];B[di];W[jh];B[ej]C[white is behind and it is impossible for him to catch black

FM: Yes. Losing this game only by 3,5 points sets you to be the endgame master :)
I hope you enjoyed my comments and wish you many enjoyed games
