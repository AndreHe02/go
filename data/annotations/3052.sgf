C[Hi, I'm W (aka John Raymond Wold), playing as a strong 5k on KGS under the username "woldsom". I'll be marking my comments with "W:"

I've gone trough the game basically looking for where I would play differently, and have tried to make comments that you can learn from. If you spot a go term you don't recognise, you can look it up at http://senseis.xmp.net

General advice comes at the end of the review. I've used a triangle to mark stones in danger, squares to mark of territory, letters to signify alternative moves, and numbers to indicate bad exchanges. I've also made my comments independant of these markings in case your sgf reader does not display them properly.

I hope this review will be of any help, if you have any questions, feel free to ask me by mail or on KGS.]

[jd:B]C[Is this too slack ?

W: A bit. The usual move is K16, where it's as wide as possible if you get it as territory, and small enough that you can get both sides (close to the right of K16, then take the corner) if white invades at H17. If you don't like flexible moves like this, and would rather your move has one purpose, the stone should be on the fourth line nonetheless, at J16. This is too low. Another option is to double-approach the hoshi stone.]
;W[jj]TR[dd]C[W: White is playing very influence-oriented here, occupying 5 star-points. But he neglects the top left corner, and you should attack at C14 at some time.]
;B[pj]LB[mc:B][lq:A]C[W: Very good, threatens a double-wing formation on both sides.]
;W[nc];B[lc]LB[lc:A][nd:B]C[W: Ignores the direction of play, you should attach to his stone, as he cannot gain much on the top side anyway.]
;W[pg]TR[pd];B[ne]C[I'am not sure about this move.

W: It's fine, attacks both stones and keeps them separated, while securing a way out for your hoshi stone should white take the corner. When you get a double aproach on a single stone in the corner, the answer is almost always to jump into the center.]
;W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[kc];W[kd];B[jd];W[kf];B[ng]TR[pg]C[W: Good, he saved one of the stones, you take the other.]
;W[je];B[ie];W[if];B[he]TR[dd]C[W: White helped you there, upgraded your third-line territory to fifth-line, and gave you even more thickness to attack D16]
;W[oh]
(;B[nh]LB[nh:A][mi:B]C[W: This is too close! White can just walk out ahead of you unless you take the chance to jump ahead. See variation for a possible play.]
;W[oi];B[oj]LB[oj:A][nk:B]TR[pd][me][ne][ng][nh]SQ[pl][ql][pm]
[qm][pn][qn]C[W: Again too close. By now you should realize you cannot capture, and try to gain territory while attacking. O9 is better for that. Then you need to secure life in the corner, as you're shut in.]
;W[ni];B[lg]TR[pd][me][ne][ng][nh]C[W: Does nothing beyond getting you some eye shape, which will still not be enough if white takes the corner.]
;W[mh];B[mi]C[W: Risky, white may try to create a semeai by playing M12. Does not gain much in any case.]

(;W[mj]LB[lh:B][mj:A];B[li];W[nj];B[cf]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[W: Good, but even better is on the fourth line]
;W[ce];B[df]C[W: Excellent, white makes it easy for you here.]

[kf]C[W: I would go for the whole group, but that's probably why I am still 5k. Atleast you close him in now, and have nice prospects for attacking J14]
;W[bc];B[ci]C[W: Better is K12];W[cj]LB[ci:1][cj:2]C[This exchange strenghtened white more than you should like. It is due to this move that the territory in the bottom left becomes so big.]
;B[fq];W[di];B[ch];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[fn];W[bj];B[dh]TR[fn]
[fp][fq]C[W: Ignores the weak stones. It does not help to have access to the center if no strong groups have, there is nowhere to run to.]
;W[pm];B[om]LB[ql:C][nm:B][om:A]C[W: This does not work. If you are going to attack Q7, attack from afar, perhaps with O7. If you are going to defend your side territory, do it up close on the correct side, for instance with R8]
;W[ol];B[ql];W[nm]C[W: OK, white makes it easy here, play R7 and the side is yours]
;B[on]C[W: Saving one point does you no good.];W[pl];B[qk];W[nn]
C[W: you still have the option of R7...];B[oo]C[W: Saving two stones? Four points gote and allow white to cut deeply into your side?]
;W[qn];B[qh];W[qg];B[ph];W[og]LB[og:2][ph:1]C[W: Q12 just strenghtens white, no need until you are desperate. Play S12 and S7.]
;B[rg]C[You insert a variation starting at O14, read my comments.]

(;W[qc]LB[qc:A][nf:B];B[qd]LB[pc:B][qd:A]C[W: Wrong side, you still can attack the M16 group, and both O13 and R12 are virtually alive.]

[am][bm][cm][an][bn][cn][ao][bo][co][ap][bp]C[W: Connecting two live groups...

At this stage of the game, white has no weak groups, while your f3 is quite alone in the mids of formidable white influence. White also have three out of four corners. It's a hard game from here on out.]

(;B[gh]LB[hf:B][gh:A]C[W: There's is a proverb saying that you shouldn't peep when you can cut, and another one saying you shouldn't make a move without a purpose. What is the purpose of this move? Much better is starting at H14.]

;W[er]C[W: Up until this move, you had the chance to invade at C3.]
;B[fr]C[W: Try not to answer your opponents endgame moves. Whenever he has made an endgame move, look at the whole board, find the biggest gote play, and play any sente plays that are half as big as that, then end with the gote play. Assuming your opponent follows YOU around in your sente moves, he's the one who would fall behind.

That said, yes, you do have to answer this one...];W[ro];B[rp]
;W[rm];B[sk]LB[sk:A][rl:B]C[This move loses a point. Sooner or later white will play S8, and you have to defend at S9]

[ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Basic advice to help you improve:

Early game (fuseki): Look for double-wing formations, and moves which have several options (miai), also don't consider territory or influence yett, the opponent can ALWAYS erradicate any territory or influence you build up, you just have to make sure that you will gain somewhere else if he does.

Middle game: Look for weak groups, both your own and the opponents. Make every stone you put down on the board have atleast one clear purpose, and know what you will play next whatever the opponent answers. Try to have atleast two non-weak groups with access to the center, that way you will have a place to run to should any weak group you have come under attack.

Endgame: Look for sente moves. If your opponent makes a move, look carefully how much you would potentially lose by not answering it for one move, and see if you can find some sente play elsewhere that's bigger. Only play Gote moves when sente plays are under half the size of the gote play.

In general: For each move you make, look over the whole board, find moves in all the different sites of action, and consider which of them is more urgent. Don't forget groups even if you think they've done their job. Sacrifice stones that don't serve any purpose, don't try to save them until the endgame.]
