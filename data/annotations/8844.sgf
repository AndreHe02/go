C[Reviewed by  Josh King (atreys)

Hi, this game looks good overall.  I have scattered comments throughout.  There is a variation from joseki at move 98 that I think is worth taking a look at.
Moves 8 and 37 are pretty similar and play against strength, which one should be wary of.
Review stops at move 126 (with the exception of 186)



=====
Thank you for taking the time to review this match. We have been playing every day for the 6 weeks, and believe this is our strongest game yet. Our hope is to learn even more through your guidance, every comment will be greatly appreciated.

Evan is Black, Jozef is White, we are both ranked around 17kyu on KGS, though we play much more often and at a slower, steadier pace in our offline games such as this one (played over about 2 1/2 hours).]

(;W[eq]C[Playing against F3 makes it stronger.  A typical response for black is standing at f4.
F3 doesn't gain you much at this time.  Later D6 is played.  It would be better to play that now instead of the exchange resulting from E3]
