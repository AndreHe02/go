C[Hello, my name is Jim Borden and I have been playing go socially for about 2 or 3 years (but about half that time was a hiatus in the middle while I finished school >_<).  Lately I'm feeling frustrated about a plateau that I've hit, and so I am anxious to see what comments I can get on my games :).  I promise I will also review games on GTL, so give me your best :).  Thanks in advance~

Hi Jim, my name is Gus, and I'll prefix my comments with Gus:

Enjoy! 

Summary:
It's hard to learn everything all at once. The MOST important thing for you to learn from this game is DON'T TOUCH WEAK GROUPS OR STONES. Attack from a distance and take profit. Even when you are killing you often don't need to touch because the only thing that matters is eye space. Only touch/fight when there is a specific way it helps you. 

The second thing to learn is that weak groups are the most important thing on the board. Weak groups are how you get free moves. When evaluating the score you can assume that a weak group with no eyes is -20 points or more, and a group with 1 eye is -10 points or more. Whenever you see a weak group don't think how can I kill it, think how can I get free moves (prefferably on the outside towards the center) by **** attacking **** it. 

Killing happens when your opponent declines to give you the free moves that he owes you.

If you just keep those two ideas in mind you will easily improve 2 stones or more.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[qo]C[ Gus: To me this is a little odd, Not necessarily bad, but not how i like to play at least. It presents the open side of your corner towards the the white stone, making approach moves by white slightly better. Also if you enclose the corner, then your natural extension is towards white's stone not your stone...]
;W[dd];B[oc];W[qp]C[What should I do about this as black?  There is no joseki that I know that starts here......It looks like a bad idea for white, but how can I use it to my advantage? -JB

 Gus: This is absolutely crazy by white. The first thing you should do when you see a move like this is smile :)

Secondly you should ask your self, why do I think it's bad. In this case the answer is that it unecessarily touches a weak stone. When you touch a stone you make it stronger. So when you read variations you should be paying attention and looking for variations that leave you stronger. Those are likely to be the right punishment.]

(;B[po]C[ Gus: as an initial reaction this is not bad. Extending when attached is often good, but in this case it leads to 4th line territory for white, and you should probably look for something better. Even so your wall and your strong shimari will create a very dangerous area for white if he invades.]
;W[pp];B[oo];W[op]
(;B[pj]C[ Gus: This is not very good. you are giving white the opportunity to hane at the head of 3 stones. Compare the variations for this move and the next...]

(;W[pl]LB[pm:A]C[Again, I've heard you can extend wall length + 1, but what should I do here? -JB

 Gus: Your opponent's move is not very good. This is just asking to be attacked. Furthermore the point of attack should be at A because that's where all the cool tesujis happen...]
;B[mo]C[ Gus: your move is basically ok since w played the wrong invasion and doesn't have any of those tesujis, you can probably also play o4]
;W[ok];B[np]C[ Gus: Good. The w stones are now going ot be pressed into the side, and white's last 2 plays will be an easy target for attack]
;W[nq];B[mq];W[nr]
(;B[pk]C[ Gus: Ah this is not how to attack weak stones. Touching them makes them stronger.... This is fighting, not attacking.]
;W[om];B[jp]C[ Gus: Why tenuki???

Also your stone is too close to your wall... furthermore, you can't make territory here because you are open at n2. This move is almost a pass.]
;W[ql]C[ Gus:now white can damage your territory, so your attacks will end in gote not sente... You will need to defend at s10 as soon as white can't be chased anymore.]

(;B[qg]C[ Gus: You must at least attack weak groups as soon as you can. If you do that here you won't need this defense.]
;W[oj]C[ Gus: white is now pushig from behind... but this may be necessary to help his weak group.]
;B[pi];W[gq]
(;B[fc]C[ Gus: probably still better to attack white];W[hc]
C[ Gus: This is why approaching first is not so good, jumping into the corner gives white a solid group that will help his weak group. running out is also difficult]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[ce]
;B[be];W[fd];B[dg]C[Still better to attack white's weak group]
;W[kc];B[mc]C[ Gus: way too slow... approaching the bottom left would be better. This sort of extension is only good in the early end game, or in an emergency when you need to defend something. Any other time you should avoid it like the plague]
;W[cn]

(;W[dq]C[w is too timid *sigh*];B[ep];W[iq];B[jq];W[eo];B[gp]
;W[er];B[fq]C[This move was a mistake for me -_-  -JB

 Gus: yup, but then you makeit worse by running with the stones. right now you can only loose 3 stones]
;W[fr];B[fp];W[hp];B[go];W[ho];B[gn];W[hn];B[fm];W[dl];B[hm]
;W[ci]C[Perhaps the last two moves allowed white to get a a big advantage? -JB

 Gus: White is ahead by about 15 by my rough count...

White: 35
30 bottom left
10 top
15 bottom right
-20 for a weak group with no eyes

Black: 20
10 upper left
25 upper right
5 bottom side
-20 for weak group with no eyes];B[cj]LB[nh:A][ro:B]C[ Gus: It's a littel early to make a mess you still have some good moves that you want to get in such as o12. 

Even more importantly you are making a mess near your weak group which is very dangerous.]
;W[ck]C[ Gus: white gives you a gift by  letting you take the outside]
;B[dj];W[bj];B[di];W[ch];B[dh];W[cg];B[df];W[bl]C[ Gus: this is wonderful for you you are almost safe now with your wall so close]
;B[oi]C[attacking is a good idea, but peep first to ruin his shape, Your plan should be to chace white out and then cap around g, h or j 10 making your group safe while he runs]
