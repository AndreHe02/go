C[Namico = W
??? = B

It appears W resigned after 118.

My comments are "DS:"];B[qd];W[pp];B[cp]C[DS: This usually means B wants a fighting style of game.]
;W[dd];B[eq];W[oc]C[DS:  Ok, but D16 really wants to extend toward C10.  This is a move both sides want.]
;B[qg];W[qc]
(;B[cf]C[DS: Contact plays like R17 almost always demand a response.  In this case S17 is most logical.  See prev. var.]
N[real progress];W[fd];B[dk]C[DS: Ok, but a bit too thin here.  D10 better for rapid development, or just B16 calm.]
;W[jq];B[qn];W[mp]C[DS: The usual would be O4.];B[pk]C[DS:  Ok, But B could also play R3 to good effect.]

(;W[ch]C[DS: Hmm, not so good i think.  A pincer like this really should be played instead of playing F16.  With C12 this is too cramped.  A reducing move like D11 seems more playable.]
N[real progress];B[ef];W[id]C[DS: no, bad move now.  Also wrong place.  K17 would be the point that balances between P17 and F16. B could easily still invade H17, E17 or C17 without problems. C12 might do better by running out with E12.]
;B[eh]C[DS: Now W surrounded.];W[bf];B[ce]C[DS: Timid. How about B15?]
;W[cd];B[be];W[bg];B[cj]C[DS: Timid, but ok.  B11 seems vital point. W really can't escape unless B makes mistake.]
;W[bj];B[ci];W[bi];B[bk];W[ak]C[DS: At this point W is quite dead unless B makes a mistake.  B is clearly leading now.  Probably by about 30 points.]
;B[bl]
(;W[ld]C[DS: seems to be a single purpose move.  Try to find moves that do more than one thing.  ie create pincer and extention. Or attack while building thickness.  B is still very thin on the right.  As W is behind, it would be prudent to attack now.  R8 would carve out a nice part of the right side for W.]
N[Real progress];B[cg];W[af]C[DS: W dead. This is of no help.]
;B[dh]C[DS: Not needed.];W[bh];B[aj]C[DS: not needed.];W[ai]
;B[en];W[bd];B[ae];W[ad]C[DS: This is big, but an endgame move.  Not appropriate at this time. An invasion like R8 or B3 would be bigger moves for W now.]
;B[qq]C[DS: Good move.];W[pq];B[qp];W[ee]C[DS: too small.  This does nothing for W and does not attack B in anyway.  G3 bigger. Worth about 15 points.  Still could invade on the right side. But B is securly ahead now.]
;B[hq]C[DS: good. Big move.];W[ff]C[DS: again, small move. Doesn't help W or attack B.]
;B[eg]C[DS: unnecessary.];W[mm]C[DS: OK, but I would prefer something like Q14 or so. At least that would work with W's moyo at the top.]
;B[kn]C[DS: Ok, a bit loose, but enlarges B's left side while attacking W.  I guess this could be considered a dual purpose move.]
;W[ln]C[DS: Bad move, enemy helping.  This just helps B create a wall for his own left side.  K5 may be somewhat better.]
;B[ko];W[kp];B[io];W[ig];B[hh];W[lg];B[ji];W[mi];B[kk]C[DS: B enlarges his territory while W's stones at the top are not really enclosing anything much.  B has gained a lot here.]
;W[mk]C[DS: Bad move, connection not needed.  There really is little W can do now as B is so far ahead.]
;B[ib]C[DS: Too deep and really not needed as B is already so far ahead.  W Should be able to kill b here, but I think B at S17 or Q2 would be so much bigger.]

(;W[hb]C[DS: Ok, but I prefer just J17 for W.  Hard for B to do anything next. See var]

(;W[mb]C[DS: Unneeded move. S16, Q11 or cut at P14 may be playable.]
