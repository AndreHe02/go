C[Note from the reviewer:
As usual, I have tried to make my best during this review. Hope it will be useful for the players and may be to some other readers.

However, please don't take my comment for the only truth as it should be full of mistakes for the truth of a dan player, and only worst for the truth of a pro player.

;W[cn];B[co];W[ck]LB[dn:A][fp:B][cj:C][cq:D]C[too early. First play the exchange A for B then this move or one point further at C.

Later you can still invade at the san-san (D)];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm]
;W[bl];B[ci]C[This exchange is too good for black. Black has a good position in both corner.]
;W[cq]C[Seems feasible (thought I really don't know because I'm not very strong in the corner fights).

If it works, white will have a little corner and black should have a good influence on the bottom side and the 4 whites stones will be weaker.]
;B[dq];W[bp];B[bo]
(;W[cr]C[I have checked some variations with this move and they all failed. I think you could have a KO (see variation)]

LB[np:A]C[Black is too agressive. This seems too early to me. He should answer in the bottom corner (e.g. at A)]
;W[ec]LB[fc:A]C[bad shape. Try to avoid this kind of shape.
Play at A instead.];B[eb];W[fb];B[gc];W[gd];B[fc]C[you can see the effect of the bad shape.]

;W[ff];B[if];W[hf]C[Black should be very happy again. This exchange is very good for him.]
;B[nd];W[mc]LB[pf:A]C[The group on the left should live easily. Take position on the right side instead at A.]

LB[jp:A][jq:B]C[Too close. White should not play the contact in this case, this will strengthen black. He should play further at A or B and use the influence of the "wall" of marked stones.]

C[Not useful. You have many weak points and black is strong.
I would have played A to try to have a stronger influence in the center to give a bad time to the weak marked black group .]

;B[iq];W[kr];B[is]LB[ko:A]C[This is now again clearly better for Black (8 points for Black and nothing for white). Thought this last stone is very little point. It should have been played at A to give Black a better influence in the center. It will be needed when the time to save the group will come.]
;W[ek]LB[lj:A]C[Doubful. Are you trying to use your influence to make territory? Don't.
I would have played on the other side at A. However, a stronger white influence on the bottom side towards the center is now clearly missing.]
;B[gk]C[May be too far.];W[gl]C[Again, wrong direction. Press Black TOWARDS your influence and not the other way.]
;B[hl];W[gm];B[hm];W[jk]LB[hi:A]C[Too far (and too late). It's time to close fight. I would have played at A. The fight will be difficult.]

(;B[lm]LB[mm:A]C[Too late. The marked stones are lost. Black should play the threat at A instead (see variation).]
;W[mm];B[kl];W[ll]C[White answered correctly. The difference between this and the previous  variation is about 10 points in favor of white. White comes  back a little in the game, but is still behind (by at least 10 points) This is too much to hope to win during the yose.]
