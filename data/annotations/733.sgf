C[dfan: I was White in this game.  I would like advice especially on how I could have stopped Black from making his immense right-side territory, and on how I could have attacked the groups on the left more effectively.  Thanks!]

(;W[no]C[Once this W move is played there is litle choice for W so dfan's comment attached to move 13 is really a reflection on this move.  None of the variations shown are really much better in my opinion, although in some cases that could me a motter of preference.]
;B[pn];W[pr];B[qq]
(;W[kr]C[If W does not like this then he can always try something inventive like the variation should but I would be hesitant to do it myself.]
;B[nm]C[dfan: At this point I was already beginning to be very afraid of B's moyo.

SGF:  It is not that big yet. W has sente and so should be able to keep it under control.]
;W[jd]LB[kd:a][nc:b][mc:c][me:d][md:e]C[I would go one line further at 'a'.  This has a strong followup at 'b'.  If b plays 'c' to stop this then 'd' limits the moyo.]
;B[de]
(;W[ce]LB[fd:a][dd:b]C[This move feels wrong to me.  The variation starting at 'a' would help W nullify B's thickness on the right.  Also, this W allows B the option to play at 'b']
;B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc]C[This move mays W14 look out of place, thus emphasizing that W16 was the wrong direction.  W14 is now too close to W's thickness at 20.]
;B[cj]LB[dj:a]C[If B is playing for thickness 'a' would be better.]

(;W[nc]LB[pf:a][qf:b][qh:c]C[The W formation at the top has the feeling of a handicap game.  E14 is too far from either 20 or 22 to be a solid connection and so this is not a very secure shape. A Black response at 'a' give B more potential than W. W's overall formation is not good: W is out of place and the relationship between W4 and W12 is bad.  Maybe W shoudl try one of the variations at 'b' or 'c'.]

(;B[lc]LB[pf:a]C[dfan: This felt unreasonable.

SGF:  This is totally unnecessary.  'a' is sufficient  to continue building the moyo.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[ng];B[le];W[ph];B[og];W[oh];B[nh]
(;W[of]LB[mg:a]C[This is a bad move, removing a lot of the potential in the two W stones. After B connects W must play at 'a' so that move should just be played directly.]
;B[pg];W[mg];B[ni];W[li]LB[kg:a][mh:b]C['a' is better shape. This W36 is good for reducing the moyo but leaves behind the B cut at 'b'.If B makes this cut the relative strengths of the two groups at the top shifts.]
;B[oe]LB[pe:a][me:b]C[dfan: In retrospect I think I should have played Q15 and not let B play here, but I was afraid of gote.

SGF:  'a'  would have just forced B to protect twe corner and so would have been aji keshi.  There is nothing to worry about in this B37. Answering at 'b' helps W more than B]
;W[nd]C[dfan: Better at N15?
SGF: Yes, N15 is much better shape as it  make a solid connection and puts more pressure on B]
;B[nf];W[mf];B[me]C[This not a pleasant ko for W as even if he wins it there is no effect on the corner, whereas if B wins the W stones are probably in big trouble.]
;W[of];B[lh]C[I don't like this move as it really doesn't theaten much.  If W connects the three black stones at the top are still very weak.  cutting off W36 really achieves nothing because if b wins the ko he can chase W's 4 stones after having captured the 3 at the top.]
;W[nf];B[kh];W[kf];B[lf];W[lg];B[kg];W[je]LB[ke:a][ld:b][mc:c]
[jf:d]C[dfan: I played this without thinking, I'm sure it should be at L15 instead.

SGF. If Wa then B can only play at 'b' or 'c' and it seems highly unlikely that either move would save B. this move fails to fill a liberty and this cold be crucial in the ensuing fight.  Also, 'd', not 50, is the correct  shape if the B stones are ignored]
;B[mc];W[pb]LB[nb:a][qc:b][kb:c]C['a' would make miai of 'b' and 'c' and W would have no problems.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pc]C[W needs to be careful - he is filling his own liberties.]
;B[qd];W[mb];B[lb];W[na]LB[nb:a][oa:b][jb:c]C['a' is better shape. B has to play against this group to stop two eyes and (by a play at 'b') so W gets 'c' and wins the fight.]
;B[ob];W[nb];B[qa]
(;W[oc]LB[jb:a]C[This is a dangerous move. There is no way t oget two eyes so if B runs to the left these stones way very well die.  W can get a sente seki by playing at 'a' (see variation) and probably should do so.]
;B[jb];W[ld];B[md];W[kc];B[kd]LB[jc:a][kb:b][ib:c]C[Forcing W to play 'a' weakens B's shape.  Keeping this capture in reserve and playing at 'b' is better.  If B plays 'b' now W cannot answer at 'c'.  Once Wa os played be can block there.]
;W[jc];B[ke];W[jf];B[ib];W[kb];B[ka];W[la]C[W has got this ko because of the mistiming of B69]
;B[ma];W[mh];B[la];W[ja]C[This can be played anytime.  It may even prove to be bad.  Better too leave it till later.  B is not going to paly here.]
;B[ia];W[mi];B[hd];W[he]LB[ji:a][qh:b][qf:c][qj:d][nj:e][pk:f]
C[W has had a lucky escape but is still behind.  At all cost W must not let B connect the top group with the left side otherwise the game is probably not savable.  Too this end, W84 cannot be right as it forced B to go where he wants.  there is not direct way to do this so just playing at 'a' to capture the 3 stones and secure  the W group is a judicious way to play.  B needs another stone to connect his groups together and he may not want t otake gote to do it.  'b' is a big point to aim ot  on the right, becasue it makes miai of 'c' followed by 'd' and 'e' followed by 'f'.  If B takes to time to play on the left he could find himself in trouble on the right.]
;B[gd];W[fd];B[ge];W[ji]C[As stated ealier the exchange of 84-87 only help B]
;B[cn]
(;W[fe]LB[qh:a]C[There is very little cahnce of killing B so threatening from the outside is a better approach which might result in a large central territory.  However, the play at 'a' is a huge point.  See the variations.]
;B[gf];W[ff];B[gh];W[jg]LB[gb:a][qh:b][fg:c][gg:d][cl:e]C[I don't understand this.  It is not necessary. 'a' is sente for W and makes an eye for B so this is a key point which cannot be missed.  W clearly has not seen 'b', which is big so, ignoring that possibility we have to assume that after 'a' W's only chance is to make a big territory at the bottom or to start a big fight and hope that something happens. I would try invading at 'e ' after exchanging 'c' for 'd'.]
;B[fg];W[eg];B[eh];W[fi];B[fh]LB[ef:a]C[play at 'a' first];W[fq]
LB[cl:a][dn:b]C[w needs more than this.  The previous sequence made 'a' impossible so now W needs a big territory at the bottom.  This is not enough.  I would lean at 'b' and hope to get sente to attack B7]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[bq];W[br]C[Miniscule in the overall picture.]
;B[hq]LB[ho:a][dn:b][mm:c]C[W has to attack B7 and B105 severely.  It has very little chance of succeeding but I would play at 'a', keeping moves like 'b' and 'c' in reserve.]
;W[en];B[gr];W[fr];B[kq];W[lr];B[nj]LB[qh:a]C[w's last chance to play 'a' in now gone]
;W[qr]LB[jq:a][jp:b][ip:c]C[W does not have time for this.. He must attack the bottom group with Wa, Bb, Wc.]
