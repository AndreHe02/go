C[Comments by Azazel, bixbyr@umail.ucsb.edu];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq]
;W[dc];B[ep];W[ip];B[dn]LB[en:a]C[This is an alright move, but it asks for complications. The jump to 'a' would also work if black wants to keep things simple. The keima asks to be cut ;)]
;W[eq]C[Weak move by white. The j4 pincer stone sufferes in this varation and d6 is placed to block the extension of white's corner. If W wants to play this way, exchanging J4 and D6 was bad. Black should hane at f3 to keep W seperated, see var]

(;B[dq];W[dp];B[fq];W[er];B[fp];W[dr]C[This way W has more aji, so less severe. See var for another possible sequence (this would not be the only possibility, just one idea)]

(;B[cn]C[Was wondering if this move was to little. can expand moyou more?

Az: This is a very slow move. Black should either attack the j4 stone or the upper left corner to build a framework, this is small]
;W[hq];B[dj]C[Once again, too slow. White doesn't have to answer this move, and though it's nice to have played, it's not the most urgent point on the board. Attack the upper left, then falling back is a more efficent way to make an extension]
;W[lq];B[qo];W[dh];B[de]C[Very agressive move, though perhaps D10 warrants it.]
;W[cc]LB[ef:a]C[Don't know if this is the best move for white but took advantage of it.

Az: It was a slow move for white, black should sieze the iniative by playing 'a'. 'a' prevents white from connecting his stones up and launches an attack on D12]
;B[ff];W[be]LB[cf:a][bf:b][cg:c]C['a' is B's natural followup. F14 is slightly misplaced, but with 'a' the position would be playable for black. If white wnats to continue at 'b', extend to 'c' and say thank you]
;B[cg]C[Bad shape (for both players)];W[ch];B[bf]LB[cf:a]C[Very bad shape. 'a' is also bad shape, but at least it would be better]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[eg];B[ef];W[cj];B[ck];W[bj];B[di];W[ci]LB[bk:a]
C[Black should play 'a' next to attack white. White is not alive yet. Playing D13 lacks fighting spirit]
;B[dg];W[ei];B[ej];W[fi];B[fg];W[eh];B[jd]LB[bk:a]C[Too far out from thickness or wrong spot?

Az: Wrong spot I think. I would prefere 'a', since after that white has to run and you can play this move while you chase white]
;W[gc];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[hc];W[gd];B[hb];W[fd]LB[he:a]
C[This is a little iffy since it is hard to link all of black's stones up and black is potentially in danger of a splitting attack around 'a']
;B[if];W[fj]LB[dl:a]C['a' is the shape move for black, E9 is clumsy]
;B[ek];W[fk];B[el];W[bk];B[fl]C[This doesn't make sense, since it allows white to live in what was once black's area with no compensation]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[bm];B[bo];W[bp];B[hl]C[Now must rush out to center to make shape HELLLP!! :)

Az: This is a good move for moving out into the center, but the real mistake has been to let the situation get to this point]
;W[bn]C[Observing game 77 (oy1234 vs. TomL) :
Found 0 observer.];B[qf];W[gm];B[gl];W[go]LB[fn:a]C['a' is black's best response from a shape perspective]
;B[do];W[co];B[hm];W[fo];B[eo];W[hn];B[hj]C[didn't want w to expand on teh bottom by playing a move in teh vicinity of l8 so though would threaten to close him in while tryign to build nice shape.

Az: This is ok];W[gh]C[See var for a better way of protecting]

(;B[ih];W[hg];B[hf];W[ig]C[Black was too afraid, see variation]

(;B[gg];W[hh];B[ii]C[obvisoly took wrong pathin a fear that a stronger player was going to cut me.]
;W[jg]LB[pj:a]C[Painful, this undoes most of what black gained. Still, black doesn't have to defend immediately, a move like 'a' would be huge, and it would be hard to white to close black in]
;B[kk];W[ld]LB[ke:a]C[This is too deep for white, black should response sharply with 'a' to keep white from linking up]
;B[nd];W[kd]LB[je:a]C['a' is a must next, a hane is too weak]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[kb];W[je];B[hd];W[kf];B[mb];W[lb]C[Black is being timid, see variation]

[qm:b]C['a' is better than 'b' since it cuts on a larger scale, see variation]
