C[Hi! I play black here. I won because W missed a connection but the game would have been really close otherwise. I think it was actually slightly in W's favor near the end.]
;B[dd];W[dp];B[pq];W[pd];B[qf];W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[qe];W[qd]
;B[qk];W[ld];B[cn];W[ck]C[Perhaps I should have simply invaded here?

*** I think what you did was reasonable.];B[en];W[cp]C[Very odd and slow move I think...]
;B[fp]C[I was really hoping he'd cut.];W[fq];B[gp]C[*** I think a hane here has a lot of value since it works so well with what you already have on the right side.  I believe G3 works, but a hane could also be done on a later move as well.]
;W[gq];B[hp];W[ep]LB[dd:a]TR[ek]C[Perhaps I should have capped to gain some center influence? I was kind of worried about the lone stone in the corner at A.

*** I worry about the cut around F5.  A cap looks like a good way to reduce the impact of that and works nicely with what you already have on the right side.  I don't think the corner at A is too much of a concern at the moment since white is a bit thin on both sides.]
;B[ci];W[ek];B[ei]C[*** This may be too aggressive.  There may be enough aji for white to threaten the E6 group.  I believe L7 would be a good follow up for white here.]
;W[gk];B[fl];W[el];B[em];W[fk];B[hm];W[pn];B[gi]C[*** I like J9 instead.  It should eliminate the potential for white's groups to connect and is likely to help solidify your upper left corner.  It also gives one more way to gain territory while torturing white's stone at Q6]
;W[ik]LB[pn:a];B[og]LB[og:a]C[Not sure  what I was hoping for here. I should have attacked the two groups immediately]
;W[nn];B[kk]C[*** This might be an overplay.  You can block the connection between the groups but at the cost of enclosing the F5 group]

;W[pl];B[qj];W[qm];B[qo];W[rn];B[ro]LB[hq:a]C[Bad move, a move around A was definitely more important.

*** While 'a' is pretty big, I believe the top is bigger.];W[ir]
C[W got it first];B[om];W[pm];B[kj];W[mk];B[ll];W[pj];B[qi]
;W[mi];B[jd]C[Over extension, but I was hoping to separate them while creating some aji in his corner.

*** Did you expect to kill a group?  If you succeed in separating them, white will be invading your territory and the whole game may be in the balance.  You could go the opposite route and encourage the J9 group to run to the upper right corner while solidifying your moyo in the corner.]
;W[hd];B[hf]C[I was hoping he'd take the bait :)];W[fh];B[fi]
;W[hg];B[hh]TR[if]C[Looking at this now, this move would have been much more severe.]

;W[rc];B[re];W[qb];B[ic];W[kf];B[hc]C[Maybe I need to work on my reading a bit, I think B can tenuki here. b99 is slow.

*** I'm not sure if you can tenuki.  Your F11 group and corner are both quite weak.  If you tenuki out of the area, something may die.  I'm not sure if the F11 group can surive at this point.]
