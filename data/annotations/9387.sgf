C[I was experimenting with a sansan opening in this game (I typically play mini or micro Chinese).  My opponent made a mistake in joseki at move 10 that gave me a huge lead.  I made a few mistakes throughout the game that gave the lead back, and should have lost the game by 2.5.  However, a last minute mistake by my opponent swapped the result.

I think this is an important game to review, as I feel I should have done much better with the lead I had.  In particular, I managed to make very little out of the massive wall facing W's bottom left.  I tried to identify all the mistakes I could, but I would love to know how you would have approached certain important decision points.]

(;B[lm]TR[or]C[Given that I have two weak groups I thought he could probably live.  Since the bottom group can be invaded from P2 I decided to push from that side.  How would you attack these stones?]
;W[mn];B[ln];W[lo];B[lp];W[mp];B[ko];W[mo];B[kp];W[ml]C[After the previous exchange I thought I could probably kill him, since my bottom group is much more solid.  Perhaps my push-through-cut was too early?]
;B[mm];W[nm];B[nl];W[ol];B[nk];W[om];B[ok]SQ[qj]C[I played through some variations on this move, and this seems to be a mistake.  R10 allows me to keep fighting for much longer while gaining territory.]
;W[pl]
(;B[ql]C[I'm sure you know that pushing from behind is bad. Whenever you find yourself looking at a move that does this you should spend a bit of time to see if an alternate exists. The jump to R9 should be easy for someone of your strength to find.]

(;B[lk]C[Since I was alive on the right I played honte here.  I probably didn't get as much as I could have out of W's weak group, but I do have a lot of influence toward the left.]

C[Surprising non-atari here.];B[me];W[mf];B[of];W[pe]
(;B[lf];W[og]
(;B[mg]C[A bad atari. Just makes W stronger.

There are actually 3 questions you should ask to determine if  you should play atari. 
1. Can you capture the stones (here you cannot)
2. Would it prevent your oppenent from playing a large move at that point (in this case who cares if W plays here)
3. Do you have to come back and connect (here you need to connect at M13 to keep N13 so best not to play it.]
;W[ng];B[ld];W[lg];B[kf]C[Good! You didn't give atari.];W[mh]
C[A very good result for B.  I think this makes up for what I failed to gain in the initial fight.

Here personally I would focus on the left side.]
(;B[ee];W[dd];B[ed];W[cc];B[ec];W[cb]C[I feel it was strange for W to allow me this wall.  Now how does he deal with my territory at top?]
;B[df];W[ef];B[cf];W[cd]
(;B[ff]C[Wrong side. Also more or less violates the 3 laws and after W extends your weakest stones (on the left) are even weaker.]
;W[eg];B[ci]SQ[cn][fq]C[Looking back this seems like a big mistake.  Now I have to defend this group rather than use it as aji.  If I had played around the hoshi stone I think I would have been much better off.  This perhaps gave W the opening to get back in.]
;W[fg];B[gf];W[gg];B[hf];W[ck]
(;B[ej]LB[di:A]C[Now you have always to read so carefully on the aji of the cut at A.]

;W[fi];B[fh];W[gh];B[gi];W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[hh]C[Good reading, but wrong direction. W played well by sacrificing his weak stones to gain the lower left side.]
;W[gk]
(;B[hi]C[I thought this was enough to keep me ahead, but now how to I deal with W's moyo?  This is probably the best result I can expect after playing C11 though..]
;W[kr];B[jq];W[jr];B[lq];W[iq];B[fq]SQ[io][cq]C[Another mistake.  I didn't see that J4 is sente for W (or verrry risky for B), so I was aiming either at the corner or J5.  Obviously I should have just played J5 directly since he shouldn't give me the corner anyway.]

I'm surprised how much I lost after just a few mistakes.  But W did seem to play very well after his early mistake in joseki and the odd choice at 82.  I look forward to your thoughts.]

You have no real weaknesses. Mabye the W stone at N8 but it will be hard for W to activate it being as it is so weak itself.

W has a too big to fail group. He has to run and you should be able to wrap up the right side and come away with sente.
