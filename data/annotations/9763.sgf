C[Jonahx - Excellent game by you that showed a lot of good thinking. Your comments and questions also show a lot of good thought high above your current level. Once you clean up a few basic mistakes in your game you should improve greatly.



Hi there, and thank you very much for reviewing my game. I've asked quite a lot of questions throughout the game, I hope there aren't too many! I look forward to reading your responses :)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jp];W[jd];B[pj];W[dj]LB[cn:B][dn:A]
TR[jd]C[Jonahx - This is okay - not really a big deal, especially at this level, but yes as white you can't be quite so passive in the opening and let black do whatever he wants. Still, these moves are fine. A or B are both good possibilities for either marked stone.


This is certainly not my usual style of play, but I guess I kind of felt like playing a bit of mirror go. This probably wasn't a good idea against a sanrensei formation as, being white, it was always gonna be up to me to invade the big framework first. Should I have maybe approached at A now instead? Or even have done that instead of playing the marked stone?]
;B[jj]C[Jonahx - I think in this situation this actually is a good move - maybe not ideal - but it both increases the size of black's space and decreases the size of yours. Tengen is a strange move that it's hard to play with (partly because we study it so infrequently) and can be quite effective when someone is planning for the center or a large moyo.



Is this a good move? I see that he was trying to expand his framework, but playing tengen in the opening just looks so unnatural to me that when he played it I was actually kind of amused.]
;W[cn];B[mm]LB[gp:B][qq:A]C[Jonahx - This, however, is not a good move - black is essentailly plaing inside his own territory. You don't need to be "scared" of that framework - it's solid, but the center is smallish, and it is still possible to invade around the side or in the corner, at A as you suggest. A and B are both fine moves.




Once again, I can see what he's trying to do but I've never encountered this kind of play before, seemed so bizarre that I didnt really know how to react. Should I have been scared of this framework and jumped in at A now? Or was I right to invade at B?]
;W[gp];B[dn];W[dm];B[do];W[co];B[gq];W[fq];B[fp];W[eq];B[ep]

(;W[cq]LB[dq:A]C[Jonahx - This is too much, as you'll see - better at A.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[cp];W[bp]C[This is a dangerous position to be in because you have so many cutting points]

(;B[fr];W[er];B[go];W[gr];B[hp];W[hq];B[gp];W[iq];B[ip];W[df]
LB[cc:A][cd:B][ce:C][jj:1]TR[dd][jd][dj]C[Jonahx - Not a great move - you already have a "double wing" formation with the triangled stones. Black 1 is pressing into that outward influance, so you should focus on solidifying the sides. The game move protects the left side a little bit, but should be on the 3rd line, since you have so many stones on the 4th line already, and the center is not a huge potential for you. Better yet would be protecting against the 3-3 invasion at A as you say. B or C would be good ways to do that too.



Is this too slow? I felt like I was already ahead in this game and that it might be shrewd to make an enclosure and take the double wing formation, though it does invite the invasion at A]
;B[jq];W[ir];B[hm]CR[fj][fk][em]C[Jonahx - I'm not sure either - not a very good move. It protects the center territory yet, but any of the marked moves would serve the same purpose better.

Not sure what the idea was behind this];W[qn]LB[cc:A][pc:2]
[qc:D][qd:1][pf:C][jg:B][qg:3][mq:E][nq:F]TR[hq][iq][ir]SQ[jr]
C[B - This is a great moment to pause and look at the board. It's good to pause every once and a while and just assess the situation. White has a large area on the top and left, with potential for some territory on the right and center, but is relitively wide open. Black has the lower right corner and nothing else, and is still open to invasion.

So thinking about it that way, your only job at this point is to solidify your lead and territory. You mentioned playing close to strength so  remember you also shouldn't play close to your own strength. A would make you too over concentrated. D is okay, but I would prefer 1 or 2. C is okay, but would be better at 3 (think of the 4th line as center-oriented. At this point the center is contested and it's easier to make territory on the side or corner with 1,2, or 3.) B is okay, but the other moves are better.

That said, an invasion into black's territory is possible and fine since you have such a large lead you can do whatever you want really.

Your move is the correct side, just looking at it there's more space there. It would actually be hard to connect since black can force at the squared space.

Even better would be just jumping in at the 3-3 point.




Now I feel like this may have been greedy, should I have just played it safe and built my topside territory with a move like A, B, C or D? Is this the right direction to have approached from? Now I'm thinking a move at E or F threatens to take the corner and to link up to the marked stones on the bottom, but at the time it felt a little too close to black's thickness]
;B[jr]
(;W[hs]TR[hq][iq][ir]C[B - Well, some of those stones are alive, but black could capture the triangled ones (see variations). You're in further trouble because black can cut at the previously mentioned points. But, in the grand scale, invading at the 3-3 point or around there would be bigger than giving up those 3 stones anyways.


Now I think I should have ignored black, since these stones are already alive, and just taken his corner]
;B[js];W[is];B[qq];W[rk];B[pn];W[pm]LB[qm:A]C[B - It's often better to respond to an attachment with an extension (at A, here), which makes it more difficult for your attacker.]
;B[on];W[om];B[nm];W[qi];B[nk]C[B - Another pretty useless move into black's own territory]
;W[oi];B[ok];W[oj]LB[pk:A]C[B - Not sure what your thinking is here. It worked out for you and you captured a stone (not worth that much) but black should have just connected at A, and you would only have succeded in making him thicker.]

(;B[nj];W[pk];B[fj];W[ei];B[ej]
(;W[fi]LB[di:A]C[Jonahx - This is a sequence that comes up more than once for you. Try to shy away from this and start connecting solidly at A. The empty triangle is often bad, but the full triangle is often as good. When your opponent cuts at A  it can cause problems.]

(;B[gi]
(;W[gj]C[Jonahx - Not sure what your plan is here. When you're ahead you should seek to keep the game simple, you don't need to cause complications by cutitng or trying to capture small points. Look at what you're fencing off compared to what black is fencing off. That's the kind of unequal exchange you should seek to make at every point.]
;B[gk];W[hj];B[hk];W[hi];B[ij];W[fk];B[ek];W[fl];B[el]
(;W[em]LB[fm:A]TR[ej][fj][ek][el]SQ[fk][fl]C[Jonahx - Black can capture your squared stones no matter what you do.(See variations)


This was a mistake, if I had pushed at A and increased my liberty count I think I could have captured the marked stones]
;B[fm];W[gl];B[gm];W[dk];B[hl];W[gh];B[jf];W[le]C[Jonahx - Not sure what you mean. First off, this move blocks off the right, this potentially pushing him left. Secondly however, you have no weak groups. In fact, all of your groups are more or less connected at the moment, and any of them, if seperated, either have two eyes or plenty of room to make them. Regardless, this move protects the largest area, so that's good.



Trying to nudge him towards my stronger group and hopefully strengthen my weak group on the left in the process]
;B[lf];W[kf]LB[me:A][mf:B]C[Jonahx - Again, no need to make things complicated or be agressive. You have a large lead. A or B would be better.]
;B[kg];W[ke];B[mg]
(;W[jg]LB[mf:A][lg:B]C[Jonahx - Be careful about thinking moves are "forcing." Letting you capture a stone is not a big problem for black, responding elsewhere would also be better for black. Even if black responds at B, you've made him stronger. Don't play forving moves just because you can, even if they are actually forcing.


Should probably have played the forcing move at A first];B[jh]
;W[ig];B[lg];W[kh];B[ih];W[hh];B[ki]C[Jonahx - Unnecessary]
;W[lh];B[mh];W[mi]
(;B[li];W[ni];B[mj];W[nf];B[ng];W[og];B[mf];W[me]C[Jonahx - Again, be careful setting up cutting points like this, black missed an oportunity.]

(;B[ne];W[of];B[qo];W[rn];B[ro];W[nd]C[Jonahx - Unnecessary]
;B[pl];W[qk];B[qm];W[ql];B[ol];W[rm];B[pm];W[pi]C[Jonahx - I can understand the feeling of just not wanting to have to think about it anymore, but this is truly safe, any time you have a stone surrounded like this you're in very good shape.



I know this was unnecessary looking back but that stone made me uneasy for some reason and I just wanted rid of the aji]
;B[jc]C[Jonahx - This is the problem with having no stones below the 4th line, it's often possible for an invasion like this to live or cause trouble.


This invasion seemed way too deep but he ended up living. Looking at it now I think this might have been a probing move to figure out which 3-3 point to invade at. He ended up doing both :)]
;W[ic];B[cc]C[Jonahx - This invasion can live unconditionally - though because you have such strength on the outside, it may be possible to kill by pushing it outside with a move at D18. Regardless, simply sealing black in the corner leaves you ahead by quite a bit.]

(;W[dc]
(;B[cd];W[ce]
(;B[be]
(;W[cb];B[bb];W[db]C[Jonahx - this is a joseki, but playing this way leaves the left side open, and is inferior to the bland, vanilla, response to the 3-3 invasion.]
;B[ca];W[da];B[ac]
(;W[ba]
(;B[ae]LB[bf:A]C[Jonahx - Many more possibilities at A, might be able to live.]
;W[bf];B[af];W[bd];B[bg];W[bc];B[cf];W[cg];B[bh];W[ci];B[ch]
;W[dg];B[bi];W[bj];B[aj]
(;W[ak]C[Jonahx - In general don't block on the first line - just keep extending on the 2nd line. There's no way black can make more eye space, but doing this just leaves more ko threats.]
;B[ai];W[ck];B[al];W[bk];B[ag];W[ad];B[dh];W[eh];B[dl];W[cl]
;B[en];W[cm];B[so];W[br]C[Jonahx - Finally!];B[qc];W[qd];B[pc]
;W[oc];B[rd];W[re];B[sc];W[rb];B[rc]
(;W[qb];B[pb];W[pa];B[ob];W[nb];B[oa];W[na];B[qa];W[ra]C[Jonahx - Again, the 3-3 invasion should be able to live unconditionally as before, unless you push it outside somehow.  You're still ahead by some 50 points, even if you let it live though.

Once black plays at T 17 you should be able to kill, I think.



I took this to ko, even though he has more threats than me, and it came back to bite me. Was there an easy way for me to have killed this? Looks like there should have been]
;B[hc]
(;W[hd]LB[ib:A]C[B - Yes. What's the worst that happens? Play around and see. (Hint, nothing)



Should I have just played at A and split his stones in half?]
;B[ib];W[id];B[kb];W[kc];B[jb];W[gc];B[hb];W[gb];B[lc];W[kd]
;B[mc];W[nc];B[mb];W[ma];B[la];W[ha];B[ia]
(;W[ka]LB[ga:A][lb:1]C[Jonahx - This group is dead anyways, you don't need to play at A or L19 anywhere else because 1 is a false eye.



Should have connected at A and killed the group, silly mistake]
;B[ga];W[lb];B[se];W[sf]LB[rf:A]C[Jonahx - Again, better just to play at A]
;B[la];W[fk];B[ja]LB[sd:A]TR[fk]C[This wasn't a particularly good trade for me, but I thought it was pretty much my only threat. Now thinking I should have played the marked stone at A and tried to take my corner back]

;W[sf];B[od];W[oe];B[sg];W[pd];B[qd];W[sf];B[re];W[od];B[pf]
;W[qg];B[sg];W[rh];B[sf];W[pg]C[Jonahx - That about sums it up : ).


That was just a mess, all got very confusing, and ended up giving black's corner group a real eye, making my ko unplayable. I still tried though :)]
;B[gd];W[ge]SQ[gb][gc]C[Jonahx - In these kinds of situations (where your opponent is trying to live deep in your territory) look at the cutting stone and think about what it endangers or if you need to capture it. Often their groups don't have enough space to make another eye, so you just have to keep your stones safe. Even if you let that black stone run away, as long as you connect the two marked stones, black can't make life.]
;B[fd]
(;W[fc]LB[eb:A][ec:B]C[Jonahx - A doesn't do it, but B would, or even better, having played there a couple moves ago.


Silly mistake. Should have played at A or B];B[ec];W[fb];B[eb]
;W[ed];B[fa]C[At this point black has actually taken the lead, and it was clear to me this was going to be a close match.]
;W[fe];B[fc];W[gb]C[Clutching at straws, should have accepted this was alive.]
;B[ea];W[nh];B[if];W[hg];B[hf];W[gf]C[Jonahx - Unnecessary. If the score is close you really need to make sure every move is necessary.]
;B[ii];W[sn];B[di];W[cj];B[tt]C[Black passed, I also figured that it was pretty done, but I was worried that black might still be in the lead (indeed the score estimator gives him a half point lead) so I decided it was time to fight the hopeless ko in the top right]
;W[pa];B[cd];W[ab];B[qa];W[de];B[sb];W[tt]C[I passed...];B[sa]
C[And black gave the game away by playing an unnecessary move in his own territory. I won by half a point, due to a very silly final move by black, and I had felt early on that I was taking a substantial lead. Aside from the obvious mistakes, what did I do wrong to let black eat into that lead and take it from me? Thank you again for reviewing my game, it is much appreciated and I look forward to receiving your advice.]
;W[tt]C[Hey, a win's a win. You played much better for most of the game.

I would review the 3-3 invasion pages on senseis library thoroughly.
http://senseis.xmp.net/?33PointInvasion

Aside from that, remember to balance your stones between the 3rd and 4th lines, and play a little more solidly (leave fewer cutting points and defects) especially when leading. And if you do play on the 4-4 points, do remember you need to protect them from invasion at the 3-3 point eventually by playing there yourself or extending from them. Doing so feels slow and like a wasted move, but it's quite powerful at the right moment.

Excellent thoughts, keep playing and you'll reach single digit kyu in no-time!]
