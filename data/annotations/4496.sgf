C[
omgwtf (white): Hello. I am most interested in which parts of my game are the weakest (for a 17 kyu), and thus what I should study further by way of books or problems.. Also, I would be thankful if you pointed out any egregious errors I might have made which my opponent failed to take advantage of (and possibly how he might have taken advantage of them?).

Thanks in advance.

The problem that I saw repeatedly in this game is that neither player seemed to be looking at the whole board. Both players make many small moves, often in response to a small move, when there were HUGE moves available on the board. At several points in the game, those moves would have settled the game one way or another. 

When you play a move that could cost your opponent a few points do not expect them to immediately reply, especially if they can make more points elsewhere, perhaps points that you could also have taken. In order to play this way you need to count. You need to have an idea of what you can gain and what you can lose. You also need to consider that equation from your opponents perspective.

You should try to be patient when you play. Black's fuseki was, IMHO, better because his moves were solid and his stones worked together. White was not as patient and there were several moments in the game where black could have easily won. To a lesser extent, the reverse was also true of course. However, black's fuseki put him in a pretty comfortable position, and if he'd taken advantage of it he could have wrapped up the game easily.

My advice to the white player in this game is to think more about the whole board, to analyse the game. Your tactical skills are ok. But what seems to be weakening your game most is not seeing where the important regions are and playing accordingly. Some people will tell you that you should not bother counting at your level. I disagree. There is no better time to start. Your counting does not need to be terribly accurate, but you should practice. Also, if you take the time to count, you will also take more time to play your moves. That forced patience will often result in significantly better play.


Good luck!

R8 is fine. A is kind of timid and small. B is a mistake (you should not play a shoulder-hit unless you really have to), and C gives black the opportunity to strengthen the right at whites expense. Also, C does not really force black to respond. However, you also don't want to have you group shut in the corner.]

O7 is a nice point. Black would also like it. I think it is better than N7.]
;B[fq];W[dm]C[omgwtf: White senses that black's fuseki is unsure, defensive; preferring to strengthen his own rather than invade or reduce. Consequently, white plays more ambitiously.

--

Blacks fuseki is fine. His stones are strong and he has the potential for a large moyo in the top-right. IMO, D7 is bad shape. I would prefer D6.]

W = 46 + 0.5
B = 44

I've given black the top corner, although white can invade at the 3-3,  because if that happens black can easily convert the resulting thickness into profit, which should be at least equal to the points i've given him in the corner.

D3 is definitely big. However, I would be concerned about the top. The score is close, as you can see, and where are the bulk of the remaining points?]

Black opts for a reduction. Not a bad move. I would prefer to develop the top.]

Yes. White and black are playing very small moves. Black has huge potential and neither player is doing anything about it.]

Too small. Black has isolated one of white groups in the middle. He should try to exploit it. It is probably too much to hope to capture the white stones, but black can harrass them and at the same time convert the moyo on the top into solid territory.]
