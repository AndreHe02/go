AB[pp][dp][dd][pd][jj]C[Hello ,
I'm Thierry
The game is play in real and in the same time register in SGF file .

PLayers :
Vincent (20 kyu) vs Thierry (25 Kyu) .

This game is play with a 5 stones handicap .

The result was B +37.5

Hi Maes. My name is Rex Santoro. I play mostly on turn-based servers (Dragon, Online-go, Little Golem, and Its Your Turn. As an aside, Dragon and Online-go are very good places to play and learn go. I recommend both.) On Dragon, my rank is 9k.

I was a little surprised you asked for a review since you won by quite a lot. I will go ahead and answer your questions as best as I can. My comments will be preceeded by RS.]
;W[dm]C[RS: If you like reading books about go, I can highly recommend "The Elementary Go Series, Handicap Go" very much. In the book, they say you should try and take other handicap points (d10, k4, q10, k16) as soon as possible. In this way, you turn a 5-stone handicap game into a 6-stone game, and if you can more.]

(;B[cn];W[dj]C[RS: The variation could be another idea.]
(;B[df];W[fp];B[eq];W[fq]C[Instead of f2 as you did, you could have played e2.]

(;B[fr];W[gr];B[dr]C[I saw you play this a few times. I believe e2, the solid connection, is much better]
;W[jp]
(;B[mp];W[pm];B[qn];W[qm];B[rm];W[rl];B[ro];W[pg]C[I think that R8 is beter ?

RS: Yes, defintely. W's extension is too large, and his 3-stone wall is not very strong.]
;B[qf]C[In place of this move I think there is something to do on R8 but I don't no what ??

RS: This move was ok since it strengthens your corner, and almost any move W will make will not help his group very much.]

(;W[pj]C[RS: Even after Wq10, you can still take away W's base with B or C. See variations.]

(;B[md]MA[rh]C[RS: This is not bad, but even a jump to x would have scared W.]
;W[ld]C[RS: Instead of m17, you could have tried n17. See variation  for the continuation.]

(;B[lc];W[kd];B[kc];W[jc]C[RS: B looks better.]
(;B[jd]C[RS: ?? Be very careful when fighting someone 5 stones stronger then you. If I were playing, I would never fight like this. 5 stones is a lot.]

(;W[hf]
(;B[fd]C[bad move . It's beter to do H13 ?

RS: Well, this little sequence worked out for you because you had the chance to capture W at move 54, so, no, h13 is not better.]

RS: Unfortunately not. Draw a line between the 2 marked W stones. The Be14 group is stongly behind this line which means B will be enclosed by W.]

Maes, I hope this was helpful. If you have any questions, please ask.]
