here is the game.  I am black, of course.];B[pd];W[pp];B[dc]

far.  But the next move...];B[qk]LB[pj:a][pn:b][qo:c]C[This move is too conservative.  He can expose it by playing at
a, forcing you to be overconcentrated when you reply at b.

It would be better at c.];W[nc];B[kd]C[Good pincer.  He asked for that one.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[pg]C[Good move.  You didn't have to respond ot his
move at r18, and
you didn't.];W[kb]
(;B[hd]LB[jc:a]C[I suppose I should have pressed here.

Yes, this move was way too passive.  A move at a is standard.]
;W[ic]LB[id:a]C[You need to play at a, you don't want to be cut here, that's
awful.];B[hc];W[hb]LB[id:a]C[His mistake, he should have played at a, cutting your
stone off
from its neighbors.];B[cj]LB[id:a]C[I figure this exchange, leaving the side open, is
more beneficial
for me.

No, the move a is essential.   It is also sente, if white doesn't want to be
cut off.];W[cl];B[iq]C[Good invasion point.  You can go either direction with the
stone.];W[qo];B[pn];W[ro]
(;B[lq]LB[fq:a]C[Is this a mistake? I figured it would force g3?


There is no need for this move.  And you don't want to force g3, that builds
a moyo for him  If you have to move at all on the bottom it should be at a.
But the top is more important.];W[id];B[he];W[ie];B[ne];W[qi]
C[This
invasion is my big problem Is this game.  Is there a better
way to handle it?];B[qh];W[pi];B[ok]C[This looks good so far.  The white group has no
base.];W[oi]C[This is a horrible move for white.  He is making himself
heavy.];B[mk]LB[nj:a]C[I would have move at a if I were you.  Force him into your
wall.];W[mi]C[You let him jump away instead.];B[kf]C[Good...]
;W[ki];B[hg];W[gb];B[fd];W[ch]C[This one too.];B[dh]LB[di:a]
C[This is a move you make if you aren't very strong in this
area.  You are strong, so the correct move is at a.  (See Get Strong at
Invading).  By playing in contact with him, you make him stronger.]

bad.  He now connects.  You have two choices to stop him from connecting
here.... a or b.];W[jb];B[lc];W[la];B[ij]C[remember, contact moves make
white strong.];W[jk];B[im];W[jm];B[il];W[jl];B[lm];W[in];B[ik]

how to stop him from connecting..];W[sk];B[jo]C[I figure this was pretty

to give away sente.];W[jn];B[mc];W[nb];B[ji];W[lj];B[ah];W[ag]
