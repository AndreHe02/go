C[I'm "edgy";  I played White.   I'm not sure of my  strength, because I've played very few games  against  players whose rank I know.  My opponent in this  game (who was also unrated  on the server) said  afterwards that he's about 1k.

HI edgy!
I hope my comments will help you build your game (though I'm not a great go  player, i always enjoy listening to comments on my games)]
;B[dd];W[pc];B[dq];W[pp];B[co];W[pj]LB[pi:a][qi:b]C[I find this stone strange here : to imitate  the chinese fuseki,
white could play at a or b.
If white really wants to play the hoshi on the right side, maybe he should  play at q16 too (instead of q17)]
;B[nq]C[Maybe white could try a pincer here.  (variation)]
(;W[pn]C[of course this is surely correct too, though it enables  black to build the lower side. I wouldn't like to allow this, but surely it  is a matter of taste]
;B[jp];W[fc]C[Would it have been better for White to  play  around one of the star points instead?  Perhaps on  the upper side?

In my view, if white wants to play around one of the star points, he should  play on the left side.
In the same view, I think approaching black's stone from the left would be  better]
;B[hc]
(;W[fe]C[Should White have played at the 3-3 point instead?

If you don't like to be confined in the corner, you can play this way
(but the standard way to play will be shown later)];B[df]C[Now there are two  possibilities for white (variations)]

(;W[kc]C[Would this have been better a  point closer to  the Black stone?

(see variations) standard moves (locally) are J16 or H15
this move looks too close from uppper right corner];B[qe];W[pe]
C[peaceful  move, maybe inspired from a hoshi joseki ?
 i would play pincer at r13];B[pf];W[qd];B[oe];W[pd];B[of]C[this follows a  joseki when white stone is on the hoshi. white's corner is smaller (than with  a hoshi stone)]
;W[he]LB[kf:a][ke:b]C[This seemed like a good idea at the time, but Black   seems to get a good position from it.  Perhaps White  should have invaded the  left side?

This move could have been played earlier.
Now, i'd prefer a play around a or b];B[ie]C[standard];W[id]
C[i'd play on h16 and wait for black's answer
This move only invites black to cross-cut];B[hd]C[white has lots of defects  black will use]
;W[gd];B[hf];W[ge];B[jd]C[I suppose white had better leave  this stone and try for somrthing similar to the variation]

(;W[ic];B[jc];W[ib];B[jb];W[hb];B[je]C[white is overconcentrated (9 stones to capture 2 stones,  and build about 8 points of territory)]
;W[mc]LB[cj:A]C[Perhaps White should  have played at point A (C10) instead?  I thought I
needed to stabilize my group in the upper right, but I seem to have missed
my chance to invade the left side.

Ans : white group in the upper right risks about nothing (black stone on r15  is very vulnerable) and black will be reluctant to add a move on the upper  side (overconcentration)

Invading left or lower side appears to be necessary now];B[rf]
;W[qh]LB[pl:a][ql:b]C[And here I thought this move was needed to secure  the right  side, but after playing some forcing moves,  Black takes the left side star  point.

Right side is still open to invasion
eg black a (q8) will be a trouble for white, since nearly all stones looking  to the center are black's
black can surely play on b(r8) too, since s11 is sente for black]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[sc];W[sb];B[sd];W[qb];B[eb]C[This move is not a forcing move against white  !]
;W[fb]C[This isn't necessary. white should play elsewhere];B[dj]
C[Looks  like white can't be satidsfied with eroding black's moyo.  White also needs  lots of points to stay in the game]

(;W[cm]LB[gq:A][mp:B]C[Black has a big  moyo, and I knew White had to  invade.  I considered A or B (G3 or N4)   instead of  this move.  Would one of those have been better for  White?

now, any way white chooses to invade,black will build territory while White  will be forced to fly in the center  (B is surely worst than any other moves  you considered, see variation)]
;B[ck]C[black builds upper left and attacks  white at the same time]
;W[em];B[fp];W[gl];B[ld];W[lc];B[ig];W[mp]C[this is  the same move as white 'B' proposed earlier
with the same result];B[mq];W[np];B[lp];W[oq];B[lq];W[mm]C[white is behind on  the board  and will have to take care about his left group. the game looks  very difficult for white.]
;B[il]C[black will surely gain some territory with  this attack.
white has no choice but to "complicate" the game as much as possible (invade  lower side, then left side, then look for the best way to use his stones)
If white insists on defending his groups, he can't win];W[hj]
;B[gk];W[hk];B[hl];W[fl];B[fj];W[ek];B[ej];W[dl];B[en];W[fn]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[ho];W[gn];B[hn];W[gm];B[jj]LB[fk:a]C[White managed to live, but Black has marked out a  big  territory on the lower side and  on the left, so I guess Black is
winning.

black could try a little harder, playing at A (F9), making E8 a false eye if  white doesn't answer]
;W[lj];B[fg];W[kk]LB[nh:A]C[Maybe this is too  aggressive?  Would a move like A (O12)  be better for securing territory on  the right side?

ans: A is not good as long as right side is concerned (side is still open at  s11)]
;B[oj]C[I don't think White dealt very well with this; Black  managed to  reduce White's territory a lot.  What  should White have done?

in this position, even if white manages to keep all of the right side, black  is far ahead on the board.
In my view, white's position is very difficult to handle now]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[pi];B[nj];W[ok];B[nk];W[ol];B[ll];W[ml];B[mk]
;W[lm];B[kl];W[rg];B[km];W[ln];B[kn]C[Of course, giving the center to black is painful.
But if white wants to save his center stones, he'll have to give up a lot of  the right side.
Any way, black leads thge game];W[sf];B[re];W[qg];B[qf];W[nh]
;B[mh];W[ng];B[me];W[mf];B[lf];W[mi];B[lk];W[lh];B[ki];W[li]
;B[jh];W[kj];B[jk];W[lg];B[kf]C[It was about here that I realized that White was  losing badly.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[od];B[ec]C[white rescued the center stones, but is at least 20  points behind on the board.
Invasions on the left or lower side look dubious now.
