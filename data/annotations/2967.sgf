C[I played Black.

forfun (ff) - Hi Peter.  Thanks for an interesting game.  In this game the action started quickly on the right side but both players were a little slow to appreciate that the open corner what was the biggest point on the board.  Black woke up first and the game settled down for a bit.  As the middle game began, I had the feeling that Black was a little reluctant to attack White directly.  White left various weak stones around that could have provided Black with opportunities to better control the course of the game.  If there was one piece of advice I would give Black it would be to think harder about what are the opponent's weak stones and how they can be threatened effectively.  On a couple of key occassions Black was too defensive.  Twice on the left side Black defended unnecessarily.  This gave White two free moves and went a long way toward Black's eventual loss.  Even so the game was close until a misstep at the end.  Black did a good job overall keeping up with White.

I have not tried to comment every move but rather some of the more important ideas.  I have added a number of variations which are in many cases are just thought experiments.  Do not trust them to be always correct!  Feel free to test them and disagree.  Good luck in your future games.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[od]C[ff - This is a known but less common approach in professional play.  More usual is for White to occupy the upper left corner.  The focus from here is who will turn away to the upper left.]
;B[oe]LB[dc:B][oc:D][cd:C][dd:A]C[what about the Joseki I choose?

ff - Checking the database at gobase.org turned up 5 cases where Black played P15 in professional play.  All occurred in the 1970's.  It is not current among the pros.

The most frequent approach to handling P16 is to play in the upper left corner.  A, B, C and just about every other point have been played.

When Black answers directly in the upper right, D is much more frequently played.  Nevertheless we can't say anything directly against P15.  It is a reasonable idea.]
;W[ne];B[pe];W[md]
(;B[nf]C[ff - At this point Black should probably play in the upper left.  See the variation.]
;W[mf]
(;B[ng]C[ff - I think this is the wrong idea when the upper left is open (see the variation).  In this variation White inevitably has the option to decide when to stop pushing.  In many circumstances Black can accept being pushed along the sixth line as reasonable.  In this case, however, White's wall faces a mammoth open ground and White will have the chance to choose how best to exploit that wall.

Another way to look at it is that so far all the Black stones have been played on the right side of the board.  This is not a good idea at this early stage.]
;W[mg];B[nh];W[pj]LB[dd:A][ed:B]C[ff - White misses the strategic point here.  A play at A or B would be much better.

If White takes the upper left, there is not so much that Black can do on the right side.  In this situation, Black needs another play to enclose the lower right corner.  However, there is no ideal point on the side that will both enclose the corner and prevent an later invasion of the side by White.]

(;B[qn]C[Is it the right side?

ff - This is definitely the right direction but also definitely the wrong play :-)  It is too far away and too low.  Black is being greedy about the corner.  However, the corner is not large at this point in the game.  See the variation.]
;W[pg];B[nj]C[ff - Fundamentally the right idea, Black has no need to react directly to White's peep.]
;W[ql]C[ff - It is a pity that Black's stone at R6 was played so far away, isn't it?]
;B[dd]C[ff - Good thinking.  The gap between the stones at R6 and O10 is too large to trap White so turning away shows a calm judgement of the situation.]
;W[fd];B[cg]LB[df:A]C[ff - This is a little passive.  The usual answer to F16 is A.  Black chooses C13 instead when there is concern about a White play up from the left side.  That is not the case here.]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[cb];W[jp]LB[ff:A]C[ff - This is a big misstep.  White needs to finish up on the upper side at A.]
;B[hd]LB[cd:A]C[I think, this black move is a mistake, because of  the weakness at  A

ff - I think this is a very good move as long as Black realizes that the weakness at A is not important :-)]
;W[ff]
(;B[de]LB[kc:C][cd:B][hf:A]C[Is it better to answer at  A in spite of the weakness at B?

ff - A is much better!  I am a greedy player by nature so would also consider C already (though I think A is actually better).  See the variation.]
;W[ie]LB[hd:A]C[I think, now  A was aji keshi.

ff - Better to just call it a mistake :-)  In fact there is a lot of aji left in this stone, as Black showed later in the game.  It was a good choice to turn away for now and see how the game would go later.]
;B[lq];W[cj]C[ff - This is an overplay by White.  Black's corner is completely safe after D15 so White is just asking to be invaded.]
;B[gp]LB[hp:B][fq:A]C[Is it the right point to invade?

ff - The usual choice here is A.  The alternative when we see the K4/M3 relationship is to play at B.  G4 is an in-between play.  However, K4 is weak in any case so the basic idea is right.]
;W[eq]C[ff - Very submissive.];B[fo]LB[cn:A]C[ff - This play is perhaps too slow.  The immediate play at A looks attractive because once White answered at E3 Black can think of pushing White into a very small corner and attacking C10.  K4 will keep until later.]
;W[dn]C[ff - Once White plays here the position of F5 looks rather strange.  Imagine that White answered G4 with D6.  Would Black then be happy to exchange F5 for White E3?  I do not think so.]
;B[dk]LB[dl:A]C[Another white move at the right side (A) seems to good for white.

ff - In other words you agree that F5 was not so good :-)  However, this was a reasonable idea.  White can get into trouble by putting too much emphasis on the C10 stone.  See the variation.]

(;W[em]
(;B[ck]LB[gm:A]C[Should I defend at the lower side (perhaps at A)?

ff - The play at A is an interesting idea.  Black treats the D9 stone in a flexible way. In the game the bottom right third of the board was interesting.  The White group on the right is weak as is the White stone at K4.  Meanwhile the Black corner is also weak.  In the game, Black took some points on the left but let White move into the bottom.  In the end White gave up the K4 stone but erased Black's corner and strengthened the right side group.  This was not a favorable result for Black.  Black would probably have had a more interesting time after A.]
;W[gn]LB[ho:A][lp:B]C[ff - The question is what would Black have done if White had played A instead?  Black's shape is bad and White is pushing Black into White's strength.  Alternatively White might have started with B and then turned back to attack the two stones.]

(;B[io]LB[ho:A]C[ff - This looks natural, but is it?  Does Black have to hold back to A?  See the comments for the next play.]

(;W[gr]C[ff - This idea could have turned out better than it did for White but it is nevertheless somewhat passive.  See the variation.]
;B[ip]C[ff - This worked in a way that it should not have :-)  It does not actually fix the defects in Black's shape.]
;W[jq]LB[ir:A]C[I think, this was a white mistake. I cannot cut, if he play at A.

ff - If White A, Black can simply play K3.  That would have a good effect on the weak point at O3 but White would have sente.  It is one possible approach.  However, White's position in the game is stronger (or Black's is weaker) than it looks.]

(;B[fr]C[ff - This should not work (see White's next play).  So what should Black do instead?  See the variations.]

(;W[fq];B[hr];W[gq];B[hq];W[im];B[jn];W[ol];B[lo]TR[ck][dk]
C[I'm happy. I get the lower side and the marked stones.

ff - Basically this is a small play.  Black's corner is still vulnerable and the two White stones are very weak with very little opportunity to run out.]
;W[qp]
(;B[po];W[rn]
(;B[pp]C[ff - This is too passive.  Since Black added a stone at M5 the bottom becomes over-concentrated.  The White stones on the right side are stronger since White played P8 but Black still needs to think about getting compensation for the corner by attacking these stones.]
;W[ro]C[ff - White has wiped out most of the corner and made the right side stones quite safe.]
;B[gb];W[ic];B[id];W[jd];B[hc];W[jc]
(;B[ge]C[ff - Fundamentally F15 is a defect in White's position.  Black should think hard before forcing White to fix it.]
;W[fe];B[gf];W[fg];B[da]C[Should I fight on instead of connecting?

ff - Unfortunately, Black is pushing White from behind here and there is help waiting for White further down the board.  Connecting is a reasonable idea before trying to play from the opposite side.]
;W[dj];B[ej];W[ei]
(;B[di]C[Should I fight with double-hane instead of cutting?

ff - Definitely the idea is worth looking at.  Fundamentally White has more at risk in terms of weak stones than Black.  On the other had, if Black thinks that this cut is an attacking play instead of a defensive one...]
;W[ek]C[I think, I can't eke out, because I will lose the semiai.]

(;B[bj];W[ci];B[bi];W[dh];B[ch]C[ff - This move should be considered quite poor.  Black does not need it (White can not play B12).  It forces White to capture the stone at E10, something that White wants to do very much.]
;W[fj]C[But now, I think,White is ahead!];B[li]LB[oc:A]C[I try to elimate White's influence, but  A is also a very big point. Should I play there?

ff - Black's stone at G14 is connected out so there is not so much potential here for White.  I think that A would be better.]
;W[hs];B[is];W[gs];B[ir];W[pc]C[It's a pity for Black.];B[qc]
;W[qb];B[bn]C[But now, I think, this point is the bigger one.]
;W[bo];B[bm];W[co];B[rb];W[pb];B[qh]LB[rr:A]C[It's a big move, but what's about A?]
;W[qi];B[ph];W[rh];B[rg];W[ri];B[qg];W[qq];B[ij]LB[pr:A]C[I try to crush White's territory in the center, but A is also a big move!

ff - Again, White does not have too much territory in the center.  Black seems to overestimate the potential here twice (M11 and then J10.  As a result, White pulls ahead a bit.]
