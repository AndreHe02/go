;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qj];W[dj];B[jc];W[jq]C[Sound, but very conservative for Black so far. White has failed to take the initiative, which is usually essential in order to overcome Black's first move advantage.]
;B[fd];W[df];B[ec];W[dc];B[jj]C[Good. Black is outlining a moyo at the upper right, and White cannot mirror it. Black can afford to let White take sente at this point, since White is well behind.]
;W[nq];B[pn]LB[oq:a][np:b]C[Too conservative. Black can and should make contact at point a, White will probably respond at b, and then Black can play at the marked stone, with a profit in the corner.]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[op];B[po];W[gp]C[White should invade rather than play so passively.]
;B[dm]C[The right place to invade.];W[cn];B[cm];W[dn];B[fl]
;W[gn]LB[gj:a][dh:b]C[White is protecting a formation that is already strong. Point a is better, threatening Black's invasion and protecting against a second invasion at b. Now that White has such a strong wall, Black can invade at C3, as in variation 2, stealing territory, making life, but not helping White build outside influence.]

(;B[dh];W[ch];B[ej];W[ci];B[di];W[cj];B[fh];W[qf];B[qd]LB[qe:a]
C[Point a is again better.];W[qh]C[White's base is too narrow, and there is no place to escape to. Black should squeeze White hard.]
;B[pi];W[of];B[nd]LB[ne:a]C[Squeeze harder at point a.];W[oh]
;B[oi];W[nh];B[ni];W[mf];B[ld]LB[mh:a]C[This lets White make eye space.  Wall White in at point a instead.]
;W[mi]C[*aizuz*: few years];B[mj];W[li];B[kg]LB[lg:a][lj:b]
C[White can make room for an eye by playing at a, or can escape by playing at b. Black should have walled White off from the lower side at b.]
;W[lg];B[lf];W[kf];B[le];W[kh];B[jg];W[ng];B[jh];W[lj]C[White finally escapes.]
;B[ki]LB[mk:a]C[This is on the strong side, which doesn't need shoring up. Strengthen the weak side at a.]
;W[lh]LB[mk:a]C[White should let this single stone go, and push further out at a, a move that may be worth ten points or more.]
;B[mk]C[Good. Although White can still escape, Black can build walls around the escape route, solidifying a lot of territory.]
;W[kk]LB[kj:a][ll:b][jl:c]C[In the game, Black continues at a. This move accomplishes nothing. Black should build walls, confining White and solidifying territory. Points b and c are both strong.]
;B[kj];W[lk];B[ll];W[jl];B[lo]LB[il:a]C[This gives White too much room. Point a seals off the Black moyo above, presses on White, and threatens to invade White below.]
;W[lp];B[no]LB[jm:a]C[Although this wall marks off a good territory, it also allows White to expand.  Point a expands Black's territory while pressing on White and threatening further invasion.]
;W[mp]LB[ff:a][hk:b]C[This side does not need such solidity facing a loose Black wall. White missed a chance to invade at a or b.]
;B[mo];W[ko];B[kn];W[jo];B[ee]C[A weak move. It is too soon to finish a wall here, when the center is still open. Black should be pushing on White's formations at the bottom and in the center.]
;W[de]C[ White should ignore Black's move, which is no threat, and invade in the center.]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[ef];W[hk];B[hj]C[The middle game is almost over, with boundaries sketched in everywhere. Black is ahead, with about 100 points marked out, against White's 90.]
;W[gk];B[gj]LB[fk:a][cq:b]C[For reviewer: I think this move(83) should have  been played at F9.  Would this have turned the  game around?

Reviewer: No, F9 (point a) would have allowed White to invade, whereas the move you made secures your territory. The killer move is C3, point b. It is worth more than 20 points.]
;W[fk];B[ek];W[fj];B[fi];W[el];B[dl];W[em]C[White cedes sente. Black should invade at C3.]
;B[gm]MA[dm][dl][cm]LB[dk:a]C[This move loses the three marked stones, and gives White more than 10 points of extra territory, but cannot save the dead Black stone in this enclosure. Black would have won the game easily by connecting at a.]
;W[dk];B[ei];W[bm];B[il]LB[ik:a][hl:b]C[This threat makes White solidify, with no benefit to Black. A Black move at point a forces White to reply at b, and then Black gets to invade successfully by taking this point. White has to escape at c, and so cannot block the invasion.]
;W[ik]C[Vital.];B[ij]C[Vital.];W[jk]C[Vital.];B[jm]C[Now that the White formation is solid, the Black stones inside it pose no threat to White and have no value to Black. It is time to invade at C3.]
;W[im];B[in];W[jn];B[km];W[hl];B[hm]LB[cq:a]C[There is no ko here, and no invasion either. The vulnerable spot is point a.]
;W[il];B[fn];W[en];B[go];W[fo];B[hn];W[fm];B[pr]C[This move is gote. That means that Black moves first and last, giving up the initiative (sente) to White. Black should play sente endgame moves (Black moves first, White moves last) before gote moves.]
;W[oq];B[or];W[nr];B[qr];W[re]C[Sente for White.];B[rd];W[sd]
;B[sc];W[se];B[rc];W[qe]C[This move is unnecessary.];B[ph]C[This move without Black's next move is sente.]
;W[pg];B[rh]C[Gote.];W[rg];B[qi];W[qg];B[sh];W[sg];B[ri];W[eb]
C[Gote for White.];B[fb];W[ed];B[fc];W[db]C[White has made the last required move.]
;B[ea]C[Black now moves in gote.];W[da];B[fa];W[oo]C[Sente.]
;B[on];W[kl]C[Sente.];B[lm]LB[mm:a]C[Playing at point a protects both cutting points,  makes invasion impossible.]
;W[ml];B[nl]LB[mm:a];W[mm];B[ln];W[nm];B[nn];W[nk];B[nj];W[ol]
;B[pl];W[os]C[Gote.];B[ps];W[ns];B[me];W[oe];B[od]C[Black could still have invaded at C3, with a profit of about 25 points.]
;W[cq]C[Invasion at this point was still possible. This move requires no reply, so it is gote.]
;B[ne]C[Sente.];W[nf];B[np]C[Sente.];W[mq];B[pe]C[The last gote.]
