C[Hi,

This is Wonodan from KGS.

I rarely play with that account, but feel free to send any questions back at lauri.vihavainen@gmail.com

Let's have fun!

I will try to mark most of my comments beginning with W:

---

In this game, I played Black.

I think that my opening resulted in a handful of attackable groups.  Although nothing large died, I think this phenomenon caused problems for me throughout the game.

I think I need help on timing issues.  Specifically, I would like to know when I should have played in White's developing lower right corner.

I feel there were many spots in the game where if I had played a slightly better move, I might have been able to win.

Thanks for any help you can give me.];B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[pp]
;B[do]C[W: I love this opening for black.];W[fp];B[cq];W[cr]
;B[cp]LB[eq:A][br:A][er:B]C[W: the point A is usually vital for both sides]
(;W[eq]LB[ck:C][cl:A][br:B]C[Apparently this move is not joseki, but I don't see any obvious weaknesses to exploit.]
(;B[cl];W[iq]LB[jd:A][qn:B]
(;B[jd]C[W: This is a large move, but it does let white take a big point on the right at Q10, greatly strenghtening his opening. See suggestion.]
;W[qf];B[qh]TR[jd]C[I thought a pincer was a good idea at the time because of the marked stone, but White eventually is able to launch attacks on the upper corner and the center stones.  I think this causes headaches for Black.  What alternative moves are there?

W: Any pincer you play here is correct. No one can blame Black r12 as it is a superb move.]
;W[of];B[nd]LB[pi:B][qj:A]
(;W[qj]LB[oh:A][rh:A][qi:B]C[W: White is very aggressive. Black's opening is developing quickly, so white wants to create an upset. At the moment, he has a connection underneath at A.]
(;B[oh]C[W: Good move.];W[mf]LB[ld:B][oj:A]
(;B[oj]LB[lc:A][ld:B]
(;W[lc]C[W: Bad move.];B[ld]C[W Perfect answer.];W[kd]LB[kc:A]
[ke:B]
(;B[kc]C[W: This is a greedy overplay.

You have played 4 stones here, it does not mean that the top side is YOURS. 

It means that FIGHTING at the top is easier for you, than white.

What does FIGHTING mean in go?

Cutting, and surrounding.

Instead of trying to get everything, just CUT M17 and L16 from N14, and SURROUND them.

Let him live SMALL, and build huge FORTRESSES.

That is far more devastating for white.];W[md];B[ke];W[me]LB[qe:B]
[re:A]
(;B[re]C[Now that Black is sealed in, he needs to live in the corner.  This move aims at making space, but...]
;W[rg]LB[mc:B][nc:A]C[...with this move White not only keeps up the pressure but can link up to the outside.  Should Black play at S12 immediately?]

(;B[pb]C[W: I have a strong feeling this is unnecessary.];W[rh]
;B[qi];W[ri];B[li]C[All the groups seem stable for now, but White will be able to launch attacks on three separate groups later on.

W: The groups are safe. It is very hard for white to attack any of them.]
;W[cf]LB[qf:A][qh:B][ci:A]TR[ch]C[W: As before with A and B, Black expects to pincer hoping for white to jump in the corner. Of course that might not happen, but it's the default joseki to be expected in this situation.]
