C[Dear Reviewer,

I had B in this game and tried some new opening ideas.  I think B had a comfortable lead into the middle game.  But still W kept close through the middle game.  I know for sure why I lost (you'll see -- a last-minute, last-second loss), but please advise as to how I could've played the middle game more solidly and more profitably.  As for the opening, please point out unreasonable moves by B and how W could've disrupted B's rhythm in the opening.

Thanks very much for your help!

Best,
Ken];B[pc];W[dp];B[cn]C[Just trying something new.  And thought that B could perhaps decide which corner to play next depending on W's response.

** Fine.];W[cl]C[** Not normal.];B[en]LB[cq:A][cp:B]CR[cl]C[** (a) is better, white must block at (b) after which the marked stone
is no longer ideally placed.];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq]C[** This is a bad exchange for black, since he doesn't get a base
here (because of the white pincer stone). Better to leave the
option of invading at C3 for later.];B[oq]C[** Left corner does not seem to be finished, black should
pincer the white stone above.];W[el]C[** Does not look good, probably white should just extend along
the left.];B[gn];W[hp]C[** White loses sente.];B[dd]C[Felt good to have played in three corners first.  The B7-11 group should be okay, since W4-10 looks somewhat vulnerable, too?

** Yes, you're right. Black looks better here. Still, white can gain something
from attacking black's group, it's weaker than white's.];W[cf]
LB[ch:A][cg:B][dg:C][df:D]C[** None of the alternatives seem perfect. (a) looks very slow,
while the other leave some sort of invasions. So it looks fine
to go all out here, even though it will lead to a fight.];B[di]
LB[df:A][ef:B]C[Is this a good move or just asking for trouble?

** It's a good move *and* asking for trouble ... :) Sometimes
a fight can't be avoided. It might be good enough for black to
limit the size of white's territory with (a), or (b), but the
splitting play certainly looks tempting.];W[ef];B[fd];W[fi]
C[** That combination was to be expected.];B[dg];W[df];B[fh]
C[Expected W18, and was ready with this combination.];W[fg]
LB[gf:A][ge:B]C[** This doesn't look good, white should try not to touch what he
is attacking. (a) or (b) would divide the pressure more evenly between
the group above and the group below.];B[gh]LB[eh:A]C[** Looks safer than (a).]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[eg];B[fj]C[** Black is satisfied.];W[gl];B[hj]
LB[gi:A]C[** Just take at (a). White now has several possible forcing
moves.];W[il]C[Sigh of relief.  Had W played H7 instead instead, could've been very bad for B?

** Yes, black would be enclosed and probably forced into a small
life.];B[bq]C[Still, some space on the side first.

** Again these moves are not necessary, just jump out
and leave some aji along the bottom.];W[br];B[cp];W[cr];B[do]
;W[ep]C[W a bit too submissive here?

** C2 could have been at D3, but that loses some points in the
corner. So looks ok by white.];B[in];W[jp];B[kn];W[mq];B[kl]
CR[jp][mq]C[Another happy move.

** Yes, the marked white stones take some territory, but
adds stones to the already-strong bottom. White should  have played from above.]
;W[bi];B[bl]LB[dk:A][bj:B]C[** This seems to lose better opportunities for black - (a)+(b)
perhaps? For the time being black should just take a big point
somewhere else (since the white group can escape anyway).];W[bk]
;B[bm];W[ck];B[pi]C[Looks like B has done well in the opening?

** Yes, he looks ahead.];W[hc];B[eb]LB[kd:A][he:B][cc:C]C[To minimize trouble.  But is there anyway to put pressure on W48?

** An alternative would be (a), (b), (c). (a) for (b) must be a good
exchange for black, no?];W[lc]LB[jc:A]C[** No reason to leave an invasion at (a).]
;B[bd]C[Have often lost due to last-minue corner death, so wanted to play solid here.

** Fair enough :)];W[nc]LB[jc:A][qe:B][qp:C]C[** White is trying to patch up the weakness at (a), but exchanging
O17 for (b) is the wrong way to do it. There are also very big moves
in the lower right corner.];B[qe]C[Q15 better?

** This looks fine.];W[he];B[id];W[hd]C[Can't W actually answer at J17?  Really no harm can be done if B pushes through at H16?

** Both look possible. J17 is safety-first, and gives black some more
thickness on the outside. H16 is more confident of the white position.]
;B[ic];W[ie];B[kd]LB[le:A]C[** (a) next looks interesting, seems to give a semeai between
the black and white groups.];W[kc];B[kf]C[An indirect way to enlarge the right-side moyo.

** Yes, but white nevertheless gains by getting the two stones.]
;W[jd];B[je];W[jc];B[qp];W[mo];B[lp]LB[kp:A]C[** (a) looks better.]
;W[mp];B[lo]C[Maybe could've played B69 at M3?  or L4?

** L4 lets white connect, M4 suggests accepting a big loss
in the lower right corner (after white M5). If you can't cut
through after something like M4, it's of course better to play
from the outside.];W[lq];B[pm];W[pg]C[** Doesn't seem to be the best point to enter.]
;B[oe]LB[qg:A]C[Is there a better way to attack?

** Isn't black ahead after (a) ? No need to win by 100 pts...]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[pj]C[** White succeeds in complicating things.]
;B[oi]LB[qk:A]C[Is this the correct direction?  Is it right for B to still worry about the B3-41 group's safety?

** Looks good. (a) would let white squeeze with P11 and so on.
About the group in the lower left, it's always good to keep an eye
on groups that are not completely alive yet. But it should not really
be a concern in this position.];W[qk]C[** Looks like white has nothing really good here.]
;B[rj];W[rk];B[ri];W[pl];B[qh]C[** A loss for white, but he gets some compensation below.]
;W[qm];B[ol]LB[pn:A]C[** This move shows that you have a very good feel for the game.
(a) is probably the "normal" move.];W[pn];B[om];W[or]LB[qn:A]
[po:B][qo:C]C[** Black can cut at (a) or enclose at (b), so white should
just play (c) here.];B[pr];W[nr];B[qq];W[ro]C[** Now white gets an efficient result.]
;B[rp];W[oo];B[qo];W[qn];B[rn]C[** More urgent moves than taking this stone, black is alive
already.];W[rm];B[so]C[How's this result for B?  Felt it was okay, with a large gain around W72 and a solidified LR corner.  And there's more to expect in the center, too.  Correct assessment?

** Black started with the superior position on the right side, so on
the whole I think white gained slightly here.];W[be];B[cd]LB[cc:A]
C[** (a) is 2 points better.];W[pb];B[qb]LB[oc:A]C[Should simply R17?

** How about (a) first, then R18?];W[pd]C[** Not only the corner is important, also the centre ...]

After this move, please point out any grossly inappropriate yose moves.

** My feeling is that white is slightly ahead here with the komi,
but not more than 2-3 points.];B[on];W[po];B[mn]C[** Good.]

;B[ih];W[ml];B[mm];W[ko];B[ln]C[B leads by a little now?

** It's very close, something like 1/2 or 1 1/2 either way.]
;W[nn]LB[nq:A]C[** This is small, at most 1/2 point. Note that black is not keen
to exchange O6 for (a).];B[nm];W[no];B[dl]C[** 1 1/2 points.]
;W[dk]C[** 1 point.];B[sm]C[** 1 point in reverse sente.];W[sl]
;B[sn];W[al]LB[cm:A]C[** Better to play (a).];B[am];W[ak];B[cm]
;W[ee];B[fa];W[ha];B[sj];W[sk];B[os]LB[nq:A]C[** Without a stone at (a), this is just 1 point in gote.]

LB[jn:A]CR[ok]C[Definitely B win now, with W having to play one more at J18....Fatal complacency.  It causes last-minute blindness :p

any territory. END OF COMMENTS.];W[kg]C[...........];B[lh];W[jg]
