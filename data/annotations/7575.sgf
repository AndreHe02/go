C[JEB: This was a game played by me (I think I'm about 16-18K) against a stronger player on KGS to get ranked.  I did OK, but there were many times where I don't think I played terribly well, and that was exploited quite well by my opponent.  I squeaked by in the end by a lucky invasion of their center group.  It was their mistake, rather than my brilliant plan.

Any comments on places where I went wrong, under-or overplayed, or anything else would be much appreciated.

FA: Hi there, 
i'm faza, 10k KGS
i'll try to review your games
Just like this, i'll mark my comment with FA];B[dp];W[pp];B[qe]

(;B[qg];W[oe]C[JEB: Should I have defended against this cut earlier?  If so, when?

FA: this is not normal joseki for mokuhazushi but i think you did ok
i myself preferred to sacrifice P16 and try to get larger moyo on the right or the upper side
about defending the cut, check the earlier variation]
(;B[nd];W[of]
(;B[oh]C[JEB: I thought I could contain them.  Would p13 have been a better move for that, and afforded white less opportunity?

FA: Better to let it be and made an extension, maybe at R9
capturing this stone is quite hard since u got to worry about the snapback at R14]
;W[pg];B[qf];W[ph];B[qh];W[pi];B[qi];W[pj]C[JEB: I thought it was safe to start working on the other corner here.  I was wrong, and should have continued extending.]
;B[dd];W[qj];B[rj];W[rk];B[sj];W[sk]C[JEB: T12 was the better move here, I think.

FA: Still dead, bith T12 and S12]
(;B[ri];W[sh]
(;B[nq]C[JEB: I gave up on the group at that point and moved elsewhere.  But perhaps it could have been saved even at that point?

FA: N4 is better kakari cause it's also prepare a ladder breaker
this variation will work except if your opponent respond N4 with Q7
However, W central group will be a bit problematic if ladder occur]

;W[mp];B[on];W[po];B[qk];W[ql];B[pk]C[JEB: I got lucky here, as they misread the ladder.  It enabled me to make life for the group on the edge later.

FA: yup, but this put your lower group in trouble if your opponent give better respond
i think he hope you to respond the atari at O6 to capture the ladder, it's obvious that O5 and the upper right group is incomparable...]

(;B[id];W[mq]C[JEB: I was surprised by this, as I thought my move above was big enough that it demanded response.  But this seemed to characterize their playing style quite a bit - really digging into me hard and forcing me to defend.  I wonder if there was a way I could have more elegantly responded, or should I have given up on a few of these groups to make bigger territory gains elsewhere?

FA: keep this in mind: don't let your opponent has a sente
if he has it he always able to invade later]

(;B[ke]C[JEB: My attempt to not let them have the entire center of the board.  Perhaps l13 would have been better?  I just felt safer with this, given how I had been pushed around the board.  But, as you'll see, I got fairly pushed again.

FA: see the variation before
the reason u being pushed again is because you let him to do so

if W play somewhere else this H12 will be a sure kill, else you hava a better chance to life in center]
;W[ih];B[em]C[JEB: I took this move on a whim.  Then I saw the possibility of what is about to happen.  I think by not defending at h6 early in the game, they left themselves open to what happened next.

FA: wrong side
if W respond correctly B invasion will be in vain];W[fn];B[fm]
(;W[gm];B[ho]C[JEB: At this point, I was going to break into the center one way or another.  I'm surprised they didn't connect at k5, as I think I would have been more easily contained if I only captured the group at f5.

FA: either way W in a bad position
so i think W decision can be considered good];W[ic];B[ib];W[jc]
;B[jb];W[kd];B[me];W[kb]C[JEB: I should have seen what they were going for here and moved at k16, I think.  Then followed with the l19 move.

generally u play quite well
this is a few tips for u
-think if some of your group need to be strenghthen or not
if not, u can play somewhere else
if yes, better to strenghthen it first
-put attention on miai
if there's a miai you can attacking instead of defending
(like your 149th move)
-try to approximate both you and your opponent moyo
if your opponent has a big moyo, it's better to reduce it as fast as you had a chance
it's alright if there's more moyo for you to claim though
-work on life and death problem 
goproblem is a nice site to train
you can also download Cho Chikun elementary encyclopedia about life and death here:
http://www.4shared.com/dir/3271995/c4d85e29/Gosharing.html
