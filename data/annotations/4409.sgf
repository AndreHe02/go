C[Dear reviewer,

Although i did win this game, it was a difficult one. In the middle of the game i was about 50 points behind and even after i killed one of my opponents groups, he was still 10 to 20 points ahead. So i think i can learn a lot from a review of this game. Thank you very much in advance.]

LB[jp:A][kq:C][lq:E][qq:D][pr:B]C[
janr: usually, white either plays A without first playing B, or white plays C instead of A
The problem is that white has still a weak point at E.  and black already occupied D, so if black invades the side at E, white can not flexibly take the corner any more.  When white plays C, there is no easy invasion point left for black.]
;B[cn]C[I'm not sure about this move. I was afraid wC8, bC3 and white would get a wall which works nicely with his K4 stone. Is the corner enough compensation for the wall white gets or should black play C10 or K16?]
;W[cp]LB[fq:A]C[janr: I is unusual to defend the corner so early in the game. Black has still invasion possibilities around A later.]
;B[ck];W[gq];B[cf];W[ce]C[janr: it is unusual for white to play the kosumi tsuke here, as it strengthens black.]
;B[df];W[fd];B[hc]C[Is this too agressive?
Should i defend against an invasion between C9 and C14?

janr: I think black is OK.  the game move is a good point to annoy white, as there are several problems in whites corner now.]
;W[jc];B[he];W[nc]
(;B[ff]C[I was afraid of white playing here so i thought i should play here. What do you think?

janr: fencing in white is very good.  Of course it costs black one move, so his corner gets weaker.  It may be better for black to first answer white and threaten to split the white stones creating a complicated fight for him (see variation)]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[hf];B[ie];W[hg]
(;B[ke]LB[ic:B][gd:C][kd:A][ld:F][jf:E][jg:D]C[I thought a long time about this move. I also considered A, B and C but with A i was afraid white would cut through. I thougth B would make a strong connection and prevent white from playing there, but i didn't play it because i thought it would strengthen white too much. I didn't play C because i thought it would weaken the F14 stones too much. Finally i'd like to know what you think of black D to put  some pressure on the two white stones.

janr: I would avoid B and C as they seem to strengthen white without reason.  If white does something threatening, black can still play these moves (as they are sente).  I would also avoid playing D as a keima is easy to cut.  A looks possible.  If white simply plays on the third line, black can strengthen himself preparing to attack whites center stones.  I think a white cut is unreasonable as white can not capture black (see variation).  Another possibility for black is to play E, which keeps distance from all weak white groups.  With the game move, a white move around F may strengthen white in sente, which would lead to an inferior result compared with A.]
;W[ld];B[jg]LB[ld:C][ke:B][le:D][jf:A][kg:E]C[janr: the shape looks suboptimal for black.  It would be more efficient to play A directly, Black would run a little slower, but would avoid the white-strengthening exchange B-C.  
I would have expected that Black, instead of the game move, would play D (which further strengthens black and prepares a wider jump) or E (which is a little faster then the game move)]
;W[ci]LB[hg:B][jg:C][gh:E][ci:A][dj:F][ej:G][ck:D]C[I don't know how to respond to this. Maybe i should have defended here with my previous move? The move i played doesn't seem to work so well. Where would you play?

janr: If black splits A and B, white has clearly more weak groups than black.    It seems easier for black to capture A than B, and territory along the side is more interestign than in the center.  Moreover, capturing A would avoid D to get weak, while C seems already quite strong, so there is no hurry to capture B.  In conclusion, I would start a leaning attack around E, in the hope of playing the ideal attack/capture at F or G later.]
;B[ei]LB[ei:B][dj:A][ck:C]C[janr: the point of A is a good one for white.  Locally speaking, playing A is better for black than playing B, as A drives the white stone towards his wall, while forcing white to come out at A may later damage C]
;W[dj];B[dk];W[ej];B[fi];W[ek];B[en]LB[el:A]C[janr: As black is also weak, playing A may be better shape.]
;W[dm]
(;B[cm]LB[dn:A]C[janr: how about playing A (see variation) ?]
;W[dn];B[bo];W[bp];B[dl];W[el];B[em];W[do];B[bl]C[janr: The result is successful for white, as black was forced to live locally, and white can now capture the two black stones in the center, at the same time connecting his groups and making a moyo.]
;W[bj];B[bk];W[fm]LB[ei:A][cm:B][en:C]C[This seems to be a huge succes for white. Could you please tell me which moves in the sequence where wrong and where i should have played instead.

janr: I think A, B and C all contributed to this result.  B is very submissive.  C should not be played in order to abandon it in the next few moves.  A is not the optimal direction.]

(;B[hi]C[janr: A is the cleaner capturing move.];W[ih]C[janr: It looks too early for white to create another weak group between relatively strong black ones.]

(;B[ij]C[janr: Before starting to run and fight, maybe it 
is a good idea to play a probe in the corner.  I expect that white's response should at least allow one of both black groups room for safety.]
;W[jh]LB[md:B][le:A][jg:D][kg:C]C[janr: remember that it would have been better to play A-B and jump to C instead of D.  That would make a good difference now attacking white]
;B[lg];W[kh]LB[ki:A]C[janr: White A or some other faster move would be better.]

;W[gl];B[hl];W[hm];B[il];W[im];B[rh];W[ri];B[oc]LB[gb:A]C[I regret playing this move. I think Q18 is better because it doesn't strengthen white.

janr: black is very strong but the corner is still open.  It is not trivial to kill all the white stones.
Still, It may be possible to attack both these white stones and the upper left white corner. (e.g. around A).]

I think white can kill the black stone.]
