C[Dear reviewer, thanks for your time!
In this game i played the low chinese, one of my favorite aperture, but i feel i handled very bad the invasion white made.
I would like to improve in handling invasion, so any advice is wellcome.
Also if you want point out any other mistake it's wellcome.

Hi!

You lost this game by 15 points. Which is less than the size of the group you lost in the lower right corner. If you hadn't lost that group you would have won the game.

Dealing with invasions always mean playing globally. In most cases, this means building thickness that will be used to gain profit on other parts of the board.]

This move is slack.

Normally, the shoulder hit is used to chase a group towards your thickness. But here,  you don't have thickness.

Where are you going to chase White?];W[mp]

Now that White has a base, he is ready to launch a severe attack against you.]

Look at P4. It doesn't help you in dealing with this invasion.

A stone at Q5 would be extremely helpful at this point. Once your stones become disconnected, it will be a very hard game for you.]

Your group in the corner is in mortal danger! You will die before he does. You have no choice but to let him kill the cutting stone in exchange for life.]

This move doesn't put enough pressure on White.

White is almost dead. You need to prevent him from connecting or making 2 eyes. 

The move you played prevents him from connecting, but it lets him make 2 eyes.]

;W[mi]C[----

This move is no longer available to you. White is alive now.

You always have to look for opportunities like this. If you let them go, they can cost you the game.

I will end the review here, your end game is pretty good.];B[ac]

N11 is a severe move. White must defend against the follow up at A.]

(;W[ll]C[----

If White tries to run away...];B[li]LB[mg:A]C[----

This is a hard  move for white to deal with given the structural weakness of his group.]
)
(;W[li];B[jj];W[ll];B[jl]C[----

White will have to play extremely delicately to get out of this.

Try a few variations to see if you can make white live.])))
(;B[rn]C[----

I don't think it's possible for Black to connect.

Try to find ways for Black to connect and see how White can always prevent your connection. You will learn much from exploring variations.]
;W[rm];B[qn];W[qm];B[rp];W[rk];B[mk]C[----

Not much Black can do. But at least, the corner is not dead.]

(;AB[po]AE[op]C[----

If you had played Q5, it would be much eaiser to deal with the invasion.

It would be easy, in this case, to build thickness and attack the White group on the bottom.]
;B[rm];W[qn];B[pn];W[qm];B[om]C[----

You are either connected or alive in the corner.]))
(;B[jq]C[----

Don't let White make a base.

This gets complicated really fast. The goal is to solidify the right corner while attacking white.]
))
(;B[po]LB[qm:A]TR[nq]C[----

Q5 is normal.

White cannot attack at A yet, because he needs to take care of his stone.

If White plays A right now, he will have 3 weak groups to take care of.]
))
(;B[md]TR[oi][qi]C[----

I don't know how white will respond, but ideally you should be building thickness that will help you attack the invading stones.]

TR[oi][qi]C[----

This might not be how white would play, but this is what you are aiming for (you will fight if white resists this outcome).

Once you have your thickness (it might be a different pattern), then you can attack White in order to gain profit.]
;B[mk];W[mi];B[kk];W[ki];B[ik];W[ii];B[jp]TR[kd][ld][md][qi]
C[----

In this hypothetical situation, Black's thickness on the top side was used to deal with the invasion at R11 and the result was profit on the bottom side.

This is what I mean by playing globally to deal with invasions. When you deal properly with an invasion, you gain somewhere else on the board.

It is rarely as easy as this example, but with practice you'll get the feel of it.]
