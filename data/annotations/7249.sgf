C[Dear Reviewer,
Thank you for the review.
I played White in this game and lost by 17.5 points.
It seems to me that my problem in this game is looking at the overall board, so although I won local fights my opponent acquired a lot of influence and won by large mragin. So any help you me give me is welcome.
Thanks, Avi];B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[jd];W[pj]C[Is this a good move? I tried to split the center because if Black plays here now he will have a lot of influence, and any approach or invasion will be a target for a strong attack



Maybe white approaching the upper right corner would be bigger, to keep black from getting to large up there.]
;B[ph];W[qn];B[ql];W[on];B[qo];W[rn];B[np];W[pk]C[I tried to stabilize my group here]
;B[qi]C[white stablizes but black corner grows with sente !]
;W[rj];B[pe];W[dj]C[Is this good, or should I have played around G17?

Maybe g17 better since each grows white, but g17 also shrinks black.]
;B[fc]C[similarly, this shrinks white and grows black.

Look for moves that both grow your own and shrink the opponent simultaneously.]
;W[id]C[I am not sure about this move, but I had to prevent black from playing for example F15


Might be ok, but f16 or f15 come to mind also.

Also, m3 on bottom looks big.];B[jc];W[gd];B[cc]C[maybe black letting white off easily ?  What if black f16 instead of c17 ?]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[ec]C[
instead of this black move, how about black b16 and connect.  I think that also protects against the cut here.]
;W[fd]C[It looks OK for White so far, is not it?

This seems good for white, but I don't hink black needed to give white this good position.]
;B[fp];W[dn];B[jq];W[hp]C[
I think white usually invades deeper at h3 instead of h4.];B[hq]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[gq];B[ir];W[hr];B[iq];W[gp];B[fr];W[fq]C[Should I have played G2?]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[og]C[Here started the sequence that to my opinion led to my loss. I managed to invade the left side, but it was too costly: Black took control of the center and the bottom left side. So please give me your advise here.

FIrst thing I'd wonder is, whether white g2 is sente against the corner .  For example, if black does nothing and white follows with b4 what happens ?  Even if not completely sente, the g2 may be big enough to be worth playing.  

Of course, it also makes L4 followed by M4 or N4 sente.

P13 is played in an area that has many black stones, so it seems it can be chased profitably.

Instead, what about K16 to expand white's area ?];B[oh];W[qg]

(;B[pq]C[instead of this q3, what if black had played s17 as in variation]
;W[ro];B[qp];W[qc];B[ml]C[i think black attacking too closely here

maybe white can make left side so big that white can give up some stones here, for example with g10 ?

or maybe white starts with k14 to reduce black and grow white ?]

;B[km];W[ln];B[ki];W[kh]C[
For white, instead of pushing here, how about strenghthening the 2 stones with H13 to keep up attack on black ?]
;B[li];W[lh]C[I realize now this is an overplay by White. Connecting at K12 would have been much better.

Yes I think so.];B[jh];W[ji];B[jg];W[hg];B[mi];W[dh];B[cn];W[en]
