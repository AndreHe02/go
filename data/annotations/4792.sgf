C[Dear Reviewer,
I have played Black in this game, and won by just 0.5 point (the komi was only 0.5 point also), so this was a very close game and that's why I have selected it for review.
I appreciate your comments on all stages including the yose.
Please treat all my comments as questions - if you think they are incorrect I will be happy to know!
Thanks!];B[pd];W[cp];B[dd];W[pq];B[ep];W[cm]C[This is the first time I have seen this White play, so I am not my response was correct.]

(;B[en]C[Ihave chosen this play.  Later I saw in gobase.org several other options but not the one I selected. Looking at it now, I am not too happy - although it was not too bad.

Basti: If you have enough room to make a base you should make it. Going into the middle is unlogical then.]
;W[do]C[Basti: An Aji-Keshi because later white could peep from the other side.]
;B[eo];W[jq];B[hq];W[mp];B[cq];W[bq];B[dq]C[At the end of this sequence Black is more or less stable, but White has established a good base on the Bottom Right and he has sente, so I would not call it a good result for Black.]
;W[br]C[I think this is rather slack on White's side - he probably was concerned about Black B5, but at the moment this would not work accoring to my reading and I would extend to C10 if I were White.

Basti: I think the white move is alright. it strengthens the white group and weakens the black group at the same time.]
;B[ck]C[I was happy to take this point.

Basti: I think this goes against the proverb: "Play away from thickness." 
The top or right side is more important. This move is not sente.]
;W[dl];B[dk]C[Basti: Black is happy to play here.];W[el];B[fj]
C[This looks certainly good for Black.

Basti: I Agree.];W[ek]C[This looks to me bad for White also - forcing Black to strengthen himself...]
;B[ej];W[jc];B[hc];W[cc]C[Basti: Another mistake. Why did white play at K17 first?
K17 gets very weak now.];B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb]
;B[gb];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[cf];W[nc];B[lc]C[I think this was the correct response now that White has made the 3-space extension. Probably White should have extended only to N17 (s-space).

Basti: The group would still be weak because of C17.];W[lb]

(;B[kc]C[Basti: A strange move.];W[kb];B[jd];W[ic];B[id];W[mc]
;B[le]C[I am not sure if at this point or slightly later Black should have taken a bigger point around J10.

Basti: Yes or play on the right side. It's still empty!];W[ne]
;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ih]C[White has manage to take sente and invade. Chosing between attacking from the outside and taking the cash was difficult now...]
;B[gh]C[...and I finally selected to take territory. I was aware that the game is quite close now, but I evaluated it still as small lead for Black.]
;W[ij];B[hl];W[ki];B[hn]C[I was satisfied to extend my territory on this side also.

Basti: Too small I think. R10 looks important.];W[hg];B[gg]
;W[hf];B[ib];W[jb];B[ge];W[gf];B[ff]C[I have stretched my stones to the maximum to take all territory I can, knowing I have left some defects inside. Should I have played a better shape?

Basti: I think your moves are ok.];W[jf];B[ph]C[Basti: This leaves an open skirt. R10 looks natural.]
;W[qk]
(;B[oo]C[Now I had to deal with this area and reduce as much as possible.

Basti: It's difficult. Look at the variation for an alternative reduction technique.]
;W[np];B[qo];W[qq];B[ok]C[Is it the right point? White has taken later bigger territory that I thought initially.

Basti: I would make a base at R7.];W[qm];B[pl];W[ql];B[pn];W[rh]
;B[rg];W[qh];B[qg];W[pi];B[oi];W[pj];B[oj];W[sg];B[sf];W[sh]
;B[re];W[rn]C[I am not sure this was the best result for Black, but it was White's are ofinfluence to begin with.]
;B[kk];W[lg];B[mn];W[mi];B[mk]C[So I have managed to take some points also due to the K14 White group weakness.

Basti: The game looks about even now.];W[ko];B[cr]C[I thought this was the biggest point on the board.

Basti: This move and B8 seem to be miai.];W[bl];B[bk];W[dn]
;B[fa];W[db];B[rp]C[This is also big.];W[ir];B[rr];W[rq];B[sq]
;W[qr]C[At this point I have counted a very small lead for White and I knew that the one who plays the yose better wins. I appreciate your comment on the following moves to the end. Thanks!]
;B[lo];W[lp];B[kn];W[jo]
(;B[hr];W[jn]C[Basti: This is the last comment.
First of all you should always try to make a base for your weak stones. It gives you eyespace and points at the same time. You forgot to do so in the lower left and later on the right side. 
Also remember to play away from thickness even if it turned out good in this game because of white's passive answer at D8.
The right side stayed open for too long. You had several opportunities to play there.
I think your endgame was alright.];B[km];W[ak];B[aj];W[al];B[bj]
