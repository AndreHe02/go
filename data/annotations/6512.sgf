AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[FunHind [9k\]: hello!
sumioshi [5k\]: hello enjoy

This is a game I played with sumioshi, a 5k on the Kiseido go Server. As you can see, I played black.

Anyways, thank you for reviewing this game, I apreciate it. I am uncertain as to how to proceed, or even what questions to ask, simply because I am not sure at what strength I am at.

I will, however, explain what I was thinking with each move(not all of them, but most). I hope this will help you with each move.

Dr: My comments will have Dr:  in front of them];W[jc]C[I figured he wanted to build a base before he started attacking me. So it makes sense that he would play far away from my influence.

If I attack from either direction, he can extend in the opposite direction and press against one of my corner stones. With that in mind...]
;B[lc]C[I go here. I know he's going to extend, so I all ready know my next move, which should be about...]
;W[fd]
(;B[le]C[Here. I understand my left stone has a lot of pressure on it. In my experience however, capture is not inevitable yet, and the moyo gained on the right will sort of compensate in case  I get sealed in.

Dr: see thread];W[qn]C[He goes here. I was assuming he wanted to shake things up. not good in a handicap game to focus on one area.

Also, I think he was aiming at my moyo, because if I got a sansan, things would have been bad for him. If he extends upward, my moyo will have little potential for expansion.]
;B[qk]C[So I attack, and also extend a big of my moyo.
It's alittle shaky however. And I lose the moyo later in the game.]
;W[rp]C[Dr: see thread]
(;B[ok];W[nq]C[He's going for the corner. I think I mess up here.

Dr:  see thread]
(;B[pn];W[pm]
(;B[po]C[Dr:  see thread.  This seems heavy for b];W[ql]
(;B[qq]C[I did that to cut off O3 from the rest and attack.
Unfortunately, he uses his Q7 stone to extend and seal me in, resulting in MY capture. Suggestions?

Dr:  see thread];W[rq]C[Dr:  this w group is about alive];B[mo]
;W[kq];B[mq];W[mr]
(;B[mp]C[Dr:  see thread]
(;W[nr]C[Dr:  see thread - w could do better.];B[gq]C[Dr:  the large knights moves from 4-4 point are not territory. the w group is pretty much alive so no point in threatening it]
;W[iq]
(;B[ko]C[I shouldn't have wasted my breath with attacking his group.

Dr:  see thread];W[om]C[Not Good.];B[nn];W[qf]
(;B[qh]C[Dr:  see thread];W[rd]
(;B[rc];W[qc];B[qd];W[re];B[qb];W[of];B[pf];W[pg];B[pe];W[qg]

(;B[og]C[Dr:  see thread - this is a thank you move, forcing w to make a nice move]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[pj];B[pi];W[oh]
(;B[ng]C[Dr:  see thread, maybe better];W[oi];B[oj];W[pk]C[Dr:  now w has a large territory]
;B[qj];W[pl]
(;B[ni]C[Dr:  see thread];W[nh];B[mh]C[Dr:  this is hopeless.  too many cutting points]
;W[mg];B[nf];W[mi];B[lh]C[A rousing match. I get some territory on the upside, and he's fighting for his life.
Unfortunately, I can not afford to invest all of my effort into killing, as the chaneces of that happening get less and less likely. Not only that, but my R12 group is completely screwed.

So, while theres still room for expansion(namely, I can attack his upper white stones), he got the side. Still, I think the board position is overall better for me. simply because his stones are too low and ineficient.

Dr:  w has 30-40 points on the side.  a good chunck of the 65-70 points needed to win.  b has 20-25 points in UR, no other real territory]
;W[nj];B[nk];W[mk];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml];W[mm]
(;B[ll]C[Dr:  see thread];W[lk]C[That sequence was unexpected.]
;B[lm];W[cj]C[He thinks he is satisfied with what he's done. I'm not going to capture the white group. Right now I am at a cross roads, however. I'm not sure what to do.

Should I extend to C7, kind of putting pressure on the whtie stone?
No, because then he'll extend to C14. And then my D16 stone is in purgatory. Is this the price of developing my sides unevenly?!?

Dr:  game is hard for b now.  w has large lead in secure territroy as well as influence toward center.  b has no where to make an equally large territory.  See the threads - all the w groups are hard to kill now.

End of comments]
(;B[ie]C[What was I thinking when I made this move?

Well, I guess I still had the mindset of uneven development, expanding my paltry moyo on the upper right, and then really going downtown with L9, capping that sucker. It would have given me a divine upper hand in the game. Let's see how things played out?

Dr:  see thread];W[id];B[ih]C[Maybe too small?];W[je];B[hd]
;W[hc];B[he];W[jf]C[That wasn't too smart. I should have just blocked. It's too late now, however. So I decide to build up some sorely needed development on the left side. F16 looks RIPE. :)]
;B[fe];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ch]C[Now I have a good moyo! What's more, white will have to expand towards my strong D4 group. I still will have sente.]
;W[cn];B[cl]C[Of course, I wanted to split him up. If I could kill C10, then my moyo would be stupendous.

If on the other hand, I kill C6, things still look pretty good. If I was playing a 9k, things definitely would have worked in my favor.

alas, he is 5k...];W[ej]C[He extends to the moyo. I think it might have been better to play E8, forcing him to extend again, and then kill his C6 stone? That might have made things easier, as I have all ready determined to try and take it.

Instead however, I do this...(ugh)];B[dm]C[I think that was a little too eager. Suggestions?]
;W[bp];B[bq];W[cq];B[cp];W[br];B[bo];W[aq];B[co]C[I definitely have the white stone now! unfortunately, he has the corner. It's a fair trade. which isn't good. Well, maybe not. after all, I still have a fair amount of influence in the center. Maybe I can expand...?]
;W[dq];B[ik]C[Now I'm trying to kill the upper white stones. My weak spot, however, is around E12, definitely. Do you think a patch aroundd there, and then forcing him to run to M9 would have worked? After all, if I could secure the top and bottom, I would have two good moyo's, and he would have useless thickness.

How do things go from here...?];W[go]C[Ouch. completely out of the blue. I guess my stones were a little thin, because even if I cut G5 off from J3 with H4, he can connect to E3. uh-oh...]
;B[hp];W[ep];B[eq];W[er];B[eo];W[fq];B[fp]C[Ah, excellent. he wasn't able to connect. unfortunately, I have way too many cutting points...]
;W[ij];B[hj]C[i thought about the other wrap-around, with K10. y'know, fatten the cow before I slaughter. But I didn't want to give him too many stones to work with, because he's thrashing desperately. It's do or die, now, and I needed to be careful.

what next...?];W[ee]C[He's really making chaos.];B[ed];W[ec]
;B[gd];W[fc];B[gc];W[gb];B[ef]C[FunHind [9k\]: how am I doing?
I should have noticed his K14 stone. I'm putting my F15 group into big trouble by leaving that cutting point.

I wanted to connect at F14. then extend to C14.
I realize now, that that is reverse miai. so one of the options will be available to me, but he's going to put some serious presure on one of my groups. I courted the hand of death, and because that's the hand of a 5k, I paid dearly.]
;W[ff];B[de];W[gf];B[hf];W[ge];B[gg];W[fg]C[Agh! That move completely screws me over. I was expecting him to capture, and then I could seal him in. but this... things go downhill from here.

Now he might be able to save his two white stones. ayaiyai...]
;B[hg];W[fh];B[ee];W[cg]C[Not good, not good.];B[ei];W[fi];B[fj]

i hang in there for the rest of the game, and I would like to get some advice on the rest, but I really don't know what sort of questions to ask. I am bewildered as to how things just got real ugly real fast. The complexity of it all quickly overwhelmed me.

So, I will make very little comments from here on out, as my recognition of the game dwindles. I could use some help for this.]

Thank you for taking the time to review this game, and I look forward to it.
