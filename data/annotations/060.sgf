KM[0.5];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[po];W[od];B[pf]C[Second time I've played this move (actually before null game, but  commenting later).  Still unsure of its value.  getting away with it so far.

I don't know a lot of josekis -- but, at least locally, this looks like an
eminently reasonable move -- and it seems to be moving it the right direction,
towards your shimari in the lower right.];W[ld];B[qj]C[This move doesn't feel right to me -- but its hard to describe why.  If you want to
play on this side, it should probably be on the 4th line.


I think even more, I would prefer an extension along the bottom -- the choosing

of the high (5/4 rather than 5/3) shimari in the lower right emphasizes influence

along the lower side, so an extension to K4 (or, maybe, K3) would be nice.  Another
nice choice might the kakari at F3 -- and play to build strength towards your
shimari.  (Attach and extend would be fine if white chooses -- if white plays

a one point jump something like D2, W C3, then J3 is possible or even a matching

one point jump into the centre -- if white pincers a counter pincer would be a nice
choice.)];W[jp];B[fc];W[ic];B[hd]C[I like the simple one point jump into the centre here for black -- that is, F15.  It

gets you out farther, faster, and it is light.  This makes for white territory, and
black heaviness.];W[id];B[he]C[is this too slow?  Should I d18 now? or maybe g14 or something  faster?


You are correct this is too slow/too heavy.  D18 is grubbing for life -- that can

wait, you do want to keep moving out.  F15 is nice shape, F14 might be possible

(not normally, but the H16 stone has to be worth _something_).  G14 isn't bad either.

But, remember, you don't have to connect all your stones -- you can afford to let
on or two drop off the edges to keep the rest connected and together.];W
[df];B[dk]C[Very dangerous choice here.  You already have one weak group at the top, creating a

second weak group in close proximity is only asking for trouble, and a dead group.

You are giving white the perfect oppurtunity to make a splitting attack with chances
to kill either one -- or definitely take profit.


If you must play a stone on this side, 3rd line is probably better than fourth -- and

points to play at are C6 (normal kakari) or C12 (weak point of the white one point
jump like this.)


But the move D14 puts more pressure on your (weak) top group -- take care of it first,

before trying another invasion.  Something simple like J15 will help immensely -- then
follow up with another jump into the centre, or maybe a hane at K14 if white
plays the expected response of K15.];W[cm];B[ch];W[ec];B[fd];W[fg]C[White plays a severe attacking move...]
;B[lp]C[And black tenukis????


Essentially you gave up the upper side right here, and came close to giving up the   left side as well.  The status of black's two weak groups is the most important thing

on the board right now.  You must do something about them -- I think H13 is probably
best -- but J15 is also a possibility.


One group or the other can live by stealing, or threatening to steal,  the base

from white's corner group -- but in doing so, it will so strengthen white that the other
group, if it hasn't escaped yet, is almost sure to die.];W[gq]C[Of course, this move should be in the upper left as well...

But, even locally, this isn't right -- it is too small/slow.  Black can
still invade at the 3/3 point (C3) and live (I don't think this even gives
a ko.)   Far better to increase the size of the influence by jumping towards
the centre -- K6 (conservative) or K7 (better).  Because this is loose --
in both the K6 and K7 cases -- the choice of K7 looks better because it
is faster and larger.  The jump out also helps to reduce the potential
growth of the black moyo on the right.];B[nf]C[Locally, a good move -- builds nicely on the black moyo, and it threatens nastinesses like
O17 to the white group, but yadayada-UL-yadayada.];W[nd]C[White needs a move here, somewhere, but something like M14 is probably better -- it helps

a little with the weakness of the connection between M16 and P16, but more importantly
it is another barrier between the black H15 group and rescue.];B[ko]C[I don't think I would play this now.  Need to play on top to connect  with my weak group and simultaneously attack white upper group. (though it's  not weak)


As you have probably noticed -- I've been saying this for quite a while now. :-)]
;W[jo];B[kn]C[Can I hane instead?


Maybe, but I wouldn't.  This is more solid -- probably a better choice.  If you hane,
the white cut could get messy.];W[ie]C[Variations show other response than black H14 -- more comments on H14 with the move.]

(;B[hf]C[This move is too heavy, and too slow.  You are fighting inside white's influence, you

have to be make light, flexible, moves.  Be willing to give up some stones to get life

for others.  Something like H13 if you're trying to stay connected is better -- or   J13, allowing white to capture small (as shown in the variations on the previous move)

also gives black a nice result.   And, even when cut off, these black stones still have

a lot of aji -- the play at C17 -- threatening to either live, or connect to the black
F17 group is still available.


(See variation 1, in case you aren't familiar with the connection sequence.)]

(;W[di]C[White proceeds to execute a beautiful leaning attack on the left side black group,

in preperation for capturing the black upper group on a large basis.  This is very
nice play by white.];B[ci];W[dj];B[cj];W[dh];B[bf];W[bd];B[bl];W[ek]C[Black should not respond to this unless he feels that it threatens his life.  If black

ignores, I don't think white can kill -- the exact determination of this is left as an
excercise to the student. :-)


In fact, all the further moves in this corner are, unless they threaten to change the

life status of this group, too small compared to the unresolved centre situation.]
;B[dl];W[dm];B[bm]C[I bet this wasn't needed.  My side group seems fine now.  Perhaps I can yet  rescue my upper left stones had I not thrown this gote move.

As I noted a couple of moves ago, both players have played a couple more moves
here than they should have.];W[jj]C[This move by white is probably too aggressive/greedy, there is too much space between

it and the white group at J16 -- black might be able to force his way out through that

gap, though this is the right area to be playing in -- on the border between the black
and white moyo.  I think I would prefer K11, or maybe K12.

>arg.  I should reply now at m10?  my ul grp is dying.  I wonder if I saw  >that when I was playing?


Yes, your UL group is dieing, but it isn't dead yet.  One of J14, K13, or J12 would
be very interesting continuations -- especially J12.];B[bo]C[>surely I have better things to do.  My moyo is in serious danger, this group  >is alive (W & B) and I piddle around down south :(


This isn't small -- it is actually medium sized, but it isn't immediate, and more
importantly, it gives up on an invasion at C3/C4 (or maybe D4).];W[bp];B
[pc]C[>Same comment as before.  I am ignoring a huge threat to my biggest  >territorial potential and the ul group's life!  If I ignore center, I should  >at least try to make life for my unsettled grp rather than quibble with  >settled ones over territory.

This one is even smaller than the previous -- it was probably reasonable for
white to respond in the LL, but he shouldn't (and won't) respond here.]
;W[lj]C[Any move in this area is both big and important -- even this jump towards black helps

to make the capture of the black upper group more solid, but I would prefer a play

at K12 -- this makes the walling in absolute, and it leaves white with two very good

follow ups -- either K7 to complete his own moyo, or if black plays inwards on that,

side a reducing move in blacks moyo -- any of P10, O10, P11, and O11 look nice --
with the forcing move of P13 as a follow up.];B[nj]C[Black is kind of stuck now -- he no longer has much hope of rescuing his UL group,   and with this reduction by white, his moyo -- though big -- won't amount to enough.

O10 is probably the best of a bad situation.];W[jn];B[ll]C[This should be at N8 -- as we see from white's moves, the hole at N9 is glaring -- whereas

the play at N8 covers this hole.  It does leave a similar hole on the other side between

N8 and L6, but black is much stronger on that side -- so he can stave off a penetration   far more effectively -- or use the defense to setup up for a counter move into white's

sphere of influence.  If nothing else, fighting on the stronger side gives black far more

chance of ending the local fight in sente -- which can be quite important.  In fact white  may choose a less agressive push just to retain sente.]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[ml];B[om];W[mn]C[ fmaus 24k : Go?  or this invasion" :)


Properly speaking, this isn't an invasion -- it's a reduction.  An invasion is where a stone

is placed in the oppenents influence with a connection to life -- white is clearly connected
throughout this sequence.];B[no];W[km];B[lm]C[Connecting or not with this stone is fairly small, and definitely gote -- the escape at

E8 is far bigger, and thoroughly sente.  Your escape does threaten to capture the white
stone at N6, but this is relatively small.];W[el];B[me];W[md];B[mh]C[This feels too conservative for the situation -- I think you have to try to use the aji

of the dead group more -- moves to look at include K14 and K15, with thoughts about the
peep at L11 -- probably not as the initial move, but as a follow up to it.]
;W[kh];B[if]C[Too late.  Rather than push then pincer as you played -- try K14 (threat to connect) --
you are one row deeper that way.];W[jf];B[kf]C[
 hchen 23k*: are u experiencing some net lag?];W[jg];B[ih]C[This black group is dead -- playing more stones isn't going to help it, so you should

be playing big/sente plays elsewhere.  L8 is reasonably important, and O18 is quite  large.]
;W[kl];B[mm]C[This is small, gote, and as you notice later -- it doesn't work either.]
;W[mj]C[White is worried about the pushing sequence starting with M9, cutting off too many stones,

or breaking in to the territory.   But white can always give up the two stones at N9 and

N8 rather than letting black in -- so this move is too small at this point -- a move around
P17/P18 is big, as would be L3, C5, and a move around C15/B15.    As to why I suggest C15 -- consider the variations I start at variation 1 -- if black
plays C17.]
(;B[eb]C[E18 isn't going to work -- black can't get enough eye space.  The play of C17 (as  
followed by variations on the previous move) is far more interesting, and is definitely
blacks best hope here.];W[db];B[ed];W[dc];B[fa];W[gb];B[hb];W[fb];B[gc]
