C[This was an even game with another 18kyu player, we played with 25mins each, which is a speed I'm mildly comfortable with, though I play much slower in games with live opponents.

I've never had a game reviewed before, so I'm essentially just looking for my basic strengths and weaknesses, and how best I could improve towards a single-digit kyu player.

TsuQ: Heya! Happy to review your game =\]... I'll label my comments like this, if you have trouble with the labels showing up wrong, or seeing the variations, I'm doing this review in Cgoban3, so try using that if theres a problem. Lets go!]
;B[pd];W[dd]C[TsuQ: By choosing a corner directly across, you give your opponent the choice of playing a cross corner game by playing in the bottom left. These games tend to have a lot of fighting, so if you're confident your fighting is better, this is conceptually good.]
;B[qq]C[TsuQ: Both sides have to agree though =P. Looks like B would rather play a calmer game.]
;W[dq]LB[co:A]C[TsuQ: A is the most natural approach point to the 3-4. If black plays there and you answer on the bottom, your two stones will be comfortably split. Usually you want as many of your stones as possible working together toward a common goal.]
;B[nc];W[cj]C[TsuQ: Good choice conceptually, both of your stones on the left were 'high', on the 4th line from the left side of the board, so a move in this area has the most potential right now.]
;B[qj]C[Up to now everything seemed pretty standard to me.]
;W[jq]LB[fc:A][cj:D][co:C][do:B]C[Here though I didn't know where to go with my fuseki

TsuQ: well normally you would play something either here, or on the top. This is big since it's an extension from both your groups, and the largest gap on the board. The top is big because although the gap is smaller, you have a higher stone in that area. I'd be inclined toward the top, because if black approaches low there, say at A, you have to deal with the corner right away, and the pincer isn't so good because O17 is low and therefore hard to attack in comparison. B is another option to complete the corner enclosure,  C also works for that, but B works better with the D stone. After this move, B looks very attractive for you, since it helps the corner, and makes your extension on the bottom and left more valuable.]
;B[lq]
(;W[ic]LB[do:C][jo:A][lo:B][jq:E][lq:D]C[TsuQ: D is an odd move by black, it encourages you to play the A, black B, white C sequence, which is better for you since there is more space being claimed in your area. Playing a low move on the top as you did is also big to help protect against the approach, but the bottom seems more urgent. Black can now try to put pressure on the corner and the E stone at the same time by playing between them. Any compensation you get from attacking the D stone in return, will probably not be worth the damage to your corner.]
;B[jp]
(;W[iq]LB[ip:B][kp:A][iq:C]C[What is the best response here? I believe a proverb goes "respond to contact with hane", So perhaps that would have been best?

TsuQ: This is quite an aggressive move by black. He's enlarging his potential by getting more influence in the center, and at the same time it is now harder for you to do the same (and now, your area will be smaller.) This is a submissive, but solid move, black should have to continue locally at some point, or a move at A will undo all the benefit of this move. The hane at B was also good locally, but may have compelled you to respond again at some point after black defended his stone because of the weakness it leaves behind - the cutting point at C.]
;B[jd]C[TsuQ: Ok this move makes black's intention clear, he wants to make one big framework out of his stones to try to get a large portion of the center, at this point, you should be thinking about making sure you have a way into that area since you won't be able to grow your side as large as he potentially can (although you have some advantages on the top side especially.)]
;W[id];B[if]C[TsuQ: This is way to thin for black, you should punish him.]
;W[je]C[I didn't like his knight's move here, but I'm unsure my hane was a great response

TsuQ: No, this is very good =\]... K16 is almost useless now, and J14 is isolated in the area of your influence. Moreover, you have broken into the center area he was trying to claim, so now the center top is mostly ruined for him as potential territory.]
;B[kd]
(;W[jf]LB[ie:A]C[TsuQ: This is a nice aggressive follow up, I like it =\]... A would have meen more straightforward, but this is potentially more profitable.]
;B[ie];W[ig]C[TsuQ: good.];B[hf]
(;W[jg]LB[fc:C][lf:A][hg:B]C[TsuQ: hmm, I'm not so sure I like this. You have some other options like A threatening to attack the L16 group, or pushing at B, then defending the top with C and fighting it out. The man problem with this, is that J17 is not very well connected to the corner, so if black attacks it from H14, it could become tricky.]
(;B[fe]LB[fc:A][hg:B]C[Often my online games turn out like this, where both players are kind of flying around wherever. What would be a good way to punish here, or to neaten up the game?

TsuQ: This is very nice of black =P, you should secure your top immediately with A. Pushing at B first may be even better if you can handle the ladder breakers black has.]
(;W[gf]LB[hg:A]C[TsuQ: What I don't like about this move, is that if black pushes out at H13, which is something he'd like to do anyway. you now have a stone that's sitting there isolated. You're playing into a very solid cut.]
;B[ge]
(;W[gd]LB[hg:A]C[TsuQ: aww, this is too sad. Black gave you the opportunity to connect the other stones in sente with A. Now if black plays A, your center stones can come under attack and G14 is completely isolated again.  Also G16 isn't very good at doing the one thing it really should do, connect the top. One proverb says something along the lines of it's better to do one thing well, then two things badly.]
;B[gg]
(;W[ff]LB[fd:A]C[TsuQ: yes, this ladder doesn't work for black. He can however get a good bit of strength from giving up on it. Playing at A and letting him have the single stone might have been another option, but it's very unfortunate because the center stones will be in a LOT of trouble.]
;B[ef];W[fg];B[ed]LB[eg:A]C[TsuQ: yes, this is the kind of idea of giving up on the ladder. Black could also push again at A first.]
(;W[fd]LB[ec:A]C[TsuQ: trying to connect with A first was the better option I think.]
(;B[de];W[hg]C[TsuQ: at this point, black should probably give these up since I think he can kill the corner in exchange.]
(;B[he];W[ec];B[eg]C[TsuQ: ah, the push I was talking about earlier. This will make black a bit stronger locally.]
;W[fh];B[gh]LB[ee:A]C[TsuQ: this though is a big overplay. white can now take the ko at E15 and black has nothing even approaching the value of that ko to threaten with.]
;W[ee]C[TsuQ: good.];B[fi]
(;W[eh]C[TsuQ: this complicates things unneededly. Just taking the stones is good, check the board position =\]]
;B[ed];W[dg];B[ee]LB[qc:A][qd:B][nq:C]C[This ko exchange... how could I have handled it better?

TsuQ: by taking his stones as soon as possible =\]... unfortunately this ko is bigger than anything on the board, so ko threats like A, B, or C, aren't really going to win it. On the positive side, black isn't out of the woods yet =\]]
(;W[ce]LB[dc:A]C[TsuQ: I think here I would say, always expect your opponent to make the best move possible. This seems like an overplay. Maybe just connecting at A would be better.]
;B[dc];W[cd]
(;B[fc]
(;W[eb]LB[df:A]C[TsuQ: yes, this is quite unfortunate, you cannot save every stone. Maybe playing at A right away would give a better result.]
;B[hd];W[gc];B[hc]
(;W[fb]LB[gb:A]C[TsuQ: A would have been better.];B[hb]LB[fc:A]
C[TsuQ: now this threatens to take the group at A, and cuts off the J17 stones 'for free']
;W[ib]LB[cb:B][gb:A]C[TsuQ: this is just not possible.White needs to play A or something around B.]
(;B[jb];W[ha]LB[gb:B][df:A]C[TsuQ: This is a reasonable recovery, but the other moves that remove a black liberty, A and B, are probably both better.]
;B[jc]C[I was in a bad position here I think, could I have handled those seperated stones better?

TsuQ: Yes... I would say one thing to take from this is not to add onto stones that are dead. If you could see they were lost, you could have used your moves to get other benefits. Also try to keep your groups connected, and avoid cutting yourself, that's a broad summary of this fight =\]]
;W[gb]LB[df:A][ch:C][ei:B]C[TsuQ: Yes you get this move or A for free here. Both fix a problem so this is fine. It's probably slightly better than A, because if you went to defend that cut now, you might rather do it at B or C.]
;B[ia];W[ga]LB[dh:B][gi:A]C[TsuQ: This is a sad move =[... It's a common problem however, just because you can save a stone (especially locally) doesn't mean that you should. D17 should be dead, so this move should be small. in exchange, black is going to get to get one of these moves instead of you.]
;B[cb]LB[ea:C][db:B][ch:A]C[ TsuQ: This actually makes your last move good. There is no danger to your top group while B and C are miai (if they play one, you play the other., so you can fix your problems on the left. A is the most obviously successful way to do that, although you might find a better move with some more reading to make sure nothing dies =\].]
(;W[db];B[cc];W[bc]C[TsuQ: It is not so important in this position to capture the stones, as to make sure they don't have two eyes, and you do. If you try too hard to capture, you might end up hurting yourself.]
;B[dh];W[ei];B[cg];W[gi]C[TsuQ: this helps your stones in the center a lot, but the corner situation has become trickier than it would have been if you played a move in this area before black.]
(;B[hh];W[hi];B[ih];W[ji]C[TsuQ: good, this net fixes the problem of your stones in the center.]
;B[di]
(;W[fj]LB[ej:A]C[TsuQ: again, consider extending instead.];B[ej]
;W[fi];B[dl]LB[dg:B][dh:A][dj:C]C[TsuQ: woah... thats an aggressive move. Normally it wouldn't be possible at all, but the A stones are connected through the B capture. Just black playing C would be more solid, and white would still have to respond.]
;W[dj];B[ek]C[This is probably where things became worst for me, how should I have handled the next 20 or so moves (up to where my fairly big group died)?]
;W[ch];B[df];W[ci];B[dg]
(;W[bg]LB[bl:A][cl:B]C[TsuQ: Up to this move your reaction is good, not so sure about this though... it's a matter of whether or not you can get away with it, if you can, it's probably best. The other option is to skip out in the other direction with A or maybe even B.]
;B[bf];W[ah]
(;B[bd]C[TsuQ: this is a bit of a mistake by black I think. Nope, this is actually right =P]
;W[bb];B[be];W[ca];B[cf]C[TsuQ: not a bad result considering.]
(;W[cn]LB[bl:A]C[wow, what was I thinking? I guess I didn't realize how under threat that group was!

TsuQ: yes, this is nice for the corner, but if this doesn't actually connect, which it doesn't look like it does, that group should die =/... It's difficult, but try to re-evaluate the situation when something big changes like this invasion. The white stones which were safe before because they seemed to be connected, are now all alone =[... something like A would be the simplest way to secure them.]
;B[bl]
(;W[ck]LB[cl:A][dm:B]C[TsuQ: this is no good at all =[... you only make black stronger. It is a 'thank you' move. If nothing else, you can add a stone to the corner in such a way that black has to respond. The threat of playing A (instead of this move) might work to help you even if it doesn't work outright. B instead for example.]
;B[cl];W[bk]LB[fl:A]C[making an empty triangle here... probably should have realized that wasn't good haha

TsuQ: Again, you should expect your opponent to play the best move =\]... This is good to save for a ko threat, since black will have to answer this or you live. At this point the only hope for these stones if it's worth trying to save them, is to try to cut black off from the center with something like A, forcing it into a local fight. Even if you don't win, if you do a good job enclosing black, you will profit on the outside. Capture, Kill, Enclose, Sacrifice, each is useful at different times.]
(;B[ak]
(;W[bi]LB[aj:A]C[TsuQ: A gave you better fighting chances, although it doesn't live outright.]
;B[aj]C[Lyzl [18k\]: god I hate life and death

(comment in game chat)];W[am]C[ifeel [18k\]: :D

TsuQ: This is actually a good move conceptually, you gain a little more security in your corner while giving up nothing but your already dead group (and a ko threat)]
;B[al];W[el]C[TsuQ: this might very well work to cut off black's group from the center, if you were thinking to do that =\]. as a cutting threat, it's not too helpful =P]
(;B[fl]C[TsuQ: not the best answer by black.. this makes it easier on you to cut him off from the center.]
;W[em]LB[kp:A]C[once I realized it was dead, I though I handled getting a nice wall from it OK, what do you think?

TsuQ: the gain in the corner from this is pretty decent. The eventual wall toward the center is nice, as long as you get something like A to turn it into something useful. If black connects, you won't get as much in the area as the wall should because black is already 'too close' to your wall, but with a strong enough group.]
(;B[ag]C[TsuQ: this is a silly move...]
(;W[af]LB[fk:A]C[you can play A first to get a better wall to the center.]
;B[ae]LB[ai:A]C[TsuQ: this is anothermistake by black, should be at A.]
(;W[fk]LB[ai:A]C[TsuQ: Now you can play at A, if you really want to (now or in the future) and fight a difficult ko, but a ko none the less =P.]
;B[dk];W[dm]LB[kp:A]C[TsuQ: yes, this is a very nice wall toward the center. A move at A is becoming more vital now for both sides.]
(;B[ag];W[bm];B[bh]C[TsuQ: This is now only a 2-step ko. If white wins this ko twice, he can save his group.]
(;W[io]LB[mf:B][kp:A]C[once my wall came to fruition, I thought it would be good to create a nice moyo in the bottom left corner. It seemed to work out for me, but should I have been taking this time to invade?

TsuQ: really, this isn't bad, but A is the bigger point, it threatens more, and you have plenty of strength to back it up. Invading his corner in the upper right is also big, so is jumping into his territory around B. I think A is the biggest point though. You had the right idea here I think.]
;B[hn]LB[in:A]C[TsuQ: you should really read this one out to see if it's a credible threat, because what you really want to play here is A.]
(;W[gm]LB[in:A]C[TsuQ: Yeah this seems to capture territory on a smaller scale. I think you could get away with A.]
(;B[gl];W[hl];B[gk];W[hk];B[hj]C[I got lucky with a bunch of stones he was just handing to me, and giving me the influence I need to start harassing the right side.

TsuQ: Yes, his attempt to cut you is just not going to work, making you stronger and stronger in the area you most want to secure for yourself.]
;W[ij];B[lg]LB[lf:A]C[TsuQ: this is slightly too far, should probably be at A.]
(;W[kh]LB[lf:A]C[TsuQ: and A is probably the best response here as well. Bowl like territory shapes tend to be weak against invasion, so this shouldn't really gain you much in the lower left, but he becomes stronger in the upper right.]
;B[in];W[jo]C[TsuQ: good!];B[kp]
(;W[jm]LB[jn:B][ip:A][iq:C]C[TsuQ: I think it would be easier to connect at A and deal with the push at k6 after. The C stones are weak once he cuts.]
;B[jn];W[kn]
(;B[lo]LB[ip:A]C[TsuQ: the sequence after this is quite odd for me, because the cut at A is huge for a long time...]
;W[ko];B[ln];W[lm];B[kl];W[im]LB[km:A][ip:B]C[TsuQ: A cut at A, and-or B, would be very difficult for white to handle right now. At the very least black would get several moves to build a wall.]
(;B[km];W[ll]LB[lk:C][kl:A][ll:B][ip:D]C[I was thinking that with my influence, splitting him into many weak groups should be beneficial to me.

TsuQ: More specifically, it's beneficial for you where you are strong, and beneficial for him where he is strong. Here, you are much stronger around A, than he is around B, so you should win that fight. He should probably play C immediately to try to shore up his territory. (ignoring the cut at D, which is also quite big.)]
(;B[kk];W[lk];B[lj]C[TsuQ: yes, right idea for black, but now the wall isn't nearly as good.]
;W[kj];B[li]LB[mm:A]C[TsuQ: I think A would have been better, but this also makes some sense.]
;W[jk]LB[lf:D][lh:E][li:F][kl:B][ll:A][mm:C][ip:G]C[TsuQ: Here you are being very eager to capture stones again =\]... As long as your A group has more liberties than his B group, there is no urgency to this. C would have been a simple alternative that would be more useful. but right now the big area is D and E. If you can break through around here, the F stones will have much less meaning... (and of course the cut at G)]
;B[lh];W[mn]C[TsuQ: An issue with this, is that if he cuts you, you can't connect. You will get some forcing moves though to reduce his territory, so that's good too.]
(;B[mo]C[TsuQ:  this is bad by B];W[nn];B[op]
(;W[kq]C[TsuQ: ahh, because J4 and H4 will be atari, this actually doesn't fix the cut, even though it looks like it does =P]
;B[mp]LB[qc:A][lf:B][bg:C][ip:D]C[TsuQ: here black randomly makes a false eye... there are still moves around A and B that are worth playing... and that 2 step Ko at C. (and of course, D)]
;W[lr]C[TsuQ: This is quite small at the moment];B[mr];W[ip]
C[TsuQ: Yay! =\]];B[lp];W[no]C[TsuQ: Ooh, I really like this. You give up M2, but if black takes it, you will gain more from pushing down clear to O3 and forcing black to live.]
(;B[np]C[TsuQ: black catches that =\]];W[pn];B[on]
(;W[om]LB[oo:A]C[TsuQ: very sensible, A leaves too many weaknesses.]
;B[oo]LB[qc:B][lf:C][bg:D][ip:A]C[hmmm, I felt most of this was decent

TsuQ: Except for the timing of A, and choosing some smaller moves over B, C, and D, this section is okay.]
(;W[pl]LB[ol:B][nm:A]C[TsuQ: it's difficult to see, but theres a weakness here you need to take care of around A, I think you can defend both sides with B instead.]

Suppose that's about it, what did you think?

TsuQ: Here's a summary, first, consider sacrificing. If you can, train yourself whenever you see only one stone at risk to consider sacrificing it. This will prevent you from making very small moves (62), or getting into bad situations to avoid small losses (50) (254). Similarly, consider twice before taking a stone, sometimes enclosing it or ignoring it are just as good (54) (76) (146). Watch your connections, in general, don't play a stone that can be easily cut off (24), or let a weak group be separated (22) (32) (66) (94) (130) (172). Do one thing well rather than two things badly (26). Re-evaluate the situation when a group gets cut off or captured. This way you won't end up letting groups die when they didn't need to (34) (184 etc.) (214), or live when they shouldn't be able to. Don't over extend hoping for the best, expect your opponent to make the best move he possibly can (46) (56) (98). Don't attack while standing on one foot (66) (184) (206) make sure the group you are attacking with is secure before trying to kill the group nearby. Capturing, Killing, Enclosing and Sacrificing to them, are all useful ways to handle battles between weak groups. Ko's are difficult, but hopefully, you got some idea how they work with the examples in this game =\]... I hope you found this review helpful, let me know =\]]
