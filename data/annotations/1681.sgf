C[Schaeferhjue:
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

how is the final result of this game?
In this game I am especially interested in the status of the black group in the right upper corner, is it dead or not ?
And why is it so, could you please give a short explanation to a beginner ?

Many thanks in advance !


bignose:
Since you've asked about the end of the game (the result, and the status of a group) I've answered those questions on the final position -- view the last node to see my comments there.

I've also added some comments throughout the game, so you might want to move through the game to see those.  I've explored other possibilities in variations where appropriate.

Unfortunately the game as supplied didn't have information on whether you (Schaeferhjue) played Black or White, so I can't focus on your play; I'll make some comments on both sides.  You may want to set up your software to record details of name, ranking, and so forth for each game, so that future games can be reviewed more effectively.

My recommendations for Black are to remember the proverb "Corners first, then side, then centre".   This is a principle that can be demonstrated easily but is difficult for many beginners to put into practice, so conscious reminding can help.

Both players also need to consider the whole-board situation more often; in many instances, especially during the opening, each player was responding automatically to the opponent when there were much more important plays elsewhere on the board.  Deciding to give up a local opportunity to play elsewhere is called "tenuki" and is an important principle to learn if one does not wish to be constantly led around the board.]
;B[dc];W[dp];B[cq]C[bignose: This move is not important; it attempts to take the corner, but the other two corners are empty and a play in either of those would be much better.]
;W[dq]LB[pp:a][pd:b]C[bignose: Since the other empty corners are worth more at this stage, White can afford to ignore Black's play.

White should take a second corner around 'a' or 'b'.];B[cp]
;W[co]LB[pp:a][pd:b]C[bignose: This is a good move for shutting Black in; it is known as "playing at the head of two stones" and severely limits Black's options with the two-stone group.

However, the other two empty corners at 'a' and 'b' are still much more valuable than playing in this area.  Either of Black or White would gain far more by playing there before returning attention to this corner.]
;B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq]C[bignose: This completes a standard sequence of moves known to give a reasonably even result to both Black and White in the local area (there are thousands of these sequences, called "joseki" by the Japanese).  However, playing it out to completion, when there are two empty corners, was poor play for both Black and White -- either could have profited greatly by taking one of the empty corners.]
;B[pc]C[bignose: Black gets a huge advantage now; although the game started out even, Black now has a solidly secure corner (lower left) and a firm stake on two more (the top left and right), whereas White has little to show for his plays.]
;W[qe];B[rc];W[od];B[nb];W[pp]C[bignose: Finally, White plays the last empty corner.]
;B[qq]C[bignose: Black is allowing himself to be pressed down low, against the edge of the board, while White has gained large amounts of influence over the rest of the board.  With this move, Black is essentially conceding the lion's share of the board to White while Black's territory is restricted to the corners.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq]
;W[qn]LB[ce:a]C[bignose: Again, sequences like these look nice in books but they are rarely played out all in one burst.  As the position becomes more settled, a play in a less developed area of the board is worth more than completing the sequence in the corner.

At any time during this corner sequence, a play at 'a' would have been much more valuable for either Black or White.]
;B[pj]C[bignose: Black does need to ensure that these large areas don't become entirely White territory, but has left it quite late to do so.

In the many fights that take place later in the game, you will see that White's strength facing along the sides and into the centre of the board cause Black to be at a big disadvantage.  As a result, much of the areas of White influence get turned into solid White territory, giving the game to White.]
;W[qh]C[bignose: This play is a good response to Black's move, securing the upper White group and leaving the Black stone uncomfortably pressed toward White's strong wall on the lower right.]
;B[og];W[oh];B[pf];W[pe];B[ne];W[nd];B[kd];W[me];B[ki]LB[ci:a]
[cf:b][ce:c]C[bignose: Black is making the common beginner mistake of placing too little importance on the corners and sides, where territory is easy to gain, and too much importance on the centre, which is much more difficult to turn into territory and only becomes important once the corners and sides are developed.

A play at 'a', 'b' or 'c' would be far preferable to this move.]
;W[mh];B[pi];W[ph];B[mj];W[qf]LB[ce:a][de:b][fc:c][ic:d]C[bignose: White is responding to Black moves too easily.  The three Black stones have already been surrounded, and Black's move does not threaten White, so White now has the opportunity to shift the focus of the game (this is known as "sente", or "initiative).

A White play at 'a' or 'b' would be much better.  Even an approach at 'c', threatening to follow up at 'd', would be much better than this move.]
;B[nm];W[ce]C[bignose: A good move, using White's strength in the lower left to create a large influence along the left side, inviting Black to invade and cause a repetition of what happened on the right side.  More importantly, it denies Black an easy extension along the left side.  Black has few places left to make territory.]
;B[mo]LB[ee:a][df:b][kf:c]C[bignose: Black seems to be trying to surround territory in the centre, which is always inefficient.

Instead, Black could respond to White's move by playing 'a' and have the option of following up with 'b' or 'c', depending on White's response.  These sort of moves attack the opponent while helping create territory.]

;W[pl];B[nl];W[hl];B[iq];W[bi];B[ik];W[hk]C[bignose: At this point the game is essentially over; White has secured an enormous territory on the left side -- almost one third of the board -- that is secure enough around the edge and with enough eye shape that Black cannot hope to invade.  Black has no secure territory that even approaches the size of this White side, and Black's groups are quite weak on the right side so he cannot hope for much territory there either.  Black cannot win from here.]

;B[jl]LB[sg:a]C[bignose: Saving these stones in the centre is not important; Black should instead be looking to gain eyes for his groups on the right side.

If Black plays 'a', he will connect his right side and top right corner together, making the combined group more likely to live.  Ensuring groups are connected (and, conversely, splitting the opponent into separate groups) is an important principle in Go.]

(;W[rb]C[bignose: This position is a tricky one, as often happens in the corner.  This is a classic life-and-death problem -- assuming perfect play from both Black and White, what is the status of the Black group?

I don't pretend to know for certain, but I think the Black group cannot be killed (assuming, as always, no mistakes from either side).  When a group surrounds a space of more than six or seven points, it generally cannot be prevented from forming two eyes.  Even six-or-seven point spaces are secure under most circumstances.  This group surrounds an eight-point space, so killing it is probably impossible.

If there were a White move that prevents Black from living, this is a good choice.  I will explore some alternative sequences as branches to the main line of play.]

[rr][rs][si][sj][sq][sr][ss]LB[sc:a][sa:b]C[bignose: This is the score once dead groups are removed.  White has a 54-point lead in territory, adding the 5.5 point komi makes the result a win to White by 59.5 points.

The situation in the top right corner is known as "dual life" (the Japanese call it "seki").  Groups are only dead at the end of the game if they cannot avoid capture; but here, neither side can move to capture the other, since a play by either Black or White at 'a' or 'b' leaves the player's own group in atari, and it would be captured on the next move.  Since whoever moves first in this situation will die, neither player will do so; since neither group can be killed, they both stay on the board.  The intersections between them ('a' and 'b') are not controlled by either side, so they do not count toward either player's score.  Black does have two points surrounded, so they each count toward the Black score.

In the variations played in this corner, we saw that this was caused by White's initial move inside this Black group, and that there was little Black could to to avoid the seki.  It allowed White to get a better result in this corner than a certain live group for Black, and killing the Black group was not possible.

Although most groups end up alive or dead, sometimes it is possible for a nearly-dead group or a nearly-alive group to be forced into seki by skillful play; the difference in score can easily be enough to change the result of an otherwise close game, so it is worthwhile remembering this possibility.]
