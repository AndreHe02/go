yeah, yeah. This looks like a blunder since W can capture either O2 or N3.]
;W[mr];B[or];W[lq]C[W gets a wunderful ponnuki and B has to add another move in the corner.]
;B[rq];W[kp]C[A very thick move, but also very slow. I would like to make a shimari in the lower left or an extension along the upper side. B doesn't get a good result if he sets his lonly stone into motion because W is already very strong.   But since W gets thickness which also reenforces the lower left, its not really a bad move.]
;B[lo]C[Oops. Give away the stone. Now the stones are heavy and B can attack to enlarge the lower left.]
;W[ko];B[ln];W[co]C[This is the right idea, but I would push once more because now the B turn at L6 still creates some aji at L3.]
;B[pp]
(;W[kn]C[I would prefer to play at Q5 and to sacrifice two stones because the two stones would still have some aji.]
;B[po];W[nn];B[on];W[lm];B[dr];W[cr];B[nm];W[mn]C[Should be at N7.]
(;B[cq]C[I don't have [Takemiya: Enclosure Joseki. Ishi press\] at hand, but this looks dubious because B doesn't have a good answer to C4.]

(;W[er]C[Oops. This is very bad because C5 becomes separated. W has to play C4 first.]
;B[dp];W[ds]C[Must be at E3 because the atari at E3 is unbearable.];B[eq]
;W[dr];B[cp];W[ep];B[eo]C[Just playing at D5 looks better because B either keeps sente or the aji of E3.]
;W[fq];B[do];W[fo]C[This result is bad for W because he is overconcentrated and C5 has become meaningless.]
;B[dm];W[cj];B[cn];W[cg];B[jd];W[hc];B[cc]C[Yes. W literally begs for this invasion.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[fb];B[bf]C[Looks dangerous, but I didn't find a way to kill the corner.]
;W[ce];B[ae];W[bg];B[ba];W[db];B[cb];W[ea];B[ab];W[qf]C[This is asking for trouble. The usual move is P15, but may Q10 or Q11 are also ok. Now W has no way to get a base.]
;B[qh];W[of];B[oh]C[Good.];W[mf];B[md];W[jb]C[I don't think W can afford to play tenuki.]
;B[lf]C[Attaching is seldom a good way to attack. N12 or M15 the proper moves to attack (I don't know which is better in this case).]
