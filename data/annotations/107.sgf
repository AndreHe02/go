[dc][jc][jd][df]C[This narrow pincer induces a white  invasion at the 3-3 point. If black
blocks at 'a' to build a wall facing down the left side, white will get
sente to play at 'b', which reduces the wall's influence a great deal.
But if black blocks at 'c' instead, the marked stone will become too
close to the wall to be efficient. Therefore, to play this narrow pincer,  black would like to have a stone around 'b' himself.

A pincer at 'd' or 'e' would let black block at 'c'
without becoming overconcentrated. Such a pincer would also work much better  together with the handicap stone in upper right.
The standard move at 'f' is also good.];W[cf];B[fd];W[cc];B[cd]L[ec]
C[How about 'a' to get  sente and a strong position at the top?];W[ec]
(;B[ed]M[ec][fc]C[Var. B to take hold of corner and get an attack on the marked  stones
could be an interesting alternative.];W[dc];B[he]L[dj]C[The "proper" move which makes good aji. Unfortunately, white gets
a chance to destroy the influence of the wall by playing on the
left side. Therefore, black might consider to play somewhere around 'a'  instead.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[ck]C[Very satisfactory for white.];B[ci]L[cm]
[ch]C[Looks too close to the wall; black easily becomes overconcentrated.
Black should probably play 'a' instead, though it is regretful to let
white extend ('b') towards the wall above. Black has to be satisfied with
sente, more influence in the lower part and that white's move 'b' doesn't
have any attacking value at all.];W[cn];B[co]C[Good style,  making white overconcentrated.]
;W[dn];B[fp];W[di]
(;B[dj]C[Appears to be the right move, using the thickness above for  fighting, but
since the stone can be caught in a ladder, maybe still not the best move.

How about B (see variations), which looks like a bad move at first
(white gets "hane on head of two stones") but seems to work better?];W[cj]
;B[dh];W[ei];B[eh];W[fi]L[ch]M[dh][eh]C[This is a bad result for black, compared with the variations  shown;
His marked stones are far too close to the wall above, and there is
still the cutting point at 'a' for white, so black makes very little
territory here. Furthermore, white's group on the left side is strong.]
;B[qn];W[pl];B[on]L[pi]C[This move aims at an counter pincer  around 'a' which would work well
together with the handicap stone above.];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[rq]L[pi]
C[This should be in the neighbourhood of  'a'.];W[pf];B[nd];W[qd];B[qc]
;W[qe];B[rc]L[oc][pc]C[This move leaves invasion aji at  'a'. 'b' is an alternative.]
;W[qj]M[on][qn][rp][rq]C[Now black's  marked stones are rather useless. Remember that white
had only one stone in this region to start with.];B[mn];W[jq];B[lq]L[oq]

;W[po];B[oo];W[nm];B[nn];W[ko];B[fn]L[gn][eo]M[dp][fp][fn]C[Good  sense of direction, but at 'a' instead would make 'b' less of
a weakness. The three marked stones constitutes a somewhat bad shape.];W

[im];B[ll];W[il];B[nf];W[jk];B[ph]L[qh][pi]C[This isn't the best invasion  point. It only strengthens white,
since he can connect under black's stone. Better to invade one point deeper at
'a', or just reduce with a shoulder hit at 'b'.];W[qh];B[qg];W[pg];B[qi]
;W[rh];B[pi];W[ri]L[nh]C[Now white threatens to attack the marked stones at 'a',  so black's
"invasion" was no success.];B[rl];W[rm];B[qm];W[rn];B[ro];W[rr];B[ql];W

such plans. It doesn't protect much territory either.  'a' would be more of a treat to white's eye shape (it makes the
"angle tesuji" with respect to the two marked white stones, see
"Attack & Defense"). Anyway, better to let white crawl along the first
line and live in gote and try to make some territory around 'b', starting
with a reducing move, at 'c' perhaps.];W[le];B[lg];W[jd];B[ld]L[kc]C

;W[ke];B[lf];W[jg];B[cm]L[bm][hq][bi][fh]C[A play here should of course be at 'a'  instead to prevent the cut,
but it isn't necessarily sente, and thus there are bigger moves  (e.g. 'b', 'c' and 'd').]

As pointed out earlier, black should have played 'a' atari,
white fills at 'b' and then leave it as a forcing
exchange. That sacrifice would have made white's current move gote.];B[or]

chance to play 'b' in sente later. This is the most effective way to
stop white. At least 4 points better than the move played.];W[pa];B[qb]
