C[Thank you very much for your time. MY game is low level so it shouldn't take very long. Thank you again

edgy:  This was a very interesting game!  You showed grat fighting spirit.  I think you need to work on picking fights where you can make profit even if you don't kill the opponent's group.]

;B[cc];W[cj];B[eh];W[gf]
(;B[cn]LB[hd:A]C[edgy: This starts a big fight.  It might have been better to play at 'A' and make some profit while attacking.  See variation.]
;W[cl];B[bp];W[cq]
(;B[dk]TR[ch][eh]C[edgy: Perhaps a less energetic approach might have been better, since Black's marked stones are also weak.]
;W[ck];B[dj];W[dl];B[en];W[fl]TR[cn][en][bp]C[edgy: Now the white C10 group is actually stronger
than before, and the marked Black group before is in danger of getting pressed between the White positions above and below.]
;B[df]C[edgy: This works out well for Black, but  I'm not sure it should have.]

(;W[dg]C[I want to know if the wedge was a good idea in this position.

edgy: I think your group around C12 is too weak for this to work; see the variation.]
;B[de];W[eg];B[cg];W[dh];B[di];W[ci];B[bf]TR[eh][di][dj][dk]
[cn][en][bp]C[edgy: This way, Black has secured a nice big corner territory, although the marked stones are all weak.  (In fact, I think the group around D10 is dead.)]
;W[ei];B[ej]
(;W[fi]C[edgy: I think White missed a chance to kill the Black group with a squeeze tactic here.  See the variation.]
;B[fj];W[gj];B[gi];W[fh];B[gk];W[hj];B[fk]C[edgy: Now Black has managed to get the head of his group into the center.]

(;W[el]C[edgy: I don't think this was White's best move.  See variation.]
;B[hk]LB[gl:A][gn:B]C[edgy: Black's next move shows that you had the right idea here, but 'A' might have been slightly stronger.  White could try 'B' now to develop the C8 group.]
;W[ij];B[hm]TR[ci][ck][cl][dl][el][fl]C[edgy: This is a good idea by Black.  The White group is in danger of being cut off, and the lower left corner group is feeling a little worried.]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[fo]LB[ep:A]C[edgy: Now 'A' by Black is very severe and keeps White's groups apart.]

(;B[cp];W[ep];B[fq]LB[bm:C][fp:A][bq:B]C[edgy: I'm not sure about this move.  Maybe Black should just cut at A and fight it out, or push to B to settle his group in the corner  (with C as a later followup).]
;W[bq]LB[fp:A]C[What could I have done for the group of c4 to survive?

edgy: I think it's very hard for Black now.  I think cutting at 'A' is less promising now than before because the White corner is stronger, and it doesn't look like Black has enough room to live.]

(;B[do];W[bm];B[bn];W[dm];B[fp];W[dq];B[fm];W[gm]
(;B[em]C[edgy: This doesn't help.  Black might have tried to use the dead group to get some compensation on the lower side (see the variation).  Black is behind, but still has chances to catch up.]
;W[dn];B[co]C[edgy: Black's last move reduced his own liberties, so playing on the lower-side as  in the last set of variations is less effective, but Black should still have taken sente and played elsewhere.]
;W[gn];B[gl];W[hn];B[im];W[in];B[jm]TR[gm][fn][gn][hn][in][fo]
C[any tips in this situation. I was just rying to kill h6 to save my dead group

edgy: as I said in the last note, you should have taken sente elsewhere.  Black's last few moves have strengthened the marked stones;  now White can jump down and make a good position on the lower side.]
;W[hq]LB[jq:A]TR[fp][fq]C[edgy: The marked stones are probably dead.  Black should abandon tehm for later aji (for example, a move around 'A' later might threaten both to make a postion on the lower side, and to break the marked stones out.  Maybe what Black should do right now is to make a move on the upper side, try to sketch out a teritorial framework and see if he can tempt White into a hasty invasion.]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[gq];W[hr];B[hh]C[edgy: At first I thought this couldn't work,  but I can't find a clear way for White to come out ahead.  If you read this out beforehand, that's very good!]
;W[ig];B[ih];W[jh];B[hg];W[if];B[ji]
(;W[ii];B[jj];W[kh];B[hf]LB[ik:A]C[edgy: You did a really good job outplaying White in this fight, but here, it might have been better to play 'A' immediately and then make a move on the top or right side.  The push here actually strengthens White  and makes it harder for you to make territory on the top.]
;W[he];B[ik];W[ge];B[ie]LB[hc:A]C[edgy: I'm not sure about this cut now.  Maybe a move around 'A' to take some profit and threaten a cut later?]
;W[je]LB[kf:A]C[edgy: This strengthens Black. Making shape with 'A' was better, I think.]
;B[id];W[jd];B[ic];W[jc];B[gd]TR[ge][he][ef][gf][dg][eg][dh]
[fh][ei][fi]C[edgy: Good, taking profit in sente, since White has to worry about the marked group now.]
;W[gg]LB[nc:A][qn:B]TR[jc][jd][je][if][ig][jh][kh]C[Could I have killed the f12 group, and also, what kind of plan whould work better. i reffer to moyos and such

edgy:  I don't think you could have killed that group, since until now it could have jumped into the top side.
I think the game is fairly close now.  Since White has made some thickness at the top (the marked group) a move around 'A' might be a good idea.  An approach at 'B' (as you played) is also good.]
;B[qn];W[qp]LB[mq:B][qq:A]TR[hp][gq][hq][hr]C[edgy: The only problem with the approach is that it removes the invasion at 'A'.  Still, Black might be able to invade later around 'B' -- though this would be easier if the marked stones hadn't been played earlier.]
;B[kf]C[edgy: This might be premature.  If Black makes an extension from his corner stone at the top, it would make this more of a threat.]
;W[jf];B[lg]LB[nc:A][nd:B]TR[jf][kf]C[edgy: Here it would definitely have been better to leave the marked stones as a forcing exchange and play around 'A' or 'B'.  The move played doesn't really put pressure on White, so he gets to make a big move at the top.]
;W[nd]C[edgy: Makes some territory, stops Black from making territory,  and puts pressure on the corner.]
;B[ld]C[edgy: Trying to kill White here seems unreasonable, and the attempt makes White thicker.]
;W[lc];B[md];W[mc]C[Was there a better sequence. Trying to isolate the eyeless k14 group.]
;B[nc];W[ne];B[mf];W[oc];B[od];W[nb]C[edgy: Now Black will have a hard time making anything in the corner, beacause White gained thickness while beating off Black's attack..]
;B[pf];W[og];B[of];W[nf]C[edgy: I can't blame Black for trying to fight it out here, because there just isn't room anymore to make anough teritory to win the game  However, White has an advantage in the fight as well.]
;B[ng];W[nh];B[mg];W[oh];B[lh];W[qh]C[edgy: Now both the upper right corner and the right side group are under great pressure.]
;B[rg];W[rh];B[qg]C[I suddenly relized my group was in danger, as well as his. What could I have done?

edgy:  well, at this point I think if Black doesnt kill one of the White groups, he can't win, so fighting was the right thing to do.  But it is a hard fight for Black.]
;W[pg];B[qf]LB[pi:A]C[edgy: Probably Black should try 'A', since connecting gives White time to strengthen himself.]
;W[pj];B[qi];W[pi];B[qk];W[qc];B[rd];W[qd]
(;B[qe]LB[rc:A]C[edgy: I think Black could have lived with 'A' instead.  See variation.]
;W[rc];B[sd];W[oe];B[sc]LB[nj:A]TR[og][pg][nh][oh][qh][rh][pi]
[pj]C[edgy: Since Black's group here group here is dead, time to play elsewhere.  If Black plays 'A' he can try one last desperate fight against the marked group.  It's not likely to work, but it's the last thing to play for.]
;W[ol]C[edgy: Now White is clearly safe.];B[rb];W[qb];B[pb]

;W[sg]LB[ph:A]C[very bad ko
ANything better?

edgy:  No, afraid not.  White doesn't even have to win the ko;  he can always just connect at 'A'.]

C[I resigned after this move. I want to ask how to improve my reading abilities and strategy. Any tips? Thank you once again for your time and effort!!!!

edgy:  Your reading is not so bad, although it can always help to do a lot of life and death problems.  Much of tehegame was decided in complicated fighting which is very hard to read, and in some places you did well in it, like the sequence starting with G12.

What you need to do is to pick your fights better.  Always remember that in a contact fight, if you don't kill the group you are attacking, it will be come stronger.  Then it can turn around and attack you!  This happened in the lower left and the upper right, especially.

So, look for fights where not killing him won't damage your other positions so much. Also, look for opportunities to attack while making territory.

Two books I think would help you right now are _Attack and Defence_ from the Elementary Go series (read this first), and Takagawa's _Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go_.  Both of these will teach you more about how and where to fight.]
