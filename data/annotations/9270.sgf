C[Hi, reviewer
I'm 5k on KGS and is playing black in this game with sanrensei opening. My opponent is a very aggressive player. I always has a problem when playing with aggressive players and found their moves hard to deal with! Please help me clarify my mistakes.

Thanks :D



Hi Virtuoso,

This was an interesting game, with a few moements where I felt like you might have had better results with other ideas.  I'll try to explain them clearly for you.

(;B[pl]C[In the game, I was too afraid to play R7 because I think black response at Q8 will make it hard for my group to live. But I think I should have pincered.

H: After r7, q8 white can fight.  See the variation.  However, I'd rather tenuki at this point.  White has a weak group, so you should press it.]

Score estimation:

White territory: 30
White captures: 0

Black territory: 62
Black captures: 0

White score: 30.5
Black score: 62.0

Black wins by 31.5

H: Let's count the solid cash on the board presently:
A: 5 points
B: 7 points

H: Looking at weak groups, only white has a weak group at C.  Black's stone at D is obliterated.  Black's stones at E are small, so they might die.

I recommend learning to count and estimate your territory yourself, rather than relying on your game client.]

May be the game will be simpler if I play A?

H: Overall, you didn't play poorly.  You could definitely benefit from learning a bit more about direction of play and fighting.  I recommend:
Positional Judgement, Cho Chikun
Direction of Play, Kajiwara Takeo
Lots of tsumego books.  I particularly like the Get Strong series.]
