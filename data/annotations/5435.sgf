C[csh: I played this game when I visited the San Diego Go Club. I won, but I'm not sure that my strategy in the middlegame was sound. Particularly, when I started the invasion on the left, the game got really complicated and I didn't feel like I had a good grasp of the situation.

Please send any pointers that you can for both sides.

Thanks,

Chris Hayashida

;B[qf]TR[qk][rk][pl][gm][pm][gn][pn][qn][rn]LB[cr:A]C[csh: I wanted to make sure that the marked group was alive or had enough liberties. I was looking to pull out the marked cutting stones for another fight.

Further analysis showed that there was no attack that we could think of against the lower left. White can try to save his stones in gote, but then Black can play at 'A.'

* There is no need to worry about the marked white group on the right. It is clearly alive. However, S10 is a very valuable move for both sides. The two white stones in the middle are very light and disposable.]

(;W[hl]TR[nm][on][ko][mo][no]C[csh: I was looking to develop the cutting stone and just run it through the middle and connect to something. I figured this would have finished the game.

At the time, I thought that if I ran the group out, it would affect the corner group and the marked black group. When we analyzed the position after the game, it was apparent that attacking the corner group was gote, and White could not expect such profit.

What is a better move for White in this situation? Maybe endgame moves?]
