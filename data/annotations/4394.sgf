Dear reviewer, here is a KGS game which I resigned after a series of mistakes. I added some notes and questions, but feel free to comment on moves I just did not think of. Thank you in advance!]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dq];W[do];B[dc];W[cq]LB[fp:A]C[Any good suggestions how to continue after Black´s tenuki here? Better at A?]

(;B[dp]C[yip:
This is very bad - see comments on the next move...];W[cp]C[yip:
Black has basically forced white to hane at the head of the two stones here.  If you can imagine the joseki starting with white C3, D4, C4, the next move would be black D5 (so that white would be pushing from behind).]
;B[gp]C[yip:
Now the black stones are overconcentrated, but that can't really be helped because of D5.]
;W[eo];B[ce]C[Was it possible to make good shape in the lower left corner? As I had no idea, I made the shimari on the top instead...

yip:
Black needs to add a move here...]
(;W[dr]C[yip:
...but white lets black off easy.];B[op];W[oq]C[yip:
White should pincer here instead; the black stones would be separated into two weak groups along the bottom.]

(;B[pp];W[pq]C[yip:
Black has the same bad shape here.];B[qo];W[np];B[qq];W[rp]

(;B[ro];W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[nq];W[pr];B[no];W[mp];B[mo]
(;W[mq];B[qj]C[On the other hand, I thought I made a nice position on the right here...]
;W[jc]
(;B[hc];W[nc];B[lc]
(;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me];W[rc]C[yip:
White's play has been inconsistent here?  Why bother with K17?]

(;B[cj]LB[rd:A]C[Better close off the territory on the right at A?

yip:
That's probably what I'd end up doing.  The right side is huge, and black now stands a good chance of getting a lot of territory along the top (N18 to prevent a connection, then H15, for example).]
;W[pk]
(;B[pn]C[yip:
Black is very cautious here];W[pj]C[yip:
White's making a heavy group in black's area of influence...jumping out lightly is a much better idea.]

(;B[qi];W[db]C[yip:
White can't tenuki in this position...he has a group of stones just asking to be attacked.]

(;B[cb]C[yip:
Similarly, black should close out the right side; it's huge, compared with the possibility of white running out.  All white is doing at this point is creating weak groups...]
;W[ch]C[yip:
...and white creates still more weak groups to aim at.];B[ej]
;W[eh]
(;B[ef]C[yip:
This move doesn't do much; black needs to be a little careful, since white is still strong in the lower left.

Because black's strong in the upper right, it makes sense to drive white that way.]
;W[gh];B[cn];W[gf];B[fg];W[fh];B[gg];W[hg];B[hf];W[if];B[he]
;W[ih]
(;B[jj]LB[nj:A]C[Perhaps less ambitious at A?

yip:
Peeping first seems good...];W[ie]
(;B[hd];W[lj];B[jq]TR[lj][pj][pk]C[As I was not sure if the marked stones could be cut off, I tried to surround them on a large scale...

yip:
K3 doesn't surround the white stones, though; white can play L4 to cut off that stone.  Besides which, if white wants to escape, it'll have to be towards the top.

Black needs to be a little careful of the left side, since those stones aren't very strong.  A better approach might be to play at L12, which would somewhat help the weak group, and help cut off the white stones.]
;W[gk]C[yip:
This weakens the left side and K10.];B[lp];W[lo];B[lq];W[mr]
;B[ln];W[ko];B[kn];W[jo];B[lr];W[nr];B[ki];W[kk];B[jk];W[kl]

(;B[io]LB[jl:B][jn:A]C[What about A (or B) here... I was afraid for the life of my bottom group..?

yip:
This forces white to connect the weak groups, while at the same time moving towards the stronger group in the center.  Black should try to keep white separated from the strong group.]
;W[jn];B[ml];W[jm];B[fq]
(;W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[dm];W[nj];B[oh]C[yip:
This move doesn't do anything for black, since the side is open.  White has to connect around H7, or try to cut off the K10 stones.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[ec];B[dd];W[ca];B[bb];W[hb]
(;B[gb];W[ib];B[li]LB[fb:A]C[I did not realize until later, that White could connect at A...:-(]
;W[mi]
(;B[mh];W[nh];B[ng];W[ni];B[lg];W[re]C[What now? How can Black save as much territory as possible?

yip:
The territory there is negligible if black defends at this point, so it's best to play something more urgent.  The black group around Q6 isn't all that strong, for example (since white can play at N6), so defending somewhere around there may be good.  B5 is also large, as is settling the top side.]

;B[jg];W[jf]
(;B[ii];W[jh];B[kh];W[kg]C[yip:
Overall, it looks like black was winning for most of the game.  White played far too aggressively, and left several weak groups around the board.  Look back around move 64, for example:  black has more territory, good influence, and lots of potential.  Unfortunately, black spent most of the time following white, rather than seeking out the big points on the board.

Keep in mind that in attacking, you may not be able to kill, but in the process you form walls that can be used to make territory in other parts of the board.  Try to visualize where your stones are going, and how they'll work together.  Try to control the direction of play to maximize that potential - in this game, black missed a few chances to take that control.

In the end, it seems to have come down to white trying lots of random moves, hoping for a mistake.  You've already identified a few key errors in reading, and together they'd probably have been enough for black to win.]
