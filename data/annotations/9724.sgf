AB[dd][dp][pd][pp]C[Thank you very much for reviewing my game!!

georg: you are welcome. you did a nice game. there are two things you may consider thinking about.
1. if you give your opponent big spheres of influence in the beginning (as in a 4 stone handicap game), you need to invade aggressively. you emphasized calm and defensive play in this game, though you were behind most of the time.
2. you have a good sense for spotting big points - but consider playing big points after having played necessary moves (e.g. move 9/22 and 65). This might look small, but gives you strong bases to carry out your attacks.]
PL[W]
(;W[nq]C[I'm never quite sure what to do in handicap games, and not even really al
ways sure what the best thing to do vs. 4-4 stones - is this reasonable?

georg: this absolutely OK and the most common play. you can choose almost any 
other approach move as well. not approaching results in difficult positions, e
ven if black plays very calm - see variation];B[np];W[mp]C[Not sure if this is the right response, I know when someone attaches you 
usually want to hane, so I did that.

georg: looks good to me];B[oq]
(;W[mq]LB[no:a]C[georg: here you lost momentum. consider the play at a]
;B[or];W[iq]C[I thought that playing on the 2nd line at this stage would be too small
, and also thought the 3 space extension was okay...

georg: see variation of move 5];B[gq];W[cj]LB[no:a]C[Just trying to take a big point here.

georg: OK, but approaching is easier. see variations move 1. consider in this position the firm play at a.]
;B[cm];W[cg];B[ce];W[jc]C[Again, just trying to take a big point.

georg: this move gave black influence in all corners. this is not good and req
uires you to invade aggressively.];B[nc];W[qj]C[Here I thought I needed to take this point before he did - being a good
 extension from his shimari.

georg: its OK but mind black's influence.];B[qg];W[qm];B[qn]
;W[pm]C[Standing up is the right move here, right?

georg: OK.];B[gc]C[This move makes me think I should have played at J17 instead of K17...

georg: not necessarily - see variation.]
(;W[je]C[Not being able to do a 3 space extension I ran out into the middle.]
;B[nn]LB[no:a]C[georg: d0 you get why playing at a earlier would have been good?]
;W[nl]C[Didn't want to get trapped in here, so I'm trying to run out to the mid
dle.];B[ln];W[ll]C[Not sure if I should have followed him out here - it's not like I'm put
ting pressure on him since those stones in the corner are pretty settled.]
;B[jm];W[jk]C[But now I figured this gives my pair of stones on the top something to 
un towards?

georg: reasonable plan.];B[el];W[ej]C[Okay, now I'm seeing the possibility of building a wall along the 7 to 
10 ish line, and thinking I might be able to turn that into some territory by 
unning my top stones iehter right or left - probably left.]
;B[gj]
(;W[ii]C[Would F9 have been better?

georg: yes. you need to cut black to invade the big moyo in the lower left - see variation.]
;B[gh];W[gf]C[I think this move was primarily to leave the threat of F9 as a possibil
ity.];B[ef];W[fg]C[Okay, this time I did cut the diagonal...]
;B[eg];W[fh];B[fi]
(;W[eh]C[I'm now thinking E11 would have been better here?]
;B[hf];W[he];B[hg]
(;W[ge]LB[fd:A]C[Just trying to stay connected at this point.

georg: play at a to stay connected and invade at the same time.]
;B[id]
(;W[ie]C[Hmm. Maybe K16 instead?

georg: No, black would cut.];B[jd];W[kd];B[hd];W[fk]C[Now I see why I didn't do K16 - I was aiming at this.]
;B[gk];W[fl];B[em];W[gm];B[gl]
(;W[hm]C[I'm guessing now that this move was bad. J8 instead?

georg: No, black would cut - see variation.];B[il];W[hl];B[ik]
;W[hk]C[Now I'm just desperately trying to keep him separated.]
;B[ij];W[hj];B[hi]
(;W[ji]LB[jg:A]C[georg: this was bad. play at a leaves no chance for black - see variation]
;B[jg];W[ko]LB[jj:A]C[I'm guessing this was not the time for this move...

georg: no, play at a is firm and correct.];B[jj];W[kj]C[L11 instead? Or is it already too late here?]
;B[ki];W[li]C[Should I have haned from the other side? Or was it already too late?]
;B[kh];W[lk];B[lh];W[jl];B[im];W[kn];B[km];W[lm];B[kl];W[kk]
;B[in];W[ho]C[At this point I'm still flailing around trying to capture this group - 
 or at least keep it enough of a possibilty that I can get something in compen
saition for not being able to do so. I can see now that there was no chance.]
;B[io];W[ip];B[hp];W[hn];B[ih];W[fm];B[fo];W[nh];B[pi];W[gg]
;B[pj];W[if]C[I think I'm still just flailing trying to get enough liberties off of h
im so that I can prevent him from connecting some of that stuff up. This is no
t my usual style...];B[ol];W[om];B[nm];W[lf]C[Again, that ugly shape...]
;B[mg]C[And the punishment due.];W[mh];B[lg]
(;W[mf]C[I'm guessing that here I needed to be playing on the other side of this
 group (somewhere around P9 or so) to try to get two eyes for that group in th
e middle. I'm not sure why I thought this was a good move. At this point I thi
nk I was pretty shaken - something to work on as well.

georg: see variation.];B[ng];W[ph];B[qh];W[of]C[Again, thinking now that there was a move on the inside that would have
 secured life, or at least given me a shot at it.

georg: see variation.];B[og];W[pg];B[oh];W[pf];B[ni];W[mi];B[ok]
;W[nj];B[oi];W[qi];B[qk];W[rk];B[qf];W[rl];B[nf];W[mm];B[mn]
;W[nk];B[mj];W[cq]C[I never know when to invade at 3-3. This seemed as good a time as any..
.];B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fr]C[Now I'm seeing that the typical 3-3 invasion joseki doesn't work becaus
e of the stone at F3. What's the right play here? Block at D2 and allow the ha
ne at B3? Something else? Something different earlier? Or not to even invade i
n the first place?

georg: see vatiation.];W[bp]
(;B[bo];W[ep];B[fq]C[I can see that allowing this did me some harm a few moves later.]
;W[eo]C[Another extra move on the outside that he ignored (wisely, right?).]
;B[bq];W[br];B[ap];W[cr]C[Here I'm seeing a living shape, but I'm a move or two short of making i
t. Those couple of moves outside may have been the difference here...]
;B[es];W[ds];B[fs]
(;W[fp];B[dr];W[gp]C[So there's a little bit of compensation, but seems like I could have li
ved in the corner and that would have been better.];B[cs]C[I suppose before this move maybe I could have started a ko and lived? I
'd have to have won the ko, and played at B1, and played at A2, though, right?
 That means it wasn't possible after all?

georg: at this point you cannot win the corner.];W[hq];B[ar]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[en];B[cl];W[ek];B[dh];W[ei];B[gi];W[dg];B[ch]
;W[bh];B[lp];W[no]C[Now I'm trying to live with the stuff around L3...]
;B[oo];W[op];B[on];W[po]C[Now I'm seeing an opportunity to start a capturing race and ko for blac
k's stones around O6.];B[pn];W[qo];B[qp];W[ro]C[Trying to stack up enough liberties to win a capturing race...]
;B[rn];W[rp];B[rq];W[qq];B[pq];W[sn]C[I'm really not sure why I thought this was good.]
;B[sm];W[lo]C[So now I figured I'd at least use that shortage of liberties to complet
e my wall.];B[kp];W[mo];B[is]C[And here he lost track of liberties...]
;W[rm];B[lj]C[Aaron Morris (mokshus): Whoops,  didn't see it in Atari]

ory.];B[fc];W[ed];B[ec];W[cd]C[Here I'm figuring if he ataris, I can come around and take two stones. 
If he connects, maybe I can connect under.];B[cc];W[de];B[bd]
