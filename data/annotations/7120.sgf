C[Hi review I played black in this game and I thought I did ok in the beginning but make bad mistake in middle and late games

HI TEDDY
acording to my feeling, the key problem of this game is livan and death. Second most importand is shape. Both players seem to miss the right shapes rather often.
[see sumary at the end of the game\]

Sorry that my english is not too good.];B[qd];W[dd];B[oq];W[dp]
;B[oc];W[pp]C[Bad move: 
an attachment or a shoulder hit are emergency measures. Without an emergency it is better to stay farer away from enemy stones.]
;B[pq]C[good answer.

Black stones have 5 libertys, white has only 3, so white has a big disadvantage in the comeing fight.]

[gs][hs][is][ks]C[In the end black lost with 11.5 points.

the beginning starts with shape problems - 
 in the lower left both players insist on adding stones to secure / attack a save group.

the atack on m17 is a bad idea - 
 1) just continue the fuseki.
 2) neve atach on a stone you want to atack.

In the middle game you do well. white drives you into his own moyo.
you get two weak targets.

Your biggest problem seems to be live and death - practice live and death and you will win games like this. Maybe this practice will even improove you yose. You lost 5 Points in the lower right as a result of a live and death problem - This is almost half of you final loosing margin.

So live and death is what you need to look at.
