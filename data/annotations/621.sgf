;W[cd];B[pq];W[nc];B[pf];W[ic];B[qj]C[: I prefer Q9 or R9 because better pincer with Q3, but R9 is also a big move (but it's matter of taste)]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[dk];B[co]C[: it's not an urgent move, maybe to early]
;W[dn];B[jq];W[qo];B[qp];W[po];B[np];W[ql];B[oj];W[ol]C[MK: Up to this point, I thought the game went on quite normal. Now I made an invasion in the upper left corner and from that point, my opponent dominated the whole game and in the end, I had nearly no trritory nor influence and he had everything. But still I don't know, what went wrong.]
;B[ec]C[MK: Probably a wrong point?   : E17 is a bit deep, E16 seems to be more safe and closer to the wide area on the left side]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[df];B[gd]C[: black is too heavy];W[he]C[MK: Very severe. If there is nothing better what I can do than jumping out, then there must have been some big mistakes earlier.]
;B[ff];W[dh];B[fh]C[: yes, it's important to go in the centre, later black can invade the large white north group ?]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd]C[: In my opinion it's better to block on the other side and then attack the white group]
;W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[jo]C[MK: With this move, I wanted to secure territory at least on one side. But only 30 moves later, there were no black territory at all...]
;W[cq];B[bo]C[: Here you can't keep the corner, so it's better to play D3]
;W[eq];B[ep];W[fq];B[dq];W[dr];B[gq];W[gr];B[hr]C[: I prefer C2]
;W[fr];B[hq];W[go]C[MK: Can he really live there in sente?]
;B[gp];W[kp]C[: Is White pooling black legs ?];B[jp]C[: too submissive, maybe L4 or N6 : balck must attack not defend]
;W[oq];B[op];W[pp];B[qq];W[nq];B[mq];W[mr];B[lq];W[lr];B[kq]
;W[pr];B[qr];W[or];B[ps]C[: Does O1 work for black ?];W[ns]
;B[qs];W[os];B[ro];W[rn];B[sp];W[no];B[mo];W[oo];B[mp];W[sn]
;B[sr];W[rk];B[rj];W[ne];B[ce]C[MK: If I want to win, I must play very hard now. But again, I achieved nearly nothing.]

C[: D10 seems better];W[di];B[bm];W[cj];B[bk];W[cl];B[bl];W[gg]

;B[gl];W[fm];B[hm];W[li];B[hd]C[MK: My last try to do something.]
;W[id];B[ie];W[hf];B[je];W[kd];B[md];W[nd];B[ke];W[ld];B[ih]

;W[hn];B[jm];W[jf];B[gn];W[gm]C[MK: That seemed to me a good point to resign... It can happen, that one lose a big group or something. But I can't remember, when I was outplayed in such a way over the whole game from an only two stones stronger player.   : It seems that black does'nt try any attack but too late

: Black must watch white's thinness and try to use it to attack

: in this game, black played to submissive])
