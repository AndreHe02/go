So , this is the first game , I am sending to gtl , I hope I make everything right :)
You should know , that I am not a 4d on KGS , I am just around 7k , but through wierd circumstances , I got that strong :)

*Hi 
This is my 4th review I guess :)
I will try to clarify your questions and spot if I notice any mistakes.

Btw I am 2k KGS  (current account: ijuset ) but have not played for a while. Maybe my strength decreased a bit. But anyway, let's start ! :D]

[os]C[So , this game was finished .
I have to mention , that he wanted no handicap , I think 4 stones would have been good .

Questions I had during this game :
How could I make the thing around B3 better , could I have killed that group ?
How should I have invaded around O2 ?
Are there some very big , very wrong moves i played ?


So , I hope there is someone , who can help me getting better :)

Thank you ;)
TL3

*Yes you won the game pretty easily. 
Remember it is always better to have the games which you have lost or won hardly review. But still I guess this is first time you post a game :). 

You played B3 variations pretty good, except extending further with B2, black is live there.

B was pretty strong at the right bottom of the board  Q2 Q3 J 2 J3 stones were backing up for any invasion from the second line. In those stiations, you should think minimizing the profit of the opponent in sente instead of killing or invading the whole thing. If you do so, he will still live but with a more solid shape.

I hope I could give one or two good tips to you.
Keep posting your games to GTL and also review other weaker players' game. Go is more fun that way. Cyu ! :)
