C[I'm stlWill playing as black in this game. Thanks in advance for the review.

My game fell completely fell apart! In the last game I played, my opponent one due to very strong thickness towards the center, which I tried to emulate this game. Unfortunately, I kept giving up corner territory in exchange for it. Bad, stlWill! Bad! By the end of it, I had no corners!]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[qn];B[qo]TR[pk][ql][po][qp]C[This is a little unusual, the triangles are more normal.]
;W[ro];B[qp];W[qk];B[dp];W[gp];B[cn]TR[dn]C[Same here, feel free to play a little higher.  Don't worry about being confused in these situations, your opponent is making some unusual approaches so as long as you're thinking out your response you're fine.]

;W[bc];B[be];W[dq];B[eq]TR[ch][ck][gp]C[Here you have clearly sacrificed territory for influence.  Never do this blindly, but instead consider your surroundings.  If you build the influence now, it means you plan on using it on something specific later.  The marked stones are good examples of this.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[cr];B[dr];W[cq];B[er];W[co];B[cm];W[fk]C[I think white is jumping out too soon, I would put some serious thought into trying to kill white in the bottom left, I don't know for sure, but I've tried a few variations and I think you can kill him.

However, before that you'll need to secure the cut at D6 as you do later.]
;B[en];W[nq]
(;B[lq]C[Here's you're surrounding white from the left side, because you're afraid that if you play too passively on the bottom, white will secure himself, wasting your influence.  However, I think you're underestimating your options on th eleft side, see the variation.]
;W[jq];B[lo];W[no]C[I should've seen this as an attack on the corner. Instead, I was too busy attacking white.]
;B[mp];W[np]C[This exchange only strengthens white, be more agressive at challenging him on the right (you still have a chance), or start pressuring the left.]

;W[gc];B[nd]SQ[nc][pf]C[I don't like this approach, it's too close to white, giving him some room to fight you directly.  Go with o17 instead, or simply expand along the right side.  Vaguelly trap him by limiting his options, don't worry about a direct fight yet.]
;W[nc];B[ne]SQ[oc]C[Too passive, you need to secure the corner here to limit whites ability to create life, adn thus force him to run.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mb];B[lc];W[mc];B[ld]C[A wasted move, I think. Would've been better spend on the right side.

Agreed, if you expand on the right side its huge!  You both secure some territory on the right, and build up some territory in the middle.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qi];W[me];B[mf]SQ[qe]C[That's too risky to play here, you didn't clog up the cut at R15, so you can't give him another potential cut nearby, or else he'll catch your stones in a net.]

;W[sh];B[qh];W[rj];B[pj];W[nk];B[nm]C[A good idea, but it won't cut it.  All I can suggest is to read ahead more to know when you can't be this greedy.  Instead settle with a move like o11.]

Don't worry, we all make that mistake.  Its just a skill you have to learn.  Take some itme in the game to sit back, and look at the big picture.  This is not only important because you don't want to get cut off in situations like this, but also because you want to be taking the initiative in the game.  Don't just defend, get creative!]

[jk][el][bm][dm][dn][fn][gn][eo][fo][go][gp][fq][fr]C[I think you did decently.  You were trying out a new strategy, and you were actually able to make territory in ways you've probably never experienced before.  If you hadn't got cut off on the bottom right, the game wouldn't be that far off.

Let me give you some more general advice.  I'm not sure if better players will back me on this or not, but when I use my influence I use it to chase my opponent.  I want to make him desperate to create life somewhere, and while I keep making things more and more difficult I subtly create some territory for myself.  Keep that in mind when you're trying to use your influence, attack like you're trying to kill your opponent, but be okay with the result if you don't.

Also, I recommended practices keeping the initiative more.  I felt like white was pushing you around a lot, which gives him an advantage.  Try and assess the value of each move you and your opponent do, and see if there's something bigger on the board that you can play that'll force your opponent to respond to you.  This is a tough skill, its one I'm working on a lot myself, but I'm sure you'll get it down.

Well, I hope my comments were useful.  Email me back if you have any questions, I check my email every week or so so I'll try and get back to you asap if needed.]
