C[I played black in this game. During the game I  feel my playing level
varied greatly. I would make good moves and then a few very terrible moves.
 At times I would be counting and have in mind a sequence
of play, but then I would get focused on some other line of play, one that
resulted in smaller results. (For example when I let that very large
group of white stones live) Often  I  played moves impulsively.
Then I would get in a jam and start thinking again. The final result was I
resigned with the feeling  I could of won.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]

(;B[po]C[Should I of moved at R17  instead of enclosing the bottom right?
MK: Yes, enclosing top corner is more important. If white Plays Q5, you have good continuatin.]
;W[mq];B[lp]C[I wanted to reduce and build a wall facing my side framework.
MK: I would prefer to play somewhere around C 10. This move could be done a little bit later. This move helps white to make a good position.]
