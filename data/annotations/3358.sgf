C[I was playing white here. Although I've won, I was unsure about this till the last move.
Please help me to find where I can play stronger. Thank you.

[DP\]  OK, going through the entire game, here are the main things for you to concentrate on which came up.
1) counting.  you can do this when your opponent is thinking.  vital that you know if you're winning or losing, so that you can adjust your strategy accordingly.  Doesn't have to be accurate, but will help your judgement
2) contact plays.  use them for defence, when you're under attack and need to make shape.  when you're attacking, try not to use them, but rather leave a little distance which will result in you having a better position on the outside of your opponents group.
3) watch those cutting points! the stone on L16 was critical in the middle game
4) when you missread (we all do), STOP.  Think, and play somewhere else.  Don't dig a deeper hole!
5) you don't have to kill your opponents groups to win the game.  just keep them under pressure.]

(;B[bb]C[[DP\] This B move is slack - it should be at F15.  The reason it is slack is because it is small - B should concentrate on keeping W separate and building up strength to attack one of the W groups. See variations]
;W[df]C[Is that move OK? How about K17 or C13?
[DP\] D13 or J16 are joseki moves, as in the earlier variations.  However there is nothing really wrong with your move here - it's just maybe a little too close.]
;B[ac];W[jc]C[[DP\] Good - ignoring B's small move];B[bd]
(;W[od]C[Can I play here? Or better C11 first?
[DP\] A move on the left would be better, since the top group is stable and not under threat.  But which move?  If you're happy sacrificing C16, then it might go as the variation]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc]
(;W[nd]C[[DP\] Given you already have K17 and G17 in place, you could be a bit more adventurous here with O14 perhaps?]
;B[qf];W[qo]C[[DP\] This would again have been a nice time for a play around C9]

(;B[qp]C[[DP\] B would probably have been better off with a pincer move here, to use the strength he has top right with R14]
;W[po];B[np];W[qk];B[qi];W[kq]
(;B[do]C[[DP\] Good move from B to ignore your L3, but if he had played at C9 it would have hurt you!]
;W[co]C[Or better C7, C8 or C9?
[DP\] C9, as per variation on move 15];B[dp];W[cp];B[eq]C[[DP\] The avalanche (nadare) joseki has a lot of variations and trickery!...]
;W[dn];B[cq];W[dr];B[er]C[[DP\] ...and there is not much room for mistakes.  This B move should be at B3, threatening either E2 or C6 next.  It is pretty much the key move, so now you can take advantage]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[cn]
(;W[bp]C[[DP\] Consider how much more you can achieve if you play C7 first, as per the variation]

(;B[bn]C[[DP\] That was a bit too nice from B.  E6 would have been better]
;W[en];B[fo]
(;W[hq]C[How to play here? Is D9 better?
[DP\] You need to stop B extending from B6 and getting a base for those stones.  His ideal spot would be around C10, so that's your ideal spot too.  He dies painfully :-) see variations]
;B[ck];W[ci];B[cg];W[dg];B[bf];W[cf];B[bg]
(;W[ae]C[[DP\] I would prefer E11 here to attack instead];B[bi]
;W[bj]
(;B[ch]C[[DP\] B could have gone for a ko with C10];W[cj];B[dh]

(;W[dk]C[[DP\] Try not to use contact moves when attacking.  They're better for defence, since they help you *and your opponent* make shape.  Note how your E6 stones get extremely weak as a result of this exchange.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[cm];W[bl];B[dm]
(;W[ek];B[fm]C[[DP\] Oh dear E6 stones dead!];W[eh];B[ei];W[di]
;B[eg];W[fh]C[Are previous ten moves OK?
[DP\] see comments on individual moves
Can I take C13 now?
[DP\] a close run thing.  there may be a ko]
(;B[ef];W[ee];B[de];W[ce];B[fe];W[af];B[dd];W[ag];B[lc]
(;W[ld]C[How about this and the next one moves?
[DP\] Again, it's a contact move.  You're the one who is strong here, so you should be attacking with a bit more distance]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[md];W[le];B[mc];W[me];B[nb]C[[DP\] The end result of the contact play is that B has extended and secured a big corner, and has a *hugely* powerful cutting stone in place at L16.  You should capture this immediately.]
;W[nr]C[[DP\] Nothing is as important as capturing L16 to keep your stones connected]

(;B[lr]C[[DP\] But luckily for you B hasn't seen it];W[lq];B[mr]
;W[mq];B[nq];W[or];B[pr];W[kr];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp]
(;W[nk]C[How to play here? May be P14 or H14?
[DP\] K15 :-)   P14 will defend the O15 cut, true, but H14 is not strong enough against B moving out with K15.]
;B[ne];W[fp]C[I've missread here
[DP\] We all do at some point.  The hard thing to learn is that, as soon as you realise you have misread - stop!  Play somewhere else.]
;B[ep];W[fn];B[gn]C[[DP\] I suspect you already knew it wasn't working now, didn't you?  But very hard to stop!]
;W[go];B[em];W[hf];B[id]C[[DP\] Right area from B, wrong move.  K15 is what hurts W here, particularly with O15 now in place.]
;W[gd]C[Where I've lose M15 group?
[DP\] Earlier than you might think.  It isn't in the future from here, it's in the past.  L16 needed capturing back at move 90.]
;B[ic];W[kb];B[oe];W[ib];B[jd];W[mg];B[hb];W[hc];B[ia];W[jb]
;B[jf]
(;W[ih];B[jh];W[ji]C[[DP\] Contact moves again.  B builds up shape and strength and finally kills M15 group.  Play from the other side instead.  See variation a few moves back]
;B[kh]
(;W[ki]C[[DP\] The contact moves are strengthening B and pushing him to attack your weak group. N11 would have been better here]
;B[lh];W[nh];B[li];W[kk];B[ni];W[oi];B[nj];W[oj];B[oh]C[[DP\] and B finally kills M15 stones]
;W[mi];B[mj];W[lj]C[I've missread here.
Is M15 lost?
[DP\] Yes.  The cut at P12 killed it, but it was already critically wounded from L16 and O15 earlier!]
;B[mh];W[ng]C[[DP\] Again, you know it's dead.  Stop, play somewhere else.  You can always use this for ko threats later.]
;B[og];W[mk];B[mi];W[lg]C[J13?
[DP\] yes, would be much better.  stops playing with dead stones, and helps the under siege H17 set]
;B[kf];W[if];B[mf];W[lf]C[[DP\] OK, we're 150 moves in, nothing much is going on (leave those dead stones alone!), so do you know what the score is?  You should do, at this stage in a game, to adjust your strategy.  Do it very approximately - be nice to your opponent and tough on yourself.  To the nearest 5 points each area
B: top left 10, top right 65 (huge!), bottom right 10, lower left centre 5: total 90
W: left side 20, lower left 10, bottom 10, komi 5: total 45
This means you're currently in big trouble and need to attack.  You have a lot of stones in the centre and so should be able to get something there.]
;B[nf];W[hl];B[fk];W[fj]C[G7?
[DP\] No, don't play up against thickness.  G7 would provoke H6 and put your bottom group under more pressure]
;B[gk];W[hn]C[[DP\] Good - makes shape for your lower stones.  But you are playing up against a very strong B position so you must defend the cutting points you leave with something like G4]
;B[eo]
(;W[ln];B[oq];W[ls];B[ok]C[[DP\] S10 a nicer move to secure the top right corner]
;W[pj];B[qn];W[qm];B[pn];W[on];B[pk];W[qj];B[rr];W[ph];B[pg]
;W[qh];B[ho];W[qg]C[[DP\] Good work by W to reduce B corner by about 20 points]
;B[pf];W[gp];B[hm];W[in];B[im];W[il]C[K7?
[DP\] Yep.];B[jn];W[io];B[jo];W[ip];B[jl]C[[DP\] oh-oh, B is ripping into the W centre]
;W[jk];B[ik];W[hk];B[gi];W[gj];B[fi];W[gh];B[hj];W[ij];B[ej]
C[[DP\] nice work by B to reduce W's potential centre];W[ik]
C[useless move, but I try to play some trick next
[DP\] not a useless move at all.  it is absolute sente and B must play G7 immediately]
;B[ll];W[gl]C[[DP\] good work.  won you the game.];B[fl];W[gm]
C[[DP\] OK, we're 200 moves in. Score?
B: top left 10, top right 50, bottom right 10, lower left centre 5, prisoners 10: total 85
W: left side 20, lower left 10, bottom 15, right side 25, komi 5: total 75
things are closer now.  your attacking has been going well.  look for the big endgame moves]
