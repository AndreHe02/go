C[>Hello, this game is played on the Korean dashn.com server.
>Although I (white) managed to win this game, I have some opening and middle game questions. Of course, if you have >other comments, I am glad to hear them!

You are quite strong, so my comments can only be taken as suggestions, as I'm only 4 dan amateur in europe. I hope they inspire you to think more about the choices you made in the game and how you could make moves that are even better then what I suggest...]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[de];W[pp];B[cc]C[This move is slow. If you play the 5-4 point it's not with the intent of making an early enclosure but to make influence by pressing down if your opponent plays in the corner. If you want to make an enclosure quickly you play 3-4 or 5-3.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of]LB[qc:a]C[I was not really sure here which joseki to chose.
Maybe 'a' (R17) is a better choice (see var).  What do you think?]

(;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[rg];B[qc];W[rd]C[This variation has the feeling of trying to settle the corner quickly -- It feels a bit strange to make B thick here...]
;B[jd];W[og]C[>Is this move big and important?

I think so. If you would have answered P13 at Q12, it's good to go here first.]
;B[mf];W[jp]LB[cj:a]C[>Maybe a move around 'a' (C10) is better? I am not sure about this.

Me neither. It looks like a different game.];B[cn];W[dk]C[>What do you think of this move?

The only sensible thing to do, considering you played at K4]

I don't know which move is best to try to close off the area -- I think you'd be better off invading at K17 first and see how it develops before chosing how to play in the center.]
