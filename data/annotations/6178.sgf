C[Faplo: I am about 8 kyu KGS. opening is mistery for me no idea how to play on it and i think i made most of my mistakes in opening i pointed some places where i luck understanding. but probably there are much more.

b: I do not think you should worry to much about opening yet. You can become 1 dan without learning much more about opening. The Asian player say "Europeans study to much openings. As soon as the fighting beginns they loose because they didnt study Tsume Go (Problem Go) enough." Also Professionals say about the opening sometime things like: "It is clearly better to extend here instead of playing the pincer". When asked back how many points the pincer is worse then the extension, they answer "Maybe 2 points". So please do not worry to much. As you asked questions about the opening I am answering them as good as I can, even if I think my answer is not important.. For that reason I put those comments in (parantesis). I advise you to rather read the other comments more carefully. The one I find particularily important for your play (i.e. were I think you can improve most) I put stars * in front.  Just to put it into a nut shell: You have to learn to fight before you can go to the fine points of opening theory.]

(;B[mq]C[F: Is this move possible in this postion or too slow?
(b:) Joseki moves are O4 or e.g R7.
O4 is not only better then your N3 because it is Joseki, but also because it gives a good high low bilance. I put the main Joseki line into the variation.]
;W[qk]LB[pm:B][qm:A][qo:C]C[I thinked about A, B or C but couldn't decide if possible

(b): C looks good to me, A is the right invasion point and is of course "possible" in the sense that the invasion stone will do some damage to white. In the course of the fight white will get some compensation and the judgement if the invasion is good from the point of view of a professional  does not really help you, as the real outcome will depend much more on your fighting abilities. B is the wrong point.]

(;B[cn]C[F: I never know what to do with this position leave it or pincer or san san

b. Very good! The pincer is best. But please be aware: You will of course not be able to kill white. The typical outcome will be: white lives small in the corner and gets access to te center. Black takes up positions on both sides. You should be happy with such a result and not ask for more.]
;W[fp]
(;B[eq]LB[cq:A][dq:B]C[F: I Think something very wrong with this move maybe A or B or something else

b: you are right: very wrong move. you have to take up position on the side and not crawl into the corner! Even if you do not know the continuation, G4 will always give you a better result. It is the right direction.]
;W[ep]LB[gp:A][gq:B]C[*b*: This is a very important situation: Look at the two rows of stones touching each other. Whoever moves first to the right will locally have the far better end. So you should play G4 imediately. White should play G3 if black lets him. A whole chapter called " The stones go walking" in the book "Fundamentals of Go" is devoted exactly to this important point. You should play G4 without thinking.]

(;B[cr]C[b: This seems to be driven by te desire to steal the basis of white. You cannot hope for such a result. You must not begrudge white his basis. Go is about balance. You leave something for black and take your fair share.]
;W[gq]C[b: good by white! He read the chapter "the stones go walking"]
;B[gr];W[hq];B[hr];W[cq]C[b: white didnt read the chapter in the book. Otherwise he would continue with J2 forcing you in a very low position.]
;B[dq];W[cp]C[b: white B2 would be painful for black];B[ck]
LB[pd:1]C[F: seems like i am too low ? only 1 stone on 4th line but what else can i do oO is it ok?

b: J3 would be best. It is the most important point. Otherwise C9 is fine.]
;W[ch];B[en]C[F: i wanted to neutralize wall
b: The wall is already neutralized.];W[br]LB[gn:A]C[F : a?
b: white is looking for a base now.];B[dr];W[bo];B[bn];W[bs]

(;B[iq]C[b: good move!];W[fm];B[fn];W[gn];B[go];W[fo];B[gp]
C[b: good!];W[ao]
(;B[an]C[*b*: This is an endgame move. You must try to avoid such moves before the endgame starts. Right now there are many moves on the board which bring you ten points or more. If you make such a small endgame move you are givn√≠ng away these ten points.
Making an endgame move in the opening is aproximately like throwing away a handicap stone. One could say: After this move you are playing against one (more) handicap stone.]
;W[qf];B[hp]C[*b*: you can see this now: you exchanged the small move A6 against the huge white move R14. The position would be much better for you if both stones (A6 and R14) would be missing. Stated otherwise: Had you played H4 at move 37, you would never have answered white R14 at A6! But this is exactly what you did. 
Do not get me wrong: Your move H4 is good in this position.]
;W[nc];B[qc]LB[oe:B][pf:A]C[b: you should move out here. With P15 or Q14.]
;W[oe]C[F: is black already alive?
b: yes, black is alive. This is still no nice position for black as nearly every move on the outside of white is forhand against the corner.]
;B[pe]C[(b:) This is not good. It is fixing the shape. It helps white more then black.]
;W[pf];B[qe]LB[re:A]C[b: bad shape. Avoid the empty triangle. Jumping to S15 would be better (if you feel you must do something for your corner)]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[oc];B[pc];W[cd]C[F: White seemed to be better position than me at this mmoment so I wanted to reduce upper side somehow]
;B[jc]LB[ee:A]C[b: It is hard to find a good invasion point. This one is not so good as you cannot extend to the right. I think I would try E15 (making miai of F17 and C15)]
;W[hc]C[b: correct. black finds no suitable extension];B[lc]
C[b: painful for black];W[kb]C[b: white is helping black now. As black cannot build a base anyway, black needs to go towards the center. That becomes easier after whites moves.]
;B[kc];W[lb];B[mc];W[mb];B[mf];W[nf];B[me];W[ne]LB[mg:A][lh:B]
C[*b*. This is again "the stones go walking". Same theme as at moves 12 and 29. you have to continue to move toward the center, otherwise white plays N13. Here I would play M12.]
;B[if];W[dj]LB[gm:A]C[F; very confusing no idea maybe something earlier?
b: How about G7? If white extends you capture F8 and whites two stones G6,H6 are weak. You might even be able to extend your lower side territory towards the middle.]
;B[dk]C[b: To small];W[ej];B[bi];W[bh];B[ci];W[di]LB[dh:A]C[b: D12 is corect for white]
;B[dh]C[b: Good!];W[hf];B[dg];W[cf];B[fh];W[gh];B[fi];W[gi]
;B[fj];W[mg]C[F: hane at 2 stones  :( i never know when to look for this case and when not
b: The answer is simple: you always have to  look for it, you can never allow it.]
;B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[mj]
(;B[ek]C[b: you are frightend! But there is hardly any threat in those stones. Play G10 instead! This also takes aji out of those stones]

;W[kj];B[hk]C[b: your moves E9 and H9 overlap. Just one of the moves is necessary.]
;W[ig];B[jg];W[jh];B[ih];W[hg];B[kh];W[ji];B[kf]C[This is no success. Living small is painful. White gets profit on three sides of the black group and gets influence on the forth side (the lower side) of the black group.]
