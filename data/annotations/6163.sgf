C[A: Thanks for your time.
In this game we had a long ko fight during middle game,and later i didnt manage to exploit the weak group of my opponent. Also i am not sure what was the optimal play in lower left corner.

N: In this game you played very agressive, sometimes it looked like you were thinking you played a handicap game. At the end you also lost the game because of wanting to kill to much and not looking to the big picture. 

You were very lucky in the lower right, but you should have continued the ko while gently attacking the center group.

Hope this is usefull.

(;W[qn]LB[ql:A][oo:B]C[N: this is a strange move: why do you want to leave a weakness at A ? Now you need another move to stabilize your position.
Things would be different if the upper right corner was white, in that case your move would aim at a follow-up move at B to make a moyo.]

- Black needs to win the ko once, after which the white group is captured.

The ko is easier for black to win, but the loss is greater for black too. However in this case, black can play three times elsewhere if white wants to win the ko: this is a lot!]
