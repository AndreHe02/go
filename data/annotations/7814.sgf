C[Hello.
I would like to go through only a few pointers, as these would fix a large portion of your game. They are:
1. connection - keeping your stones connected or connectable. Connection is what makes stones stronger and gives them a good chance in a fight.

2. Purpose of 3rd and 4th lines.

3. Making a base before attacking

I added comments in the original game tree first, so please read those comments first. I will refer back to additional trees, so it'll make more sense if you play out and read your original game first.]

(;B[fo]C[What was the purpose of F3? What do you intend to gain from playing there?
It looks like outer influence because B seems to be trying to make a wall to face the outside and does not mind if W makes a lot of potential territory in the corner.

BUT, is F5 a good way to make a wall?];W[dn]C[W extends out, it's a natural move and it's good for W.]
;B[jp]TR[fo]C[B extends back to make a 'base'. (Or does it? Triangled stones F5 and K4 are too 'high' to make an efficient base. W can easily play on the 3rd line and get delicious territory.)]
;W[fq]C[Which does happen.];B[gq];W[fp];B[gp];W[eo];B[fn]LB[ip:A]
[qp:B]C[B does make a wall, and W does get the corner. However, W's gain is bigger than B's.
Yes, W's corner can be reduced, but W is still happy because W has a solid base. W can live no matter what and still get a decent chunk of points.

On the other hand, B has this wall, but it still has weaknesses to be exploited. Black's group A (that base in the bottom middle) and group B (lone stone in the corner yet to be settled) can be separated. If they get separated, both groups are vulnerable. Ignoring A is an option, but it doesn't bode well for Black.
You want group A to be solid so you can effectively protect and settle B.

So, let's go back to see other variations 'group A' could have formed in. I have kept the basic intentions the same (making a wall, getting influence)]
;W[ck];B[fe]C[Again, with F15. 
Play on 4th line for influence. OR play on 3rd line for territory.

It is not unheard of to play on 5th line, but you need more skill to back that move up.]

[ck][dn][eo][dp][fp][fq]C[See how W maintains a good feasible connection in his wall?
Even though the stones are spaced out, W can easily fend off invaders because W can connect up and become stronger if W really needs to.]
;B[nc];W[oq]C[W plays 3rd line. Aim: territory.

This makes sense. There is no point for W to make influence here. If W does, the pressure it will exert will just solidify B's groups.]
;B[pr];W[pq];B[qq];W[or];B[qr];W[kq]TR[kr][mr][nr]C[W threatens B, and makes a good base. What's the base I'm always talking about?

Base: triangled area. It's the area where eyes can be made.
You need enough area in a base, AS WELL as having good shape. Good shape is shape that easily makes eyes.

W is connected, B can't separate those groups. W has the wall to help it crush invaders.]

C[B defends a cut. Good. But that situation looks familiar, doesn't it?

If B connects, F14 group lives and W kicks himself. W gets his territory reduced by a lot.]
)))
(;B[je]C[B can solidly stop W. No problems there. Cuts won't work since this is B's kingdom. B has friendly stones nearby to connect up to if there is a cut.
See? Ability to connect to a wonderful thing. It'll save you.

This move has the same purpose as K16, it's just more straightforward and confident.]
))
(;B[fp]C[Have you read through your original game first? If not, please do. Otherwise this part doesn't flow properly as a lesson.

Here are a few variations B can play. They are technically 'joseki', but the point I wish to get across is the *purpose* of the moves. When you play moves that fulfil your purpose without many extranneous moves, you are playing efficiently.

F4 approaches D4.]
(;W[dn]C[W can play the same move as before. W's purpose is the same, to extend out and to gain influence on the left side.]
;B[jp]C[B can do the same kind of move as the original. Extend back and get something like a base.]
;W[fq];B[gp]C[G4 to prevent a bad cut if B played G3.];W[gq]
;B[hq]C[B now has a base to make eyes in later. It's solid, as it's based on 3rd line.

3rd line is great making a base. Why? You are far enough from the wall to get points, but also close enough to make use of the wall to fend off invaders.]
;W[eq]C[B has a base AND faces outside for influence. W gets some territory and influence too, but the trade is equal. 
Now B is solid too and the direction the wall is facing out looks better too.]

(;W[fq]C[What if W plays like this?
B can still get a base and influence.];B[gq];W[eq]C[W has to defend that.]
