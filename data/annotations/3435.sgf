AB[pd][dp]C[Hello reviewer,

KGS has me rated as 13k and I'm playing white against a 15k player. Lately I've been trying to study more fuseki and fundamental Go moves but when I get into a game I seem to get caught up and forget to play reasonable moves all the time. I would highly appreciate your tips throughout the game, as well as a couple spots where I made some notes and thoughts. During handicap games I feel like I'm starting at a disadvantage and I get a little wild with my moves, if you have any thoughts on my opening pattern, I would appreciate any suggestions or different stlyes of play...

Again, I thank you for your time and effort in reviewing my game!

[pc:c][cn:d][qi:e]C[Seems like a really slow move, maybe better at a,b,c?

[Broege: Personally I would try to attack at d but most probably this is too agressive.
As for a steady move I would opt for a or e. B is also good although one may argue that it gives almost whole left side to Black.\]]
;B[cm];W[kb]LB[fq:a][pj:b][dk:c]SQ[nc][ld]C[This move felt like I needed to connect with the marked stones or else I would give up way too much..I'm thinking that i could have left this and run to the middle with the marked stones. Maybe this stone is better at a or b?

[Broege: I don't think that any White stones are in danger now. What is more pressing is the Black moyo on the left.
For a move reducing Black's moyo on the left side - White can play at a (or somewhere near) or try to reduce the framework from the middle - at c. I could recommend c only if you feel more or less certain that Black won't get much territory white attacking this stone.
BTW - if you want to make sure that M16 and O17 stones are safer perhaps Q18 is a move you seek. Moreover it probably won't be ignored by Black because of White R17 next.\]]

[si][sh][sg]C[I ended up winning by 17.5 which isn't that bad really, I felt pretty good about the game overall but I know there are some pretty serious mistakes and would really appreciate a general summary of how you thought I played. If possible, give me some hints as to the top 3 things I should be doing differently.. Thank you for your time and effort on reviewing my game, I really appreciate it.

[Broege: I think that you deserved the win, even if in fact it is mostly due to the capture of G15 group. You definitely made much fewer (and much smaller) mistakes than your opponent and this is what counts (maybe not at dan level, I don't know).

The biggest thing that occured to me is that you allowed your opponent to grab a lot of territory in the beginning and didn't gain anything in compensation (neither territory nor influence). I think that around move 33 Black had a won game - especially that he had both territory and influence.

Maybe you should try reducing such big moyos earlier (or even try not to let your opponent make it). If you allow your opponent make moyo take something for yourself.

The other thing is trying to stabilize the initial groups. Leaving E16 stone alone was quite risky. Try to expand your groups one by one. There is a proverb saying that you should not have two weak groups - that's because many times the opponent will be able to attack them simultaneously - even if both groups will manage to survive it will probably come at a great cost.

Third thing - keep the fighting spirit :)])
