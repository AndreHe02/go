C[[Rich\] - hi, I've made comments through the game with a couple \
of variations. There are some important general points to pick \
up. 

Be a bit bolder, don't focus on small moves that try to surround \
territory. 
When you attack, build up your weak stones by attacking from \
that side. 
Defend with contact plays, attack by keeping a little distance.
And generally, move in the following order of priority:
1) Stabilise your weak groups
2) Threaten his weak groups
3) Take a big point
4) Stop him taking a big point.

I hope you keep enjoying go, maybe we'll meet over the board \
some day :)]
CA[UTF-8];W[dd];B[jp]
C[[Rich\] - generally, advice is to approach the white stone, that \
way you don't give white the choice of how to approach. But this \
is also a big point, so not a bad play.]
;W[pj];B[jd];W[dj];B[qh];W[qn];B[mp]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[on];B[mn]
C[[Rich\] - This move doesn't force a response, make territory or \
build much power. F17 or C7 are bigger.]
;W[gq]
(;B[ir]
C[I'm never really sure of the best way to defend an attack such \
as white's g3 here or if he plays g4 either

[Rich\] - It's not an attack. An attack threatens your stones, \
this is an invasion. His stone is weak and needs to make eyes.This \
sort of move is good, but the stones on that side are already \
fairly strong, so a Very Useful Rule is:

Attack from the weak side.

You'll strengthen your D4 stone, start walling off your corner \
(to make plenty of territory) and can chase him out. See variation.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[go];B[mc]
C[I decided to play a bit defensively here and strengthen my top-right \
position, but perhaps it's a bit too defensive? Maybe I should \
have been concentrating on saving that bottom-left corner?

[Rich\] - this still doesn't seal the corner, I don't think. A \
play like Q17 would have been steadier. But yes, a play like \
C7 or D7 (to put more pressure on his weak group) is needed. \
The following order of importance is almost *always* the way \
to look at things:
1) Stabilise your weak groups
2) Threaten his weak groups
3) Take a big point
4) Stop him taking a big point.

D6 would be 1 and 2 together!

This is also an illustration of why you should attack on the \
weaker side :)]
;W[cn]
(;B[bo]
C[[Rich\] - To defend, use contact plays. To attack, steer clear \
of them. Contact plays make both sides stronger. See vars.]
;W[eo]
C[[Rich\] - this is excellent for white, you're sealed in, which \
is good because all his stones are still playing an active part \
int the game, while yours can only affect that small corner at \
best.

I think you're dead there if white moves first.]

(;B[gc]
C[[Rich\] -  A bit like N17, this is a half-move. It doesn't quite \
approach the white stone, doesn't quite settle territory. F17 \
or F16 would be ideal here. See var.]
;W[ec]
C[[Rich\] - Big mistake by him. As you saw, he should have played \
around D14. You took good advantage.]
;B[cg]
C[I decided that I wanted to prevent him getting a large area on \
the left side

[Rich\] - Excellent play. Again, why a two-space approach? A play \
at C14 would be more threatening to the corner invasion and give \
you more room to spread out when he responds. Large knight's \
approaches to the 4-4 point are quite rarely seen.]
;W[cf];B[cj]
C[[Rich\] - it's almost always good to anwer a contact play if you're \
planning to save the stone, skipping away leaves your initial \
stone weak.]
;W[bn]
C[[Rich\] - two ignored contact plays in a row! Cancels out, I guess... \
:)]
;B[co]
(;W[do]
C[[Rich\] - I think if he'd played C2 here, your corner would have \
died. See var.]
;B[cr]
C[[Rich\] - you got the key point :)]
;W[ck];B[ci];W[dk];B[eh]
C[[Rich\] - this is big for you, making sure you don't get shut \
in. b14 is also very big for you, he is almost forced to respond \
and it helps you get eyes.]
;W[bf]
C[[Rich\] - he should have played b13 here.]
;B[bg];W[bk]
;B[bj]
C[[Rich\] - this is just endgame, a couple of points. The hane at \
D14 is much moch important, or a play at E14 or G12.]
;W[ai];B[aj];W[ag];B[bh];W[ah];B[bi];W[af];B[df];W[de]
;B[ef];W[dh];B[di];W[gk]
C[[Rich\] - this is a small move. It doesn't pressure your group, \
it tries to make points from thickness. Another Important Rule:

Don't try and surround territory using influence or thickness.]
;B[rc]
C[Again, perhaps this is too defensive?

[Rich\] - Waaaaay too defensive :) Especially since you've already \
played a pure defensive move here at N17. P11 is bigger, or G11would \
look to expand your centre and restrict his.]
;W[er];B[an];W[ak];B[bm];W[cm]
;B[bq];W[jn];B[ng]
C[
[Rich\] - Why back towards your stones? P11 surrounds a much broader \
area. Expand! :)]
;W[qi];B[ph];W[gg];B[fg];W[gh];B[dg]
C[
[Rich\] - you don't need to play here until he plays E11. E10, \
F11 or G14, are both bigger.]
;W[ff]
;B[fh];W[fi];B[lf]
C[Maybe I should have tried to expand my territory more here, perhaps \
with k13 or something?


[Rich\] - Absolutely! No more half moves, be ambitious! It's always \
more fun to lose (and learn) because you're too ambitious than \
because you're too timid, anyway ;)]

;B[rg];W[rq];B[rr];W[qp];B[pr];W[hc];B[hd]
C[I wasn't really sure of the best way to deal with this invasion...


[Rich\] - good start, I think.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[id]
(;B[fe]
C[
[Rich\] - this is where you lose points. A play at J15 is perfect, \
he's down to two liberties and will have to struggle to escape. \
See var.]
;W[gb]
C[
[Rich\] - fortunately, he fails to extend at J15 and you get a \
break :)]

;W[gd];B[fc];W[fb];B[ed];W[dc];B[ko]
C[
[Rich\] - this is very small, jumping out at N8 threatens to jump \
into his right side or his centre.]

side.]

than his right, if you can save your lower left then you have \
a comfy win!]

(;B[dn]
C[[Rich\] - if you want to play this side, this is the natural move. \
It lets white make territory on the white side, but weakens his \
lower group. See also other var.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[em];B[fn]
C[[Rich\] - you've split his groups and the lower side is looking \
*very* weak now.]
)
(;B[cr]
C[[Rich\] - this is a useful move first. If he ignores it, E2 will \
give you a reasonable-sized corner (given your starting position); \
if he responds to it, you can carry on at D6 as in the other \
variation. His response can't guarantee him two eyes at the bottom, \
so that group will still become weak.]
