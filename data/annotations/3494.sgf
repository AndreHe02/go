AB[dd][pp]C[Handicap game
26k against 28k
i'm black (28k)];W[pd]C[Why does white start???
It is like I only had a one stone handicap.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

With evenly matched opponents you take turns playing black and white.
With one rank difference in strenght the weaker player always take black.  Black plays one stone, and then it's white's turn.
With two ranks difference in strenght the weaker player always take black.  Black "plays" two stones, and then it's white's turn.

The notion "It is like I only had a one stone handicap" is simply wrong.]
;B[gd]TR[dq][cq][cp][dp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

G16 is too defensive and overpopulates the corner.
A lot better (and fuseki) would be to play one of the marked points.
Remember a hoshi stone (a stone on the 4-4 point in the corner) is NOT weak.  Also remember a hoshi stone is a play for INFLUENCE not for TERRITORY.

Order of play:
First the corners, then the sides, lastly the centre if there's any territory left.  This is important.  Take the corners.]
;W[jd]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

White really should have jumped on the opportunity and played D4 here instead.]
;B[ce]TR[dq][cq][dp][cp]MA[cj]C[The right extention?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Why extend?  D16 and G16 already form a strong settlement in the corner.  Black 4 had been a lot better spent if played on or close to D4.
If -for some reason- black should extend from his strong corner I feel C10 whould be the right spot to extend to.]
;W[md];B[dj]TR[dq][cq][cp][dp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

No........
TAKE THE CORNER!];W[dp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

With white D4 black has given away his chance of starting off with three corners.  Black is overpopulated and too thick in the upper left corner.
At this point the black and white positions are already equal. Way too early for black to let white catch up.]
;B[dm]TR[gp][fp][fq]MA[qj][jq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

D7 is too small and overprotective.
F3, F4, G4 mark good attacks.
K3 and R10 are sensible expansions.
I would have played F3.];W[gp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Lucky for black that white is just as overprotective and unexpansive as himself.]
;B[pm]TR[qf][qj][jq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Q7 is too small.  The marked spots would be better.];W[nq];B[oq]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

P3 is a good and strong response to O3.  Especially with Q7 already in place.
Normal continuation would be
White O4
Black P4
White L4
Black elsewhere...];W[no];B[nr]TR[qf]MA[jj][jp][qc][cq]C[At this state, I was wondering if my opening was good.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Yes and no.

Relatively speaking it's good because you've now managed to get a few points (perhaps 20?) ahead of your opponent.
But in the bigger scheme of things it's sub-optimal.
You could have had three corners, but are left with only two.
The three stones in the D16 corner are too close for this early in the game, making you too thick in that area.
The two stones D7 and D10 are also too close, you're too thick here too.
In the Q4 corner Q7 is too defensive and way too close, and O2 is simply a wasted stone.  The situation there is stable now, and you should forget about it to care about bigger things.

Instead of black O2 I think R14 would have been best.
I have marked four other points to consider.  They're all of interest, albeit some probably better than others.  All five suggestions would have been better than O2.]
;W[mr];B[mq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Good.  When white chose to attack the way he did, this was a strong response.]
;W[lq];B[np];W[mp];B[or]C[KO fight starts

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Really no need for a ko fight.
I think it would make more sense simply to secure at O3.];W[nq]
;B[op]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Again, a strong move.
Again, black can now look at bigger moves on other parts of the board.]
;W[mo];B[mq]TR[qf]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Wrong!  The ko is worthless.  Almost any play anywhere on the board would be bigger.  -As long as you don't play on the first line.
There is no doubt: Forget the ko!  Take sente!  Attack your opponent! Play R14!]
;W[lr];B[ms]TR[qf]MA[pi][ph]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Normally you NEVER play on the first line until the very end of the endgame.  N1 is not only small, it's utterly and completely gote.  Putting on a blindfold and throwing a stone somewhere on the board would very likely have been a better move.

R14 is the move to make here.
It attacks the white corner.  It extends from your strong bastion to make ready for grabbing almost the entire flank with Q11 or Q12.  With luck (if white is neglient) you might even get to extend to S16 later.]
;W[ls];B[on]TR[qf]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

R14!
Forget the puny border squibble for now!];W[oo];B[po];W[nn]
;B[nm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

With both you and your opponent intent on keeping on here Q5 and O7 makes sense locally.
But you would have gained more by ignoring white's tiny attack and played (you guessed it!) R14.]
;W[mm];B[ns]TR[lp][nl]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

N1 is worthless.  Don't bother protecting it.  Not until the very very end of the game.  O8 would have been a lot bigger. The cut at M4 would have been a good long-term investment.  But both are relatively small moves.  I still think R14 is the move you should have played.]
;W[nl];B[om]TR[qf]MA[pi][ph][rd]C[Should I have played at P8, occasionning a KO?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

NO!  Just as the ko at O3 it won't be worth anything.  You should simply give white the stone.  Hell, let him take a few.  Keep on expanding on the edge.

There is no reason to creep along with white's small moves when instead you could grab sente, leap ahead and make a big glorious expansion.

Corners first, then edges, centre last if there's any territory left!
In this game you've gone straight from securing two corners to quarreling about the centre.]
;W[ol];B[pl]TR[qf]MA[lp][ml][pk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

The three X's are better local moves.  It should be self-evident why Q9 is better than Q8.
But I would still prefer R14.];W[pj];B[lp]C[Sould I block white stone at Q10?
(by playing R10, for exemple)

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

R10 would invite white R9.  That is no good.  What you SHOULD have done was leave white alone and extend along the edge many moves ago.  In the current situation I personally think the cut on M4 is OK.  I believe R14 would still be a very strong move.]
;W[lo];B[kp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

L4 can be sensible.  If you realise already now that it can work as a double-edged sword to attack both the M1 group and the M5 group.  And if you at the same time decide that if you don't capture anything the stones played will be a tolerable loss. (I think they are.)
Still, even here I would consider forgetting about the M4 stone, taking sente, and play R14.

Black R14
White R15
Black Q14
White Q15
Black Q11 (or R11)
would be good for black.];W[kq];B[jp]TR[jq][ko]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

K4 is questionable.  Try reading the future game out, and explore if K3 or L5 could be more beneficial.
With K3 white can cut on K4 with atari.  The ladder that starts on L5 then is no real danger to black: D10 is a ladder-breaker.
K3 can be atari'd by white.  But atari by playing J3 would be stupid of white, and atari on K2 whould let black run towards liberties.

You are ATTACKING here!  It is white that's in trouble.  It should have been white that needed to keep safe and make connections. Even if white can sort of connect by taking the O3 ko you still have great ko threats to play against white's two corners.  All in all I think K4 is keeping it TOO safe and not offensive enough. Keep sente; keep pushing.  As long as white risks losing his stones, he's no time to attack yours.]
;W[jq];B[iq];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[jr]TR[gq]C[Stupid move

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Yup.  G3 would have been better.  If white keeps creeping on the second line, follow suit on the third.  Even if white manages to live, so will you.  And then white would live cramped and small on the second line.  On the line of death.  The influence and outward power of your wall on the third line  would outweigh the white territory BY FAR.  Not to mention putting G4 and D4 in peril if you both kept on extending that far.]
;W[js];B[ml]TR[gq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Why not G3?  With a little "luck" you could connect on O3 next move, and separate the white groups for ever.]
;W[lm];B[kl]C[Is it a good extention?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

White can play atari on M8 and at the same time run for safety in the centre.  By leaving the gap open you actually INVITE this. M8 would be better.]
;W[ll];B[mk];W[ok];B[oj]TR[ic][qc][qf][co][gq]MA[pk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

White P9 was gote.  If you should answer it Q9 is better.
But there are several other points of bigger interest.];W[pk]
;B[pi]MA[lo][mp][mo][no][oo][nn][mm][lm][ll]C[I'm not sure, but I think that I should have extended my territory instead of trying to capture this white group.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I agree.  The marked white stones are far from being guaranteed two eyes yet.  There should be ways to attack them.  And if they survive by winning the ko fight on O3 that will mean you get to play two stones in a row on another part of the board.  A win-win situation.
Besides, P10 and Q11 are single vulnerable stones.];W[qi];B[oh]
TR[ph]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Q12 is better.
And why not consider ignoring white at this point, take sente and play a big attack elsewhere?]

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

Just as with stone #76 at C4 I think you're jumping one too far. White can cut you off at J17 now and you will have to struggle to live.  Black J17 is better.

And remember, you can always play elsewhere.
I have marked three points to consider in particular.

H9 builds territory and reinforces the border.

R17 invades the corner and should be able to survive.

R12 aims at cutting white apart to capture the white stones on O8.  White S12 would be fantastic for black.  Black atari on R10, white captures and black closes the trap with R9.]

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

All in all you played well, considering your rank.  Both sides did some mistakes.  But take comfort in the fact that most of your mistakes are easy to remedy and this game should give you good examples of things to look for and things to avoid.

Begin in the corners, then edges, centre last.
Don't keep small or local fights going for too long.
Always look for other / bigger moves.
Take sente!

Don't worry about reading joseki or fuseki.  But keep in mind that moves you make early in the game will have consequences much later on, and remember that often stones will have effect on other parts of the board.

Good luck!])
