C[Game review by SpaceDog
11k* on NNGS (and a lowly 19k* on IGS)

This review was requested by grumm, who was black.

I've used labels on the board, but I'm not sure all SGF readers see these, so in all such instances I also give the coordinates.]
;B[pp]C[I should stress I'm not particularly strong, but since you're just starting out, I hope my comments are helpful.]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jq]LB[jp:a]C[K4 would be more normal, but for reasons that are beyond my capacity to explain...]
;W[pj];B[dj]LB[jc:a]C[Although all your stones "work" together (ie are close enough to help each other control space), this does encourage white's next move, which already makes the opening look slightly boring (though not necessarily bad).

I personally would probably play at K17 to split white's stones up. But I'm not sure this is actually objectively better than your move.]
;W[jd]C[The point now is that any invasion by either side into the other's territory will come under a fairly strong attack, which should allow the attacker to strengthen his position.

Just by threatening to kill, one can usually take territory or build up influence.

So, this is what I mean when I say the game may be a bit boring, if neither side is willing to invade.

Still, this is the type of opening I understand least, so you should perhaps not take what I say as gospel.]
;B[cg]LB[cf:a][bd:b][cc:c]C[If you want to approach an enemy stone on the 4-4 point, playing one point closer than you do is standard (ie at C14), as it works well with a later jump to b (B16 here) or even c (C17).]
;W[jj]C[I'm not sure about the value of this. Territory in the corners is the easiest to defend, then territory on the sides, while territory in the centre is the hardest to hold.

On the other hand, white does now have a huge *potential* territory over on the right side, so you're going to have to invade sooner or later. Sooner would probably be best, before he has a chance to secure it.]
;B[pl];W[gm]C[This move is intended to reduce your potential territory here.]
;B[dm]TR[gm]LB[bo:a]C[OK.

Perhaps at this point I should mention that stones on the 4th line are more geared to outer influence (which will later be used for attack and so on) while the 3rd line is more territory oriented.

Given than white's stone at G7 is cutting down the value of your influence (sort of blocking it, if you will...), a move on the 3rd line might be preferable. I'm not sure though. But a white invasion may still be possible at around B5, so this territory may not be totally secure yet.]
;W[gp];B[gq]C[Since white played here first, a contact move will allow him to threaten your stone first, which is why he is able to push some stones down into a position where they still threaten to take away some of your territory on either side here.]
;W[hq];B[fq]C[This seems correct to me.];W[hr];B[mq]LB[hp:a]
[io:b]C[White has a weakness at H4 now.

While I don't think actually cutting it immediately will work, you could maybe play at J5, threatening the cut. White should defend by connecting, after which you could then play at N3 as you do here, but your stone at J5 would work well with the stones on the right.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr]C[Yes.];W[os];B[rq];W[qr]
;B[rr];W[rs];B[ns]LB[ms:a]C[This isn't necessary, as if white played there you could keep him in with N1.

Perhaps you should take the opportunity to invade white's moyo (potential territory) now, as you have no urgent moves.

This is a very important aspect of Go - knowing when to play away from the current area of play to do something bigger elsewhere. It's sometimes unclear whether to do this or not, but on this occasion, you absolutely should, as your move was not needed.]
;W[ro]C[I'm not sure white's next sequence should work.];B[rp]
;W[rm];B[rl];W[rk];B[qm]LB[sl:a][ql:b][rn:c]C[T8 is where you want to play if you are to stop white connecting. If he then threatens with b, you play R7 then, after he defends, play S6, killing white's stone.]
;W[sl];B[ql];W[qn];B[pn];W[nl];B[qo];W[rn];B[nm]LB[ok:a]C[Hmm. Since you're not really going to make much territory in this area (certainly not enough to combat the potential white has got), I'd recommend a more fighting move, like P9, cutting white's stone and pushing into his potential territory.

Or, again, you could take this opportunity to invade.];W[mm]
C[Here we see what I said earlier: the player who initiates a contact fight is at a disadvantage.]
;B[mn];W[om];B[nn];W[ol];B[pm];W[on];B[oo];W[lm];B[ln];W[kn]
;B[ko];W[jn];B[fd]LB[fc:a][db:b][ib:c]C[I think a move at F17 would be better, threatening D18 or J18, or both.]
;W[ee]C[Cutting your stone off from contact with C13.];B[dc]
;W[cc];B[db]LB[ec:a]C[E17 would I think be more normal.

Now that you've played D18, if white were to play E17, you might find yourself in trouble.]
;W[cb];B[ed];W[ce];B[id]C[A contact move again.];W[ic];B[hc]
;W[hd];B[gd];W[ie];B[he];W[hf];B[id];W[ge];B[hd];W[jf];B[jc]
;W[ib];B[kd];W[je];B[nd]TR[ic][ib]LB[kb:a]C[White's next move shows why a move to kill the two white stones was urgent. I'm not sure precisely where would be best. Perhaps L18, defending the weakness at L17 and locking the white stones in.]
;W[kc];B[jb];W[kb];B[hb];W[ja]C[Now your two black stones are in real trouble, surrounded by white stones.]
;B[ld];W[lf];B[pf];W[oe]C[Yes. This shows that a jump like your last move (two diagonals away) is easily cut apart. But in all honesty, the black stones already seem dead, or very close to it. I don't see a way to save them.]
;B[pc]C[This is tricky. Perhaps black's best try.];W[oc];B[qc]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[re];B[sd];W[se];B[rc];W[rb]LB[od:a]C[I think white should defend his weakness at P16.]

(;B[ob]LB[od:a]TR[pd][qd][re][se]C[And you should probably play there, as it threatens both white's stone at P17 and the four white stones to the right of it.

See the variation.];W[nb];B[nc]C[Yes.];W[od];B[mb]LB[pb:a][sb:b]
C[As you discover later, black can still be killed here. So I think Q18 followed by T18 would have been correct, though you would still lose four stones (because white has time to play N18 himself.]
;W[ne];B[lc]C[Well, black should take the stone at O18 off the board.]

;W[qk];B[sj];W[sk];B[rg];W[qf];B[qg];W[og];B[pg];W[ok];B[cq]
C[Your group on the right isn't safe yet.];W[ph]LB[sh:a]C[I think white T12 reduces black to one eye.]
;B[qh];W[oh];B[sh]C[And black has two eyes.];W[kq];B[kr];W[lo]

;B[fe];W[fg];B[gf];W[gg];B[ef];W[de];B[ff];W[cf];B[df];W[ci]
C[Yes, this was always this problem here. I think you should have played here first.]
;B[bi];W[cj];B[bj];W[ck];B[bk];W[ag];B[bh];W[ah]LB[di:a]C[White should connect at D11.]

;B[hg];W[hh];B[if];W[ig];B[hf];W[jh];B[fm];W[gl];B[fl];W[fn]
;B[en]LB[em:a]C[Well, I didn't see the threat here myself...

But black should probably play E7 instead.];W[el];B[dl];W[fk]

C[Black resigns.

I think you're playing better than I did when I was a beginner.

Try reading some of the more elementary books (but beyond the learn-the-rules type). One suggestion would be "The Second Book of Go".

I hope some of this helps.])
(;B[od];W[nc]LB[pe:a]C[White tries to escape with that stone (he should actually defend the weakness of Q15).]
;B[pe];W[qe];B[rf]C[And white's stones die.]))
