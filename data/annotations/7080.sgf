AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[I'm B, playing on kgs with a 4-stone handicap.  I lost by around 40, but the game felt close until around move 200, when I lost the last potentially decisive fight.

All advice is appreciated, but I didn't play my best in yose due to time pressure, so my mistakes there may be less educational than the errors I made in the opening and middle-game.

Thanks very much in advance!];W[nq];B[qn];W[fq];B[hp]C[XX Maybe something that attacks both white stones like K4 is better -- but the pincer is the right idea for sure!]
;W[fo];B[dn];W[hr];B[jd];W[qf];B[ph];W[of];B[nc]C[XX  -- maybe O16 is better -- keep the white stones underpressure]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rh];B[ri]C[XX -- too early - that stone is light - and white will not make points around there -- so you can move somewhere else -- like C10]
;W[qi];B[qh]C[This felt wrong but seemed to work.  Did W misplay, or is the wall he gains sufficient compensation for the territory he loses?
