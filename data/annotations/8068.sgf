C[Hi thanks for taking the time to review my game. This was a very odd game from the beginning. I have only been playing a few months and have some obvious weaknesses. There are certain times I am just at a loss. I will comment and try to point out the times I'm especially confused. Also, this is an incomplete game as my opponent left, but I feel there is much to learn from it. Also, I am playing as black.

Mark: Hello, Josh. I'm Mark, Runaway (3-5kyu) on KGS I'm from Canada. Thanks for giving me the pleasure of reviewing your game for you.]

(;W[dq]C[Mark: This is a very weird joseki. According to an Online go dictionary on Eidogo.com, which a Canadian 5dan approves of, this move is an innovation of Kitani Minoru. I've never seen this one before.

(;W[dr]C[I don't know josekis that well but I was almost certain this was off line.

Mark: This wall is now hard to use.  it should've turned into a very scary fight.]

;B[cg]TR[ep][eq][er]SQ[do][cp][ip][dq][hq]C[Mark: this is not big enough, the triangles need a doctor, and quick. it's about half the size of the urgent F6. your stones are surrounded.]
;W[bh];B[bg]C[I felt like this odd sequence was good for me, the corner was very tiny and the side territory plus the thickness towards the center certainly is bigger.

Mark: thank your opponent for giving you that one move.];W[gf]
C[Mark: here's a 2 point move. that's 2 handicaps in three of your opponent's moves, and move 126 gave you an additional 4 points. You are winning now. Thank your opponent very much.]

;W[pl]C[And my opponent left at this point. I felt I had the advantage but overall was a sloppy but interesting game. Too often I just am not certain where to go, especially during invasions. And I'm not certain if I was playing well or if my oppenent was making bigger mistakes.

Mark: I would be lying if i didn't say that it had a few mistakes that included passing and giving away free food.

1. Try to judge which groups are weak. If there are weak groups, those are first priority.

2. don't be tricked, the corners are huge. 

3.You were winning, but you still had a good chance at losing this game.

4. Dont give in-game handicaps (free moves).

Thank you for sharing this game.])
