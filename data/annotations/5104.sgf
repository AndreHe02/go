RE[B+11.5]

C[Note from submitter (krinid):
I'm playing white in this game.

While I lost, I feel that I should have won this one, and I'm wondering 
where my mistakes were.

I'm interested in moves I could have played better to improve my shape, 
style, territory, misplays, overplays, missed opportunities, played an ooba 
instead of a kyuuba, played in the wrong ooba, order of play, sente/gote, 
joseki/tesuji misplays or completely missing the potential to play them, 
etc.

Thanks in advance for the review.

ulys:
This game is interesting, as you could have taken the lead many times. Even 
if most of your moves were all right, you made some mistakes which allowed 
him to win.

Is this f4 play good?  It seems that white H3 could make it less effective, 
but then maybe a black pincer would bring a fight on.

ulys:
I think F4 comes too soon. Usually, san-san's aim is too emphasize territory 
at the expense of influence. F4 s aim is too gain influence, so it seems 
strange.
Anyway, if White had played D6 for instance, his oogeima would have been a 
good answer
That leads me to the main point : White F4 comes too soon, because he has 
already secured this corner. This is a very defensive move. Playing an other 
corner would be more dynamic.]
(;W[pq];B[cc]C[krinid:
I don't see 3-3 fuseki very often - is this considered good?  It seems like 
if someone plays 4-4, then it's more a less the same as a 3-3 invasion which 
is considered to be good for the 4-4 player (here, white).  The only 
difference is that the 3-3 player (here, black) gets an extra play in the 
corner.

ulys:
No, this is the traditional answer for san-san. It leads to many joseki.]

I thought for sure that with the middle black group dying, I'd win for sure, 
but it was not to be.

Where did I make mistakes or miss out on opportunities?
