C[What should I have played now? I played f4, but I'm not sure
anymore, if that
was right. What about e3? Or maybe f5 and try to connect? Or
ignore
the approach move and play j7?

TWH:  I think your move at F4 is alright, and better than E3
or F5.  But your follow-up was not best.];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[go]C[TWH:  I think you must play at H3 and then extend as in the sequence
shown.]
(;B[hr];W[hq];B[gr];W[gq];B[dn]C[TWH:  White should play J3 and Black has no good answer.]

(;W[fn];B[im];W[hn];B[in];W[fr];B[iq];W[kl];B[hm];W[gm]C[TWH:  Black does not have a realistic chance of surrounding either
White group.  So, he should strive for two goals of helping his
center group around J10, and taking territory on the left.  The
next move at E8 pretends to surround White (which is not possible),
and doesn't help either real goal.  I think Black should play
either J10 or D8.]
(;B[el];W[gl];B[ik];W[ck];B[fj];W[gj];B[fk];W[gk];B[di];W[ci]
;B[ch];W[dj]C[TWH:  Black should connect at E11 keeping one connected group
for himself, and cutting white into two weaker groups.  The result
of starting the ko and ignoring the threat was that White ends
up with one strong group and Black has two weaker groups.]
(;B[bi];W[bj];B[cj];W[em]C[Now I filled the ko. Should I have defended at d7 better? Did
I have any good ko-threats?

TWH:  Yes,  you should defend at D7.  You do have two ko threats
around R8, but White has many more so you can't win this ko.]

;B[jk];W[ll];B[lk]C[TWH:  White can live easily starting at K4.]

(;W[or]C[TWH:  Black is in some trouble now because he needs two moves
to protect against a White cut at N9, and to protect his weak
group at B16.  You found a way to protect against the cut at
N9 by capturing four white stones, but then your other Black
group gets attacked at C14.];B[lp];W[mp];B[lq];W[lr];B[kr];W[jp]
;B[ip];W[mr];B[ln];W[lo];B[kn];W[cf];B[ef]C[When I pulled out my group. white got a lot of territory. How
should I have played?

TWH:  I don't think there is a good way.];W[fd];B[gf];W[hd]
C[TWH:  Black doesn't like to play B9 because it weakens his corner
group.];B[bk];W[bl];B[aj];W[al];B[ak];W[fg];B[df];W[ce];B[gg]
;W[fh];B[ff]C[TWH:  White could cut at D13.]

;W[eh];B[dh];W[ji];B[jd];W[lc]C[this was probably bad, right?

TWH:  I think K17 would be better.]
(;B[id];W[hc]C[TWH:  It seems more natural to attack the lone white stone by
playing O17 first, before extending along the right side.]
(;B[qh];W[qf]C[TWH:  White is very aggressive here to create a second weak group
in this same area -- probably an overplay.];B[pf];W[pg];B[qe]

;W[jb]C[TWH:  Capturing two white stones is much too small.  Black should
either capture the upper side starting with L18,  or capture
nine white stones in the center with the sequence starting at
P10.]
