C[Hello,

it would be kind if I could any advice or comment on any part of this game.

The game was played not so long ago on the KGS server. I played with the black stones, so it would be great to get some comment on these moves. Here and there I added some comment myself, what i was thinking and so on.

Well, I hope you enjoy the review,
thanks,
Rolf.];B[pd]C[johnyB [10k\]: hi
Florreke [10k\]: hello];W[qq];B[dp];W[cc];B[pp]C[this opening sequence suggests that black is going to try to take the center.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[or];B[qo];W[nq];B[pj]C[Q10 is not too far ? I often play R8 now instead, because of safety

it is good to start to delinate a big moyo
so far black is in good shape];W[cn];B[fq];W[bp];B[cq]C[c3 is good but I think not consistent with the opening
some alterantives are k16 and f16. However c3 is good solid play

so far black is in good shape];W[ck];B[jd];W[qf];B[pf]C[attaching to a stone is a defensive move
because of k16 it is appropiate to play in this way

there are different styles of play but so far all of black moves 
have been reasonable];W[pg];B[qe];W[of];B[pe];W[og];B[nd];W[me]
;B[md];W[df];B[qg]C[I expected white to R12 and then Q11, but white was smarter than that]
;W[qh];B[rf];W[rg]C[black can start a ko fight with q12 that would be very difficult for white or enclose the white group]

(;B[fc]C[f17 is not consistent with the way tha black has played so far
black should attack the white stones in the center];W[fe];B[hd]
;W[jq];B[bq]C[black is giving up the center. There is an inconsistency on black strategy]
;W[nj];B[rj];W[oi];B[mn]C[Maybe better Q8 ?];W[ol];B[pl];W[om]
C[black needs to conect with n6]
(;B[ok];W[nk];B[nm];W[on];B[qm];W[no];B[dj]C[I remember that at this point I didn't see any better move. Maybe C12 better ? What about K10 ? No, C12...

you right. at this point black position is difficult.
one option is to extend from safe base. 
for example e7 or h13];W[cj];B[dh];W[fh];B[ci]C[Maybe F11 would have been a bit better here ... I was thinking that C11 takes away a bit of white's territory, but now I end up with a *very nice* shape, and I'm still proud that it was alive at the end of the game  ;-)]

C[Well, a bit of help here would be useful. Wanted to catch the white stones I admit, but forgot that white is so thick all around and that black M15 doesn't really work]

in general I think it was a good play from black
a point to improve is to be consisent on the game strategy]
