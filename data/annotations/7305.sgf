C[Hi, my name is Jakob, I'm from Germany and i am your reviewer for today.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cc];B[jc]C[So, I like to expand my territory early rather than play defensive and my understanding is a move like this is more territorial.]
;W[ed];B[jp]C[And a move like this is more influential.  So I felt like balancing.]
;W[gq];B[hq]C[I saw he was threatening my territory and wanted to give one last push of my own while threatening his.

This feels too heavy to me. You are comitting to defending K4 now, which isn't really endangered. A pincer at around N3 isn't a big threat. Sure, you would lose part of your moyo donw there, but you would gain outside influence on return. That's why you played on the 4th line in the 1st place.]
;W[hp];B[hr]C[I think this was a bad move on my part. I always heard stretch on the hane, but I think I should've stretched the other way.  I thought I was closing off my territory more but that was obviously a mistake.

J3 would have been better indeed.];W[gr]
(;B[gc]C[Expanding my territory more while attacking his.

Too small at this point. This kind of move is reserved for the last few moves of the opening. The areas around Q10 and D10 are huge and uncontested yet.
Also, having invested several stones on the lower side, defending your weak point at J3 should be thought about. See var next turn]

(;W[fb]C[Much too small either. He feels threatened in his corner territory, which is just unnecessary. Very little is at stake here. His 2 stones in the corner were safe before, and the amount of territory he protects is very small.]
;B[fc]C[Threatened to split his group to strengthen my position next turn.  Maybe it was bad because I also strengthened his position as well...

Locally, a good move i believe. But This move is even smaller then the one before.]

(;W[ec]C[Threatening to split to strengthen my position.  Probably a mistake, because it strengthened his as well... maybe just neutral.

Too small! Giving up F18 and taking one of the huge spots on either side is infinitely bigger. See variation.]
;B[gb]C[Too small. Endgame move. White should not react.];W[fa]
C[Too small. This is an endgame move. Black should not react.]
;B[ga]C[small];W[db]C[Still too small. Giving up the 2 stones in the corner might look very bad after after playing all these stones in the corner. But you fought about a very small prize in the first place, so even at this point it would be better to omit defending the 2 stones. You fight for maybe 4 points here.]
;B[dj]C[I figured I had enough room to create some territory in there and possibly attack one of his territories, or at least lessen.  Considering that was a goal, a move on the third line probably would've been better in retrospect.

Finally a big move! But you are right, creating a base on the left side by playing C10 is probably better here.]
;W[ch]
(;B[dl]C[He attacked so I expanded the other way to get some territory.  However, being on the fourth line makes that iffy.

Too heavy, too close to your other stone. Playing to defend D10 is necessary though, otherwise white's territory on the left would become huge. See variations.]
;W[eh];B[di]C[Dumb move.  I just wanted to threaten to split, no real reason since it wasn't really a threat anyways.  Thus, dumb pointless move.

True.];W[fd]C[Too small! R10 is huge!]
(;B[cn]C[Trying to make sure that that becomes a territory.

Still to small. Your group on the left is not in immediate danger. See variations.]

(;W[bp]C[There are bigger ones out there, but this move is still ok.]
;B[co]C[I wanted to threaten the split again, while possibly being able to strengthen my position.  A better threat than the last because I might actually split him, but not much better.

You are right. Splitting him there would mean only a handful of points. Also it does not even seem to threaten his stones, see variation next turn]

(;W[cp];B[ho]C[Again, too small. The right is open for taking.]
;W[gp];B[go]C[Looking back, I regard this as a horrible move.  For some reason, I thought that I could infiltrate that corner.  Maybe if my goal was to connect my two groups it would be ok, but with the way I played I consider it a mistake.

Right. His corner is safe as houses. Look at all the thickness. Locally, you should be more worried about J3. Still, nobody seems interested in R10...]
;W[iq]C[Losing those two pieces.  I should've played more safe at the marked spot.

True];B[ir]C[Foolishly trying to survive.

Again, these 2 stones aren't worth enough to justify not playing on the right, even if there was a chance to save them.]
;W[jq]C[Defending these 2 stones makes your opponent crawl into your territory]
;B[jr];W[ip];B[io];W[kp];B[jo];W[kr];B[mq]C[Trying to get some territory out of this deal and not giving him room to expand.

This move feels very wrong to me. You play very close to his strength, actually closer then to your own stone. Also, this invites the move into the corner.]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[I figured I had two choices, and this one forces him towards my other piece, possibly trapping him. Here was the other.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[rq]C[I wanted the corner really bad and figured that I still had him trapped.

No. Without interfering stones, and N3 is too far away to have much effect, the 3-3-invasion will always live. The attacker gets the corner, while the defender gets good outside influence. (There might be situations where an opponent will at some point opt to sacrifice the corner to get something more valuable in return, but this should be rare.)]

(;W[nq]C[Here it gets messy. S2 would have been simpler, but picking a fight is a reasonable option. Black's stone at N3 is severely weakened by the white wall to the left.]

(;B[op];W[mr];B[np];W[mp]C[But I let him escape and connect.]
;B[nr];W[lq];B[pr]C[So I settle for a controlled retreat to solidify my position in the corner.

This is a good result for you.];W[nq]C[Waaaaaaaaay too small. This is 1 single point if im not mistaken.]

(;B[qr]C[Locally, P1 is better. Overall, Q10 is infinitely bigger.]
;W[ns]C[Again he picks for crumbs.
My wild psychological guess would be that after losing the corner, he feels that he got less out of that fight then he should have (which is actually true). But trying to remedy the situation and still make some profit in this area is just plain wrong. In go it is very important to accept your own mistakes and move on.]
;B[os]C[tiny, and even obviously wrong]
(;W[nr];B[ps];W[mn]C[Finally he is taking steps towards the right side of the board.  Still just playing R10 is easier and bigger.]
;B[om]C[I wanted to again, expand my territory and try and decrease his group's influence.]
;W[no]C[This move does very little. You should not feel threatened.]

(;B[on]C[Not necessary. See var.];W[oo];B[po];W[qc]C[Wrong timing. This will make an invasion on the right side of the board a lot harder.]
;B[qd]C[Again, trying to force him towards my group, although this one has quite a bit more room for him.]
;W[pc];B[rc]C[You are forcing him outwards. Rather play P17. Give him the corner; the outwards influence you gain in return is worth more.]
;W[oc];B[rb]C[This move does about nothing]
(;W[qb]C[The route towards the left and middle is wide open]

(;B[mb]C[Trapping him.

Ok. I would have played higher though. You cant keep him from escaping to the middle, but there is no need to make it too easy for him.]
;W[nb]C[Trying to live on the side is possible, but wrong. Getting closed in would be ruinous for white.]
;B[mc];W[nd]
(;B[eo]C[Still stubbornly trying to attack the corner...

Little to gain here];W[nc]C[Not of much use. O17 and P16 are pretty much miai. O18 can be sacrificed.]
;B[oe];W[md];B[lc];W[ma]C[endgame move];B[la]C[same];W[na]C[same]
;B[mm]C[Again, trying to take away his influence.

Very good move.];W[lm];B[km]C[Not necessary to pick a fight here. Also locally you step into a bad position here. Without doing any reading, you can make a few assumptions about the involved stones here:  N7 is weak. Playing here will make white strengthen M7, which further weakens N7.]
;W[ml]C[And failing.];B[nm];W[ln];B[ep];W[eq];B[ao]C[Should be B5 locally]
;W[mh];B[ph]C[Solidifying my territory I think

Finally! This move should have been made like 80 turns ago.]
;W[pj];B[pk]C[Settling for two separate territories rather than one difficult to defend territory.

We have to assume that Q10 will probably live. Under this assumption, take a look at how devastating R10 will be to your territories.]
;W[ok];B[pl];W[qj]C[Here we go...];B[rl];W[ol]C[This move does nothing]

(;B[pm]C[No need to react really. See Var]
(;W[nl];B[ap]C[I've been know to be stubborn.

I can see that...];W[bo];B[bn];W[aq];B[an];W[br];B[dq]C[Yeah...]
;W[cq];B[dr];W[cr];B[fq]C[I realized I was being stubborn and decided to just make a better position and forcing him to decrease his territory by moving here.]
;W[er];B[fp];W[fr];B[dh]C[Finally took the split because I could. Even though it doesn't really split.

Your threat took 98 turns to become actually threatening...
Still, right now this is a good move.];W[dg]C[Pwned.

Still this exchange created two cutting points, weaknesses which might be exploited later on.]
;B[ci]C[Making a territory.

This move is good at this point.];W[cg]C[He takes a stone to close a cutting point. D12 paid off just now.]
;B[rj]C[Decided that I like the idea of connecting my groups.

Not that bad a move, but the idea behind it is wrong. Connecting groups that are alive is not needed in itself. Defending your territory should be your goal here.]
;W[ri]C[Fail.];B[sj]C[Probably better at S9];W[qi]
(;B[rk]C[Making sure he/she doesn't come in.

Not needed, see Var. If you worry about this, better play T10 here.]

(;W[oi]C[Probably not needed. Correctly reading situations like this is pretty hard at your (and mine too) level.]
;B[qh]C[Good.];W[oh];B[og];W[ng]
(;B[jf]C[Trying to exert central influence, I was also considering the center, which probably would've been better with the support of the bottom and left groups of mine.

See variation.];W[jj]C[Nevermind!];B[gj]C[Settled for that instead, wishing I took the center.

Good move.];W[gh]C[He is forcing you to solidify your territory below and invites you to attack K10.]
;B[ik]C[...which you promptly do.];W[ij];B[hk];W[kl];B[jm];W[of]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[og];B[pe]
(;W[rh]C[Wrong! See variation.];B[rg]C[Large move now.];W[pi]
C[Does nothing. R14 is not a weakness.];B[ne];W[me];B[mf]C[Trying to kill that group, and I think I would've succeded if I hadn't made the mistake coming up.]
;W[lf];B[nf];W[lg];B[le]C[Here is your mistake i think. Without reading the situation, you can observe that this stone is weak and invites attack.

You are trying too hard here. You want to kill his stones. In situations like this, take your time and take a step back to look at the big picture. Can you still kill these stones? What if you don't, can that cost you the game? What will be the cost of failing to kill?]
;W[ld]
(;B[ke];W[kd]
(;B[kc]C[Here.  I was afraid of him infiltraing my territory, which I wouldn't have worried about if I hadn't thought that he/she was pretty much dead.  Boy was I wrong,  I should've moved here.]
;W[je]C[And I lose.  A big loss.

Still you don't accept your loss here. Maybe try to get some profit from your stones by threatening to connect them, while in truth aiming for outside territory. Dead stones can often be put to use.]

(;B[kf];W[ie]C[Because now my four pieces are dead and that group is alive.  *sad face*

His group has been alive for some time now. The bigger issue is him getting as far as J15, which schould have been your territory.]
;B[jd];W[if];B[ih]C[Thought I could maybe save my pieces.

No! Accept your mistake and move on!
This is a thoroughly emotional move. His response is obvious. Try to stay calm and rational all the time.]
;W[jg]C[Nope.];B[hi]C[So I decide to try and split his pieces for whatever reason.

This move is actually good. Splitting his groups is not an issue here since both are alive, but keeping J12 alive is good as it is a thorn in his territory.]
;W[jh];B[gi];W[hh];B[ii];W[ji]C[This exchange was ok and sente.]
;B[fi]C[good];W[fh];B[gd]C[good];W[ge];B[bi]C[Now I'm just basically going around and solidifying my territories, because I don't see any better way to assault his groups.

Good again. The endgame has started and you are making the correct moves. All are big and sente.]
;W[bh]
(;B[ah]C[I do this move because it seems to me that it gives them one less territory despite losing the initiative.

Rather look for some other sente move first. See var];W[ag]
;B[ai];W[mg]C[This isnt even a single point];B[hd];W[id];B[ic]
;W[od]C[Again, a zero-point-move, and thus very suspicious. A very common weakness at your level of play is overlooking bit threats in the endgame. Lots of small moves are played, and the way some of your groups are getting low on liberties will slip your attention. Trust me, this happened A LOT to me too.

In the endgame, always take your time and assess every move your opponents make for one thing: Which of my groups lose liberties. How does that endanger them.

I believe the problem here is that you suddenly have to care about the safety of groups that were totally safe for the last 50, 100 or 150 turns.]
;B[he];W[sg]C[This is the beginning of my second big mistake that cost the game.  I didn't realize how much danger that group was in.

Ouch!
Feel the pain. Try to remember it next game, when you are feeling relaxed in the endgame.]

(;B[sf];W[qf]C[With this move.  Great sequence by oknzc. Not sure what I could've done better without seeing how much danger I was in and choosing to waste initiative in solidfying my position earlier.  Something I'm trying to learn through experience, when I should be worried and when I shouldn't.]

;B[hf]C[Forcing him to make a move so I can move my chain into his territory to support my forthcoming attack.]
;W[ig];B[hg]C[Splitting his groups so that I have a better chance in my attack.]
;W[ff]C[Good move by him to make me feel like an idiot, but I try anyways.  My logic is that as long as every move I make in his territory is answered, the score is even because even though I lose a piece because it's "dead", he loses one territory because he moved in there.  Thus, if there is no loss or gain in me moving in there (unless he ignores me, but I make it where he can't), I figure it's worth the possibility of capturing the corner.

Yeah. Just try some stuff here. In order to still win this, you would have to find a weakness and capture a large group of his, so you got nothing to lose by throwing in some stones.]
;B[ee]C[So it begins.];W[fe];B[df]C[I guess I'm not good at this.  I'm not even sure if it was possible for me to take the corner but I figured I'd try.

(;B[bf];W[bg];B[ce]C[Each threat forces him to respond, hopefully one will succeed.  I probably should've planned further in advance, but there was just so many possibilities that I figured I needed more experience to really be able to do that well.  Experience starts here.]

Your reasoning is right. Just be careful not to miss the point where you are wasting your opponent's time. In this game i do not see a problem though, so don't worry.]
;B[ej]C[jemwest [16k?\]: at least that's my logic behind it, perhaps faulty and if so I apologize]
;W[hj];B[gk];W[gg];B[jk]C[Giving him one less point of territory.]
;W[kk];B[re]C[oknzc [15k\]: sorry my english is poor :)

Another possibly faulty logic.  Forcing him to move in his own territory gives him one point less, but I'm not decreasing my territory, so one point for me!

gg.  Like I said, two major mistakes I saw was the upper right corner: letting him escape, and losing my group giving him a huge amount of points in territories and captures/prisoners.  Thank you so much for your time and your help!!


In the upper right corner you wanted too much. You should have settled on one of two moderate goals: either take the corner and let him escape into the middle, or (better imo) let him live small in the corner and make good use of your outward influence. Taking the corner AND trying to kill him was just too much to ask for. It is a usual beginner's mistake to focus too much on killing.

On your overall style of play, i have four advice for you:
1. Focus more on finding the bigger play. A move may seem natural and necessary on one part of the board, but there may be a much bigger one around. Don't get nervous when your opponent seems to take the upper hand locally, when at the same time you make bigger profit elsewhere. React less. Act more.
2. Don't hesitate to sacrifice stones. Always remember, the stone itself is only 1 point. A stones worth stems from the role it plays on the board, not from this single point your opponent might get. Even if you can easily save a stone, ask yourself whether it is worth it, and whether your opponent should even bother to capture your stone if he could.
3. Accept your mistakes. If your plans go awry, change them.
4. Make it a habit to always check EVERY SINGLE endgame move for the liberties it takes away. This will only take a few seconds each, while it will win you games. Be especially wary of forcing moves that might open up to your opponent.]
