;B[cf];W[df];B[ec]LB[bf:A][bc:B][cb:C][be:D][bg:E][ef:F][dg:G]C[This move is not joseki as far as I know. There is a risk here that  Black forces White to play a stone White want to play anyway. Black 'a' is normal. The joseki that follow is White 'b', B 'c', W  'd', B E17, We13, B 'f', and finally W 'g'.]
;W[db];B[bc]MA[cf][cg]C[This is often the best move in a pattern like this. It looks like this sequence is reverting into the small avalanche  joseki, but marked stones has been play too early compared to that  joseki. It is hard tell if this is bad or good since I am too weak to check all variations that are possible now.]
;W[ef]LB[fe:A][eb:B][bf:C]C[The vital point is 'a', perhaps white should play there.  White 'b' give White liberties and make Black 'c' temporarily impossible, but is dangerous because of a ladder that works for Black.
 But my comments can be trusted since there are too many variations  for me to handle.]
;B[fe];W[bf];B[eb]LB[ed:A][ff:B]C[It looks like Black got the profit here somehow - but there is bad aji that might be troublesome in a future fight such as the cut a  'a' and the push at 'b'. Still I think Black should be satisfied. (This comment was not a hindsight because of what happens in the
 end of this game but rather something one always has to be aware of  after a fight like this.)]

 dp 8k : is entering byo-yomi];B[pf];W[pc];B[oc]C[This is a dangerous move.  Either it lead too complications that may ruin Blacks moyo or Black will have to sacrifice this stone, thereby strengthening White inside the Black moyo.]
;W[od];B[qc];W[pb]LB[pe:A][qd:B][qe:C]C[White could consider playing atari at'a' Black captures, White play atari again at 'b' - Black connects and then White plays  'c'. cutting through Black on the right side.]
;B[qd];W[qb];B[rb];W[ob]C[This is satisfactory for White. The groups get fairly strong immediately without giving away anything to Black.]
;B[qj];W[jc]MA[ff][fe][ec][eb]C[Now it looks like White has  succeded to take the initiative in the game. The Black stones in the upper left are not so effective now.]

[bm:B]C[Black 'a'is common move in this shape. It is efficient because it also defend against a White move at 'b'.]
;W[dn];B[cr];W[dr];B[nn];W[lo];B[nf];W[oj]C[Too deep.];B[mj]C[This move is obvious.]
;W[mk];B[nj]LB[nk:A]C[Perhaps 'a' is an alternative severe way to fight.]
;W[nk];B[ok];W[ol]C[This move seems to help Black more than White.];B[pk]
;W[om];B[on];W[lj];B[lk]C[Tough move - shows fighting  spirit.];W[li];B
[mh];W[mm];B[kk]C[This might be a little heavy.];W[ji];B[ml]LB[nl:A]C[This is the kind of atari one should avoid. Black looses the option
 of playing 'a' which would capture two stones one way or the  other.];W
[nl];B[ll]C[This is an ugly move, that proves that the atari was bad idea to beginn with.]

LB[io:A]C[White 'a' has to be better.];B[il]LB[hm:A][jl:B][io:C]C[I think Black 'a' has more potential, then White has to  worry about Both Black 'b' and Black 'c'. Still it look difficult for Black to find a move that works here right now.]

[bl]LB[bm:A][ak:B][ah:C][ag:D][ch:E][bg:F][dh:G]C[This is a bad move. It is better to play 'a' since Black is forced to  play 'b' later. The Black would have some aji such as the sequence beginning with Black 'c' upto 'g'.]
;W[ah]C[Now this is sente locally for White this is perhaps not the right timing.]
;B[bm];W[ch]MA[ci][bi][ai][aj]C[This is a mistake. It is not sente. Black can ignore it since the marked stones are not worth much now.]
;B[ak]C[This is just an 8 point move.];W[fg];B[gg];W[eg];B[gh]LB[id:A]C
[Perhaps Black should play a ladder breaker at 'a' before connecting.];W
[gf];B[hf]C[Never play atari like this when the ladder do not work. Play a  ladder breaker or jump with your weak stones instead.]
;W[ge]C[
 dp 8k : has entered byo-yomi again];B[gd]LB[fd:A]C[Black has to play 'a'. This atari makes White stronger.]
;W[he];B[hd]LB[fd:A]C[Black 'a' is better. White get stronger and Black weaker for every unnecessary atari played.]
;W[ie];B[ej]C[Very bad. Black looses two liberties for no gain at all.]
;W[eh];B[mq]LB[ed:A][fd:B]MA[ge][ie][he]C[Now White can choose to capture at 'a' or 'b'. Black has look upon these ataris and promise himself to never play like that  again. The three White stones are now an iron bar through the center instead of the original weak stone, and Black has gained nothing from the moves that forced White to play them.]

A clever sequence, but the timing is perhaps not that good.];W[ed]C[Black collapse thanks to himself...]

 dp 8k : enough.  I am well mashed up in the centre  . I

magnus: Black played many atari's that was unnecessary in this game.  This is a common weak spot that many kyu players have but is not too difficult to get rid of. So my advice is: always ask yourself
 the following before playing an atari that do not capture anything.
- Is my stone more valuable than the stone my opponent have to play?
- Is it better to leave this atari leaving the other atari as aji?])
