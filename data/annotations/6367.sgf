;B[dp];W[pd]C[Hi, thanks for reviewing my game. (I was black.)

Hi ... hope I can make a contribution although I rarely play
the opening you did. I checked my opening tutor on Many Faces
and I couldn't find your opening .. so it looks like it is very
original!

I've looked through the game and I think that what will most
help black at the moment is for you to only attach to your opponents
stone when you need to .. either to live or for you to make him
heavy so you can attack him. You seem to often attach and not
realise that this helps your oponent];B[dd];W[pq];B[jj]C[This is an unusual place to play. It is unnecessarily passive.
Once white plays d10 or there abouts I dont see any advantage
for black ...];W[dj];B[po];W[oo];B[on];W[no]C[This is joseki but r3 is not .. it is too loose]

(;B[qq]C[This move was just sloppy reading. 

Yea if expoited will be problematice for black];W[pp];B[qo]
C[I think it was a wise decision to give up r3];W[qp];B[pm]
;W[kq]C[Whites move is not urgent and seems a bit slow to me]
;B[pf]C[I would play r14 but I don't think it is necessarily better ...
it seems like a good place to play for me];W[nd];B[pi]C[q11 stops white moving in ... but it would be foolish for white
to move in now as there are so many black stones];W[fc]
(;B[ec]C[e17 is not good... as a general rule only attach to an oponents
stone if you want to make your opponent heavy so you can attacke
him or attache if you are fighting for life. Here neither is
the case];W[id];B[df]C[I like d14 gives you the corner and makes l16 a possibility]
;W[cn]
(;B[dn]C[I think the same problem here.. by playing d6 you help your opponent.
He can now strengthen himself and get good shape];W[dm];B[en]
;W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[Same problem of attaching ... look at my variation as a possible
way it could go];W[fp];B[co];W[cq];B[dr];W[cm];B[bo];W[ch]MA[kd]
[lp][lc][hq]C[I think by this point, with pretty large bases on 3 sides, white
had pretty much won already, so I'm mostly interested in advice
on how not to let that happen!

Well I'm not sure I agree ... I'll mark on the board where white
is vulnerable. At all of these places black can make significant
inroads. I think black does the right thing by attaching here
.. it doesn't unecessariky help white];B[cg];W[ip];B[lc];W[mc]

(;B[ic]C[Again don't attach .. see variation];W[kc];B[qd];W[qc]

;B[jb];W[kb];B[ia];W[ld]MA[lm][ng]C[Black does well here but f16 is too slow ... f17 is not a problem
and looking at the board  The x's mark where it is better for
black to play];B[fd];W[nn];B[nm];W[mm];B[nl];W[ml];B[mk];W[kl]
;B[im];W[jn];B[gn];W[ng];B[nf];W[mf];B[oe]C[P 15 is mistake as white doesn't need to reply]
;W[od];B[og];W[nh];B[mg]C[n 13 is good you have to play here]
;W[mh];B[lg];W[lh];B[lf];W[me]
(;B[jg];W[kj];B[lk]C[I think this abortive attempt at cutting also did me more harm
than good. Can white be cut here? perhaps with m11? Would better
play be just to let white connect and try for some territory
in the centre?];W[kk];B[ll];W[lm];B[jm];W[km];B[ki];W[li];B[nj]

I'll stop comments now as white should win easily now. See my
comments at the beginining for general ideas on how to develop
your game]))

(;B[pf]C[Maybe this as an opening is more consistent with your decision
to play k10. K10 must be used for you to play a large moyo game
and after q14 you have a moyo. A moyo game means a fight will
develop so it is a good choice to take if you like fighting games.]
