C[Hi. My name is Biondy 11k in IGS and reviewing for black side.

you asked a nice thing. Looking for what you can improve. I'll try to help you improve your game.

eventhough you asked a review for black side, but I'll review some of white moves which may also improve your go.

Overall, your game was really passive. Stop playing your opponent game. Play your own game

I'll start my comment using B-];B[dd];W[pc];B[jd]TR[dp][qp]
[qe][qf]C[B- very unusual. Better to take one of the marked points.
Taking the second corner is bigger than this move. But it's ok anyway]
;W[mc]C[B- same here. better to take second corner or enclosing the corner.

Remember play in the third line is solid, but it can be pushed down.]
;B[dj];W[cp]
(;B[if]C[B- This move does nothing. Better to take the last corner. or if you want to play agressively, you can approach your opponent. 
This move doesn't secure anything.
see var];W[cc]C[W takes the 3-3 square below B at 4-4.  Read that once 3-3 is taken, no further play is needed to declare the corner.  I assume this means if B was not very strong in the immediate area - which it is not.  What could/should have been done here?

B- remember this, hoshi was played for taking influence, because hoshi is more influence orriented rather than moyo oriented. 

If your opponent play 3-3 and you have stone at 4-4, as a result you'll get strong wall, but lose the corner.

In this condition, your opponent rushed to play here.As white, I'll take the last corner here.]
;B[dc]C[B- Hmmm..... direction is one of my weakness, but I think you should block from the other side.]
;W[cd]
(;B[cb]C[B- wrong direction. see var];W[bb];B[db];W[ce];B[df]
C[B trying to get out in front to stop W  advance.  Good move?

B- not really. your mistake was blocking from the wrong side]
;W[cf];B[cg]C[B- hane here is not good. The result already shown by your opponent. I suggest tenuki here]
;W[de];B[ee];W[dg];B[ef];W[ch]
(;B[ci];W[dh];B[di];W[fh];B[fg]C[B- This do nothing. How about playing C7 or R4]
;W[ei];B[ej];W[fj];B[gh];W[gi];B[gg];W[hi];B[hh]C[B- wasted move.]
;W[ii];B[ig]TR[cm][qp]C[B- another wasted move. You have secured your territory here. Try to find big point on the board and play there. 

Remember this 'Your opponent big point is also your big point. Your opponent important point is your important point.']
;W[jb]
(;B[id]TR[ic]C[B- your last 3 moves do nothing. If you want to secure point here, play J17 (see var)]
;W[hb];B[hc];W[ib];B[gc];W[cl];B[ck]TR[el]C[B- how about playing E8?]
;W[bl];B[dl];W[dm];B[el];W[em];B[fm];W[eo]C[B- I don't understand this move. If I were white, I'll cut black. The cut at F8 is important point for both side.]
;B[gn];W[gp]
(;B[go]C[B- bad move. only strenghtening your opponent. Connecting is very important here, or play B9 to make eye.,]
;W[hp];B[ip]C[B- what does this move aim? It does nothing. Play the empty corner is big here (or play B9)]
;W[ho];B[in]C[B tried to setup net like defence with J6, but I think I later failed to stregthen the resulting border and ended up with broken groups.

B- yes. This is a bad move. Empty corner is the biggest point in the board now..]
;W[io];B[jo];W[hn];B[hm];W[fp];B[gm]C[B- I'll play F8 instead of this move]
;W[im];B[jn];W[il]
(;B[hk]C[B- F9 is the right move here.];W[ik];B[hl];W[fk];B[ek]
;W[fl];B[iq];W[bh]
(;B[bi]C[B- if your opponent play B10 here, you are die. As I said above, 'your opponent important point is your big point' B10 is important]

(;W[hq];B[bk];W[jp];B[kp];W[jq];B[kq];W[ir]C[Ya, didn't really see this coming.  It hind site, I think the two stones were doomed anyway so it would have been unwise to waste moves trying to defend them.  Correct?

B- yes. They are not really important.];B[ln]C[B tries to build out toward right edge.  I thought B had strong potential for a group in the upper left and a group that could be made live in the middle of the left side.  The small group (F7) is dead, but B stilll has good access to the empty areas on the right side.  I didn't expect a win at this point, but I didn't think things were that bad (apparently, I was wrong)

B- the fact is, white has 99.9% winning chance at this point . But winning is not important. To have fun and improving your game is way more important
Anyway, I prefer N5 rather than this move];W[pp];B[jm]TR[np]
C[B- This move do nothing. Better play O4. That secure your group here.]
;W[kk];B[kl];W[lk];B[ll];W[nq];B[mp];W[mq];B[ah]C[B attempt to enlarge the live group a bit before W has chance to play hane at A11 or A9 and shrink the group.  Also hoping for change to take away eye space from upper W group.  Looking back at it, pretty nieve to hope for any uppward gain with C13 in atari.

B- this move is sente, so this is a nice move];W[bg]
(;B[aj]C[B- no need to play this move. With A12 you make your group alive. How about playing the variation?]
;W[qe];B[nl];W[mk];B[om];W[nk]
(;B[ke]C[B- Wasted move. See var];W[ml];B[mm];W[ol];B[nm];W[pl]
;B[pm];W[ql];B[qm];W[rl];B[rm];W[ro];B[po];W[qp];B[op];W[oq]
;B[qo];W[np];B[no];W[kr];B[oo]C[B- M4 instead of this move]
;W[lp]C[Instead of chasing W to the right, B should have strengthened the lower border of the group.  Now there are two good cut points at N5 and L5.  What could I have done to defend better?

B- saving the two stones is bigger. Your mistake was connecting at P5]
;B[mo];W[ko];B[kn];W[lq];B[lo];W[qh];B[kh];W[nf];B[jl];W[jk]
;B[lf];W[me];B[mg];W[ng];B[mh];W[nh]
(;B[li]C[B- L17 is sente. play there.];W[mi];B[ki];W[lj];B[ji]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[ld];B[le];W[jj]C[I can see here that B is pretty well hemmed in, but I honestly thought it was just a case of strengthening the borders or our respective groups before both passing.  I thought of resigning, but didn't want to lose out on the learning opportunity.  Shelfish?  Rude?

B- well, resigning need courage, it is neither selfish nor rude]
;B[gb];W[ba];B[ca];W[ga];B[fa];W[ha];B[eg]C[B- play F18 first]
;W[eh];B[ag];W[af];B[al];W[bn];B[ai];W[am];B[ak]C[B-small];W[sm]
;B[rn];W[rp]
(;B[on]C[Eye space of odd numbers makes me nervous.  I thought that W could throw in here, willing to sacirfice some stones and destroy that eye.  B plays P6 to protect the eye (and group).  Was that needed, or did I waste a stone?

B-  eyespace of odd number may kill, but only when it is 3 spaces. Anway, what make you alive is two eyes and you had it (L7,M7 is first eye and N6-R6 is second eye), so this is only a wasted move and -1moku]
;W[sn];B[mf];W[jc];B[ic];W[fb]C[W cuts into B's group here.  I did not expect it, and didn't think the group was at risk (obviously wrong).  There had to be a better defense here that could have saved more/all of the group.  What should B have done?]

(;B[ea];W[eb];B[da];W[ed];B[fd];W[ec];B[fc];W[ih];B[jg]C[B- K12 gives +1moku]
;W[jh];B[kf]C[B- no need to. you are already alive];W[kj];B[lg]
C[I figured I had defended all the B groups as much as I could and had no chance of invading any W territory, so I resigned.

W up by 167.5 stones.  Pretty bad I guess, but I didn't feel like I played terribly.  Not knowing what rank huhud is and being very new myself, I can't tell if W was pretty good or B was really bad.  (note- I checked the next day, huhud (W) played 16 games that night, of which I was the first and is now ranked at 3k)]
;W[kp]C[mn355 [27k?\]: thanks for the game

Well, what I'll suggests you to do are:
1.learn life and death. you make 4 unneeded move at alived group (97,169,185,187)

2. Important/urge move
    There's a proverb say "Don't go fishing while     your house is burned" means play important     move first (make eyes to alive, killing your     opponent group, tesuji)

3. Big point. 
    Try to play big point. Find it and then play it.

4. Sente&gote
    Always play sente move before gote move.

5. Asking a review 
    Ask people who is stronger than you to review     your game or submit more of your game at GTL.
   also you may visit sensei library.
 
Well, if you have another question, just ask me. I also play in KGS. My screenname is Biondy, so if you want to, just ask me for a game.

I don't know if your opponent is a real 3k. I don't know whether he/she play his/her best. I think he/she is at the same level with me (looking from this game)

Anyway, keep on learning. I think you'll improve soon. You may ask me for another game review.

Well, have a nice day.])
