Dear reviewer,
it seems as though I've became weaker since I'm trying to get a feeling for the direction of play, but I know i have to absorb it...

Dear Dynamite,
I think it's really important for you to learn small techniques and play locally the best move later you can concentrate on whole board positions.
I hope this review helped you and if you're interested in getting another review you can also just send me the Sgf file.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[cn]LB[ed:B][cl:A]C[Would a pincer at A have been better?

NO your response is very calm but ok.
I think a response at b is also possible and more active but that's a matter of your playing style]
;W[fp];B[bp]LB[dj:A]C[A move at a would be better instead];W[cq]
;B[ck]TR[cd][cn]C[I think this is not so good for black because the marked stones are all on the third line and very ineffective]
;W[ed];B[ec]LB[hd:A][id:B]C[a pincer was very urgent now because he has strength in the bottom left and strength against strength is not very good. A move at a or b is good now]
;W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[cf];W[jd]C[This stone looks better if it's one line above because of the black stone on the star point there will no territory appear.]
;B[dh]TR[dc][ec][cd][cf][ck][cn][bp]C[THe last move looks overconcentrated the marked stones surround about 35 points but if white now play like in the variation he is clearly leading with about 10 points]

(;W[qj]C[Now a move at 017 or k3 is more important the area around r10 is very uninteresting now.]
;B[hq]C[i never know how to deal with that move, usually i build a wall ^^']
;W[hp]C[It'S better to pincer with l3 or l4];B[gq];W[gp];B[iq]
;W[mq];B[kq];W[qo]C[due to r5 the black group became settled, but i felt as though spending more moves at the bottom would be incorrect
Maybe theres a better substitute for n3? I thought about o3 but that would have given b a 2 space extension

o3 is too narrow but n3 is also invadeable for example at p3. 
I think you have to put more pressure on the black and attack with l3 or m3]
;B[nq]C[I think o3 is an overplay o4 is a very calm and good answer but p3 is dead]
;W[np];B[oq]
(;W[op];B[mr];W[pq];B[lq];W[mp]C[n4 big enough?];B[pr]C[now i felt like being in trouble. my lower left group could have easily become a floating one, my upper group wasnt too secure either and the margin of teritorry ive gotten is ridiculus
I played r14 but probably o17 would have been better, settling the upper group or is there an even better move?

The bottom left corner is almost secure and can't be attacked very well because there are too ways out and if white plays first also locally living o17 is a good move because it flows]

(;W[nj]C[this looks like ippoji, not very satisfying :'(

Yes white is now behind]
(;B[kc]C[this move looks strange it helps white to solidify his group]
;W[jc];B[kb];W[jb];B[he]LB[jf:A]C[MAybe a is a nice move but this situation is very very complicated]
;W[hc]C[The territory which white surounds is about 6 points and white is already behind he can't play submissive moves like this now]

I did not make any comments in the endgame because i think that the only way to play a good endgame is experience in actual games
I'm sorry that my English is sometimes very bad.
If there are any questions for example if you want to know how a fight will go on or you found another move which i didn'T comment on then please ask me on KGS (Terebi) or send me an e-mail.]
