;B[mn];W[on]C[This is white's first questionable move.  Rather than trying to kill the
weak black stone, he should threaten it and build strength. Q6 might be
a good move for white here.];B[pm];W[po];B[qm];W[rn];B[rm]C[This move is a mistake, P7 would be better.]

(;B[bg]C[This move causes you all sorts of problems.  The key move here is C12, as  white is about to prove.
(I find it a difficult discipline, but necessary, to consider more than
the no-brainer moves available to my opponent.)];W[ch];B[dh];W[bj];B[di]
C[After this move, the upper left corner is key for both players.];W[gi]
C[Therefore this move is a mistake.Consider the variation.]
(;B[ij];W[gh];B[gg];W[ag]C[because you played B13 rather than C12 before, this becomes a forcing move.]
;B[nh];W[dg];B[df];W[eg];B[fg];W[fh];B[ef];W[eh];B[ig]C[the upper left corner is still the best move (C17)]

;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[re];B[pq]C[I think the 3-3 here is better, threatening R5.]
;W[qq];B[op];W[oo];B[np];W[mp];B[lo]C[You do better attacking white by keeping the n3 group separated.  Just
giving up your 3 stones here is quite costly.  Just be sure to attack
white loosely, so you get a wall even if white lives.];W[no];B[mr];W[nr]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[lq];W[ms];B[qk]C[A proverb: when trying to live, play in contact with the opponents stones.
When trying to kill, play loosely without contacting your opponents stones.
(Although I don't think there is room to live here).];W[qj];B[rk];W[rj]
;B[ok];W[pk];B[oj];W[jf];B[lg]C[This move tries for more territory than you can reasonably get.
Playing M14 would separate the stones at K14 and probably kill them.
But I think I would make the capture at H12, removing defects of yours
and creating problems for white.];W[lf];B[jg]C[better to capture at J12]
;W[hh];B[ih]C[Empty triangles like this are usually bad, as this turned out to be.]
;W[mg];B[lh];W[ii];B[ji];W[kg];B[jh];W[kh];B[ki];W[kf];B[hk]C[Again, I would capture now.]
;W[id]C[This move is a nice threat.  If you had taken earlier at H12,
it wouldn't be.];B[ic]C[A better move would be to make a bamboo joint connection at H16.]
;W[ge];B[hd];W[he];B[ie];W[mh];B[li];W[mi];B[ni];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oe]
C[This is again a (costly) empty tringle.];W[ne];B[mf];W[me];B[ng];W[mf]
;B[nd];W[of];B[ld]C[better would be to protect the weakness at O18 by playing at O18.]
;W[nb];B[nc];W[oa];B[oc]C[You had a bamboo join, no need to connect now.  Better to play N18.]
;W[mb];B[lb]C[I think L18 is better.];W[kb]C[M19 might work as a response here; it gets tricky.]

(;B[kc];W[la];B[lc];W[jb];B[ib];W[fd];B[fc];W[ea];B[fa];W[da]C[This is a threat you shouldn't ignore.  Note that you still have C17 which will kill part of the corner.]
;B[jc];W[ga];B[ja]C[H19 would be better, or G18 or even F18.  Also, consider L19.]
;W[fb];B[gc]C[G18 would be better.];W[gb];B[hb];W[pa];B[cc]C[Good!];W[bc]
;B[be];W[bd];B[af];W[cb];B[ah]C[This move is not needed.  It gives up sente for one point.]
;W[bq];B[cq];W[ap];B[cr]C[You could afford the tighter B2 here, I think.]
;W[br];B[bs];W[ar];B[pi]C[Better to take at H11, I think.];W[qi];B[ai]C
[There are points worth more elsewhere on the board.];W[jr]C[This move is called a squeeze tesuji, and you should learn it.  It gets out
into your territory unless you can play down to the edge of the board safely.]
;B[jq]C[Better to connect at L3, threatening L1.];W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[ir]

capture a cutting stone without ever giving it a 2nd liberty.];W[bf];B[el]

;W[hl];B[il];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[Some general comments:


Walls of 3 or preferably 4 in length are much safer than walls of only length 2,
because they give you less trouble when they are cut.


The best defense is often an attack, especially when fighting off an invasion or

encroachment of your intended territory.  Try to threaten to cut off the attacking stones,
unless they can live even if cut off.

When you leave behind a cutting point or other weakness, try to catalog it
in your mind so that you realize what the opponent can do to capitalize on
your potential weaknesses.

Look for moves that allow you to make threats in two directions at once.]
