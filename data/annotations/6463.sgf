C[Hi Reviewer !

I'm Mishuu, 6k on KGS. I played this game against Bunshichi wich is 3k, without any handicap. I lost by 2.5 points, and I felt that I made some mistakes.
Thx for reviewing my game !

V:

Your major mistake is that you play too localy. You need to look at all your stones before you chose your moves. Otherwise, your position will cumble.

Also, I suggest you learn a few joseki (at 6k, you are ready for them). Try to understand how joseki lead to nice global positions, don't just learn them by heart.]

V:

This will lead to a flat position.];W[pl]C[V:

White's position doesn't have any weaknesses now.];B[kq]LB[qf:A]
C[Is the move at A better ?

V:

I think A is better. But it seems a bit slow. Normally when you play the 4-4 you are not in a rush to gain the corner.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[ce]LB[jc:A][cj:B]TR[qf]C[I didn't know wich move would be better for me next...

V:

A gives you a low position.

B is big.

You could also try a pincer against the marked stone (which also splits white's position).]

;B[pb];W[oc];B[ob];W[nd]TR[pl][qo]C[V:

White's thickness here is superior to Black's position. White has a nice position.

This is a hard game for Black since his position is flat. Try to avoid flat openings, they make the game easier for the opponent.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[pj]C[Is it a correct point to invade ?];W[nl]
;B[nj];W[iq]SQ[nj][pj][pn][op][fq][kq][pq]C[V:

With this move, white is planning a splitting attack.

You are very vulnedrable...];B[do]C[Before attacking the white stone, I wanted to put pressure on C4 to gain some influence.

V: Before attacking, you need to make sure your own stones are secure.

White's stones are secure, yours are not. It is White that is attacking.

Putting pressure here only gives white more territory.];W[dq]
;B[hp];W[jp];B[kp];W[jo];B[hn]TR[nl][jo]SQ[nj][pj]C[V:

You're position is split.

Normally, when you attack a group it's because you are looking to make profit from the attack.

Attacking white here gives you no profit. You cannot kill white with this position. You don't have thickness.

Once white connects his stones, your own stones will come under attack.]

;W[er];B[fr];W[li]C[V:

This position is incredibly painful for Black. You lost track of your stones.

Look at your global position. You have been cut everywhere.

Your bottom right group has been closed in, it is no longer efficient.

It is important to play globally and think of all your stones in order to prevent this type of position.]
;B[mk];W[lk];B[mi];W[lh];B[mh];W[lg]SQ[jo][jp][iq]C[V:

Even if you live, white gains an incredibly thick position. At this point, we can say that white has won.

It is because you attacked this group. The attack did not lead to a good result for you.

When you attack, it must be to gain profit. If you can't see where you will gain profit, then attacking is not a good idea.]

(;B[dj]LB[gk:A]C[I thought that a move at A would be too slow. So I played D10.

V:

I think you need to play more defensively. Don't let yourself carry weaknesses in the middle game.

It is crucial to defend all your weaknesses, otherwise all your plans will fall apart.]

You are lucky... White needs to play at A.

Maybe you can try this. It's sente and when you are thick you can play the kakari at A.]

(;B[eq]C[V:

I think this kakari is better. Study a few joseki to see how it can work well with your 2 stones on the right.

White might play a pincer.]))

If you want to put pressure on white, this makes more sense.

It's also an extension from Q16.

Try to learn a few joseki from this position.])

You can also play here. It's a very basic move but it's very effective.]
