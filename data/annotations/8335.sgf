;B[gg]C[quite a sensible start];W[cd];B[cf]C[I would have played G7, but nothing too wrong at this stage excpept you are inviting white to play G7 or b3 or d3 perhaps]
;W[ge]C[now where will you play - g7?
If anything, white's g5 stone is weak - g7 or e5 are good next moves.]
;B[gd]C[contact play is not ideal - you've given white something to push against - I suspect white wants to play f6 next and then he's got more liberties on each of his stones (3 each) compared with your 2 liberties]
;W[fd]C[the response as expected, now extend to G7,
playing at f5 would allow white to capture your stone and dominate a greater fraction of the board than you have.]
