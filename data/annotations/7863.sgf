AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, i'm Gianluca 7kyu from Italy and i will do the review for your game. 
I will concentrate on middle. Plese free to ask if you have any question about my review.]
;W[oq];B[cc]C[I feel C17 play against your hoshi at D4 and Q16. A white reply at D16 would press you too low. See one possile variation.
Maybe D16 or D17/C16 seem to be more promising.]

(;B[oc]C[P17 helps white, better to play elsewhere, like R17 if you wants the corner or Q14 or R14 to look for the side.]

[mc][nc]C[This whole sequence ended with me losing my two stones, and thus being unable to capture white, should I have went a different direction, or was there a way I could have pulled off the attack.

As i said earlier Q18 it's hard to kill, better to play elsevere]

;W[rd];B[re];W[lf]C[My opening has gotten better, at least I think it has.  My middle game is where I feel I need improvement.  I am ofter unsure on how and where to attack or defend, and I have doubts about my choice in the direction of play. I also have a nasty tendancy to lose sight of a group of stones that doesn't have eye shape, and they end up getting killed, costing me the game.  That did not happen this game, but I am curious if the possibility was there.

It's hard to say because it's your first game that i see, anyway keep in mind that a good opening it's hard to reach and involves many hours of study :-)]
;B[kf];W[lg];B[jc];W[jg];B[gq];W[cq]C[I wonder it there was a way for me to kill this san-san invasion?

;W[mn];B[qc]C[R6 is wrong at least S17, but defend your territory from N6 is more urgent, white start to reduce your influence and territory.]
;W[rc];B[qb];W[rb]
(;B[mk]C[Also N9 is wrong direction, there is no point in N9 direction, better M5]
;W[jq]C[White ignore N9 and goes for territory destruction, i think now we can consider N9 the losing move.]

(;B[gk]C[Submissive. I will end my comment here.
In the end i think N9 leads you to defeat, sometimes you played small moves ending in lose sente. O18-N19 is not very important, so don't be afraid.
I hope you enjoy the review, don't esitate to ask if you have some question about the game or the rieview.
