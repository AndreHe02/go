C[Hi!

I hope this commentary can be of some help for you :)];B[qd]
;W[dc];B[pq];W[oc];B[cp];W[po];B[ld];W[of];B[qg];W[id];B[mf]
;W[ph]LB[od:A][oe:B][qh:C]C[How can I punish this deviaton from joseki? Do I have to cut?

------------

Probably. Both A and B look interesting, but your move at C is not bad, either.]
;B[qh];W[pi];B[qj]C[Is this correct or should I push one time further?

------------

Correct :)];W[pd];B[qc];W[mh];B[kg]LB[jc:E][jd:D][je:C][ke:B]
[jf:A]C[The usual move would be A, but now W could cut at B.
Is this move any good?

---------------
As usual, the usual move is best :) After BA, WB, Black can push down at C and will achieve a good result.

Also, after A Black has a good continuation at D, but after the game move he is at a loss where to play in this area.

For White, its ok to play WE after BA.];W[qq]LB[ep:A]C[This should be a move in the lower left corner, say, at A.]
;B[qr];W[qp];B[mq]LB[or:A]C[A looks more promising to me?!]
;W[rr]LB[ip:C][jp:A][jq:B]C[Your next move at A isn't best, Black should play at B or C instead.]
;B[jp];W[eq]LB[dq:A][gq:B]C[Now, instead of your move at A, a move at B looks also possible (See Variation).]

(;B[dq];W[ep];B[dn];W[hq];B[iq]C[Better on k2?

---------

Yes :)];W[hp];B[de]LB[df:A]C[I wanted to play on A, but since I don't know the josekis from there, I didn't.

-------------------

?! If you think a move is right, play it regardless of any Josekis you know... But your move doesn't look wrong to me.]
;W[cg];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ef];W[di];B[fc];W[fb]C[W must play g17 (says joseki book).

---------------------

W must play G17 instead ;)];B[gc];W[hb];B[ic]LB[ck:A]C[I think Black should leave the top at it stands and play A first. If he can get a stone around B, J17 will work.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[jd];B[gb];W[ga];B[ib];W[ha];B[kc];W[gd];B[he]
;W[fd]LB[ge:A]C[A sacrifice to connect all black stones on top and eliminate all weaknes there.

----------------------

Bad - Black gets a good rersult now. White should play at A!!]
;B[hg]C[Must be on g14.

------------

Yes.];W[ff];B[fg];W[gf]LB[hg:A]C[Punishment for A.];B[hf];W[eg]
;B[dg];W[eh];B[ch];W[dh];B[gg];W[df];B[ee];W[ec]C[Maybe Black should resign here.]
;B[qm];W[or];B[pr]C[Mistake.];W[oq];B[og]C[Ok, Black has to try something here.]
;W[pg];B[pf];W[pe]LB[oe:B][nf:A]C[White forces Black to connect, which is bad. WA immediately is better - or WB.]
;B[qf];W[nf];B[nd];W[pc]C[? What kind of move is this :)];B[qb]
;W[me];B[lf];W[md]LB[ne:A]C[White should connect at A.];B[ng]
;W[mc]C[White must play n13. If he does, B won't get the large middle moyo, with which he won.

--------------------

Right!];B[mg];W[lb];B[kb];W[nb];B[in]C[Now Black has a chance :)]
;W[gn];B[gm];W[cl]C[W must invade the black moyo from the lower right corner.

-----------------

White tries to make territory from a strong position, which is nearly always bad.]
;B[nm];W[co];B[do];W[dp];B[bp];W[cq];B[dr];W[bq];B[bo];W[er]
;B[fn]C[Can W separate the stone on the left without giving them two eyes?

------------------

I don't think so.];W[hn]C[Bad shape!];B[hm];W[fm];B[fo];W[gp]
LB[ho:A]C[White just connects - WA is better.];B[fl];W[em];B[dm]
;W[el];B[dl];W[fk];B[ck];W[gl];B[il];W[ji]C[White is trying to hard here. He should have counted properly and played a resonable reduction then.]
;B[hj];W[jf];B[le];W[jg];B[ik];W[kh];B[ih];W[jh];B[li];W[lh]
;B[ni];W[mi];B[nj];W[lj];B[ml];W[ll];B[lm];W[kl];B[jk];W[km]
;B[ln];W[kj];B[jn]C[Is it necessary?

------------------

At least, it keeps things simple ;)];W[kd];B[lc];W[jb];B[jc]
;W[kf];B[lg];W[nh];B[oh];W[oi];B[oj];W[ke];B[ie];W[mj];B[mk]
C[Ok, that was it. An exiting game :)

Good luck with your next game!])
(;B[gq];W[cq]LB[eo:A]C[Better than A];B[bq];W[dp];B[co];W[cr]
;B[br];W[fo];B[de]C[The black position looks ok.]))
