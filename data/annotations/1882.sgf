C[Hopefully much of this makes sense.  I'm open for questioning on what I mean if it doesn't.    Andrew]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dq];W[dd];B[qn]
(;W[nq]C[This move is too close to strength this early.  All the joseki to do with 4,4 point stones are done with out the knights move extension and there is a reason for this.  Blacks best move is a pincer attack (see variation) that works fantastically for him with an extension at R6 already.  Be less forceful and come at a distance or ignore that corner and press the other corner.  There are some variations for white attached also.

"Here, I'm thinking I better not let him claim alot of   territory in the lower right corner, I know it isn't a   solid claim with 3,3 open but I still don't want him to   push in the other direction as well."]

(;B[np]C[Black should pincer here.  This allows White room to manuever.]

(;W[pr]C[This is a weak move.  O3 is under direct pressure and needs some direct support.  See the variation for white.

"I've never played this guy before, so I decided I   best push towards his territory to try to live rather   than try to push the other direction and give him a   nice wall towards the middle and me 2 rows of   territory"]
;B[oq];W[qq]C[Corner shmorner!  Corners are often over emphasized in lower rank play.  I myself am just training my self out of this at 5k.  Taking the corner at the expense of your outward development is not a fair trade!  The problem lies in the slack move at Q2.  Go back and see the variation I gave for the move.

"I'm willing to sac the stone on the outside to make   sure I don't give him the entire corner"]
;B[qp];W[rq];B[rp];W[nr];B[mq];W[mr]C[Now your fighting for a single line of territory.]
;B[lq]C[Rember in battles where this situation develops pressing from  1 line above the edge is good for the outside preson.   2 lines above the edge is equal for both
3 lines above is good the person underneath

The reasoning goes is the the outside person gets a wall with 2 lines of influence above it.  So its simple mathmatics from there.]
;W[or];B[pq]C[Pointless for black.  The cutting point at P4 can still be peeped (P5).  He should play elsewhere.]

(;W[co]C[The difference is subtle but d5 is better.  See variation

"I decide it's best to not push around any more and   play with giving him an even bigger wall"]
;B[do];W[cp];B[dm]C[Now he has the wall you were worried about.  Corners are important but not at the expense of bad play.]

(;W[cq]C[See variation.];B[cn];W[dp];B[ep];W[eo];B[fo]C[see variation for a good continuation.]

(;W[eq]C[Don't just allow black to get a pon-nuki on the outisde like that.  The strength he builds on the remains of his corner position works fantastically with the wall in the other corner.  He can use it against you on the upper side.]
;B[en];W[dr];B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[gr];B[hr]C[this move can be cut at H3.  H3 is the move he should play regardless in response to G2.]
;W[jd]C[The actual importance of the corners is driven home.    "now I see that even though I've gotten some guaranteed territory in each corner, I'm in some trouble with that wall he has, so I better start pushing towards make a strong side to push against the middle with"]
;B[gd]C[Black is pressing from the wrong side here.  If he came at you from D13 or 14 the new stone would work well with his strength at D6.]

(;W[mc]C[Ignore the invasion to make your stones on the right inefficient?  See variation

"ignoring the invasion to make some territory, looking at it now, I may have even considered the 4th row"]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[jb];W[kb];B[ib]
(;W[lc]C[Why?  See variation];B[ka]C[This should be ignored.  If black wants to waste his time on the lower edge let him.  You have better thing to do.]
;W[la]C[D13.  D13!];B[ja]C[Yes but...  D13 : )   D13 just gets better and better too.  Now black has a sizable, potential lifeless (ie not enough eyes),  group developed that D13 actually pressures in a big way.    "now I've given him a wall to work with, but I have a   decent claim on alot of territory"]
;W[fc];B[fd];W[ed]C[Don't strengthen strong stones, thats inefficient.  Strengthen weak stones like F17 with moves like E17.]
;B[ec];W[gc]C[

"here was a mistake, I wasn't counting liberties, had I been I would have noticed that it was too strong to think I would be able to kill his stones with that wall he had there"]
;B[eb];W[hd];B[hc]C[You've a ladder here.]
(;W[id]C[Don't give him life!];B[gb]
(;W[ge]C[This is pressuring form the wrong side.  The group on the right is strong so you should chase black toward it, not on to the two stones onthe the left.  See variation.]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[ee];W[ef];B[de];W[df]C[At this point this is reasonable but looking back I think its clear there was a less costly way to go about this.

"as my initial impression was to make a wall on this side against his wall to push at the middle, I decided it was best to forfeit some serious corner territoryto make a nice wall with"]
;B[ce];W[hf];B[cf];W[cg];B[bg];W[ch];B[bh];W[bi]C[This is a bad idea.  See variation for why.]

(;B[af];W[di]C[you sense the danger of black's cut and defend, but you loss sente (the initiative) to do so.  You lose games if you lose sente at the wrong time.]
;B[pj]C[Black is inefficient here.  He is too close to his big group of stones.  A more direct attack on the corner should be made at Q14.]

(;W[qh]C[Your wall is up not down play toward it, not in the other direction.  See variation.  I play this one out a few times to show some different ways to take black down.]
;B[oh];W[pf];B[nf];W[nd]C[Pointless.  the connection if firm at O16 already no need to play a stone there.]
;B[le];W[jf]C[Again, poinless.  No connections are being protected and no reasonable amount of territory is being protected either.  See variation for one thing that could be done.]

;W[iq];B[ip];W[ir];B[jq]
(;W[jr];B[kq];W[lr]C[This is due to concentrating on edge play too much from the beginning.  When you play behind corners as you have outer strength develops.  and it usually turns into large areas of territory.
