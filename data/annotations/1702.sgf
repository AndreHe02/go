C[Hi.  Lots of people have been telling me recently I play really well for 7k; but my rank isn't going up so I must be making some big mistakes.

This game was interesting because w won the game from the top which I never got the opportunity to contest so obviously I screwed up my fuseki/early midgame without even realising it.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[qk]LB[ed:a]C[Instead of the chinese fuseki black could have also played at [a\] as it would coordinate really well with the marked stone. Not that there is really anything wrong with your move.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[ic];B[cn]LB[fq:a][jp:b][cj:c]C[Why not the logical direction, and a move at [a\] instead? This would be a move working well with the (so far rather one dimensional)  moyo (territorial framework) on the right.

If one if afraid of hasami (a pincer) in answer to [a\], a move of [b\] is also good.


If you want to play on this side, it is better to make a splitting play like [c\].]
;W[cl];B[en];W[fq];B[dk];W[ck];B[dj];W[co]C[White decides to deviate from the joseki. This opens black new options.

The variations presented here are not the absolute truth, but rather ideas.]

(;B[cm]LB[bn:a]C[I wasn't sure about B6 or c7 here.  I think the joseki is B6 but I wanted to reduce w's liberties so they didn't surprise me -- not that that stopped them.

JL: It takes away liberties, yes, but also it potentially takes away liberties from the black stones as well. Also it is smaller than the descent of [a\] which would open up the corner quite a bit.

One more thing is that the descent of [a\] would also have attacked the eyespace of the two white stones more severely.]
;W[dl];B[el];W[cj];B[di];W[dm];B[dn]LB[bn:a]C[Would you not think that if the marked stone were at [a\] the white corner would be a lot thinner?]
;W[em]C[White seems to want to finnish the fight early with a knock out.]
;B[fm];W[ek]C[This cut is aji-keshi. White might have wanted to play the other cut instead in the future.]
;B[fl]LB[bn:a]C[Obviously F6 is a big weakness.  I decided white's weakness around d4 etc meant I could get away with F8 instead of F6.  Not to mention w is still short on liberties and must play B12 or similar

JL: At the moment white can not do aything with the cut but once his marked stones have escaped, you better protect the weakness. If the marked stone were at [a\] it would be easier to protect agaisnt the cut. Anyhow, if white cuts at some point, the fighting will be difficult for black.]
;W[ci]
(;B[fj]LB[dh:a][fn:b][bn:c]N[Mistake?]C[The white stone can not escape easily so this move is rather slow. Also now white has excellent  (and big) hane of [a\].

However, this move helps to protect the weakness of [b\] a lot simplifying the game, which is good.

Had black played the marked stone at [c\], [a\] would definately look better.]
;W[dh]
(;B[bo]N[Mistake]C[this was to strengthen F6

JL: This is a rather bad move as it is not only aji-keshi (erases potential), but also does not protect the cutting point properly (or at all actually). The variation at the previous node offers a different move. I can not really find anything good to say about this move.]
;W[bp]C[White is happy to enfore the corner. Black did not gain much. This exchange was very good for white. Black was basicly strenghtening white while adding another stone to already heavy group of stones.]

(;B[jp]C[This is a big point, but the cut at [a\] may now cause problems in the future as after the position changes outside, whitre may be ableto cut and kill the marked stones.

In practise black should have played a tighter move, or a move allowing black to sacrifice the marked stones.

If you look at the marked stones, you will notice that they have no real function left. Both white groups are stable around it so these stones are easy to sacrifice if needed (the sacrifice is rather big though).]
;W[eh]SQ[ic]LB[ec:a][cc:b][fn:c]C[was that a mistake? the top still looks invadeable to me at E17.  W does get a few forcing moves against D11 (or should I be sacrificing those 3?) which will help white's top.  I get the feeling I'm very slightly behind


JL:

As the stone marked with a square is low it is rather hard to make a living group in there by invading at [a\], especially because white is very thick because of the stone he played. If one wants to invade the top left, the move is [b\], however black may also want to redue the white moyo. One idea is to play like in the variation.

This white move is solid and makes white thick. It is also a bit slow. If white allowed black to play here it would flatten whites position and make him perhaps slightly overconcentrated on the top.

Territoriowise white is ahead - black has almost no cash so far. Also there is the troubling cut of [c\] left.

Sacrificing the marked stones is one idea as they server almost no purpuse now (make one eye). However black may get a rather thin position if he chooses that path.   How I see the position now is that white is leading, mostly because of the problematatic cut [c\].]

(;B[fi];W[fn]C[This cut seems unresonable and overly agressive right now as black is so strong above te cut. White should have left this cut as future aji.]
;B[fo];W[gn];B[go];W[hn];B[ho];W[in];B[ep];W[eq]
(;B[hq]C[I wasn't sure about this move - I had to do something and J5 seemed too simple.  H3 means I'm settled with some territory which means w is unlikely to attack directly


JL:
This is locally the best move. However this move was not absolutely needed so black probably should have first harassed the center white group first.


Now please look at the variation for tewari analysis.]
(;W[gk];B[fk];W[hj]LB[hl:a]C[I started to get worried here :-)

JL:

Black [a\] ruins the shape of the opponent while splitting him. However first black needs to get living room for his center group. There is nothing to worry about here locally. The only problem is that white may get some shape for his weak stones.]
;B[hi]C[Good. Even though this makes white stronger, it is absolutely necessary move.]
;W[ii];B[ij]LB[hh:a][hl:b]C[I thought the threat of seperating around H8 would be enough for w to let me out


JL:

Crosscut is usually used to make light shape when defending with the idea of sacrificing something, which is not feasible for black here - black needs another eye quickly. A simple extension of [a\] is better. Crosscut always strenghtens the opponent as well, and you are quickly losing all the potential for attack against the weak white center.

What is important here is to think what you really want to do in the game. If you like to attack the weak stones, you should settle yourself without making the opponent protect his weaknesses, ie. this cut and [b\].]
;W[ik];B[jj];W[hh];B[gi]C[This is awful shape for black.];W[ig]
;B[hl];W[hk];B[il];W[jk];B[jl];W[kk]LB[cc:a]C[well, it sort of worked.  Looking at it now the top is much harder to invade


JL:

If white adds just one stone in the top left, I can not imagine how black could win. Black MUST invade at [a\] as soon as possible.]
;B[km]LB[lm:a]C[I think one line higher wouldhave been better in this case as black is not really after a jump downwards here and a move one line higher would have slightly stronger effecton the white stones above and also now white has a future move of [a\].]
;W[po]C[I find situations like this tricky.  I've got to cause w to do minimal damage without accidentially bringing J6 back to life]
;B[qp]C[The usualy move here is [a\], but this may work better here as black does want to do everyhit possible to force white to run instead of allowing him to settle the group here and now.]
;W[op]LB[oq:a]C[Perhaps a bit heavy move and aji keshi as well. White might have wanted to play at [a\] some point later.]
;B[nq]LB[oq:a][mo:b]C[p3 bigger but I wanted to keep between P4 and J6

JL:

O3 is faster, but [a\] would have been better and more solid. Now white has quite a bit of aji left. Moves like [b\] or so can be nasty for black to handle now.]
;W[oq]C[Too early I am afraid.];B[or];W[pr]LB[nr:a][qq:b]C[I wondered about o2 but it make r5 too effective?

JL: Had you connected at o2 ([a\]), white would have captured the marked stone in a ladder by playing at [b\].]
;B[qr]C[The only possible move.];W[nr];B[ps];W[mp]C[Now it is clear that white pushed and cut prematurely.]

(;B[ko]LB[mr:a]N[Too soft]C[Black is a lot behind in territory and can not afford moves like this. [a\] was the only move and then if white tries to save the marked stones, black should try to kill it all to be able to win the game.]
;W[mr]N[Game over]
(;B[ec]N[Very bad move.]C[This invasion is not possible. There is no room for eyes on the side. The only possible invasion point is the 3-3 attachment at [a\].]
;W[dc];B[ed]C[A heavy move - all black can do is maximum of one eye.]
;W[df];B[gc];W[hb]C[hmmm :-(


JL: indeed :)];B[lc]N[Courageous]C[Brave move. This hasami (pincer) can not be played here. First white can atatck it severely, second, white can simply escape to the corner and win easily that way with no complications what so ever.]
;W[pc]C[White has no reason to play this tsuke as it can cause complications. Simply entering the corner would have quaranteed a big and easy victory.]
;B[le];W[hd]LB[ie:a]N[Bad shape]C[Ikken tobi of [a\] would have been better and bigger. Black is dead with no aji, so no reason to kill it even more :)]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[pb]C[Usually this move is not good as it gives the opponent good shape to the outside. But in this game black really has to do something huge now. And becaue of the marked black stones this actually seems like a good idea.]
;W[oc];B[rb]C[I wasn't sure about this, because of R16 but I read R16 is ok currently and I wanted to reduce w's eyespace]
;W[md]
(;B[qa]C[Considering the balance of territory black just can not play this move. Instead black should have connected. See variation of previous node.]
;W[ld]CR[pc]C[the beginning of the end...

JL:

Well, white blundered in this corner when he played the circled stone, giving you chance for counterplay, but now it is as hopeless as it was before whites mistake.]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[jd];W[jb];B[ji];W[ih];B[lj]N[Bad move]
C[Before playing this move you should have checked what happens when white pushes. Black will be in terrible shortage of liberties. Black should have played one line higher even. That would also be bigger and black needs everything he can get (and more) now.]
;W[kj];B[ki];W[li];B[lh]LB[jg:a][mi:b]C[K13 instead? I was worried about w L13 in response but I guess then I have M12.  Or B L12? sacrificing M10 is unfortunate


JL: This is locally the only move. If you had played at [a\], white would still probably played at [b\]. As it would be sente against the four black stones and also would make shape fr the weak white stones.]
;W[mi];B[kg];W[jg];B[kh];W[ll]LB[nk:a]C[I would have played at [a\] as white.]
;B[lm]LB[no:a][ng:b][mn:c]C[should be O13?

JL:   Well, first you should have played at [a\] earlier, and then O13 ([b\]), but killing those white stones seems impossible.

Locally the move you played is slow, and for example [c\] would have been better as you need to kill something big now.   In reality white has won the game a long time ago, and only very careless playing by white can save black now.]

JL: once the marked stnes were in place black could not break through unless white blundered badly.]

[ma:c][es:d]C[is this the biggest?  Nothing exciting after here


JL: No.




Playing at [a\] is bigger as it saves the stone makind the sente hane connection of [b\] possible as well as a monkey jump towards the top.

In the endgame one thing to look for in the game is miai-situations - for example the monkey jump you played and moneky jump of [c\] are just about equal in size and can therefor be left unplayed as if white blocks one, black can play the other and vice versa. Play the other endgame moves first, the "miai-moves" last.

Also notice that the monkey jump of [d\] is sente unlike the other two monkey jumps, so it is "a miai-move".]
;W[kr];B[js];W[ls];B[is]LB[ir:a]C[One line higher is better (white [a\] takes one point from black). No more comments after this other that the summary in the end.]

C[I think you should you (black) should try to play simpler and more solid game. Solid moves make it hard for the opponent to attack you and easier for you to attack him (and invade moyos). Also by trying to play simpler moves - as simple moves as possible - you give yourself more time to think about the proper direction of play (Kageyamas book Direction of Play is highly recommended - it is one of the best ever books on go), and also it is far easier to plan the strategy if your opponent can not cause complications.

Also you should study life and death problems - after some study you would notice how impossible your attempt to invade with E17 was. This will also improve your reading ability.

One more thing: do not play the chinese fuseki, or any other "standard" fuseki. If you play a fuseki that has been really well studied and you have not studied it, you are simply giving your opponent an edge if he has studied that particular fuseki. This is why I rarely play some openings that are popular among the professionals.

This game was very agressive. Try to play a few games with as little direct attacking as possible. The less tactical (hand to hand) agression there is in your games in average, the better. Strategy on the other hand should be agressive.


The last advice: Connect those stones! The larger your groups are, the stronger and safer they are (in general).

I hope this game analyzis helps you in your future go studies!]
