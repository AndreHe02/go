C[Hi,


My name is Peter.
I am coming from Germany and I played this game during a local 
tournament in Bonn.
I lost clearly because my opponent rendered my big dragon to one eye. 
There I have been in byoyomi and I resigned. As I replayed this, 
Irealized, that I were losing by 10 points already.
But I do not have a clear reason for this.
I hope you will enlighten my mind a little.

I picked up some questions and wrote down some of my thoughts during 
the game.


greetings from Germany
Peter

Hi peter ! Glad to help you ;) ( you switched black and white no ?)]

;B[kd];W[qc]C[Here I thought about blocking the other side with R16.
But the wall has some holes and it will be gote. So I decided to block 
at Q17.]
(;B[pc]C[Matthieu : I would block the other side too, having a wall facing Q10 is 
just perfect.];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]
(;B[fc]C[Matthieu : I am a patient player, I would just play o16
But your choice is not wrong, it's just a matter of style.]
;W[df];B[cl];W[ej];B[fe]C[Matthieu : This is a bit greedy, perhaps]
;W[db]
(;B[iq]C[I thought about F13 or D11. I didn' want to play E18 because I
 think there is some aji at C15, C17 and C12. But during the whole game
 the aji was never realized.

Matthieu : D11 : doesn't help black to get a better position. It just makes white 
stronger
F13 : is a very big move. You can play it.

Still, I would prefer to deny white at Q14];W[hc]
(;B[gd]C[I didn't want him to let him connect. But perhaps peeping with
 E17 and capping with H15 is better?

Matthieu : I don't think resisting is a good idea.];W[ie]

myself two move ago.];B[kc];W[ig];B[hi];W[ih]
(;B[fg]C[Matthieu : Bad move ! Why do you force white to fix  ?]
;W[eh];B[gj]C[I wasn't happy with this because the aji at D11 is gone.

Matthieu : And you used two moves for the same purpose !];W[lf]
;B[nd]C[Matthieu : Great success for white.];W[bp];B[jj]C[This seemed more 
urgent to me than the corner.

Matthieu : If you consider urgent, it means you think you can kill it ? But...]
(;W[cq];B[dp];W[bo];B[cn];W[em];B[el];W[fl]C[Matthieu : You lost tempo with k10. 
You have to try harder. The following is not sharp enough.]
(;B[ek];W[fk]C[My plan was to cut at G10 now but I feared the squeeze. 
(see vars)]
(;B[dm]C[So I played this one.];W[en];B[dn];W[fj]
(;B[nh]C[Matthieu : Still trying to kill ? As said before, it's really hard :( So 
black is playing dame and your move is not even sente. You need cash !]
(;W[ji];B[ki]C[Perhaps better at J10 but white gets only a false eye.]

you cannot kill white with two weak groups.]

with G8 and the big dragon would have had 2 clear eyes.];W[hl]
;B[im]C[Seems like you lost the game quite early to me. But that's because you tried to kill white's center too much. You should be more patient. Go is a game of points, after all. And killing is the hardest skill of the game. It requieres good preparation to kill a dragon. The best way to "prepare" is to make sure your groups are strong all around. Then " maybe" in the late midgame, you can attack it, but only " maybe".


Also, pay attention to the "ugly" moves, i mean by that : the moves that
1/ help your opponent more than they help you (  see move f13)
2/ try to resist at all costs, in bad shapes  ( see move o12 and the followings)


If you can stay calm, it will become obvious that some moves are better ( connecting at h12 simply - getting rid of the aji with o16 immediatly)  and so on. 
It's more of a psychological matter than a skill matter, I think. You may not be calm enough under the pressure of a tournament.Because, I am certain of that, you already have all what it takes to beat this guy. Just breathe, stay calm, and you'll get better ;)

I hope this review helped you, feel free to email me if you have some specific questions about the review.

(;B[me]C[Matthieu : Or he just pushes, but that's gote.

 invade on right side. 

All in all, my favourite is the peaceful variation, because it leaves 
no cutpoints.]))))
