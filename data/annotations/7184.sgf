C[LibraryEx [5k\]: hi
LibraryEx [5k\]: have a good game
moria31 [6k\]: hi gg
LibraryEx [5k\]: Hi, thanks for reviewing my game. Please review the game up to move 180. What I'm really interested in is the opening, the top right ko (from move 50 to 100), my dead white group at the bottom, and his dead black group at the right.
LibraryEx [5k\]: If you spot any mistakes after that, please also feel free to point it out, but please, there's no need to feel obliged to review every single move, no pressure =)
LibraryEx [5k\]: thanks once again!


Hello I'm Thomas your reviewer,
My comments will begin with [fantomas27\] as my kgs nickname is fantomas27. Feel free to mail me back if you have any question.
In this game, you were lucky that your oponent made a mistke that enabled to kill his group at the lower right. Otherwise, i think you would have lost the game.
In this game, you made mainly shape and reading mistakes. So my main advice for you is to study tsumego.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dp]
(;W[dd]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: would D17 or C16 be better? I was considering C17 san-san, but Sensei's Library said 3-3s in the opening are too slow.

[fantomas27\] : At this stage of the game, nearly everything is playable, sansan too.]
;B[qj]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: I didn't know how to handle this];W[fq]
LB[jd:A]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: Right/Wrong direction? would C6 be better?

[fantomas27\] : i would consider playing A first, to limit the expansion of the black moyo and at the same time enlarging white's one.
But of course, we can't say that your move move nor C6 are bad.]
;B[kq]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: weird pseudo-pincer

[fantomas27\] : i agree, it's too far to be efficient. It lacks severity]

(;W[iq]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: this move felt right, but somehow turned out all wrong later on.

[fantomas27\] : i agree, it feels right : it is a good extension for your f3 stone]
;B[nq];W[oq]
(;B[qm]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: I was expecting black O4, white R6, leaves him overconcentrated and lets me get a huge corner.

[fantomas27\] : as shown in the variation, o4 is not satisfactory for black, so he tried something else. 
But this r7 move is even worse];W[np]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: was this correct?

[fantomas27\] : this is simply the best move];B[mq]
(;W[cn]LB[fq:A]C[[fantomas27\] : Your A group is not very strong, so this double pincer might get you into troubles.]
;B[fp]C[[fantomas27\] : a good move];W[gp]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: This also felt correct, somehow ended badly

[fantomas27\] : There is no problem with this move]
(;B[eq]LB[fo:A]C[[fantomas27\] : good choice, black can't play A]

(;W[fr];B[fo]TR[dp][eq][fp]C[[fantomas27\] : here, black is toooo happy.
He just got a tiger mouth (triangled shape).];W[cj]
(;B[jc]TR[pc][qj][qm]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: how should I invade / reduce?

[fantomas27\] : all these stones are one the third line : this is too low.
First, you have no choice but to invade.
Second, I think your move was ok ; it is the way yo handled it that was wrong]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[qd]
(;W[oc]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: probably a stupid move, but I dint want to play the Q14 variation (see variation).

[fantomas27\] : this is indeed a bad move because there are too many cuts in white's position.]
;B[od]C[[fantomas27\] : black cuts and white position collapse]
;W[pd]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: self-reduction of liberties, but creates a cutting point at R17. Thoughout the entire line of play, I was aiming for outside influence.]
;B[oe];W[pf];B[qc];W[nc];B[me];W[ld]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: I sense trouble if black N16]
;B[md];W[mc]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: should black cut at M17? this was the trouble i anticipated.

[fantomas27\] : yes he should]
(;B[le]C[[fantomas27\] : this move is not ood because it create a bad shape for black]
;W[kd]C[[fantomas27\] : and here comes the elephant eye !];B[oh]

(;W[ph]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: bad move?
LibraryEx [5k\]: this was how it all began...

[fantomas27\] : q11 is better];B[oi]C[[fantomas27\] : now white group is doomed]
;W[og];B[ng];W[of];B[nf];W[rf];B[re];W[ri];B[rj];W[pi];B[pj]
C[[fantomas27\] : white has to fight a ko in order to live]
;W[rg]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: omg complicated...
LibraryEx [5k\]: this move took me 3 minutes, but I'm still not sure if its right, or if I should have played something else earlier on]
;B[qi];W[qh];B[si];W[sh];B[rh];W[nd];B[ne]LB[lc:A]C[[fantomas27\] : bad ko threat, there is now a cut at A. The ko is getting bigger...]
;W[ri];B[sj];W[sf];B[rh]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: i couldnt find a ko threat, so i tried aiming for an eye in the corner, or maybe kill his group
LibraryEx [5k\]: anyway, perhaps black could have let white live and kill the O17 group instead?
LibraryEx [5k\]: this felt like a disaster for white

[fantomas27\] : this is a disaster for white];W[se]
(;B[sg]C[[fantomas27\] : this move is wrong.
If black plays t16, his corner will be definitively alive while white's group is still a ko]
;W[sc];B[rb];W[sb];B[ob];W[nb];B[pa];W[ra]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: I was aiming for a thousand year ko (T19, T13)]
;B[qa];W[qb];B[sa];W[sh];B[ri];W[ra]
(;B[lc]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: wrong move for black?

[fantomas27\] : i think this is the best move for black because he can't kill white group anymore.]
;W[rc];B[mb];W[na];B[ma];W[lb];B[oa];W[kc]TR[ld][kd][lb]C[[fantomas27\] : when we look at the final result, it is ovious that white is at a loss here : black strenght is perfect while white got only 3 points in the corner.
Besides, white marked group remains weak and black has sente.]
;B[jd]C[[fantomas27\] : a bad move, it helps white to escape. Please, say "Thank you" to black :-)]

(;W[jb]C[[fantomas27\] : white missed the point here];B[ke]
;W[mc]C[[fantomas27\] : now black's influence is even stronger and white group remains very weak.]
;B[ib];W[ic];B[id];W[hc];B[hb];W[gc];B[gb];W[fc];B[fb]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: should white do O17 now?

[fantomas27\] : i think black should push as far as he can]
;W[eb]
(;B[nc]C[[fantomas27\] : wrong move];W[ga];B[ja];W[ka]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: It seemed like a flower-viewing ko for white, so I decided to do it
LibraryEx [5k\]: as it turned out, i couldnt find any ko threat at all

[fantomas27\] : this is not really a flower-viewing ko for white bacause if he wins this, he doesn't have any weakness left. Moreover it is very big (more than 25 points)]
;B[kb];W[dg]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: so i played a big move instead

[fantomas27\] : good];B[lc];W[ej];B[co];W[dn];B[go];W[hp];B[er]
;W[qo];B[mp];W[no];B[mo];W[mn]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: i was aiming to kill black, but killed myself in the process

[fantomas27\] : you can't kill black when the position is so much opened. You had been far too much violent here.
as a result, black lived and you died : this is a classical result of killing failure. That's why we usually don't try to kill. It is actually extremely rare (even if you see this often on the internet)]
;B[ln];W[ho]
(;B[hn]C[[fantomas27\] : the following black moves were very severe]
;W[in];B[im]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: this and the next few moves were unexpected]
;W[hm];B[gn];W[jm];B[jn]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: lol
LibraryEx [5k\]: especially this move. is it a tesuji?

[fantomas27\] : yes, this is a very nice tesuji];W[il];B[io]

;W[nr];B[js];W[gg];B[ig];W[hi];B[ji];W[lj];B[li];W[oj];B[nj]
C[[fantomas27\] : first black shouldn't play atari.
"when you can atari from two sides, don't atari" says the proverb.
That's probably what killed the black group];W[ok]C[LibraryEx [5k\]: is black really doomed? must he play P9 instead of O10? 'cause O10 will cost him quite a few points]
;B[pk]C[[fantomas27\] : something is sure : this move is wrong]
