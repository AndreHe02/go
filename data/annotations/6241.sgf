C[Hi, I'm Dieter Verhofstadt, 2-3d on KGS. My comments will be preceded by dv.

General comments:

- Although I'm not an advocate of focussing too much on joseki (root learning), you can surely learn something from doing so.
- The most interesting part of this game is the beginning sequence in the lower left.
- The sequence in the lower right gave an early disadvantage
- You have a good sense of global balance.
- You can improve by playing the hane more often instead of the straight stretch.

-------------
Hello,
in this game, I'm Eranorn (White).
I lost from 0,5 points, but I think I made many mistakes in the yose, and perhaps I should have kill the black invasion in the top left that made me lose a lot of points.
Finally, there was a 1 point ko... I lost it, and then, the game :)

I put a lot of questions in the game, I'll be happy if you can answer them.

Thanks a lot !

[dq:B]C[dv: This move deserves some comments.

1) It allows for a "hane at the head of two stones" (see senseis.xmp.net/?HaneAtTheHeadOfTwo) and therefore an alarm must go off: can this be really good?

2) But, as it happens, the move is possible, with many difficult variations. You'll find Kogo's joseki dictionary at http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm, where he elaborates on this joseki.

My comment is: if you want to keep things simple, the outside hane (at A) is often technically the best solution. Rarely is the outside hane a bad response to a supported contact play.

The inside hane (at B) leads to a standard joseki with many variations, so I refer to Kogo's for that one too.]
;B[dq]C[dv: Hane at the head. Usually very bad to allow this but due to it being in the corner and a backup stone at G3, it happens to be possible.]
;W[eq];B[eo]LB[bq:A]C[dv: As Kogo goes on to explain, this leads to either

- a disadvantageous fight for Black
- or White taking a big corner and Black outside thickness

See variation.]
(;W[er]C[White chooses the fight.];B[bp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn]LB[br:A]
C[dv: Surprisingly so, this is still joseki.]
(;B[bn]C[dv: But here, Black deviates from joseki and crawls one more time. This is bad. The theory behind crawling is:

- if you do not crawl and it allows for a sente move by the opponent next on the same spot, then you should crawl
- if you do not crawl and there is no sente move on the second line for the opponent next, then you should indeed omit the crawling

See variation.]
(;W[br]C[Was it the best thing to do ?

dv: No. See variation, combined with earlier variations.];B[cm]
C[dv: White has failed to extend and now suffers a couple of forcing moves.]
;W[dn]
(;B[bq]LB[em:A]C[dv: I think Black should sacrifice the corner now. See var.]
;W[dm];B[cl]C[I'm forced to push, right ?]
(;W[dl];B[lq]LB[ck:B][dk:C][go:A]C[dv: This is a lukewarm move. I would locally continue the ffight with A, B or even C.]

(;W[qq]LB[ck:C][gn:A][jq:B]C[The timing isn't good no ?

dv: I think White can catch the cutting stones at A. See var. That should be good enough. But the fight is very difficult. Therefore, it might be better to play at B or C]
;B[pq]
(;W[pr]LB[qp:A]C[dv: Now this is a big mistake. Rule of thumb: when you can choose between a move on the second line and one on the third, most of the time the one on the 3rd is better.]

[sr:5][rs:1]C[dv: You will agree that this result is very very bad for White. It is even not yet alive. There is a ko, starting at Black 1. Both players seem not to have been aware of this throughout the game.]
;W[ck];B[iq];W[go];B[bk];W[bj]C[dv: Very good! The double hane is strong.]
;B[cj];W[dk];B[bl];W[ci];B[jd]C[Ladder breaker.];W[qe]LB[dj:A]
C[Is it ok to approach here now ? What is the best ?

dv: Just catch the stone at A. Yes, Black will make a big moyo on the right, but you'll have free hands to reduce it.]
;B[qg];W[qc];B[pd];W[qd];B[qj]LB[pe:A]C[dv: Nonsensical move by Black.

1. The top right screams for A, enclosing White and connecting the Black stones.
2. The played move is way too close to the Black strength at the bottom.]
;W[gd]LB[pe:A][dj:B]C[dv: I would play at A. Immobilizing two Black stones and moving out of the corner. Or still capture the ladder.]
;B[dj];W[di];B[ej];W[ei];B[bi];W[bh];B[aj];W[fi];B[fj];W[jp]

C[dv Good moves];B[ri]CR[jf][ig][jg]LB[pb:B][if:A][pi:C]C[Where should I play at this point ?

dv: Yes, it is time to think about that. Clearly, a move at A would be huge for Black. White has big endgame at B and a forcing move at C. But where to play exactly to reduce? Let's count.

You have three corners, of value 35, 10, 3 respectively, and about 10 points at the bottom. That's about 65 points, including komi, but taking into account the big corner is not 100% safe.

Black has about 10 points at each side. So his centre must grow over 35 points

I really can't say what is best here, but I give a try in the var.]
