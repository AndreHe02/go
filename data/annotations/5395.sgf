C[Anything that you find to comment on would be appreciated, but I feel like I was the most uncertain in the middle game.  A lot of those moves feel like they lack a definite purpose, but I'm not sure what I should've done instead.

I've commented in a few places where I think I know what was wrong with my move and what I should've done instead, leaving the harder cases for the review.

Thanks for having a look at the game.

I'll mark my comments with "L".];B[pd]C[MssrBlanc [8k\]: hello

;B[ic];W[cj];B[cl];W[dl];B[ck];W[dk];B[bj]C[Is it reasonable for white to double hane here? I thought it would be worth the trade for a ponnuki, but wasn't sure if white can then capture black's two stones.

L: white could capture C8 if white double hane. See variation for that. However, white can continue to extend, therefore building a nice wall toward the center.]

(;W[jm]C[Would it have been better to omit 106 and try and split off the M11 group? At the time, I felt like a black play at K7 could cause trouble for an attempt to capture.

L: Yes, white should try to split off black's group. However,  capturing the group is very hard, if not possible. White should gain from the attack, ie, a chance to reduce the bottom territory, or by other means.]
