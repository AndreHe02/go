C[L: Hi,

Thanks in advance for the review. I won this game with 7,5 points or 1,5 points with komi, but it was the first game with a time setting of 1 hour for a long time, so I'm really intrested in every advice you can give.
I wrote some questions, but if you see something else which might be worth a comment, I would be very thankful to read it.

361 greetings,
Lacron

J: Hello, I'm Juuso, your reviewer. I'll preface all my comments with J:

My general advice to you would probably be to set settling weak groups as your top priority. Don't play elsewhere if your weak group can be attacked severely, just settle it instead.]
;B[qd];W[po];B[ec];W[ep];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[do]
(;B[bn]C[J: I think you could also play C6 instead of this. See variation.]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[dp];B[bp];W[cr];B[dm];W[jp]C[L: Is this a correct joseki ? K4 seems a little bit far away and later blacks position seems bad as well.

J: Well, K4 is probably a bit too far, yes. If you play D7, it's pretty urgent for you to extend on the left.]
(;B[cd]C[J: Probably better to protect the C9 weakness. See variation.]
;W[ci]
(;B[cg]C[J: You might even consider C9 here to protect your group instead. See variation.]
;W[cl]C[J: Annoying for black.];B[cm];W[bl];B[dl];W[dk];B[ek]
;W[dj]
(;B[ej]C[J: I probably would skip playing this. See variation.]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[bm];B[cn];W[eh];B[fl]C[L: I doesn't like the last moves of black, but I think I'm forced to play this way. Or is there any variation ?

J: There was certainly room for variation. :>];W[od]
(;B[mc]C[J: I would prefer a high pincer around M16 because E17 is low. This way black's top feels too low, but this might just be a stylistic choice. I think you could also just attach at P17 and play the normal joseki.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc]
(;B[re]C[J: You might want to play another joseki here, see variation.]
;W[ne];B[pg];W[ld];B[kc];W[lc];B[lb];W[md]C[J: Not very satisfying for black because the top has become really low. Black would also like to extend from Q13, but he doesn't really have time for it...]
(;B[jb]C[J: The usual joseki move instead of this is L16 and I think it makes more sense here. See variation.]
;W[qi];B[pq]C[J: Good timing.];W[qg];B[qf];W[rg]
(;B[np]C[J: Hmm, I would have just protected the top right group. White's group on the top is not alive yet, so I wouldn't want to give him easy life/connection by cutting at Q14. See variation.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[no];B[mo];W[nn];B[lp];W[pf];B[qb]
;W[pb];B[ra];W[hp]C[L: Was it correct to tennuki twice at the upper reght ? I thought the bottom right is bigger because ti destroys his framework. The fact he plays H4 is the result of a mistake at move 16 ?

J: Well, I do not think you have really destroyed the framework. White still has a sizable moyo on the right. I would have connected at P14 earlier to keep the pressure on white. H4 is a result of playing too far at K4, yes.]
;B[pj]C[L: I liked this invasion because his moyo feels bigthere, but I saw no way to capture me.

J: This looks like an interesting reduction.];W[pi]
(;B[oj]C[J: I would like to play lighter here, your group on the left is not alive, so playing heavy shapes like this can end quit e badly for you...]
;W[mn];B[ln];W[lm];B[mj];W[kn]
(;B[pm]C[L: Q7 really bigger than M5 ?

J: I would have connected at M5, since Q7 doesn't even really give you eyes on the right. White can still play stuff like S9 or R8 or something. This doesn't even attack white because M5 makes his group very strong.]
;W[lo];B[mp];W[rf];B[sb];W[qk];B[ol];W[ql]
(;B[qm]C[J: You're playing with fire here, your group on the right is not alive yet. See variation.]
(;W[fh];B[gi];W[gh];B[hi]C[L: Thought about H16 here. Which one would you play ?

J: Well, I think I like this more than H16, because the group on the right is far from alive yet. White can still attack the group on the right, though.]
;W[ic];B[hc];W[id];B[ib];W[gc];B[hd];W[fc];B[ed]
(;W[li]C[J: Hmm, odd way to attack.];B[lj];W[fe];B[ie];W[ge]

;B[hl];W[gk];B[gl];W[fj];B[ig];W[hh]
(;B[ih];W[ii]C[L: Forgot to count my own liberties here. (Thought J10 K11 F9 would work...) But somehow I felt satisfied because I connected my groups and G4 seems possible now. Is there another good way to play and save both groups ?

J: I think you could have got seki locally had you played J11 instead of J12. See variation.]
;B[gp]
(;W[gq]C[J: Kind of a weak move. See variation.];B[hq];W[go]
;B[ip];W[fp];B[jq];W[io];B[iq];W[kp];B[kq]C[L: Was this the strongest answer white had ? Or was G4/the crosscut a mistake ?

J: Well, black should not have been this successful.];W[jf]
;B[if];W[fk];B[el];W[ni];B[mi];W[mh];B[oi];W[oh];B[nj];W[nh]
(;B[br]C[L: I worried about my eyes here and wanted the possibility to play B1. Correct move ?

J: This is certainly a big move. B12 instead is also tempting...]
;W[bg];B[bf];W[bh];B[cf];W[km];B[kl];W[af];B[ae];W[ag];B[be]
;W[qe];B[rq]C[L: The top right group becomes really small, but I feel like I got more points from tennukis than he got.

J: Probably, yes.];W[rp];B[rr];W[pp];B[op];W[pn];B[qj];W[rj]
;B[dr]C[J: This is gote and not really that big. You might want to play something else instead like E18 or O17 or something. You might want to play C1 instead of this later anyway.]
;W[dq];B[cs];W[ml];B[mk]C[L: I think I should have played B1 immidiately.

J: Well, B1 is not really necessary...];W[nl]
(;B[bs]C[J: You can connect your stones. See variation.]
(;W[er]C[L: I thought he would play P9. (see variation) Which one is bigger ?

J: P9 for sure.];B[pl];W[ds];B[ke];W[lf];B[nb];W[nc];B[mb];W[eb]

;B[jc]C[L: Because it was a very close game I tried to play a good endgame. Any comments about it ?

J: I don't really have much to say. I don't think good endgame is something that can be taught, you just have to improve your reading and counting ablities to play a better endgame. :)]
