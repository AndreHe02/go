C[Although I won this game by 4.5 moku I have the feeling that I made a lot of mistakes that cost me many mokus, especially at the beginning of the game, even though I tried to avoid them. Could you show me how to correct them ?

I m aluin (black). There are already two variations because my hand slipped twice so I had to go back one move.

Note : I dont know any joseki so if you see some places where I should have used them please tell me.]
;B[qp];W[dd];B[dp];W[op]C[Interesting move. W is intending to fight from the very beginning.]

(;B[pn]C[Here I wanted to help R4 in the corner and claim a part of the right side.

Good plan. However, the fact that a stone placed on the 4th line has more influence toward the center rather than the side.

If you want to get territory on the right side, place it somewhere on the third line. (see variation 1)

Another alternative is to ignore the W stone and get the last corner. (see variation 2)]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[cn]
(;B[eq]C[This here is not a good move. For one thing, its too close to the D4 stone. Anything this stone can do, the stone at D4 can do also. (although maybe not as well)

Another point is that it does not help your stone at H3. A white stone at F4 would effectively separate your 2 groups.

The standard response to this move would be at F4 (see variations)]
;W[fp];B[mq]C[Here i wanted to attack P4 while protecting this corner and beginning to claim some territory in the bottom with the help of H3.

This is a good move. Note that you would be sacrificing the bottom left corner though.]
;W[jp];B[jq];W[jn]
(;B[mo]C[I wanted to kill P4 in order to gain the entire corner.

Good move, but for a different reason. Note that if white placed a stone at that exact same place, your entire bottom could be in trouble. Your group won't die but when you are fighting to make it live, W takes the chance to build up his shape towards the center. (see variation)]
;W[ql];B[qj]C[Note that the last corner is still there for the taking.]
;W[qh];B[oj];W[ol];B[qe];W[nc];B[pc]C[For the corner and to strengthen my position in order to attack R12 and connect my two groups.

This is a very good move.];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[qd]C[Minor point here

This move is a bit small. Since there is a stone at R15, you could place your stone one level higher at Q16 to get more territory.]
;W[ml];B[nn];W[rn];B[rp];W[rj];B[ri]C[To make a half bamboo because white has to protect.]
;W[rk];B[qi];W[oh];B[rh];W[mh];B[qg];W[ph];B[mj];W[lj];B[nj]
;W[pj];B[pi];W[pk];B[oi];W[ng]C[At this point of the game I had the feeling that I had more "real" territory but white had much more influence on the top left and the center.

That is correct. White's influence towards the center is tremendous, but influence does not mean territory. There is still much territory on the board to claim.]
;B[cl]C[So I played this.

OK this is playable. The biggest point on the board now should be at C14 though.]
;W[en]
(;B[cp]C[You're still worried about the corner? Compared to the rest of the board, that corner is small, considering you still have a long way to catch up to white at the center.

Play somewhere to reinforce your stone at C8. (see variation)]
;W[ci];B[bj];W[bi];B[cj];W[dj];B[bm]
(;W[dk]C[Whoa. Big mistake by white here. If white had cut you off at B6, you would have been in big trouble.]
;B[bn];W[bo];B[co];W[cm];B[ck];W[dl]C[I think that white played very poorly here because I thought he could have killed me.

Maybe not kill you, but give you a major headache. :-)];B[fc]

(;W[kb];B[je];W[ke];B[if];W[jf];B[ie]C[all this move were to gain influence, even if I had to give up some territory on the right.

You were lucky here. If white had not followed your lead and played at the center of the board, you would have been in trouble. (see variation at move 73)]
;W[jg];B[ig];W[ji];B[ff];W[df];B[eb];W[db];B[ea];W[fd];B[gc]
;W[gd];B[hd];W[ge];B[gf]C[How could I have done better here ?

I'm not sure if you could have done better. In fact, if white had played better, I'm not even sure you could have gotten a living group established.]

C[Here I wanted to go in his territory to make him lose mokus but I noticed afterwards that I could attack the F4 group so I did it.

If a move can be used for more than one purpose, it is usually a good move.]
;W[hn];B[go];W[fo];B[gn];W[gm];B[fn];W[fm]C[Is white giving the F4 group to me and stop me or is it just a mistake ?

From the way that white played, I don't think he had any idea that his group was dead.]

(;B[br]C[There my hand slipped it is obvious even for me that it s a stupid hand.

Actually, its an interesting move. I've continued the game for a few moves to see what could have occurred.]

C[This is the end of my review. Basically, this game is interesting as the fighting started very early in the game. Both players responded well to each other despite some mistakes by both parties which I have mentioned earlier.

If there are any more questions about the game, feel free to drop me an email.
