AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Abe: Hello reviewer! I played black in this game.

I'm curious about all my moves, really - what was reasonable?

I'm less interested in playing reserved moves to win a gentle handicap victory - I wanted to play the strongest moves I could.

There's a big reading error by me in the lower left - but I feel like I was on the right track there.  Was I being greedy, or was I just a move away from victory?


Jon:  Hi!  I'm Jon, your reviewer. I answered your question about the bottom left where it happened in the game, and also agree with not getting complacent. It's generally a lot more exciting than playing in a passive fashion.]

(;W[jq]LB[gn:2][go:1]C[Jon:  Extending here doesn't feel good with the 1-2 exchange in place.  He probably wanted to prevent you from turning at 1 and pressing down, but it makes this extension less attractive now.  Considering that he's expanding out, is there a better way to use the stones he's adding to the group?]
;B[dn];W[nq];B[qn];W[qf]
(;B[ph]TR[pj]C[Jon:  This is a redundant pincer, and won't give you much extra benefit with the marked stone already in place.  Can you find a more effective way to attack white's approach stone?]

LB[ld:A]C[Jon:  This move loses a lot of the momentum that was built up from the attack.  I would much rather keep it going by jumping out to A, since you'd rather have white invade the 3-3 point than try to shut your corner group in by playing A himself.]
;W[qe]C[Jon:  This exchange should be omitted - it just strengthens the corner unnecessarily.]
;B[qd];W[rf];B[sd]LB[rc:B][ld:A]C[Jon:  It's not really worth defending right now, given how small it is in comparison to the extension to A.  Also, defending in this way should be avoided here because of the aji it leaves (i.e. white B).  Connecting directly would be much safer.]

;W[gb];B[ec];W[dl];B[fk];W[ek]LB[fl:A]C[Jon:  This exchange should also be omitted.  If white's planning to play at A, he should just play at A directly and leave this part of the area untouched to keep his options open.]

;B[hk]LB[gm:A]C[Jon:  Connecting's a bit timid - you can safely cut (A) without fear.]
;W[hn];B[em];W[el];B[gm];W[dm];B[en];W[bo];B[bm]LB[cm:A]C[Jon:  This is just too greedy, so I'd prefer to cut at A instead.]
;W[cm];B[bl];W[bn];B[bp];W[bq];B[ap];W[fm];B[fn]LB[ep:A]C[Jon:  It's hard to keep white separated, so I'd rather try to reinforce the corner (A), let white out and work on the framework you're building in the top left.]
;W[do];B[eo];W[ep];B[do];W[dr];B[lq]LB[kf:A]C[Jon:  The sequence from this move until move 98 is much smaller in comparison to building up the top left area.  If you play something like A, you're not only building up that framework, but also putting pressure on white's top right group.]

;W[kq];B[jo];W[lr];B[dk];W[eh];B[dg]C[Abe:  At this point, the game stopped.  I'm not sure whether D13 had merit, or how black's prospects look.  Thanks for any comments :D

Jon:  D-13 is a good way to annoy white, but the overall outlook is rough.  Losing the bottom left hurt a lot, and white is now trying to establish himself in one of your last major sources of points.  If the game continued, I wouldn't resign just yet, since you can try fighting this out first.

Thanks for reading!])
(;B[qe]C[Jon:  I like the diagonal attachment for denying white access to the corner and forcing him to work within a small area.]
