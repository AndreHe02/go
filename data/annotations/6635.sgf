;B[pd]C[hello!

Thankyou for taking the time to review this game, My rating has fallen by two stones so something bad must have crept into my playing somewhere, hoping to find it soon :p

I was black in this game, at the end I felt I lost more points than what I shoud have done, it was not often I had sente and did not mange to keep it when I did.

Scott,

> Hi, I hope my review will help you.
The beginings of my comments are markes with the sign ">"

DISCLAIMER
I don't know how to play go. I also studing it. My fuseki is suck, my end game isn't good, so all the comments should be treated only as my thoughts about the game]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[dd]
(;B[qj]C[> I would never play like this.
And I didn't find any examples that this kind of move is played by a stron player (ama or pro)
It's hard to say for me why. R4 and R10 seems low if consider them together, I don't know.

Usually one approaches the lower side. 

You could ask a question about this in sensei's forum.];W[op]

(;B[hc]LB[jc:A]C[here I was thinkig maybe q5 or q6 would be better, but I played this thinking white would have to respond

>Strange move. You don't get a base with it and you give the base for the white with the next move at A

Tenuki is possible but instead of q5 or q6 I would play p3]
