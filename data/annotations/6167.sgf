Reviewer : hi Zeydel !
In this game you commited some big mistakes, mainly about josekis and the fact that you create a weak group while you still have another weak group. Remember that having 2 weak groups often leads to defeat.
For improvement, i recommend you to learn some josekis and also to look all the go board before doing anything.
