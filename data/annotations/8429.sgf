Besucher [6k\]: and a good game];B[pd]C[I played b and this is one of my first games where I tried to play Sanren-sei fuseki. I lost this game and more than that I felt very much pushed around. So I'd be thankful for good advice to do it better next time!

> Summary :

* Opening

If you like moyo games, it's all the more important to make all your stones work together. In this game, the top left corner didn't quite work with the sanrensei stone. The groups ended up separated. Study Takemiya sensei's games ! :-)

My advice is look at the whole board and always make local results fit the big picture. Don't just play local moves for the sake of joseki. Chose a global direction and pick the moves for that purpose.

When you wonder which direction is best, you can ask the opponent with light moves.

* Shape

Since the spirit of moyo is to attack, you will gain from studying fighting shapes, it will help accomplish your strategy more efficiently. I recommend http://senseis.xmp.net/?ShapeUp

* Strategy

When behind, you need to take risks and avoid conservative moves. It's like playing White in a handicap game. Dare the opponent with some audacious plan. Fight and complicate. Being behind can be fun too !!]
