(;B[fe]C[This move is not normal. As white I would be quite happy because there are still alot of invasions around c14 area, also c9 is low so building up influence like this is probably the wrong idea.]
;W[hd];B[nd]C[I see you going for influence but also this high approach on q16 is unusal, it gives allot of territory to white.]

[fs][gs][hs][is][js][ks][ls]C[One thing to note about your general strategy is that low chinese is usually quite a territorial opening, using it to make a big moyo is not recommend because of low c9 stone. It is hard to play this large moyo style because you put all of your eggs in one basket, you make one bad move and the invasion lives and you lose everything. My advice, try to play more solidly, don't make lots of weak groups. Your oppenent was very submissive, until he invaded, my advice for him would be to take advantage of some of your over optimistic moves and create weak groups to attack.]
