C[Hi, this is a game i played as a 5K on IGS, i've made some stupid mistakes, but i think that my problems on the big picture cost me.. please give me some advice on my play. thx.]

;B[ec];W[cb];B[qi];W[pj]LB[qh:B][ri:A]C[Which is bigger, this white move, or A or B ?  I don't really know, but it's worth studying.  One thing that comes to mind is that if white plays A and black answers at B, then white can still play the circled stone.]
;B[pi]C[Now if white plays A, black can answer with a block, which he couldn't do if white played A right away.]
;W[oi];B[pg]C[What if black cuts right away ?  It looks promising.]
;W[qn];B[ri]LB[jc:A]C[If black is going to take gote, which is bigger , the played stone or A ?]
;W[hd]C[i think it was a mistake to invade the strong black surroundings.

This move looks ok to me since white is strong on the left.  The time to avoid this kind of move is in situations where when black runs to the center white is split into two weak groups.

But that is not the case here since white has a strong group on the left.

For black's point of view, he probably should have made a stablizing extension here as soon as white played the 2-2 point.]
;B[hc];W[ic];B[gc];W[id];B[ef];W[dg]LB[ee:C][fe:F][ef:A][dg:B]
[eg:D][dh:E]C[this exchange of A and B seems to give white profit without giving black much.


Also, what about white C instead of B ?  If black blocks at F, white can atari at D and if black answers, white can make lots of profit with E.]
;B[eg];W[nc]LB[mc:C][ef:A][eg:B]C[
Instead of A and B on left, how about if black had played C ?]
;B[oj]LB[qn:A]C[
This cut isn't as powerful now as before, since which has already played A so white can make a viable position here, and not worry about the single cut off stone.

Before, white would have been split into two groups.];W[ni]
;B[nj]LB[ok:A]C[black has 3 liberties.  I'm wondering, if black plays A instead, he has more liberties and will be attacking white more severely.]
;W[mj];B[mk];W[mi];B[lk];W[pl];B[ol];W[om];B[nl];W[op];B[pp]
LB[nq:A]C[Which is better, the played stone or A ?];W[oo];B[me]
LB[nq:A]C[
What about A instead of this move ?  GIves black profit and attacks white simultaneously.]
;W[ld];B[kf]C[already one of my pieces are in danger..];W[nf]
;B[mf];W[og];B[pf];W[ne];B[md];W[mc];B[nd];W[mg];B[oc]LB[nf:B]
[ki:A][nq:C]C[After blacks played stone, white still has to jump out such as to A, so how about playing A immediately, before B since it attacks black's middle stones.

Of course, white C is so huge too, since it both attacks black's corner and helps white's stones.]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[ji];B[ge]LB[nq:A]C[
A still seems bigger than this black move.];W[le];B[lf]C[
White is using up liberties without gaining anything.];W[ib]
C[
INstead of using up liberties how about playing this move immediately ?]
;B[lc]C[
If the liberty weren't used up, white could answer this attack more effectively.]
;W[lb];B[kc];W[kb];B[kd];W[ob];B[pb];W[nb]C[too bad white ended in gote here.  that costs points]
;B[hb]C[is this sente or is white already alive ?];W[mm];B[ma]
;W[la];B[jk];W[kj];B[kk];W[hi];B[dh];W[ch];B[ci];W[eh]LB[bh:B]
[di:A]C[
Wfich works better, this atari or atari at A, assuming white will play B next anyway ?]
;B[di];W[bh];B[bi];W[cg]LB[bf:A]C[
Maybe A is better for preventing what happened later in the game.]
;B[fh];W[hk]LB[gj:A]C[Maybe A instead for white avoids being cut.]
;B[ij];W[ii];B[hj];W[gj];B[gi];W[jj];B[ik];W[hg];B[hf]LB[jg:A]
C[
How does A work out for black instead of the circled stone ?]
;W[jg];B[lh]LB[lg:A]C[Which is better, A or the circled stone ? (by the way, when I ask these questions, I don't always have an answer !  It requires some reading.)]
;W[lg];B[ig];W[ih];B[if]LB[ie:B][kh:A]C[
If black plays A instead of where he played, and white captures and black ataris at B, what is the status of the white group ?]
;W[kh];B[hl]LB[cm:A][kn:B][nq:C]C[im at a pretty big disadvantage because of that careless move..

This black move looks small.  Sure, black wants to strengthen the middle group.  But this doesn't attack much.    If white answers at A for example, black doesn't get much.  

Maybe B instead, which strengthens black and prepares to attack the white stones on the right.  

Or maybe C  is even better because it makes profit for black and also starts to attack the white stones.]
;W[cn];B[fq]LB[nq:A]C[
I still like A better. If A and the played move both make profit for black, A looks better because besides making profit, it attacks white.

Notice if white plays A white is almost completely alive and black corner getting smaller.]
;W[hq];B[cq];W[dq];B[bp];W[cp];B[br];W[cr];B[bq];W[dr];B[bo]
LB[bn:A]C[
Is black A better than the played move ?];W[bn];B[bs]LB[co:A]
C[If the played move doesn't make 2 eyes, is A better for black ?  Not sure, it's worth studying.]
;W[ao];B[ap]LB[co:A]C[Again, if the played move only makes one eye, is A better for black ?]
;W[ar];B[co];W[do];B[an]LB[dn:A]C[
How about cutting at A instead of the played move ?  Not sure though...]

What's the status now ?   What if black fills ?];B[tt];W[tt]
C[the last move probably made all of my pieces weaker.. in the end it cost me the pieces on the right side.
thx for looking at my game, and do not hesitate to point out any further improvements on my openings, thx.]
