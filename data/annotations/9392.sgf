C[hello reviewer. thanks a lot for taking the time to review my game.

it was not a horrible game at all. but i had some questions about middlegame/opening strategy.
white developed a sort of moyo on the left and i was hoping to get some reduction/invasion advice from you.

[if:C][pl:D]C[cooper: is this the right idea? white ended up building a pretty large framework on the left/center after this invasion... maybe better for me to invade this corner later? ideas?
