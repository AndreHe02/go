C[J: Hi:
I played this game as White.
I have added some comments (and quite a lot of questions) preceded by "J:". My oponent comments are preceded by "Jck:".

My worst concern is about the middle game. I do not know what should be my plans then. I would be very grateful if you could help me about it.

Christian: The biggest slip in your middle game was the missed opportunity to attack the two weak black stones on the upper left. Besides that, the game was decided by the fight in the lower left - black missed many opportunities to capture white, and also white missed an opportunity to capture black. The semeai was not that hard to read out - maybe you should practise that, too.

Best wishes
Christian];B[dp];W[pc];B[pp];W[cd];B[pe];W[qg]C[J: B q4 and q15 are good according to "The direction of play". That is the reason why W pincers, in other case B's framework will influence the whole board.
Christian: Actually, the pincer is quite unusual in professional play. According to Go Games on Disk (GoGoD) this pincer has only been played 5 times. In over 90% of the games white plays R15 and takes the corner.]
;B[ne]C[J: Seems strange. Maybe p14.
Christian: Joseki moves are P14, R17 and Q13.]
(;W[mc]C[J: Does r15 connect?
Christian: I think R15 would be better than N17 (and would connect).]
;B[qc];W[qd];B[pd]
(;W[qb]C[Christian: The usual move (without the O15/N17 exchange) is R15, and I don't see why this shouldn't apply here.]
;B[rc];W[qe]C[J: W wants to play on both sides.
Christian: R15 looks dubios after the R18/S17 exchange.];B[qf]
C[Christian: This is the weak point in whites position. Without the R18/S17 exchange white could handle it easily ...]
;W[rf]
(;B[re]C[J: B's connection seems better.
Christian: I agree. This is disastrous!];W[pf];B[rd];W[qf];B[oc]
C[J: B lets the corner go, taking a position along the top.
Christian: I think black has misread the position and thinks he could capture white. If black had planned to give up the corner, he should have connected (and even then I would rather not give up the corner!)!]
;W[pb]
(;B[ob];W[rb];B[md]C[J: Necessary because of p16, p15, o16.
Christian: This result is very bad for black.];W[fc]C[Jck: I liked B's position at the time. Now I do not, W is thick at the right and n17 keeps aji. I should leran josekis
Christian: I would definitely agree to this :-)];B[jp];W[pj]
C[J: Small. W has forgotten the 4 B stones are dead.
Jck: Agreed
Christian: If white thought the black stones could win the semeai, he should have taken a liberty ... White must play either C10 or C6 according to personal taste. The right side is unimportant now.]
;B[nq]C[J: d10 is a bigger point.
Jck: black is afraid of an atack over 3 and further use of 18 20 16 and 6
Christian: What is this? You should not play san-ren-sei if you are so timid :-) I would definitely play C10 here. The left side is very important for both players!]
;W[dj]C[Jck: OUCH
Christian: Good!];B[jc]C[Christian: There is some aji, but there is no time to play there. If white plays C6 now, the game is as good as over!]
;W[cn]C[Christian: Good!];B[fp];W[bp];B[ch];W[cj]C[J: Is this the correct way to answer B's invasion?
Christian: I would play there, too. Since you can't expect to kill black, you should build strength and take some territory while attacking him.]
;B[df]C[Christian: This looks a bit strange. I would prefer either C14 or E12.]
;W[cq]C[Christian: Big, but not urgent. I would rather continue the attack at B14. Since white is also rather thin in the upper left corner, black might find a way to settle himself by attaching, so you should not wait!]
;B[dq]C[J: Small. If B was planning to answer here, then he should have answered to b4 in the first place. The exchange c3-d3 is pure profit for W.
Jck Agreed
Christian: Yes, black should also play in the upper left.];W[qn]
C[J: The middle game is about to begin. I always feel disoriented at this point. What should be W thinking about here? What is the way to take profit by attacking the 2 B stones?
Jck: B14 and taking away border based eyes to began the runing seems a good way. than chase from 26 to gain power to start using 8.
Christian: I agree, B14 looks like a good way to attack. The right is still unimportant! If black plays around R8, white can still invade at R3.]
;B[ql]C[J: W has the opportunity of creating a second B weak group. But he is scared of doing so. If W p6 then B p8, how would you coninue then?
Christian: White usually plays Q8 before invading at R3, but invading immediately should be ok, too. P6 would be bad - black is too strong here.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[or];B[oq]C[J: o2 is joseki. Normal would be o2, p3, p4, q3 (needed or else p1 kills) and B defends the cut at o4.
Christian: Yes, black should block at O2. I'm not sure if black really has to connect after Q3, though.]
;W[nr];B[mr];W[pq];B[oo]C[J: q6 would definitely kill r6. n4 (or n3) would defend both n3 and p4 cut. This seems like a half measure.
Christian: It is hard to judge where to connect in this position.]
;W[ol];B[pm]C[J: Is the p8-q7 exchange a nice way to get influece or is it simply aji-keshi?
Christian: Influence? The keima is not really thick, but Q7 eliminates the aji of R6. So I would rather call it aji-keshi :-)]
;W[en]C[J: Once the lower right corner is settled, the middle game is here. I really do not know what to do. What should be my plans now?
Christian: You seem to have another notion of middle game than I - I would say the middle game started with the black invasion at C12. E6 is at the border of white territoryand the black moyo, but since whites territory is rather narrow, it is not so urgent. B14 or another move in the upper left are still more important.]
;B[dd]C[Christian: I am not sure if this is the correct point or C17 or D17 - but this is definitely the right direction.]
;W[dc];B[cc]C[Christian: This seems to be an overplay. Just playing E16 and C15 would be fine.]
;W[cb];B[bc]
(;W[ed]C[Christian: This looks too mild - D15 seems to be better.]
;B[de];W[bb];B[bd]C[Christian: This result is very good for black. The two weak stones turned into 10 points of territory!]
;W[hq]C[J: h3 or h4? What is the usual developement in both cases?
Christian: Usually you play H3 if you want to live along the edge and H4 when you want to separate the black stones. The respective joseki are discussed in Attack and Defense by Ishida Akira and David Bozulich. I am not sure if H3 works at all in this position - the variation I tried ends with white being killed. H4 is easier.]

(;B[ho]C[Christian: Black should attach at H4.];W[fr];B[dr]
;W[jr]C[J: k3 seems better.
Christian: I am not sure. The position is very difficult.];B[kr]

;W[gs]
(;B[ko]C[Christian: This move is unnecessary. Black should just take a liberty at F3 and capture the white group.]
;W[fo]
(;B[eo]C[Christian: Black still has enough liberties for the simple way.]
;W[do];B[ep];W[fn]C[J: Good, if a semeai is going to take place, the it is better to connect solidly.
Jck: I´ve been thinking of this game position and believe than black at j1 would bedecisive
Christian: Since black can still an advantegous ko by playing at J1, white should rather take a liberty.]

(;B[co];W[bn];B[dn];W[dm];B[br];W[cr];B[cp]C[Christian: This way of playing is very dangerous - don't take your own liberties away when you can simply capture your enemies stones.]
;W[bq];B[bo];W[ao];B[ap]
(;W[bs]C[J: Looks like a mistake. Maybe a3 was better.
Christian: Yes, now white could have captured the black group.]

(;W[cl]C[J: Terrible misreading. This is not sente because W b8 will not be answered at a7 but at a8. W should have played b10 and fight the semeai.
Christian: I don't think you could win the semeai.]
(;B[bj]C[Christian: Again black misses an opportunity to capture white.]
;W[ds];B[hl];W[gj];B[fi];W[fj];B[gd]C[J: B should play the ko, B risks nothing in it.
Christian: Yes.];W[ij];B[kl];W[kj];B[es];W[er];B[eb]C[Christian: Argh, why doesn't black capture the ko?]

;B[ng];W[jg]C[J: Maybe k15 is better, but W was afraid of k13 and the W dragon comes under attack again.
Jck: K13 is fair for white and a play black shoud have played years before
Christian: The white group looks safe, but I don't see why K15 should be better.]

Christian: I disagree. Black's failing to capture the white group was much more important (and the disaster in the upper right, of course). Nevertheless, this move is bigger than N5.]
