C[Bryan:
This is one of my first games against a human on a 19x19 board. 
Previously all my experiece was against igowin.exe, 9x9.  The game was
played via a webpage and took 28 days to finish.  I concentrated on
building territory, while black shut me out from the center completely.]
;B[dp]C[My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.  The rest of my comments will be preceded by my name.]
;W[pq];B[qo];W[qp];B[po];W[qc]C[Ted:
I wouldn't play away from the bottom right-hand corner yet.  I think
it's better to play around O4, and let Black get a stable position by
playing something like R9, before going to another corner of the board.

Also,
playing on the 3-3 point is very much aimed at taking territory in the
corner.  This makes it much easier for Black to get control of the
center.  (3-3 works in 9x9 go simply because there's almost no
territory in the center to take, so you *have* to go for the corners.)]
;B[pd];W[pc]TR[pd][qd][po][qo]C[Ted:
I think R16 would be better here.  This move allows Black to get
parallel walls, which work better than perpendicular walls.]
;B[qe];W[dc];B[oq]C[Ted:
This is why I think you should have played in the O4 area instead of
R17.  Now you're going to get sealed into the corner.];W[or]
;B[pp]
(;W[qq]C[Bryan: perhaps playing on the second line here is better.

Ted:
I don't think so.  You have to stop Black from playing the double atari
at R3, *and* make certain you can get two eyes.  Other moves allow
Black to atari either the Q3 or R4 stones.  See some variations.]
;B[nq];W[od];B[oe];W[nd];B[pj];W[dj]C[Ted:
I think it would have been better for you to have approached the Black
corner stone by playing either C6 or F3.];B[cl];W[ck];B[dl]
;W[dq]C[Bryan: I realize now that this is not the best way to attack this stone.  Perhaps playing at F3?

Ted:
F3 is a reasonable choice, although it proabaly should have come before
you played at D10.  You might want to look at C3 here, too.]
;B[cq];W[eq];B[df];W[jq]TR[dq][eq]C[Ted:
I think this would have been better played around H3, making it more
difficult for Black to attack the two stones on the left.];B[jd]
;W[ce];B[hq];W[lq]C[Bryan: Perhaps I should have attacked his stone at H3 instead of playing here.

Ted: I don't think you have any really good choices here, but I'd look at either E4 or K5.]

;B[bq];W[gr];B[le];W[mo]C[Bryan:
I realize that I'm pretty well pressed to the side here, and so begin
to reach for the middle and try to carve out some territory.]
;B[nn];W[io];B[gn];W[dd];B[ed]
(;W[im];B[ej]C[Bryan: I think I needed to jump here before he got this stone down.

Ted:
Perhaps.  The problem is that Black still has the cut at C13 to
exploit.  It might have been better to play E14 instead of J7 on your
last move.  See the variation.];W[mn];B[mm];W[ne];B[of];W[lm]
;B[ml];W[me]TR[nd][me][ne]C[Ted:
There's a proverb that says, "The empty triangle is bad".  In this case
the empty triangle refers to the marked stones which surround the empty
point at N16.];B[lf];W[ll];B[lk];W[np];B[op];W[qd];B[pe];W[qj]

(;W[rn]C[Ted:
I think this move is a mistake.  S5 is better because it helps save the
group in the bottom right, and shouldn't keep you from getting two eyes
with the group above it.];B[ro];W[so];B[qn];W[sm]
(;B[kd]C[Ted: I think Black should have played at T4 here and given you a chance to make a mistake in the bottom right.]

(;W[ec]C[Bryan: I believe that not playing at q6 here hurt me.

Ted: The thing with capturing at Q6 is that you can't immediately play at P6 -- you will be putting your own stones in atari.

I've included a bunch of variations, and don't think White can get anything out of them.]

;B[mf];W[og];B[pg];W[nh];B[oh];W[sg]C[Bryan:
I thought about this move for a long time.  It seemed I was hopelessly
behind, and I decided to try to capture the stones in the upper right. 
I figured it would require playing here at T13, at R14, and connecting
the stone at P11 to the stone at O12.  I have some powerful Ko threats
in the lower left, but the plan proved to be too ambitious.

Ted:
I think simply filling in at O13 would have been better.  You have a
reasonable chance to reduce Black quite a bit in the center, although I
don't know if it's enough to win.];B[sh];W[oi];B[ng];W[ar];B[ao]

(;W[fb]C[Ted:
I think you may still have another ko threat at T14.  I've added a few
variations, but they're unclear.  I suppose it might be worth it to try
T14 instead of giving up with F18.];B[og];W[gc];B[fd];W[gb]
;B[hd];W[sf];B[rg];W[qf];B[se];W[sf];B[mh]C[Bryan: My plan failed, as I needed the N13 and o11 groups to live.  I prod around for a bit, then eventually resign.]
