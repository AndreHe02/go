C[Hello there, my name is Michael.  I'll be reviewing your game.  You seem to be much better than your opponent in this game.  I don't know what rank you are, I'm unsure if my 11kyu KGS will be sufficient but I'll do my best. :)

Feel free to reach out to me about any questions at my e-mail address, and let me know if my review isn't satisfactory, so I can get this assigned to a more appropriately ranked player.

You asked specifically for a review of move 137.  I'll take care of that first, and then pepper the rest of the game with random thoughts.  Feel free to jump ahead.

C[Chinese Low Opening.  I don't know how much you know about it, but in this opening you're seeking to build a large moyo and use your influence to push around the other player.  You don't do that in this game though.  From looking forward you mostly just creep through his defenses.  Normally, that would be disaster for black because white builds up influence to counter yours.  But it wasn't a big problem for you :)]
;W[jj];B[nd];W[ld];B[nf];W[ne];B[oe]C[By playing P15 instead of N15 you're taking the side.  Chinese opening says to take the middle and use moyo for massive damage, so you're actually working against your stones on this.]

I think I made a mistake at 137, what was I supposed to do?

Michael: 
Well, you've been getting very lucky and getting more than your fair share from this opponent.  You can't have everything.  I personally wouldn't have played 135 at the location it was played.  You don't need to protect that cut point and you really don't need to make life over there yet.  See the variation at 135 for a better line of play.

I'll stop my review at this point.  Some things I would recommend is paying more attention to the entire board.  I would recommend reading Elementary Series Go Volume 1 (The Opening) for some tips and things to watch out for.  I would also recommend reading the Sensei's Library page on the Chinese Opening (and subpages) to get more of an idea how this opening is supposed to work.

If you have any questions or corrections feel free to e-mail them to me.]
