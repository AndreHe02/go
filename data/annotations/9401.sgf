C[Hi, this game is one of those games where i did not understand how all my shapes are broken into pieces.]
;B[cd];W[dp];B[pc];W[pp]C[I started with two star points, usually i chose randomly if to go for star point or 3x4 point at e start of the game.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[dr]C[thats some joseki moves]
(;W[dk]C[I learned somewhere that 3x3 response is not so common anymore so i tried a bigger framework on expense of the corner. This seemed well with the star points opening.]
;B[co];W[do];B[cp]
(;W[dm]C[I decided to play safe, and aim for center influence.]
;B[dq];W[qe];B[qd];W[pe];B[pd]C[I don't have experience with this black response, i regarded it as a mistake or experiment, eventually it was a big complication for me not to respond to it immediately.

It maybe strenghten the corner, but its dont look good];W[ec]
C[Writitng these comments, e16 seems better with my other stones]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[dd]
(;W[id]C[I protected this time, according to the if two then three guideline.]
;B[qn];W[ql]C[This reponse seemed to be good with my two stones at q15 r15]
;B[on];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[rq];W[pi]C[The lower right group felt safe enough compared to r8]
;B[oe];W[of];B[nf];W[og];B[pl]
(;W[pk];B[ol];W[ne]C[I tried to complicate the top taking advantage of black jumping ahead to p8 , not knowing yet the strength of my opponent]
;B[qk]C[I expected this and had a response i thought reasonable]
;W[qj];B[qm];W[rl];B[rm];W[rk];B[gd]
(;W[he]C[I think this was the turning point in the game, or the first invasion of many more which all succeeded.]
;B[ee]
(;W[gc];B[fe]C[I still thought this is a safe shape at this point. Although i would have been happier to be on the outside]

(;W[fc];B[hc]
(;W[hd];B[hb]
(;W[gb];B[jc]C[Now i realised my surrounded shape is dead unless i come through later in the game, so i wanted to take advantage of the three stone at h16 and get the center top.]
;W[od];B[nb]
(;W[mf]C[i think theres some bigger points than taking that 1 stone]
;B[dh];W[ci];B[ch];W[kq]C[Writing now, perhaps i should have strengthened the top, maybe l15. But the bottom was the largest area and i still felt the top is fine for now]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[nq]C[It is these kind of invasions that black kept playing and i could not handle. I am used to hight kyu players maybe.]
;W[oq];B[lq]C[More complicated than my experience]
(;W[mr];B[lr];W[lp]C[I tried to break black up with the holes in his shape]
;B[kp]C[instatant take that stone woulb be much better]
(;W[lo];B[kr];W[jq];B[jr];W[jp];B[iq]
(;W[ip];B[hp];W[ho];B[gp]
(;W[hm];B[mo];W[nr];B[ko];W[jo];B[ln];W[go];B[jn]C[Now i already felt this shape has crumbled]
;W[io];B[fo];W[fm];B[fn];W[ep];B[in]
(;W[hn];B[fp];W[mj]C[Again i did not read all the weak points i leave behind and tried to get a large moyo - which is the kind of game i am used to play and normally works :)]
;B[en];W[dn];B[em]
(;W[fl];B[el];W[ek];B[dl];W[cl];B[fk]C[Now i only hoped to struggle a little longer, at least to admire the ability of black to do with me what he wants]
;W[gk];B[fj];W[ik];B[ck]C[And again.. My eye shape falling apart, or my ego..]
;W[bk];B[cj];W[dj];B[ei]

C[First sente in a long time];W[ge];B[fd];W[ig];B[lc];W[ic]
;B[ib];W[jd];B[kc];W[md];B[ih];W[jh];B[jg]C[Another cut i did not anticipate]
;W[hh];B[hg];W[ii];B[if];W[ih];B[gg];W[hf];B[ke]C[Black has help waiting where ever he wants]
