C[I'm told the weakest part of my game is the fuseki.  I'm sure I don't know, but please pay particular attention to the first 20 moves or so.

This game does seem to be an example of a weak fuseki. You pick a poor approach move and then neglect the resulting weakness until it is too late to do anything about it. Your subsequent play is good and gains back a lot of the lost ground.

One time I saw a book title: "Urgent point, big point".  Unfortunately, I don't think it is translated, but the message is clear enough. Urgent points are urgent. Play big points when there are no urgent plays. Your moves at K4 and Q18 are big points, but there was an urgent play that needed to be made instead of at least one of these moves.]

C[
This is an unorthodox placement for this move. A more standard move in the chinese fuseki would be at A. Your subsequent comments suggest that you are trying to avoid the standard line. That is OK, but I think that this move is bad compared to the move at A. A move at A would be dual pupose in trying to attack b's corner stone and perhaps aim at a position on the top with B or C or something similar. The game move does not acheive either of these. It is too far from b's corner stone to be as effective in attacking and it is too close to the center top stone to form other than a very cramped position.  A more distant approach move on the other side at D might be better because it can aim at working with your coner stone.]
;B[od];W[ne];B[oe];W[jp]LB[lc:A][nc:B]C[
This move acts like nothing urgent is happening in the upper right. If you play A or B or something similar, you will do some damage before you run to the center.]
;B[lc];W[oc]LB[ng:A][ke:B]C[
This just forces b to make a good move and doesn't help you at all. Run with something like A or B]
;B[pc];W[nc];B[og]TR[ne][nd][nc][oc]C[My idea with o16 was to break up the high chinese before it got outof control.  I'm basically pretty sure this weak little group doesn't do anything useful.  How might I have better used O16 ... er, ... to do something useful?

See my previous comments.
You are now going to have a harder time running into the center because b is ahead of you in both directions.]

(;B[cp]LB[dn:A][co:B]C[I guess I was going for the joseki in the variation.  Is that a bad choice?  Is black just being strange here?  Did white get an even trade for this strangeness?

No, yes, might have got better.
Your move at A is at least OK. I might have considered B because it probably would make black a little cramped, but I am not sure that your move isn't better. B's move is strange, but it works unless you punish him..]
;W[co];B[bo];W[do];B[cq]C[
An atari isn't always the right thing, but it bears thinking about here.
See alternate line.]

This isn't so bad. You are getting a nice wall to work with your other stones]

LB[kj:A]C[I have all this thickness, so I wish to cause one of those fights where black might live, but small ... and in the mean time, white builds up thickness to use to invade the group at the top?  Is this a bad plan?  Is L9 just crazy?  Is there a better plan that I'm not able to see?

Hmm. Your thoughts are good but I think that b's strength at the top is high so an invasion from outside backed by strength is less likely to succeed. You will want to invade low which you can do for sure at the 3-3 point. I am less sure that other invasions are possible. The game move will be real good if you kill black. A might be better, not sure though.]

So far this has worked pretty well. I would seriously think about playing A here and encouraging b to abandon 2 more stones.]
;W[jn];B[jm];W[in];B[im];W[hn];B[kj];W[jj]C[White (me) is frustrated here.  My plan with l9 was to pin black in, not get myself pinned in.  How did this get all turned around on me?  Either black knew what I was up to, or I just plain did it wrong...

I don't think things turned out that bad for you. You turned your big moyo into big territory and killed some b stones. If you really wanted it to work the other way, you would have had to play on the outside and let b live on the inside. You would have lost much of your territory and I don't think your strength on the outside would be compensation. You are behind in the game at this point, but it is mainly due to the problem in the upper right.]

C[I got in there afterall, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't the best way.

Yeah, both sides make moves that shouldn't work, but somehow b let you get away with it. That happens and you might as well take advantage of it.]
;B[fm];W[fn];B[en];W[eo];B[he]C[
I think you should have skipped your last moves to play here. This is what you were hoping for.]

(;W[cc]C[I also think this was a bad plan.  I wonder about c16, or about some tesuji I'm not aware of.  There msut be some way to get under that top group...

I am not sure. Your move is a sure thing. I explored an idea as an alternate.]

This is a mistake by b. If he made more you might have gotten life. See alternate for how he should play.]
;W[mb];B[kb];W[pb];B[qb];W[oa];B[nb]LB[lf:A]C[I would definitely have won the game if I lived in there.  It made me sad when he did this.  I suspect if I used my editor to review this fight I might find a way to live.    But was there something else to do with these poor stones?  Should I have run them out into the middle 10 or 30 moves ago?

They were presumed dead when b played A way back in the fuseki. You should have run out before then. You actually almost recovered from their loss during the rest of the game.]

It's not strong, but it's not the weakest part of my game either.  Well, I could be wrong obviously... but I think my fuseki is the real key to getting stronger.]
