C[Hi I'm Andrew. My rank is approximately 17 kyu. In this game I
was playing against the bot Many Faces of Go 18 kyu. I have
beaten this bot on a steady basis now, but only have the trial
version so I can't make it any stronger. I feel I did pretty well,
but there were some parts I feel I messed up big time on. Feel
free to point out anything on which I can improve. Thank you for
reviewing my game.];B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[eq]TR[ce][cn]MA[dj]
C[D10 would allow either of the triangle moves later. K4 isn't horrible, but it doesn't seem to be very assertive.]
;B[jp];W[lq]CR[pm]MA[nq]C[X or O would be decent responses. Moving at M4]
;B[lp]C[Was this a good response to white's invasion? I realize that there
are bigger points on the board like the sides, but I didn't want
white to pose a big threat.];W[kc];B[pj]C[Secure a nice big moyo (i THINK that's the term)

A moyo is a wall. I don't see this as a wall, yet. This is just early influence.]
;W[hp];B[ho]C[Again, you are defending what here? The center? Now you are beginning to build a moyo, and you do have influence in that direction, but D10 is huge still.]
;W[pm]C[See, white sees all your influence, but realizes that he has enough space to build something alive in there.]
;B[om]MA[qn]C[Again I know there are bigger points on the board, but I want to
keep the pressure on White.

R6 puts more pressure on white. If you go under him, you rob him of eye space. If you go on top of him like this, that is unlikely to kill his group, and you end up with a smallish territory in the middle, while he gets both sides, if he plays it right.]
;W[pn];B[oo]C[Was this a good response? I felt it help my stones a bit, while at
the same time adding a little pressure to White's two stones.]
;W[ce];B[dj]C[After C15, D10 is less powerful because you don't "fork" him on both corners. It's still a great move, though I might D9 at this point, that is a minor issue.]
;W[cl];B[dl]C[Again you go on top. All the points are by the edge, especially in the early game. There are Joseki where you do this, but at this point C13 would have been far superior.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[qh];B[ph]C[You need to break this habit of moving on top.]
;W[qi];B[pi]C[Looking back I'm unsure if I should have connected or just played
tenuki.];W[qj];B[qk];W[dh];B[eh];W[df];B[eg];W[fe];B[dg];W[cg]
;B[ch];W[di];B[ci];W[ei];B[fi];W[ej];B[ek]C[Here I realize that I have White trapped in a ladder, not sure why
white persists. I took the time to see if it could esacpe, and
figured out that it couldn't. So why not continue the ladder?]
;W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[fl];W[gk];B[hk];W[nd];B[gh]C[Here I decided to reinforce my stones that are all weakly
connected.

Why? You win the ladder. You read that correctly. Those stones are very strong. P17 would have been nice. or even C7 or C4]
;W[pf];B[pe]C[This does not reinforce your stones very much. P17 would have made a stronger corner. I would have to say this was a poor move even at 17 Kyu. Don't follow him around. Be your own man.]
;W[dn]C[See, now he's getting that corner. Could have been yours.]
;B[dm];W[cm];B[en];W[cn];B[eo]C[Should I have played this stone at D5 instead? Or somewhere
else?];W[gl]C[Here White again persists with the ladder. Not sure why.]
;B[gm];W[oe];B[oc];W[nc];B[ob];W[nb];B[na]C[This is a good move, but an end game move. You have more important things to do, like L3 Or H14]
;W[ma];B[oa];W[id];B[mb];W[la];B[lb];W[kb];B[ka];W[ja];B[la]
;W[lc];B[ma]C[Why not K18? This seems VERY defensive.];W[jb]
;B[dp]C[Great move! Would have been more effective earlier, but still good.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[cq];B[bq];W[bp];B[bo];W[ap];B[ao];W[mf];B[of]
C[I feel this wasn't a great move. Thoughts or comments?];W[nf]
;B[og];W[ip];B[od]C[Looking back, I'm unsure why I played here. I think this was a
wasted move and should have been played somewhere like J5
instead.];W[io];B[ne];W[jo];B[ko];W[kn];B[lo]C[M6 would have done the same thing and been more aesthetic in that it pushes towards the center.]
;W[ln];B[mn];W[mm];B[nm];W[ml];B[jn];W[in];B[jm];W[kl];B[im]
;W[hn];B[hm]C[Why not just capture at H8?];W[go];B[gn];W[fp]
;B[iq];W[hq];B[ir];W[hr];B[hs]C[Again, end game stuff.

Your game would improve substantially just by making the most important move you can find on the board, without regard to what his last move was.]
;W[gs];B[is];W[gr];B[pl]C[Decided to secure my right side. Should I have played somewhere
else?];W[mj];B[kk]C[Just a random thought. I am glad that White didn't attempt an
invasion at R3. Also I feel this move wasn't so great. What could have been better?]
;W[me];B[oe]C[Your little invasion there was too easily repulsed. If you had pressed it instead of going to H1, it might have been better in that you might have cut off O14]
;W[nl];B[ol]C[If  he cut there, what would be the down side?]
;W[cr];B[aq]C[Another premature end game move. He wasn't threatening to make those stones alive.]
;W[jl];B[il];W[jk];B[jj];W[kj];B[ik];W[lk];B[nk];W[ij];B[ji]
;W[ki]C[L3 is an important move, now or before even.];B[ii]
;W[jq];B[kp]C[Looking back I think this should have been played one spot lower
at L3.];W[mo];B[nn];W[mp];B[np];W[nq]C[This is where computers kick butt. Now we're getting into fighting skills, and the computer will always be better there. You built up weak shapes, closed triangles instead of open ones. And now you will pay.

But look at his huge territory in the upper left. That is going to be hard to overcome at this point. Especially with the pain you are having.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[mr];B[mq];W[kq];B[ms];W[nq];B[ns];W[os]
;B[mq];W[lr];B[nq];W[jr];B[ec]C[Thought I would attempt an invasion. Looking back I realize that
it was futile.

Correct. Though maybe an invasion at G17 would have been slightly more probable to succeed. Don't touch the enemy on the initial invasion if you can avoid it.]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[fc];B[ed];W[ee];B[db];W[dd]TR[cb][gb]C[Either triangled move would give you the opportunity to get one eye, the C18 gives you a fair shot at life.]
;B[ea];W[gc];B[eb]C[Why worry about the two stones? Worry about life. Think EYEs at this point!!! C17 would be great C18 would be fine too.]
;W[gb];B[ga];W[ha];B[fa]C[Ugly (and dead) black group. :( I guess I thought I could make some life to the left.

You could if you had moved over there. You gave away a liberty for the E18 group unnecessarily, making you even easier to kill.]
;W[ls];B[pr]C[What's he going to do? Bleed on you?];W[jh];B[hj]
;W[ih];B[hh];W[hg];B[ig];W[jg];B[if];W[jf];B[hf];W[gg];B[ff]
C[I feel this was a great move? Am I correct?];W[gf];B[ge];W[fd]
;B[fg]C[Looking back I believe this was a wasted stone that could have
been played elsewhere.

Yeah, you do that a lot. Don't defend until the last second if you can attack elsewhere and still defend successfully.]
;W[je];B[cc]C[Trying to make like, but with White's response I see that my group is dead and unable to be saved.]
;W[cb];B[bg];W[bc];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[be];B[mh];W[li];B[ni]
;W[nj];B[oj];W[lh];B[mg];W[lg];B[qg];W[rg];B[pg];W[rf];B[rk]
;W[rj]TR[re]C[S15 limits his space for eyes, requiring him to respond at T12 or die. He might die anyway.]
;B[rh];W[ri];B[sh];W[si];B[sj]C[I like how this sequence ended. :)

He didn't play well, IMHO.];W[hd];B[he];W[mk];B[ok];W[ag];B[ah]
;W[af];B[ck]C[Decided to secure my area over here in case white decided to do something with this group of stones.]
;W[ef];B[ep];W[gq];B[fo];W[mc];B[qn]C[This move begins a fight. I feel I handled it well. If there was anything that I could do better feel free to comment.]
;W[qo];B[po];W[qp];B[qq];W[qm];B[rm];W[rn];B[rl];W[br];B[rp]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[ar];B[bp]C[This gives him a point. Unnecessary. and wastes a move.]
;W[no];B[km];W[lm];B[ng];W[mi];B[sq];W[ie];B[gd]C[This doesn't get a point. Are we out of points?]
;W[fm]C[I felt this meant white would attempt to use the stones captured in the ladder somehow. So I responded to this by capturing all of them. Unsure if was necessary or not.]
;B[hl];W[ai];B[bh];W[tt];B[tt]C[Overall I feel I did really well. I know there were some points
where I wasted stones, but I feel I played a great game. Also if
you can would you be able to tell me at about what level I am
playing? Not necessary, just curious because I haven't played
many actual humans mostly just bots, and I feel I am a little
higher than 17 kyu. Once again thank you for reviewing my
game.
-Andrew


Get on KGS and play some humans at your level. The computer is unevenly good at certain parts of the game (fighting, for example).

You did well. I don't know your history, so I can't say if it was  a good game or not. I can say that for most of the moves you made there was a better move you did not choose. Avoid "heavy" shapes like little triangles. Try to play more loosly, especially in the beginning. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to respond.]
