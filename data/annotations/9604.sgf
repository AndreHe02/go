C[Hi, I'm Ema, and I will start my commentary with E.
Many thanks to the reviewer!

E.: in this game I play with Black. I lost for a bunch of points, and I didn't manage to fully understand why I fell that back on territory at the end. Even if I lost my center group, I thought it was an even game.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]C[E.: here maybe an enclosure of one of my komokus would be better. Perhaps P17.

This is OK, as this is the beginning of the Kobayashi opening as you can see through the sequence shown.]

[dk:B][pm:C]C[E.: I think that now I'm really behind, after the opening.

P : Not really. There is still aji in A and invasion at B or C are also still possible if white extends around D.]
;W[qg]
(;B[cl]LB[dh:C][dk:D][co:A][cq:B]C[E.: looking for complications to catch up. The fact is that I had no idea on how to use this stone, so I simply threw it in, hoping in something.

P : In this situation I think this is an overplay. This move is an attacking move (aims at A or prepares for B) but more usefull when there is reinforcement in the upper right corner. But in your case back up the stones at isolate the marked stone.

Maybe a more reducing kind of move like is better here (D).]
;W[cj];B[gc]LB[el:B][pm:C][dr:A]C[E.: so C8 became a waste and strengthened White.

P : I think this move is too slow. There are far more important moves on the board now A to C for example.]

C[P : This sequence wasn't good. White is strong, you eliminate the aji around A and white has sente to play a big move around B.]

(;B[qp]LB[pm:B][np:A]C[P : I'm not sure if this is the best sequence. White is strong and your stones are cut in 2 (A and B). This creates problems later on in this region.]

;B[cr];W[nl]C[P : Cfr. move 52. White forces black and now black is being burdened by a weak group in the center and because your fuseki didn't emphasize development towards the center, help isn't easy to find. (some go book (I think attack and defense) states : he who controls the center controls the fighting).]

;W[lk]LB[lk:A]C[P : This move is very good for white, it presses the black group! You should avoid to give this kind of moves to your opponent. This A is one of the winning moves for white!]

;W[tt];B[tt]C[E.: I think I lost because of bad yose moves, and above all I didn't manage to save my center group (missed a move at G12, I think). Still, there must be something else. I feel that my opening was poor, and that I got this close to my opponent just because I took some advantage of the struggle in the center.
Any advice will be welcome.

Again, thanks for the review! :)

P : Your yose moves are not that bad, maybe you lost a few points but that was not the biggest problem. I think the most important mistakes were:

1.Trading your center group for capturing the small white group at the bottom, otherwise you could have won the game easily (20 point difference!).

2. Also, in your fuseki and middle game fighting, try to aim for development towards the center. If you would have done this, the fight in the center woud have been far more easier for you. 

3. When struggling for life, try to read out the moves that creates the most eye space (avoid moves like 116 and 130 for example!

I hope my advice is usefull! If you pay attention to these 3 main concepts, I think you will improve at least a couple of stones very fast!

Kind regards,
Philip])
