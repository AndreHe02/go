Thank you for reviewing my game.  I have supplied questions but if anything sticks out at you in the game feel free to tell me.  -Jon]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[od];B[mc];W[ob]C[This is my first time seeing this move ever, what is joseki?

One option is to sacrifice (for now) your stone on the top side and get strong along the right edge.  Since P18 is low, N17 can be regarded as light.

Alternatively, you can aim at L16 and fighting, but white should get the corner then.  Here that doesn't look as good to me because you can't develop the top with D16 there.

Finally, you could try to keep white out of the corner AND save N17, but then you get a tough fight.  Hard to predict what happens then!]
;B[pf];W[ne]C[So far this is joseki.];B[fc]LB[kd:A]C[Now I was thinking at A here but I felt that White might extend from his star point stone and pincer me and I'd screw up, but this move is clearly thin.  Suggestions?

Yes, this is certainly an overplay.  If I'm white, I'd play on top at this point (splitting the two black stones, or herding them together along the third line while making a big wall: then I can follow up at R12 if I make a big wall on top).

A is joseki, I'd say.  or somewhere around R10 -- maybe R11, with that stone on the bottom, is better balance.  Then you can let white spend yet another move on N17 -- it's a fair trade, you get the right side and he gets the top.]
;W[df];B[jd]C[Too thin!  White will get strong now.  White was nice to let you play here, though.  The fight would be at least fair.

Since N17 is so  much more outnumbered, and P18 is already on the second line, I would play J16 instead.  But strategically this is looking bad.  The weak group at the top is going to be trouble for you in the long run.]
;W[qi]C[R12 is probably better shape for white.  After R12, P13 and S14 look like good moves for the future.]
;B[ql]C[Setting yourself up to have two weak groups.];W[rc]
C[An overplay for white, should be R17 I think.];B[pc]C[With R17 instead, you might have some better choices later?]
;W[nc];B[mb]C[Your first really big mistake.  N17 should have been a light stone.  White is going to link up in the other direction anyway.  Your corner group is the important one, now: it is the one keeping white's two weak groups separated.  N18 just hurts your Q18 group.]
;W[pb];B[rd]C[Now white is almost settled in the corner, while you still are eyeless.  Ouch.  White is on the attack now.  N18 took territory on one side, gave white territory in the corner, and hurt your group.]
;W[qc];B[og];W[oi];B[mg]C[Now you are running along with white, but since white has already taken the corner, that's not so good for you.]
;W[ol];B[pl];W[nj];B[om];W[nm];B[nn];W[nl];B[on]C[White gave you a lot of territory in this corner, here, in return for a stronger group.  Now if you play simple and strong, you should be doing pretty well.]
;W[dq]C[My nextg question is here, how to proceed on the left side.  I felt an approach to the d3 stone would get pincered and would give white a good setup on the left side, so what should I do?

Well, let's look at the balance.  Your top right group is still a bit weak, and white's right side group has become pretty solid.  You have territory on the top and a big one on the bottom right, while white has a small corner.

In short, white has more influence, you have more territory.

So if you take the bottom while white takes the right side, that's OK, as long as the right side doesn't get too huge.

I'd be thinking about much slower moves here.  J4, F15, that kind of thing.  Or a nice safe move like C9 if you really must invade -- so you can extend in either direction after that.

Even S13 -- taking away your weakness -- doesn't look totally ridiculous, though it would be awfully slow.

M6, keeping a bit of pressure on white's group while aiming at reducing white's left side ... but white doesn't have a left side yet.

I feel like playing J4 and letting white get C9 is the simplest way to go, but it also feels a little wimpy to me even though that would become an awfully big territory on the bottom right for you.

The more I look at it, the more tempting C9 is.  Chances are you'll get to play something on the bottom side later anyway.  For example: you play C9, white C1, black C6, white C4, black J4.]
;B[ch];W[eg]C[White now has targets to attack everywhere: C12 could get in trouble fast, white can invade H17, and white can split at L15.  You are in trouble.]
;B[co]C[This is an overplay too.  Just C9 is fine!  If white plays C7, you still have C5 invasion to aim at later, plus you get to move first at J3.]
;W[jq];B[ep]C[So much for your hopes of making anything big out of the bottom right.  And your left side is very weak.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[gq];B[fq]C[This is almost always a bad move: uses up one of your liberties for no reason.  It's possible that you'd want to peep at F2 later.]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[hr];B[er];W[gs];B[cq]C[Would it be better to have just played C3 to begin with, and no F3 push first?  Look how strong white's group is now!  There's no possible threat anywhere.]
;W[dr];B[cr];W[dp];B[do];W[di]C[White is building up strength, and later H17 will probably hurt (or L15, maybe).

But black got strong on the bottom left and white got strong there too ... still, you are ahead in territory, so this can't be too bad for you.]
;B[cj];W[ek];B[dj];W[ej];B[dl];W[lf]C[Boom.  Finally your greed pays off: you took lots of territory, and left all your weak groups sitting ducks for white attack.  Now you get the suffering you deserve.  And white still will probably get N3 later, making a mockery of O6.]
;B[lg];W[kg];B[kh];W[li];B[mf];W[lh]C[White is crazy -- letting you link up like this has to be awful.  If white kept your groups separated, then there'd be a great opportunity to invade the top later.]
;B[ln];W[jh];B[kf]C[Why play this move now?  It'll still be sente later.]
;W[ki];B[ge]C[A little greedy again.  White is very strong here, play a simpler shape.]
;W[mq]C[White gets big endgame point #1.  This is huge.  It was inevitable that white would get it, though: whoever has the stronger groups keeps sente and gets the first big endgame point.]
;B[cc]C[I was at a loss to where the big points on the board are at this point so I decided to jump into the corner, any other ideas?

This point seems tough: white blocks one way or the other and hurts one or the other of your adjacent groups, no?

I would prefer B14 or D18 I think, aiming to take the corner next with less pain to your groups, or if white answers then you can take something big elsewhere.

G13 also looks very big.  Maybe an overplay though.  F7 perhaps.]
;W[dc];B[bd];W[db]C[Ouch.  Look how many points you lose on the top!  C17 doesn't seem to have worked.]
;B[ce];W[hc]C[here is where you wish you had played G16 or H16 instead of G15.]
;B[gc];W[he];B[ic];W[hb];B[hd]C[Now the game looks good for black.]
;W[ie];B[id];W[le];B[me];W[ke];B[ld];W[je];B[gg]C[Terrible sequence for white, though G19 later will be nice.]
;W[ff];B[gf];W[kd];B[kc];W[md];B[nd]C[Big ko, but white stands to lose something too.]
;W[cf];B[md];W[bf]C[So much for C17.];B[eb];W[cb];B[pd];W[sd]
;B[rb]C[This just helps white, doesn't it?];W[qb];B[se];W[sc]
;B[rf];W[nb];B[op];W[km];B[hk]C[My opponent ignored this for some reason.  What do you think of this?

It fits your style: dive right into the middle and hope you can save it somehow.  I would think that F7 is better (gets territory for you, and still threatens to destroy white's center).    But the edge is even bigger (B13, stuff like that).]
;W[nr];B[el]C[If you need a move like this now, then H9 was clearly an overplay!]
;W[ho];B[jk]C[Also looks like an overplay, and how much territory does it gain you/take away from white anyway?  B13 is bigger.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[gm];B[em];W[hi];B[fk];W[gl];B[gi]C[White shoiuld be willing to give up E10 and E9 in order to get H9 and K9!]
;W[ei];B[hj];W[hh];B[gh];W[gj]C[Sure looks like it was an overplay now, a big gift for white.]
;B[gn];W[gk];B[jm];W[kn];B[hn];W[in];B[hm];W[hl];B[il];W[fj]
;B[im];W[lo];B[mo];W[lm];B[lp];W[ko];B[mp];W[rk];B[rl];W[ci]
;B[bi];W[bj];B[bk];W[bh];B[aj];W[bg];B[cp];W[es]C[Now we're starting to enter into the end game.  I know the order is double sente, sente, and then gote moves, so I'm sure I've missed some and probably did not play them in the right order, could you give some advice?]
;B[hp];W[io];B[gp];W[cs];B[bs];W[ds];B[br];W[ma];B[la];W[na]
;B[lb];W[pr];B[qr];W[or];B[qq]C[Why not S3 (look at white R1 later...)?]

You are welcome! I hope I found some useful things to say, and not too many wrong ones.
