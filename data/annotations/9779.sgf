RE[W+8.5]
RU[Japanese]

C[Thank you for the chance to review this game.  I tend to be much more aggressive, so this was a good lesson for me in distant peaceful play.

Reviewing for the white side.  White ends with +8.5

black allowed peep at m14
black gave up r14

note: use shift + click in CGoban to jump to the move

Questions from white: R14 D8 J3

13: R14 : work with lower stones to build up side area
21: R16 : white can lean into the black corner and build up a supporting wall.
22: P14 : black needs to avoid leaning into a group making it stronger.
28: N13 : black double hane is critical mistake
29: M13 : use sente to block the corner group from expanding
31: M15 : moving to center is better after securing edges
38: L14 : black must respond to the peep
51: R2 : when groups are strong extend more
57: S16 : extend to take profit and reduce
73: K6 : avoid forcing opponent to connect
99: L15 : use tigers mouth to connect and attack and enter top center
105: E14 : connect indirectly to support two stones at once.
108: E12 : attack rather than defending a stong place
113: G9 : sacrifice a stone and protect the center
125: K15 : defend while keeping attack point strong

In general try to play some games where you win by just 5 or 10 points.  It can be painful to give up large bits of territory, and patiently wait for opportunities.

I did not see any stone sacrifices.  Try throwing in some stones just beyond where you hope to control, then sacrifice the stone, using it to defend or attack.]

[fq:C]C[Question from white player:
Im not sure about letting him grab a huge corner by playing this approach. Though it ended up leading to my biggest territory in the game, I wonder if it was a good move.

Response:
That is an interesting question, is this a good trade for white, to help black solidify the corner, while white takes the area on the side.

With P8 and Q8 as support something around Q14 feels important.

Another question is... why wait until now to play this stone?

I think black made a mistake with the R16 reply
A: R16: black makes a more solid corner, inviting white to take P14
B: P14 : black aims to jump into the Q12 area while getting out of the corner.
C: F3 : black leans into the corner, planning to play at J3, putting pressure on M4]

(;B[qd]LB[oe:B][of:A]C[A> game move extends R14 to grow the territory, 
however this may be too open, inviting black to jump in

B> suggested move leans into black in the corner while building up a stronger R14.  
The trade of a solid wall from nothing is worth pushing stones into the corner which is mostly alive.]

(;W[of]LB[me:C][ne:A][mf:B]C[A> game move has black leaning into P14 to build up the corner
B> possible move separates P14 from K16
C> suggested move extends black and separates K16 from P14, looking to jump into H17

Move A has the side effect of forcing white to take a very sold right side.
Move B looks to be too far with P16 so open.]

This is a risky move, but with support at R14 and Q8 I would do it.]

B joins the two white groups, taking away any worries about the floating white group, turning a weak group that will fall under attack into a huge fighting weapon.]

(;B[cn]LB[ch:B][dl:A]C[A: D8 : game move : attack group directly
B: C12 : suggested move : divide side up into two parts

This is connected with the player question on move 46, where the territory on the upper left was large.

Giving up territory to the opponent can be painful, hopefully we can grab just a bit more in each exchange.]

(;W[dl]C[Question from white player:
I am also not sure about this move.

Reply:
It may need some development of M5 and C16 first
The risk of not taking M14 is big.

This feels like white and black are playing an exciting dare game by not taking the obvious point at M14]

(;W[iq]C[Question from white player:

This one as well. though it lets me stableize my territory it gives a lot to him on the upper left.
Is there a way I could have avoided such an exchange? (either now or maybe several moves before. )

Reply from reviewer:

exchanges like this are good for the game, you get support for your M4 stones and he gets something to attack J14 with.

black did take D13, but white got M14, which made J14 so strong it cannot be attacked.

the D8 move did force black to get thicker on the side.  attacking around C2 would help separate]
