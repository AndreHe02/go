C[Hello Confused and tyr.  I am Merzuq the Camel Herder, and I'll be your Friendly reviewer.  (Fletcher in real life)  Just read along, and be sure to catch all the variations (Marked with *s).  I tend to be very verbose, so if you already know something I'm writing about, or if you simply don't care, feel free to skip ahead.      Any ?'s, just drop me and E-mail at:

All right, let's go!];B[qp]C[My name is Jakub Zielinski, IGS 25k.  I've  been playing for about two months.
This is a game I played as Black against a  22kyu. I won 87 to 80.5 (komi was .5).   I will refer to points  by coordinates from  the lower left corner, so this is (17, 4) for  example.]
;W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[qj]C[All righty, Con.  We'll start with this move here.  The opening is a tricky spot, and we're about to talk about why.  Now there is nothing  wrong with this move, but after your next move, do you still want the stone to be exactly THERE?  The opening is all about getting your stones in a perfect corelation, and making your opponents awkward.  What proper arangments are you pretty much just have to figure out over time.]
;W[oq];B[qn]LB[po:a][pn:b][mp:c][mq:d]C[Ok, Here's what I was saying.  Look at the three stones on the bottom right side.  They are "Low".   Pretty much all I can say about this is the benifit of playing around a side star point is that you can fight for thickness in the neighboring corners and build a Lovely Moyo.  R-6 kind of impedes your own territory building without hurting your opponents.  Examples of proper moves are 'a' and 'b', both of which put your stone at R10 in a good spot.   The more complex moves of 'c' and 'd'  would also be very good here, but you'd need to study these Joseki first.  I wouldn't recomend an attachment at Q3 because it forces White to strengthen his stone at P3, and make the beginings of a moyo on the bottom.]
;W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[fq]LB[rr:a][lq:b]C[Just as a note, I want to make sure you know the importance of the move at 'a'.  Whether or not you need to play it NOW isn't definite, but I probably would have.  It's what they call a move that affects both players eye-bases.  It means that you can feel safe no matter what kind of strange things happen in the area.  it also makes whites three stones there look real dumb and out of place.  White would probably extend to 'b'.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[jq];W[lq]LB[jo:a][lr:b][hq:c]C[A very important move by white, and one that required a responce by black at 'a' or 'b'.  Why?  Look at the variation for one possible continuation of White's powerful invasion at 'c'*]

(;B[nd]LB[lr:a][jo:b]C[I made this move because I thought the  stone at the 4-4 point could use some help.   Would it have been better to play near the  side star point or approach White's stone?

As mentioned before, 'a' or 'b' is absolutley necesary right now.  Those aside I'd recomend aproaching white's stone in the top right.  The beauty of a star point stone is it's versatility.  I personally don't feel you should secure one like this until you are 100% sure what you need it to be doing.  (meaning till the neighboring corners are played out.)  Of course this is a matter of taste.]
;W[qf]C[Dangerous play by White, and uneccesary early invasion.  Better off defending the left side.]
;B[qe];W[pf]
(;B[fc]TR[qf][pf]C[Not the best.  Look at how desperate the white stones are to be attacked.  Attacks on these stones will most definetly be sente, so you must play them ASAP!  Don't worry so much about killing them, just use the attack to put some stones in valuable spots. Please see variation for example. *]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[jc];W[ld];B[lc]
(;W[lf]LB[mc:a]C[An unusual move white, the hane of 'a' as a sacrifice is the most common follow-up. *]
;B[cj]C[Definetly the biggest point on the board.];W[ch];B[cm]
;W[cn]
(;B[dm]LB[ej:a]C[Now I really don't like this move.  It is begging for the capping move white plays.  In this situation you want to get out of harms way by hopping into the center.  If he continues to attack the C7 stone, you can just hop further out into the center, safely breaking free of Whites influence.  Once you're out there you can make a base if you want as in the variation. *]
;W[em];B[el];W[fm];B[fl];W[eo]C[Too tight, White.];B[gm];W[ko]
LB[hq:a]C[Remember, like I said before, 'a' is the way to play here.]
;B[jo];W[kn];B[fn]C[This is unnessacary, black.  It is gote for you to play these two moves, and white can't break through cleanly anyways.  Try for yourself to see what happens when white where you played at F6 or at G6.]
;W[en];B[fo];W[po];B[ef]LB[ff:a]C[Better at 'a'.  As you see in the following moves, this is not a solid connection.]
;W[ee];B[fe];W[ff];B[eg];W[cg]
(;B[dh]C[See variation for something nice! *];W[gg];B[gf];W[fg]
;B[fh];W[hg];B[if]LB[hf:a]C[Too loose black.  White could easily have broken through at 'a'.]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[jg];B[hf]C[Deffinetly nessecary to patch up your shape.]
;W[kg]LB[mc:a]C[Now would be a great time to take advantage of the previously mentioned move at 'a', white.]
;B[km]LB[nf:a][kr:b][kd:c][pn:d]C[I did not see much hope of breaking up  White's territory so I played a capping  move at (11,7).   Would playing alongside  the black stones at (10,6) have been a  better idea?

This move doesn't really seem to do anything.  A white responce at K6 absolutely destroys it.  Several other moves on the board are much bigger.  'a' through 'd' are examples of how to play here, 'a' being the best, cutting off the two white stones from the others.]
;W[lm];B[kl];W[ll];B[lk]C[Too loose, still.  See how bad a spot you'd be in if white played K6?]
;W[lh]LB[nf:a][jn:b]C[Overly tight, white.  You could connect at 'a', or play the waiting cut at 'b'!]
;B[mg];W[lg];B[mf];W[me];B[ne];W[mh];B[of];W[pg]LB[ph:a]C[Better one line lower at 'a']
;B[nh]LB[ng:a]C[Nothing wrong with this move.  Got to keep his groups separated.  Remember too however that he can separate YOU by giving atari at 'a'.]
;W[qi];B[pi];W[ph];B[oi];W[qc]LB[re:a]TR[qf][pf][pg][ph][qi]
C[This invasion proved very troublesome.  Is  there a way to kill it now or did I need to  play underneath white's empty triangle to  protect myself to begin with?

A move at 'a' strait up KILLS white's marked group.  That more than makes up for a loss in the corner. *]

(;B[pc]C[This IS the standard move in the situation.];W[qd]
LB[re:a]C[This isn't though.  The situation is now simple to deal with.  'a' would have been the move for white, and is where black should play now.]
;B[pe];W[re];B[ri];W[qh];B[rg];W[rf];B[qb];W[rb];B[ra]C[An obvious blunder]
;W[pb];B[ob]C[I save as much as I can.];W[qa];B[oa];W[qb];B[jn]
;W[mn];B[mk];W[ml];B[nl]C[An attempt to limit White's territory on the  lower right.  Would an attack on the weaker  formation in the upper center have been  better?

Definetely.  a play at the center star point at K10 leaves white with little hope for these stones.]
;W[gh];B[fi];W[gi];B[ji];W[ii];B[jj];W[ij];B[ik];W[kj];B[kk]
;W[ki];B[gj]LB[jh:a]C['a' the vital point, black.];W[ni];B[nj]
LB[ng:a][jh:b][mc:c]C[White, there is no need to save this stone in atari!  A play at 'a' still catches two stones, and gives black no chance to defend.  a move at 'b' should have come before the move at O11 though, to guarantee your eye space.  The play at 'a' is a powerful, have-it-your-way move that is the hallmark of a strong player.]
;W[mi];B[lj]C[An obvious mistake.  I ought to have  protected against the double atari ...    Yup.]
;W[ng];B[oh]C[The two stones more important here.];W[nf]LB[mc:a]
C[Now the white sacrifice-move at 'a' availiable again.];B[og]
;W[jh];B[jk];W[hj];B[hk];W[eb];B[fb];W[bn];B[bm];W[er];B[fr]
;W[bh];B[kd]TR[eb][bn][er]LB[lr:a][rr:b]C[Neccesary, but gote.  White's marked strait-down endgame moves left you a mutitude of sente hanes you should take advantage of now.  also, the moves of 'a' and 'b' are huge now.  Remember 'a'?  We talked about that move earlier.]
;W[ke];B[md];W[le];B[je];W[kp];B[jp];W[nm];B[ol]C[I'm sure you feel like you're being pushed around right now black.  White's last move was one you could ignore and play some sente moves of your own.]
;W[om];B[pm];W[pn];B[pp];W[op];B[qr];W[qo];B[rp]C[I did not see the two Black stones could be  put in atari until it actually happened.  My  plan was simply to block at the 5-2 point.]
;W[pr]LB[ro:a]C[cutting at 'a' would have been huge for white.]
;B[ro];W[rr]C[Double-atari still there...];B[rm];W[sr]C[too small, white.]
;B[sq]C[You have to get out of the habit of automatically responding to your opponents move, black.]
;W[qs]C[again unnessacary.];B[kr];W[lr];B[cq]C[If you can't read out an invasion, it's better just to reduce.  This area is too narrow to invade.]
;W[cp];B[dr];W[es];B[bp];W[br];B[an];W[ao];B[am];W[bo];B[fs]
C[I give up on the invasion];W[bq];B[ep];W[dq];B[bi];W[cc];B[ea]
;W[da];B[fa];W[db]C[White's corner is now secure.  Could I  have invaded before?

No, it was too tight.  In the endgame it's almost always too late for an invasion.  Anything like should have happened like 80 moves ago, when positions weren't so solid.]
;B[ls];W[ms];B[ks];W[mr];B[ed];W[de];B[rh];W[ci];B[bj];W[di]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[dj];W[dg]TR[bi]C[I failed to anticipate this tactic on White's  part.

Goes to show that the marked stone was an overplay. (move 177)]
;B[fj];W[eh];B[sf];W[se];B[sg];W[mj];B[qg];W[rd];B[sb];W[sc]
;B[li];W[kh];B[kq];W[oj]C[Another attack I didn't see.  I suppose I  should watch cutting points more closely

Ok, Here's one of the coolest things about Go.  If you've ever seen a pro game, you'll notice that they usually end with a margin of just a few points.  between evenly ranked amateur players, the same thing often happens, just with a greater margin.  No matter what players do to try to thwart the other, using different strategies, they come out even.  Now look at your game.  If you look at the board, you are well ahead in territory.  You can also see that white has been taking advantage of a lot of cutting points you have left, and that you have lost seven stones, and white none.  I am trying to say that the balance in Go is amazing to me.  You don't really have to worry about cutting points exactly, just balance and flexibility.  And remain poised to attack if your opponent falls off balance or becomes stiff.  just like, well, any of the physical martial arts!

Just as a side note, confused, I tend to fight more like you, aiming for big territories and I am always willing to sacrifice for better position.  It is just as viable a strategy as any other.  Just worry about balance and flexibility.  If you don't mind my Kung-fu metaphor, It's the Monkey and the Crane, grasshopper. :)]

;W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[Well that's it!  A pretty close game over all.  I hope my review was a help.  If you have any other questions, feel free to e-mail them to me.  And stay positive, with time all the wierd complexities of Go will start to make sense.  Ah well, Good-bye, take care, and ma assalama!

Well I suppose it's pretty obvious that Go is impossibly complex (Which is of course part of why we like it so much), and the most help anyone can give you in a terse fasion in simply the "right idea".  And for here it is:  Whenever somebody separates a little group like that, Fight to connect!  (That being the opposite of the offensive proverb "Divide and Conquer")]
