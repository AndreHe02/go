AB[dp][pd]C[Hi Aaron,

I'm around 7k in strength and I'll be reviewing your game. I'll mark my comments with a "C" so you know it's me. I'll comment mainly on black's moves, since that's the side your playing, but I'll try to make some insights into why white mades the moves he did and how that might affect your play.]
PL[W];W[dd];B[cf]C[C: Your first move seems a bit off balance. Usually, in handicap games, it's better to play safe because you start off with an advantage before you even do anything. Especially because white played on hoshi and not komoku, it's much better here to just take the fourth corner rather than kakari.]
;W[fc]
(;B[dj]C[C: Again, much better to take the fourth corner with this move. D10 is slow; you already invested a move on the left side and C14 is not in immediate danger. See variation, white cannot take serious advantage of a black tennuki.]
;W[pp]C[C: White is satisfied with a second corner]
(;B[pm]C[C: First of all, the kakari is better from the other side. Since you already have a position on the left side, setting up on the bottom would result in the favorable "double wing" shape. Also, this move is very light. Not bad, but the normal keima kakari is much more natural and more often played. Don't forget you start with the advantage in handicap games. Playing safe is the best way to minimize the difference in skill level between two players, if you start going into positions you aren't familiar with, it gives the more experienced player opportunities.]
;W[qo]C[C: I don't think this move is joseki.];B[pi]C[C: R10 gives a better shape here.]
;W[nc]C[C: This move is a mistake by white. It is important to secure the bottom right with an addition move at O3. If white really wants to approach the top right, O16 is better, as F17 is already low.]

(;B[pc]C[C: Too passive! White's position in the bottom right is not secure yet, and Q11 already supports the hoshi stone.]
;W[kc]C[C: Very bad for white, this play must be high at K16 or L16.]

(;B[ne]C[C: Again, this move is a bit too passive. The biggest move is still on the bottom right. If you want to reduce the top, the proper move is at K16, taking advantage of white's mistake in making the very low position.]
;W[fq]C[C: White takes the largest play on the board.];B[fp]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[eq];B[dq];W[jq]
(;B[dm]C[C: The shape is more solid at D6, but either way, tennuki is better. The continuation is tricky, but the flower ko is here.]

(;W[ef]C[C: A poor move from white. B16 is the vital move for the corner. The left side is too big for such a slow reduction and the top is unfavorable because of the black stone at O15.]

(;B[dh]C[C: Better to start with the sente move at B16.];W[fh]

(;B[np]C[C: White is not strong on the bottom, it is possible to invade deeper.]
;W[nq]
(;B[oo]C[C: This move is very strange. P4 is more natural here, as it is sente.]
;W[pk]
(;B[ok]C[C: This shape is almost always bad. It seems you are trying too hard to kill the Q9 stone. Remember, attaching to weak stones makes them stronger.]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[ql];B[qk];W[rk];B[qj];W[rj];B[ri];W[pn];B[on]
;W[ol];B[om];W[nl];B[oq];W[op];B[mq];W[nr];B[mo]C[C: Connecting directly is usually better. White has good aji with the peeps.]
;W[or]C[C: White wastes a move here, it is not possible to kill the O3 group anyway. Defending at K5 is very important right now.]

(;B[kq]C[C: Very bad! The white group is extremely weak, attaching to K3 removes all possibility of attacking it.]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[ko];B[lo];W[kn];B[jr];W[ir];B[kr]
(;W[hq]C[C: This move is unnecessary, white does not have to sorry about the cut. In addition, white can stabilize the bottom group in sente by playing at D2 instead.]
;B[lm];W[nk];B[oj];W[lk];B[km]C[C: The difference on the board after L3 is huge. Note that white used L3 to stabilize the bottom group and has now saved his O8 group using the extra stones from the L3 sequence.]
;W[jm];B[kk];W[mi];B[nh];W[mh];B[mg];W[lg];B[mf];W[kh];B[ke]
C[C: This move serves no purpose. White's center group is strong and can no longer be attacked. There are several major sente moves on the board remaining, the largest being at B16. Some other moves to consider for later are E2 and P18, the second of which is a major sente endgame move.]
;W[jd]C[C: Notice the exchange of black L15 for white K16 improves white's shape.]
;B[jl]C[C: This move is very small. Your group is in no danger, so it is not necessary to defend it. Again, the largest move right now is at B16.]
;W[im];B[il];W[hm];B[hj];W[hh]C[C: This exchange also improves white's shape.]

(;B[if]C[C: The keima can be easily cut because of white's stone on K16. I found an interesting tesuji here that can cut off white's stone at F12 beginning with J13 here in place of J14.]
;W[je];B[kf];W[jf];B[ih];W[ii];B[jg];W[jh];B[kg];W[ig];B[cd]
C[C: Good! This is the largest place on the board.];W[cc];B[bd]
;W[de];B[ce]C[C: The solid connection is not necessary, your group is already safe. The biggest endgame move now is at P18.]
;W[ln];B[mm]C[C: It's more solid to just connect at N6.];W[mn]
;B[mj];W[nm];B[nn];W[po];B[pj];W[nj];B[ni];W[lj];B[kj]C[C: Any play in the center now is small. Remember that in the endgame, moves in the center usually don't make much impact if they don't concern the life of a group. Once things start to settle, you should be looking for sente moves on the side. Although initially, these moves look small, they cause solid swings of 5-10 points, and judging by the outcome of this game, these are enough to turn things around. P18 is the move here. This move alone swings the game by 2-3 points, but the key here is that it is also sente, as white is forced to respond at O18, meaning you gain 2-3 points and lose nothing. People who are good at endgame are the people that can find these sente strings, taking solid points without losing momentum.]
;W[fj];B[gk];W[fk];B[gl];W[fl];B[gm];W[go];B[gn];W[hl];B[hk]
;W[hn];B[bc]C[C: This move is dangerous. Black still needs to watch out for the potential cutting points at F6 and E4.]
;W[dl];B[em]C[C: You are forced to protect the cut and lose some points here.]
;W[dk];B[cb];W[dc];B[cm];W[bl];B[bm];W[bk];B[er];W[am];B[an]
;W[al];B[bo];W[ci];B[di];W[ch];B[dg]C[C: Black loses around 30 points from this sequence.]
;W[ob]C[C: White takes the big point.];B[qb]C[C: The response is strange, blocking at Q18 is fine.]
;W[db];B[bb];W[ll]C[C: Unnecessary, this move is aji keshi.]
;B[kl];W[ij];B[ml]C[C: It seems that white missed this tesuji.]
;W[li];B[mk];W[fr];B[dr];W[bg];B[bf];W[si];B[sh];W[rh]C[C: A big mistake by white, giving up sente. T10 is the only way to continue.]
;B[sj];W[sl];B[da];W[ea];B[ca];W[eb];B[pb]C[C: Notice that playing R18 instead of Q18 before put you back a move, and lowered your score by one point, as you essentially filled up one space of your own territory.]
;W[le];B[lf];W[ld];B[hg];W[ih];B[gi];W[gh];B[fi];W[eg];B[eh]
;W[cj];B[cg];W[ah]C[C: It is more solid to connect directly at B12.]

;B[eo];W[es];B[ds];W[fs];B[mc];W[mb];B[md];W[lc];B[cl];W[ck]

;B[oa];W[la];B[na];W[js];B[af];W[ma];B[pa];W[lh];B[ag];W[bh]
;B[ej];W[is];B[pr];W[pq];B[ik];W[jj];B[ki];W[kd];B[lp]C[C: Not necessary. Remember that filling in your own territory like this subtracts one from your score at the end, something that usually doesn't make a difference at the kyu level, but play like every point counts, as in a close game like this, it does.]

C[C: In my opinions, you played better than 14 kyu in this game. However, there are several things you should keep in mind.

The two major mistakes you made this game was the attachment at L3 and missing the defensive move on the left side at F6. Missing the move at F6 is more of a technical mistake, you probably just didn't read it closely and therefore didn't see the tesuji resulting from the two possible cutting points close together. This can be fixed just by playing more carefully.

The move at L3, though, was the losing move in the game. You should never let your opponent settle a weak group for free. Remember, the essence of Go is attack. Territory is just something you get along the way. The common misconception among a lot of newer players is that "attacking" means killing stones, for instance, your move at P9. In reality, unless you have a lot of local influence, it's usually very hard to kill groups unless your opponent makes a major mistake. I know what you're thinking, you have an outline on the fourth line and when your opponent jumps in like that, it seems like he's taking *your* territory, and you have to kill it because otherwise, you'd be giving away something for nothing. However, remember the old saying: the third line is for territory and the fourth line is for power. What this means is that positions based on the fourth line are typically easy to invade and live, so making territory isn't the point of playing on the fourth line. Instead, when your opponent jumps in like that, you attack it by putting pressure, forcing your opponent to play defensive moves to save the group while you build up a strong position. Basically, when you attack, all your moves should be attacking his group and doing something else, like making a wall or building territory, while all his moves should only be saving his weak group. This is the fundamental basic of attacking in Go. Learning to balance defense of your own weaknesses and attack of your opponents is the whole idea of the game, everything revolves around this balance of attack and defense. If you keep this mentality during your games, I think you'll start to see the board more clearly. Instead of just looking at outlines of territory, you'll start looking for weaknesses in both your own groups and your opponent's.

The second major thing I noticed in your play is your yose judgement seems to need some work. Finding the big endgame moves, especially sente or reverse sente, can cause big swings in points. If you really fine-tune your yose, you'll go up 1-2 stones in strength.

Well, that's pretty much it. If you have any further questions, feel free to email me. I used a lot of terminology assuming you'd know, but if anything is unclear, most of the definitions should be somewhere online. Failing, that, you can ask me directly. I hope I helped your understanding of the game, and good luck in the future!]
