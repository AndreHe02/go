C[tsukrus [8k\]: hi


ts: Hello. Thank you in advance for your review! This game was very interesting for me. Although I lost by resignation, I had a chance to win and probably had a lead at some time. Because of nature of this game, there was plenty of choices, so plenty mistakes too;)

ts: Most interesting position for me is before B95. I misread results of crosscuts and then it all went wrong. So question of the game would be "Where to play B95?".

P.S. Please forgive me for tons of questions - I don't have any sort of teacher, so have to get as much as I can from reviews like this.

(;B[hf]C[ts: Am I to greedy here? Is my corner still invadeable if B83 at P2 or Q2, because that would be huge as I see AFTER the game? I one of my variations black can kill corner invasion, do I miss something?

*******
Your corner is invadeable but you can live. The game move is good because it works towards bringing together your weak groups. However, connecting them directly is better.]

;W[mg]
(;B[gj]C[ts: Not sure about this move. Perhaps this move or move before, or even before that is sighn of my indecisiveness. I want to do to many things at once: separate top white four stones, contest top area and separate lower left white group from rest. Here I misread continuation...

Perhaps K16 or something similar would be better at least by focusing on one thing?

*******
I agree the situation is complicated.

Its not so much to focus on one thing as figuring out what the biggest thing is. For example, if you killed the left white group but lost the top black group, would that be good or bad?

This is fairly difficult to answer, but killing the white group is worth about 30 points, whereas the top is worth more like 40. Also white gets his G17 group out of trouble,.

This move forces a ko, and its good to realize whats at stake. If white ignores a ko threat and takes at F7, suddenly the black center stones also come under risk - at least 15 points. But this can also lead to another ko.

In general, you don't want to start a ko like this and make things even more complicated if you are winning. But here its even difficult to tell who is winning.

I think attacking up top is the best strategy now, as it can settle your weak center group, and you can possibly use this ko to assist you in the fighting. But I am not entirely sure myself here.]
;W[gk]
(;B[hk];W[hj];B[gi];W[hl];B[ig]C[ts: Plan B - capture three white stones and safely devastate top area. I didn't see, how much of devastation white will bring.]
;W[gm]

This isn't that big a gain for white. Wrecking the top and attacking g17 is big.]
;B[go];W[fn];B[hp];W[io]

(;B[pq]C[ts: My corner group gets captured after capturing race, so I didn't see any way to win after that. I tryed several variations, but not sure those are any good. This is my last comment. Thank you for your time.]
;W[pr]
(;B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[ro];B[rn];W[qo];B[po];W[rl]C[**********
This is a classic position. When white invades at 3-3 and plays this way, this is the resulting position. The cut at q6 is important. If black has to protect, white is alive, otherwise white is dead. Here, there are also connection possibilities at T6.]

;B[oo];W[mn];B[sq];W[rs]C[***********************

So overall, an exciting game.

Here are the areas of improvement I see:

*******
- Black did not play the joseki correctly on top right.
- Black needed to connect his corner and side stones on the top right. White could always cut here, though the game ended before he did so.
- Black should have driven the right side group out rather than cutting the base.
- Black missed the opportunity to cut off the left hand white group.
- At the bottom, the one space jump was exploitable, but not by directly cutting, as was in the game.
- Black was late to connect his top and left stones. This could have been exploited better by white.
- As you saw yourself, the center stones could have faced a ko instead of outright death.
- Black could have saved the corner by blocking in the other direction. Also, even if this mistake were made, black could still make a ko, and probably live.

Generally speaking, you seem to have a good fighting spirit and do well enough with direction issues. You need to be more sensitive to connection/disconnection issues both in yourself and in your opponent. These are big moves, even if they don't seem to produce points directly. Cutting weak opponent groups or connecting your own weak groups is generally bigger than any territory or eye making type move.

Good luck with your games,
Dave])
