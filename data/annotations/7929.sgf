C[#R#: A is not completely wrong, but I don't like kosumi like this, because it strenghtens white (He will sure answer here). So your K16 stone can better attack later. D14 is best answer for black.]
;W[fd]C[#R#: A must for white.];B[df];W[md]LB[hd:A]C[#R#: Normally white has to answer at A, but in a handicap game a move around N16 is mostly played.]
;B[lc]C[#R#: You strenghtens white secondly... Play Q14.];W[mc]
;B[pf];W[jf]C[How to answer here?

#R#: Now imagine the position without white stones F16 and N16. It would look be easier for you. I would escape at L15. (See variation)]
(;B[if];W[ie];B[je];W[hf];B[kf];W[ig];B[ic]LB[lg:A]C[#R#: I would play simpler in a handicap game... Maybe you should attack the white N17 group indirectly with A. Note that if white jumps out with N13 you has to manage two groups to save: The center AND the right corner.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[kc];B[oc]C[#R#: There is no time for P17. You have to save your center group immediatly!]
;W[mf]
(;B[kg];W[lh]LB[lg:A][kh:B]C[Could I do anything but run here?

#R#: No. Because P17 you get attacked now. Your center group has no eye -> you have to run. L13 is a bit slowly I think. Instead I would play at A or B (See variation). If you running, you must try to getting ahead. (What is against a 5p not easy ;-)]
;B[jh];W[jj];B[ii];W[ej];B[gi];W[di]
(;B[hk]LB[ei:A]C[#R# This looks not bad. I would cut here at E11 instead of H9. (See variation)]
;W[fh]
(;B[fb]LB[ce:A][mg:C][dh:B]C[#R#: Save the corner is not big because the weak point at A. And: It is gote. You must not play gote moves at this stage of the game. If you would play in the corner, B is a good point I think. At first you have to think of your center group! Cutting at C looks also interesting.]
;W[gb];B[eb];W[fp];B[dn];W[fm];B[hb]C[#R#: Hm. Looks like a connection. But I have found no way for black to connect. (See variations)]
(;W[mp]
(;B[jn]LB[fj:B][ek:A]C[#R#: A little angry, but the right direction. You have to save your center group. This is the main problem in the whole game! Better try around A or B.]
;W[im];B[jm];W[il];B[mn]LB[nm:B][no:A]C[What about this move? I was not sure if it is good enough

#R#: This is OK. Maybe too narrow to the K7 group. A here looks natural for me. In a handicap game I would play B.]
;W[oo];B[nq]C[#R#: Must at Q5 I think.];W[np];B[oq];W[mq];B[om]
C[#R#: Nice point.];W[po];B[qp]C[#R#: S4 better...];W[pm];B[ol]
;W[pl]
(;B[ok]C[#R#: Must at Q9. You make it too easy for white. Mostly it is correct to play on the top of two stones. White cannot cut here (See variation)]
;W[ro]
(;B[qo]C[#R#: Play S4 first. If white connect, it is sente for you.]
;W[qn];B[rp];W[ph]C[#R#: White is to cut your right side. You have to answer. This is VERY IMPORTANT! (See variation) In my opinion this is the biggest mistake in the game.]
(;B[go];W[fo];B[qg]LB[oh:A]C['r': A is better. Try to connect your groups!]

;W[pn]
(;B[ml]LB[jk:A]C[#R#: A is a good point here. Cut white and fight is better than let surround you with little life. (See variation)]

;W[fn];B[cq];W[mb];B[jk];W[qc]C[My feeling is that white can be killed, but I didn't know how...
#R#: White can live with Ko. (See variation). There are many threats, but in a handicap game it is mostly unreasonable for black.
The problem is, if you loose the Ko-fight, you have to make two eyes for your group. The first mistake in this sequence was R13.]

;W[nn]C[#R#: This Ko is very big... Now you can see why must to connect with your upper right group at move 64.]

;W[bo];B[bn];W[ep];B[do];W[br]C[#R#: Here white is already ahead. You can't win the game now :-(.

I think the main problem in the game was that you hasn't connect your groups. Especially the upper right corner group and the K6 group came under great pressure. Also you must not leave weak groups on the board (like your center group). This rule is important, especially in handicap games.
