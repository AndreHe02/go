;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[qm]LB[cj:a][nc:b]
[qn:c][qf:d]C[This move is a little unusual. Some move at 'a', 'b', 'c' or 'd' is perhaps more common.]
;B[qo];W[qf]TR[qm][qo]LB[qj:a]C[This move abandons the marked White stone. The marked black stone defends the corner and attacks the white stone sowhite should play something like 'a' instead. Then the black corner will not be so strong anymore.]
;B[qh];W[of]C[I think this is a good way for white trying to fight back]
;B[nd];W[pi];B[ph];W[oh];B[qi];W[pj];B[qj];W[pk];B[rl];W[rm]
LB[ql:a]C[I think White 'a' is simple and good enough. That move will also top Black from connecting.]
;B[ql];W[pm];B[pg];W[og];B[pf];W[dj]LB[pl:a][nm:b]C[It is painful to have the cut at 'a' left for white. Perhaps a move at 'a' or 'b' is necessary - that would turn the center white group into thickness -now it is weak]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[ge];B[kc]C[A slow move. White has no potential in this area and it does not seem to defend the upper right corner.]
;W[go]LB[lq:a][nq:b][or:c]C[I do not think that White can compete with Blacks territories. Perhaps Whites best chanse is to start a fight with an invasion at 'a', 'b' or 'c'?]
;B[hq];W[gj];B[hm]C[Strange move];W[hn]LB[in:a]C[This is to kind. A white stone at 'a' would cut of the black stone with no hope of an easy rescue.]
;B[jm];W[gm]LB[im:a][jn:b]C[This move has no fighting spirit.
'a' would cut of a black stone.
'b' could start a fight that might ruin the black lower side.]
;B[hl]LB[jn:a]C[Black is gaining but White could still play at 'a', in order to start a fight.]
;W[gl]LB[cq:a][cj:b]C[It is always nice to play a move that seems to defend a huge area... but is it really so important? Black can still easily invade at 'a' and 'b' is could be possible in the future if fighting breaks out.]
;B[ih]TR[of][og][oh][pi][pj][pk][pm]C[Black is still playing moves that is not properly connected in any way. Now the White marked stones comes to life.]
;W[nm]C[After this good move White should try to fight as much as possible.]
;B[gh];W[dg]LB[ij:a][jn:b][jd:c]C[The key point here is 'a'. It make both 'b' and 'c' into very serious threats to black. The left side territory is not important at this stage of the game. If Black goes further into the left side it is just one more stone to kill...!]
;B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[np]LB[cf:a][ij:b][nq:c][pr:d][kq:e][oo:f]
C[Good. If White defended at 'a' it would lead to overconcentration, but a move at 'b' would be even more severe now. Locally perhaps c is better because it htreaten both 'd', 'e' and 'f'.]
;B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[ll]LB[mn:a]C[White has to hane at the head of the two black stones, it will probably lead to confused tactical fighting but a hane will give black trouble with the shape in the future. The move played only defends the strong white center group which is against the logic of go.]
;B[ln];W[qq];B[pq];W[rp];B[ro];W[pr];B[rr];W[qr]C[There does not seem to be any alternative to this move.]
;B[rq];W[rs]LB[qp:a][sp:b][po:c]C[White 'a' is much better here. If Black answers at 'b' then white will threaten a cut at 'c' later...]
;B[qp];W[nr]LB[po:a][ij:b][jn:c]C[Now white is doomed to lose this fight, because Black does not need to defend at  'a' and thus gains one move for free... Perhaps White should accept the fate of group in the corner and play 'b'. Depending on how Black answers  white could then perhaps play 'c' and force black into connecting in a way that leaves the side territory vulnerable.]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[oq];W[sr];B[sp];W[or];B[lq];W[lr];B[kr]LB[ls:a]
[kq:b][jr:c]C[As a consequence of these stubborn moves Black becomes even thicker. But it not completely bad since White now could try moves like 'a', 'b' or 'c']
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pb];B[ob];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[sd];W[rc];B[pc]
LB[oc:a]C[Probably a mistake. Since it forces White to live it would be more solid to play at 'a'.]
;W[qa]LB[qe:a][oc:b]C[White lives easily, and has two cuts at 'a' and 'b' for future tesujis perhaps.]
;B[ij]C[The drawback of the successful invasion is that black suddenly plays the move that both players should had played a long time ago. Now White need a miracle to win.]
;W[li]LB[dr:a]C[This is not a miracle move. It would almost be better now to leave this group weak hoping that Black would loose the temper and attack it, hoping for a chance to counter attack.  A move at 'a' is huge now.]
;B[fg];W[eg];B[fi];W[fj];B[eh];W[ch];B[di];W[ci];B[ej];W[ek]
;B[ei];W[ck]LB[hi:a]C[White is playing like he is in the lead. Best way here is to play elsewhere because black cannot do anything. White 'a' does not work now - otherwise that would be the fighting move.]
;B[ae];W[bf];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[br];W[bq];B[cr]C[It is terrible to let black get this sequence. Now white is way behind.]
;W[mc]C[A slightly vulgar move but it shows the right sort of fighting spirit.]
;B[nc];W[ld]LB[lc:a];B[kd];W[le];B[ke];W[lf];B[hd];W[gd];B[gc]
;W[id]C[This looks unreasonable at first sight, but White has no choice but to fight it out now.]
;B[he];W[ie];B[hf];W[if];B[ig];W[kf];B[jf];W[jg];B[je];W[jc]
;B[kb]LB[jb:a]C[Black 'a' is perhaps simpler];W[mb];B[ic];W[ib]
;B[jb];W[hi]C[Good. Even if it does not work it put mental pressure on the opponent.]
;B[gf];W[ii];B[jh];W[jj]TR[ij]LB[jn:a][kn:b][ls:c][nq:d]C[Up to now White has gained a fighting opportunity -but this move is a complete waste. It has no purpose other than to attack the marked stone that already has lost any strategic value. The fighting moves here are 'a', 'b', 'c' and perhaps 'd'. Some combination of those moves and a mistake from Black could give White some hope.]
;B[in]C[If the last white move was a losing move this is a winning move.]
;W[jk]C[it is better to resign than playing a move than this.]
;B[mm];W[ml];B[kl];W[kk];B[jl];W[sc];B[rf];W[sl];B[rk];W[ik]
C[The value of this move is microscopic compared to the lower left corner.]

;B[af];W[ag];B[ad];W[bh];B[hk];W[hj];B[ho];W[gn];B[hp];W[jr]
C[Unless this  is a very clever tesuji it should be too late now.]
;B[ks]LB[kq:a]C[Black is tricked. A move at  'a' instead kills White instantly.]
;W[kq];B[jq]LB[kp:a]C[Earlier on white 'a' could have been very strong move. But now Black is thick in this area.]

[mk][ok][lj][lk][ki][kj]C[White lost this game because almost every chance to start a good fight with the support of the white center thickness was lost. Looking at the final position it looks like white's strategy was to make a handful of territory in the center. Thickness that face  the center should be used to create territory elsewhere by attacking weak enemy groups or be used as support for invasions that destroy enemy territory or just by simply fighting. White should go through the game and look at every opportunity to attack the weak black stones in the center that was lost and try to learn how small the moves that was played really are.
  Professional always say (it does not matter if you are 30 kyu or amateur 6dan): "If you learn to evaluate the strength and weaknesses of groups you will become stronger, the rest is only technique."]
