C[eucmann: This is my first game submitted to be commented. There are probably many many mistakes.

tsjanl: Dear eucmann,

Thank you for sending this game. 

I have the impression that you are in that phase of your development where you know the basics of the game and don't make the big beginner mistakes, but where it is still very difficult to see where to play. After you get a better feel of some of the strategics aspects of the game, you can make a big improvement.

I will concentrate my review on the beginning of the game and some basic strategic elements, because I think there is the most for you to learn at this moment.]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[oc];W[fq]LB[pj:A]C[tsjanl: Here you have an essential choice. When black makes a corner enclosure, taking the extension point around A is a very good move. Making a corner enclosure from your own 3-4 stone can't be bad either.

There is a difference between black's and white's corner enclosure. Black's two point 'shimari' secures the corner, while white's three point shimare leaves some weak points.]
;B[qj]LB[oc:B][pj:A]C[tsjanl: A good move by black, because it is an extension from the corner enclosure.]
;W[nq]LB[dj:A][fq:B]C[tsjanl: Here I would prefer to play at A. An extension from a corner enclosure is almost always big. The extension from black's and white's enclosure are of equal worth (miai). When black gets his enclosure, white should take his, except when there would be a very big or urgent move elsewhere.

Your move is not so big, because B is low. There is not much to win at the lower side.]
;B[pn]LB[dj:A]C[tsjanl: Black could consider ignoring white's move and play around A.]
;W[kq]LB[jd:F][dj:A][jp:B][kp:C][nq:D][qq:E]C[tsjanl: This seems to be too timid. Firstly, A is still urgent. Secondly, if you would like to play at the lower side, B or C are better.

Firstly, they give a better alternation of 3- and 4th-line stones. Secondly, when black jumps jumps in between B/C and D, you can still invade at E.

Have a second look at your position: you have played four stones at the lower side, of which three are low. This means that you have claimed some territory, but you influence is not very great, especially because you haven't played A yet. You seem to be overconcentrated at the bottom.

Black on the other hand has a nice variation of stones on the third and fourth line. His only disadvantage is that he only has played at the right side. But he has the nice choice now between A and F (creating a double wing formation).]
;B[jd]C[tsjanl: Black's goes for the moyo game, establishing a big potential territory in the upper right.]

(;W[cf]LB[jd:B][cf:A][dj:C][ck:D]C[tsjanl: In general getting the shimari (A) and the extension (B) are miai (of equal value), but in this case playing C seems to be better. Black now can invade at D, greatly diminishing the worth of the white stones at the bottom.

See the variation.];B[ck]C[tsjanl: Perfect];W[di]LB[dc:G][hd:F]
[jd:B][oe:E][cf:D][ci:A][cm:C]C[tsjanl:

Locally: A is better than your move, because it prevents black slipping under your stone, thus putting more presure on black. Furthermor, because of B, you can't use the influence of your high played stone very well.

Beter do I like C. You are pushing the black stone to the solid stone D, giving black almost no chance of profit. Besides that, C is an extension from a shimari (although a small one). 

But I do think that playing on the left is not that important. Because the black stone can extend to two sides, there is not much to win by pressuring it.

On the right side, black is forming a huge moyo, something you can't do anymore on the right because of the black stone. It seems to me to be urgent to start playing there. E seems to be a good starting point.

Another possibility is F, which works nice with G and D and pressures B. Problem with this move is that it can help black in extending it's moyo.]
;B[cn];W[eo]LB[oe:D][di:C][dp:B][cq:A]C[Should I have make this move or attack at R13?

tsjanl: Firstly, your lower left corner is getting vunerable, for example for a black play at A. Your move doesn;t prevent that. A white move at B seems to be better. 

Maybe it is time to take some risk and play at D anyway.

R13 is not a good option: it is deep in the enemy area and it will get under strong pressure.]
;B[bi]C[tsjanl: that's why D11 was a bad move: the thing it should do, pressuring black, it fails to do.]
;W[dk]LB[hd:B][oe:A][el:C]C[tsjanl: Touching the black stones only strenghtens them. besides, there is not much to win anymore, now that black has settled himself.

A and B still seem to be good moves.];B[dl];W[ek];B[dm];W[el]
;B[em];W[fm];B[gc]LB[jj:A]C[tsjanl: Another idea is A: serving as a ladder breaker and closing the moyo.]
;W[jm]C[Another move that I'm very unsure about. I thought I had a good wall in the marked white stones so I played K7 trying to build up my moyo.

tsjanl: the problem is: black has far the bigger moyo. From now on, you are timidly playing along a border that gives black far more points than you. The only possibility to win is invading.]
;B[oj]C[tsjanl: this greatly reduces the possibility of an invasion.]
;W[li]LB[oj:A]C[Did I play this stone too aggresively?

tsjanl: Firstly: you played here far too late, especially now A is in place. The problem is that now you can't get farther in than were you played.]
;B[kk];W[lk]LB[mk:A]C[tsjanl: again, you are touching the stone you are attacking. In that way you make it stronger. A would be a better place to play.]
;B[kj];W[ki]LB[lj:A]C[tsjanl: Playing at A is needed. When black plays there, he get's nasty cutting points.]
;B[lj];W[jj];B[mj]C[tsjanl: Your attack on the three black stones has failed, now black connects them to his other stones.]
;W[jk];B[jg];W[hf]LB[kl:A][bo:D][qq:B][pr:C]C[I think I tend to dislike that idea that my opponent is ruining my framework so I'm trying to fend him off. But in the process I fail to stop my opponent from strengthing his framework.

tsjanl: yes, that is the price you pay. You should have invaded his framework much earlier.

The stone you played doesn't win a lot of territory. I've marked some alternatives.]
;B[ih];W[gh];B[ji];W[ii];B[jh]C[At this point I think I can no longer invade the top right and that area seems pretty secure for black.

tsjanl: I am afraid at this moment your game is lost.];W[kl]
;B[mk];W[ll]C[tsjanl: This stone is unimportant.];B[hi];W[ij]
;B[hh];W[gj];B[gi];W[fh]C[Should I have played in

tsjanl: you are touching the black stones every time. Because of that, black can crawl in.]
;B[hj];W[gk];B[ik];W[jl];B[hk]
(;W[hl];B[il];W[im];B[fi]TR[fl][gl][hm]C[tsjanl: Do you see the nasty cutting points, caused by playing too close at black stones?]
;W[ei];B[fj];W[fk];B[fe]LB[no:A][qq:B][pr:C]C[I think I should have played here the move before this one.

tsjanl: A, B and C are bigger.];W[ef];B[ee];W[de];B[gg];W[ff]
;B[gf];W[nn]C[tsjanl: good move!];B[or];W[nr];B[ml];W[mm];B[ol]

;W[ah]LB[bp:A]C[tsjanl: Your move is very small, A is very big.]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[co];W[cq];B[en];W[fn];B[do];W[dp]C[I think at this point area-wise I've already lost the game?

tsjanl: yes, you are right.];B[ak];W[ai];B[aq];W[ar];B[ap];W[bs]

(;B[bm]LB[dn:A]C[tsjanl: this is not needed, because black has an eye at A. See variation.]
;W[om];B[pm];W[nl];B[ok];W[nk];B[nj];W[nm]TR[ga][os]C[tsjanl: filling this only wins you a point. The triangled points are better.]
;B[fa];W[ea];B[ga];W[db];B[hm];W[gl];B[hn];W[os];B[qs];W[ej]
;B[on];W[ns];B[mo];W[ko];B[lm];W[tt]C[And I make the biggest blunder.

tsjanl: Well the game was lost anyhow. Resigning 40 moves ago would have been better. On the other hand, black should have simply finish the game, because he didn't need more to win.]
;B[no]C[tsjanl:

White loses the game, because he didn't recognize in time black was building a huge moyo, while he let his own moyo invade. 

A second problem of his game is that he tends to touch the stones he is attacking.

I hope you have enjoyed the review and will profit from it.
