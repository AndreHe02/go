C[My (black player) weakes spot seems to be my attitude and timing in game. In this game, my attitude wen't from desperate defence to determined attack. I think I lost this because I defended in wrong places.
I have had a long losing streak too!

This game was our second game. In first game I had good position to chase two weak groups but in end on of my chasers go captured. I think this prought some paranoia into this game.

So comment's on big picture and timing would be most appreciated. Of course if there is some important localities I have ignored, please point those to me.

Jay: This game turns out to be very complex in the end.  Here are some of my comments and judgements.  Your later half is fairly good.  If you can maintain such spirits throughout the game, even risk big losses, you will be a stronger player soon.]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ce];W[oc];B[mc]C[Is pincer durable strategy here? What kind of things I should take in account when planing pincer?

Jay:  pincer seems reasonable and natural.];W[oe]
(;B[qf]LB[oe:C][pf:A][qg:B]C[In gobase this wasn't covered in joseki dictionary so I guess I should have played A or B.

 I think that here I was scared about C. In our previous game I lost when opponent crushed my two space extension in third line.

Jay: The current move is ok.  My taste would be to play A, because it applies more pressure on W P15, and indirectly helps N17 stone.  A is also a standard joseki. See variation. R13 is certainly too lax, unless Q4 stone is B.  Then you would have to prepare to sacrifies R16 stone.]
;W[qb];B[rc]C[Jay: Not urgent, too small and heavy for B.  Somewhere at N15 is better.]
;W[og];B[jc];W[qh]C[So here start my desperate defence. I should be ok though, but opponent will gain strength. This whole course of play doesn't feel good for me. What wen't wrong?

Jay: This is because of the mistake at S17 earlier.  If you'v played N15, following W P13, You could'v played R12 and come out ahead.]

(;B[re]C[This place seemed dangerous. I think this was too cautious.

Jay: You may try something else.  The best defence is offense.]

;W[cm];B[ip]LB[jp:A]C[According to gobase, white played too far and black too close. If black had played A, what kind of dangers should be taken in account for future?

Jay: A is the normal play.  No danger.];W[lq];B[qq]C[How about timing for this move?

Jay: In order of preference: A>D>C>B.];B[ch];W[gd];B[hc];W[gc]
;B[hd]LB[ie:A]C[I played solidly to keep my top side group strong.]
;W[ge]
(;B[ee]C[This seems a bit weird now. I gues I tried to press white and increase my teritory.

Jay: This move is too small.  H15 to enlarge your right moyo (however small it is) and apply further pressure on the three W stones is better. I would even try H14 because B middle upper stones are over concentrated and stronge.  H14 will start your influence in the middle of the board.]
;W[he];B[id]C[And here I think I lose the game. I was so worried about my top side group, that I wen for empty triangle.]

Jay: W's LL corner has problems that you can exploit.  But, for now, does a ko in this area work here?  See variation.]

(;B[sb]C[Jay: This is definitely too small!!  B is already alive without T18.  If W T18, B will Q15, if W Q15, B will T18.  Even if W plays Q15 to capture the two B stones there. It's only 5 points.  But, B has bigger opportunity here. 

Now, it is B 's turn to mess with W LL corner.  The variations.]
;W[ed];B[dd];W[pf];B[cl]C[Jay: This B move has lost the final opportunity, see my earlier variations.  But, W made a mistake next, see criticisms on W's response.]

(;W[al]C[Jay: W's response at A8 is bad locally.  This allows B to seki and W loses a few points.  See the vairations.  But, at this point, there is no more opportunity for W to recover the earlier loses.  

No more comments from here on.];B[bo]C[Again, I feel like I am losing so decide to find a weakness.

Jay: Finally.];W[co];B[an];W[bn];B[ak];W[bm]LB[bp:A]C[For a moment I though I won, I expected opponent to play A to live in sente. This variation seems to be one point better to him though. Now game is close.]
