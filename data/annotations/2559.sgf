C[I'm a fairly new Go player, so even basic advice would be helpful.  The particular area I feel I played badly on is the fight for the lower middle region.  Thanks for any comments.]
;B[pc];W[cp];B[qo];W[dc];B[oq];W[jq]C[This is a good starting stone, since it is threatening, 
and its an extension from an existing stone, and since 
its on the third line it is good for creating territory.  
However beware of being cut between your two stones.];B[nr]
C[This stone was very slow and weak for black, there are 
so many bigger moves.];W[jd]LB[qe:A][qk:B][pm:C][cj:D]C[This stone is on the fourth line, which i've read is good 
for influencing stones rather then creating territory. 
Some other big moves are A, B, and C.  D would be 
a nice move to map out your territory (moyo i think the 
word is)];B[nj];W[dj];B[mc];W[me];B[ne];W[mg];B[jp]C[This fight in particular is where I feel like I lost control of what was going on.]
;W[kp]LB[ip:A]C[I think a stone at A would be better since your other 
stones are in that direction.];B[ko];W[jo];B[ip];W[hp]C[Your strategy here appears to be to capture the 
intruding stones.  This is not always possible and it 
would be better to instead block them from moving into 
 your area.];B[iq];W[jr];B[ir];W[hr];B[io];W[jn];B[hn];W[im]
;B[kq];W[lp];B[mo];W[lr];B[kr];W[lo];B[kn];W[ce]C[This stone was not needed right then, although it does 
secure that area more, you still have problems in the 
bottom.];B[lq];W[mq];B[js];W[ls];B[mr];W[km];B[ln];W[mp]LB[mn:A]
C[Perhaps a stone at A instead would have put that 
group of 3 into atari, and would also setup the black 
stone below A for an atari next round.];B[np];W[eq];B[hq];W[gq]
;B[gr];W[hs]C[In this case, it would be best to just cut your loses and 
prevent against further black expansion.];B[gs];W[dm]C[This stone makes that area less vulnerbale to 
invasion, however you still have not ended blacks 
most recent advance.];B[fq];W[fr];B[gp];W[dg];B[er];W[ds]LB[cr:xx]
[dr:A]C[This stone is in a bad position.  Perhaps A woulb have 
been better.];B[in];W[dr];B[fs];W[dp]LB[ep:A]C[This stone is slow and non-threatening, A would have 
been better.];B[fp];W[gd]C[This does defend your moyo more, but there are other 
areas to be worried about, this might even be a good 
time to place a stone on the right center side, behind 
the black stones.];B[jm];W[jk];B[kl];W[jl];B[lm];W[il];B[kk]
;W[ki];B[li];W[kj]LB[og:A]C[This is a good strategy to block black off. You also 
have a very nice in road to blacks hopeful territory at 
A.];B[lj];W[lg];B[ng]C[Now it will be harder to invade.];W[le]
;B[nd];W[lc];B[lb];W[kb];B[kc]LB[jc:A]C[At times it is best to sacrifice a stone. A stone at 
A would serve your purpose.];W[ld];B[jb];W[jc];B[ka];W[kd];B[ep]
LB[eo:A]C[Again, a stone at A would enclose black, and the 
capture of that white stone is not a big problem.];W[dq];B[en]
;W[dn];B[eo];W[gm];B[jj];W[ji];B[ij];W[hi];B[hk];W[hm];B[kh]
;W[ii];B[lh];W[jg];B[mh];W[gk];B[nf];W[hf];B[kg];W[pj]LB[qe:A]
[qg:B][qi:C]C[This is late coming since black has a nice wall on the 
left. Some better points of invasion might be A, B, or C. 
 The idea is to place your stone so you have enough 
space on one side to expand and creat two eyes.];B[qj];W[qi]
;B[ri];W[pi]LB[qk:A]C[you could have gone for the atari at A.  This would put 
black on the defensive and you in a better position for 
eye space.];B[oh];W[rj];B[qk];W[pk];B[rk];W[om]LB[qm:A]C[This stone is too high and black will just connect 
underneth, A would have been better.];B[pl];W[ol];B[ok];W[ql]
LB[pm:A]C[A would have been better, as it would contain the black 
stones instead of allow them to spread every 
whichway.];B[pm];W[qn];B[qm];W[pn];B[rl];W[rm]C[A direct connection would have been better.]
;B[rn];W[ql];B[oj];W[pm]C[This move was a misread...I thought this would give me life.  I realized my error on the next move.]

for black and white, i assume someone ended the 
game at this point. I think white still has a chance for 
life on the right side. Here are so Go Proverbs I find 
useful.

Lose your first 50 games.

Your best move is your opponents best move.

The third line is for territory, the fourth line is for 
influence.])
