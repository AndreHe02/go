C[This was a really short game. my opponent resigned soon into it. I only have a question about the first 10 moves. My opponent played a strange open game. I see this style every once and a while. He played what seemed like random moves. It was freaking me out. Would you mind giveing me a few pointers on how to deal with that type of open game?

R: the important concept to remember is not to follow your opponent around all the time. If he leaves weaknesses, sometimes just close your eyes and go for it, ignoring his next approach. I've shown examples of this in the review.]

Dont be afraid to play outside the box!];W[nc];B[pc]C[again, this is fine. But does feel abit like b is following white. Having said that, nothing wrong with this move so far.]
