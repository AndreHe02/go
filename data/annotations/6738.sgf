OT[5x30 byo-yomi]
RU[Japanese]

C[H: This was a fairly quick game I played on KGS (5m main time, 5x30s byo-yomi).  My opponent played some moves I wasn't entirely sure how to respond to early on.  Any tips, for black (things I could have done better) or for white (things I did that could have/should have been punished) would be greatly appreciated.  I will prefix all of my questions with "H:"

C: Chirality[1d\] here.  Mostly the opening was good for you, but you failed to get the most from your advantage by attacking white in the lower right.  Mostly, however, reading mistakes cost you very dearly in this game, and finally you lost the ko fight in the lower left... only white didn't notice. :)]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]LB[nc:B][mp:A]C[H: The Chinese opening is my favorite opening, I play it whenever I can.  I'm used to A and B as the common responses to this opening.]
;W[jp]C[H: This isn't a move I see often, so I wasn't sure what to do.  I think that my response was a good one.]
;B[jd]C[C: Yep.];W[qc]C[C: This must be too early.  This is good for you.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
;B[qf];W[dj];B[fc]LB[cn:C][po:A][lp:D][fq:B]C[C: I think this move is the wrong direction.  If I were white I would respond at A right away.  A is an OK move for black here, but I would consider, for example, B or C. (or D?)]
;W[cf];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do]LB[bn:B][co:A]C[H: I am not sure what the proper move in response to this is.  It seems a bit odd, not taking the hane here.

C: Just play A and be happy for the extra points.  B is good too.  You played too dangerously.]
;B[cn]LB[co:A]C[C: I've heard Yilun Yang 7p say that you need 4 liberties to jump.  Or is it 5?  Anyway, after white pushes at A you have only 3.]

(;W[dn]C[C: This is a thank-you move--white should probably cut right away--see the variation.]
;B[cm];W[co];B[bo];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[dr];W[er];B[jk]C[H: I was pretty sure that taking sente to create a large moyo would be a better choice than securing c2 immediately since the e3 cut isn't dangerous.

C: I agree.  But beware of trying to make territory with thickness.]
;W[ck];B[bk]LB[cr:A]C[C: Why not connect at A?  It's nice and big, and protects the cut.]
;W[bj];B[bl];W[cr];B[br];W[ds];B[bq]C[C: Move 45 is too early to play endgame moves.]
;W[po];B[qo]LB[np:A][mq:B]C[C: Don't attach to weak stones.  Play A or B and get ready to attack this stone on a big scale.  (you gave up the upper right corner for thickness, so you have to make sure you use it by attacking.)]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pm]LB[nn:A]C[H: This seems poorly placed.  I expected q4.

C: This is bad, but Q4 would be just terrible.  A is the move I would choose for white here.]
;B[ok]LB[ji:A][on:B][pn:C][np:D]TR[jp]C[C: White can easily destroy your potential territory with a move like A, so this move seems a little empty.  I would think about playing B.  If white responds at C, D becomes a great attack.

Letting white connect to the triangled stone can't be very good for you.]
;W[np];B[nq]LB[oo:A]C[C: Did you consider A instead?  Remember, the goal is to keep white separated.]
;W[mq];B[op];W[oo];B[no];W[mp];B[nn]LB[pp:1][oq:2][qq:3]C[C: Dangerous.  The 1-2-3 sequence is very worrying when white gets enough liberties.  White could even play it immediately and you would at the very least have a very difficult reading problem on your hands.]
;W[nm];B[on];W[om]LB[pn:A][pp:B]C[C: Maybe a mistake by white.  A instead would greatly complicate the situation for you.  As it is, you have already fixed the cut at B.]
;B[pn]TR[oo][po]C[C: This move is the wrong thinking.  These two stones are completely worthless.  You need to move your stones out and attack the whole white group.]
;W[mn];B[pp];W[lm]C[C: White is happy.];B[mk];W[kj];B[kk];W[lj]
;B[lk];W[jh];B[fe];W[ni];B[pi];W[og]C[C: White's getting a little overexcited here.]
;B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[nj];B[nk];W[li];B[ji]LB[hi:A][jj:B]C[C: Too close--white can run out easily.  A looks like a good move here, since you can play B in sente.]
;W[jj];B[ii];W[ij];B[kh]LB[cc:A]C[C: Why?  A is probably the biggest move.  The fight in the center is lost.]

Working problems will be the best to help your reading, and I also recommend a book like Attack and Defense, or some of the audiogolessons.com lectures, to learn more about attacking strategies.

Take care!])
