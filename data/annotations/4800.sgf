AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi

I will try to emphasize the important moves and, as much as possible, to depict some alternatives. Also, I will focus on Black moves, but on White's too when it is about something relevant.
My comments will start with R.

I hope you'll enjoy it
Radu

Hi,
This game was played by my with a feeling that he is much better than I, but ,I think, he allowed me to do too much influence and moyo.
I would be greatful for comments of the direction of my play in fuseki mainly and about my responds in center, but also any opinion which moves are good or bad too.
Big  thanks for review.
Paul];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb]
(;B[qc]C[R: it is not required, as r14 is in place.
Having q14 instead would require defensive r17.
Although r17 is not a mistake, the sente could be used better.]
;W[kc];B[hc]LB[gc:C][qj:B][jp:A]C[R: too far, g17 looks better. Also, k4 is more important.]
;W[qn]
(;B[nq]C[R: Hmmmm, it is a matter of taste. But B already has power in right up corner. Use it!]
;W[qh]C[R: W sees that!];B[qj]C[R: good!];W[pj]LB[qb:A][of:B]
C[I didn't know what I should do here. Maybe Q12 would be better?
R: this capping move is too close. Hane!
Q12 would be the same mistake as W: too close, forcing opp to reinforce. B corner group has the miai of r18 / p14]

(;B[qi]C[R: Don't play in contact with the opp stones, this is a general saying. R12 is already blocking you.]
;W[pi];B[rh]C[R: good.];W[ph];B[ql]C[R: r11-10 looks bad because r12. r8 doesn't help much, this leaves potential bad aji behind.]
;W[qk]C[R: W sees again. Now the r11 moves is pulling B back.]
;B[rk];W[pk];B[pl];W[rl]C[Again here, what would be the best for black?
S10, T9 or S13?
R: Hard to say, depends in the further plans. At a first sight, s10, but this has also drawbacks. Because a second B group (q8) is weak. B started this exit, should continue it: p8.]

(;B[rm];W[rj];B[sl]CR[on]C[But overall this position isn't bad for black, I think.
R: B still needs a capping move for r6.];W[ri]
(;B[qg]C[R: correct defense is s13. B needs space for eyes.]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[sh];B[og]C[R: choosing between the miai points, I would go for r18. It also threats W group. Moreover, the correct escape move is p14, or even o15]
;W[pg];B[pf];W[of];B[oe];W[nf];B[ne]C[R: now, r18 is vital, as the center exit is not obvious.]
;W[me];B[ng]C[R: wrong. W is alive on wright and up side. The B stones are in a very bad situation. Don't make them more valuable than they deserve it.]
;W[mf];B[jp]C[R: r18!];W[nd]C[Is it bad move to leave the corner? Maybe not yet?
R: this was an invating move to live in corner. Also, this move is wortheless, you couldn't escape to center that way.]
;B[ch];W[cc]C[R: Hmmmm, again W invites B to build strong position. Wrong move, f16 would worth more.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb]C[R: Good sequence. I would play g17 instead, but it is ok.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[cf]C[R: W has e16 cutting pont. Because you didn't play g17, you should connect instead making eye shapes (c15).
The W corner invasion did what actually B wanted: now the B is having so much influence that W has to start worry.]
;W[ba]C[R: hmmmm, what for?];B[da]C[R: W is living!];W[db]
(;B[cl]C[R: again, to large move. See alternatives. r18?];W[qb]
C[R: oooops ;)]
(;B[oc]C[R: Let's see if B can survive. I think it is possible, but not with this move.
Anyway, the situation is so complicated because of loosing the miai: exit to center or take the corner.]

(;W[ob]C[R: hope for B.]
(;B[fq]C[Now, I dicided to leave top-right corner, because I estimated, that my position and influence in bottom and left side are quite big.
And if I would defend top-right group, I might lose my positon there.
Can the top-right group be defend with one move? ( S16? )
R: usually, you don't let a such group to die. Esp. when there are chances. The situation is very complicated, but it deserves a try.
OTOH, the extension is correct, but you also could consider g3.]
;W[re];B[dn]CR[kh]C[R: overcrowded. Jump to center, possible using p13 as aji]

(;W[od]C[R: no need anymore!]
(;B[ho]C[R: too small! W consummed 2 moves to kill, so B had 3 opportunities! I would say that was deadly for W, even B didn't obtain the maximum]
;W[pe]C[R: come on!!! Is the second move of W which has no meaning...]
;B[mo]LB[if:A][kh:D][lk:C][ml:B]C[R: far to small. It is very hard to pick the right center move. I would go for j14, n7 or m9.]
;W[ee]C[R: aim is e16. It is used as aji... W spotted well.]
;B[ef];W[fe];B[ff];W[ge];B[gf];W[hf];B[hg]C[R: h15 instead?]
;W[if]C[If I would play at E16, my F17 group was safe. But it gave him a chance to invade to the center, which would be very hard to stop.
R: For center it is neded 4 walls. Even W makes 2 (up and right), B has the other 2. That means the influences are balanced. Moreover, B has stronger position.  But on upper side there are over 30 points.
Don't count to much on center. They say: in center you have always fewer points that you counted on.]
;B[ig];W[ed];B[de];W[jg]C[R: Should protect h15 cutting point!]
;B[jh];W[kg];B[kh];W[gj]C[I didn't know how to respond here.
R: you are now quite ahead, but still you have some aji there: g13, j12... These have to be protected.
W is trying to recover, B is needing only to keep W in a sand box.]
;B[ij]C[I dicided to cut white off from possibility of expantion to right.
R: correct, and protect j12.];W[ii];B[jj]C[R: Hmm, maybe h11 would work better. B has to quickly cover the ajis. Even allowing j11 escape, it is not so bad.]
;W[hi];B[gh]C[R: good!];W[ji];B[ki];W[kj];B[kk];W[lj]
(;B[lk]C[R: k10 are looking ugly, but j12 is vital];W[mj]C[I knew that if I want to save L12 group, I had to connect at J12, but I didn't know which moment is right.
If I played now at J12, I might gain more, because white wouldn't be able make two eyes round F9 and would be cut off from rest.
Is it right?
R: in fact, W already missed j12 once!];B[mk];W[ih];B[he]C[White had connected but I found, I think, good respond. I've invaded beeply in white's moyo.]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[id];B[jf]C[R: W answered correctly. And W did more damage: B took around 15 points, W 40.]
;W[gd];B[kf];W[lg];B[jd];W[ic];B[jc];W[ib];B[kd]C[R: small move, but keeps the sente. Good.]
;W[lc];B[ld]LB[ej:C][nj:B][hl:A]C[R: this doesn't threat enough!]
;W[nk]C[R: I think a sacrifice would work here.]

[bs][cs][ds][fs][gs][hs][is][js]C[Black wins by 8,0 points.
R: Overall, I would say this game was a really good game. Both player showed solid basic knowledges. The routines are well formed, so quickly your rank should grow accordingly.
As for Black, I would suggest little more attention of the aji left behind. Sometimes they are not obvious, like an immediate threat, but using more stones the situation could get really complicated. And it is not worthing, when safe easy moves are available. Cutting points and hane moves are often deadly.

Have good plays, Radu])
