C[Hello! Thank you for reviewing my game. I've been playing go for around 3 months since my suitemate in college got me interested. I played white here. Though I won by resignation, there must be many moves I made that are inadequate. Please let me know better moves that I could have made through the game. Sometimes I'm not sure where the largest point on the board is, whether in fuseki or middlegame. Also, sometimes I feel like I don't know how to attack something like a two-space third line extension when I am strong in the area. Please let me know what I could have done better; not only the crucial moves that I missed or when I could have tenuki'ed, but also moves that could use general improvement. Again, thank you for reviewing my game, I hope to learn more about go.

;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq]C[I saw this sequence before, and knew how to punish black for ignoring joseki.]
;W[bq];B[bp];W[ep];B[eo];W[fp];B[dn];W[fq];B[er]C[Carey: There is no way to escape from this.  Extending here is a wasted move.  See variants]

(;W[dr]C[Perhaps I should have extended on the other side for more influence.]

(;B[gr];W[fr];B[hq];W[qn]C[I wasn't sure here where to tenuki to. I ended up approaching the lower right hoshi stone with a low knight. Perhaps there was a better move out there?]
;B[pn]C[Carey: I think this is one of the better moves in this situation]
;W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[qp];W[qj]C[I feel like this choice of joseki benefited him more than it benefited me. Perhaps there is a better sequence.]
;B[mc]LB[mq:A]C[Carey: Tenuki here is not good.  White can easily invade at A and either make life or escape and put pressure on your separated groups.  He could also push at B and cause all sorts of problems. A for black is mandatory here.]

(;W[qg];B[pb];W[qc];B[qb];W[po]LB[jc:A][cg:B]C[This is a trick play I read somewhere. Luckily black fell for it.

Carey: Since Black does not have N3, a push with White Q5 is a good move.  However, it's a little premature.  There are still a lot of points to be made in the top left.  White can put pressure on black with A (preferred), or make some solid points with B.]
;B[oo];W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq];W[mp];B[mq];W[om];B[mn]C[Carey: Jump doesn't work]
;W[nn];B[lp];W[gc]LB[kc:A]C[Again, I wasn't sure where to tenuki. Perhaps this move was too vague. Not sure where else to have gone, though.

Carey: I think A would of been better because it puts pressure on black's weak group, but the fact that you ignored M4 rather than responding is a good first step.]
;B[cg];W[ce]LB[eg:A]C[Carey: This is a very slow move.  It is almost a thank-you move with black following up with A and taking large territory on the side..]
;B[dj];W[eg]LB[kc:A]C[Too slack?

Carey: I'm not quite sure what the point of this move is.  A would have been a good solid 10 points and put pressure on black.   Remmeber, corners first, then sides, then center.  This move is premature.]
;B[mo];W[no];B[ic]C[Now black took the points because he didn't have to respond to white's E13.]
;W[kc]C[This attack may have been premature; however I felt I was stronger in the area than black.

Carey: This was a good attack, at the right time.  You can either separate black's two weak groups or you can let him live small underneath and take some great center influence.]
;B[jd];W[ld]C[Carey: Good response, keep him separated.];B[md]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[jc];B[hb];W[id];B[hc];W[je];B[hd];W[ie];B[fc]
;W[dc]LB[gd:A]C[Carey: I'm not sure this is requried.  I would of played at A and put pressure on black's group.  He would of had to respond.]
;B[gd];W[kb]C[Carey: I would of saved this for a Ko threat]
;B[ia];W[me];B[le]LB[lf:A]C[Carey: Not a good move by black, A captures easy.]
;W[ne]LB[ke:B][lf:A]C[Carey: Black should definitely play A next, to keep pressure on white's group with one, possibly zero eyes (if black can play at B)]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[rc];W[rd];B[sb];W[oc];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb];W[nd]
;B[lc]
(;W[kd]C[Carey: Wrong move for white.  See variant.  Black is dead.]
;B[lb];W[rp]LB[la:A]C[Carey: Play A first.  Sente and protects black connecting underneath]
;B[rq];W[mm]C[Too slow? Maybe there is a bigger move out there.]
;B[lm];W[ll];B[oi]C[Here black tries to invade; when someone does it like this it is very annoying.

Carey: Really?  It's not annoying to me.  I love it!  Black CLEARLY has no room to live here.  Just contain him and he won't get any eyes.  You get to be on attack for the rest of the game.  How can that be annoying? :)]
;W[mi]C[Carey: Good first move.  Now just stay solid.];B[mg]
;W[nh];B[ni];W[mh];B[oh];W[ng];B[og];W[mj]LB[nj:A][nk:B]C[Carey: This move is a little slow .  Try A or B instead.]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[lk];W[kl];B[mk]
(;W[kj]LB[ln:A]C[Carey: what's wrong with double atari at A?  See variants]
;B[kk];W[jk]LB[oh:A]C[Carey: This is spreading very thin, bad shape here.  There is no way to keep him from escaping, I would just make sure that the four stones at A don't get to connect up and minimize damage.]
;B[jj];W[jl];B[lj];W[ki];B[li];W[lh];B[kh];W[ji];B[nf]
(;W[of]LB[mf:A]C[Carey: Double atari at A better.  See variant.]
;B[nj];W[lg];B[ok];W[nk];B[nl];W[ol];B[nk];W[pj]C[Carey: Good, solid eye-killing move.]
;B[qh];W[rh]LB[rg:A]C[Carey: A is better.  He's struggling for life.  You need to stay solid.]
;B[qf]LB[rg:A]C[Carey: If you had played at A, this wouldn't of even been an option for black]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[qi];B[pk]C[Carey: White can ignore this move.]
;W[qk];B[oe];W[mf];B[re];W[sd];B[rg];W[pf]C[Here is a very big mistake I made. I played this move too quickly without thinking.

Carey: Yes :)  Just fill in Ko, black still dead.];B[qh];W[pi]
;B[ri];W[qg];B[pe]C[Carey: Not a ko threat!  It's a snapback for white.  White should of filled Ko!  See variant.]

(;W[nf];B[qh];W[sh];B[si];W[qg];B[qe];W[qh]C[I think I had good control of this game. However, I'd still like to know what areas I need improvement in. Thanks for reviewing my game! Your comments are very helpful!
- Jeremy W

Carey: No problem.  The biggest improvements you can make right now, at your level, are you in your openings.  Not all beginning moves need to be responded to.  Extending 2-3 spots on the third or fourth line can be worth 10-20 points.  So think about that the next time you consider responding to your opponent on the small scale.  It's best to step back after every move and look at the WHOLE board.  Read out what direction a local battle will push you.  When you invade, think about how easy it is for you to escape compared to how easy it is for your opponent to escape.  I know you've probably heard this all before, but just concentrate a little more on it and you'll improve :)

Last but not least, don't get irritated when an opponent makes an overplay.  You should revel in it!  You should look at the overplay and think to yourself "Woohoo!  That just cost him the game!!  Now I get to make him suffer!" :)  As you can see, that one single overplay cost him the entire game; he got nervous because of your moyo.  Rather than throw a stone in an impossible invasion, he should of just tried to get his own big moyo.]
