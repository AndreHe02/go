C[i would like black's game to be reviewed];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp]
;W[dd];B[op];W[jd]C[It is rare, but not impossible, for white to open a sanrensei (3 star point stones on one side).  This is usually black's perogative.]

(;B[pj]C[Extremely good direction of play here.  Extending from the corner enclosure below is a high priority when the opponent permits it.  As to the specific point of play, I prefer one line closer to the edge--as it balances with the corner enclosure more efficiently and threatens an ideal one-point jump forming a boxlike moyo.  See variation.]
;W[jq]C[white makes the splitting move, allowing him a 2-space extension in either direction]
;B[lq]C[good response.];W[gq]LB[dj:A][cj:B][dm:C][cm:D][cg:E]
C[These are possibilities that come to mind for me for black's next move instead of the contact move that was played.  A  or B (D10 or C10) seem nice, as they balance/work best with Q10.  If white next jumps into the corner at C3, black intercepts on the outside, building strength directed at the white group on the bottom, not with the intention of capturing the white stones, but jumping out from M3 and building a truly huge black territory on the right.  If white slides toward the corner with D3 or E3, black defends the corner calmly.  If black absolutely wants to respond on the bottom, D3 is probably best, although white will likely then approach the open corner from the other side.]
;B[fq]C[Always consider carefully before you make a contact move--especially during the fuseki.  How will the opponent respond?   The standard response is to push straight up, thus furthur stabilizing the  white group.  Although the desired (meaning most efficient)extension from a two stone wall is three spaces, and thus white is forced into a narrower space than desired, white is not too dissatisfied, since the aim for white here in the first place was not to make territory but to limit black's territory.  In addition, the attaching stone is immediately weakened by white's response.  Furthermore, this contact doesn't achieve anything, as the corner remains open anyway.  Black is best off not making this contact play.

This is not to say contact plays are wrong--many times they are desirable in order to settle one's self, or to force overconcentrated, inefficient shape, or to nudge the opponent in a certain direction.  See suggestions for other possible plays at discussion of previous move.]
;W[gp];B[kr]C[Black really cannot hope to capture white here.  Again, this shoulder hit, which is the next thing to a contact move, helps white more than black.  M2 would be far better for black than this.  M5 better still.  Frequently, the most aggressive moves approach but do not touch the opponent.]
;W[jr];B[gr]C[See previous comments about contact and shoulder plays.  Black appears to be either trying to capture white, which should not be possible, or worrying about white making territory--a whole 4 points of it!  Black has huge moves elsewhere, much larger than any territory white can make here.]
;W[hr];B[fs]C[Make the solid connection at F2, not the hanging connection here.  This leaves E2 as a threat, especially a ko threat, for white later on.  When you make a connection, consider the solid connection first, and come up with some good reason why a solid connection is not the best in the specific instance before you make another form of connection.]
;W[fp]C[This is natural by white, and quite painful for black, but follows from the contact play at F3.]
;B[eq];W[cn]
(;B[do]C[No, this absolutely must be at C4!  See variation]

(;W[co]C[White lets black off the hook, by forcing black to defend the corner after all.  White should push up at d6 with sente against the corner and then C10 or D10 is huge.  See variation.]
;B[cp];W[ck]C[A very good play by white.  The best response in the local situation probably.  D6 would seal black in the corner, but the three white stones are then heavy.]
;B[ch]LB[qf:A][nd:B][md:C][fd:D][gd:E][nc:F][fc:G]C[Not a good place to invade.  White is stable below and this invasion induces a nice chunk of territory for white above.  There is not room for black to extend in either direction here.  A-G are all better, A, B and C the best, since q16 is the upper right corner is white's weakest area.]
;W[cf];B[cj]
(;W[dj]C[In my opinion, a misplay by white.  See variation.]
;B[di];W[bj];B[ci];W[bi];B[ej];W[dk];B[bh];W[ek];B[cg]C[B12, C12, C13 make the "empty triangle" shape--which is very heavy and inefficient.  Black's whole group here is quite heavy, but that is a product of invading the wrong spot.]
;W[bf]
(;B[fj]C[much too slow, black needs to jump out lightly.];W[fk]
C[slow, unneeded move by white, too];B[df];W[de]C[C16 defends better.  These four stones form a bad shape, vulnerable at C16]
;B[ef]
(;W[ee]C[This time, an empty triangle by white];B[ff];W[fe]
;B[qg]C[Good direction of play.];W[qm]
(;B[ql]C[A go "proverb" to remember: contact moves are usually for defense, noncontact moves are for attack.  You are definitely the one on the attack here, as well you should be, thus, you do not want to touch white at all with this move.  The correct move is R9 (see variation for possible continuation).]
;W[pm]
(;B[om]C[Not possible to hold him in, normally, so this is also incorrect.  see variation.]
;W[pl];B[qk];W[ol];B[nm];W[ro]C[Mistake by white.  Another go proverb :).  Run before making eye shape.  In other words, escape to the center before diving to a very small side.  This side is all endgame moves and only gets white one eye.]

;B[nl];W[ok];B[on];W[pn];B[mc];W[kc]C[Note that white doesn't touch black.]
;B[me]
(;W[mg]C[White cannot hope to hold black in, so this is pointless.  Black can escape one way or the other.  See suggestion for alternative.]

;B[mm];W[kp];B[lp];W[ko];B[ln]C[If black merely limit's white in the upper right, he will win this game.  The upper right should not be left by either player.]
;W[lo];B[mo];W[kn];B[kl];W[im];B[hj];W[gk];B[gj];W[hk];B[en]
;W[fn];B[em];W[fm];B[fo]C[Why not the upper right before many of these small moves?   This move in particular hurts, because it hands sente back to white--that is, once white blocks, black must connect at either E5 or D6.]
;W[go];B[eo];W[dm]C[White hands sente back to black.  This secures at most four points.  Almost any move in the upper right is worth more than 10.]
;B[jf];W[hd]C[A gote move by white but worth it, if the upper right were decided.]
;B[he];W[ge];B[gf];W[ie];B[hf];W[if];B[ig];W[ke];B[kf];W[oc]
C[Black still can win with the variation.]
(;B[je];W[id];B[le];W[ld];B[md];W[re]C[This wins the game for white.  Black actually outplays white in the yose (endgame), gaining back some of the difference and nearly overtaking white.  But white's 20 points here are too much to overcome]
;B[qe];W[qd];B[rf];W[rd];B[pe];W[nb];B[mb];W[oi];B[pi];W[kh]
C[can see this attack was obviously a major problem, but cant see  how to defend better

Don't.  Tenuki instead.  k19 is bigger now.  All the black stones here will link either to the right or left, both of which are alive.

However, the second variation is a suggestion.]
(;B[lg];W[lh];B[ik];W[ih];B[jh];W[ji];B[jg];W[ii];B[ki];W[kj]
;B[jj]
(;W[lj]C[The rest is yose--both sides make some mistakes in yose, but black plays better in the endgame.

The main point to take from this game is to refrain from making contact plays automatically.  You can frequently predict the opponent's response to a contact play, and if the response helps the opponent more than the contact helps you, look for another play.

The secondary point is that when stones ARE in contact and you are fighting back and forth, you can get caught up in the fight such that you keep playing unnecessary moves when you could be making much larger moves elsewhere.  My suggestion here is to say to yourself "Ok, I am in a fight right now, but is this move needed or am I merely playing here because my opponent keeps playing here?"  The move is needed if your's stones life isn't assured and you can't afford to lose the stones.  If the group will live or if you can lose those particular stones but gain better profit elsewhere in exchange, consider playing elsewhere.

The secondary point is actually more important globally, but for improvement in the short term, thinking critically about contact plays is useful.

In looking back through this, it occurs to me that the game commentary seems overly critical.  In fact, black's instincts look quite good--it is a matter of focusing on the points above and fine-tuning the specifics for improvement.  Think big rather than small!
