C[ZD: This was a fairly calm game I played on KGS.  I am black and I lost by quite a lot in the end (11,5 pts without komi). I made a mistake that cost me a lot of points on move 63, and the sequence around 105 also was not good, but probably there were other mistakes that I missed that contributed to the result. Any suggestions how I could have achieved a better result are appreciated.  I will mark my remarks and questions with ZD.

Forfun (hereafter "ff"") - This is an interesting game.  In the early going I felt that Black needed to assess the situation more calmly.  In even games, Black has the advantage of the first move.  This advantage consists of having more stones on the board and therefore being able to direct the shape of the early game.  Here Black scattered his early efforts and lost coordination between his stones.  Black seemed to want to achieve too many things at once.  This is not possible when the opponent is of equal strength.  We always have to keep in mind that if we play in a certain way, not only will we gain in a certain area of the board but our opponent will inevitably gain somewhere else.  This is the natural result of playing turn by turn.  Therefore we have to accept that in certain areas of the board we will have to play in situations where locally we are at a disadvantage.  In this game I felt that Black did not want to accept that fact and tried too hard to get around it.  Black's game will improve by understanding when the situation favors aggressive play and when it requires a more conservative approach.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq]
(;B[ci]C[ff - This is an unusual choice.  It would be interesting to know what Black expected with this play.

Basically when the D17 and D3 stones face each other like this there is relatively little opportunity for White to build a large framework on the left side.  The two stones are too low with respect to the side.  White plays this way intending to keep the corner territory at top and bottom.  Therefore Black normally chooses to approach one or the other corner rather than split the side like this.  See the variations...]
;W[od]
(;B[pf]C[ff - This play seems too mild and oriented toward the right side.  If Black wants to build on the right, then the C11 stone should have been played at P17 or P16 in the first place.  This situation demands a pincer.  See the variations...]
;W[cf]C[ff - The exchange of Q14 for C14 changes the balance of power on the upper side.  The White stone on P16 now seems like an extension from a White shimari in the upper left.  Meanwhile it is not clear whether the White stone on P16 or the Black stone on C11 is the weakest point on the board.]

(;B[do]LB[mc:C][cl:A][cn:B][jp:D]C[ZD: it might have been better to play A (expecting w to follow up with B, after which I would tenuki, either around C or D)

ff - The exchange of Black 'A' for White 'B' would allow White to enclose both corners.  This was White's original intent on the left.  Nevertheless, Black 'A' would leave Black with a stable group and sente to return to the right.  The play at D5 is an invitation to White to invade the 5-space Black extension.  We see that the Black play at C11 was too close to the upper left (see notes on variation to C11) and also (naturally) too far away from the bottom left.]
;W[dl]C[ff - This is a hard blow for Black.]
(;B[eq]LB[ci:C][dl:A][cq:B]C[ZD: I cannot attack A, so jumping out does not seem appealing.  Going to corner with B would leave white with two groups to attack (B and C), which I did not like, either.

ff - This does not seem like a natural continuation from here.  However, directly answering the pincer does not seem to work so well either.  See the variations...]

(;B[kc]LB[lc:A][mc:B][po:C]C[ZD: This move was slack.  I should have either attacked more severly with A or B, or take C.

ff - The high play at P16 is light by nature.  It is difficult to attack it severely with any low play.  See the variations.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[rb]C[ff - Usually this is only played when Black already has a stone on the the right side.  There is a danger here that White will attack at R12 in sente later.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[le]
(;B[gc];W[po];B[qm]C[ZD: Maybe some other pincer would be more suitable?  I am not too familiar with the variations for other pincers than this one, though.]
;W[qq]
(;B[qp]LB[od:A]C[ZD: The variation looks possible (especially since it weakens A group), but from some reason I did not like it in the game.]

(;B[lp]C[ff - This is a strange play.  The lower left Black position is extremely strong.  Any extension in front of it will tend to be overconcentrated.]
;W[om];B[ol]LB[pk:A]C[ZD: A looks too submissive to me, although maybe more solid.]
;W[nl];B[ok];W[no]LB[mb:A]C[ZD: I am trying to attack the upper right group, and fix the weaknesses in my right side in the progress.  I should have probably taken the base with A first.

ff - Agreed.  The slide at N18 is fundamental.  It not only undercuts White but it stengthens Black.  Since Black wants to invade the upper left, it is important whether Black plays N18 or White descends at M17.]
;B[jf];W[lc]
(;B[lg]C[ff - Because White has strong stones at D8 and O9 this does not seem too effective.]

(;B[di]C[ff - This is a poor play by Black.  White's answer closes off the left side, whick becomes White's largest territory.  Meanwhile the Black stone at D11 does not significantly strengthen the stones here.  See the variation...]

;W[if]
(;B[ih]LB[ji:A]C[ZD: A might be better, but the variations are still complicated.

ff - As shown by the many variations that you included here the situation is complex.  I do not think 'A' is clearly superior to the game.  I think that the bigger issue is Black's next play...]
;W[jg]
(;B[jh]C[ff - This looks like an error, Black should be careful to maintain the connection between the top and the right...]
;W[kg];B[lh];W[id];B[ic];W[hd];B[hc];W[ke]C[ff - A major disappointment for Black.  The wall across the center is difficult to use because White's stones at D8 and O9 are very solid.]
;B[fb];W[lr]C[ZD: Now the game is probably lost.  I tried to make some points in the center, but W's positions are too strong for that

ff - Fundamentally it is almost impossible to make territory in the center since you have to close it off from four directions while you opponent only has to enter it from one :-)  In addition, it is almost certain that your opponent will also make some territory close to yours as a natural result of playing stones to limit your potential.

If we look at what happens in this game, Black begins with a loss on the left (see notes to Black B6 at move 117) and ends up with about 12 points in the center.  Meanwhile White builds about 15 extra points in the bottom right.  Black's net loss in the center is almost equal to White's margin of victory!]
;B[rr]C[ff - Good psychology! :-)  After M2 White will almost certainly answer this.]
;W[pr]
(;B[bn]C[ff - This is not a good idea.  Black does not have to sacrifice here.  See the variation...]
;W[dn];B[en];W[dm];B[qk]C[ff - A very big play since it threatens to cut at O10...]

(;B[ld]C[ff - Something like this seem necessary to make sense of the stones played so far.  If the attack on C11 by the White play at C14 is more urgent than exploiting Whites' tenuki in the upper right, then Black should not have played Q14!]

(;B[ld]C[ff - This play feels better to me.  If we look across the whole board, this Black pincer cuts off the White stone on P16 from the upper left corner.  In addition, it reaches out loosely to the Black stone on C11.  Black's stones are better coordinated while White's are all separated.  White's stone o P16 seems surrounded by all four Black stones played so far.]

;W[od];B[de]C[ff - Black has the option to approach the upper left in response to White's play at P16.  This is not available in the game because when the Black stone is on C11 instead of C10, it is too close to the stone on D15.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc]C[ff - White can not make Black overconcentrated here.]
