AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hello, this is one of my games against the computer and i think i did really bad. I'm wondering if you can give me some pointers on how to improve and strengthen my game :) thanks!

>It's good that you think you did badly even though you won the game. Some general comments: think about the purpose of your moves. "Play away from strength". Look for moves that develop you and constrain your opponent, rather than each of you playing independently of each other. Don't reply to every move your opponent makes: that's too passive. Think instead how much you lose if you don't reply and whether you can gain at least that much elsewhere. This is called "mutual damage". Play at the edge beween your sphere of influence and your opponent's sphere of influence.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[ch]SQ[cf]CR[ck][dk]C[ok, should I have cut?

>Cut? I don't see any white connected white stones. I guess you mean "invaded" (at the marked points). I don't think so. I think pressing at C14 is not out of the question.]

(;B[fd]SQ[gd][cf]C[Was this move too small? could i get away with g16?

>The rule of thumb is that the optimal extension from N stones leaves N+1 empty spaces. In this case, from 1 stone, 2 empty spaces (to G16). Don't be afraid of white's cut, there isn't one. I still like C14 better than G16, but it's a matter of taste. Ask yourself what you want to achieve with your move and which move achieves that goal better.]
;W[bp]
(;B[cp]CR[cq]C[>Huh?];W[hc];B[fc]CR[dd][fd]C[>You are overconcentrated.]
;W[bq]C[>This is why C4 is bad.]
(;B[cf]CR[lc][ck][dk]C[>Even more overconcentrated. Besides, you are approaching white from your strong side. There is a proverb: play awas from strength. You could play at any of the marked points instead. See the variations.]
;W[kc]C[>This ideal extension should and could have been avoided.]
;B[nc]CR[mc]C[>What are you afraid of?];W[qn];B[nq];W[rp];B[qq]
;W[qk]
(;B[kp]SQ[qg][ck][dk]C[>How about R13? It is better to harass your opponent a little than to allow both of you to develop without risking a fight. When you harass your opponent you are gaining some and taking some away. When each of you go about your business independently, both gain!]
;W[ck];B[bh]SQ[qg]C[>2nd-line plays are best left for the endgame. R13 is bigger.]
;W[bg];B[cg];W[qf]C[>This is what R13 prevents.];B[qe];W[pf]
;B[pi];W[bi]TR[kc][pf][qf][qk]CR[pi]C[>Now you've lost B12, too. The reason your move is not too threatening is that white can escape in two directions.]

[pf][qf]CR[md][le][qh][qi]C[>The marked points might be better alternatives, putting some real pressure on the marked white stones. M15/N16 seem better because that threatens two weak white groups. The bottom-right group is strong.]
;W[pe];B[qd];W[cc]C[I was pretty suprised that white did this... could white actually survive?

>If you don't reply, yes. At this point it's a little late, but it must try anyway, since it's one of the bigger points on the board.]

C[at this point is white weak anywhere? how bout black? Should i be focusing on influence for the center right now or strengthening my stones?

>There is only one weak white group (marked), if you cut it from the upper group, it has nowhere to go and may die, but the cut is harder than it was a few moves back. Black is strong. At this point you should count the score, too.]
