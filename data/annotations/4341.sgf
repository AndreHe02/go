C[Hello, thanks for reviewing.  I'm black in this game.  This is a friendly game I played not on the internet, so I dont remember the entire game.  I remembered most of the beginning and middle game though.  Some moves may be a little out of order, but most moves should be in the right order.

Thanks for reviewing!

If you can remember your moves like this, that is a good step. At least, thats what a dan level player told me once. It makes sense because in order to remember the moves they have to have meaning for you.

I cannot really criticize your moves much. They are good enough to win the game. Most important, you make a crucial invasion on left at the right point in the game.]

I agree. The monkey jump would be big in the endgame, but now you have bigger fish to fry. A seems like a good move for the way it works with your position on the right.]

;B[ra];W[sa];B[sb];W[op];B[pp];W[sa];B[fq]C[I decided to try and make a large bottom moyo.

I like this plan, but it is balanced against the relative weakness of you stones in the upper right.]
;W[qb];B[cn]C[
This is a good local move, but hind sight is making me wonder if you should play somewhere on the top instead.]

;W[cq];B[go];W[fr];B[gr];W[er];B[hq]C[I guess I got what I wanted, but white's corner is larger than I wanted it to be.

Not as large as your bottom side. This seems like a good exchange for you.]

I would probably have just connected at A. However, I see some merit in the fight for initiative here.]
;W[lf];B[kc];W[lc];B[lb]C[some of the moves in this area may be out of order, but the final shape is correct.]

;W[df];B[ic]C[
W has comes out better in this exchange. He gets the big move at D14 while b leads a group with a small life into the center.]
;W[hc];B[id];W[ie];B[hd];W[gb];B[he];W[if];B[hf]C[I'm just looking for some influence here so that I can invade the left side.  Killing the center group would have been nice, but I wasn't really trying to do it.

This is a good plan. You are not letting w get a big area like you have at the bottom.]
;W[hg];B[cf]C[I thought this would give me the best chance to connect outside.]

The more I look at this game, the more I appreciate this move. If white played here instead of trying to kill your invasion, he would be much better off.]

Like you say later, w gambles on a ko and loses. w has a fighting chance if he runs into the center to try to get eyes for his group on the left side.]

Thanks for reviewing!])))
