C[yip [5k?\]: Hello.

I'd figured I'd try something completely different in this game, by starting out playing in the center.  I tend to be very aggressive in my games, and thought that it would be interesting to see how the fighting developed.

As it turned out, we each lost a large group, and the game was extremely close.  I feel that I (B) probably should have lost, but was lucky in the end.

The questions I have involve using influence.  Obviously B starts with lots of influence, and the problem then becomes how to use it effectively.  What strategic advice would you give to best accomplish this?

I'm sure there were several tactical errors and oversights as well - any comments on these would be appreciated, too.]

C[>I had decided beforehand to play these four points no matter what the opponent chose.

Personally I think B's opening is too slow. You can compare to playing just one stone on tengen, and B's extra influence in the game does not seem to be worth three more moves. But as an experiment to use influence, it's a good idea.]
;W[pd]C[>How is white's decision to build influence to counteract the center in this situation?

Seems like a good idea.];B[co]C[>I decided that the best thing to do initially was start a fight., and try to split white up.  Would it be better to >play away from the lone white stone, such as in the empty corner?

I think it's consistent. You don't only have influence, you're very thick so it makes sense to seek out your opponent's thin spots and start fights everywhere.

>I felt that getting more influence by approaching the white framework from the outside would be redundant, >and an invasion seemed premature., so the lower side seemed best.

it's very hard to judge if this is better than playing in the empty corner...]

(;B[qf]C[>Continuing the attack on the lower left stones seems to be too focused,

not exactly bad, but my feeling is W left out a neccessary defensive move at the bottom, so I would have attacked it immediately.]

M16 is the only point -- exchanging P18 for Q18 does not gain you anything, and can be done at any time. It's important not to play moves just because they are sente, but because they are part of a bigger plan.
But more importantly, you left out a neccessary defensive move at L5 (which you got punished for later).]

Most of the mistakes in this game are of a tactical nature rather than strategic, and most of them are omitting neccessary defensive moves. You should consider this: if you have to take gote anyway, instead of first fighting and then when your 'attack' fizzles out you have to come back to cover your weak spot, how about just covering the weak spot directly and leaving the attacking possibilities for later. If your opponent has to take a move to defend, you gained tempo - and if he doesn't, you can attack with your back free later.]
