C[JoaoLuc:
This is a game from an online tournament organized among some Portuguese players.
It's a fast paced game: 15m+3x15s.

TM:
Hi, my name is Tomas and I will review your game. I will prefix my comments with "TM".]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[qe]C[TM: While this is possible, the usual continuation is to play in the top-left corner.]
;W[dp]C[TM: White should take the top-left corner here. If he lets black play there, the corner will work well with the influence on the top side given by the black enclosure in the other corner.]
;B[cd]
(;W[dc]C[TM: This is a bad move, your variantions are better.]

(;B[dd]C[TM: Do not let white into the corner.];W[ec]
(;B[cn]C[TM: You have unfinished business in the top-left corner, you should not run away from it.]
;W[co];B[dn]C[JoaoLuc: I think this is bad for white. But I do not really know how to profit.]
;W[fq]
(;B[kc];W[gd]
(;B[qn];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[qk]C[JoaoLuc: at this point, I thought game was black's.

TM: This is still playable for white. Black has a lot of influence, but not much actual territory. Black stones on the right side lack a base. The left side is low and can still be reduced.]

(;W[qh]

(;B[oq]C[JoaoLuc: I wanted to reduce the bottom.

TM: Playing this now only helps white to strenghten his corner.]
;W[nq]
(;B[op];W[oo];B[or]C[JoaoLuc: I think the sacrifice of these 3 stones was helpful in the endgame, but what about now? Was it ok?]
;W[nr]
(;B[no];W[po];B[rq];W[pr];B[mo]C[JoaoLuc: this was what I was aiming for. To reduce white.

TM: You could have played N5 without giving white the three stones first.]
;W[kq]
(;B[jo]C[TM: This stone is not really doing anything.];W[go]
C[TM: And neither is this stone. White should try to save his E14 group. Or reduce the top-right corner.]

TM: I think that both player should in their studies concentrate on direction of play.

Do not tenuki when your group does not have a base yet. Allways try to find the biggest move. Look for your own weak groups first. Fix them. Look for opponents weak groups. Attack them (to gain influence, not to kill). Only after that you should think about expanding your territory or reducing your opponent's one.

A lot of fights in this game were decided before they even begun, because the shape of a group was bad. That is another thing to concentrate on.

I hope you find this review useful.

Best wishes,
