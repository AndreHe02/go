AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi!

This was a game against a friend. I am white, larsbarfot. I would like to get a few comments on my play.

Hi back!

My name is Michael Reilly, I'll be reviewing this game.]
(;W[mq];B[or]TR[oq]C[Usual play is at the marked space.]
(;W[no]C[This move is questionable.  What is its aim?  It looks like you're trying to build influence by building a wall and sealing black into the corner.  But instead you're giving black a huge corner, and it's impossible to seal him in.]
;B[pm]
(;W[iq]C[This is too far of a jump.]
(;B[mr]C[Black helps you out with this move.];W[lr];B[nr];W[lp]
TR[no][iq][mq]C[Fixes your shape problems.];B[pj];W[fq];B[er]
;W[eq];B[dr]C[This move is a mistake.]
(;W[dq]C[I'm satisfied with this opening, but move d3 I'm unsure about. Should I have played for bigger territory?]
;B[cq]
(;W[cp]C[This cut produces a complicated battle and is a mistake.]
;B[co];W[bp];B[bq]
(;W[do]TR[jk][il][jl][hm][im][gn][hn][fo][go][ep][fp]C[Here's another mistake.  This ladder doesn't work.]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[fp];W[gp];B[bo]C[Black... gives the ladder up?]
;W[fo];B[ap];W[dp];B[aq]C[And gives you sente.  Ok!]
(;W[oo]LB[po:a]C[Very Small.  What are you gaining from this move?

Black will defend at A, and you haven't made any strength or territory.]
;B[po];W[oq];B[pq];W[nq];B[qr]C[Black defends another cut that didn't need to be defended.]
(;W[el]C[Good idea, using your strength to counter black's, wrong location.]

CR[nc][nl]TR[he][hg][hj][jl]C[At this point I planned to use this wall on the left side to take most of the middle of the board. But I was uncertain on how to proceed, and made a mistake as you can see in the following turns.

A good plan!  That's how you should use power.  I would suggest instead of the triangle points for play, the circle ones.  To make your plan happen.

Not immediately because you still need to push into the corner.]

(;W[jg]TR[fb][fc][fd][fe][ff][fg]C[Good, you're using your wall,  But I would actually suggest directly approaching the other corner because your wall is so powerful.]
;B[ne]C[This is a very unusual move.]
