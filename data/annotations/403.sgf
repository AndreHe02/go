I am 10k - that's ten stones short of expert.  So I will discuss principles, feelings and tactics - any of which can be wrong, and likely is :-)]

unusual approach.  the marks are more common.  

this approach doesn't seem to put much pressure on the corner.]

C[I do not know the proper response to black p16.  

I would have tried "a".  this might result in variation 2.

Regardless, white seems very flat.]
(;B[nd]BL[2613]LB[pc:A]
C["a" would have been good too.

black's moves here start to build a nice wall though]
;W[lc]WL[2587];B[pm]BL[2586]MA[qq][pq][op]
C[the marks are more common moves.

If white plays so far off the corner, he invites black to take it. 

black is trying to work in conjunction with his top wall, but he invites white to a big and safe corner.]
;W[pj]WL[2573]
C[instead of taking the corner, white invades and starts a fight];
B[ph]BL[2547];W[nj]WL[2544];B[nh]BL[2529];W[le]WL[2534]MA[pm]
LB[op:A][oo:B]
C["a" would have taken the corner and put pressure on the marked stone

"b" wouldn't secure corner, but puts alot of pressure on the marked stone.

white's actual move doesn't threaten the black stones.]
;B[po]BL[2514];W[qm]WL[2507]LB[pp:A]MA[nj][pj]
C[this invites black into the corner.  maybe "a" would have been better.

the marked stones aren't in real danger yet.

(rule of thumb: don't have more than one weak group at a time.  a good opponent will find a way to attack both at once.)]
;B[pp]BL[2483];W[pl]WL[2502];B[jp]BL[2478]MA[pm][po][pp]
C[big move.  works well with the marked stones];W[mp]WL[2496];B[mo]
BL[2455]LB[mn:A][oq:B][jn:C]
C[another rule of thumb:  contact moves are good for defense, not as good for attack.

attack from afar.

"a" would have been interesting.   

"b" threatens both a cap and r4.  

"c" threatens a cap and a moyo with e4.  (I like this best)

a dan level player would probably laugh at my suggetions :-)

;W[no]WL[2477];B[lo]BL[2432];W[lh]WL[2469]MA[dc][cn]LB[eq:A]
C[this closes blacks UR group in (sort of).  but attacking one of blacks marked stones would would also be interesting

whites c4 stone looks very lonely. perhaps "a" would work well also]
;B[nn]BL[2393];W[pn]WL[2454];B[om]BL[2373];W[on]WL[2443]
C[not good.  invites a double atari.];B[oo]BL[2336];W[qn]WL[2425];
B[mm]BL[2308]
C[this looks like good shape, but it invites the white peep which follows]
;W[nl]WL[2408];B[nm]BL[2212];W[fc]WL[2355]LB[de:A][ce:B]MA[lc][le][lh]
C[another unusual approach. 

"a" or "b" is more common.  white is working with his marked stones though.

I think the moyo he is building is too small to allow black such a big uncontested corner]
;B[de]BL[2193];W[dg]WL[2337]LB[cg:A][cj:B]
C["a" is better poised to invade the corner.  if black defends the corner an extesion to "b" is good.

still the lone white stone at the bottom is worrisome.

another rule of thumb:  the general order of play in the opening is:

1. corner
2. enclosure or approach move
3. side extension

the lone white stone at the bottom really wants an enclosure]
;B[ci]BL[2179];W[bg]WL[2329];B[be]BL[2168]LB[fe:A]
C[black at "a" would both attack white's moyo and weaken the two attacking white stones.  this move invites white to close black in the corner]
;W[ck]WL[2319]C[but white fights instead :-)];B[ep]BL[2159]
C[now black attacks the lone white stone.

even if it lives, black should get profit while attacking.]

;W[cl]WL[2135];B[bl]BL[1844]
C[the two marked stones are pretty much dead at this point. 

another rule of thumb:
if you can't read out how you are going to win a fight (in this case escape)  avoid the fight.

okay that said, I often ignore this rule :-)]

C[when I first looked at this move, I liked it.  but white kills it eventually, so perhaps "a" was better.

"a" prevents white from taking two marked stones, and from running into center.

C[white resigns

it is hard to comment on a fighting game like this one was, because I am not a strong fighter, myself.

white eschewed territorial moves throughout the game and chose to invade and fight. 

note that he invaded at the bottom.  even though he lived, he got only 5 points out of it.  (he did deny black 50 pts though)

he also invaded at g12 and lived.  but black took the corner and got way more territory.

So white made some excellent moves to live, when needed.  but black just made simple ordinary moves.  yet black won by more than 50.  Kageyama (author of Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go) would say that ordinary moves are all that are needed to win.  this game shows that.

the area I think both players need to work on is the opening.  the best moves serve two purposes, example taking territory while acting as a pincer.  both players chose to fight alot instead - but that's okay, too.  Fighting is fun.

fun game.  I enjoyed reviewing it.])
