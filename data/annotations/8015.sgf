C[Hi. I played this game against myself as a practice run. I don't know how strong I am, or what my rank is, but I hope that isn't a problem.

I'm aware that self-played games aren't ideal, but I will try to thoroughly analyze this one. So please, treat it like a real game between two opponents. Thank you.

Xinwen aka.Ignatius:::

Hello, I'm Xinwen your reviewer, you can look for me in KGS (National - Brunei Room). My blog is http://xinwengolife.wordpress.com

Yes, in fact playing with yourself is not ideal at all, I would prefer replaying professional kifu.]

(;B[ce]LB[cn:b][op:1][fq:a][kq:c][oq:d]C[I played Here to basically stop white's chinese opening before white could play C11. If she does, I'll have sente.

Xinwen:::
It is possible.

However I have another thought that why don't you set up your own fuseki first? Black is faster in a way though.

Black a, White b then Black c will produce Mini Chinese Fuseki.

Black d, will create a nother Fuseki called "orthodox fuseki" i believe, in chinese it is 平行布局.

If I'm White, My aim is to play "1" later.];W[cg]LB[hc:a][de:b]
[ee:d][nq:c]C[White makes an attack approach. I did this because the chinese opening is essentially a fighting opening. Would it have been better to have extended along the side? Or to tenuki?

Xinwen:::

I would play black a, White b then Black can c to what you wanted to.

Alternative, if you want to save the Black would be d jump. (click d to proceed to example game)]
(;B[oq]C[I've read that in some cases it is ok to tenuki on the next move. Is it appropriate here, though? Why or why not? Thank you.

Xinwen:::

explained on the previous move];W[eg];B[cc]LB[ee:a]C[Xinwen:::

most of the time is "a" jump for black?];W[cb]LB[dd:a]C[too aggressive?

Xinwen::: i would play White a to trap black's in.]
(;B[bc]LB[dd:a]C[Xinwen::::

I believe B17 is an amateurish mistake. Probably Black moves at a better. 

Otherwise white would just "a" now, then Black facing life and death.]
;W[fc]LB[dd:a]C[Xinwen:::

I believe F17 would better to play at a];B[bg];W[bf]LB[bh:a]
C[Too aggressive? Should I have perhaps played at B12 instead?

Xinwen:::

b14, not necessary, just a.

a brings black's life and death situation.];B[cf];W[ch];B[bh]
;W[bi];B[be];W[ci];B[ee]LB[fe:A]C[As you can see, B14 ends with a good result for both sides. But I think white gets the worst of it. She has to secure her top and bottom group. Black gets sente. E15 seems a little slow though... It does help split the two groups though. Perhaps E16?

Xinwen:::

click A to check my expectation]
(;W[eb]LB[ic:b][fe:a]C[Maybe too slow. Maybe reverse sente. Maybe white is seeing ghosts.

Xinwen:::

I believe White a gives good result.

In your game, White lives small, which is not so ideal to do so. Other expecation could be white playing b.]
;B[gp]LB[dn:1][gn:2]C[too high?

Xinwen:::

g4 is allright, giving the intention that you want a Moyo. You will want to expect White playing 1 then Black 1 to give nice influence to the right.]
;W[fq]LB[dn:a][gq:b]C[Xinwen:::

I don't really like F3 move, benefi both player though in this situation. Probably just a is enough for White.

Because if Black b now, you can see how thick the Black is to the right.]
;B[dq]LB[gq:a]C[This is probably an overplay on blacks part. either that, or a fighting move. It certainly speaks to not allowing a moyo. I'm not sure what the proper follow up is, so I wing it.

Xinwen:::

D3 i think it is a overplay. 

Because if Black would just a instead, could provide fearsome result.]
;W[eq];B[cq];W[cp];B[bq];W[bp];B[ds];W[eo]LB[er:a]TR[gp]C[Xinwen:::

White just  a to kill Black?

At the same time, notice that G4 has achieved nothing. You had hired the wrong guy (G4) in this warfield.]
;B[er];W[aq];B[ar];W[ap];B[bs];W[fr];B[jr]LB[pi:a]C[I don't think the result was good for black. Certainly, I get a small corner, but I made white strong towards her group. Not good.

Xinwen:::

Black k2, 2nd line move is not good, Probably just go to "a" area bigger.

K2, cannot protect the land 100%
K2, does not pose any threat to White
K2, too low for profit];W[iq]LB[qj:a]C[Again a fighting move, where the follow up is winged.

Xinwen:::

White probably just "a" as explained earlier. K2 is not a sente.

white does not have any reason to reply.];B[kp]LB[qj:a][oo:b]
C[Xinwen:::

Black L4 has made K2 a good move already.

Moreover, If White would hav just "a" aread just now, White still has "b" move as reduction.]
;W[jq];B[kq];W[io]C[Xinwen:::

White didn't get much from this result, extra stones surrounding a stone and few lands

In compairson to black, K2 has helped to strengthen the right side.]
;B[gn];W[go]LB[ho:a]C[Xinwen:::

g5 is not recommended.

If Black was to a atari you, then its over.];B[fn];W[fo];B[fk]
C[White has built up influence. So F9 seeks to erase. However, it's not looking good. alternative?

Xinwen:::

You got the idea correct. F9 is all right.];W[im]C[White gets to keep black separated. I like this move. How will black react?

Xinwen:::

due to the fact that Black made a mistake, yes J7 is a good move to reduce black's influence as well on the right.]
;B[km]C[Pushing white towards F6... doh! (what was I thinking? probably had my eyes on the juicy moyo around P6 area. But should have been paying attention to security first, perhaps? Not sure? Which is best, save F6 group, or build moyo?

Xinwen:::

This is rather tough, but i believe L7 is all right. Black F9 group wouldn't die easily i suppose.]
;W[qm]LB[qi:b][hk:a]C[White did not take advantage, probably because I was playing myself. Doh! then again, if R7 hadn't been played, juicy moyo, mmm... tasty. So It's difficult to say if L7 is sente or not. Maybe it just complicates things.

Xinwen:::

I believe White "a" is a sente to  Black to get profit before you invade R7 like that. I believe...R7 is played at b better?, not really sure.

There is this theory, Build-up strength before attack!

L7 is not a sente, it is just defending its influence.];B[qk]
C[Xinwen:::

R9 strong move.];W[ro];B[rl];W[rp];B[rq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qo];B[pp]

C[white makes decent life, to be expected, but black get's good prospects for profit in the upper right later. And G6 might still be saved. Also, pressure on F17 group? perhaps? Or is F17 group alive and well?

Xinwen:::

The invasion and living were not 100% correct, but it is be treated as invasion and to live = well done in the operation!]
;W[ic]LB[fe:a]C[I figured F17 could use some extra defense.

Xinwen:::

er....White F17 also helps Black?

White a is sufficient? But i'm just afraid White is a bit behind if doing "a" connect.

Another was that J17 should've been played earlier instead of E18 live.]
;B[jb]C[Xinwen:::

You can see Black is building up, I am going to my bet on black now.]
;W[ib];B[mc]C[Unfortunately, that makes black stronger. Is there a beter way to secure life for F17 group? Perhaps H18?]
;W[qd]C[Invasion.];B[qc];W[pc]C[too complicated?

It is all right to perplex the situation when White is losing.]

Yes, already pointed out earlier.];B[en]LB[gl:a]C[Xinwen:::

Black E6 is not necessary. Probably just a is enough.];W[dn]

Black should've gone "a".];W[ik]C[Xinwen:::

White has became better after some unecessary Black's moves.]

Could've tried "a" jump attack for Black.];W[dk];B[dl];W[dm]

;B[fj]C[Black has life fairly easily. So maybe I didn't need to worry too much? Or did white just hand it over?

C[Xinwen:::

black capturing the stone wasn't necessary at all.];W[cj];B[ef]
;W[on]LB[gd:B][sh:C][jl:A][ho:D]C[Reducing. How close is the game at this point? My estimate is that white has more territory, so black is slightly behind. If black wants to win, it all depends on what he does in the center right. Is this a correct analysis?

Xinwen:::

Ya pretty much like that. though i think Black has advantage in yose. A to D are kinda big.]
;B[ho];W[hp];B[hq];W[ip];B[ir];W[hr]C[Xinwen:::

White H2 probably not necessary, could've used it to attack.]
;B[hs];W[gr];B[id];W[hd];B[ie];W[he];B[jl];W[il];B[jh]C[White seems to be playing very passively all of a sudden. Could a ticket to a big victory lie in exploiting P6's natural entrance into Black's moyo? Perhaps a move around O9? Or better yet, N10? See variation:

Xinwen:::

Correct Variation. I think White leads this game already]

;W[nj]LB[lo:A][np:B]C[White nevertheless makes a great reduction. But black gets good solid territory. And white gets nothing but neutral space. Better way?

It was a good try, though the last move may not be necessary. Could've tried A or B reduction to the bottom.]

C[B+5.5

Overall, I'd like most of the feedback centered in equal proportions of what I did correct, as opposed to what I did wrong. I find that I improve so much more when I focus on my strengths in this way. If, however, I do make a blatantly incorrect move, please do not hesitate to point it out and correct me.

If you can, perhaps you can give a general breakdown of what my playing strengths and weaknesses are, and what my tendencies make me apt to do in certain situations. Thank you very much, I apreciate this review.

Xinwen:::

Thank you for showing me such an interesting game. I can see many rooms for improvement which you do not need to worry about hitting a HIGH barrier wall to climb or so.

Basically, to judge your performance::::

Fuseki knowledge, quite good, you got the idea, know the motive. Probably your strongest.

Joseki knowledge, well still all right. could've faced certain life and death if you meet a stronger player. Need to build up some foundation here.

Middle Game Judgment, Need to be improved. many unecessary moves.

Fighting, there is not much close combat in this game, though bombarding from far there is but not strong. Either side (black/white) got away too easily. 
- Learn to put pressure on opponent,
- Each attacking move possess of two tactics behind
- Push opponent towards Thickness

Invasion techniques, not strong
- Invasion techniques required tesuji and some Joseki knowledge as well.
- Imvasion does not need to live nicely, Invade - Dig- Planted bomb - Run. Success!

Escaping, not really an escape artist yet.
- Escape need to play it lightly
- Attack strongly to the weakness

Life and Death, Probably the weakest here.
- Check some Elementary Life and Death by Cho Chikun
- and some basic shape of corner Life and Death.

Yose, Still so so
- Always be sharp to spot atari, cut and weaknesses
- Yose in theory can bring back 20 points if played correctly.

Thank you very much!])
