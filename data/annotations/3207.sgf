;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]SQ[cc][cd][dd]C[senbu [?\]: why that move?

PNH: Nothing wrong with that move. Any one of the marked spots are quite playable.]
;B[pj]C[wetnose [29k?\]: i feel like getting more corner

ok cool sanrensei.];W[nq]C[senbu [?\]: ok

is this too far?

black: what is the best way to repond to this?

PNH: It's a fine answer.];B[oq];W[np]C[white: should i have gone for double wing]
;B[op]LB[pm:A][fq:B]SQ[pp][oq]C[PNH: This is crampy. A or B would be better.

The marked stones form an empty triangle (with the empty spot at Q3) and this is a very bad shape in Go. Since P3 and Q4 cannot be cut, it is inefficient to play P4 right away.]
;W[or];B[pr];W[nr]C[PNH: This is an endgame sequence and it is bad for white since it is "gote". It hands black the initiative for making a big opening move elsewhere.]

(;B[ps]LB[ce:C][no:B][fq:A]C[senbu [?\]: nm
wetnose [29k?\]: ?
senbu [?\]: sorry

PNH: I prefer A, B or C (in that order). Playing on the first line is suicidal in the opening. You must claim unclaimed territory of which there is plenty.]
;W[od]C[again too aggressive?

PNH: Contact play should be avoided in the opening except for defending an attacked weak group. Contact play is not agressive at all : it is actually defensive! It can be used to make eyes in cramped space since the goal then is not to be ahead but rather to live. For attack it is worthless since when you drop a stone next to your opponent's stone, he is always one stone ahead!]
;B[oc];W[oe]
(;B[pc]SQ[pe]C[PNH: This is not an empty triangle because of the white stone at P16 but it is still bad. It's too slow and overly secure. White Q17 shouldn't be feared (see variation). Q15 is better.]
;W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[ob]LB[fc:B][pf:A][fq:C]C[PNH: Too small. Consider A, B or C]
;W[dj]C[PNH: Good.];B[no];W[mo];B[nn];W[ph];B[qg];W[qh];B[qf]
C[black: should i have gone q13

PNH: This would have been good as well, with the aim of attacking the two white stones and connecting to the top only later on only if threatened.

white: same question instead of extending down];W[og];B[pi]
LB[fc:C][ce:B][mi:D][fq:A]C[PNH: This is too tight. Consider A, B, C or D]
;W[rg]LB[ni:C][pl:A][gp:B]C[PNH: Save this for later on.];B[oh]
;W[nh];B[oi];W[rh]SQ[pg]C[PNH: Watch for the cut at Q13. The white stones on the right could be in trouble.]
;B[rf];W[sf];B[se];W[sg];B[re];W[pg];B[of]LB[ce:C][me:B][fq:A]
C[PNH: Bad...];W[nf];B[pf]C[PNH: So, this was bad for black (P14) since it now lets white making a big move elsewhere.]
;W[ng]C[PNH: This is unneded. Black obviously cannot play there.]
;B[fb]C[white says: looks hard

PNH: That's too close from the border. It lets white play F16...]

(;W[fc]C[wetnose [29k?\]: whoa this game is different from our others
wetnose [29k?\]: kinda];B[gb]C[PNH: Never crawl on the second line. The third line is the territory line. The fourth line is the victory line. And the second line is the line of defeat. The influence that white gains towards the center (while running on the third line) is worth way more than the few territory points you make on the sole first line.]
;W[pe]LB[gc:A]C[PNH: This is an endgame move.];B[qd];W[hc]LB[gc:A]
C[senbu [?\]: did your rank go down lol?
wetnose [29k?\]: yes
wetnose [29k?\]: b/c i played that guy

is this good to do? looks like a lot of holes to me

PNH: Yes. H17 might be better.];B[gc]C[senbu [?\]: ah];W[gd]
;B[hd];W[id];B[he];W[ic];B[fd];W[ec];B[ge]C[PNH: Nice influent ponuki.]
;W[ih];B[lk]LB[ce:B][fq:A]C[PNH: Do not aim for the center (except when running out from an attack on a weak group) when there are still unclaimed borders.]
;W[mk]C[PNH: Remember my earier comment about contact play.]
;B[nk];W[ml];B[mj];W[ni];B[nj];W[lj];B[kk];W[li];B[mm];W[nm]
;B[mn];W[nl]SQ[oh][oi][pi][mj][nj][pj][nk]C[white: i am dead aren't i

PNH: I am unsure. Black's marked group is also vulnerable.]
;B[ol];W[om];B[pm];W[ll];B[km]C[PNH: Good play from black.]
;W[lm];B[ln];W[mi];B[on];W[ie];B[fh]LB[ce:A]C[PNH: This lets white play D12 (On the line of victory!)]
;W[ij]LB[dh:A][fq:B]C[PNH: Forget about the center at this stage in the game. Territory in the center is always overestimated.]
;B[if];W[jf];B[hg]
(;W[ig]C[PNH: Unnecessary. See variation...];B[hf];W[jh]LB[dh:A]
SQ[ig][ih]C[white: made a nice little thing in the top center side

PNH: Empty triangle are *ugly* ;-) Although K14 gives some use to the shape: K13 is protected. This move is still unnecessary when there is "A" (D12) waiting to be played.]

(;B[gh]SQ[fh]C[PNH: The marked black stone can not be cut so D12 is better. See variation...]
;W[qe]C[PNH: This is an endgame move.

You might think that is costs nothing to play it now since black is forced to reply. But it is bad to play it now because it removes "aji" (potential). This could server later on as a valuable ko threat for instance.]
;B[rd];W[dh]C[PNH: Excellent move.];B[ei]C[PNH: This also removes aji. In addition, it "forces" white to play a good territory move (on the line of victory!).]
;W[di];B[dg];W[fj]LB[cg:A]C[PNH: Do not let black bleed into your position.]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[gj]LB[cd:B][rj:C][fp:A]C[PNH: Go for the big points... ("C" later)]
;W[gk]C[PNH: Same advice for white.]
