C[Kuri [25k\]: good luck


A: This is your reviewer.  I am a 12-15 kyu player at the moment. I will begin my comments with A: since I am Andy.

A: I have just finished putting my notes in, and I think I found some spots where you could have done better, but I would recommend two things.  One is to get your rating up soon.  You're pretty good already and need a better reviewer than me.  The other is to submit games where you did badly and don't know why.  You pounded white here and it was hard work figuring out where you might have done better.

All the best, Andy];B[pp]C[SiTjrock [28k\]: thanks :-)];W[cd]

A: I must agree with your opponent.  You were playing opening moves better than mine would have been so not a lot that I can review.  One note at this stage.  The 4-4, 6-4 partial shimair you have in the lower left has some weaknesses.  You need, so the books say, either to guard the h3 point or to get the corner locked up or you might have a fight on your hands.]
;B[el];W[cl];B[bo];W[ql];B[qn];W[ol];B[nn];W[oq];B[qq];W[bj]
C[A: Your attack on his left group was a good idea, but it didn't come off well.  I would question E8 as the opening stroke of the attack.  It doesn't cut off his escape, it doesn't threaten to cut him up much (other than maybe a move to D7?) and it doesn't rob him of a base.   
The point of attacking a weak group is not just to kill it, but to benefit from the trade-off between your attacking moves and his defending moves.  G6, for example, gets you out from the corner, and B5 helps lock up the corner for you.  I don't see what E8 got you given what follows.  I would have preferred C8, which strengthens your left side group more.]
;B[jd];W[jc];B[ie];W[he];B[ig];W[ke];B[kd];W[kc];B[id];W[ic]
;B[hf];W[gf];B[gg];W[ff];B[fg];W[ch]C[A: Your reducing moves on top were good, but the failed attack on the left let white make some ground into what should have been your area.]
;B[dh];W[fl];B[gl]C[A: G8 may be a really good move, but I don't see the point of it myself.  I am not being sarcastic, because there may be lots of good to come from it, but if it was intended, then you ain't 28 kyu and I ain't ought to be your reviewer.]
;W[fj];B[fk]C[A: See this variation for a better white responsethat might have made better use of your positions weaknesses, namely the various holes and cutting points about G8 and the unnecessary white base on the left.]

(;W[gk]C[A: This is a lousy move on White's part.  F9 is connected out and his G9 isn't]
;B[ek];W[gi]C[A: Another horrible White move.  With G8 alive, his three stones have to run for cover or make life in the immediate vicinity of your thick line above.

This weak play from white gave you quite an advantage.];B[hk]
;W[gj];B[fn];W[em];B[gm]C[A: This last sequence was ghastly for white.  Many Faces of Go indicates a black lead of just over 20 points here, where the variation has white 30 points ahead.  White made small lumpy weak groups and let you repair your weaknesses.]
;W[dl]
(;B[dk];W[cj];B[ci];W[bi];B[di];W[bh]C[A: At this stage, black is still ahead by 20, but much of the board is still unoccupied.  White's stones on the right  are far from dead and the lump in the center left, while fairly dead, has abundant bad aji left.  There are many big points and attacks around.

If the idea of B14 is to kill all of white's stones on the left, then it is strategically an excellent move, but tactically a lousy one.  To my inexperienced eye, those stones will be very hard to kill.  There seems to be an eye around D7 and an eye around A10.  White has to defend it, but it can live.  You attack groups that must respond but can live in an effort to gain points around the edge of the group or to make ko threats, but the points are probably small.  If you can kill the group here, do it.  If not, B14 is a tiny point not worth playing now.

See the variations for a possible alternative or two.]
(;B[bf]C[A: It gains you five or six points]
(;W[gq]C[A: ... while White's much more ambitious move nets 15 at least.]
;B[hp]C[A: Lousy move.  You press him down a little, but then he takes the corner for a cool 20-point swing, and your stones at G6 press him a little anyway.  Better F3 or L5 I think.]
;W[cq]C[A: I tried a bunch to figure out how to kill this invasion.  See the variations.  I think there is one way, but way better to prevent the invasion with F3, which I think would be the "honte" move here.  Don't forget the "Go Lesson 1" idea that stones defending a corner have the biggest territorial return on investment.]

;B[in];W[oj];B[oh];W[of]
(;B[pg]C[A: We all fear getting cut apart on the empty diagonal spot, and I certainly could have made this move, but given what follows, consider that you could have moved elsewhere.]
;W[nh];B[oi];W[nj];B[og];W[ng]C[A: You have to go into O11 here.]

(;B[pj];W[pk];B[qk];W[rk];B[qj];W[kg];B[ji];W[kj];B[jk];W[jn]
;B[jm]C[A: You defended the small cut and now White's dead stones are alive, your position on the right is small, under pressure and without influence, and white has a numerical lead.

Go back and look at a variation.];W[kn];B[io];W[jo]C[A: Note the variation here.  You have been defending a lot and letting White push you around.  Look for chances to turn the tables.]

(;B[gp];W[hq];B[km];W[kl];B[jl];W[jj];B[kk];W[ll]C[A: Having just told you to look for ways of turning the tables, now I point out where a defensive move is necessary.  M6 has its benefits, but in retrospect, J10 looks better.  It would have enabled you to avoid the coming sequence in which White, had he paid attention, could easily have won the game.]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[mm];W[ij];B[hj];W[ii];B[hi];W[ih]
(;B[jh]C[A: This move is no good, because it invites a white response that luckily White did not adopt.  The trouble is I can't think of a better move.  It may be too late for o11 to do any good.]
;W[hh];B[gh]C[A: Here the concept of "aji" is illustrated.  Those five stones are still dead, but to make sure they stay that way, you have to make a move on G12, by rights deep in your own territory. Had White been on his game, he would now have moved at K13 and not only lived, but dominated the center of the board.  See variation.]

(;W[kh];B[jg];W[hg];B[if]
(;W[ld]C[A: White would have been better off at L11, I think.

It was a remarkable stroke that you got out of this.];B[ki]
