C[hello,
i was playing white in this game at a german tournament as a 1k.]

(;W[kd]TR[ne][qc][pf]C[is this pincer ok with the white stones on the right?
I wouldnt play the pincer myself if i have a simple alternative since the opponent has many choices (marked intersections), but it is pobably no a bad move.   However, after a pincer you often end in gote.  Hence, if you intended to play the pincer, i would recommend to play Q10 instead of R10, since this makes the resulting moyo more difficult to reduce.  (see variation)]

C[This joseki is a bit complicated.];B[lc]LB[nd:A][rd:B]C[kogo's joseki dictionary only has A an,d B.  The idea is to create defects in whites wall.
Hiwever, this black move certainly goves sente to black.]
(;W[ld]
(;B[oj]C[should black push through at O16?
After O16, White L17 is sente, so perhaps black can keep pushing through in reserve.
It is sente anyway since black O15 would be terrible.];W[kc]
TR[pl]C[I prefer a move at the marked place.  the move in the game has no big followup and its important to keep the reducing stone under pressure.]
;B[ol]C[now the block is not sentte, so black can play one more reducing move.  And if white now plays o16 i think black can discard his three stones to take sente once more since white has put so much effort in it that it's probably not efficient any more.]
;W[ql];B[oh]
(;W[fq]C[It seems this move creates a new weak group. Your variation creates a strong group on the left, which is good.  Blacks stones seem to work together, but perhaps one can improve on that?]
;B[hq];W[hp];B[iq];W[fo];B[cn];W[cg];B[dq]
(;W[gc];B[qi];W[dc]C[perhaps this invasion is too early or even impossible. Do you see other big moves or strategys for white?
white is getting quite weak on the right now. When black fences in white correctly, white will have a weak group on the left, a few weak ones at the bottom and a deffective position at the right.]
;B[dd];W[cc]
(;B[eb]C[i think black can kill white with this move. Is that correct, or does white have a way to rescue his stones in the corner?

janr: black seems a bit overagressive]

(;W[bo]C[i thought i had to to something like this because black has more territory and i have more influence, but black can kill whte.

I like more the variation since they reduce black while trying to enforce the white weak groups.]

splitting white is more important.
only play b8 when necessary for living.];W[bq];B[cp];W[dl];B[fr]

Thank you.])

(;W[pi];B[oi];W[pg]C[One could consider to defende the right side, or first exchange M4/M3 and/or O4/N3.
It looks bigger than G17 since it has big folow-up moves (trying to attack black center stones or run out with white bottom stones ???)]

I agree it is probably a bit too straightforward since black gets good profit.
On the other hand, white can look forward to an attack on the black stones in the cetner?]
