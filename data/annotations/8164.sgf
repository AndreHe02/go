C[I'm playing white in this game, and I am not supposed to be 1k, but I was expecting this game to be interesting anyway :-)

I'm french by the way.

MR: I'm German, so unfortunately you have to live with comments in English ;-)

MR: There are some key points in the game. In some situations, "direction of play" is a matter, and the strategic question of whether to save every single stone (or better not to do so ;-) ). In some other situations, the question is more a tactical one, like the life and death problem in the upper right corner or some other middle game situations with "bad shape". 
I inserted comments where I felt appropriate, always starting with "MR", and tried to answer most of your questions on the way.]
;B[pd];W[cc];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk];W[jp];B[jd];W[qf]C[This is a classical approach to the chinese fuseki, isn't it ?

MR: Yes, this is one possibility.];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qi];B[qo]
C[I was asking for the R7 invasion, maybe I had to protect around O11 before anything else ? I didn't like white P11, Black O9 for instance.

MR: I don't think that you have to play with the group on the right side. My first impulse would be H17, as K16 is open to the side and black can play an extension here in sente if he likes to. In case that black does not answer to H17, the black top becomes not too strong which in a way protects the white right side group.]
(;W[ci];B[cn]
(;W[cl]C[Maybe C5 would have been good ?

MR: To me it feels that C8 is "wrong direction", as all the white stones on the left side are low (C17, C11, C8).]
;B[cq]
(;W[dq]C[MR: This feels strange as well. 

Blocking at D3 ends in gote, and white K17 is open at the edge, inviting the black extension M3.

In this situation, both blocking moves do not lead to a very favorable result, so C8 was a mistake to begin with. Also see the variation with the other blocking move C4.]
;B[cp];W[do];B[bn];W[em];B[lq]C[MR: Good for black.];W[jq]C[Very passive, now I think somethiong like M5 can be better, and it aims maybe to the lonely "R11 and so" group]
(;B[oi]C[Elephant eye ?

MR: ???

I do not think that this is a real threat for white.]
(;W[pj]C[Play inside :) But I was going nowhere ... What would have been better here ?

MR: See variation for one option.];B[nk];W[pk];B[ql]
(;W[nl]C[MR: ?];B[ml];W[mk];B[nj];W[lk];B[mm];W[ol]C[Funny sequence ^^

MR: No, simply bad shape for white.];B[nn]C[MR: Black is asking for trouble for his center group.]
;W[mf]C[And now black's group is a bit in trouble ...];B[og]
;W[of];B[ng];W[nf]C[Thanks black ?

MR: Yes, this is strange procedure by black.];B[li];W[jk];B[ld]
C[MR: This gives the initiative to white. It is not so trivial to decide on where to play. If you play around L14 or L13, you drive black into the white moyo. If you play around J11, there might develop a life and death battle between the white group on the side and the center black group.]
(;W[kg]C[Thanks again ?

MR: This way, white is hopping to the outside while black is hopping into white's potential moyo.]
;B[ji];W[ig];B[hi];W[hk];B[fi];W[mh]C[MR: What exactly is the goal of this move?]
;B[mi];W[nh];B[lh];W[lg];B[oh];W[mg];B[mj]C[MR: N12 and the following sequence becomes a minus for white as black takes a liberty of the M9/N9 stones.]
;W[kj]C[MR: This saves M9, but it gives the initiative to black (see G13).]
;B[jh];W[jg];B[gg]C[My group can live I am convinced in that, but i guess my way of playing wasn't that good ...

MR: Yes.]
(;W[he]C[MR: This move is strange shape.

Locally, there is also still the aji R12 etc.]
(;B[fe];W[df];B[eg]C[Black's too ...];W[hc];B[fc];W[kc]C[This is interesting, could black do better than that ?]
(;B[jc]C[MR: L16 is an alternative to keep things simple.];W[kd]
;B[ke];W[lc]
(;B[md]C[M15 instead of that probably

MR: Yes.];W[je];B[le];W[jb]C[And white's group is alive, black is not yet]
;B[re]C[I didn't see that this move aimed to cut, that is a big mistake i guess.

MR: I don't think that it is too much a problem for white when the stondes around Q10 are cut off. They are strange shape and a burden anyway ...]
;W[nb];B[qh];W[ph]C[I tried something

MR: This move looks strange ...];B[pg];W[qg];B[rh];W[rg];B[ri]
C[But now here I am sure white can kill the uper corner. How ?
Directly R17 ?

MR: R17 is the vital move. But it is too difficult for me to read all the variations ...]
;W[pb];B[mb];W[qc]C[MR: P17 would be an option that might initialize a trade.]
;B[mc];W[id];B[lb];W[ic];B[sb]C[This move is interesting, and I really didn't find out how to answer it]

(;W[gn]C[This move was probably stupid too.

MR: ... and now the M9 stones get caught after all :-( - compare this to having played J7 instead of L9!]
