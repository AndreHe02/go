TM[1200]KM[0.5];B[qd];W[dd];B[fc]C[b3 [f17\] is probably better off taking another corner  unless black has a specific plan (which doesn't seem to be the case, b3  [f17\] is not used stregically in later fuseki moves).

sometimes b3 is used as an approach move to  w1 which is at a 3-4 point.   this is known as the `Shusaku' fuseki.]
;W[hc];B[pq];W[dp];B[dj]C[b7 [d10\] doesn't make effective use of the f17  stone.  b7 would be better at f15 or c14.]
;W[dm]C[Since b is giving white a chance to swallow the f17 stone, do so!  i  would play w8 to be f16.  w8 [d7\] is not a bad point, not certainly not  pressing.  if w is not going to play in the upper left, I would suggest an  approach move against q3 or r16 instead of d7.]
;B[cg];W[ce];B[jc];W[ge]C[i think g16 or f16 put more pressure on the black  stone at f17.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[ec];W[db];B[fe]C[now the weakness of w g15 is  clear.  i would suggest a move to strengthen g14, instead of d14.

this is good because w's corner is already safe, and it builds up thickness  that could be used to put pressure against b k17.  if w plays on the left, b  will be able to break out with g16.]
;W[df];B[gd];W[ie];B[he];W[hd];B[gf];W[hf];B[dg];W[be]C[i don't think b15 is necessary.]
;B[ef];W[bl]C[once again,  an approach towards one of b's 3-4 stones is  probably bigger.]
;B[id];W[ge];B[ld];W[he];B[oc]C[q17 is probably better  off around q14 (always think big!), since it would be unreasonable for w to  invade around p17.]
;W[hb]C[h18 is slow, i'm not sure what it is doing.

it is almost always wrong to play slow low (on the 2nd line) so early in the  game, if you find yourself conidering 2nd line moves, try to see what it  does, and compare to the other huge fuseki moves still available like r5,  which black takes next.]
;B[qo];W[mq];B[qj]C[r10 is probably better at q10.  in general when you play  a move with low positions on either side, play the move high, and vice versa.]
;W[qg];B[qf]C[here w jumps deep into the black moyo.  black should try to  attack the w stone, and try to form territory and thickness by attacking the  white group.

in general, it is a bad idea to play a contact move against an invading stone  (proberb: never touch what you are attack, since contact moves make both  groups strong, and tend to settle shape quickly).

a move around p13 or p10 would have been a good start.];W[pg];B[pf];W[ng]
;B[nf];W[oj];B[kq];W[hq];B[pk]C[q9 better at q8, i think.   (proverb: always play kiema [knight's move\] against boshi [one space cap\]).]
;W[pj];B[qk];W[pm];B[qm];W[po];B[pp];W[pn];B[qn];W[no];B[ko];W[jr];B[jq]
C[k2  is probably better at l2, since in general it is better to keep your opponent  from connecting when possible.]

;W[bm];B[dr];W[cr]C[c2 is aji keshi.  no need to be played, just play e2, and b  will have to respond at c2.]
;B[br];W[er];B[cs];W[bh];B[dh]C[try to avoid the  empty traingle shape, it is inefficient, and has a bad stone to liberty  ratio.   if b is trying to maintain connect to the d10 stone, a play around c11 would  be better, since it also works to disconnect the w b12 stone from the w b8  group.

if b is trying to protect the cut around e13, a move around e13 or f13 would  be better.]

;W[ok];B[hi];W[il]C[j8 is probably too deep into b's moyo, and too  close to b's thickness.  probably better at h7.]
;B[ho];W[go];B[hp];W[gp];B[iq];W[hr];B[hn];W[ek]C[e9 is not sente to the b d10 group.  w e9 would be better  played at g8, to save the j8 stone.]
;B[gl]C[otherwise, b gets the key point.];W[ej];B[hl];W[dk];B[kj]C[b L10 is conservative, better around M11.]
