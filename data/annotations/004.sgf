[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[dl];W[pj];B[pk];W[oj];B[ok];W[qj]C[reid:  I think w would be better of continueing out into the center with o10 or n10.  In this game, center power will be very significant since it will affect all four of the side moyos.  r10 looks big, and it looks like w can continue by attacking the corner, but b has sente to take r12, and w has no base.]
;B[qh];W[oh]C[reid: i think n10 would be a more usual continuation.];B[me]
;W[ld]
(;B[mg]C[reid:  b n13 looks a little too slow to me.  When white answers with n11 or n10 or even perhaps o9, the exchange seems to be in white's favor.  The four white w stones look difficult to attack effectively, so perhaps black should try something else.  see vars.]
;W[mj];B[nk]
(;W[li]C[reid: m11 leaves b the peep at n12, so white will have a hard time sealing black into the corner.  perhaps the variation would work better.]
;B[kq]C[reid: does b need to be this aggressive?  I think n2 would be sufficient.]
;W[jq];B[mq];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp]C[reid: this thickness really helps the white n10 stones.]
;B[pb]C[reid: risky for b to take sente here.  there ought to be some aji in the lower right that w can exploit later.]
;W[pr]
(;W[ef];B[cg];W[kg];B[eh]C[reid: e12 looks too small.  Looking at the black formation, e12 wants to be at least to f12.  But the real key for b here is that white has lots of weaknesses around l12, l14, and f15.  Because of these weaknesses, b can be a lot more daring than e12.]
;W[ll]C[reid: a nice move! helps fix up white's weaknesses while building the bottom moyo a little.  May even have some effect on the lower right corner aji.]
;B[fm]C[reid: black's shape with f17, d8, c11, and e12 looks very awkward.  b could be much more positive here, since his formations are already pretty thick.  perhaps b g5, l10, or something around  j14 would be better.  And fixing the corner aji with o4 is pretty huge, too.]
;W[pm]C[reid: i don't think this is a good way to make use of the corner aji.  it is too close to black's thickness at q9.]
;B[on]C[reid: p6 looks like a good answer.  it also helps patch up the corner aji.]
;W[ri]C[reid: s11 is a big move, but it's big even without the q7 - p6 exchange.]
;B[rk];W[sf];B[re];W[gh]C[reid: very big! but it looks like w is behind, and he needs to try a little harder.  this is probably w's last chance to try q2.]
;B[fg];W[gg];B[ff];W[he];B[go];W[gp];B[bq];W[cr]C[reid: i take it you don't like to hane in response to b3, dave? :-)]
;B[jr];W[ir];B[kr];W[hq];B[ob];W[nb];B[fj];W[hj];B[np]C[reid: white missed his chance to try something in the corner :-(  I think the key points for w in this game were r10, which started most of his problems, and then not taking advantage of the aji at q2.  Also, q7 is a pretty serious mistake - too close to thickness.]
