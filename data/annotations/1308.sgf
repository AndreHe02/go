(;W[dc]C[All whites stones are on the third line.  This doesn't feel right at all, if white isn't going to approach blacks stones then he should play C16 not D17]

(;B[jj]LB[do:a][pe:b][op:c][de:d]C[Corners first, Side Second, Middle Last.  We still have 4 corners open.  Any of "A-C" would be correct.  But this stone as played doesn't work with any of the stones on the board yet.]
;W[ci]LB[dj:a]C[Again corners are better.  Beside Black played in the center.  He must be interested in an influence game.  Thus playing low only helps black.  4th line would have been better to thwart Blacks plans.  If you are going to play on the side before the corners then "A" is better]
;B[df];W[cl]C[Good answer, none of Black stones are working together]

(;W[pe];B[pg]LB[op:a]C[Black continues to pursue an influence game.  The correct move would have been P4.  Getting two corner enclosures is just too good to pass up.]
;W[jc]C[K16 would have been better balance.  All Whites stone on the top were played on the third line.]
