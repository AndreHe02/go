AB[pd][dp]C[Otake:  Hello reviewer.  Middle game fighting is the weakest part of my game, so maybe comments there would be most helpful.  I lose a big group and resign.  Thanks, in advance, for your help.]

(;B[dd]C[Otake:  Would K10 be more consistent?  I sometimes play that after having read Go Seigen's Way of Play for the 21st Century.


Both would be consistant, but it's a matter of style, I actually play a 3-4 here, but that's just me, but this move is as consistant as possible.]

(;B[pf]C[Otake:  I thought about O16 but opted for this with the idea of making R14-R10 overconcentrated.


The only thing about making white overconcentrated is that it goes from a weak group to a strong group.

I would say this is the biggest mistake in the game];W[pe];B[qe]
C[Otake:  I knew the ladder was bad for Black but I thought my ladderbreaker would be better than it was.  Was P15 best?]
;W[oe];B[qd];W[pg]C[now that white's group is much stronger is becomes harder to use the Q5 wall]

that would be hard for me to say, I think black had missed several good oppurtunities in the game and besides white's big mistake in the beginning white has only been catching up.]

the reason the wall is bad is because it makes moves like this very easy for black, if you don't play these moves and use the wall, then the bottom becomes okay for white.]
