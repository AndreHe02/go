All of my comments will begin with a RR:.


Comments made after the review:
Black's game started off good, but then some bad attack points led to white's advantage.
Black needs to learn two things:
1)  When attacking with an advantage, don't attach to opponent stones.
2)  During the beginning, look for big points.  Remember the following three sayings:
    1.  Where am I weak?
    2.  Where is my opponent weak?
    3.  Where is the big point?
There were several times in the beginning where black made attacks at white, when making the black stones stronger was the better move.]
;B[pd]C[Chaghatai [13k\]: Hello
Hello reviewer this one just went downhill, I say numerous mistakes, but I'm hoping you'll see more

RR:  I'll do my best!];W[dp];B[pp]C[xinix [12k\]: have a good time]
;W[dd];B[pj]C[RR:  Black starts with a Chinese opening.  Inviting White to come in and attack the "big area" that black has just created.]
;W[qg]C[RR:  White jumps in.  Black should now use the strength in this area to expand along the topside, and make white struggle for a small life or an eyeless escape to the center.]
;B[nd];W[qm];B[np];W[rd]C[I figure I better split em somehowso I attacked the stronger half]
;B[qi]TR[qj][qc]C[RR:  I really can't decide if I like this move or not.  I don't like the idea of approaching the strong group.  Go theory says that if you attack the weaker stone in order to get your weak stones stronger, the attacked stones will get strong also.  However, in this case, even if black attacks the lower white stone, the upper white group looks pretty solid.
Usually if I can't decide if I like a move or not, I go off and play somewhere else, like the left side.

Tough choice here.

I've looked at this again and again...  I've seen the results, and I'm still not sure what the best move is...
Now I'm thinking about straight down.  It doesn't attack either side, but both sides are a little weaker.  Black can still jump out to the middle.

Maybe, before making this move, black needs to respond in the corner.]
;W[qc];B[re]TR[pc][cf][qo]C[RR:  Black can't cut off white here.  At this stage of the game, it is best to let the situation be, and make a bigger play elsewhere (see marked locations.)

After looking at the rest of the game, I think that this is a loosing move for black.  This attack is is in the wrong spot, and white comes out very nice.]
;W[rf]
(;B[qd];W[rc];B[qf];W[se]
(;B[rg]C[RR:  Best to connect here, let white make the connections, and then take sente elsewhere, where there are bigger points.]
;W[qe];B[rh];W[pf]C[RR:  This is a bad result for Black.  
Black started off with a strong opening, with 3 stones, one on each point.  Now white has one strong group, one weak group.  Black has 2 weak groups.]
;B[pc];W[om];B[fc];W[kc];B[ic]C[A two spaec extension and a pincer, can't be a bad move, right?

RR:  This looks like a good move, but be aware that the black group on the upper right is very weak.]
;W[nb]C[RR:  White exposes black's weakness by playing here.]
;B[mb];W[mc];B[lb];W[lc];B[nc];W[kb];B[ob]C[white has no base, I'm pleased

RR:  Yes, good sequence for black];W[ke]
(;B[cf]TR[ie]C[RR:  As black, it would be good to push once towards the center, and then make the current move.]
;W[dc];B[bd]C[sliding into the corner here

RR:  Which is good.  But the two stones on the top are now very weak.  They only have one way to run, the center.  Stones on the 3rd line have a hard time running into the center!]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[hc];B[hd];W[fb];B[fd];W[eb];B[cb]C[RR:  I don't know if black is trying to take away eyes, or take the corner.  Corners are usually very small, and there are bigger points to play now.
White can connect to the right very easily, so I'm guessing black is going for corner territory.]
;W[ib]TR[gg]C[I think I should have managed this attack better

RR:  Black was behind from the start.  By jumping out to the center now, you can connect up or make some eyes.]
;B[cn]TR[cf][np][fq]C[RR:  The top group is not done yet.  Black needs to play up there first.

Regarding the current play:
If you were to attack the lower left corner, do it from the other side.  Here is my reason why.
On the left there is a stone on the 3rd line.  The played stone is also on the 3rd line.  They don't work well together.
On the bottom, the marked stone is on the 4th line.  by playing the marked spot (F3), this is an extension from the O4 stone, and forces the white stone to extend up the left side, which black already has a stone on the 3rd line.]
;W[gq];B[cq]TR[kq]C[RR:  Jumping into the 3,3 point should be more of a last resort.  Black should extend on the bottom (see marked spot)]
;W[dq]C[RR:  I think that white plays the wrong direction here.]
;B[cp]C[RR:  This is a good exchange for black.];W[kq]
(;B[ko]C[I thought this was a good cap, but I  lost the corner next

RR:  A common mistake.  Black never "had the corner to loose."  The black stones are on the 4th line, which should be for center influence.  Stones on the 3rd line can control the corner.]
;W[nr]C[is trying to defend the corner a decent move? I failed here though

RR:  Can't defend the corner from the 4,4 point, but black doesn't have to let white have an easy time getting into the corner.

It is very important to keep the black stones connected, and into the center.  A side benefit will be that the 3 stones will get very strong, and might be able to attack the 2 white stones on the right side.]
;B[oq];W[qq];B[qp]C[RR:  Keeping white seperated is very important.  Good move by black.]
;W[or]
(;B[ql]TR[rl][ro][pl]C[trying to remove w's base

RR:  Black will make white's stones stronger by making "touching" moves.  Black should remove white's base from a distance.  See marked points.]
;W[rl];B[pl];W[pm];B[rk];W[rq];B[rp];W[pq];B[nk]C[RR:  This looks like a good exchange.  White gets the corner, but black gets to attack white's stones.]
;W[oo];B[op];W[mm];B[km];W[ol]TR[ok]C[RR:  In your variation, you were afraid of the cut at Q9.  In terms of making white eyes, black has nothing to be worried about.]

(;B[pk];W[ok];B[oj];W[mk];B[nl]C[RR:  This is a bad sequence for black.  White can connect her stones, and have several stones facing the center]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[nn];B[nj];W[ln];B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[kn];B[jo]
;W[ip];B[jn];W[bl]TR[ki]C[RR:  I can't belive that white didn't continue with the group on the lower right.  Black should ignore this move, and try to kill it.]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[dl];W[ci];B[bh];W[ch];B[bg]TR[cg]C[RR:  Can lay up one more line.  This puts a little more pressure on the 4 white stones.]
;W[bi];B[bm];W[dk];B[bk]TR[ek]C[RR:  While taking the eyes away, this is a small move.  Better to press at the head of the stones, and make white  play back here in gote.]
;W[bj];B[al];W[fk]C[RR:  After his exchange, white now has a jump to the center.]
;B[ef];W[de];B[df];W[ee];B[ff];W[fh];B[mj]TR[ki]C[RR:  to attack this group, black should not make touching moves.  Catch a bigger fish with a net.]
