C[Hi,

My name is Jernej and I've been playing for about a year. Haven't played much for the last few months, and the last time I was at 6k on KGS, so I hope my comments will be useful to you. Will try my best.

Cheers,
Jernej

Any general help would be nice, I am not sure what I need to change my way of thinking or what? lately I been losing alot of games and most have been b/c my opponents moyo is large or just miss plays. Please any advice will be appreciated.

In this game I believe I missed chances to reduce my opponents moyo but wasnt sure when I should have invaded or not]

(;B[cm]TR[de][cg]C[I think this was too far when I looked back on it? or is this ok b/c of the marked stones?

depends on what you want. If you want to attack the corner, than C6 is better]
;W[gq];B[qe];W[nq];B[pn]LB[kp:A][lp:C][kq:B][lq:D]C[would a high or low pinch been good here?  or bad idea in general? or made a two space jump instead of a one

I wanted to play it safe and a little differently then used to

You did correct choice. No need to play in the midst of white strength. But R6 might be better.]
;W[qj];B[ql]LB[qh:A]C[was this the wrong direction or would A been better?

Yes, I think so, but am not sure. Here white can make a nice extension to A13. R12 now would work great if you had played R6 before.]
;W[oj]C[bad white move. Now you could squeeze the group from both sides, and it would have no base]

(;B[ld];W[jd]C[both moves were too high, better on third line]

yes, too slow];W[nf];B[nd];W[kc]
(;B[lc];W[mk];B[ml]C[this move has no purpose. After N9, white is sage, and there is no area for black to get with N8]

not bad, but what followed was not good for black, but interesting]

was correct. Otherwise the white stones would be saved by white playing there]
