C[I'm surprised your rank is only 20k.  Your play seems very strong to me.  Most 20k players play many meaningless moves each game.

Even most of your bad moves had a good idea behind them.  And your play is very solid, leaving few if any weaknesses.

From this game, my biggest advice is to keep your eyes open for opportunities.  Are you familiar with the concept of attacking (as opposed to trying to kill)?  http://senseis.xmp.net/?AttackAndDefence  There were several times when the opponent had a weak group and you missed an opportunity to attack that weak group and profit by solidifying a group, extending a group's territory, or nullifying an opponent's wall.

Also, in the endgame (and especially the middle game), watch out for moves that are only worth one point.  One-point moves are very easy to identify, and are therefore very tempting to play.  However, there are often much bigger moves on the board.

I enjoyed reviewing your game.  I hope you find my review helpful.  If anything is unclear, or if you have any other questions, feel free to email me.]

MA[bl]CR[dm][dp]LB[bm:A][bp:B][cp:C]C[Up until now, Black's moves have all been very reasonable. Black's group is weak, and urgently needs to be strengthened.  While it's certainly possible to strengthen a group by creating eye shape like you did with A, it's better to secure more eye space by extending to D or E.  This has the added benefit of giving you more territory.  Compare the variation]

;W[pi];B[ni];W[og];B[ng];W[ne]CR[pi][pl]C[White's marked stones are on the fourth line, making it hard to create a base for his group.  He's just played two knight's moves in a row; it should be very easy to cut one.  At this point, I would look for a way to cut out his base, then cut one of the two knight connections.  See variation for one approach.]

;B[fp];W[gd]C[There is a lot of danger for white at the bottom.  This is a dangerous time for White to tenuki. Black should be salivating over the potential profit down there, looking for every possible opportunity to press the assault.]
;B[fc];W[gc]C[And here is the perfect opportunity.  White's play doesn't put black's stones in much danger.  See variation for what might happen if black returns to the bottom right now.]

;B[kg]CR[og][pi][pl]C[Yes, white is getting quite a wall on the left and bottom, but I still like harrassing the weak stones on the right while creating a base for Q16, or playing on the bottom to enlarge the envasion and threaten poking all kinds of holes in the white wall on the bottom.  (I showed both options in previous variations.)]
;W[gf]CR[nd][kg]LB[kd:B][jj:A]C[Instead of A, what about B?  This applies pressure on white's weaker stones on the right.  And it's not in danger, since it will be able to connect to one of the marked stones.

Usually, when attacking an opponent's weak stones, the attacker ends with sente, and so can probably play A later.]
;B[jj];W[il]CR[cl][en][do][bj][bk][bm][cm][cn][co]LB[al:A]C[The marked stones are now in huge danger.  They need to either form two eyes or escape to the center.  It looks hard for them to escape to the center now, so they must get two eyes.  If white plays at A, they cannot from two eyes.]
