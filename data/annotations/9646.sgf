C[Hello, dear reviewer!
This game what I... was kinda proud of.
And this is the reason why I send it to review.
Please, note some major moments.

Best regards,
Alexander Gilyazov (black)

Hello Alexander,

Thank you for this game and comments! I'll try to add something interesting.

LB[qg:2][qh:A][ql:B][bp:C][mq:1]C[I was choosing between this two.

This position is roughly symmetric, so you can delay this choice and play somewhere else to make it clear. I'd say that 1 is a good move here, because after it you can attack with A (if White doesn't answer on the right side) or develop your positions on the left, threatening White's corner  with C (otherwise).

The main idea is: A or B form a shape that can't defend the corner. None of your corner stones is effective for influence now, because White has solid positions everywhere. So, I'd like here to add a stone closer to the corner to protect it and catch up for territory (like 2) or just give up and develop leftside moyo directly.]
;B[qh];W[qn];B[ql];W[on];B[np]C[I'd say that O3 is better here, because it makes a more-or-less secured shape in 1 move. What if you won't have time later to add a stone (say, L3) here?]
;W[rp]LB[pk:A][qq:B]TR[np]C[Again maybe there is something better?

I'd like to start a fight with A here (because 4-4 stones are high and are created for fighting), but here your O4 becomes a problem. See the variation.]

(;B[qq];W[pk];B[hq];W[bp];B[kq];W[nc]TR[bp][hq]C[I like this exchange for black.

I'd say that it seems nice, but it isn't so, because overall your position on the bottom is developing too slow. The reason is: imagine that instead of this sequence Black plays L3 (it's completing the shape and is natural), White responds with B4 (which defends a big corner, threatens C8 and is natural) - now we can see that H3 (J3 for White, respectively) is only a big yose point, and the O17 area is much more promising.]
;B[pc]C[I can't say that I know a better move for now, but R12 becomes arguable. I think that if you had placed it earlier on R13, other moves would be the same, but your corner shape would be solid.]
;W[kd];B[bo];W[co];B[bn];W[dn];B[cq];W[cp];B[dm];W[em];B[en]
;W[eo]C[Is this OK for white?

I think it depends hardly on ko-threats and consequences. If White takes this ko (and you ignore it to realize the ko-threat), White threatens to destroy your right side. What do you have in reply if you take this ko?]
;B[do];W[qf]
(;B[pf];W[dn];B[ed];W[fn]LB[ec:A]TR[ol]C[Should I play A?

I think no. More to say, I don't know what A is aiming for, because the ladder comes to the marked place and hence doesn't work.]
;B[dl];W[ec]TR[nc][kd]C[Even with the ladder, I prefer G17 here to help the marked stones and take the whole side.]
;B[qg];W[gf];B[ie];W[bh]C[How to handle it?

I'd choose to give up some territory and take the initiative.]

I'm sure that A doesn't, but (keeping in mind, that saving marked stones gives you a clear lead) I suggest another variation.]

I think that connecting with A is nice - I don't know how to save more territory here (and A should be enough).]

C[A seems hard

As I mentioned earlier, this move is nice - I have nothing against it (keeeping in mind, that all you have to do is to keep the lead, and A isn't necessary).

Let me summarise what happened here. After the opening, White tried to get the whole top side with 1, and his attack on the 2 stone  was nice, but a bit later (after 3-4 exchange) he didn't take care about his top stones and therefore lost them all. Two stones he cut off (5 and 6) weren't enough as a compensation.

My conclusion:

1. In the opening, try to choose between the third and the fourth line (the same for 2- or 3-space jump) more carefully. Keep the balance.

2. In the middle game, when you have a weak group, try to defend directly before attacking and threatening. If your opponent wasn't so careless about the top group, it would be hard.
On the other hand, when all your stones are ok, try to gain the initiative and be the first who attacks.]
