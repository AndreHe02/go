C[RS:
Hello.

My name is Roland Schatz, and I'm about 4 kyu on KGS. I played white in this game (account flOvermind).

I chose this game for review because it's a typical example of my recent style. Recently my games can be divided in two categories: Either I try to play solid and get faced with a huge moyo, or I try to prevent the moyo and get myself into trouble with too many weak groups.

This game is an example of the first category. I don't really understand what happened in this game. After fuseki, I had solid territory and black had a huge moyo. To me it seemed that I was already behind a lot.

Then I managed to make a huge invasion and the game was close again, but I feel like this shouldn't have worked out so well if black hadn't made some mistakes when attacking the invasion.

I reviewed the game myself and added comments throughout the game, indicating my thinking behind the moves. I found no really big mistakes. At the end I have put a few concrete questions, but I would also appreciate it if you could just point out general mistakes in my play.

Thanks];B[pp]C[Dudzik: Hi, I'm Dudzik[1d\] and I'll be your reviewer for today!

Disclaimer: I have no idea what I am talking about.  But if you listen to me you may get stronger.

In short, you missed some important global vital points and let your opponent's moyo get out of control.

You also played some premature endgame moves, falling behind a bit more, and when you finally invaded, it was too late and you did not play flexibly enough.  You should have gotten killed, but even living was not enough by then.

That is not to say that the game was a complete disaster, but you were behind for most of the game, and missed a few key chances to turn the game around.]

C[Dudzik: If you want to avoid this modern Korean stuff, you can always hane at A before this invasion.  I think it's a little simpler.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[po];W[pr]C[Dudzik: I don't really know this joseki, but it seems like you're hurting the O3 stone here. (L3 would have been a perfect extension later)]
;B[or];W[qr];B[oq]TR[pr]C[RS: I messed up on this joseki, now the result looks worse than with the standard 3-3 invasion.

Dudzik: Yes, this doesn't seem great for white.  Q2 was a mistake.  S6 seems slow for white, but it's painful (and sente!) for black to play there.]
;W[cj];B[ej];W[cg]LB[cm:A]C[Dudzik: You could consider playing at A to take a little air out of black's moyo. (of course, it's more dangerous)]
;B[fc];W[dc]LB[qg:A][cm:B][ep:C]C[RS: I thought about kicking with E17, but I don't want to strengthen the black stone on "my" side. Also I'd like to play solid because of the large knights shimari.

Dudzik: I like this move locally, but I would probably consider doing something about black's moyo--A, B, or C, for instance.]

(;B[jc]C[RS: This seems one point too far, but I see no straightforward way of exploiting this right now, so I just approach from the outside, making black defend.

Dudzik: It's not necessarily a bad move.  The two space extension is a little heavy for black here. (see the variation)]
;W[mc]LB[qg:A][ep:B]C[Dudzik: I think this move is too early.  I know that you're thinking about attacking these stones, but look at black's moyo.  It seems very important to get a move around A.  It's also the most empty area of the board (7 lines of territory, compared with 5 on the top)  B might be even more important, though.]
;B[qf];W[qd]LB[hc:D][of:A][cm:C][ep:B]C[RS: Just play solid, again taking a large corner. This move also threatens the R14 stone, and black is still owing a move at the top.

Dudzik: This is too slow now.  Time to do something about black's moyo.  I would consider A, B, C, or D before this move. (the idea of D is to run into black's moyo while attacking)]
;B[of];W[ne]LB[mf:A][mg:B][nh:C]C[Dudzik: You are helping black to build his moyo.  If you want to play near here, you should play, for example, A, B, or C, so that black can't easily close everything.]
;B[nf];W[me];B[rn];W[rp];B[lg]C[Dudzik: I would be pretty happy with this game if I were black.]
;W[kf]
(;B[jj]C[RS: This was originally planned as a leaning attack, to build strength for a top invasion. But if black had just defended the top instead of this move, I would have accomplished nothing.

Dudzik: Leaning attacks only work when you have a severe follow-up.  And leaning against a moyo is usually a bad idea--then it becomes territory, and you have to kill big to make up for it.

Also, even if you swallow black on the top, you are still behind.]
;W[hc]LB[jo:B][ep:A][jp:C]C[Dudzik:  A is a very important move.  But it may already be necessary to go deeper--B or C, for example. (it's dangerous, but black is so big otherwise!)]
;B[fe];W[he];B[id]C[Dudzik: This is a very bad move for black.  He can't save both groups and he's making you stronger.]
;W[hd];B[lf];W[ke];B[le];W[ld];B[eb];W[db];B[da];W[ca]C[Dudzik: This is almost endgame.  If he moves into the corner, he can get at most one eye in gote.  But it's not as bad...]
;B[ea];W[bb]LB[fd:B][df:A]C[Dudzik: ...as this move.  He can't get *any* eyes in the corner now if you tenuki.  Actually, if you think of this as fixing white's shape, it is not so bad, but a move at A could be faster.  In any case, you should be eagerly awaiting the chance to cut at B. (locally, that is--globally you should still be keeping your eye on the moyo)]
;B[fg];W[hg];B[di];W[ci];B[gb];W[hb];B[re];W[rd]LB[ep:A]TR[re]
C[Dudzik: Unlike the left side, where there were eyeshape issues, this move is 100% bone fide endgame.  It's not as big as it looks.  Compare this to a move at A.

What's more, the triangled point should be double sente in the endgame.  If you let him play it now, you lose your chance to play it later.  So S15 is basically a trick move at this stage... don't respond!]
;B[sd];W[sc]C[Dudzik: Tiny.  Very tiny.];B[se];W[rc]C[Super-duper tiny.]
;B[ep];W[cm]C[Dudzik: Probably the best choice, but you're way behind now.]
;B[df]C[Dudzik: Black fixes his cutting point at F16 in sente.]
;W[cf];B[de];W[ce];B[gi]LB[rc:4][qd:2][ne:3][jq:A][pr:1]C[RS: Now I have a problem. Black has a HUGE moyo.

A quick count (I actually did count at this point in the game, and came to the same conclusion as in the review):
White has about 75 points solid territory, with not much potential to gain more. Black has about 80 points if I count the bottom and right moyo up to the 4th line. This means I have to destroy all of the center to win.

Dudzik: It looks to me that you need to try a deep invasion of the bottom.

Let's review what went wrong:

1: Damaged the O3 stone so that white ended up painfully sealed in in the lower right.

2: Let black jump to build the right side.

3: Forced black to build the right side further.

4: The final critical mistake--should have invaded the lower left.]
;W[kq]C[RS: I chose this spot for the invasion because there is already a stone there as support.

Dudzik: It's not bad.  But it's going to be hard.];B[jo];W[ko]
;B[lp];W[jp];B[kp];W[ip];B[jq];W[lq];B[hq];W[ho]LB[mp:A]C[Dudzik: These stones are not important.  Saving them is a very bad idea.  Starting at A to try to save the bottom side (while breaking into the center) seems like the only hope here.]
;B[lo];W[kn];B[jn];W[in]TR[ip][jp]C[Dudzik: This move really helps black.  Again, the triangled stones are not important.]
;B[jm];W[fn];B[hp];W[io];B[go];W[gn];B[im];W[hn];B[fo];W[em]
LB[en:A]TR[ip][jp]C[RS: Pfew. One group safe. As I see it, I still have to make life with either L6 or M3, or at least use their aji for another invasion.

Dudzik: Your L3 stones were more important to save, and they're doomed now.  Incidentally, I think that A is better shape here.]
;B[dl];W[dk]LB[bn:A]C[Dudzik: It's bad shape.  You have a better move--A.]
;B[el];W[cl]LB[bn:A]C[Dudzik: Still should be A.  Now he's going to cut you!]
;B[dm];W[dn];B[ek]
(;W[do]C[PS: Neccessary, but probably at the wrong spot (see var).

Dudzik: Black could have cut on the previous move, so you got lucky here.  I agree that this move is bad for endgame compared with C5.]
;B[dp];W[lm]TR[ip][jp]C[RS: Now let's pull out this group. If this lives, the game should be close ;)

Dudzik: Impossible.  You stamped out all the possibilities here while saving your triangled stones.]
;B[ln];W[km];B[no];W[jl];B[il];W[kk]
(;B[jk]C[RS: I think this was a mistake. After the game I talked about this situation with my opponent and he said he was afraid of the top left group dying, but I don't think there is any danger...

Dudzik: I don't think it matters.];W[li];B[kg];W[kj];B[ji];W[mn]
;B[np];W[ml];B[kl];W[ll];B[nh]TR[mj]C[Dudzik: Black should destroy white's shape, but I think white is still dead this way.]
;W[ni];B[oi]TR[oh]C[Dudzik: Black should extend here, this hane gives you forcing moves.]
;W[nj];B[oj];W[ok];B[pk]C[Dudzik: Black is getting impatient.]
;W[ol];B[nn]TR[nm]C[Dudzik: Black should have played O7.  Black almost lost the game with this move.]
;W[nm]C[RS: Alive ;)

Now I really archieved my goal of destroying the whole center, so the game should be close again. I probably should have verified this in the game by counting, then I would have payed more attention to endgame :P

Dudzik: Let's see how the endgame went...];B[bn]
(;W[cn]LB[bo:A]C[Dudzik: A seems to be much better endgame--see the variation. (this is very important--I didn't find any other serious mistakes in the endgame)]
;B[bo];W[bm];B[ha];W[ia];B[ga];W[ib]
(;B[oe];W[od];B[eo];W[en];B[gf];W[ie]LB[fd:A][rm:B]C[Dudzik: Can black escape here?  I don't think so.  Play A or B instead.]
;B[qm];W[fd]C[flOvermind: Now studying tesuji finally pays off ;)

Dudzik: Big endgame. :)];B[ed];W[ec];B[gd];W[fb];B[gc];W[fa]
C[flOvermind: Now there are just endgame moves left...

Dudzik: It's been the endgame for the past twenty moves.  The move you just played, for example, was 8 points gote.]

C[RS: Game losing mistake :P

Seriously: Even though I could have won this game by paying more attention in the endgame, I still feel there were a lot of huge mistakes before, and this close result is not really deserved.

Dudzik: Actually, the game was miscounted.  You would have lost even if you played C5 here.]

[is][js][ks][ls][ms]C[flOvermind: Black won by just 0.5 points. I'm very surprised I managed to make the game this close again, after the bad fuseki.

I'm really confused about this game.

First there is the fuseki: What were my mistakes? Why did I get as far behind? Or, more important, how far behind did I actually get? I'm still not sure how to evaluate the position when I'm faced with such a huge moyo.

Dudzik: Even pros have a hard time evaluating the value of a huge moyo.  But a good guideline is that about a third of it will become territory.  And in general if you have been sealed in in a lot of places, and you do not have a very high position, you are behind.

Which leads to the next point, the middle game: Were my invasions reasonable? If yes, then I massively overestimated the value of blacks moyo. But it seems to me I got extremely lucky that two out of three groups survived. Which other options would have been better?

Dudzik: Your first invasion was unreasonable, your second should have had no chance.

Thanks for your time, and I'm looking forward to your review.

Dudzik: I've already mentioned several areas of possible improvement, but the most important is to try a bit harder to avoid slow moves.  You had many good ideas, but many would have been better a few moves earlier.

And reading!  C8 in particular was a big mistake that could easily have cost you the game.

Hope this all made sense, and feel free to email me with any questions.

Happy studying! :)])
