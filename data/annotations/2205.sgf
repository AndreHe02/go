C[X: (I'll preface my (Xopods') comments with X, so as not to confuse them with the reviewer's.

Dear Reviewer,

Until about a week and a half ago, I was hovering at 17k* on IGS.  Then something happened, and I suddenly started demolishing my opponents and soared up four ranks in four days.  I've managed to hang on to my 13k* rank so far, but I feel a bit outclassed.  My games seem to fall into two categories... fairly calm games where I plod along to a 10-15 point loss due to superior strategy by my opponents, and the age-old "fall 10 points behind, then complicate things like crazy in the late middle game and rely on my decent fighting skills to somehow kill a few stones here and there and win."

In other words, the other 13k*s are better than I am.  The thing is, when I was up around 20k, improvement came in the form of "Try to think a bit and not make moves I know are wrong."  Now, I've pretty much stopped making mistakes that are obvious to me, and I feel like I did when I first started playing Go... that is, I'm losing, and I can't really figure out why.    This game was typical of my games these days.  I was white, and he seemed to be off to an early lead.  Then I managed a splitting attack on two of his groups and build what I thought was an impressive moyo.  Then he managed to reduce the heck out of it and I ended up with almost nothing.  He won by 14.5, even counting my 5.5 komi.

My only specific question is how I could better handle pincers, since this particular opponent seems to enjoy playing them, and I seemed to come out behind when he did so.  Other than that, my general question is... "What happened?"]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk]C[X: I don't think I've even seen this opening before.  It's like high Chinese, except that the stone which is usually at Q16 is at R16 before.  Is this at all common, or is this guy just experimenting with something weird?

I don't recognize it.];W[oc];B[mc]C[X: Here's a pincer.  I don't think I handled it very well.]
;W[oe];B[qf]C[This move is actually a mistake on black's part. It should be Q14 or possibly R13; this is too timid.]
;W[me]C[X: Maybe this move is wrong?  The first ikken tobi jump is pretty obvious, as is his response, but I'm never sure what to do afterwards.

The key point is R17. You need to make use of the easier life in the corner when you are relatively weak like this. If you want to attack, a counter pincer would be better.

Remember that the corner and sides are more valuable because the side of the board helps you (since you can't be attacked from over there, and it's easier to make life). So anytime you don't go for the corner or the side you should have a good reason.]
;B[jc]C[X: Now he has a base, so I can't really attack the pincer stone at all.  Maybe I should have counter-pincered after jumping once?  But then I'd have two weak groups...

counter pincering would have been ok];W[pi]C[X: This move felt a bit strange, but I figured that my P17 group wasn't TOO weak, and could probably take care of itself for a bit.  He probably wouldn't want to let me in his moyo, so he'd probably connect under and let me build some thickness?

In retrospect, this is probably the game losing move.

This is a bad move. You need to secure the base for your upper group.]
;B[qi];W[ph];B[qh];W[og]C[X: O12 better shape, right? Or Q10 first...]
;B[pj]C[X: Went about as I predicted, but I think I let him get too much territory, and didn't get enough in return.  Anyway, my group is pretty safe, but I already wasn't feeling too great about this game.  Like I said, in retrospect, the game was probably already lost.  I think I played pretty well for the rest of the game... considering the situation now, 15 point loss is not so bad.

So... how should I have handled the pincer?  The 17k*s I used to play against were usually too timid to pincer, except in situations where they were so strong locally that just living would be enough for me.  I have no idea how to live AND get something out of the situation when pincered.

The corner, and a base for your stones, is what was missing, I think. Notice that you don't have any territory to speack of, while he has a lot.]
;W[qo]C[X: Decided to invade, before his territory could get too big.]
;B[qm]C[X: This time, he was obviously going to pincer.];W[oo]
;B[np];W[op]C[X: Poor move, I suppose.  Shoulda remembered that pushing into keima is almost always wrong.  I just wanted to secure my connection a little more, since he's so strong in the vicinity that cutting ikken tobi might actually become feasible for him.

Joseki is M3, although black is so strong above it might be better to go to R3 and try to make life immediately.]
;B[oq];W[nn];B[kq];W[rq];B[qr];W[rm];B[rn];W[qn];B[rl];W[pm]
;B[ql];W[ro];B[sm];W[dj]C[X: Everything of mine safe, so might as well take a big point.  Maybe san-ren-sei wasn't the right structure to make, though.  It's a fighting formation, and all the groups on the board seem pretty strong right now.

I actually like what you did in this sequence. You have strength into the center, and can't be easily sealed in.]
;B[fq]C[X: Obviously *I* can't pincer, since he has a stone at L3...

You could still pincer; the pincer stone would be light and have a lot of life.  Just don't try to save it at any cost.]
;W[dn];B[cf]C[X: Wrong side for him?

I think so.];W[ch]C[X: Trying to give him a taste of his own medicine... pincer seemed the correct choice in the situation.

This is fine.];B[bd]C[X: I read the other day that this slide is wrong.

because you have D10, it's not so bad.];W[cc];B[bc];W[gc]C[X: Beginning to orchestrate something resembling a splitting attack.  But maybe his top left corner group is weaker... should I have played e.g. E13 instead?  Or maybe I should have applied MORE pressure and tried to make it a leaning attack.  Perhaps a shoulder hit at J16 and THEN attack the top left corner?

I don't like E13 here. J16 might be a good move. H17 would also be relatively severe and a good preparation for a corner attack.]
;B[ef];W[ge]C[X: Keeping him divided...];B[cq];W[cp]C[X: Better to let him take some territory and get more thickness facing the top left, where the action is, right?

No, I think this is too timid. You are strong above.

B18 is probably sente and useful];B[dq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[go]
;W[fh]C[X: All of a sudden, the game is looking not so bad any more.  He has two weakish groups (top left much weaker than K17-N17, though), I have a big moyo on the left, and the center looks somewhat promising.  Big problem for me though is that my center is open around Q10 and G5, and he has an awful lot of territory on the bottom and right.]
;B[bh];W[bi];B[bg];W[je]C[X: Looked like a good move.];B[id]
;W[ie];B[hd];W[gd];B[he];W[hf]C[X: I don't think these moves were good for black.  He just strengthens my moyo.

agreed. But it is a small moyo so far.];B[gf];W[gg];B[ff]C[X: On the other hand, he does cut off my small top left group...]
;W[ig]C[X: Necessary, right?

I think it is a good move];B[ed];W[ec];B[nd];W[od];B[ne];W[nf]
;B[nc];W[qc]C[X: Too small at this point?  Maybe G6 or... I don't know... something to try to close my moyo on the right... P10?  O11?  N9?

I still like B18 as a sente move that makes your top group stronger and threatens his weak group.

But I don't think this is a small move.];B[rc];W[qb];B[nb];W[ob]
C[X: Definitely too small.  What was I thinking?

agreed];B[hb];W[gb]C[X: This, on the other hand, is necessary, or else that group will be in trouble.]
;B[hc];W[fd];B[ee];W[bb];B[cd];W[db];B[de];W[dc]C[X: Probably unneccessary.  I was worried about the group's life, but I think it would have been fine.

I think also it would have been fine without this.];B[ab];W[ba]
C[X: Again, probably not necessary.];B[nj]C[X: And now, predictably, he begins to take away everything I built.]
;W[gn]C[X: Right?

fine];B[lj];W[ij]C[X: Realising that I wasn't going to get much in the centre, I tried to make the left as big as possible.

I think attacking into the bottom is more important.

I think you tend to overvalue the center.];B[dh];W[di];B[eh]
;W[fj];B[ei];W[fi];B[ej];W[ek];B[dk];W[ck];B[dl];W[cl];B[bp]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[cn];B[rr];W[ln]C[X: Suddenly realised that this group was in danger now.]
;B[mm];W[mn];B[kl];W[jn];B[il];W[jm];B[jl];W[hn]C[X: It's safe now, but I let him eat even further into my moyo.]
;B[fk];W[el];B[fl];W[em];B[fm];W[fn]C[You should let him have this cut and instead attack at H8. Your stones were safe and well connected.]
;B[hl];W[rb];B[rd];W[iq]TR[hn][jn][iq]C[X: At least, in the process of destroying my moyo, he let me build up the potential to reduce his bottom... this is the right depth, isn't it?  Seemed like the horse head of the marked stones made the right shape.

Looks good];B[hq];W[jp];B[kp];W[ir];B[hr];W[ko];B[jr];W[hs]
;B[gs];W[is];B[fr];W[hp];B[js];W[ho]C[G3 is a little better since it forces black to make a dumpling.]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[eq];W[gq];B[gr];W[mp];B[mq];W[lp];B[lq];W[no]
;B[nq]C[X: I felt pretty good about this sequence.  His territory looks much smaller than it used to.  Not that I have all that much, either.]

;W[hi];B[ik];W[gk]C[X: Seeing things that aren't there...];B[hk]
;W[jj]C[I like M11 better, because it threatens both N11 and L10.]
;B[kj];W[li];B[mi];W[oi];B[oj];W[ha];B[ia];W[ga];B[jb];W[na]

;W[la]C[X: Oh, clever me!  I can get a ko for his whole group!  Except... I can't.  Again, seeing things that aren't there.]
;B[mb];W[kb];B[kc];W[ja]C[X: For some reason, I expected him to capture, rather than just connecting.  Silly me.]
;B[ib];W[tt];B[ok];W[tt];B[hm];W[tt];B[oh];W[tt];B[sa]
;C[The end.  I lose.

I think the overall aswer to, "What's going on?" is that you are overvaluing the center versus the sides and corners.

You are also sometimes too timid.]TW[ca][da][ea][fa][pa][qa]
