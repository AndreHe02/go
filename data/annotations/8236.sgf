C[Dear Reviewer,
My name is Avi, playing white in this game.

Please help me find major mistakes in my game, omments on both sides are welcome.

Thanks!

Hello Avi, I'm Thomas, your reviewer. Both sides played quite well in this game but you comitted two major mistakes that made you loose the game (as described later).
I sincerly hope you will enjoy the review and don't hesitate to mail me back if you have any question.]

(;W[hc]C[Thomas : good idea];B[fe];W[df];B[id]LB[hc:A]C[Thomas : This move is just wrong. Black want to attack your A stone in order to use effectively the stone he put at the tengen.]

LB[jj:A][pj:B]C[I guess until last move (P15) it is standard opening, is not it? Black P15 looks a bit slow to me, what do you say?

Thomas : Actually, I really prefer white here since you have secure points on the top side and that tha A and B stones are too close to wall o build a real moyo.
Besides, you keep the initiative.
About p15, although this move is a little bit slow, it is absolutly mandatory in black strategy.]
;W[nq]C[Thomas : here i would consider invading immediatly, but i think your move is ok.]
;B[no];W[mp];B[ob];W[nb];B[ln]C[This is the first key position. Black build a very big moyo on the right side. Is my next move the right direction?]
(;W[kl]C[Thomas : wrong move. You want to invade black's moyo, not to erase it. In order to do that you should invade deeply (generally on th e 3rd line)]
;B[jn];W[il];B[hn];W[ml];B[nm]C[Thomas : strange move. It does nothing really well.]

Thomas : i don't like this cut. you try to exploit black's weaknesses here but you are not strong enough to do so.]
;B[kp]C[This was quite severe...

Thomas : this is the usual move.];W[gn];B[fo];W[hq];B[hl];W[fm]
;B[ik]LB[io:A][kl:B]C[Here I struggled to live, and my feeling is that Black took the initiative.

Thomas : i agree yu are a lot behind here. it seems to me that during the last sequence of moves (from A to now), you forgot to consider your B group and the whole center.
When playing a moyo game, you always have to keep in mind the moyo and eventually your weak groups.]

(;W[kg]C[I am not so sure about this move, because it allows Black to take a major point (see next move). Should I have played D12 myself? I think the the white center group can still live because of the J11 threat.

Thomas : i think this move is mandatory];B[dh]LB[kl:A][gp:B]
C[Now seems to me Black leads the game. Black's moyo is very solide, ulike White's. Also the Black's F5 is not dead yet, as was shown later in the game.

Please help me understand my mistakes.

Thanks!

Thomas : i agree now you are too much behind to have a chance to win.
You comitted 2 big mistakes in this game : the first one is the A move, when you tried to erase black's moyo instead of invade it ; the other one being the cut at B, where you are starting a fight when you still have a weak group in the middle and a mot-so-strong group on the bottom side : this kind of fight is exactly what black is looking for in a moyo game. That explains why you immediatly behind after these moves.
My final advices : 
1) always keep in mid the moyo while playing a moyo game. Probably that would have prevented you last mistake.
2) When you are invading, do so deeply !

(;W[iq]LB[qq:A][io:B]C[Thomas : i would probably play here. Although it may seem slow, your group is definitly strong after that and the sansan is still opened and there is still a weakness at B]
))
(;W[qh]C[Thomas : what about playing here ? Let's be clear : black will probably kill this stone but our goal is to make him suffer everywhere else.
The general idea being 'invade deeply' is not to make the invading stone live but to let your opponent choose if he prefers to let this stone live inside his moyo or if he prefers to see his moyo completly crushed while trying to kill this stone.
Actually, when you 'invade deeply', you don't have to think a lot. Fan Hui used to say that in this kind of situation he 'closes his eyes and puts the stone on the board']

(;B[jd]C[Thomas : This is the usual play. As far as I remember this is considered as being good for black.]
