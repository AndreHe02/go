C[Dear Reviewer,

First thank you so much for reviewing my game.

I think I played a strong opening up to the point that my opponent had three week groups. Then in the end I had a moment of not reading a simple life and death and lost a group on the left. (If I would have taken one extra moment and would I read and saved that group. If I had not made that one mistake I belive it was a close game until the end.)

All my opponents groups servived so I know I did a mistake. I found one way to kill bottom right corrner but please let me know how I could have better used the three weak groups. (I have a few questions throughout the game.)

Vose playing Black.

my thoughts too. The thing about aji is that there aren't any fixed ways to use them, but I'll keep a lookout!]

I would have preferred B Tenuki. Or even P4];W[rn];B[on]C[this is the vital point, but the timing doesn't feel right yet. If I were W I'd ignore the group and play somewhere bigger.

A good rule of thumb, especially in the opening, is that if a move feels painful to play (like W Q6 in this instance), just play on a big point.]
;W[pn]C[This is just too painful for W lol];B[nq]C[I would say This is now a weak group.

Yes it is. But there's still some bad aji going on here. I wouldn't try too hard to kill the W group, maybe just harass it to make territory along the bottom side.]

In a way, yes, since both your N6 and Q3 groups are not in immediate danger. However, when attacking the bottom left, you have 2 choices of direction. Perhaps F3 would have been better, since it prevents W from linking up too easily]

not necessarily. W C12 is a very severe move, given the strong W group at the top left.
But things are getting worse for the W M4 group, so its still quite a good situation for B]

(;B[kp]C[I did this extra one to make sure my group had enough liberties for a race. Was this good thinking or bad?

Playing L5 leads to W escaping anyway, so i guess your thinking is on the right track.
However, move 71 B K4 would have saved you a lot of headache...]
;W[ko];B[lo];W[mo];B[ln]C[From here on, B has to keep in mind that the longer the battle drags out, the worse things become for the bottom B group. And if that group dies, the W M4 group lives.]
;W[im]
(;B[hn]C[Keep the presure and no eyes

Good thinking, but slightly off. See next move];W[jm]C[This is W's natural reaction.

Now B has a bad shape: "peeping at a bamboo joint"];B[gl];W[fk]
;B[ej]SQ[mn][do]C[Now thinking to make sure there is still three weak groups. I don't think that my two groups are weak yet but what do you think? Squares

The B groups aren't as strong as I'm comfortable with, but perhaps that's just my playstyle...
You need to keep in mind that if W kills ANY of your groups, the tables will have turned. In fact, given that the W J5 group now has effecctively unlimited liberties, the B K4 group is dead, meaning ALL the W groups in the area are alive, which in turn means that all the B groups in the area are weak, or even dead.]
;W[fj];B[ei];W[fi]
(;B[eh];W[bb]
(;B[hl];W[jk];B[hj];W[fh];B[fg]C[Good or bad?

It's already very hard to kill the W F10 group anytime soon, so B's priority should be to:
1) keep the B left side group alive
2) Keep SOME of the G6 group alive.];W[hh];B[ij];W[jj];B[ih]
;W[gg]C[Good move by W. So by thinking backwards, B J12 might have been a bad move.]

(;B[ji]TR[gg][fh][hh]C[We both bulged is that ok?

once again, B needs to consider his objectives:
1) Kill W F9 group / Keep B E12 group alive
2) Kill W K9 group / Keep B H8 group alive

But since B K4 group has too few liberties left, objective (2) is almost impossible to achieve. Thus, B should focus on (1).

However, due to the previous sequence of moves resulting in the triangled W shape, it's very hard to kill the W group. This means both the B H10 group and E11 group are in danger.

So considering all of the above, W playing the bulge was a very good move. For B, however, you need to choose:
1) Play K11 and hope the E11 group survives
2) Play something like C12 and hope the J10 group survives

Thinking along these lines, you might spot moves like B9 (see variation) which might be the best move here.]
;W[lj]
(;B[mk]LB[ll:1]TR[lj][jk][jm]C[I wanted pressure and keep my group connected but I thought about 1 as a posible move

No, 1 is too slow considering that the N6 group has a length of 5 stones. Also, although it is generally to play at 1 to deny W of a good shape (triangles and 1), in this case B could end up dead (see variation)]

Looks correct, but I might have missed something.

Main question is how should I have used the three w weak groups.

Thank you,

Okay as mentioned earlier, the 3 W "weak" groups weren't very weak. Yes they had no eyes, but neither did your attacking groups. Weakness is relative. In fact, I used to be a fan of W's playstyle (throw groups all over the place, give them up if necessary since they are light, and when the opponent makes a mistake, BOOM! I reinforce the few vital "weak" stones and suddenly the tables turn)

It is good that you were looking to exploit W's weakness, but you must take care not to get confused. Keep a clear list of priorities and objectives. This is the difference between being flexible ("oh you're focusing all your efforts into keeping this left group alive? Guess I'll kill this bottom group right here then, since it's just beside my strong attacking stones") and being inconsistant ("2 moves to attack the left, 2 moves to attack the bottom, 2 moves to... oh wait he just counter-attacked... I'm cut up...damnit I'm dead")

Other than the life-death mistake and endgame mistakes, the main issue with your play is what I just mentioned. Try reviewing your games with the opponent after every game; knowing what he was thinking, especially at the early-mid game stages, will help you tremendously.

Cheers!
