C[Hello dear reviewer.

I really liked this game as it was a very close one. I would like you to point out my biggest mistakes in the opening and all along the game.

And if you want and have the time, I would like some advices on the yose, because I felt like my opponent played the biggest points while I was only answering

My comments will be mark as CB ^^

Thanks for the review and the time spent on this !

df: My comments will be marked df.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[fq]
(;W[ip]C[[CB\] I rarely have this kind of pincer played by my opponent. I choose the easy way by taking the san-san. Is there a better option ?

df: the white pincer is unusual.  Normally you want a stone of your color behind so the pincer move also helps to build a framework. I think taking the corner is fine.  The alternative is to jump out and leave the pincer stone weak.]
(;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[nq]
LB[kq:A]C[[CB\] I was waiting for f4 by white and felt confused. Should I invade right now ?

df: f4 would be too tight since you would have the extension to A.  You already gained something from white's unusual pincer because he is approaching your lower right corner from the wrong side.  His extension to O3 is one space longer than normal, so it will be easy to invade behind it later unless he adds a move. If he adds a move (say M4), he is not getting enough for the stones here.

There is no need to invade now.  Just defend the corner.  The long extension leaves an easy invasion.  Becasue he didn't move at F4, you can easily do something on that side too.  His shape on the bottom is thin, so there is no hurry to invade.]
(;B[po];W[no]LB[pm:A][lq:B]TR[po][do][dp][dq][eq][er]SQ[nr]
[lo][iq]C[df: since you made the marked high move, you can consider responding at A, to make a large territory on the right side.

When thinking about the lower side invasion, first decide if the marked white group is weak or strong.  If you feel it is weak, move on the left side, but plan your moves to attack it. If you feel the white group is strong, you want to invade on the right side, around B, since it is better to invade where your opponent is weaker.

B  is a nice invasion point, since it has several follow up moves, to connect to the corner, run out while attacking, or attach to a stone (marked with squares).

Your choice of playing on the left indicates you think the marked white group is weak, but then you jsut run away rather than attacking.

You shouold not be thinking about just saving your one stone at F3.   You shoul be making a plan to invade the lower side, and the F3 stone will be part of that plan, but not the starting point of your thinking.]
(;B[gp]TR[dn][do][ip]C[[CB\] Well, I'm not sure the timing is good, and I'm not sure saving this stone helps me a lot. I tried to split white and not let him make a lot of point on the side...

df: I don't like this shape.  Diagonal moves leave forcing moves for the opponent behind and aren't very fast.  You can attack the big white group to move out faster.   Since white can force at D6, your move does not get your group outside of the line connecting the marked points.]
;W[dn];B[cm];W[gn]C[df: good attacking sequence.  White can expect to get thick on the outside now.]
;B[ho];W[im]C[df: good attacking move.]
(;B[io];W[jp]
(;B[jn]LB[jo:A]C[df: I don't like this shape, but A (the usual shape) leads to a difficult fight.  I put in a few variations after A, but I doubt they are best.  The result will depend on the fighting strengths.]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[mm]TR[jp][ip]C[df: another good attacking move.  The peep at N4 is good if it ends up capturing the marked stones.]
(;B[fr];W[fs]
(;B[lp]LB[mp:A]C[df: I like the peep at A first.  If white connects it shoudl be better than the game (see prior variations).]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[mq];B[kp];W[kq];B[np]
(;W[op]
(;B[ln];W[oo];B[oq]C[df: the push at Q4 is too severe.  This cut won't work.   Black is in big trouble here.]
;W[pp]C[[CB\] Q5 would have been better at R5 now ^^];B[qp]
;W[qq];B[nn];W[mn];B[ll]
(;W[ml]C[df: I'm not sure what white is afraid of here.  It seems that if white cuts at M7, black will likely collapse.]

(;B[qk]C[df: the cut is the more usual continuation here.];W[rj]
;B[rk];W[qf]
(;B[qe]LB[qi:B][qh:A]C[df: usualy this kick is used to make white heavy in order to attack.  it makes white strogner and doesn;t secure the corner very well, so in this situation I would not play here.

df: after this play you should be aiming at A or B, after cutting at O11.]
;W[pf];B[nc];W[go];B[hp];W[in];B[jo];W[lo]C[[CB\] Only 8 points, I'm sure there's a better play somewhere !

df: yes.]
(;B[dm]C[[CB\] But maybe not this one... I misread the cut so this move was not sente at all !]
;W[fm]C[df: after your turn, you can make some nice territory on the left side.]
(;B[en]
(;W[eo];B[em];W[fn];B[fp]C[df: this move gains nothing, so you should keep it as a ko threat.]
;W[fo];B[ce];W[co]C[df: this move is bad.  It fills white's liberty and has no effect on black.  It should be saved as a ko threat.]
;B[bo];W[dk]
(;B[el]C[[CB\] bad shape for bad shape...

df: E9 is better shape and nicely cuts the two weak white groups.]
;W[fj]C[df: this white move is good for attack, but weak at defense. You can attack the big white group now.]
(;B[ch];W[di];B[jl]C[df: This move is way too slow.  it would be ok if you were far ahead, but the game is still very close.  It strengthen's white, so you won't be able to attack it later.]
;W[il];B[lk];W[mk];B[jk]C[[CB\] no more a burden ! I know it's really small, maybe I should have simply jump... But I felt a lot more comfortable after this

df: your group wasn't much of a burden since the neighboring white group wan't very strong.   Although since he let you live with sente, it is not so bad.]

;W[lc];B[kd];W[md];B[lf];W[mf];B[le];W[me];B[ni]C[df: good.]
;W[nh]
(;B[gd]LB[id:A]TR[kd]C[df: you can continue from your earlier move and cut off the right group (N12).

df: I don't understand the point of this move.  You have a weak group.  You might need the move at A to strengthen it.  Playing on the other side creates another weak stone and helps white get strogner.]
