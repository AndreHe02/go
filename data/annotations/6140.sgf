AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi Istrof (W),

I'm Jamie (5kyu at KGS) and I'll be reviewing your game.

Overall my feeling is that you created some weak groups and tried to settle them in a way that reinforced Black's position around you.

This meant Black retained a lead into the middle game where you were stuck having to defend at a time when stronger groups would have allowed you more attacking freedom.]
;W[nq];B[qn]
(;W[no]C[[J\] This makes your group an immediate target, with no base.

Black has a safe group to the right and the opportunity for a dual purpose play on the left, achieving both a nice extension and a severe attack.]
;B[jp];W[kq]C[[J\] This move forces B to play a strong pillar making it easy for black to convert the bottom left to territory.]
;B[jq]
(;W[kp]C[Maybe this was a little bit slow. Better R10?

[J\] Yes, I agree, you seem to be falling further behind Black here, however I don't like R10 much (see var).]
;B[pj]
(;W[cj]C[[J\] I dislike this move in 4 stone handicap games. It just doesn't feel active enough. Black can ignore it or response by settling either of the corners.]
;B[cf];W[cn]LB[cl:a]C[[J\] These two are not well connected, white will have trouble with the weakness at A.]
;B[fq];W[ch]
(;B[jd]
(;W[fc]C[I think this one came a bit late, should have invaded earlier.

[J\] Yes, having spent three moves on the left side you are a move late getting up here. Playing here now only really hurts white.]
;B[ec]
(;W[ic]C[[J\] Again forcing B to play a nice (from Black's point of view) pillar.]
;B[jc];W[id];B[fn];W[cp];B[cq]
(;W[bp]C[[J\] Too submissive];B[do];W[co];B[dq]
(;W[fe]C[A bit slow? Better F14?

[J\] No, this seems ok, definitely better than F14 (see var)]
;B[ef];W[ff];B[eg]
(;W[qf]TR[fe][ff]C[[J\] The purpose of the two stones (F14 & 15) is lost given your switch to the right side.]
;B[nd];W[qi]C[[J\] Forcing Black to play a nice pillar again.]
;B[qj];W[ri]C[[J\] Again the submissive move to live small on the side.]

;B[qr];W[rk];B[rl]
(;W[rj]C[[J\] Missed opportunity];B[qk];W[rb]LB[cl:a]C[[J\] Ends in gote.

It's difficult for me to say where is good for white at the moment. The weakness at A is still serious.]
;B[qb];W[qa];B[pa];W[rc]
(;B[kh]C[This move showed me, that I had ignored the center to long.

[J\] This move by black is very single-mindedly focused on taking profit, not normally a good thing. With so many white groups being weak I feel black could have made much better progress by attacking each of your groups.]

(;W[kn]C[To Slow again?

[J\] I'd hane (see var).];B[im];W[in]LB[jo:a]C[[J\] Creates a weakness at A, I don't see an immediate benefit for Black here ... but later.]
;B[hm];W[ho];B[hq];W[jg];B[kg];W[jh];B[ji];W[gh];B[ei];W[eh]
;B[dh];W[fh];B[di];W[gk]
(;B[ek];W[dl]C[[J\] This really has been a dangerous spot for you for a while, luckily Black never used it.]
;B[el];W[dm];B[em];W[fj];B[ej];W[mj]C[[J\] The general idea behind what you were doing here is good. It's a little open to attack but you created a potentially profitable area by making Black defend feel a need to defend.]
;B[mh];W[kj];B[ki];W[ni];B[nh];W[oj];B[pi];W[ol]C[[J\] Now black might exploit that weakness.]

(;B[on];W[pm];B[pn];W[nn];B[om];W[nm];B[pl];W[ok]C[[J\] From about here on it seems like you have both agreed where the territorial boundaries are to be set. This is premature (see next var).]

(;B[oh]
(;W[pe]C[[J\] Not the right place. You need to finish your nice area first.

My commentary ends here, I hope this has been of some help.]
