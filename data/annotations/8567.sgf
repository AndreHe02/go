AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi reviwer i'm black, my name is raul, this is a game played with a  6d japanese amateur player who is in cuba with educational purpose



is a honor for me that you take your time to review my game, thank you very much, all comments will be more than well received



i proposed 4 stones because even as you can see my level 1k, we (cubans) can't be sure of what actually is our level, and so i thougth i could make it with a 4 handicap game



i'm quite interested in your opinion about my stile, my way of playing, my decisions, please if you could also add some of your expiriences to improve my game, i'll be more than gratefull.

finally, please don't comment ONLY the moves i ask for, feel free to comment others too

thank you again];W[qf];B[pi];W[nc];B[oe];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[pg]C[Janr: this move is overconcentrated.  It is better to try to push white down on the third line (variation)
As illustration, see the variation to whites move next]
(;W[fc];B[cf];W[fq];B[eq]C[The attachment makes white stronger, so it is not recommended.]
;W[fp];B[cn];W[jq];B[hc]C[may be a litle aggresive??? what do you think??....

Janr: I think it is a good move (but yes, good moves are often aggressive ...)]
;W[fe];B[he]LB[kc:A]C[Janr: I would consider to play A here.  It gives the black group a base (especially useful in handicap games). 
The game move has the risk that later white gets strong and then attacks H17/H15]
;W[fg];B[dh]LB[di:A]C[but i'm happy with B20....

Janr: it is a bit narrow, often played at A.];W[kc]C[Janr: so yes, now white makes a little territory on the top while he attacks black.]
;B[hg];W[fi];B[dj]LB[di:A][hi:B]C[and with B 24

Janr: if black had played at A earlier, he may be now be better on the left and play B, not falling behind in the running battle of the two eyeless groups.]
;W[hj]C[janr: now white is ahead in the running fight and turns on blacks head.
Black failed to follow the proverb "stay ahead in the running battle"]
;B[ke]LB[hj:A]C[another option???

Janr: There are variations, but once white plays A, a painful escape is unavoidable.]
;W[ne];B[md]C[my opponent said really good];W[le];B[ld];W[kd]
;B[je];W[nd];B[me];W[mf];B[lf];W[mg];B[of]C[Janr: threatening to cut is too slow.  In the game, white runs instead of connecting.  If you really cut, white will live both on the top side and in the center and won't need a connection.

It is more urgent to defend the black groun in the top center (which doens't have real eyes yet).]
;W[mi];B[lh];W[mh];B[ii]C[i don't know if this is really necessary???

Janr: I think black is still a bit in danger, so defending does not harm.

Still, it would be better to escape instead of getting enclosed (and living locally)]
;W[ij];B[ji];W[nq]C[nice for white];B[qn]C[any other way for this move???

janr: This is ok.];W[db];B[no]LB[cc:A][fk:B]C[Janr: maybe A is better?

Playing A has the advantage that white doesn't live locally and moves like B threaten to cut.]
;W[cc];B[cd]C[Janr: I would prefer to play elsewhere now  White has eyes locally, so everything which remains must be endgame.]
;W[qq]LB[cd:A]C[Janr: This is bigger than A];B[pq];W[pr];B[or]
;W[qr];B[oq];W[ro];B[rn];W[qo];B[po];W[qp];B[kk]LB[pn:A]C[missed the big problem of A]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[ki];B[kh]LB[jj:A]C[Janr: I would prefer A as it gives access to the center.
In the game, black gets fenced in and white gets powerfull in the lower center]
;W[jj];B[li];W[kj];B[nf];W[lj];B[mj];W[mk];B[nj];W[pn]C[and there it is]
(;B[pm]C[Janr: atari is often bad.  How about the variation?]
;W[on];B[nn];W[om];B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[mm];B[mq]C[any other variations??

Janr: I'm really afraid the black group will die here.];W[nr]
;B[mr];W[np];B[mp];W[oo];B[jp];W[kq];B[ip];W[kp];B[ko];W[lo]
LB[fq:B][jq:A]TR[nn][no][mp][mq][mr]C[
Janr: I would prefer to attack black on a larger scale.  Black doesn't have eyes in the marked stones, so cutting them off is only endgame.
I would prefer to connect A with B.  
If black spends moves in connecting, he will die completely, If black escapes partially, then white is connected on the bottom.]
;B[lp];W[kn];B[jo];W[mo]C[same, any other variations for save this stones??

Janr: white gives black an opportunity to escape with some stones, so black should not be unhappy.]
;B[iq];W[lr];B[jn]C[i realizaed tis was a bad move, it did not accomplish anything and white played exactly where i was suppose to play]
(;W[fm]LB[gn:A][ho:B]C[Janr: for white I would consider A or B to limit black's eye space.  White is strong on top so white can fight strongly. 
White could also make various preparations];B[gn];W[fn];B[go]
;W[fo];B[jr];W[ms]LB[kr:A]C[i think he could've played at A instead of W109

janr: yes];B[kr];W[lq];B[hr]LB[gr:A]MA[fr]C[we analized the A,B (on marked X), and C (on 112) secuence but i liked this move because i can play (marked X) and does not hurts the corner, but white is good and saw a few moves ahead of me]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[cr];B[bp]C[i don't wanted to kill him, i'm ahead in points]
;W[bq];B[bo];W[er];B[dr];W[ds];B[fr]C[unnecesary!!!! and the begining of future complications]
;W[es];B[do];W[gr];B[dl];W[ek];B[dk];W[oh]C[this move Mr. Nishijima said "wasn't him playing", he said it was irracional

janr: white loses a lot of good endgame at the right];B[oi]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[qg];B[rd]LB[rh:A]C[we analizaed a nasty combination if black played A instead of B136, but at the end it does not work,  my opponent said this move was good]
;W[og];B[pf];W[rc];B[sc];W[sb];B[sd];W[rb]LB[rd:A]C[janr: Compare the difference with white playing A first]
;B[sn]C[40 points in solid territory on the right side, (perhaps 38)]
;W[rh];B[qi];W[re];B[ri]
(;W[od]C[Janr: white clearly does not play a good endgame by trying these moves and ending in gote.  How about the variation?]

;B[le];W[bd];B[be];W[ac];B[km]LB[la:A]C[A is bigger than B160, is sente and also avoids complications]

[hr][jr][kr]SQ[nn][no]C[excellent move !!!!!.



of course, after you've seeing black's "ortodox" game (so as my opponent, Mr. Nishijima 6d, commented) , you can tell that black will know  W161 is a threat to the marked (triangled) group...



well, black didn't.



in the game i played A capturing one stone in gote and my opponent play B... after a long-desperate-meaningless struggle i resigned, and later when commenting the game, Mr. Nishijima, call me "careless" when i played A...



after W played B i realized that was so easy to play as in the variation and calmly save the group, i do not need to save the 2 black stones (marked square) to win

i was winning and i think by a clear difference, even in yose, white could not catch up.



black has around 60 points while white has around 39]
(;B[ln]LB[gp:B]C[white played B



see variation for B162])
(;B[gq];W[fs];B[gp]C[is so fu***** easy, what was i thinking...
