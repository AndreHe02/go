C[Jens:
I've tried to advise what I would do as W as requested.  My comments are preceded with an 'R:' I've also added some variations to illustrate my points.

Generally:

There were a couple of places where I thought you were following B around the board too much.

There were a couple of times where I thought you could get your stones to work together better.  I think you perhaps could have looked for ways to approach B from the weaker W stone, pushing B towards your stronger stones.  Pushing B from a strong W group towards a weaker W group makes for problems.

I hope this helps.
Thanks
Robert];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[op]C[R: I think this a complicated way to start.  Just make a claim in the top right.]

(;W[iq]C[D16 first instead? I thought about it, but putting pressure on G3 seemed tempting.

R: I don't see a problem putting pressure on G3 but I'd attack from the other side (see my variations) building up strength in the corner (remember corner-sides-middle?).  Black gets a chance to take the top left at the risk of leaving 2-3 black stones at the bottom rather weak.]
;B[dr]
(;W[eq]C[C3 instead? Would have given black the chance to settle though...

R: Given Black's slide I prefer C3];B[er];W[cq];B[go];W[dn]
C[R: By now you can see E3 is doing anything for you.  W's shape would be better if E3 was at C2, but B would get there first in the variation.]
;B[mc];W[dd]C[R: I think you should feel happy to get here first!]
;B[di];W[ck];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[cj]C[R: I think I'd respond to this with D9 rather than start yet another W group at R14.  D3 threatens C!2, strengthens the D6 group and begins to put pressure on B's G5 group from a leaning attack.  B's G5 group is a target (a weak group) for W that I don't think you recognized at this point.  By attacking from either side you can build up W's strength.  

By this point in the game I'm feeling that W's stones haven't been working well together.]

(;W[qf]C[Maybe K17 would have been bigger? But the black moyo on the right seemed to grow too much.]
;B[qe]
(;W[of]C[Maybe I should have tried to settle first?

R:  I'd prefer Q14.  My variation prevents B from connecting underneath and creates eye space and some base.]
;B[rf];W[qg];B[rg]
(;W[oe]C[R: I don't think this does anything.  P12 begins to buld eye space]
;B[jc];W[io]C[Was it okay to leave R14/P14 group alone? I pulled it out at the end, but I wasn't sure if it was already strong enough to be left alone.

R: See previous comments. At last you attack B's weak group but this direction pushes B to the closer D11 group.]

;B[hn];W[ho];B[fo];W[en];B[fm]C[R: by this tim even tho B G5 is almost dead. B has a very strong outside wall facing the weak W stones at P14, giving them a long way to run.]
;W[hr];B[gr]C[R: I think C2 or F3 work here.]
(;W[cr];B[fq]C[R: Now F1 kills]
(;W[ep]C[I felt like strengthening my position beforee attacking, and I hoped it would prevent an eye at the bamboo link.]
;B[fs];W[ds];B[hp];W[ip]C[From what I see that was my main mistake. Should I have played H3 insteadd?

R: Yes even after all this H3 still kills tho' separating the H5-J5 stones might get you into a capturing race.]

;W[jr];B[hs]C[Could I have killed somehow? I tried, but I couldn't figure it out. Anyway, even with black alive this seemed like a fair result for both sides to me.

(;W[qc]C[What about this? I was very unsure.
I died in the end, but I thought I should be able to use the threat to connect through R15 to live somehow. Any comments on this invasion would be greatly appreciated!

R: I don't think you can expect both R17 and P14 groups to live.  It's a deep reading exercise to find a way for R17 to live too.  B can connect out in so many ways.  I'd try to push on B to make the P14 group bigger and easier to defend if B attacks.  W R12 looks like a good start instead of R17.]
