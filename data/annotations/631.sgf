;W[cf]C[White 8 is too slow and badly placed.          It makes White 6 looks like an odd move. White 6 would be better placed one step further at C9.     White 8 making a high shimari at D15 would be better.          But the biggest point on the board looks like being white 8 on the right side, at R10.]
;B[qn];W[pj];B[rp]C[Black 11 looks good.     In this position it's good feeling not to go to san-san.]
;W[nq];B[qq];W[jq];B[hq];W[cm];B[qh];W[hc];B[je];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[qd];B[qe]C[With Black 17 already in place, Black 23 is better played with keima at R14.]
;W[re];B[qf]C[With Black 17 already in place Black 25 is better played with nidan bane at S14.          The idea with Black 23 and Black 25 should be to try to make Black 17 a well placed move.]
;W[rf]C[White 26 should be hane at Q18.     If White plays 26 at Q18 , Black 17 would end up badly placed, nearly a wasted move.]
;B[qb]C[Black 27 is good. Now Black 17 will be almost ideally placed and this hane in the corner makes also very big a difference in territory.]
;W[rb];B[pb];W[rg];B[qg]C[White 30 should be hanekomi at R13 to create cutting points.     With Black 31, Black has very good (strong) shape.]
;W[mf]C[White 32 is jealous.];B[md]C[Black 33 is passive it would be better at N12.          When you play like this you don't punish White for his temerity.]
;W[he]C[White 34: Good.        Because you already played Black 33, White can now afford not to defend White 32.]
;B[kh];W[mh];B[oi]C[ This move aims to separate White 10 from White 32-36, but in this game White can afford to discard White 10. So this Black attitude only helps White group to go out.        Instead of Black 37, it would be better to play keima at M10, attacking the White stones as a whole group.        You should only cut when your opponent cannot afford to lose any of the two groups beeing cuted. Else you only help him to make sabaki.]
;W[mj];B[oj];W[ml];B[ol]C[ While Black concentrates on isolating Black 10, White group goes out.]
;W[ri]C[ Ironically, White even has time to save White 10.]
;B[rh];W[sh];B[mn];W[jk];B[lq];W[lr]C[ Up to 48 Black seems to have attacked strongly...but, in deed, he has achieved nothing.        Only he has helped his opponent to extricate from a difficult situation.        White is now ahead in the game.]
;B[kr]C[ For Black 49, it's better to cut on the right.        In this position, if you want the left, cut on the right and vice-versa.]
;W[kq];B[mr];W[lp];B[mq];W[mp];B[np];W[nr];B[ls];W[ns];B[ms]
;W[jr];B[oq];W[jo];B[jm];W[ln];B[lm];W[kn];B[mm]C[Black 67 should be connecting at L7.]
;W[km];B[ll];W[lk]C[White 70 would be better at L10 or L11. White should not push Black alternatively from the left and from the right allowing Black to cut him and leave him with bad shape.         This is very bad style.]
;B[kl];W[jl];B[kk];W[kj];B[jj];W[ki]C[White 76 shoud be atari at K11, White needs to get out.]
;B[ji]C[ It will be very difficult for White to live inside.]
;W[jh];B[im]C[Black 79 should be drawing back at L13. Black can expect to kill the upper white group but not the lower one (see the game).   
So Black should concentrate on saving the two cutting stones that isolate the upper White group (Black 75-77 and Black 35 but not Black 63).]
;W[hl];B[hk]C[Black 81 only helps White. It should be tobi at H10.]
;W[il]C[ Now Black cannot easilly save both Black 35 and Black 75-77]
;B[hm]C[Black 83 helps White. It should be nobi at G9 or tobi at H11.]
;W[ii]C[With white 84, White take some pivot stones and has already won the game.        It's a big catastroph in the center.]
;B[ho]C[Black cannot kill this group so after the big catastroph in the center the game is already lost.
