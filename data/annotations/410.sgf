WR[25k]HA[0]KM[5.5];B[dp]C[Great Move!  ha ha

A few words on my commentary that follows:

I hope it will be construed as coming from me with good humor, as well as 
humility.

Having skimmed the game once already, I think I have some positive advice 
to give.  However, sometimes I may suggest a move is bad, and will try to 
offer a better move, knowing that my idea is likely not the BEST 
alternative (I am after all only IGS 10k*).

As the players of this game are listed at 25k I am assuming each is 
fairly new to the game, and will try to comment very thoroughly.

Certainly, none of the comments I make here should be taken as personal 
attacks on either player!

This review is being constructed using SmartGo v4.1 on a Macintosh 
personal computer.

This review comes at the request of dsmith, the black player in this 
game.];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[dj]C[There is nothing wrong with black at D10. 
 However, you might try playing K4 instead of D10.   At least until you 
gain more experience at Go.

The "sanren-sei" formation of K4 is very popular and therefore would 
offer you lots of good practice, as well as outside study sources (if 
you want to study) such as pro game examples and books ("The Power of 
the Star Point" by Takagawa is good for this).  It might be a good way 
to quickly play out your first 3 moves (the hardest ones sometimes), so 
you can focus on the strategic implications of the opening and how to 
foil white's plans...

One of the benefits of the sanren-sei is that the three stones would be 
working together, and strengthen each other.  For example, given black 
d10 at K4 instead, white would have difficulty invading at the bottom as 
this would likely cause white to get small gains there and black to get 
big gains.];W[qj]C[I would prefer white to use the 'opportunity' left by 
black D10 to separate black's left and right at the bottom.

I would try K4 probably, figuring black follows at h3 or m-n3, then play 
white f3 or o3 (opposite black's approach).  This could give white a 
quick development on the bottom, so white might then make his own 
sanren-sei at the top with k16.

Also, I would at least play white on the fourth line at R6, thinking that 
now if black gets K4 and white gets K16, black would love to cap R10 by 
playing P10 perhaps - this could lead to a large black framework at the 
bottom.];B[jj]C[I think k4 would be better first.

Generaly, opening theory suggests:  Corners first, then sides, then 
middle.  In this game, K10 is not perhaps as 'important' as it would be 
if black first had K4 and white played K16.

K10 might seem to make a huge bottom moyo (potential area) for black, 
BUT since white can easily k4 now, black k10 I think is not yet important.

It is possible to play K10 early (even first) if you know how to use it 
while you are playing elsewhere.  I confess that I would probably not 
know how to do so effectively, but I think there are several times 
(later) in this game where black could have 'used' the stone at K10 to 
help corner fights and did not do so.];W[qn]C[Here white is missing the 
important points I think also.  If black plays o4 now, that would help 
make the bottom stronger for black and add value to k10.

Therefore white should consider 'undercutting' black's bottom half at k4 
first.

Granted, white r10 helps r6, so white can next play anywhere after o4 
(probably around f3 or maybe m3 threatening to dig under a black o4.  On 
the other hand, white has to worry about black playing r8 in the near 
future, and so R6 is not in my opinion a great move here.];B[qo]C[I 
>hate< this move.  I mean that in the best possible way!  I used to play this 
way too, but...

Players from 30k - 15k love to play the r5 attach to the r6 approach, but 
this is almost NEVER good.  If you take anything from this commentary, 
let it be this:  NEVER play r5 UNLESS you already have a black stone at 
Q10 or R10.  Here's why in brief...

White next MUST Q6, but that is EXACTLY what white wants to do, since 
white has a stone waiting at R10 - the PERFECT distance from Q&R6.  
Meanwhile after Black plays at O4, white can still invade at R3 and 
usually live, or at worst get a ko.

By playing R5, you are giving white a dominant position on the entire 
right side of the board that will make it difficult for Black to do 
anything here.  This already almost gives away the game to white.

ALTERNATIVE:  if you must have a 'standard' response to the r6 approach, 
make it o4.  This does make it easy for white to live on the side (no 
easier than R5 attach in this game mind you), but it also makes it more 
simple for black to deal with the corner.

Also, try learning some pincers, for cases where white does not have a 
stone at r10, but neither does black.

Summary:  Do not play r5 here, but rather o4 or o3 or n3 or a pincer (r8 
would be interesting if scary - practice this position for later 
sanren-sei games).

Also note:  Do not play Q6 here unless you have a stone at K4 and maybe 
also at Q10.  Following it is another joseki popular and misused by low 
kyu players.  Only do this in 6-9 stone handicap games.  Forget it 
elsewhere for now.

For all the apparent 'yelling' I use here, it is ok to make this mistake 
- everybody does.  But if you get r5 out of your games, your rank will 
improve assuredly.];W[pn]C[Bask in the glory of white's great formation on the right side! 
ha ha

Black should now o4 to keep alive the moyo possiblities of the bottom.  
But might it be better now, if black's stone at K10 were at K4?  Then 
black could try O3 now, making a white R3 invasion tougher.];B[no]C[This 
is an agressive idea, and your thinking, I believe, is to use your D4, 
D10, K10 stones to make a HUGE bottom moyo.  But I believe the reality 
does not match the plan here.

O5 does nothing to protect the bottom right corner. O5 does not threaten 
white on the side.  O5 does not impede a white invasion at the bottom.  
In fact, o5 makes a white invasion easier around K4 than black O4 might 
have.  

So O5 is not a good move here I think.  O5 might be good if Black needed 
outside influence in the game, but I think that Black has nothing BUT 
influence right now, and needs a move that is balanced more towards 
making actual territory.

Note:  Every corner is occupied by star point stones.  Therefore NONE of 
these corners = territory yet, not even the bottom right corner. If white 
can make a successful invasion on the bottom middle, threatening the 
bottom right, it is possible that white will also be able to play C3 and 
invade the bottom left leaving virtually NO black territory there.

If you view the bottom as Black territory now, you must learn that it is 
not.];W[fq]C[I would rather play white around K4, threatening both F3 and 
O3. But white is correct that playing an invasion is important before 
black reinforces  at k4.

F3 might be playing into black's hands if black responds correctly.  I 
think black's correct response would be a pincer move, probably at J4.

If black pincers here, then suddenly, black's previous O5 and K10 become 
stronger.  Black's efforts to attack F3 would act to strengthen the ties 
to the lower right - double purpose that is good for Black!

Imagine black j4, white d2, black c3, white g4, black maybe at h3 - this 
way black would be forming territory on both sides while attacking white 
- a key method for winning this game.

The worst thing black could do now is make it easy for white to live at 
the bottom with D6 or E3...];B[eq]C[Ouch!

I went over this kind of move at length at the R5 move, and so will not 
belabor the point again.

White now plays F4, and if black at D6, white gets a perfect bottom 
living group at K3 in the middle of black's (lost) potential.

Black might try to change that sequence to White F4, Black J-K4,forcing 
White to run for life?];W[fp];B[en]C[Again, I think this is too greedy.  
If you have a joseki book to study, you will probably not find E5 as a 
followup here, but rather C6 or D6.  Why is that?

White can still invade at C3 for one thing.

Maybe white c3, black d2, white d3, black c4, white e2, black c2, white 
captures at e4, black b3...];W[iq]C[This is bad.

White is probably 'scared' to be playing in the middle of black's big 
area, but there is nothing to be afraid of.  White should maximize 
potential living space and reduce black at the same time (double purpose 
= good for white).

So white should probably K3 or k4 now.  Black is almost forced to respond 
around m4 then, and white will live easily.];B[lq]C[If Black O5 were at 
O4, then it would be easier to play this move at L3.

I think I would still black L3...

On the other hand, perhaps now it is time to throw in the towel on the 
bottom side - white can still invade r3 remember.   Meanwhile, white is 
threatening to play K16 which would work very well with white's strong 
right side and with d16.  Perhaps black should beat white to the punch 
withe o17, f17 or k16?];W[jd]C[Great.

This is good by white, as white's survival at bottom is almost assured.

Look at board now with fresh impartial eyes.  Who has the best position?

Black has two areas of potential that seem fairly large sized, but can be 
invaded by white, and therefore are smaller than they appear.

White has a very small, but essentially living group at the bottom that 
has served it's purpose (to reduce black's bottom). White has a strong 
right side of board for making territory, and a strong top of board for 
attacking.

White has essentially already won this game (This may seem hard to 
believe at only 18 moves, but I feel that strategically white has the 
upper hand).  Of course, we kyu players often change destiny with simple 
mistakes!  It will take tactical strength to beat white now, by 
'neutralizing' white's lead with local fighting wins.  At the 25k level 
this is very possible.  At 10k and stronger, it would now be time for 
black to think about resigning (IMHO).  Isn't Go fun?];B[cc]C[This is 
only a good invasion if white's wall (that is about to form) does not 
have territory making potential.  In this case, this invasion should help 
white to lock up a huge top side territory.  Therefore C17 is bad.

I would consider playing C14 first, then if white F16, play at P10.

A black P10 might be a good way to reduce white's potential on the side.  
If black could do so and get the first move elsewhere, an invasion at r17 
might be good.  Or perhaps black could use the fight around p10 to push 
his way strongly into the top and top right from the outside.];W[dc]C[Correct response by white - potential is huge at top and small on 
left.];B[db]C[Black can play C16 first, then white D15, black D18, 
etc...];W[eb];B[ca]C[Yikes!

What was this for?  If black plays C18, then white must E17 (or F17) to 
stop black E17.

After that, black can play B15 to live.];W[bd]C[I think white better just 
playing C16 here, then black B17, white B16, black must B18 to live very 
small.];B[bc]C[Black might try C16 first, making cutting points to attack 
at B15 and D15.  Might enable a rescue of black's corner, which is in 
danger.];W[cd];B[cg]C[I would black at E17 here maybe, or B18 to live in 
corner.

If black E17 then what? - ladder works for black (not white) since 
black K10 (if you are going to play K10 instead of K4 - use it!) 
block's the ladder. (Ladder - black e17, white f17, black e16, white 
e15, black f16, white g16...).  So white could not play ladder out.

So maybe if Black E17, white F17
black E16, white F16, black E15,
white F18- then black at b18 to live in corner.  Following this, if black 
can keep his e17-e15 stones alive, he might capture white stones at c16 
group?];W[bb]C[ouch - black dead];B[cb]C[At least play this at A18 so 
that there can be some ko threats here.

C18 just adds to the headcount in this corner after B18 and does nothing 
to help the situation.];W[qc]C[This is big by white.

Essentially, white has figured out that the game is won, and is declaring 
that win with the move.

Black needs a miracle now.

White makes an invasion at R17 impossible, and makes it difficult for 
Black to sucessfully invade on the right side or the top side.];B[ab]C[Ko threat only.  Playing this outright in this manner only gives 
white 1 extra point for no benefit.];W[ba];B[aa]C[It would be good time 
to pick up a Life and Death book or a "Problems" book for studying 
positions like this.

This move only makes white 'richer' with no benefit to 
black.];W[kp]C[White decides to make bottom group absolutely alive and 
reduce black for sure.  This is only making white win secure in a 
conservative way now.

White could consider playing at P10 for huge win.];B[kn]C[I think this 
move does not do enough to threaten white's group.

I would prefer J5, which threatens to chop off a stone or two by cutting 
across K4-L3 or J4-K3.

Or perhaps black may play around g6 to try to gain some big area on left. 
 (This may be unlikely, since white can C3 and also white can reduce 
around E13)];W[lp];B[mp];W[ln];B[lo];W[mn];B[mo];W[ko];B[km];W[kq];B[mr]
;W[nn];B[on];W[om];B[oo];W[nm]C[Note how white's early strength at Q6 has helped him here.  Now 
white is threatening a big territory on right side];B[hn]C[Strategically 
this game has been over for some time (I think white R17 finalized 
this).

I will try to restrict commentary to tactical isseues, as well as discuss 
what moves still have value (although game winning value for black does 
not remain on board unless big white mistake I think).

White now wants to make invasion into C3 or at least play F2 to secure 
bottom group.  Black could play E2 first to make bottom left into big 
territory.

Similarly black could play S5 to make rather large bottom right before 
white invades (or uses sente to secure right side).

E13 is also big for both sides.  N-P10 is big for both.  

Black should try miracle invasion at top on 17th line, leveraging E17 cut 
to make living group there and maybe to reduce white 
base.];W[fn];B[fm];W[eo];B[dn];W[do];B[co];W[cp];B[cq];W[bp];B[bq];W[dr]
;B[ep]C[this is bad black move.  It only reduces 
black's liberties, and helps white to play F5, which white would like to 
do anyway.];W[fo];B[bo];W[er]C[this only works because of black liberty 
reducing move at E4 - do you see why that was bad?];B[ap];W[gm];B[fl];W
[hm];B[jl];W[hk];B[hj];W[gk];B[fk];W[gj];B[gi];W[fj];B[fi];W[ik];B[jk];W
[ij];B[ii];W[ej];B[ek]C[this move would be better at c9.  
E9 just makes a shape that is famous because it leaves black in a 
position with limited liberties, which makes it easier to threaten or 
kill.

This famous shape is called an empty triangle, and is the shape formed by 
E9, F9, and F8.  In this case it's not quite a triangle because of F7, 
but since F7 is bordered by white at f6 and g7, the liberties of the 
whole group are limited just like a 'pure' empty triangle.  The problem 
is that the liberty at E8 is 'shared' and therefore sort of counts as two 
liberties to reduce when white plays there. 

Eventually in this game, the liberty at G8 will be filled.  Then after 
that white at D9 might be a double threat since white can follow D9 with 
atari at D11 or at E7.

If Black plays at D9 here instead of E9, he is 'backing away' from the 
local fight a bit, but eliminating white future threats which will push 
him back anyway.];W[ei];B[eh];W[di];B[ci];W[dk]C[White gets to capitalize on the bad shape of E9 
already...];B[cj];W[em];B[el]C[better perhaps at D8];W[dm]C[good move by 
white - none of this is possible if black e9 were at 
d9...];B[cm];W[dl];B[ck];W[cn];B[cl];W[bn];B[bm]C[Clearly there have been big losses in this fight for black.

I think these losses for the most part come from the most dangerous of go 
playing traits - greed.  Probably every player under 4d who loses games 
loses do to bad decisions made because they are unwilling to concede 
enough (if you always concede only 49% of the board - then you always 
win :).

This is why players make moves like R5 (remember my rant at the 
beginning of the game? :).  R5 on the surface looks good because it 
SEEMS to push white around and SEEMS to grab a big corner territory.  In 
fact, R5 pushed white around - into making a perfect move, and also 
grabbed a big corner territory that was highly fragile.

Being able to see under the surface comes only with experience.  It will 
not be long till you can read out a fight a few moves ahead and realize 
that say the E9 group is about to be captured.  So then, you say, I must 
back down a bit in order to save that important group. 

 (How about the bottom left corner group - is it in danger yet?  What if 
white plays C4, then black B4 then white D3?  Suddenly black will have no 
eyes! = dead)

In the meantime, you might remember this while fighting:  It is often 
stronger not to attach when attacking.  Conversely, attaching usually 
strengthens weak stones.  As an example now, it would probably be better 
to attack the R10 stone by playing at P10 than to attack it by playing 
Q10.

Also if you want to get stronger, contact Kiseido Publishing and purchase 
these books:  "Tesuji" by James Davies, "Get Strong at Tesuji" by 
Bozulich, and "Life and Death" by Davies.  These are the fundamental 
books in english on how to fight and win local 
fights.];W[an];B[ao];W[cp];B[bp];W[bs];B[br];W[cs];B[ar];W[dh]C[White had left you the opportunity to live in bottom right.  Did 
you see this move? (d3 is the way to save the bottom left 
now)];B[dg];W[hi];B[hh];W[fh];B[gh];W[eg]C[These kind of moves are 
always exasperating  for players in black's position.  You just can't 
figure out how to stop white from breaking through!

Well to stop this in the future, back off while you fight.  Fence your 
opponent in from a short distance, keeping your attacking stones 
connected to each other by 1-2 space jumps and "knights moves."

Remember:  It takes 4 stones to capture 1 stone.  The lesson here is, it 
is easier to defend than attack.

So make 'fences' of one space jumps and knights moves that you can defend 
when white is forced to break through.  Black's entire 'fence' around 
white's bottom-middle group in this game has been attached directly to 
white and therefore has led to white's methodically pushing through, 
eating many black stones along the way.

Every black move since black 53 has been attached to a white stone!  
That's over half the moves in the game!];B[fg]C[this is not a threat to 
white.  Since white is alive at the bottom, white does not care if F12 
gets captured.  That is only 1 point lost.  Better for black to attack 
elsewhere and more 'loosely.'];W[ef];B[ch];W[in]C[Good move, although not truly big enough yet.

If Black plays at J6, then white might get separated by black at G6.  
However, White will probably live at bottom and top, so separation is not 
that urgent.

White might play at j12 cut now, or maybe grab more topside territory 
with defensive moves at F16 or N16 
etc...];B[eh];W[ff];B[ig];W[jh];B[ki];W[jg];B[kr];W[jr];B[ji];W[jf];B[if]

C[Ok,  I assume that black resigned 
here, or soon hereafter.  Let's review what went wrong for black:

Strategy:  I think black's ideas in the early game were ok, but too 
aggressive.  Then black gave up on the strategic needs of this game and 
got bogged down in the fighting.  Why did black never invade at the top 
or right?  Every couple moves remind yourself to look at the whole board 
and decide if you can leave your fight for bigger spoils elsewhere.
  White had a better strategic sense, or at least a fairly consistent 
application of such.  It is a measure of strength that White left local 
fights to play at K16 and at R17 - Bigger strategic points.

I too have played games like this, where I've given away a giant part of 
the board because I was afraid that I could not invade and live in that 
part.  But you can't win like this.  If a part of the board is THAT big - 
you must learn to see it early on, and get there first!  If you don't, 
you still have to make the attempt or the game will be lost anyway.

Go back to move # 20 and guess who will win.  Hopefully, I think you can 
see the answer!

Tactics:  The fighting in the lower side of the board that spilled upward 
were clearly damaging for black, and probably in the game are what 
convinced black that the game was lost.  The only way to improve at 
fighting like this is to play lots of games, and study 'problems' books 
like "Tesuji," "Get Strong At Tesuji," or "Graded Go Problems for 
Beginners."

Try to reduce the impulse to attack by attaching.  "Attack from a 
distance!"

The fighting in the top left corner showed a lack of life and death 
understanding by black.  I would recommend the book "Life and Death" by 
James Davies for improvement here.

Play 9x9 games with other kyu players (within 4 stones strength of you) 
to gain some tactical strength without the 'hassle' and time of playing 
the big board strategy games.  These games are fast and fun and you focus 
all your strength on fighting skills and life and death - exactly what 
you need until your are 15k or stronger.

Overall, I get the sense that Black was thinking about strategic 
objectives and that with some improvement that comes naturally from 
playing will improve in rank for sure.

While it is not necessary to study books to improve at Go, I think the 
books I've mentioned in this commentary are for the most part very 
valuable at accelerating improvement, and are fun to read - they all 
provide problems and are not just 'tiresome' theory books.

I believe books on tesuji (fighting skills) and life and death helped 
my game the most from 25k - 15k.  While you might get some benefit from 
books on the opening or about joseki, these books become more valuable 
after 15k.  The difference between weak kyu players is almost always 
tactical in nature.

Good luck.  Hope some of the commentary is helpful!])
