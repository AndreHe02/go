C[Dear reviewer,

I am bat (3k on KGS) playing white. This is the first time that I have a game of mine reviewed. And its also the first time that I looked at one of my games very closely.

I found a few mistakes that I did. With out them the game would have been really close I think. So this was already a learning experience for me.

I would be happy if you could point out things that I have not been able to see or aspects I didn't think of.

semelis: You found out most of the big mistakes. I hope that my analysis is of some help.
Very interesting the way you changed  strategy and come back into the game.

Thank you very much in advance and kind regards,

[cl:C][gd:D]TR[dn]C[I think up to here it looks quite equal even though the position at the top is a little thin.

semelis: more or less I agree. Instead of the triangled stone at D6 I think that the low extension at A is better, specialy if you plan to play at the top next.

Now, instead of the squared stone at E15, something around B on the left side seems better, as C is a very good point for black, 
If you are really worried about the upper side thinness, D seems the move.

I'm not sure if the way I continued was good...

semelis: I don't think it was good. See the variation I propose.]

(;W[df]LB[ef:A]C[semelis: this seems too much. It's a bit of a contradiction thinking that white is thin, -so weak, specially if this is the area where white's points are more likely to appear- and then initiating a fight here. 
Just  extending at A is better.];B[ef];W[dd];B[ce];W[fe];B[dc]
LB[eb:A]C[semelis: just compare this position, with a white answer at A, with the previous variation.]
;W[dg];B[ed];W[fd];B[eb];W[fc];B[ch];W[dh];B[di];W[fg];B[cl]
LB[eb:A][fb:B][di:C][cl:D]C[Now the top is not so thin anymore but black made a lot of points on the left side.

semelis: compare again with the given variation: at the top, A would be a white stone, not a black one, this makes an enormous difference in the corner, and white can still play at B in sente as it threatens to destroy a lot of points. White has lost about 6 points here and at the same time black has protected almost 10 points in the corner. Another plus for black  is the stone at C, that helps in linking the attack at D with making points in the left side.

The only plus for white has been capturing 1 stone. Although this means that white's position is certainly stronger than in the variation proposed, in that variation D was not so interesting because of the lack of the C reinforcement, so I think black gain in the upper left corner has almost been for free.]
;W[go];B[gp];W[dl];B[cm];W[cn];B[dm]LB[dr:A]C[semelis: I'm not sure about this push, immediattely at A seems better.]
;W[em];B[dr]C[semelis: black seems a bit too greedy here, maybe thinking that white will answer at 3-3. But having lost a liberty should have been prepared something for a white counter attack.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[el];B[bk];W[cj]
(;B[dj]LB[bj:A]C[semelis: too greedy, black must play at A, see variation.]
;W[bj]
(;B[bl];W[bn]LB[dj:A]C[I should have played W A 9 and capture the black stones. I didn't see it :(
Was this the losing move?

semelis: more than 20 points and the difference of a weak bunch of stones and a settled group ... is really enormous.  The bad move at A that allowed white to recover from the initial loss at the top now turns to work.]
;B[bi];W[pg];B[kf]LB[fb:A][gf:B][hc:C]C[semelis: before reducing like this black has to push at A, if white blocks, B is a good kikashi, if white answers A at  C, B is a bit too risky, but there's no need to make a deep move from the center as the upper side is already getting smaller.]
;W[qg]LB[kh:A][om:B][qm:C]TR[nq]C[semelis: interesting. I think is no good, but it might work in upsetting the game. I would cap at A instead.
The problem here is that black can play at B now, not only reducing the right side potential almost in sente as it has a follow up at C, but also increasing blacks lower side and removing the aji of the marked stone.]
;B[pf];W[of];B[kd]LB[kh:A][og:B]C[semelis: black is ahead, no need to take big risks, just A seems safer,  and it threatens the cut at B too. Even cutting at B now seems possible.]
;W[pn]LB[qg:A]C[semelis: on the other hand white is behind, taking risks is necessary, and the 2 black stones at the top are still weak, ignoring them to build like this is very interesting.
And it removes the main cause against the block A.];B[np];W[kh]
C[semelis: good, white plan is working.];B[je];W[id];B[ie];W[le]
LB[kc:A][og:B]C[semelis: I don't like this kikashi, even if black just connects, white would lose the connection at the upper side with A, and with a cut at B still possible, is a bit risky.  To kill all this black stones doesn't seem possible.]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[kc];W[he]LB[fb:A]C[W J 17 probably better?

semelis: or K18, I prefer K18, but it's not so solid as J17.
seeing how this has evolved, black was right to keep the push at A in reserve. now there're more possibilities here.]
;B[ic];W[gd];B[jc]
(;W[hb]C[W M13 probably better. Sealing black in and threatening to make a big moyo on the right side.

semelis: Yes, no doubt about it. The seal is not perfect, but black stones are not alive neither. There's still a chance they die.
I prefer N 13 though, see varitions. No one looks too good, but black must take some risks too.]

C[semelis: The hane and connection at A is sente, as it threatens to steal most of white points, C2 is obviously big, but not really sente.]
;W[mp]LB[on:A]C[semelis: why?, usually better the atari from the outside at A]
;B[no];W[rf];B[re];W[qe];B[pe];W[oe];B[qe];W[cf]LB[se:A]C[semelis: bad, white loses one important liberty. At the right side,  there's still 1 more atari to be played before deciding whether to protect or play elsewhere.]
;B[bf];W[os];B[ns];W[ps];B[nr];W[qo]C[semelis: small and gote, the lower left corner is bigger and more important.]
;B[bq];W[bp];B[dq];W[cp];B[fo];W[gk]C[This seems to be a mistake. W should have connected at E 6 because cut at H 9 is not possible.]

C[semelis: if the A stone is not necessary to make 2 eyes or to get sente, this echange is bad, as now the 3 white stones only have 1 liberty and most of the aji remaining here is gone.]
;W[br];B[bs];W[aq]LB[ar:A]C[semelis: usually better to extend at A, as now black can play at A and get a ko to take out 1 eye.]

[bf:B]C[A big mistake by black.

semelis: yes !!!  more than 10 points ... That was a possible side effect of the marked echange I criticized earlier.]

;W[ld]C[Here I didn't see the possibility of making a ko at A 2. That cost a lot of points. Should have played A 2 of course. Even earlier.

semelis: yes, as earlier as instead of A3.];B[lb];W[mb];B[kb]
;W[lf];B[kg];W[mg];B[am]C[semelis: bad,  now white still can play at A2 and be alive.]
;W[se];B[sc];W[rg];B[ar];W[as];B[gf];W[gb];B[ar];W[hd]LB[fk:A]
[lk:B][db:C][cb:D][mq:E]C[This is whites biggest threat I think. Black should have answered at L 16. Black has plenty of threats.

semelis: the threat is worth about 20 points, the ko about 30 or 35 . Black has only 2 more big threats at F9 and M9 -A and B- but B is not so big.  
White still has another threat at C, taking the upper left corner with D next is worth (black loses about 12 points, white gains another 10, more or less)  22 points, as big as the cut at the upper side. 
The 3rd threat at E is doubtful, even if answered during the game. If it is actually a threat, is bigger than anything else.

I think it's ok for black to move on the 2 step ko here, as it's almost impossible to lose it.]
;B[bq];W[mq]C[semelis: good bluff :), but not a threat, see variation.]

(;B[lp];W[br];B[co]C[semelis: not so big threat, white has a chance, see variation]

(;W[bo];B[bq];W[dd]LB[db:A]C[semelis: the threat at A is better than taking the ko I think, as this only threatens to set up another ko and white has no ko threats to fight it.]
;B[ap];W[cc];B[db];W[bc];B[ed];W[ke];B[dd]C[semelis: so finally it ends as if white had cut to begin with and black had taken the corner, only that white used 2 big ko threats for nothing, actually, losing  about 2 points in tue upper left.]

At the top, C becomes a weak point, specially after A, so white maybe can not block so forcefully at the top, increasing the loss from the earlier mistake.]
