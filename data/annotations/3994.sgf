C[Reviewer: Thank you for taking the time to look at my game. I am playing white here.

M: Hi, I hope this review is helpful, it is my first one so please e-mail me with any ideas on how I could have done it better. Thanks]

(;B[pn]C[M: This move by black is a little slow.]
(;W[kp]C[M: this lets black take the corner in sente with R3]

(;B[pj];W[jc];B[fq];W[hq]C[rasa: Should this have been around c10? I have a tendancy to defend more then I attack.

M: yes. There is no doubt about it C10 is the move.];B[cj];W[ce]
;B[cd];W[de];B[fc];W[ch];B[cm];W[pf]C[M: You should play e12 here. C7 (which should have been at D7 or even E10 if black is confident about his loose corner) provides backup to attack your weak stones at  c12. With an attack on those stones black can build up the power to invade N17 area. Consider black B13 (shpwn later) to start you floating without a base.

 That said if you are going to play on the right side considering the high position of blacks group there R13 would prob. be better.]
;B[lc];W[nc];B[hc]C[M: This is bad by black. O17 prevented Q18 but white does not have a good extension to the left.]
;W[je];B[he];W[ho]C[rasa: Instead of h5, could I have captured Bm17 by playing WL14 or something similar?

M: Black H15 is a strong move starting a splitting attack against K17 and C15. You CANNOT tenuki. C15 is weak considering black has B13 (see variations) as a way to start trouble. I think you have to play E12 here.

   wm15 is the move.]
(;B[le];W[kd]C[M: If you are trying to stop black linking up underneath I would suggest playing M18 yourself.]
;B[ld];W[if];B[id];W[jd];B[mg];W[hg]
(;B[jg];W[fh]C[rasa: I'm not to happy about my feeling compeled to run and connect (Wj14, h13, f12) to the left side group. Another of my tendacies is to run instead of trying to use them to counter-attack. Could I have done something else here?

M: You set yourself up for a bad result at the top when you played H5. You tenukied and left C12 weak then tenukied again at the vital moment. Considering that the result you got here was good as you got to get in the key move F12 and strengthened the C12 stones. But black could have played better.]
;B[fo]C[M:  Black should be happy for the f5-h5 exchange. He gains more terrritory and strengthens his loose corner in the process.]

(;W[mn]C[M: I would try P11 instead as it  is a strong leaning attack against the M17 group. R8 is also playable.]

(;B[nn];W[mo]
(;B[jf];W[ie];B[ig];W[hf];B[fj]C[M: this move is big, the possible attack on M16 is weakened.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[pi];B[oi];W[oh];B[nh]
(;W[ri];B[rj];W[ml];B[jj]
(;W[jl];B[hm];W[in];B[pc]C[rasa: As you'll see I handled this pretty badly. How should I played this? Though I was able to cut off Bm16 group, I believe I got the short end of the deal. Correct?

M: O18 allows R16 so should be out of the question, the 2 moves to consider are R17 and Q18. Black should be able to get a few points off you here so seeing as you managed to cut off M16 group you didn't come out too badly.]

[es][fs][gs]C[rasa: Thanks again for taking the time to review my game.

White: 80 territories + 11 prisoners + 6.5 komi = 97.5
Black: 87 territories + 13 prisoners = 100
Result: B+2.5

M: Thanks for showing me this game. The key point of the game was the H5 mistake and I think you should have cut and fought on the right later on. You managed to fight back well though towards the end of the game and you were controlling the board, it's unfortunate it just wasn't enough.]
