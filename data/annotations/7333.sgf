AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi !

This was a very slow game with a much better player. Unfortunately, my victory was sealed by a move we both missed until late yose...
Anyway, this is a game where I played very seriously, so I guess my mistakes here must root pretty deep in my way of play.

I am a French native-speaker, but English or German would do it as well : please choose your favourite one :o) .

Best regards,
mianreg

Hello, 

First of all i am sorry, it took so long. Because i am working hard these months at construction site. And as an engineer i must check everything...
I should say this was a good game. You and white player played very well. So lets begin..]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[pj]C[By the way, in handicap games, this Kobayashi-like jump is my favourite one with W... because I'm not sure how to answer... If you know a common reaction that would best fit, please let me know ! :o)]
;B[qm];W[fc];B[jc];W[df];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[ec];B[de];W[ge]
C[At handicap games if you are B you should make agressive Defend. Because you have something at beginning. Defend-atack play is the best way for Handicap games. I am sure you know this. W should try to live and try to make some points. Let him make some. So as a little move D17 defending to corner and makes you group alive. But if i was the B i prefered the D17. Why? because its more creative :). Joking :).]

(;B[dc];W[je]C[After your passive defence W pushed your area and tried to make more points.]
;B[hc]C[Good one];W[gc];B[ld]C[Now you have nearly flawless defense at upper side (except R17 san-san)]
;W[ff];B[cf];W[cg]
(;B[dg];W[ef];B[dh];W[ce];B[bf];W[bg];B[be];W[ci];B[gf];W[kc]
;B[kd];W[fh];B[hf];W[id];B[ic];W[ig];B[gh];W[di];B[fg]C[I started this sequence to force W make a dumpling... The point is, it is a very bad call, for he connects the whole thing...

Yes your whole groups are seperated there. This is very pointless close combat for B.]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[gg]
(;B[ee];W[fg];B[hg];W[fi];B[ih];W[jg];B[gi];W[ei];B[gk];W[jh]
;B[ii];W[cn];B[kj]TR[gf][hf][hg][gh][ih][gi][ii][gk]C[Widening my central group and pressuring W's weak one, I like it better than just answering the kakari.

But with all triangle moves helped the whites connection, made him solid. As a B player if you are trying to live somewhere, you can sure you are losing something. Because W player is better than you (mostly :) )]
;W[mh]C[Like this one, he is trusting his group now. So he will play agressive now.]
;B[fp];W[bp]C[Joseki];B[co];W[bo];B[dn];W[cq];B[cm]C[Uhh, i can understand the move. But isn't it too small? J3 or K3 is better than this one.]
;W[hp];B[jq]C[Not sure of this one, but I guess it's an annoying one. B6 is clean but I thought it was still irrelevant.]
;W[io];B[mq];W[fm];B[dq];W[bn];B[dl];W[fk];B[gn];W[im];B[hm]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[ik];B[gm];W[kp];B[jp];W[jo];B[kq];W[lp]C[K4 very ajikeshi, right ?..]
;B[kn];W[mo]C[If i was the B, i play L5 here. Why? Because that makes game abit difficiult for me and my opponent. After combat he can lost 1 of his groups..]
;B[lq];W[lm];B[jl];W[il];B[jj]C[I considered Q3 as well, but to me, the sequence with K10 seems enormous at this point, and of course much more active.

I agree with you here.];W[qp];B[qo];W[pq];B[op];W[rq];B[rp]
;W[qq];B[pn];W[mj];B[rd]C[my upper side is still pretty loose with this move... It seems clean, but as I thought, the invasion was a success, and I would be very grateful to get advice about the next few moves...

I prefer R16 or (maybe) R17 here. I will explain why after several move.]
;W[mc];B[lc];W[qc]SQ[kc][mc]C[This is the explanation of Why question. W is using square ones aji.]
