C[Hi,

My name is Sam Aitken. I live in the UK and am a BGA 4d. I play on KGS as hotspur and aitkensam so if you have any questions about the review feel free to contact me there.]

@ komoku in this direction is it correct ?

You may be correct here but it is not something for us to worry about. Maybe this will affect pros but certainly not amateurs :-)
It does make more logical sense to play the other way to me though.]

[fp:C][cq:E][fq:A]C[It is awkward for white here. But that doesn't mean bad. I would not be at all surprised to see a pro just dive in to the corner as they can cope quite well with moyo's. 

If you are worried about the global position maybe it is better to play C6 as a wedge at C10. This way no moyo can be formed.

I would not be a fan of B here. A seems ok.
My other thoughts are these C, D, E. D is a bit extreme and almost certainly not optimal in a pro game. However, if you have a problem with moyo's it is a sure way to limit them at little cost.]

This does leave the potential to grow the moyo. I wouldnt call it bad, but if you are scared of moyo maybe its not optimal.]

This move is a bit too "obvious" to me. It only has one purpose which is to reduce the moyo. It is better to try to be more active in your reduction as shown in var.]

A close game. I think you played well just a couple of errors on judgement of developable territories (eg. right side was small and yet spent a lot of moves being developed) and unfortunately the reduction technique was not quite enough to shrink blacks territory enough.

The key points in my opinion.

D3 - A bad direction, white leads.

J3 - Too close to the thickness. This gave black a way back in to the game. This made F3 a heavy stone when you shouldn't really want to save it. This group was a burden on you for the rest of the game. Simply K4 at the bottom will simplify the game and white should be happy.

C17 - Good timing. It's essential that you got this in sente. This makes the cash in w's favour. The next challenge is to deal with the moyo.

J9 - The game is close at this point. If w finds a better/more active way to reduce he can probably win. Moves like peeping at R7 can help to achieve this. Simply jumping in is too one dimensional.

G12 - After this the game is close. Maybe slightly in blacks favour. A good yose may have won it for you but you must try to take the initiative and not respond to all opponents moves. O18 and C8 in the yose clinched the game for black.]
