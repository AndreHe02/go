;B[pc]C[Hi, my name is Charles and I played white in this game.  It seemed to be a free for all with many individual groups.  I will appreciate any review.


R: Hi, I hope this review will help you
For any questions you can find me on KGS or IGS as Wiles];W[pp]
;B[cp];W[cc]C[My current style is the 4-4 and 3-3 opening.  This was the only time I've done it split against 3-4, 3-4 black.  It seemed to give me a good opening, but I may be looking at it wrong.

R: I searched this patter between nearly 2000 pro games, and it was never played, i think because C4 isn't good as it give W two nice kakari at e3 and r15]
;B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[qq];B[kp];W[qe]C[Seemed logical

R: This is a big point but you may also consider an invasion in the bottom left.]
;B[dj]C[R: Now the B is building a nice framework W shouldn't wait too long before invading]
;W[df]MA[jd][nd][ep]C[I was thinking if black played E-4 then I would play K-16 or O-16.  Black has larger framework so i was planning invading after these moves.

R: This is too slow, all the marked point are better.
Black is building a nice framework so you must think about an invasion, or a move on the top left to take advantage of the B tenuki

The 3-3 point is easy to settle, so there is no hurry to play D14]
;B[oe];W[qc];B[qb];W[pd];B[oc];W[od];B[nd]
(;W[pe]C[R: Too mild, a cut at o15 may be better (see var), the exchange q19 n17 is bad for W since B fixes his shape]
;B[mc];W[of]TR[qn]C[R: Building a wall here isn't interesting since the marked stone is low
And your group need no reinforcement since S17 and an extension on the side are miai, so this was the right time for an invasion in the bottom left

A Black move at e4 will give him a very good position];B[pj]
;W[ne]C[Felt like the strongest move both from proverb and appearence.

R: Yes, W now is strong here, so he could take sente to invade in the bottom, since a B move in this zone doesn't affect him]
;B[qg];W[pg]MA[jd][ph][qk][ep]C[The marked spaces look better in hindsight.

R: Bad, this only help B.
When you want to attack a group you should stole his base, not give it one

 You can start an attack with R9.
 Naturally invading in the bottom is still a good move];B[qh]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[pl];B[qj];W[rk];B[ec]C[R: This move is strange, the B group on the right is weak, and now B will create another weak group here, so the game now seem an easy one for W if he can gain advantage of this]
;W[gc];B[cd];W[dd];B[dc];W[ce];B[bd];W[bc];B[fd]
(;W[jc]C[R: G16 was a stronger move, this is too submissive (see var)]
;B[gd];W[hd];B[he];W[id];B[gf];W[ci]C[R: Wrong direction, B now has 2 weak groups so you should attack them.
And letting B play both C10 and D11 is bad since this help his upper group and help him build a mojo in the bottom]
;B[di];W[ch];B[cj];W[eq];B[gq]
(;W[do]C[R: Usually this move is used to build thickness, but here it is useless since you are in a B's area of influence.
You should try to settle your group quickly
the common move here is C3 (see var)

B can also push and cut with d4 e5 giving W a very bad result]

(;B[co];W[dn];B[cm];W[cr]C[R: White is thin now];B[dq];W[dr]

(;B[rc]C[R: W is very lucky, B missed a chance here, letting W live easily in the bottom is a huge mistake
See var for a B follow up in the bottom];W[cq];B[dp];W[ep];B[cn]
;W[fn]C[R: All the B mojo is gone, now the game seem easy for W]

(;W[gp]C[Looks very slow in hindsight.

R: Yes, a move at N2 kills B so i think that was the only move now]
;B[lr];W[kr];B[ms];W[nr]C[R: you cant kill B now since q3 is sente for him]
;B[or];W[qs];B[pq];W[op]C[R: Bad, this move is only useful if you can kill B, but now it's better to defend at s3]
;B[rq];W[qp];B[sr];W[rp];B[rs];W[oq];B[ig]C[R: N2 is worth about 15 points, so I think B must defend there since there aren't bigger point on the board, and this move isn't sente, since he can't kill this group]
;W[bq]C[R: as before O1 was greater];B[kc];W[kb];B[ib];W[ia]

(;B[jb]C[R: B can try K19 here but it doesn't work (see var)]
;W[ja];B[mb];W[kd];B[lc];W[la];B[ap]C[R: a monkey jump is worth about 8 points, so N2 is still greater than this]
;W[sh];B[rh];W[si];B[sg];W[rj];B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[km]C[The next few moves I made to trade out the center.    The score looks even, but black seems to be giving up more points.]
