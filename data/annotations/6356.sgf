C[This game was against a 23k opponnent on the Oro Baduk server. I am 24k on this server. I felt I was playing well until the late-mid game when a large group got cut-off in the lower-middle area. I thought I was connecting well, but realized too late that I wasn't. I completely fell apart and resigned near the end-game after a terrible mistake on my part. Any tips would be appreciated! I felt I played the opening well.

igor> Hello, I am Igor and I will review your game. Please notice that my rating is not very high, so my comments do not mean the truth but the opinion of a 13k player.]

(;W[gq]C[igor > I would play F3 here];B[oq];W[dj]C[I felt I was playing wel up to this point. I planned to break up his right side with my next move.

igor > black is doing well.];B[dg];W[qe]LB[nd:B]C[I answer his approach with O17, per my readings in Learn to Play Go Vol.II.
 
igor > It is ok, but I would rather play at B as it has more influence on the top side]
;B[nc];W[lc]C[I felt I had enough room to live in the upper-right, so I went to make sure I had enough on the left. I think I should have played near the lower-middle or right-hand star points instead, or F16 or C17 in order to break up his area more.

igor> B is not so good, in my opinion. I would also consider R11 as the next B move.]
;B[ci];W[id]C[This leads to a massive upper territory on his part later on.]
;B[cj]LB[pj:B][qj:C]C[igor> black 19 is not urgent. I would rather take C or B]
;W[qj]C[He gets the right star-point. It would have been much different had I played here as I said earlier.]
;B[qh]C[Trying to break him up so he doesn't claim the whole right side.

;B[pk]C[igor> I dont't like b29, as it makes white stronger, helping to build base on the write side. Better would be to invade on the top side (around E17). Invasion at C17 will help white to build a wall with influence to the center, which is not good for black.]
;W[qk];B[cc]C[Invading, finally.];W[dc];B[cd]C[igor> now black gets a corner, giving up the top side. it is better for white.]
;W[rc]C[I was worried with his 34 play. I figured I'd have to fight well to stay alive. I did, but lose it all in the end due to a stupid blunder.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[qb]C[I felt I was okay in the upper-right at this point.

igor> I am not so sure. I would rather try to run to the center and to connect to P12 group. P15 or Q15.]

;W[ea];B[ca];W[da]C[igor> moves 119-123 were not necessary for black. It would be better to concentrate on the middle of the board to gain more influence. Up to now, white has a strong wall on d7 and has neutralized the black wall on p14. I would also try to reduce the white territory on the bottom.]
;B[ga]C[Here, while I couldn't see it, I felt sure I could kill the D17 group with this peep.]
;W[ha]C[Now, I wasn't so sure.];B[jc]C[Was going to try to cut in at J17 and try to kill still...but I was realizing quickly that it wasn't going to happen.

igor> white has two eyes, so it is impossible to kill the group. black 125 is a thank you move - white is glad to connect the groups.]
;W[jd];B[kc];W[kd]C[Now my J17 pair is cut-off.  From here, is there anyway to save them?

igor> I don't think so.]
(;B[ja]C[Still trying...it seemed right at the time.

igor> black has no chance to survive - not enough place to make two eyes. If you plan to surround the group n17, you must cut at M16 (but it wouldn't work also :)]

igor>  before you try the cuts that do not work, you should make another reasonable moves. For example, defining the boards of the top right group, bottom left group and so on. Such cuts may be useful for you if you have a ko fight.]

igor> Even if your group would live, white was leading about 50 points. The main problem was the middle group. You should secure the group much earlier.

Nevertheless, I was quite surprized with the game. I would estimate your rating much higher (or my rating lower :). 
In the end of the game you were tired and make some unreasonable moves.
It was an interesting game. The beginning was quite good, and your main mistake is that you play too thick. white built up more influence in the middle, playing lighter.

Best regards,
