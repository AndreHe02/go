more inclined to play a cap at 'a' to flatten white out.
White can take the corner
but then Black can take a big point in the bottom right.];W[ee];B[ef];W
[fe];B[cc]C[I don't know this move. Shouldn't black's move be at 'a'?];W
[dd];B[ce];W[ci]C[This invasion looks too early.  I think the big area is the bottom right.]
;B[ek];W[cg];B[cd]C[This is big for black. Now white cannot push and cut.]
;W[dj]C[I think this peep is wrong. Just running out to the middle seems good.]
;B[dk];W[fi];B[dg];W[ff];B[dh];W[eg];B[df];W[ej]C[Overall, I think the invasion has failed since black is now secure in
the corner and the bottom left and has sente. White's middle area looks
overcrowded and can be reduced.];B[np]C[Huge.];W[pf];B[qf]C[This exchange is good for black.]

white back in the game with the unecessary
loss of the lower left corner.];B[lq];W[ho]C[White was worried about the cut at 'a', I suppose, but this move
leaves a weakness at 'b' so why not play 'b' directly?];B[jl];W[jo]C[This move seems too small.]
;B[ln]C[I like 'a' better.];W[ij];B[kj];W[il]C[This move seems like an overplay.]
;B[ik];W[hk];B[jk];W[hl];B[hj];W[hm];B[in]C[White can capture the seven black stones with a cut at 'a'. That would
give White about 70 points in the bottom left. However, Black has at leas=
t 80 points on the right side and sente to reduce the top.]
