C[[ekberg\] Hi reviewer!
Thanks for reviewing this game, where I played black (ekberg).
I had a good feeling in the middle game, having a weak group to chase and building a large moyo. Only late in yose I found myself behind.
Some of the kibitzers (my first game with kibitz!) accused me of being too passive. I would appreciate you telling me how to play with more kiai. (I have deleted the chat however).
And could you recommend some books for getting stronger?
----------
Hi John, 
My name is Gus, and I'm 3-4k, so I'll do my best, but keep in mind that I too still have some to learn too. I've tried to provide copious variations/suggestions for both sides so you can understand both what you missed and what your oponent gave you for free. Some of the variations are quite long, and please keep in mind that they are intended as examples. I expect that they do not represent ideal play, but hopefully are helpful to you. Also this is my first review, so let me know if I can improve :).

Summary of the game:
1. Your 3rd move is a bit odd and took the opening off the beaten path, though it is not a huge problem.
2. Your opening development was a bit slow and perhaps overly territorial.
3. You really must study the chinese opening. In this game you had the oportunity to play it, and then were forced to invade the chinese formation when white made that shape. Your invasion was both too early and not the best invasion point.
4. W made a pretty big error that gave you complete control over the center. You were winning.
5. You gave away your upper right corner needlessly.
6. You missed about 20 oportunities to invade white's 4-4 corner, and put yourself ahead or keep the game even.

The difference in the game was the failure to invade, and the corner you gave away.

I think you need to carefully study the 3-3 invasion of the 1 point jump from the star point (page 148 of takemiya's book below). 

Books I have read or am reading and reccomend: 

1. Yilun Yang 7Dan: Fundamental Principals of Go
2. Toshiro Kageyama 7 Dan: Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go
3. Kato Masao 9 Dan: The Chinese opening (out of print, but check Amazon)
4. Masaki Takamiya 9 Dan: Enclosure Joseki (out of print, very hard to find except on CD as part of kiseido Bookshelf One)

Guo Juan's Audo Go lessons site has some lectures on the chinese opening, which can be used instead of or as follow up to Kato's bookk. Whether you like it or hate it, it's important to understand the chinese formation.]

(;B[qo]TR[jp][jq]C[This move does follow basic opening principals
As per Yilun Yang 's book (http://www.slateandshell.com/libraryprod.asp?SSKey=SSYY006)

That said, in this particular position it is a little wierd. The triangles are normal developments for this corner, which you will note are toward's your opponent's stones. It would be nicer to have all 3 of your stones working together. 

Variations show the more common openings]
(;W[nc];B[qf]TR[qo]C[Very territorial, and you have made your side of the board hard to develop because both stones are low. This defiately leads to an early lead in territory, but makes future development  difficult.]
;W[jd]
(;B[jq]C[Low and seems slightly slow. No pressure on white here.]
;W[ci]TR[dc][jd][dp]C[White's stones are all working together. If black had this formation it would be a nearly ideal development of the Chinese Fuseki. The difference is it is your turn, so things are still not too far from even, but I feel like white is developing better.]

(;B[ce]C[Given that this is the same shape as the chinese fuseki, the same rules about invasion apply. This invasion point is exactly what white wants

Virtually any book on the chinese opening would be good to read. One (out of print) book that I like is "The Chinese Opening: a sure win strategy" by Kato Masao, but if you can't find that any book that deals with the chinese opening would be good to get. It's very common and pretty dangerous when one person knows it and the other doesn't.]

The primary problem for W is that W must reduce the center in sente and somehow come back to protect agains black C3. Black is stable all over and w is all alone. There is almost no chance of W ending in sente if black is careful

From here on I will mark every move that I think could have been played at C3. This is because the invasion is sooooo big that you really must remember it.]

[os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[[ekberg\] My tries to count gave fairly equal result and called for good endgame rather than spectacular invasions. Was I too optimistic, or did my endgame just stink?

Actually your counting needs work. There is still an invasion at c3, and while I think dan level players can force it into a ko when d6 isn't there there's a very good chance your opponent won't, and the effect of d6 might even stop that (this is beyond my ability to be certain). However, given that it is entirely inside w's prospective territory the ko would still be a loss for w.

Generally when I count I start by ONLY counting the points that are 100% guaranteed (assuming a normal local response). I've converted to circles all the points I feel are still in question. After counting the solid points check for any string of strong sente plays that would radically change the score. If you don't see them, then its likely that you and your oponent will split the difference on the remaining points.

So if you do invade I count you as ahead by a fair margin. This assumes that W is too timid, or not skilled enough to pull off a coresponding invasion at A, which is probably not feasible against dan level players, who will force W into the center where B is already powerful, but in kyu play it can still happen that A succeeds when it shouldn't.

I see 66 solid w points + 6.5 komi and 74 solid B points. (again assuming your opponent doesn't swindle you with A). The net result is that you made about as many errors for yourself as for your opponent when counting, so you got a good assesment, but the problem is The invasion at c3 is not optimistic. It's profitable, and required for the real score  :) jump to the end and count the territory you got in the center]
;W[rj]C[[ekberg\] Should I go for c3 here or continue the attack?]

(;B[qi]C[This is the mistake. You are inviting W to hit you on the head.]
;W[ri];B[rk];W[qj];B[pj]C[[ekberg\] maybe it was a mistake to save these two stones? I intended to keep the w group weak, but that made my wall weak as well.]

yeah you're chicken :) W can't kill either group until saving this. If you're worried, do something sente to fix one of them...]
