C[Please start the review from move 75.

Comments before will be appreciated, but my question is not really
there.

I feel my opponent is fairly weaker than me :
- he played  easy moves on Black formations, and did not present real
threats
- he let B eat most of its territory
- he played several non working kikashis in the end, that were easy to
read.

However, despite the difference of strenght I could really *feel* during
the game, I won by *only* 10 points

This appreciation does not relate to my feeling, but to the state of the
game at move 75.

What is really serious for me is that in most of my games, I am unable to
maintain an advantage I can create in the fuseki / chuban, and this game
is the most straight example.

I would like the reviewer to point out if possible the flaws in my hand
that lead to such a failure.

Andrew: Hi.

I started reviewing from the beginning, mainly because I believe that's where most problems start. The opening is easily as important as the middle and endgame.

I've offered some alternate moves, with a few sequences here and there.  Please don't treat these as the gospel truth; they are just suggestions, to be taken or left depending on their usefulness to you.

Main points of concern, as I see it: You are too caught up the moment. You attack groups that are strong, and leave unhealthy groups alone. You also fail to take secure points when you have the chance.

Slow down your game. Try to see the whole board, at each move, and always keep an eye out for the easiest, most clearly profitable course of action. This is often also the simplest way.

Your thinking should consist of three and only three things, before you begin any reading or tactical considerations:

1. Defense - Are your groups okay? Can you be hurt or hassled for profit. In other words, do you lack liberties, or a connection, or a base, or have some other glaring weakness? If not, then...

2. Attack - Are your opponent's groups okay? Can /he/ be hurt or hassled for profit? Never attack to kill, unless you're certain of it. Always do it with profit in mind, and always attack the weakest group (unless doing a leaning attack - see Kato's Attack and Kill for more on this).

If all groups are healthy, then...

3. Big! Find the biggest open area and play in it. If all things are equal, play on your side (it's easier developing a framework than invading). Remember, gote is okay too, especially when defending. Big points are also often gote.

Your main problem in the endgame is a tendency to play small moves in the centre, and taking gote when perfectly good sente or reverse sente moves can be found elsewhere. Once again, try to see the whole board, and don't feel you have to respond locally to every move your opponent makes.

I hope my review helped. If you have any questions about my above comments, anything I've said (or neglected to say) about your game, or go in general, feel free to ask.

Cheers,

My count is as follow :

10 left

20 bottom

White 20 :
20 top

Moreover, B managed to play further in the game at R4 and C3.


However, I managed so badly as to win the game by only 10 points. This is
beyond my understanding, and reflects the majority of my games.

Could you try to point out :

- what should be the basic strategy to implement, and how it should have
worked out.
- where I boldly diverged from a said strategy, or where I missed
important plays (apart from move 173)
- important yose moves I missed.

L13 would secure 5 points or so.

Andrew: A7 is definitely too small, and gote. S5 is worth approximately 6, with some very appetizing follow up potential.

Remember: corner, side, centre. This is an especially good guideline for the endgame. 

Ultimately, however, I think the f3 stone is in need for defense.]
;W[kg];B[ii];W[ki];B[li];W[lh];B[jh];W[kh];B[jk]C[This has got to be worth maybe 1 point. Why so fixated on making a few points in the centre, when there are reverse sente moves in the corner that need to be taken care of? P19, for example, is worth 4 points for white in sente. Not to mention white S14 and S5.

Try to find moves that remove white's good endgame plays.];W[hm]
;B[gn]C[Here I think I misplayed.
Protecting at F2 should have been better, probably.
