C[Dear reviewer,

This game was played at the tournament in Castrop-Rauxel , Germany.
I played black in this game.
I already lost the game after move 56.
The rest of the game is a struggle to get a moyo as compensation, but this cannot work really.
Would you please so kind to give me some hints.

Thank you in advance,

LB[mc:A][qe:B]TR[do]C[It would be better to play A first.  White would probably reply by stabilizing his side stones.

In general terms, this move looks wrong.  W is probably not going to play here because it would be a bad relationship to the marked stone.]
;W[nc]C[This is what B needed to prevent by playing around here first.  It is bigger than the bottom.]

(;B[lc]C[This looks doubtful as B is split when W jumps out.]

(;B[me]LB[nd:A][qd:B]C[this move leaves a bad weak point at A.  Better for B to play there himself.  It is reall very hard for B to attack the 2 stones below, so the block at B was on the wrong side.]
