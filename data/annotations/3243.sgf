C[Vorkosigan: Hi, my name is Jun (vorkosigan on igs). I am playing Go for about four months now and I would generally like to know how to improve my game. I just about won by 1.5 moku. I would like to know on which part of my play I should try to improve next. Thank you kindly for your efforts.


Black: doctorwho (IGS 21k)
White: vorkosigan (IGS 21k)

[Rich\]: Hi, I'm Richard; I'll give you some general tips throughout on what to look for, and more detail at the end.  Basically, don't use thickness to surround territory, and don't make contact to attack.]
;B[cq];W[pd];B[dn]C[Vorkosigan: This keima seemed strange to me, but i just ignored it, since I didn't know how to answer it.

[Rich\]: You don't have to answer it at all - at least, not straight away. It's a small play by black, and you get to choose which corner to take now.]
;W[pq]C[Vorkosigan: 4 was maybe to low against the black stones on the left.

[Rich\]: 4 is fine. The two black stones are not that big a threat.]
;B[dd]
(;W[dp]C[[Rich\]: This is a very strange move; you leap right into the opponent's strongest area. This means that he can chase you around, threaten you, bully you to play how he wants because he outnumbers you by one stone and sente. He'll make himself stronger; when stones are touching, they both usually strengthen each other. Contact plays are for defence, not offence.

Firstly, I would approach the other stone, on the open side. Give yourself room, and don't panic about the two stones. Otherwise, playing the lower middle point could be good. See variations.]
;B[cp];W[do]C[[Rich\] - you're running into his stone, helping to surround yourself while you're weak. Perhaps jumping out along the side would be preferable...]
;B[co];W[dq];B[dr]C[[Rich\]: This is a bad shape for your three stones to be in.]
;W[er];B[ds];W[es];B[br];W[go]LB[fp:X]C[[Rich\]: this leaves black a good play at X; this point, in the middle of three stones, is often one to watch out for. See var.]

(;B[eq]C[This cut should have been played at one of the variation points.]
;W[fq];B[ep];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[jq];W[mq]C[[Rich\] - This is good. You have influence in the lower left, so you attack by playing the other side, forcing him into a cramped area. You don't bump against him, so he can't build himself up either. This is how you should use influence and attack! :)]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[lr]
(;W[mr]C[[Rich\] - rather than follow him (playing on the second line is usually quite a small move in the beginning unless you're linking stones together), I'd have stopped the cut (see var.)]
;B[kp];W[lo];B[ko]
(;W[pn]C[[Rich\]: in situations like these, where stones are running up against each other, it's almost always better with two stones to either extend or bend around the top of the stones you're pushing against. See variation.]
;B[no];W[np];B[oo];W[op];B[po];W[qo];B[mo];W[mp];B[ln]
(;W[ip]C[[Rich\]: This is a position that often comes up; a lone stone blocking a string of enemy stones. You can very often get two moves on one side of the stone by cutting the other side. It's a very useful position to know about! See variation.

As it is, this is a reasonable move but doesn't really pressure black. Look to expand your groups by pressuring the opponent.]
;B[jn];W[iq];B[qn];W[qp];B[pm];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[cj];W[jd]
C[[Rich\] - Good play.];B[mc];W[kc]C[[Rich\] - I would have approached from the other side; there are a lot of points to be found in the corners, and your upper left group is still quite open.]
;B[pb]
(;W[pi]C[[Rich\] - black has influence below, so watch out - playing this close means you could get pincered (and you do!).

Where the enemy is thick (has a lot of live stones to intimidate you with), approach from a distance. Where you are thick, play at a distance. See var.]

;B[oa];W[mb];B[oc]LB[od:X][lc:Y]C[Vorkosigan: I had wondered if I should close at X or play Y first. If B had played X I would have been pushed around. Why I chose Y instead I forgot.

[Rich\] - Capturing the single stone is better here. Black can't push through at X at the moment, but he can eat away at your territory on the side if he plays 1 space above Y. See var.

I would have played atari from the other side. See var.]
(;W[lc]
(;B[cf]TR[mc]C[[Rich\] - Now black's stone TRIANGLE has potential to cause problems. see var.]
;W[od];B[ob];W[dg];B[df];W[bg];B[bf]
(;W[ef]C[[Rich\] - You're attacking from a weak position; if black counter-cuts you're totally eyeless and surrounded, and the ladder at the cut is blocked by that thick black wall in the lower right if you extend. See var.]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[eg];W[ff];B[eh]
(;W[dk]LB[jf:X]TR[dn][en]C[Vorkosigan: I chose this shoulderhit in order to get influence towards the center. Now i think it was wrong because of the marked black stones. I should have played something like X instead.
I have the feeling that not playing X was one of my biggest mistakes in this game.

[Rich\] - You have black influence either side of you; if he plays well he will chase you into the middle and you could lose everything!

X is small - If you want to make territory around X, you need to strengthen the groups either side; let their influence do the work for you. The stronger the groups, the more influence they have. See var.]

;B[he]C[Vorkosigan: This peep annoyed me :-)
But I decided to play save and went underneath instead of sealing it in. I wonder if it may have worked.

[Rich\] - This is an invasion, not a peep. Attack it! :) Your TRIANGLE stone is well-placed.

When you have influence nearby, the fighting favours you. The more influence, the better. That's why you never play close to thickness - if it's yours, you want to drive your opponent towards it, if it's their they'll chop you up. See var.]

;B[dm];W[em];B[bm];W[fk]LB[gm:X][gk:Y]C[Vorkosigan: Should have saved the cut at X I think. Maybe with Y.

[Rich\] - Definitely, your centre-left group is still just short of two eyes. A play at X would give black a free peep at 120; one point above X would be better, defending both cuts.]
;B[gm];W[gl];B[hm];W[hl];B[im];W[il];B[jl]C[[Rich\] - because of the cut, he can chase you now.]

[Rich\] - The enemy's territory always looks bigger :) Especially for white, who has komi.

Depending on how fast the game was, it's worth comparing your territories one for one with black. For example, very quickly by sight, your bottom right and his top left are equal, his top and bottom right about the same as your top, centres about the same, your lower left slightly bigger.  Plus you have 6 komi, but he has 11 prisoners; close game. :)]

Vorkosigan: In this game I tried to use the tipp I got very often: Use your wall. But I still have problems using this concept. Besides I often had problems handling Bs invasions. He never seemed to have problems getting life. My win was based on pure luck.

[Rich\] - It's a lot easier said than done, using thickness. The basic trick is to play away from it. Trap your opponent against it, make it hard for him to fight, and build yourself up on the other side. Similarly, don't play close to your opponent's thickness, or the same will happen to you. Build up your strength first, then approach and eat away at his territory.

It takes practice and experience to know just what you can get away with. Also, don't worry if you don't make territory next to your influence, if you can use it to make territory somewhere else (see the variation on move 28). 

Invasions mean one of two things; the area you were looking to surround is too big (it's a moyo, rather than solid territory) or your opponent is mistaken/trying to trick you. If it's the former, attack his stone but don't expect to kill it - you can perhaps chase it into his area and take some of his territory back, or you can solidify it into territory. Generally, attacking stones don't make contact with their target; they make it difficult for the target stones to settle themselves instead.

If it's the latter, have fun trying to kill him! Life and death is something you can never stop learning, but you can get a good feel for vital points just by playing a lot and solving tsumego.

Move 6 was, in my opinion, the weakest move of the game; both because it went straight into an attack on a corner enclosure - use the opening to settle a few stones and then attack - and also because it seemed very aggressive, but it led to a lot of contact plays, which are usually defensive. Since black had the lead in getting two stones there first, he had potentially a large area in the corner and you were lucky not to lose anything.

I think with a bit of experience using thickness and getting used to the direction of play, you could improve quickly. You played a good endgame. If you have any further questions please drop me an email.]
