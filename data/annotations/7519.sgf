C[yoyoma:  Here is the review.  Hope you find it useful.];B[qd]
;W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[cn]C[I think C6 adds value to D17...

If I play F3 or O3 white pincer attack becomes powerful.

yoyoma:  Yes it's the normal way to play.];W[fq];B[ck];W[co]

(;B[dn]C[is it necessary?

yoyoma:  This is the normal answer to white's kick.  See variation for another possibility, but in this situation your move seems best.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[ob]C[I haven't seen this move very often.  But Kitani Minoru 9p liked it.]

(;W[ne]C[should I play R13(or R14/Q14)?

yoyoma: This move means white wants to concentrate on the center.  Here it doesn't seem that good.  Black should play on the shape point Q16.]

(;B[nq];W[qn];B[kq];W[qe]C[Black should not have allowed this move.]
;B[re];W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[rg];W[qh];B[pd]C[I don't know if whithe can attack the corner (maybe with R17 or Q17)

yoyoma:  I don't see any problem for black in the corner now.  After crawling on the second line 3 times black took gote here also, not good.]

(;W[ei];B[bg]C[Good.];W[cf];B[dj];W[bf];B[id];W[db];B[eb];W[cb]

(;B[fc]C[could I omit F17?

yoyoma:  It's possible, but not bad to play it either.];W[gh]

(;B[hg]C[does G11 work better?

yoyoma: G11 is a severe shape point type move, but here I think white will get away too easily.  Also it's not clear the best direction to attack these white stones from, so maybe you can wait.  If white continues to run he won't make many points either.]
;W[gg];B[gf];W[hh];B[ig];W[hk]
(;B[fk];W[ji]LB[ji:B][fk:A]C[I think white's B is more valuable than black's A.  White is starting to connect all the stones on the left, and it starts looking like a moyo.]

(;B[hq];W[lp]C[Nice idea for white.];B[lq];W[np];B[mp];W[mo]

;W[ko];B[ni]C[Black continues to come into the moyo, eventually if white keeps defending points his group above gets in more and more danger.  Seems good for black.]
