Hi,

I play black and won by resign.  I have a question however.
In this particular game there was quite a ko
fight in the corner that you can see.  At move 65... should I have gone
some where like I did to get to center or was F4 a good connect ?  Did
I take a big risk by not connecting here?  Should I have gone elsewhere
to avoid the ko fights or did I play them correctly?  If I had played a
better person...  I would have been in trouble I think....

Thank you for your input.
