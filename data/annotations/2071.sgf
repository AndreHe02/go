C[pajaro: Hi. This is my review of yor game. I'll add some variations, but I think the most important is that you understand the meaning of the moves rather than the moves themselves. Also keep in minfd that your opponent is a machine. Don't trust it very much ;)]
;B[od]C[pajaro: The first move, and yet not very good. You should usually start in 4-4, 3-4 or 3-3 points. 5th line is more difficult to handle (I've never played it).]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]
(;B[ep]C[pajaro: When you approach a corner, you should not attach an enemy stone. In general: Don't attach what you are atacking. See vars for usual moves.]
;W[do]C[pajaro: As your move is not usual, the answer isn't either. But you can see that white's position is slightly better.]
;B[ef]C[pajaro: Again, this isn't an usual approach (see move 4). You seem to be playing toward the centre. We'll see.]
;W[nq]
(;B[mq]C[pajaro: Again touching the enemy stone. If you want to attack it from this side, you can do, but keep some space, (see var).]
;W[np];B[mo];W[mp]C[pajaro: As you touched the white stone, now it can counterattck and split you in two.]
;B[kp];W[lq];B[kq];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[qf];B[rd];W[rc]

(;B[qg]C[pajaro: I expected you to play s14. See var.];W[pf]
;B[of];W[og]
(;B[pg]C[pajaro: s14 again.];W[rf];B[pd];W[qc];B[pc]C[pajaro: empty triangle. bad]
;W[oh]
(;B[ph]C[pajaro: empty triangle again. very bad. you are going to see how white is going to crush black. r11 is a better move.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[qh];B[ed];W[dc];B[ec];W[lg];B[le];W[jf]
(;B[je]C[pajaro: you seemed to want the side. But by touching the enemy stone, it will be easier for white to invade.]
;W[ie];B[ke];W[id];B[if]C[pajaro: good. you split white in two. now, attack it.]
;W[ge]
(;B[gd]C[pajaro: don't touch (again)];W[hf]C[pajaro: good shape for white. it will be easy for him to escape towards the centre.]
;B[ig];W[hd]
(;B[fd]C[pajaro: empty triangle. see g17.];W[ib];B[kg]C[pajaro: good shape, now black can fight better.]
;W[lh];B[kc];W[kb];B[lb];W[oj];B[ni]C[pajaro: you are saving a non-worthy stone. Let white take it, and take sente to keep on attacking white.]
;W[de]
(;B[ee]C[pajaro: again, you should make a bamboo joint in f14.]
;W[cg];B[dh];W[gh];B[jb];W[dg];B[df]C[pajaro: you try to split two connected groups. In the real game, white didn't connect, but anyway, you musn't play it.]
;W[gc];B[cf]C[pajaro: good, punish white for his mistake.];W[ch]
;B[eh]C[pajaro: again, don't save this stone, but kill the white corner.]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[fh];B[gg];W[hg];B[ff]C[pajaro: look, your group can't go to the centre anymore. Your only chance is to kill the d17 group.]
;W[be];B[ce];W[ei];B[di]C[pajaro: this is a schicho. Forget the dead stones and attack!]
;W[dj]
(;B[bf]C[pajaro: better C16];W[bd];B[af]C[pajaro: this doesn't help you. Your only chance is to kill white. Isolation is not enough.]
;W[eb];B[cd];W[cc];B[fb];W[da];B[ea]C[pajaro: you put yourself in atari! This time you play a computer, and its answer isn't good either, but be careful.]
;W[db];B[fa];W[ih];B[jg]C[pajaro: The white group has escaped and the game is over.   My comments end here. My advices are:
- see other people's games. have a look at their openings, where they play,.. and where nobody do ;)  - Don't touch what you are attacking. This is a golden rule.
- Attack to gain territory or power, not just to kill.
- Don't try to save every stone. Think whether it is important or not: does it keep a connection? is it the door to a big territory? in a word, why do you want to save it?

Hope this will help.];W[fn];B[gp];W[dq];B[eq];W[qn];B[po];W[lr]
