C[sronen71 [9k\]: Hi

Hi, my name is Philip and I'm 1d AGA. I'll mark my comments with P:]
;B[qd];W[od];B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[qc];W[nd];B[re];W[qf]
;B[qp];W[op]C[P: White's play is of course aggressive, but so far all the moves seem fine.]
;B[qm]LB[lp:B][mq:A][oq:C]C[P: I'd prefer a pincer here around A or B. The bottom is more open than the right side, so black should develop there instead. Black could also play C to achieve a more solid position.]
;W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[qj];W[rf]C[P: This move is very slow.]
;B[rd]C[P: This move is really bad. With two corners open, black is playing a gote endgame move.]
;W[rr];B[rp]C[P: Again, black is playing very slowly.];W[lq]
C[P: This is also slow. White here is solid and not easily attacked. The open corners are huge.]
;B[dd];W[fd];B[dc]LB[df:A]C[P: Black needs to jump at A.];W[jd]
;B[cg];W[nc]C[P: This move is slow as well.];B[dp]LB[dq:A]C[P: Good. Black could also consider A, as it works well with the position up top.]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[dr];B[cq];W[iq]LB[hp:A]C[P: White should play A here to create a better balance.]
;B[ck];W[ci];B[eg]C[P: Good. Black is winning now.];W[ei];B[ek]
;W[gi];B[gg];W[ff];B[fg];W[de];B[ee];W[df];B[ef];W[dg]
(;B[ce]C[P: See variation];W[dh];B[ed]LB[cf:A]C[P: Black should play at A here. If white cuts, the fight in the center is reasonable for black.]
;W[cf];B[hd];W[be];B[cd]C[P: Again, this move is slow.];W[id]
;B[he];W[hc];B[gc];W[ic];B[gd]LB[gb:A]C[P: A is better.];W[pl]
;B[ql];W[pk];B[qk];W[on];B[pj]LB[go:A][jo:B]C[P: This move is slow. Black should consider a reduction at A or B.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[fn];B[nj];W[nl];B[gk];W[hm];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo]
;W[go];B[eq];W[fr];B[er];W[es];B[cr];W[gq]LB[jl:A]C[P: This move is not needed. White should complete his moyo with A.]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[lf]C[P: These stones are not as useful as a reduction on the bottom would be.]
;W[kd];B[me];W[md];B[le];W[og];B[lh];W[jg];B[ji];W[ih];B[bd]
LB[ml:A]C[P: Slow. Black should attach at A.];W[bf];B[bi];W[bj]
;B[cj];W[bh];B[bk];W[ai];B[km];W[ko];B[mm];W[mk];B[nm];W[om]
;B[jk]C[P: This is a good sequence for black.];W[mj];B[hi];W[hh]
;B[ml];W[nk];B[ii];W[gj];B[hk];W[fk];B[fl];W[fj];B[el];W[gl]
;B[hl];W[gm];B[im];W[in];B[jm];W[kj];B[ki];W[li];B[mi];W[lj]
;B[kh];W[jj]LB[ni:A]C[P: Black has to connect his stones with A here. White K10 was not a threat to disconnect black.]
;B[ij];W[mh];B[mg];W[nh];B[jf];W[kg];B[kf];W[if];B[lg];W[ie]
;B[mo]LB[nf:A]C[P: Black should play at A to make two eyes. This is the final losing move.]
;W[ln];B[mn];W[lm];B[ll];W[kk];B[kl];W[nf];B[il];W[hj];B[mq]
;W[lp];B[lo];W[kn];B[jn];W[jo];B[io];W[hn];B[mp];W[lr];B[or]
;W[mr];B[nq];W[pp];B[gh];W[ni];B[pr];W[qr];B[oo];W[po];B[no]
;W[pn];B[nr];W[ip];B[kp];W[jp];B[kq];W[kr]C[P: Overall, black has a good knowledge of tactics. However, there were several times in which black played moves which were very slow. My recommendation would be to try to look at each game from a more global perspective. In this way, black can make moves which are best for the overall position, instead of just locally.]
)
(;B[dh]C[P: If black plays here, the white stones will die. White's attempt to cut is unreasonable.]
;W[ce];B[ch];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[bf];W[ed];B[fb]C[P: White will be captured.]
