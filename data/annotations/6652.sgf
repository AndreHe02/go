C[[Calvin\]: Hi.  I will be commenting on your game.  Remember that I am only about 4-5 kyu KGS, so much of what I say could be wrong.  You should verify and research things for yourself.   My general comments are at the end of the game.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de]LB[ep:A][eq:B]C[[Calvin\]: The opening so far is a common one.  Usually black approaches at A or B instead of D15, but this move is very big, too.]

(;W[cd]LB[fc:A][fd:B][di:C][ci:D]C[[Calvin\]: This is a typical beginner mistake.  This move is usually only played when white has stones already in place such as at A, B, C, or D.   Then, the intention would be to make black's group heavy for attack.  Here, it is a 1-one-1 fight, so this strategy will not work.

See variations for other ideas for white.];B[ce]
(;W[gc]C[[Calvin\]: This move is too low and doesn't put sufficient pressure on black.  If white wants simple territory, it would have been better to play 8 at 7.]
;B[di]LB[ic:A][fd:B]C[[Calvin\]: You see that black gets an ideal extension.   Also, black A (J17) is sente and black B (F17) can be useful forcing move.]

(;W[dg]SQ[gc]LB[ed:A][fc:B]C[I answered this move with a sequence which gave me a pretty fine result I think. White didn't get that much actual profit and black got a good wall. Was this a correct way to play it, or are there any beetr more conventional ways? aswell for black as for white.

[Calvin\]: White's move is an overplay.  First of all, white's extension at the top is thinner than the usual plays at A or B.  Secondly, this higher extension at D11 is harder to invade.]
;B[cg]C[[Calvin\]: Of course.];W[ch];B[dh];W[cf];B[bg];W[bf]
;B[df];W[be];B[eg]C[[Calvin\]: The result clearly favors black.  It white just wants more territory, white could have played the hane at B15 directly without this invasion which has strengthened black.]
;W[bh]C[[Calvin\]: This move is not a good idea for white.]

(;B[ci]C[[Calvin\]:  See variation.];W[ag]
(;B[dg]C[[Calvin\]: Black should tenuki.];W[ah]C[[Calvin\]: White should tenuki.]
;B[bi];W[bd];B[ai]C[[Calvin\]: This kind of move should be saved as a ko threat for the endgame.   First of all, in the opening white may not answer this because capturing those stones is gote and not so big.]

(;W[af]C[[Calvin\]: White may tenuki.];B[ep]SQ[eg]MA[bc][ac]
[ad][ae]C[[Calvin\]: The result is clearly good for black.  The marked points represent the increase in white's territory.  Since black played the high extenion, black was not expecting much territory on the side anyway.  Black's wall has a wasted move (E13) but is very strong and black took sente.

E4 is perfect.  Black develops on a whole-board scale and white is confined to the corner.  It is looking like a handicap game for black now.]
;W[gp]
(;B[en]C[[Calvin\]: This is the usual move, but maybe a special plan is in order due to black's thickness.   See variation.]
;W[cn]
(;B[dm]C[[Calvin\]: See variation.];W[dr];B[dq];W[cq];B[er]
;W[jd];B[lc];W[nc]LB[le:A]C[Again for the follow-up on this move. Is my answer ok, or did I have to approach this stone from another side in order to correspond with the stones already on the board? I thought this sequence gave me a fair result by making shure I kept the corner to myself, Although white had a chance of trying to get me into trouble a few moves later by playing R17 8 moves later.

[Calvin\]: At this point you have to decide what's important, because the top is white's sphere of influence.  Probably the worst thing for black would be to jump at A.]

(;B[nd]SQ[lc]C[[Calvin\]: I think this is a good move, as long as you treat the marked stone lightly.   See variation for a bad move :-)]
;W[od]SQ[nd]C[[Calvin\]: To play this wedge, white needs to check the ladder to capture the O16 stone.  This ladder is not working, so white can't play this way right now.]

(;B[oc]LB[oe:A]C[[Calvin\]: This is proper since white didn't check the ladder, but black may be able to choose the outside atari at A as a variation.]

(;W[md]C[[Calvin\]: This move is a mistake.]
(;B[mc]LB[oe:A]C[[Calvin\]: Black should take the ponnuki at P15 without hestitation.   See variation.]

(;B[pl]C[[Calvin\]: I don't like this pincer here in this situation.   Remember that black wants to play K4, maybe even immediately.   This move doesn't do so much.]
;W[rg];B[sd];W[ql]
(;B[rd]C[[Calvin\]: See variation.];W[qk];B[qi]SQ[pl][qk]C[[Calvin\]: I don't think this invasion is a great idea for black.  It looks as if black has just played the marked exchange, strengthening white and then decided to invade. 

(In fact, that's not even tewari, but the actual sequence of moves. :-)

Without that exchange, maybe the invasion would work out better.]

(;W[ri]C[[Calvin\]: I'm not sure white should defend this garbage stones right away.  See variation.]
;B[rj];W[pi];B[rh];W[ph];B[sg]

;B[si];W[qj];B[ri];W[jp]SQ[dm][en][ep][dq][er]C[[Calvin\]: It seems that white has caught up a bit.  Black has too much second line territory on the right side that's not adding up to much.  If you go back and compare to the position where black takes the ponnuki, you can see this is relatively much better for white.

K4 is a very big point, which negates the effect of black's marked wall.  (Compare to a black play there.)

Black had a very clear lead at move 29, but now has to worry about losing on territory.]

(;B[mp]SQ[gp][jp][pq]C[[Calvin\]: This move dosen't put pressure on white's marked stones sufficiently and R5 is already strong.  Also, the marked shape is thin, so it's a half-measure.]

[Calvin\]: It shows good thinking, but you have to remember that the marked connection is not so strong for black, so it might be on overplay.

General comments:

Black had a great opening due to white's emphasis on small territorial points.  The position at move 29 is very favorable for black.  However, the handling of white's invasion at move 40 shows incorrect judgement.  Taking the ponnuki at 45 is mandatory and would be consistent with black's thick positions elsewhere on the board.   Black 45 in the game is probably one of the worst mistakes I saw.  Please go back to that move, view the black ponnuki variation, and try to appreciate how superior black's position is that way.

Black's invasion at 71 was overplay, I think.

The next big turnaround in the game came after black 93.   Please understand when you play a move that makes your opponent stronger, it may expose a weakness in a nearby group.  I think it was unrealistic for black to try to kill white in the bottom right.  Move 105 looks like it might be severe, but white has many sente forcing moves in the corner and black tried for too much.

Black should try to play more honte (honest, proper) moves, and overplay less.  When you have a thick position, you have to be patient.  Because you may be behind in territory, you should not expect to catch up until the endgame unless you get lucky and score a big kill.  (And you can't rely on the big kill.)

As for white, white needs to learn the big points in the opening.  There are some books on this, but studying the first 30-50 moves of many professional games is a fun and effective way to improve one's feeling for the opening.

White managed to turn the game around with a spectacular kill in the lower corner, but failed to defend his weak group on the right side.  When a huge change occurs like that, both players should reassess the board, look for weak groups, and count the score.  White could have had a very easy win after that kill with a simple defense, but black managed to score a counter-kill, make the game close, and eventually win.

Thank you for submitting this exciting game.  It was fun for me to review, and I hope you can get something out of my comments, weak as they are.]
