C[Hi, I am Marco and I will be reviewing this game for Black.
I will tryto focus a bit more on general principles then lots of concrete variations.]
;B[pd]C[Hi, thanks in advance for reviewing. I play black.

I am really interested on fuseki and general flow of the game, even more than in concrete plays]

C[I have yet to study these josekis, R5 is not joseki. How should white punish it? Also, given the board position, which move should follow R8?

What White did in the game was a good way of punishing it I think.
If you just look at the end result, White is getting 2 solid groups with a fair amount where as Black is not getting much.
I think playing around O4 would be better for black, attacking the corner stone from 2 sides. See the Kogo joseki dictionary for more details on this variation.]
;W[qp];B[nn];W[np];B[ok];W[pj];B[oj];W[pi];B[qf]C[I wanted some center influence with P9 and P10, perhaps R14 only helped white get settled.

I am not too sure about the influence here, you center group is quite weak here.
You also don't have a moyo, so it's hard to use those center stones efficiently.
As for R14 move, I won't criticize it, it seems really urgent at this moment.]
;W[qh];B[pc];W[rn];B[qm]C[Not sure about R7

It doesn't do much.
I am inclined to think taking sente is better.
However you if do want to play in this area, S5 is better I think.]

;W[pl];B[qn]C[Defending here is a waste of time, just take sente now.]
;W[dh]C[Was C13 a good answer?];B[cg]C[I think playing at F10 is better here. You keep him weak that way and you can keep attacking him.]
