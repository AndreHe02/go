C[Hi im dawid. I dont know what to say abot the game. Thanks for commentary



inimino: Hi dawid, my remarks and variations are throughout, hopefully they will be interesting.

Please feel free to ask me any questions or send back the SGF again with more variations, etc, if I missed anything!]

(;B[op]C[inimino: B mistake, should be O3.];W[nq];B[mq];W[mr]
;B[lr];W[ns];B[lp]C[Maybe its also good to leave that two stones?


inimino: Yes, I would leave these two stones for now.  Maybe you can play around R10 or Q9, and let b decide how to deal with those two stones on the outside.

Either way, the rest of the board is wide open and trying to run out with those two stones right now is too early... better to make b capture them, or threaten to use them, than to actually try to save them at all costs.]
;W[ol];B[pj];W[rn];B[so];W[mo];B[mp];W[pl];B[qk];W[qm]C[i think its bad move. My idea was to get eyes by r7 but in s7 idont have any and in q7 also


inimino: You are right, It is not a good shape.

However, the bigger problem might be the strategy problem of getting embroiled in trying to make life here, rather than treating those two stones as light.

Now b gets to make a nice living group along the right side, while you try to make life, and the b wall on the bottom is perfectly placed.

Going back to move 25, we can see this is a good example of the proverb "don't play too close to thickness."  In this case b has a thick outside position surrounding the corner group, and to add more stones to the two already there on the outside is probably not the best.]
;B[kn];W[nj];B[qf]C[inimino: This is probably a little too far from b's existing group.  I would play R12 here and see what b can do.]
;W[oi]C[and what about that?


inimino:  If R12 is a strong move which takes advantage of b's weakness, this is a move which encourages b to fix the problem.  If b plays Q11 or R12 here, there is no more weakness, and the advantage to w of this stone on the outside does not seem to me enough compensation.]
;B[qh];W[od];B[mc]
(;W[of]C[inimino: This move feels small, because there are not many points here for either player, and the b right side group is settled so this is not really sente.

Maybe w can find a better way to strengthen the floating center group.

Q13 looks sente and probably helps the w group at P11 about as much as this move.]
;B[jc];W[re];B[rf]
(;W[gc]C[inimino: This seems to be the wrong direction, I think the top right corner still needs more moves.  I prefer O17 here.]
;B[pc]C[inimino: It looks like b had the same idea...];W[oc]
;B[ob];W[pd];B[qb];W[qc];B[pb]C[inimino: This is a painful result for w, not only because of the points lost, but also because the floating center stones around Q7 are now joined by these others, and none are absolutely alive.]
;W[dn];B[kk];W[rl];B[rk];W[cp]C[inimino: Now the w player has played elsewhere for three moves: G17, D6, C4.  These moves are big, but the situation with the stones in the center is urgent.  B can easily give up D4 entirely if it means killing some or all center stones.  So w cannot play these moves, instead the center situation must be dealt with.

The tenuki moves seem greedy, w wants to take territory but neglects to fix his weak groups, which are more important.]
;B[oj];W[nk];B[ni]C[

here the cut was painful


inimino: Perhaps w can fight a little bit here, see the variation starting with Q11, but it's uncertain and dangerous.

The mistakes are in the previous moves in which w allowed this position to become so weak.  After tenuki, tenuki, tenuki, w should not be surprised to come under a fierce attack here.

See variations on the next move for some ways w can fight, but none of them look very convincing.]

inimino: Also, the stones in the center will have a harder time now.  This is still just the cost of the moves G17, D6, and C4.]

(;W[bo]C[inimino: F5 seems bigger here.];B[eo]
(;W[en]C[inimino: I would play F4 and fight instead.  W cannot afford to give up so many solid points to b without a fight here.]
;B[fo];W[fn];B[go];W[kj];B[jk];W[jj];B[ik];W[ij];B[gk]
(;W[hj]C[inimino: Here, locally it is better to play H9 and create a defect in the black shape.

(Incidentally, if there was a white stone at H9 later, the center group would have more easily made life.)

However, at this point I would play P12 instead and see if w can possibly cut at M14 or threaten to kill the side group.]
;B[hk]
(;W[cj]C[inimino: This is very small.  P12 is much better.  W already will get a lot of points here, so a play here is not interesting, and this stone adds very little.

As with the moves starting with G17 before, w is playing "big moves", or moves that look big, but there are still unsettled groups and fighting going on, which is much bigger.]

However, O7 can make w alive, and you can push first at G13, etc.]

misread


inimino: Here it seems w is already dead, see var.];B[ml];W[lm]
;B[ll];W[kl]C[and here starts frustration moves without hope

inimino: Ending the review here... In summary I think your biggest mistake in this game was too much concern with "big moves" and an obvious concern with territory, instead of an awareness of weakness of groups, and trying to make all groups strong.

The original cause of all the trouble was, as you noticed, trying to save the two stones in the lower right very early in the game, which gave you a weak group which never fully recovered.  In your next game try not to worry about territory so much, and if you have a weak group, strengthen it before you do anything else!  If you can avoid creating weak groups at all, so much the better...

Hope this helps, please let me know if you have any questions or thoughts.]
