C[Dear reviewer,

in this game I played White through internet on the KGS server as <tomjk>. Time limit was 30 min.

I have added numerous comments which are preceeded by <tomjk> in which I explain why I made my moves. I hope this will help you to review my game.

The opening and the middle game was domintated by Black who got a big lead in the game as the endgame drew close..
I, as White (tomjk), had much trouble finding the right responses and I think my overall strategy and judgement of the global situation was not so good.

I lost much potential territory by trying to get my center group alive, after I had it abbandoned for some time. This is quite typical for my style of play (to abandon groups for a long time and then later try to save them desperately). Any sugggestions on these issues will be highly appreaciated.

I (tomjk) was then able to get nearly all the big endgame points and therefore managed to have a small lead near the end.

Black with  the last moves made some errors which lead then to resignation by Black.

Thank you very much for reviewing this game and your time.

Thomas (tomjk on IGS and KGS)



Erik:

Hi Thomas,

It was a pleasure to comment your game.   I hope you will have any use for my comments. Don't be dicouraged if the comments sound a bit negative, I just can't help it ;)

Please contact me if you have more questions.

I decided not to play in the remaining corner, but deprive Black of the shimari.
I did not want Black  to map out a potential big moyo on the bottom (see variation).

Erik:

Another strategy is to build a corresponding moyo on the upper side. I hope C5 is not played by greed, not letting black get anything. You can't get anything if you don't let the oppontent get something in return:)]
;B[fp];W[dl]C[<tomjk>
I play the large knights move, since Black played the small knights move which is not so tight on my stone at C5. I am aware that Black has move C7 in reserve to attack my group,  but since the corner is  still open I am confident to get life there if necessary.]

(;B[pd]LB[pj:a][jq:b][jc:c][jd:d][nc:e]C[<tomjk>
Now it is time to do something to avoid that Black gets a double-wing formation with Black (a) and (b).

Erik:

Note that (a) and (b) are two moves, so you can always get one of them. (c),(d) and (e) are good moves too,  building a moyo for yourself.

It seems that you are a bit too concerned about your opponents possibillities. You should also try to make your opponent worried about your moyos :)]
;W[qj]C[<tomjk>
I play the splitting attack and wait what Black will do.];B[fc]

[dl:i]SQ[co][dl]C[<tomjk>
I did not want the exchange White (a) or (b) and Black (c), since I already played three stones on this side.
I thought playing another stone on the left side would be not so efficiently using my stones.

If Black jumps into the corner at 3-3 I was ready to block at (d) and build up a wall to work together with the stone at J17.

I thought the stones marked with squares were too far away to build an efficient wall by blocking at (e) - see variation at move 12.

Erik:   This first question is: A pincer or not?
You will see in the variation that follow that it is difficult to find a good sequence with a pincer. The reason is that (i) is a bit  too far avay to make a wall in this direction effective.

(a) or (b)  is not bad at all, since you will get sente.

You choose a pincer, that's ok, but the choice of pincer is not. It's not so easy to explain why, but you will see in some variations later that (f) and (g) are better. (h) is also good here.]

(;W[ce]C[Erik: Oh dear :)

This mistake is so common, that it even has got an own webpage:

(;B[be]C[Erik: Black is kind to you :)];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[db]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]LB[kc:a][jd:b][fc:c]SQ[ic]C[<tomjk>
I must admit that the the stone marked with a square is a bit too close to my wall now. I would like to have it at (a) or (b) now ... ;-)

Erik: But (c) has become very bad here, so white should be satisfied with this exchange.]
;B[ee];W[de]LB[fe:a][ge:b]C[<tomjk>
I did not play at (a), because I did not want to weaken my stone at J17 in an ensuing fight if Black then plays at (b) for example.
So I simply connected to keep things simple for me. Now the two Black stones look lonely attached to a big white wall. This should be good for White.

Any ideas to play in a different way?

Erik:
No, when black is creating a heavy group close to your wall, you should be very happy :)]
;B[hd];W[id];B[he];W[hc];B[gc];W[fe]LB[ie:a][nc:b]C[<tomjk>
I wanted to keep me a target to chase around, so I tried to rob the eye from Black.

Looking at it now I think that playing simply at (a) with Black to respond locally to save his group and then White (b) would have been much better.

What do you think?

Erik: If black needs to life with a small group you should be very happy, so you should try to fence in the group first.]
;B[ge]LB[ie:a][nc:b][hf:c]C[<tomjk>
Now I cannot play anymore (a) to have Black respond locally and then take (b). So it looks to me now that my move at F15 was not good.

Erik: (a) or (c) is better for black, to avoid bad shape.];W[ef]
;B[fd];W[ed]C[<tomjk>
White is alive and Black without eyes. But also the White J16 group is not so strong ...]
;B[ie];W[je];B[jf]
(;W[kf]C[<tomjk>
Better at (a) to protect for the cut and for shape - see variation

Erik: Yes, it seems the cut works well for black, but it's very difficult to read out during the game...]
;B[jd];W[ke];B[jc]
(;W[hb]C[<tomjk>
White threatens to connect or to capture the Black group K16.

Erik: Doesn't really work though... (see variation)]
(;B[lc];W[gb];B[nd]C[<tomjk>
Now White should be able to capture the Black G15 group, but I miss my chance ... :(

Erik: This looks good for white now. That group should be a big burden for black during the rest of the game.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[rf];B[re];W[jg]LB[kh:A][jh:B]C[Erik: Too small scale. Capturing at a large scale makes it much more costly for black to sacrifice the group. (A) or (B) looks better.]
;B[gh]C[<tomjk>
I think Black plays too far and now White can capture Black or attack it severely, but ...

Erik: It may also be blacks intention to sacrifice the group in order to get a position on the outside.]

(;W[fb]SQ[ge][he][hd][ie]LB[gh:a][gf:b]C[<tomjk>
White makes a stupid move - no need to play here now!
 It was my wishful thinking that Black would try to save its stones (marked with circles) by connecting and then the Black group has just the right number of liberties left to be captured immediately. ;-)

If White at (a) White would take a big lead in the game by capturing the whole Black group or chase it across the board making territory at the left side on the 8th line - see variation.

The stone at (a) does not assure a connection to the stones marked with squares.

Erik:
Yes, since the white groups were connected anyway, the move is a waste.]
;B[ig];W[if];B[hf];W[ih];B[hg]
(;W[kh]LB[ii:A]C[Erik: I don't like this connection, black is the weakest here, so you should not be so afraid of the cut. (A) is enough protection and it puts more pressure on blacks group.]
;B[gj];W[ei]LB[ai:a][bh:b][fi:c][gl:d]C[<tomjk>
Now White has to play on the fifth line - a success for Black.
Also Black can aim at later playing the "monkey jump" at (a) or simply at (b) to reduce White's territory considerably.

Erik:  If  you want to protect the side, try (c) instead to get sente. The black group is still weak, so you should try to continue the pressure. (d) is a very good point for both now.]
;B[gl];W[kq]LB[qn:a][np:b][nq:c]C[<tomjk>
I thought it was time to reduce any possibile big moyo for Black on the bottom.
I did not want to play at (a) provoking Black at (b) or (c) and making an invasion difficult here...

Erik:
Good move.];B[mq];W[hq];B[gq];W[ho]LB[hp:a]C[<tomjk>
(a) looked too narrow for White, also this move threatens to cut off the upper group.

Erik:
I agree.];B[fn]LB[gm:a][fm:b][fl:c]C[<tomjk>
Black is still not connected (W (a), B (b), W (c)) ... Black cannot capture (a), because the ladder favours White.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[dp]LB[bq:A]C[Erik: Black might answer (A) here to start a complicated fight.]
;B[eq];W[eo];B[fo];W[qn]LB[bq:a][ip:b]C[<tomjk>
(a) is very big, but it is gote for me, so I decided that playing here which looked more urgent to me in this stage of the game ...

Erik: (a) is very big, but endgame. You should, however, be careful about the weak group on the lower side. (b) is a weak point.]
;B[qo]LB[ql:A][qp:B]C[
Erik: (A) or (B) is better for Black];W[pn]TR[qj]LB[of:a][pf:b]
C[<tomjk>
Very good for White. The marked stone is just at the right spot.

If White gets to play at (a) later, he gets a big territory.]
;B[ro]LB[oe:A]C[Erik: Black takes gote! Now you have a chance to take a big chunk of territory starting with e.g. (A)]
;W[rn];B[nf]C[<tomjk>
Black must have read White's thoughts ;-)];W[og]LB[nh:a]C[<tomjk>
Probably better at (a), since the actual move brings my still eyeless center group into danger ... on the other hand I have friends waiting on the bottom, so I don't worry too much and try to take some profit on the side.

Erik:  Yes, you should try to keep the connection with L12, so (a) is probably better.

<tomjk>
Note:
This is a good example how I often leave my weak groups "abandoned" for a long time .... any suggestions how to learn to avoid this?

Erik:  I have three answers to this question:

Don't leave two weak groups on the board. In this case you have two weakish groups which black can use to launch splitting attacks. If you have strong positions elsewhere one weak group is often not so bad.

This is a matter of whole board thinking. A weak group is very dependent on positions elsewhere on the board, so you must always have this group in mind wherever you are playing. In this case this groups wasn't really weak before, so the answer is maybe: Do not make it weak!

It's also a matter of reading to determine how weak the group is. Can it make two eyes? Can it run away? Can I use the opponents weak groups to save my group? If you can answer these questions it's much easier to know how careful you need to be. Solving tesuji and life&death problems is a good help here.]
;B[ng];W[nh]TR[og]LB[oh:a][mh:b]C[<tomjk>
This now leads to heavy fighting on the side ... in the end Black lives on the side and my territory there is wasted. Fortunately I get territory in the center in exchange.

Playing at (a) here, would have surely avoided all the fighting, but I tried to make with this move also an attempt to help my group in the center ...

My thoughts now, analysing the game:
If I go back two moves, than having played the previous White move at the point where I played now, I surely would have not played the stone marked with the triangle where it sits now, by at (a) or (b).
This shows that in the first place the triangled strone was not correctly played.

Erik:
Yes, I agree. You can't both get territory on the side and keep the connection with L12, so you must first secure the weak group.]
;B[oh]C[<tomjk>
... to be expected ...];W[pg]LB[ni:a][mh:b]C[<tomjk>
I thought to capture the black stone and also save my stones at R14.

Probably better to pull down at (a) to avoid Black (b)?

Erik:
Yes, I think so.];B[mh];W[ni];B[mi]LB[nj:a][hi:b]C[<tomjk>
Now I faced the decision to do something for the White group in the center which was getting weaker and weaker.
If Black captures this group the game is over for White ...

Therefore I could not play at (a) and I had to  try to make eye-space for my center group, even if I knew tthat Black would get (a), then press me down and reduce my potential territory to a few points ...

Erik: Difficult. But since white has (b) in sente you might be able to play (a), but the situation is not good either way...]
;W[lg]C[<tomjk>
Trying to make eye-shape ... and threatening the cut at N13.]
;B[nj];W[oi];B[oj];W[pi]C[<tomjk>
Ouch, that was painful!];B[ji]C[<tomjk>
The expected attack ...

I was not sure if to connect here, but then I figured that  if I  connected I would still get no eyes here.

I also was aware that  the Black  N11 and O10 groups are still weak and that I had the cuts at N13 and O15 to help me to live or get out.]
;W[me]LB[lj:A]C[Erik: Not really sente, since black can answer at (A)  instead.]
;B[ne];W[ki];B[jh]LB[jj:a][ii:b][ij:c][hi:d][lj:e]C[<tomjk>
White says "thank you", as I get now (a) and (c) for free and then (e) to get out into the open.

Erik:
You are lucky :)];W[jj];B[ii];W[ij];B[hi]
(;W[lj]C[<tomjk>
I think now that I could have cut here directly, since White is  strong now in the center ... see variation

This another typical error of me. I can not evaluate exactly the relative strenght of groups. To me in the game the White group still needed help and I was not aware that it was actually much stronger than the N11 and O10 groups if I keep them separated

Erik:
If you could evaluate evaluate exactly the relative strenght of groups you would have been pro by now ;)
In this case, it's a matter of reading. You have read out the variation -- if you cut and it fails, the game is lost.]
;B[mj];W[mg]C[<tomjk>
White is out of trouble for the time being

Now Black has to look after its group O10. In the ensuing fight the white territory on the right gets devasted, but I (White) get some compensation in the center ...]

;W[ll];B[pl];W[oo]LB[ql:a]C[<tomjk>
A big error, as Black now not only gets connected, but also captures the white R6 group - I was not reading accurately ... :(

I guess a move at (a) is called for now ...];B[po];W[pm]LB[ql:a]
C[<tomjk>
White looses just a liberty and accomplished nothing. Better at (a) I think.

Erik:  Well, you have to give up one of the groups...];B[ol]
;W[mo]C[<tomjk>
Still possible to play (a), but then Black gets the white O5 group.
I choose to save  the white O5 group to get points in the center now. I also hope to reduce Black's corner later.

Allowing Black to capture the O5 group seems too good to allow.]
;B[rm];W[ql];B[qm];W[rl];B[sn]C[<tomjk>
This is a major desaster for White.
Now White is behind ... it is difficult to imagine that White can win this game anymore ...]
;W[hm]LB[lp:a][nq:b]SQ[mm][mn]C[<tomjk>
I am trying to fence off some territory, but because of the presence of the marked Black stones Black has still a severe move at (a).
White can counterattack at (b), but it is not easy for White to get much territory in the center after Black (a).]

I don't know if Black could have been killed. It was not my plan to kill the group.

Erik: No, black had no problems to get two eyes.

Looking at the board *now* I see the remaining big points are (a) through (d).

(a) and (b) are sente for me, and (c) looks bigger than (d), but I am not completely sure.

During the game I missed to see these details ...
I realized during the game that on the top there semed to be some possibility for White to reduce Black's territory, but I had no idea where to play really severe.

Do you have any suggestions?

Erik:  (b) is double sente, so I think it's more important.
(c) and (d) are about the same size, but blacks sente, so you can get at most one of them.

Not that black (e) can cause some trouble.   And yes, there are some aji on the top, see variation.

You played very well in the endgame and, with assistance of black, got all the big endgame points.]

(;W[oq];B[pq];W[pr];B[qr]C[Erik: White can use the J3 aji to gain some points in sente here.]

(;W[bg]LB[ag:a][ah:b][af:c][bh:d][bd:e][bq:f][sf:g]C[<tomjk>
It is not so big to save the Q2 stone now and for Black it is gote to capture Q2, so I play at B13 which is gote, but prevents the "monkey jump" from  Black and is worth about 5 points.

If now Black pushes with (a) to (e), White will get sente and can play (f) which is worth 10 points +

Erik:
Black can't play (a), see variation. But black should take sente at (g) or (f) now. (g) is double sente and therefore very big.]

I tried to find sente moves and to reduce the top Black territory ... I was aware of the big moves at (a) and (b), but they are gote ...

Erik:

This is aji-keshi, i.e., it destroys all potential to do something nasty there.

(b) is not so big, it's blacks privilege to play (c) and (b) in sente.

(d) first, then (e) and (a)];B[mc];W[jb]C[Erik: Black should try not to respond to every move...]

;B[sd];W[sf];B[rc]LB[pe:a][qd:b][rd:c][bq:d]C[<tomjk>
I realize during the game that this is an error by Black: after White (a), Black has to be careful with the possible cut at (b) later.   So Black should play (c) to seal off his territory.

Erik: Yes, (b) would be better, or perhaps (d)];W[bq]C[<tomjk>
White gets also this big point.
This part of the game went exceptionally well for White who got nearly all the big points with the result that White seems to be slightly ahead now ...

C[Erik: This pattern is a very common joseki. But once again (A) is not well positioned, white needs another move to remove the aji of (D). But neither (B) or (C) work very well with (A), so it's a difficult situation.]

(;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed]LB[gd:a][lc:b][cg:c][cj:d][ic:e]C[It seems to me that playing like this is not so good for White.

Black seems to be alive in the corner and can play now the splitting attack at (a) and if White defends at (b) Black can attack at around (c) aiming to play at (d) later.

 What do you think of this reasoning?

Erik:   Here you see that (e) is bad, since it has little connection with whites last move.]
;AW[hc]AE[ic];B[fb];W[ge]LB[hc:A][ic:B][dj:C]C[Erik: This is a common joseki. You see that (A) works much better than (B) together with the rest of the stones.

But, of course, black can still play (C)...]))
(;W[id]LB[dl:A]C[Erik: This move might give you a big wall (if black jump into the corner), but the probelm is that (A) is a big too far away, so black might be able to invade.]

(;B[ec];W[fd];B[gd];W[ge];B[he];W[hd];B[gc];W[gf]LB[dj:A]C[Erik: Still black can play around (A) and ruin much of whites moyo.]

(;B[cp];W[do];B[hp];W[pd]C[Erik:
Black can play this variation to get a large corner, but since one corner is still empty,  blacks move in the game is good too.]

(;W[pd];B[co]LB[jq:a][jd:b][jp:c][ci:d][pj:e]C[<tomjk>
Now I think I need to play (a). Even if I play (b), which looks big for White, Black gets the even bigger point at (c) aiming to play at (d) or (e) then.

If I play at (a) Black can play either (d) or (b) or approach the white stones directly.

Do you have any suggestion what would be the best course here for White? Is (a) the most urgent point to play now?

Erik: Yes, around (a) is the biggest move in this position, since the black shimari is looking in this direction. This is a normal opening, but the game move is good too.]
