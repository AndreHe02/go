C[++++First I want to thank you for spending your time for a review of this game. It is an important game for me because it shows how I create an advantage in the opening and loose it during the rest of the game (or maybe having an advantage was a daydream?). I sure made some silly local mistakes, but how could I have played better on a grand scale? At some moves, I am really not able to decide what to do...     Please have a look at the first 60 moves, an analysis of the opening and the early middle game is more important for me than the rest of the game. But if you have the time, I would appreciate it if you add some comments for the other moves, too.     I hope you can give me some advices. I added some notes, too.     Thanks again, Joerg.]

(;W[ck]C[He plays the low version. Interesting.          Hello !     I observe a lot of professionnal and strong amateur games and I never saw this opening.      I think that 6 would be better in N16 for example or C5]
;B[jd];W[nq]
(;B[jp]C[why not, but it's difficult for the following. I prefer M3 or Q6 (maybe more simple).]
;W[qn]C[lively move];B[np]C[Is this the right direction? Which move would you play?     It seems correct. However, 5 would be better in R10. May be 9 in M3 better in this position because white has many possibilities on the both sides !?]
;W[mp];B[no]
(;W[oq]
(;B[po]C[Its not joseki.     According to the Ishida's dictionnary of basic joseki, the move must be in Q3]
;W[mo]
(;B[pq]C[I am not sure, if this is joseki.     Now, this move is not sente. White can always stabilize his stone with R9 and S4 at the right side. 16 is a good move to fight in the center and seal the 9 stone from the black group. Play immediatly in C5 (see varation 6)]
;W[pl]
(;B[fc]C[Which move do you suggest? Maybe at the bottom?     Its is not sente.18 white's move has to be answered]
;W[hp]
(;B[lq]C[Why ? Useless. Too soon. You make a weak group. White is happy to connect.]
;W[mq];B[kn]
(;W[ln];B[km];W[nn];B[pe]
(;W[fe];B[hd];W[ld];B[me]C[I had no other idea. What do you think?     I think the exchange 28 for 29 and then 30 is not good for white because he is reinforcing black then invading. His target is 9-21-23-25 group and Black is happy to play 31. He has a chance to make a big moyo in the center.]
;W[ke];B[lg];W[jf];B[ek]C[I am trying to prevent a big white moyo     C5 or C6 is better. E9 and H14 are miai]
;W[db]
(;B[kd]C[Why ? He will answer in N15 and now 31 is not at the good place. Play D11 or D5]
;W[le];B[lc];W[md];B[mc]C[connecting     Too small. 31 and 33 become whitout meaning]

<<<<<<< End of the comment >>>>>>>>];B[cl];W[rp]C[now he shows me, that my group is not safe at all, but I will be lucky and safe it.     Thank you for reviewing the first 60 moves. I think your comments will help me. If you have the time, please have a quick look at the rest of the game.     Bye, Joerg.]
