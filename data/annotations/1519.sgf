C[hi! i'm Martin (therefore starting my comments with 'M:') and
i hope you will find my remarks usefull :-)];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp]
C[3-4 is too slow after white's 4-4
M: no. don't worry! any 3-4, 3-5 or 4-5 in a empty corner would
be possible.];W[dp];B[oc];W[qj];B[ql]LB[qh:A]C[M: this move is ok. but many players would prefer to approach
from the other side (with A), because an extension in front of
a shimari is always valuable (even if it is *only* a 3 point
jump).];W[qg];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[hq]C[M: this invasion is too early (not well prepared). it would be
better for white eigther to have one more stone in the corner
(maybe D3) or a stone around N4 before making this invasion.]

(;B[fo]C[g4?
M: yes i think G4 is better (see variation), but F5 is also possible.]
;W[ho];B[fm];W[dl];B[ip]C[maybe h8 is better
M: this move is not good. it forces white to connect. but that
is helping white, because it removes a weakness. on the other
hand, it does not really help black. this is a socalled 'thank-you-move'.
some kind of capping move (like H7 or H8) would be better.]
;W[hp];B[hm]C[again maybe h8 better
M: i think both (H7 and H8) are possible. I know many players
are afraid of the double-peep at G6. but don't worry. cutting
here would hurt white more than black.];W[gn];B[fn];W[gm]
(;B[fk]C[M: no! black must fight back and play G8. see variartion.]
;W[gl];B[fl];W[im];B[jn];W[hl];B[in]C[forcing the capture
M: no mistake but no big gain eighther. maybe aji-keshi.];W[hn]
;B[fc]C[M: big! but the fighting on the lower left is not over yet. i
think i'd rather play something like H10.];W[df];B[jd];W[qq]
C[not good in this moment
M: yes, this will help black more than white.]
(;B[qp]C[M: this is the wrong direction.
White will get the corner, black will get a nice wall. That's
OK for black, but the stone R8 ist too close to this wall. The
black stones around K4 would work much nicer with such a wall
(see variation)!];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rp]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[qn]C[M: The moves in the corner have be correct (joseki). Can you
see now how close R8 is?];W[dj]C[M: big!];B[gi]C[to scape
M: yes. G10 may be a little better, because there is some weakness
in the keima connetion. but G11 is also playable.];W[gj];B[fj]
;W[hj];B[ei]C[because this group is too weak
M: yes. necessary.];W[di]C[M: white has made nice profit on the left side, black is still
not setteled and the white group on the other side is stronger
than before. good attack. success for white.];B[oj]C[trying yo make a moyo whilw attach 6 and 8
M: attacking the white stones on the right side is a good idea!
but what are you going to do if white answers with Q9? I think
P9 would be the better point.];W[pe]C[M: not so good.];B[md]
C[maybe o15 better
M: yes. maybe even O14.];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[rd];W[re];B[jm]
C[continuing with the moyo
M: if you want to make territory on the lower right you should
(1.) remove the weakness at Q9 (maybe play R9 which threatens
to attack the white group with a follow up like R11 or S11).
White should answer this move. (2.) you should play L8. this
is much better shape than 61. K8 is to good to let white have
it.];W[jl];B[kl];W[jk];B[kk];W[pk]C[M: there it is.];B[pl];W[ok]
;B[ol];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[ml]C[M: black has made a territory on the lower right, but white has
a little more territory (maybe 5 points more). with a move in
low or upper left corner white could extend his territorial advantage
to 10 - 15 points.  but the main problem is: black has a weak
group on the left side! and all white groups are save!];W[kj]
C[M: this move has no function. it does not defend (white is already
save), it does not attack, it makes no territory.];B[nf]C[threating to save 53
M: this idea is ok! especially if you plan to play F15 later.
this two moves would expand your position on the upper side.
but i would play D2 (and some follow-up moves; just as long as
it is sente) first. this would (1) strenghen the weak black group
and (2) reduce white's corner.];W[nh];B[og];W[oh];B[fg]C[M: yes, the black group is weak. i understand that you want to
play there. but unfortunately white gets now a chance to reduce
the black territory on the upper side.];W[hc]C[M: F15 would be better. black has to take care about his weak
group and white could attack then stronger.];B[gd]C[M: ok. but i don't think that it is possible to kill white.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[id];B[jb];W[ic];B[je];W[ib];B[kb];W[ie];B[ig]
C[k13 better?
M: yes, i think so. but the poblem is that you don't want to
push white to the left. the black groups are not completely connected
and a cut here would be a desaster.];W[if];B[hg]C[k14 better?
M: if your own group would be setteled, i'd say yes. but if you
force white to turn left, you would hurt yourself even more.
i'm afraid you have to let white go.];W[jf];B[jg];W[kf];B[ke]
C[M: bad shape. better M15.];W[le];B[kd];W[lg]C[he's scape
M: yes. could not be helped, because black on the lower left
was too weak. now white is leading 15 - 20 points.];B[mf];W[lf]
;B[cc]C[M: good!];W[dc];B[cb]C[M: D18 would be joseki.];W[cd]
;B[db];W[bd]C[M: white has invaded the upper side, but the invasion was not
well prepared. so he lost the corner to black in return. very
big for black! but still white is leading more than 10 points.]
;B[ki]C[M: what is the meaning of this move? D2 (maybe even C3) would
be big.];W[jj]C[M: not necessary.];B[mh]C[M: i don't think that black can cut.]
;W[mg];B[ng];W[lh];B[mi]C[bad. this stone is dead
M: yes.];W[li];B[ni];W[pi];B[ph];W[oi];B[qi];W[pj];B[pg];W[qh]
;B[ri]C[nonsense, but maybe they will have aji later, and is sente
M: ok!];W[rj];B[rh]C[M: now you are removing the aji, that you just created.]
;W[rg]C[M: without the exchange 127-128, S9 would be sente-endgame for
black, now it is not sente anymore.];B[dh]C[M. ok!];W[ch];B[dg]
;W[cg];B[dq]C[M: playing in the corner is big! D2 (C3 ?) is even bigger.]
;W[cq];B[dr];W[cr];B[do];W[co];B[ep];W[cp];B[dm];W[cm];B[dn]
C[M: too small and gote.];W[eb]C[M: white can not cut.];B[ec]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[gc];B[fa];W[fd];B[ea];W[ge];B[ed];W[fe];B[ee]
C[so little
M: yes. it is not the biggest.];W[eg];B[eh];W[ef];B[de]C[so little
M: but sente! as long as white has to answer you can still play
the big move. sente is very impotant.];W[ce];B[ff];W[cf];B[rk]
;W[si]C[M: not necessary. if white want's to play there, better M9 or
T9.];B[jr]C[M: good!];W[hr]C[M: no! better N2 or M1.];B[mr]
C[M: good.];W[rs]C[M: a little over-cautious.];B[ns];W[ps];B[el]
;W[dk];B[ji]C[M: C1, G2 or B17 would be bigger.];W[ii];B[ih]
C[M: L13 is better shape.];W[hi];B[hh];W[me];B[ne];W[ld];B[mc]
;W[lc];B[lb];W[mj]C[M: M9 is much bigger!];B[gf];W[he];B[gr]
C[M: good.];W[gs];B[fs];W[hs];B[bc]C[M: good.];W[ad];B[ac];W[rc]

;W[gp];B[fp];W[tt];B[qr];W[rr]C[M: Interessting game! Black's main problem was the group on the
lower left. It was unsetteled for so long! White's attack with
46 was good, but he made a lot of bad prepared invasions (H3,
R3, H17). He got way with H3. Because R4 was the wrong direction,
R3 ended 50/50. Black punished H17 by taking away the corner.
Black's endgame was better, but white was allready to far ahead.]

miai; also C and D are miai), but is very small and has lost
