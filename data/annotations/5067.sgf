C[JC: Hey, this is Jewdan. I will begin all of my comments with "JC:" for the sake of readability. I am honestly a little timid regarding reviewing your game for you as I have been losing all my games lately, but I think I can still help you. I'll give it a whirl! ^_^]

kaktus [16k\]: hi];W[dp]C[kaktus [16k\]: have fun ^^

;B[ic];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg]C[this joseki ok?

JC: A little odd to ask on your opponent's move :P

Yeah, it's fine; you know what you want: that large, juicy area between Q16 and J15. This joseki is the best way to make sure you get it. Be warned, though; according to Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, this is a defensive maneuver; you probably don't want to play this way when you're behind. Not that you are.]
;B[of]
(;W[rd]C[opponent doesn't follow  the  joseki? any chance to take advantage?

JC: You played it fine. I've added the joseki that gets the most similar result for you to see how White lost out with this sequence.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[qg];W[rf];B[qh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe]C[?

JC: This is fine.

Let's compare the results here with the joseki. Black still has his guaranteed 23 moku along the top. White still has about 18.5 moku, but he is completely trapped in the upper-right corner. On top of that, the White stone at Q13 makes for a nice trophy for a sequence well-played. The only reason this sequence isn't completely horrible for White is that he now has sente.]
;W[qn]C[JC: This move just feels wrong. Black is so strong in the upper-right that its strength bleeds down in the lower-right. O3 feels like the honest move here.]
;B[qk]C[pincer should be r8?

JC: I may be wrong, but this feels well-balanced to me. It's the proper distance from your group at R12. The only downside is that this is not considered joseki. However, after looking at the sequences shown in Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, I feel you should turn out all right, no matter what White plays.]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[rl];B[rk]C[JC: This is not such a good move. White has decided to settle himself on the side before leaping out; this is not good. The best way to punish this is to play higher on the board, where opening game moves should be played. Three moves I am considering under these circumstances are Q7, P8, and P6 (in that order).

You might be wondering why this move is bad when you got such a good result. The reason is that it gave White the chance to correct his poor play by jumping out to P6, where he probably should have played instead of S4. Just because he didn't make this correction doesn't make your move good.]
;W[ql];B[pl];W[pm];B[ol];W[om];B[nl];W[nm];B[mp]C[suggestions?

JC: This seems good to me, save for the aji of White O3/P3. Once White escapes (it is inevitable, but you profited well), he should aim for L3 at some point to make an invasion of this area feasible. Just be sure to play solidly.]
;W[oo]C[JC: Aji-keshi. Say, "Thank you."];B[op];W[no]
(;B[jp]C[JC: This move is unnecessary; go straight to F3.];W[gq]
C[JC: Now White is undercutting your territory under K4.];B[cn]
C[c6 ok? or is there a better or a more urgent move?

JC: I think it's the best move right now.];W[co]C[JC: White is too far behind to play passively like this! The C8 pincer is required.]
;B[dn];W[ep]C[JC: White cannot afford to let Black take C10 like this! Regardless of the consequences, White must take the chance and play it first.]
;B[cj];W[ch];B[ei];W[jh]C[how to handle k12? a good move by my opponent? I find it a little strange...

JC: This is a desperate move. It tries to reduce all of Black's influence in the center at once, but it is also an easy target for attack. Black's territorial lead is such that this he doesn't need the moyo to win at this point; he can attack White lightly without any attempts to kill.]
;B[mm]C[JC: Hmm... I don't see this move as worthwhile, now that K12 has been played first. It doesn't really block off any territory for Black, and White will have no trouble living in the center, anyway. I myself would play L13 to recreate moyos at the top of the board and on the right side.]
;W[mn];B[lm];W[hg];B[ff]C[i played f14 because it can connect to either f17 or e11 (I suppose...)  ok?

JC: I'm confused... E11 is your stone, and I can't figure out what you mean. Anyway, this is a move like I would play without counting, as it is just mean. However, for the past five plays (K12, N7, N6, M7, H13), the score has not changed at all. Play a move that makes a difference before White does! I still like L13.]
;W[fg];B[eg];W[fh];B[eh];W[gf];B[fe];W[ge];B[gd];W[hd];B[hc]
;W[id]C[how to play now?

JC: Hane! K16 is the best move now.]
(;B[if]C[JC: Too aggressive! This is a killing move, and you can't kill this group. You can only hurt yourself by playing moves like this.]

;B[mg];W[mf];B[ng];W[kj];B[oi];W[ni];B[oh];W[lk]C[JC: Let's assess this situation as opposed to if you had haned simply at K16. Your top no longer has 23 guaranteed moku (White has N16). White's center is at least 8 moku. Your right moyo has been demolished. Granted, White is not alive yet, but it won't take much for him to earn that. This is a failure.

Black has about 45 moku here; White has about 42.5 moku. The destruction of your right moyo, the reduction of your top, and the enlarging of White's center has cost you your comfortable lead.]

[ek][cm][cl][ck][bk][dk][dm]MA[ki]C[JC: Thus begins the endgame. I've marked all of Black's definite territory with triangles, White's with circles, and dead stones that occupy points that must be filled with X's. So, the count is:

Black: 52 moku
White: 45.5 moku

Black has a 6.5 moku lead... a comfortable margin, especially when entering the endgame with sente. However, mistakes can turn the score around by even more than the 17 point difference seen between this board and the final result, so I'll comment carefully on where you went wrong.]
;B[bi]C[suggestions until here?];W[bh];B[cq]C[pointless... :maybe better b6?

JC: B6 is sente, but B5 is reverse sente while reducing White another point. It's a tough call, I think I'd take B6, then H2 to widen the gap.]

;W[cb];B[ca];W[bc];B[ah];W[bg];B[rb]C[also pointless...better q18?

---------------------------------------------
Could you enumerate and show my general mistakes, please? Do you have any other comments or general adives how to play? What are my weaknesses?

Thank you very much for your review!!! ^__^

(kaktus 16k)

JC: I hate to say this, but T17 gives you a definite win at this point, thanks to the mother of all ko threats.

Your weaknesses? You seem to play a fairly solid game, but you need to learn to count and read. Counting would have let your territory at the top of the board be thirty-some moku instead of eighteen. Reading would have allowed you to keep the lower-right corner, attack the upper right, and more.

Anyway, I enjoyed doing this review, even the several hours I spent futilely reading sequence after sequence in the lower left corner to make the C3 invasion work.

I hope this helps.
