C[Hello, thank you very much for looking at my game.  I am a 24k on KGS, though I'm new to the system so the rating has been going up consistently.

I was hoping to submit a close game that I lost, but I'm settling for this one because I feel that I played better than I typically do (no dumb mistakes that cost me big groups).  I won by a fair margin, but I'd like to know how I could play more strongly in a couple of areas.  First, I am always clueless when the game reaches a point where the sides and corners are mostly taken and the middle starts being chopped up.  I never know where to start or where to play.  Second, I love to attack corners where my opponent has one stone on the star point, but I usually end up giving him/her a big wall around my small territory.  I manage to escape in this game, but I don't know if that's my credit or my opponent's fault.  I'll make a comment at the move.  Any other advice would be warmly welcomed.

David Britt


Hi.
I'm Michal Piaskowski, I'm about 15kyu.
I'll add some comments to your game.];B[dc];W[pd];B[cp];W[pp]
;B[cf];W[eq]
(;B[dq]C[This move isn't good.
I'd suggest a pincer ta G3];W[ep]
(;B[er]C[This move is very small.
Extending at D6 or D7 would be better and it would strenghten the D3 C4 stones aswell. Right now your botton group is rather week.

In the following moves to G3 white will build a very nice wall using your weeknesses.]
;W[do];B[co];W[fr];B[cr];W[gq]
(;B[dj]C[This is nice but K17 is better.];W[dm]C[Answerring to this move is helping white to build very big and strong wall.
I would suggest ignoring this move and playing somewhere else.]
;B[cm]C[I noticed in your game, that you make a lot of contact moves. It's usually better to avoid such moves.]
;W[dl];B[cl]C[Now white has very strong wall and can expect to biuld huge territory at the bottom]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[Very good now white has to escape to the center.]
;W[ee];B[kd]C[Nice. i would play a little lower at L17, but this is fine.]
;W[nc];B[mc];W[qf];B[nb]C[Small];W[oc];B[ob];W[pb];B[pj]TR[pp]
C[It woould be better to play closer to the tringled stone, to put more presure on it.]
;W[qn]
(;B[oq]LB[lq:A]C[This is aking for trouble, but white is very strong at the bottom, so you had to attack.

But A woudl be better, as it give's you more possible continuations. (see variation)]
;W[mq]C[Now your stone is in trouble.];B[pq];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq]
;B[rr];W[qo]C[This is the move that my opponent makes that seems unecessary.  I imagine it's what allowed me to escape later on, whereas WP4 would have kept me penned in.  Is there a good way to attack the star point without giving my opponent a big wall and tons of influence?


This is a good question. Im my opinion you should attack Q4 one move earlier, by playing Q10 stone closer to it. After white R6 he has strong formation in the corner.]

(;B[om]LB[nl:A]MA[oj][pj]C[I don't like this move. O8 is better. It makes better shape with marked stones. I't will be harder for white to cut those stones off.

Try avoiding contact moves.];W[nl];B[ol];W[ok];B[nn];W[nk];B[nj]

It will strengthen white group, and you won't gain much.

[ib][cc]C[This is the point I mentioned at the beginning where I feel like there are a million moves I could make, but very few surface as the best ones.  I don't really know how to claim territory in the middle.  Since all of my opponent's groups are healthy, I play in a way that seems to get me territory, but doesn't necessarily.  My plays on K7 and G7 net me a couple points in the end, but my opponent snakes through everything else and my main territory ends up being in the E11 and N13 area, where I already had stones.  Was I just being too greedy, or was that actually what one is to expect from the center?

There is'h much you can do int the center at this point. You have some lose stone, that dont make any territory (marked with circle) but you can you thos stone the way you did, to destroy as much white territory as possible. K7 and G7 are very good moves here.

At this point, it's also possible to kill the white group the the top. After black E14 It will has ony one eye, but if you fail to kill it, you might lose a lot.]
