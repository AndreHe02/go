submitting for a

commented on some of
my moves, which now
look like a mistake...];B[dd];W[pp];B[cp];W[pd];B[eq]
(;W[qj];B[dj]C[spuho: In retrospect,
I think W 6 should
have been at D10.
Black's side looks
strong now.
vlkplk: Even you allow
ed black to play this
big move, i think situ
ation is still ballnce
d. But often white pla
ys there to avoid blac
k taking this perfect
extension.]
(;W[jq]C[vlkplk: I would prefer
extension along the u
pper side, since on lo
wer white is approachi
ng black`s strong posi
tion. But it`s big poi
nt, so good move.];B[jc];W[cf];B[ch];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ed]

ontinue, otherwise see
var.]
(;W[gc]C[spuho: a redundant
move?

vlkplk: Not waste move
at all, since it goes
to attack lonely blac
k stone in the upper m
iddle. As well black h
as spend some moves to
build a wall and he d
oesn`t like white goin
g out to center.
Key in this situation
is some move at H15 fo
r black.];B[mc]
(;W[pc]C[spuho: I wanted to
protect the corner...

vlkplk: Why not... But
since stone at S10 is
too far, corner is st
ill attackable. And yo
u can consider some mo
re shape-making and st
ronger moves, see var.];B[hb]C[vlkplk: White doesn`t
need to worry this mov
e, see var.]
(;W[ec]C[vlkplk: not necessary,
because WG17 protects
well...];B[qf];W[qe];B[pf];W[ne]C[vlkplk: Good idea, but
blacks upper side gro
up is already not weak
.];B[qi];W[pi];B[qh];W[pj];B[re];W[rd];B[pe];W[qd];B[od]C[spuho: here's where
the problems begin...]
(;W[oe]C[vlkplk: what else to d
o than cut here! but b
lack has strong back-u
p position on left sid
e, so one should expec
t troubles having a we
ak group like this.
in situation like this
it is good to treat w
eak stones as a sacrif
ice imediately or leav
e the position and sta
rt somewhere else hopi
ng, that as situation
changes, there will be
some use of them.];B[nd];W[nh]C[spuho: hm.. mistake?
vlkplk: the white two
atones are weak,and O1
2 doesn`t connect them
... it seems that cut
was unreasonable...
but in the course of g
ame, the final result
was not so bad.
once you have weak sto
nes, you shall always
give a think what happ
ens if you treat them
as a sacrifice. which
is maybe the best way
of thinking now. don`t
try to escape so hard
ly. even dead stones c
an be used efectively
and if you are lucky,
can revive them later.];B[nf];W[me];B[ng];W[lg];B[mh];W[mg]

ng just three stones,
since both black group

by them seems 90% aliv
