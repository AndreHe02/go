C[appleseeds [9k?\]: hi
apzamp [8k?\] hi

I seem to always come out behind in the opening and have to catch up 
later, but white played a good endgame and won big. I struggle with 
judgment in open space. Any comments on the fuseki especially will be 
appreciated. Thank you!

Beeline:

Hi! Interesting game. I think that in the early opening, Black played a better game than White, but later on the agorophobia (I guess) set in. White played territorially for three corners out of four, but stretched his position a lot,  leaving behind an extremely weak position in the shadow of black influence.

Black's route to victory, then, would be to use his power against white's weakness, converting strength (which white naturally gave black through grabby play) into direct profit. Black played too timidly, however, as if he felt that strong black groups were weaker than white's thin positions. Due to not capitalizing on White's weaknesses, some counterproductive exchanges, and to missing out on some of the biggest plays on the board, Black fell far enough behind to ensure a loss.

As far as 'judgement in open space' goes, I would say that to be sure, the opening has  its nuances. The full combinatoric range of possibilities can be daunting, but fundamental, fuseki boils down mostly to one sentence:

Play urgent moves first, then big moves.

In the opening, urgent moves mostly deal with securing a base for your stones. Otherwise, the opponent will take  the opportunity to remove the base, chase the stones, build influence, and then end with sente to play something now made extra-big by the context of what he builds.

Recognizing a big play in the opening is in good part a matter of recognizing the widest area of the board. There then may be particular questions to deal with the particular point that you choose.

High or low? Far or close? The difference between playing high or low is generally much smaller than the difference between playing in the big area and tenuki, so if you don't really know the answer, be satisfied that you know the right general area to play in, and just extend somehow.

If you then make a mistake because of your ignorance, then great; your opponent is usually kind enough to show you why. If you extend too far, your opponent will eventually plonk a stone down, splitting you up; too close, and a checking extension from the outside makes you feel like you have too little territory. You played too low if your opponent plays from  above, pressing you down and limiting you to small territory, and too high if your opponent plays from below, eroding your territory without adequate compensation.

If you then determine that the mistake was in your judgement (and not in poor reading), then you can start to learn by example about when the different kinds of extension are good.

This is sort of the general philosophy that I take to the opening. I will try to give some more specific considerations in the game.


Don't hang too heavily on the tactics of the more complicated variations. They are mostly there to back up my interpretation of the position.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[de]
(;B[oq]LB[cc:B][dc:A]C[i don't know how to play the 4-6 point, 
so i ignored it for now

B: ok. Shimari is not at all a bad idea anyway, and here, where white's d4 stone would love to make a long approach around p3, it makes sense on other levels, too.

You don't need to know too much joseki: an idea of what one choice asks for is good enough. However, I'll look a little at the variations. Black normally plays into the 6-4 at A or B.

A, as you might expect, is good for emphasis on the top side. B looks more toward undermining white influence on the left.]

(;W[pj]C[B: it's much more usual to play a wedge on the third line, so as to be able make a firm base quickly.]

(;B[pl]C[high vs. low extention?

B: It is common in a wedge play to tenuki until you know which side you want to approach from. In this case, though, I'd prefer to play r13 (or q13) against white immediately. This is because:

1) 4-4 stones want to extend, widely if possible; a lack of grip on the corner is compensated for by ambition outside, and even a kind of short extension (particularly q13) can prepare to make a large extension up top, which is a very open (big) area.

2) a white approach at r14 would almost certainly demand a response. White can't do anything as threatening against your shimari, since it has already claimed the corner, and that is a large part of the shimari's ambition, anyway (particularly for this low, solid kind).

3) similarly, you want to push white toward your stronger stones, to keep the pressure up. Black is stronger on the bottom, so white will be kept weaker if you push him in that direction.

4) you don't want to play too close to strength, yourself; q8, extending off of a two-stone solid position, feels more inefficient than extending off your one-stone corner, building security.

I maybe prefer r13 to q13, because it looks like better balance: usually it is a good idea to put low stones next to high stones to optimally enclose territory. I think that r13 better complements q8 as a follow up, too, since white will be able to get a firm footing on neither the third nor the fourth line.

Between q8 and r8, I like q8 maybe a little better, mostly because I'd feel overconcentrated playing such a low, short extension from the shimari. Some of this is a matter of taste, though, and all the moves mentioned are probably playable for kyu, provided that they know the meaning of their play: how to use it.]
;W[qf]
(;B[mc];W[qc];B[qd]C[i thought that if i went at q17, i would be too concentrated, but the 
game play didn't turn out too well

B: this is absolutely the right side to block on, not just because of overconcentration per se, but because you want to aim at exploiting white's weak group: getting stronger will generally make your attack all the more profitable.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pc];B[od];W[oc];B[nc]LB[nb:C][ob:A]
[pb:B]C[B: This is perfectly legitimate corner play.

The position that you get is in fact joseki. Your group on the top right can't be cut effectively (black may play n15 to insist on connection, for  instance),  white is unequivocably blocked from the top side, and moroever, you have large influence towards white's weak q10 stone on the right. White makes significant corner territory, but you seal white off and prepare to devolop in both directions. You can also force at A, white B, black C later on, and end in sente since a further move could lead to ko.

Of course, if you don't like the position that you got, then that is somewhat reason not to play it. It would have been better to play a shorter extension from your 4-4 stone in that case. The wider extension is more open to the corner invasion, which seems maybe to be to your distaste at the moment.]

(;W[jp]
(;B[cj]C[ i think this should be one line lower at C9];W[cm]
;B[cg];W[cf];B[dg];W[cc]C[B: I prefer black after this move. I think that white's c17 is a bit too focused on the upper corner, and invites a big black extension on  the top. Black has no weak groups anywhere (c7 is slack for keeping pressure on the side group), the bottom left corner formation is still very open, and q10 is a weak stone which white has neglected.

Black's q8 is a little bit short, but it keeps q10 under a lot of pressure.]

(;B[dl]LB[fg:C][gg:B][ej:A]C[B: I cannot overemphasise that this is a bad move. d8 for d7 doesn't gain you much at all, but helps white turn the bottom into big territory. If you feel that your group is weak, I say that it isn't; you have a stable base, white has no looming strength, and  you have many options for making further eyeshape or running out into the center, anyway (for instance, A, C, or B).

If this is to break a ladder, it would have been enormously better to either eliminate all aji by playing around n15, reinforce less directly by extending on top or playing r12, or to tenuki altogether; white can't dream of a direct cut,anyway, since you may always choose to play n15 in response to o16.]
;W[dm];B[el]SQ[di][ei][dj][ej][dk][ek]C[B: you end in gote, and white firms up his corner a great deal. You strengthen a group that faced no white thickness, had a base, and could run into the center (and white has his own weaker stone, too). The two stones point  back onto your own group, so you don't get much useful unfluence, either.

This is why I think that this kind of move should go. You should aim to invade white's corner (since the 4-4 was wide open and white's outside influence would tend to be overconcentrated), not to press from outside.]
;W[pn]C[B: overplay. Creating another weak group cannot be good for white.]
;B[nl]C[B: White just made black stronger towards his first weak group, while adding another...]
;W[pg]C[B: Not good. White still doesn't build a build a secure base with this move. Black can start an attack at r11, or thereabouts.]

(;B[nj]C[B: I don't like this move because of the weakness it leaves at p9. It is like you are trying to play lightly. Light play recognises the weakness of a group and tries to save most of it through a willingness to sacrifice certain parts. Here, you are the one who is strong on the side, so you should not leave behind cutting points, since they give white more flexibility in settling his shape.

You should find a way to gain profit from white's weaknesses instead.]
;W[ql]
(;B[qk]C[B: r7 is maybe better than the game; block on the side that you plan to take (though this mostly only applies to the second line).]
;W[pk];B[qm];W[rl]
(;B[rm]C[B: it is better to play s7 at q7 to try to gain sente to play on the top, I think.]
;W[rk];B[qj];W[pm];B[ol];W[qi];B[ro];W[np]
(;B[oo]C[B: Kind of small. I can understand the impulse to want to connect your group, but right now, it is too slow, particularly when white has no relevant thickness. Maybe counterproductive, too, as long as p8 has great freedom of movement in the center. o13 would be a better direction to connect toward in any event, linking weaker groups and building influence.

A good cue that this is not the best move is also that you invite white to cut in at p4, making the effort of either p3 or p5 come out rather wasted.]
;W[op]
(;B[po]C[B: It is painful to let white get away with q3, which steals your territory and makes his group essentially unassailable. It is better let white connect the stones in gote, I think; your center group is still okay and you could later aim for an invasion/attack around m4]
;W[pq];B[nq];W[mq]
(;B[qq]LB[pr:A]C[B: 'A' might be better.];W[or]
(;B[pr]C[B: It might be good attitude to avoid forcing here right now. You are absolutely safe since you paid to capture the two white stones, and white is also absolutely safe, so you are playing only over small territory at this point in the game. The top is way bigger, for instance, so it is good practice to leave this until later.]
;W[nr]C[B: white gained too much here, I think.]
(;B[cq]C[B: try d3 or e2 instead as corner invasions; it is better to lean toward the wider side, I think, both for living and for points. You may be better off playing g4 directly though.

The top is still very big, though.];W[dq];B[cp]
(;W[co];B[dr];W[er];B[br];W[fq]
(;B[bo]C[i'm not sure this move was necessary

B:  I think it might be more urgent to play the top. See the variation.]
;W[cl]
(;B[ck]C[B: kind of slow. you should seize the opportunity  to play a big extension up top or a big reduction on the bottom.]
;W[em];B[fl]
(;W[id]LB[ec:B][ng:A]C[i had been waching this area the whole time but wasn't 
sure how to approach since the upper right black stones didn't offer 
much support

B: H16  was close enough. It was far enough that white couldn't slide underneath, and close enough that white couldn't easily invade (with you able to play at A to connect and tower over the invader or at B to help make a base for your approach stone if you get into a little trouble.

Certainly the black stones on the top right offer more support by closing white's top right group off than they would if they weren't there. If you regard the top right group as weak, then extending can only help you build a base: the white extension only makes you weaker in this area. Also note that white doesn't really have much strength in the area that you would cause you to need support. The corner group is little more than a living group far to the left. There is plenty of room on the side, so the worst that could happen to you would be a supported checking extension.

Don't avoid playing a big area of the board because you don't know precisely how to play there; to do so is analogous to not defending a group because you are unsure precisely how to.]
;B[fm]C[reduce white and build influence toward center before attempting 
upper side

B: ok, but bear in mind that turning at f7 is going to build influence mostly toward the right, which isn't in the right direction to directly help an invasion of the top.]
;W[fo]LB[ib:A][fd:C][gd:B][gf:D]C[not sure how to proceed

B: A  is a conservative slide. B or maybe C are reasonably safe invasions. You can't do anything really good since white's j16 is in fact a very big, steady move: there's no squeezing water from a rock.

Building from the outside at D may be your best bet here, though. Whatever white does in reply, you'll still be able to slide in under j16, and you start to make a moyo of the center; k7 next would be a good point for reducing and building.]
;B[hc];W[ic]
(;B[ib]TR[ic][id]C[B: you must try to escape  into the center foremost.

You'd be joyous if you played h16 and white h18, so its best to let the second line go for now and decide what to play there based on how efforts to escape fare.

Leaning toward the right unnecessarily will make white turn his two stones into strength, anyway, which will in turn weaken your top right group.]
;W[jb]
(;B[gb]C[B: Again, you should try running first. There is a relevant heuristic: you should always jump out before living directly, since you will then live with a larger group, and therefore a bigger reduction of enemy territory.]
;W[ia];B[hb]
(;W[kc]C[B: not all that good for white; the j19-h18 exchange both reduces black's eye potential and eliminates the prospect of connecting underneath, so white might expect to be able to take a harder line. Holding the ladder is good enough in this case, so white should try to seal black in or chase him out directly.]
;B[ge];W[fc]
(;B[ed]C[B: it is safer to simply protect against a cut at g16 by playing at g16: probably also big, since it gives you much more flexibility in reducing the corner.]
;W[ec];B[dd];W[cd];B[dc]C[B: This is overplay, and not a good forcing move as intended. White can and probably should take the point that black plans to take next, to most strongly punish black's mistake.]

[ej][fj][dk][ek][fk]C[this move took a lot of time but 
still doesn't seem to do much other than connect- how to make more 
efficient?

B: This looks like the honest and best reply to me. You also start to claim some of the center; the marked points will now probably all end up yours, and you build influence toward the rest. The marked stones can easily become weak when you strengthen your group in the top right, too.

You shouldn't expect your connection to work extremely hard, anyway;  you are lucky to escape with your invasion and connect in good shape.

The one space jump is natural for defending when moving toward the center. Anything thinner in this case would just help white get good forcing moves in.]
;W[ig];B[nb]C[B: it would have been better to play this forcing exchange earlier. Black is weak enough that white can try to get a good forcing move on the outside, weakening black further.]

(;W[ob];B[me]TR[ig]C[B: Good idea, especially since white got the marked stone in. You might try some nearby points, with an aim more toward connecting, but strong and solid is rarely a terrible idea.]
