C[Hi, thanks in advance for your review! Please review only for Black, of course, if you want to point out something for White - just feel free. I have detailed questions for you, but if you see something obvious or a bad habit in my game, please tell me.

-Svante-: Hello, I am your reviewer.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp]
;B[ec];W[ci]
(;B[ep]C[-Svante-: I would be reluctant to play this kakari, because White is comparatively strong here.  I think that a low and/or far kakari would be better.]
;W[hp]C[-Svante-:  A quite natural pincer in this situation.]

(;B[cn]TR[ci]C[rs220675: Here I was without any clue which joseki would be good for White, since the marked stone certainly would not make any joseki good for black. So, can you show me some sequences for black here?

-Svante-: This move certainly is not right.  White is already stronger in this area, and Black should not create more weaknesses for himself.  White can just play the natural separation move, and all his stones work nicely together to pressure the two separate black groups.
The variations show some standard moves.];W[do];B[ck];W[eo]
;B[cg];W[ei]
(;B[di]TR[ck][cn]C[rs220675: I wanted to connect my groups as soon as possible, since I felt the danger of having a weak group with my marked stones. Did I make a mistake and just running with White to the center would have been better?

-Svante-: Connecting under on the second line while giving the opponent a ponnuki should be regarded as a measure for extreme situations.  Going to the centre is more natural.  If you want to use White's weakness here, I think that you should start with the second line attachment (see variations).]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[dh];B[bi]C[-Svante-: And now, White can still separate through a ko, plus, he has sente.]
;W[qf];B[nd]
(;W[lc]C[-Svante-:  This is a bit overactive.  White has no need to panic.  See variation.]
;B[jc];W[le];B[je]C[-Svante-: This is nice for Black.  White didn't achieve much in the upper right, but Black makes a framework.]
;W[rd];B[og]C[-Svante-: Good.];W[lg]C[rs220675: Is Black's approach in the top right corner alright, or should Black have played more solid? I felt comfortable that my black stones are flexible enough to survive and create pressure on at least one white weak group, so I even played elsewhere in the next move.

-Svante-:  I think that White has thrown away a promising position by playing overly "aggressively".  However, the white group on the right is not too weak, since it has miai of corner and side.  The white group on the upper side is weaker, but it has at least some help from the ponnuki on the left and the high stones on the lower side.  What worries me here is a white move at Q12, and I think that I would play here myself.]

(;B[nq];W[lq];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq]
;B[qn]
(;W[ql]C[-Svante-:  I think it would be more consistent for White to expand his moyo.]
;B[qm];W[pl]
(;B[mf];W[lf]
(;B[qi]TR[pl][ql]C[rs220675: With that move I wanted to generate more pressure on the marked stones. Later in the game white took this stones and lived big there, so was maybe already this move bad? Where would you have played?

-Svante-: I would not regard the marked stones as weak.  Black cannot cut without being cut himself, and White is quite strong on the lower side, so that a new black group would be under much pressure here.  The important thing to do is to stabilize the black group in the top right.  I think that I would not have played the peep before (see variation there).  However, the main problem is that you are presenting a glaring weakness where you are neither strong nor willing to sacrifice too much.]
;W[qc]
(;B[on]C[-Svante-: I think that this is premature.  As said before, White is quite strong on the lower side.  Additionally, Black is weak in the top right now.]
;W[oi]C[-Svante-:  Again, Black has more problems than White.]
;B[ni];W[oj];B[nj];W[ok];B[nh];W[pn];B[lj];W[jg]
(;B[nl]C[rs220675: This move was bad since I was cut.

-Svante-: Yes, it only "looks good".  I think that I would play R13, which is not only big territorially, but also seeks eye space.]
;W[nk];B[mk];W[ml]
(;B[nm]C[-Svante-:  I think that this is asking too much.  Black can sacrifice with good shape.]
;W[lk];B[mj];W[pm]
(;B[kn]C[-Svante-:  Black's position is burning in too many places.  You can now sacrifice even more cleanly than before.]

;W[md];B[kd];W[me];B[mc];W[nb];B[mb];W[ma]TR[md][le][me][lf]
[jg][lg][kh][ki]C[rs220675: Can one catch whites marked stones or can they escape resp. does white have too many chances to go for a kill from blacks point of view? How should black play here?

-Svante-:  Do you need to catch them?  Keep in mind that White's lower left corner stones are very weak now, so the overall situation is not desperate for Black.  What Black has to do now is save his centre stones.  He should be able to use the marked white stones' weakness to achieve that.  You can also keep an eye out for an opportunity to kill, but don't bet the game on it.]

(;B[hi];W[hg]
(;B[ih];W[ig];B[ik]C[-Svante-:  The last two moves look like H11 might not have been the right shape, but I think that H11 is actually OK.  See variations to move 115.]

-Svante-:  Black's main problem was moves like C6, R11, and L6.  In the face of white strength, it is not prudent to create more own weaknesses.

It is important to have realistic expectations.  When your stones are in bad shape or outnumbered,  it is not realistic to expect to destroy any hope of territory for the opponent.  The trick in Go is (at least sometimes) to give the opponent his territory exactly where he wants it.]
