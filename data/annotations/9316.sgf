C[Hi! Thanks by advance for reviewing my game. It's the first time I submit to GTL ! :)

I am white (10k KGS). Black (11k) was playing with a 0.5-komi handicap, and I eventually won by 0.5 points.

After reviewing my game I feel like that I made a big mistake on moves 23-24 and that I was able to catch up only because black played many bad moves in the early yose. However, I am sure from other 10k players' game reviews that I have made a lot of other errors. xD I have added a few comments and questions throughout the game.

;W[nc]C[Timm:
I thought about this move for about 1min30 during the game but I don't think it is very good, and I still can't figure out a good invasion plan.]
;B[lc]
(;W[qc]C[Timm:
Here I felt happy to be able to force black to become thick towards the top edge rather than the right one, which looked bigger (see variation up to move 20).


****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Well invasions certainly are very debatible, it depends on the player's style. My advice is that either O17 or R14 are both excellent moves for invading, however I would have played R14 instead of R17 becouse it will give Black early thickness which in that position is better for him.

My advice on invading is that one should play lightly, sacfrice stone if you must and try not to settle too early becouse settling too early is better for your opponent as he will build thickness.]

I knew this black move was kind of a mistake.

[nd:c][qe:15]TR[pe][pf]C[Timm:
This is the result I expected after black's 15. But although "a" is the first move I thought of, I somehow got confused and thought that Bb would force Wc (when it's an auto-atari...) and gave up the idea of fighting.

Thus I tried to make life for my three stones in the corner.

As a result, I lived very small and then struggled to escape with the marked stones. Black eventually made a lot of territory on the top and right sides.

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Well "a" is the only move, and now the 2 stones on the side are dead. Black would be completely lost here.]

(;W[rd];B[rg];W[pa];B[ob]
(;W[sb]LB[qa:f][ra:f]TR[qe][re][rg]C[Timm:
Here I thought I was alive, and black too. It is only on move 88 that I noticed that "f" was a false-eye and fixed the shape.

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Fortunately Black didn't see it, although the Black group could be in jeopardy if he pushes the corner too much.]
;B[qf];W[pg];B[nd];W[nf];B[ne];W[nh];B[fc];W[me]SQ[of]C[this is a very important concept to understand in go, when to use the aji. playing N15 right now is aji keshi ( it means to blow your aji). N15 isn't a bad forceful move, it's just out of time, you could save it up for later.

Afer Black plays N16, now he can push at P14 without fear of atari.]
;B[md]
(;W[pi]TR[qe][re][qf][rg]C[Timm: Is this any good ?


****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Hard to say, but have this in mind: the White group is completely fine becouse he can run to the center, whereas the Black group is very low and it isn't alive, so it can be attacked. I would have played R11 or R12 and make him crawl for life.]

[pk]C[Timm:
Intuitively I was expecting "b" as a response to "a". Though neither of us noticed it during the game, now c-d-e captures the marked stones by threatening to kill the group on the right (at least I think, see variation).

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

yes, c is very bad for Black]

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

I think it's a good move, threatening B8. It's a kind of move that I would play]

LB[gh:c][ei:a][bj:f][dj:b][mk:d][mn:e]C[Timm:
I think that answering the atari was quite big and that I should have done it.

With this move I intended to avoid e.g. Ba-Wb-Bc but I think there are more important places e.g. "d", "e" or "f". The area around "c" doesn't seem very important altogether.

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

yes the atari was too big to avoid, it can lead to a ko that would be bad for White]

I'd recommend reading some examples of aji and aji keshi, I garantee you will improve if you master the concept (although its hard to "master" it). I read a little of this principle in "Lessons in the Fundamentals of go" by Toshiro Kageyama, but there is plenty of examples. 

Any doubts don't hesitate to ask me. I am "wtamesty" in KGS.

I hope I was of any help, cheers.])
