C[Dear reviewer, my name is Biondy 15k+ player in IGS, for awhile I'm stuck between 14k and 15k+. I keep on losing my game. I wonder why.

This is a game against 14k+ player w/ reverse komi.

The opening was very flavourable to me, but I made terrible thing in middle game and lose by 1.5 points, but it was also because some unneeded move by white.

I hope you can improve my go.

Thank you in advance];B[pj]C[This is not a mistake nor slipped hand.
I wanted to try this kind of thing];W[dp];B[jp];W[qp];B[jd]
;W[pc];B[dj];W[dd]C[J: as you probably know, you're already far behind. The only advantage of playing this way (apart from experimental learning) is that you can upset your opponents.]
;B[op];W[pm];B[qn]C[is this right?
Can white kill black here?

J: A bit difficult to know, but I guess B can escape or live small behind.Q10 and P4 make the killing very difficult.]
;W[pn];B[qm];W[ql];B[po];W[qo];B[rl];W[rk]C[strange.....

J: a big mistake];B[pl];W[qk];B[om];W[rn];B[rm];W[sm];B[on]
;W[sl];B[qf]C[maybe I should approach from the other side, but don't know where.

J: yes, this side is open, but there's no easy approach from the upper side. You can consider that leaving R9 alive in the right is bad for you, as it lessens the value of Q/R 14/15]
;W[pk];B[ok];W[pq]C[J: This is very bad for W! Maybe you won't notice, but you can shut him now there, sente, and that's big! (see var)
He had better left Q9 unplayed]
(;B[oq];W[pr];B[or];W[lp]C[J: Previous moves can be justified, but I think this one is too local. It even forces you to extend to the whereabouts of F3 to gain strength... white should be better playing at the upper right or other sides

Simple VAR follows]
(;B[mo]C[J: play away from thickness... get strong before at the left, the attack (or even attack directly, but from the left)]
;W[ko];B[lm];W[km]C[J: K4 is starting to feel lonely, and if that w group lives, your thickness will go to the waste]

;B[io];W[in];B[jn];W[ip];B[ho];W[jq];B[hp];W[iq]C[I think this exchange is ok.
White alive in bottom and I got quite influence outside

what d u think?

J: I think you had the influence before starting, and W invasion was premature. W should have lived smaller, see var (just after invasion)]
;B[fm];W[gq];B[hq];W[hr];B[gr];W[is]C[J:???];B[fr];W[dr];B[fp]
;W[dn];B[dl]C[J: I'd rather D14 or similar];W[ch]C[J: the last exchange was very good for W, even if you secured healthy life there. D2, D6 and C12 are big. Now the point is if you will be able to make all your center thickness count! or if W will be able to trash it!]
;B[fc]C[J: good!];W[ec];B[fd];W[ef]C[nice move. preventing me to create stronger influence...

J: He's probably scared of your center]
(;B[ff]C[and a bad move by me I guess. I hope you can help me to handle thing here.

J: ok. Not much to do there at the moment. Given that there are not too many points at the upper right area, something like BN17, W S16, better see var

Also, you know, touching the opponent makes him stronger!];W[eh]
;B[ee];W[df];B[de];W[ce];B[fi]C[J: if you plan to close the center, it is too near. Also O/N 17 much bigger stil]

J: :) not so];W[lh];B[lf];W[kg];B[mf];W[fe]C[J: This is *small* White should play almost any other place!!!]
;B[rj]C[J: good!];W[ro];B[qj]C[J: good, nice sequence!];W[sk]
;B[sj];W[sn];B[ps]C[maybe this is too fast. where should I play?

J: yes, a bit too early. Depending on how did you fell, at this point, I'd chased all center W groups :) O17 splitting W upper group seems nice, too. You probably know you're better at fighting than him, so at this moment only a big mistake can make you lose the game. Curious about how it happened.]
;W[qs];B[os];W[rr];B[mp];W[lq];B[oe]C[Hmm.... I don't think this is a good move, wonder where 2 play.
Please help me

J: not too bad, at least it has the correct idea of closing the center. Maybe it is a bit ambiguous. P14 closes more, O17 splits, this P15 is a little bit undefined. But not too bad]
;W[od];B[ne];W[nd];B[ld];W[lc];B[bm]C[J: good moment. You're really way behind, so time to start closing.]

;B[kh]C[I'm so STUPID. I was too greedy and blind here. Made white alive.

From here I hope you can help me in yose, especially if u find a way for me to turn the table around.

J: I'll try, but yose is not my strongest part...
(after trying) not too many ideas, please see the comments and a couple of vars. Not too many things for a player like me, I just think you should have keeped the sente a bit more.]
