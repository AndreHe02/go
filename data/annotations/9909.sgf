C[[R\] Hi Felix. My name is Uwe and i'll do the review for you. I hope you'll find it helpfull.


While creating this review i have noticed two things, i want to share, in the hope it'll help you to improve.

- Sometimes you play to hastily while fighting. Take your time and try to think about the purpose of the attack and find a proper move. 

- You sometimes focus to much on one area of the board. Even in a fight its important to take a look around (as you'll see :-)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc]

(;B[cj]C[[R\] In general you've played a solid opening. But in this position i would prefer A to get more options.

I've provided a few typical paths of this opening.];W[qn]LB[qj:A]
[nq:B]C[[R\] R6 is ok but A and B are better.
A is a better move to destroy your framework and B is the right side to attack.]
;B[nq];W[rq]
(;B[rp]LB[qq:A][rp:B]C[S3 normally too far but how to punish it properbly ?

[R\] S3 is too far indead, but it is not that simple to punish.

The best way to punish him is to play A. White then needs to play B and the game is back to normal, but white is missing an important stone.

S4 is the only move if you want to fight directly.];W[qp]
(;B[qq]MA[qo]C[[R\]I think the other side is more promissing. That way both of you don't get much, but you're in a better position afterwards.]
;W[qo];B[rr];W[pq];B[qr];W[op];B[pr];W[po]
(;B[oq]LB[mo:A][fq:B]C[think this is not too bad for b, corner is small but w overconcentrated, but instead of p3 tenuki better right ?

[R\] Thats right. P3 isn't important.
Locally A is a good move, but B is more important and bigger.]
;W[fq]
(;B[cn]C[too far, c7 should be better

[R\] C6 is perfectly fine. C7 is to far away to attack. White can then play C5 and is happy]

(;W[cl]LB[bp:A]C[[R\] instead of this attack, white should simply secure the corner with A]

(;B[bl]C[[R\] This is a good way to attack the invader, but i think it would be better to attack the corner.]
;W[bk];B[ck];W[bm];B[dl];W[cm];B[dm]
(;W[bn]C[[R\] White normaly plays the cut D6 instead]
(;B[dn]C[[R\] This move is a mistake and let white take the entire corner. Don't fear the cut, play C5 instead.]
;W[co]
(;B[bj]LB[qj:A][qg:B]C[good for w, corner is big, b just outside influence and a littlte of territory left side.
but w some weaknesses bottom, maybe later

[R\] You're right, thats very good for white. You lost around 10 points in the corner.
But now you have sente. Don't waste it to secure territory while there are big points left to take.
A and B are good points to take.];W[pj]
(;B[jd]LB[qf:A][qh:B]C[[R\] This point is good, but A is the important point for white now, so you should play on B.]
;W[qf]
(;B[ph]LB[qh:A][nd:B]C[overplay ?
just extend 016 better ?

[R\] It is possible to attack here, but then you should play on A. (Have a look at the variations)
 
B is a much better move right now. It secures your border and helps with an  invasion later on.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[[R\] This is the right direction. Now you'll get a solid wall.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[pf]C[[R\] This move is helping you.]
(;B[of]C[[R\] but you should cut right away];W[og];B[pg];W[ng]
;B[qe];W[re];B[rf]LB[rd:A]C[[R\] A go proverb says: cut the side you don't want. You should play on A here.

For details why, have a look at:
http://senseis.xmp.net/?CutTheSideYouDontWant];W[rg];B[qg];W[sf]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[se];W[pb];B[ob];W[qa]C[s18 should do the trick here.....

[R\] Yes it does]
(;B[sc];W[sb]C[[R\] Its still possible to kill this group. Instead of S18 you should have played S19]

(;B[rb];W[sd];B[re];W[ra];B[sc]LB[mo:A][jq:B][qj:C]C[[R\] This is a good ko threat for later in the game. 
Now that this group is alive, try to find another spot to play.

A to reduce whites framework and prepare an invasion

B to secure a big point (it is more important after A)

or fight locally with C];W[qb]
(;B[rh]LB[mo:A][jq:B][qj:C]C[tenuki better ?

[R\] Yes! 
A is the best point.

See the comments on move 71 for more details];W[nb]
(;B[oi]LB[oa:A]C[[R\] Don't tenuki! P19 is important.

P11 is actually helping white securing the territory while you gain nothing in return.]
;W[oj];B[ni];W[nj]
(;B[md];W[oc]C[here plan was to make sth in the center, since i had the wall on the left side

[R\] Since you already inforced a wall in the center with the last moves, it doesn't help you to get another wall. Instead you should have keeped the territory.

White is now still leading with something around 15 points. If you've played P19 the game would be even.]
;B[hb];W[gb];B[hc];W[nd];B[me];W[mc];B[mi];W[jh];B[mj]LB[mo:A]
[kg:B]C[[R\] If you want to attack the lower right corner A would be a good move.
If you try to stop white from living inside your walls, then play B instead]
;W[rj];B[ml];W[je]
(;B[kd]TR[hb][hc][jd]LB[ie:A]C[[R\] Don't let white to easily life. If he attaches to your stone, you have to weaken this stone even more.

And since the marked stones are a little lonley you should play on A]
;W[he];B[gd];W[ge];B[fe];W[ff]LB[fd:A]C[[R\] Now you have alot of cutting points. It is better to play A here]

(;B[gf]LB[gh:A]C[[R\] This is much to close and is helping white to get an eye. 
First reduce the living space with A.];W[gg];B[if];W[hf];B[ie]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[lh];B[hh]C[[R\] You try to prevent the second eye, but you need a proper follow up move. 

You have alot of cutting points everywere and i think it would be best to let him life and reduce the impact]
;W[hg];B[fg];W[fh];B[eg];W[jk]
(;B[jj]C[[R\] It isn't the time for more weak stones. Rescue H12 and white still needs to run]
;W[ij];B[kj];W[gj];B[ik];W[hk];B[il];W[hl];B[ii];W[hi];B[hj]
;W[gi];B[ih];W[ij];B[ji];W[im]LB[gh:A]C[[R\] This fight went really well for you, but now you get greedy.
Instead of killing everything you could just have played A.
White still needs to rescure the rest of his stones and you could have invaded the lower right side.]

(;B[jl];W[jm];B[kl];W[gh];B[hj]C[[R\] This ko doesn't help you. White could just defend the cut instead of wasting ko threats]

(;W[fd];B[ee];W[ij];B[hm];W[gm];B[hn];W[jo];B[gn];W[fm];B[fn]
C[from here on i´m a little bit lucky since w can just cut @ e6 right ?
how connect or play better ?

[R\] This situation is very tricky. But i think he can't. If he tries his group would die]

(;W[fk];B[em];W[ej]C[[R\] Now white is alive. Don't try to kill him, secure the cutting points]

(;B[fl];W[gl];B[ek];W[el];B[dk];W[eh];B[fl];W[hj];B[jg]C[[R\] This cut is very big now]
;W[dg];B[ef];W[ch];B[bh]C[[R\] Very good!];W[bg];B[cg];W[dh]
;B[bf];W[bi];B[ag];W[ci];B[ai];W[al]C[[R\] This is the result of to much attacking and to many weak points.
White is trying to kill you now and set up a ko to split your group]
;B[be];W[bd];B[ae]C[i don´t think its necessary at the moment, i can play @ bottom and don´t give up sente

[R\] I think you should have played at the bottom to get some eyes and reduce whites space]
;W[kc];B[qk]C[[R\] This is an very important move!];W[qj];B[pl]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[ql];B[pk];W[sk];B[om];W[nl];B[nm];W[ol];B[pm]
;W[ro];B[mo]C[[R\] And this is the key move to decide the game. You've successfully invaded whites territory and keep 2 week groups separated]

(;W[iq]C[[R\] White should have saved this group.

30 Points difference if the white group in the center dies]

(;B[hq]C[[R\]A very good move. I didn't find a better one to attack here, but whats about the white group on the lower right?]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[io];B[gp];W[jp];B[gq];W[ho]
(;B[fp]TR[im][jm][jo][io][ho][hp][jp][iq]LB[kq:A]C[[R\] You don't always need to push your way ahead. Instead think about to use the next move you would play after that.

BTW:
This is your last chance to kill the marked group, but it may lead to a ko. Just play the vital point A.]
;W[kq];B[eq];W[dq];B[er];W[dr];B[ds];W[cs];B[es];W[br]LB[aj:A]
C[this is really good for b since corner @ left side is not big anymore

[R\] This result is very good for black. 
If we count the lower right group as alive, then you're leading with 5 points.

But you have sente and the cut at A isn't much of a problem anymore]
;B[jr]C[tryied to kill now since w no 2 eyes, but which is the best way ?

[R\] White is alive. L3 was the key move.]

;W[mq];B[or];W[jq];B[ln];W[kn];B[sp];W[so];B[sq]C[[R\] Now you have killed the white group and you are leading with 75 points]

[R\] Only that you don't need to win this ko :-)
Both groups are alive]
(;B[bl];W[rq]C[yeah from here on its somehow over, many kos but nothin special happened

[R\] You both seem to like kos :-).
