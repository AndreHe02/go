C[Hi!
I am currently 10k on the Internet Go Server. I think the biggest area of improvement you need is in understanding how to play boldly (in addition a general knowledge of basic skills, of course). Once you understand this, you will increase your strength greatly! If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to e-mail me at j3r3mee@yahoo.com

;B[dp];W[cc]C[I have never encountered someone playing "low" like this... it took me by surprise.

What should I do in response to this?

White has played an uncommon fuseki here. As you may be aware, the 4-4 point is oriented for center-territory and influence, while the 3-3 point is oriented towards securing corner territory. Personally, I can't say white's opening is wrong, but I strongly prefer to be black in this situation. White's stones do secure the corner; but at the cost of slow development. Black, as his stones are higher, have more "potential" for territory and are more flexible.]

(;B[dj]C[This move is doable, as it begins to create a framework for black on the lower-left side. However, it is important to play actively, so I would prefer to approach one of white's 3-3 stones. Please see variation.]
;W[qj];B[jp]C[At this point, look at who has used his stones more efficiently. Black is on the fourth line, and white is on the third line. With a few more moves, who looks to have more territory? With the same amount of stones, black has covered territory a whole line hire. It is important to use stones efficiently, and I believe black has definitely had a better opening here. White's moves are contradictory. In the beginning, he plays the 3-3 points. Now, he plays R10, showing a desire to create a "framework". If white wanted to get territory through a framework, then there was no point in playing the 3-3 in the first place.]
;W[jq]C[Here I feel he played too close to me.

How to punish him for this?

Unfortunately, not all go matches are peaceful. Sometimes, the players play far away from each other, and other times, a move like this will be used to seek complications. However, this move is very valid, and shows white is wanting to start a fight. The most important thing here is to realize that he is (around) the same strength as you and you should not be afraid to fight. In this situation, you get to make the move and can get the advantage in the fight. See variations for different responses.]

(;B[kp]C[This is a valid response. It is peaceful, and creates influence facing towards the center. However, it lets white off too easy. Black has the advantage in this situation.]
;W[kq]
(;B[lp]C[It's important to place more pressure on white. If you hane here, you can cut off white's stone and smother its liberties. There is a proverb "Hane at the head of two stones". It doesn't apply always, but its good advice.]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[mq];B[np];W[nq];B[op];W[oq];B[pp];W[pq]C[Here he let me walk along the 4th row... that's supposedly a bad thing, but now he owns a lot of territory at the bottom.

Should I have "chased" him horizontally like this?

I think you misunderstand the proverb. Black is on the fourth row, but what "do not push on the fourth line" means is; white shouldn't be on fourth line, with black on the fifth line. If white was on the fourth line and black was on the fifth line, white would have too much solid territory for the tradeoff of black's wall.]
;B[qp];W[rp]C[Here, you have a wall. But, see the white stone at R10? It "nullifies" the black wall and the chance for it to make territory. Black Blocking at S5, white connecting at S3, and black then moving at R10 would be ideal and would leave black ahead in the game. However, as I said, The white R10 stone is "exactly" where a black stone needs to be, and makes it too easy for white to make a solid base near black's thickness.]

(;B[iq];W[ir]
(;B[ce]C[I initiate my attack on the low stone

This works, or you can go out again at H3.];W[hq]C[It is important to know when to tenuki, or play elsewhere. Is this one stone that white eats important? what if he does? He's already encroached onto the lower right side, there's not much territory for black there since white can jump there at any moment. You don't always have to respond to your opponents move. Sometimes its necessary, but many times it isn't. Lets see if hypothetically this move is ignored.]

(;B[ip];W[jc];B[qh];W[cj]C[Here again, he plays to close. I should've realized that he was trying to get the territory near the wall after the first episode, but I did not.]
;B[di]C[Again, hane is a stronger response. This response is "safe" but also too "timid". Remember, his fighting ability should be around the same level as yours, so there is no need to shy away.]

;W[bn];B[af];W[ag];B[jb]C[Curious to see how he responds to close play, so I played like he did.]
;W[ae];B[ed];W[de]C[Uh oh. Trouble. I only have two liberties for that group.]
;B[dd];W[ee];B[fe];W[ib];B[kb];W[jj]C[With this move, he sets up to escape the ladder. But I don't realize what he is doing.]

(;B[kc]C[A closed triangle is a good shape.

Yes, but again, cutting is a stronger response.];W[ef];B[ff]
;W[eg]C[Ladder still works, try this.]
(;B[ii]C[I move to block his remedy of my ladder, but now he has time to escape.

There are two ways of standard techniques of capturing stones; ladders and nets. Always play a net if possible. See variation.]
;W[fg];B[cd];W[gg];B[hf];W[fd]
(;B[gd];W[fc];B[ic];W[ec];B[dc];W[db];B[cb];W[bd]C[Black has a stronger fuseki. By not utilizing his 4-4 points for power and influence, however; white was let off easy to make territory. Though white ate these stones in the upper left, the game isn't over yet. black still has a lot of potential territory left in the middle. A black move like S5 will close off the center, creating a MASSIVE moyo. Though white can invade, if would be difficult to live in the middle. The winner may very likely hinge on whether or not white is able to live in the center, as it occurs in many games.

The main points for improvement:
1.Don't be timid in your response. Hane (bend) at the head of two stones more often. Yes, you can be cut, but if you play first, then you have the advantage (However, protecting the cut is sometimes important if the opponent is strong nearby). Your opponent only has as much fighting ability as you have (if closely ranked).  There are different playing styles, and some like to play more peacefully, but it is important to play boldly regardless.
2. Know when to tenuki (play somewhere else). So what if he eats one stone, or six? Twelve points in gote isn't much compared to big fuseki points. Getting another fuseki stone can easily be worth as much as 30 points. On the other hand, don't avoid crucial moves. For example, your opponent exploits thin play and destroys your eyes in the corner, allowing him to make territory while you are chased running. The good thing is, many times your tenuki will maintain sente (the opponent cannot ignore your move without a loss). You control the flow of the game and make territory where you want.
3. Learn joseki, and see the reasoning behind it. These lines of plays have been developed by professionals  and are possible BEST moves as a sequence. If you know how to punish mistakes in a joseki sequence, you will benefit. 

In short: Play bolder! Don't follow your opponent around, and when you are at a tactical advantage, do not be afraid to play severely.

I GUARANTEE you that improvement in these three areas will lead to an increase in rank of at least several stones. If you have any questions, let me know.

Best of Luck,

An important concept is that this wall is not only useful for "making territory", but will be useful if there are any fights later and can serve as a ladder breaker.]
