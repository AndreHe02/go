;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[jp]LB[do:a][co:b][pj:c][fc:d]C[This is the wrong direction. 'a' ,'b' or 'c' would be standard.  If B is going to play along one of the sides the top side is better because it has a follow up move at  'd'.  There is no such follow up move at the bottom.  It is best to play this move after W has made his shimari..]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[do];W[co];B[cn]LB[dp:a][cp:b][dn:c][fq:d]
[dj:e]C['a' makes better use of B5.  After the standard joseki starting with this move (b thru) W ends up with a stone at 'd' which complete nullifies B5.]
;W[cp];B[dn];W[fq];B[cj]LB[dj:a][cf:b]C[B5 now looks like a silly move.  If the stones had been played in a different order B certainly would not play at 5 now.  This move would be too close to Ws thickness at W14.  If the moves had been played in a different order B15 would have been at 'a' and B would now play at 'b'.]
;W[cg];B[qj];W[eg]C[Too slow.  The corner is still open and this does not threaten the B group below]
;B[dc]LB[oj:a]C[Too early.  B has no need to panic and invade even though it look like W is forming a big territory.  After all, W need another move in gote to complete it. Playing at 'a' looks best]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[cc];B[fc]C[B MUST connect.  Giving up B19 is equivalent to passing and ten playing 2 weak stones inside Ws territory.  If B conects he has no trouble living.]
;W[db];B[ed];W[dc];B[gb]LB[ie:a]C[Too heavy.  B21 is not an important stone as W gain little by capturing it.  B should jump away lightly at 'a'.  In this situation where B is heavily outgunned he should not worry about saving every stone.  The key is to get away quickly and then come back and connect the other stones later.  If W prevents that connection he does so in gote.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[id];W[ic];B[hc];W[ie];B[ib]LB[hd:a][jc:b]
C[B has done it again.  Letting W capture 31 and make such a strong outward facing shape is out of the question.  The B stones are 7, 3, and 5 are all high and so are useless if W gets a strong outside shape.  If B connects and W plays at 'b' the B can easily get out because of the aji of B25 so he is save and W is still split.]
;W[hd];B[gc]LB[ge:a]C[What is this!  Why not at 'a'?];W[jb]
LB[ge:a]C[Has to be at 'a' to seal B in.  B is not going to die so this move serves little purpose]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[ff];W[ee];B[he]LB[hf:a]C['a' is correct as this move give W the chance to seal B in and then play a ko.]

;W[dk];B[ck];W[fb];B[gg]LB[ig:a]C['a' is better shape and still gives multiple ko threats.  Ths move leaves B with a weak shape on the outside even if he lives.]
;W[hg];B[eb];W[dl];B[cl];W[fb];B[hh];W[ig];B[eb];W[nq];B[da]
C[This exchange has been very bad for B. The 3 stones 41,57,63 are effectively useless and the W stones at the top are no strong.  B has got nothing in exchange.]
;W[kq];B[jq]C[Wrong direction.  B can make no territotu on the edge so this move has no purpose except to stp W from connecting.  But letting him do that and gettign an outside wall is not so bad.  This must be a block on top.]

[no:b][kr:c][ml:d][kl:e]C[Giving W the chance to play 'a' makes him a lot stronger.  B also loses the cut at 'c' which, in conjuntion with the hane at 'c' is very hard on W.  Better shape it to just play at 'd' or, better still if you are confident of the fight, 'e']

(;B[lk]C[Must block without even thinking. See the variation.]
;W[kk];B[lj];W[kj];B[on];W[no];B[qn];W[om];B[lm]C[There is little chance of killing any W stones so giviing up 89 to save 77 makes little sense.]
;W[pn]LB[nl:a]C[Better to atari at 'a' first to force B into bad shape.  Once W94 is play B will not answer a move at 'a']
;B[qm];W[ok];B[nl];W[oi]C[Must conect to keep B separated];B[ol]
;W[pm];B[pl];W[li];B[ph];W[mi];B[pc]C[W was outplayed in this whole sequence and B is now comfortably ahead. Ws only chance is to attack the 4 B stones are the bottom.]
;W[hn];B[ho]LB[go:a][gp:b]C[Too heavy after W hanes at 'a'. 'b' is better.]
