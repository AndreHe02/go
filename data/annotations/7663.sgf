C[usagi5 [6k\]: hi!
eleinad [6k\]: hi!

I played this game on February 14, 2010. I won by nearly twenty points, but I got very confused during the game. I have inserted comments.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[hq]C[I played another game recently the started like this and white pincered. I jumped into the corner and white blocked from C4. This gave white a giant wall, so I decided to play a double-kakari instead.

*this move usually only played if q4 is at r4, but the difference is a little subtle for me as well.]
(;B[cn]C[*this move is fine. i attached a couple other common options. Actually you can tenuki as well since w cannot secure the corner with just one more move]
;W[dn]C[There might be some special response to this attachment in particular, but I decided to play it safe and just jump into the corner.

*this w is not a great move]
(;B[cq]C[this is safe, but does not punish w's mistake];W[dq]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[do];B[cm];W[go]
(;B[jp]LB[de:A]C[I thought this was a good move to reduce white.

*don't worry about that yet. A is big, works well with your lower left.]
;W[lp]C[How should I respond to this?

*this is an overplay. separate and stretch out like you did is fine. w should have played like k2, try to get some territory and sente.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]C[*19-22 could (maybe should) have been played before k4]
;B[nq]C[I thought protecting the corner was important.

*this is good. k4 is light. so build some strength and let k4 m4 run with each other to your advantage.]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[ir];B[jr];W[ln];B[jn]C[Now I have to run.

*but so does m4 group];W[ll];B[hp];W[gp];B[jl];W[hl]C[*w already made a mistake with m4, now he is stretching too far. when you cut and make multiple weak groups the game is over]
;B[hm];W[gm];B[gl]C[This may not have been particularly good, but I thought the cross-cut might open up a few weakness of white's.

*your group is stronger than m4 because of m2 connection in reserve so starting a fight is not a bad idea, but this makes things pretty complicated]
(;W[hn];B[im];W[ik];B[jk];W[ij];B[jj];W[ih];B[pj]C[I thought this was the biggest move. I thought the my stones in the middle could not be closed off, because I could connect underneath with M2, if I needed.

*I think it is a good thought process, I would prefer r7 securing the corner. already your lead in the game is huge.]
;W[lj];B[ki];W[mi];B[kg];W[ji];B[kj]C[Should I have ataried first? I thought that if I did, there would be no nozoki at H11 later to reduce white.

*this is good, it makes w snake weaker.];W[kh];B[lh];W[jh];B[fm]
;W[gn];B[li];W[mj];B[hi]C[I nozoki.];W[hh];B[gi];W[ii];B[pm]
C[*this is a little thin. white is in serious trouble, but you don't need to kill the snake to win. How about r4 or r5 yourself?]
;W[qp]C[This confused me. How should I respond to this?]
(;B[qo];W[po]C[This further confused me. I thought it would be safest to nobi at Q3.]
;B[pq];W[qn];B[ro];W[pn];B[rp];W[qm];B[pl];W[no];B[pg];W[pi]
;B[qi];W[qj];B[qk];W[qh];B[rj];W[ph];B[qg];W[rh];B[og];W[ok]
;B[oj];W[nh];B[rl];W[rm];B[ri];W[nk];B[pk];W[om];B[mg];W[re]
;B[qe]C[Maybe I should have just defended my corner.];W[rd]
;B[qc]C[I still can keep part of the corner, but the shape looks questionable.]
;W[rg];B[jd];W[jb]C[This is another move that confused me. How should I respond to this?]
;B[kc];W[gc];B[kb];W[jg]C[*from here the game is won, even though you didn't do as well as you could have on the right hand side.

you must learn how to estimate if the game is close or not, you gave away entire upper left and still won by 20 pts!

so just play something like c14, make a living group, or best case a giant left hand side.

keep the game simple when you have the advantage, make it more complicated if you are behind^^

last comment];B[gg]C[Maybe it would have been better to just jump to C11 or D11.]
;W[gh];B[fi];W[fh];B[de]C[Should I have played E11 instead?]
;W[ei]C[I underestimated the danger of this hane.];B[fk];W[fg]
;B[gf]C[I probably should have just let these stones go.];W[ff]
;B[ge];W[fe];B[dh]C[I nozoki, but white doesn't respond as I expected.]
;W[di];B[eh]C[I misread here and don't realize how short of liberties my stones are.]

;W[bf];B[be];W[cd];B[ce];W[dd]C[Is there any way for me to have saved my stones after I cut with E12?]
;B[ci];W[bd];B[dj];W[ej];B[ek];W[ae];B[ic]C[I try to push down while supporting my three G14 stones. I thought capturing with J18 would hurt the three stones too much.]

;W[sd];B[bi]C[I thought this was much bigger than S18. It white got B11, and I took B10, then A10 would be sente for white.]
;W[rb];B[qb];W[sa];B[hr]C[He I start a ko. Maybe it wasn't necessary. I couldn't tell the score; I'm pretty bad at counting.]
;W[hs];B[gq];W[fp];B[hr];W[qr];B[rr];W[hq];B[rf];W[fr]C[White doesn't respond to my threat. I don't know why; white had many more ko threats than I do.]
;B[sf];W[ha];B[ib];W[ia];B[jc]C[I didn't want to start another ko with K19.]
;W[ja];B[ka];W[ga];B[ol];W[nl];B[lo];W[mo];B[lq]C[Here I try to use the weakness in white's shape, though it was a rather vague idea.]
;W[mp];B[mn];W[nn]C[White doesn't want to take a chance with it, so he lets me have a few stones.]
