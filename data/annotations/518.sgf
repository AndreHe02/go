C[Let me make a few general comments.

First I know from much personal experience how frustrating it can be to
lose by a big score. It can certainly happen no matter how close the 2
players are in strength. In your case, I think 2 factors played a role:

1) Your opening absolutely committed you to taking a lot of territory in
the center, which is not easy to do. Gaining territory is easiest in the
corner, then the sides, and hardest in the center. I personally find
myself emphasizing the center too much in many of the games I lose.

2) You lost a huge group (a dragon). It started with some so-called
"heavy" plays when the group was small. If a group is small and weak, it
is many times better to sacrifice it, rather than make a big committment
to saving it. It is important to have a constant awareness of how strong
your groups relative to the enemy groups in the vicinity. Later, you
could have saved the group, if you had been able to visualize where to
get 2 eyes near the edge of the board and keep the eyes connected to the
rest of the group.];B[dp];W[ed]C[The most center oriented of the usual opening corner moves.]
;B[pp]C[b's moves at 4-4 points of 2 corners are very popular and center
oriented themselves.  r4 would be somewhat less center oriented and r3
most oriented to obtaining sure territory in the corner.];W[pj]
C[A very unusual move. The safer course is play in the remaining corner,
perhaps q16,q17,or r16.
If w really wants to ignore the corner for now, he should probably play
an approach move against one of b's corners, like c6 or r6 or something
similar.
Play in go usually progresses from corners to sides to center, because
it is easier to get territory in the corner or on the side.]
;B[pd]C[b stakes a claim to the remaining corner. Because it is easier to make
territory in the corner, his move is worth more than w.s previous move.]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[jn]C[This is a very high (near the center of the board) move for this early
in the game.  Better would be an approach move like r6,r14, or o17. One could also
consider a move to reinforce the d7 stone like e7 or d10.];B[jp]
C[I might have played a move in the upper right like n17 or even k16
here.];W[nd]C[A good move! Works well with w's other stones.]
;B[oc];W[nb]C[o17 is better. o18 invites b to cut which he does.]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[ob];W[mb]C[n16 better. w can afford to sacrifice o18 and n16 works well with his
center stones.];B[qh];W[oh]C[This move is probably ok at this point, but it probably represents the
final step in a stategic commitment for w that is difficult to achieve.
w is mapping out a large area of influence from upper left, down the
left side and across the top, but this area will be very diffcult to
hold on to.  b has influence in 3 corners, at the bottom and in the
upper right. His areas are smaller but much more secure.  The upper
right is almost certain territory. w's area is too big and too open to
expect to keep.];B[of];W[nf];B[qj]C[b increases the size and security of his upper right.]
;W[pi];B[pg];W[qi];B[rh]C[s11 seems better. s12 makes corner strong, but it already looks pretty
good.];W[oe];B[pe];W[oa];B[od];W[ne];B[ce]C[The fact that b can successfully play in this corner is one reason why
w can't expect to hold onto his sphere of influence.];W[df]
;B[dc];W[dd];B[cd];W[bf]C[again c14 better.];B[cf];W[bg];B[de]
C[b just keeps cutting w's connections, insuring that his corner group
will escape and destroy w's sphere of influence.];W[dg]C[e15 better. w would like to hold b against the left side to get some
territory in the center.];B[ee];W[fe]C[f16 better. Otherwise all of w's stones are weak with few liberties.]
;B[fd];W[ff];B[ef];W[ec];B[fc];W[eb];B[db];W[fb];B[gc]C[b can kill with g18. As it is w starts chasing b's weak group]
;W[gb];B[hc];W[hb];B[ib];W[ic];B[id];W[jc];B[hd];W[je]C[Fortunes have reversed due to b's error. Now b's group at h16 will be
in trouble if w can stablize his weak stones at f14.
h14 would put pressure on b's group, but f13 might be even better.]
;B[jd];W[kc]C[A move like k14 to strengthen the weak k15 stone would be better. The
k17 and g18 stones are in no immediate danger.];B[kd];W[ia]
C[This move not needed. W should strengthen k15 stone and f15 stones.]
;B[ld];W[jb]C[Not needed, see previous comments. Consider n16 to link center stones
to base.];B[md];W[lc]C[Not needed. W needs to strengthen his center stones and kill black's
group.];B[ng];W[mf]C[This is a heavy move (a move to escape with a group that has few
liberties that doesn't really gain many liberties for it). Better might
be p13, b q14, w n13 catches black stone in ladder.];B[mg];W[lf]
;B[kg]C[Errors by both sides have lead to an exciting capturing race!]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[ke];B[kf];W[le];B[if];W[og];B[mh];W[pf];B[qf]
;W[of]C[w seems to escape, but his group still has no eyes and b should be
able to use his central stones to take a good portion of the center.]
;B[nj]C[Harassing w's eyeless group, but b might be better to escape himself
with h14 or h13];W[pk];B[oi];W[ph];B[rj];W[qk];B[ol];W[pl];B[pm]
;W[nk];B[ok];W[oj];B[ni];W[om];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml];W[qm];B[pn]
;W[qn];B[ro];W[qo];B[po];W[qp];B[rl];W[rn]C[w should s11 and s9 to break b's connection before b can ensure it.]
;B[ql];W[rk];B[sk];W[rm];B[sl];W[si]C[t7 kills and makes w live.]
;B[ri]C[Now the capturing race is on again, but w has a lot more to lose.]
;W[sh];B[sg];W[ie];B[he];W[hf];B[gf];W[hg];B[ge];W[jf];B[ig]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[jh];B[hh];W[kh]C[w gets one eye, but can he escape or get another!]
;B[ji];W[ki];B[kj]C[k10 might be better. b can't afford to have a bunch of cutting points
in his groups surrounding w.];W[li];B[mi];W[mk];B[lk];W[lm]
C[k10 probably saves w's group.];B[ll];W[ii]C[k10 better!];B[jj]
;W[jk];B[kk];W[ij];B[mm];W[mn];B[nn];W[on]C[A wasted move. These stones are dead. Better to play g13, b e13, w
g12, catches b group at h12 in a ladder and save w's big central group.]
;B[oo];W[kl];B[gg]C[That's it. W's group has only one eye and is dead. Game is essentially
over.];W[nh];B[mj];W[qc];B[qb];W[pa];B[pb];W[qa];B[ra];W[qg]
