C[Hello and thank you for reviewing my game.

I'm dochanh, play at around 8k on KGS. This game was played against The Many Faces of Go [6k\], and I'm 6k in The Many Faces of Go version 12.010 now

I was White in this game.

Any comments would be most helpful!

Thanks in advance,

Dochanh

Hi I'm Lib [2k}, your reviewer!];B[cp];W[pd];B[dc];W[qp]C[This move is kinda risky. the play of C4 and R4 means that the lower side is interesting for both players. Since after R4 black has sente, I would advise against it. Any play by B along the lower side would be disadvantageous for W.]
;B[qf];W[oq]C[again, considering the open nature of the lower left corner, I would prefer a slightly more aggressive play. maybe not an attack at E4 due to a possibility of a counter attack, but perhaps somewhere around K3 would have been good.]
;B[of];W[pk]C[slightly too close to the bottom right for my comfort. the bottom right is essentially a fortress. you have nothing to fear by playing Q10, or even Q11.

personally, I'd play O16. any moves along the right side is worth little due to the strong nature of you R4 group. you can easily reduce such plays.]
;B[eq]C[now the bottom side is uninteresting, since both corners are 'closed', with more potential facing the right (for W), and left (for B).]
;W[dj];B[iq];W[kp]C[OK. I'd prefer D15. since B has played J3 and not J4, B is unlikely to play M3 again, since that results in a flat territory. usually, you can gain much much more territory if it has stones on both the 3rd and 4th lines. An all-3-liner territory is hardly worth anything once you reduce it. But L4 is OK. Better than L3, anyway, IMO.]
;B[kr]
(;W[mq]C[slow. consider if you had NOT played this (see variation]
;B[ce]C[big move. it aims at both the D10 stone and the Q16 stone. either 1 will suffer.]
;W[cg]C[small. I would prefer N17. B would really love to play around that area to attack the Q16 stone and make territory along the top side at the same time. by playing N17 1st, you can prevent that, and aim at the 2 B stones along the right.]
;B[df];W[nd]C[OK. but considering the 2 B stones on the right side and the strong B stones at the top left corner, B can play M17 without much worry. so O16 is playable, but a little dangerous IMO.]
;B[ld]C[lol there you go.];W[me];B[rd];W[qc];B[mc];W[nc]C[painful but necessary.]

B's play is weird. W can kill the M17 group, and maybe even the L11 group. and yet B still decides to play G15...]

Sure, Bots are great at calculating and estimating territory gained per play (as seen from the opening), but they are not as good at balancing risk/gain (as seen from how the huge chunk in the middle died). I'd advise that you play more with humans since that'll give you a more balanced and realistic game.

that's all for now. See ya!

Also, Q9 compliments the lower right group for W.]))
