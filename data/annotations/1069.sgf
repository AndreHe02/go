PL[B];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf]C[W C14 can be played but is a bit submissive. A pincer at H17 or J16 would be better to take the initiative.]
;B[db];W[cc]C[W C17 indicates that W wants the corner territory, but this is inconsistent with the original move at D16 which aims at influence.]
;B[cn]C[B C6 should be at J17 to finish the joseki. Now W can attack both C6 and the F17 group.]
;W[cl];B[bp]
(;W[gp]C[W G4 is too easy on black. See the variation starting with W C5 for a better way to play.]
;B[en]C[B is very happy to play E6.];W[eo]C[Now W discovers too late that G4 was not such a good move since the link D4-G4 is too weak now. But C3 would be better than E5.]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[el];W[bl]C[W B8 is too low and still leaves the good point E9 to black. W now has an inferior position because of previous mistakes, so there is no real good move. But at least C9 is better than B9.]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[W is submissive again. This shows why C3 was better than E5.]
;B[cr]C[B C2 is too early. B should take the key point at E9 instead.]
;W[dr]C[W is submissive once more and overconcentrated. Extend instead around K4.]
;B[dj]C[B should simply play at E9 instead, forcing white to defend, and getting more influence in the center.]
;W[ek];B[go]C[B G5 is a "thank you" move, W is happy to answer at H4.]
;W[hp];B[fo]
(;W[cj]C[W C10 too submissive again, W can play at E10 (see variation).]
;B[fp];W[fq];B[ep];W[fr]C[connecting at G3 is better.];B[do]
C[B D5 is too small at this point.];W[kq];B[ee];W[dg]C[W answers again submissively. W should take the initiative elsewhere.]
;B[nq]C[B L10 or Q10 would be bigger than O3.];W[qf];B[qh]
(;W[of]C[W can take the corner instead.];B[nd]
(;W[qj]C[The joseki after W P14 is to take influence with W Q11 (see variation). R10 is not very good because black can simply separate white with Q11.]
;B[re];W[qm]
(;B[rf]C[B should separate white (see variation).];W[ph];B[qg]
;W[pg];B[qe]C[R15 is bad, the R14 stone is worthless now. B should directly cut at Q11.]
;W[pf]C[W is really too kind to be so submissive. Don't defend a worthless stone!]
;B[pi];W[qi]C[W R11 comes too late.];B[rg]C[B S13 is useless. B should cut W with B P11.]
;W[oj];B[oi]C[B should read the sequence first, to see that P11 doesn't work.]
;W[ni];B[mf];W[rp];B[qq];W[rq]C[S3 is big but playing on the top side may be bigger.]
;B[rr];W[qo];B[lr];W[kr]
(;B[lq]C[B is not in real danger and could play G15 instead (see variation).]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[lo]
(;B[nn]C[O6 is big, but G15 is probably larger (see variation).]
;W[jc];B[je]C[Without G15, B is much weaker on the left and cannot hope to kill white.]
;W[mc];B[nc];W[ld]
(;B[mb]C[B cannot hope to kill W since B is too weak on the left. B should reinforce first (see variation).]
;W[lb];B[md]C[Atari is generally bad (reinforces the opponent).]
;W[lc];B[le];W[hc];B[ge]C[Finally!];W[fg]
(;B[nb]C[B should reinforce at J16 first (see variation).];W[ie]
;B[if];W[he];B[hf]
(;W[jd]C[W is now stronger than B and could be more agressive (see variation).]
;B[gf];W[ke];B[jf];W[lf];B[me];W[kf];B[kd]C[L16 is meaningless since W can easily escape in the center.]

(;W[kc]C[W obeys passively once more :( W should play L12 (see variation).]
;B[hd];W[id];B[gc]C[Again B is trying to kill but W can easily escape in center.]
;W[gd];B[ib]C[This is an overplay.];W[hb];B[la];W[ka];B[ma]

(;W[jb]C[W is stronger than B now so W should attack instead of defend (see variation).]
;B[gb];W[ia]C[Again W should attack instead of defend.];B[lh]
C[B M12 is worthless. It doesn't make points and the W group is already alive. B should instead defend his weak group.]

(;W[cb]C[W E17 would put more pressure on B (see variation).]
;B[eb]
(;W[ho]C[The top B group still has only one eye so W could keep the pressure on B (see variation).]
;B[jo];W[jp]C[The K5 K4 exchange has favored W, so K5 was a bad move.]
;B[hn];W[in];B[jn]C[K6 is an overplay];W[io];B[im];W[hm];B[gn]

(;W[jm]C[W only attempts to take two stones in gote, but there are bigger moves, in particular taking profit by attacking the top black group (see variation).]
;B[il];W[kn]C[Capturing with L7 is better than L6, to avoid giving K8 to black. But H12 sente is bigger than taking two stones in gote.]
;B[jl];W[km];B[fk]C[Now that black is reinforced, it becomes almost impossible to attack the top black group, and B has once again the initiative.]
;W[ej]C[This shows why C10 was bad. C10 is now unnecessary.]
;B[fj];W[ei];B[fi];W[fh];B[gh]C[This is a big success for B.]
;W[kh];B[ki];W[jh];B[ji];W[ih]C[W J12 is an overplay];B[kg]
;W[hh]C[Another "thank you" move. W gives an additional prisonner and reinforces black.]
;B[gg];W[ef];B[fd];W[li];B[lg];W[lj];B[kk];W[kj]C[Another "thank you" move, reinforcing black and doing nothing for W.]
;B[jj];W[lk];B[kl];W[ll]C[M8 is worthless since B can simply play O8 to prevent white from making territory there. T2 or M1 are much bigger.]
;B[nh];W[oh];B[ks];W[js];B[ls];W[ir];B[mm]C[P7 or O8 would be larger, since W doesn't have to respond to N7.]
;W[hl]C[W should keep such moves as ko threats.];B[ik];W[hk]
;B[hj];W[ii];B[ij];W[hi]C[W has just wasted 4 ko threats.];B[gj]
;W[fl]C[This is a gift for B.];B[gi]C[B didn't have to connect.]

(;W[pn]C[W missed a tesuji at P4 (see variation)];B[np];W[mo]
;B[no];W[pr]C[Now that B is reinforced, such an invasion cannot work. And W no longer has T2 sente.]
;B[qr];W[nr];B[pq]C[B should simply play T2 instead.];W[oq]
;B[os]C[Again T2 is sufficient.];W[or];B[ps];W[qs];B[rs];W[sr]
