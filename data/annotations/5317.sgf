C[(Thanks for reviewing. I hope to improve from your comments).


Hello! It was an interresting game with two opponents of the same strength. A few of your moves were a little bit too small, noticeably during the ko, and that cost you the win.]

;B[re]
(;W[rf];B[nb];W[oc]C[Now you've made two groups, so there's probably an heavy fight coming by.
This should be avoided, except if you're really confident in your fighting skills.]

[dj:C][qm:B][jp:A]SQ[pi][qi][ri]C[The result is quite even, you even end up with a small wall that can be useful if you play around  A.

The living status of the upper right corner is quite clear, everything is alive, and there are no big potential for territory up there, so you should play elsewhere. A, B or C are possibilities among many others. D might provoque another fight.]

Moves 32 to 45 aren't very big. There are not bad moves, but there are bigger moves at this point of the game.]

It just might have been better to play around A, to make a good use of your now quite big wall.]

It's okay that way I think.];B[bj];W[bi];B[di];W[dk];B[ek];W[dn]
;B[en];W[cn]LB[hi:C][jl:B][qp:A]C[(I'm pretty quick to fill in a ko. Are there other moves that I could've gained from?)

Filling this ko is worth 1 point, there are probably 50 moves that are worth more.
A,b and C are exemples, you can probably find more by yourself.]

;B[jj];W[lk];B[kl];W[ll];B[qq]C[(Should I have played this move myself earlier in the game? This invasion hurt.)

Of course, you should have played it before, because it's bigger than m8 for instance. But it's always hard to find the good timing for this kind of purely defensive move, as it gives the hand to the opponent. I also tend to play these moves as late as possible, and I also find it is often too late.]

Black can save it easily. I don't understand why he doesn't.]

C[(At this point, I had to make a big decision. Did I make the right choice?)

Yes, but you didn't have to stop the ko so soon.];W[sg];B[ie]
LB[ne:A][ng:B][el:C][kq:D]C[You still have many ko threats. Even somthing like D, which is not that big, is interresting. In a ko fight, either you win the ko, either you get a free move. Even if the free move is only 4 point worth, it's free, so it's good (espacially as you have nothing to lose in this ko)]

I think the turning point was the ko, you could have gained more from it.
Of course, there were some mistakes, but there's no really escaping from them, exept playing more to improve your concentration and reading abilities.]
