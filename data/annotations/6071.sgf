C[Hello, Rasmus!

My name is Bernd, I play as HonFu (4k) on KGS.

I am going to review your game now. You will find lots of comments and variations, and at the end a summary of your major mistakes and what you could do to improve.

I tried my best to find everything, I hope you find it useful and enjoyable!]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[op];W[dd]TR[op]C[R.: is this an ordinary opening?

B.: I don't know if it is ordinary or not. But more important is the Question: What is every move trying to accomplish? 

As you improve, the intentions and the potential of moves you see will change. But nevertheless it's important not just to play common fuseki or joseki patterns by heart, but to (try to) understand the properties of a position anew with every move made!]
;B[nc]C[B.: With this move he prevents the big kakari around P17, which would also be an extension from D16. Furthermore he threatens to build a moyo on the right side. To break this up as you did is one usual strategy. Most often in this pattern P4 is at Q4 or Q3 instead.]

(;W[qm]C[R.: i played this one,because i thought otherwise black could become too strong and get too much territorry on the right side.should i have played elsewhere?this one doesnt  seem so good...

B.: With R7 you are trying not to let him have the whole right side - the thought is good. It's simply not possible to get more than that! Since he has more stones on that side, it is normal that he will have the advantage there, but you can get the advantage on the left side, if you for example play on D10 before he does! Anyway, I have included some variations.]
;B[qo];W[qj];B[om]C[B.: Wrong direction. He should have limited your eyespace with R12 to keep your group weak.]
;W[qg]C[R.: this one was probably bad,it gave me only small territorry and black could almost surround my group

B.: I'm not so sure about it. You take the weakness off your group and further reduce his shimari influence, which both is good. Not to leave weak groups is one of the most important principles of the opening, and since he just forced you to spread along the edge ...]
;B[of]C[B.: Now he builds influence towards the left side and threatens to spread himself on the top and bottom. You have to spoil that strategy now.]
;W[fq]C[B.: Extend cauteously towards his strength is one way of doing so. They tell us: Do not get too close to strength. He could extend towards your position now, but with the same flaw: He can't get too close. Most of the opening-problem-books have your move at g3, but I can't say much about it.]

(;B[lq]C[B.: This is too early, and too close to his position. He gets a bit overconcentrated and you have sente for bigger moves.]
;W[jq]C[R.: this one is bad,or not?the extends at D8,F17or even at D10 are probably better

B.: I would have played D10 now. Keep a move towards the lower right for later!]
;B[fc]C[B.: Now he takes the initiative on the upper side.]

(;W[hc]C[R.: am i strong enough for this one?how else could i have responded?
how good/bad was my opening ? which moves were good /wrong,where else should i have played?

B.: I think, K3 was the first move which was really not good. He gets the initiative now. You try to pincer him and get him into the corner, but this works better if you have already a stone at D10. The variation shows why.]

(;B[dc];W[fd];B[cd]
(;W[de]C[R.: is this one right?

B.: Too defensive. See my variation!];B[ed];W[ee];B[ec];W[gd]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[bg]C[R.: how should i have avoided this shape(it is very bad for white,isnt it?)?

B.: Yes. Your thickness is largely neutralized by the upper side corner, and the left side is now open at the bottom, which means that you won't be able to make a lot of territory there. See the earlier variation!]

(;W[bh]C[B.: Most of the time this is not a good move, since black can easily confuse your position, as I showed in a later variation.]
;B[ch];W[dh];B[ci];W[di]
(;B[bi];W[cm];B[fe]LB[df:A]C[B.: This shape you have to learn to recognize, because it's quite common. He cuts with the aim of playing A next!]
;W[ff];B[ge];W[he];B[gf];W[gg];B[hf];W[eg];B[df]C[B.: And here it is.]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[fh];B[hg];W[hh];B[ie]C[B.: You had to give a lot of way, lost most of what influence you had towards the center and your top stones are almost dead now.]
;W[if];B[ig];W[hd];B[jf];W[kc];B[lb];W[lc];B[mc];W[kb]
(;B[la]C[B.: With this move he helped you close this side in sente.]
;W[ka];B[na];W[gb];B[gc]C[B.: This also is a classical bad move. He doesn't confine you at the edge, instead he reduces his own liberties.]
;W[fb]C[B.: Good!]
(;B[eb];W[ko]C[B.: Beware! 

Before you tenuki, you should read out carefully, that the top really can't be killed! You spent the last 15 moves or so to rescue your weak stones, so it would be really annoying if they still died! I included some variations, and I think, you were in danger. While in the game, take your time to read things like this out, and if you are not sure, that you're alive as you stand, make one more safety move! I think, J18 should do.

(By the way: Practicing life and death is very important. Solve problems like a devil to learn reading out those situations! Insei also spend hours a day practicing life and death, which is in a way the fundament of all go strategy and tactics.)]

(;B[cb]C[R.: was there need of this one?

B.: No. (See 2nd variation one move earlier!)];W[mo]C[R.: now i would,instead of this one,prefer the play at C10 or D10

B.: Whatever you try with your center territory, he will have ways to reduce it, because your top center group has bad shape.

What's more important: N5. What exactly do you want to do? You always have to try to make a move that gives you some kind of profit (territory or power). What does N5 accomplish for you? Do you want to surround a large center area? You could have played immediately around K10 or M8 then. 

The reason why you should think about the profit of your move beforehand is -]
;B[mp]C[B.: - that your move helps him to strenghten his corner. You forced an answer, without really getting much for it. But he got something: His corner territory is safer now.]
;W[lp]C[B.: He is going to help you a lot now, more than necessary.]

(;B[np];W[kq];B[lr];W[kr]C[B.: You need this move to close the territory to the bottom - but now he has sente and should use it to reduce you from the other side - immediately. Something like my variation.

Moves like L2 must not be played too early. You had greater prospects in the center!

On the other hand, he could play O2 now, and then his corner should really be safe from invasion!]

(;B[ks]C[B. This one he shouldn't have played now, it's only a 3-point gote endgame move. As he answered, he didn't punish your mistake L2, which was too slow. He even punishes himself with giving you sente and giving him a cutting point at N3, which you are going to exploit later.]
;W[js];B[ls];W[qq]C[B.: This stone shouldn't be able to live. But since there is weakness to exploit (N3), it's possible. His sequence around L1 was not only gote, but also made an invasion thinkable, although closing the corner off from the left early should at least have made it safer!]

(;B[rq]C[R.: this one is wrong,is it?

B.: If he wanted to kill your stone, then yes. Unfortunately maybe this stone wasn't killable, and then this sequence, which leads to at least living himself safely, might still be one of the better sequences.]

(;W[nr];B[mq];W[rr];B[rp];W[qp];B[pp];W[pr];B[or];W[po]C[B.: I think, this doesn't work. (See variations!)]

(;B[pn]C[R.: this was blacks mistake,he should have played at S5 i think

B.: Yes, it was a mistake.];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[pq];W[qr];B[ps]
;W[sq]C[B.: This move was not really sente. This is the moment for him to reduce your center!]
;B[qs]C[B.: It has passed.];W[pm];B[on];W[jj]C[B.: You took a big lead. He should have reduced you earlier instead of letting you ruin his corner in sente.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq]C[R.: is there a way to kill black now?maybe with B3?

B.: No, I think, B3 doesn't work. But with e2 you can force him to start a ko-fight for life! (See variations! I hope I found the right moves - this is dan-stuff! ^_°)]

(;W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[bp];W[bo];B[br]
(;W[dr]C[B.: Not here!]
(;B[cs];W[ap]
(;B[bq]C[B.: Mistake. A3 was his last chance.]
(;W[aq]C[B.: No!];B[ar]C[B.: Now you still can kill him!]
(;W[ao];B[es]C[B.: Now he really lives.];W[fs];B[ds];W[cj];B[bj]
;W[ck];B[bk];W[bl];B[jc]
(;W[jb]C[B.: I think you could have captured that stone, but there might have been complications ...]
;B[ic];W[ib];B[id];W[le];B[kd];W[hb];B[ld]
(;W[oh]C[R.: probably my biggest mistake

B.: At least the one that was easiest to avoid! ^_°

Look at that top group. It's a one-move-problem: White to live. A rookie can read it out!

Maybe you have the same problem as I do: When you get excited, you start to play blitz. "Here!" "There!" "Take this!" I also lose a lot of stones because of that. But: When a group with little eyespace is surrounded like that, it is time to settle down and think calmly! First comes living, then you can blitz to other places! 

Oh, I would be happy myself about an antidote for blitz-disease ... ~_~]

;B[ei]C[R.: id thought this movw would just be a try for a tesuji of some kind and didnt see any potential in it

B.: This is one of the most joyful thing: To make a misguided attack run into defeat. Problem: You have to be careful! If your opponent tries something like this, don't underestimate it, or maybe you'll get stabbed from behind! Calmly read out a variation, which will lead safely to his defeat!]
;W[ej];B[fi]C[B.: Now simply guard - he can't get anywhere!]

B.: This is one I also might have overlooked ... ^_° At least it was not the game losing mistake, because you are behind 20 points even now. Letting his bold invasion stone cause havoc was the game losing move, because before it was very close.]

[ms][ns]C[Summary:

As every player you made some overplays and some slack moves here and there. I have tried to find them, so that you can avoid them in the future. But there are some things which are more important, because they seem to really trouble your play, although they are rather easy to avoid!

1.) Direction of play. Remember: Don't get too close to strong positions! Either it's dangerous or simply gote. K3 in the opening gave the initiative away. And then you defended the bottom when you should have increased your center. Always look, where you have real potential, don't automatically close off the edge or something like that! Finally you drove your opponent's lower right group into the center, which cost you at least 15 points.

2.) Read in critical situations. You let your upper group die without necessity because you played too hurriedly. Then you let the lower corner live for the same reason - there were several opportunities to kill him in just one move! Finally, and game deciding, you didn't read out, what his invading stone could do to your center. The big loss after that was a bit hard to see, you had to read 3 moves ahead. But the other things were quite easy, so I advice: Take your time, discipline yourself and try to read it out in critical situations!

Here are some books which could help you, all published by Kiseido. Do you know the Hebsacker-Verlag? If not, google it and take a look, they sell more go books than you could ever read, and a lot of equipment.

1.) 1001 Life and Death Problems. Richard Bozulich. A lot of problems which are not too hard, and with which you can develop your reading ability and discipline.

2.) Direction of play. Takeo Kajiwara. With this book you can improve your analytical ability. Where should I play next? In which direction does a stone radiate its power? What does the game ask from me now? Kajiwara gives answers.

3.) Positional Judgement. Cho Chikun. This book is mainly about counting. You really learn how to evaluate who is in lead, and by how much. It helps a lot in deciding what to do next. Also the author teaches some more direction of play.

I hope, this all will help you. Good luck in the future!])

(;W[eh];B[gi];W[gh];B[hi];W[ii]C[B.: Where will he get his eyes?
