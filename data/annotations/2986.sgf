;W[dr];B[cq];W[jp]C[This move is too loose.  J3 is the right move here.]
;B[nc]C[b11 I think, that without white stone at Q10 or near
(sanrensei on right side) to play black next move  hasami is
not good, but I had no another plan :(((];W[lc];B[qc]
(;W[qd]LB[pj:A]C[Never play this move unless you have a stone at around A.

Since you do not have a stone there, you can play like the variation.]
;B[pc];W[od];B[nb];W[me];B[qk]C[b19 That is result hasami w12 and it is bad for white

This is why R16 is a bad move for white.];W[qi]C[w20 I think it is not good, but what is better?

I cannot say it is a bad move.  You make territory this way.
The problem was what happened 5 moves ago.];B[qn];W[qo]C[w22 I want overconcentrate black...

I do not like this move.  All black wants is to live in your
area of influence.  You are guaranteeing him life this way. 
Also, your lower right corner still is not secure.];B[pn];W[np]
;B[jc]LB[ei:B][gc:A]C[This move by black is a little strange.  It seems like he is

points, but now I have chance - I thought :)

Yes this is a bad move by black.  Just playing at around A would
make a lot of territory and threaten your marked stones.];W[ol]

(;B[di]LB[ch:A]C[b93 May be better at A (C12)

No he needs to play where he did.  A does not work - plus this
gives him sente.];W[ch]C[w94 And now I think white has not bad position.
My analysis is - black has near 20 points in
top left + 10 in top right + 10 in bottom left +
10 in 2 groups in bottom right = near 50 points.
White has 10 points in  bottom right +10 in
2 groups in top and bottom right + near 10 in top
righ + some points arround b37-39 + komi = > 40.
And black has weak group in centre.
White has no very weak groups (I hoped :).
And white has good chance to increasing
territory in centre.
I thought sow :(((];B[gf]
(;W[ge]LB[gg:A][ji:B][ig:B]C[w96 May be better at A (G14) or B (near K12)?

Seems ok where you played.  Often cutting on one side means you
want to get the other side.];B[fe];W[gg];B[hf];W[hg];B[fg];W[ef]

Should play like variation...];B[ho];W[jm];B[jl];W[im];B[il]
C[This is painful for you.];W[mr];B[on];W[br]LB[hm:A]C[A is the biggest move.]
;B[qf];W[rf]C[w164 - that's all :(((
I had no time to put stone on the board before
next 10 minutes of canadian bejomi :(((
my time is over

You had many chances.  Look at the entire center-right part of
the board.  Not one group (black or white) was completely safe
during the last part of the game.

You need to play safer moves in the beginning so that you do
not have to look after weak stones later in the game.])
