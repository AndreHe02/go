AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Mark: Hello Gabor and Urmel,

My name is Mark Schlatter, and I will be reviewing your game.  This is the first time I have reviewed a game for both sides, so hopefully I will give good advice to both of you.  If you have questions or concerns, you can contact me at mschlat@gmail.com.  I am also mschlat on KGS and DGS.

Looking over the whole game, I see a lot of focus on the center, especially with the fighting extending from the lower right.  In go, you want to pay attention to the corner first, then sides, then center.  A common theme throughout this review will be to pay attention to the big areas in the corner and the side.

I will preface my comments with Mark:]PL[W];W[pn];B[qp]LB[op:B]
[oq:A]C[Mark: While this takes the corner, it can be small.  More common responses here are at A and B.  A takes the corner and allows for expansion on the bottom.  B leaves the corner open but puts more pressure on the white stone.

See the variation for why this move of black's is questionable.]
(;W[qk];B[qh]C[Mark: Good move by black --- white is now in a small space.]
;W[ri]CR[rm][sm][rn][sn]SQ[qk][pn]C[Gabaux: After the game is finished this seems to be a bit too low.
Q: Are there any alternatives?

Mark: Agreed.  You do not want to play on the second line in the beginning of the game unless it helps you with a corner.

The question here is if the marked white stones are in danger.  Black can easily move to the circled spots, so white does not have a base yet, but white can easily move out to the center.

I would play elsewhere at this point and approach another corner.  Perhaps at O3 to weaken black's corner stones.]
(;B[rh];W[rn]C[Mark: Again, a fairly passive move from white.  These stones are not in danger and there are bigger moves elsewhere (in approaching a corner).]
;B[on]LB[jc:C][mc:D][cj:B][mp:A]C[Gabaux: This seems to me rather questionable. Attaching makes the opponent srtonger.

Mark: True.  I would prefer a move like A, B , C, or D.  A has some of the same purpose as P6, but attacks from a distance.]
;W[om];B[nn];W[nm]C[Gabaux: This seemed to me a good move.

Mark: It's not bad, but look at the influence black is building up at the bottom.]
(;B[mm]C[Mark: See the variation.];W[mp]C[Gabaux: Is this the good direction to play? Are there any alternatives?

Mark: I think this works, but I am concerned about your followups.]
;B[mo]LB[kp:A]C[Mark: Black helps white by attaching here.  I would rather attack by playing around A.]
(;W[nq]LB[lp:A]C[Mark: Very passive.  You are giving black the option of sealing you in with M4.  

I would move at A with the option later on of cutting black.  See the variation.]
;B[np]
(;W[lq]C[Gabaux: I made this move to secure some small territory.

Mark: Again very passive.  See the variations.];B[lp];W[kq]
C[Gabaux: I wanted to keep initiative.

Mark: Good in theory, but now you have to respond to black's capture.]
;B[mq];W[mr]C[This is a typical situation where i always wonder whether to fill the ko in or find a better move. Usually i fill the ko, because when white takes there are a weaknesses,
well this looks quite safe even when W takes

Mark: Ko is almost useless in the early game.  Best just to fill in.]
(;B[nr];W[mp];B[oq];W[mq];B[ip]LB[jc:B][cj:A]C[Gabaux: I could not find black's reason behind this move.
urmel: I don't really remember because it looks now rather useless. Probably I wanted to prevent encirclement and reach some kind of connection to the left. Perhaps with a 1 space jump? Better no jump at all in this situation

Mark: It's not a bad move for black.  The white stones at the bottom can live (especially with the atari at P2), but they are small.  This restricts white's options and helps black build up influence.

However, moves at A and B are still bigger.];W[ir]C[Mark: A low move for white.  Locally, I would rather take the outside move at L4 to move out to the center.]
;B[pi]LB[oj:A]C[Here I tried to keep your share of territory small but in the end it was much bigger than planned and I felt lucky for keeping the 'wall'
Perhaps it would have been better to try to secure some territory somewhere

Mark: Here you have to measure potential.  The white group on the right looks alive, but small.  It can move out at A or black's move, but these are moves to the center, where you don't get much territory.  Again, white can take much more territory along the sides.

Black is better off taking a side move.];W[nk]LB[fc:A][nc:D]
[cf:B][cn:C]C[Mark: Same response for white.  This gets some more territory, but not as much as playing an approach move on the corners.]
;B[mk];W[nj]C[Gabaux: White builds some territory and attempts to break through black's stones.
Q: Are there other possibilities?

Mark: See my earlier comment for white.];B[ni]SQ[qh][rh][pi]
C[Mark: Notice how black is getting a wall here facing the top.  If this continues, black can take a bunch of territory.]
;W[oj]CR[ok]TR[nj][nk]C[Mark: This shape is called the "empty triangle" --- three stones surrounding an empty point.  It is very bad shape and almost always a bad move.  

I am guessing white is making this move to secure eyespace for the white group, but I believe that's unnecessary --- white appears to have plenty of room to live.  Locally, a move at N10 is better.  Globally, corner or side moves are better.]
;B[mi]C[Gabaux: It seems black is loosing the initiative.

Mark: This can be great for black, if you convert this influence into points.]
;W[oi]C[Mark: This move (and move 37) help black solidify the wall.  These are more midgame and endgame moves.  The corner and side moves are larger.]
;B[oh];W[pj];B[kp]C[Mark: Not a crucial move, but you are setting up the potential for a huge moyo (enclosure) in the center.]
;W[jq]C[Gabaux: White keeps on pushing.

Mark: A passive move --- if need be, white can connect at K2.]
;B[dj]SQ[oh][qh][rh][mi][ni][pi][mk][mm][mo][ip][kp][lp]C[Gabaux: Black secures the base, but this seems to me ill-timed. Leaves an opportunity for white take the lead.

Mark: At this point, I think black has a commanding lead.  White has two small groups that are alive, but have little chance of influencing the rest of the game.  Black has huge influence (the marked stones) and a living group in the lower right.

Note to Urmel: you might consider playing on the third line here instead of the fourth.  The third line is better for making a base.]
(;W[gq]CR[gp]C[Gabaux: White keeps building territory.
Q: Were the marked position (G4) too risky? I considered it for a while.

Mark: Yes, you want to play at G4, but then black can easily cut (see variation).  White should focus on the big areas here.  I would approach the upper left.]
;B[gp]C[Mark: Good move by black.];W[jm]CR[mn][lo][no][oo][op]
[pp][pq][qq][rq][qr][rr]C[Gabaux: This was an attempt to take away the possibilty of two eyes.

Mark: The black group here is in no danger of dying.  First off, it's huge.  Second, these stones are (mostly) connected to the lower right corner, where black can easily develop eyes.]
;B[il]LB[jc:B][fq:A]C[Mark: An unnecessary move by black (that will only strengthen white).

I like the hane at A or the side move at B.];W[jl];B[jn];W[kn]
C[Gabaux: Cutting, I thought it was important.

Mark: I'm confused here.  White is not cutting black.  On the contrary, white is creating opportunities for black to cut at L7.  There are all sorts of ways black can cause havoc here.

Locally, I believe J7 is better.  Globally, approaching a corner is better.]
(;B[jo];W[jp]C[Gabaux: Cutting again.

Mark: I don't see a good way for white to do well here.];B[km]
;W[lm];B[kl];W[ll];B[kk];W[ml];B[ln];W[mn];B[ko];W[lk];B[mj]
;W[jk]
(;B[jj];W[kj];B[kn];W[ij]C[Gabaux: White attempts to cut in black territory.]
;B[ji];W[er]SQ[jk][jl][jm]C[Gabaux: White aims for territory.

Mark: But note that black can kill the marked white stones.  (See variation.)

Again, this is not the largest move.];B[ik];W[im];B[hm];W[in]
;B[hn];W[lj]LB[fc:A][jc:C][nc:B][cq:D]C[Gabaux: White seems to loose initiative.

Mark: This is a move to save one white stone.  Still not as big as any of the marked moves.]
;B[ki]LB[jc:A]C[Mark: Slow on black's part.  A is huge here.]
;W[li];B[lh];W[ii]C[Gabaux: This move did not seemed very good in retrospect.
Q: Are there any alternatives in this situation?

Mark: Any of the corner or side moves.  Your retrospect analysis is good --- any time you are playing where you have few liberties (only three here), you are probably making a bad choice.]
;B[ih]
(;W[hi]C[Mark: Empty triangle again.  Look at the variation.]
;B[hh];W[gi];B[gh];W[fi];B[fh];W[fk]C[Gabaux: This move proved to be unfortunate, was too risky.
Q: What are the better moves in this case?

Mark: Yes, now black has a huge wall facing the top and is very happy.  I would have abandoned these stones and played near the corners or sides.  Also, the variation at 79 still works.]
;B[fj]LB[ei:A][dm:B]C[Mark: Too close to white.  You can kill the stones but better to attack from afar.  The hane at A is good, as is the extension at B.]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[ek];B[gj];W[cq];B[cp]C[Looking on the result, I was much to careless here, gave away the corner
The two black stones only work with a counterpart, which is missing. I feel I should have invested here

Mark: True --- but you can exchange this small area for the huge area at the top.  It is much larger.]
;W[bp]
(;B[pr]C[Mark: An unnecessary move for black.  See 2nd variation.]
;W[oo]LB[fc:B][jc:C][nc:A]C[Gabaux:  Are there better ideas?

Mark: Any of the marked moves.   If black plays correctly, the P5 stone presents no danger.]
;B[no]
(;W[po]
(;B[mm]C[Mark: Much, much better to just connect.  White gains here by being able to cut the groups apart at P4.]
;W[nl];B[dh]C[So far I was rather happy

Mark: If this is black speaking, I agree!  Black has huge influence along the top.]
;W[kh];B[hj];W[em]TR[bp]C[Mark: A good move, given that black did not respond to the marked stone.  Black either needs to connect the two stones at C4 to the group in the middle left or the H6 stones.]
(;B[dk]C[Mark: See the variations.];W[dl]C[Gabaux: This seems to me a rather questionable move after the game...

Mark: This is good for white --- it provides possible eyespace.]
;B[cl];W[cm];B[bl];W[bm]
(;B[fm]SQ[cp][dp]C[Mark: Another attaching move that helps white.  Black's best move locally is to connect the marked stones to the center group.  Once that option is lost, white gains a huge corner from stones that could have been killed.]

;B[nh];W[lg];B[lf];W[kf];B[jg];W[mf];B[le];W[ng]C[Mark: This is good work by white to move into black's territory.  Note, however, that corner approaches are still valid.]
;B[ne]LB[qf:A]C[Mark: A little too focused on the center --- a move like A is better in protecting side territory.]

(;W[ab]
(;B[be];W[ed];B[fc];W[ec]C[Mark: And now white has made the great move of entering the center (black's big area) while having secure eyespace in the corner.]
;B[ee]LB[hc:A][df:B]C[Mark: Attaching to white only creates more opportunities for white to cut.  Black is better off making moves from afar.  I particularly like A and B.]

Mark: Let's find out!

Yep, I think the variations show that white can exploit cuts otherwise.]

Mark: No reason for black to play here.  The group is safe.]
;C[White: 72 territories + 13 prisoners + 0.5 komi = 85.5
Black: 63 territories + 16 prisoners = 79
Result: W+6.5

Mark: Okay, I will try and give some general comments here.

1) First off, if anything I have said or demonstrated does not make sense, please let me know.  I will be happy to explain any terminology or concepts.

2) I have regularly stated in this review that both players need to look to large moves --- moves that approach the corners (for white) and moves along the side (for both sides).  There is a tendency when playing go to move wherever your opponent has played.  Sometimes that's necessary if your group is in danger.  But often you can make a bigger move elsewhere.  Try and get in the habit of looking for larger moves.

3) Black had this game won and then lost it because of the misuse of influence (the huge walls around move 85).  Once you have that influence, you can make safe moves along the sides or corners and force your opponent to live small. 

4) White made a number of small moves along the bottom and right hand side.  I know it's tough to leave a group if you are unsure of its life, but once you are sure, do not play next to it.  Look to big open areas where black has not played.

5) Keep on getting games reviewed.

I hope this was helpful!
