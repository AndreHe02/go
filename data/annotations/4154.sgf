;W[qf]
(;B[oe]LB[fc:A][jc:B][lc:C]C[Usually this move is played, when Black wants to avoid being shut in. But this is not the case here, so tenuki would have been better. I think the biggest move is A. If Black wants to develop the shimari I would play B.  Even C is better than the game. Look at the tewari analysis in the variation.]
;W[jc];B[lc]LB[cf:A]TR[oe]C[Since Black has already stored up strenght with the marked stone, M17 looks a bit narrow. A looks better now.]
;W[gc]LB[cc:C][cd:B][cf:A][ql:E][no:D][pr:F]C[Maybe here something better than K16. Maybe C16

Thats right. K16 makes Black even more overconcentrated. Good moves for Black are now A to F.]
;B[jd];W[id];B[kd];W[ie]LB[ce:A]C[A is bigger.];B[cc];W[dc]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb]C[I think the game is even.]
;W[lq]C[This is not very a severe attack on the marked stone, since the white corner is open. Rather it is a reducing move for the black moyo.]

(;B[qq]C[This is premature. I would secure the black moyo first. (see var)]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[qp];B[rr];W[rq];B[qr];W[lo]LB[jn:A][jr:B]C[Uncomfortable for Black. White can now reduce the black moyo either at A or B. A move at A would also expand the white moyo.]
;B[jn];W[jr];B[kr]C[Although this keeps the black moyo intact, it hurts to make White so strong.]
;W[kq];B[ir];W[jq];B[iq];W[np]LB[ip:A]C[Now a cut at A remains.]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[sq];W[og]
(;B[ok]C[As it turns out, this is to deep. I would prefer to make a territorial contest of it by playing on the border of the moyos.

;W[lj];B[ng];W[nf];B[mg];W[of]C[Now it is clear that the Black territories will be hurt by the white attack, so Black has not really achieved a good result.]

C[The marked stones hurt Black very much.];B[im];W[il];B[hh]
;W[ig];B[ii]LB[fj:A]TR[ji][hj]C[Superfluos. A wasted move. The connection of the marked stones was secure. With A Black could have lead his group to safety.]
;W[hg];B[gh];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[gg]LB[fj:A]C[Blacks center group has no eyes and no connection yet. This is not the time to punk around. Better seeking a connection with somethng like A. As long as Black has this weak group he can't open the endgame.]
;W[gk];B[gm]
(;W[hm]C[aji keshi. There a various ways to destroy this territory. for example (see var).]
;B[hn];W[gj];B[hf];W[if];B[kk];W[kl];B[no]C[Black has not a single eye and tenukies. That can't be good.]
;W[lm]LB[ll:A][nm:B]C[B protects the cut at A too and puts more pressure on Black.]
;B[qj];W[pj];B[oj];W[qk];B[ql];W[rj];B[pl];W[mp]LB[nr:A]C[Locally A is correct shape. But White should continue his attack on the left side.]
;B[nm];W[re];B[rd]C[Both are playing endgame in the middle of a lethal attack. Reminds me of the ads during an action-movie on TV. ;-).]
;W[gi]C[h11 is a must i think

If H11 does something for connecting or getting eye shape it would be a must. Else it is just an (although big) endgame move.]
;B[qh];W[rh];B[pm]LB[ol:A]C[Aah, the first eye at A appears.]
;W[hi]LB[qn:A]C[I would like to see White playing A, saying "show me your 2nd eye please." I can't see it.]
;B[qn];W[qo];B[on]C[Black lives now. With a lot of luck.];W[nr]
LB[cj:A]C[A is very much bigger.];B[po]C[Small. Not necessary to live.]
;W[is];B[hs];W[js];B[gr]C[Now the question is what to do for black side, if possible to do something.]
;W[ek]LB[bh:A][cj:B]C[Threatens to cut. But Black can comfortable connect with A therefore I would prefer White B here.]

(;B[ec]LB[fb:A]C[Mistake. Correct is A (see var).];W[ed];B[dj]
;W[eh]LB[ci:A]C[A would be better];B[ml];W[ll];B[jb];W[ib];B[kb]
;W[bg];B[dh]C[This loses the game. Black has to connect first, also White is leading by a small margin then.]

;W[jm]C[Black has played a reasonable fuseki, but then he invaded when a reduction was called for. Mr. Bouzolich says in the foreword of his book  "501 opening problems": If you have a weak group with no eye on the board, count minus 20 points for you (minus 10 in case of 1 eye), that is the profit the opponent makes by harrasing it. So if you invade and you can't settle the group quickly you have to destroy more than 20 points of territory to make a gain. (These numbers are only thumb rules). On the other hand if you play on the borders of the potential territories you expand yours, while you destroy the opponents points. Thats the same kind of fun as making territory by attacking. In short: don't invade, while you can reduce.]

(;B[kl];W[ml];B[di]LB[fb:A][re:B][so:C]C[By playing in this fashion Black reduces the white moyo while simultaneously expanding his own. Black has also good endgame moves at A-C so Whites territory is not as big as it looks.]
