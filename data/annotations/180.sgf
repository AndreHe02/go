[I dun think U shld play here, it's like a dame  (neutral pt), the previous move will become bad (must well play here  during the previous move).  
U misjudged the marked White stones for a weak piece.

Let's argue this way...

U got 2 marked stones and White got 7 marked stones...

White is certainly stronger here, so U shld play 'a' to strenghthen  Urself 1st.

If White 1 2 play this "dame-like" move next, then U can just take the  stone  at 'b'.    
The next move at 'c' is OK, but I feel tt Var 2 is  better.]

>From wat I see, U shld learn how to

1) Play thicker as a form of defence      cum potential attack later on.

2) Sacrifice stones and not drawing      them out.

Hope u have enjoyed this reviewed game.
