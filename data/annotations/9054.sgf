C[Hi, I'm Riani and I'll be reviewling your game. I'll answer both your thoughts and a few other observations. If you have any other questions please don't heasitate to ask, or challenge me to a game (i'm Riani on most servers).]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[nc];W[qf]
(;B[kc]LB[jd:a][pb:b]C[This is Ok, but I personally prefer A or B, especially A considering how you continued.]
;W[pj];B[dj]C[Your fuseki is well developed, and you have decent defense, but your biggest issue is  not taking the fight to the opponent on your terms.]
;W[jp]
(;B[gp]LB[nq:a][gq:b]C[I prefer leaping in at A, or else taking territory by going a line lower to B.]
;W[cc]C[VipassanaMan: Never encountered this before.... can't see how this is good for white?
~~~
This can be done, although in this particular situation it's not 100% wise.]
;B[cd]C[only this direction will work for black here.];W[dc]
;B[ec]LB[cf:a]C[Be careful not to play this with a white stone at A.]

(;W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ed]LB[ce:a][cf:b]
C[If you want to defend, take A or B instead, and simultaneously defend against an endgame move.]

(;W[cq]C[VipassanaMan: And again!];B[cp]C[Correct direction again.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr]
(;B[gr]LB[bq:a][nq:b][qn:c][pb:d][qc:e]C[This really is a tiny move. Prefer A locally here, as it is sente for you
This is also a good time to begin taking the fight to the opponent. B or C, you could  even trade D for E first at this point.]
;W[bp]
(;B[bq];W[br];B[bo]TR[bq][br]C[The trade of the triangled stones doesn't affect the value of the corner. Just play here first.]
;W[aq]C[This is a big turning point in the game. After this, you both start playing a lot "Faster" moves, that is not so close together.]

(;B[gj]TR[dj]SQ[be][cd][dd][ed][ec][gc][fc][gp][fq][eq][dp]
[cp][bo]LB[nq:a][qn:b][pb:c][qc:d]C[VipassanaMan: Too close to my influence seems to me - i basically handed half the board to white.
~~~
Each of thse stones is the perfect distance from the walls. Whie this  might be a smaller move than some others, it is still a correct distance. I prefer A or B here.
You are absolutely correct. You have plenty of influence, now you need to use it to reach out.
A or B. this would have also been a good time to trade C for D or invade at D.]
;W[gm];B[em]C[Ok response, I supose, but these moves on the inside of your wall aren't  gaining you much.
You could persue a mutual damage strategey and ignore this and attack, and return to this floating group later.]
;W[im];B[gg]LB[nq:a][qn:b]C[This area is already secure. Better to play at A or B.]
;W[jj]
(;B[bj]SQ[jj]LB[ne:a][nq:b][qn:c]C[VipassanaMan: To stop an invasion.... but unnecessary?
~~
Yup. you don't need this at all. You're so thick on both sides that any invasion would be rediculous.
A is now viable because his last stone (squred) showed intention to make a massive moyo. Stop him before he starts.]
;W[kg];B[jf]LB[nq:a][ne:b]C[While I understand the idea behind this, long term defense is not an option when you're behind. You must attack at A or B. Complicate the game. Make him play to your strengths, and you pick the battlefield.]
;W[kf];B[je]TR[nc][kc][jf][gj][em][gp][pd][kf][kg][jj][im][jp]
C[A breif lesson in efficiency: 
What you have behind the wall is almost unquestionably yours. What he has though is bigger, and he got it by not being afraid to reach a little farther.]
;W[ne]LB[nq:a]C[The only way in now is through the bottom (A)]
;B[pb];W[qc]
(;B[nq]C[VipassanaMan: 3-3 better I think now
~~ This is still ok if you handle it right.];W[pr]C[This is very passive, although it does seal in the corner.]
;B[kq];W[jq];B[jr];W[ir]
(;B[kr]LB[js:a]C[A is better to live.];W[hq]TR[gr]C[Sacrifice thsi stone. Life for the lower RH group is more important.]

(;B[gq];W[lp]C[This hurts.];B[lq];W[mp];B[mq];W[np]LB[qn:a]
C[You now have no way into his moyo, and a play at A is like looking down a dragon's jaws.]
;B[oq];W[pq];B[or]TR[ks][lr][nr][ms]C[This group should live.
There is the possibility of an eye at every triangled point.]
;W[ls]TR[nr]C[The triangled eye can still be saved, and when this stone dies, you''ll have the other eye.]

(;B[os]C[too slow.]
(;W[ps];B[mr]C[The right spot, but a bit later than it should have been.]
;W[hh];B[gh];W[hg];B[hf];W[jg]CR[jp][lp][mp][np][pp]C[I would resign about here.
The influence of white's wall has sealed off the grand majority of the moyo, and any invasion in its shadow is likeely to not be able to turn the game around at this point.]
;B[qk]C[VipassanaMan: I'm already maybe 30 points behind, needed an invasion to live..... it didn't happen!

VipassanaMan: I'm still pretty bad at invading... I have no idea where I should have started - was this a bad place?

~~
Not a bad place, rather a bad time. it is easier to prevent your opponent from getting something than to take it from them. Spend the earlier moves in htis area and it would have been much better.]

Yes, there is no other long-term option for you here.];W[qj]
