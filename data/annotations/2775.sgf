;W[pp];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[gc]LB[ec:A]C[This is generally considered too far. Though it would be difficult for black to exploit the thinness of white's position immediately, the weakness at a may come back to haunt you later. It is better to play G17 at F17.]
;B[dj]
(;W[qf]C[Since black has developed a large moyo on the left, it seems more prudent to extend in that direction, to curtail further expansion. I like somewhere around F3. [See variations.\]]
;B[qh];W[of]C[Locally, the centre is not important. This move also seems too far to effectively negate black's influence on the left. I would favour simple settling in the corner with R17.]

a: See the variation.];B[qg];W[pf];B[rf];W[qi];B[ri];W[rh];B[rg]
;W[rj];B[nq]LB[pg:A]C[So black's moyo is growing, and white still has a cut at a, providing the ladder works for black. It doesn't yet, but black can play a ladder breaker somewhere around J4, and further expand his framework.]

(;W[fq]TR[mq]C[Right now, the bottom is not so interesting. The triangled stone is slow, and therefore neither side can hope for much development here. Just one line higher seems more logical.]
;B[cn]

a: C3 is a bit unreasonable, because of black C6.];B[dq];W[dr]

(;B[cl];W[co]C[This pushing does nothing but hurt white. Black answered poorly and so white got more than he should have.]

;B[kk]
(;W[gk]C[When dealing with an invasion like this, it is better to give black as little room as possible. Don't expand your moyo while an enemy is inside it, unless the expanding move is sente (in which case it is called a leaning attack). Here, black can comfortably ignore G9.]
;B[ki]
(;W[lh];B[li];W[mj];B[lj];W[ll]C[g: I tried to make the black stones heavy.]
;B[lk]C[Black, at this point, is basically out. You can attempt a leaning attack around F11, but black is likely to ignore it and escape. At this point, it might be better simply to defend your remaining territory at O9.]

a: Black seems to have forgotten that he is not out yet. I think your best move is at J11. He will have to make life within your moyo, which is never easy.]

1. The O17 group is quite strong and white can expect fierce opposition to an extension that comes too close.

2. The lingering E17 aji may complicate things if a fight were to break out along the top.]
