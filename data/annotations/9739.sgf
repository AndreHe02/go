C[Thank you so much for reviewing my game!

review: hi, ill comment both sides but keep focus on white / your questions. sorry for spelling mistakes but i'm not native engish.]
;B[cd];W[pp];B[pc];W[dp];B[pf];W[jc]LB[pc:A][pf:B]C[I thought this was the right move because it limits his extension from the upper right - not sure if the Q14 move can be called a shimari though.

review: yes, black A and B has sealed off the corner. At this stage of game it's a very strong formation.

In general you should keep away from strong formations ( both, your own and your opponent )

Problem with that stone: black can use it -> see variation:]

(;B[fd]C[review: right spirit but to high as white can slip under.]
;W[mc];B[hc]C[review: thats why black 7 should have been on the 3rd line. -> it black 9 could be used to hammering on white and seal it off.]
;W[jp]LB[nf:B]C[I play sanrensei (poorly) a lot, so I thought this was a decent move, but not completely sure.

review: i don't like the small white formation at the top which is pressed from both sides. I would have spend a stone arround B to prevent black from sealing it off.

Your move however is a good move; but a bit too late.];B[gp]
;W[fq]LB[nf:B][cm:A]C[Wasn't sure exactly how to answer here, but I thought this move would enclose my corner a bit more and make it a bit harder for him to make a base here.

review: 
the black stone looks weird to me as there is much more open space on the board to play. It does not attack the corner (should have been on the 3rd line for attacking) and there is no much room to make life.

Each stone should have a clear plan behind. I don't see a plan behind the black stone. For white: i would have played at A to seal the corner. Black is too high to attack -> your corner is secure with a stone at A.

B would have been also nice.];B[iq];W[jq]C[review: ok];B[fp]
;W[eq];B[dn]LB[cn:A]C[review:

a white stone arround A would have been nice now. 
Black tries to seal white.];W[co]LB[di:A][eo:B]C[Is everything okay in this corner so far?

review:

Black plan seem to be "seal white" -> you stone does not complain. 

If black seals you off, it gets a huge mojo at A

I would have played at B:

- it seperates the 2 black groups ( quite difficult to reconnect )
- gives white access to the center,
- puts pressure on the lower black group which has no base.]
;B[cn];W[ci]LB[jc:A]C[Here I was trying to stop him from getting a huge moyo, and I saw that I would have space for a two point extension in either direction.

review:

looks exact like the stone you played earlier at A.
It can be used by black: 
- you get a (small) life
- black gets huge influence];B[ck]C[review:

as expected];W[cf]LB[bb:B][lb:F][rb:A][bg:E][bl:G][br:C][rr:D]
C[So that's what I did. I thought at least his group around C6 has an extension that isn't the most efficient, so not all bad?


review:

ok lets have an inventory right now:

Black: 2 secure corners: A and B with points
White 1 secure corner C 1 open corner with less poins than black

White: 2 "maybe life" formations which are pressed on both sides by quite strong groups; black can still hammer on both to get huge influence.

Black: one living formation on the side (G) which looks much stronger than the 2 white ones.

I would bet on black at this stage.];B[bf]LB[eg:A]C[review: very bad move for black:  attacking at arround A would seal it off and also threaten to kill it later.]
;W[bg];B[be];W[df]C[review: black gained nothing; white looks more stable now.]
;B[pi];W[ql]LB[qq:A]C[Here I just wanted to make a bit of a double wing and also threaten to come in under his stones.

review: ok. ... but black still can invade at A; so you should place a stone yourself there as soon as possible.]
;B[qk];W[rk]LB[rg:B][pk:C][qk:F][ll:A][pl:D][ql:E]C[Maybe standing up here would have been better?

review:

1st: "have a plan" 

one plan could be "build up area at A (or close to A) 

The area at B is stable and strong; don't attack it; you will gain nothing.

C or D would have been better here it also defends E / attacks F but also aims to the center.]
;B[qj];W[pl]LB[he:E][mf:B][ej:D][rk:A][eo:C]C[Well, I ended up doing it in the end anyway...

review: good move; but A dosn't do anything here; so it's kind of wasted -> should have been somewhere else (B, C, D, E)]
;B[mo]LB[km:A]C[review:

bad move: try to catch it ... there is no room for black to make life.]
;W[mp]LB[km:A][mq:B]C[Not sure if this is the right answering move. I'm always unsure when to play contact moves and when not to.

review:
in 90% of all cases attaching is wrong as it strenthen the stone you are attaching to -> there is no area at the bottom black can run  into -> seal it with A 


if you need to connect (you don't need here); don't attach -> B would have been better.]

(;B[on];W[qn]C[So here I decided to hedge my bets and not do two contact moves in a row...

review: ok.];B[oo];W[op]LB[ml:A][km:B]C[review:

i see you plan to secure the corner; but i still think it should have been better to put pressure from the other side A or B

->there is no space for black to make 2 eyes.];B[ol];W[lp]LB[ok:B]
[ol:A][km:C]C[black A tries to connect; if black succeed there is no worry anymore about life.

Try to keep them seperated at B (tough) or slip to the center C 
make the wall at A black is building less efficient];B[lo]C[review: too slow]
;W[in]LB[mc:C][df:D][mf:E][kl:A][jp:B]C[I saw him getting a lot of outside influence here so I wanted to at least punch a hole in it.

review: right spirit; but too slow 
a stone at A is hard to catch ( can connect to A, B, C ) but reduces the area at A.

If Black plays at A now, it claims area. ( however E is bigger )]
;B[gn];W[ne]LB[mf:A][nf:B][ng:C]C[Trying to push his moyo down and expand a little.

review:

good move, but too slow.
A or B would have been better. 

Black cann go to C now claiming more area putting some pressure on the white group. Does not work with a white stone at A or B.]
;B[oe]C[review:

attaching is bad.];W[nf]C[review: very good.];B[nc];W[md];B[nd]
;W[jg];B[gl];W[ej];B[el]C[review: too slow];W[og]LB[ni:A]C[review:

seems like a peek but it isn't as black is strong on both sides.

A builds up white territory reducing the black ones.];B[pg]
LB[ni:A];W[ie]LB[nj:A]C[I was glad I got to play this move.

A is much much better. 

your move is passive; it does not attack; does not force black to answer.

you gain some points; black gains sente.];B[ff];W[eg];B[gg]
;W[bj]LB[hj:B][nj:A]C[review:

i dont think the white group can be killed 

if you worry about you group; running to the center would gain more.

A would still be a nice move];B[bk];W[hh];B[lj];W[lh]C[Here I was defending what looked biggest to me.]
;B[ni];W[km]C[But I still wanted to be able to punch inward from this side too.]
;B[lm];W[il]LB[kl:B][lm:A]C[review:

i don't understand that move; after A i would expect B as it forces black to play again here.]
;B[jj];W[fk]LB[dd:D][sh:B][fl:E][fm:F][bo:C][hq:A]C[review:

that move does nothing. seems like a peek; but what happens if you get a stone at E? ... black plays F and that's it.


I marked some big points white could use to gain some points.]

(;B[fl];W[hj]LB[gh:A][nk:B][en:C]C[Just continuing to punch inward.

review:

what does this move do? 

- C and B are secure with poins; black does not need to connect both groups so your move does not seperate.
- there is no area for black -> nothing reduced here
- it's not building up area for white, as black can invade easy at A.]
;B[hk];W[gj];B[ik];W[jl];B[kl];W[kn];B[ko]
(;W[jo]LB[kk:C][ll:A][ln:B]C[review:

much to passive! 

there are a lot of cuts to play whith could reduce the black area to nothing.]
;B[ll];W[sh]C[Thought I was doing a monkey jump here, just to reduce. I guess the stone at R10 is what makes this not playable? Little did I know, this would be one of the moves that would lose me the game!

review:

no, the move works!];B[rj]LB[rl:A]C[So here I saw it would work, and retreated.

review:

you are afraid because the cut at A? ... it does not work!]

(;W[rl];B[sj];W[ib]LB[hq:A]C[Now I'm just searching for endgame moves that gain a point or two and require a response.

review: still A works well.];B[hb]
(;W[ir]LB[hq:A]C[review: NO, A! ...];B[hq];W[ge];B[fe];W[gh]

;B[pm];W[qm];B[pn];W[ii];B[mh];W[mg]C[Another spot where maybe I lost a point or two - did I respond to this correctly? Or would M13 have been better?

review:  it's ok];B[lg];W[kh];B[mf]
(;W[lf]LB[ng:A]C[review: A! 

black cannot win this. (see variations)];B[ng];W[me];B[mg]
(;W[kf]LB[kg:A]C[review:

too cautious: the cut's if played at A do not work];B[id];W[jd]
C[Now we're in full endgame mode - let me know if you see anything awful.]
;B[he];W[hf];B[hd];W[if]LB[hg:A]C[review: why not A?];B[gf]

(;W[fg]LB[dd:A]C[review:

it seems like you are playing very passive from now on.

You don't have to answer every move. Even if a move from black requires an answer, there might be a bigger point black has to answer.

Your move does not do anything. Black cannot invade here (either you block or cut off if black tries to. So take sente and use it!]

review:

for me it looks like you don't like to fight. especial at the end you didn't look for points to reduce black territory but defendig your own. There where some spots where you could reduce blacks area while loosing none or very little of your own.

Next: you need a plan; some goal you like to archive. Just playing stones that are looking good in the actual situation is not enough.]
