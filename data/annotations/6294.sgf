C[hello, and thanks for reviewing my game!



I played this game against my friend and i played black.  I usually lost but i improved on my opening a little.

Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I've preceded all my comments with my name.

I think you won in large part because White played very passively, without any ideas.  On numerous occasions, White attacked, only to stop suddenly and without any good reason for stopping.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[eq];B[pj];W[nc];B[pf]C[Did i answer correctly?

Ted: This is a perfectly good answer.  Some people will suggest that because White will be happy to play K16 in response, Black might wish to try the pincer attack instead.  But either is fine.]
;W[kc];B[jp]C[Ted: You're playing too many moves on the fourth line.  In general, you should strive for balance: stones on the fourth line are good for influence (towards the center), while those on the third line are better for territory.  I think either this move, or the stone at Q14, would have been better on the third line.]
;W[cp];B[cf]TR[cp][eq]SQ[cj][dj]C[i think that i could have attacked somewhere else

Ted: As a rule, when a player plays the shimari (the marked White stones) in a corner, an extension to the middle of the side (ie, the two marked empty points) is strong, so Black should probably play there before White can.

Note, however, that this gives White the decision of which way to push Black.]
;W[cj];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[hd];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc]C[did I play this out well?

Ted: So far, so good.]
(;B[ef]C[Was this good jugement or should i have did something else

Ted: I think I would have played at D15 instead.  Your move leaves a potential weakness in your position if White can play at D15.]
;W[pm];B[np];W[nm];B[nj]C[was i susposed to do this because i read a book that said that i should try to keep my opponents stones separated

Ted: Absolutely.  Having said that, I don't like White's move at Q7.  I think White should have played at Q6 instead, or perhaps even just invaded in the corner immediately.]
;W[hq];B[lm]TR[nm][pm]SQ[lp]C[was this a good capping move

Ted: This move makes it harder for White to get eyes with the marked stones, as well as to try to split you at M4.  Having said that, I don't think White has been playing this sequence very well.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[ob];B[qm]C[was thisreally nessesary?

Ted: I think I would have looked at playing in a different part of the board first; perhaps playing around C8 or O15.  Keep in mind that the object of the game isn't to kill your opponent's stones; it's to limit your opponent to smaller life than you.]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[Ted: Good!  Don't give White any potential to connect to the stones above.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[ps];B[rr]C[I think i killed this correctly, did I

Ted: The general rule in life and death situations is that you're not trying to take your opponent's liberties; you're trying to take your opponent's *eyespace*.  As such, you did a good job.]

(;W[qr];B[rq];W[po]C[Ted: I think White would have been better-served by playing P5 instead, threatening the cut at P4.]
;B[qo];W[rs];B[mk]C[i dont ' think this was necessary.

could i have pincered on the left side

Ted: Playing on another part of the board is clearly a good option.]
;W[ho];B[jn]C[was doing this a good idea?

Ted: I think it's a bit defensive.  However, White has been helping you by playing passively and giving you a lot of territory in the bottom right.]
;W[hm];B[ik];W[fl];B[cm]C[did i do this well?

Ted: The attack should have come earlier, I think.   Now, it's going to be much harder to get life.  You saved a lot of the stones, only because White made things easy on you by ignoring this part of the board at critical moves and letting you connect everything together.

I should point out, however, that the objective of an invasion isn't always to make a stable, independent group; often, simply reducing your opponent's territory by connecting out to stones already on the board is just as good.]

;W[ck];B[bn];W[ak];B[dh]C[Ted: Watch that White doesn't cut you at D11, or at D8.

I would have looked to something like D6 instead, with a view to following up at either D11 or F10.]
;W[cn]C[Ted: One of White's few good ideas in this sequence.]
;B[dn];W[co];B[al];W[bj];B[el]C[Ted: This is a nice move.];W[fk]
;B[fm];W[nh]C[Ted: Why White decided to tenuki is beyond me.]
;B[ph];W[di]C[Ted: Finally!];B[ei]
(;W[hf]C[Ted: White should have kept attacking you, at E10.  See the variations.]
;B[fj]C[Ted: And now your group on the left side will live.

I've included a few more comments where you've made unneccesary moves, but here, the game is efectively over.]

In your own personal opinion, how would  you rank me in skill?
