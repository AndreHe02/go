C[Hi,

I played that game with white and I can't figure exactly where are my mains mistakes.
Thanks for the comments !

Arnauld (aka milouz)];B[pd];W[dp];B[op];W[dd];B[qo]LB[qq:a]
C[Milouz : this appears to me like an odd way to play for black in the corner. But I really do not know who to deal with that kind of play. I think black could also have played in R4, safest.

dv: Indeed Black did not take the corner efficiently. It is possible to invade at A but it is even better to keep it in reserve, until either the invasion is bound to become successful or Black will defend at A, turning his three stones overconcentrated.]
;W[nd];B[pg];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[pe]C[Milouz : I think R15 would have been better because black gives me place to invade, like in the other corner.

dv: R16 would actually be best ...];W[jc]LB[qb:a][dj:b]C[... precisely because you can take sente now instead of extending. This move is equivalent to A for stability of the group, so not urgent. I would have played the big point B instead.

If Black had played R16, then A would give less stability and 12 would be a good move. You can figure this out for yourself.]
;B[pk]C[Milouz : black seems a bit over concentrated and that it still be could be invaded. But I missed it, as you will see...

dv: 7 stones on the right side, none at the other sides: overconcentrated for sure]
;W[cj]C[Milouz : maybe D10 could have been better ?

dv: Since this is likely to become a moyo game, E10 will indeed flatten out the white moyo too easily. Still, C10 takes the biggest area, so no big issue.]
;B[jp];W[mg]C[dv: You play on the edge of two moyos: this looks very good]
;B[mk]LB[cd:F][jj:E][gp:C][hp:D][fq:A][gq:B]C[Milouz : know, I would have to replay, I would hesitate between several points ('a' to 'f').

dv: I like all the ideas, B, E and F being good implementations of them]
;W[ni]LB[qb:a][qq:b][qi:c][km:d]C[Milouz : ...but I was afraid by the strong black moyo and white on O11 is an unconvinced invasion with an only result : black reinforcement :-(
Anyway, I think it's a bit late to invade black now.

dv: this move and your explanation show (in my opinion) a wrong way of thinking about the game

A moyo should be thought of as a sphere of influence (yes I know you know that already) in which White will not make life unless at the expense of some big black profit. This profit can be secure territory, or a strong group on the outside, influencing a large part of the board.

At A, White can take territory and reduce black's
At B, White can invade.Black 3 and 5 will be overconcentrated
At C, there is room for invasion, this being the most difficult move
At D, White can reduce the moyo

With all these options open, White should perhaps better continue his own moyo, which will be larger than black's, while black cannot  capitalize on his in one move.]
;B[pi];W[cd];B[fq];W[dn];B[fo];W[fm]C[Milouz : I have a big influence, but I'm more open to invasion.

dv: Yes I agree. The 18-19 exchange was a big loss. 24 is a good move though, keeping the pressure up.]
;B[fc]LB[ec:B][hc:A]C[Milouz : black invasion. How to respond ?]
;W[ec]LB[fe:a][hc:b]C[dv: definitely a possible play; one could think of A, B as well]
;B[hc];W[ef]LB[id:A][fd:a][fe:b][ge:c][he:d][ie:e]C[Milouz : maybe J16 was better

dv: Instinctively you want to play B, making a nice tiger mouth, getting a grip on the original invading stone. However, that will overconcentrate the corner. Hence you may play C-F to attack the two stones from a distance. F is a good attacking move (keima) but it takes the group into the moyo, so you'll have to kill it otherwise it will destroy all the potential there.

28 is a case of single mindedly making territory. It doesn't put enough pressure on Black's group.]
;B[ic];W[jd]C[dv: good move];B[he];W[hg]C[dv: yes, the pat on the head is a very good attacking move]
;B[if];W[kf];B[ig];W[hh];B[ih];W[hi];B[ii];W[hk];B[fe];W[ff]
LB[hj:a]C[Milouz : black invasion succeded.

dv: Quite the contrary. White's splendid chase from 32 to 38 made a territory of 55+ points on the left, while securing the upper group with another 15 points. Black has been walking on neutral points instead and his group is not 100% secure either. The result is the best what White can expect from a moyo. Maybe 40 should have simply extended at A.]
;B[gf];W[gd];B[fd];W[gg];B[hf];W[mq]C[Milouz : my turn to invade.
I aim to develop on the side, or in the corner, or to rush true the center.
I will depend on black answer.

dv: it looks like a good invasion point];B[oq];W[dr];B[eq];W[dq]
;B[kq];W[hn];B[hp];W[id];B[hd]
(;W[ij]LB[qb:a][gs:b][km:c]C[Milouz : But now, I abandonned my stone to try some silly things :-(

dv: oh, but abandoning 48 is very good: it is a lost stone. and 58 is a technically strong move. Now you just have to make sure you reduce the potential territory. A, B are big endgame, C has even still impact on the black dragon]
;B[ki];W[oh]C[dv: but from here on, you lose focus. it  seems you think you are behind and bump against his moyo in frustration. some counting would ave shown you are not behind]
;B[og];W[ph];B[qh];W[ng];B[nf];W[mf];B[ne];W[me];B[oi];W[lj]
;B[li];W[mj];B[nh];W[mh];B[nj];W[mi];B[ok]C[Milouz : black group is living and reenforced !

dv: you cut off his group in exchange for some more secure territory

I give an idea in the var, how to wrap up the game]
(;W[kg]C[dv: This kills an eye, but doesn't take any points. See var how to handle the upper side]
;B[jb]C[very big];W[kb];B[ja];W[ka];B[hb];W[ha]LB[ga:a]C[dv: doesn't work]
;B[ib];W[ga];B[fb];W[eb];B[fa];W[km]C[good!];B[mn];W[lo];B[ln]
LB[lp:A]C[Milouz : black mistake. He should have tried to cut with M4 instead.]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[jo];B[jn];W[io];B[lp];W[mo];B[nn];W[mp]C[dv: This is a tremendous success for White. The black group is suddenly in dire straits.]
;B[eo];W[ip];B[iq]
(;W[lq]C[dv: here you try to capture a worthless stone, while you can attack the complete group; in the variation I show what's the weak spot (acc to me) but have a try at it yourself first]
;B[lr];W[jr];B[jq];W[kr];B[nr];W[mr];B[ir]LB[gr:A]C[Milouz : I think the vital point is on G2, but I missed it

dv: absolutely];W[gs];B[fs];W[fr];B[gr];W[er]C[Milouz : white mistake...]
;B[hs];W[gp];B[go];W[ep];B[fp];W[em]LB[dm:A][do:a]C[Milouz : white big mistake
I realised that black is living and reinforced. So, I have to reinforce white also. But I think the right play was 'A'.

dv: even B];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[bo];B[dm];W[en];B[cm];W[dk]
;B[dj];W[ck];B[ej];W[ch]LB[ek:a]C[dv: tactical mistake; A is simple & clean. There isn't really any room  for life here for Black.]
;B[gl]C[Milouz : nice plays from black. I feel very unconfortable now !]
;W[hl];B[gm];W[hm];B[el]C[dv: The confusion about the fight in the moyo costed the game. Other wise, your building a large moyo then how you dealt with his smaller but perhaps stable one, has been quite all right.

End of comments];W[am];B[ek];W[bl];B[eh];W[eg];B[fh];W[fg];B[dh]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[df];B[lk]C[Milouz : I totaly collapsed in the center. Really big failure !]
;W[qq]C[Milouz : maybe this is was a bit desesperate. It succeed, but I think it's because of black mistakes.]
;B[qp];W[rq];B[sp];W[pr];B[or];W[rs];B[sr];W[sq];B[rp]LB[rr:A]
C[Milouz : black mistake. 'A' instead would have killed white.

dv: correct!];W[ps];B[pq];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb];B[sb]C[Milouz : The game is over and black win easily !
