C[Hello, Jonathan.



I made a review for white, please, look through the game and then come back to the first move and read general summary.

In my review I mention joseki and doesn't make variations - this task I left to you for few reasons:

 it will be more profit if you look through yourself and study some combinations and positions;

 I can't show you every possibility, because of lots of good possible combinations.

I hope you'll understand and accept my decision.







Summary:

You have intuitive feeling of situation, but seems don't look carefully for opponents possibilities. Try to predict your contribution - it can be not dead group, but influence or reduction.

Try to look carefully on possible variations and keep calm if something go wrong, don't hurry up. And the must - train solving "life and death problems", it should help you improve yourself in go (next step - studying joseki and shapes).

Use scoring technik after each local fight - it helps you to make right decisions.

Eliminate own weaknesses first. Attack from the distance. 





Hope my review and advices give to you some profit and ways to improve yourself.

Best wishes, shade.];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[cd];B[jc];W[oq];B[qj]
;W[po]C[this move was a bit aggressive.  would playing at K4 or D10 be bigger? It seemed that black needed to be attacked because of his strong right side.



No, this is standard corner approach. I like this move and I think I'll do the same.

K4 and D10 also good options and it depends on your style which move best for you. As for me - K4 and D10 isn't ambitious and too passive for white.]
;B[qo]
(;W[jp];B[ec];W[ee]C[I am trying to press him down.  should I have played at D10. which was the biggest point on the board I assume.





Black already has an supporting stone at K17, hence your E15 isn't so urgent to reply.

Also - you invite Black to play inside your potential moyo..



If you'd had one more stone on the side, E15 will be great. In this situation hard to say which move is better - agressive E15 or more strong: C13, maybe D14. Again - it depends on your style of playing.

Playing D10 also looks good - this can be tenuki and coming to another corner approach. Also it cardinally change game - big moves became bE15 and bK10, you can try play this variations and see where you'll play next..]
;B[cj];W[ch];B[ej];W[cm]C[Good move - Black without base and must run away...]
;B[eh]
(;W[gc]C[this was too aggressive that didn't work out.  should I have played G16?





Yes, you're right - this is overplay.Seems better to play G15 or corner defence D17 and tenuki (look through variations). One more option to attack - H17 (attack from distance again).]
;B[fd];W[ge];B[gd]
(;W[hd]C[trying to isolate the top left stones...my position to too weak to to anything.



You're right - it is impossible to isolate Black.. hence you must see the result, you'll get before starting a fight..

I give you some possible variations, hope they could help you to see if your H16 was that you want.]

(;B[hc];W[ic];B[hb]
(;W[gb]C[should have played J16? G15?



Yes, outer side much better. 

I like J16 - it gives you good shape. It is hard to show you real advantage, I add few possible variations.]

Again - shape (J14) fits best. And Q14 too far away.];B[if]
;W[le];B[ie];W[oc]C[too aggressive. maybe O16 or even P15?



Yes, it is agressive, but playable. You can find joseki with this corner approach..

O16 and P15 gives you better connection, but makes easier for Black to defend.



At this point you're behind (good practice to estimate score after each 10-15 moves or after every local fight), hence P17 is good.]
;B[od];W[nd];B[pc]
(;W[nb]C[This seems a bit low and not proteckted from left side..Look through variations]

(;B[of]C[trouble!!



It will be hard to fight, but possible. Q14 doesn't dead, you have some possibilities (look through variations to next move).]

(;W[qh];B[oi];W[og];B[pe]

Good, also playable P12 - you separate Black stones.];B[pg]

(;W[qf];B[oe]
(;W[rc]C[change of plan..trying to make life...potential of Q18 to steal the corner



It looks tempting, but you left much weaknesses behind, it will get you troubles in future..

Eliminate own weaknesses first, don't create weak groups, especially if they are close to each other..]

(;W[sg]C[Also you can play variation to get tenuki and ko-fight]
;B[se]
(;W[qd]C[This is forcing move that left you without initiative and ko-threat.

;W[oo];B[on]
(;W[nn]C[too soon to hane. i saw a big moyo forming for black so I because desperate.



Playing close to your opponent stones you make them stronger.. It is good style of play while defending, but it doesn't feet if you want to attack.

Also (it is the main reason) you create weakness at O5. I give some variations..]
;B[no];W[mo];B[np];W[mp]C[Now you also have weakness at P4 - if Black play there, you'll lose your Q5 group and Black will get big strong corner (another argument for wN5 rather then wO6)]

yes, it is Black's mistake. Also I think Black should play nearby J8-K10 before D18 or Q3 - they are much bigger.]

Your upper group has live in corner. The only wekness is O15. And you definitely right - Black's moyo too large.

I like your move, also I point one more option, look through variation..]
;B[lj];W[ki];B[ih]
(;W[kg];B[mc];W[lc]C[too aggressive.



Yes, your weakness at O15 doesn't allow you to play this way, see variation.

Luck was on your side - Black makes few mistakes, that allows you to alive both groups and reduse some Black's territory.]
;B[nc];W[ob]
(;B[md];W[ne]C[i thought I could capture these stones.



Anycase - O15 is right move (look variations for bO15 instead of bN16).]

N13 isn't so nesessary just now - you can tenuki or play L12. N13 better to play only after bP12.

The reason of such order - you save bigger group first (M12 group) and then O14 group (12 points only).]
