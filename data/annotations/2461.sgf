C[I played white and I resigned.
I think most of my moves are quite good moves until my opponent has responded. Except for comments on my play I would like to know if there is anything special I should think of or work with.
There were several moves that I could not find any good responce to. Especially when I had played a kakari.

[DP\] Your opening comment gives one clue before I look at the game.  Whenever you think of a move, think of at least what your opponent's likely response will be, and what you plan to do after it.   Also, ensure you have a strategy, so that when you have sente, it will guide you as to where the best candidate moves live.]
;B[cd];W[pd];B[qp];W[dp]C[[DP\] So far you have chosen an influence based game, going for two star points.  Black wants a fight since he's played diagonally.  These things should be in your mind as the opening progresses]
;B[qf]C[[DP\] Black's choice of course, but in his shoes I'd have made a shimari since with your star-point stones an approach move is not urgent]
;W[nd];B[pi];W[ec]C[[DP\] I'd have a strong preference for the other corner.  If black plays P4 he gets a shimari and a powerful extension from it with the Q11 and R14 stones.  So better if you get there first and play P4 yourself]
;B[df]LB[gd:B][fe:A]C[I really did know know how to answer this move. I was thinking about A or B.

[DP\] The standard move for Black would be D15 to which a response at A would be good]
;W[hc]C[This felt very passive.

[DP\] It is.  Your earlier feelings were correct - F15 would serve nicely here and work well with your O16 and Q16 stones, and make it much more fun attacking if Black does something rash like invade at L17]
;B[kc]C[[DP\] I love it when my opponent does something like this :-)  A target to chase - not to kill (unless he screws up) but to torment whilst I take profit.  I've tried to give you some ideas in the variations from this node]

(;W[qd]C[[DP\] Ah - fear! See variations from previous move for ideas.]
;B[ke]C[[DP\] Guess where white should have been playing!  This is an excellent move for Black, getting his group into the centre and splitting white into two.  The H17 group is beginning to be in danger and N18 will substantially reduce top right territory]
;W[cc]LB[cc:B][qd:A]C[I was not happy with either A or B, but I wanted to secure both my groups.

[DP\] Well, I think you know what I think about A from previous comments!  Let's look at B.  It's a contact move, so usually a defensive played when you need to make shape or are under severe attack.  However you're not under severe attack, and your two point extension is ideal so I cannot say you have bad shape - consequently I cannot recommend the move.  If L15 stones were strong, then diving in to C18 would be a standard way of making space for eyes.  L15 is weak, so you should be attacking.  Not trying to kill, but tormenting.  H15 would keep the pressure on. Note also your own comment about responses - how will you respond to B17 now, which would be a normal response?]
;B[bc];W[cb]C[[DP\] If you had played C18 first and Black responded with B17, would you have played C17 next?]
;B[dd];W[op]C[[DP\] Good (but that centre top black group is key to this game....)]

(;B[po];W[oo];B[pm];W[kp]LB[qq:A]C[I was not very happy with this exchange. I was thinking about playing at A instead, but it looked like it should be very complicated.

[DP\] This exchange has served you well - you have secured some territory whilst Black has gained very little.  Have a look at the more traditional stuff from the move 18 variation]
;B[fq];W[eq]C[[DP\] A good response because you have the L4 stone in place.  You did think about that didn't you?? :-)]
;B[ip];W[fp]TR[eq]C[Is there a better way to punish black for not answering the previous move?

[DP\] Great move - there's no better way to hurt Black, who is now under very severe attack]
;B[gq];W[gp];B[hp];W[dj]C[[DP\] Good - you have attacked Black for his audacity, and now take some profit with your extension whilst Black must still worry about his weak H4 stones]
;B[eo]
(;W[fo]LB[ep:A]C[I was thinking about connection at A, but it also seemed very passive, but I don't think I gained very much with this move.

[DP\]  Ah - the empty triangle.  It's almost always wrong, as your comment above indicates :-)  Just connect at A, and E5 becomes very weak]
;B[cm]
(;W[dn]C[[DP\] An overplay which Black exploits with some panache.]
;B[cq]C[[DP\] Very nice - the double threat since White has not closed the corner on either side.  Game over now if Black can get properly into the centre]
;W[cp];B[er]C[[DP\] I'll go this way then...];W[dq];B[dr];W[en]
;B[dk]
(;W[ek]LB[ej:A]C[At A instead? Or somewhere else?

[DP\] These are all contact moves again.  Use them only in defence, unless very special circumstances arise.  F10 would be better, as in variation from previous move]

;B[ch];W[fj];B[md];W[nc];B[mc];W[og]C[Now I want to attack the black group on the top. The intention with this move was to separate the group from the stones on the right.

[DP\] This is a lovely move, and played with exactly the right spirit, but why did you leave it until after Black had strengthened his top centre stones??  See move 18...]
;B[pg]
(;W[bq]C[[DP\] I thought you were after the top centre?? But why not capture this with C2 instead?]
;B[mp];W[kn]C[This did not end well. What should I have done?

[DP\] This looks like a reasonable start];B[mn]C[[DP\] Here you are under attack.  Severe attack (those poor P4 stones).  And you are short of eye space / shape.  These are the conditions for contact moves - see variations]

(;W[mo]C[[DP\] This wedge will work under normal circumstances because of the two-stone wall at P4 - however, those stones are short of liberties...]
;B[no];W[lo];B[np];W[nn];B[on];W[nm];B[oq]C[[DP\] It will be very hard for white to win from here]
;W[om];B[pn]
(;W[ie]C[Attacking, but don't know how to get any force in the attack.

[DP\] Attack something else first whilst you build up strength.  That is what was so good about your P13 move earlier.  This time it is harder to find targets.  However, you have strength in the centre, so ensure he can't get eye-space on the side. O18 and K18 are the starting points.  But remember you're not trying to kill, just to torment!]

;B[ql];W[pj];B[qj];W[cr];B[jq];W[kq];B[kr];W[lr];B[ir]C[Here I feel that the game is already lost.

[DP\] OK - have you counted yet?  Approximately, Black has 20 on the left, 5 up top, 40 on the left and 10 at the bottom = 75.  White has 10 top left, 15 top right, 15 bottom left, 10 in the centre + 5 komi = 55.  So yes, it's difficult - time to play those double sente endgame moves.  B18, S15, O2 etc.  See variation.]
