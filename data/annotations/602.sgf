C[I play go a lot, but have been unable to greatly improve my playing ability, and I was hoping that you could review a game for me. Thanks for any help that you can give.

aga: Your main problem is playing small moves often, when many bigger ones available. It's the usual problem of low kyu players. Try to observe the whole board each third move looking for big moves before answering locally. I'm sure, you'll have to search other, much stronger opponent soon, to have a chance to be lost sometimes :-)]
;B[cp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[pj]C[aga: This move maybe slightly slow. Don't forget w has 5.5 komi, so b should play somewhat more aggressively to catch up. Of course, it's ok if you are know well how to use this stone fighting w corners.]
;W[jd]C[aga: But this looks ok: it's not only a good extension from wQ16. Additionally, it weakens bQ10 a bit, and prevents you from building shimari in bUL corner.]
;B[nq]LB[np:a]C[aga: Having in mind bQ11 I'd play here one line higher, at "a". It works better with Q10 restricting white in LR corner.]
;W[oq]C[aga: I don't like this move by wthite. Attaching during fuseki (game openings) is usually makes opponent stronger, but gives litle advantage to himself.]
;B[nr]LB[np:a]C[aga: I would recommend play here bO4 instead. It still gives you good opportunities to build base on the side, but have much more influence on center, decreasing white's influence. Accompanying with prevoiusly played bQ10, which limits wLR corner extension upon right side, bO4 looks woderful for me.]
;W[or];B[qf]LB[kq:a][jp:b][jq:c][ph:d][qh:e][iq:f]C[aga: Dangerous. Your lower two stones are not settled yet, so if white will play around "a" (maybe "f" there for white since then it will attack one of black position settling the same time) before you, bO2 and bO3 would look very weak. Other good move for white is O4. It cuts off your lower and right side, and penetrates to center in sente, because wO4 forces you to build a base.

Other disadventage of this move is that it is slightly far from bQ10: there are two weak points, "d" and "e", and shape is still open from lower. You don't need to worry about them right now, but in middle game you'll be concerned of enforcement this connection.

I'd recommend you to play "a" or maybe "c" here. If bO2 was at bO4 then you could play "b" or "c".]
;W[nd]C[aga: Right answer for white, building territory and not provoking extra fight.]
;B[qc]C[aga: Right.];W[qd]LB[pc:a]C[aga: It'll be simpler fo white to block here in other direction, at P17. wQ16 does not decreases b territory alot, and wP14 protects upper white territory, allows get sente and tenuki immediately.]
;B[rd];W[rc]C[aga: I have never seen this move; it does not really helps blocking at Q line, does not separates b stones, and forces b to build eyeness shape.]
;B[rb];W[pc];B[sc];W[pb]C[aga: Small. Bad.];B[qb]C[aga: Small. Bad.]
;W[qa]C[aga: Very small. Very bad.]
(;B[ra]C[aga: Very small. Very bad.

Small moves is a usual problem of low kyu players. Fuseki (game openings), and middle game requires much faster area development. The main amount of points is always gained from territory, not prisoners, so you need to claim as much your territory as you can in fuseki (and be able to implement your influence to build territory in middle game. In order to claim more territory you need to keep sente, and if you lost it - to gain it as soon as possible.

Let me explain it on example.

Let's count a bit. Look at Q15:T19 area. In game w managed to have 0 points here, and you have 6: 5 territory + 1 prisoner. So, result is +6 for black.

White's 22 move was sente, but small sente. So, you can ignore it and tenuki (play elsewhere), i.e. gain sente. Look at variation here.]

(;W[pa]C[aga: Even this move is small. Noone should afraid of giving one stone to opponent at this early stage of a game. Look at variation here. If white would tenuki (see variation here), local difference would be -3 (2 points of territory, and 1 prisoner), but other w big move would give him about 10 points too.]
;B[re];W[ce];B[cd]C[aga: Attaching strengthens opponent! You don't familiar with this joseki (BTW, learning josekis is definitely required to be a good player), so I don't believe you can get any huge gain having w strengthened (and you haven't in actual game).]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[ad]LB[de:a][gc:b]C[aga: Small. You should not answer this, but should have played "a" (preferable) or "b", for example.

Moves on 1st line are usually yose (endgame moves); they are extremely rare worth to be played in middle game. Whenever you are going to play it, there should be alarm inside you: "THAT MOVE HAVE 99.9% CHANCE TO BE SMALL!" Your opponent just played there? Wonderful, left him there picking 1-2-3 points of each his move, and take ~10 points moves somewhere else, and win.]
;B[ac];W[be];B[de];W[cg]LB[ch:a][ci:b]C[aga: Making eyespace (BTW, 2-space extension to "a" is better). If you'd not _force_ w to play B15 with your A17 move, you'd have now possibility to pincer w group with move around "b". That move would force w to make small eyes allowing you to surround him gaining influence, or, better for him, run in the middle - and you could make many threatening moves building your own territory along upper side and having influence or even wall faced down, giving for black _nothing_ at all except hope to connect to other live group.

(You should not try to kill his group, you should only _threat_ to kill)]
;B[hc]C[aga: Again 3-space extension, along third line. Of course it allows you to develop territory faster, but it leaves more aji (threats) and often costs you sente.]
;W[ic];B[ib]LB[hb:a]C[aga: Greedy, not good. You are gaining 2-4 points, but loosing sente, i.e. your move which costs +10 now for you. Just play "a", and after wJ18 play tenuki.]
;W[jb];B[ia]LB[fc:a]C[aga: You already understood it's small. Just play H18 if you are extremely wants to play here, or H16 instead - wH18 is not as big as it looks, and H16 protects your gap around "a" and makes some influence on center. If your opponent will decide to take bJ18 right now he'd lost sente; so he would play 2-point move allowing you to play 10-point one.]
;W[ja];B[hb];W[he]LB[hd:a]C[aga: White hane at "a" would place stronger pressure on your group.]
;B[gd]TR[hc]C[aga: If you'd placed your marked stone one line closer, to G17, you would not have to play here, and could use sente somewhere else.]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[dr];B[cr];W[bq]C[aga: ??? White has to have thickness around C6 to have this move meaningful. This case b can easily get second eye on the left side or capturing D2.]
;B[cq];W[cs]C[aga: Small, and very weak.];B[bs]C[aga: Maybe 1-2 points are the only points worth to be played sometimes early since they are convinient to build eyes quickly.

But anyway, here just play E2. Long diagonal chain is asking to be cutted.]
;W[ds];B[br]C[aga: Just E2 to capture white stones. Corner is small to live there for w, and w can't escape along left side.]
;W[bo];B[bp];W[ap];B[aq];W[ao];B[co];W[bm];B[qn]LB[bn:a][er:b]
C[aga: Very good! You can play "a" or "b" each costs 6-8 points. It is not too small, but your move is bigger, and you anyway can play either "a" or "b", or both later.]
;W[qo];B[ro]C[aga: Greedness will not give you a profit. Just S6, and after wS5 add a stone at Q9 reliable securing your 20 point of territory. Much better then to have 2 points but to lost 15 after invasion, heh?]
;W[rp];B[so];W[sp];B[rn];W[np]TR[nq][nr]C[aga: Good move. It separates your groups, add influence in center, and now your marked stones are look very weak.]
;B[lq]LB[kq:a]C[aga: Meaningless. You are asking to be pincered since 1-step extension on third does not give you enough eyespace. Play "a" here.]
;W[ol]C[aga: This move is premature. W would better continue pressure lower b group building wall faced center. Having this wall w could penetrate deeper.]
;B[pl];W[nm];B[pm]C[aga: Small. The difference between bQ7 and bR7 (or even bR8 with bS7) is only one point. You'd better protect around Q12, increasing your influence to upper right center area.]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[qg];W[pf];B[gq]C[aga: Because of your 3-space connections, you had to spend many stones on right, and you have to spend one more. Instead, see variation of next white move what can happens.]

(;W[fp];B[fq];W[ep];B[er];W[fn];B[es]C[aga: you don't need to capture w stones right now: w group at D1 had only liberty, so you could capture it when required.]
;W[dj];B[hp];W[fe];B[fd];W[ee];B[ed];W[df]
(;B[dd]LB[ge:a][oj:b][hn:c]C[aga: Again very small, skip it. Breaking through "a" (or "b", or "c") is more urgent.]
;W[kg]C[aga: Really big move.];B[im];W[hn]TR[hn][fn][fp][hp]
LB[go:a]C[aga: Marked w stones makes bad shape: using marked b stone w can be cutted easily at "a".]
;B[in];W[io];B[ho];W[jo];B[jp];W[ko];B[gn];W[hm];B[gm];W[hl]
;B[fo];W[gp];B[go]TR[gp][fp][eq][ep]C[aga: Just play E5 here, and after wG5 - bJ4. Use the fact marked w group havn't enough liberties.]
;W[il];B[jm]TR[in][im]C[aga: Sacrifice marked stones. You have no direction to run away. They will probably help you invading from right deeper, but they are not alive.]
;W[jl];B[km];W[kl];B[eo];W[lm];B[dp]C[aga: You'll have time to capture those stones later; locally, play E7 instead to increase your territory and decrease white's. Globaly, you urgently need to penetrate in white's moyo before it'll be completely closed.]
;W[kn]TR[km][jm][im][in]C[aga: The same is applied for white: he should left marked stone for a while, they can't escape.]
;B[fm];W[en];B[dn]C[aga: The ladder does not work for you, so you should not play it. bD7 here works.]
;W[em];B[el];W[ck];B[dm];W[jn];B[bn]C[aga: Still small.];W[mo]
;B[an]C[aga: Less than small. W group had only one liberty, so you could capture it anytime, with bA6 or bA7.]
;W[am];B[fj]C[aga: Absolutely right.];W[fi];B[hj];W[ii];B[hh]
TR[hh][hj][fj]C[aga: Don't repeat your opponent's mistake: shape of marked stones is bad.]
;W[hi];B[gi];W[gh];B[gj];W[ih];B[hg]LB[fh:a][ge:b][oj:c]C[aga:
- "Doctor, will I be alive?" ;-|
- "Any meaning?" :-)

Forget about bH12; play "a" locally (it's double atari); globally "b" or even "c" are better.]
;W[ig];B[gg];W[fh];B[gf]C[aga: No-no-no, you shouldn't peep, you should cut! Peep is useful for destroying opponent's eyeshape, or placing your own stones to create eyeshape for your group, or to create thickness. W is alive all around, you have no eyespace here (and which thickness can exist here, with w stones all around :) ), so you have to cut, and then try to connect.]
;W[ge];B[fg];W[eh];B[pe]C[aga: Hopeless. First of all, you'll be cutted yourself immediately, second - you have no direction to run to, third - wO16 stone will even not let you to run anywhere.]
;W[qe];B[oe];W[pi];B[qi];W[ij]LB[nf:a][oj:b]TR[oe][pe]C[aga: Greedy! What W is protecting here - 2 points?!? Just "a" to localize a cutting stones, or even "b" to prevent larger cut - marked stones will be caught anyway.]
;B[ng];W[of];B[nf];W[ne];B[ni];W[nh]TR[of][pf][pg][ph][pi][oe]
[pe]LB[oj:a]C[aga: Another mistake of W. W should protect cut at "a". Marked w stones are alive because marked b stones have only one dame (liberty).]
;B[mh];W[mg]LB[oj:a]C[aga: Very bad. After this move cut at "a" is unprotectable. A gold rule: first surround, then capture. Otherwise it looks funny.]
;B[oh];W[oi];B[nj];W[oj];B[ok];W[nk]LB[og:a]C[aga: l;-))))) Capture, capture 'em at "a"!]
;B[pk];W[mi]TR[of][pf][pg][ph][pi][oi][oj]C[aga: W is definitelly don't need marked stones. What are you waiting for?]
;B[lh];W[mj];B[nh];W[od]C[aga: I think there was a shout "AAAAAAAA!" and quickly played stone then ;-))]
;B[ml]C[aga: Now w is very thick here. Play P7 to reduce W territory a bit, or better resign.]
;W[nl]C[aga: Current count:   B: 19(UL) + 26 (UR) + 37 (L) + 16 (captured prisoners) = 98pts

W: 13 (LR) + 98 (C) + 6 (captured prisoners) + 14 (uncaptured yet dead stones) + 5.5 (komi) = 136.5pts

Yes, it's right time to resign.])
(;B[ge];W[gf];B[ff];W[ef];B[hf];W[gg];B[ie]))
(;W[oj];B[pi];W[oi];B[ok];W[nk];B[pk];W[hd]C[aga: You have not gained points in this sequence, and white have built strong center moyo, almost territory (~25 points now)]
))
(;W[np];B[pa];W[oa];B[qa];W[ob]))
(;B[re]C[aga: Let's assume you've played here.];W[ra]C[aga: If white will use absence of your stone at S19...

(If his not, then why you have played S19?)];B[eq]C[aga: ...you can just tenuki.]
;W[sa]C[aga: Maybe right now, but I think much later, in endgame, w could play here.]
;B[sb];W[pa]C[aga: Let's count again in Q15:T19 area. W again has 0 points, and you have 4: 3 territory, and 1 prisoner. So, local result is +4 for black.

You say that it is worse that the game (where were +6)? Not at all! Following this variation you've played E3 which is not just big, it's HUGE. And it threats to make other huge move around D10.

It is not posibble to count bLL corner exactly, but rough counting will be enough for us. First of all, corner is usually 8-10 points, and you obviously can extend from this shimari on lower or left side, so additional 6 points are guaranted for you outside shimari. Moreover, it's likely you'll have some territory around E5, but it becames very hard to count, and result will be extremely irreliable. After all, C4 stone had guaranteed you about 4 points already.

So, we surely can expect E3 costs AT LEAST 8+6-4=10 points.

Summary, global result is +14 for black. Compare it with actual game result +6 (about 40% of 14 - less than half!): you'd gain at least 8 points playing big move instead of small.

You've played alot of small moves this game (I'll show some of  them later), at least 5 of them had relative cost about -8, and much more had cost about -3. So, only making small moves you've lost about 70 (!) additional points. You have to agree with me, not loosing it is MUCH more than enough to win :-)

In the game this difference was compensated alot by small moves of your opponent; but he made less of them, and he won.]
