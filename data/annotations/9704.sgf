C[Hello, reviewer! I'm going to try to be sparse with my comments in here, but there are a few moves I'm particularly curious about. I'll also point out mistakes I know I made, to save you the trouble. Thank you for your time!]

;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]LB[kc:D][nc:B][qf:A][nq:C]C[DC: Hi! Dylan Carter 1d. Common continuations A-D in order of frequency.

A - Postion on the right. B has to approach Thickness to extend.
B - Moyo, continuation O15. (W Q18, R17, M16 is a mistake as B can live using the F17 stone.)
C - Tennuki
D - The proper extension.]
(;W[fd]C[DC: This move is too tight with the one space low pincer. It is playable when the W stone is @K16.]
;B[mc];W[qn]C[What should motivate which side to approach from? I thought a lot about this one, and decided this side was better because he played N17, so approachng top right might be good. Early game in general is so vague.

DC: A simple principle guides us, we play in the most open area. This move is open enough to be correct, I preffer O3. Either approaching makes it of more value. I hope this reduces the ambiguity.]
;B[ql];W[on];B[np];W[pk];B[qk]C[My favorite joseki site says B is off the main line here, and it looks to me like I came out ahead. Would you agree?

DC: No, the pattern search I use has the common variations. Additionally it is good that B pushes from behind. Either way I would jump in to the corner as white instead of P6 because N17 denies the influence game somewhat.]

;B[rf]C[I already read and saw this didn't work unless he let me run out P14. Nice and calm survive. It's sad to lose sente over this, though. Should I have hardened the group up with one more stone?

DC: The position is difficult for W regardless, 3/3 invasion is gone and the groups are split and weak. At move 40 we should be doing grander thing than creating living groups.]

I also need to strengthen this group against P9, so this move seemed a good compromise. I'm not confident in it, though.]

DC: The weak group needs tending unless there is another 21 point gote move.]
;B[jc]
(;W[jg]C[Any tips on how to place these high-flying stones would be appreciated. It seems clear to me that something big and central needs to happen.

DC: The centre is rarely of any large value. Two principles work here; 1 The order or play generally is corner, sides centre. Of equal importance is SWOT. Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. W is strong everywhere except the weakness at K3 group, I see no imediate opportunity to attack thus I consider the threat against my weak K3 group. If you are of the mind to sacrifice then magari G5 achives more. If B takes it...]
