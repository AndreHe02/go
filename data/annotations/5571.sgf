C[For the most part I didn't know what was going on in this game.  I was playing White against a nominally equal player (11k BGA) and doing pretty much what I usually do.  The way the game was going I decided to emphasize influence early on, but somehow it never really got used (and got broken in the upper right I think), I never developed any frameworks, all my attacks failed and I ended up with very little territory anywhere.

Any pointers on where this game went wrong for me would be useful :)

s: Hello Karl. My name is Sam Tregar.  I play on KGS as a 4 kyu and in the AGA as a 6 kyu.  I'll do my best to review your game, but please be aware that I'm far from an expert!  If you have questions please feel free to contact me via email or find me on KGS (username is samtregar).]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[pc];W[dp];B[qf]LB[qe:A]C[s: This is a bit unusual.  The normal corner enclosure would be A.  This move leaves a weakness around A that you should aim to exploit later.]
;W[jd]LB[fc:C][ic:B][id:A]C[Thought that edge needed breaking up before Black made a huge framework, felt K17 was too low and would allow him to just come over the top of me.  But then he just came under me.

s: This move looks ok to me.  I might make it one point to the left at A or B, following the common advice to play away from strength.  C also feels plausible.]
;B[fc];W[md]LB[fc:A][cf:B][jp:C]TR[jd]C[maybe this should have been third-line?  Since I had two hoshi at the far end of the board I decided to go for influence on the top too.

s: This is a bad move, I think.  The marked stone is in no danger - A is too far away to threaten it.  This move doesn't put any preasure on black, and it doesn't really help you very much.  I would prefer a move around B, although a move around C is also probably ok.]
;B[ic];W[dg]LB[ce:B][cf:A]C[blocking the double-wing formation.  Didn't want to come too close though and encourage a tight pincer as I could easily be split from the k16 stone if I tried to run for that, then both groups would be under pressure.

s: You have the right idea, but this move is too slack.  It's just too far from black's corner.  Play it at A or B instead.]
;B[ck];W[jp]LB[dk:B][dl:A]C[s: Ok, but I think I would have prefered A or B.  When you're playing for influence you really need to keep the preasure on your opponent - force him to live low!]
;B[ch];W[dh];B[cg];W[dj]C[Influence is really becoming my focus by now, but I guess I didn't know how to use it (or my positions on the top and left edge were too weak).

s: This is a good influence building move, but beware - it gives points to black.  You need to be sure you're getting a good deal.]
;B[cj];W[pj]LB[di:A][dk:B]TR[dg][dh][dj]C[s: No!  You absolutely must continue to build your wall.  A play at A or B is essential.  As it stands your marked stones are much too weak to be helpful.  Once you've finished building a good wall you can use your influence to attack.]
;B[qn]C[s: Good invasion by black.  Notice how much more threatening this is than any of your moves around black's corners.]
;W[qo]LB[pn:A][np:B]C[Aha, a chance to make Black overconcentrated.

s: This doesn't seem like the right move for an influence strategy.  I think A or B would be better.  The last thing you want is black developing influence here...]
;B[on]LB[rn:A]C[s: I just learned from Cho Hun-Hyun's book of Go lectures that this move is bad because of the weakness at A.  See the variation (not that you should play this immediately, but it should be on your mind).]

(;W[np]C[If black was at q6, I'd normally play this on the third line but in this case wanted to keep the pressure on Black since he's making more of a break for the centre.]
;B[qk];W[qj];B[pk];W[nj]LB[oj:B][ok:A]C[s: The proverb says "han on the head of two stones"!  You could follow the proverb with A!  You're letting black get away too easily here.  Alternately, I think B might be the best move.  The move you played is both too loose to be threatening and too weak to build power for you.]
;B[nk];W[ok]C[Maybe this should have been around tengen?

s: This looks ok to me - it would appear to be sente.];B[ol]
;W[oj];B[mk]TR[qn]C[s: this results seems really bad from an influence perspective - black is running right into the center with plenty of strength.  I think you needed to find a way to attack the mark stone while maintaining your influence lead.]
;W[pe]TR[nj][oj][pj][qj][ok]C[I'm pretty sure this is a major mistake.  I was wanting to give the wall on the tenth line something to work with, and decided to harrass black's corner in the process, but it turned out badly for me.

s: The timing seems strange to me but I like this spot to start an invasion.  I wish your marked stones were a little stronger though...]
;B[qe];W[pd]LB[qd:A]C[maybe should have been q14?

s: yes, this is a bad move... You should almost never run two stones into a stone like this.  The proverb says "han on the head of two stones" and you just did it to yourself when black plays A!  This is also called a "thank you" move since black is happy to play the reply...]
;B[qd];W[oc]C[s: What's going on here?  If you want influence then you should be playing Q14.  This is a small territory move and it leaves you with a bad shape.]
;B[pb];W[nl]TR[dg][dh][dj]C[Trying to make life difficult for both black groups.

s: I like the idea, but it would work so much better if the marked group was in better shape...]
;B[om];W[mm];B[rj];W[ri];B[rk];W[mo]LB[qi:A]C[s: Yikes - bad aji at A.  I don't think you can afford to leave that for long.]
;B[qq];W[ro]C[Determined not to let his side group off too easily.]
;B[oo];W[pq]LB[qi:A]TR[ri][nj][oj][pj][qj][ok]C[Or his corner.  Am I spreading myself too thin here?  Black has a series of moves coming up where he pushes me around and makes space for his side group, which I hadn't anticipated -- I think I was focussing too much on attacking him.  I think I find weak-looking groups too tempting not to attack them.

s: I'm no master of life and death, but black doesn't look weak here to me.  He's got lots of ways to make eyes and your marked group is weak now with the defect at a A...]
;B[rn];W[mj];B[lk];W[sj]C[Still trying to attack the side group.  It looked attackable and I'd somehow failed to notice all the forcing moves black is about to play.

s: This looks like small endgame at best, completely useless at worst...]
;B[mn]C[Here we go.];W[ln];B[no]
(;W[nn]LB[lp:A];B[op];W[nq];B[po];W[qp];B[lm];W[mn];B[ml];W[nm]
C[Ouch.];B[km];W[kn];B[lj];W[li]LB[ng:B][mh:A]C[Thought for a long time here trying to work out if there was any way left to kill the edge group, but decided there was nothing.

s: I think this has to be at A or B.  You need to connect these stones to the upper side group before you can attack...]
;B[ki];W[kh]C[Hane or stretch?  I saw that black would have to stop and protect his cutting point at move 75 (which he did) but his cutting stone gave me more trouble than I expected even so.

s: stretch - your stones are slowly being surrounded...  even if they don't die their weekness is your opponents friend.]
;B[lh];W[mi];B[jh];W[kg];B[jj];W[qh]C[And now I'm worried about black playing a ladder breaker, so protect the cut and give black time to attack me more.

s: black let you off easy here, I think.  He must have been scared to lose his center group...]
;B[pg];W[lg];B[ng];W[mg];B[cn];W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[eq]C[My side is very loose and easy to invade at this point, but I didn't think I ever had time to deal with it, too much else going on.  Was there a point earlier when I should have played around this edge?

s: Of course your territory is loose - you were playing for influence!  If you wanted to make firm territory here then you had to play lower...]
;W[dq];B[hq];W[co]LB[er:B][ir:A]C[s: feels like bad timing to me - you need to kill black's invasion, and I think you can.  He doesn't have a safe shape yet.  A play around A or B will put preasure on black.]
;B[bn];W[bo]C[s: awful move - this sequence ends in gote giving black a chance to rescue his weak group!]
;B[ao];W[ap];B[an];W[bq];B[ho];W[jm];B[jl];W[im];B[gm];W[hn]
LB[gn:A]C[s: my fighting instincts are telling me A is the spot...]
;B[gn];W[go];B[gp];W[fo];B[eo]
(;W[fp]LB[ep:A];B[fq];W[ep];B[hm];W[in];B[il]
(;W[io]LB[iq:A][ir:B]C[s: I don' t like this move, it feels slack.  Better to play A or B now.  Sure, black can atari at J5, but that's not too dangerous...  I may be missing a good move but I can't see how black lives after A.  I left the variations I played through for you to look at...]
;B[jr];W[iq];B[ir];W[hp];B[gq];W[em];B[dl];W[hl]C[Last-ditch attempt to save the game by trying to attack the centre group.

s: seems unlikely to me...  so many ways to make eyes...];B[gl]
;W[hk];B[ik];W[hj];B[el];W[ii];B[ji];W[kl];B[kk];W[ll];B[ij]
C[And that's it.  I resigned here.

s: Ultimately, I think you lost because you didn't put enough preasure on your opponent, and you left weak groups around for him to attack.  He played a good, aggressive game and was able to dictate the flow the of the game. You also didn't follow your chosen strategy carefully enough - if you want influence you have to be willing to play to sacrifice to get it.

s: If you like to read Go books I suggest you read Attack and Defence - it will help you spot opportunities to invade.  Also, Janice Kim's beginner books are always useful - they helped me go from 10k to 7k, so perhaps you would find them useful too!

s: Thank you for allowing me to review your game.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.]
