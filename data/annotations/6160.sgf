C[A: This was played on KGS. We both did our 8k best to lose and I eventually succeeded due to a life and death mistake. There are numerous other tactical errors played by both sides, but I'm more interested in overall strategy/direction of play advice. Thanks!]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[cd];B[pj];W[ec]C[Ben: Black's last move was slightly unusual.  This response also unusual although I can't say either moves are necessarily bad.  It just depends on what your plan is.]
;B[qg]C[Ben: Not severe at all.]
(;W[cj]C[Ben: Possibly a bit tame.  Why not approach?];B[kc]
;W[mc]MA[nc]C[Ben: I would play at X, it makes a more secure base and does essientially the same thing as your move.]
;B[hc];W[qd];B[re];W[rd];B[fd];W[fc];B[gd]C[A: I think this exchange helped b more than w.
Ben: Difficult to say, f-16 was an odd move imo.]
(;W[me]MA[og][mf][ke]C[Ben: Locally be more aggressive (I marked "x" for examples) But really a move is begging to be played on the lower side now.]
;B[ld];W[md];B[le]C[Ben: Tenuki here also would be good.  Black isnt threatening to do anything important.]
;W[mg];B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[cn]C[A: Was this tenuki bad? I didn't know where to go with n15 and thought it was stable enough to take a big point instead.

Ben: I probably would prefer to approach from the other side since you are strong already on this side.]
;B[fq];W[bp];B[cq];W[en]MA[dl]C[A: I liked this play at the time, but now it seems too short. Should I have jumped a bit further or played somewhere else?

Ben: This move is necessary.  Some play at X instead.];B[fo]
;W[fn]C[Ben: This play I would ignore if I were black.  It doesn't seem all that big.]
;B[jp]C[Ben: A good move.];W[np]C[A: I didn't want to get stuck in corner with 3-3 invasion, but wasn't sure how else to begin.

Ben: Here the damage has been done.  He's going to get a lot of points on one side or the other.  I agree 3-3 doesn't look that good.  Basically you should concentrate on make a flexible and live shape.  This approach is fine but your follow up makes things worse.]
;B[pm]MA[nq][pn]C[A: This surprised me. Black's mapping out a big area and I felt like it was too open to be secure, so I tried 3-3 after all.

Ben: Actually this looks weak to me.  He should have played at either x.]

(;W[qq]C[Ben: It is very bad to combine this with the high move on 0-4.  If you wanted to try this a low kakari on  0-3 was better.]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[oq]C[Ben: And now we see that your shape is going to be bad.]
;B[qr];W[nr];B[ps];W[kq]C[A: This was exactly what I'd planned, but I'm not sure if it was a good idea.

Ben: The weakness around n-3 leaves cause to be nervous.  I would try to think of a way to remove it.  I can't see one now.]

(;B[jn]C[nmxx [8k\]: i just try to get good reflex
appleseeds [8k\]: no problem];W[mm];B[ln];W[mn];B[kk]C[Ben: Unusual, is he attacking?]
;W[mk];B[oi]C[Ben: Again this is too slow for him.]
(;W[po]C[A: tried to use the white wall to invade. It failed.
Ben: This is probably early.  Im going to try to look at something, I don't know that it works.]

;W[ei]MA[ef]C[A: I had sente now and wanted to make a bit of territory on left to balance the game. However, this may have been too big.

Ben: I would try something like X.];B[dl];W[fl]MA[fk]C[Ben: I think at X and this stone is just dead.  It probably still is dead but there are complications as we see.]

Ben: See all the variations for a fairly complete survey.  He actually gave you several outs.  With black's best move your best outcome is to sacrifice the marked stones..probably.  The game was quite close and I think you were ahead.]
