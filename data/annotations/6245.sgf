C[buckyyowza:  Hello! Comments by Mark Fyffe, prefixed with "buckyyowza".  I comment mostly for black, but white makes some large mistakes that I point out as well.  You can find overall comments on the last move.  I hope you enjoy my review!

Any comment and advice is welcome ;)];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq]LB[fp:A]SQ[pd][pq]C[buckyyowza: black should not leave this joseki now, unless he has a very well thought out plan that retains sente... so he can come back to A.  This sequence builds a strong shape for black that plays well off the marked stones, but gives white a strong shape in the corner and sente.  If left alone now, black gets nothing - unless he is a pro ;-)

I thought I could leave the joseki as it is and play elsewhere (I saw this in some pro games...), but I don't know how to handle the cut at A, so I continued the joseki...
Do you yhink I could have play elsewhere ?];B[fp];W[do];B[jq]
LB[dm:B][cn:A][jp:C]C[buckyyowza: these stones seem abnormal... I would expect white to play C6 or D7, and for black to play higher, at K4.  In black's case, the resulting side moyo is difficult for white to play in due to the triangle shape around F4, so a 4th line play offers faster development.  White's shape after #10 is weak, leaving a double-attack aji at D4.]
;W[qo];B[oo];W[pk];B[qm]LB[jd:B][ce:C][pm:A]TR[qo]C[buckyyowza: no, I prefer R7 - A helps white build shape here where R7 attacks these two stones using black's strong group.  However, it is too early to threaten this group with an invasion or reduction since white has soo much wide open potential to escape into.  At best, this play will swallow the R5 stone, which is big. However there are much larger things on the board right now.  I would prefer a course of action that reduces white's overall thickness on the board or to start playing into his sphere - perhaps a play at K16 or C15

maybe A was better, what do you think ?];W[pn];B[pm];W[om]C[buckyyowza: white misreads ;-)  should be P6 - R3 is still open for at least 1 eye in the corner, but cut off from the center white dies.]
;B[on];W[ol];B[qn];W[po];B[ro];W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[pp]C[I think White made a mistake...

buckyowza: yes, black is quite lucky here :-)];W[qf]C[buckyyowza: however, this short-sighted move by white is even worse.  A high approach from the other side is a better way for white to work quickly to recover this game.]
;B[nc];W[rd]
(;B[qh]LB[qc:A][de:C][ph:B]SQ[pi]C[buckyyowza:  Good question.  A-B-C is certainly more peaceful, and also more normal if you do not consider the Q9 stones.  With those in mind, however, your alternate suggestion will help white considerably.  Therefore, I agree with black here and prefer a pincer.  As a matter of style, I would play Q11 to continue building on the large framework set up in the lower left - though R12 is certainly not a bad choice. See var for some ideas here.

Maybe Black A, White B, Black C would have been more peaceful (and the side white territory is still open), but since I'm string in the lower left...

What do you think ?];W[pg];B[ph];W[oh]C[buckyyowza: I know you played black ;), but please note that this hane is not a good idea (see move 18)!  Black's stones are actually stronger than white here, and in general this shape leaves all sorts of bad aji.  P13 is white's best choice in this position.]
;B[rk];W[nh];B[kc];W[cj];B[og]C[buckyyowza: a good point of attack, but since white can still easily settle in R17, this play is aji-keshi here.  cutting two strong groups rarely has much effect.]
;W[ld];B[of];W[qc];B[lc];W[md];B[nd];W[oe];B[ne];W[nf];B[ng]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[pe];B[lf]LB[dl:A]TR[nh][oh][pk][ol][om]C[buckyyowza: consider that N12 has greater effect.  If black can seal off the marked stones, then this will be an easy game.  Even something so far away as D8 will develop this position nicely.]
;W[ce];B[mh]C[buckyyowza: timing is everything.  This is too slow now, though it was perfect 2 moves ago!  Now black is becoming overconcentrated.  I would definitely play D8 now, before white takes over the entire left side without opposition.]
;W[jo];B[lp];W[hr];B[fr]LB[hp:A]C[buckyyowza: I think F2 is OK.  Black is thick enough to trust the center here, and should not welcome any incursion by white into this area of the board. Neglecting F2 would give white part of the lower side too easily (though it would be small for now).  F2 also increases the pressure on white's poorly formed corner shape.  From here, I would want to focus on keeping white cut by extending into the areas around F6 and M6 to follow up after this.

I think this is really a bad move, I should have play at A and chase the lonely white stone while surronding the left side...

What do you think ?];W[hp]
(;B[iq]LB[fn:A][gn:B]C[buckyyowza:  this is a bad move - it helps white without doing anything good for black.  Since white has cut black (with weak stones) It is urgent now to jump out at F6 to keep him cut as well.  G6 also looks possible, but since black is not entirely settled this seems a bit trickier.]
;W[fn];B[go];W[hq];B[ho]SQ[lf][mg][ng][mh][go][fp]C[buckyyowza: it seems funny, but the F4 group is actually closer to the N13 group than K3 is because there are no white stones in between.  Therefore I'd prefer to keep moving toward the center and connect to a base, for example at G6 here instead.]
;W[ip];B[ln];W[jm]C[buckyyowza: H7 is urgent now, and may not be enough.  Black really had to play at F6 earlier to save this situation.]
;B[kn]C[buckyyowza: another bad play, just like J3.  A peep is inappropriate when it encourages your opponent to kill your stones.]
;W[jn];B[ll]CR[nh][oh][pk][ol][om]LB[hm:A]SQ[go][ho][ep][fp]
[fq][fr]C[buckyyowza: exactly ;-)  However, it is even worse that you suspect!  The square stones are holding space along the side and corner, where the circle stones are holding it in the center.  If you also consider the aji of white connecting up the K6 dragon so soon, White easily comes out 30 points ahead in this exchange.

An other very bad move, I should have played at A.
Maybe the two white groups at the bottom and the right side could connect, but they have still no eye !

Here I make the exchange Circle stones against Square stones, and white is back in territory...

What do you think ?];W[hm];B[ej]C[buckyyowza: yes, black is in dire need of points now.  I agree with this choice.

Now I need to reduce white, or I'm not in the game any more (I think).]
;W[dl];B[eh];W[ji];B[ef];W[if];B[kd]LB[hc:A][jk:B]TR[ef][eh]
[ej]C[buckyyowza: white is over-extending now (probably feeling too confident).  It is not worth worrying about 2 stones here when your reduction is not yet connected.  Consider a play like H17 or K9 instead to keep the larger fight going.]

;W[hk];B[gk];W[fk];B[ik];W[hl];B[jj];W[ei];B[cg];W[di];B[gb]
LB[fc:A][di:B]C[buckyyowza:  agreed.  White should have played G18 at #106, which would have left a lot of play in this game and a slight edge for white.  Nonetheless, there is a lot to learn even from a short game against a careless opponent :)

It seems that black is too focused on local situations that capture 3 or 4 stones, and not enough on the big picture.  Often times that handful of stones is a huge win, but other times it is barely compensation for lost potential.  I like to think that it is not the places on the board with the stones that matters nearly so much as the places on the board without stones ;-).  In more practical terms, consider these priorities next time you play, and see if it helps:

1) first, settle your groups - preferably big or in sente.  A weak group cannot attack.
2) next, play thick.  that is, extend your strong groups into the center, and place your stones between your opponents to reduce their ability to connect.
3) finally, when all your groups are settled and thick, attack!  It is very difficult to resist the urge to attack before it is time, but when there is still stability and thickness to be gained those should sought after first or else the game becomes a struggle.

I hope you have enjoyed reading my comments, and have learned something from them.  Please let me know if you have any further questions about this game.

Mark

White resigns...

But if he had just took A instead of playing B, I think the game was pretty close.

Thank you very much for you comments and advices ;)])
(;B[fn];W[hn];B[fl]C[buckyyowza: now white has no strong base for his center stones, and white's left side is threatened.  Black is not 100% connected, but has little to worry about here.]
