C[Hello!

My name is Wojtek. I'm 10k KGS

I ask about commentary, because I need some help. I stuck at 10k and can't improve my play.

I had several games like this one, when I didn't make any serious mistake, thinking playing really good, but loosing in the end.

It would be helpful if You show me, what should I change and improve in my play.

(I played black stones)

 Hi,
My name is Guillaume and I reviewd this game for you. It was an interesting game to review.
To start I would like you to know that my ideas are from my point of view and are not nesecerly right. So please dont take anything I say for word but think about it, and if you dont agree then you probably have a good reason. 
  If there are any questions considering the comments please let me know ^^

There are a lot of people that play go and each player has a different level. This level rises as our efficiency rises. One becomes better as his moves become more efficient. I'm sure that if you keep that in mind while playing you could reach 8k without too much trouble.]

(;B[oq]LB[op:2][qp:A][oq:1]C[W: I've read that it's good move, but have a doubt if isn't it too defensive...

G: This is a great move, It builds influence and takes territory. But I wont say its the only move. The stone A can be used in other ways, but this is a matter of taste.

The stone A actualy controles the opponent, the opponents best attacking moves are around 1 an 2, with this in mind you could try playing on a bigger scale while making good use of the A stone. See the following possibilities:]
;W[qe];B[nd];W[qd];B[qc];W[pe];B[pc];W[mc]C[The sequence black played here was a nice leaning attack, but lets consider the other leaning attack too.

If black leans with N16 then there is still a weakness in blacks shape around P16 wich could turn out to be vital.

but what happens when black leans at P15...]
(;B[md];W[lc];B[ld];W[kc];B[qj];W[qh]
(;B[qm]LB[oj:1][qm:A]C[A is a bit slow, the best way to play here is by playing one. One will build a high framework and put more pressure on the white stones on the top right while A is a bit slower.]
;W[kd]
(;B[mg]
(;W[gc];B[cn];W[dn]C[One should try to keep an eye on the surroundings when playing go. Here is a very interesting situation. I would recommend black to play D7 now and build a stronghold on the right side. White tries to get the bottom but his evolution can not be optimal thanks to the corner enclosure that allows the possibility of a black stone to be played along the bottom.]

;B[ch];W[cj];B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[ee]LB[ef:A]C[A looks like a nice move here, what would happen if white cuts...]

(;B[eg];W[ef]
(;B[df]TR[ce][de]C[These three stones are now forming what we call an empty triangle. this shape is not very efficient and should be avoided. I would play D13 instead of D14]
;W[be];B[bf];W[ae];B[af];W[bc];B[dh];W[fg];B[fh];W[gg];B[ej]
;W[dk]LB[je:3][oe:2][eg:A][jq:1]C[The black group of stones A is pretty safe now and is hard to attack. It would be a perfect moment to take the inisiative and play a big move. One looks good, or you could play at 2 first to fix your shape and then play 3.]

(;B[dj];W[ci];B[di];W[bh];B[bg];W[ah];B[cg]C[This is the right idea ( urgent move before big move), with this move black is definatly alive and wont be a problem anymore.]
;W[jf];B[kq];W[iq];B[kn];W[in]
(;B[mk]LB[fl:A]C[W: now, I think it was too defensive. I was trying here to secure moyo and avoid invasion...

G: N9 is not a bad move but black can be a bit more offensive first, Black A Looks like a nice erasing move.]

C[this is a very nice move];W[rc];B[rb];W[sc];B[sb];W[re]
(;B[qa]C[This move could be replaced with the connecting move of O14.
R19 is like playing in your own territory here.];W[nb];B[ob]

;W[hh];B[hi];W[hg]
(;B[hj]LB[fl:A]C[Playing at A Is still very big];W[gl]C[Here is where the comments stop. I think that you played a very good game, in the end game black could be a bit more pushy and get more points, if you work on that and keep looking for the most effivient more you will surely get stronger very fast.

Enjoy the go world ^^

PS: F8 still works]
