C[Hello reviewer, thank you for your time and effort in looking over this game.
  I held black, and without a doubt, made many mistakes.
thanks again for looking over this game.

arlequ1: hi dedroid
Have a nice read with those comments. Hope you enjoy :)
 
summary:
- You both made joseki mistakes but it lead to interesting variations. This way the opening evened up :)
- You took back the lead with better fighting skills, but lost it against due to misreading.
- Your ideas were good, but need to be backed up by more reading.

-> your fighting skills seems ok but you need to improve your reading.
-> take great care of bad habits like thank-you-move (often sente moves).
     "sente is bad": no sente is a good thing, but when you exchange 2moves, you have to be sure that your opponent don't get more than you do :)

That's all, keep having fun playing go !

arlequ1: white is actually hard to attack. black can play A in sente to take territory or play anywhere around B to gain power in teh center. So it is better for black to live it as it is for now.]

This corner make this won game become a lost game :(
White took back the lead thanks to reading skills this time :)

(;B[fo]LB[en:A][iq:B]C[arlequ1: what about this move ? A and B becomes miai.
if white extend at B, black play at A which would be an awfull result for white (enclosed + broken + bad shape + e5 meaningless)
therefore, white has to extend at A and black can switch to attacking the white stones at m4. Note that c6 is far from being dead and still has a lot of potential.

Actually (see variation) f5 is a the point where white should have played. As the proverb says: "your vital point is my vital point".]
