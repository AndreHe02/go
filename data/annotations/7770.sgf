C[Hagios: This was an interesting game, played against someone who uses a style that I have a hard time against.  Thanks in advance for the review!

Hey there, so sorry for taking so long with review. Couldnt get java to work with me. 

  I think you could improve greatly with your fighting and positional judgement which basically go together. Reading is always important as well. I feel when you got into trouble, you really got into trouble and when white got into trouble, he got off easy. I'm not very good at calculating yose and stuff but I feel white was in control of the endgame. With better reading you might be able to play more "riskier" moves than small safe moves. 

If you have any questions you can email me or msg me on KGS. My username is dN.21death though I dont come on often anymore xD. I think it says I'm [3d\]? I'm somewhere around there lol. I'm not that much stronger but I'll try my best to help. 

Good luck!];B[pd]C[tobe30k [1d\]: hi, gg];W[qp];B[dc];W[cn]
;B[ce]C[H: This is my favorite fuseki as B, but c6 is a bit worrisome since I'm bad at playing against such high moves...

- Well you can always try finding other big moves to play thats not there.]
;W[jc]
(;B[op];W[lq]C[H: I admit, I don't know much about this pincer, so I probably didn't play the best moves here...]
(;B[pn]C[- This is interesting. This is a joseki but maybe it's just my preference but I would go to the corner.  I'll show some more joseki.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[rn];B[hc]C[H: My judgement is, the right side is now low, so h17 is the best way to approach W.  n17, p17 is favorable for W, and if o17, then the normal joseki after m17 should be good as well.

-Ya approaching from left side was always good anyways because you had the shimari there.]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[qf]LB[pb:A][kd:B]C[H: I expected A, but W instead played B.  I thought that I came out ahead because of this.

- R14 isn't bad but I might of played Q14 if you wanted to attack more. A and B are both good moves if played correctly. W played it safe but keeping his stones connected.]
;W[kd];B[pb]
(;W[ob]C[- W didn't fix his weakness well here but if he did he would of been fine.]
;B[qc];W[lo]C[H: Now I know there's aji at n16, but in the game I didn't get to extract my stone.  The aji ended up being worth quite a few points in the endgame, though.

- Yes, W played the wrong move.  I was trying to find a place you can play here so you don't have to play again.. They aren't as solid as your move though.]
;B[nn];W[lm];B[pp]C[- I don't see why you played this move, maybe even a big jump out would of been good. I guess this is sente but you still can be attacked.]
;W[rq]LB[dp:A][dq:B][eq:C][fq:D]C[H: Now I feel I have to invade the bottom-left.  I considered all of the options below.  D seemed the best choice, to me.

- I liked B or C. D lets him make a shimari in sente.]
(;B[fq]LB[cq:A]C[I imagined that W could play at A, and it would revert to a normal joseki, with a different order.]
;W[dq]C[- I like this for W.];B[iq];W[nl]C[H: Now I'm a little unhappy  about my group, but I feel confident that I can live with m2 if need be...

-Hoping for M2 is a very bad decision. It weakens your bottom left group greatly.]
