C[In this game I played as white.

My opponent is much stronger than I am.  I played as best as I could.  I would like to know how I could have responded to his moves better.

Thanks.

Ben: In the email I received it said I should review for the black side but you say your white.  In the light of the discrepancy I decided to review this for both sides (in all I believe that it would probably be beneficial to have an understanding of where you opponent went wrong as well).]
;B[pp];W[pc];B[dp];W[de]
(;B[qi]LB[pc:X]C[Ben: This move is a bit wishy washy.  I have a feeling I know why you played it.  If white were to make an approach on r-6 he would then be overconcentrated correct?  Well in this case getting an approach on X accomplishes that and this so it should be prefered.]
;W[jq]CR[qf][pg][cn][fq][nq]C[Ben: White has a rather unusual pattern along the top so it is difficult to judge the best move.  I marked with circles some possible alternatives with no mention as to their quality (experiment with these moves in other words and see if they work with your style).]

(;B[ci]TR[jq]C[Ben: See my discussion for move 5. 
Another alternative would be to approach white's marked stone right away.]
;W[nq];B[qn]
(;W[fq]C[Ben: Really white ought to complete his first two stones development first.]

(;B[hq];W[fo];B[cn];W[dr]
(;B[cq]C[Ben: At this point I would try to do something with my invasion stone.]
;W[ip];B[gp]C[Ben: It is sometimes better to wait for other developments before attempting to live with a stone like this.  In fact I am not sure it is possible in this static position with no other black influence in the area.]
;W[fp];B[go];W[gn];B[ho];W[gq]
(;B[hp];W[im]
(;B[pe]C[Ben: Really d-17 or the move on k-6 I mentioned previously are the biggest areas.]
;W[qe]
(;B[qf]C[Ben: I would probably try a different joseki here since this one only leaves black concentrated.]

(;B[cc]C[Ben: This is a very difficult move to judge accurately.  I found something of a tesuji for black.]
;W[ed]
(;B[fe];W[be]
(;B[bd];W[bb]C[Ben: White is probably going to win this group regardless of the alternatvies now.]
;B[df];W[ad];B[np];W[pq]
(;B[qq];W[op];B[oo];W[oq];B[qp];W[mp];B[lc]C[Ben: Its difficult to suggest better.  The area is big but it allows white to attack.  Perhaps something like p-10 trying to goad w to invade first would be worth a try.]
;W[lf]C[Ben: Black can live quite easily so this move I would probably dismiss as a possibility.]

(;B[nf]TR[pe][pf]LB[ne:a][jc:b]C[Ben: This move is a little submissive.  Consider how the extension works from the marked stones (since this move seems more like a territory seeking move).  White's move has had good effect.

The a variation is kind of a cosmic variation, the b variation seeks immediate life.]
;W[md];B[jc];W[id];B[ke];W[kd]C[Ben: Black's position is a total shambles now.  I can see nothing spectacular happening for him in this sector.

The remainder of the game I feel you did as best you could (if your black!).  Black is just to far behind to put up enough of a fight.  No more comments.]

;B[qf];W[qd];B[pf];W[nc];B[qj]C[Ben: The marked stone is doing two things now.  It's marking a base for r-14 and will help concentrate any approach moves from your opponent.
On a side note approach moves from o-3 can be answered assuredly by q-6.]
