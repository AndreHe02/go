C[This is my game, it was played in the German "Bundesliga". My colour ist black. Thank you very much for reviewing!
I have written a number of questions. But please focus on the mistakes YOU think are the most important ones, even if I did not write a question about it!!

Comments by reviewer are preceded by SGF:];B[pd]C[Westf1Br4 [-\]: Ebenso, 1 Dan hatte ichg vergessen]
;W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[op];W[qk]TR[qh][qn]C[I think this white move i unusual, but how should I answer it?

SGF:  Yes, it is certainly more common to play at R10.  My initial inclination is to ignore it and play in the lower left.  After all, it seems misplaced and does not provide a good follow up for W.  See how the game develops before deciding how to play.  After all, W is not likely to play at the triangle point any time soon and a longer extension toward the top corner will leave a weakness behind.]
;B[qh]C[SGF:  I don't  like this.  It feels like an inbetween move. Extending one more or one less feels better.  But as commented on the previous move, I would prefer to ignore it.]
;W[qn];B[do];W[cm];B[cq]LB[en:A][cp:B]C[SGF:  I think I would prefer to play the variation starting with A.  There are dozens of possibilities after A, with no typical outcome.  But with the common variation after wB it is white who gets strength down the side and blacks ends up with a position at the bottom which has weaknesses.]
;W[cp];B[dp];W[co];B[cn];W[dn];B[bn];W[bq];B[cr];W[bo];B[bm]

(;W[br]LB[eq:A]C[SGF: This is a bad move.  W should play A first and then come back to this.]
;B[ao];W[bp];B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[cs];B[cl];W[dm]C[I thought the result in this corner was better for me, what was the mistake my opponent did?

SGF: See my previous comment.];B[dl];W[fm];B[fo]C[correct?

SGF: Well, I am not a pro, so I cannot say it is correct.  But it is what I would have played.]
;W[el];B[dj];W[ch]
(;B[ek]LB[dh:A]C[SGF: I thought quite a bit about this move.  In the end I decided I did not like it.  I think it make it too easy for W to make a decent shape.  I am not convinced it is wrong, but I think A is worth considering. See the variation.]
;W[fk];B[fj];W[gk];B[gj];W[hk]LB[cf:A][ei:B]C[SGF:  I think that W is now safe.  There are too many directions to run for W to be considered at risk.  It is true that there is an invasion at A for black to look at, but as long as the move at B is available to white he can probably deal with it. Future development will have to take this into consideration.   The problem with this position as it stands is that the black stones at the bottom are very weak and need immediate help, but the stones on the left can easily be attacked.]
;B[pm]C[I am not sure is an exchange like that good or bad for me?

SGF:  White can consider ignoring this and attack the lower left.  If that happens it is likely that white will have sente to come back to this.  See the variation.for the next move.]

(;W[qm];B[jq]C[too low? better attack the white center group?

SGF:  The white center group is very flexible so it is hard to attack without building up a stronger position on the outside.  White probably should not have answered the previous move.  I think I would be inclined to play this move on the 4th line to increase the potential attack on the white stones.  This move allows white to press to make shape.]
;W[ei];B[ej];W[bk];B[bl];W[gn]LB[hj:B][hp:A]C[SGF:  I don't think the two previous white moves did anything useful.  If anything they were aji keshi.  This move it threatening a move at A, but is it the best?  If white can live a deeper invasion is a remote possibility so I consider this move to also be aji keshi.  I think a simple move at B is better.]
;B[go];W[hj]C[SGF:  So, did white gain anything by the previous exchange?]
;B[gh];W[hi];B[eh];W[dh]
(;B[di]C[F11 better, not to give white E13??

SGF: See variation.];W[eg];B[fh];W[hh];B[fc]LB[bi:A]C[overplay?

SGF: I think I would want to preserve the option to invade at the 4-4.  How about living with A and seeing how it develops?]
;W[fd]LB[bj:A]C[SGF: D17 would be my preference.  White A is still available so black does not have two eyes.  Take territory while maintaining the possibility of a splitting again between the dragon and F17.]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[ec];W[dc]C[SGF: White is not strong enough to play this while maintaining an attack in the left blacok group.  This basically removes pressure from the group, which is not good.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[fe];W[ef];B[gd]LB[ce:B][de:A]C[SGF: I don't understand the point of the A-B exchange.  If black were connected it would be a different matter, but white can split.]
;W[gf]C[TriLux [-\]: teuer f√ºr S];B[ff];W[fg];B[gg];W[ge];B[fd]
C[connect or play H13?

SGF:  If you are going to play H13 then it should have been done immediately instead of F14.  That would have been better.  Also, H13 now lets white capture two stones and black has nothing in the top left.]

If you see any in the following moves please correct me!!^^]

(;B[jc];W[kd];B[ke]C[SGF:  This is an overplay.  Black does not need to capture these two stones to win the game.  The next few moves are a one-way street.]

SGF:  I showed some variations that I saw.  Best I could find for black was a sente seki.]

(;B[on]C[SGF:  Based on the variations to the last move it is probably better to play in the top left in sente.]

SGF:  I think so.  Somewhere round about A looks more promising.]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[rq];B[db];W[cb];B[ea]C[SGF: Black finally got to D18 and prevents the potential seki.  Going back to the center now seems bigger.]
;W[ca]C[SGF:  Seems small.  Black can still cut in the endgame.]
