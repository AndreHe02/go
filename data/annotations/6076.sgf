AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[[Brian\] Thank you for taking the time to review this.  I would appreciate any comments you might have on this game.  I (and my opponent) would particularly be interested in comments about improving play in the opening, as well as how to play better shape.

Max- I provided the best commentary I could. It's hard to judge opening and shape with a high handicap game like this.]
;W[fd];B[hd];W[df];B[dh];W[cc];B[fc];W[ed]C[Max- D17 a more usual move. Black perhaps should have gone there.]

(;B[ec];W[dc];B[de];W[ee]C[[Brian\] Ugly shape, but it seemed necessary.  What would have been a better way to handle this?

Max- Not as far as I see. You could threaten the other two stones w. g17, but I think that would have worked against you.]
;B[ef];W[ce];B[dg]
(;W[cf]C[You should just capture so that g16 isn't sente.];B[gd]
;W[cd];B[gb]C[This was unneccesary on black's part. He should play f14 or some similiar sealing move or tenuki.]
;W[cj]
(;B[ch]C[Max- This seems rather slow. Cuts off the c10 stone, but w. so much room to run or make a base, so what?]
;W[cm];B[cn];W[dn];B[co];W[ej]LB[dm:A]C[Max- This is not a real threat to black. As black, I would cut at A immediately.  This sort of play is maybe necessary in a handicap game, but will backfire on you in even games.]
;B[fh];W[fq];B[er];W[eq];B[dq];W[fo];B[hq];W[jq]C[Max- A pincer seems a bit much here. You don't have much development potential and black has room to run. I would likely tenuki. Still, it's a high handicap game so I can't say it's necessarily bad.]
;B[ho];W[gm];B[hm];W[mq]C[[Brian\] This seemed the safe extension; too cautious?

Max- No, I would say it is necessary.];B[oq];W[nc]LB[qf:A]C[Max- better to have approached on this side as you have more room to work with.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[kc];B[qj];W[qn]C[[Brian\] It seemed important to invade the right side quickly at this point.

Max- Yes, the right side is getting large.];B[qq];W[on]C[[Brian\] In retrospect, R8 might have been better, but it seemed at the time that, since I was going to have to run out with this group anyway, it would be better to ensure that I could.

Max- Black couldn't seal you in with just one move so running out wasn't as important yet.]
;B[ql];W[pl];B[no];W[nn];B[pg]
(;W[pk]C[Max- This just strengthens black.];B[qk];W[nk];B[lo]
;W[jo]C[[Brian\] I thought it likely that I would end up sacrificing the K3-N3 stones, as trying to save them seemed like it would run the risk of strengthening Black and risking the O6 stones.  What would have been a better way to handle this?

Max- It would have been better to tie your two weak groups together earlier. Sacrificing is fine, if you get enough in compensation. Fortunately, you get lucky later on.]
;B[jn];W[ff]LB[ld:A][ke:B][dm:C]C[Max- This if very slow. Black should have gone elsewhere (m16, l15 and d7 come to mind).]
;B[gf];W[je]C[Max- I'd rather have seen you make a base here.]
;B[lq];W[kn];B[ko];W[km];B[jl]C[Max- Black is just asking to be cut. Good that you obliged.]
;W[jm];B[in];W[im]
(;B[jp]LB[hl:A]C[Max- I would call this a cowardly move. Black should have played A.]

;W[ke];B[ld];W[lc];B[me];W[hh];B[mc];W[mb];B[gg];W[li];B[ji]
;W[jk];B[fj];W[fk];B[gj];W[gk];B[ei];W[di]C[[Brian\] D10 seems like it would have been a better response, as it leaves more potential for a move at B12.

Max- It also doesn't leave black the cut at F9];B[ci];W[dj]
;B[eg];W[ib]C[Max- Finally, a base. It would have been rough for you if black had gotten k18 in.]
;B[jd];W[kd];B[jc];W[jb];B[ie];W[hc]C[Max- Nice way to take advantage of a weakness. Black should let the k17 stones go. It's only 4 points for you in gote.]

;B[go];W[eo];B[gn];W[fn];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr];W[rf]C[[Brian\] This didn't look promising, but I thought I was slightly behind at this point, and it looked like there was potential here.]
;B[rd];W[qi];B[qh];W[ri];B[rh]
(;W[pj];B[pi];W[rj];B[rk];W[kh];B[jh];W[bm]C[Max- This was a huge move. Covers the weakness at d7, begins to make territory, and is sente.]
;B[bo];W[bh]C[[Brian\] Let's chalk this move up to time pressure.]
