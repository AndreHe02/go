AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[I play this game against manay faces of go 11.0
it was at level 7 because i don't see a big difference with the level 10 except the time it take.

i don't know my level but at my go club, i play a 15Kyu with a 4 stones handicap and each game end with a very few differents of points.

xxc : i'm the reviewer, and as you let many comments, i'll (try to) answer ... forgetting the usual white/black do, must, should ...   White Black Handicap Komi

15k 15k 0 5.5
15k 16k 1 0.5
15k 17k 2 0.5
15k 18k 3 0.5
 ...

Here is for level.];W[qj]C[it always start with a middle third line stone.

xxc : do not forget it is a soft !!!];B[dj]C[usualy, i always play the san-ren-sei near this white stone because i'm afraid it kill one of the 2 corner.
here, it would be K16 or K4 but because i always lost with this move, i try to do it different this time.

xxc : D10 is ok
One thing about corners.
4x4 stones job is not to grab the corner, but to wait for an invasion at 3x3 and build thickness ... to strike elsewhere. Of course, with a few more stones, 4x4 gives a big corner :)]
;W[jq];B[jd];W[fq];B[dn]C[the only response i know. I read it's the normal way to play.

xxc : it can be ok with D10 already here, but it leaves a weakness at C8]

(;W[qn]
(;B[np]C[again

xxc : here, i prefer a low stone at O3 or even N3 (but N3 seems to near white). With O4, your target might be the center latter.]

(;W[pl]C[xxc : this one is small]
(;B[qg]TR[pd][qg]C[here i try to push white in a small part of the edge and keep the corner.

I was a little afraid of a play like N6 wich seal my 2 stones bottom right corner.

xxc : so ... why not M3 ?
Extend from your 2 stones weak group, secure arround 15 points, make presure on the weaker left white group ... all that in one stone is cool :)

Be carrefull, the 2 marked stones do not secure perfectly the corner.]
;W[md]
(;B[jc]C[here, i try to keep white to go bellow my stone.

I think there is a way to play N14 or N15, but not at the level i am at this time.

xxc : it's a strong move ... TOO strong. There is no fear to have from one stone at this stage of the game.]
;W[mf]
(;B[oh]TR[md][mf]C[run in the center.
it force (i think) white to choose one of the 2 the group to keep connecting to the center.

xxc : right white group is alive ... you play a "dame" ... no points here, but it can be ok because marked stones are under presure and it offers a way out for the corner (it could be usefull).]
;W[ke]
(;B[je]C[go to the center and guard my left part.
May be K14 better ?

xxc : it's not in the way you play K18 !
You can't have anything and you have to choose ... you can't prevent white from going under your stones, from going toward the center while securing territories and flying to the center yourself ... it's not possible.]
;W[lh]
(;B[kf]C[i think i try to cut it in two, but i'am not sure.

May be O10 better, but after white could go to the left side with something like K13 ?]
;W[nh]
(;B[of]C[try to live with some territory.

xxc : ok, it's clear now you have to look at your corner, but try to extend first, there is still enought space to make eyes, this stone does not really help the corner.]
;W[jh];B[hf]C[i think this prevent white to seal my stone in the up side

xxc : you are right, but not yet, white can't do that with one stone, but now you have to understand what white has done and keep an eye on the center ... and on your 2 stones group at the lower right corner]
;W[lc]C[xxc : i do not understand this move];B[oc]TR[kf][of]
[oh]C[keep the corner, and try to keep connected with the K17 group

xxc : ok for the corner ... but you can't connect with K17.

Now have a look at the marked stones ... they are useless.]
;W[oi];B[ph]C[xxc : this stone is not important, you can let it and have a move elsewhere.]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[keep white small in the corner

xxc : not sure white can live here ...];W[hp]
(;B[nn]C[go to the center, with possibility to connect with the others group

xxc : ok, why not extend before at M3 ?];W[kd]C[xxc : it's really small]
;B[kc]TR[cc][fc][cf][hh][ko][rp][eq][lq][dr]C[xxc : don't answer this move ... you have a lot of big moves at the marked spot ... extend or reinforce.]
;W[lb];B[le]C[maybe to early, i really think it connect but not

xxc : it's only 4 points, it's small.];W[me];B[ld]C[at this time i did'nt see the monkey jump from M18.

xxc : too small ...];W[ni];B[pi]C[xxc : too small];W[pj];B[lq]
C[push white to keep the corner

xxc : more than that ... it gives more eye space to your group]
;W[dg]LB[cc:2][fe:1][cl:3]TR[bb][gc][rd][bl][bq][or]SQ[lk][rl]
[hr]C[xxc : ok white is comming in the trap :)

You are strong all arround, so you have to choose where you want to drive this white stone and why.

Triangle spots are your patential points, square are white's.
D13 is high (4 th line) and your weakness are marked with numbers.

Let's s how to go on with this.]
(;B[fe]C[keep the edge.

may be F13 better to prevent white to connect

xxc : corner still possible for white];W[eh];B[hh];W[cl]C[xxc : here is C8, you remember ?]
;B[dl]C[here, i never know if i need to prevent white to go to the center or if i need to choose one of the two side for territory (with C7 or C10).

xxc : here, you made a wall facing the center. White have not so much points and you have more ... i think it's ok]
;W[ce];B[cd]C[keep the corner];W[de]
(;B[fj]C[connect left side with the upper side

xxc : you don't have to connect or cut two living groups.
Upper group is alive.
Left group have eye space in the corner and can join  the center

Maybe time to play a solid move to prevent problems latter]
;W[bd];B[bc]
(;W[be]C[xxc : white could have been more dangerous here];B[cc]
;W[bj];B[ck]C[try to cut in two.]
(;W[bh];B[bk]C[it let me cut

xxc : can white do something else ?];W[dr];B[cq]LB[gi:4][dk:1]
[cl:2][im:5][bn:3]TR[dj][fj][bk][ck][dl][dn][dp][cq]C[get space to live

xxc : you should not think like that ... not with such a group. The marked group is really difficult to kill even without the stone you just add.

1 and 2 can be eye
3 and arround is already space
4 connect
and flying toward 5 is also possible.

Here, with C3 you answer white move as you should ... but it's about points, not about life. Next big move here for points is C2, bigger for black, but latter ... now, there are other things to do elswhere.]

xxc : ko for white wins 20 pts, for black is 22 pts ... so it is rather big for both. Ko always difficult to manage ...]
;W[ir]C[thank, it respond. because i don't think i could sucess the invade.]
;B[sq];W[cr]C[i think this was not very important and let me kill the bottom right corner.

xxc : ok, your group still alive !!!];B[rr]C[I was happy. it's the first time i got a real ko and win it like a tsumego.

Since this group is alive, i can now be more aggressive from this area to invade the center.
