C[Biondy [9k?\]: please
septa [-\]: Have fun


Dear reviewer, my name is Biondy 9k? in KGS and 14k in IGS, so I might made some move that 9k won't make.  This game is  my game in KGS against septa (4k).

If you read some conversations that you don't understand, don't think about it. It's just our mothertongue and have no part in game.

please your help.

*:
Hi Biondy,

I am IgoShinKen, 5K+ on IGS; I'll try to answer your questions and review your game on move per move.  So if I say move should be played and you played it later it just means your timing needs to be adjusted.  I'll always try to give examples for my reasoning and over all lessons to be learned at the end of the game.  

Take everything I say with a grain of salt; I am by far not the strongest.  So what I say today might prove me to wrong the next week (I am learning everyday too).  Anyhow, all my computers will start with *:, I hope you enjoy the review.

IgoShinKen.

*: First sweep through the game, no review just seeing your playing style you are rushed.  Take a breather and count and adjust your play.  And life and death is one of the MOST important things.  I recommend you get accesss to the GoBase.org website and do the life and death problems there and the Dashn.com they really helped me.  Also when doing life and death problems after you find the right answer; read the entire answer from start to end move by move to improve your reading.  If you are confident of your reading for right answer, take one move back and read again to see what if you played else where, what would the out come be.]
;B[pe];W[dd];B[eq]CR[oq][qo][co]C[Biondy [9k?\]: sry lag

is this the right  spot? or should be at o?

*: I don't like 5-17 (E3).  It's bad direction.  Your purpose of 16-5 (Q15) is to force white to approch at 16-3 (Q17) so you can force white down and build on the outside.  So thats the reason for 16-5; but the reason for 5-17 is you want the bottom or right side; which is bad idea because then you might give white moyo on the left side.

*: Moyo are not bad when they work for you but most of time they hurt; so avoid giving your opponent chance to make moyo.  So in that regards I recommend 3-15 (C5), 4-16 (D4), or 4-15 (D5); all those have the same affect.  3-15 being my chooice of move.  Each move depends on your style.


*: To add comments about 15-17 (P3) and 17-15 (R5); they would be right area if you wanted to have a moyo fight but a good move their is 16-16 (Q4) which works wonders for 16-5 (Q15).]
;W[op]C[septa [-\]: gpp];B[qp]C[*: Good move; bad chooice by white with black at E3.]
;W[pn]C[*: errr this going to get nasty, his going to try to trick you.

*: Simple continuation is shown in example.];B[oq]
(;W[pq]C[*: Gets complicated ...];B[pp];W[qq];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp]
;W[or];B[nq]
(;W[oo]C[*:Greedy Mistake.];B[nr]C[I don't know if this is a good move or not. I don't know the joseki here, but maybe s6 is better

*: I don't know joseki either but look at the example thats one of the pro game patterns I have seen.  To me this is a Really good move.]
;W[qo];B[os];W[qr];B[qs];W[ro]C[Biondy [9k?\]: wheewww... strange 4 me
septa [-\]: me too
Biondy [9k?\]: these all];B[sr];W[rs];B[pr];W[ps];B[or];W[po]
;B[qs];W[dp]LB[cq:B][cp:A]C[strange. I never play against this approach. Usually people will play a or b (which I think a is right, because a proverb say:"enter komoku against mokuhazushi ASAP"

what's the best reaction here?(but I think this move is much more like ko threat

*: Yeap just a ko-threat, but as poverb goes in early game their are no ko-threats; you have to ignore.]
;B[ss]C[*: White is at a lose :(.];W[ep]
(;B[fq]C[*: no you are helping white, proverb hane at the head of two stones comes to mind but it's not good here.  But then again either is 6-17 (F3).  You have to fight, you can't let white build up a moyo.]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[dq];B[cj]C[*: Normally I would say great move .. but after D3 it just lost it's appeal to me :(.   either way white defends he will be will be okay I think.  To me this move has only one reason split white, and it does a very weak job of it.  You should attack 16-15 (Q5) group first at 16-11 (Q9).]
;W[cl];B[cg];W[ce];B[jc]C[*: Nice idea, but somewhat lacking Honte (Honset move); should be around 4-10.]
;W[gc]MA[ec][eb]C[*: Please note this move has a weakness at 5-2 and 5-3 that can be explited later on.]

(;B[mc]C[Biondy [9k?\]: is it too slow?
Biondy [9k?\]: just ur opinion
septa [-\]: i dont think so

I ask ur opinion too.

*: Yes slow, it doesn't protect the corner or attack, it creates 8 points when you have a huge move at 16-11 (Q9).  I agree you have to do something in response to 8-3 (G17), but I think it should start with attack please look at example.]
;W[iq];B[hp];W[jp]
(;B[kq]C[*: Bad attack, what are you defending there?  few points?  why not play 12-15 (M5) to attack white's both groups at the same time?]
;W[jn];B[io]C[*: A thank-you move for white, he wants to be soild there; it looks like you will be helping your stones at 8-14 (H7) next but it's not good because you need to run to make life.]
;W[jo];B[hm];W[go]C[*: This hurts....]
(;B[in]C[*: not good answer should be 8-15 (H5).];W[fm]
(;B[jm]C[the escaping here is very hard 4 me and giving white too much profit. What is the best way here?

*: Playing 10-13 (K7) is just being nice to white but if you try to go at 8-11 (H9) you will just hurt your group at 3-10 (C10).  So Please look at my example.]
;W[km];B[jl];W[gk]
(;B[jj]C[*: Wrong you have to hane at 11-12 (L8).];W[ik];B[jk]
C[*: Don't give white what he wants, play your own game.  11-12 (L8).]
;W[pg];B[pj]TR[pc]C[another strange approach. usually people take Q17, but well, experimenting is nice too

what's the best way 2 response here?

*: Note strange when you take bottom stones into account. But def greedy.  I think your move is good balance.]
;W[oe];B[od]C[*: I think this should be 16-4 (Q16), keep it simple; when attached; when strong extend. when weak hane.  This is because hane lets white make things complicated.]
;W[of];B[qd];W[nj]C[*: This hurts now :(.];B[qh];W[qg];B[ri]

MA[lc][ci][ja][jb][ch][kc][nc][qf][si][mq][lq][kr][ks][sp][er]
[es][gs][gr][bj][aj][ag][bg]C[*: Okay your group will probably live but .. lets count now ....

Black: Top: 34 Bottom: 14 Left: 4, Total: 52

White: Top: 19 Bottom: 32 Right: 11, Total: 62

White is already 10 ahead and has potention for alot more.  Lets continue....]
;W[ld];B[lc];W[kd];B[kc];W[lk];B[dr];W[cr];B[es];W[hr]
(;B[hl]C[*: I don't like this move because if forces white to do something I don't want him to do;  or at least do it when he feels like it's being forced.  Beside your group is strong so it's too soon for it.]
;W[hk];B[il]C[a wasted move by me. I forgot the H6 move

*: Yeap 8-14 (H6) is there but, no biggy. Black has many ways to live.]
;W[hn]
(;B[fr]C[another wasted move

*: Yes ... this is not needed.  6-11 (F9) Is the next move please look at my example.]
;W[hh];B[ki]MA[mf][bl][ql][lm]C[*: too slow, start at 12-10 (M10). You are way way behind .. yave to do something stronger ... Please note the marked points any of those are good start to reducing white and helping you.  Your group does only have one eye but it's not in an imediate danger; so you should reduce at one of the marked points.]
;W[li]
(;B[jh]C[*: Bad Shape; a hanging connection at 10-8 (K12) doesn't help because you need to get three of the 4 points around that ponnuki to make it an eye, you need to play lighter; Please look at my example.]
;W[ii];B[kj]C[*: Nice try; but  this isn't enough here.];W[lh]
;B[jf];W[kg];B[jg]C[Level 1

*: ?? Level 1?  Anyhow look at your group on the left it's looking very lonely right now.]
;W[je]
(;B[jd]C[I misread here

*: Please look at my example.];W[ie];B[hg];W[fh];B[hf];W[he]
;B[fg];W[eg]C[*: Very tough place no easy way to make life without hurting the group on the left :(.]

(;B[gh]C[*: This makes white too strong ...];W[gi];B[gg];W[eh]
;B[ef];W[df];B[ee];W[ge];B[ff];W[kf];B[dg];W[de];B[fd];W[fc]
;B[ih]C[*: SAVE ^_^, good job; but white might be too strong for left group now.]
;W[hi];B[if]TR[cj][dg][cg]C[I'm lucky that I make to alive here, but another prblem is the marked stones]
;W[bk]C[*: yeap that hurts now lets see what we can do, please look at example]

(;B[bj]C[to be honest I have quite problems with life and death. How to revive my group here?

*: Please look at my example.  Not a good start when you want to make group alive you have to play light not heavy like 2-10.]
;W[bf];B[bg]C[*: heavy again you are lost your only chances.]
;W[ck];B[ah];W[di];B[ci];W[dh];B[aj];W[ch];B[ed];W[ec];B[dc]
;W[cc];B[md];W[mf];B[ip];W[jq];B[gn];W[fn]TR[ho]C[why whte didn't connect at H5?

*: he was trying to be nice, or he didn't read just played for the hell of it.  Saving one stone doesn't get him anything.  But other then that I don't see any benfit for him to play it this way.  His not in danger.

But as the Japanese proverb says Rich man don't pick fights.  White is way ahead he doesn't want to do something stupid this late and lose the game.]
;B[ho];W[pk];B[ni];W[mi];B[oj]C[*: YOu got to stop making this kind of move all it does is makes white strong.]

;W[rf];B[ng];W[mg]C[oh... my last possibility just gone. We still continue this game w/ a ko fight, but not very important, so you could end your review here.

*: He hoping for anything else is wishful thinking.  Okay on your request I'll stop here.  So here is summary of things you need to work on to improve your game (to my understanding)...

1) Stop playing your opponents game; you need to take sente and use it.
2) Don't start family fights like between your center group and left group.  WHen you do one will DIE.
3) Don't play heavy when under attack; play light this way you maybe can give up few stones in exchange for life.
4) Empty tringles can be a good move but only about 20% of the times; other times it's usually bad and helps opponet get stronger.  So think carefully before you play these kind of moves.
5) Your starting in the bottom right corner was great; but you didn't use your stones properly so it back fired.
6) Don't play soo many moves on 3rd line like at 6-17 (F3) group; when you have no potentinal of expanding on the side you are playing don't invest soo many moves their because you are asking for invasion which you might not be able to handle like what white did.
7) Admitting that you have weak life and death is always good; I recommend getting the 1001 Life and Death problems it's a good book; or practice on www.goproblems.com; or www.gobase.org; or www.dashn.com all these sites have good practice problems.
8) When confused about where to play next follow the following guidlines:
- Check for weak groups you have (help them).
- Check for weak groups your opponent has (attack them).
- Make a corner closer.
- Make an extention form side.
- Go in to the center.

These are the general guidelines that can help.  But if they don't answer your question for example last three don't help when you are in late midgame or on words.  At that time take a  good look to see whos ahead and behind and adjust your playing style accordingly.

I think some places you need to play more agressively some more defensively; both are only possible if you know the score.
9) Last but not least study your shapes; you can read the Shape Up! on gobase.org or get the Making Good Shapes book; both will help your form greatly.

Well I hope this helps a bit; sorry I couldn't be more detail.  But if you have any question feel free to mail me back.  Thanks!]
