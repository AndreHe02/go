C[Hi.  I am looking for general comments.  In this game, I get a good start, but perhaps I play too dangerously, and in my opponent manages to turn the game around with a fight in the end.  I think mainly my tactics need work, but any comments are welcome.  Thanks for taking the time to look over my game.

-Calvin


This game had allot more potential than was played into.  This game was lost by bad shape in the fuseki and early chuuban.  You were forced to defend more than attack.

The 1st 20 - 30 moves are the most important in the whole game, as they can decide who wins and loses.  More work on fuseki is required.

Always give purpose to your stones.  A place to live, a place to go, or something to do.

Do not directly attack someones stones, as 1 weak stone can become strong very fast.  If you attack from  father away like in move 17, you wlll get much stronger.

The game of go is not about killing everything you see, but about balance.  Equal exchanges are better than any kill.]

A - H are all local

I and J are also allowed, and make a good tenuki.]
(;W[dk]LB[ci:B][en:D][eo:E][bp:G][cp:H][fp:F][cq:C][fq:A]C[I pincer here because I think black is looking for the mini-chinese (if white A, black B), which I don't like so much.


The 44 point low approach, two-space high pincer is never a bad move

A C D G H reviewed here.

B and H are not desirable.

D G are the same bit in a different order]
(;B[cp]C[This is wrong move and was punished well];W[cq];B[co]
LB[bq:A][dq:B]C[Black's options are usually A and B.  I don't think connecting like this is joseki.]
;W[bq]C[I decide to reduce black's base.   Maybe they are better ideas.

This is REAL bad, black has bad shape due to the lack of a base.  White made the proper coice of moves here.]
;B[bp]C[Play on the second line is never desirable.  Although you need to make life before you run or attack, this move is very small.]
;W[gq]C[So far, I think this result is good for white.

This is the best result for white now, base/life.  You left black in bad shape.]
;B[ch]LB[oc:C][jd:D][od:B][ce:F][de:E][ck:A]C[You are correct, A is too small, there are many larger moves on the board.  Just having D9 there seperates the stones without having to add A

B/C reviewed at move 5/6]
(;W[ck]LB[od:A]C[This separates black, but may be a little slow.  It could be that I can tenuki at A, for example.

I can say this is where your game fell apart.];B[em]
(;W[ce]LB[gl:A]C[This may be an overplay.  Maybe it is better to surround black and run out with A?

A is wrong and I think this is too, by wasting a move at C9 you are now falling behind with 2 weak groups]
;B[de]LB[df:A][cg:B]TR[ch]C[this stone is weak, it stays weak as long as you do not attack it directly.  B makes it stronger. A makes it weaker and black should respond to defend]

My thinking is that the marked group is already strong, because white can't hane at B due to the clamp at C, so I tihnk I'm attaching to a strong to stone to widen my path before running out.]

IMHO F is in the middle of nowhere, and A and B are better for attacking and making your shape.]
