C[Dear reviewer,



Perhaps it was because of the big territories and dead groups, but I was under the constant belief that I was losing until the end. Even now I still don't understand why I won the game. Was it because white had given me too much influence in the upper left? Whatever the cause, please help me determine it. Naturally I'm also interested in any mistakes my opponent or I made.



Thx,

As u have probably gathered from the conversation above, W2 was misclick. White had to patch up his mistake, giving me an advantage.

R: This stone is low, but solid. I think black can play elsewhere. Black can later use reducing technique at star point.]

(;B[cd]C[Do u think I should have been attacking W2?];W[do]
C[R: High corner enclosure should be better. Note black can play at san-san later, for instance.]

(;B[oq]C[R: This is wrong direction, see variant];W[qq]
(;B[fp]C[R: It helps white to strenghten his position directly, so it should be regarded as aji-keshi]
