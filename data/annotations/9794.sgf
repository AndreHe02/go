Daniel: Hi!  Thanks for reviewing my game!  I played as Black.  I put my comments/questions in the sgf prefaced with "Daniel:"  The area I'm most interested in comments on is the fight beginning at move 79.  I think I should have died but got lucky from a W mistake.  Despite living, I didn't get a good result and lost the game.  Any comments would be appreciated.]

(;B[cn]C[Daniel: In retrospect, I think I've heard that approaches against 3-4 stones are more urgent than approaches against 4-4 stones.  So I probably should have responded in the upper left instead?

I can understand you feeling about a lokal response to c15, but ...

There is a proverb saying: there is no reason to let your opponent play 2 times against 4-4.
So I think c6 is playable anyway.

If you want to (sort of) punish w for not taking the last corner in simple way, just try e.g. c3 as answer, so you have the corner and w will not aproach there too early.]
;W[gc];B[fd]C[Daniel: My thought was to lean against the W stone and develop the left side.

D15 is the normal move, but your idea is understandable ...]
;W[fc]C[still d15 is the point];B[ed];W[jc]
(;B[dh]C[Daniel: I wasn't sure what to play here.  In retrospect, I think kicking at C16 first to take the corner and make W heavy would have been better?

I can understand d12.
C16 is questionable:
bC16 wD15; do you want to play bD16 to prevent the cut (very bad shape then)?]

no, but the move before is the troublemaker];W[io];B[hn];W[jm]
;B[hl];W[jk];B[nk]C[Daniel: Trying to make use of the aji in Q5 to reduce

no h10 is urgent, because moyo border for both, if you aregoing to answer h10 as you did, you can't play elsewhere the move before!]
;W[hj];B[gj]C[perhaps b can fight starting with j10 instead of g10 (which is a bit submissive)]
;W[gi];B[fj];W[hk];B[gk];W[il];B[op]C[Daniel: Since W didn't respond to O9, I thought I might be able to do some more damage than the gentle reduction I'd originally hoped for.  I end up living small in ko, while W firmed up a lot of territory, and I think I should have died.  Was the solution not to fight here, or did I miss something in the fight?

b is not in the position to fight anywhere around q5.

in this game b has allready a very difficult task to keep the balance.

wF11 would be very serious.

beside urgent F11 for both bP11 might keep balance, aiming h11 for cut and helps o9, which is allready in trouble]
;W[oq];B[nn]C[nice try to play light :-)];W[on]C[P7 is correct now, in the game the squeeze is very bitter.]

(;B[oo];W[no];B[pn];W[pm];B[om];W[np]C[the game is allmost lost by now

I would play still P11 hoping w wouldn't play F11 to early

advice for further games:
don't stick on half dead stones.
keep attension of borders of moyos!
check moves of your opponent to which you will answer without thinking. There might be a double sente between.

I hope the review will help you a bit.])
