C[ Hi! Thank you very much in advance for any advice and insight. ^_^

 This was played on KGS a few days ago, with me as white.  I'll do my best to remember what I had in mind with various moves.

pajaro: Hi! I'll try my best to comment this game. I'll start my comments with pajaro.]
;B[dc];W[pp];B[cp];W[qc]C[I like the 3,3 point!

pajaro: Fine. Play it. It is good to play a fuseki that makes you feel comfortable.]
;B[nq];W[pq]C[pajaro: Not good. You are trying to take territory with your star point. But 4-4 emphasizes influence, not territory. If B plays Q6 (now or later) your corner will look very cramped.]
;B[or]C[P2  seemed way too small.

pajaro: Agree. Better extend around L3, for example.];W[pm]
C[Extending up the side, keeping him from playing that area and attacking.  Seems fine to me, anyway.

pajaro: Yes, seems fine, but B had thn chance to play there before.]
;B[kp];W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[df];B[gc]C[pajaro: Joseki say that B should have played F17. W could cut later.]
;W[ci]C[I'm not familiar with jos
eki, so this may not be the normal way of things. ^_^

pajaro: too narrow. The proverb says "from two, extend three". Better at C10-D10]
;B[dj];W[cj];B[ck]C[I'm not sure about this.  C10 seems secure, and extending gives me a bit of territory, securing my group a bit.  perhpas a little small?

pajaro: C10 is safe. For B, C9 leaves a cutting point in D9. As there is a moyo in the bottom left, B shouldn't let W cut there. So C9 is not good.]
;W[dk]C[^_^  I had it in my head that I was going to be more agressive, and cut almost anything.  My thoughts were that there seems to be a ladder there, or I would be able to extend into the side a little more around B9.

pajaro: Good for cut here, but always think before cutting.]
;B[cl];W[dl]C[Hmm.  I suppose I wanted to press an attack on the two black stones, and also get some stones in the area.   I must have thought they'd be useful soon.

pajaro: Yes, they can be useful to reduce B's moyo.];B[cm];W[fp]
C[The two white stones don't seem to be doing very much to help the f4 stone...  It seems like it should be relatively safe.  ^_^

pajaro: Perhaps it's a matter of taste, but I think that I would capture D10 now. This would give you thickness . Invade/reduce later.]
;B[eq];W[fq]C[pajaro: You are in B's sphere of ingfluence. you must play lighter to avoid severe attacks. J3, for example.]
;B[hq]C[pajaro: Now B gets some secure territory and W lacks a base. Also, if D10 was captured, it would be easy for w to rescue his two stones. But...]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[hp]
(;B[ip]C[Is there any better way for black to deal with this?  I was thinking of a play at G3, but it doesn't seem to work out well for black as far as I can tell.

pajaro: See some variations. B doesn't seem to be in danger if plays G3. He will secure a lot of territory and keep on attacking W.]
;W[ho];B[io];W[gq];B[hr];W[hm]C[D8 and D9 are a little closer and have at least some effect on my group now.

pajaro: Yes, they have some effect. But once again, they are not safe. If B had extended to E10, the D8-D9 stones would be less useful for W.]
;B[oc]C[pajaro: Seems that B feels that he can't attack W anymore by now.]
;W[pe];B[lc];W[ph]C[white takes most of the side, black takes most of the top, seems fair.  White has the 4th line though  and both still have a chance to be invaded.  Black seems to be ahead, although the score estimator with this program says white is.  Hmm.

pajaro: Let's assume that no side is invaded, and that each side gets the minimum for them.
W: right side: 52, left side: 8. Total: 60
B: Upper side: 20, left side: 22, bottom side: 17. Total, 59.
Quite even. But black has sente, and W has a weak group. I think I'd rather be B now.]
;B[qj];W[qk]C[I with all the white stones around, perhaps a play like p10 would put more pressure on black, but since there's little hope of killing black off, safely trying to keep as much territory as I can seems best.

pajaro: The general rule is not to touch what you are attacking. I'd rather play S8, but I'm not sure.]
;B[pj];W[rh];B[pk];W[ql];B[oo]C[P5 seems to be trying to expand his territory at the bottom slightly, but perhaps K16 or K17 would be better, to prevent an invasion on the top.  Also, the black group at Q10 is seperated, and could soon be attacked.]
;W[po];B[on];W[ol];B[nj];W[mm]C[indirectly trying to press the attack on the Q10 group, but also wanting to push into the bottom group and reduce it.  Not a strong connection, but it should be able to escape to the left easily enough.

pajaro: The bottomgroup is safe. You can't attack it. And B should expect any territory around M5. So this W move is gote. B must defend.]
;B[jm]C[pajaro: Seems that B chooses to go out. Perhaps he will try to link up with O10, but W still has room to split B.]
;W[np]C[There I got being agressive again :)  From here I should be able to threaten P5 or O3!

pajaro: W goes for a small benefit, forgetting the important group: O10.]

(;B[op]C[pajaro: Perhaps N4 and sacrifice the two stones. Gain strngth in exchange.]
;W[mo]C[trying to link back up :)  If he cuts, I imagine I would attack.]
;B[mp];W[no];B[lp];W[oq]C[and I've earned a few points.  Mapped out some more territory with all those extensions too.  This helped me come back I bit I take it.]
;B[nm];W[nr]C[Attacking the bottom here was my mistake, I seem to lose much more than I gain.

pajaro: Yes. Better O10. Also keep pressure on B's weak group.]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[lr];W[os];B[mn];W[ln];B[nn];W[lm];B[lo];W[lk]
;B[nl];W[ok]C[I try to cut and attack the Q10 group now.  But it's hard after losing that other group, and now I have to sacrifice another group!

Pajaro: Beware. You have many weakness. If your attack fails, your opponent will strike back.]
;B[oj];W[nk];B[mk];W[mj];B[ml];W[lj]C[pajaro: These stones are small now. You have too many weaknesses that B can exploit. He can rescue his O10 group, or use it to attack your side. Imagine B R6.]

(;B[ll];W[ni];B[pn];W[qm];B[qn];W[rj]C[pajaro: More or less the same than in the var. B may lose 5 stones, but uses them to attack W.]
;B[rp];W[rq]C[I've killed the group, but sacrificed two, and got invaded..... Bad for White.]
;B[ro];W[qp];B[qo]C[pajaro: No. I know this is sente, but W will answer it will be so happy. This is worth very little, and you waste ko-threats. Also, it B forces W to capture P2, the endgame there will be better for W, as M1 becomes sente.]
;W[pr];B[rm];W[rl]C[pajaro: Again, sente for B, but B gets very little.]
;B[pl];W[om];B[sl];W[rk];B[ri];W[qi]C[pajaro: After this, W is stronger in that side. Please, thank it to B.]
;B[jd]C[almost lost that group, and didn't get to invade at the top.

pajaro: You must try to take the initiative some time.];W[nd]
C[pajaro: Good. Enlarges W, reduces B.];B[nc];W[od]TR[nf][mg]
[ng]C[trying to secure as much territory around O14 as possible, I don't seem to have done well.  ^_^  I'm still not entirely sure the best way of going about it.  At this point I think I need to make a strong attempt at controling the center but.... how?

pajaro: Not this way. Instead of P16, better N16. It is sente and bigger. B can't push through P16 very much.]
;B[md]C[pajaro: B takes the key point...];W[me];B[le];W[mf]
;B[lf]C[pajaro: ... and gains territory while limits W's.];W[hc]
;B[hd];W[gd];B[fd];W[ge];B[ic]C[F17, correct?

pajaro: I think B is better here. He captures H17 and secures the upper side.]
;W[hb];B[gb];W[ib];B[jb];W[he];B[id];W[fe];B[ed];W[dd];B[eb]
;W[bf]C[pajaro: No. W has a moyo in the center. He must try to take as much territory as possible. What about H10?]
;B[jk];W[jj]C[pajaro: Can you cut? No. So, try to press in the way that gives you the most. In this way, you are forcing B towards the left, towards your territory.]
;B[hk];W[il]
(;B[jl]C[pajaro: Letting your reducing stones to be cut? See var to see what happens if J9.]

(;W[oi]C[I don't think this was necessary, O13 seems to work out fine.

pajaro: Yes. But let me ask B something: Would have W resisted this attack if B hadn't helped him when the S7 forcing moves? W would have been weajer, indeed.]

;B[gi]C[Okay, here I start putting pressure on his group at H13.  I don't quite capture it, but it seems awfully close.  I'm not sure if there's a way, but perhaps there're better options for me.  also, a cut around J3 might be fun, and B9 is also a few points.]
;W[hi];B[hh];W[jg];B[jf];W[gg];B[gf];W[hf];B[jh]C[did'nt feel able to win a ko fight. If I could win it a few times, then I might be able to take a dent out of his group.  ^_^]

pajaro: nice dame ;) But again, B likes to play forcing moves that gives no benefit.]

;B[kr];W[ks];B[js];W[ms];B[jr]C[pajaro: No. Because of the F1 liberty, W can't capture. When W plays F1, B defends, but now, take sente.]
;W[pa];B[oa];W[qa];B[sk];W[pi]C[pajaro: Better T11. You will play it later anyway. With Q11, you lose a point.]
