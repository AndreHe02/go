Akoji: I would personally would play something like. Those two are the moves I am looking at. ]

;B[mo]C[Playing Tsuke at N6 would probably cause Hane at M6 giving white a strong position towards the center.

Akoji: I agree but N5 doesnt look that big either. I woudl still look at playing in those holes on the left side to reduce as much as you can.]

Akoji: Best time would have been early in the game, or as soon as you see that the left side is getting big. You can usually invade high if you see the space for it since its harder to capture that stone since it can always run out into the center. I hope this helped. ])

Akoji: I like Q12 you dont want to get surrounded and it works with the bottom shimari. No need to fear K4 because you can always split the side. I would be more worried about getting M17 pincered around that area.]
