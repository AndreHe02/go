C[theshuuji>> This is about my fifth game, so I'm not sure specifically what needs work.
theshuuji>> Pretty much anything would be useful at this point.

Hi, my name is David Adams, I'm 9 kyu on KGS.  I've been playing for a little less than a year.  I will do my best to give good advice.  Since you are a beginner, I will try to stay away from specific strategies and focus more on some basic ideas.  At this point, my best advice is that you play as many games as you can over the next few weeks and months.  Play relatively quickly, don't spend too much time analyzing every move.  You're going to make lots of mistakes, but that's how you learn.  And so if you make them quickly you will learn faster! :)  You will gain an intuition for what moves are better than others and what shapes are best as you gain experience.

Good luck... comments follow in relevant moves.

-dave];B[dq];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp]TR[dd][dp]C[This is an okay starting position for black, though when you are just starting out, I think it may be better to play on the 4-4 points, marked with the triangle.  Since 4-4 is symmetrical, there are fewer variations of corner play for you to worry about until you get more comfortable with that aspect.  But what you played is fine, too.]
;B[hq]TR[ce][co]C[This move took me off guard.  While I hesitate to say it is bad given my inexperience, I think the preferable move with a 3-4 opening is to play a corner enclosure instead, as marked with the triangles.  D3 along with C5 protects the corner nicely.]
;W[de];B[cd]TR[fc][fd][ce]C[This is probably an okay play, but I would prefer F16, F17, or C15 instead.  Here your two stones are very close together and are not working very efficiently.]
;W[ce];B[ed]TR[fc][gc]C[Up until now I could not say definitively that there had been any bad moves, but E16 here is a bad move.  You should extend out to G17 or at least F17 to claim some of the top as territory to counter the mini-wall white has built facing down the left side.  Now if white plays at G17 later on you have an ugly corner.]
;W[dj]C[White probably extended a little too far here.  D11 or C11 I would have picked.]
;B[dn]C[Given the plays up until now, this is not a bad play at all.  You might even could extend to D7 or C7, with an idea to play D12 or C12 later on to cut white in half, since he overextended down the side.]
;W[lq];B[fp]TR[ic][jc][nc][qf][qm][qn]C[Very bad move.  Your stones are pretty spread out in the lower left, but F4 clumps them up into a very inefficient shape.  You should be attacking white's huge realm of influence.  O17 or R14 are prime spots.  Also, J17/K17 looks great right now or R7/R6.  You should be looking to expand your influence while cutting down on white's.]
;W[qf];B[ld]TR[ic][jc][id][qn]C[This is the right idea!  Maybe a little far to the right given that white has an enclosure now with the addition of R14.  The marked points may be better.  R6 looks good too.]
;W[id]C[White took advantage of you playing too far to the right by splitting you in half.]
;B[ke]TR[jc][oc][gd]C[This is too slow and you are not pressured enough yet to try to run into the center.  You should be either pressing white on the right (G16) or establishing a base for your M16 stone as marked.]
;W[if];B[je]C[Too slow.  You need a base on the edge now!];W[ie]
;B[jd]C[This move does nothing.  There is no threat and you aren't really making territory or eyespace.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[ic];B[jf]TR[oc][kh]C[Again, not much here.  P17 or L12 are more appropriate...]
;W[ih];B[jg]C[Again, too slow.];W[pj]C[White takes advantage and builds a huge region of influence on the right!]
;B[ig]TR[oc][ck][pl][ql][pm][qm][pn][qn][nq][qq]C[Too early for this.  You need a base, or you need to invade!  Any of the marked moves are better.]
;W[hg];B[jq]TR[ck][cl][ql][qm][qn][nq][qq]C[This is pretty slow.  C9/C8 is preferable, but you need to invade the lower right, too.]
;W[nq]C[White makes it that much harder.];B[kr]TR[oc][ck][cl]
[ql][qm][qn]C[way too soon for this];W[lr];B[kp]C[This move doesnt' really do anything.  If you want to jump out to the center, J6/K6 is better.]
;W[lp];B[jp]C[This is a very bad move.  You are defending where there is no threat.]
;W[kq];B[jr];W[ln];B[jn];W[km];B[ko]TR[pl][ql][pm][qm][pn][qn]
C[Better would be to play K7, but now you are letting white build a wall around a huge area in the lower right.  You need to invade before it's too late.]
;W[lo];B[kl]C[This move is both too bold and not bold enough.  Invade deeply if you are going to invade.  But playing attachment moves like this when you are not connected to your other groups is really dangerous.]
;W[ll];B[jl];W[jm];B[il];W[im];B[hm];W[hl]C[See? you got cut off. plus white is burrowing into your territory.]
;B[hk];W[gl];B[in];W[el];B[em]TR[cl]C[wrong way.  you should be building territory underneath white's high position.  C8 is perfect.]
;W[dl];B[fm];W[fl];B[gm];W[bl];B[cm];W[ao]C[monkey jump hurts, but white played it too early.]

;B[ck];W[cj];B[cn];W[dk];B[hj]C[Thhis move does nothing... you should be trying to connect to the L15 group.]
;W[jh]C[Now white is trying to cut you off!];B[kh];W[hh];B[ji]
;W[kk];B[ik];W[kj];B[ii];W[ki];B[hi]C[Now you are cut off!]

[hs][is][js]C[Overall, you are doing very well for just having played five games!  19x19 go is very intimidating and difficult at first!  I hope my comments haven't seemed too harsh.  You are doing well.

You seem to have a good grasp on living groups.  I think your weakest point is how best to use your stones to make territory.  You got some good territory on the bottom, but your other groups got whittled down to just a couple of points because you never got around to extending along the third and second lines when you had the chance.  White got there first.  The key is to look for the big moves early on and worry about the little details later.  Of course, there are always times you have to attend to fighting right away, but try to avoid it and go for the bigger plays while you are learning.

I hope my review has been helpful.  I'd be glad to answer any questions you have about it.  Email me at dave@stuffeddog.com.  Thanks.]
