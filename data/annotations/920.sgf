C[yfh2 (W-17k*) vs mamor (B-15k*)  reviewed by shadow (6k*) for white
White wins on time (but was leading by 30)];B[pc];W[pp];B[cp]
;W[dc];B[fq]LB[cj:A][pe:B][ce:C]C[Possible moves for white to consider are
A is best
B is reasonable or something around there
C is slow and lets black control the game]
(;W[cf]LB[cj:A][jq:B]C[Rule of thumb for openings is
1) Corners first
2) Corner enclosures second
3) Extensions along the side third

Make an corner enclosure is as good as approaching your opponents corner in most cases.

If you can get a corner enclosure and a extension on both sides, then you are doing very very good.

Black can extend to "A", which means white will have to play "B" or Black is doing too good.  Allowing Black to get the extension to "A" lets black control the fuseki.

Better to play A and deny Black this point.  Then white and black both have 2 corners that need enclosing.  That's much better result for white than what could have happened.]
;B[qg]LB[qj:A][cj:B]C[Way too wide, if black wants to go wide he should play at A.  the correct direction is B though]
;W[qn]LB[oq:A][jc:B]C[The 4-4 stone needs two moves to make a proper enclosure and claim territory.  "A" is still needed.

Thus the proper thing to do now is side extensions.
White and black are both facing the top and that is prime area to put an extension stone.

"B" is the only move!];B[pj]LB[jc:A]C[A is the only move];W[jd]
C[Excellent];B[lq]LB[cj:A][kq:B]C[Wrong direction for Black.  Of the two extensions left  A give white a double wing extension for his top left stones and that's just too good!  Beside stones 3 and 5 face the left side and that works better for that corner enclosure.

White will have to extend to B to deny black a double wing extension.  But then the lower right corner is not a proper enclosure yet and white is behind.]
;W[dk]C[Excellent, Black has fallen behind];B[dm]C[1 line lower would be better.]
;W[jp]LB[ef:A][oq:B]C[No need for this White is leading.  Better to complete the moyo by playing A.  The top left would be practically impenatrable.  Or finish the enclosure in the lower right with B

Try to remember the proverb "Rich men don't look for fights"

White is winning, no need to complicate the game with a fight.]

(;B[oq]C[Good idea, get a base first. 1 space lower would work better though.]
;W[pq];B[np];W[kq];B[lo];W[qk]C[Strange move.  White was attacking blacks lower side and then abandons the fight.  White has 2 stones in a sea of black stones.  They have no base and black can chase them.

Black 9 is high and not doing a good job of claiming territory, nor is is providing much influence.

Furthermore white 20 touchs a stone which will make is stronger.   Rule of thumb: Don't touch the stones you are attacking.]
;B[qj]C[White force Black to become thick and claim territory.]
;W[ol]LB[ef:A]C[This does not attack the lower black group, nor does it attack anything else.  It does not do a great job of taking territory either.   A does a much better job of claiming territory, however whites group on the lower side needs help first.]
;B[iq]C[Uh oh, whites in trouble.];W[ip]
(;B[jq]C[Wrong move for black, white already doesn't have a base, no need for this, better to make sure black 23 gets to safely and leaves white vulnerable.

Do not concentrate on killing.   Uproot first, then make sure your stones are safe, if the opponent is still vulnerable chase it.

Better to make territory while chasing than killing.

1) Chase
2) make your stones safe and take territory
3) Chase some more

This is the safe way to make territory.];W[kr];B[hq];W[ko];B[lp]
;W[kp]
(;B[nn]LB[lm:A]C[Is this trying to make eye space?

Better to run away quickly with A and keep white's group eyeless]

;B[on];W[pn];B[lr];W[mg]TR[ll][lk][mk][nk]LB[kl:A]C[Good enclosing move.  It provides a way out for the marked white stone in case black cuts at A sometime in the future.  This is thinking big!]
;B[gg];W[gd]C[Good just take territory.];B[ii];W[ik]C[Protecting the cut and attacking the black stones.]
;B[gj];W[gk]C[Don't touch the stones you are attacking.  It only makes them stronger.

Better to let Black force you into his own territory and let him live with 2 points.  you will destroy as much simply by chasing.  No need to kill.]
;B[ej];W[dj]C[Right, take territory];B[fk];W[gl];B[fl]LB[dh:A]
C[Black got away.  Seal off the side by playing A];W[fm]C[Greedy,  White is trying to kill and trying to hard.]

LB[pe:A][mc:B][fo:C][ef:D]C[Nice recovery, white is safe everywhere.  Moves to think about are
Reducing black top right at A
Just take more territory at B
Reduce black some more on lower side with C
Claiima bigger corner with D in top left

I don't see how black can win at this point.];B[hn];W[go];B[gn]
