C[I'm gromit, Black and should have lost this game];B[qd];W[pq]
;B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[jc]C[a negative move];B[hc]C[its always a difficult question in these positions from which  side to pincer. I think this is the right one]
;W[mc]
(;B[oc]C[is q17 better?
no i think its the right move
it puts the most pressure to the white group];W[qi]
(;B[qg]C[no, this move is to narrow
take a look at the position now
black is restricted to the two corners while white has  already established a position in blacks sphere of influence
(even if this group is still attackable as shown in the var.)
white also has now the possibility to make another move to  enlarge his moyo at the bottom
i would have played something like the variation]
(;W[ql];B[cn];W[fp];B[dj];W[iq]
(;B[ie]C[I didn't know how to attack this group, is it too early?  direction?
this is no attack!
first you have to rob the group off its base!(as already  shown in the very first variation)
now white is able to build a base

I would try to reduce the white moyo
imagine a white move on the center star point
this would reduce blacks cornerframework and enlarge  whites moyo]
;W[em];B[dl]C[I think my answer is a little slow, as the corner is still open  I should have played somewhere else, but where? n15?
u are right  there is no need to play this move as the black stone has  still two directions to develop left ( the corner or the edge)
so i would play the reducing sequence i showed last move];W[fk]
C[this is bad i think as the moyo is too open for reducing and  black already has a lot of actual territory
so a move in the corner is better];B[oo]C[is this a standard move? i havent seen it before
as black has already a lot of territory he can reduce the  white moyo lightly with a keima or shoulder hit in the  middle of the lower edge
this move seems to be quite heavy];W[np];B[qo]C[ohps
you like "heavy metal" dont you ?
you must not always try to destroy all the opponents  framework
this to stones are just an aim to attack for white as they  havent any eyes]
;W[qp]C[good move];B[ol]
(;W[ro]C[no, this is bad as black has no base here anyway]
(;B[qn]C[too heavy];W[rn]C[this and the last two moves are all too slow
black has to try to escape fast and lightly from whites moyo
white has to try to attack the stones on a large scale];B[qm]
C[no comment];W[rm];B[pl];W[qk];B[oi];W[no]
(;B[fi]C[so far, I'm pretty happy with the result, is that a wrong  estimation?
no, u are right
black seems to lead in territory ( remind that the lower left  is not at all whites territory ) and whats more important  black has a weak white group at the top to aim at
(I even would have done this with the last move!)];W[oj];B[nj]
;W[pj];B[nk];W[ob]C[difficult move but i think it dont work here as black is strong  in the center]
;B[nb]C[should I only q18 and after o18 jump to m7?
i also would have played your move
i always give my opponents the possibility to show me  there preperated tesujis and here i think there is no one]
;W[nc];B[pb];W[od];B[pc];W[mb];B[oa];W[hb];B[ib]C[I'll give too much here :(
no its a good move
white has no base];W[ic];B[gb];W[hd]

C[my moyo has shrunk, white is strenghtened and I'm gote,  not good...
yes
the corner is the biggest now]
(;B[kk];W[bo]C[good]
(;B[bn]C[should I plunge in W moyo instead?
yes you have to try something there];W[ll];B[jl];W[lk];B[lj]

C[may be too slow but else I have to give up a bit of my big corner to save my stones, right?]
