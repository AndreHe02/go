[oe][qe]C[Rob- I don't think 8 is joseki.   o16  or p15 is best to emphasize the top,
while r15 is best for the corner.   r16 is just too slow];B[nd];W[nc]C[Rob- Now to avoid being shut in, you get pressed down]
;B[md]
(;W[cn]C[Rob - This is a good approach move, but I feel it is worth  sente to play variation 1..

After variation 1, despite b's thickness, the right side is open on top, and  so is not as imposing..]
;B[cl];W[en];B[ci];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[cq];W[jq];B[lq]C[Rob - The lower left is a  great outcome for you. Nicely played.]
;W[id]M[ed]L[ic]C[Rob- I might play j16  at j17, since that does a better job of connecting up to e16..It also  emphasizes territory more, which seems appropriate here.]
;B[cf];W[qg]M[md][nd][pe]C[Rob- It seems to me that the  main reason to play 24, instead of some safer move like r10, is to mount
an attack on the 3 baseless b stones  (q14 o16 etc)

That's a good strategy, but...];B[qi]C[Rob - Now b overextends..];W[qk]
C[Rob- and you invade. Nothing wrong with 26, but I think  that r15 was the strongest attack on the 3 weak b stones. r9 kinda splits  your forces. and seems a bit inconsistent with the (seeming) intent of 24..]
;B[qe];W[pj]M[qk]L[og]C[Rob - Now the strongest continuation would  be a one point jump to p13. r9 is not weak at this point, and after p13 it  would be tough for b to ignore the threat to his 4 weak stones.]
;B[ph]C[As it works out, it seems you kind of abandon a  potential attack, and don't gain much..]
;W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[qf];W[qj]L[nj][qm][mc]C[Rob 34 is just not good.It  is poor shape, and is very slow.   If I was to play in that area, I'd r7 or maybe o10

Otherwise, I'd be looking at n17..];B[nh]L[qm]C[Rob-  I think b could have hurt you more here. I think r7 or so would have left you  in a difficult spot, even considering the sequence with s11 etc..]

Rob- Ok, you live here, albeit a bit small];B[dc]
(;W[cc]C[Rob I feel d16 is a must here. Allowing b d16 gives him a world of cut aji.]
;B[dd];W[de];B[ec];W[fd];B[gb];W[fc];B[fb];W[db]L[cb]C[Rob c18 is just  as much of a threat, and is sente!]
;B[eb];W[cb];B[hc];W[ib]L[hd][ce]C[Rob - To me, 58 is far too aggressive, when  you have some major weaknesses, like at c15. If b cuts you at c15, you have  big trouble. If I was w, I'd h16 or just c15.]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[hd];W[ie];B[he];W[hb]L[ce]C[Rob - h18 is a waste of aji. You're just making b connect where  he wants to anyway, and he isn't short of liberties. Again, I'd probably just  c15 here.]
;B[gc];W[ge]C[Rob 66 doesn't seem to  do anything except stop the cut (for now) at e15, and threaten to hold b  in, temporarily.. Problem is, b can just push out at h14, or as before, cut  you at c15, which is devastating..]
;B[ce];W[ea]L[be]C[Rob -  e19 accomplishes very little, considering that now b16 comes very close to  killing your corner, and e15 threatens to capture d15 or f16 group..

I think you almost have to b15, so at least your corner doesn't die..];B
[ee];W[ef];B[df];W[kb]L[be][gf]C[Rob- 72 is not too good. it leaves b able to capture at f15,  seriously  threaten your corner with b16. Worst, it is protecting a cut point where b  can't cut..  I would either g14 or b15..]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[be]
(;W[fa]C[Rob- Unfortunately, the corner seems dead. Variation 1 is your  best shot, and it dies. f19 doesn't seem to help.]

 Terrapins 11k : Starting observation.

Rob - 80 might have been better at g14. b is sure to cut, and it is fatal for  this group to die on such a large scale..]

 guest45 NR : Starting observation.];W[fg]C[Rob - This sequence is not bad. If you can run out with 96  and f11, you diminish his territory somewhat. However, after the corner died,  you've got big territory problems.]
