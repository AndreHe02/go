C[Hi, thank you for reviewing my game!
I am playing black here. (11k on KGS)
I have tried to comment on my motivation for some of these moves. I hope they make some sense.

Hi, my name is Tim Kington.  I'm 1d AGA, and I'll be your reviewer today :)
Tip - don't use backslash characters in comments - it confuses some SGF readers.]

but I'm not good at fuseki.];W[pp]C[Kind screws me over for orthodox]
;B[dd]C[Is this OK?

This is completely fine.  Unless you're very strong, any move near the corner at this stage of the game makes no difference.]

Overall this doesnt look good for me.

Right.  One of the big problems in this game is that you keep worrying about one or two stones when they aren't important.]
;W[gp];B[fp];W[dn];B[co];W[do];B[gm];W[cp]C[Now the corner is in trouble...
Can black live here at all?

Well, White can take the corner if he wants it.  You're in bad shape here.
See variations.]

(;B[mq]TR[hm][ko][mp][in][io][jo]C[When you got into close fighting in this game, you cosistently left yourself with bad shape.  You need to be aware of that, and especially of cutting points.  Here you have three cutting points close together, and an empty triangle right next to them.  This will not end well.]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[np];B[mr];W[fs];B[pr]C[Seeing if I can't get the corner.

This probably isn't going to work.  You may be able to live in here, but it's not good for you - you'll get two points, and White gets a nice wall on the outside where it can affect the rest of the game.  Save this for later.]
;W[qq];B[oq];W[nq]C[White didn't answer your threat.  Were you bluffing?]

It doesn't really work.  You can't stop White from breaking through here.]
;B[cl];W[cn];B[dl]C[Gote];W[el]C[Seemed weird, asking for cut.

If you cut, you lose some stones.  You can lose the three on the left, the three to the right, or the five to the right.]

(;B[oh];W[ng];B[ph]C[gote

This way you have given yourself a weak group, and you don't really have hope of killing White's stones since he can capture in the corner.  How about blocking on the other side?]
;W[hm]C[I thought this might happen

Well, once it does you lose some stones.  This is enormous, because the two weak white stones to the left become connected to the living stones below.  The three stones you lose are important because they're keeping the groups separated.]

(;B[qc]C[Save R16 and corner. Surprised he didn't go there first.

This is worth some points, but isn't big enough right now.The crucial issue here is the weak black group on the right.]

Yeah, these are a little bit too small.];B[jk]C[Definitely too small - capturing those stones is just four points.  White should ignore this, and save the group above.]
