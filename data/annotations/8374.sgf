AB[dp][pd][pp]C[[J\]: Hi, my name is Jorik Mandemaker and I've reviewed this game as requested by Black..

I've marked my comments with a J. Be sure to set your SGF viewer to show variations so you won't miss the variations I have put in.]
;W[cd]C[mitchmk84 [6k\]: Hey gg];B[ed]C[Nibbler [9k\]: hi];W[ec]
;B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[cf];B[jd];W[dn];B[fp];W[dk];B[cn]LB[pj:A]
C[[J\]: This move is very big territorially and I think it is a good move. However personally I would prefer to play at A. All the black stones on the board are high stones geared towards influence. I feel a move like A is more consistent than the move played in the game.]
;W[cm];B[co];W[fm]LB[fr:A]C[[J\]: The black corner still has some weakness around A.]
;B[pj]C[[J\]: Good];W[kq]
(;B[nq]C[[J\]: This is from the wrong direction. You probably played here becaues this is the side of your moyo. However your group on the other side isn't that strong and ends up nearly surrounded in the game. See the variation.]
;W[hq];B[gq];W[hp]TR[fm]LB[eq:A]C[[J\]: After this move the white group is much harder to attack due to the presence of the marked white stone. Also your corner group is left with a weakness at A.]
;B[lp]LB[eg:C][nd:B][pf:A]C[[J\]: I like the thinking behind this move. But I don't think it's the best point to develop your moyo. More natural points would be (for example) A, B and C.]
;W[pm]
(;B[ql]TR[pm]C[[J\]: This move is your first serious mistake of the game.

The marked white stone is very weak so you should attack it. However you should generally attack from a distance. Touching moves and diagonal moves like you just played will only make white reinforce his stone.

See the variations for some suggestions on how to attack.];W[qm]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[qp];W[pl]TR[ql][qm][rl][rm]C[[J\]: Allthough you got the  corner it's clear that the marked exchanges are not in black's favour. They only serve to make white stronger.]
;B[qf];W[qk];B[qj];W[rk];B[rj];W[pb];B[oc]C[[J\]: Taking the outside is good here.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[rc]C[[J\]: A mistake by white. White should push at p18 and then hane at S16.]
;B[rd];W[sd]C[[J\]: A huge blunder by white. He has to push at P18 then live at S18.]
(;B[ra]C[[J\]: Always seal the oponent in before taking away the eyes. See the variation.]
;W[re];B[rf];W[ob]
(;B[nc]C[[J\]: You can still hane at O18, See the variation.]
;W[nb];B[mc];W[hd];B[hc];W[ic];B[id];W[gc];B[hb];W[gd];B[gb]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[kd]
(;B[jb]C[[J\]: This is too cowardly. See the variation.];W[lc]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[mb];W[ma];B[ld];W[la];B[na];W[oa];B[ka];W[na]
;B[pc];W[qa];B[rb];W[qb];B[ke]C[[J\]: The result is still not bad for Black at all.]
;W[gf];B[sc];W[sb];B[qe]LB[ef:A]C[[J\]: This move only threatens to capture a single stone. That's way to small. You give up the initiative here.

Instead jumping out at A looks good. Attacking the four white stones in the center while breaking into white's potential territory. 

By attacking in this way you'll probably get a good opportunity to make a lot of points on the right too.]
;W[ng]
(;B[ni]C[[J\]: White's last move is an overplay. As far as I can tell white can't escape after N12. See the variation.]
;W[lg];B[jg];W[mi]
(;B[mh]C[[J\]: This move helps your oponent more then yourself. N10 looks better.]
;W[nh];B[li];W[mj];B[lh];W[oi];B[nj];W[oj];B[nk];W[ok];B[mk]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[mg];B[pk];W[sl];B[lj];W[nl]TR[gc][gd][gf][hd]
[hp][hq][kq]LB[ef:A]C[[J\]: Your attack basically failed . White connected and most of your territory is gone. Still you are very thick now so you still have a chance. 

White has several weak groups left (marked) so if you jump to A now you may be able to start a fight where you can come back.]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[jm]
(;B[jk];W[hl]TR[hp][hq][kq]LB[ef:A]C[[J\]: After white got this move her bottom stones are quite safe. It's pretty much your last chance to play at A now.]
;B[hn];W[go];B[io];W[kp];B[ko];W[lq];B[mp];W[lo];B[kn];W[km]
;B[ln];W[hi]LB[ef:A]C[[J\]: Imagine if this move was at A instead.]
(;B[eg]C[[J\]: A little too far.];W[ef]
(;B[ff];W[fe];B[fg];W[ee];B[de];W[fb];B[gg];W[hf];B[hg];W[if]
;B[ig];W[kg];B[jf]LB[ch:A]C[[J\]: Unnecessary, your stones can conect to either the top or the botom. So they are safe for now. A looks like the best place to destroy White's territory.]
;W[kh];B[ne]LB[ch:A]C[[J\]: Very small, pretty much a pass. A still looks like the biggest area.]
;W[dg];B[dh];W[ch];B[di];W[ci];B[dj];W[cj]C[[J\]: White gets to take the entire left side. I think this is pretty much the point where White is assured of victory.]
;B[fi];W[fk];B[hj];W[gj];B[hk];W[gi];B[gk];W[gl];B[fj];W[ii]
;B[jj];W[ji];B[ki];W[jh];B[ek];W[fl];B[el];W[dl];B[em];W[en]
;B[gn];W[fn];B[fo]LB[gr:A][mr:B]C[[J\]: If you can't kill cutting doesn't gain you anything.
Instead you can play at A or B to take away the eyespace and threaten to cut. If white just connects you actually get some endgame benefit on the edge while white connects at this dame point.]
;W[mq];B[np];W[hr];B[gr];W[nr];B[or];W[ns];B[os];W[lr];B[jp]
;W[eq];B[dq]C[[J\]: A mistake. You should just connect at E4. White shouldn't be able to live.]
;W[er];B[dr];W[ep];B[eo]C[[J\]: The vital point in this situation is F1.]
(;W[do]
(;B[gp]C[[J\]: A mistake. F1 wins the capturing race without hurting the outside.]
;W[ho];B[im];W[fr];B[jq];W[jr];B[hs];W[is];B[bp]C[[J\]: There are no further comments as the result of the game has been decided already.

I hope you found this review helpful. If you have any questions feel free to send me an e-mail.

If you submit more games to the GTL in the future you should add a few questions in the SGF file. This way the reviewer can more directly adress what you were worried about in the game.]
