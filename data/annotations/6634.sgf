AB[dd][pd][dp][pp];W[qn];B[fa]C[playing on the edge of the board cannot help you secure territory - later in the game you will play on the edge to finish the boundries of your territory or connect groups, but not now]
;W[qk];B[ec]C[it's also a good idea to play far apart early in the game, to influence as much of the board as possible]
;W[nq];B[be]C[black is overconcentrated in the top-left and letting white have free reign bottom-right

remember that to win you must have at least one more point than your opponent]
;W[pq];B[qq]C[too little too late for black in this corner, I'm afraid]
;W[pr];B[oq];W[op];B[or];W[nr];B[ps];W[os];B[ao]C[again on the edge - not good]
;W[qs];B[qp];W[po];B[fr]C[the 2nd line isn't much better than the edge - F3 would be a much better move]
;W[qr];B[na];W[cq];B[oc]C[the C3 invastion MUST be answered!  - C4 is good - maybe you can kill the invasion?]
;W[dq];B[re]C[again black has abandoned a corner to white (bottom-left)]
;W[eq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[ep]C[now black has a nice wall - looking good!]
;W[fq];B[gq]C[if you were white, where would you play next?  F4, yes?  I think the black play here is F4 - or D10 to try to take the whole left side]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[gp];B[hp]C[F2, G3 and H4 have too many cutting points - they aren't doing black much good here]
;W[go];B[gn]C[danger - E5 is a cutting point and not that big a deal, ntil the F6 cutting point is created with this move - E6 would  have been a better move for black, so protect the cutting points - if white now plays D5, black is in atari and after that white can play C4 to capture the 3 stones]
;W[ho];B[io]C[a ladder is only a ladder if the white stones are in atari - black's shape just keeps getting worse plaing this way]
;W[hq]C[double atari];B[hn];W[ip];B[jp]C[again with the weak shape, with lots of cutting points]
;W[jq];B[ir];W[gr];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr];W[js];B[ks];W[iq];B[hr]
C[this move does black no good - white already has two eyes and thus cannot be killed, and black cannot make two eyes in there - K5 would be good for black - or E6]
;W[hs]C[white doesn't need to play in here either, incidently]
;B[fs];W[er];B[gs];W[is];B[hr];W[es];B[gs]C[black continues to play self-atari moves that do no good - white could simply ignore]
;W[fs];B[hc]C[an excellent move!

the weak shapes are still there, however, so white can shred black on teh bottom]
;W[jo]C[double atari];B[kd]C[again, an excellent move - in fact it's a big move - and there's a go proverb that says "Play urgent moves before big moves."  E6 is urgent

the group at L3 is already dead, so good to forget about it]
;W[kp];B[mc]C[black is very strong on top

which means it's not a good idea to play on top!

D10 would be bigger, when thinking about the whole board 

and I'm still worried about E6];W[in];B[im];W[jm];B[jl]C[see the shape black is creating again?   with the cutting points?]
;W[fn]C[there it is - I think white is better off with E5 instead, but that's just me]
;B[jn]C[self-atari];W[kn];B[km];W[jn];B[df]C[again, too close to black's strength]
;W[eo];B[ei]C[D5 seems natural, to try to keep those stones alive and build something along the left side - E11 is also claiming territory, but giving up what's already there]
;W[co];B[cl];W[do]C[this isn't needed from white - R12 better]
;B[am]C[again on the edge - bad news];W[fm];B[gi];W[hm]C[double atari]
;B[ih];W[il];B[jf];W[kl];B[mh];W[lm];B[pg];W[jk];B[kh];W[cm]
;B[cn];W[dn];B[bn];W[dm];B[bm];W[ap];B[al]C[edge plays to not enclose any territory]
;W[dl];B[dk]C[again wtih the cutting point - play D9 instead]
;W[ck];B[bl];W[bk];B[aj];W[ak];B[cj];W[an];B[bj];W[dj];B[di]
;W[ek];B[ej];W[dk];B[ci]C[excellent!  this is the first move of the game where black has protected a cutting point]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[cd];B[cb];W[bd];B[ad];W[ce];B[cf]C[see all the cutting points?]
;W[bf];B[ae];W[af];B[ac];W[bb];B[dc];W[ab];B[bg];W[db];B[ca]
;W[da];B[ea];W[ba];B[eb];W[de];B[ee];W[gj];B[eg];W[fj];B[fi]
;W[hi];B[hh];W[ii];B[hj];W[ij];B[hk];W[gk];B[fk];W[hl]C[a white mistake - F8]
;B[gl];W[gm];B[ik];W[jj];B[ji];W[fl];B[kk];W[gk];B[lj];W[gj]
C[why give up your stones?];B[li];W[kj];B[fj];W[lk];B[mk];W[ml]
;B[nl]C[you're seeing the cutting points now?];W[nk];B[mm];W[mj]
;B[nj];W[nm];B[ni];W[ol];B[nn];W[mn];B[mo]C[black's moves are futile inside white's stronghold]
;W[no];B[np];W[mp];B[lp];W[lo];B[lq];W[mq];B[mr];W[ms];B[ls]
;W[lr];B[oo];W[on];B[ro];W[qo];B[rn];W[rm];B[qm];W[pm];B[rl]

;W[sg];B[sf];W[sh];B[ri]C[self-atari];W[si];B[jg]C[L11 better]
;W[ki];B[jh];W[ag];B[ah]C[cutting points again];W[bh];B[ch]
;W[ai];B[bi];W[ah];B[cg];W[qc];B[rf]C[in this case, black is protecting where there is no cutting point - do you see what I mean?  

defend the corner! - R16 is the move];W[qd];B[qe];W[pc];B[pb]
;W[qb];B[qa];W[ra];B[rb]C[Q19];W[pa];B[oa];W[ob];B[nb];W[pb]

;W[nf];B[ng];W[og];B[oh];W[nh];B[ke];W[oe];B[ng];W[pd];B[nh]
;W[mk];B[mi];W[sc];B[le]C[ not needed];W[rp]C[not needed];B[sp]
;W[rq];B[rr]C[futile];W[so];B[sq];W[sr];B[ss];W[rs];B[lc]C[not needed

Overall, black played lots of strong moves, on big points.  The idea of playing away from the action is an excellent skill to develop, playing those big points.  And, must play urgent points first.

The reason black was shredded is because of all the cutting points.  Email me back if you have any more specific questions, or want to know where I would play as black on a particular move.]
