C[Hi tom,

You played pretty decently this game but your main problem was missing a lot of the vital points.  Don't think so much, just get used to finding the right idea for a situation.  Use your instincts.

Also, when your opponent makes a mistake be very careful not to let them fix it.]

[kq:b]C[This move is perfectly normal, it aims to keep Black on the right side and not expand his moyo.  Just make a shimari, it's the easiest.]

(;B[np]LB[pl:A]C[I don't agree with this move because you are making him stronger while it is not clear that your right side will be big.  R9 is low so you can be reduced with A.]

;B[jd]C[Well you have to play something like k16 to make your stones have any use, but you are a bit overconcentrated, which is why you should not have let white p10, he wouldn't have had time to just invade the corner.]

(;B[ih]LB[if:B][jf:C][jg:D][kh:A]C[Small plus bad shape.  If White gets a stone at A he has the B-D sequence so it's bad aji.]

This is possible I suppose but the kosumi in this situation is strange.  Easier to just jump.]

No, this is the right direction, the bottom is worth points.]
