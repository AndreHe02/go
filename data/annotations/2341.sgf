RE[B+28.5]

C[Hi, I will be reviewing your game.  My comments are those of a rank amatuer, but I hope they will help you see some of your blind spots in your play.  Certainly a stronger player would have more to say and may even discredit my suggestions.  I can only hope that my comments will aid you in seeing other moves and open your mind to other possibilities to try.    I will precede my comments with DS:

To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for the review.  To be honest, I don't have any idea where I could possibly be going wrong.  It seems as though no matter what I try, I keep falling behind early in the game and having to try desperately to catch up.  Indeed, I think I've lost a full stone in my ranking in the past few months.

This game is no exception; after Black played at K2, I had the sinking feeling that there might already be no way for me to salvage the game.

I've had stronger players tell me I need to attack more -- and when I do, I immediately get counter-attacked and end up with weak groups all over the board.  So if I play to try to keep from getting a bunch of weak groups, I get criticized for being too passive and letting my opponent get to much territory.  And if I try to build a moyo to get more territory than my opponent, my opponent is able to invade with no problem.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger, Fedya on KGS];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[ce]

(;W[gc]C[Ted:  Would it have been better to play a pincer attack at, say, C13 here?  Stronger players have told me on the one hand that such a stone would be a good extension from D4, while others have said that a pincer attack like C13 works better if there's already a white stone in the K16 area.

At any rate, I decided against it because I usually end up with the worse position in a pincer attack, and decided to make territory instead.

DS:  Try to find moves that serve more than one purpose.  The reason a pincer is better here is that it is both an extension from the D4 stone, but also a pincer for B's C15 stone.  Possible plays include C13 D12.  A move at D2 would also be a strong move as it allows W to follow-up with moves at either D14 or extend to K16.  See variations....]
;B[ch]
(;W[qj]C[Ted: I thought for quite some time about this move, and am still not certain what I should have played.  I thought about approaching the Q16 stone at O17, or approaching in the other corner with R5.  In any case, I didn't want Black getting a third move in on the right side before I did, as this would make it much more difficult for me to attack.


DS:  This is a slack move.  The biggest move now is at R5 or Q5.  Don't let your opponent make a corner enclosure if possible.]
;B[qn]C[DS:  This acts as a weak pincer and a corner enclosure.  Also W can only extend upward now.]
;W[qg]C[DS:  Too far from Q16 to really have any effect.  So far all of W's moves have been single purpose. ie defensive or territory oriented.]
;B[md]
(;W[jp]C[Ted: Would this have been better at K3 instead?  As the actual game went, it would have been much better for me to have a stone on K3 instead of K4.

DS: another slack move.  Although this is a big point, and I agree that K3 might be better than K4 as Q3 is low, I think a move at S16 would be best.  It attacks the RU Corner and is an extension from W's R side group.]
;B[mq]C[DS:  For B here, I think I would have played C6 instead.  This seems too cramped for B at this point.]
;W[gp]C[Ted: I think I should have played at either C3 or K3 here, but I was worried about Black trying to split me by playing around G4 himself.

DS:  Really bad move.  W is open at the bottom, the corner is still wide open and G4 is much too uni-purpose - DEFENSE.  I would much prefer to see W play C7 or at the top R corner instead.  Even invading at R17 might be ok, then any way B responds is bad as W's R13 group would erase any thickness B could make.]
;B[cq]C[DS: Big move, good timing.];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[cr]

(;W[dr]C[DS:  Bad.  Since W is open at the bottom on the right, there is now no good way for W to make territory at the bottom.  How about B5?  Perhaps then W can extend upwards and pincer B's C12 group?]
;B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[jr]C[Ted: Now I'm in big trouble.  I've been forced to make the exchange of giving up territory and getting thickness in return, which for me has always been a losing proposition.  I can't remember even one game where having thickness has been good for me.

Stronger players keep telling me that you can use thickness to make territory in another part of the board by attacking a weak group, but I could sit at the board all day trying to figure out how to do this, and not seeing anything.  I don't see any weak groups to attack, and I don't see how having the thickness in the lower corner could ever possibly get me territory in the center or at the top or anywhere else on the board.


DS: Go is also about efficiency.  Moves that do more than one thing are more efficient.  The reason your thicknesses are wasted may be that you always seem one move behind.  Like here.  However, If K4 was at K3 it would have been better.  One should learn to create walls and thickness.  These create Influence that will be valuable in either creating a moyo, or driving a weak group toward it and attacking.]

(;W[jc]C[Ted: This is one of the moves I spent the most time thinking about.  I couldn't find any moves to defend against the K2 stone.  If I play H2 or J2, Black can respond at J3, and both of those look like trouble for White.

So, I finally decided that the least bad thing to do right now would be to take some more territory, and figure out later what to do at the bottom.

DS:  OK, Now this is better, but L17 would be ok and maybe put more pressure on B's corner.  However, I think I would have invaded at R17 first.]
;B[re]C[DS:  B now protects the corner and attacks W's side group.]
;W[mb]C[Ted: I figured that K2 worked for Black, so I'd try the similar move myself.

DS:  B strong here, so this attack fails.  W has fallen behind already.  B has three corners to W's one and W has little prospect to make territory elsewhere.]
;B[nc];W[nb];B[ob];W[lc]C[DS: much too defensive given that W is so far behind already.]
;B[ld]
(;W[kc]C[DS:  ditto. At least L16 would be better shape and give W a chance to build territory at the top.]
;B[pg]C[DS:  B starts to build territory by attacking W's group.]

(;W[rg]C[Ted: I have a feeling this isn't the best move.  But I wanted to make certain I'd be able to get eyes on the edge of the board.  I was worried about Black responding with R12, but fortunately, he didn't.

DS:  I think W's only move is Q12]
(;B[pf];W[ph];B[oh]C[DS:];W[pi];B[oi];W[oj];B[kd];W[kh]TR[kd]
[ld][md][oh][oi][pf][pg]C[Ted: I took quite some time thinking about this move too.  I figured I had sente, but didn't know what to do with it.  I felt that Black had two walls, and so was halfway to making a nice big chunk of territory, so I'd better stop him.  This is what my opponents usually do to me when I get two walls like this, and it works quite well for them.

DS:  B is way ahead in territory.  This move again is only single purpose.  Reduction.  Perhaps a move at K16 would at least help to expand W's top territory while limitng B's.    As B is ahead, I would consider attacking W with a move at J12.  See variation for one possible line...]

(;B[lg]C[DS: Defensive.];W[kj]
(;B[dk]C[DS: Bad move.  C9 only.];W[eo]C[Ted: I had been quite worried about Black cutting at D5 for quite some time, and Black's play at D9 only increased that worry.  I figured I'd better do something to make that cut impossible.

DS: It is impossible for B to cut at D5.  See variation.  This is another wasted move.]
;B[gk]C[DS:  Slack move.  Many other moves are bigger.  Like B17 or J3]
;W[kl]C[Ted: Once again, I didn't have any idea what to do.  Should I be trying to connect to the group on the bottom, or the group on the side?

DS:  W's group is starting to look weak and could be surrounded.  I agree with this move, But an extension at O9 might work too.  However, L8 really isn't bad.]
;B[nm];W[kn]C[DS:  Now I think a move at O10 would have worked better.]
;B[mo]C[DS:  B must feel satisfied that he is ahead and a simple defensive move like this is ok.  But B17 or J3 are still bigger.]
;W[rm]C[DS:  Again Left upper corner or J3 would be better than a move like this.]
;B[rn];W[sn];B[qm];W[rl];B[so];W[sm];B[ro];W[ql];B[pl];W[pk]
;B[ol]C[DS:  B just closing up territory.];W[nj];B[fe]C[DS:  A little slack.  B17 better, or F16 etc better.]
;W[hh]C[Ted: I was extremely worried about Black responding to his last move with F17, which I think would make matters difficult for me at the top of the board; Black might well split the two groups successfully.  I played this because I felt trying to stop Black from getting a whole bunch of territory on the left side into the center (quite likely if I simply played F17 myself and Black responded here) would be a threat Black would have to respond to.

DS: W should have played D13 earlier and then this would not have been an issue.  Still I don't see much to worry about with B at F17.  W would just hane at F18.]
;B[fh];W[ii]C[DS:  Too timid.  W is way behind and must attempt something.  At least B17.  This is huge for either side.]
;B[gi];W[fd];B[ee]C[DS: just helps B solidify his territory. Bad move]
;W[ed];B[bc]C[DS:  B gets big point.];W[cb];B[cd];W[bl]C[DS:  Too timid.  At least W can jump to B9.]
;B[bj];W[ge];B[ff]
(;W[hr]C[DS:  I think W at J3 would be better.];B[kq]C[Ted: I was extremely thankful that Black didn't play at J3.

DS:  Perhaps B knew he was so far ahead he didn't need to create complications or a fight.    Anyway, B at J3 would be of little value.  Even if cut off W's L6 group would be able to link up at the top or right side without problem.]
;W[iq];B[hm]C[DS:  I think W at G7 may have been a better move.]
;W[jd];B[jf];W[nh]C[Ted: I took a long time to come up with this move, and figured it would help reduce Black.  If Black tries to cut at O11, White can still connect because the response at N11 would be an atari.

DS: Yes, but of little value.];B[ng];W[ni];B[og];W[je];B[ke]
;W[if];B[jg];W[ig];B[kg];W[jh];B[ds];W[es];B[cs];W[er];B[bp]
;W[mc]C[Ted: I didn't know what to do here.  I felt that at least this would force Black to respond and cost him a point or two.  The game isn't lost already, is it?

DS:  Yes it is.  Sorry.];B[nd];W[oa];B[pb];W[bb];B[ac];W[pa]
;B[qa];W[na];B[qb];W[lp]C[Ted: I counted the score and figured I was behind by something like 15 points, so I had to do more to try to reduce Black.  I don't know how this helps, but I was frankly desperate for ideas.

DS:  You need practice with counting.    B has:
         RL Corner:  40 points
         RU Corner  24 points
         LL Corner  8 points           L Side   26 points.
---------------------------------         B Total - 98 points  (Approx)

W has:
        R side  13 points
        L bottom 20 points
        L Top  28 points
        center 4 points         komi  6.5
------------------------
      W total  - 71.5 (approx)

DS:  At this point unless B makes a huge blunder, he will win and there is nothing W can do about it.]
;B[lq];W[mp];B[np];W[lo];B[mn];W[ln];B[mk];W[mj];B[lh];W[li]
;B[ck];W[gn]C[Ted: I hoped this would get me a few more points of territory.

DS:  yes, but too little too late.

The rest is all endgame and nothing will change the outcome.]

;B[hi];W[lm];B[mm];W[ok];B[dl];C[Ted: I was stunned to find that I had actually lost by 28.5 points.  I had figured I was only behind by about half that much.

DS:  You need work on finding moves that are multipurpose.  You did little or no attacking during the game, and yes you are correct that always attacking and fighting is not the best either.  I would suggest the following:

1) study tesuji and simple life and death problems. Do all the easiest ones until you can do them on sight with little or no reading.    2) Books I recommend:    Lessons in the Fundamentals in Go by Toshiro Kageyama

The ABC's of Attack and Defense by Michael Redmond.   Graded Go problems for Beginners Vols 1-4.    Start with volume 1 even if it seems beneath you.    3) Learn to count or at least estimate the score quickly.  Count territory by 2's (pairs) after taking into account prisoners and captured stones.    4) Watch stronger players games and try and count the score near the end before the game ends and see how close you are.  This will give you practice counting while not worrying about the next move.    I hope these comments help some and you can become stronger.    Good luck
