C[$ Hi, I'm Sylvain (Black on this game). Please comment for both side.

&Hello I'm Stephane (white in the game)

D: Hello Stephane and Sylvain :) My name is Darek (1k) and I tried to made review of your game... I have to say that you a both played strong and nicely balanced game.

M: Hey guys, I´m Moritz (1k). I´ll try to comment too. Enjoy.]

& this look very far from the other white group no ? B can invade very easily. Perhaps M3 is better ?

;W[fc];B[bd];W[nc]C[D: Nice idea :)]
(;B[lc]C[& at last b pincered :)

D: and OK, Q14 would be too permissive.]
(;W[jc]LB[pf:B]C[D: Difficult choice... After black N16 or M15 there is problem when white would jump at san-san.
I my opinion the best move in this situation is at point Q14 or other one at O16.]

(;B[le]
(;W[lb]C[&this move is good ?

& me I like B :)

D: I prefer  this move]
(;W[kq]C[& this is good ?
& my idear was to get strong here so I coud invade aroud Q6 (or play N14 if b defend the corner.
& is it good strategy ?

D: it's OK, although I would prefer doble kakari at Q6. But I think it's just a question of style.
M: Playing double kakari leaves too big options in the bottom white side. Black cannot seal the corner with one move, so there is no need to make the game conplicated at this point because white can still reduce at O10 for example and L3 makes F4 look good.]
;B[mf];W[md]C[D: Slow and not neccesery, this ko isn't really dangerous. Moreover the white shape is not too beautiful after this connection:) Better to play Q6/R6 or Q17 insted. After Q17 there is cutting point at Q15.]
;B[ng];W[qn]C[D: I would prefer higher at Q6
