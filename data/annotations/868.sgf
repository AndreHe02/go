C[General comments
-----------------------------

Black took better points in the opening and early middle game, e.g. White
played three moves on the right early on, and also the slow move on the
bottom edge. White caught up by playing better in the fights and twice
managed to cut off Black stones to make decent territory: once on the right
and later on the left. The real difference, though, was in the endgame.

At the start of the endgame, the game was fairly close, but White managed to
pull out a fifteen point lead. Black answered too many of White's moves
instead of taking big points of his own, so White got the majority of the
big endgame points.];B[qd]C[
gedh 9k*: here we go!];W[ec]C[
kossa 6k*: have a nice game! (2)
gedh 9k*: oh cut that out; please only play on 4-4, or 3-4 :)]

;B[ck];W[ch]LB[ci:a]C[Extending a point further, to 'a', would put more pressure on the
Black group.];B[qn];W[qf]LB[qh:a][qg:b]C[This leaves an unpleasant invasion at 'a' - I'd prefer to play a
two-space extension to 'b'.];B[kq]LB[hq:a]C[Good choice, leaving a further good extension at 'a'.]
;W[oj]C[
gedh 9k*: oops, just checked your info & seen the even-game comment!
------------------
This shows the effect of the over-extension: White feels compelled to add
another stone to strengthen his group.];B[cd];W[de];B[dd];W[ed]
;B[ce];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[db];W[ld]C[

kossa 6k*: great :) (30)
gedh 9k*: oh; that looks very healthy now
-------------------
Black still looks OK here, with territory in three corners. White has a big
moyo, but there are plenty of ways to reduce it.];B[jj]C[
gedh 9k*: Just got my ruler out and drew a line from D12 to P10!

A point further in looks quite safe.];W[iq]LB[ko:a][jh:b]C[This looks small, considering that the White group on the bottom
edge is quite strong. Black should be happy to answer at 'a', or to walk in
to the White moyo with 'b'.];B[jo]LB[ko:a]C['a' looks like better shape. The knight's move is usually used to
attack, and the White group isn't attackable.];W[mp]C[
kossa 6k*: I make a lot of experimental moves :) (34)];B[mn]
C[
gedh 9k*: me too, but I don't know which ones!];W[on]C[Clever, offering to sacrifice the N4 stone in return for wrecking
the corner.];B[no]LB[po:a]C[The other option is to hang on to the corner with 'a'. It's not at
all clear to me which is better.];W[oo];B[np];W[op];B[oq];W[qo]
;B[qp]C[Good - at least Black gets to keep a decent amount of corner
territory this way.];W[ro];B[rp];W[po]C[At this stage, I estimate:

Black
  top left  14 points
  top right 10 points
  bottom left 5 points
  bottom right 20 points
  total 49 points

White
  bottom  9 points
  right  20 points

... so White needs about 20 points from his moyo at the top.]
;B[gb];W[eb];B[jc];W[mc];B[je];W[lf];B[fe];W[ee];B[pf]LB[jg:a]
C[Getting the stones at the top out of trouble, by playing 'a', should
be the first priority. If White ignores the contact move and plays 'a', the
Black group will have to scramble for eyes. If Black ignores White 'a' and
follows up the contact move, the Black group might die.];W[pg]
;B[of];W[og];B[qe];W[rf];B[ng];W[nf];B[ne];W[mf];B[nh];W[lh]
C[The White group is getting stronger and the Black stones at the top
are looking weaker. Black is trying to handle two weak groups at once, which
is always tricky.];B[qg];W[qh];B[ph];W[rg];B[oh];W[qg];B[mi]

(;W[jd]LB[id:a]C[
gedh 9k*: I'll try it

Playing the solid connection at 'a' is a bit more effective - go back to see
some variations.];B[id];W[ie];B[hf];W[id];B[ib];W[kd];B[kb]
C[A nice sequence by Black.];W[cm]
(;B[dm]LB[dl:a][dj:b]C[This is usually a sensible answer, but here it looks like Black can
play the more agressive move at 'a', helped by the fact that 'b' threatens
to cut off and kill a large White group. Go back to see a variation.]

(;W[dl]LB[cl:a]C[This shouldn't work - the more normal move at 'a' is better. Go back
to see how that works out.]

variations.];W[cl];B[em];W[dj]C[
gedh 9k*: shit; I can't find anywhere interesting to play.......
kossa 6k*: hmmm...I would say everywhere :) (124)
gedh 9k*: we're obviously in different mind states here!
kossa 6k*: yes...that is obvious since you are ahead :) (124)

My estimate now:

Black
  top left  10
  top right 10
  bottom left 5
  bottom right 20
  top 5
  total 50

White
  left  12
  right 26
  bottom 9
  total 47

Close, despite the fact that White made next to nothing out of his moyo. He
did, however, get to seal off the right side territory during the fight and
then stole about 10 points of territory  on the left.];B[gj]
;W[pi]C[Nice timing.];B[ni];W[fj];B[hp];W[hq];B[gp];W[gq];B[gl]
C[A nice sequence by Black, but it's going to be difficult to keep
much territory in the centre in the fact of White's wall.];W[kj]

Black:

White
  left 15

White does have sente, so the game is still close at this point.]
;W[jr]LB[kr:a]C[White could play 'a' in sente.];B[kr];W[sp]
;B[rq]LB[sq:a]C[It looks like Black can play 'a' safely.];W[sq]
;B[sr];W[so];B[ah];W[ai];B[ag]C[Good endgame play by Black - connecting in the bottom right is worth
about six points, so he can get some sente plays of his own in first.]
;W[bi];B[bn];W[sc];B[rc];W[sd];B[se]LB[sb:a][re:b][rd:c][rb:d]
C[Better to just play 'a', followed by White 'b', Black 'c', White
connects, Black 'd'.];W[re];B[sb];W[rd];B[qb];W[cb];B[bb];W[nb]
C[
gedh 9k*: you are an endgame monster!];B[ob]LB[rr:a][cc:b][ak:c]
C[Answering O18 isn't all that big - may be three or four points.
Connecting at 'a' is about six or seven, capturing at 'b' is about eight and
the monkey jump to 'c' would be about ten (though gote).];W[br]
C[
gedh 9k*: :*(];B[bq]C[
 kossa 6k*: I hope so :) (173)

Again, this block is not the biggest move around - it's about five points.
White is stealing all the big endgame points.];W[bm]C[
 kossa 6k*: My ISP disconnect after 3 hours...that's why I got
dosconnected :( (174)];B[da];W[dc];B[cc];W[ea];B[jq]LB[ca:a]
C[Capturing at 'a' is worth ten points. Black's move at K3 is probably
about 5 in reverse sente (i.e. it would be sente for White). Reverse sente
moves are worth double (roughly speaking), so these moves are similar
sizes.];W[ip];B[io];W[ca];B[nc];W[lb];B[ha]C[Not necessary - Black has an eye at G14.]
;W[ba];B[ab];W[ir];B[nm];W[om];B[am]LB[rr:a];W[al];B[an];W[el]
LB[rr:a][bo:b]C[This doesn't threaten to cut (see variation), so Black can answer
at 'a'. Even if the Black group gets cut off, Black can live with 'b'.]

;B[qr];W[ss]C[White gets the last big yose. At this point I estimate:

Black:

White
  left 18

White has gained something like 15 points during the endgame.]
