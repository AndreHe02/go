C[dmg: Hello, I am Damien. I will put all my comment with 'dmg:'  before. Thanks for reviewing my game. I know where I made a big mistake that was a reading error. I'll translate what we have said during the post-game discussion (which is in French). I especially want comment on the direction of play and how to have a faster development.

goall: merci beaucoup
dmg [13k?\]: bonne partie
goall: bonne partie

Hi Damien! I hope you like my review. If something is unclear or you would like to discuss something, just come to KGS and look if I'm online or send e-mail. After reviewing your game, I thought that there are few things I would like to emphasize:

1. Try not to be shut in. Even if you have a lot of territory, your opponent can get thickness. Instead of taking a few points on the side, jump into the center. These jumps can serve as safe points from which to launch an attack

2. Remember to count the value of different possibilities. You made few mistakes in the game where you lost about 20 points. That makes a big difference (moves 51, 71(this wasn't that bad because your opponent responded), 87 ,111) For example, capturing a stone may look big but when you take a closer look at it, it's actually quite small

3. Try to be more aggressive. Take the initiative. You were mainly just responding to your opponents moves. If your opponent plays a small move, ignore it and attack him or do whatever you want to do

Your questions of faster development and direction of play are quite difficult and I'm sorry I can't answer them very thoroughtly. I'm no expert. Still, I hope you enjoy my review.

-Khobzter];B[pd];W[dd];B[dq]C[goall: ah];W[pp];B[co]C[dmg: I've tried a crossed fuseki which is rare for me.

goall: c'est bien ça
dmg [13k?\]: j'ai tente un croise mais j'ai laisse blanc faire le centre]
;W[pj]LB[jp:A][jq:B]C[Extending to A or B is better because that is the corner enclosures direction of play]
;B[jp]C[Good move. According to a proverb, "Your opponent's good move is your good move". After this black should try to play on the left side, thus forming a double wing formation.]
;W[qf];B[nd]
(;W[rd]LB[qc:A]C[This was unnecessary, playing here makes white unable to invade the corner later at A (see variation).]
;B[qc];W[lc]LB[mc:B][id:A]C[dmg: I did not knew how to handle this stone so I've decided to settle my groups and get sente. Maybe I should have tried to make the life hard for the m17 stone?

I think you sjould have attacked the stone for example at A (see variation). Still, I think  B is ok too because it defends o16 group and makes white heavy at the same time, but it mainly leaves whites daring play unpunished]

(;B[mc];W[ld]C[dmg [13k?\]: j'aurais du etre plus severe mais je voulais recupere le sente]

(;B[cf]CR[fc][gc][hc][ic][jc][fd][gd][hd][id][jd]C[Attacking the m16 group is a better option, because it is heavy and vulnerable. You should consider the circle marked moves (see variations). But c14 is by no means bad, because it works well with the lower group.]
;W[ch];B[fc]C[dmg: Bad choice ? Get in the corner directly ?

goall: tu me diras mon niveau à la fin?

No I think this was a good choice.];W[df]C[dmg [13k?\]: j'essaierai en tout cas t'es au dessus de 20k :)]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd]C[goall: comment tu le sais?
dmg [13k?\]: ca se voit a ton fuseki];W[hc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb]
;W[ec]C[goall: ok]
(;B[bg]LB[dg:A]C[dmg: bad ? better option to settle the group ?

This move is kind of useless because the group is already alive. It's a move you would play if the group was threatened. Playing for example at A would lead to better results because it is aggressive (see variation)]
;W[cg];B[ce];W[bh];B[af];W[de];B[ck]LB[dk:C][cl:A][nq:B]C[dmg: second extension of the corner, extension of the 3 c12 stones = better option, Am I wrong ?

I think this is ok, but when you are playing this near to your opponent, you must be prepared to sacrifice the stone. A would be a little bit too small. I would not play either of these, I think B is better. C is also an idea worth considering, because the center is getting big and therefore it would be wise to try to gain influence. Also makes the black's formation safer and harder to invade.]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[dk]C[This is only helping you, a bad choice from white]
;B[dm];W[dj];B[jn]LB[em:A]C[dmg: trying to make a good moyo

Good move. A would be good too, but maybe slightly overconcentrated. It would reduce white's center moyo]
;W[em]
(;B[dn]C[dmg: Is hane possible ?

No, see variation];W[gm]
(;B[go]LB[jl:A]C[A would have been better. White's moyo in the center is huge and should be immediately reduced. A is the key point (see variations)]

(;W[io]LB[jl:A]C[goall: et c'était égalité

Should have been at A (see variations)]
(;B[ip]LB[in:A]C[dmg: Should I've gone to k6 instead ?

goall: mais si je n'avais pas eu de la chance, ça n'aurait pas marché

I think A would have been better. You have a strong position, and you should use this strength to attack, maybe even kill white. That way you would also gain thickness to counter whites moyo in the middle (see variations)]
;W[ho];B[hp];W[gn];B[fo]C[goall: tu as trop défendu];W[en]
C[dmg [13k?\]: oue
dmg [13k?\]: ouep];B[eo]LB[jl:A]C[Bad. Whites move number 50 should be ignored because it's small. At worst you could lose only a few points in the corner. You should consider playing at A]
;W[im]C[goall: tu aurais du attaquer
goall: K5
goall: oui];B[jo]LB[kl:B][jm:A]C[dmg: I feel like this stones is a wasted move but i didn't knew where to play

B, for example would have been better. Your move is too slow, now if white plays A or B, his moyo becomes huge (even though it already is, it should have been reduced earlier)]
;W[lq];B[pn];W[ql];B[qn]LB[om:A][nn:B]C[Heavy. White is strong in this part of board and that's why you should play lightly and flexibly, be always ready to sacrifice. This kind of descent aims to keep the opponent divided, but here white groups are already alive and that fact makes this move bad. A or B is better]
;W[ro];B[rn]C[dmg: This part have gone weird

goall: pourquoi tu as un "?"]
(;W[rl]LB[no:A]C[dmg [13k?\]: niveau incertain

dmg [13k?\]: (env 15k kgs)
goall: j'ai eu de la chance
dmg [13k?\]: humm a moins que tu ais pas fait expres de faire le centre je dirais que t'es au moin 1k de plus que moi
goall: si le centre, j'ai fait expr�?s
dmg [13k?\]: et j'ai pe gagne une pierre depuis la derniere fois
dmg [13k?\]: donc t'es plutot bon

A would be severe (see variations)];B[no]C[goall: ???
goall: mais je n'aurais pas poussé];W[nq]C[goall: on est pareil]
;B[nm];W[oe];B[od]C[goall: ben non];W[ne]C[dmg [13k?\]: ffg = federation francaise de go

This move seals the fate of this game. After this whites moyo cannot be reduced or invaded severely. I cannot find a way to turn this game into blacks favor. Only a radical invasion could do the trick.]
;B[lb]LB[nj:A][kl:B]C[The biggest moves are now A and B. m18 is also good because it's sente. Black is in a hurry and should try to keep the sente to be able to reduce as much as possible]

dmg [13k?\]: t'arrive a faire les pb jusqu'a quel niveau ?
goall: ben];B[qp]LB[nj:A][kl:B]C[dmg: That was, I guess, the bigest mistake i made during the game. I've misreaded this sequence to be sente while it was gote. I guess I should have gone to o10 or something like that. I wanted to settle my group so white can't push hard on it but unfortunately, it was gote...

dmg [13k?\]: ca ct une erreur de calcul de ma part
goall: oui
dmg [13k?\]: je pensais prendre en sente
dmg [13k?\]: mais ct gote
dmg [13k?\]: ct cette erreur qui m'a coute
goall: oui
dmg [13k?\]: je pensais faire la sequence en sente
goall: mais ça parait bien
dmg [13k?\]: et envahir le centre ensuite

The corner is small when compared to A and B, and r6 group is already alive. If black insists on playing into the corner, r4 is ok but the following moves should be played differently (see variations)]
;W[qq]
(;B[rp]C[goall: je sais pas];W[rq]C[goall: attend
dmg [13k?\]: oui ?];B[qo]C[goall: 5k je crois
dmg [13k?\]: ok pas mal :)];W[nj]C[dmg [13k?\]: et la ct fini]
;B[jj]LB[ll:A]C[dmg: trying desesperate reduction on the center. White didn't had to kill this stone, just to make territory in the center while pushing it
goall: et toi?

I would say this is too deep. Wouldnt white A be fatal? White is so strong in the center, that if white prevents black from connecting, black will propably die]
;W[kl]C[dmg [13k?\]: environ pareil

A was better];B[mk]
(;W[mj]LB[hh:B][qh:C][lj:A]C[A better (see variations) Protecting C is not as important as protecting B]
;B[lk];W[lj]C[goall: mais c'est quoi sente?];B[kk];W[kj]

Too small. This is gote because white doesn't have to answer. A is more urgent]
