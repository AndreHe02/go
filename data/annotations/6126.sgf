C[tso: Hi!];B[pd]C[jfc: hello];W[dd]C[Zander: Hi.  I'll be reviewing this game for White.]
;B[pp];W[cp];B[dj];W[dh]C[Wasn't sure here whether to enclose my corner or answer D10 or Q 10?

Zander: I'm not sure either, but I think Q10 is a better, bigger move than D12 here.  I think it's good to consider it like taking the move from the opponent (as they say "Your opponent's good move is your good move") - certainly if Black had the move Q10 is preferable.]
;B[cn];W[eq];B[ch];W[cg];B[ci];W[dg];B[pj]
(;W[jp]C[Should I have extended farther?  To O4?
I have read that extending in front of a shimari is "big"

Zander: This looks about right to me.  L4 is too far because it will be easy for Black to invade.  L3 might work, but leaves more threats for Black and is easier to reduce, so I prefer K4.]
;B[jd];W[hd];B[jj]C[I was worried at this point that I am being cut out of the middle.

Zander: It doesn't look like there will be much territory in the middle, but White should worry about being cut off from the whole right side of the board.  This makes a big moyo for Black in the top right, but the corner isn't settled so White can still invade, but your sense is right, it is becoming urgent.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[mq];B[mp]
(;W[lp]C[Would M3 have been better?

Zander: I think M3 turns out slightly better, but N5 is even better.]

;B[qc];W[en];B[jn];W[hn];B[io];W[hp]C[Never sure what to do in these cases?

Zander: This move is good, it lets you cut Black off in at least one direction to limit the damage.]
;B[ip];W[iq];B[jl]
(;W[cl]C[Zander: Black is claiming a very large territory in the upper right.  Even if you manage to kill all of the black stones on the left, Black will win unless you take something from the top/right, so invasion is the most urgent.]
;B[ck];W[dl]
(;B[dk]C[Zander: This move is slow and doesn't make good shape.  Black should just jump out to deal with the threat.]
;W[fk];B[fj];W[ej]C[Would H10 nhave been better?  I knew I needed to get into black's territory.

Zander: If you are trying to kill, this move is better.  If you want to invade Black's territory, H10 doesn't accomplish it, it only cuts off the group on the left.  To invade, you had better play along an edge or somewhere around K13.]

(;W[mc]C[Zander: If you don't save the stone at M16 then Black makes another strong wall and the gain along the edge is small.  I think the variation either gains more on the edge, or gives a good chance to escape into the middle or to the right edge (although I admit it will need a good fight).]
;B[md];W[lb];B[ld];W[nb];B[nc];W[mb];B[oc];W[pb];B[ob];W[oa]
;B[qb];W[kb];B[pc]C[Zander: This move is asking for a response, but if Black captures Q18 and P19, the gain is only about 5 points.  White can ignore this for now since there are bigger plays available.]

Zander: I think so, see the variations.];B[ho];W[gp];B[go];W[fo]
;B[gn];W[hl]C[prbably not a good move?

Zander: Not bad.  There's no sure way to save H6, but this threatens to do so and helps support a possible (optimistic) threat to cut at J9.]

(;W[gm];B[in];W[gk];B[fm];W[gl];B[fn]
(;W[el]C[Zander: The group at F9 has two escapes, at E8 or H10, but F5 is more precarious.  Better to take a move to secure the stones at the bottom which have become overextended.]
;B[em];W[dn];B[dm];W[cm];B[eo];W[do];B[fp]

(;W[fg]C[Should i have extended into black's territory from m13 instead?

Zander: Yes.  Your loss at the top can be limited to about 10 points, and an invasion of Black's giant territory on the right should easily outweigh that.]
;B[lh];W[mg];B[li]
(;W[pi]C[I figured the invasion wouldn't work, but kenw i had to try.

Zander: It would be nice to save the stones at M13, but I think the best hope for a successful invasion is for White to make eyes at the edge, so a play on the third line is better.]
