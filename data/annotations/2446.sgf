C[X: My last two reviews were of games by almost total beginners, so I had to deal mostly with tactical blunders.  Here, your problems were mostly strategic; your tactics are okay for the most part.  I hope my comments help.  All of my comments will be prefixed with "X" (for "Xopods"; my IGS username) to distinguish them from your own.

some big fights that i somehow won. would like a stronger players opinon on them. thanks]

(;B[jd]C[X: This is your first mistake.  With the enclosure at the bottom left and a stone in the top left, a White stone at or around D10 would be ideal.  Your opponent's good move is your good move, so you should play e.g. C10 before he gets a chance to play in that area.  

Also, I think the bottom is bigger than the top, so even if you weren't going to play C10, I'd prefer K3, since it threatens to cut in under his shimari (the price he has to pay for choosing E4 instead of the keima shimari at E3).  

The stone at D17 is on the third line, and third line groups are "stable."  A fourth line group is "developping," and there is a proverb that you shouldn't develop next to a stable group.  

See the variation for one example of how the players might have chosen to play.]

(;W[gd]C[X: Fortunately, White also doesn't know about the wonderfulness of D10.]

(;B[de]C[these types of situations i am very weak with. how would you handle this?

----

X: Well, C10 is still great.  I'm not sure how great this move is, though, because G16 allows White to deviate from the regular joseki and make a great extension/pincer attack.]

;W[gb];B[hc];W[bc]C[i veiwed this result as a moderate success. could i have done better?

X: Well, you've give White something resembling a wall facing his shimari... as you say later, "the left side is scary."  Now a wedge at C9 is REALLY urgent... imagine White playing there.]
;B[md]C[X: Way too small.  C10 is very important, and K3 is still big.]
;W[qc]C[probably the biggest move for W but i get alot of influance... i don't know, good or bad choice for w?

X: Not good.  K3 and C9 are both huge.  If he wants to play here, R14 is better for White, or maybe a tricky submarine move at S15.]

(;B[pc]C[X: Bad bad bad... always block on the side with the wider extension.  You end up so overconcentrated on the top now... and because of White G19, you can't even get much territory there.]

;B[hf]TR[cj][qm][jp][nq]C[this was pretty big i thought. but i also considered playing by the triangles as well. hard to tell which is the biggest move

----

X: You're just adding more stones to an area where you're already overconcentrated while the rest of the board is wide open.  C9 is still the biggest move on the board, followed by K3.]
;W[nq];B[pn]C[X: No, no, no.  Because you blocked on the wrong side in the top right, you won't be making much territory on the right side.  Plus, if you let him play the usual joseki, he'll get K3, which, you'll recall me saying, is huge.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[kp]C[X: K3 better for White.  But anyway, White is, I would say, about 35 points in the lead right now.  You've got a small territory on the right (which is still open for invasion or reduction at Q9 or R8), and a small, very, very overconcentrated territory at the top.  White's moyo takes up practically the entire left and bottom sides of the board.  

There's no way you should win this game now, but White makes some ridiculous mistakes later on.]

(;B[cn]TR[pl]C[here instead maybe...seemed that the left side was looking very scary

----

X: Triangled point is way too small to play now.  Imagine you play there and White plays C9...

So, playing on the left side is the right idea, but you're way too close to his shimari.  A shimari is strong.  Stay away from it.  He's also strong on the top though, so you should probably play towards the middle... C9.]
;W[dl]TR[cl]C[X: I'd prefer a low pincer at C8 for White.];B[do]
;W[dp]C[X: This is aji keshi.  If you're going to win the game (without huge blunders by White), you'll need to invade the lower side eventually.  Leaving open the option of a kikashi at D3 would help your chances there a lot.  I would just jump out at E6.]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[bl];W[bk];B[en]TR[dm]C[X: D7 is much better shape.]

(;W[ol]C[I think that this stone should be at q8

----

X: Even deeper, actually.  White could try R8.  But Since White is winning, White should play more safely.  If he wants to do something about your right side, he should play a shoulder hit at Q9.]

(;B[pl]C[X: For defending territory, I would prefer to play one line lower, at R8... but you're losing, and you're strong here.  You should attack.  Playing contact is terrible, because it strengthens his stone.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[ok]
(;B[oi]C[X: Always attack from the side where you're weaker.  You want to drive him against the strength in the upper right..  P7 better.]
;W[mj];B[mi]C[now we begin a fight i was not totaly confident in. comments on this part are most welcome.

----

X: You shouldn't win this fight.  White played badly and threw away a won game.  He should just play carefully, build up some strength on the right, then launch a severe attack on your stones around C6 (that group is still a long way from being alive) and consolidate his bottom territory in the process.]

(;W[li];B[lj]C[seemed good although i am hard pressed as to why i think this....just seems right to me

----

X: Looked fine to me.  Anyway, given the way this game went, I'd say your tactics ARE your strong suit.  Your strategy in the fuseki and early middle game caused you big problems, and your fighting tactics (and some big mistakes by White) saved the game for you.]

[rm][dn][fn][gn][hn][in][jn][ln][rn][fo][lo][kp][jq]C[X: Looks a pretty close game (although I didn't count, so I don't know who wins)... but you should have lost badly.  Look at it; even with all the stones you killed, you still don't have that much territory, and White could have had much more along the bottom.  

Your biggest problem is overconcentration, making a small, really, really, really secure territory, instead of trying to develop over the board more quickly.  

Things to remember:

a) Wide extension in front of a shimari is a huge move. 

b) Extension from a wall is also huge.

c) So if a move would be a wide extension from a wall AND a shimari, it's "double-huge."

d) Avoid overconcentration.

e) When choosing which side to block a 3-3 point invasion on, choose the side where you've already got a wide extension in place.

f) When someone plays a reducing move, consider attacking it, rather than just defending your territory: forcing you to defend your territory while making it smaller in the process is exactly what your opponent wants.  If you're strong in the vicinity, attack!  Even if you don't kill the stone (and killing it should not be your goal, unless the reduction was really unreasonable in the first place), you will likely be able to build up enough strength to do the same (or greater) amount of damage to your opponent's territory, or make territory elsewhere.]
