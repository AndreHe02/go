AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hello , Mr. Lawrence Ku .

I am the reviewer for your game . I am IGS5D and maybe
3 to 4 handicaps Go strength different from prof. players  . I will basically review this game for black side . 

I think you must take plenty of time to make that SGF file. there are so many branches inside the original SGF file and I appreciated on your hard study . But to simplify  the process and avoid confusing , I would like to remove all the branches from SGF file and give u my understanding of that game .]
;W[ed];B[cc]C[It is a 3 handicaps game . So at the beginning , Black gain 
more than 30 komi advantage .

B2 is full of spirit . It seems black never fear to have a fight .]
;W[ce]
(;B[dd]C[So B4 seems the first bad stone for Black Side];W[de]
;B[ec]
(;W[fc]LB[fd:A]C[how ever W7 is little bit dangerous . black actually can cut 
at A and eat w7 .Again say thanks to the Black Stone at right down corner]

(;B[fb]C[B8 lose this change . SO in this battle , white gain some points as white becomes thick .]
;W[fd];B[gb];W[ck];B[cm]C[B12 is the biggest point on the board at this moment]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cr];W[fo];B[do]C[from 16 to 20 , Black plays very cool . 14 komi gained in the corner]
;W[hq];B[qj]C[Again 22 is very good indeed , now black absolutely leads the game although there are some small loss at the left up corner]
;W[pm]C[23 , A typical handicaps game stone !];B[qm];W[ql];B[pl]
;W[om];B[ol];W[qn];B[rm]
(;W[qo]C[But white 31 is not a very good move as Black side later can control the middle and become very thick .]
;B[po];W[rl];B[nm];W[on];B[nn];W[oo];B[np];W[sm]C[although it is not a ladder but black plays in a right way to suspress the white . white can make live in such a small place and black certain gain the power in the middle .]

(;B[no];W[rn]
(;B[oq]LB[qm:A][mq:B]C[42 is a mistake . Black could choose A or B .
certainly is better .];W[qq]
(;B[mq]C[B44 again is a weak . as black is so thick now the task is attacking .

It seems white has too much conerns about the safety . it is surely not good whie playing handicaps game . 

How ever ever black made some wrong moves before , as black choose the right way in the right corner , now it is still a easy game for black .]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[pj];B[pi];W[oj]
(;B[oh]LB[oi:A]C[52 is soft and bad shape . certainly it should be replaced by A . see the branch before]
;W[nf];B[mh];W[nl]LB[lg:A]C[as white 55 cuts the 2 black stones, what black should do next?

I suggest to keep the taste in the middle and attack the white dragon in the up-right first . eventhough , the target is not kill that group but to

1. build the thickness in the middle for 54,52 group 
2. consolide the territory in the right corner 
3. get the right chance to counter attack the 51 and 49 . 

that is we call 'one stone , shoot down 3 birds:-)"

So I can see A is a good place to put the black stone next .]
;B[nk];W[ml];B[ok];W[oi]C[in the real game , black choose to fight directly . well it is depand on individual fighting skill .]

what a easy game if black play like that .
