C[DC: Hi, My name is Dylan Carter I have been playing Go for a year. I don't really care about my strength all I seek is advise.

In this game I lost by 3.5 points and need to now if I could have played a little more losely and won maybe. I don't think I played particulaly badly and was also wondering if you could provide a few variations with differing styles of play in the fuseki if possible.

Thank you in advance.


Simba [6k\]: Hallo again

djna: This is a difficult game to comment on. The game hinges in the outcome of various battles in the centre, several groups come under threat. I would not be confident of analyzsing this situations accurately here - let alone over the board. 

I also believe that commentries that show detailed analyses of such positions are unlikely to be helpful - if you can't read those sequences in actual play how can you use the comments? 

So I want to find some other things to talk about, I hope that I found some ... 

The thing I nsee happening is B doing a lot of pushing from the inside of situations - corners invaded with W getting thickness, stones captured in preference to breaking into the open, eyes taken in preference to connecting on the outside. I'd suggest looking at books about thickness, looking at Tekemiya's games and focus on building influence in preference to territory.

Thanks for letting me see this exciting game.];B[pd]C[Dreamrace [6k\]: you play very well though different]
;W[dc]C[Dreamrace [6k\]: I want to take something from you
Simba [6k\]: i dont know any joseki];B[pp];W[dp];B[jd]LB[de:B]
[pj:A]C[
djna: more convention to play A, san-ren-sai and build a Black tructure or play  B to prevent the shimari. I'm not sure that this move is wrong, but if the motivation is to dodge complexity arising from playing B then I think it's a mistake. If the motivation is ntry a new idea, then good.]
;W[nq]C[Simba [6k\]: i read no books];B[pn];W[kp];B[qk]LB[pj:B]
[qj:A]C[
djna: I think that this is bad - there's no good realtionship with teh upper right. A or B would be better.]
;W[qf]C[
djna: reasonable for W - get into the B structure on the wider side.]

(;B[nd]C[
djna: I don't like this. W has come into B's sphere of influence and yet he's not under any pressure. See variations]
;W[qi];B[rd]TR[qk]C[
djna this is quite big, and exploits the fact that the marked stone is strong]
;W[oi]C[
djna: I think W needs to add a move such as this, so B has sente]
;B[cn]C[
djna: I feel that the top left is more important, I don't like unresolved 3-4 stones.]
;W[fq]TR[kp]C[
djna: seems like a slightly conservatice move by W, but It's hard to a better way to pkay to have a realtionship with the marked stone]
;B[bp]C[
djna - natural, but ...];W[cl]C[djna: this joseki can leave B confined to the corner unless B knows some alternatives]
;B[cq]C[
djna: this is correct];W[co]TR[do]
(;B[bn]LB[dj:C][dk:B][bp:A]TR[cl]C[djna: this is a mistake, see the variations

However, I don't see a really good result for B after that marked  pincer, hence although A seems really obvious perhaps B or C would  be better.]
;W[dn]LB[bo:A]C[
djna: After this move Black seems vulnerable, W A removes eyes.
I think that B shoule play at A and revert to the joseki];B[hp]
C[
djna: this is a "jealous" move.  Two problems:

1). How sure are we that B is alive in the corner?

2). W is entitled to something on the outside - B chose to live in the corner => logically, unless W has made a mistake he must get some compensation. To attempt to deny W his share is "jealous" and can only lead to trouble:

"Play away from thickness" is the proverb.

See the variation for W's attack, note how even if the attack doens't kill W get's huge thickness to attack the invading stone.]

(;W[dq];B[cr]LB[cm:C][ao:B][bo:A]TR[bp][cp][cq]C[
djna: The L group (marked ) is dead, hence 

White A, Black B, W C is sente against the B group. W should play that.]
;W[hc]LB[cm:C][ao:B][bo:A][dr:D]TR[hp]C[
djna:  This is nice as W can begin to build a serious top left and it's also almost sente against B's top. 

But first I would want to attack the makred stone now, especially after play the A, B, C, D, sequence.

By playing the  "jealous" move B has given W the initiative.]
;B[ce]C[
djna: Seems almost obligatory, but B is starting a new group that's likely to be a burden.

"if you have two weak groups, one of them is dead"];W[cg];B[ee]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B[df]C[
djna: I think that this is a very dangerous move. What did you expect after the cut?]
;W[cf];B[db];W[fb]C[
djna: does A work for W?  This seems to give B more that he deserves.

Either way B is just alive in the corner but W builds more strength]
;B[ec];W[ed];B[eb];W[fc];B[bb];W[fg]TR[ld]C[
djna: given that I belive that W can seal off the left in sente I think that W has a decent game now. 

However W has thickness and potential, not territory. His problem is to use that thickness.

Note that  B has a  weakness at the marked point];B[hm]LB[jc:A]
[mi:C][hm:D][or:B]TR[qf][oi][qi]C[
djna: B needs a plan:

Possibilities:

1). Take some big points such as A or B.
Probably W can take bigger ones.

2). Attack the marked group. Build some strength so that D has some support. Would W panic if you played C?

I'd try this

3). Make things really complicated and hope that W fouls up.
Well this plan nearly works! 

So maybe your idea is best!];W[kn]LB[dm:A][jq:B]C[

djna: How confident is W about the potential for a B cut around A?

I would want to deny the two black stones a base and threathen to link mine by playing B]
;B[jq];W[kq];B[jr]LB[jp:A]C[
djna: perhaps better to play A, W makes B very heavy now.];W[hr]
;B[hq];W[gr];B[pr]C[
djna: this is a decent idea by B, take some profit and give W a group to worry about.

But his own shape is too flimsy.];W[jp];B[iq]C[
djna: problem is that B wants to keep W separated but is now building a group he can't]
;W[in]C[
djna suddenly B has bad shape and W has good shape.


It's very hard to spot this coming and avoid it. Just watch a game between a 6d and a 1d and you'll see the 1d suffer in the same way.]
;B[hn];W[go]LB[ho:A]TR[hm][hn]C[

djna: what happens if W cuts at A now? I think that there's a chance that the marked stones get cut off on a husge scale.]
;B[ho]C[
djna: now things are hotting up!];W[jk];B[dm]C[
djna: pounce! W should have patched this weakness a long time ago.

But I beleive that B can be reduced to one eye in the corner.]
;W[em];B[en];W[do];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[el];B[gm];W[cm]C[
djna: W could grow a huge side now, B must not get confineed]
;B[fp]C[
djna: so this seems bad to me, taking an eye in gote is the wrong priority.]
;W[hk]LB[gk:A]C[
djna: my instinct is to prefer A. I want to take profit and keep the pressure on B]
;B[gk];W[fj]C[
djna: the W side is now too small, assuming that B lives then he has more territory]
;B[hj];W[ik];B[gj];W[fi];B[ih];W[if]LB[lc:C][oi:2][jk:1][pk:A]
[pl:B]C[
djna: W probably needs to do something more dramatic.

Perhaps play A or B or some such to ensure that groups 1 and two are solid , in sente and then play C, the ove W played is pushing from a strng group towards a weaker one, so problems are likely]

djna: now W has some problems];W[km];B[jl];W[il];B[io]LB[kc:A]
TR[ml][mm][nm]SQ[bn][cn]C[

djna: B should focus on confining the W group, not taking it's eyes

Moves in the makred area are helping the B group and asking W "show me your eyes"

By my count, even assuming that the marked B stones can be captured (and I think they can)  if B gets to patch up near A he's ahead. So it's enough to ensure that the snake lives in sente and play A.]

No more comments after this.

Bottom line, I think that Black B was where B missed the major opportunity to close out the game.]

djna: this is the alternative for B, but finding it unless you've studied the joseki is tough. Also note that it is valid whether W has the marked stone or has played higth at A instead - but the variations are different in the two cases.

I think that these josekis are quite useful in real life and so are worth studying.]
