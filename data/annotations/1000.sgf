C[At this, I don't know where is the best .

A: This is not a  bad point, the other options beeing O17, L17 or around K4.. I would've played L17 but I think
this is more a matter of style than anything else...]
MA[nc][kc][jp];W[qo]
C[This is not so good, Q5 is a weak stone (Q10 acts as a sort of pincer) so attaching to it makes it stronger.
It is better to play O4.]
MA[pj][po][np];B[qn];W[qp];B[pn]
C[Too heavy, the stone at Q10 means that after white O3, black has no good continuation. Black should play
O6 or P8 instead.]

C[Now W gets the important point on the upper side - This game is already very difficult for black.]
;B[nc]
C[Looks wrong, black is invading in the middle of whites strong area. This is bound to lead to some kind of loss.
I think it is better to be patient, and then to invade at R17 at the right time.

C[Black lives without this move, so it is better to play a big point like K4 or F17.]
MA[jp][fc];W[fc];B[nb]
C[This is wrong. N16 and O18 stones have served their purpose (to facilitate invading the corner) and are now light, this move makes them heavy. To make these stones live (if possible) will make white increadibly strong.]

C[Now W has secure profit and B has a weak group that needs to make life in some way. In addition, black
didn't answer F17, so there is a loss in the corner as well...]

so they won't have to live separated...]

C[I don't understand the reason for this move. Is it an attempt to cut W? The sequence ends in gote for black,
without making any significant profit - so I think it is bad.]

C[Black's biggest problem is distinguishing 'light' and 'heavy' in the opening/middle game. Heavy stones are
the ones that you will have to pay a heavy price to make life for, light stones are the stones that are difficult to
capture as a whole - i.e. capturing one stone will just help the others escape.
In a sense Q6 is the turning point of the game, B makes heavy shape W gets an attack going and B spends the rest of the game trying to catch up...

I hope the review was not too much critisism, there are also some very nice moves like N10 but I was concentrating mostly on the mistakes...])
