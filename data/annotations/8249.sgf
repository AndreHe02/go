C[white: Hello, and thank you for reviewing this. In this game my opponent left some weak groups but I didn't manage to profit from attacking them. The game feels really weird because every white move seems questionable to me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello! My name is Kalle, and I'll start my comments in the game with "Kalle:".

First I want to say that not every white move was questionable at all! For example, you managed to build some nice thickness towards the right side while attacking the lower side black group (moves 64, 68 and 70). Maybe you didn't appreciate this thickness very much, because you wanted to kill the black group and didn't succeed?

After that, Black started reducing your moyo, and I think you could have been more aggressive there to get a better result. In the end you started a ko, which was incredibly big. Maybe neither of you truly appreciated the worth of this ko, which I think was huge. Black got a good result by connecting the ko, but still after that you we're leading in the game in my opinion.

I think you might be a little obsessed with attacking to kill, overlooking some other aspects of attacking. The game wasn't looking at all as bad for you as one might guess from your comment above. If you calm your style down a little bit and start building your own game after attacks, you might get better results in the future. I hope my advice will be useful, have fun and enjoy Go in the future!]

;B[cl]C[Kalle: This move is very unusual, I think. Your play seems natural after this, but something bother's me about the end result. I'll say something more about it later.]
;W[bm];B[dk];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[gr];W[hq];B[jq]
LB[dp:A]C[Kalle: You should now play at A, before Black gets there.]
(;W[ir]LB[hr:B][jr:A]TR[dk][cl]SQ[jq][nq]C[Kalle: This move is bad, it helps black to defend his group.

The natural continuation for Black is to decend to A, which he did in the game. After that, Black is threatening to connect on the second line, so you have to play another move, if you want to separate. But then you are just helping Black some more to build good shape.

It's better to play just straight down at B, if you want to separate Black. That way Black won't have a nice move to both make shape and threaten to connect.

The thing is, I feel that playing down on the second and first line here is not what your shape asks you to do. You should try to make good shape in the center first and then see where to play next. The triangled stones on the left still lack an extension, and you would get a really nice attack against them, if your own group is made strong first. On the other hand the black stones on the lower side are also weak, even if they threaten to cross under, so you have two targets to aim for. In such situations you should fix the shape first, look at your opponent's reply and then decide what to do.]
;B[jr];W[dp];B[cr];W[js];B[hr];W[iq];B[ks];W[is];B[kr]
(;W[pr]LB[en:A]C[Kalle: You are clearly aiming at taking the base off from the Black group. It's a little problematic now, because your own group on the left is quite fragile. It looks strong, but it is in effect a string of stones without eyes, and the forcing move at A looks worrisome.]
;B[jo]C[Kalle: This move brings Black out to the center and makes it more difficult for you to build a good shape.]
;W[cj]C[Kalle: The attack is premature. You need to fix your shape first, only then attack.]
;B[bl];W[cf];B[df];W[cg];B[ce];W[ei];B[dj];W[di];B[fk];W[hk]
C[Kalle: At this point, the situation of your lower side group starts to look really dangerous. That peep at A is severe and Black will probably be able to at least seal you in, if not completely kill.]
;B[gj];W[gh];B[hj];W[jk];B[en]C[Kalle: Black strikes at the vital point.]
;W[dn];B[ck]C[Kalle: I don't understand this move, but it's good to answer it, as you did.]
;W[bj]
(;B[fo]C[Kalle: Black gets too greedy here. He should try to surround you in a bigger scale, not take the eyes away (see variation).]
;W[gn]C[Kalle: A good reply.];B[go];W[ho];B[hn];W[in];B[hm]
;W[io];B[gm];W[jn]C[Kalle: You were lucky to come out so nicely, now things are looking good for you. Giving up the stones on the left is big, but so is the attack you now have against the black lower side group.]
;B[ep]C[Kalle: Black chooses the safe points and ignores the situation on the right. Now it's time to take the initiative!]
;W[no]C[Kalle: The right move.];B[or]C[Kalle: Maybe it's best to just answer this move. Your shape in the corner is full of holes if you tenuki this move. On the other hand, fixing the shape there will immediately bring you many secure points (almost ten) and Black has to answer anyway.]
(;W[lq]LB[ko:A]C[Kalle: This is a severe-looking move. If you play this kind of move, it means you have decided to kill the group, or you're looking for some neat tesuji or forcing moves that require a placement first. In either case, you have to read hard beforehand to make sure the sequence is there and works. You shouldn't back up once you go in.

In this case Black replied at A and you started to surround from the outside. This way you get a worse result than just skipping the inside move and playing straight from the outside. That is the reason why you have to stick to what you're doing and not change the course. If it leads to a bad result, at least you can learn something about your initial judgement! :)]
;B[ko]
(;W[lm]C[Kalle: You are changing the direction. What if you really attack to kill? (see variation)]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[lp]LB[cc:A]C[Kalle: At this point we can assess the position.

The Black group has lived and you have lost some stones on the left side. On the other hand you dominate the right side of the board and you have sente. The lower right corner still has some aji, but so does the upper left Black corner. Notice the weak point at A. You have all the reason to feel hopeful about this position.]
;W[mr]C[Kalle: Did you see a sequence here? To me it looks like you were not sure if there's something here or not, so you wanted to try it out. It's really important not to play these kind of moves for nothing, just to see whether there is something or not.

There are two reasons.

First, there might be something, but you haven't found it yet. You should wait a little and return to this part later, if you have found something interesting there.

The second reason is that you are destroying the aji that remains here even if there is no grand sequence to kill the whole group. Consider for example, that in the ko fight you started later, you would have really liked to have these moves unplayed in order to use them as threats.]
;B[pq]C[Kalle: Your opponent helps you to fix the corner, which is very nice.]
;W[qq];B[oq];W[qr];B[kq];W[jp];B[lr];W[mq];B[ms];W[ns];B[nr]
;W[pi]C[Kalle: This is the big point. You should be able to easily compensate for the loss of you stones on the left side.]
;B[kl]LB[jl:A]C[Kalle: This feels like a thank-you move to me. I would answer this move at A, to strengthen the central influence. Your answer is pretty OK too, I think.]
(;W[kn]LB[jl:A]C[Kalle: This is a bit submissive, and now Black has the cut starting at A. But on the other hand you're better connected to the right side this way.]
;B[oj]C[Kalle: Black reduces. I think the best way to deal with this shoulder hit is just to push up. Black will be in trouble because he can't both escape with his stone and prevent you from making a big moyo around the top right corner.]
(;W[pj]C[Kalle: This way you are taking fourth line territory, but you're pushing Black from behind and giving him chances to fix his shape. If Black can easily manage his reduction stones while giving you only fourth line territory here, he has succeeded too well.]
;B[ol]LB[ok:A]C[Kalle: Now I think it's important to wedge at A. This makes your shape srong while leaving him with cutting points.]
(;W[ql]C[Kalle: This move is very passive. You allow Black to push you down and have an easy time inside your moyo.]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[oi];W[nk];B[ok];W[ph];B[nl]LB[ng:A]C[Kalle: The peep left Black with bad shape, but he's not worried about getting out from your moyo. You should take the big point at A and build up your moyo, while threatening the black group.]
(;W[lk];B[mk];W[mj];B[ml];W[ll]LB[mi:A]C[Kalle: Now Black should take the shape point at A, but he lets you occupy it.]
;B[nj];W[mi]C[Kalle: This is a really good situation for you. Black is stuck between your stones, which all have good shape, and he has only one eye.

You should just look for those moves that best fit in with the already existing ones, to maintain good shape and to build up your moyo, while pushing the black group out to the center. You don't need to kill to get a ridiculously good result from an attack.]
;B[on]LB[oh:A][lo:B]C[Kalle: Now the question is, does something horrible happen if you just seal Black in? My first instinct would be to play at A immediately. Since you are connected out with your bottom side stones and because you have the atari at B in reserve, I think you can safely seal Black in and he will have a hard time surviving.]
(;W[pm];B[nh]LB[nf:A][oh:B]C[Kalle: You can play at A now, because B is sente for you. Black can't come through. A is the right direction, because it builds up your moyo.]
(;W[lg]C[Kalle: The direction of this stone is towards the center, but it's impossible to make any territory there because of the strong black group. That's why this move is inefficient.]
;B[nf];W[og];B[mh];W[lh];B[mf];W[lf]C[Kalle: You're again stressing the center, but your side is suffering.]
;B[pe]LB[oe:A]C[Kalle: Here the attachment at A might work. You get a good looking ko from it.]
(;W[nd];B[of]
(;W[qg]LB[qd:A]C[Kalle: This is a weird shape. I understand that you're all the time trying to kill, but here it would be more profitable to think: how can I get the most while letting him live? Taking the corner with A for example is very big, and it would actually limit his eye space just as much as this move.]
;B[qc]LB[qb:A]C[Kalle: The peaceful way would be to answer at A. The result would be quite ok for you.]
;W[pd];B[qd];W[qe];B[qf];W[re];B[rf];W[pf]C[Kalle: This ko is a good find, and it is worth about 30-40 points regardless of whether the black group lives or doesn't. The ko will decide the corner and some side territory, and also the fate of your three stones in the top (marked). Whether these stones are strong and connected or weak (almost captured after Black wins the ko) will have a huge impact on the future play on the top side of the board. You should try to win this ko with almost any price.]
;B[pg];W[ej]C[Kalle: Black should almost ignore this threat, but it is actually quite close to the value of the ko I think. So it's ok for him to answer.]
;B[ek];W[pf];B[li]C[Kalle: Black is threatening to take two stones, which have no value to you except if you think you can kill the black group. If you now take the ko, you will probably win the game. The fact is that the ko is so big that neither of you have big enough threats to play it really.]
;W[lj];B[pg]LB[oh:B][bq:A]C[Kalle: Now you have to threaten at A or B, anything else is too small compared to the ko.]
(;W[eo];B[pf]
(;W[fp]LB[em:A]C[Kalle: This move would be better at A.];B[hh]
C[Kalle: Black realises that he's under attack - again. You're not far from getting him this time either, but he seems to find the right moves to make good shape. Still, if you seal him in and turn your attention to the top you have fair chances of winning.]
;W[hg];B[ih];W[ig];B[ij];W[ik];B[em];W[gl];B[fl];W[fn];B[fm]
;W[dl];B[gi]LB[fh:A]C[Kalle: The only move is at A.]
(;W[gk];B[fj];W[ii];B[fh]C[Kalle: After this, White collapses. You had good opportunities and good attacks. The main problem seems to be that you are too focused on killing, and too little interested in building your own moyos and territories. If you manage to combine these two aspects, you will be much stronger in the future.

Take care and enjoy Go!

In the top right you have the sente move of A to help you make shape, you should play that first.

Then, you should attack on the left. I will provide a possible continuation.]
