C[Comment: Andre Bergholz, (2K) in Germany, berge on IGS, NNGS (Comments marked with AB)]
;B[pd]C[AB: I hope you got also hints from your opponent who seems to be stronger than me. Altogether your performance is not too bad, stronger than 10k I would say.]
;W[pp];B[dq];W[dd];B[fc]C[AB: I cannot comment on the fuseki very much because this is a very difficult part of the game. I would prefer a kakari from the other side but as I say I am not sure.]
;W[df];B[ch];W[eg];B[ck]C[AB: Good.];W[jc];B[db];W[cc];B[hc]
;W[nc];B[nd]LB[lc:A][qf:B]C[AB: This is not good, I think. An immediate invasion at ´A´ seems good. If you are not willing to do that a solid move like ´B´ would still be better because you leave the invasion as an option for later. With the move that you play you are strengthen the white group which is definitely not what you want.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[oe];B[pc];W[mc];B[pe];W[of]
(;B[jd]C[AB: What is the purpose of this exchange? I would keep pushing on the right side as in the variation. White cannot ignore this.]
;W[kd];B[qn]C[AB: Definitely keep pushing! I also think that a kakari from the other side is more interesting because it would work well with a shimari in the lower left.]
;W[pf]C[AB: Very big!];B[nq];W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qp]LB[jp:A]
C[AB: Maybe you should switch to the lower side with ´A´ now. Just a thought, though...]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[po]
(;B[qm]C[AB: A mistake in the joseki. You should play like in the variation.]
;W[rp];B[qi]C[AB: It´s a good move but it provokes the White sequence.]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[rf]
(;B[qq]LB[re:A][rn:B]TR[ro]C[AB: Very bad! White can always capture the marked stone because of your joseki mistake. I think you should atari at ´A´ first because White cannot get ino the corner in sente then (see variation). Locally it is better to connect at ´B´, White captures the R4 stone then. This is not urgent, though.]
;W[rq];B[pq];W[rn];B[rm];W[so]C[AB: This is obviously bad for Black since you have weak groups on both sides now.]
;B[do]LB[oi:A][mp:B]C[AB: Certainly a big move but moves to strengthen your stones like ´A´ or something around ´B´ are probably more urgent.]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[sc];B[sb];W[sd];B[qb];W[ob];B[pb];W[om]C[AB: This is a very important point.]
;B[jq];W[qk]C[AB: Your stones are in serious trouble now.];B[pk]
;W[pj];B[ok];W[qj];B[oj];W[pi];B[jo]C[AB: This builds a huge moyo, but your stones remain in trouble. You can´t expect to get the complete lower left.]
;W[oi];B[mj];W[cq];B[dr];W[cn];B[cp];W[bp];B[dn];W[co]
(;B[gp]LB[dp:A][dm:B][bq:C]C[AB: This is a typo, right? If not, then this is by far the worst move of the game. Your one and only option is to connet at ´A´. Above all this will make the White hane at  ´B´ impossible. Furthermore you can later get the corner for yourself by playing ´C´ (see variations).]
;W[dp];B[ep];W[dm]C[AB: Now the game is lost. Your moyo is gone and you get another weak group on the left instead.]
;B[em];W[dl];B[dk]LB[bl:A]C[AB: It´s difficult to play in such a terrible situation. Yet, I would prefer the peep at ´A´ since this gives your group a solid shape.]
;W[el];B[fm];W[fl];B[gm];W[cg];B[bh];W[dh];B[di];W[ei];B[dj]
;W[bl];B[cl]C[*daveg*: back :)];W[cm];B[bk];W[bg];B[ag]LB[bm:A]
C[AB: I think you should capture the stone with ´A´ immediately to ensure life for your group.]
;W[af];B[ah];W[be];B[cb];W[am]C[AB: Now White saves the stone in sente.]
;B[ej];W[fj];B[fk];W[fi];B[bj];W[gl];B[mf]TR[nd]C[AB: Bad! This is way too close to White´s thickness. Saving the marked cutting stone is not interesting since both White groups are more or less alive.]
;W[mi]TR[nd][mf][mj][oj][ok][pk][pm][qm][qn][rm][qi]LB[mm:A]
C[AB: Of course White ignores this and tries to launch an attack on all your marked stones on the right. Actually I think a White move at  ´A´ would be even more effective (more risky, though).]
;B[mk];W[li];B[je];W[ic];B[hb];W[ke];B[jf];W[kf];B[ge]LB[he:A]
C[AB: ´A´ seems to be better shape (and the game proves me right :-)).]
;W[hm];B[gn]LB[fo:A]C[AB: This can impossibly be the correct move. Try ´A´ instead.]
;W[jn];B[ko];W[lm]TR[mj][mk][oj][ok][pk][pm][qm][qn][rm]LB[pl:A]
C[AB: With this leaning attack your stones are gone. It is interesting to point out that White never bothered to capture a smaller part of your group with ´A´.]
;B[kl];W[ll];B[in];W[jm];B[im];W[jl];B[il];W[jk];B[kj];W[lj]
;B[kk];W[lk];B[jj];W[ln];B[kh];W[jg]LB[lg:A]TR[kh][jj][kj][kk]
[kl]C[AB: Again you see that White does not defend with a move around ´A´ but tries to go for the bigger piece of the cake since your marked stones are not save yet.]
;B[ig];W[ih];B[ij];W[hg];B[ie]C[AB: Again, this can´t be the correct move. Try to avoid the empty triangle.]
;W[if]LB[ik:A][hk:B][hj:C]C[AB: Actually I think that White can go all out with ´A´ to ´C´ and capture your middle stones.]
;B[ik];W[mq]
(;B[np]C[AB: I think you should try to stay connected (see variations).]
;W[mp];B[no];W[mo];B[rr];W[nn]C[AB: I don´t know if this one is really necessary. I couldn´t come up with someting...]
;B[mr];W[lr];B[nr];W[kq]C[AB: Nevertheless you by now see that it went not so good for you again. You have to make two more eyes and your territory is split into two.]
;B[jr];W[ki];B[jh]C[AB: No way you are going to save these stones.]
;W[ji];B[cr];W[br];B[gk];W[cp];B[bc];W[bd];B[dc];W[cd];B[ka]
;W[kb];B[ja];W[la];B[ia];W[nb];B[lb];W[ma];B[lc];W[ld];B[oa]
;W[sq]LB[sr:A]C[AB: Don´t ask me why White didn´t play at ´A´.]
;B[sr];W[eo]C[AB: Very big, of course.];B[en];W[eq];B[er];W[fp]
;B[fq];W[ep];B[fo]LB[gq:A]C[AB: A move at ´A´ seems to be more healthy. There are still too many possibilities (aji) in your position. They are worth more than the one or two points.]
;W[hl];B[pa];W[he]C[AB: Finally an end put on the ´bad shape´ stones :-).]
;B[hd];W[id];B[na];W[md];B[mb];W[ho]LB[fr:A][gq:B]C[AB: There we go. The cutting points ´A´ and ´B´ cause lots of trouble.]

AB: Well, overall your game was not too bad. There were just a few key points that you missed. 41 and 75 were the losing moves that can easily be avoided. Generally try to protect your weak stones rather then taking a big territorial point. Try to realize that stronger players attack on a larger scale and create opportunities. Try to avoid bad shape, in particular the empty triangle.
