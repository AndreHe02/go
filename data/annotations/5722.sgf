(;W[fo]C[[ndkrempel\] So far both have played well.];B[dr]C[[ndkrempel\] This is the first questionable move. As soon as you see it, alarm bells should be ringing, as it is not a normal joseki move and looks very low (2nd line) for the opening stage of the game. So you should try to punish it.
What is it trying to do? It looks like trying to connect black's stones underneath, but as as black outnumbers white in this part of the board, it shouldn't matter to white if black connects on the 2nd line like this - it is a passive way of playing.
A normal joseki move for black would be to help the corner by extending up, around the C7 area, so a natural idea for white here is to play in that area, as black has failed to do so.
Another good idea would be to press at H4 to reduce black's potential territory in the area in front of his corner enclosure.
Please see variations for some possible outcomes - the press at H4 seems best to me.]

(;W[er]C[[ndkrempel\] This is a natural idea - by separating black, he can only extend from one group, so you can pressure the other - but perhaps not quite best as black can treat G3 lightly to take a reasonable corner and get an extension from his shimari too (see variation).]

(;B[fr]C[[ndkrempel\] This move leaves the corner too thin.]
;W[dq]C[[ndkrempel\] This is a good punishment.]
(;B[es]
(;W[eq]C[maybe c3 is better?

[ndkrempel\] Yes, C3 was the only move. Connecting at E3 lets black play C3 himself, which makes the D3-C3 exchange extremely bad for white (bad shape, lose liberty, lose potential of playing at C3 instead, lose ko threat.)]
;B[cq]C[[ndkrempel\] Black ends up with a good result - white looks heavy.]
;W[hp]C[[ndkrempel\] Yes, this is probably the best you can do now.]

(;B[hq];W[ip];B[jq]
(;W[jc]C[[ndkrempel\] Good, a big point. Star point can also be played.]
;B[cf]
(;W[ch]C[[ndkrempel\] This direction seems wrong - black has a low strong group sticking out at C4, while white also has some influence at F5, so the left side is not interesting. Perhaps simply jump, or tsuke instead.]

(;B[ef];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[cj];W[eh];B[bh]C[[ndkrempel\] This black move is not good, he should look to attack C12 rather than letting it live easily like this.]

(;W[bi]C[[ndkrempel\] It's better to hane on the other side as it creates a more severe cutting point in black's shape (see variation).]

(;W[bj];B[ck];W[bk];B[cl];W[ei];B[bf];W[ah];B[di];W[ej]C[[ndkrempel\] These 3 stones are not useful for you - black is too strong to attack him severely - so they are just a burden. Black may be able to engineer a splitting attack between them and F5.
It would have been better to take a big fuseki point on the right hand side of the board.]
;B[af];W[ag];B[qf];W[qh]C[[ndkrempel\] On this side of the board, a pincer is reasonable.]
;B[of];W[nd]C[typically I am playing too fast.  At this point I wasn't worried about a splitting attack on the left center area.  Should I have worried?

[ndkrempel\] If black attacks now, it may be best to give up the three E10 stones for now, and make the F5 group safe first as it is bigger.]
;B[rd];W[qc];B[qj];W[oh];B[rh]C[[ndkrempel\] Black's favourite move!]

(;W[ri]C[[ndkrempel\] As last time, hane on the other side a little better (see variation).]

[ndkrempel\] Good to hear it :)];B[gb];W[bc]C[I seem to be cut into more separate groups than usual in this game.  Is that a major problem here?  It still seems a reasonable game for white at this point, except for the three isolated stones in the center right.

[ndkrempel\] Actually white has been behind since E3 instead of C3, but it may be possible to recover if your opponent makes some mistakes. The three separate weak groups is indeed a problem and make it very hard for white to invade anywhere. In the middle game, the strength of stones is most important, so try to strengthen your weak group(s) instead of making new ones.]

(;W[nq]C[[ndkrempel\] This move is a little heavy.];B[op]C[[ndkrempel\] Black has failed to attack in this game. This kind of cut is a fighting move, not an attacking one - it will help you settle your stones more easily.]
;W[mp]C[[ndkrempel\] Good idea.];B[oo];W[mn];B[ol]
(;W[nl]C[[ndkrempel\] This is too blunt, as black can cut it as he does. Probably the best you can do is to try to indirectly rescue them with an attack on H11 stones.]

;W[ij];B[jj];W[ih];B[hh];W[ii]C[Looking back on this game I now feel I was stubborn and foolish.  Any practical advice?

[ndkrempel\] In the middle-game, be more aware of the strengths and weaknesses of groups, and that putting a stone on the board is a commitment to it - you have to look after it unless it's a deliberate sacrifice.

In this particular game, you fell behind in the fuseki with the bottom left corner escapade. There you had a good idea with D3, but didn't follow through by playing C3, perhaps you wanted to save every stone after E1 atari??]

No comments are needed after this unless you want to point out technique mistakes.  While this is worse than I play now, the bad attitude problems are still there, such as stubbornness.  Comments and suggestions in this area would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for taking time to look at this game for me.

[ndkrempel\] Recognising any problems you have is more than half way there! I'm not sure what time settings you play with, but perhaps just pause to think a little bit longer before you a play a move, particularly in a new situation, make your plans flexibly, and bear in mind the strength and weakness of stones at all times. And above all, try not to have more than 1 weak group on the board at a time!]
