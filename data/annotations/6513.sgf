C[Hello!

Thanks for reviewing this game!

 I hope you can give me some general advices about the direction of play and some tactical & strategical improvements.

 Greetings, Nikolai];B[cd];W[pp];B[dp]C[kaktus [5k\]: hi
kaktus [5k\]: hf];W[od];B[ed];W[cj]C[Imagist: Good, this is necessary to prevent black from building too large a moyo.]
;B[ch]TR[cl]C[Imagist: This is okay, but the triangled points are equivalent, so it isn't urgent for either player to play in this area.  It's probably better to play one of the other big points on the board and play on the left when one move has a clearer advantage over the other.]
;W[cn];B[fp]
(;W[en]C[Is this move all right?  or maybe better b4? or e10?

Imagist: I can't say for sure that this is bad, but I personally would prefer B4 (see variation).]
;B[dj]LB[cl:A][nq:B]TR[ej][gn][co][bp]C[this looks a little agressive...

Imagist: White has a weak point at A, and by attaching here, black is fixing white's weakness.  Generally it's best to avoid attaching to weak stones.

Locally, black could attack with any of the triangled points or even by playing A directly, but the best choice would depend on the full board position.  Since the position isn't clear, I would say that it is best to tenuki.  My choice in this case would be B.]
;W[dk];B[ej];W[bk]LB[cl:A]TR[bi][ci]C[how was my reaction?

Imagist: This is good I think.  It leaves a slight weakness at A, but a good followup at one of the marked points, as well as good eyeshape, so I think white is doing fine here.]
;B[pn]LB[pf:A]C[Imagist: This approach is generally used when black has a strong position around A, and wants to build a moyo.  Other than this it generally isn't very good because it doesn't threaten the corner very severely.]

(;W[hq]LB[np:A]C[should I better respond to q6?

Imagist: This is probably okay, but it can get complicated if black tries to fight for sente in order to move first on the bottom right.  A takes clearer advantage of black's high approach (see variation).]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[gq];W[ho];B[gp];W[np]LB[iq:A]TR[pn]C[ i was not really satified with this outcome...looks like a huge weakness around L4.

Imagist: Black should protect the marked stone after this, though, so white can protect at A.]
;B[ek]C[Imagist: Better to force from the other side at B5, since black already spent 5 moves protecting the corner.]
;W[cq]LB[dl:A]C[Imagist: Good, A would be too docile.]
(;B[dl]C[Imagist: Can't do this, black's corner stones are in danger.  See variation.]
;W[cp]TR[dp][fp][gp][hp][gq]C[Imagist: Good, now black's 5 stones are under attack.]
;B[fn];W[em];B[ck];W[eo]LB[iq:A]C[Imagist: Connecting at A is better - make profit and take away forcing moves at the same time.]
;B[dq]LB[iq:A]C[Imagist: Black can't make enough eyespace to live here, so what's the point.  Better to get out of danger and capture a stone at A.]
;W[hn]LB[iq:A]C[Imagist: A still better.];B[gn];W[jq]LB[bl:B]
[hr:A]TR[dj][ej][ck][ek][dl]C[now it is stronger - but what do you think about the left side?

Imagist: This still leaves black A, a forcing move that might be useful for getting eyespace later.

The left is okay.  The five triangled stones are overconcentrated and white has a big sente endgame move with B for later.]
;B[fl]LB[gl:B][fm:A]C[Imagist: White can still split with A - better to get out by jumping at B.]
;W[pk]C[seems like a good timing

Imagist: Fine with me. :)];B[nn];W[lo]LB[qo:A]C[still wanted to protect... necessary?

Imagist: I think it would be better to protect the corner and remove black's eyespace at A.  Black is too weak locally to take advantage of white's weak spot.]
;B[qk];W[qj];B[ql];W[pj]LB[qo:A]C[Imagist: Here white A would be nice, wouldn't it!]
;B[pe]LB[qd:A][pf:B]C[Imagist: This isn't much good - it doesn't threaten the corner very much and it can't escape very easily.  A or B would be better.]

(;W[pd]C[Imagist: This leaves black with forcing moves (see variation).]
;B[qe];W[qd];B[qh];W[oh]TR[pe]C[i was happy with it until here! justified? ^^

Imagist: White is still ahead, but could take better advantage of black's marked play.]
;B[oe];W[om]LB[ne:B][qq:A]C[Imagist: This is bad for two reasons.  First, it strengthens black, making the threat of black A more real.  Second, the hane at B is urgent (huge!).]
;B[pb]C[Imagist: !!!];W[ob]C[Imagist: Better to attack black on the side, and just let this stone die on its own.]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[nd];W[nc]TR[pb]C[blacks play seemed again too aggressive to me...

Imagist: The triangled stone is definitely too aggressive, but the two hanes are good shape.]
;B[on];W[qo]C[Imagist: Still very big.];B[re];W[md];B[ne]
(;W[gc]C[whi felt like a big mistake. i should have attaked the lowe group in order to solidify my weks middle group...

Imagist: I agree.];B[nm];W[ol];B[ln];W[ko]LB[kn:A]C[Imagist: White is solid here: put more pressure with the hane at A.]
;B[ll]C[saved - and white has to watch out now

Imagist: Yes.]
(;W[mk]LB[lk:A]C[Imagist: This loses initiative - better to attach at A I think (my reading may not be perfect here).]
;B[ic]LB[me:A]C[black totally took over initiative - and white managed to place another weak stone on g17. this one only brouht trouble. turned the game

Imagist: Black isn't quite strong enough on the right to pull this off, but he does have a lot of thickness.  Still, I would try A instead.]
;W[lk];B[lc];W[mc];B[ie];W[kl]C[black ignores to oftern, so white can attack again]

;B[mp];W[mo];B[no];W[nq];B[qn]
(;W[ro]LB[rk:A]C[Imagist: Don't respond just because black played on this side.  The hane at A leaves black without enough eyespace.]
;B[rj];W[ri];B[sj];W[si];B[rl];W[qi];B[rn];W[sm];B[sn];W[sk]
;B[rk]
(;W[mf]LB[lf:A]C[now i have to go on the other weak black goup. how to attack best?

Imagist: When trying to surround a group, moves farther away from the group are better.  Here, A would work much better.]

Imagist: My overall comment is that black's reading seems better than white's.  However, black left a lot of weak groups on the board, while white seemed to keep more solid groups.  If white kept better shape, black would have had a much harder time.]
