Comments marked "al>"

al> Thanks for giving me the opportunity to train my reviewing skills :)
al> In general, I get the feeling that both players make some moves without actually having decided what the purpose of the move is, for real. Of course, this comes with experience (and I have been known to make goofy moves myself) and evaluating what the board may look like, twenty or fifty moves later. Leaving situations too early, providing obvious weaknesses without compensating the potential loss by the alternate move, also happens more than a few times in this game.
al> I believe that it is not too important to analyze this game too much, apart from the first fifty moves or so, because what happens after that is often a consequence of less optimal moves at the start. So, just keep playing, and it will get better!]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[cp];W[qc];B[ep]C[al> It is always interesting to fast forward 20 or 50 moves or so, and see how the position developed during the game. I would say that black did not utillize the e4 stone in a way that defends placing it there instead of at E3.]
;W[qn];B[jq];W[rp];B[dj]C[al> The q4 stone is a little lonely now, so white can lean on it to outline a good chunk of territory around the lower right corner and side. I believe R3 would be a better move than D10, which seems a line too high and a little to far from the corner stones to really connect. Even D9 feels better, as it does not leave an obvious mid point for white to play at.]
;W[oo];B[nq];W[qq];B[pq];W[pk];B[jc]C[al> Again, I believe black leaves too early. N4, perhaps, or M4 would make it less easy for white to attack the bottom in order to gain influence in the center.]
;W[ce];B[nc]C[al> Four point extensions always leave a nice mid point for the opponent to play at. OR, as in move #30, play inside the group.]
;W[ch];B[ci]C[al> If D10 had been att C10, then D7 would have made a nice anwer to WC12. NOw it is too much open space between black's groups.]
;W[dh];B[qe]C[al> I think black leaves too early again.White has potential territory in the lower right and top left corners, while black has almost nothing. C7 is one move that comes to mind. Also, R15 pushes white towards the black stones at the top, separating the black stones. I would have felt more comfortable with playing G17 to try to outline territory along the top. There is too much gap between the white R17 stone and the Q9 stone for white to cover it with one move, so there will still be open for reduction.]
;W[pd];B[qh];W[qj];B[oh];W[pe];B[qf];W[ne];B[je]C[al> Because of the three point extension, the O4 stone is vulnerable, and N16 would have been a more natural move, I think.]

;W[lp];B[kp];W[gq];B[rj]C[[black\]: trying to reduce white's right territory

al> As white has just invaded the bottom, it seems like the wrong priority. If E4 had been at E3, then the lower left corner would have been safer. Now it is still wide open, and white peeks into it. F3 is called for here, I think. Also, the reduction turned out to be the opposite - S11 would have reduced more.]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[rk];B[si];W[sj];B[sh];W[go];B[hp]C[[black\]: attacking white's group

al> The attack feels like it comes from the wrong direction. This will push white towards the open spaces in the corner and along the left side.]
;W[gp];B[hq];W[er];B[mh]C[al> The lower left side and corner are black's last chances of making larger territory. What was the reason to play N12?]
;W[en];B[dn];W[do];B[co];W[cn];B[dm];W[np];B[oq];W[eo];B[dp]
;W[bn];B[dr];W[eq];B[bo]C[al> I fail to see the purpose of B5. D3 seems more urgent.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[lr];B[ms];W[kq];B[kr];W[jr];B[lq]
;W[ls];B[ks];W[em];B[dl];W[le];B[ke];W[lg];B[mk]C[al> N9 at O9 would look better as the shape would be less open for attack.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[fq]C[[black\]: trying to separate white's stones

al> A move at Q5 would have better chances of separating white's stones.]

;W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[ol];W[on];B[pl];W[pr]C[al> white must defend the S9 stone, and the group. The black group at the bottom is safe, so black can now capture the white Q10 group by playing S8.]
;B[or];W[rl]C[al> R8 is the critical point and black can still kill white's group by playing R8, followed by S7 unless white gives up the five stones.]

;B[ir];W[lj];B[lk];W[ok];B[nk];W[ib];B[jb];W[ie];B[fh]C[[black\]: I didn't realize that h16 will save my two stones while reducing white's territory and played f12 trying hopelessly save my stones

al> H16 would not save the two black stones as far as I can analyze. One variant added. However, there could be some way that black can make life there, by shooting at the gaps, as there is some space.]
;W[hd]C[[black\]: I missed that spot. such a shame...
[black\]: The very beginning of black's defeat!!!];B[qm];W[ja]
;B[ka];W[ei];B[dg]C[[black\]: suicidal act];W[rm]C[[black\]: If Ihad B d13 here, I could capute W s8 and s9 too.

al> yes, so black should think about what the purpose of playing D13 was. Since white is not forced to answer there, black is just giving away points.]

al> As there is nothing that prevents white from connecting at S6, the liberty does not matter.]
