C[BW- playing as white, I think my major problem was an early invasion. I'm hoping for advice on other glaring mistakes, and game changing moves that I missed.

BW- I also feel like my end game was very passive, but I didn't see any weaknesses to expoit.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo];W[ci];B[kq];W[nc];B[pf]C[Okay Ben we are gonna look at this game and try to give you as much insite as possible on your movies and as many tips as I can think of that will help your game. :) 
First off lets start off with respoding to blacks movie at Q14 the golden rule is to never driectly touch a stone because when you do they have to respond by playing right back ontop of your stone and they get a lot stronger so indirect is better for example common joski is Q18.]

(;W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[qe]
(;W[ld]C[When you are this stong with the three stones you can play further away this seems a little to closed up]
;B[qj];W[ql]C[BW- I think this invasion was probably ill advised, There is an error by B later that I didn't notice that might have helped, but I missed it completely

Have to always be carefull about invasions like this black is really stong and it is hard to run out for example Black can just cap your stone here and the most White can hope for is small life while Black builds up a big wall on the outside]

(;B[pk];W[pl];B[ol];W[om];B[nm]C[BW- B makes a habit of building walls with single stones, I'm not sure, but it seems as though the standard is to use two stones before you hane. I think it's a proverb. Is there some way that one should take advantage of single stone hanes? 
Of a single stone hane yes by making a doudle hane 
Also the proverb is hane at the head of three stones]

;W[ro]
(;B[rp]C[BW- I think S4 was a mistake for B. I think R4 is the correct response and there are only 2 options for B, both leaving W alive at the end . . . I think. R4 was the right movie]

(;W[sn];B[rm];W[sl];B[rn];W[so];B[sp]C[BW- I *think* R4 would still be good for W here.]
;W[sm]C[I have the variation that shows what will happen next.]

(;B[sj];W[pn];B[po]C[BW- W is dead now?
Yes here White is dead];W[jq];B[jp];W[ip];B[jo];W[io];B[cq]
C[There is another variation where you could have tried to wall off a large section of territory I have it listed below]

(;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[bm];B[bl];W[cl];B[am]

(;W[cm];B[bk]C[BW- C9 is probably the better response]
(;W[bj];B[ck];W[dk];B[cj];W[dj];B[bi];W[bh];B[aj];W[ch]C[BW- I feel like this still did not work out too badly
It is just a few points worse then C9];B[in];W[hn];B[hm]C[BW- B continues his single stone hanes
Here the single hane is a strong movie since Black followed up but his follow up was not the best.]

C[BW- I think this was my best move in this instance
This was a great move that played out very well for White];B[fe]
;W[de];B[hf];W[ie];B[il];W[hk];B[hh]
(;W[ik]C[BW- Not sure if j10 is better than J9, I was thinking to connect to N8, and to keep H12 from connecting anywhere

I made a veriation for J10 it has a lot of possibility];B[jk]
;W[jj];B[kj]
(;W[kk];B[jl];W[lk]C[BW- Not sure that this was a good idea. too ambitious maybe.]
;B[lj];W[mj]C[BW- This too

This seemed like asking to much at this point you should not bee worrying about saving the two stones but trying to use them to reduce Blacks territory]

;W[gq];B[hs];W[hp];B[kr];W[fo];B[nf]C[BW- I feel like this is the start of the end game. I also feel like I play very passively/reactively from here on out.
From this move forward your basic Idea is to try and reduce while still keeping or gaining points its almost end game but not quit fully endgame]
