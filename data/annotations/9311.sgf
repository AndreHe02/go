C[Hi MeiTen,

I reviewed the game and I think I have talked about the main points.
At the main line there are 16 comments, which are important I think. Over the whole game there are many smaller mistakes like slow moves or small reading mistakes and I mentioned just a few and not all.
Hope my comments help you a bit!

For the next time you should also put some questions or comments on your own into the sgf file. Maybe I now missed an important situation, that was of interest for you!
If this is the case or you have some further questions or did not understand something, just write me an EMail!

Till now a good and normal opening.
For white it would be slightly better to have k16 on k17.
Already it is easy for black to get settled on top, since black can underplay the white stones on the third line.

I guess finally it is a matter of playing stile, but already white is not in balance, white more interested in influence.

For black something that strengthens c14 is more important than having k4. Maybe slide into the corner or extend on the left side down.]

j16 instead of j17 is a must!
Black attacks and should not just connect and see how white reacts. j17 is some kind of "I've no plan what to do".

What do we want?
- invade the top
- attack corner
- run into middle

j17 does already nothing of this points. j16 tries to escape into the middle.
Now white has 3 points he could think of (despite the fact that white always can play k18!):
- Blocking at j15
- Atari at k18 and extending to k15
- Blocking at g17

In my opinion wrong direction of both!

O11 for white is not really an attack. White cannot hope to get black in serious trouble, so r11 would be of more interest for white.
Also r11 and r10 are of more interest for black in making eyeroom.

[dl:C][en:1][gn:2]C[Comment 8:
h10 and g8 seems a bit randomly.

Better securing corners for black or attacking at p6.
Or directly attacking left side with something like b11.

White should be aware that he is too thin on the left!
Before 1 and 2  the abc sequence would be better for white!

All your last moves where too slow!
Whites moves are ok (a bit slow) but also blacks are slow and A instead of m3 is just a mistake! O3 needs a backup so B is too good to allow for white!

A is just a dame move, nothing worth, it does not attack, not secure, not gain points!
Instead of saving at m3 black could first attack at o5 maybe!]
;W[lr];B[jr]LB[os:A]C[Comment 11:
A (like in the game) is standard but a little bit uninspired!
Also m2 m4 are a bit thin! Black can break through! (See sequence at move 128)

First white could hope to strengthen his stones with l3 k3 and afterwards make a serious attack like q2 and not just a monkey!
