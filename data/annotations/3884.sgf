(;B[pd];W[pe];B[qe];W[od]C[this is a bad result for black.  top right corner needs another stone to be secured for black and r14 is a cutting point (it can be fixed but this will require a move)  but white has a nice wall to extend from.]

you definately have to make center influence.  it's hard to say the best time.  good go players (not me) would, at this stage, would have center influence as a result of setting it up as the game progressed from the beginning.  
however, in this case i think you could have done some throw-ins earlier in the center since now white is very strong in the center.]

I can't tell who's in the lead, especially with the possible invasion I was working on from the center, as well as any oppertunity I had from the top left.

Thanks for taking the time to review.

You're welcome.
Looks like the whole left side of white is dead.  black has to top corners and the right side minus a little white influence which is balanced by the bottom right black influence.  White has a little blob on the bottom and an undefended area up top.  Thus black is much ahead (maybe 40 points?).  I'll just kill some groups and check this estimate.]
