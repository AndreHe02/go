C[In the beginning there are some mistakes, but the really interesting part starts at move 68

xxc : hi
first of all, the basic of go game is life, it is important to take care of your stones and make them alive
then comes extentions, connections and liberties
one's also need to understand how "well" stones are connected and how to count liberties of a group
strategy, fight, sacrifices and all the other parts of the games comes after ... impossible to talk about opening strategy if you do not have a small idea about relationship between stones and why one space jump is "well" connected but slow, two spaces is "fast" and "nearly" connected and 3 spaces is "faster" but "loose" connected
high andicap games are also a good way to go up, do not be afraid of playing a lot of when starting, and perhaps you can also have a short review from white player at the end

so keep in mind life for your stones see first var]
(;B[pp]TR[pd]C[xxc : i'll point out possible moves for next turn

here R16 for white];W[ed];B[od];W[do]TR[qd]C[xxc : why not, but i think it is easier to learn from 4-4 before exploring other starting moves in the corner]
;B[em]TR[eq]C[xxc : remember ... each stone is important and should have a meaning

what is the effect of this one on the board ?
do not works well with other B stones
do not put presure on white corner];W[fo]TR[cm][hq]C[xxc : seems to high, space under white stones is still enough to offer B a good invasion spot]
;B[ho]TR[gn][gq];W[ei]TR[gm][hq];B[fi]C[xxc : here is what i may call "the fear of empty space" !
think it is a common wrong thinking when starting playing this game, when playing contact moves, you also play a stone with only 3 liberties ! and it is opponent can grab you one more ...]

what to keep in mind from this
starting from F11, B try is best to "kill" white stones, but without having a strong "base" to start from
the result is a disaster for B

(;W[ml];B[jn];W[kl];B[mn]C[xxc : big ko threats are needed before going on here
and the first who add a stone may have the bigger threat
see var

B have to spend one more stone to go on here and this means 2 W stones elsewhere

W may gon on with the game here]
(;W[ln];B[ll];W[mf]C[You can guess that I was nervous when I was forced to play this tenuki

xxc : see var];B[io]C[here black plays straight into my pocket. Without this move I think I only could have achieved life for my group, not captured the black group.

xxc : B start the ko];W[kl];B[gs];W[im]C[and then a sigh of relief]
;B[qm]C[xxc : fight, fight and fight again

try to stay away from them for a while
spend your stones to enlarge your territories and make your groups strongers

and when under attack, search for a place to defend whit peacefull moves, the result you will have is stronger groups to conterattack latter


i hope this will be usefull for you

thank you])

[jf:11][bj:8]C[xxc : here "two points" living groups with number of stones needed
go is a turn based game, it is important to keep in mind that each time you add a stone, your opponent have one ... having the same result with 3 less stones means you have 3 stones elsewhere on the board
this is the reason why  most of games starts from corners, then sides, then center

starting your games this way, and staying as simple as possible will let you spend energy to understand other parts of the game

C[xxc : an exemple of what can be played

most of groups comes from standard paterns with basic shapes
playing this way may help you to understand what may be usefull or useless ... and how much a group is strong or not

from here a battle for center may start ... a battle looking like the one played in this game :)

now, let's go with the game comment]))
