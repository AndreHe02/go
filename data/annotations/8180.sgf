AB[pd][dp]C[My cheifest questions are those of reduction. In the end I had a big bottom and right side. Could these have been reduced by an intrepid opponent and how could I have defended them?

/This is Robert, matbelfer on KGS. I will do my best to answer your questions. However, in this game there were more important issues which I am going to discuss.]
;W[pp]C[/You played better opening than your opponent and gained fair advantage at start. Neverthelessm, I think sometimes you should think more about connecting your groups and you'd come up with better moves (I will show the examples)]
;B[dd];W[pm];B[pj];W[dj]C[Riani [15k?\]: hi];B[nq];W[pq];B[cq]
C[You leave your black stone alone... Generally connecting and safety of groups should be the priority.]

(;B[ej]C[/This is unefficient way to defend this group. You'd better try to connect it with stones below (see variation)]

(;W[ne];B[pf];W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[le]
(;B[ke]C[/This move is small comparing to corner enclosures end moves connecting your position. Now think of such moves (I showed some examples in the variations)]

(;B[rj];W[rm]C[Riani [15k?\]: thx]
(;B[pn]C[/Strange move. Sometimes such unconventional moves work and turn out to be the spark of genius. However, I think here it was unreasonable and you could have regret this move. Another choice in variation.]

;W[fa]C[Eventually white decided to clarify the situation. Now let's have a look on neighbouring groups. D15 looks very bad now and is likely to die. Also K15 group isn't strong. White has to worry about M14 and O17 groups.]

Regarding your play here:

1. pay attention to ataris and be aware which groups are short of liberties! Very often capturing races, where two opposite groups struggle for life, are the most important places on the board. I think that after playing a lot of games you will improve in this area. I also recommend solving go problems, especially life & death.
2. Think more about connecting moves during openings and don't forget about corner enclosures (second moves in the same corner).
3. You have bad habit of contact play to single enemy stone invading your territory (moves 68,112), which is risky and often doesn't pay off.]
