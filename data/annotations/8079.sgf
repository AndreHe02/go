;B[qd]C[This game contains many strange moves, some merely weird and others seemingly placed at random because they allow so much damage to be done. My reaction at first was to be a little bit annoyed,  until a sense of humour resurfaced. 

Indeed, weird moves are one of the joys of Go. Still as your faithful reviewer I'll point out the craziest ones, especially those of the game-losing variety. (jantje)]
;W[dp]C[rarellano [5k\]: hi, have fun
Stone16 [5k\]: hi];B[pq];W[dd];B[od]LB[pk:a]C[With this shimari, a move at or near a becomes urgent. I daresay you knew that. But, perhaps, you failed to notice that this means PLAY THERE!! As soon as opportunity arises. (j)]
;W[dj];B[jp];W[jd];B[gd]LB[pk:a]C[Should be around a.
And even if B absolutely wants to play in the upper left, 9 is located in an awkward position because it cannot easily make a base. (j)]
;W[ed]C[Strange!];B[gg]C[Looks strange but a cut soes not seem to work yet (j)]
;W[he]C[The two-space jump is weak, so W hastens to make it stronger.
(j)];B[fe]LB[ge:a]C[rarellano : mistake here I think

Sure. Replying at a, not forgetting to thank your opponent, is the honte (proper move) (j)]
;W[ee]C[Strange play by both continues. (j)];B[eg]LB[ge:a]C[This is already a game-losing mistake. After warning sternly against strange moves, here I nevertheless propose the empty triangle at a. Bad shape breeds bad shape. (j)]
;W[ff]
(;B[gf]C[In fact it may be here that you lose your last chance, see var. (j)]
;W[ge];B[ef];W[fd]C[Game over. None of B's last 6 moves have helped him a bit, while W has been making some 25 points of territory. (j)]
;B[dl];W[dn];B[fl];W[fj];B[pj]C[Still a good move (j)];W[fg]
C[And incomprehensible play continues. (j)];B[fh];W[fe];B[ei]

Yes, of course he should have. By cutting B comes back in the game. (j)]
;B[ej];W[fi];B[eh];W[hh];B[cf]C[Big, but so is a move in the lower right. (j)]
;W[qo];B[qm];W[oo];B[np];W[rq];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[lp]C[Looks suspiciously like an overplay to me, because W is making too many groups in Black's sphere of influence (j)]

C[The last two B moves are a good example of aji-keshi (spoiling your own possibilities). In particular, there is no move at a anymore. (j)]
;B[nf];W[oh];B[mi]LB[mh:a]C[Attacking is a good idea, but now W can play in the direction of his own strength. Therefore a is better. (j)]
