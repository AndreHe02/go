C[Ginno: Hi dear reviewer, I'ts been a fighting game and I'd like to have comments to understand better direction of play in the early & middle game & how I could have handled fights. thanks for your advices!

krv: This game was hard to understand. Really In many cases I'm not sure which way was better. May be you should ask anybody stronger. Anyway I made some notices.]

C[Is L16 more important?

krv: H17 or L16 look about equal. May be L16 bit better];B[kd]
;W[ke];B[je]C[krv: feels like L16 is stable, M16 is stable too, you can't create much territory in center. Thus K14 pushing it to left destroys your terrytory at  H17. May be tenuki is better. P3 for example

But Zenith (computer program) likes your way ;-)];W[jf];B[ie]
;W[if];B[he];W[hf];B[gc];W[gb]C[Here I guess I should have played less defensively, like g16?

krv: looks like g16 works fine.];B[fc];W[fb];B[ec];W[eb];B[dc]
;W[db];B[bc];W[cb];B[dd]C[What should I do now? I wanted to help somehow the weakness of L15

krv: K14 looks stable itself (flying to center for example) thus cutting near L15 isn't very big. P4 looks fine.
but you can play P14 in sente, if you want to protect this cut.]
;W[oi];B[kf];W[le];B[kg];W[mg]C[krv: looks like you are chasing L13 while your J14 can die in 1 move.]
;B[gf];W[qg]C[4th line better i guess...

krv: looks like now you should try to escape with J12 or near. Other way black center is very big. You need to be strongly sure that R13 or Q13 is sente, may be J13 is more accurate.]
;B[pg];W[qh]C[krv: Q12 is usual. Other way N16 goes weak];B[ph]
;W[ri];B[qj];W[rj];B[pi];W[qf];B[pf];W[qk];B[pk];W[ql]C[krv: usual getting 4-th line is important. now Q8 looks better]

;B[lk]
(;W[jl]C[krv: looks like M9 almost connected with Q11. Thus K8 isn't very important - K14 isn't more important cutting stone and you can sacrifice it. O8 chases from other side. with O8 you are also chasing Q10.]
;B[mi];W[rb];B[oh];W[qm]C[krv: R8 is stable and you can move at R6.]
;B[jp];W[oq];B[pq];W[op];B[po];W[lq];B[fq];W[cn];B[fp];W[ck]
C[krv: you get this first and thus you could expect grab little more than your opponent ) E10 looks better.]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[I wanted to take outside influence out of the sequence (somehow harm f3 or something else) But It proved to be useless & even harmful. I should rather let b live with c4 and then what? k2?or something in the center?

krv: your way is fine. You are already behind thus can't pretend very much]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[fr];W[es]C[krv: now cutting isn't a need right now. You can play at O7 for example. We can imagine that in the future Q10 could have only one eye (while capturing P10)]
;B[bo];W[bn];B[co];W[do];B[cp];W[em]C[krv: you need to protect, but F6 also chases black bottom.]
;B[kq];W[lp];B[kn];W[ko]C[krv: look aji keshi. I'm not sure, may be K5 will be good too - now or later.]
