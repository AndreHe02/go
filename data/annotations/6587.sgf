AB[pd][dp]C[This is a two-stone handicap game and I played white. Even though
I won (just) and a fairly quiet game, there were many difficult
choices about the biggest areas to play and deciding if a sequence
was going to be sente or not. Appreciate comments about my and
my opponent's judgments.];W[dd];B[pp];W[qn];B[ql];W[nq]
(;B[np]C[This move is usually seen as a mistake by black.]

(;B[oq];W[oo];B[nr];W[mq];B[pq];W[no];B[qo];W[pn]C[I thought it right to spend another move to confine black in
the corner. Was it??

yes, it's one of the things you can actually get done with this "joseki" (I wouldn't call it even though) The down sides to this is the ladder aji, which black takes advantage of.]
;B[cf];W[mp]C[C14 is a big move black gets for free];B[mr];W[lr]
C[Could I have got N2 earlier at any time with sente?? 




No black would not have responded to N2, or shouldnt' have to.]
;B[ro];W[rn]C[again spending a move to confine. Now how should I use that thickness?
When should I attack R8??];B[fc];W[ee];B[cd]C[I'd ignore here, treat those stones as light, and try to attack R8, you are behind now and if R8 gets off easy then all of black's groups will pretty much be strong.]

f17 or to extend on lower side or to play on the right??


This is definently more active than pincering F17, if you pincer F17 it would be likely that black would try to counter pincer in some fashion.]

(;B[ke];W[kd];B[je];W[ld];B[pj]C[So he stopped the invasion on the right but took gote to do it
so I now have time to take territory somewhere lse. Again is
H3 area bigger?   H3 area is big, after white extends there the push and cut at D6 becomes very big, but to treaten the cut white must extend all the way to F3.]

(;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[ff]C[Maybe I should have captured F15 at some time earlier because
he can now build moyo in middle. However I can get compensation
elsewhere as game. What do you think??];W[df];B[fg];W[cg];B[dg]
;W[ce];B[bf];W[be];B[bg];W[hq];B[iq]C[I think he could build moyo in center instead?? moves like L10
perhaps?? Should I instead have been playing in the center to
reduce him??   



Reducing him directly sould be ideal, but it's also hard for black to play a move that makes it hard for the N4 influence to not get in a bit.]

with K5 in combination with a cut at c2 and e2. was I lucky here.
