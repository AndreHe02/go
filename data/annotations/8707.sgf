Hi Kyle,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review your game.  I have gone through it and added comments as I've seen them, and I have then come back and added some more comments with hindsight.  As always remember I am just an amateur and so please treat anything I say with caution.  I will prefix all comments in the first round with -- and all comments in the second round with ** so you can see if the comments are my initial reaction or have the benefit of hindsight.

Regards,
Corrin

Overall I think you both played well and there were a few moves by both you and your opponent which I disagree with.  I think you got yourself into trouble on the right side unnecessarily and some of the moves you played to try and get out of trouble didn't quite work.]

Whenever I play an opponent who starts an unusual fuseki, I change my play to be much more relaxed and wait to see what my opponent's plan is.  Usually I find that my opponent will overplay and I can punish them.  That said, this does feel like a slightly modified chinese fuseki - with increased emphasis on the upper left corner and therefore taking the lower left seems best]
;B[pk]C[--
This seems fine.  Taking the lower left would also be fine I think]
;W[nc]C[--
This move is consistant with white's plan];B[pf]C[--
Sure - no need to play unusually yet];W[jd]C[-- 
White's shape seems a little tight, but not directly punishable.  I would move to D4 next]
;B[dc]C[--
This seems ok but is perhaps a little premature - I would have taken the lower left corner instead - white cannot surround the upper left in one stone so you can still invade]
;W[ce]C[-- 
White offers the taisha. Since white already had K16 I would decline and settle in the corner - probably with F17.]
;B[de];W[df]C[--
I wonder why white didn't D16?  Anyway this seems ok for you]
;B[ee];W[cd];B[cc];W[fc];B[ec];W[dh]C[--
This is the move by either player which I really disagree with - it looks much too slow to me.

I guess from your perspective that's good - white has now played a very slow, solid move protecting the left and given you sente.  The left is now settled, and the top is also good shape with the F17 wall working well with K16 and O17 so I would start a new group - probably with D4.]
(;B[ff]C[--
I don't like this move.  Normally this move makes miai of C14 and an attack on F16 but here it does neither - white can either tenuki or strenthen the top.
**
This is where you fell behind, if you tenuki then white cannot kill you yet - though it is a bit painful running out.]
;W[qo];B[op]C[--
Of course this is fine, though I personally prefer R4 because it is easier]
;W[on]C[--
White is attempting to play lightly which makes sense - I would personally have chosen P7.]
(;B[pn]C[--
I've never been much of a fan of this sacrifice - I prefer R7
** 
I suspect that is personal taste rather than it being a mistake.]

(;B[nm]C[-- I don't like this move - see variations];W[ol]
(;B[ip]C[-- 
I think the result is ok, but not as good as it could have been.  My main concern is that Q9 is now quite weak.

**
How about adding a stone at perhaps P9?];W[ph]
(;B[qh]C[--
I'm not convinced by this - it makes Q9 very weak.
** how about P12 then crosscut?];W[qi]
(;B[qg];W[pj]
(;B[dp]C[-- 
Here I  disagree with your move.  While D4 is a great spot locally, I would have played R9 for sure.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[ep];B[cp];W[eq];B[eo];W[do];B[fo]C[** These last 5 moves are exactly where I would have played for both players]
;W[gq]
(;B[bn]C[--
I would play G4 or H4 - assuming I have read it right then it is ko for the corner.]
;W[iq];B[jq]C[-- this feels to me like a slight overplay];W[hp]
;B[ir]
(;W[io];B[hq];W[hr]
(;B[gp]C[-- I would have connected as black - it makes that shape very solid and white quite weak
** In hindsight, this is where the game started to go badly for you.  After white wins the ko you lose a lot of points on the lower side and G4/F5 is weak.  So you need a heap of points in compensation from the ko and I can't see that anywhere on the board]
;W[iq]C[-- There is no way you can win this ko so effectively you get two moves elsewhere.  Unfortunately that means the lower side is destroyed and I don't think you can get anywhere enough compensation anywhere to justify that]
;B[qk];W[jp];B[ok]C[-- These are the two moves I would have used but I don't think it is adequate compensation]
;W[nl]
(;B[cl]C[-- From a shape perspective I would hesitate about this move as I'd worry about B7 later.
** Globally I think continuing the ko threat makes more sense than getting an invasion into the left]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[lo]
(;B[ml];W[nk];B[mq]C[-- this is worth quite a lot of points but it doesn't feel too urgent.  O10 feels more urgent.]
(;W[rj]C[** Here is where things really start to go downhill - you don't really have any points - 10ish in the lower left, the same in the upper left, and the same again in the lower right.  You also don't have any big moyos.  So there's only two ways you can win here - either kill something or keep white small.  Killing seems unrealistic byt keeping white small seems possible - white doesn't have any big territories either yet.  However it doesn't look easy - white has C10 available and attacks on P9]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[mk];B[qj];W[pi];B[rk];W[rh];B[mj]C[-- This sequence all came from N3 - and now white has Q18.]
;W[ng]
(;B[ld]C[--
Surely this is an overplay!  Q16 is weak, and N10 is weak - I feel as soon as white gets the simple O15 you're in real trouble]
;W[ne];B[mc]
(;W[pc]C[-- I disagree with white's shape here, it feels too loose, though I like the general idea]
;B[od];W[nd];B[oc];W[ob];B[pb];W[mb];B[qc]C[-- Ok, that didn't go too badly though I still think M16 was bad.  Now your corner is safe but white's whole group is also safe so N10 is in a little danger.  Also I start to get quite worried about the size of white's moyo at the top.]

;W[ig]C[-- Perhaps a touch greedy by white];B[kf];W[ke];B[if]
;W[jf]C[-- white gives up on J13 somewhat];B[ie]C[-- oh, wow... Does this really work? It doesn't look like it!  I agree you have to do something because the game is looking hard, but I wouldn't have picked this.

;W[ii];B[ij];W[hh];B[hk];W[gi]C[-- To me the game is over now.  The top is huge in white's favour and white will gain by chasing J10, I would be very surprised to see you win from here]
;B[il];W[dl];B[dk];W[cm];B[el]C[-- a risky plan, white can kill the corner if I read it correctly.]
;W[em]C[-- I'm not sure why white wants ko - perhaps white thinks D7, C6 and you have to protect against white B5?]
;B[fm];W[ek];B[dm];W[jh]C[-- ah, white thinks your weak group provides enough ko threats]

;B[en]C[-- Wow.  Capturing the ko is huge but giving up the corner is very big too - it's almost 1/4 of the board on its own.
** Ok, this move effectively declares the start of yose.  You're behind for sure but it might be possible to catch up or at least come close]
