C[[EV\] Hello, this is your reviewer.  This was a fairly calm game, with both sides taking territory and avoiding dangerous fights for the most part.  There were no big mistakes, so let's see if we can find a few places where either side could be a little more efficient or forceful.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[cd];B[oq];W[nc];B[pf];W[ic];B[qj];W[jq]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[ck];W[ci];B[ed]C[[EV\] Good move, preventing W from making a perfect framework.  W has played wide extensions, deliberately inviting this invasion, so he must hope to profit by attacking.  So far the game looks even.]
;W[cf];B[cc];W[bc];B[dc];W[bb];B[gc];W[kd]C[[EV\] Let's pause to evaluate.  It is hard to actually count the score at this stage, but we can look at shape and efficiency.  Both sides look fine, with no wasted or out-of-place moves.  The B group in the upper left is a little weak, but should not get into too much trouble, and B has right side potential as compensation.]
;B[ib]LB[pb:A][lq:B]C[Was this correct?

[EV\] This move is a good way to secure the B group, but it loses points and ends in gote.  I think I would secure the upper right corner at A or make the first move on the bottom at B instead.  It does not look like W has a severe attack here.]
;W[hb];B[hc];W[jb];B[id];W[jc];B[gb];W[ia];B[he]
(;W[pb]C[[EV\] W could go all the way to R17 to take the corner.  Splitting W is not an attractive option for B in this position, as the resulting wall will be useless, so the joseki shown in the variation is likely.  Still, sente is valuable now, so this move is also reasonable.  Maybe best is to play directly on the bottom, leaving both options open here.  W will not be too unhappy if B gets the first move in this corner, as the group to the left is too strong to be affected.]
;B[qc];W[mq];B[oj]LB[no:A][gp:B]C[[EV\] This move looks a little inefficient to me -- there is not much potential territory above, and the moyo below is still quite open.  I prefer either of the marked moves, A to expand the moyo (even though W has a good response at P10 where B just played) or B to break up the W lower side.]
;W[rp];B[rq]C[[EV\] B could consider blocking on the outside, letting W live in the corner, in order to make a nice moyo and keep sente.  I think I prefer that option, but it is probably just a matter of taste.]
;W[qo];B[ro]C[[EV\] This seems too easy on W.  Better I think to just play Q4 and let W struggle to live or escape.]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[rn];B[sp];W[po]C[Just R7 instead of O4?

[EV\] This W move is a little heavy and slow.  W has already broken up the B side, even if B captures another stone or two, so running out fast and light with something like P6 or O5 or Q7 seems appropriate.  

[EV\] O4 looks like a necessary B response after W connects.  B wants to attack the entire W group.  There is no hurry to peep at R7, since W cannot make two eyes by playing there first.  In fact, B can cut at R6 to make a lot of territory (P10 breaks the ladder), so peeping now is aji-keshi.]
;B[np];W[mp]C[[EV\] Very bad, wrong direction.  Taking care of the weak W group is much more important than making a few points on the bottom.]

(;B[no]C[[EV\] Could B attack strongly at the vital point P6? See variation for a few moves of the possible continuation.]
;W[om];B[qm]C[[EV\] Good timing, now that B can no longer cut.]
;W[qn];B[pm]C[[EV\] But keep this move in reserve.  The exchange helps W run out, and W has no way to make shape here if ithis move is omitted.]
;W[on];B[mo];W[mm];B[nl]C[[EV\] Aji-keshi, helps W more than B.  Moves like this are OK if they make profit while attacking, but here the B shape above the weak W group is thin, and this stone will be poorly placed once W escapes.]
;W[mn];B[lo];W[kp];B[ko];W[ml];B[lp]C[[EV\] J4 or G4 is better style if B wants to press W low.  G3 or H3 is worth considering if B likes fighting.]
;W[lq];B[jp];W[iq];B[kq];W[kr];B[mk]C[[EV\] Too direct.  Avoid contact plays normally when attacking, as they tend to strenghten both sides, which is not what the attacking side wants.  Simply N10 looks better.]
;W[lk];B[mj];W[kl];B[lj];W[kj];B[ki];W[jj];B[md];W[mc];B[le]
C[[EV\] This move does not make much more territory than B already earned here.  I prefer G4 or (with hindsight) B11.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[ld];B[me];W[bl]C[Should I have defended here before?

[EV\] B11 would have been nice at some point, but  B should still be OK here.]
;B[cl];W[bm];B[bk]C[Would C7 have been better?

[EV\] B9 or B6 are fine, since W cannot cut in either case.  Hard to choose.  D11 might be good timing, since W answers are constrained while B still has both B9 and B6 miai.]
;W[bn];B[bi];W[bh];B[cm];W[ho];B[eo];W[fp];B[ep];W[eq];B[fo]
;W[go];B[gn];W[fl];B[fm];W[el];B[co];W[bo];B[gl];W[gk];B[hl]
C[[EV\] B could fight back more strongly with a double-hane or even a cut.  Try reading out some variations and see if you agree.  Note that B has D11 sente if needed.]

C[[EV\] Last of the large endgame points.  W is slightly ahead now.

[EV\] Looking at the result on the lower left quadrant of the board, B got little or nothing from his running attack on the W group starting in the lower right.  B made maybe 20 extra points around M13, but W solidified a similar territory around G2.  I suggest attacking a little less directly and looking for other opportunities during pauses in the attack.]

;B[sj]C[Would ko have been better for me?

[EV\] It looks like B is a few points behind, and B does have a lot of ko threats, so yes ko would have been a good final try for a win.  No further comments.]
