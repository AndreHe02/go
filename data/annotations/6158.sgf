C[Hello, my name is Bernd Sambale. I played this game as Vision, 3k, on KGS. My opponent was yet without ranking, so I can't say anything about his strength.

In the end this game was decided by a kill, which forced my opponent to resign, but before it seemed to be very close, and there was a lot of complicated fighting going on. I'd really like you, dear reviewer, to take a look at it and show me all the secrets my kyuish reading was not able to uncover.

Thank you very much!

Hi Bernd, though I am not very strong, I will do my best to point out some things.

I have made some comments throughout and also added some short variations on some moves.  Please let me know any questions about my comments or variations.

-Michaeljohn Clement];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[oc];W[qj];B[qh]
;W[qm];B[qo];W[nq]C[Here, the b corner is small, the bottom side is big.  So P3 seems to help w more than it helps b.

I would consider something like Q7, O4, P6, M4 or M3.]
(;B[oq]LB[lp:B][oq:A];W[np]C[I don't think I will tenuki here...  I might play O2 to close the corner, or Q7 or similar to get out.

If you do play on the bottom side I would think about L4 or M3 area... something a little more severe.  The problem is that w will be happy to play some forcing moves around the corner and seal in with a play around P6 in this case.  So this position, I think, shows why P3 is a mistake.]
;B[iq];W[qq]
(;B[or]LB[nr:B][or:A]C[O2 maybe a better response here?  See var.]
;W[nr];B[pm];W[rn]C[Again here, I think you overvalued killing R3.  R3 stone is not that important.  See variation at R6 for an alternative possibility.]

(;B[ro]LB[qn:B][ro:A];W[pl];B[om];W[kq];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq]
C[Top side now seems the biggest point, why not play around F17 or K16 area?

W group on the right side is weak, so maybe some attack from the outside first is better.]
;B[rl]C[...but this attack from inside w group seems premature.  You take away w eyespace, but w had no territory here anyway.  W will get strength on the outside facing the center which is worth more over the rest of the game than the 6-8 points you may take away here.]
;W[ql];B[rj];W[ri];B[rk];W[qi];B[rm];W[qn];B[sn];W[ph];B[pn]
;W[qg]C[Good result for w, the usefulness of the shimari is a lot less.  So b took away more points from himself than from w with the S8 sequence.]
;B[ko];W[jr];B[ir];W[lr];B[ci]C[The top side also seems better here than the left side because it can also be regarded as an extension from the b corner.  This group can only be expected to get about 10 points, the top could be good territory for whoever plays there first.]
;W[cf];B[cl];W[cr];B[fo]C[F5 seems a little small.  Top side is bigger.  B already put a quite a lot of stones on the bottom side group, and w corner is very solid now after C2, so this move will not help build any attack on w nor defend any great weakness of b group...]
;W[jc];B[dc];W[cc];B[ed];W[ec]C[D15 seems to be reasonable here, b can afford the ko in my opinion.]
;B[fc];W[db];B[eb];W[ee]C[Here b should certainly take the ko...  This costs nothing right?  Worst that can happen is w is forced to waste one ko threat.  Then after answering a ko threat you can always play F16 on the next time if you choose...

If w plays F16 simply connect and then w cannot fix so much weakness in one move.

You should really look at this move seriously because the ko should be your first instinct always.]

(;B[fd]LB[dc:B][fd:A];W[fb];B[gb]C[Why not take the ko here??  Again you can lose nothing by taking the ko.  I think you have some "ko fear" which is a kyu disease. :-)]
;W[ea];B[fe];W[mc];B[ef];W[de];B[fh];W[mm];B[km];W[en];B[fn]
;W[jp];B[io]C[This shape is a little thin.  Maybe J6 is a little better, or N6.]
;W[qc];B[pd];W[rd];B[re];W[pb];B[ob];W[rc];B[qf];W[rb]C[W is alive here but there is some aji, for example, Q17 is sente for both, might be worth playing eventually depending on what happens.  So probably best to tenuki and leave the aji.

P8 is also sente and was sente for a while so maybe is worth playing at this time.

Something like M18 maybe not unreasonable, although the weakness at G17 (because you did not play the ko earlier) makes this less attractive.  Maybe H17 here, or a direct attack from the top of the w group around L16.]
;B[qa];W[pa];B[sd];W[ra]C[Now the aji is gone.];B[ok]C[The more solid P8 here is better shape and also sente.]
;W[pj];B[em]C[This is very big, but w has three groups all a little weak.  Also, the b group at R14 itself is not alive yet, so I think you need to make some attacks against w weak groups first, before taking some big gote moves.  There is still some important fighting, it is not yose yet.]
;W[ol];B[jj]C[This feels a little slow... I wonder if something around H17/L16 would be better, more direct, build territory by attacking, instead of this large but slow, gote move, the second one in a row.]
;W[oo];B[po];W[sm];B[sl];W[op];B[pq];W[hi]C[Fortunately for b, w responded to a slow move by panicking and making things worse with this overplay...]
;B[ih];W[hh];B[ig];W[hg];B[hf];W[jl];B[kl];W[jn]C[I will play K5 in this position.  It actually gives b better shape than the game line.]
;B[jm];W[kn];B[in];W[ip];B[hp];W[jo];B[im]C[J8 would be much more secure.]
;W[if];B[gf]C[H15 perhaps better.];W[ji];B[ii];W[ij]C[I would play L11 here.  It looks like none of this w should escape from the center.]
;B[hj];W[ik]C[I would play L11 here again.]
(;B[kh]LB[kh:A][ki:B];W[kj];B[hk];W[kg];B[jf];W[ie];B[kf]C[W should certainly cut!!  See var.]

(;W[ki]LB[me:B][ki:A]C[W is again ignoring the weakness of the R14 group.  N15 is much better.]
;B[lf];W[nd];B[nf];W[of]C[W plays some moves here that look a little desperate.]

;B[rq];W[lh];B[ib];W[mf];B[mg];W[me]C[N12 should be played immediately, it is double sente and an eye for b group!!  It also gives w very bad shape... really it is unquestionably the only move.]
;B[rf];W[jb];B[kd];W[mh];B[ng];W[jd]C[M16 seems fine here and makes life difficult for the w group.]
