C[I am white in this game

The game was played in the german "Bundesliga".
My Opponent is 3 dan
1h + 15 stones in 5 minutes time setting.

I am most interested bout the moves aroud move 40, as I have no clue about handling this Kind of position.]
;B[pd]C[bblunder4 [-\]: Klaus Petri 2D (w)-Thomas Derz 3d (s)]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[do];B[de];W[cg];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[gc];B[ef]
;W[cj]C[reid: Let's start by discussing these first six moves by white:  D17 declares white's intention to empasize the top edge.  Then white's second move (D5) declares that white wants to focus on the left side.

White's third move (C13) agrees with the second move, but then white's fourth move (C18) should be at C16.  C18 again puts white's emphasis on the top side, as does G17.  Now C10 is back to the left edge again.

White seems to want it all, which doesn't work very well in go.  Here, it is not reasonable to expect to be able to take both sides and keep the black stones weak.]
;B[hc]LB[ic:A]C[reid: but with this move, black is trying too hard.

Rmember this: "when you touch me, you help me".  Here, black plays in contact with the weak white stone.  The natural result should be that black helps the weak stones get stronger.  That's not what black wants in this area.

Better to keep his distance with A (J17) if black wants to pincer (which seems natural since white probably should have played C10 at K17).]
;W[hd];B[ic];W[fd];B[ge];W[gd]C[reid: when white plays the tiger's mouth (hanging connection) at F16, he can expect black to peep at G15.  So the question white must consider is: does G15 help black more or less than F16 helps white?  Or, if we compare this board position with the position if we remove G15 and F16, which position does white prefer?

It looks to me like white would be better off simply connecting at G16 instead of making the F16 tiger's mouth.]
;B[bb];W[id];B[kc];W[jd];B[kd];W[jc];B[jb];W[kb];B[lb];W[ib]
;B[ka];W[hb]C[I am not sure about the start: the Ponuki makes an interesting shape with the Q16 stone, but maybe Q16 should be at R16 now. (B is a litte overconcentrated+corner is not save jet.)
D18 might be a nice way to attack b later.
In the game I was unhappy but now I think it is ok.

reid: I have to agree with your game assessment: I think it's too early to take these two stones.  The two black stones are smaller than the one white stone (at L18).

White has played 12 stones here.  If he plays one more gote move at D18, he'll get 10 to twelve points here.

Looking at black's 13 stones plus one gote move at E18, he gets ten points in the corner plus however much he can get from the L16 stones.  Even without Q16 I would count the L16 group at about another ten points.  Black's stones are almost twice as efficient as white's.]
;B[pj]C[reid: black builds a formidable moyo!];W[nq];B[lq];W[qq]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo]LB[qn:A]C[reid: This is joseki of course, but in this game, white is already behind and he can't really afford to drift along.  Black is very happy with this result.  Perhaps white should try A instead of R3 - see variation.]

(;W[qf]C[reid: This is not a very good invasion point when black has Q10 in place (it's OK if black is at Q9 instead because then white can still extend comfortably to R11).]
;B[qd]LB[qe:A]C[reid: Oops, black is too gentle!  When black has Q10, the usual idea is to 'kick' the white stone with A (R15).  This is an exception to the "you touch me, you help me" rule.  See variation.]

(;W[ng]C[I thought this to be light, but it is just bad I guess.

reid: The meaning of 'light' is that you are prepared to give up parts of your group.  This move is somewhat light, but the subsequent play connected all your stones into a single heavy group.]
;B[pg]C[reid: black seems willing to settle for just the one R14 stone.  I'd say that's an offer white should seriously consider.

If I were black, I'd probably attack both stones together with a cap at M13.  I wouldn't expect to kill them, but black would gain overwhelming strength while securing a good amount of territory,  A sure-win formula.]
;W[qg]LB[ne:B][ph:A]C[reid: Hmm, white wants everything again :-)  It is not going to be easy to live with that powerful black wall at R16 and black stones already established at Q13, Q10, and towards the lower right corner.

To continue the 'light' theme of the previous move, white should consider moves like A or perhaps B.  White wants to force black to capture the R14 stone while he builds up some strength to combat the black stones already in this area.

But it's going to be an uphill battle no matter what.  Black has a large numerical superiority of forces in this area,]

(;B[qh]LB[ph:A]C[reid: If black wants to get more 'squirm' factor from this position, he should pull back to A.  Now white can't connect to O13 and he has no choice but to try to live along the edge.  Again, black builds massive thickness and secures territory in the process.]
;W[pf];B[ph];W[of]C[reid: White connects, so it's not great for black, but white is also very heavy, so he's not too happy either.]
;B[ne]LB[lg:A]C[reid: Ouch.  This is not an effective way for black to use his superiority here.  It is rarely a good idea to simply take territory in gote (unless we're talking about 20 or more points with a single move).  Here, black expands his corner territory by about 4 to six points in gote.

Again, better to cap at A and keep white struggling.  While white squirms, black gets free moves.  Gaining one point from a free (sente) move is much more effective than gaining 5 points with a gote move.]

(;W[lg]
(;B[nj]
(;W[lj];B[lh];W[mh];B[li];W[mi];B[mj];W[ki]C[b blundered here.

reid: Indeed!  With his last five moves (starting with O15) black has squandered the huge advantage he acquired.  He just let white back into the game.

Black would lose less if he played M12 at N12 to peep.  After white connects, black extends to M12 to cut off M10.  Or he could play M11 and N11 to cut off M10.

But really black should just keep white struggling by capping him with M13 instead of O15.  Black could expect white to help him solidify the right -side territory as he runs.]
;B[lk]
(;W[kj];B[kf];W[kh]C[reid: So now we can see that the white stone at L10 is a wasted move.  Better to just take two stones instead of L10.

(;W[ik]LB[hl:A][gn:B]C[maybe this is slack

reid: Well, it's pretty big.  But if black invades promptly, it's hard for white to hold onto the whole left side.  For example, black A or B takes a pretty big bite out.

Black doesn't have to worry too much about white D18: black B14 is almost sente thanks to the aji of D12.]
;B[hg];W[ho];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[re]C[From here on I had touble with my internert connection and as a result of this I had timetrouble. the game is getting rough. I dont know if it makes anny sense to comment the rest.

Thanks a lot for anny comments!

reid: OK, we've covered a lot of ground here.  Some important things to take away from this are:

1. Be consistant with your strategic goals - don't try to take everything.

2. Don't take small stuff too early - leave it for endgame.

3. When playing lightly, be prepared to sacrifice pieces of your groups.

On black's side:

1. Don't be so nice to your opponent!  Your job is to make your opponent miserable!  When you've got him on the ropes, keep him squirming!


Good luck, play strong!    reid];B[fb];W[ea];B[ec];W[fc];B[dd]

reid: This seems to grab more, but it's thin.  I prefer the other move.  But even more, I prefer capping white at M13 instead of O15.  By capping, black can expect white to help him take the right-side territory naturally (instead of taking it with another gote move like this).]

(;AE[qd];B[qe]C[reid: The kick.  White's usual answer is to extend]
;W[pf]LB[nd:A][oe:C][ph:B]C[reid: And then black normally jumps to A. Because of black Q10, white can only jump to B to start making eye-shape.  This is uncomfortable for white - the kick succeeds in making the white stones heavy.

Of course, in this game, black has stones at L16 already, So A (O16) is again too gentle.  Instead, black should attack with full force at C.  Now the white stones are really feeling the pressure!]

(;W[lj]C[Is this move better than the game? J16 is ultimately alive, so I thought I can go right in.
I dont understand this position.

reid: the position is difficult because black is ahead.  This move (M10) doesn't seem like it's going to cause any trouble for black.  He can simply solidify his moyo and be happy.]

;B[qf]LB[nb:B][ki:A]C[reid: After this, white probably reduces with a move around A.  Black B is sente any time (and black can probably ignore white B).

Black is still ahead, I think, but he was ahead before this started, so white can't expect miracles.]

In order to avoid this outcome, black probably wants to extend to R6 or Q6 instead of the pincer at M3.]
