RE[W+14]

AB[pd][pp][dp][dd][jj]C[Rex: Thank you for reviewing my game and helping  me out. I am playing Black, and am 12k on the  Dragon Go Server.]
;W[fq];B[jp];W[dn]C[R: See what you think of b and a couple of ways W might respond. One leads to W taking the corner with B building a wall for B to then take D10.  Either way you will separate some W stones.]

(;B[dj];W[eo];B[jd]C[Rex: I figured that I could give him the lower left  corner while I get good influence in all other parts of  the board. Is this in the correct direction?

R: I don't usually favor giving my opponent free gifts.  All the star points are located for outside influence.  So probably the underlying tactic worth thinking about is to run to the center and let W live in the corner.  The plan then is to use your outside wall to work well with your handicap stones.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nd]LB[nd:8][pf:A]C[Rex: I believe I should have played at A to more  strongly press him. See variation, pls.

R: either is ok.];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[ep]LB[ep:12][pj:A][qm:B]
C[Rex: Now it seems to me I've abandoned my  strategy. I saw I could most likely live here so  instead of remaining true to my strategy I changed. I  believe this is wrong. Right?   :-)   Would  somewhere around A or B been better?

R: It's usually better to stick with one strategy but then there is a saying that after each move it is a new game.  This is really meant to encourage us to reexamine the whole board after each move.

Living in the corner may be better than allowing W an easy time there.]
;W[fp];B[do];W[fn];B[cn];W[dm];B[cm];W[np];B[pn]LB[go:A][dl:B]
C[R: You could attack the W group on the left with A or B instead.  A particularly may limit W who should connect at F5 and make W over concentrated then you  can come back and play 20.]
;W[pq]C[R: Try the sequence from b.  It lets W start a wall to go with the wall at E/F but you have K4 to run out to the center with, so I wouldn't expect it to be a problem.  Taking the corner now settes your position.]

(;B[op];W[oq];B[mq];W[nq];B[qk];W[qp]C[R: See how W got the corner too easily.]
;B[qo];W[rp];B[ok]C[R: 30 doesn't do much.  You may have heard that a stone should do 4 things: 1 strengthen your group, 2 weaken your opponent's group, 3 extend your territory, 4 reduce your opponent's territory.  If it does all 4 it's a beautiful move, 3 pretty good, 2 may be fair, 1 need to study more, 0 are you sure this game is for you!  :)  30 may be only  extends your territory - no pressure on W, B group is already settled.  So how many things does W's move at a do?]
;W[lq];B[kq];W[lp];B[jn];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[hc]LB[hc:38][df:A]
C[Rex: Now I see that I should have moved at A. Sigh!

R: actually i think this is ok.  W has to work to build a position that's been squeezed by B.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cc];W[gf];B[er];W[lc];B[ld]
;W[kc]C[R: May be connecting at the peep is the strongest for B and keeps it simpler for B.  You stay connected and W has to live on the top - "let W live in a narrow space"]

(;B[mc];W[jc];B[id];W[hb]C[R: Given this line I prefer 'b' to 'a'. It can still get complicated.]

(;B[ib];W[ic];B[gb];W[hd]C[R: I think it was a mistake to let W connect two weak groups by taking H17.  If you are worried about W pushing through at 'a' look at my variations earlier.  W cant afford to let B escape into the center via G16 so B get's to live on the top.  That keeps some separation between W's stones (always a good idea).  This is altogether rather complicated and you may wonder how you could have avoided it - W will always try to make things complicated in a high handicap game.]

(;B[kd];W[gc];B[fb];W[jl];B[go]C[R: Good!];W[fo];B[gn];W[gm]
;B[hm];W[hl];B[gl];W[fm];B[il];W[hk]C[R: I think you have to patch the cut.]

(;B[ik];W[im]C[R: At least connect at b!]
(;B[in];W[hn];B[ho];W[jm];B[hq];W[fr]C[R: fight the ko!  You may not like them but we all need the practivce :).]

(;B[hr];W[hm];B[eq]C[R: I think this is kindof slow.  Though it does protect the corner.]
;W[nj];B[hj];W[gj];B[hi];W[gi];B[ig];W[pl];B[ql];W[pk]C[R: b reinforces this group so that it's harder for W to push you around here.]

(;B[mi];W[pj];B[ro];W[qm];B[rm]C[R: Let's see what you have...

The left hand side could be yours if you can guard against W:C13 in sente.  The group around J4 may be has 2 eyes.  The group at R5 is under attack and doesn't have 2 eyes yet.  The group around P17 extends to the center and is pretty safe.  So protecting the R5 group is urgent.

Meanwhile W has one corner, R14 is safe, F16-F6 group may be a good target.

But R5 could be in trouble.  R7 is pretty devastating.];W[pm]
C[R: does 'b' give you 2 eyes?]
(;B[dl];W[kn];B[ko];W[lo];B[kr];W[rc];B[qn];W[rj];B[rk];W[sl]

(;B[sp]C[Rex: I saw that I was probably dead so I tried this. Is  the variation possbile, and is it seki?]
;W[rr];B[sk]C[R: I think W should have played b to kill B unconditionally.]

(;W[sq];B[sn]C[R: So you got lucky to get life depend on a ko fight.  So I guess W tries to eliminate all the big ko threats against W...]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[cg]C[R: The B group is worth about 35-40 points so why not play b now that W has played a slow move at C13?]

(;B[ng];W[mj]C[R: T5!];B[li];W[on]C[R: T5!];B[kk];W[lm]C[R: T5! Am I missing something!]
;B[pg];W[qg];B[ph];W[so]C[Rex: The Geman 5k I played against said he thought  my biggest mistakes were not fighting the 2 kos in  this game, this being one of them. However, it  seems crazy for B to fight a ko against W in a  5-stone hanidcap game. It seems to me W would  kill B. Or am I wrong?

R: See!  There was no need but now you have to play the ko for life.    'a' isn't a ko threat - 'b' is one but neither of you have many big ones.]

(;B[ll]C[R: This isn't a ko threat.];W[sp]C[Rex: Opps. B should've played here.

R: You couldn't take the ko yet.];B[ml];W[oj];B[nm];W[pi];B[nn]

;W[lr];B[gp];W[rb]C[R: c or b reduce W's territory more IMHO.]

(;B[hg]C[Rex: I have sente on this move. What would've  been the largest move?]
;W[ga];B[ea];W[mb];B[nb];W[lb]C[R: the push is better at R12.]

b here is just to show how W can play a.]
