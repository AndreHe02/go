AB[dd][pd][dp][pp];W[jp]C[Please review for the black side.]
;B[gb]LB[pj:A][dj:B][jd:C][fq:D][gq:E][nq:F][mq:G][cn:H]C[I've been told that 2nd row moves are bad. What do you think?
When playing with the handicap stones you want to use the stoes to put pressure on white. Initially play "big" points which give you a moyo - as framework to use to subsequently fight white - put pressure on white.A, B and C are natural points to play at this stage.
D and F , E and G are possible but they are miai - if black plays F white can play D for example, and then you'll play  H - Gote.]
;W[hc];B[gc]C[I wanted to block this piece, but wasn't sure how. Is this an okay move?]
;W[gd];B[fc]LB[fd:A]C[The marked stone is poor shape - empty triangle - it's inefficient. why not play A - what is your fear?

Do not get pressed down. Go is about the race to get ahead - read Kageyama's book!]
;W[mp];B[np]LB[qq:A][cq:B][qj:C][dj:D][cn:E][gq:F][qn:G][pj:H]
C[I did a jump to try to prevent white from invading.
contact play make both sides stronger and instigates a fight. White can still invade - at A, B, C, D. E
Play F if you wish, but better is G, C or H];W[fq];B[go]LB[cn:A]
[dn:B]C[Another territory-saving attempt
Not really - first you have no firm territory to save, second your stone is floating - it's only very weakly connected to D4, 

Look at Kareyama's secrets of handicap Go.]
(;W[nq];B[mo]LB[oq:A][mq:B]C[your move does not threaten anything, so play A to make eye shape AND threaten B.]
;W[oq];B[op]C[Created a wall];W[pq];B[no]C[Stopped cut possibility]
;W[rq];B[hd]LB[qp:A][rp:B]C[Why?
your black group is wek and heavy, and white has just taken away your base.A or B better.]
;W[ic];B[ie]LB[he:A]C[Tried to position myself to cut through the white stones
Solid connection at A is better - counmt liberties you want to outnumber your opponent's liberties in a fight.]

[if:B][fp:C][rp:D]C[white is playing equally poor moves - hardly helpful.
28 is poor A, B or C are better. At this stage I'd look at C or D]
;B[ha];W[ia]LB[nc:A]C[what a pointless exchange - how many pooints of territory did you get for playning 30 at H19? A is much more use - any entension from white's wall is over concentrated.]
;B[hg]C[Created a cut preventing prevention];W[je];B[if];W[jf]

No you haven't he's got ample room to live  
A, B or C are the points to play];W[ne];B[jg]TR[pd]C[Poor - now your corner stome is weak. can you feel the strength of white's stones starting to threaten ther marked stone?]

A, B or C !!!!!];B[bj];W[qo]MA[mo][no][np][op][pp]C[why play 76 - what is the threat? now you've lost any base for the stomes marked X]

;W[lk]C[a lot of your play is difficulty to undedrstand - the small captures and contact play - you appear to think that capturing stones is important - it isn't. The treat of killing is. 

Learn life and death
learn what sente is - its a threat to kill or take territory or to separate.
