US[Brought to you by IGS]KM[0];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq]L[qp][oq]C[MG:  Notice the orientation of Black's komoku and his hoshi stones.  His hoshi exerts influence along the top and right, his komoku only along the right side.  This combination is about as good as it gets.


Consider playing the komoku at 'a' instead of Q3:  now its direction of play is along the bottom, and the stones don't reinforce each other as they did before.


Still, on rare occasions, you see a professional play at 'a' instead of Q3, but he always follows up at 'b'.  Note that the primary direction of play from an a-b shimari is along the right side, and the Black stones again reinforce each other (same idea, different implementation).

 ThomasJ 2k : I am.];W[dp]C[MG:  A rather common parallel fuseki, which has a section in Rin's _Basic Fuseki Dictionary_ (Japanese).

 ThomasJ 2k : At least I think, I am :-)];B[fq]L[po][pk][qk][dn]
[jp]C[MG:  Black missed the direction of play, which is on the right side.  In any case, making a

shimari is almost always larger than playing a kakari against a hoshi.  (Note:  A shimari and
a kakari against a _komoku_ are often equivalent.)


The book move is a shimari at 'a', although I might be tempted to play at 'b' or 'c' (Chinese
openings).


Still, F3 doesn't lose much.  If White is reasonable and responds with 'd', Black could build
the Mt-Fuji shape with 'e' (one of my favorite positions).


BTW, if one of the White stones had been played on komoku, playing a high kakari against it
would also be an option for Black.


ThomasJ:   The last move was actually used by Franz-Joseph Dickhut, german 6 dan,

in a tournament game against another high-dan player (I don't quite remember whom).

He quoted, that it had been used several times before, and actually made a long

and retailed description of this opening in the "Deutsche Go Zeitung", last issue.

There he furthermore made a reference to a game between two 7-dan professionals

from Korea, who had used this opening, and both players felt it as a normal opening

for both parts. Therefore I wanted to use it myself, to see, what would happen.]
;W[qo];B[qm];W[oo];B[np];W[lp]L[pl][qc]C[MG:  White's played an aggressive, but popular, variation.  Playing 'a' instead of M4 would have been quite good for White (White follows the usual joseki then invades at 'b').]
;B[no];W[pm];B[qk]L[ql][pl][qi][rl]C[MG:  The joseki has Black drawing back to 'a' instead.  I see two reasons:


(1)  The ikken tobi here is equivalent to crawling twice, since 'b' is sente for White.  If Black had played 'a' instead, he would have been able to hane if White had pushed at 'b'.

(2)  The ikken tobi has the weakness at 'c', which sets up a peep at 'd'.]
;W[nn];B[lo]L[mn][mo]C[MG:  Black usually plays at 'a'; the move Black chose allows White to wedge in at 'b' -- if Black loses a liberty, he could be in trouble.]
;W[jp];B[mn];W[pl]L[nm][qi][ql]C[MG:  This would be better shape at 'a', and it is aji keshi ('b' will be much less effective if Black answers at 'c' -- i.e., this is also aji keshi).]
;B[ql];W[qq];B[qr];W[pp];B[oq];W[oj];B[pi];W[jn];B[iq]L[dr][cq][dq]
[gn]C[MG:  Black should do something here, but this move is a bit weak.  Alternatives: 'a' though
'd'.  (Certainly you should slide first to 'a' if you intend to play J3.)


ThomasJ: I was a bit too fast playing around here. I am aware, that my last move was very bad (an unforced under-shoulder-move cannot be good. I made it to deprive white of his base and make a base for myself here, but still this move is bad.


MG:  The idea of giving your stones a base while depriving the enemy of his can't be faulted, but White's group is light and on the fourth and sixth lines, so White need not worry much about his stones right now.


ThomasJ:  From the mentioned alternatives to this move I would now rather play d, since this gives no connection possibilities to the white center group and gives the black group an escape route to the center.


MG:  The ogeima jump is really handy sometimes but, because of its loose connection to the other stones, you have to be ready to sacrifice something.  I've seen many players in similar situations try to maintain a connectivity that isn't there and end up losing big instead of giving up a stone or two.


ThomasJ:  Apart from that, the white corner may easily come under attack and may be surrounded if not answered or answered incorrectly.


MG:  Here's where studying a book on corner positions can show some profit (I have some, but in Japanese 8-).]
;W[jq];B[ip]C[MG:  Even now, a slide would be good.  White answered, making J3 kikashi, so Black can turn elsewhere.  This is a two- or three-point move in a life-and-death situation.]
;W[io]L[eq][er]C[MG:  I'd play 'a' or 'b' instead (these are _huge_), but this may be playable if White can make use of his thickness and keep Black in (if there were a White stone at 'c' I might play it myself).]
;B[ho]C[MG:  Slide now?];W[hn];B[go];W[mm];B[nm]L[rq][lm][op]C[MG:  'a' is bigger and the focus of life and death for these two groups (though neither will die in normal play).


Just play 'b' if you must play here, threatening a double atari.  The original atari is also aji keshi (if White extends in answer to 'b', then 'c' is worth a point in the endgame).]
;W[on];B[lm];W[ml];B[ko]C[MG:  Better to save this as a ko threat.  It's only worth a couple of points if White grabs it.  Of course, if you're about to launch a strong attack on the White group, this is the place to start. . . .]
;W[jo];B[ll]L[fc][dn][dr][gn]C[MG:  This is kikashi, but not useful right now.  White's two groups are already separated and Black is strong.  There are still _big_ points left on the board: 'a' to 'd', for example.]
;W[mk];B[lk];W[nd]C[MG:  White should have extended.  This gives Black a hane for free.]
;B[mj];W[nl];B[pf]C[MG:  Fine.  No need to get fancy.];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc]
;B[qb];W[kc];B[cf]C[MG:  This is just about the only interesting point on the board, especially since White seems to be working on a moyo.]
;W[di];B[ef]L[cc]C[MG:  This is quite OK, but with White's kind-of-weak stones at the bottom, you could probably invade at 'a' and reduce considerably any moyo White may get.  Just a thought.]
;W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[bi];W[gf];B[cn];W[dn];B[co];W[cp];B[dr]L[do][eo]
[ep]C[MG:  White should have connected, perhaps.  As Black, I'd push through and cut ('a' - 'c').


Black's slide would have been ideal much earlier, when he only had the small group to worry about, but now it's rather bad:  If White connects, C5C6 are going to come under a strong attack.  Since White is close to safe. . . .]
;W[do];B[cm];W[oi]L[ci][bh][bj][ck][dg][df]C[MG:  White's kikashi misses the focus of the game.  Consider a White probe at 'a'.  If Black at 'b', then White 'd'; or if Black 'c', the sequence White 'e', 'f', and 'b'.]
;B[ph];W[gn];B[fn]L[dm][fo][ir][ci]C[MG:  The hane may be an overplay, since White has forcing moves like 'a', and Black is left with a weak shape (imagine the variations involving 'b' and 'c').


I'd just extend at 'b' then play something like 'd' to protect the weak group on the left.]
;W[fm];B[em];W[fo]L[dm]C[MG:  White does aji keshi: he should have just pushed through at 'a'.]
;B[en];W[fp]C[MG:  This exploits Black's shape problem here.];B[gq];W[dm]
;B[el];W[gp];B[hp]L[ir]C[MG:  The connection is bad on principle.  Just dropping down to 'a' is enough to settle the Black group.


The two stones aren't important right now; White has sente, so life isn't a problem for him at the moment (though he has to read carefully to make sure he doesn't lose sente).]
;W[ir];B[hq];W[cr]L[hr]C[MG:  White 'a' would have killed some stones, I think.]
;B[eo]C[MG:  It's kikshi, but the only thing this move does is reduce Black's liberties by one.  His five stones are going to be a real burden to him.]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[cq];B[hr];W[dl]L[jr]C[MG:  Connecting at 'a' gives White a chance to capture.]

[es][nr][kj]C[ ThomasJ 2k :  I am a coward.


MG:  But connecting would have killed you:  Black at 'a', White 'b', then G2, 'c', 'd', and
'e'.


ThomasJ: My original comment was rather pointed on the ko, not on connecting. This ko would have been rather big, so maybe I should have played it instead.


MG:  Actually, winning the ko would not be so large (and would cost you the group if you lost, which is why I didn't even consider it).


If you win the ko, you have about 13 or 14 points (mostly in the lower right, by killing the aji of White 'f'); if you play at G2 then 'd', you have 3 or 4.  This is a difference of about ten points, but it's taken you two moves to gain them .  The threats around 'g' are worth more, so I don't know if you could be sure of winning the ko (especially if you consider the huge loss if the lower left Black group dies [>35 points\]).


I see Black risking at least one large group to fight a ko worth 5 points a move.  I might play this way if Black had many more ko threats than White and the game were close. . . .]
;W[ir];B[hs];W[eh];B[eg];W[fh];B[im]L[jm][in][fl]C[MG:  White may be able to run out starting with 'a' -- this should give him at least as many liberties as the running Black group and threaten to cut off the middle top stones as well.  Black will also have to cut at 'b' to get anywhere, but White just plays 'c' and it looks like a good fight.]
;W[in];B[jm];W[kn];B[ln];W[hm]L[km]C[MG:  I don't understand why White didn't play 'a' and try to pick up a few stones.]
