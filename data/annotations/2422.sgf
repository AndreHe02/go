C[Hi, my name is Ronald Wopereis. I live in the Netherlands. I
will review the game for the white side.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[pj];W[dj];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[eo]LB[dr:A][ep:A][fo:A]
C[I notice you play this type of non-connection move a lot. Try
to play A at instead. Think of a checkpoint charley barrier ,
only 2 cars wide and yet very solid.];B[dr];W[dq]C[this move will bring no victory. Look at howmany territory is
to be earned, elsewhere on the battlefield.];B[eq]C[but then again, if black falls into it...]
;W[cr]C[good move.];B[ds];W[bp]C[nice work so far.];B[jp]C[I think this black move ends the fight in the left lower corner.
It's time for white to do the same to black in the opposite corner!]
;W[ho];B[hp];W[go]C[Now white has lost the initiative. Instead of white attacking
black, we will see how black takes advantage of this situation.]
;B[fc];W[gd];B[gc];W[ic]TR[fc][gc]C[don't overplay your hand. the white wall at the D-line is still
very weak. If you want to catch the marked stones, you must have
a white wall
to rawhide them into.];B[fd];W[ge];B[fe];W[ff]LB[db:D18]C[D18 much more needed. Look at your way of playing. It looks like
you look up to the 23k* player: you wait for him to attack. This
is unnecessary respect. Play your own game!];B[ib];W[hb];B[jb]
;W[jc];B[hc];W[hd];B[kc];W[je];B[cf]C[Again, black is the one to attack. You see the pattern? After
10 moves, all of this area (lines A thru D) was for white.

Now black is invading, and it is possible because white is expanding
where the base (A thru D) is not yet consolidated.];W[de];B[df]
;W[be];B[di];W[ci];B[dh];W[bf]LB[cj:C10]C[C10  is needed here. What you miss here is some basic shape,
some solid ground.];B[ef];W[cg]LB[cb:C18][cg:C13]TR[jb][ib]
[hb][hc][gc][fc][fd][fe][ff][ee][ef][df][dg][eg][dh][di][eh]
SQ[ac][ca][da][db][dc][cc][bc][ab][bb][ba][aa]C[Look at how you play your opponent's play. I don't blame you,
you play 29K. 

(a) the area marked with squares is still open for fight. The
first one to play C18 will probably settle the case.

(b) C13 will not cut the marked black chain.];B[ee];W[dg];B[eg]
;W[gj]LB[id:J16][gf:G14][ff:F14]TR[hb][jc][ic][ge][hd][gd]C[This move means you give up the marked group . Now black G14
leaves you with a double attack, because F14 cannot
be saved and black J16 threatens to kill all of the white stones
marked.];B[ch];W[bg];B[fi];W[fh]LB[fj:F10][fh:F12]SQ[aa][ab]

[em][el][ek][fn][fm][fk][fl][gk][gl][gm][gn][cj][ai][aj][do]
[hl][hm][hn][hk][bj]C[this move is bad for two reasons.

(a) black can push the stone in the hands of the black enemy:
play away from an enemy wall. meaning: F10 is oke, F12 is wrong.
Consider the stone F12 as lost.

(b) you have still not decided if you want to own the marked
upper left area (12 points), its not yours yet. 
Nor have you decided if you would want the marked lower left
area (40 points), it is also not yours yet.];B[fg];W[gf];B[gh]
;W[hg];B[ej]TR[ff][gf][ge][gd][hd]C[Black has faith that he will catch the marked group later on
in the
game. He is now planning to decrease the 40 point area that white
has not claimed yet.];W[ck]LB[dk:B][bi:B][cj:A]C[Black B can do you much harm now. Why not play A?]
;B[ek];W[dk]C[good move];B[el];W[dm]C[again, good move. these are solid shapes.]

[ok][pk][qk][rk][sk][sj][rj][qj]C[this is extension by black.  very powerful, but also he's bluffing.
He wants you to believe that all of the marked area  is already
his. Don't believe him, for if you do , the game is over right
at this moment.

Play your own game!];W[hh]TR[cf][df][ef][eg][fg][ee][fe][fd]
[fc][gc][hc]C[I'm not sure what your plans are. This move will not lead to
victory. You cannot surround and catch the marked black group.
Forget it.

So I presume you want to build a living shape, a shape with two
eyes.];B[jl]C[Black is extending 18 more points.];W[il]LB[il:J8]
[jl:K8]TR[el][ek][ej][ei][eh][eg][ef][ee][fe][fd][fc][gc][hc]
[hb][ib][jb][fg][fh][fi][dh][di][ch][cf][df][gh][kc][kb]C[If you admit that the marked black chain is alive, then
you see that J8 is a move right in between two enemy walls. Pressing
against K8 only makes it worse for you (it makes the black right
wall stronger)];B[im];W[hl];B[hm];W[gm];B[in]TR[dm][em][fm]
[gm][gl]C[Look how black connects to a solid shape. He must be very eager
to cut the marked white connection, but he knows that
solid shape is needed.

If all soldiers leave town to attack away in the hills, and then
the enemy comes into town, they will find no resistence.];W[hn]
;B[io]C[here you can see that black also has to learn. Black's move is
unnecessary
at this point. I think he plays it because of the psychology
of the game: you play after him, now he lets the advantage to
you.
Will white attack at his next move?];W[jk];B[ep]SQ[kl][oe][of]
[og][oh][oi][oj][ok][ol][nl][nk][nj][ni][nh][ng][nf][ne][me]
[le][ke][kf][lf][mf][mg][lg][kg][kh][lh][mh][mi][li][ki][kj]
[lk][mk][mj][lj][ml][ll][kk]C[bad move for black. leave them small points, concentrate on the
marked
area, which is still open.];W[fo];B[gl];W[fl]LB[em:A][fm:A]
C[why not play at A?];B[fm];W[gk];B[fk];W[gl];B[em];W[en]LB[gn:G6]
C[G6 to connect.
Now you play it at your next move. 
This cost you one move. 
This is the reason why you seem to have less moves than black,
and thus defending dozens of fires that black has lit.];B[fn]
;W[gn];B[kk];W[jj];B[kj];W[ki];B[km];W[ll]LB[kl:L8]C[this move is much too close to the enemy wall. you will force
him to play L8 and therefore help the black wall to become stronger
and stronger];B[kl];W[lj];B[lk];W[ml];B[mk];W[nl];B[li];W[kh]
TR[ki][do][eo][fo][go][gn][gm][gl][hl][il][ik][jk][jj][ji][kh]
C[good move. Now the marked white chain is alive, with every move
that
extends this chain will decrease the territory of your opponent
with two points at least.];B[ol];W[mn]C[Nice try, but the group is already dead.]
;B[mp];W[on];B[pn];W[pm];B[om];W[ok]C[good move];B[pl]TR[om]
[ol][pl]C[solid black shape];W[qm]TR[pl][ol][om]C[see how difficult it is with these solid shapes? you need only
three stones to irritate the opponent.];B[pk];W[nk];B[ni];W[mh]
TR[ll][ml][nl][nk][ok][mm][mn][nn][on]C[This move means you give up on the marked white group.]
;B[mi];W[lh];B[nh];W[ng];B[og];W[of];B[nf];W[mg];B[pf];W[oe]
;B[pe];W[ne];B[ph]C[Again, this is one of black's strong moves.
He now controls about 2/3 of the board.
Roughly south of A1-T19 diagonal. And possibly lines 17-19.
White controls about 1/3 of the board. Lower left part (square
A1-D9) and the area in between the two white walls (square H9-L15)]
;W[oc]LB[ne:O15]C[this is a good attack, but look what happens in the next 10 moves
(up to move 139). It looks like you are getting tired. You loose
the spirit of fight. So maybe better to give up, or pause the
game for a moment, or get inspiration somewhere.

White's move is good because it is a horsejump from O15 which
is a safe stone.];B[od]LB[nd:O16]C[Horsejump still possible. White should now play O16.]
;W[md]TR[nd][ne][oe][of][nc][oc][mc]C[this is your habituation we talked about earlier. A solid shape
is marked. 
The current white move is possible, but costs 4 more points of
territory.];B[nd]C[here you see that the best move for black is the move that is
best for white.];W[me]LB[oc:A][nc:C]C[this forced move, but it costs you about 20 points. Look at the
difference where you could have played at C.];B[mc]LB[oc:A]
SQ[nc][ka][kb][lb][la][ma][mb][na][nb][lc][ld][kd][ob][oa]C[Now you see A all by itself. 
All of the marked area is now lost.];W[kd];B[ld]LB[kb:A]C[black is very selfconfident here. I wonder what happens if white
plays at A now. See variations (2x).]
(;W[le];B[lc];W[nb];B[nc];W[pa];B[ob];W[pc];B[mb];W[qb];B[na]
;W[rc];B[pb];W[qc];B[oa]LB[re:S15]C[this is cat and mouse play. 
the white group can only live if the player knows about life
and death. S15 is appropriate now.];W[qa];B[re]C[black knows.]
;W[rd];B[se];W[sd]LB[sb:H]C[Now this is a typical life and death shape. H is the heart
of the shape. If white plays at H, the group lives with two
eyes. But if black plays at H, the group is dead.];B[sb]LB[qd:A]
[sc:A][rb:A][ra:A]C[white group is dead.

you can test this by assuming that black will surround the white
group, playing at A.

But then you interfere, and play to kill the black group inside
your white group. Then black will immediately play at the heart
again so the games starts all over, but now with 4 instead
of 5 liberties for white, as you needed one white stone to kill
the small black group.

This process will repeat itself until black has surrounded the
white group and eventually kills it.];W[bh]C[Good move. This area is by no means safe yet.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[dc];W[bd];B[cc];W[dl];B[bc];W[fj]C[This is sneaky :-)))]
;B[ei];W[gi];B[eh];W[gg]LB[bj:B10][gg:G13][hf:H14]C[Not yet needed. G13 and H14 are exchangeable. Wait until black
moves into one of them, then connect the other.

More important is to connect at B10!];B[cs];W[br];B[bs];W[ar]
;B[fr];W[as]LB[qn:A]C[Dame move.  Means no point for either side. This kind of moves
you play only after you see no more useful moves.
You can stil kick ass at A];B[hr];W[ec];B[ed];W[eb];B[gb];W[fa]
;B[ha];W[fh]C[Still hopes to capture this huge black group eh? I can't blame
you, but this opponent is way too smart. He knows life and death
shapes, so I think his play level is beyond 23K*. More like 20k
or so.];B[db];W[ja];B[ka]C[I wonder why black gives in one point by playing in his own territory...]
;W[ac];B[ab];W[ad];B[ba];W[po];B[qn];W[qo];B[rn];W[rm]LB[ss:EYE]
[rq:EYE][lh:M12]TR[sp][sr][sq][qr][rp][qq][rs][rr][qp]C[This is useless. You will not get across.
Instead you should try to build a living shape, see the triangle
example.

From there on you can extend to decrease black territory, the
way you did near M12 earlier.];B[oo];W[nn]LB[mp:N4]C[this is bad luck. you don't know about life and death shapes.
black knows that N4 is the heart of the shape that you are building,
and it is therefore already dead.];B[ro];W[no];B[qp];W[np];B[nq]
;W[op];B[oq];W[mq];B[lp];W[lr]C[remember for future plays: First build something solid, like
a living shape with two eyes when you are behind enemy lines.
Just after that, you can extend. Not before.

I think you played a nice game of go, and you have to go and
study life and death.
Also, you have to understand that the only way to win a game
is to play your own game. Waiting for an opponent is leaving
you with no territory.

I hope you enjoyed my comment. Just use whatever seems useful,
and ignore the rest. Have fun playing go!
