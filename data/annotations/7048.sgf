C[Hi! Here goes your review.];B[ed];W[eg];B[gd];W[cf]C[White E3 has miai for life (left or right) so might consider simply take the upper left corner. (E6 is high so that cannot block white possible extension on the upper side.) White has komi, so ballanced game favors him/her.

Protecting one corner is less convertible. It says: I want *this* corner.]
;B[gg];W[cc]C[If white goal is to win by territory (considering komi) he must play solid. C7 is far away, and black will feel compelling desire to cut (or reduce). 

In this position c6 would be more solid, playing hard for territory might be successful with 6 komi. 

Please notice, if white plays c7 first instead c4, then after black g3 white can freely place his third stone anywhere he wants. For example a good place at c5. In this case things are already set.]
;B[ce];W[be]TR[eb][de]C[simply playing for territory is not an option now. beeing the left side pressed low black has more point. 

Its time for counterattack. Cut black, let her live if favorable and destroy her territory in exchange.]

(;W[dd]TR[cd]C[Capture is better. Black forcing move at d7 is natural, consider variation...]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[dh];W[ch]C[too deffensive.  White has very small territory. if lower side is settled further invasion will be very very hard if not impossible.

If you planning anything in this game (invasion of course :) the cutting point at e4 surely has important role in it.]
;B[eh];W[gc]C[I know it was too late just had to try.

yeah i fear it was indeed. Starting at f8 might be a bit more tricky, however with gote endgame at c1, black might simply  allow to connect and still win.]

9x9 is known to be a "fighting board". On such a small board taking territory with the first moves usually not  the best strategy. (too easy to see what do you want to do) You should remain flexible during the entire game. Even the endgame! In my opinion furikawari (ability to exchange) is the key of 9x9 games (maybe other sizes also :).

Remember you dont need too many points. Even 2 points in two eyes is quiet enough if your opponent has only 7 :-)]
