;B[pp];W[ec];B[de];W[ee]C[*** W c16 is a more common move in this case. A possible continuation would be b c15, w b16.

Attaching to the stone on the fourth line only helps black.]
;B[dg];W[pd];B[dp];W[qn];B[on]C[hmm .. o3 or 4 would be better. if b plays here he had to add a follow up move at the lower side, but then he would loose sente.]
;W[qk]C[*** Right! this is the move for building a solid base!]
;B[jf]C[*** This move is very vague. Neither does it keep w from making territory at the upper side (it rather induces that ..), nor does it work well with the stones on the left for w can cut the single stone off. W has a strong position on the upper/right side, but if B wants to reduce it, he should rather try a deeper invasion (3rd of 4th line)! Also he might leave it for now (but that is risky) and try to reduce it later, then by light moves and connecting towards the center. I would try it now, though.   But keep in mind how big a move like k4 would be for B here!]
;W[jc];B[of];W[pf]C[*** I'd say, it would be better to play calm here and keep to r 14. This stone at q14 gives b a target to attack (which he didnt.use, though)]
;B[ph];W[dn];B[fo];W[co];B[cl]C[*** This is a nice combination of attacking and extending from the upper left corner in 1 move! Still I'd rater extend no furter than to c9, to avoid a counterattack at c 10 later when w is settled in the corner.]
;W[cp];B[cq];W[ep];B[eq];W[eo];B[fp];W[fn];B[gl]C[*** again not solid enough. this cries for a counterattack. b should play e8 which is solit and stil puts pressure on W.]
;W[gn];B[hp];W[ok]C[*** this move is not too urgent. the stones seem quite fafe for W still has s4 and s11. More urgent would be to do something about the white group in the lower left corner!]
;B[ni]C[*** This move seems a bit useless.It is no threat for the white group. Does also not protekt against the cut at p13.]
;W[ml];B[in]C[*** Right! W can still run away at H7, but B gains a lot by chaising W . This move works nicely with the lower right corner.]
;W[qp];B[np]C[*** ok, but why not close the corner at r3 first?]
;W[cc]C[*** A very big move. But still you should take care for your weak group in the lower left first! Even if it does not get killed, b can gain a lot by chaising this group.]
;B[nd];W[oc];B[lc];W[hd]C[*** J 15 is bigger and also safe.]
;B[jd];W[id];B[ff]C[*** k16 does not make sense without l16! Now w should take advantage of this and ruin b's position!]
;W[ci]C[***

1. this pincer only makes sense if the group in the lower left is solid! Now W helps B by forcing thim to attack this group!  (Anlso note thet the right point for the pincer in this context would be c10.

2. F14 made the black group very vulnerable. Dont hesitate to cut here (E14)!!! The w position at the upper side is a stron base for a fight, so this would be the better side to attack from!]
;B[di];W[ck];B[el];W[bl];B[cm];W[bm];B[cn];W[bn]C[*** The result is much more than W could have hoped for! The weak group in the lower left is safe now and b's sphere of influence on the left is whiped out! W leads now, for the black position in the center can be attacked from any side while white has prospective trrritory along three sides of the board.]
;B[pj];W[dl];B[em];W[en];B[dm];W[pk];B[nk];W[nl];B[lj]C[*** B's shape is weak. w should cut (e.g. p10 or q10) to make a road into b's territory!]
;W[mn];B[lo];W[kl]C[*** This shape is weak here. b can threat a cut at m7.]
;B[jk];W[kn];B[qf];W[qe];B[pg];W[pe];B[rg];W[io]C[*** Good move! W#s only problem in this game should be how to reduce the lower territory. j5 can be connected to either sideand therefore is ideal for an invasion or at least a reduction!]
;B[jo];W[ho];B[jn]C[*** B should sacrifie j6 and safe the lower side by j4!! This is VERY urgent!]
;W[ip];B[gp];W[bg]C[*** big move, ok, but if W would go on to ruin the lower side (e.g. l3) B could resign!]
;B[ch];W[bh];B[cj];W[bi]C[*** B b10is better. always try to cut if you can afford ti (= if your own position is strong enough)]

 jaimea 24k : I'm crawling very low!

***  --> see my comment on move 52!];W[be];B[he];W[ge];B[fe]
;W[gf]C[*** g14 is risky, but it's the right decision. B gets a bit, but the way into b's territory is worth tre sacrifice. But still there are better ways like L16.]
;B[ed];W[if];B[ie];W[hf];B[je]C[
 satori 26k*: Not everywhere...

*** well, but w's L14 chance is spoiled now.];W[fd];B[ef];W[dd]
C[*** A solid move (f17 ) is the better choise here!];B[fc]
;W[ee];B[hh];W[gg]C[*** Better would be g12 (and Bg13 Wj12 Bh12 Wj13 for example) or the other way round by j12.]

 satori 26k*: Did I miss something?
 jaimea 24k : I don't think so. Maybe me :-(

*** well, there was not much b could do I think. Sice B was cut into by j1 both B's and W's groups were weak. So B had to do several defending moves which gave W time to make a base.]
;B[mp]C[
 jaimea 24k : I just thought my group was dead];W[mq]C[*** now q3 / r3 becomes very big for both players.]

;B[im];W[mm]C[*** This is (like b's next move) a verysmall move.  It threatens to kill 2 stones (= 4 points, but here even less since b could retake > so this is just 1 point inthe end) while b's move at k7 just saves the 2 stones. Meanwhile playing  Q3 now should decide the game!!!]

C[*** B's position here is open to the upper side AND to the right side. You should take advantage of that and play a move like n16. Take a look at the variations starting from there. It does much more harm and b has to watch out or his whole position might crumble!]
;B[md]C[*** Now b is perfectly safe];W[nc];B[od];W[ce]C[*** big move]
;B[fb];W[eb];B[gb]C[
