Hi!I'd like comments on 
fuseki and middle game thanks.Also, I'd like comments on all my errors :).Thx]
;B[qd]C[belona [3k\]: hi];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]LB[de:A][cn:B]C[Which approach is more common? Aor B?

- A looks good enough.

For aproaching D4 still you have two possibilities ( F3 or C6).]
;B[de];W[cg];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb]C[Was A an overplay?


- Joseki is B.  

You played A  with strategy to put stone on opponents vital point.  

In this case it seems this strategy is bad.]
(;B[gd]C[Was this an overplay?


- Yes, it was better to play E14.];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[dg];W[dd]
;B[ce]C[- This was bad, C14 is better.];W[ci];B[gg];W[ge]C[Where are the biggest points now?

- Not easy to decide.
A is also strong.]
(;B[oc];W[hd];B[pj];W[qn];B[qo]C[Was this good?

- I think it was. 

Your opponent made his first mistake. Better for him was aproaching from the other side on O3.]
;W[pn];B[np];W[ql];B[qk]LB[nk:A]C[Was this good? or A better?

- You played with more pressure on the right side, what looks to me better then A (lets white to live easy with S10).

Quite well !];W[ol];B[nk];W[mm];B[kq]LB[jq:A]C[Mv 33 at A?

- Not an easy question.
A gives more chances for white later to invade black lower right corner. L3 gives white more space to invade later when black aproach on F3.

(;W[ch]C[- White could better. For me this was not necessary and to slow..]
;B[nl]C[- This was not urgent.];W[nm];B[fq]LB[cn:A]C[here or A?

- Your move on F3 is with good sense.

- White atacked your teritory too deep with 24 and 42 resulting with  two weak groups. On the other side, your main separating move on L6 was bad.]

Thanks , please tell me what I need to improve on

- Keep on going with games like this one.

Your defending skill is higher then atacking, what means atack with more patience and use calm atacking moves more frequently.]
