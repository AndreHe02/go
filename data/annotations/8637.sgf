AB[pd][dp]C[Game played on KGS (January 1st, 2011)

Komi 0,5

30 minutes each, and 30 sec. byo-yomi.

Hello!
My name is Martin, my pseudo on KGS is Hludowicus. I lost this game by a big margin (25,5 moku), but I would not have lost by more than 5 moku if I did not make a big mistake in the yose.

I feel that this game is representative of my level at the moment. Your comments will certainly help me a great deal. Do not hesitate to be blunt: I am not easily offended :)

Thank you for reviewing!
Martin

Hi, I'm your reviewer, Kheng Hun. I will be marking my comments with KH:]
;W[qq];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B[eb];W[fc]C[KH: moves 7 and 9 are not joseki, white is at a disadvantage]
;B[ec];W[ed]C[I was very happy with the result in the upper left corner. White's shape is bad. I thought I could leave things as they are for the moment.]
;B[np];W[po]C[I felt that my stone at O4 was useful as it is, and that I was mistaken in not pursuing my advantage immediately in the upper left corner. This explains my next move...]

;B[cq]TR[fd][fe][fg]C[I might be terribly mistaken, but I felt my fuseki was looking good. If my 3 stones in the upper right live, White doesn't have much prospect for territory up to now, and his two big groups in the upper left are divided]

;B[dh]C[I thought: "if I manage to make these stones live, I have a decent chance of winning, since White seems to be playing for center influence".

SE puts white ahead by a little, however, black has sente so the game is still even.

I'm sure that from your viewpoint, you see many important errors of judgement in my play. I am very interested to hear about it, since I do not see them very well myself. I really have the impression that I'm playing a good game. I know I'm delusional :)]

[er][as][cs][ds][es]C[That's it! Once again, thank you very much for the time you're putting into this review.

KH: to conclude, there were several mistakes by both players in the opening-midgame, however, the endgame was most painful.
white made mistakes in defending her center territory while black could have used a tesuji in the center to gain more points.

Advise for endgame:
play the double sente moves first, then the sente moves
double sente moves are biggest since both players want them.

As for the opening, you can try to learn more joseki.

A major weakness I see in you (and sometimes white as well) would be the reading. The game pace is still rather slow (for my rank) so you should take your time to read out sequences. For example, you could have connected your center stones and you could omit several connections at the top, giving you more time to play other moves.

Counting is another thing you can try to refine. By comparing the values of different endgame positions, you may just earn an extra 1 or 2 points to give you the win.

I hope I have been helpful and not too harsh on you. Hope you can improve in Weiqi.

Regards,
Kheng Hun])
