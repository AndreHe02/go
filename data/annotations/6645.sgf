C[poleman [5k\]: hi gl

Hi. Interesting game. W made a lot of mistakes with his direction of play in the beginning of the game, but hung tough and found the chance to win. B needed to be more aware of his weaknessess, and how to shore them up when he has a lead on territory. the easiest way to do this would be to put more pressure on weak groups earlier in the game.

For future review requests it is helpfull to add your own comments and questions to the game file. It can be easier for the reviewer to point out how you can improve if he knows what you are thinking about at different key points in the game.]
