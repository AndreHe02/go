Reviewer: Ivanov Viktor 3d

This is my first review on GTL, hope it is not very bad and will be useful. Enjoy]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[op];W[dd]TR[op]C[Black's p4 move is a bit funny looking. I'm not sure how he plans to use it, right now I would probably enclose the corner with r4.]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[jd]TR[op]SQ[dp]C[B didn't choose my way and it's still feels a bit weird. W's hoshi prevents b's potential on the bottom and the corner is still open. So all w needs is to reduce right side.]

(;W[qf]C[This is posible.];B[qh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[rf]
;B[og]C[After this joseki there are three valuable places left: left side, bottom side and bottom-right corner.]

(;W[qo]C[This move is for making territory on the right side. It's not reasonable.]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[qq];W[po];B[oo];W[qk];B[rq]
(;W[le]C[Maybe a little too deep, but I did't want to help black to consolidate his territiory easyly.

This is one of possible moves for reducing.]
(;B[lc]C[Ok, no problem for me.

B is very kind.];W[ne];B[mf];W[nc]C[Pretty dangerous stuff is going on.]

(;B[of];W[ld];B[kc];W[lf]C[I felt I am ok now. My stones are out in the center.

Your group is a bit heavy tho. Would be better if you ran away immediately.]
;B[ob]C[I did't expect this. Too slow I think.

And wasn't sente!]
(;W[qb];B[nb];W[if]C[No i am feeling fine.];B[qm];W[pm];B[ql]
;W[pl];B[rk];W[rj];B[rl]C[I expected R10 instead giving a little profit to black but making my group secure.]
;W[pj];B[rn];W[ro]C[I thought about P6 instead, let him connect and taking sente.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[on]
(;W[sn]C[This is not good.];B[sm]C[Now it's ko.];W[rm];B[qe]
;W[re];B[rn];W[so];B[pp];W[rm];B[de];W[sl]C[I decided not to answer. I calculated, that I do not have a big enough ko threat. And if black wins the ko, the remaining white group looks very weak.]
;B[ce]
(;W[fd]C[Seems to be a miscalculation by me. I thought black can't play E16.]

C[But now I think, that the alternative had been better.

It is not very useful result for w, I agree.];W[jq]C[Is it really good timing for this move? W's group on the top is still weak.]

;W[fe];B[eh];W[fh];B[ei];W[fk];B[ej];W[hk];B[dl]C[This is certainly big. Maybe too big and I should have played E9 instead of J9?

W couldn't do anything about b's right side because of the very heavy group.]

;W[jb];B[jc];W[ia];B[kb];W[ha];B[ja]C[You had a decent opening but you didn't play in urgent places. That caused many complications.
The last thing was trying to kill when you was too weak and it ended very bad.

Try to not miss urgent moves later. Thank you.])
