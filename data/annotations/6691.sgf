AB[pd][dp][pp]C[ChisiWahla [7k\]: Hello
naitoy [4k\]: hi


Linux: Hi. I think also, black lost the game at the opening stage. After W23 the game was nearly over...
Thats why I will stop my main comment at move 44.

The fight, that then appears shows some mistakes on both sides.]
;W[dd];B[fc];W[jd]
(;B[db]LB[fe:A][dg:B]C[Linux: D18 here is too passive I think. To  jump out with A has better effect on the rigt white stone. A double approach around B is also a good move.  I would to invade. See Variation.]
;W[dh]LB[dg:A]C[Linux: Normally A is the widest move for white.]
;B[cc]LB[fe:A][pj:B]C[Linux: If you want to play here, you has to play A.  You dont have to settle your D18 group at this time.
Better is to let the situation as it is and take a big point around B.]
;W[cd];B[bd]C[Linux: With B16 you makes your opponent strong only ... and this sequence ends in sente for white. 
Locally F15 is the better threat.];W[be];B[bc];W[nq]C[Linux: To let white approach here is the result of the too mild moves at the top.]
;B[qn];W[jp];B[hq];W[pr];B[qq];W[jq]
(;B[ho]LB[cj:A]C[Linux: This move is a little fearfully. Black should try to take the initiative on the left side with A.]
;W[cn]LB[dj:A]C[Linux: This is an ideal approach  for white. It attack the corner AND prepare an moyo at the left. (The H5 stone couldnt help your group here effective). Black has no good follow up move. I would suggest A and fight.]
;B[co];W[dn];B[fo];W[qi]C[Linux: To let white take this point loose the game I think. Your handicap is eaten up (at move 23!)]

(;B[qg];W[ql];B[og]C[R13 was the wrong side to approach. (see variation) Think of the weakness ouf your Q4 group]
;W[nc]TR[og][ho]C[Linux: This is the similar situation as before. H5 and P13 have no enough effect and help white to develop himself.]
;B[pc];W[ne];B[ic]LB[dj:A]TR[dh][cn][dn]C[Linux: J17 here is not enough. White is ahead, so you must attack him. Maybe at A. One hope for black is to split white at the left. His extension to D12 is not well balanced so C6 can be attacked.]

Maybe black has a chance to attack the r11 group. but this can be dangerous, while he is weak at the bottom.]

Maybe k18 or p18 or q15 would have gained more.  
I thought I could reduce liberties for k17 and push under and remove the base.

(;B[rk];W[qk];B[rj];W[qj];B[nj]C[This is in my opinion one way to take the initiative. White cannot be killed I think, but the relatively weakness of the white groups K17 and K4 are a good chance for black to make some points. Black must additionally reduce the left side. An invasion is not the way.]
