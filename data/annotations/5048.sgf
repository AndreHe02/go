AB[jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[I won it with 9 handi last time, so I tried 8 this time

[[Hello - my name's Adam, and I'll be reviewing this game.  My remarks are in double brackets.\]\]]
;W[hc];B[ic]C[Was this A good move?

[[That depends on what you're trying to accomplish.  If you're thinking, "I'll make this stone heavy before playing D16," fine, but be aware that in general it's a bad idea to attack with contact.  You certainly don't want to play a move like this in response to an approach to your 4-4 stone in an even game.\]\]]
;W[hd];B[dd];W[hf];B[jf];W[hh];B[he]C[Was cutting necessary?

[[That's a bad instinct.  You're lucky that White didn't come up with a better reply.  See the variations below for a glimpse of a few other possible outcomes.\]\]]

(;W[ge];B[ie];W[nq];B[gf]C[I think answering O 3 was more important, is it?

[[Actually, no - I would take advantage of White's poor play at the top, the way you have done with G14.  Not only does this look like a better play to me, but it is a bad habit to follow your opponent around the board.  White forgot to play urgent moves before big moves, and you have punished that mistake.\]\]]
;W[fe];B[fc]C[[[Good shape-destroying move.\]\]];W[no];B[gd]
C[[[No, now is when I would pull my Q4 stone out of trouble with something like Q6.  After F17, White's top group is already seriously damaged.\]\]]
;W[ff];B[gg];W[pn]C[[[And now it's too late for you to play Q6 yourself.\]\]]
;B[oo];W[on];B[nn];W[hg];B[fg];W[eg];B[gi]C[Was this a good move?

[[This is the standard way out of trouble in positions like this, yes.\]\]]
;W[fh]TR[hf][hg][hh]C[[[Wow, what a bad move.  White is really playing poorly.  All this does is weaken the triangled stones.\]\]]
;B[gh];W[hi];B[hj];W[ji];B[jh]C[Was this a tesuji?

[[Not really.  White can still break out, if that's what you mean.  White's reply was poor.\]\]]

;B[kk];W[mo];B[nm];W[ql];B[qk]C[[[Don't attack with contact.\]\]]
;W[jn];B[ko];W[hn];B[ln]C[Was cutting necessary?

[[That's not really a cut - it's just a splitting attack.  It's always a good idea to keep your opponent's stones split apart and your own stones connected.\]\]]
;W[pr];B[pl];W[qo];B[qp];W[rp];B[im]C[At last I lost my corner..:(

[[And replied with a very strange move.  H6 and K6 make up a laughably weak group for White.  You want to keep those stones from reaching the sides while they desperately try to make a tiny life floating in the center surrounded by black stones.  Something like H4 or G3 would be much better than J7.\]\]]
;W[hp];B[in];W[gn];B[fo];W[fq];B[gp]TR[gn][hn][hp]C[[[You're already way, way ahead.  "Rich men don't pick fights."  I'd be much more concerned about the corner.  White can jump in at C3, or slide to D2 and then connect up with the triangled stones.  So instead of F5 and G4, how about some nice quiet moves like D6 or D3?\]\]]
;W[go];B[io]LB[fp:A]C[I thought it should be at A

[[This whole fight is probably a bad idea in the first place.\]\]]

;W[rb];B[pa];W[ra];B[sf];W[rd];B[se]C[I wanted to make sente for myself

[[But you already have sente! After White plays S16, there are no immediate threats or opportunities locally, so you're free to go play wherever you want.\]\]]

C[[[Ah, and that's the end.\]\]

[[My summary of this game: you were playing with eight handicap stones.  The only way that White can possibly win is to play a little recklessly, pick a lot of complicated fights, and hope that you make a lot of mistakes along the way.  As Black, you want to keep things simple and protect your overwhelming lead.\]\]

[[Instead, you were the one playing all sorts of reckless, over-aggressive moves that could have backfired... and White was the one making all the mistakes in response.  So you won by a ridiculous margin.  This is not a very helpful type of game to play.  It encourages bad habits.  You think, "Hmm, these sorts of moves really work!"  But then one day you come across an opponent who knows how to punish overplays... :) \]\]

[[So my recommendation would be to avoid such high handicap games, because they bear little similarity to what even games are like.  Yes, the system may say that you're a 22k and White is a 13k.  But I know quite a few players who would argue that until you get to 10k or so, rankings are meaningless.  Certainly this 13k didn't seem any more skilled than you.  Good luck!\]\]]
