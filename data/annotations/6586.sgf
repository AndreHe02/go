;B[dc]C[Hi, I play whith white in this game. I won it but i should loose it if my opponent didn't make a mistake at the end.
Thanks !

RickMott:  Well, we all rely on our opponents to make at least some misteaks; otherwise it's very hard to win. :)

I've pointed out several tactical and strategic situations
where I think you could have made better choices.
The game-losing mistake was subtle; you gave up
two stones in the bottom center which looked
small, but turned out to be a 30-point difference
in the score (see variations around move 76)!

The biggest improvement you can make, I think, is to
 work on your reading skills.  Spend some time doing
life-and-death problems, and study a couple of tesuji
 books.  I can suggest "1001 Go Problems" and
 "Get Strong at Tesuji", and "The Art Of Cutting and
Connecting" as examples.  I like the series "The Art Of... "
 because they organize the problems around a common theme.

Good luck!];W[pp];B[dp];W[pd];B[ce];W[pj];B[nd];W[pf];B[oc]
;W[pc];B[nb]C[RickMott: This doesn't seem like the biggest move to me at this stage of the game.   So you should not answer it.   An approach move against the lower left corner, such as F3, is much bigger.]
;W[pb];B[kd]C[RickMott: Still looks small.  Black has expended four stones to get maybe 8 points, and makes your corner rock solid.]
;W[jp]C[RickMott: Ok, but it gives black the opportunity to make a nice extension to H3 and then a double-wing on the left side if you answer.  I'd play closer to the corner stone and try to force him to answer locally.  But this is at least in the biggest open area of the board, so it's a reasonable move.]
;B[hq]C[RickMott: I wrote the last comment before I looked at this move.  I didn't cheat here. :)]
;W[iq];B[fp];W[ir]C[RickMott: As in the upper right, this is a very small move, worth only a few points in the endgame.  A black hane here is not even sente against you.  You really must use this move to invade black's left side before he has a chance to make a giant moyo.  Black should ignore you and play on the left.]
;B[cn]C[RickMott: Which he does, but too tight to the corner.  You should probably invade on the left at C11 or so, then run out into the center.]
;W[mq]C[RickMott: This is probably too tight.  If you want to defend the bottom, consider the 3-3 point (R3).  It would be very hard for black to play around N3 and live.  He could reduce you at N4, but you could make profit chasing him.

I still think a play on the left is bigger, though.  You could either invade at C11 or reduce at D10.  Both would be huge.]
;B[dj]C[RickMott: Black got there first.   Bummer.];W[pm]C[RickMott: This move leaves a lot of open space in the corner for Black to work with.  If you're going to defend this territory, I would consider a move like R4 instead and dare Black to try an invasion.  He can reduce you, but you should be able to reduce his moyo while attacking the invading/reducing stone.]
;B[hd]C[RickMott: I think this is to small scale.  The way the game is developing, Black should probably take tengen (center point) now.]
;W[qp]C[I was thinking that it was maybe the time for black to go to the san-san, but I think that this move is bad...

RickMott: Not bad, but it leaves black with sente.  I think it is worth less than the center point.]
;B[jj]C[... and when he played this move, I was afraid. He take a lot of territory, and I don't really know the way to counter his influence.

RickMott: Yes, you are behind now.  Think how different this would look if the center stone were yours. :

You can consider an invasion in the lower left corner, or start reducing the black moyo and expanding yours in the center.  I think a good way to start would be H5, for example.  But you have many possibilities: K8, J7 look reasonable too.  I think this is the right area to start in, though.  Your broad plan must be to restrain black's moyo while building your own in the lower right.]
;W[jg]C[RickMott: Right idea (reduce moyo), but   I think you are not as strong here as you would be on the bottom.  You are too far inside black's sphere of influence.  He should jump out from O16 and try to surround you on a large scale.]
;B[hg]C[RickMott: But he chooses to try defending his territory, which is good for you.]
;W[nf]C[RickMott: Hmm.  I think something like J12 might be better.  You strengthen your stone locally and separate H13 from K10, threatening either to cut off K10 or break further into the moyo.  This defensive move doesn't look like it makes a big moyo of your own, and lets his shore up the gap between K10 and H13.]
;B[lg]C[RickMott: Wow, both players get wild and crazy. ;)]

(;W[me]C[RickMott: Why here?  It doesn't help your stone in danger.  Better options would be (1) L12, to break through the gap between M13 and K10 and run back toward your stones, or (b) M14, to fight locally.   See variations.]
;B[md];W[le];B[kf];W[ke]C[RickMott: Pushing first at M16 is sente.  Black must respond or you get the four-stone group around O17.   It's always a good idea to create cutting points if you can do so in sente.]
;B[jd];W[jf];B[je];W[kg];B[lf]C[RickMott: This connection is bad for Black.  he should give up the stones and strengthen the connection between K10 and H13.  Probably J12 is good.]
;W[lh];B[mg];W[mh];B[ng];W[og];B[nh];W[ni];B[oh];W[ph];B[oi]
;W[oj]C[RickMott: Good luck for you!  Black should not have played out this sequence.  Now you have 16 points in captured stones plus a wall.  This turned the game around for you.  Bad mistake by black.]
;B[mi]C[RickMott:  He can wiggle on the hook, but it won't help.]
;W[nj];B[li];W[kh];B[ki];W[mf]C[RickMott: No, you don't have to answer yet.  Much better to break through the gap by playing J12 or J13.  You can take these stones anytime; wait until you are forced to do so.]
;B[jn];W[hp]C[RickMott: Good move.];B[gq];W[go];B[fm];W[jl]
C[RickMott: This leads to a very complicated fight.   I'd be more inclined to extend up with H7 first.  It can't be cut off, and you can threaten either to break way into the moyo or cut off K6 which I think is an overplay.]
;B[il];W[im];B[jm];W[hl];B[ik];W[gm];B[in];W[hm];B[gk];W[fn]
;B[hk];W[kl]C[RickMott: You come out ahead in the fight, and are now in the lead.]
;B[ll]
(;W[nn]C[RickMott: No, I think you have to save the two stones with a hane at M9; they're important cutting stones worth at least  30 points.  See variations.  You can keep much more of the bottom moyo this way, and I think you maintain a clear lead.]
;B[km]C[RickMott: Ouch.  This capture is a 30+ point loss for you, and Black is ahead.]
;W[mk];B[lk];W[ml];B[mm];W[nm];B[lo];W[mo];B[lp];W[lq];B[mp]
;W[np];B[mn];W[no]C[RickMott: Way too small to answer.  This is a tiny endgame move, maybe 1-1/2 points.  Much bigger, for example to atari at E7.]
;B[io];W[ip];B[dq];W[em]C[RickMott: Well, OK, you get it anyway. :)]
;B[fl];W[en];B[dl];W[hf]C[RickMott: Excellent!  This is now the biggest area.  You must use these stones to reduce black's moyo.]
;B[gf];W[ig];B[he];W[if];B[hh];W[ii];B[hi]C[RickMott: You are lucky here.  Black could have just pushed through at J12 and captured your stone.]
;W[ji];B[ij];W[ld]C[RickMott: Sente, good move.];B[lc];W[fs]
C[RickMott: Good, this is big.];B[dg]C[RickMott: Black doesn't know how to respond.  This move doesn't seem necessary to me; I don't see how you can invade here and live (but maybe that's why I'm only 4k AGA :).

Black should play F2, forcing you to back up at G1.];W[er]C[RickMott: I think you can do better by jumping to D1.  Black will have to yield several more points that way, and I think you end with sente.]
;B[dr];W[eq];B[ep];W[hr];B[gr];W[gs];B[oe]C[RickMott: Black missed a 4-point capture here.  If he ataris at J12, you cannot connect]
;W[pe];B[of]C[RickMott: but once black forces you to capture...]
;W[pi]C[RickMott: Now the 4-point opportunity is gone.  The game is simplifying now, and black is clearly ahead.  I'll be very interested to see how you managed to win from here.]
;B[gp];W[ho];B[hn];W[gn];B[dn];W[kp]C[RickMott: Sets up the threat of double atari.  The diagonal play of L5 is one point better, though.  Black can't cut you off or you still get the double atari.]
;B[ko];W[jo];B[ln];W[dm];B[cm];W[el];B[ek];W[od];B[ne];W[kc]
;B[kb]C[RickMott: Oops.  Now I see how you won.  Black should just descend here at M18.]
;W[jc]C[RickMott: No, no, double atari at N17!  Huge move, might put you back in the game.]
;B[ic]C[RickMott: But black misses it, so...];W[mc];B[jb];W[nc]
;B[mb];W[ob]C[RickMott: You get 12 points, and now you've picked up enough to win  Game over.]
;B[na];W[mj];B[lj];W[hs]C[RickMott: the hane at D1 is worth several points in sente, you should take it first.]
;B[ds];W[es];B[eo];W[gl];B[fk];W[jh]C[RickMott: Why here?  J12 is worth a point.]
