AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, I'm Andrew, and I'll be reviewing your game. I will try to answer your questions to the best of my ability. If I miss something and you still have questions afterward, please email me at ajnz1234@gmail.com

dear reviewer,

this game is between me (2k) and 2dan player.

in this game, black made a good opening and then lost big groups and resigned. during review, we agreed on white's opening moves was not suitable for a 3 handicap game. he was sealed in corners and allowed black to make a huge moyo.

however, we didn't agree on black's continuation moves. they said black put himself into a risky fight. regarding black's strenght around, I dont agree.

I'd also wish to hear your thoughts about black's moves regarding this is a 3 handicap game. I mean, should black think this way: this move/fight is good in an even game but since my opponent is stronger, I should play slightly submissive compared to an even game.

thanks in advance,

[kd][fc]MA[hg][gg][fg][ef][ee][ed]C[they said this cut is unnecessary. but isn't hane to submissive here?

**
The hane may have seemed too submissive, but it would seal off more of the center than white would make at the top.

The X's mark what white gains if you play the outisde hane. The triangles mark what white gets anyway in the real game. It is only a matter of about 15 points.

The circles mark the general area that you get if you play the outside hane that you cannot be assured of getting with this move. It is about 30 points, so it is a 15 point gain.

I do not intend any of this counting to be precise. Hopefully it is clearer this way, though, that because the center is so much bigger than the top side, sealing it off it extremely big.]

;W[hj];B[gi];W[hh]C[they also said g13 and these two moves arent good. i just played them to force white to a bad shape

**
They probably were commenting on how the two black stones are now short of liberties. Also, the G13 push (62) decreases your own stones' liberties, which you want to avoid as a rule (though here it is does not matter a whole lot).

Personally, I am okay with the black position because even if white captures the two black stones, his other eye is not clear.]
;B[eg]C[to me this looks very good for black. white is surrounded by black stones on each side. to me, losing the fight and the game after this situation is caused by black played bad after this, not caused by this is good for white.

what do you think?

**
Yes, I think this result would have black still in the lead. White is not alive yet and is completely surrounded. Until the mistake in the corner later, you were certainly much better off than white.]
;W[eh];B[dg];W[ci]C[is there a way to keep black one piece here?

**
I don't believe so. However, there may be ways to limit the damage to the left side and upper side groups.]

C[is this the right way to attack this white group?


Yes. This is a very clever move to bring back potential life to the largeg black group. The only condition is that B4 is sente, which I don't think it really is, but white in the game does.]
;W[bn];B[bp]C[This move is not necessarily sente. The corner is small compared to killing the E15 (upper left side) group, because the E15 group is also cutting the center white group off.]

;B[er];W[gm]C[After this point, I don't think black has any chance at winning because white is so far ahead. The white center group is not really attackable because it is connected where the dead black group is. The only chance at killing it is to start a capturing race between the two, but it seems difficult to keep white from getting too many liberties.

I will stop comments at this move because the critical points in the game were earlier. In conclusion I would say that the only serious mistake in the game was the 3-3 corner invasion. Earlier in the game, near the beginning, the hane on the outside would be bigger than cutting (because of the size of the center, 120 vs. white 85 or so), but even without that black had a good game.

I hope I addressed your questions adequately in this review. If you still have questions, I'd be glad to answer them. Send them to ajnz1234@gmail.com.

I wish you luck with all your games,

they said, even this way is not good for black because b d11 group is weak. i dont agree since w f12 group is also weak and all around is black stones. what do you think?

**
It's true that the black stones are weak, but the only ones you really need to protect are the cutting stones (X). You can give up the three at the bottom (triangle). I think this is fine for black.]

Let's count and see.

With the marked boundaries I count white 85 points, maybe more.

To check:
Each letter represents roughly 10 points. 8 letters, and G in the lower right really has an extra 5.

See next for black points. It is not submissive since it is so big.]
