C[bougetu: Hi!
DwDf: hello

Dear reviewer!

This is a game I won on Pandanet by 6.5 moku. There wasnt much fighting, and it was close altough I cant see many mistakes on my part. I was losing till endgame and than I made a few moves I belive were quite good. Can you please comment it and point the weakness in my game? It would be great if you could tell me what literature to do or what games to study.

Regards,

Lovro Furjanic.

Hello, my name is Daniel and I'm 1-2 kyu on KGS. I added some notes for you. Major advice: don't stick to patterns, try to use your own understanding of the game, don't play moves that you don't understand. And always start from your weaknesses.

Also try to replay (on real board if possible) pro games (japanese pros 90s), this will improve your sense of shape and your understanding of Go.

I would also recommend to read fuseki books. Choose one fuseki (for example low/high chinese) and play 50 games using it, thus you will learn it.

If you have any Go related questions feel free to contact me via e-mail.

Best regards,
Daniel.];B[qd];W[dc];B[pq]C[I always do this with black

Daniel: Well, actually I would not recommend you to stick to one fuseki, especially this one. Komoku joseki are most difficult ones, so you should be ready for difficult games. As of myself I prefer to play komoku and hoshi as opening. The most important is that you should know how to use concrete fuseki, how to develop your position.]
;W[cp];B[ep]C[I prefer to kakari as soon as corners are taken. I know that R9 or Q9 would have been large. What other points of interest are there on the board?


Well, as I can see you are not really aware of this fuseki. As I know P17 is normal continuation for b. It's difficult to make 5th move wrong, it's just a matter of style or preference, to make shimari or to approach corner.
But R9 or Q9 are used for low and high chinese fuseki, when R16 stone is at star point.]
;W[gp];B[cq];W[bq];B[dq];W[bo]C[His shape is far from perfect.]
;B[gq];W[hq];B[gr]C[Maybe F3?

G2 is okey.];W[ip];B[oc]C[I know he has weakness but Im leaving it for later. He will now go Q5 and I will play O4

Shimari is very big. Yea, it's too early for attack.];W[fd]
C[Strange move.];B[qo]LB[ce:B][ci:A]C[Im more than happy to do two shimaries.

I would prefer invade his position A or B not to let him connect all stones in one frame because if you invade later it will be easier for him attack your stones. It's always a matter of time, good timing is a success to winning.]
;W[dj];B[ce]
(;W[jc]C[Wrong way of attacking.];B[ch]C[Also good for me I belive.

Yes, it's always good to make a base for weak group.];W[mc]
;B[pi]LB[pj:B][qj:A]C[Maybe R10 or 11. or Q10?

It's a rule to extend from shimari on 5 points. So A or B are best. B is preffered, because A gives low position for black.]
;W[ri]
(;B[qh]C[I tought for some time on this move. Im sure bnow that R11 was better.

Hard to say, but it looks for me you played in wrong direction.]

;W[qm];B[rn]C[This move and a few others were made under time pressure.


An advice I got from chinese 5 dan. When I studied Go, he said it's best not to play more than 3 games a day. Try to play fewer games but with longer time control and serious ones. This is the best way to improve.]

(;B[pf]C[Maybe too small. Im thinking about his weakness now.

Yea, it's too small. Always try to find an object for attack (not for kill).]

Yep, A is correct way of attacking. But you think in right direction.]

;W[mq];B[nq];W[kq];B[nr];W[mr]C[The result is very bad for black. White had 2 weak groups, now he has one strong and got points. And your corner is small.]
;B[br]C[if he doesnt answer, I go C6 and make great wall

Well the wall might be great, but that's not the point. The point is can you make your wall (thickness) effective.]

C[Im more than happy. His moyo is down too nothing and I have really thick position.

You need thick position for attack. Your wall actually is not working because you can't use it for attack. White has now strong groups. The problem is that you lost sente.]
