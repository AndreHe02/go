C[B: Hi, I'm Bart, around 7k on kgs and will try to review your game (white). My comments strart with B:]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[nc]LB[ce:A][pj:B]C[B: alternatives for black would be around A and B. A prevents you from making an extension and B gives black a nice framework.]
;W[ce]C[B: good, that's what black could have prevented. Because ot the low stone on O17, an alternative is to play C11 for a bigger framework.]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[dn];B[jq];W[ho]C[Didn't really know what I should do here. Never been in a situation where someone pincered me back.

B: yes, it's not an usual move. So you reaction to go out to the center seems ok.]
;B[dr]
(;W[cr]LB[cq:A]C[I don't like this move cause it weakens my right group

B: You're right group is not in immediate danger, but playing at A is a little better, because you don't have to worry about black playing there later on.]
;B[cq]C[B: ah. I did not look through the whole game, but are commenting on each move. So this is exactly my last comment.]
;W[dq];B[br];W[er];B[cs];W[eq];B[fm]LB[fo:A][ho:B]C[B: doesn't seem a good trade. It is hard to capture the black group A, and it threatens your white group B, while you traded this for the corner. See variation a few move back.]
;W[qn]C[Here I somewhat Tenuki. Maybe I should'Ve played a move with the weak groups

B: yes, around L4.];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[qk];B[lp];W[fr]C[Here I wanted to cut off the lower left stones and connect to my 2 endangered stones

B: good idea.];B[dl];W[el]LB[ne:A]C[I don't really like this move anymore. Don't know what I wanted to accomplish with it

B: agreed. It only works if there is a white stone around A or instead of the black stones there.]
;B[em];W[dm]
(;B[ek]LB[ne:A]C[B: if there was a white stone around A, the ladder would work and black would probably play F8, so you can play E9.]
;W[cl];B[dk];W[jc]LB[cl:A]C[Just play a big move on the board

B: yes, A didn't make any points with the bottom still open from the corner.]
;B[qg];W[ci]
(;B[fd]C[B: what happens if black would play C9 instead? The move black now did doesn't do much, I think.]

(;W[fc]C[Maybe a bit weak just to defend it? And I attach to a weak stone which shouldn't be done

B: your corner is quite safe, so it is better to defend the right stone. Maybe H17? See variation.]
;B[ed]
(;W[dd]C[B: Probably better to strengthen your stones on the right. See variation.]
;B[ec];W[eb];B[gc];W[fb];B[hd];W[hb]C[Here I see that he could cut of my weak stone, so I try to connect]
;B[ri];W[cp]C[Trying to pressure his small group in the corner. I think this was sente

B: yes, I think so too.];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq];W[jf]C[Maybe a bit far. This trys to attack his weaker stones on the left

B: yes, although I'm not strong enough to see an easy way for black to cut through.]
;B[ih]C[B: but that answer looks a bit too far as well.];W[ff]
C[Here I continue the attack while trying to build more territory

B: looks a bit loose, but I cannot see an direct way for black to attack. Although H14 looks promising.]

(;B[ck];W[bl];B[di];W[dh];B[cj]
(;W[bi]LB[dp:A]C[B: who not E11? Your A group is connected and safe.]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[eh];W[dg];B[ei]
(;W[hm]C[Does this stone accomplish anything?

B: it prevents black territory to become too big, but attacking black by playing H14 look better.]
;B[ld];W[jd]C[Maybe to weak? I was just really afraid

B: not weak, you're attacking black on the left side.];B[hf]
C[B: obvious respons by black.]
(;W[he]C[trying to cut off

B: that doesn't work. Try a peep at the cut, see variations.]
;B[ge];W[ie];B[gf];W[fg];B[gh];W[gl]C[He has to reply so I can play this - was my process of thought

B:true.];B[fl];W[gj];B[gi];W[on]C[THis seems big - way bigger than my previous moves

B: what if black plays there? How many points will black make? I think none, because the left side is still open and you have white stones there. So I think R17 is bigger.]
;B[qc]C[B: ah, that's what black thought as well.];W[lb];B[kg]
;W[oj]C[another Big Move to build a box

B: true. Another would be to try something at P3.];B[oh];W[kf]
C[If he gets this move black is too big on the upper right side

B: agreed.];B[lf];W[mj];B[li]LB[lg:A]C[B: N12 seems better for black. It also protects the cut at A.]
;W[lj];B[lm];W[mm]LB[mg:B][rq:A]C[Attachement to secure my territory

B: agreed. You can also consider: A is sente and gives you points in the corner. B is interesting as well.]
;B[mn];W[nn];B[ml];W[nm];B[ln];W[ll];B[kl];W[lk];B[jm];W[jo]
C[this just seems like a really bad move that can be cut (as shown later)

B yes, see earlier comment on alternatives.];B[ip];W[hp];B[io]
;W[in];B[jn];W[iq];B[jp];W[rj];B[qi];W[rq]C[Thought that this was big enough now

B: yes, I would even play it earlier.];B[rr];W[nb]LB[sr:A]C[and this, too

B: why not A first? I think black will respond.];B[ob];W[mc]
;B[na]
(;W[mb]C[B: now bad do you want to keep that stone at O18? See variation.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[me]C[just stretching into his territory while trying to cut off the M16

B: yes, idea is good. See earlier comment.];B[mf];W[le];B[ng]
C[B: no need for that, I think.];W[jg];B[kh];W[jh];B[ji];W[ii]
C[This cut can't work... Poor me

B: yep.];B[ij];W[ig];B[hh];W[hg]C[B: you cannot cut the bamboo. Leave it as a ko threat.]
;B[gg];W[mi];B[mh];W[jr]LB[sr:A]C[seems like one of the biggest moves out there

B: yes, and A.];B[kr];W[kq]C[B: you're right! Black had to respond at L3.]
;B[kp];W[lr];B[lq];W[ks];B[kq];W[is];B[mr];W[ls];B[ms];W[js]
;B[bn]C[Is there something he can do here?

B: no, don't see anything there.];W[ao];B[co];W[cn];B[ap];W[do]
;B[bj];W[ak]C[Just a bad response. Didn't see the atari

B: yup.];B[bh];W[bg];B[ai];W[ee];B[fe]

C[Is cutting off 1 stone really everything i can do?

B: yes, I think so.];B[no];W[es]LB[si:A]C[Doesn't accomplish a lot does it?

B: nope. See variation.]
