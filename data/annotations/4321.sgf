;B[qd]C[Hi. A game on KGS i ended up winning becouse white didnt notice a threat 
in the last moves. All in all it was quite a close game score wise thru the 
whole game. I've added some questions and comments. I'm playing black.Thank 
you for taking the time to comment on this 
game.];W[qp];B[dp];W[dc];B[oc];W[oq];B[qj];W[cn]
(;B[fq]C[vlkplk: Other responses instead of black F3 are possible. This actual one 
is very tight, but later black may have problems to get enough space for 
life. See later variation. For this reason, I usually prefer F4, or, in this 
actual situation G3.];W[bp];B[cq];W[ck];B[de]C[This ended up quite badly for me with the C9 stone nearby. Was this a 
outright bad move or didnt i just know how to follow upon whites response? 
Would J3 be considered too small at this point, or K16?

vlkplk: This is standard attack on white's corner stone. But resulting 
sequence didn't come out very well forblack. I will try to show some other 
suggestions for how to continue, but I'm not very sure whether they are 
correct...];W[cd]

(;B[qm]C[vlkplk: Certainly, R7 was big point, but black should first continue in 
upper left corner, so as to stabilize his group there and prepare for attack 
on white two stones K17 and N17, I 
think.];W[pg];B[qg];W[pf];B[qf];W[pe];B[qe];W[pd];B[pc]
(;W[jq]C[vlkplk: This move is realy annoying. My usual experience is, that when 
white is allowed one more move, B3, then black group at lower left is almost 
dead.Therefore I usualy choose to play G3 instead of F3. Otherwise black has 
now to play B3 himself.];B[mp]C[I felt i was behind in influense and was seeking to get somewhile closing 
white 
in.]

;W[bd];B[be];W[ib]C[White top left should be dead if black plays B18, even without the D16 
stone?

vlkplk: I think so. Lets see. Ofcourse, corner is big and you may try to 
kill it. On the other hand, black's stones at C3 are more weak than before. 
If white gets chance to play B3, they may be killed as well, I think. 
Decision about which is bigger is difficult, but it seems that lower left is 
larger than upper left.]
(;B[hb]C[vlkplk: What is purpose of this black's move? If territory-its too small 
to respond. Ther are certainly bigger points on the board.And there is no 
need to protect black upper right group. So, only meaningful play is to 
split and attack next, which black didn't...];W[en]C[vlkplk: White ignores black move at H18...]

(;B[dd]C[I knew it would forsure be dead if i now got B18, but white responded.

vlkplk: The point is not to kill for whatever it costs, but to surround and 
let live small. White responded and got some 5 points in corner, while black 
has perfect strong shape facing to the center and sente. No need to repent 
this result.];W[bb];B[eh];W[dg];B[eg];W[ig]C[vlkplk: Now, black almost lost the chance to attack upper-side white 
stones or white group at Q13.]

or so.];B[hi]C[During the next moves i try to make sure that white doesnt form a large 
moyo in the middle.

vlkplk: Right, but I think this was too deep. See 
variation.]

something like this move... But depending on white's answer, it may get a 
bit complicated. Reasons for playing black E17 instead of C15: 1)after C15 
and white's C12, black two stones are very weak and escape is only 
possibility, 2)trying to close white in from E17 direction can lead to 
large black moyo accros the upper-right 
area.]
