C[
kkkken: It looked like F5 was aiming to make territory on the left
side, but I don't feel it put enough pressure on F3 to have much
chance of success ?

This is a little unusual.  Normally black plays D6, followed by  W K4, or W D2, B C3, W J3.  Then
black plays around K 16 to make abig moyo.

But the strategy with the
Chinese style opeining is to haveW come in to the left side
and get an attack.  This move
invites W to invade at C6, and
attacking the weak group
there wins the game for B,
so F5 is pretty effective in the
end.];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[eq];W[ck];B[ei];W[fp];B[eo];W[ep]C[Better to just play around
J4 to stabilize your group.
Forcing black to play D5
weakens your group on the
other side.  And if you don't
play E4, the 3-3 invasion is still
possible later.];B[do];W[dq];B[cq];W[dr]C[
kkkken: I was unsure if D2 or E2 was better.  Seems that D2 makes
better shape, but it's sad to give B C2 in sente.

D2 (your play) is better.  If
you E2, he atari's at D2.
Connecting is horrible since it
makes your stones a big lump.
Cutting at C2 makes a big ko,
so you would probably just  extend around K4.];B[cr];W[er];B[ho]C[
kkkken: H5 seems like a nice point, but it seems to lack severity,  giving me time to defend my weak group.

I like H5.  It limits the lower
side territory and attacks the
W left side group.];W[fm]C[You need to defend on this
side now, but this move doesn't
work well.  E9 is better.

Remember to stay away from
strong stones.  The F5
stones are stronger than the E11

stone, so run near E11, not near F5.

The result in this corner
shows a common mistake.  You
captured one stone on the
lower side, but in exchange
made the left side group  weaker.  Always be careful
that gaining in one area doesn't
make another group weaker.
You lose more later defending theweaker group.];B[el];W[dj]C[Coming out this side gives
black a nice wall.  All
a consequence of your
earlier play on the lower
side.  By attacking the
weak group on the left
black will be able to take
territory in the upper left.];B[di];W[ej];B[fl];W[fj];B[em];W[en];B[gl]
;W[fi]C[Turning here may be sente, but
it forces black to secure a
large upper left territory.
Better to just jump out at
H10.];B[eg]C[
kkkken: I was pretty unhappy with this result --- B has territory and no
weak groups.  where did I go wrong here?

First the move at E4, weakening
the left side, then defending
at F7 rather than E9, then
turning at F11.

If black played E13 at D14
instead it would even clearer that
he had gained a large territory.];W[iq];B[bl]C[
kkkken: Looks like I defended the wrong group!

Agreed.  The lower side group
is alive.  The left side
group gets attacked again and again, and each time black makes
some more territory.

B makes an excellent move
here to take away white's
eyes.];W[cl];B[bn];W[bk]C[
kkkken: Maybe I should have B7 instead of B9?
(almost certainly considering what happened later..)

Yes!  After W b7, B a7, W c7
you are connected, and black
must play around B4 or you
capture some stones (starting
with w b5) and live.  So
B7 connects in sente.

Also, W b9 later is an atari,
and if B answers, then W A9
is atari, and you can  "reverse monkey jump" up to
W b12.];B[bm];B[bm];W[fh]C[Now B has a big lower left
corner and a big upper
left, and white has a heavy,
eyesless string of stones.
And the tail can be cut at
any time.

This weak, heavy group is
a burden for white for
most of the rest of the  game and causes W to  play conservatively, losing
points many times.  In the
end, it should have died.

Try very hard to avoid making
a group like this!];B[fg];W[eh]C[
kkkken: It seemed like a good time to cut, since
F11 group can run but D11 group can not...

There is no cut here.  B should
just play D13 instead of D12.

D12 makes an empty triangle
which is a clue that it is
a bad move.

If W plays D12 after B D13, then
B plays C12 and there is no
cut at C13.];B[dh]C[Big mistake, giving back the
upper left corner.];W[dg];B[cg];W[df];B[cf];W[de]
(;B[gg]C[B can push again at C15 to
keep some of the territory.
W is too short of liberties to capture the two stones in the
center, although white could
sacrifice the D15 group to
make a nice wall.];W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[bf];W[cc];B[bh];W[hi]C[
kkkken: H11 seemed to lack severity, but maybe it's hard to be severe
with the F8 stones so strong...

Your cut worked out quite well.
This move is good, defending
your weak group.  Imagine a
black stone here...

You want to attack the 3 stones
in the center.  Your lower
W group is weaker, so you
should attack from that side.

If you didn't have that weak
group, then attacking from
above would be better since
it could take territory.];B[fc];W[fe]C[
kkkken: I expected B to get a much worse result here than he did.  I
felt that I'd run over him by cutting these groups apart... but
somehow, it didn't happen... where did I go wrong?

He had about 30 points here
before your cut so you did
fine.];B[ig];W[he]C[This move is a little slow
since it lets B jump again
on the upper edge.  You
could try G17 instead.  If
he plays G18, don't crosscut
at F18 (he lives), but pull
back at G16.  While he struggles

to live on the top (maybe with
B H18, W J17, etc) you get
stones in place to attack the
4 stones in the center.  Also
after B H18, your peep at E18
works (unlike in the game).];B[hc];W[ji];B[if];W[ie];B[kg];W[ic];B[ib];W
[hb]C[
kkkken: Maybe this was wrong?  It helps B make nice shape... but I
couldn't find another move in the area that would shut him in and
connect me out.

This is good.];B[gb];W[jb];B[ha];W[jc]C[This result is good since
it starts toward a large
territory in the upper right.

Your group at F11 is in good
shape now with your two jumps,  and you can have fun attacking
the eyeless black group in the
center.

This weak black group is your
chance to take control of the
game by attacking.];B[pf];W[gd]C[
kkkken: I misread here, thought I could kill.  I'll fail again to kill
this group later.  :-)];B[gc];W[eb];B[db];W[cb];B[da];W[of]C[
kkkken: The goal here was to forego corner territory and divide the
Q14 stone from the L13 group ... didn't quite work...

The goal and the move are both
correct.  You go wrong later...];B[dd];W[cd];B[og];W[nf];B[pg];W[ng]C[Remember the principle of attack from the direction of your own
weaker group.  Your K11 group
is weaker than you O14 group,
so how about trying M12
instead (attack with the
knight's move).  If
W M12, B M12, W n12, B N13,
W O13, B is cut off and
might even die.];B[lh];W[li]C[
kkkken: I would have loved to O12 instead but I was afraid of K11
getting cut off.

You are right to be a little
afraid.  If you W O12, B J10,
W J11, B M 10 is pretty
severe.  But L10 or even
J9 is a better way to be sure
K10 gets out.

Again the weak left side group
keeps you from playing all
out.  Having an eyesless group
like this makes the whole
game hard for you.];B[nh];W[mi]C[This move is sente, but leaves
a cut behind at L11.  How
about N10 instead, which
also threatens to cut.  next
B N11, W O11, B N 12, W M10,
and you have a strong shape.];B[mh];W[pe]C[
kkkken: So I gave up, and decided to try to take some corner
territory, and make G13 struggle for eyes..

The corner is big, but since G13

is connected to Q13 now, getting
eyes on the side is not hard.

Maybe you could play L12 first
to secure your connection.

W L12, B K12, W L11, B J11,
W J10, B J12, W H10, B M14,
W Q15.  Or instead of ending
with Q15, you could try P10
for some potential in the
lower right.];B[ki];W[kj];B[kh];W[jk]C[The solid connection is stronger.
You should use the solid  connection unless you have
a good reason not to.];B[ij]C[
kkkken: oops.  guess K9 should have been K10?];W[ii];B[lj]C[You could play M9 and O9
before J9.  This would
connect out the K11 groups
and make a start on a wall
facing the lower right.];W[ik];B[mj];W[pm];B[pk];W[jo]C[This move is a little bit
too ambitious.  It doesn't
attack black, and the moyo
behind is very easy to invade.

I guess you were worried about
connecting out the K9 group.];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[lq];B[nn];W[or]C[
kkkken: was this move as bad as it looks now?  k7 or O8 look a lot
better to me now.

O8 or P8 look interesting.
K7 just connects on dame, so
it's slow unless your K10
group will die without it.

P2 is not so bad, since without
it b can play 3-3 later.  So
P2 takes lots of points.];B[pn];W[qn];B[om];W[po];B[on];W[ql];B[pl];W[qm]

here and capture the G10
stone, but it is a little
complicated.];B[gi];W[gh];B[gk];W[hh];B[gf];W[ge];B[ld]C[
kkkken: Ouch, this was a lot more painful than I expected.

This black move is excellent.
It's hard to find a good  response.];W[lf]C[I can't find any way to
capture the stone at M16.

So maybe W L16, B M15,

you could try N17 or
K19 followed by N17.];B[je];W[kf];B[jf];W[jd];B[hd];W[id];B[ke];W[lb]C[You might try K19.  If B
answers at J19, you can
play N17 and keep the whole

there is a big ko.

B M17, W M18, B N18, W O18,

kkkken: Costly misread for me here.  b did a nice job of beating me up
for it.

If you play P17, B P18, W O19,
B Q18, and black will probably
live in the corner.  And your
Q15 group wouldn't have two
eyes yet.];B[oc];W[pc];B[pb];W[pd];B[oa];W[lc];B[me];W[ja];B[ia];W[kd]C

the center.];W[ba]C[
kkkken: This move was supposed to be sente agains D19 group.  Another
misread..

Taking 1 point in gote here
cost you 5 or 10 points
elsewhere.

If you don't play here B gets
one point in sente, which is small
enough that you should save this
move for the endgame.

Even if you are pretty sure of
your reading, risking 5-10
points to gain one is a poor
gamble.

A move like O2 or M5 is pretty
big.];B[kp];W[jp]C[L3 would be bigger if you
didn't have to worry about
connecting to the K9 group.
Again that weak group cost you
points.];B[kq];W[lp];B[ko];W[nr]C[If you want to save the

better.  It makes a more
definite connection.];B[lo];W[lk]C[Since the white center group

territory around N8, but
that can't be helped.];B[kl];W[mk];B[nj];W[kk];B[jm]C[This might be better at J7

move).  for example:

B j7, W K7, B K8, W J8

kkkken: now how I wised I had connected C6 to C8 earlier...

(And you could have done it
with sente...).

You have to play this move at
H7.  Black can capture
your big group now.

Just like your move at K9
that should have been at K10,
the solid connection is
usually better.

After you play H7, you can
play G5 to capture the 3
cutting stones, or yuo
can captur ethe B group
at G8.

Even H8 seems to better
than G7, since after H8
you either make two eyes
or capture the 3 critical
stones.];B[hl];W[hm];B[fn]C[B should play J8 instead
of F6.  The B group has
6 liberties and can easily  win the fight against the  H7 group.  For example:

B J8, W F6, B C7, W G5,
B D7.

If white can't capture J5,
the W stones should die.];W[nk]C[You should play J8 first

After B plays C7 you can play
here.

If B cuts at J8 now your
whole big white group might die.];B[oj]C[
kkkken: Perhaps b should have J8 instead?

Yes.  J8 captures 5
stones, saves 3, and reduces
the bottom area, so it worth
almost 20 points.

And after J8, the whole white center group should die.

If B doesn't play P10 he loses
a few points around P11, but
not 20.  The O6 group doesn't
have two eyes yet for sure,
