C[kilroy [2d\]: hi

Hello, and thank you for reviewing my game. My questions are about my opening or about how I should counter strategy in this game.

[EV\] Hello, this is your reviewer.  My comments will be marked like this.]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[fugitive [2d\]: hi];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[nc];B[jp]
C[Black plays tenuki so I set up shape which meakes the moyo a bit harder and works well with D17, is this move too slow?

[EV\] The most common response to the W approach at O3 is probably a pincer like M17, but this move (K4) is also good.]

(;W[jd]C[[EV\] This move is a little unusal, but I don't see anything wrong with it.  Normally if B ignores the W approach move, W either takes the corner or double-pincers the B stone, and in either case B chooses a joseki to emphasize his right-side moyo.  See the variations for examples of the resulting game flow, taken from actual pro games.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[ci];W[qf]C[I go for the double pincer to start reducing his moyo is there a better choice here

[EV\] This move is certainly good.];B[nd];W[md];B[ne]
(;W[oc]C[[EV\] Jumping into the corner is also possible.  W should strive in the continuation to make K16 end up as a useful move, and B should try to make it over-concentrated.]
;B[pc];W[pg]C[I play these moves because I figure K16 helps my stones enough]
;B[qe];W[re];B[pf]C[this is all of the joseki I know, I had to read out what I would do next, I did look up the joseki and I didn't ready that If I atari at R16 then defend R16 cannot be captured.  Are there other joseki choices I should have considered?

[EV\] See the variation.]
(;W[qg];B[rd];W[ng]C[[EV\] The B corner is completely secure in this variation, so I would be disssatisfied as W.  On the other hand, W can later slide to S10, so maybe it is not so bad.]
;B[me]C[[EV\] Does B get a better result by cutting?  Try working out some variations.  Or can B get a more efficient shape by moving N15 to N16?  It looks like W must respond the same way to protect the cut.]
;W[ld];B[oh];W[og]C[[EV\] B has two ways to continue the attack from here -- block W from the center, or take away the W base.  It is hard to tell which is best at this point, so switching elsewhere is also quite reasonable.]
;B[lg]C[[EV\] This would be a great move if the W group above was not so strong.  As it is, once W settles his group on the right side, this stone could end up near W thickness accomplishing nothing.]
;W[rj]C[[EV\] Good.];B[rk]
(;W[ri];B[qk];W[sf];B[sd];W[mi];B[nh]C[[EV\] Pushing like this is bad when the cut is not possible.]
;W[mh];B[nj];W[mg];B[le]C[here I decide I must tenuki otherwise black will get too much, is it too early?

[EV\] Tenuki is fine here, since W cannot be enclosed with a single additional move.  However, if B does later manage to enclose the group, can W live inside?  Knowing the answer will help W decide on future moves.]
;W[pq]C[[EV\] This looks like a good invasion point, as it is hard for B to decide which side to block.]

(;B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[lk];B[ki];W[mj];B[nk];W[lm]
;B[lo];W[hq]C[Once again I tenuki because I fear that black may get too much too fast, is the tenuki good?

[EV\] I think tenuki is possible, but it really depends on how painful an attack B can devise, which again depends on reading the life-death situation on the right side.  A thick W move in the center would also be good, since W is not behind on territory.]
;B[kl];W[ll];B[jk];W[kh];B[kd];W[kc];B[ke];W[ic]C[[EV\] Nice forcing plays by B.]
;B[lh];W[kj];B[jj];W[li];B[ji];W[kk];B[jl];W[mk]C[which seems to be a mistake becasue I have to do this for a point, is there lighter play I missed after the peep?

[EV\] Were the last two W moves really needed?  Try really hard to avoid playing dame to live.  Things to consider:

1) Can W tenuki again?  If B takes away this eye, can W make two eyes on the side?  Or can B play on the side and reduce W to a single eye in sente?  (I think W can tenuki and still live, but try working it out and see if you agree.)

2) Or if W really does have to live inside now, are there any final forcing moves which could be taken first?  How about J5 to threaten to escape or N5, looking to escape or destroy some B territory before living or live in sente?]
;B[cn];W[dn]C[I chose this joseki becuase It effects black the greatest and I think would try and keep his moyo small, is there a better choice?

[EV\] Yes, you have to choose a joseki which reduces the B center.  This looks appropriate.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[fp]C[I would alos appreachiate any comments on this fight, F4 seems like an overplay to me, but why is it one?

[EV\] B is very thick here, with friendly stones stones in all directions.  It looks like F4 cannot be captured outright, so I think this is a severe attack, not an overplay.  

Maybe the best chance for W is to cut now, forcing B to decide how to answer -- see diagrams.]

I end here because I know there is no chance to kill now, did I miss a killing move? If possible can you give me any tips for things I should focus on improving? Any extra comments you are willing to give me would be wonderful. Thank you for your time.

C[[EV\] If B captures the cutting store, W gets to protect D5 in sente and can then do well on the other side.  This is a failure for B.]

(;B[ro];W[qo];B[rn]C[[EV\] B could contemplate this attack.  W cannot live in the corner, and B might get a good double attack.  Still, B loses a lot of territory if W manages to live with both groups.  I think I would try this attack as B if I was confident I could kill the upper W group once it was completely enclosed.]
