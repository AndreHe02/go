C[Hello,
the opponent has quite unusual fuseki, so i would like to ask review specially about this part of the game. Probably i could win without making two big mistakes in early yose but i would like to know how to make advantage after fuseki.]

(;B[cd]C[In our last game i have chosen d17, in both i had problem with white infleunce in center. This time i have choose d16 because after e16 i can play e15, and if white fallow joseki  f15, d15, f16, e17, f17 , e18 white is overcontrated. On the other hand now i have feeling that the direction was bad.

klin: In the modern games, there is no conclusion which direction is better.  Both are playable.]

[qi:B][ch:A]C[Now I didn't know what to play.
A is to near d15 and white will play b3 and c4 and kill the aji in b6.
E looks still to small.

I thought that after B white will play in q2 so i choose D.
But maybe i should play q2? On the other hand white could not answer in r3 but play r12 (and i really didn't want this)

klin: B is the smallest; E is big, but D is better.   (C after white D, playing at E is another possibility.)]

;W[ln];B[lo];W[rn];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]C[klin: B O2, white O1.  Now B Q1 is sente, the corner wont die.  So B can Q5, P6 cut.]
;W[cg]C[I think it was white's mistake - r12 was much bigger.]
;B[qi];W[mn];B[fb];W[eb];B[ec];W[gb];B[fc];W[gc]C[Probably most important moment - how to fight with whites center?? I was really afraid of white e13

klin: B K15 is a good choice.  But E13 is also a very good move.]

;B[ff];W[hf]C[It looks that white has many holes but i don't know how to get in (or take profit on attacking.

klin: First of all, B has to realize that W will have its territory.  Do not try to eliminate all.  For example, B P14, W O14, B O13.]

klin: It is close on the board.  It depends on the plays later.]
;B[bn];W[co];B[cn];W[dn];B[do]C[klin: B should play at B7 now. If W connect at D5, B C8 fight.]
;W[bm];B[en];W[dm];B[bo];W[an];B[cp];W[ao];B[co]C[klin: B gote.  This probably is the losinbg move. (no comments beyond this point)]
