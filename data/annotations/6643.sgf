C[- Hi. My name is Nhan Ho. I'm 6k KGS, and I played as white in this game.
- This game consists of alot of small fightings , beginning from the fuseki , and lasts for the whole game . For most of them , I think I didnt do well , so I just want to know where and how my moves can be improved. My opponent played many weird/unreasonable moves, and I failed to punish any of them .
- Also, I'd like to know if you can suggest me any book for further study .
- My English is a little messy, pls don't mind about that :) .
- Thank in advance .

Hello,
This game was quite hard for you, just from the begining you were behind in points. Your biggest problem was fighting i belive, you lose a lot(and could lose even more) in those close combat situations. I think that in same situation you didn't read much ahead, often playing moves that looks good, you should try to read ahead and see what will happen after each move before you play it(I would guess that in the first corner you didn't read much).

About overplays:

Never try to punish your opponents to much even if you think they made mystake, if you try to hard you may end up making same mystake and losing a lot, usually it is better to play strong moves against their overplays.

About books:

I would start with same tsumego book:  For your level i think book called 1001 life &death problems could be good start, also Tesuji by Davies is great book with tesuji which can improve your knowledge and reading by a lot, i would start with same of those.


I will mark my comments with [K\]:];B[qp];W[pd];B[dp];W[op]
C[I play the kakari because i'm having a hard time dealing with chinese fuseki .]
;B[pn];W[qq]
(;B[mq]LB[pp:B][rp:A]C[This is the first worst move (I think). And honestly, I dont know what to do next, so the next move is mostly an imitative move without any real reason .

[K\]: This move is odd.. black is trying to attack you 2 much.
He should play S3 (see variations).
But now white need to be careful when trying to punish.
B is the right move, see variation to check why.]
(;W[ql]C[[K\]: I am quite sure it is bad move, Q4 looks much better.]
;B[pq];W[pp];B[oq]C[[K\]:White is in trouble now.];W[qo];B[rp]
C[[K\]:Probably you  should give up R3 stone, see variation.]

(;W[rq]C[[K\]: Looks bad.. you can not capture black stones in here.]
;B[ro]C[[K\]: S3 was big mystake...
Now you can safe your stones in the corner but at really big cost, see variation.]

(;W[qn];B[po];W[rn];B[np]
(;W[dd];B[oo]C[The corner is big, so this is a total failure for me .]

(;W[pm]C[[K\]:Too slow! You should play fast as you are behind already.]
;B[qf]
(;W[qh];B[qj]C[Black move is aggresive but hard to counter, black is strong so he can fight, maybe you shouldn't choose this pincer.]

(;W[oj]C[Would P11 or P12 better than this move ?

[K\]:This is attacking move, i don't think you can attack when R8 and R12 are so weak.]

(;B[ph]C[[K\]:I think he made mystake here.];W[pi];B[of];W[pg]
;B[oh]
(;W[pf]C[[K\]:This is bad :(];B[qg];W[og];B[qi];W[rh];B[pe]
;W[ng];B[qe];W[nh];B[od]C[[K\]:I think you can not live in corner directly, but you can reduce it by a lot. See variation.]

(;W[qc];B[oc];W[rc]C[Is is possible for the corner to live now ?
 
[K\]:I am quite sure it is impossible now.];B[pb];W[rd]C[[K\]:Bad shape and move, only helping black to get more points.]
;B[rg]C[[K\]:Black is so happy to get this move for free.
Later he can connect with T12 now so you only damaged yourself.]
;W[ra]C[Oh.. dead in gote!]
(;B[qb]C[[K\]: Black could tenuki and finish you off now. See variation.]
;W[pr]C[[K\]:Losing ko treats, not worth to play it.];B[rr]
;W[sq];B[qr];W[sr];B[sp]C[Up until now , I think I'm on the way to gain back the lost in the lower right corner

[K\]:I disagree, you are losing by a lot, black to 2 huge corners and white got almost no points, if not black mystake at R18 game would be over already.]

(;W[iq]C[[K\]:Bad point for invasion, F3 area seems better.]

(;B[fq];W[lr];B[lq];W[kr]C[Does the 3 moves exchange good for me ?

[K\]:Not really, you still have no base and black gained F3 for free.]
;B[kq]C[[K\]:This is quite slow move by him you have chanse to run now.]

(;W[cp]C[[K\]:For sure this move is overplay, white can take corner but his group at outside looks  terrible after it.]

(;B[cq];W[do];B[ep]
(;W[eo]C[[K\]:Bad. B5 is probably the best shape.
Now black should just capture i think.]
(;B[fo]C[[K\]:This is also good for him.]
(;W[em]C[[K\]:I think this is bad shape for you, what if he just capture?]

(;B[kd];W[gc];B[ic];W[fn];B[ck];W[go];B[fp];W[ch]
(;B[cn]C[[K\]:You are really lucky here, black overplayed by a lot, see variation on what he could do.]
;W[co];B[cm]
(;W[dm]C[[K\]:So slow! You missed great chanse to attack him!
See variation.];B[dj];W[eh]C[[K\]:This is just wrong dirrection, your big hope is center, you shouldn't ask black to run into it! and that E12 move is not protecting corner, black can still make life there by playing C17.]
;B[fj];W[bj]C[Is this move a mistake , should i continue to jump at G12 or G11 instead ? At first , i thought this is a normal move- not good, not bad . But after black play G12, i think it's a completely bad move .

[K\]:Yea it is definetly 2 slow.];B[gh];W[fi]C[[K\]:Cutting here is good idea, you have to fight to get back into game.]

;B[cg];W[bh];B[bi];W[cf];B[bg];W[bf];B[ah]C[[K\]:Same sacrifice... Well black got so many points here that you need to get really big center or kill him, B3 or H4 are just huge!]

(;W[fd]C[[K\]:Wrong! See variation.];B[eb];W[ee];B[fb];W[gb]

[K\]:Yes it is, white made mystake here.];W[ac];B[ab];W[bb]
;B[ad];W[cb];B[db];W[ae];B[ba]
(;W[hg]C[Instead of this move , should i invade directlly somewhere around N16 ? .

[K\]:Maybe that is same idea, however you can't reduce black by a lot there, see variation.

But for sure you should try to take more, anything to build big center would be good.]
;B[mr];W[jq];B[nf];W[mf];B[kf]C[[K\]:Black overplayed here so you got a lot of points from him.]

(;W[sn]
(;B[rk]C[I was wondering why my opponent play S9 and S8, and that lost me the game :) .

[K\]:This move is terrible! He is just hoping for you to make mystake.]

(;W[gr]C[[K\]:Good idea, white group is not yet alive here.]
;B[gq]
(;W[hq]C[[K\]:This is very weak move :( You should extend to H2.]
;B[fr];W[jo];B[km];W[hm];B[df];W[eg];B[im];W[jl];B[ko];W[hs]
;B[bq];W[bp]C[[K\]:So small! Now black just need to finish you at T12..]
;B[sh]C[[K\]:Game over...
So about game, you made many mystakes in the begining that gave black huge lead.
For sure you need to work on your reading, result at bottom right corner is terrible, big mystake at S19 to - he made mystake because you killed yourself in gote! And few more mystakes that were made because of reading( I guess you missed tesuji at T12).
Ofcourse you also menaged to get same points back but lost from the start was just too big!

So for sure a lot of work on reading should be your priority. And same problems about invading, direction of play or shape  can't be bad as well. 


Hope I helped a bit.
Have a good day!])
