AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[pete [15k?\]: Hi!

Pete - I thought at the time I was playing a good game.  But, things unraveled as it went along.  Hoping to learn as much as I can from reviewed games.]
;W[kj]C[tjl [2d\]: terve

Pete - Looks to me he's giving me more than 9 stones.

Nothing that W wouldn't do in a handi-9 game.  The only hope W has is to play overplays and hope for B couldn't punish them and makes mistakes along the play.

It'd be impossible to comment move by move, i'll just do it from a conceptual point of view.]
;B[bj]C[Principle: Gold Corner, Silver Side, and dummy center.  Keep your stones connected with others.

Build your fortification from the corners and then extends to the sidelines.  C4/D3 kind of move is better than move on the sidelines.]
;W[ji];B[cf]C[R9 or J10 is better.  Once B R9/J10, W has a cutting point at L11.  Think of "number of soldiers" in the center: you have two "connected" ones against two separated ones --- you've the advantage.]
;W[ij];B[jk];W[jm];B[dm]C[Again, corner over the side.  Plus, you need to strength the center stones unless you want to give them up.]
;W[jr];B[nq];W[fq];B[eq]C[Pete - I'm wrong, but thought I had alot of territory on the lower right.  4th line is influence, so I don't.]
;W[cm];B[co]C[pete - So, I cover the corner and pray

C6, twist with W.  B have many stones against one W stone.  Being defensive gives W many chances.]
;W[dl];B[dn]C[E7.  Again, you've more influence than W, use it.]
;W[ck];B[cj];W[fl];B[fj];W[db]C[E18 or D17.  Look around D16, where is B's "weaker" side?  Many stones at right already, so R16 is the weaker spot.  Therefore, it's OK to give up the corner (the C14-C10 group is solid) and build some influence to help R16.

Say, B E18 E17 D17 F18 C18 E19 R17 -- W gets one stone and live the side, B have the corner and strengthed the R17.

Or B D17: if W C18, B E18 -- W gets corner and B get the upper side; or if W E18, B C18 -- similar as the above paragraph.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[fc]C[This move is confusing...  C17 was to defense the corner, and F17 for the side?  A contradiction or inconsistence for B.  If B wants the corner, B18 is the move, if side is desirable, why C17 to start with?  Make sure the stones are working together for one purpose.

GO is one play per person, plus W is much much stronger, B couldn't expect to have everything -- give up some, and gain elsewhere.]
;W[bc];B[bd];W[dc];B[cd];W[ec];B[fd];W[ed];B[ee];W[fb];B[gb]
;W[gc];B[hc]C[Pete - bad move.  G16 better?  Influence over greed?

How about H18?  Aji is bad, but no problem at all -- thanks to R16 (please try to read out the secquence on your own, very good practices for beginner).]
;W[gd];B[fe];W[hb];B[ic];W[ib];B[jb];W[kc];B[jc];W[nc]C[Pete - Need to get back to G15 soon]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[he];W[ge];B[gf];W[ga];B[hf];W[ff];B[ef];W[fg]
;B[eh]C[G12 -- F14 is way too much of an overplay, B needs to punish it.  W's liberty is very tight, and B has way too many stones around -- nothing to afraid of.]
;W[gh];B[gg];W[fh];B[eg]C[J12 or M17 -- R16 group is getting surrounded...  Better watch out.]
;W[hh];B[hd]C[pete, should have m14 or so instead?];W[gb];B[kd]
;W[lc];B[ld];W[md];B[ma]C[pete - wrong side?  n15?

What does N18 do?  Why play this move?  What is B want to achieve with this move?  These are the questions to better understand your own move and knowing "why" helps you discover mistakes better.]
;W[nb];B[ob];W[na];B[oa];W[pe];B[qe];W[qd];B[qc];W[rd];B[rc]
;W[od];B[pc];W[qf];B[re];W[rf];B[sd];W[of]C[Watch out what W just did....  W "gives up" two stones (R16/S16) to build up inflence; it's the preparation to "attack" -- hopefully to "kill" -- the R16 groupe.  R16/S16 is small, R16 is big -- lose some here, and gain elsewhere.

Up to this point, B has lost about half of the handi advangage already.  Good point to stop.  Please see the end of game for a general comment.]
