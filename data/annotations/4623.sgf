C[Hi!

This game was a total desaster for me, got spanked pretty bad ;). I hate close fighting and i especially hat cuts! So this game started strange for my liking, since we got into fighting so early when usually i wanted to play more opening moves around 3rd and 4th lines. I would love to know how I could have defended better and also where I could have attacked w correctly.

Thanks

Hello, I will be doing the review.  I will begin all future comments with S.  Cutting is part of the game.  You'll have to learn how to defend against them and know when to make them yourself in order to get stronger ^_^]

(;B[dq]C[here i tried to attack the corner a bit to build up shape and then i wanted to attack g3, but that's not how it went ...

S: This move is a bit slow.  If you want to attack g3, the best option is to first cut it off from the stones on the left.  Jumping out at E5 or F5 would probably be best.  Then by attacking g3, you will gain thickness to use against the stones on the left.

If you want to attack the corner, this move only helps white.  See variations]

(;W[jq];B[kq];W[iq];B[cq];W[fr];B[bp]C[so by  now i really tried to get the corner]
;W[co]C[S: only play inside your own territory to make eyes when you have no options left.  It's very slow and usually gives the opponent sente.  Your best option right now is to jump out into the middle.  Not only to escape, but to seperate the 2 white groups as well since the 1 on the left is far from alive.]

(;B[br];W[er];B[fo]C[S: Good move.];W[fm];B[ho];W[ip];B[jo]
C[My thought: Stay alive in the left corner (of course just worth a few points) and build thickness along k to secure lower right side. Was this a correct move then?

S: Your group was alive to alive to begin with, so no concern there.  See variations.  Builfing thinkness along K is a good idea, but I doubt it will help you much to secure the lower right.  It's a bit too far and the right side is way too open.  If you had maybe 1 more stone at q10, it may work. 

Another good option would be to take away the base from white at c8.  You make eyespace and force the left group to run.]

(;W[io]
(;B[fp]C[S: protecting the cut is not as important as keeping the groups seperated.  H6 or H7 would be a solid move.]
;W[dr];B[fq];W[gr]C[S: bamboo joint is stronger, but jumping out here is best.  H6 or H7 again]

(;B[gp];W[hp];B[hn];W[gn];B[fn];W[gm];B[do]C[S: Always look to escape before making eyes.  Connecting at g5 is best.]
;W[go];B[en];W[cn]C[S:  Cutting at e7 is huge.  Not only is is sente, you do not want white to have a huge connected wall facing your lone d10 stone.  Not only that, you do not need the eye at e4 to live.  see variations]

(;B[dp];W[cr];B[bo];W[bn];B[aq]C[S: not necessary to live];W[in]
;B[qj]C[i wanted to play moves like this all the time, but HE started the fighting ;)

S: Yes, we all hate fights that we dont want to fight ^_^.  Unfortunately, sometimes we have to fight.  At this point, the 2 stones are huge.  Allowing white to connect his 2 groups for free is a huge mistage.]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[ql];B[pk];W[pl]C[S: It may look dangerous but you need to hane here to put more pressure on the group.  You have stones around to help, so being cut will not be as dangerous for you as it will be for him.]

(;B[ok];W[rk];B[rj];W[rp];B[rq];W[ro];B[pn];W[qn];B[po];W[ol]
;B[nm];W[nl];B[mm];W[hc]C[S: It's not a total loss for you.  True the group live, but you secured the corner, maybe some terrietory in the center, and potential for a large moyo on the right side.  The key now is to not left the stone d10 die or white will take a huge moyo.  Cuttting at e7 is big now.]
;B[jc];W[ie];B[je];W[lc];B[kd];W[ld];B[le];W[od];B[qf];W[ci]
;B[cj];W[bj];B[bk];W[bi];B[cl];W[em]C[S:  Too late, he got there first.]

(;B[cm];W[dn];B[ei];W[ek];B[dk];W[dl];B[bl]C[S:  No point in trying to make eyes here.  The most you will make is 1 and it is unlikely that you will get even that.  Running is the only option.]
;W[ak];B[al];W[aj];B[an]C[my bad. i knew c9 is not an eye, but i thought a6 made a safe connection. as you know and we'll see later this is not the case ....

S:  yes, connecting on the first line leads to many complicated and usually sad results.]
;W[di];B[ej];W[fk]C[S: 1 space jump is faster and cannot be cut in this situation.]

(;B[fh];W[if];B[jf];W[me];B[lf];W[pc];B[qc];W[qd];B[pe];W[rc]
C[S:  Ouch, you fell for his trap.  Lost alot here.  As you get better, you'll be able to read a few more moves ahead and see that this is an overplay by white.]

(;B[qe]C[see variation];W[qb];B[rd];W[qc];B[re];W[oe];B[of]
;W[nf]C[S: although scary to play, the double hane here is fine.]

(;B[og];W[ng];B[nh];W[oh];B[ni];W[pg];B[pf]C[until now i felt totally safe and never thought this group could get into trouble]
;W[ph]
(;B[pi]C[i played  this move because it looked like double purpose to me: take away a liberty  and start an eye around q10 for the other group.

S: The best move is s12 to connect your group out.  There is no way for the 3 white stones to run away, so once the r15 group connects out, the white group is dead.]
;W[rg];B[qg];W[qh]
(;B[oi]C[okay,  i gave up on that group

S:  That's too bad.  You had a way to live.  Although dont feel too bad you didn't see it.  It's a rather tricky tesuji.  See variation.]
;W[rh];B[mg];W[rf];B[mf];W[ne];B[qi]C[S: No need to play this move.  White shouldn't even respond here.  You should take this chance to reduce the upper white territory a bit.]
;W[sd];B[mk];W[ml];B[ll];W[jb]
(;B[kc]C[S:  Empty triangle.  Usually a bad idea. L18 is the correct move.]
;W[kb]C[S: Your next few moves are aji-keshi.  You helped white fix his weakness and you got almost nothing out of it.  You could have exploited those holes to possibly invade the territory.  I left some variations that could possibly have been done.  They're rather complicated, so dont worry about the actual sequence of moves.  What I want you to get from this is that it is really bad to let the opponent connect his stones like this.]

;B[ih];W[fg];B[eh]C[S: e13 is better.];W[gh];B[gi];W[hh]
(;B[ij]C[S: h11is the correct move.  It sets up the double atari at h14, so white must protect.]

;W[he];B[gf];W[gg];B[ge];W[gj]C[now the trouble starts

S: giving up the stone and playing at a7 was the correct move.]

(;B[fi];W[fj];B[ck];W[am];B[bm];W[am];B[ii];W[ao];B[ap];W[an]
;B[bs]C[at this time i gave up

S:  You did pretty well until the endgame.  Once you helped him secure the upper left corner it was pretty much over.  

The main thing you need to work on is reading.  Life and death problems are great for that.  Just being able to read a few more moves ahead will really improve your game a lot.

As a little challenge to you,  there is a move that you can make that will kill the white r5 group.  See if you can figure it out.  I'll put the answer down as a continuation of the game, but dont look until you try and figure it out on your own!
