C[nosoup4you: hello

Anton> Hi, redlead. Thank you for the honor to review your game, I will try my best to help you. My rank is around 10-12k (in different systems :)). Please don't be offended if some of my comments sound harsh - I only wish to point you to the areas where you could improve. Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions or comments - I will gladly continue to discuss this game with you.

The general areas where you need to be careful at are:
1) Don't follow your opponent around. Decide for yourself where the important points are. Not all moves need to be responded to immediately - there are often far more important moves waiting to be played.
2) Before making every move, look around the board to find opponent's weak points. There are cases when you could administer serious damage - and missed your chance.
3) If you are not sure where to play next, make sure you connect your stones as much as possible, and separate the opponent's stones.
4) Try not to start small fights - stronger opponents will just ignore them and occupy the whole board instead.
4) Don't be afraid to sacrifice stones if you see that you can gain more as a result.

In the following comments I will try to highlight these areas of improvement in the specific situations.]
;B[dq]C[redlead: hi];W[dd];B[pp];W[do];B[fq]C[Anton> This move by black is a little too low, I would play F4 instead - especially since there is a black stone at Q4 already.]
;W[jp];B[qd];W[od];B[qf]C[Anton> Same comment, playing on the 3rd line is safer, but in the beginning of the game you need to be ambitious to stake out more influence. I would play Q14 in this situation.]
;W[pj];B[pm]C[Anton> There is no direct threat on the lower right corner yet, so black may have used this opportunity to occupy one of the remaining sides - either the top or the left one (the board had symmetry up to this point, so doesn't matter which), - at K16 or D10.

Though locally move at Q7 isn't bad.];W[qq]C[After white 12, what would have been a good move for black?

Anton> Previous move at Q7 on the 4th line was directed more towards outside influence instead of the inside territory. For black it is efficient to use the stones in the way they are placed - so it would be good to play Q3. This allows white to live in the corner and along the right side (white R4 - black R5 - white S5 - black R6 and so on) while building a very strong black wall facing the lower side. Then, if you still have the initiative, a black stone around F6 could be played - this would threaten both the stones at K4 and at D5.]
;B[qk]C[Anton> This move ultimately allows white both settle in the corner and take the outside influence - thus black lost their chance to bargain for one of the two. Please keep in mind that Go is like a game of trade - you have to offer something to get something back. Both not offering anything at all and offering for no good profit will lead to defeat in Go (and in life :)).]
;W[qj];B[rj]C[Anton> Locally, S9 is better - it safely closes the entry from the top for white, and if white does move to S10 - black is not worried about the bottom group, and can protect the top group instead.

Globally, this move is not very meaningful, since white can still invade from the bottom stone R3. If for black the territory around R6 is important (though it is not that big for this stage of the game!), closing at R4 would be better. Yet I would allow white to settle here, and play Q3 instead, as I said in the earlier comment.]
;W[ri];B[rh]C[Black 17 at S12 was wrong.  I think connecting at S9 would have been better.  Is that the best way to save black 15?

Anton> Don't worry about single stones, if you can get more points for sacrificing them. S10 can be sacrificed easily - and in return you get protection of territory for both the top and the bottom groups. So, S12 (or even S13, to be less spread out) is okay. When white plays S9 - just play S8 and leave it at that. If white decides to take the stone - you can use the obtaine initiative elsewhere.

Connecting at S9 now would not be a good idea - white can then start sliding under the black stones at R14 and R16, thus forcing you to struggle for life - never an advantage when you are forced to do it.]
;W[rk];B[ql]C[Anton> I think S8 would also work, and it would force white to respond.]
;W[ro]C[Anton> Unfortunatelly now you see that protecting from the top while the bottom is open is futile.]
;B[md];W[pc];B[qc]C[trying to protect the corner

Anton> This is a good move, especially since black stone at N16 negates any influence that white may gain while attacking the upper-right corner.]
;W[of];B[mf]C[trying to contain white, preventing access to the center.  Is this a good approach at this point?

Anton> Yes, this is good thinking. You gain advantage while forcing white to connect. The next logical step after white's forced reponse would be to attack the upper-left corner by playing around F17 - this would extend from the influence of black stoner N16 and N14. Unfortunatelly, black misses this opportunity.]
;W[oh];B[pg]C[Black 27 was an attempt to protect the right side. Was it a good move?

Anton> Sorry, but I cannot see any value in this move. It just forces white to connect - yet doesn't gain anything for black. It would be better to leave the white stones unconnected now, and then use this semi-weakness ("aji") later to gain some profit. The current move, as it stands, if "aji-keshi" - destroyer of opportunity.]
;W[og];B[nb]C[sliding a bit into the corner and hoping to prevent white's expansion

Anton> This is not a good move for this stage of the game. Think about the whole board, do not get locked into the local situations. Much bigger moves now are F17 (as discussed in an earlier comment) and C11 - to occupy the left side. Or even be bold and play C8 - attack the white stone D5 and then expand along the left side.]
;W[nc];B[mc];W[ob];B[na]C[Would it have been better to play black 33 at O16 and force white to connect?  Or maybe playing at R18 would have been better?

Anton> These are all very local moves, and are too early - there are bigger points on the board to worry about (see an earlier comment). Especially F17 is becoming important, since the black wall at N17 keeps growing.

Playing locally is important only if:
a) One of your groups is being threatened, and action needs to be taking to keep it alive.
b) One of the opponent's groups can be attacked with the purpose to kill it.
c) It is close to the end of game, and you are gaining additional points of the territory.

None of the above is happening right now, so look for other places on board which could be more important to play at.

Locally, though, N18 is better than O19 - it is more reliable, as it does not allow white an easy further development with initiative (you repeat the mistake of O19 throughout the game - it is not a very big mistake, yet still something to think about).]
;W[qb];B[rb]C[Anton> Good and timely move.];W[nd];B[pe]C[Anton> I don't see why this move was needed. Please make sure your moves matter.]
;W[oa];B[lb];W[nf];B[iq]C[Decided to expand on the bottom.  Would it have been better to remain focused on the right side?

Anton> It is high time to get distracted from the right side and look at the whole board. Though bottom side is not very high on the priority list. If you would like to play here, though, it would be good to start with Q3, and then, after the corner sequence is played out, jump out around F6 - as discussed in an earlier comment.]
;W[jq];B[jr];W[kr];B[js]C[Anton> More reliable to play at J2.]
;W[lq];B[nq]C[Black 47 was an attempt to keep white seperated and to connect with black 3.

Anton> O3 does not attack strongly enough either of the two white groups involved. I would play at Q3 instead - white has to do something about the corner in this case, and white groups are separated for good. Also note that O3 and Q4 are not really connected, and additional action is needed to connect them. It is better to play solid, definite moves, instead of half-measures - and O3 is a half-measure, as it tries to do a lot, and does not achieve any of the goals.]
;W[or];B[oq]C[Was black 49 at P3 good?  Are there better alternatives here?

Anton> P3 does not separate the white stones - though it does connect the black ones. Locally I would try to be more agressive and play at O2. Though globally attacking the lower right corner should be left alone for now - white is firmly established (mainly thanks to black's efforts, I am sorry to say this).

I would be concerned about survival of the black group in the lower right - and either try to get a base by playing S8 and then S6, or start escaping around N7.]
;W[ks];B[ir];W[nr];B[pq]C[Anton> This move takes one point from white, and, as we will see later, does not get any points for black. So even though it is "sente" (keeps initialtive for black), it should be left for later. There are move important moves on the board.]
;W[pr];B[qp]C[Anton> Good move. It is different from the previous one - it forces white either to surrender some points (if white plays S3), or to put themselves into an awkward situation (if white plays S4). If white ignores this move - black pushes through at S4 and gains a lot.]
;W[rp]C[Anton> White chose the awkward situation - probably does not believe that black can punish for this, and is relaxed (unfortunatelly, it is correct perception by white). Yet please note the weakness ("aji") at S3 - you could use this later in the game to get a lot of points.]
;B[rn]C[Black 57 at S6 appears wrong.  I'm thinking R5 might have been better.

Anton> I believe this move is not bad - it starts a sort of a base for black on the right side, and white can still be stopped if they push through at R5 - this is what actually happened.]
;W[qo];B[po];W[qn];B[rm];W[qm];B[rl];W[sj];B[pn];W[qh]C[Anton> Please look at the whole board. White move at R12 is serious and should not be ignored without a reason - yet it does not kill the black group yet - while the group in the lower right is without base and can be easily surrounded and killed. I would seriously consider saving it before doing anything about the upper right group, which is in danger of being reduced - yet not being killed (yet!).

You have to be very careful about such choices, as they may cost you a game if you misjudge the relative cost of the moves or ignoring moves - yet such choices are part of the beauty of Go! When your opponent sees you ignoring their moves - they worry that you know something they don't. This takes the game to a whole new level.]
;B[qg]C[Was 67 at R13 a mistake?  Would Q12 or S13 have been better?  Upon reviewing this, I think S13 would have protected the stone at S12 and kept the black stones connected.

Anton> Locally this move is okay. If you played S13, white R13 would threaten both cutting off the stone at Q13, and reducing the black group (again) by playing T12 - you won't be able to respond T13 (white S14 gets three black stones and more territory from black) and will need to retreat to T14 instead.]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[sh];B[sf]C[Anton> It is better to play at S19 in this situation - white S19 could threaten to kill the whole black group.]
;W[cq];B[id]C[instead of responding to 72 in the lower left, I choose to try to expand on the top with J16

Anton> Good thinking, but try to extend as far as possible from your thickness - in this case, F17 is a very good move, both attacking the white D16, and extending from the black wall at N17.]
;W[gc];B[hc]C[Anton> Black group is not in direct danger, bigger point is to play on the left side - around C10.]
;W[dj]C[White took the whole left side.  Maybe I should have tried to prevent that somehow.

Anton> Correct. You need to be careful not to get too involved into small local fights while there are still big points on the board. Yet please note that white did not yet "take" the whole side - the stone at D10 is just a claim that needs to be supported by more stones to be turned into actual territory. There are sill many ways to invade or reduce this area - when you see loose ambitious frameworks like this ("moyo"s) do not give up. Some of the ways to invade - C17, C16, C10 (there may be more that I don't see at my level). Some of the ways to reduce - D14, D7, F10 (there are definitely more that I don't see).]
;B[le]C[Anton> I cannot see a reason for this move, it supposedly protects a possible cut at N15, yet if you feel that this cut is dangerous it would be more reliable to just close it and play N15. Remember - good solid moves are much better than half-measures, which have many goals yet achieve none of them.]
;W[fo]C[Anton> Notice what white is doing here - expanding the "moyo" on the left side while attacking the black group on the bottom side. The problem with this move is that is does not look too threatening to the black group - so you could have ignored the threat and start invading the "moyo" by playing C14, for instance.]
;B[ep]C[Anton> I cannot see much value in this move. It forces white to strengthen their stones - this is another case of "aji-keshi" - destroying opportunity. Even E6 would be better - white may feel threatened and close the gap at E5, and black will have a stone "across" the white wall, to start destroying the "moyo" with.]
;W[dp];B[eq]C[Anton> If you are worried about white atari at D2 - it would be better to play D2 yourself, thus also gaining some territory.]
;W[eo];B[gp]C[Anton> To make this group safer it is necessary to build a base for it. C2 is a good move for this, as it will be difficult for white to stop (black C2 - white B2 - black B3 atari - white C4 - black A2 atari).]
;W[cr];B[go]C[Anton> I wouldn't ignore the previous move by white, for a group it is better to build a base and then extend, instead of having to run away with no base at all. I would play D2 here.]
;W[fs];B[gr]C[White invaded.  Was G2 an appropriate response?

Anton> Yes, it seems to be the only reasonable response in this case if you wish to keep the base for your stones - which is very important.]
;W[jn];B[io]C[Anton> Continue pushing at G6 - this is a very good move since it reduces white "moyo" very effectively. J5 does not seem to have much value in this situation.]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[in];B[hn]C[Anton> G6 is still better.];W[jl]
;B[jo]C[Anton> I cannot see much value in this move, sorry.]
;W[ko];B[ho];W[km];B[hf]C[Anton> This is good thinking, the task now is to reduce the white "moyo" on the right side. Though more agressive play is required, since black is behind and has a lot of points to catch up. I would play the earlier stated invasion or reduction moves.]
;W[pk];B[pl];W[no]C[black ultimately fails to make the large group of stones on the bottom right live.

Anton> Please note there is still black S3 potential to use, established by earlier forced play by white. Check the sequence - black S3, white T3, black R3, white S2, black R3, white T4, black S1. I think it saves the black group.

If I am right, still you could not see this potential, and I think that you could have avoided bringing this group to such a bad state. This group attempted to occupy the corner first, then to establish outer influence, then to get a territory on the side, then to split the two white groups - I believe that if black were consistent in using these stones, they would survive and be very useful in the game.]
;B[mm]C[Anton> If you believe that the stones are dead - it is better to sacrifice them yet still use their potential. Black could play M11, for instance - this threatens to connect to the dead group and make it alive - while expanding the presence of black stones in the centre. It is just an idea, you can see how even dead stones can be useful.]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[mj]C[Anton> Now white increased their presence in the centre, while black is trying to win a lost cause.]
;B[mn];W[mo];B[mp];W[lo];B[mq];W[mr];B[lp];W[kp];B[on];W[ol]
;B[om];W[ok];B[ph];W[pi];B[sl];W[rq]C[Anton> Now white noticed the risk and removed the weakness.]
;B[sg]C[Anton> S19 is still important for survival of this group. T13 is a one point move which also starts a ko - so white could even ignore this move for now.]
;W[rh];B[sk]C[Anton> I cannot see any meaning of this move. It could serve as a ko-threat, yet otherwise it is just playing from the dead group.]
;W[rj];B[qa]C[Anton> Good.];W[pb];B[pf]C[Anton> I can't see a reason for this move. If white plays Q14 - black closes at Q16. For white Q16 black responds with Q14, therefore the point at R15 is black territory unconditionally. And there are bigger moves on the board (white "moyo" on the left to invade or reduce) than fighting for a single point in "gote" (giving up initiative).]
;W[ll];B[gd];W[fc];B[gb]C[Anton> G18 is too small for now - and calls for white F18, to which black will feel like responding (though it is not necessary at this point). With the black stones which are now in the central area, I would play around D14 to reduce the white "moyo".]
;W[fb];B[ga]C[Anton> H18 would be better. Though I would really ignore the threat for now. If white does decide to atari at H18 - then atari back at J18 and use the resulting initiative to deal with the white "moyo".]
;W[fa];B[fd]C[Was F16 wrong?  The two black stones G19 and G18 ultimately get captured (see move 154) because they were never connected to H17.  Should I have played H18 or J18 as move 137 instead of F16?

Anton> I believe that starting the small fight with G18 was wrong, the rest of the moves are sort of "it will look funny if I stop it now, since I started the fight" moves. Yet even if you realised a little late that the fight is small - it is not late to ignore it and play a bigger move. Though F16 is not the biggest out there (I like D14 better).

Generally - don't be afraid to sacrifice your stones if you get more in return. Just don't sacrifice the stones without any return.]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[cc];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cf];B[cg]C[Anton> Because of white stone at D10 it would be better to just continue along the 4th line.]
;W[dg]C[Where should black play to save C13?  or is it a lost cause?

Anton> You can try something like atari D12 - and then develop from there. You will be surprised how often such attempts work out. It also depends on your attitude towards the game, yet some people recommend making the game more complicated and less predictable when they see that they are behind - of course, in this case you start relying more on your opponent's mistake than on your strategy, yet it is also a sort of a strategy for hopeless situations.]
;B[eg];W[dh];B[ch];W[ci];B[eh];W[di];B[ei];W[hb]C[I didn't see this coming, but obviously needed to respond earlier to white 136 on F19.

Anton> Actually, these two stones could be safely sacrificed. The next too will be a little harder to let go, as we will see later...]
;B[ib];W[ha];B[ia];W[fp];B[fr];W[es];B[gs];W[ds];B[mh]C[Anton> It would be better to get deeper into white's "moyo", by playing around G8, for instance. Or even E8 - which can then connect to either the top or the bottom group.]
;W[jh];B[jj]C[Anton> Good.];W[ki];B[kj];W[li];B[mi]C[Anton> This is a valid move, yet for a later stage in the game. Still more imporant actions around (i.e. reducing the "moyo" on the left).]
;W[lj];B[ii];W[jf];B[je];W[kf];B[lf]C[Anton> The black stones are not threatened here, so I can't see a reason for this move.]
;W[if];B[hg];W[ke];B[kd];W[ie];B[jd]C[Anton> Sometimes in such cases (one stone to be taken, surrounded by a wall of the same colour) you can safely allow the opponent to capture - black H15, white K16, black K17, for instance, means that you stopped white from further invasion, by sacrificing one stone and one point of territory. This is a good price for the value.]
;W[he];B[ge];W[hd];B[gg]C[Anton> I can't see a danger that you were responding to here. If you do feel a danger to your group, though, always check whether by protecting it you are allowing the opponent to lock it in. In this case also it would be better to try to get more territory and eyes by reducing white's "moyo" (around F9, for instance), or connect with another group (H9), instead of making a very small move inside your own territory.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[hc];B[ig];W[jb]C[another vulerability that should have been protected earlier.

Anton> Agreed, these stones are getting important, and the groupd is getting weaker.]
;B[kb];W[ja];B[ka]C[Anton> This move is just one point in "gote" (looses initiative). There are bigger moves on the board.]
;W[ih];B[hh];W[fm];B[hj];W[fk];B[fj];W[ej];B[gj];W[hl];B[ik]
C[Anton> I can't see much meaning in this move.];W[il];B[kk]
;W[lk];B[kl]C[Anton> This move either...];W[lm];B[mg]C[Anton> These stones were safely connected, no need to waste a move on connecting them firmer.]

Anton> Yes, such mistakes happen to everyone.];W[ld];B[lc]C[Yet another mistake.  L17 would have been a little better, but I guess this group is all dead anyway now because white should not let me play black N19.

Anton> Yes, L17 only kills the group, while M17 allowed you to play N19 later.]
;W[kc];B[ma]C[nosoup4you has resigned the game.

Anton> Do not let this loss discourage you - this game has so much depth that for every player (except for the very best ones) there is someone to win against and someone to loose against. And a rule of thumb is that when you loose - you gain knowledge. When you win - you apply it. So without loosing you will never be winning :)

Best regards, and thank you again for the honor to allow me review your game,
