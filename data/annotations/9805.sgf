(;B[fb]C[I think this is move is a bit too small, and doesn't help you too much in making shape here because there are still weaknesses white could exploit later.

I probably would have made the wrong move here too but after looking at a few variations I think it is a mistake to protect the corner in this situation, since white can approach from either side, and you can only defend one of them.

On the other hand, right now white has two weak groups and you have a stronger group in the middle, so you can easilly put pressure on one of them while moving out to the centre.

Compare variation.];W[nc]MA[kc]C[Whites stones are overstretched here, considering that H17 is already quite weak. There is a big gap for black to separate the two stones at any point. See variation.]

(;B[qo]MA[pb]C[I would be concerned about the open corner here, which would give white more of a foundation at the top. It might be a good idea to attack whites stones now.

(;B[sh]C[This is the wrong way to extend.  I think white can cut you (see variations) and stones on the first line are rarely very useful anyway at this stage in the game.]

(;W[si];B[rg]CR[sh]C[This is an empty triangle - a very inefficient shape! The circle stone doesn't actually serve any purpose now.]
;W[qg];B[rf];W[of]TR[pl]LB[qi:a]C[At this point the white group on the right starts to look quite menancing.

I would be worried about a move near the triangle marker, which would block off your access to the centre and widen the white group.

At the same time, there is a natural cutting point for black at (a) which you could try if you want to play aggressively. The danger is that your black group at the top is also quite weak at the moment.]

(;B[pe]C[This is a very slow move and doesn't protect the top of your group. I think either of the variations would be better.]
;W[ne];B[oc]C[This move wouldn't have been neccessary if the last move was played in this area. Since it's a gote move, you are giving the oppoenent more time to strengthen their stones.]
;W[nd]C[Locally, this exchange looks fairly even, because black has gained territory and white has gained influence towards the center.

However, if you consider the whole board, blacks groups look very confined to the corners and have little room to expand, so this could be problematic for you.

The bottom left is very open though, so you need to play there ASAP]
;B[ob]C[I don't think this is neccessary. You should be able to handle any invasion in this corner without this stone, and it's not sente.

The bottom left of the board is bigger.];W[nb]
(;B[oa]C[This is definitely not needed. I can't see any weakness here.]

C[Consider extending along the bottom left instead. It's a big extension for white.]
;W[dg];B[eg]MA[ef]C[That cutting point is quite dangerous. May be better to extend instead, to strengthen your top group.]

;W[dc];B[ed];W[ad];B[af];W[bc];B[ah]LB[ee:a]C[This looks hopeless now if white plays correctly. If you can't read a way to save it you should consider defending at a, because there is a risk that everything could become separated and die.]

(;W[bj]C[This could be more severe, see variation.];B[cb];W[db]
;B[ch]C[You were *very* lucky this worked for you! In fact I think white can still kill you here due to the way the ladder plays out. See variations.]

[ne]SQ[fb][dd][ed][fd]TR[dh][df][dg][ef][eg][ci][di][bj][cj]
LB[ee:a]C[This is a risky move that makes your stone heavier and leaves a lot of weaknesses. You still have to put in a lot of effort to make this group live, and you now have more to lose if it does get captured.

After this move the triangle stones are still ok because they can escape by attacking the black groups on the outside, so it doesn't help much in attacking white.

Let's compare that with a defensive move at (a): Even if you allow that stone to be captured, it's just one stone. If the triangle and square stones get cut, you risk losing far more, especially since white is in a very strong position on the top already. You could potentially lose a huge chunk of the top left to white.

As a general rule, keeping your stones connected and your enemies disconnected is a very good idea, and you should be wary of having too many weak groups on the board at once, since it allows your opponent to push you around.]
;W[cm]C[Very big move for white, as it extends the bottom left corner.]
;B[ck];W[bk];B[cl];W[bl];B[aj]C[This move does nothing];W[ak]
C[This is also not neccessary. This exchange just fills in a liberty for white.]
;B[ai];W[dk];B[dl]
(;W[el]C[This is a bit strange. I would have expected white to just extend here. There is a crazy ladder if black tries to capture (variation), but there may be something else I've missed.]
;B[ek];W[dm];B[dk]
(;W[em]LB[ei:a]C[[variation\] White could probably allow that stone to be cut and instead play at a, but this is fine too. White is in a very strong position here.]
;B[ei]
(;W[he]LB[eh:a]C[White should cut here. If you connect you have a massive wall that will be very useful for attacking the top. If you are cut, you have two weak groups that must fight to stay alive. See variation.]

C[White's thickness from the earlier fights has built up a large moyo (framework) in the middle,  and white also has a lot of potential territory on the bottom.

You have the right idea to play in the middle in the board next, as it will would help you reduce either of these. Later you could use this to try and attack the right side or top more directly.

However, before you play here, you really need to strengthen the group on the left, as without it any stones in the middle will be stranded on their own.

A stone at (a) is sente now because white must connect to avoid capture, so I think this is the biggest move on the board.]
;B[jj];W[jh];B[ki]C[This is too small, and after whites answer the net result will be that white is stronger and you are weaker in this area. You need to be careful to avoid these kind of helping moves.]
;W[kh];B[ih];W[ig]C[Again, this exchange did not help you];B[ke]

;W[gj]C[:(]
(;B[kj];W[eh]C[Based on this game my advice is that you should think more about cutting and connecting weak groups. The smaller and more isolated a group is, the harder it is to defend, and the more opportunities you give your opponent.

Failing that, try to make eye shape, so groups can live on their own. Sometimes you extend weak stones with one space extensions, which is good for making solid connections but bad if you are surrounded and need to make eyes in a small area.

Be prepared to sacrifice stones if they aren't useful and there are bigger moves on the board.

Avoid playing on the first and second lines at the beginning of the game, and focus on building foundations in open areas near the corners and sides with.

Then try to make sure your groups have room to expand into, and prevent your opponent from doing the same.

Avoid playing forcing moves that don't strengthen your position after your opponent responds.]
