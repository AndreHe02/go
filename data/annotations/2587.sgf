C[plim:
Hello.
I played this game on KGS as black. I would appreciate pointers on big moves I missed, mistakes I made as well as answers to my questions.
Thank you!

bink:
My answers are marked by a "B:" at the beginning. There are two points which I find particularily important to improve your game: You play a lot of "forcing moves" as soon as they are possible. (I mean moves were your oponent has to answer directly). Look at the effect this exchange has on your own position and what effect oponents answer has on his position. Some of those moves are so called "thank-you moves": say help your oponent more then they help you. They erase weaknesses in oponents position which you might want to use differently later in the game. but you cannot anymore, as you fired away your "forcing move".

There is another theme in your game: The right way to attack. This is a difficult chapter. but very often the right way to attack is from a certain distance. Your attacking stones are then in a safe distance from the fight, and cannot easily be a target for attack themselves. Often the goal of the attack is not to kill enemies stones (exeption: whites reckless invasion on the upper side should have ended in killing the white group) but to get in those stones, which look from a distance at the attacked group. Ideally those stones give you influence on the rest of the board and you use them later in the game for a different purpose.  Blacks encircled group will not have much influence anymore in the game.

There is a book which could be good for you: Attack and Defense by Ishida and Davies published by Kiseido.

All comments which fit into the theme discussed above are marked by "BBB:"

Whites endgame was weaker then your endgame. I think that let you win the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[qk];B[cd];W[ec];B[gc];W[dd];B[ce]C[I think C17 was better because now W can play C17 and settle his group easily.

B: strictly speaking Black C17 might be better. If after that white cuts at C15 black cuts at D15 and a fight would start which looks good for black. You must be prepared for that fight, if you play C17. It is a fight were probably either the two black corner stones or whites stones around E17 die. I think white D16 is a mistake.
But:
your move C15 leads back to a typical Joseki position (normal development would have been white C17 instead of D16, black B17 white D16 black C15. this is exactly your position two moves later.)
Keep in mind: normally after your pincer you cannot expect to get white into serious trouble. if you get white into a living but cramped position on the side, and restrict his access to the center you can be satisfied.]
;W[cc];B[bc]C[B: this is now an equal position.];W[cb];B[bb]
C[B: Not good. you are forcing white out into the center, but your own stones are weak as well. You need to play D13, restricting whites access to the center (before attacking form a fist!). Probably white plays B18 after that, securing his base. But you can be satisfied (play e.g. K16 after that).]
;W[ef];B[de]C[BBB: Dont push into the knight move! You are helping white more then you help yourself.]
;W[ee];B[fd];W[ed];B[jc]C[B: your problem is: you need a stone aroud C12 as well.]
;W[fc]C[B: white should attack at C13 immediately!];B[hd]C[B: Far to small. Dont defend a single stone. you cannot really hope to attack white anymore, as he should play C13.
black c12 is big.];W[qf];B[qn]C[is it a bad move? Should I have respond the white approach instead?

B: as I said before the situation in the upper left corner is the most urgent one on the board. The difference if white or black plays around C13 is enormous. Otherwise R6 looks good to me.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[is it the good direction?
B: I must admit I am not really sure. The white move at R17 looks bad in my eyes. As well your move is good but also Black R16 is good. After black R16 you will later be able to destroy whites position on the right side by playing R11 or so. After your move white gets a flat position on the right side and you get a nice frame work on the upper side. R16 is more an attacking move. Your Q17 is quieter.]
;W[qd];B[nd]C[it seems little, slow and heavy for me but I wanted to keep the upper board but later W splitted my group and the game became tougher for me
B: Play Q15! you get more from the upper side while attacking whites right side. Thats the spirit!

B: Your two stones on Q are a little weak against whites two stones on R. Maybe because you felt that, you played so close to them. But the best way to strengthen them is to extend! After that whites two stones on R look weak.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[pe]C[I wanted to enlarge my moyo but maybe it was safer to just play M16.
B: It is a little late, but still Q15 looks good to me.];W[lc]
C[B: a white overplay. To deep with no support.];B[le]C[B: Good move.]
;W[nb];B[oa];W[kd];B[ke]C[BBB: Dont touch the oponent stones while attacking. you are strengthening them! Play K14 building a net around your enemy. If then K16 you can play J16. There was not much hope for the white stones, but now there is.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[md];B[ne]C[B: Play N15! Afraid of white O15 Atari? You can answer O14. white takes. black P15. white O16. Now O13 is good form. (your stones on the right side are not really weak. you can always play Q14 forcing an answer)]
;W[jd];B[ic];W[ie];B[id]C[BBB: again: you ar strengthening your oponent more then you strengthen yourself. after white K15 your two stones LM15 look even weaker.]
;W[je];B[gf];W[ig];B[gh];W[fg]C[B: now white is helping you. say "thank you" and play G13]
;B[gg];W[cg];B[bf];W[bg]C[B: getting your stones restricted to the corner is a big minus.]
;B[ad];W[ph];B[jq]C[B: Your stones on the upper rigth side need strengthening (e.g P12. Now touching is good: it strengthens your oponent, but also strengthens your very weak stones.) Otherwise K3 is a very big move. White should not hesitate to play L12 or so, attacking your stones severely.]
;W[gq];B[mp]C[B: better K5: building a large framework and restricting whites left side. to me it seems you are looking to much for small secure positions.]
;W[jp];B[kq];W[hp];B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[qg];B[kg];W[ii];B[fi]
C[it seems slow but I wanted to reduce white territory on the left side without being cut.

B: there is no white territory on the left side. its a moyo, far from being secure territory. but now your move should provoke white to start to take territory e.g with D10. Black C6 looks like a good invasion point (instead of F11). But more urgent is your group in the upper right. white M11 is a very strong attack.]
;W[eh]C[B: very restricted move. why not D10?];B[ei]C[B: good.]
;W[di];B[ek];W[dk];B[dj];W[cj];B[dh]C[I read that wrong:I thought I could capture W E12]
;W[ci];B[dg];W[df];B[fh]C[BBB: Again a "forcing move" you should omit. Here the additional problem is that your move doesnt really force an answer: it looks like sente, but it is not. A stronger player would not react and 1) attack your upper right group 2) take sente again and play E10 getting a big left side.
(if black E13 white plays C14 which is sente against your upper left group, and after that either takes sente again or plays F14. black will have gained nearly nothing apart from rescuing two stones, but that is really small)]
;W[eg];B[hj]C[BBB: white will answer J10 and that exchange A) helped the white group B) helped your group only little C) makes your upper right group even weaker.]
;W[jj]C[B: not quite as good as J10. doesnt keep the pressure on you.]
;B[dl];W[ck]C[B: white should take that stone.];B[fl];W[lj]
C[B: This attack looks a little soft. Better something like N12 or O13.]
;B[ld];W[kc];B[ki];W[kj];B[jh];W[ih];B[nh];W[nj];B[oi];W[pj]
;B[pi]C[BBB: leads to an exchange of stones which is bad for you.]
;W[qi];B[oj];W[ok]C[B: the last two moves took away two of your precious liberties. white now has the atari at O11 maybe followed by N12.  I know you want to cut at O9. But at least leave away the exchange Q11, R11.]
;B[nk];W[ni];B[oh];W[li];B[mi]C[BBB: What do you want to achieve with that move? white has a bamboo connection. to take one of those possible connection points (N11 or N10) will be answered by the other point. Leave these kind of moves away! In this particular case you will play N12 next move. why not play it directly? you will have the option to exchange N11 for N10 the whole game. Keep that option. By doing this exchange you are A) loosing a Ko threat. 
B) take away other options to play (well in that case there is not much) C) take away one of your liberties. Try to avoid these moves!  If you would have thought about playing N12 directly you might have seen that M12 is better then N12.]
;W[mj];B[mh];W[lh];B[lg];W[kh]C[B: white should leave those small things away and play P8.]
;B[jg];W[jf];B[hf];W[if];B[ji];W[ij];B[ol];W[pk];B[nm]C[B: good. keeps some pressure on the big white group.]
;W[hk];B[gj];W[ml];B[nl];W[qm];B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[hm];B[cq]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[ep];W[fq];B[bp];W[eo]C[B: white is giving away his lead here. white should play B5, black b3, white c6, black d2, white c8. the center is not worth much. the left side is worth more.]
;B[co];W[do];B[cn];W[em];B[el];W[dm];B[cl];W[cm];B[bm];W[bl]
;B[bn];W[bk];B[ej];W[ge];B[he];W[fe];B[gd]C[B: No! Dont defend that single stone. Thats just two points for white. take much more points (and eye shape) by playing F18 or G18.]
;W[gb];B[hb];W[fb];B[mb]C[B: not good! you are destroying potential territory for white, but:
- there is only a small amount of territory.
- you are giving white the move N17 for free, which allows him to push in with N15.
- you are giving white the move M18 for free, which allows him to play K18 without an extra defending move. 
- you are ending in Gote.

Better moves, bigger moves: black L18 (also takes away possible white territory, but doesnt have such a long list of disadvantages)
black C19 (is big and sente)
black Q13 (looks like double sente)
black J3
black L6];W[lb];B[na];W[mc];B[gm]C[B: ok you didnt end in gote with your N18. but now you accieved even less.]
;W[me];B[mf];W[kf];B[nf];W[lf];B[mg];W[pg];B[og]C[B: Here you see one side of the disadvatages of your move N18. you gave away a lot of points with N18.]
;W[gn];B[mm];W[ll]C[B: also white is defending single stones. white moves like L7, J3 are bigger.]
;B[db]C[B: black C19 is bigger as it is sente. By the way: white could now play C19. your move would go to waste.]
;W[dc];B[ca];W[eb];B[da];W[ba];B[aa];W[af];B[be];W[ag];B[ae]
;W[fm];B[dr];W[es];B[br]C[B: why not D1? black an white both give away loads of points in the endgame.]
;W[iq];B[kp];W[ko];B[jo]C[I think it is the move that made me win the game. However I was lucky since it was white mistake.
B: White could still play K6 and be not to bad off. see variations.]

;B[kr];W[rn];B[ro];W[rm];B[rp];W[ma]C[B: rather small. Bigger: J2, K18.]
;B[jb];W[ha]C[B: so small! white J2 would be big.];B[ia];W[ea]
;B[ba];W[ga];B[ir]C[B: yes! big!];W[hr];B[js];W[ka];B[ja];W[kb]
;B[pa];W[qa];B[gk];W[il]C[B: white should play J7. Bigger.]
