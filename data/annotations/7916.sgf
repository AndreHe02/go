C[Losah: Thank you for reviewing my game. I'm glad I found a place where someone stronger could help me improve. 2 friends and I started Go on our on, playing on the internet and against each other. But it is sad that we are the strongest players on our city. I wasn't too dedicated to the game lately, but now Ii've met some begginers urging to learn Go and I am trying to improve again.

I think I've played better games, but, since it is one of the latest ones, I've chose this. I've lost by time when thinking on a way to reduce the small difference bettew me and white, it was sad to see the time was over as the game was very exciting to me at that moment.
I was out of action for some time, and in that game I've got luck to keep a close score. Please show me how I could make it better ;)

Reviewer (R):
Hi,

I'm Sebastian. Your Game was pretty exciting. Very complicated situations I played out a lot of variations which I had to throw away over and over again. Hope I left you the most helpful.

Anyway. For Black I'd like to say that you have difficulties of judging whether or not a group is safe or not and when to make safety moves. You need to keep an eye on your groups. You are able to see the key points which is impressive but now you need to get the timing. Next Time you play try to keep an eye on all of your groups and try to evaluate how safe they are and how they could get attacked.

For white, you played very well. I only found one pretty bad reading mistake but the only one who can do something about that is you by solving many Go Problems. That is my advice for you. Improve your reading strength.

You both are great players I think and if you continue to improve you'll definitely start having very entertaining and thrilling games. Looking forward to that day. If you would like to have questions answered or further variations please pm me on KGS (Nick: Germoe)

At last I'd like to say that it is the first time for me to review for two persons, if I left somebody behind please tell me, I tried to comment on both of your moves equally. Although there is of course more to say for the one who is behind.
