C[Hello, I'm black in this game, at the end of i I thought I lose because of the ko I ignored, but it seems I was late anyway, could you help me understanding why ? Thanks :)

FM: hello, I am Martin and my comments will begin with FM: as my nick is Field Mouse]

(;B[nd];W[pi];B[qe];W[qg]LB[rf:A]C[FM: this move is too mild, usualy white goes to A for better potential to reduce the corner.]
;B[rf]LB[re:A]C[FM: this is questionable. Black might want to protect the corner with A later]
;W[rg]
(;B[gq]LB[jc:A][lc:B][mp:C]TR[nd]C[I'm not sure about this, but maybe K4 was bad already ? I thought it would give me a nice shape.


FM: the marked stone is played on the fourth line when you want to continue on the upper side with a move around A, as white B is a good move now. The G3 move looks good in case you want to continue at C and draw a good territory on the bottom. If you do not want to continue at C I think playing elsewhere (for example A) would be better. If you did not want to continue on the upper side, then the marked stone should be on the third line.]
;W[co];B[de]LB[jc:A][mp:B]C[FM: A is important now and B is also quite big]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ci]C[FM: black developed quickly, but black positions are not completed. Black should play this kind of opening if he wants to provoke some cool fighting.]
;W[jc]LB[lc:A]TR[cb][eb][dc][fd]C[FM: this extension is too small. The marked shape is considered super strong and is not good for making this kind of territories. Is usualy used as a force instedad. A, exploiting that black did not continue on the upper side, is a must here.]

(;B[cl]LB[lc:B][mp:A]TR[cb][eb][dc][jc][fd]C[FM: this move is not small, but A is much bigger. After the marked moves were played B feels much less urgent, though it is still a big point]
;W[mp]LB[qp:B][iq:A]C[I'm not sure I got the most of this invasion, what would you advise, where did I go wrong ?

FM: the reason why this is much bigger is that this not only erases a lot of territory, but also creates some bad aji at A and B, so black cannot attack too violently.]

(;B[mq]C[FM: This move is questionable. Attaching at opponents stones is often used in defence as it strenghtenst the opponent.]

;B[on];W[nn];B[op];W[np]
(;B[ol]LB[lc:A]TR[lo]C[FM: black tries to cut white, but because of the marked stone the feeling is that black is behind in this race. I think that A was better, the decision what to do with the white group can be done later]

;W[lm];B[kk];W[jm];B[ik];W[hm];B[go];W[gk]LB[gl:A]C[FM: this is a very optimistic way of playing. A is much better]

;B[fl];W[gj];B[fm];W[oq]
(;B[ii]C[FM: here I think is the reason why black lost - black was too afraid that the center group might die. This showed first with this move and also with some moves later, which costed black a lot of points.]
;W[gh]C[FM: suddenly, white connects comfortably with the cutting stones]
;B[ig];W[gf]LB[fi:A]C[FM: after this black must keep in mind that black needs to play the A peep as soon as white will answer it to remove some aji on the left side]
;B[cp]C[I tried something here, it seemed quite fair ... Did I miss a better way to attacj the corner gaining something ?


FM: this move is good, when black is around it destroys white territory in a good way]

(;B[me]LB[lc:A]C[FM: leaving the bottom unsettled is a big mistake. Also locally this move is small, A would be much bigger. If white tries to cut off the center group, it will live independently.]

(;B[kf]LB[je:2][kf:3][hg:1]TR[jf]C[FM: this is extremely defensive move. Black should play something more active. Capturing the marked stone with three moves is big pain]

(;W[sd];B[sc]C[I was late already, but thought if i win the ko i would do something with R12, it wasn't that great.

FM: the game still looks somewhat even and that is will be decided in the endgame if black played passively here]
;W[rc];B[se];W[ar];B[rf]C[FM: ignoring the lower left is too big. Maybye black should play the ko and ignore something smaller if possible as blck has quite a lot of threats starting at K18]

;W[ng];B[pg];W[pf];B[rj];W[ri]C[FM: the game is decided. Although black lost many points here and in the lower left corner, white won only by about 20 points, which means the game was quite fair before this happened.

I think that black made two important strategic mistakes in this game. The first if that in the beginning black built unfinished position on the bottom - black forced white to make a nice corner enclosure and then did not protect the side so white could destroy it. Also the O16 move was a tactical mistake - black plays it when he plans to add one more move on the upper side. If this is not planned then a move on the third line should be considered. Planning developement in the fuseki can make a difference.

The second mistake that costed black game was the center group, which black was afraid of losing and played many defensive moves to help it. Unfortunetely these moves also helped white and did not make much territory. In cases like this it is better to play more courageously (for example M17 instead of N15), or directly make territory near the stones to secure their eyes (for example P10).

I hope you enjoyed my comments & good luck in your games!
