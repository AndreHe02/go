C[Andre: Hi, this is a real-life game I played at a tournament. Due to time constraints I did not record it to the end. I have recently lost more than a fair share of my tournament games. Often, as in this game, I think I'm doing quite well, but somehow I do not manage to turn it into a victory. Unfortunately, the endgame is not recorded, but any hints would be appreciated!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[qn];B[ql];W[pq]
C[Andre: Kind of unusual, but in the end we came up with the normal joseki.]
;B[qp]C[reid: normal joseki when you consider the corner in isolation, but in this board position, black wants to play the other joseki - with black at Q3 and white connecting from R3 and R4.   Since black ends up in the wrong direction here, I think he has no choice but to challenge white with R3 - see variation]

(;W[qq];B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[nq]C[reid: Now black's K4 stone is not well placed, and his thickness from R8 and P4 is too far from Q16.]
;B[jd]LB[qf:A]C[reid: If I were black, I would be worried that my investment at P4 might be erased.  I think I'd want to play at a (R14).]
;W[np]LB[qf:A]C[reid: This seems too slow and too early.  A (R14) still looks bigger to me.]
;B[no]LB[qf:A]C[reid: A (R14) *still* looks bigger :-)];W[mo]
;B[mn]C[reid: Black is trying to build a wall here, but the area around R14 is still too open - the wall is likely to be made useless by a white invasion.  If that happens, black has traded a useless wall for the white territory in the lower right (S2) corner (which was black's originally).]
;W[nn];B[oo];W[lp];B[nm];W[ln];B[on]C[reid:  Looking at just the lower right corner, both sides have played the same number of moves (11).  But white has 15 solid points while black has only 10.  And the black stone at K4 is now uncomfortably close to a strong white formation.]
;W[cd]C[reid:  There is no doubt that C16 is very big, but isn't black's potential moyo bigger than white's?  White needs to play at R14!]
;B[ci]C[reid:  Smae question: isn't black's moyo bigger than white's?  R14!]
;W[ck];B[cf];W[hc];B[dr]LB[cq:A][hq:B]C[reid: It's a shame for black to give up the invasion aji at a (C3).  And now black must worry about white's invasion at b (H3).  Better to leave this for later (try to settle the F3 and K4 stones first).]
;W[hq]LB[cq:A]C[reid: This is too soon.  Black can take the corner at a (C3) first and then decide if he wants to save K4 later.  White should just protect the corner at a now, and let black worry about the H3 invasion.]
;B[hp]C[reid: Even if black succeeds in building a solid wall here, it will have little affect on white and no prospects for taking territory.  Black should just take the corner.]
;W[ip];B[iq]C[reid: Usually this is bad for black unless the ladder works for him.]
;W[io];B[hr];W[jq];B[ir]C[reid: The ladder black needs is when white now plays at a (L4).  Of course, in this position, white doesn't even need to play the ladder.]
;W[kq]LB[jr:A]C[reid:  Why not white a (K2)?];B[pf]LB[qf:A]
C[reid: By playing high, black invites white to invade deep.  I think a (R14) is harder for white to invade.]
;W[qh];B[rg];W[nh];B[mg];W[nk]LB[qk:A]C[reid: these are nice light moves by white, but I think white misses a chance here.  The contact move at a (R9) would be a nice probe.  Since the black R5 group is already alive, white can play contact moves against it to try to strengthen his weak stones.  White doesn't care if the R5 group gets even more alive :-)]
;B[lm]C[reid:  Is this really sente?  I don't think so.];W[kn]
C[reid: It is slow for white to respond here.  He is only protecting about 3 points of territory (black can't save his K4 stone even if white tenukis).  The white invasion force is where white should be focussing his attention.]
;B[ng]C[reid: The area above this black wall is too big to hold onto.  Even if black keeps sente and gets first move in this area, I can't see any way to protect it all.]
;W[li]LB[qk:A]C[reid: Again, I think white a (R9) to see how black responds would be an interesting idea.  White would rather live inside black's moyo than to run and let black build another moyo.

Looking at the whole board, it seems that black is falling behind. White has 20 in the lower right and 15 in the upper left. Black has ten in the R5 group, and about 8 in the F3 area.  He has the moyo in the upper right, but it is hard to count that as real.  If white gets to play R17 first, white might get almost as much in this area as black.]
;B[kg];W[jb]LB[qc:B][ji:A]C[reid: Hmm, I think saving the white invasion with a (K11) is bigger.  White has either K18 or b (R17), so he doesn't need to take either right away.

After white a, white can even start to think about taking some center territory.]
;B[ji]C[reid: Ouch.];W[jj]LB[kk:A]C[reid: Touching black here helps black get strong in this area.  I think jumping lightly to a (L9) is better.]
;B[ij];W[jk];B[lk]C[reid: Ouch again!  The vital shape point.]
;W[lj];B[oh];W[ni];B[pi];W[pj];B[qj];W[pk];B[qk]LB[cq:A]C[reid: This sequence is big for territory, but it's gote.  Probably a (C3) is bigger in terms of simple territory.]
;W[qc];B[qd]LB[kc:B][pc:A]C[reid: This looks like the wrong direction.  Since black already has S13 on the board, blocking at R16 only adds about 5 points to his right side.  If he plays at a (Q17) instead, he can aim at getting b (L17) later to get another 10-15 points.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[nc];B[od];W[pb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re]
;W[rc];B[cq];W[bg]C[reid: Does white need to do this?  I think simply blocking at C4 is enough to hold the lead comfortably.  With C4, I think white is about 10 points ahead on the board.]
;B[cg];W[bh];B[bi];W[ch];B[dh];W[bf];B[ce];W[be];B[di]C[reid: White gained a few points in the upper left, but black is now thick towards the 9 stone and towards the center.  Overall, this sequence is a loss for white.]
;W[ii];B[ef]C[reid:  I'd say that black needs to be a bit more practical.  Making walls is good in some places, but not all.  Specifically, the wall needs to be worth the territorial loss associated with making it.  If the value of the wall can be reduced later, the trade is not good.  In this game, black made some thickness, but the direction was wrong and he was unable to get the full value from the walls.]
)
(;AE[qp]C[reid: White is trying to pick a fight.  If black backs off and tries to return to an easy joseki, white gets the advantage.  My guess is that white knows black's direction is towards O3 and is trying a trick to pre-empt black.]
;B[qq]C[reid: Any other pkay allows white to get R3 which is too easy for white.]
;W[qp]CR[qp]C[reid: White will probably cross-cut and try for complications, but]
;B[qr]LB[qo:F][op:D][rp:A][oq:C][sq:B][pr:E]TR[pq]CR[qr]C[reid: this looks pretty simple for black.  Since black can play a (S4 atari) followed by b (T3) for life in the corner, white has no real good continuation.  If white tries to save the marked stone with c (P3), black has time to follow with d (P4).  If instead white tries E (Q2), black A, white saves with F (R5), black D, and white is split.]
