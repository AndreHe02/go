;B[pd]C[This review was requested by aviad 20k who played black in this  game vs. gambler 18k* on IGS on Sept. 28, 1997 (IGS local time).

gambler won this game by a 33 point margin plus a 0.5 pt. komi.

Review by droid 10k* from IGS.  This is my first review concerning either  player for the Go Teaching Ladder.

As usual, I submit these review comments with all the humility required  of a kyu player.  Players should take my comments with good humor and a  positive intent.  Hopefully either or both will improve their play, or  their growth as go players, as a result.

I will be using the masculine pronouns to refer to these players, as I  have no idea of their identity or gender.

I will preserve original comments in the sgf file with a dashed line  separating my text from the original, as below.

 aviad 20k : Israel]BL[843];W[ol]C[I would probably prefer white at o4 now.

White's play here invites black to attack the corner, while white's  potential on the side is somewhat limited.  Black stands to get positive  multi-purpose moves in the corner, which will strengthen black locally,  rob white of territory, and probably get black sente to play on the right  side again before white extends there.

White should place priority on his corner stone, since he is limiting the  potential uses (options) for his R8 stone by playing as he did in the  game at P8.  For example, white may approach the upper right corner at  R14, and at that time, the single stone at R8 would be useful for  virtually any black reply.

Simpler put is the proverb: "Corners first, then sides, then  middle"]
WL[829];B[rp]C[Black is conservative here, but I cannot say  this is bad.  Black gets almost sure life here now, and white almost  'must' respond before black o4, so Black also probably gets sente.]
BL[840];W[np]WL[826];B[qq]C[Probably premature move.    If black N6 now instead, then white needs to worry about black attacking  bottom or right side.  Since white cannot protect both at once, black  could get advantage in middle.]
BL[835];W[pq]WL[820];B[rl]C[Bad timing  I think.  It will only serve to strengthen white here, and will not make  black any more alive in corner than he already is.  Black S8 might also  give up sente, which white can use to extend up right side first.

Black better to play out at n6, or play elsewhere like Q10 now.  If black  leaves here now, he can look forward to attacking white later, perhaps  around m4?

Black is pretty secure in corner (try to kill him as exercize) - so  take sente and play big points  elsewhere.]
BL[829];W[rk]WL[783];B[rm]BL[813];W[pm]C[Hmmm.  I would  prefer R9 or R10 now.  This Q7 move seems to help black more than white.   Black might call this a 'thank you' move since he wants to connect at Q6  anyway.  Q7 does not strengthen white sufficiently I  think.]
WL[779];B[pn]C[Interesting sequence - but bad for white I think.

Keep in mind that black can look forward to playing s10 to reduce any  white territory on side.  White will have a hard time fighting this  without playing an extra move here, so white cannot get much territory on  this side yet.  (Imagine sequence: black s10, white t9, r9, r10, q9 -  now either black captures r8 stone, or captures r10 and s9 stones to  destroy white's wall there.)

In short, white needs two moves on right to make the right side into  worthwhile territory.  This is perhaps because of white's innefficient  formation due to play at Q7.

Therefore, the right side is not that important at this point for white,  and conversely, black is not as interested as playing here, since his  response to white is ready and waiting.]
BL[774];W[qj]C[Ok, white has reinforced his wall to prevent the moves I  referred to in the last comment.  This is bad for white, since he had to  'waste' a move here to do this.  Again, white has played somewhat  inefficiently here.  White would much rather have played this R10 as an  extension up the side at R14.

Black has sente, where should black play?  I would consider black playing  a big point on the left side of the board (d10?)

Black at Q9 is hard on white too - since the ladders formed there point  to black's k16 stone.  I might consider doing this right away, the more I  look at it, I think splitting white is unavoidable (and good for black).]
WL[760]
(;B[qg]C[This move invites white to run to center, and  strengthens black in corner - so I cannot call it bad, but this may make  it too easy on white.]
BL[765];W[ml]WL[738];B[mn]C[Black has endgame  play around p3 that might be leveraged here.  With an additional  unanswered stone at o5 and or n4, I think black can play p3 and capture  Q4 stones or gouge out white's bottom territory.  Therefore, a play at o5  or n4 might be a good forcing move to keep in mind for later fighting  here.

Black N6 may be useful in attacking the bottom, so I wont call it bad...

I think, for this move, that I would prefer being the first to play at  D10 now as black.  Possibly, by attacking from the other side around P10,  black may be able to for a giant potential territory at the top as  another alternative.

Black does not gain much from keeping white's groups separated here.   White has reasonable space on the right to find life there.  Black has  already gotten some just reward for attacking white there in achieving  sente to play a big point elsewhere.]
BL[760];W[rh]C[Bad by white.

This move seems to help black more than white to me.  White is not in  terrible life and death danger just yet.  I would prefer white at R17,  and then after the corner is settled, white plays above black around p13,  012 area and black gets compressed territory in upper  right.]
WL[736];B[rg]C[big - lucky for black]BL[755];W[qh]C[small for white, asking for black at Q13 - huge for  black.  Bad I think.]
WL[734];B[pg]BL[752];W[cf]C[finally the action shifts.  I believe  however, that black got a big advantage on the right side.  Black should  win this game.]
WL[719];B[df]C[Hmm.   Interesting choice.  I would  prefer to play a pincer attack, but this does have  possibilities.]
BL[745];W[cc]C[Wow.  Usually white would play at D13  first, to limit black's ability to extend there - which would be big in  this game.

Since I think black must follow white D13 with E14 in this game, that  would be better white play, IMHO.]
WL[716];B[dc]C[Right direction for black - good.]BL[712];W[cd]
WL[713]
(;B[ce]C[I think black better to just play at d15 here.  If  white does not play c15 in response to d15, then black push through there  will be severe.

In this case, black gives up sente here, which could be used to play at  c6 or to push white down to second line on left side.  See  variation]
BL[700];W[be]WL[710];B[de]BL[699];W[cg]WL[707];B[dg]BL[694]
;W[ch]WL[702];B[dh]BL[687];W[dj]C[White gets ahead, and up to  fourth line since black played c15.  Attack at c6 less attractive now  also.  This shows problems with black c15 move.]
WL[686];B[cb]C[Not big  enough yet.  Save for endgame.

If white plays at d18 first, it only makes black top stronger, so black  will get here first anyway.

Black should play now to extend/secure his top and attack white.  Black  at Q17 instead is huge.  Black at p10 looks severe.  Black at N10 looks  big.  Black at c6 or f3 look big.  Strategically, it is hard for me to  judge best move here, but p10 looks good to me.]
BL[685];W[bc]C[small  for now.]WL[671];B[pk]BL[676];W[pl]C[Interesting question below.  The answer  is to seek other questions!  Black does not necessarily want to save this  stone.   What black wants is:  to get a big strong wall facing the top and center,  and that may best happen by splitting white apart at R9.  But the R9 cut  can be used as simply the 'threat' behind the rest of the attack.  Save  the cut until it absolutely works.

Q9 can be sacrificed for the overall good of black's position - so don't  blindly try to save the stone - use it instead for its maximum power.

See variations for next move.
-----
How can black save Q9???]WL[642]
(;B[qk]C[premature I think - see variations.]BL[667];W[ri]WL[640]
;B[ok]C[P10 better here.  Black is creating his  own shortage of liberties for P9 stones.  This makes the fighting harder  for black.  P10 makes makes killing the two cutting stones harder - and  therefore white has difficult time saving his stones on right side from  death.]
BL[626];W[nk];B[nm]C[Premature - obviously so after next white  move.]
BL[620];W[oj]WL[593];B[pi]BL[609];W[ph]WL[546];B[oh]BL[569]
;W[oi]WL[532];B[nh]C[White has gotten absolute life on side, gained 8-10  points of territory there, and gotten sente.  Black did not fare well  here.

Look over variations around move 45 and notice that black's top is now a  few lines smaller - compressed by white who has more access to the  center.  This fight was a big swing for white.]
BL[525];W[ro]C[Gift by  white I think.  White would do better to shore up bottom with R2 then R4  and then save threat of s5 cut for late endgame.]
WL[488];B[qo]C[good  response]BL[511];W[qp]WL[485];B[rq]C[good response]
BL[509]
(;W[ni]C[terrible move - perhaps better at n11 or n12. See  variation.  Even better to leave this area and invade top or secure  bottom.

This move is like giving black a free play. White may just as well have  'passed'.]
WL[451];B[mh]BL[492];W[lj]C[Does not gain enough for white.   Play at k12 or invade top right corner now.  There is just no potential  for white in lower middle at this point - since black has his 'head'  poked out there at N6 and since a black c3 invasion will compress white's  potential in lower left also.

This move expands white's right side group by a few points - maybe two.   Is that worth it yet?  No.]
WL[427]
(;B[kn]C[This is not an effective attack on white's right side  (white is alive anyway) and white's center does not need to be reduced  - or at least it needs to be reduced much LESS THAN white's bottom needs  to be attacked, or black's top needs to be secured.

Therefore - I would prefer black at c6 or f3 still.  Black should also be  exploring variations of attack at m4.

If nothing else, black at Q17 now would make the entire top almost  unassailable, and the game would be essentially over.

See variation here for idea on where this game should go  strategically.]
BL[484];W[lo]C[Reasonably good for white (locally).   Probably more useful at M4, but this is more important than playing above  L6 around the middle.  So the local idea was 'right' for white.]
WL[375]
(;B[ln]C[Black could explore attacking at n4 now instead of  connecting to L6.  Black seems afraid to lose even a single stone, but it  is important to know how / when to sacrifice stones.

I've included a possible variation here - although it is likely not the  best course of play - the idea might be worth  exploring.]
BL[469];W[no]C[Not a big force - white has bigger plays  elsewhere still.]
WL[374];B[mm]C[Bad.  Black should probably ignore  white O5 and play around f3-4.]
BL[417];W[in]C[White is pushing black  towards an area where he will gain little, and white is surrounding big  moyo at bottom left - good for white.

Black needs to get into bottom left quadrant quickly - c3 invasion good  now i think.]
WL[351];B[jl]C[Bad - black is running away for no reason.

Black's stones are alive in bottom right.  White's are alive on right  side.  Middle is small area.  If white next plays at H8, white's bottom  left moyo gets even bigger...

So black should leave this place, and play directly in bottom left corner  I think.  I would look to f3, and try to secure life on the bottom with  maybe a cut around J5 to split white apart, or c3 as mentioned  before.]
BL[399];W[jm]WL[335];B[ll]C[Black is playing backwards!   Retreating from a winning battle!  There is no need to connect K8 to  bottom right yet, and attacking white's right group is useless.  No gain  here.  Yet white gained with K7.]
BL[308];W[lk]C[Small and unnecessary  for white.  C3-4 would be bigger now.]
WL[302];B[kl]C[Another small  play.  What has black gained?

Splitting groups apart is NOT effective unless there is a chance of  attacking at least one of them for kill.  In this case, black is  attacking a rock-solid group with plenty of eye space on the right side,  and also black is letting white strengthen the bottom, reducing black's  chances of fighting there.

Since splitting white apart is not useful, black's stone at K8 is only  worth maybe a few points as a prisoner.  Black should give it away, and  make a 20+ point (very rough guess) invasion at  bottom.]
BL[303];W[il]C[White's bottom right is starting to look almost  as big as black's top.  White is catching up.

See variation on move 63 again to get idea of the terrible steps  backwards that black has taken in the last 12 moves.  An attack at bottom  left like the one in the variation should be much harder for black now  that white is stronger around middle.]
WL[298];B[jj]C[More bad strategic direction.  Again this only attacks a  group that cannot be killed.  At least 'attack' it from the L11 side and  then maybe black can expand his upper territory.  As is, white can break  through around L11 easily and reduce black.

Back up and look at board.  This game is essentially a game of black's  top vs. white's bottom.  So do not invite white to reduce your top while  you ignore the bottom!]
BL[298];W[kh]C[Bingo.  Good for white.  But  white is lucky.  Black created this opportunity for white, and invited  white in!

Maybe black can now play at L11 and cut off L12  stone...]WL[295]
;B[li]BL[291];W[ji]WL[252];B[kj]BL[251];W[ki]WL[217];B[ij]BL[224]
;W[mi]WL[212];B[lh]C[Ok, at least black saw the  importance of cutting off white's L12.  Black is looking ok still at  top.]
BL[221];W[kf]WL[211];B[je]C[J11, M16, or Q17 probably better  ideas.]
BL[188];W[nd]WL[176];B[le]C[Bad.  Black should maybe M17  instead.

It is much easier to make eye space at the corners and sides than in the  middle.  White would happily sacrifice the four white stones in the  middle, if he could make a small living group on the side.  Black should  leverage all that looming strength of big walls in middle and on left,  and attack from the bottom to keep white floating and weak - black would  likely kill this way.]
BL[170];W[ke]C[Bad direction. For white - Q17  looks like big win now.]
WL[163];B[ne]C[Still attacking from wrong side.   Black is basically recreating the attacking potential of the wall black  already has at O12.  Why do this?  Surround white on the other side at  O17 at least, although I think M17 still  better.]
BL[151];W[ld]WL[147];B[od]C[Better perhaps to cut white apart  at L16 - white cannot capture M15.]

C[I think this is insufficient to cut white off, but will  reserve final judgement...]
BL[91];W[hi]WL[889]
(;B[hj]C[I would prefer J11 for black here.  Then black cuts at  L13 and captures L14 group.  See  variation]
BL[76];W[gi]WL[813];B[gl]C[Why go in this direction?

Consider this:  Black still has c3 invasion at any time, and cannot be  killed.  Since white then will have no territory in the bottom left  corner, white's only territory will be between d4 and G8 (assuming white  gets g8 instead of black).  Count the rough area for white in the middle  there, and it is very small relative to black at top.  15 - 20 points  max?]
BL[70];W[fj]WL[808];B[fk]BL[64];W[ek]WL[798];B[el]BL[54];W[dl]
WL[789];B[em]BL[47];W[dm]C[Black is currently assisting white to  get a large territory on the left side.  At the same time, black's moves  are gaining virtually no territory at all in the bottom-middle: Black is  putting stones there, but not surrounding any points there.  Although  black is reducing white's chances there, white chances there were small  to begin with, especially compared to the big gains white is being given  on the right side.

Also note that black has not yet split whites invaders at the top from  the white stones on the left side.  Black should do this ASAP to secure  his only major source of territory at the top.  Cut now at F11, or at J11  and L13!]
WL[786];B[hm]C[bad direction :)]BL[27];W[im]C[It white should  happily play at F11 now and happily ignore J7.   -----

WL[777];B[gn]BL[856];W[hp]C[Now white  is strong on the bottom as well as the left for something like 50+  points.  Black has gained 5 points in the bottom middle.  Black is about  to lose at least 40 points at the top.  So in the last 20 moves or so,  black has virtually given away 100 points!  It is a heartache to see  indeed. :)]
WL[755];B[fp]BL[851];W[ho]WL[720];B[hn]C[This move  saves black 1 point.  It should therefore be one of the LAST moves black  makes in the game.]

;W[lr]C[To answer question below - i think that black has maybe ko  threats at B16 worth 14 points.  White has ko threats at T16 and K19 that  are worth more.  The lesson to learn here is:  Ko fights rarely appear  'out of the blue' at the end of the game to save a bad situation.  One  must learn to manufacture a ko fight as an option to be used in a game.

At this late stage of the game, where there is a large differential in  points (white is ahead by 20 or so points on the board not counting  prisoners removed so far) black would need a ko that could swing a large  score, and that ko must be accompanied by ko threats worth the same  amount.  Well, at the late endgame like this, there just are not really  20 point threats left on the board.  So it is too late in the game to try  this.  Maybe black could use the ko to gain small points somewhere, but  he needs more than that now.

Black does not have enough KO threats for an invasion of the lower left corner, right?]

;W[qr]C[This exchange - black's lower right for white's lower left comes out in  white's favor I believe.  White captures 8 stones for 16 points of  territory plus 1 territory point and takes 12 points away from black for  a total swing of 29 points.
 Black on the other hand, gains 2 points with life in the lower left, and  takes 12 or so points from white.  Black has captured more stones than  white there - but only about 3 more, so black's gain in the lower left is  a total of about 17 points.

All in all, white gains about 12 points over this ko.  Not what black had  in mind I guess? :)

In retrospect however, black should not have let white capture the lower  right, and white conversely should not have let black live in the lower  left.  The ko should have been worth only the prisoners black generously  gave white in the lower right in trying this ko - about 5 points total  for white.]

;W[es]WL[527];B[sn]BL[400];W[tt]C[Ok game over.  In summary:

Both players played rather well in the opening I think.  I think black  came out of the opening with a big lead on the board.  But white not only  caught up, but took a large lead in the late middle game fighting.   White's lead became big enough to give back 30+ points in prisoners at  the top of the board, and still win the game.

This was mostly the fault of black's direction of fighting.  This was not  due to bad tactical fighting, but rather black's strategic approach was  very harmful to his very strong early position.  He tried to attack white  where white was strong.  He tried to grab territory in the middle where  there wasn't any to be had (he got 6 points there, and lost the entire  top side).  He also helped white to get very strong on the left side and  the bottom where white was originally weak.

Most of the mistakes made by the players in this game will go away with  playing experience.  I think that practicing tactical fighting will  benefit both as well.  A good book with tesuji or life and death problems  would be good to study.  I believe the play in this game was generally  well above the 20k level, and I expect to see these players increase in  rank rapidly with playing experience.
