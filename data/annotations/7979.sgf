C[Comment made by: Luke Yao Nien Chung

The variation at upper right is very interesting. White gain alot due to a mistake by black. however White's afraid to approach upper left corner allows black to surround enough territory to win this game. Main focus for white is the upper left corner, however white never played it. 

I will try to focus the review for white.]
(;B[dc];W[pp];B[cp];W[pc];B[pe];W[ph];B[md];W[ne]LB[oe:A]C[White attach at A is more popular joseki.]
(;B[nd]LB[od:A]C[Love2go: This was probably a bit unreasonable, according to EIDOGO.

But I did not answer in the way it sugested.

Luke: Normal response for black is to play A instead. Please see variation.]
(;W[od]LB[oe:A]SQ[pc]C[love2go: Is this a bad move? I think the result was not to bad for white, but maybe not good enough...

Luke: after black cut at A white's two marked stone have very weird shape.]
;B[oe];W[nf];B[qc];W[qb];B[pd];W[oc];B[rb]C[Luke: nice tesuji to settle for black]

;W[ld]LB[lc:1][nd:2]C[Luke: good response, now, black will lose one of the two group]
;B[me];W[kd];B[jc]
(;W[lg]C[Luke: This capture is very big and thick for white. However I would consider choose the variation below which is thicker]
;B[mf]C[Luke: Black continue misread this part];W[mg];B[ng]
;W[of];B[nh]
(;W[pg]C[this shape is awkward];B[lf]C[Luke: I don't understand black here.]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[le];B[jd]
(;W[mi]LB[jf:A]SQ[ng][nh]C[Is this to small? Maybe it is better to just nobi here?

Luke: When black play A black can potentially enlarge the upper left therefore i would choose to extend at A  or even tenuki in this area capturing two marked black stone is thick but white is already thick here with the capture of 5 black stone, there is no need to make this group that thick. Therefore this is a slow move]
;B[jf];W[nc];B[ig];W[qe]C[Luke: Good tesuji, this work because black force white to captured the 5 black stone in the middle]
;B[qf];W[pf];B[qd]
(;W[qg]C[wrong sequence];B[rf]LB[rg:A]C[Luke: compare to the variation, White lost a move here later on still have to block at A to seal black]

;B[gr];W[fo];B[gp]C[this variation white ends in sente I think it is alright for white]
;W[nq]LB[cf:C][qn:B][kq:E][lq:F][mq:D][nq:A]C[Luke: lower right corner white can play A or B but I can't really tell which one is bigger, i would prefer let black make that choice and I probably would choose to approach black's upper left corner with C

It is also possible for white play large knight's move at D to limit black's extension to E only. The O3 knights move allow a nice extension to F for black. In contrast, if white extend to D, then corner can be invaded more easily. Which one is better? I would have to say depends on the style of player.]
;B[qi]C[This is questionable for black, this area itself is not very big. Black should just approach the lower right corner or play at upper left corner]

also white's move in the corner should be B instead of capture]
