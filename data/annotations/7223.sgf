C[Where I want help:

1) The joseki and fuseki especially in the upper left.

2) My attempts to harass the group in the upper top (starting arond move 38).

3) My invasion in the lower right (move 70).

Of course, any other advice would also be appreciated.];B[qd]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[dq]C[You could also consider an approach move in the top right at this point.

Alternatively e4 or e3 might have allowed a white shimari in response to the one black is about to make!]
;B[oc]C[An approach move would have prevented this shimari]

(;W[qj]C[Maybe an approach around o3 is better - white may be able to complete a shimari in the lower left.

Alternatively the high CHinese pattern (d9) looks OK for white

The splitting move has an air of desperation about it at this stage]
;B[qh]C[Again black is probably premature here

The approach at c5 or d5 looks better to me];W[qm]C[OK];B[mq]
C[r5 looks better];W[co]C[Because c5 allows b k3 - reducing the value of the shimari

d9 is better];B[jq];W[jc]C[ok];B[cf];W[dj]C[The more severe squeeze at c12 looks better  - you don't really want black to be able to skip out to e14
and make a base on the left.];B[ef];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[ch]
C[wrong

should be b11];W[bc]C[I moved to the corner here because I wanted a safe corner group if black moved in around H17.

Better to rein force the top side eg k15

this move doesn't really make the corner any safer against h17

the main use of b17 is to prevent black making eyes on the left side however b is not really weak - so b17 looks like an endgame move.]
;B[qo]
(;W[eh]C[I don't like this move now --- I think closing off black's move to the side is more important.  C10 may be better.]

(;W[mc];B[oh];W[oj];B[go];W[gf]C[I'm trying to seal in black here, but I don't think it's the biggest move.  The center is becoming very large now, and I think O7 or P6 may be better.]
;B[id];W[ic]C[More usual to push up here  but this move may be right]
;B[ig]
(;W[ii]C[Capping, but from (I think) the wrong direction.  Since black will want to run to the right, I think a move like K16 or L15 is better.


If you want to kill the black stones then it is better to push more directly against the group on the right
However I don't think that this will work.

In that case you have the right direction to profit from the attack - but you should persist with it  - allow black to escape.]

(;W[qf]C[Two questions: Is this the biggest move on the board?  Does my alternative to 66 work better?

Not really sure it even works - see variations - however it is unlikely to be the largest move here because it relates only to a small area of the board.

m6 or g7 - expanding white's central areas look better]

You need to read out the consequences more carefully - there are some standard patterns for invasions like this.

Here you could invade at A or B - A is generally applicable - but may be less appropriate here because of the black stone at k3,

B works here because of the stone at R7];B[np];W[mp];B[oq];W[lq]

General comments

Be more consistent - adopt a strategy and stick to it.

Try to read out the consequences of your moves before you play them
(EG decide whether you are attacking to kill (and expect to lose if you fail) or just to gain territory!

Study standard invasion patterns there are some to be found in Fujisawa's "Reducing territorial Frameworks"

also in "attack and defense" (Elementary Go Series")])
