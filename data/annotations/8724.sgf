C[Hi Norman,
I am Paul Ohmart and I play on KGS as vorpal - 2d.

I'll preface my comments with v: 
Please feel free to contact me if you have questions about my comments.
Paul];B[pd]C[Hi, reviewer.

I was playing black. I won by a very small margin. (1.5 points).

I felt like I didn't really have a good grasp of what was going on for much of the middlegame. My opponent made a premature invasion, and I'm not sure whether I handled it right. I got a lot of influence, but I'm not sure how well I used it.

I'd especially like help on direction of play, choice of attacking moves, and correct use of influence in this game, but of course I welcome your comments in all areas.]
;W[dp]C[Norman314 [5k\]: hi gg];B[dd];W[qp];B[jd];W[jc]C[My impression is that this white move is terrible, invading my moyo so early. White is playing like it's a handicap game.

Norman314 [5k\]: How do I choose the direction of play here? L17 and J17 seem equally good, but the board is not completely symmetric, so it seems one should be better than the other.

v: Yea, this is a bit goofy but it does bring up an interesting point. When your opponent makes an off the wall move don't panic and just play straightforwardly.]
(;B[kc]C[v: I'm sure you can play on either side.];W[ic]
(;B[id];W[kb];B[lc];W[lb];B[mc];W[hc]
(;B[fc]C[Norman314 [5k\]: Not sure if this move is good. The idea is to make corner territory while attacking, but it allows white to make a turn, and the corner is still not completely safe from invasion. Maybe E17 would be better. Or maybe H16.

v: This is certainly a nice move from the point of view of the corner but I agree with your suggestion of playing at N16.]
;W[hd];B[pj]C[Norman314 [5k\]: I figured white might aim to invade R17 soon, so I wanted to have a good extension in place

v: This move certainly looks pretty big but I wonder about it.
On the top the corner is open and you have been pushed in from the K to N lines so playing like this emphasizes the center.

I might be inclined to play at P4 to contest the corner. Still, I doubt this is a game loosing move.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[qc];B[pe];W[ob]
(;B[le]C[v:  This move is very cramped. Separating is better as you suggest.]
;W[mb]
(;B[nc]TR[pj]C[v:  This i svery small. Almost like a pass.

I mentioned that the marked stone was not a game loosing move. This one, however, falls into that category.]
;W[oc]
(;B[od]C[Yuck, empty triangle]
(;W[nj]C[This seems like a key strategic moment. White is challenging me to make good use of my wall. I hope my response was good.

v:  I don't really like this approach for white. I think the game is a little better fo rhim but that he should keep to the corner-side-center priority.]
;B[ol];W[ok];B[pk];W[nl]
(;B[nm]C[v: This is very aggressive and I can't read out how things are going to end up from here.]
;W[om];B[pl];W[ml];B[nn];W[qn]C[It seems bad for white to let me connect my two chains without a fight. But he manages to build a nice corner territory as a result.]
;B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[po]
(;B[km];W[lm];B[ln];W[kl];B[jl]C[v: Again, I think you are playing all out.

This way of playing puts maximum pressure on the white group but I would be worried about misreading.
Also, I think the correct strategy is not to capture white but to make him pay for living by taking territory on the bottom.]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[jk];B[il];W[kj];B[in];W[oo];B[on];W[mp]C[Norman314 [5k\]: Aack! I've been busy attacking the center group and building up influence, but meanwhile white made a nice territory in the bottom right corner. I feel like I somehow should have been able to prevent that.

v: Yes, this is very nice for white.

v: Looking at the board overall it seems that the left side is the most open.]
(;B[kq]TR[mp]C[Norman314 [5k\]: This seems overconcentrated. What move would you recommend?

v: I would say that the marked white stone is very strong. This move then goes against the proverb which says play away from strength.]
;W[lq];B[kp]
(;W[fq];B[dj];W[cd];B[ce];W[cc];B[de];W[bb]C[v:  Really??]
(;B[cn];W[cj];B[ck]C[The plan is to chase white upwards and then make a splitting attack against the group in the corner.

v: Yes!];W[ci]
(;B[di]C[v:  But again you are pushing him down to the side where he wants to go to get life.]
;W[bk]
(;B[be]C[Norman314 [5k\]: Here's the splitting attack.];W[cl]
;B[dk];W[dl]C[v: The problem is that you might loose the lower left part of the board.]
;B[db];W[en];B[cq]C[Norman314 [5k\]: I didn't want to give white the whole corner, but maybe it's better to make an attack against the center group first. If I kill the center, I should be able to win even if white takes the corner. And if I don't kill the center, I can still end in sente and then invade the corner.

v:  I think it is do or die time in the corner. Your changces of killing the center group are slim.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[er];W[dq];B[dr];W[eq]C[Norman314 [5k\]: White E3 seems to be close to worthless. I guess it stops me from cutting off F3, but that's not very big. Am I missing something?

v:  Nope... worthless. This is whites equivalent of the move at O17.

You might not be able to kill white. You should concentrate on taking the outside while making him fill inside to make eyes.]
(;B[oj]C[Well, at this point I think that I need to attack the center group, because if it is allowed to live without any compensation for me, then I won't have enough points to win. But I really don't know the best way to attack it.

v:  I would say that you have entered the end game at this point. A good way to assess the position is to look at how the score estimator sees it. He gives you a 13 point lead.]
;W[ni]LB[lk:A]TR[oj][ok]C[v: Nice play by white. Your marked stone is mostly on a dame point.

I wouldn't bother to take white's marked stone. Your best chance to attack white is at A. The white delta stone contributes very little to eye shape for him. But a move at N9 in response to your capture does.]
;B[nk];W[mk];B[li]
(;W[lj];B[mm];W[ll];B[mi];W[nh]C[v: This move is gutsy! Maybe more gutsy than good.]
;B[lg];W[mj];B[hj];W[ki];B[mg];W[ij];B[ii];W[ik]
(;B[ji]C[This is the only way to keep white from living immediately. But it seems like I'm overextending.

v: Yes. You may have attacked a little early.
As you can see you won the game without killing the group so maybe you could have done even better.]
;W[hl];B[im];W[hk];B[fm]C[v: This sort of move smacks of desparation. As an endgame move I don't think it gets you much. I would be more inclined to play elsewhere.]
