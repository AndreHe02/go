C[This game was pretty close, I lost by 5.5 points.  I felt like I played a reasonable game, my biggest mistake was assuming that a group was alive when it wasn't.

I'd appreciate any general comments, especially about my opening, which I feel is one of my weaker points.
Thanks!

>>>Happy to help.  This is my first review on this system, so my reviewing skills are a little undeveloped.  Accordingly,  I would appreciate a short feedback message later on so I can learn how to review more effectively.  pcolclough@qch.on.ca 

Even with pros you find disagreement on many points.  This flexibility is a characteristic of the game.   I will tell you mistakes from my limited 3k perspective.  So take what seems true and disregard the rest.  :)

.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[jp]LB[jq:A][fq:B]C[Wanted to limit the influence of his shimari.

>>>  Agree.  Very big point.  Inhibits shimari and develops your star point--a fundamentaly good fuseki point.    

Having said that, here I'd prefer to play low at A because:  the low move leaves you better moyo invasion / reduction techniques if he subsequently makes a moyo based on a three point extension from his shimari.  Also if he invades the lower left side around B, he will be less flexible in settling himself because he can't threaten so easily to slide under A.]
;B[cf];W[cj]LB[fc:A]TR[di]C[>>>Here I would prefer a slightly tighter pincer.  Your move does work nicely with your lower star point, of course, and does limit the develoment of his approach move, but I feel it doesn't exert signficant pressure--in other words, he might immediately make a double kakari at A--which would help develop his upper right star point while he'd be developing on both sides of your star point.  The two space high pincer is my preference here. Either he'll jump out or into the corner, and as white I'd be pleased either way.]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[lq];W[nc]LB[jc:A][dg:B]C[>>>I think I would hold back to A here.  14 seems a little unbalanced.

-  White is high and open on the upper left.  Black, can make a checking extension.  White A stops this.  Plus A makes a good shape with the upper left, a nice framework.
- it begins to situate white in a better position to begin to squeeze the three black stones in the upper left,  beginning with something like B...  In other words, it looks like the black group in the upper left might become destablilized... if it does, having played beforehand at A helps the convert the entire upper side into cash when the running starts.
- If he forestalls this by immediately settling his upper  left stones, you will develop your moyo on the left side and feel good that the upper side is taken care of.
- finally, playing at A doesn't encourage black to strengthen the upper right corner or right side immediately.   It would be nice to get established on the right side before he makes this area much stronger.  Playing at 14 encourages him to start strengthening it now.]
;B[jc];W[hc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[kd]LB[dg:A]C[>>> Maybe play 'A' first.

I can't see black ignoring A--if he does you cut and then atari at E15 and he's split.  So he'll connect, but the presence of that white stone is helpful in hindering black's development. Your stone at 20 will be more effective for having A there already, especially when you split at G14 later on.]
;B[id];W[gf]TR[dg]C[Leaning on the stronger group to keep the J16 stones separated

>>> Agree... good move.  Imagine this move with white already at triangled point.]
;B[di];W[jf]C[Trying to seal him in, I thought I might be able to kill (probably a mistake to even think about killing), but decided to  at least seal him in.  Maybe it would've been better to play around L17 and force him to run into the center?

>>> You are right to try to seal him in rather than run him out--most times this is the case.  Your resulting thickness will come in handy when you get around to invading / reducing the right side.

   Plus... he just might not live.   :)  

Trying to kill is not a mistake.  It's just that it should be only one of the arrows in your quiver, used when the opponent just won't protect himself.

Killing is the bite behind the bark.  The key is to persuade him to give you little concessions when you bark.  Strong players will generally protect in time, so all you will get is the concession, not the kill... but that's enough.]

X is the generally the first point to consider in reducing moyo variants on the small knight corner enclosure--not the only point, but the most likely point, therefore the first to consider.

I would play here right now, rather than your next move, because that move helps black develop his moyo while attacking you.  Better to shave down moyo right now, before it gets out of hand.

(;W[qh]MA[oo]C[Better to try to settle the situation in the bottom left first?

>>>Bottom left doesn't worry me as white.... In corner W can capture two stones, plus lower side resolved in such a way as to leave weak black stones in the immediate area--so weak white stones on lower side are not at a fighting disadvantage. ... Main prob is black moyo looming in lower right.

I view White 56 as a mistake in that it helps black make the moyo even formidible.
 
You still  have nice reducing move at X
 Your thickness in centre will help.

;W[ph];B[oj];W[nh]C[>>> see how this tactic helps black build an imposing moyo?  The value of these three stones is much less than the value of black's last two moves and his next.]
;B[lo];W[hn];B[fn]LB[nk:A][oo:Y]MA[kb]C[>>>This is a major cross roads.

try to kill black?  try to chase him into black's moyo?  try to chase him and build up one's own centre moyo?  Try to destabilize black in upper left and then create a splitting attack?

At times like this.... count.  I would be taking time to count as carefully as possible and then choose direction in accordance with count.

I think If white get's the kill on upper side, at X, then with komi he has maybe 70 points max.

Don't think reduction at Y is possible anymore.  given  a more modest reduction of black moyo around A... which gives potential for white to take points in centre while ruducing black, ...vars to follow,... 
game is still close.  

Accordingly, I would lean on group in lower left in such a way as to set up a beachead for making reduction of moyo in lower right and taking points in centre as effective as possible.  One caution... white needs the kill on the upper side.  Therefore he has to do all of this in sente so as to get to X first.]

>>> Well it does put pressure on the four stones above, but, yeah I think it is a little Slack   :)
Maybe A instead?  This move helps your centre plus if he cuts at E10, you can ladder him at E11--also you have C9 to link under.]

I think you make a fundamental mistake here.  This is a move to make when you have to kill to win. It's a risk to take when your only alternative is take big risks. I don't think you do.

 There is a safer way to give yourself a nice advantage:  Cut at X, let him live small on the lower edge .... in GOTE.  Use sente to make modest sente reduction-of black moyo at right, then cut at Y

>>>This is a desperate ko because black can afford to let you live by saving his group on the upper side as ko threats:
If I were black now, I'd play H18 or L18, saving the upper side. You take the ko.  I take sente, solidy my moyo, and wind the game down.

SUMMARY:
==========

Your game overall is developing nicely I think.  Like all of us "on the way," you just need pointers.  Unfortunately, pointers generally expose one's mistakes, which leaves one feeling bad. You make many good moves, of course, but there is less learning potential for you in my mentioning them.  So don't dwell on mistakes I point out, just take what seems right to you and improve.

You are concerned about your fuseki.  It is hard to judge the overall strength of your fuseki based on 1 game.  Elements of your play... your move at L4 to limit his shimari and develop your hoshi suggest a basic sensitivity to fuseki; some other plays suggest blind spots.  Who doesn't have some?  To help you with this I will recommend Otake's book on Fuseki for further development.  You can order it on line.  It is superb.

Thinking back to my development, and assuming that everyone develops roughly along the same lines as me as they move up to around 3k,  I would suggest the following to improve:

1\] Make Counting a habit.  Count several times a game, beginning after about 50 moves.  It is very important to know where you stand in order to know how to play.  A hockey team never pulls the goalie to field another forward when it's ahead, but only when the clock's almost out and they're behind--that is when the risk is justified by the alternative.  The way you went after his group in the lower left, while risking your group on the lower side, was like pulling the goalie.  I don't think the risk was was warranted.  You had ways that were not risky to play, but didn't choose them, because, I surmise, you thought you couldn't win that way.  Counting gives you flexibility--to choose strategies and risk levels appropriate to the potential outcomes.  Without counting, one will tend too often to over or under play.

2) Improve reading / fighting ability.  Best way?  Go to the problem section on gobase.org.  Choose the Korean section.  Begin at the very beginning.  Do each of the four sections 3 ~ 5 times before moving on.  Ultimately this will have you doing thousands of problems.  I am on the last section and have done all of the other sections twice.  I find the results gratifying.  This process almost hurts at times if you do it properly.  You read a chain of sequences and your mind seems to get so far down that chain, then you lose it. So you start again, and lose it again, over and over.  Eventually you can see yourself reading deeper.  It hurts because your are really pushing through boundaries.  I think there is no quicker way to get stronger.

3) The difference between guys at my level and your level is partly reading, partly fuseki, partly shape, but a big part of it is balance.

One aspect of balance is to not go after the opponent in an unreasonable way.  Rather, be patient:  make good shape, develop in a balanced way that doesn't leave behind weaknesses, wait for mistakes. That is, let the OTHER guy try to take too much, extend too far, leave a group unproteced, take inordinate chances.  Because your groups will be balanced, you will be in a good position to punish him and exact a small price each time.  This you cannot effectively do if you are in a bad way yourself.  Two examples of this from your game, I think, are the group on the lower side, and the way you went after his adjacent group.  You had chances to end the fight in a way that had half his group living small in gote and the other half floating in a central white whale.  You chose to "risk it all" for the chance of catching him whole.  From my 3k vantage point, that was not balanced given your prospects of catching him, the weakness of your own group in the area, and the score.  You didn't need to  catch all of him; you didn't need to run that risk.

Well, hope this helps.

Good luck    :)
