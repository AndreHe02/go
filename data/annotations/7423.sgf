C[Dear reviewer,

I am 1d (KGS), playing white against an opponent of unknown rank.

I would like help mostly with the beginning of the game, since I seem to have helped my opponent build a very strong position. Second, I am curious about the invasion at move 77: I thought I should have been able to hold on to the top side, but my territory vanished in a few moves.

Thank you!

C[Az: W 'a' is also possible. Just depends what kind of game you want to play.]
;B[oc]
(;W[pd]TR[dc][pp]C[I think I shouldn't have started this without support around Q10, and that O17 would have been simpler.

Az: This is building influence towards the black stone, not towards your corner, so it's not very effective. You should definetly choose the normal joseki here since it works better with your position.]
;B[pc];W[qe];B[qc]C[Az: Good decision by black, now your stones are facing the wrong direction.]
;W[nd];B[mc]LB[qj:A]C[Az: The connection is very solid, but no matter how proper anyway says it is, it's also very slow. The extension to 'a' is big for both sides due to the position of B's stone in the LR corner, so I think this is more urgent.]
;W[pf];B[pj]C[Az: The result looks favorable for B. It is almost impossible to use your thickness now.]

(;W[nq];B[pn]
(;W[jp]C[Too high, I think, as we'll see in a few moves.

Az: Also just doesn't make sense with the B stone in the LL, a wide pincer would be natural since it would act as an extension...]

(;B[hq]C[Az: A good move, though B should stay a little closer to keep things simple.]

(;W[fq]LB[eq:B][fp:C][ep:A]C[I'm being too violent here. My stones are  thin, and K4 is too high. Should I instead play the forcing moves from A to C and then come back to somehow fix the stones on the bottom right?

Az: You should secure your own stones first, this is a pointless fight to dive into like this.]
;B[do];W[dn];B[eo];W[cp];B[eq]TR[hq]C[Az: Now the stone is well placed, the result is bad for W]
;W[iq]LB[kq:A]C[Az: Dubious exchange. You still have the weakness at 'a' left behind, and this removes aji for doing something to B later if you build up more strength. Skip this and go straight to c3.]
;B[hp];W[cq]C[Despite my earlier moves, I thought that this was a fair exchange, with White taking solid profit in the corner and defensible territory in the bottom right. The stone at J3, however, doesn't fix K4 as well as I thought it would.

Az: Correct, skip that exchange and come here.];B[lq];W[lp]
;B[kq];W[ir]LB[kp:A]C[Az: Too violent!! You don't have the thickness to fight like this, it'll just result in w stones getting cut off near B's thickness. 'a' is the only move for sure]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[mp];W[lo];B[mq];W[hr];B[en];W[dm];B[em];W[in]
LB[jo:A]C[This was a bit awkward later on -- should I have just played J5?

Az: I'd vote for the solid connection. It leaves you with good aji and it has almost as much effect on B]
;B[dl];W[ce]TR[em][en][eo][do][dq][eq][hp][hq]C[I was worried that if I cut, Black would be able to pressure my bottom group from the resulting fight. Looking back, I think I should have just cut, since Black's group becomes unstoppably thick after F9.

Az: I think you've correctly diagnosed the problem. Not cutting is unfathomable, especially since the main group is starting to look a little weak now]
;B[cl];W[bm];B[bl];W[cm];B[fk]C[Az: Now the game looks very bleak for white]
;W[ic]LB[kc:A][nb:B]C[Az: You may as well go all out and extend to 'a' in order to use the aji at 'b'. This would be slack even if you weren't down.]
;B[md];W[pl]LB[me:A]C[Az: This requires an answer before you tenuki. W looks desperate, but ignoring up top weakens the stones intolerably and makes things even worse.]
;B[mm];W[nl];B[nj];W[mk];B[mf]C[Az: B is attacking well, W is in a big mess.]
;W[ng];B[mj];W[kk];B[lj];W[nn]LB[mg:A]C[Az: B should have played 'a' immediately instead of answering you here. You were able to gain a lot because B bungled it here]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[ln];W[kn];B[lm];W[nm];B[jo]
(;W[jn]C[J5 instead lets Black cut off the O7 group (see variation). Also, if Black now tries to cut off the bottom with J5, White can still save the stones (see variation at next move).

Az: You have to play here]
(;B[kj];W[jk];B[qg];W[rf];B[mg];W[qh]C[At this point, I felt I was ahead: Black doesn't have much territory, and R3 is still open. But I didn't know how to deal with his invasion of the top side.

Az: Leading sounds a bit too optimistic to me, B has a lot of thickness facing the center so it will be hard for you to hold onto your moyo up top.]
;B[ec];W[ed];B[fc]
(;W[db];B[fd];W[ee];B[hd]C[J17 is doomed. Is there a way I could have better secured the top?

Az: It was a choice between the corner and k17. I think k17 was worth more, so you have to let him take the corner. You can't have everything so close to thickness.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[rp]C[Az: Unreasonable of B, he can't kill your corner since his shape isn't strong enough.]
;W[rq];B[rn]LB[ro:A][qp:B]C[Az: Ick, bad shape. He should play 'a' or 'b']
;W[gb]C[Az: This is very dangerous! Unless you are absolutely sure you can survive this way I would not recommend it]

;B[nb];W[nc];B[ma];W[me];B[la];W[le]TR[pn][pj]C[My last hope: to threaten to connect to J17, and in doing so threaten Black's centre group. Unfortunately, I also have to stop the triangled stones from connecting.

Az: It's a nice goal, but it's not realistic in this situation.]
;B[jd];W[qj];B[qk];W[pk];B[qi];W[rj];B[pi];W[ri];B[nr]C[Az: ... and your opponent passes a move. He should either kill the corner or tenuki. No more comments.]

C[White resigns: one of the marked groups must die.

Thanks again for the review!])

[mf][mg][kj][lj][mj][nj][bl][cl][dl][fk][em][en]C[Az: You are going to have to give up your corner if you want to save k17. This is the result of B's thickness and can't be avoided. It's also why I wouldn't feel so confident that you were winning earlier, since you have to take this into account when deciding how you view the top.]
