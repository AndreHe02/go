C[Kelly Braun (playing black)
 I did win by a bit but i know i messed up on a lot of my joseki  and
 my opening in particular is quite weak. Also it was a big time
 fighting game and i messed up quite a bit there as
 well

Zamoth : Hi, my name is Thomas.  I'm about 4k @ KGS.  I will review this game and try to bring you some pertinent comments about it.  As it is my first review, I hope it will be just fine.

Sorry for reviewing this game so lately, I became father on the 14th august !]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[kq]
(;W[op]LB[cn:B][op:A]C[Zam : Starting an invasion in a such a narrow place right at the begining of the game is not usual.  It's just telling the oppenent : I want a weak group.
Black is pleased]
(;B[oq];W[nq];B[np]C[This cut looked ok right now but it didnt work out for me

Zam : Looking for some fighting at a place where you start stronger is not a bad idea, although I don't know all the follow ups for this pattern.]
;W[mq]
(;B[mp]C[Zam : betternot go this way];W[pq];B[or];W[pr]
(;B[nr];W[mr];B[pp]C[Zam : Terrible ! white got the corner AND got out ! better just give the corner.  See variation.  This must never happend]
;W[oo];B[qq];W[qr];B[rr];W[os];B[fq];W[cj];B[cf]C[Is C14 better than G 17?
my thoughts were that if i played the other side  white would be too strong on top

Zam : When the game is still at opening stage, it is better to take the wider size.  You have time to reduce white later. 
Just like white did @ O3, you put your stone in a squeeze situation !]
;W[ce];B[ef];W[df];B[dg];W[de]
(;B[cg]LB[eg:1]C[Zam : I like 1 better : When you play C13, you don't have place to make eyes anyway, and you still have to run away.  E1 prepares for it !  The difference in points is not so important.]
;W[eg]TR[cm]C[Zam : Does white really needs this cut ?
I would rather like an extention.  Trying to kill is not the best]
;B[eh];W[fg];B[cl]C[Zam : I like this move, but black might be too thin @ D11]
;W[ej];B[dj];W[di];B[dk];W[ei];B[ci];W[ch];B[bi];W[bh];B[bj]
;W[dh]C[Zam : Not good locally.  You had 5 stoned place, and lost all of the.  You got 24 point on the left, white about the same I gess, but he has the center !]
;B[oc];W[pc];B[lc];W[od]TR[ic]C[Zam : Those stones are strong already, and white HAS to make an extention to take profite of his wall.  No time for that hane]
;B[nc];W[nd]TR[me]C[Zam : Why not pass instead ? Useless move.  If white wants to do this, better play @ N15]
;B[fc];W[ec]TR[hc]C[Zam : White is so strong here : PUSH toward strengh and seperate weak stones !]
;B[ic];W[mc];B[mb];W[md];B[qj]C[Zam : Good];W[qh];B[qm]C[Zam : I would have tried to seperate stones, but this exchange seems fair]
;W[oi]C[Zam : Small. does not put any pressure on black.  There are much more]

(;B[ph]C[Zam : Why run inside white's strengh ?

If you want to reduce, first hit the corner Q18, or even try to invade by sacrifing 2 stones (O18 P18)]
;W[pi];B[pg];W[qg];B[pf];W[qf];B[pe];W[qe]C[Is this move neccessary for white or can he start to close off black

Zam : Black 4 stones are so weak ! You just played 4 moves, made no territory, and made a very very weak group.  Those stones should have died]
;B[ng];W[mi];B[lg];W[mg];B[mf];W[mh];B[lf];W[ld];B[kc];W[kd]

(;B[nn]
(;W[nk]TR[kl][in]C[Zam : Should go into black's moyo, or if he wants to play defensive, he should reduce cutting points]
;B[in];W[jl];B[jm];W[km];B[im]CR[eb][pb]SQ[pk][po]C[Zam : Points are not in the center.  Are your stones alive ? Yes if W tenuki, see variation.  No fear for white. 

See importants points to play at (circles)
You have many sente moves to reduce black (squares)
You may even try an invasion @ C4 or somewhere]

could i have prevented that?

Do not hurry invasions at early stages of the game
When your group is living, play away from it.
Usually points are in the border, not in the center, so in middle/end game, if all groups are stabilized, look at the corners and the borders first.]
