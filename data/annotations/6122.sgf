Hi, I played white in this game. It was an even game and I lost by 7.5 points. I'm not sure of any major mistakes. Though it seemed the endgame would be what determined who won or lost. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

Hi!

I hope my comments can by of any help :)];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pf]C[White can play this way, but playing in the free corner would also be good.]
;B[nc]TR[cd]C[I don't like this formation too much - hard to develop the upper sinde after that.]
;W[pj];B[dp];W[fq];B[ip];W[cn]C[Any ideas for what  you think is a better variation here?

-------------------------------------------

I think White can play this way...];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[cq]
;B[eq];W[cp];B[go];W[mq]LB[mp:A]C[I would prefer the high move here (at A).]

;B[pk];W[qj];B[rp];W[rm]LB[rl:A]C[A move you should only play if you are sure you can kill the group. Losing the endgame at A is very big!]
;B[rl];W[rn];B[nl];W[mm];B[no]LB[nm:A]C[Better at A - Black is alive without any problems.]

;W[kd]LB[fc:B][ld:D][me:C][ng:A]C[This may be the turnig point of the game. Basically, the shimari in the upper left is the weaker formation, so i would like a probe or a reducing move there. Also, there is the danger of losing as much territory yourself around A as you destroy at the top.

So how about attaching at B or a move like that, looking how answers, exchanging then WC for BD and make sabaki at the top after that?!]
;B[md];W[ic];B[hc];W[jc];B[hd];W[kf];B[mf];W[ng]LB[lc:A]C[This seemed like the losing move since in the end it became useless.

I would prefer WA.];B[nk];W[mk];B[ok];W[oj]LB[lc:A][rf:C][mg:B]
[jq:D]C[This is way to solid. Basically, you are strong at the outside, so the danger of a black cut isn't that big. But even if you want to strenghen your position, you should do it with a somewhat more useful move, say A, B, C or D, all of them helping the stones that may be cut off by Black.]
;B[mg];W[kh]LB[lc:A]C[Better to make a base with A, I think.]
;B[mh];W[kq];B[fk]C[!? Strange place. White is solid, and there is no black territory in the middle.]
;W[ei]LB[ig:A]C[Also too solid, I think. Even if you want to prevent black territory in the upper left, you should do it with a move from your weak stones, for example A.]
;B[jk]LB[hk:A][jn:B]TR[fk]C[Bad again. Even if Black plays two more moves at A and B, there will be only 10-12 points of territory - not enogh for the invested four moves!]
;W[li]C[Again a dame point. Rescuing stones without any other aim is almost always bad!]
;B[cl]C[Well, that's looks like an overplay :)];W[dl];B[bo]
;W[co];B[cm];W[dm];B[bn];W[bk];B[dr];W[cr];B[bl];W[al]C[Perfect answers by white.]
;B[dn];W[do];B[en];W[eo];B[fm];W[ep];B[fr];W[dq];B[gq]C[White gains big around here!]
;W[bh]C[That is a true endgame point :)];B[dh];W[di]C[Too solid in my eyes.]
;B[bg];W[ag];B[af];W[ah];B[cf];W[fh]LB[lc:A][rf:C][ir:B]C[Black is still open at two sides - I would prefer A, B or C.]

;B[hg];W[ff];B[hi];W[ih];B[hh];W[lj];B[in];W[ij];B[hk]C[Ok, I think the lead doesn't change after this, so I'll stop my commentarx here.

To sum the game up, I think White played many many  moves without thinking about territory. Even when you attack, or defend, or do anything else, you should always thin: "How can I do this and make / destroy the most territory possible in the process?"

Good luck with your next games!];W[ik];B[il];W[kb];B[lb];W[la]
