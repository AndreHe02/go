AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,

it was one of my first games against a human player and i just
want to know what kind of mistakes i made and how I can improve
my go. I would be very happy if I could get some helpful advices.

By the time this game is reviewed I am reading the second book
of go by Richard Bozulich.

Raffael: Hi Bonscott. I hope to give you some good advice to improve your Go skills. As this was your first game against a human playe and could only place two stones, this was a very hard game.
Since I think you'll improve the most by just playinga lot and stick to some simple principles at your level, I'll try to not lose my self details to much and concentrate on the "big" thingswhich hopefully will let you play some ranks better if you master them ;)]
;W[dn];B[dd];W[df]C[Raffael: With this move, white is attacking your corner. As corners are the easiest to defend (then the sides and the "open field"/middle is the hardest), you should try to defend the corner.]
(;B[dh]LB[ck:A]C[Raffael: this move of you could be strong if you hade one or two more black stones on the left side (for example at A), supporting D12. but as it is  lonely and not strong on its own it doesn't threaten white and white may continue to attack your corner.]
;W[cc]C[Raffael: In the next few moces you try to defend your left side. This isn't bad. You could also have defended the top, which would have been a little bit easier because white has no stones there. but this is just an alternative and you didn't do bad.]
(;B[cd]C[Raffael: It's good to cut this lonely stone off.];W[dc]

;B[cj];W[ce];B[be];W[de];B[bd];W[ge]LB[bf:B][cf:A]TR[ac][bc]
[bd][cd][dd][ed][be]C[The marked stones aren't dead yet but they're in a tight spot. What's more, by playing at B, white can further reduce your precious space and set A atari in one move. Now would be the time to react and secure your stones]
(;B[qq]C[Going for the corner: as mentioned before a very good idea because they're eaesy to defend.]
;W[cg];B[bf];W[bg];B[jp];W[dg];B[en]LB[lc:H][pj:G][cm:A][go:F]
[no:C][gp:E][np:B][gq:D]C[This isn't a bad move since it defends you  against the white stone. But i think there are some moves which would be far bigger. Some examples:

A: Your stones on the left are very weak and white may threaten them with a pincer. This move would secure them somewhat and help you building a living group when white attacks

B/C/D/E/F: With those moves you would have threatened to take the bigest part of the terrytory on the bottom. C and F may be a bit to bold, considering that your player probably is much stronger. I think you would have gone best with one of the more conservative ones like D for exampl

G: This one is interessting. If white attacks from the bottom you may defend the upper right and gain a lot of territory there. If he attacks from the top, you would do the same but with the lower corner.

H: This could have helped you gain a lot of territory at the top, but G for example is a bigger move in my eyes.

All in all I personally would go with A or G, but the other ones aren't that bad too, i think.]

[aq][bq][cq][cr]C[Raffael: This is a though situation. By Playing towards the left white can attack  both marked areas.]
(;B[cn]LB[en:B][co:A]C[Raffael: This stone is somewhat weak because its on it's own and up against 3 connected white stones. Playing it at A and thereby connecting it would have made it much stronger and harder to attack.]

;W[bp];B[ao];W[bm];B[co];W[ds];B[cp]LB[fn:A]C[Raffael: this move doesn't threaten white. A Would have ben fare better because it defends you against the white group . ore make some big move elsewhere on a side to take more territory or in one of the right corners to secure them.]
;W[fn]C[Raffael: in the next few moves you do a very good job defending yourself]
;B[eo];W[ap];B[gp];W[jn];B[mo];W[jd];B[lc];W[qj];B[pl];W[qf]
(;B[rj];W[rd]C[Raffael: Some good defense moves following again...]
;B[qc];W[jc];B[kb];W[nc];B[ne];W[jb]C[Raffael: now I'd either try to flee to the center (maybe connect with the group at the bottom somehow?) or try to get a living group as quickli as possible]
;B[ja]C[Raffael: This move is a very good one because it starts a sequenze (till move 73)  in which black has to answer with his last move, giving you the opportunity to then act at another place (also called sente )]
;W[ia];B[ka];W[hb];B[ie]TR[hc]C[Raffael: Here you shouldn't try to rescue the marked stone. It's nearly impossible and the fare more important thing is to secure the group in the right upper corner.]
;W[je];B[jf]LB[nm:A]C[Raffael: Now there follow a lot of moves with which you try to escape with your groups or make some territory in the open. but this is a very, very hard thing to do. espcially against a player which is much stronger it's nearly impossible. not much else to say about this following moves. But for that i think you put up a hell of a fight!
You did very good for your level but lewy also made some HUGE mistakes (for example move 139) which is also the reason he gave up i think.

Just some random thoughts: Maybe by playing somewhere in the lower right you could have secured the territory there a bit more (a second stone in the lower right corner would do the defense good) or try to make some more territory  by trying to expand from the lower right corner in the direction of A


Apart from that there isn't a lot to comment in the rest of the game i think.]

Raffael: Well, now we're at the end of the game. I hope to have given you some good advice and all my remarkes are clear and understandable.
If you have any more questions feel free to send me an e-mail at any time :)

Wish you well and a lot of fun with Go,

(;B[qe]C[Raffael: This is the same thing again: Defending a corner is relatively easy and gives you a good bit of territory and in a lot of cases you should do it if you can (not always though!)]

(;B[cf]C[Raffael: I'd play here. With this move you beginn to build a wall around the corner while you still leave the possibility open to gain territory on the left side (from the look of the original move Black4 i think you were afraid of white taking the whole left side)]
;W[de]C[Raffael: if white plays here, you can easely defend your corner and strengthen your "defense wall" in the same move!]
