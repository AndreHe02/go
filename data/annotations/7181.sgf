Hi Fabian! Just a disclaimer: I'm just 5k, so my review might not be 100% accurate. Will try my best, though. Cheers!]

 a stone around C would be nice, perhaps at L3 (Chinese Fuseki)
 B would be kind of unneeded. Your stone at R4 already limits his expansion along the right side, and since both the R4 stone and his R14 stones are low, any play along the right side are relatively small. (see variation)
this original move, however, also has its merits. The cut at E10 can get very severe (see variation)]

This is not too far from the O4 group. O4 is definitely alive, so anywhere closer and your white stone would be the one under attack.

However, it probably should have been played at K4 so that after that, cutting the O4 group from the K10 stone would be easier]

The R16 group was quite strong from the start. The point of the chosen joseki is such that white gets a strong position at the top, while black also gets a strong corner in return. Thus, such groups should probably be left alone since it has a low position and has trouble expanding, while white will probably be unable to threaten it at all. a reduction somewhere around R12 will probably be the best move to fight against such a corner.]

So6 [11k\]: yes
So6 [11k\]:  see you again
So6 [11k\]: bye !

Overall, white's playing style is far too passive and defensive, while black is overly aggressive bordering on reckless. Thus, where black's crazy and impossible invasions should have failed miserably, white's lack of initiative and aggression allowed them to succeed. At the start, the moment white had the wall, if white had played the chinese fuseki (L3), the bottom is almost guaranteed to be white's. At that point, the game would be heavily in white's favour.

As white, your primary weakness is the passivity (that said, don't learn from black and invade blindly). Another weakness is your sense of direction. Generally try to play at the sides where both your positions are high (4th line stones), followed by sides where anyone is high, then lastly low positions (3rd line, in this case the right side. As you probably noticed, after the joseki, your wall was facing the low black position. you ended up with a very small territory there because black could attack without risk to his low corner, while all you could do was retreat.)

To answer your initial question, walls should either be made into huge territory, or used to harass weak invading stones, allowing other areas to benefit from the harassment (with one side facing a huge white wall, black's options will be limited to running since he can't counter attack as your white wall will kill him easily. A common way to gain is when black invades close to your wall, in this case around F3, pincer him at H3. He will most likely do a 1 space jump up to F5. you can then follow suit and keep jumping. In the end, he will have a long chain that is difficult to kill but still not yet alive, while you will have another wall at H. Another white stone at P3 and the bottom right QUARTER, not just corner, will be yours). Thus, try to avoid josekis that give your opponent a solid base near your wall. Either choose a joseki that gives you another wall facing the 1st, or pincer him to make territory with your wall, or choose a joseki that gives him a floating group which you can attack.

I guess that's about it, cheers!
