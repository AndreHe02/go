C[gnik (IGS 6k*) reviewing for enrico (IGS 11k*) playing white
againt johnv (IGS 12k*).  2 Aug 1998.];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp]
;B[cn];W[jp]C[my last move is a mistake ?

gnik: It's more common to see F3, F4 or C8.  With K4 black can
get a double-approach (i.e. black F3 or F4 next) which you've
got to be ready for.];B[dj];W[jc]C[why usually on 3 line and not on 4 this kind of move ?

gnik: The advantage of the third line over the fourth is
that you can usually make a base to live more easily, whereas
with the fourth line it's easy to undercut, and so remove eye
space.  Here if black plays on one side e.g. M17 white
can play a two space extension on the other side at G17.
A two space extension like this is an ideal shape for
life, and is hard to kill.];B[hc];W[nc]C[gnik: You could also have played at N17.  With O17 you need
to be prepared for black to play in the middle at M17 at
some point.];B[qj]C[now how to use tenuki on corner ?

gnik: Black's move here let's white off the hook at the top.
I think a smaller extension from Q16 at Q14, for example
would be more aggressive.
For white next in the top right, think through what would
happen if you play the usual moves on the corner at Q17,  Q18, R17, R14, and Q14.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[oc]C[at this point my problem is life easy at top and attacking black
stone on right, how can i do that?

gnik: Don't worry about attacking the R10 stone yet, first
play threats against the corner to stabilise the white groups.
It would be a great result here if white managed to link up
and also enclose black in the corner.];W[nb]C[my move here is a mistake, maybe better enclosing corner ?

gnik: O16 instead looks far better, enclosing black and
helping to connect the two white groups.];B[nd];W[md];B[ne]
;W[pi]C[this move is bad but i'm freight playng different move what can
i do here ? i feel bad situation on w group at top i have 2 group weak
and i'm attacking i'm not satisfacted here if black answer calme w is in
trouble

gnik: The move that caused this was O18, if you had played O16 things
would have been easier for white.  At this point though white is fairly
safe at the top, and should be able to easily escape on the side.  The
problem is that black has lots of threats and is too safe.  White does
have R17, which looks interesting for later.];B[qh]C[gnik: This looks like an overplay, black Q10 or R11 look better.
I think black should be trying to get thickness by enclosing white
first before a move like R12.];W[qi];B[ri];W[ph];B[rh];W[pj]
;B[qk];W[pk];B[ql];W[me];B[rf]C[gnik: This result is good for white.  Next white can play at
O14 to have a great looking position.  It happened because
of the black R12, S11 moves which let white get forcing
moves in, gaining thickness.];W[pm]C[gnik: P7 would have the same effect, but doesn't leave a
cut (see variation).]
(;B[he];W[cf]C[another questionable move where is the good way ? building mohio
?

gnik: Another possibility is to take the corner with C17, and
then think how to reduce further.  B16 is also a move to consider.]
;B[cd];W[ef];B[fe]C[gnik: Black D13 first looks better to me.]
;W[dh];B[ci]C[gnik: Good move for black.];W[nf]C[gnik: At last!  This looks like a good move to me, and I might
have played it instead of Q7.  But at this moment I would be
very worried about the three white stones on the left.  Black
now has an easy target.];B[pe]C[gnik: This black move seems very timid!]
;W[jj]C[gnik: This looks good, but the three stones on the left
look very vulnerable.];B[lg];W[mf]C[maybe here is another error maybe better protect mohio attacking
black stone ?

gnik: No this looks like the proper move.];B[jg];W[lj]C[gnik: This looks slow to me, although it's very solid.  I would
be thinking of how to attack the two black stones, or how
to defend the three white stones on the left.];B[ol];W[pl];B[kk]
C[iil];B[ki];W[kl]C[gnik: You should just connect here, now you've weakened
your position.];B[ll];W[lm];B[mj]C[this black move help me i think.]
;W[ml];B[lk];W[nm];B[mk];W[en];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[pr]
;W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[cp];B[dl];W[fh]C[this move is bad or good ?

A point how can i exploit that if is important ?

gnik: Black looks too hard to kill now, so I wouldn't
think about J14 just yet, save it for later.  Those white stones
on the left look very weak, something should really have been done
about them sooner.];B[gi];W[be];B[bh];W[bg];B[bd];W[gf]C[this move is bad, if i can live in another way,

gnik: C12 gives you miai for two eyes.  If  black responds with B11
you play A14 and if  black plays A14 you play B11.];B[ff];W[fg]
;B[gg];W[gh];B[hg];W[ch];B[bi];W[ej];B[ek];W[fj];B[gj]C[here where is good direction for me ? i played no points move   here ?

gnik: F9 next is the obvious move to me, H12 also looks good.]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[gl];B[fm];W[fn];B[gm];W[gn];B[hm];W[hn];B[hl]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[di];B[ck];W[hh];B[ig];W[hb];B[ic]C[gnik: J18 or G18 are more usual.]
;W[ib];B[jd];W[gc];B[fb];W[fc];B[ec];W[gb];B[eb];W[kd];B[kc]
;W[jb]C[gnik: That whole sequence starting from H18 was a huge
mistake for black.];B[je];W[ld];B[ee];W[df];B[ob];W[dm];B[cm]
;W[ad];B[ac];W[ae];B[bb];W[bo];B[ce];W[hj];B[hi];W[ij];B[el]
C[gnik: Unnecessary.];W[jh];B[ii];W[ih];B[ji];W[kh];B[lh];W[ag]
C[gnik: Unnecessary.];B[kg];W[ah];B[ai];W[al];B[am];W[bm];B[bl]
;W[an];B[bn];W[am];B[ak];W[ao]C[gnik: The sgf file I had gave a different move, but I think it
was corrupted, and I'm guessing that you played here.];B[jr]
C[at this pointg black can live ?   there is a better answer for w in
this situation ?

gnik: I don't think that black should be able to live, but it happens
so often at kyu level, that it's worth putting another stone in to
make sure.  White is sufficiently ahead that playing an extra stone
to protect the area would have been a wise move.];W[kr]C[it is possible to live for black now ?

gnik: Attaching moves are not the best moves for defence, because
they give you a weakness.];B[jq];W[kq];B[hs]C[where is the move here ?

gnik: H1 looks odd to me.  I think black should die now.  H3 for white
looks like the shape move.];W[gq];B[gp];W[fq];B[fp];W[gr]C[gnik: H3 looks better to me.]
;B[fs];W[hp];B[ip];W[hr]C[gnik: Not another empty triangle!  You are leaving to many weaknesses.
H5 instead looks better.];B[ho];W[es]C[gnik: J3 looks better.]
;B[in];W[do];B[ik];W[jo];B[jl]C[now teaching ladder can stop i start to play unthinking moves
:)

gnik: White has J5.  Only you can stop making unthinking moves :-)]
;W[ir]C[now comment are not important, this is the end of game.

gnik: The end-game is very important, often games are
won or lost in the end-game.];B[km];W[mm];B[io];W[iq];B[lo]
;W[kp];B[om];W[nn];B[nk];W[on];B[qm];W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[pb]

C[gnik: Oops.

I think white should have won the game.  Black got a good
result when playing in the centre where white was strong,
which was a big turn around.  Also black was able to
reduce white at the bottom, more that he should have been
able to.  If you kept your distance when attacking you
would have a stronger attack.  The book  "Attack and Defense"
by James Davies is very good at explaining such things.
Also, try to learn to love the end game!  It can make a huge
difference if you're far better than your opponent at the
end game.  It's also very useful to try to count the score
in the end-game.  You can then base you move decisions on
your score.])
