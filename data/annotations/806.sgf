;B[pd]C[Hi.  I'm 'edgy' and I played White in this game.

I can see there were a lot of tactical mistakes in this game;
I've added some marks and some variations where I noticed them.
I'm sure there are many  more.  But, I know there must have been
equally bad strategic errors, and those I can't seem to tell at
all--so your comments about them will be even more helpful.

Thanks for your help!];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc];B[qk];W[nc];B[kc];W[qc]
C[I think you're choosing a wrong joseki here. With this move, Black can build a wall towards the left side while you take territory in the upper-right corner. If later Black plays a standard joseki against your stone at c17, he will also take influence while you make territory in the upper-left corner. This threatens to give Black a really strong top. I think that the jump to o15 was a better option.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe]C[Black is departing from the joseki here, which would have black r15 at q15. The problem is that it's hard to know how to take advantage of a non-joseki move. I messed around with possible replies and couldn't see a convincing refutation. White will have to take advantage of the weak point at q15 later.]
;W[re];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[rf]C[White doesn't need s14 to be alive in the corner and with this move he is crawling along the second line, which should be avoided in general. This gives Black the opportunity to push at r13 and extend his wall. On the other hand, Black s14 would be sente and the result would be even worse for White. Black is definitely getting too much in this sequence and that's because Black r15 hasn't been properly punished. Yet, I don't know what White should do to prevent this.]
;B[qg];W[dj]LB[hc:a][ke:b][je:c]C[I considered playing around 'a' (H17), but decided that would
just help Black build his moyo after he jumps to 'b' or 'c' (L15, K15).

White a Black b or c White h15 don't look so bad to me. Preventing Black b seems difficult at any rate. White r11 would be a possible point to enter Black's sphere of influence later.
But Black b or c are not necessarily the best way for Black to use his influence. He could consider a shoulder hit at g16 for example.
Note also that a is a good point for Black.

Because of his low stone at c17, I think White must do something to prevent Black from getting a too good top. Maybe d15, c14 or f17 could be considered.

Of course, d10 is also a reasonable move.];B[fq];W[iq];B[fo]
;W[dn];B[lq];W[ho];B[dr];W[gr];B[cq];W[cp];B[bq];W[eq];B[er]
C[Black f2 keeps his stones connected and White's stones separated.]
;W[fr];B[bp]C[I think Black e4 followed by f7 is more important because it keeps White's groups separated.]
;W[fp]C[Good. White is connected and has thickness while Black gets a small corner.]
;B[bn];W[bm]C[Too insecure to insure territory on the left side. I think it is better to tenuki.]
;B[co]C[Not useful and helps White reinforce his weak b7 stone. I think Black should tenuki and take advantage of White's weakness later.]
;W[cn]LB[do:a]C[Would 'a' (D5) have been better? I was surprised that Black
never cut after this, since the ladders don't seem to work.

White's move looks ok. Black's cut at c7 doesn't seem to lead anywhere because of the white stone at d10 (see var).
White a would do little to help the b7 stone. White c7 is another possibility. Black e5 or d5 are not really dangerous.]

(;B[dd]
(;W[dc]C[I thought this was the right direction  (see variation), but
now I think it was wrong (see the variation next move)

Both possibilities seem to have their virtues and drawbacks (see comments in vars).
What you played leads to tougher fights and leads faster into the middle game, while the other direction looks more like a large scale exchange.
I think I prefer the direction you chose in the game because White is thick further down (so this is where White wants to drive Black) and Black is threatening to make a large moyo at the top.]

(;B[cd]C[This is not joseki, is it?  (See variation)

I don't think this is joseki and I think Black should have played e16. Because of the White stone at d10 and of his own stones further to the right, Black should not be going for this side of the corner.]
;W[ed];B[ee];W[fd];B[dh];W[dg]C[At first sight, I thought this was more agressive than White could afford, but it seems to work after all. Maybe Black had to play a tighter extension at d13 (a further indication of the wrongness of c16).]
;B[cg];W[df];B[de];W[ch];B[ci];W[bh];B[cf];W[ff]C[Looks like a nice move, trying to take outward influence and leaving the territory White could take with d11.]
;B[ef];W[eg];B[eh]C[Black is playing a move that helps White more than himself. He should play b11.]
;W[fg];B[di]C[Should still be at b11. The two white stones at b12 and c12 are not neutralised by this move.]
;W[bd];B[bg];W[fe];B[ce];W[ag]LB[cj:a]C[Bad move, I think.  Was 'a' better?

I agree that a13 is not very useful. White a Black b10 is not very interesting for White. If he wants to take the territory on the left side he must play White b10 Black b11 White a, but this is gote. I think it's better to tenuki (take j17).]
;B[bi];W[ic];B[je];W[ie]C[Not useful.];B[jf];W[ne];B[ng];W[mp]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[ej]C[It is wrong to tenuki here. A proverb says "hane at the head of two stones" : Black should play o4. r5 is also a big point.]
;W[dk]C[The same holds for White. White should ignore Black's tenuki and play o3 or r5.]
;B[ek];W[el];B[cl];W[dl]C[c7 bigger.];B[cm]C[Good.];W[bl]C[Wrong.]

(;B[hj]C[I think this was wrong, and that Black could have just played
C9 (variation).

I agree that c9 is very important now. However I do not completely agree with the vars you suggest (see comments in vars).]
;W[ck]LB[dm:a]C[Would 'a' (D7)  have been better than this?

c9 is probably better because it captures firmly and leaves little aji. For instance Black has fewer ko threats after White c9 than after White d7. b9 might be good too.]
;B[fl]C[Still better to play in lower right corner (o4 or r5).]
;W[fk]C[Idem for White...];B[fj];W[gl]C[Not consistent with White's previous move.]
;B[gk];W[fm];B[hl];W[gm];B[po]C[A crucial move.];W[op]C[p4 is not very good as it invites Black to connect all his stones. The hane at o3 is no longer useful after Black r5. Since there is little White can do now about Black's big corner, I think White must first hane at l3 and later the important points are r11 and r7.]
;B[oq];W[pp];B[qp];W[nq];B[nr];W[np];B[pr]C[r2 is safer (as White demonstrates later).]
;W[kq];B[if];W[he];B[rg];W[qo];B[pn];W[qq];B[rp];W[qr]
(;B[qs]C[What about Black s2 (see var)?];W[rs];B[lr];W[rq];B[ro]

(;W[sr]C[I misread this.  Instead the capture at Q1 seems to kill Black (variation).

I agree that q1 seems to kill Black.];B[kr];W[jr];B[ps];W[ks]
;B[ms];W[im]C[The cutting point at l4 is too dangerous to be ignored. White l5 or l6 look ok.]
;B[kp];W[jq];B[mm]C[Nice move : claims a huge territory and threatens White's o4 group at the same time. Uses the cut more cleverly than if Black l5.]
;W[om]C[Unreasonable. White has no other choice than to neutralize the black cutting stone at l4 in order to regain maneuverability.]
;B[on]C[Makes the infamous empty triangle shape. Black o6 does the job.]
;W[qn];B[qm];W[nn]
(;B[pm]C[This looks too timid to me.  I think Black can just cut (variation).

I agree. By the way, Black's cut would have been sente because White had to defend his o4 group, so that Black would have had a free move to make a big center (at k8 or l8 for example) and take a huge lead.
Black suffers a huge loss here because of wrong reading.];W[nm]
;B[nl];W[ol];B[ml];W[ko]C[I wanted to push at P9, but I was afraid of getting split in
two if Black played L5.

Ignoring l5 seems to lead to a complicated fight. Considering that Black p9 seems to give him a big advantage, White could choose to play p9 and hope to come out ahead from the fight to follow. But White l5 is also a reasonable move.]
;B[ln]LB[ok:a]C[Wasn't 'a' (P9) much bigger?

I agree, Black p9 seems to be the only move. It seems that Black lost his concentration in the last few moves and as a consequence lost much of his large advantage.]
;W[ok];B[pj];W[nj];B[mj]C[This contact play seems to be wrong. Black has to accept that White's invasion has succeeded and calmly pull out his endangered stones with m10. Here White can simultaneously threaten to surround Black's five stones and to pull out his o15 and o17 stones. Neither has many chances to work, but White will gain something in the process anyway.]

C[Should be k6.];B[be];W[bc];B[sf];W[mn]C[Bad move. Makes no points, gives Black threats. And Black t14 was a big move.]
;B[lm];W[lk];B[mk]C[Thanks to White, Black now has slightly better opportunities at k6 and k7.]
;W[bj]LB[sd:a]C[Was it better to defend at 'a' (T16)?

Black s16 is big but it's gote. I think that White can afford b10.]
;B[ah];W[an]C[This seems to me to be the losing move.  A real 'thank-you move".

This is a bad move because it is small and gote (since you have to defend at d5). Giving away sente costs a lot. But what cost you even more is that you did not defend at d5.]
;B[bo]LB[do:a]C[I missed that Black is now threatening to push at 'a' (D5).
It would have been better to have played 'a' myself, or to have
played T16, instead of my last move.
