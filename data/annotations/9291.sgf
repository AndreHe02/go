Nilsen89:
Hello, I will review your game the best I can,
I'm around 1-3kyu international ranking as well as KGS.

I will start my comments with "Nilsen89:"];W[dd]C[neomancer [10k\]: i lost this game really really badly so i feel like there is a lot i can learn. overall i feel like i lost a lot of territory by being too greedy and trying too hard to kill, yet some groups seemed like they were very weak...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nilsen89:
Let's see what you could have done better,
please keep in mind that often handicap games tends to be decided on reading skills.
Which is often hard to teach.];B[df]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nilsen89:
It is hard to say that this move is wrong, however the basic principle behind your "B" move is to limit
white's posibility to create a huge framework on the top.  Also the result locally tends to be better for white.

In this opening, you got the bigger influence, and your opponent is a better fighter,  I would suggest playing at "A" instead.
See variations for examples.]
(;W[fc]LB[fd:A]C[----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nilsen89:
"A" move is more common, however this move is more secure. White is trying to stay strong.]

(;B[hc]C[----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nilsen89:
This could be sucide.
Since this is a handicap game, we do not want to give white a chance to attack our stones, if white jumps out now, we got 2 weak stones.
Just finish the joseki.];W[bd];B[dk]LB[kc:B][bd:A]C[can i just ignore b16 the way i did?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nilsen89:
It is hard to find a good local move, however it is important to remember that since the "A" stone is low,
the left side is becomming less imporant since white can alway jump under your stones.

I think I would maybe play at "B".];W[qf];B[nc];W[qn];B[ql]

This is overplay, here we have to play "A" or "B" to protect the corner,
if you do not like the joseki variation comming out of this sequence, I suggest playing a longer pincer then "C".
Maybe a higher pincer, something like "D".];W[np]

(;W[mr];B[or];W[lp];B[gp]LB[gq:A][iq:B]C[----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nilsen89:
I would suggest playing on third line. "A"

We say: 
Play third line when making a base.
Play fourth line when making influence
Play fourth line when invading to jump out.

If white plays at "B" now, we feel that we would owe a local move.
If we aready played at "A", we would not owe that move.

See var.]
(;W[of];B[oh];W[mf];B[kd]LB[mh:A]C[----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hard to know if this is correct.
We say that we play urgent moves before big moves.
I would say that the marked group is becomming relatively weak, and maybe play "A" would  be better.]
;W[rd];B[fe]LB[qc:A]C[----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nilsen89:
This move seems slow.
Letting white get a living group, base and corner by giving up the San-San at "A" seems to important.

"A" looks interesting. However you should maybe play to protect your right group]

Again slow. You are not gaing much here. And white is getting stronger to attack your right group.]

Here I think it is important to stop, and take a good look at the game position.

What does the marked group do?
Nothing.

How much points does white get by taking them?
8points.

Is 8 points the biggest move on the board?
Not even close.

Should black then defend?
No. It's still slow and small.

How much points does each player have?
Lets start with black.
Maybe 20p with alot of influence.]

From here on out you are playing scary moves, trying to protect stones that isn't important.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nilsen89:
I agree.

I think we can start to look at the game as a whole again.
We remember that a few moves back we tried to protect two black stones. (Marked)
Because of this we now have 3 weak groups. A/B/C

This is a good example on how as I mentioned it being an all-inn strategy.
If we played more simple a few moves ago, we would most likly had 15 points at the left side. however white would have taken the two stones.

Also by reading, we can see that white can not kill the black stones. So you might play risky and play something like D/E/F instead.]

Nilsen89:

Now the game settled alittle again.
Lets take a good look at the game.

A - Group is safe.
B - Group is very weak.
C - Two stones is big aji, but shoud not be saved right away.

Black have around 30points.
White also have around 30 points.

However we still see that black have more influence.
If we play safe we will win.];B[jk]LB[ch:B][dh:A]C[----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nilsen89:

This is really really scary.
The fundamentals tells us that saving stones is gote.
And white have some really good attacking moves.
-------> I think this might be the losing move.

Playing around A/B seems like a must.

Nilsen89:

 I hope the review was somewhat decent.

Usually I study the opening a lot, and this being a handicap game with few joseki's makes it somewhat hard.

You need to focus on what's important, and that is getting points.
Take some time in the game to do a fast count, look at influence, and make a winning strategy.

We see more then once that you try to save stones that either are small, or can't be saved.
Which in the made you lose the game.

When playing a game think of this:

1. Play urgent moves. (Moves that makes your group strong) Example mistakes: Move 12, 28, 30, 44, 90, 106
2. Play urgent moves. (Moves that makes your opponent weak) Example mistakes: Move 30
3. Play big moves. (Corner first)
4. Play big moves. (Sides)
5. Play big moves. (Center)

Do not attack with weak groups. Atleast not when you are playing a stronger player. Downfall started at Move 78 ->

Try to look for places where you can make points. 
So you do not save unimportant stones that makes white reduce your potential for points. Example mistakes: Move 80, 126, 142]

Since white is ahead on points and little influence, we should focus on getting points ourselfs..
Instead of limiting whites points.

We could then say, that white is not going to get many more points, maybe 10 more if he extends from bottom.
We could say that black is going to get alot more points. So it's important to start getting points.]
