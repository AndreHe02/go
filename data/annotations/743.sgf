General comments : the fuseki was very quiet and peacefull - it can not be bad.

I can not see mistakes in the fuseki. I have pointed other ways of playing.]

Well, let's have a look.

The fuseki was very peacefull, both having strong and stable groups. Black have a lead in territory, that is normal : he played first.
