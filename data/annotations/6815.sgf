C[Kashomon [5k\]: hi, gg

Reviewer: Long
Long: Greetings. Go is an art of exchange, and go players are like businessmen -- fight for the best deal (by conversation and argument, openly) and find another big one after that. These correspond to the fields of which I'd like to draw your attention to.

I try to list as many as variations as I can think of (no warranty for proper functioning), which I hope can give you an inspiration for improvement.

Let's begin.];B[qd]C[nick2006 [5k\]: Hello, Good luck and have fun.]
;W[de];B[pp];W[dq];B[oc]C[Should This move have been played at D17?

Long: Can be, but not necessarily. Anyway, it is just the beginning of the game, and different people will have different preferrences. P17 is no "wrong" spot. Just keep on your track!]
;W[jc]LB[qj:A]C[Long: White Can also consider R10. That is what I would usually prefer. However, White seems to be tempting to play this move when he plays D15.]

(;B[dc]C[Long: B chose an immediate invasion. If B does not wish to play here, he may also...]

(;W[gc]C[Long: Seems a 'loose' move here to me. Just as an alternatives, W can also...]

(;B[ce]C[Long: I have a little doubt about this move. See variations...]
;W[cf];B[cd];W[df]
(;B[ed]C[Long: I'd leave this step or...];W[ge]C[Long: B's corner is not big, and is sealed inside.]

(;B[ck]LB[cl:A]C[I think this got me into trouble.  I think it might have been better to just play R10 or Q 10

Long: Nope, this move is OK. But I'm thinking of A instead. Possibly better?]
;W[cn];B[ch];W[ci]
(;B[dh];W[di];B[ei];W[dj]C[Long: Now B seems to be in trouble. But W's shape is not good either.]
;B[fg];W[ff];B[bh];W[eg]C[Long: Not necessary.];B[eh]

(;B[fh]C[Long: B missed the chance.];W[np];B[ej]C[This was really bad.

Long: Yup. Helping W to correct his mistake.];W[dk]LB[pn:A]
C[Long: Why not just give up those 4 useless stones and play "A"?]

(;B[kq];W[qm]C[Long: I seldom see these moves. Interesting.]
