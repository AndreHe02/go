;B[pd]C[Comments by Didier, dkropp@magic.fr. In this game, Black showed a good fighting spirit. Black has to remember the go proverb 'Always hane at the head of two stones'.]
;W[dp];B[pp]C[Black plays a ni-ren-sei. The hoshi stones are considered rather poor at defending territory, but are considered good for attack and influence. In this kind of opening, Black often builds moyo, waiting for White to invade them, and then attacks White.]
;W[dc];B[de]LB[ce:a][dh:b][di:c][pj:d]TR[dp]C[Good place for a kakari. If Black plays a low kakari at "a", W will pincer him at "b" or "c" : these moves are both a pincer and an extension from the marked stone. A high kakari as in the game limits White possibilities. If Black does not want to make a kakari, Black can as well play "d", building a san-rei-sen.]
;W[ce];B[cf]LB[dd:a]TR[pp]C[An other option is to play "a", starting the nadare joseki (avalanche, grant slanting), as the Black marked stone at the bottom right corner (hoshi) acts as a ladder breaker. But this fighting joseki has a lot of difficult variations...]
;W[cd]LB[fq:a][df:b]C[Variation 1 : current game ("a").



Variation 2 :

Black plays at "b".]
(;B[fq]LB[df:a]C[I can not say that it is bad to tenuki after White 8, but Black must be prepared to the cut at "a".]
;W[cm];B[cq]LB[dq:a]C[Dubious move, it is too early in the game for invading the 3-3. White can seal Black very easily by playing "a".]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[df]LB[dg:a][ep:b][cg:c][bp:d]C['Always hane at the head of two stones', go proverb. Black must consider the bottom left corner. E4 ("b") IS A VITAL POINT IN HIS SHAPE AND BLACK SHOULD PLAY AT THIS POINT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. A Black play at "b" is almost sente, threatening "d", securing the corner, and starting to build a nice influence facing the bottom side.



Variation 1 : current game("a").



Variation 2 :

Black plays at "b".



Variation 3 :

Black plays at "c".]
(;B[dg]LB[cg:a]C[Bad move. This move helps White to gain thickness. Much better for Black to play at "a", see variations.]
;W[ef];B[eg]TR[de][dg][cf]LB[pj:a][ep:b][di:c]C[Heavy move. It seems better to leave the situation as it and play elsewhere ("a", "b",...), as the marked Black stones have a lot of aji. Or maybe Black can play a light sabaki move like "c".]
;W[fe];B[ff]TR[de]C[Bad move. It helps White to gain thickness, destroy the aji of the marked Black stone at D15, and does not help Black so much.]
;W[ee]TR[de]C[Bad for black. White has reinforced himself, gained a big corner territory, the marked Black stone at D15 has no more potential, Black has a heavy shape with cutting points.]
;B[ck];W[dk];B[dj];W[ek]LB[ej:a][cl:b]C[Variation 1 :

current game ("a").



Variation 2 :

Black plays at "b".]
(;B[ej]LB[cl:a][ep:b]C[Better play at "a", to create cutting points in White position and to strengthen the Black group (see variation). And do not forget the Black move at "b"...]
;W[cl];B[cj]C[Black is over-concentrated.];W[qf];B[nc]LB[nd:a]
C[Good move, better than "a".];W[nq]LB[lq:a][ep:b]C[Variation 1 : current game ("a").



Variation 2 : Black plays at "b".]
(;B[lq]LB[pj:a][ep:b]C[This agressive pincer is very often played when Black has already a stone around "a". If White then invades the 3-3 point, Black builds (gote) a strong wall facing this stone and starts building a nice moyo.

But again, a Black move at "b" seems better (see variation).]

Variation 2 :

(;B[ql]LB[op:a][oq:b]C[Bad move. Good fighting spririt, good direction, but Black has a big  weakness at "a" ('Always hane at the head of two stones'). First Black should play at "b" (see variation), sente against the White group (if White does not answer the group is dead).]
;W[op]C['Always hane at the head of two stones', go proverb... B will be left with too many cutting points.]

;W[rp];B[qo]LB[no:a]C[Bad move. White can connect anyway. Black has now a dango (clump of heavy eyeless stones). It's better to play "a" .]
