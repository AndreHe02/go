AB[dd][dj][dp][jd][jj][jp][pd][pj][pp]C[P: Hi Timo! My name is Peter. I play on KGS as petition and am 2-3k. It's challenging to review high handicap games, especially for black, because of the large advantage b has. As well, in this game, b won by resignation, so again, it is challenging to find useful comments to give you in a game that you won. Lost games are much more useful to review, so in the future, I would suggest submitting even or low handi games that you lost, as those are the most instructive. However, there is still quite a bit to talk about in this game, so let's get going!

T:We tried for a first time recording game live for later review. White is 4-5kyuu friend.]
FG[259:]PM[2]
(;W[qg]C[P: In order to win a high handi game, w must capture black stones on a large scale. W plays a strategy more suited to a lower handi game, of establishing secure chunks of territory. W needs to encourage chaotic fighting and outread b, but instead w encourages a peaceful game. B doesn't make any big mistakes, playing very solidly (if a bit too solidly), and is ahead by more than fifty points when w resigns.

In order to give an interesting review to B, I'm going to review mostly moves by W and offer some alternatives that would have given B a harder time, thereby showing weaknesses in B's strategy. 

To start, it's hard for w to win a high handi game from the third line. See variation for a different beginning.]
;B[qe]
(;W[og]C[P: White plays this jump a couple of times, and it is not at all a good move in this situation, being much to slow. In a high handi game, the usual joseki ideas must be thrown away, and w must be prepared to be totally unreasonable. See variation for a different idea.]
;B[ne]C[T:Friend suggested O17 as it would provide better protection for cover. Me being greedy wanted to enlarge the corner instead hoping it's solid enough already.

P: Your friend is right. O17 is a much more solid move, because it protects the corner from an invasion at q17, which this move doesn't.]

(;W[qj]C[P: This is again the wrong idea, clinging to the third line. Attachment plays strengthn your opponent, and this sequence makes black very thick, contributing to the huge territory b creates in the lower right. I would prefer q8 as w. See variation.]
;B[qk];W[pk];B[pl]C[T:I decided to basically sacrifice the stone at Q10.

P: This is a good way to play as B. Simplify and avoid fights. However, you let the q10 stone go a bit too easily. This let w become stable without having to work for it and carve out about ten points of territory. A basic principle of playing as black in a handi game is to never let w make solid territory, keep them off balance.]
;W[ok];B[ql]C[P: Well done. Nice solid play. Your stones on line 8 are just the right distance from q4.]
;W[rj]
(;B[ol]C[T: Aparantely P10 would have given at least fighting chance to save the stone(and reducing white area there)?

P: Yes, pushing up at p10 would have been better. See variation.]
;W[oj]C[P: W is very over concentrated, w's stones cast little influence and didn't make much territory.]

(;B[mq]C[P: This is quite a passive move from black. This move does nothing to defend the corner and nothing to pressure w. Consider the two variations for other ways to play here.]
;W[qp]C[P: This is the wrong move by w. W plays this way when the area on the right side is more important than the corner territory. However, in this case, w has no potential on the right, due to the strong b wall. I can only imagine that w was being greedy and wanted to prevent any b territory. Correct play locally is to take the corner at r3. But the best overall move might for w be to approach on the left side around c14.]

(;B[qo]C[T: Decided to give up the corner to build area toward center instead.

P: In this case Timo, that is the wrong idea. The area around r6 is not worth very much, and this sequence makes it worth even less. it is still open at s9. The corner is much larger. Better to solidly take the corner, profiting from w's mistake in not taking it for his/her self, then attacking the weak w group that would result. See variation for b punishing w.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[ro];B[qn];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]C[P: W can be pretty happy locally, having gotten way more than s/he deserves. Globally however, a confined group in the corner does nothing to make the game easier for w. It would have been better to play on the left side instead of rushing with r4. These points are larger, and would leave the corner invasion open for later, rather than taking ten points now and giving b such thickness. (Of course, b could have had a similar result without giving w anything, as per the previous variations)]
;B[nk]C[P: This is an important point, but it's slow to play this way. A move around d6 would have made a much more formidable moyo.]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[T: Missed O10 which friend suggested later.

P: Yes, O10 is your privilege any time.];W[fe]C[P: One of w's big problems in this game is playing the usual josekis. In a high handi game, the usual josekis lead only to assured defeat for w, since they are designed to give even results. W needs hugely uneven results to catch up in a game like this. The one point jump is almost laughably small here, it's like asking to run away with a weak group.]
;B[cf]C[P: This is the right direction but the wrong point. Play on the fourth line with d14. It puts more pressure on w, possibly forcing another one point jump, and then you could play d12 and control a large area on the left side. C14 though does not require a response.

I can imagine that you might be cautious about playing on the fourth line like that, considering your choice of n3 as well. Maybe consider studying some high enclosure josekis, or about how to invade such enclosures. I know I found moves like d14 hard to handle when I was a double digit kyu, because I wanted them to be taking territory and was frustrated by how often I would end up being invaded (Like if bd14 here, then w c12 -- but in this sequence, b is happy because it aids the attack on f15.) Getting comfortable on the fourth line and using influence to attack might be very profitable for you.]
;W[fg]C[P: W jumps again anyway, even though the move is unforced. At this point, it's big for b to close the corner with d17/d18, or to play d12. Closing the corner leaves w without a base, and d12 cuts down their options in the middle.]

(;B[lc]C[P: This move however puts no pressure on w at all. I suppose you were worried about being counter-attacked around m16. See the variation on this move.

And again, even though this move is the wrong direction, if one is to play here, it's better on the fourth line. The shape here has many defects, notably n16. M16 would have been a much more secure play.]
;W[qc]C[P: This is a strange move by w. It should not be able to survive. Usually, a move like this is played in order to get s15 and s14 in sente, to make a base for stones on the right. But w wants to live... The best w can get is a ko, which is hopeless for w right now with a weak group on the board and b with several ko threats.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob]
(;W[rd]C[P: Variation shows w's usual moves here.]
(;B[qb]C[T: Too small.

P: See variation for ko path];W[re];B[rc];W[qd];B[rb]C[P: W should just take sente now to play elsewhere.]
;W[pe];B[oe]C[T: As my friend said, this "forced" him to play good move. Duh.

P: Well, not really. It also lets you fix your shape in sente. W's moves in the corner were worth about ten points, but taking sente to close the upper left corner or make an enclosure in the lower left is much larger than that. Ending in sente is the only prize worth winning locally. If your friend is happy to take q14 in gote, then you should be happy to let him.]
;W[pf];B[dc]C[P: Huge!!!];W[jm]C[P: W is starting to panic now it seems. This is not a very thoughtful way to play. W chose sequences earlier that gave b walls a q8 and q4 -- in effect, w chose to get eight points in the corner in exchange for whatever b would make in the centre. It's a bit silly to come back and try an unsupported invasion now. Some other ideas for how w should play:

-D17 and d12 are miai -- since b got one of them, w should take the other. They are about equally large and would both help w settle his stones. (If you don't know 'miai', look it up on senseis.xmp.net)
-Play an approach move in the lower left. D6 will do a lot to reduce b's centre.
-WO10. B will almost certainly respond. It's good strategy to play on the line between competing areas of influence -- if b o10, it flattens w out while expanding b's moyo -- wo10 does the reverse. And it's sente for anyone.]
;B[kn]C[P: This move puts too much value on the moyo around n6. Remember, you want to use thickness to attack! And also remember the proverb "play away from thickness". In this case, it means you want to play on the opposite side of w's stone, to force them towards your thick walls. The goal of this is not even so much to kill, as it is to solidify the bottom and the lower left in sente by attacking. I would suggest h7 or h4 as more assertive moves here for b.]
;W[km];B[lm];W[jn];B[ko];W[ll];B[mm];W[ml];B[nl];W[kk]C[P: Now we can actually count the value of the sequence that was just played. The are in the middle is 18 points. W getting to stabilize his group in the centre with good shape after such a hopeless invasion as k7 is much much bigger than 18 points. Better to have had the attack, keep w weak for as long as possible, giving up the 18 points in the middle but making profit everywhere else.

One useful concept is that of "ambient temperature". This refers to the size of a tenuki move on the board. Right now, the ambient temperature is between 10 and 15 points, since moves like d12 and d6 are going unplayed. In contrast. b just spent 5 moves securing 18 points, so about 3 points per move, well below the ambient temperature of the board. When local moves become so much smaller than tenuki, you've got to find a spot to accept a local loss for global gain.]
;B[ik]C[P: This move is a bit directionless. It doesn't interfere with w's eyespace as k9 would, and it doesn't make it harder for w to escape, as m11 or h6 would.]
;W[gm];B[gk]C[p: This move is a result of the previous directionless move. It's important to play here, to keep w's groups separated, but it makes no territory for b. Remember, you want to make territory by attacking! If b had previously played h6, then likely w's next move would have forced b to play around h4, making territory.]
;W[gq]C[P: Because of the directionless moves in the centre, w gets to play in this big area first. However, this move is much too deep, giving b chances to punish w. One line higher at G4 would have been playable for w.]

(;B[cn]C[P: Again, this move lets w off way too easy. See the two variations.]
;W[go]C[P: W will live easily now];B[dq];W[jr];B[kr];W[jq];B[kq]
;W[ip]
(;B[kj]C[P: this point is not actually very important. If you want to attack the w stones in the upper right, you will need to play against them more directly -- g14 peep then h14. See variation]
;W[lj];B[li];W[jk];B[ii];W[ig];B[kg];W[fi];B[ng]C[T: Too small probably. Pestering F17-F11 line better?

P: Your attack in the last few moves has been quite good, but this move is a bit puzzling. Were you trying to make five points of territory around n13? W f11 is an invitation to play D12, which is far larger and continues the attack.]
;W[nh];B[mh];W[nf];B[mg];W[of];B[mf]C[P: Every move in this sequence is worth less than one point, compared to d12 which is fifteen points.]
;W[ch]C[P: W plays in the right direction but again too deep.]

(;B[bj]C[P: See variation for how to punish w's overplay.];W[bh]
;B[bg];W[cg];B[bf];W[cl]C[P: This move is also too deep, but it does expose the weakness of the large knights move bd12-g9]
;B[bl]C[p; Playing on the second line in a situation like this is much too small. Simply play e9, connecting your stones to the centre, and also building the attack on the upper left stones while also threatening to cut off the c8 stone.]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[ck]C[I realized my B10-C10 and B7-8 stones were getting seriously cut down. After oomphing a bit I decided to see if I couldn't connect upper stones to stones at center and save the B7-8 stones toward bottom left.]
;B[cj];W[bk];B[fj];W[em];B[dn];W[el]
(;B[ek]C[p: The sequence from your last comment to here is quite good (even if it lets the c8 stone connect a bit too easily :)). However, this move is unneccessary. W chose to emphasize connecting the c8 stone, and so you need to seize the initiative and attack the upper left stones. This unneccessary move gives the initiative to w. See variation for why it's not necessary.]
;W[al];B[an]C[P: this hanging connections gets you into some trouble later. Better to connect solidly to deactivate the aji of an invasion around c2.]
;W[hj];B[gi];W[hi];B[fh];W[ei];B[hh];W[eh];B[gh];W[ef];B[ih]
C[T: Too cautious probably

P: Yes, this move is not needed.];W[jg];B[jh]C[P: this move secures three points of territory. This is insignificant at this point in the game Compare it to cutting off w's stones with g14 or stealing their base with g18.]
;W[ie];B[jf];W[if];B[je];W[gg]C[P: W lives easily now.];B[hk]
C[T: Too small, too small. The two stones are quite dead already.

p: Yes, this is also unnecessary.];W[hb];B[ib];W[gb];B[eb];W[df]
;B[ce];W[hd];B[rn];W[sq];B[rk];W[pi];B[fr];W[ic];B[jc];W[id]
;B[jb];W[bo];B[bp]C[Lol. Friend has done so often "cut, I protect, he then proceeds to wipe me entirely" stunts that I have started to get more than a bit paranoid so after figuring things out I simply decided to sacrifice those stones rather than risk him invading entire corner or something. Way too cautious. Too often burned by trying to save everything and him doing series of moves I never saw in coming.]
;W[bn];B[co];W[am];B[ap];W[ao]C[p: This sequence is a good reason why the hanging connection was not appropriate. If the sequence to defend is more complicated than what you can read out, it's better to avoid it.

I'm not going to dig into the endgame here, since B is ahead by about thirty points right now. I hope my comments were useful to you. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if you would like to play together on KGS sometime. Good luck!]

)
(;B[np]C[P: I include this move because it seems in line with what you were attempting with n3. A move at o4 does more to emphasize the area around q6 and also does more to protect the corner. However, remember that possible w monkey jump... that combined with the aji of a corner invasion means that this move is the wrong direction. Q3 is much bigger, making a wall towards the k4 stone which is a much larger area than the r8 stones. Variation continues to show how to deal with a w corner invasion now.]
