;C[Joey - Hi, I lost this game by about 20 pts, and I would like to know where are big game points that I missed, also any other gameplay suggestions are appreciated.

Greetings Joey,

My name is Barry and I am about a 15k AGA.  So please don't take my comments as gospel, but I can hopefully give you some pointers that you can incorporate into your game and see some improvement.

The book Five Hundred and One Opening Problems gives the following general questions you should answer when deciding your move in the opening stages of a game..

1.  Is there an urgent move?
     a.  One that makes a base for your stone.
     b.  One that takes away the base of your opponent's stones.
     c.   One that takes the initiative in a certain area.

2.  Is there a big move?      a.  One that extends from your own position.
    b.  One that prevents an extension by your opponent.
    c.  One that threatens an invasion.
    d.  One that prevents an invasion.

3.   Is there a big moyo?
    a.  Do you need to expand or close off your moyo?
    b.  Do you need to erase or invade your opponents moyo?


and remember the motto: "Play urgent points before big points."

  If you have any questions after you read this review, please feel free to contact me.]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[do];W[fp]C[Joey - What are the other typical joseki's regarding the d-5 black stone?

bw- There are numerous joseki variations for this setup.  However, without going into all the different variations, I would only like to comment that this position is still unfinished for both sides  when white moves into a different area.

 A free electronic joseki dictionary is available at Kogo's  http://home1.gte.net/res0kgks/joseki.htm.  This can give you a much better idea of the available joseki's than I could provide.]
;B[fn]C[bw-b's f6  is an unorthodox extension and would not be considered joseki.  You should try to take advantage of this.  One way of doing this is to try to remove the base of the black stones by moving at c4 . See var.]

(;W[hp]SQ[ip][iq]C[bw - h4  is a little tight for an extension.  I think that you could have moved to either of the indicated spots( j3 or j4). White could also respond at c4 taking the corner.(see previous variation)]
;B[qo]C[bw -  Black encloses the corner.  This helps secure some territory but allows you to take sente.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[rd]CR[pg]C[bw - The proper response to b q14 would have been q13.  Black could could have hurt you much more by playing more aggressively.]
;B[qc]
(;W[qh]C[Joey - would it be better if I go Q-12 instead?

bw- no, I don't think so.  see var.];B[rc];W[qe];B[pe];W[el]
C[Joey - Is this approach good/bad?  I was trying to press black while build up some moyo on the left

bw - I would not make a play like this.  The stone neither has a base to help it live, nor are there any white stones which he could use to help it.  At best this play seems premature.   In order to press black like you wanted you need to build up sone unfluence first to help that stone.]
;B[dl];W[di];B[cj];W[dj];B[ck];W[dk];B[dm];W[ci];B[cp];W[cq]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[em];W[fk]C[Joey - Should I just connect at F-8?

bw- Yes I think f8 would have been a better. move.  Your move allowed balck to get good shape and keep sente.]
;B[fl];W[ek];B[gl];W[nc];B[lc];W[jc];B[le];W[je]C[bw - you have a good moyo forming in the corner.  You may want to close it up if you run out of urgent moves.]
;B[jq];W[lq];B[kq]C[bw - This was a heavy move by black.   Take avantage of your secure group go to the center.  Lets take a look at some variations.]

(;W[oq]C[bw - big mistake. I believe that this response left your stones weak.  This invasion did not work out well for you.  You ended up with a weak group that you had to protect and it allowed black to build influence.

you might be able to capture the two black stones or at least make that group stronger by using your other stones on that side.

Always try to avoid making a weak group.];B[nq]
(;W[op]C[bw- try to make the stone at m3 stronger.  Your actions in this battle just allow black to make 2 strong groups]
;B[np];W[pp]C[Joey - Is this a bad move? should I have jumped to the center instead?
bw -  I think your mistake in the initial placement of your first two stones in this area.  Black was able to split you in half and secure territory at the same time.  In this case  you will have to sacrifice some stones.  Since the weakest black stones are at k3 and l3 I would have focused several moves earlier on the stone at m3.]
;B[qp];W[pr];B[qq];W[on];B[qr]
(;W[os]C[bw -better move at o2.  (see var.)];B[lp];W[nr];B[lr]
C[bw- move 58 should have been at o5 instead on n3. ( see var)]

(;W[mq];B[mr];W[mp]C[??? I assume a momentary lapse in concentration.]
;B[mo];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr];B[mm];W[jr]C[bw- This was a small move.  Your group was already safe and there are much bigger points on the board.  Perhaps extending to p8 in an effort to link up.]
;B[kr];W[is];B[in];W[hn];B[hm];W[io];B[jn]C[This group is sealed off.  The remaing moves could have been saved until the endgame.]
;W[jo];B[kn];W[ko];B[lo]C[Joey - I probably shouldn't have had that chase]
;W[qm]C[bw- Good move.];B[pn];W[pm];B[rn];W[po];B[qn];W[ol]

;W[jh];B[jf];W[if];B[ig];W[hg];B[ie];W[hf];B[jd];W[ke];B[kf]

(;W[id]C[bw- You quit a little to early on this one.  You had a great chance to put black on the run by moving a l16 instead.  See the variation for a possibility.]
;B[kd];W[he];B[je];W[hd];B[ep];W[eq];B[fo];W[gp]C[147 bw- At this point I believe that  you have lost unless black makes a big mistake.  Try to count the points during the game.  Than will help you make decisions regarding what chabes to take and which battles to pull back from.]
;B[aq]C[Joey - By now I see I really have to reduce his center moyo, but I ended up not doing a very good job.]
;W[mf];B[me]
(;W[kj];B[ji];W[kh];B[ki];W[mj];B[lj]
(;W[li]C[Joey - Should I have gone to M-9 instead?
bw- Perhaps.  You may have started a ko fight and gained some points.  I t just depends on black would have played it.  Regardless, I don't think it would have been enough.]
;B[lk];W[kk];B[ik];W[km];B[lm];W[im];B[jm];W[gm];B[il];W[gn]
;B[fm];W[rm]C[Joey - I can't see other ways to reduce his moyo in the center now, thus doing some end-game moves.

bw- yes, you are right.];B[sm];W[sl];B[sn];W[rk];B[nm];W[om]
;B[qs];W[or];B[br];W[cr];B[bs]C[bw - You missed a good chance for a few points.  White should play at a2 and catch black's stones in a snapback. (see var.)]

(;W[cs];B[ar];W[ao];B[ap];W[co];B[dp];W[bo]C[bw - The remainder of the game is limited to endgame moves on which I think you did fine.  You played a nice solid game; however, you got a little behind during the opening period and played a little too conservatively to catch up.  Take a look at those general rules at the beginning and that should help you in the opening  to make the most important moves.   I have also been told that the best way to improve yourself when beginning is to study life and death problems.   That will give you more confidence in local fights that can make a differnce during a game.

If you would like to ask me any other questions about this game or would like to send me other games to review, feel free to do so.

Have a nice game.

;W[bh];B[cl];W[ba];B[ac];W[ab]C[bw - If you are going to make a move like this, you need to be ready to follow through with a few ko threats.  Otherwise, you just throwing a point away.]
