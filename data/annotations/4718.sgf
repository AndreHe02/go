[hg:E][bh:G][dk:F]C[[NDK\]
I haven't seen this move here before, responding at B12 seemed too
submissive, but I also didn't want to strengthen white too much because
of a potential attack on H16. Any suggestions?

reid: Hmmm, well,
tenuki is probably not good because white A (B13) is pretty severe. 
How about cutting with B, etc? The ladder is good for black and the
corner stones are already alive, so this seems to be a reasonable fight
for black.  Depending on how the fight goes, black will have good
continuations around E or F.

Simply sliding to G and leaving the white stones with their problems also seems possible.]
;B[ch]LB[em:A]C[reid: this is going to help strengthen white.  If you want to win, you should avoid helping your opponent.

Black
should be figuring out how to work with his existing stones on the
bottom (his largest numerical investment in stones so far).  He would
like things to develop so that a move around A will both attack white
and expand the bottom-side area.];W[di]LB[dg:A][eg:B][eh:C]
C[reid: now is black's last chance to cut with A-C.];B[ci];W[dj]
;B[dg]C[reid:
this is known as 'pushing into the knight's move' and it's rarely a
good idea.  Black should leave this weakness for later.];W[eg]
;B[cj]C[[NDK\] I thought white might tenuki this push to pincer H16.

reid:
white can't tenuki because that would allow black to hane at the head
of three stones.  Besides, why does he want to tenuki when black is
being so helpful?

Looking at the last few moves (starting at
B-C12) we can see that black has gained about 8 points with four stones
(over what he already had here).  White's thickness is worth far more
than two points per stone.];W[dk]LB[em:A]C[reid: white's wall is
now in a position to dominate the rest of this game.  Black can no
longer expect to develop with A (except as a gote move that is too
close to white's thickness)];B[kc]LB[mc:A]C[[NDK\] Now I'm satisfied, although perhaps L17 could be placed slightly differently?

reid:
A (N17) might be better - the corner is big.  But black's problem is
that the white's original invasion (at E16) which should have been a
target, has turned into  thickness that is not attackable. Black has no
leverage left in this game.  His only option is to try to take
territory in gote.];W[qf]LB[hr:A]C[reid: this seems slow for white.
The right side is small because R6 is on the third line - white can't
expect to develop anything big there.  and the black F4 and O4 stones
make it difficult to use white's thickness to make a moyo.  So that
means it's probably time to use the thickness to probe black.  How
about playing A to see how black responds?];B[nc]LB[rd:A][pi:B]
C[reid:
O17 is much too slow (after L17 is already on the board).  Black needs
to take a large corner with A (if he thinks he can win on territory),
or try a pincer around B.];W[rd];B[qc]C[reid: the black stones on the top edge look a bit cramped..]
;W[ph];B[om]C[[NDK\]
I was glad to get this point.];W[pl]C[reid: it's not clear that the
exchange of black P7 for white Q8 is good for black.  Black helps white
settle a large territory.];B[nk];W[oj]C[reid: white has forty
points on the right side, and fifteen in the lower left corner.  Black
has fifteen in the upper left and perhaps fifteen on the top edge.  He
needs to make at least twenty five points out of the bottom while
making sure white gets no more points anywhere.  Black has some concern
about aji near the L17 stone - white would like to engineer some kind
of cut to isolate the H16 stone and use his thickness.];B[em]
LB[gm:A]C[[NDK\] This is looking at a potential cut at C8 or C7 later, while expanding my little moyo.

reid:
Cutting is not really a threat - black will be cutting two live groups.
Pulling back a bit from white's thickness with something around A feels
more appropriate.];W[jk]LB[jl:F][mm:C][gn:D][jn:E][hr:A][lr:B]
C[[NDK\] What's the best way to handle this reduction?

reid:
First off, this feels too shallow for white.  To determine a reduction
point, a good guide is to draw a line between your opponents furthest
outposts (including sente sequences that can extend the outposts).  In
this case, that's O9 and E7.  White could almost certainly go to at
least K8 or J8.

But I don't think reducing is appropriate here. 
We already said that if black gets 25 points he can win the game. 
Reducing will give black at least that much while not giving white very
much in return.

I think white should use his thickness to make a
deep invasion.  After all, black has many weaknesses, including but not
limited to A-D.

I would probably test black by seeing how he
responds to E (K6).  If he tries to cap and kill it with F (K8), I
would be confidant that something would work for white.];B[fh]
;W[gg];B[gi];W[eh];B[ji];W[kj]LB[jo:A]C[reid:
this is a bit heavy.  More interesting might be to do some probing with
a contact play at A (K5).  If white lives inside black's moyo, black
will have a hard time making the G11 and K11 stones work effectively.]
;B[nj];W[ki];B[oi];W[pi];B[jh];W[kh];B[pm];W[qm];B[pk];W[qk]
;B[jg];W[mh]C[reid: white should push again (at L13).];B[nh]
LB[lf:A]C[reid:
black A would also be a good point - now the black top-side is very big
and safe.  If white connects (on dame points), black still has sente.]
;W[ng];B[mg]
(;W[lg]C[reid: too crude for white.  take a look at the sequence  in the variation.]
;B[mf];W[lf];B[me];W[ij]LB[je:A][gk:B]C[reid:
bad move for white.  It just helps black to patch up his weakness.  A
or B is better.];B[hh];W[gk];B[jm]LB[je:A]C[[NDK\] Here my groups
seemed secure and it didn't seem there was much more to profit to be
made by attacking, so I secured some territory, while possibly leaving
some cuts around f9 for white to worry about, depending on how he
responded.

reid: If I were white, I'd be happy to proceed with
at attack at A.  If black played A (instead of K7), he seems to have
enough territory to win, and he has no vulnerable groups.];W[im]
C[[NDK\] White protects his group, but strengthens my territory.]
;B[in];W[dl]LB[je:C][ck:A][hm:B]C[reid:
what is this white move for?  If white really feels the need to play
here, he must at least turn with A.  Of course, white should really
follow up his J7 move with B, or even better, counter-attack with C]
;B[hm];W[gj];B[fj];W[fk];B[bl];W[ie]LB[je:A]C[[NDK\]
I should have looked at this move already, fortunately I found it
didn't capture my centre group!

reid: that's because it should
be at A instead!  A (K15) is much more severe, partly because white B
is sente.  But at this point, black could probably even give up the K13
group and still win the game.];B[he]LB[je:A]C[reid: hmmm, black A looks safer.]

(;W[dd]C[reid: hmmm, white decides that three stones are bigger than ten? see variation.]
;B[fg]LB[kd:A]C[reid: black should atari at A before F13.];W[ol]
;B[nl];W[lc]LB[kd:A][je:B]C[[NDK\] This was big, but unavoidable?

reid: If black has already exchanged A for B, this is not a problem.

But in any case, there is almost nothing black can do at this point to lose this game.]

(;B[md]C[reid:
see variation.];W[ld]C[reid: this is terrible for black.  It would be
better to give up three stones in order to maintain the connection
along the top side.];B[rc];W[gc];B[re]LB[kl:A]C[[NDK\] This might be too small at the moment?

reid: A (L8) would be bigger and reverse sente.  And it would have saved you a lot of trouble later on.]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[rf];B[sd];W[nb];B[ob];W[lb];B[hc]C[[NDK\] After I played, I thought H18 looked better.]
;W[oc];B[pb]LB[od:A]C[reid: atari at a is more direct (and would save you a lot of trouble later).]
;W[mc];B[nd];W[nm];B[ok];W[ql];B[pj];W[qj];B[po]LB[nn:A][on:B]
[no:C]C[[NDK\] This lead to trouble later, is it too much? Where should I play instead?

reid:
white A is still sente, so playing the bad-shape move at B is probably
better.  A is still sente, but now black can answer at C.  White has
only two liberties instead of three or four from Q5.];W[nf]
LB[od:A]C[reid: now is when A instead of Q18 becomes significant.]

(;B[oe];W[nn]
(;B[oo];W[lm]
(;B[kl]C[reid:
it looks to me like the O9 group is weaker than the K7 stone.  So it
seems like playing a stone closer to O9 is better than closer to K7. 
See variation.];W[ll];B[lk];W[lr];B[mr]LB[kq:A][lq:B]C[reid: If
black wants to win the game easily, simply play at A or B.  Even after
white connects along the bottom, he doesn't have enough territory.]

asks me, "how many ways" can black connect this stone?  See variation.]

danger - if white J5, black H5 keeps up the pressure).];W[jq]

;B[hq];W[mq];B[ls];W[js];B[lq];W[cg]C[[NDK\]
I don't think I have any ko threats big enough! And in my short 30s I
reckon I can live on at least one side of B13!];B[mp];W[bg]
C[[NDK\] What's the best way to recover from white's 2 moves in a row here?

reid:
The general rule of thumb is that the corner is bigger and easier to
make life.  I think that's true in this case too.  For one thing, as
you try to live on the side, it damages your territory around F6 a bit.]
