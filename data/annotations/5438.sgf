C[Review for white.
I believe this game mostly illustrates the value of strength, gained in the opening.

/Basti Weidemyr (sestir)

----

I'm white in this game.  I thought I played ok for the most part, did my best in yose, but still lost by 6.5.  I'm looking for ideas on how to handle some local fight more efficiently.  Thank you so much for your input.

(;B[jd];W[fc];B[qc]LB[fc:B][jd:A]C[<s> After exchanging A (k16) for B (f17), black has to find a way to make A useful. The 3-3 invasion makes it weak, and it can not become strong with just one move. I do not think it is possible to play like this.]

(;W[ep]LB[qd:B][ep:A]C[<d> Maybe I should've simply answered the 3-3 invasion (see variation).

<s> yes];B[eq];W[fq];B[dq];W[hp]C[<s> This light shape could be used to get sente.

Any move you choose to play in the top right is enormous.];B[cn]
;W[lq];B[qn];W[po]C[<d> I was going to press with q4 and p3 if he played r5, but he chose to give up the corner, which i think white is a bit better off in this fight.

<s> Yes, the corner is important and R5 would have worked ok for black.

(;B[nq];W[qo]C[<s> This move, R5, feels like cutting cucumber with a big sharp knife. It is a wonderful feeling! Now, white is the chef of this game.]

(;W[mo];B[no];W[mn];B[nn];W[jp]C[<d> Any better way to attack this black stone?

<s> This is not an attack so much as a way for white to link up. It is not so important for white to attack, but to become strong.

I do not want to suggest a different move.]
(;B[kq];W[lr]C[<d> I chose to kill.  Otherwise black lives too comfortably.

<s> You are right.];B[kp];W[jo];B[om];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[pc]
C[<s> White is in trouble. See variations.]
(;W[qd];B[od]C[<s> This shape is very painful for white. If it was a professional game, this would be the possition where white starts to chew on his fan.]

(;W[pf];B[rd];W[pj]C[<d> This is probably the biggest mistake in the game.  I thought I would develop quickly by giving up those two stones.  It ended up cost me quite a bit.  I should've simply play s15.

<s> Maybe. The secret of reaching 1 dan is to avoid situations like this. ^^]

;B[dh];W[bh];B[bk];W[cl];B[dg]
(;W[ek]C[<d> Should I play b10 first?

<s> Yes. b10 makes you strong and black has to connect with g13. It will be a weak connection.

The peep at D5 remains, to seal off the centre or take the corner.]
;B[dl]C[<s> still b10];W[dm];B[bl];W[el];B[bj]C[<s> Time to count ...

black: 60 points.
white: 40 points

White would like to take 20 points with the next move.

;B[he];W[do]C[<s> With your creative strategy and your good feeling for the balance of the game, I believe you have a lot of potential as a go-player.

The only strategic reason to why you lost this game is that you left your stones when they were weak.

I hope this review will help you improve.
Good luck to both players! :)

In this case, we know the black 3-3-invasion was too early. We know the result should be slightly favourable for white. After that, black plays K16, which now looks like a slack move - too close to white's thickness. White's answer at F17 on  the other hand, looks like a sharp move - securing territorry and removing blacks chances at getting a base for K16.

White is ahead by more than komi.]))
