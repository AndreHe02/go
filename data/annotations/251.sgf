  vida 9k*: we have to set a 5.5 komi first
  vida 9k*: i don't know how to do it
  jymon 6k*: you just type "komi 5.5 " (which I did)];B[op]C[
  vida 9k*: it's ok now];W[dc];B[pj]C[dada: Unusual :)];W[pn]L[qp]C[dada: Not good. b has left the corner  open, so you should enter it - 'a' (r4) comes to mind.]
;B[po];W[on]C[dada: As a result of w q6, w must run into the center (without eyes),  while b makes territory.

  Erik 2k*: Q6 should R4];B[mp]C[
  Erik 2k*: this is good for B
  johns 2d*: lets see who knows best what is good for them];W[mn]C[
  Erik 2k*: O7    johns 2d*: o7 is aji-keshi, bud];B[ko]L[fq][fp]C
[dada: seems a little bit too high to me. Maybe you should play a  kakari against the lower left corner at 'a' (f3) or 'b' (f4).]
;W[qk];B[qn];W[qm];B[rn];W[rm];B[qp];W[pk]L[pl]C[dada: I guess playing this move  at 'a' (q8) gives you a better shape for making eyes.]
;B[qj]C[dada: hmm .. don't understand this move - doesn't achieve much]
;W[pf]
(;B[qg]M[pf]C[dada: As w isn't clearly alive at the lower half, you might consider  leaning against that group to gain more thickness to attack the marked w  stone (see variation B).]
;W[qf];B[nh];W[nf]C[
  qing 1d*: T game?];B[ol]M[nf][pf][qf]C[dada: maybe again just leaning against it as shown in the previous  variation and then attack the marked w stones.]
;W[ok];B[nm];W[nn];B[nk]C[
  vida 9k*: thanks!!];W[oj]C[
  vida 9k*: typo
  vida 9k*: sorry :((];B[nj]C[dada: ??];W[oh]C[dada: Good. Now w's weak groups are connected.]
;B[oi];W[pi];B[ni];W[qi]L[ph]C[dada: 'a' (q12) might be an alternative]
;B[pm];W[pl]C[dada: not bad, but you don't have to play this right now. You  could run directly to the center too.]
;B[om];W[mm];B[nl];W[km];B[rj];W[rk];B[ri];W[pg];B[rh];W[rg]C[
  Erik 2k*: wrong    Erik 2k*: B lives];B[rf];W[qh];B[re];W[sh]C[dada: w gets lucky here]
;B[oe];W[ng];B[kj];W[lk];B[lj];W[im];B[jn];W[jm];B[fm]C[dada: ??? b is too weak at the bottom to try  to kill the w group immediatly. A kakari against the lower left corner is  called for. After that b still has got the chance to attack w.]
;W[hn];B[hp];W[hl]L[go]M[fm]C[dada: Maybe playing at 'a' (g5) is better to seperate the  marked b stone.]
;B[fo];W[in];B[jq];W[fl];B[de]C[dada: b shouldn't  leave the fight right now. The b group in the center is still weak and needs  some help.]
;W[fd];B[hc]C[dada: don't like this move];W[cd];B[ed]M[hc]C[dada: with this b weakens the marked b stone and the center group]
;W[ec];B[fe];W[gd];B[gk]L[ik][jk]C[dada: If b wants to attack the w center group, it should  help b's weak group in the center to develop - so a move near 'a' (j9) or 'b'  (k9) might be better.]
;W[gm];B[gl];W[fn];B[em];W[en];B[dm];W[hk];B[gj];W[ii]C[dada: Good - w is seizing the initiative. As b failed to  strengthen the b center group it's easy for w to attack it.]
;B[ij];W[hj];B[ji];W[ih];B[kg];W[jc]L[jd]C[dada: Good - 'a' (k16) looks even better, as  it threatens the center more.]
;B[id]C[dada: b doesn't have time to rescue  this single stone];W[jd];B
[ie];W[je]C[dada: w is happy - b helps to surround  the b center group]
;B[jf];W[jh];B[kh];W[jg];B[ig];W[kf];B[if]L[lf]C[dada: why not  atari at 'a' (m14) instead?]
;W[gi]L[lf][hi]C[dada: Hmm - 'a' (m14) kills  the b center group as far as I can read out. The cut at 'b' (h11) is severe,  but I think b can't capture the four w stones in time (to save the center).  So maybe too timid to protect the cut. But if you're not sure, pla
y it safe.];B[lf];W[ke];B[mk];W[ll];B[lh];W[le];B[fj];W[fi];B[ej];W[ei]
;B[dj]C[dada: Necessary? The upper b stones look weak already.  Maybe save them first.]
;W[di];B[ch];W[ef];B[ci];W[ee]M[fe][ig][if][ie][id][hc][jf]C[dada: Good - now the  marked b stones are captured.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[mc]C[dada: It looks like b doesn't know, what to do next - playing here  and there, but getting nowhere]
;W[lc];B[mi]C[dada: not necessary];W[nd];B[oc];W[od]C[dada: Why?];B[qe]
;W[fg];B[ne]C[
  vida 9k*: oops :(];W[nc]L[me]C[dada: dangerous. You should connect the marked stones with your  living group on the right with 'a' (n15).]
;B[md];W[nb];B[ob];W[lb];B[mb];W[pe];B[na];W[mf]C[dada: w gets lucky again. b missed the chance to  cut the weak w group and maybe rescue the dead stones on the left.]
;B[eq]L[dq]C[dada: why not simply extend to 'a' (d3)?];W[dq];B[dn];W

  wms 5k*: S8 doesn't do anything.];B[tt];W[mg];B[mh];W[tt];B[tt]C[
  vida 9k*: that's it i guess?];C[dada: A good game - after the mistake in the lower right corner  w is behind and has a weak group to look after. But b has a weak group too.
w seizes the initiative and as b doesn't defend the weak center, but plays  some unreasonable moves, w nearly kills the center. As a result w gains big  on the upper side. After b misses a chance to save his stones on the upper  part of the board the game is
 over.])
(;B[ok];W[ol];B[nk];W[nl]L[oj]M[pf]C[dada: Now as b is strengthend,  it's easier to attack the marked w stone. However there's still the weakness  at 'a' (p10).]
