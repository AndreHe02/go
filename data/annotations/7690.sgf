[doitsu\]:

Hi roido.

I am 7k - so basically a beginner like you. So consider everything I say "not absolute". Better players might correct my opinion. Nevertheless I hope my review will be helpful to you.

There are 2 things to think about for players at your strength.

1. You can gain about 3 Stones strength if you just notice moves you simply don't need to reply to locally, but just play somewhere else (-> tenuki).
@see: http://senseis.xmp.net/?TenukiIsAlwaysAnOption

2. The opening and the middle game have a lot more to do with life and death than you can imagine at the moment. Weak groups can be hunted, and the profit that is made during the chase - even if the chase does not result in a big kill, is so big that a game for the "hunted" player is almost lost.
@see:
http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GeneralOpeningPrinciples&page=DoNotCreateTwoWeakGroups


This game was not "comfortably won" by white - it is a complete mess for black. I consider this game "experimental" as you (as a polite player) would usually never play such a game against a (polite) stranger.
The reason is: At a certain stage of the game it should be clear who has won, so either white stops bullying black and wins in a moderate fashion - without massive "overplay" - or black foresees his loss and honestly resigns such a game.

See the "P.S." message at the end of the game.];B[dd];W[pd]
;B[pp];W[ep];B[nc];W[of]LB[of:A]C[[doitsu\]:

I did not see A very often - i think it is extremely unusual.
On the other hand it is good to play the moves you feel to play and not stubbornly play joseki.

To me it looks like white wants to build massive territory, but stones at the 5th line can be easily undermined.]
(;B[qc];W[qd]
(;B[jd]LB[pc:B][qc:A]C[[doitsu\]:

This move is kinda strange. Black A looks useless now - white can immediately solidify himself with B and make thickness in both directions.
Have a look at the variation at move #6.]
(;W[me];B[md];W[oc];B[od];W[oe];B[nd];W[pj]LB[pc:A][qf:C]C[[doitsu\]: I don't like this move. If white wants thickness he can play A again - C would be good shape but leaves black territory and immediate life with Black A.]
;B[dn];W[hp]C[[doitsu\]: Don't give away a corner so easily. A corner means life, life means thickness and thickness means the ability to fight and make territory.]
(;B[pc];W[ci];B[dj]C[Black plays kata-tsuke.

In my opinion this move is a bit too aggressive at this stage?


[doitsu\]:

The shoulder hit is usually a reduction move and considered quite clever.
@see: http://senseis.xmp.net/?ShoulderHit

I believe here is no reason for reduction and therefore the move is precautious and not aggressive. You can keep in mind that (apart from cuts and making someone heavy)
@see -> Example #2: http://senseis.xmp.net/?HeavyExamples

Usually a move is considered aggressive when it keeps a distance of about a one point jump or a keima.
@see: http://senseis.xmp.net/?HowToAttack];W[di]LB[cj:A]C[[doitsu\]:

I think it is the wrong direction. "A" would have been more appropriate here.]
;B[cj];W[df]LB[pe:A]C[[doitsu\]:

"A" is a weakness, too.]
(;B[fe]LB[fe:A]C[Is black being too greedy at the top at expense of security?

[doitsu\]:

Yes - A is not a territory move. A is for influence. I would not play A. But:

White has several weaknesses in his position. White is greedy at the expense of security. And white has far less secure territory at this point of the game while black has good ground at the upper side.

Some ideas which are far from being well understood follow. See move #24.]

Also I would appreciate your thoughts on the difference in strength between these two players? and how many stones handicap should I give him next time?  We are both beginners but I have a bit more experience.

Thank you. I really appreciate any comments.


[doitsu\]:

At a strength at about 15k I would assume about 5 Stones. But at this stage, a player can be easily lured psychologically and just become anxious and therefore do a lot of blunder. I often like Black's style and i think he has a good understanding of strategy - on the other hand he does not seem to know that moves like 145 will get him nowhere, as you also thought. So in a nutshell: I think its 5 Stones, but here i think Black just messed up because he was anxious and depressed by this messy game.


P.S.: This sounds a little harsh maybe. At my time at about 15k I also played such games as White sometimes ... and I am not so sure if it didn't happen lately again :) So I am no better than you or any other beginner :)]
