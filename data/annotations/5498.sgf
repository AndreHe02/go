;B[pp]C[Hello, my name is Joeri and I will be doing the review of this game for the GTL. All my comments will be preceded by [J\]. Please keep in mind that I'm not very strong and my comments are merely experessing my view on the game, not stating facts.]
;W[dp];B[qd];W[dd];B[nc];W[dj];B[qi]LB[pj:A][qj:B][fq:C]C[[J\] It's more common to play at A or B for better balance on the right side. An approach move at C would also be possible]
;W[dg]C[[J\] White solidifies his moyo to early. Black can now take a big point on the lower side, for example K4 or F3.]
;B[cn]C[[J\] This is the wrong direction to approach from, as you are playing into a pincer. White can make black heavy by playing C5 and attack for profit. (See variation for the next move.)]

(;W[dm]C[[J\] Weird move by white.]
(;B[cp]C[[J\] Black should consider pushing at D6 instead. (See variation)]
;W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[cm];W[cl];B[bl];W[ap]C[[J\] White's hane is to early. White should problably play C9 instead.]
;B[ao]C[[J\] This is a mistake for two reasons: 
It doesn't stop white from taking away eyespace, and it is better for black to move out into the center instead of trying to make eyes on the side. Consider D6 or D5 instead.]
;W[bo];B[aq]C[[J\] connecting at C5 is better.];W[co];B[bn]
;W[ap];B[an]
(;W[ar]C[[J\] White makes a big mistake here by capturing a worthless stone. If he would play C9 instead black would be almost dead. (See variation)]
;B[ck];W[cj];B[dl];W[jp];B[lq];W[gp];B[iq]C[[J\] Consider jumping to M5 instead. White may cut of this stone and weaken M3 and Q4 considerably.]

;W[ho];B[em];W[dn]
(;B[en]C[[J\] As you have support for a fight on the right side, cutting at K5 instead would be much better.]
;W[gn];B[fn];W[lr];B[mq];W[gm];B[do]C[[J\] Small. this is an endgame move.]
;W[ep];B[gl]C[[J\] Cutting at K5 is still better. White will almost certainly lose one of the two groups.]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[im];B[il];W[jl];B[qm]C[[J\] White may enter the corner at R3 later. For purposes of closing the corner, R4 or R5 come to mind.]

(;B[sn]C[[J\] Black should have gotten at least a ko. (see variation)]

(;B[mm]C[[J\] Black should consider cutting at K7 instead.]
;W[ln];B[lm]C[[J\] Small. Take a big point at the top instead, such as C17, F17 or K16.]
;W[km];B[mn];W[ll];B[ml];W[ik];B[gj]C[[J\] This move accomplishes very little. Black is already safe, and so is white. The top is still the best area to play in.]
;W[hk];B[gk];W[gg]
(;B[fh]C[[J\] This solidifies white much, while gaining black nothing. I would invade at C17 instead. (see variation)]
;W[fg];B[eh];W[dh];B[ej];W[eg];B[di];W[ci];B[ei];W[dk];B[ek]
;W[jd]C[[J\] This is huge. Compare a white play here with a black one here.]
;B[hc]C[[J\] Wrong place, there is absolutely no room for eyes here.. Consider taking the corner with C17 instead.]

;W[ii];B[lk];W[ld];B[mf];W[le];B[lf]C[[J\] Bad shape, as you suffer from a shortage of liberties. Making the bamboo joint with N13 would have saved you the trouble.]

[or][is][os]C[[J\] I think you should try to look at the whole board and play bigger moves. You got caught up in local play quite often while there were still big points on the board. 

Also, you may want to read up on both the opening and middle game. For the opening I recommend both "Opening theory made easy" by Otake Hideo and "In the beginning" by Ikuro Ishigure. As for the middle game, "Attack and Defence" by Akira Ishida and James Davies is a great read.]
