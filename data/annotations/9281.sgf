AB[pd][dp]C[akilotogo [8k\]: hi there

N: I play as Numsgil (2k) on KGS.  I'll preface my comments with N: in the file.

You made a lot of strategic mistakes in the opening that made the rest of the game an uphill battle.  Don't be too overwhelmed by handicap games; good play in even games is good play in handicap games, especially with 2 and 3 stone games.  Let your opponent make the mistakes.]
;W[dd]C[KyoyaH [10k\]: hi gg];B[pq];W[po];B[np];W[pl]TR[pk]
CR[qq]C[N: This is a problematic move.  Basically it's not light, and it doesn't make your group safe (since it's so open along the third line).  If you want to play lightly, you should play triangle.  Then you can treat all your stones around here lightly.  If you want to make a secure base, you should attach at circle.]
;B[qp]TR[qo]CR[qi][qh]C[N: Black is threatening to scoop out any safety you have along the edge.  Responding at triangle makes you secure, but overconcentrated.  You could also think about responding with something like either circle, which aims to build a base higher up along the edge, and treat that white stone near the corner as light.]
;W[qf]TR[ph][qh][qi][pi][pj][qj]C[N: This is too wide; your group on the bottom of the side is under attach.  If black pincers at any of the triangles, you could have a difficult attack to deal with.  Basically, a pincer would attack both your approaching stone and your group.  Don't let your opponents attack two groups at once.]
;B[nd]TR[qi][pi]CR[rd]C[N: Black is playing passively.  Now is a good time to protect both groups with a stone at either triangle.  You might also want to slide in with circle first, and then take either triangle.]

(;W[kc]C[Here I got excited about being able to jump into my opponents corner from one direction or another without really considering the strength of my own stones.

N: Yeah, you're not strong enough to create a new group.  You still have a lone stone (which you could treat lightly) and a group along the bottom (which isn't really something you can treat lightly anymore), neither of which is strong.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[qj];W[pj]TR[oj]CR[no]C[My plan here was to take the outside and join my two weak groups together, this failed rather badly.

N: You're in a tight spot here.  You'll need to sacrifice something if you want to get a good result.  You could play at triangle and chase black a tiny bit.  You'd probably lose the stones at R14 and any territory along the edge, but hopefully center thickness would be reasonable compensation.

Aleternatively you could set up a leaning attack at circle, but black is going to get a lot of territory along the bottom, so that might not pay for itself either.]
;B[pi];W[qk]TR[qi]CR[qo]C[N: I think you should cross cut here (triangle).  This is a handicap game and you're in a rough spot, so better to invite complications.  Plus, this move still doesn't let this group live.  You'll need to descend to circle very soon.]
;B[oj];W[qi]C[N: Too late to try this.  Offering black a ponuki is a bad idea.]
;B[rj];W[rk];B[pk];W[qm];B[ol];W[om];B[nl];W[qo]C[N: Coming back to do this is painful but necessary :(]
;B[mc];W[qc]TR[cn]C[N: Too soon.  The stones along the right side are a lost cause, so just tenuki from the whole area and play something like triangle.]
;B[pc]TR[qd][rd][re]C[N: Black should have played one of triangles (the exact one depending on how brave he is), to ensure the stones on the right stay unsettled and heavy.  Although even if you get a bit of a base here, I still don't think you're alive.]
;W[re];B[cf]C[N: Black is tenuki'ing from an important fight.  Take the opportunity to secure life for your stones on the right.]
;W[gc]TR[ch]C[N: Too wishy-washy.  It doesn't help the stone on the right very much, and it doesn't help the corner very much.  Given the board state, you should pincer to prevent black from getting a moyo.]
;B[cc];W[dc]TR[cd]C[N: Wrong side.  Block at triangle and build up center thickness.]
;B[ci]C[N: Black is treating the 3-3 invasion as a probe, but I think finishing the joseki is bigger than this.]

(;W[qd]TR[qb]C[N: Better to play at triangle.  See variation.]

;B[fp];W[bo];B[cd];W[gq];B[gp];W[nm];B[pb];W[ml];B[mk];W[ll]
TR[mm]C[N: Careful, leaving a cut like this is dangerous.  Have you read out all the variations to see if the cut works right now?]
;B[of];W[ke];B[de];W[ln]TR[mn]C[N: Better to be at triangle and protect the cut properly.  This leaves a tiny bit of aji.]
;B[kp];W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[mq];W[no];B[hr];W[fr];B[og];W[qh]
;B[ph];W[rg];B[lk];W[kk]C[N: again, are you sure you can handle a cut from black?  Does the hane give you anything to compensate for the risk of getting cut?  (Hint: no, not really.  Your stones on the top can still reduce black's moyo here.  And extending straight vs. hane give the same level of incursion towards the left.]
;B[nk];W[lg];B[kj];W[li]TR[kl]C[N: You're playing a dangerous game.  If black cuts at triangle, you're mostly cut off from the left.]
;B[ki];W[kh];B[jh];W[jg];B[bn];W[co];B[lj];W[ih];B[ed]TR[ji]
C[N: I think the ponuki at triangle is bigger than these few stones.]

;W[ji]C[N: Yes, this was very important.];B[jk]C[N: This stone has lost most of its value once you got the ponuki.  You should continue reducing black's moyo.]

N: You'll have to do something like this eventually, but there's no rush yet.  Play other points first.]
