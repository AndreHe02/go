C[This game was played on March 5, 2009, on IGS.

B: Enock 15k
W: vernon 15k

Although W won this game by 9.5, he should have lost by about 30 points.

  Question for reviewer: what moves in the opening for W caused the inferior situation?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi my name is Tom. I go by RazorBrain on all fo the go servers. My comments will be preceded by RB>>]
;B[pd]C[*Enock*: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.
vernon: hi];W[dq];B[do]
(;W[co]C[RB>> I don't have a problem with this move or even the sequence of the avalanche joseki, but I wanted to point out that tenuki is also possible here. I think tenuki robs black of some of his initiative. By playing out htis joseki I think black gains from his unchallenged control of shaping the opening. [See variation\]]
;B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[cq];B[dn];W[cm]C[vernon: Straight out of "38 basic joseki".]
;B[kq]C[RB>> Now white faces a dilemma--to play in the lower right or play in the upper left. Now, without a stone in teh lower left it feels more like an invasion than an opening. I think this leaves black with an emotional advantage at a bare minimum.]
;W[qp]C[vernon: Was this a good move? Should I have played on the 4-4 point, or perhaps Q3? Or attacked the black wall in the lower left?

RB>> I don't know that it matters which corner position. There are options for white no matter what. However, the 4-4 point would yield more influence and I think that would be helpful for white. But the objective here is to get a position in this corner. I think you can do that on a 3-4 as well as the 4-4. For me it is just important to get into the lower right before black plays there again. Now if I were black I would play the upper left to further pressure white strategically.]
;B[nq]C[RB>> This is small for black and cowardly in my opinion. Now white should take the uppoer left. If black attacks white can play to live in the corner.]
;W[oq]C[RB>> this is too severe in my opinion. Playing contact here invites a fight that I think will benefit black more than white.]
;B[qj];W[ql]C[vernon: Although cramped, I thought it was better than not playing. Would grabbing the open corner have been better?

RB>> The corner is not really open, so I wouldn't have played again in the corner. Honestly, the upper left is still screaming for someone to notice it. It is bigger than R8. I'm not saying ignore R8 or another move in the bottom right. I only suggesting that the timing could be better. 

One thing to consider with this play is that if you compare black's R10 move to White's R8 move black gains in this exchange. WHite must find a way to get something as big as black or he is surely falling behind.

[See continuation\]]
(;B[ce]C[RB>> Now black get's the first move in teh upper left. So far white has let black gain an early strategice lead. The pressure is on for white now.]
;W[dc];B[dd]
(;W[cc]C[Moving into the corner give's black an opportunity to seal white in. White must keep his options open on the top. [See variation\]]

(;B[ed];W[ec];B[fc]C[vernon: At this point, I felt that B was ahead.

RB>> Agreed.

BTW this position is similar to the variations I pointed out. This  still shows a case for white to draw back to E17 first before playing into the corner, even though I might have played hane as black earlier. This leaves black with so much influence that white should be worried.]
;W[ci]TR[kd]C[vernon: I played here to keep the wall at C15 from making territory.

RB>> I understand your logic here but stop and ask yourself if you really gained from this. You stop black from staking out territory on the left but he can just make it on the top instead and if you let black playnear L16 he not only makes territory, he also threatens to take the entire uppoer right quadrant.

White needs to play into this area first.];B[jc]C[RB>> Not my preference of moves for black but it is the right idea.]
;W[qf]C[RB>> An unenviable invasion for white but courageous and necessary!]

(;B[qe]C[RB>> As black I would have played to strengthen the R10 stone. yes this let's white live in the corner, but it pressuresthe R8 stone and makes gains. [See variation\]]
;W[pf];B[of]C[RB>>  ???]
(;W[og];B[nf]
(;W[ph]C[vernon: B has staked out a large upper side, but W is threatening to take the right side.

RB>> True whtie's position is looking better but black can still run and and potential split white's position. So white must proceed carefully.]

(;B[rg];W[rf];B[re];W[sg]C[vernon: How could W have done better here?]
;B[sh];W[sf];B[qh]
(;W[rk]C[vernon: I was trying to kill S13, but this move, while robbing B of eye space, allows the attack on the other side to succeed. Would Q11 have been a better move?

RB>> This isn't a bad move, but again it is premature. a little preparation would have made all the difference here. [See variation\].]
;B[pi];W[oi];B[oj]
(;W[pk]C[vernon: I thought this would keep S13 from getting eyes, but he has the liberties to attack Q14. Was there a better move?

RB>> The problem is that at this point black has already escaped. WHite must now play to save his upper group. [see variation.\]]
;B[ni];W[oh];B[nh];W[pj];B[qi];W[si]
(;B[pg]C[vernon: I viewed this as a mistake on B's part that allows W to save half of his group. See variation.]
;W[rh];B[qg];W[sj]C[vernon: I lost P13, but saved Q14. W is behind, but B should have captured them all.

RB>> meager comfort. black's strategic position now is huge and white's uppoer right side has been flattened]
;B[ok];W[ol];B[nl];W[nk];B[nj];W[nm];B[ml];W[om];B[mm]
(;W[ei]C[vernon: I felt that B was walling in the center, so I needed to thrust into it.

RB>> Yes you judge the situation well, but I think E11 is slow. A bigger thrust is needed. How about trying some forcing moves to get a few stones out in the center and then play to connect them. Don't worry if you lose the stones. They are all about potential. The answering moves do not gain black anything. SO, if you lose the stones it does not hurt you. [See variation\]]
;B[dm];W[cl];B[dl];W[dk];B[ek];W[ej];B[fj];W[hq]C[vernon: I got desparate and decided to jump into his surrounded territory to try to reduce it. This stone might try to escape either to the left or right. Was this crazy?

RB>> yes ;-)];B[fr];W[ko];B[mn];W[np];B[mp];W[mq];B[lq];W[nr]
C[vernon: I have not saved H3, but I gained territory on the lower right. I get more desparate.]
;B[lo];W[fk];B[el];W[gk];B[fi];W[gn]C[RB>> I am scared for white. All advantages are black's]
;B[dj];W[ck];B[eh];W[di];B[dh];W[fo]C[vernon: I am trying to connect H3 to F9, and maybe break through at E4.]
;B[gp];W[hp];B[go];W[ho];B[fp];W[fn]
(;B[hr]C[vernon: I thought this was unnecessary. He should split me at H6.

RB>> I agree.];W[in];B[hm];W[im];B[hl];W[il];B[hk];W[hn];B[hj]
;W[ir]C[vernon: Now W has a lot of eye potential around J5, and W might get an eye at H2.

RB>> One eye is not enough however :)];B[gl]C[vernon: I thought this move was weak. He should extend to G2 to deny me the eye.]
;W[jp];B[kn];W[jn];B[kp];W[jo];B[km]C[vernon: Another bad move. He should have played G2. I now get the eye at H2.

RB>>  correct];W[gr];B[gq];W[hs]C[RB>> You were fortunate. I think this white group should have died. No that assumes perhaps a stronger black opponent. however, I want you to see why despite the outcome why this is dangerous and not something to practice.]
;B[jj];W[jk];B[kk];W[mc]C[vernon: B's territory is still enormous. I decide that he is not so strong after all, and that I might be able to use the potential around Q14.

RB>> What if black closes the corner. White will get something, but black can avoid the damage he allows in the game.]

(;B[ld]C[RB>>  see variation]
(;W[pc]C[RB>> See variation for an option to this contact play.]
;B[oc];W[qc];B[nd];W[rd]C[vernon: after this move, I cannot find a variation for B to kill W in the corner. If T15, then P18, and vice versa.

RB>>  Good job on this!];B[pb];W[qb]C[vernon: I am now almost certainly alive.]
;B[oa];W[se];B[fb];W[eb];B[ch];W[bd];B[be];W[bi];B[bh];W[je]
C[vernon: B is still ahead. I try another jump in. This one is a long failure.]

;B[jl];W[dr];B[on]C[vernon: I thought I could not cut this B move off with O6, but the following variation indicates that I could have.]

(;W[pn]C[vernon: See variation. Apparently I could have captured this stone.]
;B[nn];W[po];B[oo];W[op];B[mr];W[nq];B[iq]C[vernon: here is a series of bad moves by B.]
;W[jq];B[jr];W[kr];B[ks];W[js];B[lr];W[jr];B[es];W[er]C[vernon: if the center group had had only two near eyes, this could have lost the center W group.]

;W[hr];B[cd];W[bc];B[cn];W[bn];B[ep];W[ds];B[qa];W[ra];B[qd]
;W[rc];B[rl]C[vernon: Here begins the sequence that leads to B's undoing. He forgets that he has not yet captured P13.

RB>> Greedy of black. He's ahead by 25 points. No need to invade. A good lesson in this I think :)]
;W[qk];B[pm];W[pl];B[sl];W[qm];B[sa];W[rb];B[sb];W[sd];B[ri]
C[vernon: B lost the game, but W did not win it. This is the losing move, with B about 10 points ahead.

RB>> More greed coupled with a little thoughtlessness (which is still my favorite way to lose big ;-) Black want's it all. 15-25 points doesn't seem to be enough to make him happy.]

;B[fh];W[eo];B[tt];W[tt]C[RB>> Vernon, I'm glad you took the time to analyze your game like this. I can tell from your comments that you learned a lot from doing this. Keep that up. It will help a lot. 

Overall, I maintain that all your troubles started in the opening as I think you know. Hopefully, some of the options I offer there will give you ideas for other games as white. 

Good job on hanging in there though. Blakc's less that solid play gave you the right to continue to push this one until, as noted, his own greed and thoughtlessness got him. Had he played more solidly and conservatively after the opening I think you would have been forced to resign by the late middle game. But, your ability to push him paid off. 

Thanks for the opportunity to review and comment on your game. Please contact me directly if you ahve any follow-on questions or comments.
