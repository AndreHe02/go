C[No questions or area's of special interest whatsoever makes it difficult to review since there are many things on which to focus. 

I will do a general review. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

Lothar.];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[eq];B[nc]C[O17 for B is unusual I could not find a professional game where it was played. Mostly played are B P3 and B C3 or C4.

I'm unfamiliar with this opening at all so I had to some research. P3 makes sense as corner enclosures especially from the 3-4 point are considered to be very big.]
;W[qj];B[cj]C[B C10 seems slow, better to play C4 or P4 or even R12]
;W[op]C[W P4 is a logical move.]
(;B[qm]C[Extending towards R10 doesn't seem to be the right order also one point too far.  See var.]
;W[om]C[W P7 keeps B out of the center.];B[pq]C[Because of B R7 being too far from R4 B can't play P4 and W has an easy time confining B to the side of the board.]
;W[oq]C[Good exchange for W.];B[kq]C[B L3 is a problematic move. if at all then I'ld prefer K3. But the thing to remember is to stay away from strength and although it's just a small wall it's better not to attack here because W will pincer with J3.
There are other moves like C14 or R12 or C4.]
(;W[iq]C[Good move by W but see the var. for right order. The idea is to make a bigger wall and push B against it.]
;B[nr]C[B L5 will do. Or  if your looking for a good fight you can go for B G3.]
;W[or];B[mq]C[B wasted 3 moves to create a nice wall for W and for himself a weak group.]

(;W[mo]C[Wrong side to attack.  See var. Again; push B against the wall. Now W is pushing B into his moyo.]

(;B[jp]C[Before running make some eyespace. See var.];W[ip]
;B[cp]C[Good move wrong timing. B should safe his weak group; L6]
;W[do]C[W should tenuki and attack B's weak center bottom group with K6.]

(;B[co]C[B should take the corner. see var.];W[dn];B[dp];W[ep]
;B[cm]
(;W[fo]C[Overplay by W. Read it out!];B[lr]C[B: Why not break out first ?]
;W[jo]C[W: too close K6 better];B[ko]
(;W[lp]C[W: bad move.];B[kp];W[qf];B[pk]C[B: useless. There are better moves to play; C14, K6, R12]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[cg];B[jc]C[B: it's in the right direction but not far enough. F17 is the only move here]
;W[of]
(;B[qe]C[B: these are thank-you-moves. W is happy to connect and strengthen his shape. Think of Q13 and then R12]
;W[re];B[oe]C[B: same same.];W[nf]
(;B[pi]C[B: very bad move. B is inviting W to split him. See var.]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[ok];B[mh]C[B: another weak group.]
;W[lf]C[W: also possible to connect with R11];B[mk];W[qi];B[pg]
C[B: No point in palying these moves. They just make W's shape stronger.]
;W[pf];B[ne]C[B: Too small. Invade W's corner C17. Or F17.]
;W[qg]C[W: overplay B could not cut.];B[ph]C[B: it's just a stone. there are much bigger moves.]
;W[gc]C[W: good move.];B[ld]C[B: again too small think of C17 for instance.]
;W[dk]C[W: good idea.];B[ck];W[dj];B[dm];W[em];B[kj];W[dl];B[cl]
;W[di]C[W: Nice wall but what to do with it ? Better K6.];B[kg]
C[B: W is alive. Better are K6 or C17];W[cd]C[W: good move]
;B[hj]C[B: good move reducing the power of the W wall and building territory.]
;W[qr]C[W: seems small but B must answer.];B[rq]C[B: Good move]
;W[rr];B[qk];W[jn]C[W: K6 is the move.];B[kn]C[B: wrong side, J8 or even J9.]
;W[mm]C[W: not sente and the group was alive anyway so G14 or H8.]
;B[jm]C[B: good move.];W[im];B[in]C[B no need to sacrifice just play the double hane]
;W[io];B[il];W[hm];B[hl];W[gm];B[gl]C[B: one too many like w D11 before.]
;W[gg]C[W: good idea but not quite on the spot G14 is better because B G15.]
;B[he]C[B: this doesnt do the job but merely secures W's territory. G15 was the move.]
;W[ig]C[W: Why not G15 ?];B[jh]C[B: No need to answer better F15.]
;W[jf]C[W: useless better G15];B[id]C[B: H16 is also possible.]
;W[fe];B[gd];W[fd];B[hc];W[gb];B[hb];W[rc];B[qb];W[cr]C[W: good move.]

(;B[bq]C[B: too timid. play B2. See var.];W[me];B[md];W[ih]
;B[ii];W[ll];B[kl]C[B: Good to stay connected.];W[lk];B[lj]
;W[kk];B[jk];W[lm];B[km];W[sp]
(;B[ro]C[B: See var.];W[qq]C[From here it's just endgame moves so I stopped making comments.

W had an easy win because B failed to invaded his big moyo in the upper left corner.

Both B and W have a tendency to attack groups that are alive and play moves that are simply not necessary. Always play the biggest move! Also improve your reading! 

Good luck!
