C[>This game was played at IGS. I'm more strong than my opponent(i'm 15k, but i'm stronger, may be 14, and he is 16k) but i've lost several games with him.
May be i dont like to play near thickness or in my opponent's moyo. It would be nice to sign out my strategic mistakes and defects in my shapes.

Hi, I hope you enjoy and learn from this review. Just remember that there are many go players much stronger than me.

I think you really have to focus on looking for urgent points. Big points are nice, but if your opponent gets an urgent point that you should have, your earlier stones can become ineffective or a liability that has to be cared for while he gets free points.

Also, you may get much benefit from studying some tactical problems.]

;W[dd];B[ed];W[db]C[You could have cut at E17, so this is a "thank you move".]

;W[jd]C[I can see why you would want to play here, since it would be an ideal point for black. However, there are still unresolved issues in both top corners. It also seems that you should not have played to give black a strong shape in the upper right if you wanted to play in this area immediately.

Furthermore, are you ready for the fight after a black cap at k14?]

;B[ol];W[kg]C[Too slow, and doesn't really build eyeshape. Just jump to k12 instead.]

Yes, the weakness at Q8 is more important.];B[mk];W[lj];B[pn]
;W[on];B[pl];W[qm];B[ql];W[qn];B[nn];W[oo];B[rl];W[cq]C[This is not urgent; your center group is still eyeless.]
;B[bo];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gr];W[bq];B[cg]C[This is a very big point. The group around C8 is starting to look weak.]
;W[ej];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[cf];W[cd];B[ic]C[>i almost lost my territory at left top corner. Had i make D13 or so move earlier?

D13 was big, but you also left other urgent points on the board.]

That makes this area huge until it is resolved. If Black gets here first, the game is over.]
;W[ib];B[hc];W[nq]C[Again, you don't have time for moves like this.]
;B[jq];W[fn];B[hb];W[hg]C[Trying to counterattack is at least a good attitude, but this can be cut, and induces Black into pushing you against his strong stones.]
