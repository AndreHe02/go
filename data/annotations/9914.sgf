Hello, this is Tinwen, I am 2k EGF player, and I am making review for the white side. 

In this game there were a few counting mistakes, yet what showed critical was the strategy of the players. White had plans to attack in the fuseki, but couldn't follow up on them and gave black a lot of thickness. After that, there were one or two chances to catch up, which I try to point at. I give variations for strategy and tactics.

There is a summary at move 174. Enjoy the reading.

T: Have a look at http://josekipedia.com/, if you need a joseki. Here, I would choose A instead, because of the upper left black corner.]

(;B[qb];W[ic];B[qh]C[i wasn't entirely sure how to respond here. i thougth going under and making a base would be a good idea

T: You do not want to give black more thickness then necessary to cooperate with his lower right corner. That is why I would try to get out  immediatelly.]

(;W[rh];B[ri];W[rg];B[ph];W[of]TR[ph][qh][ri][pp]C[decided I needed to pop out because being surrounded is never a good thing


T: Good idea, but if you need to play this now, then S12 was wrong. Black got thickness, and you cannot attack the triangled area now.]

;B[pn];W[nq]TR[no]SQ[dj][dm][ep]C[I felt happy after this exchange

T: Triangle doesn't do much. 
Now black should take one of the marked points to prevent white from building a moyo. Black is ahead on points, so that is really all he has to do.]

T: Understandably, he took points in sente. Actually, the result might be equal locally, you have massive thickness. But if he protects the upper left corner now, there is nowhere to attack. So the board position is not good for you.]

(;B[jl]LB[cc:B][ci:A]TR[ei][ej]SQ[cf]C[T: This is nearly a pass. 
You want to extend all the way towards the corner (square) from your immense thickness. 

Note, that you can with no move whatsoever secure the area aroud the triangles as your territory. You can expect to get either some points on the left around A, or the corner B, not both.]

T: That's a pitty. It is alive, read it out for yourself. Time issues? 
Still, even if you play the big endgame moves, the game has been pretty much decided already.]
;B[or]C[huge move and in sente as well, wish i saw this earlier]
;W[ns]LB[cf:6][mf:2][rh:1][dj:3][gp:5][mp:4]TR[lg][mg][no]SQ[ph]
[qh][ri][qj][pp]C[T: In this game, the main topic for white was strategy in the fuseki and middle game. 
In the opening, white allowed black to make incredible thickness with the move 1, and furthermore let his group enclose in gote with the move 2. White also lost two key stones on triangle. With the squared structure, black was already in the lead and white already had to be smart to turn the game around. 
There was a chance for white to make a moyo by playing around 3, the big area which both players missed. There was another chance to complicate the game punish black overplay invasion which began with black 4, or to punish the tactical overplay 5. Finally, white didn't extend from his thickness all the way to 6, which would be correct, but due to black mistakes probably wouldn't give a better result then the game. 

My advise to white would be to watch out for giving the oponent too much thickness. Another point for him is to focus more on where he makes points and less on the oponent. White might want to try out a more loose style of making his own mojo. Both of this might help eliminate moves like O5 and play moves like 3 and 6. 

The review ends here. Thank you for your attention.];B[bq]C[another huge move as well]
