C[I have two questions about this game.

1) My opponent played some (for me) novel moves in the lower left.  How does one
play against this?

2) My opponent fell into my sanrensei trap, but somehow I didn't build a big enough
moyo out of it anyway.  Was I playing slow moves that messed up my moyo somehow?   What should I have done differently?

;W[qq]LB[no:A]C[This is what I mean.  The sanrensei book says white should play A, not this.

*schorsch*:
In general, w is free to jump to the 3 3 point when b stands on 4 4.
Whether this is a good idea or not needs to be shown in each situation
in a game. W will live almost in any case in the corner, but b will get
thickness outside, which is often worth more.];B[qp]C[*schorsch*:
Now if the jump happens, then b usually wants to cut at q3.
You need to be *very* sure to make lots of territory along the right
edge if you want to justify closing the corner from above. In this
situation here the san ren sei is still completely open to invasion,
so it would probably be better to seperate the w stones.];W[pq]
;B[op];W[oq];B[mo]C[Is this the correct followup move?

*schorsch*:
Yes, looks ok, once you are in this position.];W[np];B[no];W[rp]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[lr]C[*schorsch*:
W basically played a sequence of end game moves here, securing
15 points in gote. This forced b to build a thick wall towards his
potential territory. Say thanks!
Note that the w stones in this corner will not contribute anything
to the course of the remaining game. This strongly contrasts to
the active future role of the b wall. Now you see the main reason
why w normally walks to the center instead of taking the corner.]
;B[jd]LB[ic:A][fc:B][lc:C]C[Appropriate move?

*schorsch*:
Stronger players like to play something like A, which gives a choice of
good follow up moves between b and c (whichever w takes, take the other).
Both combinations lead to an optimal basis position, even if they may
be considered defensive.
This principle of choice between follow up moves is called "miai",
and is a very important concept when selecting moves. always try
to think about the next following move before placing the current one.

The move played is definitively not wrong though. It exhibits greater
influence toward the center, but is less stable when attacked.]
;W[jq];B[fc]LB[cj:A][cn:B]C[Is this smaller than A? How about B?  Anything even bigger than that?

*schorsch*:
First of all, b recognized correctly that the w move doesn't call
for an answer.
A, B and the played move are all big and important. This choice
is mostly a matter of style and further plans on how to follow up.
(Note the miai potential in A!)];W[df];B[db];W[cc]
(;B[hd]LB[fe:A]C[*schorsch*:
This is the first really weak move by b.

Your intention is to build a mojo in the center. Why do you play
a move that has the *only* purpose of securing the upper edge?

For most players, A would be a no-brainer. It secures the top at
least as good, and gets you much more influence targetet at
the center (while securing more territory in any case, even if
you should lose the center).

There are still more good moves to consider along the left edge.]
;W[cj];B[jj]C[Appropriate?

*schorsch*:
Assume you had H16 at F15. Would you still consider playing this?

Given the current position, this is just a single-purpose move.
Your stone has no effect at all upon the w stones, which means that
w doesn't need to answer it directly. Try to play your moves
in a way that forces w to react directly, while still keeping your
overall goal (a center mojo) in the back of your mind.
I have inserted a short variation at node 26 to demonstrate
the possibilities.];W[ej]C[*schorsch*:
You can almost hear w thinking now: "if you take territory, then I
can do that just as well, but I'll make it a lot more secure!"]
;B[jp]LB[ho:A]C[*schorsch*:
Probably much too slow. Attaching to the w stone will force w
to stretch, thus strenghtening the w position. Something like A extends
the b influence a lot more, means more danger to the potential
w territory at the bottom, and brings you closer to the w corner.
It does all this without unnecessarily strengthening the w position.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[hp];B[ho];W[gp];B[go];W[fo];B[hl]LB[fn:A]C[*schorsch*:
The last ten moves brought about 20 points of secure territory
for w, and only about 10 for b.
In addition to that, they made the w corner *very* hard to invade.

Under those circumstances, H8 looks a bit too defensive. Once the
w corner is closed, b might just as well try to reduce a little of the
left side with A. There will still be time after this to close the mojo
towards the center stone.];W[fn]C[*schorsch*:
You will notice later how inconvenient this w stone is for b.
Wouldn't b be a lot happier with one of *his* stones there?]
;B[cq]C[The lower left corner starts];W[dr]LB[bo:A][dm:B][cm:C]
[dl:D]C[I don't believe I've ever seen this before. What should black do?
Why doesn't white always play this against a 3-3 invasion?

*schorsch*:
W can only play this if he has this very strong position along the
lower edge that makes it impossible for b to capture D4.
I'm not sure if b can live here without tricks, but if you want
to try, something like A might be worth a try. Even B,C or D look
interesting, as they create a double threat, possibly connecting
to the center or to the corner.

In any case, you'd need to gain as much space as fast as possible
to get a slight chance for survival, being prepared to sacrifice
a few stones in the process.];B[dq];W[er];B[cr];W[bp];B[cp]

;B[mb]LB[nb:A]C[*schorsch*:
Why so shy? b A is a strong move, forcing w to connect his stones,
and closing them off much more consequently.];W[re];B[rf];W[rd]
;B[qg]C[*schorsch*:
This move is not necessarily needed, if you are willing to give way
a little when w pushes, losing 2 or 3 points. There are still much
bigger moves available on the board!];W[nb];B[mc];W[ma];B[la]
;W[na];B[kb]LB[lb:A]C[*schorsch*:
As a general principle: If you connect a hane stone at the edge
of the board, do it at A, unless you desperately need eye shape.
This b group is in no danger of running out of eyes soon, so you
should avoid to create ko threats for w's use later in the game.]
;W[cb];B[hg]C[*schorsch*:
Doesn't b wish now he had played F15 earlier on?

Again, the move played is a single purpose move, which needn't
bother w at all.];W[fg];B[mj]C[*schorsch*:
Eeek! Why ???

Did you fear that w might play exactly there the next move?]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[ec];B[kq]LB[ea:A]C[*schorsch*:
Although this move is very strong sente, it's only worth 1 (one)
point. Consider A instead, and compare the result with what
b really gets up there a few moves later.];W[kr];B[gj];W[fd]

(;B[gc]LB[gd:A]C[*schorsch*:
Why not A? This shape looks so ugly, it can only be bad. You will
see why in the next few moves.

*schorsch*:
This would be the right time to count the score, and avoid a ko
fight that won't help you win the game (actually an option to
consider for both players!).

It is very important to realize that counting often during a game
will improve your play significantly. If you know exactly where
you stand, then you have a much better judgement of what
kind of risk you can afford or need to take. Counting by eye
seems pretty hard when you try it first, but will become
second nature soon.];B[gj];W[oc];B[od];W[hj];B[bs];W[ar];B[gj]

(;B[fe];W[cj];B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[dh];B[ho]C[*schorsch*:
Would you still consider playing K10 now?

Note that if w starts to invade the center now (he should!),
then you will keep the w center group seperated from the other
w stones. Living in the center is quite difficult, so you can close
the circle around them relatively easily. Once the w group
comes close to live in the center, you will have built up
enough strength to destroy the w potential in the lower left
of the board almost completely. You should not stick to your
initial goal (the mojo) too hard. If w wants to live in the center,
don't try to kill him too hard. Just keep him busy and small,
and use the stones you place to build a wall, so you build up
enough strength to attack the other w groups in the end.
This (hypothetical) scenario would still result in a close game!]
