C[Hi. Thx for the review. I cutted the game so you can focus on Fuseki. My questions should guide u.

forfun (hereafter "ff") - Thanks for an interesting game to review. I think that the main point of this game for Black is the need to consider well the nature of the overall position: who is strong where, who has opportunities to build or destroy territory where, etc. Based on such considerations Black needs to improve the selection of moves so that they are more relevent to the board. In this game Black made a variety of "book" moves that were not really appropriate. Let's dive in and see what I mean...]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dp];B[cn]C[ff - This is relatively unusual versus P4 in professional Go, but we can not say it is worse.]
;W[dj];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq];W[eq];B[cp];W[gq]
(;B[op]C[ff - Black might also consider approaching from the right. See the variation...]
;W[lp]
(;B[pm]C[rs: anything against this joseki here?

ff - The main point of this position is that Black can not expect to invade behind the pincer stone on M4. In such a case Black would prefer to make something of the right side. The normal joseki, as in the game, has White cutting off this stone. In this game, the result does not seem very good for Black. See the variations for some other ideas...]
;W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[pp];W[qn];B[qq];W[qo]
(;B[nn]C[ff - The normal move, but is it best here? See the variation...]
;W[om];B[rq]C[ff - Although the ladder favors Black, it is not clear what Black expects to achieve with this joseki. See the variation on White's next move...]
(;W[qi]C[ff - I think White is happier than Black at this point. See also the variation...]
(;B[qg]LB[ln:A]C[rs: I don't know if my move was the best one. I guess it was ok, but what do u think about A instead? Better or a question of taste?

ff - Again, the probem for Black here is that the bottom is just not that big. As a result, playing "A" has the potential to be too small. If Black feels A is necessary now, then better to have played O6 at O3 as shown in the variation on Black 25.]
;W[ln]C[ff - This threatens to cut at O4 and capture the two stones. Should Black connect? What strategic importance does Black see in the two Black stones at O5? Are they cutting stones? Will they build territory in the future or play an important role in attacking White? Those are the things we need to keep in mind.]
(;B[jd]C[ff - This looks like a classic, "big point versus urgent point". See the variations...]
(;W[nm]C[ff - This seems like a serious mistake by White. Why not cut at O4 and eat the two stones directly?]
(;B[mq]C[ff - The shape that results here is bad for Black. Generally speaking though, the two stones have no meaning after White's O7. Black should just play elsewhere.]
;W[lq]
(;B[cf]C[rs: is it OK to develop the star points this way?

ff - The future of D10 is a significant question. I think Black would prefer to play high at D14 or even D13 here. That threatens to play around D8 next, attacking D10. Presumably White will do something with D10, in which case Black will be able to play next at the top.]
;W[hc]
(;B[ec]C[ff - I think that this play is not very good here. The right is wider than the left. This stone is more about protecting territory in the corner than about attacking the invader. White's stone is not easy to attack after this.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[kd]
(;B[lc]C[ff - Is this a mistake in direction? Since this does not protect the upper right corner, the combination of E17 and M17 seem to leave Black in a tough situation. See the variation...]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]
(;B[qe]C[ff - This is a standard joseki, but here it leaves Black overconcentrated and with weaknesses. See the variation...]
;W[re];B[rf];W[pe];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc]C[ff - Of course this is painfully overconcentrated with M17.]
;W[sd]
(;B[ke]LB[pi:A]C[rs: this move I figured to be the game losing mistake, instead I should have played at A. to limit White's overall influence...what do u think?

ff - I think that L15 is no the best locally. But frankly it might be too late to call it the losing move. :-)]
;W[id]
(;B[ld]C[ff - See the variation...]
(;W[oh];B[hf]C[rs: is this the right move to attack White's stones?]
(;W[if]
(;B[ie];W[he];B[je]C[ff - Now White has a pretty easy time of it. The stone on J14 may be cut off but it continues to have important aji.]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[fe]
(;B[eg]C[ff - This looks too loose. See the variation...];W[fc]
;B[jb];W[ib]
(;B[en]C[ff - Classic example of bad timing :)  Black absolutely can not play away from the top!]
;W[cc];B[eb];W[de]C[ff - A nice sequence by White.];B[ce];W[ff]
(;B[fg]C[ff - But Black helps White by following along here. See the variation...]

;W[gg]
(;B[fi]C[ff - It is better to simply take the two White stones...]
;W[ci]
(;B[fk]C[ff - Black has no time for this. See the variation...]

(;B[af]C[ff - When Black lives this way, White can still capture the corner...]
;W[bm];B[bl];W[bk];B[aj];W[ei];B[fj]C[rs: Black looks lost here or would u still see chances?

(;B[df]C[ff - Better to play here I think. Black threatens to build a large territory on the left side.]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[gh];B[fi];W[od];B[oc];W[of]C[ff - However, White has the ability to take compensation on the right since Black played elsewhere in response to P12.]

)))
(;B[je]C[ff - I think this is better. The question is what does Black need in order to be satisfied here? Black already has three corners completely enclosed. Only the upper right is still in question. Meanwhile White has the bottom plus central thickness. If Black erases the center without too much damage, White's prospects become very questionable. In the game, White erases the upper right and still threatens to take the center. K15 is directed against the center and is willing to let White live small at the top. I think this fits better with Black's previous play at E17.]

)
(;W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[cb];W[ed];B[de]C[ff - Even if White pretty much settles things this way, Black takes the corner and still has forcing plays against W. D10 can still be attacked and meanwhile it is now difficult to enter at R17  because Black will get too much by simply answering as in the game.]

;B[kr];W[kq];B[lr];W[jr]C[ff - Usually an important aim of this joseki is to reduce the bottom side. It is most effective when White has made a shimari in the lower left and the bottom is as wide as possible. Here the bottom is not so wide. So White could think that Black can not do so much damage, relatively speaking.]
))
(;B[nq]C[ff - I think it is definitely worth considering the diagonal play. It is an infrequently seen variation in professional play but it has several things in its favor here:
- It does not "force" White to play P7, which leaves more aji in the Q7 stone,
- It eliminates the cut at O4 completely,
- It creates a nice follow up at M2.];W[rq];B[qr];W[qi];B[qg]

(;B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[ro];B[on];W[pm];B[om];W[pl];B[ln]C[ff - Something like this is actually possible, although normally it is considered lacking in resources for Black. In this position, though, if Black simply runs out, what does White have left? Black should be satisfied to limit the value of M4 and D10. If that happens, Black may have better prospects since the top has not been damaged by any of the activity yet.]
