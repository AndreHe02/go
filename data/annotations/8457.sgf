Dieter Verhofstadt (2d)

Hi Joe. Your question is: "How to put my thickness to use?". 

You indeed acquired a tremendous advantage in the beginning. White made a mistake in the corner sequence and you got the corner territory, plus central influence and hence tremendous thickness. This is different from a fair result, where White gets the corner territory and you get an influencial wall. In that case, your question is legitimate: how to "work" with my wall. However, in this game you not only have an influencial wall. You are simply ahead on both territory and thickness. The answer to "what to do when ahead" is: nothing special. Just keep on playing normal moves and your thickness will take care of itself. It is on the contrary White who has to do something special to get back into the game.

It seems though as you were not convinced that just playing normal would be enough and felt compelled to "do" something. In fact, you first played very good, sharp moves, which nicely exposed your advantage in thickness. At some point, you seemed to become exhausted and continued to make the game complex, resulting in a big fight in White's favourable area, eventually leading to a loss. There was indeed a mistake in direction involved. However, I feel it was mostly a consequence of your underestimation of your own advantage.

You can jump directly to move 94, which is the pivotal moment in the game. Until then, I believe your game is very good, as I will regularly point out.]

;B[dj]C[Again I"m lost.  I feel I'm winning the fights but what do I do with this thickness?

dv: You're doing great! You extend your weakest group, building influence, away from your thickness at the bottom right.]
;W[cn];B[hp]C[Splendid! You are using the thickness to invade.]
;W[hq];B[gq];W[iq];B[gp];W[mq];B[kq]C[A sharp move, but White is the one in trouble.]

1. territory
2. influence
3. strength of groups (thickness)

Please do yours now.
I'll give my judgment on the next move.]

C[Black 
- top right: 25 points
- bottom right: 20 points
- 5 prisoners
= 50 points
- influence on the left side
- lots of influence from right to centre
- overall strength, but one weakish group (A)

White
- 7 points on the right
- 6 points at the top
- a potential bottom left corner
- two weakish groups at the top and the bottom, although they influence the centre.

Conclusion:
- Black is way ahead in territory (30+), influence an thickness
- I would increase the overall thickness by expanding my weakest groups
- White's lack of thickness will show when battling out the centre, where Black can expect much more points

Therefore, my next move would be as in the variation];W[jm]
LB[km:A]TR[gp][hp][gq]SQ[ol][om][oo]C[Black's previous move was a mistake in direction: it's too close to the squared thickness and too far from the triangled weakish stones.

White astutely attaches to that stone to build influence towards the weak black group.]
;B[jl];W[im];B[il]C[Probably you are trying a large scale splitting attack. While this is possible, it is also needlessly complex.]
;W[hm]C[From here onward, White is turning the tables. You are pushing him over your weakest stones, while your own attack on his top stones is difficult to engineer with all that space.

There are sure many opportunities to win the ensuing fight, because your thickness still works to your advantage. But it didn't need to become that complex.

This is the end of the commentary. Feel free to come back with more questions or if you disagree with any of the analysis.

Enjoy your games!
