C[Hello, I´m Juan (Blacks). After this game Julieta told me she has played in a too risky way, I think she was right. I was more cautious, but also had some life and death mistakes]
;B[pq];W[pd];B[dp];W[dd];B[cm]C[Not a bad move but a bit odd and slow, around K4 i far more common but D or Q 10 is also playble. R5 or 6 are also nice.]
;W[jd]C[She seems to be cautious, but then...

Ah, the sanrensai opening. Actually this is an opening that is used for fighting, not to take territory. 
White is saying to invade or lose... ;-)
But the truce is if W get to play all D,K,Q 10 it's gameover for black.
And in my games my opponents are generally scared of the sanrensai that your C7 played at C14, F17, O17 or R14. Sometimes K16 just to prevent from getting the sanrensai...
If you really wanna know how devestaing the sanrensai can be, read "Power of the Starpoint".
If you learn it by hart your opponents will tremble in fear... ;-)
Well almost anyway.];B[pj];W[dj];B[jq]C[Would you play C7 now?
Or does K10 seem more intresting.]
(;W[qp]C[This is a warrior´s move, isn´t it?

The ide is right but i think R7 would be better then W could extend in either way(R10 or R4).  R10 ends up with a crosscut and sh**loads of other complications if one isn't carefull. But there's a golden rule to crosscuts, extend away from your strength. It's not alway correct but most of the times.

To know more about crosscuts read "crosscut workshop". But be aware it's a somewhat confusing book. 

Though the whole consept of crosscuts is to complicate things and confuse your opponent if you ask me :)]
;B[qq]C[It helped me to get stronger there];W[pp];B[op];W[oo]
;B[pm];W[po]C[W could protect at Q6 or S4. But i think O4 then Q6, and not to answer the atari at P4 would be foolish, this early in the game.]
;B[np];W[no]
(;B[qg]C[On the other hand, the Q4 goup has also became stronger

Black at S6 would takeaway most of the base W´s Q4 group.
R14 aims mor for the corner then R13 but B gets weak or rather gets weakness at R12. B can live with this because of the 3-3 invasion work extra well for B to get territory but W gets an wall that makes the area (Q16-K16) wery easy make territory for W.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[ro];B[rd];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[md];W[me];B[ne]

Be carefull they have a tendency to backfire.];W[nd];B[od];W[nc]

Group? If your thinking of C7 and D4 as a group your out on thin ice...
What will B do if W plays D3 or W at B5 followed by C3 or more important what will be left for B?

I would think of the two stones as "A future group" or a "group to be" but they are not yet a group.]

;B[bd];W[bc];B[bf];W[bm];B[fi]C[I was securing the center

Why? 1 in a 100 games gives me territory in the center. B3 or B6 is better. And if W plays F9 how secure is your center...]
;W[bn]C[C18 is way bigger for W];B[cb];W[eb];B[bb]C[90 at c3 would have been a worst problem? However, I lost a big amount of territory there afterwards

C3 not bad B. use the wall and get alot of territory.
W ends up with a few points in the corner B get the edge and maybe a huge extension into the center, and just to make thing a little bit better for Black white's R4 group is really in bad danger especially if B play moves like R5 and then if possible T3.

If W wanna attack he should play something like D3, F3, G3 even H3 with a followup at M3 would work]

;W[ql]C[Uh, this made me get very scared!
It should.. I don't think W has any ide how devistaing it is.]

(;B[qm]C[Argh, learn this NOW!!!
If your about to play an empty triangle(R7 makes Q6-7 into one) THINK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!!! Until you find a better move. Even PASS is a better move.
What B should play here is Q8.

Though as always in GO there are exceptions and those are .
you can make an empty triangle as a atarimove, to live with a group, to kill group. Other than that, no it cant be any other kind of exceptions.


You may laugh a little about my attitude towards empty triangels but really they are that bad.
Even the L8 that W makes laterin this game is more efficient the this R7.]

(;W[pl]C[Lucky :)
W at S7 and the whole edge is gone like *POFF*];B[rm];W[rl]

Aint that the truth.  :D
And if you havn't figured it out yet, it probably never gonna work. But if you don't try you won't know if it could work...]
;W[il];B[mm];W[mn]C[This is the time when I think she was too hurried to make two eyes

W at T4 = Alive

think O6 is better because even if B cuts at N4 W can still towards that group in hope of rescue and at the sametime destroy what little territory B could get there.
W should NOT try to run with that group because if W fails to save it the cost is tremendous. Now it's just 4 points that needs 2-3 black moves to be killed]

(;W[oq]C[Another battle begins!

If W play T3 B would be in great danger, only problem is it the kind of danger that's easily missed.

The book "In the beginning" it's explained why the 2 by 2* wall is not so good. By the way if you gonna read only one book "In the beginning" is the one i recomend.

Your idea is about as correct as it can be.
D6 is a telltell sign of ineffective moves and you wanna have effective moves right. The most common result for a fat group in my games is that it's dead before it can be saved and when it's saved it has usually costed both sente and 1 or even 2 big endgame moves...]
