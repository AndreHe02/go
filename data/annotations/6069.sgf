C[I'm white

G: My coments will start with this G. I hope it'll be useful.]
;B[pc]C[B begins with 3-4 point];W[dp]C[I begin with 4-4 point

Generally, with black I like also to begin with 3-4 point at two corners and then do shimari. However, with white I am behind a move so it is not so easy to do shimari. Therefore I usually play 4-4 points with white.
Does it make sense?

G: sure, no problem. but you have to be aware that the Hoshi (4-4 point) is made for influence, therefore combat.]

(;B[oq]C[Black is doing shimari (what I would usually do when playing B, but now I'm W)

Question: is there any preference where to do the shimari first? I mean consider P3   and  R15, which is better for B?

G: I prefer this one, the other one would be facing the white hoshi.]

(;W[qj]LB[pf:a][dj:b]C[I considered playing R15 instead of R10. Which is better?

G: Very difficult question, play whichever you feel good with. I think A could also be good.
you could also consider the san-ren-sei at B.];B[ql];W[qg]LB[pf:a]
;B[qe];W[jc]LB[oj:a][ol:b]C[G: I' rather play at A to secure your weak group a bit more. As a bonus, it looks towards the direction of B, reducing black's territory/moyo]
;B[lc];W[gc]LB[dd:a][je:b]C[G: too flat to work with the Hoshi at A, it is submissive. Better play at B, expanding your moyo and looking to reduce black"s]

(;W[eq]LB[en:a]C[Maybe K4 instead?

G: this move is too submissive. If you're going to play from this corner group, better to get out and threaten the lack group on the left. For example playing at A.
K4 doesn't look good, see var.];B[kq]C[This got me in difficulties]

(;W[mp]C[G: wrong direction. You're helping black separate two of your groups. See variation]

G: me neither.]
(;W[hm]C[Maybe D7 instead of H7?

G: yes, would be better. This defensive move is not needed for the moment, so keep black separated.]
;B[dm]
(;W[cg]LB[ce:a][ch:b]C[Maybe C15 better?

G: The problem I see with this move is: you want it to have dual purpose, but you acieve neither. To close the corner, play A. To put pressure on the black group, play at B.]

(;B[bd]C[G: see variation for proper sequence];W[be];B[bc]C[G: mistake by black, see joseki two moves before]

LB[qn:a][bo:b][fl:c][nc:d]C[G: I don't really like the sequence starting with this. The whole sequence is worth at most 10 points, and is destructing aji. Better not to play at all there until there is something more interesting to do (maybe invade at A).
B seems big to me, or C (defending your weak group), or D. difficult to say for me.]

right?

G: Well, I think this is better. See why in the variations.]

G: not sure, see variation for example, with white playing at A]

(;W[ik]C[G: see var];B[jh];W[ki];B[kh];W[ih]TB[lq][mp][mq]C[pointless move
so I should have played something else
like L10

Rest of the game, I don't think there was much to do for me, B has already last advantage

G: black as a big advantage now. However there are a few comments to be made, so please read on.]

[lj:c]C[G: purpose of this move? What happens if black plays at A now? see variation.
Big problem is that the black cutting stones AB are safe because C is in atari]
