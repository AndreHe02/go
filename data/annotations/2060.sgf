C[Some general comments:

1) I seems you worry too much. Don't. You were doing OK for most of this game, but that is not the impression one gets from your comments. And look for ways to make your opponent worry.

2) Do you know how to count? You could have made your life a bit simpler at times by estimating the score before making a decision. The basic technique is covered in chapter 1 of "The Endgame" from the Elementary Go Series, and the ideas are taken further in "Positional Judgement" by Cho Ckikun. And of course, you need to pratice a lot so that you gain speed and confidence and accuracy. Ideally, you should be able to count all the territory of one colour in one minute, then you can do it when your opponent is thinking about their move. Counting is the way to win won games, and there was a moment when you had this game won.

3) Don't let your opponent capture the cutting stones (O.K. I think you know this really ;-). And more generally, try to prevent his weak groups from connecting. This is part of making him worry, not you.

4) You are right, your sabaki is not so good. You have to be prepared to let some of your stones be captured. It is quite hard to learn. One way is to play against stronger players in handicap games, and watch them survive all over the areas where you are strong. The other way is to play through professional games looking for examples. For example is 1971 Honinbo title match, game 2, the sequence starting from Black 89. This is probably my favorite sequence from any game ever. I expect you can get it from gobase.org.]

;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[mq];B[po]TR[kq]C[turvoy: My idea was to keep a possible invasion at delta.

Yes. Once you have played on the 3-4 point, you want to make a shimari next. Your opponent has just given you the perfect excuse to do so, so you should leap at the chance.

The only question is, who is going to play next on the right side? If black plays next, around Q10, then you are happy for this move to be on the 4th line. If white plays next at R5, you may wish that you had played on the third line. However, it is not clear, and as you say, you want to aim at the invasion.]
;W[qm]LB[qj:D][mo:A][no:B][kq:C]C[turvoy: This move was embarrassing, maybe a simple separation at A or B would be better
than invasion at C.

No, it is not terribly embarrassing. White is a bit thin at the bottom, and this white stone should become a weak group. Your corner is strong, so white may have bitten off more than he can handle.

I think that you really must pincer around D (see variation). A pincer is also a good extension from the top right corner.]

(;B[kq]C[This does seem to be too much, but only be a little bit, because white will have weak groups too.

The real point is that there is no need to rush in like this and make things difficult. It is OK to let white have a bit of territory at the bottom, it is not so big, and there are other, bigger and simpler moves available.]
;W[mo];B[ko];W[mm]
(;B[km]C[It is really bad to let white connect his two weak groups together, and it is also bad to let your corner get shut in.]
;W[on];B[rn]TR[fo]C[turvoy: I not proud of this sequence.
 But still a weakness remain at delta so  this is not so horrible for me.

This is a horrible move. The second line is the line of defeat. Do you really have to play here?

First, can white really kill you with one more move? It is difficult, and not obvious, so you could risk it.   Second, even if he does kill you with one more, he has made 40 point of territory in this corner, with 6 moves - that is not enough to cause you to resign. And, once you have a dead group, you have lots of ko threats.

Third, the marked point is excellent, so you could play there immediately. You are threatening to make 60 points on the left, so forget about the right for now.

Fourth, your black group in the corner is shut in, so whether it lives of dies is just an endgame move (OK so it is a big endgame move). The stuff on the right is is all connected out into the centre, so what happens here will affect the whole board.]
;W[rm];B[qn]C[Now you really should ignore white. I don't believe you can be killed if you tenuki instead of this move.]
;W[pm];B[qg]C[So you get away with sente anyway. After your move at S6, that should never have happened. I think that white S7 is wrong.

This move is certainly a good one. So is F5. My feeling is that you made the right choice, especially with the white stones at S7 and Q7.]
;W[qi]C[This white move is quite small. The white group is plenty strong enough anyway, especially with with the 3 black stones next to it being so weak.]

(;B[cm]TR[fo]C[turvoy: probably too slow.
 delta was better.

Yes. A move at delta attacks white, and in the process defends the black stones in the middle of the bottom side.

(But well done for knowing this move, which is often the correct shape move locally.)

Actually, delta may not be exactly the right point.];W[fp]C[Of course, you may still be able to start something with a move like G4, but one of your opportunities seems to have gone.]
;B[fc]C[But of course, you have sente for this good move.];W[id]
C[A pincer seems like the natural move for white.];B[fe]C[I think this is a good choice of Joseki.]
;W[df]C[Since black is strong in the bottom left corner, I would play this move on the third line.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[ib]C[This is a good moment to take stock of the situation. Roughly speaking it looks like black has four 10 to 15 point groups, and white has three.   Of course, white has the next move, and black has the weak group at the bottom, so the game is still interesting, but there is no reason for you to be unhappy.]
;W[nc]C[Especially since white needs to stop you making a nice moyo at the top.]
;B[pc]TR[ib]C[This is quite right.   Your marked stone makes it difficult for white to make his group safe at the top, so you can afford to take territory, and sit back and watch to see how he manages.]
;W[gd];B[fd]
(;W[jb]C[This is a standard  sequence for white. There are some problems about it in Get Strong at Joseki Vol. 3 (the last few). There is no need for black to worry, however, because the black group is perfectly alive, it is just that white is entitled to these forcing moves.

Actually, the book suggest the variation instead for white, which lets him avoids the complications of the game.]
;B[ic]C[Good.];W[jc];B[jd];W[hd];B[gc];W[lc]
(;B[cb]TR[jd]C[turvoy: yet another bad move.
 I should have protected the delta stone !

Yes. Your variation is correct.];W[je]LB[ce:E][qe:H][og:C][ch:B]
[fn:A][hn:D][gp:F][fr:G]TR[fp]C[turvoy: It is hard for to find a good move now.
 I have different plans:

Not really. I still think that black has a bit more territory.

turvoy: The idea of A is to build a moyo or launch a violent fight.
D let white make too much territory.
Because of the delta stone the fight seems dangerous for black.

Tim: I don't really like A or D, they seem too vague. Locally I prefer a play like F or G to stir things up locally. White has to worry about his whole group becoming weak. He will have to scrabble around and try to capture some black stones, but in the process, Black should aim to get some ataris on the outside and end up with a stronger position than just playing A straight away. However, it gets messy, and I can't read out all of the possibilities. This is an option, but there is no need to play this way.

turvoy: C is too greedy.

Tim: I don't understand why you say C is greedy. I think that C is a slow defensive move. The question is, are you scared about a white invasion at H? If you are, then C is a good defensive move, but then if white plays C11, do you have enough territory to win the game? If you think that a white invasion at H does not work, then playing at C is definitely too small.

turvoy: B is probably simpler.

Tim: B is my favorite move. It seems quite simple, expand your territory while making white worry in the top left corner.

turvoy: E is the worst move :(

Tim: It's not that bad, it is just the way you follow it up. After Black E, white connects, you can still play B, which is good.]

(;B[ce]C[I chose E :(];W[de];B[bc]LB[ch:B]C[So as I said, this would be better at B]
;W[cf];B[bd]LB[ch:B]C[You can still play a pincer move around B, (but probably a bit further away now). If white captures the one black stone that is small, and not necessarily two eyes.]
;W[dj];B[em];W[jq]
(;B[kr]C[What about the hane at K2?];W[oq];B[pr];W[kp];B[lp]
;W[jp]
(;B[lq]LB[lo:A]C[turvoy: Maybe connect at A is better ?

Sorry, I'm not sure.];W[lo];B[mp];W[np];B[mr];W[oh]C[turvoy: A big point for white !]

(;B[qh];W[pi];B[jr];W[hq];B[nq];W[hm]C[O.K. so suddenly a big white centre has appeared. Who wins the game is going to depend on how much territory White makes there. This is a really good moment to count the game.

Black:

Top left: 15 points.
Top Right: 15 points.
Bottom left: 15 points.
Bottom right: 20 points.

Total: 65 points.

White:

Bottom edge: 10 points.
Right edge: 15 points.
Top edge: 15 points.

Total: 40 points.

So white needs more than 25 in the middle to win.

At first, that does not look too difficult. Then you notice, does a move like F10 make white worry on the left edge? does a move around N14 threaten to escape with the cutting stone? So perhaps you still have a chance.]
;B[kj];W[kk]C[This is not so good. I would play H10 and try to capture all the black stones!]
;B[jk];W[jl];B[il];W[jm]
(;B[ji]C[turvoy: "sabaki like" moves but not real sabaki :(

Up to this point it was OK, this last move is too heavy. I think I would play straight at F10.]

(;W[ik];B[hk]C[Good sabaki. White was kind.];W[jj];B[ij];W[jk]

Yes. How did you manage that!

Bottom right: 13
Bottom: 2
Bottom left: 15
Top left: 15
Top right: 15
Middle: 20

Total: 80.

Yes, but your group at the bottom is alive even if you don't connect the ko!]

(;B[pf]C[turvoy: This greedy move is typical of my suicidal style :(

Quite. You were about 25 points ahead, and you have just gained 5-10 more when you play P2 or P4. You can probably give up the two stones at R12 and R13, live in the corner, and still win. Count!]
