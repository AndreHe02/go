;B[ci]C[ajax: I do not know what is the best play here.

reid:  I haven't made any comments up till now because black is *so* far ahead, I don't see how white can win.  Not to say black's play has been perfect (hey, we're amateurs, after all), but white's best strategy at this point is to resign and try again.

Lets's look at the score:  black's upper right is about the same size as white's lower left.  Both corners have some painful aji left, so let's consider them about equal.

White's other territory is about 6 points on the right side, another 6 around N4, maybe 10 around C12 and the strength at D16 (even less after black plays C11.  There's no way that can compete with black's upper left corner (10), lower right (15), bottom center (10) plus center strength.  Black is at maybe 15 points ahead.on the board, and his central influence is far superior.

So now let's look at how things continue...];W[cl]C[reid: this is natural - it would be a good point for black too, but C11 is not bad either.]
;B[bh]LB[dh:A]C[reid: but this is the wrong direction.  Black has been building center strength very nicely, but this move, and the following few, encourage white to get strong in the center.

Just look how nicely black A would continue to develop the center and at the same time reduce white's strong D16 position.

Of course, black won't get all, or even much of the center, but since he's already ahead in territory, he just needs to keep white busy until the game is over.]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[df];B[bf];W[eh];B[gc]LB[fb:B][ge:A][nh:D][ck:C]
[cq:E][pr:F]C[reid: I don't understand why black needs this move now?  It's the common response to white A (because A threatens the white G17, black B continuation), but I don't see much need for it.  Any of the other marked points (C-F) would be better now.]
;W[cj];B[di];W[bj];B[bi];W[fg];B[gi]C[reid: this an overplay.  Black doesn't need to take this kind of risk.]
;W[fj];B[dj];W[fi];B[ae];W[mh];B[kh];W[od]C[reid: white doesn't need this move - it's aji-keshi.  Better to leave it for now.]
;B[pc];W[lh];B[kg];W[lg];B[gh]C[reid: Hmmm, it looks like black is trying to make territory in the center - that's not easy considering that white and black have about equal strengths in this area.]
;W[gg];B[qk];W[rl];B[kf];W[lf];B[lj]LB[kj:A]C[reid: this is asking for trouble.  Black is trying to connect the three L11 stones and take territory around N9 with one move.  The problem with this idea is that black can't get any territory at N9 as long as the three L12 stones are vulnerable.

Jumping to A would be safer.];W[ki]C[reid: black should expect this after M10.]
;B[li];W[ji]C[ajax: I am confronting a difficult fight here. How did I get into such a trouble. What should I have did to avoid it?

reid: M10 was the dangerous move.];B[ih];W[jh];B[hg];W[jg];B[hf]
;W[ie];B[gf];W[ff];B[fh];W[dh];B[gj]LB[ee:F][fe:D][ef:E][dg:C]
[eg:B][ei:A]C[reid: the last three moves have all been a bit strange.  Let's look at them in reverse:  Black can cut at A now instead of G10.  White must respond because the black B through F sequence leaves white with only one eye.

Which means that white should connect at A instead of D12 the previous move.  If white *had* played A, then F12 is kind of meaningless - it just removes a liberty for the black group.]
;W[ei];B[jk];W[fo];B[er]LB[of:C][cq:A][dr:B]C[reid: Later, black tries to invade at A, but the invasion fails because black already exchanged E2 for B.

If black is going to fix white's aji in this corner, he should make sure he gets sente to clean up his own upper-right corner aji.

Perhaps it would be better to simply fix the upper right aji and let white worry about black A.  Black C looks like a nice sente-ish way to fix the aji.]
;W[dr];B[fr];W[qe];B[qf]LB[pe:A][re:B]C[reid: I think A would be better than R14.  If white plays atari with R14, black can play B, so white will probably play B instead.]
;W[pe]LB[rc:C][re:A][sf:B]C[reid: A would be more severe.  There is still miai for connection at B or Q15, and white C is threat.]
;B[of]LB[rd:A]C[ajax: I made a blunder here.

reid: Yes, perhaps A would be better.];W[re];B[rc];W[nf];B[se]
LB[sf:A][pg:B]C[reid: this move loses points for black.  If black wants to keep white split, he should just descend to A (B and T15 are still miai).]
;W[sd];B[sf];W[rd];B[ng];W[oe];B[qb];W[oh];B[pg]C[reid: it would be better to play here directly instead of sacrificing O13.  O13 is a 'false' tesuji.]
;W[oi];B[cr]LB[ib:C][pr:B][ds:A]C[reid:  This looks like black is suddenly desperate.  But in fact, if he simply hanes at A, secures the lower right corner in sente with B and finally takes the big yose at C, black still has a good chance in this game.]
;W[ds];B[cq];W[dq];B[bo];W[cp];B[bp];W[br]C[reid: after this invasion fails, white's corner is 22 points (as opposed to 18 if black takes D1 in sente), and black loses about a point from the H3 area.

Let's assume the same sequence I mentioned in move 155.  White has 20 more points in the center, four points on the right, ten in the bottom right, and three in the F13 group.  Total: 59 points.

Black has 18 points in the upper left, 15 in the lower right, 10 on the bottom, and 6 in the upper right.  Total: 49.  Black needs 10 points plus komi for a total of 18 points in the center.  Probably not gonna happen, so resignation is reasonable.

Black had an excellent start in this game.  His loss was ultimately due to a whole bunch of minor endgame losses.  The three L13 stones was the first problem, followed by the bad trade of settling white's aji in the lower left while letting white into the upper right corner.

It looks like black should concentrate on fighting technique.  The absolute best way to get better at fighting is to study life-and-death.  Get a few good books (Maeda, or Jujo and Ming-Jiu's book for example).  I find that doing three problems every day works nicely - perhaps before going to sleep.  A few weeks of this and you'll start seeing the game differently!

If you can get your fighting ability up to your fuseki, 5-dan should be easy.]
