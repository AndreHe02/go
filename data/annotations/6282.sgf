;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[nc];B[pf];W[gc]C[AM: White is low here.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb]C[CG: This move should be at B18.];B[ci]
;W[ck]LB[jp:B][fq:A]C[AM: Ok. I do not think I made any big mistake. I think I have a little advantage here. I think white move is a mistake because it's not really an extension from white corner. White is very weak here.

CG: I would not say Wc9 is a mistake. It is a checking extension and creates some aji at C13. It also avoids B c6, which  would be a big move for black.]
;B[fq];W[cn]LB[ip:A][jp:B]C[AM: I wonder if white around A or B won't have been better. White is a bit over concentrated I think.

CG: No, I would also prefer playing C6 or D6.

AM: What must I play now ? A or B ?

CG: The choice between A and B is more or less a matter of taste. I usually play B.]

(;B[ip]LB[jp:B][hq:A]C[AM: I do not want to play B because A is a weak point and I can no more invade in san-san.

CG: You could still invade the corner (see variation).];W[nq]
LB[pn:B][lq:A][oq:C]TR[ip]SQ[pf]C[AM: Here, I really don't know how to deal with white stone.
My triangle stone is a bit far for an attack with C.
I do not like B because I fear white extension on L3 which would weaken my 2 black stones.
A is an extension while attacking. So I choose it.

CG: In professional games, the most common move is C. 
The drawback of A is that the square stone becomes inefficient after white enters the corner.]
;B[lq]
(;W[no]C[CG: Running away is not good as white cannot play a counter pincer. White should rather take the corner.]
;B[pn];W[lp];B[kq];W[qh]C[CG: This is an overplay. White should settle his stones first.]
;B[qk]C[AM: Is it ok ?
I do not like the sequence following...

CG: This is ok. However, you should be careful to get sente at the top to attack the white stones at the bottom.]
;W[rf]LB[rd:A]C[AM: I played A, which is certainly a mistake. See variation.

CG: R15 would have been much better as it does not allow white to settle his group.
 Personally, I would have played P3. Neither side can get a decisive advantage at the top with just one additional move, so this area is not as "hot" as the bottom.]

(;B[rd]TR[pd][pf]C[AM: I know it's not a very good shape. Maybe my first big mistake.]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[pb]
(;B[qg]C[CG: Ouch. This is an aji-keshi, just playing Q12 is better. If white hanes at Q11, you can still play R13 (in that case, it is "justified" by cutting of a stone).]
;W[rg];B[ph];W[qf];B[pg];W[qe]
(;B[pe]C[AM: maybe R16 was better. I'm building some thickness, but I'm not sure I could use it.

CG: I think Q17 is the correct move here. If white pushes through at Q15, you get the corner.]
;W[qd]
(;B[qc];W[pc]
(;B[rc]C[CG: This is mochikomi (adding a prisoner in gote), i.e. minus one move in gote - worse than passing!
This is easily worth your losing margin!!

If you want to connect because you want to leave some aji and you think white has to finally capture the stones (semedori), you must still atari at R11 first! Letting white play R11 in exchange for S17 is UNBEARABLE!!!]
;W[qi];B[pi];W[rb];B[nm]C[CG: Good!];W[lo]
(;B[me]LB[ne:A]C[AM: I would like white to play A.

CG: You should play (at least) M7 first. White has to move out his group, and letting him doing this while reducing your moyo is not good.]
;W[lm];B[lc]C[CG: Wrong direction. Play away from thickness!!
White is strong on both sides, so you cannot gain much at the top. This is the reason M7 was so important - you should use your thickness for attacking, and this has become difficult now.]

(;W[lb]C[CG: This is actually an "underplay" as there is no immeadiate threat in the corner.]
;B[lk];W[jn];B[mn];W[ln];B[jl];W[hn];B[id];W[kc];B[kd];W[ld]
C[CG: This is again a bad move by white - just extending to K17 is better.]
;B[le];W[mc]LB[ei:B][hl:C][dr:D][pr:A]C[AM: Ok. I think I'm still ahead.
What are big points now ?

CG: This depends on how much territory you get from your moyo. Being a territory-oriented player, I would prefer white.

AM: 
A takes corner.
B protect against an invasion
C extend black moyo
D is big and sente.

I think I should play D (sente) and C

CG: D is not sente since white has already the extension to C9! If black plays D, white should take another big point like K16 or G8.]

(;B[jc]C[AM: But I choose that awfull move  :-(

CG: Well, it is also a big point.];W[ge]
(;B[fd]LB[ke:A]C[CG: What is the meaning of this peep? It only makes the cutting point at A bigger!
Whithout this peep, you don't have to connect at A, so just take one of the big points like C3 or D2.]
;W[gd];B[ke]C[AM: I gained nothink except reinforcing white and losing sente.

CG: Yes, but the reason was F16, not K17.];W[fe]
(;B[ei]C[AM: Missing d2 again.

CG: Yes, but I think you were afraid of C13.
I'm not sure if it works immediately, but the variations are dangerous. If you think you are ahead, E11 is a good move.]
;W[cg]C[CG: Entering here after you added another move looks desparate. I think white should just calmly play one of the big endgame moves.]

(;B[dg];W[dh];B[ch];W[df]
(;B[cf]TR[ei]C[CG: This is a slack move, making the triangle stone a bad move.]
;W[eg];B[bg];W[eq];B[fp];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr]
(;B[qp]C[CG: This is a difficult decision. It might be better to block at P2 and try to attack the white group. This is of course risky, but it might be your last chance to win the game.]
;W[qr];B[mq];W[nr]C[Ok, I think white is well ahead now.];B[ef]
;W[fg];B[mp];W[mo];B[np];W[il];B[ik];W[hl];B[dg];W[hg]C[CG: White is clearly ahead now.]
