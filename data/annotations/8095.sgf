C[vandrei [9k\]: hi
simon [9k\]: hi
vandrei [9k\]: have fun
simon [9k\]: gg
vandrei [9k\]: FINALY A BALANCED GAME
vandrei [9k\]: THX GOD
simon [9k\]: what did you get in your last game
simon [9k\]: ?
vandrei [9k\]: first round i played i was with a 5k but he forfeits
vandrei [9k\]: and the other two games i played i played with dan's]
;B[qd]C[Did I play ok in the opening?

BW: Hi simon.  I'm happy to review your game.  I'll prefix my notes through the game with BW (BruceWayne, KGS) and then summarize at the end.]
;W[cp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[qo];B[qk]TR[pm][qm]C[BW: since you are extending from a strong upper right, I would play more aggressively at one of the marked points.]

C[Was this a even secuence?

BW: this sequence was very bad for B.  You got about 10 pts in the corner but it is bad to be shut in like this so early in the game.  W on the other hand is very strong and has a lot of influence.  See the variation.]
;B[fc];W[cf]
(;B[jc]LB[id:A][jd:B]TR[fc][oc][qd][qk]C[BW:  too low!  all of the marked stones are on the 3rd line!  between these moves and the lower right, you seem to be obsessed with territory.  a play at A or B makes a much better framework on the top.]

(;B[co];W[do];B[cn];W[em];B[mn]TR[jl][jm][km][in][jn][kn]C[Is this a good move? If not would have been?

BW:  I see you are trying to reduce and aim at the cutting point in W's wall, but this feels a bit close.  I would try something around the marked pts because they are further away from W's thickness.]
;W[pk]C[BW: W begins a leaning attack on your N6 stone....]

vandrei [9k\]: LOL
vandrei [9k\]: the game is over
vandrei [9k\]: thx
simon [9k\]: ty
vandrei [9k\]: have luck in tourney
simon [9k\]: you too

BW: Well, there wasn't too much to review here.  Obviously, you should work on reading and life & death.  That helps everyone in every aspect of the game.  Specifically, be weary of always playing on the 3rd line and going for territory.  Try playing a few games where you only go for influence, just to see how it "feels".  Then you can balance out the two.]
