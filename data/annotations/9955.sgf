C[Hello,

This was a game played for PGETC season 2015-2016, Group C, Croatia vs South Africa.
The time was 1 hour per player + 25/10 byoyomi.
I played black against Chris Welsh (sente) 2D.

This is one of those games that I think is good for review, because for the most part, I thought I was doing well - and then realized that things have gone bad without really understanding where and why exactly. Maybe they were never so good to begin with, but I really feel I played the second half of the game badly and lost bits and pieces everywhere, which resulted in a loss.

Thank you for taking the time to review!

Cheers,
Daniel Zrno];B[pd];W[dq];B[cd];W[qo];B[do];W[cm];B[cq];W[gq]
;B[dp];W[dr];B[bo];W[cj];B[cr];W[jq];B[ch]C[DZ: Pretty normal so far, but at this move I wondered if finishing up the chinese (J17) or approaching the white corner (P3 or Q3) would've been better.
Still, both are gote and I didn't like W having an easy time approaching my C16 stone. This way puts more pressure on his group so I chose that.

janr: the game move looks good, it attacks a group, we say urgent moves before big moves so it is sente.after White replies you can still play the big points you mentioned.]
;W[em];B[gp]LB[id:C][ch:A][pj:E][em:B][fn:D]C[DZ: not to get enclosed, I needed a way to split white and preferably in sente. This seems to work?

janr: here, it seems to early.  
You exchanges A for B, perfect.
Now it's time to play elsewhere and keep sente.
Black in the corner is 100% alive.
I white wants to spend a move to connect his already more or less stable group to another more or less stable group, he can do so but that is not very big.
Yes, white would make some center influence in the mean time, but imagine the sequence black C, white D, black E.
I think black would develop faster.];W[hq];B[dl];W[dm]LB[gp:A]
[fq:B][hq:C]C[ok,white replies to all moves, so black a
Still, these moves were not very urgent.
Especially for A, I could imagine that maybe later in the game you would have liked it to be at B.or C]
;B[pq]C[DZ: I felt it's too early for any serious attack on W left group (I don't see any good white follow-ups at this stage anyway), and that this was a more urgent area.

janr: a few moves ago, you wanted to play A or B to make a moyo.
Now you  play in the corner letting white make influence (and making a black moyo strategy difficult).
Personally, I think your first idea to play on the top side was better]
;W[nq];B[po];W[qp]C[DZ: First time I saw this move. I tried to find a good response but was not really happy with any variation.
Taking the corner seems suboptimal, and anything else lets W get the corner with nothing much for B on the outside (with K3 being positioned so well).

Any ideas?

janr: taking the corner is not a bad idea.  You may live in sente and be able to play a big move (see variation).
Connecting may work but looks heavy to me.]
(;B[pp];W[qq];B[qn]LB[pn:A][np:B]C[White's cut at A is hard.
Maybe black should first get stronger, e.g. by attaching at B.]
;W[pn];B[qr];W[rr];B[qm]C[DZ: I did not like to give W this point combined with the seemingly bad aji of my stones even if I handle them now (like saving R2), so I thought a reversal will work better with my Q16 stone.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qs];B[on];W[oq];B[pk]C[DZ: This feels like I let W take too much (including sente), with the only redeeming quality being that it works well with Q16?

janr: the result doesn't seem terrible, but indeed just playinh Q9 instead of the complete sequence starting with Q3 would give white less definite territory.]
;W[fc];B[dc];W[ic];B[mc]LB[fc:A][ic:B][kc:C]C[DZ: Expanding the moyo while keeping W with two potentially weak groups on the board. I thought the game was ok at this point, despite still feeling I took a local loss in the bottom right corner.
Virtually all the W stones are on the 3rd line, and I feel B potential is better.

janr: if you want to keep  A and B under pressure, it is better to play C.Now, these stones are not (yet) weak.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[rc]C[DZ: I wanted to push W more towards N17, expecting that any plays around that stone will weaken the F17-J17 stones.

Looking back, maybe a simple P17 would've been better, or even P16 (in which case B should take sente I think?)]
;W[oc];B[od];W[rb];B[rd];W[nc];B[md]LB[sb:B][nd:A][oi:C]C[DZ: I thought that if W pushes and cuts, the fight will surely benefit B (B could solidify the territory on the right side, and W has a weak group on the left that will be a liability).
Looking back, again maybe keeping thing simple with O16 would've been better.

janr: the territory on the right is indeed black's largest potential.
Maybe white will just live and keep the gap at A as remaining aji to ensure black can solidify the right less easily?
Imagine white B (to live), black C, white A., black's two stones should run.  I would prefer black at A.]
;W[nd]LB[sb:A]C[janr: this white loses liberties and leaves black's sente at A.]
;B[ne];W[mb];B[lb];W[ma];B[kc]LB[ic:A]C[Black gets strong, white A gets weak.]
;W[me];B[ke]LB[kd:A][nf:B]C[B: Looking back, maybe this stone should've been placed at L16?
I underestimated the M16-K16 weakness.

janr: A and B are the key points for shape indeed.];W[nf];B[oe]
;W[mf];B[sb];W[ra]
(;B[kg]LB[ic:C][mf:B][pg:A]C[janr: I don't agree here.
Your plan was to make territory on the right, not to chase white into the right t make eyes.  
Playing A would keep white weak, force white to run to the center, make territory on the right and induce black to escape between B and C.  As a result, also C would get weak. (see variation)]
;W[nh];B[ph];W[pi];B[qh];W[fe];B[ie]C[B: I realized here just how bad this B groups shape is and attempted to fix it.]
;W[mj];B[oi];W[cf]LB[gd:A]C[B: This was painful, and I just entered byoyomi.
I thought about cutting in some way, but thought that then:
a) W gets territory on the left side
b) B gets another floating group in the center that will be hard to manage due to an already existing weak group
c) didn't see a way B could seriously threaten the top W group, considering these weaknesses

janr:
Maybe first ask the opponent about his plans (i.e. play A) ?
This will help in deciding yourself I think.]
(;B[df];W[de];B[ce];W[dg];B[bf]C[B: So in the end I chose to connect underneath, but this made W stronger and the central B group really weak now.
This looks like a really bad result, considering the situation some 10-20 moves ago. Any ideas how it could've been handled better?

janr: a ponnuki is worth 30 points.];W[ef];B[kj];W[ml];B[bg]
C[B: maybe too small and not urgent? (I was aiming to keep C7 group separated and relatively weak, to help the center.

Also, all this time I am eyeing N3 or close, to break apart the lower side while W N10 group is still weak, but now it felt like it could really endanger my central group too.
Still, looking back, maybe this was the time to do it? B center has quite some room to make eyes still.

janr: n3 is nice shape but not very big/urgent compared to the ongoing fight
Why not C13 rather than B13?  it removes a white eye.];W[di]
;B[dh];W[eh];B[ei]C[B: This was an overplay due to byoyomi. W could've done the F11 atari and capture the cutting stone (I misread that there was danger for C10 if white does, but now I think there isn't).

Still, W apparently agreed with me.

janr: both white groups seem more or less alive by now, cutting is not very interesting.]
;W[fh]LB[ej:A]C[White A is the key point.  After black answers, white can still play the game move.]
;B[ej];W[ck];B[gj];W[hh];B[ii];W[mn]C[B: now it's too late for any invasion around M3?

janr: it is too late to kill white.
Maybe you can still reduce around m3/m4/L4 but how many points would that earn?  There may be larger endgame plays.]
;B[gm]C[B: aiming to make center solid while threatening W left.
According to my counting, I was still ahead in points at this time, so I thought if I just play it safe the game should be ok.]
;W[fn];B[fq];W[fr];B[ho]C[B: probably overplay?];W[gn];B[hn]
;W[hm];B[gl];W[eq];B[fp];W[fk]
(;B[ek]C[B: probably a mistake

janr: the variation offers more resistance.
You can give a few stones on the left if you get something in return elsewhere.]

Due to byoyomi though, the endgame moves are questionable...

[hm][an][jn][pn][ao][io][ap][bp][aq][ar][br][as]C[B: In the end, I think the game was still quite even until the endgame, but then due to several blunders the B center melted away. This part is partially due to byoyomi, so maybe not so interesting for commenting.

Additionally, W got a lot of points around G14 (which was originally a weak target group).
It seems the problems for B started much earlier, with handling the central group. This is where I am most unsure of what could've been done differently.


Anyway, thank you in advance for the time and the comments!

Best regards,
Daniel Zrno

Both sides made mistakes in the endgame, 
I feel black's problem is earlier, especially where black gave white more room than needed to get stable and make points.
