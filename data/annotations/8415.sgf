C[I'm interested to have some commentaries about the beginning of
the game (1 - 21) because I have the impression that something
is wrong.

I want to reduce his very big moyo with the stone 22 but I think
my invasion wasn't very good.


A: Hello. My name is Alexander, i'm 4k KGS and i will be reviewing this game.

i've added comments throughout the game, concentrating mainly on the fuseki as the game quickly turned into a large capturing race.

also see the last move for the conclusion.];B[dp];W[pd];B[dc]
;W[pp];B[cj]LB[ch:C][ci:A][di:B]C[A: usually b plays at A, B or sometimes at C.]
;W[fq]LB[gd:C][de:A][pj:B]C[generally early in fuseki moves should be prioritized more or less in the following order:
1. play in empty corners.
2. approach or enclose 3-4, 4-5 or 3-5 stones
3. play out an unfinished joseki.
4. approach or enclose 3-3 or 4-4 stone
5. play an ideal 5-point extension (basically -- play in the middle of unoccupied side)
6. play normal 2- or 3-point extensions

following these rules should be enough to get you out to the middle game with an acceptable position.

so in this case A is better, i think, especially since black C10 stone is too far from D17.
you could also consider B or C.];B[dn];W[dr];B[cq]
(;W[ip]LB[hp:A][iq:B]C[A: not good. only A or B is playable in such situation. see variation for explanation when this move is playable.]
(;B[jd]LB[de:A]C[A: good move from b, though you can still play at A. then it would be a completely different game.]
;W[qj]LB[pj:A]C[game turns out to be a moyo game. in such case it's better to play at A, i think.
generally, third line moves are for territory, foruth line -- for influence. in this game you want your influence to be be bigger then that of your opponent.]
(;B[nc]C[A: not the best move here, but now black gives you a chance to come ahead.]
(;W[pf]
(;B[pb]
(;W[qc]C[A: too slow.];B[qb]LB[ij:A]C[A: now b plays a slow move. no need to answer. A is still much more important.]
;W[rb]C[A: thats purely end-game move and what's more important it's a gote move.
in the beginning, keeping sente as much as possible is crucial.]
;B[de]LB[jj:A]C[A: still A is the point to play at];W[np]LB[jj:A]
C[A: still A!];B[jj]C[A: now b is ahead by a lot. his moyo is much bigger than w's]
;W[hc]LB[hd:C][cg:B][ej:A][hj:D]TR[dc][de]C[A: not a good invasion. b' marked stones are strong and high. b' attack will be severe and profitable. i would consider A, B, C or D as points for invasion. though now it's a tough game for w.]
(;B[hd]C[not a good attack. there is a saying "attack from a distance". this way w can make a light form and escape.]

;B[nl];W[ml];B[mk]C[a mistake by b];W[lk];B[kj];W[mj];B[il]
(;W[ik];B[kl];W[jl]
(;B[ll];W[ol];B[nm];W[pk]C[to sum things up:

- follow the proper move order in the beginning
- try to keep sente (while not overplaying at the same time)
- know your joseki
- in moyo game play in the point between two moyos
- when opponent has a larger moyo do not invade deep, consider mild reduction instead.

hope that helps.

Alexander.])
