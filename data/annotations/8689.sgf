The lower left worked ot perfectly for you. Even if White would have been alive in sente, the result would be fine.]

This invasion looks a bit like overplay, it's not necessary right now when there's so much space on the board left.]

Kogos dictionary says n5 is an old joseki. But in that case, K4 isn't in place. Joseki continuation: see first variant.]

this cut feels like overplay again, as yo still have a cut at n3 open.]

the shape is too thin. As W, I would cut immediately]

your group isn't alive, and the cut won't kill anything. So you shouldn't do it.]
