[0.5];W[np];B[pn];W[gp];B[fq]L[dn]M[gp]C[I don't really like F3, it makes it very tempting for white to play  around D6
later, (a) is joseki after white plays the marked stone.];W[gq];B[jn]L[cn]C[Possibly at (a) instead to protect the corner];W[cn];B[cl];W[cq]

;W[lq];B[iq];W[pq]
(;B[qp]L[qq]C[R4 is too generous, you can  afford another exchange like in the middle, if you play
at (a) and white crosses at R4 you end up with a thick wall and then you can
harrass white's bottom right (see variation)];W[qq];B[rq];W[rr];B[sp];W
[op];B[nn];W[qm];B[pm];W[qg];B[qf]M[qg]L[qj]C[White's marked stone has been played to try  to possibly link up with R7 and
create confusion. Its always a good idea to try to split your opponents forces
(ie the same as in the bottom right). I'd play (a) it makes the bottom  right
REALLY strong (the Japanese call Q10-R10 Iron post), and you should kill  one of
whites stones on the RHS];W[ql];B[pl]L[qj]C[Leap ahead to (a),  white should die here, you have lots of surrounding strength,
so you shouldnt be scared of white cutting.];W[ri];B[rj];W[qk];B[qj];W[pk]
;B[ok];W[pg];B[nc];W[oj];B[rk];W[ol];B[om]L[nk]C[There is no way, white  should be able to live on the RHS, he has only 3 liberties,
run out with black (ie (a)), you should kill the RHS and probably either  P8 or
P10 as well];W[nk];B[qn];W[rl];B[rn];W[oh];B[nl];W[ok];B[ml];W[qc];B[qd]

about whether a ladder will succeed or not, try to imagine a diagonal line  (the
triangles) that goes rounghly in the direction of the ladder, if it ends in a
black stone, or the edge of the board, you win (see variation)];W[md];B

[gc]C[I would play (a) and capture the  corner (corners are big). Even if you wanted to play
on the top, (c) would be better than you move. Later on if white can give  the
marked group more liberties, (b) will kill your E18, E17 stones];W[cb];B
[bb]C[Obviously doesnt work, as white can cut at  B17 as in the game. At this stage
you have to protect E18-E17, perhaps, G17..];W[bc];B[cd];W[ba];B[bd];W[ab]

;W[gc];B[jb];W[hb];B[ib];W[em];B[dn]L[fn]C[If you played (a) instead,  white C6 would still have been dead, and you could then
cut at G7. Remember: you have overwhelming thickness here, so you should  ATTACK.]

left, if you play (a) instead you can capture white's marked stone and  maybe fence
off the left centre (see variation)];W[lk];B[kk]L[fm]C[This move is  small, there is no territory to the left of L9 while white still sticks
up from the bottom and top, cut white (a)];W[ln];B[mn];W[lo];B[kn];W[eo]

if you play (a), it will be a 'true'? eye, and you should have it as one  eye,
and another one on the bottom or around D9, I'd play (a)];W[cj];B[dk];W

eyes, this group only has one eye at C6, if white had played (a) next, you  would
have died. It is vital that you play (a) now, and turn D14 into a real  eye.]

than to kill a single stone, play (a) and give yourself the centre  territory here]

what happens once they atari, I'd play (a) instead which protects your  territory
and forces white to connect];W[kh];B[kg];W[jh];B[ii];W[jg];B[jf];W[lr];B

;W[tt]C[General comments
1) When you are on the 4-4 point, and your opponent plays 7-4, joseki is to
play 4-6 (see variation)   (Moves 4, 96)

2) When you can keep you opponent split in two, do so
(Moves 20, 24, 34, 36)

3) When you have lots of stones (thickness) in the area - be aggressive  (Moves 36, 48, 150, 154, 160, 166, 168, 176, 178, 180)]
