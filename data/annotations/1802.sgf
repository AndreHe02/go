AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[You should think of nine stones games as teaching games especially when the gap in your strenghts is so big. You played some good moves but missed a few key moves such as the nets. If you work on some problems this will  improve.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[lc];B[mc];W[le];B[nf]C[Split white stones. Strategy is good!]
;W[qc];B[re]C[Good. Keep white separated.];W[oc]
(;B[pc]C[This gets complicated. You risk getting your stones separated which is dangerous. Better to connect and then cut I think. See variation.]

;W[mb]C[White connected to the outside!];B[ld]LB[nh:a]C[Maybe would be better at "a" to jump away and put pressure on the three stones on the left.]
;W[kd];B[md];W[kc];B[gc]LB[nh:a]C[Big but still "a" is probably more urgent! It puts a lot of pressure on the white stones to the right.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[ql]C[I like this move. lots of pressure on white.]
;W[qm];B[pq];W[rl];B[qj];W[rk];B[rj];W[oi]C[The fight starting here confused me alot.

REPLY: Well white is deliberately starting a difficult position. He is aiming at either your group of five stones at the top or the group of four stones on the right. You probably needed to escape earlier as suggested.

You have done a good job pressurising white on the bottom right side.]

;B[mg];W[je];B[mh];W[ni];B[kf]C[I thought I could respond to a cut at N14 with M13...


You could. but just connecting would probably be better. Still these stones are very heavy. Should have jumped away earlier. Your problems stem from the begining where you let white split you and you never escaped with your split stones. When this happens it's often best to sacrafice and try to gain by sacrafice.]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[jg];B[if];W[lg];B[mf];W[li]C[...but I didn't see this net.]
;B[ig];W[ji];B[ii];W[ki];B[ol]C[Probably one point to the right making the bamboo would not stopped white making an eye]
;W[pl];B[ok];W[qk];B[qg]C[I wanted to connect up, but I'm not sure how urgent this was.

It is a good thing to do, although it does loose the initative.]
;W[pg];B[rf];W[ij]LB[ih:a]C[You have to be careful with these kind of moves. White's objective is to cut and invade. Playing at a to solidify the left side is probably better than the move at K9]

Well see earlier comments.];W[hd]

See variation. Have the option to aim at the cut at M18..];W[hc]

I don't think the cut is a bit concern because those two stones are in atari.]

[so]C[After this, the game is pretty much over, although B goes on to lose many more points.

Yes white is in control. He has captured too many stones I think. But don't be dispondent. You tried hard and played some very good moves.  Study some go problems, say a few each day. Try not to play contact moves all the time. Keep playing and I think you will get strong quickly.]
