C[A game that ends after a fight goes extremely poorly for me in the
lower right. I'm interested to see how I could have gotten a better
result there, averted the disaster altogether, or whether I'm
wrong-headed in being so concerned by it in the first place.

-----

Hi Phil,

I hope, that my comments help you to improve your game. Feel free to contact me, if you have furhter questions
Some advice to begin with:
Your opponent probably caught you on surprise with his unorthodox opening. But there is no need to panic. Try to stay calm and think about, what the disadvantage of his moves are. If you get 3 of 4 corners, then you probably have a lead in territory. So whenever you make at least as much territory as your opponent, you'll easily win the game.
I know, the last sentences probably sounds like trivia, but it helps to understand some moves and variations I suggest during the review. Because playing on or two stones in the center doesn't make any territory. But playing two stones in the corner, already gives you some points.
I noticed that you misjugded several times the status and strenght of different groups. To improve you should practice some tsumego problems. Visit goproblems.com for example.
Last advice I want to give you is to attack and fight whenever your opponent is weak. One to three single stones are allmost allways weak.

Best regards,
Felix a.k.a. Djif-Master];B[pd];W[jj];B[cd];W[jd];B[ec];W[dp]
;B[pp]C[Well, so far you did every thing right. White played a rather unorthodox opening. Securing the corners first is often better. But you also have to understand the meaning of the white stones. White is playing for influence and influence is good for fighting. This means, that whenever a fight occurs in the game White has it a little easier. Especially with the stone in the center, he can easily connect out to the center.
But White does that at the expense of concrete territory. Black already got about 15 points in the upper left corner and occupied 3 of 4 corners.
Your aim should be, to neutralize White's influence while taking territory where possible to expand your lead in concrete points.]
;W[qq]C[This invasion is premature. In my opinion it also contradicts White's original plan. White gives Black perfect influence, which will make White's center stone less worthy. Such an early invasion is often not good.]
(;B[qp]TR[pj]C[Maybe you should wait with such a move. The wall works best, with an extension in the marked area.
For alternatives see variations.];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr]
;B[mq]
(;W[qj]LB[rq:A]C[This is off-book for the joseki in the lower right as I play it, what weakness does it leave in white's shape? What does it take advantage of in black's shape?

-----
Please go back to move 15 and look at the variation first.

So leaving the bottom right unfinished doesn't change anything in the global situation. White could also occupy that spot after finishing the joseki sequence like in the book.
But the disadvantage for White is, that this leaves Black with nice forcing moves against the corner, starting with A.
You don't need to play A right away. Use it as a big pool of ko threats for example. So whenever a ko occurs during this game, White will pay for his mistake later.]
(;B[qg]LB[qg:A][ql:B]C[perhaps an extension from the other side is more appropriate here?

-----
No, I think A is perfect. You are thick in the lower right, so it is good to drive your opponnent against it!]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]TR[jd]C[Wrong direction. The marked white stone again neutralizes the usefullness of the black wall.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re]
(;B[qf]LB[rf:A]C[This move is too slack. Black should put more pressure on White playing A.
The following variations seem all good for Black.

I marked the most likely variation path with A.

Maybe you think, that I can read out all this variation during a game, this is not the case. But in my experience your move is just too passive.]
;W[rf];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[rg]LB[qh:A]TR[jd]C[Because of the marked stone, blacks wall is not efficent.
White is also connected out to the right.
