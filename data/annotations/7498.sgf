C[Hi I (ncast) marked some moves which I think would have been better. All my commentes start with a #. As far as I can see it, my major mistakes were the wrong answer to the white invasion at move 34 and the attack at move 90.
Thank you very much for reviewing my game.
Cheers
Niko

Yes, white's invasion both lived inside and ran out to the center and black got little compensation. The reduction at 90 is a lot harder to deal with, since your moyo was still pretty open, and the stone could connect to the left or on the bottom.]

;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[cj];B[gc]C[#is a shimari at the top or a expansion on the right bigger?

If you wanted to shimari at the top, it would've been better to play a 3-4 point. With a 4-4 stone, the corner is not secure even after a shimari (various 3-3 invasions still exist). It would be better to leave it for now. G17 is fine, an expansion on the right or bottom would also be fine.]

(;B[kr]CR[lo]C[#I wanted to destroy the potential eye space on the bottom. But I think a keima would have put as much pressure on the white group and it also nicely extends the mojo on the right.

White will find it very hard to get eye space on the bottom even without L2. J4 is an important point for both sides. See variation.]

Yes, the lower-right territory is bigger. Play a contact move. White is going to take a large chunk of side territory though, you have to compensate by building outside influence to attack L3 or M17.]
