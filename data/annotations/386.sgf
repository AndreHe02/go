[qq:B]C[R: B can choose here between A (actually played) and B.]
(;B[on]LB[np:A][om:B]N[A (game)]C[R: Here White played A. Although I think B would have been a better choice.]

(;W[np]N[A (game)];B[pl]MA[qm]C[R: I don't think this move is on the right place.

Obviously, Black thinks about killing the white marked stone. That is impossible because White can crawl along the third line.

Black will build influence as a result of this fight. But that seems to me inconsistent with his own strategy. By placing his two first stones on the 3-4 points Black indicates that his strategy is territory-oriented.]
;W[ql]LB[qp:A][qi:B][qk:C]C[EE: This is somewhat heavy and slow. White could consider sacrificing the stone and play kikashi from a) and b). Another idea is to jump to c) - a lighter approach.]
;B[pk];W[qk]LB[qj:A]C[EE: Now white should really have jumped to a). Never push from behind voluntarily!]
;B[pj];W[qj]LB[pi:A][qi:B]C[EE: Same comment applies here as for the last move, with added emphasis for each step.

This side is left like this now, but another move here is urgent and the one who plays here first will have a local advantage. a) is a good point for both. I wonder if Black can't even play b).]
;B[qq];W[qp]LB[pp:A]C[R: This should be at A I think.];B[pp];W[qo];B[oq]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[qn];W[rn];B[pn];W[rp];B[op]LB[pm:A]MA[np]
C[R: White got the corner and part of the right side. Black got a thick wall.

But somehow I feel that this thickness won't be of great use for Black because the aji of the cut at A and in the marked white stone promise to nullify Black's influence later.

EE: ... and because White got sente to disturb Black's development of the wall. But getting influence early is often good.]
;W[ed]LB[hq:A][jq:B][eq:C][kq:D]C[EE: A big point, but more urgent is to use the precious sente to hinder Black's development on the lower side. The sheer length of Black's wall should make it clear that it should dominate the strategy here. White should play somewhere on the lower side.
Maybe a). If next Bb-Wc, Black does not get full value from his thickness. If instead Black invades (around c), White has room to extend to d). In any case, it will be hard for Black to attack White, which after all is what a wall is best suited for.]
;B[gc]LB[ep:A]C[EE: A play on the lower side, for example a kakari at a) is better - see previous comment.]
;W[df]LB[eb:A][fe:B][cc:C]C[R: Not joseki but I like it :)

Standard joseki plays are A, B and C.

A looks too dangerous.

B is out of question because Black gets the corner and thickness along the G-line.

C isn't good either because all depends on a ladder which is in favor for Black. Again Black will get major thickness on top.

(Compare to variations shown in lower right corner.)

EE: IMHO, the importance of the lower side overshadows any local joseki in upper left. Just tenuki, or do whatever necessary to get sente to use at the bottom!
To create and destroy moyo should take first priority!];B[ec]C[EE: Btw, the 3 joseki suggested in the last move all have the aim to prevent the Black connection. Therefore, White's last move was slack, locally.]

(;W[qh]LB[qc:A]C[R: White should have attached at A.

EE: r12 achieves very little. Bzzzt! THE LOWER SIDE! :-)];B[qd]N[Game];W
[fq]LB[dq:A][hq:B]C[R: This is of course a very weak shimari because Black can easily invade, e.g. at A.

But I saw this frequently in pro games and I said to myself: Well, why not? :-)

EE: Good, the lower side at last! :-) But it leaves Black room to extend all the way to b), so maybe White should go 2 steps further. (Cf. comments to move #30.)]

(;B[dj]N[Game];W[ci]C[R: I think this was the right side because an attack from beneath would have pushed Black towards the weak white group in upper left.

EE: Contact or near-contact moves don't qualify as "attacks"; they are for defensive purposes. This shape "shoulder hit from beneith" is generally considered bad style, and this position is no exception.]
;B[cj]C[EE: This is why it is bad - Black was induced to strengthen himself, and White's stone looks lonely against the black iron pillar.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[ej]LB[fh:A][bi:B]C[EE: The end result here is that Black got a thick nice shape, while White is lacking of liberties for his two stones and Black has a) and b) to aim for. Do you agree now that the "shoulder hit from beneith" was bad?

R: Yes.];W[jj]LB[ki:A][pm:B][iq:C][cm:D]C[R: This move is a mistake for several reasons.

First, Black can now invade the lower left corner.

EE: No, that would be a serious mistake, as my comment to the variation to move #42 showed.

R: Second, *if White wants to move there* this move should have been at A in order to support the cut at B.

EE: Might be, but the fundamental principle here is "side before center". Thus around c) to neutralize the black thickness is best. d) to take Black's base away is 2nd best choice.]
;B[cn]LB[iq:A]C[R: This move seems wrong to me. A fighting will start here after which White ensures his lower left corner.   EE: You are too concerned with the territory in lower left! What is important here is Black's thickness on the right and his group on the left which now got a base on the side. White should try to get a presence where it hurts Black's thickness the most, thus play around a).]
;W[do]C[EE: Interesting, perhaps even good!];B[dn];W[en];B[em];W[fn]C[EE: White builds some thickness of his own to counter Black's. Unfortunately for him, Black has sente, which he uses well.]
;B[jq]LB[cl:A][cg:B][rb:C][mb:D][rj:E][sq:F][jc:G][lq:H][bb:I][cr:J]C[R: I evaluate the territorial balance at this point in the following way:

A and B are about equal.
C - D and E - F are about equal too.

The territories at G and H can't be counted yet because they can be nullified by invasions.

The corner I is smaller than corner J.   So it seems to me that White is slightly ahead now.

EE: Agree about the territory assessment, with the adjustment that H is hard to invade deeply. But to judge who is ahead, we must also look at the balance of power, and Black's wall is impressive and promises territory directly or indirectly, so for this reason, I would take Black here.]
;W[jd]LB[pi:A][pm:B][jo:C]C[R: This move was wrong. The biggest move would have been at A because it threatens the cut at B and builds territory on upper right side.

EE: a) would make nice shape locally, but the played move is  big. Reducing the bottom around c) could also be considered.]
;B[pi];W[lp]LB[ko:A]C[R: This should be at A.

EE: Yes, too deep.];B[lr]LB[ko:A]C[R: A move at A would probably have killed White's two stones.

EE: Black must learn to use his thickness to attack. This move just defends. Both players stick too close to Black's strong wall in the following sequence.]

;W[jn];B[qi];W[ri];B[qf];W[ph];B[lj];W[pm];B[om];W[ol]C[R: I didn't read it out here during the game. The ladder doesn't work. So this cut is used not right.]
;B[nl];W[oi];B[nj];W[fm];B[el];W[in]LB[lc:A]C[R: Another weak move.

Something like at A would have been better.];B[rg];W[rh];B[ld];W[qe];B[re]
;W[pd];B[qc];W[pf];B[jf]LB[hd:A][gd:B][he:C]C[R: This move is big because it captures the marked stone building a big territory on the top.

White is not leading anymore.

EE: I wouldn't say "capture". a-b-c and White is out, although Black has something to chase.]
;W[he]
(;B[id]LB[ie:A]C[R: The right move would have been at A.

EE: It's not easy to say. The game variation is often better style. White can continue differently than you suggested (see var. of var.)]
;W[ie]N[Game];B[je];W[hd];B[ic];W[hc]MA[jd]C[R: This way White gets maximum profit from his marked stone.]
;B[jc];W[gb];B[fb];W[gd];B[fc];W[ib]
(;B[jb]LB[bo:A]C[R: This move is too early. It is an endgame move - worth only around 6-7 pts and gote.

EE: More like 16 points and probably even more! See var. for previous move. Still - a move like a) might be sente and should thus be played first.]
;W[be];B[bd];W[bi];B[bj];W[od]LB[hq:A]C[R: Probably A would have been bigger.]
;B[oc];W[fh];B[hj];W[hg];B[ih];W[ig];B[jg];W[jh];B[ji];W[ii]MA[jj]C[R: Saving the marked white stone is bigger here.]

;B[hn];W[hm];B[im];W[ho];B[gn];W[go];B[gl];W[fl];B[gm];W[gk]LB[fk:A]C[R: A would have been more effective.

EE: Note that White's group M4 is now cut off and yet without two eyes. I would feel very anxoius about that.]
;B[hl];W[ek]LB[mo:A][mp:B][lo:C]C[EE: If this isn't sente (is it?) then a-b-c kills White.]
;B[gj];W[kq];B[mo]C[R: This was a mistake worth more than 15 pts.];W[jr]
C[R: Here comes the reason why :-)

EE: Black should play ko (see var!).]

C[R: Now the endgame (yose) has begun.

Variation A shows my (R's) estimate of the current score.

The game is very close. Black is leading by 2.5 pts.

EE: The game is not close. White is leading by more than 10. :-)]
(;B[ai]LB[ga:A][ne:B][qg:C][fd:D][if:E]N[game]C[R: In the endgame, every move has to be evaluated very carefully.   In general, sente moves should be preferred to gote moves. As a thumb rule, gote moves should only be played if they are twice as big as the current biggest sente move.

Black has here good sente moves at A, B, C, D and E. A seems to me the biggest because it also is "reverse sente" meaning it prevents a white sente move at F19.

This move (a11) is worth 2 pts. But it is *gote*! So lets say Black is now ahead with 4.5 pts...]
;W[ah];B[al];W[mh]C[R: A sente move worth around 4 pts.];B[ni];W[fa]C[R: One pt gote?

EE: White will get *either* F19 or K19, but not both, and K19 looks like the obvious choice as it is certain sente. However, F19 seems to create seki threats against the corner, so maybe it is all right.]
;B[ea];W[ga];B[ia];W[hb];B[aj];W[bh];B[lg]C[R: 4-5 pts in sente.

EE: Hardly, closer to 1 point. But the *threat* that makes it sente is easily over 5 points; I guess that was you really meant?

R: Yes, that's what I meant here. I seem to mix up always the value of the move and the value of the threat if it's ignored.]
;W[mg];B[le];W[me]LB[ne:A]C[R: Definitely A and nothing but A :-)

EE: Yes. :-)];B[ne];W[md]C[R: 1 pt sente

EE: 2 pts  (N17 and O17).];B[mc];W[mi]C[R: 1 pt sente];B[mj];W[ln]C[R: 1 pt sente]
;B[lm];W[ad];B[ac];W[da]C[R: This brings 5 pts in sente.

EE: Nice move!];B[ca];W[eb];B[db];W[ea];B[bb];W[jm]C[R: One point in sente.]
;B[jl];W[ki]C[R: Another 2 pts in sente.];B[jh];W[li];B[kj];W[qg]C[R: Securing own position in sente.]
;B[rf];W[nf];B[oe];W[of];B[nc]LB[lf:A][kf:B][lh:C]C[R: Still kept sente.

EE: This last secuence just wasted ko threats and liberties (a-b-c is no longer possible). Actually, you lost about 2/3 of point in sente.]
;W[sg]C[EE: Good, 4 points!];B[sf];W[sh];B[rd]C[Still sente.];W[ks]C[R: 2 pts in sente.]
;B[no];W[ha];B[ja];W[co]C[R: No sente left. That's why White plays the biggest gote move.]
;B[lf]C[R: Black got sente. One pt here.];W[rj];B[bn]C[R: Zero pt gote :-)]

EE: Sente - Black should not answer White's block.];W[qs];B[os];W[js]C[R: 0 pt sente]
;B[ls];W[if]C[R: 1 pt gote

EE: Since a Black move here has a sente followup, it should actually be counted as a 2 pt move.]
;B[kn]C[R: 1 pt sente.];W[ko];B[tt];W[tt]C[R: White wins with 14.5 pts - 17 pts gained in the endgame.

EE: Or 3 points gained in the endgame, compared to my variation. :*)

Eventful game! Keep on fighting and learning, and you will both become strong players. I hope my comments were of some help.]

[kn][if][fd][hb]MA[ln][jm][mh][ne][ja]N[A]C[EE: White can push at K7, M6, N12 and O15 in sente. You should always assume that the player who can make sente moves also gets them. This makes Black's territory 7 points smaller and White's 4 points larger (around P15 and Q13). It is not reasonable to expect Black to get all the points around L14 or to block at T13. Who has sente around K19 isn't clear. Anyway, I think your estimation is off by about 13-15 points. Sorry :-)

R: I'm glad I was wrong :-)])
(;LB[ia:A][mh:B][ne:C]N[a shodan's yose]C[EE: This is how I would finish the game. Cor comparing sizes, sente gives double value and follow-up half value. There seems to be three really big points (labeled)

Ba is 2 points (L18, L19) in reverse sente (probably) + an 8 point gote followup threat (H18) = (2+ 8/2)*2 = size 12.

Bb is about 4 points in reverse sente 4*2 = size 8.

Bc takes 4 white points (3 around P12 plus Q13), while a white play there would have a 5-point sente follow-up = size 9.

It is quite a hard problem, and the moves aren't independent, but let us assume Black plays a).]
