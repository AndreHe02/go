C[Hello.
I prepared this sgf file a little, put some questions. I think I failed big time in opening of this game, but Im weak against this type of influence oriented strategies.

[kb\]: Hi, I will do my best.  I have only reviewed the first several moves, since the review was requested of the opening.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[op];W[dc];B[fq];W[cn];B[jq]C[I knew my opponent will play for influence, so I wanted to use some unordinary strategy here

[kb\]: Looks fine to me - K3 will look good if you get to play R4.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[ne]C[[kb\]: This move is unorthodox - usually played when Black is threatening a very large moyo.  It has the side effect of devaluing a move at R3.

Two choices - approaching the top left corner with D14, or playing where White should have played.]
(;B[pi]C[Is this move correct or should I play on top?];W[id]
;B[cf];W[cd]
(;B[cl]C[[kb\]: This is an overplay.  Where do you think White is going to play?  There is no way White will let you play at D11, no matter how much has to be paid in the lower left corner.]
;W[ci]TR[cd][dc][id][cn]C[[kb\]: C11 is the perfect invasion and puts all of the marked stones to work.

The game is very hard for Black now.  You must put C8 to use against the lower left.]
(;B[el]C[[kb\]: It's too early!];W[fp];B[eq];W[dq];B[gp];W[fo]
C[[kb\]: Now what should Black do...]
(;B[ef]C[[kb\]: You have set yourself up for another devastating White move at E11.]
;W[ei];B[fd];W[gq];B[hq];W[gr];B[go];W[gn];B[gl]C[[kb\]: Important, but this gives up enormous amounts of points at the bottim.]
;W[gi]C[[kb\]: Ouch.]
(;B[fh]C[[kb\]: This can only hurt the Black stones below - just make shape at G14.]
;W[fi];B[eb];W[il]C[after this move everything was pretty desperate to not let white win so easily, and complicate game to give me a chance to comeback]
