[qe:F][op:G][oq:H]C[Usually in the opening, a shimari or kakari with a 3-4 is played before a large extension like this.  So any of A-H would probably be bigger.]
;W[nq];B[jc];W[pf];B[dj];W[hp];B[qk];W[qi];B[qm]LB[qn:A]C[It's probably best to play A here instead. White can invade, but that's ok, you have plenty of room to run.]
;W[rn];B[rm];W[qn]
(;B[sn]C[This is a double sente point, so it's good in the early endgame, but it's too early for this stage of the game.  I don't really believe this helps much with settling your group.  See variations]

;W[lm];B[ml];W[mm];B[nk];W[oj];B[ok];W[jm];B[mn]C[The proverb says "cut first, think later", but I think this isn't a very promising cut.]
;W[no];B[lo];W[lq];B[mp]TR[lm][mm][jm][hp]C[I don't think this is a significant threat.  White's corner is pretty solid.  If you want to attack something, you might attack the marked stones, but they're going to be able to run and make life easily, and you'll probably just chase them up against your left side, reducing the left's potential to grow.]

;W[eo];B[fl];W[im];B[jn];W[dm];B[dl]LB[dq:A]C[Note that this exchange has really hurt A.  Anytime you invade, think about where you may get chased, and how that might hurt the surrounding groups and frameworks.  You may guess wrong, but it's still better to try, and you'll get better at it with practice.]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[bm];B[ek]TR[hm][jm][im][gl][lm][mm]LB[fk:A]C[I think this might be a little slow.  Note that white has a weak group now, begging you to chase it and build territory.  If you want to play slow-and-steady, A probably works to defend your group and put pressure on white at the same time.]
;W[dp];B[gk];W[dr];B[eq]LB[cq:A]C[I think you've already lost the lower left now - it's probaby better to go after something more attainable at this point.  I say this because it's going to be Very difficult to make two eyes in this little space if white plays A.]
;W[er]C[...and perhaps even if not.  :)];B[fq];W[fr];B[gr];W[gq]
;B[fp];W[cq];B[bl];W[al];B[ak];W[am];B[bj];W[ll];B[mk]LB[lk:A]
C[I like A better.  It protects the eye, allows you to run out, and puts more pressure on the white group.]
;W[lj];B[pk]C[Now you have an assured two eyes in the middle right, but your opportunity to chase the white center group isn't as promising.]
;W[pj]
(;B[rj]C[This is another end game move. It's a good move, but the wrong time for it - too early.

You still might be able to chase the white group a little, or you could just solidify your framework in the upper left.  See variations]
;W[ri];B[sk]LB[si:A]C[This too is endgame.

But if you want an endgame move, A is faster than this.];W[lg]
;B[ph]LB[nf:A][ng:B]C[This is good fighting spirit, but I fear this is an invasion doomed to trouble (for black) from the beginning.  It's going to be hard to run out if white plays at A or B, and there's just about no way you're going to make two eyes in that cramped space.

Just to be sure: this doesn't threaten a cut.];W[qg];B[qh];W[rh]
;B[si];W[sh];B[oh];W[nf];B[sj]C[Endgame!  Very small!  There are much bigger points on the board right now.  Save this for the very end of the game - it's only worth 0.5 points.]
;W[mc];B[nh]C[This is a very slow move, and not going to get you out of the trap. It really just consigns another stone to near-certain capture.]
;W[lk];B[mj];W[mi];B[ni];W[mh];B[qj]C[This is forcing, sente even, but note that it doesn't really help you, or hurt white.  Your middle right group was already assured life, you didn't add a point to your score, and you didn't take a point away from white.  The only way this is going to help is if white misses the really obvious atari.

Did this move hurt you?  In a way.  It erases a ko threat you could have played later if a ko fight arises. So it doesn't hurt you much, but it's better to save it. It's really a pretty big ko threat.]
;W[pi];B[pg]C[This too throws away a good ko threat.  The double atari is good, but white is almost certain to see it.]
;W[qf];B[ng];W[mg];B[of];W[oe];B[mf];W[ne];B[le]TR[ph][qh][oh]
[nh][ni][pg][ng][of]C[This is not a cuting sequence.  White can easily capture the marked stones.  See variation.]

;W[jg];B[jf];W[kg];B[kd]LB[ig:A][hf:B][gf:C][gg:D]C[This wasn't really a weakness that needed to be defended, IMO.

I'd probably play at A or B to develop that potentially-huge upper left corner.  Maybe even C or D.

You don't have to be able to hang onto the entire upper left, to reap benefit from Threatening to secure the entire upper left.]
;W[hh];B[hl]LB[ik:A]C[I think A is faster, if you want to eat into this small territory]
;W[il];B[hk]LB[ik:A][hj:B]C[A is faster. It does give a white peep at B, but that's probably ok in this case.]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[gd];B[hj]LB[ij:A]TR[je][mf][le][lf][ke][jf][kd]
[jc]C[A is worth far less than the marked stones.  I believe you should defend the marked stones and worry about A later.]

Something like A is both larger and sente.  We're in the endgame now.

B is good too.];W[fh];B[hf];W[id];B[ic];W[jd];B[kb];W[lc];B[kc]
