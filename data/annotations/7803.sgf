AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,
this is an H2 game and I'm playing White. Usually I play around a KGS-2k-level, but I just keep losing and I just don't know why I just mess my games up...
This game is not that typical, though : once in the game I play a gross blunder, and give up a big chunk with no good reason (so I know why I lost it anyway ^^). Let's please forget these ones and see where are my other mistakes, mostly about direction plays and probably misreadings. I am sure I missed sharp attacks more than once, although I'm trying not to play attacking moves so early that the fight can't end up in my favor to some extent.

Thanks a lot !

(;W[el]LB[el:A][bn:B][fo:D][cr:C]C[I thought about :
B6<C2<F5<E8
not considering moves in direct relation with the NE corner yet (B tenuki seems like an overplay to me, because B's left stones still lack shape ; am I right ?).
As Black played definitely high, B6 seems very submissive, but C2 inducing B's jump to the center and at best flattening the loosely settled lower side doesn't seem optimal to me.
Thinking about it once more, F5 seems fine, working well with a side that needs an extra move very soon. I would really enjoy some savvier comments about this kind of direction plays I couldn't ponder that well in the game.

KP
I like f5, because it is good shape on the lower side.
K10 is not realy an overplay, because b can still move out or live with c2.]

Well this is a handicap game, so black is supposed to be ahead by 20 Points. You can only change that, if b makes a mistake. Unless you find a mistake, dont think you can make it even.]

I'm afraid B can ruin W's eye space in sente and chase it with good profit on the high side at least.

The real problem is, that you aproached from the wrong side with r14.
S9 seems fine.];B[pq]

bearing in mind that you still have r8 and p11, I would bite my teeth an tenuki with something like k17. But again, the real Problem is the mistake in direktion with r14.]

[dr]C[B considers with good reason that he already won. I'm not asking that during yose (I guess I catch up most of the points left on the board) but I'm open to any comment.

basicaly i have one Idea: Play more clam.

dont try unsound moves, because you feel the handicap. This is not the way to catch up.

k4 ist the wrong shape with d2
The kakari at r14 was clearly the wrong direction
Trying to kill with g7 and g8 is wide of the mark.

Play strong moves in important parts of the board and wait for chances. Dont expect to catch up, as long as the opponent plays good moves.
