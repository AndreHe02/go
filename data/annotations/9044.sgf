C[Hagios: Hello, I go by Hagios and I'll be reviewing the main points of your game, as well as attempting to address any questions you provided.  From now on I'll preface my remarks with "H:"]
;B[pd]C[Hello dear reviewer,

my nickname on KGS is Oceandrop and I played white in this game with 6.5 Komi, I think he did much better in the opening stage and I feel uncomfortable about it, because I don't see my mistakes, though I could catch up in the middle game though some mistakes on his site, I lost because in the end I did an obvious mistake in endgame and he killed also a big corner group, though I didn't realize it was dead until nearly the very end, so I always thought the endgame mistake wasn't a big deal. But you will see what I mean.

 I added comments on the way through the game, with questions or just my thoughts to help you review this game :-)
-];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]LB[ce:A][pj:B][fq:C]C[Oceandrop: I normally play 4-4 with both stones as white when I have 6.5 komi, but I recently thought it would good to try out new stuff instead of doing old things over and over, so I thought he would approach my 3-4 stone, but he didn't.

H: This is a relatively early stage, so there is not a set way to deal with your opening.  I'd consider A, B and C.]
;B[fq];W[cn]C[OD: I wanted to get sente with this move.];B[dr]
C[H: If you wanted sente, you can take it now.]
(;W[cq];B[jp]C[H: This is a bit far.  See the branch to see a brief analysis of this shape.]

(;W[nc];B[nd]C[OD: I am very uncomfortable with the O16 move, I always feel the opponnent gets a better formation with the rest of his stones, I will have too look up more josekis from it haha I am so lazy when it comes to studying joseki deeply. If you have any comments on it, I would appreciate them also^^]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[lc];B[pg]LB[pf:A]C[H: This opponent is taking more than his fair share.  This stone should have been played at A, but there's no immediate way to attack it.]
;W[de]C[OD: Was this move wrong by me? I have thought about approaching his 4-4 stone in the lower right (Q4) with R6, but I was unsure what I should do when he would pincer my R6 approach. Also I thought about 3-3 point, but I am always afraid to play it because the opponnent gets a wall in the direction he choices, but maybe 3-3 would have been a better idea than D15?

If you have any comments on this situation I would love them^^; I was very lost and ended up playing D15, but after the game I felt that this was kinda slow because black is developing a framework and I his stones work better together than mine. So if you have any idea what I could have done instead, I am open for everything haha!

H: d15 is fine.  It aims to work with your other two groups on the board.

Black is expansive, but thin.  If you continue to play thickly, you must have a mind to starting advantageous fights in order to keep the game in balance.

To respond to the question about 3,3 invasion: I wouldn't do so right now.  r6 is more likely to end in your favor than r3  with the current game state.]
;B[qm]C[H: Now I would consider 3,3];W[lf]C[OD: I thought this move was good, because it is on the border of two frameworks and works kinda with my D15 formation, but now I feel it might have been wishfull thinking, because again I give black just a free move to strengthen his framework?

H: You are also building a framework.  Your thinking was good.  However, as black, I will play p3 without hesitation and say, "thank you."  This was a good idea, with bad timing.]
;B[cg]C[OD: I thought he would play something like F5 after my M14, or P3.

H: Black appears to be afraid of your framework.  This is a move you must be prepared for, after playing d15.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[dh];B[di];W[cf];B[ck]C[H: Good time for 3,3]

(;W[fo];B[go]LB[hq:A]C[H: Now the weaknesses around A are gone.]
;W[pq]C[OD: Move Q3 was something new for me, I saw it sometimes in pro games when black has much stones surrounding, so I wanted to experiment with it, though it ended kinda good for me, I felt that this wasn't the right move and also black made some mistakes I think, instead of attatching, I also thought about Q10, I am not very experienced with frameworks and all that stuff it seems, I have to play more games where my opponnent plays like this I think, so I can learn how to handle it haha!]

(;B[pj];W[pi]LB[qn:A][qs:B]C[OD: I actually thought my corner had enough space for making live.

H: You are alive after A or B.];B[qi];W[pk];B[oj];W[ri];B[qk]
;W[qh];B[pl];W[qg];B[qf];W[rf];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[oi];B[ok]
;W[om];B[hg];W[mm]C[OD: Instead of N7, maybe answering H13 at H15 is much better? With N7 I wanted to threaten to surround R7 group, but maybe again just wishfull thinking? Though I know now because of the end of the game that R2 hasn't enough space to make eyes if black first plays, so Maybe N7 is good becaue I am jumping out with my group?

H: It would be a lot of work to kill r7, and simply burying the group doesn't help you much, here.]
;B[hd];W[mj];B[qn];W[qo];B[mk]LB[no:A]C[H: Be mindful of the ko at A]

(;W[lj];B[ml]

[rl:2][bp:5][rq:6][ir:30]TB[pk][or]C[H: Black now has a flexible shape.

If we count the potential territory, we can formulate our tactics as we approach the middle game.

W: 47,5 (,5 komi is assumed)
B: 47

For good ideas regarding territory estimation, look at Positional Judgement by Cho Chikun.  Keep in mind I'm just estimating cash.  We aren't factoring in the territory which black might accrue with the h16 group, nor white's perilous group at h15.

Having an idea that we are close to even, score-wise, and seeing that black has a large territory built out at the bottom, and is working on destroying white's top area, we can formulate a plan, with the following information:

The game is close, so we can't avoid fights.
Black has no solid territory near h16.
White has a group which is in danger (h14).
Black doesn't have any eyes yet.
Black's shape has many cutting points, but exploiting them might not be easy.

The areas my eyes immediately go to are marked.]

(;W[kl]LB[lm:A]C[OD: I wanted to harass R6 and at the same time enlarge my middle ground, keep in mind I thought R2 was alive^^;

H: This is a fine thought.  r2 is alive still, but is guaranteed only one eye in the corner in this shape.

To note, a play at A could have sealed black in.  See variation.]
;B[ll];W[km];B[lm];W[ln];B[kn];W[bn];B[kk]C[H: Giving up two stones here is very painful.]

C[OD: I think without this mistake, it would still have been close, even with the dead of my R2 group.

H: This mistake was worth 12 points.  This would have made the game very close indeed.]

I hope I will learn much from your review and thanks in advance for your time! I hope you enjoyed it too!

H: All in all your game was fairly nicely played.  I recommend some tesuji--especially a book such as "Get Strong at the Life and Death" which focuses on shapes such as the one you had in your corner.  This will help you to learn to use the corner well in life and death situations, and avoid miscalculations which might lead to losing won games.]
