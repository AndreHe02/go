;B[pd];W[pp];B[cq];W[dd];B[dn];W[nc]C[usually B will extend from start point stone  as extension is bigger than one from 3x3  point stone [tom\]]
;B[qf];W[jd]C[ javi 6k : it is better extend from a 4-4  stone than from a 3-3 stone (8)
This is a reasonable comment [tom\]];B[nq];W[lq];B[jq];W[lo]
;B[jo]
(;W[np]C[The black O3 stone is not dead. N3 will  either connect to B left side, live in corner,  or move out to center.  So lots of aji there.  [tom\]]

(;B[qn];W[qp];B[pj]C[This long B extension is easily invaded at  R8 but is not a bad move. [tom\]]
;W[cl]C[good, checks further B extension here  [tom\]];B[cf]
;W[ch]C[good pincer if W can reinforce before B is  able to split at C10 [tom\]]
;B[fc]C[hard to say what is best for B here. B  would like to leave with sente after some  reduction of W potential so can either play  Q6 or N3. [tom\]]
;W[ee];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[gd];B[pc]C[perhaps B G17 is better first [tom\]]
;W[gc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[bf];B[cj]C[now W E18 is big and may threaten to kill  [tom\] this B invasion is also large]
;W[bn];B[cm];W[bm];B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[dj]C[difficult cut for W. Better if there was a  possible cut at D7 as well. [tom\]]
;B[co];W[fp]C[pretty deep invasion but B seems to be  ahead in territory an potential [tom\]]
;B[gq];W[gp];B[hq]C[trying to deprive W of base? reasonable  approach here [tom\]]
;W[fq];B[cn]C[don't know if this connection was really  needed. I would most likely hope to live in  corner if W cuts here [tom\]]
;W[gn];B[bj]C[this is quite large [tom\]];W[bk];B[ak];W[bl]
;B[di];W[ej];B[ci];W[dh];B[ei];W[cr]C[nice W placement. perhaps B can block at  B3 as W B5 doesn't make life [tom\]]
;B[bo];W[dq]C[now W is nearly alive [tom\]];B[bq];W[km];B[lr]
C[maybe better to try running out to center  first so B can either be fearless about  using aji of O3 or force W to spend a move  removing that aji [tom\]]
;W[mr]C[B N3 leads to connecting or life in corner.  N3 L3 O2 L2 Q2 lives in corner, otherwise  B connects to K2 stones. If live in corner  then K2 stones jump to K7 to escape  [tom\]]
;B[kr];W[mq];B[ir];W[ql]C[maybe W is a bit ahead now because of  potential to expand into center from upper  side group [tom\]]
;B[qk]C[I would probably try B Q7 to try connecting  up R6 stone. If it works than W loss is  greater than B loss of territory [tom\]]
;W[pl];B[rk];W[rl];B[ne]C[invading at M17 also possible [tom\]]
;W[ld];B[fb];W[ph]C[nice [tom\]];B[oi];W[ng];B[oh];W[og];B[pg]
;W[pf];B[qg];W[oe];B[nd];W[mc];B[od];W[ob];B[pb]C[B at N14 is sente. [tom\]]
;W[mf]C[perhaps B at N14 was better as it is  sente [tom\]]
;B[mi];W[pk];B[qj];W[gb];B[ga];W[ha];B[fa];W[ib]C[W is pretty far ahead so B needs heroic  measures [tom\] there is potential at E2  combined with trying to seal in W group,  P5-P7, B12-E13, G8 to cap LL W group and  try to net D10 stones [tom\]]
;B[fj];W[pa];B[qa];W[oa];B[qb];W[ek]C[white has a small lead, 10 pts, so can  play somewhat conservatively. black  must take some risks [tom\]]
;B[fk];W[el];B[dm];W[fl];B[gi];W[fh];B[fi];W[lh];B[eh];W[eg]
C[now B just play at F13 and W must  defend against D13 so B reduces center  [tom\]]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[df];W[ef];B[gl]C[good to harass the weak white stones  [tom\]]
;W[fm];B[gm];W[fn]C[now push thru at K7. this threatens F4  stones, prepares to reduce huge right  corner, make a small territory in center  [tom\]]
;B[br]C[E2 is also good [tom\]];W[in]C[good, induced by B2. better if B played  around here first [tom\]]
;B[jn];W[ip];B[iq];W[jm];B[io];W[hn];B[hp];W[hg]C[now W well ahead [tom\]]
;B[lg];W[lf]C[seems W could just L12];B[mh];W[mg];B[li];W[kh]
;B[ki];W[jh];B[fd]C[M13 was a big gain for W [tom\]];W[fe];B[rq]
;W[rp];B[oq];W[pq];B[nm];W[nk]C[W doesn't need all this. Probably just cut  at P6 [tom\]]
;B[mk];W[ml]C[W better at O8 [tom\]];B[nl];W[ok];B[lk]C[now W Q6 or P6 [tom\]]
;W[ll]C[greedy [tom\]];B[oo]C[good timing [tom\]];W[op];B[sn]
C[S6 maybe simpler? [tom\] see next  comments];W[sl]C[W Q6 would let 2 B stones live and kill  other 3 B stones [tom\]]
;B[rn]C[T6 now not needed so S6 previously  much better. now could play at Q7 and kill  [tom\]]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[on]C[if W simply connects at P8 then cuts at  Q5 or O6 will finish B [tom\]]
