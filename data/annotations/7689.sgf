;B[qd]C[Wonodan: Hi, I will be your reviewer for this game. If you still have questions after this, you can send them by e-mail to lauri.vihavainen@gmail.com or by leaving me a message on KGS.

Your first move is nice, you seem to know the opening etiquette pretty well for 10k.]

The problem here is that your influence isn't exactly thickness, since it's a bit thin.
