;B[pd]C[I was playing plack in this game. I was 24K playing against 22K.


Thank you for letting me review this game. I'll try my best to make useful comments but please keep in mind that I'm only 10 kyu so not everything I say will be correct.]

(;B[qp]MA[np]C[Since white is already pincered, he doesn't have enough room to make a base. O4 is a better attack because it doesn't strengthen white. See variation.]
;W[qo];B[mp]CR[oq]MA[np]C[O4 puts a little more pressure on the white stones and defends the weak spot at P3 better.]
;W[ql];B[qk];W[pl];B[qg];W[ce];B[id];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[lc]
C[Good move! Making a base for yourself and denying white one at the same time.]
;W[le];B[fc];W[ch];B[fq]C[Attacking the white group in the upper right is more important.]
;W[hq];B[jq];W[eq]MA[fp]C[Up to this point, I think my development was fine. Looking at it now, my next move probably shouldn't have been into the corner, but to go after the stone on H3, maybe with H4. Yes or no? The invasion into the corner wasn't really successful and cost me on the outside.

Your development is fine indeed. At this point in the game you're ahead.
I think playing on the outside is better too, but you should play F4. See variations.]

(;W[cn]C[White should kill now. See variation.]
(;B[ng]TR[qg]CR[oe]MA[br][nf]C[The lower left corner is most important. White can kill with A4 and black can live with B2. Locally O14 is better since it threatens to cut and because  of the stone at R13 white cannot do much damage by playing P15. See variation.]
;W[lg];B[ol];W[om];B[nl];W[nm];B[mi];W[ck];B[jf]MA[jg]C[K13 makes escaping harder for white.]
;W[kh];B[ee]C[I had been making great profit by chasing him up to this point. Playing E15 gives him a chance to breath. Should I have kept up with pressure with L10 or J12?

I think J12 is best because it's hard to make much territory in the centre and J12 could help to prevent the right side from growing too large.]
;W[gf];B[eg];W[gh];B[ih]C[Good idea to keep white separated]

(;B[gn]MA[hi]C[Our stones are becomig scattered with very little good shape.

H11 is a good move to prevent white from making too much territory in that area. See variation]
;W[em];B[br]C[Finally :)];W[hi];B[hk];W[fk];B[mm]MA[eb][ob]
C[At this point I knew I had to start consolidating my position and connect up my stones. Are there some moves I could have done this better?


This move is fine but as you saw later in the game the upper right corner is not completely safe so P18 may be better. E18 is also a big point.]

(;B[od]C[Could I have kept the corner with P18 instead?

I think white can make ko then but the situation is a bit complicated. See variation.]
;W[ob];B[rc];W[qb];B[mb]C[Good move. This point would have been sente for white too.]
;W[nb];B[ne];W[md];B[kf];W[lf]C[This peep at L14 only seemed to strengthen him, not me.

I agree.];B[df];W[cf];B[hg];W[gg]C[Once again. I am strengthening him instead. What should I have done to consolidate and connect?

Now you also strengthen yourself and white can't cut you anymore. I think this is a good way to connect.]
;B[ii]C[This move doesn't make much sense to me. What's your aim? You're not creating or destroying any territory and you loose the option of playing G11 later.]
;W[hj];B[gd];W[he];B[ie];W[hd];B[hc];W[kd]
(;B[ld]C[With this move you lose a liberty. L17 is better.]

C[Good];W[db];B[dd];W[cd];B[gk];W[gj];B[fl]C[These moves in the endgame all seem obvious. Did I miss something? Considerig I only lost by 1.5 points, could I have played it differently to have won?

They may seem obvious but it's not so easy to find the biggest move on the board. You did miss some things and your opponent did too but I think playing the perfect moves from this point till the end is something only a professional could do.]
;W[el];B[fm];W[fn];B[fo];W[en];B[go];W[eo];B[da]MA[hm]C[Nice move but you need to finish the sequence and play H7. See variation for next move.]

(;W[ca];B[ea];W[cb];B[cg]MA[rb][op]C[This is a pretty small move. A few bigger moves are marked X and of course H7 is still the most urgent move.]

You played a nice game. At the end of the opening you were ahead. There were a few mistakes in the endgame. Luckely white didn't take advantage of all of them but I think that's something you can improve.]
