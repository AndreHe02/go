AB[pd][dp]C[CaeZaR:

I'll add specific questions, but please mention any fundamental mistakes you see.  I'll preface my comments with a 'C'.

Thanks in advance.

Hi CaeZaR, 
Here are my comments, I think I got a bit carried away with variations, but hopefully they be of use.  I hope that they can be useful in offering a different perspective on looking at local position and the whole board.]

[lq:B]C[CaeZaR: Any compelling reason to choose 'A' instead [of B\]?

DavidB: Well, I can see lots of other choices as well (labelled).  For me, I would be thinking about R14 (marked).  White ignored this stone after O16, so black could think about punishing here.  

B feels dubious to me, a tight pincer like this will usually start a furious fighting match (or simply an exchange of the corner).


I will offer an exploration of A, C, and another, less aggressive pincer than B.]

(;B[lq]C[Again, this tight pincer should be used with care.  It will start a fight.  Usually, it's used when black wants very much to break white up.  (that is if white had influence around D4 for example).  Here, there is no special reason for a tight pincer.   So don't force a fight like this.]

(;W[pq]C[I don't like this move for white, it gives black too much leverage.]
;B[qq];W[pr];B[qr];W[op];B[po];W[oo]LB[pn:A][lo:C][iq:B]C[C: I wanted to get strong on both sides of this weak group so that I could keep it weak.  But maybe I should have extended to 'A'.

DavidB: Ok, so black chose 'B'.  But 'B' allows white's group to get "out" and thus is not so weak.  Better to have chased it.
'C' looks the most promising to me.]

Me either.];B[eq]C[C: Taking away his eyespace.];W[bq]C[this certainly is complicated, but not good for white I think.  At best, white will get a small corner while black gets thickness to attack the weak white group at Q3 or simply a good size framework.]
;B[fp]C[C: Not sure what his last move was all about.  I ignored it and pressed his undefended stone.

Well, I'm not sure either, except to steal the corner.  your move looks just as valid as]
;W[fr];B[er];W[cr]
(;B[gq]TR[fq][fr]C[C: I think this might be too slow.  I thought it would ensure the death of the triangled stones however.

Pretty slow I think, yes.  these stones are not interesting to white right now, white is still struggling in the corner.  That is a huge area. (see variation for black here)]

See the variation...];W[cl];B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[dq]C[C: I think I need to protect my cutting points after this play.  Any preference as to where?]

(;B[dn]C[this looks like bad shape, but I can't really see a way to exploit it yet as white.]

(;W[dj];B[cc]
(;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf]C[C: A definite overplay.  I should have played the variation.

Over play by whom?  This is a normal exchange for white, making black choose either saving the corner, or making a ponuki on the outside.  I think a good choice for white here, since the side now offers little for either side.]

(;B[cb];W[bd];B[db];W[ee]
(;B[ec]TR[ic][jc][id][jd]C[C: Unnecessary.  A play in the marked area would have been better I think.

I think so too, but...(see variation)
Also, there are bigger moves to make.  Black is more or less stable here, so...]

(;B[bb];W[fe];B[ge];W[gf]
(;B[he];W[hf]LB[if:B][qh:A][ej:D][mo:C]TR[ek]C[C: Suggestions here?  What points are big on the board now?

(black chose D)
E10 is pretty big.  But a pincer against R14 is still waiting. (around A)
also, building this new top moyo is very large (B)
Chasing the weak white group (C)

Which is biggest?  I'm not sure...
Attacking the R14 pincer stone seems pretty certainly large, but this struggle for power along the top doesn't seem over yet to me.  I think black should keep pushing at B.

I'm not sure about D, black has some weakness, and white seems to possess some thickness here, the white cross-cut (marked) in the game led to some problems.]
