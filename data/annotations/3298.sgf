C[Hello.  Thanks so much for the review.  This was an even game where I took white.  I won, but I probably would have lost if not for a lucky break in the endgame.  I have a lot of questions for you interspersed in the game record, but I of course want to know your comments whenever you feel something is worth pointing out.]

TR[eq]C[I have no clear concept of what's correct here.  o3 was a guess.

I think this is good, specialy since the triangle stone is on the 5th line, witch emphasis the lower side]
;B[oq]C[nice of black...
This is usualy not good when there is no black stone to make a pincer...]
;W[np];B[qm];W[jp]C[these last 4 moves seemed better for me than for black.   I'm not sure what to make of r7 since it is not the usual move, so I decided to wait and see.

I think R7 is ok, event if it may make it a bit easier for white to invade the corner... later! You're ritght, it is too early now.]
;B[lp]C[This feels very premature to me.

It is indead.]
(;W[nn]C[I wasn't quite sure how to punish it though.  Was this the right direction?

White have to stay connected. sv];B[ln]C[m3 is still possible at this stage]
;W[nl];B[ll];W[lq]C[linking up seemed like the prudent thing to do.

good! This is the right move.];B[kq];W[kp];B[mq]
(;W[lo]C[It looked like m2 might work, but I wasn't sure.  this seemed good enough.

m2 is the move!!!
sv];B[lr];W[mp];B[nr]
(;W[jq]C[big enough?

White has to connect first, it is urgent.

sv];B[dp]C[strange move to me.]
(;W[ep]C[right direction?

You have to think about the corner first. Here black will get corner and stability now!
sv];B[dq];W[do];B[co];W[cn];B[dn];W[eo];B[bo];W[cm];B[gc];W[bq]
C[slight overplay, i think.

Well... it could work... it's complicated];B[cq]
(;W[er]C[may be B2 is better?

sv];B[br];W[dr];B[bp];W[or]C[I think I misread a squeezing tesuji.  Anyway, it looks like a useless move now.

It's helping black a bit...];B[pr];W[op]C[That move makes black stronger
before this, black still have a weakness in Q3, and there could be a very usefull forced move at R3
after the P4/Q3 exchange there is no weakness anymore, so it is not good for white.
Atari is usually a bad move, it is very tempting to play it since it is forcing the oponent's move, but it usualy reinforce the oponenent......

and m3 is so big!!!];B[pq];W[nj];B[oh];W[fe]C[Okay.  Felt like it was time to play "Where's the biggest move?"  Was I close?

I still prefer M3, since with this move white gets a big moyo at the bottom. 
Your move is big too, but not that urgent

as well, usually E15 is the right shape];B[al];W[bl];B[am];W[an]
;B[bn];W[ak];B[bm];W[ck];B[fg];W[hf]C[h15 better?

no, I think your move is good to attack the black stone];B[lj]
;W[mi];B[li];W[mg];B[lg];W[lh];B[kh];W[mh];B[jg];W[hg]TR[fg]
C[h12 better?

I think so. H13 seems a bit slow, and the black marked stone can escape here]
;B[mo]C[As usual, I wasn't sure, (and I'm still not) how big this ko is.   Was I wrong to let it happen?]
;W[lq];B[no];W[oo];B[mn];W[on];B[lp];W[lf];B[ko]C[:(
now white has all the problems since black is connected
and white is separated, so it becomes hard for white];W[kg]

(;B[ji]C[may be black is a bit shy here

sv];W[jf];B[jo];W[io];B[lc];W[hj]C[big enough? 

It's quite big indead! Good move];B[jr];W[hq];B[in];W[ho];B[hn]

(;W[qc]TR[mg][mh][mi][nj][nl][ol][om]C[When to reduce or when to invade?  I'm never sure, but this seemed overdue.

That may be ok, but white may be able to use his triangle stones more efficiently to invade.

black shouldn't be aloud to capture the white stone!
