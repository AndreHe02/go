;B[pd]C[Hello reviewer,
  This game was played on IGS-Pandanet. Both my opponent and I are rated 19k.
  Here I played black. I won by a narrow margin, but only due to obvious big mistakes by white.
  In this game and several others recently I think I have focused too much on local battles, only to realize too late that I have given up large portions of the board.
  Thank you very much for your advice.

After white's mistakes we were both shoked that I had not won by more, but looking at the board it is clear that I had not done a good job protecting my territory. If it weren't for white's two big mistakes I would certainly have lost.

Thank you again reviewer for your helpful comments!

R: Overall, many good ideas throughout the game.  Biggest thing I noticed was a tendency to attach weak stones when attacking.  Often, it is better to just cut off escape routes.

Watch out for greed.  If you are in the lead, play more defensive.  Make what you have solid.  Become aggressive when you are behind.

Hope this review helps.  If you have any questions, please send me an email.]
