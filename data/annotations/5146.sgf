C[Hello,

I'm playing white here, and had to cope with an opening that I never saw before. In the end, I could not diminuish b's territory enough to win the game.

Thanks to the reviewer in advance!

-----------------------------------

Hello, my name is Kyle Blocher.  I am a ~3k player and I'm happy to review your game for you.  This is my first review for the GTL.  My remarks are made with "KB".

Thanks to you for giving me this opportunity, as well as the GTL for the wonderful environment.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cq];W[dd]C[KB: I did a search on this opening because I haven't played much against the 3-3 point and came up with 18 professional matches in GoBase.org.  White won 12 of 18, probably because the 3-3 point for Black is too slow.  Interestingly enough Go Seigen played this opening in 1933 as Black and won...]
;B[jj]C[KB: This move is absolutely slack by Black.  I would completely avoid playing on Tengen until you have played Go well enough to understand how to use it.  Take advantage of the opportunity Black gives you here.]
;W[dj]TR[cl]LB[qf:A][nc:B]C[KB: Playing on the fourth line means you want influence.  This move plays right into Black's hands since he can undercut your position with his low stone in the bottom left corner later (with the triangled point) and his tengen stone counters influence you could hope to make.  This move would be better played to attack the 4-4 stone at top right from A or B.]
;B[jp]
(;W[pj]C[H: I copied the moyo-oriented style of opening. Good idea?

KB: Counter the influence of his two center stones and use your extension at right to the full advantage now.  See variation.]
;B[jc]C[KB: Black is correct.];W[cn]TR[dj]LB[dp:A][eq:B]C[KB: Approaching this stone at A or B is best in this case - you build influence to work with your marked stone or you establish a base on the side.]
;B[ep];W[en]LB[qf:A][qh:B]C[H: w can be happy with that, right?

KB: Black seems to be ahead of you right now.  Use this stone to finish off the top - it is much bigger than E6.  If Black gets the extension at B, his moyo is perfect.]
;B[gp]C[KB: Way too early.];W[cg]MA[an][bn][em][el][dk][di]
[de][dc][db][da][df][dg][dh]LB[cf:A]C[H: A defensive move, making w loose sente. Mistake?

KB: Speaking from pure efficiency, you are already surrounding 40 points of territory with 4 stones.  Adding a fifth does little to help this.  You should welcome a black invasion at A in this case - see variation.]
;B[qg]LB[qh:A][qf:B]C[KB: Black expands his moyo at the price of yours.  This is the biggest point on the board - although Black should have played at A.

If you got to play at B then your moyo is expanded and you put pressure on the corner Black stone.  Therefore White B is sente.]
;W[ph]LB[lq:A][ir:B]C[KB: The angle play is a local loss for White, because it is too close.  You already have the markes stone, so it is best to leave the situation as is and find a bigger point.  A invites a follow-up play at B which is very bad for Black - therefore A is sente.]
;B[pg];W[ni]LB[oh:A]C[H: bad reading. A would have been better

KB: The shoulderhit only helped Black make an extension from the star point stone at top right.]
;B[qh];W[qi];B[oh];W[pi];B[nq]C[KB: You are right - Black has the better of the right side.  He has good shape while your five stones do not and are too far away from the corner stone.

Black excels at finding good points in the opening.  You should read Otake Hideo's "Opening Theory Made Easy" - it will help you out.]
;W[qn]C[KB: Utilize your wall above and get your corner at the same time.  See variation.]
;B[pr];W[qq];B[fc]C[KB: Now is the perfect time to let Black know you mean business and take his top away from him.]
;W[dc]LB[pc:A]C[KB: Since you already have an extension from the star point with your marked stone, don't add another one!  Don't let Black finish his moyo at top with a move like A or you'll really be in trouble.  See variation.]

[pk][pl][pm][qo][rr][sr][bn][an][em][dk][el][di][dh][dg][df]
[de][db][da]C[H: b has far more potential territory, so w tries to extend his

KB: Let's count.  Black has 42 at the top and 31 at the bottom for 73 points.  Since Black has one more stone on the board, remove 5 points because opening plays are about 5 points each - 68 points total.  White has 40 points on the left and 19 on the right, plus 0.5 komi, for 59.5 points.  You've got 9.5 points to make up for. :/]
;W[mp]C[KB: Great move, right at the junction of two moyos.  This is the proper use of the shoulder hit.]
;B[mq]
(;W[np]C[KB: The continuation could use some work though.  Never ever let your opponent play at the head of two stones.  See variation. Watch for those sente plays! I've marked places on the board where  White should play if Black ignores him.]
;B[lp];W[mn];B[qr];W[rq]TR[lo]LB[kp:A]C[KB: Play at the marked point first - if Black ignores you, you can cut his stones in two with A.]
;B[nd]C[H: w should probably have used the chance of invasion before. Now, this is no option any more, right?

KB: Yes, there is no invasion now. The best White can do now is a reduction.  See variation.]

(;W[nh];B[ng];W[oi];B[og]C[KB: Black shouldn't respond to you.  That stone is not worth keeping at this point.  He should play on the left side to increase his moyo.]

(;W[lh]TR[je]C[H: whites plan: (lightly) attacking b while reducing his potential territory

KB: Do it with the angle play before.  Now you might not be able to pull it off because Black's wall is stronger on the right side.  See variation.

Your best play now to reduce lightly is to cap at the marked point.  See second variation.]
;B[lf];W[jh];B[qd]C[KB: Black is afraid and wastes a move here.  Where is a better play for Black?]
;W[jm]TR[lo]LB[eg:B][jj:A][gn:C]C[H: in retrospect, I don't like this move. The idea was to attack A more severely, but other extensions (e.g. B or C) might have been more profitable.

KB: Stones like there are best attacked on a large scale.  Treat it like it's not even there.  The play at the marked point is still sente and remains open - it makes good shape for your stones.

B and C are also strong moves, also the variation (which makes use of the marked point) is bigger than it looks because of shortage of liberties of the marked stones.]

(;B[gm]
(;W[hl]LB[jj:D][el:A][fl:B][hl:C]C[H: A or B would have extended w's territory. Better than C which is just aimed at capturing D.

KB: The last Black move is an overplay - cut it off and you can capture both it and D.  Going for territory with A or B is small.  See variation.

In general, don't play the angle play unless you're using it for a reduction.]
;B[fm];W[em];B[fk];W[hj]TR[jh]C[H: Big Mistake. Can (and will be) cut.]
;B[ii]
(;W[hi];B[ih]TR[fk][fm][gm]C[KB: If you let him out like this, then the marked stones can be captured with the previous variation.  A better way to capture the tengen stone still exists with your method though.  Go back and see variation.]
;W[hh]TR[eg][eh][fh][gh][ei][fi][gi]LB[fg:A]C[H: whites idea was to use the wall for making territory at the marked points.

KB: This territory is open on both sides, so you have little hope of claiming it.  Moves on the sides and cornersr are bigger.]

[sq][sj][rj][mh][li][lj][ll][am][eh][da][db]C[KB: You're letting Black have his way, and it's costing you points.  You have 36 on the left and 43 on the right (plus 0.5 komi) to make 79.5; Black has 61 on the top and 34 on the bottom to make 95.  Not good for you.]
;B[eb];W[gf];B[ge];W[hf];B[he];W[if]TR[lk][im]C[H: Would there have been a more severe attack than w did in this sequence?

KB: If you blocked Black from escaping on both sides, yes.  Black would have to waste a move or two saving his stones and you could have gotten into his territory.]

[fp:B]C[H: w giving up A and B for getting the corner.

KB: Good.  Black should have blocked you.];B[eo];W[dq];B[fn]
;W[cp]TR[dr]LB[gs:A]C[KB: BIG mistake.  Playing at the marked point kills the corner and sets up the money jump as well.]

[qo][ro][so][ap][bp][op][qp][aq][cq][ar][br][as]C[H: Thanks again for the review!

KB: Your opponent looks to be about two or three stones stronger than you, so I think you played a good game.  You should focus your study on the opening and the endgame, because your opponent really drove you around.  Don't follow your opponent unless you have to!  That will cause you to lose the game every time.

Your sacrifice in the corner at the end was very good and was your best play in this game, followed by your plays against the Black stones in the bottom to create a moyo.  If only you had invaded the Black moyo at the top earlier you probably would have won.  Good luck in your future games!  It was a pleasure reviewing!]
