C[I played Black.

Lin: Hi, I am 2d, and I will try my best to review this game. Thank's for your waiting.]

;B[re];W[ld];B[ep];W[gq];B[er]LB[co:B][cq:A]TR[cp][gq]C[You(Black) may try another joskei that will be better then the game played. Because B25 can neither defense nor attack white marked stone, settled down quickly then assailing with White being good at this situation.]
;W[dn];B[fo];W[ch];B[bf]LB[df:1][cj:A]C[Is it too compliant, to response here. After c9 White get a saver position, than in the Joseki at A.

Lin: You are right. I think that Black may try 1 position for attack both side.]

[qm:B][rm:A][sm:F][rn:D]C[I will try A to G or 1 to 3 for adding ny own moyo at the same time reducing White territory.]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[jc];W[lc];B[jd];W[he];B[kg];W[kq]LB[jp:A]C[How should I response this move? After the following moves up to W70 I felt, that I falled fare behind.

A is a good point to attack White! You can think about this move. White will fail in your down territory.]
;B[kp];W[lp];B[lq];W[lo];B[kr]TR[mp]C[Today I think, I must not give away the marked stone.]
;W[mq];B[lr]LB[ko:B][mr:A]C[I played here, because I don´t want, that White get the point at A, but now White B is sente. What is the better way to play?]
;W[ko];B[jq];W[dq];B[eq];W[go];B[gn]C[I haven´t any better idea, how to response this move.]
;W[ho];B[hn];W[io]TR[ko]C[Now the marked stone stands ideal.
 White is good right now!];B[in];W[jn];B[en]C[This move helps White, to save territory. Is there a better way to play?]
;W[dm];B[cj];W[bj];B[dk];W[cl];B[dj];W[ci];B[fk]C[This was a bad way, to reduce the right side - on top of everything in gote. Is there a better way to reduce/invade, or should I play immediately on the right side?]
;W[qk]
(;B[qi]TR[pl]C[I tought: First take the right side and after that, run away with the marked stone.

This is also a good move that Black can try to abandon marketed stone after you make a good use of this stone.]

(;B[qh];W[lk]LB[ml:A]C[After this move, I regreted, that I ever played the marked stone. I think, it stands too close to the white wall. What do you propose instead of the marked stone?

I think A is OK but R12 is notgood enough.];B[mk];W[lj];B[ll]

I think, White was able to attack me hardly, but he missed some important points for that, like A, B, and C.
However, so I was able to save my weak groups, and after a good endgame, I was able to turn the game to my favour and won with one and a half point.
But I´m not happy, because of my bad early middlegame.

Yes. A is better.];B[nf];W[le];B[kf];W[ok];B[nk];W[ol];B[nm]

I will play 1 to 8 first. because i still hold on the tempo.
I will finish here. sincerely Lin,.];W[dr];B[rb];W[qb];B[qp]
