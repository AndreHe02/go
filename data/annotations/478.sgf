;B[dd]C[I have commented on both b and w moves.  I hope you find this helpful. Let me know if you want more clarification or info on any of my comments.      Jon Zierk]
;W[pp];B[dq];W[pd];B[co];W[fc]LB[jq:a][jp:b][iq:c][qn:d]C[I recommend a,b,or c for W, as it offsets black shimari.  B usually plays d after a or b.]
;B[ec]C[Comment for Black:  Don't kick W,  as you just make him stronger.  This strategy is used to make him heavy for attack,  which is not the case here.]
;W[fd];B[cf];W[jd]C[W has perfect shape at the top... two-stone wall with three-space extension.]
;B[qn]LB[nq:a]C[Recommend approach from the other side at a.  It is a good extension from lower left shimari.]
;W[ql];B[on];W[nq];B[rp];W[qq];B[qj];W[ol];B[pk]C[This peep is very bad for b,  as it weakens group below.  It removes s8 aji for b, and causes other problems to be seen soon.]
;W[pl];B[pg];W[jp];B[lp];W[rq];B[qo];W[nn];B[no]C[You might consider p5 as shown in variation 2.  B gets ponnuki in center, but w connects two groups and gets cash on the right.]

(;W[om]C[p7 is bad shape (empty triangle) and causes b to make good shape (bamboo joint).  Better is n6, which is the standard reply to the b hane.]
;B[oo];W[lm]C[m7 is too easy on b.  n6 is better;  this is still the key point.]
;B[mn];W[mm];B[nm];W[nl];B[ln];W[cj]C[The fight is still going on,  I dont think you can tenuki here.  I recommend k6;  b will live but you can seal him in,  and you should have sente to play on the left afterward.]
;B[gp];W[kq]C[this type of move invites b to split you.  m3 is better,  but I still think k6 is best here.]
;B[lq];W[hq]C[Again,  k6 better.];B[gq];W[jm];B[jn];W[in];B[io]
C[See varition 2... might be better given weakness at bottom.]

C[B is now settled and out... further, w has burden with o8 group.

This result too painful for white.];W[oj];B[ng];W[nd];B[pj]
;W[mj];B[ki];W[lk];B[ll];W[kk];B[jk];W[jj]C[This atari can wait. I think n12 better... make sure you get out,  and keep b separated.]
;B[ik];W[hl];B[hk];W[li]C[I think just l10 is better... in effect,  you traded w m11 for b l12.]

;B[fi];W[ei];B[gg];W[hh];B[gh];W[ff];B[hg]C[W should play h11 immediately.. it is sente and threatens to cut at g11... this should help w to move out faster.]

;W[lc];B[qc]C[r17 is not wise for b, as it just takes risk.  Better to settle q13 group to secure win.]

C[Game is over now... Key problem was allowing b right group to settle while separating w into three weak groups.]
