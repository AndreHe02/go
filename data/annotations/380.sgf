DT[1997-02-10]TM[300]KM[0.5];B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[qn];B[nq]C[NM: While the game is still so open,

I'd be more inclined to play O4; O3 is much more defensive.];W[qk]C[NM: This seems to me too close: I would make the three-space extension to R10.  It's true that that can be cut, but if B tries to cut W can invade the corner.]
;B[de];W[ce]C[NM: This is a joseki which gives W secure territory in the corner; but given the large-scale distribution of stones, and the fact that the BL corner is still open, I would have gone for F16 rather than C15.

But like my previous two comments, these are points which are small and quite subtle, and where I'm by no means sure that all players of my level would agree.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[cj];W[cp];B[ep];W[gq];B[en]C[NM: This (E6) is not joseki, because it fails to keep the W stones separated.

The joseki replies are: C3, F5, or G4 - all of which can lead to complex situations, and maybe should be avoided unless you know the josekis concerned; or E2, which is pretty straightforward, and clearly separates the stones.



I think that in this position I would play either F5 or E2.]
(;W[cn]C[NM: While this is reasonable, my own reaction, given how weak the W stones are, would be to link them by playing E3 (see variation).]
;B[ip]C[NM: A nice attack + extension!];W[jq]C[NM: I would still have played E3 here...

Indeed this play does seem odd, because it invites the separation into two, and in a sense three, weak groups which follows.]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[hr];W[jr];B[hq]
(;W[eq]C[NM: But now of course it doesn't work. I would suggest D3, threatening to link underneath; or G2 (see variation)]
;B[dq];W[cq]C[NM: As can be seen, this sequence doesn't gain W much.  I would play D4.]
;B[fq];W[fp];B[er];W[eo];B[fo];W[do];B[gp];W[lp]C[NM: Too early to save these stones (although the temptation is very understandable).  I would leave them to play a large fuseki point such as R14.]
;B[lr]C[NM: Good answer: it takes territory while attacking, and it's also the eye-stealing tesuji after a B play at K4.]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[np];B[lq];W[mp]
(;B[oq]C[NM: At this point as B I would have taken L4, and reckoned I could live in the corner if W cut at P3.

(see variation for one sequence)



On the other hand P3 secures the corner and keeps W weak, so if B is not sure of living in the corner it's reasonable.]

NM: Good - I wonder whether N7 might be better, as a slightly tighter connection?]
;B[om]
(;W[pl]C[NM: I can see no reason for W not to take P8 now (see variation).]
;B[qo]C[NM: R5 is big because it blocks a W incursion, but W should ignore it.]
;W[rn];B[ro]C[NM: No! This is an endgame move (albeit a big one). B should play O9, or N6, or possibly attack the side group with R11... or even make a fuseki play like K17.]
;W[pf]C[NM: Better than R14!];B[nc]C[NM: At this point, as B I would have played a pincer, such as Q11.  If B replies in the corner, O16 is better than O17 (W can still play R16 to take a chunk of the corner and strengthen himself while doing so).]
;W[jc]C[NM: A big more, but it's much more important to strengthen Q14 first.

I would suggest N14.];B[qh]C[NM: A pincer is good now, though I would play on the fourth line, maybe Q11.



I wonder though whether B could win by  simply taking the corner with R14. If we imagine W R13, B R15, W Q12 and then B moves out from O9 to keep attacking the W K3 group, so preventing W from making territory in the middle, finishing perhaps by taking C8 (or alternatively M17 - the result is very similar), B seems to have good claims on:

BR: 21; BCentre: 13; Rside: 9, TR: 20

while W has:

Lside: 18; BL: 8; TL: 23

so that B is about 4 points ahead (there being no komi), with good prospects to develop his L side and perhaps his lower side.

However, my own inclination would be to go for the pincer!];W[qg];B[ph]
;W[nf];B[qe]C[NM: Only appropriate if B intends to sacrifice his pincer stones.]
;W[qf]C[NM: Bad shape! W should play S13.];B[og];W[of];B[ng]C[NM: Very bad.  B is behind in the race, and this doesn't help to get him ahead.  Much better would besomething like  O9 or O10, or N12.]
;W[nk]C[NM: Good.];B[oj];W[ok];B[pj]C[

NM: Is B trying to live here? It looks decidedly difficult!];W[qj]C[NM: As W now I would lead the Q14 group to safety by playing something like M14. R10 helps to give the W group eye space, and to keep the B group weak by attacking its eye space, but I don't think it's worth taking gote for.

But every player has his own style in running fights....];B[mg];W[mf];B
[lg];W[lf];B[mj];W[lk];B[lj];W[nm]C[NM: Here I would continue the large-scale play with something like M17; but if W feels he needs a play here it should be O8 or N8 not O7.]
;B[ol];W[nj]
(;B[ni]C[M: I think W was lucky that B didn't play Q9 (which is sente, as W must protect his R group against R8); this would have enabled B to split the W groups and leave the lower side one quite weak (see variation).]
;W[nl];B[lc];W[qc]C[NM: It looks to me as if with correct play (see variation) B should manage to kill this stone, but it's not easy.]

(;B[rd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rc];B[re]C[NM: I think I would play Q15 to guard the weakness at R16, while also helping to protect the cutting point at P16.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[sb]C[NM: The W group can't live, so I would cut right away.  If it comes to a ko, then T18 is a   useful ko threat.]
;B[ra];W[qa];B[rb]
(;W[rf]C[NM: Surely W must cut at P16!

(see variation)];B[pe]C[NM: And surely B must protect against the cut!]

NM: This is a conservative move - it might be appropriate if W were clearly ahead, but given that the K3 group is unstable that is where W should play, something like K9, J8, or P5.]
;B[jp];W[kq];B[jm];W[kk];B[dd]C[NM: This move and the next ones up to B16  seem to me a most strange attack. They gain some endgame points, though more would be gained by taking B15 straight after D16 (which is sente if W defends correctly); but while there's still an unstable group that's where the play should concentrate.  Indeed if B doesn't manage to attack it successfully he's clearly lost.



Also as W I would be inclined to let W take the corner (playing say E16, B C17, W C18, B B17, W L10): if in return I can secure my group I've won.]
