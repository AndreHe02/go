C[Dear reviewer,

This review is for white, the game was played on KGS with 30 minutes + 5/30 s for byomi. White won the game by resignation but there was interesting fighting.

I am hoping you can help me with tips on how to use thickness more effectively to attack and give me some hints on making good shape while fighting.

I put some comments to let you know my thinking at certain stages of the game.

Thank you,

Philippe


Hello,

I'll try to give some hints on your game.
However, I think you played it properly, and you made efficient use of your thickness, (moves 50 and 98).

You were less in danger than you though in the center, and black helped you with some blunders, but overall, it was a decent game.]
;B[pd]C[spider8 [8k\]: hi gg];W[dd];B[pp];W[cq];B[dp];W[dq]
;B[cp]C[Mistake I believe by black

Yes, this is a serious misplay];W[ep]C[good];B[bq]LB[eo:A]C[At least, black should play at A]

(;W[iq]C[see variation];B[cr]C[I think this is too early for black.

Yes, this is much too small];W[dr];B[br];W[cj]C[correct];B[cm]
LB[fc:A]C[C8 seemed better for black.

Evenc C8 is the wrong direction
Black group is not in danger.
There is no prospective in C7, particularly against a low stone.

Black should have played at A];W[eo]MA[nc][nq]C[Not sure this was the best move for white?

I'm not convinced.
It protects against a black sente move at E5, but there are bigger moves on the board.]
;B[lq];W[qj]C[correct.
O17 can be played as well.];B[ql];W[qf]
(;B[qe]C[wrong move.
The answer by white justifies R10, so this is not the best move.

Pro games go for R12];W[pf]C[now you have the correct extension (3 spaces in front of 2 stones)]
;B[mc]C[hmm, too far. O17 is joseki];W[fc]MA[ec]C[Again I hesitated before playing this move

It's ok, but E17 is safer for the corner];B[ci];W[ej]C[This is correct. D10 also possible]
;B[dj];W[dk];B[di]
(;W[ei]C[This is possible, but i'd choose to separate (see variation)]
;B[ck];W[dl];B[cl]
(;W[dm]C[White is pushing from behind, but it seemed necessary.

Ok. It seems difficult to close in sente];B[hc]C[I had a difficult time to know how best to make use of my tickness on the left.

Any suggestions would be most welcome.

The idea here is that you want to place any white stone 'behind' black stones facing your wall.

This *can* be very far from you wall.
The idea it to drive the black stones toward your thickness.]

(;W[ko]MA[kp]C[see variation (K17)

Also, invading at R3 is a good possibility, since black has 2 low stones on each side. Becasue of the white wall, there won't be prospective for a moyo.

Last : if your idea is to build territory (usually a bad idea),
L4 is better.];B[jf]MA[bd][jd][po][qq]C[This is a wasted move by black, to me.
- does not secure territory
- does not attack anything

It's a dame point.];W[ji]C[At this stage of the game black has definite territory in the lower left and white some territory in the lower left as well.

It seemed to me that if white could use his thickness well he could win the game.

I would not put it this way :

If white can use his wall to make territorry
(at this stage, the white wall is no more thickness, unless you want to use it against the black stones)]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[bd]MA[mp][ok]C[Perhaps too early in the game for white to play this move.

Yes, too small.];B[gf]MA[ml][oj]C[but black help you. He should play aroud N8]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[re];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[qq]C[good];B[pq];W[qp]

(;W[pr]C[I prefer the variation];B[or];W[qr];B[ro];W[oq];B[nr]
;W[nq];B[mr];W[po];B[op];W[rp];B[np]C[Mistake by black I believe. If black at Q6 instead, I do not know how white can do as well?

Yes, letting white cut is bad];W[pn];B[ps]
(;W[sr]TR[ql]C[S5 is better, because it will make R8 very lonely]
;B[sq];W[sp];B[rr]
(;W[rs]C[S3 simpler];B[ss];W[qs];B[sr];W[rn];B[so];W[os];B[ol]
C[Now white has a good chance to attack these black stones...

Looking back at the game now I realise after the exchange in the lower right that white has a nice lead.]

V1K [8k\]: sorry

The action is at O9.];B[me]C[But black is helping];W[kq]MA[kr]
C[If you want to attack this group, the shape move it at L2]
;B[kr];W[jr];B[ns]C[M1 is the living move];W[qn];B[ks]
(;W[lp]C[I'd go for the weakness in black shape.];B[nk];W[ll]
C[Ugh, I did not like this move but I had to defend my moyo.

Perhaps a peep at N9 earlier in the game would have been better?

At this sage, this is correct. It's the shape move (M9 is usually better).]
;B[hm]C[This has to be a losing move :

If this stone survives, there is little chance that the right black tone do.

Never have 2 weak groups on a board.];W[jl]C[Good];B[gj];W[gi]
MA[gh]C[maybe not touch the stone, you willl strengthen it ...
G12 better];B[fk];W[ek];B[fm]TR[fk][gj][hm]C[This is a very good shape]

;B[jp]C[K6 seemed slightly better for black?

Yes, K6 lives];W[ip];B[jo];W[io];B[kp];W[jq]
(;B[lo]C[Mistake by black, K6 gives 2 eyes I think.

No, see variation.];W[jn]C[game finished.];B[km];W[ln];B[lm]

C[My white group in the middle is not 100% connected.

But I did not want to play to defensively.

My next move was more played to probe my opponent.

You are more connected than you think ...
(see variation next move)];W[jc]

[eg]C[It would have been more prudent for me to connect my white group in the midlle than to push for a few extra endgame points.

This move turned out to be useful in latter fighting but I did not plan it.



Again, you are more connected than you think (see variation), but of course :
"caution first".
particularly when you have a won game

You can always find attacking move that will defend as well ...]

Yes.]
