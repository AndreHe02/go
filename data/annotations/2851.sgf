AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi,

This game was played on Dragon Go Server.  White ended up winning by resignation.  I'd like some pointers on general playing style.

Chris


 Looks good so far :)

(phi) Hi, just a 4 stone Handicap with a difference of 8 Kyu looks bad for black "so far" ;-)]
PL[W];W[fq];B[dn];W[dr];B[cq]C[(phi) good: This is a standard joseki.]
;W[np];B[qq]LB[qn:B][nr:C][pr:A][ms:D]C[(phi) Your move gives you the corner.
I personaly prefer A (to get the corner also) or B.
A gives you the corner also, but puts  some pressure on the white stone: You could play near C or D in the endgame.]
;W[or];B[pm];W[qf];B[nd];W[qk];B[dj]LB[qf:C][ol:B][rm:A]SQ[qk]
C[(phi) The white move (R9) has 3 meanings
a) Destroy your territory (A)
b) Enclose you later on (B) 
c) Make own territorry (together with C)

I would answer on A or B myself.
A: to make territorry
B: to escape to the center.];W[cg];B[df]LB[bd:A][be:E][ce:B]
[cf:C][bi:D]C[Would C14 have been better here?

(phi) I think so. The white stone separates your gropus and has the possibility to expand to D or E.
I would have played A or B to save the corner, but C would have been good as well. C has the drawback, that white will have to answer and will make himself stronger.]
;W[cc]LB[dc:A]C[(phi) Play "A" to 
a) make a wall 
b) put some pressure on the white stone (C17).];B[jd]C[This looked like a big point to take, but I can't help but think I could have played C16 to try and kill White's invasion.

(phi) In situations like this, white is normally alive in the corner. But playing D17 first makes your big point (K16) even bigger.]
;W[gd];B[ec]LB[dc:A][cd:B]C[(phi) I prefer A or B to put some pressure on the white corner.]
;W[cd];B[bi]LB[gb:B][cf:C][ff:E][dg:D][ci:A]SQ[ec][dd][df]C[(phi) Defend on the same line as your oponent.
In this case "A" would be sufficient to secure your teritorry on the left side. 

(phi) I think in this situation the 3 marked black stones are getting weaker and weaker. I would play on B, C, D or E to make the black group stronger.]
;W[rn]C[S8?];B[rm]LB[qk:1][qm:A][rm:3][qn:B][rn:2][pp:C]C[(phi) I dont think that it is possible to separate the two white stones ("1" and "2"). 
I would try to put some pressure on "2" playing "B" or "A". "B" has the advantage to connect loolsely to "C".]
;W[rl];B[sm];W[pn]
(;B[qn]LB[ol:C][om:B][qm:A]C[(phi) Why not simply connect with "A"? After White "B" Black "C" escapes (See variation: White should not resist to capture the black stones.)]
;W[qo];B[qm]C[(phi) seams that your corner is isolated now.]
;W[po]LB[ol:A]C[P9 might be an example of a better place to put a stone.
(phi) I prefer A (P8) because it is more secure. Biut P9 might work as well.]
;B[oo];W[on];B[om]C[The sequence up to here was disastrous for me.  White built a dominating shape from this start.]
;W[no];B[op]LB[op:A]C[(phi) "Your" corner seams lost. So every move played there looses about 6 points in average.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[nm];B[ro];W[rp];B[rq];W[pr];B[sp];W[so];B[oj]
LB[ok:A]SQ[qk][rl][nm]C[Overplay.  Especially considering o7 with r9 and s8.

(phi) Yes: better play A (P9)];W[pk];B[ol];W[ok];B[nl];W[mm]
;B[ml];W[lm];B[pj]LB[mj:A]C[Wrong direction

(phi) I prefer A. It simply connects to your stones and puts some pressure on the white stones.]
;W[nk]LB[in:C][ho:B][io:A]SQ[og][jp]C[P13 is a big move.  Also,  K4?

(phi) P13 would be good. But your black group is still weak (see variation).

K4 is a bit too deep in your oponents teritorry. I prefer A, B or C to escape without trouble.]

(;B[mj];W[mk];B[ll];W[nj];B[lk];W[mi];B[of];W[qh];B[oh]C[(phi) good.]
;W[lj];B[km];W[kn];B[jm];W[qc];B[qd]LB[pc:A]C[(phi) I think "A" makes more teritorry on the top.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[rj];B[oi]LB[pf:B][ph:C][oi:A]SQ[oh][oj][pj]C[At this point I should have built a base along the top.

(phi) Your move at "A" is overconcentrated. The marked stones are connected already. To connect all your stones on the top right, play B or C for example.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[ln]LB[qe:A]C[(phi) Bring it to an end and play A, so whites corner would have been separated.]
;W[jn];B[lo];W[mo];B[lp];W[nq];B[sn];W[sq];B[sr];W[sp];B[qr]
SQ[db][gb][qe][af][cf][jk][cr]C[(phi) The corner has not enough room to make 2 eyes.
So better give the corner to your oponent and play elsewhere (I marked some spots).]
;W[qs];B[mq];W[jp];B[jq];W[iq];B[jr];W[kp];B[kq];W[mr];B[in]
;W[io];B[ho];W[ir];B[ko];W[ip];B[jo];W[dg]LB[cf:A][ef:B]C[G or H12?

(phi) I don't know.
Why not try to separate white playing "A"? Or walk slowly to the center playing "B"? I would have tried something like that otherwise your black stones get very weak.]
;B[gc];W[hc]LB[gb:A][hd:B]C[Instead of cutting on B. I would play A first and try to make eyes.]
;B[hd];W[fc];B[fd];W[gb];B[ge];W[jc];B[gc];W[ic];B[fb];W[mc]
C[This caused a lot of pain.];B[nc]C[(phi) good. 
Now you could go for the white corner (separate using R15).]
;W[kd];B[id];W[ke];B[mb];W[lc]LB[qe:A]C[(phi) Now it would have been the right time to separate the white corner playing at "A".]
;B[lb];W[kb];B[hb]SQ[qe][af][cr]C[(phi) This is not big enough (about 6 Points). You could still separat the corner. 

I marked some bigger points.];W[ib];B[ga];W[qe];B[pc];W[lr]
;B[lq];W[if];B[ld];W[le];B[md];W[kc];B[lf];W[me];B[ne];W[mf]
;B[mh];W[kh];B[lg]LB[ob:D][lg:A][mg:B][nh:C]C[(phi) Instead of A I prefer B or C, because they connect  better. But probably it is now the time to make 2 eyes with D (P18) or a similar move.]
;W[ng];B[og];W[nh];B[ni];W[ob];B[nb]C[(phi) Difficult to make 2 eyes now.]
;W[pb];B[je];W[kf];B[kg];W[jg];B[li];W[mj]SQ[ki]C[(phi) White could have made a "ko" playing on L11.]
;B[ki];W[ji];B[kj];W[jj];B[kk];W[jf];B[hf];W[hg];B[hh];W[hi]

[jg][ng][jh][kh][nh][hi][ji][jj][hk]C[White's group looked very killable if I could keep him from making eyes.

(phi) I think the white group is too big to be killed easily. If white escapes with A, B and/or C, white could probably connect to the left side.

Of course, whenever you make points while attacking: do it!]
;W[gm];B[ij];W[ii];B[hj];W[gj];B[ik];W[il];B[jk];W[gi];B[jl]
;W[gl];B[im];W[ei];B[gg];W[cf];B[ef];W[fh];B[ej];W[eg];B[nf]
LB[nf:A]SQ[ng][nh]C[(phi) A is too small for black. White could simply let you the 4 points. But white does not connect to save the 4 points: White wants to kill your big black group!]
;W[mg];B[oc];W[qb]C[Here I was just looking for an early christmas.  After white escaped to the side, I had pretty much resigned.]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[sl];W[sk];B[ql];W[rk];B[pg];W[rf];C[Result: W+Resign

So there's the ugly truth of it.  I play Jeremy quite often and I realize he's a stronger player than I, but I can't seem to avoid fighting him.  It seems like everytime I play elsewhere, he dives in for the kill.  Any pointers on how to deal with an agressive player would be appreciated.

(phi) You have not expeted to win. But I hope I gave you some useful hints.]
