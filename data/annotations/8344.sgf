C[yelo: hi

s: Hello, I'll be reviewing your game.  I play as samtregar on KGS, at around 3k.  Please feel free to contact me with questions on KGS or by email (sam@tregar.com).  I'll prefix my comments with "s:".]
;B[dd];W[qp];B[dp];W[pc];B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq]C[yelo: time to sleep : )]
;B[np]LB[mp:A]C[mitaniyuki [18k\]: night then

s: This is ok, but A is a bit faster and more flexible.];W[qn]
;B[kq]LB[jq:A]C[s: This is too close.  The basic rule for extending along the third line is extend two from one stone, three from two stones.  You have two stones at O3 and O4 so you can safely extend to A.]
;W[fq];B[hq]LB[dn:A]TR[kq]C[s: To me this seems too close to the marked stone - black has now now played a lot of stones on the lower side and not gotten that much territory for it.  I think I would have preferred a play around A.  If white wants to live small on the bottom, that's ok.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[eq];B[cq];W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[gr];W[fr];B[dm]
LB[co:A]C[s: I imagine it's obvious now, but A is required here.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[ho]
;W[en]C[s: Good move.  Black is in trouble on both sides now.]
;B[dn];W[do];B[fo];W[dl];B[em];W[fm];B[fn];W[el];B[pe]LB[bk:A]
TR[bm][bn][bo][bp][bq][cq]C[s: This is a good move generally, but right now you still need to save the marked stones!  A good rule is urgent then big.  Your move here is big but there are more urgent matters at hand.]
;W[mc]LB[bl:A]C[s: And for the same reason I think A is the obvious move now for white.]
;B[qd];W[qc];B[pj];W[qk]C[s: I like this move - it expands your territory and threatens to invade black at the same time.  Janice Kim (author of some great Go books) says we should always look for dual-use moves like this.  I agree!]
;B[qj];W[pk];B[rk];W[rl];B[rj];W[cf];B[ch]LB[fc:B][fd:A]C[s: This seems like a mistake.  Playing a pincer here so close to white's strong formation is asking for trouble.  I think A or B would have been better here.]
;W[ef];B[fd];W[eh];B[bj];W[bk]LB[bl:A]C[s: A would be more direct here, although I think this is fine.]
;B[ak];W[bl]LB[al:A]C[s: Bad move - A would kill!];B[al];W[am]
C[s: Good - this restricts black to only making one eye on the side.  After playing like this your job is to make sure black can't make a second eye.]
;B[an];W[bi];B[cj];W[ci];B[di];W[bh];B[dh];W[cg];B[ej];W[cd]
LB[gi:B][fj:A][dk:C]C[s: I would press the attack with A or at least chase with B.  Black still isn't completely out of trouble.  Also you can threaten with C and make black give up a potential eye-space in sente.]
;B[cc];W[bd];B[bc];W[de];B[ed];W[fk]LB[fi:A][gi:B]C[s: Wrong side to attack from, I think - this group is super strong so you'd want to push black into it with a move around A or B.  This move pushes black the other way towards your weaker group.]
;B[fj];W[gk];B[gi];W[gn];B[hn];W[fp];B[go];W[eo]LB[ic:A]C[s: Very small - it's way too early in the game to be making moves that are only worth a few points in gote (meaning they give up the initiative, or sente).  A move around A for example would be much bigger.]
;B[gm]C[s: Another very small move.  This is only worth two points and it gives up sente!]
;W[hl];B[jm]C[s: I think it's more important to save your group on the left!]
;W[on];B[mn]C[s: Not an urgent move, but it does enlarge your territory and put pressure on white.]
;W[nk];B[ok];W[ol];B[oj];W[nl];B[ql];W[pl];B[rm];W[qm];B[sl]
;W[ql];B[jc]C[s: Good move - this was the last large open space along an edge, so playing here is big.]
;W[me];B[od];W[oc];B[nd];W[nc];B[md];W[hf]LB[hd:A][ih:B]C[s: Excellent move - looks up at A to possibly reduce and down at B to surround and capture black's big group.]
;B[eg];W[fg];B[dg];W[fh];B[ff];W[df];B[gf];W[hh];B[hg]C[mitaniyuki [18k\]: so exactly what is your rank 4, 5k?]
;W[gh]C[yelo: lol
yelo: you are  kidding];B[ig]C[mitaniyuki [18k\]: maybe 13 or 14k i can guess all night]
;W[ii]C[s: White has won here - the back group can't escape now.]
;B[ih];W[hi];B[he]C[s: Odd move, the white stone looked pretty dead already.]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[ke]LB[kc:A]C[s: I think A would be better - you need to connect to your upper right formation more than  you need to invade.]
;B[le];W[gg]C[s: Another odd move - what does this do?];B[if]
;W[rn];B[ki];W[kk];B[be];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[bg];W[bf];B[dk]
;W[ek];B[gl];W[hm];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[la];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd]
;W[sb];B[sc];W[mi];B[ka];W[mb];B[hk];W[hj];B[ik];W[jj]LB[gj:A]
C[s: This is ok, but it's simpler to just connect to your big group at A.]
;B[gj];W[ji];B[kj];W[jk];B[lk];W[ll];B[kl];W[lj];B[lm];W[ml]
;B[li];W[mh]LB[mj:A][mk:B]C[s: !!! why not connect at A, or capture at B?]
;B[mj];W[nj];B[kg];W[mk]C[s: Whew!];B[lj];W[kh];B[mg];W[ng]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[nh];W[oh];B[oi];W[ni];B[ac];W[ag]C[mitaniyuki [18k\]: that was a reather nice lttile threat]

[lr][is][js][ks][ls]C[mitaniyuki [18k\]: review?
yelo: thx !

s: Overall, this was a well-played game, particularly if you are actually 18K as indicated in white's name.  I suspect that you may be more like 12K or higher, based on this game.  I think studying life-and-death puzzles would be good for both players and would help you learn to spot weak groups like black's left side group faster.  Both players missed opportunities here - white could have killed earlier and easier, and black could have escaped.  Both players showed a good basic grasp of the opening play, so I would focus on fighting skills and tactics.

s: Please feel free to contact me with any questions you might have.]
