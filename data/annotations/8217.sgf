C[M: Hello, this is a game I played on KGS vs Herodote. It turned out to be a very nice game which I really enjoyed.]
;B[qd]C[Herodote [10k\]: hi gg];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qn]C[manckaert [10k\]: Helo
manckaert [10k\]: Have a good game!];W[qq]C[This move is incorrect, when you play the 4-4 you do not do so to immediately react to the approach and take the corner.  The correct move is O3 or O4 if you would like to maintain a stake in the corner (you may also tenuki, or play a pincer, but playing in the corner is an incorrect strategy -- much like P4 would be incorrect over O4).]
;B[rp]C[T4 is incorrect as well, once R3 is played T4 is definitely worth less than other moves, black should instead just play R9 and settle his position.]
;W[np];B[qk];W[dj]C[This move is OK, but it would be better to play on the top because it is 1) more open (R16 is one further from D16) and 2) R16 is an unbalanced corner, so it is considered worth a little more than balanced corners like D4 and D16.  Finally, 3) black playing in that area leads to an ideal shape]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[eq];W[gp]C[G4 might be better at G6 which provides a more dynamic connection]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[fp]C[M: At this point I was beginning to fear for my C4 group. Did I respond correctly or should I have tried getting out instead on keeping on top?

If playing F5 leads to the capture of C4, that's too bad, you must have made a mistake earlier (or ignored moves).  Then maybe F5 itself is a bad move.  However, most of the time F5 is a kind of imperative -- you must try to always block your opponent this way if you can.  So, the biggest thing wrong here is the thinking:

1) F5 cannot be ignored, it's urgent, you can't play a big move before an urgent one
2) You need to practice reading so you may fight with confidence in tactical situations like this]
(;W[fo];B[co]
(;W[do]C[Blocking this way is fine because Black has forgotten to protect the B4 stone. So if he extends with C5 you will eat the B4 stone, and vice versa.]
;B[bn];W[cn];B[bq];W[bm]C[This is overly cautious of your territory, you group remains thick (that is safe and powerful) without eating the stone.  NOW would be a good time to ask "is it good to protect my skirt, or build on the top"?]
;B[ao]C[This black move is a mistake, since it cannot save B6 even if white replies, black ends in gote if he were to follow through, because black will then be in danger of losing his stone as well.  However, none of these stones affect the status of the entire group (black or white's) so they are just stones and can be discarded, that means A5/A6 and A4 are all mistakes they should all be played somewhere bigger.]
;W[an];B[ap];W[oc]C[Excellent.];B[qg]C[Here black should definitely pinch black because he already is low on this side and settled, additionally he has a black stone on the other corner waiting to help his pincher.]
;W[md]C[Higher is often better, but when making a base it is almost always bad to do so low to high.  (but often you will see someone enter in high, then opt to settle by playing low).  Consider M17 instead.]
;B[fc];W[jc]C[Excellent.  Black should have played against your high stone instead, fixing your defect is a good idea.]
;B[cg]C[This is a good move as well because it would be very big for white to play in this area.  Now whit should try to build the bottom, he can do that by starting with Q6 or Q7.]
;W[pe];B[qe]
(;W[pf]C[Usually against a two space extension you play Q13 next now Q15:]
;B[pg];W[og];B[oh];W[ng];B[jq]C[Maybe this would be better at M3, either way black should be prepared to run!!]
;W[kp]C[M: I played this move too fast. I don't think Black responded as he should have. My stones are on the fourth line and maybe he could have gotten under?

Yes playing at M3 would be better.]
(;B[jp];W[kq];B[ko];W[lo]
(;B[ln];W[jo];B[kn];W[mo];B[io]C[Since the ladder doesn't work, it is not a good idea to play this atari.  Consider black's peep at H5 first (see variant).]
;W[jn];B[jm];W[in];B[mn];W[nn];B[nm];W[on];B[om];W[pn];B[pm]
C[White's last two moves are too complacent.  Instead he should hane at P7 instead of P6.  Here he is solidifying his territory but not making anymore, in return black is creating territory and potential terroritory -- consider black playing O12.]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[rq]C[Since black does not need to fix anything, this move is gote, white should play J7, O12 or even M8 before playing a gote end game move.]
(;B[qm];W[im]C[Excellent point.];B[km];W[jr]C[This is not necessary, black cannot connect out, and you already spent several moves (J7 as well as O6 etc.) to strengthen yourself.  The black stones cannot do you any harm now.]
;B[ir];W[iq]C[Instead of cutting, play h2 and eat both stones.]
;B[hr];W[gr]C[This is a mistake, you should eat at J4 and let black take gote if he wants to save the H2 stones.]
;B[gq];W[hs];B[hp];W[ip];B[go]
(;W[ho]C[Atari this way, black can opt to extend at G6 and fight a flower ko, it is better to cap with G6 yourself:]
;B[gp];W[fn]C[No, you must cap, this is like earlier when you asked if you should play F5:  If you can you must.]
;B[gn];W[fm];B[gm];W[gl];B[fr];W[is]C[F2 and J1 are both mistakes, since they do not affect the status of any group, both players should not play them and play elsewhere -- there are bigger things than the capture of a few stones (even if locally it is sente for black to play F2, he does not need to rush to play it -- afterall it is not white's sente so white will be in no rush).]
;B[hc]C[It would be better for black to play O12, etc. and hope to grow the center.  However H17 is big, as well as Q18 and B10 now.]
;W[gd];B[gc]C[Black is strong enough here he can consider fighting with H16.]
;W[hd];B[id];W[ic];B[ie]C[Maybe he is not *that* strong he can fight this way!]
;W[gf];B[ig];W[hf];B[if];W[gh];B[lf];W[ke];B[kf];W[je];B[kh]
C[M: Up untill here I was quite pleased with my game. But my next move...

(Note: My variation is quite long, don't feel obliged to follow it all :-))]
(;W[mh]C[M: I think I was playing too slow and should have tried to get him cut off much more agressively.

Black is probably safe, but at the cost of much of his center territory.  It might be better to just play O12 and reduce the territory directly, and ignore the black group for the moment.]
;B[kj];W[kg];B[jg];W[lg];B[jf]C[This exchange has not cut black but has hurt white's stones (notice that the attacking stones have few liberties, and incidental ones such as L15 have few liberties too).]

(;B[il]C[This is a mistake, black can be cut.]
(;W[hl];B[hk];W[jl];B[kl];W[ik];B[jk]C[M: At this point his stones were connected for sure.]
;W[lk];B[ml];W[lm];B[mm];W[il];B[kk];W[hj]C[Playing this atari is greedy.  It would be better to play G10 to connect with your top tail.]
;B[hi];W[gj];B[gi];W[fi];B[fj];W[gk];B[fh];W[ei];B[gg]C[Playing at F13 would be better for black.
