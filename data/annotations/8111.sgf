C[Hi there,
Thx for reviewing this game. My name is Sven and I played white and for me it was a very interesting close game.
I marked several situations with questions for both sides but if you see big mistakes (no matter for white or black), that I do not cover, please also comment them :)

There are 10 positions in the game with questions, last position on move 100.

So thx again for your effort on reviewing this game.

Hagios: Hello,
This game was nice for white overall.  You made some elementary mistakes as did black, which I will attempt to cover in as great detail as I can.  I will warn, however, against reviewing wins.  You want to make sure the games you focus on are losses where you don't understand where you went wrong.  Here, even when you made mistakes the game favored you.  This makes reviewing the game less helpful than if you were looking at a loss.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[cn]LB[fq:A]C[H: I don't prefer this way to play.  As black here I would prefer the approach at A.  Black's approach is at the wider side, but the approach at A is able to better work with the rest of black's stones.]
;W[dk]C[H: When you pick such a move, you must have a long term plan.  As black, I'd immediately play the second approach.]
(;B[cq]C[1. question:
Is the joseki that is choosen here from both sides ok? Or would a double pincer on f3/f4 better for black or maybe running out at e6?

H: I'm not sure I agree with either player's choice.  Black plays to simplify here, though, which I cannot say is 100% bad, but isn't the optimal result, I believe.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq]LB[dn:A][fp:B]
C[2. question:
I think the following moves of white are a bit stupid.
The intention was to push black a bit further on the bottom side to minimize the aji of c6 and then finish the sequence with c14.
But I missed that goal, so the question here:
Does white should directly play c14? Or is something like e6 necessary (seems a bit overconcentrated)?

H: The thing you must realize about pincers that result in your opponent taking the corner like this, is that the further away your attacking stone is, the higher the danger of your opponent activating their stone and attacking you severely.  A move at A can be called honte in this case, as your opponent might have some attacking chances later, and pushing around B helps black more than white.]
(;W[eq]C[H: This is aji keshi.  Please consider the variation from the previous move.]
;B[er];W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[de]C[H: This is a bit greedy.  Black must recognize that this is white's sphere of influence.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[ed]LB[dk:A]C[3. question:
I've choosen this joseki to get the corner safe and press black against the wall...the following result wasn't a real sucess...
the pincer is probably better

H: This is perfect.  The black group is already pincered at A!]
;B[cj]
(;W[ic]C[H: This move takes the pressure off of black, letting him resolve the situation nicely.  In a position where you have good attacking chances, you should avoid backing off.]
;B[ck];W[ch]C[4. question:
Here I thought I can cut the black groups but I think this cannot work. Neither like in the game nor with the variation.
But I have not  real good idea  where I should play next...instead of c12 which points are of interest for white?

H: You cannot cut the black groups unless black allows you.  You can take away his territory, though, which you do here.]
(;B[dh];W[bf];B[cg];W[bg];B[ci];W[bh];B[ei];W[dl];B[cl]
(;W[dj];B[di];W[gk];B[dm];W[em];B[en];W[fm];B[fn];W[gn]C[H: This was probably necessary, but white has to accept throwing away three stones.]
;B[gm];W[hm]C[5. question:
Mistake of mine (the sequence) but black missed to cut (variation).
But I felt that g9 is necessary...]
(;B[el];W[fl];B[ek];W[hp];B[hq];W[pn]C[6. question:
Here's also the question where I can go on...
The idea was to get an area on the right side and maybe to create a moyo between q6 and h7, as the game shows this plan worked not really good( see move 78) , so the concrete question is: is q6 the wrong side? would it be better to play something like o4?
And the second question: Where should I play instead of q6 overall? are there better points then to attack the lower right?

H: I don't see a way you can form a moyo.  A moyo without an edge to make use of are hard to defend.  This sequence is normally very good for black, since he gets an extra line of territory versus the normal joseki, played with a komoku stone (see variation).]
(;B[qn];W[qm];B[qo];W[pm];B[nq];W[qi]C[H: Here, you can see that black got a lot more than you would want to give him.]
;B[qg];W[oi]
(;B[kc]LB[gc:A]C[7. question:
Question for black: Was this move good? or would it be better to secure the corner and let white play the extention on the upper side (see variation move 64)?

H: That's a difficult question.  Black's upper side has a few defects, and it would be hard to fix them all in a single move.  I like this move because it aims clearly at A, so white MUST be careful about ending an invasion sente.]

[hp][lp]C[Now here can be seen my evil master plan^^, that is mentioned in question x on move y

H: I notice you put the square on k12.  This is a bit of hopeful thinking.  You have to imagine a perfectly straight line between your border points.

The triangle points are your line.  Black should play somewhere on this line to reduce you with maximum efficiency.  Furthermore, the points at o5 and p5 are glaring defects in the moyo.  Black can jump in to those points to whittle away your points.]
;B[ji]LB[gc:B][kd:A]C[8. question:
This was a very good move of black I dont know how to react...
Only defensive with l10 maybe? or aggressive trying to surround and capture k11? ( in the game I choose the aggressive one but changed very soon my opinion)

H: This is a good move by black.  He could have been even more aggressive if he wanted, and jump further.  He has enough support.  There's no way to attack this stone well, so white has a hard time forming a good plan.

In a case like this, you *must follow your instincts.*  Going against them won't help you win games.  This is not a tsumego, so you will have to figure the position out.  Personally, if I wanted to attack the stone, I'd start at A with a leaning attack.  It also helps solidify the weakness at B.]
(;W[ke]C[H: This is the right idea, but it leaves behind a good point for black to strike.]
;B[jd];W[je];B[id];W[hc];B[gi]C[H: Now you can see the danger of allowing gote.]
;W[np];B[mq];W[ij];B[ii];W[jj];B[kj];W[ki];B[hj];W[hk];B[kk]
C[9. question:
Are there other possibilities for black or must black try to life here with the l9 group?]
;W[jl];B[kl]
(;W[li];B[jm];W[il]LB[li:A][jm:B]C[10. question:
The following sequence is very bad for white, maybe you see a way how white can do better?


-------------------------------------------
From my side there are no questions left. The following moves are clear for me with small and some bigger mistakes on both sides but these are clear mistakes with no need of further explanation.
So thx for reviewing! Best wishes Sven

H: White didn't need to defend at A.  White should have attacked at B.  There is one more chance I'll point out later.]

A few of the moves you made felt a little hasty.  I think if you stepped back and considered each of your moves for just a few more moments, you'd show a lot of improvement quickly.  j19 is the perfect example--you knew before the sequence was played out, how it would end.  If you looked at it before your opponent pushed through at g17, you would have easily avoided it, instead of saving your 2 point stone.

I hope this review is helpful, if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me on KGS (id: Hagios)]
