;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[cj]LB[jc:a][jd:b]C[I like this opening. Do you know wheher this is a known fuseki, or on the other whether it has some drawbacks?
JH : As I know, it is not played often as it lets White occupy "a" which prevents to begin a moyo with the sanrensei at "b". It is always interesting to try new ideas anyway.]
;W[jd]C[JH : Good];B[jq];W[jj]C[How about this move? I felt a bit grateful for W playing it.
JH : It is always difficult to play in the center as there is a risk to play a dame move. However, it is a plus for shicho as many of them will be good for white and for influence]
;B[qj]C[This fuseki deserves the name Daimler-Crysler (the Crysler logo head down) :-)]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb]TR[jd]C[White should not play this keima when there is already the delta stone as after black defends, he has to put one more stone which is too slow.]
;B[qc];W[qb]C[JH : Too early];B[oj]LB[qm:a][hc:b]C[strong players seem to prefer s18, I thought that this move is advantagerous, as it stabilizes the
upper half (especially if W plays s17) and prepares for action at the right side. Is this correct?

I never see such plays in >1d IGS games.
JH : S18 is too conservative. Your move is not bad, but a bit slow. Why not "a" or "b"]
;W[rc]C[White plays too many moves here.];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd]
;W[od]LB[qn:a][fc:b]C[I felt like this move is too slow. What are good moves for W.  I would play any of n3 (Bg3, Wc6?),
g3 (Bo3, Wr6?), or g17. I don't know which if any is the best move. Any advice?
JH : I feel too that white is overconcentrated on this corner. I recommand "a" or "b". "a" look good as it is a good move for Black.]
;B[qn];W[qo]C[JH : Bad. Do not play the kosumi-tsuke when it is ideal for your opponent.]
;B[pn];W[oq]LB[nq:a]C[Strange. Genrally at "a"];B[cn]C[I expected Wf/g3 here and thought that after Bn3 I'ld get out of this sequence in sente to play g17.]
;W[cl]C[JH : OK];B[fq];W[eq]LB[eo:a][dn:b]C[JH : White should just play at "a" or "b". White plays too many kosumi-tsuke. It must be played as an attacking move but he used it for defense and it lets weakness in its shape at the 3-3 point]
;B[fp]C[I felt comfortable with all this...];W[co];B[cm]LB[dn:a]
C[JH : Possible, but playing at "a" is good too];W[ck];B[dj]
;W[cq]LB[el:a]C[JH : White should jump at "a"];B[el]C[This move is probably to unpatient. I probably should have better played at say e or f6 to connect.

I thought I could catch C8 somehow this way (at least get a strong position).

JH e6 is good also but this move is quite strong];W[dm]LB[fc:a]
C[White should not move. His two stones have aji. Play elsewhere like "a"]
;B[dn];W[em];B[en]C[I think I was getting afraid now. Better cut at d8, right?
JH : the cut seems better but white is very bad.];W[dl];B[fm]
;W[ek];B[fl];W[dk]C[White shape is horrible.];B[ej]LB[fj:a]
[fi:b][gj:c]TR[dj][fl]C[This move is bad.
In this shape, you should remember that the good shapes are not at "a" but at "b" or "c". Please remember the way to defend against the cut od the hazama tobi : shape of the delta stones]
;W[fk];B[fj]C[JH : still bad as you oblige your opponent to play a good move.]
;W[gk]C[White is happy to play here];B[gc]C[Is this move ok? I thought of d14 as alternative. Stronger players seem to play more conservatively at f.g. c14?
JH : Your move is better. C14 is too conservative.];W[df]LB[ff:a]
C[JH : Greedy. White will have a hard time when capped at "a"]
;B[ce]C[JH : The wrong direction];W[ch]LB[ff:a][ge:b]C[Is this good? I was surpised by this move
JH : Not good as it lets black cap at "a".  White should have played at "b"]
;B[bj]C[JH : Wrong. Black should play above white.];W[bl]C[JH : This is worse. White wants to attack Black but his stones are too weak.]
;B[ff]C[JH : Good];W[ee];B[ed]LB[ge:a]C[JH : Again the hazama tobi. Black should attack White on the outside. Why not "a"]
;W[fe];B[cf];W[dh];B[cg];W[dg];B[bh];W[ge]C[JH : White is happy to play this move. But Black has still a big territory.]
;B[jb]C[probably nonsense, I guess n3 would have been better?
JH : Right. This move is a bit small but not that much.];W[kc]
;B[kb];W[kq]LB[kp:a]C[good W move, right? I think i cannot play at one of m3, n3, l4 because my group around f4 and above has several weak points, so I decided to let white have some profit and play safe. Is this to passive in this situation?
JH : I feel it is a bit passive. White move is strange and Black can answer at "a"]
;B[jp];W[kp];B[jo]LB[ko:a]C[Black is ahead, so his moves are OK. In fact he can play at the head of the two stones at "a".]
;W[ko];B[jr];W[kr];B[ro];W[rp];B[po];W[qp];B[no];W[pi]C[I think i've got some luck in the sequence following this move
JH : this move is an overplay, but white must do something as he is late in the game.]
;B[oi];W[oh];B[ph];W[pg];B[qh];W[qg];B[og]
(;W[nh]C[White should sacrifice this stone and try to get the corner playing the variation.]
;B[rg]C[I don't know if this was W initial plan (to start building a center territory, but I felt like the are was still open enough to secure the right side. On the other hand I remember beeing ripped of territory by such an invasion. Could W have played better here? (B?)
JH : Black is too happy to play like this. White has playes almost nothing.]
;W[ng];B[of];W[nf];B[gj];W[hj];B[id];W[ie];B[jc];W[kd];B[hd]
;W[he];B[hi];W[ij]C[Again I felt comfortable. At this stage I had the feeling I'm ahead quite a lot. Most games I play now, while having this feeling end up with about 2-6pts wins. But doesn't this one look like more? What am I doing wrong?

JH : Black is ahead.];B[ih]C[JH : Good . White will not do a lot in the center]
;W[gh];B[gi];W[jg];B[jh];W[kh];B[ki];W[lh];B[li]LB[rn:a]C[JH : This is not bad as there is some potential against White dragon but simply connecting at "a" is very big]
;W[jn];B[in];W[im];B[hm]C[I think here H6 is better?

JH : Simply play H6 is good enough.];W[hn];B[io];W[gm];B[fn]
;W[hl];B[kn]LB[er:a]C[JH : Black should simply defend at "a"]
;W[jm];B[mn]C[JH : Not so good.];W[ln];B[mq];W[nr]LB[mr:a][mp:b]
C[White should play at  "b" to connect at "a" later];B[lo];W[km]
;B[ks];W[go];B[ep];W[er];B[lr]LB[fr:a]C[JH : Defending at "a" is better]
;W[hq];B[gp];W[hp]LB[gr:a]C[Why not simply play at "a"];B[ho]
;W[gn]LB[gr:a]C[JH : No need to connect the white stone. Play at "a"]
;B[gr]C[JH : Black is lucky to capture 2 stones.];W[hr];B[hs]
;W[cc]C[Hmm... that was a bit bitter. I felt like the edge was mine.
JH : Yes, White will die if Black plays well.];B[dc];W[bd];B[bb]
LB[cb:a]C[JH : Playing simply at "a" kills also.];W[cb];B[db]
;W[ba];B[ab];W[be];B[cd]C[JH : Let white live. You can suspect this is a bad move as you connect a kosumi.]
;W[ac]C[JH :Good move. Black has lost 25 points here];B[bf]
;W[ae];B[da]C[JH : This is not sente];W[bc]C[JH : No need to answer. If white took sente here , he may win.]
;B[bo]C[JH : very big as it prevent white to connect his group.]
;W[bp];B[do];W[cp];B[gl];W[bn];B[fo];W[hm];B[bm];W[ao];B[al]
;W[ak]C[JH : White should play for eyes in the center. No need to play here]
;B[am];W[bk];B[lm]LB[ll:a]C[JH Not the best ; what about "a"]
;W[ll];B[mm];W[kj]LB[lj:a]C[Could I have killed W, perhaps with M10?
My original plan was to get L3 ff. That I got.
JH : White is not clearly alive. Black should play at "a"];B[kn]
;W[lj];B[ln];W[mi];B[ji];W[nk];B[ok];W[nl];B[om]LB[rn:a]C[JH : this is smaller than "a"]
;W[rn]C[JH : White took the good point];B[rm];W[so];B[mb];W[rl]
C[that hurt a bit...];B[sm];W[pl];B[ql];W[ol];B[qk]LB[pk:a]
C[JH : better at "a"];W[nm];B[ml];W[mk];B[nn];W[pm];B[qm];W[np]
LB[rb:a]C[JH : small ; play at "a"];B[mp];W[mr]LB[rb:a]C[JH :A mistake, this move is very small. Connecting at "a" is large]
;B[nq];W[mc]LB[ig:a]C[JH : bigger at "a"];B[ig];W[jf];B[fh]
;W[gg];B[fg];W[gf];B[rb];W[ra];B[sb];W[nb];B[lb];W[oe];B[pe]

;B[on];W[qa];B[ni];W[sa];B[sc];C[JH : Black had a better game in the beginning. In spite of a big mistake in the upper left corner, he still had the lead.]
