C[Hi, I played this game as White.
I am very puzzled because in the opening I felt I had a good position, but at the end of the game I felt behind, and I do not understand where things turned for the worse. Was it a strategy flaw (e.g. wrong direction)? Or a tactical mistake (e.g. atari where I shouldn't, or I just missed the correct point in a sequence)?
I would be very happy to receive the opinion of a stronger player.

Hagios: Hi, I'll be reviewing your game.  I hope that I'll be able to help you find a few areas to focus on in your play. :)]

(;B[kq]C[H: This was a weird move.  White's stone will be well placed after the fight in the corner.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]
(;W[nn]LB[rn:A]C[I was happy with this position. Or I shouldn't be?

H: I would prefer to connect solidly.  Right now black A is annoying.]
;B[nq]C[H: Black plays for territory, but played a pincer at A.  The lack of a clear goal hurts black overall.]
;W[mq];B[gp]C[H: Black has a lot of weakness here.  It's better to approach the corner from the other side and aim to make white overconcentrated.]

(;W[pp]C[H: This move doesn't hurt black--it could have been a ko threat later.]
;B[qr];W[rn]LB[pn:A][iq:B]C[Was this too slow? Was better to cap at L5, or play inside the black stones around J3 or J4? I played here aiming at splitting the right side with a play around Q12 in the next moves.

I am not sure if I can kill the corner but I was not happy at the idea of letting black crawl with a play at S6.

H: You could have avoided needing this move by connecting at A earlier.  I would like to attack at B right now.]

(;W[ok]C[Good point to take?

H: This gives black a target; black must be happy.];B[nm]C[H: This is a perfect move to put pressure on the white stone.]
;W[mm];B[pk]
(;W[pg]LB[nc:A][eq:B]C[I was happy with this move (splitting the right side), but is it good?

H: This move runs the risk of creating a group with no base near black strength.  I would be scared to do this as white--why not approach from A, or add strength around B?]
;B[ml];W[lm];B[on];W[no];B[lo]
(;W[kr]LB[jq:A][jr:B]C[First strategic choice: let black cut, and fight it out.

I was counting on A and B miai (if Black takes A white B, and vice versa). So I thought my group could easily live even if cut (second eye around T7).

H: Cut first, think later.

Allowing black to cut, ending up creating a weak group to chase is painful for white.  Even though it creates a bad shape, avoiding connecting isn't an option here.]
;B[mn]LB[jq:A]C[H: The game is very difficult for white, now.

At this point white must counterattack somehow.  A is a reasonable candidate.]

(;W[nl]C[With hindsight, was perhaps simple jump at K7 better?
P9 already takes the vital point of black shape, so maybe O8 is bad.

H: This move doesn't help white at all.];B[nk]
(;W[ll]LB[nl:A]C[I'm afraid that this is a bad move... is it?
My plan was to play P10 somehow and leave black shape with a false eye at O8, but I was afraid of handling badly M7 stones as in the variation-

H: This move would have been fine without adding the stone at A.]
;B[ol]C[... and now I suddenly thought pulling P9 out with a stone at P10 was not so good anymore. Bad choice?]

(;W[jq]C[Also this is probably mistake- crawling under only made black stronger. M8 became weaker. And also Q13 lost a lot of power.

Could you point me to some alternatives?

H: I recommended this earlier.  I think this is a fine move for the local area.  Any other move would be tenuki.]
;B[jp];W[iq];B[ip];W[hq];B[gq];W[hp];B[ho];W[go]C[H: You have to be careful when cutting so close to weak stones.]
;B[fo];W[gn]C[White made a poor choice when crawling at K3, but black let this cut and it's better for White, correct?

H: Black might be able to attack the corner if white isn't careful.  This is risky from white overall.]
;B[hn];W[fp];B[gr]
(;W[hr];B[ep];W[fq];B[eq];W[fr];B[er];W[gs];B[do]LB[nd:A][cf:B]
C[Now I was looking to defend the M8 stones to attack the L5 string of stones, and later resume the attack on P8 group

H: White gains 6 points and loses the corner in compensation.  This is difficult to accept.

White must now try to take big points to stay in the game.  A and B are candidates.]

(;W[jl]C[Aiming at K7];B[im]
(;W[jn]LB[nd:A]C[This was at the end tactically bad?

I thought I could choose from 3 strategies:
1. Atari at N6, which would probably result in black leaving N6 and running out with the rest of the group with something like H7. The idea is that N8 group becomes connected with the strong group at the bottom. I did not like this choice.
2. Hit the vital point K6 (my choice in the game) and either cut the J4 tail of 6 stones, or be in a good position to chase the whole group if black defend the cut (J5 false eye now)
3. Run out with N8 group (with something like L11) and more or less let black decide if defending J7 group or O9 group

In a situation like this, what is the best choice?

H: White's group is in a difficult position.  If you aren't certain that you can kill this black group, it's better not to add stones to the current situation.  I'd consider A instead.]
;B[jm];W[kn];B[il];W[io]C[I had mistakenly read I could cut unconditionally...]

;B[lk];W[kk];B[jk]C[H: White cannot win this ko.];W[lj];B[mk]
;W[jj];B[kl]C[I thought it would work for white, but I misread...

H: Disasterous for white...];W[rq];B[kj];W[rr]C[So now W killed corner, but in gote. Points look about equal. But now Black thick and sente. This is already a good position for black?

H: Black's strength is bigger than losing the corner.  White is in a dire position.]
;B[fn]
(;W[nc]C[Double approach seemed like a good way to go, but perhaps a high stone (O16) was better?

Or it was better to just pull out the Q13 stone, like in the var?]
;B[nd]LB[md:A]C[H: It's difficult to figure out how to play now, since the Q13 stone can't easily make a base.  White wants to play at A, but doing so weakens the other side.]

(;W[oe]C[H: This move gives away a lot.];B[oc];W[md];B[nb];W[ne]
LB[pg:A]C[This is a good result for white?
Was there a better variation for the corner?

H: The problems in the corner started at A.];B[qg];W[di]C[Was it better to play in the lower left corner first? Or the game is already lost for white here?]
;B[dk];W[co]C[H: This is very hard for white.];B[cn];W[dn];B[eo]
;W[gm];B[fk];W[ck];B[dm];W[bn];B[cm];W[bm];B[bo];W[cp]C[This was to leave more aji in the corner. Is it a correct idea?

H: Black won't spend a move immediately to capture 1 stone.  This was a ko threat.]
;B[bp];W[cl];B[dl];W[cf];B[cj];W[bj]C[Was crawling like this bad for white or is the best that white can do in this situation?

H: By this point, this was the best white could do to live.]
;B[dj];W[ci];B[ei];W[bh];B[lc];W[mb];B[mc];W[ob];B[nd]C[With hindsight, I see that white cannot win any KO, because of the lower right corner - black has endless threats, so it was a bad idea to start it

H: This is correct.];W[bq];B[cq];W[nc];B[rp];W[qq];B[nd];W[kf]
;B[nc]
(;W[ph]C[Perhaps wrongly - was it better in the variation?]
;B[me];W[mf];B[le];W[ki];B[ij];W[kk];B[jo];W[kd]C[Another wrong move - I should just connect at M14 here.

Anyway the situation looks bad for white now: as per territory (black is ahead), as per thickness (black is ahead).

This is the last comment.];B[lf]C[darkronin [4k\]: Day, thx
Jara [3k\]: thx
Jara [3k\]: did u play via mobil?
darkronin [4k\]: Yes
darkronin [4k\]: Bit laggy
Jara [3k\]: its more dificult
Jara [3k\]: good bye
darkronin [4k\]: Bye

H: Overall, white ended up playing far too focused in all of the engagements.  Several times, a tenuki would have ended with white having a better overall board position.

I recommend studying opening strategy further, particularly with whole-board joseki.  In particular, you might find the book, "The Great Joseki Debates" useful.]
