C[Hello I used to play go a lot but now just getting back into it and any advice to improvement would help.

Hi, hope you will find my comments helpful. I'm Andre and 2K in Germany. Comments are marked with AB.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]C[mosco: hi];W[dc];B[ce];W[de];B[df];W[ee]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[pj]C[How is this move... didn't feel like I would help myself at all in the uppe left corner by pushing the fight... thought it would just help him make secue shape so I decided to play elsewhere.  Is that okay or did I miss a better attack move to keep the pressure on in the upper left corner

AB: Well, there is not much to attack for you in the upper left. Four white stones against three black ones and noone made a big mistake there, so there is no attack for Black. Just an extension on the left would be normal and probably more valuable than the move you played, which of course is big as well.]
;W[cj]LB[dh:a]C[I sort of expected something like this but that was the price for playing the san ren sei but now I get to respond and help settle my group

AB: You can count yourself a little lucky here, I think a White move at D12 would be much more severe. Now at least you can still settle your group relatively easily with C12.]
;B[ch]C[AB: Good.];W[gc]C[AB: A little bizarre, F17 would be normal.]
;B[fq]C[Okay now I like the way things are going since white looks way to concentrated in the upper left corner

AB: No, White is not concentrated in the upper left, quite the opposite. Your group is squeezed there but that is the price for the san-ren-sei. F3 is very good, overall Black's position is good.]
;W[fp]LB[dn:a]C[AB: I would have played the "normal" move D6 without hesitation as it helps White C10 stone as well. The attach-and-extend joseki is rarely seen in even games, more in handicap games. Strange that White plays is twice in a row now.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[gq]LB[eq:a]C[I don't think this was a good move?

AB: Correct, this move is bad. Simply because E3 is such a great point for White. You should play there yourself, D3 is also possible.]
;W[eq]C[AB: Now it is obvious that the sequence is good for White. White has a strong group plus points and Black has three heavy stones that still need to be looked after.]
;B[lp]LB[kp:a]C[Now after the game is over I would have made that move one more space to the left, but at the time I liked the shape

AB: Yes, L4 is much better, one line can make a big difference.]
;W[qj]LB[qn:a]C[Never really expected an attack like this, haven't seen this much, not sure if I repsonded right

AB: That is a little strange move. White seems to play a lot of handicap games. First the attach-and-extend joseki, now a typical White nine-stone-handicap approach. I think a normal approach at R6 is quite good.]
;B[qk]C[AB: Hane is correct.];W[pk];B[ql];W[qi];B[oj];W[qf]
;B[qd];W[oh];B[mc]C[He got some space  to live but I think I get more

AB: Altogether Black handled the situation quite well. White has not achieved much.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[AB: Good direction.];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn]
;B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rs]TR[lp]C[AB: Now it is obvious that the M4 stone would be much better placed at L4. From both sides this stone is badly placed.]
;B[cl]LB[hn:a]C[AB: Not sure this is such a good idea. The Black group in the upper left is weak. Maybe H6 would be a good idea to increase the size of the moyo and protect some of the weaknesses. Black would be ahead.]
;W[ej]LB[dk:a]C[AB: Better at D9...]
(;B[el]C[AB:... because Black can (and should) connect underneath. See variations.]
;W[jp]TR[fq][gp][gq]C[Now I really wish the three marked stones on the bottom left were not so isolated... this could cost me some

AB: And it should :-). Mistakes must be punished, this is the only way to learn.]
;B[go];W[jn]LB[fn:a][fm:b]C[AB: Not good. White is too afraid here. The one stone at K4 is light and can even be sacrificed. White should answer the Black move at F6 or better even at F7. This will cut Black and put the two stones on the left under pressure. With two weak groups on the left alone the game will become difficult for Black.]
;B[fn];W[dn];B[en];W[eo];B[dm]LB[gl:a]C[AB: Not sure about this one, White could ignore it. Simply G8 improves Black's overall position and protects the G6-cut as well. The game will be difficult for White.]
;W[cn];B[ef]LB[jl:a]C[not sure if this was the right move here... wanted to block that point to attack the two stones in the middle?

AB: Not sure that this is the best possible idea. White can always let go of the C10 stone in the worst case. How about a clear attack on the two stones at K8?]
;W[gj]C[AB: Overall I think White has gained from the E14-G10 exchange. The cut at G6 becomes more of a problem now.]
;B[ln]LB[jl:a]C[again not really sure if this was a good move or not

AB: I think the cap at K8 is better direction, but I may be wrong. For me the territory you get there with M6 is too small. It reinforces the M4 mistake if you want to see it that way. If White plays M6 after Black K8 Black still gets the points to the fourth line, so the gain by M6 is not much. On the other hand, Black would have a much more active game in the center.]
;W[jl]C[AB: Now basically White is more or less out of trouble.]
;B[jc]C[AB: Greedy. The cut at G6 is now a serious problem. The complete Black group already does not look so great, but cut in two it will be difficult.]
;W[hn]C[AB: The worst move ever! If you ever read about Thank-you-moves, this is the blueprint here! All along I have been talking about the cut at G6. Well, if you are afraid to play at G6, at least do not rob yourself of the opportunity to play it.]
;B[gn]C[AB: Thank you very much. Now Black is out of trouble.]
;W[jr];B[lr];W[lm];B[mm];W[ll];B[ml]LB[kn:a]C[AB: Just like in the attach-and-extend joseki L6 is the shape point.]
;W[kj];B[lk];W[kk];B[km]C[AB: It is unnecessary to fix the shape now.]
;W[kl];B[kn];W[jm];B[hm];W[ho];B[hk];W[hj];B[gk];W[fk];B[fl]
;W[ik];B[ek];W[fj];B[dj]LB[bj:a]C[AB: I think the connection at B10 still works.]
;W[di];B[dk];W[ci]C[AB: Now of course the result is bad for Black and the group in the upper left now somewhat in trouble.]
;B[ei]C[AB: Does this work?];W[eh];B[fi];W[gh]C[AB: Didn't think so.]
;B[dh]C[So all of that clearly was not the way to go about it... my efforts were intended to build up my shape, solidify my positions while attacking white, but I just conected his groups and gave him a great opportunity to attack my stones?

AB: Well, it was still White who made the worst mistake. The trouble for Black would have been far greater had White cut you in two in the bottom left. Overall the game is still good for Black it seems as the group in the upper left is not going to die.]
;W[fh];B[fe];W[fd];B[bc]C[AB: Good and important.];W[bb];B[bd]
;W[ge];B[bi];W[bj];B[bg];W[bk]LB[ai:a]C[AB: Bad. Atari at A11 is normal.]
;B[bl]C[AB: Now Black can jump to A5.];W[kd]C[AB: It's difficult to come up with something for White now.]
;B[kc];W[ai];B[bh];W[ld];B[lc];W[re];B[of]C[AB: Black should answer White's move here.]
;W[rd]LB[rc:a]C[AB: Why not jump to S17? That is really big and could seriously turn around the game.]
;B[rc];W[pg];B[md]LB[ie:a][ao:b]C[AB: Is there not something more active, such as J15 to attack the two stones? The Black move seems slow. A large endgame move, such as A5 would also be better.]
;W[jd];B[hb]C[AB: Good.];W[hc];B[ib];W[ic];B[hp]C[AB: What is the purpose of this? Black is alive.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[jq];B[ir];W[li]C[AB: The idea is not bad, though it will be difficult to construct something here. N11 might be slightly better.]
;B[le];W[kf];B[ke];W[je];B[lf];W[lg];B[kg];W[jf];B[mg];W[lh]
;B[og]C[AB: Seems small.];W[oi]C[AB: Is this necessary?];B[pf]
;W[qh];B[nj];W[mk];B[nk];W[mj]LB[bm:a][sc:b][ab:c][qm:d][ff:e]
C[AB: White gained two points here, that is way to small for the current state of the game. All the marked points are much larger.]
;B[ea];W[eb];B[fa]C[AB: The monkey jump must never be gote, so G19 would be better here. Then White must D19, but Black can ignore.]

(;W[ni]C[AB: What? No need to connect two living groups. Is this even one point? I think not.]

;W[ar];B[cm]C[AB: White got A2 in sente, this is big.];W[sc]
;B[rb];W[qe]LB[sb:a]C[AB: Again, T18 would be better.];B[pe]
;W[pi];B[ol];W[kp];B[lq]LB[ab:a]C[AB: Small. A18 is much bigger.]

[rq][sd][se][sf][sg][sh][si][sj][so][sq][sr][ss]C[So I won but not by as much as I expected and I think had I made one little mistake I might have lost it.  Any overall advice

AB: Yes, with komi you would have lost. The White upper area is larger than one would have thought initially. On the other hand the Black area in the bottom right is quite smaller than one thought. The reason is the M4 stone and your fixation on keeping the territory there. But this is the most overconcentrated area on the board. In general I think you should take a little more care of your own groups (in this game the two groups on the left). Attacking and defending starts with cutting and connecting. If you have only a few groups you can concentrate on territory, if you have a lot of groups you are constantly busy. Hope this was helpful, best wishes for the future. If you have any further questions don't hesitate to contact me.]
