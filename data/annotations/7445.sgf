(;B[fp]C[This is very loose play, black it's taking advantage of his
handicap.  Continuations starting with C5 are more
common.];W[dg];B[ce]C[In retrospect, I'm not sure about this move.  What I was thinking about at the time was stealing a base for W and to keep W's group weak.

Not terrible, but you are weaking D10];W[fj]
(;B[em]C[I was thinking to threaten connection with the black stones as well as building up a somewhat larger moyo on the side.

You don't have even a potential moyo on the side, you
have a potential prisoner in a white moyo.  You ought
to think first about making  a base, second about escaping
and connecting to the top or the bottom.  C12 and
C8 would be natural continuations.  

Better, though, is to not be in this situation, you've let white
place 3 stones around D10 without either securing any
territory (both corners are still open) or putting any meaningful
pressure on the attacking stones.];W[dl];B[ch];W[cg];B[eh]C[I figured I could get out and enclose W even if I had to sacrifice a stone.  I'm not sure whether that dogs head shape was good in this context, though.

If you want out (which is pretty much the only
choice at this point) try E9];W[dh];B[ei];W[cj];B[ff];W[di]
;B[ej];W[ck];B[el]C[This is continuation of the fight on the side is  fundamentally
misguided - here black is trying to enclose a side group,
but all four corners are still up for grabs.];W[ek]C[This is a mistake for white.  It results in weakening 
his position and wastes sente];B[fk];W[dk];B[gj];W[nq]C[Would this variation have been better for black?]

(;B[lq];W[qn];B[oo]C[Good];W[pl];B[pq];W[no];B[nn]C[I think that I just inadvertently made W stronger by contact here.  Not sure what else I could have done, though.]

(;B[io];W[jn];B[in]C[This is chasing white a little too hard.  The cutting point
at J4 is very dangerous.];W[ip];B[kp];W[ko];B[mq];W[np]
(;B[hp]C[This is not a good idea - it's very dangerous to cur off your
own group like this, especially against a stronger player.]

if you don't let it have extra liberties. See variation.];W[jr]

;B[nr];W[ks];B[mr];W[rp];B[pn]C[I think I was trying to prevent a cut at P6.  Was it even worth worrying about?  Or should I have connected more solidly at P6?]
;W[qm];B[im];W[eq];B[do]C[Again, I think I was worried having my starpoint stone cut off.

Reasonable fear.];W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[nf];B[mj]C[Seeing that my lone stone was getting enclosed, I jumped out.]
;W[oj]C[But seeing as how easily black was cut, I wonder if N10 was an error. Maybe not so far?

Right, O10 would be more conventional.];B[of];W[og];B[oe];W[ng]

This is too high. G17 would be a lot better.  There's just
too much room near the edge to leave it open.];W[jh]C[This is really desperation on the part of white.]

on, B L16 kills white's center group.  Apparently neither
player realized this.]

(;W[kb]C[This is a huge bunder for white.  All he has to to is 
connect at M16 and he is alive.];B[kd]C[Given white's blunder, this is the game winning move.]
;W[le];B[ja]C[White resigns.

See move 156.  Everything after this point was a delusion.

Up to that point, Black did a pretty good job of responding
to the right threat and avoiding pointless fights.

 In a game with a handicap this large, white starts in a 
desperate situation, and almost has to be overly aggressive.
If black responds fairly passively, he almost has to win.
The key is to try to form areas that are too small to invade.]
