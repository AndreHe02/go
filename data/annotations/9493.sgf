Hi, my name is Tim Kington, and I'm 1d AGA.  If you have any questions or comments on the review, you can reach me at timkington@gmail.com.  Make sure you read the comments at the end, as well as the variations.]

You did okay in this game, but you got pushed around a bit.  It seems like you're too ready to answer White's moves, and you don't think about ignoring them enough.  Also, you need to look for White's weaknesses and not just worry about your own.  You had quite a while where you could put pressure on the group at the top, and later there were two huge endgame moves that you could have taken any time.  You need to watch for opportunities like that and jump on them.  Especially ones like F19 and K1, which you can take in sente.]
