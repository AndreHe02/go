AB[pd][dp]C[Hi I played as black this game. It was a well fought game and I thought I was up until one of my big groups died.

I think I played this very well, and if you can please point out my good moves and approaches so that I can use that kind of thinking more.

In the end I let my group get surrounded and I lost.



T : Hello, I'm Tilwen (about 1k KGS) and I am your reviewer for this game. I'll put a T before my comments.
  The lesson that can be learned from your game is that having a weak group affect a lot the way the game goes : you must be aware of the weak group on the board and plan your strategy knowing this.
  I put some advices not related to the weak group, but mostly what made you lose is that you miss the moments to take care of your weak group : you played some moves that made it even weaker, and you played tenuki when it was urgent to protect it.

  I'm looking forward for any feedback or further questions !]
;W[pq];B[po];W[qm]C[T : For your information, I give some advice about this pincer. It is quite severe and will often lead to a fight. What you need to know in this very shape is that white threats to connect his two stones (see variation where black plays C16).
  Then you have several choices : split and fight with S5 or P6 (I put one sequence of each), or settle with R3 (I put another sequence).
  You can alse tenuki, in which case white can link up, you get another move somewhere, and your Q5 stone is weak but has aji. Your choice of move (the tobi at O5) doesn't split white in two groups, and you end with two (instead of only one) weak stones, that's a bit sad.]

(;B[no];W[qo]C[I wasn't sure how to reply to this block and thought it wasn't too aggressive so I tenuki'ed.]
;B[dd];W[fc];B[cf];W[db];B[cc];W[ic];B[mc];W[fq];B[cn]C[T : This is probably a bit passive, you get two low stones on the left side, D6 is more active.]
;W[jp];B[pp];W[qp];B[oq];W[pr];B[lq]C[T : This is a nice flexible move that gives you eye space.]
;W[kq]C[T : But this is really forcing, you really don't want white to play M4, you need to play the nobi. And then you can aim at invading at J3 for instance (see variation).]

(;B[or];W[pn];B[hp]C[T : This move really is questionnable. You must ask yourself what is your plan here. Your group on the right isn't alive yet, and H4 is strenghtening the white group. This can't be good for you.]
;W[hq];B[fp];W[gp];B[go];W[gq];B[fo]C[T : White is strong and has sente. H4 made your right group weaker.]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[lr];B[mq];W[lo];B[io];W[ip];B[eq]C[T : There is an important go proverb saying "Urgent move before big move". E3 is a big move (taking points), but playing around O7 for instance (protecting your weak group) is urgent, you should play this first.]
;W[nm]C[T : Now white surrond you with two strong groups and goes on the attack.]
;B[mr];W[kr];B[mn];W[km];B[mm];W[nl];B[qf]C[T : Urgent move before big move. You let white make your group even weaker.]
;W[oo];B[op];W[nn];B[mo];W[on];B[nq];W[ns]C[T : This is a white's mistake, he should just enclose you with N8, forcing you to play O1, and get sente to play elsewhere. This would be really good for him. He can't really expect (at this point of the game) to kill your group, because you can move to the center.]
;B[ll];W[kl];B[lj];W[kk];B[lk];W[dj]C[I thought this was a very good move and I wasn't too sure about my response to it.

T : White takes a point that would have been big for you, but it doesn't really threat anything (both your left corners are alive for now) and you don't need to answer locally. In my opinion you should play around O11 (or P10 or Q10), defending your weak group while making a little moyo in the upper right corner.]

;B[bq];W[lm];B[ml];W[bp];B[ao];W[ds];B[es];W[cs];B[as];W[fs]
;B[er];W[qc]C[T : White isn't supposed to live easily here.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[od];B[nc];W[rd]
(;B[qe]C[T : Why not S15 ? White can't live easily then. If white tries to move P16, he probably can cut you in two groups, but the corner will die fast, and the position is OK for you (see variation).]
;W[pa];B[re];W[rc];B[nk];W[ok]C[T : You need to do something from this exchange, or don't play it.]
;B[pi]C[T : This is quite questionnable too, at least I don't understand why you play O9 first.]
;W[nj];B[ni];W[oj];B[oi]C[T : Now you are forcing white to cut you, just what he wants. You could play N11 or N12 instead. Protecting your weak group is the most important thing.]
;W[mj];B[mi];W[li]C[T : White cuts, but in this area black is stronger, so you can attack it. The atari at L11 would be OK if P16 was captured (see variation), but here it's hard for you.]

(;B[kj];W[lh];B[ij];W[cg];B[dg]C[T : Be careful of the direction of play, if you push and white follows here, he will end enclosing your weak group.]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[eh];B[fg];W[fh];B[gh];W[gi]
(;B[hh];W[hi];B[ii];W[ih]C[T : Now your group is in real trouble.]
;B[ig]C[T : And again, this make white's group stronger and your group weaker.]
;W[jh]C[T : The four white stones are stronger than before.]
;B[hk];W[fk];B[ch]C[T : This tenuki is probably the fatal mistake, you really really need to connect your center weak group somewhere, with H7 for instance. The upper left corner seems alive as it is, then C12 is big but not urgent.]
;W[ci];B[bg]C[T : You end gote, and white goes for the kill.]
;W[gl];B[hl]C[I think this move cost me the game, as far as I can see J7 would have allowed me to survice.


T : I think your group is dead anyway here.

Conclusion : you played some questionable moves that made white stronger and you weaker, you missed the big point at M4, and you tenuki two times when your group was in danger. Your moves in other areas weren't bad, but only locally : when you have a big weak group on the board, you MUST take care of it. It'll cost or course, that's why we usually try not to have weak groups in the opening, but if he dies it's often game over.
