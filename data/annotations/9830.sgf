C[pony16 [5k\]: Hi
jjc [5k\]: Hi

F: Good game for both players.
Main points:
1/ Leaving the weakness at D13
2/Wrong direction of 64, this is the turning point of the game
3/ Missing reverse sente endgame move at 162];B[pc];W[dd];B[cq]
;W[pp];B[qe]C[This doesn't seem like a great move for black, as it just encourages me to make an extension along the top.
F: This is ok for black, your extension on the top side too.]
;W[jc];B[lc];W[gc]C[This move I was unsure about. Is it better for white to simply jump out? Or maybe play high, around G16 instead?
F: Jump out is good to limit the black moyo on the right side, but then there is plenty of opporunity for black to invade on the upper side so I think this move is also ok.]
;B[do];W[jq];B[cf]
(;W[ch]C[This felt like an overplay for black? White is strong here, and white's pincer feels like a good move.
F: The black kakari is normal. You have two possibilities, pincer or defend your corner. See var.]

(;B[ef]C[F: I would prefer a jump in the corner.];W[eh];B[gf]
;W[bd]
(;B[cj]C[I think black needed to prevent me from just connecting underneather here?
F: But then you get a perfect extension on the left side. See var.]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[cg];B[be];W[df]
(;B[af]C[F: Not good];W[ce];B[bh]C[F: Now there remains a ko.]
;W[gh]C[F: Taking the ko, makes white very strong. Now you still have a weakness on D13.]
;B[if]C[As white, I already felt ahead in this game, so where did it all go wrong!
F: I think the game is still even.]
(;W[je]C[See var];B[ih]C[Maybe letting black turn is too nice? But I wanted to prevent the connection to the strong black corner.
F: Your idee is right, but now D 13 becomes really annoying.
H12 for black would be better shape, not leavin around cutting points.]
;W[qj];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro]
(;W[qn]C[I was tempted by the double-hane here, would that have been better or worse?
See var];B[rn];W[qm];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[nq];B[gq];W[hp];B[gp]
;W[ho];B[kf];W[qg];B[dg];W[bf]
(;B[cc]C[F: Bad ko threat! Black throws it away here. See var]
;W[ae]C[F: Good];B[dc];W[ec];B[bc];W[bb];B[ed];W[eb];B[ee];W[de]
;B[di];W[dh];B[ci]C[F???
Succes for white. Weakness disappeared and black gaind nothing.]

(;W[oe]C[F: Wrong direction. Now it's time to expand  your moyo on the lower side, or attack  the black stone on the left side (white became strong on the upper side). See var.]
;B[pf];W[oc];B[ob];W[pd];B[nc];W[od];B[qc];W[qd];B[rd]C[F: Now white is under attack...]

(;B[kd];W[nb];B[pb];W[mc];B[ph];W[qh];B[jd];W[ic];B[lm]C[F: Succes for black White is not alive on the upper side yet and he gets sente  to reduce your moyo.]
;W[rc]C[I think this cut was bad for white. My group to the left is not strong, and I can't really attack blacks lower group while that is the case. Maybe this cut is for later when N16 becomes stronger?
F: Good reasoning.];B[rb];W[re];B[sc];W[rf];B[mg];W[lg];B[nf]

;W[ie];B[hd];W[he];B[gd];W[ge];B[fe];W[kh]C[F: But now you can start a splitting attack, so the reslut is not that bad. 
First exchange F17 for F16 makes your upperside  stronger.]

(;B[dp]C[Here I was playing calmly as I (incorrectly) assumed I was ahead. Maybe I needed to be more aggresive here, If I'd realised I was behind.
F: It's al litte bit late to be agressive now. The best you can do is try to steal some point from te center right black group.]
