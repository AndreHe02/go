C[D: This match was a rather interesting one because of black's opening (played crossed opening on 5-3).

M: Hi - I'm Mark Schlatter and will be reviewing your game. This is my first review for GTL, so if you have questions or concerns, let me know at mschlat@gmail.com.  

I will try to focus on good guiding principles (and not necessarily specific moves), since that information is more transferable to other games.  

I take lessons from shygost (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Shygost) and may sometimes refer to his "List" (found on the same web page).]
;B[oq];W[pd]C[D: I figured I could try to use a standard opening and take sente, then punish the unstandard opening move.

M: Please note that the 3-5 is not "unstandard" --- you can find more information about it at http://senseis.xmp.net/?35Point or in Kosugi and Davies _38 Basic Joseki_.  In this game, the opening accomplishes its purpose; your opponent ends up with lots of outside influence on the top, bottom, and center.

That's a lot of words to say that while you can respond to this move, it's not a mistake to "punish".]
;B[ec];W[dp]C[D: He forced me to cross (I prefer a horizontal or vertical opening since I can play more symmetrical).]
;B[bd]C[I thought I could punish this because of the flat movement.

M: The most important issue on the board right now is not the upper left.  (Yes, there may be issues with it, but black has sketched out a corner, as is her right).  The big issue now is to play in the unfinished corner (the lower right).

I've sketched out a few possibilities.  The basic idea is that you get corner territory while black gets outside influence.]

(;W[cf]TR[dc][ec][bd][cd]C[D: Should I have done a more solid peep or was this close enough? Or cut directly  at C17 or D17?

M: It is far too early in the game to consider cutting or attacking.  After all, if you make a move like C17, black can place a third stone in the area.  You are thus at a three-to-one disadvantage.  Attacks like you are discussing are better done after you have some backup.

Note that if you aren't playing in the lower right, since black's corner faces the left side, it is a good idea to play on the left to prevent a large extension.  But I think this is too close.]

(;B[qo]TR[cf]C[M: Notice that black now has two corners and some outside influence.

In the variation, I show what happens to your move if black attacks.]

(;W[cd]LB[cc:A][ci:B][dj:C][pj:E][jp:D]C[D: 2-point extension?

M: Do you mean A?  If so, then no.  In the variation, black will just cut off your stone at A and probably still take the corner and outside.  It is still too early to attack.  (A 2-point extension is usually used to create a base for your group, not attack another group.)

You can create a base at B or start extending at C.  D and E are also large moves since both face the shimari (corner enclosure) in the lower right.  A basic proverb: in the beginning, choose size over the attack.]
;B[cc];W[dc]LB[ce:A]C[D: Probably should've gone D16 to protect the cut.

M: Agreed.];B[dd];W[ce];B[db]C[M: A small note here.  Moving near the black group this early has removed all of its awkwardness (the long knight's extension from E17 to B16), while not gving you a living group.  In short, your opponent has gained more from your moves than you have.  Try to play large moves in the beginning over small attacking moves.]
;W[ql]LB[db:D][pd:B][cf:A][qj:G][qo:E][dp:C][oq:F]C[D: Tenuki good? Or was this a wrong direction of play?

M: Well, your three groups (A, B, and C) are safe, as black's groups (D, E, and F).  So playing in a big area is a good idea.  And certainly, the right is a large area.  You might ask if you are comfortable with the pinch at R10.  If you run, black can settle and gain another living group (see variation).

For that reason, you might play around G so you have a two space extension on either side.  You might also consider the fourth line to combat black's emphasis on the center with the 3-5 plays.]

(;B[lp];W[jq];B[hd]
(;W[dj]LB[ci:A]TR[nc][qf][ql][jq]SQ[cd][ce][cf]C[M: Note that right now, the left is of little interest to black.  You have two stones (K3 and R8) which are useful for limiting black, but that you are not defending.  The top is also of interest to both of you.  So I believe the left, while very large, is not your best choice.  Consider the variations.

If you really like the left, consider a move that connects up to the marked group (say, A).]
;B[cn]
(;W[eq]C[D: This move seems odd.

M: Agreed.  Black has moved into an area where she's already pinched.  This is good news for you.  Why not kick?  (See variation.)]
;B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[ck]
(;W[bj]LB[cj:A][dk:B]TR[dj]C[M: Okay, here's another basis rule: "when touched, touch back".  In other words, your basic options to consider when your marked stone has been approached like this are either A or B. 
With your move, Black has the advantage until move 34, builds up a strong wall with potential in the center, and leaves you with some weaknesses.

With A (see variation), if black wants to build that wall, she has to push from behind, and you end up with no weaknesses.]
;B[cj];W[ci];B[bk];W[bi];B[dk];W[ej];B[ek]
(;W[fk]LB[di:1][fj:2]C[M: Notice that you have two weaknesses here at the numbered cuts (and that you don't have the ladder for 1.  Again, some of this is due to your choice at move 26.

A better choice than F9 might be F10.  See the variation for how to handle the cut if you play F10.]
;B[be];W[bf]LB[bd:A][fg:B][di:1][fj:2]TR[ad][ag][bg][cg][ah]
[bh][ch]C[M: I understand this response, but overall this is a very small move.  Black gains maybe one point, while you secure about six points.  Note that with the stone at A, you were already undercut.

Instead of this conservative move, you might consider something like B.  You protect the cut at 1, give help for a cut at 2, and start to move the group out.

Alternatively, you can make a "big area" move on the top.];B[ef]
;W[dg]LB[eh:A]C[M: Here I think A is a better response --- again, it helps with the cuts and moves out better.]
;B[fj];W[fi];B[gj]
(;W[fh]TR[dj][ej]C[D: Should I have continued to walk to make a more solid wall?

M: The problem with continuing is the weakness of the two marked stones.  In the variation, I show some possibilities if you go to G11.  With the aji of E14, there is the potential for some nasty fighting.]
;B[fl];W[fn]LB[mc:C][ck:A][dp:B]C[M: I don't have a strong sense for the purpose of this stone.  Black's A group is alive and healthy (so your stone is not an attack), and your B group is alive, but this stone doesn't really connect to it or K3.

Given that both your groups and black's are healthy, I'd make a move on the top.  Perhaps C for some influence.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[en]C[M: Here black has kindly turned your F6 stone into something useful!]
;W[fo];B[em];W[fm]C[M: I don't think this is a big move --- both groups involved are alive.  I would focus on the top instead.]
;B[gm]
(;W[gn]TR[fn][fo]C[D: Better to atari at F8 to take sente (see variation to see what I mean)?

M: I didn't see a variation, so I'll try it myself.  (I'm assuming you mean G8.)  

Note that you are forming the marked empty triangle, which is traditionally bad shape.

I would still move on the top.];B[hm];W[in];B[io]
(;W[hp]LB[ho:A][jo:B]C[M: Again, when touched, touch back.  I would prefer A or B to this (and probably B).]
;B[hn];W[ho];B[ip];W[iq];B[hq];W[gq];B[hr]LB[jo:A]TR[io][ip]
SQ[hq]C[M: Okay, you have two issues here with the two groups of marked stones.  Note that the squares can't run to the right because of your stones at J3 and K3.  If they run to the left, they run into your living group.  So there's not much chance for them to live, unless J3 and K3 die.  So, to protect J3 and K3, kill the top group with A.

Another way to look at this is that you have two cutting groups (J3/K3 and J6) and A protects them both.]
;W[gr];B[km]C[M: Note that A is still doable.  Black's ladder breaker does not help.]
;W[kd]LB[mc:A]C[D: Hoped to make better at the right side.

M: I'm not sure what you mean by this comment.  Ignoring the bottom, this is a good move in an important area.  I might pull back to A, but I prefer stronger connections between my stones.]
;B[jn]LB[jo:A]C[M: Note that A is still playable here.  You don't kill the stones , but do a great job of sealing off the H2 group.]

(;W[qi]C[M: Good!  This is bigger than A and gives you the potential for a powerful double wing.]
;B[kb];W[lc];B[lb]
(;W[mb]LB[mc:A]C[M: Don't be afraid to make black crawl here (see variation).  Sure, you lose a few points on the edge, but the wall you build up is worth at least twice those points.

Moreover, moving at A gives you stronger connections.];B[mc]

(;W[nc];B[md]
(;W[nd]C[M: Now defend at O18 (defense first!).   Otherwise you lose the stone and all of black's stones are connected and probably alive.  The variations show how you can then kill the L18 stones or move out to safety.]
;B[nb];W[ob];B[ma];W[pc]LB[je:B][pf:A]TR[oc]C[M: I don't follow the intent of this move.  Q16 already protects the marked cut.

If you are trying to get more side/corner territory, I'd go with A.  You can also run out with B.]
;B[oa];W[pa];B[na];W[pb]LB[jf:B][og:C][pn:D][qq:E][lr:A]SQ[lc]
[kd]C[D: This move seems premature looking back.

M: Agreed --- I see no need for this.  I think all groups are safe (except the marked stones, which are of questionable importance given they're next to a live group).  I've marked some big areas.  Of these, I think something around B is most important.  If you don't move there, black can create a huge territory on the top left.  After that, you need to invade or make a reduction of the lower right corner.]
;B[ne];W[oe]LB[hc:A][jf:B]SQ[pa][pb][pc][pd]C[M: Not a necessary move (especially given the marked wall) although you do get aji for the M17 and L16 stones.  At this point to have some impact on the upper left, you need to take some chances either around A or the region about B --- the O15 stone helps some in sealing off that area.]
;B[ld];W[og]SQ[qe][re][se][pf][qf][rf][sf][pg][qg][rg][sg]C[M: While this is a strong move (you're gaining around 12 points), you are also giving up most of the top (which is much bigger).]
;B[om]
(;W[ok]C[M: The variation shows some possibilities in the lower right, but it's very difficult to take much from black here.  The second variation shows a forcing invasion on the top.  These are merely speculation --- playing successfully here is very difficult for me.]
;B[pl]
(;W[pk];B[qk];W[rl];B[rj];W[qj];B[rk];W[ri];B[qm]
(;W[sk];B[rm];W[sj]C[D: Bad exchange?

M: Overall, yes.  You've solidifed area that was probably yours, while black now has a much stronger claim on the lower right corner.  I've tried to make some suggestions earlier on options.]
;B[kj];W[nj]C[M: Very small -- your group is alive.  Again, you want to try probes in the lower right or top.

C[sagator [10k?\]: j2

M: Do you realize that the K2 stones are dead (thus the J2 comment from your opponent)?]

(;B[mm];W[li]C[M: I understand the instinct here --- you see a possible weakness and try and exploit.  Here, you don't have many possibilities due to the thickness of black nearby.  Moreover, there are good potential reduction moves, but when you are this far behind, you need something larger.  You'd like to take these instincts and use them earlier when areas aren't as settled.

That's my last comment on this game.  You are definitely doing the right thing in asking for reviews --- that's a great way to get better.  I would also focus on the following:

1) Try to locate "large moves" on the board --- wide areas of interest to both players --- and avoid playing close to your own settled groups.

2) When touched, touch back.

3) Think about cutting stones and how to protect them.

As I said before, I'd be happy to answer questions at mschlat@gmail.com.  You can also find me as mschlat at either KGS or dragongoserver.net.]
