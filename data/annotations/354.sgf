[dd];W[pp];B[dq];W[pd];B[nq];W[np];B[pq];W[qq];B[qo]C[not a good move.

white has to made the connection and then the black stones on both sites  are weak.]
;W[qp]C[very good for  white];B[oo]
(;W[oq]LB[op:A]MA[pq]C[Thats a mistake. the black  stone at p5 is waiting for a chance to cut and you give it to him. Its  better to play at a by yourself, the marked black stone is captured  anyway if you want to capture him. (see variation)]
;B[op]C[The  cut is good for black.];W[pr];B[mp]C[Black is very happy  in building a thick group into the centre. Remember this stones were  very weak 2 moves  ago.]

(;W[oi]C[leaves a lot of cutting points behind.
Black can use the cutting points to settle his group.];B[oj];W[nj];B[pj]
;W[mk]C[painfull but necessary i think.

Black now is one move ahead.];B[pi];W[ph]LB[oh:A]C[Again it  creates cutting points in your own groups. In my oppinion the black  group can't be killed so a move at a would be more  solid.]
;B[qh];W[pg];B[qg];W[qf]LB[pf:A]C[That's definitly bad because of your cutting points. Now black not only gets  live easily, he cuts of your stones wasting all your influence you want  to build up. This stone clearly must be at a!]
;B[oh];W[ni];B[pf];W[og];B[of];W[ng];B[qe]C[Now the corner is'nt white anymore.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[pe]LB[nd:A]C[it doesnt help white very much. Better simply play at a]
;B[ne];W[nd];B[me];W[md];B[rc]C[Now black is clearly ahead in territory and there is no  group he has to look after.]
;W[qn];B[qm];W[do]C[a very clever kakari because it is not only kakari. This stone also sets  up a ladder from the upper right corner. Black has to keep this in mind  in looking for an answer.]

(;B[eo]MA[nr]LB[le:A]C[Not as good ad it  seems. Building up a moyo at the bottom is not very big because the  marked white stone becomes a chance to spoil it. If the move is played  as a ladder-breaker it is a better idea to break the ladder direktly at  a]
;W[dp];B[ep];W[cq];B[dr];W[cr];B[dn]LB[fq:A]C[very risky, simply connection at a would be solid. The meaning of a  connection is not to make the whole bottom area black territory, but to  keep things simple. Black has a lead and should not complicate the  game.]
;W[eq]
(;B[er]C[black should sacrifice the two stones.  tey are not very helpful yet but may be they become a burden  later.]

C[very good. Because it is now possible to connect to the right, the cut at e3  is a success for white]
;B[ls]C[Is this possible? I think the  black group is in danger and it should allow white to get away with his  cutting  stones.]
;W[js];B[ir];W[ds];B[es];W[gs];B[cs];W[io]LB[oe:A]MA[mp][mq][nq][op][oo]
[on][nn][lr][ls][ko][jo]C[Now  white gets out and the territory black wants to get is wasted. The  marked group becomes weak and the ladder starting with a is again in  whites favor. A full success for  White.]
;B[in];W[gn];B[fo];W[hn];B[br];W[fp]LB[cp:A]C[better to connect the cut at a
this would keep the black corner very small.];B[cp];W[co];B[bp];W[bo];B
[cm]C[Playing  now the ladder at a would be very great, because white has now problems  with his upper group than. On the other hand it also would split the  black groups into two, which also favors white.]
;W[cl];B[bm];W[bl];B[ao];W[dm];B[cn];W[gp];B[dj]C[To close to the white strong group]

;B[bf];W[ci];B[gf];W[hg]C[Black has  to do somethink for the marked stones. If he does to late, white takes  to much in the centre.]

;B[lp];W[ln]C[now the game is  over.

black can't rescue the stones and white got a very big  territory]
