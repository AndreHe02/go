C[Alright lets see what happened here.  

I'm not going to nit-pick your fighting too much.  I'm a sports coach in real life and my experience has taught me that focusing on finding and correcting faulty patterns of thought is more valuabe than pointing out every mistake.  I'm hoping I can find a couple of things here that wil change the way you think about positions enough to get you 20 points more per game on average.  Better fighting will come from your own study and experience so I'll only point out a few things related to that.

Keep in mind that I'm no master of go.  My own thoughts and opinions are certainly debatale!]

(;B[jp]LB[qm:A]TR[oc][de]C[So far up to this move I have no complaints about Black's play.  But this move feels slack to me.  Its fairly big and it has that going for it but it isn't agressive so I think you could have done better.  At 'A' I've shown a standard sort of exchange with black crowding the white stone on the right side while making a loose shimari at the same time.]
;W[cj];B[cg];W[cm];B[df]C[I like this move.  the center here seems way more important than the left side which will be split.]
;W[fd]C[White really let the group in the upper left become powerful.  it should have been a trade where in return for making modest points in the corner, that group gets shut out of the center and left side. instead Black's gotten it all.]
;B[ql]C[no need for this move to have been quite so far from Q4. this is a good direction of play but it feels a bit loose to me.]
;W[qg];B[kc];W[jc];B[kd]SQ[ol][fq]C[the problem I have with this move, and here might be your 20 point per game idea, is this:

It's gote.  you could have played an aggressive forcing type move anywhere on the board.  Instead you played one that just gives him control.  I've marked some moves I might have considered that pressure the opponent while making some points.

I especially like P8 becuase there is a large potentail for points in the lower right and so far you've only got three loosely conected stones there.  P8 makes attacking that area effectively much harder for white.]

(;B[rb]C[Again you happily take gote for what in this position is a pretty small amount of points. the variation shows how I would have probably approached this.]
;W[rh]C[Wow he hands it right back.  Your lucky day!];B[io]
C[Ok here is your other 20 point per game idea:

 'Winning' an attack doesnt usually mean killing the attacked group.  Winning an attack means making a move that gains you a lot of points while forcing him to make a move to live.  If you can get one or two moves out of an attacking sequence that give you 10 points while your opponent's replys barely get him life, you've attacked successfully.this move just appears to strengthen his group while chasing it into a direction that it might want to go to anyhow. i really don't see how this move will end up gaining anything for you.

;B[kn];W[ko];B[km];W[ln];B[hl]C[Yep, you had two big cut-points to defend. not sure which was bigger but both were huge.]
;W[jb]TR[qk]
(;B[kb]C[this isnt small. but R9 is more important, much bigger. you had to take the lesser of two evils here and use the opportunity to play R9]
;W[ka];B[la]C[again, R9 is demanded.];W[ja];B[mb]C[and again.]
;W[qk]C[  All the life and death is settled, and a feel like white has come out better, Black has in my opinion one more chance to take this game.]
(;B[oi]C[P13 admitting those three stones are lost but getting ready to take some points is the last try. Here's a variation.]
;W[og]C[The dagger through the heart. the black stones are doomed and now white has been invited, almost forced into the last area Black could have made some points.]

;W[ba];B[ac];W[aj];B[ah]C[So you've got some things to work on and think about for future games:  

1) Remember to always be watching for opportunities to ignore your opponet's attacks and attack something bigger.

2) when you attack try to make profit while your opponent struggles to live. Profit should be your main thought.  Killing is nice and fun but profit wins games just as well. Be aware of what areas of the board you have a chance to make big points in and steer the opponent away from those areas even if it lets him live easier.

3) in the endgame always look for moves that force a reply.  Just like in the beginning, look for your opponent to make a small attack and reply with a bigger attack elesewhere. Don't make a gote endgame move until you have run out of sente moves.

thanks for reading and good luck!

C[Cutting off R10 is worth easily more than allowing S17 and there is good potentail to pick up more points around the triangles.    

When the opponent attacks something it feels safer to just respond but that's a very serious error.  Always look for a way to attack something even bigger if possible.]
))
(;B[qm];W[qg];B[fq]C[This is both an extension fron the lower right shimari and an approach to the 4-4 stone. sure white has a lot of options how to proceed but Black is making senteish moves that help his game.  Putting this stone at f4 instead might be even better but it's hard for me to correctly evaluate the difference.]
