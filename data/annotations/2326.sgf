AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Submitted for review by Mark Harrison (fugume).  I played black.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[rd]
(;B[qd];W[re];B[qn];W[qj];B[ql]LB[jq:A]TR[ql]C[This is much to small for the opening. Something around A (K3) would be much bigger. Your two stones Q4 and R6 make a shimari, that is a corner enclosure. Playing in front of a corner enclosure (your own or your opponent's) is always big]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[nr]LB[jp:A][jq:B]TR[nr]C[This is also rather small. Something like A or B might be good to pressure the two white stones.]
;W[mr];B[or];W[kp];B[dj];W[fc];B[rc]TR[qc][qd]C[I chose to abandon the upper left corner in favor of building strenght elsewhere.  The upper right corner looked weak to me.

PNH: You should never abandon a corner without a fight. It is true that the upper right (P16) corner is a bit weak -- it would have been somewhat stronger with R17 at R17 -- but anwering on the left seems more important to me.]
;W[cf];B[ch]C[I was still thinking to let the upper left corner go, but I wanted to limit extenstions from there along the left side.]
;W[cc];B[cm];W[gq];B[eq]TR[jc][df][eq][gq]C[This one bugged me.  I felt like I should have a relatively safe attack on white's G3, but I wasn't sure, and I wanted to beef up the corner a little before getting risky.

PNH: This is good for your corner (although it can still be invaded at C3) but the white G3 stone isn't threatened because it has strong support on the right. I think I might have claimed K17 after the loss of the upper left corner, instead of playing E3. Or D14 to contain white.]
;W[ee]C[This gives white a huge corner.];B[gr]LB[jc:A][gp:3]
[fr:2][hr:1]C[I was happy to see white play in the upper left again, and moved in for an attack on g3.  But, perhaps this wasn't a good square to start it from?  In response to 1, I had to fall back to 2, and then with 3 white had suddenly staked out quite a bit of territory.

PNH : A (K17) is still a very big spot.];W[hr];B[fr];W[gp];B[fn]
;W[kc]C[Argh, the angst!  Perhaps my last move should have been on this side.

PNH: Yes.]
(;B[lb]LB[jd:A]TR[ch][dj][jj]C[Maybe better, a shoulder hit at A (K16) to contain white and maybe stake some territory on the center with the help of your marked stones.]
;W[kb];B[la]LB[id:E][fg:A][qh:B][ho:D]C[This is much too small. One should never play on the first line like that in the opening. There are lots of bigger points.]
;W[ka];B[ld]LB[id:A][nf:B][hn:C][io:D]TR[ld]C[This is an unusual way to jump ahead. I would still rather peek at A. Your corner stones are save and white can't really contain them with one move. You could also jump at B. Imagine white playing at either A, B or C. (C or D are other possibilities for you)]
;W[ke];B[lf]TR[fc][kc][ld][ee][ke][lf]C[Here white's stones are working together. Your marked stones are much less efficient.]
;W[nf]TR[nf][qf][qj]C[See? ;-) You are running out with no purpose since you upper right corner lives. White's marked stones are working well.]
;B[lc]LB[he:B][oh:A]TR[ld][lf]SQ[jj]C[Was this move too conservative?  I was very nervous that white might play here, forcing me to play at n18, and threatening to isolate the marked stones.  But, perhaps that threat wasn't real?

PNH: Right. There is no threat. M14 can run to its friend in the center.
I might play around A or B instead, to prevent white from enclosing too much territory.]
;W[le];B[ne]C[I thought I really was doing the right thing here.  I felt like I was claiming territory and attacking.  But this whole corner quickly wound up contained.  Where did I go wrong?

PNH: I gave you some suggestions.];W[me];B[of];W[oe];B[nd];W[og]
;B[od];W[pe];B[qc]C[This was a bit too shy. There was no way for white to invade, I think.]
;W[mf];B[sd]LB[he:C][fg:B][oi:D][io:A]C[This is much, much too small. Consider A, B, C or D.]
;W[qe];B[on];W[pk];B[qk];W[rj];B[pl];W[ok]LB[sm:A]C[Later on you'll have to take care of the possibility of T7 for white : the monkey jump.]
;B[ol];W[nm];B[nl];W[nn];B[no]LB[he:A][ni:B][ho:C]C[Again, there are bigger points. A, B, C, etc.]
;W[mo];B[oo]C[This is gote for you, so not very good. Now white gets to take a big point.]
;W[mn]C[But, fortunately doesn't ;-)];B[ml]C[With this move I committed to connecting across the center.  I thought I was going to claim a lot of territory from white in all three directions that white had a presence.  But, in the end my center territory was rather small.

PNH: Yes, center territory if often smaller than it seems.]
;W[eh];B[qq]LB[he:A][hf:B]TR[eh]C[I thought I had a comfortable lead, and that my biggest danger might come from a bungled containment of a san-san invasion.  But, perhaps this move was premature, and instead I should have been staking out more territory.

PNH: Yes, you ought to contest white's upper left corner, which is becoming humongous. Now A might be suicidal, but B is possible. With some luck you might cut the white makred stone as white closes defends the top.]
;W[sm];B[rl];W[sl];B[rm];W[rk];B[sn];W[sk];B[fj]LB[gi:A]C[Nice. A is also possible.]
;W[gi]LB[ig:B][ih:A]C[A or B might be more urgent.];B[gj];W[hj]
;B[hi];W[hh];B[ii];W[gn];B[go];W[ho];B[fo]C[This is also gote, so not so good.]
;W[gm];B[hk];W[ih];B[kl];W[jm];B[jl]LB[km:A]TR[jl]C[I would rather go down, myself. You play sente, force you oponent to answer and keep the initiative.]
;W[im];B[hl];W[mj];B[lj];W[li];B[ki];W[lh];B[kh];W[kg];B[jg]
;W[jh];B[ij]C[You saw the double atari threat, Good.];W[gh]
;B[cq];W[km];B[nk];W[nj];B[fm];W[dg]C[That was rather big.]
;B[dh];W[ei];B[di];W[ej];B[ek];W[bg];B[cg]LB[be:3][bf:2][df:1]
C[Before making this move I counted.  Things looked grim.  I thought white looked weakest here on the left side.  But, after the next 3 moves, I couldn't see a way to make progress here.  My opponent, though, tells me this was a particularly good move because it prevented a monkey jump, whereby white could have invaded on this side.]
;W[df];B[bf];W[be];B[hs];W[ir]
(;B[is]C[And perhaps by now I should have resigned, but is there any remaining opportunity that I am missing?  Could I have done any real damage at L16?

PNH: It seems so.];W[js];B[gs];W[jr];B[lm];W[ln];B[hm];W[hn]

;B[mc];W[lg];B[fp];W[hp];B[fi];W[fh];B[fk];C[This was a nice game. You played rather well but you skipped some big points. A bit more experience and you'll get an eye for the big points in the opening and mid game.

I haven't played go at all for the last three months of so and I feel I might have lost a few kyus. I might come back to this review in a few weeks and if I have better advices to give I'll let you know.

In the meantime, if you have more questions, just e-mail me.

With kind regards,
