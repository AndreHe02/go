C[R: Hi

I will prefix my comments with R.
As you started with some long comments, let me also align and start by saying that the game of go is a game of balance. Well, this is theory, but also it is the reality, The level differs: maybe is the bablance between life and death (killing) for the beginners, maybe is a balance between of shapes later, a balance between strategic offensive and defensives for dan players? Dunno. But for sure always you need to find this balance.
Killing groups is never a bad thing. A balance between warrior and priest, maybe? So don't be afraid to kill, to fight for life or to invade.
Anyway, good shapes. This is a long story. Sometimes a shape is good, other time is bad. In the same board situation, for a 20k a shape is good, for 10k is bad. And maybe for 1dan is divine! But indeed, some good shape are never lying: shimari, ikken tobi, the trustful kosumi and so on. While an empty triangle is useful in very few situations.
Another balance is between reading (and yes, read, again and again. Meijin games could have last for days) and sensing the good shape. Of course the feeling come in time, and as Isaid, is different for different levels. So pe patient and just recognize forms. And read ahead, always, as much as you can. Maybe online games won't help you on that, so maybe you can try turn based sites?

Hello, dear reviewer
Thank you very much for helping me work out what I did wrong in the game. My personal style (if at 17k one is allowed to speak of one) is very peacefull: trying to have good shape, not trying to kill groups if I can profit by attacking and not building overly huge moyos forcing my oponent to invade them.

In this game my oponent forced me to try to kill him whenever he could and I was unable to do so, which lost me the game. Since this was one of the most complicated games I've played, the 30 minutes of time weren't enaugh, and I was in byoyomi at move 72, in a position I couldn't read out even given hours of time. Finally, in an already clearly lost position, I resigned after a blunder.

In your review, I would like to ask you to focus not so much on the technical details of the possible complicated lines (although they're already to difficult for me to make out which of my moves were the most outrageous blunders and if there are ways of telling so without reading 15 moves ahead), but rather on my shape and how much I should expect from punishing my oponent's outrageous moves - as in: what should I try and expect to get from it, what will he get. I will be including a lot of my thought process in comments. Please try to comment on which parts of my assessment and general principles I believe to be applicable are true and which are false.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dp]TR[dd]C[R: If W place first stone along the side with B, B placing opposite (triangle) tend to lead to more complicated local situations, with smaller moyos threats]
;W[dd]C[R: joseki are very good. Learn a few of them by heart, but more important try to understand WHY a joseki (anyone you want) is joseki, by playing variations.
If you say so, I am personally fan of 3x4 komoku, and when I am W in 3 stones handicap game, I play often 3x3.

I always play 4-4s in the opening, maybe I should swich to playing a couple 3-4s; but up until now, probably quite rightly so, I've been thinking that playing, let alone studying joseki would be an utter waste of time for me at this point. Which is not to say I haven't wasted any time doing so.]
;B[jp]C[R: in fuseki isn't a matter of securing a moyo, but to gain influence. For instance such high play (line 4) is more aiming toward center than side.
See variant to understand.

I always lose playing against this. My oponent's "strategy" in this game was apparently to completely secure the bottom for himself, "give" me all the rest of the board, and then invade with the intent to kill me everywhere. Needless to say that's not a good strategy, but it worked.]

(;W[qn]C[R; it is one way. Personally in such situation I would aim for middle of sides, because I deny double wing situation. See variant.

I believe this is normal.]
(;B[qp]C[R: This defensive play is a kind of balancing the high aproach on line 4. It secures the corner. Fine, take the side. Your benefit is greater in influenc than his in moyo (another way of striking the balance).
Low pincer (and even better for B high pincer) might be better for B just because this high fuseki. See variant.

Never seen that move before. Was expecting to play the one-space low pincer variation on both sides, which is supposedly good for white, although I've never beat it. This is just strange. Please tell me if at any time there were possibilities for a reasonable invasion of the bottom.
I don't want to play the 3-3 invasion on the other side, so I just back off here planing to give him the bottom by approaching the other side as well and then try to build a moyo myself according to where he plays.]
;W[qk]TR[pj]C[R; Is a safe mode, but doesn't threat the B influence, for this sake I would have play triangle]
;B[lp]TR[mq]C[R: and he could have a better choice: triangle

He just wants the bottom really badly... allright, let him have it.]
;W[cn];B[dn]C[R: I would say the attach joseki isn't particular good for B, because lets lot of ajis. And B is so high in this fuseki.

Have had bad experiences with this joseki... This adds one more to the long list. Are there viable alternatives that prevent the huge wall?]
;W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp]TR[fp][eq]SQ[eo]CR[jp][lp]C[R: and here you see the left ajis: W invasions on triangle threat to cut the B group after playing square. The marked B stones are too far and too high]
;W[em];B[fm];W[ck]C[R: Defenitely. In fact, the last W stone wasn't needed, it helps B to secure the ajis. Should have jump directly at C10
one space too close?];B[hp]TR[pg][dg]C[R: as long as it is fuseki in development, don't (DON'T) think in terms of moyo (lower side is his, how I will invade) but in terms of influence. Most importnat point I would see now is K16 around. Other big points are on the side.
Securing corner in this moment is to loose momentum. Don't aim teritory, aim influence.

Now my assessment is that the bottom is not invadable anymore. Nevertheless I'm sure I'm ahead right now. The plan is to make territory and reduce the middle he will undoubedly try to build.
I don't really know what to play here, so I enclose the corner where an invasion would be most trouble at the moment.]
;W[fc];B[fl]C[R: Nope, isn't. Even if the W group is encircled, to do this would need many stones, while W builds influence. Take the variant.

I kind'o wanna think this is gote...]
(;W[dg]C[R: Good enclosure, but still think of how big is middle of upper side. Again, focusing on enclosing moyos distracts you from getting the big influencing points on table.

Now my assessment is that the best black can get in that corner is ko, which I might chose to lose tetting a good wall to build the top and not having to worry about my bottom left group getting sealed in.]
;B[cg]C[Allright, the fun begins. To me this move is obviously wrong, but I respect it. In fact, I expect he'll be able to run or live, and in this position I prefer letting him live small and build a wall. However I'm not sure which side to block (or play something else even).]

(;W[cf]C[R: why? Simple proverb: play from your weak group against the strong group
I want to keep the corner...];B[ch];W[dh];B[bf]C[R: double hane is the way to go

Now I make a mistake. The double hane is asking too much here. I had some hallucinations of how this might turn out good for me.]
;W[be];B[ce]C[R; No, go on with double hane

Here I should probably do something to defend my corner? I realize that the double hane was a mistake. For a moment the added variation crossed my mind, which is almost certainly wrong too, although probably better than what I played...]

(;W[df];B[bd]CR[fc]C[R: If you look at my variant, this is the way I would have taken. Your W marked stone is best placed in limiting the corner invasion and using it to get the side

Now I make another mistake. I decide that taking his two stones is worth giving him a large portion of the corner, because it helps my bottom lower group. It's just that I don't really get to take his two stones, and even if I did it wouldn't be worth it, I'm sure...]
;W[bg];B[ae];W[bh]
(;B[cd]C[R: agree, B should have extend quickly inb corner. Ca easily now secure side: see variant. 

Didn't expect this move. I thought he would play the variation where he runs his two stones out. I totally misread that too.]

(;W[jd]C[R: good move. Don't be afraid the 2 W stones. Even if lost, you gain much more toward center. Still first you could have play the sente at D17

You probably flintch at this move. I decide that taking the two stones is slow and start doubting my calculation (shown in the variation) intending to give up my two stones on the second line. In which case this beggs the question: Why did I play them?]
;B[jc]C[R: very rare situation a hane is not good! But the direction?

Now this is getting silly... should I start extending instead of hane?]
;W[kc]C[R: good. The reason is the size of potential moyo: bigger in the rigth than left.
I'm trying to push him into "my wall" except that it's not a wall... in any case, I feel he has forced me to actually kill this.]
;B[ic];W[id];B[hc]
(;W[kb]TR[dd][fc]SQ[jd][id][cf][df][dg][dh]C[R: yes, seal. Think here rather than live / death in groups. W triangled group is not yet solid, while connecting it to rectangle W groups would make there a tremendous framework

taking away eye space. Probably should prioritize sealing him in? Would he have enaugh eye space to live in that case? I think he would. Should I let him live?]
;B[hd];W[he]CR[if]C[R: this is rather unproper hane, because there is a better shape at hand!]
;B[gd];W[fd];B[ge];W[hf]SQ[id][jd]TR[dd][fd][fc]C[R: and now you see why: anyway have to play one line away of the rectangle stones, and now B threatens to cut the initial weaker group]
;B[gf];W[gh]C[R: rather than "I die or you die" think of weak and strong groups. B has a weak group has to think of (not yet dead): why don't you use this to build moyos rather to kill?

right now my thinking is basically: either this dies or I do... This is very much the contrary of how I want to play go, but as I've said, I didn't think I had much of a choice. Maybe I did after all?]
;B[hg];W[gg]CR[id][jd][he][hf][gf][ge][gd][ic][jc][hd][hc][fd]
[fc][dd][hg]SQ[kc][kb][gh][df][dg][dh][cf]TR[ke]C[R: simple: weak and strong groups. Weak: circles, strong: square. Triangle: my choice for W

I spent a lot of time reading before playing that move... most of it was probably completely wrong. Here again I'm probably asking for too much and my shape is at the verge of breaking appart, but I don't know how to handle this.]

(;B[ie]C[R: Bad attack];W[if];B[jf];W[ig];B[hh]C[R: remember my triangle point?

Here I again spent a long time reading and "accidentally" played a different move from what I calculated as being best.]

(;W[kd];B[fg]C[R: read weak and strong groups];W[fh]C[R: good]
;B[ih];W[jg];B[jh];W[kg];B[dl]C[R: You settled the control in upper, stabilize on the left]
;W[cl];B[ei]
(;W[eh]C[I do read if I have other choices on both his peeps, but come to the conclusion that I don't. Still hoping to at least get my top left group out and avoiding a capturing race which I would lose.]
;B[ci]C[R: A loss of 6-8 points but sealing finally the B: not a tough choice

Which is why I'm almost happy to see this... sad];W[di];B[bi]
;W[dj]C[R: I would say is even a strong group. No real threat at this moment

connected, I believe the left bottom group is barely alive as it stands... that's hard though. Maybe I'm wrong.]
;B[qi]C[R: and now you see why my choice of Q10. Anyway, make an extension form corner: lot of teritory in corner and upper side, and your right side group should be able at least to fight for life

He attacks my base. That needs to live, or this is over. Not sure what's the best way to do that.]
;W[ok];B[oi];W[kh]TR[og][pg][qg]C[R: yeap, fuseki is ended, focus on groups and size of potential moyo in chuban

I think this is sente and it seems to give me a lot more influence than I had in the centre. Maybe even enaugh to link up my bottom right group and pressure his two stones there.]
;B[ki];W[li];B[ji];W[qf]C[R: actually not enough greedy, one line upper for secure upper side and pressure the 2 B stones

getting too greedy. Now I'm again hoping that the corner invasion is not as severe. But playing in the centre is probably urgent.]
;B[qd]TR[qf]C[R: not classical, but not very helpful. If aiming for corner, should go on sansan. The triangle W stone can run for center.

Never seen this move. Kind'o feel this should die. Wasn't sure If I wanted to kill it and leave lots of aji for him...]

(;W[qe]C[R: no, the other hane];B[qc];W[pc];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb]
C[R: yeah, wrong B play, should have been 2x2

at this point I make the decision not to kill him (which I'm rather sure I could) and fix my shape instead for the tough battles to come in that area. Also, since I want to think that corner is big, I want ko threats which I will surely need. In retrospect I should have just killed him?]
;W[nc]TR[oe]C[R: wrong connection, think of triangle];B[re]
;W[rf];B[sd];W[lj];B[rk]C[Now comes another line that completely overwhelms me. My oponent seems to be reading absolutely none of this, as he still has about 14 minutes of time out of his initial 30. I'm in byo-yomi and completely intimidated.]

(;W[rl];B[nk]C[Now I try to seal and kill this. Clearly it's impossible, but I realize that too late.]
;W[nj];B[oj]
(;W[mk];B[pk];W[nl];B[pl];W[rj]C[R: no, is good variation. W lives and B has to worry about too many weak groups
probably very wrong... But I feel as if I need to strenghthen my 3 isolated stones somehow.]
;B[qj];W[ql];B[ri];W[sk];B[ol]TR[hd][gd][ge]SQ[qc][qd][ih][jh]
CR[np][nq]C[R: not important ko. All W groups are alive, B trinagle is dead, B square are weak, W cvan still invade at circles

at this point I'm thinking that a ko is good for me, since I have threats against his corner.]
;W[om];B[pm]
(;W[pn]CR[on]C[R: too many cutting points, better threat];B[nm]
;W[on];B[nk];W[sb];B[ml]CR[np][nq]C[R: count! W has all groups alive, B has 2 dead groups. Supposedly W won't invade on bottom: B has 60 points on bottom, 20 points on right up, perhaps 20 points in center. W has 60 points on upper side, 24 points in corner up, 10 points in left side. Clearly is W in lead, just because B has much more ajis than W

He just ignores....
and I instantly realize that he was right to do so....
At this point in the game I know I've lost. Even if I kill the corner now and my bottom right group lives, and even if I kill his top middle stones, he will have enaugh territory to make up for it. I can't hope for anything even remotely close to good endgame with my terribly weak middle stones with that huge cut in there and the weak bottom left group.]

(;W[ro]C[R: it is safe
I don't even follow up the ko threat... Need to save my group.]
;B[sc]C[R: if he doesn't play right, many chances not. Anyway, he lives there, you invide his corner and side: O4

He saves his group. I play a couple more moves and finally resign after he even captures a couple of my stones after a final blunder by me.]

(;W[rp];B[lh]
(;W[mh];B[lg];W[kf];B[lf];W[ke];B[ng];W[nh];B[og];W[oh];B[ph]
;W[pg];B[mg];W[pf];B[mi]C[R: look at the variant I designed with move 120 an on. B is penetrated in right corner and an invasion at O4 would pose many questions to him. W has around 80 points, B has 70 points (even if invasion at O4 is failing. Moreover, B has many fears. Look at these variants for instance

So, in my mind, W won the game. Well, except the big loss after move 119. 
The resign is because maybe a moment of giving up. Thr big moyos are there for being invaded. So don't compete for moyos, but rather think in groups (strong, weak) and balance (ofensive, defensive; high, low; corner, side). And esp during fuseki try to identify the joseki and carry them to a certain end, but outside of that, try always first to take big points. Being the best move or not, that counts less, at least aim for them.

Here I resign.

Please tell me what you think of this game. (and also if black is actually 18k... this makes me think I'll never be any better than this) I'm sure I made a lot of blunders and my oponent played in a way that didn't leave much space for good shape and moves that can be explained by principles. Please help me find the few exceptions where I ignored those principles.
Thank you very much, once again for fighting your way through this mess of a game and possibly even have to read things along the way. I didn't include most variations of my own, since they're so obviously wrong, didn't seem worth looking at.]
