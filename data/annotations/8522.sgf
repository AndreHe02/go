C[Well, I'd like to thank you in advance for the review.  I really appreciate it.  I've decided to start playing the 3x3 opening, so....yeah.  Anyway, it kind of surprised me that I lost even after making a seki in the bottom right.  Is there any way I could have gotten a better result in that situation?  During the game, I tried to play the "big" places when I had sente, but I suppose I missed some of them.]

(;W[ql]LB[qk:B][qq:A]C[Tami: I'm only 1k, and I have a lot of doubts about my own game, but I shall try to help you if I can.

The joseki move is to attach at A. 

If you are to play in this direction, maybe one step further would be better. Your move does not accomplish very much with respect to territory or influence.]
;B[qp]LB[qh:B][po:A]C[Now, I would ignore this and treat A as a disposable stone. B would be one possibility.]

C[This is quite threatening, but the right side is not interesting, and I think white should be able to weather an follow up black might play on the top, so I suggest this move is a mistake. White could now take the chance to make a serious attack in the lower left.]
(;W[md]TR[dm][do][eo]C[I understand why you played here, but it looks too slow. You cannot make many points on the top, so instead of playing here for a fifth time, perhaps you should take the risk of defending them against black's follow-up. Black has his own weak group to defend, and you are solid elsewhere on the board, so I suggest two alternatives.

1) Attack the marked weak group (my preferred option)

2) Take a big point, e.g., R11 or D10.];B[dk];W[cl];B[dl]

The only thing I can say with certainty is that sente is, as always, of great importance. The key idea is "Mutual Damage" - instead of just answering the opponent in gote, you should make an equal or greater threat elsewhere, and follow through if the opponent plays his own threat.]

You won this game! White plus 35.5.

Anyway, my advice is to study Life and Death, so that you can see when it's necessary to defend, and when you can take sente.

Also, before you try to capture something, or before you decide to defend something, ask yourself its value. Count not only the points, but try to decide if the stones are doing an important job or just taking up space. A couple of times you went after small stones, e.g., the D14/15 group, when you had more profitable things to try.

Finally, make double sure you mark live/dead/seki stones properly - else you might have another victory accidentally recorded as a defeat!]
