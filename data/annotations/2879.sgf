C[Hi, This game was played at the Milton Keynes (UK) tournament on Sunday 21/09/2003. The game was a Jigo, and took approximately 1.5 hours of playing time.
Please review for Black.

Thanks for reviewing it.];B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dq]C[CG> My normal fuseki pattern as Black, normally I would play C15 to make a shimari, but as W played D3 I decided to make an approach move at d5

I think either of those move are OK in this position.  Just a matter of style.]
;B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dm];W[de];B[cg]C[CG> Perhaps a bit large as an extension, but I know a few of the tight pincer joskei in this position, I'd rather have played c11, but felt comfortable playing this

I think this is OK.  White still owes you a move at F3, so if you can end up with sente here, you should get a good result.]
;W[dg];B[dh];W[eg]
(;B[gd]C[Leaving the cutting point at C12 behind is probably not a good idea.   See the variation for a better way.]
;W[cc]
(;B[dd]C[It is usually not a good idea to bump up against the D15 stone like this.  If you want a strong position around the D17 stone, see the variation.  The D17/D18 stones are short of liberties.]
;W[cd];B[ee];W[ce]C[CG> This isn't joseki :-/, but still looked good to me]
;B[qn]
(;W[nq];B[pj];W[od]
(;B[mc]C[CG> Same again

This is probably OK, but I would play somthing on the right side,]
;W[qc]
(;B[pf]C[CG> I considered Q17, but considered that it would destory either my right or top sides.

This doesn't put enough pressure on white.  You have more stones in this area, so you can fight with confidence.  ignoring the contact play on the R16 stone will give white an easier time in the fight]
;W[kc];B[me];W[ke]
(;B[pc]C[CG> This looks better to me now

I would attack both stones as a group, not just separate them.  You also need to be sure of the connections between your stones.]
;W[pb]
(;B[oc];W[rc];B[rd];W[sd];B[re];W[ob];B[nd];W[mb]
(;B[iq]C[CG> It looked like the last big play on the board, so I jumped for it.

The bottom side is small, so this move isn't urgent.  I think it is better to expand your right side area.]

(;W[fp];B[lq];W[on];B[pl]C[CG> Probably submissive, but it does take territory

It looks good to me.];W[eh];B[di]C[That solves the problem of the cutting point at C21. You should thank your opponent. :-)]
;W[hb];B[gb];W[hc];B[gc];W[hd];B[cb];W[bb];B[he];W[hg];B[rp]
C[This is a big point.  Are you sure the upper left group is alive?]

(;W[qq];B[gr];W[fr];B[ie];W[lc];B[jc];W[jd];B[id];W[jb];B[ic]
;W[ib]C[CG> Round about now I want to play N9, but don't want to cause J3/M3 any grief, so I tried to induce W into forcing me to make that move.

I don't see that playing N9 would hurt the bottom. I think it might actually help a little.]

(;B[mo];W[nh]C[CG> Not quite what I planned :-)]
(;B[ph]C[This is a little small.  If white plays in this area about 10 points will be destroyed.  If you attack the white stone you should be able to get that back an more.]
;W[lg]
(;B[mk]C[CG> W's knight's move at N13 can be cut, I was hoping to be able to come back and make that cut

If white cooperates with you plan, it might be OK. if not, then this move isn't worth very much.

I think it is time to count before moving.  White has about 15 in the upper right, maybe 10 in the upper left. maybe 15 in the lower left, maybe 10 in the lower right. You have maybe 5 in the upper left, maybe 15 on the left side, maybe 5 on the bottom side, and maybe 30 on the right side.  That means that white has about 50 and you have 55.  You are leading, but not by much.  I think the big points are S3, B6, G3, N2 and B14.  You need to try to get as many of them as possible.  I would start with S3 because, I am pretty sure white will respond.  The R3 group might die if he doesn't.   Then N2 will probably also get a response, and then B6 threatens to reduce the lower left.]
;W[ho];B[mg]C[CG> H5 didn't seem to be sente to me, so I went for the cut]

C[CG> Aiming at L13];W[jj];B[ig];W[hh];B[ih];W[kg];B[hf];W[eo]
;B[fm];W[jk];B[rq]C[CG> I remember being told that this was a big pont by a stronger player, and I thought it seemed about due, so ... (especially with W cut off, and with limited eye space)

it is a big point.  A Pro once told me it is worth 17.5 points, but she may have been joking. :-)]
;W[rr];B[qp]C[This is probably not so good right now.  take the N2 point first,  it may not be forcing later.]
;W[pq];B[ei];W[gj];B[gg]C[CG> I liked this move];W[gh];B[gi]
;W[gf];B[hi];W[fg];B[ge]C[CG> I did wish I'd played F14 instead of G15, straight after playing it]
;W[fj];B[dk];W[fi];B[ff]C[ This is too small.  The big points are B14, B6, N3, and G3. Even K5 is worth more and it doesnt threaten anything, it just takes territory.]
;W[bg];B[bh];W[cf];B[ch];W[jp];B[jq];W[ll];B[jm]C[connect is better.]

C[CG> My opponent hesitated for a long while here, I got the feeling he was thinking of R7, but I couldn't see anything

Neither do I.];W[pm];B[qm];W[ln];B[mn];W[kn];B[gp];W[fq];B[go]
;W[jn];B[io];W[in];B[hn];W[ko];B[ip];W[kp];B[kq]C[CG> I did wonder if this was a necessary move, I'm still not sure, but if my opponent could find an evil sequence then I'd lose, so I was perhape a little over protective

If you omit L3, then L2 for white would reduce the bottom center.]
;W[ol];B[pk];W[mr];B[lr];W[mq];B[lp];W[im];B[hk];W[em];B[en]
;W[el];B[ek];W[fl]C[CG> I missed the double atari at F6 when I read out thesequence starting from E7]
;B[fo];W[dl];B[cl];W[fk];B[gl];W[bm]C[CG> I was really tempted to play B6 here, but I was scared of C7,D6,C9, which looked bad for me]
;B[cm];W[bn];B[bl];W[se];B[sf];W[sc];B[rf];W[bf]C[CG> Perhaps I should play h2 soon

How many points is it worth?  Being able to count the value of endgame plays like this will make you much stronger.  Every move you should take an inventory of the big moves and try to play as many as possible.
Set problems like this up on a board and play out both possibilties, and see what the difference is. It is good practice. 

Except for a couple of slow moves, black did well in this game.  Spend more time looking at the whole board, and finding the biggest moves, and you should be able to win games like this easily.]
;B[am];W[ao];B[lm];W[km];B[po];W[oo];B[gg];W[fh];B[of]C[CG> This is not a good endgame move, H2!]
