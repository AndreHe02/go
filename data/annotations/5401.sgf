C[Hi Reviewer, my name is Mokuma and i just started to play Go. I choosed this game, cause this was the longest one (the most of our games ends between the 120th and 150th move). During the hole game i had the feeling of making a lot of mistakes. Both of us played pretty fast, it was more instinct then thinking. I don`t really reviewed the game by myself, cause there was no way for such a rookie like me could do it usefull. I`ll hope you show me where and how big my mistakes was, what (maybe) my  strenghs/weakness are. And try to estimate our ranks. btw I apologies for my english, i am from Switzerland. And of course i would like to thank you for reviewing this game.]

(;B[eo]C[This move seems a little strange.  Later it allows white to close off his corner in sente.  Either just a straight connection or a tenuki seems in order here.]
;W[dh];B[fc];W[cr]C[Here white gets sente because of how you "blocked" earlier.]

(;B[eq]C[In this case you've spent two stones (e3 and e5) to make a connection you could have made earlier with only f4 or just ignored completely and kept sente.]
;W[fm]C[In the mean time, white has used his several moves to secure his corner in sente and make a fairly large left side.]

(;B[gn]LB[db:A][jd:B][pj:C]C[This is a nice idea, keeping your stones connected to the center and picking on white a little, but I think there are larger things open right now.  There is still the right side, and there is also your approach move in the upper left that could use some help.  If you can catch the white stones, this will be very big, but stones can be very hard to catch.

Any of A, B, or C looks useful.];W[ec];B[fd];W[kd]C[Do you see why A or B would have been a nice move previously?  Now the two black stones in the upper left are looking a little strange.  I think white could have pressured them even more by playing one line closer, at K instead of L.]

(;B[gm]C[It's hard for me to judge the value of these moves.  I still like something on the right or something like j17 to make a base for your top stones.]
;W[qf]C[Picture white trying to do this with a black stone at q10 or r10.  It seems much more difficult.]
;B[qj]C[This is good, but I would rather it have been here before white came in.]

C[This seems good.  It keeps the white groups on the right far apart and prepares an attack on both of them.]

(;B[rf]C[This isn't so good.  It either (A) gives up sente, or (B) gives white an eye.

If you want to make sure these stones don't do anything, just drop down to s15.]
;W[rg]C[So if you don't connect, white can take an eye in gote.  That may not help him at this point, but it may later, depending on how things play out.  But by giving white this possibility, you're giving him more options to play.]

(;B[nj]C[This is okay, but it is possible to just cut p10 and be done with it.  Once cut, white can't take the black stones.  See variation.]
;W[oj];B[nk];W[ph];B[ni];W[mj];B[ic]C[This is necessary.

Any time between here and when white plays s11 black can play s11 to kill the white side group.  This would be very big.]
;W[jc];B[cc]C[This gives white a choice, I think.  He can seal that stone in the corner and pick on the g17 group.]

C[I think white should maybe play e15 here and fight.  It's messy, but I think it's better than just letting black life as he does.]
;W[df];B[ee];W[ef];B[ff];W[fg];B[do];W[co];B[dm]C[Nice idea.  I think white may be able to resist and at least make it a fight by playing e7, though.]

;W[no];B[gg]C[Black has the game well in hand now.  The lower left group is nearly dead.  But you have to be careful...there could be a race between q5 group and q8 group.  Who wins?]

(;W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[sb];W[qd];B[ra]C[White was nice to let you get a ko to live.  You have to connect it as soon as possible.]

All in all, black played a good game, though there were some moments when he could have played bigger moves or things that would leave white fewer possibilities.

The r13 group should have been killed when you had the chance.  There were too many moves played with the e3 group in the beginning when there were bigger points on the board.  You left a chance for white to kill the s18 group when you shouldn't have.  Black has a very secure lead, but watching these things better will improve your game for the future.

Looking back on the game one more time, it seems the biggest thing for you to develop is a sense of when to leave a local situation and play something big or when to leave something to play something urgent.  Urgent moves and big moves trump local moves.  The saving or killing of a group is usually urgent (S18 group or R13 group).  In the opening taking big points along a side is usually bigger than playing a little local move with a group that's already alive.  (R10 instead of g6).

As far as a rank goes, it's hard to say.  You seem to have a pretty good sense of what's happening locally and don't make very bad local moves, but the sense of what is biggest on the board needs to be developed some.  Total guess, I would say 15k +/- 3 stones. 

Hopefully this helped.])
