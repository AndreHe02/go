BL[854];W[nq]WL[888];B[pn]C[This moves is OK, but
it would be stronger at R6, thus reducing the impact if white invaded at
R8]BL[849];W[no]WL[865];B[pj]C[Black would be better off invading at K3 or
K4. But for K3 or K4 to work, black would need to have played Q6 at
R6.]BL[824];W[jp]WL[861];B[fd]C[Too high. F17 would be better since it
would offer more options for follow-up moves.]BL[813];W[df]
C[White would be better off playing the pincer at J16. Black's
move at F16 invites the pincer.]WL[801];B[jd]C[Like Q10, this move is high
and easily challenged. For instance, white could play H16 to weaken black
badly.]BL[778];W[dj]C[Ditto for this move.]WL[780];B[jj]C[At this point
black is in the better position.]BL[693];W[fg]WL[711];B[he]
C[If black must
respond, then G14 would be much stronger.  Black could choose to ignore
white and play at O7 to threaten white's area.  As played, black is far too
conservative.]BL[675];W[hg]WL[702];B[jg]BL[667];W[ec]C[It is too early in the game for this. White
would be better off playing at 07 or
P7.]WL[679];B[fc]BL[657];W[eb]WL[678];B[fb]C[Many places on the board are a
lot more valuable than this. There's still 07. And then there are the
various invasion points -- C6 or F6, for
instance.]BL[648];W[om]WL[661];B[pm]BL[609];W[ol]WL[642];B[pl]
C[The bigger problem is the center, not the side. I would
suggest taking the game to white by playing at 09.  By playing at Q8, black
invites white's next move, and it is very costly to
black.]BL[605];W[nj]WL[629];B[oh]BL[582];W[pr]WL[587];B[qq]
BL[578];W[qr]WL[581];B[rq]C[It is not necessary to respond to white here. Invading at C6 or
F3 would be much more profitable.]BL[572];W[pq]C[This is a very small move
for white. Playing at N12 or defending one of the invasion points would be
more profitable.]WL[557];B[cn]BL[541];W[op]WL[556];B[qo]C[If black must respond, then Q5
would make more sense.]BL[522];W[cl]WL[547];B[en]C[Black would be better
off playing at F3, thus setting up a corner invasion at
C3.]BL[515];W[cp]WL[542];B[gm]C[I would have played F4 to reduce white's
area.]BL[504];W[go]WL[522];B[il]C[Black has succeeded in strengthening white and
has won no territory for his effort. Running out to the middle is not the
best tactic
here.]BL[468];W[hj]WL[512];B[mh]BL[394];W[kl]WL[498];B[lj]BL[381]

R17.]WL[201];B[ne]BL[567];W[me]C[White is throwing away
stones.]WL[191];B[mf]C[Black would have been better off at 014. Black
should keep in mind that white needs to create two eyes to live. Black 014
strengthens black and leaves white in the same eyeless shape.]

has now given white 7 points in this one corner. Keep in mind that's 7
points in a game lost by just 10.5 points. Playing E19 is where there are
points to be made for both black and white.]BL[305];W[hp]C[White would be
better off playing F19. Black cannot split white and kill the corner. If
black tried, it would just be another prisoner for
