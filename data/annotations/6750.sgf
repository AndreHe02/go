C[
A: Dear Matt,
The main problems I found in this review were related to reading the status of strong and weak groups, making correct shape, playing a bit too hastly and protecting weak groups.



Despite white being ahead at the beggining, black could have won this game, but gave up many points in the end. White won because he read better. 


Thanks for reading the comments, I hope you find them useful.

I wish you lots of fun playing Go.

All the best,

(;W[hp]TR[pp]C[I actually don't know any pincer joseki, or any joseki at all, so I'm not sure if this is correct. If I played the joseki I do know, I feel black would get too nice of a position (see branch).

A: I think this pincer is not often played at such an early stage. 
Note the black stone in the lower right corner. I don't think it would be easy for white to be succesful playing in an agressive way on the lower side.]

A: I don't know how to answer best this move.];W[hq];B[jp]C[I really don't know what to play in this situation, but feel that splitting his groups is really the only option.

(;W[lo]C[A: I think this move is a bit empty];B[lp];W[kp]C[This move seems bad, but I wanted to secure this group before attacking the g5 stones, which seem weak to me.


A: g5 group has a strong shape now. They have one eye already. Wc4 is alone though and an easy target for black to attack once he gets sente back. For this reason, I think w14 was'nt good.]

;B[jk];W[kl];B[kk];W[mn];B[nn];W[mm];B[nm]C[I became scared for this group, and let myself get sealed in in order to make sure it lived. If I continued to push at N8, black profits too much. This group should be able to live, so I tenuki.]

(;W[qf]C[I don't see the low & high combination pincer in my joseki dictionary, so I suppose this is technically wrong. However, I don't necessarily see how this could end poorly for me unless one of the two stones dies.

Black looks weaker than me here, so I should be able to make use of forcing moves, there's plenty of room to live on the right and I can run to my own stones on the left.


A: W could have also considered jumping out splitting the black group in the center.]
