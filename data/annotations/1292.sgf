C[no2k: I played white in this game. I wanted to play a secure game, but in the end, i lost a whole group. Black builded up a moyo. I thought, it would be possible to break through, and waited for a chance. But in the end, all his groups were secure.
Perhaps you can give me a hint, where i went wrong.];B[do];W[qc]

(;W[dp]C[no2k: I wanted to try somthing new, getting influence without making it black too easy to get the corner.

df: influence means that you plan to take the ouside, and let him get the corner.  Instead, you ended up with a very weak group here.  Having this weak group lost the game for you.

You have to choose between influence and the corner.  It's too greedy to expect to get influence and deny him the corner too, especially when he moved first in the corner.

Since your upper right stone is on 3-3, he can easily get the outside there, so it is a good plan to take the outside yourself elsewhere.]
;B[cp]
(;W[dq]C[df: when you attach and he hane's, you should counter-hane so you can make some shape.

this move makes a heavy group, so maybe it is the losing move.]
;B[cq]
(;W[dr]C[df: this makes the group even heavier.  at least you should hane.]
;B[gq]C[
df: now your 3 stones are heavy and weak.  they have no eyes yet and are almost surrounded.  You can't afford to play somewhere else unless you plan to sacrifice them, and sacrificing them is too big a loss.

Having such a heavy group puts you behind already.]
(;W[iq]C[no2k: Overplay?];B[eo];W[fp];B[hp];W[fo];B[ip];W[jq]
;B[ko]C[df: since your main group is so weak, you have to run.  otherwise, answering on the lower side is huge.]
;W[fm]LB[lp:a]C[no2k: Answering at A seemed to dangerous to me.

df: yes.];B[lq];W[lr];B[mr];W[mq]
(;B[or]C[df: luckily for you, black gets greedy and goes wrong here.]
;W[nr];B[kr];W[kq];B[mo]LB[lp:a]C[no2k: I expected a black move at A.]
;W[lp]C[
df: so you get to keep the lower edge anyway, but
black is thick in the center now.];B[lo]LB[fm:B][or:A]C[no2k: I think this is an acceptable result for white. The resulting black thickness is not massive, and white gets  secure territory.

df: only because black made a big mistake at A.
Since you are out at B, the thickness is not so great, as long as he can't force your weak group to run toward it.  When later he makes your group run in front of that thickness, it becomes worth much more than the territory on the lower edge.]
;W[cn];B[co]
(;W[dm];B[en];W[fn];B[em]
(;W[dl]LB[el:a]C[no2k: Maybe its better to block at A?

df: yes, always block.  that way you can attack the group in the corner.  Once it gets out, there is no attack.]
;B[el];W[cj];B[fl]C[df: now you are cut and he isn't.  If you had blocked, he could still cut here, but his own stones would also be cut.

Now you are in big trouble since your group will have to run in front of his wall.  He will get lots of free moves in the center, and easily build a big moyo.]
;W[hm];B[gl];W[hn];B[ik]C[df: jumping lower is better, since it threatens to cut off three stones.]

(;W[jm];B[in]C[no2k: This seemed to me as a good move. I responded with the solid connection. But i realized later that this move also connects the two black groups. How should i have connected in a better way?

df: once you jump high like this, he has this forcing move, so he is conencted.  better to jump lower.]
;W[im];B[kl]C[df: ouch.  looks like your group might die now.  even if it lives, it will be gote for you, with little territory and he will solidify the outside.]
;W[cr];B[fr];W[fq]
(;B[gr]C[df: slow and unneccessary move.  black should go for the kill now.]
;W[bq];B[bp];W[bs]
(;B[km];W[ar]C[no2k: This doesn't look attractive. I secured my group barely but permitted black to connect all his groups. The  white stone in the upper right looks very lonely now.

He let you live to get the big moyo.   Your white group lives with just a few points of territory while he got about 5 moves on the outside.  This was a huge loss for you.  This weak white group is the reason you lost the game.]
;B[pd]
(;W[qe]C[no2k: I decided to give up the corner, but to get influence on the right side.

you don't have to give up the corner.  he can;t stop you from coming out to the side anyway.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[pe];W[qf];B[pc];W[pf]C[no2k: I was happy to look into the open space hoping to neutralize blacks central moyo.

But you give up a  lot of points in the corner.
You should have kept about 10 points in the corner, but now black will get about 15 points instead.  so you need to reduce the moyo by 25 points to break even on this trade.]

;W[bj];B[ei];W[ai]C[still, black got some more influence in the center.]
;B[pj]
(;W[pi]LB[qi:a]C[no2k: Better at A?

yes.  avoids a difficult fight, or giving up a stone.];B[qi]

(;W[oj];B[pk];W[qh];B[ri];W[rh];B[rj]C[this way is very dangerous.  you don't have two eyes yet, and it will be hard to run away.]
;W[ni]C[no2k: Later in the game i realized, that this move left too much bad aji. But even without this mistake, i dont't think that this is an acceptable result for white. Black took considerable territory on the side, and white got nearly nothing.

df: Solid connection is better.  Black got territory on the right side, and sente to surround the top, so he gets the lead in territory here.  Before this, territory was about even, but black was thicker.]

LB[ng:b][ok:a]C[no2k: I think now A would have been bigger.

df: yes, or b first, to secure your group.  he probably will answer b.]
;B[ok]C[df: now black is well ahead in territory, and is still thicker.]
;W[hl]C[df this is small, only 2 point.  save it for later, since it is a good ko threat.]
;B[hk];W[ej];B[fj]
(;W[gf]C[df: this jump is a too dangerous since there are so many black stones nearby.  Hold back one andyou can still come in pretty far sice his 3 stones below have a cut you can aim at.]

;B[oh]C[no2k: Now this move is crashing.

df: this is a very good move for black.  He missed chances to kill your other two groups, but this one must die now.]
