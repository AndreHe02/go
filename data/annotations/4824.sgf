AB[dp][pd]C[

DC:
Overall, it was a good game; Most problems were in the middle game.
You have some tendencies to force white to harm you; This occured several times in the game.
I would recommend you to look carefully before you play, especially if white has split two of your groups.
You should also look for ways to attack globally and to attack while making profit(variations demonstrating this are included).]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[cf];B[fd]
(;W[ci]C[What are some responses to this? I was a little unsure how to proceed

DC: If white jumps here instead of sliding to B16, B C15 protects the corner while making white overconcentrated.]
;B[ce]C[Since white ignored this, should I squeeze and then invade his group immediately with a play like c9 or should it wait?

DC:White should probably reply to this move to strengthen himself. Black C9 is good and also a move like B14 which shows white he isn't alive.]

(;W[fq]
(;B[gp]C[DC: This move is too risky; don't strike so close to an approaching stone unless you have read it out. It would have been better with some more black stones in the area or if it was connected to D4.
A shoulder hit such as G4 incurs alot of close fighting and if white manages to split black it would not be nice.
Black has several alternatives here; C6 is probably the least greedy and most safe, but if you want to try things C7 and C9 may be useful. I would not respond at H3(check variations).]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[go]
(;B[hp];W[eo];B[fn];W[ep]C[DC: This is a tough position for black. The 4-4 stone is greatly weakened, and there's G5 to deal with. Black is split into three weak groups.]

(;B[do]C[DC: This move forces w to hurt black's other group(because w follows at E6). I would instead play at D3.]
;W[en];B[gn]C[DC: Black would have like to capture w in a net; a ladder is very dangerous if white plays a breaker. But there is no alternative.
If w plays at H6 black has no eyes either, so the G4 move hadn't ended up very well.
Black would do well to remove the G5 stone off the board as quickly as possible.]
;W[hr]
(;B[dn]C[kinda pulled this one outta my hat, but I liked my result, is there any way white could have played differently to make me regret not following a joseki?]
;W[em]
(;B[dl]C[DC: This move is risky. Black is overlooking major weaknesses.]

(;W[fl];B[jd]C[DC: I feel this move is ignoring alot of what's going on around the board.]

(;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[lc];B[kb]C[Is this move too small? would it be better to extend up?

DC: This move is OK. I would prefer K17 instead to leave less potential for trouble but L18 looks fine.]
;W[dr]
(;B[cq]C[Other possibilities would be to attack C11 or M17.]
;W[qk];B[qi];W[ok];B[nq]C[DC: This is very hard to play; If white splits O3 from H4, which seems very likely, I wouldn't expect both to survive. Perhaps a better strategy would be to first take care of the G6 group.
Once it lives there will probably still be the chance of R3.]

(;W[oq];B[np];W[pn];B[jq]C[Too good for black, white just strengthened him and pushed his two weak groups together. Unless white cuts black somehow, black has gained alot here.]
;W[nf]C[DC: At this point, black is leading by a good margin. 
Here I would be tempted to respond at O13 and to try cancel out the breaker, but since black is ahead it would probably be too greedy and will not help the aji at G5 at all.]
;B[ho];W[bl]C[Here black must block at B7 or B6 and then descend at C2 to make life.]
;B[cl]
(;W[bk];B[bm];W[hd]C[DC: This move is slightly risky for white; white has three weak groups(which is already dangerous!) but also on the same side. Attacking here will probably force black to weaken both other groups.
For example, if b gets to play K14 or E13 or something while chasing white, white will have to decide which group to help; not an easy dilemma.]

(;B[hc]C[What are some other possible responses to this?

DC: This move is in most cases not very good; White will hane one of the sides and then connect which weakens one of the black groups tremendously.]
;W[ic];B[gc];W[id];B[ib];W[jc];B[jb];W[kc]C[DC: Black let white connect two very weak groups.
White is happy; Life, and a wall.];B[oh]C[DC: This move is usually played at P11, for a straight jump towards the centre, but this is ok too.]
;W[ig];B[mh];W[lp]C[DC: Dangerous for white, I don't see much profit coming from this.]
