RE[W+32.5]

AB[dg][gj][jg]C[I was playing black in this game the problem I have is aggressive/defensive
I end up being Aggressive when I need to be Defensive and Defensive
when I need to be Aggressive.  Please Advise in this area   M. David Wilson   Your main problem is opening.  Go is a game about sharing and
you should alternate taking corners with your opponent, instead
of responding to his corner plays immediately.   Eric];W[jk]
;B[jj]LB[kd:C][cd:B][ck:A]C[Most of your problems later in the game are caused by the disadvantages
due to your opponent taking (eventually) all four corners.  Instead
of 2 in response to white 1, you should take another corner with
something like A, B, or C.];W[kj]LB[ji:B][ij:A]C[White 3 is a solid move.  After this, Black should extend at
A or B.  This makes black stronger in this area.];B[dj]C[Taking a corner with 4 is good.]
;W[dc];B[gg]C[This wasn't a necissary move.  It does solidify the center, but
more points could be made by taking the remaining corner, which
white does next.];W[jc];B[jd]C[This move, in response to white at the 3-4 point, invites whites
next move.  This is ok, though, as long as you extend this lonley
piece with black 10.];W[kd];B[dd]MA[ce][de]C[As a response move to 3-4 points (like white's three corner moves)
playing another space back or the knight's move (see X's) is
better, as it doesn't allow the follow-up move white has been
using on you.  This would be true for all three of your approach
moves in this game.];W[cd]LB[ij:X][ji:X][je:X][id:X][ed:X][de:X]
C[At this point, white has you in the same bad formation in three
corners.  An extention (marked X) would probably be best.];B[ce]
C[This spreads you a little thin and allows white's next move.]
;W[ed];B[de];W[bd];B[be];W[hk]LB[ek:X][fk:X][gk:X]C[After this, the best reponse would probably be to protect your
corner with one of the marked moves.];B[hj];W[gk];B[ik];W[il]
;B[ij];W[kk]C[Again, at this point you have a chance to mak a move protecting
your lower left corner.];B[ee];W[ec];B[fd];W[ck]C[With a 3-3 invasion to a 4-4 point, unless you have strategically
located helping stones, the invader can always live in the corner.
Keeping this in mind, your response to white 27 is good.];B[cj]
;W[dk];B[ej]LB[id:A]C[You didn't really need to do this.  There are better moves on
the board, like A.];W[je];B[id];W[ic];B[hd];W[fc];B[ad]C[This was a good move, as it required immediate response from
white, and leaves you with sente.];W[bc]LB[ac:A]C[White could have played at A.]
;B[ac]C[Continuing here is good because white needs to respond and you
will end with sente.];W[ab];B[ae];W[cb];B[hc]LB[gc:E][gd:D]
[ki:B][kf:A]C[Better than this offensive move would be A or B.  Instead of
42, D or E would be similar but better as it would protect you
from white's atari at D.];W[hb]C[White missed the chance to atari here.]
;B[gc]C[Good, in this area.];W[gb];B[ie];W[ke];B[jf]LB[lf:C]
[ki:B][lh:A]C[A jump into white's potential territory would be better here.
Something like A, B, or C.];W[ek]C[White should have done something to seal up the right side.]
;B[fj]C[Again, the right side is more important.];W[fk];B[bk]
C[This is ok, but you lose sente.];W[bl];B[al]LB[bj:C][aj:B]
[ak:A]C[This double hane is bad, and I'm sure you understand why.  A,
B, or possibly C is the right move here.];W[bj]LB[bi:A]C[A is better than your actual move.]
;B[aj];W[ak];B[ai];W[am];B[bi]C[This worked out ok for you anyway.]
;W[bk];B[kf]C[This was a solid move, but slow.  You want to get into white's
territory as far as possible.];W[lh]C[This is a good move for white.]
;B[lg]LB[ki:A]C[This move might be better at A.];W[ki];B[jh]
;W[le];B[kh]C[The next couple moves are fine and pretty standard endgame moves.]
;W[li];B[mh];W[mi];B[mg];W[lf];B[mf];W[me];B[ji]LB[kg:A]C[Of course, A was better.]
;W[kg];B[lg];W[mg];B[kg]C[Excluding a few mistakes, your play was fine for the second half
of the game.  Unfortunately, the game was lost in the first twenty
moves.  Your problem isn't so much offense/defense but more of
an opening game problem.  The vague, subtle mistakes from the
opening had repercussions that troubled you for the rest of the
game.])
