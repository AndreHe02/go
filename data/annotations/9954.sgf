C[B: Hi, I'm Bart and I'll try to review your game. My comments start with B:]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[op]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I did not expect white to approach yet in the lower right.

B: it's possible, white will probably not finish the joseki to take sente and play in the corner later]

(;B[pn]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I wonder if I should have instead responded at d4

B: possible, white will probably then take most of the corner]
;W[qq];B[pp];W[pq];B[oo];W[np];B[no];W[dp]C[B: as expected, white doesnt play on N4 or M4 to finish the joseki but plays in the corner. Not a problem for you, because now you have sente]
;B[fq]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought if I threatened his lower right corner here, I might be able to bounce back towards the lower right stronger.

B: good approach];W[gp]C[DastardLee [16k\]: Not so much lol. :(

B: you can still follow that plan, see variation.]
(;B[mp]SQ[fq]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I am not loving my stairstep down shape in the lower right, but I wanted to pressure o4 and p4

B: yes, the idea is good, although you might want to strengthen your marked stome first. See previous variation.]
;W[mq];B[gq]C[B: good];W[hp];B[lp]C[B: not so good, better play H3 yourself]
;W[hq]C[B: now white closes you in];B[fp]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought cutting him would be fruitful and maybe give me a chance to survive since I am under pressure at my f3 group

B: yes, that's one of the options, the other is to go towards the corner. And I think E4 is better because that puts pressure on the D4 stone.]
;W[fo]
(;B[gr]C[DastardLee [16k\]: Go under?

B: always better that G2. But better make some space on the left side. See variations.]
;W[hr];B[hs];W[is]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I probably should not have played at h1 as I gave up initiative

B: yes, and you are left with a very small group with little room...]
;B[gs]LB[ep:1][eq:2][fr:3][fs:4]C[B: only four liberties for 6 stones.]
;W[jr];B[lq]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I wasn't sure how to keep pressing here, but I thought curving down would be good, I thought it might threaten to bisect his groups near h and near o

B: white will probably respond, but see previous comment: your left group needs attention (e.g. D3)]
;W[mr];B[lr];W[nr];B[oq]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I figured he was safe there, but I wanted to make him lumpy. :D

B: he played O2 to protect against this sort of moves.];W[nq]
;B[dq]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I am going to see if I can survive in the lower left corner

B: phew. If white played there first you would be in trouble.]
;W[cq];B[ep]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I either threaten to go out at e5 and run to keep group alive, or I go down at d2 if he blocks e5

B: good.];W[do]
(;B[cr]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought this might give me more space

B: see your own comment earlier: you wanted to get out, so probably better to go on with that. See variation.]
;W[dr]C[DastardLee [16k\]: In retropsect, not the wisest choice. I should have played d2 instead of c2]
;B[eq];W[br];B[eo]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought if I pressured f5 he might let me get out at e6

B: yes];W[fn];B[en]C[B: and you're out :-)];W[em]SQ[do]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought if i go d6 it might pressure d4 and d 5

B: always good to go though the knights move made by the two marked white stones]
;B[dn];W[co]
(;B[dm]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought going up was better than over as his lower corner group appears alive.

B: see variations.];W[el]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I am hoping at some point I can make mischief w/ his cut points at g5 and f7, but I am worried he is building a long, inward facing formation

B: see previous variation, white now fixes this problem at F7.]
;B[dl];W[ek]LB[bm:B][gm:A]C[B: and you push him from behind, making his group even stronger. Area A is now strong white, and B is still open, so if you do not get around to play there, your group is still lacking eye space.]
;B[rq]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought my d8 group had enough liberties so I would attack him at s3 to push him down and make him respond.

B: see previous comment, I think your D8 group is still in a bit of trouble.]
;W[rr]
(;B[rp]C[DastardLee [16k\]: But I see I gave up initiative by playing s3. Perhaps I should have played r13 instead

B: yes, or B7! And before playing S4, you can throw in at R2 to make use of your P3 stone to get a bit more on the right part of the corner, see variation.]
;W[sr];B[go]C[DastardLee [16k\]: Not a good play by me. I thought I could go right and try to pressure his small group on the bottom middle or I could go up and pressure the two stones at f5-6 but now I see my stone was weak there.

B: see earlier comment. White is strong there. B7 is important.]
;W[gm]C[B: if white was afraid of the cutting stone, better to play H6 to secure it.]

(;B[ho]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I wonder if I should have played g6 instead as it would have been a free move for me because he would have to respond at f7

B: true, but it would have taken away one of your own liberties as well. Better play H6 straight away then. See variation.]
;W[io];B[hn]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I should have abandoned this group and not played a stone.

B: yes];W[im];B[in]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought I could cause mischief by playing k5 next but I probably should have regrouped elsewhere

B: yes, I dont see this working.];W[jn];B[jo];W[ip];B[jp]C[DastardLee [16k\]: He was connected, no point in chasing him...
DastardLee [16k\]: He is going to kill my g6 group and get life anyhow

B: correct.];W[hm];B[er]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought I could get one eye here and the other later near d8

B: yes];W[ds];B[es];W[cs]
(;B[dk]C[B: I'd prefer around B7. Then you close the bottom and have room enough for an eye.]

(;W[dj];B[cj];W[di];B[ci];W[cg]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I did not want to press to c12 and make him respond as I want to try to poke through that hole later from the right]
;B[cn];W[bo];B[bn]C[I was probably safe enough to not play this stone and pivot elsewhere, maybe at f17 or r13

B: yes, but this is big and you dont need to worry about white monkey jumping in later on.]
;W[qf];B[kn]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I figured he would respond here then I could reposition

B: ok. if you play around R11 after that.];W[jm];B[km];W[qi]
C[DastardLee [16k\]: I should have played my l7 stone at q12 instead

B: yes, I think so too.];B[ph];W[qh]
(;B[pi]SQ[oe][of][og][oh][oi][nm][om][pm][qm][rm][sm]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I am hoping to get a wall here down and towards my large bottom area

B: your walls would be facing different directions, and white has room enough to live at the side, negating your lower wall. See variation for an alternative.]
;W[pj];B[oj];W[pk]SQ[rf][sf][rg][sg][rh][sh][ri][si][qj][rj]
[sj][qk][rk][sk]C[B: white is making more room];B[ok];W[pl]
;B[ol];W[qm]LB[of:A][mj:B]C[B: and now closes off his territory. This is large, and you didnt get your wall around A, but around B. Which is not as good because white is strong on the left side of B.]

(;B[pm]LB[pf:A]C[B: better fix point A.];W[rm];B[kl]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I think I should have tried  to play k8 or k16, depending what he does

B: see previous comment. In my opinion, Q14 is better.];W[pg]
;B[og];W[of];B[ng]C[But, now I am stuck preventing his intrusion

B: yes. And white gets stronger.];W[nc]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I didnt try to save my corner here, I think I should have.

B: yes, the corner is still big.]
(;B[nf]C[I should have played maybe p15

B: no, then white cuts through your stones. See variation.]
;W[oe];B[ne];W[od]
(;B[nd]C[B: you know white will play P17. Better to play a little lighter. See variation.]
;W[oc]
(;B[ld]C[DastardLee [16k\]: Probably too small of a move, should go larger or threaten upper left

B: see earier variation. And after the exchange you made, N17 might be better.]
;W[gc]
(;B[jd]C[B: that is a bit close to M16. See variation.];W[ki]

(;B[jl]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought if I moved left I could cap his l11 stone later

B: good idea. But this move is a bit slow. Better play J9 then.]
;W[ik];B[jj]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I think he shouldn't have played that stone, now he seems to be cut]
;W[ji];B[ij]SQ[ji][ik]C[B: well, it seems you get through the knights move again (marked white stones). Looks good.]
;W[ih];B[ii]C[B: don't strengthen white unless you use it.]
;W[jg]
(;B[fh]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought this was enough space to box him in

B: I think it's too far away from both sides. D12 will be cut and J11 is too far away. G11 would have been a better move, I think. Or get into the corner while you still can.

B: maybe you didnt see the corner play, so I'll give the sequence now, because later on white is stronger there and you cannot get into the corner anymore (although I scolled further through the game and saw you tried, which is good attitude). For further reading, see sensei library on this invasion -- http://senseis.xmp.net/?Butterfly#toc1]
;W[gh];B[dh]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I figure he lets me connect or he gets threatened at his two weak stones at d10-11]
;W[ch];B[ej]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I figure he cant connect to his lower group]
;W[ei];B[fj]C[I have misread this exchange

B: yes.];W[eh]C[DastardLee [16k\]: hmmmm];B[fi]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I should have extended at d12 instead]
;W[eg];B[fg]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I wanted to still try and block his left and right from connecting]
;W[hf];B[hi]C[DastardLee [16k\]: Poke?

B: it connects.];W[hh]
(;B[gi]C[I probably should have not given up initiative here.

B: and no need to, your previous move already connects. See variation.]
;W[ff]C[B: white is closing the gate.];B[gg]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought I would eat into his eye potential here, but it is a really small move and I should have played elsewhere

B: yes];W[gf]C[B: he responds, so you get another chance.];B[if]
C[DastardLee [16k\]: I don't like this move and am not sure why I did it, honestly

B: me neither :-)];W[hg]C[B: but white reponds again, so you can still play the big move.]
;B[ig]C[B: ouch. Only bump your head if your cut (so with a stone at H12)]
;W[ie]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I should have played up, not down

B: or not there at all. Maybe you were hoping to cut at E14 or something?]
;B[jf];W[id];B[jq]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought this would threaten his group's eyes

B: but you forgot about your four stones in atari.];W[gn]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I figured he would do that

B: and that makes two eyes there.];B[fl]C[B: so no use to take away an eye there.]
;W[gk];B[fk];W[fm];B[gl];W[hk];B[iq];W[ir]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought I might be able to kill him at h5 or h6 but I don't think my reading is good enough to be sure.

B: no, that doesnt work. Although I think you can read it out. Only two moves to consider, see variations.]

(;B[kg]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I think this was an ill considered move because it forces him to do something he probably wanted to do anyways

B: it's more that it is a small move compared to other moves still around]
;W[jh];B[mi]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I felt like this area was weak and I hoped I could cap his stones

B: well, it protects your area, but N17 protects more points.]
;W[lj];B[kj]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I wanted to make sure my group near h10 didn't get cut off]
;W[li];B[lk];W[mj];B[ni]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I figured forcing him down was better because it my down is stronger than my right]
;W[mk];B[ml];W[lg]C[DastardLee [16k\]: Ouch
DastardLee [16k\]: I should have fixed l14

B: but that is all quite small, compared to other moves like N17]
;B[kf];W[mh];B[nh];W[lf];B[le];W[lb]C[B: this is a big move.]
;B[mc]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought about playing n18 instead but didn't know how it would go

B: N18 wont work, so this is the best response.];W[mb];B[jb]
C[DastardLee [16k\]: I wanted to try to avoid getting cut out from the top left]
;W[ib];B[ic];W[hc];B[jc];W[ha];B[mg];W[lh];B[kb];W[lc];B[md]
;W[kc]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I think the game is pretty much over but I continued to still get practice because this player was very challenging for me and I was enjoying the match

B: good attitude.];B[ke];W[bi];B[bj];W[ai];B[aj];W[bg]C[B: it's a shame white is now stronger, so I dont think the corner play is possible anymore.]
;B[sn]C[DastardLee [16k\]: i think this was the wrong move. I should have played maybe r6 as I could get a little territory
DastardLee [16k\]: now he will cut me];W[rn];B[ro];W[sm];B[so]
;W[sq];B[ao];W[ap];B[an];W[bq];B[ms];W[or];B[qn];W[qk]LB[qf:B]
[qk:A]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I think his lower right looks weak but...

B: white played A and B to protect against all cuts and tricky plays you might consider :-) So I think he's pretty safe there.]
;B[nk]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought the point would help me]
;W[ns];B[ls];W[kr];B[kq];W[ks];B[ps]C[DastardLee [16k\]: In retrospect, I think the corner was safe

B: yep. But as long as white responds, you're not losing points.]
;W[pr];B[jk];W[ka];B[ja];W[la];B[ia];W[hb];B[je]C[DastardLee [16k\]: The upper left and upper/right are going to kill me

B: yes, I'm afraid that is so.];W[mf];B[nj];W[na];B[cc]C[DastardLee [16k\]: I thought I would try a c17 attack, I was hoping I could somehow go towards my stone at d12 or hit some cut points at e114 ot try to get down near a13

B: see earlier comments.];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce]C[DastardLee [16k\]: He had too much strength there

B: yes];B[be];W[bf];B[af];W[bd];B[bc];W[ae];B[ac];W[cb];B[bb]
;W[db];B[ad];W[be];B[ca];W[da]C[DastardLee [16k\]: Dang];B[df]
;W[dg];B[tt]C[I think i did a lot wrong in this game, but three (3) things spring to mind:
1. I should have attacked the upper left at f18 when I had the chance as the upper lef tturned into a huge territory for white
2. I should not have let my upper right corner go as this turned into the other major point center for white.
3. I squandered too many moves on inconsequential moves, small moves, or moves on dead stones. If I would have shifted those stones to more productive areas perhaps the game would have been closer.

B: 1, yes. 2, yes, although I think that had more to do with the position of your walls. 3, true, but that is the hardest part of the game: to see when it's still important to respond and when to tenuki. Al in all, I hope the review helped you a bit. Keep on playing!]
