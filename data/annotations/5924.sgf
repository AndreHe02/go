C[We played this game and decided toghether to get a review. Thanks for your help, Mirco.

We add some question in the game. In this period i study the end game, so i would really appreciate some commmts on it.


Dudzik: There were a few mistakes in the endgame, certainly, but almost all of the important places in this game were in the middle game.  The opening was quite alright, I think.

Black made a few very slow moves at crucial times, so white simply made more this game.  I also recommend that both players work hard to improve their reading.  Solving a lot of life and death problems will make it easier to make fast decisions about the safety of groups--which was VERY important in this game. (as in all games)  It will also help with a sense of shape.

If you're looking for more specific comments in future reviews, please direct questions to the reviewer, as having to interpret comments and variations made between the players decreases the time that can be spent reviewing.]

;B[pl]LB[pk:A]C[Dudzik: A is much simpler, and it builds the right side.]

;W[cq]LB[cl:A]C[Dudzik: I think that white should invade at A, or he'll lose the chance.  But I am not sure.]
;B[dl]C[Dudzik: Black turns his weakness into perfect shape.]
;W[pj];B[pk];W[qh];B[lq]C[Dudzik: At first I thought this move was small, but the follow-up invasion is very severe.  So it's sente.]
;W[jo];B[ip];W[jp];B[gp]LB[jo:B][lq:A]C[Dudzik: You are invading after forcing white to strenghten himself with the A-B exchange.  I'm not sure if it's wise.  You could have invaded without playing A at all.]
;W[ho]LB[go:A][gq:B]C[Dudzik: There's a lot of possibilities here--but surely you can't expect black to passively connect?  Playing A or B seems more promising to connect your stones.]
;B[fq]C[Dudzik:White seems divided--it's very painful.];W[eq]
;B[go];W[gq];B[hq];W[gr];B[hn]LB[hr:A]C[Dudzik: Wrong.  Black needs to force again at A first.  Now if white plays A, he is connected.]
;W[io]TR[df][cj][ok][dl][om][cn][np]C[Dudzik: It's important not to miss a chance to connect in this situation.  Black has a lot of influence around, so if white gets a weak group, it will be very difficult.]
;B[fo];W[fr];B[hp];W[eo]LB[hr:A]C[Dudzik: Connect!  This move is small.]
;B[en]LB[hr:A]C[Dudzik: You missed the last chance to cut at A.  It's nice to build a small moyo on the left, but you could have taken control of the game by attacking the 5 white stones.]
;W[hr];B[do];W[rf];B[pb];W[ne];B[rc];W[oh];B[lc]TR[ne]C[Dudzik: This is the second time black has forced white to strengthen himself before invasion.  After the marked move, this invasion is not so easy.]

LB[lh:A]C[Dudzik: The ladder works for white, so this does not really work.  The clever net at A is much harder to read out, but seems to work also.]

this move
Quest [6k\]: i liked your move there...
mircofanti [6k\]: i won here

Dudzik:  Probably force/kill black at A first is better.  But in any case, black's corner is now horribly weak and he should defend it.]
