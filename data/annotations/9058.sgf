AB[pd][dp];W[pq]C[Thanks for reviewing my game! I played B and lost. Could you please point out my mistakes?]
;B[cd];W[fc]C[Actually you don't see moves like this one a lot. 
Usually it has a strategical purpose ( the pincer isn't that good anymore! ), but in this case I think your opponent just wanted to confuse you and hoped you'd do a mistake since it's a handicap game.]

(;B[df]TR[be][ce][bf][cf][bg][cg]C[Please tell me weather these opening moves are correct.


C16 and D14 are wide open at the bottom not really safe, if an enemy's stone finds it's way there ;)

A lot of complicated stuff can happen here ( see variations ), we wouldn't want that to happen when we're playing safe right?]

(;W[cb];B[gp];W[od]C[And again a move you usually won't see this early in a game.
I think your opponent is still trying to trick you, because of the handicap.]

(;B[oe]C[I had no clue what to play here.

Seems alright, can get complicated though,]

(;B[og];W[ng]
(;B[jd]C[Is this a good move or is there a better one?

That's actually a little bit daring and kind of aggressive.
Why do you want to jump into your opponent's potential territory, while there is still so much unused space on the board?

Your opponent was probably really happy to see you make this move. In a normal handicap game the better player ALWAYS wants to pick up a fight, because it's most likely that the weaker player's reading isn't as good as the stronger one's. ( well, at least I think that is what's happening in most handicap games and you'll see a lot of ridiculous moves made by white )]

White's evtension is rather useless without a shimari at R5/Q5/ or somewhere around there-]

(;B[iq]C[Small move. Not really a lot of points to gain here.]
;W[jq]
(;B[gm]C[Correct?

Seems to be unimportant right now. The left is more interesting.]
;W[qm]C[How could have I prevented white from getting so strong in the corner?

Now white is happy ( even though R7 is a little bit too much in my oppinion.. ), showed variations at move 68,69 and 71.]
