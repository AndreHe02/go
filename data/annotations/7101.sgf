C[Hello, this is a game I played on KGS while preparing for the ING school tourney.  This guy is 3k and I didn't think I'd do so well.  Can you help me? Tell me alternatives I could have made.  I suck at middle game too.  I need some tips.  Also, can you give me YOUR OPINION on what you think my strength is?  I just wanted to know, based off of this game.  Thanks in advance!

Howdy ! :)

My name is Philipp and I play on KGS as "Lebertran", so if you have other questions about this review feel free to ask me
First of all, it would be helpful when you delete the chat before sending to GTL.
Also, some specific questions to some moves you didn`t understand would be helpfull too! :)
Now I can only show you some mistakes i found .
Please try to use these tips for your next game you want to send to GTL. It would be easier for the reviewer and more attractive for you. :)

The opening was ok for you but you are right with the middle game:). You must also learn to be more flexible in playing and try to omit unimportant moves.

I hope you enjoy the review! :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq]

You must connect the F17 stone with your group.

This is only a rough estimation. You shouldn`t count accurately at this stage of the game. Just compare the groups. 
The estimation shows that you are leading and it`s your turn now.
The black O9 group is save, so you can play tenuki now.
A and B are very big points now.];B[ol]C[P8 is useless, O9 is save!]

All in all you must play more flexible. It`s one of your biggest problem in this game, there are too many useless and slow moves.
Try to use the estimation technique in your games and decide how to play. It`s very helpful!

Your strenght is about 6k-5k i think, if you play more flexible you would be stronger.

If you have any questions send me a message on KGS (my account is "Lebertran")

Bye bye :)])
