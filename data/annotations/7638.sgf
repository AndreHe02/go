(;W[eq]LB[ep:A]C[reid: The joseki move here is at A.  See variation

The hane is an overplay.];B[bq]C[reid: B3 is the correct response to the hane.]
;W[ep];B[bp];W[dn];B[cm]LB[dm:D][co:A][do:B][kq:C]C[reid: Black should pull back at A instead.  After white B, black is alive, so he can destroy the outside thickness with C.  White still has a potential problem at D.]
;W[dm];B[bl];W[bk]LB[bo:A];B[ck];W[dl];B[bj];W[bm];B[ak];W[bn]
C[reid: black ends with a fairly strong position while white gets a very strong outside position.  This is a very good result for white.]
;B[bo];W[co];B[er]LB[lp:A]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: I was quit happy about this result as black. E2 is probably a mistake by me, since the group is already alive. If I tenuki, is E17 biggest point? Or should i play L3 instead?

reid: If black is going to play E2, then exchanging B5 for C5 is not neccessary.  After B5, black is alive, and he doesn't need to play E2.

Black could nullify the white wall somewhat with a move around A, but white E2 would be sente, so black needs to be cautious.]
;W[fr];B[dr];W[ed]LB[mq:A]
(;B[ec]LB[df:A]C[reid: The joseki with black A would let the black stones work together better,  See variation.]
;W[dd];B[dc];W[ce];B[cc];W[df]LB[fd:A]C[reid: Joseki here is for white to play at A.  When black hanes at A, white cannot find a good response.]
;B[cg]LB[fd:A]C[reid: black A is the vital point.];W[bf];B[fd]
C[Wyermsu [1k\]: Is F16 to greedy, should i play around E10 maybe to help my weak group?

reid: The black C9 group has good eye shape, so the white stones are in a bit of trouble.

White would do better to play D14 at F16 and allow black to connect along the second line (B15) if he so chooses.  White wants to concentrate on central thickness anyway.

For black, F16 is a vital point that squishes white's stones into inefficient shape.]
;W[fe];B[ge]LB[gd:A]C[reid: pulling back with A is good enough for black.]
;W[gd];B[fc];W[ff];B[gf];W[gg]C[reid: The hane is an overplay.  Just extending to F13 is necessary, but the shape with D16, E16 and D14 is very ineffecient.  F16 was vital for both sides!]
;B[fg]C[reid: This cut is severe!];W[ef]C[reid: It is very painful for white to have to make this shape,]
;B[hg]LB[fh:A][gh:B]C[reid: black could mount a severe attack with A.  However exchanging H13 for white B makes the attack much more difficult.  Black does not need to make the atari with H13 since the ladder doesn't work in either direction.]
;W[gh];B[hh];W[gi]C[reid: black is pushing white from behind, and white is building up strength to use against the black C9 stones.  It should have been white under attack here but now black is on the defensive.]
;B[ej]LB[bh:A][ci:B][cj:C]C[reid: It looks like black can live with A (if white B, black C).  If black is alive here, then the black F13 cutting stone is a severe threat.

Black E10 runs out, but there is really nowhere to run to.  White is too strong around F6.]
;W[ci]C[reid: white strikes at the vital point.];B[cj]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: I couldn't find any good answer to C11..]
;W[bi]LB[di:A]C[n.];B[di];W[bg];B[ch]LB[dh:A]C[reid: Black A looks like it would be more severe.]

;W[eg];B[hk]LB[de:K][cf:J][dh:I][ih:H][ii:F][ji:G][gj:B][hj:C]
[ij:E][gk:A][ik:D]C[reid: This is very risky for black.  White can start a ko with white A, black B, white C.  Black cannot connect because the ladder at D is good for white.  Black must atari at E instead, and white starts the ko.  If white wins the ko, the black D10 group will certainly die.

White has at least two ko threats at F (black responds with G) and H.  Black doesn't seem to have any ko threats.]
;W[ii];B[gk]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: Right now I'm feeling I'm doing good. F9 group is abit weak, but it's diving right into white's potenial mojo.]
;W[hd];B[kf]LB[ie:A]C[reid: black A would be better shape and also reverse sente.]
;W[jd];B[jk];W[ki]LB[li:B][mi:C][lj:A]C[reid: the game gets pretty wild after this.  There are four unsettled groups, and either side could have inflicted grave damage several times.  For example, black could play A, white B, black C now and the white K11 group is almost captured already.]
;B[jh]C[reid: This move is aji-keshi.  It may be sente, but white gets more out of the exchange than black does (black K12 has very little value).]
;W[ji];B[ld]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: Black should probably peek at J15 first? Since it's sente.]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[lc]LB[ke:A][le:B][jf:I][lf:C][jg:J][kg:D][lg:E]
[mg:H][ih:K][kh:G][lh:F]C[reid: here, white could start an all-or-nothing ko with white A, black B, and on to white K.]

;B[kg];W[ih];B[ig];W[mf]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: Here i felt I had won the game, white is almost dead 3 places.. And black only have M13 weak group.

reid: Yes, tryinng to save M14 is asking for too much.  Hoever, black H9 is not completely alive either.]
;B[mg];W[nf];B[ng];W[of];B[ph]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: Is M10 better for black? Seems to kill middle group.

reid: yes.];W[lj]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: M10, really good move by white. Puts pressure on black's F9 group, and also threatens the push at P13 cut.]
;B[ni];W[ll];B[im]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: P16 here for black seems to kill top.. But I was too afraid for F9 group, that it would run into to much trouble.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[pc]LB[qd:B][oe:A]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: I had alot of problems finding out how to deal with this crosscut.. And looses top completly in the process. How should I play here?

reid: A looks safe.  B is more aggressive - perhaps black can keep the corner or kill the P14 group?

It is vital for black to keep these stones alive as they are cutting K16 from P14.]

;B[ik];W[ic];B[kj];W[kb];B[kk]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: I felt this was a very bad trade for black?

reid: yes, the upper right corner is huge and white settles several weak groups.]
;W[qg]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: Now I'm abit unsure where to play, R6 or O3, or maybe even R12?

reid: THe corner is too big and white is now comfortably ahead.  Black does not have good prospects for increasing the territory he already has.

Blacks downfall in this game was losing the upper right corner, but there were many opportunities for both sides.  I think both sides should concentrate on settling groups before getting involved in new battles.

Good lcuk, play strong,
