[nd];B[of]C[P14 is a mistake by black.  He should play R11 or Q10 to make a base  for his stone before  running to the center.]

(;W[do]C[While w D5 is a good point, I think it is a mistake in the direction  of play here.  Since  b did not make a base for R14, I would pincer immediatly, probably at Q10.   Note that this  pincer would also be an extension from Q10.   See var. 1.]
;B[fp]
(;W[cp]C[w C4 is giving black too much.  there is only 1 joseki here.  It is  shown in the variation.]
;B[cq];W[cj]C[w C10 is too wide of an extension.  This invites an invasion by b,  either immediatly or later.  The invasion would be hard on w since b already  has a strong corner.]
;B[cf]C[b could have considered C12 here to attack the w group.  but C14 looks  OK too.]
;W[kc]C[w should definitly pincer around Q10 before playing this move.  Q10  looks bigger and is  also an attack.  L17 is just territory, and your Q16 group doesn't need  reinforcement yet.]
;B[gd]C[b E17 is the usual move here.  G16 leaves the corner open at the 3-3,  and it is undercut  by L17.]
;W[mq];B[jq];W[qm]C[The last 2 w moves do almost nothing for w.  the 3-3 is still open in  the corner.  b should invade right now, and N3 and R7 will end up looking like bad moves.   You are  trying to turn Q4 into territory, and that is no good.  Better to make big  extentions  from Q4 (like Q10 or K3).]

(;B[qj]C[b gets his vital extension!];W[rd];B[le];W[ke]C[why attach here?  this just helps B.]

;B[nf];W[mf]C[sure.  this cut looks like fun.  b should simply sacrifice the 2  stones though.  see var 1.]
