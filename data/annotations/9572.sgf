AB[pd][dp][pp]C[This is my first handi-capped game. I've been playing on and off for a few months.

A few things I noticed while playing were that throughout the game I found myself thinking "I definitly need to play there next, that's an important move." When I think that white ends up playing there next. It's a good thing because it means I'm starting to understand a little bit better the game. It'a a bad thing cause white is one step ahead of me. However, I am glad though. Also I believe I was doing pretty good at first, but I believe at a certain point I should have sacrificed a small area to maintain the larger territory I had. Carelessness and greed got in my way also mixed with the delay of waiting to long to make important moves. With this said, let the learning begin.


Yoaav: Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review your game! I've got a few tactical suggestions, but there are also larger, more general principles which could accomplish much good for you. Here goes!]
;W[dd]C[andrewgogo [-\]: hi];B[iq]TR[fc][cf]SQ[pj][jp]C[Leoberos [25k?\]: Hi
Leoberos [25k?\]: That was fast, usually automatch takes longer for me

*******
So Like I said, this is my first handicapped game. Starting was a little awkward because I've mostly played as black and usually make the first move. So here I decided to reinforce the bottom.


Yoaav: To my mind, black made the first *three* moves. But regardless, I think this J3 move could be improved upon. It's not a normal extension from a star-point corner stone (like your D4 stone). It doesn't particularly help secure the corner, but it's also sub-optimal at developing the side.

Let me suggest, first and foremost, the triangle moves. Approaching white's stone is a great first move---you increase your development while inhibiting his. Approach moves are generally what's called for after all the corners are played in.

Another excellent option would be the square points, giving you what's called "san ren sei" (three star points). The most important thing about those square points is that they're five spaces away from each of your corner stones. Five space extensions are really good in the opening. The reason that five space extensions are so good is that they're hard for your opponent to invade. If your opponent wants to invade your five space extension, he'll either have to play right next to one of your stones (which is big mistake, as that will let you get much stronger) or he'll have to stay in the middle three spaces. Proper play generally requires him to stay in the middle three spaces, which means that he'll be small and you can profit by pressuring his small group. While he struggles to get eyes, you get points! (More generally, the easiest way to set up a living group is to have a two space extension between two stones on the third line, but there isn't enough space to do that comfortably within a five space extension.)

In general, keep in mind that your star points do *not* give you territory on their own. (Similarly, his star point does not give him territory on its own.) It's easy to invade a star point. (Looking up the 3-3 invasion joseki is really useful, just to get a feel for things.) The idea of the star point is to gain outside influence. You can use that influence to attack, and that's how you'll get territory.]
;W[dj];B[cl]TR[fc]C[andrewgogo [-\]: It took me really long

Yoaav: Important general principle: Play in the open areas of the board. White's move on the left side makes the left side less important. There's less room there than there used to be. White's move didn't threaten anything severe as followup, so playing elsewhere (as big a move as you can find) is the way to go. The triangle spot would be great here.]
;W[bk]C[Yoaav: This is a mistake of his. He's too low. Generally, in the opening you should play on the third and fourth lines. Think big in the opening!]
;B[dk]C[Yoaav: One of the important Go proverbs: Don't attach to weak stones. By playing right next to his stone, you make your own stone weaker. He gets the next move, so the local fighting favors him.]
;W[ck];B[nc];W[jd]C[Leoberos [25k?\]: Anyways, lets have a good game
andrewgogo [-\]: sure];B[kc]TR[pj]SQ[jc]C[Yoaav: Once again, you're taking a small move. The right side of the board is most open, so that's the place to play. The triangle move would work beautifully. Also, by playing next to his stone (even diagonally) you're inviting him to take the square point. That will make your stone much weaker and his area much stronger.]
;W[jc]C[Yoaav: Good response for White.];B[kd];W[nq]TR[qn]C[Yoaav: Mistake. White should have approached from the wider side.]
;B[lp]TR[oq]C[Yoaav: This move doesn't put white under enough pressure. The corner is still open, so white can live easily by playing R3. You can't box white off from the whole area and convert everything into territory. Instead, force white to live small while you live large! In this case, because of the stone you have at J3 the triangle move (known as a "kick") is quite good. It reduces white's access to the corner, and helps you develop the side. The standard sequence has white respond with O4 (to make his stone stronger after you attacked it), then black plays Q6 (putting pressure on the white stones and developing the side), and then white plays L3 (making a base). The reason this is good for black is that L3 doesn't give white as big a base as he'd want. With stones at both O3 and O4, white would want to extend to K3 (a three space extension off of a two stone wall), but that would put his stone right next to yours. It'd be even better if your J3 stone were at K3 or K4. Then white would only be able to extend to M3. Those five space extensions are great!]
;W[op]C[Yoaav: Strange move.];B[oo]C[I decided here to just try to let white have that area and limit his territory here in the corner. I made a mistake a few moves later that caused that to backfire a put me in a bad spot.

Yoaav: The problem here is that your Q4 and P5 stones aren't tightly connected, and so are still pretty weak. (Note that they can be cut at Q5.) It'd be much better to play Q5 yourself. Then your stones would be strong and it'd look like you were going to get good territory in the corner and side while white struggled to live.]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[lq];B[np]LB[lo:B][no:A]C[This was that mistake. I forgot that would have put me in atari. Should have played at "A" but then I thought maybe "B" would have been better to prevent cutting.

Yoaav: Do you know about life-and-death problems? The webside www.goproblems.com has a huge number of them. Doing those sorts of problems really helps you analyze local situations, and will definitely keep mistakes like this from happening.]
;W[no];B[lo];W[po]C[Yoaav: And there's the cut.];B[nn]TR[cc]
SQ[qo]C[Yoaav: Things are looking bad locally. White is much stronger than black. Don't fight a losing battle on the outside. Either play elsewhere (there are plenty of other big moves on the board. Notably, you could totally take white's corner with the triangle move! You might also try to take the corner back by playing the square move, after which white would take, after which you could play Q3.]
;W[on];B[om]C[Yoaav: Weak shape. If you're going to try to reinforce your stones here (which you shouldn't) go for a stronger shape. O7 would leave you with far fewer worries than P7.]
;W[pm];B[mm]C[Yoaav: You sensed the weakness! That's good; but it'd have been better to not need the extra move for fixing.]
;W[pj];B[oj]C[Yoaav: Don't attach to weak stones.];W[ok];B[og]
;W[qh];B[qf];W[dg]TR[cc]C[Yoaav: This would be such a great time for you to play the triangle move. White would be left with just a few points in the corner.]
;B[ek];W[ej];B[fj]C[Yoaav: Again, dangerously weak shape. You have to worry about the cut at D8. Because of a shortage of liberties it's hard for you to deal with it. Much better to play at F9 instead and strengthen your D9 and E9 stones.]
;W[fi];B[gj]LB[il:A]C[This was one of those moments where I thought "I need to play here next" and then...

Yoaav: No need to play there. There's still important stuff to be done with the corners and sides. The corner is less of a big deal than you might think. It's surprisingly hard to make points there.]
;W[il]C[I couldn't help but laugh at this point. Still I went on

Yoaav: Now that white invested a move in the center, you might well consider harassing him. You have so many stones surrounding that white stone! You might be able to kill it, and should certainly be able to profit by attacking.]
;B[jj]C[Yoaav: Good! Surround the weak stone. Cut it off from help and kill it!]
;W[jk];B[ji]C[Yoaav: Why play away from white? L10 would also have strengthened your stone, but it would have put way more pressure on the two white stones. If you stay strong and keep him penned in, he's toast.]
;W[ll];B[nk];W[ol]C[I was thinking at this point "white still isn't really a big threat in the center there yet, but does need to be taken care of eventually" Also, I felt engaging white right now in the center I would mess it up or maybe even push white to create a small little group that would be a bigger problem later then if I left it alone.

The next few moves I was just trying to outline my territory in the center.]
;B[jf]LB[hf:B][hg:A]C[Was another one of thse moments where I thought to myself  "I need to play at 'A' or 'B' next." Maybe I should have? I was afraid of losing some ground at L17. I thought maybe the two white stones there were a threat. However, now as I write this I think to myself  "Maybe J13 would be another good choice?" Hmm... Is it?

Yoaav: Oh no! The white stones on the right are threatening to break through into the center. This is not a time to play a move outlining territory on the top bit of the center. If white takes by playing at O7 that will also put your O6 stone into atari. You need to keep white from breaking through!]
;W[hg]C[*Sigh* I must keep pushing forward!! >:)

Yoaav: Mistake. The fighting in the lower right is urgent. This move isn't really doing anything for white.]
;B[ig];W[hf];B[gi];W[fh];B[ie];W[he];B[id];W[ic];B[hc]C[Yoaav: Why not G16? Then the stone wouldn't get cut off and you could keep reducing white's area. But, again, the place to be looking at right now is still the lower right.]
;W[hd];B[ib];W[hb];B[nl]C[Ok, so at this point I recognized that black group at the bottom right was essential for me to maintin good territory, but as you can see from my last few moves I was also getting a little greedy and trying work the upper left corner.

Yoaav: Good!];W[nm];B[ha]C[Yoaav: Playing ko? Bold!];W[gc];B[om]
;W[dl]C[Yoaav: It's that cut from earlier!];B[fk]LB[nm:A]C[I thought the move I played at was more important than "A". Hmm, I should have thought that through more]
;W[nm];B[dm]C[I thought that would save me. *roar*

Yoaav: You've now played two moves in a row in this left area. That means that white gets more moves elsewhere, and right now elsewhere matters.]
;W[mn]C[I guess my "roar" was more of a "meow"];B[gb]C[Yoaav: Why do this now?]
;W[hc];B[mk]C[Yoaav: This move is a bad mistake. Shape-wise, O8, O9, and N9 make an empty triangle, and N7, O8, and N9 make a pre-peeped tiger's mouth (that is, those three don't stop him from moving to N8 because he already has a stone at M8. More importantly, if white goes to M7 he'll have broken in. He can then either take your N7 stone or connect at M6, and you can't stop him from both. Much better would be to play at M6, then you could connect your N7 stone with either N8 or M7, thus giving you a chance to keep white's group on the right sealed off from the center.]
;W[lm]C[Yoaav: Uh oh.];B[kk]C[You know, I think should have played M10

Yoaav: Once white played M7 his groups were connected. The lower center area is now very small–––no points for anyone. Now is the time to look to the corners for more points. If he wastes moves in the center, that's good for you.]
;W[ml];B[kl];W[km];B[lk];W[jl];B[kj]LB[hn:A]C[Another time where I thought, I need to play "A" or somewhere in that vincinity. I'm starting to think I should really ask myslef "are the moves I'm making really that important?" "Is there a more urgent move that needs to be played?"  Cause now that I think about it, if white did play at point L10 I could easily answer white with M10.

Yoaav: Why play this move? What were you afraid of? If he played there, you could easily capture his stone. (Most simply, with a net by playing at N11. There's a weakness due to your P10 stone, but playing at P11 would be a much better way to deal with that. This move makes two empy triangles, very bad shape. But, again, right now it looks like the crucial areas are the corners.]
;W[hn]C[Yoaav: Mistake. Timid move where there are no points. You should respond by shoring up your weaknesses on the bottom.]
;B[ho]C[Yoaav: Attaching to a weak stone remains a bad idea. But, more importantly, this doesn't protect your corner. He could still play at C3 and live.]
;W[gn];B[fm];W[im]C[Yoaav: Mistake. Pointless move.];B[fo]C[Yoaav: White will have a pretty easy time pushing through. Better to play more solidly.]
;W[go];B[hp];W[gp];B[jp];W[kp];B[kq];W[ko];B[gq];W[fp];B[eo]
;W[fq];B[gr];W[fr];B[io];W[in];B[jq];W[an]C[Yoaav: This is called a "monkey jump". If you look it up online you can read all about it. There are ways to keep it from running through as much of your side as it did, but that's a bit much to go into now.]
;B[bl];W[al];B[bn];W[bm];B[cm];W[am];B[bo]C[Yoaav: Why this move? If you had gone to A5 his group would have been in atari. After he filled at A9 you could have played B5 to connect everything together. Now he can push further.]
;W[ao];B[bp];W[ap];B[bq];W[aq];B[br];W[ar];B[bs]TR[cj]C[I was trying to build a wal to secure territory, and if white played A1 (which highly doubted), it would have been a bonus.

Yoaav: I'm afraid that this move doesn't really accomplish anything. First, you don't have territory to secure in the bottom left anymore---the white group sticking in (terminating at F2, at least for the time being) means that there are no points to be had there. More importantly, this move doesn't force a response. White can play elsewhere with no consequences. There are still very big moves on the board, notably in the top left and bottom right corners.

A much more interesting move would have been C10. If he pushed you to the left you could capture his whole group, and if he pushed you up you'd threaten to capture his two stones by playing at at E11. But if he reinfoced that group you could go after the stones on the left again!]
;W[ak]C[Yoaav:];B[er];W[eq];B[dr];W[fb]C[Leoberos [25k?\]: How long have you've been playing? You don't have a rank yet.]
;B[jb]C[andrewgogo [-\]: about 2 years
Leoberos [25k?\]: I can tell. I've been playing on and off for a few months
Leoberos [25k?\]: Every time I think I need to play there next you end up playing there ^^]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[gh];B[ii];W[jo];B[hr]C[Leoberos [25k?\]: Recently told myself I need to play more and well, here I am]
;W[oi]C[Yoaav: Here's that weakness, letting white push in to the upper center.]
;B[nj];W[nh];B[mg];W[pg];B[of];W[sf];B[se];W[sg];B[rd];W[oh]
;B[mh];W[kr];B[jr];W[ks];B[js];W[mr];B[gs];W[fa];B[ia];W[ga]
;B[cn]C[Yoaav: Your four stones at the top only have two liberties. They can be taken by a white play at L18.]
;W[kb];B[kf];W[je];B[if]C[Yoaav: This is a mistake. You rescue two stones (worth 4 points) and let white into your area (worth more than 4 points).]

;W[ik];B[fn];W[ep];B[es];W[as];B[kn]C[Yoaav: So close to an awesome move! He can defend against this by taking at M6. To get something for sure, you'd have needed to play just one space over, the double-atari at K6. Then he'd have to pick one of the two groups to save. Assuming he had his wits about him, he'd go for the big one, thus letting you capture his three stones and rescue your three stones.]

********
Well, that's the end. I thank you for your review of my game and your helpful comments.

Yoaav: I hope my review has been helpful. Have you heard of Nick Sibicky's youtube videos about Go? He teaches a double-digit kyu class at the Seattle Go center and uploads the videos of them. There are tons of them, they're fun to watch, and they're tremendously helpful. A couple weeks of casual viewing would probably advance you several stones.]
