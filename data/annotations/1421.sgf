C[This is a game I lost.  I would like to know how to play better.  Thanks!  (Below I've add question at some moves.)]
;B[pd]C[bene: you asked how you could improve. this is a surely difficult question. i think that you should  ckeck strength and weakness of yourself and the opponent continually. when you are weak, keep yourself. when you are strong, attack the opponent. Easy to hear, but to hard to practice? but try it. this is my general comment. you lost the principle at some moves.]
;W[dp]C[bene: and if i comment another, keep focused. that is, think what is important, and what is not important. you should focus on the critical points, ignoring the other points.]

;B[nl]C[bene: black is good at start.];W[rp];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq]

;W[rm];B[pl];W[qm];B[rk]C[small move];W[kn];B[ll];W[lp];B[lq]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[ko];B[jp];W[io]C[now you are leading at opening game]
;B[oe]C[this is unusaul. k16 or d10 is a natural point. or, r14 is better than this move. you shoul play wide in opening game]
;W[ph];B[nh]C[good];W[qe];B[qd];W[rd];B[qf]CR[rc]C[Q:  B should play at red mark.  W is hard to get alive.  Is this right?  s17 is a natural choice. white can live by ko. s17-s14-t16-t15... but this ko is profitable. however, the move you played isprofitable, either.]
;W[rf];B[qg];W[rg];B[qh];W[rc];B[dj]C[good];W[dg];B[cm];W[co]
C[till now, you are leading. but white will lead after your next move.]
;B[jo]C[this move is not profitable at all. why? because white is almost alive at both side. white feels no burden even if w are cut. you are only making your cutting stone weak.]

(;B[jc]CR[gd]C[this move surely earns many points. however, the natural choice is g6. your center stones are weak, and this stones can be a burden in the future.]

as explained, g6.];B[gn]C[right!];W[jr];B[kr];W[jq];B[kq];W[ho]
;B[gp]C[just connect at F7 or near. dont try a fantastic move if you can read every variations!  " keep yourself, before attack the opponet"]
;W[go];B[iq]C[dangerous move. what if W cuts at G7?];W[hq];B[ir]
;W[hr];B[js];W[gm]C[Q:  B's next hand.];B[gl]C[right. you should sacrifice one of them.]
;W[fn];B[hj]C[no too far. play narrower at g9. this move leaves a cutting point]
;W[fl];B[fk]C[dangerous. leaves a double atari];W[hl];B[il]
C[you should sacrifice this 3 stones. escaping is too dangerous now.]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[jj]C[white should play ko at j9. black has a chance]
;B[ki]C[and b lost chance. because you escaped center stones, you should complete the escape. atari at G10-w G8-J9. then you are connected and safe.]
;W[ik];B[gl];W[af];B[ad];W[hl];B[oo];W[on];B[gl];W[bc];B[bb]
;W[hl];B[sh]C[this cannot be a ko threat. one sad news is black  has little ko threats...]
;W[jm]C[the game end in reality here.];B[sb];W[se];B[ch];W[cg]
;B[bi]C[right . you should keep here.];W[jg];B[kg];W[kf];B[jf]
;W[kh];B[jh];W[lg];B[ig]C[i understand this move. but there are so little ko threat for blakc.]
;W[ji];B[kg];W[qi];B[pf];W[jg];B[ih];W[kj];B[li];W[hi]C[saving this group is very small. you should kill the white center group, by M12. you had another chance]

;B[ee];W[kb];B[kc];W[lb];B[lc];W[mc];B[nb]C[this is nothing. you should capture the white stones at D15. or at least response at N16. this move is just solidifying white.]
;W[mb];B[md];W[nd];B[me];W[nc];B[ob]C[again small. capture the stones, or at least O16]
