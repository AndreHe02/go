C[mukimu [9k\]: hi
Grindel [10k\]: hello, good luck.

Choi : Pls. note that my rank is just 4K so some of  my comment may be wrong or not good enough. Moreover, I will not comment on some carless mistakes which I think you could realize yourself from the consequence move.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[nc];W[qk];B[qn];W[qh];B[jd]C[choi :Black 9 at 10C, 10D, 17F , 3F, 4K and 3K are also good choice. Black 9 at 16K is too close to Black 1 and Black5. Since Black 1 and Black 5 are already in good connection and is safe at present. Therefore, it is better to place Black 9 in far location at this initial stage. I  prefer to put Black 9 at 10K which forms a big protential area in the bottom.]
;W[jp]C[Choi : White 10 is good. It has two functions : 1st, to prevent black to occpy at 4K or 3K,  which will form a good shape together with Black 3 and Black 7. 2nd, to buuld up a base in the bottom side.]
;B[cf]C[Choi : I prefer Black 11 at location 10D to prevent white to build up a  big area in left side.]
;W[ch];B[ef];W[fd];B[gf]C[Choi : Since Black 9 is at 16K which will obstruct white to build up further in this area. I will prefer to put Black 15 at 16B to stablize these stones first.]
;W[hc];B[ic];W[eh];B[cn]C[Choi : Black 19 is better to put in 9C or 10C to attack the two white stones no. 12 and 18, If white put the next stone at 7C, black could jump to 9E or 10E to continue to attack the two white stones.]
;W[cl]C[Choi : White 20 is good. It has two functions : 1st, stabilize W12 and W18, 2nd, to attack Black 19]
;B[en];W[fp];B[dl];W[dk];B[el];W[ek];B[fk];W[dm];B[em];W[dn]
;B[do];W[cm];B[eo];W[co];B[cp];W[bn];B[ep];W[dq];B[eq];W[cq]
;B[gp]C[Choi : In general, I think White get a lot of space from steps 19 to here (41), the strength build up by black is eliminated by the two white stones White 10 and White 22.]
;W[mp];B[iq];W[ip];B[gq];W[md]C[Choi : The three stones White 10, 42 and 44 are not safe yet. I will put White 46 in 3K instead of 16N. To have two unsafe group of stones is not prefered.]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[og];W[qg];B[qf];W[ok];B[on];W[po];B[np];W[op]
;B[no];W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[qm];W[qo];B[ro];W[rp];B[sn];W[qq]
;B[qr];W[oo];B[nn];W[oq];B[pr];W[or];B[mq];W[rr];B[sq];W[sp]
;B[rs];W[sr];B[lp];W[jn]C[Choi : White gain a lot from White 58 to present (White 80), but it is mainly Black has made several mistakes. But it is very difficult to comment step by step as it volves too much alternatives. However, White 80 is better to put in 7K instead of 6K because there are too mcuh Black stones around. White 10 and White 44 may need be abandoned .]
;B[nm];W[ol];B[lm]C[Choi : Black 83 could be put in 8K to prevent white to escape, expecially when there are so many Black stones in this area.]
;W[rl]C[Choi : These 5 Black stones will die easily. So the most urgent is to excape the three white stones White 10, 44 and 80.]
;B[lk];W[hn]C[Choi : White should excape as fast as possible instead of try to make eyes in this conjested area with so many black stones!]
;B[ho];W[io];B[go];W[jl];B[jk];W[kl];B[kk];W[ll];B[ml];W[mk]
;B[nk];W[mj];B[il];W[im];B[kn];W[ik];B[hl];W[ij];B[jm];W[km]
;B[jm];W[nj];B[ki];W[kh]C[Choi : It is impossible to attack the black stones in this area, and there is no space to be occupied by White. So the best  popsition is to escape White 46by putting White 110 at 17L or 13N. Or to stabilize the right corner by putting White 110 at 15C.]
;B[ji]C[Choi : Black side should ignore White 119 and try to put at 17C or 14N.]
;W[mh];B[ii];W[gj];B[mf];W[fj];B[ej];W[dj];B[fi];W[ei];B[gk]

;W[hf];B[hd];W[ge];B[gd];W[fe];B[gc];W[fc];B[gb];W[fb];B[eg]
;W[gh];B[hi]C[Choi : Black 163 is not necessary and is  no good. Black should leave the two black stones 119 and 123 here. May be useful in future.]
;W[gi];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[bh];W[bi];B[bg];W[cg];B[dg]
;W[de];B[dh]C[Choi :  Black 175  in 11C seems better, Kill the white stone 170 and make sure the several black stones live first. Lost the 5 Black stones 15, 125, 13, 161 and 173 is not a big deal.]
;W[ci];B[ce];W[df]C[Choi : White 178 should simplly put in 14A and kill all the black stones. White stones in the left hand corner should be able to make two eyes easily and therefore will not be killed so tha tthe black stones will die by just has only one eye.]
;B[af]C[Choi : Anyway, White could kill the black stones by White 16A, Black 15A, then White 12A. If Black at 12A after White 15A, then White 15A.]

;W[oh];B[oi];W[pj];B[pi];W[qi];B[oj];W[nl];B[pk];W[pl];B[ql]
;W[rm];B[lj];W[rn]C[Choi : White 202 is not urgent. This could be placed after black put in 9O. White in 16A is the best move at present as it could kill the 7 black stones here. (white 16A, Black 15A or 15B, White 12A - Black has only one eye. Or White 16A, Black 12A, White 15A - Black could not put in 15B and is therfore only has one eye.) 
Alternative, white could consider 13S, 2D, 19O, 1M.];B[nk]C[Choi : Black 203 to kill the 3 white stones is a happy move, but not the best. Save the 7 black stones in the left hand side is more important. Alternatve, 2E and 13S are also bigger points.]
;W[ib]C[Choi : White 204 is too small and un-worth to lose the "first hand". 1M, 2D, 13S are good alternatives.
1];B[hb];W[jb];B[lb];W[er]C[Choi : White 208 could be in 2D in order not to lose the "fleading hand"]
;B[fr];W[dr];B[rg]C[Choi : As an alternative, Black 211 could consider at 14S.]
;W[rh];B[ah];W[mr];B[nq];W[nr]C[Choi : Alternatively, White 216 could put in 2M]
;B[lr];W[ls];B[kr];W[ks];B[js];W[ms];B[jq];W[rf];B[re];W[sg]
;B[se];W[ai];B[ae]C[Choi : These black stones are lived already, so go ahead to 17A.]

;W[ga];B[sf];W[rg];B[fa];W[eb];B[ac];W[ab]C[Choi : White 250 is not good in such case.]
