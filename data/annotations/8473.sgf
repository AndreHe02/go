Stanley: Hi, my name is stanley, i hope to understand how i can use my stones more effectively and where is my major mistake? I have made a few big mistake at my end game, can you comment on how i can improve it?

Thank you so much, hope to learn from you !

===========================

Hi Stanley,

I'm a little rusty but I'll do my best to review.

I think the main mistake in this game was your response to white's first invasion on the right. After that fight white had a really thick group facing the centre, and that should have given you a much harder time when you tried to extend towards the left.

Instead white played close to the thick stones and neglected the corners on the left. After some big fights you managed to reduce white's territory enough to win, but white really should have secured their territory much earlier instead of trying to capture/save everything (e.g. W72).

At some points you were a bit too possessive over your territory and played unsafe or risky moves instead of playing it safe. You don't want to avoid risk altogether but you need to be aware of where your weaknesses are. If you have too many weak groups on the board your opponent can exploit them and gain strength/territory through attacking.

Sometimes it's better to sacrifice or conceed territory if it strengthens another area that is more important.

See the comments on the individual moves & variations for more detail.

You might also benefit from doing go problems, (goproblems.com is good) and focusing on cutting/connecting and the endgame.

Cheers,

(;B[pf]C[This seems a bit too defensive. The corner is strong already and you could get more influence by playing elsewhere.

Also, white doesn't actually need to respond to your move right now, and could even choose to abandon that stone completely later on as it's only one stone. So responding like this lets white keep sente. White could use this to create a shimari on the other side, or prevent you from making one in the bottom left.

See variations for areas I'd consider (although take these with a grain of salt, as I'm not so good at the opening)]
;W[op];B[qo];W[ce]
(;B[ip]C[This seems a bit too far from either of white's stones, and white can easily prevent you from making a good base.

I think you either need to threaten the left or pick a fight with the right. In either case, white cannot play as agressively as they have their own weaknesses to worry about. See alternatives.]
;W[fq]C[This is a good move for white. It attacks you while building up the corner. White also has the prospect of taking the centre left point to create a big moyo on the left.]
;B[lq]C[At this point it looks like each side has similar territories, with black on the right and white on the left.

White can still creep in on the bottom left and can block you on the bottom right, so that whole side is still in trouble.]
(;W[hq]C[This is a bit slow. Compare to the variations. All of these are big points for both sides.]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[jr];W[hj]C[this was a bit odd]
(;B[go]C[This doesnt do anything useful. Use this oppurtunity to take one of the big points. White is trying to build a massive moyo on the left but there is still room to invade and the top is wide open.]
;W[is];B[js];W[gr]
(;B[jq]C[L3 or 4 would be better shape. Or you can just tenuki. This group is safe enough for now.]
;W[gp]C[This move does nothing for white, since you can just respond at h5 and strengthen your position]
(;B[no]C[Trying to take the whole bottom right is too greedy, you have too many weaknesses. Strengthen your stones on the right instead.

If white runs then you can build up the right more easilly than trying to trap and kill white's group.]
;W[pj]
(;B[qh]C[Should I defend from R12 or should i be more agressive and try to attack from P12?

Neither approach is really more aggressive than the other, as either way white can escape pretty easilly (see variations).

Choosing r12 helps you protect as much of your top territory as possible and makes it harder for white to form a base.

p12 would make it harder for white to run out and may be worth persuing if you wanted to build up some thickness on the outside. This could work well if you then jumped out at the top (as it limits the influence of p15)

In this situation I think p12 is the better move. In the game white gained a lot of outside influence and you were mostly shut off from the left side. Considering the state of the left side of the board, I think you could really benefit from more influence in the centre.]
;W[ok];B[pm]C[This doesn't hinder white much.];W[pl];B[ql];W[qk]
;B[qm]C[The last 3 moves turned out much better for white than black. You could have just conceeded the middle right to white and played elsewhere and you would have been a lot better off.]
;W[om];B[on]C[This protects the bottom, but now there is not much room for expansion there. White could also prevent you from developing the top right by playing e.g. O13.]
;W[nm];B[rk];W[rj];B[ri]C[This is small. You need to do something about the top left.]

These things just come with practice. It's ok to make these kinds of mistakes from time to time if you are able to sacrifice stones for the greater good :)

In this case if you'd have connected at g18 you would have only lost one stone, so the defense wasn't that bad.]

C[Here again I thought i was protected but I was wrong.

There are two problems here -
1. j17 and l16 are a knights move apart, which means they can be cut
2. Once cut, the group on the left is short of liberties, so it is very difficult to defend.

This just needed another defending move after move 220.

Maybe spend some time studying which shapes can be easily cut, so you can recognise them in your games.]
