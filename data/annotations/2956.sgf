I'm black an I'm submitting this game for comment because it is so different from any game I've played before.  I live in China and have just started taking lessons from a Chinese 6 dan in a group setting of about 10 people so I believe I have the opotential to improve quickly.  My big question is what lessons should I learn from this game.

Normally my strengths are my opening and gaining outside influence.  I normally use this to make one or two large chunks of territory.  As I've started playing better people I've begun to realize the truth of the proverb that there is no territory i nthe center.  My weaknesses are local fighting--and losing big groups in the end--or permitting invasions and life when i should be able to kill the offending group.

In this game I create huge walls towards the center but don't do much with them.  I give up on territory in the center and focus on notlosing anything too big in the middle/end game.  I'm also happy because I invade and make life where I don't think i should be able to and kill a group that invades me in the endgame--where as I normally fail.  However, after all these good things I still know I could have played better.  So I'm looking for some lessons to take from this game because normally I take anything different that I did --take it to the extreme application in my next game and miserably fail--but I did a lot different i nthis game--and I'm not sure which of the different things were good or bad.

Thanks so much for your time.

Hi Dan,

My psuedonym is Tobamf. I am a 9k on KGS. A little pre-amble before we get started:

1. Good that you have a 6d teacher in China. NICE! It is my experience that there are 'jumps' in understanding in Go, and you will find a 2k's advice  advice much different than a 4d's, which is different than a 6d's etc. The important thing to note is that until at least 5d or so, players really don't have a clue what they are talking about. Pro players have even said that amateur players, especially at the kyu level, can do more harm than good when reviewing. With that in mind, take this review of mine to your 6d teacher and listen carefully to what he says is right/wrong with my advice. He is correct.

2. Based on point 1, I try and keep all my advice related to books I have read written by pros. In this way, I hope to limit my advice to good stuff, not harmful stuff.

3. Books that may help you (now that I looked through your game) are: Attack and Defense by Ishida (AD), and Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go by Kageyama (LFG).

4. I am going to use AD and LFG throughout the review when I am quoting advice from those books, just so you know where it comes from.

5. There are tons of points in the middle. You just have to learn to use influence is all. So do we all. :D]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[ic];W[qf];B[qe]CR[re]C[this move here will strengthen your opponent.  A 2k showed me an alternative for black, which is S15. It seems to work very nicely for me so far.]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[nf];B[qj]C[this is a sequence I've read in a book--however white shoudl have played here instead of extending out--according to my reading.

This is my classic problem--I might know what "good play" is in a few set patterns--but when others deviate I don't know how to punish them--my current strategy is to play my stone where they were "supposed" to play theirs.


Yes, this is a problem with Joseki's. To study Joseki, you need to have an idea of why each move was made (LFG). Following a joseki blindly will probably result in you losing more than winning. 

In this case, I believe the move for white at R10 is to make a base for the stones, giving them strength. R10 might be a little close for your move, perhaps R9 is a bit safer, but you have the right idea. Your move works to get rid of whites base so he will have a weak group later on to babysit. Cutting and connecting, whether locally (in a close fight) or globally (whole board) is a fundamental of Go (LFG) and you have to think about your stones in this fashion.]
;W[pl];B[oj];W[le];B[cj]CR[lc]C[M17 is a move to consider. Try and think of your stones not as surrounding territory, but as continuous chains of linked stones. (LFG) M17 in this case connects J17 to O16, giving you a very powerful group, helps to create territory on the side and keeps pressure on the white group which is eyeless.

M17 for white on the other hand, cuts black apart and gives white opportunities to strike black where he is weak while building a stronger group.

There is no doubt however, that C10 is a big point. But I think M17 is bigger for black for the reasons outlined above.]
;W[fq];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[pn];B[jq]CR[mj]C[see how white P3 induces o3 and then when white takes Q6 black has K3? black isn't in any trouble at all with this group. Any potential attack white might have made out of this is essentially gone (AD).

Notice that there are 2 weak groups on the board right now, and a running battle between the 2 groups is important because each side can attack and strengthen their weak group at the same time (AD). White could try something like N10 for example. Anyways, I am not going to harp on this 1000 times :)]
;W[lq]C[i "know" from reading books that this is an unreasonable invasion.  at least i think it is? is it?

however i don't know what to do about it.


This is a very good question. The important thing to keep in mind here is surrounding conditions (AD. LFG).  White has a whole bunch of help on line Q, which makes it tough for black. AD has an excellent example of this on page 14.

Let me see if I can add a variation where black tries to kill and white succeeds in smashing black. I can't read it all out from this position, so if I were to play, I would play safe and link up my stones at K3 and O4. 

Once black is linked btw, he still won't be in any particular trouble because he has a lot of follow up to move into the centre with influence to help him. 

Ok, see branch in move tree.];B[lp]
(;W[kq];B[kp];W[jr];B[jp];W[ir]C[So here, black plays wisely. Good job.]
;B[dn]C[Think about solidifying if you need to solidify somewhere. personally, I like something like O8. You see why now? It helps to lock white in the corner area and connect the 2 black groups, neither of which have eyes. On their own, both groups are fine, but together, they spell disaster.

Let me show you a cool AD technique to chase one weak group into another and deliver a devastating splitting attack!

See branch in move tree.]
(;W[fo];B[ep];W[eq];B[dp];W[dq];B[co];W[fp]C[this seems like a poor play?

No, I think it gives whites group access to the middle. Remember that split I showed you? Imagine it now!]
;B[cq];W[bp];B[bq];W[mq];B[mp];W[nr];B[op];W[pq];B[nm]C[would one stone higher have been better? I do have a big wall.

Yes, O8 is probably better, but you have the right idea, which is the important thing.]
;W[nk];B[rl]C[i want a base on the right...right?
or i should fight for the connection at p9?

Fighting for a connection at P9 is going to be difficult at this point. Seeing that your groups cannot be connected, and that you cannot run to the middle (which would wreck your group below in any case),  making a base is a suitable choice.]
;W[pk];B[rg]C[s12 is better to not force his s14?

Hmmm.... not sure. I think this is an okay move if you plan to abandon S13. See the variation.]
;W[rf]
(;B[qg]C[later this seems to be a big problem--having not played at S15 now or slightly hereafter

we shall see when we get there.];W[pj];B[pi];W[oi];B[ni]C[this, upon reflection, is leaving too many cutting points--one of my biggest problems. P12 is better?

but i really like having some outside influence--i don't want to give it up completely do I?

You already have given up your outside influence. look how many stones white has... Black outside influence is going to be difficult to say the least. Probably black R11 is good here, since black is rife with cutting points and weaknesses.]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[nj];B[rn]C[greedy? Q12 instead?

Right idea (expand the eye space (LFG)), but R11 is more important now.]
;W[qi];B[qh];W[ph];B[ri];W[qk];B[pi]C[S9 is better?

hard to say. this group is really weak. I'd probably chuck part of it myself and play S3 to try and get some of it to live.]
;W[rk];B[sk];W[sj];B[rj];W[sl];B[re]C[too late];W[sg]C[this almost cost me the game--big mistake in this whole area.]
;B[lc]C[F16 is bigger?

No, this move is good for reasons I outlined earlier.];W[ec]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[df];W[hd];B[id];W[hc];B[if];W[ch]CR[df][cj]C[again seems unreasonalbe but how to respond?

Ok, can you see the difference in this invasion and the previous one? Here white has little to no support, so black has the advantage. AD has a bunch of variations on how to invade this quasi-connected extra large knights jump. 

Your best bet is to attack the top white group to get some strength, then you can attack the lone white stone at C12.]

(;B[dh];W[di];B[eh];W[ci];B[cg]C[Well, white just cut you in 2, but he has 2 weak groups now. Maybe this can be advantageous for you.]
;W[gf];B[ei];W[dj];B[ej];W[dk];B[el];W[dl];B[ek];W[dm];B[em]
;W[bn];B[bo];W[cn];B[en];W[bl];B[dr]C[this was too small at this point--i need to do somethign in that H6, H7 region so I can actually get some use out of my big walls right?

It's hard for me to see a decent continuation for black in the middle... white has a lot of influence to the middle as well.]
;W[er];B[cs];W[hn];B[jm];W[hl];B[hh];W[jk]C[This whole scenario here is making me very unhappy.  I'm losing all the things that I thought were mine as I was choosing to give up territory on the sides--however on the positive I am able to keep everythign from dying--which is unusual for me!  I also don't let him make any territory.

White doesn't need any more points to win. he just needs to prevent black from making any. You should be unhappy. Aside from attacking the E16 group, there isn't a lot for you to do. 

Keep in mind that M4 group is getting weak now.];B[lk];W[kl]

;B[lh];W[ig];B[hf];W[he];B[ie];W[gg];B[gh];W[hg];B[hj];W[hk]
;B[jh];W[ih];B[kh]C[this was important? it wasn't my instinct but my instructor was drilling me on not letting my opponent have that star shape...my instinct was more like L14

Perhaps your instructor means a ponuki? It doesn't matter here. Normally, a ponuki is desirable because it makes a strong shape that lives easily and so radiates power. So it is bad to let your opponent have 1, especially at the start of the game. Here, in close combat with so many enemy stones around, a ponuki isn't doing much of anything because any power it might create is neutralized.]
;W[ij];B[gj]C[this game is all about the bamboo joint!];W[jf]
C[L7 is Way bigger for him now right?  Its a weakness of mine I've had my eye on for a few  moves at this point.

Then play it :)];B[kd];W[kf];B[mf]C[still L7 for me right this is too small?

Hmm. not sure where your biggest move is right now.];W[ng];B[km]
;W[me];B[md];W[nn];B[mn];W[no]C[See branch in tree.]
(;B[on];W[oo];B[mo];W[om];B[nl]C[that worked how i wanted--i sacrifice a stone but didn't get cut at N7 like I normally would after a play like O6.

anything better?

Not especially better.];W[jn];B[im]C[mistake  L6 was much more important right--luckily i don't seem to have to pay too much for it. :)

if you can push into the enemy like this, then do it.];W[in]

Counting is complicated. Very complicated. Best to ask your 6d teacher about the gote list of moves.]

;B[bh]C[but then i start playing gote just shortly thereafter :)

how about the "dead" pair opf stones on the right side...
should i be trying to do somethign with these at this point?

i'm really not much of a fighter so i kind of wrote them off long ago--but later i decide to give it a try and make life--which made me wonder.

haha, why not? If they live then great. They shouldn't of course.]
;W[bi];B[bg];W[ge];B[qo]C[hows this--i wanted more like s4 but everythign i could read out involved getting cut in half as it was too low--i thought i'd try to scare him by playing a peep.]

no idea of where to go

Definitely a good idea to have a plan. AD can help with that. I think you need to focus on global cutting and connecting, what is weak, what is not, can I attack a group and make points in the process.... Good luck to you. I hope this review helped.]
