C[Hello, dear reviewer! In this game I played black. There was a lot of fighting and my weak technique leed me to defeat :( I think, there are many better moves, that I cant see. There are some questions during the game, but any other suggestions are appreciated!
Thank You very much for taking Your time to review my game!

RS:  Both sides played moves by groups already alive when you should have been playing to strengthen weak groups or take big remaining points.  Your center group you lost allowed white to dominate.  My comments are with and RS:]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[po]
(;B[ic];W[ed]LB[ec:B][ee:C][df:A]C[FR: In the game I played A. Was it proper way to use J17 stone? What do You think about B (E17) and C (E15)?
RS:  I think A is correct.]
(;B[df];W[cc];B[bc];W[cb]C[RS:  This is odd.];B[dd];W[ec]
(;B[ck]TR[ee]C[FR: What is bigger localy: this extension or taking E15 (tenuki seems doubtful to me, because white C10 make my wall useless) RS: difficult to say.]
;W[jp]
(;B[qk];W[qh];B[qf];W[oh]
(;B[pi]C[FR: Isn't it aji-keshi? Was simply jumping at P9 better? RS:  I don't know.  But you could try for a base with R7.]
;W[ph];B[nk];W[of];B[nc];W[oj];B[oi];W[ni];B[pj];W[nj];B[ok]
;W[pl];B[pk];W[pq];B[nh]C[FR: I wasn't sure about this cut, because my group is weak. Was there better moves (like jumping to M9)?  RS: This is becoming difficult.]
;W[li]LB[mi:B][lk:A]C[FR: In the game I played A (L9). Is variation, starting from B (N11) better? RS:  I would say A helps you and attacks white.]

(;B[lk];W[lj]
(;B[mg]C[FR: was O13 better? RS: I don't know.];W[pe]
(;B[qd]C[FR: Now i think, that R15 (variation) better for black?]
;W[qe];B[re];W[od];B[oc];W[nd]
(;B[mc];W[md];B[kg];W[kd]LB[lc:B][ie:A]C[FR: Wasn't it better to play B(M17) first?  RS:  Yes I think so.  B is good shape.]

(;B[ie];W[jf]LB[je:A][if:B]C[FR: Wrong direction? Was B (J14) better? RS: No, I think he must play here and save his N16 group.]

(;B[je];W[kf]LB[jg:A][kh:B]C[FR: Same question :)]
(;B[jg];W[if];B[ji];W[jj];B[ki];W[kj];B[hh];W[gf]LB[gd:A][he:B]
C[FR: Now A (G16) looks like a thank-you move  :( Is variation, starting from B (H15), better? Or what to do  now? Is it still possible to attack white, or it's time to survive myself?]

(;B[gd]C[FR: I have made some variations for the next few moves, trying to find better moves for black. I will be happy, if You comment them, or show the right way.]
;W[fe]LB[ke:B][hf:A]
(;B[hf];W[hg];B[he];W[ig]LB[gg:A][ih:B]
(;B[gg]C[RS: too agressive .  You have the weak groukp at J15 and K13.]
;W[ih]LB[ff:A][ii:B]
(;B[ff];W[ge];B[fh];W[ii]
(;B[lf]TR[ee]C[FR: Only strenghtens white :( E15 seems much better. Can black kill upper-left (variations, starting from E15), or there was way white can live (i cant see)?]
;W[ke];B[kb];W[ef]LB[eg:B][fg:A]C[FR: Was starting ko from B better, than sacrificing G13 in exchange fot left side?]

(;B[fg];W[eg];B[dg];W[eh];B[dh]
(;W[fi];B[ei];W[gh];B[cn];W[fq];B[ri]C[FR: Not the best spirit to play :(
 Can you show some more active ways to save  Q9 stones and attack/reduce white?  RS: I think this is good because you connect and make this group alive.  Your only other choice is to run to the center.]
;W[pf];B[rg];W[rh];B[sh];W[qi];B[rj];W[ej]C[RS: Tiny.];B[cq]
C[Good, you ignored his tiny move.]
(;W[dq];B[cp];W[dn]

;W[do];B[cm];W[em]
(;B[el]C[FR: Not the great reduction, but strenghten white alot :(
Now I think, that it was better to invade the bottom?Would You show some ways to do it?]
;W[fm];B[mp]
(;W[mk]C[This white group is already solid.  He should not play moves near it.]

(;B[ml];W[mj];B[nm];W[ll];B[lm];W[kl]
(;B[rn]LB[km:B][rn:A]C[FR: Is it ok or extending to L7 more urgent?  RS: This is better than B.  B does not accomplish much.  His stones at L8 are alive, so playing near them has little value.]
