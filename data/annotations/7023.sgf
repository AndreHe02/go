C[Comments by Az];B[pp];W[dp];B[pc];W[cd];B[qi];W[fc];B[cj]
;W[ch];B[cn];W[cl];B[en];W[fq];B[dk]C[Az: So far this is a textbook opening. The tenuki that black makes is very bad however.]
;W[co]C[Here I heard that black should play elsewhere because otherwise white takes the corner in sente.

Az: White does not have the corner secured yet. See variation...]

(;B[jc];W[dl];B[el];W[ek];B[ej];W[fk];B[dm]LB[fl:A]C[Az: Probably better to extend at 'a']
;W[fl];B[em];W[ck];B[dj]C[Now I see that white has successfully seperated black so I don't like the result.   Was the tenuki on move 15 okay??

Az: No];W[bn];B[gn];W[eh];B[fj];W[hl];B[gj]
(;W[in]LB[hk:A][hh:B]C[Az: This is very weird, thin shape. W should play solidly around 'a', after which J6 and 'b' would be miai for him (which sucks for black)]
;B[im];W[hm];B[hn]
(;W[fm]C[fixes his shape again.];B[fn];W[il];B[jm];W[jl];B[km]
;W[io];B[ip]LB[gp:A]C[doesn't work here??

Az: Not like this it doesn't. If you start from 'a' you can think about using this move, but black is a bad situation either way.]
;W[ho];B[fp]C[Now I feel like these stones are very much threatened, but I feel if I can live here, I have a framework on the other side of the board and I might still be leading even if he gets many points in this corner.

Az: It's still a game, but it's definetly difficult for black]
;W[gp];B[ep];W[eq];B[cm];W[bm]LB[bj:A]C[Az: Force with 'a' next, it is less certain to answer it if you play it next. In general, "force before living".]
;B[do]
(;W[cp];B[go];W[hp];B[bj]C[a good forcing move now??

Az: Although W will still answer it, it would be better earlier]
;W[bk]C[Here i am looking at his weak group in the middle and my two weak groups on each side of the white group.]

(;B[gh]C[Trying to play against the strong group to build up an attack on the weak center group.

Az: The idea sounds good, but there is no possible reason W would answer this move against his stones. If you wanted to get stones here in sente you would have to play F12 (a bad exchange in this case since the top is still very open). J10 is the best and only move since it forces white to push from behind, helping the 3 stones.]
;W[ii]C[Az: B lost a chance to switch to being the attacker]
;B[fg]LB[hg:A]C[Az: Slow and vague. At least play at 'a' if you're going to make a very solid move. This doesn't really do anything.]
;W[ig]C[Az: A good move. W is building up thickness in the center while black is playing in dame.]
;B[ge];W[ie];B[gc]C[finally touch a strong stone directly.

Az: The group is saved, but the cost is ugly.];W[fd];B[gd];W[nq]
;B[jo]LB[np:A]C[I wanted to get some use out of my dead stone at j4.  But not much use came of this move.

Az: This actively hurts your position, don't play it. W has too many liberties to get good forcing here. 'a' might be a better choice since you need to link up your stones and focus on the remaining moyo.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[ko];B[lo];W[jp]LB[lp:A]C[Az: We come to one of the biggest mistakes of the game: B absolutely must play 'a' next. It is a vital point which changes the situation quite a bit. B is already behind, and allowing white to easily link up is disasterous.]
;B[kl];W[kk];B[ml]LB[lp:A]C[Az: 'a' is still bigger];W[lk];B[mm]
C[Az: I don't understand what black is thinking here at all anymore.]
;W[lp];B[mk]LB[nj:A]C[Az: Yet another slow move. At least play 'a' if you're going to terroritory on the side here.]
;W[li];B[mj];W[mi];B[ni];W[nh];B[oh];W[ng];B[og];W[of]C[I think this is an overplay and I cut.

Az: I don't think it's an overplay - IF - white is willing to sacrafice this stone. If white is assuming he'll save it then it's an overplay.]
;B[nf];W[oi];B[nj];W[ph];B[pg];W[pi];B[qh]C[I think he is in trouble, and I want to make a large gain here.

Az: Blacks shape is thin here, so it is difficult to fight all out.]
;W[qn]LB[oo:A]C[Az: B 'a' for sure. W will then invade the corner and black gets a decent profit on the right hand side. I think black over estimated his strength in the fighting here]
;B[qp];W[oo]C[Here my original plan goes out the window (killing the stones of Q11.  I am going to take the corner and O3 if he lets me.

Az: They say that each time you change your mind you loose 10 points, but it's got to be a lot more here. Black needs to keep the RHS to stay in the game, the corner is not enough. This is the end for black, end of comments.]

(;B[ij]C[Would think be better.  I thought it might be too close to his white stones.  They are thick, but also weak so maybe this is not too close??

Az: This is the best option, it forces white to push from behind which helps your weak three stones]
