C[What's that move for? Spreading your stones around is a good idea but the general principle is to get the corners first, then the sides and finally the center.

This move does not net you any territory at the moment and it is still too early for a center fight.]

Actually, you already have a living group. One eye at A16 and the one big eye you split into 2.

(;B[hj]C[Aggie80 [25k?\]: Just threw a few stones in to make him fill in some of his own space.  Should I bother?  Or are the captured stones balanced by the fill ins?  I figured one stone that required two white would be a good trade off, but suppose that is only valid if he actually captures.

Filling up his own spaces should only be done in the endgame. Now, you should dive in at the bottom left corner.]

[ps][qs][rs][ss]C[The main problem in this game is that both players concentrated more on local, small scale fights instead of looking at the big picture. Large tracts of territory were ignored in favour of trying to contain or kill the opponent.

This is a common problem with the lower kyus and I myself have made the same mistake when I was a lower kyu. My best advice to you would be to follow these 3 rules.

1) First, look for any significant groups that are in trouble and needs to be saved.

2) If there are no groups in trouble, look for the biggest empty space and see where a stone might give the biggest influence over that space.

3) Do not be afraid to sacrifice a few stones to gain a solid shape.

That all for my review. If there are any more questions, feel free to drop me an email.
