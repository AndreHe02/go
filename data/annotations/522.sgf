C[Review for the GTL by Erik Ekholm, Swedish 1 dan. Requested by Neil Mitchison (White). March 1997.]

;W[mp]C[EE: Compared with the joseki (see diagram), Black has given White around 7 points more in the corner, and has a weaker wall on the outside (there is no eye shape for example). The only compensation is that there is more aji around N2, but that is not good enough for Black.]

(;B[mo];W[kp]LB[lo:A]C[EE: I think White can play at a) to get a higher position. It would get the most out of Black's bad shape. ("Always hane on head of two stones.")]
;B[lo];W[po]MA[lo]LB[ko:A]C[NM: I know that this was very
agressive, but it seemed to me a good
chance, given that both the groups
I thus separated were fairly weak.  Or
would something like Q10 have been
better?

EE: Black is actually not so weak, because he got to play the marked stone and has the sente push at a). This is Black's side of the board, and a fight here could make Black's ni-ren-sei very useful, so there is a risk of this cut being an overplay.   I think your suggestion to play around Q10 is correct. That way you threaten the cut from a distance; if Black has to spend one move protecting the cutting point, White can be satisfied. This may feel lukewarm, but remember the proverb: "Fight where you are strong, not where you are weak.".

Anyway, the next few moves follow naturally.];B[oo];W[pn];B[qm]
;W[pm];B[ql];W[nm];B[ko];W[jp];B[ll];W[ok];B[pj];W[oj]C[EE: This is of course painful, but it paves the way for the next white move.]
;B[pi];W[lj]C[EE: I think this is a good move!];B[nl];W[pk]
C[EE: Good shape and sente!];B[qk];W[nh];B[ol];W[pl];B[in]C[EE: It is not so clear anymore that White has an advantage, which maybe proves that the cut was inappropriate.]
;W[cf];B[fd];W[kd]MA[fd][cf]LB[dj:A][ce:B][df:C][di:D][qd:E]
[qc:F]C[EE: It is unusual to tenuki from the joseki in the upper left. If White doesn't feel like taking gote at a), the marked exchange is probably better left unplayed. Black can get a local advantage with b-c-d for example.

L16 also isn't really connected to White's weak group in the center. Generally, one should avoid having more than one weak group on the board at the same time.   White can aim for e) or f), but the centre group appears to need some reinforcement first.]
;B[pf]LB[le:A][nf:B]C[EE: I think it would be more interesting for Black to play in the region of a-b to keep White separated.]
;W[dj]MA[kd][nh]C[EE: Big, but something to strengthen the bond between the marked stones might be more urgent.]
;B[jj];W[nc]
(;B[lg]C[EE: Black tries to split White up. Another idea is in the variation.]
;W[nf]LB[ki:A]C[EE: This was probably what Black was hoping for. This is difficult, but I think White should try to get out in the gap around a). This jump only gives Black perfect splitting attack.]
;B[nd]C[EE: A troublesome leaning attack.];W[od]C[EE: I don't understand this move.]

(;B[ne]C[EE: This makes a bad shape. I think the variation is better.]
;W[oe];B[of];W[mf];B[oc];W[md];B[pe]C[EE: White's group is safe, but Black secured 40 points on the right.]
;W[kk];B[jl];W[me];B[jk];W[dq]C[EE: Big!];B[hp]C[EE: Black is stretching himself (too?) far. A keima is inherently weak and here, White is strong. If White cuts directly the Black stone will probably end up captured (see var).]

(;W[gq]C[EE: A diagonal contact move from beneith is generally considered bad style.]
;B[hq]C[EE: Locally, you have helped Black to split you in two in the most efficient (for him) way and your G3 stone is left in a weak position. The possibility of the cut through the keima complicates the analysis here, but the general advice is: think twice before playing moves like G3.]
;W[jr];B[gp]LB[fq:A][eq:B][cq:C][ho:D]C[EE: This just helps White. Black could try to use his strength by starting with any of the points a-c. But maybe the threat of White d) makes it necessary.]
;W[fq]C[NM: It seemed to me now that I was  comfortably ahead, with maybe 20
points more on lower and left sides than
he had on the right; and the centre wouldn't give him very much.
Was I right in this reckoning?

EE: Distinguish between secure territory vs. potential territory.

EE: Secure territory:
W: LR 24 + LL (up to line 4) 16 + 9 (additional points if White gets H2) / 2 (gote) = 44.5
B: R 40 + Center 5 = 45

White's left side is invadable and Black has thickness facing left to support an invasion. Black might also secure points in upper left and if he uses his sente wisely, it is not *that* clear that White has a safe lead.

NM:  If so,
where did I subsequently go wrong?

 Niall 5k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[qs];B[kr];W[lr];B[cc];W[hc]
LB[ic:A]C[EE: This is very urgent, since White's group gets very alive thanks to it. A Black move at a), besides being big territorially, promises more sente moves against the big White group later.]
;B[bc];W[kq]LB[cl:A]MA[jj][jk][jl][in]C[NM: Judging by what happened afterwards, perhaps I should have played something like E14 rather than L3.

EE: Yes or maybe something tighter, like a).
With his centre thickness staring down at you, it is no point in making the moyo wider.]
;B[ch];W[dh];B[di];W[ci];B[dg]LB[ei:A]C[EE: Why not a)? All ladders favour Black.]
;W[eh]LB[ei:A]C[NM: I didn't fany connecting under at B12 and leaving him a pon-nuki and
a good chance to push into my side further down.

EE: I would take the stone at a), making a ponnuki, without hesitation.]
;B[cg];W[ec]C[NM: I thought this was a nice kikashi.];B[ed]
;W[bi];B[ei];W[fh]C[EE: Look at the trouble he has managed to create because you refused the ponnuki capture!]
;B[ej];W[dk];B[gi];W[gg];B[ef];W[bg]LB[dm:A]C[NM: At this point I suppose I should
have taken A14 not B13 ....

EE: Either move is yose, but there are still middle game moves left. White is open around a) and there is a weak group at G13.]

I thought F17 was bigger.

Other big moves are a) and b).]
(;B[hf];W[hg];B[hd];W[ic];B[if];W[jg];B[jf];W[kh]C[NM: I'd have liked to cut at L14, but I
wasn't sure I could handle it - and since
I thought I was still ahead :-) ....

EE: Black has a clear lead. Cutting would not  achive much positive. I haven't looked at the rest of the game.]
