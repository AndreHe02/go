;B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq]C[So far so good, I think.]
(;W[eq];B[bo];W[gq];B[cm]C[Difficult to judge this exchange. Me feeling is that black has nothing to be unhappy about. Is white happy? I'm not sure.]
;W[hq]C[I suppose that this move is necessary, but it does seem a little slow.]
;B[po]C[Good.];W[ce];B[em]C[Dna: is it ok at this stage?

It was, yes.

This is your first weak move. What does it do?

It does not surround territory or reduce white's. Your group was strong, so it does not defend, and since white played H3, white is strong, so this does not attack.

Something like invading the top would be better.];W[pb]C[Dan: maybe playing here would have been better?

Yes.];B[qc];W[ne];B[iq];W[hp]C[I think that white is wise to answer, so you get some benefit from E7.

However, your two stones K4 and J3 in the middle of the bottom are pressed right up against strong white stones. I think it would be wise to add a move, at least in the local situation. At the moment white can easily invade around N4 since that isolates your stones.]
;B[fc]C[However this invasion is also a big move.];W[ec]C[This is the right idea for white, but I think that E18 might be even better. "Don't attach against stones you are trying to attack." E18 works better with C15 on the board.]
;B[hc];W[ic];B[fe];W[fb];B[gc]C[This is a heavy move It does not help you make eyes. The question about whether white makes a few points at the top is not important. It will only be important in the endgame. This is the middle game. The important question is will the black group escape? It would be better to just jump out into the middle with a move like F13 or G21 which also threatens a good invasion around C13]
;W[dg]C[This is a good move, defending the edge whilst attacking white. (of course, it would be even better if black did not have the slide to B10, but that cannot be helped.]
;B[fg];W[ef]C[This peep is not good. It strengthen black more than it does white.]
;B[ff]C[I think that H13 would be better.];W[if]C[This is right. Now white is expanding the territory to the right whilst attacking. This would be even better without the last peep.]
;B[gb];W[eb];B[ib];W[jb];B[id];W[jc];B[ie];W[je];B[hf]C[The problem with his sequence is that makes white really strong everywhere, Any interesting move you may have had in this area has vanished, and the black group is still not 100% alive. It might have been better just to jump once more towards the centre.]
;W[qi]C[I still think that white has a better invasion at the bottom.]

(;B[ng]C[Dan: I guess this is not ok

Well, the white group above is strong, so playing towards it is not so interesting. (Although the peep at N16 might do something, but it won't really hurt the white group, just make is smaller.)

The situation is that white has just invaded your side. This means that white now has a weak group. This means that you can choose what happens. You can choose how to attack, and white is forced to defend the way you say. So now is a very good time to pause and think about your options. What do you want to achieve by attacking white?

It this position it looks like you want to expand your moyo at the bottom. You also want to be aware that if your group in the top right corner gets isolated you will need to live, but you can do that by playing the good endgame move at R18, so you don't really mind having to defend like that. So something like the variation you give is good. You could also start with R9.

The other thing you can do is to count the territory to see if playing like that is good enough to win. If we think about the position at the end of your variation. It looks like the two black groups in the top right and bottom left corners are about the same size as the white group at the top, and the black group at the top is about the same as the white group at the bottom. So the game comes down to "is the white area at the top left + komi bigger is smaller that the black moyo in the bottom right? Well, the black area is certainly bigger, but it is more open. White will try to invade, but that is OK, since you can probably still win without having to kill white, just make territory whilst attacking. It would be close, but perfectly possible.]

(;W[rk]C[This is the right sort of idea. If white would like to makes eyes in what used to be your territory.

However, white has a better move. See the variation.];B[ql]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[qg];B[qb];W[ob]C[This seems a bit small to me. I still want to invade the bottom as white.]
;B[rf];W[qf];B[qe];W[rg];B[re];W[oi];B[lg]C[Dan: ? move

Yes, as I said before, the top white group is strong, so playing near it is not interesting. White is virtually alive on the side too, since R9 is sente, so keeping white separated is not very important. The important thing is to expand your moyo at the bottom. Something like O9 seems better direction.]
;W[jg]C[This seems small.

A question: how would you answer if white cuts at R7 or clamps at S6?]
;B[jn]C[Good.];W[hg]C[Ahh! I see, the black group here is still not alive!]
;B[gf];W[ia];B[ha];W[hb];B[kf];W[jf];B[ib];W[hd];B[he]C[This is a mistake. If white plays correctly your group can get at most 1 eye round here. So you are going to have to run away. Before you run away, you can make one eye, either by saving your two stones in the middle, or by capturing J19. Capturing J19 is clearly a bigger endgame move since it lets you destroy the white territory at the top next.. Even if white captures your two stones it is gote.]
;W[hb]C[This is a mistake. White should also play G16 as part of the ko threat before re-taking the ko. You have to defend, or lose half, if not all, your group, then white can take the ko and you have no way to make two eyes and have to run away.]
;B[gd]C[Dan: Is it reasonable?

Yes, now all your groups are strong. The question is, can you make enough territory from your moyo to win? Probably yes, but the game is still interesting.]
;W[ga]C[What?!?! This is very small.];B[bj]C[Dan: guess it was good. was there something better?

This is certainly very big. There must be other big moves, like defending the cut around P14, and streangthening your moyo, say with J2 or O9. Actually, I like O9. As well as defending the moyo, it might make white worry about his group on the side, and it helps if your three stones are cut off in the centre.]
;W[pr]C[Dan: tricky

Yes. White has to try something in your moyo, and probing the corner is a reasonable way to start.]

(;B[or]C[Dan: ok?

Probably, but this is going to lead to something complicated. I think that there is a better way. See the variation.]
;W[oq];B[op];W[nq];B[qr];W[nr];B[ps];W[kr]C[Dan: what is the best move?

Do you need to play the best move? or do you just need to play a move that is good enough to win? If you can force white to connect along the edge in gote whilst walling off the centre, then play O10 and make more than 20 points in the centre, then you win. Almost no risk.

Alternatively, it is quite likely that you could kill white if you cut the connection, but you would have to read very carefully to be sure. This would be very risky, since you could well lose if white lives where you should have made territory.]
;B[kq];W[lq];B[lp];W[mr]
(;B[np];W[ir];B[jr];W[js];B[jq]C[How many points is this move worth? Surely O10 is bigger.]
;W[nj];B[nl]C[Is this going to give you enough territory?];W[of]
;B[pg];W[og];B[ph];W[oh];B[pi];W[pj]C[Dan: ???

Yes, white R9 is probably a better move. Either white connects, or white can live by breaking in to your territory.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[oj];W[qk]
(;B[qh];W[pj]C[Dan: Should i play ko? Which menace is strong enough?

It seems a pity not to, since white is risking a lot, and black not so much, but you could have got a better ko last move. See the variation.]

(;B[rh];W[ok];B[pl];W[ki]C[White connected his stones in sente, and has now completely surrounded your stones. White can clamp at S6, so you should probably defend there next, then something like white C12 probably puts white a comfortable 10 points ahead.]
;B[lj]C[Dan: anything better?

Well, this is sente, so you don't need to worry.];W[li];B[mj]
;W[mi];B[ol]C[This defends against the clamp.];W[sm];B[rn]C[So this is mow correct.]
;W[kk];B[ll];W[kj]C[This seems small. C12 is bigger.];B[ci]
C[Dan: is it good?

It's OK, If you like you can try D11 which actually cuts white.]
;W[di];B[ch];W[dh];B[bf];W[be];B[dr]C[I think you are still just a little bit behind.]

;W[lm];B[ml];W[jm];B[kn];W[gk];B[gh]C[Dan: ? ok?

I is interesting to look back over that last sequence. At the start, if does not look likely that white will make this much territory around here. Somewhere you were tricked, or tricked yourself.]
