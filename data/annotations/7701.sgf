;B[cp]C[FieldBaron [9k\]: Have a great game

My opponent attacked at every occasion.  I later realized Black was attacking even when it was unreasonable, but I was so far behind by the middle game, and saw no way to invade, or reduce Black's larger areas.  I tried and succeeded in making territory in the center, by pressing on weak points of his groups, but some of those were unreasonable (on my part) and I think could have been ignored.  Perhaps my opponent was just playing it safe and defending strongly being so far ahead.

Please point out where my fighting could have been played better.

Tom:  You made a very big mistake on move 16, I can only assume you played it without thinking.  From there you were losing very badly, and had to make it up.  But then your opponent made two bad mistakes: the two contact plays against your 44 stones!  Unfortunately you were too soft on those attacks and did not seal in your opponent.  For those plays specifically, I recommend spending some time studying them, with the help of a stronger player if you know one.  I put some variatons I hope will help.  Next time you see them, you will be confident in your ability to respond.

In general I think your fighting could be improved by 2 things:
1) Focus on cutting off and sealing in, especially with weak groups.
2) Try to attack in a way that makes you profit: build walls facing your stones, chase weak groups into your opponents moyo and away from yours.

I hope this helps.];W[pd]C[Boghen [9k\]: thx, and you too];B[qp]

(;W[eq];B[dr]C[Tom: This is a very strange move.  When faced with an unusual move like this, take your time to try to understand it.  Often players will make trick plays hoping that they have read out the position and you haven't.  In particular: this move is very low, emphasizing territory, and you will probably get to trade that for influence.]

(;W[ds]C[This was super bad.

Tom: Yes, from here you lose those 5 stones.  What was your goal with this move?  First line plays are endgame plays.]
;B[eo];W[dp]C[Tom: A move like this only makes your opponent stronger.]
;B[do]
(;W[cq]C[What was I thinking?  This cannot work!

Tom: You need to tennuki now, play L3.];B[cr];W[kq]C[Tom: Black has a huge corner now, and white gets no compensation.  From here on winning the game will be very difficult.  White is easily 15 or 20 points behind.]
;B[fs]C[Tom: black doesn't need this move.];W[jc];B[dc]C[Tom: This is a bad move.  Black is giving White a chance to come back.  In general the 34 attachment is good when an approach would not work, similar to the 33 invasion.  black will either live small in the corner or escape with a small group to one side.  This move gives white a lot of choices, so take your time in coming up with a response.  In this case you want to work with the K17 stone you just played, so building a wall facing the top would be ideal.  If your thickness faces black's thickness on the bottom, it won't be very valuable.]
(;W[cc]C[Tom: I think blocking on the other side is bigger: you want to work with your K17 stone]
;B[cd]
(;W[ec]C[Tom: A general proverb: extend from a crosscut.  Atari often helps your opponent.  In this case I think the move is ok, but it's hard to say.]

(;W[df]C[This looks right to me, but I am uncertain.

Tom: this result is bad for you.  Your wall is facing the wrong way and black isn't sealed in.  I've made a few variations at previous nodes that I think look better.  The only plus side is that the black group lacks eyeshape.  Your whole plan should revolve around attacking the black stones.]

(;W[cj]C[This worked out badly.

Tom: I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish.  Dealing with black's weak group is very urgent, and you'll only gain a few points at best along this side.  It's important to have a definite plan.  To keep Black split from the other stones, a move like F11 is very big.]
;B[dj];W[bj];B[bi];W[bh];B[aj]C[This sequence only made black strong.]
;W[fj]C[I think F11 is a little better.];B[fk]
(;W[je]C[Tom: this is good, but I'd take G18 in sente first, destroying eyeshape]
;B[ic];W[id];B[hc]C[Tom: Now black has a base and will probably live.]
;W[qj];B[qd]C[Tom: The same bad move.  This time you probably want to get a wall facing K17.  Black would do much better to approach at R14 or R13, splitting off the white stone on the side.]

;B[og]
(;W[rd]LB[mf:C][ph:A][pi:B]C[Tom: Bad.  This only helps black.  Focus on protecting your cutting stones with a move around A or B, or attacking for more territory with a move like C.]

Tom: It's a little late now.  As long as the 2 marked stone were weak, white was at an advantage.  Now your best bet may be to take a point like R7 to stabilize.]

I've made quite a few variations on the fight below: it's hard to say what will happen, but I think white can at least gain points.  After this, white had no more chances to win.  End of comments.]
