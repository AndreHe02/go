C[My question:
1st, how to compute the compound of the black and white places?
2nd, how to know where is the biggest compound before the game comes to the end; and its following order (via places it can takes)
3rd, how to play when the game process to the middle?
Thanks any suggestions.
Sincerely];B[qd];W[dp];B[qp]C[Hum! I don´t like to place both stones alined like this, it becomes too shifted to the right!]
;W[dd];B[oc]C[Nice shimari!];W[jq];B[oq]C[Very good for black here! White cannot allow clack to make two shimaris like this!]

(;B[cn]LB[qj:A]C[NO! The best place is A (R10 or Q10)];W[dk]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[en];W[fp];B[gn];W[qj]C[Now white got to make the good move, it would be better for black of course!]

;W[pl]C[This move was slow for withe too, imagine if white get to play G16 for example!]

(;W[ld];B[ne]C[This response is too weak!];W[of];B[ek]C[If you want to reduce the left you had to invade not attach! The result of this attachment is the strenthening of the white´s left side, so next time try not to attach!]

C[This two moves didn´t help you make any territory, and it induced whit to make the M12 and N14, which help white a lot to make territory in the center, you have to make something about the center and the left side territory or you will lose this game.]

You cannot allow white to make territory like this, it was too easy!

You try to save every single stone on the board, try not to do this, stones that should be saved are:
 1. Stones that cut two weak enemy groups
 2. A stone that links a weak group to a strong group or two weak groups
 3. Stones that make frontiers between your territory and the enemy´s territory.

Try to correct this mistakes and you will have a better game indeed.
