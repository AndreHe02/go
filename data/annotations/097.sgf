(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[Black has alot
of good ideas in this game. He deserved to win, especially for his strong
middle game play in the lower right. The game slipped away through a little
thoughtless greed.

Black can improve his game by a stone by following up his own moves when
white ignores him. When white tenukis, follow your own move up unless white
has played an absolute sente
move.]EV[A game played on the Internet Go Server]US[Brought to you by IGS]

play?];W[ql]M[fc]C['b' (q18)  is better because it takes the corner and
puts pressure on w.

It also leaves w without a good move at the top.

'a' (m17)  is in the wrong direction because the top is small for both
sides because the triangled stone, (f17), is low.]

overplay?

earlier, since it's sente.
Maybe directly after the marked stone was played, since peeping at 'a' no
longer works.

'a' is a negative just take at 'b' (o15).]
