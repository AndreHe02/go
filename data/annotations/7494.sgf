C[B: This is an excellent game for a review. The main theme is attacking. Usually it is best to attack from the distance. The attack usually doesnt lead to the death of the attack group, but rather to influence or territory. 
I think you do not attack enough. Look for weak groups of your oponent and plan an attack!]

B: After your R15 this point realy became interesting. Good extension from your corner enclosure. So: Your move is good!]

(;W[md]C[B: This is an important mistake: Do not touch the weak stone!  You make it strong. Attack from the distance. Drive it toward your area of strength. If the upper right quarter of the board would be already your territory  this would be wrong (you would drive him imto your territory). But as this is an area of strength and influence it is correct to drive him in. Black will stay weak and you will get territory in the process.]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[nd];W[nc];B[me]C[B: Black got a very nice Ponuki. Black is leading in territory and in influence. Prospects look bleak for white.]

;B[re];W[rf];B[sd];W[qg];B[pf];W[qf];B[fl]C[This huge black moyo - when would have been the time to invade? And how?

B: This looks nearly like territory already.  Invading leads to a very weak group. As you have nearly no influence this doesnt look like a good idea. 
I would try to attack the black stones in the upper right. They still have no eyes. After attacking you might have enough influence to do something about the big black lower right corner.]

(;B[fo]C[B: these blacks moves are weak. your white stones should have no chance to live or to connect. This move is to close and the wrong direction. black doesnt need extra stones at the lower edge.]

;B[jo];W[lm]C[I was happy I finally pulled out my stones, but I feel black just profited too much from this.
B: This is an excellent result, given the weak invasion. You should be very happy. There are black stones to attack. Your invasion had to end with a very weak white group. This group must find a way to white allies. And at the beginning  one hardly could see which allies it could run for, at the end you fought your way to safety. Well done!]

;B[id];W[ib]C[B: Territorily a big move. But: You are far behind in territory. If you just make moves, which make a bit of territory here and a bit there, you should not be able to catch up. This move could easily finish all attacking options.
Try estimating the score during the game. This move might be good in a close game. But here you need to try to attack!

The strange thing is: At the end you were nearly successful with this move.  So it is probably not as bad as it looks to me. You nearly caught up in territory later.]

C[B: Good! maybe you want to attack this group now? Or is it meant as an endgame move? Its a good idea to attack here.]

[od][pd][qd][sd][me][oe][re][of][pf][oh]C[B: Continue your attack! Play at A. Black has to worry about B and might end up with only one eye, if he doesnt defend. A has also some attacking power against the triangled stones. Your circled stone is weak and can be cut at  C if need be.]
;B[fg];W[gi];B[fj];W[gh]
(;B[ek]C[B: Black gives back something of his lead here.
Note: This attack of yours (even if the attack was not totally correct) brought you back into the game. Black makes a purely defensive move, which is a big success for white. 
You should attack more in your future games!];W[le]C[B: If you want toattack: Attack from the distance! This move gives you one stone, but makes black stronger.]

B: Hard to tell. In this phase of the game I would not speak about bigness of moves. The leading question is: which are the good attacking moves? There are two attackable black groups. You could try to drive the one group toward the other and then: splitting attack.]
