;W[ed];B[dd]C[D16 doesn't look good.  i prefer F15 or even better G15.  D16 only makes white stronger.]
;W[ec];B[bf];W[bc];B[ci];W[cn];B[fq]C[I would play K16 or Q10.  C6 is already in place, so white D4 is too strong to attack directly i think]

attacking is better (i dont know for sure what's best, but i would play black P2 (attack) or O4 (influence) or Q6 (right side]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[perhaps taking the right side is better: you already have the right bottom corner, so making an extension later will extend from both corners.  with the played sequence white can play on the right side so black has 3 weak groups (bottom right corner, up
per right corner, m17 and whatever extension of it).   See variation]

(;B[lp]C[this exchange doesnt seem profitable.
see variation for alternative];W[lq];B[kp]C[this is not good i think.  White can simply give up L5 and L7 and play as in this game and connect his M3 and his R6 groups.  Black mustn't allow this.]
;W[mp];B[lo];W[mo];B[ln];W[kn]C[perhaps its better to just give up some stones (L5-L7) instead of creating a heavy group trying to save them.  Black is strong now, so white can't hope get out both groups (L5 and L3) in good shape.]

summary:
both blacks and whites opening was reasonable.  In the middle game both made mistakes by misreading or by playing in the wrong direction.  white played more solid and bigger moves and won.]
