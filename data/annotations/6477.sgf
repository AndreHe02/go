C[Personally I was not satisfied by my play this game, I felt that I should have been able to punish black's unreasonable plays better. I'd like to get some insight into the better moves. Thanks.

Forfun (hereafter ff): Thanks for providing an exciting game to review.  There were a lot of interesting points and I hope I am able to point out a few things to try to improve on as we go through them.

You mention punishing Black's unreasonable plays better.  However, in the game notes you do not mention which plays you thought were unreasonable.  At a couple of key points White made unreasonable cuts (as we will see).  This put White behind in the early going and left Black thick.  It is difficult to "punish" your opponent when you are equally weak.  A key to improving for all of us is being able to understand our own plays in a balanced way - not only the good aspects we would like them to have but also the negative aspects they bring with them as well.  Let's look at what I mean...]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[do];B[de];W[jc];B[lc];W[gc];B[hd]LB[kd:B]
[je:A]C[here i'm pretty sure black played H16 too early. I was thinking of G16 and leaving k17 alone but thought against it because of what I could lose... I ended up answering this poorly.

I was thinking that it might be better to give up some stones to get out into center and prevent black's thickness rather than attempt to live and give black so much influence towards the center. So maybe A or B may have been better than simply responding to black?

Although I feel B is rather slow it gives me a strong attack at O16/17 later, or that's what I was thinking.

ff - This is a new fuseki introduced by Lee Changho in 2005.  At the professional level, White virtually always answers at H17.  We will see what this is all about as we go along.  In general it can not possibly be good to give up G17 in order to escape into the center at this time.  If it were good then it must be better for White to jump to K15 right away, without playing G17.  Basically White is not unhappy to live along the top side.  It is then up to Black to prove that settling this weak White so early was a good idea...]
;W[hc];B[jd]
(;W[kc]C[ff - Normal is J16 as shown in the variation.  This is one alternative.  It is quite rare in professional play but that does not mean it is wrong.  See the variation for the more typical play here...]
;B[kd]
(;W[ld]C[ff - This is a very aggressive play since there are no supporting White stones anywhere in the area.  It looks like White is trying too hard here = an overplay.  White has to have some help on the outside to play like this.  Here Black holds both the right and the left corners.  There are no stones in the center.  White may have felt that fighting spirit required the cut but if we look at the result, White has created a weak stone without hurting Black.]

(;B[mc]C[ff - See the variation for the more common alternative here...]
;W[id];B[ie];W[ic];B[he];W[le]C[ff - White has no good follow up to this play, so it would be better not to play it now.  Depending on how things develop, White might want to play something else later.]
;B[kf]
(;W[fe]C[ff - White needs to seek eyes.  This play does not do so.  Better to just slide to E18...]
;B[ff];W[ee];B[ef];W[eb]C[ff - White turns back to the side.  The two White stones above leave some potential to play the hane at G14, but in return Black has greatly increased the outside influence along the left side.]

(;B[db]C[ff - See the variation...];W[ec]C[My very bad result for me in my opinion result... Very painful I think there is probably a better way to play this i Believe

ff - The point is that F15 and E15 contribute nothing to White' eye shape.  They strenthen Black.  Better not to have played them at all.  Fundamentally however, the problem was the cut at M16.  It is of no value to White on the outside and left White one play behind on the top side.  Go back to that point in the game and look at the result if White simply plays M18...]
;B[cf]
(;W[qf]C[ff - This play does not attempt to maintain a connection with the stones at M15.  This declares that they are a mistake.  But that means that they were better not played at all.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of]
(;W[qe]C[ff - It is an interesting question whether White can do better than this.  See the variations.  Fundamentally the play at R15 is played when White has at least the threat to push through at Q15 and cut.  That is not a realistic option here so perhaps something else would have been better.]
;B[qd]
(;W[og];B[ng];W[nf]C[ff - Is this a good aggressive play or an overplay like M16?  It depends on what White intends here...]
;B[od]C[ff - Black chooses to fix the defect in his shape...]

(;W[oi]LB[mg:2][nh:1][oi:3]C[Although here it may be safer to play R11, I felt that playing low would be too slow to play fight against black's thickness. Here was wondering if the atari would be better rather than the jump. (playing in the numbered sequence instead?)

Just simple yes/no here you do not need to get into too much detail unless there was a better way.

ff - White backs off from the cut at O14 and tries to play it safe.  This makes O14 into an overplay like M16.  It is not clear that it has to be that way.  See the variations...]

(;B[mg];W[dq]LB[ck:A][pl:C][jp:B]C[maybe a better move elsewhere? Perhaps one of the marked moves instead?

ff - This is the most natural play here.];B[jq]
(;W[hq]C[Felt this was wrong side.

ff - With the plays in the upper right, this is an opportunity to play similar to Black on the upper side.  The play from the opposite side, at M3, looks better.  See the variation...]
;B[nq];W[pn];B[pj]C[Was considering goint on top but thought it'd be too dangerous. would going on top have been better?

ff - This looks like an overplay but White has some weaknesses in the upper right as well so it is not all one way here.  Fundamentally White would like to push Black around in order to invade the bottom...]

(;W[pi]C[ff - Makes White safe in the upper right, but probably this is too passive.  See the variation...]
;B[pm]
(;W[qm]C[ff - This looks like the wrong direction.  White should want to build up the outside strength in order to invade the bottom 3-space extension.]
;B[pl];W[on];B[ql];W[rm];B[qj]
(;W[nk]C[ff - This looks like the wrong play.  First, it pushes from the top right, but the top right offers nothing for White.  Second, Black has the slide at S12 to damage White's eyes.  Therefore it is not a good idea to let the top right stones be cut off in sente.]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[nm];W[mj]C[ff - White has to go back and connect but this is too slow overall.]
;B[rh]
(;W[qh]C[ff - This leads to Black being stronger than White here.  See the variation...]
;B[rg];W[qg];B[mm];W[mo]C[ff - White is pushing from behind here.  This play does not really threaten the right side Black stones.]
;B[pr]C[ff - Black correctly judges that the lower side stones are more in need of strengthening.]
;W[lq]C[ff - In the game White uses this stone to make the lower right White stones safe.  However, this is a very sad result strategically.  White ends up far behind.  However, White does not seem able to attack the whole Black position and White's stones could end up under attack if he is cut during the fighting.]

;W[ni];B[cm];W[sg]C[ff- In the game, Black answered this play.  However, I do not see how White would kill if Black played away.  See the variations...]

(;B[qk];W[dk]C[Of course here I didn't black to make territory on left or else I would be behind by a lot. But is this the best? Perhaps there is a better point? Like E7, to make territory in the center?

ff - Currently Black has a significant lead.  White has to attack something and the lone Black stone is the only realistic target.  This pincer attack makes sense.  Probably it can not succeed in this situation, but it is the right try.]
;B[em];W[fk];B[bk]C[ff - Black plays it safe.  If Black jumped again to G7, it is not clear who is attacking and who is defending.]
;W[bj]C[ff - White can not let Black simply connect, but Black is too strong at the top for this to work.]
;B[ck];W[cj]
(;B[dl]C[ff - This was good enough for Black, but the cut at D10 looks better.  See the variation...]
;W[dj];B[bo];W[bp];B[co];W[cp];B[dn]C[ff - Black is absolutely alive.  Objectively White has a lost game.]
;W[eo];B[ap]C[ff - A strange thing begins to happen.  Until now Black has been aggressive all around the board.  Suddenly Black begins to play very conservatively and White starts to take the bigger points.]
;W[fm]C[ff - Good judgement.  The center is definitely bigger than the lower left edge.]

(;B[kh]C[ff - Another very slow, thick play.  See the variation...]
;W[jp]C[ff - Another big play.];B[iq];W[ip];B[hr];W[gr];B[ir]
