RE[W+6.5]

C[kevco: Hello, I am kevco playing black. Mostly I am concerned about the fuseki and early middle game. Thanks in advance for your help.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[ce];W[dh]C[kevco: I don't know what my goal should be here. So I just played along without really knowing what I wanted to accomplish. Very bad.

Making really good long-term-plans might be a task for a professional or a top ama. It's maybe the most difficult part of the whole game. Thus, we might have to stick to not very detailed plans.

Looking at this postion on the left, two things come to my mind: First, your stone in the lower left is high, thus you want to develop it. Second, you can isolate the last stone w placed on the board. These two facts can give an idea for plan: Isolating this stone, than attack it from below to build a framework in the lower left.

Of course, your opponent might spoil this plan. See the variation for a possible continuation and how to deal with a non-coopeartive oppnent.]

(;B[ee]C[Having said all the things in the variation, this move is not bad. I choosed the other one, because it serverd a bit better to split off the w stone.]
;W[gc];B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[dd];B[de];W[bb];B[ge];W[ic];B[qj]
TR[ce][de][ee][ge][dh]C[This is the first move I would call a mistake. Now that you have build all the power you have to use it and attack the w stone on the left. I agree that it is important to play first in the right side, whatever the best move there might be. But that means that you have to take care that w cannot take sente during the attack and play on the right. Maybe he does it anyway, but then will get ah huge compensation on the left, while attacking further.]
;W[cl]C[Now the attack is harder, and the option of your moyo there is more or less gone.]

[cg]C[kevco: Should I have gone one more space to N17?

I do not think that there is any good move there, so it is hard to say which is better. The problem is that the triangled w stone is low, thus w does not want to play there either. If he plays there, maybe at the point where you played now, you will answer with 'A' and get excellent shape on the right.

'B' seems to be an intersting point. The marked w group on the left is still a bit thin, so that it is not very easy for w to invade your lower left.

On the other hand: Your upper left group starts to get weak, too. Thus it might be a good idea to strengthen it. But it is hard to find a good point where to start with this. It is not easy to find attacking moves against the adjacent w groups which strengthens your triangled group. Thus, if you cannot attack the left-side group anyway, how about the variation?]
;W[hg];B[ie];W[lc]TR[hg]C[The marked w stone seems to be quite bad placed, but it is surprisingly difficult to find a good next move for b. The result in the game is bad for b (s. comments on move 38). I offer you one variation, which might be better, even though it is not really convincing either.]

(;B[fh];W[fg];B[eg];W[eh];B[gg];W[gh];B[ff];W[fi];B[fg];W[gi]
C[B is horribly overconcentrated an w has excellent shape. This result is definitly bad for b.]
;B[bf];W[bg];B[ag]C[This is late endgame! Be careful, w might not answer there. See var.]

(;W[ah];B[af];W[bi];B[hf];W[ig];B[eq]LB[jo:A]C[Now you got to play there, very good move. But 'A' might be slightly more ambitious. It is still harder for w to invade, and 'A' radiates power all over the board.]
;W[qh];B[qe]C[Another good move. W begins to fall behind in territory, with nothing really left to attack.]
;W[oh];B[oj]C[The last weak b group on the board. You definitly have to play here.]
;W[mh];B[hp]C[kevco: perhaps this is over concentrated and I should have extended to K5? Or perhaps played P6 or P7?

Yes, definitly K5. It also helps your group on the right.];W[on]
C[This only strengthens your group, thus it is bad. W should attack this group stonger.]
;B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[pn];B[nl];W[mm]LB[em:A][lk:B][lj:C]TR[mh]
[oh][qh]C[Now the endgame starts. All groups are settled. Only the borders will be shifted a bit. That is the latest place where one should count for the first time, to get an overview. This will determine the tactics for the endgame. So let's count:

Black:
LL   : 35
UL   :  5
UR   : 15
R    :  5
Prisn:  1
Sum  : 61

White:
L   : 15
U   : 20
LR  : 20
Komi:  6.5
Sum : 61.5

Thus, the game is roughly even, but you have sente. The question is: how many points can w make in the middle. The only potential where w can make additional territory. On the other hand, b might expand his lower left group a bit into the middle, too. Considering only this, a move around 'A' comes into mind. The borderlind of the two territories. Whoever gets to play there first, will have an advantage.

Another point are the triangled w stones. They have neither two eyes, nor are they really connected to a living group. Thus, a move like b might activate some potential there. Of course there is no real thrat that these stones will be captured. but some sente moves in that region might come very handy for b.

Now, where to play first? Around 'A', or at 'B'? Let's examine the latter. First question: is it sente? Well, probably not. The threat against the marked stones is not very big. Second question: Does w want to play in that region? Yes, e.g. 'C' seems to be very big for w.

Now to a move around 'A'. Is it sente? Yes, since it is at the borderlines of two territories it has huge follow-ups. (B might end in gote after a longer series of moves, but then he will have a hughe territorial improvement.) Does w want to play there? Yes, w 'A' is an excellent move, and also sente for the same reason. Thus, even so 'B' is a good move, a move around 'A' is more urgent. Let's examine how to play there in the next variations.]

(;B[ro]C[But this move is purely territorial endgame. Much too early for move #61.]
;W[rp];B[rn]C[And even gote!];W[lj]C[kevco: No

Yes, awful. And not the worst w could have done, as we saw earlier.]

LB[lc:A][ic:B]C[Very nice tesuji, but only useful if you can capture 'A' (or 'B', of course).]
;W[hb];B[kb];W[ia];B[kc]LB[mb:A]C[kevco: Maybe I should have  played M18 and given up K17?

In that case you shouldn't play this sequence at all, buit play normal endgame at 'A'.]
;W[lb];B[ka];W[le];B[jd]LB[ke:A]C[The shape move here is 'A']
;W[md];B[ni];W[nh];B[mi];W[li];B[ii]LB[mb:A][jc:B]C[kevco: I should have gone back to defend at O18 here?

Both are big. Defending there is gote now. If you had played a normal endgame sequence there, starting with 'A' (instead of 'B' some moves ago), you would have got it in sente.]

[ss]C[Summary:

If I had to recomment a book for you, it would be "Attack and Defense" by Akira Ishida and James Davies. They state in their book that an essential concept of go is the balance of power and the balance of territory. When I look back at the game, I find many moves where you seeked to shift the balance of territory to your advantage, but you completely forgot about the balance of power. These moves can be found from the fuseki until the early endgame. Some examples:

#17 (R10): Big in territoral value, but completely missing the balance of power. Ironically, have a look at the end position: How many points did you make with your stones around R10? How many points did w make with his left side group, where he played after R10. What does your strong wall at the upper left look like now?

#41 (A13): Endgame!

#47 (E3): Not bad, but a bit coward.

#61 (S5): Only territory again.

Of course, sometimes it is necessary to build territory, like with move #49.

Maybe you should go over some of your next games thoroughly, after they are finished, and every time when you make a move which is nothing but big in respect to territory, you should search the board for strong and weak groups, for power and weaknesses. Then ask yourself if you find a way to use it - making even more territory in the end.]
