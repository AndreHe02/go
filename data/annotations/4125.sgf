C[Hi reviewer. Thank you for having a look at this game.

******************
No problem. Thanks for letting me look it over.];B[cp];W[pp]
;B[qd];W[cc];B[qn];W[ql]C[This opening feels very wrong. Immediate continuation is even worse. Suggestions?

******************
A tight pincer like this is a rather aggressive beginning although it is playable.  Generally though, without supporting stones this leaves too many weaknesses for white (black is already a splitting stone).]
;B[on];W[np];B[qi]
(;W[qp]C[believe it or not, r8 was actually played with something like this in mind. This is typical of my play at the moment. Try to start a fight of some kind, leave it to close off a nearby group, then see if I can extract myself somehow. Feel free to swear in any comment here.

******************

R4 is not a typical continuation because even if black goes to s4, white goes to R3, black S3, white S2, and white still retains the corner. Diving in at 3-3 is not an option for black because the resulting outside strength would be devastating on the two black stones above.]
;B[ol];W[rn]C[I am lucky, black lets me get away with this nonsense this time. Please, how should black punish this mistake?

******************
This is not terrible for Black, though the follow up is. Keep in mind white is not really securing much territory here and Black is gaining inner influence.

Black should tenuki here, since white is connected or possibly play as in the variation.]

(;B[ro];W[pm];B[pn];W[om];B[nm]C[Black fights too hard here to save everything.]

(;B[sn];W[qo];B[no];W[oo];B[mn];W[rp];B[mp];W[nq]C[Black has left me in the game where I might have been destroyed, but seems the black position here is very strong. What would be a rough game-plan for each side at this stage of the game?
My 11k thoughts run something like: black will want to approach white 3-3, build a wall and then make a corner enclosure to win with massive moyo.(Which direction though?)  White will want to prevent this. My solution in the game was to play messy, and everywhere all at once to break black up, but I feel that's not the correct attitude on a board feeling black's influence everywhere. This is really the big question that made me submit this game for review. What is the attitude appropriate when your opponent begins to build huge influence? Invade and hope to fill the board with stones, or try and grab territory for contrast?

From this position in the game, are either of these feasible, and if so where would you get started?

If, in some cases, there's something to be said for both, what are the cues that you use to tell which is appropriate?

******************

While it seems to you that Black has erred in the corner, in reality he has come out ahead. The influence he has gained, while marred by the O8 stone, is of far greater than the 6 or 7 points of territory for white on the right side. Perhaps even more problematically, white is confined to the corner, and his stones have fulfilled their potential. Black's stones have yet to make their influence felt.

Black's influence game is further assisted by the other white stone at 3-3 which is hard to develop.

At this point White needs to counter Black's influence lest the moyo grow too large. White play at K16 or J16 is essential (4th line).]
;B[mq];W[eq]C[Hmmm. Any very obvious alternatives for this move jump out at you?

******************

While I understand the desire to break up black, this is suicide. No question, Black should have pincered the stone from his wall. Then he would build territory while attacking. Ideal.]

(;B[dn]C[This surprised me. Should it? What are black's other options here?

******************

See variation. Black has made a mistake.];W[hq]C[This is exactly what White should do.]
;B[jq]C[Now the wall's influence has been compromised. Black is overconcentrated.]
;W[cq]C[C2 is rock solid. Better.];B[bq]
(;W[dq]
(;B[dp];W[lo]C[Does black really have to respond to this? With hindsight, I think not. In that case, is it right to jump toward the centre from this group immediately, play b2, or leave it as it is?

******************

Black must respond. The split is too painful, especially with O8 stone.]

;W[pc];B[oe];W[nd]C[This sequence was poor on black's part. The stone should have been pincered. Black would have benefitted greatly in the attack. White's stones here are working very well. Black is cramped and innefficient.]
;B[dd];W[cd];B[de];W[bf]

******************
White has played correctly. Black should extend as in variation.]

;B[eh]C[Black plays correctly. The 4 points are meaningless.]
;W[eg];B[fg]C[White is giving black more center strength.];W[dg]
;B[ei]C[Black needs to shore up at F15. This is too aggressive.]
;W[dl]C[Comments? maybe n14 better? Or cut at f14, hoping to leave lots of forcing moves for k16 group to start moving in this direction?

**************************

See further moves in variation];B[fj]
(;W[fl];B[gn];W[dj]C[The game sequence is bad. Totally misread. Sorry.

The invasion dies completely with no redeeming features. Was this inevitable or were there escape routes?

******************

Generally speaking, one should do some reading to see if the invasion is going to work at all. You had some good moves like G6 or possibly B10 to help your stone, or at least gain elsewhere. Black's move at G6 was bad for white, and also helped cut off your escape. White should not permit such moves.]

I feel  I have the better of local encounters because I am taking territory along the edge, but my opponent steadily builds influence, and often central territory while I'm busy patting myself on the back. Eventually I try to break into the centre, fail, and the board ends up looking something like this. Heh, mostly with this kind of result too... failure.

Can you help me break this pattern?



Thanks again for your time.

******************

This was a close game as you can see. You should not feel bad that you did not win. Black was forced to conceed large territories to White in order to get his center territory.

I tried to suggest several ways that White might have broken into black territory, but the main thing is is to take center influence seriously. Its typically quite hard to build a large center territory like this because once the opponent can get in, he can wreak havoc. 

Once black got influence on the right side, you needed to play on the 4th line, perhaps on the star points to start countering the influence. If you see your opponent going for influence, do not let him get it entirely. Extend centerward from your groups rather than taking more territory. Had you done this on one or two occasions you would have won this game.

Once your opponent has comitted to influence, disrupting that influence should be a goal, but once disrupted, continue to take territory. Knowing when to switch is more an art than a science.

You made a few overplays. If you are going deep into opponent's territory, its important to have a survival plan. Your D8 invasion could have succeeded, but you were not clear on how to make that work. In such cases, it might be better to reduce. Sometimes also you can fake invasion, but actually move out with a different group, sacrificing the invading stone.

Good Luck with your game!
