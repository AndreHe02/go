C[This is an even-rank game with arthurdent. I am yyyikes, playing white.

I made a few comments on the file, where I think I may have gone wrong.

My general comment is that in games where I am evenly matched, I end up fighting to survive, and usually win only when I manage to make a big kill.  When I play weaker players, I run away with a lot of territory, but in even games I'm too busy trying to stay alive.

Any advice would be a great help!

Thank you.

;B[pc];W[dq];B[qe];W[dn]C[An odd corner enclosure, though I can't say that it's wrong. But it doesn't work out too well in this game.]
;B[cf];W[ce]LB[cj:a]C[White C15 is probably not the best way to respond to this Black approach. If Black plays well, he'll get to make a nice group on the left, and your corner still won't be secure.

Really White should only play C15 if he has a stone at about 'a', preventing a nice Black extension.]
;B[df];W[gd];B[cl]C[This is a bit far. Black seems to be daring White to invade. But it turns out quite well for Black.]
;W[cj];B[cn]C[Notice how this is only possible because of White's unusual corner enclosure. Black gets to strengthen his stones a bit.]
;W[co];B[dm];W[en];B[em]
(;W[cg]LB[ej:a][fn:b][go:c][do:d]C[White C13 is decidedly odd. The two black stones are stronger than the one white one that you have just attached to them, so this can't be expected to turn out too well.

I think just jumping out to 'a' would be a better idea. Alternatively, a play at 'b' or maybe 'c' - White's weakness at 'd' turns out to be quite serious - Black threatens to cut there a few moves from now.

See variation.];B[ch]LB[dg:a]C[This is also a bit odd - I think I'd play at 'a' as Black.]
;W[dg];B[bg];W[ef];B[dh];W[eg];B[be];W[bd];B[de];W[ee]C[Good choice. Don't let yourself be cut.]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[ae];B[bf];W[bb];B[ej];W[eh];B[dj];W[ed]
LB[kc:a][qk:b][nq:c]C[Perhaps a bit over-cautious. I think a Black cut at E16 would have been survivable. So I think you should take sente and make a move on the lower side.

This is important - you can't let Black get all the big points. There are big moves at 'a', 'b', and 'c' for you, and I think it's important that you get two of them at least.]
;B[ip];W[gq]LB[qn:a][nq:b]C[I think it's too late to expect a big lump of territory on the lower side, so I'd probably play at 'a' or 'b'.]
;B[fp]LB[do:a]C[I like Black F4 - in particular, it seems to aim at White's weakness at 'a'.]

(;W[gp]LB[fq:a]C[I think just play at F3.];B[fo];W[go];B[fn]
;W[fq];B[kp];W[fm]LB[do:a]C[This can't be right - Black can connect up with 'a' at any time.]
;B[gn];W[jj]LB[qj:a]C[I'd worry about territory on the sides first. A play at 'a', maybe.]

(;W[rn]LB[oq:a]C[If you want to continue the invasion, and you should, then correct is P3. See variation.]
;B[sq]
(;W[po]LB[oq:a]C[Unfortunately, you're just forcing Black to secure his territory. After Black's response, and possibility of continuing the invasion is lost. Black can expect a lot of territory. So 'a' must be worth a try instead, though I think with the Black stone at T3 it won't work in quite the same way. See variation.]
;B[qp];W[pj]LB[qi:a]C[You could extend one further from your wall. I'd play 'a'.]
;B[qh];W[ph]C[I think this attachment just helps Black secure more territory, since you must respond to his next moves...]
;B[pg];W[oh];B[qj];W[qk];B[rj];W[og];B[pf];W[mq]LB[pk:a]C[yyyikes: I am happy with the way the invasion at N3 turned out, but I fear that I missed my chance to invade the top right, and that's where I lost a lot of territory.


I think this move at N3 turns out better than it should. Also, I'm not sure you can safely play away from the right. The cutting point at 'a' seems to need to be dealt with.]
;B[mp];W[nq]
(;B[pq]LB[lq:a]C[A Black move at 'a' might actually have been lethal, though if it doesn't work then White robs black of all territory down here.]

;W[lq];B[lp];W[mr];B[nd]C[By the time he played 016, I think I had lost.]
;W[gk]C[An invasion at M16 or M17 is probably an idea at this point.]
;B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[gc];B[if]C[Odd. Black should defend at H18, I think. The centre doesn't look too promising for either side.]
