C[Hi, i am white in this game. I'm mainly interested in my early mistakes, that one i didn't noticed until now. During the game i was sure that i was leading, but i lost and what is evan worse, couldn't figure out why and where. So i think its something wrong with my positional judgment and/or overall strategy. Thanks for any hints in that direction.]

(;W[hc]C[Olaf: until this point i was satisfied by the position. The only think is, that nowL17 seems to be a bit low. Perhaps i was overoptimistic already.]

(;W[qb]TR[hc][gf]SQ[ke]C[this move is small and the eyespace in the corner is not at all important. What is important is that the marked B stone makes the W connection seem thin. I think it would be advisable to strengthen the center W stones before anything else.]

yes, but this thinness means W has to spend several gote moves to live while B makes points, or even worse he will be captured, so B has a superior position in my opinion.]

B played an almost flawless endgame. Now B's lead is unassailable.]
