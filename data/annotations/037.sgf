DT[1994-12-23]TM[600]KM[0.500000];B[pd]C[Polite :-)];W[dp]C[White don't want to play diagonal fuseki.]
;B[pp]C[Ni-ren-sei, often leads to moyo games];W[cd];B[ec]C[This move is correct. E16 is also possible and would probably have been my choice here, but that is mostly a matter of style.]
;W[de]C[Solid move. (Page 3 in the joseki dictonary :-)]
(;B[gd]C[Joseki. Other possibilities are: H17, J17, K17 and tenuki (playing elsewhere).

I whould have choosen J17, it works better together with the hoshi stone (4-4) at the upper right corner, and I know that joseki better :-)]
;W[cj]C[Joseki.]
(;B[pj]C[This move is wrong. The upper side is not finished yet and needs reinforcement. L17 is the move that is listed as joseki in the dictionary.]
;W[nc]
(;B[kc]C[M17 is better I think. Black is strong in the upper left and can afford a wide extension from that direction. M17 puts more presure on white.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[Blocking from the wrong direction. The extension on the right side is wider than the one on the upper side, so black should play so he gets a wall facing down the side.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]C[This is very good for white!]

(;B[jp]C[I think it is better to play the P13 - R13 exchange first.];W[pf]
C[It is very painful to let white come out like this.];B[nd]C[Necessary, but black becomes overconcentrated]
;W[qq]C[White is grabbing all 4 corners!];B[pq];W[qp];B[qo]
(;W[pr]C[Wrong order. White should play S5 first, so black won't have a choice. But here it doesn't matter since black will block at P2 anyway.]

(;B[or];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm]
(;W[gq]C[This is wrong. White must connect at R2 first. It is sente so he can come back here later anyway]

(;B[rm]C[Also wrong. Since white didn't play R2 black must do that. R2 threatens to kill the corner so it will be sente for black too. S7 should be saved for the endgame.]
;W[rr]C[Strange move. Connection at R2 is better.]
(;B[nq]C[Wrong. Atari at Q1 leads to the same result but in sente.];W[dc]
C[Very big, very good!];B[ed];W[db]C[Quote from the joseki dictionary:

'(profit) [White 38 and 40 here\] are extremely big. The difference between White playing these moves and Black playing at C18 is nearly 20 points. So both sides should try to play these moves, which are more than large endgame moves, at a fairly early stage.']

(;B[ff]C[Bad move. It accomplish nothing except losing sente. Here I whould invade or reduce the left side. Moves to consider are: E10, D7 and C7. I don't know which of them that are best, but they are all better than F14 in my oppinion.]
;W[nf];B[ke]C[Another bad move. Black has no moyo on the upper side to defend so this is just a wasted move. Since black is open at the edge (E18) white can reduce the potential territory a lot when he feels like it.]
;W[me]C[Small, and shouldn't require an answer.];B[md]C[But black don't want sente...]
;W[dg]C[Very big! Now it is too late for E10, but C7 and D7 should still work.]
;B[ej]C[This type of capping move is usually played when white is open at both sides of the C10 stone, because then he will have to choose which side to defend, and black can reduce on the other side. But here white already has a stone at D13 so black is only helping white to strengthen his territory.]
;W[kf]C[Bad move. The answer at D8 is nesessary. L14 doesn't require an answer from black.]
;B[le]C[Very bad! The left side is much more urgent, and if black is going to answer K15 would be better shape.]
;W[lf];B[nj]C[Left side still more important.];W[je];B[jd];W[dm]C[Finally (but I'd prefer D8)]
;B[jm]C[Counting the score:
White
-----
66 pts on the left and lower side
12 pts in the upper right corner
 8 pts in the lower right corner
= 82 pts total

Black
-----
50 pts in lower right moyo
20 pts on the upper side
= 70 pts total

So white is ahead, and can take it easy the rest of the game.];W[kj];B[lk]
;W[kk];B[kl]C[White is playing correct. Reducing and not taking chances.]
;W[jo];B[ko];W[kn]C[Overplay.];B[jn];W[io];B[lo];W[lj];B[mk];W[rj]C[Overplay?]
;B[qh];W[rh];B[of];W[og];B[oe];W[nh]C[Good move! Cut at Q13 doesn't work for black.]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[mi];W[qk];B[pk];W[ql];B[pl];W[jr]C[Overplay, and white should defend at K12.]
;B[ip];W[lr]C[What is white doing? Now black can make territory in the center.]
;B[ho]C[Good!];W[gk];B[in];W[mq];B[ir]C[Very good!];W[hr];B[is]C[

(;B[kr]C[Black can always take the ko first to see how white responds. If white plays a ko threat black answer and play L2 next, and the result is the same but white has wasted a ko threat.]

[Black is catching up...];W[fp];B[hq];W[fq];B[fo];W[eo];B[fn]C[Small and gote. R11 looks like a good point.
Now the score is:
White
-----
34 pts in the upper left
26 pts in the lower left
8 pts in the lower right
22 pts in the upper right
= 90 pts

Black
-----
60 pts in the lower right moyo (including captured stones)
20 pts on the upper side
= 80 pts   White is still ahead but there are a few unsettled areas.];W
[ga]C[Should be sente but I think R11 is more urgent. Also white could play F18 instead of the monkey jump, when it works, it usually reduces even more since it is on the 2nd line.]
;B[hb]C[Looks bad, but I can't find anything better.];W[gb];B[hc];W[ha]

(;B[ib]C[K18 better I think. J19 won't be sente then.];W[ia];B[jb];W[qi]
