C[Hello i'm Thomas your reviewer !

The first thing i noticed while watching this game is that black have poor shapes, and in fact it was a big problem for you during the whole fight in the lower side. Although it is right that your opponent played abusively, you can only profit of his mistakes only if you have a deep understanding of shapes. So my advice for you is to study some pro games.
Also, i noticed that you don't know know when to be aggressive or not. So, you should count and also ask you the question "what you should i do ?" and "where do i lik to play?". My advice may seem stupid but actually it is very helpfull.]

A or B are better options.]

;W[mq];B[oq];W[lp]LB[mm:B][mn:A]C[too heavy. A or B would be better]
;B[jo]C[good direction];W[ep]LB[lp:A]C[a very abusive move. white should settle his A group first]

(;B[dn]LB[jo:A][dq:B]C[I know this move is standard with the chinese opening bur since black has one more stone at A, you should be more aggressive by playing at B]

In this fight we see that your shapes are not good. If you want to have an easy fight, you should have a better understanding of shapes]
