A play at C would be slightly better.


A play directly on the 5th line is usually too high because your opponent can invade and live under.

To build a position, start with the 3rd line (territory) or the 4th line (influence).]

Yes, and even more L5 : it connects the triangle group and prevents White from puching in.

carthage31 [14k\]: thx

CONCLUSION  :

A-
I did not get the game's timing, but I think you could afford to take more time to think before you play. This way you could get a better evaluation of the positions on the board.

B-
When you build on the corners or sides, start with 3rd and 4th line, then you can extend higher. Starting on the 5th is far too high (your opponent can build a living position under your stones), starting on the 2nd is not efficient.

C-
When the center of the board starts to get crowded, think about looking at the sides and corners. Very often, simple plays along the sides or in the corners have greater value than stones in the center :

"The corner is gold, the side is silver, the center is a desert". Meaning that it's very difficult to build something in the desert, it takes a lot of effort and does not pay back so much.

Have good fun playing Go !
