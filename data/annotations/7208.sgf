C[Hello, this is a game played on KGS.  I played as black.

I have asked some question and tried to explain somewhat I was thinking under the game.
But I would like you to review more then my questions only.  I guess there is bad moves that I can not see.
The more you can point out of my game the better.

I would like you to only review Black.

Thanks for reviewing this game
- CaNilsen];B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc]C[I allways play black as this.]
;W[po];B[qm]C[I wanted to get sente so I could stop his keima in the lower left.

DC: try the hane r2, there are some nice variations.];W[qq]

(;B[qp];W[pp];B[qo];W[qn];B[rn]LB[pn:A][cp:B]C[Just remembered that A was not sente, so I did this. I don't think it was the best because of the white stone at B,
What joseki do you believe I sould use?  Is this okey?];W[oq]

C[It is said that in the beginning you sould go on the most interesting side's. This site is not very interesting, but I did not want him to create a moyo. Also is A better?

DC: Wait, Please try to find the most open area. If neccessary count the number of intersections between the stones. This is an excellent guide of where to play. The topside is more important in this respect. E3 will probably give whit massive territory while attacking, an ideal situation to be in.]

;W[cg]LB[ci:A]C[I wanted to maybe play A, but I have not studied anything like that.

DC: Play it then. you will learn, try to use your feeling and when you find out it is wrong adjust it later. Playing according to doctirines will limit your creativity and could make the game uninteresting.]

;W[ce];B[db]TR[cg][eg][di][dn][eo][fo][cp][dp]C[I believe this joseki localy is better for black, but the marked stones works so well together and later I lose the game since an invasion fail.

DC: looks good but don't foget the order of play, I think D18 is big gote, but bigger is Q8if white plays D18 you can play again.]

(;B[dk]C[I think if I could get this invasion to work I would won the game, is this the correct place to invade?
Also how sould I do it?

DC: invading looks incorrect here, you should try a reduction move. Plan goes something like this. 1. Look for where the weaknesses are i.e. D5 stone. 2. Find a nice point that could utilise that weakness to reduce. Invading could die here.]

Try using a useful tool I apply to the strategic planning of go. S.W.O.T.

Strenghts - Where am I\Opponent strong and how does it benefit me\Opponent?
Weaknesses - Where am I\Opponent weak and how does it benefit Opponent\Me? How can i fix this with initiative?
Opportunity - Where are the opportunities on the board for both?
