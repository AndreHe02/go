Hi, this game I played as black. White plays an overly aggressive style in this game. Its obvious that his strategy doesn't work very well, it's just that I dont play strong enough to be able to handle it. Obviously I have made a lot of mistakes which is why I have submitted this game for review.

[ZD\] Hi.  I will mark my comments like this.];W[dd];B[pp]C[Bogdan66 [4k\]: gg]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[qn];B[ql];W[hq];B[bp]LB[cn:A]C[[ZD\] This looks rather submissive.  White does not have a good attack against lower left corner, so either something more aggressive or tenuki would be better.]

(;B[dq]C[S.

So far I can see that white is trying to confuse black by constantly playing away.

This was a mistake because white can connect under at E2];W[fr]

(;B[dr]C[[ZD\] This is quite small, an endgame move. Comparing the two outcomes, you gained something like 5 points in gote.]

(;W[qo];B[po];W[qm];B[pm];W[rq];B[qp];W[rp]
(;B[rl]C[S.

This move wasnt as strong as I thought it was, I meant to play S7]
;W[rm];B[lq];W[pl];B[pk]LB[qj:A]C[[ZD\] This move helps white strengthen his stone.  It is better to just play A instead.]

;B[mn];W[nm]
(;B[ip]LB[po:A]C[[ZD\] This is the losing move.  Now white captures the A group and the game is over.]
;W[kn];B[lm];W[op];B[ok];W[ps];B[nd]C[S.

This move was not good. urgent moves before big ones, nevermind if M7 is in trouble or not. H4 is probably bigger anyway. In any case, O16 is bad timing.]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[km];B[mm];W[ns];B[lk];W[mk];B[kl];W[nl];B[ll]
;W[lj];B[nk];W[mj];B[il]LB[jl:A]C[Here A is the proper answer (even without the ladder, fthis just gives white more options).]
;W[jl];B[kk];W[jk]C[Ethelor [6k\]: Thanks for the game

S.

Didnt see the ladder

Anyway, this is a pretty short game. If I would have played better than maybe white's position would have fallen to pieces.]

(;B[op]C[S.

Black should really come back when he gets the chance]))
(;B[nn]LB[mo:B][lp:A]C[S.

Perhaps this is beter shape, no need to extend at N5 O6 makes the connection more secure

[ZD\] This invites white to play A, which might be a problem since your group is not completely safe.  White is clearly overplaying here, just capturing his group with B is correct.]

(;B[rm]C[S.

I think I meant to play here and decided on S8 for some strange reason...]
;W[rn];B[sn];W[ro];B[rl];W[qq]LB[qq:B][pr:A]C[[ZD\] White would probably play A rather than B.]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq]
(;W[sa]C[S.

I say white has to come back in order to live]
(;B[so]C[[ZD\] This move does not work.]

I was afraid of a position like this and the cut but I doubt that theres any real reason to fear. I'm sure a stronger player wouldnt mind this position as black.

[ZD\] There is nothing to be afraid of here, actually.]
(;W[fp];B[dq];W[gq];B[fo];W[gp];B[dr]C[[ZD\] This is clearly impossible for white.]

(;W[bq]C[[ZD\] So white has to connect.  Now you can kill the corner easily.]

[hq:B]C[[ZD\] White does not have enough liberties to do anything, and getting A makes B look bad, so this is not a good idea for white anyway.]
