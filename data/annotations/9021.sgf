AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Maere: All in all both of you made mistakes. I think you'll find many of these things will become easily avoidable as you play more games and learn from your most obvious mistakes.

If there is a lesson I would like you to take home, though, it's: don't be too greedy. Especially in a handicap game, white has to be aggressive and take risks to win, so your counter-strategy should be to play solidly. Calmly build your positions. When you have a safe base, you can then retaliate all the more. Don't try to kill everything that comes at you. It's quite enough to let your opponent live *small*.]
;W[qc]C[M: San-san invasions don't usually occur that early in the game. That's because this invasion isn't actually a very good position to work with in this configuration. The invader ends up with a small territory and not much of a prospective on other areas of the board, while the invaded strenghtens his position naturally by responding to the invasion. San-san invasions can become more advantageous later, when there are already some white stones around for example. Or in the late middle-game, when the corner is nearly-safe territory that's about to become yours, to snatch it under your nose. 

The point I'm trying to make is, this move isn't actually bad for you. You can let it happen and use the resulting position to your own advantage. You don't need to worry or try to kill that stone.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[rb]
(;B[sd]C[M: This atari is something that should have been played much later, if at all.]
;W[rc];B[pb];W[sc]C[M: Here's your last chance. Leave that stone to its death and fix your weakness at R15.]
;B[se]C[I felt that the shape was dead at s17, how could I have ensured that it was dead? Play at s1?

M: this position isn't dead and you cannot kill it (except if white makes a mistake). So you shouldn't try! White hasn't really all that much to win by getting that corner. You can give it to him. All you need to do is keep his territory small.

Before you kill a group you need to have it effectively surrounded. Your own position has to be safe enough. Of course, as you settle yourself, so does white. Only if you're safe faster than him do you actually stand a chance.]
;W[od]LB[ob:A][nc:C][qe:B]C[M: You're paying the price of playing at T16. instead of making a solid shape by playing R14 or R15.  Your were wide opened before this exchange occured. You have weak points at A, B and C. Fix one, white will use another.

At this point your best bet is not to try to save all your stones, but instead deciding what to sacrifice and securing the rest. You have three groups here: The R16 group (in danger of being split), and the two lonely stones at Q18 and P17. You have to decide what you want to save and give the rest to white in exchange for establishing properly at least one of your positions.]
;B[pe]C[M: I've wondered for a while whether there's a better move than this one but couldn't find one. You don't have many options that don't make you short on liberties.]
;W[ob]C[I feel like this exchange has left me wide open, what should I have done instead?]
(;B[nc];W[nb];B[pa];W[mc];B[nd];W[md];B[oe];W[ne];B[od];W[of]
C[M: And here it is, white's mistake. Up until now, white could squeeze you and there was nothing you could do because you were short of liberties. But now you have regrouped and P14 isn't an immediate threat as such. This move is too greedy. White should have secured his position instead (T19).]

;W[nq];B[lq];W[pq];B[qp]C[Was r3 a better move?

M: Not necessarily. When playing a handicap game, be aware that a complicated situation always benefits the stronger player. R3 leaves a cut at Q4 and the rest is likely to be a messy fight. Once your R3 stone is part of a group alive and well, white's in some trouble. But white being the stronger player has reasonable prospects of taking everything. 

R4 isn't bad at all. It strenghtens your position on the right side, building a solid group with your R7 stone.]
;W[qq]
(;B[rq]C[M: This, however, isn't so good, because it allows white to play S2, giving him either the initaitive, or an annoying dent on your territory on the right side. Just play S4. Or try some of the other variations.]
;W[rr];B[iq];W[rp]C[Obviously a mistake

M: With experience you will learn to be wary of the second line :-)]
;B[ro];W[sq];B[so];W[sp]
(;B[po]C[M: Here it's better to play at P4. The cut at R5 isn't any real threat because the ladder is in your favor.]
;W[op];B[mo];W[oo];B[on]C[Q6 would have been a better move. because then move 61 at the same point would not have been such a threat.

M: The more games you play, the more you will learn to recognize such situations. The one way to detect these problems is to count liberties whenever you start getting surrounded. Take your time and count. Only two left? You're one move away from atari! What can you do to escape if white plays an atari? Etc. However, this move wasn't the one that killed your stones.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[qn];B[rn];W[pm]
(;B[ql]C[M: It's here. Playng R8 instead of S7 is what kills your group. Always be wary of the second line! When your last few liberties are on the first and second lines, you're in great danger of being cut off for good.]
;W[rm]C[Maybe I should have cut my losses earlier because now I am going to lose twice as many stones as before]

;B[mn];W[nk];B[pj]C[Too passive? Maybe o10?

M: No. You can try something like P10. But O10 would just live your territory open. There is a saying: Don't go to war when your house is on fire. First get a solid base you can run back to, then attack.]
;W[ni]
(;B[lk]C[M: At this point you could have considered different moves that would have brought more benefit in other areas of the board. Some examples in the variations.]

;W[dl];B[dn];W[gf]C[He is interupting my play, were my moves too big?

M: If you mean: can he really cut off your stones, then the answer is yes. A two point jump between two stones isn't a safe connection. The cut can get complicated though, and in this case your opponent didn't do a very good job of it.]

M: Remember how I said that san-san invasions are advantageous in the latte middle-game? Well, this is it. There isn't really a good way for you to deal with this once it's happened. The best thing is to prevent the invasion altogether by playing in the corner yourself before white does, for example at D3. You need to time it well though. Too early, and you're losing a more valuable move elsewhere. Too late, and white will take it all.

Here you could have played it at move 118. But it's hard to decide in the heat of the moment.]

(;W[bp];B[bo];W[br];B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[es];B[fs];W[ds]C[This is a fail shape at d4. What should I do to deal with a 3-3 invasion that doesnt follow the joseki that starts at move 120 that I have memorized

M: D4 isn't a fail shape because there's a white stone at C3. You're handling it all quite well. I would probably have played F3 as my next move though, and kept the white group isolated in the corner in exchange for more territory on the bottom. You end up losing it entirely and I don't think it was  worth it.]

M: Ko fights are used when winning the ko gains you something, like gaining territory or, in most cases, giving life to a group. Have a good look here: winning or losing that ko doesn't really make much of a difference on the board. So white took something else that was worth more.]
