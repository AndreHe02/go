C[buckyyowza: comments by Mark Fyffe, IGS 7k. it is always a pleasure to answer questions about games, though i like to ask that you take my advice with a grain of salt ;-)  please contact me at mark@accessidaho.org if you have any further questions.  Also find me as "wonk" on IGS.

I am Thomas Quimby, IGS 20k*. Here I play B

Though my brain lapse at the end killed me, it seems that I would have won at that point had I not blundered so badly. However, that notwithstanding, I am not certain that I have any grasp whatsoever as to the actual quality of W/B's play or the soundness of my general strategic style. I'd also like to see how correct my self-assessment is, if possible.

For clarity, * signifies thoughts that came in retrospect after the game was through, while all others try to indicate my thinking during.

I hope that you enjoy the game.

buckyyowza: q5 is one of best moves on the board. A (f3) also comes to mind. white's hoshi play at b (k16) seems unusual to me, i'd like to say that it's a little underpowered for a high chinese opening.  when black has a strong influence position, i like to provoke by holding sente.  this is subjective since style plays a strong role at this stage of the game.]
;W[dj]LB[jp:A][fq:B]TR[po][pq]C[buckyyowza: white likes hoshi, but why not A (k4).  Imagine now a black approach at b (f3) to compliment the marked stones. d10 leaves the more important lower side open for black to develop easy thickness. (see var)]

;W[cq];B[fo];W[dn]LB[kk:A][jm:B][ip:C]TR[dp][cq]C[W leaves the weak stone hanging

buckyyowza: white can use "sute ishi" for remote thickness here, but h3 is poorly placed for that. possible points of reduction for white could be A (l9) or B (k7).  there is no point in looking at that stone as weak, it has good aji (although it is disconnected and dead, it may still be of use in play).   you are right, though: although joseki, white is not playing apropriately here. the marked stones could live easily without this play, and black can take good advantage of sente now with an upper shoulder hit at C (j4) to reduce white's influence.]

buckyyowza: it is too early for this fight, why not take easy points at A (f17) or B (d13). to fight here, allow the marked stones to live with big rewards for black. start at C (k6) or D (l5) instead. there is a way of looking at things called "tewari," or seeing them in reverse.  imagine for a moment that k5 was already there and that j4 was just played by white.  black would be provoked to respond... but now it is white's turn.]

buckyyowza: w's play misses the mark. it only threatens the marked stones. black play at a (n4) is enough to connect, and w's group would be left hanging behind a black sector line (from f5 to q16).]

C[buckyyowza: ATARI!  although these stones can't live, both players act as if they are alive throughout the middle game ;-)  this is situation is called "atsui"... meaning here that black has thick shape facing the center and that all of white's aji is gone.  technically, though, the aji is not fully gone, see var on b133.]

C[Ladder...
*...which is against me. M7 looks exceedingly good for W nov

buckyyowza: these stones (marked with triangle) are dead, and are bad aji for white. m7 is an attacking move, but the l6 group has no basis for attack. white should strengthen with A(l7) instead.]
;W[km];B[dl]TR[hq][hp][ip][jp]C[*Maybe seeking safety for M6 group and central territery is better, or an extension, or kakari at C14.

buckyyowza: these stones are dead ;-)  all of black's stones are safe now and he has his pick of places to start beating up on white. d8 is a fine choice. c14 is nice, but gives white a pincer at c12 at this point, so i'd avoid it for now.]
;W[cl];B[cf];W[fd]
(;B[ci]LB[cj:A]C[buckyyowza: c11 is a small lower shoulder hit.  that's usually a bad idea.  black is restrictive in his selection here.  playing at A (c10) would force white to choose which way your invasion will succeed.  at c11, black chooses the way that works best for white :-)]

C[keeps sente and safens M6 group];W[jl];B[jk];W[ik]
(;B[lk]LB[kk:A]C[buckyyowza: black is trying to strengenth his thickness against the right side and prevent white from escaping from the lower side.  your move accomplishes these things fine, but if you play at a (l9) instead of m9, you also eliminate the atari white is about to play.]
;W[jj];B[kk];W[hj];B[hl]LB[nc:A][hd:B]C[buckyyowza: white is already out, and black is already alive.  therefore this play is better left for the endgame or a liberty shortage attack. this sort of play is called "aji keshi," literally "erasing taste," or "spoiling possibilities."  since black has sente at this point, it would be better to take big points at A (o17) or start an attack as with B (h16).

this stage of the middle game seems to be where players around your level really start to get confused and locked in to local situations.  just like in the opening and the endgame, the final score is what is really important in go.  always try to assess how many points you have, how many points your opponent has, and how to either close or maintain the gap.

in this game, black has large potential on the right side, and has reduced white's potential by quite a bit.  right now, i'd estimate a 40 point lead for black, a very coarse count :-)  it is therefore white's turn to attack, and probably best for black to think about playing it safe (i.e. strengthening the upper right corner area).  you will get plenty of opportunity to fight when white decides to even up the score.]

buckyyowza: don't forget that the marked stones are dead, white is actually in trouble here, not black.  if you are afraid, you will lead your opponent to safety. in the variations, you will see white living small and black strongly shielding the right side.]

buckyyowza: this is a good time to take another coarse count to decide an approach for the late middle game:

black: 68.0
white: 44.5

so white has recovered about 15 points, and black still wants to find large defensive plays.
 m16 is a large defensive play :-)  it puts a bit too much pressure on white's upper side without giving black much attack potential, so it is probably better to play a little tighter here, i'd play at o17 or use something like A (j11) or B (k14) to break into the undecided center area.  strength there can lead to a handy upper side or upper left corner invasion.]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[kc];B[lg]LB[cc:A][qc:B][mf:C]C[buckyyowza: a little unneeded.  i'd start to consider a corner invasion at A (c17) or protect your own at B (r17).  if you want to play in this area, try protecting against n16 cut by building a ladder with C (n14), or simply playing at n16]

buckyyowza: an honest mistake.  i think i saw a similar mistake in a pro game not too long ago (really!).  since this puts the score quite in white's favor, i'll end my review here. a quick count reveals that without this blunder, you'd win by 11.5.

both players seemed to want to push this into a fighting game.  that is fine, but you both seemed to get nervous, stop fighting  and start drawing lines to wrap things up. it is usually best to choose your battles wisely ;-)  always base your decisions on coming out ahead in the end.  that is, if you are ahead by a large margin, avoid risky battles and work on solidifying your claim.  if you are behind by a large margin, come up with a good plan for getting ahead... that plan always involves fighting.   i'd suggest two things for you to work on thinking  about when playing:

1)  what is the score?  you don't have to base your count on reality ;-)  just try to take some time to look over the board EVERY time you are in sente, or whenever you realize that you're only protecting a handful of points.  decide what you think is yours and what you think is your opponent's.  this is how you decide which part of the board to play in. i like to leave the finer points of getting the score down to fractions of a point up to the pros and just eyeball it.  your eyeball can get pretty good with practice.

2) how many liberties do i have? how many does my opponent have? in close battle, just count the liberties of the fighting groups.  earlier (b39), you were concerned about a group with 3 liberties that was being attacked by a group with 1.  that means white would have needed to move 3 times without black paying attention in order to kill that group.  you can find out a lot of interesting things about a situation by taking a moment to count the liberties on all of the groups involved.

thanks for the opporunity to look over your game. i hope that you find my comments useful and not too critical.  always take my advice for what it is worth, i am by no means an expert on the game of go ;-)  if you have any questions about this review, or would like a handicap/teaching game, please feel free to contact me at mark@accessidaho.org, or look for "wonk" on IGS.]
