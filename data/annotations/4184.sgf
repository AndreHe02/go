DLW: Review by DimitriLW (5k* on IGS).  Comments preceded by "DLW:".  As I am only 5k, please take each of my comments with a healthy dose of skepticism, and consider them more as "ideas to provoke your own thoughts" than as "answers".]

C[DLW: I am not fond of this white stone.]
(;B[pe];W[qb];B[qi];W[jp]C[DLW: Again, I do not like this white stone.  While this play is big, Go wisdom argues for "urgent plays before big plays". For W to ignore upper-right corner seems to give B permission to begin a series of moves in that region and steer the direction of the game too easily.]
;B[dj];W[fc]C[DLW: Again, not entirely fond of W's stone.];B[hc]
C[DLW: Good.];W[db];B[cc];W[cb];B[fe]C[DLW: This stone feels mis-directed.  If B's aim was to contain W, then move 15 should not have been at C17.  If B's aim is territory on the left side, as the C17 stone seems to indicate, then This stone would be better at D14.]
;W[ed]C[DLW: Again, I'm not fond of this stone.  G16 is the easy play for W.]
;B[de]C[DLW: Oops.  E15 is the only option, in my opinion.]
;W[ee];B[df];W[ef]C[DLW: At this point, the F15 stone looks useless.]
;B[eg];W[ff];B[mb]C[DLW: I'm not very fond of this play.  It seems too local.  It secures B's group, and forces W to respond, but it is not giving B any strength to utilize elsewhere on the board.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[nd];B[ql]C[DLW: Too small, and gote.];W[qn]C[DLW: W choses to respond to B's last stone.  This response is also gote.]
;B[cm];W[bj]C[DLW: Unreasonable.]
(;B[bh]C[DLW: This doesn't feel right.  C11 appears to be the place to play.  All alternative move trees are just rough, sloppy examples. Don't take them as "tried and true" samples of how to play.]
;W[ci];B[ch];W[di];B[ei];W[dh];B[dg];W[eh];B[fh]C[DLW: Clearly this won't work for B.  This move is the beginning of B's woes.  B is building weak stones for W to attack and seperate. If W responds well, B will end up with seperated and weak groups, and W will end up with strength from which to fight throughout the game.]
;W[ej];B[fi];W[dk];B[bi];W[cj];B[bp]C[DLW: B is now fighting for life.  W could even opt to let B live in lower-left corner, but enclose him.]
;W[cq];B[bq]
(;W[gq]C[DLW: This stone just doesn't seem right.  Locally it is fine, but it is not taking into consideration the strength that W currently has.  If W opts to enclose B in the corner, B has a nearly impossible game -- in my humble opinion.  Alternative move trees are merely hypothetical demonstrations, and are not thoroughly thought out.

DLW: Regardless, we're beginning to see the difficulty that B is experiencing due to having seperated and weak groups.]
;B[eq]C[DLW: This stone appears unreasonable.  W is allowing B to run out -- take the opportunity.]

(;W[ep]C[DLW: W is kind.  C2 appears to work.];B[cr];W[dq]C[DLW: Small.  Good time to tenuki.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[kp];W[nq];B[jq];W[ip]
(;B[jr]C[DLW: ?  This stone does not seem to ensure space for 2 eyes. In fact, I do not think that B has room to make 2 eyes easily if W encloses B.  Perhaps placing this stone elsewhere will make running out to safety an easier task?]
;W[lq];B[kq];W[lp];B[ko];W[jj];B[hr]C[DLW: Small.];W[hq]C[DLW: Small.]
;B[qp]C[DLW: I think this play is an overplay by B.  It gives B two very weak positions in the same region of the board, and W can build strength attacking this stone to enable an attack against lower-center stones.  For that matter, I'm not even certain that this stone should live.  If W plays Q5, B's survival in corner looks difficult -- and definitely not worth the strength that the ensuing fight-for-survival will give to W in region.

DLW: Bottom line, B already has two relatively weak groups on bottom of board, and is now building a third.]

DLW: Closing comments: 

DLW: Both B and W often make plays looking at local positions, but not appearing to consider whole-board strategy.  B often makes invasions which are deeper than necessary.  W had many opportunities in middle of game to completely end the game, and B was fortunate that W did not capitalize on them.  Also, B made a few key misplays in fighting strategy (such as on left side).

DLW: I applaud B's willingness to fight and to seek opportunities to invade and/or create aji in opponent's shapes.  Such fighting spirit is commendable, however you must ensure that your invasion does not lead to the creation of a weak group.  This was an overriding theme for B throughout the game.  Almost every time I note an opportunity for W's play in the game, it is because B has weak groups on the board that can be pressed against.  Note that in the end, B has been seperated into 6 groups: 5 living and 1 dead (lower right).  Meanwhile W has a single strong living group. I'm not certain that it is entirely reasonable to expect to have 6 living groups when the opponent has a single large one -- it seems inevitable that one or two of the 6 groups will die, thus handing victory to the opponent.

DLW: Continue to play, observe, and study Go, and your skill will rise significantly!  Thank you for sharing your game with me, and if you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to ask.]
