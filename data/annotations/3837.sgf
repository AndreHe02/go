C[I seem to have really blown it with this game.  My opponent basically left me without a clue.

After he removed liberties, it left the game at 39.5 (me) to 183 (my opponent).

xedover: I hope my review is helpful to you. I may throw a lot of stuff at you, don't worry about it too much. Just concentrate on a few of your biggest weaknesses and keep practicing.

first, a little terminology correction -- your opponent removed your "dead stones" not your "liberties"

second, it would be a great help if for your next game review, you first review it yourself, adding some comments about what you were thinking/planning. That way the reviewer could help correct your thinking, not just your moves

Some of the main areas where you can improve are these:
1) protect your cuts
2) look for bigger moves that have at least one or more purpose:
    a) trying to expand your own territory
    b) trying to reduce your opponent's territory
    c) defending your own territory (see #1 above)
    d) attacking your opponent

while your opponent was perhaps a little stronger, you could have beat him if you hadn't given him to many opportunities :)

I hope this review was helpful to you.];B[qd]C[GreyFalkon: good day]

(;W[dc]CR[jd][ce]LB[cd:A]C[xedover: this stone doesn't work well with your other stone. you are inviting your opponent to divide your stones and cut you to pieces

this stone wants to enclose the corner at c15 and then extend along the top side

you should have instead played at A (but don't worry too much about this one yet)]
;B[oc]CR[pj]C[xedover: notice how your opponent takes his corner with a possible extension toward his other stone]
;W[ip]LB[di:B][dj:A]C[xedover: a play at A or B would have been bigger, helping to solidify the left side and letting your stones work together

you've invited your opponent to separate your groups now.];B[cj]
C[xedover: and so he does :)];W[qj]C[xedover: invading so deep into your opponent's territory just continues to invite him to divide and conquer your own weak stones

for now, just concentrate on keeping your stones together and not letting them get separated from one another]
;B[ce]
(;W[cd]LB[gd:A][dg:B]C[xedover: avoid making contact plays. it gives your opponent the upper hand

go take some territory for yourself (A), or try to pinch him in (B)]
;B[de]SQ[bf][cf][df][ef]C[xedover: see, all you did was to help your opponent to build his wall, strengthening his position]
;W[fd];B[jd];W[cm]C[xedover: at this point, the game is still even, and you actually still have a slight advantage so far.]
;B[qg];W[pk]CR[qg]LB[qm:A][qn:B][mp:C][nq:D]C[xedover: huh? what was the purpose of that move?

it doesn't gain you any big territorial points, nor does it threaten your opponent in any way

your opponent just grabbed a small chunk of territory with his move at r13 -- and threatens your stone at r10 also. your move says to him "here, go take some more away from me"

a play a A or B is your biggest, and most urgent move -- it (1) increases your territory, (2) strengthens your r10 stone, and (3) threatens your opponent's corner stone.

wow, a three purpose move!

always try to have at least one or more purposes for each of your moves! Q9 did nothing for you.]
;B[qm]C[xedover: since you didn't seem to want that spot... now your opponent has a clear lead in the game, and your two stones there are weak and in need of rescuing -- they have no base for eyes.]

but playing at B would have been even bigger

(see the variations)];B[ij];W[ql]LB[hc:A][mj:D][om:C][lq:B]
C[xedover: too small, look for bigger moves];B[pm];W[pl]CR[qk]
C[xedover: no need to connect these yet, because if black plays there first, you can always connect on the other side

by not extending out into the center, you are allowing black to surround you and limit your influence.]

(;W[ed]LB[ef:A]C[xedover: this move is useless, it will merely force him to strengthen his own wall

perhaps better, would have been to threaten to connect from the other side, then he'll still want to connect to prevent you from pushing through, but now you'll have time to make something happen on the other side perhaps.]

[ah][bh][ch][ai]C[xedover: the two marked groups are dead, they each only have one eye -- the two surrounded liberties are together only one eye, not two eyes.

without two eyes, you opponent will eventually reduce you to zero liberties and capture those stones

but, its not necessary to completely capture and remove the stones to score the game, because the score would remain unchanged -- so its just wasted time and effort to continue. That's why the dead stones are left on the board and removed at the end of the game.]
