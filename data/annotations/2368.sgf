C[Hi , i am Abbio (Black)
i would like to know something on fuseki and middle game
of this game, thank you.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ec];B[oc];W[qo]

;B[qi];W[rp];B[rq];W[oh];B[ro]C[S5 doesn't help you a lot, it only secores points and it weakens the r9 stones. Better simply play at r12 ou r13.]
;W[rn];B[sp];W[qn]TR[qn][rn]C[Black secured the corner but in exchange the 2 white stones are weakening the black middle group.]
;B[qg];W[pm]
(;B[mo]C[This move is a little bit slow.
Maybe you shoyuld play faster and approach at F3 for example.]
;W[dj]TR[mo][np]C[White should play d10 at g3 to counter black forces in this area.

Black should try to develop the 2 delta stones and approach at f3 or f4.]
;B[cd];W[de];B[ce];W[df]
(;B[cf]C[This move is not a good idea. you should jump as early as possible. See variation at C13.]
;W[dg];B[jd]C[maybe better at K17.];W[dd]C[This is very slow, white cannot afford to play here. Should be locally at C13  or h17. G3 is also a very big move..]
;B[cc]C[1st, this is not a good idea., as your move doesn't threaten anything, it only makes points. 
Second, locally is it better to jump at c12, as you enter white area.
3rd, your group is alive, you don't need to add a move to be alive. so maybe it's better to approach at f3.]
;W[cg]C[Black is enclosed. this is a good result for white.]
;B[db]C[Too slow. Black should approach the last corner at f3.]
;W[jp]C[Good idea, but a little bit too close from black stones.]
;B[cq]TR[dj][dp][jp]C[This invasion seems ok.
But the mistakes are earlier : C17 and D18.];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq]

(;B[of]TR[jd]C[It seems better to me to take an extension at  g17. The delta stone is isolated, you should try to secure a life. See variation.]
;W[jc];B[mf];W[nn];B[mn];W[id]
(;B[je]C[This is too slow. Because, you doesn't respond locally at k17, you should play k16 very lightly : see variation.]
;W[ie];B[jf];W[mc];B[rm]LB[if:B][lg:D][jh:C][im:A]C[Too slow. The center is now the focus of the game. better at a, b, c or d.]
