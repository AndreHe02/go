The Capturign


Tuomas: Hi, I am Tuomas, 4 kyu from Finland. Lets see what I can get out from this record.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[qo]TR[qk][pq]C[This seemed really unorthidox to me
What is the Best 20 Opening moves that you would suggest...

Tuomas: It is actually quite common plan. For amateurs this is used most to prevent the Chinese Fuseki. If you are not familiar with it I recommend studying it a lot. It is very commonly used. That fuseki goes so that white takes the upper left corner and black plays R9 getting so called Chinese enclosure to bottom right corner.]
;B[mp];W[pl];B[nc]LB[dd:1][pi:2]C[Tuomas:  It is better to take the corner by playing 1. It is big poin in itself and if white plays between it and R16 black can still build nice frameworks and use 2 to harash white.

The rythm of this game is clear, both Black and White play fast moves leaving small openings in their long jumps. Key points are now the upper left corner and right side. Side is important because if black plays there his corner becomes very powerfulll and if white plays his right side group settles nicely.]
;W[od]LB[oc:1][pc:3][pf:2]TR[nc][pl][qo]C[Tuomas: This is too early in my opinion. Because black made wide corner enclosure this corner is still weak. The obvious black response would be 1. It takes the corner and gives white nice wall towards the righ side. Fair trade but a little passive from black perspective.

I think that 2 looks interesting. Black could plan to treat marked stone lightly and push for right side. This forces white to defend his marked group on the right and black gets time to grab the corner. White will have hard time to make good shape for his group at P16. Perhaps before playing 2 black could close the corner with 3. If white does not defend the bottom right group he will face serious attack sooner or later.]
;B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[rd]LB[re:1]TR[od][pd]C[This sort of seemed too slow
SO is there other josekis that could be played here
Also was playing Counter Hane Appropriate...instead of S16

Tuomas: Slow or solid, nothing bad in that. But shape is a little weak as we see later when white plays the hane at T16.  Black is taking nice bullet proof territoryand white is getting a wall towards his group. 

The double hane doesn't look good in my opinion. White gets strong shape from it and the ladder that would capture marked white stones doesn't work well.]
;W[re]LB[pe:1][pi:2][qm:3]C[Tuomas: white got a nice wall but it has a big hole at 1. Black can also invade this easily by playing somewhere around 2. With third weakness at 3 we can consider this white framework fairly bulnerable.

Black corner is strong so black can attack to 1 right away if he wants to have a dog fight but it is better to use it indirectly.]
;B[nd]LB[of:1][pi:2]C[Tuomas: This builds nicely the upper left side but it also allows white to fortify his right side. I dont like this but it is doable plan. Main fault is that the upper left corner is still open and after this black must get it. Taking the corner is the default move in this situation.]
;W[pf]LB[of:1]C[Tuomas: Wrong shape, white should play 1.];B[oe]
LB[dd:1][pi:2]C[Tuomas: These two white stones are not that important.  At the moment they are only 4 points. Black should take the corner or invade somewhere around 2. Corner is better.]
;W[pe]LB[dd:1][oi:2]C[Tuomas: This is way too slow for white. He should take the corner or at least form a major framework with 2. This was just 4 point gote that has low priority even on end game.]
;B[of]LB[ne:1]TR[oe]C[Tuomas: White shape is bad but so is black. The cut at 1 is dangerous and marked stones are getting heavy.]
;W[sd];B[rc]LB[rb:1]C[Tuomas: Here that earlier bad shape plays out. White 1 is common tesuji but here it doesn't work. Instead of this black usually plays at 1 but here there is not so big difference.]
;W[og]LB[pg:1]TR[oe][of]C[Also Is there any I should be focusing on (Black) after defending

Tuomas: White shape is a little too weak for this hane. Black cut at 1 is interesting direct attack but black has to be carefull with his marked stones if he tries that. White should play 1 or some other defensive stone.]
;B[ne]LB[dd:1][mf:A][ng:B][pg:2]C[Tuomas: Too slow. If black wants to defend this cut he should play A. After that black can either take the corner with or try to attack white with 2 depending on what white does.

Black B is a bad plan because it forces white to fix his shape on the right side.]
;W[ng]LB[mf:A]C[Tuomas: White framework is getting strength and black shape looks clumsy. If black had played A previously, he would have a lot better position to counter this move. White shape is also bad but this helps it a bit.]
;B[sc];W[se];B[jc]LB[gc:2][jc:A][cd:B][ed:1]C[would B have been better than A

Tuomas: A is way too slow, it is fundamentally wrong way to use a wall like that. Black should play to corner, but which corner move is correct?

You suggested B but it looks dangerous to me. It invites white to play 1 and for that the only possible move would be pincer. That fight would be good for black so white wont do that. Instead white plays 2 ruining black framework. Now black will have hard time to develop that corner and he wont have any real attack against white.

Here black should play either hoshi at D16 or he could even dare to play E17 or E16. E16 most likely better because it works better against the white bottom left corner. By playing like this black makes sure that if white invades between wall and his corner black will either have very powerfull attack on white or a very large corner.]
;W[dd]LB[fd:A]C[Tuomas: White took the key point. If black would play around A we could see that Black top side and White right side are more or less equal. And because the last corner is held by white hoshi, white has the advantage.]
;B[gq]C[Tuomas: This is nice direction but perhaps playing between white hoshi stones would be more efficient.]
;W[jq]C[Tuomas: Dangerous attack. White can't settle here and if white continues to play in here this stone becomes heavy group that restricts white playing for the rest of the game.]
;B[dr];W[lr];B[mr];W[hr];B[gr];W[lq];B[mq];W[lp];B[po]LB[qm:1]
C[Tuomas: This is bad idea. By touching white stone you force white to defend it. This way the weakness at 1 gets fixed. It is better to play little closer to the center to force white to defend the center group. Then you can perhaps launch powerfull attack against right side. Capturing the bottom group will be very very hard so better not to count on it.]
;W[qq]LB[pn:1]C[Tuomas: Dangerous move. I would suggest 1 or some other defensive move. White should aim to build his framework while keeping some presure on black corner so that it wont grow too big.]
;B[qr];W[rq];B[rr];W[pn];B[qp];W[rp];B[pp];W[rn]LB[qj:2][qm:1]
C[Tuomas: As we see later in the game this is not the best alternative. The peep at 1 would play nicely with invasion around 2 if black somehow gets central influence to support his attack.]
;B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[ln]LB[nm:1]C[Tuomas: Here white should play 1. It makes his right side framework very strong. The white bottom group should be able to sustain little more presure before it needs to be defended.]
;B[lo]C[Tuomas: Direct attack against this kind of group is useless. It is a lot better to leave the situation open and play elsewhere. Then something might happen that makes your attack more dangerous.]
;W[ko];B[mo];W[jn]C[Tuomas: White calmly pushes to center while making eye shape. He has nothing to be afraid at the moment.]
;B[nm];W[nl]TR[om][pn][qo]C[Tuomas: The marked white stones look a little funny.]
;B[cq]C[Tuomas: This is big point and now black group is settled.]
;W[cp];B[go];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[fo];B[fp]LB[hn:2][hq:1]
C[Tuomas: Again too straightforward. Black could connect his stones with 1 or 2.]
;W[ep];B[hp]C[Tuomas: Connect and keep yourself strong. Then you can attack sooner or later. This is very bad idea.]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[dn]C[Tuomas: White gets nice shape that works fairly well with the upper left corner.]
;B[fm];W[en]LB[em:1]C[Tuomas: No reason to play like this. Just play 1 and start making huge side framework.]
;B[em];W[dm];B[el]LB[cf:2][ek:3][gm:1]C[Tuomas: There is one nasty cut left behind but black should be able to live with it. Now he needs to be faster than this. Either approach the corner from 2 or at least jump a little bit further with 3.]
;W[dl]C[Tuomas: Black shape is painfull. White starts to look good again.]
;B[ek];W[hl]LB[dk:1][gm:2][gp:3]C[Tuomas: Don't peep at cutting point, either cut it or stay clear. If white would plya at 1 the cut would become very dangerous for black. If white cuts directly black should aim to take 1 as soon as possible. The ko fight could cause some problems for him in this way.]
;B[hm];W[gl];B[im]C[Tuomas: This is bad ideay, just connect to maintain your attacking power. Playing like this gives very powerfull attacks for white.]
;W[gm];B[in]TR[ek][el][em][fm]C[Tuomas: Black would have nice attacking opportunities but his shape is a bit weak. If he attacks his defense will be under heavy strain. The unnecessary ko is giving so much trouble for black.]
;W[gj]LB[dj:1]TR[ek][el][em][fm]C[Tuomas: Deadly move, black canot let marked stones to die, he must protect those. White would like to attack from 1 but that way groups would run across the board and his bottom side group could get in trouble so this is better.]
;B[ei];W[ir];B[ip];W[jp];B[jm];W[km];B[lm];W[kl];B[mn];W[kn]
C[Tuomas: White calmly keeps his stones under control.];B[ll]
LB[jk:1]C[I would suggest 1 instead. It cuts the white center group from its only support and puts it under severe attack. There will be little fighting in center but white should be able to handle it. During that fight black should make sure that he lives with the weak group on the left and ruins all territory that white might get on left side.]
;W[mk]C[I think white should have played at M9

Is it better

Tuomas: Correct. That is the key point to break black shape.]
;B[lk];W[mj];B[lj];W[kk];B[mi];W[ni];B[ml];W[nk];B[mh];W[nh]
LB[jk:1]C[Tuomas: Here black fortified the white side and almost forced white to connect his weak center group to safety. Black stones don't make any territory and dont really cut anything so it is very bad result for black. 

The earlier cut at 1 would have been better. Black could still try something in that direction.]
;B[ih]LB[fc:4][mf:2][ek:3][ik:1]C[Tuomas: Fairly weak move. White can connect his weak group by playing somewhere around 1 and there is hole in black wall that makes it hard for black to get points from here. If he plays 2 now white can still develop his corner by playing around 4 to counter it.

Black could still try to cut with 1 although it is very hard fight for him now. If not that then he needs to protect the weak group at 3.]
;W[pj]LB[fc:1][cj:3][ik:2]C[Tuomas: White shape is bad but this does little to fix it. There are still lot of important moves waiting.]
;B[kj];W[gh]C[Tuomas: Running is usually good alternative for connecting, but here having running group makes it hard for white to get more territory from upper left corner and left side. It is better to connect to bottom group and focus on gaining more points.]
;B[mg];W[ik];B[cf]LB[fd:1][ci:2]TR[ei]C[Is there better BIG moves that I can makes if so please explain...

Tuomas: The big move would be 1 because that way black top side would have more room to grow. But that would leave the weak black group in bad situation. The connection between marked black stones is a little thin so white should try to attack it now that his groups are strong.

White could perhaps try to attack with 2 or some similar move. Very tricky situation.]
;W[ce];B[ee];W[ed];B[fe];W[fd];B[gd];W[gf];B[ge]LB[eg:1]C[Tuomas: This exchange hurts white corner. Now he wont be able to make as much territory there. White should try to cut at 1.]
;W[hf]LB[hg:1][ig:2]C[Tuomas: Perhaps 1 would be better. Or even 2.]
;B[if];W[he];B[ie];W[ji];B[jh];W[ki];B[kh];W[jj];B[li];W[gc]

C[Tuomas: White cut at 1 is dangerous.]
(;W[be];B[de];W[cc]LB[ch:2][ci:3][dj:1]C[Tuomas: This is over cautious. White has lot of interesting alternatives.]

;W[sp];B[fp];W[sr];B[pr];W[nf];B[mf];W[gp]LB[qm:1]C[Tuomas: Never play this kind of ko. Connect. You have nothing to win and everything to lose and you can get out from the situation very easily.

But lets pause here to analyze the weakness at 1. Check the basic variation for it.]

(;B[ss]LB[hq:1]C[Tuomas: Not enough, white will play 1 to start a ko that can win a game for him. This will have interesting effect to white framework though.]
;W[fp]LB[qm:2][hq:1]TR[ss]C[Tuomas: Instead of this white should have escalated the ko with 1. Or defend against 2.

Lets see the basic variation now that black has the marked stone.]

(;B[sq]LB[qm:1]C[Tuomas: This is the point where the weakness at 1 activates. Let see how it looks like now. (Variation start from white killing black center group.) 

Do I need to say that saving that center group would be very good move?]

(;W[qh]C[There are a few Variations that I put in With A so if there is any improvements that I could make On Letting the Black Group Live after A or Killing the White Group on right corner
... Please Look at my varations and see if any errors..
Thank you


Tuomas: Obviously this is not the big weakness in white framework. And there is one 26 point move on board that should decide the game for white. It is very hard to tell what is the best move for white in next black attack. White will lose something so it is all about controlling the damage and maintaining sente.]
;B[qm];W[rm]LB[ql:B][qn:A]C[K This is where I was sort of confused
A and B both were Appealing to me

Tuomas: If you play B situation is the same as before but white has one liberty more. White wins the semeai thanks to damezumari that prevents black from taking the last liberty.]

(;B[qn];W[ro]LB[ql:B][pm:A]C[K there I thought B would be better for me if i wanted to win the game. But I wasn't sure SO i went with A and lost at yose...
Please Respond to this question

Tuomas: Here black can use atari to gain one more freedom, which makes the basic situation back into ko. Black has local ko threat and white loses the ko. So white cant play the basic variation and he must try to limit his losses. I don't study the white moves that much. I just show that he can't fully block the black attack.]

--Thomas Ben

Tuomas: Black lost because he gave the upper left corner to white. Black almost lost the game when his group in left side became weak and if white had been more daring this group would have been under severa attack. Black almost won the game because he was more daring and offensive.

White was stronger on strategy and planing, black was stronger in close combat. Two points for black to study are:
- flow of stones in opening and how to make and break frameworks and
- how to handle weak groups.
