Hi Vose, I'm Daniele (moria31 on KGS). I've marked all my comments with ****, I hope you will find them useful. you have my email, so if you have some question just ask!

I think you made a good beginning, the timing and direction were good, it seems that till the middle game the outcome was good. Than with move 51 arise your problems at the bottom. I showed you some way to handle it, but after that the situation wasn't so good for you, even though you could save the bottom-left corner.
Concerning the end-game, there weren't such big points, the game was already seattled. I've only found some unnecessary moves and a mistake at move 211.

Daniele



Thank you very much for reviewing my game. I am black in this game. I made two very large mistakes in the middle game and lost two groups. For one of them I simply did not read the  ladder correctly and should have spent the time to read it out. For the other group I don't know how I should've handled it. Also in the end the game I don't know if I could have found an extra three points to win the game.

I would like to know if my timing was correct when I moved to the bottom right corner. Also how to handle my group on the left. And if there was anyway to fight out with the middle group or did I make a shape error. Also any advice as far as direction or timing and of course if I missed anything obvious that you see.

I included some comments and questions along these lines throughout the game.

Thank you

I think white move here and in the bottom-right corner are not joseki, the outcome will  be good for you]

;B[kd]TR[qd]C[V.. My thought was to eliminate the thickness of this wall or the influence

****
this move is good, it prevents white from building large territory facing the wall, and, at the same time, works good with your corner stone.
Obviously white will take something on the left side, but there is still room for an invasion and you have already made some points in the corner.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[ci];B[di];W[eh];B[bg]C[V.. Is it best to protect my cut this way

****
yes];W[bh];B[cg];W[bi];B[dj];W[ck]
(;B[qp]TR[bh][bi][ci][ck]C[V.. I felt the timing was good to move to the other corner?

****
the timing is good, your two stones aren't dead and you can still attack the marked group later]

Even now they can easily survive and help you kill the white group]

since your 3-stones group is surrounded, G3 would be safer]

maybe you can leave the stones for later, they're too weak
it's better to save your group in the bottom first];B[ml];W[hq]
CR[hr][hp]C[****
This is a common pattern, it occurs several times during a game
usually there are two ways of responding to this small invasion:
if you attack from below you can connect on the top and vice versa]
