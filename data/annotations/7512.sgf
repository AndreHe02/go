C[Hello. I am white :) This game was played on the dragon go server, so there was enough time to think about every move. Despite, I could not deal with my opponent's opening.

Reviewer:::Xinwen
hello, I'm your reviewer, Xinwen, i'm always on KGS. I'll try my best to review the game, thank you very much!

nice to meet you :-)

First of all, your game was pretty "high-level" does not look like a double-digit kyu, you gave in a lots of thought in the game - congratulation ^^^

In order to make a decent review for your game, i have take this as a study with my friends in KGS without your permission - sorry!

From this game, you had a bad start, you worked hard to fight back and didn't work well. So maybe the advice is to speed up in Fuseki development

Special thanks for reviewing together

hiuhiu];B[qd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[pj]LB[np:b][op:A]C[Xinwen::: First of all, Black had played a very rather unusual opening, with komokus facing the hoshi stones.

Someone suggested to play lightly at "b" which is also possible.]

(;W[oq]C[would it be better to play high?

Xinwen::: Most of the time, we would choose:- faster, opportunity to expand (fuseki theory), thus i think it would be better to play high.

According to your move P3 (third line), first impression, you want profit.]

(;W[qj]C[I looked for a good invasion point and i thought a corner aproach would give him the whole right side as terythory and probably create a weak group of mine

Xinwen::: First of all, you should look at the position of the whole board.

Fuseki result:-
White has 2 corners, one strong group

Black has one corner on top right - influence to the top (side)
Black has 1/2 corner on the bottom right - influence to the right (side)
Black has a group on the bottom

Conclusion, White is behind in Fuseki.];B[qi];W[pi];B[qh];W[qk]

(;W[on]LB[mm:a]C[Xinwen::: in my opinion P6 is not necessary especially when the stiuation is not in favour for White, and P6 is not really a cut

If you insisted to cover up the P6, i would recommend "a" lighter and flexible]
