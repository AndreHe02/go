C[Hi steve,

welcome to the review :D

I'm Yaoundee (on kgs) 
In the main branch my comments are marked with 'Y'

I hope l can help to improve your playing-style!]
(;B[qd]C[thanks for taking the time to review this game.

so i'm not happy with my typical opening of 2 4-4 points; it never seems to secure the corner & that second move of 3-3 or 4-2 seems small.

Y: Well I do not quite understand what you say about the second move (was "4-2" a typo?) but I'll give you a bit of opening theory.

hoping to follow up with P17 and then extension to Q10.];W[qq]
;B[cd]LB[jc:A][jd:B]C[I'm not sure if these 2 stones work together.

Y: me neither. It seems unconventional to me. With White I would play at A or B directly, because I don't want black to play there since the center  becomes very attractive for both sides]
(;W[dq];B[ec]C[now looking at extension to D10; secondarily K16


Y: good plan. But you should also take the white stones into consideration ;)]
;W[oc]
(;B[pf]TR[ec][cd]C[i also considered N17,  but i feel uncertain about pincer moves.  is the point just to chase white out into the middle?  with this move i was trying to make a base on side.

Y: This is good only locally. You better use your thickness (marked stones). But still a good idea.]
;W[hc]LB[kc:B][lc:A][qc:C]C[Y: Your opponent seems to have less knowledge of (or care for) Fuseki/Joseki. Normal would be an extension at A or B or the contact play C.
Instead he comes very close to your thickness. You should exploit that and cut him immediately. A, B is possible but I would prefer a play on the on the fourth line]
;B[dj];W[lc]C[Y: White repairs.];B[jq]LB[pc:B][od:C][qi:D][co:A]
C[here i also considered something along the right side, but this seemed bigger to me.

Y: the bottom is not so interesting because of both corner stones standing low.
The big points are elsewhere. I would begin with the approach at A (you already have the fitting extension!). and when white extend on the bottom Black B, White C, Black D and White's overconcentrated on the top.]
;W[cg];B[cm]C[trying to balance a low move with a higher one.  would c5 be a better move; approaching the corner?

Y: Indeed, C5 would be much better, The idea of balance is good but what you aim for is a light, flexible shape (Takeo Kajiwara 9-dan calls it 'light territory') therefor the extension should be a bit farther.
Secondly White threats to enclose the corner with C5 (and attack you at the same time) so C6 isn't the right move either.
So C5 combines the light extension with an double-side attack on D3.]
;W[ci];B[cj];W[bi];B[bj]C[Y: you can't expect to kill white - at least not when you follow him on the 2. line while the way to center is still open. So spare B10 for later in case the white group comes really into trouble.
As for your own group you don't have to worry. You can just be thankful for White's contact play (but don't you wish now you would have made the extension a little farther?)]
;W[be]C[Y: you can be thankful about such a move. instead of extend to the center White forces you to close your own corner. From a strong (although cramped) position he enforces the potential prey.]
;B[bd];W[ce];B[oq]LB[pc:C][od:D][qi:E][gq:A][mq:B]C[trying to avoid always following the opponent.

Y: nothing bad in answering forcing moves, especially if they are helping you.
here you extend too far from your stone K3 and come to close to the 3-3 which is not really attackable.
Since A and B are miai why play on the bottom at all? C-D-E is still a big play. Also keep in mind that your top-left corner is weakened after White C15]
;W[po];B[qj]LB[qk:A]C[also considered M-N 4, but too small i think.

Y: very good move! White can't extend to A anymore.];W[ql]C[now i see this move makes M4 more necessary]
;B[nj]LB[oj:A]C[but i chose to move out into the center instead.

Y: the 2-point jump is quite loose in front of a white group. I see no reason for it. A is normal.]
;W[mq]
(;B[no]TR[po][mq]C[Y: knight move can be cut! the marked stones help the cutting]

(;B[gb]LB[gc:A][lo:B][oo:G][pp:E][qp:F][jq:C][oq:D]TR[dc][dd]
[gk][em][km][lm][en][fo][io]C[trying to get more room in the corner; maybe R18 would have been better?  Often my corners that look like upper left get invaded & killed...

Y: The problem with G18 is, that its a a shoulder hit from below on H17, so you're strenghtening white as well (white might cap your stone on A). Therefor consider to remove the marked weakness of the corner more directly.
r18 seems small because it is on the 3rd row and Gote (unlike Q17 which is Sente).
But actualy we're talking about the wrong side of the board. I can understand your worries about the corner. Though I'm sure it can't be killed with one move the invasion at C18 might be difficult to handle. Still you're in the middle of a big fight on the lower board side! 
After White secured his group at the right bottom corner he has only the one weak group of B left. But if you let him play there first your group of C will become the weaker one. So your stones are urging for a move in the marked area. You should consider to keep the initative and attack B while trying to connect your three groups. 
BUT to accomplish that plan you have to repair first: the stone at D can be cut. (See variation)]
;W[ib];B[gc];W[gd];B[fd];W[hd]C[Y: corner secured. Good job! Why to play there any longer? White is slightely ahead in territory, but by using your influence and attacking White's weak group you can surely win the game.]
;B[ge]TR[fe]C[Y: ...and why the hane, which leaves a cut? you can't attack that thick white group!]

[jr][hs][is]C[Ok, my impression is, your Fuseki is already well considerate. So try to improve it and you will easily gain advantage in the beginning of your games.
In the middle game I recommend you to be more forward and try to take the initiative. Keep in mind you can often sacrifice/exchange a corner. 
Moreover to loose a corner which was already defended happens also to strong players. It doesn't mean defeat if you get a compensation.
Finaly you should pay more attention at the endgame. Its good when you have some time left in the endgame, cause there's much to read and much to gain when the game is close.

(;B[np]LB[nn:E][lo:D][no:B][lp:C][mp:A][gq:F]TR[jq][oq]C[Y: why not the solid move?
N3 is nearly surrounded by the marked stone. if White A Black B. After White C or D Black jumps to E. The only problem with this tactic is that the 3 stones on the right are difficult to attack, in unlike k3. So why not leave p3 for the time beeing and first of all enforce K3 - with the extension on F for example?]
))
(;B[mc]LB[lc:A][qc:B][oe:C]C[A pincer does not only attack. 
First of all, this move restrains White's movements. More precisely White can't make a base at A anymore but can still make one with B. Through this contact play, white will strengthen r16 and itself and thereby weaken N17.
The jump at C however is not really for fleeing into the center but rather for cutting the black stones. This is certainly the difficulty with pincering that you have seperated your stones.
After White C you might want to defend your corner stone r16 first and thats where your pincer stone (N17) comes under attack. Therefor I like to have my pincer a little bit nearer to my friends at the upper left corner in such a situation.]
)
(;B[dj]TR[dq][qq]C[you wanted to play at d10 and thats still possible.]
;W[cn]C[if White closes the corner..];B[ld]TR[ec][cd][dj]C[you can pincer the White stone next. The idea of the pincer: it works well together with the simari (corner enclosure) in the upper left. the reason for its distance to p17: to make it harder for white to invade between pincer and shimari.
the reason for playing it high: because black e17 is low. but if you don't like to play influence-orientated you can of course play on the 3rd line as well. 
I'd like you to have a look on the nice framework the four stones are forming together. Wouldn't you like to play another move around tengen soon to build a moyo?
 
Now I'll show some possible joseki follow-ups from a book. They are very difficult for me too. But the important thing is to understand the principles of Fuseki not to know the Joseki.]
(;W[of]C[Though this move is Joseki, it isn't apropriate for the whole board situation, as you will see]

;B[rf];W[pc];B[re];W[oh];B[nd]TR[ld][mf]C[White's plan in this Joseki is to compensate the territory Black got on the right side by pincering the two marked stone. If the single pincer-stone would have back up to its left the outcome would probably be favourable for White. But since Black has two strong stones there he just has to enforce his stones with O16 and K16 is in deep trouble.]

(;W[nd]C[This is a better choice.];B[pf];W[qb];B[qi];W[jc]C[White invades.
The outcome is equal I guess])

;B[mc];W[nd];B[oe];W[lc]))
(;B[co]LB[do:A]C[Another idea would be to approach at c5 (or A). But be prepared for a pincer, cause if White simply extends on the bottom side Black will be happy about an extension not only from C5, but also from his shimari.
Mind that White stands low on the bottom. so an extension in that direction is not worth much.

However after white have played a pincer this stone has the black shimari in the back, so white can easily get into disadvantage.]
)
(;B[cn];W[cp];B[dj]C[..or this...]))
(;W[jc];B[lc];W[fc]LB[ec:B][gc:A][hc:C][nc:D]C[I play the 2-space-extension here, because I don't want to allow Black to close the corner at A and confine my stones from both sides. Of course this leaves the weakness at C, but at least Black has a similiar weak point at D.
Btw, the contactplay of Black B would not be good here, do you know why?

You could try out yourself what can happen in this position (for example if black plays on C now) and see if you like it with Black.]
)
(;W[dp];B[jd]LB[ec:A][oc:B][dg:C]C[This looks a bit like san ren sei (3 stones on the starpoints of one side) but like in the Chinese Opening White is already pincered when he plays the usual kakari though here not only on one but on both sides. So instead of playing A or B white can consider to approach at C or so.
Whatsoever I already felt uncomfortable with white.]))
(;B[pd]LB[jc:A][qj:B]TR[qc]C[the 4-4 is very flexible. the stone wants to develope as well in the direction of A as in the direction of B. It is influence-orientated and you can't expect to get much territory with it, because it has a weakness: the 3-3-point.]
(;W[cp]LB[eq:A]C[The 3-4 point is rather territory-orientated. It has a clear direction: here the bottom side, more precisely, the stone is waiting for the follow-up in the area of A. 
Also for black the approach at A or nearby is quite big, whereas it isn't clear yet how white should approach Blacks' 4-4 stone or how black would like to develope it. Which is dued to the flexibility of 4-4.]
)
(;W[pq]LB[po:A]C[this would be a bad move since it gives black the opportunity for an extraordinary big play: Black A serves for two purposes: it approaches the white corner (kakari) and at the same time developes the star point.]
