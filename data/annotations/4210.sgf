C[Rex: Thank you for reviewing our game. This was played on Dragon Go Server using the hidden comments feature. If you don't already know, this feature lets you hide your comments until the game is over and you download it. Only then do you see your comments. Marc proposed we do this for each of our moves as we played. It turned out to be a great idea. Very instructive even without the input of a reviewer. Now, though, we'd like the input of someone who knows what they're doing. Could you please make comments for Black and White? Once again, we appreciate your time.

LoP: The game was pretty easy to review since your comments were a great help. Most of the time you already answered open questions yourself and i just had to give some additional comments. 
Black: I think you follow around your opponent's move too much. Yous should try to dictate the game more. Try to force your opponent to follow your plan and try to get and hold the initiative. The good thing was that you didn't fall too much behind in the early parts of the game so that you could still catch up in the endgame where you played petty good.
White: You show surprisingly good analysis of the game state and correct thinking. I think that you can get quite a lot stronger in a short time if you get some practice (play many games)]
;B[pd]C[Rex A. Santoro: I usually begin with this move. I like to treat my oppoenet with respect which this  move is supposed to do.]
;W[pp]C[Marc: I let you chose parallel or crossed fuseki. Enjoy the game!]
;B[cd]C[Rex A. Santoro: This is my usual opening: hosi-3/4 point. If W plays in lower left, I will kakari.]
;W[dq]C[Marc: D3 seems well balanced to me, because we can each do a corner enclosure or an approach move.
If I had played C4, we still could have made corner enclosures, but D10 would be big for both of us, and you would be the one to get it, without compensation for me.]
;B[do];W[ec]C[Marc: Rex :
Possible moves I was thinking of: Bc4, d5, c10, f17, j16. Bc4: I usually get stung when I am pincered at Wc7, so I tend away from this. Bf17: too slow. Bj16: this would be the high Chinese opening, but I don't know how to use this. Bc10: seems too cautious. Bd5: if Wf4, Bc8/9.

Marc :
C5 was too kind, considering your stone at C16. I was tempted by E5, which could have worked well with Q4. Then I chosed E17 : you are approaching and I do the same. Not sure at all what will become of that (it seems more difficult to handle), but it doesn't seem bad, and I was eager to try.]

(;B[ee]C[Rex A. Santoro: Thought W would respond this way. If Wh16/17, Bd10; if Wf4, Bd8/9.

LoP: Interesting move, you could also think about a pincer like H16 or G16]

(;W[hc]C[Marc: I think your move is good (working well with D5), I would have better managed a pincer.
I think white's priority is to prevent being enclosed in top left corner, the more so as you have the stone at Q16. So H17 is my choice.
I wonder if I started something too complex for me!];B[fd]C[Rex A. Santoro: Didn't see this before. I'll try attacking these two stones building a wall and then playing d9/10]
;W[fc]C[Marc: good leaning : i feel forced to answer.];B[gd]
C[Rex A. Santoro: Going with plan of Wg17, Bd10.];W[cj]C[Marc: Well, I think you have a far better start than me.
If I defend again at G17 or H16, you will press on the other side : F4 or E3 and build a huge moyo. If I play elsewhere, you will push at G17 and end up with a big upper left corner or a moyo in the upper right. But I think I have to take that risk and do sth against your wall.
So again I play a move (C10) without knowing very well what will come out of it. We will see.
I will call it being flexible ;o)

LoP: Interesting idea to play tenuki here];B[cl]C[LoP: correct direction]

(;W[fp]C[Marc: difficult to decide between strengthening my stone at C10 by playing C13 or helping D3.
But I wouldn't like you to lean on D3 in sente and then approaching in O3 or O4. Then C10 will have to care for itself for a while.
Another wrong choice? (I'm always changing my mind)

LoP: I'd prefer jumping to the center with E10]
(;B[cp]C[Rex A. Santoro: Wanted to create a base for this group. Now I believe I can attack Wc10 even if he makes a 2-space extension.

LoP: C3 is the standard move here];W[cg]C[Marc: I think your move in C4 makes your 3 stones a bit crowded. I was expecting rather C3 (more pressure on D3), or a pincer on C10.
C3 looks like a defensive move where you could have attacked further.
So I get the opportunity to give a bit of fresh air to C10.]

(;B[eg]C[Rex A. Santoro: Let's see what happens when I attack this group. I think he cannot split Bc16 and Be15. If We10, then Bd11. I'll try and come out with sente to tenuki.]
;W[ej]C[Marc: In that kind of position, it is almost a reflex for me to jump into the center. I fear too much black moves like D9 or E10. In the follow-up, there might be some tricky move for me like D15 ... we will see.]
;B[el]C[Rex A. Santoro: I want to attack the Wc10 group, but this weakens the Bd6 group. Now however, with Be8, the Be16 group is getting weak.
LoP: So maybe you really want to attack from the weak group (bottom)  in the first place?]
;W[qf]C[Marc: You make your group stronger ...
so now both your groups have more thickness than mines. Something tells me that I should solidify somewhat too, or I am bound to be submitted to severe attack.
But, that big empty space on the other side!
I simply cannot resist.];B[pf]C[Rex A. Santoro: After Wq13, I could either Bp14 or r15. Hmmmmm. Let's see which joseki he'll choose. He'll come out of the attach-and-extend joseki with sente but then I plan to attack the upper group. Still have to be careful of my Be15 group.

LoP: huh? "...he will come out in sente but then i plan to attach the upper group", sounds illogical. If he comes out with sente he will continue to hold the initiative so you will not have the chance to do what you want.]
;W[pg]C[Marc: Here, i simply hope to end the sequence in sente, and then push forward with my H17 stone, in order to fix my group and limit your upper right at the same time.

LoP: As we see here white has the right kind of thinking. Black can't hope to do what he wants when white has sente.]
;B[of];W[qe]C[Marc: one standard follow up]
(;B[pc]C[Rex A. Santoro: Marc could cut and mayber cause problems. With this I want to make an extension to Bk17 or Bl17.

LoP: Bad move, the normal R16 is better territorially and not really worse regarding the q15 p15 p16 cutting sequence.]

(;W[ib]C[Marc: Ah, that's a question, because the only move I know in this position is R16, but you played Q17.
So is it a joseki that I don't know, or did you depart from the usual joseki with for a special purpose, or is your move a mistake (or at least not an efficient move)?
[LoP: inefficient yes\]

If it is a mistake, should I try to "punish" it, e.g. by playing S17 (pushing in where you should have blocked)?
[LoP: J18 is a nice thick move\]
[LoP: no, it's ok for white already, you had the right idea to defend your top group and make blacks outside influence on the top a bit useless. As it stands now you can always slide into S17 until the endgame. Black  usually doesn't want to invest another move in the top right corner (S16) because it's too small to take gote twice fo it.\]

 My feeling is that if you departed from the standard sequence, it is sort of playing tenuki, so I should be allowed to play tenuki too (we leave the joseki pending for now).
So I play J18 because it makes my group definitely stable and limits the influence of your Q17 wall.
[LoP: yes\]

But when I look at the goban, I'm still not too confident to leave R14 like that :o|]

(;B[kc]C[Rex A. Santoro: Why didn't he extend to l17? I wanted to do this anyway. Still need to be careful of upper left group.

LoP: L17 would be too thin, i think the best move for white there is J17, for black it would be K17, even now i like K17 better than L17 because it effects white's shape]
;W[ie]C[Marc: Here, I feel that I should split your groups. Isn't it a fundamental of Go?
I wonder if my shape is good.

LoP: good idea, black: observe that if you had L17 at K17 it wouldn't be so easy for white to jump to the center]

(;B[gf]C[Rex A. Santoro: Rats! Wj15 pressuers both groups. Maybe if he attacks to try for the corner I can give him Bc16, and cut off his Wc10 group. Now I've got to watch my upper right group.

LoP: G14 is definitly the correct move regarding shape, but my feeling is that it's a bit too slow, you should at least make it over the sector line between J15 and F10. If you play this way white can put pressure on you with H13.]

(;W[nq]C[Marc: You play a defensive move, so I could play one too, or a big move elsewhere. I go for a big move.

LoP: I usually prefer defending groups instead of going for territorially big moves. so i prefer G17 or C18 or S17 or R11. I think E10 is weakest especially after black made his E13 group stronger with G14 so i would play G10]
;B[db]C[Rex A. Santoro: Attack this group to make myself stronger, then go after the Wc10 group.

LoP: good plan]
(;W[jc]C[Marc: I told myself : this time I will make a defensive move: I haven't made enough of them until now. I don't want you to push with your UL group between 2 weaks groups of mine. I first thought of E18, but that was an ugly shape, so I went on the other side.]
;B[kd]C[Rex A. Santoro: He seems to make me stronger here though he  does make life. Does not seem he see me trying to set up my attack on Wc10 group. Let's see.

LoP: yes L16 is good for black the exchange K17 for L16 seems to favour black but it's hard to find a better defensive move for white instead of K17. Also white's follow up at L18 is actually pretty nice so i guess white is ok]
;W[kb]C[Marc: still defending, getting some eyespace];B[lb]
C[Rex A. Santoro: I believe I need to do this.

Lop: yup];W[la]C[Marc: hopefully this will end in sente for me]
;B[mb];W[rc]C[Marc: I think I can leave my top group for a while.
Should I strengthen C10 now?
I rather chose S17 that reduces your corner and builds up on R14 in case you would decide to invade the right side.

LoP: S17 is definitly big but i think E10 is the weaker group]

(;B[og]C[Rex A. Santoro: Necessary

LoP: why? i think it's not a very good idea to push white from behind on the 4th line.
You can attack E10 (i.e. with G10 cap) or you can invade the bottom or the right side. 
Actually i think this is a big mistake and you missed a chance to take the initiative here]
;W[ph]C[Marc: what do you want to do : build a wall probably.
But there is still a hole remaining with the J15 stone. And taking 4th line territory is always pleasant. If you push furhter with your wall, i will also start to worry for my C10 group.]
;B[qm]C[Rex A. Santoro: I believe now is the time to invade. I will pray tonight. : )

[LoP: wrong timing if you are going to invade it's not a very good idea to make white stronger with Q12 first. now you don't have so much room on the right side]

(;W[qo]C[Marc: Well, an invasion: that's the right move for you to play now. You cannot just let me build that huge moyo.
I suppose I should hinder you as much as I can, so a pincer jumps to mind, but which one? I really can't tell. If I pincer from above, you will slip to R4 or S4, so though it looks cramped, I chose to block the corner.

LoP: this make the corner territory secure but is pretty easy on black]
;B[qj]C[Rex A. Santoro: One side or the other. Hmmm, now about the bottom.]
;W[ri]C[Marc: To keep my base and squeeze you a little.
Don't know if this move is correct.]
(;B[rj]C[Rex A. Santoro: Create a base.];W[qi]C[Marc: I think if I didn't answer, it would have been easyer for you to live locally or go out.]
;B[pj]C[Rex A. Santoro: No, no dragon for you.

LoP: Important move];W[jf]C[Marc: Well Rex, you play a logical move here.
I was first tempted to answer automatically at P12 to make the connection of Q10 and P13 more difficult.
Then my "weak" C10 group came out of the back of my head once again, begging for help.
Then I wanted to play J4 to increase my potential territory.
Eventually, I decided to go further into the center, hoping you would answer for fear of my playing M14, so that I could play one of the others after.
On second sight, this move looks smallish, but it's more feeling than thinking...
So please Rex, be kind, make this move sente ;o)

LoP: this kind of move is maybe not so bad. It depends on the status of your white group on the top. If you think it doesn't have 2 eyes yet then this move is very good! But if the white group is already alive without it then it's just an unnecessary move wasted on a save group. so what do you think? is it good or bad, the decision is up to you.]
;B[kf]C[Rex A. Santoro: After this I'll try to attack W's left side group.

LoP: to small i guess you lose the chance to hit white where it hurts (at H3)]
;W[ip]C[Marc: You grab territory at the top, I will do the same at the bottom.

LoP white is still pretty open on the bottom (L4)];B[di]C[Rex A. Santoro: ATTACK!!

LoP: fine move];W[ci]C[Marc: Aha, here it is: the long expected and much feared attack.
I think the best for me is to try to make life below, so that you don't get too big a corner.]

(;B[dh]C[Rex A. Santoro: If Wc12, then Bd10 and I cut; if Wd10, Bc12.

LoP: not the usual way to handle this situation (because C12 is not so dangerous)]
;W[dj]C[Marc: I once heard the proverb "first run out, then live" ... or was it the other way around?

[LoP: yes try to run out first then live, the timing is difficult though ;) \]]
;B[ch];W[bh]C[Marc: if I can run out AND make some eyes, i'm happy :)
I don't know for you, but i cannot manage to reckon who is currently leading.
Maybe it means that the game is close ... or that i'm blind.

[LoP: I prefer white];B[bf]C[Rex A. Santoro: Try to take away some eye space.]
;W[bk]C[Marc: good "angle" move.
I will first threaten to make eyes by going on the other side. I should be able to make 1 on the side, and another by going out (hopefully).]
;B[bl];W[fk];B[kq]C[Rex A. Santoro: Time to invade.];W[jq]C[Marc: you are in a really violent mood these days ;)
Good invasion. You must have thought I had too much territory prospects.
I was thinking of a capping mood, but I think you could live under, and you have no weak group on which I could use an external wall.

[LoP: good analysis\]];B[kp]C[Rex A. Santoro: Didn't expect this move, but let's see.]

(;W[nm]C[Marc: don't really know what I want to do with that move. Was just looking for a lovely place to drop a stone.
Maybe i could say (not very convincingly) it's in the way to your Q10 group. If you forget to answer, I will cap your stones.
Could be my most useless move since the beginning :)]
(;B[ol]C[Rex A. Santoro: Don't know if this is right, but my defensive nature compels me to make it.

LoP strange move. you definitly follow your opponent too much. you should try to dictiate the game more, make your opponent follow your plans and try to find ways to counter your opponents plans.]

(;W[jm]C[Marc: my poker face move O7 did bother you, I see ...
so as promised ... though I don't really believe it can work.

[LoP: K7 is a bit thin\]];B[kn]C[Rex A. Santoro: I will try to escape or live. Looks risky, but I have a chance as I loose if I let them die.]
;W[km]C[Marc: let's see where it will bring us.
You must believe I devised a devilish plan ha ha];B[ln]
(;W[lm]C[Marc: so that's the big fight now, with you trying to create cutting points and me trying to build solid chains.
I wonder if we are supposed to read-out the whole thing ... which is not my case.]
;B[io];W[ho]C[Marc: ok, it will be very difficult to stop you. I never seem able to attack from the right distance or direction.
At least, i hope to extend my territory as much as possible while chasing you, but i have not a lot of prospects.]
;B[in];W[rn]C[Marc: difficult to find a good move. I think of several : P12, B13, L13, R18, C3.
Which one is the biggest?
If i could keep sente, that would be nice (they would look like good moves).

LoP: I like C3. L13 is also very good.
S6 is small];B[jp];W[iq]C[Marc: Your invasion group is getting stronger (I think you did invade with the right timing).
I don't like the look of it. My C10 group could suffer.];B[mp]
;W[qb]C[Marc: I don't see how to attack your group efficiently for the time being.
"Make territory while attacking", as the saying goes, but I don't see how :o(
So I hope to be able to play several big points that I see. Because otherwise, I will be behind in territory.
The problem is they are not *really* sente.

LoP: L13 is sente, C3 is most likely sente];B[hn];W[ik]C[Marc: nice move. At the same time defensive and offensive. Now you seem ready to split my F9 and K7 groups. So I feel compelled to help them a little.]
;B[cq]C[LoP: good move];W[cr]C[Marc: that's good too. You take at least as many points here as i took with R18. So i'm not better off than before.
I hope at least I didn't mess up with my responding C2.
I've got the bad feeling that you are the one controlling the game now, but I could not tenuki :(]
;B[br]C[Rex A. Santoro: Hopefully, he'll play Wd2 and I'll have sente.]
;W[bg]C[Marc: large move for sure, but i'm trying to get out of the Gote blues

LoP i think d2 is a bigger move];B[df]C[Rex A. Santoro: I wanted to connect both Bd12 and Bc16 groups. I *think* this does it.

LoP: this move seems odd, i'd like to play e3];W[dd]C[Marc: pressing once where it hurts? ;)]
;B[dc]C[Rex A. Santoro: Hmmmm, unexpected.];W[ed];B[ce]C[Rex A. Santoro: Still trying to keep my 2 groups connected. I think I've done this. Hopefully I'll be able to attack the Wh17 group.]
;W[kg]C[Marc: your response is solid. My previous move was maybe not a good idea. At least, I have sente, provided my north group is safe, which I hope (but would not bet a lot on that though).
My move here is to help a little bit the north group, to limit yours, an maybe help me take a few points in the centre.

LoP: L13 is very good];B[lf]
(;W[lg]
(;B[mg]C[Rex A. Santoro: I can bend at the head of stronger stones here.]
;W[mh]C[Marc: same (rather vague) idea]
(;B[nj]C[Rex A. Santoro: I need to be careful of the r10 group & try to reduce his center territory.

LoP: kinda strange move];W[mj]C[Marc: I see no way to kill your stones, so I will try to grab a few points in the centre.]
;B[nh]C[Rex A. Santoro: I think I'm connected now.];W[li];B[ni]
C[Rex A. Santoro: I believe this is safest. I want to play Bj13, but am afraid of Br10 group being cut off.

LoP: i think e3 is bigger];W[ob]C[Marc: i hope this can be sente, then I will take some points in the centre with j12
(or should i just play e3?)

LoP: D2 is the move for you on the bottom, p18 is pretty big but seems like wrong shape (Q18 instead)]

(;B[nc]C[Rex A. Santoro: Damn!]
(;W[ih]C[Marc: did i say j12?];B[hp]C[Rex A. Santoro: Now I'm seriously behind. If I don't do something strong, I will loose. Hopefully, this will help me.]
;W[hq]C[Marc: i should better go undeneath, because of the weakness at d2]
;B[go];W[er]C[LoP: good];B[gp]C[Rex A. Santoro: I need to capture some stones to win, W+17. Either this group or the lower right group.

LoP: both groups are save];W[gq];B[ep];W[al]C[Marc: i think i'm not forced to answer your move, as my group is not in immediate death risk.

LoP: good thinking];B[am];W[ak];B[bm]C[Rex A. Santoro: I'm loosing. WAAAAHHHHHH!!! I want my mommy!]
;W[fl]C[Marc: trying to reduce];B[fq];W[fr]C[Marc: no comment :)]
;B[eq]
(;W[ds]C[Marc: eyespace];B[or]C[Rex A. Santoro: Drastic measures are called for.

LoP: interesting];W[oq]C[Marc: very interesting move. Blocking in O2 doesn't work. But if you manage to live in this smallish corner, you are very strong.]
;B[pr];W[qq]C[Marc: i think it works after all!
a very nice move];B[mr]C[Rex A. Santoro: Man, what luck. Bp2 turned out to be a 16 point move. Whew! I'm still behind by 10 points though.]
;W[qr];B[mk];W[lk];B[jr]C[Rex A. Santoro: I doubt it, but will he die? The best is I reduce this and get out of it in sente.]
;W[ir]C[Marc: ... sigh ...];B[kr];W[gs];B[ml];W[fm]C[Marc: i hope your move is not sente]
;B[gh]C[Rex A. Santoro: Hmmm, I thought my original move of Wg11 would be to easy for Marc to cause me trouble here, so I played more solidly.]
;W[hi]C[Marc: keeping a few points in the centre.
It seems i'm not trying anything anymore. But are there still things to try?]
;B[gi];W[gj];B[ll]
(;W[kl]C[Marc: you are still keeping the sente!
I've got the feeling that in this game, you played more sente moves than me. How comes? Did you make better shapes from the start, or did I answer too much?]
;B[hl];W[hk];B[il]C[Rex A. Santoro: Simple reducing moves.]
;W[bs]C[Marc: bored of answering ;-)];B[ar];W[fn];B[fo];W[dm]
C[Marc: hope to end this with the sente];B[cn];W[pe]C[Marc: were you a bit shy on this one?]
;B[oe];W[oc];B[od];W[nr];B[ns]C[Rex A. Santoro: Marc, you're making some good reducing moves. You're pulling ahead more and more.]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[sm];B[ql];W[eb]C[Marc: i don't see interesting sente moves

LoP: E18 is big!];B[gc]C[Rex A. Santoro: Slowly he's gaining and gaining.]
;W[gb];B[ea];W[fa];B[da];W[fi];B[rk];W[sl];B[sk];W[sn]C[Marc: nice weather for this time of the year ...

;W[on];B[kk]C[Rex A. Santoro: How lucky am I now?];W[jk]C[Marc: ah, I KNEW I had to be careful here since I did count the liberties a few moves ago ... but I just forgot.
I'm banging my head on my PC right now. (probably won't get any of them to work better)]
;B[lj];W[kj];B[lk];W[jl]C[Marc: you will make some damage inside, but losing those stones would be worse :(]
;B[ki];W[jj];B[kh];W[jh]C[Marc: it hurts =(];B[mi];W[mq]C[Marc: i think the game must be quite close.

LoP: t11 is bigger];W[cf];B[be];W[nk]C[Marc: you are probably leading by a few points.
Once again ,the difficult thing is to find real sente moves (reducing your territory 1 point at a time)]
;B[ok];W[pn];B[np];W[op];B[no];W[oo];B[mn];W[qs];B[os]C[Rex A. Santoro: I believe, if I'm careful, that I've won by about 8 points. Whew!]
;W[pm]C[Marc: Like many bad players, I don't like the endgame very much. First of all, I'm bad at counting : It seems to me black has a small lead, but I cannot tell how much. Then, I cannot very well chose the order of moves, except for the double sente moves. And I nearly never dare to tenuki.]

;W[rd];B[si]C[LoP: Finally]
(;W[sh]C[Marc: still behind, and still answering your moves like a nice little lamb.
But what else can I do at this stage? Nothing I guess. The game is finished already.]

(;B[sj]C[LoP: You should cut and play the ko!, you have nothing to lose here]

;B[pi];W[ke];B[le];W[he];B[ge];W[js];B[ks];W[is];B[qh]C[Rex A. Santoro: I think you missed this, Marc. I get 1 point for this & sente. Sorry ... but just a little. :)

LoP: wrong thinking. you gain nothing here and the throw in is just wasting time since black P12 is sente even without the throw in. and the result is the same 1 point for black]
;W[rh]C[Marc: thought you would play p12 directly ?

LoP: yes that would be normal];B[oh];W[qg];B[ag];W[ah];B[af]
;W[gl];B[hf];W[if];B[ei];W[dr]C[Marc: no use playing this smallish ko]
;B[eo];W[ka];B[eh]C[Rex A. Santoro: Thanks for the game, Marc. I didn't think I had a chance until move 173. Even after this, I had to be very careful or I could have lost in the endgame.]
