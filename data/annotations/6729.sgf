C[hi i am fatih,
thanks for commenting my game.
i think my general problem in my games is that i feel like my opponent has more area than i have, and i desperately try to invade. however, most of them turns out to be an overplay. it didn't happen in this game.

what is your advice?

crazyd - Hi - let's see what happens.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[fq];W[hp];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[gq];B[dq];W[fr];B[ep];W[cp]
;B[fm];W[dl];B[jq]C[i don't know if my left group is safe enough to leave like that but i felt like i should attack the 3 white in the middle.

crazyd - seems okay, the D2 group should survive.  Perhaps a higher move like K4 would be both more forceful for attack and more consistent with the idea of growing a moyo based on your 4-4 corners.]
;W[lq];B[hr];W[jo];B[hq]C[crazyd - L4 is a narrow door.  You might want to play there before the door is shut by your opponent.]
;W[gp];B[gr];W[jp];B[kp];W[kq];B[lo];W[iq];B[jr];W[ir];B[is]
;W[ip];B[er];W[kr];B[nq];W[jd];B[mp]C[which is more important?
- playing free spaces
- connect n4. it looks like a fine wall to me

crazyd - I don't think it is a fine wall for two reasons.  1) it does not enclose anything (the L2 stones are connected out to K5), and 2) it is white's turn and he can play around R10 and live easily in front of your wall.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[de];B[lc]C[crazyd - O16 looks better for you.  If he responds, then you have two facing walls and it is your turn to play in the middle.  If he doesn't respond, then your move is a good follow-up.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[qk];B[qi]C[i am trying to push white to my strong(?) wall

crazyd - I think this is the right direction.];W[pn];B[qn];W[qm]
;B[po]C[crazyd - R5 seems much better to me.  This gives your opponent a useful cut.]
;W[rn]C[is sacrificing r6 good here?

crazyd - see previous comment.];B[on];W[qo];B[pm]C[while playing i realized that playing p7 was much better than q7.
your idea?

crazyd - They say to play corner moves before side moves and side moves before center, so R3 or R4 are better for points.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[pl];W[ci]C[at this point i lose my calm, and try to invade the big white areas.
when should i have moved on the left and upper side?

crazyd - I agree white seems better, but not because you haven't invaded yet.  As for white, there are weaknesses around C13-C14 and the area between D16 and K16.   When combined with invasion probes like C17 or D18 you should have an easy time reducing white's area.]
;B[le];W[ng];B[hc];W[jc];B[fc]C[crazyd - How about leaning attack at M13, threatening the three white stones to the right.  If he defends, then try J15.  His move 66 starts the same idea against you.  Are you keeping in mind that he can still invade at R17?]
;W[jf];B[nb];W[od];B[pc];W[kb];B[nf];W[of];B[mf];W[pg];B[pe]
;W[oe];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[he]C[i think, those stones cannot live against a strong player but i try. is it bad?

crazyd - I liked the way you played in the upper right corner.  For these two stones, see what you think about my variation on your next move.]

;B[fs]C[crazyd - good ko threat.];W[js];B[ff];W[mb];B[mc];W[ef]
;B[im]C[isn't this a big ko threat? he doesn't answer

crazyd - it's only a big ko threat if it kills the K4 group, right?  White has N2 and the center as miai, so I would not be confident I could kill it.]
;W[ff];B[mr];W[ko];B[lp];W[km]C[crazyd - K7 is better, and his nobi next move was very bad.]

;B[gm];W[fp];B[gk];W[eo];B[eq];W[dh]C[i think l8 and p14 stones are weak and i can capture them.
your idea?

crazyd - I think you are right, but you take the small group and let the big one escape.  Why not take the big group with a move like Q11 instead of your move at L9?]

C[THANKS...

crazyd - The worst problem I see is that you make moves that even you know shouldn't work, and against someone the same rank as you.  To improve you have to eliminate your mistakes, not hope your opponent will make more mistakes than you.  If you have been stuck at 7k for a while, then changing that attitude is the easiest way for you to improve.  Good luck.]
