Hi, I am Sen (abt 2k KGS)
Hope I can make enough constructive comments for this game]

;W[ng];B[lg];W[lf]
(;B[ne]C[M: I was aiming to get a throw in at N14 but neglected my two stones he put in attari on his next move.

Always remember b4 you attack must make sure your groups are secured enough. if not they will be easily counter attacked.]
;W[lh];B[mi];W[kg];B[jh];W[li];B[mk];W[pg]C[no point connecting now. just leave it and jump more into the center]
(;B[pi];W[nk];B[lj];W[kj];B[ki];W[ji]C[M: After I got into the same situation again (see previous comment), I decided to give up on my N12 group and focus on building my moyo on the left.A bad move I now feel, I could have gotten better results in the lower part of the board if I had gotten my N12 group out of there and towards the center.]
;B[ii];W[kh];B[hh];W[lk];B[jj];W[mj];B[ki];W[ml]
(;B[jk]C[that is good thinking but... you lost quite a fair bit there
This move is too small also];W[pe];B[pd];W[nd]
(;B[nc]C[M: Up untill a couple of weeks ago I wouldn't have played this move but rather weakly connect at P16. I believe O17 to be a better move, correct?

Just connect it solidly...];W[md];B[od];W[qe];B[re];W[sn];B[rp]
;W[so];B[sp];W[sm]
(;B[cn]TR[dj]C[because of the tmarked stone it might be better to play at C7 instead.]

;W[fn]
(;B[em]C[this move is not necessary. should have jump in];W[jp]
C[M: This move hit me like a hammer in the face :( Now the power of his N8 stones with his strength in the lower left and right is very obvious to me. I think I scared out and didn't play there for a while.]
;B[fm];W[gn];B[hm];W[gm];B[gl];W[in]
(;B[km]C[M: A move that was too late for me, it's a rather large jump in this context and comes far too late.

Yes too far in...];W[ln];B[kn];W[ko]
(;B[sh]C[M: Here I was already thinking end game fase. The largest part of the territory is set out and now I'm looking to get the last large points.

sente 1st before yose];W[rj]
(;B[si];W[sj];B[rg];W[rh];B[rd];W[ri];B[sg];W[im];B[il];W[jl]
;B[jm];W[kl];B[kk];W[ll];B[lj];W[hn]C[M: It seemed strange that an 8k would take a small move like this before all the other bigger ones still out there, for example the top area around N17. Since I gained about 4 stones in one month I don't really know what to expect from an 8kyu.]

;B[bg];W[ae]
(;B[mb]C[M: I really wanted to connect my two groups

not much use at this stage... better to maintain the sente move and play some good yose]

C[M: At this point I wanted to try out something, this 'tryout' cost me about 2 points, so it didn't really make a difference at this point.

Yah not much you can do at this pt.
Hope my review is will be of some good.
Main thing is to improve your main game overview.
Once you have good knowledge of main overview of the game it will lead you to know where to play next.

Try to learn how to do territory count mentally
It will help u to decide to invade or to reduce the moyo
