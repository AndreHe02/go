C[Since my game was fairly simple, I don't really have many
questions regarding how something could have gone
better. Instead, if you don't mind, I'd like to know if and
how my fuseki plays didn't work well together and when
and where I should have played more aggressively.
Thanks a lot for reviewing this!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq]

;W[cp];B[em];W[eq]C[Do you know of a better way to play out the "joseki" from
here?

> Bob: White 18 on E3 is not a joseki.

F3, F7 or F6 are moves that pro play here. Each of these moves prevent black to play on F6 what is key point here seems to me.

So, as your oponent missed to play in that way you could continue with more agressive Black 19 on F4.]

(;B[fj]C[> Bob: Was this to slow?
I'd say it is.
Maybe you could play 29 on K16 or F17?

What is idea of 29 on F10?
Securing some points?
It is not necessary to play this now as you are not in some danger here. 

White 24 on F12 is good move, but  you don't need to answer on it with E10 or F10.

Yes, White can cut on B what means you can sacrifice two stones, or resist making small group at left side live.]

(;W[nc];B[qg];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb]C[> Bob: White made mistake.
This is good, but yose move.]
(;B[lc]LB[jc:A]C[I felt A would have been better.

> Bob: Here you felt that something has to be done as White made mistake with slow (good for yose) move 34 on R18.

Too direct 35 on M17 let your opponent  to correct  his mistake. 

As you suggest  35 on A (K17) is much better.

Than Black has two options : M17 or H17, following with Black F17 or M17 respectively.]

(;B[md]C[> Bob: No, bad move, making White strong and escape. Better simple jump M15, besides all is now much more difficult for you.
But don't forget you still can invade upper left corner.
So, again too direct from your side.];W[nd];B[jd]LB[md:A][le:B]
C[Is expanding like this better than simply running with B
instead of A? I thought this was better, but riskier.

> Bob: I am probabbly not much stronger player than you, but this is something what looks me very bad. 
Letting White to connect underneath is wrong here. Also, playing contact move 45 on L17 make White strong on upper left area. So, why don't you left all here for future.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[kc];B[kd];W[lb];B[mb];W[mc];B[ld]C[I feel the reason I lost was due to the few mistakes I made
herethat easily cost me 20 points and sente. Do you think
otherwise?

> Bob:  Agree with you.
Here game was over for Black.

But at the end ??];W[kb];B[ie];W[hd];B[lg];W[he];B[if];W[hf]
;B[ig];W[hg];B[db]LB[cc:A]C[Perhaps A would be better. Less territory (I think), but
it seems much safer (orrather, I wouldn't kill myself here :) .

> Bob: Yes, I can understand what you mean with this. When you don't know some joseki it is difficult to play it from your head instantly. Then you sometimes improvise. And it is good strategy. Don't forget that go has milions of variations. 

But, let's return to this move 63 on D18. 
I am not sure this is bad. In fact, it seems to me you made best move here. Living here is impossible or some pro is able to find solution.

Until that, as you wrote, it was better for you to play with 3-3 invasion. Off course, I think you know this, so no comment on it.]

3-3 invasion was much better then this result.

You can find that 2-4 aproach is possible when side is free or yours, but I am not sure this is the case.

20 or so moves and achieve a better result?

Not so important for the game.
Also for your skill. I see you are good player during these moves, so don't try to find some big moves here for now.

Must be yoking. When you try to improve your skill it is important not to make such kind of mistakes in any circumstances. Sometimes it is only one move that you need to perform and game is on your side.
Like this one, too.
You noticed that, as result was on your opponent side. 
Only 1.5 point, "small" was about 5.
It is good to know that weak players sometimes loose only in middle stage or at the end of the game by this kind of "small" mistakes.]

Also, did I make any big mistakes in yose? I know I made
a couple "small" mistakes (i.e. "X"), but those were
primarily due to time. I'm wondering about bigger endgame
points.
Thanks so much for commenting this!

Avoid "small" next time.

Good luck.])

I think it is not necessary to present some possible continuations from here. Obviously black can secure lower side while attacking lower left corner. Other possibility is to restrain White with move on  key point F6. 
All is result of extension on E4 what puts White in trouble as cut on D5 can make situation very complicated for him.]
