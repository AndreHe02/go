:) I hope this commantary can be of some help. It was an interesting game! Black played a weak Fuseki, but White didn't understand the resulting position too well and let Black back into the game. I think the comment after move 18 is the key to understand the position, so please think a little bit about the things said there :)

Good luck with your next games :)];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[od];W[po]
;B[pl];W[mp]LB[oo:C][qo:A][pp:B]C[BA now is bad, Black should play CB oder BC.]
;B[qo];W[qn]C[would r4 be better here?

---

WR6 is fine :)];B[qp];W[pn];B[mr]TR[pl]C[This is very good result vor White! The triangled stone is too close to White's strong group, and the squared stone is too low.]
;W[pi];B[rl]LB[pf:A][rn:B]C[Instead of WA now, I would prefer WB immediately.]
;W[pf];B[rf]C[A dad move, too low.];W[rn];B[ri]LB[nf:1][ni:2]
[ok:3][nl:A]TR[rf]SQ[pf][pi]C[this result doesn't look very good to me, because q14 and q11 have gotten very weak and the lower group isn't settled either.

-----

Again, the black move is too low! BA would have been much better.

Your thinking is wrong here. The squared stones are NOT weak, but light. That's because Black answered them with the triangeld stones, which are not good moves on their own, and, additionaly, make in uninteresting for Black to capture the squared stones. Imagine Black plays B1, B2, B3 later to capture the white stones; then he would have played two stones to much to reach this goal (the triangled stones!)

The white group in the lower right is unsettled, but quite strong :)]
;W[dj];B[fc]LB[hc:A][ml:B]C[Instead WA, for some reason I like WB :)]

;W[cf]LB[lc:A][cn:B]TR[bc][bd][be]C[I thought this went quite well for me, and with the b15 exchange he made my moyo even safer. (a c10 attachment becomes less likely, and I really hate it when that move happens to me)

------------

Yes, Black played the marked exchange too early.

Now Black played BA, but BB looks better?!];B[lc]LB[mf:A][ml:B]
[fp:C]C[With WA White goes wrong now. Remember: Those stones are light :) So, BB and BC are better.]
;W[mf];B[jd]LB[ie:B][fp:A]C[WA is big now, but WB looks interesting, too.]
;W[fp]C[WA];B[bp];W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[er]
;B[br];W[cn]LB[cm:A]C[Why not at A?];B[mq];W[lp]C[How about not answering and playing at the top?!]
;B[jq];W[jf];B[ie];W[if];B[he];W[hf];B[gd];W[fd]C[this was no small sacrifice, but I thought it would be better to defend the moyo and I saw no way to safe both.

------------

Of course the moyo has top priority. But I think Black is ok now...]
;B[kd];W[gj]LB[ml:A][jo:B]C[I still prefer WA :) WB looks also good. The marked stone is too near to White's walls.]
;B[jo];W[lm];B[jm];W[lk];B[qi];W[ph]C[Why do you answer there? The center looks more promising.]
;B[pj];W[oj];B[ok];W[nj];B[om];W[nn];B[gn];W[fm];B[jk]TR[gn]
C[Very effective moves!];W[pc]C[is an invasion here possible? how should I continue?

----

Hm, hard to say. There is some aji, but...];B[pd];W[qb];B[ob]
;W[rg];B[qg]C[Black wants to save all and fails. It's better to take the corner, White connects, Black defends at the right.]
;W[qf];B[rh];W[re];B[sg];W[rd];B[qe]LB[rc:A]C[BA instead leads to a ko.]
;W[rc];B[pg];W[oc];B[nc];W[of];B[og];W[nf];B[pb];W[qc];B[md]
;W[sb]LB[se:A]C[Not at A?

Of course, White is ahead now.];B[ij];W[gm]C[maybe I should have played something like m12(n12 to link up my groups? But I saw no point which would really link up everything.]
;B[nh];W[mi]C[You should continue here only if you saw a way to connect. If there is no one, it's better to make eyes for the lower group at once.]
