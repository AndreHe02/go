maybe I should have picked a fight..when did white gain the lead?

Paw: I think overall it would have been important to take initiative against  the lower moyo as soon as you opponent played a move that didn't require you to respond immediately. When your opponent has the initiative, one is tempted to keep answering his moves. Always ask yourself if you really have to answer, or it would be preferrable to take the initative somewhere more important on the board.]
