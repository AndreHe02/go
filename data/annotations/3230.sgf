C[I played this game on KGS as highflyer against Lok. I had black and lost the game. Would you be so kind and review the game to find out my mistakes, please? Any Idea which topic of Go I should especially train would be helpful. Thanks.

hi Lok,

I'll do my best to find your weaknesses and give alternative variations whenever usefull...

(;B[po]C[I think I should have pincered.

yes, a pincer at Q8 would work perfect with Q16 and K4...];W[pn]
;B[oo];W[qp];B[qq];W[ql];B[ce]C[you can also consider playing C14, because a pincer here is perfect for white in combination with D5...]
;W[cg];B[ee];W[fd]
(;B[bc]C[B17 is terrible shape... you should continue at D12 to build influence... if you really feel like playing in the corner you can try the trick move at C17, but I don't recommend it...

(;B[gd]C[I'm unsure about this type of move. Maybe it's too small? My idea was to make thikness on the upper side towards the right side.

--

very small... white cannot escape anyway... the black position is promising, you should use your cornerstone Q16... see variation...]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[now, your G16 stone is _really_ useless... white went easy on you and jumped in the corner... if he attached at M16 instead, you would end up even more overconcentrated...

(;B[qe]C[Maybe Q15 were better? This seems to be a mistake.

this is a terrible mistake, the joseki move is at Q15... White exploited your mistake in the best possible way... see variation for the joseki...]
;W[qb]C[here you can avoid the worst and connect at Q15, but white will connect out and leave you with a very bad result...]
;B[pb];W[pe]C[nowa you lose one side, R15 or Q17... your choice...]
;B[qf]C[I think, P15 were better.

yes, I think so to];W[od];B[nb];W[ob];B[oe]C[Now I realised my mistake and decided to solidify my territory on the upper side and to make R14/R15 living. See next moves.]
;W[pf];B[mc];W[pa];B[pg];W[of];B[og];W[oc];B[nf]C[I decided to make some thickness as compensation for the lost corner territory.

--

white would have taken corner territory anyway after jumping to 3-3, and you would have got thickness... after your variation, white gets more territory and Black only a bunch of worthless stones... I wouldn't call Q13 thickness... these stones might even get under attack later... after such a mistake it's usually the best to resign the game...]

hard to tell, but I would prefer Q2... if you can use the strength of N7, it can be a good move... otherwise stick with the corner territory...]
;W[qr];B[nl];W[pk]
(;B[oj]C[Maybe Q10 were better?

--

I would have played somewhere else... is Q9 really that sente? now would be a great moment to extend your framework at a point like E7...

;W[fn]C[now white got the big point... very important move...]
;B[ck]C[I don't know how to handle such big opponent moyos like this one. With my next moves, I "tryed to do something". Do you have an idea, how to learn to handle such situations?

--

you went in far too deep, you should never be allowed to live in there... a light reduction is the best option you have... maybe a move at E9... but you cannot expect to reduce much after F6 is played...

I have 2 advices for you, if you have problems with big moyos:

1) read "reducing territorial framework", it's a really great book...

2) don't let your opponent build such huge moyos in the first place...]
