;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq]C[H: This is my favorite fuseki as B currently.]
;W[nc]C[H: This is a move I don't like much.  I'm not familiar enough with the idea of approaching outside.  I want to avoid kobayashi shape if I play q14 or r14, so I will approach d15 (this is the same strategy I will use as W to avoid that opening)

CG: Until recently, R10 was considered "the only move" for white. You can answer the approach move at Q14/R14, but Q10 or D15 also look good. You should not be afraid of a white Kobayashi shape: You are black, so you should be one move ahead when both of you just build up their favorite shapes.]
;B[de];W[qf];B[oe];W[qc]
(;B[fd]C[H: I think this was better than focusing locally.  This will let me build some thickness that I can hope to coordinate with my shimari.

CG: This pressing move is not necessarily sente, so I would prefer playing R16. If white plays R16, the value of your shimari is reduced - an extension on the right side would no longer be a double-purpose move.]
;W[ce]
(;B[cf]C[CG: If you like to fight, you can consider C16.];W[cd]
;B[df];W[fb]C[CG: I think white C7 would be better - an approach move at C6 hurts more than another sente move in the top left.]
;B[gc]C[CG: This is too slow - C6 and R16 are more urgent.]
;W[qd]C[CG: Good!];B[md]C[H: I felt a move was needed locally, now that it's 4 against 2.  This and o14 were my considerations.  This felt the best, in terms of the flow of the game.

CG: Well, if white now plays C7, you will have a hard time getting your thickness working. If you consider R16 sente, you should have played there yourself as it's also sente for you. 
I would still rather play C6 and handle the stones lightly.]
;W[mc];B[ld];W[kc];B[qj]C[CG: Now imagine you had exchanged black R16 for white Q17 ...
Just trying to make territory with the shimari is quite slow. White can still play S4 or Q9.]
;W[qh]C[CG: Ouch! This move is very bad - too small, too slow, and it helps black to make a good move (P10).]
;B[oj]C[CG: Good!];W[ng];B[og];W[oh]
(;B[nf]C[CG: Allowing white to make a ponnuki hurts - I would rather play Q13.]

;W[nh];B[mj];W[jh];B[ji]C[H: I'm still not sure this was a good plan.  My desire was to make W heavy, but I failed totally because I neglected my own heavy group.

CG: This looks like an overplay - your own group is too weak to play like this. Honte would be L14.]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[jk]
(;B[ii]C[H: This, I feel, was my first large mistake of the game.  This makes for some hard fights that B is behind in.

CG: The game is already difficult for black. If you don't want to pull out K11, why did you cut?]
;W[jg];B[kf];W[hg]
(;B[je]C[CG: Too slow. You need another move in the center, so you should either push at L16 (yes, this is normally a bad move ...) or play G11 (which may lead to an exchange - see variation).]
