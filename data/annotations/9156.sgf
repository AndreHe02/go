C[Hello, dear Reviewer!

I played here as HonFu. It is a moyo game, although normally I prefer games with territories. During the course of the game I felt like my potential gradually melted away and White just grew and grew.

Please show me, where I went wrong!

[kb\]: Hi HonFu.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf]
;W[jd];B[jp];W[hq];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[bf]
;W[eg];B[ho]C[Hon: I never liked this move much since I don't know how to make the most of it. It seems so vague and sometimes even thin.

Since this is an influence game I felt like it might be the right thing to do anyway.

[kb\]: This looks like a great move to me.  Without the joseki at top left, this pattern has been played before in a professional game Lee Jong-Moon vs He Xiaoren.]
;W[po]C[[kb\]: White has ignored your move at H5.  Playing to capture H3 is very, very big - not only territorially, but it limits the effect of an additional moyo-building move at the top from White.  You should adjust your play in this corner accordingly.]

(;B[nq]C[[kb\]: This is exactly how not to do it - this puts no pressure on White's stone.  Perhaps the standard way to play here in the Chinese opening will work fine?]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[qm];B[rl];W[no]C[[kb\]: This stone is much better placed than in the variation where Black plays a knight's move response instead of a one-point jump.  Now Black taking the stone is smaller, as White can invade with less consequence.]

(;B[iq]LB[fp:A][gq:B]C[Hon: After this move I condemned my choice, because I felt like you would only play this kind of move after White has already played around A. Was B a better choice?

[kb\]: This move is poor because White never answered your original capping play.  Why not just take the stone?]
;W[hp];B[io];W[ko];B[kp];W[lo];B[mp];W[mo]C[White makes decent shape and takes advantage of Black's poor play, though this stone should probably be at O7 or attach at Q9.]
;B[ok]C[Hon: I felt like this is urgent now so that White can not invade too easily. White will come in anyway later, so was this the wrong choice?

[kb\]: This is the correct direction and is almost sente.  If White doesn't respond, attack.]
;W[ir]C[[kb\]: Not sente.]
(;B[jr]C[[kb\]: How about attacking?  This move gives White a chance to play at the key point.]
;W[ip];B[jo];W[jq];B[kq];W[mk]C[[kb\]: ...and White takes the key point.

You have ended in gote three times without benefit, and now are behind.  That is the lesson here.]
;B[pc]C[[kb\]: You must play actively.  In a moyo game, territorial moves just don't cut it.]
;W[pj]TR[pc][kq][nq][jr]C[[kb\]: White turns his weak group into a source of strength.  This is because of Black's defensively-oriented marked plays.]
;B[pk];W[ph]
(;B[nh]C[Hon: I thought that I can (and probably have to) fight here, since White is also not yet completely settled below.

[kb\]: Perhaps a leaning play is better.];W[ni];B[oi];W[oh]
;B[oj]LB[mi:A]C[Hon: I often see that Black plays A before this move, but I thought that in this case it would only help White's defence.]
;W[ng];B[mh];W[of];B[mj];W[qf];B[qe];W[mg];B[lh]C[Hon: I got out into the center and splitted White but he seems to be safe on both sides anyway. It feels like my points have just been destroyed for nothing in return.

[kb\]: Yes, it is a problem.  See comments on move 46.];W[kk]
;B[lk];W[ll];B[lj];W[kl];B[cq]LB[cn:A]TR[lh][ho]C[Hon: Now I think A might have been wiser, since White's potential grew so big on the left side.

[kb\]: A is better, but how does White have potential?  Black is poking out and has a strong group in the center!  You need to stop thinking so defensively.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[bq]C[[kb\]: Good move by White.];B[br];W[bp]
;B[fq];W[fp];B[ep];W[eo];B[eq];W[go]C[Hon: Perfect connection for White - solid and blocks my way to the left.]
;B[ar];W[gr];B[fr];W[bh]
(;B[hc]LB[lc:A]TR[pc]C[Hon: Maybe this move needs explanation. I thought that I was in a bad position already because I have too many groups in the board with small territories and almost no growth potential. White's group in the right center might become a bit weak if I attack it correctly, but I did not see a good way. Coming in at A looks like it will just give White safety. And it also looks too small after I have played the marked stone.

So I came in here, merely hoping that while I get out, at some point a thin spot to the right might appear ... (it sounds paradox, I know) It did not happen. I did not even get out alive here.

[kb\]: You could try to be more effective with a leaning attack - same principle as my comments earlier when White attacked your right side.

This is the last point I discuss.];W[cb];B[bb];W[db];B[ba];W[ic]
;B[he];W[if];B[fe];W[hb];B[gg];W[gh];B[hg];W[hh];B[ig];W[ji]
C[Hon: Here I thought I'd have enough aji to survive even after a tenuki, but It seems that I have been wrong.]
;B[gn];W[jf]C[[kb\]: Ouch.

No further comments.];B[gb];W[gc];B[hd];W[fb];B[jg];W[kg];B[kh]
;W[jh];B[ib];W[ga];B[kf];W[lg];B[je];W[ke];B[kd];W[ie];B[jc]
;W[id]C[Hon: Here I see that I have hallucinated and there is no escape aji.]

;B[iq];W[bm];B[bn];W[bo];B[bl];W[an];B[dl];W[ei]C[Hon: I have reduced the left side, but the top was such a catastrophy, and I have such little territory everywhere that it's just over.

I'd be glad if you showed me how I could have played this moyo game better.

Thank you!
