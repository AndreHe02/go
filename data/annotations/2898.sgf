C[I'm not really sure what to ask for help on as I'm still fairly new to the game, only been playing for about a month.
So, anything you think would be helpful for me to hear please say...

*Also I'm trying to spread out more in my play, connecting and splitting territory more often, as opposed to playing linearly like many other beginners do, if you could give me any pointers on this I would love to hear them.

----

tsjanl:

Hi Muecci,

For someone who plays for a month, you played quite a good game.

In this review I try to focus on a few aspects of the game. I think that is a better way to learn than a thourough analysis (even if I could produce that). I will concentrate on the opening and the middle game, because I think there is the most ground to be made for you at this moment.

If you encounter a go-term you don't understand, you can look it up at Sensei's Library (http://senseis.xmp.net/).

I will end this review with some general remarks.

Let's go.];B[qd];W[dq];B[pq];W[dc];B[co];W[de]LB[jd:A][eo:B]
[cq:C]C[This really supprised me, I was expecting him to play E4 or try to save that corner. Was this a mistake on his part, and if so how could I have capitalized on it?

tsjanl:

I wouldn't call it a mistake. If you end in gote in the lower left, he will possibly compensate the loss there with a gain in the top left, because he will have three stones there and you none.

You have to make a choice here: react to white's move on top (A would be a good reply), or to play in the lower left (around B or C). What you choose is on our level mostly a matter of taste.

See variations.]
(;B[eo]LB[fp:A]C[tsjanl:

I think I would play at A, because it's limits the possibilities of white's stone more, but my joseki/fuseki knowledge is not good enough to be certain of it.]
;W[fp]
(;B[gq]C[tsjanl: This move I don't like. It seems that you are jealous of the territory white is getting at the bottom. You are asking white to react, and as a result, white will even get stronger there.

A better strategy is to get compensation elsewhere in return. See variation.]
;W[gp]
(;B[iq]TR[gq]SQ[co][eo]C[tsjanl:

And this is certainly bad.

The triangled stone is not important. It doesn't threathen white much (because white can always get into the corner or walk out), and doesn't promise you a lot. Trying to save that stone doesn't give you a lot.

The squared stones on the other hand are important. They can make territory in the corner or extend to D10, which are both big. Playing from these stones promise to give you the most.

See variation.];W[hp];B[ep]C[tsjanl:

This is called a 'thank you move'. You are forcing white to play a move he already wanted to play. In a way he is getting it for free.]
;W[eq];B[cq];W[dp]
(;B[cp]LB[ep:A][eq:B]C[See variation for a further illustration why the exchange A-B has been bad for you.]
;W[do];B[dn];W[hq];B[jp]LB[oc:D][jd:B][cj:A][pk:C]TR[eo][ep]
C[tsjanl:

When you have to decide in the opening which move to play, ask yourself these three questions:

- Do I have a weak group? If yes: defend it.
- Does my opponent have a weak group? If yes: pressure it.
- Otherwise: play a big move.

J3 is not important. Like G3 earlier it doesn't threathen white and doesn't promise you a lot of profit.

The marked stones are more important. But I do believe they are not important enough at this moment.

White doesn't have weak groups, so I think it's time for a big move. I have marked some for you.]
;W[jc]C[Would splitting 4 and 22 by playing G17 be a good response to this or would it have been, as I thought, too risky?

I'm not really good at effecting the flow of the stones yet so not quite sure how to attack that top corner.

----

tsjanl:

First: see how white is the first to take a big point.

G17 would be a very bad idea at this moment. It doesn't threathen white really: D17/15 are strong and K17 can extend to N or even O17.

On the other hand you are creating a weak group. White can attack that group. While you defend, white will get stronger.

See variation.]
(;B[oc]LB[cj:D][dj:C][pk:A][qk:B]C[tsjanl:

Good! I have marked some other ones.

I think I would have played A, but that's a matter of style.]
;W[qj]C[tsjanl:

White knows his lesson: if your oponent plays the corner enclosure, a play at the extension point is almost always big.]
;B[qh];W[qm];B[qo]LB[cj:B][dj:A]C[tsjanl:

I don't think this is needed at this moment. You can defend the corner against a white attack. A or B would be bigger.]
;W[cj]TR[jc][qj]C[tsjanl:

Again, white takes the chance. Do you see the difference between whites upper left and your upper right. Because you have allowed white to take all the three marked points his corner is a lot wider and yours seems a bit cramped.

The opening has been a success for white.];B[dg]C[tsjanl:

Good timing!

White is threathening to make a huge territory in the upper left. Now that opening is finished this seems to me the moment to invade.]
;W[gd]C[tsjanl:

This could very well be the move that wins you the game. White puts far too little pressure on your stone. He should chase you to the center, while sketching out territory at the same time for himelf.]
;B[kc]LB[lc:A]C[tsjanl:

This is bad for two reasons.

Firstly: you started an attack that became even forcefuller because of white's weak reply. Now it is the time to continue it. Otherwise, you would have played D13 for nothing. Note that white's C10 could become weak.

Secondly: it is bad to attach when you are attacking. You only ask white to react and get stronger. So if you want to play in this area, a move like A would be a lot better.]

(;W[ch]C[tsjanl:

White plays strange moves. When an important lone stone is attached, you should react. See variation.]

(;B[cg]C[tsjanl: Now that white didn't react, you also could consider playing at the top. See variation.]
;W[en]C[tsjanl: Again a poor decision by white. Although this move is big, defending the corner with a move like C15 is urgent. (Remember: urgent moves before big moves).]
;B[dm]
(;W[fo]C[tsjanl: Not needed, see variation.];B[cd]C[tsjanl: Good.]

(;W[dd]C[tsjanl: I do believe this is needed. But it is a very big loss to white. Especially when you consider he took two moves to capture two black stones.]
;B[ce];W[bl];B[bm];W[cl];B[dl];W[cm];B[bn]C[tsjanl: Why not connect. OK, white could capture B7, but this way you are loosing your important way into the center, because you have to defend at C6 anyway.]
;W[dk];B[cn];W[ek]C[tsjanl: White has secured his C10 group, and you have practically no way to get into the center anymore. A big loss.]
;B[al]LB[jd:B][mp:A]C[tsjanl: These moves are far too small at this moment. A looks urgent to me at this moment, while B still is very big.]
;W[bk];B[ak];W[aj];B[am];W[cc];B[bc];W[bb];B[ac];W[ab];B[bd]

;B[bg];W[ei];B[fe];W[fd];B[ef];W[jj];B[em]LB[jj:A][mp:B]C[tsjanl: Again, this is far too small. Now that white has played A, a move around B becomes even more urgent.]
;W[fm];B[gn];W[fn];B[in];W[hr];B[ir];W[mo]C[How would you have responded to whites attack at N5? I got scared and just played passive. Was this a good or bad decision?

tsjanl: 

You should have prevented this long ago. On the other hand, you are lucky, because white reduces on the fifth line, instead of invading on the fourth line. Because he has played K10, he could escape to two sides, and that woud be very difficult to stop.

And because he plays his stone high, just defending is the good move. It gives you more territory at the side than white can hope to get in the center.]
;B[mq];W[on]
(;B[ok]C[tsjanl: Again, this is a jealous move. What if white plays P11?  Your P9 stone will have a very difficult time and white can  walk into the upper right. See variation.]
;W[jd];B[if]C[tsjanl: L16 would be bigger.];W[kd];B[lc];W[ld]
;B[nc]LB[md:A]C[tsjanl: too timid. A is the move.];W[kf];B[ih]
LB[nf:A]C[tsjanl: there are more points for you waiting on the right. A play around would be bigger.]
;W[nf];B[me]C[tsjanl: an overplay. what if white plays N16?]
;W[mf];B[md];W[le];B[oe];W[of];B[pf];W[pi]C[tsjanl: Finally a move around here. 

Now the territories are sketched out. My comments after this will be more concise, because I think you can learn most at this moment in the opening and early middle game.]
;B[og];W[ie];B[he];W[hd];B[gf]C[tsjanl: you will see later that this is bad shape.]

Any comments on any aspects of my game would be greatly appreciated, and once again thank you for your time.

tsjanl:

Let's recapitulate.

After the opening your position was bad. The main reason was that you gave white the opportunity to get a lot of the big points.

But then played a good timed invasion. Weak play by white gave you a lot of opportunities.

Later in the middle game you failed too see where the most profit was to get for you: in the upper right. That made it a close game again.

In the end you made some costly endgame mistakes, that nearly cost you the game.

I would advise you the following things:

- Play through this game again and concentrate on two things:

-- In the opening, try to see which are the urgent moves (that you have to play at that very moment), and the big moves (that you have to play when you get the chance).
-- In the middle game: try to see where the biggest opportunities are for both players to create territory, and which moves would help with creating your own, or destroying the chances of the opponent.

- Try to concentrate in the next few games on the afore mentioned points and see if your game gets better by it.

- Also, try to change your state of mind while playing. Don't be jealous. Your opponent will get territory, just create more than he does.

- Next time you sent in a game to the GTL, sent a game you lost. You will learn more from it.

- If you have the impression you got a bit better in the opening and the middle game, sent in a game and ask for help with the endgame.

It was a pleasure to make this review. You played a good game for someone who plays for a month, and I think you will grow fast. And remember: the most important is to enjoy the game.
