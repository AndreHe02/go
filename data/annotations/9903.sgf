C[So, one point i don't really know, (you'll see after) is how my opponents did to destroy all my territory (i guess that was't territory at all).
I thought have build big territory but he walk in and kill some group was mine, i guess that was only influence so, if you can tell me how defend against invade or how prevent the invade. I'll tell you later the moment i think.

Hi,
there are some technical and some strategical aspects concerning blacks play. At some stages of the game I just wondered where things evolved; I expected different places to be important.

You may hate me for my comments sometimes, but I tell you what I think:

You have to think more about the pure value of your moves. What goal do you like to achieve? How many points is the move worth - an estimate is enough. Are there big points on the board and may I just play a useless atari/sente move which makes my opponent stronger?

Just because a move is sente, it doesn't mean it is good.

When you say by yourself that you are 'greedy' you appear like you recognized your problem. But beeing greedy is OK for a beginner (like I am). What you need is *true desire* to gain victory and stop beeing lazy - If you were really, really greedy and you would really, really like to win, there would be some moves you surely wouldn't play.

And sometimes it is not greed - you just refuse to defent and ignore obvious problems for quite some time ;)

Ignore my tone of voice and try to stick to the advice - I am sure it will help.

LB[co:A]C[mmm, maybe a strange shape

[reviewer\]:
I am probably to weak to judge. I would ask myself how I would respond to a move like white A. This formation is used to gain influence in the center. An invasion in the corner looks possible to me but this formation basically screams: "I am not interested in territory here."]

(;B[kq];W[no]
(;B[hq]LB[gp:B][hq:A]C[[reviewer\]:
I don't like this move. The relationship of A to B is bad shape for black (inverse shoulder hit). W-G3 or W-H4* should be expected and are a slap in the face for black.

It is also strange to use L3 as some sort of attack (pincer) and have to defend it on the next move. O5 should also be no surprise for you.

*unlikely from my point of view: because the D6 group is high white probably does not expect to get much in the center by now.]
;W[gq];B[hr];W[gr];B[po];W[lo]
(;B[cf]C[[reviewer\]:
This looks extremely odd to me. The important part of the board is L3 and N3, imho. The D6 group may get overconconcentrated, but is no easy target, *because it is high*. So there is no need to expand it by now.

I added some variations concerning the lower right. Imho you can either forget about L3 entirely and press from the right, or try to save the left and get some damage on the right. Or do a risky shape and cut the knichts move diagonally... I am unsure about that, but compared to the other variations it doesn't look so sad.]
;W[gc];B[bd];W[md]C[[reviewer\]:
Odd move. Probably white doesn't want black to have too much center influence. Your corner is still open and also very big if you secure it.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cb];W[db]
(;B[mf]TR[om][pm][qm]C[must i have here close like 12D before play here ?

[reviewer\]:
I think the move is a good idea. The problem is the area of white playing around P7. This would mess up the mojo plan, but there still can be gained reasonable... No real variation but a simple idea follow; maybe you also think about the miai idea I showed one move earlier.]

(;W[jp]C[[reviewer\]: No surprise W will come up with this at some point of the game. If you were surprised, read smth on senseis library about strong/weak groups in the middle game, please.]

Unnecessary and a big mistake. You are already connecteed, imho. See the variation below.]
;W[ol]
(;B[mp]C[[reviewer\]:

Second unnecesary play in this area - huge mistake again.

You really have to avoid such moves. The group on the left is save - because it is connected. You don't cut white like this, you just make him stronger. There are many other simple and bigger moves that you could have seen and played.]
;W[mo];B[ql]
(;W[ci]C[Here, how must i defend ? surrond him, or try to protect the two groups or other ?

[reviewer\]:
The top group is save. You don't need to protect it.

The lower group has no eyes/territory, but white can not *easily* attack it - because it is high. White has issues to come up with if you try to settle down left - I showed them in a variation, and I agree that the problem is territory for black, locally, but the real, earlier problem is/was, that black has no real clue how to use the high stones at D6. The weak group at K3 further complicated such plans and made a center mojo possible for white.

Maybe you have a look at eidogo.com and search for the pattern on the lower left (D6 and D4). The pros use this pattern quite differently.]

[reviewer\]:
No, the correct term is "sour grapes". The moves I suggested in the variation may be greedy, too. But this move just tries to destroy a bunker with soft cushions. Your corner is open and white is damn solid because of the very slow and very solid N16 stone.

The whole sequence left went extremely well - especially all the corner territory you gained. All you have to do now is secure some territory - maybe prevent too much white territory in the center - and the game is won.]

Purpose? Imho unnecessary. Still ignoring the center. And gote.]
;W[ji]C[[reviewer\]: White finally took the center - and is beeing greedy with it.]
;B[mj]C[[reviewer\]:
Now you recognize there is something in the center.

The rest of this game is technical details. I will search for questions from your side in the sgf, but the fact that you misunderstood the role of the center and the balance of territory at some points in this game (unnecessary moves) is the reason for your problems in this game.

The role of D6 is unclear for me from the beginning, but this may be due to my rank (I may be to weak to understand moves like D6).

But this is not important. The moves in the beginning should be clear to you, and I am sure D6 wasn't... because you gave white thickness in the south with the inverse shoulder hit - and a low pincer.]
;W[lk]
(;B[io]C[[reviewer\]:
As white, I would just stretch... probably because I would be angry.

I don't like this move at all. It looks lost from the beginning. The variation is just an idea of what might happen.]

;B[ij];W[jj];B[ii]C[This stone was too greedy too no ?
maybe i'm to greedy ^^'

[reviewer\]:
Just imagine you would not have made the one point K8 exchange. Maybe the four liberties would suffice? Yes, this may be a little greedy. But your problem is lack of reason. Why K8? Its a yose move. Why do we keep them for the end? 

-> Because liberties, aji and strategy are far more important in the middle game.]

In this case, one move earlier still would have been enough. But this gap is already open for quite some time.]

[reviewer\]: I think it is hard to tell what to do in such a situation. I prefer not getting in such situations for no reason.

[reviewer\]:
At some points (f.e. 201/202) the order of moves really shows that you are not paying attention / not taking your time with the moves. White simply sees some things you don't see and shows better understanding of whole board. The thing I found sad is that you were actually leading by quite a bit at some points during the game. If you identify those moves in the future, its probably like one kyu of strenth you will gain for each such move you don't waste.]
