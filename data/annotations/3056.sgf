C[*X*: Hi, thanks for reviewing.  I lost this game by a fairly siginificant margin, even though there was no komi.  I didn't see myself make any large tactical blunders, so the game must have been lost on strategic issues.  To be honest, I'm not really sure where I went wrong.  Could you help me out?  Thanks.

Hi, ok, I'll try my best.];B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce]C[*X*: Since there's no komi, I've decided to take a territorial approach and force white to be aggressive.

ok];W[kc]C[*X*: Isn't this too far from my shimari?  K17 is more usual, and I've heard that J17 is also playable... but this lets me play J17, which is a pretty good extension.
-----
No, L17 is ok. K17 is not so good, probably a bit too close from the shimari. I founded 3 pro games in my database (20332 games) with L17 and 0 for K17. A more usual approach is P16.]
;B[ic]C[wrong side ! You must attack the white stone from your weak stone to push white toward the shimari.
P17 or O17 is the standard move in this situation.];W[oc];B[qg]
C[*X*: Is this good, or too slow?  Obviously I don't want to play Q17, and I don't feel like N17 immediately will turn out well...
------
What is your plan here? It's not clear for me. If you wanted to attack the white stones, this move is too passive. Q15 should be better.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[pf];B[qf]C[*X*: Too submissive?  I felt like playing solidly.
------
It's ok (but you can also tenuki).
If you plan to attack this group, it's good to answer solidly.]
;W[dj];B[ie];W[jd]
(;B[qn]C[*X*: After playing solidly on the right, I felt like connecting at J16 would be too submissive... but maybe this shouldn't have been ignored.  Still, when he finally does push through in the endgame, it's just territory... it doesn't threaten my group.

Maybe approaching this hoshi on the other side (O3) is better, or F3?  Feels awfully low on the right side.
-----
If you answer the honte move J16, the white group become weak. If white play to reinforce it, you can still play this move (R6) or F3. 
The choice between thes two move is a strategic one: a strong pressure on the white group can help you to developp your right side towards the center. With R14, this move (R6) is more coherent.]
;W[on];B[nq];W[pm];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qm]C[white wanted too many things]
;B[pr];W[or];B[po];W[oq];B[oo];W[nr];B[qr];W[np];B[no];W[mq]
C[*X*: This is clearly not good for White.

yes, horrible...];B[qj]C[*X*: At this point, I felt I was winning...

Of course this is very bad for white:
overconcentred in the south part, weak in the other side (perfect for an attack)]

(;B[lk]C[see alternative move

keima (L8) is the typical move for an attack.];W[lm];B[lo]C[*X*: This is slack... keep pushing, maybe?

wrong direction];W[kp]C[So M5 was a thank you move];B[lp];W[lq]
;B[jo];W[km];B[jn];W[iq];B[il];W[nk];B[oj];W[nj];B[oi];W[ni]
;B[nh];W[li];B[jk]C[when you are attacking don't play gote move]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[mh];B[ng];W[jm];B[im];W[lf]
(;B[ne]C[see the alternative move];W[md];B[pd];W[od];B[oe]C[*X*: Was it too small to take this territory now?  It feels big, but 
really isn't only, what, 15 points?
-------
Yes, it is too small and worse gote (see alternative from 71)]
;W[co]C[*X*: Seeing this, I doubted the wisdom of cutting off two stones in t
he top right.  White has an awful lot of  potential territory in the bottom le
ft.  Is there a way for me to get in there?
------
That seems late for an invasion (maybe a small life by ko), but right now it's
 better to play arround d8]
(;B[fp]C[ajikeshi move (this move fix the position)
If white answer the corner is definitively white];W[fq]C[now no hope to get something in the corner]
;B[dl];W[cg]
(;B[ef]C[wrong side. Here also you must attack to push white towards your strong formation (the shimari)]
;W[df];B[de];W[eg];B[ff];W[id]
(;B[hd];W[he];B[ge]C[*X*: Duh... G16 instead.

yes];W[hc];B[gd];W[hb];B[gc];W[gb];B[fb];W[ib]
(;B[hf]C[*X*: Too small?  I felt that the extra strength up here would
 be useful, whereas if he pulled that stone out, he could get a bunch of extra
 territory in the middle...
------
Black is overconcentred here, so It's better to use this move to attack the weak white group (see variation)]

(;B[am]C[this yose is not urgent ; the white group seems not very healty (see variations from 119)

There is a lot of variations in this position and even if white get a small life it will be gote. So don't miss this opportunity: try to kill it.]
;W[bn]C[Now white got a big sure territory in the corner.

The game is now very good for white.
