C[Dear reviewer!

I am a European amateur 2d, calling myself HonFu in the GTL.

In this game, although fighty, I felt largely in control of what was happening and assumed that I would win by a few points, but in the end there were a few bad surprises ...

In the game I have added comments about my decisions and assumptions about where I went wrong. I'd like you to correct my thinking and spot out any mistakes you find.

Thank you! :-)];B[pd];W[qp];B[dp];W[dd];B[op];W[mq];B[qq];W[qm]

reid: Yes, I agree.  The L4 and M5 stones are nearly useless.  The P4 stones need eyes.  White, on the other hand, has no worries.]

(;W[ok]C[*Hon* So I pushed here, creating a miai.];B[lm];W[rj]
LB[pi:A]C[reid: I think white should leave this unplayed.

S10 is the kind of move you make when you're going to kill the group.  It loses points and aji on the outside.  White can play it later if the situation calls for it.

I would want to play directly at A instead.  If black responds with S10 to make eye shape, I would consider that a success for white.]
;B[rk];W[pi];B[qi];W[qh];B[oj];W[pj];B[qj];W[ph];B[nj];W[mk]
;B[rh];W[rg];B[sj]C[reid: Black is alive.

if we remove the S10-S9 exchange, black's life is not quite so easy.  At the very least, white would get more ko threats.]
;W[mi]LB[qf:B][qg:A]C[*Hon* Since I am out or alive everywhere now, I thought I have a good position.

reid: Yes.  Black has made very little territory so far, and assuming both the Q12 stones and the N9 stones stay alive, black can't expect much from the center.

We can say that the lower right side is equal in territory (about 5 points for each side).  Let's also say that D16 balances D4.  The L5 group is about 10 points for white, while the P4 group is only about 4 points for black.  H3 is very close to the strong white stones so we should only give it about two to four points (normally I'd say to give a single stone with no enemies nearby about 5 on the side to 10 in a corner).  So white is a couple points ahead before we consider the value of Q16 vs. the Q12/N9 structure.  I'd say white is ahead.

However, N11 doesn't seem to be quite the right spot (as your branch indicates).  The question here is which weakness does white want to protect?  To my eye, the cut at A (R13) kind of jumps out.  White could play at B, making good shape while attacking the black corner at the natural approach point.

Since both the M7 and the O10 stones are weak, the white N9 group is relatively strong.  If the Q12 group gets good shape, white has only one weak group to worry about, and it's splitting two weak black groups.]

;B[ri];W[qg]C[*Hon* Luckily Black defended for me.];B[pc];W[qe]
LB[kc:B][lc:A][ho:D][io:C]C[*Hon* In hindsight I think I should have just played A or something like that.

reid: Yes, A or B would be better.  But I'm thinking that this whole corner, starting from white O17, isn't the real proirity at the moment.

Black could seal white in with a move like C.  White should pull this group out and keep the M7 group unsettled with a move like D perhaps.]

;W[ib];B[lg]C[*Hon* In the game I felt not completely happy, but relieved, that everything survived. Black got a ponnuki, but right between my strong groups, its influence should be manageable. Also I got sente.

But later I got some problems here ...

reid: Yes, black was able to turn the tables a bit here.  White survives, but his advantage is gone - black no longer has weak groups to worry about (M7 is still a bit weak, even after J7, but now there's a safe haven at M13 to run towards).]

(;W[cn]LB[ho:A]C[reid: Keeping black split with something around A seems more urgent to me.]
;B[dk];W[cq]LB[en:A]C[reid: C3 doesn't take advantage of the M7 group not being completely settled yet.  White should jump out to A to keep the black groups from easily joining forces.  Leave C3 for later (maybe).]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[fq]LB[er:A][fr:B]
C[*Hon* This move here gives Black a move at A, but I thought, B just wasn't sente enough. I wanted to keep the initiative and play something on the left side.

reid: Hmm, living in the corner is almost always a gote choice.  It's the trade-off for the large territorial exchange (opponent's corner becoming yours).

F3 keeps sente now, perhaps, but it loses it later when black takes advantage of the weak spot.

In the long run, the way to keep sente is to not leave weak points behind.  Even if it means gote in the short run.]
;B[ho];W[ip];B[hp];W[km];B[kl];W[kn];B[ll]LB[in:A]C[*Hon* I exchanged these moves in sente to be 100% alive at the bottom. Like this I created problems for myself though.

reid: Yes.  Probably better to leave L7 and L6 unplayed, at least.  Black's responses weaken the N10 group quite a bit.

The proverb says 'run before living'.  Instead of J4, I'd probably probe the weak point of  A (J6) and see how black responds.  At the least, you might be able to lay waste the moyo black is starting to build here.]
;W[cf];B[er];W[eq];B[fr];W[dr];B[gr];W[bs];B[ch];W[ec]C[*Hon* I had assumed, that territorially a sequence like this would be okay for me.

reid: The territory between E17 and J18 is reduced in value because of the strong black presence around L14 and because the L18 stones are already alive.  It might be better to take a firmer grip on the corner with D17.]
;B[pb];W[jd]LB[rd:A]C[reid: It might actually be bigger to play A (S16).  The K17 stones can live pretty easily, even if black takes the two P17 stones.]
;B[pf];W[rf];B[ki]TR[kl][ll]C[*Hon* But when he played here, it was sente against my group on the right. I suppose it was a mistake after all to give my opponent the two marked stones.

reid: Yah.];W[rc];B[eg];W[ff]C[*Hon* At this point I pondered for a while, counted and found, that this modest reduction would be enough to maintain territorial balance.]

;B[iq]LB[jl:A]C[*Hon* Here I think I should have captured at A, creating a miai of killing.

reid: Yes, good point.  The capture also alleviates the white shortage of liberties so you can take away black's eye after he captures J4.]

;B[be]C[*Hon* And now my opponent suddenly entered and I couldn't handle it. Indulging this, letting him out, was just too much to allow.

reid: Ouch!  this is too complicated for me to read out.  I'm guessing that if white blocks at C15, black can either live in the corner or connect.  He certainly can get a ko at least.]

;W[cd];B[bd]C[*Hon* After this, the game was lost. I still tried to pull tricks, but in vain.

reid:.  White had a good posiition early on, but then got into trouble in the upper right corner and black turned the game around.

I think white should focus on two things: 

First: it can be worth taking gote in exchange for settling a group.  If all of your groups are safe, your opponent cannot attack you, and by definition, you get sente back.  Having settled groups/situations is a very powerful bargaining position.  I often say "If my opponent has two weak groups, I can win the game."

Second, don't play unnecessary moves.  It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking "It's sente, it must be good".  Not true.  The only good move is the move that's necessary right now.  

When you consider forcing moves, think about whether the response helps your opponent.  Consider whether there are other ways to probe or take advantage of the weakness.  If there are, can you defer playing until you have a better idea if which way you want to probe?  Sometimes your opponent might take gote to defend the forcing move you decided not to play.  That's OK too, you still get sente.  

Good luck, play strong

(;W[pn]C[reid: how about going this way instead?];B[pl];W[qn]
C[reid: white's corner is stable now, and the bottom edge group has a nice base.  White only has to look out for the O7 stones, which are a splitting attack on the P4 and the Q9 groups.  The P4 stones seriously need to find eyes, and the Q9 stones don't have very good shape.

This seems like a good, perhaps even a winning position.])))
