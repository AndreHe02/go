C[Hi Fransesco,

I'm Dieter, 2d in Belgium. I've been to Italy a few times, most notably biking from Firenze to Roma.

I believe there are two areas of improvement for you, which are:

1) Basic Technique
2) Importance of stones

For technique I recommend the following reading:
 
- http://senseis.xmp.net/?HaengmaTutorialForBeginners (a long article)
- http://senseis.xmp.net/?SmallGaps (a small article)
- http://senseis.xmp.net/?LameDuGo

For importance of stones and areas, let's have a look at the game. My comments are preceded by "dv:"]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[iq]LB[ip:A][jp:B]C[hi suppose thi is slow

dv: It is rather low than slow. But it is not that big a mistake. It's just more natural to play A or B, making a wave-like formation at the bottom.]
;W[nc];B[kd];W[qc]C[i think which that pince i shoul place in

dv: The jump into the corner is natural.];B[qd]CR[qj]LB[pc:A]
C[dv: A mistake by Black: he is building a wall without an extension. He should play at A, cutting your stones. Only if he has a stone around the circled point, he can build a wall.]
;W[pc];B[qg];W[od]C[Theme 1

dv: Very good! This is the proper technique.];B[rc];W[rb];B[oe]
;W[ne]C[dv: You have no work to do. Black is inviting you to make natural moves to your advantag. Good!]
;B[of];W[rd]C[Theme 2: both groups are relatively stable, so there is no need for you to give up sente here.

Instead you could look for a big area now, to develop.

Go is about stability (urgent) and development (big). There are no urgent moves now, so you can play a big one.

Any idea?];B[re]LB[cj:A][qo:B]C[dv: as an answer to my question, I would have played A or B in your stead.]
;W[sc];B[md]C[Black gets sente.];W[nd]C[dv: This is natural. Good.]
;B[fc];W[hc]CR[kd][md]LB[df:A]SQ[nc][nd][ne]C[maybe this is ovreplay?

dv: I don't think this is overplay, but it is not the biggest area. You are strong at the top (square stones) but Black has some high stones (circled) which cannot be easily attacked on a large scale. Therefore the top is not so big.

You should continue answering his hard work and play naturally: a move at A strengthens your corner stone and develops the big left side.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[jc];W[he];B[lf];W[rf]LB[ec:B][ff:A]C[too soon

dv: Yes. There is no need to play here. You should continue in the upper left. I like A, aiming for influence at the left side, sacrificing the top stones.]
;B[qe];W[se];B[qf];W[me];B[le];W[hg]C[dv: ok. The exchange at the top right did not lose sente, fortunately.

This move continues to fight at the top, which is not my preference, but it is consistent.]
;B[fg];W[dh]C[dv: As you can see, you are playing on both sides. This is easy for Black, who only needs to continue and split your stones.]
;B[db]LB[fi:A]C[dv: A mistake: Black should split at A.];W[cc]
LB[fh:A][hi:B]C[dv: I would consider A, or B.];B[hh];W[gf];B[ff]
;W[ih];B[gh];W[if];B[jg];W[ig];B[ie];W[id];B[je];W[gd]LB[mg:B]
[ij:A]C[dv: This is a tactical/strategic error. Instead of making eyes, you should jump out into the center. It is not easy for Black to attack your group, since his own group can be split at B.]
;B[fd];W[ge];B[gc];W[gg]C[dv: Again, it is strange to make eyes before escaping. Sometimes this is better, if escape would damage someting else. But here you would escape into neutral area.]
;B[hb]C[dv: This move connects all Black stones. Black is now strong on the board. On the other hand, this move is also small.]
;W[fh]LB[ij:A]C[dv: It is still better to jump out at A, as the game will show.]
;B[eh];W[fi];B[hi]C[dv: Black complicates the game. That is natural because he is behind.]
;W[ii];B[hj];W[ij];B[hk];W[li]LB[hb:B][mg:A]C[dv: Good. You are now escaping into the wide area, while threatening a cut. The problem is that Black has connected all his stones with B and you have but a ko there.]
;B[ei];W[di];B[dg];W[cg];B[eg];W[ce];B[dj];W[cj];B[ck];W[ci]
;B[co];W[do];B[cp];W[cq];B[cn];W[cm];B[bm]
(;W[cl]C[dv: This is bad technique (theme 1). See variations.]
;B[bl];W[dk];B[bk];W[ej];B[bq];W[cr];B[dm];W[dl];B[br]LB[em:A]
(;W[eq]LB[em:A]SQ[cq][cr]C[dv: You must connect at A. See variation.

Theme 2: the marked stones are not important. Black lives in the corner. But the whole group is very important, since it influences the lower side.]
;B[em];W[fr];B[gq];W[fp];B[dr];W[dq];B[gr];W[er];B[fo]C[dv: Black plays very aggressively. White is in trouble, because if the fight moves to the centre, the other group will also be threatened.]
(;W[en]C[Theme 1: cut across the keima, see var];B[fm];W[fn]
;B[go];W[gm];B[fl]C[dv: Black does not care about empty triangles, it seems. He fights well.]
;W[gl]C[dv: If it does not work, it is better not to play it.]
;B[fk];W[gk];B[fj]C[dv: Black becomes stronger by getting this capture for free.]
;W[gn];B[ik];W[ho];B[gp];W[im];B[jk];W[jf];B[kg];W[kj];B[jj]
;W[ji];B[kh];W[ki];B[kk];W[io]C[dv: A good move! Your first group is now alive and you have free hands to deal with the other.]
;B[kp];W[lk];B[jn];W[in];B[mj];W[mh];B[mg];W[mk];B[nj];W[lj]
;B[ng];W[nk];B[oj];W[ok];B[pk];W[pl];B[pj];W[nm];B[ql];W[pm]
TR[da][ja][jb][oh][rh][sh][oi][ak][rl][sl][lq][ar][lr][gs][ls]
SQ[na][nb][ac][bc][ah][bh]C[dv: And so is the other.

This is a time to pause and look at the position.

1- White has 20 points + 5 komi

2 - Black has about 40 points and a corner to develop.

Black has also sente so it seems that his attack has brought a lot of success.

This means you should now look for his weakest group and attack it. Since all your groups are alive, you can play aggressively.]
;B[qm]
(;W[qn]C[dv: A natural move but ...

See variation];B[pn]C[dv: But Black is quite a fighter!];W[on]
;B[po];W[qp];B[pp];W[qq];B[qo];W[qr];B[pr];W[rp]LB[ro:A]C[dv: This is a mistake in life and death. Black A kills. See http://senseis.xmp.net/?LGroup]
;B[sq]C[dv: Clearly, Black does not know this shape either.]
;W[sr];B[rr];W[rs]C[dv: Good!];B[ss];W[gj];B[gi];W[sr];B[hl]
;W[hm];B[ss];W[bp];B[bo];W[sr];B[ol];W[om];B[ss];W[ao];B[ap]
;W[sr];B[cb];W[rq]LB[rn:B][mq:A]C[dv: Good! The ko is big because you can now look at an attack at A, combined with the aji at B]
;B[bf];W[be];B[bc];W[bd];B[dc];W[cd];B[bh];W[bi];B[ac];W[bg]
;B[mc];W[mb]LB[mp:B][mq:A]C[dv: I believe you have been playing automatically where the opponent plays, the last moves.

Being behind, you should look for an attack. A/B is a splendid opportunity]
;B[lb];W[nb];B[lc];W[rn]LB[mp:A]C[dv: Good! But maybe better A first]
;B[ro];W[so];B[no];W[lp]C[dv: Good!];B[lo]C[overplay?];W[ko]
;B[mp];W[jp];B[kq];W[jq];B[jo];W[ip]C[dv: A great success!]
;B[kr];W[jr];B[jm];W[ks]C[dv: Very good endgame!

I will not discuss the endgame, since I believe you did well there and we should not over-analyze. See last move.]

dv: To repeat the highlights,

- move 20 lost sente
- you should have escaped into the centre with your top group from move 50 onward
- move 96 protected unimportant stones and got your group in trouble, instead, capturing at 97 would have solved all problems
- the ko in the bottom left was the start of a good come back; it does not exist though (study the L-group)
- 204-206 was a splendid crosscut maneuvre to continue the come back
- decent endgame got you victory in the end

Enjoy the game!])
