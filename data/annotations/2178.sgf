C[Joey - Hi, I thought i was leading in the
beginning, then toward the end of the middle game it got really close.  I
would like some opinions on why I actually ended up losing in this game.

Kahoumono (k): Hi Joey, I found your game very interesting to analyse as it reminds a lot of the problems I faced in my own games recently.
I hope my comments are helpful and provide you with some new ideas which you can use in your following games. Please regard my comments only as suggestions as I'm a novice as you in this game and as only a pro really understands this game ;-).  Now to your game:  I wasn't able to see any blunt mistakes till the end of the game  but many slight mistakes which summed up to the result that you lost the game. Your main source of mistakes is based on the direction of play. I suggest you read the book "The Direction of Play" by Takeo Kajiwara.]

- I almost always start with a knight enclosure and a star point at 2 corners.
 Is this a bad habit?

k: In my opinion, it isn't a bad habit, it's simply a matter of personal style.]
;W[ci];B[fc]LB[ck:B][cl:A]C[k: Following the idea of komoku, I would play at 'A' trying to build a box shape moyo on the left side.
    'B' could provoke either an invasion at c7 or e11];W[cf]
LB[jd:A]C[k: A would also be a nice idea.];B[db];W[cc];B[ic]
;W[bm];B[qf];W[nc];B[rd];W[qc];B[qi];W[gq];B[iq];W[go];B[eo]
;W[jp]TR[iq]C[k: Instead of playing f7 I would have looked after the lone marked stone. see variation
    I see that you were anxious about being shut in in the corner. Playing the knight's move doesn't
    seem appropriate here. A more aggressive move is the capping at d7, threatening, to cut off the      white stone at b7 and the make profit. If white answers with c9 you can press him into a low
    position. see variation.]
(;B[fm]
(;W[dm]C[k: k3 is better for white. He's able to get a thick position on the lower side, reducing the influence of black's hoshi stone.]
;B[hm];W[ip];B[kq];W[jq];B[kp];W[jn];B[kn];W[jm]
(;B[ik]C[k: In my opinion, j9 is the wrong direction to play as you invite white to play in your sphere of influcence. You help your opponent to reduce your potential territory. I would push white one more time with l7 and then secure the corner or simply protect the corner by playing r4 now.  see variation]
;W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[k: your stones became overconcentrated if you blockfrom the smaller side. Play r4 instead.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq]
;W[kl]
(;B[kj]C[Joey - I was trying to chase white while building some influence in the center.

k: It's a good idea but capping at l10 seems to be the wrong direction because you help white further to reduce your moyo on the right and because the left side is dominated by white which nullifies any effort from your side to build center influence.  As white's stones are almost all on the third line I would play some capping moves which will prevent whitefrom accessing the center and buildung up some influence of yours.  see variation]
;W[ml];B[mj];W[lm];B[ln];W[mn];B[mo];W[ek];B[fk]C[k: f14 is bigger than f9.]
;W[ff];B[ee]C[Joey - Trying to punish white for going too deep

k: White hasn't gone too deep at all. It's on the border where both spheres of influence meet.]

(;B[ig]C[k: Instead of defending the cut h13 I would play m17 which is bigger as white has to answer it. see variation]
;W[kc];B[kf]C[Joey - I think i played that too conservatively, resulting in white getting a lot more moyo on top

k: Have a look at the previous comment. Try to distinguish between urgent and large points.]
;W[jd];B[id];W[ie];B[jb]C[Joey - gote end-game move?

k: No, I don't think so. If you want to keep this group alive it's a necessary move.]
;W[kb];B[jc];W[kd];B[je]C[k: A small move. This cut isn't a threat for white at all. A bigger and urgent point is o14.]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[le];B[lf];W[mf];B[mg];W[nf];B[ng];W[og];B[of]
;W[pf];B[oe];W[me];B[pg];W[pe];B[oh];W[rc]LB[ok:B][rm:A][bo:E]
[fr:D][kr:C]C[Joey - at this point, i thought there is no big play on the top-right area anymore.

k: Well, if you simply play s15 it will prevent the following white manoeuvre. However it's a gote move worth approx. 3 points. So if there's anything bigger on the board, play it, e.g. A, B,C etc. I think A is the biggest point and should be played immediately.]
;B[nn];W[re];B[qe];W[qd];B[rf];W[sd]
(;B[qg]C[k: This is overcautiously played. Even if white hanes at t14 nothing serious happens. In this stage of the endgame you should be concerned about big yose points.  see variation.]
;W[mm];B[nm];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[nj];W[ok];B[oj];W[pk];B[qk]
;W[pj];B[qj];W[pl];B[pm];W[jr];B[gr]TR[kr]C[Joey - not really expecting to save the j-3 stone, but hoping to scoop up some territory

k: g2 is an overplay in my opinion as you end up in gote and you give white an additional 2 points. Simply play f2 in a similar situation but you'll find a more urgent point on the right. Think how many points you will loose if white plays m2 or the monkey jump to n1.  L2 is a must in this situation, unless you find a point worth more than 5 points.]
;W[hr];B[hq];W[hp];B[fq];W[gp];B[fs]
(;W[kr]C[k: the monkey jump to n1 is reducing black's moyo even further.]

(;B[gi]C[Joey
- I took that stone to prepare to invade the left side, but now it seems
pretty useless

k: As far as I can see, there's no way to invade the left side but a small reduction is still possible with moves such as e10, e8 etc.  What you should consider now is the white centre group. It is not yet fully alive. So try to put pressure on it.  see variation.]
