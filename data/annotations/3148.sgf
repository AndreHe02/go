C[Hello, I'll try to bring in some material for you.

Overall, you did not play very badly.
I just think you tended to forget the big places on the board, while you were concentrating on small issues on the top right side, while fighting with W.

Besides, you played a couple of moves that did nothing. That would probably have given you the game if you played elsewhere, but not more;

I suggest, you don't submit too much to the flow of your opponent, and sometimes take the initiative. With sente, you could have made a large difference sometimes in the game.

Hope this helps.];B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[qe]C[I would have played the shmari on the other side, with Q17 facing it, but this is not bad in any way.]
;W[oq];B[qn]MA[pn][qm]C[R8 does not exist ... too small and submissive.
Usual joseki are at Q6 or R7];W[qq];B[rq];W[qr]C[Not in the spirit either. Should be Q4.
But not a mistake at this stage.];B[jc]SQ[pc][qe]C[Good !
Making efficient use uf the shimari];W[kp];B[pj]SQ[pc][qe]TR[qn]
[qp]C[This is ok, but I would not have played here.


The reason is : if W plays here, he will live small between the two B formations.
On the other hand, there is plenty of open space on the left side to claim for B


However, this brings you full efficiency of the shimari];W[pl]
C[Too early. This will help Black.

There are bigger points on the left side];B[ql];W[pm];B[qm]
;W[po]
(;B[pk]C[I don't think you need to play here.
Grab sente.];W[qo];B[ro];W[pp];B[rp];W[pn];B[cn]MA[cf]C[I would have played on the lonely D16 stone ...]
;W[qg]C[wanted to go to r11 or around there wasn't sure.

Again, I don't think you even need to answer this, if you want to grab big points on the left side.]

(;B[oh]C[good.
P14 also possible

Your right group is alive, so no need to protect at R11.

If R11, W will run to the centre, and then damage your top.]
;W[og];B[ng];W[of]
(;B[nh]C[yes.];W[nf];B[md]C[yes.];W[mf];B[lh];W[nd];B[nc];W[kf]

(;B[qi]C[i thought this move was needed so he didnt try to live underneth

No, this is not consistent with your previous sequence, which was good.
W will get out now, and it is much more profitable to have him live very small than to let him get out.
D16 is too much of a help here.

You could run ahead of W and make territory on top instead.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[pd];B[qd]C[This sequence helps B];W[qf];B[le]
C[ok, a kikashi. But I hope you now how to use a kikashi !]
;W[lf];B[jh]TR[nd][nf][od][of][og][qf][qg]MA[cf]LB[rd:2][re:1]
[sf:3]C[should ive gone to q15 instead? In the game I was thinking about
it but just decieded on this move instead

Q15 : useless. You can't cut W (two bamboo joints). And supressing the eye is of very small interest. W can make one right (W1, B2, W3), and then run again

K12 : ok

C14, still bigger];W[pe];B[rc]C[No. W can't cut you (just check it out)]
;W[re]C[But you are lucky, W wastes one move as well];B[fd]
MA[cf][df]C[good idea, just wrong side ...];W[ke];B[ld]TR[le]
[md]C[L16 would have been a better move

Yes. What are you doing with an empty triangle  ? (this deserves a good ear pinch)

Besides, remember M15 was a kikashi. It has done its job and can be spent. (I'm not saying it "should")]
;W[ec];B[fc]TR[fd][jc]C[good exchange for B. shape ideal];W[cf]
;B[dj];W[go]C[This is greedy. a B invason inside would suceed.
Normal play is G3 for balance]
(;B[jo]C[ok

I give you a possibility inside.];W[jp];B[ko];W[lo];B[km];W[lm]
;B[ll];W[mm];B[ml];W[gl];B[eo]C[i was thinking about invading at 3-3 but i got frustrated about if i should or not and so i played this move.

I prefer 3-3.

It if fairly big for B, either side W blocks];W[ep];B[cq]C[then i decide to do it any way but my last move hurt me]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr]C[should i have gone to d1?

No, B4 makes you alive , but it's not so good for the left stones if W blocks]

;B[dl];W[ek];B[ej]C[I should have minded the gap here and filled it in then i could have bend,should have blocked at d9 instead

yes];W[dk];B[cl];W[ck];B[bk];W[cj];B[fj];W[bj];B[bl];W[dh]C[yes, this exchange favors W.

However, you still have cutting points to exploit around L5 (see possible variations next stone)]

(;B[eh]
(;W[il]C[white could have cut me off at L8 right?

He "could, but may be he read the reason why not ...];B[jl]
;W[io];B[kn]MA[im][in]C[second ear pinch !

this is a bad shape !

Anything here is better than L6];W[ln]C[every time you make a bad move, W makes an other one.]
;B[in];W[hn];B[im]MA[cc][ik][rd]C[too small. You have a big play at C17, for instance, or sente at S16, or even protect your territory at J9.]

yes.

(;B[rj]C[What do you fear ?
Cut first, think after !
(okay, this is harsh, but often works :-)

No seriously : this W stone on the second line is greedy. Try not to submit.]

some where else, like where white played next

You connect when groups are not fully alive or when you have aji inside, or else.]
