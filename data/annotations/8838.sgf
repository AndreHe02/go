C[Hi this is Kheng Hun reivewing this game, I will add KH: in front of the comments that I make.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[ci];W[fq]C[Is this the right move against the chinese opening?

KH: this move is fine, you can read up more @ http://senseis.xmp.net/?PlaysAgainstLowChineseOpening]
;B[cm]C[KH: this move is less common though. not that good for black. C6 or D6 should be better.]
;W[jp];B[nc];W[pf];B[pb]C[Black made a mistake here. So white got a lot of territory.

KH: while black playing at l16 or K16 seems better, this is also playable for black]
;W[qc];B[kc]C[KH: This move is too low, playing on the 4th line at M16 or L16 is better]
;W[qi]C[KH: this seems a bit passive, IMO F5 looks more important. however, if you want to play at the right hand side, maybe you can consider R10 since it is closer to the bottom right corner.]
;B[qn]
(;W[ql]C[Was this pincer correct? Was there a better pincer/move?

KH: While this move looks fine, I can also suggest other moves.]
;B[on];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[mn]
(;W[lq]C[KH: this move looks a little weird though. M4 looks better.]
;B[qp]C[I think this is a mistake as well, but I am not sure whats the best way for white to answer...?

KH: yes this move is a mistake.]
(;W[po];B[pn];W[ol];B[rq]C[White ignored this move because I think the answer move would be to small.]

(;W[in]C[Better move for white?];B[nf];W[kl];B[jm];W[jl];B[im]
(;W[ni]TR[pf]C[After the game this move looked really bad. In the actual game black cut through the marked stones and erased some of whites potential territory.

KH: The position of this move is strange.]
(;B[cf]C[KH: this move is not good for enclosing the corner really. 
The other moves I suggest should be better.];W[jd];B[gc]
(;W[jc];B[kd];W[je];B[ke];W[ge]C[Unfortunatly I dont remember the next move. In the game white couldnt link up with his group in the middle, but survived in blacks territory, with some loses. I was suprised that white won in the end with 63,5 to 51 points.

Thank you for reviewing : )])
