C[Hello to my dear reviewer,

I'm cb22, 6k KGS and I play black in this game. The game was quite even (until I make a big mistake) and I would like to know what are my weak points.

I really want to improve my way of playing. It's hard to change my style of play, which is kinda automatic. I don't know how to construct my reflection about what to play ! - I impose myself to find 3 good things about why to play a point and not another, but sometime my hand don't wait !

I'll hope you will enjoy to review my game !

Hello, Clement, I am Bernd from Germany, I play as HonFu (1d) on KGS. I suffer from the blitz-disease myself and have found no solution for it yet. If you play quickly, you got to rely on your intuition.

If I should say which is your largest weak point, I would say it is your perception of the safety of groups. In many cases you did not kill when you had a good chance, and you died where you didn't need to. I hope that after this review your intuition for that aspect of the game will have improved a bit!]
;B[qd]C[I wanted to start with a double komoku opening, but I don't know if it's playable whatever my opponent does...

Hon.: It is.];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[nc]C[Is there a better corner in this position ? (R5/6 extension)

I hesitate here with P17 and M17. I like those 3 extensions.

Hon: Securing the upper right corner is normal, since white would attack there next and at the same time extend from D17.

If he attacks your lower right, that stone will be inside your moyo, and it will have no relation to the lower left, so that is in theory good for you.

How you save the upper right is a matter of taste. P17 is most solid, and the farther you extend from there, the more it changes from territory to moyo.]
;W[qj];B[qn]LB[po:B][qo:A]C[Is it too timid ? I know that the R10 invasion is miai generally but I didn't want to let white put pressure on my Q3 stone and let him have a 3 space extension.

Hon: This move is the most normal move.

Traditionally white would prevent the second shimari at A or B. Since he did not do it, you take the shimari. The point you took is the only one, because now the right side is NOT miai anymore (see variation). White has to extend, and then you have sente and can go on with the opening.]

(;W[qf]
(;B[qh]C[Is the invasion too early or too risky ? I felt it was good for me as this side was dominated by black

Hon: I think, you can invade here, but there is some bad aji in the corner, since you went to O17 and not P17 (see variation).]

(;W[of]
(;B[oh]
(;W[ql];B[oj]C[Hon: This is normally bad shape, when R10 has help at R8.]

(;W[ok];B[nk]C[I don't think the hane was the good answer (or maybe on the other side at Q9?). I wanted to put pressure on the 3 white stones and attack the 2 upper white stones.

Hon: If you want to build up influence to attack the upper group, then the hane is just right.]
;W[ol]
(;B[on];W[nj]
(;B[ni]C[Hon: This kind of atari normally is bad, because you help him to get out.]
;W[mj]
(;B[ml];W[pj];B[oi]
(;W[ri]C[Hon: Thank you, white!];B[rh]C[I played on the second line to not let white connect.

Hon: Good.];W[nm];B[ll]C[Hon: A bit timid, but I see what you were afraid of.

If you have to ensure connection, at least take the diagonal move!]
;W[kj];B[lo];W[eq]C[Hon. Hm. can you kill him now? 

Since you played the surrounding move at M5, it would at least be the logical thought now.]

(;B[de]C[White as made a shimari I can't let him have a second one. But maybe the approach is wrong ?

Hon: From the viewpoint of opening theory this is logical, but there is an important go proverb.

"Urgent before big!"

When there is the life or death of large groups at stake, then you do not play large moves. 

You can see that when you watch a dan game on KGS. The board seems quite open, and there is lots of place on the sides, but the players rather play out a running battle. Why? Because matters of life and death, of attack and defence, always have priority before large points!]

(;W[dh];B[ge];W[gc];B[fh];W[eg];B[ff]C[I really liked this move, allowing black to connect his four stones and keeping white separated.

Hon: I also like this kind of moves. :-)];W[ck];B[fc];W[fd]
;B[gd];W[fb];B[hc]C[I'm still trying to isolate the two white stones on the left and create a big territory

Hon: Do you mean the two white stones on the right? That's where your focus should go. And to the other weak group around L10.

The strategy should now be, as you do, to build some influence in sente, then to split those two groups, start a double attack and kill one of them. If they don't die, at least get more influence and points at the top. 

But really - one of them should die.];W[gb]
(;B[iq]LB[kq:A]C[Hon: This totally disregards the urgent matters at hand. 

Furthermore, it is not a very good point, since it has no good connection to the M5 stone. Your stone, if played in this area at all, should be at some place like A.]

(;W[ic]C[Hon: Why are we playing endgame now? :)];B[hb];W[mf]

(;B[lh]C[Hon: Now white should see that he lives at the top, no matter how.]

(;W[ij]

;W[kh];B[li];W[lj];B[lf];W[mg]
(;B[jg]C[I wasn't afraid of the white cut as I can still connect with S14, but maybe there was a better move?]
;W[lg]C[Hon: Now white can cut and use the bad aji to live, although he should have just died a natural death.]
;B[rf]C[Hon: Now white should just try to live.]
(;W[qg];B[rg];W[pc]C[Hon: Terrible. 

White can not invade, when he's dying on the outside. Even in a handicap game this would be risky.]
;B[pd];W[oc];B[od];W[nb];B[mc];W[le]
(;B[mb];W[ig]
(;B[je]C[Big mistake here... It's maybe what cost me the sure win...

Hon: The actual mistakes were earlier, where you waited for your opponent's weakness to just be repaired, and did not attack immediately.]
;W[jf];B[ie];W[kd];B[jc];W[nn]C[Hon: So here white aims on your thinness. You got to find a way to solidify.]
;B[no];W[oo]
(;B[op]C[Hon: Like this you just invite the counter atari.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[mo];B[np];W[mp];B[mn];W[ln];B[mm];W[kn]C[Hon: I think, if you can, you have to refuse coming under attack. This is YOUR territory!]

(;B[ko]C[Hon: Like this you are pushing him from behind. That is generally bad, especially if you push him into a direction he wants to go anyway. Like here towards the outside, aiming at the thinness around K7.]
;W[jn];B[jo]C[Hon: Even worse ...];W[in]C[Hon: ... since now J7 gets actually hurt. 

But once started, it was hard to stop the pushing action. I can see the problem ... consider the easier variations I showed you.]
;B[om]C[Hon: This move forces him to connect, but his connection will make him atari the crucial cutting stone at P9. Stones that cut groups apart shouldn't be lost, so you can't easily sacrifice it. 

Which means, P7 is a move that hurts yourself more than him.]
;W[nl];B[io]C[Hon: The final push ...];W[hn]C[Hon: ... and he's out.

Remember, because it's very important and basic. Don't push from behind!]

Hon: Haha, not at all! :)

I think that you tend to get confused in fights and lose out of sight what is important. When there is a group to kill, your sword is not ready, or not sharp. But even when it is not about killing, you play sequences that rather help the opponent than you, or you overlook a tesuji that would help you or hurt him.

In short - you should work at your fighting skill. 

Two basic ways to do this:

1.) Improve your reading ability. Two good books I can recommend:

Richard Bozulich: 1001 Life and Death Problems
Richard Bozulich: Get Strong at Tesuji

Work with these books like you would in a gym - repeat them over and over (then look for harder ones), until your reading muscle grows really big and flexible.

2.) Improve your fighting strategy. One book I like explains the basics and also tells you a lot of details of what is a good, solid move with proper technique in any given situation.
