C[Hey reviewer!  Really close game... lost by 4.5 points.  Had a few questions about my logic of a few moves, but mostly neither of us made any huge and visible mistakes (to me) so I guess I'm looking for more general hints on how I could've turned the game closer to my favor.  Thanks :-)

Sure thing! I'll do my best.];B[pd]C[dfoiaufa [15k?\]: hi];W[dd]

LB[lb:A]C[I wasn't sure how to respond to this, because it isn't any joseki I've learned.  So I thought maybe I'd attack his m16 stone... but maybe A would've been better...

A is probably a better move. Black N17 splits your stones into two groups which undesirable.]
;B[mc];W[nd];B[nb];W[pf]C[I sat and wondered why the joseki was the way it was, and figured that black wanted to extend out to this side.  So I took it from him/her.  Maybe later build a base there or get some shape if that option is taken.

Your white group needs a base or at least a bit more safety so this is a good move. If black plays Q14 instead of white the white group is in danger and black is in a better situation since he can toy with the white weak group having his way.]
;B[qe];W[qf];B[rf];W[qi]C[Extending for a base.  Maybe a mistake?  This group winds up living anyways.  But that could be more of b's fault than my skill.

No it's probably a good idea. The white group needs the base for saftey.]
;B[qj];W[jj]C[I thought this would be a good fuseki move, builds a moyo upper right and supports upper right stones in danger.

It's a moyo alright but whites stones are pretty scattered. Personaly I whould have gone for a defensive move first. First of all one secures terretory in corners (the easiest place to protect), then one secures sides and last one grabs terretory in the center. In this game the corners and sides are very unprotected and invites the other player to invade.]
;B[ke];W[je]C[Slow?

No but it doesn't protect your upper side effectively. Black F17 would be hard to stop. Black wants to go the way you are pushing him. He's attacking the white group.]
;B[lg];W[mf]C[I realized I was losing space fast, so I started to build shape.

Good, otherwise the white group would be in great trouble.]
;B[lf];W[mg];B[lh];W[jg]C[I thought as things were my shape on the right was ok, so I instead fortified my moyo.  I figured it was a bigger move, and helping the group wasn't urgent.]
;B[mh];W[nh];B[ni];W[oh];B[oi];W[ph];B[lj];W[qg]C[I got a little more worried here and played it safe.

why not S13 or Q15?];B[kl];W[jl];B[jn]C[now you have a big nice wall in the center to protect your left side but it's open on the other side to invation. Black should have invaded your moyo.]
;W[hq]LB[hn:B][ho:A][jr:C]C[I guess this was sort of a cap move... it just looked good to me.  Sort of a probe as well.  B could extend into my territory with A or B, or defend the moyo with C.  Either way, I'd take the other spot.

It's not solid. Black K2, white H5 and then black G2 would force you away from the edge. If black plays C white should protect against G2 instead.]
;B[jr];W[qq]C[First, though, I thought it bigger to invade his corner and take out a good sized chunk of the moyo.

You should fortify your moyo instead. This corner attack is a standard joseki so you know it will gain you about 30p. Much less than black will destroy if he successfully invades your side.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]
;B[qn];W[in]C[I played this as opposed to farther away because I've heard (and learned from experience) that touching is best for defense, and distance is best for attack.  So I played it close.

This is correct however it is easy for black to cut here. Play contact to protect does not apply here. White is trying to protect to much at the same time. It's better to protect what is possible then to loose it all.]
;B[jm];W[im];B[jk];W[il];B[ik];W[kk]C[I knew this cut was going to die... but I thought I'd gain some good aji from it. Maybe a mistake considering I lost by 4 points...

Yes this is bad.. Black has pushed through your defense so your only option is to protect what you can.]
;B[kj];W[lk];B[ll];W[mk];B[ml];W[nk];B[nl];W[ok]C[I extended here to buy me some time to work on his groups.  I thought maybe I could pull something off.  And if nothing else, I could gain pretty much 5 free moves while b tries to kill it.  I thought that was worth the points.

As long as black responds with a black stone within his own terretory you don't loose any points. Howerer black will fortify his terretory with each move.]

;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[gb]C[Another unusual joseki... so I thought that the way to punish this was to reduce his territory on the left side.  Maybe I was a little too greedy.  Maybe that's not the way to punish this.  I dunno, but I don't like how it turned out.]
;W[bc]C[This is correct.];B[bb];W[cb];B[db];W[ab];B[ba];W[ad]
;B[hc];W[hd];B[ic];W[id];B[jc];W[kd];B[kc];W[gl];B[nj];W[cq]
C[I didn't want to lose another corner, so I was looking for enclosure moves and thought this was the best.  Winds up b takes just about as many points with the next attack.  I guess that's why they say 4th line is for influence, not territory...]
;B[cj]C[Yes... here comes the long awaited invation.];W[ck]
;B[ci];W[dk];B[bk];W[bl];B[ak];W[cm];B[cg];W[dg];B[af];W[bf]
;B[bg];W[cf];B[ai]C[I'm not sure, but I don't think I could've done any better here. Seemed pretty solid on both sides.  I think the most likely mistake on my part was 110, and I should've extended off of my upper group instead to reduce eyespace and force b to expand upward into my other stones.

To me it seems that you are lucky. Black could have done much more damage.]
;W[ip];B[jq];W[di];B[ch];W[ef];B[oj]C[I don't know why b did all of these moves... it seems foolish to me.  Count the liberties and play there when I'm actually threatening something...

Correct, black looses tempo and points by playing in his own terretroy like that.]
;W[hi];B[ri];W[rh];B[si];W[rg];B[re];W[pi];B[pe];W[og];B[od]
;W[ob]C[Moves like this have worked before for me.  I didn't read well enough ahead and in hindsight this was probably ajikeshi.  Oh well.]
;B[pb];W[mb];B[oa];W[md];B[lc];W[le]C[Now, this was a questionable move.  I've always figured the winner of a ko fight gets one extra point.  I thought this game was close and I could use it and I had a threat or two.  However, I really should've used it later when we were fighting for single points rather than now with many larger moves...]
;B[me];W[ca];B[da];W[le];B[kf];W[me];B[oe];W[of];B[gs];W[gr]
;B[hs];W[fr];B[fs];W[er]C[I kept expanding because I didn't know what to do.  I knew a hane would probably just result in a cut, so I stretched until I had my supporting stones (thank goodness).

There is not much else to do.];B[es];W[dr];B[ds];W[cs];B[ir]

I know, right?! SE says b +4...];B[mr];W[ns];B[ms];W[ps];B[sp]
;W[sq];B[so];W[jo];B[ko];W[io]C[I thought that would gain me a point, but it also seems very gote in hindsight... although it does leave aji at l6.  What do you think?

I think it did gain you at least a point. The alternative would have been black J5. But there are still sante moves left for white (T12), those should obviousley be played first.]
;B[kn];W[hl];B[hk];W[fk]C[Probably too small.];B[ki]C[J10, is sante.]
;W[jh];B[jf];W[if];B[ij];W[ii];B[kk];W[al]C[For some reason I thought I could cut at b10 and forgot about the stone at a11...

The black group is safe.];B[sh]C[Black needs to protect his group. Se variations.. white clould have killed blacks group here.]
