C[Hello, my name is Kyle Blocher, a 1d player from Bloomington, Indiana, USA.  I played this game with a Chinese player I happened to meet in Hong Kong while studying there.

We played a [timewise\] slow game and she resigned because I was visibly ahead and had to leave.  I had the better opening but I think I put myself into bad shape with my lower group in the midgame, causing me to make some concessions on my attacks; although I thought I had control of the middle game for the most part.

Her teacher made some comments about the game but I won't include them here because I'd like you to make your own [unbiased\] comments.

I will make a couple comments about what I thought about the various moves.

Thanks for your review!

Kyle Blocher];B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[qp];B[do]LB[jd:C][cn:A][dn:B]
C[Two komoku points indicates a territorial style.  With this move, I am trying to play the game on a very large scale.

reid: Hmmm, a bit early to declare that this is a territory vs. moyo style game.

But D5 invites white to pincer which leads the game towards a course of smaller fights.  If you would rather discourage the pincer and encourage a moyo game, playing black 5 at A, B, or C would be the way to go.]
;W[dl];B[cq]LB[fo:A][gp:B]C[With this move I try to settle in the corner, giving me a pincer on D10 later and developing a moyo in the upper left to work with the hoshi stone.

reid: black really doesn't have enough room to settle after white pincers with D8 (see comments later regarding a base in the corner).  A black jump to either A (which leads to rather simple continuations) or B (which can get into some very hairy patterns) is more usual.  See variations.

In any case, this is too early,  A consequence of playing in contact like this is that your opponent gets stronger ("you touch me, you help me").  See variation on move 11.]

(;W[cr];B[cp];W[er];B[br]C[reid: This is also too early.  See variations.]

(;W[fp]C[reid: as we show in the variations on the previous move, white should counter-hane here.  By not playing B1, the strategic situation is completely reversed: black can live at any time by playing C1, so white cannot apply any pressure on the black group.]
;B[dj]C[reid: This looks dangerous.  See variation.]
(;W[nc]C[reid:  There are two go proverbs that, if learned and applied consistently, are enough by themselves to make a shodan.  The first is "play away from strength" (doesn't apply here).  The second one is "play the urgent move, not the big move".  As we can see in the variation on the previous move, white has a chance to cause some serious damage to black.  By playing away, she gives black a chance to fix this problem.  The lower left corner is urgent.]
;B[jd]LB[lc:A][pf:B][qf:C]C[reid: this is a fairly weak attack against the o17 stone.  More usual is to pincer firmly (A) or to simply extend (B or C).]
;W[qf]C[reid: this is a good move by white - it is not easy for black to find a good answer.]
;B[qc]LB[qh:B][pj:A]TR[nc]C[Her teacher pointed out that this was a bad move.  I think it is a reasonable one - settle the corner and attack the squared stone.

I said that this is an idea of Go Seigen but he responded "You can't if there is no stone on the side hoshi point (A)."  He showed me the side variation I added but I thought it wasn't so bad for Black.

reid: Kwok's teacher is correct.  The usual prerequisite for black to drop back into the corner like this is to have the extension at K16 already in place.  Whte approaches at R14 (for example), black pincers at B, then white approaches on the other side with O17.  In this position, dropping back to R17 (denying white the corner access) leads to a fight which should be good for black.  See variation.]

(;W[pi];B[pf];W[qg];B[lc];W[nf]C[reid: I think white should not try to pull this stone out yet.  Instead, she would be better off returning to B1.  Perhaps as a result of later fighting, white will find that O17 is in a good spot for some other action.

In general, you don't want to be fighting just for the sake of fighting.  You want to fight to accomplish some strategic goal, and where you have an advantage, not where you are at a disadvantage.  The big exception to this is when you are invading a large moyo and you expect to be at a disadvantage.  That should only happen when the entire game hinges on the outcome of the invasion.

Here, if white pulls out the one stone, it doesn't do anything strategically because black is already alive on both sides.  Of course, if that changes, then pulling out O17 becomes a more attractive idea.  But it will also affect *how* white chooses to pull out the stone.]
;B[nd];W[oe];B[od];W[pe]C[I thought this exchange is very good for Black.

reid: of course.  White gained only a few points, while giving black at least 15 points (in sente) with almost no aji.]
;B[kq]
(;W[nq]C[I think this should have been from the other side - the stones on the left aren't so thick.  My plan is to attack them and the D8 stones at the same time with my corner stones while securing my group on the side.

reid: But white would love to get an effective splitting attack going.  The problem I have with white O3 is that it is not aggressive enough.  See variation]
;B[hq];W[ds]LB[em:C][en:B][fn:A]C[I think White should have jumped to A here instead.

reid: The key move for white is B1, as we have seen in many variations up to this point.  The key here is that B1 is the base for both sides.  But D1 is practically a giveaway move - white doesn't need to occupy this point (if she has B1).

How white continues depends on how black answers.    Sealing black in with B(E6) is much better than A (which leaves the hole at C).]
;B[en];W[fl]C[reid: white is a move behind here - she lost a 'tempo' with D1.]

(;B[ep]LB[go:A]TR[ho][gr]C[This was a bad move.  I think it should have been at G2 or H5 (triangled). See variations.

reid: as I mention in the second variation on the previous move, enclosing with A is better.]
;W[gr]
(;B[gq]C[reid: black "pushes into the knight's move" which is another go proverb - in this case, something we are warned against.  It tends to harden your opponent's formations.  Black would rather leave alive the aji in the variation.

Instead of this, black should enclose white with A which leaves the F8 stones floating around without much help.]
;W[fq];B[hn]LB[go:A]C[reid: black A is still better.];W[go]
;B[gn]LB[ho:B][bs:A]C[reid: since black has A (B1) available, perhaps B (H5) is a better way to play.]
;W[ho];B[in]LB[ek:A][gk:C][el:B]C[I think I put too much pressure on my lower stones.

reid: It looks to me like you have already decided to sacrifice them in exchange for the black A through C sequence]
;W[jp];B[kp]LB[jo:A]C[reid: white's obvious response to L4 is A.  I like to think of this as like squirting watermelon seeds from between your fingers, or water squirting out of a hose.  White A (K5) is terrible for black - black needs to avoid L4 at all costs!]
;W[jo];B[ir]C[This looks strange, but I wanted to keep sente while threatening the cut at J5.  All other moves (I think) are gote.]
;W[jn]C[I think this was bad as it allows me to cut her stones in sente.]
;B[io];W[ip];B[hp];W[fs]LB[aq:B][bs:A]C[Her teacher said she should have exchanged A for B before living (I agree).

reid: I also agree (but about 35 or 40 moves ago).  Also, E3 seems to be a better way to live since black can take two eyes with one move there.]

(;B[mo]LB[mp:A]C[reid: Instead of N5, black should just finish the game with the sequence in the variation.

But if black doesn't want the game to end too soon, playing A (N4) is more solid than N5.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[jl];B[hl]C[reid: white has too many irons in the fire - there is no way she can come out of this with a good result.  And it is all due to missing B1 at about move 12.]
;W[fj];B[ek];W[gm];B[fm];W[gl]
(;B[il]LB[el:A]C[reid: black A is also enough to finish the game]
;W[el];B[dh]C[I was happy to be able to play this move in sente.]
;W[hj];B[jk];W[ln];B[ko];W[kl];B[kn];W[km];B[im]C[reid: this is also aji-keshi.]
;W[jm];B[np];W[lq]C[The immediate cut doesn't work  (and I was fortunate to recognize that in the game).]
;B[oq];W[or]LB[ik:A]TR[lq][nq][lr]C[I could have captured the triangled stones here, but that gives me gote and allows her to cause big problems (and solve her own) with the cut at A.  So I chose influence and sente instead.]
;B[op];W[pr];B[qq]TR[lo][lp]C[I sacrificed a stone for influence and giving me security against the cut at M4 and M5.]

;W[cn]C[Big but gote? I don't know what is the right move for White here.]
;B[pm]TR[nm]C[I wanted to attack the triangled stones more but here I just needed to use the attack to make eyes.  My bad shape moves earlier made my bottom stones way too heavy.

I probably should have played at O7 (triangled) instead.];W[nm]

;W[mj];B[qk]C[It's big and I'm afraid of having to make my stones live, so I took it.]
;W[co];B[dp];W[dn];B[eo];W[bp];B[bq];W[bo];B[bs];W[cs];B[hi]
;W[ii];B[ih]C[I had two choices - play submissive or choose more fighting.  I should have just ataried from K11
and then connected.  White has very little territory and I would have won anyway.  I almost lost the game with this move.]
;W[ji];B[kh]LB[kj:A]TR[fj][hj][hk]C[As soon as I played this move, I thought it was a mistake because White has miai to connect after playing L10 (A).  But in fact after I examined the game, Black can capture the marked stones if White does not protect them.]
;W[kj]C[reid: see move 128 in my variation on this move for white's correct continuation.]

(;B[ki]
(;W[hh]C[I thought White should have connected at L11 (A), but there was too much aji on the left side for either of us to calculate completely, so she played safe.  Unfortunately playing safe is a loss for White at this point.  See variations I explored.

I could not find a satisfactory variation on the left side (seki is the best I can see).]
;B[jj];W[gi];B[jh];W[hi];B[kk]C[reid:  Ok, there were a number of missed opportunities in this game, and I think black was over-thinking some of the sequences.  It is very easy in this game to get caught up in a sequence that you think is likely to happen, when in fact that sequence won't work at all due to some variation you've overlooked.  So it's best to not think so far ahead, but instead, concentrate on finding the good move, the best shape, for this move (I recognize that it's easier said than done!).

There is a tendency for stronger players, particularly in the opening, to do a fair amount of hand-waving saying things like "this result is good for black", or "this influence is good for white".  What I have tried to do in this review is to show concrete sequences that demonstrate why some of those rather vague pronouncments are valid.  The thing that makes go interesting (IMO) is working one weakness against another.  If you can make a stone attack two weaknesses at once, it's almost like getting two moves.  In this game, white could have used black's weak group in the lower left to build up her F3 group.  This in turn would have lead to an attack on black's bottom group (L3) which could have let her build up a grand moyo on the right..  A single loss of 'tempo' (missing B1) was enough to prevent that from happening.

The biggest mistakes in this game occurred within the first twenty moves.  If you can understand those mistakes, you will avoid them in the future and you will gain a lot from this game.

Good luck, play strong - reid.])
