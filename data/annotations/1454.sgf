C[I play black.

I've lost this game for 8.5 points. I made some big  mistakes but also my opponent.
I thought my territory on the left was as big as my  opponent's one in the bottom right corner ; but it made  the difference.

I'd like to understand what I should have done to make  the difference

Hi!

I hope this review helps. I will try and comment on  both black and white as I find that easier so pls.  forward this review to your opponent. Be sure to check  the comments at the end of the game as that is where I  usually put advice on what to work on in your game.

Hope you enjoy!

The usual moves range from a-d. There's an  excellent article by Charles Matthews on Chinese  style opening on Mindzine  (http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/

(;B[kd]LB[kd:9][id:a][de:b][qc:c]C[Black 9 is a move that invites white to play b and  shows black is willing to let white get a small life in  the upper-left. The other way to go would be black 9  at a which makes invading at b a very difficult task  for white. Playing a means that there's less support  for black marked stone but black shouldn't worry  about that as the marked stone has the invasion at  c open anytime.  See var.]

White invasions were unreasonable although they  turned out o.k. Black should not have given up his  corner as that lead to the loosing position. I hope my  comments help as I tried to keep the variations  simple. If you liked this review then check out other  reviews I made for the GTL.
Black 89 and 111 are very serious mistakes so you  should spend some time on analyzing why you made  those choices.
White should be more careful about invading as the  result against better-prepared players might be very  different.   Goran]
