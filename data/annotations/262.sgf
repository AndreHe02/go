[qk];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[cf];W[fd]C[I would maybe prefer a pincer here, at C12 or D11.]
;B[dj];W[cm]C[I  think the two important fuseki points remaining now are K4 (or K3) and Q5.   Letting Black play around this point (C7) is probably better than letting him  make a double wing with K4 for instance.]
;B[fq]C[This is possible, if perhaps  not as common as Black C3 or D3. In this position I would prefer D3; White  has not choice but to play C3, and Black can extend towards the right.]
;W[hq]C[Now White gets the chance to play a pincer. Hard to say if this is good or  not. Simply D3 is another possibility.]
;B[dr]C[A peculiar move. C3 or D3 is  more common.];W[cq];B[fo];W[ho];B
[fm];W[kq]C[This is too short. With the  extention to H5 already in place, White should extend at least to M3. If  Black invades, fight it out!]
;B[mq]C[This is very good for Black, he is  expanding, while White looks small and over-concentrated.]
;W[lo]C[Wrong  direction I think. The White group will become a target later, but I don't  think White can afford to strengthen it this way. It's a small move in  territory, and it induces a much larger move from Black...]
;B[no]C[Black's  right side moyo is looking pretty big now.];W[bd]C[Not an urgent move, and  it's not really threatening Black. If White is to play on the left side, it  is the lower group that needs strengthening. But the big problem now is how  to keep Black's right side from growing even more.]
;B[hc];W[gc]C[After White  B16, it's easy to understand this, but it's almost never a good move,  because...]
;B[hd]C[...it only makes Black stronger, and now Black can attack  the white stones on the right. And, White hasn't really protected his  "territory" in the upper left corner. Black can peep at E17 and C17. So,  White G17 should have been H16.]
;W[pb];B[lc];W[qc];B[pc]C[This is no use, it  only strengthens White. Black could as well play R16 immediately.]
;W[oc];B[qd];W[rc];B[rd];W[ne];B[ob];W[qa];B[sc];W[sb];B[rb];W[sd];B[se]
;W[sc];B[rf]C[The  sequence starting with Black P18 only strengthens White and Black ends in  gote. Black should play K17.]
;W[ld];B[mc]C[Again, Black starts strengthening  White, instead of leaving the aji for future use...]
;W[nb];B[md];W[le];B[me];W[mf];B[nd];W[od];B[oe];W[nf];B[mb];W[oa];B[jc]
C[And now Black has to play  K17 anyway.];W[kd];B[kc];W[lh];B[ma]C[This is a ko-threat.]
;W[na];B[hf];W[oh]C[Ok move, but I think White can be even more aggressive. White Q13, Black  R13, White Q12...]
;B[ph];W[pi];B[qh];W[pj]C[I don't like this move, but can't  think of any better in this area. Maybe P9? Or play elsewhere...]
;B[og];W[nh];B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[nl];B[nm];W[om];B[pl];W[mm];B[nn];W[ml]
C[The problem  with the last few moves is that they have (almost) secured Black's right  side, and ends in gote, so...]
;B[jj]C[...Black gets the big point. Since the  upper left corner is not secured, White is behind now. He must somehow keep  Black from getting too much in the center, by playing, say E13 and in the H10  area.]
;W[bk]C[No longer an important move, Black doesn't want territory here  anyway. If White wants to strengthen this group, C2 is better.]
;B[bi];W[ep]C[A pointless peep.];B[fp];W[er]C[This doesn't do anything. Black can play  E3 if he wants to. The move in this position is C2, but there are more  important things to worry about now.]
;B[dn];W[cn];B[dm];W[fr]C[Black plays  G2, White G3, Black E3, and Black will either connect to D2 or capture the  two white stones.]
;B[kf];W[lf];B[jh]C[Black is walling off the center.];W[dl];B[el];W[ek]
;B[dk];W[cl]C[The big hole in Black's area is at E-F14.];B[fk];W[ic];B[ib]
;W[id];B[ec]C[Black is impatient? Should connect at H18.];W[hb]C[White takes advantage of Black's mistake.]
;B[gb]C[But in fact, Black can  play K18. White must play G18, and Black lives with L19.]
;W[jb];B[ha];W[kb]C[Ok, White killed 9 stones, getting some 25 points in gote.]
;B[cc]C[The  question is, who gained from this exchange? If these white stones die, and it  seems likely, Black gets more than compensated for his loss on the upper  side.]
;W[gd]C[Why this?];B[he];W[dc];B[db];W[cb];B[bb];W[eb];B[ca];W[fb];B[cd]
;W[ce]C[Mistake.];B[de];W[be]C[Another one.];B[ed];W[bj];B[ci];W[bh];B[ai]
;W[bg];B[bf];W[af];B[cg];W[ig]C[A good move, threatening to capture a fairly  large piece of the center.]
;B[if]C[If Black counts, he will discover that he  can simply discard the three center stones. Simply pushing down along the  H-line, will secure enough points to win by a wide margin.]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[hg];B[kg];W[kh];B[gg];W[ii];B[ih];W[hh];B[ji];W[hi];B[fi]
;W[hk];B[hm];W[il];B[ij];W[hj];B[ik];W[hl];B[jl];W[im];B[hn];W[in];B[io]

;W[lk];B[li];W[ki];B[kj]C[Careless by  White, but the game was lost a long time ago.]
;C[I get the feeling that White  makes some early strategic mistakes in this game, and then keeps trying to  patch things up. He also have a tendency to "securing" territory at the wrong  time, and missing the urgent moves and right direction of play. (If I knew  what to do about this, I'd be a lot stronger player myself...) White also  should try to improve his tactical reading, and avoid playing moves that  simply doesn't work.

Black played quite well, but seem to have a tendency to aji-keshi (destroying  latent possibilities).]
