C[Let me first thank you for taking the time to review this game of mine. This was a teaching game that I played. I felt really good about my play until the last move when my territory was invaded, and I failed to defend. I'm noticing that I really struggle when in a direct skirmish with the other player. All advice will be greatly appreciated.

R: Hello. I am Radu, I am around 10k on LG and DGS. I would be very happy to comment your game. I will focus on B moves, but also if important, W too.]
;B[kd];W[ck];B[jk];W[dd];B[ic];W[gk];B[jg]TR[jh]CR[ki][ji]SQ[fj]
[gj]C[R: This looks to close of the corner enclosure. B has a strong shimari in up corner, while K3 stone is under attack (not yet heavy). So: help your weakest stone and play away of the strong group.
 K6 is also a better defensive against an invasion (cercle points). And finally, regarding only the shimari in the corner, the best extension is again... K6 and not K7.
To summary: make 3 points extension from a 2 stone shimari, play away the strongest group and defend the weakest: identify the attacked stone and defend it.
Actually, W played G3 almost trying to provoke you to play correct. G3 is too far of sansan stone and also to low, should have been one of rectangle points actually.]
;W[gd]TR[cf]C[R: on bottom W is too low, on upside is to high. I would try an invasion right away.]
;B[fc]TR[gb]CR[ec]SQ[cf][df]C[R: This frame reducing move is kind of helping W to protect the left side and, by creating an opposing strong wall to lower side, makes it looking better. As reducing attack I would go with the safe triangle point, or more bold cercle one. Sansan attack looks a little too early, but for sure my first choice would still be rectangle ones.]
;W[gc]
(;B[fb]C[R: try maintain connection with your group: see variant.]
;W[gb];B[hl]TR[fb][fc]CR[cc]SQ[fg]C[R: first, try not let unfinished business, triangled stones badly require support. Even playing a 3x3 stone, and making indirect use of them, allows to rampage the left side.
I don't see a more urgent point on the table.
OTOH, the bottom side is already played low, there is no good reason to play even lower. W will be happy to block at G2 and suddenly he has half of bottom side on safe control. The actual hot spot (next to above told to use triangled sotnes) is in on left side. Even square point or around can be considered, it would have multiple roles.]
;W[gl];B[hm]C[R: this is really small, W can tenuki];W[gm]SQ[gg]
[ch][fd][cc][ji]C[R: really not important, B invasion there G1 would maks 6-8 points. How much would do any of square points? Much more]
;B[hj]C[R: this is one of the moments when a rough computation of table situation is required. And only looking at W stones being on the middle line (W has 6 x 13 + komi, B has 5 x 13), it is urgent to actually go invade. Your move protects cutting point K5 ok, but it is still too shy.]
;W[fj]CR[gi]TR[gd][fd]C[R: why W pulls back? Marked point looks better. Try be ahead of the opponent: this makes sense for both player. Multiple times in a go game there is a struggle to get ahead your opponents stones. Triangled groups are actually doing this: both are aiming to be one step forward against opponent.
But of course, the B hot spots (marked square in a previous diagram) are also W aiming, which actually are better options.]
;B[hk]C[R: redundant. What can W gain going there? 8 points by capturing H1 and H2 in gote? Far too small]
;W[de]CR[cf]C[R: yes, this is a fine move. It doesn't defend to well the left side, so I would have it played as a shimari, but the intention is correct]
;B[hg]C[R: still too close to friends. W is happy to walk on the middle line]
;W[id]CR[fg]TR[cg][cc][dg][dj][cj]C[R: this is another kind of error made because not counting. W should be well aware how far is ahead, should simply close the gates (like cercle point) and let B see a huge moyo on the left. This kind of move is not bad as taken alone, but simply is like showing off. 
Actually B can simply ignore it and go to attack by itself: triangle points.]
;B[jc];W[jd];B[je]TR[kc][ke]C[R: I am not feeling secure with this connection: W has 2 cutting points quite impressive. I would simply have connected at L9, good old fashion solid connection]
;W[he]C[R: again, safer connection would be better. Peeping at H11 and attacking at J9 are strengthen B with no costs. And the "extension" at H9 has no value if, for instance, B goes at G8]
;B[hc];W[hb]C[R: wrong];B[hd];W[ie];B[ge]C[R: hmmm, not sure this is working]
;W[gf];B[fe]
(;W[fd]C[R: cowardly];B[hf];W[ib]TR[gf]C[R: too small. Already monkey works there, go and pull out triangle stone, is might worth something. Or even better, close the gates]
;B[if];W[ff]C[R: too  late]
(;B[ed]C[R: not there!];W[ee];B[ec];W[he]
(;B[ie]C[R: why?
see variants]
(;W[ge]C[R: why? is worthless. two twin moves, both sides could have use the sente much better]
;B[kf]C[R: there is no more cut threat there. B is behind, so go on attack. As long as postponing the moment, W takes more and more chances of reinforcing.]
(;W[fa]C[R: another worthless move];B[dc];W[cc];B[ea];W[ga]
;B[cb];W[db];B[bb];W[bc];B[fi]C[R: first time B screws up his courage and boldly go there. But still I believe is a little to small and not in  the right place (W has G6 later on, after limitting B).
The fact is that W has 2 strong groups (in top and in bottom) and nothing between. B can either reduce the frame (by moves like this) or invade in the middle. I believe actually B has no choice but invade, simply because only limitting is not enough to win the game]
(;W[gi]C[R: again, W does not compute, why not simply limitting?]
;B[gj];W[ek];B[hi];W[gh];B[gg]
(;W[fh]C[R: nope, simply limit];B[ei];W[ej]
(;B[eh]C[R: wrong, W should be happy close the gates. B should have been use the dead stones, see variant]
(;W[fg];B[hh];W[jb]C[R: and W invite B block a potential monkey (8 points in this case)]
;B[kb];W[ka]
(;B[la]C[R: B had the chance to take sente];W[ja];B[lb];W[di]
TR[ci][cg]C[R: a better defence is farther from the the B stones, triangle points.]
;B[dg];W[cg]TR[ch][cf]C[R: another wrong move. There is a simple saying: don't attack in contact. Any of triangle stones would have done the job. B is still dead there.]
;B[cf];W[df]TR[ch]C[R: ooops, another wrong move. Why cross cutting when simple connection would be so stable (triangle)? Now B starts having some chances]
;B[bg]C[R: hmmm, but B insist on pointing the right move to W. Yes, W now is forced to do it. B should have been atari in the other way]
;W[ch];B[ci]
(;W[cj]C[R: what?];B[bi]
(;W[bh]C[R: what?];B[ah];W[dh];B[dj]C[R: B shouldn't have survived, this is only a gift of W. But now B won the game.]
;W[dk];B[di]
(;W[eg];B[ch]C[tobisensei [16k\]: didnt see that one
R: B was unconditionally alive after capturing the W group. So actually here B lost sente (could have invade the corner), but already the game is over. No longer needing to do it]
;W[bj];B[bf];W[be];B[af]C[R: still unnecessary moves (last 4-5 moves)]
;W[ae];B[ce];W[cd];B[aj];W[ak];B[ai];W[ab]C[R: redundant];B[ac]
;W[ad];B[id]C[R: really: why? B occupies its own territory. In a close game this could mean loosing it with 0.5 points]
;W[lj]C[R: suicidal attack, no much chances];B[ki]CR[lk][ll]
C[R: I am feeling this is the wrong direction. In corner it is the easiest to get a living group. Moreover, in top the B group is impressive, W can't damage. My defence would have been at M3 (yes in contact, but it is already very close to friendly groups) or even M2 if fearing a cross-cut.]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[kh];B[jh];W[le];B[ld]CR[lf][mg]C[R: why? What does W threat in up part? Just cutting at circle points would have been enough]
;W[lf]
(;B[ke]C[R: this is quite wrong, but still not deadly];W[kg]
C[R: oops, W fights, but still dead]
(;B[mg];W[mh];B[mf]C[R: now W lives. See how B should have defend]
;W[me];B[mg];W[li]
(;B[mj]C[R: not helping. Only thing can be done is to reduce the corner invasion]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[kk];B[kl];W[mk];B[ll];W[lk];B[ji];W[lg]C[R: another playing in own territory]

[ih][ii][ij][ik][il][im][jm][km]C[R: an intersting game because it shows you 2 different kind of problems.
1. Let's say "strategical" (on our level of course) problem. Facing huge moyos on both sides, every player needs to take several decissions: to invade or to reduce? To attack or to defend? When and how? The answer on this question comes only by evaluating global situation; if not move by move, at least sequence after sequence. If you are dreadful behind, be brave and invade as soon as possible. If you are boring ahead, just defend your frame and wait the opponent's attack. The problem where to attack or how to defend is something else. In time, some points on the table, as the ones I marked, become more or less obvious targets. And when... this is very hard to tell. Just try to estimate the value of your options (if I play there, how much worths? if I play there how much? and so on) and you'll find maybe the most valuable moves.
2. And the second problem is how to do local struggles. Both B and W managed to survives in impossible spaces just because the opponent made terrible mistakes in defence. I am sure that without 3-4 wrong moves in row, no group have managed to survive. 
But this is your beggining era. As much as you play (and read the situation) your skill will greatly improve in this area. Solving dead and life problems, tesuji problems and many others would also help you a lot. You really only need to improve your local fighting skills (reading, recognize alive and dead shapes, prepare attacks, use dead stones, let aji behind the enemy line, etc.)

I see no begginer mistakes, so I am supposing you already came a long way to here. Don't waste it, it is just a matter of time and training to improve your skills greatly. And my advice is to alternate real games with problems and books reading, are much more helpful to learn the tactics by seeing them presentes than to experiment yourself. Just for fun, try some problems on itnernet, you'll see how easy you'll discover so beautiful tactics so you'll be more and more confident

I hope my comments didn't disturb you
