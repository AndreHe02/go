C[Dear reviewer,



Thank you very much for taking the time to review my game.

I think the main reason I lost is because of an unfavourable fight I started at the left side. Suggestions on what I should have done instead are very welcome.



Also, I'm having difficulty with judging which exchanges are good for which side. It would be great if you could comment on this.]

janr: this move looks reasonable.  I give one variation]

janr: A is not joseki (there is a cutting point).  B is possible]
;W[cn];B[iq];W[qq];B[lp]LB[io:B][kq:A]C[I played this move to prevent white from exchanging A for B. I think that exchange is bad for black because it makes black overconcentrated. My opponent thought this move might be bad since its purpose is not very clear. Where do you think I should have played?

janr: White gets the majority in the corner.  I would prefer a move in the corner for black]

;W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[dm]C[Is this move too agressive, or was my follow up too heavy? I feel I should do something about the left side at this point. What do think is the correct strategy?

janr: I think this move is feasible.];W[dn];B[en]LB[fm:A][em:B]
C[should I have played more lightly at A or something like that instead?


janr: Extending (A or B) is better since the cut is very bad.]

C[I probably should have resigned the game here. I didn't really have a plan. This move was just to prevent white from getting very much territory here.

janr: the black center stones are very weak.  Maybe black should try to run.]
;W[je];B[ke];W[kf];B[lf];W[kg]C[janr: now white captures the black stones on a very large scale.]
;B[lg];W[kh]C[janr: white captured the black stones, without having to give any compensation.  The black stones on the upper side can still be cut.]
;B[fg]C[This move is probably to small considering the trouble I got in next. I'm not used to play such strong opponents and I guess I assumed without thinking that this would be sente, which seems not to be the case.]
