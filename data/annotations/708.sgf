be hard pressed just to remain alive, while at the same

Both players are pretty weak at reading life
and death, and understanding what constitutes
a credible threat, at least when it comes to reading
the exact outcome of a tactical fight.

General placement of stones and shapes is sound,
but black especially needs to consider the overall
shape of the board.  Living is not everything,
and especially in the beginning, it is important
to play moves that leave several alternative paths
to life, rather than one absolutely solid path.])
