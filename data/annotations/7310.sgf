;B[pp]C[Hello Brett, 
My name is Mark, you can see me on KGS as thanatos13 and I am around 13kyu as of this moment.

First off, proper etiquette demands that on the first move, you play on the top right corner (unless if you put it on Tengen)]
;W[cd];B[pd];W[dp];B[fq];W[fc];B[dq]C[This move looks slow. I'd prefer a double kakari at c6 or any other big move (Q10 and invade at d10) is good.]
;W[cq];B[ep];W[pj]C[I prefer d5 at this point to protect your very weak corner.]
;B[qj];W[on]C[This is really unused due to the fact that it would be bad to let black take a big corner (worth around 12-20 points times two knowing that the opponent didn't get it), which you are doing right now.

also I suggest that you don't  suddenly jump everywhere. I'd say R9 is a good way to fight.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[qn];W[om]C[you've got bigger fish to fry than that. The bottom left corner still looks bad for you, I'd say D5 again.

If you really want to protect against the cut then O7 is good. P7 is way too slow.]
;B[pi];W[oj];B[pg]C[D5 again.];W[dj];B[cp]C[This is punishment for ignoring them :(]
;W[do];B[cr];W[bq];B[er];W[bo];B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[gd];B[fb]
C[This mistake has been duly punished.];W[ic];B[jc];W[ib];B[hb]
;W[jd];B[ie];W[jb];B[kc];W[gb];B[kb];W[ha]C[Good job.];B[ke]
C[This move builds framework. I like it.];W[ja]C[What does this accomplish? It's very slow and gives you 1 point. each move is usually 2-3 points. right now, moves should be 6-7 points.

Invading at O3 is an option. So is invading at R17.];B[eb]C[this looks impossible for black.]
;W[ec];B[dc];W[dd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb];W[fa];B[ea]C[53 at b16 would make it live.]
;W[ca]C[54 at d18 is a double atari where black immediately stops.]
;B[ga];W[gc];B[ac]C[It's dead already.];W[bd];B[cb]C[dead.]
;W[da];B[ba];W[ab]C[good];B[br];W[aq]C[This accomplishes less than b4 where you don't need to worry about this till yose.]
;B[ar]C[This is aji keshi. It should have been saved as a ko threat.]
;W[eg]C[not accomplishing anything, and punishment comes.];B[bp]
;W[co]C[right];B[ap];W[ao];B[np];W[no];B[mo];W[oo];B[op];W[mp]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp];B[mn];W[mm];B[lm];W[nm]C[M6 is the most urgent move. It saves white's L4 group]
;B[ln]C[Black should not play this against strong players. These stones are floating so they could easily die.]
;W[mk];B[kq]C[slow. K3];W[ip];B[iq];W[jq];B[jr];W[jp];B[hq]
;W[gp]C[I dont like this move. a cut at h4 puts the L4 group in a bad position.]
;B[eo];W[dm];B[gn];W[gq];B[gr];W[oh]C[Urgent moves> Big moves
Big moves>small moves.
this is a small move. k6 is an urgent move];B[oi];W[ni];B[ph]
;W[ng];B[og]C[first one to take k6 or j6 wins the area.];W[jf]
C[small move];B[je];W[if];B[he];W[gf]C[the net is a killing tesuji, not a containment.  H14.]
;B[ge];W[fe]C[f14 is a better place to play.];B[hf]C[this is painful for white.]
;W[hg];B[ff]C[this is not right. (see later comments)];W[gg]
;B[ee]C[still bad];W[ef]C[a connection at f16 would immediately kill the black group.]
;B[fd];W[fg]C[unnecessary safe move. A move at D15 is much better for area protection.]
;B[de]C[This would be very bad against 15kyus. If white takes back f15, then black has a ko for life.white has a few ko threats at the bottom (at this point white's bottom group is almost dead).]
;W[df];B[ce];W[be]C[the ko at f15.
This move lets black march right into your territory.];B[cf]
;W[cg];B[bf];W[af]C[marching again.];B[ag];W[ae]C[Bad! now black has a snapback.]
;B[bg]C[E16 sets up the snapback, but black didn't see it.]
;W[ed]C[finally.];B[fe];W[bh];B[ch];W[ci];B[dg];W[dh];B[cg]
C[white is now down many points. The only thing that can even it out is both a san-san (r17) invasion at the top right and taking all of the middle. Thi only thing I see right now is a cut at f5, but now the game is really hard to play for white. The left side is not as important anymore.]
;W[ai];B[eh];W[di];B[fh];W[gh];B[ah];W[bi];B[ig];W[fi];B[gi]
;W[ei];B[hi];W[gm]C[not big enough. A win is a win. A loss is a loss. Even if someone wins by 200 points, that doesn't say anything about the difference in level.
At this stage you should attack vigorously, not protect.];B[fm]
C[better at H7.];W[hm]C[cut at F6 prepares for what could be an escape for white.]
;B[hn];W[in]C[K6 gives less room for black's M6 group and more room for you.]
;B[jm];W[kn]C[a connect at j7 looks better.];B[jn];W[ko];B[km]
;W[io];B[im];W[fn];B[fo];W[en];B[em];W[dn];B[gl];W[hl];B[hk]
;W[il];B[go];W[el];B[fk];W[fl];B[ek]
(;W[dk]SQ[hk][gl][fk][ek][gi][hi]C[it looks hard to make life with the stones marked here. White has the chance to kill those. Since white is far behind, a safe move at d9 was unreasonable.]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[nf];W[oh]C[No need to take. A connection is better.]
;B[jg];W[kf];B[kg];W[lf];B[le];W[mf];B[nh];W[mg];B[ne];W[me]
;B[md];W[ll];B[jl];W[fm]C[What was this move? It doesn't accomplish anything. That group was already safe.]
;B[ik];W[mj]C[Too safe.];B[li];W[mi];B[kk];W[qk];B[rl];W[rk]
;B[rj];W[ql];B[rm];W[qm]C[Another unnecessary safe move.];B[ri]
C[Unnecessary safe move.];W[sk];B[rn];W[po];B[qo];W[sj];B[si]
;W[sl];B[rp];W[sm];B[lh];W[gk];B[gj]C[Why are you happy with so few points?]
;W[gl];B[fj];W[ej]C[Useless move.
It completes a B2 Bomber, yay good for you, but does it work? (answer is no)]

[ok][ol][pk][pl]C[It was good. throughout the whole game white could have done r17.

What i liked was the top left corner for white and the control of the territory for black.

Have Fun playing go.
