C[J: Hello reviewer, I'd like to thank you for the service. In this game, I play as black and from the opening I felt completely dominated. I felt pretty beaten the entire game, and I feel like some spots left me extremely confused.

-H-: Hello!  Your main problem seems to be a lot of baseless anxiety.  Do not beat yourself up about all the potential bad moves you might make.  Try to remain calm.]
;B[qd];W[qo];B[dp];W[ec];B[oc];W[fq];B[cn];W[kq];B[pq];W[nq]
(;B[po]C[J: Looking back, I wish I had just simplified the situation. What would you recommend?

-H-:  I would not play this, because after the natural continuation, White's L3 just stands perfectly in Black's way.]
;W[pn];B[oo];W[qp];B[oq];W[qq]
(;B[np]C[-H-:  This just helps White.  Better hane below.]
(;W[mq]C[J: Perhaps P6 instead? After I played O4, i felt like I just helped white strengthen himself.

-H-: See variation to the previous move.  White could also descend here.]
(;B[iq]C[J: I didn't want him to comfortably play H4.

-H-:  Why not?  See variation.  Anyway, since the group on the right is not settled yet, provoking a fight can only be premature.]
;W[ko]C[J: Now I have two groups to take care of.];B[mn];W[on]
C[-H-:  I do not know what White is trying to accomplish with this move.]
;B[nn];W[pp];B[op]C[J: Heavy and nearly eyeless, I was heartbroken at seeing this shape. I almost felt like resigning then and there.

-H-:  Don't be so pessimistic.  The black group is difficult to enclose now.  You will often read things like "unbearable" and "horrible" in commentaries, but try not to think in such terms too much.  Try to assess each situation by itself.  Here, the black group may have a bit bad shape, but Black also has some territory in the bottom left and upper right, so keep your spirits up and look for the best way to continue, step by step.]
;W[ql]
(;B[mp]C[J: I feel like I should have just jumped out, but I must have been desperate for an eye, but in hindsight I believe I just unneccesarily strengthed white once again.

-H-:  If you are out, you do not need eyes.];W[lp];B[io]C[J: E3 first, maybe?

-H-:  While it would make that white stone heavy, it would also strengthen it.  With the weak black group on the right nearby, you better stay flexible.]
;W[km];B[ml];W[kk];B[mj];W[nk];B[ll];W[kl];B[lj];W[ji]
(;B[jn]C[-H-:  I do not like this peep.  If White later threatens to cut through N7, you might want to peep from the other side.]
;W[kn]
(;B[qj]C[J: I was aiming for the cut and extending from R16 at the same time. I think I should have defended lower left.

-H-:  Yes, the lower left is more urgent.];W[oi]C[J: Painful, but O9 isn't connected to R8, so there might be something I could have done here.

-H-:  What is so painful?  White just set himself up for a nasty cut.  Don't scream "painful" for every move of your opponent.  It is a two-person game, you know?]
;B[pk]C[-H-:  Difficult for White.];W[pl];B[ok];W[ol];B[nj]
C[-H-:  Now what was so painful about P11?];W[rd];B[qe];W[qc]
;B[pc];W[rj]C[J: Painful.

-H-: Why?]
(;B[qi]C[-H-: It looks difficult, but I think Black can play S11 (see variation).]
;W[ri];B[qh];W[hp]C[J: Even more painful.

-H-:  Sorry, but: "Oh my god, my opponent is playing moves too."]
;B[ip];W[gn];B[go];W[fo]

(;W[gq]C[J: I think I lucked out a little here.];B[gm];W[ho]
;B[fn];W[go];B[hm];W[en];B[fm];W[dr];B[em];W[ik]C[J: Here, I simply didn't know where to go next.

-H-:  Everything is more or less settled, so take a big point.  Approaching the upper left corner looks natural.  The board is almost empty over there.]
(;B[lr]C[-H-:  Not a good idea, I think.  Black could play L2 later, perhaps.]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[ls];B[de]
(;W[cg]
(;B[cc]C[-H-:  This is a bad move...];W[be]C[-H-:  ... because of this.  It is difficult for Black to make shape now.  See variation to the previous move.]
;B[ce]C[J: I feel like I am again strengthening white without cause; I thought F16 might be a good move, but I was afraid of potential cuts.

-H-:  The problem was the previous black move.];W[bd];B[dc]
;W[cj]
(;B[id]C[J: One of the few moves I really have few complaints about, but I feel like it could be somewhat better placed.

-H-:  Well, one place to the right might actually feel better, but this is really a minor concern.  One should also think about just securing the left group.]
;W[kh];B[ld];W[mh]
(;B[nh]C[J: I wish I had just played S12, it would have been solid and even if white ignored the threat to his two stones to the left, I feel secure.

-H-: I would not answer White at all.  Black is not in danger.]
;W[ng]C[-H-:  Can White really play this?]
(;B[oh]C[-H-:  Perhaps too easy on White.];W[lf];B[rc]C[J: Premature, but I was desperate for territory.

-H-:  Why not make territory at C3 or B17 then?  It would have the added benefit of stabilizing black groups.]
;W[hd];B[ie]C[J: I had a feeling that white wanted to build influence towards the center, so in order to prevent that...

-H-:  Black has D15 and F7 already looking into the centre, so there is not much for White to gain there.  The real threat is that the upper left black group gets weak.]
;W[fe];B[hc];W[gc]
(;B[gb]C[J: Making my top left weaker and weaker... this is obviously no good, but I was under time pressure.

-H-:  This lets White live directly.  If you want to play on this side, H18 is better.]
;W[fb];B[gd];W[fc];B[dg];W[ch];B[bc]C[-H-:  This makes only a single eye.  Better go out first.]
(;W[hb]C[-H-:  White could attack first on the left.];B[ic]
(;W[ib]C[-H-:  White should keep Black occupied on the left.  This is just endgame.]
;B[jb];W[fg];B[ia]C[J: White could have killed here. I kind of wish he did, I would have spent less time brooding about the rest of the game.]
(;W[ga];B[ed];W[fd];B[cd];W[cf];B[df]C[J: This gave me the choice to move out in center or live in corner.

-H-:  I would still just make the eye.  What is bigger, living or connecting the single stone?]
(;W[rh]C[-H-:  C3 is bigger, as it also begins to threaten the black group.]

;B[ps];W[rs];B[hg];W[qf];B[re];W[og];B[ni];W[nd]
(;B[ne]C[J: I was clearly desperate for any advantage I could fight for, but the thinness of my position should have alerted me to the danger.

-H-:  Don't be so desperate.  Do you have any estimate who is ahead here?]
;W[kc]
(;B[jc]C[-H-:  See variation.];W[kd]C[J: It would have probably been wise for me to resign at this point. After this is endgame, and while I would not mind any commentary on it (I'm sure my endgame was equally atrocious), I feel like the bulk of my mistakes were made before this point.

Thank you.

-H-: I made some comments for the endgame, too.  It would certainly help you to think about what you do in the endgame.  Endgame is the easiest part of the game, because the closer you get to the end, the better is the value of moves calculable.]

;B[cb];W[er]
(;B[aj]C[-H-: This is too far, as you will see in the following.  Keep one space closer, to A9, and you can keep sente.  Sente is essential for the monkey jump.]
;W[bk];B[ak];W[al];B[bl];W[ai];B[am];W[bj];B[al]C[-H-:  At least do not answer here.  P18 is worth much, much more.]

;W[jg];B[ig];W[ca];B[ba];W[da];B[jf]C[-H-:  Too small.  Black is alive.  P18 is bigger.]

(;B[hj]C[-H-:  Just play in the centre.  This peep is not worth much.]
;W[hk];B[jh];W[ki];B[fh];W[eh];B[fi]C[-H-:  This kind of move does not keep sente.]

Black already has some points in the upper right (count a shimari as about 20 points when it has so much space around it) and the lower left.  Now black can approach the upper left or expand on the right side.  Often, the trick is to give the opponent his territory exactly where he wants it.]
