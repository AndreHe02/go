C[Hi, we have both added our own comments to this, and would greatly apreciate any advice. ghojda plays black, mgt74 plays white. This game ends up being basically positioning for territory with no deep invasions or complicated fights, but as beginners, we are both trying to get an idea of positioning and developing advantage.      One thing I would greatly appreciate is any variations showing invasions into semi-formed territory. I have trouble sometimes determining when territory is secure, and also how to invade opponents territory that iI think is insecure.      Thanks mgt74]
;B[dq]C[Hi,    good idea to ask a lot. I앏l try my verry best to give you satisfying answers, but if you have any left after you read my comment feel free to ask me again.    I marked my comments with "M".]
;W[dd];B[co];W[jq]C[mgt74: please comment on this move. I know that corners first is typical, but I thought that since he'd already taken his shamari, I would still have an oportunity to take one of the remaining corners-- And this way I could lessen the utility of his shimari.        M: You you had a good idea, but even more important is to play first where you can get the biggest advantage from. Of course B could make a verry good extension from his shimari but then W gets the first stone in 3 corners which surely is better for W.]
;B[gq]C[mgt74: a small move for so early in the game i think.        M: Much to small, even more if you see, that W has no interest in playing there in the near future (at least until it압 clear who gets the lower right corner).]
;W[pp]C[      mgt74 24k*: hehe sorry];B[qp]C[mgt74: I'm not sure what the best reply to black R4 is, but I think it is dangerous for black. If I get sente, I can take the 3rd corner, and have a significant advantage.        M: Yes, in the upper right corner is better here, because it압 bigger.

R4 is to aggressive at this moment. Let W get this corner and take the other one, it압 not necessary to destroy all your opponents mojos as long as yours are bigger.

W now can now take most of the corner with R3 or get outside influence with R5 (would be even better if he can get the upper right corner too) .]
;W[qq];B[qo];W[po]C[The upper right corner is bigger than every of the following moves.]
;B[pn];W[on];B[rq];W[qr];B[pm]
(;W[om];B[pk]C[ghojda: this move should stop W's pushing giving me sente



M: I don앖 see how W could kill the B group with one move, so use 17 to take the upper right corner :-)

Locally 17 is a good move, but there is no threat for the life of the W group too,  W can now play elesewhere. 17 isn앖 even sente.]
;W[pc]C[M: Hooray!



Let압 have a look on the board now.

B has to quite save groups, W has one and two stones in the upper corners. B has to hurry now to play on a larger scale and get some stones and influence all over the board.



see variations]
(;B[ol]C[M: to slow

Of course the center is still open but also two of the corners which are more important in the fuseki, because you can make more and easier points there.

I would attack with C14 because this fits nicely with the strong influence in the lower left corner.]
;W[nl]C[M: see my comment on move 19];B[nk];W[ml];B[ph]C[M: still much to near to your strength, play elsewhere]
;W[qe]C[M: good];B[qf]C[M: not good, to small and even locally S13 or R13 would be better because the connection between 23 and 25 is stronger and W doesn앖 get strength on the upper edge automatically by answering now at Q15]
;W[pf]C[M: I said by answering now at Q15 :-)

but this is alright too, more ambitious but one more possible cut at Q15]

(;B[qg];W[md]TR[qf][qg][ph]C[mgt74: This was a very small extension, but I was worried about the possibility of invasion, considering the marked stones. Is that a real threat?



M: W has two stones on the Q line so the extension should be at least one, better two lines bigger here. Even without any extension W could live in the UR corner or escape into the center.



This is verry important all over the game if you have more than one possibility to prevent a group from beeing killed you can play in the part of the board where you can get the most from the next move. In this case I would like to make sure B doesn앖 get to much from is LL influence and play at D 9 or 10 for example.]
;B[ck]C[ghojda: the UR corner was now in W's hands so i thought of attacking UL corner but choosed the safer extension      M: The UR corner is W, the LL B, both can앖 be invaded now. Also the B group on the right edge.

The W group on the lower edge isn앖 that save because there is a gap into the center, 5 is strong and there are a lot of cuts in the W wall.



29 is over concentrated. B gets verry strong influence in the LL, but both 29 and 5 are on the third line what makes it difficult to make much points in the center here. In addition W now has the chance to extend at the left edge too and get strong influence on both upper sides. I would prefer to attack as shown earlier at C14 or with the strong UR corner now perhaps better at F17.]
;W[ch]C[ghojda: it was time to attack on the upper side, closer to the corner hoping W would start defending the corner



M: That압 what I meant.]
(;B[hd]C[M: The upper edge is far from beeing secure W territory, but as you have seen B has to do something to prevent this.

It압 no real invasion jet because there is much space to live. But as while invading you now have to decide which result you should get in this situation. I think first of all B should try to get a save group on the upper edge from which he can try to reduce W압 corner-territories.



If you want to live as fast as possible play / invade on the third line, if you want to reduce, get influence and run into the center, play on the 4th line !!!

see variation]
(;W[jc]SQ[fc]C[mgt74: I wasn't sure if it was better to approach from this side or from my lone stone at D16. I generally try to add stones to my weaker side, but this time I did the opposite. I was thinking If I played F17, he could still invade the corner at 3-3 (can he?) making my stones there essentially worthless. So, I pushed from my strong group instead.



M: There is more space for B on the right of him so I think to play on this side is correct. If you play F17 the corner can be invaded but W gets verry strong influence what would be a big threat for 31. If B gets the corner at the end and W the whole center, W is better of.

see variation];B[ec]C[ghojda: the safer move would hve been F17 (square) but i decided to be more aggresive



M: F17 is to narrow, you must try to get some eye-space];W[dc]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[fe];W[ef];B[ff]C[M: W gets terriotory on the left edge by pressing on the weak B group. 39 is good but B should have been aware of this when playing 31!]
;W[io]C[M: good, but perhaps even better at K5 (safer!).];B[je]
;W[fg];B[gg];W[fh];B[gh];AW[fj]MA[mk][gn][go][jh][hb]TR[fg]
[fh]C[ghojda: now he has used the same tactic to stop me pushing.      M: This is often verry good, but you must be sure to stand the answer if the opponent  plays right into the gap (but this often is not verry good)



mgt74: I am unclear whether this was the best move. It does reduce his ability to expand on the LL, and takes some pressure off of my marked stones, by making F11 less desirable for white.  
The other reason I played here was that I was worried about white playing E 10, ollowed by G5 when I defended on the UL... maybe not really the biggest concern at this point.     


M: The idea is correct, but as W is strong on the UL and the LR and W played 40, it압 diffficult for B to make much territory in the LL. And  42 and 44 are only important to put pressure on the B group on the upper side. If you think it already lives savely you can give up 42 and 44 because they are not important.



What I want to say is there are some good reasons to play here now but none of them is important enough to stop you from looking after better alternatives.

G6 can be cut of, why take this risk? N9 gives influence to the neutral center. K12 is risky too, W has the better position overall so he should play securely.  G5 is possible but a bit destructive. H18 could be a good idea because it starts the B group running into the center but there is to much space to profit from this.  
There is no really weak group on the board and the biggest potential for territory obviously is in the LL.

I think F10 is the right direction now.];B[el]C[ghojda: F8 instead of E8 would have been a better move so i considered this move right after i put the stone as a mistake



M: Could be better but that압 verry difficult and I can앖 decide it at the first look.  It압 not bad to play the saver move if youre not sure.]
;W[gi]C[M: slow, there is still H18 or even  G18 or S15 or many others]
;B[hi]C[M: B of course has to look after the life of this group but just to crawl into the center isn앖 verry effective. B can play on or near the interesting points for W too (the enemy압 key point is your own).]
;W[hj];B[ii];W[mk]C[ghojda: i decided to sacrifice O9 and give strenght from the opposite side to my stones on the left      mgt74: the following series shows how ittle this move did for me at this time. ghojda gains a lot of territory in the following moves, while I make about 4 timid moves in a row...



M: You  both are right. This is a fight between quite save groups about a small area of almost neutral points. You both should have played elsewhere. There are still some points to get in the LL and often endgame moves on the second line are big.]
;B[mi];W[nj];B[mf]C[good];W[kd]C[mgt74: necessary?? I was worried about an invasion... maybe needlessly so.



M: I see no chance to really invade here but if you don앖 strengthen this group it can be reduced much easier. Leading this is no bad idea.]
;B[ke];W[le];B[lf];W[ne]C[ghojda: now i had to invade (at least a little) and M9 seemed the safest move



M: It seems to me as if W has a small lead even if B gets all the big endgame moves, so you sure should invade. Perhaps there is a chance on C17 but it압 quite risky.

Now, after there is almost no chance for B  to connect an invasion group of the LR in the center, I don앖 see how you can realy invade there. You can try to reduce and see if the game is close enough afterwards or you try it anyway and resign if you fail.

Here I would play around H8 to threaten to make the LL big and to reduce the LR at the same time.]

C[mgt74: I let black get way too much profit from the last 10 moves. well played by ghojda.

(;B[oh];W[go]C[ghojda: from this moment on i considered the game lost so i played mostly defensive (loosing more points)

(;W[eb]SQ[hb]C[mgt74: maybe the move at H18 first, would have been better ( see variations)



M: B should get no territory on the edge if W plays there first, but B can still try an invasion on C17. I think E18 is a good compromise.]

;W[rf]MA[ia][is]C[mgt74: bad idea... gote move when there are much bigger points... If I play gote, I should kill the monkey jumps he can make at the X'es

Alternatively you can play S15.];B[rg];W[re];B[of]C[slow];W[oe]

;B[tt];W[tt];B[tt]C[Thanks for the review. Any suggestions are welcome for both black and white players.



M: Youre welcome.

Alltogether I have to say you both had some good ideas in this game but you tend to play to locally. Try to have a look at the whole board as often as possible and search for the biggest moves overall.

And try to see who is ahead and choose an apropriate strategy.



Have some more nice games!
