C[Clearly you understand the group dynamics here. Your group is weak and you need to strengthen it. This is the most important idea. Good.

But knight's moves contain an inherent weakness. The proverb says "strike at the waist of the keima".

I would prefer to have seen you play at A or B.];W[nf]

(;B[oh]C[This move puts more pressure on white but leaves a weakness on the right side. Since you have a 3 stone advantage you want to minimize defects.]
