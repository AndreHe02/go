C[Hi, dear reviewer!

This game is a humaliating game I played with my friend online on KGS.
Fryer was 1d and I 3k but he didn`t ask me for handicap, so I think it's OK to try.

It is humiliating because, until the very end of the game there was a white dragon that I thought I had killed, but it was seki. :D
I never thought I could do such a misjudgement.
However, this game was played at 2 AM, so at least I got an excuse to my friend, hahaha.

Any comment will be appreciated, and I expect many comments before move 139 (where the blunder is), and also about my opening, joseki choice, and about how to attack and defend (my opponent likes to get into my territory).

Thanks a lot.

-H-: Hello,  I am your reviewer, Svante.];B[pd];W[dq];B[pq]
;W[cd];B[qk];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]
(;W[qf]C[-H-: It is certainly right not to connect at Q6, but installing another weak group on this side doesn't look like a good idea to me.  Usually, White would just develop lightly with his lower group, e.g. with P8.]
;B[qh];W[of];B[nd]
(;W[rd]C[-H-: This is usually not good when White is already pincered at R12.  White cannot get a complete base here, but loses the chance to just invade at R17.  White should just play P12.]

(;B[qm]C[-H-:  Black should just answer in the upper right.  White can now get R17 in sente, and Black's right side is rather flat.  The two white stones also still retain aji.]

(;W[rn]C[-H-:  Premature.  White should just play R17.  Also, much too heavy.  These white stones now have no other purpose than to survive.]
;B[pm];W[pn]C[-H-:  Now White's two stones that had aji saddening Black, have become a very weak and eyeless four-stone-group saddening White.]
;B[np];W[no];B[mp];W[om];B[ol]
(;W[nm]C[-H-:  White can double hane here (see variation).]
;B[qc]C[-H-: Black is very happy.];W[nl];B[ok]
(;W[hq]C[-H-: White should first play at N14 or P12 to secure his group.]
;B[mf];W[ph];B[pi];W[oh]
(;B[mh]C[-H-: The shape move at R13 should not be missed.]
(;W[oi]
(;B[pj]C[-H-:  If Black connects at R11 instead, White will not get R13 in sente.]
;W[qg];B[ri];W[rh];B[qi];W[rc];B[ed];W[df];B[cc];W[bc];B[dc]
;W[jc]C[-H-:  This looks greedy.];B[hc];W[nb]C[-H-:  I think that this is not a good move, because of the sequence shown in the variation to the next.]

(;B[lc]C[i think this is a fault, how i should move in here?

-H-: Black should lower his expectations.  When White plunged in at K17, the top side was quite open and the shape on the right rather thin.  Black then played from the left, so he should now expect to reinforce the shape on the right in sente against the white group, and then go to C15.

I believe that the best move here would be N17 (see variation).]
;W[mc]
(;B[ld]C[-H-:  This is a situation where a little bit of reading will get you a long way.  Black cannot kill the white stones, so he should just see that he gets thick shape in sente.  Thick shape means NO CUTS.  Here, White can almost cut directly at N16, but certainly after he has M18.]

(;W[lb]C[-H-:  Black gets another chance to connect at N16.]

(;B[jd];W[ic]
(;B[hd]C[-H-:  Now it has all become very difficult for Black.  These stones are full of holes.  Black must connect at J16 here.]
;W[id];B[ie];W[md];B[je];W[ne]C[-H-:  This is very painful.  Not only has White gained a big area in the top right, the black shape is STILL full of holes.]
;B[ch]C[Because of the big loss in the upper right, I thought I had to get as much territory at the left side as possible, so I played this.

-H-:  I think this is a good try.];W[cg];B[dh];W[ff]
(;B[eg]C[-H-:  I don't see any benefit in this peep.  It just helps White.]
;W[ef]
(;B[ce]C[-H-:  Misses the point.  Black has a better move at B15.]
;W[be];B[de];W[cf];B[ln]C[I still try to get the left side.

-H-:  Then why not play on the left side?  This move seems to do only one thing: attack the white group.  The natural thing to do would be to extend to C8.]
;W[ll];B[mj]C[I just try to make N12 and N15 stronger, so that White can't get into my moyo too easily.

-H-:  What moyo?]
(;W[cl]C[-H-:  White should just play L9 or K8 (see variation).  You should not take risks when ahead.]
;B[jm]C[I think that with this, Black will get stronger.  Then I can start to attack White on the left.]
;W[jl];B[il]C[I just cut the white line to C8.];W[km];B[jk]
C[-H-:  Good move by Black.];W[kn];B[kl]
(;W[lm]C[-H-:  White should play M5 directly.];B[io]C[Now I got a strong group to start attacking the left side.]

;B[bh]C[-H-:  This exchange threatens the upper left.];W[bl]

(;B[bk]C[This is one of the sins for an igo player, anger.
I was just too angry to see White live, now I am going to die. :(]
;W[en];B[an];W[al];B[jp]C[-H-:  This group doesn't need reinforcement for now.  Black can kill the upper left.]
;W[he]C[-H-:  This cut is meaningless, especially when the group just dies.]
;B[pp]C[From this move until last move was my humiliating game. :D
I thought I killed this white group, so I let him destroy my moyo and even sacrified the left group, just to make sure this group didn`t connect to any other group.

Until he said: "That was seki..."
Me: "upss.... ^^"];W[oo]

;W[lj];B[mm];W[mi];B[nj];W[kk];B[jl];W[li];B[kj];W[lk];B[ni]
;W[nh]C[-H-:  If Black wants to kill, he has to play L5 now.  I don't think the centre holds, though (see variation).

So, just to repair the damage that allowing White into the centre caused, Black should now play K13, which seems to be sente, and finally kill the upper left.]

I lost, by more than 90 moku. :D

-H-:  The funny thing is, even if the white group were dead, White would still be ahead by a few points.

Anyway, the deciding points in this game were Black's failure to keep his stones together at the top, and then White's failure to play safely when ahead.]
