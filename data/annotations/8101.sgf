;B[dd];W[pq];B[cp];W[oc];B[qd];W[qc]C[I don't think you can play away from this contact - a single stone is much too weak.]
(;B[pf]C[
This looks superficially like "skipping lightly away" but S16
is a liability, not an asset.];W[pd];B[qe];W[rc];B[qi]C[I know this left the monkey jump available, but I thought it was more important to stake out more of the side first.

You are staking out nothing - if white makes the monkey jump you have no territory.   I believe the recommended response is S15]
;W[qn];B[fq];W[fc];B[cf];W[jd];B[dk]C[
The left side looks like pseudo-shape to me.  It looks nice,
but all of it is invadable.  This isn't necessarily bad - white is in a similar position except for the top-right corner - but you have to aim to close the gaps efficiently.]
;W[cj];B[ck];W[dj]C[
here's the opportunity to change the game - white has invaded and now has a liability.  This is the time for black to combine "filling the gaps" with forcing white to defend his stones.]
;B[lq]C[I thought this was a good move, that it put a toehold into most of the lower side, and I wasn't concerned about the hane at e9.]
;W[ek]
(;B[el]C[
This response just creates a serious weakness.  You really need to support the two stones, but this is just making them weaker, because they are now expected to help support E8]

Here we see the really awful shape.  It's alove sure,
but it's deformed.];W[bl];B[cm];W[bm];B[cn]C[At this point I was concerned about White's 3 stones including f9, but I was overall happy with the situation.  White only got a little cash, and I got a center-facing wall.

I would evaluate this much differently -- white has successfully
negated your early claim to the left side, and both of your corners
are weak.   Black's center facing wall is not a concern, it faces nothing.]
;W[em];B[dl]C[This move was a mistake.  I know that that stone is unimportant.  But I'm not sure where I should have played.

Both corners are still open  White needs to plant a little seed so his stones can eventually live.]
;W[fn];B[ip];W[ep]C[
I'm not sure what white is hoping to accomplish here, he's forcing black to secure his corner for little profit.]
;B[eq];W[dp];B[dq];W[do];B[co];W[in];B[ql];W[on];B[gd]C[From here on out, I felt more and more confused.  By now, all the sides had been pretty much played out, and I didn't know where to go next.

This line of play (next few moves for black) is terrible - you get marginal, easily erased influence toward the cener, while forcing white to take solid terrotry on the top.]
;W[gc];B[hd];W[hc];B[id];W[ic];B[ig]C[I thought that this was a decent move if not a great one, since it jumps off two walls and threatens to make a nice big eye in the center.  It didn't work, but I'm not quite sure why.

It's not that this move is bad, just that it is definitely gote, and even as gote, it's  far from the best. If you examine the potential but not 
realized territory, both of black's corners could be secured while
making threats against the white group on the left side.  White's top groups can be split.  Black's right group can be made into terrory.  The unfortunate fact at this point is that all these things are likely to end in gote.

The downside of "light" moves is that they leave many
weaknesses, and it usually takes gote moves to fix them, unless your opponent is helping out by forcing you to secure them.]

Here again, black missed an opportunity to use sente for
prodit.  White is not bothered by black's pressing of his group,
and black loses sente.];W[en];B[gn];W[gm];B[go];W[im];B[nq]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[qk]C[Is there a good response to an attack like this? I considered Q9, but I knew that the white stone would just connect to R6 anyway.]
;B[rk]C[
I don't think there is a better response.];W[qj];B[rj];W[pi]

;B[lh];W[mf];B[hk]C[This was my last attempt to keep control of what was left of the center.  Its a little too big, so White just oozes through it, and after that the game is over for sure.

It's more than a little overplay, it's huge overplay.];W[jk]

Generally speaking, black's problem is leaving local areas to seize sente just a little too soon.  There's a point where your life is safe but your territory is not - and that seems to be the point where you are leaving a local area.]
