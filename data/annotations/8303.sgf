C[Hello, my name is Michal and I play for about half a year now. I'm 9k on KGS and this is a game from there. I'm white, so please review that and mistakes of black I didn't see.

This was a close game, won by only half a point. After I've reviewed it I saw I made some big mistakes, although my opponent also made some. Well, it seems that is the nature of kyu players. :-) I'm constantly working on improving my reading skills by doing tsumego, but strategy is harder to learn. I wonder what strategic mistakes I've made during this game.

Thanks!

REVIEWER: Pete (3k AGA)

General comments:

1. White played few times in a way that helped black. Try to avoid that. It is almost always bad idea to push your opponent towards his own stones. 

2. In end-game, look for all sente moves first, only then move to smaller gote moves.

3. Don't get attached to Ko - they can be hard to give up (especially if you started one) but you always have to look at the whole board and look for larger-value points.

4. Watch your cut-points and 1st-line end-game moves. 

5. Nice fight in the center that captured 5 black stones - well done.]

(;W[rf]LB[nc:B][rf:C][qh:A][pp:D]C[I know this is kind of strange, but I like experimenting with this move, it is kind of interesting.


PETE: Sure - great thing to experiement. Just keep in mind that local experiments might prevent you from being able to execute a sound strategy. Every move counts :) For example playing at A prepares you for approaching the corner at D. Playing at B prepares you for creating a moyo at the top. Playing at C needs to have a clear stratigic (or at least tactical purpose as well). As is the stone at C should survive but what will the opponent do with the rest of the board as the stone settles?]
(;B[rg]C[PETE: black is being nice.]

PETE: don't think so.];B[re];W[rd];B[sf];W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[og]
LB[pp:A]SQ[mc][nc][md][nd]C[PETE: black is happy to build a wall facing A because it will make it harder for white to approach A. Notice that black is building a wall while white is trying to build territory-framework. That framework however can be easily reduced by black by playing in the marked area. White's shape is not meant for figting because it is too high. I can be used more effectively for territory but it will require a lot more care.]
;W[nf];B[jc];W[lc]SQ[pd][rd][qe][nf][of][pf]C[PETE: Yes, I think this is the right direction. The marked white stones are aligned for making territory more than creating thickness .. so you don't want to push your opponent in that direction.]
(;B[gc]LB[fc:A]C[PETE: Black could have also played at A.]
(;W[cf]LB[nc:B][le:A][cf:C]C[PETE: just to be clear, unless you have a move at A, invasion at B might still be possible. Black could also play at A later on to try to reduce white. This of course does not mean white has to protect this area just yet. It is too small. There are many other big points. Just something to keep in mind.

Also, move at C is slow. White should instead put some pressure on the two black stones while securing some corner territory.]
;B[db]
(;W[cc];B[cb]LB[ck:B][co:A]C[This move seems small at this point. Is that correct?

;B[jq]LB[hp:B][hq:A]SQ[dp][fp][dq]C[PETE: black's shape is bad. Marked stones are over-concentrated and there is still a lot of AJI around A & B.]
(;W[dn]C[In retrospect I don't think that move was necessary. I probably should have played something like C8 or C9. Or is there a bigger move on the board and I should tenuki?


PETE: yes, this is a bit slow.];B[cj];W[cl]LB[eo:A][hq:B]TR[bd]
[cd][be][ce][bf][eq][fq][gq][iq][er][fr][gr][hr][ir]C[OK, so fuseki ends here and a fight begins. Black has a lot of influence in the lower right part of the board, but not much solid territory there. He has some territory on the top and a weak group at the left. Now white has some territory at the upper right, some at the upper left and on lower left, but no framework at all. Is that assessment correct? Who is standing better? if there is inequality, which moves were mistakes?

PETE: correct for the most part except that white does not have much territory on left-top-side. Black might end up with more territory around the marked stones than white will have from the left-top side. earlier move at A would give white more territory and also make the invasion at B more effective.]
;B[cg]
(;W[dg]SQ[cb][db][gc][jc]C[In this situation is the outside hane good? Or is hane below (B13) better? Or even something else, like nobi? What is the usual way to attack those tsuke extensions?

PETE: Well, you have to ask yourself this question: how can you use the outside influence at this point? The marked black stones are now very safe. So you can't fight them. It will be hard to make territory with influence coming from the 4 white stones.]

PETE: only pros know the best moves. However, I would probably first attempt to force black to defend the base by playing at A.]

(;W[fg]C[Strategically I saw that black's lower right is a big moyo, but I've decided not to invade, but chase a weak group instead and reduce the moyo that way. Was that decision good? Was the execution good as well or are there bigger moves I could have made?

PETE: yes, BUT ... reason why you should play here is also that white group at the top-left is still not safe yet! See variation.]
;B[fh];W[gg]LB[gd:A]C[PETE: yes, correct.  But you should have played move at A earlier.]
;B[je];W[ng]LB[pn:A]C[PETE: this just helps black. You should probably approach at A instead.]
;B[oi];W[ih]C[PETE: this move just tells black: 'go ahead and run towards your other group'. But at the same time it does not gain white anything....this move turned into dame (since both black and white players have access to this area from like 4 sides.]
;B[hj];W[jj]C[PETE: This is an overlay but also continues to help black by pushing him towards his stones.]

;W[fn];B[ho]TR[eq][fq][gq][hq][iq][er][fr][gr][hr][ir]C[PETE: White encouraged black to kill 2 birds with one stone: 1) connect  2) make marked territory]
