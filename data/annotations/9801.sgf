C[Hi, this is Joonas, Finnish EGF 1 kyu doing the review. I hope my comments and review are useful. If you have additional questions, don't hesitate to ask (jokkebk@iki.fi)!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[ec];W[cj]C[Nice to get this instead of black!]
;B[jq];W[gq];B[mq];W[oq]C[Also feels good for white.];B[bp]

(;W[cq];B[bq];W[br];B[cn]
(;W[cg]LB[cl:A]C[Q: is this slack?
A: Does not seem like a losing move at least, black corner enclosure is quite inefficient and his new group weak. However, C8 might be a more active attack on black group (see added variation and my comments in your variations)]
;B[qj]LB[cl:A]C[I'd continue at A]
(;W[dl]LB[bl:A]C[I would play 1 line lower so black does not get the slide at A as easily.]
;B[en]
(;W[go]C[Good move!];B[fp]LB[fq:A]C[Natural response feels to be F3, see variation]

(;W[fo]C[This feels strange.];B[gp]
(;W[ep]C[Ouch!]
(;B[hp]
(;W[fl]LB[eo:A][fq:B]C[Wrong direction. Definitely either A or B -- connect your stones or make base and maybe attack after that]
;B[eo]C[Now it looks quite hard for white -- black F3 threatens to kill.]
;W[fq]C[Important!];B[cp]C[good shape];W[dr]C[Good shape as well. At least white bottom is now secure. But point-wise, white has three small groups and black has all the potential on the top.]
;B[bl]LB[gm:A]C[Another tempting alternative would've been to get out with black stones, with A or similar. But this is a solid way to play and probably the best move.]

(;W[cm]C[Q: this is overplay then. His shape is already too strong for such an attack

A: Yes, this does not do much anything.];B[bm];W[dn];B[do];W[dm]
;B[jc]C[Black is now in clear lead, With double wing formation, R17 is the usual invasion now.]

(;W[bn]C[Q: overcommiting....
A: well this is like 0pts sente, so once you see it doesn't work you can just move on :)]
;B[co];W[ao];B[bj];W[bi];B[aj]C[Black plays quite strong moves, but hard to live locally without a ko.]

;B[dk];W[ek];B[dj];W[fi]LB[fm:A]C[Another possible variation for black at A]

(;B[gn]C[this move was so good!

So my attack was a mistake!

Joonas: Yes, it feels now that black essentially lives with points, the bottom left that was white potential is half black, and top right is still fully in black's control.]

(;W[fn];B[fm]
(;W[el];B[ho];W[ei]C[This is a painful but necessary move, otherwise white will be ripped to pieces.]
;B[qg]C[However, after this it looks like it is impossible for white to catch up. So maybe prepare to sacrifice E8 stones and play R17 or similar instead.]

;B[jj];W[mm];B[mi];W[li];B[lj]
(;W[lh]C[Q: seems like this was correct
A: Yeah looks like black will be hard pressed to capture these three -- you can always give him N10 stone]
;B[mk]
(;W[ih]C[White is safe];B[ii];W[hh];B[df];W[eg]C[Good shape. Major problem is that black is still leading by about 20 pts.]

B+42];AW[bh][di]AB[bf][bg][ah][ai]C[Even so black wins by a lot!!!

this is a ridiculous edit where I got both the correct move around D11 and the endgame move I played instead of it. Still: B+25!

This is an extremely large loss, whereas my last games before this were all going well and even the losses where very close. So what went so massively wrong here?

Joonas: I think the game went quite evenly until white tried to kill B6 and instead cut himself into three pieces in gote. Black got an additional move on the top afterwards and after that the game progressed quite evenly (with obviously white missing the key connection later on). I do get the feeling from black moves that he/she played above her rank in this one, more like 4-5 kyu game in my opinion.

I think for white the main learning would be to leave some areas more open for later development -- just make exchanges that you know are good for you, and move on to another area of board -- that way you are not as heavily invested in case the big fight blows up. In this game, if white would've had stones in center already before attempting to kill B6 group, that would've made a big difference. So see the fuseki comments and consider where you could improve your position lightly and then proceed to another area.

Hopefully the review proves useful! I wish you good moves in your future games. :)
