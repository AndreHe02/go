AB[pd][dp]C[My notes are marked with "kb".

This game isn't my best form as I haven't really played over the board in any reasonable setting at a long time.  Forgive me, I certainly have gotten worse than my supposed rank.

FM: hello, my name is Martin and my comments will begin with "FM" because my nick is Field Mouse]
;W[qp];B[op];W[lp];B[qo];W[po];B[pp];W[qn];B[ro];W[qq];B[rn]

(;W[pn]LB[oo:A]C[[kb\]: This was a poor move on my part, wrong direction and not joseki.


FM: yes. I do not know this joseki but josekipedia says that white should continue at A]
;B[qm];W[no];B[oo]C[[kb\]: Bad exchange for Black.

FM: yes, this move makes sense only when black wants to cut]
;W[on];B[pr];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[os]
(;B[nq]C[[kb\]: My opponent hallucinated that the stone tower works, and let me live.


FM: actually I think that it worked :-)];W[qr];B[mo]LB[pl:B]
[nn:A]C[FM: Why black did not cut at A? The only answer is because black did not like the result after white would play B. Black considered the exchange A-B good for white. So pushing black into the A-B exchange is good for white and black will probably not be willing to make that exchange]

(;W[nn]TR[mo]C[FM: that is the reason why connecting here is too mild. Note that I did not need to read much, I can just say from the marked stone.]
;B[mp]
(;W[rp]LB[rl:A]C[[kb\]: I would very much like to attack these Black stones, but S8 sente is quite annoying combined with a descent at Q1, so I just fix it.

FM: this is too simple. White should think about upgrading this result. Also note that black can play A easily now and the outcome will be the same as if white played elsewhere, then black A and then white here.]

(;B[pl]LB[pk:A][ql:B]C[[kb\]: This shape is questionable.

FM: if A does not work well then it is hard for black to find a good shape here. I think this is good in this situation. B would be also possible]
;W[nl]
(;B[lq]
(;W[pi]LB[rl:A]C[[kb\]: Not sure of the best plan here.

;B[qj];W[rl]
(;B[ol]C[FM: black missed a chance to win easily];W[rj]C[[kb\]: Poor move, much better directly at S7.


FM: yes];B[qi];W[rm];B[ri]LB[qg:A]C[[kb\]: Slow....


FM: yes. Also locally black might want to play at A to remove some aji in the are.]
;W[ec];B[cd]LB[nc:A][cn:B]C[[kb\]: Questionable direction as Black is thick on both sides.  Letting White gain influence here seems a strategic directional mistake.

FM: I agree, for black I would prefer playing at A and if white made shimari in the upper left corner then play at B.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[df];B[cg];W[kc];B[mc]LB[nc:A]C[FM: just A is better]
;W[ke]TR[mc]C[FM: the hole in blacks position in the upper right is now too big. If black does not have any invasion plans into whites position or does not want to add one more stone in the upper right position then the marked stone is too far]

(;B[ip]C[[kb\]: Overconcentrated.


FM: yes, too close to blacks strong group];W[cn]
(;B[dl];W[cq]C[FM: this is super painful for black];B[dq];W[cp]
;B[do];W[cr]TR[mc][cd][dl][ip]C[[kb\]: At the time, I thought this move is effective because I want to leave bad aji at the top left and with a possibly misplaced stone at D8.  Now, I think this descent erases potential.


FM: black sacrificed a lot of points in the corner to buils a moyo, but because of white strong shape in the center black is very inefficient here. Note that the last four decisions black made were srategic mistakes, which is very painful. I would suggest for black to go back before C16 was played and try to play out some other scenarios to see the difference!]
;B[dr];W[dn];B[en];W[em];B[co]C[[kb\]: I thought about an exchange.  Obviously Black cannot accept both the descent at C2 and answering at E5, so Black will descend.]

(;W[bo];B[dm];W[bm];B[fn];W[ci]LB[cc:A]C[FM: this side is not so big. I would prefer to go directly at A.]

(;B[ch]LB[bf:B][cf:A][bg:C]C[FM: this move is bad as it does not actually protect the ABC cut]

(;W[di]
(;B[fk]LB[bi:A]C[FM: this is generally not very important area. The moyo does not have big value and if white wanted to capture the two black stones black would probably get A in sente soon and protect the aji of the upper left group which is big too.]

(;W[cb]C[FM: this move is probably too optimistic]
(;B[bi];W[bc];B[bj]TR[cb][bc]C[[kb\]: This exchange was favorable to White...

FM: very, not only it was big but it was also sente]
(;W[qc]C[[kb\]: but I think this move is too early.  I am not sure of the proper move to play on the left side, but my feeling is that there needs to be a move to fix White's thinness and also force Black to run out.

FM: this is big and black does not have any really good move on the left]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[rd];B[re];W[qe]TR[mc]C[FM: white has mistaken this situation with the joseki where there is no marked move]

(;B[od]C[FM: poor choice];W[rf]C[[kb\]: I thought the outside is better here, since Black doesn't have enough time to spend one more honte move.]
;B[rc];W[se];B[rb];W[pg]
(;B[fi]LB[dg:A][ck:B]C[[kb\]: A little too passive for me.

FM: yes. As white has still A or B this move is not so big. The right side is more urgent.]
;W[io]C[FM: courageous move]
(;B[hp]
(;W[lj]C[FM: white is trying too much here]
(;B[qg]C[FM: very bad move];W[qf];B[rg];W[of]C[FM: black did not get a single eye and white got strenghtened. This black exchange would be good only if black wanted to kill the white group, but that is impossible]
;B[mh];W[li]TR[lj]C[[kb\]: During the game, I read out possibly a seki here which is good for me, but now I think I'm a liberty behind, so this is a mistake (White has to jump out and accept Black M11).

FM: if white has to accept black M11 then the marked stone was wrong]
;B[mf]
(;W[me]
(;B[nf];W[ng];B[nh]TR[me][nf]C[FM: the marked exchange damaged white a bit]

TR[kl]SQ[ec]C[[kb\]: End of record.

John and I discussed Black's continuations in the center.  It seems likely that White can find sabaki to take away most of it, but if Black has a good plan, I would like to see it.  John said he would begin with L8 (marked).

Thank you!


FM: black has some serious problems now so I think defending the centre is not possible right now

FM: Thanks for attention. I think it is nearly impossible to comment a handicap game from the whites point of view as white always tries to push a bit harder than it would be possible in a normal game - and because white is behind this strategy is actually okay. Still I think that moves like ABCD could be upgraded. Black made a lot more strategic mistakes (or at least mistakes that did not work well in the end) after white played the square marked stone. I would suggest black to go back to that point and try to find better variations.]
