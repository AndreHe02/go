(;B[db]LB[cb:A]C[dada: I think it's better to play at 'A' (c18) see variation.]
;W[cb];B[fe];W[ed];B[fd];W[dg];B[pb]LB[jd:A]C[dada: I think 'A' (k16) is more urgent.]
;W[qg];B[rf];W[ph]TR[pb]C[dada: This is extremly good for W - B is shut in the corner. Another reason why the marked stone is bad.]
;B[pe];W[of];B[nb];W[mb];B[oc];W[mc]C[sigue: h14 lacks direction.  what is black trying to do?  see variation.]

(;B[hf];W[ld];B[id];W[jd];B[hc];W[ie];B[he];W[hd];B[gd]LB[hb:A]
C[dada: small and not urgent - if you play a local move you should consider A ('h18) instead.]
;W[hb]C[dada: W takes away B's base - now the group is without eyes and weak. The group will have to run out into the center and while doing so, W will secure a huge territory on the left side.]
;B[id];W[jb];B[if];W[je];B[gb];W[oi]C[sigue: p11 very big];B[dj]
C[sigue: d10 a bit aimless.  doesn't have a really good followup move, but it is certainly a big reducing move.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[ci];B[fj]C[sigue: f10 too nervous.  c10 better.]
;W[cj];B[fg];W[kg]C[sigue: s13 better at s12
sigue: but start with d9 instead.
sigue: b still needs a move to protect the bottom.  somewhere around k3.  gote of course.]

(;B[rg];W[rh];B[nn];W[kp];B[kq]LB[kn:A]C[dada: this seems too passive. Doing a rough count:
W has about 10+ points on the top, 25 pts on the right, 40- points on the left plus 5 pts komi making a total of about 80 points.
B has 5 points on the top, 15+ pts in the top right corner. Let's assume you keep all your territory on the bottom which would be about 25+ points making a total of 45+ points.
That is W has a lead of 35 points! So if you play like this you're going to lose for sure.
In such a case you should try to capture the W stone with a move around the 'A' (l6) area. If you succeed you make the game close. If you fail you can resign without regret.]

Of course, B can't cut at 'B' (n15), but this isn't as big as it may look. W still has the opportunity to invade at the 3,3 point 'C' (r17).]

C[dada: That's why I think this pincer isn't that good. B should consider the 2-space high pincer at 'A' (l16) instead.
I know it's hard to see the big picture (and I often fail too :o), but at least you've to try.]
