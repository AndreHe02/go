C[Hi Avi,

My name is Frank.  My comments are labeled [F\]:

I think overall, the main thing you can work on is to look for bigger moves first before following your opponent.  It seems you tried to follow him around too much which caused you to play some small moves.  I hope this helps!

Frank



Dear Reviewer,
I am abennun (Avi), playing Black in this game and lost.

I dropped recently from 3K, and I need your help to put me 'back on track'.

You will see my questions inside - but you are welcome to comment on anything you feel.

I mostly like comments that will help me in future games, like "Never do this" or "In such situation you must do this".

Thanks, Avi];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[nq];B[pn];W[jp]
;B[de];W[fd];B[cj]C[[F\]: Of course you can play c15 to do the normal joseki, but splitting is not a bad idea.  The difficulty would be to find the right spot.  Your move is not bad, but I think you could have followed it up a little better.  See variation from move 13.


A: This looked to me a bit too far from D15, so I decided to try and take advantage by splitting the two stones.]

(;W[dh];B[fe]
(;W[gd];B[ge]C[A: Here I was afraid to push again at H16, because of Black E11. This is fact made me think again of D12 was correct in the first place.]
;W[ei]C[[F\]: This is a strange move for W.  It forces B to settle the c10 stone and doesnt really attack the top f15 stones.]

(;B[hd];W[ed]C[[F\]: I think the problem here was E11.  That move did not do anything to help.  It is difficult for W here.  B should play F13 here.

A: Is this play good? I am no so sure...]
(;B[ee];W[hc];B[ic]C[[F\]: Maybe you should just leave the area.]

(;W[id]C[A: I spent a lot of time before making this play, thinking that I can get along with the cut - but I was wrong.]
;B[he];W[jc];B[ib];W[jb];B[hb];W[gc];B[jd];W[ie];B[kd]C[A: Quite a disaster...Now I realized that Black has miai of J14 and L17.]
;W[gb];B[kb]C[A: Oops! Black mistake.. Should of course capture J15 in a ladder.]
;W[ha];B[kc];W[ia];B[gi];W[dk]C[[F\]: If I were B, I would play 3-3 first.

A: This looks to me like to only direction.]

;B[bo];W[do]C[A: Any comment on this sequence? I think hat cannot complain for getting central thickness although Black got some points on the left.]
;B[bh]C[[F\]: B is alive - stop following him.  Play something big like 3-3.]

(;W[cg]C[[F\]: Unnecessary.  Do you really think you can kill that group?

A: This was to prevent linking with F15 group.];B[gp]C[[F\]: I think so too.

A: It felt too deep to me.];W[ho];B[go];W[hn];B[gn];W[gm];B[fm]

;W[fo];B[ip];W[io];B[jo];W[lq];B[ko];W[kl]C[A: I was satisfied with capturing. Also Black centered is unsetlled.]
;B[qe]C[A: This play looked strange to me; I thought may be it a ladder breaker or somthing. Only later I realized Black is building a huge moyo.]
;W[no]C[A: Intended to capture the two balck stones on wide scale, also threaten invasion on the lower right corner.]
;B[nm];W[mn];B[mm];W[ln];B[qh]C[A: Now I begin to understand... So I have to reduce Black's space - but apparently I have picked to wrong side.]

(;W[qq]C[[F\]: This is not a good place to start.....];B[pq]
;W[rp];B[qo];W[pr]C[[F\] B should tenuki here to play something bigger.]

;B[lk];W[kk];B[kj];W[jj];B[ki];W[ji];B[kh];W[ig]C[A: Black secured huge territory - almost 100 points. The only I hope was to capture Black's stones in the center. Your comments on the race here are most welcome.]
