RE[W+1.5]

C[Dear reviewer,

In this game I had white and I won by 1.5 points. Komi was 6.5.

In this game, I felt I mostly defended and managed to keep a sufficient lead thanks to the 6.5 komi. I do not know how I could have won if the komi was of 4.5  for example.

I am looking for new perspectives or ideas from a stronger player to see how I could have won the game if the komi was 4.5 or lower.

I feel this would help me improve and get to the next level.

Thank you,

Philippe


Hi, my name is Fernando Grant, from now kokorini, I will try to help you.
I think 9x9 games are some how more sensitive to little misstakes so... may be difficult.]
;B[gd];W[dc];B[cf];W[fg];B[cd];W[cc]MA[fg][gg]LB[fc:A]C[I realise this move is somewhat submissive, but I felt it would help me make a base and that with the 6.5 komi I could probably manage a tight win.

I also considered playing A, but I wanted to avoid being too imitative.

Therefore this move seemed like the best, although it does lack some ambition.

Any suggestions are most welcome.



Kokorini: I think it is ok. The move at A doesn�t seems ok becouse you will force black to make a nice move to the top right corner, in the 3-3, move that you will have to answer.

This one looks fine for me.


Prehaps, What I don�t like is the white stone on the botton. I think it will be better just in the 3-3 because black stone  is in the 3rd line on the right side and you don�t have the initiative from the beginning in a very short game.]
;B[fc];W[dh]LB[bc:A]C[I wanted to take the initiative and staked the game on being able to live in the upper left later in the game.


Kokorini:
Well... I think here must be much MUCH better to play a A. Black will be forced to answer that and will give you sente endgame moves.
Also, your corner will be secure.

Probably this simple move should make the diference for the rest of the game and to win even without the komi.]
;B[ch]LB[eb:A][bc:B]C[Kokorini: Black should presure white top left corner.
Both, A and B are sente for black now.];W[dg];B[cg];W[hf]C[I felt that if I managed to live in the upper left then white would win.


Kokorini: Even now you can play that move I told before and after that this one.]
;B[bd];W[eb]LB[bc:A]C[I hesitated a lot on this move.

Looking back playing at A was maybe slightly better.

In my view, the game is now very tight and probably hangs by 0.5 point.]

(;B[fb]C[Not sure this black's best reply?

I have tried some variations... I think this is Ok for black because he has the sente on the left border.]
;W[bc];B[gf];W[gg];B[he]C[Kokorini: you can play hane on the left I think and probably on the top before anwser this one]

(;W[hg];B[ec];W[da]LB[ac:D][cb:C][fa:B][ea:A]C[Instead, maybe playing the sequence White A, Black B  and White C would be better for white since black D would be gote?

Kokorini: Yes. I think you are right about that... but you have to be sure about your eyes!]
;B[ac];W[ab];B[ad];W[ba];B[di];W[ei];B[ci];W[fh]C[These last two double sente sequences were painful for white.

I felt I had no choice and that I could probably manage to win by 0.5 point at this stage.

I wonder if I could have done better and won by a larger margin by playing differently.


Kokorni: yes... by doing the mentioned things :P !];B[df];W[ff]
C[Time to regain the initiative for white, if I am to have a chance of winning.]
;B[ge];W[fa];B[ga];W[ea];B[hb];W[ef]C[I evaluated that white should win by 1.5 points.

This proved to be the case after a total of 47 moves.

I think the key of this game was the move at A. Playing this one on the proper moment should drive you to a bigger margin.]
