C[Hi reviewer,

This was a slow game between myself and a Japanese player.  I thought I was doing well until Black solidified the group that I planned on attacking.  Afterwards I took as much profit as I could, and tried to make it a territory contest but still lost by 8.5 points.

This game was fun but difficult for me to always find the right move.

Thanks,

Kyle Blocher

[EV\] This is your reviewer Eric Vella.  My comments will be marked this way.  This was a good game, no huge mistakes, and close until the end.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[od]C[I had just read The Direction of Play by Kajiwara Takeo - he pointed out he liked to approach like this right away, since it works well with the star point to the left.]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[pe];W[md];B[nf];W[mf];B[mg];W[ng];B[of];W[lf]
;B[nh];W[qj]C[I guess this is something of a trick play.  Should be at M13 but I wanted the ability to make a group inside of Black's moyo if necessary.

[EV\] M13 is the correct move -- vital point for expansion, sente for both sides -- but experimentation is fine.]
;B[og];W[qn]C[[EV\] This is asking B to invade, starting a fight where you are outnumbered.  Why not just make a base at R7?]
;B[ql];W[on];B[ol];W[np];B[nq];W[mq];B[oq];W[mp];B[rp]C[I guess I can claim a little bit of overconcentration of Black's stones on the right side...?

[EV\] Maybe a little, considering R10 still has a lot of aji, particularly the attachment underneath at S8.  On the other hand, W also has a serious weakness, the cut at P5.]
;W[dp]C[Should I have extended to J4 here and let Black have the last corner?

[EV\] Yes, J4 or J3 would be more solid, particularly considering the possible cut at P5.]
;B[jq]C[[EV\] The high move at K4 looks like a better attack, making it a bit harder for W to move out.]
;W[hq];B[jo];W[nl]C[a little bit of light play to give me the ability to attack the stones in the middle

[EV\] Leaning against a strong group to settle a weak group is good strategy.  You could also just run out with something like N7, keeping your options in reserve.]
;B[nk]
(;W[ok]C[[EV\] This looks like an overplay.  See variation.]
;B[pk];W[mk];B[oj];W[km]C[[EV\] This result is probably acceptable, since O8 and N9 do help W settle his outside group, but I would be unhappy at having given B so much thickness and territory.  I don't think W got enough from the aji of R10.]
;B[jm]C[[EV\] B has an interesting decision here: play against the center W group, with an eye to later invading at F3, or play against the bottom W group, with an eye to attacking the W center.  I am not sure which is better.]
;W[kn]C[[EV\] Strengthening B like this is a little dissatisfying for W.  The first move to consider is hane at K8, but it looks like W gets into trouble if B responds at L6.  So maybe this move is unavoidable.]
;B[jn];W[jl];B[il];W[jk];B[hm]C[I helped Black's shape out too much...?

[EV\] No, this seems like a reasonable result for both.  But you are correct that the B group is no longer weak.]
;W[ho]C[Definitely should be at G10 or L12.

[EV\]  No, I think W does have to defend here.  There is no way for W to enclose a large moyo at the top with one more move.  As you point out, W needs at least H10 and L12 on the outside, and even then B has plenty of room to live around J17.  On the other hand, the lower B group is now quite strong, so a B invasion at F3 is an immediate threat.  I prefer a passive defence at F4 for W, making  solid territory with less aji.  H5 would be good if the B group was weak enough for W to make territory while attacking, but I don't think that is the case here.]
;B[hj]LB[fc:B][cf:A][cn:C][cq:D][dq:E]C[[EV\] Good patient move, excellent shape.  I think B could also consider this group already strong enough, and switch to one of the marked large points, but I like this move.]
;W[lg]C[[EV\] This move does very little to expand W territory, given the B stone at H10,  and B should ignore it.  The lower center W group is already safe, but if W is really worried about it, O7 is a better defensive move, making a nice territory, probably reverse sente.]

;B[dc];W[hh]C[I thought this was a no-brainer at the time - close off the moyo - but then again... Black's next moves were very good for solidifying his own territory.  My timidity here cost me the game, I think.

[EV\] This move looks good.  It does not close off the moyo, but a B move here would destroy a lot of W territory.  B can still reduce in lots of ways, since many moves around E14 are sente.  On the other hand, it is probably impossible for W to secure all the bottom territory from A3 to G3 with one more more, so a play there is not so attractive.]
;B[ep]C[[EV\] Interesting idea.  My first thought for B would be to take or contest the corner with C3 or C4, but then the B center might become weak.  I think this move is good.]
;W[eq];B[fq]C[Good move.  I was stuck for a reply.];W[fp];B[eo]

(;W[dq]C[[EV\] W should also consider descending to E2, to maintain connection with the other stones (see variation).  This way does keep a larger corner.]

;B[hp];W[fr];B[hq]
(;W[pc]C[I thought this was the biggest move, but what about F10 or C9?

[EV\] F11 is quite possible, leading to an early yose -- see variation.  The score looks close this way.  C9 is a move to try if you think you are behind, or you are a pro who can read that b incursions around F12 do not work.]
;B[ci];W[ch];B[cj];W[cg]C[[EV\] D12 would be more solid.  I don't think W could cut off a B invasion around F12 here.  I provided a few variations.]

;B[rl];W[sl];B[sk];W[sm];B[rk];W[rc]C[[EV\] This is an overplay, as you found out.  R17 is around 8 points better.]

;B[qq]C[I thought the endgame went well up to now, but now I think I've lost the game anyway.]
;W[kj];B[nm]C[[EV\] O7 is bigger than L11, so b gained points and sente here.]
;W[nn];B[ml];W[lo];B[fa];W[ga];B[ea];W[gb];B[ed];W[ee];B[dh]
C[[EV\] This has been the largest move for a long time.  Capturing here is worth around 10 pts gote for B, but if W plays first D10 (not D12) gains these points and leaves a cut worth another 10 points or more, so it is probably sente.  Missing this move was expensive.  No further comments.]
