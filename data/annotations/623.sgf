;B[pd]C[Dear Reviewer,

   White seems to want everything.  He is buzzing around like a swarm of
bees - simply doing too much.  I knew his moves had to be unsound.
However, I got flustered and either played badly or didn't know how to
respond.  Please clear the air a bit.

Thank you, redeye];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[pj];B[dj];W[dg]

;B[cq];W[am];B[bg]LB[nq:A][kp:B][jp:C]C[Very slow. Because of Whites error on the left you have to use the thickness by playing a move like A, B or C. Then your lead is already huge.]
;W[bi]C[This is even worse];B[gf]LB[jp:A]C[Black should not be in a hurry to attack this White group, because there is no obvious way to profit from an attack.
The bottom side is urgent now because a move at 'A' from White neutralizes the Black thickness and also make a big White moyo on the right side.]
;W[fc]C[My 35 @ a is just awful... How about 35 @
H17   ??

MP: That must be much better];B[ec];W[hc]LB[kc:A]C[Still this white move is bad - A look better.]
;B[jc]C[Now white is even more heavy.];W[id];B[jd];W[hf];B[he]
LB[gg:A]C[This is too complicated. If Black simply plays at A, then White has to worry about two weak groups.]
;W[ie];B[ge]C[Again, my 43 @ "a" seems awful.. play atari @ H13
??

MP: It was 41 which was the bad move. Now there is no good move for black, only painful choices.]
;W[hg];B[kf]LB[gg:A][gh:B][hh:C]C[Black must cut immediately. Otherwise White will connect two weak groups.]
;W[nd]LB[je:A][ke:B][kd:C][ld:D][kc:E][kb:F][lc:G][mc:H][lb:I]
[mb:J]C[White seems to have decided to play as many unreasonable moves as possible. The Black stones are not threatned because the ladder works for black despite White 46.]
;B[ld]LB[pf:A]C[Black should calmly extend to 'A' I think.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[qg];B[ng]
LB[gg:A]C[Black should at least consider playing 'A', but capturing White looks safe and sound.]
;W[mf]C[White risk making Black even thicker];B[rd]LB[mg:A]
C[I cannot see any reason for trying to force here. Black should just answer White and be happy because this would be a loss for White.]
;W[rc];B[rf];W[sd];B[ne]LB[mg:A]C[Still A is better. It captures both White stones and make black stronger. Black is playing too difficult unnecessarily.]
;W[jp]C[This is a good move];B[fp]LB[hp:A][hq:B]C[This is close to playing inside your own territory. Locally you have to play at 'A' or 'B'. The difference in territory is 20 points. This is the worst move in the game.]
;W[gq]C[Very observant by White. Black's impressive wall is reduced to nothing while White expands himself on a massive scale.]
;B[fq];W[em]C[Overplay];B[fm]LB[fl:A]C[Here 'A' is the tesuji. The White stone cannot escape (please confirm this yourself) and it protects the connection to the four black stones just above.]
;W[ek];B[fl];W[fk];B[fj]LB[gg:A]C[The Black stones are very heavy. Perhaps Black should take the opportunity to push through and cut at 'A' instead.]
;W[gk];B[gj];W[hj]C[Very severe hane by White];B[hk];W[hl]LB[hi:A]
C[White 78 at 'A' is simpler I think.];B[hi];W[ik];B[gh];W[gg]
;B[ii]LB[fg:A]C[Playing at 'A' probably capture the White group on the left side.]
;W[jh];B[ji];W[kh];B[ki];W[lh];B[kk]LB[fg:A]C['A' is more profitable I think]
;W[kl];B[lk];W[mj]C[Strange shape];B[li];W[mi];B[mh];W[mg];B[nh]
;W[jf];B[ll];W[nk];B[km];W[jl];B[lo]LB[lm:A][ln:B]C[This leave the cut at 'A' and it feels bad. Black 'B' is simpler]
;W[jn];B[lq];W[lm];B[mm];W[ln];B[mn];W[kn]LB[ml:A][mo:B]C[Now the bad shape is exposed. Black has two cutting points and can only defend one of them.]

;B[nr];W[lp];B[pn];W[qn];B[qm];W[qo];B[ql];W[qr];B[pi]LB[qh:A]
C[Often the tesuji in this shape is to play "on the nose" at 'A'. I do not know if it is better though.]
;W[qi];B[qj]C[This look good.];W[oi];B[ph];W[qk];B[rj];W[pl]
;B[rk];W[pg];B[oh];W[nf];B[oe]LB[qh:A][rg:B]C[Black cannot answer at 141 but must play at 'A' which also threaten 'b' in case white can do something on the upper side.]
;W[qh];B[oj];W[pk];B[pm];W[og];B[ol];W[ni];B[rn]LB[fg:A]C[Now Black 'A' is huge.]
;W[ro];B[rm];W[nb]C[This is a very clever move by White. Perhaps Black should have defended against this.]

;B[ka];W[qa];B[oc];W[nc];B[la];W[na];B[ob];W[of];B[mb];W[lj]
LB[fg:A]C[Black can perhaps ignore this kothreat, because if White cuts then I beleive that Black 'A' will save Black.]

(;B[kj]C[See the variation];W[lb];B[qq];W[pa];B[pq];W[ib];B[ic]
C[Bad move.];W[hd];B[fg];W[ff];B[eg];W[ef];B[ei]C[Did Black really play here?]
;W[eh]C[White wins by 10+ points.

Black lost because:
1) Failed to take advantage of the thickness in the lower left
2) Did not cut two weak groups in upper left quadrant.
3) Played too complicated moves instead of simple good ones.
4) Played bad inefficient moves at f7 and m5.
5) Pulled out a heavy group on the left side after the mistake of f7

White played completely unreasonable and Black should have won without any effort. But White also seemed to be better at tactics and saw the oppurtunities that the black mistakes gave.]
