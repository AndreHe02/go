AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hello dear reviewer !

This game was played on OGS so I had plenty of time (but I've played some move without thinking...). After a discussion I learned my opponent was 1D on KGS (and I'm 1k/2k on KGS).
I felt good in the opening (even if it was hard to play four handi stones) but the game turns bad for me as I end with a big dead dragon that made me resign in the end (was it possible to make it live by the way?)

I'm looking for any advice here, how I could have done better and how I could improve my way of thinking.

Thanks a lot for the review !]PL[W];W[fc]C[Xinwen:::

Hello, I'm your reviewer rated amateur 3-dan in my Country while ranks varied in other servers.

To provide as much opinions, i have asked my peers to join this review too:-

Ele - China 2-dan
Pei - China 3-dan

This is also my first time reviewing a handicap game, so hopefully it helps you.]
;B[cf];W[nc];B[lc]LB[ne:A]C[Xinwen:::

Usually i would expect White to "A" here.

[follow A to see variation\]]
(;W[ic]LB[nd:A]C[Xinwen:::

Black "A" to show suggestion

[follow A to see variation\]]
(;B[pf]LB[nd:a]C[Xinwen:::

I reckon Black to be played at "a", intended to seal white.]
;W[pb]LB[qh:a]C[Pei:::
White should played at "a" to test first (usual handicap technique).

Ele:::
Agreed];B[qc]LB[oc:a][nd:b]C[Xinwen:::

I  prefer Black to go "a" or "b "to seal White in. This is too honest for Black.

Usually, i would seal White inside; for a bigger picture, Black will get a nice wall of influence 

Pei:::

the exchange is not good for White.];W[ld]LB[od:a]C[Xinwen:::

Usually White's sabaki answer is at "a", though resulting black gotten a wall which White will not be happy about it.]
;B[kd]LB[md:a]C[Xinwen:::

Frankly, meeting this situation it is how you should look at it. because i also check Black's response at "a"]
;W[kc];B[md]LB[le:A]C[Pei:::

White should actually think about playing at "A".

[follow A to see variation\]]
(;W[lb]LB[mc:A]C[[follow A to see variation\]]
(;B[le]LB[mc:a]C[Xinwen:::

should have sente again at "a", provides black with more choices.]
;W[kb]C[Pei:::

Black is very satisfied with the result

Xinwe:::

Agreed.

Ele:::

Black K4 next!];B[jp]C[Ele::

Exactly.];W[cn];B[cl];W[en]LB[fp:a][hq:b]C[Xinwen:::

In my opinion, i think White's jump is a bit off.

Thus, If i were the White, i would pincer "a" area. which provides more variation.

Pei:::

White should try "b", perplex the game (handicap game) otherwise White doesn't have much chance.]
;B[fp]LB[cg:b][dk:A]C[Xinwen:::

If White goes "A"

[follow A to see variation\]

Pei:::

At this time, i think White should try "b" contact play to test.

Alternative, best to leave the 2 stones for now.]
(;W[cq]LB[hp:b][gq:a]C[Xinwen:::

This is desperate attempt, White usually don't profit. Usually White goes "a" for handicap-trick play.

otherwise "b".

Overall, this is second minor losing move];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo]
LB[dq:a]C[Xinwen:::

I think the correction would be "a".]
(;W[bq]LB[br:a][fr:b]C[Xinwen:::

Usually White B3 would be at "a", then lastly jumping at "b"]
;B[co];W[er];B[fr];W[eq]
(;B[ep]LB[fq:a]C[Xinwen:::

E4 should have been correctly played at "a"];W[fq];B[gq];W[gr]
;B[hr];W[fs];B[hq]LB[cg:a][dg:b][qn:c]C[Xinwen:::

The result here, clearly shows White favoured because White gains sente; nevertheless, the corner is alive unconditionally.

Pei:::

This result favours White back now.

White's possible next move from a, b and c.];W[ch]LB[pj:a]C[Pei:::

Considering Black is a solid-style player, I would go "a" for Black]
;B[db];W[bn];B[ao];W[el];B[cj]LB[di:a]C[Pei:::

Black should try "a".];W[qk];B[qi];W[qn]LB[rp:a]C[Pei:::

Considering White wants to take corner, should have gone "a' immediately instead.]
;B[nq]LB[qo:a][ro:b]C[Xinwen:::

Black Q3 should have been better to be played at "a" or  "b" is considerable.

Pei:::

RIght, without second-thought, Black "b" is best here.];W[rp]
;B[qq]LB[qn:1][rp:3][nq:2][qq:4]C[Xinwen:::

White sente from the exchange, Black "2" was too honest.];W[lq]
LB[dk:a]C[Xinwen:::

M3 probably sente at "a' first

M3 is consider major losing-move.

Pei:::

Considering this is handicap game, i understand how White feel.]
;B[no]LB[no:2][mp:b][lq:1][rq:a]C[Xinwen:::

White "1" overplayed, Black "2" again too honest.

In this situation usually Black would gone "a" however, Black playing "b" now would have killed the White.]
;W[lo];B[jn];W[lm]C[Xinwen:::

White earn too much from overplaying.];B[dm]C[Xinwen:::

Black D7 is going to decide the game.];W[dn]LB[kl:b][pl:A][em:a]
C[Xinwen:::

the burden is too much, White playing "a" will be fine i believe.

Pei:::

White shouldn't join, should "b" run instead.

[follow A to see Pei's variation\]]
(;B[em];W[fn];B[fm]LB[gl:a]C[Xinwen:::

Black can think about jumping at "a" instead, White will be in deeper trouble.]
;W[go]LB[gn:a]C[Xinwen:::

Black "a" here is a tesuji also bit risky, either result in seki or Black sacrifice the group for thicker wall.]
;B[gp];W[gm];B[ho]LB[gl:a]C[Pei::

[!?\]

I would definitely play "a" with my eyes close.

Xinwen:::

[haha\]

Exactly.];W[hn];B[in];W[hl];B[jl];W[fl];B[dk]LB[bf:A]C[Pei:::

Black being too greedy here, facing his life and death.

Of course killing it right now is not easy, so need to test Black's reaction.

[Follow A to see Pei's suggestion\]]
(;W[di]LB[ei:a]C[Xinwen:::

White is also trying to decide the outcome with this move.]
;B[ej];W[fi]LB[gi:a]C[Xinwen:::

Maybe White jumping at "a" better?];B[fj];W[gi];B[gk];W[gl]
LB[bh:c][dh:d][bk:b][hk:a]TR[el][fl]C[Xinwen:::

White should've "a", too much of a risk. Black taking 2 stones are not alive yet.

White then "b" to kill the 2nd-eye however, Black has tesuji at "c" and "d"

Pei::

Ya, should just "a" block instead.];B[hk];W[ik];B[il];W[hj]
LB[ei:A][ii:3][ij:1][jk:2][kk:B]C[Xinwen:::

close combat and life and death situation here. It depends on how you deal with the problems.

Black should atari at "1", then White extend "2" exchanged with "3" thus Black  aiming A cut or B ladder.]
;B[bm];W[cm];B[an]LB[ei:B][ij:A][bl:2][dl:1]C[Xinwen:::

Black has better chance saving the 3 stones at "1" so that Black can aim to cut at "A" and "B".]
;W[bl];B[am];W[dl];B[ck];W[bi]LB[qb:b][ij:c][nm:d][rq:a]C[Xinwen:::

This is probably White's losing move.

Pei:::

B11, gote move];B[nm];W[mn];B[nn]LB[ll:3][pm:1][qm:2][nn:A]
C[Xinwen:::

Another chance of missed, Black should have gone "1" exchange then cap White at "3"]
;W[lk];B[jk];W[ij]C[Xinwen:::

White does not have the time to save that stone.];B[ml];W[ll]
;B[kj];W[mj];B[nk];W[qg];B[ph]LB[oi:a]C[Pei:::

Black should "a" jump for instant kill.];W[nj];B[oj];W[oi];B[pj]

Overall:::

Pei:::

wow, everything died.

Black is good for playing solid shapes, it seems as if he played memorising moves due to the fact of his poor whole board judgment.

to deal with this kind of player, usually i will attempt "testing" move or to mess the games situation.

Suggestion is that, heavy shape tend to leave behind and not saving everything. the same thing to this dragon, shouldn't try to save everything.

Xinwen:::

Thank you for sharing Peiling and cb22.

My way of studies usually getting some professional handicap kifu and studied them too, to learn how professional plays against in handicap game.

In my opinion, you can't do 3-3 usually in handicap game.
Handicap game shouldn't be this simple as well; as long as you spot Black would not do any obvious mistake then you have to realise yourself needing to play more testing move but usually result aggression.]

(;W[bf];B[be];W[ei]C[Pei:::

Something like this.]))
(;B[pl];W[ql];B[ll]C[Pei:::

Black has better control of the game.

The white's group on the left is just too heavy.]))
(;B[fq];W[ep];B[eo]LB[bn:b][dn:c][fo:a][es:1]C[Xinwen:::

it may seems like White has many trick but actually White does not.

With clear reading of White from Variation "a" to "c", you will eventually realised White does not has any profit.

Reason:-
White's corner is not alive, simply Black "1". White will be dead; thus, White needs a gote move to cover.]

Considering the basic joseki played in the mind, clearly doesn't favour White here.]

Black-2 is a haengma, you can see Black can earn profitable side at ease.]
