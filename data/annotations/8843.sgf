AB[pd][dp]C[**My comments in asterisks like so**

**Summative comments -- focus on making good shape and basic tactical goals in the opening and middle game. (Cut the enemy's stones, connect your stones, focus on multipurpose moves.) Try to think critically about where the biggest move on the board is.  Corners are big, approaching corners is big, longggg extensions are big (especially extension from the 4th line to the 3rd line, or extensions facing a corner enclosure), taking a base away from stones to make them weak... Later in the game you began playing atari-atari go, often getting yourself into dubious positions. Try to pay attention to what you hope to gain by playing atari, and make sure not to create weaknesses or strengthen the enemy unnecessarily.  Good luck!**]
;W[pq];B[dd];W[fc]C[**Experiment with the high response, especially in handicap games.**]
(;B[cf];W[db];B[cc];W[ic];B[ci]LB[cb:A][ci:B]C[**Not horrible, but in generally you want to treat A and B as miai - don't take one until White takes the other. A two-space extension on the third line isn't as big as a corner approach. Furthermore, if you want to end in gote, you could definitely play D14 (high, leaves room for a big expansion in gote) --- C14 (low, takes sente) and C11 are inconsistent.**]
