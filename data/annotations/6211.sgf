(;B[ne]C[schemelab [24k\]: hi

kreelix [8k\] hello ill be doing your review if you want contact me on my kgs account if you have any questions or concerns 

this first move is very... intresting i see it as being aimed for center influence and not territory this is not joseki however if you do like this type of move than i recommed the five five opening however it isnt used as often as the 4 4 opening 

but hey whatever works for you];W[pp];B[dp];W[jp]C[hmm. white is clearly aggressive minded.]
;B[ed]C[another center influence move something BIG you ahve to remember is that corners need less stones for more points although the middle can be a big potential gain it would be worth your time to learn to extend to the middle]
;W[pj];B[pe];W[jj]CR[qm][qn][mq][nq][qq]TR[mj][jm]C[there he goes again. another aggressive move.

tengen is an aggresive move but remember that he has TONS of aji 

the marked circles are places you can make life and the triangles are when youd have to run i labeled a few variations 

NOTE : now might not be a good time to invade as he could build a wall of yoru movements]

(;B[en]C[i see a problem arising already all your moves are aimed towards center influence and he has tengen which makes it VERY hard for you to get the center if it were my turn i would do somethings i labeled in the variations]
;W[ep];B[gn];W[do]C[oh my. trouble early. i didn't see it coming]
;B[cp];W[eo];B[co];W[dn]C[I feel walled in already.];B[in]C[this move is not good 

the point of running is to run to life or the edge so you can make life if your running into enemy territory he can easily surrond you 

it would still be hard to surrond you at this point but as the game progressess you could be in big trouble]
;W[cn];B[eq];W[fq];B[er];W[fn];B[em]C[here
this is the point when he can cut you 
check the variation]
(;W[fr];B[bn];W[gp];B[gm];W[fo];B[ip];W[iq];B[hp];W[hq];B[hi]
C[this is a bit to far off for black doesnt really help you running 

a note you should make is when your running start with small jumps and than get bigger as they get safer]
;W[pf];B[ji];W[fm];B[il];W[el];B[gl];W[fl];B[gj];W[bm];B[ao]
;W[dj];B[am];W[cm];B[bl];W[bk];B[kl];W[cl]TR[lj][ml][lm][kn]
[ln]SQ[nl][mn][ko][lo]C[very small move
let this go  its only one point if you were to jump to any of the labeled areas it could be worth MUCH more]
;B[al];W[ak];B[an]
(;W[br]C[a bold move...

sort of not really to make life in there would be hard labeled is a variation that would reduce you and kill stones with no doubt]
;B[dr]TR[bq]C[i dont like this move 
it seems like it is to slow if it were me i would go to the labeled point  it guarntees life]
;W[df];B[bq];W[cj];B[cr]C[I need to make sure this doesnt turn into a nightmare in the lower left corner...

you made sure it didnt turn into a nightmare with b3 ^.^];W[dd]
;B[ef];W[cc];B[de];W[ce];B[ee];W[dg]C[As it stands, i'm behind on territory.]
;B[kj];W[ec];B[fc];W[gc];B[gd]C[I have the potential to own the center... but how to leverage this?]
;W[fb];B[fd];W[hc];B[ij]C[no bad move 
**smacks wrist 
that stone was already dead there is no point to do that its such a small move there are much bigger moves elsewhere]
;W[jd];B[lp];W[lq];B[kp];W[kq];B[jo];W[jq];B[jg]C[small again ^.^]
;W[md];B[le];W[ld];B[nl];W[od];B[og];W[pg];B[oe];W[me];B[nf]
;W[fg]C[Cut him i labeled the variation :\]]
(;B[gg];W[gh];B[hg];W[fi]C[tuc [24k\]: !! au temps];B[je];W[gi]
;B[ni];W[mp];B[no]C[big mistake if he caught this youd be in lots of trouble i labeled the variation :)]

(;W[np];B[nd];W[nc]C[heres a chance for you 

not that big but still a good move i labeled he variation]
(;B[ph];W[qh];B[pi]C[Ignore from here out... I realized I was out of time and began to rush my moves.]
;W[qi];B[jk];W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[ng];W[qd];B[nk];W[nj];B[pd]
;W[oc];B[mj];W[oj]C[block him from coming in first]
(;B[ke];W[pc];B[ie];W[hd]C[schemelab [24k\]: add time please]
;B[he]C[tuc [24k\]: comment on fait];W[pn];B[mf];W[qq]C[another big chance here 

i labeled a variation depending on what youplay and when you play it you could pull of about the same amount of points as his r3]

(;B[nn];W[ff];B[gf];W[eg];B[kd];W[ge];B[mc];W[lc]C[schemelab [25k\]: thank you
tuc [23k\]: merci pour la partie
tuc [23k\]: bey..

schemelab [25k\]: au revoir
tuc [23k\]: a une prochaine...
schemelab [25k\]: "prochaine" je ne comprends pas

schemelab [25k\]: oh next time
tuc [23k\]: sorry for my english
schemelab [25k\]: oui oui monsieur, au revoir
schemelab [25k\]: :)

All right thats the review  in closing i have a few comments

1.) CORNER SIDE CENTER 
this used to be a big problem for me the corners are gold you want them if you can get them at no expense i base my games off this now starting of with 4 4 points of 3 4 points 

2.) Big moves veruses small moves 
you want all the big moves you can get small moves mean nothing if they get the big move its like handing him free points

3.) Sente versuess gote 
two terms of go are sente and gote 

sente means the person has to respond and you get the next move 

gote means that he gets the next move

very similar to big moves and small moves 
make sure that you look for those important moves

4.) What an awesome player you are 
you seem like a player who justs needs to know the basics to get started if you learn the basics of go im sure you could become 18 -15 kyu in a month easily 

these would include tesujis, josekis, Life and Death, point value 

if you dont know what these are feel free to message me on KGS my name is kreelix and i would be glad to show you some  of them]
