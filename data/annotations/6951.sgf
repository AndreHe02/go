C[This time I've played with 1d player - for some reasons he selected black with no komi. I've won here but this was only because black make a trap for themselves at the very end.
I think that in this game my mistakes may be more visible (my partner helps with this :)
Thank you.

Hi,

I'm happy to be reviewing your game. My reading skills aren't what they used to be, but I hope you can learn from my analysing skills :) There is a summary at the end of the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[ip];W[cj]LB[nc:B][qn:A]
[nq:C]C[Personally I don't prefer this move, and as you probably know 'A' is definately more common, and 'B' for more moyo preferable players. C is also nice with J4 being so short.]
;B[pj];W[nc];B[kd]LB[qc:B][ne:A][pf:D][qf:C]C[In this formation O15 is better than R17?

Well, there are alot of possibilities, most commonly are marked. I think O15 is fine.

(you can check variations and set your preference yourself :)]

(;W[ne];B[pf]LB[qc:A]C[A is still possible.]
(;W[pb];B[qc];W[kb]C[I think this is satisfactory for both]
;B[ng]LB[nq:A]C[now can I tenuki or L17 is vital?
Is tengen big?

For me it's hard to tell. I think 'A' is the move I'd prefer, however the timing of L17 is hard, so it may hurt you in the long run to avoid it.

As for tengen, I think it's too early, and some territory still needs to be settled.]

(;B[jb]C[I think this is too hasty. (variation)];W[kc];B[jc]
;W[jd];B[ld];W[mc];B[hc]
(;W[lf]LB[je:A]C[This is an overplay. A is correct, it give a much easier fight.]
;B[kf]LB[id:A]C[which moves for white is good here?

The truth is, no matter what, this is going to be hard for white.

As you point out yourself though, A is good :)]
(;W[lg];B[je];W[nf];B[og];W[df]C[Locally this is good, but I hope your juedgement told you that this game was going bad :)]
;B[jh];W[li]C[This is overprotective, don't worry too much about your tengen stone in this scenario.]
;B[kj];W[ni];B[jk]LB[nq:A]TR[ne][lf][nf][lg][li][ni][jj]C[I can't decide which move would be good here. L12 looks ugly.
May be simple L11?

In the last few moves 'A' has been a very urgent point, and by fighting in the middle, all white has achieved is making black stronger.

It does seem ridicolous to let black H10, but continuing the middle fight is simply just wrong focus.

Okey, I've looked through your variations, and if your concerned with your middle group securing it with r18 rather than this. It may sound harsh, but, right now the marked stones have achieved absolutely nothing, so white is terribly behind.]

You do, it's good :)];B[ki];W[lh];B[hg];W[nq]C[Is O3 best point to invade now?

Yes.]

Sure, I prefer D2.

C[I don't like this exchange for white. It's too dangerous and complicated for my taste :)]
;W[dl]C[Seems like I deal bad with C8.
Is C8 too deep?

C8 Is fine. Black almost threw away his last chance... (Variation)]

(;W[bp]LB[bn:A]C[This seems rather suicidal.

Black A seems very intimidating.

I also think trying to kill the big B2 group is...  a little farfetched.

You need to develop your fighting skills, and your judgment skills, because mostly your moves generally made sense. 

You played more stable than your opponent, as he made some terrible blunders, where as you generally just made small mistake in direction and judgement.

Work on it! And feel free to ask any questions at lasse@tengen.dk]
