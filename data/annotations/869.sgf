C[My name is Ray Costantini, and I live  in Tucson, AZ.  I won this game, but not  by as much as I think that I should  have.  I was hoping that you would  look this game over and give me some  suggestions.  I added my own  comments and a few variations, but  any additional advice would also be  greatly appreciated. Thanks.

P.S.  I am black

Hi Raymond,

I did not review the variatiosn because the fundamental ideas are the same of the main game.
The central idea is that you cannot expect to kill your opponent everywhere. You have to let him take a little so you can take a lot. When you trade territory for strength should keep consistent on your strategy and seal your opponet and use your strength to attack on the outside.

PL[B];B[dj];W[ck]C[c3 is not really the best option for white
If the sequence could finish with sente for  white then
it would be alright for white. otherwise the game
is already over.];B[dk];W[cj];B[ci];W[di];B[dh]C[d6 is no good because it puts d5 in motion and weakens the black stones. Posible options are b5 or b6]
;W[ch]C[white should have played e5];B[ei];W[bi]C[I think that I lost this corner  somewhere after about here.  I suspect  that I lost it because I was being too  greedy and not paying attention to my  threatened groups.  I put in two  variations that I looked at afterwords.   The one that perplexes me the most is  the second one.

Actually when white played on the inside and black on the outside the normal thing to do for black is to let white take
the corner and use the outside wall as strenght to take the
lower right corner]
(;B[bh]C[This is alright but a complicated ko. It would be simpler to play c7 to seal white]
;W[cg];B[bj];W[ai]C[White should play the ko here and keep a5 as a ko treat]
;B[di];W[bk];B[ij]C[strenght should be use to attack not to make territory.
j4 is too close to the wall k4, k3 , l3, l4 are options];W[jk]

(;W[hm]LB[im:A]C[Here, I think my opponent  overextended himself.  What could I  have done if he had instead played at  A?

Or, alternatively, if there was no  way to kill this group if he didn't  overextend himself, was there a way to  play this so that the corner white group  was not so strong?

Same thing here as before. White should live in the
corner and black should take the upper right corner];B[jl];W[im]
;B[gm];W[kl];B[jm];W[km];B[jj]C[k4 is a wasted move. k11 or l11 are better options]
;W[mj];B[mh]C[same thing here. better to play l7 to fix teh shape of the wall or play on the upper right. Of course upper left is also an option]
;W[kf]C[white is play to close to blach strenght. It is better to play
upper left corner or upper right];B[ke]C[l10 or k10 would be better. don´t play to close to the
stone under attack];W[jg];B[lf];W[lg]
(;B[mg];W[le]C[White probably mentally out of the game by now.
It is better to resign at this point.];B[kg];W[je];B[jf];W[kd]
;B[kf];W[lc];B[me]C[n9 not the best option here. k9 or k10 better]
;W[ld];B[ie]C[k9 or k10 better];W[jd];B[id];W[ic];B[ml]C[h11 bigger. If white plays n2 black takes the upper left]
;W[if];B[ig]C[j7 weakens the j9 group. Better g10];W[jh];B[ih]
C[better h8];W[gd];B[hf]C[I was dubious as to whether this was  the best move to make at the time.  I  have a habit of jumping the gun on  captures like this, and was unsure  about this one.  It seemed to make  sense, because it lent itself to  obtaininga low central moyo, but it  seemed to cost me the whole top of the  board.

you lost the upper board when you played n2];W[hd];B[fg]LB[dd:A]
[fe:B]C[Or perhaps it was this stone that was  misplayed.  Would it have been better  to play at A and initiate a corner  territory, or perhaps at B and contain  whites growing moyo at the top of the  board?

d10 or c11 are better options for black];W[gf];B[gg]C[Again c11]
;W[ff];B[ef]C[again c11];W[ge]C[ c11 or d10 or d9 for white here]
;B[ed];W[dg]C[around c11 is the logical move for both players]

(;B[de]LB[eg:A]C[Here, I think that I should have gotten  cut by a more experienced opponent, if  he had played at A.]
;W[cc]C[finally!];B[eg];W[dd]
(;B[cd]LB[dc:A]C[Here, in hindsight, I played with the  idea of attacking from the top, instead  of the bottom, but it seemed that then I  just lost the left moyo.]

  When I played it out a couple of ways,  white ended up with the whole left side  of the board.
