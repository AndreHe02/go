C[Stan: Hi, Thank you so much for reviewing my game.
In general, i felt that me and my opponent are quite well matched.
I did made a big mistake at the end of the game, however, even without the mistake, I realize I still lost to him about 10 points.
Just want to understand where should I have play better in the game.
Thanks

Hi, I'm Eric, Sisyph on KGS. I will review your game. My comments will begin with some hyphens.

I will try to focus on specific points, but I have included some long variations to give some possible continuations. these long variations are not what to do but a possibility.

There is a summary at the end of the file. I use some japanese terms, have a look on internet if you do not know them. i use some bad English too, I apologize.

This is not standard. I think it is bad because black will flatten you.

Usually you invade with A which black awaits for or you approach with B.]

(;W[or]TR[nq][pq]C[Stan: Is this attack too slow? because black ended up cornering me in L4

I think that is your first big mistake. You should try to avoid those moves. 
In the beginning (fuseki), try to :

- play where there is room to make points
- not create weak groups

Your move is not really an attack and bad:

- black is strong, he has 2 stones near the edge.
- you are weaker than black because he is one move ahead of you
- the shape of the triangled stone is bad for you 
- it is a play on the second line, more an endgame move.

before such a move (endgame move) you have to extend near K4. If you do not black can attack you, as you have seen in the game.

See variations.];B[kp]LB[lq:A]C[--
I think black can have played, which is severe.]
(;W[qr]C[--
No !

Black surrounds you, you have to flee and/or make your stones live !
Your move will not really give you any eye and you can not flee this way !
This is and engame move];B[pr]TR[pq][or][qr]C[--

Note: the four triangled stones make a very bad shape for white. 

Your one-space-jump (tobi) is torn apart by black !
If you go this way, R2 should be at Q2.];W[ps];B[qq]
(;W[lq]C[--
This is good. You make some room for your stones to make life, but black can probably seal you in !]
;B[no]TR[jc][pd][qk][po][kp][qq]C[--
Black is building a nice framework (moyo). Maybe you should have fled.]

(;W[kq]C[Is this necessary or I should have just jump to k3?

--
This is ok. Black can not really hane (see var.)]
(;B[rr]C[I felt black got distracted by my seed in R2, giving me a sente

--
Yes. He should have sealed you inside and/or build strength. Good for you.]
;W[ip]C[--
Very good ! K4 will do too, and is probably better :)];B[lo]

(;W[in]C[--
Your idea to play at the edge of the two frameworks is good. 

Here, I think the problem is that the left side is too open. So your framework (moyo) is less solid than black's. Hard to tell. 
A move around d5 is possible too, and maybe better in this case.]

(;B[cj]TR[cg][cm]C[--
Black invades. Note that black can have a good extension on both sides (triangles).]
;W[cl];B[cg];W[gc]C[--
Good checking extension.];B[ge]C[--
Not good.]
(;W[el]LB[qc:A][qf:B][pj:C]C[Stan: Is this move too slow?

--
In fact it is bad because it induces black to play a defensive move that secure his group. you should have played the keima which attacks black more.

Maybe you should consider invading/reducing now, with moves around A, B, C.

See variation.]

Black is happy. He defends and his framework grows.

Here you have to count to adapt your strategy.

You have more point (sure ones) but black has the biggest potential...

The best is probably a deep invasion with a big reduction. See variation.]

[bk]C[Stan: I was unsure where to play here, i was thinking of attacking directly into K14/K15 as I felt black seems to have a very big area on the top

-- 
This move makes invasion/reduction harder.

Considering territory, you are leading.
Now, you have to invade before black close his moyo. 

Black moyo is open around A, B, C and D.
You can invade or reduce at E to I. 

There is big endgame moves to do at the squared points.

The difficulty is to keep sente to make as many things as possible :)

Black might be able to invade at the tringled points, even if it is hard.]

You are welcome. I learn a lot when I comment games.

At your level (and mine too) there is a lot of errors. but you play well. try to avoid the most problematic moves, like your first "attack" at A.

When fighting in your zone of influence eg when you are stronger than black, try to use your strength. You must punish overplays, like the two black invasions in the upper and lower left corners.

And learn endgame standard moves. You ca gain a lot of points this way. You could have win just by playing good endgame moves.

And do not answer you opponent's moves. Analyse and play the best move possible.

Have fun !])
