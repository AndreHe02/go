;W[qj];B[qh];W[qn]C[Until here a perfectly normal fuseki. White will normally play
either A (Q7) or B (R7). A makes a better connection with C (R10).
R6 is playable, though, but White should probably have continued
in another way (see continuation in variation b) after Blacks invasion. The  Pl
ayed
move is normally not used in this situation, because black is too strong in
the upper right corner.];B[ql]
(;W[qq]C[This is wrong in the given  situation.];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[nq];B[mo];W[rd]C[Interesting move. The meaning behind this move is to determine,
where to play next. if black answers R15, White can reduce the
outside with the possibility of a life in the corner later (the
life would be gote though, so it's not too large. If black anaswers
in the corner (R17 or S17, White can play R15 to get some sabaki.];B[mq]
C[Again good move, a punishment for whites defiance to answer N5.
Both players play very aggressive. White cannot omit an asnwer here,
since blac P2 as followup woulc kill the corner.];W[oq]C[All right, it's an  answer, but probably the worst thinkable
(apart from abandoning the group. Black should play N2 (I
think immediately), since it threatens a flower-viewing ko
(this is a ko, where only one part will benefit from winning it).];B[mr]
C[Good]

;W[rh];B[ri];W[rf];B[sh];W[rg]C[Though the sequence played seems  natural, white has gotten a weak
group here, while giving black extremely good prospects in the lower
right.
White Should of course play ko here, this is not a flower-viewing one, in that
black would lose a much too. Dur to the bad shape, nearly every black play  aroun
d
P14 is sente (threatening to kill white, so black
gets very thick here.];B[qi];W[oe]C[Just asks black to take territory while  trying to get out of the
enclosure.];B[md];W[lq]C[Whites play until now wasn't especially good, but  this move is
probably the worst done by white. It's a 10-point gote move,
that gives black tremendous thickness. Since the white group
in the corner is absolutely safe now, there really is no reason to make
such a abad move.];B[kq];W[lr];B[kr];W[ms]
(;B[nf]C[Black could try to kill  white by playing Q14, but this would
probably be to much to expect. This is a good, relaxed way of
playing, though I would have preferred O13. this move doesn't
leave any white escape routes into the black framework, and if white answers
O13 by N15, black just plays M16 to take more territory on the fourth
line.];W[pf]C[This is probably the best white play, though it really
hurts to have to live like this.];B[fp]C[Wrone direction of play. There are  three problems with this move:

1) It's much too cleose to the black thickness above, which doesn't work
to it's fullest. Black should get some territory on the left side first,
by playing C6 for instance. If White tried to get away with sente
(C6-F3-B4-C9-E16), black coule attack white with
B2, since white doesn't have two eyes in the corner then. There is the basic
proniple: use thickness to attack, DON'T use thickness to build territory.

2) The followup to O14 is somehwhere in the upper left corner (D16, E16  ,E17 o
r
F16. Thereby black can build an enourmous framework, which would be consistent
with his strategy so far.

3) This point is not only wrong directed, there is really no one
who really would want to play here (White approaching black thickness
--> White does get a weak group and little prospects,
Black approaching White from this site:
--> White gets a strong group here, while blacks territorial prospects
don't match the amount of stones invested.];W[fq]C[Maybe better at C7, though  it could be just a matter of taste.]
;B[gq];W[eq];B[gp]C[Black has invested  very many stones (7 + 2 captured), to surround
~15 points. In the meantime white has secured a
corner that is bigger than 15 points, with just three stones!!!!

Black should either have taken the corner instead of the approach move
or otherwise should have approached from hte other side.];W[cn]C[? D6 is of  course the point to play.]
;B[en];W[on]C[Black is much to strong after the  N2,N3-capture. If Black plays
S6 now, white is in dire straits. White could have played s6, to
see, if black is satisfied with q6, though it's probably still
too much to expect.];B[pm]C[good kikashi.];W[pn];B[oo]C[Though it should have  been followed by s6. Still white does have bleak p
rospects.];W[rn];B[so];W[nm];B[ok];W[lm]
(;B[km]C[This move merely helps  white. The intention must be to secure some terri
tory
around the lower black group, but in the meantime black hurts his own 'small'
group between the two white ones. Black should play as shoed in the  variation.]
;W[ln];B[lo];W[kl]C[
 runski 9k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[jm];W[mj]C[All of a sudden whites group  has become stable, only due to
blacks overly concern with territory at L8. Furthermore
an attack against the black group above does seem possible.];B[ml]C[Too late,  as white can fight back strongly with o8.]
;W[nl];B[mm];W[nk]C[? White had a  fine counter going on, and black could have done nothing
(useful) against n6 - of course he could runawawy at n9, but then
white could make a counter attack against the black group above.
White took the initiative with o8
only to let it slip away again. Still blacks group above seems to
come under attack soon.];B[oj]C[This is slack. If white continues with  m9,n6,j9, blacks
moyo is in ruins and he has no further prospects of getting anything
in the center. And in the meantime white got a big corner around D4.];W
[mh];B[ll]C[Seems like an overplay, in that White is out in the open and blacks  grou
p
seems to be in trouble. It's hard to tell, but I think, white could have
captured the black stones by playing correct.];W[og];B[ng]
(;W[nh];B[oh];W[sk]C[Monkey Jump is a good endgame move, but it rather
seldom is a good move to capture a group. normally you can find better moves,  if
you really want to kill something. Anyway, black plays wrong and dies.]

 kokogogo 7k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[pl];B[pk]C[Wrong. black R9 either  secures two eyes or connection along
the edge.];W[rl];B[qk];W[rk];B[sn];W[rm];B[rj]C[Wrong... Black could have  livedwith O10 (threat to cut white
and capture whites group).];W[nj]C[Game over.];B[fc]C[maybe better at E17.]
;W[cf];B[cm]C[This is a hard way of playing. normally Black would play
D16-C16-K16, but maybe black estimated that this wouldn't be
enough.];W[dn]C[Bad shape, should only be played when white wants to cut  (which
in turn seems like an overplay). Should have been C5-D7-J16.];B[dm];W[bm]
C[this is definitely wrong. black presses white down in sente (black shou
ld
connect at e7) and can play the combination named before to try
to get the whole upper side.];B[bl]C[Overplay again. now this is gote for  black. the
low and stable position of white at C14 means, that blacks thickness
is cancelled out, so white can invade the upper side after blacks  connection.]
;W[bn];B[el];W[ci]C[big point, but not urgent. urgent would be an  invasion on the
upper side.];B[ff]C[Finally one player tries to enclose the upper side, but  this is
much too loose. should have been the combination mentioned before
or maybe just J16.];W[ne]C[? White urges black to strengthen the upper side,  as to make
an invasion harder? White may be aiming at some aji above, but I
can't see any way as to utilize aji, if black just plays n15.


 kokogogo 7k*: Increase runski's time by 10 minutes];B[me];W[kg]C[White seems  all too impressed with blacks (very loosely) secured upper
 side.
Of course white has just made it harder for himself to
invade by the 'thank you'-moves before, but there is really no need
just to give black the upper side without getting anything at all in return.]

stones N2 and N3 and giving black excellent thickness).
