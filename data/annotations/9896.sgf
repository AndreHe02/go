AB[pd][dp]C[Hi so some general things in advance.
1 If you repeatedly do a mistake could you tell me repeatadly so i really see it?
2 Could you in the end sum up the general principles that i did not follow and the mistakes i or the other player did?

Questions id like answered:

What is my weakest game?
Early- Mid- or Endgame?

Do you see general mistakes?

What do you think is the best way to get bether?]
(;W[dc]C[Hi, I'll try my best to review and sum up your mistakes at the end :)]

(;B[ce]C[I believe i dont have to go for the third corner here and that one is ok.]

(;W[fd]
(;B[dh]C[This way you give White the freedom to choose where to play next and result is quite balanced (considered it's a handicap game)]
;W[pp]C[so in my perspective he didnt get the corner up left so the exchange was ok for me and his group uptop is still weak

Comment:
Well, I still think the lower right corner is quite big and it's a shame white got it so easily.]
;B[hc]C[Is this ok? wanted to punish him for not closing

Comment:
Why do you want to punish white for not closing? You didn't close your side either.]

C[mistake by him?

Comment:
Well, it's a handicap game, so I wouldn't call it a mistake. I think White simply wants to see what you will respond here. But considering your other stones in the area it's probably not a very good idea.]

(;B[nd]C[Not punishing him too much is R 17 better?
Very unsure about the following sequence.

I want to build a wall and crush R 14 and succeed but just because he doesnt defend.

Comment:
Crushing R14 is nearly impossible (the whole right side is still open), but O16 isn't a bad idea.]

This was bad by him, but your response wasn't better, why didn't you play O14?]

in general i still feel like him trying to live is what winns me the game.

maybe 1 is better here?

I still hate N4 :(
Well still check the variations. In this situation I like O14 and so on best, but of all your suggestions I guess I like the one you actually played (P12) best.]

You have so many stones there, I don't think White can invade at all. And as I said before: A is a very weak group!]

Honestly your idea of killing white is very complicated, why don't you let white live very small? I think you got more points and you should focus your attention to bigger points.]

Do you see general mistakes?

What do you think is the best way to get bether?

Comment:
Alright, since this was a handicap game, I can't really say anything about your opening, but I think you were weakest at the endgame. Next time try to play moves your opponent has to reply to and don't defend, if you don't need to. I think you gave away like at least 5 points for just pointlessly defending.
Also try to look out for cutting points next time.

On how to get better:
Honestly I can't tell you how you can get better, since it depends on what kind of person you are. There are multiple ways on how to get better at go:
1. Play a lot
2. Let someone review your games
3. Read go-books (There are quite a lot books on different aspects, but you need to like studying with books)
4. Listen/Read Go reviews on the net. There are multiple youtube channels, where you can find people talking about go for free.
5. Solve Go-Problems. Again there are books with go-problems, but you can also for example use this site: http://goproblems.com/ (If you didn't know this yet) I think solving a few go-problems is always a good idea ;)

Feel free to try out different methods (you can also combine them) and decide on what helps you best :D

P.s. I hope this review was helpful :) (If you don't understand anything, feel free to check back with me! I'm Sakuchu on KGS)]

(;B[pp]C[Actually I'd most likely would have played this one, but it depends on your playing style.

Just as an advice:
This is a handicap game, which means your opponent most likely has more experience at playing go than you do and knows more variations/go moves. This results in him/her wanting to pick a fight you loose. 
And with your move our opponent didn't even have to try to pick a fight, you started it on your own. 

Also: There is a basic principle in go, the easiest way to make points is in the corner. So if you can take a corner, why not take it? (I showed you something at the start of the game, check it out! :) )]

But the important difference is: For A you needed 5 stones (corner group), for C you needed 7 stones (border group) and for B you needed 10 stones (middle group).
You see how you needed the most stones in the middle? That's why we start playing in the corners, then take the borders and last try to make points in the middle.]
