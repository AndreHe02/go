(;B[qp]C[my idea here was that his forces seemed to be tward the bottom left. i was going to try and build my stones in the top right. was this a good idea?


--Good idea, bad execution. Shoulder hits like that are usually too close to approach the corner. A joseki approach would have worked better, see variation.]
;W[pp]
(;B[qq]C[This is why a shoulder hit is not a good approach. Perhaps you would have acheived a better result with r6 instead of r3 but both end with white having a lot of thickness.]
;W[lq]C[looking back on this move, i think i lost a lot in this.


--indeed.];B[jq]C[--at this point, I would just tenuki; there's too many big points on the board not to do so, like e16 or r10.]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[hq]C[--This seems like a mistake to me. It is just a one space jump, so its living is uncertain at best. If it lives it will be very small. At the same time, it allows white to take e6 and fully break up your formation. I would suggest taking e6 yourself.]
;W[en];B[dn];W[eo];B[do];W[ho]C[-- a waste of white moves. those stone aren't going anywhere.]
;B[jo];W[ip];B[jp]C[--unfortunately, you are now left with a very weak group.]
;W[cg];B[dj];W[qf]
(;B[qe]C[-- This is not a good response. Many people at your level do it, but it would much benefit you to get out of the practice. The contact hit simply encourages a bad sequance, and is only good if you have a stone at say r or q10. Otherwise, see variation.]
;W[pf];B[qm];W[qj]C[--that's a lot of territory for white to get in an area you were strong in.]

;B[gr];W[fr];B[er];W[gq]C[couldn't he have gone F1 and did some damage with the right follow up?]

(;B[dh]C[is there any way i could have done some damage in the top left area?

--unfortunately, i think that was about the best you could do, white's territory is pretty well solidified. Perhaps e13 would have been a better reduction move. See variation.]
;W[bi]
(;B[bh]C[-- As you probably saw right afterwards, this was a bad call. A knight's move is usually to secure to cut, especially at a time like this. See variation.]

;W[ag];B[ah]C[--a simple mistake];W[aj];B[ak]C[--this was dangerous, if white was feeling adventerous she could have tried to set up a ko with b9. b8 is safer.]
;W[ai];B[bl];W[eh];B[fb];W[eb];B[gb]C[--try not to do this. This is gote, and is not that big, instead, try to take sente somewhere else yourself. perhaps m9?]
;W[dc];B[cb];W[cc];B[bc];W[bd]C[i tried...

--there's nothing wrong with an overplay to try and make some points. This was a pretty big overplay though!]
;B[ab];W[ba];B[db];W[da];B[fa];W[ea];B[bb];W[ca];B[nd]C[--try o15 instead.]

;W[os];B[rr];W[oq]C[i'm pretty sure P3 was a waist of a turn, was it not?

--seems like it to me. She was afraid of the p3 cut, but i dont think it would have done any good.]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[qc]C[i decided it was time to try and strengthen the top corner, incase the opponent got brave. was this too soon in your oponion?

--this is actually an unneeded move, you're safe against the 3-3 invasion because of r15. However, with an area that big I can see your concern.]

-- well first of all, you're lucky white didn't do the monkey jump at t18.]
;B[rd];W[sd];B[rf];W[se];B[rg];W[rb]C[--here white has made a big mistake that you unfortunately missed. q13 will do an unbelievable amount of damage.]

;W[oj];B[pk];W[fk];B[cl]C[was C8 required?

-- i don't think so. I assume you're worried about the cut at e9, but if you read it out you'll see that there's nothing to worry about.]
;W[ie];B[hd];W[iq]C[instead of J3, could he have done some serious damage with L15 or K16? these two spots worried me.


--certainly not with L15, but K16 is more worrisome. I read out many different trees, and in conclusion i think that L15 would have at the very least presented you with an oppurtunity to make a very bad mistake, and at worst would have destroyed your entire position.]
;B[ir];W[ks];B[kd]C[i decided not to risk it.

--good choice.];W[kp];B[ko];W[mm];B[ml];W[mn];B[js];W[ls];B[tt]
C[i only won because of the kami. and i feel i could have played much better. please be as brutally honest as possible.thank you for the review.


--that shoulder hit of white's corner stone may have been your biggest mistake, along with the response to white's approach of the upper right. I suggest you simply learn a few corner approach josekis. This doesn't have to be anything complicated, and you don't need to memorize anything. Just look at them as a reference for how to approach and respond in very common cases.

Looking at the board, the sight should very much encourage you. You have all side territory, while white's is merely composed of middle. If it hadn't been for the careless prisoners you lost earlier in the game, you would have won. You only would have had to been a little more effective in center reduction in order to have greatly reduced white's middle.

In conclusion, your regular play is strong for your level, and if you can get more comfortable with corner josekis and watch out for careless mistakes, i think you will soon gain several stones.
