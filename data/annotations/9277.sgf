C[Hallo, my name is Ulrich. This is a KGS game a won by 1/2 point. Some luck was involved. I played B.

Could you please review for both sides and give hints for local or global better play.

Reviewer:

Hi Ulrich, my name is Rainer and I did the review for this game. I hope you find my comments helpful for your future games.

Up to move 97 White was ahead. From there White made three big mistakes which Black could exploit.

Best regards,

Rainer];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[qj]C[Reviewer:
I would stick to the basics. Corner, side, center...]

I think it would be better to play in the vacant corner.];W[dd]

(;B[qf]CR[rf]C[Reviewer:
That is giving White too much. A play at the circled point would be correct.]
;W[rf]
(;B[qb]CR[rg]C[Reviewer:
This is too small and gote for Black. Better to cut of the lone white stone and put pressure on it.]

(;W[rg]CR[jp]C[Reviewer:
A play at the bottom would be bigger for White.];B[qh]C[Happy to push on the 3. line even bigger moves are around

Reviewer:
That's ok, this way you keep some pressure on White.];W[ri]

(;B[mf]LB[mh:C][jj:B][jp:A]C[are the alternatives stronger?

Reviewer:
Point A would be my favorite as it compliments the kakari in the lower right corner and initiates an attack on the lower left.
Point B would not gain much at the moment.
Ponit C would be possible, but isn't as thick as the actual play.]
;W[jp]C[Reviewer:
Good move.];B[jj]CR[fc][lp][cq]C[Reviewer:
Doesn't gain much. There are other possibilities.];W[cn]CR[gc]

Save, but not very big.];B[fp]C[I was aiming to reduce the lower left]
;W[hq];B[eq];W[dq];B[gn]C[Reviewer:
The small knights move is dangerous in this situation as it can be cut.]

(;W[mp]CR[mq]C[Reviewer:
I would prefer this on the third line.];B[nq];W[np]C[This move surprised me as I can reduce W's base]
;B[mq];W[kq];B[lq];W[lp];B[ko];W[jo];B[kn];W[kp];B[kl]C[In my opinion not the best for W

Reviewer:
No, it was not. But, as often, the problems are a result of earlier moves.]
;W[rm]C[Reviewer:
That's too small and probably gote.];B[rn];W[qm];B[im]C[I felt I need to connect

Reviewer:
The connection is still loose, a cut is possible. But you are right, to do something for the distant stones is ok.]
;W[ic]C[Reviewer:
Good move.];B[jc]
(;W[fc]LB[id:A]C[good move from W

Reviewer:
I would prefer point A, because in case of an invasion in the corner I would have a little wall to work with.]

(;B[cf]C[If W seals of here the territory is too big
Instead of this move, can I live in the upper right, making W overconcentrated?

Reviewer:
It is possible to live in the corner (see variation, just one possibility shown). But you would help White building a wall facing the left side.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[ch];B[ff];W[id];B[dl]TR[cf][df][ff]C[Reviewer:
The marked stones are under attack. Black ought to take care of that first.]

(;W[cl]C[Reviewer:
I think it would be better to attack the three black stones.]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[ej];W[di];B[ei]LB[ek:A]C[Reviewer:
Black has build two big moyos by now and is leading in influence and possible territory. White has to attack. Black sooner or later will have to cover the possible cutting point at A.]
;W[pn];B[qp];W[if]C[Reviewer:
Good move.];B[hg];W[ig];B[ih];W[hf];B[gg];W[kg];B[ke];W[jh]
;B[ii]C[Reviewer:
White did a good job reducing Blacks influence.];W[mj]C[I felt I could seal my territory in the upper right when attacking the stone

Reviewer:
Good move from White. It reduces Black while building moyo.]
;B[li]
(;W[mi]LB[oj:A][ml:B]C[Surprise - I did exspect the variation (point A)

Reviewer:
Point B would be even more advantageous for White, I think.]

(;B[lh]C[no real need to run here, better jump into W area with the variation.

Reviewer:
You are right.];W[lm];B[km];W[mn];B[ll];W[ml];B[oj];W[ok];B[pj]
;W[pk];B[qi];W[oh]C[Reviewer:
Very good move.];B[rj];W[qk];B[oi]
(;W[rh]CR[nh]C[Reviewer:
This is a big mistake. White has the possibility to severely reduce Blacks territory by just rescuing the invasion stone.]

;B[po];W[om]C[KGS sgf editor estimates I am 7 points behind. I felt like this but did not know how to attack the left corners.
Any way to attack them?
If not: What is best?

Reviewer:
As the game is getting near the end game phase reduction can be achieved by pushing into the opponents territory. See the variation for a possible "attack". It is similar to the approach in your actual game. It gets you about even in points.]

(;B[bf];W[be];B[ai];W[bj];B[bi]CR[eh]C[Reviewer:
Not necessary and actually not a good idea as it is gote. Better cover the cutting points.]
