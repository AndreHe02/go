C[Quacktapus (Black) vs. Ksogaki (White) KGS 2/4/11
White wins by resignation.];B[qd]C[Hi, Quacktapus!

My name is Evgeny and I'm your reviewer.

I've marked your comments with Q, and my comments with J.

As I can see weak point of your play in this game is you attacking white stones too soft letting them to run out. There were a lot of possibilities to kill them or at least to make a lot of profit by attacking them. Remedies of your weaknesess are solving more life and death problems and replaying games of influence oriented pros like Yoo Changhyuk, Takemiya, Cho Hunhyun or Miyazawa Goro. I think it helps you to improve.]

J: Yes, you should let white live while build strong outside influence.]

;B[dk]C[Q: I thought alot about 27 to 37 and I thought I got the most I could from the exchange...

J: Generally black wall is not consistent with your right position because it's low. From this point white is leading]
;W[co]C[J: Strange plan for white. White position is not strong enough to attack. If I were white I would have expanded white stones at K3]
;B[ep];W[bo]C[J: Another strange move. For sure white should connect his stones by playing at E3. Giving black to build a strong wall in sente is a disaster for white.]
;B[do];W[dq];B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[cp]C[Q: At this point I thought I was way ahead. I considered just playing at R5 and defending, but I wanted to do something more impressive with my massive wall. What is the right move here?

J: Last white moves turn around the tables. Black wall worth more than white profit in the corner. From this point black is leading.
Your move looks good. Black is leading, so nothing wrong in simple defencive move.]
;B[kp];W[jo]
(;B[ln]C[Q: I was hoping to come back to R5 soon after this and have a nice box formation...

A: Plan is OK: building a territory while attacking weak group. But implementation is bad. You should have attack white stones more severe from this point]

;W[po]C[Q: ...But my opponent saw through my devious plan. What's the best response here?
J: You should have taken an opportunity and attack white immediately. As for me there are two good moves: first is K4 trying to gauge white base and second is K8 immediately capping weak white group. I would prefered first variant because black makes his own group stronger while attacking white. See variations for details. 
Even if you didn't take and opportunity to attack them your pincer at Q8 is too wide: it neither make a lot of pressure on white stone nor expanding moyo. Low pincer at R7 is better. See variation for details.]
(;B[pl]C[J: Too wide. Your position in upper right corner is low. So you don't have much opportunities to develop it. Taking into account your strong wall at M5, it would have been better to use low pincer at R7 instead of Q8.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[ql];B[qk];W[qm];B[pk]C[Q: Did I play this correctly?

(;B[rk]C[Q: Here I wanted to restrict white as much as possible and see if I could kill. In the end I don't manage to kill white here. Is it possible?
J: I think it's possible to kill. S5 is a weak point of white shape. You could destroy white base and kill entire group. See variations.]

;B[kq];W[jq];B[kr];W[lh];B[hi];W[hj];B[gj]C[Q: This was clearly a mistake, I just wanted to punish white for not responding earlier to my attack... in the end I lose the three stones near the top and a bunch of others I sent in there to try to give it life. does black have a chance to win if move 101 is somewhere else? if it's still bad for Black, where did it go wrong after the beautiful thickness was made? how could I have better used that wall?
J: I think there is still a chance for black. for example: build a wall in center and invade white top. Result will depend of how you will invade. But white chances in my opinon higher. Generally there was no point where things goes wrong for black: they had a lot chances and they missed them. I think you should pay more attention on your attacking skills. You may improve them by solving more Life and Death problems and replaying games of influence oriented styled professional players.

Good bye!
