;W[hp];B[cq]C[It is a better way to take the corner since white haven't deffend it ?

*****  no, i believe this is perfectly fine.  the variation i usually see is a white stone at h3 instead of h4.  however, by playing on the 4th line, white is clearly aiming for center influence.  i think you could also play an attachment at h3, but taking the corner is a safer move.  from here, white is subject to a splitting attack.  i think this move by white was premature.]
;W[cp];B[bp]C[****  i would have played b3 here.  it secures the corner and you end in sente.  otherwise, you can wipe out white's base if s/he plays somewhere else.]
;W[bo];B[br]C[Bad shape
 B3 better

**** i think this would be ok.  i personally don't see the advantage of b3, though someone stronger might see an advantage.  if white plays a4, i would take sente since you can still make two eyes easily.]
;W[ap];B[cf]C[**** i think the approach from f17 makes more sense.  c14 is begging a pincer attack around d11 (or c11).  that attack would put pressure on the c14 stone and make some pretty good territoy on the left side.  if you played f17 and white plays a normal extension around c14, you can still invade or reduce the left side as the situation demands.]
;W[ci];B[cd];W[de];B[dc]C[*** i think c17 would be better, but i'm not familiar with this joseki.  you might look at the online joseki database to see how professionals have played this.]
;W[ce];B[cc]C[b16 better];W[bd];B[bf];W[be];B[bq]C[*** why did you decide to play this?  your three stones in the top left do not have eyes yet and are subject to attack, your two stones around c14 need to be helped, or give them up, and this is a gote move for you.  the bottom left goup is very secure from what i can see.]
;W[ec]C[**** good attack by white.];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gb]
;B[gc];W[hb];B[ee]C[I think e15 will let me live

**** hmm, this is not much of a threat to white.  there are several possible responses that i could imagine.  1) a white play at f15 looks promising.  that appears to eliminate anything that e15 might accomplish.  but, the more devestating attack is c18.  this kills the whole corner from what i can see.  see the variations]

(;W[ed]C[***** as i noted, c18 is the correct move i believe.]
;B[df];W[bc];B[bb];W[ab];B[cb];W[da];B[fa]C[wasted];W[db];B[ca]
;W[ba];B[fe];W[eh]C[i was supposed to build some thikness in order to attack c11

**** you are starting with some extremely weak stones and you are not really attacking, but trying to save that group that this point.  white can continue to attack and push you to the top of the board and build a lot of influence and potential territory.]
;B[ep]C[trying to isolate h4

q10 is much bigger


***** you are leaving weak groups around the board.  white has a lot of room on the bottom of the board, he could ignore and cut at f14, approach at o16, or simply extend to play q10 him/herself to break up the right side.]
;W[eo];B[fo];W[fn];B[go];W[kp]C[***** i think i would play this at L3 instead.]
;B[mp]C[*** again, i would play N3 and take away his/her base.  white is going to have to run to the center because of playing L4 on the 4th line, but with n4, white could still gain from an attachment at N3 and probably make two eyes.]

(;W[in];B[kq]C[***** a good play by black.];W[jq];B[lp];W[jp]
C[**** i would play L2 before K4.];B[ej]C[attacking c11-e12

*** i think this is almost too low.  it is not much of an attack because white can play c9 and link up with no problem.  on the other hand, the white cap at g10 is pretty severe.  it would be a tough fight and you would probably lose one of those groups (of course, the group around e14 is not looking very good anyway).    at a minimum, you need to protect the cut at e14 before you try to reduce.  also, i would start with the forcing move at e7.  then, just leave e7.  it might be useful later.]
;W[dk];B[gj];W[dj]C[***** wasted move from what i can tell.  g12 is better.]
;B[fg]C[**** good move.  white should have cut there already.  white should be able to keep those groups apart.]
;W[fh];B[gh];W[gg];B[hg]C[very bad for my c14 group.
g14 will leave my escape open];W[gf];B[ff]C[**** i can't imagine it will live now.  white plays g15 and black is sealed in with only 1 eye.]

;W[ch];B[bh];W[bi];B[cg];W[ah];B[ai];W[aj];B[ag];W[ai];B[hd]
;W[id];B[ie];W[if];B[je];W[ig]C[*** i would have pushed at k16 first.  that breaks up the ladder.  also, with k16, black will have a hard time living.]
;B[ic]C[that ladder was supposed to keep me in live.];W[hh]
;B[ij]C[I wanted to invaade opponent's teritorry and run away]
;W[gi];B[hj];W[kj]C[*** good move];B[jl];W[km]C[***** i think m8 would be better.]
;B[kk];W[lk];B[lj];W[ki];B[ll];W[mk]C[*****  i would have cut at L8.  if black captures at n9, then white plays k9 for a ko at least.]
;B[kl];W[jj]C[**** bad shape and i don't see what this accomplishes.]

***** good];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]C[***** i would play p2 to make eyes.  this move makes it hard for white to live]

C[white in corner is dead

But how he could make a succesful invasion ??

I think is possible];W[sp];B[sr]C[vital point

***** good];W[sm];B[sn];W[qs]C[**** already dead];B[on];W[ss]
;B[rr];W[jf];B[ke]
(;W[nc]C[**** this does not look like a good idea.  i would play q18.  see the variation]
;B[lc]C[**** too passive.  white should q17 and take the corner.]
;W[ne];B[qi]C[**** bad idea.  play q17 for the corner.  it also forces white to keep running.]
;W[pf];B[qf]C[to greedy
r15 better

*** i think q17 is still better.  you can connect on the left if you run into problems.]

;W[sa]C[**** as you know, you really don't have creditable ko threats for this fight  :)]
;B[sh];W[na];B[ra];W[jc];B[sd]C[considering this group bigger

**** i'm not sure that is correct.  white just took the entire left corner and left top.  you only gained the upper right corner.  you could have saved your r11 stones with q9, so you only would have lost the upper right.  now, you have lost more than twice that.]

Thank you for reviewing the game !

PS.

A last question:
Why on GTL a player is marked with three ranks ?

They are maybe on different ranking systems ?
