C[Hi!

Thx in advance for reviewing my game. I have some remarks and questions but overall feel free to point out my biggest mistakes.
Please just review for black side.

Hi Ren√©,

As usual, I will first go through the game once giving comments as I see it and then go through again giving comments with the benefit of hindsight.  I'm only a low dan player, so please remember to take anything I say with a grain of salt.


Your opponent is an overplayer.  Against such a person you need to be calm and patient, gently and constantly applying pressure until your opponent gets a group that is too heavy and then pester it while collecting points.  Simply trying to match move for move won't really work since unpunished overplays are worth more points.

The key mistakes seemed to be missing opportunities to knock your opponent off balance, and so allowing them to build strong shape while you just defended.  This came up a few times:

Failing to capitalise on white's approach in the lower right 
Over emphasising the centre and allowing white to take the upper left
Greatly over emphasising the centre and allowing white to take another half of the centre
Missing the opportunity around F2 until too late
Being too concerned with your own life when white invaded at C8]

;W[dc];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[fq]C[--
Nothing at all wrong with this move but it is against my personal style.

I dislike permitting white the shimari of the D17 corner so break it up this move with C14.  White usually responds D15.]
;W[hq]C[--
I think this is a mistake.  White has very logical development on the left and this move doesn't really fit with that, it also doesn't fit with white wanting sente to get C15.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[po]
C[--
A little greedy by white, allowing white to settle the corner while white is already constrained by R9.]
;B[np]C[--
Not my personal choice since H3 is already low.  N3 would have worked well, R5 would have been fine too.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[ok]C[--
Another greedy move, white needs to accept the awkward shape here rather than play P9.

If you play R7 or even Q7, I think this would get very unpleasant for white]
;B[pi]C[rs220675: Is this move alright?
--
A missed opportunity but otherwise ok];W[ql]
(;B[pk]C[--
I prefer hane underneath];W[pl];B[kq]C[rs220675: I kind of felt that I've got sente now, but is my move at L3 the best/good one?
--
L3 is big (locally I like K3 due to F4).  Globally, D15 or whatever there is very big, but I think this area is even bigger.  Don't underestimate P8 either.]
;W[rk];B[rj];W[ri]C[--
Interesting and tricky.  T10 or fix shape with R10...]
(;B[qj]C[rs220675: Looks like a mistake...what move instead for black? T10?]
;W[rl];B[sj];W[ce];B[pb]C[--
Don't underestimate D10 either, but I think I would go for F2]
;W[pg];B[og];W[qf];B[pe];W[qc];B[pc];W[ph];B[oh]C[rs220675: Here it gets too difficult for me to figure out if White can live somehow inside or not....

Looks possible to me];W[re];B[rc]C[rs220675: Now it seems white is dead. Is that correct? (Of course I messed it up and white lived :)) Can you show me the killing move?]

(;B[rb];W[qg];B[sf];W[se];B[lc]C[rs220675: Is that move alright? Seems too tight to my wall, but how else I could use my wall?
--
The key mistake was not capturing Q13 which would have made Q14, P13 and Q11 strong.  I'd be tempted by tenuki too, though it's a shame to lose the Q9 stones]
;W[ld];B[md];W[kc];B[le];W[lb];B[kd];W[jb]

Ok, that didn't go so well and adding stones isn't going to help.  Time to tenuki]

I don't like this at all, M5 or whatever starts to make F2 really interesting]

Now F2 is nowhere near so interesting];B[lq]C[--
Ouch, so painful to play this];W[lk];B[fr];W[fp]
(;B[es];W[gp]
(;B[lj]C[rs220675: Do you like that move? I don't know...I wanted to secure my territory there but on the other side that lead to whites territory below...maybe a too passive move?
--
It was bad.

The central territory is small (see how many points it is at the end).  The key area is splitting H3 from M5, perhaps K5?  The other really big areas are D10ish, and breaking up the upper left (perhaps at D18)]
;W[kj];B[he];W[fc];B[li]C[--
So passive :(];W[mk];B[ki];W[mj];B[ni];W[mi];B[mh];W[jj];B[ji]
;W[ij]C[--
White's central group is almost as big as yours now.  Also the top is more secure and H3 is safer.]

No, this is gote];W[jp]C[--
Now white is clearly ahead];B[hj];W[hk];B[ml];W[ll];B[gk];W[hl]
;B[gl];W[hm];B[ci]C[--
Good little sequence];W[cl]C[rs220675: I couldn't believe white played there. Can black kill here and with which moves? I let white live...:(.
--
This doesn't look easy to kill as black has so much weakness.  A better approach is to ensure that in living white loses the upper left corner]
