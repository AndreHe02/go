SQ[mc][nc][qf][qg][nq][oq]C[Coyotebd (After game): At this stage I understand a bit about what playing the 4-3 is for, but I don't understand how I should be developing as a strategy. The only stone that I think didn't do it's job was q16. Because I didn't connect out to the center successfully it gain no influence nor territory.

===========================================
At this point what you want to try and do is make a shimari.

Squares for safety.

Triangles for influence/power.

circle=ultra conservative play.

here are some move tree's, and you can see the ways in which the shimaris are usefull]

(;B[ce]C[you chose instead to attack whites corner... Not a bad idea, but not usually what I would play... lets see how It goes.]
;W[de];B[cf]C[Coyotebd (After game): I'm trying to exhange territory on the left side for white influence towards the top.

not a good trade.... influence is much more valuable than territory this early in the game. Keep that in mind.

Also, when trading territory for influence, you must consider how mch territory your getting... Usually you want to at least be making a line on the fourth line for it to be profitable.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[bc]C[now whites corner is secure, Black is low and has no influence and little points.

White however has Incredible shape, lots in influence which points at an empty part of the board (good for making cashable territory/fighting)

Your mistake was how you chose to invade..... I would have prefered a direct confrontation against the corner, siuch as D15]
;B[ed]LB[be:A][df:2][ci:1]C[Coyotebd (After game): I can't remember what I was doing with the peep. I think I was trying to steal the influence towards the top and make white small in the top left.

dont take this the wrong way... but untill your making moves that you remember, you arent making moves you understand. Dont peep unless the reason for it is clear. Doing this has resulted in a couple of bad things for black... 

1)black has two (weak) groups
2)Black has has a small weakness at A
3)black is making white stronger, by attacking his weaknesses and forcing him to patch them up.

What black wanted to do if he was going to ignore the Cut at A (which is very ignorable) Is to play either 1 Or 2. This way he establishes his own security by running for the center, or establishing a base along the side.]
;W[df]C[uh oh.... Look what happened...];B[dg]C[uh oh... look what hapened now.

you threatened to cut white, and then didnt do it when he let you? Why?]
;W[ee];B[dd]C[Coyotebd (After game): The shapes started looking heavy for white.]
;W[cc];B[fd];W[eg];B[dh];W[hd];B[ge];W[he]C[Coyotebd (After game): While I was happy with winning this fight, I'm seeing that it was reducing the strength of q16

Q16 's influence is only slightly weaker, It was actually destroyed much earlyer when you attacked the corner.]
;B[gf];W[eh];B[di];W[fe];B[ef];W[ff];B[fg];W[ef];B[fi];W[fh]
;B[gh];W[gg];B[ei];W[gd];B[fg]C[Coyotebd (After game): I'm happy with that, although g13 will hurt me later.

Why are you afraid of g13? its alone, and against and invincible shape.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pc]C[ah, now we see what white wants to do.... The fight before sared him... He wants safety]
;B[od];W[qd];B[qe]C[Coyotebd (After game): I would rather have left white take the top and build strength on the right, but that didn't happen.]
;W[rd];B[oc];W[pb];B[ob];W[nb]LB[oa:B][nd:A]TR[nc]C[Coyotebd (After game): I think because I tried to make him small in the corner, keep him seperate from the top left and build some thickness towards his territory. I imagine that the marked stones defeated my strength towards the left and left me fighting for liberties. Should I have just extended towards A? 

Nope.... There are a few moves here I like... but the top center is very invadable... no need to press in yet... I like... B!!!!]

(;B[pa];W[qa]C[playing in does not work to kill white.]
(;B[oa];W[rb];B[md]LB[of:A]TR[od][pd][qe][qf]C[Coyotebd (After game): Was this too loose? This was my biggest lost. If this group had been stronger white wouldn't have had a huge central territory later.

Not to lose... I dont understand how you let it die.... But in these instances, before  fight you want to get the point A in relation to the triangled stones.]
;W[rf];B[rg];W[nd];B[ne];W[me]C[Coyotebd (After game): How should I have responded. It seems if I fight, I lose and if I am passive I am giving too much for too little.


Crosscut then extend.]

Your groups arent doing much... Time to use them... make Big territories, and force white to fight you in them! 

A/B/C are all good places to start.

yup.... Now youve got no influence (which you spent all game building... and no territory to boot.]
