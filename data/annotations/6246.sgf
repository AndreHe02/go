C[Thanks for the time and interest you put into reviewing this game. My name is Nelson and I play in KGS as agogo. 17k is my current rank, but 19-20k is more realistic.

I've been playing go for some 6 months now, but spent most of the time playing 9x9 boards because I was too afraid of the jump to a full size board. As a consecuence my game is quite weak and lacks a whole board view. I feel like I have to learn from the beginning again.

This is the first game I've won in KGS in a good while. Komi, as I understand, should have been 0.5 and not 6.5. That, and my opponent not making some silly mistakes he did would have turned things round. Of course I also made some silly mistakes I realise about.]
;B[dd]C[About books i have a list of my favorits.
1: In the begining
2: Grated go problem vol 2-4 (vol 1 is just too simple, vol 2 might be too simple to) or most problembooks
3: attack and defence
4: Essential joseki
These books are books that i found intresting because they fit my style of play.
5: Crosscut workshop
6: Power of the starpoint
7: Sabaki


When you go to tournaments try to write down your games and ask stronger players, what did i do good and where do i need to improve. Don't ask them were you played wrong it only get you down to hear "here you played wrong" rather "this is how you should play to improve"]
;W[pp]C[When playing the opening I mostly place the stones as I feel, because I don't know more about it than "corners first, then extend to the sides".

"corners first, then extend to the sides and clash in the middle".

is what a japanese pro told me a few years back so i guess it can't be that wrong ;-)]

;W[pj]C[oki, its gonna be a fighters game. :)];B[jj];W[jc]LB[gc:A]
[hc:B][lc:C][mc:D][nc:E]C[K17 instead of the star point because I felt my stones were a bit too high.

That is some insight, I know there's a differens but i can't really point it out. Could be that K 17 makes G17 better F17 and K16 does the opposit, but i'm only guessing. High dan or pros can pinnpoint the differens.

Third line for territory and fourth line for influens is what i've heard, but what i feel that is important here is only to know what usually happens when your opponent attacks at A-B to maybe get a pincer or C-E for cutting and maybe aim for the corner, not what the actuall differens of K16 or K17 are.]

(;B[qq]C[I tried to deal with this invasion as best as I could, exchanging the corner for influence. I didn't make much use of it later, though.

First of all, this is way to early for black... and if he has to make a 3-3 invasion for *****!!! sake choose R17 and after the dust settles push hard against the wall to reduce point for white. (see ex in previus move)

This invasion always lives when its the open. When there are stones, black or white around M3-O3 and R6-R8 things can get complicated. 
There are some basic variation that one should know about this invasion, and if we put in the M3-O3, R6-8 thing to the variations... Ehh No, lets not go in there we might not get out again ;-)
I do actually use them from time to time, my only problem is that it's seldom i who chosen them...
Because when you make the 3-3 invasion as it's called, you'll live but it's your opponent who chooses how.]

(;W[pq]LB[jp:C][qp:B][pq:A]C[B is better for white, get a lot more help from Q10.
Playing A forces you to build on what you dont have, aka after the wall is there you have to use your sente to play around C.
With alt B the "C" move is already there.
By choosing A i thought you where going to take the corner and force black to run out into middle.


I use to think that i could make territory on the sides as long as i played the starpoints... It took many,many games to understand that i was wrong and even more game to change my thinking about the starpoints. San-ren-sai or the starpoint opening is not one to choose if you want to base your game on territory. It is actually a fightingbased opening.]

;W[oq];B[sn]C[empty triangel, 1 line move and gote....  Hm, wonder if there's any good with this move.

I did find some complications with the R7 cut but none that where favorable for black. Though i didn't look to hard. (Don't study them, i just played them to give you the ide on what to look for)]

(;W[sm]LB[sm:A][jp:B]C[Play B.
A is tiny, and about 100 moves or so to early.];B[sp]
(;W[pm]LB[pm:A][qm:B]C[Q7 to protect the cut at r
R7 and because I thought it would work well with Q10. I tend to play often like this to protect cuts instead of just linking another stone. Sometimes it hasn't been such a good idea because it has led me to lose initiative in a fight to link them.

While playing I thought this group to be pretty thick. Now I'm not so sure about it, because of the cutting point at q5.

Best protection against the R7 cut is to play R7 it also makes Q5 pointless for black, though P5 if black gets a big centergroup or something can be annoying.]
;B[mn]C[This came quicker than I had thought.

Black is obviously terrified of letting you get territory. H4 to L-M4 for black is better though that's like asking white to invade.

M8 is a good cuttingpoint when you get a group on the lowre edge.]

(;W[fq]LB[nk:B][fq:A]C[I think I was trying to bite as much area at the bottom as I could. The black stone in tengen made me very uncomfortable. Now I think I would have played K4 or better L6 to make use of my strong group.

Not at all, looking for territory this is where i would play.

J3 should give you life, when this open i can't imagine it dying...

If you were thinking that the bottom was points you are like na, dream on...It never happens that area is just to big.]
;B[hq]
(;W[fo]C[Tried to run into the center.

With tengen that not the best ide. Rather play C3, but the way Black answerd is i bit of surprise to me. Made 2 variations of what i sort of expect at my level.]

(;W[ho]LB[ho:A][gq:B]C[Sacrificed F3 to build towards the center. And give up some 18+ points and a exelent attack on the corner later.

NO.... Connect with G3 and make H3 so week black has to do something if he wants it... 
Played some moves to give you an ide on what to aim for after G3.

Think you can sum this advise up as : Cut your opponent when you can and keep him separated.
There's a saying that if you got only one group on the whole board you will win 8 of 10 games. And the more groups you get the higer the odds that one or more groups will die.
Thumrule:
5 groups, 1 group should die
6 groups, 1 or more will die and most likely cost you the game
7 +  groups = give up....];B[gq]
(;W[jp]C[When I made this extension I didn't expect as much resistance as it came.

This is asking to be cut, play J5 if you wanna avoid getting cut. The atari at H4 scews things up for white.]

;W[go];B[ip];W[in];B[jn];W[im];B[mk];W[fc]C[Maybe I left the bottom of the board too soon, but I thought things to be reasonably flexible down there, and wanted to develop a bit here.

yes you need to play at G7 for a tiny chance of to eyes and then G10 to run. if you after that get the chance to play J9 your 2 eyes shouldn't be a problem. but i do think black will have something to say about this dreamplay form white.... ;-)]

Don't try to kill your opponent by chasing him to death, but kill him by not allowing him eyespace. If you presure from distans and push harder and harder his eyespace is gonna get smaller and smaller until *poff* gone.

Those three things together would have been enough to turn things round if komi was 0.5 as it should.

S2 - removes ko-threats, but that's all it does...

J1 - If black doesn't play j1 there's a ko, but as late in the game as it was a kind of pointless ko...

B17 - White c17 can make it uggly for black. a somewhat slow but safe move for black, not sure the timing is 100% right though. A bit late maybe.]

C is also playble for white, C can in rare cases become a ko-threat for black. I think it has happen like 1 or 2 in a 100 games or so for me, so it's really rare.]

A good, really good fighter might get 15-25 of them but iv'e found by experience that if one has more then 70 point one usually win. And with this secure position white can give black a really bad headache....

This is osly a good example of how 2 josekis work together even though ther is a whole board in between. if you wanna find out how good this is for white start as black anywhere on line N to T and try to reduce whites territory by more then 25 points against a stronger player.]
