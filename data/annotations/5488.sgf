AB[pd][dp]C[G : Hello, I am Giroro and play as black. Komi is 6.5. I have written a few comments of my own, but please comment on whatever you feel is worth talking about. Thanks a lot.

z -- Hi, I am Bill, "zinger" in the internet Go community.  My comments are marked with "z --".  I will be happy to review your game.  Remember that I am also a weak amateur, and have probably made a few mistakes.  In fact, I think we are close enough in strength that you should consider my ideas as differences of opinion, rather than as instruction, and evaluate them for yourself.

z -- I prefer to reference move numbers and board markings rather than grid coordinates.  Hopefully your sgf reader displays these properly.  I recommend Drago, which I used to make the review.

z -- This was a close game - only 2.5 points (or maybe 3.5 - see last comment).  Therefore, it would be easy to pick some spots where you lost a few points, and say these are the reason.  I did point a few such things out (30, 148, 166, to name a few), but I think the main focus of this review should be positional judgement.  From 26-36 or so, you seemed dissatisfied with black's result, based on your comments.  But I think black got a splendid result.  Also you seemed to give white more credit than he deserved for his area of influence in the lower right, whereas I was thinking of it as porous and ripe for invasion.  In particluar, even after white 55 there was a good invasion point left that you seemed to overlook.  In the end your reluctance to invade allowed almost the whole area to become white territory.]
;W[oo];B[cd];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj];B[ed];W[fq];B[cn]TR[oo][pj]LB[dn:a]
C[z -- I think that black 8 at A would work better with the enclosure in the top left.  It would also have more effect toward the center, which looks like it will be important in this game due the the high position of the marked white stones.]
;W[cl]
(;B[dr]LB[ci:a][cj:b]C[z -- white 9 look like an overplay, but black 10 is a submissive answer.  I think black 10 at A or B would be better.]
;W[jp]C[G : question on my mind : what is the time and place to enter white's framework?

z -- Later.  White cannot make the lower right into territory with one move, so it is OK to wait.  You are right that you should do it eventually - but in this game you never did.]
;B[cj]C[z -- good move.];W[rd];B[ej]LB[qc:A]C[G : solid play at A better?

z -- 14 at A would be OK, but this 14 is also good.];W[lc];B[qc]
;W[rc];B[me]LB[ne:a]C[G : now I'm not happy about having to play this

z -- It's OK to defend here, but I would prefer the soild move, 18 at A.]
;W[ic];B[fo];W[hp];B[gc];W[ie];B[jd];W[hb];B[id]LB[gb:A]C[G : A would score quite some points, and white would not be settled yet anyway.

z -- I think 26 at A would be wrong - an endgame move in the opening!  White 25 looks like a mistake, and 26 looks like a good punishment.  There is a proverb about connecting against a peep, and white disregarded it.]
;W[fb];B[hc]LB[gb:a]C[z -- I think black might as well push in at A first, then play 28 (minor quibble).]
;W[gb]
(;B[jc]LB[ib:a]C[z -- black could tie white up tighter with 30 at A.]
;W[ib];B[he]LB[jb:a]C[G : I may be too focused on my left framework.

z -- not at all !  This is an excellent result for black.  White picks away for a few measly points on the edge, while black builds glorious outer influence and retains the potential to rake in a nice harvest of points with A.  Black should be very pleased, and white should be regretting 25.  And black could have done even better, at move 30.]
;W[dc];B[dd];W[cc];B[hn]C[G : but now that i've come this far, I insist on it

z -- Good move, the boundary between two moyos.  Black is further ahead than at move 1.]
;W[pq]LB[ql:a][lp:b]C[G : and white is scoring points

z -- Phooey on white's points.  Black's influence dominates the game.  This means it will be easy for black to invade at A, B, or almost anywhere he wants.]
;B[jn]LB[ql:a]C[z -- If I were black, I would invade now at A instead of 38.  But objectively 38 looks OK too, still on the boundary of two moyos.]
;W[lo];B[lj]LB[kj:a][kk:b]C[z -- trying to close the moyo is a reasonable idea, but 40 makes poor shape with 38.  Maybe A or B instead would keep white out more effectively.]
;W[kl];B[ln];W[lh];B[mo];W[mp];B[ko];W[lp];B[kp]C[z -- bad stlye in my opinion.  Don't push in if you're not going to cut.  I would play 48 at 50.]
;W[kq];B[mn];W[jo];B[kn];W[ml];B[nj];W[ol]
(;B[jj]LB[jk:a]C[z -- I think black 56 should be at A.];W[il]
;B[pi];W[oi];B[oj];W[pk];B[ph];W[of];B[nh]C[z -- still a good result for black.  Now white's top right group is insecure.]
;W[mf];B[lf];W[mg];B[ne];W[og];B[oh];W[jh];B[li];W[jf]
(;B[gl]LB[qn:a]C[z -- I think now is the time to invade at A.]
;W[hl];B[gk];W[in];B[im];W[io]
(;B[jl]LB[jm:a]C[z -- I think 80 should be at A.  This is the 1-2-3 principle: often it is better to omit 1 and 2 (80 and 81 here) and just play 3 (82).]
;W[jk];B[jm]TR[jk][jl]C[z -- the marked exchange favors white.  In effect, it's another push-in without a cut.]
;W[kk];B[hm];W[kj];B[ki];W[ji]
(;B[kh]LB[mh:a]C[z -- I think 88 is wrong - black loses a liberty.  Just playing A directly is better.  This is the 1-2-3 principle again.]
;W[kg];B[mh];W[lg];B[qg]LB[qn:a][lk:b]C[z -- the exchanges 92-97 damage the viability of the invasion at A.  I think it is better just to play B immediately.]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[rj];B[qh];W[qj];B[rf];W[qe];B[on]LB[bc:A]C[G : A bigger?

z -- 100 is OK - definitely sente.];W[rh];B[rg];W[si];B[lk]
;W[ll];B[ni]LB[mk:a]C[z -- living with A instead of 106 is a few points better.]
;W[mk]C[z -- ouch, 2 free points for white.  He only won by 2.5 !]
;B[mj];W[pn]
(;B[gh]C[G : now i don't even follow up P6. Don't know what I am thinking. If this one is bigger I should have played it first I guess

z -- there looks like a truckload of aji in white's lower right corner.  I would try something there.]
;W[ke]
(;B[kd]LB[ld:a]C[z -- 112 should be at A.  But white returns the favor ...]
;W[ld];B[le];W[jb]LB[kb:a]C[z -- ... by playing 115 instead of A, which would give black a tricky life and death problem.]
;B[lb];W[hf]
(;B[kb]LB[gf:a]C[z -- 118 is not necessary - A is better.];W[ge]
C[z -- this is painful.]
(;B[ff]C[z -- I think 120 should connect the atari, since white's capture there is sente anyway.]
;W[hd];B[mc];W[fe]C[G : best way to resist? This made me lose quite a lot of points in the end

z -- it is tricky now.  I think your play is OK.];B[ef];W[ee]
;B[de];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[po]LB[no:a]C[z -- fancy footwork - but does it work if white answers at A?]
;W[pp];B[pm];W[qo];B[om];W[qm];B[pl];W[ql];B[ij];W[ok];B[np]
TR[on][om][pm][pl]LB[gp:a][no:b]C[z -- 140 is a dangerous kind of move - it loses two points, and the four stones will be left behind to capture.  Later you had to fix this, which cost a move.  I think A first is better; if white answers as in the game, you can play B in sente, then follow through from A.]
;W[no];B[gp]C[G : now this is all I came up with to use O4 aji. What is better?

z -- looks OK to me.];W[iq];B[gq];W[gg];B[fh];W[cf]
(;B[df]LB[ce:a]C[z -- I think it is safe to connect at A.];W[bf]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[bh];W[ce];B[ag];W[ae];B[ch];W[hi];B[hr]C[z -- good yose attitude ...]
;W[hj]
(;B[jr]LB[ks:a]C[z -- ... but the monkey jump to A is bigger than 160.]
;W[ir];B[is];W[kr];B[nn]C[z -- painful.  Black loses a whole move.]
;W[jq];B[js]LB[rb:a]C[z -- A in the top right  is bigger that 166.]
;W[ks];B[hs];W[hq];B[fr];W[ho]
(;B[go]LB[rb:a]C[z -- bad yose attitude.  A is still bigger.]
;W[je];B[kc];W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[rb];B[hh]LB[fc:a][ec:b]
[eb:c][gd:d]C[G : this is definitely a crap move. I guess A is better. The game was really close at this point (I end up losing by 2.5 points)

z -- I'm not so sure that 180 is a mistake.  It's worth about five points.  The best way to fix the defect at A is with B-C-D.  As a bonus, it's atari.]
