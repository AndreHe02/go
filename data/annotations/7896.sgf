This shape is played as a trick play, otherwise is usualy not good.]

(;B[cl]C[I'm not sure about it...
What if I cut?

Unless you can kill the bottom group, this direction of play is pointless. You only gave white a lot of profit on the left and the wall you built wasn't very usefull.

You should probably cut, but white also gets something in return, so it's not so clear. Maybe it would be best to tenuki and decide later.]
