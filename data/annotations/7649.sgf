AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hello,

I played this game as Black on KGS.
I put some comments and questions on 6, 20, 21, 39, 48, 70, 84 and 106.

Thank you for reviewing my game...];W[nq]
(;B[qn];W[fq];B[cn];W[jp]C[>>> 
Here W is still thin.];B[er]C[I dont realy know about that. I think it give more to black than to white but I not sure.

>>>

I'm also not sure, but I feel like black had a loss here.];W[fr]
;B[eq];W[fo];B[or];W[nr];B[oq];W[no]C[>>> 
Now W is thick.
This will limit your choices in the future.];B[jc];W[qf]
(;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[ph];B[qj]C[Mistake, B20 should probably be at R9 to avoid invasion...

>>>

No, here is better. Q12 was the mistake, he should've played R11.]
;W[ql]C[I thought I could manage the invasion but it turn bad for me.
What should I do in such case? Try to kill R8 as I did or running in the center with R10?]
(;B[pk];W[pl]C[>>>

You are pushing towards your own stones, you should just jump out.]

This was a really, really bad move.];W[je];B[hq]C[I did not respond to K15, I have the feeling this was a realy big mistake...

>>> 

Yes it is.];W[ip];B[gr];W[hp];B[gq];W[gp];B[hs];W[es];B[ds]
;W[fs];B[gs];W[fp];B[cr];W[lc];B[mb]C[I m not sure about this response. Afterward, I think something begining with L16 should be better. Is cutting white at L16 better?

>>>

At first I tought it was a bad idea, but after some reading it looks not. A fight here would reduce white's influence in the middle.]

C[Try to invade but I m very bad at that. Anyway, with all white strength around I not sure it is even possible...

>>>

It's not you. It was the place you chose. Next time, try invading near his influence's border, where the triangles are.]
