C[Hallo!

I just won this game because my opponent did a horrendous mistake at the end. Just review for black. I have no detailed questions since I want you to just review the game and point out mistakes that "jump on you". But you can focus on fuseki and middle game since it's there where kyu's like me do the heavy mistakes.

Thx very much in advance, I appreciate your effort.

[kb\]: I will do my best.  I am not so strong, so hopefully my comments are helpful ;)

You made many directional mistakes in the opening, but your opponent played slowly in the middle game, so you were able to make up the gap.  In the end, it was a close game.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ec];W[qf]
(;B[nc]TR[ec]C[[kb\]: This should at least be played high, for balance.

You may also think about a pincer, since the top left stone is already low and solid.]
;W[pj]
(;B[cn]C[[kb\]: This move makes it too obvious for White to pincer.

You should simply extend directly.];W[dk]C[Black needs to jump and separate.]

[ec]C[White got a good result here.  The joseki result on the lower left is equal, but:

1) The White pincer does much to nullify Black's possibilities on the left.

2) The White thickness works well with White's hoshi stone on the right.]
;B[nq];W[lq]
(;B[qq]C[[kb\]: Even locally, but it is the wrong direction globally, since there are so many White stones in the region.]
