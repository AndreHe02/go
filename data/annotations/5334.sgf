C[Hello,
I played white in this game, which I lost badly.
I had many weak groups and black was thick.
A bad combination :)

Could you please help my opening and middle game. I think I didnt play many 
very bad moves but something was lacking in my whole board thinking.

Thanks for reviewing.


You are welcome.];B[dp];W[pq];B[pc];W[qe];B[oe];W[qh]C[Is this playable here 
?



Yes should be fine.];B[dc];W[de];B[fd];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[eb]
;W[ci]C[I've seen C12 by strong players, which 
would be best here. Or is it style?


Just style.];B[po];W[qm];B[np]C[This is bad for black in my opinion



I think this is at least an ok move.
Since white has more stones on right side, it's a good choice for black to 
go to another direction.];W[qo];B[pp];W[qp];B[oq];W[qq];B[pn]
MA[qh][qm]C[R12, R7 both low and not a good combination, 
so I think black not bad.];W[cn]C[good direction ?



Not bad.];B[cl];W[fq];B[dn];W[mq]C[Can I play this first before corner?


You can.];B[nr];W[dm];B[en]C[C7];W[cq]C[C7 is a choice.];B[cm]
;W[dq];B[co];W[ip]C[J4 has good 
feel for me.
Now I think white is acceptable and can play a good game



Yes];B[qd];W[kc]LB[kd:a][ke:b]CR[pe]C[Any ideas, this is good bad idea

Hard to say, I'd play a bit higher, easier to escape to center.
Q15 is the shape,];B[mc];W[hc];B[jd];W[jc];B[id];W[hd];B[dg]
;W[cg];B[df];W[cf];B[ee];W[dh];B[dd];W[kd]C[This move is perhaps bad and lets black get sente?


This move is ok.
C15 connect is big, should C15.];B[ce];W[be]C[White lose too much here.]

(;B[if];W[kf]C[K14 better ?


I think both ok.];B[qj]C[Before, white Q10 looks good instead of L16 ?



I think C15 connect was bigger than both.];W[pi]LB[oh:a]C[I have not any 
good idea of continuations here


Q11 is fine, Q15 is shape, or P12.
Whatever, just go to center is ok. or try make 2 
eyes.];B[pj];W[oj]CR[ni]C[maybe overplay, u leave P11 cut.
I'd O11 jump to center good shape.];B[pl];W[oi];B[qn];W[rn]
;B[ql];W[rl]C[I wanted to tenuki but S8 seemed very big.



S7 better, u may Q7 then cut black.];B[og];W[re];B[hq];W[iq]
;B[hp];W[hr]C[H5 
better?



I think so.];B[gr];W[ir];B[gq];W[fr];B[fs];W[es];B[gs];W[dr]

bad.];B[im];W[fo];B[gn];W[gm];B[fn];W[il];B[jl];W[kn];B[jo]

White should just escape and no need to sacrifice these four stone.

die.];B[jp];W[kq];B[mp];W[kr];B[nq];W[he];B[jf];W[gg];B[kg]

can survive but it is almost certainly too late now ?



White lose too many stones in center and get nothing back, and with B14 cut 
I think black is winning anyway.];B[ic];W[ib];B[gb];W[hb];B[ke]

C[Black still 
has the n8, n9, m7 ...
to cut off some stones ?

After the opening I think white still had a good game but the middle game I 
made some bad choices.
Please help as I would like some comments to improve.
Thank you,
