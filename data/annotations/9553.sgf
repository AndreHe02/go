AB[pd][dp]C[T : Hi, I'm Tilwen, my comments will start with "T".]
;W[pp];B[cc];W[dd]C[ts: B2 at 3-3 looked like very territorial to me. I don't know any josekis apart from few simplest in corner and 3-3 invasion, but I thought, it is my chance. Is this mistake by B? Is my approach given this situation viable?

T : At this point, I guess anything is playable. This move aims for influence, nothing bad in it.]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[cd];W[df]
(;B[ch]C[ts: Are stones in top left settled? It is still hard for me determine this correctly. I didn't find any severe way to attack those, so tenukied.

T : Here I really feel you miss a point : black overextend, you shouldn't allow him to connect. A move like C15 separates his stones and feels rather sente (corner would get enclosed if black tenukies). In the beginning, what really matters is how your groups interact. See variation.]

(;W[nc];B[oc]C[ts: B10 is mistake, I think - touching weak stone. I have read somewhere, that this move is not mistake, if you want to make opponent stones heavy and attack. Would this play by B be correct, if he would attack on his next move?

T : Yes, P17 is a mistake in this situation. It aims at attacking, but here white gets settled very asily.]
;W[nd]
(;B[hc]C[T : Again, Black overextends from D17, and again you probably don't want him to be able to connect. The more group he has, the more possibilitites you get to take advantge on him in a fight. An important thing when there are many different groups like here : FIRST take care ofyour own groups, then aim at attacking.
  In this situation, you have two potentially weak groups, but I feel like O17 can either extend to L17 and get a base or put pressure on Q16 and be safe, so I would just seprate at E17.]

(;W[gd];B[kc];W[le]C[ts: He attacked after all. Hmm, I planned to secure bases and then try to attack. Let's count my bases... 0 (apart from lonely stone in the corner). Do I do something wrong here or this is called "going for influence"?

T : What you probably didn't see is that Black too has zero base, which means you have a lot of sente moves to defend yourself while aiming at attacking in an other place (see the kind of move I showed in the previous variation). And as your two group have access to the center, they are about safe. In this situation, I would be afradi about the L17 and H17 stones, they will need to make passively two eyes and doing nothing else. In the meantime White will get something.]
;B[pg];W[qi]C[ts: Start creating base, threaten to slide under B stone, jump out, if B will pincers.

T : I guess this is possible, but it makes another group and makes things even more complicated. Now you'll have to think about all your groups, which will be an hard job !]
;B[qh]C[ts: Same play as before. Do I miss the point?];W[pi]
C[T : Feels great for white, Black's corner is very wea will White gets stronger.]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[rp]
(;W[on]C[ts: I decided to give corner, thinking, that B would play at W23 himself.

T : I feel like this move is not so right, it's not bad to take influence, but you can do better here, see variation.]
;B[qq];W[pq];B[qr];W[mq]C[ts: Is W27 correct extention or should be larger?

T : This extension is quitey small in himself (you can go up to K3 probably with Q4 and P6, and here it's only about points, because P6 links your groups. In the opening points are not very important, what matter is the strength and weaknesses of the groups (that's the meaning of "urgent moves before big moves"). Instead, C6 looks rather big, or I would probably play something in the upper left first (C15 and following probably, maybe E18 or F18 which aims at attacking two groups). I really like White's position just before N3, but now you give sente to Black, in a fighting game sente is very important (one move makes the difference between a strong group and a weak one for instance)]
;B[pm];W[pl];B[om]
(;W[qo]C[ts: I see this as sente move before playing at S7, is that good plan?

T : The question is, why do you see that S17 is good for you ? It's on the second line, which is usually not so good in the beginning. In order to defend your group you should rather play something like O9 or O12, which aims at connectin with M15 and enclosing Q16 (se variation).]
;B[ro];W[pn]C[ts: Don't know what hit me, to make this move, when I've should just expand eyespace of right side group. Does it seem like big mistake to you too?]
;B[qm]C[ts: Now it is to late...

T : I don't thing your moves are very bad (it doesn't really hrt your position), it's more about being not so useful and removing aji.]
;W[nm]C[T : This is the wrong direction. You have N3 in place so your lower group is VERY alive, and Black's corner is alive too. The only weak group is your right group, and with O7 you force Black into making it weaker, which is exactly what he wants, not a good idea.]
;B[rk];W[rl];B[ri]
(;W[fp]C[ts: I'm making big move before urgent and will pay for that.

T : Exactly, defending the right side is urgent.];B[ol];W[ok]
;B[nl]
(;W[mm]C[T : N7 is small (see variation).]
(;B[nk];W[ni];B[pk];W[qk];B[oj];W[pj];B[oi];W[ok];B[rj];W[oh]
;B[nj];W[ph]C[ts: I feel, that B can punish me more, but can't find a way (please see variations).

T : Black can defend his corner in sente, it's quite good for him. As the lower right Black group is already alive, the O8 O9 and O10 stones are rather useless, Black should have split white in two in order to attack (see variation at move 44).]

(;B[og];W[nh];B[rm];W[lh]C[ts: Made it out!

T : Yeah, Black S7 is very small, connecting two alive groups.]
;B[rg];W[je]C[ts: Attack weak stones while connecting (almost), but are those stones weak indeed? What do you think?

T : Very good point !];B[gc];W[fc];B[lb];W[nb];B[ld]
(;W[cn]C[ts: It appeared as my O18-16 stones can be connected to main force, so I tenukied. As I now explored some variations, I see, that I was wrong. Are there some fundamental relations of stones, based on which I can judge if I'm connected? Because it would be imposible to read it out.

T : Well, there is no magic in go, sorry, reading is your only tool :) . I feel connecting at N15 is sente (see variation), but you must realize that even if you end gote, while Black did very few points on the upper side and even lose some on the upper left and right corner, you made your group stronger : this is a gain for you.]

(;B[cq];W[cj]C[ts: Should be at C9? I want to put more presure at C12 stone so made larger extention.


T : This feels OK to me, you probably should play the C15 sequence first.]
;B[cf]C[T : Black connects and makes things easier for him.]

(;W[dg];B[cg];W[ei];B[cl]C[ts: And here is the price of larger extention. Was it big mistake?

T : You made influence and Black invaded, normally you should be able to get benefit while attacking. But the situation here is complicated : Black can link at B10 and the moyo isn't that solid, on the other hand the lower left corner may become weak ... Hard to find the best move to attack here.]

(;W[dl]TR[cj][cl][cn]C[ts: Is touching here a mistake?

T : There are some joseki sequences for this invasion (triangle stones). When there is "no other stone", D8 is a sacrifice move which aims at connecting from the other side. I'm not sure it's the best idea here (see variation for possibilities, but the situation is complicated).]
;B[dm];W[cm];B[dk]
(;W[el];B[ck]C[T : The thing is that E8 is not good for white, because he is cut in too many different groups.]

(;W[dj]C[ts: Simply at E9 would be much better, is that right? Was this loosing move? I have tried some variations and didn't find anything MUCH better for B that in game, but W81 just feels wrong to me.

T : Yeah E9 seem better, but D7 still makes his cutting job, E8 (and before that D8 in fact) did not work here. The point is, now Black can save his group with D6 at anytime he wants, and if white takes the D7 stone (if he can, it's not even sure), Black has one move to defend himself. Moyo will probably disappear in any case and game starts to be over for white.]
;B[ek]
(;W[fk];B[fj];W[gk];B[ej];W[fi];B[di];W[gj];B[bj];W[dh];B[ci]

(;W[lk]C[ts: Big mistake again, I think. We are not finished fighting at left side, as my opponent showed me. Was E7 correct?

T : E7 gives points away again, D6 is better.];B[en]C[T : C6 is gone here, the only thing you can defend is the moyo.]

(;W[eo];B[fl];W[fm];B[em];W[gl];B[fn];W[el];B[dl]C[T : Useless ^^.]
;W[fl]C[T : Very polite from you, one useless move for one useless move :-) .]
;B[do]C[T : Black has too many points and moyo is mostly gone, game is over here. I hope my comments made you see things you didn't realize earlier, feel free to ask me more questions !
