AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[E: Hello. My comments starts with 'E' (Emoticon) character.

First, the question you asked me by e-mail. I don't know W played some of the strange move he played. My guess is the lack of experience) Well, we all been like that.

I'd like to point out main points, which should help you to become stronger.
1. Always ask yourself why you play this one hand and what does it achieve for you.
2. Learn to distinguish key stones, which accomplished some task of strategic value from expendable ones.
3. Pay attention to whether move leaves you with innitiative (sente) or you have to pass it  to the opponent (gote).
4. Practice. As far as I can tell by this match, you're still not comfortable with 19x19 board. Smaller boards are better to build initial experience, since you see consequences of your actions earlier and have lesser space to be lost in.]
;W[jp];B[jd];W[ko];B[cn];W[ln];B[cf];W[mm];B[og]C[E: Too high for this phase of game. I would prefer to make on of corners solid. (3-3 point invasions are possible, for now  - all four of them)]
;W[nl]C[E: White made 4 moves that doesn't really make sense.]
;B[om]C[E: What's the idea? If it's to defend, this move should be one line lower.

Contact play usually leadst o mutual strengthening. If it was the idea, your next move omitted it.]
;W[ok];B[ne];W[oj];B[qj]C[E: Better at Q11 or Q9.
R10 has no other benifits.
(It doesn't put pressure on opponent's group, doesn't make good extension and so on)]
;W[oi]
(;B[pi]TR[pj][qj]C[E: Bad. The marked form, called empty triangle is ineffective. (Compare it to three in row, which has more dame, in this case, problem was caused by hand at R10)
One point jump is way better here, since it disallows deep intrusions into your territory.]
;W[ph]
(;B[pg]C[E: I would block at P12. It would be very hard for lone W stone to survive, but you should be aware of weakness around Q8.]
;W[oh];B[qh];W[pk]
(;B[pl]C[E: Sacrificing empty triangle here and blocking the path would be better.
Learn to distinguish key stones (ones that accomplish on or more tasks like keeping opponent away or holding large chunk of territory) from expendable ones.
I woul treat empty triangle as expendable here.];W[qk];B[qg]
;W[rj];B[qi]SQ[ql][qm][qn][rn][sn][ri][rh][sh]C[E: This is estimated directions and radius of chaos that might be invoked by penetrating W string.]

(;B[mq]C[E: Why don't simply capture after Q3?];W[or];B[mr]
;W[ms];B[ls];W[lr];B[lq];W[ks];B[jq]C[E: Not good. W can simply cut it.
Connecting your weak groups and cutting opponent's is essential in go.]
(;W[kr];B[kq];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr];B[hq];W[is];B[jr]C[E: W is collecting weak points. :)]
;W[kp]
(;B[lp]C[E: it's better to connect two of your groups, so that they can fight together.
This one move gets you nothing new.];W[lo];B[mo];W[mn];B[nn]
;W[nm];B[ip]C[simon2010 [19k\]: lol];W[io];B[ho];W[gn];B[go]
;W[jn];B[fo]C[E: It's better to either play actively at F6 or Enclose corner, for example, by simply playing C3.
You can afford playing more active and agressive when you have strong position and this position is really strong.]
;W[fm]
(;B[gm]C[E: It's better to reduce W's framework here. See comment to move 81.]
;W[gl];B[hm];W[im];B[hn];W[hl];B[fn];W[in];B[em];W[fl]SQ[fm]
[gl][hl][im][in][io][jn][fk][gj][ii][kh][lg][ng][jp][ko][ln]
[mm][nl][ok][oj][oi][oh][hj][mg][ji]C[E: You go a chunk of territory, W built additional thickness. His profit here more than yours.
A good idea would be to reduce W's framework (the marked one).]
;B[fk];W[fj]C[LHM1948 [28k\]: hi and thank you];B[ek];W[ej]
C[simon2010 [19k\]: for what];B[ei]TR[dk][di]C[E: Marked points are point where your groups can be cut. That's what happened in actual game. Don't create them needlessly.]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[dl];B[dm];W[el];B[gk]
(;W[hk]C[E: W's mistake.];B[gj];W[gi];B[hj]C[E: Just capture at H11 instead. Simple mistakes like this often costs most.]
;W[hi];B[fi];W[gj];B[eh]TR[ei][fi]C[E: Again. Empty triangle.
It's better to defend at C10. See variation for W's net move.]

(;B[qe]C[E: Why not Q14?];W[pf];B[qf]C[E: White succesfully built you a wall.]
;W[qp];B[qc]C[E: Not the best point here, but for handicapped game securing your advantage is a good choice and rare one.
As well as for non-handicapped one.

I pointed out some points that would hurt W in variations. Those points were already present for some time by now.]
;W[pq]
(;B[rd]MA[cl][cc][cq][gr]C[E: Way too defensive. Especially since it's second hand in a row here.
It would be very hard for W to survive after W S16.
B J 13 or O13 would be a lot better.
If you look which points to defend, chose the must vulnerable ones.
Here it can be one of the marked points.];W[qm];B[pc];W[ql]
;B[lc]SQ[nn][oo][on][om][pm][pl]C[E: oddly enough no one spotted that fact that marked group is in atari. 10 free points)]
;W[md];B[mc];W[oc];B[nd];W[ob];B[pb];W[ep];B[nb];W[do]
(;B[oa]C[E: Bad. W is already dead and it's bad idea to not support your corner stones.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[dq];B[cm];W[bp];B[cl];W[ap];B[dn]SQ[ao][bo]C[E: How much does this move costs and what does it achieve?
Looks like zero points with loss of temp.
Protecting your territory with move like B5 worth a lot more.]
;W[dp];B[en];W[gq];B[fp];W[fq];B[eo]C[simon2010 [19k\]: w is catching up

E: One more move that gets nothing. Groups were already connected and thsi move applies no pressure on W. See comment for move 156.]
;W[eq];B[bo]C[E: Good.];W[gr]
(;B[ao]C[E: You enclosed this part of territory, but the move is small. Let's see what happens if you take some of bigger points instead.]
;W[hs];B[fh];W[js]C[E: white spent two moves to connect groups both of which are strong and unconditionally alive.]
;B[ri]C[E: Big point.];W[rk];B[si];W[ns];B[ci];W[gc];B[gd];W[fb]
;B[fc];W[hb];B[ga];W[ha]C[simon2010 [19k\]: secure the corner at top left]
;B[fa];W[ea];B[eb];W[gb];B[da];W[fa]C[simon2010 [19k\]: what is black doing]
;B[hc]TR[db][ec]C[E: Marked points are cut points here. White could try to wreak chaos and get another eye.]

simon2010 [19k\]: white is seprated];W[la];B[lb];W[jf];B[jc]
C[E: Unnecessary. It would be better to reduce at O13 or H14, or connect at O5.]
