No need to be sad. You've won the game. 

You're opening has you mentioned wasn't great. And you made some simple mistakes, probably because you were rusty. Overall, you played better than your opponent. 

Your opponent made quite a few unnecessary defensive plays, and ommited some important moves as well. 

You also made quite a few errors as well, such as the connection at

b3. 

I would suggest doing some life and death problems and studying some opening theory. 

Learning a particular opening really well such as the Chinese, Mini Chinese, or Kobyashi would help you. Sanrensei is fun as well. 

Good luck.
