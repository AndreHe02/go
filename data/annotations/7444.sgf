C[Hi, My name is Thomas, I'll be reviewing your game. I was approxiamtely 6k. Though i haven't played for a few months, i started to play again recently. I'm only around 10k i guess, so most of my propositions are probably not the best (or i would be 8d) but hopefully it will help you get a better understanding of your weaknesses, and strengths.
Concerning this game:
I think you should take some time to think about the purpose of your moves. You played some moves that show you can have a good vision of the game. However you often play moves that lead you to destroy your own territory.
You need to think about how linked your groups are. You often leave your groups full of cutting points. Ask yourself: Can my opponent cut? And if he cuts, is it dangerous for my groups, and my territory?

Every time i proposed a variation i wrote See var. unless i say it explicitely.]

(;B[pd]C[See Var.];W[pp];B[pj];W[dj];B[jp];W[jd];B[jj]C[It's a weird start. See previous variation to see how the "star" point opening is usually played.
This move calls for an invasion in the top left. Playing a move like this is like saying "let's fight." Moreover you played influence oriented moves so far.]
;W[qm]
(;B[rk]C[This move seems a little low compared to the previous moves.

See var.];W[mq];B[lq];W[fq]C[White ignored your answer and played elsewhere, instead of answering his last move, you could take advantage of this. You don't have to play contact moves. Playing a less agressive can serve multiple purposes.]

;B[gq];W[hp];B[hq];W[iq];B[fr];W[eq]TR[lq][jp]MA[go][gn]C[In the lower left area, you already have four different groups. With just 10 stones, it's a lot.
You need to play moves according to the stones that are already on the board. Make use of them. And always worry about the state of your different groups.
Here, you can secure the lower left corner by capturing E3 F3. But your two triangled stones are in great danger! The X stones are not as cornered as the triangled ones, but their future looks gloomy.
It's ok to sacrify some stones if you gain something in exchange. For example, let your triangled stones alone for now, and secure your lower left corner.]
;B[dq];W[hr];B[er];W[kr]TR[lq][jp]C[If we stop and take a look at the situation here, you exchanged your two triangled stones for a very big corner. Only the F5 stone is a bit troublesome but you can seal it with a move at E6, for example.]

(;B[ec]C[This is not the best way to approach the corner as white's answer is evident, and really advantagous for him. Either consolidate your top right, or approach from the other side as you have a wall on the lower side facing the top left.

;W[he]C[Let him capture this stone, it's almost useless. Plus you endanger the other stones. (They die later). Keep on attacking the D10 stone, or protect your top left stones.]

(;B[gd];W[ee]C[Ouch. I don't see any good variation for black. This is punishment for trying to protect one lonely stone, and for leaving your wall full of holes.]
