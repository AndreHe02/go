RE[B+Resign]

C[Hi! Thanks for reviewing. I played white in this game, which was a slow-paced game with little fighting. I felt as though my position was very thin throughout, and I was lucky that black didn't attack more strongly.

Empiror: to improve fast, always assume ur opponent can see everything u can, not otherwise:).  and for amatuers, fighting is where the fun really is, peaceful game only provide us a false sense of me-playing-like-a-pro, which isn't so healthy for improvement.]

;B[nd];W[rd]C[Emp: this move rids the possibility of 3-3 for w, not recommended for this situation and timing.]
;B[qc];W[pi];B[jc];W[jp]C[I am interested in the timing of R6 invasion. Is it a good idea at all with R12 having so much aji? If it is, when should it be played?

Emp: i like the way you thought, u showed some sophistication there. consider w has got K4 to limit b's moyo, R6 invasion has became of little value. to make it simple, u can consider b can go S8 anytime for free, that makes R6 invasion even more trivial. to me, R3,S4 looks more appealing in the future. 

K4 is a good move.]
(;B[fq]C[Emp: wrong direction for b.];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[hq]
C[Here was the first point at which I was confused. I don't know how to handle K4, and the play in the game was very bad. Maybe J3 here?

Emp: w should be pretty contented with K4 actually. 
1) H3 was an unbearablely narrow extension for b, it's the value of K4.
2) b's got no lethal attacking moves for K4 
3) K4 got access to the center and O3, no panic is necessary now.]

(;W[ho]C[Emp: interesting move, but unless w got a cool grand strategy, move like this is hard to play.]

Emp: w had been doing fine or even better than b before the death on the right side and huge mis on the left. for us amatuers, the level of our playing depends more on the severeness of our mistakes rather than the greatness of our good moves. w really needs to work on how to avoid low level mistakes. b needs to learn how to be a shark, bite as soon as seeing blood:)]
