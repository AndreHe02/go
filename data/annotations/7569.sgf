AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Eizero [14k\]: hi gg

I played as black, my opponent white.



Hello I am shadowrun and will review your game. I will mark my comments with SR: and my aim for players around 15k is to show them ideas, plans and options rather than complex tesuji which are too difficult to read for them. From my experience they simply benefit more from a general plan than from deep reading variations that they cannot reproduce on the board.]
;W[nq]C[turtle25 [10k\]: hallo];B[lq];W[qn]C[I don't think it's good to play here.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp]C[SR: Until this move it is a normal joseki. You can study the variations at, for example www.eidogo.com]
(;B[jc];W[qf]LB[po:A]C[SR: white should play A and punish black´s tenuki]
(;B[qh]LB[qn:A]C[SR: This pincer seems to be bad since you normally only pincer if you have already support at that side but here A stone is white and not black]
;W[nc]LB[qc:C][oe:A][pf:B]TR[jc][qh]C[SR: Now black has several options. A is the normal move to get out and separate the white stones. B would lead to a similar joseki like we have seen before. The move C is normally not very recommendable after the double kakari but in this situation together with the marked pincer stones it can become a very good move which leads to a fight where you can use the marked stones.]
;B[oe];W[qc]LB[pc:A][qd:B]C[SR: In situations like this you block to the side that has more potential to become big. Therefore A is better than B]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[mc]LB[gc:B][je:E][dj:A][po:C][fq:D]C[What would be a better move? M16?

SR: I think your move is possible but too early. The whole board is open and there are bigger places to play. Without any order I would suggest moves from A to E.]
;W[nd]C[SR: the natural response to not get enclosed in the corner]
;B[ne];W[md]LB[lc:C][mc:A][ne:B][qf:D]C[SR: Now you see that you have forced white to get out and become strong. A is weak now and you should defend with C. The B stone does not help you reducing the aji of D nor does the wall help you much here.]
;B[qk]LB[lc:B][po:A]C[I don't think the opponent should've have tried to save this stone.

SR: It is not about saving this stone in particular but using its bad aji in that area. White can treat R14 light and use it to reduce your pseudomoyo there. You could have played at R9 directly without the exchanges at N17. Now you already have 2 moves in debt: A and B. Very soon these 2 moves will become very big for white]
;W[pg]LB[nh:A][oi:B]C[SR: Do not touch stones when you want to attack. Touching stones leads to both groups becoming stronger and you do not want to get his weak group becoming stronger nor do you need to become even stronger. Try to enclose white with moves like A or B since white cannot make 2 eyes locally.]
;B[ph]C[I think this move was bad, I think I should've reinforced my upper group.]
;W[og]LB[md:B][oe:A][mf:D][og:C]C[SR: Now white is out and A group becomes weak. The plan is to run out with A and keep B and C separated. D would do this and keep the pressure on white.]
(;B[ng]C[SR: This move looks crude];W[nh]C[The opponent should've just played p12 imo. That would be really quite bad for me.]
;B[oh];W[nf]LB[me:A][mg:B]C[SR: In situations like this you have to read out that B works before you play it. Otherwise it is like ALL IN in poker and you might lose a lot! So playing A would be safer.  Also you have to understand that white is out after p13 and there is no brute force method if your own group at P15 is quite weak.]
;B[mg];W[me];B[of]
(;W[mf];B[qg];W[pf];B[rf]C[SR: If you have read all these moves in advance than you are strong!]
;W[rd];B[pe]C[So some of his stones die but I think it could've went the the other way if he played differently.

SR: Like I said defend first and get strong before you attack if you cannot read it out]
;W[lc]C[SR: small at the moment since the board is open everywhere]
;B[lg]LB[gc:D][jc:C][je:A][pm:B][po:E]C[SR: A reasonable move since it has follow ups at A and B. But it is no urgent move nor one of the biggest. C is getting weak and you should think about A or D as some kind of urgent moves first. Also E is still urgent before you can think about creating a big center moyo with a move around B. So A, D and E as urgent moves first and than the left side and after that your move is very big]
;W[ke]LB[fc:D][cf:C][cn:B][po:A][fq:E]C[SR: also too small. A-E are better]
;B[gc]LB[ce:A]C[SR: Very good!!! A double purpose move that helps the corner and K17. Later there is a follow up move at A to get a shimari and the corner is more or less safe.]
;W[cn];B[fq]
(;W[bq]LB[bp:A][cq:B]C[SR: looks like a missclick - A or B are possible]
;B[ck]LB[bo:A][co:B]TR[cn][bq]C[SR: His large knight´s move shape has weaknesses and can be cut. So you can use that to cut or press him down on the second line before playing your move which is fine if you think the left side is bigger than the corner. So think about A or B first to put a finger on his weaknesses.]
;W[cq]LB[po:C][dq:B][iq:A]C[SR: I would recommend A here otherwise w can attack the F3 group later and also use O3 aji. So A is urgent and B is only big but doesn´t help your group. Still you have to keep in mind that you have a debt to play C]
;B[dq]LB[hq:A]C[SR: Now there is weakness around A that you have to fix]
;W[dr]C[SR: small and helps B getting good shape];B[er];W[cr]
C[SR: too small again. Remember not to play second line moves if not necessary. Necessary means 1) getting eyeshape 2) defend or 3) attack. Otherwise it has to be considered as an endgame move which is too small in middle game.]
;B[co]C[SR: good - press him down];W[bo];B[dn];W[cm];B[dm];W[cl]
;B[dl]C[SR: I like this sequence very much. Now your center moyo is getting very huge. Well done!!]
;W[bl];B[bk]LB[ce:A][po:B]C[SR: good response - his B8 was not big nor necessary - If you get a stone at A and can fix B than white is in big trouble]
;W[cp]LB[eo:A]C[SR: aji keshi - a move that helps black to fix his weakness. Otherwise white has a peep at A which might have helped him later]
;B[do];W[jq]C[SR: Now you have to make a decision! Let white live small on the side and get a huge center or try to kill white. If the center is as huge as your center I would recommend letting white live small. Otherwise, if white runs out and manages to live, than he has destroyed a lot of your center moyo.]

(;W[hr]C[SR: this is a mistake and you punish it correctly]
;B[hp]C[SR: Well done - white is dead];W[kq]

(;B[ko];W[mn];B[mm];W[or]LB[nm:A][kn:B]TR[mm][om][nn]C[SR: Tiger´s mouth is a strong shape. So do not play at A if there is no need to play there. Simply play B]
(;B[nm];W[dj]C[SR: Do not peep if you can cut];B[ch]C[SR: good]
;W[cj]
(;B[dk];W[bj];B[ak]
(;W[al];B[ni]LB[ce:A][nh:B]C[SR: a move without any urgency. Better play A. And if he tries to activate B he will face some very strong walls]
;W[eh]LB[ce:A][ej:B][hk:C]C[SR: you have to choose between A and B now. Remember C is the big area you want to protect on the long run but A is also very very big]
;B[di]LB[cf:A]C[SR: That are only 3 stones - white can treat them lightly and use their aji to play around A or he can run out into your precious moyo and if you cannot kill him than he has destroyed a lot of points - so my advice: 

First try to block and than try to enclose and than try to kill]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[gj];B[fi];W[fj];B[jf];W[je]
(;B[ie];W[kf]
(;B[kg];W[jg];B[if];W[jh]LB[jc:C][ie:B][ij:A]C[SR: A area is urgent - B is safe and even if you lose C somehow it does not matter as long as you keep control over A area]
;B[id];W[li]LB[ij:A][jj:D][ik:B][jk:C]C[SR: Now play somewhere around this area A-D since this is the place where white can make eyespace]
;B[mh]LB[pg:A]C[SR: not needed - you can capture A at any time]
;W[mi]C[Eizero [14k\]: You really think you can survive here?]
;B[ki]C[turtle25 [10k\]: i dont know
turtle25 [10k\]: but why not trying
Eizero [14k\]: I see.

SR: Do not play contact moves since both sides will become strong
 First reduce eyespace than kill];W[kh];B[lh];W[lm]C[Eizero [14k\]: I made a mistake]
;B[kn];W[km]C[SR: Now you see that white got momentum in the center]

(;B[jl]LB[gl:A]C[SR: another vital point but remember that K7 is sente!! So first reduce eyespace around A than kill by playing the vital points - not vice versa]
;W[jm]
(;B[kk]C[I know where I should've played I didn't notice it.]
;W[jo]LB[cc:L][bh:J][fh:E][hh:D][aj:K][fj:F][dm:G][jm:B][fp:H]
[kp:A][jq:C][fs:I]C[SR: ok now the situation has changed - try to get an overview over the new situation:
A is dead now so that B and C are alive
D cannot escape so that E is alive
only F and G are unclear but G looks alive in gote at least. So a move at H and I would make 2 eyes. You can also play J first so that white answers K. Apart from that you can try to kill F. After G group is safe you should play L which is the biggest move]

SR: before resigning try to estimate the score!! You are still leading by over 30 points if you play A and B group does not die somehow.
So in general I liked your moves and your decisions very much. Even though you made a big mistake you were still leading. Just 2 things to mention. 

1) Try to make strong groups before you attack (C12-D11) and nobi once more before you hane again so that there are not so many cutting points (moves 74,94,116 and 118)

2) Try to remember that it is often better to let a group live small than to chase it inside your moyo because if you cannot kill it than you have lost your moyo as well. And when you want to kill do not play contact moves since both groups will become stronger. First enclose than reduce eyespace and than play the vital points to kill. 

Apart from that you played very well !!];B[cc])
(;B[fp];W[tt];B[hq]LB[js:A]C[SR: taking the 2 stones is not only life but also strong sente because you threaten to play A]

(;B[jo]C[SR: connect of course]))
