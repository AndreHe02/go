C[f: hello];B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[ic]C[f: better played supporting your stone on the right, L16 is seen quite a lot, or N17/O17 for a fairly secure large corner.  this leaves a big gap inviting the enemy to invade.]
;W[jp]
(;B[cf]C[f: this extension could afford to be much further - if a C17 (3x3) invasion is mounted then you can push the stones towards J17 and build a strong wall facing downwards - in that case you'd much rather have this stone around C10 (see variation on previous move)]
;W[oc]C[f: ah, the invitation is accepted];B[qf]C[f: this is quite low, I'd prefer Q14 so as to add a bit more pressure from above (so to speak) to the white stone above.]
;W[kc];B[cn]C[f: a couple of proverbs which are always worth bearing in mind:

- connect your weak groups

- attack your opponents weak groups to strengthen your position

here you are potentially creating a new weak group, and allowing white to attack you with a move such as E6 which would give him a huge moyo (roughly sketched out territory)]
;W[pj];B[mc]C[where should i play to cut both white stones?. The result from there isn't that good for black.

f: very aggressive approach... another proverb:

- secure a base before attacking / attack from a strong position

your stone on the left here is weak, a weakness which will likely come back to haunt you]
;W[mb]C[f:  take this as white saying "which side do you want?" and hane (see variations)]

(;B[kb];W[lb]
(;B[lc]C[f: avoid these kind of moves (which don't increase your liberties or significantly reduce the opponents) unless you have a strong (L18) stone to support your cut.  you can read this going wrong better next time]
;W[jb];B[jc];W[kd];B[me]C[f: see how the weak stones weigh you down]
;W[dl];B[fq]C[f: nice, mix it up];W[cq];B[eo]C[f: "make a decision"]
;W[do]C[f: "ok I'll take the left"];B[dn]C[f: "not the left!  i don't want to lose the left!"]
;W[en]C[f: "ok then, you decide what you want"];B[iq]C[f: "well I definitely want the right"]
;W[fo]C[f: "don't mind if I eat this one then?"];B[ep]C[f: "no I want that one too!"]
;W[em]C[f: "well, you can't have everything... I'll just take what I wanted in the first place"]
;B[bk]C[f: "over my dead body!"];W[bl]C[f: ok, so what's happened here is that your attack went a bit wrong at the start and you're refusing to let go of any stones.  clinging to non-important stones only helps your opponent take more points from you - it's like showing your opponent your weakness so they can keep pushing at it.  each time he changes to attack the other side and you have to defend, your power is weakened.  by choosing to defend both sides passively (i.e. by responding rather than attacking), you make things very difficult for yourself.

on the upside, your group at the bottom is fairly strong with a base now, and if you fall back to C10 on the left then you're defending whilst threatening to connect your C6 stones (which you should not allow yourself to get too attached to at this point - let their existence worry & annoy your enemy rather than be a burden on yourself. i forget what the japanese term is for this but it's a widely understood & practiced technique)]
;B[cl]C[f: with a stone at C10 this would be a good move... without, it's suicide]

(;W[cm]C[f: W offers you a nice connection & extension of your C14 stones]

(;B[bm];W[ck];B[dm]C[f: w should've connected as you would have struggled for life]

(;W[bj];B[cl];W[ak];B[bp];W[bn]C[f: this is a bit crazy];B[bo]
;W[cm];B[an];W[co];B[cl];W[bq];B[dq];W[cp];B[cm]
(;W[dr];B[eq];W[ho]C[f: w concerning himself with some unimportant stones]

(;W[aq];B[bs];W[ao];B[ar]C[Pavel [14k\]: lol
Pavel [14k\]: :)
Jef0 [15k\]: shortage :D
Pavel [14k\]: I'm officially blind
Jef0 [15k\]: hehe

f: haha, a lucky break for you!];W[og]C[f: ok, don't just respond without re-assessing the board (i see you didn't just respond - good job).

- where are your weak groups
- where are your opponent's weak groups
- can you strengthen any of your weak groups whilst attacking your opponent's?

- can you join any of your weak groups together?
- can you split your opponent into weak groups?


attack: well, he doesn't have any obvious weak groups, but you can split him with F8 to create a couple - would create one of your own though, so maybe split like the variation.  doesn't really do anything for your defense.  if there was a clear attacking move which also helped defend, it would be a great choice right now.

defend: got to look into connecting those two groups in the top right, though be prepared to sacrifice the two M17 stones in order to stop W spreading.

another proverb:

- play urgent moves before big moves

your choice for the next move was big, so good in that respect, but defending around P15 is urgent.]

(;B[nq];W[np];B[kq];W[kp];B[lq];W[lp];B[pb];W[nc];B[nd];W[ob]
C[f: eugh, w makes an empty triangle and comes to a decision about which way to connect too fast.  a move at P16 would've left the options open and put much more pressure on you.  you punish him well for this mistake.]
;B[pc];W[od];B[oe]
(;W[pd]C[f: a move like you did before - playing into the opponent's stones, not gaining any liberties...]
;B[pe];W[pa];B[qa];W[oa];B[qc];W[ib];B[hc]
(;W[ld];B[md];W[kf];B[dk]C[f: neat];W[el];B[cj];W[ci];B[bk]
;W[rb];B[qb];W[ck];B[ke]C[that ko threat was a mess. I dunno how to calculate the points, but cutting those stones, and connecting to the upper corner seemed vital for me.
Could i have won the ko? I see o19, then n19, and maybe r11 and r3, are there more threats?

f: can't see any more than what you suggest - would be good to get some stones down on the right that's for sure, and he would likely respond.  the stone you've played here only weakens your position, as W can always take at L19 to escape.  At least connecting your cutting stones at D10 keeps the pressure on the left side.]
;W[dj];B[le];W[jd];B[je];W[id]C[f: weakens your H17 stones...but on the plus side, you're building a wall (albeit a bit dampened by w's stones) which is facing the w wall below.  another proverb or two:

- use thickness to attack
- do not approach thickness

so, you should be thinking about attacking the loose stones near the middle, without coming too close to w's wall below.]
;B[qi];W[fc];B[gd]
(;W[hd]C[f: think W is trying to do too much here and should play H18 - you've made the decision about which way you're going and he can gain even if he doesn't immediately fight against your decision.]
;B[gc];W[cc];B[dc];W[cb];B[db];W[be];B[cd];W[bd];B[ab]C[f: I'm rusty on life + death situations but this looks like a superb move]

(;B[qh];W[ph];B[mg]C[f: white's main aim at the moment should be to create a wall facing downwards, thus making use of his lower wall which is facing upwards.  yours should be to neutralise his wall by creating a strong position facing it above.]
;W[mh]
(;B[lg];W[lh];B[kg];W[kh]C[should had i continued pushing? It was sente and i dont lose nothing, but white moyo is way bigger than mine...

f: nope don't push here, you're helping him make the best possible use of his lower wall.  be more agressive about breaking through at the start, and realise the L14 stone means nothing.]

C[had i played the ko threat o19 in time, now the upper white group should be dead i think, by killing an eye at j19, is it right?

f: yep nice spot - it could still work if W makes a small mistake... you have to approach in the most subtle way possible, by taking away F17's liberties, which makes J19 atari, threatening either taking the F17 stones, or killing the whole group...]

(;B[df];W[di];B[ec];W[qg];B[fa]C[f: d'oh, almost.  W made the mistake!  it's always good to check out what you can gain from a throw-in sacrifice when in situations like this, I don't think a throw-in that demands a reply actually loses you any points either, as it takes away one of their territory points.]

f: a little more awareness of the weak groups on the board and the strong areas (e.g. where walls are facing), and a little less attachment to individual stones (both ones on the boards and ones you could throw-in to reduce eye space) would see you winning games like these every time! 

Hope you found the review interesting, good luck & catch you on KGS sometime.

Cheers,
