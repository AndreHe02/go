C[Well, in this game, black played strane fuseki, but white didn't get advantage anywhere.

1. Try to attack groups, which are weak, overconcentrate groups, which are strong (variation at move 7).

2. Move, which makes few points more but it's weaker than strong and calm move, is not a good move in beginning or middle game. Main factor in these stages is strength of your groups. Strong groups helps you to keep sente, to control flow of the game. Weak groups/shapes needs additionals moves, which means lost of sente and beeing controled by oponnent. Ex. move 32

3. And last but the most important for every player - Reading! Before you play any move, decide what you want to gain with that move. Then try to read few variations. Don't try to read them all, but read, read, read. Practice makes master. Critical moves you should read as far as possible. And moves with little variations you are able to read lot of moves ahead (likes ladders or net).]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[jq]C[This is queit strange as white can extend from D16 along right side to get influence and also reduce black's shallow moyo.]

(;W[dl]C[Because of F4, I would try to overconcentrate black... F4 looks like a mistake, as black has only lower side, while white has influence over two sides. See var]
