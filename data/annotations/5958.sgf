C[DashTwelve: Hello];B[dd];W[pp];B[qd];W[do]C[DashTwelve: Good luck =)

I'm still unfamiliar with a lot of early game moves, but I'm trying to see what works (I know corners are easiest to defend and  I try to develop them first).

You're right ; this 5-4 point is a bit unsual (most usual moves are the 4-4 and 3-4 points), but entirely ok.]
;B[ep]C[This is a bad move];W[dp]C[good answer, now his e4 stone is looking very bad ; such a kind of  "shoulder" move is in most cases a bad approach. He should have played at d3 or e3 instead, for instance.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[fq];W[dr]C[This sequence probably isn't joseki, any advice on possible variations?

On your side, no problem, you have a slight edge now.];B[er]
C[this makes a ko ; it is not of primary importance, but if you manage the capture, his 3 stones would be in trouble, while your corner is already solid.]
;W[eo]C[capturing instead would feel logical, but this is ok.]
;B[iq];W[fp]LB[cf:A][ci:B]SQ[do][eo]C[once again, why not capture the ko ? or play  elsewhere, for instance with your wall ("square" stones), it would be very good to get an extension, for instance at B. You can also make a classical approach of the corner at A, and then develop this western side.]
;B[eq];W[cr]LB[fp:A]TR[ep][dq][eq][fq][iq][er]C[your move at A ended in gote, which is bad for you. So you should not have made this atari, and you wouldn't have feared that he plays at c2, for you would just capture the ko then. Even now, not defending your d2 stone would be better (it's just a ston and a few points in the corner, while his marked group is already so concentrated that he wouldn't gain strength by adding more stones to it. So you should go and play elsewhere.]
;B[gp];W[fo]C[ok, you could also envision to let him capture this stone, his group is so strong anyway ...]
;B[hp]C[this is a bad move, his group is already too strong (overconcentrated), he should play elsewhere on the board.]
;W[pf]LB[oc:A][od:B]C[I wasn't sure how to react here, so I decided to kakari the top right.  Perhaps a move along the lines of D10 would have been better?  Or perhaps around L5?

the right side feels very important as you have a wall towards it, indeed. L5 wouldn't be an interesting point, though, for it would just attack a group which is alraedy more than living.
And as a kakari here, A and B are more usual. Here you allow black to take one of these points right now, getting a shimari (which is very strong).]
;B[od];W[oe]LB[pi:A]C[Again, unsure of joseki, but I did my best.

black has the corner, while you have something on the eastern side, so playing around A to establish a bas here would be more logical. As you push on the 5th line, black makes territory at the top on the 4th line (which is too big usually for the strength you get in exhange)]
;B[qe]LB[nd:A]C[playing at A instead would be best for black.]
;W[qf]LB[oc:B][nd:A]C[this is a fair point, but A is much bigger (destroys his top territory prospects, and threatens to plays B if he doesn't defend there]
;B[nd]C[here black is happy with a big territory];W[ne];B[pe]
;W[og];B[ld];W[le];B[me];W[mf];B[md];W[lf];B[nf];W[of];B[ng]
;W[nh];B[ke]C[This is where I start to lose the top

It started when you approached  from q14 actually. But nothing is lost ; you've suffered a loss at the top, but gained something in the lower left in the opening.]
;W[kf]
(;B[jj]LB[jf:A]C[Tengen ladder breaker, maybe M12 as opposed to capturing immediately?

This move doesn't seem right to me ; making the hane at A would make use of these two "captured" stones, as it would threaten to free them.]
;W[mg];B[jf]C[now black has lost a whole move.];W[je]C[Not sure how to react on this; he's pushing me lower towards line 12, and I need to take the top.

The top will be at least partly balck territory, so you just might want to make sure it won't be too big. This atari is good, but don't forget to build your own territory (on the left side for instance).]
;B[kd]LB[if:A][jg:B]C[Here, you want to atari from A, not from B. B helps your group, which is alraedy so strong it doesn't need it at all. A on the other hand might help you surviving on top side.]
;W[jg];B[if];W[ig];B[gf]LB[hf:A]C[oops, black needs to play A to protect his huge top side. Now you can atari there, see variation.]

(;W[dj]LB[hf:A][pn:B][np:C]C[Wrong time for D10?  Where should I have played otherwise?

At A for sure. When this is settled, you have two big areas : this right side, due to your bottom side wall, and the right side, due to your top wall.
B or C for instance are moves you moght want to make in the future.]
;B[gi]C[My connection from the bottom left to the top right is getting ruined, and he's penetrating into the middle, which is bad for me.

There is no possible connection between two so widely separated areas. This point he is playing is just of no interest : your two groups are already alive on their own, and noone is going to make territory on the center in this game, because black can invade the center from his bottom group, and you can invade it from your two big groups. So action concentrates on side (top first, as you can enter it in sente right now, and then left and right are both pretty big).]
;W[gh]TR[gp][hp][ip][iq]C[I try to cut him off...

You don't need to do so, nothing to be gained from it. 
He can enter the center from his solid bottom group, so you won't make much of a territory in the center.]
;B[fh];W[hg];B[gg];W[hh];B[hf]C[now his top territory is very big, he has taken back the lead I think.]
;W[fi];B[eh];W[ei];B[gj]C[Which fails.

Well, you did cut him, but don't gain much by doing so];W[gl]
LB[qn:A]SQ[lj][jl][ll]C[ok, this is sensible, now that he's cut from top you have to cut him from the bottom. But the best you can hope is to enclose him with somehting like the 4 stones intaersection, making a tiny territory only. Actually, the right side is still bigger (consider a black move at A for instance ; black would live fairly easily, and your big wall wouldn't be of much use then]
;B[hl];W[hj]LB[ch:B][qn:A]C[here you try to capture two stones, but this is very small ! he should leave them to you, and to get big areas (like survive on the right (A for isntance), extend his bottom towards the center to reduce your territory there, or take a piece of the left side (B for instance).]
;B[hi];W[ii];B[ij];W[hk];B[ik];W[gk];B[ji];W[ih]
(;B[gm]C[He's got a solid hold on most of the top of the board, which is bad here.]
;W[il];B[hm]LB[jl:A][im:B]TR[ml][pl][pn]SQ[gm]C[He jsut made two mistakes here, playing the marked stones. The area where he wants to prevent your from making territory is the triangle-area, and he's not doing so right now.

Here the shape move to extend your lone stone, and try to take hold of the center is A, not B. Note that after A, your two stones have 4 liberties, while only 3 after B. This is very important when being surrounded by some enemy stones.]

(;W[im];B[hn];W[jo];B[jn];W[in];B[io];W[kn];B[jm];W[jl]
(;B[cc]LB[km:B][qn:A]C[The 3-3 invasion would have been huge here, I think, especially as I ended up losing the game based off the top territory.  Could I have won if I managed to pull the invasion off?

The right side seems to be still bigger, I'd try to invade it first ; moreover, B is very huge here, as it would make his stones live I think, destroying much of your right side prospects]
;W[km]LB[pl:A]C[This si very big, nicely done. Now you have to turn the A area into territory to retani chances.]
;B[fl];W[fj];B[em]LB[qo:B][kq:A]C[He threatens to invade your left side territory, but this is much smaller than the right side, so you should ignore him and build the biggest (A claims for the biggest area possible, knwoing that black could still live somewhere (sans san invasion for instance) while B protects both the corner and the side ; both are interesting. A move on the left is much smaller]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[cl];B[dn];W[cm];B[en];W[cn];B[dk];W[ck];B[ci]
C[Finally, he encloses some extra territory on the left side, but you still have bigger movres on the bottom right]
;W[cj]C[You connect two group which are both completely alive ! This is a lost move unfortunately.]
;B[dh];W[bi];B[qq]C[finally, black goes to the big area first ; the game is over. Had you played there first, I think the game would have been close]
;W[pq]C[His 3-3 invasion, which I probably should have protected against.

Indeed. It's har to quatify in terms of points the moves at this stage, but your C10 moves was worth maybe 5-10, B11 10-12, while any move in this bottom right area was worth 35-40 i'd say...]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[pr];W[or];B[rr];W[ps]C[Again, not sure on joseki here.

Joseki is not important, where you want to make territory is much more. At this stage, you want to enclose definitely the center + rght side area, so s5 feels bigger]
;B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[rm];B[qr];W[qm];B[sn]C[unnecessary];W[qj]
LB[bg:C][cg:B][kq:A]C[Trying to connect the bottom right and top.

Unnecessary too I think, there is no way black can live in this area, as you are so strong all around, so no need for an additionnal move. At this stage, 2 big points remain : A to close your bottom side (the biggest one), and B or C to enter his left side territory]
;B[mo];W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[nk];W[nl];B[ml];W[mm];B[ol];W[nm]
;B[mk];W[ok]LB[li:A]C[Black manages to live in the middle of my territory, which cost me a lot of points.

Here he's dead, but with some training you'll be able to kill such an attempt very soon. remember, you don't need to capture every stone to kill, you just have to prevent him from making 2 eyes. So playing at the contact of his stoens is not necessary, just play small moves preventing any eye attempt (for instance, if you play at A here there will be no eyes anymore for sure)]
;B[oj];W[pk];B[ni];W[oi];B[pi];W[oh];B[pj];W[qi];B[li]LB[kk:A]
SQ[kj][lj][mj][lk]C[Here, where does he thraeten to make eyes ? Just one the square intersections, right ? So how about paying such a tiny move as A ? It will be enough to prevent him from making two eyes ! no need to try to disconnect as you will do here]
;W[ki];B[kh];W[kj];B[kk]LB[mi:A]C[Playinh at A still allows him to make only one eye]
;W[ph];B[nj]LB[mi:A]C[Same story again, A kills];W[kg];B[lj]
C[Now he is alive];W[lh];B[mi];W[jh];B[ki];W[ll];B[lk]C[I tried to kill the middle group, but there's two eyes.]
;W[pl];B[id]LB[cg:A][bh:B]C[Was Black's J16 necessary?  Could I have done anything there?

I'd say no, but yuo can try as you'll be losing otherwise ; on the other hand a move like A for you, and B for him is still very big]
;W[sm]C[I'm trying to see if I can force a mistake here.];B[sp]
;W[jq];B[jr];W[kq];B[kr];W[lr];B[jp];W[kp];B[ir];W[ip];B[ho]
C[I had my eyes set on potentailly the black stones around G7, but they ended up living.  I doubt I could have killed them anyway.]
;W[ek];B[el];W[fk];B[gr];W[ks];B[js];W[ls];B[mr];W[mq];B[bh]
C[D12 probably would have gained more points for me if I had played it, as I would have managed to steal some of the top territory.]
;W[cg];B[ch];W[bg];B[fg]C[Failed attempt to get some surviving stones up top.]
;W[ah];B[bj];W[bk];B[ai];W[ag];B[be];W[ce];B[bd];W[bf];B[cd]
;W[de];B[ee];W[ak];B[rf]C[Again, I should have grabbed some territory along the edges by R14 as well.]
;W[rg];B[re];W[sf];B[se];W[sg];B[mh];W[fn]C[Again, trying to work the bottom group.]
;B[fm];W[es];B[fs];W[ds];B[gq];W[aj]C[Maybe I can connect...]
;B[bi]C[Nope.];W[ef];B[fe];W[qs];B[rs];W[os];B[kl];W[lm];B[tt]
;W[tt]C[And that's the game.  Thank you for your help reviewing!

One more thing; did Black think the Ko on K4 was just a waste, then, and that's why it wasn't played?

Black doesn't need to play it to win, so he can let you connect there and win anyway.

Well, interesting game, I hope you'll learn and enjoy from your coming games (maybe you'll have already improved a lot your play when you read this commentary compared to when you played the game, one month ago if I have it right). Anyway, have fun ! (and don't hesitate to contact me for any other question or reviews)
