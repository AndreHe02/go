C[  Reviewed by Ed Cherlin for GTL. Requested by Zell Hyde (Black).



The first question in go is always, "What is the biggest move?" When  you know your opponent's biggest possible move, you can decide  whether to make a bigger move (if you have one) or to prevent or  reduce your opponent's gain.



Never get bogged down in local fighting and lose sight of the whole  board situation. When only small moves remain for both sides in a  fight, make a larger move somewhere else.]
;B[pd]C[This move is  estimated to be worth 10 points. Make these big moves until there are  none left.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq]C[This attack is also a big  move.]
;W[hp]C[So is White's counterattack.];B[cq]LB[fo:a]C[Not joseki. Play at a.



Invading the 3-3 point now gains very little territory (a small move  for you) while giving the opponent outside influence (a large move  for the enemy). This isn't the right time to do  it.]
;W[dq];B[cp]C[When your opponent plays in contact with your  stones, fighting begins. Reinforcing your first stone is a big  move.]
;W[dr]LB[co:a]C[Timid. White should hane around the end of the  two Black stones at a, confining Black to the corner.]
;B[do]C[Now  Black gets the hane, a big move that gains influence on the left  side.]
;W[fp]C[White's formation is strong but  small.];B[dn]LB[cl:a]
C[Too timid (a very small move). Extend further,  mark out territory elsewhere, or challenge White in the upper left. A  move at a would give Black and White territories of similar size.]
;W[ck]C[Blocking Black's expansion on this side is very  big.]
;B[dm]LB[cl:a][di:b]C[Too heavy (another kind of small move). It  leaves the black group open to invasion. Attack at a (blocking White  out of the Black territory) or at b, or mark territory  elsewhere.]
;W[bm]C[The invasion.];B[bn];W[cn];B[cm]LB[bo:a]C[This  move looks forceful, but it allows White to invade further. Pull back  to a to secure this side.]
;W[bo];B[co];W[an];B[pj]C[The black group in the corner is weak, while the white  groups on either side are sound. You might end up with 4 points in  the corner, while White has marked out 15 points or more on the  sides.]
;W[np];B[qn];W[bl];B[fn];W[go];B[ek];W[dj]C[Black's push into  the center gains no territory, but forces White to wall off territory  on both sides.]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[gk];W[bp];B[bq];W[ao];B[jc]C[Much  better.];W[hc]
;B[nq]LB[kp:a][nn:b]TR[jc][pd][pj][qn][fn][gk][pp]MA[ep][ds]
[cr][cs][aq][fi][gi][hh][hg][hf][ie][id][ic][ib][ia][hn][in]
[jn][kn][ln][mn][mo][oq][or][os]C[This  weak move gains little, and leaves the upper right open for a White  invasion. The place for a Black invasion would be at a.



However, Black would do better to concentrate on the potential moyo  bounded by the marked stones, with a play at b. The area of Black  influence is much larger than the area than White's, although White  has stronger walls around two territories. Black will not get the  whole huge moyo in the middle and the right, but can end up with a  substantial part of it.]
;W[oq];B[op];W[mq]C[The Black stone in atari should be  abandoned.]
;B[nr]LB[pq:a]C[There is no reason to defend this stone.  Block White out of the corner at a.]
;W[or];B[mr];W[lq]C[White now  threatens to capture the three black  stones.]
;B[mp]LB[pq:a][no:b]C[Black should either save the three  Black stones by attacking the group of two White stones on their  right at a, or forget this small battle and concentrate on keeping  White out of the middle with a move at b.]
;W[no]C[White is now forced to invade the moyo.];B[lp]C[This stone  is too deep in White's area of influence.]
;W[lr];B[kp]LB[lm:a]C[The  only way to save these Black stones from being surrounded is to jump  out into the middle. A move at a would have been  reasonable.]
;W[gm];B[fo];W[ep];B[gn];W[hn]C[White is forced to  strengthen the wall. Black should be building walls around the moyo  instead.]
;B[ho]C[No.];W[io];B[pf]LB[md:a][id:b][gh:c][nm:d]C[Timid. The place to prevent  an invasion is at a.



Playing at b, c, or d to confine one of White's groups would be  better, since White would have to defend rather than attacking on the  next move.]
;W[lc]C[The invasion.];B[je]LB[kd:a]C[The Black wall on  the right radiates influence. Drive the White stone toward the Black  strength, by playing at a. Then White will gain a small territory  while Black walls off a bigger area in the upper right corner and  gains influence in the upper middle.]
;W[gl]C[A small move,  threatening nothing.];B[fl]LB[nc:a][nm:b]
C[A small reply. The points  a and b are both large.];W[ob]
C[Now White has a base. Walling this group in is  vital.];B[nc]
;W[nb];B[mc];W[mb]C[Good for  Black.];B[ld];W[kc];B[kd];W[jb]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[ib];W[ka];B[ic]C[White has gained 4 points of territory so far, while  Black has gained a solid wall on one side of the central  moyo.]
;W[hd]C[A tiny move.];B[hk]C[Also too small.];W[jl]C[A very big  move for White. It invades the moyo, and also threatens the three  stones in a line near the bottom.]
;B[hh]LB[jk:a]C[Black is defending  on the side where White is not attacking. A move at a is much better.]
;W[ji]C[A serious invasion.];B[jg]LB[li:a][jk:b]C[Keeping the Black  groups connected with this move is not as important as defending the  moyo. The Black group on the left has excellent eye shape and will be  fine on its own.



A defensive move at a is good, and an attack at b is still possible.]
;W[nj]C[Half of Black's original moyo has vanished.];B[lm]C[Too late  to rescue the three Black stones.]
;W[nm];B[pl]C[This side is safe.  What remains of the moyo is still in  danger.]
;W[ph];B[oi];W[qk];B[ni]LB[qi:a]C[Defending against the  invasion on the side is now bigger. One possibility is at  a.]
;W[qj]C[Now White has a base on the right side.];B[pk];W[pi]
;B[qg];W[qh];B[mj];W[mk];B[nk];W[nl];B[oj];W[ml];B[lk];W[ll]
;B[kl]LB[kk:a][jk:b]C[The  four Black stones cannot be saved. A move at a must be answered at  the marked point, and then Black can cut off one White stone and make  a solid wall at b.]
;W[kk];B[km]C[The wrong  side.];W[lj];B[il];W[jm];B[jk];W[jn]
;B[kj];W[lk];B[hm]LB[ki:a]MA[ji]C[Cutting  off the one marked stone with a play at a would have been much bigger  than capturing these two stones.]

;W[gb];B[fd];W[gc];B[ea];W[fe];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[fg]
LB[eh:a]C[Better at  a.];W[eg];B[fi];W[eh];B[fh];W[ql];B[qm]
;W[li];B[kh];W[lh];B[qb];W[oc];B[nd];W[nf]C[The last of the  moyo is gone.]
;B[od];W[pg];B[rg];W[rh];B[rl];W[rk];B[sl];W[sk];B[sm]LB[rm:a]
[rn:b]C[Adequate, but not the best.  A play at a or b is usual.]
;W[of]LB[ri:a]C[This connects the White  groups at the left and bottom. Without such a connection, the White  stones at the left could be killed by a Black move at a.



Black needs to defend the three stones above the White group.



With this move, White is ahead.];B[pq]C[A forcing (sente)  move.]
;W[ns];B[pr]C[Another forcing move.];W[ms];B[om]C[Not a forcing move. Now White takes  sente.]
;W[on]C[Small.];B[pn];W[qf]C[Big.];B[qe];W[rf];B[re];W[sg];B[iq]
C[There  is no room for eyes, so no way to save the Black stones here.]

;W[nn];B[kn];W[ko];B[pb];W[ga];B[fa]LB[eb:a]C[A bad move. Playing at a makes the group  solid. Apart from this group, only ordinary endgame moves remain. The  biggest one for either Black or White is in the lower left  corner.]

;W[os];B[rr];W[tt];B[cn]C[White wins by 43.5. The game info says 33.5. I assume  that the four White stones in the seki at the upper left were counted  as prisoners, giving Black 6 more points of territory and 4 more  prisoners than the correct score.]
