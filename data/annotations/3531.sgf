C[<W> I had played a good streak winning alot against 3kyu's, when this game 
was played, and right from the opening I was all lost. What I am mainly lookin
g for is strategical advice; many of the tactical blunders I can spot on my ow
n and learn from, but the big patterns totally elude me. I have mainly marked 
all the mistakes I noticed on my own or should have noticed in the actual game
. It's hard to comment on my thoughts as I didn't really know what I was doing
 for most of the game.];B[jj]C[<W> How does tengen games usually develop? What special openings and patter
ns should I consider when my opponents start like this??

Several openings begin with Tengen... 
Black is playing for influence of course...];W[pp];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[dd]C[This one, for example, was played by professionals players: Go Seigen, 5d - K
ubomatsu Katsukiyo, 6d, in 1934 :)]
(;W[jp]C[but here Go Seigen played at K15...];B[pn]C[As you can see from now white is flat and black got a lot of influence]
;W[qp];B[nn];W[np];B[pj];W[nc];B[jd];W[pb];B[qc]C[lack of coherence for black ; sealing white in the corner is better]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[kb];B[jb];W[kc];B[jc]C[<W> Here I am very satisfied.

yes];W[qe]C[I think it's too soon for an attack ; white is not strong enough and a big point is remaining (around D10)]
;B[pe];W[qi];B[qj];W[ph];B[oh];W[pg];B[og];W[qf];B[ri];W[rh]
;B[pi];W[qh];B[rj];W[qd];B[pc];W[of];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[rg]
;B[ob]C[<W> Missed this, my goal was to kill black...

so the result is not good for white: very small territories and black become very strong everywhere.]
;W[nb];B[qb];W[ng];B[nh];W[mg];B[ld];W[kd];B[ke];W[le];B[md]
;W[lb];B[nd];W[oc];B[pa];W[od];B[dj];W[mh]C[too slow ; white may consider an invasion at san-san now.]
;B[df];W[om];B[cn]C[black can tenuki here];W[mm]C[I don't understand the white move here: why not P6 ? 
Do you want to kill black ?];B[nj]C[<W> Obvious shape move I missed.]
;W[mj];B[nk];W[mk];B[nm];W[nl];B[ol];W[ml];B[pm]C[<W> How did P7 become so useless?

If white's aim was to make a wall to invade black moyo the only power of P7 is to keep sente (but white don't use it)]

(;W[jn];B[kp];W[jq]C[useless black is alive];B[kq];W[ko];B[jr]
C[<W> How should I have handled this better?
I did notice the rather nice influence towards the center, and figured I could
 attack heavilly on the top and left. I probably start in the wrong area...

see variation from move 80];W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[br];W[je]C[<W>... namely here. Should I do something like C17 first?

yes ; here you can consider D17];B[ep];W[eo];B[fo]
(;W[rl];B[qm];W[fp];B[kf]C[<W> This was what I wanted all along. Black can easilly get into trouble 
trying to save every stone.];W[eq];B[dc]C[<W> Too late for the corner...

Yes, and the game is over];W[jf];B[lg]

a problem book focusing on such problems...];B[kg];W[jg];B[li]

(;B[hb];W[gb]C[<W> Am I too greedy here? Should I just play J10 H9 or something?

no ; black is unreasonable here
H10 is enough];B[gc]
(;W[ib]LB[ib:A][gd:B]C[<W> Our errors balance.];B[hd];W[gd]

(;B[ge]LB[ic:C][id:B][ge:A];W[id];B[hj];W[gj]C[<W> I did not really see any way out here, the next 30 or so moves 
is pure desperation, trying hard to look for a way to kill, and in the process
 digging myself deeper.

Was I in so much trouble that this desperation was warranted?]

 some insight into how I play, and that you are able to spot the flaws I canno

To resume : don't let your opponent to build a big moyo from the early stage of the game
and keep in mind fondamentals :
- attack when you are strong
- make a san-san invasion at good timing]))
