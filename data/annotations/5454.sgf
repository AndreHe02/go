C[Hi :). First I want to thank u in advance, for spending your time for this game. I played as white in this game. Actually in this game, I was planning to play very safely, since I usually just fight and see the result. I was really hoping I'd get a good result from such play. But actually, I think I played a rather poor game, and won only because my opponent make a mistake.
So, would u please point my mistakes out? I really can't find where is the fatal mistake (I've pointed out some mistakes though).
And at last, I hope u enjoy the game :)];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[od]

(;W[lc]C[I played this move because I don't want black to get N16.
But later i think probably I should played H16 first to test black's response. Is it better?

klin: M17 too early.   Although B N16 is sente, it also helps W. When to play H16 is also an issue of timing.]
;B[lb];W[kb]C[klin: L18 not good, give B eyes.  Should either N16 or N18.]
;B[jb];W[mb];B[ka];W[md]C[klin: This result W cannot satisfy.  Therefore, W M17 too early.]

;B[ee];W[if];B[ib];W[jf]C[Later after the game I tried to play H18 and it seems black died. In the game I think trying to read it would have taken a lot of my time. That's why I retreat ><

klin: If W H18, B can only cut at G14.  After K14, K16 exchange, W can cut at E17, B outside had too many problems.]

;B[nl];W[hp]C[I'm not really sure how to play here, since I don't usually invade very often. So, some suggestions here will be very helpful :)

klin: H5 is a safe invation point.  Another possibility is D3.  It is also a chance to play at O2 now.  Later B Q1 is big, looking at S6 cut.]
;B[gq];W[hq]C[Is G4 better? I still can't decide till now.

klin: B G3 not good W H3 OK.];B[gp];W[ho];B[jp];W[go];B[dk]

klin: W left side is very thin.  So D12, even D10 is better.  It was all K2's fault.]

C[Here, I won by time (and it's dead, nevertheless). But had G11 been on H11, I'd have lost. So I felt really lucky to have won, since I think I played rather bad in this game. But the worst part is, I can't tell where is my mistake that made me behind in almost the whole game ><. So please point it out, if u don't mind :)
Thank you very much :)])
