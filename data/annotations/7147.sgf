Hello, Steve, my name is Ivan and nickname is Ral. So Ill mark my comments with R.
Now lets try to review this intresting game )];W[pp];B[dd];W[fc]
;B[cf];W[db]
(;B[qn];W[pk];B[nq]C[R. Usually, when you playing with handicap, try to not over complicate game, since you are playing with someone who is stronger than you.]
;W[pn];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo]
(;B[pr];W[ro]C[R. Its true that you havent follow a joseki and it incurred a big loss.
White seperates lone black stone and gets both territory, thickness and last but not least - sente.]
;B[oq];W[cn];B[fp]C[R. Active move, since black can peep around P4, it is posible to make some moyo.]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[ck]
(;B[ci]C[R. Very aggressive, but gives white a chance to invade. See some var.]
;W[jq]C[R. Inevitable invasion.];B[oo];W[po]
(;B[iq]C[I know black shouldn't play contact, but I wasn't sure how to attack this stone. Unsure how to deal with invasions.

R: Its true that attaching weak stones - is a bad idea, lets look at some vars.]
;W[ir]
(;B[kr]C[R. Weird move, now you let white to make very forcing moves.]
;W[hq];B[ip]
(;W[jr]C[R. white could ve pushed you very hard and this move is a rather heavy play.]
;B[hp]C[R. Connection is a top priority in this situation.]
;W[gq];B[fr]C[R. right now, there is a nasty ladder for W.]

(;W[jp];B[gr]C[R. Good forcing move, but probably it will be a good idea to save it for laters. White can ignore it.]
;W[hr];B[dn];W[co];B[dm];W[cm];B[gp]LB[eo:a][eq:b][do:c]C[Black has strong outside influence, and the white group, while easy to get life, isn't stable yet. I thought this was not bad for black.

R: Black still have some bad aji at a and b, and little cutting point at c (could be a good sacrifice tho).
White is not that hard to make a life, but black at lower right is not completely alive as well.]
;W[bq]C[Big, but doesn't seem urgent to me? The white group in the middle seems more  urgent.

R: Yes, it could be called a losing move, not urgent at all, white is in trouble]

(;B[jn]C[R. Idea is right, but direction is wrong, push opponent to your thickness, not away from that, more than thism you push him at your weakness.]
;W[lp]C[R. I would ve sealed white inside with N6. also it will be a sente]
;B[lq];W[kn];B[jm];W[jo]
(;B[km]C[R. Makes white an eye, maybe skip this one?];W[ln]
;B[nn];W[lm];B[nl]C[R. Good];W[ll]
(;B[qi]C[R. Very aggressive!];W[op];B[np];W[on];B[no];W[nm]

(;B[mm];W[om];B[ml];W[mn];B[mp]C[R. i dont understand this move. reinvorcing at N2 would be better.]
;W[mr]C[Vital spot]
(;B[lo]C[R. bad exchange, makes white stronger];W[kp];B[mo]
C[bad move, removes your liberty point];W[lr];B[ko];W[lk];B[nj]
C[R. Black is in a big big trouble with all his groups being weak]

R: True, misstake. Happens.]
(;W[io]C[White strikes at black's weak spot];B[hn];W[ho];B[gn]
;W[in]C[R. Blacks positions fell down.];B[im];W[go]
(;B[fn];W[fo];B[eo];W[fq];B[ep];W[eq];B[ph]C[best to reinforce in corner.]
;W[oi];B[mh];W[oh]
(;B[og]C[R. bad cut, since blacks shape is too heavy, better to push on whites weal group first.]
;W[ng];B[nh];W[nf];B[of];W[ne];B[lj];W[kj];B[mj];W[kk];B[lg]
;W[kh]C[R.weird move, doesnt really helps and  gives black a chance to strike.]
;B[le];W[nc];B[oc]C[very bad shape];W[nd];B[hc]C[I thought this part was really good, white has several groups under pressure


top right black is till in a huge trouble]
(;W[kc]
(;B[cc]C[R Situation is chaotic with alot of weak groups.];W[fe]
;B[he];W[id];B[hd];W[jf]C[R.Big black dragon is sealed now]
;B[kg];W[jg]C[R. well. Now there is just some chaotic fights ) no point in comments ;)

Overall it was a game where black tried to show sharp fangs to white all the time ) but it was way too aggresive in thin so attacker and defender was switched around too often.
I recommend for black to play sometimes more patiently and solidly. Thickness - is very important to attack, dont overplay when you are thin around a board.]
