Hi,

my name is Zoran Rilak, I'm an 8k at KGS.  I will be doing the review for Black.

If you have any additional questions or comments, feel free to contact me at <bruce@tesla.rcub.bg.ac.yu>.]
;W[nq];B[kq]C[Question 1: Is this pincer good enough, or is it too far away? Is m3 better?

--
  It's good enough, if you know the followup joseki variations.  It's one line closer to your D4 stone and gives you a nice settlement in sente should White choose to invade with F3 early on (variation).]

(;W[qn];B[oo]C[--
Good!  Surprisingly many players choose to dig themselves into the corner when doubly approached.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[--
This is the correct direction.];W[qp]
(;B[hp]TR[nq]C[Is this move too high to create a moyo? Is it still invadable?

--
Yes, White can either go F3 then slide into the corner or perform some other mischevious trick later on to decrease your territory.  I think you should leave the bottom left side as is, given that you still have a nice sente response to the F3 invasion as described earlier.

  I think I'd play L5, a one-space jump from your pincer stone, which would both attack the marked White stone and make good prospects for a moyo.  See variation.]
;W[fq];B[fp]C[--
Keep in mind that your strategy here should be to let White take the corner, while you build the wall. Even sacrifice a few points if you must, but finish the exchange in sente and be the first to take take D10.]
;W[eq]
(;B[dq]C[--
E4 would be much more profitable: see variation.  This gives Black too many cutting points.  Sometimes simply accepting the fair exchange can lead to very good results, in handicap games even more so.]
;W[ep];B[eo];W[gp]
(;B[go]C[--
No, by all means, connect :)  See variation.  This is a fairly simple situation, you must have lost your concentration.]
;W[fo];B[fn];W[ho];B[fp]TR[gp]C[Was this response correct? Or is blocking better?

--
This is good, the ko is big and you are the one to open it so White has to be the first to look for threats.  There is also this proverb stating that there are no ko threats early in the game, which means that some of the early kos are more valuable than any possible threat on an empty board.  This is one such ko - White cannot afford to lose it and let Black capture G4, so he'd better connect.  If White threatens elsewhere to retake the ko, you should simply ignore the threat and capture a HUGE corner plus influence.]
;W[gq]C[--
Evidently White knows the same as we do.]
(;B[ip]C[--
Again, connect and agree to a fair exchange: see variation.]
;W[hn];B[cm];W[do]C[Is there any way to respond to this cut properly without losing territory?

-- Sure, force him into an ugly shape with a ladder.  (Variation)]

(;B[cp]LB[cq:A]TR[dq]C[--
Don't make this shape.  It's called "the empty triangle"; marked Black stones share a liberty labelled "A" and that doesn't really contribute in a fight.  There is a go proverb saying "hane at the head of two stones" and its inverse having to do something about being safe to hane when *you* have two stones.]
;W[dn]
(;B[en]LB[fl:B][fm:A]C[--
F7 much better locally: it would make your group safer.  Contrast that with F8 which might look as a faster move, but in this position it would mean disaster.]
;W[dm];B[cn];W[el]LB[fl:A]C[--
You could have tried to get away with an attachment at F8... (variation)]

(;B[hq]TR[en][fn][eo][go][fp]C[--
This is a yose (endgame) move, because Black loses the fight if he loses the marked stones; however, if he saves them, then White will be the one to end up losing his five stones at the bottom.  So in this situtation it is urgent to try and save the marked stones.]
;W[co]
(;B[bo]LB[bp:A]C[--
A very dangerous move!  Enables White to cut and make your life a living hell.  A would have been much better.  Play solid when you are short on liberties and defending.]
;W[dr];B[cr]C[This endangers the b5 stone, but will I lose the prisoners if do not respond like this?
--
There is little you can do now except hope for an opponent's mistake.]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[bn];B[bq];W[ap];B[aq];W[ao];B[cg]TR[dr]C[--
Don't forget the corner lump of stones.  If you don't capture the marked White stone (and it is sente), you will lose 25+ points in score difference - too much to just give away.]
;W[fd];B[db];W[cc]
(;B[cd]LB[dc:A]C[--
I would connect here. See variation.];W[dc];B[ec];W[cb];B[eb]

(;B[mc]TR[pi][qi][pj][qj][pk][qk]SQ[kd]C[Again, is this move too high to create a thick moyo?

--
It's definitely not too high, since it's on the third line.  But where would that moyo be?  For a basic moyo outline you need a stone at the rectangle point and also one at any of the triangled points.  It's still too early to hope for a moyo, although you move does have some territorial potential.  However, if you want to  stop your enemy from gaining score, it is often better to answer by getting the same (or more) as he does, not by stopping his expansion.  Se variation for an illustration of this principle.]
;W[oc]
(;B[od]LB[pc:A]C[--
This is incorrect direction.  See why in the variation.];W[nc]
;B[nd];W[qb];B[pc];W[pb];B[mb];W[ob];B[na]C[--
Not really neccessary.  You should block at R17 instead or simply connect at M16.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[qe];B[qd];W[rc];B[rf]C[--
It looked like you managed to handle it well but you missed the ladder at R14.  This might prove very dangerous later on.]
;W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[og];W[nf];B[qf];W[pe]
(;B[qj]C[--
This has been VERY friendly towards White.  See variation for a more aggressive approach!]
;W[md];B[ng];W[me];B[mf]C[--
Brave but, unfortunately, ineffective.  By this time you should be the first to realize this fight leads nowhere and tenuki (play elsewhere).]

;W[jg]
(;B[nk]LB[pm:A]C[--
good idea, but poor move.  Wouldn't it be much bigger to play somewhere near Q7?  See variation.]
;W[po];B[pn];W[qo];B[no]LB[op:A]C[--
As you opponent shows you in your next move, it was urgent to protect the cut.  In principle don't leave too many cutting points behind you, especially near the corners!]
;W[op];B[mp];W[mq];B[lq];W[pr];B[np];W[oq];B[pm];W[nm]CR[ln]
LB[pl:B][lm:D][on:A][lp:C]TR[pm][pn]C[Is this "invasion" dangerous?

--
That depends only on how you handle it :)  Most "deep-space" invasions are based on one, at most two weaknesses the invader aims to exploit.  When such an invasion happens, take your time and try to identify the possible threats he might try to utilize.  

Here, for example, cutting at A is not a threat.  The marked stones can easily connect or run away.  But nose play at B *is* a possible threat which needs to be evaluated.  Cutting at C is not to be dismissed altogether, either, but only after White has already placed some more stones in this area; right now Black can easily handle that cut with a ladder (see variation).  And finally, White running out at D is something he might like to try.  Black should be able to extricate the weak group at F6 as mentioned earlier, but since you didn't see this we should observe them as dead and focus on White running towards his two stones at H6.

  Once you have all the (im)possible threats identified, think about an answer which would have them all more or less covered, or at least the more direct ones.  Here it would be the loose connection at M6: it defends both the cut at A and makes it more difficult for White to run away.]

(;B[lm]C[--
Not bad either.];W[mn];B[ln];W[lo];B[ko];W[mo];B[lp]C[--
No need.  If White cuts there, you connect at P6 and vice versa. Such points are called "miai" (of equal value).]
;W[ol];B[pl]LB[qm:A]C[--
Better would be to descend at A.  It would secure more points.]
;W[ok];B[oj]LB[nj:A]C[--
Please don't hane unless you need to :)  This White group has no space to make any eyes, so just play solid, extend to A and let it run towards your thick wall all it wants.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[pj];B[pi]LB[oi:A]C[--
This is a cutting-fiest.  It frightens me to even think about White's possible continuations.  Just play at A instead and don't let White threaten inside your area of influence.]
;W[nj];B[oi];W[mk]
(;B[mm]TR[jj]C[Was this move necessary? Or should have I blocked the path to run?

--
This has some meaning, if you wanted to use it to decrease White's possible eye space.  White cannot run here, not very far at least, since you have a neatly placed stone at tengen (center of the board, K10 - marked).  With this, White has one eyeand all you need to do is shut him in tightly with several strong, solid moves.  See variation for a possible play.]
;W[kk]C[--
There is a move which isn't so obvious but it stops White in his tracks.  See variation.]

(;B[lk];W[lj];B[ll];W[kj];B[jk];W[kl]
(;B[jl]C[Is k7 better here?

--
No, not really.  White would still get his way out of there (See variation).]

You could have pushed one move further, there's this hanging capture which would save your endangered group.]

;B[cj];W[ej];B[bl];W[cl];B[ck]C[--
Just connect.  This is obviously a mistake due to lack of concentration.]
;W[bm];B[bk]C[--
A hint: you don't need to connect here unless it's the very end of the game.  That stone is worth about four points and White has to lose sente while capturing it (see why), so you should turn to the bigger points.]

Now White is facing a nice double threat: Black has two extremely good moves, A and B.  Black A takes a hude amount of secure territory plus has a nice followup (hane at O12), while Black B threatens to save the isolated Black stone and severely cripple White's top position.  

As a rule of thumb, always block your opponent in the direction of your nearby stones.  White was foolhardy to play P17 in the first place, right between your two stones.]

This is an even exchange.  Now both Black and White want to play A or B respectively, since it's very big - Black is getting a really huge moyo here - but there are still some unsettled areas on the board, left side for instance.
