AB[dp][pd]C[csh: I played this game against an AGA 5-dan from our club. I felt like I was holding my own, but I have problems with running groups and with the early endgame. I'd appreciate your comments on both. We did not have time to finish the game, but at the end of the game, I felt like I had a slight lead. If we had time to finish the game, though, I think that I probably would have lost ground in the endgame, so I still think the game was within White's reach.

Please review for Black.

Thanks in advance,

Chris

* Hello Chris. My comments start with a star *.];W[cd];B[pp]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[ec]
(;B[dj]C[csh: I wanted to reduce White's potential on the left.

* This is an okay move although...]
(;W[ch];B[pj];W[kq];B[iq]C[csh: This seemed like the correct side to approach from. It protects the left corner, and crowds the white group a little bit.

* Yes it is the correct side to approach from.];W[nq];B[oq]
;W[np];B[pn]
(;W[bp];B[cq]
(;W[dl]TR[dj]LB[ei:A]C[csh: I wasn't worried about my stone yet. I wanted to treat it as a light move, so I didn't think I needed to play on the left yet. I was keeping 'A' in reserve to split the left side. Is this okay?]

(;B[jc]C[csh: Seemed like the biggest move.]
(;W[qf]C[csh: I wasn't sure how to respond. Seemed the kick was the best sequence.

* I think so too.];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[rj]C[csh: I sort of expected this.]

(;B[ri]C[csh: I decided to let White live in exchange for a large lower right corner.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[rh];B[rk];W[si]C[* The White group is alive the thick which is bad for Black.]

(;B[ql]TR[pn]LB[pl:A]C[csh: Seemed better to protect here instead of 'A,' even though the relation of the marked stones looks odd.]
;W[ir]
(;B[hr];W[jr];B[bd]C[csh: Is this the right timing? I wanted to probe and see how White would respond, then either take the corner or split the lefthand side.

* I still think B10 is a better move.];W[bc]
(;B[ei]C[csh: I split the left, but perhaps playing out the corner first would be better. See the variation.

* Compared to B10, this move poses little threat to the C6 group.]
;W[be]LB[cj:a]C[White played here, and suddenly my splitting attack does nothing. The lower group should live if he attaches at 'a.']
;B[bq]
(;W[fl]TR[dj]C[csh: I am very bad at running out with weak groups. It's probably the part of the middlegame that I have the most problems with. I actually played the marked stone to get this type of game on purpose, to help me practice.]

(;B[gc]TR[ei][dj]C[csh: Since my marked stones couldn't be surrounded with one move, I thought the extension was bigger than moving the marked stones out tot the middle. The extension also indirectly helps the marked stones.]

(;W[eh]C[csh: I have no idea how to respond to this move. This is the group that I had problems running out. Any comments about better moves or better shape would be greatly appreciated.]

(;B[gi]LB[fh:B][fi:A]C[csh: I considered 'A,' but it seemed slow. This move invites white 'B.']
;W[fh]
(;B[gj]LB[fi:A]C[csh: I also considered connecting at 'A,' but I don't know which is better.]

(;W[hl];B[jj]C[* H13 might be better.];W[hg];B[ed]LB[jh:A]C[csh: I wanted to complete the shape at 'A,', but I also felt like I needed to reduce White's moyo before the left got too big.]
;W[fd];B[fc]
(;W[ee]LB[gd:A][eb:B]C[* Secondly, I can't see which is better out of A and B. Black should probably tenuki.]
;B[fe];W[dd];B[ge]LB[eb:A]C[csh: White said later that this was a bad sequence, because it took away the sente move at 'A' for Black.

* Black doesn't gain anything from this sequence.];W[ih]C[csh: Now I'm in trouble. I can't find a good move to make shape here.]

(;B[ik]LB[jm:A]C[csh: I played this, looking to bend around the end of the white group at 'A' or so.]
;W[hk];B[hj]C[csh: But White just punishes my shape.];W[il]
;B[jl];W[jm];B[kl];W[ii];B[ij]C[csh: Ugh.

* White just made the Black group safe and strong while getting nothing IMO.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[nc];B[mc];W[mb];B[lb]C[csh: I read the double-hane as being the only playable variation.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc];W[pb]
(;B[rc]C[csh: I played this way, looking to attack the group on the right and then turn my attention to the left. See the variation.]
;W[rb];B[rd]
(;W[nb];B[ld]
(;W[sb];B[rf];W[ph]
(;B[km]LB[im:A]C[csh: I was trying to pressure the white group, and start to make territory in the middle of the board. White suggested that I cut directly at 'A' instead.

* I wouldn't cut in that way unless in desparate situation.]
;W[jn];B[hn];W[in];B[or]C[* P2 is also very big.];W[kn];B[mn]

;W[ni];B[li];W[oj];B[nk];W[ok];B[ol];W[mo];B[on];W[id]
(;B[ic]LB[fb:F][oi:B][bj:A][bo:E][ip:C][ls:D]C[csh: We ran out of time and had to adjourn the game. I did have some questions, though:

1) What are the biggest endgame moves? I labeled some of the moves I was considering for Black. I thought that 'A' and 'C' were the biggest.

* A & C are the biggest moves but Black can only get one of them. A compromise is the C9, C8, H4 sequence.

2) Do you agree with my assessment that Black is slightly ahead?

* Black is way ahead.

3) What other comments do you have about the game?

* Territory and reading are important.

* Every time before making a move, think about this: can I gain anything (more points, better shape, severe threat to the opposition's group etc.) from this move? For example, the 57-62 sequence is bad because White does not gain anything at the end.

* A shape is good only if it can result in more points.

Thanks in advance for the review.
