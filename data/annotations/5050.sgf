C[This is a game I played on the Wing server. In this case I won, but more by luck than judgement.

This is the first time I've carefully reviewed my own game, and it makes me realise how terribly we both played. Instead of trying to be clever, I really need to start playing more humbly and safely. This game looks like a sequence of disasters with the winner determined arbitrarily.

The last time I played this opponent, he won by about 20 points (unfortunately the .sgf didn't save properly, otherwise I would have sent that game).

Hi, 

I haven't played for a while but I believe I'm about 10kyu on KGS. This game was characterized by blacks greediness. Many of his moves were unreasonable. White responded well in the beginning but began to get greedy as well. Often we feel that we are behind and our opponent is making an enormouse amount of territory when that is not actually the case. Then we start making poor moves to try to catch up. But those moves come back to haunt us. If you make a poor shape you will have to fix it up later on. There is no escape. Better to make good shape the first time around. Often that means playing a shape that feels slower than we want to play. However, it means that you do not open yourself up for attach by your opponent. The keyword here is patience.

In your game you made two main errors: (1) poor shape because you want to catch up (even though you were not behind), and (2) forcing your opponent to make strong groups needlessly. Search for alternative ways to solve problems. Find the way that helps your opponent least.

I recommend that you go through some elementary life and death problems because you need to practice your reading (everyone does so that comment is a little redundant), and study up on shape a bit. Understanding shape better will give you more options on settling and connecting stones. This is turn will give you alternatives to consider when figuring out how to achieve your goals on the goban.

I hope this was helpful,


Josh];B[pp];W[dp];B[qd];W[dd]C[I almost always play on the hoshi points as white, because an enclosure seems too passive.

Josh: Patience is a virtue :-)];B[nc]LB[pj:a]C[I figure a play at A would be very big for black, taking most of the side and starting a moyo in the top right, which obviously I didn't want to happen.

Josh: Good thinking. (a) is a good point, so is R10. R10 will allow you to create a solid base. You can create a safe group using Q10, it is just a little more flexible because it is further from the edge.]
;W[pj];B[mq];W[qf];B[ql];W[qj];B[fq]C[I really wasn't sure how to respond to this kikasi.

I looked like black was getting the entire bottom edge, and I couldn't let him take the corner as well.

Josh: Black is over-reaching. His corners are not as strong as they could be, and it is possible to reduce them. F3 invites a pincer. I would play high pincer because you are unlikely to make a base on the bottom. So I would probably play J4 or K4.]
;W[eq]LB[dn:b][fp:a][jq:c]C[I chose this response because I learned the exchange bA, wB, bC in the absence of other stones. In this case, I figured that black C would be too inefficient to actually play, but that not doing so could leave some vulnerability to use in a reduction.

Josh: Sorry but this is a terrible move. E3 is helping F3 to settle his stones easily, and it is going to make reducing the bottom right corner more dificult in the future. Furthermore, E3 does not protect the corner because black can later invade at C3.]
;B[fp];W[dn]
(;B[di]C[Josh: Black has been very greedy so far, but this is too much. He has left too many gaps in his groups so it is time for white to attack. Black should have secured the bottom; Then it would be strong and white could not gain much by attacking.]

(;W[kc]LB[hc:a]TR[qf][pj][qj]C[This seemed like a good chance to take territory and deny black the top edge because bA would be much more dangerous for him than for me (I could run with 16 to the triangle group if necessary).

Josh: Poor play by white. Getting greedy as well. C14 would be better because it strengthens the corners and squeezes black so there is little room to make a base.]
;B[re]C[I don't really understand why he played this move at this time.]

(;W[rf]C[I was too scared to tenuki.];B[md]C[Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought this was a pretty poor move by black. It helped me to strengthen 16, which I wanted to do anyway.

Josh: This only helps white. Black should have invaded because white is so weak on the top. Then black can chase white into the center, and use a splitting attack against the top and the right groups.]
;W[ke]LB[hd:a]C[But maybe this was a pretty poor move by me in response. Maybe A would have been better?

Josh: strengthening would have been better. However, L17 was too far initially, so it is difficult to really strengthen it well. K17 would have work better now.]
;B[cf]LB[cc:a]C[IMO, he would have done better to keep the option of A for later, rather than giving me a chance to consolidate.]
;W[cd];B[cl]C[At this point I was prematurely counting the top left as my territory. Also, I was very worried about him building a moyo along the bottom and bottom-right.]
;W[cm]C[So I played this move, even though it's obviously bad shape, because I wanted to get sente.]
;B[dl]C[Sure enough, I didn't feel like I needed a reply to that.]
;W[ip]C[My attempt to limit the moyo.];B[fn]C[I was too worried about life for 26 to worry about my poorly-formed group in the bottom left.]
;W[lp]TR[qf][rf][pj][qj]C[My ultimate aim here was to run to the triangle group.]
;B[kr]LB[mp:a]C[Am I right in thinking he should have played at A here? That would be tough for me.

Josh: Black at (a) would have been poor shape for black; It is call "pushing the cart from behind". Basically it is bad because he would be helping you to strengthen you stones and move toward the open center. The merit of L2 is that it prevents you from settling your stones on the side, although that would probably have been difficult in any case.]
;W[mp];B[nq]
(;W[oo]TR[ql]C[I didn't want to make him too strong along the bottom and also I was wondering if I could threaten the triangle stone.

Josh: Unfortunately, this does make black stronger in the corner. Playing to the left would have been better because black is strong enough anyway over there. Later, you could invade at R6.]
;B[po];W[on];B[pm];W[ol]C[I figured that was where he wanted to play, and hoped I would be strong enough to survive the peep.

Josh: Blacks shape is stronger. This is not a good idea. You have also forced black to make the bottom right corner incredibly strong. This is not a good outcome for white.]
;B[om];W[nm];B[nl];W[ok];B[nn];W[mm];B[no];W[np];B[op]C[Sacrificing two stones isn't the end of the world, but I could feel that I'd botched it.

So where did I go wrong?

Josh: P8.];W[im]LB[gd:a]C[I don't think there was any chance of my white group dying, so maybe I should have played at A instead?

Josh: That would have been better. Or, G17.];B[jp];W[jo];B[iq]

(;W[io];B[kp];W[ko];B[lq]
(;W[mo];B[pn];W[mn]C[I just feel that sequence was really ugly!]
;B[jd]C[I've noticed before that the opponent really loves playing peeps. It seems like a good move here anyway.

Josh: Perhaps better to ignore it.]
(;W[kd];B[fc]C[Doh! This was where I realised what an idiot I had been not to firm up that territory earlier.]
;W[fd]TR[cf][di][cl][dl]C[I wanted to cut him off from the triangle group. I figured I couldn't kill but I might get some compensation from a chase.

Josh: Don't attack by attaching, it only helps your opponent to strengthen their group. E15 would be better for splitting, but then black can easily make a base on the side, maybe even enough for life.]
;B[gd];W[fe]
(;B[ic]LB[ec:a]C[Surely A was a much better move? I think he wanted eyespace, but a kosumi seems like the worst possible choice here.]
;W[jc]C[Josh: Not good. You should settle the corner with E17.]
;B[ie];W[ib]C[This was when I started to think maybe I could kill a part of it.]
;B[hc];W[ec];B[hb];W[jb]C[I thought long and hard about this move. If the group lived (which still seemed most likely) it would have been completely pointless.]
;B[be]C[Another (in my opinion, inappropriate) kosumi.];W[bd]
;B[cq]C[My own bad shape catches up with me again. Why did I think I had enclosed the corner?

Josh: Told ya ;-)];W[er]
(;B[bn];W[bm]C[I thought that if my group lived, I'd have two pretty large yose!]
;B[bo];W[dm]C[Josh: Terrible shape. Try to find better ways to solve problems like this. (hint: there is a better shape for this problem and it involves attack black in the corner)]

(;B[cr]C[I didn't expect this, since it seemed black was already alive. I was pretty grateful though.]

[fq]C[Capturing the triangle stones was a bonus I hadn't forseen until now.]
;B[hr]
(;W[gq];B[ir];W[gr]C[The sequence ended in gote though, and I've lost all my territory in the bottom left, so I think I would have been pretty screwed if he'd played OK from now on.]
;B[hl]C[Another thank-you kosumi! (IMHO)]
(;W[jj]LB[il:a]TR[mm][nm][mn][io][jo][ko][mo][ip][lp][mp][np]
C[This was a bit of a stupid move. I probably should have played A, but I just felt that I wanted to use the triangle thickness more quickly.

Josh: (a) is "pushing the cart". K9 is better. However, even better would be to attack, even if lightly.]
;B[mf];W[kg]C[I'd mostly forgotten that group. Good job I had somewhere to run to!]
;B[jk]TR[hb][fc][hc][ic][gd][jd][ie]C[This is where I realised my mistake in overextending, but it forced me to think more carefully and see the remaining weakness of the triangle group.]
;W[ij];B[il];W[fb];B[gc]C[Josh: Black should be more mindful of the life of his group. Running would be better.]
;W[id]
(;B[je]C[Josh: Silly.];W[he]C[I managed to limit him to a false eye, but I was worried about him escaping out the left.]
;B[ge];W[hf]C[He could have run here but...];B[hd]C[A completely free move! Yippee!]
;W[gf]C[Even though I played terribly, he played a bit worse and I came out on top!]
;B[jf];W[kf];B[jg];W[gh]C[Probably the right side needed strengthening more than the left.]

;B[gi];W[fh];B[kj];W[fj]TR[hi][hj][ij][jj]C[Sheer luck that I didn't lose the triangle group here, as I hadn't thought it through too carefully.]
;B[ll];W[aj]C[This looked too big to resist, but I should have remembered "urgent before big".]
;B[bj];W[ak];B[bk];W[bl];B[ai];W[al]C[And it ended in sente, which I hadn't expected!]

(;B[bh]C[I had spotted a nasty variation here.];W[ei]C[This was to protect against that attack.]
;B[qh]C[Yet again, I'd been prematurely counting territory. I hadn't imagined this attack.]
;W[of];B[pg]C[He loves kosumi and peeping, so I guess he couldn't resist having both together.]

[pk:b]TR[pj][qj][ok][ol]C[If he had played something other than those kosumi, I'm sure he could have killed me here. Instead, I was starting to feel a bit more confident although I was still  worried about how he could seal off the triangle stones using a threat to cut at A and B]

I think I learned quite a lot just by going through it myself, but of course a stronger players comments would be even more valuable.
