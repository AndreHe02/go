C[Dear reviewer,



In this game I was under attack and could have been killed for quite a bit but somehow I managed to live. In the middle of the game my opponent resigned and said I was not 'playing go'. I'm greatly affected by this comment and would like to know whether or not my play can be improved and whether or not he speaks the truth. Thanks,

BB: Looks like a game of go to me.];B[dd]C[Flameinice [3k\]: hi]
;W[pd];B[qp];W[co];B[oq]C[I was thinking of closing the corner at d3 but I remembered the saying 'do not let your opponent close two corners' and so approached D16. Was this okay?

BB: Yes. A move like c5 emphasises the left side. It's like saying to Black, you can have the corner, but I'm going to get a big left side. Of course, by this logic, it's already out of place, because Black has the top left corner. And also Black's stone in the top left is on 4-4, which is settled, so here you could actually enclose that bottom left corner. In summary, I don't think c5 was great.]
;W[cf];B[fd]C[BB: This is a fun move by Black. He could start a really interesting fight by invading the left side, and he has no weakness to worry about - the bottom right is strong and the top left is very light.]
;W[dj]C[BB: Nice. Now you have a flexible side. c4 can only be captured at great cost (many moves).]
;B[qj]C[BB: Boring! The bottom right is settled, and low, the top right is settled enough. This is big, but by no means urgent. The top side on the other hand, is interesting. A white move at h17 puts Black under a lot of pressure. A black move at l17 defends, attacks, and is big. The top is urgent. You should now play at l17 or h17. L17 is good because Black pretty much has to play the inefficient move of j17.]
;W[jc]C[BB: I think this goes a little too far. If Black responds h17, fine, but otherwise you haven't *really* put pressure on Black (not like h17 would), and this way you've left room for Black to invade (m17 + o17 makes a base).]
;B[jq]C[BB: Oh my god. Boring! Black is low on this side! If Black want to ignore the top left, the best way is either r14 of e4. For you now, I would suggest c17 or e4/d3. Or perhaps r14.]
;W[jo]C[Should I have played D3 instead? I was afraid of black's development and so played this first.

BB: Yes, this is a little thin. A pro might be able to pull it off, but only because he could read the next 50 moves. There's no territory in the centre, so what are you trying to achieve? You can't attack k3, obviously. And if you want to attack the top left, wasting a move here is... a waste of a move. Just attack if you want to attack.]
;B[dq]C[BB: Black has the right idea here. The corner has been ripe for the taking. That said, like I said before: attack this stone now to make a wall facing the left side. I think e4 is urgent.]

(;W[fq]C[I did not see d5 until it was too late.

BB: Tesuji smesuji! Black simply has too much space to live. He doesn't have another weak group around, and there is k3 which definitely offers support. See variation.]
;B[do]C[How to continue from here?

BB: I don't know. You're the one who got into this mess. Okay, I'm just kidding. Let's think strategically (you sure don't want to try to kill Black because your territory will be decimated)...

You don't want to let f3 die on a big scale. One goal should be to get reasonably strong on both sides while keeping Black weak. This would be an asset for you...

You can't let c5 dies, because then Black will be strong, and so you will be weak on both sides...

You could potentially let Black live in gote, get strong on both sides and then attack the top left...

Locally, d6 seems like the obvious move....];W[dn];B[eo]
(;W[cm]C[BB: I was thinking c4. Even if you want to connect here, c6 is the right way. This way, Black c4 is *much* better. See var.]
;B[cp];W[hp]C[BB: What does this do? Black is strong on both sides.]
;B[lp];W[qg]C[BB: Should be at r14. Black has invasion potential in the top right.]
;B[oj];W[pk];B[pj];W[pn]C[Run out at O8 instead?

BB: The thing about a forcing move (q9) is that you can let it get captured and it still costs you nothing. You don't want to invade here, you want to reduce. If you want to invade, try s4.This move is just asking to be captured on a large scale. You already have weak stones on the bottom side. Black should play a move m6, which threatens both sides.]

(;B[nl]C[BB: See variation. This isn't the best move by Black. It's too close to his own strength above. White m6 would be good now.]
;W[nn]C[BB: Again, this just asks Black to capture you on a large scale.]
;B[lm]C[BB: NO! Black should play at m6!];W[ln]C[BB: Now you've got coherence, if not connection.]

My opponent resigned here. In spite of the fact that I'm prone to attack and black's moyo could expand with attacking I feel as if I'm leading here. Can you please a.) give me a rough count of territory, b.) tell me how to improve my play and c.) tell me whether or not I was 'playing go'. I know I shouldn't let comments get to me, but I've never had someone tell me this before and am a little shaken by the bluntness. I'd greatly appreciate your views.



Thanks for reviewing,

Flameinice

BB:
Q a) You'd get a lot more out of my answer to this question if you answered it first. In fact, I suggest before even reading my answer, you try to answer it and the see where your answer differs from mine.

Black has territory in the bottom right and bottom left. White has territory on the left and top.

Black's lower left, assuming W b5 in sente and e2 in sente, 6 points.

Black's lower right, assuming White o2, o3, p1 and t5, 12 points.

White's left side, assuming reduction from around d12, plus Black b5, b6, b7, b15, 13 points.

White's top side, assuming reduction from both sides and above, 4 points.

Top left and top right don't count because either could be invaded at the 3-3 point. Which is just another way of saying it's not the endgame yet and neither player should be resigning.

But from this little analysis that I can achieve, it looks like W has 17 point and B has 18 points. Which also makes it look like no one should be resigning yet.

Black should either play c16, if he thinks he's ahead, or r17, if he thinks he's behind.

Q b) Recognise the meaning of moves like c5.

Recognise that a move halfway between two good moves is often worse than either. Examples are k17, which was too far away from Black to attack, but too far away from White to be secure. Also q6, which was too deep to be reduction, but not deep enough to be invasion, and so in the end you had to try to live without a base.

Make sure your moves have a meaning. h4 saved one stone without threatening anything, and left a great weakness that Black could use by playing h6.

Play away from strength: e.g. r13 was too close to Black's strong stones. r14 would secure the top right better. Especially given the thinness around o17.

Make solid connections when you have support and can't be attacked. c7 should be at c6.

Q c) Get over it. I suggest getting a friend or just someone you know to insult you for 5 minutes or so as practice, and just ignore everything they say.

I always just tell myself I honestly thought I was doing the best I could, and that's good enough for me. If I suck, it's because I suck, and that's not my fault. Or if it *is* my fault, at least I'm *trying* to do something about it.]

(;W[ep]C[BB: Black's stones are low. Take advantage of this.]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[fq];W[ef]C[BB: e14 might not be the best move locally, but note how it works to create a moyo and pressure Black at the same time. Black can't counter attack with c12 now, running will be harder, and a White invasion will work better. (It would be nice if k17 were at h17 though.)]
