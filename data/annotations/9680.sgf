AB[pd][dp]C[nytewalker:
It says my rating is 12k, but my rank is still normalizing on KGS.

I've only played 3 games, once against a Bot at Speed Go, which resulted in me getting distracted and losing when time ran out. The second was against a 17k and I didn't realize when I joined that it wanted to give him 4 stones, I won but that really skewed my ranking. This is my third game on KGS, but I gave him at least 2 stones, since even I'm not sure of where I stand.

I have no groups in my area to do game review with, but I'm in the process of getting a go club going. I would appreciate any feedback I can get to improve my game. I've supplied my thoughts on various parts of the game in my post game review.

bbr: hello, I'm Alex and I'll be reviewing your game. I play as bbr on KGS so my comments are prefixed with "bbr:"

To begin I'd like to recommend to you to study beginners pages at senseis library:
http://senseis.xmp.net/?BeginnerStudySection

It's pretty comprehensive material for a beginning player.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg]C[bbr: All in all, not a good choice. You force your opponent to build a wall facing left, where he already has a stone (D16). Id rather approached from the other side (O17) or moved into a corner - R17 instead of Q13]
;B[dj];W[fp]C[bbr: it's a big mistake (or an overplay). one can use high approach when it benefits the whole board position, but this position is not the case. low approach (F3) is used 99% of the time]
;B[pe];W[qd]C[nytewalker:
This seems to be an overplay.... He's obviously going to split, and then I'm loosing stones.

bbr: yes, huge mistake. only options here are either to protect (R13 or R12), extend at p13, jump into corner - R17, or just to play elsewhere.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[rg];B[qg]C[nytewalker:
This is plain stupidity on my part and oversight... playing too fast, and not looking..]
;W[qh];B[rd]SQ[qd][re]C[nytewalker:
I know the top ones are dead, so I go to secure what little I do built.]
;W[rh]C[bbr: a mistake. Q13 stone is much more important.];B[se]
C[bbr: your opponent basically played a pass. he should've cut a q12 - a local vital point.]
;W[dq]C[still top is more important];B[qc]C[bbr: another pass from your opponent. he made two pass moves - basically, you got your 2 stones of handicap back.]
;W[fc];B[do]C[bbr: another almost a pass];W[cq];B[dm]C[bbr: one more pass. this move does almost nothing]
;W[cf]C[bbr: good];B[bo]C[bbr: *sigh* another pass.];W[ci]C[bbr: a mistake. do not touch a single stone without necessity. C17 is the biggest move currently.]
;B[df];W[dg];B[ef];W[ce]C[bbr: good];B[de];W[di]TR[cc][ic][jc]
[id][eg][og][cj][nq]C[bbr: a mistake. black cannot cut. better moves are marked]
;B[eg];W[eh];B[cg];W[dh];B[fd];W[dc]SQ[cg]C[nytewalker:
I thought it might have been bad to play up top and leave this stone sitting inside, it does come back to haunt me.

bbr: yes. just pull back with a G17 instead.];B[cd];W[be]C[bbr: bad. proper move is to capture with B13]
;B[cc];W[db];B[cb];W[jd]SQ[fd]C[nytewalker:
I think I can get more territory out here, but the marked stone probably makes this a dangerous move.

bbr: yes, an overplay. just G17 would be ok.];B[gc];W[fb];B[gb]
;W[gd]C[bbr: useless. your group is dead. see variation.]
(;B[fe]LB[ga:A][hd:B]C[nytewalker:
A is where I played... and I think I lost ground for it... I think B should have been better in order to connect to my other stone and trap the two stones inside.

bbr: it's a mistake from b.];W[ga];B[hd];W[ge]C[bbr: your stone is captured in a ladder. see variation]

(;B[he];W[gf];B[hc];W[hb]C[bbr: your stones are still dead.]

(;B[gg];W[hf];B[ie]LB[ib:A][ig:B]TB[qd][re]C[nytewalker:
I didn't see the net this was heading for.... So I ended up loosing everything in this corner.]

(;W[ib];B[ig];W[if];B[jf];W[gh]TR[lb][lc][mc]C[nytewalker:
Playing to reduce blacks inside influence.

bbr: doesnt matter. you should've saved the top. its still dead]
;B[ff]C[bbr: and another pass];W[fj]C[bbr: still should've played at the top]
;B[hg]C[bbr: paaasss];W[hh]TR[cl][dl][el]C[bbr: pass from you.

if you want to attack left stones. just play marked moves. 
and top is still the most important place. your stones are still dead]
;B[je]C[bbr: pass];W[ic]TR[lb][lc][mc]C[bbr: too slow. jump to build the form]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[id];W[jc]TR[kb][lc]C[nytewalker:
The following works sort of in whites favor for building territory at the top, but lots of black influence on the outside... And the whole things looks sloppy.

bbr: marked moves are better to build a form still.];B[lc];W[ld]
;B[ke];W[mc];B[md];W[lb];B[le];W[lc]TR[nc][nd]C[bbr: not needed. marked moves instead]
;B[nc];W[nd];B[me];W[oc];B[ne];W[nb];B[od];W[nc]C[bbr: again, not needed. group is alive already]
;B[pc];W[pb]C[bbr: again, pass.];B[da];W[ea]C[bbr: very small. after your group is alive and well, right or the bottom are the biggest places to play.]
;B[ca]LB[ec:A]TR[qm][kq]C[nytewalker:
Here's the save point... But I panicked and lost everything...

bbr: just let go. it's mere 10 points. marked moves are like 20+ points each.]
;W[fa];B[ec];W[ha];B[eb];W[ng]TR[nh][oi]C[nytewalker:
This is my attempt and reducing blacks influence in the middle.

bbr: it's not an influence. its a clump of stones. but what would you do if black cuts a Q12?
marked moves are better];B[mg];W[mh];B[lg];W[lh];B[kh]TR[oh]
C[bbr: P12 is your weakness now.];W[jh]C[nytewalker:
This jump was probable unnecessary/risky, and cost me sente]
;B[ih];W[kg]C[bbr: and what if black extends?]
(;B[jg];W[ki];B[kf];W[kh];B[ii]C[nytewalker:
Black crawls in... I feel like I should have been able to put a stop to this sooner...]
;W[kk]C[Too lax on the infiltration?];B[hj];W[fl];B[ik];W[km]
;B[hl];W[gm];B[hm];W[gn];B[hn];W[ho];B[io];W[jo];B[cl];W[bj]
;B[hp];W[go];B[bg]SQ[be][ce][cf]C[nytewalker:
I don't know how I should have answered this... or if as soon as this was played I lost the marked stones.]
;W[bh]C[nytewalker:
This doesn't seem like the correct way to attack the stones, or maybe it was already too late....]
;B[ae];W[af];B[bd];W[ad];B[ac]C[nytewalker:
I realize at this point how badly I've screwed up, and start to make sure I have territory...]
;W[ag];B[ae];W[bk];B[bf];W[ah];B[cp];W[bl];B[bq];W[cr];B[bm]
;W[al];B[am];W[cj];B[dk];W[el];B[dl];W[ej]SQ[en]C[nytewalker:
This move unneecessary? I think peeking here might have been better for me in keeping sente

bbr: yes. your stones are connected already];B[en];W[eo]TR[ip]
[fq]C[bbr: marked moves are better for protection.];B[ep];W[fo]
TR[fq]C[bbr: just let go of this stone. connect instead.];B[eq]
;W[fq];B[er];W[fr];B[dr]C[bbr: congrats. you saved one stone and lost 15+ points.]
;W[ip];B[ds];W[in]TR[kp]C[bbr: no need to capture

protect instead];B[mp]C[nytewalker:
Too much area I'm covering.. this infiltration I don't know how to handle even though I'm strong on most sides, my first thought is prevent him from making a base.]
;W[kp]TR[on][kq][oq]C[bbr: marked moves are better];B[op];W[oq]
TR[po][pq]C[bbr: again, makred moves. your hane allows b to make a shape]
;B[po];W[oo];B[np];W[no]TR[qp]C[nytewalker:
This is just a bad move it seems... I'm in good shape for a ladder if he presses it, so I must of only been thinking "Kill the stones"

bbr: marked move. see variation for b that makes live]
(;B[qp];W[pq];B[qn];W[pn];B[qo];W[om]C[nytewalker:
He's got a base now on the right.. and potential on the bottom I go back and fix a cut now that both could be in trouble.]
;B[pm];W[on];B[pl];W[qk];B[pk];W[pj]TR[ql][qq]C[bbr: marked moves]
;B[ql];W[rk];B[ph];W[og];B[nk];W[mk];B[oj];W[pi];B[mj];W[ni]
;B[ml];W[lk];B[ol]TR[mn][mo]C[bbr: congrats. you got yourself killed.]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[nj]SQ[nm][om][on][pn][no][oo]C[nytewalker:
This was a pointless move, especially with the soon to be dead stones sitting inside of black.]
;B[mm];W[mo]C[nytewalker:
I don't realize its dead...];B[lo];W[ln];B[mn];W[rl];B[nn];W[rn]
;B[ro];W[rm];B[so];W[sn];B[nq]SQ[pp][oq][pq]C[nytewalker:
Little proud of making this live in the corner, I really need to focus on life and death, judging by the stones I've lost]
;W[or];B[nr];W[qq];B[rq];W[rr]C[bbr: you are dead. see variation.]

(;B[os];W[ps]C[bbr: still dead]
(;B[ns];W[qr]SQ[sr][rs]C[nytewalker:
I know I'm alive now, with two plays to make this live, luckily he gives me the larger territory one.]
;B[rs];W[sr];B[sq];W[lq];B[lr];W[kr];B[ls];W[ks];B[lm];W[kn]
;B[lp];W[mf];B[lf];W[nf];B[of];W[qf];B[jl];W[jm]SQ[kl]C[I think I responded the wrong way here, and should have been more worried about him linking up.]
;B[kl];W[jj];B[im];W[jk]TR[ll]C[nytewalker:
I want to play there, but I never get sente to do so...];B[ko]
;W[jn];B[jq]
(;W[jr];B[kq]SQ[iq]C[bbr: marked move]
(;W[jp];B[mq];W[iq]SQ[jm][km][in][jn][kn][ln][jo][ip][jp][kp]
C[So ugly, but I saved it from being captured as well...];B[lq]
;W[gk]TR[ll]C[I'd forgotten about that play, and here I'm trying to find a way to cut this life line and isolate the bottom stones, but other than making him reinforce I don't get anywhere..]
;B[hk];W[ij];B[hi];W[gi];B[ll];W[qb];B[rb];W[ra];B[sb];W[fh]
C[nytewalker:
Kept my point, but I left a bad cut at the bottom...];B[ir]
C[nytewalker:
I left a cut point... and lost more points.];W[hr];B[js];W[hs]
;B[ek];W[fk];B[em];W[hq];B[gl]TR[gj][fm]SQ[ej][fj][fk][gk][el]
[fl]C[nytewalker:
This filled a neutral point, I didn't feel worried since the marked stones I could connect to either side and save, but answering now wouldn't get me any points.]
;W[fs];B[is];W[sg];B[sf];W[oi];B[ok];W[ji];B[qg]C[nytewalker:
Ok I know this Ko fight is worth only a single point. But knowing I'd made so many mistakes in my walls, I wanted him to start tearing any threats I had left apart so that I could be made aware of them. And as follows he played along.]
;W[be];B[ce];W[qf];B[sa];W[qa];B[qg];W[jr];B[kr];W[qf];B[oa]
;W[ob];B[qg];W[rc];B[sc];W[qf];B[gj]TR[ei][fi][fm]C[nytewalker:
Now that I look at this again, there's more places I can connect, but I do lose a point by filling either top. So it was probably right to fill the bottom one now.]
;W[fm];B[cn]C[nytewalker:
So he's done playing with Ko threats now, so I oblige and fill the ko. I had thought earlier of filling this point, but after looking at it I didn't see a path that lead to anything except dead stones for me.]

bbr: the game has a lot (a ton) of mistakes from both players - in reading as well in please read the beginning pages at Sensei's library and practice at Life and Death problems - there are a ton of freely available sites and applications. That's all of advices I can give you for now.
