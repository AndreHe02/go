C[[Malweth\] - The game looks lucky for White. Black had a number of options to aim for a huge center territory. You should focus on keeping a line out to the center more. The corner territory is big, but not at the expense of giving your opponent much thickness.]
;B[dp];W[pc];B[dd];W[qp]C[[Malweth\]: Although this move is used in pro games, I'm not a fan of it because it gives Once she approaches, black gets too good a direction in the opening.]
;B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[qn];B[jp];W[fc]C[[Malweth\]: This is the wrong direction. White should play at C6 to open up the Black moyo. It also forces Black to defend on the lower side, which will concentrate his stones in one section of the board.

Playing F17 too early might mean that you will be unable to play C14 as a follow-up to C6.]
;B[df];W[db];B[cc];W[ic];B[pe]C[[Malweth\]: Variations at this node discuss common joseki where B plays R17 next. 

These variations are not in context with the whole board!]
(;W[ph]C[[Malweth\]: If you don't know joseki, you should play what you can and learn the joseki after the game...

From a whole board scenario, this pincer shows why F17 was incorrect:

Q12 doesn't work well with the completed lower right (development is uninteresting from a low stone)

Q12 around O16 has the same problem with J17.

Therefore the choice in the upper left wasn't optimal.
---

I don't know anything about this joseki. If this were a serious game, I might have done something simpler, but I felt it was worth trying. I think black''s R17 is joseki, after that I'm not sure where/when it all breaks down.]
;B[qc]C[[Malweth\]: This move is quite common. The first thought should always be to hane.]

(;W[pd]C[[Malweth\]: This is generally bad. You're bumping Black, forcing her into good shape (hitting on the head of 2 stones).]
;B[qd];W[qe];B[qf];W[re];B[rf];W[oe];B[pf];W[qb];B[rd]C[[Malweth\]: So far you're doing well here...]
;W[ne]C[[Malweth\]: The continuation is always to play S17!!! It's sente and not aji keshi because the two white stones have no other life left in them.]
;B[qj];W[rh]C[[Malweth\]: This is too small... play C6 now!]
;B[qh]C[[Malweth\]: I can't think of any reason why Black would play this.

It's obvious that the important stone is R10. Jumping out to P10 makes the most sense... Q14 can flee easily and is alive when B plays S18.

The R10 move was odd in the first place... Black is trying to make small territory on the side when moves like C9 are open!]
;W[qi];B[qg];W[pi]
(;B[og]C[[Malweth\]: Black got herself into the position of needing to run... but even so, the stones are totally alive, so playing elsewhere would be best!]
;W[ok]C[S10 instead looks good too. Otherwise B is left with the aji of S10.]
;B[pk]C[[Malweth\]: B should start with S10 if she wants to do something here.

She shouldn't want to do something here with BIG MOVES on the board!!]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[pj];B[pm];W[qk]C[[Malweth\]: White is looking overconcentrated... but you can't complain since Black gave it to you and gained nothing.]
;B[qm];W[cn]C[[Malweth\]: Finally.];B[om];W[fq]C[[Malweth\]: I like C9 better. It takes the potential Black territory and keeps a center outlook.]
;B[eo];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[jd]C[[Malweth\]: Black is ignoring the situation. E7 is correct joseki to attack F3.]
;W[kc]C[[Malweth\]: You could think of F5 maybe, or play E7 yourself.]

;W[si];B[sg];W[jq]C[[Malweth\]: I like J4 better! This looks like it's aiming for territory. J4 works better with F3.]

;B[eq];W[fs];B[ro];W[rp];B[rn];W[dr]C[[Malweth\]: This is pretty big, but it's hard to play it knowing what happens next.]
;B[cl]C[[Malweth\]: Black has a lot of power on the left half of the board now!!]
;W[mm]C[[Malweth\]: This move makes no sense (you're not attacking anything). Black has a lot of power building up on the left... you need a way to negate it!]

As you can see from those variations, the hane is the answer. It prevents B from reaching further into the corner and keeps the pressure of the pincer up.]
