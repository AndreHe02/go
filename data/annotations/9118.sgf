C[Hi thanks for reviewing. I am B.

-Hi there g0sti0r,

I'm 2dan on KGS and 3d on tygem though I don't play as often right now. I don't know your exact rank but it seems a lot of your weaknesses facing white comes from passive play and fear of what white can do. You guys had a fairly identical scaping out of two sides of the board and yet white always got more. The key part of that is the difference between when you played in his sphere of influence and when he played in yours. You ended up with a weak group who had no points and he got a large corner.

You also had a lot of slow moves compared to him. I think those are the big things you should look at improving because after the opening, he had a large advantage. Another thing that will come with better reading is seeing moves that do more than one thing. So I'd say work on your reading cause it also helps you not fear what can happen and work on your fuseki.

Hope this helped! If you have any questions, email me.

- This is a fine move. White played a passive approach and you are building the right/bottom while he is building left/top.]

-If you are scared to play in white's sphere of influence then you don't have to. He is building his side and you are building yours. You could even play tengen instead right now.]

-Your group isn't that "weak". It can survive I believe at many points but this is a good point so white can't further increase his moyo. B11 is still good as well for later.]
