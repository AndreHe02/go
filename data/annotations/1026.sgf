C[I lost this game without really realizing what I was doing wrong until it was too late. I think the problem is my first invasion. I'd like some feedback on how to go about reducing the B framework in a better way...

Thanks, M.];B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[qf];W[nc];B[pj];W[cn]
C[** Nothing remarkable so far.];B[dk];W[en];B[fp];W[bp];B[cq]
;W[bk];B[jq]LB[gn:A][ko:B][kp:C][jd:D][qq:E]C[** a-e are some other possibilities for white's next move.]
;W[np]C[** A kakari against the stair-point stone is also natural,
which one is best I am not sure, although perhaps the
right is black's weaker side.];B[pn];W[pq];B[qq];W[qr]CR[np]
C[** It's natural to try to get settled in the corner, but
this move is out of balance with O4, I think. Once
you play O4 you place less emphasis on the corner
territory.];B[oq];W[pr];B[op]CR[np];W[qp];B[qo];W[rq];B[or]
LB[rp:A]C[** Not sure if this, a, or tenuki is best. But white gets a
rather forlorn result here. Compare it to entering at
the 3-3 point directly, for example.];W[ro];B[rn];W[qm];B[so]
;W[rp];B[qn]LB[gn:A]C[** With this moyo, I think white a is the only move. It is
also the junction point between white's and black's two
frameworks.];W[ck]CR[dd]C[** I think this is not so big when the stone at the top is
white. Think about black's possible moves here - he
can't achieve a lot on the left anyway.];B[gn]C[** Extremely big.]
;W[jo]C[** Feels dangerous, black is very thick in this area.]
;B[ip]LB[jm:A]C[** Probably ok, something like a would lead to a fight that
black might not win.];W[lp]LB[jl:A]C[** Dangerous, and much too close to the thickness.
There are no eyes along the edge here.];B[jm];W[mm]LB[km:A]
[lm:B]C[** Now white must hope for the best. a and b are alternatives.
It's important to get out quickly, and you should be ready to
give up something. After a you could follow up with a double
hane, for example.];B[mk]LB[lk:A][ll:B]C[** Could be better at a or b to try to push white to
the right.];W[nk];B[nj];W[nl];B[ok];W[ol];B[ql];W[lk];B[mj]
;W[kl];B[km];W[lm]C[** White has escaped, and while the result is not magnificent,
he can be fairly satisfied with having reduced black's moyo.
The main issue next is what will happen at the top and on the
left.];B[ki]LB[fc:A]C[** I'm not sure black gains a lot by chasing white here,
personally I would wait, and just play something like a.];W[jl]
;B[im];W[jj];B[hk]C[** This is definitely from the wrong side.]
;W[ji];B[kg];W[kh];B[lh];W[jh];B[lg];W[gi];B[fj];W[dj]LB[fd:A]
C[** How about just a?];B[fi];W[jd]C[** Yes.];B[kd];W[ke]LB[kc:A]
[jc:B][je:C]C[** There is no point in trying to cut here. White's
only worry should be to keep the white group below
out in the open.];B[jc];W[je];B[ic];W[gc];B[ld];W[le]LB[lb:A]
[pf:B][rd:C]C[** No point in this, the black positions below are too
solid to be affected. a-c or something on the left would
have been better.];B[md];W[me];B[nd]C[** Ouch.];W[oc];B[oe]
;W[rd]C[** White loses sente.];B[he]CR[jd][je][le][ke][me]C[** Another problem with white's way of playing is that
the group now has become big and difficult to give up.];W[qh]
C[** The wrong time to create one more group. White
should make himself safe first.];B[pf];W[pk];B[oj];W[qk];B[pl]
;W[rg];B[rk];W[rf]CR[kh][jh][ji][jj][lk][kl][jl][mm][lm][nk]
[nl][ol][np][lp]C[** Again white gives up sente. White's big group
doesn't quite have two eyes, so he should be more
careful.];B[if]LB[gh:A]C[** Could also play a to enclose white.]
;W[ne]C[** Optimistic.];B[od];W[ng];B[ph];W[qi];B[qj];W[pi]
;B[oh];W[oi];B[ni];W[nh];B[of];W[lb];B[kb];W[lc];B[mc];W[mb]

;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[db];W[bd]C[** Bad.];B[de]
;W[cf];B[ed]CR[gc]C[** Swallowing up the whole top is huge, what used
to be white territory is now black.];W[eq];B[ep];W[bq];B[br]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[fe];B[df];W[hd];B[id];W[ie];B[hf];W[ff];B[gg]
;W[fg];B[gh]LB[fh:A]C[** a would capture the group at the top.]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[cg];B[ec];W[fh];B[hi]LB[gj:A]C[** Necessary since white a is sente on the left.]
;W[eh]C[** White escapes, but he is still behind after giving up the top
left corner in the way he did.];B[no];W[mo];B[nn];W[kn];B[mn]
;W[ln];B[kj]LB[kp:A]C[** If at a white looks dead.];W[jp];B[kq]
;W[kp]LB[kk:A]C[** a now might be risky, as bad has bad aji at the
bottom.];B[lq]C[** Big since it secures all the territory at the bottom.]
;W[kk]C[**];B[cp];W[ar];B[cr];W[co];B[ei];W[ef];B[hc];W[gd]
;B[fb];W[gb];B[la];W[nb];B[nf]C[** Reduces white's liberties so that black will not have
to take them off the board.];W[ek];B[dm];W[em];B[ml];W[ll];B[nm]

corner later.];B[ns];W[ps];B[nq];W[mp];B[sj];W[sh];B[rr];W[rs]
