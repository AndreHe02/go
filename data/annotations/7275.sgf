C[DavidB here.  

Granted this was a fast game, but black needs to think primarily about defense.  one should ensure that a group is settled and safe before attacking or playing a big move.
Urgent moves come first at all times.  Help your weak groups, before playing elsewhere.

leaving behind weakness is the main problem for black in this game I think.  

secondly, perhaps becuase of the rapid pace of the game in part, black plays speculative moves that end up hurting black more than white.  Practice with reading is very important - even simple 2 step sequences should be readable and rejected as not playable.

hope this review is helpful.];B[pd]C[chro [10k\]: hi
