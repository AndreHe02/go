C[Hello reviewer whom I thank in advance for their time spent reviewing this.  When I was 7k, I played a lot of fast games to get my rank up, and wanted to play a serious game only later, and I got my chance here.  This is my first truly serious game in a long time, and I put a lot of effort into it.  The game has comments from other players, and Split reviewed a few things, though it didn't answer any of the questions I would have wanted answered.  Please review for both sides, since the game was very evenly matched and I can agree with almost everything the opponent played because of this.]
;B[qd]C[Comments by Az];W[dd];B[nc];W[dq];B[co];W[op]LB[ep:A]
[eq:B][fp:C][pp:D][ci:E]C[This seems a questionable move to me, since B can make the excellent followup moves at 'a', W 'b', B 'c', forcing white into a low position that doesn't work well with P4 (since P4 radiates influence primarily to the left). B could later extend around 'e' and get a comfortable position. White has a vast number of choices (too many to list), but if W wants to play in this corner instead of answering directly, 'd' might be a better move]
;B[gq]LB[ep:A]C[I think this move should be 'a', see prev. comment.

This is playable, but a weak black group on the bottom makes favorable use of P4 for W]
;W[ep];B[jq];W[dn];B[cf]LB[cm:A][cn:B]C[I am not so sure about the tenuki. If W plays 'b' W settles his group and builds some good thickness. Black normally plays 'a' immediately. If B is going to tenuki, he should make sure to come back to 'a' and not give up this stone. As long as B keeps the C5 stone white is a bit thin]
;W[fc];B[ci]LB[cm:A]C[Should be 'a' instead. 'a' would change the balance of power in the whole lower left of the board to favor black. C14 will have to fend for itself, this is more urgent.]
;W[pj]LB[cn:A]TR[gq][jq]C[W should have played 'a'. Both sides seem to miss the significance of a move in the corner. If W plays there first W is unconditionally alive and the G3/K3 group can be attacked. If B plays there first W is not unconditionally alive and may have to run - indirectly making G3/K3 safe]
;B[cm]LB[cn:A][bn:B][do:C][bm:D]C[I played c11 and c14 for this, hoping to take the corner after a degiri sequence, i really felt white gave me whole lot by not playing it.

Az: Better late than never, both sides should have played here a while ago. W 'a', B 'c', W 'c' is correct next (note that W would not play 'c' at 'd', since it would make B very thick and W would still be left with aji)]
;W[dm];B[cl];W[lq]TR[dm][dn][ep][dq]C[Good idea, but the W stones are too weak to be in attacking, if black moves out with his group, W may find himself under attack. Not playing C6 earlier and then D7 instead of C6 are the reason for W's present difficulty. Tough to find a good move for W at this point.]
;B[qp]LB[go:A][dl:B]C[B should defend first with 'a'. This not only makes the B stones stronger, but it also threatens W. After 'a' the threat of 'b' is big. Invading immediately will help W get thick and pressure the two B stones.]
;W[qo]LB[qq:A][pn:B]C[mitdahand [-\]: greetings fellow wingers. i c we've a league game here.

Az: This is a stange move. 'a' would be the most natural, since it takes profit while leaving B with some weak stones and making use of Q10. 'b' is the other common response, but here it would be too close to M3 and produce inefficent shape.]
;B[pp];W[po];B[oq];W[nq]LB[np:A]C[Correct move by W. B should atari before connecting, since it creates aji later on. Allowing W to connect without playing atari makes W thicker]
;B[pq];W[nr];B[oo];W[np];B[ro];W[rn]LB[rp:A][qn:B][or:C]C[neoKupo [6k\]: heh, i just noticed both of our pictures feature assault rifles :)

Az: B can connect at 'a' in sente, since B threatens 'b' next. So 'a' first, then 'c']
;B[or]C[Koosh [5k\]: oh!
Koosh [5k\]: haha];W[rp];B[rq];W[so];B[qr]LB[go:A]C[Koosh [5k\]: what is miza?  Is that spanish?
neoKupo [6k\]: mira

Az: We see now that the original invasion was a bad idea: B barely survived, picking up only 4-5 points of terroritory, while W is now extremely strong all around. W 'a' is the natural next move, since it pushes B towards thickness while defending the W stones. B could expect a difficult fight]
;W[ko]LB[go:A][on:B][qh:C]C[was it worth it to play the cut out [had it lived\]?

Az: First of all, 'a' is the important move to get the B group out of danger. This even threatens W a little bit, it's just the only move. Second, trying to extend the stone with 'b' serves no purpose. W is alive on the right and so thick he might as well be completely alive on the left, so what good does this do? It creates a target for W and allows W to get stronger by attacking. 'b' does nothing good for black at all. If you are concerned about the size of W's moyo, a move like 'c' is better, since it expands blacks area while threatening to reduce W more.]
;B[on]LB[mk:A]C[Koosh [5k\]: oh..."and you see"

Az: Since this move is so deep inside of W's area, W could try to attack on a larger scale with a move like 'a', though the move in game was playable. B is inviting so much trouble...]
;W[mm];B[ol]LB[nk:A]TR[qo][rn][so][rp]C[W 'a' next. B is far too afraid of W, W cannot kill or even seriously threaten the S4 stones. With 'a' W would capture the whole group]
;W[ql]C[Way to defensive for no reason, see prev. comment];B[nk]
;W[lk];B[qm]LB[rm:A]C[W should just answer at 'a', gives less forcing moves later]
;W[pl];B[qn];W[rm];B[pn];W[ro];B[oi];W[oj];B[nj];W[ni];B[mi]
;W[nh];B[oh]C[I read too quickly and missed the next play

Az: Lol... yeah, this gets a little tough for B ;)];W[mj];B[li]
;W[ng];B[ll];W[ml]
(;B[ff];W[kk]C[mitdahand [-\]: a bit of a disaster for black]
;B[fk]LB[go:A][gn:B]C[mitdahand [-\]: q12 overplayed
mitdahand [-\]: p12 that is

Az: Unless B has decided to give up on the two stones, B should play 'a', or maybe now even 'b' to try to extricate them. Playing a move like this invites W to play 'a', so if B is playing here he is saying "I give up on those stones". Otherwise don't help W attack them.]
;W[go];B[jo];W[kn]LB[jn:A]C[Hane at 'a' would be proper. W is thick, so the crosscut wouldn't help B]
;B[ho]C[Good move];W[gp];B[hp];W[fq]LB[hm:A]TR[jo]C['a' is the next move. W cannot cut because of the marked stone]
;B[gn]LB[hn:A]C[I felt this gave white a lot playing this out, but i couldn't see a good sabaki

Az: This way the cut at 'a' is potentially dangerous. See prev. comment]
;W[gr];B[hq];W[fn]LB[hn:A]C[This is a cowardly move. W should cut at 'a' and let B figure out how to save his group]
;B[fm];W[hn];B[gm];W[en];B[hr]C[i should have netted h6?

Az: Yes, J7 would have been good. Keeping all of your stones connected is very important, since it means they can't push you around.]
;W[dl];B[dk];W[in];B[fr];W[er];B[gs];W[ek]C[i didn't see d9......... ...

Az: See var for response]

LB[bd:A][cc:B][bc:C][bb:D][hc:E][db:F]C[A better way to attack might be B 'a', W 'b', B 'c', W 'd', B 'e'. W has to then play 'f' (or else B will play 'f' and W looses eyespace completely). So this would give you a big side and 'e' in sente]

(;B[mf]LB[hc:A]C[It is difficult to take any profit in this area no matter how B plays. This is why B should have taken 'a' in sente earlier]
;W[pg];B[ph];W[og]C[Split seems to think there is something profound about N9 and inflicts a huge number of variations on us to prove his point ;) There is nothing special or amazing, the stones stay dead, nothing changes.]

(;B[qh];W[nl];B[pe]C[Koosh [5k\]: ok];W[lh];B[ji]LB[kc:A]C[This doesn't do anything. W does not have to answer, since connecting poses no threat to W. 'a' would be much bigger]

;B[if];W[ce]C[See variation for a way to keep the corner and the center]

(;B[be]C[I played the corner invasion with knowledge that it'd mess up my middle territory...forgot to consider the loss of center territory..gotta beat that habit out of me..

;W[im];B[of]C[Az: Too early for this move. It is gote for W, and it has a very large sente threat, so it should be saved for a ko threat and played only later in yose. Since it is only worth 1 point, W won't play here first, it will still be waiting for B.

Split [-\]: and the variation
neoKupo [6k\]: do you still think b is better after that variation?

;W[nj];B[kr];W[lr];B[es];W[ds];B[ao];W[gf]LB[bq:A][cr:B][cq:C]
[dr:D][br:E]C[Lol, oh my. 'a' is the best followup for B in the corner. 'b' is inferior because W can play 'c' and then after the cut at 'd', W 'e', fixing things up for W. I think it goes without saying that W should not have made the tenuki, and not this move in particular, since it does not work and looses points. This was the loosing move, before this W still was leading.

I hope the review was helpful, sorry if I didn't go into all of the variations, but many of the moves were wrong on both sides, so the whole lines of play would need to be fixed to really "comment" on them.

Summary: W should have won this game. B made an ill fated invasion very early on, and then created a heavy group for no reason. Both sides made a number of other mistakes, but those were the two biggest mistakes by B I think. I hope the review helps, cheers.

B +2.5, I feel komi is really accurate ^^ go seems a more delicate game...in my experience of go I have found things now and then that seemed stepping stones, and I needed to work through them to get stronger.  is this the final one?  it seems like it is.  When I was weaker, I had a hard time understanding what pros did with those 10 hours, but now I feel I understand a lot more.  in your current experience, is there any higher stepping stone?  former stepping stones for me include things like super-large life and death problems, which I have gotten used to with experience.]
