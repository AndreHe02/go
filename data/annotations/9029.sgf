C[Hello and thanks for reviewing.

I have not made any further comments on my moves. I'm basically interested in my main mistakes. How did I loose the game? :)

Here is your faithful reviewer, jantje. I'll indicate comments with (j).
As to your question, I guess you played a bit too mild.];B[qd]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[pq];B[cj]LB[kc:a][oc:c][kd:b][po:e][qo:d]C[The points a b c d e are probably more urgent (j)]
;W[od];B[pf];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[kc]C[This choice of joseki may be just a little doubtful. Too comfortable for white in what should be black's sphere of influence. (j)]
;B[po];W[qm]C[Difficult to guess what W wants to achieve on the right side. (j)]
;B[on]C[I often play this move myself, but there's a risk of ending up with all influence and no points. (j)]
;W[qj]
(;B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[mq]C[This is joseki, but perhaps a bit hard to play for black. White has played on both sides, and B is not getting much in the corner. (j)]
;B[rr];W[pr];B[ol];W[ro];B[fq];W[hq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]TR[cj]C[Now the marked stone is in a not-urgent position. (J)]
;W[fc];B[df];W[cc];B[dc];W[db];B[cd];W[bb];B[bc];W[cb];B[oj]
C[I do not like this move much, the feeling is that B is playing neutral points. It's sente against W's group, but easily parried.
On the other hand, W's right side group is never going to make a lot of points and the B influence is steadily growing.  So I reserve my judgment until it becomes clear what B DOES with all his influence. (j)]
;W[qh];B[nf]C[Again B is making a threat that W can parry with thanks. Note that the B move makes no points, the W move does. (j)]
;W[md]LB[kq:a]C[Now it is high time for B to do something with all his influence. My move would be a, breaking up W and promising attack possibilities later.]
;B[fn]LB[fo:b][kq:c][fr:a]C[This has no connection to either of the marked stones, a or b or best of all c seem better. (j)]
;W[co]LB[cl:a]C[Wrong for several reasons:
1) loses a ko threat
2) takes w's own liberties
3) could be aji-keshi if a were an alternative (not now though)
(j)];B[bo];W[dn];B[cm];W[fp]C[W should push on. (j)];B[dm];W[em]
C[Now the marked stone is suddenly in a good position. This is an occasion for "cut first, think later". The fight must be OK for B since she has all this thickness. (j)]
;B[lo]C[Why did B not cut? And, again B is inviting W to please make some safe territory, losing the move at L3 forever.]
;W[kp]LB[kq:a]C[Later it becomes apparent that a is better (j)]
;B[kn];W[lf];B[nh];W[ch]C[An overplay.  (j)];B[di]C[OK! (j)]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[bd];B[be];W[ac];B[cf]LB[en:a]C[The last moves gave B some profit, but she is still behind (count and you'll see). The cut at a remains urgent (j)]
;W[lh];B[he];W[hc];B[lj];W[en]C[Finally W defends against the cut, putting an end to B's last chances. (j)]
;B[rb];W[qb]LB[qa:a][pb:b]C[Bad shape, good shape is a or b (j).]
;B[ql]C[A good idea! (j)];W[rl];B[rm];W[pl];B[qn];W[qk];B[rn]

C[Here the endgame starts. White wins withs 13,5 points (including 6,5 komi).

I hope for W's sake that he started on the right side, Q9 is still very big. 

In conclusion, 
- W played rather dubiously when he made a group on the right side. 
- But since you did not strongly attack that group, or made full use of the thickness you obtained, B ended up short of territory.
- The triangle marked stones gave W opportunity to consolidate his territory. Instead, you should have been looking to invade.
- Losing the fight with the circle marked stones was unfortunate, the most meaningful improvement would have been a instead of H13.
- I still do not understand why you did not cut at the cross sign.
- In the fighting in the lower right you showed talent!

Thanks for the opportunity to review your game,

(;B[pk]C[By the fact that W wants to attack the B corner, this becomes sente. It is a good thing to remember: a threat from the opponent will make anything that may remove the threat, sente --even if it was not so before. (j)]
