C[This is a really strange game.
We are both about same strength, I felt like winning big during the game, and to me it looks like I lost because of 1 great move of my opponent.

I would like to know about all possible mistakes I made during the game. Fuseki-Middlegame-Endgame.

Thank you very much in advance
Bram Vandenbon

Bram,

I reviewed your game and added my remarks. I hope they are of some help for you. For what it's worth, I am around 3d on KGS.

As you realized yourself, black was ahead in this game for a long time. The turning point was when white was able to capture several black stones on a pretty large scale. So although I agree that white was able to turn around the game by "1 great maneuver", it certainly was not just 1 great move - black missed several opportunities there wo limit the damage, and to still ensure victory. You should have been more self-confident with your correct assessment of being ahead, and thus should not have tried for too much at this point.

Kind regards,

;W[fd];B[mc]C[I tried to counter the influence of white here.

I did not play r5 to make my shimari at the bottum right, because a white approuch at q5 would probably be the wrong direction for white anyway.

ug: So far, everyting is all right. I would probably have played in the lower right instead of N17, either making a shimari, or an estension to N3, say, which also looks interesting. In any case, the difference between these choices certainly isn't big.

Currently, I think the game is promising for black. (I think that white should not have given black sente twice in the corner josekis. For example, he could have played J16 at H17 instead, and left the situation after black's C14, assuming that black had invaded the corner as in the game.)

Clearly, black has much more cash than white. The disdavantage of black's position is that his position on the left is very low, and white may gain further influence by pressing black down there. Black should try to neutralize white's influence in a careful way.]
;W[nq];B[po];W[no];B[ql]C[ug: This is quite a narrow extension. R10 would be more natural, I think.]
;W[qf];B[qd];W[qi]C[ug: Now (with R8 instead or R10) it is easy for white to split the black groups.]
;B[mp]C[Having read "Get Strong at Invading", this reminded me to one of the diagrams in there. Allthough after

ug: Black has to be careful here, with all the white influence. It might be preferable to first attack the two white stones on the right. In that way, black could establish a stronger position, and could then invade/reduce easier. (However, the final outcome of the following sequence is certainly allright for black, who reduces white's potential at the bottom and gets a fairly stable group oin the center.)]

(;B[kp];W[ln];B[iq]
(;W[jq];B[jp];W[kq];B[io];W[hp];B[ho];W[go];B[kn];W[lq]C[ug: Bad. Now black can settle himself easily.]
;B[lp]C[ug: Is this really sente? Splitting white in gote might not be good enough for black if white plays in the center...]

(;W[mq]C[ug: Black is lucky...];B[lm];W[mn];B[il]TR[ql][po]
[pq]C[Is my shape at the right too thin now ?

I feel like white could play r4 and r6 there.
So did I have to think about this before reducing white ? And when did I need to add a stone there ?

ug: It is clear that this whole sequence starting with the pincer at N4 has hurt the black corner. Still, black is ok for now, I think. With the narrow extension at R8, the corner group is in no danger. (This does not mean that black will get all the territory which these three stones claim right now.)

Black should try to strengthen his position in the lower right by attacking the two white stones above, as soon as he gets the chance.]

(;W[cl];B[cm];W[dl];B[ci]C[ug: Although it looks smaller, C13 instead is probably better shape and more efficient, since it also aims into the center. With C11, it will be easy for white to press black down to the side, and there is no sizeable amount of terrtory to expect at the right side, since black's position there was low from the start.]
;W[eg];B[kc]C[ug: This is an endgame move, although we still are in the middle game, i.e. there are still unsettled groups on the board. Black's groups are all pretty much stable, so there is no need to defend right now. Since white's R14/R11 group, on the other hand, is not stable at all, black should attack. P14 and P11 come to mind. Another possibility would be P8 which strengthens the lower right and prepares an attack on the white group.]
;W[ce]C[ug: Bad.];B[be];W[cg];B[bg];W[df];B[bf];W[ch];B[bh]
;W[di];B[dj];W[cj];B[bi];W[ei];B[ib]C[Dispite the weak situation at the bottum right, I did feel ahead here. See variation

ug: Another endgame move...

I basically agree with your count; black is ahead. However, the endgame moves at L17 and J18 allowed white to gain further influence, and black has to be careful to handle that. The risk with this influence is that (white) territory may appear in places where it cannot be expected right now - and this is exactly what will happen in this game.]

(;W[jc];B[jb];W[kd];B[ld]C[white he was creating some additional influence, i realized he would end in gote, and I would reduce the center]
;W[le];B[ji]C[... like this

ug: Good.];W[md];B[lc];W[nd];B[nc];W[od];B[oc];W[of]TR[ke][me]
[oe]C[I realized i could capture the 3 stones here. But thought it would be better just to use the aji to make some shape and cutting the 2 groups

ug: I agree that capturing these 3 stones is way to small right now. But separating the two groups here does not serve any purpose either, since both sides are quite strong by now. Note that by white's maneuver the group at the right side now has become reasonably strong.]
;B[ke];W[jd]
(;B[lf];W[me];B[kg];W[jf]C[Here i started to regret my choice, and realised i should probably have captured anyway

ug: It is good to sacrifice the one stone here! Although it is a cutting stone, it is not really important, since both sides are safe anyway. The relative strengths of the groups on the board have changed by now. Now, the white groups are all reasonably safe (even with the cut at L15), however, the black stones in the center are now almost surrounded by white walls, and although there should be now problem to establish a living group here, black obviously has to be careful.

So N12 shows the right attitude, but is, in my opinion, still too thin. It won't be a problem for black to sacrifice even all the three stones L15,M14, L13, as long as white cannot surround them on a large scale. Thus M11, or maybe even K9 look better to me, and should give a safe victory to black.]

(;B[mh];W[jk]C[Here everything starts going wrong :-s

ug: Indeed, now white succeeded to surround the upper black stones on a large scale.]
;B[ni]C[ug: O9 instead, in order to limit the damage, looks better. Afterwards black can try to reduce white's moyo a little, and then play P2, say, as a large endgame move which also secures the corner. (Note that, in the game, not only N12, L13 will be captured, but all the O10 stones, too!]

Strange that I lost this game, because i felt a lot stronger than my opponent. And have been leading most of the game (I think). And I am not aware of any big mistakes... ?

ug: If we compare this to your estimate at move 76, we see that the estimate was very accurate, except for one thing: in the game, white got a lot of territory in the center, an area which you left as neutral in your estimate. This is the territory white was able to cook up because of his influence (and several black mistakes). 

The game is still pretty close, so we see how much black was ahead before his mistakes in the center.]
