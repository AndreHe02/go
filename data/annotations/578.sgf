(;B[dc]LB[be:a]C[THe variation starting at 'a' looks more interesting to me as it keep the white group weak.  this should be blacks aim in this game because attacking these three stones would make us of all his stones..]
;W[bb];B[cb];W[bc];B[lj]LB[kl:a]C[MK: This looked like a winnig position to me. Is this not true or lost I too much in the endgame?
SGF Let's evaluate:
White: top right - 5 pts, right side 3 pts, bottom right 5pts with a 15 pt gote move available. lower left 15pts, upper left  12 pts Total - 40 pts minimum
Black top (asuuming W at D18 and later e19) 15pts, right15pts, bottom 10 pts, left nothing definite if white gets B10, total - minimum 40 points,   In absolute territoryy the game is very close. There is a big gote play at S5 but black will probably get it first.
 Are ther any weaker groups?  The 3 black stones on the left  don't have eyes yet but they have rooom for them.  THis is probably the only area where there is any middlegame left, although there is a cut at O10  The game will be decided by influence. as long as these 3 stones are safe.  Black has more influence so he should win.  Black should try to protect  O10 in sente and then play at B10. At all cost, W must not be allowed to play first on the left.
I would recommend a move at 'a'.  This indirectly protect the cut while reaching out to the left.  It also threatens to capture W50  and take a lot of territory in the center..  With this move black can afford to let White invade the left.]
;W[cl]C[MK: hard to counter. Probably I should not protect against the o10 cut with m10 and play c11 or so?
SGF  THe previous discussion shows that you ,must protect the cut in sente. This move was expected.]

(;B[dl]LB[bo:a]C[This makes it very easy on White in addition to letting White make enough territory to tip the balance in his favor.  I would consider 'a' first,although it is not ideal. (see variations)]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[cm];B[dm];W[bn];B[co];W[bo]C[White has gainsed about 10 points  and black has lost at east 5 by not playing B10 earlier.  this 15pt swings the game in white's favor.]
;B[ko]C[Too small.  This does not gain any territory and has little effect on white.   Black needs to find a way to convert the wall on the left into at least 15 points of territory while maintaining the overall balance.  This is not going to be easy.]
;W[ln]
(;B[go]LB[ep:a]C[Too simple.  Black must find some way to block in sente. See the variation at 'a']
;W[kn]C[This one move shows why playing to the left in sente is so important.]
;B[rp]C[big, but the center is now the main area.  This is worth close to 15pts but  if W ingnores it and plays in the center it will be very hard to win.]
;W[rq]C[Unnecessary. R3 is good enough.];B[qq];W[qp];B[rr];W[ro]

;W[im]C[This whole sequences is a disaster for black..  suddenly white has more potential in the middle than black.  B85 should have been at  73  Loosing a single stone at 45 would be small compared to completeing a second wall in the center.
Position Review. Black has gained 5 pts in the lower right, and 10 points in right center. W has gained 10 in the left and can get another 10 if he plays at C10.  THe balance of territory is still fairly even but now B has to take care of the group on the left and do so without giving anything to W.  The game is now harder for Black than after W60]
