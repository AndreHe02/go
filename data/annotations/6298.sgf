C[jepper: hi!
enteng: ok..enjoy the game
jepper: thanks. you too

DC: In summary, this was a good game, but there were several mistakes that caused Black to lose. They are written throughout the game, but generally:
1. The opening wasn't bad, except for misuse of some joseki that caused local losses.
2. In the middle game Black missed several oppurtunities to gain points, and made several mistakes. In my opinion the middle game needs more work than the opening.
3. The endgame was ok too, but being attentive and active during the endgame can be worth well over 10 points. There are no comments in the endgame. What you have to watch out for is always playing the biggest moves and the sente moves, which can let you play more than one endgame sequence in a row. Always look on the whole board carefully to find the best endgame moves.

When playing your next games, try to think of the consequences of playing certain moves. When considering which joseki to use, think about the different outcomes and compare them in your head. Whenever there's a free moment and you have sente, look on the whole board to see more or less who's ahead and where are the critical areas.]

(;B[qp]C[jepper: i started playing year and half ago also
enteng: in igs?
jepper: i wish i started when i was a kid!

DC: This 3-4 point is often considered to be inferior than Q3. The reason is that now when White approaches like in the game, the approaching stone is backed up by D4. If Black instead plays at Q3...(see variation)]

C[jepper: jepper
enteng: hmm..that move is not a big point
jepper: doh!
enteng: you should have taken the other corner

DC: R9 is indeed not the best move in the position. The Black position in the bottom right corner is solid, and playing too close to it is a waste of stones/strength(overconcentration). There's the proverb: "Play away from Thickness", and thickness means your own too, to maximize stone efficiency. Finally, at such an early stage in the opening, black really should take the advantage and grab the last open corner to get 3 corners.]
;W[dc]C[jepper: ahh i c];B[de]C[enteng: and you're over concentrated on the right side]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd]C[jepper: mmm]
(;B[dh]C[DC: This move is a light move, which would fit only when Black does not have room on the left side to make life, such as having a White stone at C11 which limits Black's space. In such a position the normal move at D14 will make black heavy and easy to attack so this move would be good.

Right now, though, the left side is open enough for Black to make life just like in the joseki(i.e. B D12 at D14, W F17, B D10). Compare the position at move 20 in the game and in the variation.]
;W[fd];B[ee];W[nc];B[oc]C[DC: This joseki fits cases where there is a black stone at K16 or K17(typically high-handi games, but not only), which threatens O17. Then, the purpose of this move is to make white extend to O16 and become heavier(when you have two connected stones it costs more to sacrifice them, and playing near them more will make them bigger and less flexible).The variation shows a good use of this move in a similar position.

Finally, this move is not so good in this position beacuse white has the top left, so it gives White a better grip on the top, especially that now White can extend to as far as K17 which suits F16 too. A better move would be Q14 to start with.]

(;W[nd];B[pf]C[enteng: bad choice of joseki imo];W[jc]C[jepper: oh hehe
jepper: i recently learned it so i've been using it like this a lot]
;B[cn]C[DC: This move would have been much better if it continued from the variation on move 17(compare). I am not mentioning this to make you feel bad, just to show the accumulating effects of the D15 sequence :).]
;W[en];B[dm]C[DC: Black D8 is more usual here. Often playing a keima(knight's move) after being capped(E6) is good. This position occurs frequently on the sides as well, just without D4. A keima does not allow white to push in sente and leaves less weaknesses in Black's position, as well as leaving him less stretched(like D7-D12 relation).]
;W[em];B[bp]C[DC: There's a proverb: "Hane at the head". It means that in a position similar to D7-E7, it is a great advantage to be the first to play hane. B4 is really not urgent now, because the Black territory is affected by E7. Also it should be mentioned that invading may be possible which makes this aji-keshi(removal of oppurtunities). Because of the C6-D7 shape, which is not optimal, it may be preferable to extend once to D8 or D9 before playing hane.

If White gets to play the hane(or other moves that take advantage of the weakness), Black's territory will be pressed unto the side and become smaller, while the White area in the centre will become bigger. If Black gets to push White towards the centre, Black's side will become bigger and White's centre smaller.]

TR[jk][jl][jm]C[enteng: hmm..see my framework?
jepper: yes

DC: This is not a small point but should be left for later on in the game. This is a move that should be played as soon as possible once the middle game ends, but it didn't yet.

Let's make a rough count of the board(counting only sure territory):

Black:
UR - 18 points, BR - 20 points, R - 20 points, Total: 58

White:
U - 26 points(after b P18), B - 38 points, Total: 64

This puts White 6 points ahead in solid territory. As to potential territory, Black can earn a few more points on the right side, and White has a lot to gain in the centre. Any one of the triangled points reduces the White area and is hard for White to capture(Black has allies all along the right side and D12 and E15 on the left, plus the cut at E8).]
;W[nm]C[enteng: it's going to get bigger
jepper: noooo
jepper: lol];B[jf]C[DC: This point is dame, meaning it's not likely any side can have territory here. Good alternatives are P9 and O9, which enlarge the right side(with a good followup at O14), or K10 and K9, since a reduction is still possible.]

(;B[qf]C[DC: No reason not to cut White.];W[pg]
(;B[nk]C[DC: This can be cut very easily. A similar but better move is P8, since it cannot be cut easily, or maybe trying to play close to the open edge of White's area.

Other than this, there are other possible moves displayed in the variations.]
;W[pk];B[ol];W[pl];B[ql];W[om];B[pm];W[ni];B[ji]C[DC: It's better to play this immediately without the O9 sequence.
