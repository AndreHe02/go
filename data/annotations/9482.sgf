AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, I'm Roma (cassum).
That was a very hard game for me, I tried to play a bit aggressivly to be capabale to deal with handi, but i was not the only who tried to fight. And battle statrs from the very beginning.

Main questions are:
1) What direction mistakes I made here?
2) Any tips about how to play with handi without unnecessary agression (and is there such a way)?
3) Also I would be very glad to see any tesujies that I missed in this game.

Thank you =)

Hi Roma,
A fun game to review. Thank you.

Overall I think you got impatient and left your groups weak in an attempt to gain early territory.
You need to have more faith that a weaker player will make a mistake that you, with better understanding of positional play, will be able to capitalize on.
Or, they won't and they will win. Either way it's not good to live in fear.

Check out:
Move 7 for an alternative joseki.
Move 17 left the G-line stones weak for a long time.
I thought the 3-3 invasions at C3 and R3 both resulted in black getting more than you did.
Move 51 was very good but move 53 was too much of a reach.

Paul];W[cd];B[pp];W[cn];B[fq];W[dj];B[ed]C[(cassum) Here the problems starts. Maybe it would be better to play gently here (like in variants)?]

(;W[qk]LB[qj:A]TR[qn]C[(cassum) Yes, I did know that was too far, but this is still handi game and this meve has a good extention in r6

At this point I would think the game might be decidied by what happens on the top side. Playing at A makes your group much more strong so it cannot be pushed around in the fighting.]

(;B[nd]
(;W[mg]TR[qe][qf][qg][nh][oh][ph][ni][qi]C[I feel this is an overplay. The white triangle stones are dead meaning the the black triangle group is alive. So your move just creates another four stone target group which is a liability at this time.]

(;W[cq]C[(cassum) Here I'm statrted to loose game's flow and didn't find any good moves and I desided to get some points.

Black doesn't really have corner territory without another move here and if he comes down at C4 you might loose what you have on the left side. I would be much more concerned about the potential of the center bottom.]

I wouldn't try if I couldn't read it out completely. If your center group dies that is it. Black would get four stones in gote but I think you have to be thinking about making eye shape or running.]

(;W[lf];B[kf];W[lh];B[kh]C[The reading here is very complicated. You are both holding hands and jumping off the cliff hoping to be the one to land on top.]
