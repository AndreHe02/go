ndkrempel [9k\]: enjoy!];B[pd];W[dp]C[Kartoffel [8k\]: You too.]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]TR[qk]C[karma : an alternative of F3 is the chinese opening at R9.]
;W[iq];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[co]C[I think this should be at C4 (or B5..?), as white can push through and cut.... Oops

karma: yes, white can use your mistake later in the game];W[cp]

;B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]C[Is this right vs B14?

karma : C14 is the usual joseki, you don't need to go in B14 ... but every thing depend of the context.

The usual idea of C14 is to extend to D14 and push white while making a wall for the left side. But since white is already on the left side, it won't work.]
;W[dg]C[Should I respond here? Or tenuki like I did?

karma: if it was me, I would probably tenuki.D13 is not big enough.]
;B[qk]C[Up until now I usually stuck to hoshi, so this is experimental and new for me! But fun :)

karma: good move here.];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[qo];B[np]
C[Some ad hoc joseki-age, this prob has lots of flaws (but white also?)]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[rq];B[rr];W[mr];B[rp];W[or];B[pr]TR[lp]C[karma: IMHO, this move is too little. You should be able to sacrifice a few stones and win a great influence by playing around M4.]

(;B[pp]C[karma: This move is too defensive. You gave white a great wall.]

If I don't make D7 mistake, is the cut valid? Good idea?];W[cn]

C[This reduction too deep? How best to limit the emerging white moyo?

karma: here, you choosed the harder side.
The bottom side was mre easy to reduce first, because there is some stones to connect to when you need to escape if you have problems with life.

Also, you could play a peaceful move at O13 .. it reduce the white territoty, and increase your.

L15 only gave a target to white.];W[kg];B[hf];W[gd];B[ng]C[karma: good move]

With M8, white is very little, and he need to take care to not been cut.]

C[Kartoffel [8k\]: Now this is a fight to my tastes. No such thing as too much complexity.
ndkrempel [9k\]: heheh];B[el];W[fm];B[fl];W[hl];B[gm]C[white should let me have F7 and take J7 in exchange here? Then my centre stones still in trouble?
Seems to be hard to rescue them, any suggetsions?

karma: yes, he should play H7 .. white wanted too much.];W[dl]

(;B[fp]C[karma: This seems more coherent .. then you have only 1 invading group to take care. Note also that you split the groups of white .. he will need to have life in both later.]
