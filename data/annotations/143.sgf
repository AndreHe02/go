[dl][ck][cj]C[Dieter: I  played a. However, b or c are better, since they attack the stone at C5 and  at the same time they are an extension from the upper left corner. c is the  better extension, b is a more serious attack.
Is this correct?

Rob- Well, I would tend to agree. I might actually
play d..but c is probably better. I must say though
that in no way is 'a' a mistake];B[cp]L[dl];W[do];B[qn]L[cj]C[Rob - *Now*, instead of 9, I would definitely  a..]
;W[pn];B[qo]L[pm][qp][qq]C[Rob- This move is a mistake, because it is a 1/2  measure.
Either a or b is right, or if you really want the corner, c.];W[qp];B[rp]
L[pm]C[Dieter: Would it be better to get  to a?

Rob- Yes clearly. That transposes back to the attach and extend joseki.]
;W[rq];B[qf]L[qi][qm]C[Rob -15 leaves the lower left too weak. you may
get away with this against  this player, but not
against better players. I applaud the idea of getting
sente, but a or b could get quite unpleasant for you.];W[pf];B[pg];W[of]
;B[og];W[qe];B[rf];W[qm]
(;B[rm]L[pm]C[Dieter: To get  territory on the side, I have to give up the stone at S4, because I failed to   play at a.

Rob- I don't think you can play a here. This is very
nasty for you, and is only redeemed when white
plays a very poor move at s5. See variation 1 for
what happens if you a.];W[ql];B[rl];W[ro]C[Rob- This is awful. w should just  r9, and let you crawl
on the 2nd line.];B[rn];W[sp];B[qk];W[pk];B[qj];W[pj];B[pi];W[re]C[Dieter:  White got both corners on the right, but Black is living. W has more defects.

Rob- Yes, though w also has some thickness,  though it does have defects, as  you note.]
;B[po];W[oo];B[pm];W[om];B[pl];W[ol];B[on];W[nn]C[Rob- w just  horrible here..b takes advantage well.]
;B[cj];W[bp];B[bq];W[dp];B[cq]C[Dieter: Now I have to move to C10 and  got a bad shape in the lower left  corner. C9 as answer C5 would have been better.

Rob- I'm not sure I understand your comment. You  have a great result here. Your corner is small, but alive, and you have large  potential above c10..]
;W[bn]L[eq][cl]C[Rob- w b6 just awful. It must be a or b. b6  does nothing good for w..]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[fp];W[fo]
(;B[ok]L[gp]C[Rob  - p9 is not right. If there is a rule that is close to absolute in go, it is  - If an opponent wants to push you on the 4th line, let him. You are getting  enormous territory, and w's thickness is not as useful as it could be because  of c10..P9 MUST be a. Variation 1 is what you look like with a.]

(;W[oj]C[Rob- This variation 1  is what you look like if w takes a.];B[nk]
;W[nl];B[nj];W[oi];B[ni]C[Rob- You took advantage of w's weak play very well.   Still, p9 was wrong now.]

L[gp][ej]C[Rob - This is not bad for you, but I think a is  still the biggest move around. b is second biggest..]
;W[lc]L[oc][hp][ie][lh][gp][ej]C[Dieter: A mistake?
I would try to hold the corner (with a) or get somewhere else territory (b, c  or d). Right?

Rob- Well, I don't fault w for this attack. However,
a wouldn't be bad. b would be atrocious for w, and I see very little point in  c or d..

If I was w, I'd a, e, or f  right now.. Or maybe resign :)];B[lb];W[mc]

;B[pc]C[Dieter: Now I got the corner.];W[oc];B[nb];W[pb]L[qc]C[Rob- Some more bad  fighting by w..q18 the crowning bad move..a is better..]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[qb];W[od];B[ie];W[gp]C[Rob- Finally, a good move by w..]
;B[gq];W[hp]L[hq]C[Rob- I think h4 should be a.];B[hq];W[iq];B[ir];W
[jq];B[ln];W[lo];B[mo];W[no];B[ko];W[lp];B[km]C[Rob- I know you are killing this guy, but  look at the difference if you g4 rather than him g4.]
;W[gn];B[ip];W[io];B[jp];W[kp];B[jo]C[Rob - w awful here :(];W[in];B[kq]
;W[lq];B[jr];W[kr];B[il];W[gl];B[fj]C[Rob- Excellent];W[fk]L[gh][ch]
C[Rob - W plays right into your hands with the  contact at f9. I might try a or maybe b, since things are so desperate.  Really no chance for w..]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[dk];W[dl];B[el];W[fl];B[cl];W[dm];B[hj];W[gj];B[gi];W[gk]
;B[fh]C[Rob - Solid play by b.];W[hk];B[ij];W[ik]C[Rob - W assists b in building more territory..]

(;B[lh]L[lg]C[Dieter: Better at a?

Rob- a is the shape.];W[mh];B[mg]C[
 jz 23k : i guess i'll resign, good game :)];C[Rob- Final Comments- well, you really pounded w here. It was  difficult to find much wrong, except for not doing g4. Realize that as you  play better players, you won't be able to push them around in the fights like  you did here. My best advice would be : Play better players! :)]
