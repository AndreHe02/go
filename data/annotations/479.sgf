C[Hi,
 Both players played well.  Black seemed to have the upper hand after the oppening.  Black made an invasion late in the game that was too deep and white was able to capitalize on it.

Hope my review is usefull];B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[cq];B[ep];W[co]
LB[do:a][eo:b][dn:c][dq:d][cr:e][en:f][dm:g]C[White C5 seem a little low. I think White has a right to claim more at 'a' (then Black b, White c ...). This is fine however, it creates completed shape which can be left to play elsewhere]
;B[dn]LB[cn:a]C[
Next black 'a' will be huge];W[oq];B[ec]LB[qj:a][pj:b]C[After White's corner enclosure, Black 'a' or 'b' is also a big move to prevent white extending]
;W[qj]C[White's extension is very big.];B[qh]LB[oj:a]C[This will merely induce white to play 'a' which expands white's moyo faster than black's could.]
;W[cj];B[ch];W[cm];B[cn];W[bn];B[dm];W[cl];B[dl]LB[dq:a]C[White need not respond to this. maybe 'a' instea
d];W[jq]LB[jo:a][oj:b]C[Good. White's double wing formation is strong and would like to play 'a' or 'b' in the futre]
;B[oo]LB[rp:a]C[This is good. A probe at 'a' is another method but very complicated]
;W[qm];B[nq];W[np]TR[db]LB[pq:a]C[This move makes things ki
nd of complicated, would be simpler at 'a'];B[op];W[mp];B[pq]
;W[nr]LB[or:a]C[You can save the stone but its not necessarily a good idea]
;B[or];W[mq];B[oq];W[mr]TR[jq]C[Now white's marked stone seem too close to his wall,]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[pn];W[qn];B[po];W[qq];B[nm];W[gq]LB[nk:a][lm:b]
C[Black has reduced white and his group is out into the center.  Also white's 2 groups are worth about 30 pts.  White had much more potential before black invaded.   White should attack black's group from both sides to build thickness for use elsewhere.  'a' seems lik a good start]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[dq]LB[jc:a][jd:b]C[These last two black moves reduce white's territory a little but a move around 'a' or 'b' is MUCH bigger]
;W[mc];B[oc];W[jc];B[hc];W[mn]TR[mc][jc]LB[oj:a][nk:b]C[Better to attack from th other side with 'a' or 'b', white needs influence to help  marked stones]
;B[oi];W[gn];B[dk];W[dj]C[I guess white eventually realized this left him too thin.]
;B[ck];W[bk];B[bj];W[al]LB[bl:a]C[White should play at 'a' at this point]

;B[qb];W[nc];B[rc]LB[bh:a][mm:b]C[You don need to take this stone. Its dead play 'a'  to seal of your territory or 'b' to reduce whites]
;W[me];B[nf]LB[bh:a][mm:b][hl:c][jm:d]C[I think 'a' is much bigger.  Big moves right now should
 concentrate on black reducing or white enlarge the white moyo in the bottom center.  White could play around 'b' and 'c' .
Black could think about 'b' , 'd' or some such move.];W[bg]
;B[bh];W[ah];B[bf]LB[cg:a]C[Black better off playing at 'a' and cutting his losses (which are small)]
;W[cg];B[eh];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[de];W[ff];B[fe];W[gg];B[io]
