Fredtor: This is my first game at Cyberkiwon and also the first one I request for rewiew.The Cyberkiwon gave me a rank of 15k (as beginner) that I know is not real, I am registered at WWGO as 26 k, which is closer to reality.
I need to have my mistakes appointed by some one stronger than me, as the only way I have to learn Go is though the Internet, there are no Clubs, nor books where I live north of Brazil.  Thks in advance.


Hi,

I will try to enlighten this game for you. As a synthesis, you lost because :
1) your shapes in the beginning are loose, ad W could exploit this.  2) You let W cut you (twice) where you should have build strongly

With this as a start, and some quick reading of a couple of basic josekis (just reading the first 3 moves, for shape), I think you can make some usefull progress. The rest is ... playing, and getting games reviewed.

Hope this helped];B[pd]C[Fredtor: Normal start 4-4 point seeking more influence toward the center than making territory in the corner (I learned in the Sensey Library, thanks for them). But due to several mistake, I could' t get the center.

Sensei is a good place to start :-)];W[pp];B[dp];W[dc];B[di]
TR[ce][de]C[D11 is not really Joseki
Rather aim at W corner];W[fq];B[qi]TR[qf][qj]C[I you decide to tenuki (ignore) F3, then you should either go to R10, or strengthen your corner]
;W[cf]C[This W shape is loose and can be endangered by average player
Normal follow up would be W C6];B[jc]C[Basically here, you did not build any strenght (but neither did W). Your stones are spread across the board ...]
;W[cm]
(;B[ck]C[this will give corner. see variations];W[cq]C[Fredtor: Normal 3-3 invasion, but I didn' t react properly and lost the line started at D4

No, at this stage, the corner is lost anyway, and D4 is very weak ...]

(;B[cg]TR[nq]C[This does not bring very much  ... influence on upper W group is weak.  only result is W strenghthening ... (don't attach to a stone you attack
O3 was better];W[dg];B[ch];W[ef];B[bl]C[very small again];W[cp]
;B[do];W[co];B[dl];W[dq]
(;B[dn]C[see variation];W[dm];B[em];W[cn];B[qm]C[Carefull !]
;W[en]C[Fredtor: I was not expecting the W E6 so soon.

That was obvious ... urgent points before big points
1) protect your weaknesses
2) attack opponent weaknesses
3) play big points

This is the first W cut referred to in the beginning];B[el]
;W[fn];B[mo]C[Wow, what was the purpose of this ?
Again, O3 was more efficient ... W can cut with P6 or Q6];W[mq]
;B[bf];W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[ag]C[no necessary. W can't harm]
;W[hc];B[md];W[qc]C[Fredtor: Starting 3-3 invasion joseki];B[qd]
C[yes, good size choice];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[sd]C[Fredtor: Should have been R14, I was lucky, my opponent didn' t start eating me up.

Yes, joseki is R14];W[sc];B[qf];W[qn]C[Now look at the board : W got upper left, bottom left, bottom right is not invadable by B
In compensation, B has very strong center influence, but it will be difficult to balance W advance on the board edges.]
;B[oo]C[OK, building moyo];W[po];B[pn]TR[on]C[no, don't attach like this.    p5 was stronger]
;W[pm];B[om]C[Fredtor: I really don' t know what I expected with this move.

Neither do I :-)];W[on];B[pl];W[pn];B[ql]C[I would have chosen P8 to avoid the cut into the centre ...]
;W[ol];B[nm]C[second W cut ... very severe because 07 group will be weak soon]
;W[nl];B[nn];W[op];B[no]TR[ml]C[you should have let P5, and play N8 to run ahead of White. Now, he will be ahead]
;W[ml]C[Fredtor: Here we started a run that I didn' t know how to block, defend or attack, I just follow.]
;B[mm];W[ll];B[lm];W[kl];B[km];W[jl];B[jm];W[il];B[im];W[hl]
;B[hm];W[gl];B[gm];W[fm]C[Fredtor: I knowed he was not going to allow me to connect, and couldn' t avoid it.

but you need to find life on the bottom side, and then, your centre is ruined ...
At this stage, game is done already]
(;B[fl];W[hh]C[Fredtor: With this White thickness on line 8, I realize that dominate the center will be very hard.]
;B[lp];W[lq];B[mp]C[not needed];W[kq]C[Fredtor: Starting a run again.]
;B[jp]C[Fredtor: Trying something different.];W[jq];B[ip];W[iq]
C[Fredtor: He didn't bother at all.];B[hp];W[hq];B[gp];W[fp]
;B[fo]C[Fredtor: This move F5 dosn' t make sense.];W[go];B[gn]
;W[eo];B[ho];W[fo];B[kp];W[np];B[gq];W[gr]C[Fredtor: This final shape seems to be all wrong. White now is strong in the center, the lower right, bottom center and lower left. I think I gave him the game.

Basically : yes];B[fr]C[Fredtor: Trying to fuss.];W[hr];B[eq]
;W[ep]C[Fredtor: Rewiewing my own game now, I realise that maybe I could have played at D5. Maybe a strong player could destroy the shape of white in this corner. Any variation possible??

No, no chance. Even if you play D5, W E2 makes life.];B[ok]
;W[nk];B[pj]TR[oj]C[P10 is bigger];W[oj];B[nj];W[oi];B[ni];W[oh]
;B[og];W[nh];B[mh];W[mi];B[li];W[mj]C[Fredtor: Am I stupid?

Sometimes happen, when you have been through difficulties, you (happens to me as well) lose common sense ..

The rest is endgame. No further comment until end game.];B[lh]
;W[ng];B[pg];W[ne];B[oe];W[me];B[nd];W[le];B[ld];W[ke];B[kd]
;W[je];B[jd];W[ie]C[Fredtor: I am still strengening white in the center.]
;B[id];W[hd];B[ic];W[hb];B[ib];W[ei];B[dj];W[ej];B[ek];W[fk]
;B[cl];W[gj];B[ae];W[ad];B[nf];W[mf];B[mg]C[Fredtor: N13 silly move.]
;W[of];B[pf];W[nf];B[ph];W[pi];B[qk]C[Fredtor:  I preferred to loose one stone than to risk my small territory.]
;W[pk];B[qj];W[rm];B[rl];W[rn];B[sm];W[sn];B[sl];W[ia];B[ja]
;W[ha];B[se];W[pa];B[na];W[oa];B[ma];W[qb];B[kb];W[bm];B[rg]
;W[al];B[ak];W[am];B[bj]C[Fredtor: The moves L18, S13 and B10 were useless I should have tried a 3-3 invasion at R3 or better a 3-4. Any possible variation ?]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[qq];B[ln]C[Fredtor: And this was The End. Could you show me if from this point there was still some game possibility ?

Thank you

I think frankly that you were right not trying anything. I don't see any possibilities.]
