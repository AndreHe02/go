C[Dear Reviewer,

My name is uncas (Last of the Mohecians).  I felt confident throughout
most of this game - really confident - but managed to lose by about 10-15
points.  Your comments will be much appreciated.

;W[of];B[rd]C[this is irregular. if now W plays at O16, which is the direction of the natural development of your star-point, and you connect underneath (which seems to be the aim of S16) , then :
W gets a high position facing his star-point, and B gets a low position facing his shimari, allowing W to press with R13 etc. the territory B gets is not enough compensation.]
;W[re]C[feels too tight, W should play O16.
notice how, on a large scale point of view, W O16 creates cooperation between the W stones.]
;B[qd]C[definitely too cramped. it's not endgame yet :)];W[pi]
;B[fq];W[dm];B[jp];W[dg]C[already I prefer W's position, although nothing is settled yet of course. after D13 especially, the cry rising from o16 is deafening.]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[cc]C[as always, the question is from where to block. C16 (after D17) seems to me correct because of the high position of D13 and the prospects to attack D10, although there is no severe way to do it now as it's 2 spaces away from enemy stones. also, the P14 - Q16 formation limits the potential of the upper side, which is the direction of development of a vertical wall around D16. So better go for a horizontal wall.]

;W[cg];B[mc]C[good result for B as he got to play in the vital area. the third line is correct now because of the W wall.]
;W[lq];B[jq];W[lo];B[dr];W[cq];B[lm]C[too ambitious, W has big holes to break through. better make sabaki for D10 stone, endangered now that W got the wall and after c3 stabilized the corner.]
;W[mm]C[this helps B benefit from his cap. better just play L6 and get out while giving B as little thickness as possible. P5 also a nice point.]
;B[mn];W[ln];B[nn];W[jn];B[ll];W[nl];B[ol]C[regarding the right side, W should have avoided thid result as next S8 is very big. but W is accumulating strength in the center, and B must be very careful. D10 has not even beginning of shape, and M7 stones cannot be sacrificed as they are cutting stones (pivotal). next B K8 - W H6 - B L11 is reasonable for B, then maybe C7 probe. so B has some tough sabaki maneouvers ahead, and if successful will come out a little ahead.
I'd take W's position here though.];W[nk];B[jl];W[hn];B[hl]
C[this is asking for a splitting attack. when 2 escaping groups are 3-4 spaces away, a splitting move is most severe. better play L11 and leave D10 some room.]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[gp];B[gq];W[fj]C[B in deep trouble.];B[fl];W[ek]
;B[io];W[in];B[fm];W[gm]C[needlessly strengthening B.
Do not touch.... :)

F4 is much better. if B pushes through at H5, these 3 stones can be sacrificed.]
;B[gl];W[fn];B[en]C[now W is under pressure too. I don't see a way to stop B from breaking through W's position.]

;W[bk];B[cl];W[ck];B[dl]C[great result for B. but W has still a good position. K9 peep, then maybe L16 gives him a big moyo.

first has to make his lower side alive.];W[np];B[op];W[mo];B[pn]
;W[ik];B[il];W[ii];B[ig]C[too deep ! W very strong all around.]
;W[kc]C[has to be on the fourth line, aiming to attack J13.]
;B[lg]C[W should lean at N16, then cut the 2-space extension at L13.]
;W[ki];B[og];W[pg];B[nf];W[oe];B[nd];W[ne];B[me];W[mf];B[lf]
;W[ng];B[ld]C[nice play by B.];W[rm]C[time for counting on entering the endgame :
W has 50 solid points, and potential around F15 that is worth about 8 points, more if he plays there first. also has N12.
B has 50 solid points too, but little scope for more.   so after komi, W leads quite securely, expected to win by over 10 pts.]
;B[rn]C[answering here is bad. S7 is big, so B should look for big points for himself too. J16 kikashi then G13 for example.
endgame is controlled by the principle of mutual destruction. if both sides start with identical positions ( like in Mirror-Go),
then one side answers all the other's "sente" moves, he falls behind.]
;W[qm];B[qn];W[hf]C[W is winning.];B[hg];W[gf];B[nh];W[oh];B[kd]
;W[jd];B[gg];W[fg];B[gi];W[fi];B[mj];W[nj];B[ni]C[notice B is spending moves to erase various W potentials, but not making any points for himself.
a move like S7 both takes points and prevents them from the enemy.]
;W[gj];B[hi];W[hj];B[ff];W[fh];B[if];W[ie];B[jc];W[jf];B[he]
;W[ge];B[ic];W[hd];B[jg];W[om]C[not good. L18 huge.];B[pm];W[pl]

;B[rj];W[ri];B[rk];W[rh];B[se];W[sf];B[sd];W[ib]C[L18 :)

on most stages of the game, I think W had a better position. perhaps you should pay more attention to the benefits of central power.W could attack M8 much more severely. also in endgame , you have to spend move around opponent's walls to prevent him from picking up points.
