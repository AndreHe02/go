C[Fua [12k\]: Hello!];B[pd];W[dd]C[elgato4431 [12k\]: hi gg]
;B[pq];W[co];B[fp]CR[ep][dq][eq]C[P - This seems too soft.  Consider the circled points as an alternative.  White played too far from the corner - this is a mistake you could have punished.]
;W[dq];B[eq]CR[fc][nc][jd][cf][df][qf][ci][di][dj][pj][qj][pn]
[qn][po][qo][jp][kp][kq][lq]SQ[fq][fr]C[P-  This move is premature.  You don't want to initiate contact with White's stones this early on.  Remember - attachment strengthens both stones, white and black.  There are plenty of moves on the board that are more urgent than this, see the circled points.  Forgetting the whole board for a minute, if you wanted to block off white from advancing along the bottom, consider the squared points.]
;W[qo];B[np];W[qq]CR[jp][jq]C[Fua: I was trying to the bottom half this way. In the end, it worked. But, he reduced my terittory by a lot.

P- if you consider your shape at the bottom, you have some major problems making points in this way.  For starters, you're squeezed against two corners that are far enough "ahead" in front of your stones in the north-south direction that you are going to have a hard time avoiding getting confined to the small area you've sketched out.  Also, there is a huge threat of invasion at the circled points.  All this together means White has a lot of opprotunities to take sente.]
;B[pk]CR[jc][nc][jd][qf][ci][di][dj][jp][jq]C[P-  I don't think this move was considered very carefully.  You've created a very weak position on the board with this move.  Try to make your weakest group stronger and your opponents weakest group weaker with the same move.  By playing Q9 you've created both a new weak group and an opprotunity for white to cut your groups apart.  More urgent points are circled.]
;W[oq]
(;B[nq]C[P- You are too dead-set on holding on to that bottom area.  You think you have sketched it out as "yours" but in reality you do not currently have any territory on the board at this time.  Consider this variation:]
;W[pp];B[or];W[pr];B[nr];W[qf]TR[nr]C[P- You see here what I mean about giving up sente too easily.  White is leading you around the board, focusing your play in areas that are to White's advantage.  By the end of the game, your move at O2 is worth much, much less than White's move at R14]
;B[qh]TR[qi][qj][np][nq][nr][or]C[Is this a bad move? Should I have tried to connect with the triangled group?

P-  Your goal is to make territory and reduce the space White has to make territory in.  This move doesn't really accomplish those things.  If reducing the space the white stone at R14 has to live is the most urgent matter (which it isn't) I would have suggested the marked points.  You need to carefully consider how many points are made from you and denied the enemy with each move.]
;W[of]C[P- See, White's goal here is for the group that just extended to live.  As long as that group lives, the area you can control is severely limited.  White's group has a lot of different options for directions to run.  This should have been considered before putting pressure on the stone with R12]
(;B[nd]C[P-Too timid, you could have gotten away with a two or three space extention here.  See variations.]
;W[fc];B[jd]C[P- Too many stones on the fourth line, you're practically begging White to slip in underneath your stone at K16]
;W[cf]C[P-White's move here is very strong, you could have made this pattern in either of your corners if you had played higher urgency moves eariler.]
;B[dm];W[cm];B[cl]C[P-  When you make a hane like this you could have already considered whites possible responses.  Whoever extends first from a hane like this has the upper hand.  Instead you played a series of loose diagonals.  See variation.]
;W[dn]
(;B[bm];W[cn];B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[cj];B[di];W[ch];B[ci];W[bi]
;B[dh];W[cg];B[bk]C[P-  This is a low urgency move, save plays like this for mid/end game.]
;W[bj]LB[qm:A][oo:B]C[Fua [12k\]: Thank you.]
(;B[qm];W[qi];B[pi];W[ph];B[qj];W[ri]C[P- note that White now has the advantage, having extended first.]
;B[rh];W[oi];B[pj];W[qg];B[si];W[rg];B[rj];W[nh];B[dp];W[cp]
;B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[eo]TR[en]C[Should I have played at the triangled space instead? In the end, I think the reason why I lost so much territory is because he pushed through here.

P - Again, you didn't "lose" territory, you failed to create it in the first place.  The point you marked has some possibilities, but White can still break through.  See vars.]
;W[en];B[fn];W[em];B[kf]CR[hc][mf][jp][jq][cr]C[Is this move bad? I was trying to extend into the middle, but he invaded right away

P-It's bad in that it's premature.  Consider how many points you made with this move.  Zero.  The circled points are more urgent.]
;W[ld]
(;B[mc]C[P- I think you should read up a bit into what to do about invasion of three-point extention.]

Fua: Was there any major mistakes that I made? What can I do to improve? Thank you.

P- I suggest studying some more, the Elementary Go Series addresses a lot of the major flaws in this game.  If you practice checking a couple of things before placing each stone, you'll make it to SDK in no time.  Each time you move:

*Evaluate how much territory the move creates from you and takes away from your opponent

*Identify your strongest and weakest groups and those of your enemies.  You should be strengthening your weakest group and weakening the enemy's weakest group with each turn

*Study some simple joseki patterns.  Don't bother memorizing them, but consider how the patterns A) usually result in an even result for both sides and B) are rife with opprotunities to punish a greedy opponent

*Identify the most urgent move EACH TURN.  Ask yourself "If I were my opponent and I got a free move right now, what move would damage my opponent the most?".  If you -really- don't want to see a White stone there, put a Black stone there first.

*Don't count your chickens before they're hatched.  Your loose impression of where you think your territory should be is -not- the same thing as territory.  It only becomes territory when it can't be taken away from you anymore, so always have an invasion plan.  For example "If White invades group A which is worth roughly 20 points, I'll invade group B which is worth roughly 30 points"

Aside from the Elementary Go series I highly recommend Goproblems.com.  Teaching games are the best, of course, but if you're looking for ways to train and study I'd hit up that site.]
