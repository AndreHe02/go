C[Scartol> Hello there. This is Eric Piotrowski, aka Scartol. These days I'm 12k on IGS and 9k on KGS. Make sure you check out my Go art at <http://www.just-text.org/artofgo>. My comments will have the S> in front of them. It's hard to say what the "losing move" is, when the outcome is 3.5 points. That's pretty close. But there are a few things we should look at.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[qj]C[Katsura [23k?\]: I'm still a little vague on the concept of fuseki can u pls comment a little on my fuseki style?

S> This is very early. Go ahead and claim the remaining corner and hold off with the attacks. The stronger you are, the more powerful your attacks will be.]
;B[qo];W[qf];B[rd]LB[nc:A]C[S> Awkward black move. A is more common.]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[fc];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce]LB[bd:A]C[S> Again, awkward. A is standard.]
;W[ph]LB[jp:A][qh:B]C[S> This is very, very small. Black's corner enclosure makes A a very sweet (and urgent) spot. Play there instead. If you're worried about the cut at B, then make your original extension two spaces instead of three,]
;B[cj]LB[jp:A]C[S> This is a weak, indecisive move. The 3 black stones on the left are okay as they are (a little heavy, but not a big problem right now). For black, A is still much more important.]
;W[jd];B[kc];W[jc];B[ld];W[nd]LB[jp:A]C[Katsura [23k?\]: i wasn't sure if this invasion was a good one?maybe i should've played on the 3rd line instead?pls comment
S> No, this is good. But I would still prefer A.];B[nc];W[mc]
;B[oc];W[md];B[le]
(;W[kf]C[S> Never mind about the left side. You've invested three moves on that top invasion. Preserve them! See the variation.]
;B[lf];W[dg]LB[jp:A][cm:B]C[S> This doesn't threaten much. A is still the biggest spot; if you must attack black, B is a good way. Suppose black ignores this and moves into white's area? See the variation.]

(;B[cg];W[ke]
(;B[ne]C[S> Black is playing too closely. What would you do if black played the variation?]
;W[lc];B[kd];W[kb];B[lg];W[df];B[fq];W[cn];B[dq];W[ep]LB[jp:A]
[lq:B]C[S> This isn't very useful. It's essential that black not seal up that big bottom area. A or B are very urgent now.]
;B[eq];W[cq];B[cr];W[bq];B[br];W[ck];B[dj];W[kg];B[mq]
(;W[lh]C[S> Playing on the bottom is 100% essential right now. There really is no other move that even comes close.]
;B[jq];W[hg]C[Katsura [23k?\]: i realized dat i shouldn't have let black stretch away like dat..fatal mistake by me, pls comment on where i should've went]
;B[ql]
(;W[rl]LB[rk:A]C[S> This is playing too closely. If you're worried about black's big corner, play down there to reduce it. See variation. Suppose black had played at A instead of below?]
;B[rm];W[rk];B[pl];W[lk];B[ll];W[kl]
(;B[kk]C[S> Black is silly to crosscut here. His first priority should be to protect that huge corner. See variation -- and think about what you would have done.]
;W[jk];B[kj];W[lj];B[jj];W[jl];B[ij]
(;W[io]C[S> This move doesn't do much. Get into that corner! See variation.]
;B[im];W[lm]C[S> Good atari, but it's from the wrong direction.]
;B[ml];W[jm];B[in];W[hl];B[jn];W[hk];B[hj];W[hn];B[gj];W[dk]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[fk];W[fl];B[hm];W[gm];B[ho]C[Katsura [23k?\]: i should've connected here?

S> Yes, I think that's a better idea. Suppose black had set up a ko? See variation. Black can gain a lot and white could really lose a lot. Of course, white might benefit from a ko, so maybe it's not a good idea for black. Still, you should consider the possibility.]

Katsura [23k?\]: i shoul've played N14, i missed that play and it cost me the game
Katsura [23k?\]: pls comment

S> Well, yeah. Getting those stones would have been nice. But the truth is that black's corners and thick walls put him ahead strategically anyway. Don't fixate so much on this move -- you know what you did wrong, you should slow down in the future. But the issues of moyo building and timing are more important for you to work on.]

S> It's pretty small. A and B are bigger.];B[fg];W[fi];B[fj]
;W[de];B[eh]LB[ge:A][fe:B]C[S> At this point, black is connected. Danger WIll Robinson! Now your main priority must be to limit the damage he can do. A or B is a good way to start. Of course, that big black wall has just been waiting for a chance like this. The best way to stop him is to not let the wall develop in the first place (or at least build one of your own to face it).]
;W[gh]LB[ge:A]C[Katsura [23k?\]: when i played dis move i didn't feel very secure was it a bad move?

S> This is very very small. It saves one stone. Meanwhile, black can move up with A and eat up 10 points easily.]

S> This is an attachment, not a peep. When you're this close inside enemy territory, attaching is not a good idea -- it helps your opponent get stronger. A is better.]

;B[nn];W[mp];B[np];W[mn];B[lp];W[kp]C[Katsura [23k?\]: should i have allowed for ko here?
S> Yes. White is behind right now and needs to stay connected to those stones. Eating up that black corner is the only way white can win (unless black makes a dumb mistake somewhere). So the ko is good. But there are much better ko threats than the one you chose. Remember that a ko threat must always threaten more stones than the ones your opponent can take if he wins the ko. Since four white stones are at stake (which provide the chance for white to move in even deeper into black's territory), your attempt to get two black stones (and rescue two white ones) is not very threatening. See the variations.]
