C[$ dear reviewer , i'm black in this game. All my questions will be preceded by '$'

$ this game wasbig lost for me, so any comments will be useful.

prana: It is an interesting game where both players show a sound feeling for positional judgement and good fighting spirit.
If I may just give Black one advice, I would recommend to make better use of his thickness. 

It was a pleasure for me to review the game. 
Go on playing and enjoy it!

Only, r6 might be aji keshi. In case the black wall should become weak, you would rather want to play atari on q7.]

(;B[cf]LB[od:C][cf:A][do:B]C[$ best here ? or B ?

C[$ bigger than B, no ? Perhaps C better. Because low pincer leaded to destroy black's left border
prana: B is open on the right side, so B doesn't make really territory.
It is an interesting idea to switch to the right side.
D locally looks natural for me. But A should also work.
C is maybe to narrow to your wall.];W[cm]

;B[cp]TR[en][do]C[prana: the hane is an overplay. You are now losing the cutting stones, which are very important.
w will end with his weak stones connected.
Thus, black will hardly get advantage of his superior thickness in the center.
Taking away the corner is only destructive.
