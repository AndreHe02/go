AB[pd][dp]C[Hello my name is Imoto (this is my KGS nick) and my strength is arround 6kyu.

Well, let's get started.

The first thing I have to say is that you have concentrated too much on getting points at the center.
It is much more easier to get points on the outside (especially at the corners).

The next thing you should know is that your opponent has to play much more aggresiv than in an ordinary game with no handicap (called tagaisen) because of your advantage.
I think this is very important to know because if your opponent is a bit too aggresiv he/she will have a lot of weak (/attacking) points.

Keep also in mind that sometimes it is necessary to play aggresiv (like after the move number 16).]

[qi][cl][iq][jq]C[I think this move is perhaps quite small. Lots of better looking places to play. What looks best?

//

Well I think P4 is not such bad, because it built up
a litte wall while pressing (keep) white down (and put a bit preasure on him).

J3 is too small, K3 seems to be okay (then you play P3 before), because this puts a lot of high pressure on white.

S11 is too small, Q10 and R10 are also okay (but I would prefer R10  a bit more  because it's a bit more save).

K17 is not a good move, I think. J17 is much better, because you can better extend on the right or left side. (see Variations)

C8 is not bad in this situation because you have F3, on the other side it is much more easier when you play C11! (see Variations)

E17 is also okay (see Variations)

You should also keep in mind E16. (see Variations)]
(;W[qj];B[ql];W[qg]LB[pg:A][rg:B]C[I think w R13 is too aggresive.

You have 2 good possiblities.

Play "A" if you want to fight. (see the variations)

Play "B" if you want to play save. (see the variations)]
(;B[pf]C[This is too over-concentrated (see the variations before)]
;W[rf];B[re];W[sg];B[se];W[sf]LB[pg:A]C["A" is very important here]

(;B[ne]C[This is a bad move because it is too small and too over-concentrated (see the variations before).]
;W[qd]LB[qc:A]C[I guess I could've played somewhere else to stop this, but I did end up building a nice wall on the top.

//

Well the problem is that gaining terretory at the center area is very difficult because you need a lof of stones to get and protect it.

On the outside areas you need much more less stones (especially at the corners).

//

Simply play "A" to live in the corner.]

;B[kd];W[bp];B[cq];W[ck]LB[ec:B][kc:A][ed:C]TR[cf][df][cg][dg]
[ch][dh][di]C["A" is a key point here...

It is very crucial for black to play at  "A" before playing at "B" or "C" (of course).

I think 'C' is a bit better than "B" because white has a lot of weak spots on the upper left side (triangers).
A stone at 'C' surely helps you to get terretory there and puts white under preasure. (see Variation)]

(;B[ec];W[db];B[gd]C[I was looking to build some territory on the top here, but with the white stones already underneath my wall, perhaps this was ill-advised. What would be a better way to develop this corner?

It's difficult (but possible) for white to live after black have played "A". But black (so or so) will get a lot of terretory.]

//

You should play at O1 first (because white has to react on it or he/she will die).

(Keep in mind that Q13 is still a good move, too)

//

I think attacking at "A" is a good way to increase your terretory
while putting the white stone under pressure. (See the variations).

Your left group is more or less save (it is easy to live there).]

[km][mn]C[Let us have a short "look around" (even in an ordenary game it is quite useful if you are not under time preasure).

White has a lot of outside terretory (especially on the left).

Well, black has some outside terretory, too. But it is obvious that black mainly concentrates on the center...
Unfortunately, white has "A" and can decrease blacks terretory ( it's possible to kill the white group there but it won't be such easy for black).

The circles near the middle are showing the problem of blacks plan.

Black is widely open and need a lof of more stones to create save terretory at the center while white already has a lot of good and save terretory.

So, if black can't kill the white group on the right side he/she will lose!]
