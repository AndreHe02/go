C[I played an even game with a 16kyu player, and lost by about 60pts mainly because I couldn't seem to stake out enough territory, and my pieces ended up all clumped up.]
;B[pd];W[jq]C[i was kinda surprised at White's move here...I'm guessing he was trying to go easy on me or something
Ikk: Corner-Side-Center, in that order. White's move is doing side first.]
;B[pq]C[Ikk: Good, take corner. In this case though i like the C16 corner better, but it's very subtle.]
;W[jc]C[Ikk: Again, corner-side-center in that order.];B[lc]
C[Ikk: There are 2 empty corners to take instead of this move. Black doesn't need to respond to K17.]
;W[nc];B[le]TR[nd][qf]C[Ikk: This makes the fight more complex. Black can keep it simple with O16 or R14]
;W[ne];B[ng]LB[mf:A]TR[pf]C[Ikk: For black to attack the 2 white stones this way is pointless. White can cut through at A, and also Blacks top right corner is not strong enough yet. Q14 strengthen top right corner and attack white's 2 stone at same time.]
;W[mf];B[kf]LB[lf:A]C[Ikk: I prefer to follow the proverb here "When touched, touch back". So M14]
;W[mg];B[nh];W[lh]C[Ikk: This move doesn't really bother black. I prefer N12 here]
;B[mh]LB[pf:A]C[Ikk: Black should protect and connect at A, instead of this move. After A, Black's strong on the right and has free hand to do anything he want.]
;W[lg];B[dd]LB[pf:A]C[Ikk: This leaves lots of unfinished work at top group and top right group. Black don't need more weak groups at the board. Protect at A  and be strong.]
;W[fc]C[Ikk: I prefer a 2 point extension G17 for white here.]
;B[cg]LB[cf:B][df:A]C[Ikk: This is too far and has no effect what so ever on the fight. A would be my first choice, B my second.]
;W[fe]LB[ie:B][pf:A]C[Ikk: After these exchanges, Black has 2 weak groups to take care of. A helps top right group. B helps top group to gain a bit strenght before running out to the center]
;B[me]TR[pf]C[Ikk: This black move only invites white O14. After that black's weakness at Q14 is more and more severe.]
;W[nf];B[jg]LB[ie:B][pf:A][jh:C]C[Ikk: Black has to protect at A now instead of this. If black want to play around top group, B first then followed by C.]
;W[lj]LB[pf:A]C[Ikk: Blacks shape on the right has defect now. Time to attack at Q14 instead of this.]
;B[pj]C[Ikk: Again, Q14];W[qf]C[Ikk: This R14 is a bit far and give black a chance to fight back. Look at variation]

(;B[pf];W[pg]C[I'm
guessing I was very weak at defending my territory, which is why White could
encroach in here and there];B[qe];W[qg];B[re];W[of]
(;B[pe]TR[pf]C[Ikk: This stone is nothing. It's not a cutting stone, and not a vital stone. Black should ignore the atari and play P16, followed by P18 instead, as shown in variation.]
;W[qc]C[Ikk: Q18 seems like a better option than this one. Black P16 seems to contain enough danger for white.]
;B[pc]C[Ikk: P16 first then P18 seems to work for black.];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oa];W[oc]C[At this point, I think the 2 black stones at the top were already dead, but I didn't realise it]
;B[nb];W[mb]C[Ikk: White should N17 for reason soon we'll see.]
;B[mc];W[pa];B[nd];W[na];B[od]C[Ikk:];W[og];B[lb]TR[lb]C[Ikk: This move weakens white's top group a great deal.]
;W[oi];B[mj]
(;W[mk]TR[nj]C[Ikk : White missed a tesuji here. For low kyu players (who i'm sure will be the ones reading this review) it's a good tesuji to remember. It's called a "Clamping" Tesuji. The place is the marked spot. I've enclosed one variation to show you why those 4 black stones are dead with this tesuji. Have fun trying to find out the other variations.]
;B[nj];W[oj];B[nk];W[ok];B[nl];W[ol];B[om];W[ql];B[lk]C[I'm not sure how I could have prevented White from solidying that wall]
;W[kk];B[ll];W[pm];B[on];W[pn];B[oo];W[kl];B[li];W[kj];B[ki]
LB[ie:A][hf:B]TR[le]C[Ikk: This group are not absolutely safe yet. Black should play some defense with either A or B]
;W[lm]LB[ie:A][fg:B]TR[lb][fc][jc][fe]C[Ikk: These groups are not really safe yet.With black's stone there low on top, white need to play some defense move. A or B looks reasonable.]
;B[ml];W[cc]C[Ikk: This is a dangerous move for reason we can see soon.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce]LB[fc:A]C[Ikk: These exchanges only serves one purpose : White's group is weaker and weaker by the minute.]
;W[db]
(;B[df]LB[eb:A]C[Ikk: A is only move.];W[ec];B[ed]TR[dk]C[Ikk: Black should extend to marked spot instead of this move.]
;W[fd];B[ef]TR[dk]C[Ikk: Again.. marked spot];W[je]TR[ai][bi]
[ci][di][ei][fi][gi][hi][ii][ij][ik][il][im][in][io][ip][iq]
[ir][is]C[Ikk: Small. A quarter of the board is empty. White should've played in this area]
;B[ka]LB[kf:A]TR[fe][ii]C[Ikk: Now White's presence is high enough to present danger to Black's A Group. Black should play some defense move. Marked spot should do the trick.]
;W[hg];B[ig]TR[ii]C[Ikk:Marked spot is a better defense for black]
;W[hh];B[ji];W[mq];B[nq]TR[qp]C[Ikk: R4 in this case is a better option. h]
;W[nr];B[or];W[mr];B[np]C[Ikk: Black should R4 instead.];W[qp]
;B[qq];W[rp]C[Ik];B[rq]TR[dk][dp]C[Ikk: Black is alive and should've tenuki. Corner play is big. Even extension at D9 is good.]
;W[cp];B[cn];W[cl];B[en];W[el];B[ep];W[dq];B[dp];W[eq];B[co]
;W[bp];B[fp];W[fq];B[bo]TR[gn]C[Ikk: Empty triangles are usually bad. (not always, but in this case, it is. Making shape at G6 looks better.]
;W[dj]TR[di]C[Ikk: I woiuld've made the horse head shape here at D11. But with all those black stones around, this dog head shape might be a better move..]
;B[ap]TR[gn]C[Ikk: This is an endgame move, and should be saved for end game.Make shape with G6]
;W[aq];B[ao];W[bq];B[gq]LB[bm:A]TR[cn][gp][eq]C[Ikk: This white group is alive, so white can cut at G4. This black group in the other hand, is not alive yet, and is attackable.]
;W[gr];B[hq];W[hr];B[mo]LB[df:A]TR[ci]C[Ikk: Black's A group is not alive yet. if white plays E15, it has only one eye. Black need another move here. Marked spot should do it, i believe.]
;W[ci];B[ch];W[bi];B[bh];W[be];B[bf];W[bd];B[ai];W[hl];B[gn]
LB[ee:A][eh:C][dj:B]C[Ikk: There're 2 ideas that i find interesting here for white. First is to start attacking by removing the eye with A. But the fight could make it dangerous for white's B group. Another idea that's less risky is a play at C.]
;W[ho];B[go];W[hp];B[hn];W[gp];B[io]LB[iq:A]C[Ikk: White should just take at A]
;W[ip];B[jn]LB[jp:A]C[Ikk: Black should atari at A first before playing here.]
;W[jo];B[in];W[kn];B[ko];W[jp];B[lo];W[ij];B[ln];W[km];B[jj]
;W[jk]LB[eh:A]C[Ikk: Black should start securing this upper left group with A.]
;B[ik];W[il];B[hk];W[gk];B[hj];W[gj];B[hi];W[gi];B[ii];W[gm]
TR[gl]C[Ikk, White need not to fear G8 as it's safe.];B[fm]
;W[fl];B[hm];W[gl];B[jm];W[jl]LB[eh:A]C[Ikk: Black should protect at A, because white E15 is severe]
;B[dm]C[Ikk: the time is now ripe for white to attack the unsettled black group.]
;W[em]C[Ikk: There are some big plays left on the board. A, B]
;B[fn];W[dl];B[cm];W[bl];B[bm]LB[ee:A]C[Ikk: In game, White wanted to attack upper left group. A is the way to start the attack.  Look at variation. Of course there's this saying "Rich man should not pick fights". As white is now far ahead, white can just play defensive move and still win big.]

C[J18 is the way to go.];B[ja];W[ib];B[ia];W[gb];B[sp];W[so]
;B[sq];W[rn];B[po]TR[ie][sh]C[Ikk: Instead of this move, a monkey jump here is a bigger reduction. J15 is also another good reduction.]
;W[rf]C[Ikk: to reduce white's upper right in sente, black should start with P18, as shown in variation.]

(;B[se];W[rc];B[sc];W[sb];B[sd];W[ra];B[ma]C[Ikk: This obviously don't work.]
;W[la];B[cq]C[Ikk: This don't work either.];W[cr];B[ma];W[nb]
;B[la];W[ni];B[mi];W[oh]TR[ie]C[While all this move is played, the reduction at J15 remains.]
;B[mm];W[jf];B[kg];W[kd]C[From this point, it's all endgame move left. But it doesn't really affect the result in any big way, and so i will end my review here. I hope i didn't make too many mistake and this review has been of any use for you people who read this (If theres, any :P). For really new beginners who wants some help with their game, you can always look for ikkentobi in KGS Wing's Room.]
