RE[B+10.50]

AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Reviewed 20May2006 by Allan Wickberg (lobo2me@DGS)

Comments are marked "al>". As black is the one who asked for a review, my comments will be directed to black.

Usual disclaimer about me not knowing all the correct answers, being somewhere on the virge of becoming a one-digit kyu, is valid.

Thanks for entrusting your game with me - it is always fun to do reviews!]
;W[qf];B[qi];W[nc]
(;B[dj]C[al> There is no need to give away a corner or to let white connect to easily - P15 would be keeping the pressure on white, especially on the R14 stone.

al> Also, as a beginner, it is safer to play on the third line, so C10 instead would be more solid. It takes strenght to turn fourth line stones to territory as it is too easy to invade under them.]
;W[kq];B[mq]C[al> Later, you are asking hoe to avoid white invadeing the bottom right corner. Playing at O3 instead of N3 would make the corner safe. If Q4 had been on Q3, then this move would have been good. Now white could stir things up by playing P3, which has to be expected in a handicap game, where white has to take chances and make things complicated.]
;W[hq];B[fq];W[cn];B[bp]C[al> I would have played C5 here, as there is a black stone on the other side of C6. THat would put more pressure on the white stone. BTW, if black D10 had been on C10 instead, the pressure would have been so much more severe.]
;W[ck]C[al> With D10at C10, white would have had to run out instead.]
;B[cj];W[fc];B[ec]C[al> In this case, there are no black stones on the other side of  the white stone, which makes E17 less efficient. A pincer at H17 would have chased white toward the black stones at line #10, and also made it possible for black to make a group along the top, preventing white from getting territory there.]
;W[fd];B[df]C[al> With D14 at C14 instead, the corner is better protected, since white is strong on the outside.]
;W[ic]C[al> white gets an unnecessarily big top.];B[qm]C[al> With black N3 instead of O3, this stone shold be on R6 to protect the corner, or R8 to make a a group with R11. This gives white the opportunity to split black with R9, or to invade the lower right corner - or both.]
;W[qq]C[Here he ivade 3 3-3 points is there some way to stop this?

Or do i not need to stop it?

al> It is hard to stop this invasion since the supporting black stones are too far away from Q4. Better to try and maximize the territory along the right side.]
;B[qp]C[al> So far, so good.];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr]C[al> I would play O3 for stability. White cannot cut at P4 because of the ladder, and has to at least one more move to secure the corner. The black strenght can later be used to attack the L3-H3 stones. Black can thus build up strenght towards the white group to the left without white getting stronger at the same time.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]
(;B[pr]C[al> Not so good - even dangerous, in fact (see variation, white plays R5). White will live anyway, so it is better to strenghten the other black stones - R5 for instance, which forces white to make one more move to secure the corner, leaving black to play elsewhere first.]

(;W[qr];B[ps];W[sr]
(;B[qs];W[rs];B[os];W[qc]C[al> Black tries too hard to kill white and ends up in gote. Look at the number of stones black has invested and compare with what territory is gained.]
;B[pf]C[al> I don't like this move, but I have a hard time backing my opinion up since it gets very complicated in the corner. My gut feeling thinks R16 would be a better move for black because the alternative gives white a large corner, at the same time as not creating a good black wall facing the center. White can answer Q14 with Q13, for instance.]
;W[qd]C[al> I believe white should have played Q13 instead, with the prospect of stopping black from getting a moyo in the center.]
;B[pg];W[pc]
(;B[od]C[al> I perceive this as a change of direction. Q15 would be more interesting to me, in that it builds a better wall for black towards the center. The reason to play R15 instead of Q15 is that black gets to build the wall in sente.]
;W[nd]
(;B[oc]C[al> Aside from making an open triangle - which is bad - P17 also goes in the wrong direction, I think. Since black is still in the lead, it makes for better economics to try to enlarge black's territory instead of trying to reduce white's. This is not a severe attack on white anyway.

al> A hane at O15 looks better to me, as it prevents white from extending into the center.]
;W[ob]
(;B[nf]C[al> A hane at O15 still looks better - O14 leaves too big holes for white to exploit, due to the black triangle that has only two liberties.]

(;W[ne];B[mf]C[al> Black gives away at least six points here by sacrificing the P16 group. It is hard to say if the return will be a substantially large center moyo, but sinec it is always hard to make points in the center, this seems to be questionable. P14 saves the black stones and strenghtens the wall towards the center.]

(;W[cc];B[cd];W[eb]
(;B[nj]C[al> I feel that this move is too small, in that it, again, give away too much of the corner to white. A moyo in the center is always tempting, but one should not underestimate the value of a corner - and it is impossible to underestimate the value of a center moyo, at least for us amateurs.

al> O10 does not put much pressure on white, and as it is hard enough to invade the right side, it does not do much to pretect it either. At least B17 should be played before going elsewhere.]
;W[ln];B[lc]C[This invation is too deep where should i go instaed?

al> White is streching a little too far with M6, so a good option is to play L5 or M4 to cut the knight's move and attack both white's groups at once.

al> Saving the P16 group, by playing P14 is worth more than M17.

al> Besides that, invading the top is not necessary. It is too tight and it is better to just play something like K16 or L15 to reduce it instead. Generally one should stay on a distance from thickness, inthis case the white wall at the O-line, so the move should in all cases be further to the left.]

(;B[kp]C[would M 4 be better here?

al> Black is in dire need to reduce white's center moyo, and to do that it is easier to extend into it from the open side, that is from the north-east in this case. Black also has the option of attacking the leftmost white group by playing E5 or D5, and chasing it into the white moyo, if not capture it altogether.

al> Also, L13 is big in terms of reducing white's potential territory.]

C[Is this too thick?];W[fn];B[fm];W[gm];B[eo]C[al> I think E5 should be at E6 instead.]

(;W[fo];B[en]C[al> This capture was critical for black to have chance at winning. Remaning large plays to reduce are at P14, B17, and L13.]

;W[ef];B[gg];W[eh]C[Can i win this ko?

al> Winning the ko does not give black much gain - the black H13 group has fewer liberties than the white K10 group even if black captures both E12 as well as G12. It would have been interesting if the black H13 group was alive, but even then it would take pretty big ko threats to work. I have played out a possible ko fight, disregarding the flaw, just to fool around a bit. As it turns out, there seems to be little gain for black.]

[sf][gg][hg][fh][hh][ih][gi][ii][hn][go][sq][gr][rr][ss]C[al> To summarize, black lets white get territory a little to easily, considering the asset that the handicap stones are. White really shold not be able to get such big moyos in a 4 stone handicap game, unless black get even bigger ones in return. Black would have lost, had it not been for white goofing at the bottom in the endgame.

al> When given a handicap - at least in the case of four stones or more - there is usually good opportunities to force white to live small while building territory at the same time. Black should strive for larger moyos rather than to reduce white, at least to the point where white is cathching up, something that usually happens sooner or later (else there would be no need for a handicap, right?)

al> At the same time, black can afford to play rather safely in the beginning, so as to build solid, not too easily to invade, territory, since white can be expected to be good at invading. That is, third line moves, rather than fourth line ones.

al> Considering that double digit kyu's are not so consistent that handicap is really fair, I would say that this was pretty good play for a 23k, anyway.]
