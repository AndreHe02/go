AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hi Will,

you have asked for additional comments on this teaching game, in particular controlling the flow of the game and "big points". From this game I would suggest that you'll benefit most from working on the shape of your stones, i.e. efficient shapes and connections. This is more of a tactical issue than strategic. However, with better shape your opponent will be unable to dominate the game as easily (controlling the flow of the game).

All of my comments are preceeded by a >>

Regards,

;B[kc];W[jf];B[oc]LB[ob:C][pb:B][pc:A]C[>> There is no need to attach here. If you are concerned about the corner and want to secure it I would consider A, B, or C (in order of preference). Each of these connections acts to limit whites options in the corner without giving white any leverage like the triangle stone does. A is strong and leaves little potential for white. B and C leave a little more potential for white to cut or peep but robs white of eyes along the edge.]

(;B[ob]TR[oc][pd]C[>> While you should not play submissively, playing safely is a good idea in a handicap game. Remember that it is white who needs to take risks, not black. Here, I think the black stones have poor shape, which white exploits. Q17 would be better in my opinion (see variation).]
;W[pe];B[qd];W[pf]LB[oe:A]TR[pg]C[>> At this point, the only place for white to possibly create an eye is A. So white needs to escape or create eye-space. The marked stone is weak and provides an opportunity for white. It is this stone that needs support.]

;B[pm]LB[ql:A][qn:B]C[>> Once again, the two point extension is a little weak and later in the game white exploits this weakness. Personally, I would play at A, which acts to defend against white sliding along that edge and still makes an invasion near B unattractive.]
;W[jg];B[kh]C[>> This stone forces white to make a move that he would already like to make and does little to help black. Try to avoid making moves like this.]
