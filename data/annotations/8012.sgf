AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[M: Hi, this is a 5 stone handicap game I played.

P: Hi! 

My name is Jan and I play as 5th kyu (sometimes 6th kyu when I'm in bad shape) on KGS as "PeatMan". 
I will review your game. I think you never were in danger of losing the game. For commenting it is best to send games you lost or almost lost. Nevertheless there are enough moves to comment on.
I hope you'll find it usefull.];W[qn]
(;B[qq]C[P:
I like O3 more.
Q6 is also good. 
This definately gives you the corner, but R3 is too timid to my taste.]
;W[qk]MA[qf]C[P:
White is cautious and establishes a base here, but it gives you the opportunity to approach him.
Usually white plays R14, instead of his last move and then plays around Q10.]
(;B[qh]SQ[qf][pf]C[P:
I think this is  a little too far. This gives him the chance to invade at Q14 or R14 and split you. I'd play R13 instead of R12..
Taking another starpoint K16, D10 or K4 is also nice.];W[rp]
LB[rp:C][qf:B][qh:A]C[P:
Mwaah.... I don't like this move by white. This is a handi-game.
White has to invade at Q14 or R14. Aggression and  intimidation should be the keywords of white's strategy.

Move C would be good if white had to make a base but he's fine so I think this is too small for now. So even if this wasn't a handicap game there would be better moves.]
;B[mq]LB[nq:A][np:B]N[6 (N3)]C[M: Feels low but it was the best move I could think of.

P: O3 or O4 make familiar good shape here. but experiment if you like.
I'd do O4 and try for P6 next.
I don't think your move is bad, though I may not be strong enough to criticise correctly.]
;W[cn];B[ck];W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[P:
You can split him, (wich is good I think) but alternatively you could take the central bottom and seal him in. 
The alternative would leave more aji, favorable for white. So I think your choice is better. Provided you had made the solid connection and sealed the corner group with move 20 at G5.]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[bq]
(;B[bn]C[P:
I'd definately prefer a solid connection at the marked place.

The usual continuation is as the variation. 
(Source: http://senseis.xmp.net/?44PointLowApproachTwoSpaceLowPincer)]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[fq];B[hq];W[fr]C[M: I'm quite content with this result, he may get the corner but my stones work towards the other handicap stones.

P: True, but I'd finish it with G5.];B[pn]SQ[co]TR[go]MA[bn]
C[M: Maybe not the best move at the moment but as in the lower left I wanted him to live narrow while I built walls for my large framework

 P: 
I'd seal him in at G5 and the stone at B6 should have been at C5  to be more solid. This leaves more possibilities for him to break through your wall.

I think the damage he can do around G5 is bigger than the damage he can do around Q6.]
;W[pm]SQ[on]C[M: Should have expected this...

P: Yes, White follows the proverb saying: "When touched: hane!".
I think you can better place the stones at some more distance, like P6.]

Good. Keep him separated.];W[hp];B[ho];W[gp];B[iq];W[nc];B[lc]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[P:
You don't seem to be afraid of pincers, wich is good. A lot of players of your strength dislike them because they think they are scary.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nb]C[P:
Again: connect at P17];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[pf]
;B[qg];W[re];B[ne];W[of]
(;B[oe]C[P:
Making a bamboo joint at O16 is better shape: much stronger.]

;W[rj];B[ri]SQ[nk][oj][oi][oh][of][pf]LB[om:A]C[P:

Outch! You should connect at "A". His marked group can be attacked after your connection. Who cares about an eye (1 point) when you are connected?]
;W[om]
(;B[nm]C[M: No misclick on my part.... I wanted to try and invade his territory.

P:
Which territory? Take care you don't get killed.
Better would be to make eyes with R10 and or try to break out.]
;W[nl]
(;B[qo]C[M: But this wasn't the way to go....

P: True. Your group is isolated and might be killed.
Atari on R7 doesn't help the group. With R8 you can live. (or cause trouble for white.)]
;W[rn];B[qj]C[P:
If you wanted to move here, making move R8 first would be better.
Similair as in a previous variation.];W[ph];B[qi];W[rk];B[ro]

(;B[ng]TR[ne][oe][pe][pd][pc]MA[mf][lf]LB[nf:A][mg:1]C[P:

Mwhaa... White might push at "A" and create lots of cutting points. If you wanted a wall facing the central top one of the marked spots would be better. Now also becomes clear that a bamboo joint would be better than the carpenters square. Then Black "1" would have been much more solid.]
(;W[mj]
(;B[lg]LB[ng:A]C[P:

This stone ccould have been placed more efficiently if "A" would be more to the left.]

;B[cf];W[ee];B[be];W[is];B[ir];W[hs];B[jr]TR[gr]C[M: Here I already knew the triangle spot was the move I needed to get.]
;W[gb];B[gf];W[ge];B[hb];W[ha];B[ia];W[ga];B[jb];W[gc]C[P: 

Very small move by white. 

Lets count. (approximately)
White: 35 (upper & central right) + 15 (lower left) + 10 (upper left) + 12 
           prisoners = 72
Black: 40 ( Left) + 30 (lower right) + 30 (upper central)  + more prospects
           elsewhere e.g. in the center = 100+

Black is clearly ahead. White cannot afford this kind of small moves.
Despite the dead group on the right he's still behind. White should cause trouble for black.]
;B[ln];W[gn];B[hn];W[gm];B[fm];W[gr]TR[js]C[M: Don't know if he was making a base or just preparing for pushing at the triangle. Although I had seen it I neglected to play there myself.

P: I doubt if white would need a base. He already has one and I think he can not be killed. So why this move? It's another small move.
I'd try to spoil some more of blacks territory. or cause trouble. F8 looks nice to me.]
;B[hm];W[js];B[kr];W[ks];B[ms];W[lr];B[lq];W[mr];B[nr];W[ls]
;B[ns];W[nq]C[P:
White is trying, but would his be the right spot?
I have the feeling white cannot expect to succeed here.];B[oq]
;W[np];B[or];W[mo];B[mn];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp]C[P:

After this white triies too hard i.m.o. to get out.
In the end he almost managed to connect everything, despite mistakes on both sides.]
(;B[lo]C[P: 
No, just catch him with K6. Splitting isn't nescessary.];W[jn]

(;W[lj]C[M: White's mistake (that cost him the game?)

P:
Nice catch, but no: The game was lost for white anyway.];B[nj]
;W[ni];B[nk]C[M: Gote move on my part, I realised seconds after playing it that I could have taken my sente and played elsewhere.

P:
Another small move we kyu's (like me) often seem to make. :-)]
;W[mh];B[mg]
(;W[gl]TR[hl][hm][hn][ho]C[P:
No! White should connect K9 to G12.
Probably he wanted to capture the marked group but he can't expect black to allow that.]
;B[hk];W[fl];B[dm];W[el];B[em]C[P:
Like in the top right: bamboo at D6 is more solid]
(;W[gj]C[P:
Connecting the K9 group would be a better idea.];B[ij];W[hj]
;B[ik];W[jh];B[hi]
(;W[gi]C[P:
Why not try to connect with H12. It shouldn't work but who knows black lets white connect.]
;B[hh];W[ii];B[ji];W[kh];B[lh];W[ki];B[ih];W[jf]C[P:
White is dead and adding more stones to his dead group.];B[li]
;W[kj];B[kf];W[kg];B[je];W[ke];B[lf]
(;W[if]C[P:
Peeping with a dead group is useless. White might try to make a ko. Again: it should not work if black is wise enough but he has to try something.]
;B[hf]C[M: Thank you for your review!

P:

As said: You never were in danger of losing the game. White caused too little trouble. The only big thing was the group on the left that seemed to get killed because you did not connect, but lived later on because you got lucky.
But even if white had  captured this group you'd be OK.

Try to make good shape.  See the two instances were you should better make indestructable bamboo joints instead of awkward carpenter squares.

Try to connect weak groups, like black S11 that should have been at P7.

Consider attacking groups by not touching their stones  but to take their possible eye space and/or block escape routes. Attacking is usually done at a distance. When you touch your opponents stones you usually help him to settle.

Thank you for showing us your game.])
