  Commentary by Pekka Karjalainen, aka other 8k* in IGS.

  Requested by CptQuasar, who plays black with six stones.

  Overview:  It is hard to evaluate a game like this.  As often happens in a high handicap games, white gets the best of black in most local situations.  I have tried to give variations and suggestions which show waht need not have happened.

  Instead I might have also suggested simpler ways of playing, which are appropriate in handicap games.  I decided not to do this very extensively, since I felt this review would be better if it concentrated on matters which are also most useful in even g
ames.

  I sincerely hope this review will be interesting and useful.

  -- Pekka];W[jq];B[jd]C[  This is a good move, taking an important point on the upper side.]
;W[nc];B[oc]C[  This is the strongest attacking move that black can play here.  It aims at making white heavy and attacking him while gaining profit.

  However, black makes several mistakes in following up to this play.  I will point them out and suggest alternatives.]
;W[nd];B[pf]C[  This is joseki.  So far all is well.];W[jb]
C[  White slides to K18.  This move is a bit thin and black can gain an advantage by proper play.  Yet it is often seen in handicap games, white trusting that black does not find a good answer or is afraid of starting a fight.]

(;B[eb]C[  This move is rather strange.  Considering that black has more urgent moves it is a little too slack.

  It also is not very effective.  There is still a gaping hole from D16 to D10, where white can later aim to enter.  C13 is the defending move I would want to make here.

  I have given a variation for black.  Please go back and study it carefully.]
;W[id]
(;B[ke]C[  Please study the variation I have given.  Instead of moving out there is a way to attack white.

  Instead of this I would consider K14 to be better style if moving out.  This move seems a little slow.]
;W[if];B[kg]C[  This is good style.  The diagonal move made earlier also helps to defend against a later wedge by white at L13, so it is still an ok move.]
;W[lf];B[kf]C[  White has managed to force black a bit too much.  But as long as black can get out in one piece it will still be his game.]
;W[mh];B[ne]C[  I cannot see what black is aiming at with this move.  The following moves show that white cannot be easily cut in two here.

  K17 instead would still do the trick.];W[me];B[md];W[ld];B[mc]
;W[mb]
(;B[mf]C[  M15 could give a better result.  Please go back and study the variation.]
;W[le];B[mg];W[lg]C[  Now black is too thin to carry out this attack any further.]
;B[lh];W[nf];B[ng];W[oe];B[of];W[kh];B[li];W[jh]C[  White managed to capture the black stones.  A setback for black, but there is still a lot more in this game.

  The attack from O15 on was unreasonable.  In a high-handicap games black should always be very careful about starting a fight, or things like this will happen.  It could even be said that white wins handicap games most often because of black playing lik
e this.];B[ni]C[  A safe move.  Please note that white still has an atari at O12, making this capture less than perfect.  Yet the ladder capture at O12 would also leave white the possibility of a ladder-breaking forcing move.

  Nevertheless white cannot move his stone out yet, because of the ko at O15.]
;W[pn];B[nq]C[  This is a good answer, threatening the stone at K3 a little while defending at the same time.]
;W[gq]
(;B[fq]C[  Perhaps black should attack the lone white stone on the right instead of playing this.  Please study the variation for a possible sequence.]
;W[gp];B[nn];W[qp]C[  Earlier I gave the black move at R5 in a variation.  It would avoid giving white this move.]
;B[qq];W[qo]
(;B[pl]C[  Playing at S3 instead is considered in the variation.  Please go back and look at the variation.]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[qm];B[qk]C[  This is similar to the variation given earlier, except that white can now take S3 and probably should do so too.]
;W[pe]
(;B[qd]C[  Why not connect at R15?  Please go back and study the variations for possible results.]
;W[qe];B[qf];W[rd];B[rc];W[se]C[ I think S14 could be better.]
;B[rf]C[  And that is because of this.];W[re];B[ne]C[  Good - this ko is still greatly in black's favor.]
;W[lc];B[od];W[nf];B[qn]C[  This is a bad ko-threat.  White will be happy to capture it, since it helps his group to make life.  S6 is the move that black threatens to make.

  Please consider playing at S6, threatening this instead.  Doesn't it look better?  It also leaves more threats for black to aim at later.

  Ko-threats seem to be by nature moves that come in pairs.  Move A threatens move B, unless answered.  Please make it a habit of considering both moves as viable options before playing the threat.]
;W[rn];B[ne];W[ob]
(;B[nf]C[  Wrong! You really should have noticed the white move at R17.  Please go back see the variation.]
;W[qc]C[  White captured the corner with this.];B[kq]C[  This is not a very good move.  Contact plays are rarely efficient attacking moves.

  I would suggest S3, threatening the eye-space of the group on the right, then C7 to defend the side if white answers.]
;W[kp]C[  This white response should tell you why L3 is bad more clearly than anything I can say!]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[mp];W[cn];B[en]C[  This is playable.  Trying to take the corner with C5 would be very small if it worked.  And I am not so sure it would.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[bp]
(;B[gn]C[  You missed something very useful.  Please go back and see the variation.]
;W[hn];B[gl];W[cf]C[  Apparently both players missed the move at B5.  Hmm.

  It could also be that white felt that he could not play there yet and kept on playing blithely, hoping black will not find the key point.  One often has to do things like that to win a handicap game.]
;B[ce];W[df];B[eh]C[  This move seems to leave a lot of room for white to slide in later.  How about C12 instead? And that B5 biggie then ?]
;W[ff];B[gh];W[cc]
(;B[dc]C[  Please see the variation.  It appears that this answer is almost forced.  Please notice that it makes black E18 look like a very bad move though.

  The bad shape -move at C16 could be another possibility.  It is not wrong to make bad shape if you get a good result otherwise, after all.]
;W[be]
(;B[cd]C[  Please go back and see the variation for another defense.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[bo]C[  With this move it is starting to look like white's game.]
;B[cl];W[ci];B[di];W[ch];B[ln]C[  S3 is bigger.];W[kn];B[lm]
C[  It turns out black could play this sequence in sente, so it was not that bad.  But how about L7 here instead?]
;W[km];B[gd];W[fd];B[fc];W[ge];B[ed];W[fe];B[hd];W[ic];B[he]
;W[ie]C[  Cutting at H14 would only provoke white B9.];B[hc]
C[  But this move is not good either.  It is too small to make at this time and instead of it H18 would be better shape.]
;W[fo]
(;B[fn]C[  Oops.  Please go back and study the variation.];W[eo]
;B[dn];W[do]C[  This was very big.  It looks like the game is over.  Only a few comments on local technique follow.]
;B[ih];W[jg];B[kk];W[jj];B[jk];W[ij]C[ Black provoked this move, but it reduces the potential black territory on the left.]
;B[ji];W[ii];B[ki];W[hh];B[hi];W[hg];B[hj];W[ik];B[hk]C[  This was an interesting sequence.  Perhaps black K9 wasn't so bad after all.]
;W[il];B[rl]C[  S3 instead.];W[rm];B[rp]C[  S3 instead.  The descent does not have to be reinforced.]
;W[rk]C[  ...against a cut like this.];B[ro];W[pq];B[po];W[qn]
;B[oq]C[  S3?];W[rq];B[pr];W[rr];B[qr];W[qj];B[pk];W[qi]
(;B[pi]C[  Please go back and see the variation.];W[bk];B[ck]
;W[bl];B[qh];W[ri];B[rh];W[sl];B[jr];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr];B[jl]
;W[jm]C[  Black made an empty triangle and now it is short of liberties.]
;B[hm];W[kj];B[lj];W[lk]C[  Ouch.];B[mk];W[kl];B[ll];W[in];B[kk]
;W[is];B[js]C[  This is a bad idea.  White could play at L2 and capture.]
;W[hs];B[kr]C[  Luckily he didn't.  Bad move turned into a good one.]
;W[lo];B[mo];W[on];B[om];W[oo];B[cj];W[bj];B[ef];W[eg];B[ee]
;W[fh];B[fi];W[fg];B[gg];W[gf];B[gi];W[hf];B[go];W[cm];B[dm]
;W[ac];B[bb];W[ab]C[  Now you might want to refer to the corner variation given much earlier.  It should be apparent that the recommended defense gets black more points.]

;B[ic]C[  A possible ko-threat.  There are many others.];W[hd]
;B[ne]C[  Now white has no ko-threat that is big enough.  Black can capture with the next move to save the corner stones.

  And since black still have many more ko-threats on the board, it would also be possible to delay winning the ko for a while.  That is more advanced strategy though, so please do not ask me about it!  That is something I just heard dan-players talking ab
out...]))
(;B[qe]C[  This should be the default answer in this or similar situations.  The cuts may look scary, but let's look at them closely.]

(;W[qf];B[ne]C[  It looks like a ko, but white has no threat big enough.]
;W[dn]C[  To pick one example.];B[od]C[  Absolutely huge.  And what's more, next black threatens M17.  White is forced to defend, and black can go back to the lower left corner first.]
)

;B[ne]C[  No threat big enough.])))
(;B[rq];W[ql];B[rk];W[rl];B[qk]C[  White is in trouble.  However, he still has chances to escape via P5, for example.]
))
(;B[qo]C[  First take the corner safely.  This is a good corner shape to remember - now it is too late for white to invade at R3.

  Making this shape is often too slow, though.  Here it is ok, since this move also attacks white.]
;W[pk]C[  Possible way to stabilize on the right for white.]
;B[qj]C[  Descending is a very solid answer here.  White would love the opportunity to crosscut at R10 if black R9.]
;W[nn]C[  White is still weak on the right and black can aim to attack the group.  A feasible strategy would be to start a leaning attack at K4.

  You may ask what is a leaning attack.

  If white answer K4 etc. docilely, taking territory on the lower side, the resulting black wall will be very useful in attacking the white group on the right.  Leaning on the other group first is a very strong way to attack another.

  I will present a sequence.];B[jp];W[kq];B[kp];W[lq];B[lp]
;W[mq];B[mp];W[nr];B[ll]C[  This sequence is definitely not recommended for white.  Yet it will be hard to find the proper answer to K4, which is exactly the reason it is a good move for black to make.]
))
(;B[le];W[lc]C[  White N14 instead of this would lead to a worse result.  Material for further study.]
;B[mf];W[nf];B[md];W[oe];B[me]C[  Now white will probably manage to connect at P16 and P14.  Black has to defend the side first, but this will lead to getting a little bit of territory in the bargain.

  The group in the middle is in no great danger yet.  There is a lot of room to move out at around K12 and K17 would still be painful for white.]
))
(;B[jc];W[ic];B[kb];W[ib];B[lc]C[  White is cut into two groups again.  The only thing black has to avoid now is being captured by K15.  Let's look at it.]
;W[je];B[mc];W[nb];B[ke];W[kd];B[kc];W[ld];B[md]C[  No capture.  White should not play this sequence at all.]
))
(;B[jc]C[  Hitting white from above is very solid.  There are several other moves to consider, like J18 or L18, but this one is least likely to lead to complications.

  The important thing here is that black can make several forcing moves against white and get a good result.]
;W[kb]C[  It can not be expected that white will play this move every time.  But if he does not, black can attack him even more severely with accurate play.

  As an example, consider white J18 in place of this move.  After that, black M17 cuts white's two groups apart.]
;B[le]C[  This move threatens to enclose white with O14.  Let's consider what happens if white does not allow this.]
;W[nf];B[lc];W[lb];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[mc]C[  White can connect, but his shape is far from ideal.  Black can be happy, having solidified his corner at the same time.]
;B[ib]C[  Black could use this move to attack white's eye shape next.  A possible continuation follows.]
;W[hb];B[hc];W[ia];B[ic];W[gb];B[fc]C[  White can make eyes, but will be pressed into a low position on the second line if he does so.  For black this would be a great advantage.

  The move at K18 is not very good for white, if answered like this.  Yet it is not easy, for in a handicap game white will probably have many tricks up his sleeve no matter what way black plays.

  It should also be noted that it will be very hard for black to stop white from enroaching somewhat on the upper side after K18.  As long as white is kept in a low position, this should be allowed, since it will not be easy to stop.  Also, more important
ly, black will be able to build influence facing the center at the same time.]
