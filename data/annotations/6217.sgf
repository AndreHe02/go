;B[pp]C[This is a game I played recently and I felt like my opening
was pretty horrible; I have the most trouble there.
Anyways, thanks for reviewing this :) .];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[qi]
;W[nq]C[SB- Typical answer for Chinesse opening.

Ten - fifteen years before it was very popular.];B[lq]C[SB- Old answer aiming for territory. Black  followed main directive of Chinesse - making big moyo.]

(;W[no]C[SB- But white answered in good style of present days. No objections. 

Good for all.];B[pn];W[kp];B[lp];W[lo];B[kq];W[jp];B[jq];W[ip]
;B[hq];W[go];B[fq]C[SB- Unusual, but playable. Better is G3 as black group becomes stronger.]

(;W[dj]C[Too far?

SB- No. When You play on hoshi (4-4) in the corner it is natural to develop later on 10-4.  

But, now it is too early. First finish developing your wall with 20 on H4.]
;B[cn]
(;W[fp];B[eq];W[co];B[dn];W[dq];B[ep]C[SB-  Black use this cut. Good for him.]

(;W[bn]C[SB. Correct follow up.];B[bm];W[bo];B[eo]C[I really didn't like this; I got the corner, but my F4 and G5
stones are in horrible position.  Do you see any better
sequence for white?


SB- You've right. It is painful when black promote his cut to joining move. You could avoid this with 20 on H4.]

(;W[jc];B[cf];W[ch];B[ef];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[bc];W[bb];B[cd]
;W[dc];B[de]C[SB- Now white is again on the move.]
(;W[cl]C[SB- Little slack. Slow . White could cut on C7, why not?
Also B8 is an option. There is no reason to flee from fight here.]
;B[cm]C[I was thinking about an oogeima here (F13) but decided
not to because he could attack my weak group and
cause a lot of trouble.  What do you think?

SB- Yes,  exchange W44 on C8 for B45 on C7 was bad for white.
Now white is in position to think about his weak group on the left.]
;W[eh];B[gf];W[he]C[SB- This is something what we have to avoid - Bad shape. White 48 is inefficient.  Black made tenuki after it. 

Mistake. Think about this.];B[lc];W[pe]C[SB- Finally, this is  it.

Most of Chinesse openings include this approach.];B[qe]

C[Was there any way to make my whole group live?

SB- See solution with white 94 on R1. White finished in gote.
This is main reason I think white 94 on R1 was 
better.];B[gn];W[hn];B[gm];W[hm];B[gl];W[gh]C[Any better way to deal with black's invasion?

black from getting points on the side too?

SB- See move 168 on J14 sequence.
Now You have even less center territory.  And what You are asking yourself, there is no territory for black on left side after that .]

SB- This move is bad for white. White gives sente to black. No profit for white, therefore it was better to play something else. S1 was better. See previous comment.
