C[White can move at D6 any time he likes. The exchange w's D6 and b's C7  is disadvantagous for white.]
;B[kp]C[B's L4 should be R6 or Q6. Black has  got enough profit with C7.]

 Malick 7k*: I was just reading your stats.  How do you use the beep  command?

I have not used beep.];W[lq]C[
 Malick 7k*: didn't work.
 Malick 7k*: did that work?
 rsfee 3k*: j4?   Malick 7k*: ok];B[kq]C[
 rsfee 3k*: l3 looks too heavy];W[iq]C[J3 should be M2.];B[fo]C[I really struggled with this move.  I  wanted to get around to an attack at n4 but couldn't see a way to get there  without provoking white to play there.  L6 was my other choice.  Anyway,  what do you think?

I can't understand black's strategy with the move at F5. He has to move at  M2.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[ep]C[E4 should be G3.];B[go]C[G5 also should be  M2.];W[gq]
C[
 Malick 7k*: sorry to be so slow.];B[in];W[nm];B[pl];W[ph]C[White's Q12 should be around L6.  Center is important now.]
;B[mn];W[nn];B[mp];W[mq];B[np];W[lp];B[mo];W[lo];B[ko];W[op];B[oq]C[P3  should be P5. Here black must take sente.]
;W[oo]C[The plan here was to split  these two white groups.  Clearly, that didn't work.]
;B[or]C[Black's P2  should be Q3. Q5 is a big threat.];W[nr]C[I can't understand O2.
M6 is a natural move.];B[qr];W[lm]C[M6 is better than M7.  M7 leaves two way kikashis L6 and N8 from black.]
;B[kn];W[ln];B[dm]C[D7  should be K8. Center is now important.];W[dh];B
[qf]C[I am still worried  about the black stones in the bottom center, but feel a little better with  d7 in place.  Now I want to start working on the right side and get some  benefit of the sente move at n8 in attacking the white stone at  q12.]
;W[qj]C[White's Q12 is a light stone. So, both b's R14 and w's R10  should be around  K17.]
;B[ql];W[nc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[kc];B[ml];W[nl]C[O 8  should be N7. This move jeopadize w's two stones group on right  side.]

(;B[nk]C[O9 is very similar to D7. Both are sticking to  oppornent's very strong groups. P10 is better.
One move back and cf. var2.];W[ok];B[ol];W[oj];B[me]C[N15 strengthen the  white group.]
;W[ld];B[rh];W[mi];B[lj];W[li];B[kj]C[White's group on right   side is weak. So I recommend var2.]

(;W[kl];B[ij];W[il]C[Now having the two  week groups is starting to hurt.  I try to get out without letting the white  stones on the right loose.]

[el];B[fk];W[hk];B[gk];W[hj];B[hl];W[fl];B[gl];W[fn]C[This seemed like  a mistake to me.  It gave me a move I really needed.  But where to use  it?

F6 should be D10 or H11 or around L13.];B[ik];W[ii]C[J11 should be  H11.]
;B[ji];W[ih];B[jh];W[lf]C[I figured this m!
 ove (m
14) was the end of the game for me.  It pulls the white stones out and  pretty well cuts off the black ones in the  center.]
;B[ig];W[gi];B[hh]C[Direct move as this H12 end up catastrophy. Need  patience. L14 is recommended.]
;W[hi];B[fi]C[I'm kind of slashing along here  trying to make some confusion and gain some liberties for my two weak  groups.]
;W[gh];B[kg];W[lg];B[le];W[kf];B[jf];W[ke];B[hg];W[fh];B[mh];W[mj]C[this  was the turning point.  At the time I thought it was a great move, but it  ended up in gote and I got to make the cut.

N10 should be  M12.];B[ll];W[nj];B[lk];W[km];B[lh];W[ki];B[kh];W[ng];B[nh]
;W[og];B[jd]C[thi   s was probably foolish.  If white ignores the peep I doubt I can win the  fight.  But I was still afraid I would lose a capturing race and wanted to  open up my center  group.]

 white resigns.

Generally speaking, if both players take care of board's center, it would  help you a lot.

Thank you for your request of my  review.])
