C[Hi,

 I'm interested in what were the main errors in the game and comments
 to the general strategy (which is my weak point). To me, it seemed
 like we both played OK in the beginning, but I started slipping in
the early middle game but my opponent started then doing mistakes in
 the late middle game. Of endgame, I wasn't sure, but I felt like I
 was doing slightly better there than my opponent.

 There are also some comments from me in the SGF for points that I
 was thinking while playing.

 My opponent was also interested in the review, especially comments
 to the corner invasions on the right that eventually failed.

 Thank you in advance for the review!

Hi!
I'm Igor' (Felisratus 4kyu on KGS) and I'll do my best to review your game. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me (PM on KGS or mail to felisratus@gmail.com). 
P.S.: I'm not a native speaker, so sorry for my bad english.]

[ee:B][cf:D]TR[ec]SQ[cd]C[TH: Not sure which is the right direction here - mainly I wanted
to enforce the lone white stone and start building territory
towards black low-left corner eventually.


I think these are two different questions.
It is a very good idea to reenforce e17 stone now, but... I don't think, that c13 is the proper move for this purpose. This is a "high level" shape, the one can often be seen in pro games. Black can respond from A to D (and a lot of other moves), which leads  to numerous joseki variations with almost unpredictable results for both sides (since you are not a high dan player =). Playing this way could certainly be interesting. But if you want to improve your Go, the very good idea is to make moves, which you can understand. In this way h17 would be the good, simple move to reenforce e17 stone and put some pressure on B L17 group.

About "building territory
towards black low-left corner" see comments in the vaviation, starting from this move.]

(;W[ck]C[TH: With the following move, I wanted to pressure black a bit
while building up my own territory, but I'm not sure everything
went right: Black got a large corner while my own framework felt
too loose.

You can't pressure black here, his corner is very strong! But all the same c9 is a very good move, because it prevents B c10, wich would attack W top group.
 Now you see, that making territory on the left side isn't a very good idea. 
See also vatiation for w24];B[cm]C[Locally W must play d11 to patch c11 weakness, but then B will extend to k3 or k4, creating a two-wing formation, which is very good. k3 is also a good extension from the q4 stone. So... k3 is the most important point on the board, more urgent, than patching c11. W *must* take it.]
;W[kq]C[Great!];B[iq]C[Good move too. But Black's framework isn't so big. According to the whole board position W can reduse it later, playing around e5, or invade at g3.]
;W[pj]TR[oc][qd][pp][kq]C[Very good move! Now W position is favorable.]
;B[pf];W[qh]TR[np]C[TH: This didn't feel quite right - somehow I felt I should now be
able to secure a lot more territory?

Yes, securing some territory is a good idea. But the problem is that the right side is not the territory yet. It's just moyo - part of the board, which *can* become a territory, but still could be invaded. It's better for W to play o4, which protects o3 weakness, gives W a good territory on the bottom. o4 is a shimary too, so it makes q10 work better (and makes the possible invasion on the right side harder for B)]

Look at L16 stones and ask yourself:
- do they cut black stones? (no)
- are they important for killing/living? (no)
- are they important for W shape (no!)
- do they make thikness or territory? 
(no!!!)

So this stones is absolutely useless! (Just a mere few points) Trying to save them you just create a heavy weak group, wich can become the ideal target for B attack! Imagine B plays n14 (see variation for a possible continuation)This is the shortest way to defeat :(
So you *must* sacrifice them, while they are small! 
Or you can play from your alive stones (n14 for example), threatening to save L16. But B can ignore it and play elswhere.]

C[Locally J15 is better for B, but in general they must make something with their weak stones on the right (p6 for example).]

(;W[go]C[TH: Here I wanted to start reducing the black corner while
building outside strength, but this didn't seem to work too well.
Was I too worried about black's corner? I felt I should do
something now to keep the initiative.



Well, in general after invading opponent's moyo (framework), your stones will be attacked (the deeper the invasion, the harder the  attack will be), and while they runs away, the attacking side (but not invading) gains outside strength! 

Let's count the points now. 
W has:
- 30 solid points on the top right
- 24 points moyo on the bottom (yes, it's not territory yet! Black can invade it easily, starting from r3 or n3)
- 6,5 points komi
-and the relatively weak group on the left.
So around 60 points, if W manages to protect the bottom

B has:
- 15-20 points on the top
- 20-25 ponts of solis territory on the left 
- very good moyo on the lower-left quorter of the board 
- and very, very!, VERY!!! weak  r6r9 group on the right (it's so weak due to W s4, q4 and q10 stones). 

The outcome of the game mainly depends on the result of W attack on the q6q19 group! In general, W has two ways:

1) try to destroy B base and attack hardly (or even kill), starting from s7
2) close B inside, gaining great outside strength, wich will be very useful in reducing B moyo
See some variations below (from move 51)

The general idea in a such positions is that you must gain thickness first (attacking weak stones). Then your invasion will be much more successful]
;B[io]C[The right answer.];W[gm];B[fn];W[gn]C[Black can play g3 and after W connects, invade the right side (see some possible variations )]
