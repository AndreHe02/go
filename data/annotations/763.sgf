;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[jp]LB[pj:a][de:b][fq:c]C[It cannot be said that this is wrong but it is a little unusual.  'a', 'b' and 'c' are all more common.]
;W[qj];B[de];W[cg];B[ec]LB[ef:a][cc:b]C[This is not joseki. 'a' and 'b' are joseki moves.  In this position 'a' is probably best so as to work with the 3 star points B has played.]
;W[dd];B[ed];W[ce];B[ee];W[cf]C[This is just to big for W.  One cannot W giving the opponent corners this big unless one gets overwhelming influence.  In this sequence W8 give W just at much thickness as B has.  In fact, it is entirely pssibly that the B wall may come under attack.]
;B[kd]LB[jd:a]C[Too far. 'a' is the correct point - the proverb says to stand 3, extend 4.]
;W[qm]LB[qg:a][dn:b]C[This does not seem like an urgent move.  W can play at either 16 or 'a' and should not decide which until it is necessary. 'b' is a nice point to play]
;B[cn]LB[fq:a]C[Wrong side.  B has nowhere to go on the left side because of the strong position of W8. 'a' would be better.]
;W[gq];B[ck];W[qq]LB[rp:a]C['a' is the joseki move.  In this case it would be very attractive because the natural B answer it to palay at 3-3, but here that is not appealing because the lower side is open.]

(;B[pq]LB[qp:a]C[Letting W connect to the two stones on the side is not appealing, especially at b's lower side is undercut by W18.  Follow the varation at 'a']
;W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[qf]LB[pi:a][go:b][eh:c]C[W is never goign to play here as to do so would leave the right too low. So why should B?  B needs to try to make something of his thickness.  'a', 'b' and 'c' are all points which spring to might, although each takes some reading to see the possibilities before playing..]
;W[kc]LB[pn:a]C[This is a funny move.  It bears no relationship to any other W stone on the board.  Turning at 'a' to counter B's thickness looks best.]
;B[jc]C[Wrong side.  Pushing W into the B wall anad trying to secure the top right is a more attractive option.]
;W[lc];B[jd];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[ob]LB[nf:a]C[B could also consider playing 'a' to force W to make a small live on the side.]
;W[mf];B[cp]LB[bp:a]C[After b17 and 19 the joseki move is at 'a', but this is not attractive with the large W keima.  B would like to preserve the option to invade at the 3-3 point.  However,  B has four groups on the board which do not see mt orelate to one another well.  This is a sure sign that B is behind.]
;W[cq];B[do]LB[bq:a]C['a' is usually better.];W[bp]
(;B[dq]LB[ep:a][bo:b]C[B has to play 'a' or 'b'.  The prospects of winning the ko do not look good, so it seems that 'a' is the only choice.   See variation.]
;W[co]LB[ep:a]C[Better to extend at 'a'];B[ep];W[cp];B[eo];W[eq]
LB[er:a]C[has to be at 'a' to connect all the stones together.]
;B[fq];W[dr];B[fr]LB[fp:a][dn:b][gp:c][hp:d]C[With cutting points at 'a' and 'b' this is a little unreasonable.  Bc, W47, Bd looks better.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[hq];W[fn];B[dn]LB[em:a]C['a' is better shape,  letting W cut of the one stone at 17 is nothing to worry about.]
;W[em];B[dl]LB[ek:a]C[Unless B 'a' works instead of this move B is in trouble.  If W plays 55 in response to 'a' is can get very complicated.]
;W[fk]C[B's prospects of catchingthis group now do not look good.]
;B[ej];W[mp]LB[pn:a]C[This is uncalled for.  In the first place, 'a' is the point to play in this quarter ofthe board.  But more importantly, W must stabilize his 5 stones to the left befor ecreating another weak group.  Given that the 5 stones at the top are still weak, w is now in trouble]
;B[lo]C[wrong direction.  this hands the initiative back to W.  This move forces W to attack the three B stones to the right.  b should be using those stones to chase the lone W stone in order to start a splitting attack.]
;W[mo];B[mn];W[nn];B[no];W[oo];B[np]C[B's moves at 59 and 61 have got him into trouble.  The situation would have been reversed had B59 been at 63]
;W[op];B[nq];W[oq];B[on];W[or];B[pr];W[nr];B[mq];W[pn];B[om]
LB[mr:a]C[Capturing is better. At least B can then play 'a' in sente]
;W[mr];B[lq];W[fj];B[el];W[fl];B[qr];W[rr];B[lr]LB[ei:a]C[This is a meaningless yose move.  The battle is in the center.  B should be aiming at a spliting attack on the two weak W groups, athough this will be difficult at his own stones on the left are still now very strong. 'a' is almost mandactory.]
;W[ei];B[pm];W[qn];B[pk]C[The B group on the side is the urgent issue now.  B should not have let W get to play 84]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[pi];B[qi]LB[nm:a]C[B's moves are very heavy.  They do not achieve anything and filling in B's own liberties makes a W move at 'a' a severe threat for the future.]
;W[qh];B[oi]LB[ri:a]C[If B is not going to sacrifice a second stone at 'a' there is little point in cutting.]
;W[ph];B[oh];W[kb]LB[lg:a][nm:b]C[There is no rush to play this.  'a' is more appealing.  B has played a lot of heavy moves one the right and a playt at 'a' would aim at pulling out at 'b']
;B[jb];W[mb];B[gm]LB[ld:a][md:b][nb:c][of:d][pg:e]C['a' is a severe threat against the W group, athough at this stage  Wb, Bc, Wd is adequate.  If B can arrange to play 'e' in sente he can play this sequence.]
;W[fm];B[ho]LB[il:a]C[If B is aiming to take territory in thee center this is not enough.  A move like 'a' loks more promising.]
;W[hn];B[in];W[hm];B[im];W[hl];B[il];W[ik];B[jk];W[bj]C[B has got his center territroy, but at what expense?v  W has gained at least as much, even if the B group on the side lives,]
