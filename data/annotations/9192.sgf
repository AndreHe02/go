;B[pp]C[Hi, I am Dieter, 2 dan in Belgium.

I will start with answering your concrete question "Why did I lose by 8 points  while I was ahead".

A first and obvious answer is the small blunder near the end where you lose 4 stones and hence about 10 points.

But a better answer is that you were probably not quite as ahead as you thought. In fact, throughout the game, neither player had a sizeable advantage, at least not one that at our level will convert to a comfortable win in the end.

So let's make this an exercise in counting while I will of course also highlight key moves (good and bad).]
;W[cd];B[pd];W[nc];B[dp];W[fq];B[ip];W[ne]LB[qf:A]C[The opening is not very important at our level, in the sense that victory or loss never are decided here. One has to play sensible moves while distributing the stones.

Here White doesn't make the best choice: he should pressure your stone by taking away its base for potential at A]
;B[pf]LB[dp:A]C[So you are not punished for playing elsewhere (at A) and your opening is better now.]
;W[ng];B[ph]C[Walking along the fourth line is comfortable. White will have to prove his influence is superior, which is not easy.

But again, victory or loss are not decided here.];W[cn]
(;B[fp]C[You could also press the stronger stone, that is easier.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[eq];B[dq];W[go];B[gn];W[iq]C[This move is unknown to me but it makes kind of sense to reinforce here before cutting. It looks like a trick move.

I've worked out a few variations but I am not very satisfied with any of the results. (I'll think about this position some more, it's not crucial for your game).]

(;B[hq]C[I think that this is too much.];W[gq];B[hp];W[ep];B[eo]
;W[do];B[dn];W[co];B[ho];W[fn];B[en];W[fm];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl]
;W[dr];B[cl];W[gm];B[hn];W[cr]C[This is a lost move by White]
;B[gr];W[fr];B[fs]C[Very good];W[er];B[ch]LB[ci:A]C[In the end you don't get out too badly, although I would have extended to A only.]
;W[cj]C[White seems to think so too but this is very aggressive.]
;B[bj];W[bi];B[ci];W[bk];B[dj];W[aj];B[bl]C[Very good.];W[bh]
;B[cg];W[ck];B[dk]C[At this point your influence dominates the board. White has a small corner and a small living group.]
;W[fc];B[hl]LB[gd:B][kd:E][md:C][nd:D][ni:A]C[Your influence is so big that there is no hurry to attack these stones. You can play on a wider scale.

Think about A (build), B (reduce), or C-D-E (attack)];W[fk]
C[White should not try to move out these stones.]
(;B[gk];W[hm];B[im];W[gj];B[fl]C[You capture the cutting stones but your influence is now reduced.]
;W[hj];B[fj]LB[fi:A]C[Again, there is no hurry to capture this stone. If White now plays A your influence is almost gone in this area.]
;W[qn]C[White grabs the initiative to play the largest open area. I'd say you're back to even now.]
;B[ql];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[ps];W[qr]
(;B[oq]C[You can take more advandage of White's weird play.]
;W[hr];B[ir];W[gs];B[jq];W[pj];B[qj];W[pl];B[pk];W[ok];B[qk]
;W[oj];B[pm];W[ol];B[rp]LB[qm:A]C[Good point, but maybe too early. It is better to reinforce at A first.]
;W[qp];B[rn];W[ro];B[so];W[qo];B[rm];W[qm]
(;B[rl]LB[pm:A]C[This is not necessary and anyhow you have no attack going on if that cutting stone is captured.]
;W[oo];B[po];W[pn];B[on]C[This looks like a blitz move];W[nn]
;B[no];W[om];B[mo]C[Now White is very thick and has sente.]

(;W[qc]C[White is a very envious player. See variation];B[pc]
;W[pb];B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[md];W[nd];B[hc]C[Good.];W[jc]
;B[he];W[je];B[hg];W[fe];B[jb];W[ib];B[ic];W[kb];B[jd];W[kc]
;B[kd];W[hb];B[lc];W[lb]
(;B[ie]C[This is a slow move. See var.];W[fi];B[ej];W[mc];B[ld]
;W[jj];B[jf]C[This is also timid.];W[ln]C[White is now building in what used to be Black's area of infuence, further reducing your territory.]
;B[mn];W[mm];B[lo];W[kn];B[ko];W[kl];B[bg];W[ah];B[al];W[ak]
;B[cc]C[VERY GOOD!

This shows very good thinking, hurting White in his softest spot, using your influence close by.]
;W[bc];B[dd];W[ce];B[bb];W[dc];B[cb];W[db];B[bd];W[be];B[ac]
C[A good result. White's outward strength is of no use now that the centre is becoming neutral  while you take a corner.]
;W[ae];B[ad];W[pi];B[qi];W[oh];B[pg];W[kg];B[kf];W[lg];B[jh]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[ki]C[With this move all groups are safe and all territories defined.

Let's count.

I'll give you my count at the next move.];B[ao]C[White
Bottom left - 18
Top - 24
Left - 2
Centre + BR - 18
plus prisoners = 64

Black
Top Left - 3
Top - 3
Centre+bottom - 30
Right - 16

plus 4 prisoners = 56

So at this point Black is already 8 points behind in my opinion. But Black is safe all over the board, while White has some loose stones. So it is probably even overall.]
;W[bo];B[ap]C[Good!];W[an];B[bn];W[bm];B[am];W[bp];B[bn];W[bq]
;B[an];W[rd]C[This was the other big endgame move. You could have taken it before launching the sequence at the bottom left or leave the ko there.]
;B[re];W[sc];B[se];W[rq];B[kh];W[lh];B[ef];W[de];B[gi]C[Nice combination!]
;W[hi];B[gh];W[hh];B[ig];W[gg];B[fh];W[fg];B[eh];W[eg];B[df]
;W[dg];B[cf];W[ge]C[Here's the vicious move! After this, Black must add a stone or one of the two chains will be lost.]
;B[gc];W[gb];B[gd];W[fd];B[da];W[eb];B[jk];W[kk];B[ij];W[ii]
;B[ik];W[ji];B[jn];W[dh]C[Disaster!];B[di];W[ei]C[So this is unfortunately where you effectively lose the game.

Conclusion:

You came out with good influence but played too small scale after that, allowing White to come back. The attack in the bottom right was a good idea but due to a blitzlike move White became very thick as a result.

In the late middle game you played a few slow moves at the top, allowing White to make territory in the centre. However, a good combination in the top left brought you almost level.

In the end not seeing a vicious cut cost you the game.

Good moves to remember: 41 - 53 - 117 - 151
Some places to get new ideas: 59 - 77 -91 - 99 - 133

In case of questions, don't hesitate to come back.
