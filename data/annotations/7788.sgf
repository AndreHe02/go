C[Hello, I have a couple questions about the game.

1 - I seemed to fall behind very quickly in the opening, and found myself fighting an uphill battle most of the game. I'm not quite sure why this happened.

2 - a couple of the exchanges in the game were difficult for me to evaluate, and so I'm not sure whether I lost or gained ground with them

Thanks for the review in advance.];B[pd];W[cc];B[pp];W[cp];B[eq]
;W[hp];B[cq];W[bq];B[dp];W[co];B[cr];W[dm]TR[br]SQ[hp]C[So far so good. This joseki is now complete, but as white, I would be looking forward to playing triangle in sente in some situation. But not yet as white might want to force from the side of the square stone.]
;B[ed]LB[de:A]C[This move does not exist, as black has no response to D15. The normal move with this direction is one space to the right, at F16.]
(;W[cf]C[... But forcing white into submission like this is nice.]
;B[ic];W[nq];B[pn];W[kp]LB[hr:A]C[White is trying to make territory where there is none, as you can slide to A, which is what I would do right now, because G3 is W sente.]
(;B[qk]C[Strange shape, R10 is better.];W[nc]C[The B possition on the left is a bit weak, so this is a good approach. Except I would play G3 first.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[kc]
(;B[jd]LB[je:A]C[I'm thinking that this move of mine was questionable, but I wanted to put some pressure on the white group; I don't think the resulting exchange favored me too much.

Pressing on the group is allright - no to kill it but to further overconcentrate it. Except the rightshape is keima.]
(;W[gd]C[This W strategy is pretty bad, I don't see what he is trying to achieve. You can now strenghten yourself by attacking the top group, then attack this stone.]
;B[gc]C[It's true that this connection is usually good, but here it helps white, or would help, if he knew what he was doing.]
(;W[hc]C[This cannot be good];B[hd];W[fc];B[hb];W[fd];B[fb]
;W[ec]LB[lb:A][mb:B]C[To attack from inside is a good approach here. A looks good, but actually it's not so. B is better.]

(;B[hr]C[White's group below was looking a little thin, so I wanted to probe his weakness and see what I could do. I was thinking that I could aim for M3 after playing this move

The white group might have some weak spots, but feels strong overall. This move he can respond by j3 (after the obligatory atari at f5) and you have no attack at all. So imo this approach is unappropriate at this moment.]

;W[hq];B[jr];W[gr];B[is];W[gs]C[I lost the black group on the left hand side, but I'm not sure how bad this exchange was for me. In terms of pure territory, I felt like I came out ahead, but his influence on the left hand side was enormous.

The exchange is very bad, since white can still live on sansan.]
;B[es];W[bs];B[do]TR[go]C[an ill conceived attempt on my part to save the group.

Prolly cant save it, but i'ts good to exploit the weekness white has at triangle to your advantage.]

;W[mn];B[mm];W[on];B[om];W[nn];B[nm]C[This sequence was probably a mistake, but I was thinking to make a thick wall to attack white's weak group in the upper right, and then come back later to patch my weakness on the lower side.

The lower side is hopeless, imo you can't save it by one move. On the other had, the top w group should die now, so good job.]
;W[in];B[im];W[jm];B[jl];W[hm];B[km];W[hn];B[me]C[I think this peep is premature, although it's more in the general sense. By peeping too much you induce weekneses in your position on the other side. I would play N13 right away and keep this for when its needed.]

;W[oi];B[qj];W[ok];B[nj];W[pk]C[Nothing to worry about on the right side, you can just close the left, or even tenuki maybe :)]

This is nothing more than a 13 points endgame gote.];W[kf];B[ke]
;W[kg];B[mh];W[lg];B[mh];W[hg];B[cg]C[the way things stand, white will probably win this game, and it seemed like my only chance was to either keep my attack on the weak group going, or establish myself along his side...this was my best idea for doing that.

You are right that white is ahead now. The central group cannot be really attacked, so you can only hope for a miracle.]

The game was ok and you were leading most of the time, going for a winning kill, but then you let him slip away and lost in the instant. So except some inferior things the main point of the game is only how you let the group live in those few moves.]
