C[Reviewed for black by Jarkko Lindblad (JL), IGS 2d*

I hope this is of any help.];B[qd]C[teruya [4k\]: hi

C[JL: proper direction. Black has a nice framework now.];W[oe]
LB[fq:A]C[This move seems to come to early, as B doesn't have a developped framework on the right side yet. How to take profit from it?

JL: well, white could have played elsewhere ('A' or so), but then black could have made this moyo more solid or even larger. Nothing wrong with the white move. I would probably had played it too 90% of the time.]

(;B[nd]MA[oq][nq][mq][pp][po][pn][qn]C[JL: I am not sure this is the right direction. Easy for while to settle himself lightly now and after that is is questionable if black can use his marked thickness. Also black can't expect to make much territory from the top cause the skirt is open.]
;W[hc];B[qh]MA[nd]LB[pf:A]C[Better on the fourth line?

JL: you are playing lots of moves in one small area. Still hard to say what is the best local move. The marked stone was clearly wrong direction. 4th line would probably be better, at least more consistent with the thickness you have built. Simple keima of 'A' would have made it just about impossible for white to mobilize the lone stone - also it would have been further away from the thickness - remember to play away from thickness, no matter who's it is.]
;W[jp];B[jm]MA[qh]LB[no:A][km:B][lo:C]C[A bad move, due to the weakness at A?

JL: Hard to tell if it is a good or bad move, but interesting it is anyhow and that alone makes a move worth playing. The weakness at A is not that important as you have lots of liberties and the marked stone. Had you played at 'B', you would have had a better follow-up move of 'C' - now the gap is harder to close. So intead of this, either B or one line below it is better. In general, you should try to think a follow-up to all your moves - the move you played doesn't really have one.]
;W[no]C[JL: this is clearly too deep.];B[mo]SQ[mq][nq][oq]MA[jm]
LB[ko:A]C[JL: this is a bit direct. maybe attacking in a larger scale instead of being obsessed with covering the cutting point. you're strong here, you should attack, not defend. The position of the marked (X) stone is a bit problematic though - it should be one line closer to the other black troops. You could have considered a move like 'A' to lean on the opponent's stone. Remember that you can sacrifice the thee stones marked with a square in order to build a wall above them.]
;W[kn];B[km];W[ln]
(;B[mn]C[JL: black is now 'pushing from behind' from two directions, forcing white to destroy his moyo. See the alternative.]
;W[lm];B[nl]MA[km][jm]C[JL: now the marked stones are separated and white is happy. You are also playing in too small scale - your investement on this side is remarkable, yet you will only get relatively little cash and probably no outside thickness.]
;W[lk]C[This seems to be a bad development for B.

JL: black sure seems overconcentrated, though this white move may be an overplay (or not) as things can get difficult if black cuts here at some point. Anyhow, lot of black moves have been played in this corner and for almost no points; white's much more efficient.]
;B[jn];W[lp];B[jo];W[kp]MA[mo][jo]C[JL: peeping a bamboo joint is not a good idea, and you've done it twice here :-)]
;B[ip];W[mp];B[nn];W[np];B[op]LB[ho:A][mj:B]C[JL: not sure if saving these stones is worth giving up sente. I think instead you should have played 'A' and prepare to attack the white hoshi stone from the other direction or somethign like that. Also 'B' looks big.]
;W[qe];B[rd];W[oh];B[oi]LB[pj:A]C[JL: you should not touch what you're attacking in the normal principle. Maybe 'A' better?]
;W[ni];B[pi];W[nj];B[ok]MA[sh][si][rh][sk][sj][qm][qk][rl][rk]
[rj][ri][qi][qj][pk][pl][pm]C[JL: about 16 points here with no possibility of further developement and a zillion stones played here this early. Can't be good - you ended up being on the defensive in your own sphere of influence.]
;W[dm]C[JL: White is leaving himself a bit thin in the center though can't really critizise this move.]
;B[ck]MA[ip][jo][jn][jm][km]C[JL: the marked stones need to be settled first - I am sure they will come under attack later. You have now created yourself a second weak group.]
;W[ci];B[ek];W[fm];B[di];W[ch];B[bm]CR[di][ek]MA[jm][km][jn]
[jo][ip]LB[cm:A]C[JL: I don't really like this move - I don't think you can live 'on the spot' with this move which makes it more an endgame move - what you should think is how to live here or escape - if you escape, it is likely that the marked stones('X') will become weaker, so you should probably try to live here sacrifising something. Maybe 'A'  or so - had you not played the stones marked with a circle, you could have switched to the corner instead.]
;W[bo];B[iq]C[JL: this move is greedy - the hanging connection would make a better shape - after all, this group needs to make eyes too soon. Anyhow, hard to play with two weak groups.]
;W[ho];B[io];W[he]LB[kj:A]C[JL: I think white should have improved the security of his dragon while attacking the weak black string of stones in the center by playing 'A'  or something like that.]
;B[jc]MA[km][jm][jn][jo][io][ip][iq][bm][ck][ek][di][he]LB[ib:A]
C[JL: not only is this move locally bad idea, but also wrong direction. Locally this is very heavy - white has sente and can reduce the side quite a bit starting with 'A'. However the marked white stone attacks all the marked black stones - you should srtenghten one of the two weak groups.]
;W[jf];B[eq];W[gq];B[gp];W[fp];B[fq];W[hp];B[gr];W[go]C[JL: black has a couple of alternatives here.]

(;B[hq]C[JL: this is probably the best move.];W[dr];B[dq];W[cq]

(;B[ep];W[eo]LB[cp:A][fr:B]C[I feared that W might play B if I cut at A but perhaps this would be better.

JL: I think you played it right.];B[gp];W[do];B[fo];W[fn];B[eg]
LB[fi:A][gj:B][gk:C]C[JL: this move is so thin. At some point white will cut somethign off I am sure. And even if not, it is hard to make eyes from that direction which is filled with opponens stones. Also you are creating a rather one dimensional group, not eyes whatsoever - 'A', 'B' and 'C' all better.]

(;W[dj]C[JL: the alternative is better.];B[ej]
(;W[cj];B[ee];W[dd];B[dk]C[JL: black is still heavy, but luckily white is a bit thin.]
;W[ff];B[ef]C[JL: you can't make all these connections - your dragon is about to die, it needs eyes.]
;W[fi];B[ei];W[fh]C[JL: white's going for kill...];B[dg]LB[eh:A]
C[JL: not sure if this is better than 'A' which would take a liberty from the two stones helping escaping]
;W[gk];B[fg];W[gg];B[bj]LB[bk:A]C[JL: 'A' better as it is sente too and doesn't help white as much.]
;W[bi];B[gf];W[hg];B[ge];W[fd];B[fe]C[JL: happy to make this eye - white's previous move was aji keshi.]
;W[bk];B[bl];W[aj];B[hf];W[if];B[hd];W[cl]MA[bm]C[JL: the keima I citicized earlier doesn't seem to be any good now, does it? (marked stone)]
;B[jk]LB[nh:A]C[JL: anything deeped would be risky, but maybe first black should reduce from the side his own territory is still open? Something to force white to protect against 'A'.]
;W[mg];B[gc]
(;W[fc];B[gb];W[rn]C[JL: hane like this is a very big endgame move.]
