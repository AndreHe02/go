C[RickMott:  Hi, I'll be doing this review for Black (Ming).
My comments will be marked with RM: at the beginning.

In general, you need to focus a little more on making your moyos solid, which means alternating between 3rd and 4th line.  12 of the first 14 moves in this game were played on the 4th line or higher!

I made many local tactical suggestions; the best thing you can do is develop your reading skills by solving simple tesuji and life-and-death problems.  It will strengthen your grasp of cutting and connecting, which is a little weak still.
 
Good luck!];B[pp];W[pd]C[ninjaboy [16k\]: hi];B[dp]C[fw280 [16k\]: hi, gg!]
;W[dd];B[jd]C[RM: If you're going to split White, better to do it on the 3rd line.  It's easier to make a base after White approaches you from one side or the other.]
;W[cn]C[ninjaboy [16k\]: im not really 16k ... think im weaker.. so be gentle ^^ haha
fw280 [16k\]: sure ^^];B[co];W[dn];B[fo]C[RM: Better to extend along 4th line.  This may make some weakness for you later.]
;W[dj];B[gd]C[RM:  2-space extension is good on 3rd line, but not 4th.  It doesn't make a base, and doesn't threaten to come in to White's corner.  F17 would be better.]
;W[pj];B[pf];W[md]C[RM:  Very odd game; 14 moves and only 2 stones on or below the 3rd line on the entire board!   Nobody wants territory these days... :)]
;B[kp];W[qn]C[RM:  Compare the results of this to what you eventually get in the upper right.  This is just like F17 that I was recommending to you earlier.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[qd];W[qc];B[pe];W[qe]C[RM:  Playable, I guess, but a simple connection would be better for White.]
(;B[qf]C[RM:  You don't get much from this; why not consider separating White with atari at P6?  See variation.]
;W[rd];B[nf];W[mf]C[RM: White gets to push you around because you have no easy way to make a base for these stones down the right side.]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[qh];W[ri];B[rh];W[oi];B[ph];W[nh];B[ih]C[RM: Risky to tenuki.  Your group is nearly enclosed and may not have two eyes yet.]
;W[ij]C[RM: But White follows you, so it works out.  Not sure what this move does for White, though.]
;B[fi];W[dh];B[fg]C[RM: Your stones are starting to link up, but you're giving away too much to White on the left and upper left corner.  I might even think about a 3-3 invasion at C17 now, or at least a splitting move at D14.]
;W[df];B[ec]C[RM: Good move; might have done this instead of F13.]
;W[dc];B[ed]C[RM: Overconcentrated.  You don't need this.  If you want to be really safe, just descend to E18 (threatening to come into the corner).  Then you get M17 on the other side, and a nice bit of territory at the top.]
;W[kd]C[RM:  This way, White restricts your territory and grows his.]
;B[kc];W[ld];B[jc];W[lc];B[ne];W[nd]C[RM: You're forcing White to reinforce his territory without making any yourself.  If you needed these moves to live, you should have done them earlier; if you don't, don't make them now.

Look around the board for the big areas.  Your bottom is very weak; the game will hinge on whether you can make enough there to compensate for White's left side and upper left.  You must reinforce the bottom.]
;B[re]C[RM:  Much too small.  White should ignore you and invade the bottom.]
;W[se]C[RM:  But he's 16k too, so...];B[qd]C[ninjaboy [16k\]: hmm this will be difficult.]
;W[rc];B[rg];W[sf]C[RM:  Now you have to work a bit to live.  See variation.]
(;B[sg];W[og];B[od];W[pc];B[rf]
(;W[sd]C[RM:  White misses a chance to kill you.  See variation.]

ninjaboy [16k\]: lol];B[oe];W[mb]C[ninjaboy [16k\]: i had a similar shape last game... didn't know how to break out hmm

RM:  O13 first. See variation.]
(;B[pg];W[ng]C[RM: Now you're dead.];B[rj];W[qj];B[si];W[rk]
;B[sk];W[sj];B[pb];W[na];B[rj]C[ninjaboy [16k\]: two kos to kill?

RM: No.  White should just extend down to S8.  You're toast.  White doesn't have to play ko.]
;W[sl]C[fw280 [16k\]: I am not sure what happne now
ninjaboy [16k\]: hmm
fw280 [16k\]: happen
ninjaboy [16k\]: probably dead
ninjaboy [16k\]: let me see.

RM:  Mistake for White.  If he extends to S8 instead, there's no problem for him.]
;B[rl]C[RM: Useless.  White just captures 2 stones.];W[sj];B[sm]
;W[qb]C[RM: White should just connect at T9.];B[pk]C[ninjaboy [16k\]: i think ur last move unneccessary?
ninjaboy [16k\]: the stone's prettty dead already
ninjaboy [16k\]: reduced territory by one
fw280 [16k\]: yes];W[sn];B[ro];W[rn];B[om]C[RM: All your moves in this area are just gifts to White.  Very hard for Black to win now.  You must defend the bottom.]
;W[on];B[no]C[RM;  Good choice!  You can at least build strength at the bottom while putting some pressure on the string of white stones.

Strategically, you are in big trouble.  White's capture in the upper left is at least 70 points; the left side looks like another 35.  Where are you going to find 105 points of secure territory?

White can play conservatively, just reduce your areas without taking any risks, and win easily.]
;W[nn];B[ln]C[RM: Too aggressive; you're not strong enough.  Extension to N5 is better.]
(;W[mm]C[RM: But White lets you get away with it.  Let's see what happens if he doesn't (see variation).]
;B[lm];W[mk];B[ll];W[ml];B[lk];W[fj]
(;B[gl]C[RM: Let's estimate the territories.  If you can defend the whole bottom on the 4th line, you have 39 points there.  (You can't -- if white gets T5 he can reduce your bottom by 8 points.)

The center area you've sketched out with this move is around 20 more points, in round numbers.

The top looks like 25 or so, for a total of 45+39=84.

Meanwhile, White has nearly 80 rock-solid points in the upper right alone, plus whatever he gets on the left side.  So you're down by 30 points, minimum.  To have any chance, you can't just sketch out your own territory -- you have to attack, somehow.  See variation for one possibility.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[em];B[fk];W[el];B[gk];W[ek];B[gn]C[RM: Don't worry about the G7 cut, it's a ladder for you if you just connect at F6.]
;W[il];B[lj];W[kf];B[gj];W[ej]
(;B[gi]C[RM: You don't need this connection; it's more important to capture white's stones.  Complete your net with some move like L12 immediately.

If White cuts, why do you care?  Just connect at F12 and capture on a larger scale.]
;W[ji];B[kh]C[RM: You're not strong enough to hold this line.]
;W[jh];B[jg];W[ig];B[hh];W[kg];B[jf];W[ki];B[li];W[lh]C[RM: See what I mean?]
;B[hf]C[RM: A net is good shape, but you don't need it.  Just connect at K15 and capture on a larger scale.]
;W[mi]C[ninjaboy [16k\]: hmm last move was gote i think];B[ik]
;W[jk];B[hk];W[jj]C[RM: Mistake by White.  K7 pokes deeper into your territory.  You can cut.]
;B[im]C[RM: No, just cut right away at K8.];W[jl];B[jm]C[ninjaboy [16k\]: lol beautifully done... i must learn from this...]
;W[oo];B[np];W[op];B[oq];W[mn];B[lo];W[mo];B[mp];W[so]C[RM: Yes, this is big.  You'll be forced all the way to the bottom edge, in sente for White.]
;B[rq];W[rp];B[qp];W[sp];B[qq];W[sq];B[bn];W[bm];B[bo];W[mq]
;B[nr]C[RM: Ouch!  Why be fancy?  Just connect at O3.  You'll win the capturing race.]

(;B[ir]C[RM: No, just extend.  You'll win the fight.  See variation.]
;W[iq];B[js];W[jq];B[gq]C[RM: This is bad; white can live.  See variation.  You should extend at H2.]
(;W[lr]C[RM: White ataris on the wrong side.  See variation for what happens if he ataris at H2 first.]
;B[hp];W[ks];B[hr]C[RM: Amazing.  You get to play it anyway.  White should have played here instead of capturing.]

(;B[gp];W[gr]C[ninjaboy [16k\]: ahhh i thought i had to do it but i didn't

RM: Yes, major blunder.  I've stopped commenting at this point; the game is clearly over.

Besides, even if you capture this group, you're still 30 points behind.  Undo this mistake and do "score estimate".  You'll see White is still way ahead.]
