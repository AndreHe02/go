AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hello! My name is Simon, thanks for submitting your game for review.

I've included comments as I go through the game, along with a few variations, and some general comments at move 1.  I've tried to limit the number of variations I put in (as this can confuse rather than clarify) - however, if you want me to expand upon anything please feel free to ask me.

I think both players have a good grasp of where to play and where the big points are on the board.  Ultimately, the flow of the game was dictated by small errors and mistakes, mistakes which come to pass with experience.  To both players I would recommend studying some basic joseki, and some general go problems, as these help to inform this experience (see links below)

I hope my comments are of use - however, if you wish to contact me with any questions, please email me at duder@hotmail.co.uk

Happy go playing :)

Simon];W[dc]C[All in all not a bad game.  A fair few mistakes, but the general flow of play was good.  I would say that the reason black lost the game came down to a few mistakes - or overplays.  I would have liked to have seen black play in a more restrained kind of way, to keep control of the game and the advantage that he starts with.

Below I've summarised black's most costly mistakes of the game.  Note that these mistakes are not the worst ones, but the ones that led to the greatest loss of points (white made some pretty bad errors but got away with most of them)

Move 4: what should have been an even result in the corner, this move causes white to gain control of the upper left corner

Move 10: This overstretching later causes black to lose even more stones and territory later on in the game

Move 20: White makes a horrible error in move 19 - if black had played correctly here, he could have easily taken control of the game

Move 84: I think both players realised the cost of this mistake of the game - this is unfortunate, it may have been a very different game otherwise]
;B[ce];W[cd]
(;B[cj]TR[ce]LB[de:a]C[Standard response is at A (see variation) - C15 will come under pressure, so white is bound to take an early lead here]
(;W[cg]LB[de:a]C[A better move for white would be at A (see variation)]
;B[fc]TR[cg]LB[de:a]C[Again, A is the crucial move here to prevent white linking up with the marked stone.]
;W[be]LB[de:a]C[This is a steady move linking up with C13.  Perhaps a little too passive - A would be better in my opinion, but the fighting is complicated so I've left out any variations]
;B[de]C[Blacks only move];W[ed]C[This is a critical situation for black - he has been divided into two weak groups.  White is still unsettled making it a complicated situation - I've included one potential line of play for black]
(;B[jc]TR[fc]LB[hc:a]C[Aside from neglecting the two black stones, this extension is too far - F17 is looking very vulnerable and is asking for white to jump in at H17 (which I think is what happens later)]
;W[ee]C[Correct move];B[bf]C[This is too late from black];W[bg]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[ae];W[dg]TR[cj][fc][jc]LB[cm:a][cl:b]C[Despite the loss in the corner, the game looks pretty even here.  However, white has built up a lot of thickness - if I were black I'd be concerned about sorting out the marked stones, in particular C10 - white could easily jump in at A or B to great effect and put C10 on the run]
;B[jq]LB[ej:a]C[White should really take advantage of this and attack C10.  A is a nice followup move from black otherwise]
;W[qo]LB[qp:a]C[This is a bad move - R6 or Q6 are far better alternatives.  Black plays A and takes a decisive advantage (see variation)]
(;B[qn]LB[po:a]C[This is a poor response - this is just begging white to play at A and split black into two weak groups]
;W[po]TR[pp][qn]C[Black now has two very weak stones to sort out - white will surely benefit from this]
;B[qp];W[ro]LB[rp:a][rn:b]C[This is passive - A or B are better moves, and put more pressure on black]
;B[ql];W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq];W[om];B[qi]C[Black does well given the circumstances]
(;W[qd]LB[rq:a]C[White would do well to invade the corner and secure his stones which aren't yet secure (see variation)]
;B[qe]SQ[qi][ql][qn]LB[qc:a]C[R17  is also an option, but drives white towards the stones below which aren't yet secure.  If these were stronger R17 would almost certainly be the better move - however in this case black does well to play R15]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[pa]LB[re:a]C[Should play at A first]
(;B[oa]C[Black can get a ko out of this situation (see variation)]

(;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gr]TR[jq]C[The usual move is at G3, but black can play this way as he has K3 in support (otherwise white could cut at G3 and cause all sorts of problems)]

(;B[gp]C[Black does not need to fear the cut (see variation)]
;W[oi];B[ph]

Certainly black's position isn't looking great at this point.  A looks to be a strong move which generates some territory but black's loss in the upper left is too great.  This is the last comment of the game]
