C[I played this game a week or so ago, and had trouble figuring out why I lost, although the result is W +1.5.  I'll post some questions throughout (flagged with "JA"), but all comments are welcome.  Thank you in advance!

• Hello Joshua. I'll be doing my best to give you a clearly explained review of the things you wonder about regarding this game. To make the viewing easier, I'll be giving my comments with the "•" icon infront of it.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[oq]C[JA: This is what I would do as white.

• P3 is a common approach to make. Especially if you don't want to give black the option to choose where he wants to make his possible knight-move (shimari). Looks aggressive but still quite proper.]
;B[po];W[dc]LB[np:1][oq:A]C[• From this position it might be more profitable to start attacking the lone stone at 'A', by playing at '1' before doing anything else. Note that at the end you will end with gote, but all in all it's worth it.]
(;B[ce];W[cg]C[JA: I'm not sure my response here was best, it forces white to make territory, and I'm not sure what I can do with the resulting influence.

• At this point of the game it's always hard to say what's best. As long as you don't self-atari, anything can be taken as good. Your approach here is fine. But let's see how you answered.]
;B[ee];W[gc]LB[fd:1]C[• When black makes the jump there by one space, it's not recommended to play like white just did. It's even regarded as slow because black can take advantage of it by playing at '1'. 

• White should've played at '1' instead of G17.]
(;B[dh];W[ch];B[di];W[ci];B[dj];W[ck];B[cc]LB[dg:A]C[• Jumping in the corner there seems like an overplay. White still has the weakness at 'A', where he can cut black in two. So before jumping to that corner, you should decide for yourself "Do I go for influence, or for territory?" Going for both is simply too greedy and often too impossible to succeed in.

• If you did think about that, then in that case you deemed the corner your priority, but I wonder if you were aware of your weakness at 'A'.]
;W[kq]LB[db:D][ec:C][ic:B][qi:A][fq:E]TR[pc][po][qp]C[JA: White's tenuki here surprised me, and I wonder if black should have taken more of the upper left immediately.

• This tenuki is definitely surprising to see since the situation in the upper left is far from settled. 

• A move around A for rapid progression is also good. Since it supports all the triangle marked stones.
Or at B, to put pressure on the white stones there would've been another move to consider. 
The move at C or D look good and solid, but also a tad slow perhaps compared to the other moves.
E is an aggressive move, but it functions well with the space that it has.]
;B[fq]LB[fn:D][fo:C][cq:A][iq:B]C[JA:  White is building something of a moyo.  Is there a better reduction point?  It seems likely that this approach will be attacked.

• This move is deep and not really for reducing, but more for settling down in white's potential territory. And naturally with intruders, if will always be attacked. You have plenty of room to move around in though. The A to D moves are potential follow-up moves of what you created by placing your stone at F3.]
;W[hq]LB[fo:A]C[• This move is a must for white. And instead of diving into the corner like you did in the next move, jumping towards A looks better.]
(;B[cq]LB[dq:A]C[• Let's see how white ends up then if he blocks the other way, at A.]
(;W[cp]C[JA: I think maybe blocking the other way would be better for white.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[go]SQ[dg]C[JA: I thought this result was acceptable for black, because of the D12 stones, white's influence isn't as enormous as it could be on the left.  Disagreements?

• It's very acceptable, especially if you can leave the situation while keeping sente. Plus the strength the bottom white stones have now are reduced significanlty.
Still, that D12 group of yours and that weakness at D13 troubles me greatly.]
;B[qj]TR[qi]C[• Big point scored here. It makes me proud to be your reviewer, even though my favorite spot is the triangle. I consider that just the right distance between the corner stones.]
;W[jc];B[db];W[qf];B[qd]C[JA: Again, white's tenuki surprised me.  Maybe black should take the upper left immediately with E17?

• You have enough in the upper left to be satisfied with. White's tenuki here is a good choice, paying no heed to his D17 stone and trying to get the other bigger points on the board.

• Defending like you did here looks alright.];W[mc];B[oe]
;W[no];B[oj]LB[dk:A]C[JA:  This move of mine feels good in that it weakens the R14 stone, and gets out into the center, but it also looks slow glancing at the whole board.  Any thoughts are appreciated.

• It does look slow, doesn't it. But you should never distrust a 'feel-good' move. Those are the moves that define you as the player that you are, and make you grow your own style. It's a good move in my opinion. It doesn't only weaken the R14 stone, but enforces the entire right side position. 

• Although, there might be more pressing matters on the board right now. Pressing at 'A' is probably one of the biggest forcing moves available. One white can not ignore. So before you defend, always look for that one move that white just can't ignore & helps your influence in the early stages of the game.]
;W[og];B[me]LB[qh:A]C[JA: I thought this would enable reduction of the top later, while still pressuring the P13 stones.

• Hmm, difficult to comment on. To let someone get out easily like that doesn't seem to go well in any situation. White's stones on the top have enough space to make something solid there. The spot at 'A' looks good yet troublesome for both players, too.]
;W[mg];B[mj]LB[kf:B][kg:A][kh:C]C[JA: Looking back, maybe something like L15 is better?

• N10 is an overconcentrated move. It holds little purpose in this situation and does little to improve your situation. Furthermore you give white momentum to fix his weaknesses. L15 same story really, it's too far away to put real pressure on white's stones.. You could've tried to block white's one space jumps by playing 'A', 'B' or 'C' instead. Forcing him to make a choice in which you can then benefit from by chasing him up some more while other positions of his weaken by the minute.]
;W[pm]C[• A rather bold and daring invasion by white.];B[on]
;W[om];B[nm];W[nl];B[mm];W[ml];B[lm];W[ll];B[ol];W[ok];B[pl]
;W[pk];B[ql];W[nk];B[ri]C[JA:  this leaves a lot of weaknesses, to be sure, but leaves a lot of potential in the corner.

• What you call weaknesses, I call possibilities. Your situation is strong there so there is no need to panic if you lose 1 or 2 stones.]
;W[nj];B[oi]TR[pq]C[JA: Is tenuki to play Q3 possible instead of this?

• Of course. If someone plays at the triangle if you were white, you would feel pressured, too. Even I feel pressured just by looking at it! It is afterall a forcing move and also a point-winning move. No reason not to play it instead of P11.]
;W[ni];B[dk]C[JA:  This encourages white to make more territory on the left, but I didn't see a way to stop that anyway.

• I agree, pushing there is the best you can do. Remember that you made white strong on the left thanks to your invasion there. Everything has a price. :)]
;W[cl];B[em];W[jk];B[ke];W[ld];B[le];W[kg];B[pq];W[ih]LB[ob:H]
[fc:D][re:G][bf:F][hj:C][bp:B][hr:E][or:A]C[• The moves 'A' to 'H' are quite some big forcing moves there. The moment white plays (around) there, makes you lose a lot of points.]
;B[km];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[ar];W[or];B[lp];W[lq];B[mp];W[mq]
;B[np]C[JA:  Instead of O4, maybe black should have blocked at Q2?

• Yes. Letting white dive into your corner like that, was not pretty. Costs you more points than you bargained for.]

;W[fl];B[gl];W[el]LB[dl:A]C[• Click 'A' to see the sequence.]
(;B[cj]C[JA:  I think my reading was right - reduces the C9 liberties, so F8 is capturable.

• I'm afraid it has little relevance. Even if you didn't play C10, then you would either get in white's territory or capture those 2 stones. And white would rather let those stones be captured than you reducing his beloved territory.]

• There are only a few important numbers of forcing moves left for you, in that order. 1 to 3. So yes, ignoring white's move to play another yose move, is the right thing to do.]

• Can't agree more. :)];W[hl];B[ig]C[JA:  Hallucination.]

[gs]C[• I felt as if the game was played very cautiously by black. Perhaps a bit too cautious. Black had some very passive moments throughout the midgame, handing white the opportunity to come back. Your opening was good, the midgame was like walking in the dark, trying to find that light switch. You had plenty of decider moves that were missed, and made some critical mistakes in the yose stage. Otherwise the game would've been a comfortable win for you in all regards.

• As GTL-reviewer I'll be keeping track of the people I reviewed games for, so that I can help them achieve a better assessment of the game in their own style when another review is requested by the same person.

• All in all I hope you liked & learned a few things from this review. If anything is not to your liking or feel the need to discuss further then let me know on KGS, my nickname there is 'Adante'.

Goodluck with your future games!])
(;B[dl];W[fm];B[dm]LB[cm:A]C[• As you can see, this is terrible for black. He has to block at 'A'. And then the stones are yours anyway.]

(;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[em];B[cm]
LB[dg:A][qi:B]TR[cg][ch][ci][ck]C[• This is very opportunistic play. White's triangled group looks not that superb. And with that weakness still there for black at 'A' it can go from heaven to chaos in a heartbeat. It's difficult to predict what comes out of that. But in overall this position, like you thought, looks better for white, but only on the bottom.

• Still, black has a big move available at B. With a lot of potential. So you should never neglect your own potential. And a stronger position on the board for you, means stronger fighting when the game progresses.]
))
(;B[fo];W[eq];B[fr];W[dn];B[fm]LB[cq:A]C[• The weakness/invasion at A remains. And thanks to the jumping sequence you pretty much annilhilated the feared moyo.]
))
(;B[fd];W[fc];B[cc]LB[cb:A][dd:B]C[• Black jumping in the corner, naturally white wants to stop him somehow. See if you can guess for yourself which move seems right to you for white to play now. A or B?]
(;W[cb]C[• This is a normal response for white. And now the shaping of black's base is nearly done.]
;B[dd];W[ec];B[bc]C[• And this last move gives black a comfy base to operate from.]
)
(;W[dd]LB[cd:A][de:B]C[• This would've been my choice. I like complications, often resulting in backfiring positions, but that's where the fun is, right?

• Actually, this move is also considered to be trick play by white. Black has now two options to answer with. Again, A and B.]
(;B[cd]C[• Connecting here might seem safe and sound if you are hungry for the corner, but in exchange you will get cut off from the outside world with a floating group out there. Let me show you.]
;W[de];B[df];W[cf];B[db];W[ec];B[ef];W[di]C[• Now, this might seem like an O.K. result at this moment, but being cut off in the early stages, or in overall, is usually a undeniable loss. Clearly the advantage now is for white when it comes to the fights ahead.]
)
(;B[de];W[cd];B[bd]LB[cb:C][bc:A][be:B]C[• Oh oh oh.. doesn't it look attractive for white to cut? Actually A and B are not at all good moves and gives white more problems than fortune. 

• C, on the other hand, is the correct move to make. Play the options out so that you can get a sense of how it can go.]
(;W[bc];B[cb];W[be];B[ec];W[db];B[eb]C[• A true white's tragedy. Ok, he has the corner, but look what you just did? You end with sente and cut him in two with a strong shaped position.]
)
(;W[be];B[bc];W[bf];B[ec];W[db];B[eb]C[• This is even worse than the other cut. Surely not something you would like to consider playing anytime soon as white.]
)
(;W[cb];B[bc]C[• For black this is acceptable. Even if white leaves the position with sente.]
)))))
(;B[np]C[• With this move you can force white to extend sideways, while you gain a pretty decent amount of influence outside.]
;W[mq];B[lp];W[lr];B[jp];W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[ro];W[pf]C[• I'm not sure how you feel about using influence, but I would be happy to play as black here.]
