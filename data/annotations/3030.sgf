C[Hello, My Name is Dylan, I have been playing for 6 months now and have managed to improve my rank to 17k* IGS/10k*KGS over this period. I am approx 9k in my local club. I make this review with the knowledge i have of the game and hope it will be of use to you.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[ed]C[Dreamrace:  Looks  balanced so far.]
;W[dg];B[fq]C[Dreamrace: An Iteresting style of play, generally asking for trouble making an second approach without a continuationon the first.]
;W[cm];B[cc];W[dd];B[dc];W[bc];B[bb];W[bd];B[ee];W[de];B[ef]
;W[dj];B[eo]C[Meatex: My opening was awfull
Dreamrace: I don't think it is that bad, you have flattened white top left, and you are pushing for control of the centre with e5. A move around K16/L16 is an ugent point to take advantage of the thickness top left or Q10 facing your thicness may be more beneficial. If you are planning for centre control e5 is ok, it serves th purpose of again flattening white. Make plans while there are few stones on the board.]

;W[eh];B[fh];W[eg];B[df];W[cf];B[fg];W[ch]C[Dreamrace: I think i would protect at least one cutting point in the centre. see vars]

(;B[nq]C[Dreamrace: Q10 would work very well facing the wall you've developed]
;W[oc]
(;B[od]C[Meatex: Should of played o16 i think.
Dreamrace: You should definately pincer here @ N17 or M16. These sort of pincers will work well with your overwhealming centre thickness. The shoulder hit of O16 will allow white to live comfortably. I prefer M16.]
;W[nd];B[oe];W[pc]C[Dreamrace: Next move is not the joseki (see var.)]

(;B[ne];W[md];B[qc];W[kd];B[le];W[ld];B[ke];W[id];B[je];W[jd]

(;B[kb]C[Meatex: This move was to protect when i would cut at o17.
Dreamrace: W has enough space for two eyes and cutting o17 does not work. Try not to play moves that depend upon your opponent making mistakes. Better to push w along fourth line and make the best of the centre by playing Q10. W Does not need to respond.(Gote). This was a turning point in the game.]

(;W[kc]C[Dreamrace: W does not need to respond (see var.)];B[jb]
;W[ie];B[nc]C[Meatex: Despite having planned this cut i didn't think it through. May have worked if i had played Q16 prior.
Dreamrace: (see var) J14 is a huge move. better @ H15 for W]

;W[jf];B[jg];W[ig];B[ih];W[if]

(;B[ko]C[Dreamrace: Why attack this stone gaining 2-3 points when K3 is worth 15-20 points.]

(;B[hr]C[Meatex: I think this was my biggest mistake. Or perhaps i should of played G3 to protect.
Dreamrace: Makes no difference, I think it's too late.(see var.)]
;W[qa];B[ra];W[pa];B[rb];W[nf];B[mg];W[og];B[ph];W[el]C[Meatex: When i look at this situation i could of seen it coming but i just didn't.
Dreamrace: It often happens like this and you opponent is certainly not going to tell you, so usually it is up to you to judge what you opponent is trying to achieve and outplay him/her accordingly. Being able to read the situation will improve with time as will your whole board thinking. This was your game to win but white stole it from you by playing at a steady pace and exploiting your groups weaknesses. Good Luck for the Future, and enjoy! ; )]
