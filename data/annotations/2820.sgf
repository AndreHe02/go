C[I'd like to get this game reviewed for a few reasons.  It was rather unique for game I've played...I had massive center influence all the way around the board, and ended up winning by all of .5 points.  There were maybe a few huge mistakes, but overall I thought it was played well and certinaly very interesting.

thanks

Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing the game for you.  I think you got a reasonably good position in exchanging territory for thickness, but didn't play aggressively enough to exploit the thickness.

Since the game was decided by half a point, I've tried to point out some of the big points in the end game.  To this end, you should make a special note of the serious mistakes at Black 251 and White 252.  The threat to capture those second-line stones shows up fairly frequently.]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[cd];W[pp];B[dj];W[qj];B[jp];W[fq]C[rstubble: this looks like a terrible move to me...

Ted: I don't think it's as bad as you seem to, although I'd certainly play on the other side, at C5, if I were White.]

;B[on];W[nq];B[mo];W[qg];B[fc]LB[fc:2][cd:1][dj:3]C[rstubble: in retrospect I don't know that I like this move at all...but it turned out okay I suppose

Ted: The three numbered stones are generally a pretty good formation, although usually 1 and 2 are played first with the intention of playing 3.  2 is also commonly at E17 in such a formation.

In this particular position, however, I think I would have played O17 instead of F17.]

;W[ba];B[jd];W[mc]C[rstubble: so at this point, I've traded away 2 sides and 2 corners for massive thickness in the center.  I liked it, and went for it all...  I didn't REALLY think I could defend it all did I?  well, no, but you've gotta try. =)

Ted: I'm glad you liked it.  :-)  Stronger players would say that giving up territory in exchange for thickness isn't a bad thing, especially in a position like this where you have a number of good ideas.

However, you do have to worry about the weak point at D4, which White might be able to exploit to reduce you.]
;B[me]C[Ted: I'm not so sure this is the best idea.  I think I would have invaded at R17.  White will get some thickness, but Black's thickness is much better, especially if Black gets to play around K10 first.]
;W[ne];B[nf];W[oe];B[ng]C[rstubble: I'd like to figure out exactly why I made this move.  I didn't want to get cut at N14, but that doesn't really make the much of a difference if I just run him down the right side and take the left side.  it felt slow at the time, and feels slow still.

Ted: I think the problem was with the previous move at O14.  Simply extending from N15 to N14 helps you build territory, and doesn't leave any cutting points.

It's interesting that this all comes back to haunt you when White makes a living group in the center, and when you invade at R17.]
;W[kb]C[rstubble: seemed pretty unnecessary to me];B[md];W[nd]

;W[cp];B[dr];W[er];B[dn]C[rstubble: wanted to make sure he didn't get any ideas of jumping out to the middle...]
;W[cr];B[ds];W[bm];B[bl];W[bn];B[cl];W[jj]C[rstubble: now this is the move I wish I had made a while ago while we were putzing around with other stuff....maybe instead of D6.

Ted: It's moves like this that make me prefer territory to thickness, even if the thickness is probably better.]
;B[oj]C[rstubble: the last big capping move.];W[jh];B[lj]C[rstubble: now I'm just trying to kill eyespace.  I generally succeed, until he connects up...]

;W[le];B[ji];W[ld]C[rstubble: at this point, I figure it's game over....and it still seems like it should have been...except for a kill on the G3 group later.]

Ted: There are other White stones around!  Once there are more stones your opponent can force you towards them, and use them to take away your eye-space in the process.

Having said that, I think you also made some mistakes, and have offered a few suggestions for better possibilities.]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[oc]
(;B[rd]C[Ted: I don't like this move.  It leads to a gote sequence, giving White the initiative.  I've looked at S17, which I think gives White more chances to make a mistake.

I've included a bunch of variations, although I should point out that there might be some that I looked at, rejected, but failed to remove.]

Ted: I think you still should have lost.  White seems to have made more endgame mistakes than you.  But look on the bright side: this also means your endgame skills may be better than those of the people you normally play.  :-)]
