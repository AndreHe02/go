C[Hi.
First of all thanks to the reviewer for taking the time to comment my game.

The following file is a game played on NNGS between  Black - Teto 17k*(me)  and White - Tane 15k*

I lost by about 30 points, which I believe could have easily been made up. Please feel free to comment on any move. Any and all comments are greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Teto

Comment:
Hello,

Key issue in this game were your J17 and J15 stones. Both sides failed to take advantage of the situation regarding those stones.

Have Fun,

Comment: A and B are the usual moves here. See variation for B.]
;W[cc]
(;B[ci]LB[cd:A]C[Comment: Why do you play stone A if you just leave it later. White gets  big  corner.]
;W[ce];B[be]LB[cj:A]C[Comment: This is unnecessary move. A is much better.]
;W[bd];B[de]LB[cj:A]C[Comment: You dont achieve anything even if you win this ko.]
;W[ed]C[Comment: This is very big move.];B[pf];W[nd];B[qd]LB[pj:A]
C[Comment: A is good move after Q14.];W[qc];B[qe];W[cj]C[Comment: This is very big.]
;B[bj]LB[di:A]C[Comment: I would prefer A since you wont get low position after it.]
;W[cn];B[cl]LB[co:A][fp:B]C[Comment: This is perhaps too early. I think A or B instead are better moves.]
;W[dm];B[co]LB[fp:A]C[Comment: A is bigger.];W[ep];B[eq];W[eo]
;B[cq]LB[fq:A]C[Comment: A is better here. It is big point for both sides.]
;W[hp];B[qj]LB[oj:B][pj:A]C[Comment: This is bit low, A seems better. Later white can cap this stone with B, which could work with stones on the left side.]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[qm]LB[qi:B][qk:C][ql:D][qn:A]C[Comment: This move leaves many invasion points (A,B,C,D etc). Usually it is played at A.]
;W[kq]LB[fq:A]C[Comment: This is mistake. A is very big, so your next move is correct.]
;B[gq];W[gp]
(;B[ic]LB[jc:A]C[Comment: A is better, since you can get basic two point extension to both sides. See variation.]
;W[kc];B[ie];W[ee];B[df];W[di];B[ch]
(;W[cd]LB[fg:B][bk:A]C[Comment: This is no good. White is perhaps trying to put pressure on your left side group but its not in danger because it can connect from A. So white A is better. See variation. Also running to the center with B is good.]
;B[bg];W[fg];B[rc]LB[ig:A]SQ[ic][ie]C[Comment: Now it's important to take care of your two stones. A is correct here. It reduces the effect of whites wall.]
;W[pc];B[hq]LB[ig:A]C[Comment: This makes some profit. However A is bigger here.]

(;W[iq]LB[ig:A]C[Comment: White should have put pressure on your two stones. As you can see in the variation, same move is often good for both sides.]
;B[fc]LB[ig:A]C[Comment: This move is no good as you can see from the variation later.]
;W[ec];B[ef]LB[ig:A][bk:B]SQ[ic][ie]C[Comment: This is small move. B is good point for sides. As said, your attention should be now with the marked stones.]
;W[ff];B[ck];W[hd];B[id];W[gc];B[hc];W[gd];B[gb]LB[ig:A]C[Comment: This move is quite useless.]

;W[qq]LB[ig:A]C[Comment: Too early. White should play A here.]

(;B[el]LB[jg:A]C[Comment: Your upper side group is in danger. It is important to try live with it or connect it. You can play A here. See variation.]
;W[dl];B[dn];W[cm];B[dk];W[ek];B[ej];W[em]LB[ei:B][fk:A]C[Comment: Here I think A is bigger than B. Again, A is locally good move for both sides.]
;B[ei];W[fk];B[gi];W[ii]LB[hj:A]C[Comment: A seems better here for white.]
;B[hj];W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[qg];W[nh]LB[lh:A]C[Comment: If white gets to play A here now black will be in real trouble.]

[hl:C]C[Comment: This is too deep, something simple is good here.]
;W[hk];B[fl];W[gk];B[fm]C[I think this exchange could have ended up much better.]
;W[fn]LB[gm:A]C[A might have been better. I was trying to isolate whites group in that area.

Comment: For me it seems that you will end up with eyeless group in the middle of white stones.]
