C[Blue: Hi and thanks for reviewing this game. I feel I made a lot of very important errors in this game that costs me the win. I'll point out things I want to pay attention to but if you want to comment on any aspect of the game, feel free.

crazyd:  Hi.  I will try to review the game for you.];B[pd]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qj];W[el]C[Blue: What was up with this move? Is it just plain bad? And in general, if my opponent makes apparently bad moves i nthe early game, should I be trying to take advantage or just ignoring them and making good moves?

crazyd:  Yes - it looks bad to me.  If some obvious way to punish your opponent occurs to you, then it might be okay to play immediately.  Usually, unless they have a one-move fix, then there will be choices and it is best to save choices until you know which is best.]
;B[dj];W[fc];B[df];W[cc];B[dc];W[cb];B[db];W[cd];B[ce];W[da]
;B[ea];W[be];B[bf];W[ae];B[af];W[bc];B[hc];W[eb];B[ca];W[ba]
;B[da];W[ac];B[fe]C[Blue: I dislike this move. What would have been better? Is killing or containing those two stones actually important?

crazyd:  Maybe tenuki and if they choose to run you have a target to exploit]
;W[gd];B[id]C[crazyd:  J15 looks much better as it encloses white rather than helping white run out.]
;W[he];B[jp];W[mo]C[crazyd:  Perhaps the white stones are high because the player is high.  Should be an easy game for black.]
;B[fq];W[lq];B[cn];W[eo]C[Blue: How does one play from here? I pincered because I could and I understand it to be good, but I don't really know the followups.]
;B[cl]C[crazyd:  An alternative would be to play C3 and you will link up to one side, but this looks fine for black.]
;W[co];B[dn]C[crazyd:  D6 looks small.  The F3-K4 is bigger in this quadrant, and upper and lower right areas of the board are also hot areas.]
;W[en];B[em]C[crazyd:  Again, way too small for now.];W[fm]
;B[dm];W[fl];B[fn]C[Blue: As you can see later, this cut was not successful. Could it have been?

crazyd:  Locally J3 secures life, but a move like G5 (threatening the cut) is also available.  The cut does not seem like a good idea at this time.]
;W[fo];B[gn];W[go];B[hn];W[ho];B[hq];W[io];B[jo];W[in];B[hl]
C[crazyd:  Your last two moves don't make sense to me.  Perhaps you are misreading sequences?  If so, doing life and death problems can help.]
;W[hm];B[dq];W[cq];B[cr];W[dr];B[er];W[eq];B[es];W[dq]C[crazyd:  If white plays at D1 instead then your last few moves were wasted.  Your problems reading out sequences is becoming a theme of this game [not that your opponent is much better :)\]]
;B[ds];W[br];B[cs];W[bs];B[gr];W[jr];B[kr]C[Blue: This didn't work, what could have? Or indeed should I be focusing on much bigger things?

crazyd:  J2 would have secured life (makes two eyes).];W[kq]
;B[lr];W[mr];B[js];W[ir];B[jq];W[is];B[hr];W[ks];B[iq];W[pl]
;B[pg];W[il];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[qn];W[po]
;B[rm];W[rp]C[Blue: I've not seen this play (up to this point). What did I do wrong?

crazyd:  This is a joseki.];B[sn];W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr]C[crazyd:  The white group at S2 has 4 liberties.  IQ2 occurs to you as a possibility, do you imagine white will do anything other than P2?  So black has two liberties and white has four.  Who will win that fight?]
;W[or];B[oq];W[ps];B[ql];W[pm];B[oj];W[qm];B[qk];W[pn];B[rn]
;W[ej];B[dh];W[dk];B[ck]C[crazyd:  C10 instead of C9 prevents an atari at D11 - better shape for black.]
;W[di];B[ci];W[cj];B[bj];W[dj];B[bh];W[bn];B[bm];W[an];B[am]

;W[kg];B[lg];W[kf];B[ke];W[le]C[Blue: Here an invasion starts which ultimately is successful. I feel it should not have been had I played correctly.Can you show me where my defense failed?]
;B[jc];W[ld];B[me]C[crazyd:  If black plays L17 there should be no hope for white to live in this quadrant.]
;W[kc];B[jd];W[md];B[kd]C[crazyd:  This move, reducing your own liberties, is almost suicide.]
;W[ne];B[mf];W[lc];B[nc];W[nd];B[of];W[mb]C[crazyd:  White K18 (atari) takes the black K16 stones.]

;B[lp];W[mp];B[ok];W[ol];B[nl];W[nm]C[crazyd:  An example of white not reading.  M8 is fine for white.]
;B[ml];W[ll];B[lk];W[jl];B[kk]C[Blue: Yeah, I missed it.];W[gl]
;B[lb];W[kb];B[ma];W[ed];B[ee];W[ga];B[de];W[fa];B[mm];W[mn]

;B[rg];W[qa];B[pa];W[ra];B[se];W[sd];B[sb]C[Blue: On a personal note, I'm proud of killing this.]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[so];B[nn]C[Blue: This whole battle was entirely pointless.]
;W[om];B[op];W[no];B[sp]C[crazyd:  I am sure you know what a snapback is.  If black plays P5 instead of taking one stone at T4, then all the white stones connected to P7 are dead.]

[sm][gq][fr][fs][gs]C[Blue: So in my opinion, a few crucial mistakes cost me masses of territory. Even repelling the first invasion in the top left probably would have won me the game.

Thanks for your advice (in advance).

crazyd:  My advice for quick improvement is to do either 5-10k life and death problems, or maybe 8-12k problems if those seem too difficult, every day.  Good luck.]
