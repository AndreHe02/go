;C[Dear Reviewer,
I played this game on IGS against
TouchPoint, 22k*, black.
And I am
davpek, 21k*, white.

I lost by 9,5 points.

I thank you a lot in advance for reviewing my game. I already added a lot of comments on my moves to help you understand my thoughts and my intends.

Yours,
David];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[cd]LB[dc:a]C[Assuming I prefer the 4-3 point, would D-17 (a) have been better?


#
I cannot give you a reciept for this. I haven't studied much fuseki myself yet.
I personally would prefer to not play both stones on the third line since I prefer playing more influence-based and fight-evoking games.
But I cannot see anything speaking against both stones on the third line. Why not. Play around with this setting...]
;B[ec];W[df];B[id];W[cj]C[

#
The opening looks good.];B[pk];W[pf]LB[mp:A]C[so far black occupied 2 sides of the bord and me only one side. so I felt like invading his framework on the right side with this move.


#
Well, yes. But "Don't Panic"! You have relatively secure territory on the left side whereas black has almost all his stones on the fourth line, indicating influence, not territory.
You could play at the bottom - e.g. at A - as well and invade later on.

If I wanted to invade right now I could see nothing that speaks against your move here.]
;B[nd];W[nf]LB[pi:a]C[i wanted to keep center influence. so I decided to make this move rather than making a base for this group by playing somwhere at Q-11 (a).]
;B[ep]LB[ld:B][pi:A]C[

#
Tenuki!? Better to put pressure on the white group at the top right now.  As you already said, A would be a nice spot for black, or B, extending together with white.]

(;W[dn]LB[hp:A]TR[cj]C[this seemed to work well with the marked stone at C-10

#
Sure, but it allows black to build a nice framwork to the right with, say, A.

How about pincering the black stone (see variation)?];B[cq]

(;W[dp];B[dq];W[jq]LB[gq:a][mq:b]C[depemdimg on blacks reaction I was planning to extand either at G-3 (a) or N-3 (b)

#
You mean, it looks like sort of "miai"-situation.
Consider the variation to the next node...]
(;B[lp]C[

#
Quite obviously (see variation in last node) wrong direction.]
;W[gq];B[fq];W[fr]SQ[ep][lp]C[this was I sacrifice. I was aiming at gaining outside influence and maybe connection to the group in the lower left...

#
The white stones seem to be quite low here considering the two marked black stones standing up above them.
I acutally see no point in "digging deeper" ;-)];B[er];W[fp]
;B[eq];W[fo]C[... it worked out.

#
Right, black now has a quite uncomfortable shape. But your stones are not connected firmly either.
And how will this influence work for your needs?];B[gr];W[hr]
;B[fs];W[hp]C[

#
Black's bottom left group is secure now.]
(;B[qf]C[this move bothered me.


#
Actually this is not a good move: "don't touch weak stones because it will make them stronger"
Reducing the space for a base would have been much better here (see variation).]

(;W[od]C[I attacked. I thought I would either get corner territory or some thick ouside influence.


#
This looks like sort of special samuraian-attack: harakiri ;-)
Ok, ok, at least it looks strange to me. Better don't play that!

How about bending around R14 to start positive...];B[oc]C[

#
Black answered "correct": don't risk much, let the other one have the trouble.]
;W[oe];B[mc]C[

#
Actually I'd prefer to play solid here. This leaves less points for attacking (via cutting e.g.).
So how about O17?]
(;W[qe];B[qd];W[qg]
(;B[po];W[rf]C[now that I review it, this move does not look this urgent.


#
You maybe right. But perhaps ... (see variation to node 39)  Now white does not have to care for this group intensively anymore.]
;B[rd]C[


#
Endgame-move!];W[qm]TR[pk]C[this move was "inspired" by kageyamas book "Fundamentals of Go". He says "dont use thickness to make territory but to attack weak enemy stones."
In this sense I considered my group in the upper right "thickness" and the marked stone at Q-9 the one to be attacked.


#
You can call it thickness because you captured R14, right!? ;-)]
;B[pm];W[qk];B[qn]C[


#
Black goes for sure...];W[pl];B[ol];W[ql];B[om];W[pj];B[ok]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj]
(;W[mi]TR[ni]C[i was not sure about that move. but the matked stone at O-11 seemed so weak without it.

#
Good consideration. Does it look that weak, though? How about playing elsewhere? You see that leaning against black helps him making a strong wall against the bottom and you don't gain much of a profit.]
;B[lj]
(;W[jn]C[with extensions towards the center in the middle game I am always having a hard time. Is it alright to play here to restrict blacks influence with his thick black walls?

#
Black seems to try to make territory with his influence. And what did Kageyama say? ;-)

What about the sequence in the variation to this node?];B[lm]
;W[jl]C[
#
This move does not threat black and does not even make much of territory to the left. I'd say a one-point-jump is too narrow here.]
;B[jj];W[ge]C[His upper side seemed very lose but the way I played gave him a lot of territory. How could I have done better?


#
If you get territory, too, letting the opponent get territory is not that bad. Especially if you get more territory ;-)]

This seems to be the wrong side. Consider the beginning of the variation to this node!]

;B[le]
(;W[hi]C[and now he starts growing into my framework and I could not stop him at all..]
;B[ik];W[jk]LB[gk:A]C[


#
Wrong side! You could stopp black or reduce the damage he does to "your" territory by playing from the other side, say A...

->Sometimes one has to give away a bit of his piece of cake to get another, bigger piece ;-)]
;B[ij];W[kj]C[

#
Would be still time to play from the other side but obviously you had something else in mind...]
;B[ki];W[kk];B[jh];W[li]LB[gk:A]C[
#
Perhaps playing around A now would be better than trying something that will most likely not work...]
;B[gk];W[fj];B[hm];W[hl]C[
#
Why such a move? Looks much like this "harakiri"-move from top right.]
;B[il];W[ml];B[nl]C[what comes now is fighting and endgame. You are welcome to comment on it but I thing getting strong in those is a matter of hard work and study maybe rather than having it reviewed.

#
Ok. Then I'll leave it.

Capturing makes white strong imediatelly. So I'd prefer it.  "Black's" bottom or top are both open now and sort of miai.   I'd have to admit that I wouldn't feel too comfortable in this situation, though.]
