C[Hi, I'm Bill, zinger on KGS and black in this game.  I'm submitting this game because, during my own review, I had a harder time finding clear mistakes than I usually do.  Which means, not that there are fewer mistakes, but rather that more of the mistakes are the kind I don't see well :)

The result is immaterial.  I resigned in the late yose after carelessly losing a group as liberties were filled.  I think it was close before that, maybe I was a bit behind.

I'm looking for tips on how to better manage the fuskei, how to be more cash-efficient in the middlegame, and any other tips you can think of.  In particular I think my opponent did a better job than I did at finding big points.  My comments are marked with "z --"

Thanks very much for the review.  Your time is appreciated.

--------------------------------------

hi, my name's adum and it has been my pleasure reviewing your game. your preparation for the review was perfect, by the way, prepending your comments with "z -- " especially =)

my fuseki isn't that great, so i've made most of my comments on the fighting and middle-game. i think that's by far the most important for people under 6 dan anyway.

as usual in amateur games, the winner was decided in a fight where both sides made mistakes, and the person to make the final mistake lost the game. in this game, this occurred in the upper-right.

your biggest problem that i see getting repeated is a tendency to not tenuki enough in the middle game. more precisely, you have to ask yourself: is a move sente? is it gote? is this group alive or dead? is the move i want to play truly big, or is it only a 5-point gote endgame play? thinking about these questions will greatly improve your game.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[cq];W[pp];B[oc];W[dn];B[fp];W[cj];B[pj]C[z -- I suppose normal would be to finish the bottom left at K3, but I see how this move was could be bad.  Alas, ultimately white got to H3 first, which I think was one of my problems.

this seems fine to me.];W[jc];B[qn]C[z -- again, maybe K3?

still seems fine.];W[nq];B[cc]C[z -- too early perhaps.  But I thought if I took K3 now, white D17 or C16 would be too large.

this seems playable, although even after D17 or C16 white's framework would still be invadeable, so you could tenuki. however, K3 is now small after O3 because the bottom side is uninteresting.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[bd]C[z -- oops, of course F18 should be played first.]
;W[be];B[bc];W[fb]C[z -- now this black is sente.  It seems that cutting at C15 would not work, so ...

well, it's sente at least, and creates aji. see variation]
(;B[db];W[cf];B[je];W[mc]
(;B[he]C[z -- after the game my opponent suggested N15 instead of this.  I think he was right.

yeah, i like N15 much better too. builds up a moyo and keeps your stones connected.]
;W[me];B[ic];W[ib]
(;B[hc];W[jd];B[ie];W[mg];B[ih];W[hq]C[z -- dang, white got here first.

not such a big deal]
(;B[fq]C[z -- I couldn't find a move I really liked here.  I figured, at least this one keeps sente for sure.

see variation.];W[jp];B[rp];W[qq];B[on];W[co]C[z -- this one turned out big for white.

yeah, it's a huge move];B[pg]C[but so is this];W[mi];B[ee]C[i don't like this move because later you might want to cut here. if you eventually play H18, it could cause white problems. but this peep encourages white to fix one of those weaknesses now.]
;W[hb];B[dg];W[df];B[fg]C[good];W[ef]
(;B[eg]C[these are great exchanges for black. white is overconcentrated. still, this move is a little heavy]
;W[ej]C[white helps keep black heavy.]
(;B[ij]C[z -- I felt that defending this group was right, but maybe this is the wrong point?

this is a really slow move. black is stronger in this area and can move out faster if you're worried. it's hard to say that black is in danger, but on the other hand, moving out has a lot of value too]
;W[fn]C[z -- another nice big point for white.

not so big. it's a dame point only separating two relatively strong groups.]
;B[ch]C[this move isn't so big because white is alive on both sides. it's worth about 12 points on territory, but you can probably find bigger moves elsewhere]
;W[gi];B[ff];W[fe]
(;B[fd]C[z -- G15 probably better.

best just to tenuki. this move is better than G15 since it's sente at least. but it's worse than tenuki]
;W[ed];B[bj];W[bk];B[bi];W[cl]C[this exchange is good. white is now way overconcentrated.]
;B[il]C[z -- I think H9 would have been better - defending while "looking in" to his territory.  But maybe no move on this group is needed at all.

your group already seems safe. white cannot realistically attack any time soon. so better to play elsewhere... H9 isn't much better since white has no real territory on the left there, and what he does have is very thick after the B10 exchange. you're wasting your time trying to reduce now. at least J8 might help with the bottom-right.]
;W[hk];B[ik];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[gr];W[hr]
(;B[dr]
(;W[qf]C[z -- white could have done much better here, and then would have been well ahead.  After the game we thought wQ12 followed by crosscut would have been good.

i agree with that. there are probably a lot of ways to invade, but this isn't a good one.]
;B[pf];W[qe];B[pd]C[very good move. white is in trouble now]
;W[rh]
(;B[rj]C[this move is awkward. see variation for a clean kill]
;W[qi];B[qj]C[your shape is hurt now. i don't think you can kill white]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[re];B[qg];W[rg]
(;B[sf]C[z -- I think T17 would also have killed, and prevented what follows in the corner.

neither way seems to kill to me. see variation.];W[oh]C[this move stinks. much better at Q11 as in previous variations. you got lucky here =)]
;B[pi];W[ph];B[qh];W[pe];B[oe];W[of];B[ri];W[og];B[qi];W[rb]
;B[sc]C[z -- perhaps just R18 is better, but still I would have to take his stones off the board.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[ne];B[od];W[qa];B[qc];W[ob];B[pa]C[bad. in fact, you don't need to play in this corner at all now. better to tenuki.]
;W[oa];B[sb]C[again, should tenuki];W[ra];B[sa]C[again, should tenuki]
;W[nc];B[pa]C[again, should tenuki];W[qa]C[you're lucky your opponent is making 2 point gote moves.]

(;B[mk]C[z -- this one looked big, but perhaps I should have pressed on white with N3 first (or sometime earlier).

yeah, this isn't so big. better to reduce white, as you say.]
;W[mn];B[no];W[mo];B[np];W[mp];B[rq];W[rr];B[pr]C[z -- this just didn't work.

nope. but it could have worked better, i think];W[qr];B[oq]

definitely ko is good for you because white can get in big trouble if he loses it, whereas you only lose one stone. one-sided ko's are great.]
