;B[ed]C[A rather strange move- more usually at d14];W[jd];B[cg]
;W[ff];B[ef];W[ee]C[splunk: didn't like this as soon as i played. is f12 the proper move? even j14 maybe.

scalpel: this move is small and gives black sente. Defending the upper right with R16/Q17 or an approach move in the lower left are bigger.]
;B[df];W[de]C[scalpel: this move accomplishes nothing except giving sente to black again!]
;B[ce];W[fe];B[mq]C[sp: thought about e18 & then cut at c16 to try to kill e17 group, but as variation shows, glad i didn't.

scalpel: The largest unsettled area is the left side, and this is urgent!]

(;W[qo];B[oq];W[op];B[np];W[oo];B[no];W[nn];B[pr];W[qq];B[eh]
C[scalpel: this is far too close to the thickness above. C9 or D9 are better]
;W[or]C[sp: i think p2 is a little small.

scalpel: that's right! This is a sente-endgame move, and should be saved for the late middle game or as a ko threat.]
;B[nq];W[qr];B[ln];W[om]C[sp: N6 instead?

scalpel: better, but the time for middle-game fighting is when the opening frameworks are decided. There are some very large points on the left side and top right.]
;B[ml];W[md];B[gh];W[if];B[ii];W[cn]C[sp: B lower left looking huge.]
;B[dn];W[co];B[do];W[cp];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[dm]C[sp: trying to get influence into center.

scalpel: this is the right idea...];B[em];W[dl];B[dj];W[el]
C[sp: think c9 would have been better.

scalpel: this is a good, thick move];B[fn];W[jh]C[scalpel: defending the left side group at c9 is good now. It threatens to extend further up the side and gives a base for extending centrally to reduce Black's moyo.]
;B[bl];W[bm];B[cl];W[cm];B[ao]C[scalpel: this attack is premature]
;W[al];B[am];W[an];B[bp];W[ap]C[sp: missed the obvious play @ b5]
;B[aq];W[ck];B[bk];W[bj];B[bo];W[bn];B[br];W[dk];B[fl];W[kj]
;B[ek];W[cj]C[scalpel: unnecessary, this group is alive. Take sente to strengthen top right]

;B[hb];W[jb]C[scalpel: hane at e18 or block at f18. It will be hard for black to live here!]

;B[ib];W[ka];B[in];W[ie]C[sp: overplay?

scalpel: no defence needed here! "Minus one point in gote!"]
;B[qc]C[Scalpel: This corner invasion is huge at this stage of the game. Defending against it was a priority 100 moves ago!]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[qb];B[rb];W[pb];B[sc];W[rf];B[rd]
;W[pe]C[scalpel: this move was a mistake. There was a chance to kill the black corner group, or at least make him fight a ko for it by the hane at  s19]
;B[sf];W[sg]C[scalpel: this should be at t15];B[se];W[ra];B[sb]
;W[qa];B[rh];W[qh]C[sp: should have connected at s13.

scalpel: correct];B[rg];W[qf]C[scalpel: this connection is wrong. play sll instead and seal black in.]

;B[im];W[ei];B[fi](;W[lf]C[scalpel: There is a possible attack on the L upper corner. Cut at c15, and if black fails to connect at e18 cut there next wins the h18 group.]
