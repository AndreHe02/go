;B[pc];W[cp];B[cd];W[pq];B[pj]TR[qo][po][eq][ep]C[Depending on your style, the point marked with the diamond, closing the upper right corner, or one of the triangle points, taking the game to White, would be more usual. The actual move invites invasion.]
;W[qe]C[The invasion will take some of the territory black has outlined. This is not bad in itself, since the invaded territory is still large. Now black wants to confine white to a small base on the side, and build outside influence.]
;B[pf]C[Sooner or later, white must fight here, either to escape to the center or to make a narrow life on the side.]
;W[eq]C[But other large moves should be taken first.];B[dc]
TR[ec][ed]C[Too tight.  One of the points marked with a triangle makes a larger territory that is just as solid.]
;W[cj]C[White's formation on the left is ideal, with a strong base in the corner and a good extension from the wall.]
;B[bf]TR[ch]C[Timid. Black can extend to the marked stone, or can ignore the left side and begin the attack on the lower right.]
;W[eo]TR[ej]C[Inferior. White makes a much bigger moyo by taking the marked point.]
;B[gc]TR[jd]C[With such strength in both corners, black should take the marked point in the center, which works as an extension from both sides.]
;W[jq]TR[po]C[Reasonable, although the marked point may be somewhat better.]
;B[lc]C[Too much concentration. Black need not fear an invasion here. It would be better to attack in the lower right corner.]
;W[qo]C[Black and white are very even here, with two solid corners and half a side marked out for each. Both sides must build their own moyos, and at the same time invade the opponent's moyo.]
;B[ql];W[dl]C[The opening is at an end. Attack and invasion are now in order.]
;B[qd]TR[kp][jl][jk]C[Attacking the isolated, nearly!
  d!
ead stone     accomplishes nothing e
;W[hp

Timid. Black can still press down in the lower right. The marked points would make the left side of the moyo extremely strong and much larger, while also limiting black's potential to invade to the right, and to move to the center.]
;B[jd]TR[ji]C[There is no weakness in black's formation for this stone to protect. Moving strongly into the center at the marked point, or pressing white with a stone on the fourth line are both very big moves.]
;W[mq]TR[om][jk][kl][rm]C[Similarly, white is not strengthening a weak point by playing so low.  Any of the marked points would secure new territory and threaten black.]
;B[qh]C[Black is wasting another move on a dead white stone.]
;W[bh];B[mj]C[At last, a move toward the middle!  But not far enough.]
;W[dg]C[An invasion should be more aggressive.];B[df]C[Black's move defends a strong formation that doesn't need it, while leaving the moyo wide open to invasion through the middle.]
;W[cg]C[Not needed.];B[cf]C[Not needed.];W[rd]TR[qe]C[This stone is dead. Playing here forces black to make a stronger formation, nothing more.]
;B[rc]C[Necessary.];W[fg]C[Still too timid.];B[ff]C[Black should build his moyo in the middle, or push down on white on the bottom.]
;W[eg]C[Not needed.];B[gg]C[This hane allows white to push in and give black a line of three separated stones. This move should be one line higher.]
;W[ef];B[ee];W[gi]C[White should play one line higher, in contact with the black stone. Black's disconnected chain would be vulnerable.]
;B[ge]TR[gh]C[The chain was not in danger. Black should take the marked point that white left open.]
;W[ih]C[Aha! An invasion!];B[jh];W[hh]C[Too cautious.];B[hg]
;W[gh]TR[ig]C[Not needed. Invade at the marked point.];B[ig]
C[Black now has a large, secure moyo. White, on the other hand, has left a huge gap for black to invade through.]
;W[jj]C[The left side is becoming more secure, but the right side is still wide open.]
;B[ji];W[kl];B[kj];W[jk]C[The last four moves have unnecessarily defended strong walls rather than take bigger moves in the gap in white's wall.]
;B[pe]C[Pointless. Black cannot kill the dead white stones over again.]
;W[ii];B[ki];W[qf]C[Nonsense.];B[re]C[White cannot make life here. Black's move is unnecessary.]
;W[ml]C[Long overdue.];B[sd]C[A wasted move.];W[ol]TR[qm]C[One more white move can seal the moyo's boundary. White should be aiming at the marked point.]
;B[ok]TR[pm]C[It is almost too late to invade white's moyo at the marked point, but that is still the better strategy. This defensive move is not necessary.]
;W[nl]TR[pm]C[Too concentrated. Block the remaining gap at the marked point instead.]
;B[nk];W[pm]C[The middle game is over. All that remains is to fill in the gaps in this long wall.]
;B[rf]C[Nonsense.];W[qm];B[rl];W[rm];B[sm];W[sn];B[sl];W[rn]
;B[pl];W[ng]C[With what hope?];B[nf];W[lk];B[lj];W[in]TR[mk]
[kk][bg][ag]C[Not needed, and decreases white's score by filling in a point of territory.   Only the marked points still matter.]

C[The marked point is a better connection.];W[nd];B[nc];W[kg]
;B[kf];W[lf];B[me];W[ke];B[je]TR[jf]C[Why let white have a prisoner? The marked point is better.]

TR[kc]C[It hardly matters, but the marked point is better.]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[jc];B[ic];W[jb];B[ib]TR[lb]C[You don't have a shicho (ladder) here, since there are three liberties at the other end of this group. You should connect at the marked point instead of letting white make an eye.]
;W[lb];B[ne];W[ka];B[od]TR[mb]C[This move lets white make eye space at the marked point and live. White's point for life is also black's point to kill.]
;W[mb]TR[kb][la]C[White is alive. Black cannot prevent white from getting the marked points as eyes.]
;B[he]TR[nb]C[Black needs to take the marked point as soon as possible to minimize the damage from white's invasion.]
;W[kf];B[lg];W[nb];B[bm]TR[ob]C[The marked point would minimize the damage. The black stone is dead, with correct defense by white.]
;W[oa]TR[ob]C[There is no reason for white to stop extending on the second line at the marked point.]
;B[pa]TR[pb]C[Black throws away a stone.];W[pb]C[White takes the gift.]
;B[qb]C[Better.];W[qa];B[ra]C[Right.];W[dk]TR[pa]C[Not needed.]
;B[pa];W[ob]C[Right.];B[qa]TR[mk][kk][bg][ag]C[The marked points are again the only ones that should matter, just as at move 76.]

TR[ma]C[If black is allowed to connect this stone to the outside, white will have a false eye. The simplest way for white to make life is to take this stone and connect on the same point, making a real eye.]
;W[bn];B[ia]TR[kb]C[The white group at the top should be dead, since the marked point is now a false eye.]
;W[cq];B[mf];W[kb];B[ma]C[Correct.];W[br];B[kh]C[A one-point move.]
;W[ao]C[Not needed.];B[la]C[Not needed.];W[na]C[Useless.];B[ma]
C[Not needed.];W[la];B[ma];W[am];B[bg]C[Worth 2 points.];W[ag]
C[Correct.];B[af];W[ah];B[mk]TR[kk]C[If black can take the marked point, white has to connect at a cost of one point.]
;W[ch]C[Not needed.];B[pk]C[Not needed.];W[aq]C[Not needed.]

TR[km]C[Playing at the marked point instead seals black in.]
;B[lm];W[ll]TR[mm]C[A blunder. Connect at the marked point instead.]
;B[mm]C[Now black has one eye, and should be killed easily.]
;W[oo];B[mo];W[on];B[km];W[nm];B[kr];W[ln];B[kq];W[jr]C[A complete blunder. Connect at the star point. These two stones aren't going anywhere on their own.]

TR[ir]C[Another blunder.];B[ir];W[js];B[is];W[ls];B[hq];W[gq]
TR[gr]C[This move gives black eye space. A black stone at the marked point kills.]

;B[ep];W[kk]C[The last dame is filled. The game should end here.

Further moves in enemy territory have values of zero points at best, and moves inside live groups have values of minus one.]
