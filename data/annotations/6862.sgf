Agreed  - white must have be under the delusion that you had to answert at G8 - 

Again - you should have invaded at C3 

Alternatively you could have reinforced you own top right corner instead]

MY comments

Not a bad game  - but marred by some real blunders by white.

White played rather better strategically and would have won easily (several times) but for these errors

Please try to be more polite to your opponents in future and don't make invasions that are hopeless unless your opponent slips up badly (especially if you are ahead anyway).

Maybe the time limits were short - if so then this type of game shouldn't be submitted to the gtl.]
