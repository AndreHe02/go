C[Synapse [24k?\]: Hello
Hammer [22k?\]: hi


Hello, I am Quarrel, I will do my best to help you out.  Sorry this took so long.]
;B[pd]C[Hammer [22k?\]: are you german?];W[cc]C[Synapse [24k?\]: No, sorry]
;B[co];W[qq];B[jc];W[cj];B[jq]C[Did you consider d3?  Generally a shimari (the corner enclosure at d3) is good from your c5 stone.]
;W[pj]C[For both of you, I think these extensions on the side would be better as smaller enclosures of your corners.  Then afterward, extend to the sides.]
;B[qh];W[qi];B[ph]C[Good sequence for you];W[qn];B[eq]C[Right idea, but d3 is probably better]
;W[cf];B[he]C[Maybe H15 would be better placed at e.g. F17?

If you want to extend from your k17 stone, yes f17 would be much better than this move.   And you could also extend from your k3 stone to o3.]
;W[ed]C[Strange move for white];B[nf]C[This move is iffy...it would probably be better placed extending from your group at the bottom, for example.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]C[Do you see the weakness in this move?  See variation.  If white plays atari at r14, you must fill at q15, and white can capture a stone with s13.    Black can deal with this problem, but it is still quite big because it pretty much ensures life for white.  If you had played r14 instead of s14 (the usual move), white would have to make more moves to ensure life.]

(;W[pb]C[I think I screwed up dealing with the 3-3 invasion, but not sure exactly how]
;B[rd];W[rc]C[White let you off very easy here.  But now you have left q18 unanswered.]
;B[se];W[ob];B[oc]C[This move does not do much.  White can creep along the 2nd line forever if you do not jump ahead one stone.]
;W[nc];B[nd]C[leaving an atari at q15 could be problematic.  But that was because of your move at p17.]
;W[mc];B[lc]C[This is an unfortunate predicament, but I would recommend playing at n16 instead of this move.  At the very least you will drive white into your k17 stone, he cannot get beyond that very easily.  You have left a giant hole in your wall, white can now cut off your stones at the top center.]
;W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[kc];W[le]C[I think there must be some way to stop the snake cutting my stones


Unfortunately the mistakes were committed earlier, and black has a major problem now.  First you need to worry about making your group on the top live, then you can try to lean on the white stones in the lower left to salvage some territory.]
;B[lf];W[ke];B[kf];W[je];B[id];W[jf]C[You need a base quick if you want your top group to live.  Say f17]
;B[ig]C[You don't want to drive white out further.];W[jg];B[kg]
;W[jh];B[lj]C[Good];W[gq];B[gp];W[fq];B[fp];W[er]C[I'm sure there were better alternatives here as well]
;B[dr]C[Same problem as before..white ataris, and captures a stone.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[cr];B[cq];W[ds];B[dp];W[dr];B[bq]C[Right idea, but h3 would probably be better.]
;W[hq];B[iq]C[This move does not help much.  One line higher would be better.]
;W[hp];B[mq]C[You need to play h5...worry about your two stones on the bottom after.]
;W[oq];B[nn];W[qk];B[oj]C[Think about attacking white's stone on the left using the power of the wall at the bottom left.  You can play a "shoulder hit" at d9 for example, to try to regain some territory.  You also need to deal with white's stones at h4.  Again white has a safe position from which he can snake through, same as on top.  Needless to say the snakes are very very bad.]
;W[gc];B[hc];W[gd];B[hd]C[White has beat you to it..you are a bit lacking in eye space on the top.]
;W[cm]C[Not looking good now];B[dm];W[dl];B[em];W[el];B[fl]
;W[hn]C[White has the right idea.  You are in trouble buddy.  Needed to play h5]
;B[ho];W[io];B[go];W[ip];B[in]C[Ok];W[kp];B[jp]C[I would actually have extended my cutting stone at j6 to kill the white h6 stone..you can't let white out here, or you're done.]
;W[jo];B[ko];W[kn];B[lo];W[im]C[Ouch];B[kq]C[This stone is pretty much unnecessary compared to the urgency of your lower left group.]
;W[gm];B[fm];W[hr]C[White has now completely split apart your groups, they are both weak (and potentially dead). You need some eye space.]
;B[ir];W[ej];B[hl]C[That is the way to exploit the weakness of white's g7 move.]
;W[hm];B[jm]C[But now you need to follow it up by connecting at g8..then at least you have a way out.]
;W[jn];B[fg];W[eg];B[lb];W[mb];B[gb];W[fb];B[eb]C[What are you trying to do here?]
;W[hb];B[ha]C[Play J18 instead.];W[ga]C[Synapse [24k?\]: oops]
;B[ib];W[ia];B[ja]C[This group could be dead now, if white plays correctly.  See the variation..you will be left with only one eye.]

(;W[sc];B[sd];W[pe];B[pf]C[Careless

White could have caused problems even if you had filled.  You had inherent weakness in this wall.]
;W[od];B[ne];W[oe];B[of];W[ok];B[ha];W[gb];B[ia]C[See how the j17 space is not an eye yet?  You are still not alive.]
;W[ff];B[gg];W[gf];B[hf];W[eh];B[ge];W[fe];B[ei]C[What do you hope to do with this move?  Besides giving your top group life, the most urgent places on the board are finding some eye space for your bottom groups.  But I don't see any way that black will win this game now.  White has enormous, basically impregnable territory in the upper left and bottom right, and safe groups in the upper right and lower left that he can use to devastate your posititions.]
;W[di];B[dh]C[?];W[fi];B[ef];W[dd]C[Synapse [24k?\]: thanks for the game
Hammer [22k?\]: thx for the game
Hammer [22k?\]: c a
Synapse [24k?\]: bye


You pretty much had to resign.  If it makes you feel any better I think white was somewhat stronger than he claimed.  And even if he wasn't, two stones stronger is quite a lot.  At many times you have the right idea, but I think you need to work on reading (try a book of problems like Graded Go Problems for Beginners), and especially just keep playing for practice.  Eventually you will not make these simple mistakes (like leaving the holes in your wall to let white snake through).

Feel free to email me back the sgf file with comments/questions about what I wrote.  My address is ben123@fuse.net

Hope this helped])
