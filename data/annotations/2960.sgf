C[Hi!
I am a real Go fan.What i mean is i really love the game.
But my game skill is very poor.
I hope someone can point the bad hand in my game.Thanks alot.

Hi!
My name is Peter Hoehe, go4fun on some go servers. 
Thanks a lot for letting me review your game. I think you are really o Go fan. You are experimenting with a lot of unconventional moves. It was fun to play through the game  for me.
My comments are prefixed with g4:
Peter];B[pc];W[pe]C[g4: Strange.];B[nd]C[g4: Strange too. Black can answer of course, but taking another corner seems bigger, esp. because black will get 3 then.]
;W[pd]C[g4: Another strange move by white. R17 orsomething around Q11 would by normal.]
;B[qc]C[g4: Very good.];W[qd]C[g4: Empty triangle is bad shape. The only porpose is the threat of white P17.]

(;B[ph]C[g4: Very risky. What will you do against white P17 now?]

(;W[qh]C[g4: This is an emergancy move. White should have played P17 right now, (see var).]
;B[qg]C[g4: I would prefer R11 for outside influence. I white lives small at the side, nothing can be better for black.]
;W[pg];B[pf];W[og];B[qf];W[of];B[qi];W[rh];B[ri];W[od]C[g4: Another bad shape move. Connecting solid at P15 is sufficient.]
;B[oc];W[ne];B[md];W[re]C[g4: White should P12 first.];B[rg]
;W[rf]C[g4: This is like a tenuki.]
(;B[pm]C[It is OKay for me!
g4: This is very good for black. But because your group is strong here you should take another corner, Q4 or R4 seems apropriate.]
;W[qo]C[g4: If there, its better to take the corner with R4 or perhaps Q3.]
;B[pq]C[g4: Good!];W[qq]
(;B[pp]C[g4: This move is only valid if there is a black stone around K4. I would prefer R2.]
;W[qp]
(;B[rn]C[g4: Greedy. This move tries to kill white. This is not possible. Black is too weak here.]
;W[po];B[mp];W[pr]C[g4: This secures only the corner. I think white should run into the open space first.]
;B[or];W[qr];B[nq];W[qn];B[qm];W[ro];B[iq]C[g4: Good! But again, taking a corner seems bigger.]
;W[rm]C[g4: Very bad. This is gote and worth 3 to 4 points.]
;B[rl];W[sn]
(;B[ep]C[g4: Again I would prefer D4. If white invades black will gain a lot by attacking.]
;W[cp]
(;B[dq]C[g4: Too small. Better something around D6. After D6 black P5 becomes a threat, because of the black moyo.]
;W[cq]C[g4: Too small too.];B[cm]C[g4: You can also consider D7 or D6 to build up your mojo.]
;W[eo];B[fo];W[dp];B[eq];W[cn]
(;B[do]C[g4: Too greedy. What about E6 instead?];W[en];B[dm]
;W[dn];B[cj];W[cc]C[g4: Up to here black has a won game. Let's count a little:
Black has 10 in the upper right, 10 on the right side, 30 on the lower side.
White has 4 in the upper left, 10 in the lower right and 10 in the lower left. 
So you are leading by nearly 30 points, all your groups are secure, and you can build up a mgnificent mojo, which will prevent your opponent from getting some territory at the same time.
By playing O7 the game is almost over.];B[cf]C[g4: As you are leading C13 is simpler.]
;W[fc];B[me];W[mf];B[hd]C[g4: Do you need outside influence there? If not J17 or H17 are better.]
;W[hb];B[ic];W[ib];B[jb];W[jc]
(;B[jd]C[g4: This is only valid, if you are sure to kill the white stone. If not simply extending is better.]
;W[kc]C[g4: Now black is one move behind.];B[kb];W[lc];B[lb]
;W[kd]
(;B[mc]C[g4: Too early. First push once with K15.];W[je];B[id]
;W[ke];B[lf];W[mg]
(;B[ee]C[g4: This is not so good. First it is essential to cut white apart with M15. The he has to run away with his 6 stones. Your 4 stones, which are also weak will connect with the left side. So this is ideal for you.
Second locally the leaning move at F16 is sente, so this retains you sente.]
;W[ge]C[g4: Now you are in serious trouble.];B[gc];W[gb];B[fd]
;W[gd];B[ec];W[hc];B[eb];W[ce]
(;B[cd]C[g4: Simply entending at D14 is enough.];W[bd];B[dd]
;W[bf];B[de];W[be]
(;B[dc]C[g4: Much too small. C13 is the only move];W[cb]C[g4: C13 is the only move (for white too)]
;B[cg]C[g4: Good!];W[bg];B[bh];W[dh]C[It is the big problem
that i dont know how to confront.];B[eg]C[g4: Good!];W[eh]
(;B[fh]C[g4: This leaves a cutting point behind. Simply extend.]
;W[ch];B[bi];W[fg]C[g4: Ouch.];B[ef]C[g4: Difficult.];W[fi]
;B[gh];W[ej];B[gi];W[gj];B[ff]C[g4: Geta with G14 secures one eye.]
;W[fn];B[go];W[el];B[gn]C[g4: This is not he focal point. Your left side group is not secure. Something like B6 is necessary.]
;W[gl];B[gf];W[hg];B[gg];W[dg];B[hf];W[he];B[if];W[ie];B[jh]
;W[hj];B[mm]TR[bh][bi][cj][cm][dm]C[the no-mind hand....
The marked stone is not safe yet.
g4: You got it. This is essential.];W[bk]C[here it comes!];B[bl]
C[g4: Good answer.];W[ck];B[dk];W[dl];B[fk];W[ek];B[mj]TR[bh]
[bi][cj][dk][bl][cm][dm]CR[lj][nj][oj][pj][kk][jl][hm][im][nm]
[om][mn][mo][dr][ds]C[no mind again
The marked stone is blocked and deadly.
And it's almost imposible to win the game.
g4: The marked stones are dead. But you still have a big mojo. If you count, whites 50 points at the left side, 10 points at the top and ten points at the bottom right, black has 15 points on the top right, and a mojo of nearly 60 points.
And at last white's top right group is not secure. So the game is difficult but not lost.]
;W[ii];B[ih];W[hi];B[hh];W[rc]C[g4: This is enssential.];B[im]
C[too conservative.
g4: Yes. First block with S18. This is sente as it threatens T17.]
;W[oi]
(;B[ok];W[pj];B[gm];W[fl]C[g4: Not necessary I think.]

;B[qj];W[ql];B[pk];W[om];B[pl];W[on]C[g4: Better O5.];B[no]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[ml];B[ll];W[mk]C[g];B[nj]C[g4: Better O11 for more speed.]

;W[tt];B[ka];W[ia];C[my own Conclusion:
I lost the left-side stones and the game finally.
Also there are too many
dunt-know-how  hands in the game.I should be aggressive.

g4: You played a very reasonable game. You were leading with nearly 20 points. 
In the opening the corner moves are biggest, then kakaris and shimaris, then extenstions. Try to use this.
Take care of your own stones. You just lost the game because your left side stoines are killed. If you are not quite sure, if they can live for their own, and you are leading, just add a stone. It will prevent a lot of headache.]
