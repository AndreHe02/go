C[I'm Jonahx, playing as white. Thanks for reviewing my game! I've been reading some of Yilun Yang's books, and trying to play a good opening. I felt like I did well, but some critical mistakes took me down (as usual!) It would be great to hear how to avoid getting into trouble in the first place, and any critique of the opening. I know my end game needs more work, but I'm less concerned about that right now. I feel pretty good about my opening, but not so great about the middle.

Thanks for all the help, I really appreciate it.

----------------------------------------------
Hello,

I am Jens-Uwe Gaspar and around 5k on DGS /KGS (user 'jug'), so please take my comments in this review not as the absolute truth, though I will try and give what insights I can at my level. The review focuses on Whites moves, though you can find also some comments on Black moves from which something can be learned as well.

All my comments begin with 'JUG'. If you find an unknown japanese go-term, which i use often, you may find an explanation on Sensei's Library http://senseis.xmp.net/, which is also a great free resource about all topics of Go.

JUG: How to read the review:

Follow the the main-path in the SGF first. You will find directions of how to explore the variations from there, though not all vars (variations) are explicitly pointed out (so you have to explore them by yourself as well).

Used abbreviations are: B=Black, W=White, NW=north-west (top left), SE=south-east (bottom right), notation 'X' refers to a marked letter or number on the board, for example: W at 'A', B plays at 'C', wA1=W-move at A1, bT1=B-move at T1, "@a1" = move at A1.
When there is a variation, the games original path is marked with 'A' while variations start on other letters 'B, C, D, ...'

I've tried to point out what you asked for, but also commented on all your many original variations (though sometimes i shortened them a bit). I felt tempted to remove the original variations because it could be too confusing to keep them all, but as you put so much effort in them, i decided to keep them as I think they could also be used to correct some thinkings: up to move #33 the variations could be a bit overwhelming, but to get the most out of this review you have to check all moves in them as some of the important things can be found in the variations as well ;-)
At the end of the game i finish with a summary.

Finally, something important to note about variations:
Keep in mind that variations must always be seen with care, because there are soo many possibilities, that the "real" outcome can be very different. This applies to players of all strengths. Most important is, that when you explore variations to always assume the BEST response (what the "board" wants) ... and NOT what move you would EXPECT from your opponent.

Enjoy the review!

Cheers,

(;B[eq]LB[cj:A][po:B][qo:C]C[JUG: B at 'B' or 'C' instead (see var before) looks more promising for B, because Bs left shimari (corner enclosure) now faces an opponent stone which restricts development of Bs side.]
;W[cj]LB[fc:A][dd:D][dj:C][po:B]C[JUG: There's the proverb "First corner, then side, then center", which is about, that "corner plays" are bigger because a corner is easier to hold than the side or the center. For a corner you only need to defend two sides, so you need less stones to make territory than on the side (with 3 sides to defend) or the center (with 4 sides to defend).

Out of this reason, an approach of W at 'B' looks better. It's on the 4th-line to have a better "relationship" with Ws two top stones, which are also high going more for an influence-based game.

wC10 is a good side, because it takes away Bs development of his shimari (corner enclosure) in the SW-corner and it can be seen as extension from Ws 'D'-stone in the NW-corner.
However as Ws top stones are high, taking W at 'C' instead would be a slightly better option.

You mentioned you have books from Yilun Yang. Perhaps also his "Fundamental Principles of Go", which is a very good book to improve your openings and middle-game tactics. Yilun Yang would classify an approach around 'B' as 2nd-class while wC10 would also be 2nd-class but with lesser value. For reference see (chapter "B. Second class moves", page 13) or in the general memo "Outline of Ranking of Big Opening Moves" (page 18) in that book for more details.]
;B[fc]LB[hc:C][ic:A][id:D][pd:G][cf:F][df:B][cj:E]C[JUG: W next at 'A' is not a joseki and generally unfavourable for W.

I prefer the simple answer at 'B', which is best in my opinion and also keeps the game simple.
Without Ws 'E'-stone, also W at 'F' is normal, but with 'E' in place, W at 'B' instead makes a better relationship with 'E' and W may end in sente.

A pincer is possible, but it gives B more choices to decrease the efficiency of Ws 'E'-stone (see comments in next vars). If you want a pincer you can try 'D' which works better together with Ws 'G'-stone, or you can try 'C' which is a more common and easier-to-handle pincer.

---
There are lot of joseki. A joseki is a standard sequence of moves, that ends in a balanced situation for both players.
The complexity of joseki is about choosing a good one, that matches the current whole-board situation. Each stone on the board can influence the effectiveness (if ladders are involved for example).

The important thing about joseki is to understand WHY a certain move is used. If you know the reasons behind moves, this will help in your games, because the principles in different situations are often similar (even if you don't know the specific joseki). I've added some hints about joseki in the variations.

You put a lot of effort in the analysis in your game. That can help a lot in becoming better, extending your knowledge about other possibilities that can be used in future games. A good way is, if you manage to learn one or two new joseki with each game-analysis. But not only memorize them, try to understand the moves (WHY they are mad, for this a teacher can be helpful or asking a stronger player or asking for a review ;-)

If you want to study more joseki i recommend "Kogo's Joseki Dictionary", which can be freely downloaded at: http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm]
(;W[ic];B[cc]LB[dc:B][ic:D][cd:A][pd:E][cj:C]C[Which way better to block here? I was thinking that at C16 follows the "block to the wider side" rule and created a bigger area, though the usual continuatino of the block at D17 looks good too, putting the stone at F17 in a bad place.

JUG: Some notes on the current situation:

- both W-stones 'C' and 'D' are low, which is not good with a wall W would get here (after B taking the corner), also 'D' would be a bit too close to the wall afterwards and W will probably end in gote
- both 'A' and 'B' have backdraws for W, but I would go for wD17 at 'B' (variation bC16, wD15, etc), because 'D' is already there and the wall will face the side with 'E' (wQ16), which is a development of the Ws top side, which has more promise compared to the left side, which is taken half by B on NW- and SW-corner (so less development for W there)

However, W at 'A' is not outright bad of course but is playable as well:

- the left side is occupied by the SW-shimari (corner enclosure), which B would like to develop, but is hindered by 'C' already
- 'C' is low on 3rd-line but one space farer away from the resulting wall
- giving 'C' more support is ok allowing to destroy Bs wanted development on the left even more
- joseki might be less attractive with blocking at 'A', because B has more choices
- getting B stronger on the top could damage 'D' being too close

Moves in fuseki (opening) often have such subtle differences. But these come more into play when you become stronger.
If i had to pinpoint a problem to Ws (unfavourable) position I would blame the previous move at 'D' (and 'C').]
(;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed]LB[ec:B][gd:A]C[JUG: good, that's a vital point for both players shape.
B at 'B' next instead of 'A' would be a joseki (see next var).]
(;B[gd]LB[ec:C][lc:A][mc:B]TR[fc]C[JUG: bG16 was a mistake by B. Normal would be 'C' instead (see var before), because this leaves a weakness, so W may cut through and retake the corner or devastate Bs marked stones at bF17/ bG16.]
(;W[lc]LB[ec:C][kc:F][mc:B][pd:E][qf:A][po:D]C[Maybe a wider extension here? to N17?

JUG: Yes, locally wN17 at 'B' would look better as it also helps the NE-corner-stone 'E' against an approach (=multi-purpose move), and Ws fear of a B invasion at 'F' is nothing to be afraid of.

A good alternative would be to punish B for his mistake with a W move at 'C' (see var before).

Globally W could also choose to approach Bs SE-corner at 'D', though 'C' is bigger.]
;B[qf]LB[lc:E][mc:F][nd:G][qd:C][re:D][pj:A][qj:B]C[I was thinking a loose pincer, since I don't have help on the other side

JUG: yes, W is reasonable stable at the top, so it's a good idea to stop Bs development with a lose pincer (on 'A').

Alternatives:
- with a W stone on 'F', W at 'C' would close the corner, but it is a bit defensive
- 'D' is sometimes possible going after Bs base (especially if W has stones already on the top) -> check possible variations in Joseki-dictionary
- 'G' would be too narrow to 'E' and the corner is still open
- lose pincer on 'A' looks ok, 'B' seems to be inferior (see next var)]
(;W[pj];B[qi]LB[qc:B][qj:C][qm:A]C[JUG: B at bR11 is unusual, easier would be B at 'B'.

B is (diagonally) "touching" a weak W-stone, which allows W to become stronger.
There's a principle: "if being touched, touch back". I would say, the only move here for W is at 'C' (imagine B getting it instead).]
;W[qm]LB[pj:C][qj:B][pk:D][qo:A]C[JUG: this W move has to be on 'B' first ("when touched, touch back").

B took 'A' but should have taken 'B' instead considerably stabilizing the top right group, weakening the W stone 'C' and threatening to cut at 'D' if unanswered (see next var).]
(;B[qo]LB[dc:C][lc:L][dd:N][pd:K][rd:G][of:H][qi:D][cj:M][pj:J]
[qj:B][qm:P][eq:F][kq:A][pq:E]C[JUG: This bR5 was not good for B, so W has to take 'B' now.

Tenuki (playing away here on 'A' @L3) is never good if local groups are still weak and the sitation is unsettled.
This lesson is about "take urgent moves before big moves" !!

If in doubt there's a simple set of three questions you should ask yourself:

- 1. Does my opponent have weak groups? ... if yes -> attack them
- 2. Do I have weak groups? ... if yes -> defend them
- 3. Are there big undecided areas? ... if yes -> engage there

If you manage to ask this questions on EACH of your moves, then you don't have weak groups and can concentrate on making big points. Also you don't miss an opportunity to attack. It can be as simple as that ;-)

The "art" of applying this list is to find moves that fulfill more than one purpose: Try to find moves, that not only attack or defend or make territory, but combine multiple purposes in one move. For that you have to be aware of your and your opponents weaknesses and the meaning of moves (like that bR5 is not only a corner enclosure but also an attack on Ws group).

---
For example here:
- (1) Does my opponent (B) have weak groups? -> check every "group" (clockwise) 'C D E F' -> 'C' weak (as shown before), 'D' not particularly weak as there's enough room at the side or the top to make a base or to run to the center (so 3 exits), 'E' have 2 ways to run and is only a single stone (so reasonable stable close to a corner), 'F' is stable as well
- (2) Do I (W) have weak groups? -> check groups (clockwise) 'J P K L M N' -> 'J/P' very close to B and has no base but exit to center (weak, because can come under attack and WAS attacked by Bs last move at bR5), 'K' corner stone (reasonable stable), 'L' has a base (stable), 'N/M' reasonable stable though for 3 stones the distance to 'M' is a bit wide

That means we have Bs weak group at 'C' and a weak W group around 'J/P'. Now is there a move than defend 'J' and do something more (attack something around perhaps like 'D'-group taking away one direction of Bs escape) => move 'B' would stabilize the W group and attack 'D'-group (see next var).]
(;W[kq];B[qk]LB[qj:B][pk:A][kq:C]C[JUG: if B devastates Ws group on the right, then taking the big move at 'C' leaves a bitter taste. Almost always the result is, that your weak groups are getting chased around or your opponent gets a lot of profit while attacking you. Letting that happen is a big no no. That's why the 3-question-list (explained on the previous move) is such a valueable tool to avoid such situations getting into trouble.

B should have taken 'B' instead and not present this hole at 'B'. W should barge in at 'B' first before taking 'A' (see next var).]
(;W[pk];B[ql]LB[pl:B]TR[pm][qm]C[JUG: better answer is at 'B' not at 'A', otherwise B can capture the two marked stones (wQ7 from next move), see also next var]
(;W[pm]C[JUG: this does not work for W];B[pl];W[ol]LB[qj:D]
[ok:B][om:C][rm:A]C[JUG: this leaves two cutting points at 'BC', which B can exploit now (see next vars), though not the best course of action for B as it would leave W with a powerful ponnuki in the center.

As B i would first fix a weakness with 'D'.]
(;B[rm]LB[dg:B][qj:C][cm:A]C[JUG: B should take 'C' instead]
(;W[cm]LB[cd:1][dd:2][ed:3][dh:B][cj:C][qj:A]TR[de][df][dg]
C[this wC7 maybe better around D13?

JUG: Locally wC7 is ok to give 'C' stability.
W at 'B' is looking a bit better than the suggestion at wD13 (a X stone-wall can take a X-space-extension to be relatively stable).
But wD13 is not outright bad (see your next var). It's only, that it would help the 3 stones more which are already strong, than it would give help to the (weaker) lonely 'C'-stone -> give more support to weak stones.

However, the main question always is the same: What is the whole-board situation?
For this, apply the question-list (from move #19) to find weak groups. Only if there are none, big areas should be engaged. -> W still has a weak group with two cuts on the right and there's a nice move at 'A', that can be exploited to stabilize Ws group on the right and attack B at the same time.

This wC7-move is only about a big area, but ends in gote giving the initative back to B.]
;B[hq]LB[co:C][gq:B][mq:A]C[JUG: B at 'A' instead would be better than bH3, because it's an extension from Bs SE-shimari (facing the right direction to the left). Bs SW-shimari would like an extension to the north. Also B at 'A' would most likely be followed by W at H3, which has two W stones with a 2-space-extension away from Bs SW-shimari, which is not a big danger to Bs corner. If W would be around the shimari with only a 1-space-extension from both sides (W at 'BC') the shimari can be invaded.

This is also explained nicely in Yilun Yang's book "Fundamental Principles of Go" (chapter one about openings, but also chapter five about "Invasion and Separation of Some Typical Formations" could be interesting for this).]
;W[nq];B[qn]LB[qd:B][eg:C][qj:D][qm:G][on:A][nq:F][pr:E]TR[rl]
[rn]C[JUG: This bR6 looks like a big move for B (it seems B was a bit afraid about his corner with Ws last move at 'F'), but still 'D' would be better fixing Bs more critical weakness, as bR6 opens up more cutting points (marked), if W barges in at 'D'.
B has some help on the right. If B wouldn't be so strong there, the presence of W at 'FG' indeed could make a W invasion at 'E' possible (also see the mentioned Yilun Yang book "Fundamental Principles of Go", chapter five, page 174).

W at 'B' or 'C' next have some backdraws (see your next vars).]
(;W[on]LB[nm:B][om:A]C[JUG: This wP6 move has the weakness of allowing a B peep at 'B'. Locally it's better to play the more solid move at 'A' (which leaves no weakness).]
;B[ch]LB[ec:D][bf:A][dg:B][eh:C]C[JUG: B is greedy. With the open weakness at 'D' this bC12 is an unreasonable move, that can backfire easily (see next vars).

W is relatively strong here, so can fight. W at 'B' to attack looks promising but is (diagonally) touching a weak stone. So W at 'C' instead looks more playable.]
(;W[bf]LB[eh:A]C[JUG: this leaves an exit open for B with 'A']
;B[bg]LB[dd:F][be:G][cf:A][dg:D][eg:B][ch:H][eh:C][ei:E]C[Not sure about best response here

JUG: that's difficult to tell, because it requires a lot of reading what comes next. Some notes:

- an invasion can either live locally or run out
- what can help in an attack is to be aware of local weaknesses of both players
- If an opponent groups runs out between two groups, often one of the outer groups becomes weaker, because the opponent need only to take care of one group while you need to defend two groups.
- if you attack, try also to give support to the weaker side (which can change during the attack)
- if possible, play a bit away and not too near the opponent as that often leads to making the opponent thick and damaging your other side or own stones

At the moment, Ws 'F'-group looks weaker, so either W at 'D' or 'B' looks good (multi-purpose-move: stay a bit away giving B less to attack, helping W to get out, stabillize Ws weak group). Also Ws game-move at 'A' is playable (just gives less pressure on B). Also 'G' would work as B can't save both groups (corner / 'H'-group, i.e. if you are aware of such weaknesses).]
(;W[cf];B[ff]LB[eh:A]C[JUG: B plays needlessly dangerous for him, jumping out at 'A' would be enough.]

So W kept things simple, otherwise this could ensue in a more complex fight, perhaps starting with 'B' (see next var) as that is a move also B would like to get -> proverb "Play where your opponent wants to play" -> see also http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoProverbs&page=YourOpponentsGoodMoveIsYourGoodMove]

B has the advantage and globally looks around 20-30p ahead: B has almost 3 corners and large influence in the center ('E'-area), which can assure that B and W only get an equal share of the center.

W could take 'C' instead, but then B can enter the corner at 'D' and declare Bs two marked stones at F14 as dispensable (because the corner is bigger than losing 2 stones - even with the rescue of Ws 3 stones at 'F').

W could also attack Bs 'A'-group but it's uncertain if B falls for it: he could also threaten to connect to it from outside resulting in a shared center.

But some more interesting notes about the local situation, if W would not have 'D'.

W next at 'A' (from the game) leaves forcing moves open to exploit by B at 'B'.
Locally better would be W at 'B' (multi-purpose-move), because it (indirectly) captures the B stone at bO16 AND it protects against bM15 (so one ko-threat less).

So a move like bO16 is a "thank-you-move", because it would allow W to fix a weakness.]

[pg][ph][qi]C[JUG: W can still ignore B last move at bO15 and can take sente now, because of 'H' @O19.
It's very important to keep sente in end-game to get the big points for unsettled areas first:

For this analysis each potential move needs to be evaluated (look clockwise), that can gain territory: 'B C D E F G H J K L M'.
Then for each move (or area) you have to check if it will end sente or gote for you or your opponent, and how big they are. To calculate the "value" of a move, you have to compare the two positions of when W plays first and when B plays first in a local area.

This looks like a lot to calculate, but it can be made easier by concentrating on the most obvious double-sente and reverse-sente moves first, because double-gote-moves must be twice as big to be worth taken first. With time and practice this can be done rather quickly (often certain patterns and shape are more familiar).

For the current situation we have:
- B: gote for W, sente for B => reverse-sente (ca. 3p)
- C: gote for W, B at 'N' is sente => reverse-sente (=preventing a sente move by B), follow-up would be sente for W at 'O' @H1 and gote for B (ca. 3p)
- D: gote for W, gote for bB6 as well, though W at 'P' @B4 could work too (but is more complex) => double-gote (6p -> halve to 3p because of gote)
- E: sente for W, gote for B => sente-gote (ca. 2p)
- F: sente for W, gote for bA17 => sente-gote (3p)
- G: sente for W, got e for B => sente-gote (2p)
- H: sente for W, reverse-sente with bM19 -> keep for later (as ko-threat - it's Ws right to play there)
- J: (locally) sente for W, gote for B => sente-gote (4p), but not needed after 'K'
- K: sente for W (but kill ends in gote), gote for B => sente-gote, BUT W at 'K' kills the marked group, so it's about 25p (together with the territory)
- L: sente for W, sente for B => double-sente (ca. 4p); follow-up at 'Q' for W is sente-gote (3p)
- M: sente for W (threatens to capture 'R'), reverse-sente for B => sente-gote (2p)

Then you order the moves by their charateristic and point-value: double-sente first, then reverse-sente or sente-gote moves, then double-gote.
So the best order would be => K L ( J ) G F Q M E D C H B, though after W at 'K' B ends sente taking 'A', and 'J' would not be needed when the stones below are killed.

Put in full example starting with W at 'K' now (see next var) ... and I was surprised that W wins by 8.5p like this (but look at it with a grain of salt and what i said at the beginning about the uncertainty of variations).]

[sr][as][bs][cs][ds][es][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[JUG: *** Summary: ***

The fuseki (opening) of this game ended at moves #20-30: Ws left was a bit too wide and Ws NE-corner was left open while in contrast B had 3 of 4 corners and a tighter defense of the sides while W only had some influence in the center (weakened by some cutting points). So it looks as B had a better start. However, both players missed Bs two big weaknesses (NW-corner originating from a derivation from joseki, and east-side @R11 not protecting against cuts).

W started with high 4th-line stones on the hoshi, but followed with a more territorial style (3rd-line plays) throughout the game. The thinking behind the pincering was ok, but the choice of pincer was not well matched with the other stones on the board (own and opponents), also there would have been easier joseki / pincers.
The choice of joseki must always take the whole-board-situation into account. To make an efficient fuseki you need to utilize the other stones on the board bringing them to work together. If you prefer to play a territorial style, perhaps you should try fuseki with 3-4 openings instead.
Also, Ws and Bs joseki showed some lacking knowledge about the meaning of some joseki-moves. It's near to impossible to know every joseki, therefore it's good to know the principles behind the joseki or at least about some of the joseki-moves.

To improve your fuseki, i recommend the book "Fundamental Principles of Go" by Yilun Yang. It's a very good book to improve your openings, but also helps in middle-game fighting, especially of interest are:
- "Chapter 1: Key Points in the Opening"
- "Chapter 3: Effective Use of Joseki"
- "Chapter 4: Invasion and Reduction"

-----
The middle-game of the game showed, that W was too submissive / defensive in fighting (e.g. move #88, #137). B was sometimes very aggressive and greedy, but often W let B off the hook too easily.

Helpful to know in fights are some basics, but also several (local) tactics like:
- stay strong in a fight (e.g. move #42), it's no good fighting with single stones against a larger group
- do not touch weak stones (it will make them stronger); that means also if you are touched (directly or diagonally), then touch back by hane or extending to make yourself stronger or to create complications (e.g. cross-cut) if you have strong help around
- avoid "thank-you-moves", that helps your opponent more than yourself
- learn the basic dead shapes (vital-points)
- learn to love and embrace ko (when you have enough ko-threats ;-)

In fights, reading (out a situation some moves ahead) is an important skill. It's needed to survive, to kill, to cut, to defend. Often reading 3-4 moves ahead is enough. I dare say, that "reading" is one of the most important skills in Go for all ranks. This will help you not even with fighting in middle-game but also will improve your endgame a lot.
Both players showed, that they did not count the liberties of their groups (see moves #47, #67, #160, #165 for examples). In the game some of these moves were no real threats and could be ignored, therefore wasting a chance to re-get sente.
It's very important to keep sente as long as possible. When a game starts having the first move is considered having a value of 13-15 points (twice the komi normally). This value of moves will decrease throughout the stages of the game (fuseki, chuban) till in yose (end-game) the value of a move is reduced to a few points (around 4-6) till only 1p and finally 0p (when there's nothing to gain any more) and the game is finished. So whoever has sente can get the bigger points.

To improve your reading-abilities you should solve tsumego (go-problems):
- improving in "counting liberties" is best done during your games: before you place a stone count the libs to stay ahead in the counts
- tsumego you can find for example at: http://www.goproblems.com/ or http://senseis.xmp.net/?ProblemsAndExercises (there's also free software to help in studying those)
- seeing and applying throw-ins, snapshots, nets, ladders can also be improved with solving go-problems
- The koreans have an interesting approach when solving tsumego: Their books don't have solution-pages, so you have to convince yourself, that you found the correct solution. This practice can boost your reading-skills even more. This "approach" can be used with any go-problem (just stop yourself from looking at a solution before you are convinced you solved it and explored all variations).

---
You also asked how to avoid getting into trouble. For this the 3-question-list explained at move #19 can be used. This can be a powerful tool to find multi-purpose-moves (with one move attack, defend, secure territory, connect, cut, etc) and identify and play URGENT moves, before taking big moves. It also gives you a way to be aware of your own and your opponents weaknesses.

The following applies for all stages of the game (fuseki, chuban, yose): When taking sente by playing away from a local situation, weaknesses might be left behind. When you do, take a quick reading, IF and WHAT weaknesses you leave behind ("what would i do in my opponents place?"), especially to see if you really want to tenuki. Apply the same, when your opponent tenuki (at where your opponent left the situation). That's sharpening your awareness of weaknesses as well.

Applying this "3-question-list" needs some practice, but helps to avoid getting into trouble and avoid falling back in territory. If you don't have weak groups (that your opponent can attack), you can take the big points.

You have to develop a discipline in your games of not answering right away with the "obvious" move (that is, what the opponent expects you to do). So you have to avoid being the "blind man" lead around by your opponent. Vice versa it's also not a good attitude to expect a certain move from your opponent (e.g. at move #128). Instead find out what's best taking a whole-board-view: "are there stronger sente-moves, bigger moves that your opponent would not ignore, etc. ?" - this moves can be found easier by applying the 3-question-list.

You did a great job pre-analysing your game. The many variations you put in clearly showed that. However, try to avoid wishful thinking (expecting certain moves) in your personal reviews. Stronger players wouldn't fall for such plays (and sometimes it can backfire) ... and you want to beat them in the future, wouldn't you?

By the way, for a GTL-review-request i would expect putting in less variations (concentrate on the ones with the biggest question-marks for you and delete the more obvious ... that makes it clearer for the reviewer and requestor ... too many variations can be overwhelming).

-----
About yose (endgame) you said you are less concerned. I would advice to reconsider that opinion. You may play a good fuseki in 20 games, but then may lose in all of them in the end-game (this can be discouraging ... had such a period myself). End-game is often underestimated, as a LOT can be covered up with a good endgame.
Then again, when you improve your reading-skills it will also help your endgame.

The most important thing about end-game is to be aware of the sente/gote-state and value of each potential move and to find the best order for your side. This analysis should be done early, so you don't miss when chuban (middle-game) is over and yose starts. Also for this the 3-question-list helps.
Try avoiding "obvious" answers only saving one point (or less). Also try to keep sente as long as possible, so you get the big moves first. An example of reasonable end-game for both players was shown in the branch at move #167.


And finally, ... if you don't understand what was going on in one of your games, get some help from stronger players (get us GTL-reviewers something to do ;-)

Hope that review was of some help.

Cheers,

- D: gote for W, gote for bA7 => double-gote (4p => half 2p)
- E: gote for W, gote for B => double-gote (1p)
- F: gote for W, sente for bA5 => reverse-sente (ca. 4p)

- H: sente for W, gote for B => sente-gote (2p)
- K: sente for W, gote for B => sente-gote (1p), but absolute-sente (B wouldn't ignore) -> so can be postponed as the exchanges allows bO9 to be sente
- L: gote for W, sente for B => reverse-sente (1p)
- M: absolute-sente, sente for bM19 (0p in this case) -> so not needed right now
- O: gote for W, sente for B => reverse-sente (ca. 1p)
- P: gote for W, sente for B => reverse-sente (2p)

Sort by double-sente, reverse-sente/sente-gote, gote and point-values. So best order for W => F B G A H D L K P E O M
