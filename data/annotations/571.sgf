C[[Andac\] I submit this game to review because I think that I
avoided the most huge mistakes --- thus the *real* problems of my
playing can be found from the game record. My own comments are
preceded with this [Andac\] prefix.

I think the reason why I won was that my opponent was too eager to
invade and left a lot of weak groups behind. I would like to hear a
comment about that too.];B[pp];W[pd];B[dp];W[ce];B[dc];W[dj]
;B[gd];W[cn];B[cl]LB[fp:A][en:B][jp:C]C[[jasons\] As I mentioned in the email, this was blacks losing
move. I predicted his play for the rest of the game. He played the
Nirensai (two star point) opening. When one plays in this way one
plays for outside influence and power. By invading too early he casts
his influence to the wind. moves at  'A', 'B', or 'C' would be more
consistent.];W[en];B[bo];W[bn]C[[Andac\] I want to (1) split (2) do it in sente. Quite natural, I
think.

[jasons\] yes, your only move.];B[co]LB[el:A]C[[jasons\] bad move for black. B5 was kikashi (forcing move) he
could have afforded to throw it away and take sente elsewhere, such as
'A'.];W[do]C[[Andac\] I thought I would run into problems if I didn't defend
this cutting point, because otherwise b D6, w D7, b D6, w C7 and then
black can enlarge his bottom territory because of the cutting point at
E7. I chose D5 because it's sente (E4 would be very good for me).
[jasons\] yes, as it was, blacks play gives white the perfect move.]
;B[ep];W[ee]LB[fd:A]C[[Andac\] I'm threatening 'A' next.
[jasons\] I'm not so sure that 'A' is big. Remember this is (or ought
to be) the opening. You should be feeling out the other player, seeing
where he's willing to fight, and where's he willing to concede. Things
should be very fluid still. E15 is still an excellent move. It
strengthens your top left group, building power against the lone
invading stone to be used for later.];B[ed]LB[nc:A][qf:B][jp:C]
C[[jasons\] E16 is too small. A play at 'A' , 'B', or 'C'  is much
bigger.];W[fe]C[[Andac\] This is not sente, but I want to defend my territory and
create aji.
[jasons\] yes. black played the contact move, so you can respond
without fear. You get strength for free. Contact plays always
strenghten the other player, this is why they are not attacking moves,
but are instead defensive moves.];B[el];W[gn]
(;B[dk]C[[jasons\] poor move on blacks part. This just strengthens white]
;W[cj];B[ej];W[ei];B[df];W[de]LB[dd:A][cd:B]C[[Andac\] Now black has two weak groups. However, I cannot utilize
that very well in the continuation. I was considering also D16 ('A')
and C16 ('B').
[jasons\] connecting seems correct. Why let black cut you for free?
It is seldom wrong to connect when a peep is made.];B[dh];W[eh]

(;B[eg];W[di];B[fg]C[[jasons\] remember this is  a running game now. Whomever gets
further fastest comes out ahead. Split blacks groups, don't play a
contact play, as this makes black stronger.]
(;W[fj];B[fl];W[hl];B[gk];W[gl];B[gj]
(;W[ch]C[[Andac\] I'm trying to connect.
[jasons\] In general, connecting is what you do when you discover
that you can't live on the outside. In this case it strengthens your
two groups, but it also lets black connect his groups. I think that
you were too easy on him.];B[dg]LB[qf:A][nc:B][jp:C]C[[jasons\] pointless move on blacks part. If he's going to let you
connect he might as well take sente elsewhere with 'A', 'B', or 'C'.]
;W[cg]C[[Andac\] ... And I succeed :)];B[cf];W[bf];B[be];W[bd]
;B[bg];W[ae];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi];W[bj];B[bk];W[ai];B[fh];W[fi]
;B[fk]
(;W[fm]LB[fn:A]C[[Andac\] After this move I thought if F6 ('A') was better... I want
to defend my weak group from being split.
[jasons\] Six of one, half dozen of another. 'A' is stronger, but F7
gives you future eye space.];B[gi];W[ag];B[ck];W[ah]C[[jasons\] black has just thrown away all his ko moves.]
;B[cp]C[[Andac\] Overplay?
[jasons\] It could have been painful later, but you're right it is a
middle game move, and believe it or not we're still in the opening.]
;W[hq]LB[gq:A][gp:B]C[[Andac\] I'm trying to settle the center group. If I didn't play
this, b H4 would probably be very hard to cope with. So I wonder what
had happened if black had played that instead of C4... Actually I
think now that I should have played around H4 directly instead of F7.
[jasons\] I think that you're playing too far away from you're
strength. I think that 'A' or 'B' would have been better. But full
points for getting the right general area. You just want to make sure
that all of your moves have two purposes - both securing your own
groups and threatening blacks. H3 is a little too far from black to be
threatening.];B[gp]C[[jasons\] plus G4 hits you at the critical spot in your shape...]
;W[hp];B[gq]
(;W[jp]LB[ho:A][np:B]C[[Andac\] To defend from 'A'. The center group is big so I cannot
afford putting it into danger.
[jasons\] Hmmm...  You are thick here. I would play 'B' instead,
building your influence.];B[lq]LB[mq:A]C[[jasons\] because your extension was too short you invite black to
extend. In this case I think that black would have been wiser to only
extend to 'A' because of your thickness.]
(;W[nq]C[[Andac\] I think black M3 was a mistake. Now I can effectively
split and M3 is very weak.
[jasons\] yes, but did you consider trading territory for thickness?
You could have effectively walled off the middle and really hurt black
by splitting his two weak groups. I'm not saying you made a bad move,
just that there was another way.];B[np];W[mq];B[oq];W[mp];B[no]

(;W[ln]LB[lp:A][mo:B]C[[jasons\] I think that the correct response here should have been
'A'. it removes all aji and doesn't invite the response of black 'B']
;B[mo];W[lp];B[lo];W[ko];B[pl];W[jd]LB[gh:A]TR[pd]C[[Andac\] I'm now trying to use the bad aji in the weak black top
group.
[jasons\] not only that but it strengthens the cut at 'A' and makes
an excellent extension from the marked stone. Good move!];B[id]
;W[fd];B[fc];W[ge];B[hd]C[[Andac\] After b H16, I could go for a split. I was not sure that I
could get any real profit from chasing G10 group, though, so I decided
to play the next move.]
(;W[jc]LB[if:A]C[[jasons\] I think that K17 ignores the direction of play. You
pressed black and built up thickness in trade for territory at the
top. Now you turn and threaten to take away the territory that you
just gave him. I think that 'A' was the critical point. It completely
cuts off the two weak black groups from escape to the top, allowing
you to either build massive central influence, or possibly kill the
black stones.];B[if]C[[jasons\] instead black plays there.]
;W[hb]LB[gc:A]C[[Andac\] I try to (1) strengthen my small group and (2) to threaten
cut at 'A'.
[jasons\] yes, tactically it is a good move, but the game will be
decided by whehter or not blacks two central groups can suurvive.]

(;B[gb];W[hc];B[gc]
(;W[gg]C[[jasons\] if you can't make the cut, don't eliminate it for
nothing.];B[gh];W[hg];B[ii];W[je]C[[Andac\] I threaten to cut and enlarge my assumed territory.]
;B[hf];W[gf]TR[gg][hg]C[[Andac\] In the view of the later developments, this move was a
huge mistake.
I should have probably played around O16 to get huge lead. I wasn't
able to utilize the cut later.
[jasons\] not so sure. at least you're still keeping him unconnected,
since you played the marked stones, your almost obliged to make them
serve a function.];B[mc];W[oc]C[[Andac\] Now black has created one weak group more, so I try to go
for kill.
[jasons\] Yes, by now you've read him correctly.];B[me]C[
 Andac 9k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[jf];B[ig];W[of]LB[pf:A]
[mg:B]TR[mc][me]C[[Andac\] However, I'm not sure if I can kill so I try to get
territory... it seems I don't know what I'm doing, actually. Probably
simply Q14 ('A') was better --- or something totally else.
[jasons\] P14 exerts more pressure on the marked stones. It also
gives you the good follow-up of 'B'. After that black would really be
in trouble.];B[mg]
(;W[ld]C[[Andac\] However, now my K17 group has suddenly become weak and I
must create some eyespace. That for territory...];B[md];W[lc]
;B[lb];W[kb];B[nb];W[ob];B[qe]C[[Andac\] Again new invasion!]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[oe];B[qg]
(;W[qi]TR[qe][pe][qg]C[[Andac\] Black was threatening to get a huge right side, so I
thought I had no other possibilities than try to invade using the
weakness of the marked group.
[jasons\] no need. he is so weak everywhere, no can breath hard and
he will crumble.];B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[mk]TR[pi][qi]C[[Andac\] Threatening to connect and get center territory. Also,
attacks some of the weak black groups on large scale, or does it?
[jasons\] don't think so. Black is thick and the two marked stones
are weak.];B[oi];W[pk];B[ok];W[ql];B[pm];W[qm];B[qn];W[qh];B[pg]
;W[pj];B[oj];W[rn];B[ro]C[[Andac\] Black calculated the following continuation wrongly I
think.
[jasons\] seems so. It was a good read on you're part, but very
close.];W[qo];B[pn];W[rp];B[rm];W[so];B[qk];W[rl];B[rk];W[sm]
;B[ri];W[rh];B[rg];W[rj]TR[mg][me][md][mc][lb][nb]C[[Andac\] This invasion was a HUGE success for me, I think, as there
is not much territory around L11 anyway and the black wall seems
inefficient.
[jasons\] yes, black's thickness is completely negated by N9. But his
marked stones are now safe...];B[qc]C[[Andac\] Again new invasion! This won't succeed, though.]
;W[rc]LB[sb:A]C[[Andac\] I played this in order to secure one eye near 'A'. I'm not
sure, though, if S16 had been enough.  [jasons\] I think S17 is correct. It removes any nasty aji.]
;B[qb];W[rb];B[kh];W[ib]TR[kh]C[[Andac\] The marked stone removes the eye-making aji I had in the
continuation of w M14, b N14, so I need to get a second eye for the
white group (b J18 were dangerous).];B[ll];W[mm]LB[ol:A][jk:B]
TR[mk]C[[Andac\] I was aiming at the cutting point P8 ('A') and/or saving
the marked stone. I didn't want to give black the center territory
(although there is some invasion aji near 'B' I think, but I could
lose a lot also.)];B[lm];W[mn];B[ml]LB[kn:A]C[[Andac\] I'm not sure if cut at L6 ('A') would work (for black)
instead, probably not.];W[nm];B[nl];W[om];B[on]C[[Andac\] I had overlooked this move and thought I could continue
towards P5 after black connects, or cut if black does not
connect. This, however, prevents the both.];W[km]LB[ol:A]C[[Andac\] So I try to play L7 in sente (threatening 'A') and then
continue with L8 or K9.];B[kl]C[[Andac\] Black mistake? Is the bottom black group alive now?
[jasons\] no, you're correct, black is in trouble. He is so far
behind that he has to try something, though.];W[ol];B[qq];W[rq]
;B[qp];W[po]TR[qn][pl][pm][pn][on]C[[Andac\] Black should probably sacrifice the five marked stones and
play Q2?
[jasons\] yes, I think that with Q2, black lives.]
(;B[oo]LB[ro:A][pr:B]C[[Andac\] The next white move at S5 ('A')  is a huge mistake. After
it black should live (which does not, however, happen). I should play
Q2 ('B') immediately I think. There is a variation in this node.
[jasons\] yes, black's move at P5 is only a false eye, Q2 kills him
dead.]
(;W[ro]LB[pr:A]C[[Andac\] I think the next b move should be Q2 ('A'). (This was not
the move actually played). It seems that black lives very easily.]

for a second eye in the corner.];B[qr];W[nr]C[[Andac\] Now black dies, the next move is unnecessary.]
