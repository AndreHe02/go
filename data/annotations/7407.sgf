C[I went over my game and for the most part I thought my moves were pretty solid.  I'm at a loss as to where to ask for help.

Hi, I am ignus (1k KGS). I will review your game. You will find some general thoughts about your game at the end. I have added a few variations, be sure to check those out.

Let me say at first that you should NEVER be at a loss where to ask for help! Get immediately on the KGS GO SERVER -- www.gokgs.com.  there are specific rooms there for beginners, and for teaching : The Beginners room, and the Go Teaching Ladder. Join those rooms (click on the room menu), and just ask for someone to give you a review or a teaching game. There is usually always someone available, 24/7 !! There is NO REASON to be at a loss where to ask for stronger players to give you a few hints! :D

You will also always be able to find opponents on KGS. A good way of getting stronger is to play a lot on KGS, and to ask stronger players for reviews!]

C[A normal game up to now.];B[lq]C[This is a major mistake by black. The game is still in its early fuseki (opening) stages. It is far too early for an invasion like this.]

(;W[lo]TR[jq]C[This is your first mistake. It is a bad way of responding to the invasion. The marked formation has a weakness at L4. Black can simply escape with his stone by playing there, and your goups will be cut in two. Also, O4 and M5 can be cut (keima shape) from each other. The stone at M5 just doesnt do anything.


A better way of playing is... (see variation)];B[hq]
(;W[jo]C[Black still has the move at K2, so this move is dubious.]

(;B[eq]C[Now black has the opportunity to make a base for his group, and take away your potential for expansion from the C4 stone. Black now has a solid group. You missed an important opportunity here, and let black settle too easily.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[ir]C[J2 wasn't really needed, was it?

--

J2 is a very good move!

It prevents the black move at K3 and kills the M3 stone completely. Moreover, it attacks the black group at E3, by threatening to take away its base! Good  move! Makes territory AND attacks. These are the kinds of move you want to play in Go -- ones which have more than one purpose.]
;B[co];W[bo];B[dp];W[cq];B[cn];W[er];B[fr];W[dr];B[bn]
(;W[ao]C[This descent to the first line is usually bad. Black now has the A6 move in sente. (IF you want to play endgame here, B4 is the move.)

Moreover, this is FAR too small to be played now. You should ignore B6 and play tenuki (elsewhere). The game is still in its opening stages! This is a move for the endgame, which is not even in sight yet. Your group is not in danger, so you dont need to play here!]
;B[an]C[Black gets this move for free.];W[bq];B[dj]C[... and black gets a major opening point. Just look at the framework created by  D17, D10 and the wall C6! Realize that you GAVE that to black, in return for a move on the first line, A5 :[ Black has the potential to make 40 points on the side, and you made 9 point in the corner, and your corner group does not participate in the game anymore, while blacks framework will be the focus of attention throughout the middle game :[]

(;W[jc]C[This kind of move is used when you want to reduce the side. Black can attack this stone easily, and build a large framework. It is better to approact either corner. Rememer, play in the corners first, and then on the sides, and finally in the center (this is an important order of playing to remember).]

(;B[mc]C[This is also a good move by black.];W[gc];B[ce]C[:\] The same thing happened in the game as I showed in my variation.

Look, black got a lot of points both around R17, and C17. And what did you get? Maybe 8 points (with luck) at J18. You have a small group, and black got two shimaries (corner enclosures), worth about more than 30 points! And your group can even be pressured and attacked still :[]

(;W[ed]C[This is a bad move. You just INVITE black tro play a simple defensive move, D16. this will solidify his territory in the corner, and what will you get out of it? Nothing.]

;B[gf];W[me];B[ld];W[le];B[nd];W[ke]C[This whole sequence is bad for you. Your group is not making any points, not attacking anything, and you only solidified black's position. You got nothing out of it.]
;B[qh]C[Black comes out in sente and takes a big point yet again. Now the game is very hard for white. Just look at the board. Black has stones all over the place, and you played only on the bottom and on the top.]

(;W[rd]C[Was this invasion too aggressive?

--

At this point you need what you can get desperately, so no, it is not too agressive. You should have played here earlier, it is actually a common invasive move. You could have played here instead of the whole sequence starting with D16.

However, the problem is now that black will simply confine you to the corner and take the outside.]
;B[qc]
(;W[rc]C[Ouch! Crawling on the second line! Very bad.];B[rf]
;W[qb]C[You don't want to just live in the corner... If black encloses you, the game will be over. His outside influence will be too big.

Moreover, making eyes here is not easy and maybe even impossible.]
;B[pb];W[qa];B[pa];W[qd];B[pc];W[sb];B[ra];W[rb]
(;B[qe];W[sd]C[Well. You have a total of 4 points in the corner. How much do you think black will make around O18 and S11 ? The invasion turned out to be a disaster for white. You should have run away into the center, destroying blacks potential territory.]
;B[oe];W[ch]C[Good point to invade.];B[ci];W[eh]C[Good move. Lightly jumping away to the center is what you want to do , when you're reducing your opponents territory.]
;B[gh];W[fg]C[Nice, you connected :\]];B[gg];W[om]C[Good move, if black plays around this area he can make a large framework. Your only chance to catch up with him in points is to make territory in the center, and this move helps you with that.]

[sm][sn]C[General thoughts about the game:
--

You made a few endgame mistakes, which made you lose the game, but I feel that what happened in the opening is more important to understand, if you want to improve. You played unnecessary local moves, and failed to play in the large areas and big points in the board. Remember that at the beginning of the game you want to create a loose "sketch" of a potential territory-framework. If a move is not necessary - that is, if a group of yours cannot be attacked  -  then you should play in a large point. You played moves that were not necessary (your groups were not weak), and let your opponent take the big points. See the comments regarding moves A5 and K17.

The order of play is (this is very important):

1) Do you have weak groups? Can a group be attacked by the opponent? Defend!

2) Does the opponent have weak groups? If so, attack!

3) No weak groups on the board? Play a LARGE MOVE, one of the big points on the board.

It is absolutely essential for you to STICK to this order of play!

The rest of your mistakes just come down to reading skill and practice in recognizing what a good move is in certain shapes and positions. The only way to learn that is to play a lot and do go problems :\]

If you have any questions about this review, you can send me a message on KGS, my nickname is "ignus", or email to the address I sent you this review from. I am also always available for a review or a game, so don't hesitate to ask!

I hope this review helped you and was reasonably clear. Take care!]
