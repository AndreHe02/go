Thank you for reviewing this game! I really apppreciate your time.

I won this game by 0.5 point. However, I feel that I should have done much better. I played fairly freely in the opening, without much reading, and I tried to do what my intuition told me due to the nature of the handicap.

I'm very interested in any comments you have, and I've also included many questions throughout this game that you can hopefully comment on.

Thanks!

;B[pf];W[qg]
(;B[qj]LB[qi:a]C[Better at A? I wanted to play a little looser in order to emphasize the relationship with my star point stone at Q4.

a would be close.

i think you should just view q14 r14 as a good exchange and now answer c14.]

(;B[oj]C[This move felt good.

it's ok, but with the UL sitting there unfinished you can always play f17 or so and be ok.]
;W[nh]
(;B[eq]LB[md:b][hq:a]C[Better choice somewhere else? A, B?

first move in UL is bigger than this.

this is really not such a good move since it doesn't finish the corner.

if you at trying to stop him sliding at d2, you shouldn't.  if he f4 now then you've made him stronger, and if he gets alive on the outside he can invade your corner.]
;W[bm]
(;B[fp]C[Same reasoning as before.

but this b shape is not that great.  f2 would be the way to really make w's stone useless and help the corner.]
;W[gq]
(;B[iq]C[Trying to be tighter here just for variety. :)

f4 g3 is a great exchange for you.  you don't need to kill to gain from it, you've already gained.  after g3 i would not play so close to them.]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[ho];B[lp]CR[ho][hp][ip][fq][gq][iq]MA[qf][qg]
[nh][ph][oj][qj]C[Which exchange was better?

those were not the exchanges... the exchanges were r15 and q14 for c14 and r13

p10 and r10 are ok, not really that great stones.  i'd rather have p10 at f17

In LL, b has no pts in the corner, right?  so he basically got m4 and didn't answer b7.  that is ok, i think, except in a handi game w should easily invade LR, where the q4 stone is looking lonely.]

(;W[qn]C[I don't think I handled this invasion well.  Please comment on the next several moves.]
;B[qp]C[Going for territory...

not just terr... taking away eyespace];W[np]C[My opponent thought for awhile before making this move.  And apparently it was the right one for him since I did not handle it well.

In the game he got a wall going up from o4.  i would try to close him in, maybe give up some side points.

All this happened because b built walls around a weak 4-4 stone.]

(;B[on]C[Trying to split him...

this looks kind of funny.];W[oo]
(;B[po]C[this is NOT good shape.  empty triangle

plus, if he q6 then p6 stone needs defending.  you should definitely play the other way.]

(;W[nn]
(;B[pn]C[too slow!  what're you scared of, that he'd cut here after you p7?]
;W[nm]
(;B[pl]C[After playing this move, I felt overconcentrated and ashamed for having connected so slowly.  Alternatives?

yeah, it looks a bit heavy.

keep in mind that n10 is really good for B, splitting and threatening two white groups.  so p10 r10 aren't in such a bad state really.  if b plays nothing here can w really cut them?

hmm, maybe w can cut them.  but not kill them directly.

at this point i would play n10 for b and let w cut them.  he won't get any eyes around there anyway, and once b is out at n10 he can run easily since extending will be an attack.]
;W[jn]C[W trying to seal me in...];B[ln]C[I resist....];W[lm]
C[Hmm, didn't see a way to cut through without damaging myself, so I went for eye space.]

(;B[kn]C[d's always criticize this kind of move.  it's butting into his stone.  afterwards b's stones are still bad.

b needs to exploit p5 being in the wrong place.];W[km];B[io]
C[this doesn't help.  b has aji to live here, no need to make w strong on the outside and live inside.]
;W[in];B[hn]C[funny.  what if w just pushes up and then connects?]

;W[jd];B[ke]MA[qf][qg][nh][ph]C[My idea with this move is to begin a leaning attack on this W group.

hmm.  5th line shoulder hits may not be that useful.  if w l16 now then b's stone isn't that useful.]

(;B[ne];W[qc];B[lh]MA[qf][qg][nh][ph]C[I was eager to play this move since it countered W's center thickness and sealed the marked group in.

;W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[ec]

yeah, this didn't work that well.];B[hj]C[Time to reduce.  At this point, I think W should begin to cut me up and attack in the upper right, making use of what thickness he still has in the center.

this seems good.  w lost a lot in the next few moves.  although maybe he never really had it anyway.]

I forgot about R2 and had some additional slip-ups in the endgame.  I was lucky to have won.

End of my game comments.

What would you say are the main things for me to study/improve on?

Thank you!

BruceWayne

i think you are underestimating the value of getting out.  you ended up having to play so many moves to make life for the bottom middle group, because you never exploited p5.

h10 ended up working pretty well.

you missed a couple of w connections, which hurt a lot.

you played a couple of knights moves which didn't end up working that well.

improving your reading would have helped a lot on the bottom]
