C[This was part of a serious team match i played in. I win the game by resignation after making a large kill, but I am curious if my attack was reasonable or an overplay among other things.

I played white.
This game was played on the KGS go server.

(;B[cg]C[This move is good in that it develops a large side. However, it doesn't have a good relationship with the other stones. From the bottom, a 3 space extension is most efficient, and from the top stone, a shimari is better. White will have an easier time invading here than if black had made one of these extensions.

Giving up P16 isn't a bad plan, but black should threaten to pull it out immediately before developing in this way - see variation.]

Counting at this point is a great idea.

White has:

Lower left: 9
Lower right: 22
top right: 18
top left:13
Total: 62 + 6.5 = 68.5

Black:

Bottom: 6
Right: 6
Left: 64

Total: 76

But it is white's move. 

I don't think this invasion should work. So really the "safe" move would be to reduce black in sente, starting at B6, for example.]

;B[gn];W[rm]C[I am curious if this was a reasonable ko threat. my rational was that this group is dead unless black responds. (black ignores and i kill the group). my main reason for submitting a review is because I am unsure if trying to kill is reasonable.
In addition after the game my opponent says "I lose semeai" I would also like to know what semeai he was refering too.

*********
 White didn't really lose anything by invading on the left, and so perhaps white might try to get some more points elsewhere in a less risky way. For example, B16 is fairly big, as is P15 (as a Ko threat). Both are worth on the order of 10-15 pts. We counted the left as being worth 64 pts for black before. After this capture its worth still only 67!

Playing through some possibilities, my conclusion is that this Ko threat actually doesn't work - the group can get two eyes. However, for this to be done without ruinous consequence, black needed to end the ko connecting at G7, not taking at F5. The weakness around L8 in white's wall permits black to get a second eye. When black took at F5, that was black's losing move.

I am also a bit confused about the semeai comment. Perhaps he was referring to the battle between the J7 and G9 groups which resulted in the Ko.]

C[Black resigns.

**********
Overall, it seems to me that White deserves this win. Black made many mistakes when white invaded. Overall, black's game was more confused than white's. White's moves generally made sense, though at times they were a bit slow.

White's biggest mistakes were as follows:

Move 20 C5 - This move was pretty unnecessary, and basically was a wasted move.
Move 28 J17 - Extending and inviting black to cut through was not a good idea.
Move 34 K17 - J18, connecting in both directions would have saved a move, and shut down the possibility of black sealing off F17.
Move 93 N10 - Peeping here instead of the cut was a big lost opportunity. In the resultant scramble that black would have had to do, white would have had good opportunities to benefit.

Hope you find these comments helpful.
