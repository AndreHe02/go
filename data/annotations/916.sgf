;B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[nq]LB[or:a]C[The normal joseki move is at A. The reason becomes obvious with Black's next move.]
;B[rr]LB[or:a]TR[qr]C[Black S2 ensures one eye in the corner for Black without losing sente.   White has to answer Black S2 because otherwise Black would capture White's marked stone and get an easy life in the corner.

If White had played the joseki move at A he could ignore Black's S2 and play elsewhere.]
;W[pr];B[pm]LB[on:a][qk:b][jq:c]C[Q7 is a contact move. As a rule, playing contact moves makes your opponent's position stronger. Contact moves force the opponent to respond in a way which makes his positions safer.

The move at A is a lot better. It avoids making contact. Except this, it makes Black's group safer by running out into the center. And it's an attacking move because it has nice follow-ups at B or C.]
;W[pl];B[qn];W[rm];B[ol];W[pk]TR[pm]LB[sp:a][om:b]C[Now this shows beautifully what I said about the contact move (marked stone).

White's group on the right side is now strong and safe and works beautifully with White's stone in the upper right corner.   Except that, Black's group is still weak. White can take away the space for eyes in the corner with A. And there is also the cut at B.]
;B[ok]LB[om:a]C[Again this move strengthens only White's right side. Simply connecting at A is the right move here because it saves Black's group and avoids strengthening White.]
;W[oj];B[dj]LB[jq:a][nc:b]C[I think it is a little late to play sanren-sei.

Sanren-sei follows a moyo strategy where it is very important to extend from the sanren-sei along the sides and towards the center.

Although, White has a very strong right side with big influence radiating towards the center. Except that, Black's group in the lower right corner is weak. White can chase it around and during this chase White will spoil all prospects for Black in the center.

I would rather play at A or B.];W[fd];B[df];W[id];B[nc]LB[qf:a]
[nd:b][pj:c]C[I would play at A here.   It is clear that W will answer B O17 with the attachment at B which enlarges the right side even more.

Black at A is a bit risky because it's deep in the enemy's territory. But it may have more chances in a fight because of White's weakness at C.]
;W[nd];B[pc];W[od];B[oc];W[mc];B[qd];W[qe];B[rd];W[re]C[It's clear here that White gained a lot more than Black in this fight. White's right side is done. And the top, too.]
;B[nj];W[oi];B[mb];W[lc];B[lb];W[ni];B[ge]TR[nj][lb][nq][pq]
[pr][qr]LB[kc:a][nk:b][jq:c]C[The last three moves by Black (marked stones) only served White.   All these moves forced White to answer and through answering White strengthened his positions without giving Black much in return.

M18 is still more or less okay. W should have answered at A. But O10 is definitely bad as it made White very strong (triangle shape) and produced another cutting point at B.

At this point Black should better think about a move at the bottom around C. This area is almost unoccupied which means that both players have some interest here.]
;W[gd];B[jf];W[nk];B[nl];W[mj]C[Capturing this lonely stone is small. The bottom is still open.]
;B[lh]LB[kc:a]TR[jf]C[This is the kind of move where you can easily see that it is not very efficient. Just imagine what the situation would be if White played there.

There is not much difference! Black already has his marked stone in this area. And there is also A as a possible big move for Black at the top.]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[he];B[hg];W[kq]LB[fq:a][jp:b][mo:c]C[This move is slow. White should take into consideration that Black's group in the corner is very weak. So he can gain more by attacking.

White can choose what he wants to do first: attack (around C) or develop along the side (A, B). Both strategies are possible here.]
;B[iq]C[Good response. But be aware of your right corner.];W[fq]
;B[dr];W[go];B[io];W[ko];B[im];W[cq];B[dq];W[co]TR[fq][go]C[In the following battle Black should aim at capturing the two white marked stones on a big scale.]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[bq];W[cl]LB[en:a]C[One of the best and easiest to follow strategies in Go is 'to cut and to connect'.

A move at A now keeps the both white groups seperated. White will have to choose which one to defend and which to abandon.

At the same time, White will win this local battle if he simply manages to connect his both groups.]
;B[bo];W[bn];B[ap];W[do]LB[eo:a]C[Black can still cut here at A.]
;B[ck]C[Another contact move which results in a stronger position for White.]
;W[dl];B[kn]LB[fk:a]TR[fq][go]C[This move is dangerous. It is again a contact move which makes White stronger in relation to the black group on the right. It is better to avoid playing in this direction.

I would play something like A here. This builds a moyo in the upper center, and the two marked white stones can still be cut off.]
;W[ln];B[lm];W[km];B[jn];W[mm];B[lo];W[ll]LB[mn:a]C[Simply connecting at A is better.]
;B[mn]LB[nn:a]C[Black must think about his corner and not about one stone.]
;W[nn];B[lm];W[om]LB[no:a]C[This move is worth only 8 pts. A cuts off Black's corner, connects White's groups and threatens to kill the whole corner.]
;B[rn];W[pn]C[This is only one captured stone. Very small.]
;B[ln];W[ep];B[no];W[cc]LB[dc:a][kc:b]TR[fd][gd][he][id]C[This move is too bold. It puts White's marked group into big danger. As played in the game, Black will first block at A and White has to struggle to survive in the corner. Then Black has B.

White should attach at A instead.];B[dc];W[bd];B[be];W[bb];B[cd]

C[Why not cut at A?];B[kd];W[md];B[mf];W[of];B[se];W[sf];B[sd]
;W[qf];B[fe]LB[ec:a]C[I would connect at A here. It is difficult to say if Black can really kill White's group. But still the fight will be in favor for Black.]
;W[ec];B[fk];W[bk];B[bj];W[bl]C[This is a small move. It saves White only a couple of points while he loses sente.]
;B[kl]C[This is also small and gives away sente. Consider attacking White's bottom group.]
;W[kk];B[jl];W[ki]TR[km]C[Black captured the marked white stone and allowed White to enter his moyo.]
;B[ii];W[fm];B[jc];W[ib];B[ic];W[hc];B[gr];W[fr];B[op]LB[oo:a]
C[Very good.

White could have cut at A with a possible bad outcome for Black.]

;B[qo];W[js];B[is];W[ks];B[ie];W[me];B[if];W[hd];B[jd];C[As a summary I would like to give you the following advice.

1. Avoid playing moves which make your opponent stronger, especially contact moves. When you play a move which forces your opponent to respond in a particular way try to imagine what the situation will look like after the exchange and who benefits from it more.

2. Try to keep your opponent's groups seperated and try to connect your own groups.

3. Learn to use and *keep* sente.])
