AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, I'm Black playing in a 2 stone handicap game against the computer program Crazy Stone 2012.  I'm not sure where I went wrong in this game and suspect I've made many tiny errors instead of one or two big errors.  I would appreciate any specific or general advice about my play.]

C[I played this high 1 point jump because I thought it worked well with the stones in the top right.

***
This is a fine move. The cut of f16 is big, but not urgent. Even after the cut White can settle his stones. (See variation)]
(;W[jp];B[fd]LB[cj:A][cn:B]C[While this is big, defending your left side is also important. when you play d6, you should either have a very good plan for what do do when you tenuki, or you should defend. If you feel like defending on the left is slow, then play d6 ant c6 instead. See variations.]
(;W[cl]C[How to deal with this. This is a problem worth a lot of thinking. It is certainly not unplayable for Black to tenuki, and this situation is by no means game over for Black. We can look at this position in a variation. (See variation)]
(;B[cj]C[The variation for move 11 discusses this move in more detail, but the main thing to remember is that C10 is slightly easier for White to counter attack than C11 would have been. Since your top left is so thck, this should nto be much of a concern, though the aji left with e16 needs to be considered.]
;W[el]
(;B[go]LB[fn:A]C[I'm not sure if this is the correct strategy.  I did not want to let my stones be cut off from the center, but already feel that I'm not making enough territory.

***
Lets talk territory. It is hard to get a very good idea how territory will break down, but you can make good estimates to guide you. The top left will definitely be Black's territory, and already it is about 10 points. The bottom left will likely be Black's, but this is a dynamic position and lots could happen. The top right now is un decided, but g17 for White gets him a small (5 point) position, and the Black extension to f15 solves a lot of aji problems. If Black gets there he will have over 15 points on the top. the top right and bottom right corner are equal, so it is really just a contest between White;s bottom and your left and top. Seems like Black is doing fine.

More important though that territory though is settling the weak groups. White has a weak group at C8, Black's corner is unsettled. As such this is a good move, threatening White's group, depriving it of a friendly group to run too, and strengthening your own unsettled group.

Even more common in this situation though is Black A. Because White is attacked so tightly by C10, you want to keep the pressure up as strongly as possible, keeping your bottom as strong as you can. See variation.]
;W[gm]C[Interesting move, poking at the thiness of  your shape.]
;B[gq]LB[gl:B][fn:A][hn:C]C[I was hoping that by attacking here, I might gain some thickness to attack the rest of white's stones.

[qr][gs]C[I resigned because I was behind on territory.

You are a little behind, but lets take a look at what is left. Keep in mind SE is counting D5 as dead.

Black has 22 in the top left, 21 top right, 3 bottom, 46 points total.
White has 11 bottom right, 8 right, 50 middle, 69 points total. 

If you were playing someone worse than you, 23 points would be possible. Hard to believe a computer would make a mistake like that.]
;C[Conclusion:

1) Main points from the opening:
    A) Do not worry about territory when there are weak groups.
    B) There are often many ways. Look at the individual board position and try to come up with a plan that           takes as much as possible into account
2) Middle Game:
     A) Timing of moves like peeps makes a difference
     B) Do not always play the first most obvious reply to a forcing move
     C) Play on the pivot point between two moyo.
3) Endgame:
     A) Do not get greedy
     B) Always count.])

(;AB[fn]C[The situation starts getting very complex here, but here are the main things to consider:

1) White's primary goal is to counter attack the single Black stone to build strength. This is most commonly done by E10 or D11.

2) White also would like to get b6 for some safety. As such, Black would like to get c7 to prevent it.

3) Black can build his shape by attaching to F3, building a flexible shape. Black can get safe by playing d2 or d3 as well.

Attached are the next few moves of several professional games. The important thing to look at is the development of White in the bottom right and Black's shape in the top left!]

Here Black has a ton of options. These have all been played in pro games, and they are all in games where there were no previous moves in the square showed by the moves. While it is a little overwhelming, it is clear to see 3 trends:
1: attack stone A.
2: attack stone B.
3: jump inbetween the two. 
(It is important to note that l, q, s, w, E and B are all played by White when Black plays tenuki again!)]

[kp:q][lp:p][hq:g][lq:f][dr:o]C[Here are the options again. A lot fewer, and there is only really one main idea:
1) Attack C8.

This can be done several ways though. the e/m/a/b/c/w block shows the direct pincer, the most common way. 

The q/p/f block is a special circumstance when Black has a very powerful bottom right, and attacking the bottom is reasonable.

n/v are clearly more involved middle game situations.

d/t/s/l/x are only White follow ups if Black tenuki's yet again.

The interesting set of moves is j/h/r/i/g/u. These are following the advice "feint on the east to attak on the west" The goal is not to launch an attack against the bottom (unless White is super nice), but instead is building up additional strength before deciding how to pincer the stone. 

K is special, in that is like before. You could attack the bottom (meaning your bottom left needs to be quite strong), or the D8 stone.


**Important consideration for your game: the difference between [a\] and [b\]. B is closer, and as such is a stronger attack. The problem with a stronger attack is that it puts more pressure back on your two corner stones and your pincer stone. Most often Black will have a thick position in the top left to play B. A is a slightly weaker attack, but it is much harder for White to counter attack, making it the favorite.]
