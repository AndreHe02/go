AB[pd][dp]PL[W];W[qp];B[dc];W[de];B[fd]C[I feel my selection of joseki here was horrible.  I'm thinking c16 or c15 would have been much better. and then checking on whichever side white extends to utilize my star point stones well.  Also, pincering immediately seems reasonable.  I feel I probably picked the worst joseki here.


F16 is fine!];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd]
(;B[eb];W[ci]C[L17 is a decent idea, but I find that extending from that particular joseki in top left is usually not so productive. A few other ideas:]

(;B[kc];W[cn]C[I really had no idea what to do with this.  Which is probably the main reason I ignored it to take another big point]
;B[qj]C[I think this was a big mistake of mine right here.  I'm thinking g3 looks much better.

G3, F3 would be much more solid, true. Probably better idea, then you can aim at C8 etc]

(;B[fm]C[I considered this move for a long time.  By every sequence I look at playing d8 has my group running into the center and white getting the entire bottom as territory, but losing sente here was really big.

This move was quite unhappy!  Maybe it's the losing move. I've made a few alternative branches (mostly before, at joseki selection time)]

(;B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[qm]C[I finally have sente, but I figure I'm way behind in territory.  In retrospect.  Invading all over the board would have been a good plan since I am so thick, but lessons learned.

Your choice of 3x3 gave up sente. I'll go back to show an alternate path... But besides that, the direction you blocked in probably isn't optimal. (Support for another wallis in top left... But you blocked so your wall faces bottom,where white is built up.)]

(;B[eg]C[I knew that this left behid the cut at f15, but I was willing to sacrifice e13 to seal off the center if he cut before I defended

The cut is too much.];W[cg];B[nj]C[I think I should have been more ambitious here.  Tengen looks nice, but I still feel pretty behind at this point.]
;W[li]
(;B[mh]C[I really had no idea what to do here.

Defending like this is toothless.];W[lh];B[lg]C[I knew the standard replay was n13, but I felt that I could afford to be mroe aggressive having a solid wall behind me and I didn't want it to be easy for white to settle.]
;W[kg]
(;B[ji]C[I planned on probably sacrificing this stone, but I probably should have just cut here.  I didn't want to give white a ladder break move against my group on the bottom left.
