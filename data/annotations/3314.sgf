C[
I played black in this game. I feel I came out of the opening with a good lead, but couldn't hold onto it. My opponent succeeded in invading my territory, but I couldn't invade his successfully. What could I have done better?

A: I will precede my comments with "A:" so you know it is me.

A: I am writing this after reviewing the whole game and have left comments throughout.  As a general matter, you played fine for your level and showed ample fighting spirit.  Just practice and study.  Particular points to watch: 1. In the opening, push from your weak stones toward your strong. 2. Don't touch weak stones; pen them in but keep well back and let them die on their own. 3. Don't always try to kill groups, sometimes just pen them in.  and 4. If you are going to try to kill a group, make sure it is penned in first.  Even if it lives because you give it the chance to make eyes, by penning it in, you usually win the exchange anyway.

All the best,

Andy];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[qk];W[cj];B[jd]C[A: E3 would be bigger I think, denying him an easy corner enclosure and lots of unchallenged territory.]
;W[jq];B[eq]C[Was this invasion premature? Should I have made kakari at F17 or similar point?

A: Perhaps (although playing E3 the previous turn would have been better.)  Since you have been playing a very calm opening, perhaps you should have continued with an approach to the upper left or finishing your lower right corner with R5 or started making a moyo with K10 or M4 or something like that.  Since K3 was in place your stone at E3 was going, inevitably, to get chased around, so perhaps these other moves would have been better at this stage.]
;W[ep];B[hq]C[A: Not great.  The two space extension gives enough area for life if white is not too close but the stone at E4 is too close.]
;W[fq];B[fr];W[er];B[gq];W[dq];B[fp];W[eq]C[A: This exchange was not good for you, giving white the corner and your own stones riven by two glaring cutting points and hampered by the k3 stone.  F4 is only of interest if white takes the bait and goes for a ko fight.  I don't happen to agree with the proverb that there is no ko early in the game, but people rarely actually get into ko fights this early.]
;B[hr];W[jp];B[fo];W[nq];B[oo]C[A: A good move locally to threaten white and build up your own stones, but your group on the left is as yet eyeless and quite vulnerable.  Perhaps H5 would be a better move here, giving you a much stronger group facing the center.]
;W[np];B[no];W[mo];B[mn]C[A: An excellent sequence of moves by you to build up a moyo. White had the ideal extension of a stone three spaces from a two stone group.  Now it is lumpy.]
;W[lo];B[lq]C[A: Bold, but a bit ambitious.  When you try to kill a group outright and fail, it usually ends up stronger and you lose on the deal. White here has a large internal space, though your stone makes it hard to divide, and an escape route to the center.  Don't forget that one of the groups that is hemming in the white group is itself very weak.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[mr];B[jr];W[kq];B[nm]C[A: White's group is now strong.  Your moves along the edge, though costing white territory, are endgame moves.  You could have reduced as well later with a monkey jump to L1 or a stone at M2.  Meanwhile, there are other bigger fish to fry, like expanding your moyo and constraining his stones.  On that point, I think you could get away with M6 here.  You win the ladder handily if he cuts.]
;W[qf]C[A: You let white get away with a lot in this invasion.  It may not be possible to kill, but it might be possible to limit him severely.  In this instance, there are a few factors to consider. One is that R9, backed up by your dominance of the lower right, is a strong stone, while your star point stone in the corner remains weak.  When responding to invasions, better to shove from the weak side, strengthening your weaker stones and pushing the opponent toward your stronger.  More specifically, as you may have encountered in handicap games or discussions of handicap games, responding to a knight's move kakari with an attachment (in this case at R15) is sound when there is a stone already on or near the nearest star point (in this case Q10).  White usually has to respond with Q14 to stop you from making a tiger's mouth by playing there.  Then you can play O16 and do well in the corner, while white does not have room to extend efficiently. Lastly, consider the general principle that the corner is more valuable than the side.  If the attachment seems wrong, consider just R16.  White must R11 and you can O17.  All very calm and to your advantage, certainly compared to what happened.]
;B[qh];W[qd];B[qc];W[qe]C[A: I would be tempted to play at S17 here, keeping the corner and challenging white to make a base.  See variation.]

(;B[oc];W[qg]C[A: Still S17.];B[oh];W[rc];B[qb];W[rh];B[qi]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[rb];B[fc];W[fd];B[dc]C[A: C17 would be more valuable here I think.  You would get the whole corner, since white could not afford to play D17 and let you wreck his development prospects on the whole left side.]

;W[gh];B[bl]C[Is this an invasion I should have saved for the endgame?

A:  Yes.  It would seem to rob white of 7 points of territory, which is big in the end-game, falling between the usual 4 point edge hane and the 10-point monkey jump, both considered end-game. If you were going to be doing end-game, by the way, I think C18 (C16 maybe?) is a lot more valuable.  But it is middle game still and things like H15 are much more significant.  Also, consider P2.  Your stone at M3 has a bit of aji and it could be used to good effect.  If you play at P2, it is sente, since a follow up at M4 would reduce the now strongly surrounded group to one eye.  Meanwhile P2 secures the corner and is worth tidy bit in territory.]
;W[cl];B[am];W[bk];B[al];W[ak];B[an];W[bo];B[fm];W[ao];B[dn]
;W[qn]C[I had been thinking of playing at R5 in gote to stop an invasion. Was that necessary or could I have prevented this invasion from succeeding?

A: My first guess would be that this invasion would have a hard time living.  About its only hope is pushing at P4 and cutting at Q5.  For that reason, my response would probably have been Q4 or P4, to stay connected.  I would venture to say that R5 in gote would be a wasted move.]
;B[qo]C[A: Never touch a weak stone.  It gets stronger.  Note that when white hanes at S5, you refuse the right, pulling back to R4 to keep your stone strong.  It is exactly why not to touch weak stones.  Had you played this stone at S4, white could have done nothing in that direction to make you hesitate or pull back.]
;W[ro];B[qp];W[rp];B[rq]C[A: Now white has a fighting chance at an eye, though he is at least constrained from further movement toward the corner.]
;W[rl]
(;B[ql];W[qm];B[rm]C[A: If you assume that white will get no other eye-space away from the edge, then white has a 5 point dead eye-space.  Learn to recognize these.  The vital point is T6.  Alternatively, Play S9, cutting off any interference from above and threatening S7. If he plays at S7, then T6 is, again, the vital point.]
;W[rn];B[sm];W[sl];B[sp];W[so]C[A: Ok, still only one eye, as long as he doesn't get out.]

(;B[sk]C[A: I think this is an unnecessary move.  See variations.]
;W[sn];B[sq]C[A: Another unnecessary move, but this one is more important. This is something that arises in life-and-death situations and you must learn to recognize.  This small white group is one you are trying to kill outright.  It is struggling for life and can only get it by getting two eyes.  If white plays at T3, taking T4, it is a false eye and there is no true eye to be had in the corner.  If white plays T3, you yawn and play S2; the game is unaffected.  P8, not touching the white stones but guaranteeing no room for a second eye, is your move.]
;W[rk];B[sj];W[pl]C[I succeeded in stopping him from forming two eyes, but could I have played this better to stop him from escaping? The problem is my stones around R10 are in danger

A:  They're not in that much danger, and yes you can have stopped him from escaping.  See variations in a couple of moves.]
;B[pk];W[ol]C[A: Of the variations, just cutting here are Q7 seems best.]

C[I knew at this point I had to hold white to a small territory if I was going to have any chance of winning]
;B[ld]C[A: Don't touch weak stones.  They get stronger. Consider K18 forcing white out or M13, cutting off escape.]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[jb];B[mb];W[lb]C[would N17 have been the right move here?

A: Might have worked.  All the paths I went through here from N17 work out well for black.]

(;B[ka]C[A: A nice place for an attacking stone, but you need to pen him in before the coup.  You need to bomb his railyards before landing on the beaches.]
;W[ib];B[hc];W[la];B[kc]C[A: N17 is still good.];W[kb]C[A: I don't think you need to connect at L16.]
;B[kd];W[hb];B[gb];W[mc];B[nb];W[nd];B[pe];W[nf];B[md]C[A: You can't disconnect N17 from O16, and in trying you weakened your corner stones.  Q14 might have worked out better.  White still has trouble connecting out and still has just the one eye.]

;W[na]C[At this point the game was pretty much over for me, but I continued to try invasions out of desperation. I didn't succeed, but are there any places I could have?

A: No.  I am of the opinion that continuing to play in such circumstances is good, especially for newer players, because you learn things and you never know what might happen.  But I can't see a plausible plan for winning this game.  All his groups are strong and while you still have valuable moves (C16-18?) none comes close to getting you the territory you need.  The survival of his group at the top finished you off.]
