C[I thank you for your review in advance. I have 7 questions for you. If you see any other bigger!! mistakes, please tell me. Please do only review for Black.

Have fun^^.

[kb\]: Interesting game to review!  You have a couple of strategic direction of play issues, but other than that, played a solid game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[cj];W[cn];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc]
;B[ef];W[ic];B[fq]LB[nq:A][pj:B]C[Question 1: Here I played the marked stone, but I wonder if this is OK or if there are better moves available.

[kb\]: So far it's a normal game, but I would prefer A or B instead of the move you played.]
;W[dr];B[iq]C[[kb\]: After this combination, Black gives up sente, so the left side framework is not as impressive.  I think you lost something by approaching at F3.]
;W[nc]C[[kb\]: Wrong direction, and wrong area of the board.]
;B[pj]C[[kb\]: Good, but Q14/R14 is probably a little better.  If you respond with a double approach by playing O16, then you can play this move.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[mr];B[lq]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn]C[Question 2: Is the marked stone necessary in your opinion or should I have played tenuki, and if, then where?

[kb\]: Absolutely you should play here, as long as you stick with your plan at the top.]
;W[qf]
(;B[oe]C[[kb\]: Lukewarm - play O16 instead, because you don't mind making the top strong. See variation]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[md]C[[kb\]: This is an overplay.  Just jump to N15.];W[rd]
;B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nd];B[ne];W[me]CR[ng][ni][nk]MA[ic]C[[kb\]: It's not worth anything for Black to fight here, because of the presence of J17 and also because fighting will diminish the Black framework. That is why N16 is not a good move.]
;B[ld];W[mf];B[jd];W[id];B[kf];W[rf];B[pf];W[se];B[qg];W[rg]
;B[qh];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri]C[Question 3: Do you - personally - like Black or White here in this situation (and why)?

[kb\]: Black, but White's crawling is ridiculous.  The N14 stones are very important.  I think White handed you the game here.]
;B[kh]C[Question 4: Is the marked stone Ok or should I have played S10 instead or somewhere else?

[kb\]: S10 is premature.  White should have been playing to rescue the N15 stones and make them stronger.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[ql];B[pl]MA[om]C[[kb\]: You might also consider P7.]
;W[im];B[dm]C[Question 5: Ok, so I leaned on the white group with the marked stone to isolate the white stone and attack it later. Is there a better sequence than what I played the following moves?

[kb\]: This move feels good - the right direction.  However, it's hard to find a good follow-up play that works OK with F3/J3.  Therefore, I'm not sure it's a good move to play here.

You may count points here and then make a decision.];W[dn];B[en]
C[[kb\]: What is your plan if White cuts?  White might be able to leverage your disconnected stones to make a strong central group, which will diminish your chances of winning the game.

Also, I'm not really finding a good continuation for Black after D7.]

(;W[eo];B[fo]C[[kb\]: Not sure about this move.];W[fn];B[em]
;W[go]C[[kb\]: Thank you move.];B[fp];W[fm];B[fl];W[gl];B[fk]
;W[gk];B[km]C[Question 6: An idea if my marked stone is a good move? Also: Which side do you like here?

[kb\]: Black will suffer from poor shape on the left side, which means that it's hard to attack this White group.  This Black move looks purely defensive.  It would have been better to simply play this without all of D7 etc.]
;W[kl]C[[kb\]: An overplay and wasteful White move.];B[jl];W[jm]
;B[jk];W[kn];B[lm];W[ln];B[jn];W[mm];B[ll];W[jo];B[hn]C[[kb\]: Mistake.]
;W[ho];B[mn];W[mo];B[nn];W[in]
(;B[no]C[[kb\]: Is this move necessary?  Perhaps fixing your shape on the left side is better. (see variation, it's long and complicated)]
;W[cm];B[fj];W[cl];B[dk];W[bk]C[[kb\]: Looks small.];B[er];W[cq]
;B[hj];W[gj];B[gi];W[if];B[hl];W[hm];B[hk];W[gm];B[bj];W[ih]
;B[ig];W[jg];B[hg];W[jf];B[kg];W[jh];B[ip];W[io];B[kp];W[hh]

(;B[ko]LB[fi:A][kk:B]C[Question 7: Here my opponent let the time run out and I wonder if there's any way he could still live somehow since there are many cuts available. My rading ability is too poor^^.

[kb\]: See variations - but it does appear that H11 is a nasty problem for Black, so Black can't kill White yet.  A and B are miai for White.

To be honest, I don't think I would have seen H12 as White!

However, it might be the wrong question - before you go for the kill, first count and evaluate whether you think you can win the game by playing safe.  I'll put the count on a variation branch (from above)]
;W[hi]
(;B[kk]C[[kb\]: If Black is afraid of aji on this side, we should play this.  However, I don't think it's possible.]
;W[fi];B[gh];W[ei]C[Again, miai for White to connect.]
(;B[fg]C[[kb\]: Black doesn't have time to play here.];W[dl]
;B[el];W[dj];B[ck];W[ek])
(;B[dj]C[[kb\]: This looks like the best defense.];W[fg];B[gg]
;W[ff]C[[kb\]: Black looks captured here too.]))
(;B[fi]C[[kb\]: Research on the other branch shows Black must defend here.]
;W[kk]
(;B[kj];W[lk];B[ml];W[mk];B[nl];W[jj]C[[kb\]: This doesn't work either.]
)

[ad][el][fr][gq][hq][jq][kr][ks][mp][kq][fs][pm][pe][ke]C[[kb\]: Suppose Black defends here, which neutralizes the White threat.  Does Black have enough?

Black 72 (21 left, 43 center, 8 bottom)
White 71.5 (13 top left, 20 top right/right, 20 bottom left, 11 bottom right, 6.5 komi, 1 capture)

The game is very close.  Killing is a risky move.  If you fail, you lose the game.  If you succeed, you win the game!  But, you have another path to win, depending on the endgame situation.  It's hard to say here.]

I would have refused to play something like O5 simply because of kiai.]

(;B[go]C[[kb\]: Obviously very territorially damaging to answer this way.]
;W[ek];B[di];W[ik]C[[kb\]: White's shape is still very flexible.]
)))
(;B[me]C[[kb\]: What is wrong with this move?  There is no real need to press at the top.  Black should prefer solid shapes when playing omoyo to reduce White's kikashi and yosumi plays.]

;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mb]LB[me:A][nj:B]C[[kb\]: Joseki says play N15, but I might deviate to play P10 here if the resulting well of territory is enough.  N15 feels better, but to each your own, according to your style.  They are miai.]

(;B[me]C[[kb\]: I prefer this line.];W[nj]
(;B[lj]C[[kb\]: Maybe attacking like this is possible, but very, very risky.  A failed attack means Black probably loses the game.]
)
(;B[oh];W[nh];B[og];W[lj]C[[kb\]: Does Black have enough?  It looks playable, but Black must be very patient in dealing with the central White stones.]
))
(;B[nj];W[me]C[[kb\]: Normally, suffering this humiliation is unacceptable, but here it's also 6th line territory.]
;B[nf]LB[mf:A][rd:B]C[[kb\]: What makes this playable is that A is likely not sente.  At the very least, responding with B is good.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[mf];B[ng];W[kk]TR[ie][gd][kf]C[[kb\]: The game is pretty even.  My own style would forbid this kind of play, as it seems meek, but I present it here because I have seen players do it.  I would be unwilling to give up for free all of the implicit White points marked at the top (and all of Black's forcing moves along with it).]
