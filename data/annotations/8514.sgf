AB[pd][dp]C[Hello Jerhum, my name is Michael and I will be reviewing your game today. I will not comment much on opening moves as I am still far from experienced, unless there is something I can confidently contribute. Thank you for letting me review your game!]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[ro];W[pp]C[This move is not optimal for white. Here we have a glaring cutting point that white much come back to fix at Q6. Back simply responds at R3 and white must come back to fix at Q6. This makes it very heavy for white.]
;B[qq]
(;W[pm]C[White should cover back at Q6 to recover as an attack at P6 by black is just too painful for white. In addition, black can still jump underneath at S7, so white so far has not accomplished anything. It has a heavy shape that exerts neither influence nor territory.]
;B[pg]
(;W[qj]C[This does not accomplish much since the territory is already threatened at S7 by black. White should forego trying to secure territory and exert mor influence. R1 is a more natural response so as to follow up with a slide at S13.]
;B[fc];W[df];B[cc];W[dc]C[Good choice. Break up black groups since his influence at the top so far is rather big.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[fb];W[da];B[ca];W[ea]
;B[be];W[bf];B[ab];W[bd];B[bc];W[ae];B[ba]C[This is an excellent position for White. Black has taken the corner, but has only come out with 2 points. White has sente and has a beautiful opportunity to exert his outward influence into either territory or tactical advantage. A follow up at C6 might be natural.]
;W[cn]C[Well done.];B[ci];W[ck]C[Right, this is no problem for white since his upper group is very strong. White now has a very naturall follow up at B4 or E9]
;B[ei];W[ek];B[gi]C[F14 is a critical extension for white]
(;W[gk];B[ff];W[fd];B[hc];W[gd]C[Take note of white's shape. When you have two tiger's mouths at D15 and F16. Note that this is a very severe weakness that you must come back to fix. See the following variation as to why.]

C[The goal of go is not to capture your enemy, but rather to force your enemy to live small. This move shows an intention to kill. While it is possible, it is also too risky for white. White has too many cutting points at L12, K10, and later black can push at H9 to form more cutting points. In addition. Black still can cut after E15. Instead of attacking, white should first patch his mistakes. In order to capture black at this position, he will have to make a severe mistake.]

;B[br]
(;W[eo]C[Maybe not the ideal move. Here is an important principle that if you master, you will improve many stones. Use influence to drive your enemies into it...don't try to use it to make territory. The group at C9 is very influential. E5 is an attempt to convert that influence into territory. Which is wrong. Instead use it to pressure your enemies.]
;B[ep];W[gp]C[Too aggressive. White is too weak - this attack will not do much]
;B[gq];W[fp];B[fq];W[hq]C[Too aggressive. What if black cuts at H4?]
(;B[hr];W[hp];B[ir];W[iq];B[jq];W[io];B[nd];W[qc]C[Good timing. This is huge.]
;B[qd]C[When black has which influence in the upper mid area (where white need to extend into for life, white must play different from the standard joseki]
(;W[pc]C[Interesting choice. Still standard joseki];B[oc]
(;W[rd];B[re]
(;W[rc]C[This is the incorrect move, and is a difference between life and death. It is also a matter of up to 30 points!!! Make sure to review the various paths to life that I have shown :)]

;B[lp];W[oi]C[Good. You have solified a good chunk of territory. But cutting points around K10 are still scary. If black penetrates through, he will win for sure.]

;W[ad];B[cf];W[be];B[lr];W[sb];B[ra]C[White needed two moves for life. This is where most of the points were lost.]
;W[qa];B[sd];W[pa]C[Very good job! I know my comments were very critical, but it's obvious you put a lot of thought into each move. My goal was to mainly point out the "game changing" moves, and I hope I could do that for you. If you could take away 3 concepts from this review, I guarantee that you'll jump 5 stones in strength.

1. Don't attack if it will destabilize your groups too much. Often times you play very aggressive moves that generate cutting points for yourself. It's not productive because you'll generally pay for your mistakes later. Refer to the opening at R6 and your groups at K11.

2. Use influence for influence, not territory. This is a higher level concept. Use your thickness to drive enemy groups into them. That ensures that you can attack with stable groups (not with unstable ones!). Also generating territory with thicker groups is inefficient. refer to your C9 group for that example.

3. Don't follow joseki blindly. Black had very strong influence in his corner. I would recommend trying to think through different ways to live in the corner. It will be worth it since this is what can be attributed to a win or a loss. Refer to Q17 group.

Once again. Good job, and I sincerely thank you for allowing me to review your game. It was a pleasure!]

(;W[pn];B[np]C[This is normal joseki following white's initial mistake. Black has significant influence on the bottm middle edge along with very secure territory on the corner. I don't want you to memorize this pattern, but I do want you to understand the bigger picture here. White's first mistake occured at Q4. He was too aggressive and left himself a glaring cutting point. In order to compensate, he had to go back and fix his mistake but this costed him too much. The overall lesson is, make sure to think about what cutting points you are generating with each aggressive move. Try to think...is this really what you would want?]
