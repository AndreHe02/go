;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq]C[Does it make any difference that White 2 is low? is 3 "normally" at the opposite corner (a or b) instead?  Just curious, doesn't seem to matter.

PC: Playing 3 at D16, followed up with D5, is quite tempting, but I doubt it makes any significant difference.]
;W[dd];B[jd]C[Kind of different for me. Normally I would f17, or c/d4 (a-c)

PC: Or play the Chinese fuseki (Q9 or R9), or make a shimari in the bottom right.]
;W[po];B[pl];W[qf]
(;B[qh]C[Would 1 space closer to my stone be better (a), given how violent this gets? My idea was simply to extend/pincer.

PC: Playing the two space extension would be simpler, but I don't think there's anything wrong with your move.]
;W[rd]LB[pf:a]C[This really puzzled me, I don't know why. What is the best reply?

PC: I think your answer is the best reply. The only other thing that springs to mind is to play 'a' (Q14) to build a wall. This can get complicated, and I'm not entirely convinced by it (see the variation).]

(;B[qc];W[rc];B[oh]LB[rb:a]C[I was thinking defense and potential surrouding. perhaps another reason 9 (marked) might better be at (a)

PC: I'd be inclined to play 'a' (S18) to keep the White group weak. White will find it difficult to attack your stones while his own are still weak.]
;W[of];B[nd];W[pj]
(;B[ok]C[Is this right, or too aggressive? Should I have just attached underneath at 'a'? it just seemed too passive.

PC: This is difficult. One possibility is to play S18 now, reminding the White group at the top that it still doesn't have definite eyes. You might get to strengthen you stones during the ensueing fight. Attaching underneath might be OK - I've added some variations to your variation. Your move might also be OK if followed up correctly.]
;W[ql];B[qm];W[qi]C[I struggled with deciding between the lettered moves. 'd' hane underneath seems wrong. descent to 'c' seems cuttable, 'b' seems to allow the whtie stones to connect, and so I played 'a' on top of his stone, but it seemed odd, both in shape, and touching his weak group so closely.  I also considered 'e', but it seemed to be thinner thatn 'b' with the same effect.

PC: the descent (S12) looks playable (see 2nd variation): if White cuts, it could end up hurting his top group. The hane underneath (S11) does look odd, but maybe is not too bad (3rd variation). The move I like to look of, though, is the "tsuke-atari" at R13 - see the 4th variation.]

(;B[pi];W[oj];B[qj];W[ri];B[rh];W[oi];B[ph];W[qk]C[I'd not anticipated this for some reason. My 3 stones are looking quite lonely.]
;B[rj];W[rk];B[si];W[pm];B[nk];W[qn]
(;B[rm]C[seems silly now. I think I should have cut at 'a' to keep the 3 white stones attackable, even though things basically look a shambles.]
;W[pk]C[Another silly oversight. i wonder why I played 35 now.]
;B[np]C[I'm pretty frustrated, and defend my corner stone.

PC: Seems reasonable. Your stones in the centre aren't cutting stones any more, so there's not much point pullling them out.]
;W[no]C[And so begins White's gigantic moyo, that I fail to reduce.

PC: From another perspective: so begins White giving you lots of territory.]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[lp];W[mi];B[nh];W[pe];B[od]C[I was actually tempted to play 'a', but it seemd like rotten shape,]
;W[qd];B[qb];W[mf];B[rf];W[re];B[rg]C[This right side looks so pitiful now.]
;W[lg];B[mh];W[ke]C[A "thank-you" move - White could have invaded this side.]
;B[kd];W[lj];B[do];W[fp];B[cq]LB[fo:a]C[Is there a different way to play this? This was just automatic for me, but maybe this is a special situation for something else?

PC: If you're worried about the centre, you could attach at 'a' (F5).]
;W[cr];B[cp];W[er];B[ck]C[Also considered 'a', but I thought 'b' would always let me get into the center.]
;W[qp];B[iq]LB[lo:a]C[Seems now not a very good attack, and overly territorial.

PC: The White group is quite strong, so attacking it isn't really on. Yourmove does strengthen your group quite a bit though. Another option would be to turn at 'a' (M5), which would limit White's centre.]
;W[lo];B[qq]LB[kp:a]C[This lets White seal in the side in sente - probably better at 'a' (L4).]
;W[jp];B[jq];W[kp];B[kq];W[dm];B[ek]LB[dl:a][dk:b]C[Dangerous - if White peeps at 'a' (D8) and you connect, you're split into two weak groups. See the variation.]

(;W[en];B[cm];W[dl];B[cl];W[dk]C[I strongly considered getting in with 'a' now, as I saw him take such a monstorous center. I must have had the deer in the headlights look, but I still really thought this territory would keep me on pace.

PC: Black has something like 22 points at the bottom, 12 on the left, 6 on the right and 18 at the top, for a total of 58. White has about 10 on the right, 5 in the bottom left and another 5 in the top right. That leaves him needing another 38 to win. If the entire lower centre turns into territory, that would be enough, provided he matches you on the rest of the board.  You still have the move at H5 to break up the lower centre, so you're still in the game.]
;B[dj];W[ej];B[ei]LB[di:a]C[This helps White strengthen the centre. Just play the extension at 'a' (D11), which leaves the aji of capturing E10 in a ladder.]
;W[fj]
(;B[cf]C[What about 'a'? would pushing some more limit his center? I was concerned his atari-cut would cause me too much trouble.  I'm thinking 83 helps protect these cuts, but now I don't think it does.

PC: See the variation on the previous move. Pushing out looks like it leads to a very close game.]
;W[di];B[cj];W[fi];B[eh];W[ho]C[And now, I have no more good ways in.   PC: True, but you do have a little over 70 points and sente. White has about 80, so you're still in the game.]
;B[fc]C[White's lead is small enough to reduce, if I can play smart, but do I?  Looking back, I think playing the forcing move of 'a' above 57 is worth doing.  This causes me great trouble later.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[fh];B[eg];W[be];B[ce];W[cd];B[bf];W[bc];B[if]
C[So now we have:

Black:
  top: 28
  left: 25
  right: 6
  bottom: 22
  total: 81

White:
  top left: 9
  top right: 5
  bottom left: 5
  right & centre: 60
  total: 79

White has sente, however, so he can defend at J12 and probably be a little ahead.]
;W[lh];B[ih];W[je];B[ie];W[id];B[le]C[I had hoped for a chance to play this so I could cut off the white group, but somehow it isn't enough.]
;W[jg]
(;B[nf]C[Maybe I could connect first with 'a' and get this cut later. i wasn't thinking that way. I felt this cut gave me so many more points that I had caught up, but I was wrong it seems.  I suppose I lose as much on the upper left side.

PC: connecting first looks like it might just be enough to win - see variation on the previous move.]
;W[me];B[ne];W[md];B[mc];W[ld];B[lc];W[ic]
(;B[rb]C[PC: This doesn't seem necessary. Saving the two cutting stones looks like it works, though it gets tricky (see variations on last move). That would put you well ahead. It's difficult (though maybe not impossible) to win after this.]
;W[ig];B[kc];W[dn]C[I should reply to this, but I was worried about the variation.

PC: This looks like the right decision - I don't think you could win after replying to this move (I've added some variations to your variation).]

(;B[ge]C[So, I hold on to this area, but...];W[cn]C[I lose a whole corner. Just didn't see it. I'm sure this was bad. In fact, this may be where I can no longer catch up.

While I see many mistakes, I cannot tell which really hurt me. These mistakes I've mentioned seem obvious to me, and i hated playing them in the game, but they really seemed all I could do, or I'm just being distracted by something I'm preoccupied with in the game. Anyway, I appreciated your inputs.]
;B[bn];W[bo];B[gg]LB[bm:a]C[Connecting at 'a' (B7) is sente and worth about 10 points.]

Getting your sente connection at B7, and the double-sente points in the top left, would have made it very close despite White's huge centre.]
)
(;B[cn];W[ge]C[and I lose this upper area on the left.   PC: I though you could play a nose tesuji and squeeze (see first variation), but it only seems to work if White cooperates.  Rescuring F16 & F17 doesn't seem quite enough to win (second variation).]
