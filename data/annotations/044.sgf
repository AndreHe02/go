(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]VW[]C[Comments by hilt (9k). Heed as appropriate.


The game looked pretty even. As overall comments, it looks like you (TerryT) need to

improve you reading skills, but don't we all :)? I guess the only other advice   I have is that you should give your plans a chance. By this I mean if you go for

a corner (for example) don't change your mind halfway through. Be a bit bolder.

It looked like many of your invasions were not deep enough to be effective, and

some extensions could have been further. On the plus side, it seems like you have

a fairly good idea of what you should be trying to do. You just get lost in the
execution at times.]PB[Chucker]BR[30k]PW[TerryT]WR[20k]DT[1995-01-12]PC

US[Brought to you by IGS];B[dp]C[Traditionally B plays in upper right.]
;W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[fq]L[jq][dj]C[Seems a little slow so early in opening. Especially since corner is still not secure.
Try a or b from the 4-4 point.];AW[cf]L[fc]C[W a may flow more naturally. Especially if black continues similarly.]

(;B[ce]L[dj][fd]C[Bad for B without a stone at a yet. b is simpler. This is where F3 starts to look a bit
slow.];W[df];B[dj]L[cc][fc]C[B leaves corner vulnerable. How to exploit this? White's two stones are not in great
danger yet, so why not approach from b?]
(;W[cc];B[dc]C[Invading the corner is not that bad. But you do have to live.]

(;W[cd];B[be];W[de]C[The two W stones in the corner are too weak to cut now, as the game shows. However, W does

get a nice outside wall in exchange. However, if this was the intent all along, C17  should have been at F17.]
;B[cb];W[bd];B[bc];W[ed];B[bf]C[B is in no danger. This is unnecessary for now. Just gives W the chance to get a nice wall.
If anything, play at E17 and get more profit in sente.];W[ec];B[db];W[eb]
;B[cg];W[dg]M[dj]L[jd]C[Pushing here is futile due to the marked B stone. B can easily get up to the 4th line.
Better to extend now to a and move elsewhere.]
(;B[ch];W[hd]L[jd][ee]C[With a wall this large, you should extend at least to a. However, this does leave the  cutting point b for B later to look for.]
;B[qj];W[qh];B[pl]L[qm]C[B a is the more conventional 2-point extension on the third line.]
;W[qn]C[Good move. Now B is left with a floating group with no eye-space on the edge. See how B R7
looks much better?];B[rl];W[hg]L[pi][oi][nm]C[W seems to have lost the initiative here. B just made a weak group for himself. Now

W should be looking to attack it for profit. Moves that come to mind are a,b,c. There

is no need to kill B, just chase him into the center, while making a nice overhang
for either the top or bottom.]
(;B[fh];W[fg];B[gh];W[gg];B[ei]L[cp]C[B is making a nice moyo. E11 is a bit over-concentrated and almost totally unnecessary.
Instead seal off the corner at a.];W[dm]L[cn]C[This looks like the right idea in the wrong place. Or the worng idea in the  right place :).    If W is to try to live on the side, a may be better. This kind of move on the 4th
line is usually more center-oriented. Play it and run. Watch what happens]
;B[cl]
(;W[cm];B[em]C[W now in trouble.]
(;W[do]L[cp]C[If you try an attatchment, a may be better here. Then you can slip into the corner or  escape.]
;B[co];W[cn];B[bo];W[bn];B[an];W[am]M[cl]L[bm]C[At this point, you just need to try to run for it. There is almost no chance of a single   eye on the edge, much less two. The marked black stone makes the eye at 'a' false.]
;B[ao];W[bl];B[dl];W[ck];B[eo];W[dk];B[el];W[cj];B[dn];W[di];B[ej]
(;W[dh]C[This was a good try. You may have been able to live if you play 'a' first and try for
two eyes.];B[ci];W[bi];B[bg];W[bk];B[bm];W[al]C[This is just a gift for B to capture. These white stones are dead. However, you do

not want to waste moves like this (you were aiming at 'a' to live). This is an  excellent ko threat worth about 20 points. It may come in handy later on.]
;B[aj];W[ek];B[fk];W[eh];B[bj];W[hh]C[This is a fairly big move for white. If he can capture the huge area he has
mapped out on the top, The loss on the side is not as bad anymore. Also, it   puts some indirect pressure on the black group on the right side. White should be
thinking about chasing it pretty soon.];B[gi];W[hi];B[gj];W[hj];B[fb]C[A gift for white? I have no idea of the purpose behind this...]
;W[gk]L[ea][ak]C[However, this is an even larger mistake by black. He should give up the four marked   stones and connect at 'a'. (He still can capture at 'b'). The 8 points in the middle
is overshadowed by getting into white's upper side territory.]
(;B[hk];W[gl];B[fj];W[ea];B[fc]L[ik][oi][pc]C[Another gift for white.
Now is a golden opportunity for white to take the initiative.

He can play 'a' and both save his two stones and put even more pressure on black's

right side. Or 'b' first and chase black into the center, then either 'c' to seal off the
corner, or just 'a' again.];W[fd];B[ik]L[lp]C[Black gets the key point. One more move around 'a' or so and the game is almost over.]
;W[ij];B[im];W[nq]L[pq][lq]C[This move is questionable since the corner is still not quite secure. Either close

it off all the way at 'a' or extend further to 'b'. See variation for corner invasion.]

(;B[iq]L[kq]C[Once again, too timid. 'a' is probably best. White can't invade behind because of
corner weakness.];W[kq];B[kp];W[jq]L[lp][lq]C[Defend your own territory at 'a' here. K3 is risky due to black 'b'.]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[ir];W[lp];B[jp];W[lo];B[jn];W[lm]L[ll]C[One line further to 'a' is better. It puts more pressure on the black right

side group (which is getting weaker and weaker with all the white plays in the area.]
;B[kl];W[md]L[qc][pc]C[Once again, this does little to prevent an invasion. Some may say it even

invites black 'a', completely destroying white's "large" corner. Just seal the   corner off with 'b'. If black invades around N16, he will have a hard time living.]
;B[kn];W[mh]C[Again, just asking for black R17.];B[oh]L[pi]C[The black group is still a bit weak. Try to cut this stone off at 'a'. Either you will get
it, or the other black group dies.]

;W[om];B[ol];B[qk];W[rj];B[rk];W[ri]C[A fairly good result for white anyway.]
;B[qm]L[rn]C[No need for this to make eyes. The group is safe. 'a' would take more territory from  white, and is sente also.]

even if black captures.]
