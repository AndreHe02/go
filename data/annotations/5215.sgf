C[This was a very close game, (at least after my terrible playing in the center) so I thought I'd submit it for review.  This is, at the time, the highest ranked player I've played even with on KGS, a 15k.

I'm particularly curious about my opening.  In my experience, when my opponent makes such a large territory, I've typically done something very wrong, but in this case I was ahead, so my playing may have been somewhat OK.

Comments on my specific questions would be helpful, but it would also be good to know where my blind spots are, i.e. places I didn't even realize I should have played better.

Thanks in advance!

Choi: Please share my idea expecially on steps W224 and B225.]

;B[fq]C[Wanted to deny white a big framework, (I hate big frameworks!) but right after I played it I decided that the pincer wasn't great for me.  It worked out OK, but should I have tried a softer move, say G3?
