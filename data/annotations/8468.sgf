C[Hi reviewer. In this game, I feel my biggest strategic error was playing overconcentrated and making unnecessary defensive moves, but I'm not sure whether that analysis is correct. Let me know what you think.

Hello Norman. Maybe you need to find out WHEN you need to attack, play tenuki or invade. 
In this game, you had good chances but then you let your opponent grow too much and you didn't know how to defend your own moyo in the best way. 
So I won't criticize your playing-style. 
I think its about whole board strategy, value, big moves.... and life and death^^ 
But one can always improve in so many aspects of go... I just hope that my review will be helpfull and you enjoy the game!

(;B[cj]C[Y: This is wrong because now white can run out and thereby cut the two black groups. 
Locally there's only one move: d9]
(;W[gn]C[apparently not joseki

Y: no. according to Kogos Go Dictionary white simply jumps out (E8) instead. if black then tries to connect underneath, white has the peep (see var.)]
(;B[dl]TR[en]C[Norman314 [11k\]: Maybe e8 is better? As this is a contact play it strengthens my opponent's stone, but it my stones are weak too and I want to strengthen them. Or maybe this area of the board is too small now?

Y: Why do you want a stone in this area? The reason is given by the principle 'connect your stones'. 
After d8 white can make life on the inside, but at the same time you will become strong on the outside.
To look for big moves on the whole board is a good habit but if you play r13 white can take the local initiative. and what happens on the left side is not small at all! 
d8 is better than e8, because e8 makes the white stone walk and cut through the black form (i.e. with  d9 through the gap of c10 and e8)]
;W[kq];B[qg];W[mc];B[jc]C[Y: interesting move. It looks vague because it doesn't attack n17 (has still the corner to dive in). but on the other hand it blocks white and prepares territory.
To be honest I doesn't look like a very good move but I have no alternative. Difficult to find the biggest moves in such a situation.]
;W[me];B[je];W[mg];B[jg]C[I made a moyo while white ran with a weak group.

Y: very good! That is.. lame play by white. What is this white wall for? Now black is ahead.]
;W[pb]C[Here, I have trouble telling whether I should respond with the top right group or play elsewhere. It looks like even if I respond locally, white will live, but I don't want my stones to become weak or to give up the corner.

Y: I like your move. it fits well with the large extension! Also when you have r14 instead of r13 you can play so (we'll see the difference between them in a while)
Taking into account that white wants to use the strength of his wall q18 is a very timid move.
And r17 is a reaction that 
- makes territory where white could make territory
- creates good shape
- takes eyespace from whites group
So you need a good reason (a good sente move for example) to skip this gote move.]
;B[qc];W[qb]LB[bp:H][cd:A][df:B][fj:E][gi:F][gl:G][ji:C][jj:D]
[nq:J][qn:I]C[Y: Before I come to your next move, lets have a look on the whole board. You have one group which is under attack right now and one big moyo. Leaving out the corner-situation I tried to figure out big moves. There are those which enlarge your moyo and those which secure territory inside your moyo. Apart from J there are more possibilities to invade or reduce whites area, but they are not so clear to define (depend on tactics)

Focussing on the weak group here is a solid 
Apart from the right upper corner there are many spots  me show you that there are completely different strategies posssible than we would be to sacrifice]
;B[qj]TR[qe]LB[pc:D][qd:E][rb:A][rc:B][rd:C]C[I feel like this might be a bad move. I should maybe approach the corner instead, around R6. But I thought maybe I should strengthen my top right group.

Y: I can understand your caution. If you approach now (r6) white would pincer in order to attack your upper group. Playing r6 (and beeing pincered) would require a different strategy with the readiness to exchange the right upper corner for something..
There is a invasion point that really hurts: r15.
As the variations show also after r10 the group has some problems. The better defensive move would be therefor at A! 

By the way the invasion wouldn't be possible if you had played the small extension (r14) instead of the large one. In that case white would simply play this exchange; white B, black C, white D, black E.
, white could also play the simple exchange: B,C,D,E.]
(;W[qm];B[ej]LB[cc:D][nd:B][nf:C][rb:A]C[The idea was to continue building a moyo on the top left.  Maybe a move like n11 to attack white's weak group would be better here. But I don't know because the white group is not super-weak, and n11 does not really make any territory for me, although it does help to invade white's lower sphere of influence.

Y: N11 would be a bad idea. The white group is stable, N11 is not an attack. E10 is ok. It just looks a little bit overconcentrated - you can jump further.
What else to do to win the game? Defensive moves: A or try to use the peep at B (and you can peep at C too), D
aggressive moves: anywhere in whites sphere of influence. That can be on the third row (bottom) or in the center (mind: even if you don't see how to make territory in the center, white will make there points if you stay away)]
;W[pj];B[pi];W[pk];B[oi]LB[jj:A]C[This move was probably too small. I thought it helped me get better shape locally.

Y: Not perfect but I would play like this too. Its solid and it looms into the center. Another move in that direction would be A.]
;W[mj]LB[jj:A][mk:B]C[Now white has almost built a huge moyo in the bottom.

Y: whites moyo has many gaps and holes. Again I propose A, or try B...]
;B[df]C[Again reinforcing my moyo when I should maybe be invading white's instead.

Y: c16, c17 or d17 would make the more difficult.];W[fc]LB[dc:A]
C[Even after all that reinforcement, this group managed to live. SHould I have been able to kill it? I'm guessing not, because my corner is still open anyway, so white deserves some territory in this region.

Y: But you can close the corner now (A)
how should white manage to live there or escape? Even N17 is far away]
;B[hc]C[Y: This is the wrong idea. You push him into your corner - the only save place for him. F17 serves as a helping stone in the Joseki that is eaten after its use. h17 will be all in vain?]
;W[gc]C[Y: the last chance to kill these stones. Again: just close the corner!]
;B[gd];W[hb];B[ic];W[ib];B[jb]C[To prevent threats to connect.

Y: More points for closing behind him and let him connect on 2. line]
;W[dc];B[cc]C[I wanted to keep white out of the corner. Is f17, with a threat to split, better?

Y: hm, not much of a choice.];W[db];B[ed];W[fd];B[fe];W[ee]
;B[ff];W[de];B[ce];W[ec];B[cd];W[jj]
(;B[hf]C[I wanted to protect against the cuts at g15 and h16, but was this necessary? White lives in sente and even gets an extra move while I defend -- I feel I did something wrong.

Y: yes, because white's about to win the game. The cut alone doesn't work, white must prepare that. Now you should invade too! Or at least find a way into his moyo]
;W[bo]C[Y: You can ignore that kind of move. Its not as big as the invasion /prevention of invasion]
;B[bn];W[fk];B[hk]C[Now I see that white has a big moyo and I need to stop him from completing it. But this end up working, but I think I could have played it better.

Y: Good beginning. white wants to define where the line is, go over it!]

(;B[ro]TR[co]LB[mi:A]C[I figure this move is good since it threatens a monkey jump, but maybe not. If I'm alive here, I should probably invade the other corner.

Or maybe the cut at P4 is good?? See variations.

Y: First p2 (white o3) then o2. After that you can play s5 or s6 Or tenuki. 
But what about A? Its obvious, the connection to the white upper group isn't yet installed. Even if you can't kill it, maybe you can manage to get into the moyo once again with that threat.]
