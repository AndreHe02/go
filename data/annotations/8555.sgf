(;B[cq]C[This move seems a little slow.  Although it denies white the corner, it allows white to jump ahead.  I don't feel confident enough in my judgement to consider this a mistake however.]

(;B[cj]C[There's a saying "Never peep when you can cut."  In this case you cannot cut now, because of the ladder (see variation) but later you might be able to.  This weakness is referred to as "aji".  Although it's not an exploitable weakness now, it may be one in the future.  Peeping with c10 allows white to correct this weakness. This move could be used to strengthen the bottom left group or to play elsewhere.]
