C[
I will be playing as the white stones this game.
The game will be a cross-fuseki, which I do not often play so any advice in the opening will be appreciated.

Pat : I must admit I couldn't answer many of your questions because I am not good enough and I gave you my point of view only if I was sure.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[dp]C[I considered playing a 3-4 point, but I was unsure what the continuation would be.
Pat : I think the differrence between a 3-4 move and a 4-4 move is very thin at our playing level. Why not first practicing only one of them?]

(;W[pp]LB[pp:A][qp:B];B[nq]C[After look at the result in the game, I think backing off at 'b' is perhaps better.]

(;W[lq]LB[qn:B][lq:A];B[pq]C[I didn't know the joseki response to this move during the game. 'b' is joseki.]

(;W[oo]LB[oo:A][qq:B];B[qq];W[qp];B[rq];W[ql]TR[oo][lq]C[I didn't expect the attachment at 'a'.

I thought he would cut the marked stones but I think I could make life on the bottom.]
;B[pl]C['b' seems too passive and I didn't think he could crosscut.]

;B[nm];W[iq];B[pi]C[I thought at this point I needed to make life here, but maybe making the extension and connecting were miai.]
;W[nc]C[I chose to approach this corner because the bottom seems small in comparison.]
;B[nd]C[Eidogo, says this joseki should only be played by black here if he has a big moyo on the right. In this case, I don't know that his moyo is big enough.

I didn't know the joseki, but managed to play the correct move.]
;W[md];B[ne]C[Going into the corner is joseki. The extension is not. Option 'e' is suggested when black has the extension on the right.]

(;W[jd]LB[ob:D][oc:B][pc:C][qc:E][jd:A];B[oc];W[mc];B[lf]C[I don't know if the timing of this invasion is correct. I suppose approaching the bottom corner is another option, or taking my enclosure.]
