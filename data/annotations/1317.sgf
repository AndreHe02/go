C[dear reviewer,

i am white and although i win by .5, i am not proud of this game where my opponent made a big mistake againt an overplay by me.

You are right that you should have lost this game. It is a good sign that you recognize this.

I have made many specific comments on the game and added some variations, but the main thing I notice about your game is this.

You are too territory conscious in the beginning. Look at the number of 2nd line moves you made in your first 50. If you pay attention to this tendency, and question it as you play, I think you can improve.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[cc]C[White C17 seems a little inconsistent with D4. C17 is a territory oriented move while D4 is influence oriented.]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[kq];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[dd]TR[jd][nc]C[Playing D17 instead of C16 seems more consistent with the triangled stones. (K16 and O17)]

(;W[cd];B[de];W[eb];B[gd]C[Now black has pushed white down at the top in sente.

The original intent of K16 was top side territorial prospects. This plan has been thwarted.]
;W[ic]C[Black C15 is too slow since it does not threaten the corner.

Black can play a shimari in the lower right since his upper left stones are in fine shape.]

(;B[ce]C[I think one line back is more prudent since black is thick.]

(;W[cj];B[ch];W[ej];B[pj]C[Question: now is it better for me (more urgent) to attack black's group around d15 or to play as i did?

Neither is good. You must do something about black's lower right framework now.

Black's group in the upper left is hard to attack right now. You cannot expect to kill black and there is no place to profit from an attack.

G18 is purely territorial and small  being on the 2nd line. You cannot afford to play this move and let black play P4.]

(;W[gb]C[If black completes his structure now, white has trouble competing on territory.

It is unreasonable to expect to kill black in the upper left.

Black plays a 50% move with F12 and lets white back in the game.]

(;B[fh]
(;W[dr]MA[op]C[ok?

I like P4 better, but your move has two good qualities. It takes the lower left corner and it has a good follow-up at J3.]
;B[er]C[C3 leaves good corner aji plus sente if black stabilizes his shape at the lower left.]

(;W[eq];B[fr];W[fp];B[gp]C[should i answer?

I can understand your desire to take sente, but giving black the atari at F5 is huge. The problem is caused by your previous move.]

(;W[op]C[Black Q4 is a little crude. The sequence starting with Q3 seems about par.]

(;B[pp];W[oq];B[pr]C[how to fight against this?

You are happy with this development. Your move is fine. Now you are moving out into the center ahead of black.]
;W[on];B[fo]C[You should answer this because you have to answer when black takes.]
;W[qn];B[or]C[Since black was submissive with P2, you need to make shape with Q5 or N7.]

(;W[ep]C[Black lets you off the hook.]
(;B[nq];W[np];B[mq];W[go];B[hp]C[go as far as s10?

You cannot get away with S10.

Your move just helps black build the upper right. I think I would be prepared to sacrifice something on the right to play G6. Unless black kills everything on the right you will be ok. Black has a hard time coming up with a killing attack on your 4 right side stones.]

(;W[rk]
(;B[qj];W[rj];B[ri];W[pl];B[fn];W[pb];B[qc];W[ne];B[dk]C[how to react?

White has a difficult problem here. Black's move is valid and severe. The danger is not losing the left side white territory. Black is threatening to swell the bottom center moyo enough to win. I think that you have to connect against the peep and move your three stones into the center. Eventually you will get some pressure on the somewhat weak black group in the top left.]

(;W[ck];B[dm];W[em];B[el];W[cm];B[dl];W[cl]C[Black is shorting his own liberties here. He needs to exploit the corner aji.]

(;B[dj];W[di];B[fm];W[en];B[fl]MA[mn]C[What is white thinking? If black gets a move at N6 the center becomes huge.]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[bg]C[Black gives up sente unnecessarily.]

Black is ahead and has no weak groups. It is hard to see what white can do to win.   Of course, black's play in the next fight lets you back in the  game.
