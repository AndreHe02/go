AB[pd][dp];W[pp];B[cd];W[ec]C[this thwarted my intention of a chinese high opening.]
;B[ee]C[strange? Why e15? It's a little aggresive but whitout construction, neither moyo neither territory. Many joseky are good :-) d15 or d14 or pincer at g17]
;W[fd]C[strange too. If white wants to stabilize the position he must play H17]

(;B[jc]C[k17 good point if the west is ok. I think that a better move would be D10. (see var)]
;W[cb]C[slow but ok];B[fe]C[why? I don't see how f15 is a useful move.
If you want to destabilize the white group, play h18.
If you want to make a moyo, play d10];W[gd]C[bad too. H17 is better because you can fight the k17 stone]
;B[ge]C[another stone for what? D10];W[id]C[it's a good idea, but the k17 stone is here and it's difficult for white to play both under for territory and for the center]
;B[jd]C[if black wants territory, he must play on m17
but pressure on white group is good];W[ie]C[ok, now white is good in the center]
;B[cj]C[at d10 : perfect];W[nc]C[hard attack];B[lc]C[yes];W[ne]
C[yes];B[pf]C[ok]
(;W[ib]C[oops? out of range.
the problem is the 2 stones O17 O15];B[le];W[ng];B[lg];W[ni]
;B[jp]C[and the 2 group on q16 m17?];W[jf]C[if we want attack this group, be careful because we have a trick on O17.]
;B[je];W[kf];B[lf];W[ig];B[hf];W[ji]C[not an urgent move. connect j14 is not so bad]
;B[if]C[ok];W[jg];B[ic]C[wow! good];W[hc]C[tsstss];B[hd]C[yes, very good. connection is now ok, so let go to fight]
;W[gc];B[li]C[good point];W[cn]C[white doesn't see the black attack?]
;B[en]C[ged : I didn't want to push at C5, in case I encouraged a connection with the white centre group, which I was looking to pressurise.

yes but... is the c8 pincer not good?];W[bp];B[cq];W[bq];B[bl]
C[you want close the center or close the border?
e6 is a bad move with b8 because now white can play for the center.]
;W[dm]C[yes, if black don't close the center, run away.];B[dl]
C[?];W[dh]C[ged : Not sure how to deal with this move, so I forced first, to solidify the top.

I don't understand this move. The white group at k13 is not ok and d12 forces a severe black response.]
;B[dc]C[?];W[db]
(;B[ed]C[bad move because gote. attack the only stone under your moyo and attack the k13 group too.
G12];W[fh]C[ged : E16 was not a good enough forcing move!

fine :-)];B[hh]C[too late];W[ej];B[ei]C[too close];W[fi];B[di]

yes, very big :-)];B[nq]C[hey, you can play for your stones on q16 q14.
R17 for example.];W[qc]C[:-)];B[pc]C[too late];W[qb];B[pb];W[re]
;B[nb]
(;W[mc]C[bad, see variation];B[mb];W[hp]C[why figth at south? white have good point at Q6]

tss tss play Q1 first];B[qs]C[ged : I didn't fancy the ko, so lived instead.

yes!];W[ol];B[br];W[dr]C[ged : this white move (d2) was my downfall; how could I have handled it better?

because H4, D2 is a possible move.];B[cr];W[gq];B[ir]C[J3 strong]
