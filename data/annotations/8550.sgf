C[Hi David,

my name is Felix and I'm reviewing your game.
I focused on opening and middle game, because I think these are the most important stages of the game.
I noticed several times, that you are somewhat inconsistent with your moves. That means, if you have a certain idea you should stick to it. For example if you threaten to cut, cut if your opponent does not respond.]

(;B[ed]LB[dc:A]C[I personally prefer the continuation after A, because I find it somewhat easier. But your choice is also ok.]
;W[db];B[hd];W[fd];B[ec];W[eb];B[gb];W[cc]
(;B[fb]C[This move is ok. It is considerd joseki and has appeared in several pro games.]
;W[fe]LB[bd:B][ce:A]C[White's move is dubious. It deviates from joseki. Usually White plays 'A' or 'B' to take some territory in the corner.
Usually your opponent's move is your move. See variations.]
(;B[df];W[dd]C[Because this wedge exists, your last move is not good.]
;B[ee];W[ce];B[cf];W[ib]
(;B[hc]C[This move is probably the best.
See variation.];W[lc];B[ff]LB[nc:B][hf:A]C[This hane is a bit slow. It does not capture the White stones entirely and the group on the left is already strong. So I prefer 'A', attacking both white groups at the same time and strenghtening yourself or 'B', defending the corner and attacking the white group on the top.]
;W[ge]
(;B[he]LB[hg:A]C[This is pushing from behind. Bad style.
'A' should capture the white stones and expands the left.];W[nc]
;B[gf]C[Very slow. See next move.];W[qk]LB[nc:2][he:1][gf:3]
[hg:A][qk:4]C[Please take your time to look at this position for a moment.
1 through 4 are the exchanges that have been made during the last moves.
White got to play on the right side first!
If you imagine playing 1 at 'A' to capture the white stones with one move, you would have been first to play on the right!
This difference is huge.];B[nq];W[qg];B[oe]C[Good choice.];W[jq]
(;B[nn]LB[qn:A]C[I think the double approach at 'A' is better.]
;W[nk];B[qq]LB[nk:2][nn:1]C[If you go in the corner now, the exchange 1 for 2 is not neccessary.]
;W[np];B[pq];W[mq]
(;B[qo]LB[qp:B][oq:A]C[Letting White play 'A' is not good. Especially because White can cut through at B later.]
;W[oq];B[qn];W[qp]LB[rm:A]C[Actually, because of the cut, White could simply play A in sente.]
;B[rp];W[rq];B[rr];W[ro];B[sq];W[rm];B[rn];W[dn];B[dm];W[cm]
(;B[cl]C[Usually after a crosscut you should extend.];W[em]
;B[dl];W[qe];B[qc]LB[qd:A][og:B]C[I think this move should be at 'A', possibly also 'B'.]
;W[co];B[bm];W[lf];B[me]LB[og:A]C[This is like banging your head against a wall. Simply 'A' would be better in my opinion.]
;W[le];B[ng];W[mg];B[nh];W[nf];B[of];W[mh];B[ni];W[mj];B[gk]
LB[qi:A]C[It is not the right time to play there.
You miss a golden opportunity here.
'A' not also helps your group to settle, it also attacks the two white stones.]
;W[qi]C[:-(];B[be]LB[bd:A]C[Better to descend at 'A'.];W[bd]
;B[hq];W[bf];B[bg];W[fn];B[cq]LB[fn:2][hn:A][cq:3][hq:1]C[Here you are inconsistent again.
First you play 1. White locally responds with 2, after which you go in the corner with 3.
Either you should go in the corner directly or follow up your invasion of 1 with a move like 'A'.]
;W[dq];B[bo];W[ob];B[pb];W[hn]LB[hq:A]C[Now your move 'A' is swallowed.]
;B[rd];W[pa];B[qa];W[on];B[oo];W[ne];B[nd];W[mf];B[pg];W[ih]
;B[om];W[mn];B[fl]LB[ik:A]C[I do not understand this move. You are so strong in this area.
Even if there is a cut, you should defend it with a move like 'A'.]
;W[el];B[ek];W[ae];B[nr]C[Good!];W[or];B[mr]LB[op:A]C[This seems a bit risky if White connects at 'A'.]
;W[lq];B[op]C[Now it is a big loss locally for White.];W[no]
;B[pn];W[cg];B[ch];W[ag];B[bh];W[ph];B[oc];W[pf];B[og];W[ij]
;B[il]LB[mm:A][lo:B]C[I think the hane at 'A' is big. Even a play at 'B' could be feasible because White's shape is very bad.]
;W[md];B[od];W[hl];B[hk];W[cp]
(;B[bq];W[lr];B[mo]C[This move is wasted.];W[mp];B[pr];W[bp]
;B[ap];W[bn];B[an];W[cr];B[mm];W[ln];B[lm];W[ms];B[os];W[re]
;B[kn]C[Big.];W[lo];B[in]C[You always have to ask yourself, if your sequence ends in sente or gote. If it ends in gote, you should think about it again.]
;W[io];B[jn]C[Ending in gote.];W[nb]C[This should have been your move.]
;B[rb]C[And if you have to respond like this, it is even worse.
