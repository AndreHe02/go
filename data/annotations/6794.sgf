AB[dp][pd][pp]C[Hello, reviewer. I played Black in this game and got torn to shreds ^_^

This game is an example of how all of my games have been going recently. I play my best, but somehow, somewhere, the game turns on its head and I'm stymied as to how it happened and how I could have avoided it.

Any and all help would be appreciated. Preferrably, I'd like to know why I lost the fights (and if I ever had a chance), and get some advice how I could do better next time.

Thanks.

N: hello, my comments will be preceded by "N:" This is the first time i review a handicap game but i did not feel it was necessary to include special handicap comments, but it is obvious that you start the game with an advantage and the fact that you seem ahead at some point does not mean you couldn't have made better moves. I think especially in the fuseki you should have played better. You made a very common mistake in the lower right, eliminating this should already help you improve by quite a bit. Also you seemed confused by the upper right, wich is a common situation.Try to understant this better. 
The fight was not necessary because i think you could have killed the invader relatively easily.
During the fight you could have played at some points better shapes, maybe this could be the key to improve your fighting.

Kind regards,
Nelis (Lambic)];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[ic];W[dj]LB[cn:A]C[N: strange move, it does not feel like the best to me. I suppose it aims at A, but why not play there right away?
 I would like to 'punish' it right away]
(;B[jp];W[qf];B[nd];W[qn]
(;B[ql]LB[pj:B][pk:A]C[I'm not comfortable with this move here. I wanted to prevent a B O4, W Q10 exchange because my invading is pathetic, but the outcome with the double kakari was unbearable. However, I do not see a response to White R6 that seems any better. How could I have turned this corner to my advantage?

N: you should not fear the white constuction with q10, it is very fragile. See var.
If you are not so agressive, but you want to play a pincer, a high pincer is more relaxed, A or B are nice possibilities
I'd prefer A];W[nq]

(;B[qp]C[N: this is a bad shape, a common mistake];W[pq];B[oq]
;W[or];B[op];W[rp]
(;B[ro]C[N: bad, it seems you don't think flexiblel: each move you should be willing to consider changing your previous plan, this is a way to improve.
Here you are too attached to the right side (wich in fact only gets very small)]
;W[rq];B[qo];W[mq]C[N: white has a lot of territory and black a bad, cramped shape]

(;B[mo]C[N: you should attack]
(;W[kp];B[ko];W[lo];B[ln];W[lp];B[jo]C[After everything, Black has some influence but cramped shape, while White has at least thirteen points and sente. I'd like to say that I came out better here, but I can't really believe it, especially since White went straight to reducing my influence and settling R14.

N: see previous comments, you are still ahead, but could have done better.]
;W[qi];B[qe];W[pf]C[I am conflicted about the R15, Q14 exchange. It has its merits: White has a cramped shape, and Black can defend the corner with S14 (which I did immediately). However, it means I can't really attack White's group anymore, which all but nullifies my thickness on the right side. However, I do not see a better move. What to do here?

N: the exchange is good: cramped shape, in a way you drive blackto your thickness. You might not be happy because you would want r8 at r9, but is the best you can do now. The white group still is not safe, so it can still be attacked.]

(;B[rf]C[This seems to be the only real follow-up. Anything else leaves the san-san open and allows White to live comfortably. However, I'm not sure I should have entered into this sequence in the first place...

N: to me it is ok
however your thinkink about san-san seems to have a mistake see previous var]
;W[rg]
(;B[nf]C[This move FEELS right, but I'm not sure how useful it really is. In the end, this stone did not end up doing much. Should I have played elsewhere?

N: if you where attacking (of wich you where not aware?) and defending your corner, you should continue to do so.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[sf]
(;B[sd];W[oe];B[od]C[Reading is not my strong suit. I connected at P16 out of fear of B O15, W P16, P17, Q17. I was afraid I'd lose the corner, but it turns out I'd probably have been okay. Should I have played O15 instead?

N: this move is logic, it destroys aji.]
(;W[cn]
(;B[en]SQ[qp]C[I played here because I was at an utter loss what to do down here. I cannot play for territory, because my bottom is open and the corner stone is a hoshi, and anything I try to do to take what little I can get on the bottom will allow White to counter my influence in the center. However, this gives White the territory he needs to catch up. What should I have done here?

N: i find it difficult too, to suggest a good move, this is the result of your play at the marked stone, wich created a bad shape and as a consequence less possibilities for good moves. Your move should be playable, i would be tempted to play tenuki because white does not have such a good follow up i think.]
;W[bp]
(;B[jr]C[N: the corner is big for both and you have a follow-up]
;W[kr];B[jq];W[cq];B[dq];W[lc]C[White strikes at an opening in my shape. What I know of Go tells me that this play is unreasonable and that I should have at least profited from this invasion where I was stronger, and possibly should have killed this. However, I got nothing out of the fighting that ensued... what did I do wrong?

N: here you should have read a bit, recognised the most agressive move and seen that white has (too) little space to live. Confidence in lifa and death problems can help you a lot of course.]

(;B[fh]LB[ch:A][di:B]C[I didn't want him to take J11, but if I took it myself, he'd take F12 himself and the attack would be over with nothing left to show for it. At least, that's how I see this position. Was this a mistake?

N: it seems that this move is best, f11 is a key point for shape, but this is a keypoint for attack and defence, it gives breethingspace for the black group, attacks white and creates future options like A or B to split white.]
;W[ii]
(;B[ji];W[jj];B[ij]C[I thought that I could create two weak groups by cutting here, but both lived and destroyed my influence. Should I have withdrawn instead at L11? Or would the cut at H11 been more profitable?

;B[ni];W[oj];B[pj];W[pi];B[pk]C[Okay, I still think I sould have had the upper hand in this position. White is horribly surrounded, but I cannot help but think that this should have been R9 instead.

N: this move is logic.];W[ok]
(;B[nl]C[Would P8 have been better? I have read out that White has chances to escape thanks to the weakness of the J10 and H9 stones, but I can probably still kill and I cannot allow White to capture the right like he did.

N: P8 looks a lot better.];W[ol]
(;B[nm]C[Was this response really forced? In the game, I didn't see the danger to my three stones (though I suppose it is really obvious, but even now, I cannot see how Black can allow O7.

N: looks like this was your last chance.];W[qm]
(;B[fj]C[I wanted to kill White's dragon now that one of my victims had survived, but looking at this now, Black looks awfully thin to pull the kill off. Is there any way I could have strengthened my position by threatening the left side and then successfully killed White's top?

N: i feel white is slightly ahead here. I can't see a clear shot here. To me you missed your 'easy' chances earlier.]

I (mis)read that Black could stay connected by playing here. Would E13 have worked, or is it time to try to salvage what I can by abandoning the attack?

N: blocking at the ouside feels normal to me. However here it does not seem to work either.
