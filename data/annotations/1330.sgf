;B[dj];W[kd];B[jk];W[cd];B[gc]LB[ji:A]C[This invasion is not-so-good, as there is not
room for a good extension when W blocks.
There are still other good moves available
like making an enclosure at A, so this invasion
seems a bit premature.];W[ic];B[dc]
(;W[dg]LB[cc:A]C[This move is not natural. Playing at A is much
better, because it concerns the eye-space of
both the black and the white group. It is also
big in terms of territory in the corner. In  addition, it is sente - the natural continuation
is given in the variation...];B[ch];W[dh]
(;B[cg]LB[ci:A]C[This move looses sente for black. Better play  the defensive move at A immediately as in the  variation.]
;W[cf];B[ci];W[ji]
(;B[ki]LB[hk:A][cc:B]C[Since it is of vital importance who gets to play
first in the upper left corner, black should have
a play that revolves around keeping the  initiative. In this particular position, playing at A  or B seems possible...]
;W[kh];B[kj];W[jg];B[hj]LB[ik:A]C[This move is bad. Locally it should be on space  to the right or one space lower to remove the  possibility of white playing A. In the current  situation, playing in the upper left corner is  more important anyway.]
;W[cc]C[This was long overdue...];B[cb];W[bb];B[eb];W[dd]LB[ca:A]
[ba:B]C[White should first destroy black's eye-shape by  playing A. This is very urgent, as a black play at  B is sente.]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[fd];W[fj]TR[hj]C[Now black wishes the marked stone was one  space lower.]
;B[fk]LB[dl:A]C[Since this move doesn't work (black cannot link  up) it is better not to play it. Playing it only  makes white stronger. A better alternative is  playing at A, threatening to link up.]

the points C and D are also very big and should  be played as soon as possible.]
;B[hh]C[Black also fails to take one of the important  points.]
;W[hg];B[ih];W[ig];B[jh]C[This move is very bad, black removes his own  liberties, so white can capture the black stones  later. It is a trick move, hoping white will  capture prematurely.]
;W[lh]C[But white sees through the trick play... In  effect, black forced white to take one of the  important points, while removing his own  liberties so that white can later capture his  stones.]

(;W[gg]LB[fi:A]C[This move is not good. White should play at A,  because it threatens to capture black's stones  and because it protects his centre territory  better.]
