C[This game contains a lot of missed opportunities for W and a few for B.  B won because he took advantage of W's lost opportunities but W did not do the same.  There were two critical plays by W which swung the game heavily against him.  See the comments attached to the final play of the game.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[fc];W[id]LB[cf:a][cg:b]TR[dj][cj]
C[A play on the left at 'a' or 'b' is probably the 'safe' move.  This pincer (or any pincer for that matter) is not  usually played unless there is a supporting stone on the left around one of the triangle points.  See the comments on the next move for the reason why this supporting stone is needed.  In view of those comments it can be seen than W should probably not play this pincer until there is an extension to the left.]

(;B[cf]LB[cc:a][fe:b]C[This move is not bad but B has a lot of options here.  See, for example, the variations starting at 'a' and 'b'.]

(;W[ee];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[eg]LB[dh:a][eh:b]C[Not really bad for W, but if B plays 'a' next (as he should) it is a bit of a difficult situation for W.  He really has to push at 'b' but, in conjunction with B3, this gives B excellent prospect on the left and W6 ends up too close the wall which W makes.]
;B[db]TR[ld][md][mc][lc]LB[dh:a]C[Far too early.  This move is aji keshi.  It effectively kills off B5.  Without this exchange there is a lot of potential in B5.  For example, if future moves give B any strength around the triangled stones then B could threaten to pull 5 out and maybe attack either W6 or the group to the left.  Another consideration is that if B plays the correct move of 'a' then his group is save and the hane and connection is small for both sides.]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]LB[ic:a]C[W is very grateful for this exchange.  There is very little aji left in B5 now.  About the best that B can aim for is to attach at 'a', but if this is done too early W will just seal him in and take profit on the outside.]
;B[ck]LB[dh:a][ch:b][be:c]C[A bad move for two reasons.  It is too low in relation to B7 and is it is sort of in no man's land between B3 and B7 and is invadable on both sides. As mentioned previously, it should be at 'a'.  'a 'protects against W at 'b'  which threatens 'c', a fact which is significant much later in the game.   These moves cannot be played yet, but the threat of them should worry B.]
;W[nc]C[Good move, taking advantage of the top.]
(;B[nd]LB[qg:a]C[Questionable.  B does not have a lot of potential in B5 but he should aim at keeping the position at the top fluid in case the opportunity occurs to revive B5.  Playing at 'a' is probably best (see variation)]
;W[md];B[ne];W[qc]LB[oc:a]C[Trying too hard.  If B responds at 'a' W loses out (see variation for next move).  W at 'a' is adequate and protects the territory at the top.]

(;B[qd]LB[oc:a]C[B misses an excellent opportunity here.  It should be at 'a'. See the variation.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[nb]LB[mb:a]C[Better at 'a'];B[me]
;W[ld];B[pk]LB[qn:a][qo:b][pn:c][qm:d]C[One point too far.  The reason is that it makes an approach move at 'a' undesirable.  Such a move would be answered by the 'b', 'c' exchange and then B31 is to close to the 2-stone wall which is produced.  Either hold back one point and aim at 'a' (W probably would preempt that with a move at 'd') or go all the way to 'a' right away.  If B plays 'a' it is very hard for W to pincer because of B's strength at the top.]
;W[ph]LB[qm:a]C[Too early and too deep.  At this point he invasion should not be deeper than the sector line formed by B31 and B29. This provides a target for B.  Because B31 is high 'a' can be played in in sente  and so it is unlikely that B will get a big territory out of this, especially not one worth all the stones invested.  I would suggest  playing 'a' now to see how B responds.  If he ignores it then he cannot expect much territory on the right.
This is probably the loosing move.];B[oi]C[Nice move.  B should not expect or try to kill W.  Sealing W in with a small live in gote and giving B a lot of outside thickness will give B a very nice position.]
;W[qj]C[W doesn't really have any choice but it is hard to see B seal him in.]
;B[qk];W[rj]LB[ri:a]C[Heavy. 'a' is the shape move.];B[qg]LB[ri:a]
[rk:b]C[Very nice point. It is questionable whether W can live now. He probably will, but at quite a cost.  Note that if W36 is at 'a' then he can make nice shape with 'b']
;W[pg];B[rg]C[Another excellent point.];W[ng]LB[pj:a]C[This is an interesting position.  W is in trouble but B cannot press too hard because of W survives the B stones at the top may actually come under threat.  W also has the threat of pushing an cutting at 'a'.  It is possible that B could kill W, but very unlikley and so B should not even try.  Just be happy with the thickness optained by sealing W in.]
;B[mh]LB[le:a]C[Pushing once at 'a' first gives more power to this move.  It is almost impossible for W to ignore 'a'.]
;W[mg];B[lg];W[lh];B[lf]LB[le:a]C[With 'a' in place this move is not necessary.]
;W[nh];B[mi];W[ni];B[nj];W[mj]LB[oj:a][nk:b]C[Prabably better to play directly at 'a'.  If B connects at 50 there is just a little bit more live in W44 than in the game and W will also have a cutting point at 'b' to aim at after he is sealed in.]
;B[li];W[oj];B[nk];W[pj];B[ok]LB[rl:a]C[An excellent sequence for B. W cannot make 2 eyes and so must either pull out 44 and fight (not a good prospect) or must run out at 'a']
;W[rl];B[rk];W[sk];B[qm];W[qh]
(;B[kh]LB[ri:a]C[The combination of 58 and 60 has given W life (see variation) but B can still take advantage of the situation by playing the variation starting at 'a']
;W[lk]C[What can W hope to achieve by this except to create another group to attack?  There is no prospect of attacking the stones to the right.  A move  along the bottom is necessary, although it is hard to know exactly where to play given B's tremendous thickness.  This is equivalent to a pass at a critical point in the game.]
;B[np]LB[mp:a]C[Excellent point although a case could be made for holding back to 'a' to prevent the pincer which actually occurred.  However, if B deals with the pincer correctly he has nothing to worry about.]
;W[lp]LB[lq:a]C[An unusual pincer but W is desperate and there really is not a lot of choice. 'a' is an alternative.]

(;B[pq]LB[nn:a]C[This is a defensive move when B is on the offensive.  Don't bury your head like an ostrich when you should be soaring like an eagle. See the variation at 'a']

(;W[oq]LB[qq:a]C[This leads to unnecessary trouble.  Keep it simple and follow the variation at 'a']
;B[op];W[qq];B[pr];W[qr];B[or];W[qo];B[po]C[B has got away with his move at 65.]
;W[rn]LB[qp:a][pn:b]C[Unnecessary.  Connecting is better as it ensures life. This W74 is connecting to stones which can be captured.  By connecting at 'a' W reserves the chance of playing at 'b' later as B is hardly likely to take gote to protect it at this stage.  And, with 'b' on the board for W there is just an outside change of doing something by threatening the B stones above.]
;B[qp];W[rp]C[W has been totally outplayed in this sequence.]
;B[qn];W[pp];B[jp]C[It is hard to see how W can possibly win this game now.  W has at most 40 points with no chance of any more except for maybe a minor invasion.  B has very little secure territory but with all the thickness and influence it is hard to see how he can fail to get a lot more than 40 points.]
;W[hp]LB[ip:a][ho:b][eq:c]MA[fc]C[W needs something deeper than this.  If Ba, Wb Bc then B probably has enough territoy to win and W still has a lot of weak stones.  At this stage it is not unreasonable for B to start thinking of saving the marked stone because W will not have the time to both stop B from saving the stone and stop him from making huge thickness while threatening to save it.]
;B[ko]C[Timid.  W has no way to threaten to save 64 at this stage.  W should be attacking W80.]
;W[iq]LB[jr:a][cp:b][ch:c]C[W cannot afford this luxury.  B's response seals off too much territory.  W must create complications, hope that W80 lives and that it can be used to slide to 'a'.  It is time for W to invade the corner at 'b' and hope for the best. W must not forget that if he can get a foothold on the left side then 'c' may end up being sente against the top left.]
;B[jq];W[hn];B[jl];W[jm]LB[cp:a]C[It is hard to see what W achieves by this.  Keep the position in the center as fluid as possible and invade the corner at 'a' hoping that these stone can take care of themselves later.]
;B[km];W[jj]C[I don't understand this move at all.  If it is a threat to pull out 50 and 62, so what?  B can let white take the 2 or 3 moves needed to save than and make another heavy group.  Certainly pulling them out does not threaten any B stones.]
;B[kk]LB[il:a]C[Better at 'a' to keep W separated.];W[ki]C[Another strange move.  It may be sente but it doesn't achieve anything as W has to answer any response B makes and may still end up with gote.]
;B[kj];W[eq]C[Not big enough. W needs the corner to win.];B[dq]
;W[ep];B[cn]LB[do:a]C[Cowardice in the extreme. What is wrong with 'a'?]
;W[ci]LB[ch:a][be:b]C[Wrong point. 'a' is the point as it threatens 'b']
;B[ff]TR[en][dh][je]C[B is trying too hard.  Why complicate a won game?  Any of the triangle points look better than this.]
;W[fe]C[W must connect and hope for the best.];B[dg]LB[en:a]
C[Nice combination, although at this stage it isn't necessary to get too clever -- it may lead to unnecessary  complications and a mistake.  Just applying gentle pressure to W's bottom stones (with something like 'a') is sufficient.  The W stones will not die, but while they are living B's territories will become solidified and B's margin will only increase.]
;W[df];B[cg];W[eh];B[di];W[dh];B[he]LB[ch:a]C[What is this trying to do? Blocking at 'a' gives a guaranteed win  by at least 10 points, probably closer to 20.]
;W[ie];B[hg];W[hf]LB[ch:a][jg:b]C[B has given W a (small) chance to catch up, but to do so W must both get to play at 'a' and capture ALL the B stones 97,105,107. It is a tall order but there is no other way.  Just about the only chance is to play 'b']
;B[gf];W[if];B[gh];W[ge]C[Too small. W is not going to win playing this way.]
;B[ef];W[dj]C[W cannot give up 100.  If black saves his center stones there is no chance.  On the other hand, if these stones die then the game is over.  This shows that W's strategy here is seriously flawed.]
;B[fb]LB[de:a][hd:b][gj:c]C[Pointless. Just play at 'a' (threatening the combination of this move and 'b') and then jump out at 'c'.]
;W[ea];B[hd]C[Doesn't work until W100 is captured. Making the capture immediately in sente is much better.]
;W[hc];B[de];W[gd];B[dk]LB[gj:a][en:b]C[A little too direct.  W has a good counter.  A play at 'a' will force W to run and then B an play 'b' as a splitting attack.  Neither W group is likley to die but B will get nice profit by the attack.]
;W[ek];B[ej]LB[en:a]C[Too aggressive.  Apply indirect pressure to this group by attacking the bottom group with 'a']
;W[fj];B[cj];W[ei];B[dj];W[gi];B[fl];W[hk]LB[hi:a][gg:b][hl:c]
C['a', threatening to link to the top is sente (B would not be able to stop the connection because of the threatened throw in at 'b')  With 'a' on the board W can then extend to 'c' and connect to the bottom.  It is a tenuous connection but it should be playable.]
;B[gk];W[fk]LB[hi:a]C[It is still not too late for 'a'];B[hl]
C[W is cut off from the bottom.  Prospects now are almost zero.  The reminder of the game is academic.  Black has won an easy victory.]

;B[ik];W[ji];B[lj];W[ij];B[hj]C[In this game W had a reasonable game until the invasion at 38.  This was the loosing move.  B took advantage to the full and never lost the lead after that.  W might still had had an outside chance but playing the dame point of 62 at a critical point sealed his fate.  After the exchange in the lower right (in which both players were thinking too locally) the lower left becase the largest area but neither player played there for some time.  When this area was eventually played W played at 92, which handed the game to B without any doubt.  Once B solidified the left side there was nowhere for W to start trouble, as he found when the stone on the left had nowhere to run.
There were several key points in this game where the balance cold have been changed significantly.  Of these, moves 38, 62, 65, 66, 82, 92 stand out the most.]
)
(;W[qq];B[oq];W[rp];B[qo];W[qp];B[qr]C[B has other options here which might stop W from making two eyes, but they are very risky because if they fail then B's position may fall apart.]
;W[rr];B[ps];W[sq];B[ro]LB[rs:a]C[If B plays 'a' he can get a ko in the corner but he is ahead and should aim to simplify.]
;W[rs];B[nn];W[iq]C[This move is why B should not have played 65 in the first place.  Follow the variation for B65 at 77 and you will see that W had to live in the corner in gote. Here it is in sente.]
))
(;B[nn];W[ln]LB[ri:a]C[W really cannot play this as the following sequnce shows.  In view of the B threat at 'a' W must defend the corner so B gets a strong attack against 50,62 and 64.]
;B[lq];W[kq];B[mq];W[jp]LB[rp:a][kp:b]C[This defensive move seems necessary but is unplayable because of B 'a'.  W must play the 3-3 point to live but then B cuts at 'b']

Although W gets a big territory at the top is can be flattened out by a B move at any one or more of the triangle points and 'e' is also sente in the yose for B.  W's territory will probably not be more than 30 points unless he invests further stones.  B's high speed development more than compensates.]

B also has sente so in view of all this the situation is uninteresting for W.]
