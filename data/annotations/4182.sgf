C[Commented by Niall ("NM")];B[pd];W[ep];B[pq];W[de]C[NM: I often use W's opening myself.]
;B[qk];W[nc];B[lc]C[NM: Good. Since W is going for
a big moyo, don't cooperate!];W[ne];B[pf];W[pb]C[NM: Not good. Best left, and later
W can decide whether to play this
or R17.];B[qc];W[kd];B[kc];W[jd];B[ld];W[le];B[jc];W[id];B[hc]
;W[md]C[NM: I think N15 is better, since it
guards better against the cut at 
L15. But the difference is small.];B[jp]C[NM: Good. Other possibilities
include H16, D17, D10 ...];W[po];B[np]C[NM: Good.];W[qq];B[qr]
;W[qp];B[rr];W[qm];B[ok];W[om];B[co]C[Now I think that simply c4 was better

NM: Yes, I think so. C4 is quite a
strong move when you already have
K4. Another possibility would
be somewhere round D9.];W[cp];B[dp];W[dq];B[do];W[cq];B[eo]
;W[fp];B[cj]C[NM: This is a fair result after the
original attack, but W's corner is
both bigger and more secure than
B's side.];W[fc]C[NM: This feels like an overplay,
although it is not obvious how best
to punish it. Perhaps G17?];B[hd]C[NM: This risks W's playing J18 and
a nasty fight.];W[ch];B[ej]C[NM: I think defending the weak
point at J18 is more urgent - 
perhaps G18? And after that I would
want to take the TL corner, e.g.
with C17.];W[fo];B[hq]C[NM: Big, but my comments on the
last move still stand.];W[bo];B[bn];W[dm];B[en]C[NM: Should be C7.]
;W[bp]C[Maybe C7 ?

NM: C7 is better, but still leaves
nasty weaknesses.];B[fn];W[bm];B[cm];W[an];B[cn];W[bl];B[cl]
;W[bk];B[bj]C[That's pointless.

NM: Fairly. If you want to
reinforce the group, G10?


I nown prefer M4, H5 or P12 (I am a little anxious about White invading the upper right while attacking P9).

NM: M4 is too small. If you're 
going to reinforce the bottom,
comething like K6 is needed. For 
the R, perhaps R18. But I think G18 is the most urgent.

What is the best move in the upper left ?

NM: C17 and C15 both look
interesting.



NM:];W[lp];B[nn];W[nm];B[mn]C[NM: If you want to attack M4, perhaps L5?]
;W[ko];B[mm]C[NM: Here I would play J6.];W[jo];B[nl]C[NM: That seems pretty pointless -
it neither makes territory nor
connects. H5 would be better.];W[rk];B[rj];W[rl];B[qj];W[rq]
;B[io];W[in];B[ho];W[hn];B[gn]C[Maybe G5, or not playing there at all to avoid shortage of liberties.

NM: I would cut at K6.];W[go];B[kq];W[mq];B[nq];W[gq];B[hr]
;W[jr]C[Looks like the bottom is dead now.

NM: Not while you have M3 then N2.];B[lr];W[mr];B[gr];W[fr]
;B[ir];W[km];B[ll]C[L2 would have lived.

NM: Yes, I think so.];W[kr];B[lq];W[ls]C[K3, threatening K1 and N4, would have lived.

NM: Yes];B[kp];W[ip])
