;B[pd]C[Thanks a lot for your time.
i played on kgs against player my lvl and while chasing his group i lost important group.
id like to know what things i missed.
thanks

crux: I'm Bernd Schmidt, around 2dan.  I'm too weak to tell you what the correct moves are, so please take this review as a set of suggestions what to think about in a game.  I've added variations in a couple of places.

I think maybe in this game you were too focused on chasing a group in order to kill it - an end result that is usually unlikely, unless there is more than one weak group on the board.  Try looking for ways to profit from an attack without going for a kill, and be prepared to abandon an attack temporarily when there's no good continuation.]

crux: Not so sure; territorially the other side is certainly bigger.]

(;B[km]C[crux: Might be better to attack from the other side where you can build up the moyo.  This move is on a neutral point, so maybe it would be better to let White play it.]

(;B[mc]C[crux: This doesn't work out too well as White connects, but I can't see an immediately killing attack either.

Maybe it would be best to lean on the other white group to chase it towards the top, where you can then possibly add stones to help you kill the other group.  See variation.]

(;B[li]C[crux: Seems like the wrong direction.  Black is strong near the top, so he should try pushing White in that direction, rather than helping him get out.]
