AB[pd][dp]C[PatLeTahi [6k\]: hi
PatLeTahi [6k\]: gg

Hagios: Hi, Hagios here.  In this game you made some simple mistakes which can easily be corrected.  Some attention to the fundamentals ought to show some quick improvement in your game.

Black appears to be a little bit stronger than you overall, so a loss can be expected with 2 stones.  Of course one problem with kyuu ranked players (myself included!) is that there is a tendency towards inconsistency, so it's also perfectly possible that black normally plays about at 8k level, but found the right moves this time luckily...]
;W[dc]C[unhiatus: Hi];B[pp]C[PatLeTahi [6k\]: french?]
(;W[qn]C[unhiatus: No

H: This is a matter of style, but as W I would prefer c6 next for two reasons:
- It aims to work with the d17 stone
- This side is the widest open side];B[ql]C[H: A pincer here is natural, hoping to work with the q16 stone.  So early, W has some delicate choices to make.  Personally, I would probably play a double kakari.]
(;W[on]C[H: This is acceptable, though I think I wouldn't play it in a handicap game.  Remember, in a handicap game we must strive to get more than we are allowed to expect.  If we strive for even results and don't attempt to force a mistake, then we will end up behind because of the disadvantage caused by the handicap stones.]

(;W[rp]C[H: Here is your first major mistake.  This s4 closes off the corner so white can't invade it later.]
;B[qq];W[qi]C[H: Here we can start to see a big problem.  You have a group without a base, which you're pushing your opponent's stone towards.  This is a dangerous idea]

(;W[cf]C[H: This creates two structures that want to extend along the top, but B will get to extend first, since he is sente.  That is the mistake in this move.]
;B[ic];W[jc]C[K17 seems not very good. Any better move for w here, please?

H: B is too thick in this area.  The only option for W is to reduce with the shoulderhit at k16]

(;W[fd]C[PatLeTahi [6k\]: thx
unhiatus: Thanks
unhiatus: Bye-Bye
I resign after this big midtake, but i was behind anyway...

H: If we ignore the bottom group's weakness, the game isn't too far behind.  B has a little more cash, and can attack W, so maybe a resignation wasn't a wrong choice here.  B's manner of play leads me to believe that he wasn't actually 8k, so you shouldn't feel too badly about losing this game.  If there is one main problem with your play, it's that you were eager to invade, and hesitant to build.  Even in a handicap game you should be willing to build your territories.  Invasions should happen at the last possible minute.]

(;W[ee];B[da];W[eb];B[fb];W[df]C[H: B still connects his group.  Attacking the W group should prove profitable for B.  Overall, this was an interesting game, not one to be unhappy about.]
