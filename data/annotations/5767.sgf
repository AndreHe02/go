AB[pd][dp]C[comment for teaching ladder:
I'm thankful for any kind of remark, some moves are pointed out specifically with the starting comment "comment for teaching ladder:"

Hi Georg,

I've taken note of the spots you've marked, and added my own.  

Enjoy!];W[pp];B[dc]C[comment for teaching ladder:

fuseki: comment on general built up of fuseki pattern is welcome]
;W[de];B[fd];W[cc]
(;B[dd]C[This is not the correct response; it leaves black with an uncomfortable shape, and as demonstrated in the next few moves, leaves white pretty happy; please see the variation.]
;W[cd];B[ee];W[df]C[Now white is securing fourth line territory.]
;B[ef]LB[jd:A]C[This push helps white secure more fourth line territory, which is even more painful.  Instead, I would recommend K-16 at A.]
;W[dg];B[db]C[This should be saved for the endgame (locally, the hane at C-18 is better).  White can now toss a stone in and split the top.]
;W[kc]C[These last few moves are, collectively, one of the smaller deciding parts of the game.]

(;B[nc]C[I'm a bit hesitant about pressing from this direction, because while black is thick on the other side, he's by no means settled, and it's a bit dangerous.  Please see the variation.]
;W[hc];B[qj]LB[qn:A]C[This feels a bit slack.  I would go all the way and approach at R-6.]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[jp];B[qn];W[np];B[cj]C[comment for teaching ladder:

considering white's next move, was this one too small?

Response:  The attachment with the next move isn't a big deal, it's more that Q-14 is a slightly bigger move.  It'll help indirectly with giving the unsettled group on the top left a little extra aid to run to, and possibly add a little more pressure to the two white stones at the top if they have to run away.   I'm still concerned about the top left group though, as white H-15 would be pretty severe.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[qe]
(;B[qh]C[This is a bit too aggressive.  All black needs to do is pull down at S-17.  Please see the variation.]
;W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[ob]C[This is overly passive. Black should try to confine white with Q-15.]
;W[pe]C[And that's why.];B[od]C[comment for teaching ladder:

in general too defensive?

Response:  Definitely.  Because of O-17, you don't need to be too concerned about a cut, and confining the corner group would be much better.]
;W[pl];B[on]C[I would've attached at R-8 to maintain the connectivity of black's stones. This also induces white to cap with N-6, and at the same time, develop the bottom.]
;W[mn];B[nm]C[Should attach at R-8 still.];W[ok];B[rl];W[fo]
C[After this, white is really happy; the result is one-sided, and ended up being the deciding part of the game. Black absolutely must do something about it now.]

(;B[rp]C[This removes the possibility of the 3-3 invasion.  You want to leave that open for later.  

Conservatively, I would play D-2, but that's not going to be enough points for black, so I recommend attaching to K-3 and making sabaki (i.e. if he responds with a hane, you can either crosscut or counter-hane; please see the variation for a sample).]
;W[qq]
(;B[rf]C[I would turn at P-15 immediately, because white should respond more aggressively than he did with S-15 (e.g. Q-13).]
;W[re];B[oe];W[pg];B[of];W[qg];B[rg]
(;W[oh];B[ph]C[This only helps white, but I'm also concerned about this working against black's potential attack on the two weak stones up top, as white is starting to push a bit more into the top, around the border.]
;W[og]TR[mf][nf][mg][ng]C[(i.e. white's a bit stronger there now, and is encroaching on that junction area)]
;B[cb];W[bb]
(;B[ch]C[I wouldn't be concerned about attacking this group right now, as black's got a much bigger problem to worry about (the group on the top left isn't looking totally comfortable).  This forces white to apply more pressure on the group above.  Please see the variation for one idea on how to launch the attack on the two white stones up top, and simultaneously begin to move yourself out into the center.]
;W[eh];B[lf]C[Black needs to move out from the other side; white has a perfect opportunity now with H-15.]
;W[fb];B[gc]C[I recommmend H-15 instead, as you don't want white to tighten up his stones.]
;W[gb];B[hd];W[ic];B[id];W[jd]C[This whole sequence only helps white secure his group, and removes any threats or aji for later.]
;B[gg];W[dr]C[comment for teaching ladder:

was there a real chance to play here before white?

Response:   Black didn't have many chances, since he had so much else to worry about, but I think his biggest opportunity was at move 40, instead of S-4.]
;B[cq];W[pj];B[qk];W[em];B[bf];W[be];B[cf];W[ce]
(;B[pi]C[This isn't necessary.   I would look at G-4 to begin some light reduction efforts, as white simply has too much territory (please see the variation for a sample).]
;W[oi];B[mm];W[ln];B[lm];W[kn]C[This helps white secure the bottom, but doesn't gain much in either the short or long term.]
;B[sd];W[se];B[sc];W[mk];B[nj];W[oj];B[nk]C[Would also consider N-10.]
;W[mh];B[kh];W[mj];B[nl];W[mf];B[me];W[nf];B[ni];W[nh];B[mg]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[kj];B[li];W[mi];B[lj];W[lk];B[ki];W[kl]C[comment for teaching ladder:

was it just technical failure to not kill the group or not to avoid anyway?

Response:  Killing it isn't an easy task.  I would've considered N-10 instead of O-9, but I don't see much else.]
;B[jj];W[km];B[ej];W[ba];B[ac]C[This doesn't work, as the B and C-14 stones need to be stronger (in that case, A-16 instead of A-17 could create a seki).]
;W[ad];B[af];W[bc];B[cg]C[Black doesn't need to strengthen this yet.]
;W[gh];B[eg]C[Black isn't gaining much by forcing white to connect, except make him stronger, and allow him to reduce some points below later.  Hane at H-12 instead.]
;W[dh];B[fh];W[fi];B[fg];W[ei];B[gk]C[D-8 is a pretty big move, and you can still reduce the area to the right afterwards.]
;W[gm];B[ae]C[It's much better to save this until the end, as this wastes a ko threat.]
;W[ab];B[rq]C[This is one of the bigger moves on the board, but I'd prefer K-15 or D-8.]
;W[rr];B[cr];W[dq];B[ep];W[fp];B[kk];W[ll];B[im];W[il];B[hl]
;W[hm];B[jl];W[in];B[jm];W[jn];B[ik];W[gi];B[hh]C[It's more important to cover up the other side (K-15).]
;W[jf];B[lb];W[jb];B[ig];W[lc];B[mc];W[kb];B[ng]C[Now's a great time to get D-8.]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[dj];B[dl];W[di];B[ci];W[fk];B[el];W[ek]

[bs]C[The deciding parts of the game were in the opening, on the top and bottom of the board.  Giving white the chance to split the top at L-17 was a problem, since black essentially fell behind a move or two before it, but the bottom was the most important area.  After white got F-5, black had to do something about that.
