AB[pd][dp]C[Mark: Thanks for reviewing the game.  I believe I need help with the first one hundred moves or so --- I lose by about 15 points, but I don't see any serious endgame issues.  In particular, I would appreciate advice on the top and bottom.  The question on move 67 is the crux for me.]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[ce]C[rs220675: Normally this move is alright since an enclousure has a lot of value. However, in a handicap game you must always overplay a bit anyway. So I think this move is not the best, because it gives black easy sente. It's too passive.]
;B[pj];W[jd];B[ci]
(;W[fq]C[Mark: I approach this corner since it's big and the gap between D4 and C11 is the largest.  However, looking back, I wonder if  approaching the bottom right wouldl be better.  Black is closer to building an effective double wing there.

rs220675: Well, in handicap games you'll always face situations where you opponent has an Fuseki-advantage. So I wouldn't worry too much about details, BUT F3 is a mistake, because there's a better (active) approaching move (see var.)]
;B[hq]
(;W[cq]C[Mark: I tend to jump to the 3-3 without thinking when I'm pinched.  I have a variation where I play C6 instead (and my opponent follows joseki).  I think it's better.

rs220675: I do the same and this is OK. The jump at 3-3 settles the situation for white right away. I don't think your variation is better/worse, just suits a different, more aggressive, style of play.]
;B[cp]C[rs220675: This Black move is actually not good because C11 is just on the thrid line. One could reduce the developing moyo too easy and effective.]
;W[dq];B[fp];W[ep];B[eo];W[eq];B[fo]
(;W[bp]C[Mark: As a result of this hane, black solidifies his position and the stone at C11 becomes a good extension.  I have some variations where I cut at D5, but it's unclear to me if this is the best time to try this.

rs220675: Esp. in Fuseki the concept of sente is very important, i.e. being able to dictate the game and not just to react. In an handicap game this applies even more since you need to run behind a lead right from the beginning. Therefore I consider B4 a mistake, because it's too slow. Your white group is living and out of any immediate danger, so look for the big points like at O17 or O3.]
;B[bo];W[bq];B[cn]C[rs220675: This move is not necessary, so Black could have easily played a bigger point somewhere else.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[jq];B[pn];W[jo]C[Mark: When I read joseki, Kogo's says that this moves stabilizes the group.  However....

rs220675: This move is not neccessary and too slow in fuseki. A move at N5 would be much more urgent since it prevents black from pushing white down small while developing a whopping big moyo for himself. And Black did exactly that....]
;B[mo]C[Mark: .... I feel like I have to respond to this move (even though there are bigger moves on the board).  In the variations, I don't see good options if I tenuki.  Am I missing something?]
(;W[lp]C[rs220675: Good move. Making a significant group stable is more important than any other socalled big point - always.]
;B[lo]
(;W[ko]C[Mark: I believe I can ignore this approach and play away (as in the variation).

rs220675: No, you can't. You played right here, see my var.]
;B[gd];W[nc]LB[mc:A]C[Mark: I was very unsure of this move ---- I wanted to defend the K16 stone and attack, but I didn't see a good attack on the G16 stone.  Thus, I approached the corner instead.  However, I think this extension is too wide (with A a better choice).

rs220675: I think you did OK. You don't need to attack an invading stone immediately; actually that's often one of the best attacks - leave the invasion alone and come to it back later when you have more influence. Often people attack an invading stone too harsh and direct and that often only strengthens the whole invasion, so your move at O17 is actually a real good move.]
;B[ld];W[ne]C[rs220675: Good.];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc]
(;W[qb]C[Mark: Here I _think the variation is better --- I have a chance to link up stones and put more pressure on G16.

rs220675: The actual and the alternative move are not good because too slow. Remember: In the early stage of a game there must be some serious reason to play stones on the second row! The move to play here is O13. It reduces the black moyo further and puts more pressure on the single black stones plus stabilizes the whole group there (which can be important for your stone at K16).]
;B[mb];W[mc];B[lc]
(;W[nb]C[Mark: I think the variation is better.

rs220675: Yeah, seems to.];B[jc];W[ic];B[kb];W[jb];B[kc];W[id]
;B[lf];W[ng];B[ni];W[me];B[le];W[mh]C[rs220675: Here already you lose the game if your opponent continues to play sound.

1. You have a weak group at J17. Black too, so probably both groups will live somehow.
2. You have a stable group that will make maybe 8-10 points at Q18...do you see how much black will gain on the right side through chasing your group?

Don't worry about the following sequences. Your problem are small moves that cost you sente in fuseki or middle game. First you didn't play N5 and therefore black could develop a nice moyo there. Then you played R18 which settles the group but also enables black to gain sente and a lot of influence and territory while your upper right group lives small.

I finish here because the next moves are typical 6-10k moves one could go round and round. But the concept of sente and not playing small moves in fuseki is more important to emphasize.

Don't play a small moves like R18 or B4, giving away sente in an early stage of the game...only if it'S real necessary because the group would be very weak otherwise.]

LB[rc:A]C[Mark: Okay, I think the major issues of the game are involved with these top groups.  My top right group is fairly okay as long as I have the turn at A.  The middle top group has issues, but the same is true of black's.  I thought I was in a superior position here, but I ended up with difficulties.  I don't know if I'm evaluating the position incorrectly or if I made mistakes in trying to kill/control the center top black group.]
