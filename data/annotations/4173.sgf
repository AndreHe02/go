C[Hi!
I'm especially interested in the beginning, since I think he got the better
 of it there. Later on, I think I had the game under control. Any advice, e
specially of the strategic kind, is much appreciated.
Regards,
Niklas

Cool,
I like fuseki alot, and this is actually my strong point. :)
I'll try and keep my explainations as simple as possible :)

Enjoy];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq];W[op];B[lp];W[hp]LB[fo:A]
C[Here is the first point of interest for me. This was my first game where 
I tried the mini-chinese, and I didn't really know which pincer was the best against p4. Since h4 was a quite severe pincer, maybe I should have answered. Or maybe I should have answered differently in the lower right corner.
..

Mini-Chinese is one of my favourite openings. The play at P4 isn't standard, and not that good.
The right spot here is to answer, at A. since your one step ahead the outcome should favour you.
Personally though, i would not pincer the P4 stone, as i don't think it has
 any severe follow-ups. As soon as you pincer, he is forced to counter, and that i do not like :)

The Stragety behind A is very simple, and something you always should think of :)

- In a fight (or upcoming) always keep your stones connected, and his stones apart -

I'm sure you've heard that, but keep it in mind always

I've made a small variation so, you can get a picture of it. 
Pretty simple moves :)]
(;B[pn];W[fp];B[pp]C[I really wanted to add that stone , 
but somehow I feel like white has taken the initiative.

Yeah, black is a move behind...];W[di];B[jd];W[hd];B[qf]C[I thought this was an indirect way of supporting k16 and makin the right side less attractive to white...

Good thinking!]
(;W[md]LB[jf:A]C[..but I was no to sure how to answer this move. It looked 
a little loose, so I thought I could take the corner and run with k16.

This is not a good move from white, he is ahead and should not try any funny-business.

I would take the initiative as black, and play something like A
Iv'e made a variation of what i would have like white to play...]
;B[oc]C[Same as before : Keep your stones connected, and his stones appart]
;W[mf];B[le];W[me];B[jf];W[mh];B[kh]C[23: This move I'm not so sure about, 
since I had to come back (I thought) and cover up my weaknesses. What would have been a better development for me here?

This is not a bad move at all];W[pi];B[pk]C[25: I didnt want w to get a foothold: but maybe this is the wrong direction - maybe I should have played m10 instead, forcing him to gain a small life and bilding power against his left side framework?

Yes, Good thinking!];W[mj];B[lg];W[og]C[This seemed like a really bad exchange for me. 
What would have been a better approach?

I think you're being too hasty with conclusion :) 
This move looks fancy, yes.. but it's nothing else, 
I think a straight-out connection would be better

Theres a variation that shows the bad shape]
(;B[kj];W[qk];B[ql];W[pj];B[ok]C[33: taking the side with r10 seemed really small,
 but I thought he got a good deal here. Improvements?

White is making everything 10 times better for black, 
and you followed perfectly :)];W[ml];B[kl];W[rl];B[rk]C[R 7 is better... You might have had a chance to kill white]
;W[qj];B[qm];W[rm];B[rn];W[rj];B[sm];W[sk];B[cq]C[I couldn't wait any longer. 
Was this the best point or is there a better approach?

I think the corner is not so interesting, as you cannot use your influence 
in that area Maybe D9 is better];W[cp];B[gq];W[dq]C[wow....]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[go];W[fm];B[gn];W[fn];B[mm]C[shielding off the lower side like this, I felt that I got a good deal here. 
I was thinking about approaching the upper left side instead but I
 thought he couldn't seal everything off by only one move anyway, 
so I preferred this.

Correct.];W[hf]C[This felt like a loose play. 
Wouldn't it be better to d15 or c15?

It would yes];B[ce]C[It really looked like I could live down here...]
;W[bd];B[cg];W[bh]C[This move is too passive, should be at E15]
;B[ee];W[fc]C[f16 must be better. Now I get a peep "for free"

Right];B[ge];W[he];B[ch]C[...and can quite easily live.];W[ci]

C[feels like the wrong direction, since I cant get thourgh there anyway. 
Now it feels like I get the key point here...

I just think he can kill you now....];B[hl]C[Now I thought I was ahead.]

(;W[af]C[Do you live, if he plays D14 first? I might have missed something

The game is over after A 14 though, Good game];B[ag];W[ae];B[df]
;W[im]C[I thought this was a way of squeezing (like in  alternative B), but
 I was happy to get sente and play a large point if he did.]
;B[il]LB[on:A][jl:B]
(;W[on];B[om]C[93: This gives a lot more "inner" aji, but I looked for a wh
ile without finding anything so I played here instead of cowardly play unde
rneath.];W[gm];B[hm]C[This seemed to me to take away some aji for white.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[rg];B[er]C[This looked like the biggest point on the board because of it being double sente and I had a good follow up. But I am unskilled in the endgame, so if you want please play out what you think is the best, sequence. For a while I thought about playing n18 instead tp be on the safe side in regards to the corner group, but it looked quite safe anyway.

The game is already over, and besides this is good enough];W[dr]
;B[ic];N[RESULT]C[Result: B+Resign

He resigned without giving it a fight, but indeed it looks like I'm ahead a
 bit.])

(;B[in]C[..and squeeze if I played here.
 But I was thinking of playing g9 and gaingin enough liberties to win a sem

(he should not, it's dangerous),
Black could move out like this ...

But this technique is not appropriate here.]))

(;W[if];B[kf];W[jh];B[lh]C[I know this probably won't happen,
but this just illustrates whites moyo being bigger. 
If he can do it while threatning the black moyo, he will have a better game.]
