C[yo, i played this game as black as an 18 kyu vs another 18 kyu. i lost by about 4.5 points, wow, what a loss, and i thought i did make some stupid mistakes. please point them out for me, thx.

Hello,

I'm about 10 kyu, so it is quite likely that some of my comments aren't accurate, or, in some cases, just plain wrong. However, I tried to explain how I see things, and I hope this will be helpful.

I didn't comment much on the fuseki and the yose, the former because I'm not very good at it, and the latter because it is not very important at your level.

This is possible, but I think it might be simpler to take care of the marked stone first.]

I think you should exchange A for B before playing this move. This makes a nice shape and protects the cut at C (see variation).]
;W[hp]C[resisting my effort to close them off but...

--
Because of the cut at G4, you can't close him, anyway. It looks like you're trying to attack a group using a weaker group ; this isn't very cautious.]
;B[io];W[gp];B[jq]LB[go:A][fq:B]TR[kq]C[--
It doesn't look like you can separate the marked stone...
A is probably better ; you sacrifice the B stone and get some aji for a later san-san invasion.]

C[-- 
This is bad, because you have two cutting points (A and B). If white simply answers at C, he can the cut you.

It would be better to give up the marked stone for the moment and keep the san-san invasion for later.]

This is very painful for black.];B[en];W[fm];B[do];W[co];B[eo]
;W[dm];B[cr]LB[em:A]C[--
This is a bad move ; you have no time for that, and should push at A. See variations.]

(;W[br]LB[em:A]C[-- 
I think white should play at A ; the idea is to repair your big weaknesses before trying to kill, or you won't succeed.

Anyway, this would be more simple.];B[em];W[fl];B[el];W[kn]
LB[fk:A]C[--
Maybe white should push once more at A.];B[fk]LB[hm:A]TR[fl]
[fm][fn]C[i became the attack target for white.

--
Yes, and all this because you were greedy when you played D2...

This is a good move (nice shape), and it helps one of your groups. 

However, the fighting is now quite difficult for black, as there are two weak black groups.]
;W[hm]
(;B[gk]LB[hn:A]C[-- 
It is quite difficult to save both groups, but if you want, you must first connect at A (it is sente, see variation). 

The idea is that if white has no weakness, then the fight will be much easier for him, and you'll probably lose it.

I included a not too complicated variation where black kindof stabilizes both groups.]

LB[nc:A]C[-- 
This sequence, in particular the order of the moves, seems weird. 

Playing A to leave it and come back one move later is strange. Well, dan players do such kind of things, this is called probe (yosumiru), but I suspect they know what they are doing. I think you should (both) play simpler moves, that you can understand.]
;B[md]LB[ic:C][md:A][nd:B]C[-- 
The forcing move at A (for white B) is useless, it only makes white stonger. Better to play directly at C.]

This kind of defends against the white invasion at A, but it leaves some aji in the area. I'd rather play something like B or C or D to erase the aji instead of trying to get a few yose points.]

(;W[oo]LB[oo:B][pq:A]TR[nc][nd][ne]C[-- 
White should first stabilize his groups before trying to reduce black. The marked stones can get under heavy attack, even if are not likely to die. Also the top left corner isn't completely safe either.]

C[-- 
Bad move : a go proverb says "don't push behind". You are just making a few points here ; it would be better to attack the white top right group, starting with A or B.

Plus, by pushing white into this area, you lose the opportunity to be able to play somewhere around C during the attack of the top right white stones, and to make profit there.]
;W[pl]TR[nc][nd][ne]C[good shape at bottom right corner, i feel that i am leading a bit

-- 
Not really ; as white has 10 captured stones (ie 20 points), and komi, I think he is just a bit ahead on territory. 
However, white has a group that could get quite weak (the marked stones), but maybe it's okay for white because he has a lot of strength in the center.

All in all, I think the game is still close.];B[ql];W[pj];B[ng]

I didn't comment much on the yose, because I don't think it is very important at your level. Besides, it seems that your yose was better that white's.

I think your main weakness is that you (and the same holds for your opponent) don't pay enough attention to the stability of your groups; you really should try to play more solidly instead of trying to catch a few more points.

If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to email me, or to contact me on KGS, my nick is linfir.

I hope you find this useful,
