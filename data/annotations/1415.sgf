;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[dc];B[de];W[fd]C[you played d13. While your two stones were conected they:
didnt make any territory
were susceptible to a strong attack
in the best case W could have taken the corner in sente by playing c16

If you didnt respond to c16 white c11 would put blac in a very uncomfortable position.

A possible way to play in the variation];B[dg];W[nq];B[oq];W[np]

;B[hc];W[bc];B[cd];W[cc];B[cn];W[fp];B[cp]C[I was thinking that maybe this move should have been played at C3.

or b4 follwed by W c3 B c9];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[do];W[ep]C[At this point I wasn't sure where the next big point for Black was on the board. First I thought H15. Then Q10 or R10. Then I thought O6 but I was worried about  W playing P4. I eventually settled on D9.]
;B[dk]C[Looking at this after the game it may have been better to play F6 or F14 if I was going to play on the left side.

I myself would have played c9];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[jc]
;B[je]C[Was this a mistake?

Looks odd. I would choose J16 or h15
H15 would probably be my choice as giving most flexibility]

Look at the vars]
(;W[ke];B[jf];W[kd];B[qj];W[qh];B[oi]C[TL corner is more important   At the same time try to imagine W f6 and W o6 played !

F6 might b the best point for you now (accept for rescuing the bottom group)]

(;B[gg];W[hg];B[hh];W[ig]
(;B[jg]C[I guess you wanted to save the 2 stones. Generally it is a good idea not give stones away but in this case consider this:
They are worth 4 point in gote for white
If you play j12 and he will take them with r13 you calmy give them up and play f6  The result of this exchange will be:
whatever you get between f5 and j16 stones (at least 20 points and if compared with loses sustained in actual game MUCH more) minus 4 little points in gote.
REMEMBER after your f6 white has to respond otherwise your moyo will keep on expanding !!!]
;W[ih];B[hi];W[ii];B[ji];W[ij];B[hj];W[hk]C[Having got myself into this position I was worried about giving White most of the center and didn't want to let my string of stones on the K line die.

"There is no territory in the centre" as the proverb says any way.

The main concearn are the stones on th e k line which are worth too much now. At the same time h9 means a possibility of a huge reduction of your territory.]

yes];W[mh];B[mi];W[ng];B[og];W[ri];B[rj];W[sj];B[fa]C[I think this was a wasted stone playing here at this time.
one point in gote - you are correct  Yose is the weakest part of my game so I will try to refrain from comments]

(;W[qe];B[nh];W[mg];B[kf]C[Another mistake.

a 6 point loss to a player stronger by 5 stones in an even game is nothing to be ashamed of !

Try studing more problems (I recommend Kano Yoshinori's Graded go problems for beginners vol 1 2 3 and 4) this should keep you busy until about 5 kyu.

Life and Death by J Davies is also great thou might be a bit difficult   Good luck]
