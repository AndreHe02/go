RE[W+4.50]

C[Hey, Laurie. You requested general overall help with a specific focus on san-san, or 3-3, invasions. So, I'll do just that.

Quick note: the way I've formatted this SGF is that you should read variations before the actual play. The SGF read MultiGo does so by default, and is freeware. However, the Kiseido client CGoban can also be used.

First of all, why does a san-san invasion work? That's because of the hoshi's, or 4-4's, purpose.]
;B[pp]C[The hoshi. One of the crowning achievements of modern Go. Unfortunately, when I was a beginner, I misunderstood the purpose of this play. Since Go is a game to capture territory, surely, the hoshi is meant to do that, right? So I, too, feared the san-san invasion.

Here's what I needed to realize, and what will help you, too:

THE HOSHI IS NOT MEANT TO CAPTURE TERRITORY.

The hoshi is played to quickly develop a game based on influence. Influence is strength in an area created by well-placed stones that either give great fighting strength by reducing an invasion's wiggle room (thus indirectly making territory) or making territory directly if your opponent does not get close to it.

Thus, the hoshi is forsaking the corner! The san-san point is completely open, and usually, there is nothing that can be done about it. However, walk through the variation to see why the invasion is bad.]

(;W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[qf];W[qe]CR[jd][pj]C[When White played this move, you had a chance to take a big advantage. This is the beginning of a joseki, but unless White has a stone at K16 or Q10 (circles), it feels as though Black gets a huge advantage over White. Follow the joseki in the variation to see why.]

(;B[pi]CR[pf]C[However, you played this. In this contact situation, Q14 (circle) strengthens the Black stone and sets up a beautiful double extension from the hoshi and the two-stone wall. This move unfortunately abandons the R14 stone and sets up an unfortunate situation in which Black if forced to play low while White claims the top and some of the center for himself.

See variation.]
(;W[jd]TR[pi]SQ[pp]LB[nd:B][cf:C][pf:A]C[Since White jumped straight to the end of the sequence, ignoring his kikashi, or forcing plays, Black has a chance to remedy the situation somewhat. Black can try exchanging A for B, then playing at C, but the Black stone at Q11 (triangled) is too close to Black A and a little too far away from Q4 (squared). Nevertheless, this is probably the best choice.]
;B[pl]LB[cf:B][pf:A][jp:C]C[This move only compounds the problem. The only explanations for this move are (1) trying to fix a problem caused by Black's last move and (2) trying to make territory. The second is contrary to not only to the purpose of the hoshi, but also to the purpose of Q8 itself. For the purpose of territory, a play at R8 is more balanced between the third and fourth lines, thus enabling construction of territory. But as it is, Black has now spent three moves to take the right side, whereas White used one to take the top. Preferrable to this move are Q14 (A), C14 (B), and K4 (C).]
;W[pf];B[qg];W[pg];B[ph]TR[qf][qg]C[White came around to the sequence I had predicted earlier, after move 7.

You may have wondered why I had put Black's last move at R12. There is a general principle that, when in a pushing battle, you don't make a series of two-stone groups. That's because the cutting points are absolutely catastrophic.

In this situation, Black still has a chance for a san-san invasion.Because a fight in the corner will build strength against the triangled Black group, it is best to have that group as secure as possible. If you will recall, you lost these stones because you weren't mindful of them.]
;W[mf]LB[dj:B][cn:A]C[This move is too small to play in the opening. A kakari, or approach, at A or an extension at B is far bigger at this point. Because this move is small, Black can take sente and play a big move for free.]
;B[cf]C[Nicely done. If you look at the board, Black's stone seems to squash White's top down, decreasing its influence on the center of the board.]
;W[ce];B[dh]LB[dj:A]C[This move is even smaller than Q11. The advantage gained from grabbing the big point is greatly diminished. It is not completely gone, though, but a recovery will be tough.]
;W[df];B[cg];W[fp]C[White wastes no time securing his position and grabbing one of the most important points on the board. By no means is White catching up, though. The joseki in the following variations will quickly settle the position and secure Black to plow ahead.]

(;B[dn]C[See the variation on White's next move for the proper continuation.]

(;W[eo]C[Never play a move that helps your opponent more than it helps you! This move forces Black to do exactly what he wants to do: build strength against White's group, defend the left side more strongly, decrease the odds of the success of a san-san invasion, and take the lead in the corner so that he can leave should he so desire. James Kerwin 1P calls this a "thank you" move.]
;B[do];W[en];B[ep]LB[ck:A][jp:B]C[I find it hard to comment on this move... it never would have occurred to me, and I cannot criticize the thought. I myself would have either extended to A or pincered at B. The only criticism that this move can incur comes from your follow-up.]
;W[fq];B[eq]CR[dp][ep]LB[fo:A]C[This is rarely a good move. The formation created by the three marked stones is called the "empty triangle," and considered the greatest example of inefficient play. If you were going to defend at E3, you should have done so instead of E4. Instead, you lost sente and spent two moves to go the point you wanted in the first place.

If you played E4 to fight the White group, you should have cut at A. White would be forced to concentrate on one group at a time, making it difficult to make them live. Most likely, you would have killed one or the other, but let's not get our hopes up. Summarized, you should not push a connection unless you are prepared and willing to cut.]
;W[er]LB[ck:A][jp:B]C[This is an endgame move. If Black responds, White would be unable to pull off a san-san invasion in the corner. Black's best response is to leave, and play either A or B. Even if White plays the san-san in this condition, it is gote, and then Black could take the other big point.

Throughout this game, actually, it seemed as though you felt compelled to defend everything that White tried to take. It is always best to consider just how big the threat is before responding. Often times, when I leap to defend against an invasion, I miss a bigger threat I had to play.]
;B[dr];W[fs]LB[ds:A]C[If you want to defend against a cut along the wall like this,I would generally adivse a solid connection. That leaves fewer ko threats, and if your opponent leaves, you can come back and wreak havoc with the hane at A.

Other than that, this is an endgame move, and whould not be played now.]
;B[ds]LB[jp:A]C[Again, Black did not have to respond. However, Black has more liberty to play relaxed than White: he just took at least sixteen points of territory, and White has made a a wall facing Black's wall on the right side. Simply put, White did not get his moves' worth.

However, I would have played A now. That way, White will be hard pressed to save his groups.]
;W[jp]LB[ck:A][mq:B][nq:C]C[This is pretty much the last move of the opening. Let's see how White and Black are doing:

Black: approx. forty moku
1 strong formation, 1 flexible formation, 1 weak formation
- a solid group in the lower left netting at least sixteen moku
- a weak group in the upper left side that may have four moku
- a strong right side worth at least eighteen moku; an invasion of the right side would help Black make territory elsewhere; no invasion would result in around moku point.

White: approx. fifty-two moku
2 flexible, settled formations
- an open upper side worth around thirty-seven moku; however, both corners are open to invasion, and the upper left is wide enough to invade safely
- a settled formation in the bottom worth maybe twelve moku

Though the numbers seem to favor White, the board is actually in Black's favor. You could either defend at A and add another fifteen moku to your left side and settling your one liability on the board, or ypu could attack the group on the bottom at B, adding maybe twelve more points while taking away White's extension at B or even C.]
;B[em]LB[cj:A][mq:B]C[This move is not necessarily bad, but White can affor to lose those two White stones. He is free to take either A or B. If he wants to play A, now would be the right time to do so.]
;W[fm]C[Black has a cruel response to this move. See the variation.]

(;B[el]C[This is not a bad move, but it is not as fun to play.]
;W[fl];B[fk];W[im]LB[hl:A]C[An interesting response. It builds White's moyo by about eight moku. I probably would have played A instead, but that is slower, weaker, and definitely does not feel balanced. Nice, White.]
;B[gk]C[I don't know if you saw it, but this move is very dangerous to White. Try to figure out why before checking th variation.]

(;W[hl]C[This move prevents the last sequence.];B[kq]LB[mq:A]
[nq:B]C[A nice move. It's well-timed, and settles the extension issue along the bottom fairly well. Just realize that White could have jumped in at either A or B and started a nasty fight.]
;W[km]C[I don't see how this move confronts the situation at all. Black gets a free move to attack White and settle the bottom. See variation.]

(;B[mp];W[lp]C[You had a nasty response here, too.]
(;B[lq];W[kp];B[jq];W[iq]
(;B[nq]C[This move allows White to climb on top of Black, reducing Black's moyo. White can still try a san-san invasion, which will probably work.]
;W[mo];B[no];W[mn];B[mi]C[This is probably not the biggest move on the board... I myself would invade at H4. However, this quickly settles the problem of White's growing influence in the center, and Black is far enough ahead to play safely like this.]
;W[nh];B[ni];W[mh];B[qc];W[pc]C[Black can live. Followin is the sequence.]

(;B[qd]MA[qh]C[This move is damaging to Black. Because Black is not connected at the X, Black has to try to save his invasion and the two stones.]

;B[ra];W[pa]LB[sb:A]C[Again, White missed his point for the seki at A.]

(;W[gd];B[gc];W[fb];B[fa];W[ed];B[gb];W[fe];B[fc];W[hd]C[Black has another fun move here.]

(;B[ic];W[jc];B[jb];W[kb];B[ib];W[id];B[fg]LB[gg:A]C[This move is a little greedy. At this point, Black stands to win. When you are ahead, it is usually best to play in such a way that secures your lead. This means settling situations quickly, and without fights.

That being said, I must confess I would play a similar greedy move *shame*. That move would be A, and the variation shows why.]

(;W[gf];B[gg];W[hg];B[hh];W[ig];B[ih];W[jh];B[ji];W[kh];B[ki]
;W[ii]C[White played too far in! Black can take this stone by playing the point White should have played: J10. See the variation.]

(;B[hi];W[ij];B[hj];W[ik];B[ml]LB[nn:A][nm:B]C[I don't know what to say about this move... it's intruiging. It does not secure much, if any, territory, and White did not stand to make much there, either. It does not by any means settle the situation around A and B, either of which I probably would have played.

Despite this, it feels right. Territory is not one of Black's concerns... the game should be his. This move steps out boldly and makes the position in the center far more comfortable for Black. My moves at A and B forget Black's stones near the tengen (K10), and does not support them at all.

I've looked through this game at least five times, and each time, I've sat and stared at this move. This move is mysteriously satisfying.]
;W[li];B[lj];W[kj];B[lh];W[lg];B[li];W[lk];B[mk];W[kl]LB[nn:A]
C[This was White's last serious chance to play A. Those two White stones are far smaller than White's threat here.]
;B[ll]C[Black should have played O6 now. This move is small, even in the endgame (maybe three points).]
;W[kk];B[nn];W[qq]C[Okay, the second san-san. Let's evaluate the position.

Black has strength to the left of the hoshi. Black can easily make living difficult by pushing White toward this strength. Note that I said "difficult," not "impossible." White can fight for life.

Let's look at the board to judge the situation. Black has about fifty points on the left side alone! All of White's territory on the top does not equal that. If Black lets White live and settles the situation quickly, he will still win. There is no need to lose territory in a desparate life-or-death battle here.

Black can toy with White, lose maybe fifteen points of territory, then play some big endgame. He's fine.

In the san-san to come, I will note the life status of the White group, because it changes several times.]
;B[qp]C[This is the correct move. This move will help minimize losses, even if White lives.]
;W[pq]LB[rp:A]C[White played the wrong move. To have a chance in this situation, White must play A.

The following variation on Black's play shows the best White can try to live.]

(;B[oq];W[rp];B[rq]C[No. This forces White to play S2, which is a point he needs to form two eyes. Sacrificing the stone here helps White out. Play S5 instead.

White will probably live. Black can either try to trick White or play solidly, but either way should have the same result.]
;W[rr]C[See the variation for an alternate Black play (the trick attempt).]

(;B[ro];W[sp];B[so]LB[pr:A]C[I would advise playing A now, while it is sente. Nevertheless, you should have been fine.]
;W[sq];B[pr];W[qo]C[Though this looks like a good move, White missed his last real chance. White missed the necessary point at R2. Now Black can kill White again.]
;B[qr]C[Correct.

From this point on, White should be dead.];W[rn];B[rq];W[qq]
;B[pq];W[rq];B[rs];W[sn];B[qn];W[qm];B[pn];W[rl];B[ql];W[sl]
LB[rm:A][ro:B]C[Believe it or not, White is dead!

You were probably searching for the silver bullet in this situation. The truth is, you had two.

Look: White needs to play two moves to make two eyes: A and B. If you play either of those first, White can no longer make two eyes. See the variation.

So, Black should have left. Continue reading until move 168 to see some hints regarding endgame.]

(;B[pm];W[rm];B[qk]C[Forgive me if this sounds harsh, but you missed your chance at the last moment. The truth is that this play does nothing but give White a chance to live. White could not cut there.]
;W[ro]CR[be]MA[da][ka][ir]C[White is now alive. Now begins the endgame.

As bad as the situation may seem now, Black is still ahead. Granted, the lead is not so large now, but now that the situation on the right is finished, Black has sente, and can thus make his lead bigger.

In the endgame, it is important to play the "big points" first. Big points in the endgame are (in order of importance) points both players can play in sente (double sente), points only one player can play in sente (sente for that player, reverse sente for the other), and gote that are worth a lot of points. It is always best to play double sente first.

The big points on this board are marked as follows:
X: sente
O: reverse sente
( there are no big gote plays... )

You can play ALL of these big points. I would suggest the following variation.]

(;B[po];W[sk];B[rj];W[eg];B[eh];W[ff];B[dg];W[ef];B[fh];W[cq]
C[The final san-san invasion. Let's assess the situation.

White has played against a solid Black wall, save for one cutting point. It certainly feels like White should at least be in a lot of trouble, if not dead.

Well, feelings are useful in Go; they can find things that reading cannot (at times; I'm not saying don't think!). The variation shows the quickest way to kill White.]

(;B[dq]C[This move is not as surprising as C2, but Black can still kill.]
;W[cp]LB[bn:A][br:B]C[Here, you have two options: A and B. Both of these moves are as final as C2.

Note: These moves do NOT work against most san-san invasions. Here, however, you have a solid wall on top of it.]
;B[cr];W[co];B[cn];W[bn]C[Here, B7 is the most natural response. See the variation.]

(;B[bq];W[bp]C[Black should play A4. See the variation.]
(;B[bm]C[This was the first bad move in the fight against the invasion. Black gave White a free eye around the stone at B2.

Nevertheless, it merely made the battle more complicated, not unwinnable. White should die.]
;W[br];B[an];W[bs];B[ap];W[aq];B[bo]C[You commented that you missed A5 here. You are correct; A5 was your last chance to definitely kill White.]
;W[ao];B[bn]MA[dk]LB[be:A][bd:B][ap:C][bq:D]C[You had a ko battle; you should have fought.

One of your best ko threats was at A. White would probably respond at B to save the corner territory. Then you'd recapture the ko at C. Now White has to find a threat that is big enough... but there isn't one. No matter what White plays next, you should play D and win the corner back.

Your last question was whether you should have played E9 ( X ) as you did later in the endgame. The answer is that you did not need to. Even with the White walls finished, you were okay. See the variation.]

C[This was a well-played game. You made excellent frameworks and forced White to play desperately. Had you seen the moves to kill the san-san invasions, your hard work would have been evident in the score.

In closing, try to remember these things:
(1) Play moves that are harmonious with the stones already on the board. This is especially important in the opening.
(2) Make plans after looking at the board. You should analyze the board after every forced sequence at the very least.
(3) Remember the killing and surprise tesuji I showed you. Similar positions will occur in other games!
(4) In the endgame, play moves that your opponent REALLY does not want you to play first.

If you learn to use these, the instinctive good thoughts you showed will be complimented by your play, and your rematch against this person will be a game with no regrets.

Black has no choice but to claim a little territory, about six points, and to hope to catch up. Now Black is a step behind instead of White.

Black has, in three moves, made a strong flexible formation against White and claimed the entire right side for his moyo. Will he get all of it? Of course not. But he will get some of it, and the influence he has along the side will enable him to attack White invasions out into the middle of the board, getting profit elsewhere.

Again, if White had a stone at K16, White would have similar influence on the entire top side of the board, and have sente, or initiative, to take another big point. If White had a stone at Q10, Black's approach at R14 would instead have been an invasion, and would not have been a good move at this point. But as it stands, Black has done marvelously, and White is a step behind.

Because this is also what Black wanted.

Because the hoshi forsakes the corner, it has to focus out into the center of the board. After all, it's closer to it than any of the other opening moves. So, when White invades like this, Black happily plays outside of the corner AND MAKES INFLUENCE WITH EVERY MOVE!

Let's compare the results. White has struggled in the corner, where every move he made was required to live. The result? He gets at most seven secure points of territory, (marked as squares on the board).

Black, on the other hand, has made a lot of valuable influence (marked as triangles). While he has made no territory, he definitely has made a lot of fighting strength. His wall has no weaknesses, and a stone at K4 (marked as a circle) uses the wall beautifully to make a moyo, or framework around potential territory.

In case you are still confused as to how the triangled area is Black's influence, watch te following example.]
;W[lp];B[jp]C[White has played within Black's influence, and Black strikes back easily. White has little, if any, room to make life, so he needs to run up and out... along Black's wall! White is hard pressed the entire time, while Black has a massive juggernaut bullying him. The result is that White ends up with a meager life, and Black gets either more influence than he started with, territory that more than compensates for White's life in the corner and White's life with the invading group, AND he has been attacking the whole time.

If this is how a san-san invasion turns out, why would anyone want to play it? After move one, Black had no other stones to interact with on the board. Thus, Black could respond as he pleased to White's invasion. But when Black already has a larged moyo and little room to make up for the loss of territory represented by the corner, then a san-san invasion becomes a powerful weapon.

Moral of the story: when playing the hoshi, NEVER expect to make territory in the corner. If you do get it though, make sure it is not because you tried desperately to get it at the expense of the hoshi's true purpose.
