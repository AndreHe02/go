B[oc]
C[B9. A mistake! should be at either P18 or S18. this leaves S18 as a big move for W later. B's formation is also too open on the left after the text.]
;W[qh];B[dq];W[op]
C[W12. Too slow. Puts all of W's stones on one side of the board, and not urgent in any event. A splitting play at J17 instead is more attractive to me, and either C5 or D5 also seem reasonable.]
;B[ed]
C[B13. This puts B ahead overall, but not by much, and given his mistake in the upper right corner B would have been better advised to play this stone at E17.]
;W[do];B[co];W[dp]
C[W16. I believe that the position calls for the outside hane at C6 instead. This has to be bad for W.]
;B[cp];W[eq];B[dr];W[cn]
C[W20. This has to be bad! B is already alive, and W has just saddled himself with 2 dangerous cutting points! At this point W more or less has no option but to extend at D6, giving these stones the 5 liberties they need for stability! This is a very important concept that you evidently are not aware of. ]
;B[er]
C[B21. Fails to punish W's error. Either cut, but especially the one at C6, is better.]
;W[dm]
C[W22. Repairs the defect, but W is far less well off than if he had played W20 at D6 because then he could extend now at F3 to create impressive thickness to coordinate with his right side stones.]
;B[fq];W[cj]C[W24. Unfortunately necesary to stabilize the W stones. ]
;B[ch]
C[B25. Too small and slow to be interesting now. At N3 is better, and is the logical followup to B21,23.]
;W[lq]
C[W26. although this protects the W corner here, a splitting play at J3 seems preferable.]
;B[ql];W[ol]C[W28. This is fine IF White follows up correctly.];B[pj];
W[oh];B[nj];W[ml]
C[W32. Slack. Attaching at R7 is very big and makes full use of W26, and the slide to S10 is interesting. The text is essentially valueless.]
;B[rn]
C[B33. Now it it Black who makes some territory here, while stabilizing his stones.]
;W[lj]
C[W34. It's no longer of much value to enclose B because he can not only live easily, but do it with a satisfactory amount of territory. S5 is much bigger and better.]
;B[rp];W[ip]
C[W36. To make territory in the center? The lower right corner is where the action is (or should be) now! S3 is absolutely necessary!]
;B[qq]C[B37. Of course! W's loss here is immense!];W[pq];B[qo];W[pp];
B[qr];W[ic];B[kc];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[fe];W[ge];B[ff]
C[B49. Too passive! Nidan Bane at G14 is not only feasible but far  better.]
;W[fb]C[W50.  Better at G14.];B[eb]C[B51. Better at G14.];W[hm]
C[W52. L18 or even L16 now would be better. This group is not yet completely stable.]
;B[dj];W[ci];B[di];W[dk];B[fj]
C[B57. Under the circumstances, at E9 is preferable, and even B11 is feasible and very large. But the text is O.K. if B's intent is to prepare for an invasion of the W lower center.]
;W[bh];B[cg];W[bg];B[cf];W[hj];B[gf];W[he];B[ck];W[bk];B[cl];W[bl];
B[on];W[nn];B[no];W[oo];B[nm];W[mn];B[om];W[mm];B[nl]
C[B77. At this point B is far ahead in settled territory, and W's impressive looking lower center is stiil quite open to reduction.]
;W[np]
C[W78. Why? B71 isn't going anywhere. If not THE losing move, certainly A losing move. H2 at least more or less justifies W52,62, and S18 is large.]
;B[ir]C[B79.  Good, but S18 is even better.];W[iq];B[jr]
C[B81. This is fine IF Black has read out the continuation after W's almost certain H2 to follow. If he has not, then playing this stone at H2 is better and nore than good enough.  B is desperately trying for more than he needs to win!]
;W[hr]
C[W82. This should have been anticipated by B before he decided upon his last. ]
;B[hq]C[B83. Wrong! W has no good answer to the simple clamp at G2.];
W[gq];B[hp]
C[B85.  Wrong again! G2 is still good enough! White is just lucky here.]
;W[fr];B[fp];W[gp];B[ho];W[go];B[ep];W[hn];B[ns]
C[B93. Premature. First, White can only defend against this in Gote, so if he does Black gets 2 successive big plays elsewhere.  S18 is still the biggest play now, because it's the key pivot point in the corner and the upper right Black stones are still not completely settled.]
;W[nr];B[os];W[ms];B[pr];W[or];B[ps];W[mr]
C[W94-100. Dancing to B's tune!  Now B93 is fully justified, and B has Sente to play the big point at S18. ]
;B[hk]
C[B101. The wrong idea! At S18 is correct, but this move is small in any event. L15, S11, K18 are all larger.]
;W[ik]
C[W102. Continues to dance to B's tune. this was your chance to occupy the key pivot point  in the upper right corner at S18!]
;B[gk];W[ek]
C[W104. Small and badly timed. An excellent move somewhat later, but as noted above, not yet.]
;B[ij];W[jk];B[hi];W[ad];B[bd];W[ae];B[af];W[bf];B[ac];W[be];B[bc];
W[rb]C[W116. At long last!!!];B[ce]
C[B117.  Excruciatingly small and pure Gote!  Q18 is much bigger, and implies a later S19 with Sente as a big endgame play. K18 is also very big! S11 is also far larger and Sente as well.]
;W[ea];B[da];W[fa];B[cb];W[jb]
C[W122. As previously noted, this was another nice point for B to have occupied earlier.]
;B[kb];W[ka]
C[W124. Where's the hurry to play here? This is a Gote-Sente yose situation, so W will almost certainly get to play this before B can play at K19.  Instead, Q18 is big, and even S11 is better.]
;B[jc];W[ib];B[la];W[ja];B[mb]
C[B129. P18 instead "kills two birds with one stone".];W[rj];B[rk];
W[qj];B[qk];W[bo];B[bp];W[bn];B[nf]
C[B137. A monumental blunder! The lower left corner cries out for  making shape at B2! This kind of move absolutely must not be missed! The text isn't worth much in any event.]
;W[me]
C[W138. An overplay locally in any event, but B2 is begging to be played! Both players are blind to this key point.]
;B[pg]C[B139. Another local overplay.];W[og];B[ph];W[pi];B[oi];W[qi];
B[qg];W[rg];B[of];W[pf];B[nh];W[qf];B[ke];W[ng]
C[W152, 154. With what point??? All you're doing is killing the Aji of W132 while forcing B to consolidate his territory here. In this game that's trivial, but in a close game this could easily be the difference between victory and defeat.]
;B[mf];W[mg];B[lf];W[pn];B[pm];W[po];B[mk];W[lk];B[hf];W[ap]
C[W162.  Ordinarily, playing here instead of at B2 would bring Black to life when he occupies that key point, but here after B B2, W A2 kills, so Black is dead here no matter what if White can read out the fight correctly.]
;B[aq]
C[B163. But this offers Black no hope at all, and succumbs without even a fight!]
;W[bq]
C[W164. The coup de grace. The Black corner is dead and with it the game is lost.]
;B[cq];W[ar];B[br];W[aq];B[fs];W[gr];B[eo];W[dn];B[fm]
C[B173. Desperation.];W[en];B[hs]
C[B175. Since this doesn't produce an eye, it has no real point here.  But then again, its hard to see what does make sense for B.]
;W[fn];B[cs];W[es]C[W178. Now it's all over! B is dead.];B[as];W[ao];
