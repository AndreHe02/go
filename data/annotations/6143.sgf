C[*Hi, thanks for reviewing, comments for both players would be appreciated. This game was played live without clocks - we took about 2 hrs. player comments marked with *.

No problem!

Just bear in mind that while my opening is ok, its definitely the weakest part of my game]
;B[pp];W[pc]MA[pe]C[I read somewhere that Kajiwara felt this to be a losing move...

This sounds silly, but the idea of it is that white is allowing black to immediately build a framework.

As black, I would be tempted to play Q15 right away.];B[co]
;W[dd];B[cf]MA[pe]C[Q15 is still much bigger];W[qn];B[pe];W[fc]
;B[nq]CR[qk]C[this is a bit strange, black has played Q15, which would love an extension around R9, R9 also pincers R6.

O3 is just letting white build a base, which in turn makes Q15 weaker]
;W[qk]LB[qh:1]C[which white in fact does, 

However.. this move has very little effect on Q15... and since black played O3 rather than O4, I think this white should be at R12. Black would have a very hard time invading this extension, not only can white still live in the corner, but if black invades, W can run out, attack the invader and then live in the corner.]
;B[qc]LB[qg:1][pb:2][oc:3][ob:4][qd:5]C[1 seems more reasonable. anything else is just going to give black a large corner.

if black then plays 2, the sequence 3 to 5 follows black will likely end in gote, and white will be able to follow up elsewhere.

However, I think the situation would be much better if R9 were closer.]
;W[pd];B[qd];W[oe];B[od];W[pf];B[qe];W[nd];B[oc];W[nc];B[pb]
;W[nf]C[*fair exchange? w gets influence, b a 20pt corner plus sente

I think this is bad for white, his influence is nullified by the open skirt on both sides and available peeps at P13 and N15. Black gains here]
;B[dj]C[*b immediately regretted this move. wanted E14

this move isn't that bad, white's framework already has deficiencies, it shouldn't be too hard to reduce. Might as well just work on your own framework.]
;W[ef]C[*both players believe w "won the opening" at this point, but in the end lost the game by a lot without making obvious blunders. is b simply too pessimistic at this point?

I disagree, I think black has the far superior position. R9 is too close.

Black has solid territory and a nice framework.

All of white's frameworks have holes.];B[jc]MA[lc]C[*not sure about timing or location of this invasion

Timing seems okay... although I think I would play B R13 first. White is still going to have a very hard time defending that upper area, given the aji at N15 and O18. I don't think white has a good consolidating move that doesn't leave him open to reduction.

So, destroy his territory on the right side. the R9 stone will start looking very foolish.

However, if you're going to invade.
 The placement is wrong. 

Essentially, you've given yourself no option except to run out. and it doesn't use the aji of connection at O18 as well as it could

X makes more sense. threatening a two space extension and connection]
;W[lc]C[and white takes away all the aji of O18... 

Black is still leading, but he's made it harder on himself....]
;B[lb];W[mb];B[ld];W[hc]MA[je]C[black can still play lightly and run here, and H17 isn't worth that much.

I think a capping play for white makes more sense];B[me];W[ne]
;B[kc];W[ke]C[*w was proud of this move. rightfully so?

well, it pokes out some eyespace, but, after b captures at N17, he either has ko for connection or an excellent target.]
;B[mc];W[md]C[A move too early to fight the ko I think, B would be happy just playing M15.]
;B[nb];W[lc];B[ma]C[connects... which is certainly good enough.]
;W[qf]C[and white gets the huge point I talked about earlier]
;B[ok]C[its a reduction I spose... but I think the shoulder hit at Q10 makes more sense]
;W[le];B[mc]MA[om][nm][on][ol]C[White must break through at one of the marked points. Anything else and black is going to have a Thickness field day]
;W[ni];B[ql];W[pl];B[pk];W[rl];B[ol];W[qm];B[on]C[good sabaki]
;W[ep]C[black is in, what we call in the business "The Butter Zone"

he has huge thickness and E4 is just BEGGING to be pincered.]
;B[dq]C[GAHHHH!

let white have the corner... if you strengthen yourself up on both sides, this game is over.]
;W[hp]MA[eq][iq]C[ok, this isn't entirely unreasonable,  restraining black's inevitable extension, but doesn't J3 sing to you?

I do agree that E3  may be a little slow.];B[jq]C[too short now... but you do have an attack]
;W[lq]C[*now a big fight starts, do you see many missed tesuji over ensuing sequence?

Well, this move is awkward... black should just play K5 and W shouldn't be able to save the M3 stone]
;B[jo];W[lo];B[km];W[oo];B[po];W[nn];B[nm];W[pn];B[om];W[oq]
;B[pq];W[lm];B[ll];W[kn];B[jn];W[or];B[op];W[nr];B[mp];W[jm]
;B[kl];W[jp];B[ip]MA[kp]C[Black made all good moves up to here, this is wrong, 

The marked point finishes white off cleanly. After white connects, black also connects, and white cannot split at either L3 or L5.

and the cleaner the better.];W[kp];B[io];W[kq]MA[iq]C[should be at J3]
;B[no]MA[iq]C[What's this?

J3 is only move.

look at black's territory on the left!

and white STILL wouldn't be alive yet.];W[jr]C[I would generally prefer J3 here, since it makes H4 useful]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[dh]MA[gq]C[*right time to tenuki? b feels he has won the game if he plays solidly from this point.

Definitely a bad time to tenuki, W can play G3 now to spectacular effect.

It may NOT change that black is winning, but BG3 would be nice... D12 is slow, especially when you consider that black can live in the corner.]
;W[cn];B[do];W[eq];B[cl]C[B is getting passive...];W[be];B[cb]
;W[bc];B[bf];W[bb]C[*maybe this move not needed?

Its not needed, C18 has no hope of living, W should play K10 now, A reduction, a ladder breaker and a territory builder.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[fh];W[fn];B[dn];W[fq]C[yuck...G3 is so much more appealing if you're going to defend directly.]
;B[hm];W[hh]C[*should this move be closer to L10 instead? 

I still feel K10 is the best here.];B[jh];W[kh]MA[ij][lh][hf]
C[attaching to a weak stone?! shame on ye!

The Marked points are my initial thoughts here];B[ji];W[el]
C[Does this threaten something I'm not aware of?];B[kg]C[good move for black, reduce and H12 may get into danger, als M10 area starting to look like territory...]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[ck];B[dk];W[cm]MA[dm];B[dl]LB[dm:A]C[no no! if black plays at A, How does white live?

This leaves more bad aji.];W[pj];B[mg];W[mf];B[nh];W[oh];B[ib]
C[b very far ahead now.];W[ln];B[hg];W[gm];B[dm];W[im]C[*a misread .. is w out of chances for a comeback from now on?

white has been out of chances for a little while... Black just has too much cash...]

;B[il];W[rq]C[*h18 bigger?

I'd say this is much bigger. but its a testament to how few points w has that F19 looks so fearsome...]
;B[fa]LB[ha:1][hb:2][gb:3][ga:4][ea:5][ia:6][fb:7]C[W should play the sequence from 1 to 7]
;W[ga]C[wrong response, H19 is more reasonable.];B[gb];W[fb]

;W[mr]C[*w didn't want ko fight

Ko fight? this is correct. N3 would be unnecessary for a (very small) chance at 1 more point.]
;B[re]SQ[rf]C[marked point is better, has HUGE followups];W[rf]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[gc];W[fj];B[rr];W[qr];B[qs];W[qo];B[hd];W[he]
;B[ie];W[ee];B[ng];W[og];B[sq]C[*a misread due to overconfidence, we finished to yose for practice, but stopped recording moves after this sequence]
;W[sp];B[rp];W[sr];B[qp];W[rs]SQ[ro]C[correct move is the marked one here now, this  is worth about 8 points.]
;B[ps];W[ro]C[Interesting game, Black took an early lead and held it, White lost an opportunity by trying to fight the ko in his upper side, he needed to run black out and take profit by attacking.

The "joseki" in the upper right was a definite gain for black. 

On the lower side, black could have kept w out of the F5 area entirely by just letting white live..

Cheers!
