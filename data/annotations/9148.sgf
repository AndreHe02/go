AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hi,
I played Black in a 3-stone game in which I beat an opponent who usually beats me, but I think the game was fairly close until I made one particularly large yose move.

I would appreciate comments on where I played in the wrong direction, or missed an urgent or big move, or made a notworthy tactical blunder.  I have included a number of questions at points where I wonder if I could have played better, but of course I will be glad to see whatever you find noteworthy, as far as your energy permits.

Thank you!]PL[W];W[po];B[pq]C[I don't know these 5-4 josekis, but by a miracle (and by trying to be sensible) I found the joseki moves!
(After the game he showed me some variations I never could have played properly...)]

Better at big points like B or C?

This is one of the basic joseki, P6/Q6 exchange is good for black, that lone stone might be useful as ladder breaker :)

R13 is good move.];W[fc];B[df]LB[ic:a]C[Should I have pincered around A to extend from upper right shimari?

Yes, pincer would be more interesting.];W[ch];B[ic]TR[pd][qg]
C[For the next  10   moves or so, not sure I responded properly to his double pincer on my stones.

For instance, have I counter pincered from the right direction?

J17 is good move, consider the shimari at top right as there is potential to develop the top side.]

Let's do a inventory check :)

Black:

White:
Top left 15
Top right 5

Black ahead by about 15 pts.]

usually futile to try for such, since he can easily jump in.
