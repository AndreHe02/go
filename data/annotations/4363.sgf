C[Dear reviewer,

This was a game between me and a slightly stronger opponent that I managed to win despite numerous misreads. The game was quite even throughout and no 'winning moves' were made. Please find some comments inlined.

Thank You

Javi:

Hi,

I am only a little stronger than you so dont take my advice as the absolute truth but I will try to help you.

I will put "javi" before my comments and I will put as many variations as i could to show other good moves.]

(;B[ck]C[I had some doubts about this, but I wanted to both avoid white pincer and establish a base immediately so decided to play here. C10 or D9 seemed too thin.

javi: As you say, c9 is a little restricted but it is played quite often. Any other move is subject to an inmediate invasion. The most usual response is D10. Look at variation.]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[pn];W[kp]C[javi: This is a joseki. Look at variation.]

(;B[mp];W[np];B[mo];W[mn];B[ln];W[mq];B[lp]C[javi: this way black gets a heavy shape while white can get live quite easily.]

(;B[pl]C[javi: Q8 is quite big but forcing first at n7 is important. Look at the variation]
;W[lm];B[ip];W[kn];B[kq];W[ko];B[eq]C[Here I should probably have played K4 or the like. I wanted to prevent white from settling the corner and thought I can defend K3 by playing K2.

javi: You have a lot of options here.

You have not to worry too much about white corner because it is open at C3.

E3 is a good option to get either the corner or the side.];W[jq]
C[javi: White tries attack directly.]
(;B[jr];W[iq];B[ir];W[hq];B[hr];W[gq];B[gr];W[fq]C[As it turns out white not only settled the corner but also developed good wall in the meantime. K4 instead of E3 would have prevented this I think.

javi: true. When you leave a fight as it is, you always have to be sure that your opponent can not  get an advantage.]
;B[cq];W[fr];B[mr];W[nr];B[lr];W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[Should have played Q3 first? I was afraid white might play R4, live in the corner and consume all my potential territory so I decided to save what was left of it and play here.]
;W[pq];B[ce]C[javi: C15 is a very good move but black has all his stones at the left side in the third line so it is very low.]
;W[dg];B[ee];W[fc];B[ch]C[Wanted to prevent white from establishing a base on the left and make him run. Worked to some extent, since I was able to get big territory on the left side. The drawback is that white gets big area in the middle.]
;W[cg];B[dh];W[eg];B[ff];W[eh];B[ei];W[gh];B[gg];W[fi];B[ej]
;W[fj];B[ek];W[fk];B[eo];W[fo];B[ep];W[el];B[dl];W[fm]C[javi: This is a position is which black should count before he chooses an option. If he has enough points he should play at upper right corner and let white try to enclose the center which is quite difficult usually. If white could make so many points that he is ahead, black should invade but the he is prone to be attacked so he will lose the iniciative and his right side territory would be reduced greatly.]
;B[jj]C[Too early? Wrong place? White had a big territory here so I wanted to reduce it. If white would have played in this area first, it would have been difficult to reduce later. Don't know if it would have mattered so much in points though. Perhaps something like R11 or P16 would have been bigger.]
;W[ik]C[javi: If your opponent anwers you then it is, at least, a forcing move.]
;B[fg];W[fh];B[hd];W[hb];B[jc];W[nd]C[javi: I think that black has enough strengh at top to answer white at right side around q14 making a big right side. Another option is to slide at left side corner at b17 reducing white while attacking.]
;B[mc];W[qf];B[pe]C[Try to separate the two white stones.];W[oc]
;B[pf]C[Should have played Q17? Now I let the white to get corner and life quite easily.

Javi: You have two options here:

1- secure the corner with q17 while attacking white at top. It is a good plan but white probably will extend at r11 and then right side territory almost disappear

2- play at the right side making it big even if white take the corner. This was your choice and I think it is better than taking the corner.]
;W[qc];B[qg];W[md];B[lc];W[qj]C[javi: this invasion is quite risky but if black secures the whole right side the game is ended.]

;W[rj];B[ph];W[oi];B[rc];W[qb];B[bc]C[Here I wanted to put pressure on the white group and possibly kill it. Did not work so well.

javi: b17 is an excellent point. But killing white is hoping for too much.]

;W[ld];B[ke];W[kd];B[je];W[mi];B[li];W[mj];B[lh]C[javi: this result is very, very good for black. You were worried about white taking all the center and you has made a very big territory there. The game is almost won by black.]

;W[fa];B[ea]C[Misread. B18 perhaps? No kill, but better move anyway.

Javi: yes, with b18 you take points WHILE attacking that is almost always good. First reduce from the outside then go for the "heart" of the group.]

You have showed a good sense for territory and iniciative, have not made any significative mistake even sacrificed small stones to close the center. I think your play is quite balanced and good. You may improve a little more at attacking weak groups or at josekis. Anyway I am only a little stronger than you, so dont take all my advice as the "only" truth.
