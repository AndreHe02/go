C[Hi!
I would appreciate that you give me some advice in this game. I think I've lost in the fuseki, so I 'm especially interested in that part.
Thanks,

Hello ^^

Let's see if I can be of only help :) hmm, please note that english isn't my native language so please bear with all the grammatical/vocabulary errors ^^

Exil];B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp];B[de]LB[eq:A]C[A move at A is more common as it's the only kakari which can aim at developping black own stones (with a strategy close to the one of the Chinese opening, trying to make a moyo at the bottom while attacking any kakari on Q3)]
;W[ce]LB[dq:A]C[This is a good answer, it puts the emphasis on the fact that black can't aim at making a moyo in your own sphere of influence, so you just "take the points" and tell black "Now, what are you going to do ?"

A pincer would be innapropriate as it wouldn't be facing C4 (if C4 was at A, it'd be very different) ... as a side note, you chosed a "not so easy" opening, komokus are slow by nature, and when you are white, it's usual to try to gain speed in order to get sente as quickly as possible in the opening. The basic theory of Go says that for every disymetric stone, adding a second move (kakari/shimari) has almost as much value as the first move, thus, you aren't gaining that much of an advantage in the corner (as opposed with the hoshi or the san san). You just set a territorial strategy for white. But at any rate, this is of course more than common ^^ Just be careful not to fall behind in the opening.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[dg]C[This move has a slow feeling. A common idea is to tenuki and play at E3 instead, but this is still playable for black (I know you are white, but it's important to see black's plan/idea/mistake in order to get a better feeling for this opening ^^)]
;W[fc];B[ep]C[Black plays well, I was afraid he'd finish the joseki :)]

(;W[dn]C[Here I was not sure where to answer

Yes, it's a difficult situation. Locally speaking, your move is certainly the best. You can't make a pincer as you aren't strong in the area and a territorialy-hungry move like E3 would put you kinda behind in influence, so this move makes the best balance as well as aiming on "punishing" black on his tenuki at the top. However, here, I'd consider tenuki as a first option since it's clear that D6 isn't that amazing : this move is aiming at building influence, making a moyo on the left side, and black is already here with a nice shape to prevent you from making your points. Yet, if you don't add a move, at worse, you'll get your points and black will get  more influence, that's true, but not in a very interesting direction as Q3 is facing Q16, not E4. All those considerations lead me to think that tenuki is a good choice here, and as for where to play, Q5 looks the more natural.]
;B[ck]C[C9 is more common at C8 (vital point of the shape)...It doesn't feel like white is in any danger, so maybe, once again, tenuki ?

You can also try to take advantage of black missing the vital point by attacking  E4.]
;W[hp]C[You chose the attacking version ^^

I'm not so sure it's that good as there is actually bigger point on the board, such as Q5. 

If I had to add a move here, I'd play something unusual like D4, to take points while making black heavy. I know that D4 isn't joseki, but it's kind of hard to make a good use of your stones here as they are perpendicular, and thus, not working that well together, so your first target should be making points (and so, D4 isn't that stupid, even if it's not the best move), instead of making a moyo with D6 or attacking, like with H4...]
;B[cq]C[Usually, the tesuji is at C5, but black needs C8, or else, it doesn't work (I'll let you work out the variations by yourself ;p)

Black doesn't look so good here...];W[bq];B[dq];W[bo];B[gp]
;W[go]C[I thought a lot before answering G5, but I didn't find a good move, as an extension would have left my H4 stone very weak. I feared a pincer as I played G5, and I felt very lucky black didn't do it]
;B[gq]
(;W[hq]C[The cutting point at H5 is kinda annoying];B[fo];W[lp]
LB[cf:A][bo:C][ep:B][hp:D]C[It looks like you felt that connecting at H5 was too slow..it's indeed slow, right now the cut won't do any good for black as you are strong on both side yet, there is the feeling that M4 is more trying to save yourself by making a base than anything else, you are also inviting black to make a shimari at Q5, which is never such a good thing (unless black already has a stone around Q9 for exemple)

Here, if we look at the whole board, A and B are both thick, even if B has a a kinda bad shape...However, the C group isn't doing much more than living and D is going to give you troubles later, since even an easy move like M2 is threatening your base of life...This isn't an expected result with your opening, and I guess that the "mistake" here is D6, then H4, and the finally H3...those three moves are "okay", but they don't lead to a balanced opening because you need to play first at Q5. Once again, black managed to attack your two corner and get out with sente to play his own shimari ! As a matter of fact, it's almost like if you are giving H2 to black :p (This is, of course, an exageration, but not so much ^^)]
;B[gn]C[This move has an aji keshi feeling...It doesn't do anything but making black gote (and white thicker)..what went through his mind ? No one will ever know.]
;W[ho];B[em]C[oh oh, trying to attack the living group ? :p]
;W[br]C[I played B2 to avoid future problems, but it was gote so I don't know if it was necessary
I feel Black have the best out of this fight in the end, as he has built a big moyo

B2, or better C2 are gote, but are big in themselves and prevent black from squeezing you even more. This is another painful result of D6, but when something has started, it's better to end it cleanly that getting crazy all over the board, so I can't say that it's bad.

However, you shouldn't be concerned so much with black moyo. The thing that should concern you is Q5 !]

(;B[dm]C[Strange move...];W[po]C[Yes, Q5 is the only move now. I'd also consider G14, as I showed earlier, they are kind of miai. Yet, now, you have sente, so it's better to try to save the game than getting greedy over a "little" moyo :p]
;B[nq];W[qq];B[qp]C[Quite unusual...];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr]
(;B[op]
(;W[qo];B[rp];W[ro];B[rr];W[qk]C[This is okay but now black gained a nice move at P6, and you just got a ko threat at Q2 in exchange...this looks unfair for white.]
;B[qi]
(;W[qf]C[This pincer didn't seem satisfying to me, but I felt R17 or O 16 were worse

R14 is clearly a strange move...]
(;B[pk];W[pl];B[pj];W[nc]C[Looks like you come back to O17 in the end :p Still, your R5 is getting thinner...]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[me]C[This move is seldom played.]
(;W[od];B[ne]
(;W[pe]C[My answer in this corner was a disaster. Here I wanted to cut him but the cut was worse for me.

Well,  one more stone and you'd win at Go Narabe :p It's true that this fight doesn't look so good.]
;B[oc];W[oe];B[pc];W[mc];B[rd]C[The N15 cutting stones are too much for white to handle...looks like this game is going to end soon :(]
;W[ng];B[le];W[jc];B[jd]
(;W[ic]C[Maybe this was too passive

Any other move would help black to build his wall to attack your other group, so this is just fine. I'd even play more passively, with a move at L17, but this may be worse than better :)]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[pg];W[of]

[or][qr][sr][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Well, that wasn't such a bad game, you tried hard to come back, but I guess that it wasn't possible...black missed many chances to attack you more severly, but It's always much easier to taunt someone when you have a better position :P As you said, the main thing in this game is the fuseki, a semi-failure for white...This is really not an easy opening, I never play it actually, I think that being white is already hard enough, no need to add much pressure :p But I guess this is my style, which is more based on influence than actual territory. If you keep practicing it, you'll get a better feeling for it and the tenukis will appear natural. Always keep in mind that a kakari on a komoku is almost never absolute sente ! It's a stone very different from the hoshi, it's more than just a difference in joseki or in goals, it's a very flexible stone, and both the komoku or the kakari can bear a lot of tenukis (unlike with the Hoshis, where tenukis are seldoms)

Well, I hope I was clear enough ^^ See you someday :p If you ever go on KGS, my nickname is Exil (same on cyberoro)
