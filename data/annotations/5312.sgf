C[Hi, thank you for reviewing my game, recently i have be getting to 4k (kgs) and dropping back down to 5k, but i think that may be a psychological thing. In this game i think there are many overplays and i would like answers on how to respond to them. also i could use all the help you can give me with my fighting

reid: Well, let's see what I can do to help you look at the game with different eyes, and perhaps that will get you through the barrier.]
;B[pp]C[kilroy [4k\]: hi];W[dd]C[fredley [5k\]: hi];B[pd];W[dq]
;B[dj]C[here i didn't respond because i felt like i couldn't put enough pressure on the single black stone]
;W[nc]C[reid: there is nothing wrong with O17.  At this point, there are a lot of different ways to play, and o17 is certainly one reasonable way.]
;B[pf];W[cn]LB[cl:B][co:A]C[then i regret my choice and tenuki from the top right

reid: It is also quite reasonable to not continue in the upper right corner and return to the left side.  But if you are regretting O17, that could be an indication that you don't have enough confidence in your moves.  There is no reason to regret O17.

On the other hand, C6 is a slight problem.  I say that because it too indicates some lack of confidence.  Here's how it goes:

You can either keep the corner with A, or you can attack D10 with B.  But trying to do a little bit of both ends up doing neither very well.  The large knight's move is pretty weak at keeping the corner and you will need to play here again when D10 gets stronger.  So if you want the corner, better to take it with one move (A) instead of C6 now plus another move later.

Attacking directly and strongly with B is also a reasonable way to play.  But you must play it knowing that it doesn't take the lower left corner (at least, not yet, and not all by itself).]
;B[cf]C[reid: natural response for black.];W[fd]C[reid: also natural for white.]
;B[bd]C[reid: But this is a problem for black.

It's very important to understand certain aspects of the 4-4 openings.  The variation describes some of those aspects.  It is so important that I suggest you study it now, and again a month from now, and once more in two months.  In between, you should have opportunities to practise these concepts in your games because they happen a lot.  At the end of these three months you should have a very good grasp these shapes, and also the meaning behind them.  You can then apply the ideas to lots of other shapes.]

(;W[jd]LB[cc:A][kd:B]C[reid: if you followed the variation from the previous move, you can see why white should play at A (C17) instead of K16.

As a secondary point: here white has decided to split the distance between F16 and O17 with K16.  But the proverb says "play away from strength" which can be turned around to "play closer to weakness".  If we ask "which is weaker: F16 or O17?", it's pretty obvious that two stones are stronger than one, so O17 is weaker.  K16 would be better at B (L16).

But of course, K16 really needs to be at C17 in the first place.  But you will certainly have opportunites in the future to make this kind of extension where there is not an over-riding reason to play elsewhere.  Then you must remember to play closer to the weaker stone(s), and resist the temptation to play right in the middle.]
;B[cc]C[reid: black takes the key point, white has missed his chance.]
;W[eg];B[dh]LB[dc:A][ch:B]C[reid: The exchange of E13 for black D12 does far more for black than for white.  White takes a tiny bit of outside thickness, but he forces black to fix his weakness between C14 and D10 while taking a significant number of points. 

If you want to win, you really should avoid giving your opponent a helping hand.  Even if he's your friend, you should help him with tough-love: show him the error of his ways and beat the pants off him instead of just handing him points :-)

Better for white is to simply block at A and hope to make something of the aji around B later. 

Okay, we're just 15 moves into the game, but already we've discussed a lot of stuff.  It's very important to understand just how sensitive the opening moves are.  You are laying the foundations for the following two to three hundred moves.  If you want to get stronger, it's worth taking a some care with your opening moves.]
;W[dc];B[cl]C[reid: this is a good move for black.  It eliminates any aji in his shape and prepares to launch a possible invasion into white's lower left corner (remember I mentioned that C6 doesn't hold the corner very securely?)

It may seem slow for black, but since white has already made several mistakes, black can afford to be cautious.]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[qq];B[qp]LB[pi:C][pj:B][pk:A][pn:F][no:E][kp:H]
[jq:G][pq:D]C[reid: this is the wrong direction for black.  This is not playable unless black has an extension around A or B (even C is really too far for black to block on this side).

Instead, black should follow the joseki that proceeds from blocking at D.  He will end up with a strong group on the lower side, and an invasion into the white lower-left corner should be easy.

For white's part, since black D doesn't do anything to help his game, he should try something other than the jump to 3-3.  Jumping to E followed by black F then attacking with white G might be a way to stir up trouble and get back in the game.

Note that the joseki with white H instead of G gives black territory and white thickness which won't be useful in this game because of the black presence at D10 and Q14.  Sticking to joseki is not a good way to get stronger.  Understanding which joseki to use in different situations is far more important.

However, if you know in advance that black is going to play at R4, then white R3 is a good choice.  But counting on your opponent to help you out is not a good way to get stronger.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mp]C[is this a good enough finish? also the common move is N5 is that becuase of the possible cut at N5 here?

reid: This result is now bad for black for two reasons.  We already discussed that black doesn't have the extension around A, so the direction of R4 is wrong.  But now black has deviated from joseki to try to get more than his fair share.]
;W[qk]C[reid: this is a reasonable way to punish black's direction mistake.  His joseki mistake is still waiting.]
;B[oq]C[reid: aji-keshi for black.  It doesn't do anything to help black - in fact he takes away one of his own liberties.  When white answers, the exchange is better for white than for black.]
;W[or];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[np]LB[qh:B][sr:A]C[reid: better to simply make the white group safe with A.  Black still owes a move to fix this weakness.  If he pays that debt now, his 9 stones (O4, etc) can't possibly take enough territory to eompensate for losing the corner, and white gets sente to play B first (attacking black while defending his weak stone).

If white plays A, it's probably pretty close to an even game again.  Black has more territory, but he also has some problems that he will have trouble fixing.]
;B[no];W[mo];B[nn]C[reid: Normally, push and cut would be a no-brainer.  But here white's Q3 stones aren't quit alive yet.

Basic principle: you cannot attack if you are not strong.  White needs to be patient enough to fix his Q3 stones before launching this attack.  He doesn't need to rush this attack because white R9 already destroys the black influence from his wall.]
;W[kq]LB[lo:A]C[reid: this is a strange move for white.

If white is going to push and cut, he needs to follow through with A to continue the attack.  But it is hard to see how this attack will progress.  The Q3 group is a liability because it's not alive yet.

Black has too many good ways to continuefrom this move.];B[kp]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[mq];B[lp];W[qh]LB[jq:A]C[reid: in order to salvage anything from this fight, white *must* pull out his L3 stone with A.  Once black takes L3, his group is almost alive already.  White needs that bottom side territory to stay in the game.

By comparison, the white stone at R9 has a lot of room to move.  Black can attack it, but he can't kill it.

This situation exemplifies the proverb: play the urgent move, not the big move.  White A (K3) is absolutely urgent.]
;B[jq]C[reid: now whte has almost nothing to show for the last 15 moves or so.  The stone at N5 cuts, but since the groups on both sides can live easily, it is not useful.

Black has lots of territory in the top left, and he is ahead in the balance of thickness, so he should be able to coast to an easy win.]
;W[en];B[sr];W[rs]C[misread

reid: Indeed.  But even if white lived here, he is just giving away points - black T2 is absolute sente.

If white had played at T2 earlier, his group would be safe, and black would have no aji here.]
;B[pr]C[reid: ouch.];W[qr];B[ps];W[ls]C[reid: another mis-read.  White N1 gets a ko.  This way white is just dead.

My teacher always asks this question: how many ways?  Meaning, how many moves does black have that kill white?  Try to find them all before looking at the variation.

The importance of finding all the different ways is that there is almost always a 'best' way.  Too often we settle for the first way we can find, which probably won't be the best way.]

(;B[ks];W[nh]C[is there a better way to attack this black group?

reid: white cannot attack this black group.  With one move, black can take the corner for easy life.  If white takes away the corner, black has lots of room to run into the center.

As it turns out, black gives white *two* moves agains this corner, and they still can't be killed.

White can only choose which way to make black live.  But since the white stones in the lower right corner are dead, black is far, far ahead.]
;B[ns]LB[pb:A]C[here i fell behind, i must try something

reid: Actually, black just fell behind.  The white stones are already dead - why does black want to play another move?

Black A to take the corner locks the game up tight for black.]
;W[pb];B[me]LB[qb:A][nd:C][ng:D][ph:B]C[reid: Well, for some reason black wanted to give white a helping hand in this corner, so he passed his previous move.  Now that white has two moves against this corner, black probably needs to do something.

Let's talk a bit about fighting technique.  Here we have two black stones facing off against four and 1/2 to five white stones.  Clearly black is outnumbered - he is at a severe disadvantage in this fight.  What should he do?

The way to fight against overwhelming odds is usually to make contact moves.  Normally, contact moves help your opponent get stronger.  I like to say "You touch me, you help me".  But here black doesn't mind making white stronger.  He just wants to make his stones live.  He's far enough ahead in other parts of the board that he can afford to let white get stronger here.

So for contact moves, there are three that come to mind without too much thinking: A, B, and C.  A bit more thinking might produce D

The idea behind all of these is that black is ready to sacrifice something in order to get some eye shape, or perhaps to escape into the center.  As long as black remains flexible and keeps his eye on the goal, he should have to trouble getting life for these stones.]
;W[kg]LB[ld:A]C[reid: White L13 may feel like it's surrounding black, but white is too thin.  Instead, he should answer at A and thank black for helping him build territory.

You would like your moves to be useful in the future as well as now.  L13 has no future towards the center of the board because black is very strong at D10 and O6.  White cannot hope to make a moyo in the center, so L13 has only one meaning.]
;B[lc]C[reid: black makes a strong attack.  Now white is likely to lose his only big territory (the top side).]
;W[jc]C[reid: white defends his territory, but now the O17/Q18 stones are relatively weaker, so black is satisfied.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[ke];W[je];B[lg];W[lh];B[kf];W[jg];B[jf];W[if]
;B[mg];W[ne]C[reid: white tries to attack, but black is pretty strong here now.]
;B[nf];W[oe];B[of];W[qe];B[mh];W[mi];B[pe];W[rc]C[reid: white gets the vital point for attack and defense.  Black could have taken this point earlier.  White would have to defend by connecting at M18.  Black could then get stronger as he presses white down to the second line.]
;B[qf]LB[pc:C][qd:B][rd:A][re:D]C[reid: Black does not use his strong stones effectively with this move.  Perhaps he should think about A instead.  If white ataries at B, black can either pull back with C or counter-atari with D (similar to the joseki that goes this way).]
;W[rd];B[ig]LB[nd:A]C[reid: black might be better off simply making two eyes with A and letting white worry about all those cutting points.]
;W[ki];B[ni];W[oh];B[oc];W[md];B[nd]LB[ld:A]C[reid: black should connect at A.  White still cannot save his two stones with O16 because of black O18.]
;W[le];B[mf];W[ld];B[lf]LB[mc:A]C[reid: black should be concentrating on getting a second eye.  Instead, he's saving stones that probably aren't worth much.  Black should play A instead of connecting.]
;W[mc]C[reid: oops! all of a sudden, black is surrounded and mono-eyed.  White may be able to arise from the dead!]
;B[kd];W[lb];B[kc];W[kb];B[ob];W[mb];B[mj];W[li];B[hf];W[ie]
;B[he];W[hd];B[gd];W[gc];B[ge];W[hc];B[rf];W[rg]C[i think this should be S15

reid: Well, white's only chance now is to kill the black group.  White S15 lets black get a second eye with S12.  Unfortunately, it looks like black S15 can kill the whie corner.  It also looks like black has more liberties than the white corner, so it's not looking good for white.]
;B[ji]C[reid: but black is off on some other chase.];W[kj]C[reid: ugly shape for white.]
;B[ih];W[kh];B[kk]C[reid: the 'nose' tesuji.  But does it work?]
;W[lk];B[nk];W[jk]LB[jj:A]C[reid: The atari is so tempting in a situation like this.  But it is usually better to simply pull out with A.  That way you don't help black get stronger.]
;B[kl];W[ij]C[boo misreading

reid: Uh, yah.];B[jj];W[lj];B[ll];W[mk];B[nj];W[ml];B[nl];W[mm]
;B[nm];W[lm];B[km];W[kn];B[il];W[jn];B[ik];W[ln];B[ri];W[qi]
;B[rh];W[qg];B[rj];W[rk]LB[sg:B][qj:A][hn:C]C[reid: fatal mistake for white!  White must connect at A.  If next black B, white S9 still prevents black's second eye.  Of course, black can still kill the white corner with S15, but white has to hope that black hasn't seen that.  Also, black C would be pretty hard for white even if he can make his corner and R11 stones all live.]
;B[qj];W[pj];B[pi];W[oi];B[pk];W[oj];B[sg]C[reid: now the black Q16 stones cannot be killed.  White can safely resign now.  If all of white's stones live, he has about 40 points.  Black has at least 70 points already, with lots of potential for more.]
;W[sh];B[si];W[hg];B[gg]LB[hh:A][hn:B]C[reid: black missed a chance here.  The G15 stones are small and not strategically valuable.  But J12/K11 are cutting off the large M11 group.  Black should atari on the other side (A), then attack at B.]
;W[ii];B[jl];W[hh];B[gh];W[hi]LB[jh:A]C[reid: white needs to take at A anyway, so he should simply take now and save a move.]

fredley [5k\]: thx

thank you for your help, is there anything you would recomend for me to practice? what is my weakness, atleast from what you can tell here

reid: This game was over on move 51 when the lower right white group died.  Black let white back into the game by making a completely wasted move.  But it could have been over again at 91 if black had been prepared to sacrifice three stones for the safety of his upper right group.  It was finally over at move 151 when the upper right black group became un-killable.  If the game is over early, there is no shame in resigning.  Better to try again with a fresh start than to fight a long and losing battle.

You already pointed out some mis-readings you made, and I pointed out a few more.  Of course, the ultimate basis for strength in go is your reading ability.  Practise life-and-death problems to help with that.  But also, be careful not to tenuki too soon.  We learn at about 8kyu that we don't have to follow our opponent around, so we start not answering his threats.  You'll need to spend from now up to perhaps 3dan learning that you really do need to answer a lot of his moves.  Don't walk away from a fight until it's really over!

It also helps if you start from a strong foundation.  I hope the discussions on the earlier parts of the game (the first 30 moves or so) will help you find the patience to build stronger opening positions.  Go is a long and protracted game.  If you rush too fast, you may find yourself ahead for a while, but falling behind at the end.  Sometimes, you just need to slow down and make that defensive move.

And finally, pay attention to the proverbs.  Perhaps the two most important ones are "play away from strength', and 'play the urgent move, not the big move'.  Both of those came up in this game, as they do in most games.

Good luck, play strong - reid])

Now, which is best?  I would probably use L1 (the move black chose) because it affects the outside - it elminates white's sente at A and B.]
)))
(;AE[dj]LB[cc:A][cg:C][ch:B]C[When black has no extension, C14 is a common approach move to the 4-4 stone.  White's extension to F16 or F17 is also common.  The difference between F16 and F17 is that F16 attacks the C14 approach move a bit more, while F17 holds the corner a bit more firmly.

Black sliding to B16 is also a common joseki, which white answers at A.  White can also pincer with B, attach at C for a Korean fighting joseki, or white can tenuki.  We won't go into those options here, we just need to understand the implications of the B16-C17 exchange.]
;W[cc]C[If white blocks the corner,];B[ci]LB[dh:A][di:B][cj:C]
[dj:D]C[black extends to C11 or he can sometimes play at A (closer but higher).

Note that B, C, and D are not joseki moves.

The key point here is that if the black B16 white C17 exchange has not been played, B, C, and D are now reasonable continuations.  C11 is also still reasonable, but A is too close.

How can that one exchange (B16 for C17) make the difference?  It's because black still has the option to invade at the 3-3 point!

See the next diagram for a better picture.];AB[dj]AE[cc][ci]
LB[ch:A]C[In the game, black has this shape.  Black is pretty thin around A.  White can invade in there and probably split black.  But splitting black won't do a bit of good if he can simply live in the corner with C17.  C17 is a huge exchange of territory, and makes black very safe as well, so the D10 stone can fight as a single group (white can't get a splitting attack).

But if white answers in the corner:];W[cc]LB[ch:A][ci:C][di:B]
C[Now black can't live in the corner, so an attack at A would be severe.  If black has B instead of D10, A is still a vital point of attack.

Again, the key is that the corner 3-3 point is blocked.  Black needs to defend against A, but there is no good point to do so efficiently.  Black really needs D10 (or B) to be at C.  Black needs to play a second move where one stone should have been sufficient.]
;AE[cc][bd]LB[cc:B][ch:A]C[Once more, from a sligthly different perspective: in this shape, if white invades at A, black has B as a safety net, and he can sacrifice C14 if necessary.]
;B[bd]C[Black B16 is a mistake when black already has D10 in place because:]
;AW[cc]LB[ch:A]C[White C17 is enough to make black's shape bad.  Now white A is severe, black C14/B16 are heavy, and black has no good way to fix his shape.

Once you absorb these concepts behind the simple D16/C14/B16 joseki, it is very easy to understand what to do in many 4-4 situations.]
