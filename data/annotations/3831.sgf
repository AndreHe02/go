C[hi!
Nice to see you!
I just played the game and feel it is a special one.
I hope i can learn something from your comments.
Thanks;)


JL = Jarkko Lindblad, Finnish 1kyu, IGS 2d*

JL: I hope my comments will be helpful.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[ce];W[cd]LB[ci:A]C[JL: white's move helps black to settle his group easily. Must better would be a hasami (pincer) as it would co-operate with the corner hoshi-stone. I would play 'A' most of the time instead as I like the distant hasami.]
;B[de];W[fd]C[JL: the problem with this move is that it leaves quite a bit of aji for black to take advantage of.]
;B[ed]LB[ci:A][ec:B][hc:C]C[maybe the hand is okay in this condition

JL: no, this move is very bad. It is aji-keshi, allowing white to remove all the potential from the local position. Instead you should have played 'A' or something similar to settle your group nicely. Later in the game you could aim at playing for example at 'B' or 'C'.

JL: you can also ask youself a question: " can white do anything here if I don't play this move?" - if the answer is no then a direct move like this is not necessary, and all unnecessary moves are bad.]
;W[ec];B[fe]LB[ef:A]C[JL: another problem with the last two of your moves is that if/when white peeps at 'A', you'll have a bad shape.]
;W[gd]C[JL: white is good now - crawling the winning line (4th line) while black has a rather bad shape.]
;B[be]C[JL: too slow and small. better to extend on the side. White should make a hasami.]
;W[bd]LB[ef:A][cm:B][dj:C]C[JL: white co-operates with black - this is also too slow and small. white should have peeped at 'A' and after black connects, play a move somewhere around 'B' or 'C'. I have no idea what is the right spot, but due to black's shape problem, the right move is probably closer to 'C' than 'B'.]
;B[di]LB[dn:A][ef:B]C[I just make sure i can live at least.
maybe A is much better and larger.

JL: Because of the peep of 'B' this is certainly better and seems like a good move. 'A' would be inferior to the normal keima kakari - the high approach should be avoided (when approaching a hoshi, 4-4, stone) unless there is a realy good reason to play it as it is harder to escape to the corner with the stone if needed.]
;W[nc];B[kd];W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ge]LB[kb:A][ng:B][kf:C]
C[JL: this is an overplay - white should play 'A', which is joseki, 'B' or 'C',  The three white stones are still weak.]

(;B[ff]LB[md:A]C[JL: this is wrong direction. There is nothing for black to be afraid of the atari or any other white move here. Instead black should probably play 'A' (see variation)]
;W[gf]C[JL: white is trying to trick black.];B[kf]LB[md:A][kg:B]
C[black is hard to run out

JL: the variation shown earlier is better ('A' etc.), This is maybe a 60% move; not really a bad one, but too easy on white. If you still want to jump to the center, I probably would have playd one space further down at 'B' as it's faster.]
;W[ng]MA[kd][kf]LB[kb:A]C[JL: i would have just made myself eyes with 'A' - it is hard to attack the two marked black stones.]
;B[hc]LB[pg:C][if:B][lc:A][kh:D][ph:E]C[exchange A for B or otherwise
But white can block at C and
white is hard to bear

JL: this move I don't like at all. A simple jump of 'D' is much better. Also you can play 'E' - the marked white stones are so thin that it is hard to attack black well, espcially since black is solid elsewhere. I would have played at 'E'.]
;W[id]LB[kb:A]C[JL: i don't like this move at all. The continuations seem to help black more than white. Better alternative is 'A' settling the white group while taking eye space from black.]
;B[ic];W[jd];B[jc];W[kc];B[lc];W[ke];B[ld];W[le]
(;B[hd]LB[ph:A][qn:B][cn:C][me:D]C[JL: this is a bad move. The strongest move is 'D' (see variation), but if you can't read the continueations, you might want to play simply and play a big move instead ('A' to 'C') and leave the top as it is - the black group is alive already.]
;W[he]LB[me:A][od:B]C[JL: ugly and unimportant. Should instead protect the cut of 'A', maybe with 'B' or some such move.]
;B[me]C[JL: Good!];W[lf];B[mf];W[lg]
(;B[nd]C[JL: i don't know if this move or the vatiation is better. This probably is, but it is also more complicated. White's position is really bad.]
;W[od];B[md]
(;W[pc]LB[pg:A]C[JL: overplay i think, but then again, white's situation locally is horrible. Maybe it would be best for him to leave these stones here as aji and play 'A' or something like that instead and hope to make a position on the side.]

(;B[oe]C[JL: see the variation for a stronger move. You let white live in the corner for no reason.]
;W[qd];B[oc]C[black can be satisfied

JL: not really - he let white off the hook as white can now easily live in the corner.]
;W[rc];B[mg]C[JL: this is pretty much sente.];W[qe]LB[lh:A]
C[JL: white should have played 'A' to gain liberties.]
(;B[pe]LB[lh:A][qf:B][ob:C]C[JL: a useless move. It does not really do much. Instead you should first hane at 'A' as white pretty much has to answer. After that you should block at 'B'. White only has small moves in the corner, and they all are gote, white black has the sente move of 'C' left if white doesn't play a move in the corner.]
;W[ob];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[re];B[pj]LB[qn:A][qo:B]C[JL: too close to your own thickness. 'A' or 'B'  better.]
;W[po]MA[pj]C[JL: now it is clear that the marked stone is too far up as it has no effect on the stone white played.]
;B[pm]MA[rg][qf][pf][pe][pd][oe][mg][mf][me][nd][md][ld]C[the pincer hand is rare

JL: this is very severe on white. However it sure looks like you let white too easy cause of the earlier moves. You are so thick with the marked stones that it is a pity that you played the last two moves so close to it - instead you should have tried to drive the opponent towards it.]
;W[no];B[mq]LB[nq:A]C[JL: probably better to play ikken-tobi of 'A' instead as you give white now more moves to settle his group.]
;W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[pp];B[qq]LB[sg:A]C[JL: white can be happy he got an easy life here white black gained quite little. The black side is smaller than it seems.cause of for example 'A'.]
;W[qp]LB[mp:A]C[JL: seems slow. white should have played 'A' first and then leave the position.]
;B[rq]LB[qn:A]C[JL: black is too kind. there was no reason to answer here. If you want to attack the eye shape, then 'A* is better.]
;W[rp];B[rn]LB[qn:A]C[JL: not dure if this is better than 'A'.]
;W[qn];B[qm];W[ro]
(;B[pn]C[JL: this is an overplay. white is happy to play 'A' as losing the ko would be big for black too and would make some of his stones invested here look rather silly. Better to follow the variation. Simply: this is trying too much. (also this move takes potentiall a liberty from the black group in the future)]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[lp]C[JL: this push is, even though it's from behind, surprisingly good move.]
;B[kp]LB[jq:A]C[JL: simpler to win by playing 'A' instead. This move may even be an overplay.]
;W[kq]C[JL: white's only chance is to create complications. But with weaknesses all over the board...]
;B[kr];W[jq];B[dn]LB[jr:A][cn:B]C[JL: 'A' first as it would be sente for white and it is sente for black. Also 'B' would be much simpler. Now white will create complications.]
;W[dl]C[JL: white complicates the position even more. This move looks like an overplay, but nothing is simple in this position any more.]

(;B[cl]C[JL: i am not sure I like this move as it is so defensive.]
;W[ck];B[dk]MA[cl]C[twisting cross- -
I almost use the tesuji to deal with my stones and i can always get profits through it.

JL: a tesuji is not always the best move. I seriously doubt that the marked move was any good.]
;W[cm];B[bl];W[dm]MA[dn]C[JL: now the marked stone looks ugly.]

(;B[cj];W[fg]LB[jr:A][lh:B][bm:C]C[JL: black should ignore this move, and play 'A' first, then 'B'. White should have blocked at 'A'  or 'C' first - he has potential for lots of territory in the corner.]
;B[eg]C[JL: this is just too small. There was nothing white can do here. This area is unimportant to the outcome of the game.]
;W[eh];B[fh]LB[dg:A]C[JL: no need for this move. Simply 'A' locally better as white will then have cutting points to protect - now you force him to play where he wants to play.]
;W[gg];B[dg];W[dh];B[ch];W[ei]
(;B[ej]C[JL: the variation is probably better.];W[fi];B[fj]
;W[gi];B[gj]LB[lh:A]C[JL: 'A' better as it is very severe and also enlarges the black bottom. The move black played it slow and gote.]
;W[cg]MA[fe][ff]LB[bg:A]C[JL: For black, 'A' is simpler as the marked stones are quite worthless and unimportant at this stage of the game, but the sequence you played seems stronger.]
;B[df]MA[ff][fe][ed]C[JL: are those stones worth anything really?]
;W[bm];B[bk];W[bh];B[ci];W[bg];B[dd]C[JL: lots of bad aji in white corner now.]
;W[ef];B[ee];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[bf];W[bi];B[bj];W[ag];B[ai]
;W[gc];B[hi];W[gh];B[lh]LB[je:A][kg:B]C[A is black's order

JL: actually black would neverplay 'A' here, but 'B', if white ignores. Hard for white to salvage the game, so ignoring this is probably the right move sacrificing the stones here and making gains in the lower left corner. It is the only place for white to make cash.]
;W[kg];B[kh]LB[jr:A]C[JL: white should probably ignore this move - black should have played at 'A'.]
;W[jg];B[ni]LB[sg:A][rm:B][jr:C]C[JL: too tight? Remember that white 'A' makes the side much smaller - also there is white 'B'. Also, it is impossible for white to cut here anyhow. Better to crawl, starting with 'C' and if possible, at some point connect at 'B'.]
;W[jh]LB[jr:A]C[JL: silly small move. 'A' much bigger and white's only hope.]

(;B[ep]LB[jr:A]C[Is the touching hand on the right direction?

JL: you're winning easily, no need to start fighting. Instead simple moves like 'A' are much better.]

(;W[do]C[JL: seems rahter conservative.]
(;B[eo]C[JL: too heavy. The variation offers a better sequence.]

(;W[en]C[JL: the variation is better for white.];B[dq];W[cq]
;B[cp];W[co];B[cr];W[bq];B[er];W[fq];B[eq];W[fr]C[JL: this surely is an overplay. Black can eaily live there and it is likely these stones will be under attack.]
;B[br];W[bp]
(;B[fn];W[em];B[hq];W[ip]C[JL: white's moves here are unrealistic.]

;B[jp];W[lr]
(;B[iq]C[JL: the variation is better. no need to give white anything here.]
;W[mr]C[JL: white is so happy to get this gift.];B[qs]C[JL: not sure this is the right move, but i am lousy regarding corner life and death so I am not going to say anything :)]

(;W[hm];B[il];W[fm];B[gm];W[gl];B[hl];W[ji];B[nl]LB[rm:A]C[JL: how about 'A' instead as it is much bigger.]
;W[mh];B[nh];W[mi];B[li]C[JL: no reason to play this move unless you plan to kill the white stones. No need to complicate so simple endgame moves near the sides of the boards are better.]
;W[mj];B[nj];W[lj];B[od]LB[qh:A][rm:B]C[JL: taking this stone would have been sente for white, but still 'A' and 'B' are bigger.]

;B[kk];W[am];B[tt];W[rs];B[qr];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[JL: end comments about your (black) play: your reading skill seems to be quite good for a player of your rank. The bad points in your game is the habit of playing aji-keshi, and also the tendency of playing small, irrelevant moves while ignoring the whole board strategy. Learning to distingush what is big and what is small is critical. One last hint: when you're ahead, play simple and safe - it is the one who is behind who needs to fight. You had a good game going on throughout the game, but you allowed white to complicate it many times needlessly. Counting the score every now and then during the game helps a lot when estimating the situation.

I hope these comments help you to enjoy the game even more.]
