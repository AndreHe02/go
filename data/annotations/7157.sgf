****Comments****
Hello, Daniele.  My name is Brian, and I will do my best to review for the white side.

This is my first time doing a review, so please disregard any mistakes that I have made.  There are a couple of branches that are not relevant, and I've marked them as such.  

If nothing else, I hope that you find at least something in the review helpful.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq]C[****Comments****
I am not sure whether I really like D3 here or not.  Please refer to my comments for move 6.

Of course, it is still early in the game, and I think the opening is certainly playable.]
;B[oc]
(;W[cj]C[is it a good idea?

****Comments****
This is still only move 6, so there are a lot of possibilities, and a lot of strategies that you can have.  One thing that you can consider during your games, though, is the direction of play in your stones.

Stones can have influence, and I personally like to use that influence - or prevent my opponent from getting too much influence!

Your stones at D17 and at D3 are facing one another prior to move 6.  This makes it tempting for the opponent to want to break in.  In that sense, I think that C10 is not a bad play.

A couple of other ideas can be seen in the variations.


Note: I have somewhat conflicting ideas about which is better (somewhere around C10 like you played, or on the black side).  It may depend on your strategy, but either way seems like it's losing a bit for white.  

You want to keep black from taking advantage of your D17 and D3 stones facing one another...  But at the same time, you want to keep black from getting a lot of influence around Q10.

This might lead you to reconsider making the facing stones at D17 and D3 in the first place with this board setup.]
;B[qk]C[****Comments****
Black playing at R9 is part of the reason that I would consider playing there myself as white at move 6.  However, if I were black, I would probably play Q10 instead of R9.  It may just be a matter of style, though.

Still, at my level, it is hard for me to say that either way is absolutely best for sure :-)]

(;W[qo]C[****Comments****
R5 is good in the sense that it stops black from making a corner enclosure.  However, I'd be a bit careful of getting attacked (this again depends on your own strategy).

You might be interested in reading about the Chinese Opening (http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChineseFuseki).  This is NOT the chinese opening (Black has P17 and R16), but perhaps black has even more influence than in the Chinese Opening here.

In the Chinese Opening, it is sometimes thought of a mistake to plunch right in at R5, because you can easily get attacked early in the game.  One idea to consider is shown in the variation.

Bottom line: This move is good in some ways, but white can be attacked!]
;B[qp]C[****Comments****
Black induces white to become heavy here.  This sets white up to be attacked.

This can be expected, though, since white jumped into black's influence.

This way of playing is still feasible for white, though, I think.]
;W[po]C[****Comments****
Natural response.];B[np]C[****Comments****
Black continues attack, while seeking territory.];W[ol]C[****Comments****
This is an interesting idea.  I think I like it.  You might also consider P9.

You might consider sacrificing the Q5 stones with either of these options, if you can get enough in return.]
;B[pm];W[om];B[pl]
(;W[on]C[****Comments****
You connect your stones.  This is, of course important.  When I first look at this, I feel that it is a little slow - namely, it feels to have only one purpose.  It's good to have multi-purpose moves...

On the other hand, Q8 seems to have about one purpose, too, so P6 may not be that bad.]
;B[ok];W[pj]C[i think this one is a mistake...

****Comments****
I think that this idea is OK, but it depends on how you want to follow it up.  

I think it is a good idea to peep stones, but typically those stones should accomplish a purpose.  If you plan to later use Q10, or use its influence in any way, then Q10 is a good move.

One bad part about Q10 is that it strengthens the P9 stone.]
;B[pk]
(;W[ml]C[****Comments****
I think that O9 is fine here, too.  See the variation.];B[nk]

(;W[nl]C[****Comments****
You get connected, but I don't like the shape that much.  This shape of stones at O8 seems somewhat inefficient.  Maybe a move like N6 would create better eyeshape.]
;B[lp]C[****Comments****
White's shape is quite inefficient this way, I think.];W[hq]
C[****Comments****
H3 is a good point.  I think it would have been good for white or black, so it's not small.  Be careful of your N8 gruop getting attacked.  A move like N9 by white would help strengthen the group a lot, I think.]
;B[mk]C[****Comments****
Black plays N9 so you can't, though.

This makes the top left have more potential, and also makes your group threatened :-(]
;W[ic]C[Black has a big moyo, I need territory.

****Comments****
The idea is good, I think.  You need to watch out for it.  It might have been better if you played N9 before black, though.

Still, J17 is certainly reasonable if you are confident of the survival of N8.]
;B[kl]C[****Comments****
And black attacks!];W[ll];B[kn]C[****Comments****
I'm basically commenting for white, but this seems unnatural to me.

I think black should M9.  It helps his top left, and he can keep chasing you.]
;W[lk]C[****Comments****
This is the only move I would play, I think.  Great direction.]
;B[kk];W[lj];B[kj]
(;W[li]C[****Comments****
The idea of getting out is alright, but I would try to press down on black ASAP.  I might do N11 instead.  Black surely won't be killed (unless he is silly), but you want to press him down as quick as you can.  It helps your group out, and makes his area smaller.

(Small variation)];B[ni];W[mg]C[****Comments****
Pressing is the right idea.  Always consider the cut when playing a knight's move, though (except in blitz, maybe).

In this case, the cut seems a bit harmful.];B[mh];W[lh];B[lg]
C[****Comments****

;W[rd]C[****Comments****
Reasonable idea, I think, but maybe you can just leave it as is after S16 (you might come back to it later for a ko threat, for example).]

In blitz, I would play B7 almost without hesitation.  You threaten to connect at B6 or at B9.  I think black can still live at B8 after B7 though, but I'm not quite sure.]
;B[bk];W[bj];B[gd];W[hd]C[I thouht to H15, but it seemed to complicated...

****Comments****
H15 is the supposed "right" way to cut in terms of shape, I think, but you should play moves that you can read the consequences of...

Or at least play them for your own reason.];B[he];W[ge];B[gf]

I am still wondering if B7 works, so I am making a variation for the heck of it.

(Later) I don't know for sure if B7 works or not, but I might still try it.  

I'm thinking that it doesn't work, though, and that black will live.]

I think this was due to jumping in too quickly at R5, ultimately.  And then, with inefficient shape, white got attacked.]

Basically, I think that black's top left was simply too big.  He was able to attack your group, which started from white jumping in at R5.

Jumping in at R5 is playable, I think, but you have to have efficient shape, and watch out for getting attacked.  This didn't work out that well, since black had so much influence.


Also, if white played around Q10 in the first place, before black played R9, she might have prevented some unnecessary troubles.]

Whitecan continue to attack black, and also gets good influence on the bottom.  Furthermore, when white gets the opportunity, white can get into the top right with a move like O11.

If white pursues this attack on N7, and if N9 becomes too weak, it may be reasonable to sacrifice the stones.]

;W[jp]C[****Comments****
White is not bad, either.  White has a lot of influence at the bottom now!

Another thing to note: black now has stones at Q3 and Q5, which is another type of enclosure.

White has effectively prevented black from extending (around K4, for example) from the extension.  

I like this result!])))
(;W[po]C[****Comments****
I think that Q5 is also relatively big at this point.  It has multiple potential purposes:

1.) It stops black from making a corner enclosure with Q5 or R5.

2.) It (somewhat) counteracts the influence of the P17 and R16 stones.  Corner enclosures can work really well with the sides!  This brings about a third idea, which is shown in the next variation.]
)
(;W[pj]C[****Comments****
Another idea to consider is playing somewhere around Q10.  The influence of P17 and P16 is something that I am thinking about a lot.

If black puts a stone at Q10, for example, his stones are working together well!  So playing a white stone here before him can stop him from getting the influence!

The bottom line: I think it's important to think about the influence of stones, and try to think about it from both the perspective of black and of white.

Of course, at this stage in the game, there are probably a lot of feasible options!]
