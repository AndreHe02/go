(;B[cn];W[co]C[Jumping up to D6 would be more typical than F5, but I like the idea of claiming a huge territory on the right.]

(;B[fo];W[dn];B[cm];W[dm];B[fm]C[I guess that was your idea. There is a go proverb: before you sacrifice a stone add one more to it. Like most such proverbs, it really only applies in certain situations. I'm not sure that this is one, but your moyo is impressive.]

(;B[ff];W[gd];B[ge];W[id];B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[gk]C[I don't understand Black's next move. There is more territory at the bottom. I would take it by playing around K8. White is losing badly.  There is no reason to make futile plays where he is strong.]

(;B[ek];W[el];B[dk];W[ck];B[fl];W[pm]
(;B[qn]C[Perhaps R5, R4, or R9  wo
uld have been better. (DA).

Yes, the white stone is weak. There is no need to attack it like this. Just take territory.]
;W[qm]C[Again, the usual response to an attachment is to add a stone (this is reminiscent of your play at move 15.]

(;B[qk];W[rn]C[Black's next is a silly sacrifice. It would be better to save the stone.]

(;B[ro];W[qo];B[qp];W[po];B[oo];W[pn]C[Black probably should protect against the cut. A move like O3 would secure the lower side nicely.]

(;B[lk];W[op];B[no];W[oq];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr]C[I think that white misses the kill here. R3 seems to do the job. However, even that is difficult to read out (and I might be wrong. A move like Q2 forces black to live in gote, which allows white to live as well.]

(;W[sp];B[pr]C[Consider S4.]
(;W[pq];B[qq];W[or];B[qs]C[White needs to come out with his weak group if he is going to save it. Black is alive in the corner now.]

;B[ml];W[rl];B[rk];W[lm];B[nl]C[White needs another move at the bottom. He can play to the critical square OR try to connect on the left.]

(;W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob]
(;B[so]C[Silly move. What would be best here? Perhaps N15 or N14. (DA)

Yes; T5 is small.  How about killing white's group at the bottom? N2 kills the bottom. Of course, it will try to escape, but to where? Connection to the G9 stones might work, but black would develop great thickness chasing the white group.  
Alternatively, Something around K8 could be played in sente.]

(;W[sn]
(;B[sl]C[Another silly move, costing me sente and not accomplishing anythin
g. N15 or N14 still looks good. (DA)

You are right. Everybody on the lower right is alive, so this is small.]

(;W[sm];B[ql];W[sk];B[rj];W[rp]C[The next move (T3) is not necessary. It is a one-point move at a stage in the game when moves are worth 10 points or so. You need to brush up on life and death.]

(;B[sq];W[oe]C[Black's next is also very small. If white want's to crawl along the first line, let him.  You get move in thickness than he gets in territory.]

(;B[sj]C[Ditto for white's reply. What's at stake here? Two points?]

(;W[sl];B[pe];W[oh];B[ng]C[Was this a good move? Whether it was or not, am I already losing t
he game here? (DA)

It doesn't look so bad. I'm still partial to K8 or so.];W[of]
;B[og];W[pg];B[ph];W[qg];B[nh];W[qf]C[White's stones are really quite weak. You should have played with more confidence.  If you just take at P11, white can use the sacrifice to get a little at the top, but that's not much.]

(;B[qe];W[qa]
(;B[rc];W[re];B[rd];W[qh];B[pi]C[Too greedy. S14 was probably best. (DA)]
;W[rb]C[S14 now was called for. R17 serves no purpose.]
(;B[qc];W[se]C[Now, finally, black has made enough mistakes that he is in trouble. I'm not sure that T18 saves you here.  I think that you need to play T13 first. Notice it's relationship to R15 and the fact that it cannot be captured because of it's monkey-jump connection to S10. In fact, I think that T13 can still save black.]

(;B[sb]C[I was thinking of playing T16, but I decided it wouldn
't work. Now I think T16 would have saved my group and probably killed White's R
13 group. (DA)];W[ra]C[Still, black can save himself with T13.]
