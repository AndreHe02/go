;B[pd]C[Hello reviewer,  thank you for your time and comments.

I've been in quite a slump lately - can't seem to progress past 4k.

This game had a lot of groups and a lot of attack and defense.  However, I wasn't able to capitalize on any of my attacks or kill any groups.

Please comment liberally - I value your opinion!

----

Alex: Hi, I'm Alex Weldon, 4d CGA/AGA. I hope my comments are helpful. Overall, I think your play lacked a plan and had a certain sense of desperation to it, whereas you weren't in a bad spot for most of the game and could have won if you'd thought a bit more and played more calmly.

That makes sense, if you're in a slump. Your slump undermines your confidence, leading to pessimistic and rash play, so you lose more games, don't progress, feel even worse, etc.

Within an individual game, your psychology seems to be affect you as well. You get an attack that you feel should kill, fail to do so, and then start flailing around aimlessly because you're disappointed that things didn't go as planned and feel you're behind.

I don't know what to suggest to get you out of your slump except maybe taking a break from rated games and teaching weaker players instead, giving you a chance to remind yourself of what you already know and restoring your confidence. During an individual game, if you feel something didn't go your way, take a deep breath and look around the board. You overlooked a lot of things this game and played a lot of weird moves that were beneath your level, making me think you could have won this game easily if you were thinking clearly.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[fc]LB[co:B][do:A]C[I know A/B is probably bigger, but I wanted to form a moyo.

Alex: I don't see anything particularly wrong with this. A is certainly playable as well, as is Q10 to make san-ren-sei.

Making this approach, though, you want to be somewhat flexible. If you're dead set on making a moyo, san-ren-sei is probably better.]
;W[id]
(;B[ff]C[Alex: This move is thin. If you want to jump out, F15 is normal, but I don't like that joseki for Black because it ends up with his stones too low.

Instead, I'd be flexible. Maybe after White decides to pincer, a moyo isn't in the cards after all. I would probably just invade the corner, though C14 is also playable. See variations.]
;W[df];B[kd];W[if];B[ed]C[Alex: See, this is the problem with F14. You're thin so you feel the need to go back and patch up, but inducing White to play D17 gives him a huge corner.]
;W[dc];B[ih]C[This attack too soon?

Alex: Well, having played the moves you have so far, I think you have to try to attack severely in order to be consistent... you can't just continue to run out with F14 because White no longer has to answer on the left side, since you've completed his corner for him.

I just don't think this was the best plan to begin with.];W[hg]

TR[ih][kh][hi][hj]C[I was pretty happy with the marked thickness, but why wasn't able to use it?

Alex: The trouble is you're still a bit thin, and you've given White a lot of territory. The game's not over yet though.]

(;W[qh]C[Alex: This is a gift from White, since his position on top isn't quite settled yet. If he'd just attached at Q17 or something, the game would be a lot easier for him - see variation.]

(;B[ph]C[Alex: I think your problem here is that you're attaching to the weak stone to attack the strong group, which is backwards. Instead, lean on the strong group to attack the weak stone.

See variation.];W[qg];B[pg];W[pi];B[oc];W[re]C[Alex: Bad move by White. Either P11 or O17 is bigger.]

;B[rd];W[qd];B[qe];W[qf];B[pe];W[rc]LB[qi:A]C[Alex: White's cutting point at A is very severe. You should cut there as soon as the fight up top dies down.]

Alex: Probably, yes.];W[kb];B[lb];W[kc];B[hd];W[lc];B[ld];W[la]

(;B[do]TR[lg][mg][kh][nh][hi][ki][li][ej][hj][ij][jj][fk]C[ok, i'm a little disappointed with w' life, but i have pretty good prospects with the marked thickness, no?

Alex: This is the wrong direction of play. It's too close to your thickness and invites White to build a low, stable position on the lower side, which is where you want to be getting your moyo.]
;W[fp]C[urgg, that hurts my influence.  i should've kikaried another way?

Alex: Yes.];B[hq];W[fn];B[go];W[fo];B[cq];W[cr];B[dp];W[eq]

(;B[in]LB[fj:A]C[Alex: I think you should play a few probes on the left first, because you have a defect at A to worry about.]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[kq]LB[on:A]C[wrong direction?  better at A?

Alex: Yeah, or maybe Q6 is safer. You still have the cut at R11 and the attachment at C11, so White doesn't really have any territory. You just need to wrap up the game now.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[op];B[pq];W[pm];B[nn];W[no];B[on]
LB[mn:A]C[better at A?

Alex: Nah, then White will connect at R10 and be back in the game. O6 for O5 was a good kikashi, but it's time to set aside the attack for the time being and cut at R11 before it's too late.]
;W[mn];B[nl];W[ol];B[mm];W[ln];B[gl]C[Alex: You should play C11 as a probe before trying to fix your aji directly.]
;W[cj]C[w's c10 makes me think i missed a chance to take that spot, in order to attack the lower left.

Alex: Yes. You definitely missed a chance here.];B[ck];W[dk]

I'd call this the game-losing move. See variation.];W[im];B[hm]
