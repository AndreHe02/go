C[[Calvin\]: Hi.  Keep in mind that I'm only about a 5k player, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.  I'll try to restrict my comments to things I feel strongly about and shouldn't be too controversial, but there are always important things I will miss or be mistaken about; otherwise, I'd be stronger myself :-)

Mostly, the thing that jumps out at me in this game is improper contact plays by black, and suboptimal responses to those plays by white.

Also, black seems to follow white around too much, answering even small moves by white.  Think about tenuki (playing elsewhere) more.]

[sd][qe][re][se][qf][rf][sf][qg][rg][sg][qh]LB[pd:A]C[It is considered polite to play one's first move near the opponent's left hand.  In online go, that is perceived by convention to be the upper right hand quadant of the board, with bias to the right half of that quadant.  Basically, any of the marked points are polite, although some may be strategically unsound. :-)

Professional game records will usually start here.

D16 should therefore be at A (Q16).];W[pd];B[dp];W[qp]
(;B[dj]C[[Calvin\]: There is nothing wrong with this fuseki for black, called the sanrensei, but with  white at R4, it is also good to approach the lower right corner immediately.  See variations.]

(;W[pq]C[[Calvin\]: Overconcentrated for white.]
(;B[nd]LB[nc:A]C[[Calvin\]: Usually the low approach is better for territory, and is used even in moyo games.  I'd suggest A (O17).]
;W[kd];B[nf];W[qf];B[nh];W[pi]
(;B[oq]C[[Calvin\]: This move is the first that is truly questionable even for kyu players.  First of all, white can ignore it, because black has no good follow-up.  Therefore the move is wasted.   Also, white would not play here (P3) now if given a chance.  See variation for a better idea.]

(;W[ql]C[[Calvin\]: White has better moves.  See variation.]

(;B[pp]LB[qo:A]C[[Calvin\]: Better at A (R5).];W[qq]
(;B[kq]C[[Calvin\]: Black touches a weak white stone.  This makes that stone stronger.   The reason is that this is now a contact fight, both black and white have the same number of liberties (3), but it's now white's move, so white has the advantage locally (only considering the stones K3 and L3.   See variation.]

;W[hd]C[[Calvin\]: Compare this to black playing here first.  Locally, it's a good move for white, but not urgent.  White needed to defend the lower group.]

(;B[fd]SQ[nd][nf][nh]C[[Calvin\]: Black's marked stones are weak, so locally, this is the wrong direction of play.  Anyway, the urgent area is at the bottom.  See variation.]
;W[gb];B[fb]SQ[fd]LB[gp:A]C[[Calvin\]: This move is inconsistent.  When black played the marked stone at F16, that means black doesn't care about territory at the top.  If black wanted territory at the top, he should have played F17 on the third line instead of F16.  Now we see there are two stones doing the job one could have done.

I would ignore G18 and play at A (G4), hoping to build a moyo on the left side and put pressure on white's weak bottom group.]
;W[jb]SQ[kd]C[[Calvin\]: White's second line plays are a little goofy.  I think white has misunderstood the purpose of the marked stone, which is to attack the black O16 stones.  Since it is fourth-line stone, it should be treated lightly, maybe sacrificed if necessary, but white looks like he is trying to make territory with it, so a lot of extra moves are being played.]

;W[ci];B[cj]C[[Calvin\]: Excellent response.  Correct.];W[cm]
C[[Calvin\]: White now has three weak groups, and black only has 1. It is hard to imagine white winning this game, but of course that's why we are amateurs. :-)

Let's see what happens...]
(;B[dm]C[[Calvin\]: Okay, this attachment helps white.  Black has many better moves.  See variations.]
;W[cp]SQ[cm][dm][fq][gq]LB[dn:A][fp:B]C[[Calvin\]: White's attachment is okay here, because black is already strong and white is weak.  Still, as white I would probably prefer to hane at A or B first.  In general, you would not often see strong players leave pairs of stones like the marked ones alone for long, because whoever plays a hane next in those areas can gain an advantage.]
;B[co]C[[Calvin\]: Good.  This responds to a contact and separates white.]

;B[on]LB[gp:A][jp:B][fk:C]C[[Calvin\]: I prefer A or B to seal in white's weak group at the bottom.  C is also seems interesting.  I get the feeling that black is following white around too much, which is a bad habit.]

;W[nj]
(;B[mj]
(;W[mk];B[lk];W[ml];B[ll]MA[lj][mh]C[[Calvin\]: Black is leaving a lot of cutting points this way.  Moves 75 and 79 are white we call "pushing from behind" and it's usually bad.]

LB[fk:A]C[[Calvin\]: Black seems to be playing as if he thinks the center will become a big territory.  Maybe he fantasizes that the 40-points marked will be his.  Go forward in the game to see how much black actually make here.

This is unlikely, because white still has the hane at (F9) A and the cutting points marked to exploit.]

(;B[go]SQ[gp][gq]LB[io:A]C[[Calvin\]: Attaching to the marked stones, which have 5 liberties before the attachment, reduces the liberties on white's marked stones to 4.

C[[Calvin\]: So this was an interesting game.   Both players made errors, of course, but black should work on understanding the principles of contact fights and when to use attachments.  In general, attaching to a lone stone will strengthen the opponent, so an attachment should only be used when the opponent's stone is already strong.

However, if the opponent's stone/group has a lot of liberties, the attachment may have no effect, so it takes some practice and experience to know when to use attachments and when not to.  One thing I will say is that it is usually a bad idea to ignore attachment to a lone stone.

See http://senseis.xmp.net/?ContactPlay and other pages linked from it for more advice, or ask a stronger player you know for tips.

I recommend Bruce Wilcox's Contact Fights and Sector Fights software at your level to help drill in some basic principles.]
