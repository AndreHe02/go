;W[ne];B[pf]C[White 10 Q18 is joseki and would be good here.  (see  variation).
Even better would be White 10 O13, to flatten out the san ren sei.   White 10 is the first bad move in the game, so 9 perfect moves is pretty  good!]

(;W[hc]C[frakt2: Black not entirely certain how to continue  with L16 stone.

Jared: Black has a lot of options.  The big points at C10 and F3 look  appealing, as would a move around K4.  There is no immediate threat on  L16, and H10 is low, so black need not respond.  That said, since white  missed O13, now may be the best chance for black to grab it. See  variations.  Defending the corner (i.e. P18) first may be atractive,  but is probably inferior to O13.    But see variations nevertheless.]

(;B[kf];W[mg]C[White N13 is beging for trouble.  The  knight's move leaves a cutting point that is beging for trouble later.   Better to take the key point of O13.  One space jumps are seldom  bad.]
;B[he]C[Q12 instead of H15 is probably best now.  Then the  three white stones could come under strong  attack.]
;W[le];B[ke];W[id]C[J16 is a  terrible move.  It does nothing for white and only strengthens black.   J16 is a "thank you" move.  Black is *forced* to gain amazing thickness  radiating throughout the center of the board.  This will indirectly hurt  the weak O15 group.]
;B[ie];W[kb]C[L18 is a very  submissive move on the second line.  A second line move in the opening is  almost surely a good time to think about tenuki.  E3 or a move around K4  seem very tempting.  The black stones around J15 will prevent white from  building  a left side moyo.  Locally, P18 once again looks like a good  move, but is gote.]

(;B[ld]C[M16 is a "thank you" move that just  strengthens  white.];W[mc]
;B[pc]C[Q21 is now a good move.   Necessary. But compare this result to the variation following black 19 at  P17.  Notice how bad M16 was.  The white group around O17 is no longer  under threat of attack.]
;W[dj]C[D10 would be better at C10.   The black gropu around J15 make sit difficult for white to build san ren  sei type moyos.  O3 might be even better yet.]
;B[jd]C[Once  again, K16 just strengthens white.  Ouch.];W[jc]C[D14 seems  aimless.  The black K16 group is not weak (although it is getting weaker  as it looses liberties such as K17), so it doesn't need help if that is  wehat D14 was for.  Since the center seems to be played out due to the  black group at J15 and the white group poking it's nose out at N13, it  would seem best to go for territory.  F3 looks best.   If you must play  in the upper left, consider C16 or B15.]

(;B[df];W[cd];B[fd]C[F16 seems aimless.  It  has terrible shape with regards to D14.  What was the point of D14 if  black is going to play F16 next?  Since C16 is submissive, black should  play elsewhere.   i.e. F3  Even so, the D14-C16 trade was bad for  black.]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[ff];W[gd];B[ge];W[fc];B[hd];W[gc];B[ic];W[ib]C[White  got a lot of territory on the top.  Black's thickness is great, but is  offset by the white stones at D4 and D10.  Black will not be able to  match white's big upper territory.  White is ahead.  That said, Black  should play *away* from thickness.  i.e. F3, not  C10.]
;B[cj];W[ck];B[dk];W[dl];B[ek];W[bj];B[ci];W[cl]C[Locally, the  exchange on the left side  was good for black.  But the thickness from C11 and F9 overlaps with the  thickness from the F14-L14 group.  So C10 was too close to thickness to  start with.  Many players would be tempted to play E11, which is the  proper local move after C8, but it is not neccessary in view of the  F14-L14 thickness.

Also, Black gains kudos for being the first player to recognize the  importance of the lower side to this  game.]
;B[jp];W[qq]C[Black Q3 should be at S4.  The  right side is bigger than the bottom.  Always block on the bigger side]

(;B[pq]C[.];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[rn];W[qn];B[po];W[rm];B[pn]C[White R7 must be at T6.  White surely realizes this after S4.]

(;W[qm];B[rp];W[sn];B[rq];W[ol];B[nm]C[Black has gained quite a bit.  Black's lower right corner  is big.   Black may get some center territory, and the upper right is also  territory.  This now rivals white's upper side, and lower left.  Black is in  the game again.  White's error at R7 was costly.  Having flattened black's  moyo with P8, white should probably secure life for the S7 group.  S10 shouts  to be white's next move.  This makes life for the S7 group and destroys  black's right side.]

(;W[oj]C[White P10 is an overplay.  White  should be punished  immediately with Q9, the key shape point.  P10 should *smell* like an  overplay.  It looks so "loose" in the middle of all this black strength.]

(;B[pi];W[pk]C[White got Q9.  Good shape by white.   Buit black's territory on the right is more solid becasue of Q11 nad  black got sente to play F3 (at last!), so this result seems alright for  black.]
;B[fq];W[dq];B[fo]C[D3, F5 seem  reasonable. The lower side is now very big.  White must invade.  Even so.  the invasion is likely to be risky in light of black's thickness.  White  would like to play K6 to flatten out the moyo.  This would lead to a  terrifc fight as black attacked K6 (see variation), so perhaps K7 would  be enough.]

(;W[kh]C[L12 misses the point.  This is basically dame.   Black  would cut immediately (see variation) if the lower side were not bigger  (i.e. K6).]

(;B[de]C[D15 is terrible.  White should ignore it an  play K6.   D15 is gote.]

(;W[ed]C[E16 saves 6 points in reverse sente.  Surely  there are  bigger points.  If black wants to take 2 stones in the middle game, white  should be very content.]
;B[ei]C[Playing E11 is like a huge lion  cowering in front of a mouse.  The black group is massive.  If you are  really worried, play B11, or F8.  Better yet, the cut at M13 is begging  to be made.]
;W[bg]C[B13 is aimless and provokes B11.  B13  should be at B11 (of course K6 or K7 are probably still  better)]
;B[bi];W[cg];B[dh]C[C13 and D12  are both very small];W[el]C[Now we see E8.  This is pretty big  as it revives the aji of D10.  Good move.  It also aims at  K6.]
;B[mq]C[What!  I can't believe this move.  K6!  (or maybe  F9 now that E8 is played).  We keep seeing big lions cower like dogs.   Black will surely lose with moves like N3.]
;W[gg]C[White can't  make this peep.  J11, for example shows the folly of this.  Black still  has the cut at M13, too.]

(;B[gf];W[gi];B[jm]C[K7, very good.  Since  white obstinately refuses to play K6, black gets a move in that area  in.]
;W[ej]C[frakt2: Perhaps K7 better at E10.    Jared: No not at all, but you have to extend to E9.  Presumably F10 was  an oversight.]

C[frakt2: S9 a bad move

Jared: Yes.  S11 good.  And in light of what follows, it looks like S13  would be better at  R13, or perhaps P11.  But regardless, black is in  trouble.]

(;B[rg]C[R13 is probably too greedy.  Probably best to  take big  points now, like E2 and P18.  Locally, R12 is probably better than R13.]
