C[I thought this would be a good game to send in for review, as I lost it solidly but didn't make any terrible blunders.  I am not sure how I manage to lose games like this, where my opponent throws away his moves again and again, so I am hoping that sharp eyes will be able to see, in this game, large holes in my playing that I should be working on.

I'd appreciate criticism on some specific points that I've commented, but also on important points that I've overlooked even in my own review.  Finally, any stylistic comments would also be welcome--it helps to hear comments such as "you are too aggressive," or "you do not pay enough attention to your opponent," as these serve as a reality-check beyond the basical technical aspects of the game.

Thank you in advance for the review.

Baga: Hi, I am about 12kyu at the moment.
Global Comment: Your game was lacking glaring errors as you pointed out. Therefore Ive concentrated on basically giving you some alternative moves and thoughts at game and shape defining junctures.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp]C[Can't go wrong with the nirensei.

B: Do notice that if black gets the next move at E16 it is a VERY powerful corner enclosure. You didnt play wrong by any means.. just something to keep your eye on.]
;B[cn];W[ed]LB[fq:A]C[Would it have been better to respond to C6?  It worked out alright, I think.

B: Move A is more urgent. Urgent moves first. Always.]
(;B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[df];W[jc];B[kd]LB[kc:A][jd:B]C[It's possible that I could have ignored this.  Pincering the C6 stone looks particularly good to me at the moment.

B: Id play A rather than B. A flatter longer shape is more likely to live, plus you destabilize his upper right to boot.]
;W[jd];B[kc];W[fp]LB[cl:A]C[Seems weak.  Should have been a pincer to break up black's potential territory on the left?

B: im inclined to agree. Go is all about doing more than one thing with every move. With A you have the potential to kill and make territory. As a side effectit will strengten your position for fighting and/or surviving at the Right side of the board if something happens there in future moves.]
;B[je];W[ie];B[ke];W[qf]LB[cl:A];B[pf];W[pg];B[of]C[My opponent seemed to like attachments.

I believe the variations i show is better. 
Your move is too solid, yet in spite of its solidity it doesnt guarantee life.]

(;W[qg];B[qe];W[qk]C[I've taken the right side but the upper right corner is looking very strong now.]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[qo];W[po];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr]
(;W[qn]LB[ck:B][cl:A]C[Maybe S7 would have been a more powerful attack?

B: You cannot really kill it. Its a classic pattern. Your objective is to contain it so your opponent makes only a little territory and you make a lot of influence on the rest of the board.
NOTE: A move at A (or maybe B) is looking very juicy as you now have good formation at the other end of the board.]
;B[rn];W[qm];B[rm];W[rl];B[qs];W[ps]C[Wasn't watching my shape here.  Definitely a mistake.]
;B[pr];W[pq];B[os]C[Bad form for black.  P2 would have been much more damaging.]
;W[or];B[ps];W[ns];B[rs];W[nq]C[Black gives me a beautiful wall.]
;B[jp]LB[hq:A][iq:B]C[
B: I would rather play A ( or mayyybe B).
It will give you influence. If you secure at A, regardless of your opponents moves you can keep threatning his tenuous baseless formation and with the same moves make territory.]

(;W[ko]LB[hq:A][iq:B]C[I couldn't find a move that would drive black into my wall.  This move seems poor in retrospect because it potentially hurts my position on the left, and is probably too close to my thick position.]
;B[kp];W[jo];B[mp];W[lo];B[lp];W[mo]C[Should have been at J5 or J4?]
;B[io];W[in]C[Actually, cutting at J4 right away looks promising.

B: Yes probably. But you shouldnt have gotten yourself into this situation in the first place.
But regardless now that you are in it...

First decide...do you think you can kill it? 50-50 chance? or better? If its a good chance go for it. If its 50-50 only extend from your huge right moyo.]
;B[ho]C[B: Just some possibilities. the exact move doesnt matter, the IDEA to capitalize on your strengths does.]

(;W[hn];B[go]
(;W[fo]C[Suddenly I'm in a rush to defend my corner.

B: I would attack at A, though it is riskier.
Also I dont see how this move was a good defense.];B[gn]C[Fortunately black isnt' in a rush to attack it.]
;W[ip]C[Late.

B: You should proceed on the assumption that, if it is difficult to kill, dont try to kill it, but raher to mold it to influence other parts of the board...or just ignore it. Kill-thirst doesnt get you anywhere in go...if you would see games played by ..say 10kyu+ most games go without a single dead formation.]
;B[hp];W[iq];B[hq];W[jq];B[kq];W[kr];B[mr]C[I was definitely biting off more than I could chew in hoping to kill the black group.]
;W[nr];B[lr];W[js];B[ir];W[np];B[jr]C[Black played a lot of unnecessary moves such as this one.]

;W[ep];B[dq];W[cr];B[cq];W[bq];B[gq];W[br]C[I'm probably lucky to be alive at all in this corner.  I don't know if this move was necessary, but it seemed prudent.]
;B[fn];W[og]LB[mh:B][nh:A]C[I start eyeing a moyo on the right.  Should I have tried to cut down black's position on the left first?

B: You should have cut it down when it was still weak. 
As for now...on the balance of things, strengtening your moyo is probably the best thing. Trying to cut down blacks position now may poison your own moyo as the fight for life spreads into the center.
Also A or B is better. Your play  is too solid.];B[mf];W[ng]
;B[jn]C[Unreasonable.];W[jm];B[kn];W[ln];B[im];W[hm];B[il];W[fg]
C[A reducing move, maybe not aggressive enough.

B: You missed a scary possibility. Good thing your opponent did the same.]

;B[dd];W[mg]C[B: Still too solid.];B[lf];W[lg];B[kg]C[Is it possible to invade the upper right at this stage?

;B[jf];W[he];B[ig];W[jh];B[hf];W[gf];B[jb];W[ib];B[ge]C[I guess this was a "hope white doesn't see the double atari" tesuji.]
;W[id];B[kb];W[fb];B[eb];W[fe]LB[re:A][ih:B]C[A wasted move?

B: Probably. A better I suppose. Or cut your opponet off from your moyo at B]
;B[ih];W[jl];B[ij];W[kj]C[This moyo would definitely be a game-winner if I hadn't been so generous with the upper-right.]
