;B[pc];W[md];B[ic]C[too aggressive? R14 better?

I would prefer R14.  If you want to play this way, I think K16 would be better. It puts more pressure on the N16 group.]

C[What do you plan to do if white pincers?  This move lets white use his thickness to attack the R6 stone.  I would prefer to aproach from the other side.]
;W[np]C[This is too easy for black.];B[rp];W[qq];B[qk]C[I think this is a big mistake by white.  The thickness at the top is pretty much useless now.]

This looks OK to me, but wouldn't you rather have a stone at K16 than at J17 now?]

C[start a fight again, good or bad?

Not so good.  It looks like you are trying to separate white groups, but white can capture D14 and and connect.]

;W[ff];B[hi];W[gh];B[fk];W[cf]C[Now white is connected everywhere, and black has  the weak E11 group to worry about.]
;B[be];W[cl];B[ok];W[de]
(;B[hq]C[invade white, correct position?

It may be hard to save both this group and E11.  There is no hurry to invade the bottom because there are several placed you can play to reduce it.

This is a good time to count the score.  Black has about 10 in the lower left, 10 in lower right, 10 in upper center and upper right, and about 20 in the upper left for a total of 50.

White  has about 10 points in the two upper right groups and at most 15 on the left side. With komi that is about 30 points, so if black can hold white to about 20 on the bottom, the game will be close.]

It is hard to tell. White should probably attack the corner harder before starting this.]

(;B[rl]C[Is this needed?  In the endgame, making an un-needed move like this can be expensive. At this point the game is very close.   It is hard to know what the biggest move is, but A13 looks pretty good, reducing white while expanding black.  L11 is also big.

Overall, I think you need to think about where you are going to make your profit before you start an attack.  In the beginning, when you played J3 to attack the O16 group, your profit should have been in the upper left, but K16 would have been bigger and put more pressure on white.  You also need to follow through more on your attacks.  You broke off your attack on the L14 group to play G18, a defensive move that didn't get you much.  Later, you started the H3 invasion while leaving a weak group at F11.   Take a little more time preparing and I think you will win a lot more games.]
