AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,
First of all, thanks for reviewing my game.
This is a game I played against GNUgo. I'm playing handicaped games as W because I used to play in a very conservative way. In this way, I hope to improve my attack.
I had many doubts during the game, so I will try to comment it in detail.
I hope you find it interesting.
Eysenck


To start with, I'm skeptical that playing Gnugo is a good idea.  You'll pick up
bad habits that a human opponent at a similar level of competance wouldn't
allow.

I'll point out some of GNUGo's blunders, even though it isn't listening.]
;W[qp];B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[gp]C[Maybe taking the upper left corner was better. I played here to avoid the developing of a moyo on the lower side.]
;B[jq];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cp];W[dc];B[fo]
(;W[df]C[Now I take the upper left corner in a rather ambitious way, but the lower left groups looks weak.

Too weak in retrospect, but it's understandable that you might not see it as urgent.]
;B[cl];W[nc];B[kd];W[ne]C[I play here to split the two B stones.]
;B[pf];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[qo];W[po]C[
This isn't good.  It's sure to get cut off and your group bottom-left is still dangerously weak.]
;B[ch]C[I could see this B move coming. Maybe I should have fully enclosed the corner, but as I said, I'm trying to improve my attack.]
;W[hd]C[This move looks strange now. Could you tell me what you think and suggest alternatives?]
;B[gr]C[Now my lower left group really looks in trouble.
Actually, besides the upper right, all seems vulnerable in a way or another.
The upper left has an opening for a slide at b14.
For lower right, there is a cut at q4. But that would end up in a stair favorable for W.]
;W[hr]C[
This is a "digging in" kind of move, which if black presses at H3 isn't pretty for white.]
;B[qn];W[pp];B[qi];W[ql]C[
This is a "fight everywhere" sort of move, but questionable at this point.  You got
a freebie when black broke off the attack on the the bottom.  This is going to create
a weak running group based on R8.];B[rp];W[rq];B[hq];W[gq];B[ir]
;W[fr];B[hs]
(;W[dr]C[This is too little.  No matter how it is (correctly) played out, you'll end
up with 1 eye and running, so better to run first, before you're more 
closed in.];B[go];W[cr];B[br];W[bs]
(;B[bf]C[
It's inexcusable that black left the corner here; you got a freebie.  Even so, given
that black has blundered, I would play B3 and seal the deal, and accept some
shrinkage in your top corner, in exchange for no problems on the bottom.]

(;W[jm];B[bh]
(;W[af]C[
This is a small move that preserves territory, but the big questions at this point are the face of the center
and top.  By taking these few points, you're giving black sente which is huge.]

that didn't deserve to die.];W[jf];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[gi]C[
This isn't the right place, since (as seen) you get cut off.  This is where
playing a better move a few turns ago is the key.];B[gh];W[hh]

Automatically responding isn't  always the right thing.  You have a severe problem with a cut at p15]

Summary: you won based on a series of blunders by black.
Your tactics are a little weak but they're not being challenged by playing Gnugo, so you're
getting away with things that you shouldn't.

Step back and look at the bigger picture, so you don't have to fight
your way out of tough situations.];B[tt]TW[aa][ba][ca][da][ea]
