C[I am black. My opponent is ranked as 7d but i think he plays about 4d strenth, so I should be able to get a chance. However, I did not.

In move 117 I blundered. However, hte game was probably lost at that point already.
It would be nice, I you could tell me IF htat is true or not.


Thanks for the review!

Hi!

My name is Jon and I'll be providing the commentary for your review.  My comments start with "Jon:".]
;B[pc];W[qp];B[cd];W[dp];B[qe];W[ic];B[kc]
(;W[ed]LB[ec:B][ic:A]C[Jon:  This approach strikes me as odd.  Because white's stone at A is as close as it is, I'd be worried about black digging underneath white's stones to overconcentrate them (e.g. an attachment underneath at B).

What should white do instead?];B[ec]LB[ic:A]C[Jon:  Good!  Digging underneath with this attachment will strengthen black's corner while reducing white's base on the top considerably.]

(;W[fc]LB[dc:A]TR[ic][ed]C[Jon:  Responding with the usual hane feels a bit dubious to me, like following joseki blindly.  Once black strengthens his stone by drawing back to A, white's three stones will be under pressure from black on both sides.  White must try to find a better alternative if he can.

Can you find a possible alternative for white?];B[dc]
(;W[fd]C[Jon:  Oof!  Strengthening these white stones is necessary, but they're clearly overconcentrated now.]
;B[cf]LB[mc:A]C[this seemed overconcentrated for w.

Jon:  You're absolutely right, white is overconcentrated and under pressure from both sides.  Because of that, he also can't worry about making the invasion at A yet, he's just too weak.]
;W[pj]C[Jon:  A good choice, black wanted this move too to create a framework based on the top right enclosure, so white taking this move first prevents that and limits black's potential for development along the right side.]

(;B[op]C[Ok, I noticed in the game that this is bad.

Jon:  Yeah, when you're trying to approach a corner that already has an extra stone nearby, most likely you'll have to use a more careful approach in order to avoid any trouble.]
;W[lp]LB[pj:A]C[black does not have a good answer, at least I did not find one.

Jon:  Once white pincers, it's tough to find a good way to get out of this since white has the stone at A.]

(;B[om]LB[on:A]TR[lp]C[Jon:  Moving out the pincered stone is the right idea, but because black still has an opportunity to counterattack the marked white stone, I'd prefer to move out slightly more slowly with the one point jump at A since the two point jump has much weaker connectivity.]
;W[qm]
(;B[fq]LB[lp:A][iq:B]TR[om][op]C[Jon:  This was one of the losing moves for black.  Trying to approach the bottom left corner is too early at the moment for two reasons:

1.)  Black still has to save his two marked stones on the bottom right.  Starting a second invasion without settling the first one is very dangerous.

2.)  The white pincer stone at A isn't settled yet.  Since there's a lot of room for it to make a base along the bottom, white can settle while pincering black's approach move by playing B, which would be ideal for him.  Black needs to prevent that by pincering the stone directly.]
;W[iq]LB[lp:A]C[Jon:  A good move, now the white stone at A is settled and black has two separate weak groups.]
;B[cq]LB[fq:A]TR[om][op]C[bad again?!

Jon:   Locally, black has no choice but to take the corner, he can't afford to run away with the stone at A.  In terms of the overall picture though, the result will be bad for black.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]TR[om][op]C[Jon:  Black established himself safely in the bottom left corner, but the left side is now flat and white was given a nice amount of territory on the bottom.  Also note that black's two marked stones are still unsettled and vulnerable to attack.]
;W[mm];B[qq]LB[nl:A]C[Jon:  Because black still has an escape route, it's better to run away with the kosumi at A than try to live small unless you absolutely have to.]
;W[rq]LB[nl:A]C[The game looked so bad, so a tried to pick a fight, but that backfired. Wat is b sopposed to do here?

Jon:  Picking a fight is reasonable, but not just yet since you still have the escape route.  I'd move out with the kosumi at A first to get out of the bottom right, then you can worry about white's developing framework on the bottom.]
;B[qn]LB[qq:1][rq:2]C[Jon:  Locally, this isn't a bad idea, but if you want to play this, it would be better to omit the 1-2 exchange and play this right away since that exchange helped white strengthen.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[po];B[rp];W[pp];B[rr];W[pq]
(;B[sq]LB[qr:A]C[Jon:  I'd prefer to connect at A, as taking the stone right away allows white to cover up that hole by making the atari at A himself.]
;W[qr]
(;B[rq];W[pr];B[rm];W[rl];B[ql];W[pm];B[rn]C[I missed, that b is not even alive after s9 here.

Jon:  It's not *too* big a problem for black, but white S-9 will allow white to get some territory with an extension to R-13 after black fixes his weakness.]
;W[em]C[Jon:  This is a critical point for both sides.  White is now expanding his framework while pressing black's left side down, so it's a good move, but it makes things tough for black.]

(;B[cm]C[Jon:  Because white's framework is getting pretty big, I don't think black has the time to defend here, so he must work on something else instead.

What's a more important area for black to work on?]
(;W[im]C[Jon:  A horribly passive move.  White shouldn't try to tightly secure the territory in his framework yet.  Placing stones inside it unnecessarily limits its potential for expansion considerably, but because the framework still isn't totally secure with one move alone, this stone is very awkwardly placed.

What's a better way for white to build his framework on the bottom?]
;B[gm]LB[ie:A]TR[fc][ic][ed][fd]C[Jon:  This reduction has the right idea, but it's a bit early (and deep).  I'd like to attack the marked white stones on the top with A first to build a little more strength before doing it.]
;W[gn];B[fn]
(;W[go]C[Jon:  Allowing black to connect is very passive, white must follow through and cut the black stones apart.]
;B[fm];W[fp]LB[fo:A]C[Jon:  Defending this way is kind of awkward in terms of shape, so I'd prefer to turn more simply with A.]
;B[el]C[Jon:  Good!  Black is starting to build a nice amount of potential territory on the left side.]
;W[dg]LB[eg:A]TR[fc][ic][ed][fd]C[Jon:  Pressing down here has the right idea, but because white's marked stones aren't stable yet, white can't afford to play a longer (thinner) move like this.  It'd be much safer to jump down more carefully with a two point jump at A.]
;B[df]C[Jon:  Good!  Black must take advantage of the thin connectivity and separate white's stones.]
;W[dl];B[en];W[cl]LB[ef:A][ek:B]C[Jon:  White's playing too risky here by starting a second separate group.  He should worry about his top group first and hane at A.

Locally, it'd be better for white to counteratari at B, which will give him better access to the center.]
;B[ek];W[dj]
(;B[km]C[Jon:  Too early!  Black doesn't have the strength to start another reduction yet, so he should work on something else first.  

What should black work on instead?]
(;W[rk]LB[qk:A][km:B]C[Jon:  It's too early to make this exchange since black has the refutation at A.  So white should worry about attacking the stone at B.

What's the best way for white to attack the stone at B?];B[qk]
;W[qj]
(;B[kp]LB[km:A]C[Jon:  Because black's stone at A above isn't stable yet, digging deeper into the bottom is too dangerous, you have to strengthen the stone at A first.

What's a good way to strengthen the stone at A?];W[ko];B[lo]
;W[jo];B[mp];W[lq];B[ln];W[lm]
(;B[kn]LB[kl:A]C[Jon:  Because black can't escape, it's better to save what you can by pushing out with A and giving up the bottom stones.]
;W[kl];B[mq];W[lr];B[jl];W[jm]
(;B[ll]LB[kk:A]TR[km][kn][ln][lo][mp][op][mq]C[Jon:  Trying to cut is a bit of an overplay, so it's better to atari from the other side (at A).  It's very hard to save the marked black stones anyway, but by forcing white to extend to A, white is gaining more strength in the center, which will make it slightly easier for his weak groups to escape.

Please skip to move 117 for the final comments and closing summary.]

[om][on]C[this move is clearly a miss. I thought it is sente against the s8 group, bu this one can defend in sente.

here my question: is there any way black can still continue the game and get chances if he plays something else than o8 or is the game lost anyway?

Thanks for  analysing.

Jon:  Yeah, the white S-8 group won't have any trouble defending.  As for your question, I would still continue the game if I were black.  The position isn't great, black's behind by roughly 10-15 points, but he has one last chance to turn it around, and that lies in attacking the three marked white groups. None of these groups are in great shape, so that's where your opportunity lies.  The only thing you have to watch out for is the marked black stones in the center.  They're not totally settled yet, so you'd have to be careful not to let them fall into any danger during the attack.  Instead of O-8, I would start the attack by making the hane at E-13 (A).  Putting pressure on the left side group will isolate it from the top group while reaching out to the marked black stones in the center.  

Here are the most important points for this game:

Opening:

1.)  When approaching a corner that has extra stones nearby it, more aggressive approaches like the small knight's approach or one point approach may be too dangerous to use.  This is when more gentle approaches like the large knight's approach are useful, as they're harder to pincer/attack and will have an easier time making a base or escaping if they need to.

2.)  Moves 19 (black F-3) and white's response at move 20 (white J-3) played a critical part in the opening.  These kinds of situations come up a lot where an approach move may allow a weak enemy stone further down the side to establish itself while pincering that approach move.  If possible, you want to avoid giving your opponent an opportunity to settle like this and prevent it from happening altogether, whether by pincering the enemy stone directly or some other way.

Midgame:

1.)  You prepared the attack on white's two weak groups (top and left side) nicely, but these attacking opportunities were damaged by the overaggressive reduction at move 67 (black L-7).  Before making a reduction/invasion, make sure that you not only have the strength to safely do it, but also make sure it won't damage your other stones on the board or help your opponent's weak stones.  The same applies for when you're considering digging deeper into an area (e.g. black L-4 at move 71).  Before you do it, make sure you can get out safely.

Thank you very much for allowing me to review your game!  I hope you found my commentary helpful, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

(;B[nq]LB[pj:A]C[Maybe this?

(;W[dd]LB[fc:A][ic:B]C[Jon:  Since the hane at A leaves white's stones smushed together and pressured, white should consider a different direction altogether.

This would be a lot more playable, but white also has the stone at B for a little extra support if he needs it.]
