AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hello and thank you so much for reviewing my game.  I made all of these comments right after the game while my thoughts were still fresh.  I played this game in an online tournament and I havn't played in a while.  This was just and attempt to win a couple of books for my club.  Anyway, I was winning through most of the game and then when my opponent brought a group back to life that I thought that I had killed then I lost my cool and stopped playing my A-game. After you look at the game, can you give me a rough estimation on what you think my rank is so when I play against people, I can play people who I would learn from but still have a chance of winning.

p.s.  When you make you comments, can you put you initials in front of then to differentiate your comments from my comments?

Hi. I'll prefix my comments with "C:"
I am a 2k player, so I'll try and give you some insight into your opponent's strategy and what you should be trying to do.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[pm];B[mq];W[lc]C[I didn't know what to do here, so I kicked here..

C: The correct move here is Q10];B[qe];W[pf]C[C: I'm not convinced that that exchange was good for you. You've strengthened white, which makes your proposed pincer weaker, and of course, your corner is now more fragile.]
;B[qj]C[I think that this was a good move because of the fact that it pincers the Q7 stone AND it denies white his precious 3 space extension.

C: The idea is fine, but as discussed, it should probably have been done before the R15/Q14 exchange. And the orthodox move here is on the 4th line.]
;W[oc];B[pc]C[Should I have blocked at P16 and then build up some power to attack his two base-less stones at R14?

C: In a 3+ handicap game, you really, really want your stones to work together, so to get isolated in the corner would be a terrible result. In fact, if white goes and creates a group in the corner, you would be delighted. So yes, definitely, connect your stones!]
;W[od];B[oe];W[nc];B[md];W[pe];B[mc];W[mb];B[lb];W[nb];B[kc]
;W[ld];B[le];W[ne];B[me];W[of]C[I feel that I let white get too much by playing out this sequence because I let him get a beautiful Ponnuki in the center, and I know the proverb about ponnuki in the center.  To make it even worse, My corner is mostlikly going to die.  I got robbed!

C: White has reduced the game to a 4 stone handicap game (perhaps even less). I don't know about robbed - if you get involved in complex reading fights, especially so early in the game, this kind of thing can be expected. Rather play simply, keep your stones connected and attack white on a large scale. Now is not the time to think about territory. That will come later.]
;B[ok]C[I think this was a weak attack on the Q7 stone.  I think it would be better to play R5 if I was going to attack or I might consider tenuki.

C: It's the right idea. Attack white on a large scale. I think P10 may have been less complicated.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[rq];W[oo];B[op];W[no];B[dj]C[I think this was a pretty good move because it helps out my moyo strategy and I should (but didn't) make a lot of territory.

C: Excellent.];W[dm];B[gq]C[C: I'm not overly fond of the large knight's move from the 4-4 stone. It feels too easy for white. F4 feels like the right move in this situation.]
;W[cq]C[I think this was bad for white because he was helping me with my moyo strategy by invading at the 3-3.  Should I have kept the corner?

C: I don't think white had much choice. Perhaps he could have attached at C4 to keep it complicated.]
;B[cp]C[C: Good];W[dq];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co]
;W[fr]C[Now I think this is my first major mistake (see next move).  I should have tenukied right here by either attacking the not yet stable R5 group or enclosing the upper left.  Can you show me how I coud harass the R5 group  and gain a wall or territory?

C: O7 is the vital point];B[gr]C[This was bad of me.  in the game, I didn't even make any territory in this area and white somewhat fortified his R5 group too.

C: It's not a great move, but has the merit of 100% confining white to the corner. O7 is interesting, or anything which seeks to capture D7 on a large scale. K4, G7 something like that.]
;W[nl];B[mk]C[C: I don't understand this move. You surely have to play at O9?]
;W[nk]C[Here I can tell that white didn't bother to read this sequence out.]
;B[nj];W[oj]C[C: White has cut on the wrong side.];B[oi];W[pj]
;B[pk]C[See what I mean...

C: A nice result, but Q10 has aji for white. You should seek to capture the stones the first chance you get. (The same applies to M16)]
;W[jp]C[Here, I didn't know what to do.  Should I have plyed J5 to help my moyo strategy or build up some power to attack the stone at K4 (which I tried to do)?

C: K4 feels like an overplay from white and it seems like you should try and cut it off. M5 might work, but the bad aji left by the Q10 stones makes a fight really difficult. See variation for one possible result. M4 is probably your best bet. However, your suggestion of J5 is also viable.]

(;B[mo]C[C: Attaching often works to strengthn your stones, but not in this case.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[mp];B[lp];W[lo];B[mn]C[C: This feels like trying to have your cake and eat it too. I don't think your stones are strong enough to attack both groups at the same time.]
;W[ln];B[mm];W[mj];B[ni];W[ml];B[po];W[on];B[pn];W[om];B[lm]
;W[km];B[kp];W[jo];B[kn];W[ko];B[ll];W[lk];B[kl];W[jm];B[kk]
C[Was this move really necessary?  Maybe it is just me Half reading, but I think without this move white could have seperated me.

C: I think it was essential.];W[jq];B[kr];W[jr];B[kq];W[rm]
;B[in]C[Was this a good attack?  I wanted to attack and try and kill his group but even if I didn't (and I didn't), I would still surround the D7 group and make some territory.

C: It's probably the best way and best timing to get something out of L6]
;W[jn];B[gm]C[C: G6 is the usual move if you want to rescue the peeping stone.]
;W[hm];B[hn];W[im];B[fn];W[mi];B[ql];W[nh];B[ph]C[This move was stupid.  It was one of the worst moves I made. I should have continued to attack that K7 group and or played R7 and followed that sequence.

C: B or Q11 are miai, so you are right, you could have ignored O12. BTW, Q11 is better than Q12. Just capture the stones. While they are on the board, they have aji. Get rid of them.]
;W[hk]C[Now white has better chances of living.

C: It's fine if white lives, so long as you can take territory from attacking it. The problem is your weak stones in the middle.]
;B[fk];W[fj]
(;B[ek]C[C: Too soft. G9 or G10 is essential here. You're very strong locally.]
;W[gj];B[jh];W[jf];B[je]C[This move should have been at K16 shouldn't it?

C: I prefer to capture! L14 might work too.];W[kf]C[Now I can't connect to my N15 group and if white wanted to, he could just detroy my positon up there.]
;B[hi]C[I think this was a good move because it took away some of white's shape and made me some too.  What do you think.

C: It's a key shape point, yes];W[gh];B[hh];W[gg];B[lj]C[C: I don't understand this move. How about J14?]
;W[oh]C[This is kind of when thinks started to go down hill from here. I didn't want my M7 group to die so I sacraficed my Q9 group. Was this right?  Was there a way that both groups could have lived?

C: Probably, especially as you already pointed out R7.];B[li]
;W[lh];B[ki];W[pi];B[qi]C[This would have been better at R7.]
;W[qm]C[And now it dies a meaningless death and it didn't die for a good cause.]
;B[ik];W[go];B[gn];W[hl]C[Here I think this was a mistake by white.  If he had played J8, I think it would have been a little bit better.]
;B[hj];W[gk];B[gi];W[fi]
(;B[fh]C[C: This is now an all or nothing fight. I prefer the peep at E12 - take territory while attacking. And white will still be searching for the 2nd eye. Even with the disasters which have occurred on the right, you're only about 20 points behind. If you can nail some territory on the left and the top, you could still win.]
;W[di];B[eh];W[ei];B[ef]C[Was this the correct move?];W[ff]
;B[dh];W[ch];B[cg];W[ci]C[Why didn't white play at C10?];B[cj]
;W[df];B[dg];W[cf];B[bf];W[ee];B[bh];W[bi];B[be];W[ah];B[bg]
;W[bk];B[bj];W[aj]C[Here I half read because I was at the lobrary and I only have a few minutes left before I automatically got logged out.  I started to play my instinctive play of C8 but paniced because of my time factor.

C: B8 might work, but its tricky. It could easily go wrong.]

(;B[fl];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl];B[am];W[an];B[ao]C[After I had discovered he made life, something inside of me made me lose hope and my playing just fell apart.  Most of the moves I made after this was not the way I usually play.  I am not pround of most of my play after this.  I lsot control of my emotions and my play fell apart.  END OF MY COMMENTS

p.s.  So how do you think I did?  Did I make my explainations clear enough for you?  I tried to make it feel as if I was right there reviewing with you so that you can understand my way of thinking and why I made some of the moves I did.  Also, don't forget about the little rank estimation for me.  You have to be dead on about it too, I just want an estimation.  Can you also tell me what I should study to improve?

Thank you for this review.  I am very thankful!! :)

C: Thanks for the game, it was interesting. I think you may perhaps be around 6k, but its hard to estimate from a high handicap game. Your reading is pretty good, and your studious attitude to the game shows you will improve quickly. If you play more of these 5 stones games, just remember to try and stay thick and connected, focus on central strength, attack on a large scale, and the territory will come naturally.]
