C[N: Hi I play as Numsgil (3k) on KGS.  I've prefixed my comments with N: There weren't any grand errors, but you need to be concious of keeping your enemy groups separated and weak, and your own groups connected and strong.]
;B[pd]C[berbun [9k\]: guten miiag];W[dc];B[pp]C[Stevey [10k\]: gg]
;W[cp];B[mq]C[N: Normally you should consider approaching one of the 3-4 stones first, as 4-4 stones are a bit more robust (white can approach them and you can actually tenuki).  But this isn't necessarily bad.]
;W[np]C[N: White would be better served finishing one of his 3-4 corners.   If white insists on approaching a black corner, the top would be the better choice.  This is playing near strength, which is bad.]
;B[nq]C[N: Good, you should respond.  This exchange favors black.

berbun [9k\]: same 2 u];W[nn]C[N: White is playing light, but black doesn't have to respond.  It's not clear that white has used his sente well at all.]
;B[iq]TR[jq]CR[ip]MA[pn]SQ[eq][ep]C[N: This isn't a good move.  It keeps you low on the side, and the connection to your other stones isn't very strong.

If you want to emphasize territory, play the solid move at triangle.  This isn't a very big move, though.

If you want to emphasize development (ie: a moyo), you should play circle.  This makes a light and flexible shape (if white invades, you can just continue to extend along the bottom.

Either square would be better than either circle or triangle, though.  Your corner is safe, so you can afford to take a big move, and approaching a 3-4 stone is very big indeed.  You don't have to worry about a pincer because your solid stones to the right will mean a white pincer stone will be uncomfortable.

The play at X is another possibility, as it attacks white's two stones while grabbing profit.  I think Square would be bigger, though.]
;W[rp]MA[qq]CR[qo]SQ[pn]C[N: These sorts of moves rely on confusion.  Keep a clear goal in your mind of what you want to achieve and what you're willing to give up, and you should be able to make your opponent punish himself.

Here, white already has a weak group, so white's new weak group here is a huge problem.  Don't allow white to connect his two groups.

Square would be a reasonable move that splits white's two groups.  Whichever group he neglects to respond with will then come under extreme attack.

Circle is another idea that places move pressure on white's single stone.  However, you should usually put more pressure on the larger group, which would make square the better move IMO.

X would protect corner territroy, but also allow white to connect his stones, which seems intolerable.]
;B[qq];W[rq]MA[po]C[N: I think white should look to connect his stones instead and build thickness.  Cross would seem to do that.]
;B[rr]MA[qo]SQ[pn]C[N: No, you shouldn't care about such small territory.

Push him along the second line with X or attack the two floating stones with square.]
;W[po]C[N: Yes, but white should have done this directly without that last exchange.]
;B[op];W[oo];B[qp];W[qo];B[qg]C[N: Good.  This is the biggest side now (white has a wall and he wants/needs to make it useful).  Closer to white's wall would be too thin.]
;W[qk]CR[qi]SQ[qh]C[N: White should extend to circle.  White actually wants to extend to square, but black got there first.

As it is this is really over concentrated for white.];B[cj]
SQ[eq][ce][de][jc]C[N: There are bigger moves at any of squares.]
;W[ok]C[N: White is playing too slowly here.  He needs to take a big point elsewhere.]
;B[eq]C[N: Good.];W[dq]TR[iq]C[N: This is good for black, because after black extends the triangled stone becomes ideally placed.]
;B[ep];W[gq]C[N: White is being unreasonable.];B[hr]TR[hp]SQ[go]
C[N: No.  Triangle is normal.  Then if white extends, you play square and lock him in.]
;W[gr]TR[er]C[N: Now you need a move at triangle or white will connect under.

Which means this exchange was gote for you.  Which is why it's bad.]
;B[en];W[er];B[cn]TR[co]C[N: Play tight at triangle.  White is already strong, so you're allowed to play tight.]
;W[cr];B[jc]TR[de][ce]C[N:  Good.  It's debatable to me whether triangle is bigger, though.]
;W[gc];B[mc]TR[nc]C[N: This leaves the corner open, though.  In cases like this you might considertriangle.  It allows white to try and invade later, but it protects the corner, which is bigger.]
;W[qc];B[qd]TR[pc]C[N: This is the wrong direction.  Build you wall facing the larger side.  Which is the top side in this case.  So triangle is appropriate.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc]TR[nb]C[N: Triangle is normal.  You don't need to be afraid.  White will live bigger if you play this way.]
;W[nb];B[mb]TR[rc]C[N: Triangle is better.  White doesn't want to crawl along the second line anyway, so there's not much need to close him in.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[of]SQ[rf]TR[pf]C[N: This leaves a lot of aji behind (for instance, the clamp at square).  Triangle would be better.]
;W[cl];B[cg]TR[dk]C[N: Punish white and try to enclose him at triangle.  If white' stone escapes, your bottom stones are floating and come under attack.]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[gm];B[go];W[hp];B[ip]C[N: This just forces white to damage your weak group.]
;W[ho]C[N: White hurts your group.];B[gn];W[hn];B[em];W[el]
;B[fl];W[ek];B[fm];W[hm];B[gk];W[fj];B[cd]C[N: You still have a weak group you need to run with.  You don't have time for this.]
;W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[hb];W[ee];B[de];W[ef];B[df];W[dd];B[ce]
;W[gb];B[ge];W[gd];B[he]C[N: You end in gote.  White could continue to attack your weak group on the bottom left.]

C[N: You're forcing white to hurt your other group (which is bad).]
;W[jf];B[je];W[if];B[ie];W[hg]C[N: Your other gorup is in trouble now, because it's closed off.]

;B[bo];W[dp];B[do];W[fp];B[fo];W[fq];B[eo]C[N: You don't need to respond like this right away.  It's worth about 2 points in reverse sente (if white captures, you just capture white right back).  There are bigger moves on the board.]
;W[hq];B[ir];W[hs];B[is];W[gs];B[ko];W[mo];B[in]C[N: This is like passing: 0 points in gote.]
