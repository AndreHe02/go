C[Dear Tibor,

the game became difficult after your group in the upper left became heavy and White got huge profit while attacking this group.
The major mistakes were E12, D15 and F15. Study the joseki and try
to understand the meaning of each move! If you have got Kageyamas "Lessons in
the Fundamentals of Go" (a really excellent book), reread the chapter on "the
stones go walking". Remember the proverb "you can't catch up if you are pushing
from behind"!

One final remark: If a big group of you is cut off, try to live; if you fail to
live, resign. There was no point in continuing the game after your group on the
lower side died!

Kind regards,
Christian Gawron]

See Ishida Yoshio, "Dictionary of Basic Joseki", Vol. 1, page 27 for a discussion of the joseki and the chapter "the stones go walking"  of Kageyamas "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" for a general discussion of running battles.]
;W[cd];B[bd]TR[ch][eh][dg][eg]C[Just descending at B15 is better. Without the marked stones exchanged, this would be a reasonable move because after W B17, B D16, W C17 B lack can immobilize the W stone with D13, but now B only strengthens W's corner.]

(;B[de]C[Very bad. Since B plans to eliminate the aji of E14 by exchanging F15 for G16, he should do so right now.]
;W[cj];B[fe]TR[eg][dh][eh]C[Pushing from behind is bad. Since W has already played at C10, B doesn't get any compensation for W G16.  Furthermore E14 is not an immeadeate thread in this position because even if the ladder wouldn't work B can simply sacrifice the marked three stones and get a strong position at the top.]
