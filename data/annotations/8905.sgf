C[Hello, my name is Ashish and I am your reviewer.  I used to play online on KGS, but rarely do nowadays so if you have any questions, feel free to email me at ashrestha1994@gmail.com.  From here on in, I'll begin all of my comments with a / so that you know it is my comment, not yours.]
;B[pd];W[pq]MA[nc][qf]CR[po][qo]C[It's a mistake for white, isn't it? Or this fuseki is just fine?

/Its a different fuseki.  Essentially, white is threatening to enclose that corner in the future.  It is easier to close than the normal 4-4 (the 4-4 requires two stones at the crosses), but is also easier to approach and threaten (with R5 or Q5, the circles).]
;B[dd];W[cp];B[po]CR[pj][pk][qj][qk]C[/Good choice to approach, but do keep in mind that approaching high at Q5 requires you have or shortly gain some strength in the circled R9 area]
;W[qo];B[qn];W[ro];B[pm];W[pp];B[pi];W[jp];B[dn]C[/Approaching from this side doesn't really get Black much without something around C10 on the left.  Perhaps seek to enclose the top at K17 instead, or strengthen the right.  If you want to be very aggressive, E3 is not unreasonable.]
;W[ep];B[fn]C[/This jump gets Black very little, and gives your opponent very much.  He can now extend an already dense bottom, whereas you are not actually gaining territory without a stone in the D10 area.]
(;W[hn];B[gp];W[gq];B[fp];W[fq];B[eo];W[dp];B[di]C[I tried to play agressively

/This isn't really aggressive, and its very smart.  Perhaps should have been played earlier.  Do note that white C4 means you are still vulnerable and a reduction is very easy.]
;W[hp]C[/Questionable move, as there are much larger places on the board for white to play.  Primarily, consider the top.]
(;B[gn]C[/This gets you very little.  Could play elsewhere (top, strengthen either left or right at C6 or S6 respectively).]
;W[go];B[fo];W[ho];B[jd];W[jc]C[How to answer this invasion? My opponent did this THREE times a game! And I didn't catch with that.

/If by "answer" you mean "kill", I don't know that it is easy or even possible assuming perfect play.  The possibilities are huge.  I've played out some possibilities as alternate paths, but the real "answer" is to accept it and use it to strengthen yourself.]

(;B[ob];W[pb];B[mb];W[oa];B[md];W[kb];B[lb];W[ka];B[oo]C[/In the right direction, but Black is still weak at S6.  Also, its probably not a great idea to threaten to use your framework across the board; there's just a lot of possibilities for reduction.  Perhaps start with something more managable, like playing around the center of the board so you can defend either the center-left or center-right.  If you want to play like this (which is perfectly reasonable) just don't be overly aggressive and try to keep every point.  Doing this gives you a large advantange, which you don't want to lose because you got into a fight over a small number of points which spilled over into the rest of your territory.]

C[/This is the type of thing I'm talking about.  Its reasonably safe in this case, but before you make a move that makes your position potentially very weak, like the double hane, count the score and make sure the points you lose by not playing the double-hane are on the order of magnitude that they could affect the outcome of the game.  Don't put yourself in a bad position so that you can keep 10 points if you are up by 40.]

/This game isn't actually decided yet.  Its something like 75-55 white (I don't have a score estimator on the SGF editor I'm using, so I'm just estimating score).  Your center area is much larger than you realize. However, you end up getting reduced pretty badly.]

/Yeah, overall Black's opening was solid but you weren't very good at responding to his invasions.  You definitely know how to get framework, which is admirable and something a lot of people aren't aware of.  However, you need to learn to keep that framework alive, often times (ironically) by granting some of it away.  What I like to do, as I am a lot like you in those respects, is right after the fuseki, spend a minute or two and just count the points.  That way, I have a vague idea of how I am faring, and if I am up in points, by how much.  From there onwards, I can more accurately decide if I want to take a risk by playing a weak but aggressive stone.  Every once in a while, especially after big fights, recalculate the score.  If you're up by a lot, play more defensively.  If you're down, take more risks.


White only wins this game because Black does not know how to properly defend against the single invasion continually used in this game.  Without properly building up a larger framework, and with a continuous decision to give black large amounts of influence, White can easily lose because his fuseki does not grant enough of a framework to work with.  Consider making larger plays at the start, like taking more sides of the board.  Also, perhaps reconsider the 3-4 opening as white; playing second opens you up to an easy reduction of the corner.]

(;B[bk]CR[bd][cd]C[/Here you'll notice that he is less (although still very) threatened.  This move depends upon your ability to close off eyespace on the other side, which isn't immediately provided by your position, because you don't have stones in the circled areas.  However, it is still very threatening.]
