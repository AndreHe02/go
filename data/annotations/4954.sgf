C[Dear reviewer,

Thanks for taking the time to review my game.
My main weakness lies in dealing with moyo.
I have read a number of books, one of which includes reducing territorial frameworks, but alas, I still find myself getting in too deep and losing myself.
I am stuck with many a question, first of which is my choice of reducing move. I am very curious as to have your opinion on whether or not I should have even let it get to that point to begin with.

My opponent made a few comments to me after game that shed a little light on my game, and I found them very helpful. That is why I hope you might point out a few things for him to work on too.

I am white, my opponent is black. He played very hard, and because of it, I had no chance. I very much appreciate any guidance you can offer. I am tired of fluctuating between 5k and 6k, and so I say, I must fix this! :)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[pj]LB[nq:A][jq:B]C[White can choose to play A or B also.]
;W[cn];B[dn]C[Here I am forced to make a choice. Black plays a joseki that many pros dislike. I like it, for black, because it really builds up his moyo potential on the lower side more than anything else. What do I do as white about this?? My opponent suggested a double approach at f3. What do you think?

Without a black stone around K4, black D6 is considered as bad choice.]

(;W[do];B[eo];W[co];B[ep];W[cp];B[cq]
(;W[bq];B[cr]C[My opponent suggested E6 (or at least placed it on the board), but I can't see what to do after b plays D7. I don't believe this to be a rational way to play.

Possible I think, but the line can be complicated.]
(;W[dm];B[en]LB[cl:A]C[White A is shape.];W[cj];B[em];W[dl]
LB[ci:A][cl:B]C[C10 look better if placed at A.

So in the first place, C10 should be played at B.];B[jp]C[My opponent suggested K16, but after black f9 his moyo hurts my head and I don't want to go in there...except maybe r3 invasion. IF I was to make a reducing move as shown in the variation...what can I expect? Are either of the two variations good? Is Black f9 a good move?

Regardless...F9 seems like a very silly move for W now. It seems like W K16 is a must.]

(;W[fk]LB[jd:A]C[If there is a white stone at A, F9 is a good move, cos you have an equally big moyo.

I suggest invasion at M3...

Or you can play K16... Let black F9 then you play M3.];B[fc]

(;W[de];B[cf];W[qq]LB[lq:A]C[I have a feeling this move was a huge mistake. allowing b to build even more thickness...perhaps this is what B hopes for when he plays this fuseki?

(;W[pr]C[Wrong order again.];B[or];W[qr];B[nq];W[rn]LB[ql:A]
C[Now, you give black the choice to tenuki or play A.

When you push first, black has no other choice but to extend at R7.]
;B[qm];W[ch]LB[kl:A][km:B]C[now that I see how little it affects black, this seems silly.

Either white A or B for me, you have to restrict the moyo *now*.]
;B[df];W[fd]LB[jj:A]C[Somehow, I think the tengen is urgent for black now.]
;B[ef];W[be];B[ce];W[bf];B[bd];W[cg]LB[ab:A]C[Anytime (when black is sealed up), black can play A for 2 eyes.

So black should tenuki and play the tengen.];B[ge];W[gd];B[hd]

Thank you again for the review!];B[fh]C[Oh well, black did everything right here.

I will end the review here.

Overall, you did very well except for some unpolished, small mistakes.

Study more pro games, look closely at the details, especially on shape.

Hope this like this review.

Thank you.

If black A then you play B to split the moyo.
