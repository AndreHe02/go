;W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj];W[cl]L[nq][fq][dq][iq]M[dp]N[Beginning of the end]
C[At this  stage I would have played at "a". The move at C8 is not only a bit aggressive  against a strong position but also too small for the beginning. A move at "a"  would work nicely with the marked stone. Furthermore, when Black plays at  "b", White feels compelled to respond at "c", thus allowing Black to play the  excellent move at "d".  The more I analyzed your game the more I came to feel  that not playing at "a" was the beginning of your undoing.]
;B[fq]M[pp]C[Black is developing nicely, his kakari stone is working nicely with his  marked stone.]
;W[dq];B[iq]C[Blacks's overall position looks good. White  needed to play on Black's side of the board sooner.]
;W[qf]L[qn][qk]N[Wrong direction?]C[In this position I would have played at "a", mostly  because a Black response around "b" would still leave the lone Black stone at  the top still vulnerable for a subsequent White attack.]
;B[qh]M[pp]C[This  is a good move by Black. By playing the tight pincer,  he's inviting you to  play in the corner, and his pincer stone is working well with his marked  stone in the lower corner. With this move, Black is threatening to build up  the lower side of the board. Therefore, you might want to consider Var 2.]

C[At  this point Black has enormous influence with  potential to grow, whereas  White has secure territory but limited potential to grow. Since White has  sente, his next move is important.]
;W[qn]C[I can understand your desire to  stirke deeply in Black's sphere of influence, however, in this situation,  White will simply become a target, and Black, while attacking,  will acquire  secure territory; this is where his influence will pay off. I have to admit  that in this situation, it's hard to think of a good move for White, so  overwhelming is Black's position.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[ql];W[pl];B[qk];W[pk];B[pj];W[mm];B[np];W[oj];B[pi];W[mj]
;B[om];W[pm];B[nm];W[nl];B[no];W[ol];B[oo]L[lq]C[If I had been Black, I would have played at "a".]
;W[dh]L[bj][ci][el]C[This is another example of being overly aggrressive. A  better sequence for you in this local situation might have been "a", Black  responds at "b", followed by White "c".]
;B[ch];W[ci];B[di];W[cj];B[eh];W[bh];B[cg];W[qq]L[lq]C[There is certainly room for invading the lower side,  but not where Black is very strong. Not every 3-3 point is invadeable. I  would have considered "a" first, as it would afford more potetial either to  live or escape.]
;B[rp];W[pr];B[rr];W[mq]C[This is a good move.];B[nq];W[nr];B[lr];W[mr]
M[fq][iq]L[lq][kr]C[Instead of connecting right away, you  might have extended to "a" first. If Black cuts, then you could play at "b",  this would have the effect of separating the two marked stones.]
;B[kr];W[pq];B[rq];W[lp];B[ln];W[ip]L[jp]C[This is too far. Playing at "a" would  have been better. Of course, playing at "a" still leaves the white group an  object of attack.]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[lo];W[kq];B[lq];W[jp];B[mp];W[jr];B[jq];W[ir]L[hq][hr]
[gp]C[Instead of playing here, perhaps you could have  played at "a" and "b", followed by "c"]
;B[kp];W[hq];B[fo];W[kq]C[You should save such moves for ko fights.];B[jq]
;W[fm]C[This  is a good attacking move; unfortunately, your surrounding stones are not very  strong.]
;B[em];W[fn];B[eo];W[en];B[do];W[co];B[cn]M[do][eo][fo][fq]L[dn]N[Start a fight.]
C[At this point, White must be willing to fight  by cutting Black at "a". The Variations below show 3 possible outcomes. Any  one of these would have given you a strong attack on the marked stones.]

(;W[bo];B[dn];W[dm];B[el];W[hn];B[bm]L[bk][bl]C[White plays at "a", which  is a mistake; he should play at "b" if he wants to live (see Var 2).]

(;W[bk];B[bl];W[ck];B[bg];W[cm];B[bn];W[ek];B[dk]L[fl][dl]N[Start a fight.]
C[On the next  move White will play at "a", you should have played at "b" as Var 2 will  show.]

(;W[fl];B[dl];W[km];B[kc];W[ld];B[kd];W[ke]C[This is a good move, as it  starts a fight. The importance of starting fights is because White is   behind, and he must be more aggressive if he wants to recover lost ground.]
