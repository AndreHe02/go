;B[eg];W[dg]LB[ef:a][ff:b][fg:c]C[I felt there had to be a way to punish B here but couldn't find it.  His leaning attack just caused too much strength.

Its a difficult situation for me to evaluate and impossible for me to say whether the abc-cut would be better.
some general notions: white has about 20 points on the left side, 10 points at the bottom, 15 points in the middle left, 5 points at the top and 5 points komi = about 55 points
black has 5 points bottom left and the big right side:  this are perhaps over 50 points, but white has more potential: for example the weak black upper left group, so to my opinion if white plays a good endgame, white has a slight lead, so your move seems to me allright.]
