AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Dear Reviewer,

First, thanks for taking the time to go over this game :)

I played White in this one, and I am well aware that I only won because of Black's mistake in counting liberties.

Please if you would to indicate where I, or Black (as it is another member of my go-club) could use improvements. I have only made a few questions at certain points. I hope you can give suggestions for better moves :)

exswoo[5k\]-Hi.  I'll be reviewing your game this time around.  Please be warned that I'm no expert when it comes to high handicap games myself, so a lot of the stuff I'll be commenting on will be my gut feeling.]
PL[B];W[cf];B[fc];W[ci];B[cn]C[Taking territory in a handicap game is not fast enough I take it?

-Well, not territory per se, but having a base to work with is always one of the main priorities  in handicap games, so this is fine by me.]
;W[nq];B[jq];W[qn];B[jo]LB[oo:A]C[-A is bigger than anything else at this point.]

(;W[qk]LB[oo:A]C[-Again, A is the biggest point left.];B[nc]
;W[kp]LB[no:B][oo:A][gp:C]C[-bad peep.  You only help B here.

You basically have choices here. A or B (reccomended) to trap the corner B stone and keep O-3 stone out of trouble,or you can barge in with C to try to split B up.

C is something you shouldn't do normally, but it is a high handicap game so you don't have much choice in the matter.]
;B[jp];W[gm]LB[jc:A][gp:B]C[I was unsure of this move.

-I would go deeper in to B if I wanted to put pressure.  A is also a prime spot.]

;B[kq];W[lj]C[-questionable play by W here, in my opinion, althought it might be warrented in a handicap game.]

;B[ac]C[Thanks again for reviewing the game!

-Some final comments:

Well, this was a game that was clearly going in B's favor until he misread the board, so it's hard to comment on the places where B didn't play well since he was doing well enough to win.

However,  I noticed that both players need some more work on the ooyose.  There were a lot of moves made around moves 150 onwards that didn't accomplish much in the way of gaining or taking away points.  It's things like that that add up near the end (you can lose/gain up to 20 points easy in the endgame) so it's something that I think you should study when you can.

Still, it was quite an interesting game.  Wish you luck in your future games! :)]
