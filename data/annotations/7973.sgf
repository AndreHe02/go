C[I played this game on KGS with B(12k) against
a 11k player. 20 minutes plus 5 byo-yomi 30s.

elvard:
Hi there,
I'm Tomas Ehrlich from Czech Republic and I'm very glad, I can review your game, as it is my first review for GTL.


1. Think about value of your moves. Think, what will happen, if you don't defend and take sente somewhere else instead. But also, defend where you have to. Usually, preventing capture stones, which are not important, is bad.

2. Don't be so kind on your oponent. Don't give him, what he wants. 

3. Solve Life&Death tsumegos, it gives you good idea, which group is alive and which not. Cho Chikun has nice Encyclopedia of L&D collection, good point to start. Also, it improves your reading skill, which is very important for every go player.]

If you want to play B, 1-2 exchange is bad for black, since B is now gote. Black has to defend at C, but it's white's turn, so invasion is inevitable]
(;W[oc]C[Here I thought P16 to block on the wider side, if W answers with Q17, B can still play R17 to make a base.

elvard: strange move.

P16 is possible, but Q17 looks good too, since black will take huge and secure corner.

In this possition, don't think about making base. You have locally one more stone, so you have advantage. Since black has to handle his p17 stone somehow, you are safe.]
;B[od];W[nd]C[elvard: now, Q17 looks very nice]

;W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb]LB[pg:A][ph:B]C[elvard: Now, A is too close to black's wall, it should be at B]

;B[ng]LB[fc:A][ng:B]C[I did this move to build a large mojo and expand influence.

elvard: Possible, I would rather consider A, since B is just building passively moyo. Anyway,  with white stone somewhere around J17 it would be nice move, since it's a pivot point for both, black and white, moyos, see variation]
(;W[cg]
(;B[fc]C[elvard: you should consider cut at O17 first, since white didn't defend it]
;W[cb]LB[db:B][dc:A]C[elvard: huh, interesting. White should consider A, it's more solid, or B.]
;B[ic];W[kc]C[elvard: Now, cut at o17 is protected]
(;B[ie];W[ql];B[qn]C[Here I blocked from this side to secure corner and
push W stone against thickness.

elvard: Good, just one thing, even after this move, your corner is not secured. You have to add one more stone, see variation]

elvard: Compare, how many points made black with his three stones, and white. Big difference, isn't it?

Moreover, this move is not good, you could settle by M2, as I showed you before]
;W[je]C[elvard: Terrible overplay];B[jd];W[ke];B[if]TR[jf]C[elvard: Don't try to safe all your stones! White would gain just 4 or 5 points in gote by playing J14. And, the most important fact is, that you don't need these two stones:
 - they are cutting two strong groups
 - they are not connecting anything
 - they are making no points
