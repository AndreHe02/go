C[I would have played A, I think.  It makes the White stones fight hard for eye space, and prepares to extend down the right side.  K15 doesn't do a lot; it works towards a moyo on the left side, but there is still plenty of room to invade.

A is what White normally plays himself in response to P17, so it seems like you ought to be able to punish him.]

D, protecting the cutting point at C.  White could really make a lot of trouble there, since if he makes the cut, your stones on the left could have trouble making eye space.

E, hoping to exchange it for F and then go on.

[sc][se]C[This game went back and forth a lot, but you hit the jackpot when it counted.  If it weren't for that big capture, you would have had very little territory.

Here's what I would take away from this game:

1) Don't play contact moves when attacking!  Surround from a distance.  All you have to do is prevent him from making eyes.  When you stretch your stones tightly around his, you'll get cutting points.  If you make a loose net, you can firm up any connections if he approaches them.

2) Always look for opportunities to use the eye-stealing tesuji - it usually comes up a few times a game.

3) It's hard to figure out a player's style from one game, but you could probably stand to be more aggressive.  In this game, all the invading was done by White, and a lot of it succeeded.  You left White alone on the lower side and he got 40 points (and should have had a lot more, but he let you walk right into it).  Don't be afraid to die, at this level.]

It's not necessarily a great move, but it often is, because it usually really ruins White shape.
