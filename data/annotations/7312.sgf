C[Hi, 

My name is Corey and I'll be reviewing this game for you today. I've been playing Go for about 6 1/2 months and currently ranked ~ 15k 

Since I see you're about 30k, I'll try and stick with some basics. Please feel free to email me at farplanedragon@gmail.com with any questions or any other reviews, as I'd be more then happy to review them. Additionly you can find me on KGS as FarplaneCM if you have further questions.

To begin, some general comments.

 Playing someone ranked 18k at your rank isn't a mistake so to speak, however, this game should have been played with some type of handicap. In general, black receives 1 stone for each level of difference up to 9 stones. 

It's understandable to be embarrassed when receiveing a large handicap, however, keeping the game even allows white to play an interesting game, and ultimately, you will learn better with proper handicap.

Another thing to keep in mind, it's helpful to include an english translation if possible. Because I am only able to speak English, I apologise if I skip over any non-english comments or questions. If you'd like to send me a translated version, I'd be more then happy to answer questions/comments.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[ed]C[In general, opening moves should be played on a 3rd or 4th line, or on a star point (Hoshi) I've marked some common opening points in the corner.

*See marked stones*

Openings on the 2nd line or lower secure too little territory to be of use, while openings past the 4th line tend to be too loose and easy to invade.]

(;W[pn]C[This is a pretty loose move on white's part. One that could be easily invading depending on how he chooses to follow up.]
;B[dj]C[This move is probably too early. I've marked a couple possible moves in the alternate line here. While I can't say if they're the best or proper, you should try to take advantage of white's loose move of Q6. This forces white to follow-up or risk loosing the bottom right corner.]

(;W[pf];B[kd]C[While you might be trying to shape half the board into two halves, a quick glance can tell you that white has a bigger half at this point. 

It's important to keep in mind a basic idea of openings. Playing stones on a 3rd line is usually a defensive posture meant to secure territory, while 4th line moves tend to be more offensive in hopes of expanding. 

It's important to keep in mind as black, since you're playing a game where white receives 6.5 points of komi, you need to try and secure an extra 7 points at some time. 

Sadly, white seems to be taking advantage of your newness and is playing fairly agressively at this point.]
;W[jp];B[do]C[It's a good idea to approach, however, one basic concept to keep in mind, in the words of my teacher Lee, 

"When stone touches stone, you make the opposing stone stronger"

What that means if your opponent has a single stone, if you must apporach, don't play directly next to it if possible. Since white has the next move, he'll be able to capture your black stone before you can capture him.  

A move such as F4 for example serves to gain territory and split white, both which can be helpful. Anything to the left of white's D4 would likely be too small, while below it would be too deep.]

(;W[eo];B[co];W[dn];B[cn]TR[co][do]C[o5 [18k?\]: я щас тупо играть буду

While running is important, this shape is known as an "Empty Triangle" and should be avoided if possible.]
;W[dm]C[Psvetly [?\]: зачем? :)
o5 [18k?\]: испортил все вторым ходом]
;B[cm];W[dl];B[cl];W[pq]C[Personally, this move could have probably waited until later, since black has no stones on either side, however, the notion of securing a loose corner is important.]
;B[nd]C[This is a decent move, it helps secure your corner from invasion.]
;W[hd]TR[ff][jf][kf][lf][fg][fh][fi]C[This is somewhat reckless of white, especially with no stones at the marked points to run to.]
;B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[fd];B[gd];W[ge];B[gc];W[ee];B[de]TR[fc]
[dd]C[Playing one of the marked points may have been helpful to secure from invasion, especially at F17. IF White splits your groups up to, you're in big trouble]
;W[ef];B[df];W[dg];B[eg];W[fg];B[eh];W[fh];B[di];W[cg];B[fi]
TR[fc][dd]C[Not the best of ideas,  F17 being left empty is running the risk of being split, same with D16. White is following strong advice, being to attempt to split black into as many small weak groups as possible.]
;W[gi];B[fj];W[gj];B[ek]TR[dh][dk]C[This...doesn't accomplish much. A move at either marked point may have provided some extra security.]
;W[dk];B[em]TR[ck]C[Bad idea, the marked move would have been a proper response. Playing here is inviting white to split and possibly capture a large group.]
;W[ck]TR[cg][dg][di][dj]C[As expected, white pushes through, splitting your lower stones from the two marked and potentially adding strength to the two marked white stones.]
;B[bk]TR[cj]C[White should be thanking you here, you're pushing him towards his own two stones. Instead, you should have played at the marked space may have allowed you to blocked white, though at this point, he's probably going to connect to his upper two stones regardless of what you do.]
;W[cj];B[ci];W[bj];B[bi];W[bl];B[al];W[bm];B[bn];W[ak];B[an]
;W[am]
(;B[ai];W[aj]C[Important move for white. He's given life to his group.]
;B[en];W[ep];B[el]TR[cl][cm][an][bn][cn][co][do]C[This, probably is too early. You going to lose far more points at this time if white captures your black group, then if he tries pushing through here.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[ao];W[bq];B[aq]C[There really isn't much point playing here, as this stone creates a "False Eye" meaning your group can be captured. At his point, it's probably wiser to let white take this corner and focus on securing your other two corners as well as planning an invasion on the bottom white corner.]
;W[ar];B[cq]C[Not any real help. You're basically forcing white to make the moves he wants to make.]
;W[ap];B[br]TR[cl][cm][an][bn][cn][ao][co][do][bp]C[Same thing as before. You're forcing white to take your large marked group.]
;W[bo]C[This is huge for white, not only does he gain 9 captures, but 9 points of territory as well within the captured area. Some people might say this move is with 18 points.

Now, to be honest, this is the point in the game where you might have to consider the idea of forfeiting. White just made a large point gain, and only currently controls a large the majority of the current board. 

Remember, there's no dishonor in admitting your losses. It's considered wiser to forfeit and review your mistakes, then foolishly to continue on. 

However, you probably got a good 10 or so moves try and makes some games before you should forfeit.]
;B[bs];W[cr]TR[cq][br][bs]C[This kills all the marked stones. None should be able to live unless white falls asleep. Remember, securing your weak territory is more important after a major loss.]
;B[dr];W[dq];B[cs];W[er];B[cq]TR[cp][bq][dq][br][dr][cs]C[The marked stones start what is known as a "Ko Fight" . While it's a chance to make a few points, your 5 stones are already dead, so unless white lets you make 5 or more captures in the fight, you're still going to be at a loss in the end.]
;W[es];B[ng]C[Good, you threaten to split the two right side corners apart.]
;W[ph]C[White runs....];B[kg]TR[pj]C[Bad idea. First off, you're letting white continue running down to his support. Second, there's far fewer points at stake in this area then on the right side/corner at this point.

A play at the star point (Hoshi) threatens to split white apart, forcing him to try and connect.]
;W[jf];B[kf];W[je];B[ke];W[oe];B[nf];W[od];B[ne]TR[kd][nd][ke]
[kf][nf][kg][ng]C[Yes, the marked stones form a strong shape, but you're allowing white to invade the upper right corner.]
;W[oc];B[nc];W[qd];B[ob];W[qc];B[pb];W[qb];B[qa];W[ra];B[pa]
;W[rc];B[mi]TR[pj]C[As discussed earlier, you should be aiming to split white apart at the side. The middle of the board is worth little point wise. Remember, the basic concept is to try to take the corners, then the sides, then the middle.]
;W[nb]C[White chooses to punish you for leaving a "Cutting Point" open. It's typically import to make sure your opponent can't cut through and split apart your groups.]
;B[mb];W[oa]C[Slip up by white. Typically, you should avoid "Self Atari"]
;B[na];W[pd];B[li];W[ll];B[fc];W[dd]TR[fe]C[Likely another slip up by white. Playing at the mark point would have saved his stone and probably keep his group stronger.]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[fd];W[ce];B[cd]TR[pj][pk]C[Once again, you're basically forcing white to make the move he wants to make.  Plays at either of the marked points stand to cost white more points then he'd gain by capturing your two stones.]
;W[cf];B[dc];W[de];B[cc];W[dh];B[ei];W[pk]C[Ouch! Whites play here is an important one. If you're going to try to split him apart, you have to do it now. Any later and white could be too tight to get through. Even now, this play is going to make it very difficult to split white apart.]
;B[ig]TR[ik]C[You should be worried about the right side and bottom right corner, not this area.

A play at the marked space might have allowed you some connection between your two groups]
;W[hf];B[jg];W[ji]C[Ouch, another hard hit by white. So far, he's doing whatever he can to keep your groups split apart,]
;B[ii];W[ki];B[jh];W[kh];B[lh];W[ij];B[jj];W[kj];B[jk];W[hi]
;B[ih];W[kk];B[ik];W[hj];B[gk];W[hk];B[hl];W[gl];B[fk];W[il]
;B[hm];W[jl];B[gm];W[in];B[fl];W[gn];B[fm];W[hn];B[oh]TR[pi]
C[This doesn't do enough. Considering white's current lead, you pretty much have to attempt a move like Q11 for example.]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[og];B[nh];W[nk];B[oj];W[pi];B[pj];W[qj];B[nj]
;W[ok];B[mk];W[ml];B[lj];W[lk];B[mj];W[mq]C[This is not really needed. Black has no basis for invasion into this area.]
;B[qg]C[This is pretty reckless. If you take the time to read ahead one or two moves, you'd see black isn't really going to have any stones to run to.]
;W[pg];B[rh];W[qi];B[rf];W[re];B[sf];W[ri];B[si];W[sj];B[sg]
;W[qf];B[qk];W[ql];B[rk];W[rl];B[sk];W[rj];B[pl];W[ol];B[fo]
;W[fn];B[fp];W[fq]C[At this point, the idea of forfeiting and reviewing your gameplay should be stronger. White has gained a large amount of territory in the bottom half of the board, as well as the top right corner. Add on his captures, and komi and white has a very large lead that you're unlikely to be able to make up. 

However, since the bottom area is still somewhat empty, it's understandable to want to try and make something work there.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[hq];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip];B[im];W[jm];B[jk]C[This is a wasted move, white has too many ways to connect his groups for this to do anything.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[hg];B[kc];W[bd];B[bc];W[ad];B[ac];W[bf];B[af]
;W[ag];B[bh];W[bg];B[gh];W[hh];B[ie];W[if];B[gf]TR[gh]C[Very poor move, you're putting the 2 marked stones into self-atari.

Additionally, with the lead white has, you're not going to win this game by making a few captures here and there.]
;W[gg];B[ec]C[Psvetly [?\]: лишний ход];W[pm]C[o5 [18k?\]: да]
;B[qp]C[Unless white falls asleep, the odds of you making life here are very, very small.]

Alright, well, a few closing comments. Just to repeat what I said earlier. 

1. Try to find someone closer to your rank to play.

2. If playing someone of a different rank, always use a proper handicap.

3. Given that you're 30k, it's probably a bit early for you to be playing on a 19x19 board, as it's easy to become over-whelmed. I'd recommend finding some players between 30 and 22k to play some 13 x 13 games with, and ask the players if they would mind doing a quick review for you. Keep that up until you start feeling comfortable playing 13x13 games. At that point. Try moving back up to 19x19. 

Beyond that, just spend about 10 - 15 minutes when you log on reviewing the basics, and try and play stronger players as much as possible. 

30k through 10k goes by fast, and if you put some effort into it, you will make it there in no time. 

Good luck and feel free to contact me with any additional questions.]
