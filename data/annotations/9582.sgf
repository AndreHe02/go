C[So I'm playing white in an even game against an opponent approximately my own level on the IGS.

(DrK: Dear Hallonen, I will be your reviewer for this game. I note in your instructions that I am to focus mainly on White's play.

Before I begin, I note that to this day, I find this page helpful in relation to how to evaluate a move in any given game: http://senseis.xmp.net/?StrategyForBeginners4Questions

Please read this before you begin and have it in mind when you look at your moves.

I usually try to find 2-3 things specific that I think you can work on, as well as making pointers to things I think you should pay attention to. I also note in your pre-game comment you want me to suggest what topic to study first specific to your level/style/weakness.

All comments are in brackets.

If I miss something or if you have any questions in relation to this review, please email drk.derek@gmail.com.

Cheers

[nq][mq][mc][nd][np]TR[jj][eo][do][ep][qj][pj]C[I've read that it's generally a good idea for beginners to play this double 4-4 set-up before moving on to various other set ups.

(DrK: I've never heard of this suggestion before but this is a balanced way to begin the game. I have no issue as long as your first objective is to take corner which requires the least number of stones to control/claim area.

I personally follow the adage of "A swordman should not have a favourite sword" in other words if the game is a serious one by all means stick with what you know but otherwise I would prefer to explore/play differently/play unusually. X are moves I would also think is playable for you. Triangle - Just for your idea I also put in moves that are playable but probably require you to be a bit stronger first (they are not necessarily better just possible).)]
;B[fq];W[cm]C[I];B[cg]
(;W[ce]C[Should this have been a full knight's jump instead? Up against the opponent stone?

(DrK: Your move is playable. However, it is purely defence as the natural response of black is to make a base at C10. 

Let's take a look at the whole board:

1.Do you have a weak group?
No. Both D16 and D4 groups look quite safe. D16 is at corner and can defend (which is what you did) or run to the centre so is quite safe even though it is one stone by itself.

2.Does your opponent have a weak group?
Yes. Both C13 and F3 are alone and by themselves.

3.Can you make a big territorial move?
Yes, at K16.

4.Could your opponent make a big territorial move or does s/he have a big territory?
Yes. K16, Q10 and somewhere at bottom part of board.

I would suggest the key strategic consideration and most urgent thing to do here is to attack C13 or F3 as per 2 because they are both weak. I note attacking C13 seems to be the best move. See variations).]
;B[dg];W[nc]C[Maybe I should have pincered him instead...

(DrK: I would it being the most urgent. However, your move is okay.)]
;B[hp]
(;W[qj]MA[cj][ne][qf][kp][kq][jq][lp][fe][jd][qg][pf][pj]C[This felt like the biggest move on the board so I went for it.

(DrK: This is a decent and big move yes. But I would not say it is the biggest. For your reference X are what I think are also similarly big compare with R10.

I consider c10 (the pincer) to be the biggest, because
a. it removes c13's group's easy access to a base.
b. It strengthens white's group at C7 (which black can potentially attack)
c. Black inevitably has to respond to c10 so after the response from black white is free to play at R10 (or some other points).

This highlight a concept that everybody has to gradually understand - "urgent move before big move". I am learning about this too so you don't have to be overly concerned about it at your level.

See variations as to why other moves are similarly big compare with R10. I won't examine the obvious ones like Q10 or similar motifs.)]
;B[qg]
(;W[ql]C[Trying to get myself a base.

(DrK: Normally, a one space extension does not give enough space for a secure base. R7 is better. See variation.)]
;B[qn]
(;W[rn]C[(DrK: I don't like this move. Black can easily capture. See variation.)]
;B[qo];W[jd]C[Yeah I guess this is besides the point as the lower right isn't exactly finished.

(DrK: It's a reasonable move. R10 white group if black plays correctly will have to run to the centre anyway to live as its base is too small to make 2 eyes.)]
;B[rm]
(;W[sm]
(;B[qm];W[rl];B[ro];W[sn];B[so];W[sl]C[It feels like I got away pretty cheaply.

(DrK: I am afraid that you were lucky. If black plays correctly white's stones at this area would all be killed. See variation at move 21 - what black could have done.

White should not have played at T7. See variation.)];B[nd]
(;W[mc];B[oc]
(;W[ob]MA[lp][kp][kq][cj][nl][fe]C[I guess there's basic joseki for these kind of situations?

(DrK: Not really. N17 is very defensive and timid. It is suitable if white is heavily surrounded by black stones. in here white is strong and supported by white stones close by so it does not need to play so close to the board. See variation.

However, your moves are okay except P18 - too small. P18 can be played after the bigger points are played. e.g. X

Also, once you have played at P18, the option to invade at R17 is closed. At this stage you don't know for sure R17 is not good. See variation.)]
;B[md];W[lc];B[pb]
(;W[nb]C[(DrK: Just because black threaten to capture a stone does not mean you have to protect it. P18 is very small. You can comfortably sacrifice it if black takes it. See variation.)]
;B[ld];W[kd];B[lf]
(;W[kf]C[(DrK: In general, one should avoid playing moves that "touch" opponent's stone as it prompts opponent to strengthen it. See variation.)]
;B[ke];W[je];B[le];W[jg]C[And this is horrible, I've been overdoing playing for eye shape when I should just nobi instead.

(DrK: This is not an eye-shape however (false eye only). But yes it is due to you play move that "touches" opponent's stones.

Incidentially, neither white nor black for 20+ moves play at C10 which is the biggest move - either white take away base or black create a base.)]
;B[kg]C[And this happens and I look pretty silly:)

(DrK: well it does not really threaten too much. If I am playing speed I probably take one look at the board and either play L4 or C10 which are bigger, or O9 as white's group on right side is not yet alive.)]
;W[jf];B[kh];W[jh]C[And I keep pushing from behind, which isn't too good.]
;B[ki];W[dj]C[Decided to switch my attention and limit his pillar's potential.

(DrK: Good. I prefer C10 but it's personal preference. In any case, black's stones at top right can still be attacked.)]
;B[ji]
(;W[ii];B[jj];W[fh]C[This is also besides the point I guess, my idea was to entomb the two black stones.

(DrK: This is good. I prefer F14 because F14 limits black's ability to invade top left corner. But even if black succeeds in invading top left it is still quite small anyway. See variation.)]

(;B[ij]
(;W[hj]C[(DrK: I don't like this move. White's stones are very strong already black can't do much. Instead white should try to invade black's groups. See variations.)]
;B[ik];W[hi];B[hm];W[oj]C[Wrong part of the board as well?

(DrK: No this is good. The precise place for white to play is debatable, but white here both strengthen it's own group and reduce black's stones. Very important.)]

(DrK: unnecessarily cautious. White's stones are strong the cut points are hard to be exploited. See variation.)]

(DrK: yeah but wrong way to connect. See variation.)];B[dr]

(;W[cj]C[(DrK: A cut is ineffective when both cut groups are alive. Even if black is to cut white is still okay so it can be ignored. If black can live then you should play so that black cannot form 2 eyes. See variation.)]
;B[ch]
(;W[bg]C[Yeah this is optimistic..

(DrK: Touching a stone from under is a special strategy for specific situation. This is not the right place for it. Instead, the first rule of killing a group of stones (if it is killable) is to first take away space it can expand to, then make it small and then destroy opportunity to make 2 eyes. See variation.)]
;B[bf];W[di];B[bh];W[bi];B[ag];W[ah]C[And here I was at my last stone at a couple of seconds so, misfired something awful.

[sc][sp][sq]C[I'm thinking my biggest mistakes had to do with allowing him a great wall which should have won him the game... Switching fronts leaving stuff unfinished and being overly fearful of just playing nobi at times. He gave the game away so in the end I think I just got lucky.

(DrK: Ignoring black's own blunders, I believe the moves that white could have improved and turns out to significantly affect the score of this game are:

Move 12 - remove base of opponent takes precedence over big points.
Move 14 - as white did not make a sufficient base.
Move 38 - too small. Like you said here at that time I suggest you can consider invading at the bottom of the board already.
Move 96 - did not assess the life and death of top left black group accurately. Although to be fair it takes ages and easily get wrong. I get wrong sometimes so we can always improve on this.
Move 98 - this move does not work.

I suggest that move that touches opponent stone from under like in move 16 and 98 are quite advanced techniques for very specific situations. Hard to explain unless I have a good example. I suggest you avoid it until you are stronger.

I have no issue with your opening moves at your level of play. I would suggest studying joseki is a bit premature for you. At this level just remember start with corner, then side, then the rest of the board. Instead, I think you will benefit from:
1. Studying whole board strategy and life & death. Try to have the Strategy For Beginners 4 Questions in mind for every move of your game. 
2.Do lots of Tsumegos. 
3. Play against stronger opponents and review games. (if you wish to continue in go, I believe you cannot be afraid to a. lose b. review at least one thing each time you lose c. pincer d. at higher level, ko).

If you wish to read books, specific for you I recommend the Elementary Go series (esp. book 1 In the beginning; or the Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go by Kageyama Toshiro. Or if you are cheap (like me) just study here http://senseis.xmp.net/?BeginnerStudySection. Youtube has heaps of lessons. I think this one may be useful to you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSbD02gtS8k)

Hope this is helpful and good luck!
