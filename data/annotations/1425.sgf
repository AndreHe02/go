[pe:d][oe:e]C[bent: This seems very slow to me. Sure White has eliminated the aji of a black cut, but as black ends up with an extension at the top, a move around 'a' becomes very big.
The attach and extend joseki fits better when there is a white stone around 'b'. Then you could omit 'Q14', and play elsewhere. When black then pushes through, you have the choice of giving way, while making fourth line territory (B'c', W'd', B'e', W'Q14').
Here white has built a thick group, but the usefullness of it's power would be greatly reduced by a black stone around 'R9'.]
;B[qn];W[qk]LB[np:a][rp:b][qq:c]C[bent: good direction; W'a', B'b', W'c', B'R9' is out of question, it would make it to easy for black to settle himself in white's spere of influence.
I think black should have played 'R9' himself if he wants to play on the right side, making 'R12' and 'R6' miai and thus creating a relatively stable group between white's positions (wariuchi).]

;B[mq];W[mp];B[rn];W[so];B[on]TR[mm][nm][mn]LB[lq:a]C[bent: this seems bad for black, he creates a burden for himself. White's wall is not weak and a move at a marked place will give black a hard time; later 'a' will build up the lower side while putting pressure on black's corner group.]
;W[oq];B[or];W[nm]TR[oq][or]LB[lq:a][lr:b][kr:c]C[bent: when you play the marked exchange you take away one liberty of your group and loose a ko threat, so you should do it only if you intend to play the lettered sequence immediately, else keep it in reserve; nevertheless your last move seems to be the good direction and black might have a hard time to settle this group or escape.]
;B[ol];W[om];B[pl];W[nl];B[qi]LB[pj:a]TR[pl][ol][qn][rn][on]
C[bent: This is an overplay, White is to strong in the surroundings. Now you should simply play 'a'. If black moves out with his marked group you will swallow the single stone while continuing the attack, if black moves his single stone he won't be able to save his marked group.]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[pj];B[oj];W[nk];B[qj];W[pi];B[ql];W[ph];B[rk]
C[bent: black has managed to create a living group, and even if white gets a lot of influence towards the center he has played all his stones on the right side of the board.]
;W[pn]LB[lq:a][lr:b][kr:c]C[bent: too small, and losing the initiative (gote). You should play the double hane Wa, Bb, Wc or make an approach move against a corner stone.]
;B[pm];W[po];B[lq];W[rm];B[rl];W[sn]C[bent: Black is alive anyway, so this move worth only 4 points in gote.
White lost 2 moves in a row in this sector.];B[ep];W[rh];B[ri]
;W[qh]C[bent: Again this move is not sente against the black group, so you loose the initiative, black should play on the left side now. As the last move isn't sente and worth only a few points, you should have played elsewhere. The game is already hopeless for white.]

C[bent: 'a' would take the corner and keep white to one eye.]

C[bent: black should have played 'D12' instead, keeping 'C10' and the marked group separated.]
