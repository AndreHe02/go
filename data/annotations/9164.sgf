C[B: Hi, I'm Bart, about 7 kyu on KGS and I'll try and review your game. My comments start with B:]
;B[dq];W[pp]LB[dd:A][cn:B][gq:C]C[I'm not sure the benifits or drawbacks of playing on the same side as black here...it will be a fighting game I assume?

B: black can still choose to play around D16 (A). It is more about influence and territory. As black, you would want to play around A or B. The right side (C) is not so important. Your stone is on 4-4, that means it's not protecting the corner, but used for influence. And in that case it would be better to play A yourself, or D5 for example.]
;B[qn]C[No a common move I would think...I was not sure how to respond... I should just play another corner and not worry if he pinches me at O3?

B: Q6 is more common, but this is played also. I think it would be a mistake to play elsewhere. What if black plays R3 after you play in another corner? See possible variation.]

(;W[qo];B[pj];W[pd];B[qe];W[qd];B[oc]C[B: this is a strange move by black.]

(;W[pc]C[I am not sure if there is a joseki, as I don't memorize set pieces very well, so my response might be poor to this attack...

B: for 14 kyu it's a good response. You protect the corner and keep the black stones separated. See variation for a different, but maybe more complicated response.]
;B[pe]
(;W[nc]C[B: now was a great oppotunity to keep the black stones separated (and weak!) by playing P16.]
;B[od];W[ob]C[B: yes, you connect, but black is now strong..]
;B[nd]C[B: ...and making a huge wall...];W[mc];B[md];W[lc]C[B: ...while you make a few points on the side.]
;B[jc]TR[la][ma][na][oa][pa][qa][lb][mb][nb][pb][qb]SQ[ne][oe]
[nf][of][pf][qf][ng][og][pg][qg][rg][oh][ph][qh][rh][oi][pi]
[qi][ri][qj][rj][pk][qk][rk][ol][pl][ql][rl][qm]C[seems like a trade off- black gets outer-influence. I get some points.

B: yes, but don't underestimate the inflence. Right now I would rather play black. And play Q6 instead of K17. Blacks area is a lot bigger than that of white.]
;W[dc]C[I am always trying to find the biggest point in the openings.  My next move was trying to limit K17 potential.

B: looks good. And it's the last open corner.];B[fc];W[de];B[dg]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[do]C[Is this point better or should I have played K4 or even N4?

B: I think this is ok. If black gets C6 after you play N4 he has a lot of potential.]
;B[fp];W[dk];B[cj];W[ck];B[np];W[lq]C[This moves seems a stretch. I felt a little behind and thought that more drastic measures needed to be taken than securing the corner, which would allow him to play K3 or K4.

B: yes, good choice. This might work. And your corner group is hard to kill with one move and can still go out into the center.]
;B[mq];W[hq]C[B: maybe a little too far to make a base. What if black plays K3 now?]

(;B[rd];W[qb]C[Because of the weakness of Q18 I knew I had to defend.  This move works but there must be better?

B: I would've played the same. Other moves don't protect the weakness, or give away more corner (e.g. Q18)]
;B[rc]
(;W[rb]LB[hc:B][on:A][lo:D][cp:C]C[B: because of the previous move, black took part of the corner. Your group is safe, and playing here now only protects about 4 points. There are much bigger moves on the board now. Some suggestions: A to D.]
;B[qc];W[pb];B[of]C[At this point, I am behind.  Black has greater inner influence and I have small pockets of points with only one group almost settled.  Please help point out my flaws of the opening at this point and how to balance side board points with inner influence.  Also please direct my best plan of attack at this point forward, (as I will surely be in a similar situation again).  How can I look to make my positions stronger in this unideal position?

B: first: it's good that you see this. Reducing the right side would probably not be enough, so see if you can find weak black groups to attack. Not to kill, only to attack and build points on the other side. My previous comment (move 38) has some suggestions (A-D).]
;W[qm]C[I was exploring the pinch for the first time.  Trying some things out I guess!

B: good.];B[pn]
(;W[dj]C[What is the point of tenuki and how to make it a good decision?  Sometime I tenuki just because...

B: a good example was at move 38. Black made a move that would take a lot of points if you would tenuki. So you respond. Next move he made was much smaller. So you can decide to tenuki because you see an urgent or bigger move elsewhere.

B: here I would respond, because you gave him the choice to play Q6 or S6. He chose Q6, so it would make sense for you to take S6.]
;B[ci];W[lp];B[pr];W[qq];B[rn]C[B: now black has both Q6 and S6. Your stone at R6 is very alone, and your corner is in danger.]
;W[qr];B[pq]
(;W[oq]LB[oo:A]C[B: or try to find the weak point to separate the groups. P5 or P4 is worth exploring. See variations.]
;B[or];W[mr];B[nr];W[ms];B[op];W[ro];B[po];W[qp];B[nn]C[My corner isn't good and I've lost more center influence.

B: yes. See previous comment.];W[mp];B[nq]
(;W[qi]LB[fp:B][lq:A]C[I am now starting to panic a bit based on the logic of this attack..  What was a better attack?

B: yes, you can imagine black playing R10. You can let black have this area, if you can get compensation elsewhere. Now your group A is stronger, you can try attacking group B. See variation.]
;B[qj];W[rf];B[re];W[rg];B[pi];W[qh];B[ri]C[This progression demonstrates my weakness at attacking and making life in small areas.  I'm not really sure I had a chance in the first place with this attack, which is a bigger problem I didn't recognize.

B: yes, because of the strong walls by black, and his extra stone at Q10, living there is quite impossible (there are of course some dan players that will manage, but mortals like you and me won't :-)).]
;W[ge]C[B: good! That pressures two black groups, and get your stones out into the center.]
;B[hd]
(;W[fh]C[B: idea is good, but better to let your stone work together with one of the white surrounding groups. See variation.]
;B[df];W[ce];B[ff];W[fe];B[gf];W[he];B[jd];W[if]C[I am chasing this group while trying to gain some center influence.

B: good, almost the same result as my variation.];B[ld]
(;W[ih]C[B: maybe better to play H12];B[gh];W[gi];B[fi];W[fj]
;B[ei];W[hh]
(;B[gg]C[B: what if black plays E10?];W[ej];B[di];W[hn]C[F6 might have been safer.  I was trying to link my lower middle group which is still weak.

B: agreed. Or G6.];B[bp];W[bo];B[fn];W[em];B[en];W[dn];B[dp]
;W[fm]C[B: good. Would have played G7 as black.];B[lm];W[nh]
C[I knew saving the right stones would be impossible (?) by a move like P 12 or Q13, so I wanted to use this stone expand my center influence.

B: yes. Good.];B[oh];W[nj]
(;B[pl]LB[lh:A]C[B: black doesn't have to respond. No way you can get that stone out. He could have tried a move like A.]
;W[kl];B[li]C[I have spread my self thin so this attack seems good. O 10 and 12 need to be recovered!

B: yes, and black is a bit easy on you.];W[lk];B[hp];W[ip];B[ho]
;W[jn]C[J 5 would be better?

B: usually yes, but because of the weakness at G6, I think this is ok.]

B: probably. O13 and E18 are big and sente as well.];B[er];W[fq]

B: E18. Or if you want to play there locally L13.];B[kg];W[le]
C[...trying to recover...];B[mf];W[kd]C[trying to isolate black's top left group]

;W[gp];B[go];W[gq]C[I had to play here in order to not look stones.  was there a better way to approach killing this group?

B: no, group was always alive (as I can see). See earlier comment.]

;B[cc];W[cb];B[ig];W[ll];B[jg];W[tt];B[tt]C[strange endgame...sort of random....suggestions for improvements?

B: try to look for big moves that the opponent has to repond to (sente). Find the next move and repeat. You played some moves black didn't need to respoond to. And when you started the ko fight, both players abandoned it and played elsewhere. That was a bit strange.

B: all in all a good game. You know where the big points are, which groups are strong and weak, and then you're behind. Hopefully I was able to give you some useful comments. Have fun and play on!]
