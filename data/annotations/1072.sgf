;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[qf]LB[eq:a][iq:b][ip:c]C[A, B and C would be other good points for B to play.

A is a calm, territory-oriented move which forms a corner enclosure and can be developed further along the left side.   B and C form the famous low and high Chinese Opening.]

(;W[jd]LB[nc:a]C[W should better answer at A.

In the variation, I show a very possible further development.]
;B[nd]LB[rd:a]N[game]C[B plays very fighty here. Sliding calmly into the corner is good enough for B.]

(;W[ne]LB[pf:a]C[W should attach at A. See variation for a further explanation.

(Also, this outside attachment at O15 does not work well.)]
;B[od]N[game];W[oe];B[pc];W[qd];B[qc];W[pf];B[qj]LB[lc:a][md:b]
C[Extending to A seems to be better in this situation.

Otherwise W can play B (as done later in this game) and seal B in in the corner and this way dominate the top.]
;W[qg];B[rc]LB[rd:a]C[A is better.];W[rd];B[sd]C[This move is a small endgame move. It should be played later.]
;W[md];B[rf]LB[re:a]C[B can link up with A.];W[se];B[sc];W[re]
;B[mc];W[nc];B[oc];W[lc];B[mb];W[lb];B[nb];W[le]TR[jd]C[In this position, it becomes clear that the marked white stone is wasted.   It is placed too close to the white wall on the M-line and that's doesn't work effectively.]
;B[eq]LB[dj:a][cj:b]TR[dd]C[Now, in this situation, playing the corner enclosure is too passive.

A is now the biggest move for both sides. If W plays there, he can form a huge moyo (territorial framework). A stone at A works well with the marked stone and the white thickness in the upper right part of the board.

And B can play an ideal extension from his corner enclosure. He can also play at B.]
;W[cm]LB[ck:a][em:b][ch:c][dj:d]C[This is too close to B's corner. B can play a pincer at A, W has to jump out to B and Black can C, creating a stable group on the left side.

This outcome would be better for Black as the C7 stone will be a weak group which has to be taken care of later. Also Black gains some profit on the left side which would be more W's domain if he had played at D.]
;B[cf]C[Too aggressive. See my previous comment for a better play.]
;W[ch]LB[cj:a]TR[cf][cm]C[This move is also too aggressive. It invites B to counter-attack. Better play calmly at A which saves two purposes:

1. It forms a stable group with the white marked stone.

2. It is still a strong pincer-attack against the black marked stone.]
;B[ck];W[em];B[ek]C[Now W has two weak groups surrounded by stronger black positions]
;W[bo];B[bp];W[dj]TR[bo][cm][em]C[Avoid this peep as you only force B to strengthen himself and this way make life more difficult for the marked stones.]
;B[dk];W[cj];B[dm]C[Better keep W's groups devided and then choose which of them to attack.]
;W[cl]TR[dm]LB[bk:a][ej:b]C[It is more important to keep both W groups divided than to save the marked stone. So better play A.

If W later on takes the marked stone go for the upper group with B.]
;B[dl];W[bk];B[co];W[bn]TR[cf]LB[jq:a]C[The result of this fight is - strategically speaking - in favor for W.

W linked up his stones and created some sure territory. The marked black stone looks lonely.  Although Black built a wall around the D-line, W can easily diminish this by invading around A.]
;B[jp];W[jr]LB[hp:a][np:b][dn:c]C[This invasion seems to be wrong. W can, of course, create a living group. But it will be small, and B can in exchange fortify his territory around it.

Playing lightly at A or B looks better. Both moves can easily run away towards the center and destroy B's territorial framework. Also, the aji of C can be used for this strategy.]

;W[il];B[jk]TR[kl][km][kn][ko][lo][lp]C[Now, W's marked group is captured and should be abandoned.]

;B[nk];W[oi];B[om]C[After this kill, the game is essentially over. W lost too much by trying to save his group around L7.

Some general comments for both players:

1. Play more calmly. Don't go too much into local fights. Stabilize your own groups first before going into risky fights.

2. Learn to 'divide'. Go is a game about dividing territory. You have to learn that taking a part of the board also means giving something away. Don't try to take all by invading and fighting blindly every local fight.

3. Learn to read more ahead. Try to find out how your opponent will answer and if his answer will really give you the result you want.

4. Learn to abandon stones which became useless or cannot be saved. Don't add stones to a dead group.]

(;W[pf]TR[jd]C[In general, when B plays a double approach against a corner stone, W should first attack the stronger of both black stones.   The idea behind this is to gain strength against the other weaker stone while attacking the stronger one. The black stone at O16 is weaker because it is pincered by the marked white stone.

(Please keep in mind that this strategy does not always work. So don't apply this rule blindly without evaluating the surrounding positions.)]
