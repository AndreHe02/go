C[Hello, this game was played on the EGC 2012. Please review for Black.

Not sure what went wrong and where.

dv: Hi, I am Dieter, Belgian 2d.

You played a decent territorial opening but then somewhat greedily invaded at 39. When ahead on territory but behind on strength, it is best to play more safely and to exchange some small territory for strength. This strategic choice made the game needlessly complicated.

At];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc];W[qn];B[nq];W[rp];B[qq];W[qk]
;B[cj];W[cg];B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[dl]C[dv: I'm not an opening theorist. In my opinion amateurs do very well in playing conventional openings they understand and avoid complications, or at least not try to make a *difference* in the opening.

Your opening is calm and stable. Perhaps Black should try harder to overcome komi, but I approve of your moves.]
;W[jc];B[cc]LB[qi:A][hq:B]C[dv: I don't think this is the best choice, since it is very easy for White to answer here: block at the wider side. Perhaps you are taking the territorial style too far now.

I would play at A instead, putting some pressure on that White group, or play B, to be the first to play on the lower side between symmetric positions.

But ... a 6d may prove me wrong.];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf]
;B[de];W[cf];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc];B[bd];W[eg]LB[ee:A]C[dv: I think White should play A, to capture in a loose ladder (geta). This leaves some aji.]
;B[lc]LB[qi:A][hq:B]C[dv: This move is definitely not urgent and it is probably not so good either, since you are approaching a group that has become very strong. I would still play A or B, with a preference for B now as it is farthest away from White's strength.]
;W[qg];B[hq]C[dv: Very good!];W[fo];B[jp]LB[kp:A]C[dv: Very good again. You have almost territory now at 4 places. Perhaps A would have been better, as it leaves more scope for sacrifice and is less heavy.]
;W[je]
(;B[qi]C[dv: With her last move, White is losing the territory contest, as she builds territory from her wall. But she is stronger on the board. Therefore, this invasion is misguided. I think you should gain strength and give some territory. See variation.]
;W[og];B[pj];W[pl];B[lg]LB[nj:A]C[JUG: not sure what to aim for at this position!?  bM13 felt a bit misplaced here.

dv: The game becomes confused due to your invasion. You were ahead, so there was no need to confuse the game. Indeed M13 is oddly placed, too close to her strong group. Simply jumping out with your weak group, at A, is probably best now.]
;W[le];B[oe];W[nf];B[mf]C[dv: This is where the trouble starts. You are not strong enough to fight here. Cutting White's forces is a good principle but you will cut yourself too and White is a bit stronger in the areas around, since you have grabbed territory early.]
;W[ne];B[me];W[nd];B[nc];W[md];B[ld];W[lf];B[mg];W[mc]
(;B[lb]C[dv: You must block instead. See var.];W[mb]C[dv: This is a terrible loss. White is connected with territory, your stones are floating. Now you are behind. Could you explain why you did not block? These are essential tactics.]
;B[nb];W[la];B[jg];W[kb]C[dv: Needless fear by White, but it removes the aji, which works in a winning position.]
;B[jf];W[ke];B[hf]LB[ee:A]C[dv: Aiming at A aji?];W[bq];B[rq]
LB[mj:A]SQ[mg][pj]C[dv: Your marked groups are weak. Although you are behind now, it is probably best to strengthen them by providing a loose connection like A.

On the other hand, playing more aggressively, like you do by sweeping away some eye space, is good gamesmanship.]
;W[lq]C[JUG: how to better handle this invasion?

dv: White plays very well now. She uses her strength and her advantage to actively turn it into victory. Let's see.]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[ko];W[mp];B[kq];W[lo]
(;B[kp]C[dv: See var.];W[mq];B[np]LB[on:A][pn:B][ro:C]C[dv: This is bad technique. See http://senseis.xmp.net/?SmallGaps

You should attack White on a larger scale (A or lean at B)]
;W[no];B[oo];W[nn];B[on];W[nm];B[om];W[ol];B[nl]C[dv: OK. The cut shows good fighting spirit when behind.]
;W[ln];B[nk];W[ri];B[rj]LB[rh:A]C[dv: Technical mistake. A cuts off White effectively.]
;W[qj];B[rh];W[pi];B[qh];W[ph];B[rg];W[oj]SQ[me][hf][jf][mf]
[jg][lg][mg][nk][nl]C[dv: White connects and cuts off Black's central stones on a large scale. This will be difficult to bear.]
;B[rk];W[rl];B[qf]LB[ll:A]C[JUG: perhaps 'A' instead better?

dv: Yes. Good point.];W[od];B[pc];W[pd];B[qe];W[ll];B[km];W[kn]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[lk]LB[nk:A]C[JUG: 'A' seems lost, what went wrong?

dv: As explained, the game went from difficult to worse, with moves 57, 67, 77 and 89, most of which were tactical mistakes. But these problems started when you decided to invade at 39, when you were leading in territory but not in strength.

In the end, White didn't try very hard to attack your weak centre but maintained a safe advantage.

Two remaining comments at 155 and 221.

End of commentary.
