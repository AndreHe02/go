(;B[jd]C[[b5 makes me feel slow. w6 is good. Now b7 is too aggressive. Once I feel something wrong with the opponent, I'll try to do something.\]]

(;W[fq]C[[It seems that you want to have the advantage in the lower-left corner, but don't forget, w2 is still weak!\]]
;B[cp];W[do];B[cq]C[[b9 and b11 are slow and a little bit strange.\]]

(;W[er]CR[fc][qf][jp][nq]LB[ep:A]C[Is this too aggressive?
I'm already thinking about killing the group and taking the corner. Is there a better play besides attacking?
My other thoughts would be extending along the bottom, invading the bottom right, enclosing the top left or top right...

[Let's see the corner. Before w12 comes, there are 3 black stones and 3 white stones. There is little chance to kill the black! Besides, the black can seperate the white stones into two parts, as b13 goes later.\]]

[di][dj]LB[fp:A]C[I was very happy with the exchange of the four black stones for my four white stones on lines 8-10.

[I'm afraid that the black may be happier. Let's see the situation now. Both of you have little territory, but you still have a weakness at point A. w2 is still alone. The upper-left corner is not white territory yet since the black has some way to invade.\]]

;W[hr]C[Nice Try!];B[lq];W[qq]CR[nq]C[I am always somewhat afraid of splitting stones like. Can playing at the circled point work better to reduce black's territory on the bottom right? If so, how do I make it work?

In the actual game I opted for the 3-3 point because I felt it was a safe way to reduce, less prone to my making mistakes

[w42 is much better than the circle point. There are already two black stones before w42 comes. Try to survive the white, and that is good enough!\]]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qr]C[Uh oh, this is not the joseki... did black make a mistake? How do I best punish for this move if it is 'wrong'?

LB[oe:A][oc:B]C[But this surprised me and seems bad. I don't think I dealt with it well either...

[One black stone is trying to fight against six white stone. The white is absolutely having the advantage! All you need to do is minimize the space of black, not to attack. The black will die without enough space.\]]

I am still somewhat confused by the concept of 'influence' because sometimes I manage to make some great territory around 'thick' groups, but sometimes they don't seem to matter?  We'll see what the effect of the 'influence' is on the rest of the game I guess...

[The thick wall worth less when there are opponent's stones around. For example, you have a pretty solid wall as marked, but it worth little since b41 is there.\]]

Skippy [13k\]: close];B[tt]C[[This is a good game. I have some advice for you to play better.

First, to attack, not to kill, unless you have 100% confidence to kill the opponent.

Second, maybe you need to do some more go problems. You made some mistakes in the early stage, but your opponent didn't find it out. If he did, this would be his game.

Third, the thick wall is not easy to turn into territory. You can not get points with only a few stones to secure it. Try to attack the weakness of the opponent, you will get some benefit.
