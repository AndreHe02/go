Hello,

I would like to know what I did wrong and how to improve. I played white and my rank
is IGS is 12k.

Thank you.

Hi Teemu!

I'm Michael Utech, Schnoffos@IGS (about 5-7k there)

This is my first comment, i hope you'll find it useful...

I will comment only moves that I think are bad, because our rating is to close and it is harder to identify a good move, than a bad one :-)

Bye,

What is better? Later this move caused me some trouble.

H4 is just not very effective. You'll find some of the local standard moves in the variations
but there are just too many possible moves localy to mention :)]
;B[fo];W[dn]C[If you played D6 before, would you now play H4? Don't think so. That's a good question to ask if you search for good/bad moves.]
;B[dr];W[hn]C[Well, C3 is joseki, the question is, wheter there are bigger moves on the board. perhaps o17 to gain the initiative. H6 has a very limitted value. It probably saves h4, but is that stone so important? you can not really put pressure on the f3 group (it's definitely alive with c3), you can not severly attack K4 (at least yet), it's not yet endgame, where you fight for some 5 points of territorial reduction. Playing at c3 or elsewhere is better...]
;B[cq]C[I lost a corner.];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[cf]
(;W[ch]C[It's also possible to play c15 (you have support at d10). This joseki fits very good in this case (imho)

the left side is open at the bottom (for black to reduce it).  To profit from C12, you have to add a move at the bottom to close the territory while if you play at C15 you begin to claim the corner while attacking C14 more severely.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[bc]C[Black should not try to live in the corner. Instead he should jump out to the center at e14 (first)]
;W[bb];B[cd];W[dc];B[ab];W[ca]C[I should play somethink bigger?

seems ok to me, at least regarding the continuation];B[de];W[ee]
;B[ef];W[fe];B[cg]
(;W[bh]C[You get you monkey jump to a15 later and territory at the left. Anyway for some reason i can't explain, this looks clumsy to me. Dunno why. (Better forget this comment :-)

I prefered the move at f14, followed by an idea of how to continue...]
;B[dh];W[di];B[eh];W[qc];B[qd];W[cp]C[Trying to make some territory. Perhaps this is bad move? Instead something like o4?

It's gote, so you may first try to play a bigger point like r6 or o3/4]
;B[bq];W[bp];B[ap];W[ao];B[aq];W[bn];B[mp]C[you played 6 moves to secure territory at the left side, worth about 20 pts. Even though i dont think blacks play is very good here, black got his group in the upper left alive plus influence toward center,  the lower left is secure territory, and he got to play n4, looks like this is more than 20 pts.]
;W[pn]C[
Is this move ok? Any better ideas what to do now?

You do not have much support from the outside yet for your invasion.   I think a move like o15 is much more appropriate here, since the upper is open to a black invasion (he has support from the right side) and the moyo up there will me much saver and larger.  Depending on blacks reaction, you may later either get influence to support a more efective invasion or secure your territory.

i have no idea, if q6 is a good point to invade. I would probably prefer to play r4 or r3.]
;B[ql];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[rq];W[nn]C[Now you split blacks troups into two parts, but you have no base for your group and have to run out. This will solidify black and may end up in beeing captured. Quite risky... and still H4/H6 is weak, black can play f7 to exploit this weakness while creating a chance to reduce these 20 pts. at the left side]
;B[oo];W[on];B[ol]C[Hm... Black should divide and attack, perhaps at m6. This move is has no real meaning in my opinion. Easy for white]
;W[ln];B[ko];W[kn];B[jn];W[lk];B[ml]

(;B[jm];W[ll];B[mm];W[mn];B[lm];W[km];B[jl];W[kl]
(;B[mj]C[Black seems to get big area because of my weak group.

Take a look at what may happen if black plays g7 (variation), i don't like blacks move too much]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[np]C[Trying to trick black here. Anything better? Run towards my left group? It would meaning to sacrifice my two stones. Idea behind this move was to reduce black area or leave black 5 stones weak between my stones.]
;B[nq];W[ki];B[mh];W[ij];B[hl];W[gm];B[gl];W[fm];B[fl];W[em]
C[a bad idea from black to force the two black stones to live without any compensation. white is out, the black wall doesnt do anything usefull]
;B[el];W[dl]
(;B[ne]C[the reduction you achieved with your invasion is nearly compensated by blacks territories to the right and lower side. Moreover your prospects of advancing the upper sides moyo are now nearly gone. Take a look at the variation for another alternative of black play]
;W[ld];B[lf];W[lp]C[
Now trying to attack the black stones. This was bad attack anyway.]
