(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]C[LB> The reason that I chose to have this game reviewed is that I am trying to change my style from an all out attacking strategy to a more balanced teqnique.  As I get better, more people successfully take advantage of my attacks by sacrificing and exploiting the many weaknesses I leave. Perhaps in this game I played too conservatively.  Komi has never meant anything to me, but I was hoping to utilize it in this game.  Tell me what you think and thanks for the review.  :)]

[pd];W[dc];B[ce];W[dh]C[LB> I am a little worried that Black till tenuki

First off all I think your move is not bad.

If you are worried about a Black tenuki, why not tenuki
yourself? :-)

Instead of D12, an alternative might be F16.

I would prefer D$. But this is a matter of personal style.];B[df];W[fd]
C[LB> perhaps it whould be at G17 to keep sente?

I don't know if G17 keeps sente. It looks more relaxed.];B[bc];W[dq]C[LB> this turned out badly

Indeed. Whites shape at the top is not ok. White has to play
K17 instead of D3. After K17 Black would normaly play a pincer
against D12. But this is too slow with the two open corners.
So he would leave the situation as is. But then Black feels
uncomfortable and has to worry about his stones B17,C15,D14
being chased later in the game.];B[hd];W[ff];B[eg];W[fg];B[eh];W[kd]C[LB> too agressive?

I would call it natural. :-)];B[hf];W[hg];B[je];W[if]C[LB> maybe aji kesh?

Why not O16 instead of J14?];B[ie]C[Isn't L15 a good idea for Black instead of J15?]
;W[pf]C[LB> bottom corner bigger?  or approach at O17?  I was trying to play lightly (something I am _very_ bad at.)

O17 is better. Then Black has to look after his J15 stones
and to worry about the corner. White should be able to get
sente to play around Q4.];B[md];W[pp];B[co];W[fp]C[LB>  I would usually play a pincer, but I was trying to play more reasonable.]
;B[dj];W[cm]C[LB> C4 better?

Yes, White does not know what he wants. First the exchange
F4, D10 strengthens the black position, then white plunges in.
That is bad style. If white is going to play a pincer he should
do so emediatly.];B[cq];W[cr];B[dp];W[eq];B[bq];W[jq]C[LB> I feel like my C7 stone was wasted.

Wasted is a big word. :-)

Something like E6 might be better than K3.   But if Black is going to invest another move to capture C7
that would feel slow and white might be back in the game
after a move like Q11.];B[fc]C[F17 is small. R6 is better.];W[ed];B[gd]
;W[ig];B[ke];W[od]C[LB> trying to use L16 aji

This is bad. White is fighting in Blacks svere of influence.
I would prefer Q11.];B[oc];W[pc];B[qd];W[nc];B[ob];W[nd];B[pb];W[lc];B[ld]
;W[mc];B[kc];W[kb];B[jc];W[jb];B[ic];W[pe]C[LB> Who got better result?

This looks not bad for White. Black should have played more
forcefull. Maybe Black should have choosen a variation in
which he seperates Q14.];B[mf]C[To slow];W[pn];B[nq];W[pq];B[lq];W[jo];B
[mn];W[em];B[br];W[fn]C[LB> Suddenly I feel like I have the lead.

White is not bad now. Moves like N14 and B2 seem to indicate
that Black is too frightened. Instead of B2 Black should try
to seperate white with E5. He could then hope for an attack
against the weak White stones around G13.];B[bm]C[Not importand. Black has very solid positions around the board.
He has to attack the two white groups at the top.];W[cl]C[Better something like G10]
;B[bn];W[cj];B[di];W[bj];B[bh];W[qk]C[LB> Trying to secure territory

More importand is securing the two weak groups. :-)];B[qi]C[Q12 is better. The theme i not to reduce white territory but
to attack the white group.];W[qe];B[qc];W[oi];B[pj];W[oj];B[pk];W[ql];B

You mean the M8 cut? This looks natural.];W[li];B[mj];W[kk];B[jl];W[lh]

C[LB> with my groups connected, I feel happy.

Yes, Black didn't grap is chance to attack the white groups.

Now Black can not give the komi.  Wasm't this whites strategy? :-)];B[mk]
