C[Hi there! This game was played with me taking white, and even though black eventually resigned, I felt that for half the time, I wasn't sure what was going on, so I would appreciate as many comments as possible should you feel that the area can be improved upon.  As the game will show, I was unable to build territory and moyos well, so I was wondering if you could give me comments and advice about it in the context of this match.

I think you don't get moyo's or territory because you don't aim for them with the usual corner enclosures and extensions. A book on opening theory might help. You are also correct in your assessment of wasted moves. Often times these can be used to step back and make a big play for territory. Black gave away a won game. Even if he had not killed the big white group in the center, he would have won if he had walled white off and quietly taken his share of the center. He was way ahead on the edges. I also have a feeling that both sides are not always aware of when a cut will create a serious weakness.]
;B[jj]C[
An unusual move, but I sometimes see better players than I make a move like this, perhaps to get away from standard lines. Violates the opening principle of corners, then sides, then center.]
;W[oe]C[
Same comment applies here. This is almost not a corner move.]

First ordinary move of the game.];B[cc];W[dd];B[dc]
(;W[cd]C[
joseki is shown as alternate. If w made a mistake here, this move might be it. I am not sure]
;B[ed];W[df]TR[ed]LB[cg:A]C[I think that the extension here was a little too small, but I wasn't sure where I should have played instead.

You might need to make a narrow extension given the triangle hane, but A might be worth a try.]
;B[pd];W[jk]LB[pj:A][jp:B][dq:C][ep:D][pe:E][qf:F]C[
Some of the earlier moves are unorthodox, but this move seems to be a mistake. Contact moves are usually made as defensive plays or as a "leaning" play to build up strength for an attack in the opposite direction, or to probe a corner or a side. This move doesn't seem to have any of those meanings. A-F are moves that I would think of.]
;B[kk];W[ik];B[od];W[nd]C[
Not sure about this move.];B[pe]TR[pp]C[
This is a point that w would have liked to play on because it faces his triangle stone]
;W[ne]TR[ed][dc][cc][jj][kk]C[
Look at the upper right now. b has the makings of a big corner and w should be getting compensating influence on the side or in the center. However, b's triangle stones seem to remove some of the value of that influence. w seems behind in this corner probably due to a combination effects from the unorthodox opening move, the contact play in the center and the direction chosen for play in the corner.]
;B[pg];W[id];B[hc];W[ic];B[nc];W[mc];B[lc]LB[mb:A]C[I didn't know how to respond to this move, and eventually ended up losing the three seeds. Where do you think I should have played ? (Locally or elsewhere ?)

It seems to me that a play at A will give you 2 reletively strong stones that you can use to fight back. I explore some lines from this in the alternates. The fighting is a little complicated and there maybe other possibilities for both sides.]

(;W[nb];B[oc]
(;W[lb]C[
See alternate.];B[md]C[
This move is good in that it separates w's position into pieces, one of which turns out to be weak.]

;W[rc];B[re];W[pb];B[ob];W[oa];B[qc];W[qb];B[rd];W[pc]C[
This move is too small. It doesn't really threaten b's position or help w's.]
;B[qn]LB[ql:A][pn:B][np:C]C[In view of black being able to build a large moyo on the right, how should I have responded to this move ? (Ignoring the fact that I wasted the next move)

This is a hard question. You probably wanted to prevent this by playing your previous move differently, b's point here would have been good.
 A pincer at A is probably too close to b's thickness above. A contact move at B might hold his moyo to a smaller size. Maybe you just want to play at C or elsewhere entirely and look for a chance to reduce the moyo later.]

I agree.];B[np];W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qo];W[ok];B[qk];W[om];B[pl]
;W[pj];B[ol];W[nl];B[pk];W[nj]
(;B[qj]LB[nm:A]C[
The cutting point at A is big. I am not sure that b should play there yet, but if w protects it and gets eyes for his group, b's formerly huge moyo is largely gone.]

;B[ee];W[kq]LB[jq:A][iq:B][jp:C]C[
This is not a brilliant move, but w is trying to build a moyo here and b should have stopped it earlier by playing an extension around A-C. It would then be hard to see how w could stay in the game.]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[bd]C[I was repeatedly forced into bad shapes, probably due to my lack of foresight, thus a lot of my eventual moves were to attempt to balance out such moves]

;W[jq];B[jr];W[ir];B[ko]C[When black played this, I realised that he was threatening my group on the right, however, I thought that I had to block still because I was behind in territory. Do you think that I should have played differently here ?

I guess not because this move ends up working. b has big time dual threats against you and the loss of your right group would be catastrophic, but if you don't get some territory it won't do you any good to save it. Now is the time to take big risks and hope for the best.]
;W[jo];B[mo];W[nh];B[ng]LB[mk:A][lh:B]TR[kk][jj][mf][me][md]
[le]C[
I don't know if b can kill the w group for sure, but this is not the way to try. I would start with A and then work to fence him in with moves like B and try to hold him to one eye. If this works the game is over. A and B will reinforce and tie together the triangle stones, making the attack more likely to succeed.]

This is a good move. w is looking like getting 2 eyes.];B[lj]

b needs to save at least 1 of his 2 center groups. At this point, I think he can win by playing A followed by connecting the triangled stones to the top.]

The game seems real close to me. I did a rough completion and got w 99 b 102. Getting discouraged by a big capture is an easy mistake to make.]
