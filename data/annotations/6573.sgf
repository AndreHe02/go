C[Seen my last few games I have problems with converting a influence into territory or chasing weak groups of opponents and simple getting territory.

At the beginning of the game I give too much territory to my opponent (without any real weak group) and not getting enough in return.


This game is simptomatic on how my last 5 games went (also games with over 1  h time pp) and lost them all.

Any help on where and how to improve are welcome.

I am playing white.


Empiror: a sense of balance has to be developed for any serious weiqi player, the sense to know if you are behind or ahead and the margin. It's not an easy sense to develop but  it's something that you can't get to higher level without.]

emp: w's 10 was not good if w didn't mean to continue with G4 and so on, because now, B's G4 will be of huge strategical value.]

(;B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[cf]LB[gc:C][bj:B][dj:A]C[Now I did not know what to, move at E17 was a bit slack and gave black the change to reinforce himself. Now also it lloks like a is not perfectly situated. with B black is almost alive.

Is at C cutting better ?

emp: E17 is fine, since it's w's backyard, no haste to kill a few stones, it's good to let ur target get bigger before u mount attack.]

emp: w 32 in wrong direction.];B[jd];W[oc]LB[mc:B][nc:A]C[Better at A , also because black's answer (B) strenghtens black's group on the left perfectly.

empiror: lower right is empty, much bigger than 34 or A or B]

;W[ln];B[lp];W[jo];B[ej]LB[ij:A]C[Since I do not have a real change to kill black better to grap territory by A ??

Although I counted for black roughly 70 points. and white needs to make 40 points in the centre and with A this will be 25 points max.

emp: points at centre are harder to make, never count on that untill you are really strong.]
