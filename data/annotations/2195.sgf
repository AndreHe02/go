[ep][fp][gp][hp][ip][kp][lp][mp][np][op]C[I'm hoping to get a second look at this game. It was between myself (20 kyu) and azazel 1 dan. Azazel went over my mistakes with me, but I'd like a second look simply because it enrages me so much that I managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of almost certain victory. I'd like to make sure I don't miss a single mistake on this game.

Reviewer> In a 9 stone handicap game think of your stones as connected along these lines. It's white's mission to disrupt these lines and split you into more groups.]
;W[mp]LB[pn:A][qn:B]C[Reviewer> A pretty standard start for White - he's expecting you to play 'A' or 'B', but  he's also aiming at your k4 stone.

Note how one of your lines has already been disrupted, but hey this will happen - the trick is not to make white strong by hitting him]

(;B[np]LB[pn:A][qn:B]C[Reviewer> White's strength is fighting (he's 1d after all). Your strength is the number of your stones, but your stones
can only work effectively if they remain connected, this is why A or B is good since it reinforces one of your lines.

Making contact is spoiling for a fight - both stones have 3 liberties and it's whites move next, so he'll probably add a stone to n4 to increase its liberties or rise to your challenge and fight you. You are behind in this fight because you started it - it is white's turn next so his stones will always equal or outnumber yours. So by "hitting" a stone you'll end up makng it stronger - exactly the opposite of what you want.

The best advice is to play to your own strengths - advice which moves like 'A' or 'B' suit.]
;W[no]LB[nn:B][oo:A]C[Reviewer> W is probably expecting 'A' next, so he can extend to 'B@]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[mr];W[lr];B[nr]C[You've walled off a 15 point corner (so far), but white's wall facing your weak positions looks better]
;W[fp]C[Reviewer> you protected the corner, but by forcing white to re-inforce his n4 stone you've weakened k4 it is a real target - W is secretly hoping you do the same again then taking K4 should be a breeze]
;B[fq]C[Azazel pointed out that E3 then c6 would've been a better move, and I can see it plainly now. My orignal idea was to try to keep him away from the edge and possibly cut him off from the group thats starting to form on the other corner.]
;W[gq];B[ep]C[Really bad setup for me, I can see, but still defendable]
;W[jn]TR[gp]SQ[go][ho][io][jo][ko][lo][hp][ip][kp][lp][hq][iq]
[jq][kq][lq][hr][ir][jr][kr][hs][is][js][ks]C[Reviewer> W now has ~26 points (if k4 dies) - not a bad start (after 13 moves), and you've got 2 fifteen point corners

NB: This will also serve as a base from which W can launch attacks elsewhere on the board.

But ... you can save K4 or at least attempt to save it

Reviewer> W has a weak point (triangle) he desperately wants to patch up, but it's your turn]

(;B[fo]TR[gp]C[Reviewer> This is a "thankyou move"];W[gp]TR[gp]
C[Reviewer> W says "thankyou now my weakness has gone"];B[fm]
LB[fd:A][nd:C][df:B][pf:D][pn:E]C[Pointless move, but I couldn't really think up a good response to k6. any suggestions?

Reviewer> See earlier - before patching up G4 there were more possibilities g4 or h5

F7 is a bit high - far from the edge of the board, W can still get in there if he really wants - better to strengthen another of your lines (any of A through E springs to mind)]
;W[qf]C[Reviewer> W has decided there are more fish to fry- he's got good profit on the bottom and wants to stop you securing the rest of the board]
;B[qe]C[Reviewer> Good standard reply];W[pf]LB[nd:A]C[Reviewer> W has to answer this way - O16 next]

(;B[rf]LB[nd:A]C[Again, o16. just like the bottom left corner. Least I learned one thing from this game :P

Reviewer> Yep O16];W[od]TR[ed][fd][gd][hd][id][de][je][df][jf]
[dg][jg][dh][jh][di][ji][ej][fj][gj][hj][ij][kj][lj][nj][oj]
[dk][pk][dl][pl][dm][dn][pn][do][po]C[Reviewer> 7 lines out of 12 left - NB some are weaker than others due to the presence of nearby W stones]
;B[pc];W[oc]LB[lc:A][ld:B]C[Reviewer> You're shut into that corner now, and W can extend to A or B to settle himself]
;B[ob];W[pe];B[rd]C[Not sure if this was a good idea or not. I've just become incredibly paranoid when it comes to cutting points.

Reviewer> Given that you're shut into the corner it's a good idea]
;W[gd]LB[cf:C][df:B][jf:A]TR[oc][od][pe][pf]C[Reviewer> The strong white wall on the right works well with this move to weaken k16, but this move also works well against the D16 stone - you have two options: -

1) Jump the threatened k16 stone into the centre 'A' allowing W to make a double approach move on D16
2) Jump to 'B' or 'C' strengthening the side

Ideally both :-)];B[fc]C[Reviewer> Again rushing into a fight - playing to Whites strength]
;W[nb]LB[cf:C][df:B][jf:A]C[Reviewer> Still 'A', 'B', or 'C' next]

(;B[pa]SQ[qa][ra][sa][pb][qb][rb][sb][qc][rc][sc][qd][sd][re]
[se]C[Reviewer> Think about this ... What is white threatening?

Can he kill the corner? - No
Can he take one stone? - Yes
How much is that worth?

You have 14 points here

in the alternate path you've lost 5 points, BUT in the alternate path you have sealed off more of the right - getting better potential for your stones. The top left is sealed in - these stones can't make you any more territory.

If you're worried about them dying - read ahead a little way and if you're sure you can live take more profit elsewhere.]
;W[gc];B[gb];W[hb]
(;B[fa]TR[eb]SQ[fb]C[Reviewer> F18 is usually better, sine the peep at e18 isn't a problem]

(;W[if]TR[de][df][dh][di][ej][fj][hj][ij][kj][lj][nj][oj][dk]
[pk][dl][pl][dm][dn][pn][do][po]C[Reviewer> Remember how you were unsure what to do about k6? - well this is the same - except the most open area lies in the direction of white's strong wall. Jumping out to k14 earlier would have been better

Whites mission to disrupt your lines is progressing well - I expect W will play B16, D13 or C14 soon]
;B[ib];W[fd]C[Reviewer> I expect this seemed a bit strange to you? what's white's game?

he obviously thinks ... if you take h18 I can handle that by threatening f17, etc... and then taking the corner]
;B[ec]C[in hindsight, I guess I should;ve ignored his probe and cut at h17]
;W[ha]C[Reviewer> So White made a move in sente *then* protected - good practice white has strengthend his position on the left now]
;B[hc];W[ic];B[hd];W[id];B[he];W[jb]SQ[ie]C[Reviewer> Now its your turn to make a threat before protecting ... playing at the position marked with a square will allow you to save the K16 stone]

(;B[jc]C[Reviewer> another "thankyou" move];W[ie];B[kb];W[ia]
;B[mb];W[nc]C[Reviewer> Not sure about this move ...];B[na]
;W[lc];B[lb];W[ld];B[kc];W[bd]TR[df]C[Reviewer> There's a weak point in your formation - a stone at the triangle marked position would have helped in the coming fight]
;B[ce];W[be];B[cc];W[cf];B[df]C[Reviewer> If this stone were already in place you could play C13 so W is unlikely to want to play C14]
;W[cg];B[ch];W[dg]C[Reviewer> Quick stock take -   W has a group at the bottom, one at the top and is starting a position on the right side, on the left he has a couple of stones influencing down to about QR11 weakening Q10 in combination with O5. Also three stones at f16 etc which can be captured (sacrificed). 3 groups

B has a group in each corner and a few remaining unconnected handicap stones. 4 or more groups

White has been trying to separate Black's handicap stones so he can attack them individually.

If White can attack two or more weak groups simultaneously then one could crumble, but more importantly W can make profit whilst attacking these weak targets

NB: Life/Death of W G16 group and B H17 group depends on G14 whoever plays there captures the other - worth 12 points - still an end-game move though.]
;B[eg]C[Reviewer> This "ladder" doesn't work it just weakens your positoins]
;W[dh];B[ee]C[Reviewer> So you need to come back and defend one group...]
;W[gf]C[Reviewer> This move has just become bigger than 12 points since if you take it you get 12 points but if W takes it he gets 6 points a total difference of 18 points. Good timing by W]
;B[di]C[Reviewer> ... and you get to protect both sides];W[bp]
C[Reviewer> another dual purpose move, W can go for the corner or the side - F7 was too high]
;B[co]C[Reviewer> You're letting W have the corner - this move says "I'm going to seal you in and take the outside" a good strategy]
;W[cq]
(;B[dq]TR[dr][er][fr][ds][es][fs]SQ[cr]C[Reviewer> This move says - "No you can't have the corner", but the squared position will get W the corner, and the squared positions are worthless to both sides]
;W[bo];B[bn]C[Reviewer> "You can't have the side either"];W[cr]
;B[dn]TR[bp][cq][cr]C[Reviewer> These marked stones are called the "tripod group" they are unconditionally alive

By changing strategy with every move you have lost more than you should have. You need a consistent strategy (note I don't say fixed - you still have to be adaptive in your strategy)]
;W[bh];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj];W[bc];B[bb];W[rp]TR[qq][qr]C[Reviewer> White's groups are all fairly settled so he can afford to go after another corner/side strategy - he can make the tripod group again if pushed.

Worth noting is that White has invaded at the same point in each of the three corners, and in each of those corners you rushed into attacking the approach move rather than playing q6, d6 and d14.]
;B[qp];W[qo]C[White wodul really like to seal you into the corner ~13 points so he can play N10 or O10 and get the right side.]
;B[rq];W[rn];B[sp]C[Reviewer> W is happy to give up one stone in order to make profit elsewhere S3 is unimportant]
;W[mn];B[qh]C[Reviewer> Right idea - that stone looked awful lonely]

(;B[ks];W[js]
(;B[ms];W[ab];B[cb];W[hk]C[Reviewer> What is this stone aiming at?]
;B[gk]C[Reviewer> This kicks white into building strength to cut off K10]
;W[hj];B[gj];W[il]C[Reviewer> Notice how W avoids making contact with your stones - in particular the ones he's attacking

When you touch a stone it is a crisis move and the usual response is for your opponent to reinforce their weak stone making it stronger ... so "don't touch stones you wnat to attack" - bear this in mind and look at the first few moves of the game again and see how you forced white to become strong.]
;B[hl];W[eh]C[should've closed off that point a long time ago. too late now]
;B[ei];W[ba];B[ca];W[ga];B[fb];W[db]TR[da][ea][db][eb][dc]C[Reviewer> Ouch! you need another eye - urgently - white has hit your vital point]

;W[ac];B[cd]C[should've gone to e16. I see that now.];W[ff]
;B[ef];W[ed];B[de];W[fg]C[and here I resigned. Sad, isn't it?

Reviewer> At least you've got a good sense of humor :-)

Things to learn from this game: -

a) In handicap games play to your strengths - avoid fights in particular don't start them unless you're in a strong position.
b) Connect your stones together - make them work as one. More groups are harder to defend against dual prupose attacks.
c) Play a consistent strategy... chopping and changing like in the lower left will be worse in the long run. Though you also need to be flexible.
d) Automatic ataris, eg T4 might not be answered because there are more points to be made elsewhere
e) Automatic defences (O18,Q19) might not be the best move at the current time for the same reason

I hope you found this review helpful and enjoy your future games.]
