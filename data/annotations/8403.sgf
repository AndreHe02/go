C[hi , my name is Mythical and my comments will begin with [M\]:

from what i've seen in your game your biggest problems are reading and leaving weak shapes.


in the beginning of the game you let opponent get good result which affected the rest of your game , so the problem was you didnt read enough.

your second problem was the weak shapes you left over and over , stronger player will always attack weak shapes when he has the chance.
you should try keep your groups strong and connected - dont make it easy for oponnent to attack you.

also , you sometimes attack before you defend .
think about life first , keep your groups safe !
thats the key for you to getting to the next level.

i hope i helped you .]
(;B[pq]C[SailorSam [6k\]: hi enjoy];W[dd]C[stndtrkyns [7k\]: glhf]
;B[cp];W[pc];B[qe];W[qg];B[oe];W[qd]C[[M\]:in situation like this where you dont know how exacly to respond to get reasonable result , i'd suggest to take few minutes to read possible continuations .
because as in your game, making a mess in the beginning of the game will make the game a lot harder than it should be.]
(;B[pd]C[[M\]: this is a bad move , since it lets white to fix her shape and black doesnt get anything good in return , and instead it leaves black with weak spots of his own .]
;W[qc]C[[M\]: white plays solid with no weaknesses to her shape what so ever , and black has very weak shape.
white will definetly get some profit attacking this group.]
(;B[oc];W[re]SQ[pf][nd]C[[M\]: now white is connected and is solid , while black has a group with many weaknesses which white could attack.]
(;B[rf]C[[M\]: you should be able to see/read these things , clearly it doesnt works.]
;W[qf];B[pe];W[rd];B[qh]C[thought this was a good move

[M\]: sometimes its good move , and good that you know it since it can be useful.
in this situation i think you should use it as a probe , just to see how white would reply - meaning use this move lightly .]
;W[rg]
(;B[ph]C[maybe P12 better?

[M\]: Q 12 is trying to surround white , but before you do it , try to read if it will work or will give you problems.

p 12 is not good (see variation)
i would just play L 16 (see variation)];W[pg];B[og];W[oh];B[rh]

(;B[le]C[[M\]: must live first , leave this thing for later .

this is also important part in getting stronger , you must try and find right timing for moves like this.
you are still not alive and and already trying to cut him.
most chances this will not work now , so not only that you leave your group weak , but also you ruin your chance to use this move later (when you make your group alive).
if white fixes his shape before you can use this move , then atleast you will have sente , maaning you can decide how the game will continue.]
;W[lf];B[ke];W[lg]
(;B[mh];W[mb]C[[M\]: now black is dead  :(

either way now , you cant expect good result in this area.
white has many points and a lot of influence towards the center and the top area.]

(;B[jh]C[[M\]: this doesnt works .

there is a proverb (sort of) , dont attack when you are weak , make yourself strong first .

happens to the best of us...

;B[gk];W[nd];B[hi];W[od];B[cf]C[[M\]: first you have to fix weaknesses .
the key to become stronger is to try and keep your groups strong.
if you have weakness fix it (preferebly with good shape)
if oponent has weakness attack it.]
(;W[fc]C[[M\]: im not sure if this good move by white , he gives you the time to fix your weaknesses , i would probably attack right away.]
