C[Hi, thanks for reviewing.  I'm white in this game.   This was a fun game.  Lots of killing.  :)

I'm experimenting with this fuseki right now.  A 3-3 with a parallel non facing komoku.  I've gotten some 13 straight wins so far with it, so I'm pretty happy with the results so far.  It works best when I'm black since I can make the corner shimari with the komoku stone right away assuming the opponent takes the 4th corner.

>>You did very well during the middle game/end game. You will find that my review is more on the opening/early middle game.]
;B[pd];W[cq];B[dp]C[I hate seeing this move when I play 3-3.  Assuming the joseki is followed, white gets pressed down and black gets a lot of center influence.

>>I'm not a fan of the 3-3 opening move but it is certain that you trade influence for territory when you play that move so it is to be expected that black will use that advantage and you will have to attack harder later on.]

(;W[cp];B[dq]C[lucky for me black doesn't follow joseki and I can now hane.]

(;W[qb];B[pb];W[in]C[i guess the corner was not secure yet since it ended up dead in the end.  Still, I think this move was pretty large too.]

(;W[gi]C[I wasn't sure how to expand my moyo even more.  e12 seemed too greedy.  I thought about f12, but I went with the safer move.

thanks again for reviewing!

My pleasure but then again, you played very well and better than he did so I don't have a big review, sorry about that :\ Moreover you already reviewed a lot of your mistakes in the middlegame/endgame so I don't have much to say. I hope I helped in the fuseki/chuban however :)]
