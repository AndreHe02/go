;B[pd]C[I had just finished beating owen in the last game... he lost early in a big fight.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[ec]C[I seem to do better when I do something like this rather than q10.

-E17 is a good move.   -Q10 is a specialized opening called "Sanren-sei".  The idea of Sanren-sei is to set up a very large moyo (territorial framework) and force your opponent to invade it, which leads to fierce fights.]
;W[df];B[hd]CR[hc][ic]C[Next time I think this will be h17

- yes, H17 and J17 are the usual joseki responses, although I don't really see anything wrong with the move you made.  I'm sure to a better player, however, the joseki moves are better.]
;W[di];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc]C[q 14 seems good, but then W l17...  would be okay if #7 was h17 ??

This move is bad news for later....

- M17 looks perfect to me.  If a problem develops later, it must be the fault of a later error.]
;W[qc]C[I am usually very happy for this situation]
(;B[pc]C[- Ok, with move 9, you set up the sanren-sei.  The object is to make a huge moyo.  This 3-3 invasion helps you, but you are blocking the wrong side, which simply drives white exactly where you want to set up your moyo.  Look what happens if you go the other way (variation 2).]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[pf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qg];B[cn]
CR[fq]C[- I think I would have prefered the other side.  Why take the small space when you can take the large one?  Why fight from a disadvantage?]
;W[cl]C[The pincer now solidifies the top left for white and black has a very severly attacked stone.]
;B[eo]CR[fp][fq]C[strange move?

my plan was to make a wall on e line...
whether or not that was a good plan, and  whether this move was right is another thing

- the knights move is for attacking.  The single space jump is for running.  You are much too weak here to attack.  If you wanted the bottom side, you should have approached from that side in the first place.  If you still value it more than #23, perhaps you would like to try a counter pincer at F4 or perhaps F3.]

[aq][bq][cq][ap][bp][cp][co][bo][ao][an][bn][cn][dn][cm][bm]
[am][bl][al][cr][cs]C[Your loss on the lower left is quite huge here.  This is really where you fell behind in the game.  Your 3 stone wall is only worth about 6 points, and it's going to be gote since you still need to get an extension around J4 or K4 to get that value.]
;B[jp];W[gp]C[I guess i asked for this

- not really.  I might have considered a closer extension due to the weakness of your wall (only 4 liberties on the wall), but you should be able to deal with this stone.]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[er];W[co];B[fn];W[em];B[go]C[-good];W[nq];B[oq]
C[This is what I usually do in this situation
Because of k4 and q10

- it is natural with K4 in place.  I think it's fine.  White is invading.  You should not try to kill him so much as to get some kind of profit out of his struggle to survive.]
;W[np];B[pn];W[kq]C[- I think white is overreaching himself here.  Contacting your stone at K4 just helps you.  Play at M3 or M4 would be better.]
;B[jq]C[This is what i expected

- good response.];W[ho]C[Oh no ...

-you are strong on both sides now.  You should attack the weak stone.  Don't let white separate your groups!  See variation 2.]

(;B[hn];W[io];B[jo];W[in]C[Ok, white has escaped.  your priority now is to not get surrounded.]
;B[hp]C[This move aims to capture a stone, but doesn't keep your groups separated, and allows white to cut you in half and then surround your group forcing you to live in gote.  I think G2 would connect your groups.]
;W[ip];B[hq];W[iq];B[hr];W[ir]C[- very painful.];B[jr];W[hs]
C[This hurt... I didnt know what to do with the stones on the k line now]
;B[gr];W[hm];B[lo]C[- good.];W[nn];B[kl];W[jn];B[kn];W[pm];B[on]
;W[om];B[nm]C[I am usually pretty aggressive and even make stronger players 'sweat' for a while..

Although I attack hard, I end up having a lot of weaknesses myself...

Maybe it is better here to do something like o10

- No, I think this was appropriate at this point.  White looks weaker than black and launching an attack at Q7 was over-reaching.]
;W[mm]C[Opportunity!  Why not just take a profit now?  See variation 2.]

(;B[nl];W[mn];B[ml];W[lm];B[km];W[ll];B[kk]C[-Now your groups are cut apart and the K5 group has no eyes, so will have to live in the middle.    In addition, the black stones in the corner are still open to invasion, at which point they will become weak.  And the stones in the mid right are also likely to come under attack.]
;W[lk];B[nj];W[lj];B[ik];W[gn];B[fo];W[fm];B[gs]C[I don't know if this was appropriate here.
There is no way w is going to ignore this

-yes, your group was in danger of dying without this move.  Very good.]
;W[is];B[ji]C[good.  run for life.];W[ni];B[mj]C[-good];W[mi]

(;B[li]C[once again...

- yes, the problem is you attack with weak groups.  Or to put it differently, you get committed to killing things.  Don't seek to kill so much.  Rather, seek to take profit while attacking.

Strenthen your weak groups as your first priority.];W[ki];B[lh]
;W[kh];B[kj]C[right here i thought i was in good shape...

-well, I would say that you have started a fairly even fight.  Hard to say who will come out on top.]
;W[lg];B[mh];W[mg];B[nh];W[oi]C[- white came up with a nice counter attack here.]
;B[oj]C[- good];W[pg];B[oh]C[P13 would have been quite a bit better than P12.  It threatens to kill the three white stones without weakening your black stones on the right.]
;W[pi];B[og];W[qn];B[ql];W[qm];B[ph];W[qi];B[qh];W[qj];B[qk]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[ol];B[rj];W[po]C[- Wow, sooooo complicated!  This is why you want strong strong groups before trying to kill things.  All of your weaknesses can be used against you.]
;B[oo]C[hmm r5 gives only one eye... do i live in the corner?]
;W[op];B[qo];W[no];B[pq]C[Living was probably a good idea here.]
;W[po];B[ro];W[kp];B[ko];W[lp];B[jh];W[kg]
(;B[ff]C[I thought i was REALLY good here....

- wellll, you haven't finished protecting your middle group.  The white stones at L13 are cutting your groups apart, and they are pretty weak right now.  They are a priority to kill if possible.  Since they only have 5 liberties and are surrounded by black stones, it should be possible.]
;W[nb];B[oa];W[kc]C[Here it goes... this happens a lot...

-pay attention to your weak groups.  That is what makes surprises like this possible.]
;B[ld];W[kd];B[le];W[ke];B[lb];W[gd];B[hc]CR[he]C[go the other way.  You may have to give something up.  It would be better to let white get something on the top rather than the whole bottom.]
