;B[pp];W[dp];B[dc];W[pd];B[gq];W[eq];B[jq]C[K3 seems a little low. I prefer  K4 here or even L4 if you don't mind W  J3]
;W[qn];B[nq];W[qk];B[qo];W[pn]C[Good for B as W is a little overconcentrated here]
;B[ro]C[Small, W should ignore];W[rn];B[cj];W[cl];B[jd];W[kc]
;B[jc];W[nc]C[O17 is too submissive, I prefer  L16 for W here]
;B[ce]C[It is now clear that B C10 was too low, would have been better at D10  perhaps]
;W[cb]C[W would better reduce at D11 or at E15. Invasions at C12 or F16   are  also ideas]
;B[cc];W[el];B[ej];W[dg]C[W D13 or hereabouts is better before the E8/E10 exchange. Don't induce  opponent to strength his/her moyo before you plan to invade. :-)]
;B[dh];W[eg]C[B's goal is to make W heavy and chase these stones while making some  territory and building influence to reduce White's right side]
;B[eh];W[fg];B[gi];W[hg]C[W should be jumping down to E16 before B strengthens upper left]
;B[ge]C[Good, keeps W from erasing this area];W[ee];B[fd];W[fe]
;B[gf]C[Maybe better at E16];W[ed];B[fc]C[I would play B at E17 and accept the fight. W gets too many threats  with E17 next]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[gg];B[cg];W[cf];B[de]C[B needs to play at B14 as cannot cut the bamboo joint (EF14). Now W  can cut with B13 and later at G16, F18, D18]
;W[bg];B[ch];W[df];B[ff]C[by filling in this liberty (when W replies at E14) B makes the cut at  G16 better. Perhaps better to play B12 and B18]
;W[ef];B[be];W[bf];B[if]C[The cut at D18 or F18 should work now]
;W[ig];B[db];W[hi]C[probably K14 now better for W than H11. W wants to secure large moyo in  upper right quadrant]
;B[hj];W[ii];B[qg]C[I would prefer Q13 for this invasion, a little higher. But this may be  OK also]

;W[ng];B[nf];W[qd]C[W S17 seems a little small, therefore slack]
;B[oe]C[Good for B, making some shape. Now W should look at P9 to net the  cutting stones, J10 to theaten the B group and broaden moyo, or K14 to capture  a stone, make eye shape, and threaten right  de B group]
;W[lh];B[jf]C[very important for B];W[kg];B[kf];W[ld];B[ok]
C[Good, W missed chance here to easily capture these];W[kk]
;B[ij];W[jj];B[hm];W[nm];B[dn]C[E6 may be good response for W, goal is to connect and not lose either  part of group here]
;W[cn];B[co];W[do];B[cm];W[bn];B[dm]C[W B7 captures 1 C5 and saves C8]

;B[il];W[jl];B[kp]C[B is well ahead, so big end game move, good]
