C[Hello!

It would be great if you could go through that game. Especially having the fuseki and first middle game moves analyzed would be important for me.

It seems that I always fall back in influence and I don't know really why.

I play aroud 21K and black in this game.];B[dd];W[op];B[pd]
;W[co];B[pn]C[q6 is in the right direction but maybe not the right point.

It is in the right direction because develop the q16 stone but probably at r5 would be better]
;W[po];B[on];W[qo];B[qn];W[no];B[oi]C[Not a very bad exchange for black but white have got a really large corner.

p11 is one line higher than needed, in my opinion, probably better at q11 making a white kakari at r14 more difficult.]
;W[dq];B[cf]C[c14 is a bad move now. It is very small.

Black have a lot of good moves now. k16 seems to be a very good point to make a really big moyo ( possible territory) at top.

Invading the bottom at j3 is also very big.];W[nc];B[oc]C[When you dont have a stone around k16 is not good to attach at p17, it helps white to get stronger.

Probably better to play a pincer at k16];W[nd];B[jc]C[Right idea but wrong order of moves like i have told you before.

You have now the two corner stones weak.];W[le];B[of]C[White have give you another opportunity to attack and you have take it, good :)]
;W[kg]C[Very loose for white, better at k15.

Invading at h17 is also possible but probably an overplay.]
;B[je]C[You take the vital point, good :)];W[ke];B[jd]C[Solid play, making a very good moyo at the top left.

The key point now, is how black attack the weak white group, not for killing it but for make territory or influence.

If black could invade at j3, the game clearly is in his hands.]
;W[kd]C[Very bad move for white, an empty triangle.];B[ge]C[Not very bad, but attacking at j13 seems better to me. This move only have one meaning, to make territory, and every move must try to do more.]
;W[dl];B[dj]C[Locally a good point, but this is not the important area to play now.

Better to attack the white group, or invade the bottom.];W[ck]
;B[cj];W[fl];B[fj]C[It seems that both players are happy with this exchange but black is still open at c17, so it is posible to reduce by a lot his corner territory]
;W[hk]C[this is the vital point for the two moyos, but black must invade.]
;B[hi];W[ij];B[ii];W[ji];B[ig]C[Black is happy to have close his moyo but he had a better move, to cut at k10 and show white that he still have a weak group.]
;W[jh];B[ih];W[jf];B[if];W[jg]C[unnecesary move for white.]
;B[mm]C[Locally a good point for black, but not enough.];W[ln]
;B[mn];W[mo];B[lm]C[Again the same, good local point but ...]
;W[kn];B[mj];W[km];B[kl];W[jl];B[kk];W[jk];B[kj];W[jj];B[mg]
;W[lh];B[mh];W[li];B[lj];W[mi];B[ni];W[mf];B[nf];W[oe];B[pe]
;W[ne];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[kc];B[kb]C[This is a endgame move and it is very early. Also it is gote ( lose the iniciative) and in the endgame is it very important to play sente (moves that the opponent must answer).]
;W[lb];B[jb];W[bj];B[bi];W[ak];B[bh];W[cc]C[The achilles heel of black corner :(]
;B[cd]C[Bad direction.

When you are faced with a 3-3 point invasion, you must block on the side of your longer extension. This time at d17 and white will have a lot of more problems to live and even if he could, you get a bigger territory.]
;W[dc];B[bc]C[Again the bad choice, white can easily live, so it is better to confine him to the corner and take all the outer territory. e17 was the move here.]
;W[bb];B[bd];W[ed]C[Too risky for white better at e17 because you could cut at e17 now]
;B[ec]C[Good :)];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb]C[Bad

You usually cant cut at the second line, unless you think of sacrifice that stone to achive something, but not here. Better simple to extend at g17.]
;W[gc]C[white shows you your mistake.];B[fd];W[hb];B[gd];W[ga]
;B[hc];W[gb];B[ab];W[ba];B[db];W[cb];B[da];W[ea];B[qq]C[Good move, but easier and bigger the invasion at j3.]
;W[ro]C[You have now two choices, to block at s6 and have your points or to play p2 and live at the top, but your right side territory will vanish.]
;B[rn];W[pq];B[pr]C[Not enough space to live here.];W[or];B[qr]
;W[rq];B[rp];W[qp];B[os];W[ns];B[ps];W[rr];B[ek]C[Just an endgame move.]
;W[el];B[dk];W[cl];B[oo];W[nn];B[nm];W[gj];B[gi];W[fk];B[hj]
;W[gk];B[ib];W[ia];B[lf];W[me];B[lg];W[kf];B[ki];W[kh];B[so]
;W[sp];B[sn];W[ca];B[ai];W[ka];B[ma];W[ja];B[hd];W[iq]C[One of the two players did notice that weak point at last.]
;B[aj];W[bk];B[na];W[la];B[ac];W[aa]C[Final commentary:

It seems to me that you were too much concerned about your own territory and too little about your opponent´s.

You played very solid and didnt make any evident mistake, but you dont take your opportunities, be cuts, invasions or long extensions.

I think that you must start to take a little more risks to improve your style and watch more closely the other player territory for defects and so on.

Of course, think of my commentaries only like ideas for improving but being myself only 9k*, i could be wrong. Also accept my apologies for my very bad english.]
