WR[10k*]HA[0]KM[5.5];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[fd]C[Jared:
Black D13 is no good.  White will play C16 immediately, forcing black into
an extremely overconcentrated position.  Black should play a joseki move
like C17, C12, C11, or H17.  C17 is an excellent move for kyu players, and
is useful in a variety of circumstances.  C11 is probably the best move
locally, but given the presence of Q16, H17 is a strong fighting
alternative.]
(;B[dg]
(;W[ci]C[White C11 misses the vital point, giving black  an option to play
C17 immediately.];B[ck]C[Black C9 also misses the vital point (still
C17).  Black's strategy is not good here.  Black is starting lots of
little fights in the area of the board where white is strong.  By creating
lots of weak groups, black will have problems later.  Better to seek one
stable group, then go looking for fights.  Or rather than fight, get sente
to play a big move like Q10.];W[ei]C[for black's next move, C6 seems
better than E9, to establish a base on the side.   If white gets a move
around here, the black stones around C9 will come under attack.  The white
stones in the middle are bordered on both sides by a weak black group, so
will have no problem taking care of themselves.  C6 also takes territory.
But black may not have time to play C6.  C17 seems urgent.  So we see that
C9 is a bad move.];B[ek]
(;W[ch]C[White C12 misses the point.  White should  take C16, the vital
point.  Take profit while attacking.  Besides black cannot cross under.
Black will get a bad result if black tries to cut at D11.];B[cc]C[Black
C17 excellent!
White C18 better than D16];W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B[df]
(;W[cg];B[cf]C[Since white  played C13 as a forcing move, white should be
consistent and take C18.    This is probably sente.  Otherwise leave C13
left unplayed.  IN any case,  B14 is probably a better forcing move than
C13.]
(;W[ej]C[White E10 is a completely wasted move that serves no purpose.   It
begs black to settle their stones by playing C6.  White should play C17 to
deprive black of a base *and* threaten to link to C11 *and* form a shimari
with D4.];B[dj]C[White should play D11 at E12 for a more efficient
connection.];W[di];B[cn]C[white D8 seems like a strange forcing move.
white is strengthening stones that can be used to attack white's group
around E11.  Remember: forcing moves waste ko threats.  One must choose
their timing very carefully.];W[dl];B[dk]C[Since white has played D8, I
think C8 must be played for consistency, starting a tough fight.  D6 begs
black to play C8, making the white stones look foolish and settling the
black group.]
(;W[dn]C[black should just play C8...]
(;B[dm];W[cm];B[em];W[co];B[cl];W[bn]C[white got off
easy...];B[gg]C[INGMAR: Is g 13 too far - or a better move instead?

G13 really hits the spot.  The black stones in the upper right corner are
alive, so black doesn't have too worry too much about connecting.  Besides
D18 is becoming stronger and stronger sente.  It can almost be played now,
particularly because it is sente for white as well (and thus double
sente.];W[gj]C[Black can play D18 now, or save it for later...]
(;B[gl];W[ij];B[ig];W[ic];B[il]C[I think white should just keep jumping.
This is a bad scene for white, but I see no alternative.  Black's attack
is good.]
(;W[ik]C[Extend!  K8!
J7 is cowardly and unnecessary.
What is the worry?]
(;B[im];W[pf]C[And what was white planning on doing if  black responded
with a pincer (maybe Q10 or Q11)?  White still has a weak group running
for the center.  M10 is probably correct.  If white is going to play on
the side, Q10 seems right.]
(;B[qe]C[R15 is terrible.  N17 seems acceptable,  or maybe a pincer as
discussed before.  O16 is possible];W[qf];B[re]C[S15??!??  What is this?
Tiny yose!  I think O16 is required instead of S15.]
(;W[qn];B[qh];W[rf];B[qk]C[See how white R6 was a terrible mistake.  There
is a tremendous difference between that and Q10.  Now black has developed
a terrific splitting attack.  White is bound to lose something, somewhere.
One bad move can make a tremendous difference in a game of go.  However,
in a low kyu game, the person who loses is usually the person who makes
the last mistake, so there may be many more surprises in store for us in
this game...];W[qi];B[pi];W[rh];B[ri]C[White doesn't know quite what to do
on the right side, so just takes a big point.  White's problem, however is
still the weak group. running from E11.  If white is not careful white
will lose this group, particularly now that black has power in the center
right.];W[jp]
(;B[lm]C[INGMAR: m7 the right move???

M7 seems fine, but R10 also seems pungent, extinguishing the white stone
and threatening the R14 stones as well as the white center
group.];W[om];B[pl]C[a strange fight develops, but white is at a
disadvantage throughout due to earlier strategy
mistakes...];W[ol];B[ok];W[qg];B[ph];W[np];B[oo];W[nn];B[on];W[mm];B[pm]
;W[rp];B[qo]C[All these moves in the lower right seem a
little off target as the main emphasis is on the weak white R14 group and
the weak white center group...];W[qr];B[ro];W[oq];B[md]C[N16 is an
excellent dual purpose move...];W[si];B[rj];W[nf];B[lf];W[pe];B[od];W[mg]
;B[lg];W[mh];B[ki];W[mj];B[kk]C[Now white's weak groups will haunt white.   White saves the left
side group but has no time to save the
right.];W[bj];B[bk];W[fh];B[fg];W[gh]C[The problem with G12 is that it
leaves a weakness at H11 that black may play now or later...
Also, black can attack by playing at F10, but maybe not quite yet.  It's a
hard read.]

(;B[mc]C[INGMAR:  n17 better on  m17??

Well, since black has an absolutely won game with the dead right side
white group, black will want to go for absolute safety.  The choice
between M17 and N17 doesn't seem to matter here.  M17 seems slightly
better from a yose standpoint.]
