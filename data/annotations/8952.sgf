C[[Eloriot\] Hello, I am going to review this game for black. I hope you find my review helpful :).]
;B[pp];W[cc];B[dp];W[qc];B[iq];W[jc]
(;B[ce]TR[jc]C[[Eloriot\] This approach does not seem like a good idea in this situation. Because of the marked stone, white is very comfortable with extending to E16, while you do not gain much.
You might want to consider a shoulder hit in this situation (see variation).]
;W[ed];B[ch];W[nd]
(;B[qe]TR[jc]LB[pd:a][qi:b]C[[Eloriot\] I do not like this attack either. White at a will not only secure his position in the top right corner, but also put a lot of preassure on your stone.
As white has played the marked stone, you could either try to create a group somewhere around b, or attack directly (see variation).]
;W[mq];B[oq];W[jq];B[gp]LB[jp:a][jr:b]C[[Eloriot\] Do not be so afraid! Whites group is far from settled, and you should take the oppertunity of him attaching to attack his stones at a or b.]
;W[ir]C[[Eloriot\] If you do not attack, he will.];B[hr]C[This is a bad response right?... I realized it 2 seconds after playing. i have that bad habit of making fast responses.

[Eloriot\] I do not see anything wrong with this response. I prevents white from expanding at the bottom while still threatening his base.]
;W[is];B[ip];W[jp];B[dm]LB[cm:a]C[[Eloriot\] Please not that the bottom left corner is not yours at this point. Even if you played at a, I thin white could live with a 3-3-invasion, making your stones overconcentrated.]
;W[qk];B[qh];W[qn];B[rp];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[qj]LB[rj:a]C[More than territory, I expected secure life for those stones and put some pressure on his

[Eloriot\] Attaching here actually invites white to attack your stones (which he does). Furtheremore attacking always strenghens your opponent, so there is no preassure to be gained here.
Your intentions could be satisfied by playing on a instead.]
;W[pj];B[pi];W[oj];B[dj];W[jj]MA[kl][ll][ml][nl][ol][pl][nk]
[mk][lk][kk][ok][pk][pn][po][oo][no][mo][lo][ko][kn][km][lm]
[ln][mn][mm][nm][pm][om][on][nn]C[After this move, I wanted to reduce his influence around here... It worked well, but there were also bad responses from his side, so, I want to ask for antoher way of doing this that doesn't require the mistakes of my opponent

[Eloriot\] I think your approach was ok, even though there ara some issues I will cover later. At this point you should not worry too much about the marked area, so long as you make use of your group in the lower right corner and the huge gap on the left side of the area you marked.]
;B[lq]C[After the game, i realized that putting that stone on M4 would have been pretty good (at least I got that impression)

[Eloriot\] Both M3 and M4 seem to result in black running for its life depending on how white plays, but I might be wrong here.
If you do not hava a plan in which you kill or sacrifice this stone, you should focus on attacking in a way that is safe for your stones.]
;W[mp];B[jo]C[[Eloriot\] Beware of the consequences :). (See below)]
;W[ko];B[hs]TR[lq]C[[Eloriot\] A good move on its own, but it makes the marked stone utterly useless.]
;W[kr];B[jl]TR[jo][ko]CR[ll][jn]C[[Eloriot\] A very nice move, but too late. Had the marked stones not been exchanged, white moght play on one of the circles. If black takes the other one, the situation would look quite nice.]
;W[jn];B[io];W[in];B[ll]
(;W[kl]C[[Eloriot\] Maybe one of the "mistakes" you mentioned earlier.]
;B[km]C[[Eloriot\] Please not that I will not go into the fighting unless I see a big error.]
;W[kk];B[mm];W[jm];B[kn];W[ln];B[lm];W[il];B[hn];W[jk];B[lo]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[mo];W[ko];B[no];W[np];B[oo];W[op];B[pq]
LB[po:a]C[[Eloriot\] This is a big mistake. If you had just connected at a, your group would be safe, and you culd threaten to seperate and/or kill his groups on the right side. Furthermore this move does not seem to achieve anything.]
;W[po]C[[Eloriot\] White takes the oppertunity to cut.];B[on]
;W[nm]C[At this point I wasn´t so sure that i would be able to form 2 eyes... in the game I forgot about the Ko at L5. So I was just running and looking for a weak point on his walls

[Eloriot\] Well you should not be reliing on the Ko in either case. This is a big Ko, and Ko tend to get ugly fast.]
;B[om]LB[pm:a]C[[Eloriot\] If you run you have to be shure that you can either run away or try to make nice eyeshapes.
a is a nice options, but I will not go into the variations here. You might want to try it out for yourself.]
;W[nl];B[qm];W[rm];B[ql];W[rl];B[pk];W[rk];B[ol];W[ok];B[pn]
;W[pl];B[pm]C[Now I was just praying "Don't play S6"];W[lk]
C[[Eloriot\] You got very lucky :).];B[rn];W[ro];B[so];W[ml]
;B[mn];W[nr];B[or];W[ns];B[rj];W[sk];B[pk];W[oi];B[jf]LB[pl:a]
[ph:A][of:B][pg:C]C[I was thinking about escaping either right or left, so it seemed like a good idea]
;W[he]
(;B[hf]LB[id:a][ld:b]C[[Eloriot\] SInce you can not gain territory around here, you might not want to help settling white's top border. Throwing in moves at a or b will help you escape, as white has to respond.

This also is the last comment before the end, as I can not see any faulty ideas from here on.]

;W[ef];B[cf];W[de];B[lf];W[lh];B[ld];W[lc];B[kd]C[One last comment. I was affraid about a 3-3 invasion at C3, I don't handle well that invasion when I'm supposed to kill it. I know the Joseki, but in this situation, How should I respond a 3-3 invasion? Joseki or killing it?

Thanks a lot.

[Eloriot\] First of all, I do not think a 3-3-invasion can be killed if White plays correctly.
But even more importantly, if you are not shure about the corner just take it!
You might waste one move + one point, but the corner is quite big. Generally you should take time to defend your positions, if you are not shure you can deal with an invasion.

[Summary\] Judging from this game I think you should try remember the following things:
* Attaching/attacking strenghens both groups
* If a your opponent attaches, counterattack unless you have a  good reason not too (e.g. move 15)
* Try to seperate your opponents groups. In this game White had some very lose groups, and you could have taken more advantage of that.
* Remember holes (C3, Q12), Ko (L4, Q8) that might be important in the late game. Next time you might want to submit a finished game so one can help you one those points.

I hope this review helps you. If you have further questions feel free to contact me :).]
)
(;B[id]C[[Eloriot\] Again this is only one example of many possibilities. There are better moves for both sides depending on what you want, so I suggest you play around with it a bit.]
;W[hc];B[ie]))
(;W[il]))
(;B[pe];W[pd];B[qd];W[qe];B[rd];W[re];B[od];W[pc];B[pf]C[[Eloirot\] This development gets you into a big fight, so you have to see if it suits you.]
))
(;B[dd]
(;W[cd];B[de];W[eb]LB[ce:a][gd:b]C[[Eloriot\] This is a common joseki. You could
play to a gaining influnce on the left side like you did in your game or do the common move b, threatening to seperate whites stones above.]
)
(;W[dc];B[ed]LB[fc:a][cd:b][dh:A][ec:B]C[[Eloriot\] If white moves along the top, he is probably going for the jump at a or the turn at b. Those could be answered with A or B respectively, but of course there are many other variations possible.]
