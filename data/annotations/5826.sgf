AB[pd][dp]C[This game was played on DGS.

I was black, a weak 27 kyu, white was a 26 kyu.

R: Hi. I am Radu, go player mostly on LG but also DGS. I am around 10k on both, under the nickname rd21275.
I am happy to provide you some insides related to this game. I will try to provide variants and explanations as comments, for both Black and White moves, of course emphasizing the Black positions mostly.
I hope you'll enjoy it.

(;B[jj]C[K16 was my other choice, but I feared that white takes the center spot then and I'm already being pushed back. (see variation)

R: most of the times, the center is approached after the sides influences are established. Esp. in the case of oppenings like this, with ll stones on line four. I think k16 was more suitable. See variation.]
;W[kj]LB[fd:D][jd:A][nd:B][qf:C]TR[jk][jl][jm][jn]SQ[kk][kl]
[km][kn]C[R: bad attack. Rule (in fact advice) number xxx: defend in contact, don't attack in contact! Simple reason: attack in contact force the defender to enforce the weak group and that way gain strength on the attacker sente.
This attack is very bad because of:
- it allows B gain quickly strength in center
- it is providing smaller space than B stone (line L against line K - the middle)
- there are other bigger moves and K10 could be ignored.]
(;B[lj]LB[ji:E][ki:B][lj:A][jk:D][kk:C]TR[kj]C[Is L11 better?

I can't capture L10, but I wanted to seperate it a bit from Q10.

R: bad! Remeber that I commented the previous move. Not only that B doesn't use the advantage of poor W attack, but play what W will love to see. I would say that this would be the worst anwer :(
First of all, the W attack is to advantageous to B to be ignored. So a tenuki like K10, even it would be a big move, isn't so urgent.
Let's consider the five positions I marked.
E looks best, because it is starting line toward the open side and put pressure on W, which now has to consider an invasion at K10.
D also is good: make strength for B in center and W is trapped in low right area.
B and esp C are tricky bold moves. The sequence started on them could become complicated. Because ity is B in a game with handicap, the advice is to stay out of complication. W would love to go to sophisticated situation where W can use superior rank strength. But these 2 moves are perfect soundable for an even game.
Now the problem: A. For more details, please see the variation.]
;W[kk]
(;B[li]C[M10 is more in danger than K10, because it's on white's side, so I stretch on the right.

L11 would have given me more cutting points than I can defend, rigtht? (variation)

R: B has 2 groups not linked. B can choose: run for life with both or give up one and focus in gaining some compensation for the other. Personally I would choose second, see variation.]
;W[ki];B[kh]LB[jd:A]C[R: hane almost always is a good move. But in this case... I think not. Instead of this tactic fight, think rather to extend influence.
Because A is still not occupied, this is the actual aim. And now it becomes obvious the importance of K16 rather than K10.]
;W[ji];B[ij]C[R: 2 groups fighting for life, while W builds influence.]
;W[lk];B[mh];W[mj];B[jl]LB[jd:B][ig:D][gp:C][jp:A][mp:E]C[R: hmmmm, too close to the strong W group. That connection is weak, better J8.
Let's watch the whole board. While B has to be the major target, the direction chosen is wrong. And to make it worse, A is blocking the way to the side. The only opportunity there is C, so again J8 is more suitable. But considering the B as target and the need of putting more stones in center, D would work for both.
K8 could do some work for E, but too little because of W's center group.]
;W[kl];B[il]C[is J8 too much?

R: J8 should it be in the first case :) As I said, the direction is wrong, should go up instead down.]
;W[ih];B[gi]LB[jd:A][dj:C][il:B][dp:D]C[Trying to contain white somehow.

R: What this has to do with K16? A is the hotest spot! It is the biggest. Black group B is safe somehow, as it is facing both C and D.Now W has open way to A.]
;W[hg]C[R: Mistake, it allows B take K16.];B[gg]C[R: too small facing K16. And is in contact, with a strong W group!]
;W[gf]
(;B[hh]C[better cut?

R: good choice. It protects the cutting point and it is sente. But W has a good defensive at J14. It is only a pospone of taking K16. G13 shouldn't be there. K16 is the target.]
;W[if];B[jg]C[R: K16? W can ignore];W[ig];B[ph]C[R: good. K16 better.]
;W[jh];B[lg];W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[lf];W[ni];B[nh]C[Quite crowded, I don't really make a lot of territory, though I should be able tolive in the upper right corner.

R: M11 group is useless and values 4 points. Desconsider them. It is ok.]
;W[pi];B[ke]C[R: Why not classical K16? W groupd is alive and Very strong? Don't play in contact, don't offer aji.]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[je];B[kd]C[R: finally, upper side is occupied. The situation is not bad for B, W should now extend to the left upper corner.]
;W[fe]C[R: F16 looks better.];B[ic]LB[fe:A][cg:B][hq:C]C[Is that stupid?

I'm trying to push white a bit back, so that I keep the upper side.

R: A is obvious an attack on hoshi stone. And what is interesting at this attack is that it threats both upper and left side. B has little to protect on up side, but on left the B moyo is in danger.
Also, if B chooses tenuki, there are bigger points on table.]

(;W[ed]C[This white diagonal E16 to H13 and further on to M9 is a bit frightening, I won't be able to cut through.

R: it is a simple big group. Nothing frightening. Actually, W is a little too slow in the development. Look at the variant.]

(;B[ec]C[R: Left side is more important.];W[fc];B[db]C[I often do this and I think it's a mistake, right?

R: what is a mistake? If you refer to this move as defending the cutting point at D17, I think it is bad. In the corner, 3x3, 2x2 and 2x3 are the most important points, becuase them are providing the eyes for living. W has an important aji to use: C17. I am still thinking that B should protect teh moyo on left side: see variation started with move 48.]
;W[eb];B[dc]C[Because I need to fill here.

R: actually, W should give up so easy the aji at C17. W should leave the position as it is, go elswhere and later, when the time is proper, put the C17 threat to work.]
;W[fa]C[R: small move];B[gb];W[fb];B[ga]C[R: Best defense here: h18.]
;W[gc]
(;B[hc]C[I seemed to think that I can defend against the cut at H18...

R: Well, 4 points worthing. Instead G19, H18 would be better. But yes, B should now defend that stones.]

(;W[ha]C[R: well, there is a better way for W :)];B[gq]LB[df:A]

;B[ce];W[cf]
(;B[bd]C[defend cutting point at C16 and start making eyes.

R: how about the variation? It looks making larger profit.]
;W[jd];B[jc]C[save those three stones by trying to connect]
;W[da];B[ca];W[ea]C[R: B now has many worries about the C17 aji]
;B[bb]C[R: good.];W[oc]CR[ja][kc][le][qf]C[How do I defend here?

R: at a first glance, it looks as an useless attack. W is facing a black box in all directions. B can easily take the corner with Q17 or Q18. But...
There are too many aji left behind. Although W attacked a little too far, the circle points can be anytime used. And even the P17 dies, it accomplishes the aim: open the B moyo for the invaders.
Neglecting the aji, B should ban the corner. In corner there is the easiest life.]
;B[nc]C[R: but anyway: don't make a pincer in contact! P16 or Q17 ruin the B position.]

1. Aji: there are bad aji (circles), but defendable
2. Big points: letters];B[qq]C[R: not what I would expect!!!
ok, 3x3 invasions is good, when nothing else can be done! Otherwise, make attacks from open side, consolidate the own moyos, reduce opp's moyo.
Why this? Well, let's suppose (and have to) live there. Let's take a very usual development, look at the variation.]

(;W[oh]C[R: B can't ignore! But if W looses sente...];B[og]
;W[oi];B[pq]C[R: good, W actually lost sente! And yes, you chose very well the side. R4 would it be worse.]

;W[ir]
(;B[lr]C[Must ensure that white doesn't go to the right, making eyespace.

R: why?];W[fq]C[Okay, that's it. I'm losing this capturing race.

R: why?]
(;B[es]C[Hoping for a stupid mistake ;-)];W[fr]C[Well, that's it, no need to play any further.
R: I am sure you have a great power play. And the forced move like B7, like H18 and so on, these are easy moves. You'll learn them in short time and you'll end up making them as routine.
Let's count: if you would stop W at B6, not loose M12 group, and capture J3 group (without B3 the W wouldn't live there), you'd win big. B: 50 points in left bottom, 10 points in left up, 12 points in center, 50 points in bottom and right corner. Total: 112 points. W: 8 points in center, 5 points in left, 12 points in top right, 15 points in center. Total: 40.
What that means? Once you'll learn forced moves on the sides, your real power play would be around 18k.

Learn the closures on the sides. I can recommend an excellent introductory course:
http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/learn/go_cm1.html
There are 28 lessons for begginers and suplimentary a list of interseting articles for 5-10k like players.
Also, take a look at the materials at http://senseis.xmp.net
It won't take long and your play will improve very much.

(;B[jd];W[jj]C[In hindsight I think it would have been better.

White is concentrated in the lower right quadrant while I'm stretching out to the sides and can still meddle a bit in the upper right and left lower sides.

R: go is a game of balance. Suppose the game is ending now: W gained 25 points in center (L9-P9-P5L5), Black took 33 points (E19-E17-P17-P19).
Of course, this is only a rough estimation. Now, K16 doesn't make teritorry (nor K10), but as influence K16 is more important as K10 simply because it acts on the side (the suitable place to make life), supporting any group there, while K10 doesn't directly support life. K10 is more like a strategic move, for creating pressure on the sides, rather than creating a moyo.
BTW, as response to K16, I would rather choose F3 or symetrical R14: attack from open side.]
