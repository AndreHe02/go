Alch1m1s7 [11k\]: hi

H: Hello, I'm Hannes and will mark my comments with "H"


Summarizing, I think that
- Black did well in "standard situations" (like corner josekis) although he overlooked a ladder once.
- Black did spot the vital weakness in white's huge moyo and exploited it pretty well.
On the other hand, 
- Black several times lost sente without need
- Black tends to concentrate on the local occurrings, but should take the time to have a look at the "overall" picture on the board. And he should accept taking small local losses (or just less wins) for playing "big moves" elsewhere on the board.

But then, I guess the last point can be said of almost everyone that has not yet reached a really low single-digit kyu (explicitly including myself, here).

Feel free to mail me in case of further questions.];B[qd]C[Alch1m1s7 [11k\]: great game]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[qo];B[op]LB[ql:D][dp:A][np:B][mq:C]C[H: This move (and the joseki that follows) gave me a hard time. Firstly, I admit that I had to look up the joseki which looks fine in itself (and goes until move 9). However, taking white A into account I don't like the the black position being open at the end (cf. variation).

And  there is another reason: as white decided not to take the upper left, but to attack instead. black should aim at getting sente in the following struggle. Then he can go for the upper left himself.

The joseki leads to the opposite result. Black will have to respond to whites attack from the left and stays in gote.

Alternatives are e.g. B and C. C would end the "fight" almost instantly as both players can settle themselves (assuming white D). Plus - black has sente,  now.]
(;W[ql];B[qp];W[po];B[mp]C[H: As mentioned before: I did not know this joseki, so I like to stress that (disregarding the outcome) black played it just right.]
;W[kq];B[mr]LB[mq:B][mr:A]C[H: Black A makes sense. However, in my opinion, the connection at B would have had the same result (securing the black corner), but would make blacks group more solid.]
;W[lq];B[cn]LB[dc:D][cd:C][dd:B][lq:A]C[H: As black decides to ignore A (which is sensible), he should go for the upper left corner (B/C/D) instead of engaging in another attack. 
Recall from your first games: "corners first, then the sides, then the rest/center".]
;W[fq];B[bp]LB[cn:A][bp:B]C[H: As black started with A instead of taking the corner, B is the move he already aimed at so that is perfectly fine. The following joseki is played correctly again.]
;W[cl];B[cq]LB[dn:D][en:B][hp:C][cq:A]C[H: Instead of heading for the corner at A, going for the center at B would be possible, too.

(Note that if white at move 20 did not choose to connect his groups at C, but played D, black would have been cut off from the center. Playing B right here would prevent that.)]
;W[co];B[bo];W[hp];B[dn]LB[cl:A]C[H: Good move. Now white can't seal black in, and white A looks pretty lonely.]
;W[ci]
(;B[dd]LB[cd:D][dd:B][cf:C][dp:A]C[H: Finally :-)

However, compared to playing this move more early (where white A was the only stone on the left), black B is not as flexible as the hoshi normally is. As white can attack from a very convenient position (two space jump at C), black should consider choosing a more corner oriented position like D (cf. variations).]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[jc]LB[cc:A][jc:B][oc:C][ef:D]
C[H: Black played the sequence until A just fine. Now he has several options: either to extend the left group (as he did at B), or settling the upper right corner (at C), or do something completely different like trying to reduce white's influence into the center by playing D.

Judging from urgency, C is the one to play first. Additionally, it makes the most immediate territory and is the only one that settles black's position stable, i.e. without fearing immediate attack.]
;W[hd]LB[qd:A]C[H: White should attack A right away instead.]
;B[hc]LB[hd:A]C[H: Bad outcome for white. But that reaction was to be expected. Now black has something to chase (A). If possible while building territory at the same time.]
;W[oc]
(;B[pc]LB[lc:C][mc:D][oc:A][pc:B][qg:E]C[H: Black plays safe here, and I hesitate to criticize. 

But on the other hand, compared to the "perfect" follow up at A, B seems rather slow, and the territory made is rather small. Additionally, it allows white to get  a nice (although not as secure as if B was not there) two space jump to C.

Black's other options (cf. variations) are: 
1) Extend at E which is the smooth "no fight" variant (if white does not force it.
2) Attack at D leaving white struggle for a stable base];W[lc]
;B[qj]LB[qj:A]C[H: In my view that's overplay. The white group below is not really weak so A might get (and in fact got) into trouble right away. However, putting the white group under some pressure might fit players with a preference for fights.]
;W[qh];B[oj]C[H: Good.];W[qf];B[qb]LB[qb:C][pe:B][qf:A]C[H: Instead of going for immediate life, black could have put the white group at A under pressure, first. Even if he is not able to really do harm to the white group by playing B and following, C is still open to him.]
;W[pe];B[om]LB[om:A]C[H: Good. The outcome of this move is pretty good for black. But even if white played differently, A still reduces white's options to enlarge his group.]
;W[pk];B[pj];W[rj];B[qk];W[rk];B[pl];W[qm];B[pm]LB[oo:A]C[H: Well done by black in this sequence. The connection of the white group could not be avoided, but now white is cut off from the center (in case black gets to play around A).]
;W[qi];B[oo];W[nl];B[ok];W[mm];B[id]LB[hd:A][id:B][me:C][ef:D]
[jf:E][oj:G][dk:F]C[H: Using pressure on A, black has numerous options here. 
- B has the double threat of capturing A and of reducing white's not-yet-territory around C
- D has the double effect of attacking A and of stopping white's left group from expanding
- E is similar to B but on a larger scale or "looser frame"
- F can be used to stop white's extension head-on

As black can invade the space around C with his G stones anyway (so the double effect of B is reduced to attacking A), I would not have chosen B, here, but D.]
;W[fe];B[re]LB[gd:B][id:A][md:H][od:G][ke:C][re:E][if:D][dk:F]
C[H: However, now that black has chosen A before, he should definitely follow up on it like with B,C,D. Ignoring a move that is a response to an attack makes black look like he did not to intend at all in the first place.

E is not necessary to secure the corner group so there are a moves that are a lot more relevant (reduce at F, attack at G or H, ...)]
;W[pd];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb];W[qe];B[rc];W[fl]LB[ei:B][fl:A]C[H: The moves on the upper right made black loose sente. So white A allows white to claim a big territory extension around B.]
;B[ep]C[H: Even if black would not loose the following sequence (by not detecting a ladder?), this capture is very small compared to what white builds up in the center.]
;W[eq];B[do];W[eo];B[fp]C[H: Mistake. Black underestimates/ignore the ladder. Unfortunately, if you engage in a ladder for several moves and loose it, the benefit for your opponent is exceptionally high.]
;W[fo];B[gp];W[go];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[iq];B[dq];W[hr]C[H: Devastating for black (compare to situation before blacks "attack" at move #65). White is rock-solid and has enormous influence into the center.]
;B[cp];W[lo]LB[gd:B][ge:C][jj:A]C[H: Now white tries to seal black of the center completely. 

Black must try to stop white or he will loose by far.

Possible black moves:
- Playing at A is not too dangerous as black may "run for help to the right and to the top black groups.
- Atari at B, then run into white's moyo at C];B[mo];W[mn];B[he]
;W[gd];B[ge]LB[gc:G][fd:F][ge:B][he:A][hg:D][hh:C][ii:E]C[H: The attach at A should not lead to black B but to a follow up into whites moyo at C or D or E.

With B, then white F and black G, black looses sente (again) and white can strengthen his loose, but big framework.]
;W[fd];B[gc];W[fg];B[jg]LB[hh:B][ii:A]C[H: Good. May even be further down at A or B.]
;W[if];B[je]LB[ie:A][je:C][jg:B]C[H: Connecting solidly at A would have been better. I guess black fears B to be too alone. But then there is the right black group where B can still "flee" to, if needed. 
Playing C allows white to stop the black "invasion" in this area]
;W[ie];B[jf];W[hg];B[em];W[en]LB[el:A]C[H: White mistake. Blocking at A would have left white's moyo intact.]
;B[dl]C[H: Good move to punish white's mistake. (As is the following sequence.]
;W[el];B[dk];W[ck];B[ej];W[cm];B[dm];W[dj];B[ek];W[ei];B[fj]
;W[hj];B[lj]C[H: Good move again, as is #112, later.];W[kk]
;B[lk];W[ll];B[gk];W[fk];B[gj];W[fm];B[hl];W[hm];B[il];W[cb]
;B[db];W[cd];B[dc];W[kd];B[jd];W[mk];B[mj];W[kj];B[al]LB[nf:A]
[jm:B]C[H: The monkey jump is estimated to take 4-5 points from the opponent (and tends to end in gote, if I am not mistaken).

So attacking/reducing around A would be another option. As is going deeper into white's territory at B.]
;W[bk];B[ij]LB[nf:A][jm:B]C[H: Black won't make much difference in score by this. A and B are still open - and are of more importance.]
;W[hi];B[ii]C[H: Here and in the followin, black continues with "irrelevant" small "attacks" that don't lead to him winning anything. So he looses several moves.]
;W[ih];B[jk];W[ki];B[mb];W[hk];B[gl];W[ik];B[jl];W[jj];B[jn]
;W[im];B[jm];W[li];B[mi];W[lg];B[og];W[oh];B[nh];W[ph];B[mg]

;W[kn];B[de];W[df];B[ee];W[ef];B[gi];W[hh];B[ak];W[ai];B[nn]
;W[kl];B[dr];W[ls];B[nr]LB[nr:B][ns:A]C[H: "Standard" answer is A instead of B.

There won't be any more comments on the end game. The only thing worth noting is that following cgoban's "Score estimation", black turns a 25.5 points lead of white to an only 1.5 points lead from here until the end.
Even if I would not "believe" in what the software estimates, it shows that black did well in winning those often highly relevant points in the end game.

My summary is given at the beginning of the game.

Thanks for letting me review, and I wish you good games to come!
