C[Hello!

Thanks for reviewing this game!

 I hope you can give me some general advices about the direction of play and some tactical & strategical improvements.


 Greetings, Nikolai

C[this looks like a nice move to me - extentions from the wall + reducing

Personally I think you can build bottom moyo instead, it certainly looks bigger]
;W[ie];B[ld]C[how about that? wanted to threaten a cut-off
