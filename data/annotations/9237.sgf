C[I played white this game.  I happened to win, but this is a game
I basically lost.

I would appreciate tips on how to more effectively deal with
black's moyo.

move, is D10 better for countering his influence on the right?

;W[cm];B[dk];W[dl];B[el];W[cl];B[ek]C[Now, I felt that it was difficult to decide where to play.  I
considered a few moves: L3, K4, K5 (see variations).

Rev: All of them don't feel good; they are too close to Black's
thickness.]
(;W[jo]C[Because of the aforementioned reasons, I selected K5.

Rev: Still off the mark.]
(;B[eo]C[Seemed soft.  I thought black might K7.

Rev: Nice one by Black.];W[kl]C[I also considered K8.

Rev: Either way is OK.]
(;B[jm]C[I want to play L7, but it seems too soon, because of the variation.

Rev: Black let you off the hook.]
(;W[jq]C[Because of the variation shown, I wanted to try to force on the
bottom.  I imagined the shown variation.

Rev: Interesting but risky.]

way, N1 is sente. Connecting makes T5 sente, but that is another
story.];B[mn];W[kr];B[in];W[ir];B[hr];W[kp];B[me]C[Black's moyo is now becoming something serious.  Still, I answered
him.

is good here.];W[ld];B[kf];W[if]C[Seemed to be at the head of two spheres of influence.

I needed to do something fast.

around here, because I think he could have killed me.

for connecting with O2 and jumping at L5.  However, it looks

endgame play here is N2. It is bad, but not for your reasons.
