C[Hi!
I'm k43r and i'll try to show how to improve your go.
My comments will be be written with prefix "kr:"

You've chosen right corner with right direction ^^ 1st move wchich is made on 3-4 point should be made on r16.

I've placed some links to articles on senseis.xmp.net. Try to read them and apply them in your gameplay, ou'll surely gain 3 stones of strenght in no-time!]

I've marked surely bad exchanges of stones. Try not to play them any more!
From this game i cannot tell your style, whole this game was dominated by white player, and since move 22, you were playing *his* game. 

Your main mistakes were:
Not playing g17 - kind of loosing move
Pushing from behind white group at k15
Creating two groups inside white moyo, and trying to live with them both
keeping d15 junk stone

What's more, don't play games when you can't concentrate, and also don't send them to gtl - you certainly see your mistakes if you look at your game.]
