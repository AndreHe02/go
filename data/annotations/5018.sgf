C[I played white in this game. Thanks for your comments in advance, your time is greatly appreciated.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[co];W[cm]C[this opening went very badly for me]
;B[ep]C[i was not sure how to respond to this

Things to look up in the books:

1)  White would love to push at D4 and then cut at E5.  Depending on where white's C7 stone is, this push and cut is good, and black's E4 is too agressive.  But in other situations, white's push and cut is unreasonable.  Please look it up (as I don't know whether this particular white C7 is in the place for black or white's advantage in the cut).

2)  When the E4 press by black is reasonable, often it's better for white to expand at E3 to make more territory.  Note how when black plays E3, black's wall works well with Q3 to give black advantage on lower side, and white's corner becomes smaller.]

(;W[cp]C[as mentioned above, E3 or D4 better depending on C7 placement.  look at variations.  i've played out some of the possibilities]
;B[eq]C[white should push with empty triangle]
(;W[do];B[dp];W[bo];B[cq]C[black got more than he deserved]
;W[bp];B[bq];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[np];W[qj];B[iq]
;W[mr]C[i wanted to try out this low invasion to see how it would work out. Black should have attacked this stone much more strongly and i got out too easily in my opinion.]
;B[nr]C[
As black, I would have tried to crush the stone with M3 .  The invasion looks too deep.

I think instead of invadin at all, white at P17 or P18 (Come to Guo Juan's memorial weekend workshop to learn which is better !) is bigger than an invasion at bottom.]
;W[lp];B[cf];W[ch];B[ef];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[di];W[dh]C[
Usually, white plays C11 before D12, because sometimes black can answer D12 at C11 himself.  Whether he can in this situation I'm not sure.]
;B[eh];W[ci];B[ei]C[this was a bit strange by black, D10 was big i think

As black, I would play D10 instead of E11 I think.];W[dj];B[ej]
;W[dk]C[
white got more than he deserved here];B[nn];W[ip];B[hp]C[black maybe should have played more attacking?]
;W[jp]C[
black is getting too much here and the w stones on the bottom are becomin heavy (cause they don't have eyes, while black has life to their left and right)

When playinjg a move like J4, be prepared to answer H4 at either crosscut at H3 or hane at K3, depending on the situation.

An exellent situation showing this sort of thing (but advanced!!!) is in "100 Challenging Go Problems for 100 Days of Study" problem number 23.]
;B[jq]C[I would consider black H5 instead of K3.   With black K3, it looks like white's own H5 press or/and cut at H3 helps white get settled.]
;W[kq];B[ol];W[pl];B[qh];W[om];B[nm]C[the white p7 black o7 combination hurts white's lower stones.  As white, instead of p7, I'd consider h5 which threatens h3 cut, thus helping white's lower shape.  actually, white can consider cutting at h3 right away instead of h5.  might give more forcing plays to help the white stones.

w n3 also looks possible, since it threatens o3 which threaten either to capture o2 or life, or to cut of the o4 stones.]
;W[ok];B[kc]C[

black should answer at o8 to help attack white]
(;W[od]C[i really wanted to take the ponnuki, but blacks next move would have been just too big i think.]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[pf];W[ic]C[not sure what white should do, possibly press with P14 which seems to threaten R15 and Q13....]
;B[ke]C[J17 was bad for white i think. I did not consider the fact that black would jump and put a lot of pressure on an already very weak group at O16. I think it was a bad mistake to leave this group without playing an extra move to help settle them.]

(;W[nf];B[nh];W[lc]C[
black is starting to make big center, which he could fortify with M13 which attacks both white's top stones and white's bottom stones.  So instead of white M17 I would consider coming out at N13, looking for opportunity to break up black's center and maybe attack black's L15 stones.]
;B[lb];W[ld];B[kd];W[mb];B[hc]C[this is clever by black, and i did'nt know how to respond


As black, I would rather answer at L18 to keep the white group unsettled, after which black still has H17 plus all the attacks against white's top group.]

(;W[gc];B[hb];W[hd];B[ib];W[id];B[ge];W[gd];B[ea]C[
black is playin an endgame move before the groups have eyes.  As white I would answer this at J14, since white needs life, and black also isn't alive at top.]
;W[gb];B[bb];W[bc];B[ac];W[be];B[ce];W[cd];B[ae]C[should white take ko now or play B14 ?]
;W[ad];B[kb]C[Here i was choosing between settling the O16 group once and for all, or maintaining some attack on black by preventing the connection underneath and taking C14's base away.]
;W[bf];B[me];W[le]C[
looks like if black comes out at N14, white may be in trouble here, but not sure since the black stones at L15 don't have shape either.
