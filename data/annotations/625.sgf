;B[dd];W[pq];B[qc];W[dp];B[fq];W[eq];B[fo];W[qo]C[leaves your corner a1 alone, c4 would be better]
;B[cq];W[cp]C[before!];B[dq]
(;W[ep];B[er];W[dr]C[you should drop the corner and play c8 maybe to make a base for your
group on the side];B[cr];W[fr];B[es];W[ck]C[a bit too far away]
;B[gq];W[kq];B[cn];W[dn];B[do];W[co];B[eo];W[cm];B[bn];W[bo]
;B[dm];W[en]C[you should play the atari at b7 and if black takes at e6 you could
connect underneath at a6. if black defends at a6 himself you can still make a
base for your group on the left side with the knights attack at c14 and then
c12. The group is big and alive!];B[em];W[fn];B[gn];W[qj];B[fp]
;W[cg]C[too far away again. if one stone jump two only to c12, or attack at
c14, black has to react];B[ci];W[cj];B[ei];W[di];B[dh];W[ch]
;B[dj];W[bi];B[fm];W[ce]C[good play. your group should live.]
;B[cd];W[be];B[cl];W[bl];B[bm];W[al];B[bd];W[dg]C[a move on a side star, let´s say at k16 would be better at this
moment, your group is already alive];B[dk];W[fg]C[again, you should take k16 or k10, or maybe attack r17 with r15 or
s15];B[gd];W[jj]C[good move i think];B[ql];W[pl]C[too close, you should play the knights move at p9 or the one point
approach at p 8. See, when you play against a stronger player, you should
avoid contact fighting whereever you can. A good player can play the contact
move at q8 (but he wouldn´t, i think). in contact fighting things get messy
fast, and you have to have a lot of knowledge of how things will go. The black
stone on r8 is very weak, has no helping stones, so you needn´t attack him so
aggessively.];B[pm];W[ol]C[maybe you should hane at p7 too, you have supporting stones round you
and black has no connection to elseone];B[qk];W[pj];B[om];W[mm]
C[maybe here you should "hit the head of two stones" at o7 (now you are
already in contact fighting, so don´t be afraid). Very painful for black]

(;W[qq];B[rp];W[ro];B[qn];W[rq];B[rn];W[sp]C[blacks group is nearly alive as a result of this battle]

atari, there has to be a purpose];B[jn];W[kn];B[in];W[hp];B[hq]
;W[lq];B[nr];W[nm]C[you should try to do something for your group m3, it is not dead yet]
;B[nn];W[km]C[unecessary, the group is connected yet. n16 or r13 would be good]
;B[qg]C[now your side group gets under attack also];W[mp]C[what do you intend with this move? you should care about the moves of
black. try to be in harmony with the movements of your opponent. it´s a play
of two players and they create a movement together. so what is the intention
of your opponent? you should react to the moves of your opponent. otherwise
you disturb the harmony of the big movement. or your nonreaction has a good
reason!];B[mo];W[lo];B[mp];W[ns]C[too far out];B[ms];W[pr];B[lr]

;B[rj];W[ri];B[sj];W[qi];B[og];W[kr]C[you should attack the upper right corner with n17 or so, last chance
to make territory. the lower middle is finished, nothing to do for you
anymore];B[nc]C[now black is completely safe];W[ks]C[what is your intention?]
;B[ir];W[ls];B[mr])
(;W[ro]C[this moves saves your corner group and attacks the base of the black
group. and now the cut at r7 is a threat.  it is a move that "has two
meanings" try to look for such moves]))
(;W[er];B[dr];W[bq]C[and the black stones are in big trouble!
Remember that in the beginning there's no ko threat big enough.
If black plays somewhere else you win the ko!];B[br];W[ds];B[cr]
