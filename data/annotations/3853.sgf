White playing 'D' comes from the wrong direction.  Whites biggest framework is on the left, so A is better.  If B tries to not be sealed in, W will naturally acquire thickness at the top to support his weakness.  (see variation)]

Well, B has limited his development on the right side by playing R14.  Wouldn't it be nice if this stone were at 'A' now? (or previous to O16, at 'D')

At this point in the game, there is a big point left (B), but if you look closely, it would be disasterous for W to play C.  Black calmly playing C is a great move.]
;B[ke]C[This just gives W a target.];W[jd]LB[fg:A]C[The marked stone is bad.  It should be played at 'A'.]
;B[kg]LB[nf:A]TR[ke]C[>This move had H16 in mind. Probably overplay, however not unreasonable >because black asks, not only for the cut, but also for feedback from a stronger >player in the GTL, which is very reasonable indeed. =)

H16 is too agressive again.  B needs to not hurt his nice right side framework, especially after W was so nice to play K16.  A move like 'A' is wonderful, working excellently with the marked stone, and if W captures the marked stone later, B will get a nice wall that suddenly gives him a moyo.]
;W[ng]C[W takes the key point];B[hd]LB[gg:A]C[Bad move.  Don't give yourself another weak group when you already have one.  If you are trying to help it, play at G13 or something that is useful by itself]

Black stones ARE at a definite disadvantage.  See the variation for another way to play.]

Generally bad without other moves around. White has all these forcing moves at 'A', 'B', and 'C'.  You have nowhere to run really.

The push through at 'D' and cut at 'E' *is* a good thing to keep in mind though.]
