;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[df];B[jd];W[qo]C[ reid:  Looking at this position, it seems pretty certain
that black is going to respond to r5 with a pincer.  It
might be more interesting (and easier for white to
continue) if white makes blacks next move a bit harder to
decide on:  try white r6 instead of r5.

If black still responds with a pincer, white can settle this
area with a contact play at r3.  If black plays r4 to take
the corner,  white simply extends up the side to r9,
breaking up the black moyo on the upper side before it has a
chance to get started.

Nevertheless, r5 is certainly playable.];B[pl];W[no];B[mq];W[lo]
C[I don't know much about O5 common  follow up.
I didn't want to induce a black answer on the lower side, as it may hurt my D4 stone.
That's why i didn't play M4 but M5.
What are white possibilities to reinforce its group ?

reid: When thinking about m4, the question is how white
feels about black pushing at n4, white m5, black cutting at
m5.  In this game, the black cutting stone seems to be
inside whites area of influence (because of the stones at
d4 and d14) so it's probably playable.  But there is no
doubt that it could lead to a fight and m5 is safer.];B[kp]
C[I didn't want to push my opponent on the 4th line, but a black move at L5 seems very
severe.
N8 surely reinforces my group, but black would be happy to answer at Q11, no ?
What should i do in this situation ?

reid:  This is a good analysis.

The natural consequence of playing safe with m5 instead of challenging
with m4 is that black gets the nice move at l4.  But this means that
black hasn't defended his original pincer, so...];W[pj]C[ reid:  this attacking move (or possibly r10 or q11, too)
is a good continuation for white.];B[nl];W[ll]C[ reid:  this is good, and m7 is also playable.]
;B[oj]C[ reid:  This is probably a situation where black doesn't want
to contact white.  Think: "you touch me, you help me".  Not
a go proverb, but it probably should be :-)

Black doesn't want to do anything to help white settle this one
stone.  I think o10 would be a bit better for black.];W[pi]
C[Was P11 better for white ?
What is the difference between these two moves (Q11 and P11) ?

reid:  Good questions!  And the answer (as in everything else on
the go board) depends on the situation.   
Here we have a single white stone inside blacks sphere of influence.
White would like to settle this stone as fast as possible.  In this
kind of situation, white should be thinking light and fast, and he
should avoid anything that has the potential to become heavy.  I think
the hane at p11 is a bit better.  However, blacks play makes the point
kind of moot.];B[pk]C[ reid:  I think black missed an opportunity here.

An ideal strategic position in go is to have a single group attacking
two enemy groups simultaneously (splitting attack).  If black takes
whites base with a move like r14 instead of q9, white will be forced to
run away.  As white runs, blacks p10 group also runs forming a nice
splitting attack.

This is why I think white P11 is a bit better than Q11.  But black
q9 is a bit heavy too, so now Q11 is OK.];W[oi]C[ reid:  Given the previous discussion, we can see that white
r14 would be a nice move here.  If white can settle his q11
group, he can chase the black q10 group with moves like m10
or m11.  This direction would help to re-enforce his m5
group and would also work nicely with the d14 and d4 stones.

Trying to make *all* your stones work well together is the
key to go.];B[nj]C[ reid: This is heavy.  n10 is faster.  Blacks goal here is
not to make eyes, it's to run out and connect.];W[ni];B[mj]
;W[nd]C[ reid:  This is ambitious :-)

White already has two weak groups on the board, and now he
is potentially launching a third.];B[pf]C[ reid:  I don't like this move for black.  I think it goes
against the "play away from strength" principle.

If it were me, I would either play patiently with r14
(settle the corner in sente, then turn at n11 followed by
pushing up at l5) or I would start an attack right away
with o15 (try to keep white split into so many groups that
he doesn't have time to get enough territory to win).

Q14 seems to be half-way between these two strategies, and
so it doesn't do either one very well.];W[nf];B[nc]C[ reid:  This induces white to hane at n17, hurting the black
stones at k16 and f17.];W[mc];B[oc];W[md];B[mi]C[I didn't want to connect the 2 white groups with a move around O13 , it looks too
submissive .
Right or wrong ?

reid:  Well, I agree that o13 is too submissive, but I still
think connecting the two white groups is a good idea.  So
the question is: is there a good (non-submissive) way to
connect?  Before looking at the variation, see if you can
find the move I'm thinking of.]
(;W[qe]C[ reid: this is an interesting, though potentially dangerous,
alternative.];B[pe];W[qf];B[qg];W[rg];B[rh];W[qh];B[pg];W[ri]

necessary, either.];B[ql]C[ reid: but black answers...];W[pp]
C[ reid: I think p4 would be a bit better for white here.  Then
after black answers at p3, white still has the slide at s3.]

C[ reid:  It is difficult to build a moyo if you have a weak
group on the board.  Perhaps j6 would be better than d9?];B[jo]
;W[jl]C[ reid: I think I prefer the hane at k6 to this loose jump.]

;B[hp];W[fn];B[er];W[dr];B[cr];W[es]C[I guess it would have been wiser to answer at c3 and then to play around L11 ?

reid: The "cool" way to do it is to play c3 instead of d2
:-)  But yes, c3 now might be a bit better.  Of course,
there's no guarantee black would respond at d1 right away.]

;B[kk];W[ij];B[lj];W[ii]C[ reid:  This move seems to save the wrong stones:  since the
m5 group is more important than k11 (or l13), I think j9
is more important than j11 .];B[hm];W[gl]C[G8 is really a big mistake. I guess i should answer simply at J9.

reid: Yes.  White is in trouble here because he really needs
to hold onto most of the left-side moyo, but he's got the
weak group to deal with.  J9 might leave him with too little
territory.  So maybe g8 is a good gamble.];B[gm];W[fm]C[ reid: Yikes! Now the cut is going to be easy for black!  How
about if white plays at h8 instead?  Black pushes in a
little bit, but the wall at c7 should hold.  So maybe black
should have played at h8 directly instead of g7?];B[hl];W[hk]
;B[gk];W[fl];B[ik];W[hj];B[jk]C[The game is over .No need to comment the hopeless end :-)

reid:  Yah, pretty hard after this.  I don't think black and
white are that terribly miss-matched in this game.  It seems
that whites opening is actually a bit better than blacks,
but in this game, white was unable to turn an early
advantage into a winning position.  This may be due to
whites somewhat overly-ambitious maneuvering inside blacks
sphere of influence, resulting it too many weak white
groups.

It's always difficult as white, since you're "coming from
behind", but if you can settle your groups early, you'll
find your games easier.  Remember that each group needs two
eyes by the end of the game, and that making eyes is
expensive (it takes lots of moves).  This is why
connecting groups is nearly always a good idea: reduce the
number of eyes you need to make.

I always feel that if my opponent has two weak groups on the
board, I should be able to work out some way to win.  So my
recommendation is: don't be the one with weak groups :-)];W[oq]
