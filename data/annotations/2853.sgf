C[This is a close game.  I'm playing black, and won by 2.5 
points, but only because white made multiple failed invasions.   I'd like to 
know whether white's invasion attempts are really dangerous or overplays.

Other than that, I'm just looking for general advice.   I think this is a 
good game to get reviewed because upon my review I only found a couple of 
things that are fundamentally dumb.  I've pointed those things out.  So 
anything else is just stuff I don't know yet or don't play optimally.

I don't play many severe or risky moves in here, and  I made no attempts at 
tesujis of any kind.  I think I may have remained too concentrated and wider 
extensions and larger jumps in the middle game may have been possible.

I use an SGF viewer that allows me to navigate many variations easily, so 
don't be afraid to include interesting sequences.  I typically learn a lot 
from those.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp]C[I use this fuseki a lot, and sometimes the Chinese opening.   (3 at 
Q3 and 5 at R9 if my opponent doesn't approach 3).  But I don't have much 
skill in using influence, so I'd like comments on proper follow-up.

I think white plays for territory earlier in the game that I do.]
;W[dp];B[fc]LB[pj:a]C[I prefer this to making on sanrensei at 'a' immediately.  
(In this game, I actually do it later.)];W[cf];B[ic];W[ec];B[fd]
;W[fq];B[pj]LB[cm:a]C[Nothing seemed urgent, so I did this.  I didn't think much 
about invading the left side at this time.  I suppose 'a' is possible if I'd 
wanted to do that.

So far, white is playing relatively territorially.  Should I adapt my 
strategy accordingly?

This is a reasonable move.  Right now, you're winning the game.  White's 
moves have been too small compared to the influence he has given you.]
;W[cn]LB[cj:A][jq:B]C[This move is WAY too small.  There is no reason for 
White not to make a bigger move.  A or B we be a lot better.]

(;B[dj]LB[jp:A]C[With less space between white's stones on the side, I 
thought a deep invasion would be unwise.  I played on the fourth line to 
increase chances of being able to escape to the center if necessary.  I 
don't know about this move, though.  It may be too timid.

In this game, I probably got a better result from it than I deserved.

You're right about a deep invasion - that would be a bad idea.  You would 
not be able to make a base on the side, and White would get to make some 
profit while you were running away.  See variation.

Another thing that might be good to try here is a move like A.  This would 
create a truly enormous framework in the center.  I think White would have 
trouble reducing it enough.

I don't like this move very much because it is inconsistent with your 
strategy so far.  Now you're basically giving White a weak group to chase 
into the center, which will ruin the influence you have developed so far.]
;W[ci];B[cj]LB[dm:A]C[I don't like this move at this point in the game.  Something 
like A would probably be better.];W[dh];B[dm]LB[fi:c][dl:a]
[em:b]C[I think I read recently that an angle play like 
this as part of an extension is bad, because it strengthens white more that 
black.  Of course, white's group is already strong down there.

It now looks like B13 should have been played somewhere else.

Given the situation, where's a better place for B17?   My first thoughts are 
'a' and 'b.'   White looks a little too strong in the upper right for me to 
get away with 'c'.

I think this move is fine.  You don't need to worry about strengthening 
White in the lower left - that's already solid territory for him.  You're 
also making a wall facing your influence on the other side of the board, 
which is a good thing.

I think if there was a bad move in this sequence, it was B15.  It doesn't 
serve much purpose right now.];W[cq]C[This is a mistake for White.  You don't want to jump into the 
corner, so this is basically a wasted move at this point.];B[fg]
LB[ei:D][fi:A][fl:C][cm:a][eo:B]C[Probably a mistake.  I can't connect 
the upper black group to the side one in one move, and this is too far away 
from the group.   White's group in the upper left is not going to be 
intimidated by this, either.

Since white did not respond locally to B17, perhaps 'a' is possible here?

This is a mistake.  It is okay in terms of the framework at the top, but the 
problem is, if White pushes through around A, you're going to have to either 
let him into your framework, or get your group on the left into trouble.

I would not recommend 'a'.  It's way too slow.  If you want to play another 
move on the left, I like B, C, or D better.];W[ei];B[ej];W[fi]
;B[gk]C[I now feel settled here.  That may be overconfident.

You're not settled, but you're not in immediate danger, either.]
;W[ip]C[White's move is too slow.]
(;B[mc]LB[pc:B][gh:A][lp:C]C[So is yours :)

Think bigger - something like A would be a lot better.  That would stake out 
a large framework at the top.  B would be better, too, because it protects 
the corner, and threatens to turn your framework into territory.  This move 
accomplishes neither goal.  I still like something around C, too.]
;W[qf]C[This is exactly why it would have been good to protect the corner on 
the last move.  Now White is threatening to live on the side, or jump into 
the corner.  If the corner was safe, you could chase his group around now.  
See variation.];B[pf]LB[qe:a][of:A]C['a' is also an option here, especially with the black 
stone at Q10, but the usual follow-up from white would prompt white to run 
into my moyo.

Right.  You probably don't want to play at a.  Even this move is too close 
to the white stone.  There is a go proverb that says 'Attack with the 
knight's move'.  I would prefer A here.  It turns most of the moyo into 
territory.];W[rd]C[This is not a very good move for White.]
;B[qe]C[And this is why.];W[re];B[qg];W[qd];B[rf]C[Now White is in big trouble.  Even if he manages to live in the 
corner, he has helped you strengthen your framework.];W[pc]
;B[od];W[oc];B[nc];W[qb]LB[nd:a]C[I am sort of happy with this result.  Please let me know if 
that assessment is wrong.

Q10 now looks too close, and the whole thickness on the outside seems a bit 
overconcentrated.

There's a cutting point at 'a' which I don't fix up.  When I does cut here 
there's a ladder breaker, but I didn't notice that at this time.]
;B[hi]LB[gh:a]C[Surrounding white's group here apparantly isn't sente.  
White will tenuki.   But at least it keeps me slightly better connected, but 
only slightly because of the weakness at 'a.'

This move is a mistake.  It really doesn't do much to connect your groups 
because of the move at a.  Again, by jumping in on the left, you've created 
a problem for yourself.  It is going to be very hard to protect the 
framework and the group on the left at the same time.];W[nq]
;B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[lp]LB[no:A]C[I like white's extension here---it's viable because of the 
stone at J4.   White does well for himself on the lower side in this game.

I don't like this extension much :)  It's too cautious, and White's stones 
are too close together.  He should play around A if he wants to expand the 
bottom territory.];B[mn]C[This is just what I thought might be a light reducing/containment 
move.

This is a really good move.];W[cm]C[This is another mistake for White.  This gains about 2 points -- 
much too small for this stage of the game.];B[cl];W[nd]C[I think this is a mistake.  The ladder doesn't work for white.]

;B[om];W[nn];B[lk];W[ll];B[mk];W[qh]LB[ff:b][gh:a][qj:A]C[What's black's best response to this?  White 
fails in the next few moves, but against a stronger white I'm not sure I 
could get a good result.

Or is this just a gross overplay by white?

Or, pose it this way:

White to play and invade black's moyo.   If I were white, I would have 
started at 'a' or 'b'.  They're safer, but I don't know if there are better.

a is a MUCH better move for White.  This invasion is unreasonable.  Your 
best move is probably A, preventing White from making any eyes on the side.]
;B[qi];W[rh];B[ri];W[rg];B[ph]LB[sf:A]C[Here you should play at A, preventing White from linking up 
his stones.  It doesn't matter if he can run out into your moyo, as long as 
he can't live in there.];W[sf];B[qf];W[jc]C[White should play at A, to consolidate his gains.  See variation.]

;W[lc]C[This is another unreasonable invasion for White.  He has no room to 
make eyes, and the black stones in the area are very strong.  You need to 
make sure he can't connect to the group in the corner, and keep him from 
making eyes.];B[lb]C[This accomplishes both goals nicely.];W[le]

destroy White's position.  See variation.];W[id];B[jd];W[ke]

White may be helping me out a bit, of course. :-)

C[Mainly, I'm just looking for sente moves here.  My 
endgame isn't very sophisticated.   'a' looks good too.  'b' looks like a 
tesuji I don't know, so I wouldn't play it but maybe there's something good 
here.

In the endgame, you want to play the biggest moves first, and, in general, 
sente moves before gote moves.  It looks like you're on the right track.]

were bigger moves.   Bad habit.  Even if that's true, it's hard to keep

In this case, you made the right move.  If White jumps into the corner, it's 
bigger than if he captures those two stones.];W[mm]C[It would have been interesting for you to play here first.  See

not too bad for me.   1 group to 3.

My 4th-line "reduction" on the left side worked better that I thought.

White had a few failed incursions and invasions.  If they'd worked, I'd have 
lost big time

The 4th line reduction was actually a big mistake.  If you hadn't done that, 
you might have won by 30 or more points.  Look at how many stones you played 
in that area, compared to how many points you got out of it.  You played 27 
stones for 8 points.  That's not very efficient.  Granted, you took away 
about 20 points of white territory, too.  Even taking that into account, 
you're only getting 1 point per stone.  Also, if White would have played the 
cut correctly, you would have wound up with a lot less.

White's invasions were unreasonable.  You need to be able to stop such 
invasions.  You did alright on the right side, but the white stones at the 
top center should never have escaped.  That made a difference of about 25 
points.  One thing too keep in mind is not to play too close to stones that 
you are attacking.  When you are attacking invading stones, it is tempting 
to play any atari that you see, but that is not the best way to kill.  It is 
better to make strong walls a few spaces away while also taking the key 
points for making eyes.  This is something that comes with a lot of 
practice.

Your game looked pretty decent to me.  I doubt you'll be 26k for long.]
