;B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[qf];B[qh]C[Up to Black 9, both players are making first-class moves. If someone told me that these were two insei playing, I might believe it.]

(;W[nd]C[White 10 however, gives the secret away. While not bad, it's not a move I would expect a pro to play (although I would likely play it myself.) This is due to a difference in how amateurs and pros view this position.

(See diagram - "Transferring to the 3-3 Point")];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[qg];W[pc];B[qe];W[qc]C[The sequence up to 16 is joseki. White has avoided getting locked in the corner. But what has it cost him?

A pro looks at the mangled white stones at 8 and 12 with horror. I once had the honor of playing an even game with Kamimura 9-dan, and after I had sacrificed two stones in a similar way he cried, "Why did you play there, just to die!?" (After that, he made me play with three stones.)

A White invasion on the right side is now going to be ineffective, because Black doesn't need to worry about making eyes for his group, a huge difference.

So while I admit that White 10 is the easy way to play, if you want to get stronger, I believe that it's better to kick the habit of using sacrifice stones and sente moves to try to get "something for nothing". Take it slow, play the honest gote move, and win by outhinking your opponent.]

(;B[do]C[Now after White 16, Black needs to think very carefully about his next move. Many people would play Black 17 without hesitation. "I've got to block his shimari, or the left side could get big."

Remember that Black gets the first move, and if both sides play well, you can't really expect a few points of komi to make up for that advantage. White is forced to try to catch up. Black on the other hand, merely needs to maintain his advantage. He doesn't need to start trouble.

So in this game, the first thing is for Black to realize that he is still in the lead, especially because of his strong position on the right. So he should just surround territory, and keep surrounding it faster than White can. He should not waste any time trying to interfere with White's territorial expansion.

In Japanese, this is the "kakoiai", or race to surround.];W[co]

(;B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fq];B[cj]LB[oq:A]C[With the joseki Black chose, he has reduced White territory. Black pats himself on the shoulder: a big success!

But at what cost? First, Black has given up the opportunity to surround with a move such as A. Even worse, White 22 is a spearpoint aiming to the right, reducing the Black territorial framework..

After White attached at 18, Black still could have made a better choice by choosing the Avalanche joseki (see diagram.) But the best would have been to surround territory with 17 (see diagram).]
;W[db];B[lc];W[nb];B[fe]LB[hd:A]C[Note that Black 23 was sente! Or at least, it forced White 24. But then Black had to defend with 25 and 27, as he was worried about the invasion at A. So actually, you would have to say that the sequence from 17 on was gote for Black. White will get the opportunity to reduce Black's territory on the right.]

C[Black 37 shows good fighting spirit.];W[ip]LB[qr:A]C[White 38 is in the wrong direction, too close to White's own thickness. The key point here is A, making a base for the white group and threatening to attack the two black stones.]
;B[kn]C[The exchange of 38 for 39 helped Black more than White.]
;W[lo];B[ko];W[pj]C[White 42 is a bit of an overplay. Unless this becomes an effective attack on the Black stones to the right, it mainly serves as a target for Black to attack, especially as White already has a weak group at the bottom.]
;B[ph]LB[pq:A][ne:B]C[Black 43 would better be played at A, making a base for Black and stealing White's base. Even without the atari at 43, White is still vulnerable to moves like Black B.

More important, answering a move like 42 makes it light, because it was a free move. Ignoring it makes it heavy, because it was a costly gote move. So contrary to what you might expect, the best response to an overplay is often to ignore it.]
;W[qn]C[White 44 is a nice move! Black will have trouble countering this.]

;B[sn];W[qk];B[rl];W[rk];B[sm];W[pm]C[Ouch, Black came out of that poorly. He should go back and analyze those last few moves to find out why.

White should win this, if he can prevent Black from making too much territory in the center.]

(;W[fo];B[fm]C[White 74 is in the wrong direction, strengthening Black. There is a danger that Black will get enough in the center to win.

;B[pe];W[qb];B[pf];W[rf];B[pb];W[kp]LB[hc:A][pg:B]C[The natural move here is to transfer into the corner at White 1. Amaterus know this, but they see a huge ocean of black "territory" on the outside, and tiny white group in the corner. This seems favorable for Black. But pros look at this and say, "This was Black's corner in the first place. When Black pinched, he has three stones to White's one stone. I have to expect him to get a favorable result in this part of the board. I have territory I can count in the corner. That's not Black territory in the center, it's just thickness, and I know how to neutralize it. And I have the invasion at A, and the hanedashi at B to look forward to. And don't forget about the komi!"

Of course in this game, White is not getting any komi, but it's still best to forget that. If there is really a 1-stone difference in strength between the players, White can just wait for the win to come naturally.]
