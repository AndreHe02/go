AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hello, ph.  Thank you for sending me this game: it was very instructive, and interesting to review.  As you read this review, I'd like you to think about three concepts:

1.  Whole-board thinking.

Most of your moves seems sensible when you just look at the local situation.  Your next step is to plan your play across the whole board.  What is the purpose of each move?  How can you build a strong position?  Where is the territory  and potential territory?  It is important to break the habit of just reacting to the opponent's moves, and make your own decisions instead.

2.  Weak and strong stones.

If your opponent's stones are weak, you want to attack them.  If your own stones are weak, you want to defend them.  It's no use attacking or defending stones that are already strong!

3.  Sente and gote.

It's important to keep the initiative.  If you haven't met the word 'sente' before, you might want to read the article at Sensei's Library:

http://senseis.xmp.net/?sente];W[fc];B[df];W[mc];B[ic]TR[mc]
[fc]C[This is a good idea, as it prepares to attack either F17 or N17.  (Personally I think that J16 would be even better than J17, as it would be harder for white to counterattack, but at least you're playing in the right direction.)]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[db]TR[fc]C[Now you have a chance to make F17 into a weak stone.]

(;B[cd]C[This is the wrong direction.  See variation.];W[cb]
C[Now F17 is strong (because you can't cut it off from the corner stones), so it is no use trying to attack.]

(;B[he]C[See variations.];W[fe];B[gf]LB[oc:a][jp:b]C[This is gote (because it does not make a threat against white).  Better to play at 'a' or 'b' instead.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[of]C[(This is bad shape, as there is too much potential for white to invade near R12 later.  Better to play Q14 instead of P14.)]
;W[ib]C[This is a silly move: it threatens nothing.  You should ignore it and take sente to play somewhere else (K4 would be good).]
;B[jb]C[What is the purpose of this move?];W[jc];B[hb];W[id]
TR[ib]C[In this shape, you _must_ capture the white stone, either by playing J19 or H17.  See variation to the next move.]

(;B[hd]C[This is a mistake.  See variation.];W[hc];B[gc];W[gb]

(;B[ff]TR[gc]C[This is gote: white should now play elsewhere.

What was the purpose of your move at G17?];W[gd]TR[cc][cb][db]
[dc][dd][cd][df][ff][gf][fe][fc][gb][hc][hd][he][id][ib][jc]
[kc][mc][pb][qc][pd][of]C[Now all of the marked stones are strong: there is no good way for either player to attack in this area, and therefore no need for either player to defend.  The next move should be in a different part of the board.]

(;B[ge]TR[he][gf]C[This is gote, and it's also bad shape (the marked stones make an empty triangle).]
;W[cm];B[co]C[Good move.];W[bj]
(;B[ci]C[What is the purpose of this move?  The territory around D12 is very small: trying to defend is a waste of time.  And it's hard to attack the white stones while they can still run out into the centre.

White's move at B10 is low (close to the edge of the board).  This is an opportunity for you to build outside influence and play on a large scale. See variation.]
;W[em];B[fp]C[Good move.];W[ee];B[ef];W[bd];B[be];W[bo];B[bp]
;W[bn];B[bi]C[Again this is small--see comments to move 32.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[dl];B[fk]C[This is the wrong direction.  K4 is still the biggest point on the board.]
;W[bq]
(;B[ap]C[This move is only good if you can attack the white stones on one side or the other.  I don't think it works here.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[er]
(;B[eq]C[Here you should try and seal white into the corner.  See variation.]
;W[fr];B[hq];W[gq];B[gp];W[hr];B[iq];W[ir];B[jq];W[gm]C[Now you have sente again.  There are no weak groups that you can attack, so you have to ask: where is your potential territory?]
;B[mq]TR[pn][qn]C[This is the wrong direction.  The bottom area is open on the left--i.e, white can push in from J2--and white can still invade the corner (R3).  It would be better to play Q6 or R6 now, and maybe later you could play K2.]
;W[jf]C[I don't see the point of this move.  White should invade somewhere on the right side.]
;B[hk]LB[jr:a][qp:b][pn:c][ph:d][qb:e]C[This is a wasted move.  The territory around G11 is open above (white can push in from K14), so it's not good to try and defend here.  The big points are 'a'-'e'--choose one of those instead.]
;W[mf];B[qp]C[Good.];W[rp]C[This is a very strange way for white to invade!]

(;B[rq]C[Wrong direction.  You should try and keep white in the corner, so that you can take a large area above.  Maybe you can even kill the white stones.  See variation.]
;W[ro]
(;B[qr]C[There is no need to defend here.  White's stones are weak, and you can attack them forcefully.  See variation.]
;W[ql]
(;B[pn]C[What is the purpose of this move?  Where is your territory?  See variation.]
;W[rj];B[qi];W[ri];B[rh];W[qj];B[ph];W[pk];B[fl];W[fm];B[hm]
C[It is usually more effective to attack from a distance: J7 instead of H7.]
;W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[gj];W[fj]
(;B[ej]C[This is a mistake.  See variation.];W[fi]C[Now you must defend against the snapback.]

(;B[hi];W[ek];B[eh];W[oj];B[pi];W[hn]
(;B[in]C[Good idea, but there is an even better way to defend.]
;W[ho];B[hp];W[io]
(;B[jn]TR[oj][mf][jf]C[What is the purpose of this move?  It will be very hard to make territory in the centre.  Take your sente and do something else: see variations.]
;W[jo];B[kn]C[Same again.];W[kp];B[kq];W[lp];B[mn]C[And again.]
;W[lq];B[lr]C[Now the game is very close.  Try and count how much territory each player has.  I will give my own guesses with the next move.]
;W[mp]C[Black's territory:

upper right (around R14): approx 20
lower right (P2): 15
left side (B13): 15
centre: 5
total 55

white:

top (K19): 30
left side (B8): 12
lower left (B2): 7
right side (S7): 5
total 54

Of course, this is just a rough guess--a stronger player than I would be able to assess the position much more accurately.  But it's only half way through the game and white has already just about caught up.]

(;B[mr]C[O3 is a better way to defend.];W[op]
(;B[oo];W[no];B[nn];W[jr];B[kr];W[qn];B[oq];W[gi]C[This is a big mistake by white.  Try to see what white has forgotten, then look at the variation to the next move.]

(;B[hj];W[gg]
(;B[gh]C[Why?

Apart from the cut at G6, your best chance of winning the game now is to make some territory in the centre.  At the moment you have sente; see variation.]
;W[fh];B[hh];W[fg];B[hg];W[ji];B[ki];W[kh];B[kj];W[if];B[hf]
;W[go];B[jj];W[jh];B[nk]C[Good.];W[ok];B[nl]C[White has made a couple of slack moves (go back and try to guess which moves were bad), and now you ahve 15 points in the centre.  Perhaps you are a little bit ahead at this point.]
;W[fo]C[This is another mistake.  Now you hae sente again.]
;B[lh]TR[oj]C[This doesn't work, because of P10.];W[lg];B[mh]
;W[nj];B[mj]C[This move is gote.  Play R18 instead.];W[qb];B[rb]
;W[ra]
(;B[sc];W[pc];B[qd];W[od];B[oe];W[ne];B[nf];W[nd];B[mg];W[lf]

(;B[ad]C[Why not just capture the stone?];W[bc];B[ed];W[fd]
;B[eg];W[cj]C[Another mistake.  Stop and think what your next move should be.]

(;B[de];W[el]C[Let's count again.];B[aq]C[Black:

right side: 16
centre: 15
lower right: 15
left side: 13
total 59

White:

top: 45
left: 12
bottom: 7
right: 10
total 74

Go back and look at the last time we counted (move 109).  What has changed?

I will end the review here, as I don't see any big problems with your endgame.  Please go back and look again at the first 80 moves.  The most important thing you can learn from this game is to choose the correct direction of play.]
