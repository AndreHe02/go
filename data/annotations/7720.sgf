C[
Q: I'll mark my own post game analysis and questions like this.

P: And I'll mark mine like this. Hello! My name's Peter. I play go in hamilton, ontario, and on kgs, where I'm 3k. I try and not use too many japanese go terms, but any unfamiliar words can be found on sensei's library: senseis.xmp.net. I use b to refer to black, and w to white.

There are a couple of things I want to focus on in this review.

-direction of play, particularly in regard to corners/joseki. ill explain this term more as we go.
-attack and defense, meaning how to keep your groups strong while capitalizing on your opponent's weaknesses
-turning influence into territory

I don't talk too much about how to change the outcome of particular fights, because you can only get better at fighting by developing better reading skills (learning tesuji (meaning the 'right' move) can also help), which means solving lots of problems over at goproblems.com or elsewhere. So I focus on strategy in this review.

Ok! Let's go!];B[pp];W[pc];B[dd];W[dq];B[pe];W[rd]
(;B[rf]C[P: You asked a question on this move that somehow got lost in this file, but it was to the effect of getting flustered when your opponent deviates from joseki. And you said you were considering playing o16 next time.

You're right, ws16 is a very uncommon move, and i think it's not very good. it's not terrible, but it's slow while also being thin, which is a bad combination. But bs14 is a much worse move though. Playing the high approach at q15 means b is emphasizing influence in this corner, but playing a move on the 2nd line abandons that intention. if b had really wanted to make territory in that area, they would have needed to play on the third line to begin with.

A better response is to simply play the second approach at n17. This move is big and keeps b flexible, and it really emphasizes how slow s16 was. b would welcome w to try and extend along the right side -- with the q15 stone in place, w would be very low. See variation for what this might look like.

Every stone on the board has a direction. Stones on the 4-4 points ignore the corners to extend influence along both sides, so playing n17, with an eye towards extending to k16, means your stones are working together well.]
;W[nd]
(;B[nf]C[P: This is a bad move. It is too early in the game to give up sente with such a move. As well, the position b has created is very thin, meaning it has defects and cut points, and the right side below is wide open. w later exploits this, and these three stones become weak. w can happily play into the right side at any time, and it would take b several move to prevent that.

consider this variation.];W[fc];B[df];W[jd];B[pk]C[P: right. good move.]
;W[pn];B[qo]C[P: good. close the corner because you already have a pincer in place.]
(;W[pi]C[P: this move is an overplay, meaning that w tries for too much. unfortunately, b's ability to respond severely, with a move like o11, is limited because b is thin. I'll show a variation about that on the next move. If w wants to play this way, they must be prepared to give up q6.

variation here is a better move for w.]
(;B[qn]C[P: Here's a lesson that i once received from a reviewer. 

each turn, ask yourself these questions, in order

1) do my groups have any weaknesses? if so, fix them

2) do my opponent's groups have any weaknesses? if so, exploit them.

3) If no to both, then play the biggest point.

This turn, the answer to one is yes. The three stones around q15 are weak. if w simply o11 after this, then b is in serious trouble. r6 is big (altho far from the biggest), and is not urgent, therefore should not be played yet.

variations on this move for how to stabilize the q15 stones and prepare to attack.

In one variation, b plays a contact move against q11. this is usually a bad idea, because contact moves make your opponent's stones stronger, which happens here. However, it also shows a quick way to solidify the three weak stones. The other variation is more usual.]
(;W[ol]C[P: lol, i like the conversation you have with fbeb here :)

b got lucky that w played such a poor move here. by playing w q11, w asked b to choose which side of q9 b wanted to defend. by playing r6, b chose to fortify the bottom side, meaning that w is free to take the other side. with p8, w is being greedy and trying to take both, when they should really just be happy to have the bigger and more powerful upper section. See variation for how b could be in trouble.]
;B[ok];W[ni]C[P: b's position is less bad now because of the wp8/bp9 exchange. this made b much stronger without really helping w at all.]
(;B[do]C[P: remember -- 

Do my groups have any weaknesses? if so, fix them.

right now, the q15 stones are still weak. altho this move is big, defending them is more important. see variation.]
;W[nk];B[pl];W[nl]C[P: be careful... w is getting stronger with each new move in this area, meaning q15 gets weaker...]
;B[fp]C[P: b wants to build a wall to create a territorial framework on the left side. this is a good strategy. (however, only if we ignore the right side for now)]
;W[fq];B[gp];W[dj]C[P: as you probably know, the w joseki move is g3. when an opponent deviates from joseki, the deviation is usually a bad move. so the question then must be, how to punish that mistake?]
(;B[dl]C[P: there is a proverb that says, Play away from thickness. in this case, i would want to extend from the other direction, even tho it's smaller. bc12, to keep the two b stones at d16 d14 from becoming weak.

check out the variation.];W[bp];B[gq]C[P: this is a valuable point, but doing something around c12 is more important.]
;W[dh];B[ci]C[P: good move!]
(;W[bm]C[P : this is a weak move, but see variation for a dangerous possibility]
;B[bk];W[ck];B[cl];W[di];B[ch];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[db]
;B[eb];W[be];B[bf];W[cb];B[ec];W[ae];B[af];W[bd]
(;B[on]C[P: Ok -- b has come out of the right side with sente. It is a critical moment in the game. let us take a moment to assess the position. 

The game is very even, with both sides having a similar number of secure points, and being similarly strong. b has a weak group, but w has a group that could become weak.

So -- 

1) Do my groups have any weaknesses?

Well, the q15 stones still need some attention. Considering that b has sente and the wo9 stones don't have a base, b should be able to attack them and become stable in sente. One idea is shown in the variation, tho there are others.

2) Do my opponent's groups have any weaknesses?

The top side is wide open and ideal for invasion. Unfortunately, invading now would only weaken the q15 stones further. Otherwise, a play around m16 would make brilliant use of b's excellent wall. 
Also, w's o9 stones are floating, and therefore can be attacked.

3) Otherwise, what's the biggest point?

An extension from b's thickness on either the bottom or the top is huge. But I think the top is the biggest point.

p6 is none of these three things. It is spending yet a third move attacking the q6 stone. that stone is in no way important, and there is no way playing against it could ever be sente, because w played it as a throwaway stone.]
;W[om];B[pm];W[nn];B[oo];W[jp]C[Q: I was actually aiming for an extension in this area, but I thought I could get away with 53 first in sente (misread).

P: Yeah, a b stone would have looked great around there. :)]
;B[lp]C[P: Good. This move restricts w's extension, forcing them towards the thick g3 stones. If k4 tries to run, then b will be able to attack o6 as well.]
(;W[no]C[P: Why does w play this move? it only makes b stronger. forcing b to play at o4 and making a strong shape while w gains little. see variation]
;B[np];W[lo]C[Q: Things start to go horribly wrong here.  I don't see a way to keep white from invading (I've tried a few variations)

P: W got the first move into the bottom, so it is not reasonable to think about keeping w out completely. b's next move is super duper greedy and throws away the game.]
(;B[jq]C[P: Yikes! 

A common error is to regard open spaces where you have a lot of influence, like the bottom before wk4, as already being territory, then overreacting when an opponent invades. 

see the variation on this move.];W[kp];B[kq];W[mp];B[lq];W[mq]
C[P: poor b, this is no fun];B[nq];W[mr];B[nr];W[ip];B[iq];W[js]
C[Q: Monkey jumps always fluster me because I don't feel like I always respond correctly.  First move isn't too hard to figure out, it's the follow up moves that keep white from encroaching too far that throw me off.

P: Monkey jumps should always end in gote for the one who plays them, so this is a bad move. the jump is worth at most 10 points, less here because the territory in question is open. so bigger points are elsewhere, like on the top or attacking/defending q15]
(;B[lr]C[P: see variation for monkey jump guidelines.];W[ls]
;B[hs]C[P: this move is purposeless. it seems to want to prevent w from extending from k1 -- but, there is another w position on the other side of bh1! bh1 is not defending any territory in any way, it is simply a wasted move.]
;W[fr]C[Q: Very timely of him.  I'd have gone E3 next turn if he hadn't extended.

P: yes, that would have saved b a lot of trouble :)];B[gr]C[P: another wasted move. there are no points for b here.]
;W[gn]C[P: beware! b is now under attack! Look for ways to counter attack, like by splitting at h5. whenever at extension like j4 g6 appears, play in the middle of it! (OK, so it's not always a good move, but it often is.)]
;B[fl]C[P: this is a good move. it extends into w's moyo and improves the connection between the weak stones at the bottom and the stones around e8. it also makes the split at h5 more threatening.]
;W[bl];B[cj];W[dk]C[P: ok -- w split your groups in gote -- this means b gets the first move! h5 is critical here for transforming defense into attack. also, beware of the cut around e5. another move is very much needed here right now.]
;B[oi]TR[do][fp][gp][gq][gr][hs][iq][jq][kq][lp][lq][lr]C[Q: Originally I was aiming to build a wall on the right to try and connect the marked black group, which is now short on eye space.

P: hmm, im not sure i understand what you're saying. You wanted to build a wall on the right? w already has a wall there. and the marked stones are on the other side of the board and in urgent need of support. i think this is not a good strategy.]
;W[oj];B[oh];W[pj];B[me];W[ld];B[md];W[mc];B[ke];W[le];B[lf]
;W[ne];B[mf];W[kd];B[jg]TR[ke]C[Q: This doesn't work when the marked stone only has two liberties.

P: no, it works. l15 is sacrificed.];W[kf];B[kg];W[je]C[P: yup, now m12 to connect...]
;B[gj];W[ph];B[fh]TR[ck][dh][di][dj][dk]C[Q: I figure I've captured the marked white group, but I forgot about the weakness at B10.

P: oops! i do that too sometimes.];W[dm];B[em];W[cm];B[el];W[bj]
;B[bi];W[ak];B[fn]C[P: this is the sort of sequence that is easy to read out. It is pretty obvious that it ends in gote for b. also, it makes w stronger -- do not play contact plays on your opponents weak stones! it makes them stronger. b now loses the possibility of h5.]
;W[go];B[fo];W[nh];B[og];W[lg]TR[lf][md][me][mf][nf][og][oh]
[oi]C[Q: I realized here that my group is in serious danger.  Even if I connect at P14 I'll probably have a hard time forming eyespace when white blocks at S12]
;B[ri]TR[pe][rf]C[Q: Attempting to secure eyespace and/or connections for at least the two marked stones.]
;W[pg];B[gc]C[Q: I figure there's not much more that can be done for the group on the right.  In hindsight, Q14 or P15 would have been better.]
;W[fd];B[fb];W[gd];B[hc];W[hd];B[ic];W[he];B[jc];W[of];B[mg]
TR[lf][md][me][mf][nf][og][oh][oi]C[Q: This went mostly according to plan once I realized the group was essentially dead, and I sought to recoup as much of the loss as possible.

P: Like i said at the start, i'm not going to make much comment on fights. throughout the whole game, b wanted to play anywhere other than to support the weak stones in this area, and now those stones are killed. the mistake was made long before this fight started. not to say it isn't important to review fights, but the purpose of those reviews is to improve your reading ability, not just to find mistakes. there are no rules to fighting. there are special techniques called tesuji in japanese, which are patterns of stones that often recurr, but mostly, you just need to get used to visualizing different possibilities several moves in advance. the best way to do that is by solving go problems. check out goproblems.com. try and solve the problems in your head without clicking around to see the stones on the board. computer go breeds lazy reading that way.]

;W[pb];B[oa];W[pa];B[la];W[qj]C[Q: I didn't see a better way to block this off and/or connect.

P: all of b's last six or seven moves, all of the moves on the top, have been very small, none more than five points. b had sente after w surrounded the n14 stones -- it was b's privilege to play around r10 and connect the stones. but instead, b played small moves, ended in gote, and let w break the connection.]

Of course, if w doesnt play along the right side, b can r16 wr17 bs15 to get the wall pointing towards q10. but i think it's too soon for that as well (I'll explore some reasons for that in the main branch), so best to play elsewhere on the board right now.]
