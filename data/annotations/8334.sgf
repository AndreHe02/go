Hi, I'm Gus and I'll be your reviewer. I am sorry it took me so long, hopefully you will like the review. The story of the game is W had a weak opening, black was winning very early, then black converted 30 points of solid territory into 30 points of territory for white and white was winning. Then white returned the favor (approximately) in the lower left corner, and the game finished in blacks favor.]

(;W[mc]C[KEY MOVE, WHITE FALLS BEHIND. This seems loose. It puts mimial pressure on the corner, and lets black do whatever he wants.]
;B[jc]C[Now you have no good extension in either direction. White has trouble finding a good move now. From here, the sooner white can play elsewhere the better. You might even treat this lightly and play elswhere now.]
(;W[pb]C[This sort of low move is not really what you want to play in the opening.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[rd]C[Your group is almost settled, and can still run to the center.]

(;W[oq]SQ[rc][sc][qd][sd][qe][re][se][qf][rf][sf]C[KEY MOVE. WHITE MAKES 10 PTS, ALLOWS B TO MAKE 30. LOOSING MOVE #1 (white) This move is inconsistent. You gave up the marked territory securing your upper group. You must now find a way to get compensation by using the strength of your group Otherwise you gave away the 8-10 points for free.]
(;B[ie]C[opportunity lost. black is winning pretty big now. Black is nearly at 30-40 points on the board now, white has maybe 20-25. Ouch.]
;W[kd]C[This only helps black];B[jd]C[even harde to invade... but you got almost no points for it. Black clearly has a solid 30 points in the upper left now.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[gf];B[ge];W[ef];B[fg];W[eg]
(;B[gg]C[KEY MOVE BLACK LETS WHITE BACK IN: black trades one stone for 10-15 points of territory. Lucky you.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[ee];B[fc];W[ec];B[eb];W[dd];B[cd]C[Black didn't read again you are very lucky. Don't expect to get this kind of gift very often.]
;W[db];B[cc];W[fb];B[gb];W[ea]C[black gave away territory for no gain in gote. White has caught up, maybe even ahead now.]
;B[eh];W[gd]C[Well it *should* have been gote... un believable.]

;W[ci];B[cj];W[bi];B[bj];W[bf];B[dk]C[black has big thickness, white ahs a hUGE corner. The entire game now depends on blacks ability to use the thickness (which looks pretty hard).]
(;W[cb]C[black is already dead. This move is -1 point in gote.]
(;B[cn]C[bad for black. Never play near thickness when open space is plentiful. To do so is inefficient and painful.]
