Hi,
I'm Scaerloc, and I'll review your game.

General commentary :
It's quite good, you see things clearly, and you hve good ideas.
The the things that both of you missed were the cutting points and the timing for attack.
Just remember three things :
       - Cut whenever you can. Divide to reign.
       - Attack quickly when there is an opportunity, a thin wall for instance.
       - Do not try to settle in your opponent's territory.
If you keep that in mind, I'm sure you'll become stronger!

See you, and continue to enjoy go :-)];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd]LB[jc:a]

Well, I never played the next move (R5), so...
As white, I would play a, so as to prevent black from playing K16.
b would be a mistake, I guess.]

At this point, there are two filiform groups (square and circle), with two cutting points (triangle). 
Those points are the focal ones.
Both players must take the control of those points, so as to make the life uneasy for his opponent : when you can, cut.]

This is not a moyo.
This is a weak group that has to struggle for life.
Your moyo is in the bottom left corner (and this is a huge one !),
