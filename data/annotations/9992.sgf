;B[pd]C[[DrK: Hi pcesar22. I am reviewing your game. 

I will focus on your play (white side). 

I will also answer your specific questions at the end of the game.

I find the 4 questions of go strategy helpful in assessing a move at your level (frankly also at mine). Have a quick read before reading this review:

Enjoy!

(;W[qn]C[[DrK: overplay - Q6 maintains stone connectivity.\]]
;B[rn]
(;W[pp]C[[DrK: Another possibility is R7 which is more active.\]]
;B[qm];W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[pk];W[qq];B[rq];W[ro]C[My idea with this cut was to invade his territory, but my reading of it was shallow, and I understand there's no point to it at this time.

[DrK: you are correct here. Should be left for later.

A lot of tactical motifs only occur due to low amount of liberty for groups of stones. If at the end game there is no way to reduce black stone's liberty count without letting black profit then simply play Q2 or even P2 at the end game is even for both side to close off the gap here.]
;B[rp];W[rm];B[so]
(;W[ql]C[[DrK: if by now you are aware your tactic does not work there is no point in playing any more stones. R8 is a "thank you move - forcing black to reinforce itself which it has to do at some point anyway.

I note if R8 was not played S8 can potentially be played at the right time - if there is a group of stones invading at top right corner - that can separate black's groups.\]]
;B[pl];W[pr];B[rl]
(;W[qs]C[[DrK: too small - white's side is already closed off - should play the bigger points.\]]
;B[pq]
(;W[rk]C[[DrK: another thank you move - bottom right is loss to white - white's only play now is R12.\]]
;B[sm];W[qq];B[rr];W[pq];B[rs]C[[DrK: black played badly here - white somehow closes off bottom right corner without any issue - the last few moves are frankly very small.\]]

(;W[cg]C[[DrK: 
1. too close;
2. if your aim is to make big enclosure then G14 is better (questionable direction).
3. not make use of D4 - which is too far away to assist if there is a fight.
4. if this is a pincer it is not effective. Pincer is effective if it forces opponent to run to the centre. But in this case even if black cannot attack C13 effectively it can play say C18 for a base. As such, pincer move in this situation should be played after white plays C18 and black does not respond first.\]]
;B[eg];W[di];B[cq]C[[DrK: I shake my head here - black's 3-3 invasion here makes no sense - it is a "thank you move to white. White needs stones to enclose the bottom left and bottom part of the board - black can get some territory but white can usually close off black completely with huge influence. Black can easily make base at d9 or c6.\]]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cr];B[br];W[er];B[cs]
;W[bm]C[I believe this might have been an overplay. Standard joseki says 3 connections

[DrK: yes - C7 is better both in standard response and overall in this game. D2 is also playable but it does not assist in connecting the 2 weak white stones at D11 and C13.

I note in general, a group of connected stones of at least 3 is much stronger than 2 in e.g. c6.\]]
;B[cm];W[bp]C[Yes, pointless... I know

[DrK: it is not pointless - at the right opportunity A4 can be played. However, it is a waste of a possible ko threat.\]]

;W[en]C[I knew I didn't have the ladder but I did not want to concede him so much territory. While I'm satisfied with this play, I'm wondering if there was a better option

[DrK: black wins heaps here - white stillll have weakness in stones that can be disconnected - see  different variations to white earlier.\]]
;B[al];W[jp];B[lp]C[He places this right next to my strength, so I feel like I should use it, and try to push him towards my wall]

(;W[ln]C[I know the standard is a knights move, but I was afraid that would have been too slow, allowing him to escape. I think this part of the game is where I was weakest.


[DrK: I would just play M3 since white's stone K4 is at 4th line; yes knight move is possible if white stone is at 3rd line K3.\]]
;B[ko]
(;W[kp];B[lo]
(;W[kn]C[[DrK: this move is odd to me - if you want to push a group of stones you need to push it to the right direction. In this game you want black to run out of the centre and white to solidify area along the way. So L6 which pushes black to white's area contradicts this.\]]
;B[jo];W[io];B[jn]
(;W[im]C[[DrK: overplay - J6 is better when you have a few groups of weak stones close to a strong group (connected) of opponent stones.\]]

C[I feel like I have a ton of center influence, even though my walls are thin.

[DrK: too many weaknesses - so many places to disconnect... marked with x. White has to deal with them. Most concerning of all - Q2 is without a base and is the most urgent to fix e.g. M3.\]]
;B[jj];W[jm];B[of]
(;W[nf];B[ng]C[Now I understand what the center stone was for.

[DrK: again O15 group is not important - white can sacrifice it...\]

[DrK: also K10 is bad black is overplaying by heaps - M4 group needs to be settled or white could potentially kill it... why oh why it did not play k7 as soon as possible...\]]
;W[mf];B[nh];W[lf];B[oi]C[So I feel like this could have gone better. Had I seen the ladder, what could I have done differently?

[DrK: one needs to identify when a group of stones must be saved and when not.

1. stones to be saved - it keeps opponents' stones disconnected; necessary for a group to live
2. stones that may be sacrificed - live or die it does not affect the life death status of groups close by for either side.\]]
;W[gf]C[I feel this move was very strong

[DrK: agree. However it is not the most urgent.

Most urgent is moves that settle P3 group of white stones which may become without a base...\]]
;B[ch]C[I really wanted to play D12 but I felt like consolidtating the top was more important]
;W[le];B[nj];W[mi]C[[DrK: now should play d12 - N11 is for stones that may be sacrificed...\]]
;B[ok];W[mm];B[mn];W[nn];B[mo]C[[DrK: I shake my head here - black should not play here but L3...\]]
;W[lq];B[mq]C[Now I can really smell the death of this group... but then....]

;W[gj];B[hk];W[il];B[ik];W[ll];B[km]C[I think this is a mistake, so this makes it easier for me. My only weaknesses are these E8 and M6 groups... with this move I don't think M6 is a problem anymore, but I am still not sure about the top part]

[dj][ej][ek][el]LB[fn:1][lq:8][nq:6][lr:7][js:2][ks:3][ms:5]
[ns:4]C[And then I lose on time... This looks very scary for me, and it looks like it might be a close race. So I have a few questions about this game.

1) How do I proceed to chase an invasion such as his? What moves I could have done better?

[DrK: a. invasion, pincer, life and death are fact of life in playing go. One has to be aware it can happen and try to anticipate what to do.
b. invasion works if it can live or it can run to the centre without letting the opponent getting too much profit.
c. Inversely, if you are defending against an invasion try to pincer and push the invading stone to the strong wall - by pushing I mean keep the invading stone away from your big area so you can secure it. You defend well if the invading stone runs out to the centre and you can both chase it and get territory at the same time.
d. Most of the time it is not possible to completely kill the invader - don't over fuss in killing.\]

2) How do I analyze positions such as these? Is this just reading? I feel like I might gain enough liberties on the group in order to make sure I can kill him before I get killed myself, but this seems reaaaaally far into the future.
The only thing I can kind of predict is that he has 8 liberties (See numbers) and if I don't kill anything, that's the amount of liberties I need to create, which doesn't look too good I would think.

[DrK: yes it is all about reading. However, when I play blitz games I don't bother reading - my spidery sense tells me if I am doing something right if I get most of the below:

a. keep my stones connected;
b. keep opponent stones disconnected;
c. avoid stone groups that are 1 or 2 - thin is usually bad unless you have to because you are behind in score/power;
d. does a group of stones matter - is it disconnecting opponent or keep opponent from coming in my territory - don't just fight for something without thinking.\]

[DrK: conclusion - frankly in this game both sides have heaps of mistakes. I think they are:

1. assume the opponent plays at the most important area of the board - and chase after it. Fight for stones that should be sacrificed - both sides do this a lot. 
Remedy - you will get better as you get stronger. But a book I can recommend is "How Not to Play Go" by Yuan Zhou which I found helpful.

2. reading ability - I think playing with tsumegos (heaps of free collectio) will really help you.

3. how to attack and defend - you were particularly concerned about how to deal with an invasion. Also how to play the bottom right corner correctly. Sensei library has a section on it that is helpful. The book "Attack and Defence" Elementary Go Series discuss this in great details.

Hope this is helpful.
