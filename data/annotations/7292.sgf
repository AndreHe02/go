C[P: Dear reviewer, when playing against stronger players I am loosing groups while defending others. So please advise me how to get a better balance in the opening, so that my groups get a solid base. I've been reading some books where was stated that urgent moves are more important as big moves, but I seem to miss very urgent moves. Can you the urgent moves I missed.

R: Hello, my name is paco. Im 5k in KGS. I will start my comments with R (Reviewer) instead of P because you start yours with P

Your mean mistakes are:

1. Sometimes you make very little moves
2. In some important moments of the match that there is a fight, you dont calculate the position, and you don't see he can kill. I use to play quickly, but in that moments I stop and calculate it till the end. Yopshould do the same
3. When you attack you should think what are you trying to get with the attack]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo];W[jq]C[6 P: Was it better to play 6 at c15?
R. Yes, or D15. D17 is a move that is played to make a corner enclosure, and you don't do it.]
;B[ce];W[fd];B[cj]
(;W[mq]C[R: I see this move as a small one. In this moment of the game people tend to seek influence in different parts of the board, attack or settle the groups. Since K3 is not weak yet because w can play N3, g3 or k5, I would have let this move for later. Or play f3]
;B[ef]
(;W[qj]C[12 P: Alternatives g3 or l17?

R: If you want to play near g3, play  f3. You dont need to be so near to k3, because k3 is settled

You mean L17? Is good. Beause is well relationated with both F16 and Q16. R10 is not bad.]
;B[nc];W[lc]C[R: Pincer is a good response since you dont have a stone in k16 and you want to extend from f16. But L17 is a better extension and is still a pincer.

Q14 is also a good move, in relation with R10];B[ne];W[pf];B[qc]
;W[pc];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc];B[re]C[R: Memorice the sequence of the variation. Is very usual.]

(;W[ng]C[R: In this case, you have decided to atack o15 instead of playing s14. You shouldn't attack thinking about killing, but to chase trying to take advantage.

The territory you are maping while chasing o15, is precisely the one you are relinquishig not playing s14 and letting him in. Is better to attack from the other side]
;B[ld];W[kd]C[R: ¿Do you know what sabaki is? If black is in your territory, he plays in contact with you, seeking fight. He's ready to sacrifice some stones to scape, capture or to make eyes. In this cases, white should do the oposite. L17. not letting this cutting points]
;B[le];W[ke];B[kc]
(;W[jc]C[R: I think is the wrong direction, since you should be concerned about M17. If M17 is alive, you should have no prolem in killing L17, even you could after kill o15 too.

Its difficult to calculate all the variation, but in general you should try to link your groups and to separate his. If he has two separates groups triing to live, he will have poblems.]
;B[kb];W[lb]C[32 P: better at k18?

R: Its difficult for me to tell how could it end, but if you play k18 you are signing a peace contract in wich he has more territory han you. If you are loosing, you have to be agressive.

I see m18 as an very agressive move. You separate him and now he must fight to win. The problem is that you started a fight and you resigned to calculate and to see all the possibilities. M14 was your very bad move.

In fights tou have to calculate!!!!];B[jb]
(;W[lf]C[R: Maybe you are so lazy to read all the positions, but in this case is specially important to read what can happen upside before playing M14]
;B[mb]C[R:Now the match is over. You should't resign yet, but is very difficult to win]

(;W[nb]C[R: why are you doing that? The situation now is that you have loosed the game. You need to revolutionate the match. Is this a revolutionary move?]
;B[mc];W[ic]C[R: And this? This is very little. Are you going to change the situation with this?]
;B[kf];W[qm];B[gq];W[cn];B[cp]C[R: You see? He's playing in a conservative way because he has already win. He don't want to loose nothing]
