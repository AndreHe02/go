PL[B];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[ep];W[gq]C[This pincer works well with Q4.]
;B[gp]C[The black moves at F5 and C3 are more common, but G4 is also playable.]
;W[hp];B[go];W[fq];B[lq]C[Black must separate the white stones at E3 instead.]

(;W[nq]C[White should play E3 instead (see variation).];B[iq]
C[Peeping like this is generally not good because white is happy to connect. Do not force a connection when you might want to cut instead later.]
;W[hq];B[ip];W[io];B[jo];W[ho];B[do];W[dq]C[white has a better position. Black has two separated groups and will not be able to defend both of them.]
;B[eq]C[Black could play C5 directly. Black does not gain anything with E3 and D4; these moves could be kept as potential ko threats for later.]
;W[er];B[dp];W[cr];B[co]C[C5 is very big, but black still has a weak group on the bottom.]
;W[ec]C[White could instead attack the weak group at the bottom.]
;B[de];W[cb];B[ci]C[B C11 works well with the C5 group, showing that white E17 was not a very good idea.]
;W[cl]C[Black is too strong in this area, white should not invade so deep. White could consider a reduction at D10 instead.]
;B[bm]C[Black should attack at E8 or D9 instead. White would be in serious trouble.]
;W[bl]C[White overplays. W should escape first.];B[cm]C[Black could attack at E8 instead.]
;W[el];B[ej]C[Black should probably play G8 instead.];W[gm]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[dm];W[ek];B[ck];W[cj]C[Good. Black makes some points by capturing C8 but severely damages the top left.]
;B[bk];W[bj];B[al];W[dj]C[Now black E10 becomes a wasted move.]
;B[di];W[gn]C[G6 does not achieve much since the left black group is already alive. White could attack the bottom black group instead.]
;B[bi];W[fp]C[F4 does not gain anything for white, so it should not be played. It could be kept as a ko threat for later. Also, black is likely to ignore the threat now, and white should not play two moves to capture only two unimportant stones at this point.]
;B[fo]C[Black should have ignored the threat.];W[fn]C[Once again, white plays a move which does not achieve much and could well be ignored. Do not play atari just because it is legal to play it; play it only when it really helps you and is really forcing.]
;B[eo]C[Defending at L4 is probably bigger than playing E5. White has now recovered from the premature invasion at C8.]
;W[ql]C[The corner is still open at R3 so R8 is not as big as it looks. White could keep the initiative by attacking the bottom black group.]
;B[rp]C[Black can indeed invade, but the weakness of the J3 group will be a constant worry.]
;W[qq];B[qn];W[pn];B[qm];W[pm];B[rl]
(;W[qk]C[White could instead play patiently at Q8 to attack the bottom black group later (see variation).]
;B[rk];W[mo]C[N5 is not a strong attack. Black can simply defend at L4 and get good shape.]
;B[lo]C[Black should play L4 instead to get good shape.];W[ln]
;B[mp]
(;W[np]C[White could attack more strongly (see variation).]
;B[kn];W[lm];B[in];W[hn]C[Black was able to invade on the right and save his bottom group at the same time. This is not a good result for white.]
;B[qf];W[hc];B[kc];W[mc];B[ld];W[md];B[me];W[ne];B[nd]C[Black can capture the two white stones, but this will severely damage the corner, so black should play more patiently.]
;W[od];B[nc];W[oc];B[nb]
(;W[oe]C[White should play more agressively at Q16 (see variation).]
;B[pd]C[Black is happy to defend now.];W[og]C[White could play P18 or Q18 sente before P13.]
;B[nj];W[pi];B[qj];W[pj];B[pk]C[White is stronger than black in the center, so Q9 is an overplay.]
;W[pl];B[ok];W[mf];B[le]
(;W[lh]C[White could also play more agressively at M10 (see variation).]
;B[lj];W[kj];B[ki];W[li];B[kk]
(;W[jj]C[White should play N10 instead (see variation).];B[ll]
;W[km];B[mi]
(;W[mh]C[White should play K9 instead (see variation).];B[jk]
;W[ij];B[jm]C[Black is now connected.];W[jl]C[White does not achieve anything with K8 except reducing his own liberties and making a cut at N6 even more severe.]
;B[il];W[kl];B[ik];W[ml]C[Again white does not gain anything with this atari, so it should not be played.]
;B[lk];W[mk]C[White wastes another potential ko threat.];B[mj]
;W[qi];B[mn]
(;W[mm]C[White could instead sacrifice the center and capture the black right group (see variation).]
;B[no];W[nm]C[Black has made profit in sente and white has an ugly shape.]
;B[oo]C[Black does not gain much by playing P5, unless it is followed by S3 to attack white. Otherwise this is another wasted ko threat.]
;W[po];B[fe]C[Black should attack at S3 instead.];W[fj]C[White S3 is much bigger and sente.]
;B[ei]C[Black should still attack at S3. The E10 stone is not essential currently.]
;W[jb];B[kb];W[jc]C[White should still play S3 instead. In the top area, white should play P18 or Q18 or B17 sente. K17 is gote so it is small.]
;B[jd];W[id]C[J16 is gote. White could play B17, P18 or Q18 or S3 instead.]
;B[je]C[K15 is a slow move, not sente. It could be useful to attack the P15 group, but white has S10 and K12 so this group is not in danger. To defend against white P18 or Q18, black should play directly at P18 which is bigger than K15.]
;W[ie]C[J15 does not achieve much and is gote.];B[jf]C[K14 does not achieve much. White is happy to answer at K12. In other words, the K14-K12 exchange is favorable for white only so black should play somewhere. To defend the top group against the Q18 threat, black should play P18.]
;W[jh]C[Now white Q18 becomes a serious threat.];B[kg]C[Another wasted ko threat.]
;W[kh];B[dc];W[db];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[ed];W[eb];B[gd]
C[G16 is very very small (one point in gote). B should play P18.]
;W[hd]C[H16 is also very very small. S3, B17, P18 or Q18 are much bigger.]
;B[he]C[Yet another very small move in gote!];W[if]C[White is already alive at the top so W does not have to connect, and J14 lets black defend at P18. White could attack at Q18 directly instead of J14.]
;B[hf]C[Still small and gote. P18 is much more important.];W[hg]
;B[gf]C[Look how many stones black has invested in this area just to make two points (F16 and G15)! Black should defend at P18 anyway.]
;W[gg]C[White should attack immediately at Q18 instead.];B[fg]
C[Black should again defend at P18 instead.];W[pb]C[Excellent point! Black is in big trouble and should lose at least one group on the top or on the right.]

(;B[qc]C[R17 makes an ugly shape (empty triangle), and gives up the L18 group. But B cannot resist at R18 or P18 either (see variations).]

(;W[qb]C[White could capture all the top immediately with N18 (See variation.) But R18 captures the top right so it is a good move too.]

(;B[rc]C[This gives up the L18 group (see variation) and does not completely ensure the life of the right group.]

(;W[rb]C[This is risky because it still leaves a chance to save all black groups. White N18 would ensure the capture of the top (see variation).]

(;B[pe]C[Black should save the top group with N18 (see variation) and hope to save the right groups later. Q15 does not even completely ensure the life of this group.]

(;W[pf]C[White should capture the top group with N18 instead. Alternatively white can attack the S8 group in sente. (See variations).]
;B[mb]C[Now B has a chance to save all his groups, since W has to answer at P18.]
;W[ob];B[qg]C[R13 does not ensure the life of the black group.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[re]C[Good! B should die.]
(;B[qh]C[B should simply connect at S10 to try to attack the bottom W group. R12 doesn't help B at all.]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[ph];B[pg];W[of];B[oh]C[B should keep this move as a potential threat for later.]
;W[oi];B[or]C[It's a good idea to attack the bottom, but B must start with S3 instead of P2.]

(;W[nr]C[W should answer at S3 instead (see variation).]
(;B[rr]C[S2 is an overplay, B must play S3 instead to kill white (see variation).]

(;W[qr]C[W must push at S3 instead (see variation).];B[rq]C[Now W is in trouble.]
;W[qp];B[ro];W[lr];B[kr];W[ls];B[os];W[qs]
(;B[ns]C[B could try N2 instead but W lives (see variation).]

(;W[mq]C[Big mistake! W should play N2 instead (see variation). This error should cost the game for W.]
;B[mr]C[Good.];W[oq];B[ms];W[pr];B[ks]
(;W[op]C[Clearly W has only one eye at most, so P4 is hopeless. But O9 does not work either (see variation).]
;B[nn];W[om]C[It seems that W won on time, but B just had to answer P10 to kill white and win.

There have been many upsets in this game. If you had to retain only one lesson from this game, avoid useless moves which don't help you at all but help your opponent. In particular do not play atari unless you really gain something from this.]
