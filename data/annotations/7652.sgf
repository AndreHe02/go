AB[pd][dp]C[Hi reviewer, and thanks for your time. There are many comments and variations I left for you. I signed them with 'Remi :'

This is a very serious game played in a tournament.
White (me) is 1k in France, and 2d on KGS
Black is 3k in France

I won this game very fast, and had the feeling of playing very well. What is your job, then ? Well first, I'll send the review to black, so he'll be happy to have his mistakes reviewed. Second, I suspect there are some overplays in this game, I'd be glad if you could have a look at three key moments of the game (which was very short, indeed !)
- One is at move 12, where I played very thick, but had the feeling of being a little overconcentrated.
- One is at move 28, where I left a weak group undefended, but my opponent failed to attack it correctly.
- One is at move 37, where I invaded although I had a weak group nearby]

White knows black likes to build moyos, so he plays moves that reduce black's potential. This strategy turned out very good.

>Good. A, B or C are other options. D is not urgent any more because it doesn't threaten an invasion, but it will be big later.]

That's usually bad to approach on that side

>Good direction of play from black - the top moyo is more important than the corner.]

Essentially, white won because of superior technique. Black's big moyo strategy was excellent, but during the fighting there were a few questionable moves - the wedge at L15, the odd shape at P12, then P10 and L10 - which meant that white never seemed to struggle at all, when in fact black should have had excellent chances.

Black would do best to watch some high dan games, keeping an eye on the shapes and seeing how they use influence to gather profit (mostly without killing).

It's harder to review for white, but perhaps there wasn't enough respect for black's influence. A stronger fighter would certainly have made white pay for having two weak groups on the board.

I hope this helps. If you have any questions, just email or catch me on KGS ("sixsix")

Actually, there were a couple of fights because white is an unreasonable man who still takes risks even when he's ahead. (in my brain, it's like : "you're ahead, just count and find a way to win the game easily", but I'm so excited that I can't count, and I continue fighting. :)]
