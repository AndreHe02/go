C[In this game, you were the better close quarters fighter. You were also better at life and death. Fuseki-wise you two were about the same. The primary difference was in middle game strategy and techniques. Frequently you misused thickness to help your opponent. Also, you several times played to give your opponent good shape and frequently made bad shape yourself. Your primary weakness, then, is in the basics of attack and defence, and the basics of making shape/destroying shape. The book "Attack and Defense" would then be highly recommended for you, and you could improve greatly once you understand the direction to attack from (away from your wall, pushing the opponent into your wall). Also, Kageyama's Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go has a chapter on shape, that would be good for you. Additionally, there's the book "Making good shape" that may be a little advanced, but that would allow you to improve greatly.]

[dr:A]C[The most common responses by black are A, B, or C. See variations]

(;B[jq]C[Since you have the star points on the 4th line, this move seems flat.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pc]TR[qf][qg]C[This is not common without an existing extension at one of the marked points, since it is too vulnurable on bottom.]
;W[kc];B[qg]C[Now you play the extension in gote. Consider the variation.]
;W[nq];B[pq]C[Same as before, except white exercises his option to invade the other side.]
;W[qn];B[rp];W[qk]C[This is to black's benefit, white's helping black solidify, and white's not much stronger for it.]
;B[qj];W[pk];B[ok];W[ol];B[pl]C[This seems too premature, white's only trying to make shape inside your territory, and this lets him sacrifice to do so. The variation shows how.]

(;W[oj];B[nk]C[White again plays to black's advantage by making many weak groups.]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[qm];B[pn];W[qo];B[po];W[qp]C[So far black has mostly played well. And black's mistakes were not capitalized on by white up to around this point. Black is going for the kill here, so black doesn't want to let white have S5 in sente. See variation.]

(;B[qq];W[ro]C[Now white gets this in sente.];B[rq];W[rj];B[qi]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[lq];B[si];W[sk];B[rl];W[rm]C[Now, look at the board. White's m3 stones are alone, weak, and pressed up against your wall. So attack them in a way that uses the wall and doesn't make them stronger.]

(;B[np]C[This move, however, violates the rules of thickness and attacking. You're touching weak stones.

http://senseis.xmp.net/?DontTouchWeakStones

And you're attacking from your wall instead of towards.

http://senseis.xmp.net/?PushTheEnemyTowardsYourThickness

This only lets white make shape. If you can grasp the fundamentals of how to use thickness to attack, you will improve quickly. Especially if you favor the san-ren-sei style. The middle game is where you started to lose the game, and some understanding of influence is fundamental to the middle game.

See variation.];W[mp]C[Now white has shape and it's going to be very very hard to kill. Additionally your stones to the left are weaker now. White can attack at H3 soon.]
;B[no];W[jp]C[Now white can press against your weak stones to make more shape. White loses the opportunity to attack these stones in so doing, but also strengthens his own.]
;B[kp]C[Read this out before you play it. In the game you saw that this can't work, so it's better to not play it at all than to play it when it doesn't work.]

(;B[eq]C[Bad shape.

http://senseis.xmp.net/?Shape];W[hc]C[So at this point black is probably a bit behind, but white is very invadable, so the game's not over yet. This move is also very odd by white, F17 would of been much better.]
;B[cg]C[I'm not sure what the idea behind this move is.];W[ce]

(;B[ci]C[This is too small and helps white too much. After white plays C10, black's in trouble. See variation.]
;W[cj]
(;B[di]C[There's a proberb: "Hane at the head of two stones" This move allows white to do just that. See variation for better moves. That hane gives white good shape and you poor shape. See the variations for better shape moves.]
;W[ei];B[ej]C[This doesn't help the D11 stones, it only makes the weaker.]

(;W[ek];B[fj]C[I'm not sure what you want here. I thought it was to have D11 be a living group. You're making multiple weak groups that white can attack and kill.]

(;W[fk];B[fi];W[eh]C[Now black has to sacrifice D11.];B[fh]
;W[eg]C[Sacrificing D11 now isn't too bad an idea,];B[fg];W[ef]
C[Losing D11 was big, but the games not over yet. Black can use his new influence to try to get center territory.]
;B[bj]C[Better to save as ko threats.];W[bk];B[ck];W[dk];B[bi]
;W[cl];B[bf]
(;W[hj]C[White is willing to let D11 live now to attack F10. It's black's decision.]

(;B[gk]C[This move does nothing for your F10 stones, only makes them weaker. It's better to make some semblance of shape. See variation.]
;W[gj];B[gl]C[Yet again, black weakens his stones to make more weak groups.]
;W[hg];B[gf];W[hf];B[ge];W[fd];B[he];W[ie];B[id];W[hd];B[jd]
C[And black has too many weak and dead groups to live. The rest of the game is white making many fighting mistakes, allowing black to close the gap.]

;W[gi]C[More mistakes. This all shows me, however, than in close combat fighting, you're stronger than your opponent. So the game came down to shape and how to use influence.]
