C[Hello,

 My name is Kevin, and I am white with no komi. I lost the game by a half point. I am interested in anything and everything you might have to say. I left a few questions. Thanks for your help.]
;B[qp]C[kevco: hello and good luck];W[dq]C[ToShio: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.]
;B[pc];W[oq];B[op];W[np];B[oo];W[pq];B[qq];W[kq]LB[jq:A]C[Both are ok
A might be a bit faster but it has a defect on M3];B[qn]C[Black's last move was much too slow
Sould've been at r10];W[ce]C[This move is very good, it works efficiently with the komoku on the lower side and if black invades at d17 you can bring him into a low position with e16]
;B[jc];W[do];B[qe];W[dc];B[cm]C[ok to this approach there are two responses, one is at e6 and another one is pincer most frequently played at c10. In this Position e6 looks bad because it's too lash. So pincer no matter which one is good.]
;W[ck];B[em]
(;W[dh]C[Ok now there is fight between black and white. The marked stones looks like it wants to say: "No thanks I don't want to fight although that was my territory before." But in this situation you have to make some pressure on this group with e9. That doesn't mean that you've to kill or capture some stones but that you get some profit out of this invasion.]
;B[bo];W[fn];B[fm];W[gn];B[bq];W[mn];B[cr];W[dr];B[jo]
(;W[jn]C[There is Proverb which says don't touch what you want to attack. And you really want to attack this stone, because he deaply invaded your territory and I would even say this is overplay.]
;B[kn];W[ko];B[kp]C[cut and atari is bad. But this is black fault. But stretch is better.]
;W[lo];B[in];W[jp];B[io];W[ip];B[ho];W[hp];B[go];W[gp];B[fo]
;W[jm];B[en];W[qj]C[No the direction is okay but maybe you should have played one above because the group in the lower side is very powerful.]
;B[qh];W[ql];B[je]C[Black lost an opportunity to attack this group.]
;W[oi]C[good move];B[og];W[mh];B[mf];W[om];B[fc];W[qr];B[rr]
;W[pr];B[rm];W[rs];B[rq];W[qc]C[This was only for additional time, I had 3 seconds left and one move to play.

I see];B[qb];W[fd]C[I don't know what the best move on the board for white should have been.]

;B[jh];W[ki];B[ds];W[es];B[cs];W[fr];B[da];W[ri];B[rh];W[aj]
LB[cb:A]C[Yes you should have responded because the corner territory here is bigger than the territory on the side.]

[qo][ro][so][rp][sp][aq][sq][as][bs]C[Ok That was my review. Very important for you is to work at your fighting ability.Often you're very shy and you want to have a compromiss but sometimes it's important to fight, there is no fault that if you fight and die gloriously but if you lose by some points and later on find many opportunities to fight and win. ByeBye]
