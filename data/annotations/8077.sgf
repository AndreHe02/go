C[Dear Reviewer,
Thank you for taking the time to review this game for me.

I was playing black and lost. I don't think I played particularly bad, or at lest I don't think I made any glaring mistakes, but I felt that I was playing catchup from the beginning of the game.

I'd be most grateful if you could suggest or provide advice on choosing josekis, the opening, invasions, and direction of play.

Once again, thanks.

Hi,
There were'nt big tactical blunders as you said, so maybe you should focus a little more on strategy: which groups are weak, how should I protect them or how can I take profit from my opponentes weak groups. Should I invade, or reduce.
The biggest problem, in my opinion, is that you should try to play more flexible. See the examples in the game. I know that it's eaysy to say, but  try to get a feel for it, by watching games of stronger players, or reading something about it.

Good luck,

Frank];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[po];B[oq]C[I don't know of any 5-4 josekis and I was unsure how to answer it. I should probably have just played kakari at c6, but I felt that something similar to the 5-2 invasion (aiming to slide into 3-3 or out to 8/9-4 position) would be better to prevent w from making a lot of territory in the corner.]
;W[pq];B[op]C[F: I'm not so sure about joseki's myself, but this  can't be good after white connects his two stones. I suggest that you look up the unknown joseki after your game (Kogo's dictionnary e.g.), that will give you ideas how to respond better in the future.]
;W[pp]
(;B[kp]C[F: Better push one (at least) more, Q5 is too nice for white. Variation]
;W[oo];B[no];W[nn];B[mo]C[F: Now you've got a very cramped position, and white has a very nice corner]
;W[iq]
(;B[ip]C[I guess k3, j4, l6 (or j2) might have been a better play for black, but thought thas as I wasn't getting much territory on the bottom, I should aim for keeping white low and making a wall for influence.

Would tenuki for a larger point such as k16 have been better?

F: K3 would be very submissive indeed. Another idea would be M7 tot get in the centre and prevent a white move on N6]
;W[jq]
(;B[jp]C[F: This is very bad. You're not making any territory, you're just connecting one stone.
Variation];W[hp]
(;B[kq]C[F: This is contradictory with your decision not to make territory by playing K3]
;W[fq]
(;B[cq]C[I think this was badly timed, but I was worried about w making a huge territory on the bottom. I guess again k16 would have been better...

F: Indeed, or another big move on the sides];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo]
;B[bq];W[cn];B[er];W[eq];B[fr];W[dq];B[dr];W[gr];B[bs]C[Was this unnecessary? I didn't like the shape that would be left if w haned on both sides..

F: I think it's alife without this move. After the game you should try yourself what happens is you don't play here.
The difference is big of course, because now white has sente]
;W[qf];B[qh]C[F: Since's white strong position on the bottom right side, maybe better a high pincer?]
;W[of];B[nd];W[rd]

(;B[mg]C[F: This doesn' connect your stones!. Be more flexible. Variation]
;W[ng];B[nh]C[F: Now white takes sente again];W[fc]
(;B[ec]C[I chose this because I didn't want to pincer and play too close to my own wall and f15 seemed to be in the wrong direction of play. Unfortunately this joseki just gave w good shape because of the position of the wall and the cut at m17. Could you give me any ideas on how to respond to this kakari?

F: This joseki doesn' t work good here, that's right. Let's have a look at some variations]
;W[fd];B[df];W[jc];B[hd]C[F: What's the purpose of this move?  You're making white stronger]

;W[fb];B[eb];W[ch]C[It was around this time that I realised I was either losing or had already lost. I felt that I was just being pushed around the board.

F. You just made whites group alive, and got in return as good as nothing. The influence you made is annilihated by the cut at K15 which is left]

F: Yes];W[dh]

I really appreciate it.])
