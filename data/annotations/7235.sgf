AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, and thank you for your help,
I played this game as black and lost. Then I played the same player again and I won, but this loss is  much more interesting becuase of the large failures I had.
Thanks again,

Hello.
All comments are marked like this text - by square brackets at the end of the comment.
\]];W[dd];B[pp]LB[qp:A]C[[Broege:
personally I would like to play some more territory-oriented move when having handicap - like A - but it's rather a matter of taste.
\]];W[cn]
(;B[fq]LB[fp:A]C[I'm most interested in opening play, so I hope 6 was ok...

[Broege:
The move played is joseki, however it's a bit defensive.
The more common answer is at A, see the variation for one of the most common patterns then.
\]];W[dl]C[[Broege:
This is a strange move - White needs to stabilize its stones here, not to run away.
\]]
(;B[mq]LB[fc:A][pj:B]C[[Broege:
I prefer to attack opponent's corners rather than to try to close own corners - at least when a corner cannot be closed with a single move, as is the case here.
A stone at 4-4 point is usually played to have influence rather than territory - so you should extend much further from it as extending closely will not close the corner from the opponent and nor will it create much influence.

Here I'd recommend playing A (see the variation with same joseki as at the lower left corner) if you prefer to be in control or B if you prefer playing defensively and waiting for your opponent to decide what's next. Of course usually it's much better to decide on your own.
\]];W[jq]
(;B[ip]LB[fc:B][cf:D][pj:C][jo:A]C[I liked my move 10... was it ok?
Eveyone at the club says I play too slow :)

[Broege:
I would ignore the White stone just played. Black groups are pretty safe and the White stone cannot do you much harm - it will never gain enough territory and will have to run anyway. Playing somewhere else has the advantage of choosing your own path rather than responding to the opponent's move - and from all my experience the simplest way to loose a game is to respond to every move of your opponent.
Black possibilities are almost endless. Personally I would play B or C, or (if in too much of a fighting spirit) D.

If you feel like attacking you can also try a capping move at A - White can probably still escape but Black can gain something else in progress. Please see the variations for some of the possibilities.
The move played is also OK - especially if followed later with more strong attacking moves.
\]];W[kp];B[qj]LB[mo:A][ip:B]C[[Broege:
Ah, you have to be consistent with your plans.
If your aim is to attack the two White stones - why not play A? This leaves White only one path of escape and strengtens Black corner at the same time.
If you don't want to attack - why play B at all?
\]];W[iq]LB[mp:A]C[[Broege:
And now White did slightly punish Black for ignoring the previous move.
\]];B[hp]LB[kn:A][mp:B]C[During the game I was thinking "I want to cap that invasion, but how?".

[Broege:
You simply can't.
White can play A to escape immediately or B to push some more into the corner and escape a move or two later.
That's why I recommended ignoring this White stone - it does not gain territory for White, it already took what could become Black territory - so why bother with it...
\]];W[hq]
(;B[gp]LB[fp:B][eq:C][gq:A]C[[Broege:
I'm not sure if you could ignore the White move altogether but for sure Black could play at A - see the variation.
Here White can play A and Black will have to defend the cut at B by playing C. Such details can sometimes decide whether a game is won or lost as they allow your opponent to use your weaknesses for own profit (usually for living where you could've killed).
\]];W[mp]C[***With white 17 I fail  to cap and it seems like this is where I lose the game.

[Broege:
As I mentioned before, White was not possible to capture (and certainly is not possible now). I don't think it lost you the game - in fact I'd prefer Black in the current position.
\]];B[np]LB[nq:A]C[[Broege:
Playing at A would be safer and simpler - it may turn out that Black will have to worry about the cut at A.
\]];W[mo];B[pm]LB[qm:B][qn:A]C[[Broege:
This seems bad shape to me.
I assume this move was supposed to take some territory. For this I'd recommend playing at A or B.
Black corner still does not look safe - although I cannot find any immediate way to exploit it.
\]];W[lq];B[mr];W[lr];B[oq]LB[np:A][nq:B]C[[Broege:
Now Black pays the price for playing A instead of B - White managed to create some eye-space while Black had to defend. Now White is safe and Black has nothing more than after playing B.
\]];W[no]
(;B[oo]C[[Broege:
This is one of the more common mistakes many people (including myself) do when playing stronger opponents - unnecessarily answering moves that look like forcing moves but are not.

Imagine (or see the variations) what worst could happen if Black ignored White and played elsewhere for own profit or attack.

When you manage to do that it's enough to remember the trick during the game and make such an exercise before playing own move. With time one can learn to ignore more and more opponent's moves and playing own moves that the opponent cannot easily ignore.
\]];W[nc];B[qf]LB[pf:A][qj:B]C[[Broege:
Again - typical joseki answer is at A. Here it's even better as the B stone is already present (see the first variation of the game for the most typical sequence) so Black will end with sente.
\]];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]
(;B[qe]LB[pe:A]TR[nc]C[[Broege:
The cut at A may prove costly, it's simpler to play A now and attack the marked stone as soon as the corner sequence ends - see the variation.
\]];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb];B[mc]LB[oc:A]C[[Broege:
This is a mistake which White promptly took advantage of. Just connecting at A is OK - it leaves White cut in two.
\]];W[nb];B[oc];W[nd]LB[pe:A]C[[Broege:
Now the cut at A may have proved much too costly - see the variation.
Black would like to cut White in two (otherwise White corner is safe and influencing the centre) and it needs the ladder to work. But this means that White can play in lower-left corner for (almost) free.
\]]
(;B[fc]LB[oa:A][pa:C][pe:B]TR[mc]C[I'm guessing that 40 went too far?

[Broege:
Imagine White playing A now:
- White corner is safe
- White corner is connected to the centre so it can influence the rest of the game
- Black marked stone is virtually dead
- Black will most probably answer this move as otherwise White B kills four more stones (it's not that important as White is already connected but may be hard to resist even for a 15kyu player)

Black should thank White for not immediately punishing the move just played.

The correct move is at A (if you want to let White live in the corner) or C (if you don't mind a ko for the corner). But the important mistake in this region was two Black moves ago - now three White stones are much too strong.
\]];W[kc]LB[oa:A]C[[Broege:
White is too defensive now. After A, no matter what Black plays next, White will rule the upper side.
\]];B[ic]LB[oa:A][pa:B]C[[Broege:
This move is OK locally but playing at A or B is still urgent.
\]];W[jb];B[md]LB[oa:A][pa:B]C[[Broege:
This move is of not much use.
White can still connect all his groups and Black is trying to rescue a stone which is not important while leaving open weaknesses in its own position. A or B is still much more important.

From now on I'll ignore the situation top-right corner and comment on other moves from the tactical point of view.
\]];W[mb];B[ne];W[oa];B[dc]LB[db:A]C[[Broege:
If Black wants to create more eye-space diving at A is preferable - it cannot be cut and can easily be followed with 3-3 point if ignored.
\]];W[hb];B[hc]LB[gb:A]TR[ic]C[[Broege:
It's best to leave the marked stone and concentrate on securing some eye-space for the corner stones. Otherwise Black creates a wall which points to the centre but is not safe as it's cut off from the edge. It may yet turn out that such a wall will die.
\]];W[gb];B[gc];W[cc];B[ed];W[de];B[ch]C[[Broege:
This is quite brave. Perhaps stronger players would call it an over-play but I'd play it myself if in fighting mood.
\]];W[cj];B[be]LB[bg:A]C[[Broege:
Good. Usually White could cut at A but here White stones are too weak and White needs to think about defense first.
\]];W[db];B[ec];W[bg];B[cd];W[bd];B[ce];W[bb]LB[cf:A]
(;B[df]TR[cd][be][ce]C[[Broege:
As the ladder does not work it's best not to start it at all. Either Black finds another move (see the variation) or accepts the fact that the marked stones are dead.
\]];W[bh];B[cp]LB[df:A]C[[Broege:
The ladder at A does not work - so perhaps it's good to exploit a mistake by White and kill those two cutting stones immediately?
\]];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[ff]TR[dc][ec][fc][gc][hc][ic][ed]C[[Broege:
Pushing White like that means only that the marked Black stones will soon be surrounded and dead - which actually happened in the game.
\]];W[ge];B[gf];W[he];B[hf];W[ie];B[if];W[jd]TR[df][ef][ff]
[gf][hf][if]C[The sequence from 69 to 79 was clean to me when I started but I didn't know what to do. It seemed like a smaller failure on my part than what I did when I failed to cap on the other side...

[Broege:
I cannot agree.
Now the board seems like Black could resign - White has the top and most of the left side, Black has most of the right side and a bottom-left corner. Moreover the marked Black wall has no eyes and may yet need to escape.

The "failure" to cap the invasion at the bottom wasn't in fact much of a fiasco - White was unkillable there.
On the other hand the sequence just played forced White to capture 7 Black stones along with some extra territory while Black gained nothing.
\]];B[nm]LB[nj:A]C[[Broege:
If Black wants to create some more influence (or wanna-be territory) I'd recommend playing bolder and greater-scale moves like A - Black is already trailing and needs to find some magic fast or the game is lost.
\]];W[ib]C[[Broege:
I don't understand why White played this move - it was completely unnecessary.
\]];B[jf]LB[kg:A][mi:B]C[[Broege:
Perhaps some faster moves like A would be better to close of more of the potential territory.
On the other hand White can easily invade as deep as B (and perhaps deeper) so there is not much actual territory in those plays.
\]];W[jj]C[[Broege:
White is very patient and does not invade too deep. There may be a chance yet for Black.
\]];B[km]LB[mj:A]C[[Broege:
It's better to fend of some territory now - White will rather take care of its stone so Black needs to push it outwards from its pottential territory.
The move played does nothing for Black - it does not connect the groups on the right side and at the bottom (not that they need to be connected) and it does not surround any territory (actual nor even potential). It's best not to play moves in the noone's area.
\]];W[jn];B[mm]C[[Broege:
Much to slow. White can invade deeper as the tengen stone still has much room to escape to the left side.
\]];W[jm]
(;B[ik]C[[Broege:
Again - Black should not push White into its own (potential) territory. The sequence played only strengtened White stone into quite a big wall while Black weakened its own top group and created another weak group in the centre.
If I were to point one biggest mistake of the game it would be the sequence starting now - it destroyed any hope Black could've had up until now.

See the variation a for how an attack from the other side could look like. Of course it would be even better to start it a move or two ago.
\]];W[jk];B[ij];W[ii];B[gj];W[hi];B[gk];W[gi];B[il];W[jl];B[im]
TR[le][lf][lg][di][ei][fi]C[[Broege:
Now the Black is in very serious trouble.
White can easily cut at the marked places and yet another big Black group will die.
Black also needs to connect its centre group to the bottom - which may not be easy if White plays correctly.
\]];W[in];B[hn];W[cg];B[dg];W[cf];B[ei];W[ci];B[fi];W[dh];B[eh]
LB[bo:A][gr:B]C[[Broege:
Somehow White allowed Black to connect all weak groups.

From now one there are only sporadic comments as the game turned into a series of tactical errors and thus is hard to comment constructively.

In theory at this stage the game should enter its end-game phase and moves like A or B should be played to enhance territories. This however is rather uncommon at the double-digit kyu level (and indeed I often forget myself to play end-game moves as soon as possible) so there will be almost no end-game comments, except for some obvious cases.

[Broege:
I hope my comment will indeed help you to play better.

As a final comment a number of more generic advices based on what I saw/understood from your game:

1. Try to directly answer your opponent less frequently. Of course this is not the aim in itself - but if your opponent plays a move and you feel urged to answer it immediately, try to rethink it and check what can happen if you don't answer it at all. Quite often you will realize that you cannot lose as much as you can gain elsewhere.
This applies to both the opening game and the later stages, including end-game.

2. Try to solve some (even easy) life&death problems to improve your reading. I recommend goproblems.com site which has many problems for each level. I think that for your game the most important part of better reading would be to play stronger moves when answering forcing moves by your opponent.

If you can find a move which will deny your opponent any more follow-up moves you will notice that your groups are getting stronger and cannot be easily attacked. Sometimes is worth to give your opponent a point or two in exchange for a stronger shape of your own group so you don't have to take care for it later.

3. Try to watch out for big groups getting much weaker due to some fight going near - this way you can decide to sacrifice the smaller (or less important) group if you find that one of them must die. If you look at the game now you can see that two big Black groups (both marked) died just because they were not taken care of when getting weaker.
