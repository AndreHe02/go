C[Hello, my name is Rüdiger Basche and I am the reviewer for your game in the GTL. I am currently playing mostly on DGS, where I have a rank of 7k, which might be a bit high, on KGS I am currently 8k, which micht be a bit low :-).I will mark my comments with the prefix RB.
As a general remark, after having the first impression of the game, it seems to me that, despite of the lower rank, white is the stronger player, as black often missed to make a necessary move, which I did not observe in this extend with white.
Also, I think that both players need to learn that go is a game of making territory, not of capturing enemy stones :-)
Additionally both players need to have a look into dead and living shapes.
I hope you will find the review helpful.];B[dp]C[RB: Noting to comment on the first few moves]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[cd];B[qf];W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[qe];W[qd]LB[qg:A]
[qj:B][jc:C]C[RB: Upto move 10 there is no special comment. After move 10 black should defend his weakness at A, the common joseki continues here with black B, white C.]
;B[cf]C[RB: Tenuki like black 11 is leaving this spot open, black 11 is an error.]
;W[ec]LB[ci:A]C[RB: White 12 is a standard answer, Black should extent to the other side to give his stone 11 a base to be stable, this is done usually by a 2 stone extension to A. With black 13 at A both sides have a stable position and can look out for more profit on the board.]
;B[ee]C[RB: I regard black 13 also as an error. It is not giving black a solid base and the pressure upon the top white is neglectable.]
;W[ch]C[RB: White 14 is one possible way to continue, a pincer attack rendering the black group without a base and eyes, I think black is already in trouble here.]
;B[cj]LB[eh:A]TR[ee][cf]SQ[ec][cd]C[RB: a fight starts, outcome yet unknown :-) From the general perspective, when white jumps out to A, the black group marked with a triangle is in trouble. The white group marked with a square looks stable and secure.]
;W[eh]C[RB: As expected];B[gc]LB[fd:A][fc:B][dc:C][ed:D][fe:E]
C[ludamad: explaining is too much work
paulalom: heh
paulalom: i forgot
RB: I do not understand what black expects from his move, it is a third, weak unconnected, single stone group, the open gap at A is staring at white calling out "seperate black" :-)
Better on my mind would be to go to close combat at black B, then possibly white C, if white is peaceful, white D if white is up to fight..., then black A, then a white cut at E, leading to a complicated fight.
Black 17 is trying to kill a white group which can not be killed. It gives no support to the running white stones and even weakens the to black stones by the answer it provokes with white.]
;W[fd]C[RB: playing in the gap is a must for white here];B[fe]
;W[gd]C[RB: always keep your enemy seperated, white is following this rule]
;B[hd];W[ge];B[fg]C[RB: black needs to defend here with 23, his group is still not stable]
;W[df]LB[eg:A]C[RB: white tries to cut with 24, but I do not like this move. I probably would have played at white A instead, still rendering black eyeless and beeing a bit more connected and stronger for the fight.]
;B[de]LB[ce:A]C[RB: now, when white cuts at A, black will capture stone 24, giving him space for 1 eye.]
;W[ef]LB[ff:A]TR[ch][eh][df]C[RB: I am not sure about the quality of white 26, it provokes the black connection at A , but at the same time it creates a very stable form called the table form (marked triangle), which gives whites group a good fighting position.]

(;B[ff];W[ce]LB[cf:C]TR[de][ee][fe][ff][fg]C[ludamad: Im trying to split you even if it makes weaknesses
paulalom: im debating giving up that stone
paulalom: but im looking at connecting to my c10
ludamad: e13 then c13 seems natural
paulalom: but c13 isnt good if its going to die anyway so im only going to play that if i can connect
paulalom: ill do e13 probably regardless
paulalom: cant connect
ludamad: yeah
RB: the Black stone at C is lost, there is no chance to save it. Black must be happy to be able to run with his big, eyleess group (triangle) into the open. White has alreay conquered the top left.]
;B[eg];W[dg]C[paulalom: i want to enclose bottom left
paulalom: but i need to protect top left noiw
RB: white 30 shows the strength of the table, it can not be seperated.]
;B[hg]C[RB: black nees to run, without eyes and without territory]
;W[he]C[paulalom: im okay with this
paulalom: builds strength in the top
RB: no black strength in the top, black still needs to defend on 2 fronts]
;B[id];W[ie]C[RB: whites stragey is sound, keep black seperated, the center group is big and weak.]
;B[jd]C[paulalom: i can run in two directions
paulalom: with my top left group
ludamad: yeah
paulalom: i cant let that wall go too far though
RB: black not yet stable with both groups];W[lc]C[paulalom: if it gets more than another stone or two you can cut me off at h11 maybe
ludamad: i shouldnt have let those stones get strong
paulalom: im not sure the best way to respond to this
paulalom: i want to pincer
ludamad: pincer seems suicidal
paulalom: but i think im just going to settle
RB: white 36 is a strong move, taking away room from the weak top black group and giving territory to the right white corner.]
;B[kb]LB[kc:A][fc:B][je:C][ed:D]C[ludamad: making a base is standard response
RB; playing on the second line is bad style, it is the line of loosing, i think black s option would have been better A, B, C. A blocks on the3rd line, but gives not yet 2 eyes, B threatens to cut at D, If white connects at D, A would give 2 eyes, C seeks the center.Black 37 is an error.]
;W[kc]C[RB: white 38: good, black has so many weak groups without territory, I would prefer to play white from now on.]
;B[jc]TR[hb][hc][ib][ic]C[RB: Black 39 does not look good, there is a dead form in it, I mark it with the triangle, if white manages to bring black to this shape, black is dead.]
;W[lb]C[ludamad: trying to make territory in sente
paulalom: trying to determine if i can ignore that move
paulalom: i think i can
RB: I think black can not ignore the move, white is right, territory in sente]
;B[fq]LB[qj:A]C[Black 41 is a big move, yes, and sound if he is willing to let the top side go, though I would pave played around A to secure the black stones on the top right]

(;W[je]C[paulalom: i think i can ignore that move
RB: Black 41 is big, white 42 threatens to kill blacks upper group, black must react now]
;B[qn]LB[qg:A][mk:B]C[RB: Black 43 is big too, but it does not protect the still open weak point at A]
;W[kd]TR[eg][hg][de][ee][fe][ff][fg]C[paulalom: i cant ignore that
RB: lets see if black still lives. Black also still has a weak group (triangle)]
;B[ib];W[ka]C[RB: white reduces blacks eye space, this is an endgame move normally, but here is a chance to kill.]
;B[jb]LB[qj:A][cm:B][jp:C][fh:D]CR[hc]C[paulalom: that might have been bad
paulalom: i dont think i needed that move
paulalom: er
paulalom: i needed some move
paulalom: i dont know if that was the best way to do it though
RB: balck 47 is an error, it looks tough for black on the top. 
A better play for black is to play on the red circled point to create eye space.
What is best here? I think it is best not to try to ride the dead horse.
Let the dead group die. Play elsewhere. Protect one of your weak spots, I mark the possible moves I see: A-D
White has won the top side, but the board is big and open at other spots, and a weak group needs to be saved. My priorities would be:
A: Make big territory to the right, protecting your weakness
B: Make big territory to the left, protecting your weakness
C: Make big territory
D: Protect your weak group];W[gb]LB[qj:A][cm:B][jp:C][fh:D]
C[paulalom: shit
paulalom: i think im dead
paulalom: lol
ludamad: yeah
ludamad: i was happy just with the surround
ludamad: but i do need territory
ludamad: i dont like your large corners lol
ludamad: im also afraid of having to respond to an invasion on the right right now
ludamad: cuz if you develop the center
RB: 48, the killing move, no chance anymorefor black here, Black: Play A, or B, or C or D]
;B[hc]C[ludamad: you have most of the game potential];W[fb]
C[paulalom: i was hoping youd make a mistake
ludamad: life and death too ez
paulalom: im looking for complicated ways to ruin your corner
paulalom: im stopping that
paulalom: lol
ludamad: stopping what?
ludamad: that its too easy?
paulalom: i mean
ludamad: gave up?
paulalom: im not going to waste time trying to kill your top left
ludamad: Lol
ludamad: top right
ludamad: imo
ludamad: but
ludamad: from outside
paulalom: thats more endgameish
ludamad: or make another move like c7
ludamad: or d7
ludamad: yeah its later i guess
RB: Let me speak it out, black is telling rubbish, trying to talk white into defense...]
;B[dm]C[paulalom: i read your text after i played
paulalom: lol
ludamad: lol
ludamad: i give benefit of doubt
RB: white now to enter to bottom or right];W[kq]C[RB: white 52, excellent move, whit has 2 options to extend to right or left, depending in blacks answer, allways making a base]
;B[mq]C[ludamad: I have to try to reduce];W[hq]C[ludamad: no other strategy
paulalom: im okay with this because it lets me solidify my right corner in goaty (intentional exaggeration of my lack of knowledge of japanese spelling)
ludamad: gote];B[gr]C[paulalom: heh
ludamad: do you mean sente?];W[hr]LB[qj:A]C[paulalom: no
paulalom: gote is response
paulalom: sente is initiative
paulalom: except
ludamad: er
paulalom: i didnt look them up
paulalom: lol
ludamad: gote means changes of initiative
paulalom: oh?
ludamad: a gote move
ludamad: lets the opponent respond freely
paulalom: gives up sente
paulalom: ye
paulalom: okay
RB: instead of 55, black should play around A];B[lr]LB[qj:A]
C[paulalom: further strengthening of my territory
RB: the key play for both is around A];W[ej]C[ludamad: need to develop center potential
ludamad: attack from outside
paulalom: debating whether to kill your potential for eyes or to keep you seperated
ludamad: relying on large knight move
paulalom: also need to protect top left
ludamad: being unsound kinda
ludamad: im not too worried about eye potential
ludamad: i imagine befing forced upward
paulalom: was considering g5
ludamad: i want to surround you while threatening attack
ludamad: your moyo is pretty formidable
paulalom: even g6 is good
ludamad: g5 is ok if you dont care about extensions from e10
ludamad: g6 looks weird
paulalom: two large knights its probably fine
paulalom: more directly seperates you
paulalom: and easier surround at k6
ludamad: i would try to play under
paulalom: if you extend at h10 i have to respond with k13
ludamad: and threaten both attack and extend both ways
ludamad: maye
ludamad: maybe*
paulalom: attacking your eyes doesnt gain me much if you can just run
paulalom: i feel that to be a waste
ludamad: here yes
ludamad: usually you want to prop them up
ludamad: but only if they are a danger in your side
ludamad: i cant grow

RB: Funny: The discussion is not about the weak point on the right
White: either respond to 57, it is threating to destroy your base here, or play on the right, 58 has no real meaning]
;B[hj]C[paulalom: im thinking
RB: 59 is running with a weak group, white's strategy should now be to threaten to keep it weak (and possibly kill it) and try to make the bottom safe.]
;W[dk]C[paulalom: if you large knight to f7
paulalom: i small knight to seperate at g5
RB: white just provokes the answer which strenghthens black left. I do not like white 60]
;B[ck]C[ludamad: im trying to pry your large knight
paulalom: its not in danger
ludamad: it was sente
paulalom: yeah];W[dl]C[RB: same here, black is solid to the left now]
;B[cl];W[em]C[ludamad: simple
ludamad: playing on top
RB: Black has to think again about his center group, it is growing bigger and bigger and is neither seucrly connected to an other group, nor has it eyes yet.
Whites strategy: give territory to the left, keep the center weak?]
;B[go]C[paulalom: sacrifice some territory to keep you seperated
RB: Black: Huh, keep whom seperated from what? Save your center group please!
65 is not really good.];W[gh]LB[qj:A]C[RB: 66 is not reall good either, the big point is (still) around A]
;B[gg]C[ludamad: prying
RB: white: dont try to kill to soon, it is about territory, not killing. Black still can fight back. Close combat is not for killing but to make eye space, killing is a move from a distance.
Close combat is for defense, attack goes from a distance.];W[hh]
C[ludamad: /attacking];B[ig]LB[ih:A]TR[fh][gh][hh]C[RB: Black is not usin its chance to fight: instead of 69: Black A: treatening to kill the triangled stones, when white defends with B, play 69 and black has a much better running/fighting position]
;W[jg]LB[ke:A][ih:B][fh:C]C[RB: 70: error, what shall this move do? The cut at A can be ignored. Better play at B or connect at C]
;B[ih]LB[qj:A]C[paulalom: this doesnt bother me
paulalom: gives me a better surround
ludamad: yea
ludamad: it wasnt great
ludamad: i didnt like
ludamad: my jump
ludamad: k13
paulalom: ah
paulalom: yea
RB: Black needs to run and fight, it is the desire to create confusion to be able to find a saving move, white 70 helped him., the spot at A is still open.]
;W[ii]TR[gh][hh]C[ludamad: i feel an impetus to keep you from connecting
RB: White gives black a chance to cut and create confusiuon. the triangled stones only have 3 liberties, after the cut only 2, immediate danger!]
;B[hi];W[ji];B[jh]C[RB: Black better go through A and catch the seperating stones]
;W[dn]C[RB: Black has so many open points, he cannot defand all.]
;B[cm];W[eo]LB[qi:A][ok:B]C[paulalom: this is the territory i sacrificed for g5

RB: the right side is still open...];B[do]C[RB: Black is not sacrificing some small territory, he is giving up the left side including 5 prisooners, more than 20 points! and G5 is noting...]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[co]LB[bo:A][bm:B]C[RB: Better play at A, white, black needs to defend at B (and has his stones not yet safed, then play 82, and either spoild the black corner or kill the left side stones.]
;B[cp];W[bo];B[bp];W[bm];B[bl];W[an]C[ludamad: i enjoy this
RB; it looks nearly like the dead black top now...];B[bi];W[bh]
C[ludamad: its in trouble
ludamad: imo
paulalom: yeah
ludamad: shoulda played
ludamad: d13
ludamad: er
ludamad: c13
ludamad: and then
ludamad: c12
ludamad: hm
ludamad: though
paulalom: you had c12
paulalom: a long time ago
ludamad: b12
paulalom: that wouldnt have worked
ludamad: yea
paulalom: until i had the b11 stone
paulalom: thats why i played it
ludamad: i was thinking you could make complications
ludamad: but no
ludamad: so my territory is looking pretty big now
ludamad: almost time to switch style of play
ludamad: but nah territory wise you're still ahead
ludamad: though i get capture points
paulalom: those are huge points
ludamad: compared to if those groups lived for sure
RB: white is huge ahead, the top is totaly white nad has 9 black cpatives, around 40 points, the lef side is more than 20 points, blacks center is weak and not yet alive, the left side is still open
Whites bottom left and right are together around 60 points also, the odds are for white.]
;B[di];W[ei];B[dh];W[cg];B[fh];W[fp]C[RB: I do not see the usage of white 96, play to the big point (right side)]
;B[ep];W[gp];B[fo];W[en]C[RB: this sequence helped black, white has 1 eye and must struggle to get the second.]
;B[gm];W[ho];B[hn];W[in]C[RB: small play and giving black the changes to cut, error on white]
;B[io];W[hp]TR[gm][hn][fo][go]C[RB: black must fight, white is giving away its advantage, if white is lucky he can catch the triangled stones, if not, the lower side becomes black]
;B[jo]C[RB: black 107 is a good and strong move, seperating the white bottom group from the rest. The white group is in danger, all what black must do is to strengthen is 2 cutting stones further.]
;W[hm];B[gn];W[il];B[hl];W[im];B[gk];W[ik]C[ludamad: center looks low scoring for now]
;B[ij]C[paulalom: yeah];W[jj]TR[gh][hh]C[RB: wild fights, white is giving away its strategic advantege by allowing black to make fights for live and death of huge center groups, black just needs to capture the 2 traingeld stones and the bottom is black and white then has a weak group in the center.]
;B[jk];W[hk];B[gl]C[paulalom: if g12 wasnt the way it is i would have lost h11 lol
ludamad: yea
paulalom: i missed that
RB: white has lost the center and is now in a bad position, a real pitty, the open right side is still there, but with a strong black center a play there becomes more and more dangerous for white, odds are turning.]
;W[kk];B[jl];W[jm]C[RB: a ladder which white should not win]
;B[kl];W[km];B[ll]C[RB: I do not believe that white can save his stones, the game has turned now in favour of black]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[ln];B[jn];W[lm];B[lo];W[kp]TR[kn][io][jn][jo]
C[ludamad: verdict?
paulalom: you just won by a lto
paulalom: lot
ludamad: this games been very hard fought lol
ludamad: i mean
paulalom: yeah, and go is pretty much win by an inch win by a mile unless youre a pro
ludamad: yea
ludamad: well
ludamad: blunders happen
RB: blacks triangles tones are dead!!! That turns again the odds to whites favor!!! Oh oh, what a game of unused opportunities!]
