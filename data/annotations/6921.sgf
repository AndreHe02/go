C[goword [4k\]: hi

hey Reviewer,

i want to thank you in advance for reviewing my game.

i played this game on kgs with 15 or 20 min time limit and 30 seconds byomi.

Imagist:

In the opening, you should seek moves that both help your position AND damage your opponents' position.

In the middle game, keep track of weak and strong groups.  Don't let your groups become weak, and don't help your opponents' groups become strong.

In the endgame, always consider ignoring your opponent's move.  If you can find a more valuable move than responding, play that move.]

;W[pf];B[of]C[Imagist: This move will strengthen white.  It is better to simply press at M16.]
;W[pg];B[fc]C[is this something i should not do? would c14 have been better? i wanted to create some pressure on n17

Imagist: You need to settle your group on the top right.  You can do this without taking a loss by pressing at M16.]
;W[jc]C[Imagist: White creates a strong group between black's two weak groups.]
;B[db]C[Imagist: You can jump into the corner at C17 or pincer at C14.  This move is not severe enough, and black's group will be too narrow.]

;W[if];B[le]C[the following sequence is unfamiliar for me. normally things move an other style. but i dont see a mistake.

Imagist: Pressing against white's group is a good idea.];W[nd]
;B[pe];W[qe];B[qc];W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[ne]C[Imagist: This is not necessary; it will strengthen white.  Better to jump out to O12.]
;W[kd];B[ld]C[Imagist: Strengthening white again.];W[lc];B[mg]
C[Imagist: Too slow.  Better to jump out to O12.];W[ia]C[Imagist: This is a mistake: white can play H18.]
;B[hb];W[qj];B[qm]C[Imagist: Too slow.  C12 is an active move that is both an attack on white, and has a good relationship with D3.]
;W[jq];B[co];W[mq];B[oq]C[Imagist: This is a valuable move for black, but not for white.  G3 is a good move for white, so it is better for black to take H3.]
;W[gq];B[cl]C[Imagist: Too slow.  Black needs to extend farther to C12.]
;W[ci];B[bj];W[bi]C[i saw the outcome of the last moves in the lower half as good for me

Imagist: Black lost the entire bottom side and didn't get enough value for his corner moves in exchange, so the bottom is a (slight) loss for black.]

;B[dj];W[ch];B[nb];W[mb];B[fp]C[is this okay? i was aiming at creating some territory on the left side and gaining some influence to the center and pressing w down.

Imagist: You can do more by attaching at G4.];W[gp];B[go];W[er]
;B[dr];W[eq];B[ep];W[fn];B[ho]C[Imagist: Good, you can't afford to connect here.]

;W[hn];B[fo]C[Imagist: It would be better to play at K6, sacrificing the three stones for superior outside influence.]
;W[jm]
(;B[il]C[i think this was a mistake. breaking through at k5 would have been better. but i am not quite sure, because later the group around h8 is under pressure and with w j8 it would have been much harder

Imagist: This move is correct; black cannot allow white a ponnuki in the center.]

;W[dg];B[jk]C[Imagist: It is better to connect at M11.  This removes weakness from both of black's group.]
;W[nr]C[Imagist: Black should not respond to this, but should play S9 for mutual damage.]
