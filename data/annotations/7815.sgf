;B[pd]C[P: IÂ´ve won this game but I think I`ve make many mistakes and there are some things that I don't see very clear

Hi, Paco I will let my comments start with a *.

In the opening I think you got far behind. During the middle game it  started to tilt in your  favour however you did miss few oppertunities then to decide the game. 
It was only of some mistakes of black in the endgame you did win.

It looked like that during the opening you followed black's move and during the end-game it was the opposite black followed all your moves. 

I do think that the opening was the weak point for you in this game middle and end game was good. Suggest to study the opening especially the direction of play.]

;W[fd]LB[hc:A][nc:C][id:B][pj:D]C[P: I think this is better than d14

* I think D14 is a bit too passive as well, but there are other options like A, B or C as well. However you will get a totally different game.
The downside of your choose is that you end in goto and your opponent gets to play D. Optically black has the advantage then.

So to summarize, your move locally is good, however since you loose sente and you give black al ot of influence I think you should play another way.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[dc];B[hc];W[df]C[P: Is too early to play here?

* No you must play here, there is a weak point here and you really defend here.]
;B[pj]
(;W[nc]LB[qc:A][qq:B]C[* Where to play is probably also a matter of taste but I personally do not like this move.
The major reason is that the black group on the left is too strong and is very hard to attack, so white will get a small group and black a lot of influence on the right.
What other options did you investigate ?
Other options are, A, B playing here will not create a weak group, downside is that you do give black more influence. When you have both corners you will have a bout 65 points, and it is hard to estimate how much points black will get.

I think the game has become very difficult for white.];B[oc]
;W[nd];B[qf]

;B[le];W[mb];B[kd];W[me];B[db];W[cb];B[ea];W[id]LB[ld:A]C[P: This is wrong I think

* This is a good move, it separates black. A move at A and white will live so the white group is strong. Now suddenly black has a weak group.]
;B[ic];W[ie];B[jb];W[kb];B[ig];W[jf]LB[ge:A]TR[id][ie]C[* better to play A. This will seal in black and connect the 2 white stones. The black stones will still be weak..]
;B[dl];W[lf]LB[fo:B][go:A]C[* White is already alive. this only adds 8 points to your total, it is too small. Move around A (or B) is better will weaken the black stone drastically.]

(;W[qj]LB[ge:C][ej:A][fj:B]C[P: I usually play here to make sabaki, and usually it ends ok for me, but I think its because black dont play well. I see this area is too big and I dont know well the best way to reduce


* This is too soon. First play A or B  and see how black responds.
A move here splits the 2 black groups as well. 
See the difference when white would have a stone at C.];B[qi]

[ni][jj][kj][mj][oj][pj][nk]C[P: I think Im behind and so I need to do something big. Im trying to kill

* When you think you are behind, you really should count first. Because this will largely determine how to go forward.

However this is a good move, it does separate the 2 black groups and keeps the pressure on black.

The count is:
White: 
left 20 p.
left down: 8 p
top 18 p
Total: 46 p.

Black 
top: 6 p.
bottom left: 8 p.
Bottom right: 32 p
Top Right: 13 p. minimum.
Total 59 p.
