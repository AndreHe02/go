AB[pd][dp]C[dear commentator!

i have added a few comments of mine, and would be glad if you
can give me some hints if i´m right with my ideas.   thanks for
your work and your efforts!

Duumvir

DRS: Hi.

FH: The review from DRS is very well, i only give comments when
i have an other opinion];W[pp];B[dd]C[DRS: The first four moves are 4-4 points.  This means this is
an influence/fighting game, not a territorial game.  If you like
territory, you may want to study 3-4 or 3-3 even.];W[fc];B[cf]
C[DRS: This move is inconsistent with the D16, a 4-4.  D14 is a
consistent, influence-oriented move that puts greater pressure
on F17.];W[nc];B[qf]C[DRS: Same comment here as for move 4, plus the handicap go books
recommend K17 or K16 to separate White's top side into two weak
groups.];W[ch];B[dc]C[i wanted to stabalize my corner, with the option of the future
attack on f17 or c12. is this ok?

DRS: You've stabilized your corner, but it would be better to
run out into the center.
  This is not a large corner, and this is only a two-stone game,
so you shouldn't play moves that are quite this slow-and-steady.

FH: it is really to slow, this stones are not weak k16 is still
good];W[ic];B[cj]C[and now the attack on c12..

DRS: This is good.  Prevent White's base.];W[eh];B[ej]C[DRS: I like this too, although arguably O3, R6 or K4 would be
better.];W[cn]C[FH: very greedy style];B[fq]C[what do you think about this answer?

DRS: This is still too territory-oriented for a 4-4 like D4.
It's good to play low like this if White has a stone around H3
or so, but I think usually with a 4-4, you should play 4-6 after
a kakari at C6.

DRS: Also, in this position, my first reaction is B C5, W D6,
B F4.  This makes White heavy, gives you something to chase,
while at the same time you take a firmer grip on the corner (not
a solid grip, but a firmer grip).];W[bp];B[cq];W[bq]C[DRS: W should probably have played at C8 to make a small base]
;B[en]C[i wanted to put pressure on the white group and getting influence
toward the center. is this ok?

DRS: Seems ok.

FH: i think this is not a good move. with C2 white can live easy.
the black position is over concentrated.  i would play B2 to make a double attack on the two white groups
on the left.
otherwise you can play anything else.];W[dl]C[good move of white, splits my groups

FH: 19 splits nothing black is to strong.
you can play G8 to build thickness, or you can still play B2
for a double attack]
(;B[jq]C[wanted to make some territory, and playin round k6 in the future

DRS: I do not think this move is urgent, and I don't think it's
as big as a kakari at O3 or R6.
B can easily get settled with B2 or K3 later.

FH: its to close to blacks thikness.];W[lq]C[FH: its to close to blacks thikness, too]

(;B[jp]C[DRS: I think this is slow.  If you want to play locally, K5 is
faster, and still pretty safe.

FH: tooo slooow
you should attack white, or play a big point on the right];W[fl]
;B[gj];W[ff];B[eg]C[wanted to fight at this moment. do you think its correct to start
a fight here? (in the end i won this local battle, but i´m not
sure if this was correct)

DRS: I would probably R6 or R8 here. If you push and cut here,
you may end up damaging your E10 group.

FH: looks like bad style];W[fg];B[fh];W[dg];B[ef];W[df];B[ee]

(;W[de]C[FH: 33 is weak];B[ei];W[dh];B[fd];W[fe];B[ed];W[gd]
C[FH: white must take C15, he is in big danger now];B[ce];W[dj]
;B[di];W[bj]C[what can i play against this move?

DRS: C11 is fine.

FH: what about B9?]
(;B[ci];W[bi];B[dk]C[DRS: Two things about this move.

DRS: 1) D10 was a small stone.  It does not connect your weak
group or groups, nor does it separate your opponent's weak group
or groups.  So it is worth very little.    DRS: On the other
hand, B12 is an oiotoshi kill of a decent-sized group, plus it
connects your corner with your center giving you less to worry
about later.

FH: B12 is honte];W[bk];B[gh];W[he];B[qn];W[qq]C[FH: R4 looks common]
;B[pj];W[qh]C[FH: greedy];B[qj];W[oh];B[pc]C[FH: the idea of 54 is to attack the white group, so you should
play O15];W[nf];B[ih]C[FH: blacks groups are very strong so you can invade depth like
M14, M16 or M17.
58 makes it easy for white to build territory.];W[jf];B[cl]
C[FH: 60 is a good move but the next moves are very strange :-)
White must give up the centre stones or the left site. at this
time i would mean that the centre is more important so white
should play on D7];W[ck];B[bg]C[DRS: This erases the beautiful move at B12.  It is a "thank you
move"];W[bh];B[dm]C[FH: now the centre is lost so white must play on B8]
;W[el];B[cm];W[bn];B[bl];W[dn];B[em];W[ak];B[al];W[hi]C[hard to handle; whats the best response here?

DRS: I think either G11 or H12 is fine.

FH: its tricky but not really dangerous
H12 looks best but is your afraid play E9 and this group is alive]
;B[fj]C[wanted to play safe..];W[ek];B[dj];W[hj];B[gl];W[fm]
;B[fn];W[gm];B[gk];W[hm];B[ah]C[FH: very bad! H12 is much better, there is no danger but W H12
is big.
or you can take the B2 and kill white];W[cr];B[dr];W[br]C[FH: still H12, if black tries to save his stones he loses territory]
;B[ho];W[gi];B[fi];W[hh]C[FH big lose];B[ai];W[rh]C[FH: O10 is more important for both]
;B[rf];W[hl];B[on]C[FH: this helps black to defend his weakness on O3]
;W[np];B[cg]C[DRS: Not necessary.   You have three liberties, White had two.
Better to play a more important point elsewhere.  It is generally
best to stay one move ahead of your opponent in a capturing race.
If you're not sure how many moves it will take each side to kill,
count and see how much risk you can tolerate/induce.];W[gn]
;B[fo]C[I like G5 better.  More pressure on H8, and it doesn't make an
empty triangle.];W[rc]C[whats a good answer against this move?

DRS: I like R18.  IMO, this is attack of White's is a bit overambitious.
Usually if a corner has more than 7 spaces in it, it will be
hard to kill.  But as with all things go, that is not always
true.

FH: .... to laugh :-)]
(;B[ob]C[FH: this helps white to stabilise his territory];W[nb]
;B[oc]C[DRS: I don't like this move. It makes an empty triangle, and
it does nothing to put pressure on S17.];W[qb]C[again: how to play against this invasion?

DRS: It's getting harder to kill White inside.  Perhaps S16 or
S19 will work though.

FH: Q13 is still good, but lokal S16 is enough];B[rj]C[FH: not necessary]
;W[rd]C[DRS: S19 still might kill.

FH: its not so easy]
(;B[pg]C[DRS: I don't like this move.  If you must play it, save it for
late endgame.  It makes no points for you, and begs White to
strengthen his or her group.

FH: OK; this protects the cutting point];W[ph];B[og];W[ng];B[nh]
;W[ni];B[mh]C[i think, this was a bad manouvre! but what else to play in this
situation?

DRS: I'd try S19.];W[oj]C[now white has a big moyo at the middle top!]
;B[ne];W[me]C[FH: N16 should work, or ...?]
(;B[nd];W[md];B[of];W[mf];B[hk]C[FH: The black group is not secure now]

(;W[ik];B[il];W[jk];B[im];W[qg];B[oe];W[sd]C[FH: W T18 works better]
;B[sb];W[pa]
(;B[na]C[such a lousy move! :-D

DRS: Yes.  Good if you learn from it.];W[oa];B[mb]C[FH: you lose the cutting point N17]
;W[mc];B[qe];W[ma]C[FH: or pass : )]
(;B[ok]C[maybe its better to play n11?  trying to connect th n12 group
to my other stones?

after the next moves i realizes that it would have been best
to attack th white g6 group, maybe with j6! (is this right?)

DRS: I think you can probably get away with not defending R10,
so yes, something like H6 is probably good.

FH: If you capture the stones G7 ... its good enough to win.
you can take it with L8.
... but first you could test white];W[nk];B[ol];W[in];B[jm]
C[FH: bad style, L8 is better];W[jn];B[km];W[hn]C[DRS: I like L6.  But I'd probably count before playing it.  If
I'm ahead without killing K6, I'd just play G5.  But if I'm behind,
I'd play L6.]
(;B[go]C[is L6 better?

FH: yes; you would win];W[kn];B[lm];W[lo];B[pi]C[DRS: Of what benefit was this?  It begs White to make a stronger
shape, and erases a ko threat.  Sometimes, if you don't push
at White and beg him or her to strengthen his or her shapes,
a fight will spill over from another area and destroy something
that was left weak - something which would become a rock against
which your fighting stones are crushed if you beg White to strengthen.]
;W[oi];B[lk];W[mi]C[FH: better to play M11]

of white, maybe round p3 or something like that?

you think you are way behind and don't mind acting out of desperation.]
