AB[pd][dp]C[Tuomas: Hi, I am Tuomas, 4 kyu from Finland and I will be giving a review for this game. When I review I try to avoid using variations. Instead I try to show you some key moves that you should consider in situation. Finding variations will be left for your job. I will speak straight and bluntly but please don't get annoyed by that. I mean no ill.

Why did white lose? White lost because he resigned. Why did he resign? Most likely because he had lost all his fighting spirit. Why did he lose that? Hard to say, to me it looks like white got too fixed on single idea and lost sight on what is hapening. When things didn't work out like he hoped, he didn't see any path forward.

In game of go you really end up facing your own personality very soon. I think that in future white should pay more attention to himself, make sure he doesn't get fixed in one plan and remain flexible. Have little more patience and leave things open instead of rushing to resolve attacks as soon as he sees them.]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[cn];B[fq];W[bp]LB[dj:1][po:2]C[Tuomas: In handicap games white usually doesn't push into corners. More common could be fast development with '1' or even tenuki to get '2'.]
;B[fd];W[jd];B[cf];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb]LB[lc:2][qc:1][dd:3][po:4]
C[Tuomas: This is usually not played. The idea is to keep corner invasion at '1' open for later. So if black attacks around '2' white can fight freely and jump to corner to live. Usually black would play '1' to respond this because it is very large move for both.

Instead of this white could now move out with stone '3'. That would leave those two attacking black stones separated and facing white corners both in bottom left and upper right. Another alternative is '4' which is huge move for both.]
;B[cd]C[Tuomas: This is the power of 4-4, even after playing three stones that one white stone has some fight in it.]
;W[qo]TR[pd][qf]C[Tuomas: Good one. Perhaps the higher approach would be better but I am not that good on joseki. White should aim to develop towards marked black stones in corner.]
;B[rq]LB[po:1]C[Tuomas: Too passive from black in my opinion. Two point pincer or extension along bottom or touching white with '1'.]
;W[np]LB[op:1]C[Tuomas: Shoulder hit would probably be better as it would not get as badly cut.]
;B[nq];W[mq]LB[mp:1]TR[pd][qf][dp][fq]C[Tuomas: Solid '1' is better most likely. However there is interesting situation forming. Black has symmetrial weak groups and if white can build strength towards either one he should be able to get nice attack.]
;B[op];W[no];B[oo];W[on]C[Tuomas: This shape is weak for both. Black is almost dead and white has three cutting points.]
;B[iq]C[Tuomas: Good move from black to neutralize the white wall before it got too strong. Now white could push that corner a bit or attack upper right group.]
;W[pj]LB[qi:1][qj:2]C[Tuomas: White wall at the bottom left corner is not strong, but because black upper corner is so weak while could consider playing '1' instead to push it. This would prevent black from making the two-point extension.]
;B[qi];W[qj];B[ri]C[Tuomas: This is a bit passive from black. He should push towards center.]
;W[rj]LB[qc:A][dd:D][cj:C][pn:1][cq:B]C[Tuomas: This is fairly small. Black group at top left corner is fairly stable so this is just end game move for few points. There is still major hole at '1' so white should not expect to get much points from this area. There are big places left around A-D.]
;B[qm];W[pn];B[qn];W[po];B[ro]TR[nn][mp]C[Tuomas: Black connects but has very shaky group so white can look forward for next round in this corner. White has two huge cuts in his shape though.]
;W[dj]TR[lc][cl]SQ[pb][nc][jd][cn][bp]C[Tuomas: White has now the marked formation in two locations on the board. However this is not that good shape. The main problem is that there is dangerous invasion in middle of this shape. The side hoshi stone would aim for influense but both are facing strong black corner so they lose ot of their meaning.]
;B[ci]LB[ci:2][dj:1]TR[dp][fq][iq]C[Tuomas: Without marked black stones in that strong position this would be very tempting situation for white. This shows how valuable the J3 was for black.]
;W[cj];B[bi]LB[di:1]C[Tuomas: In my opinion black should push towards the center with '1' to develop his corner. Again. Lot of symmetry in this game.]
;W[ee]LB[cc:1]C[Tuomas: White could start with '1'.];B[dc];W[fe]
;B[ed]LB[ec:1]C[Tuomas: Bad shape from black. Playing '1' would be more solid.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[hc]C[Tuomas: This one is too much.]
;W[ic]C[Tuomas: Now black has broken shape.];B[hb]C[Tuomas: This doesn't really help black much.]
;W[gf]LB[di:1][pi:2]C[Tuomas: Good defense. White has promising start for center fight. Note how much it hurts black that he didn't play towards center with '1' and '2'.]
;B[lq];W[lp]LB[nr:1]C[Tuomas: White could try to start with '1' to see how well that black corner holds against presure. But this variation is nice for building wall towards center.]
;B[mr];W[mp];B[kq]LB[nn:2][lr:1]C[Tuomas: Black should defend with '1', of course. White has terrible cut in his group at the moment at '2'. And both of these groups are starting to get too heavy for sacrifise.]
;W[nr];B[oq];W[lr];B[or];W[ms];B[kr]C[Tuomas: Time to do some LD, is the black corner alive? Could white try to snip of tail? How the situation on board must develop for that corner to be in real danger?]
;W[ib];B[al]LB[cl:1]C[Tuomas: Too early for end game moves like this. Black should also keep open attack around '1' if he gest chance for it later.]
;W[fc]C[Tuomas: This attack is probably smaller than the fight in the bottom left side. White could leave this to wait for later.]
;B[ec];W[fb];B[eb];W[ha];B[fa];W[gb]C[Tuomas: White lost sente here: Was it worth of the 15 points or so that he got?]
;B[cl];W[dl];B[cm];W[bk];B[ak]LB[dm:1]C[Tuomas: Now is time to push out at '1'. Black can connect to bottom if white cuts from the side.]
;W[bl];B[bm];W[aj];B[am];W[bj];B[dm]TR[bi][ci]C[Tuomas: This exchange just made the two black stones weaker.]
;W[eo]LB[dm:2][do:1][dq:3]TR[cn][bp]C[Tuomas: White could try '1'. It forms classical "run for your life" shape with marked white stones. Black '2' takes out most of its power though. White could try to live later with '3'.]
;B[do];W[dn];B[en];W[fn];B[em]C[Tuomas: All white groups are cut from each other in this corner.]
;W[go]LB[dq:1]C[Tuomas: Another LD exercise: can white live with '1'? If not then was the upper left corner worth losing bottom left corner for black?

I think here white saw attack and had to rush for it without thinking whole board. I call it bloodlust and I have that problem myself all the time :).]
;B[bo];W[fm]LB[gl:1]C[Tuomas: White '1' is faster, lighter and as connected. In following sequence white seems obsessed to take liberties from black, perhaps another instance of bloodlust?]
;B[el];W[dk];B[io]LB[dj:1][pj:5][fm:2][on:4][no:3]C[Tuomas: White is getting in trouble, now he has three weak groups to defend. Five if you count '4' and '5'.

As a matter of fact, lets stop here and count the number of groups both player has: White has those five weak ones and two strong ones in top. Black has four groups. This hints that white plays too agressively and doesn't take enough care of his own groups and their connectivity. Attack and defence are not in balance.

Of course, this is to be expected in handicap game.];W[di];B[ch]
LB[gk:1][nn:2]C[Tuomas: Too passive from black. He could play '1' or '2' to make things interesting. Also bad shape.]
;W[dg]LB[cg:1]C[Tuomas: If black now connects with '1' white will have to play one stone more to secure this group, and he loses sente.]
;B[dh]C[Tuomas: This is overplay.];W[eh];B[ei];W[cg];B[bg];W[bh]
;B[ah];W[ai]C[Tuomas: Nice one from white. This helps overall situation a lot.]
;B[df]LB[fh:1][gk:2][nn:3]C[Tuomas: Bad move from black, playing at '1' would give more strength against white groups at bottom. He could also just start the attack with '2' or '3'. I get a feeling that black is angry for losing those stones and plays on impulse.]
;W[bh];B[af];W[ag];B[bf];W[ef]C[Tuomas: Now things are starting to look better. Incredible central influence for white. He can expect to get lot of points from center, unless those weak groups at bottom ruin it.]
;B[ej]C[Tuomas: Fairly useless move from black. This equals skipping a turn.]
;W[cc]C[Tuomas: Nice try but not quite enough. Better to leave this as ko threat.]
;B[cb];W[bc];B[bd]
(;W[ac]LB[bb:1]C[Tuomas: Turn to corner. That should lead to a seki.]
;B[bb];W[ca];B[ab];W[ga];B[ea];W[pi]C[Tuomas: This is very strong move for center which seems to be where this game will be decided. It also helpst the weak groups at bottom.]
;B[gh]LB[nn:1]C[Tuomas: Black is greedy. Cutting at '1' would be nice.]
;W[ih]C[Tuomas: This builds the center nicely.];B[fg]LB[oe:1]
[nn:2]C[Tuomas: Back is slacking. White '1' would be scary move but the cut at '2' is still big burden for white.]
;W[jm]LB[nn:1]C[Tuomas: This helps white shapes a lot. The cut at '1' isn't that scary anymore and now white is slowly forming a huge center. And even helping those weak stones close to black wall.]
;B[eg]C[Tuomas: Here black is in bloodlust.];W[fh];B[ch];W[dh]
;B[gg];W[ci];B[ff];W[ge];B[fi]C[Tuomas: This kind of shapes wont last a thing.]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[gi]LB[fl:1]C[Tuomas: How about just cutting with '1' to see how black reacts. His groups at center would be under heavy attack. Now white gives black a chance to cut his losses.]
;B[fj]
(;W[hi]LB[gi:2][fl:1][dq:3]C[Tuomas: How about the cut at '1' instead of this white stone? Black shape is crumbling. See how it would develop from there if white tries to capture white '2' for example. Also don't forget to check what would happen if white would play somewhere around '3'.]
;B[fl]C[Tuomas: Now black is back in game.];W[hm]C[Tuomas: Good, this keeps white stones in game.]
;B[gm];W[gl]LB[hn:1]TR[go]C[Tuomas: How about '1' instead? Those two white stones are light. Most important is to connect the marked stone out. I was first going to tell it is slow when white played it but it made such a nice addition to the shape and played out nicely in the end that I couldn't do it :).]
;B[hl]LB[il:1][hn:2]C[Tuomas: I would suggest that next white playes '1' and '2'. He should get nice shape and keep the important stones connected.]
;W[gk];B[gj];W[hk];B[il];W[im]LB[ik:1][gm:2]TR[jm]C[Tuomas: Play '1' instead of this and capture '2' if you have to to connect. The marked white stone is not important. This way you build the center and steer the black away from it,]
;B[hj];W[ik]TR[gk][hk][gl]C[Tuomas: With last few moves white has made his marked group heavy. He could have treated it as light so that there would not have been need to defend it. Check how it developed and see how this group develops further from here. And it just started from a single stone that could have been given away!]
;B[jl];W[ck]C[My idea here is shown in the variation. Unfortunately my opponent didn't tenuki.

Tuomas: Rule of thumb: if success of your plan requires tenuki from your opponen, you might want to make a new plan :). With obvious move like this that kind of thinking is an insult against your opponent. Better to leave it as ko-threat.]

(;B[ij]LB[nn:1]C[Tuomas: Now black pushes to white framework.]
;W[jk];B[kl];W[jj]LB[nn:1]C[Tuomas: The cut is getting scarier once again.]
;B[ii];W[hh];B[ji];W[ki]
(;B[jh]LB[kj:1][kk:2][km:3]C[Tuomas: Black should play squeeze with '1' and '2'. Check from variation how the board would look like. And try to find 3 different plans to attack white :).

Pushing into white framework is nice alternative too for black.]
;W[kh];B[jg]TR[gl]C[Tuomas: White has destroyed his framework by forcing black in there. And this whole run started when white didn't give up the marked stone.]
;W[kg];B[hg]LB[qc:6][of:7][kn:1][nn:5][rn:3][qp:4][dq:2]TR[hl]
[il][jl][kl]C[Too early to resign?

Tuomas: Yes, in my opinion. The last sequence hurt white a lot. He lost lot of points when black ran into his framework and rescued that one group. However if we look at the full board we see that white still has some fight left. There are still three corners with unresolved business.

White must kill the marked black stones as efficiently as possible. The black squeeze is scary but perhaps white can ignore it if he plays '1'. 

Bottom left corner is not that open anymore as black group has now one liberty more and can capture four stones. Compare this to earlier situation where black group was a lot weaker. White can try something around '2' but it will be tough fight ahead.

Second corner in bottom right has lot of holes and as white builds the center he might be able to make this corner more vulnerable. White could start with '3' or '4' and it will be surpricingly hard for black to make two eyes. However the cut at '5' can ruin this plan.

and then finally white can play '6' and '7' to squeeze maximum amount of points from last open corner and center.]
