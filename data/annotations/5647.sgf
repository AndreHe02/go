AB[dp][pd][pp]C[Overall this was a correct game.

Apart from an opportunity to kill white, black missed several times the opportunity to play big points, while it cared to save 1 or 2 stones.

On the other hand, White could play most of the big point in the yose and ensure a short win.

It is to be noted that white invasion of White 39 was quite daring (but I would not know how to ensure a win from there).]
PL[W];W[cd];B[jq]MA[ec][ed][fc]C[Though k3 not a mistake in itself, it is common to reduce the corner first]

(;W[qn]C[normal.
On could play C6 or O17 as well (handicap plays)];B[on];W[rp]

(;B[pl]C[The usual joseki is R3 (see variation)];W[qq];B[pq]

(;W[fq]MA[cn]C[I would not have invaded here, but at C6
(see variation). But this is not totally wrong anyway.];B[fo]
SQ[dj]C[This is not going in th correct direction.

I Black had a stone at D10, this would be correct, because it would make the stone work together nicely.
(always aks yourself : where do my stone look at ?)

All the more, Black is pushing white towards its main potential territory]
;W[hp];B[io]MA[jo]C[Correct idea.

However, I notice that Black has a tendency to play keimas (4 in a row).

Let it be reminded that a keima has a weakness and can be cut.

K5 would be wiser here.
(Pro play on the lines ...)];W[ho]
(;B[hn]MA[in]C[This is too agressive maybe.

This creates a weakness at J6. When running into the centre, one does not want to leave weakness.

(see variation)];W[ir];B[jr];W[dr];B[qh]MA[dj]C[A play at D10 is immensely bigger.

remember : Where do the stones look at ?];W[ck]C[Ouch !!!!

Very good point for White];B[cm]TR[pd][pl][qh]MA[jd]C[Okay, this is now very small.

Now the interesting part of the board is K16 ...

(by the way .... where do the Q16, R12, Q8 stones look at ???)]
;W[ch]C[Same comment :

What  was good for your opponent is good for you.

A play at K16 is bigger.

The C9 stone is not in danger yet (too many weaknesses in black formation anyway)]
;B[jd]C[Good, very big];W[gd]C[This is also big and very good]
;B[ii]MA[jf]C[Good idea.

I would play K14 myself.];W[lc];B[le]C[:-)
(I would have guessed that ...)];W[oc];B[od];W[pc];B[qc];W[qb]
;B[rc];W[el]C[Dangerous. P17 is not safe.
Besides, this area is not interesting.]
(;B[em]MA[hl]C[Same comment, this arrea is of little interest.

Try O17 for some fun, or if black stick to her idea, the good move is H8]
;W[gl]C[of course];B[gm]MA[il]C[J8 better.
Black stones are not in trouble.
(the corner is still open)];W[gi]C[correct];B[hl];W[jj]C[Interesting.]
;B[ij];W[jk];B[ik];W[im];B[in];W[il]MA[jm]C[I don't like this.

K8 is better.

The point here is that you are deliberately removing liberties from your group (count the difference with a play at K8)

This is not a good idea when you are trying to struggle for life within your opponent territory.]
;B[hm]MA[jm]C[J7 was muc more efficient, because the White could not play H7 (damezumari)

See it by yourself.];W[kl];B[km]C[Good

(;W[jl]C[NO !

You DON'T want to save these stones.

They are UNIMPORTANT because they don't ensure 
- eye shape
- cutting function
- connecting function


It is NECESSARY to sacrifice them to get eye shape (see variation)]

TR[ig][jh]MA[gf]C[This is premature : you are not sure that you are cutting shapes that could die if connected.

You would need to have a big threat on H9 for that, or K12/J13

A play at G14 is bigger];B[mf];W[kh];B[kg];W[lg];B[gk];W[fl]

Saving 1 stone is not rewarding.

The answer is : no chance at all.
There are too many white stones around.
