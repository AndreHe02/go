C[I have lost a big group at the beginning and then succeeded reducing my opponent's center. So it was a close game.
Thank you for review.

Hello, I'm Julien, 1k KGS. I'm adding comments and variations to your game.

General overview:
- don't try to save all your stones
- attack by looking for opponent's weaknesses: if it can directly be used, use them! Otherwise, put pressure on them in order to force your opponent to defend only (or you will use them)
- do tsumego (and tesuji): you miss 2 life&death problems in the game
- during yose, the biggest points are on the side/corner, not in the center.]

You suggest yourself the answer: not (always) trying to save all your stones...]

Don't try to live where it is not possible. The aji stone is here and it is possibly useful in the future. But don't use it directly except if you already know what you want to do with it.]
