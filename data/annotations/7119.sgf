C[Hi, my name is Chipuro, 11k on KGS. Although I won this game, It's because a mistake white made, otherwise it would have been really close. I'd like to have my mistakes and problems in my play that needs improving. I think I have problems with direction of play and invasions (on both the giving and the recieving end). I made some notes along the way.

Thanks for rewieving my game!


*Hi Chipuro, I'm Muammer from Turkey. I'm around EGF 2k.
I will try to answer your questions as well as possible. I 2ill also show alternative paths if possible anywhere.

My comments will start with " * "];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic]
C[I usually start with the chinese as black, hoping for an early white invasion which I can use for moyo buliding, or simply building up  a large moyo if the opponent does not attack. Is this ok, or I'm missing something here?

*Chinese Opening is my favorite too. It is very good too take an early advantage, beacause the 3 stones on the side really have great coordination, in terms of both influence and area. 

When you are bored you can try sanrensei, Which is getting three hoshi. (c16-k16-q16)]
;W[qf]
(;B[qh]C[I pincered because I was afraid of white taking q10 if I answered differently, was this ok?

*It is ok but little agressive. Making a shimari is a VERY standard move. See variation.

Moreover, if white takes Q10 you can D10 or C6];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[qn]C[In retrospect, this should have ben at c6, right? I didn't expect that playing in the lower center would become this urgent, so I did this to follow up with q9, or in case of a pincer, r3.

*Yes C6 is more common, but due to R12 stone this is not bad.]
;W[np];B[iq];W[gq];B[lq];W[mq]C[I guess my second mistake was not playing r4 or q9 now, but I just had to make sure this 2-space extension has a decent chance of survival ( I had many blunders in the past losing 2 space extension-groups I thought would be safe.

*The two space extension move is never wrong in fuseki. But after N3, maybe you could try M4 instead of N2.

If the white group around the "two space extension stones", white can steal your base. I.e. like L2 or K2. But you can easily jump center with this formation. In conclusion, 2 space extension hardly gives you net profit but steals your oppponents perfect shape & potential profit.]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[ms];W[ns];B[kr];W[ie]C[I think this white move is a mistake, isn't it? I used it to build up both sides

*Left is huge for the time being. But, this capping move is still not small. Maybe he foresawthe huge moyo potential.]
;B[kd];W[gd];B[ec];W[gc];B[kf]C[*Good 
Now W is not very confortable there. He can take D10.];W[og]
C[My mistake that I didn't realize that p13 was aimed at r12. Could I have done something at this point to save both sides?

*No, he will reduce anyways. See variations.
But it is OK. You shouldn't try to save all right?]
(;B[nf]C[*P14 would lead a better shape. See variation.];W[of]
;B[oe];W[pj];B[qj];W[qk];B[pk]C[Ok, the crosscut wasn't such a great idea, but I find that many players don't know about the "pinwheel" follow up, and start to give me ataris. It't didn't work out here....

*Everycrosscut crosscut leads to complicate fights. And it is hardly wrong. The wrong move usually is the follow up moves after the crosscuts. 
You can  cut without thinking but you should consider every following move deeply.]
;W[rj];B[qi];W[ql]
(;B[ok]C[*Maybe atari? See variation.];W[oi];B[rm]C[A messy sequence follows ending with a small living group and some corner probing. In retrospect I think I shouldn't have lived, could white prevent me black living AND escaping?

*Yes living there is too low. L2 stones are low too. But , looking at the board, there not too much profit for white.]
;W[pm];B[qp];W[qq]
(;B[rp]C[*Here S4 is a little heavy since you wont be able to kill. Hane is more exciting :)
See variation];W[rq];B[po];W[oo];B[pq]C[the idea was that even if I don't kill the r3 stones, I might be able to damage the center with the followup.
At least the sequence ended in sente for black and I could ensure life which I don't know how could I have managed otherwise.]

;W[pl];B[mk]C[This semed like a must have, but guess I forgot about the big left side...still should I have left these 2 for dead? the white wall looks frightening enough as it is, I felt my only option was to cut trough with this group

* You already said what i was about to comment. 2 stones are tiny. also escaping may take you in trouble. D10 , C6 are huge.]
;W[dj]
(;B[cn]C[Is c6 ok? I did not want white to have the whole corner, and I saw no other way.
In retrospect, I should have gone straigh c3, since c6 ended up dying....

*E3 is invadable. Therefore, C3 would just solidfy the wall and D10 will work in coordination. Therefore C6 is better than san-san.

Also, C13 or a move around there, which will pressure G16 stones is OK. White will probaby answer. If he is not he will have a moyo at lower left but the 3 stones will be troubled.]

;W[ao];B[br];W[co];B[dh]C[I think this is the biggest point right now. I felt I was slightly ahead, and all I had to take care of somehow is the center white influence

*Yes this is a good move. Big point + pressuring 3 stones. Almost all other moves are early yose. Maybe a kikashi like G5 would be OK too for the time being.]
;W[eh]C[I wasn't sure how to deal with this stone, and I'm not convinced my followup was ok.

*I would make hane. If he cuts the 3 stones would be in trouble.]

(;B[dg];W[eg];B[ef];W[ff];B[ee];W[fe]C[I didn't expect the white center wall to be this huge, and I felt I had to take some risks.

* I do not think W is huge. E11 is a good move. But no need for more aggressive moves. 
Anyway, I would start with G5. See.]
(;B[ei]C[I reasoned thet even this sten gets cut, there are two strong groups I can run to while harassing the e13 group.

*Right, after cut you will an other probe trapping upper W group.]

(;B[ig]C[I did this to ensure connection, but I'm not sure I cannot be cut at this point.]
;W[hg];B[ih];W[mh]C[I also don't understand this one. In retrospect I think w should have cut at j10.

*True. N12 does not br≈üng any thing.];B[jj];W[lp]C[I didn't know what to make of this, the following exchange felt good for black]

(;W[pb]C[White gave away sente for a few point, was this worth it? I usually avoid playing 2line hanes untill the endgame

*Well, first of all the early end game has started so big gotes are playable.
About  Q18, I asked the same question to a dan player recently. I said "isnt R18 better?" (see varation) He said "it depends on number of sente/gote and big points. You have to judge."
I think F18, J2 and H5 are bigger than this point. But it is not a critical mistake.]

*Yes you already had a weakness. N16 would initiate a big ko.]
;B[nf];W[mg];B[ne];W[hr]C[this is purely a reducing move, or does it has some followups?

*Yes it is very standard. Your playing was correct. H18 and F18 are other alrternatives for both sides. But, before one should check if attaching works (J18 and E18 for white), which will result in more reducing. People usually doesnt risk and just defend the rest of their area. See my variation.]
