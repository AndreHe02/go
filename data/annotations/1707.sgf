C[ This game was played in IGS. I was Alguien 18k*. My opponent was a 7k*, lakeland. I asked him to play because sometimes I want my mistakes to become evident the moment I make them.

 I found many of them, but one of the most important is that I find hard to get life to groups that start in a position that seems easy to protect. near the wall with some space, etc...

 Maybe the mistake is thinking these goups are stronger that they really are. So please tell me when should I settle groups and how.

 Thank you very much for reviewing this game.

                                     Alguien.

R: see my comments preceded by R:];B[qp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[oq]
;W[dj];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[qe];B[qg];W[oe];B[nd]
;W[ph]C[R: The normal response here is to defend R13 stone at R12 now.  There is a continuing sequence (joseki) that allows this black group on the right hand side to live easily.  As the group grows down the rhs it works well with the R4 stone.  The two stones at the top are not under any real threat.  See the sequence from b.  when you do this later W doesn't have the weakness around Q14.]

(;B[qd];W[re]
(;B[ne]C[R: O15 strengthens Ws position making it harder to do anything about R13.  Since the top black group is now strong too, O15 could be played elsewhere.  See b, c,  d  and e in the previous frame.]
;W[of];B[qh];W[pi];B[qi];W[pj];B[qk];W[jd]C[ Until now I was quite happy with the result. Was I in a bad position at this moment?

 Now I think about c17 as best move, but at the moment I was very nervous and didn't even think about it.]
;B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[df]
(;B[jc]C[ J17 would have probably been better.

R: I think K17 is an overplay too.  W gets to establish an easy position while B has to struggle.B at J17 means B has a relatively easy position and W has to struggle.]
;W[ic];B[id];W[hc]
(;B[kd];W[je];B[hd];W[kc];B[lc];W[jb];B[gg]C[Here I was just trying to run. Was there a better way to save the group?

R: Escaping is ok, now that you are here, but keep it up.];W[ig]

(;B[eb];W[db];B[ed];W[dc];B[ef]C[ I don't really understand why i did this. I was just trying to get more space.

R: the sequence just removes aji and strengthens W.  aji = uncertainty, useful to exploit later for ko threats and eng game moves.]
;W[eg]
(;B[fg]C[ Maybe f14 was much better.

R: it's already working in Ws favor.   Run.  (F14 protects against W at G15)]
;W[ee]C[b is better because you stay connected. You will still have to run.]

(;B[ff];W[ge];B[if];W[jf]C[R: b is urgent ie only choice.]
(;B[hf]C[ Here I thought connecting at f15. But the fight for life was too hard for me to read.]
;W[fe];B[gd];W[eh];B[gi]C[R: See you could have done this (59) earlier.]
;W[ld];B[ke]C[R: 61 is throwing good stones after bad.  Sometimes you will see players sacrifice a 2nd stone but not under these circumstances.  You have to be able to use the sacrifice to get some squeeze plays in to surround a group, for example.  But that may be too hard for you to use at this stage in your learning.]
;W[le]C[R: b would be a better way to approach making the cut.  But the cut doesn't work because W can capture it in a net.  (Ladder works for B )]

(;B[og]C[R: Does this work?];W[pg]C[ No way to cut the ladder, so...

R: now no way to cut (period).];B[ol]C[Can you enclose the W group at Q13?  That's the real reason for 65.  I could be hard.  W will probably connect to K14 group (via b)]

(;W[od];B[oc];W[rc];B[rd]C[ And now once again the same problem. How to give life to this kind of groups? I find really hard saving groups and I don't know even a basic theory of what kind of moves are usefull to get life against a small portion of wall.

R: This difficulty arises because you have let W force B into making 2 weak groups.  However the W group at Q13 is also weak.  B should attack it by attempting to surround it thus forcing W to make 2 eyes. Careful attack can strengthen B either by helping to form 2 eyes or helping to escape to the middle.    Don't follow W around - look for alternative moves that work for you in another way.]
;W[sd]C[R: b aims at building eye space, c at escaping while threatening W.    You have to do one or the other.  If getting surrounded only allows you to make one eye then you must escape or abandon them.

I'd prefer to escape.  Getting surrounded gives up just too much if it can be avoided.

So may be the problem is recognizing how much space you have to make 2 eyes.

Tactics to get more eye space are to make the group bigger by pushing from the inside (e.g. b and d).  You have to look for the dead spaces, fat five,  t-4 etc to ensure you will get more than one eye.  This takes studying of life and death problems.]

(;B[qb]C[ Here, lakeland, my opponent, told me s18 could have been better.

R: See previous.  It is still a fight to make 2 eyes and could easily go wrong for you.]

;W[lk]
(;B[nh]C[ O10 better?

R: may be.  You might get a chance to surround W and turn the tables.  W doesn't have 2 eyes yet.]
;W[nj]C[R: b may have possibilities.  c is probably easiest way to make another eye]

(;B[kg]C[ From here I guessed moves until the saving of the group. However I don't know if it could have go worse. I'll make a comment in the final move of this string.]
;W[mg];B[lg];W[mi];B[ji];W[ii];B[jg];W[ih];B[ij];W[hj];B[ik]
;W[hi];B[li];W[kk];B[ni]C[ Here, the group is saved. Should I be proud of it or there was a big mistake somewere. Another problem is that now my other group is even weaker.

R: this is the result of having the 2 weak B groups mentioned earlier.

W is going to walk all over you because of the big difference in strength.  It is hard to sharpen your skills if your opponent is so strong you don't have time to exercise.

To help you read these out you have to visualize the moves and then count the resulting no of liberties.]
;W[ok]C[R: b keeps connected and a better chance to escape.]

(;B[fk]C[ Trying to enclose and kill j11. Was there a better way? i chose this one mostly because it semed to extend a little g16 group's life.

R: 111 can be cut.
Looks like B group's fate is sealed by now.];W[gj];B[fj];W[gh]
;B[fh];W[fi];B[ei];W[gi]C[However now it's cut. I must kill j11 or die.]

(;B[dh];W[dg];B[ej];W[il];B[hk];W[gk];B[hl];W[gl];B[hm];W[di]
;B[fl];W[fm];B[dk];W[el];B[ek];W[ck];B[dl];W[dm]C[R: b is better but doesn't help.]

(;B[em];W[cl]C[ And here I resigned. Was there a way to kill?

 Anyway, thank you very much for reviewing the game.

R: There is a point where you should realize your stones are a lost cause.  Instead of trying to save them directly you can threaten to save them.  Such moves can be made to extend your other groups such as the F3 group.  You still have the potential for good territory in the bottom right.

You've heard it before.  Practice life and death problems.  It helps you know when to stop to make life and when to run.

Good Luck.  Hope this helps.
