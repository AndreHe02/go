C[I would be hesitant to play c17.     I'd feel that taking a corner, and
   threatening a 2dimensional moyo
   with r5 might be better.

Also, w will undoubtedly respond
   with c16, which will result in
   some impressive thickness with
   a ready made extention.];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B
[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[cn]L[dj]C[Since you did come out with sente,
   c17 seems better :)

c6 is a nice agressive move.

Understand that w's response was
VERY passive, and allowed you to live far too easily (IMO).

Variation 1 might be one way
w could have made life more  difficult. Certainly c5, which uses d10 more, would be a more aggressive  counter than d6, where you just live easily.]

(;W[dn];B[co];W[do]C[you do a fine job of taking advantage of his error]
;B[bq];W[cp];B[bp];W[cm];B[bm];W[bl];B[cl]C[d8 by him is just abysmal after the good  double hane]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[ck];B[cm];W[bk];B[el];W[dk];B[en];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo]C[I feel g5 would be superior to f6 here, see  variation 1]

(;B[fn];W[go];B[hp];W[gn];B[gm];W[mp]L[qo][po][ko]C[To me, w is playing a  very dangerous game here. H7 comes very close to killing the d4 string, which  is huge for b.

I'm not wild about n3.  r5 or q5 seem more solid. Maybe l5, if you want to be  more sure about keeping w split.]
;B[mq]C[The general rule is: Don't  use contact plays against weak stones.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[lq];B[lr];W[lp];B[im]C[I would prefer h7  to j7. More
solid.];W[pp];B[qp];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[pn];W[rn];B[on];W[qq];B[rq]L[qr]
C[Can't understand why w doesn't
r2. This cut does work.  B's cut at q6 was an overplay.];W[op];B[qr];W[kr]
;B[mr];W[kq];B[jo];W[ho];B[io];W[iq];B[ip];W[jr];B[er];W[dr];B[gq];W[eq]
L[fr]C[seems clear  to me that f2 is better than e5. If w e5, it is a
gote eye, and you kill his other
eye with c2. Further, w can do no
better than make a gote eye around b1, so if he does you can e5 then.

What I say above is not quite right:
 If b responds to e5 with b2, then
 w can get a ko for life. See variation 1.]
(;B[eo];W[fr];B[gr];W[es];B[ep];W[br];B[ld]L[on][pn]C[I might have considered n7, rather
than 89. 89 is big, but n7 is a
strong attack on the m4 string. Also, by strengthening the two
b stones, it almost kills the s6
2 stones.];W[qc];B[qd]C[91 seems right direction to me.];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]
;B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb];B[jf]L[kf][kg][ke]C[I might  play 99 at l14 or maybe
l13. 99 seems to leave weakness at l12.];W[qg];B[og]C[Capping play seems right here.]
;W[rk];B[rj]L[qj]C[These are good responses to the
attack. however, realize that
stronger players will not be
quite as passive as w is here.

The crosscut at a might be a  stronger response to your hane here.

As it is played, you do very well.];W[rl];B[qj]C[105 very  solid.];W[ql]
;B[pl];W[ro];B[rp];W[qm];B[sm]C[The vital point. They are teaching
good life and death at 24k :).];W[pm]L[ol][nl]C[seems an easy  win could be had
right here just by p8, and
then next extending to o8. I think
b is ahead in this game, and doesn't need to kill w. As it turns out, w had a  couple of chances to come back as a result of this line.]
;B[om];W[ol];B[pk];W[nl];B[mn]C[The 3 stones  are actually dead here, given proper w play (I think) :)]
;W[nn];B[nm]C[118 is a killer tesuji. See variation
1 for how w should have played.]
(;W[no];B[ml];W[nk];B[mk];W[nj];B[ph]C[125 a nice move];W[qh];B[pi];W[mj]
L[mj][nj][nk]C[w in bad trouble here  seems either  o10 group dies, or bottom group dies.]
;B[lj];W[lm];B[mm];W[li];B[kj];W[mh];B[nh]L[jh]C[Not wild about 135. seems to give
w too much chance to escape.
perhaps k12 would be better. Not sure what the intent behind 135 was. All it  seems to do is steal w's eye.]

connection here   rich 24k : well, I usually don't have time trouble, so it's OK]
;B[re]C[139 really a nice move, after w makes an ineffectual move on
138.];W[rc];B[qf];W[pg];B[pf]C[w dead];W[lk];B[ll];W[kk];B[kl];W[jk];B[ji]

C[165 another nice move. you
won't be 24k for long with moves
like that..

w 164 should be j11

it would have connected w's
marked group, and affected the
game not at all];W[hf];B[hi];W[gi];B[hh];W[gh];B[hg];W[gg];B[ie];W[id];B

good for b now];W[gb];B[hd];W[gd];B[ic];W[hc];B[jc];W[if]C[

C[This move not really  necessary....

a is a fairly large move, and sente];W[jp]C[even this is not sente.  w needs
another move to make an eye,
and can't connect if b doesn't let him.];B[lb]C[good job to ignore  it]
;W[kp]L[hr]C[now b must do h2, and kill w..

However, to the outcome
of the game, it matters not
a bit.];B[ib];W[hr];B[hs];W[gs];B[fs];W[fm];B[em];W[gs];B[bf];W[is]C[really, w could not afford to
ignore this ko threat. He needs
to fight this out till all of b's
big threats are gone.];B[ae];W[ce];B[bg];W[bh];B[ah]L[cg]C[221 is not so good, should be c13]

w was a little sharper, the corner might have died.]

enough though. So b should win
