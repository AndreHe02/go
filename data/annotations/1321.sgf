C[Computer playing at level 5

In this game I have lost very hard, but I don't know exactly why and where.

I am playing white.];B[cc];W[cg]C[better around f4 to guarantee room for expansion]
;B[fc];W[gd];B[gc]C[black is happy with this exchange that makes top solid territory,
while white's position is wide open];W[gg]C[if u imagine all 3,3 points played first, then the exchange
g6-f7 is better for black. white now still has a weakness at e3]
;B[hd]C[a bit slow. e3 would have been severe];W[ge]C[a bit slow again]
;B[ce]C[very big point];W[df]C[defends but leaves big points b4 (or even b3) for black]
;B[de]C[slow; not much points to be made in center. better h5]
;W[ed]C[looks like overplay. black can answer e5]
(;B[ec]
(;W[dd]C[wrong or false?
perhaps E5 is better, but can I win the game?

e5 is proper move but black has lead];B[ee];W[fd];B[dc];W[cd]
;B[bd];W[bf];B[be];W[ef];B[he];W[hf];B[cf];W[bg];B[ff]
(;W[gf]C[false move?

should block at f3 instead];B[fg];W[fe]C[I don't want to let him into my territory and so cut him off

?????????????????? must protect d3 !];B[eh]C[computer could capture with d3 but maybe tries to kill g3 group]
;W[dh]C[this is false because of black D3

black can still capture at d3];B[gh];W[hh];B[if];W[hg];B[ih]
C[weird, h1 would kill white trivially];W[gi];B[dg]C[now I lose all stones]
;W[eg];B[dg];W[fh];B[ch];W[ei];B[di];W[bh]C[white needs j3 to live
now all dead after black j3];B[bi];W[tt];B[hc];W[tt];B[ig];W[tt]
;B[fi];W[tt];B[gh];W[tt];B[hi])
(;W[fg]C[w leads]))
(;W[ee];B[he];W[hf];B[bg];W[bh];B[bf]))
(;B[ee];W[fd];B[ff];W[he];B[fg];W[ec];B[eb];W[db];B[fb];W[dc]
;B[hc]C[black wins]))
