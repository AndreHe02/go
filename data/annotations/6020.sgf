C[Hi! I played black in this game and felt that I fell behind, despite white playing one very unreasonable-looking move at the start. I'd appreciate any comments on any part of the game

Thanks!

forfun (ff):  This was an interesting game.  Black showed some interesting ideas but fell down particularly by not anticipating White's counterplay.  We all make this kind of mistake as we follow our own "good" ideas with too much enthusiasm.  Unfortunately in Go, our opponents get to play as many stones as we do.  It seems quite unfair at times to let these people spoil our best creations, but that is what the rules allow! :-)

Both Black and White seemed to play without stopping to consider what where the important directions and issues on the board.  I tried to point out some alternatives along the way.  As usual my mouse clicks faster than my fingers type so there are a lot of variations offered, sometimes with little or no comment.  Enjoy them, but always remember not to trust them.  Explore them and try to defeat them, I am sure you can succeed on some of them.]
;B[pd]C[ods [2d\]: hiya];W[dc];B[pq];W[pn]C[ff - I guess that White plays here to avoid giving Black the choice of a Chinese fuseki or a Kobayashi fuseki.  However, this means that Black has the option of ignoring this play in order to take control of the last open corner.  See the variation...]

(;B[qp]C[ff - This is a rare and passive reply to White's approach.  It prevents White from attaching at R3 but achieves little else.  It does not threaten the high White approach stone.  Perhaps Black confused the situation with the normal reply to the low approach at R6.]
;W[dp];B[de];W[dh];B[gd];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[dd];W[fc];B[cc]
;W[ec];B[ff];W[ge];B[bd];W[nc]C[ff - Pros more often hold back around L17 with this play.]

(;B[nd]C[ff - Black might consider holding back here (see the variation).  White has a difficult time eliminating the aji of the Black stone at G16 without any assistance from Black.  If Black likes a fight, an immediate pincer is also possible to help put the G16 stone in motion immediately.]
;W[md];B[ne]
(;W[qc];B[oc];W[qd]
(;B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[re];B[qg];W[jc]C[ff - If White has to play here to "finish" the top, then O17 and N16 are almost "thank you" plays.  In any case the aji here remains poor for White.  Black can easily play J16 or attach on top at K16.  White will not make much of the top now.]
;B[pl];W[kq];B[mq];W[qj]C[I was quite happy with my position up to this point. I was surprised to see this move - it looks totally unreasonable, and I got a fairly good result, but I felt I could have done better.

ff - This is unreasonable.  On the other hand, Black does *not* get a good result here :-)  White successfully takes advantage of some overplays by Black.]

(;B[ok]C[ff - This looks natural, but considering the result, the even more solid play at R8 might have been better (see the variation).]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[oi]
(;B[ni]C[ff - This seems like an overplay.];W[ql]
(;B[qm]C[ff - This is not reasonable here.  White's resulting shape is too good.  Black has to consider White's next play.  During the game, Black may have missed it, but being able (and willing) to assess your opponent's opportunities is fundamental to improving your own game.]
;W[pk]C[Black is helpless here...]
(;B[pm]C[ff - Black selects a connection that leaves too many interesting choices for White (see the variation)...]
;W[rl];B[pb];W[qb]
(;B[oh]C[ff - Overprotective of the top?  Black still has N17.]

(;W[ph]C[ff - This looks lik a bad idea for White.  Black's upper right group lives absolutely.]
;B[pi];W[pj];B[qi]
(;W[rj]C[ff - This ought to be a bad play by White.  See the variation...]
;B[ri];W[rm]
(;B[rn]C[ff - This is the same issue as the play at R7.  Black makes an unreasonable play, ignoring White's obvious counterplay.  As a result, White breaks completely through the Black wall.  See the variation...]
;W[qn];B[ro];W[ol];B[om];W[nk]
(;B[nm];W[mk]C[ff - White slices the Black position in half.  Although White has only one eye on the right, the overall game situation looks pretty tough for Black.  The one good point is that Black has no weak groups.]
;B[lj]
(;W[nh]C[ff - Adding this stone looks like it helps Black more than it hurts.  See the variation.]
;B[og];W[mj];B[mi];W[li];B[mh];W[lh];B[mg]
(;W[lg]C[ff - An overplay by White?  Black's stone's are alive on the right, so there is little to gain here.  See the variation...]
;B[kj];W[mf];B[ng];W[ll]
(;B[lf]C[ff - Black turns away from the main fight in the center.  The key question here is whether the two Black stones can escape and erase the center by threatening the one-eyed White group.  See the variation...]
;W[kf];B[le]
(;W[me]C[ff - A very painful mistake for White.  See the variation.]
;B[ke]
(;W[ji];B[lc];W[mn]C[I suppose I should have played M6 at some point earlier

ff - Playing M6 would be part of a strategy that gives up the cutting stones at M10.  This would be the wrong approach.  Once Black cut at M14, there was no appropriate time to return to M6.]

(;B[no]C[ff - This play looks natural, but it leaves more aji for White to utilize.  See the variation...]
;W[mo];B[np]C[ff - This is painful and a White play at N7 is sente.]
;W[cn]
(;B[dr]C[ff - At this point Black needs to assess whether being sealed into the corner while White takes the center will be enough to win.  This play allows White to decide whether to defend the corner or the outside.  The outside looks much larger here.]
;W[fr]C[ff - White judges the outside to be larger than the corner...]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[br]
(;W[ap]C[ff- This play is aggressive but it gives Black the chance to move back outside.  Probably White should have continued to seal Black in...]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[er];W[bq];B[fq];W[cr];B[iq]C[If I had to pick a losing move, I think this would be it. Black gets sealed in and the corner turns into a spectacular failure. How else could I have played?

ff - I think that White gave Black a second chance here.  It would have been better to simply seal Black into the corner.]
;W[go]
(;B[kr]C[ff - This is not a small play but it is a very passive response to White's threat.  See the variation...]
;W[gq];B[gr];W[hr];B[fs];W[hq];B[fo];W[fn];B[ds];W[ch]C[This is an excellent move that I hadn't expected (I don't play that joseki very often) and now white is clearly ahead.

ff - Once White has become very thick in the lower left corner and even added F6 there is little chance for Black to invade behind the stone on D12.  So C12 is smaller than it would have been earlier.  Probably the upper side is bigger for White.  However, before Black can threaten the upper side, the cut at D14 must be protected.  Otherwise the two Black stones at E14 do not threaten anything, they just sit waiting to be captured by White.  See the variation...]

(;B[id]C[ff - Again Black plays without sufficient consideration of White's resources...]
;W[gf]C[ff - Puts Black on the spot.]
(;B[dg];W[fg]C[ff - Now it looks like the game is over.  Comments end here.]
