C[This is my first time submitting so I hope I've got it all right!  I've marked a couple questions, but more than anything, I'd like comments about the things I don't understand well enough to know to ask questions about.  Please don't hesitate to be as critical as you can - I won't take offense =)

Ohh!  and let me know if there's anything I should do differently next time I submit a game.

Thank you in advance!

Julian

Forfun (hereafter "ff") - Thanks for submitting a very interesting game.  Both players played interesting games.  I thought Black got off to a good start.  This was helped by White playing too tightly with defensive moves at the edge.  Some of the time Black took advantage of this and other times Black cooperated with White to play a few small moves in less important areas.  Both this playing pattern and some of the comments submitted show that Black could benefit from more frequently assessing the overall situation of the game.  It is important to keep in mind what are the important areas - mainly those that are unsettled and contain weak stones.  At the top and later at the bottom Black played from strong stones when there were weak Black stones in the area.  This gives the opponent to play away from the strong stones and toward the weak.  This is the opposite of what we would like to have happen.  It is important to play from your weak stones in order to strengthen them naturally.  I know, I have lost endless games by doing the same as Black here :-)

This file is full of variations, some with good points and doubtlessly others that are nonsense.  The task of sorting the wheat from the chaff is left as an exercise for the reader.  Good luck, trust nothing that I have written until you have checked it for yourself!]
;B[qo];W[dd];B[pd];W[ep]
(;B[fc]C[ff - This is a little unusual.  The top features two star point stones.  The situation there is symmetrical and stable.  The bottom features two unsymmetrical corners and is unstable.  It would be more typical for Black to continue with a play along the bottom, either enclosing the bottom right or entering the bottom left.]
;W[jc]
(;B[cf]C[ff - White's pincer at K17 is very rare in professional play when there is a Black stone on the star point in the upper right.  I think it is because the relationship is not quite right if Black plays in at C17.  See the variation.  As a result, I think that Black's choice of C14 here was not that good, better would have been C17.]
;W[ee]C[ff - This play does not solve White's problems with K17.  It probably would have been better to attach at F16 or even D14.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[cb];B[bb];W[db]
(;B[ci]C[I wasn't very happy with the result in this corner: my position feels too small and low.  Is this a reasonable result, or if not, what should I have done?

ff - Up to the previous move White and Black have played out an old corner variation dating back to at least 17th century China.  Typically Black would now play elsewhere here.  With the pincer in place at K17, Black might want to play J16.  The White wall has no eyes and has to worry about the outcome when Black puts the original approach stone in motion.

The play at C11 is not good.  It has no real purpose.  Naturally White turns elsewhere.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pf]C[ff - This play aims at invading at M17.  In this position, however, I think the greater potential for Black is the shoulder hit at J16 to make trouble for White's wall.  Therefore I think Black should have answered here with R14.  See the variation...]
;W[qh]C[My response to this move gave me a weak and cramped shape - but I really don't know how I should have responded.  Was the pincer ok?  or should I have started somewhere else entirely?  Anything you can tell me about the sequence from here up to mvoe 30 would be most welcome!

ff - See the notes to the previous play.  Objectively there is nothing wrong with fighting against this stone.  However, White has defects in the upper side position that may get naturally repaired as both sides jump out along the top.  This may make the result seem unsatisfactory to Black but this is not necessarily the case.  Let's look at what happens here...]

(;B[qj]C[ff - This seems the natural approach.  See the variation...]
;W[oh]
(;B[ne]C[ff - This play is bad shape.  It is dead in the middle of various alternatives.  It has too little impact on any of the White stones.  See all the variations.  I have added without comment some lines seen in pro games.]
;W[pb]
(;B[qc]C[ff - There is no way that Black should have answered in the corner here.  The action is on the right side.  Black should have punished White by ignoring the mistimed play at Q18.]

(;W[qb]C[ff - White continues to play in the wrong place.  See the variation...]

(;B[oj]C[ff - This is a very aggressive idea.  The normal approach is to play from weak stones (in this case the upper stones that are almost surrounded).  N12 is a more reasonable approach here.]
;W[mh];B[le]
(;W[lc]C[ff - White lets Black get ahead here.  See the variation...]
;B[je];W[rf];B[id]C[ff - Black correctly ignores S14.  If White wants to connect along the second line, Black should have no objection.]
;W[ic];B[hd];W[eh]C[ff - This is an extremely dangerous idea by White since the 2-space jump can be cut.]

(;B[dk]C[ff - Black extends the left-side position.  This threatens to give the initiative back to White in the center.]

(;W[gb]C[ff - White answers passively.];B[kh]C[I'm never sure about moves like this - any comment would be welcome!

ff - This is an excellent play.  Black is instantly strong while White is correspondingly weak.

Meanwhile assess the result at the top.  White has run along the top in a very low position.  White still has not secured even 20 points of territory.  Black's territory on the left is close to 15 points.  Black's position on the right side is already a few points of territory and Black's stones have far mor potential to make additional territory than White's.  Go back to Black's comment on R12.  Should Black be dissatisfied with this result?  The answer is clearly no!  Black should be happy.]
;W[nj]
(;B[nk]C[ff - Quite a natural reply.  Black starts to build a large area on the right side.  But what if Black tries to exploit White's weakness more directly?..]
;W[mj]
(;B[nl]C[ff - This is a very strange move.  It is dead gote.  Black has retreated from the fight.  The previous play strengthened the White stones facing the Black center and now Black plays a defensive move aimed at the Black territory on the right side.]
;W[qe]C[ff - This is a slack play.  White "takes advantage" of Black's previous gote move by connecting along the bottom.  Black should say thanks and get on with the game.]
;B[pe];W[rc]
(;B[md]C[ff - It is not clear why Black makes this play.  We never find out since White demonstrates that it is a mistake in any case.  Black should have made the usual reply in the corner.  White's connection is fundamentally not a good idea here.  See the variation...]
;W[kd];B[ke];W[oi]
(;B[pi]C[ff - Bad shape.  It earns Black sente but fixes up the bad aji that White has in the upper right corner.  Black should just answer at Q10.  White has not yet gained anything in the upper right.  Black is ahead right now.]
;W[ph];B[pq]C[ff - This is a very large play and Black is ahead right now.  However, it shows that Black is not really aware of the potential here.  Black should be most interested in the sequence at S16, the cutting play and F18, and the alternative cut at E14.  Because of all these the center is full of interesting, unresolved potential.]
;W[cp];B[jp]C[I'm unsure about this move - looking at the board after the fact maybe I should have played at G3?  I'm really not sure at all.

ff - Realistically this should be enough to win easily for Black.  If Black plays G3, White absolutely must play a pincer and try to complicate the game.  This play or K3 are better here.  I agree with Black on K4.]
;W[mf]C[ff - A seeming forcing play that attacks the connection to the 5 black stones in the upper right.  Actually this is a blunder by White.  Black should calmly ignore it.  See the variation...]

(;B[lf]C[ff - Tactically incorrect.  If Black wants to answer from this side (presumably to protect against a White attempt to cut in the cener), M13 would be better.]
;W[lg];B[nd]
(;W[oc]C[ff - White blunders in return, protecting maybe 10 points of territory at the top but letting Black repair the hole in the center group.]
;B[kg];W[lp]C[This invasion gave me a lot of trouble.  was the positioning of the K4 stone bad?  or is there something else I could have done?

ff - This kind of invasion is all about fighting power plus situational awareness - what is a satisfactory result?  This requires that you have an idea of the score.  If this stone lives and you are behind, then you have to go all out for a kill.  However, that is difficult.  If the stone lives but you still win, then your job is easy :-)]

(;B[ln]C[ff - This offers White an exit at L5.  It is fundamentally a bad shape.  The Black stone on K4 is not strong enough to stand on its own and the White stone at N10 limits what Black could expect to make in the center.]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[ko]C[ff - Now Black is embarrassed to have played M6...]
;B[gq];W[fr];B[in];W[kn];B[lm];W[km]
(;B[kl]C[ff - Black has to consider very carefully what is reasonable in this fight.  The Black stones that extend up here add little to Black's right side position and do not really connect to the Black top.  Meanwhile White's stones grow in strength and threaten the bottom Black group.  I think that Black should play from the weaker side, which is the bottom here.]
;W[im];B[hn];W[jl];B[kk];W[oq];B[po];W[op];B[pr];W[gr]
(;B[hq];W[hr];B[iq];W[lr];B[ir];W[or]C[ff - Once again White turns away from the center of the action.]

(;B[jn]C[ff - Black begins a series of forcing plays - that finally force White to surround the Black stones and nearly kill them!  Black should take the opportunity offered by White P2 to play elsewhere.  Since White has invaded Black's area and already escaped, Black should be happy if White comes back to make two eyes in the space around N3.  It is a small space whoever gets it!

By the way, this play is bad style.  It does not help Black's eye space and it does not hurt White's eye space (K7 is already a false eye).  It also loses the potential to force the two White stones at J7 and K8 into a shortage of liberties.  It is much better left unplayed.]

(;W[cm];B[cn];W[ek];B[bm];W[bl]
(;B[bo]C[ff - This is incorrect shape here.  Black should connect solidly...]
;W[bp];B[fp];W[go]C[I think both players made some mistakes in here - I suspect I got lucky to live, and probably my mistake was to get into this situation in the first place - was there a good chance to avoid being surrounded?

;W[fb];B[hm];W[hl];B[ff];W[dg];B[cg];W[kj];B[jk];W[lk];B[ll]
;W[ji];B[ik];W[il]C[ff - At this point White can be cut at F8.  The bottom right White stones have only one eye if Black plays K2.  The left side White stones would only have one eye (by capturing B9 in gote) if Black played E10.  Finally, Black can cut White at E13 as well.  Black should have this in mind as the center is settled.  However, I no longer see how Black can exploit this easily.  My comments end here.]

(;B[og];W[qk];B[lc]C[ff - The natural alternative would be to play the diagonal move at P13 and invade the top immediately (or possibly invade directly at M17).  However, it seems a pity to allow White to extend on the right side, blunting the natural direction of the R5 stone...]
;W[je];B[le];W[qc]C[ff - Along the top it may well be enough for White to fix up the upper left and then dodge into the corner.]

(;B[qf]C[ff - I think this would have been a calmer approach.  It leaves White no follow up in the upper right.  Meanwhile White's position at the top still has defects at J16 and M17.  If White adds a move at the top, Black has the initiative on the bottom side.]

(;B[id]C[ff - This would have created problems for White.  The wall on the left has no eyes.  Meanwhile White can not gain much by pushing up at K16 because the upper right corner is Black.]

(;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]C[ff - At this point, White's pincer is too far away from White's wall and White needs to add a stone at F16 to prevent Black from putting the lone stone in motion.  However, that leaves White's entire position too narrow.  Effectively White has extended only 3 (maybe 4) spaces from a four-stone wall.  White is dissatisfied.  In addition, White does not have a good approach play against the upper right corner.]

(;B[pq]C[ff - In this game I think that enclosing the corner is interesting.  After this White does not have a very easy choice about how to continue...]

(;W[cp]C[ff- The natural shimari is open on the bottom...];B[cj]
C[ff - Black can split the side and wait to see how the bottom develops.  This seems most natural here.]
