C[Hello,

I usually have a good result with black by creating moyo and attacking invading stones. However, my white result is below average. I always feel that I am behind in the middle game as white (as oppose to playing black).

In this game, I played white and the game is probably pretty close until my mistake around move 128 onward. Please give me advices on how to improve my positions to give me the lead in the middle game.

Thank you,
Vinyoo

;B[fq];W[dn];B[jp]LB[qn:A]C[R6 better.];W[nc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne]
LB[pc:A]C[Personally, I prefer Q17 (to gain more territory). 

Without a black stone (extension) at Q10, O16 is a bad move.]
;W[oc];B[pc]LB[lc:A]C[You can consider M17, this is a very solid move.]
;W[jc]LB[qj:A][qk:B]C[Black should consider A or B.];B[pg]LB[qi:A]
[rg:B]C[I think Q14 is standard. So, this is a thin extension, but I don't know how to take the advantage.

This is another bad move. 

There would be aji (some usage) at A or B for white.];W[po]
LB[ql:A][qn:B]C[Should it be R6 better?

Yes, or play somewhere around R8.

Playing B is another option.];B[pm];W[qq];B[pp];W[qp];B[oo]
;W[qo];B[on];W[rm]LB[pr:A]C[Q2 is more crucial for black.

With white S7 there and Q13 being at fourth line, the right side become less valuable (as in less likely to become black's territory).]
;B[ql];W[rl];B[rk]LB[qk:A][qj:B][rj:C]C[I feel that S9 is an overplay, but not sure how to punish it.

Yes, black R10 is honte.

White has the option to play A, B or C later, you can leave as it is right now.

Just take S8/S9 exchange as kikashi (gain in sente).];W[ce]
LB[fo:A]C[Maybe at C10 better?

No, invasion at H3/J4 or O3 is another strategy.

C15 is good move too.

Black A better, moyo more important.];B[cl];W[em];B[dr]LB[ci:A]
C[Bad move, nothing is more urgent than C11, forming a base.]
(;W[cj]C[Should it be at D9?

C10 is good move.];B[el];W[fl];B[ek];W[fm];B[fk];W[gk]LB[gj:A]
[di:B]C[Black should hane at A without second thought, since B is sente, no need to worry about the cut.]
;B[ei]LB[ch:A]C[This is helping move, white should play C12.]
(;W[hl]C[Too weak, need not to worry about this cut...

Fight if black dare to cut here...];B[ch]LB[hq:A]C[I think this sequence was my greatest mistake in the game. Now black settles easily.

Yes, now you are like giving 2 handicapping stones...

White A better, since you have great influence in the southwest area.]
;W[nq];B[op];W[hq];B[hp];W[iq];B[jq]LB[ip:A]C[I think white J4 better.]
(;W[gp];B[gq];W[ip];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[fp];B[cq];W[jo];B[lp]
LB[ko:A]C[White A still sente.]
(;W[im];B[ko];W[jm]TR[gp][im]C[I am not sure if I gain or lost from this invading sequence since I allowed C3. Please suggest alternatives.

You made 2 bad moves in this sequence.

G4 should be at J4 and J7 should further reduce at L5.

Capturing 3 black stones simply get u some points but you lose points at the lower left corner, so it is even out. 

Now that black is sente, so this invasion is a failure...];B[lm]
LB[mc:A]C[Slow move by black, to probe at A better.];W[nj]LB[me:A]
C[Maybe simply S10 better?

White can consider N15.

With S10 later, this black area isn't that big at all...];B[lj]
;W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[ri];W[pj];B[pi];W[oi];B[ph]LB[mh:A]C[A better.]
;W[nl]LB[mi:A]C[Black should finish white off by playing A.

Tough for white to survive.];B[qm];W[sk];B[rj];W[rn];B[mi]C[Good move.]
;W[lk];B[kk];W[ll];B[kl];W[km]LB[kj:A]C[Say if black play A...]
;B[mm];W[kj]C[Good move.];B[oh];W[jj]C[Black is too kind...]
;B[hc]C[How to best response H17? I think my reply is not good since black lives easily.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nr];W[jr];B[kr];W[ir];B[lq];W[cm];B[bl]
LB[fc:A]C[Instead of B13, white A to attack better.];W[bg];B[bh]
LB[fc:A]C[F17 better.];W[he];B[lc]LB[ec:A]C[Possible for black to play A too.]
;W[ld];B[kc];W[kd];B[jb];W[jd];B[ib];W[mc]LB[eb:A]C[Black E18 to form living shape better.]
;B[fc]C[Pretty bad sequence for me territerially.];W[li]LB[eb:A]
C[A mistake for me. Should be M12?

Yes, M12 locally better, but playing A is your last chance.]
;B[mj];W[ml];B[lh]C[Now white's center potential is gone...]
;W[nm];B[mo];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[mb];W[od];B[oe];W[eb]TR[mb]
C[Too late... 

With black N18, this group is alive.];B[ge];W[gf];B[fe];W[hf]
;B[jh];W[ki]C[From this point on, I have self-destructed and my N13 stones are caught. Please let me think if there is a better sequence to play.]
;B[kh];W[mg]LB[mh:A]C[Black should simply play A to connect here.]
;B[ni];W[mh];B[oj]LB[lf:A]C[Too cut black 3 stones, you need to play A to connect.]
;W[hh];B[lf]C[Game over at this point, I shall end the review here.

Hope you learn something from this short review.

Best regards, 
Jimmy];W[ok];B[nk]LB[ol:A]C[Should be A to connect, are you in time trouble?]
;W[om];B[ol]LB[nn:A]C[Before you capture the 2 stones, should play A first.]
