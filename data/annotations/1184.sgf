AB[pd][dp][dd][pp]C[Here's my review of the game you submitted; my apologies for taking so much time.

I've tried to strike a balance between tactical and strategic analysis; to this end, every 50 moves I've made a rough score of the game and given an overview of the main issues, as I see them.

I've also made liberal use of my SGF editor to enter variations and markings; if your viewer has any difficulties, let me know and I'll try to compensate.

I hope this review is helpful!

group here wasn't lost because it was indefensible, but because it wasn't defended enough.

loose on each side, as is seen later.];W[md];B[id]LB[ic:A][ib:B]

Also, W's stones to the left are too solid to be threatened by this move, and it doesn't have much influence to the right: thickness facing enemy thickness cancels out.]
