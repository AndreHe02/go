C[hello, I'm a french player, rated 12K on KGS

I tried to be as explicit as I could, but please excuse my language mistakes (as I'm not english of course).
This game were played on KGS between  a 11K rated player, and me. Komi is 0.5, the game ended with a white victory of 0.5 (jigo !).

* do not attack a group with a 1rst line move (well, a never seen strategy, don't know if it is so bad =) ) if he can excape , he has a lot of space around him
try something like var 2];W[kb];B[lb];W[kc];B[ja];W[jf];B[ge]

;W[hd];B[gg]LB[ic:A][fd:B]C[Here I think the white group is still not alive, I could attack around A. But perhaps this stone would be better around B.

* trying to attack while mapping out a big territory on the left
that is generally a good strategy
but your two stones are quite far 
form shimari so black has to protect later on];W[dh]C[I found this invasion a little bold. Perhaps I'm wrong ?

* white is quite worried so he try to do something 
of course when you have a weak group
it is not a good thing to built another weak group near it :)]

As far as I can understand this game, I think I should have be more protective with this group (the square stones). Keeping it alive would have gave me a sure win.

better to use that time to count and then to analize that small question :)]

Counting and keeping ko-threats in reserve for the future are also nice things to remember for.
