C[I'm not sure if it made a whole lot of sense for me to invade here instead of jump toward the middle, but it seemed to work out OK?

GTL: This move is fine, its just a matter of preference whether you want to invade or expand. If you want to go a little deeper, think about the end result of your invasion: how will his stones be positioned on the outside relative to your positions-is it weakening your position at D17 too much to let him build a huge wall around you? Here its too early to say much like that but those are the sorts of things you could look at.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pb];W[qb];B[nd];W[pe];B[oe];W[pf];B[hc]C[GTL: For example, now might be a good time to attack the bottom right, because if you attack from a distance you can reinforce your top right position at the same time]
;W[cg];B[pj]C[GTL: now instead he is taking a huge territory but at the same time pressing on your top right corner]
;W[fc]C[I wonder if something like O3 would have been better here, or even the invasion at R3. B pretty much took that entire area uncontested by the end of the game.

GTL: This move is definitely too small at the moment, i would go for the bottom corners]
;B[mq];W[ph]C[GTL: This move is also pretty conservative. Again, you let him attack your upper right corner and fortify his defenses for lower right at the same time, and this gives away most of the board. I would consider a move like R8 instead that allows you to split up his territory and use the strength of your stones in the top right.]
;B[qi];W[qh];B[pm];W[cj];B[he];W[fe]C[GTL: Dont feel that you always need to follow his moves. Look at his move at H15 compared to yours at F15. He gains a large amount of territory, and strengthens a weak group while blocking you in. Your move just adds a little to an already strong territory. I would play elsewhere for this move. The whole center is still open, and the bottom left corner can still be fought for.]
;B[qq];W[nh];B[nj];W[er];B[fr];W[eq];B[li];W[gg]C[I'm trying to learn from B's moves :-)

GTL: This is better, it pushes more on blacks stones, and now the two stones at H17 and H15 are weak. I would also consider playing somewhere like M13 or M14 for this move, to split blacks groups and strengthen your own.]
;B[lf];W[ig];B[jf];W[lh]C[GTL: This move seems to work against you, you let him strengthen him position on the outside too much for too little gain. I would attack in a way that forces him to defend within his own position. Plus this move now requires you to defend at N12 after he goes at L12.]
;B[kh];W[mh];B[ji];W[kg]C[I was trying to connect these two groups, but it didn't work :-(

GTL: This at least splits his groups, so I would just connect at K13 and move on, or go on the offensive and attack his stones at H17 and H15]
;B[lg];W[kf];B[jg];W[ke]C[These were kind of a waste of stones, I might have had more success playing L14 at K13. I think I was thinking that cutting through B's one-point jump was more important, but wasn't really thinking about how I'd survive after that.

GTL: These are the situations where its good to pause and think through the next few moves. As a beginner, I know it is hard to do all the time, but whenever you try cutting through like this, its good to check and see if its really possible.

One thing you could do from this position is try and attack from say J18. Then he has to struggle to kill your stones at L15 and stop you from connecting, and I think you will be able to kill H17 and H15 if you try.]
;B[le];W[je];B[ie];W[if];B[jh];W[ih]C[GTK: This move is too small]
;B[jd];W[fp]C[GTL: This is the right idea, you do need to attack him now, but this is too slow and too close to your own stones. He has the entire bottom right at the moment, so you need to really get in there and cut that territory up. This just allows him to wall it all off. Try attacking more around L4 or something]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[go];W[fn];B[ii];W[hi];B[hf];W[hg];B[hj];W[gi]
;B[gj];W[fi]C[I'm not sure how I allowed B to push so hard here, maybe it would have been better to play up here instead of pushing at F4?

GTL: See how for the last few moves, he played at his borders and you responded? This allowed him to build up this strong wall. What you need to do in this situation is respond with bigger moves, or ignore his moves when they're too small, and take the chance to invade. It should be clear that hes ahead at this point, so take a chance and cut out some of that territory.]
;B[oh];W[og];B[oi]
(;W[gl]C[GTL: Careful here, what happens if he plays at O13?

This is a good idea, dont let him finish his giant wall. Again since you are behind, a deeper invasion may be better.]

;B[ik];W[gk];B[ij];W[gb]C[I've run into the F17 F15 - H17 H15 square pattern a few times before, and I'm not really sure of the best way to play this border between territories. The plays I've tried (G18, G16) seem kind of small and ineffective. I was thinking about H18, but was afraid the stone might get cut off. Is there a good way of playing this area?

GTL: This is exactly the right move in this situation. H18 would definitely get cut off. You should always just quickly think ahead a move or two and check in any given situation, but for here this is right.]

;B[jb];W[gd]C[I think Q19, F2, etc. would be better here, since it looks like I gave up sente.

;W[rb];B[re];W[qe];B[qg];W[rg]C[I still have no idea what B was trying to do here, but I spent most of the rest of the game trying to figure it out :-)

GTL: If you had made a mistake he could have killed a group. You did fine by just playing carefully and making sure no shenanigans can occur.]
;B[rf]C[GTL: By this point though, his stones are thoroughly dead and theres no longer any need to respond]
;W[qf];B[sg];W[rd];B[sf];W[fs];B[gs]C[This mistake almost won me the game.

GTL: Very good catch!];W[gr];B[hr];W[gq];B[hq];W[ho];B[in];W[hp]
;B[ip];W[io];B[jo];W[hs];B[is];W[gs];B[jr]C[GTL: This was very nicely done]
;W[fg]C[I think this was unnecessary, since I could have blocked any invasion at E13 and E12, and the J13 group couldn't be captured.]

Black: 128 territories + 8 prisoners = 136
Result: B+6.5

GTL: Overall, I would try and not just respond to the opponent, but always look and see if there is a bigger move. If the enemies move does not put your group in immediate threat of being killed, theres often a much bigger move on the other side of the board waiting for you.]
