PL[B];B[pd]C[Hello!
Please include some questions and ideas to make the review both easier approachable for the reviewer and more usefull output for you :)
I just added a few variations and put in some general advise.

My comments will strongly differ from stronger players opinions.]
;W[eq]LB[cp:A][cj:B][cf:C]C[5-3 point(mokuhazushi). Usually should get reinforced on the point A soon. This would make a corner enclosure(jimari) working towards an extension(hiraki )around B or an approach move(kakari) around C if Black takes that corner next.]
;B[dd]LB[qp:D][qo:C][pp:B][cp:A]C[Looking at the position you see that Black has taken to star points(hoshi) on the upper side aiming for fast development. Your stone on mokuhazushi aims mainly for either securing the corner territory next or to get some points on the lower side. As being in a low position and the corner still open to attack I would make the jimari at A as this would be a perfect kakari for Black as well or take another corner with either B, C, or D. I personally would prefer C. 
See variations!
By the way you seemed confused about the whole game, so why dont you try to keep it simple and play ONLY(or mainly ^^) moves you understand and you have some followups in you head already when placing your stone.]

(;W[qf];B[pp]LB[rd:A][mc:B]C[Before attacking elsewhere I would strengthen one of my own positions. A suits best for me.
Black will answer around B probably.]
(;W[qn];B[ql];W[qj]C[As your extension above is not secure this counter pincer can get very complex.]
;B[ol]LB[qh:A][qq:B]C[I would take the 3-3 point directly to make sure life for the corner position.]

(;W[rp]LB[qh:A][qq:B];B[qq];W[rq]C[hm if you dont live there its 3 : 1 corners and about equal territory, but opponent has more influence.]
;B[rr]C[If you die there trying to live the game is already lost.
Thats why I would have invaded at the 3-3 point directly :)]

(;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]C[Black would like to play exactly where your giveaway stone lies, so he's forced into inefficient shape. Well maybe later on such a giveaway stone can be turned into a powerful weopon :)]
;B[qo];W[nq]C[Jump out freely towards your lonely 5-3 stone]
;B[rl]LB[ph:A]C[Now its 2 : 2 corners and equal territories if you manage to settle the 3 point extension. This can be probably be achieved somehow by playing at A.]
;W[ph];B[md]LB[rd:A]TR[qn]SQ[qj][qf][ph]C[This would be the most probable answer i guess.
You are still able to make live, but I would advise NOT to do so right now with A, but to play elsewhere(tenuki) using the square marked group's momentary stable status to try to run out the triangle marked group. This way you can utilize all three white groups on the right side alltogether. <<== "Make your stones work together"
Still note the possibility of a black kakari towards your 5-3 stone.]
;W[pn]LB[on:A]C[Now Black either has to kill white or to run out himself.
Probably he plays contact(=tsuke) at A, which is ineffective again and a mistake in my opinion.
I still added this variation as just on impulse I would have played there too :)]
