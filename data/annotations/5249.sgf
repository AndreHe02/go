C[hi, my name is Terence and I reviewed this game.

Because you left no comments is was a little hard to find what areas of you game to talk about.
There were two main situations i talked about, the lower left and then the right side. 
i have pointed out lots of little things, so try to learn something from each one. it is the little things that can make a difference and just an increase in concentration and a bit of reading out of positions can make a big difference. ofcourse it takes practise, so play more games!

hope this is useful!

(;W[el]TR[ho][hq]SQ[bk][ck][bl][cl][bm]C[this seems to be attacking black, but there is no point as black is already connected. The best option is to defend in a situation like this.

Black now has some opportunity at the squared points and the triangled stones are still under pressure]
