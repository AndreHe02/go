I played white in this game

Thanks in advance for your comments,
Terence];B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[op];W[ec]C[I played this because i didnt want black to play Q15 before I had approached his other corner]

;B[lp];W[dj]C[JC: this is wrong. There is a joseki going on on the bottom, black is building a wall facing the center and white can get territory on the bottom.  The wall is pointless (or can be made pointless), this advantage should not be discarded so easily.

JC: additionally D10 is high, C14 is Low, playing high emphasizing the center is silly when there is nothing to be gained there.  Just play low.

JC: playing low on the bottom first would have made the left side easy to play too.]
;B[fq]C[JC: Black got the better exchange here, N3 will not be well utilized and D10 will look silly now]

(;W[eq]C[dont know why i played this. is a pincer possible here

JC: this is very bad, it makes Black make excellent shape, this is a thank you move.  A pincer is an interesting idea, but I think you need to make your stones work together.  If D10 were at C10 then I would play D6 and aim at a pincer.  It'd work very well with C10.   playing C6 doesn't work well with D10 and it should be obvious now why D10 is not good.]
;B[fp];W[kq]C[JC: You like to leave joseki's unfinished.  The corner is not done, and you start another fight.]

JC: No, but at least you made the corner live in sente.];W[jg]
C[JC: Try to think of the end result at this point in the game.  If you cut your loses and just let thos white stones go, you will lose fewer points and be able to aquire territory someplace else.   I'm sure the difference is larger that 15 points.  This is the last chance for white to catch up.]
