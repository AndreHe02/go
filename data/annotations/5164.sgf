AB[pd][dp]C[pto: Hi, I am pto - about 6 kyu from Finland. I hope I can come up with something usefull for you.

This was difficult game to review. Mostly because I would have so much to say. I think I could review this game on daily basis for one month and still find something more to say of it. Great playing from both of you.

I need to cut out now, feel free to ask if anything is left out.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj];B[dj];W[fq];B[jp];W[cn];B[eo]
;W[cq]C[pto: To this point the game has been nice and good. At beginning black had two corners from handicap stones. Here black still has two corners, white has one and one is under negotiations.]
;B[eq]LB[cp:1][dq:2]TR[jp][nq]C[pto: Joseki move would be D3 or C4. This E3 has one fundamental weakness: sequence white E2, black D2, white D3 puts black E3 in atari which may cause lot of trouble in certain situations.

Then D3 or B4? This is interesting question.

D3 allows white to reduce the value of left side. Black K4 is nicely aligned to new black wall and black then would want to push towards white stone at Q4 to extend this framework.

C4 builds huge framework to upper side and black K4 prevents white control in bottom. I would propably pick this alternative because I like to play with frameworks.

Check the sequences from a joseki reference like gobase.org.]
;W[dr]TR[er]C[pto: This exchange fixes the flaw at E2. better to play C4 to leave the aji for later use. This is ajikeshi.]
;B[er];W[cp]
(;B[ho]LB[nq:A]C[pto: This is a bit too cautious for this point of game. Sure, white can make trouble with that single white stone.

Pulling it out would give him a heavy group that would be burden for rest of the game. And black could build impressive influence to some direction. 
Black A would be fine (variation). Be more active.];W[mq]LB[qh:3]
[pn:2][oq:1]C[pto: I usually tell not to use this long knight extension from 4-4 stone. Pretty much in every amateur game this has been a mistake. Now white has three weak points between these four stones. It would be better to play this at O3 so there would be only two weakness.

When you can give 15 min lecture about the difference of M3 and O3 then you can start playing this.

O3 is only move here.];B[jr]LB[qf:4][pj:3][pp:2][mq:1]C[pto: Playing like this is like being a tortoise who pulls his head down when in trouble. Too slow, too inefficient. It does not have the proper fighting spirit.

White has framework of four stones, but each of those are so far from eachother that black should have plenty to work with. Time to go all out.]
;W[ic]LB[fc:1][lc:2]C[pto: This makes the black framework a lot smaller. Nice use of miai with '1' and '2'. What ever black will do, white can get one of those. 

Playing this ensures that black can't make territory at upper side. White might also use approach at '1' to limit the growth of left side.]
;B[lc]LB[fc:1][kc:A][qd:2][pn:3]TR[qf][dj]C[pto: This is definatelly too close to black shape. Playing at 'A' would be a lot better. 

Playing at '1' would give black a corner enclosure that works well with D10. After white M17 black needs to defend the upper right corner with '2' for example. And that opens attack agains R14 so the fight moves naturally into white framework. Black has initiative and controls the flow of the game.

This is also one occasion where I might concider using G17 with black. Study the variations of two space extension on third line to understand the reason.

It might also be possible to raise risk level and tenuki. Leave this stone alone and invade white framework now for example with '3'. In a sence this would be playing the previous "flow" in reverse order, which might lead to interesting results.]
;W[fc];B[df];W[db];B[cc]C[pto: By choosing this side black has lost his big framework but got two pretty safe zones in return. After this black has to invade white framework to win the game.]
;W[of]C[pto: This is good move because it build the white framework at bottom, it defends agains black invasion to R12 and it leaves the black corner open for R17 invasion.]
;B[ke]LB[pn:1]C[pto: Wrong direction of play. White has solid group at upper side that is in no danger. This also does little agains white framework at bottom. If black dreams for center territory he has a long way to go.

Invade white framework now with '1'.];W[ie]LB[mo:1]C[pto: Atill wrong direction of play. Game will not be decided here. Taunt black with '1'. It isn't the best move, but it should make black panica bit.]
;B[kg]C[pto: Here black is slowly making central influence that will help to invade white framework or to make central territory. A bit too slowly I think. Rather just invade because white is already weak enough.]
;W[ch]LB[ke:1][mo:2]C[pto: White dares to invade deep. This is dangerous but white stones at J15 and C6 should help enough to make this possible. It would have been better to do this after '1'.

But you are still in the wrong direction.];B[dm]TR[ch]C[pto: This is one key position to make central territory. After this black attack agains white Q4 becomes a lot stronger. It does however little agains white C12. I would sugges D12 instead.

This also sets up a nice tesuji that works agains the white invasion.]
;W[eh];B[ff]LB[bf:1][cf:2]C[pto: White needs to live with this group. Black has too strong influence in center. If you have to live, better do it so that black loses something. Start with '1' or '2'.]
;W[jf]LB[bf:1][cf:2]C[pto: Wrong direction of play. Black should tenuki this to put presure on the weak white group. But black should leave the situation open. Having white weak group on left side makes invasion in right a lot easier. If white has weak group in left he can't allow black to make central influence on right. He has less options, he is more likely to get beaten.

White should aim for two eyes for his weak group and after that he should secure his invasion. Black is building central influence that will lead to terrible invasion soon. White '1' or '2'.]
;B[ih]LB[gh:1][fi:2]C[pto: This classifies as a tenuki, good, but black can have more courage and hit with '1' or '2' for example.]
;W[gh]C[pto: So close, so far. White can't connect. Trying to run further would give huge influence worads the right side. White has to live in left. Good thing is that white cuts black upper left corner with this one. Now also black needs to live there.]
;B[ig]LB[hg:1]C[pto: '1' might be better because black ends up having better and white worse shape after cutting.]
;W[bj]LB[dm:1]C[pto: Wrong direction. The upper black group is cut from center so playing up is also attacking against that group. Always try to attack while you defend. This also gives black a possibility to use the tesuji he set earlier with '1'. Do you see it? I didn't at this point.]
;B[bl]LB[bo:1]TR[ch]C[pto: But black did. Clever move, sets up a nice attack at '1'. This might be enough to make C12 to be too deep invasion.]

(;W[fj]LB[hf:5][kf:6][pg:A][el:3][fm:2][dn:1][fn:4][pn:B]TR[ch]
[eh][gh]C[pto: Now this is the part of the game I enjoy most.

I like this move, it is a bit daring because it does not make white alive but it is active and agressive. Has nice shape and nice continuations.

White push from '1' is interesting but not fatal yet. But if white had also '2' and '3' black would be in serious trouble. 

Next possibility is to cut at '5'. This forces black to live in upper left corner and then white can cut with '6'. Black has now weak group at center. 

Another alternative is pushing three times with '1' to '4'. This makes the single white stone inside black bottom side a lot more dangerous. My friends usually call these as "Saving Private Ryan" operations.

On the other hand, if black can get some more central influence he can try to peek with 'A' and then jump out and make a sabaki. And invasion at 'B' is tempting too.

Now we just need to decide some way to combine all this. None of these work right away, but after some preparations they will be usefull.]
;B[bg];W[cg];B[cf];W[bh];B[af];W[be];B[bf];W[ee]LB[hf:3][pn:2]
[mo:1]TR[ch][eh][gh][cj][fj]C[pto: This does not do much anything. Just forces black to make connection. Black becomes stronger agains marked white stones.

Choose one from '1', '2' and '3'.];B[ef];W[ed];B[cb]C[pto: Nice sanity check and big points.]
;W[dc];B[bd]C[pto: C16 or D15 would be better.];W[de];B[ce]
;W[ge]C[pto: This is some sort of protection because it may later make connection possible. It also serves as nice basis for attacking black stones at J12.

White group around E11 is weak but this should be still ok.]
;B[dh];W[di]C[pto: Bad for black, he forced white to make eye. Capturing makes white practically alive.]
;B[gg];W[hg];B[hf]LB[hh:1]C[pto: Black can't connect so it is better to stay on the other side with '1'. With that black can maintain sente and give more presure on white.]
;W[hh];B[gf];W[if]C[pto: G15 did the trick and now black has floating group at center. Whtie push at D6 would be dangerous for black.

Black is losing it. He has two corners and one small side agains one white corner, one white small side and one huge white framework. Black also has one or two weak groups in center. White does not have any weak groups.]
;B[jb];W[ib];B[lr]C[pto: This kind of moves belong to end game. Way too early for this. Invade white framework now. This only forces white to make that invasion more difficult.]
;W[mr]LB[lq:A]TR[qn]C[pto: I this this is better, makes nice corner. Tenuki to defend against Q6 might be better but this helps in building huge corner.]
;B[lp];W[nn]TR[qn]C[pto: Severe claim to the right side. Black needs to move in or lose. Corner enclosure at Q6 is better.]
;B[pl]C[pto:];W[qj]LB[ok:2][pn:1]C[pto: This is too passive. I would rather play '1' on the other side to fix the corner and make it a lot more difficult for black to live on the side. Most agressive move would be '2' that forces black to live on the side. Idea of this would be to build influence and then launch attack on center.]
;B[nl]
(;W[mm]TR[ig][kg][ih]C[pto: Playing on this side makes black turn towards upper side. The marked group will soon give support for this group and their combinet shape will be too good. Better to play on the other side then.]
;B[ml];W[ll];B[nj];W[oh];B[mh]C[pto: Black invasion was success. The shape he has is pretty much as good as it can. Both have two corners and some sides. It is almost even so white has beaten the two stone handicap already. 

Game is already mature enough to start end game, but only if both agree to start it.]
;W[qn];B[rm];W[qm]LB[rn:A]C[pto: Black shape is too good to be attacked. Playing 'A' would be better because it seals of the corner and provide nice followups if black does not defend.]
;B[ql];W[rn]C[pto: Corner is now pretty safe.];B[lj]C[pto: Perhaps too carefull, I don't think white can cut this.]
;W[lm]C[pto: Good solid answer for white.];B[jj]C[pto: A bit slow and small. Black group is strong and killing white is not realistic. Better to take some big points.]
;W[rd]C[pto: Good, 3-3 would be too dangerous now when white side group is surrounded. This makes big points and should be sente.]
;B[qc];W[go]C[pto: Too early. As such this will not work properly. White needs to build some outside support before doing this.]
;B[fp]LB[gn:2][gp:1]C[pto: Too submissive, '1' is better and '2' should be ok too but it leave more possibilitiese for white.]
;W[en]C[pto: Ajikeshi, invites black to connect and cut. Very bad move. Instead just push to make things more complicated for black.]
;B[dn];W[gp];B[gq];W[fo]LB[hp:1]C[pto: Rather play '1'. It helps you to escape and destroys black territory nicely.]
;B[fr];W[fl];B[hl]LB[hp:1]C[pto: Better to fix the wall with '1'.]
;W[ii]LB[hp:1]C[pto: White should destroy the black area in bottom with '1'. White group at left side.]
;B[kh];W[ik];B[hj]LB[dg:1]C[pto: Black is starting to warm up. Nice attack. Now white should either ensure connection or live. Just live with '1' and you don't need to wory it anymore.]
;W[ij];B[hk];W[ej]LB[dg:1][hi:2]C[pto: White should fix this group once for good. Capture with '1' to make it alive. If you want to be more active then use '2'. This one does not fix all the aji.]
;B[hi];W[fh]LB[dg:1][ei:A][gi:B]C[pto: If black plays '1' white is in trouble with only single eye because both 'A' and 'B' destroy the second eye. White only hope is then to connect out without getting cut anywhere and that will be difficult.]
;B[jk]LB[dg:1][ho:A]TR[hi][hj][hk][hl]C[pto: Based on earlier comment this is absolutely wrong move. Black should play '1' and then try to connect marked stones out.

Weakness of 'A' and marked black stones is whites only hope.]
;W[il];B[jl];W[im];B[hn];W[hm];B[gm];W[gl]C[pto: Given the opportunity this is not the best possible result for black. White took nice result by capturing those black stones.]
;B[fm];W[jm];B[el];W[gj];B[km];W[kn];B[kl];W[jn];B[mo];W[ln]
LB[no:1]C[pto: Play '1' even if black can cut. That way black cant attack white corner and white center group is ok because it can capture.]

;B[nm]LB[op:1][pq:2]C[pto: Connect with '1' and then connect out. This leaves nice attack at '2'.]

from here on, the order of moves may not be correct, but local sequences are mostly accurate (played as i can remember the moves)]
;B[fn]C[pto: Those stones are already dead.];W[rl];B[rk];W[sm]
;B[qk];W[rj];B[sk];W[sl]LB[sj:1]C[pto: Better to play '1'. If black now pushes white loses lot of points from that side.]

;B[lk];W[kk]C[pto: White took a clear victory and I think the reason is fairly clear. Black did not have fighting spirit.

Perhaps the reason was classical "I have handicap stones, the only thing I need to do is play safe and I win" -syndroma. Playing like that gives white too much space to build attacks.

At some point the game was a contest between two frameworks: upper left for black and lower right for white. Looking board now we can see that white framework is almost intact.

Also at some point it seemed that black was making central territory. White captured four stones and took it himself.

So for black my advice is to be more active and try to control the game.

For white I would say that try to  plan several attacks at same time and then combine those. Learn to spot the weak points and then play sequences that makes those spots even weaker.]

(;W[ok];B[ol];W[mj];B[ll];W[ln]LB[jh:2][cl:1][ml:3]C[pto: This variation has nice attack pattern. Black group is now a lot heavier and it does not work well with other black groups. Now white can combine attack agains three weak black groups.]
))
(;W[ce]LB[cf:1]C[pto: This variation is not good, white pushes too far and black can cut with '1'. Here comes the flexibility to play. What if black gives a small corner to white to kill the five white stones and to make a huge center moyo?

This kind of flexible thinking is really a big key in getting stronger. Turn the table around every now and then.]
