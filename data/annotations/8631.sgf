;B[pd]C[Summary];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[ej]C[Unusual move by white. Extensions on the fifth line are difficult to use as they do not put very much pressure on invasions, so White cannot expect to make any territory on the side. So White should have some kind of plan when playing this way.]
;B[jd];W[jq]C[This move feels somehow inconsistent after White's previous move, with one stone one the third line and one on the fifth. One gets the sense that it is very unclear what white is trying to do.]
;B[jj];W[nq];B[no];W[pr];B[cq]LB[cp:A][dq:B]C[The 3-3 invasion appears to work well in this situation, because it exploits the weakness of whites unusual strategy. 
Let's consider what will happen if white blocks at A or B.

---
Is this inconsistent with black's strategy?]
(;W[mo];B[mn];W[ln];B[mp];W[lo];B[np]C[White is being torn apart. Black is much better.0]
;W[mm]
(;B[mq]C[Is this also inconsistent? territory vs influence?]
;W[nn]C[White is given a free ponnuki which radiates influence that makes the Black moyo almost completely ineffective.]
;B[pn]TR[qq]C[Playing the 3-3 instead should be considered. This would make profit and strenghten Black at the same time, and the game would still be playable. 
Q6 on the other hand doesn't seem to do much at all, as it makes no points and any influence is erased by the White ponnuki. After R3 white would probably not want to play Q6.]

(;B[pl]C[Q8 does accomplish the goal of solidifying blacks ten points on the side while making sure that White capture the four stones. Since white get to connect and become super strong while gaining a lot of points, it feels like a very good deal for him. I think Black should save the stones 

---
Q5 better? The thought was to solidify right side and let him take O4 group in gote if white wants it.]
;W[oo];B[cf]C[Because the reviewer is too weak, questions like the first will not be answered. I will not even try to say which is the best possible move. 
Pretending that I have any idea what I am talking about is awkard enough.

As for the second question, I believe C14 is at least as good as, and probably better than, F15.
With all the white stones pointing into the center, any moyo-building attempt by Black is instantly reduced anyway.
Therefore, it is a good idea for Black to try to play aggressively instead.

Best tenuki? F15 better?];W[fd];B[gd];W[ec]
(;B[gc]C[Black would normally play atari first, in orden to give white ugly shape.

(;B[nc]C[Because this move ensures that Black will gain a very broken shape, as indeed happened, Black is very likely to be better off by simply backing of with the nobi to m17.]
;W[od];B[nd];W[oe]C[This exchange causes more pain to Blacks shape.]
;B[qf];W[ne];B[og]C[M16 instead?];W[lc];B[ld];W[me];B[lb]C[L17 would remove all prospects of attacking White, and would indeed be a game ending mistake.
M18 is the right move here. White's cut is actually not so very fantastic, we will soon see why.

---
L17 instead? Game ending mistake letting this invasion live so easily?]

(;B[jb]C[Big mistake!];W[ic];B[ib];W[ob];B[mb];W[hd];B[hc];W[id]
TR[jd][ld]C[White's made a dangerous invasion but ended up with a huge wall, while Black has to live on the second line. The marked stones have become completely useless.]
;B[dq]
(;W[eq]C[By allowing Black to cut, White gives away a large corner. White should prehaps consider playing the normal, non cutable move instead.]
;B[ep];W[fq];B[do];W[fp];B[eo];W[fo];B[po];W[op];B[dk];W[dl]
C[I don't understand the reason for this very strange move. White obviously expects black to respond at E9, which appears to be just horrible.]
;B[el]C[It would be interesting to know about the idea beind chosing this instead of E9.  Since there is reasons provided, I will simply move on, as I don't have anything to say about this except the obvious.]
;W[ek];B[dj];W[em];B[fl];W[dn];B[fm];W[en];B[co];W[fn];B[cl]
;W[dm];B[ei];W[gk];B[hl];W[gl];B[gm];W[hm];B[im]C[When Black let his group die, the game is pretty much over.  I was asked to keep the review to the earlier game, so the will be no comments on the following moves.

The game started with White playing an odd opening strategy, and the game seemed like it would become a promising one for Black. 
But white played well and managed to get back into the game, and after taking a stone at 22 and some more at 39 the situation was becoming increasingly desperate for Black.

White did play some reckless moves which could have given Black an opportunity turn the game around, for example during the invasion starting with 57. 

It feels like Black played a bit passively, being too happy giving away everything with asking for anything in return. 
In the lower right, White should have been punished, but got away with a huge territroy and awesome thickness.
In the upper right, White made a reckless invasion but somehow he ended up with a great wall while Black made some points on the second line.

I suggest that in the future, you try to think more about whether you have gained anything from the stones you sacrifise.
If you make a sacrifise without gaining anything from it, that means the moves you played before were useless and no better than passoing.

I also suggest studying the broken knight shape. It is in most cases a horrible shape, and it seemed to appear a bit too often in this game.]
