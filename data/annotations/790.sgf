LB[qk:a][qj:b][qh:c]C[First question: How do I respond to this?

Is it possible to probe around (c) somehow?

The two standard plays here are (b) and [c\], both of which
may lead to complex fighting. Compared to [b\], playing [c\] is slightly better for the bottom right, but may hurt the top right corner.

I would play [b\]]
(;B[qk]LB[rk:a][rl:b]C[I was worried white would play [b\] - and I'm not sure why white played [a\] instead.

Playing [b\] causes W to lose connection with their top stones. See Var2]

(;W[rk];B[rl];W[qj];B[pl];W[pi]LB[oj:a]C[Does this demand a response?  It seemed small, so I took an oba, but soon I found myself wondering if that was a mistake.

I dont think so, [a\] isnt really that big. It doesnt affect life or death of any group. It doesnt take any territory. It does help W develop thickness, but I think its better to break up W on the LHS.]
;B[cj]LB[cn:a]C[oba

Playing in the center of the side is usually done when
both corners are equally important. However in this case,
W would like to develop a moyo rising from the bottom.
This move helps him [see var\], I would have played at
[a\] to restrict the size of the bottom moyo]
(;W[oj]C[seems pointless- just one stone, but...  I suppose it radiates power across the board?

It is aiming to develop the bottom moyo, i.e. imagine a
line of W stones along line P.. the bottom is then looking
very big. Later in the game you will have to try to
neutralise that moyo];B[cf]LB[cj:a][ci:b][ck:c][cl:d][ch:e]
[cn:f]C[too thin?  Perhaps A should have been B or C instead?

When you have a stone at [a\].. W has the option of  approaching at [d\] or [e\]. Imagine if you played [b\]  instead of [a\], then W could play at [c\] and make the bottom bigger. If you played [c\] instead of [a\], W would play [b\] to make the top bigger. If you are going to play in the middle of the side when both corners are equal, [a\] is best.

However in this case, because the bottom is bigger,
[c\] would be better than [a\] (even better is the aforementioned [f\])]
;W[pk];B[ql];W[ol]LB[om:a][fp:b]C[I don't think there's much point in playing [a\]. It doesnt
give you territory or thickness, but it gives W massive
thickness and makes the white moyo very big. I would
try to neutralise the potential moyo by playing at [b\].];B[om]
;W[nm]LB[nl:a][nn:b]C[At this point there is no point in playing [a\], the effect of
just playing directly at [b\] is exactly the same, and does not give W points for capturing the stone at [a[ (see VAR)]

[jm:b]C[poor move?

It is if you are just going to throw it away, however if
after W [a\] you played [b\], you would then be limiting the size of W's bottom moyo]

LB[jq:a]C[[a\] is better.. the actual move doesnt take much territory and lets W develop more thickness on the outside.]
;W[jp];B[kq];W[jq]C[this seems like a bad trade for black - yes?

Yup, see previous comment, but even from an overall perspective, B pushing out has probably ended up with the same amount of points as if they didnt. However W now has a huge amount of thickness which will determine the character of the rest of the game.]
;B[kr];W[fc];B[hc];W[bd];B[ef];W[jr];B[cn];W[cl]LB[dm:a][eo:b]
C[How best to handle this invasion?

Indirectly. The W stone on the star point doesnt have close support.. by leaning on it B can develop thickness and then counter-attack W's invading stone. See variation for black
at [b\] rather than [a\].]

;B[fp]LB[eo:a][gl:b]C[B is too weak here and should play a move that can keep connection with the three stones above. [a\] looks better,  W would probably then play around where B played (F4), and then B [b\]]
;W[fo];B[eo];W[ep];B[go]LB[fn:a][gl:b]C[This didn't go well at all.  What should I have done?

Treat the previous stone as a sacrifice stone and play at [a\], then after W's next move (G5\], play [b\]]

LB[fk:a][bo:b]C[why?

I think just paranoia.. but even that reasoning is odd.. if I
wanted to waste a move here to ensure that B died, I would either play [a\] and make two eyes, or [b\] and connect to the corner]
;B[fs];W[es];B[gs];W[hq]LB[hr:a]C[Playing [a\] first is a bit better.. you should always try to avoid answering a peep directly.]

;B[ff];W[co];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt]C[The game is over.  Final score:
   White = 87 territory + 14 captures + 0.5 komi = 101.5
   Black = 59 territory + 4 captures = 63
White wins by 38.5.

I think the main strategic reasons for B's loss, was that B did not consider the thickness  that W generated on the right side of the board. B's side group tried to push out from the side, but all this did was give W more thickness when B should have been reducing the W moyo from the other side. Then, when W invaded B on the RHS, B counter-attacked very strongly, which considering Ws thickness was incorrect, Bs lower right side group should have tried to lean on W's corner and should not have played so thinly that W could easily split the group in two.

On a tactical note, B sacrificed many stones so that by atari-ing W, B could force W to play in a particular way.
In fact, if those stones were not sacrificed, W would still have had to play in that particular way, because if they did not, B could THEN go back and play the previously sacrificed stones, only in this case some W stones would be captured.]
