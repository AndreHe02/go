Thank you for reviewing my game.

I played white. I had played go before (around 1d) but I stop during 4 years. I came back to the game a few days ago.

---

Hello,
hopefully I can provide some pointers. Enjoy.];W[pp];B[pc];W[dp]
;B[jd];W[pe];B[nd]C[> A little boring, I'd play pincer.];W[qc]
;B[qb];W[qd];B[qh]TR[rb]C[This move seems creedy and abusive but I did'nt know how to respond to it

> I don't know, seems playable to me. You can play triangle in sente, so black just exchanged the corner for playing on the side.]

(;W[pg]C[> This is not ideal, you should have pincered. Your group has nothing to worry about since you can play S18 any time.]
;B[qk]C[> Now black has a base, so he gained the side without any trouble.]
;W[qm];B[pd];W[rb]C[After the game I felt that this move may be a bold considering the cut at r 15]

(;B[pb];W[qg]C[> This fixes the cut, well done.];B[rh];W[ph]
TR[cf][cj][jp]C[> Not sure what this accomplishes, however. Are you sure it's more important than any of the marked moves?]
;B[ok]C[> Again, not needed, black group is strong and cannot be attacked.]
;W[pj];B[pk];W[oe]TR[mi]C[Here I hesitated but I did'nt wanted my group to be cut off from the center and I wanted to be able to kept pressure on Black's group

> This doesn't pressure anything. Also, if you wanted to go into center, then play faster, at the triangle.]
;B[ne]C[> Bad, black could have played tenuki.];W[nf]C[> Again, too focused on the local unimportant moves.]
;B[nq]C[> Good! Although playing at bottom left would be even better.]

(;W[np]C[> Usually white should play pincer here, but with the black stones above it's probably not ideal. See the variation.]
;B[lq]C[> Very bad, black should have played hane.];W[oq]C[> Correct punishment.]
;B[nr];W[mp]C[> A mistake.];B[qq]C[I did'nt know how to respond and as you will see the result was bad for me

> Yes, black punished N4 well. Your corner was too open and you should have defended.]

(;W[pq]C[> This is bad. Just P2 to cut off the black stone.]
;B[qr];W[pr];B[ro];W[qo];B[rn];W[rm];B[qp];W[qn];B[qs];W[lp]
;B[ps];W[mq];B[or];W[sq];B[rq];W[sr]
(;B[sp]C[> Not optimal.];W[mr]C[> Correct!]
(;B[rr]C[This move is not necessary, black was already alive]
;W[om]C[> If you wanted to attack the black group, it would have been better to start from S10.]
;B[qj]C[> This is bad, the base is still open. S9 would build some eyespace for black.]
;W[pi]C[> This is zero point move. In future games, try to make the effort to not respond to your opponent's every move. Usually it's best to just tenuki (unless your opponent is 9p and known what he's doing, of course). If you really want to play locally, you can steal black's base with T10 but it's not an urgent play.]
;B[ml]C[> Black has the right idea of running out but N9 would be a much better shape.]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[mk]C[> Very good, you punished black's shape.]
;B[mj];W[lk];B[ni];W[mf];B[lj];W[ll]C[> Too defensive. You should have continued to attack.]
;B[mm]C[> This is nonsense.];W[lm];B[dj]C[> Absolutely terrible move. Although the black group cannot be easily killed, you can gain much by attacking it. This is a perfect example of big vs. urgent play.]
;W[dl]C[> Not urgent. Black group screams that it wants to be attacked!]
;B[fq];W[eq]C[> This makes black stronger. Very bad for attacking. You should have played pincer.]
;B[fr]
(;W[dr];B[jq]C[> Too greedy. Just J3 would be proper.];W[hq]
;B[fo];W[fp]C[> Very bad. Never push into a place that that cannot be cut, you just make the opponent stronger a lose potential (e.g. for the peep at G4 later).]
;B[gp];W[ep];B[gq];W[go];B[ho]C[> Bad, just H4 because he needs to play there later anyway.]
;W[gn];B[hp];W[kq];B[kk];W[kj];B[jk];W[ki];B[li]C[> Terrible, M12 is the correct move.]
;W[jm];B[hn];W[gm];B[hm];W[gl];B[hl]C[> Black gained a lot here by connecting two weak groups. White, on the other hand, only gained few points of territory.]

C[> I'm not quite sure what strategic purpose have last few moves accomplished, for either side.]
;W[lh];B[mh];W[lg];B[nh];W[oj];B[nj]C[Here I wasn't sure to be able to kill his group so I decide to take the stones in r12 to have a larger territory on the top right and still keep sente.]

(;W[qi]C[> I think you could have killed, see the variation.]
;B[rl]C[> Excellent.];W[ri];B[sm]CR[am][bm][cm][cn][co][cp]
[cq][cr][cs]LB[cc:A][fc:B][ld:C]C[Up to this point, I consider the situation as follows :

- I made a good exchange on the right by capturing the two stones (of course it would have been better to kill the group but...)
- black has a moyo on the top left but it has many weakness like and I can reduce it
- my territory on the left at the bottom is almost territory

So I thought my objectives were to reduce or invade blanck's territory and strengthening mine.

> Summary:
There have been many unimportant moves played following your opponent around. If there is time, always consider whether your opponent really played the best possible play, and, if not just ignore their moves.
Second problem was failing to gain much by attacking middle right group (it should have died!). There have also been several small mistakes, but otherwise you played quite principled and focused game. Good luck with improving and I hope this review has not been a loss of time for you ;)]
