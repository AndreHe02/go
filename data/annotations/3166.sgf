C[I suppose this is a classic example of what happens when you have no center influence in the end game.  I thought I was doing good until about half way through when i realized I was completely shut off from the middle.  Any advice / suggestions would be appreciated.

Nacho: Hi there. I'm Nacho, and I'll review this game for you. I hope it turns out to be useful for you. Comments are (should be) preceded by "Nacho:"]
;B[qd]C[UchwSasuke [13k\]: u2];W[dc];B[oo];W[dp];B[fq];W[iq]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co]C[Nacho: A big mistake by white]
(;B[bo]C[Nacho: But this is not the right way to punish (see variation)]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[eo]C[Nacho: This apparently eliminates the problem of your stone, but I'm not sure it's needed after theprevious exchanges]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cm];W[nq]
(;B[oq]LB[qq:A]C[Nacho: I'm not an expert in the 5-5 point (who is, anyway?), but Kogo's Joseki Dictionary lists A as a reply to this approach (see var)]
;W[np];B[op];W[no];B[qp]LB[nn:D][qn:C][qo:B][qq:E][or:A]C[Nacho: Again, I'm no expert in the 5-5 point, but I'd say this move is probably not necessary. Or, if necessary, I'd play either at A first, or at B or C in the first place. 
Or maybe the hane at D. 
I don't like this move because the stone you just placed serves no further purpose during the game. Even one space nearer to the border (E), would at least help you when (if) white plays A.]
;W[pj]
(;B[kp]C[Not good?  probably should have played at k3?

Nacho: maybe it is too deep. But as the white wall still has no base, it is ok, I think.
K3 would definitely be too deep. Maybe you would be able to connect to the right, but most probably you'd die.
K4 is probably what I would play in this situation];W[io]
(;B[ql]TR[kp]SQ[io]C[Nacho: What about the triangled stone? By forgetting about it, it means that white's marked stone was free for him, and it gave a very nice shape to his moyo.]
;W[qf]TR[ph][qh]C[Nacho: White leaves a nice invasion point there :) I love it when they do this!]
;B[od]LB[mc:A]SQ[dc]C[Nacho: Given that white is low, I would have played low. But that's maybe a matter of taste. Anyway, you should be aware that there is now a certain weakness at A]
;W[ln]C[Nacho: So he kills your stone....]
(;B[qj]LB[ph:B][qh:A]C[Nacho: Not good.
This ruins your chance of dividing white's stones by invading at A or B, thus reinforcing white.
And it doesn't give you that much extra points. See variation for an example.]
;W[qi];B[pk];W[oj];B[qe]LB[jc:B][de:A]C[Again, you reinforce white, and you don't get much for yourself. There are still a couple of big points left on the board, there is no reason to play this.]
;W[pf]
(;B[fc]C[Nacho: I don't like the direction of this approach. White is in the fourth line on the left, and on the third line on the top, so you'd prefer him doing his points there, not on the left. Besides, with this you're giving away the corner. (or the side, given the way you played next)]
;W[df]C[Nacho: Now this seems too wide and is obviously leaving some weakness...]

(;B[cd]LB[mc:A]C[Nacho: ... but... this is bad. White will let you live, build a magnificent wall, and then play around A, which has a nice continuation below your shimari.]
;W[dd];B[ce];W[de];B[cf];W[hc]C[Nacho:This looks too narrow]
;B[jc];W[gd]C[Nacho: And this too slow....J16 would have put more pressure on you]
;B[lc]LB[mc:A]C[Nacho: N17 (A) was better, although this isn't bad]
;W[kf]LB[ie:C][nf:B][nl:D][em:A]C[Nacho: Now is the time to get into the center (maybe you should have gone earlier, but....)

Probably A is best for that purpose. But white will still enclose a big portion of the center. Just try to reduce it as much as you can afterwards. He's still open at B, C, and D, they're not very big, but you'll be able to eat up some of his points.]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[ch];W[eg];B[dh];W[eh];B[dj];W[fj];B[nl];W[ll]
;B[fl];W[ek]
(;B[dn]C[Hum... should have guarded at D9

Nacho: No, D8 was best for that purpose.  (see variation)];W[do]
C[should have played d9 then d8 and i would be able to cut if he put in atari.

Nacho: See vars]
(;B[em]C[Nacho: Again, D8 was best.];W[dl]
(;B[dk]TR[fl][em][dn]C[Nacho: The center is bigger. You should protect your stones!]
;W[dm];B[el]C[For some reason I did this... O_o

Nacho: ouch... This doesn't help you. You loise your point on the side, and don't hurt white. Besides, learn to avoid the empty triangle. If the play you thought of makes an empty triangle, make sure it is the _only_choice.]
;W[cl];B[bm];W[en];B[ei]C[Nacho: Bad. You help white to close the wall! And you don't want that...]
;W[fi];B[ej];W[fk];B[fh]LB[ie:A][nf:C][mi:D][mk:B]C[Nacho: This won't work. You should focus on reducing, although I don't think you can reduce enough at this point....
A, B, and C are good places to try to get a foot inside the center....
Maybe D, threatening both B and C, would be best, although I don't know if it would work.]

;W[gi];B[fm]C[Nacho: Those stones are trapped in a ladder];W[gm]
;B[fn];W[fo]C[Oh yeah.. ladder...

Nacho: :)];B[jg];W[kg];B[nj];W[ki]LB[lj:A][lk:B]TR[fg][gg][hg]
[jg][fh][ih][hi]C[Any hopes to salvage those?  It seems I entered a hopeless battle...

Nacho: I don't see much hope. But maybe A or B lets you use their aji. Judging from his last play, white is _very_ afraid of you saving those stones. Use his fear :)]
;B[fe];W[fd];B[jf];W[je];B[he];W[hd];B[id];W[ke];B[if];W[gf]
;B[ge];W[ff];B[hf];W[ji]C[I resigned here. I checked the score before I attempted the center invasion and he would have ended up winning by about 30 points, so i had to do something...   How what you have pushed into the center?  Or was it possible with the little influence i had?  I think instead of that useless L4 stone I should have made sure my group could get to the middle.  I think I was a little worried with the moyo he formed there.   Any advice on what I did wrong would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time...

[Nacho\]: I think your main mistake was not getting into the center earlier. You had many chances to do so. There is a proverb, that there are no points in the center, and that's true, unless your opponent lets you make them. Then there are lots of points there. I would say the main reason why there are no points in the center is that there are so many points there, that no one would let his opponent get them.
You know, I am a territorial player, and I used to have this same problem; every game I ended up getting the sides, and my opponent got the center. I improved more than two stones just for realising that I must not let my opponent get all the center. 
Another important thing is that stone you let to die in white's territory. The invasion was good, but you have to follow it.
Well, this is all. I hope this review is useful for you. I did have a good time reviewing this game. If you have any further questions, just send me an email (nachof@internet.com.uy)]
