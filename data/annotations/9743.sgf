AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,

despite of a 4 stone handicap, I lost this game pretty badly. I would be grateful if you could show me my mistake and also some hints how to improve. At some points I have inserted some of my own thoughts after the game.

Cheers,
om3

Hey om3, I'm Greg, a Canadian 3d. I'll prefix all my comments with g: I think what really threw you off early game was white playing a little unconventional and that threw you off, made you play a little reserved. Also, there were a few things you missed reading-wise in fights.]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[fq];B[jp];W[cn]LB[dn:1][eo:3][fp:2]
(;B[dn]C[om3: In this position, I usually play this move to attack f3, but considering the result I got, I am thinking if e5 or f4 may be easier to handle in the end?

g: This is generally okay. d6 is rarely seen in pro games, but is still totally fine. f4 I think is also totally fine. However, I think you made a mistake in the followup. See variations for more comments.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp];W[dr]LB[dk:4][dl:5][fp:2][eq:1][cr:3]
C[om3: This move was new to me, and I didn't know how to handle it. Usually people extend along the left side here. My idea was now to protect the cut, then attack w d7 group.

gc: Yeah this move is definitely a little odd for white. I spent a while thinking here. It looks kinf of silly, but I think the best move is to simply defend the corner. See  variations.

I agree with your idea behind you move, but I disagree with the move itself. If you want to follow up by protecting the cut, f4 (2) is better than e3 (1). e3 unecessarily strengthens white.

The other problem later up which I'll discuss more was your choice of attacking move. You'll see in variations I play D9 (4) instead of D8 (5).]

(;B[eq]C[gc: This helps white.];W[er];B[fp];W[gq]LB[dj:2][dk:3]
[dl:1]C[gc: You played (1), suggested (3), but it turns out in this shape, (2) is the nicest.]

(;B[dl]C[om3: After the game I thought that a more distant play could've been more effective...

gc: yep.];W[cm];B[em];W[ck]C[gc: White is very comfortable now :/]
;B[gp];W[hq];B[hp];W[jr]LB[pj:1][mp:2]C[om3: I found this result pretty bad for me, but not hopless. W got territory on both sides, but at least I have some thickness.

gc: True. I think to follow up on this thickness, instead of playing on the let side now, you can consider connect the bottom stones.]

(;B[pj];W[cf]
(;B[df]C[om3: As the left side looked rather uninteresting, I tried this attachment joseki to get a big corner.

gc: This move is generally not considered good unless white has approached on both sides. 

First, you say you emphasize territory, right after you've built lots influence. Seems a little couterintuitive.

Second, this move doesn't actually get you much more than playing F16 or F17. It also doesn't guarantee territory as you saw in the game.

Try and avoid this move in the future.

Yes the left side is uninteresting, but that means you probably shoulnd't play there, but D14 is playing there. F16 looks way nicer to me.]
;W[dg];B[ce];W[ef];B[de];W[fd]LB[fe:2][cg:1]C[gc: I think you can play a bit more forecully here.  The cut at f15 (2) looks really nice.]

(;B[cg];W[dh];B[bf];W[db]C[gc: this looks a little ridiculous to me.]
;B[ec]C[om3: Seeing a shape like this, I cannot hold myself from moving in between. However it seems that this allowed w to take away my corner easily. Is it better to defend at c17 in this kind of situation?

gc: c17 is super slack. I think this is correct.];W[eb];B[fc]
;W[cc];B[gd]C[om3: White stole my corner, and I got some thickness again.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[rj]LB[qi:2][qj:1]C[gc: So this move is generally an overplay for white, but you let him off easy. When black plays (1), white gets nice and settled. But you have a nice move at r11 (2)]

(;B[qj];W[ri];B[rk];W[re];B[rd];W[rf]C[om3: Now, I should probably somehow make use of my thicknes... but how? It seems w has now weak group at all.]
;B[qh];W[rh]LB[ci:2][qk:1]C[gc: So there is a nice weakness to exploit on the left which I think now is the perfect time. r9 (1) was very small. Look at variations for (2).]

(;B[ql]C[om3: Too slow?];W[lc];B[nc];W[hc]LB[fb:2][hd:1]C[gc: You mention this in your comments. "If f18 (2) is sente". You are correct. It is sente. And so this would have been much better.]

(;B[hd]C[om3: I wonder if f18 was an alternative here...];W[fb]
LB[ic:1];B[ic]C[om3: This got me into a fight I didn't really think about.

gc: I do think this is the best move. The follow up is weak.]
;W[gc]LB[ib:2][fe:1]C[gc: f15 (1) looks really important here, but it isn't. You'r group has a ton of eyespace on the left. You should attack M17.]

(;B[fe];W[id]C[gc: This hurts.];B[ib];W[hb];B[ha];W[gb];B[jd]
;W[ie];B[kc];W[ge];B[ed];W[he];B[fd];W[ld];B[je];W[me]LB[gf:1]
[if:2][jf:3]C[gc: j14 (2) or k14 (3) look like better options to me.]

(;B[gf];W[hg]LB[ig:1][jg:2]C[gc: j13 (1) looks better than k13 (2) here to me, but I think they're both okay.]

(;B[ig];W[jf]LB[hf:1][if:2]C[gc: You missed something nice here.]

(;B[hf]C[gc: This move is fatal. This really hurts you. It looks like you were too concerned with attacking him while your own group is still too weak. You should try and make you upper-middle stones strong first.]
;W[if];B[kf];W[jg]C[om3: Now I think that I should've just given the ponnuki to w here, pulling the "emergency brake" with m15...

gc: Yes that's better, but still not great.]
(;B[ih];W[ff];B[gg];W[hh];B[gh];W[jh];B[hi];W[ke]C[gc: Ooph. That hurts.]
;B[ji];W[lg];B[ci];W[el]LB[dk:2][fl:1]C[om3: Now, the centre moyo appears to be my last chance. How would you judge this position?

gc: I would say white is winning pretty solidly. The center moyo just won't be big enough. However, here I think you can fight harder.]
