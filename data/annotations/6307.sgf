C[REVIEW FOR BLACK 
(REVIEWER'S COMMENTS IN ALL CAPS)

FIRST, I CONGRATULATE YOU FOR PLAYING SO WELL AFTER ONLY 3 DAYS.

GENERALLY BLACK PLAYED BETTER THAN WHITE BUT WAS NOT IMMUNE FROM SERIOUS MISTAKES AND OVERSIGHTS!  YOU WILL SEE FROM THE COMMENTS, ESPECIALLY STARTING WITH MOVE 65, THAT YOU WERE LUCKY TO HAVE WON THIS GAME.  

FORTUNATELY WHITE DID NOT PLAY WELL.


*suiboku*: Hi!];B[jj]C[Nonaz: hi];W[dd]C[On a small board I think I can defend a corner from the star]
;B[jd];W[cj]MA[dj][dk]C[THIS IS OK FOR WHITE BUT EITHER X IS BETTER]
;B[dj]MA[jg]C[THIS WORKED FOR BLACK BECAUSE WHITE PLAYED POORLY.  AS A GENERAL RULE, AVOID CONTACT MOVES EARLY IN THE GAME

I WOULD PREFER SOMETHING LIKE X ON THE RIGHT SIDE, ESTABLISHING TERRITORY.



I'll try to bring up a base an the bottom right of the board, attacking whites corner in the meantime

YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STONES ON THE BOARD TO DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE.  BUILD A BASE FIRST!]
;W[ck]MA[ci]C[I WOULD PREFER X FOR WHITE.];B[dk]LB[jg:X][hk:Y]
C[he can have the corner, I want to go to the right

ACTUALLY YOUR MOVE IS ACCEPTABLE.

BUT IF YOU WANTED TO LET HIM HAVE THE CORNER SO THAT YOU COULD TAKE THE RIGHT, YOU SHOULD HAVE PLAYED AT X (BETTER) OR Y.

OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY POSSIBILITIES.];W[dl];B[ci]
C[well not the whole corner];W[di];B[dh]MA[ei]C[that shouldn't have happened, what now?

BLACK 11 IS ON THE WRONG SIDE.  X IS BETTER BECAUSE IT REACHES TOWARD YOUR CORNER STONE AND OFFERS SOME POTENTIAL TO FORM TERRITORY ALONG THE BOTTOM.]
;W[ei]C[GO BACK AND READ MY PREVIOUS COMMENT.

NOW REMEMBER THE MAXIM, "OPPONENT'S NEXT MOVE IS USUALLY MY BEST MOVE!"

TRY TO THINK OF THAT EVERY TIME YOU PLAY.];B[ej]LB[el:Y]CR[dj]
[dk]MA[hc][jg][ch][hk]C[uhoh

THIS IS AN UGLY, HEAVY CLUMP OF STONES AND ALSO WHAT IS CALLED AN "EMPTY TRIANGLE" (RIGHT ANGLE SHAPE MADE BY 3 ADJACENT STONES). THAT IS A NOTORIOUSLY BAD AND INEFFICIENT SHAPE.  (SEE GO BOOKS OR WEBSITES FOR EXPLANATION.) 

THE GAME IS STILL YOUNG.  IT MAY BE BETTER TO ABANDON THOSE STONES AND PLAY AT ONE OF THE POINTS MARKED X.

THE POINT MARKED Y MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR BLACK BUT COULD LEAD TO COMPLICATED PLAY; CHECK THIS OUT YOURSELF.]
;W[fk]MA[fj]C[WHITE MISSES THE CHANCE TO PLAY AT X AND KILL BLACK.]
;B[fj]TR[fm][gm][hm][im][jm][km][lm][mm][ml][ll][kl][jl][il]
[hl][gl][fl]SQ[ma][mb][mc][lc][lb][la][ka][kb][kc][kd][ld][md]
[me][le][ke][kf][lf][mf][mg][lg][kg][kh][lh][mh][mi][li][ki]
[mj][lj][kj]CR[fk]MA[jg]C[off to safety, connection to my stone on the star might provide me with the means to conquer the bottom

"MIGHT" IS THE KEY WORD.  AS LONG AS WHITE'S MARKED STONE SURVIVES, IT IS WHITE AND NOT BLACK THAT WILL WIN THE BOTTOM.  

HOWEVER, THE BOTTOM IS "LOW" (MEANING CLOSE TO THE EDGE\] AND NOT WORTH AS MUCH AS THE RIGHT SIDE.

TRIANGLES REPRESENTING THE POTENTIAL BOTTOM TERRITORY ADD UP TO 16 POINTS.  SQUARES REPRESENTING THE SIDE ADD UP TO 30, ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH.  THAT IS WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR BLACK TO PLAY AT X.]
;W[cl]CR[ei][di]MA[ek]C[X IS BETTER FOR WHITE (FIGHTING WILL BUILD TERRITORY LOW ACROSS THE BOTTOM).

WHITE CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THE TWO MARKED STONES.];B[el]CR[fj]
[ej][dj][dk][jj]MA[eh]C[unless white goes there first


I WOULD HAVE PLAYED AT X -- ESPECIALLY ON A 13 X 13 BOARD WHERE THE FIGHT IS CLOSER TO THE MARKED CORNER THAN ON 19 X 19.

THIS MOVE SUCCEEDED FOR BLACK BECAUSE WHITE PLAYED POORLY.  WITH PROPER PLAY BY WHITE, BLACK'S 5 MARKED STONES ARE AT RISK.  BLACK CAN CONCEIVABLY SAVE THEM BUT ONLY AT THE COST OF ALLOWING WHITE TO MAKE TERRITORY ON THE BOTTOM.]
;W[ch]C[... BUT WHITE MISSES THIS AND CHANGES THE DYNAMIC.]
;B[bi]MA[ek]C[protecting my stone while not letting white connect

VERY GOOD; BETTER THAN CONNECTING AT X, WHICH WOULD OCCUR TO SOME HIGH-KYU PLAYERS (NOTICE THIS WOULD MAKE A SOLID CLUMP OF STONES EVEN LESS EFFICIENT).]
;W[bj]CR[dh]MA[eh]C[TOO CONSERVATIVE.  WHITE SHOULD HAVE PLAYED X TO TRY AND CAPTURE THE MARKED CUTTING STONE.]
;B[dg]CR[ci][bi]MA[eh]C[and the other one

BLACK SHOULD PLAY AT X INSTEAD TO PROTECT THE TWO MARKED STONES. THESE STONES ARE NOT VALUABLE IN THEMSELVES BUT MAY HELP BLACK REDUCE WHITE'S TERRITORY.]
;W[bh];B[fi]MA[jg]C[can't save m, do something with the other 2 there (d5-6)

GOOD.  THIS WILL GIVE BLACK INFLUENCE IN THE CENTER, ALSO PROJECTING TOWARD THE RIGHT SIDE.  PRETTY SOON BLACK WILL HAVE TO PLAY AROUND X TO PREVENT WHITE FROM PLAYING THERE.]
;W[ai];B[eh]MA[fg]C[WHILE THIS MOVE DOES THE JOB, IT LEAVES AN AWKWARD AND INEFFICIENT "EMPTY TRIANGLE" SHAPE.  YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME CONSTRAINING EFFECT ON WHITE PLUS BETTER SHAPE FOR BLACK BY PLAYING AT X INSTEAD.]
;W[ci];B[gk]C[taking the area];W[em];B[fm]C[protecting the side, looks dangerous but i dont think it if i pay attention]
;W[cm];B[fl]C[but i don't really wanna pay attention, or white to move there. i'm not sure why i shouldn't just kill]
;W[hd]MA[hc]C[THIS IS A GOOD MOVE FOR WHITE (ALTHOUGH X MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER).

HOWEVER, WHITE DOES NOT FOLLOW UP PROPERLY.];B[hf]MA[jg][kf]
C[he takes the upper left, large but i want to connect to my earlier wall

THIS WORKED BECAUSE WHITE PLAYED POORLY.

I THINK EITHER X WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFER FOR BLACK.];W[df]
(;B[ef]MA[fg]C[extending earlier wall while attacking

X WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER (SEE VARIATION).];W[cg];B[de]C[really just expanding my wall as far as deep as i can get into 'his' corner]
;W[ce]C[but he decides to split his forces];B[cf];W[kf];B[kg]
MA[kh]C[an invasion! I hate that

CONTACT MOVE IS NOT THE BEST DEFENSE BECAUSE IT STARTS A FIGHT. PLAYING AT X IS BETTER.]
;W[jg]C[and he's going for it];B[lg]C[protecting to keep them on the side where I have more stones]
;W[jf]LB[hg:Y][if:X]C[WHITE X WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT (POSSIBILITIES TO MAKE TERRITORY, CONNECT TO OTHER STONES, EXTEND TO Y, ETC.).]
;B[jh]C[at least securing part of the corner];W[ie]CR[hd][dd]
C[OK, SO WHITE WILL CONNECT -- BUT THIS DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH NOW.  HE NEEDS TO THINK URGENTLY ABOUT USING HIS TWO MARKED STONES TO BUILD TERRITORY ON THE TOP.  OTHERWISE HE RISKS LOSING THEM ALL, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED.  YOU CAN TRACE THIS PROBLEM BACK TO WHITE'S PREVIOUS MOVE.]
;B[id]C[i'll invade his corner too then];W[he];B[ib]LB[ld:E]
[eb:D][fd:C][ee:B][bf:A]CR[jg][kf][jf][ie][he][hd]MA[fa]C[THIS IS GOOD BECAUSE IT SETS UP A POSSIBLE MONKEY JUMP FOR BLACK TO PLAY AT X IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

WHITE NEEDS TO ATARI AT A AND THEN PLAY AT OR AROUND B, C AND D ON FUTURE TURNS.  THAT WOULD CONNECT TO WHITE'S MARKED STONES AND ALLOW SOME TERRITORY IN THE UPPER LEFT CORNER.  HOWEVER, BY THIS POINT BLACK HAS ALREADY WON BY ROUGHLY 30 POINTS EVEN IF WHITE PLAYS WELL.

I DID NOT THINK OF WHITE E, WHICH IS WHAT HE ACTUALLY PLAYED NEXT, AND THAT IS MAYBE AN EVEN BETTER MOVE!]
;W[ld]C[THIS IS A GUTSY SENTE MOVE FOR WHITE.  YOU COULD PROBABLY ARGUE THAT IT SHOULD BE WHITE'S GAME-WINNING MOVE!  

HIS THREAT IN THAT CORNER IS EITHER TO REDUCE BLACK OR MAKE EYE SPACE FOR HIMSELF IN THAT CORNER.  AND, WHILE YOU'RE BUSY DEFENDING, HE CAN CONNECT HIS STONES AS PREVIOUSLY SHOWN.]
;B[le]LB[gb:C][hc:B][kc:A]C[not making him get an eye yet in this part

GOOD UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  A, B AND C MIGHT ALSO HELP BLACK.]
;W[ke];B[lf]C[and resecuring stone and territory, made a nice place for an emergency eye]
;W[kd];B[ic]LB[md:10][hb:6][ia:5][je:2][jc:3][lc:9][kc:8][ig:7]
[if:6][ge:5][gd:4][jb:4][hc:1]C[IT MAY ALREADY BE TOO LATE FOR BLACK (SHORTAGE OF LIBERTIES).

I HAVE NUMBERED THE LIBERTIES FOR YOU TO VISUALIZE THIS.  WHITE HAS 10; BLACK HAS ONLY 6 (LIBERTIES 1, 2 AND 3 ARE SHARED).  IN ANY FIGHT WHITE WILL KILL BLACK UNLESS BLACK CAN RAPIDLY EXPAND HIS LIBERTIES.  IS THIS POSSIBLE?

NOTICE THIS SITUATION ALL STEMS FROM WHITE'S MOVE 50.];W[jb]
;B[ja]C[moving in];W[kb];B[ka];W[lb];B[la];W[mb];B[jc]MA[gb]
C[this move was probably better spend elsewhere, but we wasted territory that he could have gotten

BAD MOVE, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT INCREASE BLACK'S LIBERTIES.  X IS BETTER BUT WOULD PROBABLY NOT HELP ENOUGH.]
;W[kc]CR[ld][kd][lb][kb]MA[lc]C[ACTUALLY THERE IS NO REASON FOR WHITE TO DO THIS.  THE MARKED STONES ARE CONNECTED VIA WHAT IS CALLED A "BAMBOO JOINT".  BLACK CANNOT BREAK THE CONNECTION OR PREVENT WHITE FROM MAKING AN EYE AT X, SO WHITE COULD HAVE PLAYED MORE EFFICIENTLY ELSEWHERE.]
;B[md]LB[gb:X][hc:Y]CR[la][ka][ja][ib][ic][jc][id][jd]C[keeping him small with only 1 eye

OK, BUT YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE MARKED STONES.  THEY HAVE FEWER LIBERTIES THAN WHITE AND CAN PROBABLY BE KILLED.

YOU SHOULD HAVE PLAYED SOMETHING LIKE X TO CREATE MORE LIBERTIES AND/OR EYE SPACE FOR YOURSELF.

IF WHITE PLAYS NEXT AT Y THOSE STONES ARE DEAD.  THAT GIVES WHITE EYE SPACE AND A PROBABLY A WON GAME!!!

(SEE VARIATION)]
(;W[mc];B[me]C[and protecting

SEE NOTES ON PREVIOUS MOVE; THAT SITUATION IS MORE URGENT.]
;W[ig];B[hg]C[dont let this strong thing enter towards my other wall]
;W[ih];B[ji]C[or worse];W[hi];B[hh]C[he mustn't connect, and be kept small. he doesn't yet have 2 eyes]
;W[ii]MA[hc]C[TOO BAD FOR WHITE HE DIDN'T SEE THE NEED TO PLAY AT X.]
;B[ij]C[keeping my corner in fragile domination];W[gi];B[gh]
C[i semi-connect!]
(;W[if]MA[hc]C[why would he do that?

GOOD QUESTION, SINCE HE CAN STILL KILL YOU BY PLAYING AT X INSTEAD.

(SEE VARIATION)

THAT IS WHY MY COMMENT AT MOVE 65 WAS SO TERRIBLY IMPORTANT!!!]
;B[ge]C[now keep this side in check, preferably trapped with no more eyes]
;W[ha];B[hb]C[dont connect];W[gb];B[fa]LB[da:C][dc:B][cc:A]
C[sacrifice offence

???  I DON'T FOLLOW YOUR LOGIC HERE.  YOU HAVE FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES LOST THE GAME AND ARE WASTING THIS MOVE.  

YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO MAKE A SMALL TERRITORY IN THE UPPER LEFT CORNER BY PLAYING AT A, B OR C.

SEE VARIATION AFTER WHITE'S NEXT MOVE.  THAT WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.]

(;W[ga]C[WRONG MOVE -- SEE VARIATION.];B[gc]C[closing in and separating]
;W[hc]MA[fb]C[he cant get me

YES, HE CAN!  ALL HE HAS TO DO IS PLAY AT X.  BUT HE IS TOO STUPID.]
;B[fb]C[and he wont anymore here

YOU WERE LUCKY TO GET AWAY WITH THIS.

NO FURTHER COMMENT.];W[ma]C[but he tries];B[ia]C[so i'm forced to save myself, kill him, make an eye, connect and set up a good line of defence to the left side]
;W[kk]C[but as expected, he invades with agression];B[gj]C[first secure this thing if it gets out of hand bottom right]
;W[kh];B[ki]C[whats this? atari];W[lh];B[mh]C[atari];W[li];B[lj]
C[atari.. he didn't pay as close attention to the lessons];W[hj]
C[whats this? breaking out?];B[hk]C[i think not];W[ik];B[jk]
C[attacking, he cant kill me in one stone and i can defend]
;W[jl];B[il]C[or strike first];W[kj];B[ik]C[cant let him take me.. i'm safe now]
;W[gl];B[gm]C[but he's persistant];W[mj]C[no leave my friends alone or i kill the black guy]
;B[mi]C[your coming here forces me to eat them!!];W[lk]C[you meanie! i'll kill this one or secure my corner]
;B[mk]C[yum fried brains];W[ml];B[kl]C[thats a vulnerable barricade]
;W[mj]C[hmm fried brains];B[li]C[defending then, he will have to too, then where can he go?]
;W[mk];B[ll]C[where?];W[jm]C[not there];B[mm]C[just to be sure, can't have him trap L2 M2]
;W[tt]C[most appropriate];B[bf]C[but i'm not finished yet];W[af]

C[he gives up];B[gd]C[closing the last liberty, for some reason under the impression that its the only way for my upper left group to count too]
;W[tt]C[my first win, but i don't feel it was a very sure one. I imagine myself
securing to little territory when opponent closes in
attacking to much and large groups (but only this time it worked out)
not taking territory enough when its easier to get (empty and more at the beginning)
not defending enough];B[tt]C[but i'm not sure how to implement solutions to this into my play, and especially, when

my opponent played like rubbish, he later showed me that he could easily wipe the floor with me (he was 17k)
his mistakes and desperacy, and eventually his giving up gave me the advantage for once]
