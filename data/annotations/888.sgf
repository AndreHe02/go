;B[pd]C[Some general comments.

1) White played better, particularly at the start. However in the end you could say that white lost by making a series of silly mistakes. (Why is it that when one has made one silly mistake one then immediately makes 3 more?)

2) So the game reaches a point where white is winning. However the game is certainly not over at that point. The difference is that black has 100 points of solid territory. That is in the bank, there is no way for white to take it away. White has 200 points of moyo. White cannot claim to have won the game until about 110 points of that moyo has become secure territory.

So white should not care about endgame moves that gain a little bit of territory round the edge. White should be trying to find moves that turn large chunks of the moyo into secure territory.

3) In my comments I have made lots of careful estimates of the territory. Don't let that intimidate you. I mostly did it because I need to practice counting big territories. I certainly could not have counted territories that accurately when I was 15 kyu, or indeed 5 kyu.

However it is a good idea to try and estimate the territory whilst playing to see who is winning. Even a rough estimate can be a big help in planning your strategy. Even if it is only Black is winning by a lot/the game is close/white is winning by a lot. The more you try to estimate like this the better you get at doing it.

In this game it was easy. Black had lots, and white had about twice as much. When you are leading by a lot you do not need to worry about every single point. You should start asking yourself "How can I loose this game?". In this game white could only loose if black invaded the moyo and did lots of damage. So white should have played moves to make the invasion harder.   4) About cutting points. See the comment on move 178.

5) I have made too many comments about this game. You should probably not try to understand everything, just try to get the general ideas.

If there are any of these points that you would like move clarification about then I would be happy to discuss them. Just ask.

Tim.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[kd]
(;B[nc]C[This is small.

In these sorts of games where black has one side and white has the other there are basically 2 big moves. There is the extension across the top to about K10, and the extension across the bottom to about K4. They are miai. That is if black play one white should play the other, and vice versa.]
;W[lp]C[Good. White grabs the other big point.]
(;B[mq]C[This is also very small.

The remaining really big point on the board is around D10. Both players would like to get sente so that they can play there. If black plays this close to the white stone if seems likely to me that white will get sente.]
;W[dj];B[kq]C[This is another very slow move by black.

Black F3 is better.];W[ip]
(;B[iq]C[This does not seem quite right to me.];W[hq]C[Be careful. This move is great if it works, but if it doesn't it could be a disaster.

The point is that black has been playing quite slowly with N3, L3 and J3. This is slow and inefficient, but it does mean that black is quite strong.]
;B[jp]C[The cross-cut might be better for black.];W[jo]C[Again this is potentially dangerous. However it is also possibly a tesuji. It makes good use of the white stone at M4 which ends up as a peep.]

(;B[io]C[So it looks like is must be this atari.];W[hp]
(;B[ko]C[This is very bad. It does not seem good to give up the black stone at J5. White will just build a lovely thick position at the edge of his moyo, making it bigger.]
;W[jn];B[lo]C[And besides black has to play this irritating defensive move.]

(;W[lm]C[This is a good direction to play in. It expands white's area and it reduces black's. The risk is that it can be cut. In other words this is slightly bad shape for white.]

(;B[nn]C[This is a very small move. It does not add much to black's position at all, and it does not seem to threaten white at all.]
;W[nf]C[Again a good direction to be playing in. Is it too thin?]

(;B[qf]C[This is another very slow move.];W[ni]C[This may be taking a good idea a little bit too far.

As you said the board is roughly diveded into 1/3 black and 2/3 white. However the black area is starting to look like finished territory. The white area is still only moyo. There are lots of places where black can invade or push in from the edges.

There are 2 ways to make a moyo bigger. You can play moves round the edge to make it cover a larger area. There are also moves inside the moyo that make it harder to invade. For example in this game white would like to play F16. Now would be one opportunity to play this move.

Another way to look at this: You can think of a moyo as sort of 50% territory, or maybe 30% territory or 70% territory. In this game suppose that we say that white has about 30% of about 180 points. There are 2 ways to make this better, you either make the moyo biggger so that it becomes 30% of 200 points, or you make it stronger so that it becomes 40% of 180 points.

Of course it is very hard to know what these numbers are, I am just guessing, so it is very hard to say which option is better.]
;B[nk];W[mk];B[nj];W[mj];B[oi];W[nh];B[oh];W[og];B[pg]C[I think that this sequence helps white more than it helps black. It does make more the 25 points of extra territory for black. In fact you can now count the black territory, and there is about 100 points of it. That is a lot of territory. But black has made white a lot stronger in the centre. White's moyo cover about 200 points worth of territory. I think that it will be difficult for black to destroy enough of it.]
;W[md]C[This is a small move. This is not the biggest gap in the edge of the white moyo. I think that it is definitely time to play F16.]
;B[lc]C[This is another very small move. It just helps white to strengthen the edges of the moyo some more.]
;W[kc]C[Good.];B[mc];W[ld]C[This move is not absolutely necessary, but it is very thick so it is really quite a good move.]
;B[nd]C[Another very small move. It will help white more than it helps black.]
;W[ne];B[of]C[Same comment again.

White could consider ignoring these moves. Black will not be able to do much damage. But if you opponent is helping you then why resist.]
;W[ng];B[oe]C[You now really can count the black territory. I make it 95 points. White is now so much stronger in the middle that I really want to be white. If I was white I would now play E17. It is then very hard for black to invade the moyo. Actually if black invades then white probably won't kill him. But that is not the point. White will not have to kill black - just make 150 points worht of territory whilst attacking.]
;W[ir]C[Correct. This is the biggest endgame move around the edge. (about 15 points in sente to black is black plays here first). They don't come much bigger then that.

However this is not the most important point in this game. The important question is how much of the white area can black destroy? So white should have played E17. And black should ignore this move (white cannot do that much damage really) and invade somewhere. Just invading at the 3-3 point is not good enough. Black F17 is one idea. Or how about C10?

In fact black should probably resign.]
(;B[jq];W[jr];B[kr];W[ln];B[mo];W[kn];B[nm];W[ml];B[nl];W[lb]
C[Both players have been playing really small moves for the last 10 moves.]
;B[qo]C[This is realy silly. Black has not got enough territory to win, and anyway, I don't believe that white can invade this corner.]
;W[mb]C[Another very small move.];B[nb];W[mm]C[This is a neutral point. You should have takes black's hint form move 57 and defended in the middle of your moyo.]

(;B[cf]C[At last.

Now what should white's plan be in this position?]
(;W[cg]C[Well now that the endgame has been played you can caount the black territory exactly and it has become 99 points.

So white should be playing to get 100 points out of his moyo. Well that is a bit risky so we may as well play for 130 points to be on the safe side. What I mean is that there is a huge amount of white area and so it is quite safe to let black live in one bit of it, provided that we can strenghen the rest of it at the same time.

So the plan should be to allow black to live in a small confined space on the edge. There is no need to try to kill black and to try could risk disaster. The thing is to find good moves for white that build up white's position.

This is not a good move. You should not play in contact witha  stone you wish to attack. A good move is C16.]
;B[dg]
(;W[df]C[No, no, no. This is totally the wrong idea.

The time to play messy cross-cut things is when you are desparately trying to find two eyes in your opponent's sphere of influence. In this game it is black who should be playing the cross-cuts, not you. This just helps black.]

;B[ea];W[ga];B[dd];W[ci]C[This is not at all necessary. The place to defend is G15.

This has turned out to be quite a good result for black. However it is OK for white. A useful comparison is what would have happened if black had strted with the 3-3 invaison.   With the 3-3 invasion black gets 11 points and white looses 28 points.

Here black gets 10 points and white looses 33 points. About 4 points worse.

Of course white is still winning overall.]
(;B[cn]C[It looks like this should die.

I think that black would do better to start at C4, or possibly C3.]

In general you can get away with having 1 cutting point, but you would rather that it was protected. When you have 2 cutting points close together you should worry. When you have 3 cutting points close together you are probably in serious trouble.

So 4 cutting points ... I don't like it.
