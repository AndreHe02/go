C[Hi, i am playing black in this game.  The game ended with me winning by 0.5, so obviously my opponent kinda gave me a hard time.  Can you please focus mainly on reviewing for black, but if you feel something should be mentioned about white, then please do.  My main concerns are what I should have done better, and how to punish my oppoent when he makes a bad move.

Thank you in advance.

Hello! 
Thank you for the interesting game to review. I hope, that I answerd all your questions, but if you have some more, don't hesitate to ask me.

;W[pq]C[GPG [8k\]: hi];B[dc];W[qj];B[cp];W[cj];B[ce];W[cq]C[This move took me by surprise, it looks like an extremely bad move, but I was not sure how to respond and how to kill it.

FR: Black can't really kill c3 stone, but he can enclose it in the corner and build a perfect outside wall. This is normally much better for black, than for white.
(white 3-3 attachment to 3-4 stone can be good, if white can effectively neutralize black's wall. For example see variation.)]
(;B[dq]C[FR: this is the best answer for black];W[cr];B[dr]
;W[bp]LB[bo:A][co:B]C[FR: black can think about building a solid wall (B)]
(;B[bo];W[co];B[dp];W[bn];B[bq];W[ao];B[br];W[do]
(;B[hq]LB[oc:B][kd:A][po:C]C[FR: this is the first black mistake so far. 
Black corner is already alive, so you don't need to build "base" for d3 stones.  Because black corner is strong, h3 is too close to your strong poistion and so is overconcentrated (the rule "play away from thikness" is true not only for enemy thickness, but for your own too!). 
This move gives you about 5-10 points of territory. At this stage of the game this is kinda slow. 
Locally e5 is much bigger (see variation), but black  also can play tenuki (A-C moves)]
;W[ep]C[FR: white takes the very big point.];B[eq];W[fp];B[fq]
;W[hp]C[FR: compare this result with the variation at move 20. 
Do you see the difference?]
(;B[ip]C[This is not good right? Should I have played G3 instead?

FR: This move is better, than g3, but I think, j3 is the best move for black (see variations).]

[co][do][io][jo][ep][fp][gp][hp]SQ[iq][jq][er][fr][hr][jr][es]
[fs][gs][hs][is][js]C[FR: After h3-e4 exchange black has about 10 points on the bottom and white has  a very, very big wall. This result is clearly bad for black.]
;B[lq];W[mo]LB[mo:B][lq:A]TR[qj][pq]C[FR: "A" move is very slow. It gives black just about 6 points. It's too small for now! See variation for futher explanation...
"B" stone instead works good with the marked stones and builds a moyo on the lower-right. So A-B exchange isn't good for black.]
(;B[qg];W[qf];B[pf]C[Is this good? or is S14 better?

FR: This move is better. s14 is too passive.];W[qe];B[pe];W[rd]
;B[qc];W[rc]
(;B[rb]C[FR: this is mistake led to enormous troubles for black! r18 was the right move and it's very good for black. See variation.]
;W[rg]
(;B[rh]C[FR: with r10 stone double-hane is too dangerous. Just q13 was good enough for black.]
;W[rf]
(;B[qi]LB[pd:A][pg:B]C[FR: with 2 cutting points now black is in real trouble.  
Maybe it was better to play q13 and let white connect?];W[pd]
;B[pc];W[od];B[ph];W[oc];B[pb];W[ob];B[qa];W[sb];B[sg];W[oa]
C[Ok, so here black is dead on the top right corner.  So how should I have played to prevent this?  Can you please play out several possible variations for me?

FR: your main mistake was s18 instead of r18. 
Also you played some very aggressive moves, trying to kill white, but leaving weak points in your own position. Try to play more solid moves - solid position is the best preparation for attack. You can't really attack your opponent, when you are weak yourself.]
;B[sf];W[re];B[sa];W[pa]
(;B[qm]LB[ic:B][qo:A]TR[qg][ph][rh][qi]SQ[qj][rj][sj][qk][rk]
[sk][ql][rl][sl]C[FR: the marked black stones are really strong ("ponnuki cost 30 points"), so you must use their strength to play actively. r7 is close to your strong stones - white must be happy to give you the marked territory and enclose the corner with r5. 
"A" was the most active move for black, "B" is ok too.]
(;W[qk]LB[qo:A]C[FR:  It's much better to sacrifice r10 stone and protect the corner.]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[rp];W[rq];B[pl]C[FR: good move! Now white stones are in trouble.]
;W[oj]
(;B[kc]TR[oa][ob][oc][od]C[FR: l17 is too close to white's wall. Play away for thikness! J17 or even h17 is better. To use his wall, white should counter-attack with j17.
But... why you don't want to continue attack on p10 stones? o9 will be a good move to start it.  Playing some attacking moves in sente is better, than closing territory in gote.]
(;W[ok]C[Now white stones became stronger and black 4 stones are in danger.]
;B[ch]C[FR: this move helps white to build a huge moyo in the center.  If you want to make some points, play h16 instead. 
But... are your r7 stones really ok? See variation.]

(;W[km];B[ll];W[dk];B[dl]LB[hd:A][gf:D][sq:B][mr:C]C[was this a bad move? Or did I just play it wrong?

FR: You played a good game! Three main tips to improve is: 

1 - Play away from thikness!
2 - Play urgent moves instead of big moves!
3 - Defend yourself before starting the attack.

this 10 rules of Go will be very useful to learn: http://senseis.xmp.net/?TenGoldenRulesOfGo

I'll also recomend you to read something abotu good and bad shapes and ofcourse to solve life and death problems to improve your reading.
Good luck and enjoy the Go!
