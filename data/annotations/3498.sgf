Actually this handicap is much larger than I deserved. 17k is about my true strength. However, I'm having considerable trouble convincing KGS of this :)]

(;B[oq]C[Under the circumstances, this seemed better than the attachment move.

R> Not really a recommended move without a B stone around K4, and W should reply by re-inforcing at O4]

(;W[pn]
(;B[oo]C[The idea here was to retain access to the centre. It doesn't look like any Joseki you'd find in a book, though, does it ?

R> It seems a good move];W[po];B[qp]C[R> good];W[qf];B[qh]C[R> Good Pincer, W should jump out to P14, or invade @ R17, or even counter pincer @ R10

Difficult to tell which W should do - this makes it a good pincer.]

(;W[nd];B[oc]C[R> Mmmm, not too good - W should just play O17, and then can start to look towards the top left, and shutting the top right in]
;W[of]C[R> Too early for W to play here, O17 is the important place]
;B[qk]C[R> Good, but O17 is still important, this move puts pressure on Q5&6 - so is playable here]

(;B[qm];W[pm]
(;B[nn]C[This isn't looking great. White's wall is bigger than blacks territory. Rigtht ? Hence this move that tries to push towards the middle.

R> W's wall is looking thin, W needs to use the wall effectively, whilst B has solid territory.

Looks good for B.

O6 is slow. the situation on the right can be left for now - C10 or D10 looks very big]
;W[fc]C[Good move by W, works well with O16, and O17 if he can play there too]
;B[jc]C[R> Good answer - W must now protect against K17 linking up to P17, K10, and also protect F17 at the same time.]

;B[kd];W[id];B[ic];W[kc];B[gd];W[ke]C[Sacrificing that stone turns out to have been a good move - the black wall that develops at the top becomes quite influential.

(;B[ad]C[R> See alternative];W[ab];B[cd];W[ea];B[dj]C[I reckoned this extension was justified, and it does seem to have worked. Possibly a little closer would have been better ?

R> It's a good point to play, Also K3/K4 look good];W[ca]C[White didn't really need to do that, right ?

R> Right, W has played a -1 point gote move :-)];B[hq]C[So black extends.

R> Yep, but why are you scared of O3? - K3 limits the room for an extension from O3. Daunting any hope W has of rescuing that stone]

;W[fq];B[er];W[fr];B[fs];W[gs]C[So in retrospect, I think this black shape is dead, or maybe a ko ? In this case it worked out OK, as white miscalculates later.]

G4, would be OK, but not much, J5 also OK.

;B[kn];W[ml];B[ll];W[mm]
(;B[mn];W[lk];B[kl];W[io]C[So white's shape on the right looks a bit dodgy. Had I been playing white, I would have emphasised preventing the black corner connecting to the groups in the middle, as the corner looks alive.

R> So do the groups on the outside :-)];B[in];W[hg]
(;B[he]C[So black was trying to prevent white getting too much in the middle here. Obviously the previous stone was an attempt to get into the space between the two thick-looking black groups. I feel I (black) responded badly, as the following moves all look a bit limited and heavy

R> See variation];W[if];B[ie];W[je];B[hf];W[ig];B[gg];W[gh]
;B[fh];W[fg];B[gf]C[So black responds to the cut by falling back to the line between the wall and its extension from earlier. This would have been easier if it had been closer, but then the other group would have been harder to build.]

(;B[hj]C[So this is obviously wrong, especially given the white cut that follows. Its hard to know how far to fall back from  a wall like that. In this case black ends up with only three points in the middle !

R> W is very strong here, so play away from the strength. Falling back to H9 would have been good as is protects the cut at f8]

;W[ch];B[bg]C[So in retrospect, I didn't spot what white was up to here. I reckoned he was trying to live inside, so this is an eye stealing move.]

SKinahan [21k?\]: Thanks - I enjoyed that.

R> It looks like W should have resigned a long time ago, and the attempts might have worked, but they seemed to be getting more futile as the game went on.

Here are some pointers - a kind of summary: -

1) In the middle game you need to consider a few more alternative moves e.g (H15 vs J14)
2) Avoid contact when attacking, as it only makes your opponent's stones stronger. Obviously there comes a time when contact is necessary, but when your opponent's group is weak don't go making him stronger - that's what he wants :-)
3) In the opening you can play elsewhere, not just on the side with the most stones. Especially so when your groups are safe from attack. (Taking the C10 or D10 point around move 24).
4) In the endgame be carful of moves that look like they protect, but leave you vunerable (For example B10 - which you got away with, but shouldn't have).

I've included examples in brackets so you can see to where the pointers relate.

Enjoy your games :-)])
