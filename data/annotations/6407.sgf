N[Study game]PL[B];B[pd]C[[Malweth\]: I noticed a few areas where you could stand to improve, especially along the lines of Life & Death and Attacking with thickness (not using thickness to create territory). 

It would also be good to review the important parts of the board, where groups are still not settled and in high positions. Low positions and playing against settled or thick groups is usually "uninteresting" (e.g. low value).

I hope these comments help you improve quickly!

Hi, I'm Daniel (14 years old, Portuguese), it's the first time I'm sending a game to you, and I'm doing it because I like to see reviews, they help me to improve, and I'd like to have one with a game I've played, so... here it is. Thanks for commenting amateurs games.]
;W[dd]C[[Malweth\]: Although playing against software can be good practice, it's usually best to play against real people.

----
In this game I played Black, against TensaiGo softwere. I'd like you to tell me my mistakes, please.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]C[[Malweth\]: Although this move is joseki, K16 is a good alternative. This keeps in mind the overall idea behind the ni-ren-sei (black's 2 star points).

This move cannot be faulted, though.];W[nc];B[cc]C[[Malweth\]: This is the correct response.]
;W[ci]C[[Malweth\]: This made your response sente, so you get an early lead. White needed to play C17 first.]

(;B[lc]C[[Malweth\]: This seems to be in the wrong direction. The D18 group is very low (all 3rd line and below) so the low stone here is less interesting than Q14, for example.

See the variation.];W[qc];B[pc]C[[Malweth\]: This is the only move in this situation, but see how this influence affects the top side...]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]C[[Malweth\]: Now you have a wall facing low stones. There is no moyo and the possibiliites of moyo are only moderate.

This is why M17 was not the best move.];B[qm]C[[Malweth\]: This jump is in the wrong direction. White's stones at R14 are low. White has more possibility for expansion along the lower side, so that is where the board is most interesting for black.]
;W[jq]C[[Malweth\]: This extension is actually very good for White. Black will feel silly playing P3 or Q3 now, but will be open at the 3-3 if the play is around N3.]

(;B[dm]C[[Malweth\]: The normal approach is better here. Usually C6. C11 is too far away to be a pincer.

See variations.];W[fp];B[id]C[[Malweth\]: This seems small, though it is an important point. Your D7 group is weak and your Q4 group can be invaded. The protection of one of these seems best. 

Note that D7 does not have a good follow up as C9 is too small an extension. C4 is the best move locally.

You could also try for moyo on the top side with G15, but O17 still has a lot of life.]
;W[mq];B[qj]C[[Malweth\]: P3/Q3 is better.];W[qq];B[pq];W[rp]
C[[Malweth\]: White could probably do better...];B[qp];W[rr]
;B[qr];W[rq];B[pr];W[rn];B[qn]
(;W[rs]C[[Malweth\]: This move dies... see variation.];B[ro]
C[[Malweth\]: Good kill.];W[so];B[qo]
(;W[co];B[rm]C[[Malweth\]: This was totally unnecessary. See variations.

whites group is dead so, here I was more confortable :D];W[fm]
C[[Malweth\]: White is causing you big trouble now!!];B[dj]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[fj];B[di];W[dh];B[ei];W[ki]C[[Malweth\]: This move is vacuous. Something with meaning around here might be O18 (small considering the fight on the left). Better is for white to create a wall to push the floating black group into... G15 springs to mind... H16 is probably even better.]
;B[fg];W[eg];B[ff];W[gi];B[eh];W[ch];B[fk];W[gk];B[sn]C[[Malweth\]: You should work on Life & Death. I suggest books 2 & 3 of "Graded Go Problems for Beginners."

Do not look at the answers until you are 120% certain your answer is correct. Visualize all variations for both sides, even the ones you're certain don't work.

In other words, White is already dead... doubley.];W[ck];B[fi]
;W[el];B[dk];W[cl];B[dl]C[[Malweth\]: It might not look like much, but White has gained a lot here. There's little you could do - they were all forcing moves. White IS ruining any chance of attack, but this failed with L11.

...];W[pf];B[of];W[og];B[ng];W[oh];B[oj]C[[Malweth\]: Black at O13 was bad... See variation.]

(;W[cd]
(;B[lp];W[lq];B[mp]C[[Malweth\]: These moves didn't accomplish much! Your wall is not being put to use...

See variations.];W[kp];B[gj];W[ii]C[[Malweth\]: This is why computers are bad opponents (for review and otherwise). The G9 stone is more important than the G11 stone (for moyo at least) but the computer saves the worthless stone.

Aside from the problems with O14 the top side is fairly solid.]
;B[hk];W[ik];B[hi];W[hl];B[gl];W[ln];B[mn]C[[Malweth\]: Pushing in at G7 prevents moyo better. You're trying to take territory using influence (between Q4 and N4). This goes against proverb (use thickness to attack, don't play near thickness, don't make territory with thickness, etc).]

;W[qi];B[nh];W[kh];B[lf];W[qe];B[ni]C[[Malweth\]: Nearly all of the last ~20 moves have been to take territory. It seems like yose has been entered too early or oyose should be reviewed (if possible... I'm not sure what resources are available).]
