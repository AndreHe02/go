C[Hi!

I'm Attila Mondik, and played black in this game. I won the game by a small margin, but I'm not satified with my play.
Please give me some advices on how can become stronger.
I marked my questions and comments with m:.
Thank you for commenting my game.];B[pd];W[pp];B[dq];W[dd];B[co]
;W[cj]C[Not ideal

White should approach from the other side];B[jq]C[Tking advantage of white's mistake - although maybe O3 would be better]
;W[qj]C[R14 is more usual];B[jc]C[f17 would be better];W[gc]
;B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[pn];B[mc]LB[cc:C][di:A][ei:B]C[m: is it slow?

YES a reducing move at A or B followed by invading at C would be better]
;W[qf];B[rd];W[pj];B[cc]LB[di:A][ei:B]C[Best preceded by A or B 

Fortunately white went the wrong way..

He should have follwed the variation here]

;W[bc];B[eg];W[ej];B[gg];W[dm];B[fm]C[m: bad move. but what should I move insteed?

The moves that followed made this move look worse than it really was.

Having started to attack you then shy away from any fighting and white pushes you around

I have added some variations over the next few moves for you to see how it could develop. 

None of these is necessarily best play - but they don't seem bad for black]
;W[en]
(;B[fn];W[eo]C[Letting white take this point is bad - since this is the vital point for reducing the shimari]

(;B[fp]C[This move looks questionable F3 may be better];W[fo]

(;B[ep]C[Having to drop back like this and let white push through is really passive]
;W[go]C[Letting white push through is really bad!];B[gp];W[ho]

(;B[gj]TR[fm][fn]C[Seein as this doesn't connect or make territory it looks bad.

If you are giving up the triangled stones then just push at H4 and make a bit more territory.

If you want to rescue them - then rescue them 

But its a bit late now];W[gl]C[Letting white capture them like this gives him too much security]
;B[jo]LB[mg:A]C[Having played G10 you should back it up with a move near  A and H4 is better than K5]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[or]LB[qq:A]C[m: endgame move...

Well the endgame has started!

- it is not bad - it leaves black open at the bottom and preents the invasion at A]
;B[nr]C[m: ... but I made it sente. Any better move?

Well letting white slide to M1 would be quite big and sente too.

Actually this is already the endgame since both players have played rather conservatively and there has been no real fighting to speak of.

Black could of course slide to T13 instead but seeing black is ahead here then playing conservatively like this should be OK]
;W[of];B[od];W[re];B[qe];W[pe];B[qd]C[m: now I think this move is not needed]
;W[fi];B[gi];W[fh];B[fg];W[gh];B[hh]
(;W[fl]C[m: small.

Well white is trying to avoid a fight - as both players have been all along]
;B[ij];W[lp]
(;B[lo]C[This is wrong - you play this move when you are weak - here the diagional move is better - see variation]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[ko];B[ln];W[kp];B[nn];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[lr]
C[m: is this a solid move, or a slow one?
 - slow - but you messed up here earlier anyway

Something like O10 looks better];W[om];B[mf];W[ng];B[mg];W[hf]

[hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms]C[Overall both players are far too passive early in the game the extensions when a kakari was possible set the tone from the start..

After a passive middle game there are a few attempts at invasions in what is really the endgame when it is too late to do anything big unless you opponent makes a mistake.

Your biggest weakness is a tendency to try to avoid fighting. You should embrace fighting - right from the start even if you lose a few games as a result - because you will learn a lot more and become stronger.!]
