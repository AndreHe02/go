Dear reviewer,
this was a tournament game I played recently.  I'm White in this game.  I lost by about 5 points after komi.  This game is particularly interesting to me since I completely failed to come up with a plan for the middle game, and because I can't put my finger on any really severe mistakes.
I've added some comments to explain what I was thinking during the game.

Black pushes me along - I have trouble deciding where to stop.

Reviewer: My criteria on stopping of the crawling is depend on whether tenuki is possible or not.]

(;B[pl]C[
With hindsight, maybe I should have crawled once more.

R: Yes, one more crawling would be the best one, and your selection (w18) is the 2nd and the worst selection would be two-streight crawling as shown in branch..]

(;W[jq];B[qh];W[rh];B[qm];W[rf]C[
w22 is good choice
.];B[ed]C[
If own living stones were located in around N17, then you should choose upper Tsuke (E15) , the reason is black's Atsumi is decresed by the presence of the living white stones]

(;W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[gd];W[cf]LB[me:A][nd:B]C[
I was getting concerned about being shut off from the center with a move like Black M15.  I considered playing a one-space jump at A, but didn't like the idea of a black peep at B.
R: I agree to your idea.];B[kc]LB[pd:A][rd:C][qe:B]C[
R:Next white move is so difficult.  
I will choose A move, for two white groups are connected this move. Thereafter 30 move become a good one.]
;W[kd]LB[pd:A]C[
w 30 was a  mistake,  A is a good one like the previous comment.]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[jc]LB[me:A]C[
I misread this - I thought I'd get a nice squeeze, but...
R..next w34 was  mistake as you mentioned.
A would be something better than w34.]
(;W[le];B[md];W[ne];B[nd];W[od]LB[mb:B][nb:A]C[
... I overlooked that if White A, Black B may be possible.  So I compromised.
This damage is very big.
R. Yes, it was  the biggest Y]

At this stage, I didn't know what to play.  Invading either of the two black corners seemed to be more or less miai, but beyond that I entirely failed to come up with a plan.  I don't seem to have territory I can expand, and there aren't any weak black groups to harrass.
R, i don' know the best way, but w48 is not bad.];B[ck]LB[pq:A]
C[
I decided to invade the lower left, but I'm not convinced now that a play at A wouldn't be bigger.
R:If black choose B7, the territory is firm, therefore b49 is bad.]

;W[bs]C[
Ouch.
Reviewer:];B[qo]MA[nq][nr]C[
I'm still suffering from the lack of any kind of plan.  I played this move to strengthen my weak stones a bit and to prevent a black move at M5, but this is probably just aji-keshi :-
R:Black has weak points (XX) , however  black easily gained territory by  w62 move.]

wright w84]
(;W[go]
(;B[fl]C[
Well, at least I've got something to do now - turn the center into dame.]
;W[jh]C[
Sadly this seems to be going in a bit too far.
R.:I think so, because w86 was separeted by b87. therefore,  L12 location was steady.]
;B[kg];W[ci]LB[ch:A]C[
After the game I was wondering if this was possibly the losing move - this white stone got cut off later, so maybe I should have played at A?

R.:Normally w88 is very good choice.  In this situation, A position is better than w86.
 For, black Atsumi in central part is dominant and w 86 is isolated. don't make two  weak stones.]
;B[ei];W[hm];B[il];W[hl];B[hk];W[fe];B[fd]LB[if:A][gh:B]C[
w96 is too heavy move.
A or B is a light move.]
(;W[jg]C[
I think w96 is bad move and b97 is good move.
W86 is located in a strong black field, Therefore, good strategy is not to help the stone, but  to sacrifice it.]
;B[kf];W[fg];B[gi];W[hg]LB[hh:A]C[
In this case, you colud select A instead of w100,  
For, the point of w100 is not cut by black. Also A has pressure to black but w 100 has no pressure to black.]
;B[dg];W[df];B[eg]
(;W[ef]C[
I was worried about my connection to the center stones, but also didn't want C11 to get cut off.
R.Now center stones could not omit.];B[fh];W[jf];B[ke];W[id]
;B[jd]LB[he:A]C[
The last chance was 110 move.
If you select A, then you have winning chance as shown in the branch.]

:-(];W[if];B[cg];W[bg];B[bh];W[bf];B[ch];W[ah];B[ai]C[
After this, we played out the rest of the endgame. I can more or less remember the final result but I'm unable to reproduce the order of moves, so I'll stop here.  I'm sure there's plenty to criticize already.]
;W[ag];B[bi]C[
R.:Black is dominant, though the difference is not big. However,  as black has no weak stones, reversing of the result would be very difficult.]
