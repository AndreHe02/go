;B[eg]C[I don't know if this follows joseki or not, but I was happy with the result.

TU: It is ok but a bit slack
d13 is joseki : it puts more pressure on white];W[pg];B[nd]
;W[nq]
(;B[pj]TR[qn]C[TU: do not forget that Q13 is a light stone for both black and white :
not easy to attack for black but not easy to exploit for white.

Q10 comes too early better defend at R6 and wait
(like a spider on its web)];W[pn]
(;B[oo]LB[np:A]C[Would A have been better? Or something else?

TU: The real mistake was at move 14.

TU: O10 is a very good global move indeed :)];W[ld];B[jf];W[qj]

TU: usual go theory say  "never atari and extend"
the most annoying move for white is R12]

;W[cm]
(;B[cn]LB[fo:A]C[Maybe A instead?

TU: why not E6 ?
the problem with A is that is does not cut
the problem with C6 is the bad shape it gives to black
but is remains globally better than A];W[dm];B[fo];W[cj]C[TU: C10 is a threat to connect with C14]
;B[eq];W[cp];B[bn];W[er];B[fq];W[cr];B[fl]C[TU: wrong direction because of the connection at B12 !]
;W[ej]C[When white played C10 I was surprised and unprepared. Although my group has a good enough shape I felt disapointed at how both his groups, the corner one and the C7 group seemed to have life... What was the mistake?]
;B[gj];W[bh];B[bg];W[cg];B[dh];W[bi]C[B13 a thank-you move...

TU: yes better to tennuki and keep yose]
(;B[lo]C[TU: you choosed to trade  the border vs the center
is it a good trade ?];W[kp];B[ko];W[jp];B[io];W[ki]C[TU: the center is not that big now]
;B[lh]LB[kk:A]C[This seems to be the beginning of a fight that went wrong. Playing at A to protect my big moyo seemed passive so I decided to attack.

TU: such a fight is hard to read to the end but
it remains possible for white to trade his L11 stone for something else.]
