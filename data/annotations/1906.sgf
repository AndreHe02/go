C[I'm just a beginner so I haven't made any comments about  the game. The reason for my 17k rating is a mistake I made  while playing viking4 earlier. I forgot to remove the dead  groups in the end, and the server gave the win to me and  promoted me from 30k to 17k. I'm really sorry about this.

I'm mostly curious about the opening game, when and why I  should have invaded the middle and when my groups (and his)  were considered dead.

I also would like to know where I should go to effectively  split his groups.

Game reviewed June 10, 2002, by Allan Wickberg, probably between 20k-15k, something. Comments are marked "al>", and indicates what I think would be right to do, IMHO.]
;B[dd];W[qc];B[oo];W[cq];B[dl];W[qq];B[je];W[fc]C[al> so far, white plays the way a beginner is often adviced to do; play the first moves no higher than the third line. Black plays what appears to be like a very strong player, going for influence, rather than securing territory. Only, when you look at the finished game, it is hard to tell that it originated from this position - black has nothing in the center.]
;B[ed];W[qo];B[qm];W[hp];B[kp];W[lc];B[nc];W[qg];B[qe];W[re]
;B[pe];W[og]C[al> up until now, I don't think there is too much wrong with black's playing. It is not too heavy anywhere, and it pushes white fairly well, I would say. It is rather bold, though, and you have to be able to cash in later for this to be worthwhile.]

(;B[dh]C[al> This is the first move that I think black is doing wrong. With P13, white is threatening black's group in the upper right, so it would be wise to defend it. B S14 would be a threat to split white, for instance. B S16 would attack the corner. B O14 would be more consistent with how B has been playing so far. Anyhow, the black group need attending.]
;W[jc]C[al> Now, it is even more important to strengthen the black group, since white builds a stronger position to cut it off.]
;B[ep]C[al> splitting is good for attacking stones, but since the corner stone is strong (the corner is secured) B E4 should rather be at F3, I think. That would attack the white stone at H4 harder, and drive it out into the board where black dominates. But the stones in the upper right should still be given priority. There are an awful lot of points there for white, should he kill the black group.]
;W[hd];B[gd]C[al> here, black is pushing white against his own (black's) weaker stones, which does not seem like such a good idea, to me. Otherwise, I kind of like this move. Can't say why, it just appeals to me :)

al> If we keep disregarding the upper right black group, playing something like G3 would be interesting as well.]
;W[gc];B[ec]C[al> B E17 does not feel good. It seem like a bad shape, although the black group is hardly in danger. G15 would be in line with what black has been playing so far. I would also like to take this opportunity to keep nagging about the black upper right group - it is still threatened. "Urgent before big", I think the saying goes.]
;W[pn];B[po]C[al> B R10 would be my knee jerk move here. Then white would have to worry about the stones at 13. First, build a strong base. Then, attack.]
;W[qn];B[pm]C[al> The way black has been playing suggests that he aims for a big chunk of the center. If that is the case,  B Q7 makes it possible for white to throw a tentacle out in the board, destroying points for black. It would be better to play something like O7, to keep white off the center.]
;W[me]C[al> there. now black's group is sealed off, and has to start surviving on it's own.]
;B[ne]C[al> ...and contact playing is the way to go. But I think it would be better to  do S14 or S 16 first - that would be a threat that white has to take seriously, and black will have time to play O15 later.]
;W[qk];B[pi];W[ni];B[pj]C[al> this is too slow for an escape. one space jumps are better, like to Q9.]
;W[nk];B[pk]C[al> IF B had played Q9 before, then there would be time to connect the P5 and L4 groups now. Or playing O7 to prevent white from trying to split them.]
;W[mn]
(;B[nn]C[al> O7 would give more opportunities; to cut off the white stone, or to give the left black group an escape to the center, for instance.]
;W[qd];B[qf]C[al> this move does not accomplish anything. it is the dreaded "empty triangle", and it makes it easier for white to attack the black stones. it was still possible to cut at S14.

al> S11 is an important point for both black and white.];W[rg]
C[al>];B[rf]C[al> the white stones cannot be cut, so this is a waste of stones. S11, or O7, is urgent, to save the Q11 group.]
;W[rd];B[oe]C[al> now black is getting very heavy, and does not create any eye space. O13, N14, N16, or anything would be better as a defense.]
;W[mf]C[al> the black group should be dead now, if white knows what to play.]
;B[sf]C[al> this gives white one more prisoner, unless he fouls up. Black shold be attending the Q11 group instead.]
;W[nm];B[on]C[al> The black Q11 group has already been cut off, so this only adds more black stones in danger. N4 or N5 would be better to strengthen the lower group.

al> by the way, white is way out in the center since a while back, so black has lost much of the dominance of the center.]
;W[mp]C[al> white is pretty good at splitting black's groups.]
;B[mo];W[lo];B[om];W[pp];B[op];W[mm];B[no]C[al> I think black (or white) should play S11. Here, black is adding stones to the group without creating eye space at the same time.]
;W[er];B[lp];W[kg];B[ie]C[al> B N3 would save the bottom group easy, and is worth much more thatn saving the K15 stone.]
;W[df];B[cf]C[al> I would rather try to push the white stone from above instead by playing E14. That would also leave less room for white to come out into the board from the top.]
;W[he];B[ge]C[al> H14 would be better, or possibly J13. Now white is squeezed like toothpaste out into the board, destroying the last remains of potential territory for black there.]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[hf];B[fb]C[al> this is an endgame move, which is very small compared to a loss of the Q11 group. N3 would be in place now. B M6 might be good as well, catching the white M5 stone in a ladder.]
;W[rm];B[ql]C[al> s8 first, to threaten the white stone at S7 and to prevent white from connecting to the R9 stone.]
;W[mq];B[lq]C[al> this is shape to avoid: the "empty triangle" makes agroup that is easy to attack and hard to defend. P2 would be more appropriate, and give the possibility to kill the white stones.]
;W[mr];B[lr]C[al> there was still a chance to play P3. Now, white can connect.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[nr];B[rl];W[gf]C[al> if white had played S11 instead, the black Q11 group would be dead now.]

;B[tt];W[pf];B[of];W[oi]C[al> when you look at this result, it is hard to believe that black started out so strong in the center. when your stones are threatened, it is all too easy to get too involved in local fighting, and loose track of the board as a whole. it is no disaster to lose a few stones, as long as you can gain more elsewhere. now, white was not so strong, otherwise the entire right part of the board would have been white's as well.]
