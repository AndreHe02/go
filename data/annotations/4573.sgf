C[This was a game that i had thought i had in the bag. It resulted in disaster.

I believe there is something wrong with my influential style of play in this game. I appreciate you taking time to help review this game for me. Thanks.

P: Hi, I will be reviewing your game. My name is Peter, and I play as InExtremis on KGS.

General advice:
* Learn about capturing races. You had many opportunities to win this game, but a few slack moves lost you the race each time. The Second Book of Go by Bozulich has a great chapter on this. Also, there are many problems on www.goproblems.com that feature this important concept.
* When you fight, do not forget about seki. Also, do not forget the primary goal of attacking is usually not to kill, but rather to get the other player to live small or connect along unimportant points while you get something better in return.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[oq]C[XCM: 3-5. I would like to hear your opinions and thoughts about this particular move.
----
P: This move emphasizes the lower side and the corner. From the perspective of the right side the stone is on the 5th line and doesn't affect that side much. right side.  Basically, it encourages white to play at r3 or r4. Of course, you might have the chance to make a shimari with r4 yourself. If a strong player uses p3 to confuse you in a 3-stone handicap game, I recommend r5 as a response. It is usually inferior, but it avoids complications.]
;W[dc];B[de];W[dd]C[XCM: Hmm, is this joseki? Was my response OK? What is better?
----
P: Check out the variations on gobase, paying attention to the stone in the lower left corner. This is a fairly unusual joseki.]
;B[ce];W[ee]
(;B[bc]C[P: This lets white get the important point of e14... the corner is too small right now. Eyespace is not an issue yet, there are only ~15 points at stake, and it is more important to develop along the side and into the center. Points like e14 often divide moyos, and both sides should fight to get them if possible.]
;W[ef]C[P: Ouch. Look at how e14 radiates power along the top, left side, and center. Black suddenly looks a little weak.]
;B[ch]C[P: Black almost has to do something like this to prevent being shut in the corner.]
;W[id];B[cn];W[cl]C[XCM: My small knight at C6 got pincered... Would a large knight (C7) be better in this case? Or is there a better move. How can i best continue from this situation?
----
P: White is trying to make things complicated! It seems too early for an invasion, since the lower right is so unsettled. Generally, if you want to avoid a pincer, the large knight's move would be better. But make sure you know the variations when white pincers anyway! Here, you could consider invading the corner at c3, jumping out to e6, and attaching at d8. Taking the corner wouldn't be all bad, since c12 and p3 hamper white's prospects at making a large framework. Jumping out would be interesting as well, since c8 isn't that strong. (c8 would be even weaker, of course, if e14 were black) :)]
;B[en];W[fp];B[dk]C[XCM: Is this reasonable? Obviously i was hoping to kill immediately, but maybe there's a bigger point out there...
----
Almost as good as killing is forcing white to live small. Either result would be a success.]
;W[dl];B[el];W[ck];B[dj];W[cj];B[ci];W[dm];B[dn];W[em];B[fm]
;W[fl];B[ek];W[fn];B[gm];W[eo];B[bj];W[bk];B[bi];W[bo]
(;B[bn];W[bm]
(;B[co]C[P: This move helps white fix his own defects. It is better simply to descend.]
;W[bp]
(;B[cp]C[P: Be careful! White will obviously respond at c3. This means you lose a valuable liberty, and thus the capturing race. You MUST count liberties in capturing races. You MUST maintain your own liberties.]
;W[cq];B[am];W[al];B[an];W[cm]C[XCM: I failed. (T.T). Was there another sequence available or was i doomed to failure?

Anyway, i reasoned that it was still too early to give up. Not even 50 moves yet. But i really screwed up somewhere. Please point out any problems you see if i fail to pop up a question here.
----
See the variations. You actually had white by *2* moves if you had chosen the safest way. Remember to reduce the other guy's liberties, not your own! :)]
;B[gn]C[P: Good! This turn will help you in any center action. This is an extremely important move and should not be saved as a ko threat.]
;W[fo];B[jp]C[XCM: I played this with the intention to limit white in the south-west. Was this a good idea? Is there a better way to play?
----
P: This move builds up your center a bit, which is good. However, you might consider the corner shimari, L17, or a move around Q10 as big points.]
;W[iq];B[jq]C[XCM: I'm not sure if i nobi'd in the right direction. K4 would've given me more influence, i think. Thoughts?
----
P: I think this works well with p3. Also, white's shape will become overconcentrated. J3 was not a good move for white.]
;W[ip];B[io];W[ho];B[hn];W[go];B[ir];W[hq];B[hr];W[gr];B[kc]
TR[di][fl][in][jo][jr]C[XCM: Attacking the north. Reasonable? Better move elsewhere?
----
P: A stronger player than myself once told me that the value of your thickness is cut in HALF by every defect. Here you have d11, e8, h6, k5, and k2 as weak points. While L17 is a huge move, I think you would be best served with a move at k5. White will have far fewer tricks to pull on you if you play the honest move to fix your shape.]
;W[jc];B[kd];W[gq]
(;B[qk]C[XCM: Just build more influence...

Good, but remember the shape defects in your thickness.];W[in]
C[P: Ouch.];B[jo];W[gl];B[hm]
(;W[hl];B[im];W[il];B[jm];W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[pn];W[qn];B[gi]
C[XCM: The Big Race begins here.
----
P: Wouldn't it be nice to have e14 now? :) Also, maybe it would be good to be more subtle... perhaps start with an attachment at J15? (I'm not 100% sure about the exact move, but right now it will be difficult to capture these stones.)]
;W[ii];B[ij]C[XCM: Someone told me: "Kill from afar". I realise that this move is a direct contradiction. Should i have not attached here, or was it reasonable? Where is a better move?
----
P: This move does not work, as you saw in the game. Rather, consider where you want to push white. If you can force white to escape along neutral points, you stand to make a big profit. In other words, maybe k10? Hopefully you can create a giant territory along the right side. That would be just as good as killing white.]
;W[hj];B[jj];W[hi];B[gg];W[fh]C[P: Big mistake. White should play j13 to escape first, then come back and attack black's weaknesses.]
;B[gh];W[di]C[P: More cutting trouble! Again you wish you had e14, not b17.]
;B[ei];W[dh];B[dg];W[eh];B[fi];W[fk];B[ej];W[eg];B[ig]C[XCM: This move... It lets white run out relatively easily, but i'm not sure... K11 or K12 may have been better. What are your thoughts?
----
P: This is the only move. White is weak, and so are you. Lean on white's weakness to escape, then continue the attack from the other side. If you move in *any* other direction, white will play j13. Good instincts here! :)]
;W[ji]C[XCM: See?
----
P: This is a result of all the cutting points (and white still has some aji in the j6 stone).]

Correct, you should have ignored the move. N5 is the vital point for eyes. White would have to kill something to get an eye if you played N5.]
