(;W[bq]CR[cm]TR[fp]C[H : you should cut at F4 instead of playing B3.  Ask yourself what you are defending? Some two points territory? If you want to settle the group, then play C7. But you should cut and fight in this situation.]
;B[dr]C[how's the correct joseki? ^^*

H : see variation for the joseki, but please do not learn that, it's too difficult, and there is no point in learning joseki by heart.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[ci]TR[en][co][eo][cp][bq]C[how to handle this stone? a good move I suppose...

H : wel it's an ok move, since it won't be attacked so easily, but you have a good parade. Black should have attacked your triangle group which has weaknesses. So now is the occasion to strengthen this group, and putting pressure on the black stone at the same time.]
;W[ck]C[H : and this is the right move fot that prupose.];B[cf]

(;W[df]C[?

H : not good. You're strengthening black where you could put pressure on him. See variation]

;B[ic]C[an this one? black neutralizes my influence... :(  How should I have played?

H : blakc does not neutralize your thickness, since he is not alive nor comfortable. You should apply this simple principle : push your opponent towards your thickness]
;W[kc]C[H : so this is the right move, good!];B[fc];W[cc]TR[fc]
[ic]SQ[je]C[H : NO ! Ask yourself what is the point of this move. There is none, except forcing black to play C10, which will damage your lower position.
Black comes out sente of the following sequence, which means you lost a move.
In this position you should attack the triangle stones, by playing the square move for example..]
;B[cj];W[dj];B[bk];W[cl];B[bl];W[cm]C[H : the two last moves are too submissive. Go back to the upper side and attack.]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[gf]C[H : now what is the point in having thickness? Black will most likely be alive easily, because you didn't attack in time.]

(;W[gg]TR[ge]C[H : don't be shy, cross-cut at triangle. See variation for a possible follow-up]
;B[hf];W[je]C[H : good move, but a bit late, as said earlier]
;B[jd];W[kd];B[ie];W[jf];B[hg];W[gh];B[pj]LB[hq:C][kq:A][nq:B]
C[black is leading - what did I do wrong? Where to start now?

H : I guess I already answered the first question. but mainly, your thickness is of no use now, which is s bad.

Now where should you play... Maybe at A, since you'll be able to make a base on either side of this stones by extending at B or C. Then, you'll have to invade.]
;W[nq]SQ[fo][dp][ep][cq][dr]C[H : black will pincer and have a neat extension from suqare stones]
;B[lq]C[H : here it comes]
(;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo]SQ[pd][qf][pj][fo][dp]
[ep][cq][dr]C[H : look at the result. You played joseki, but it's BAD ! Black has made influence in front of other influence (squares). Now you get a little corner, and he seems to get the whole board. As a bonus you thickness on the left is even more useless.

DO NOT play joseki just because it's joseki. Here the situation demanded to get out in the center. See variation before.]
;W[fn]LB[hp:A]C[H : this move has no point. You make nothing, black gets 5th line territory by playing G5, and you remove a possibility to invade/reduce somewhere around A. This is a "thank you move"]
;B[go];W[of]CR[pd][qf][pj]LB[qc:1][ph:A]TR[md][nd][le][me][ne]
SQ[qg][rg][sg][qh][rh][sh][qi][ri][si]C[to far away...

H : The problem is not being too far or not. The problem is that you won't get any territory here. Let's count. Let's say you win the triangle points 'and I'm being generous), it's 5 points. If black answers simply at A, he gets the square points, plus he secures the circle stones, AND makes it difficult for you to go on the right side area just below that. Yes, this simple move does it all.
It's better to play at 1,event just for a matter of points, but it also threatens the circle stones]

;B[ne];W[mf];B[nf];W[mg];B[ng];W[mi];B[nh];W[mh];B[nk]LB[hg:A]
C[H : now look at the nice 6th (6th !!) line territory black has made. And it's now impossible to invade on the right. Very bad result. And you "thickness" serves no purpose, black already has its head (A) in your "center territory" and he is safe...]
;W[rc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rd];W[hd];B[id];W[ih];B[eb];W[bc];B[ee]
;W[ef];B[hh];W[hi];B[ii];W[jh];B[ij];W[gn]SQ[ii][ij]C[H : again, 5th line territory for black. I understand the two square stones look yummy, but they are worth peanuts compared to the lower side territory.]
;B[ho]C[H : at this point, the game is already lost by quite far. Black has a solid 40 points lead by my count. Even if white captures the center, black will make more points on the lower side anyway.
It's what happens, black even strengthens his lead afterwards. There are a few comments left to read, though.]

;W[kj];B[ki];W[ji];B[li]C[H : now you have to understand this :

Look at the situation. You captured the center territory, which is about 35 points. But at what cost ! Black has 35 points on the lower side, and consolidated his right side in the process...
Just watch the board and compare the size of your center compared to black's right side + lower side...

please remember that : 

- the equilibrium is : territory on third line, influence on fourth line. NOT influence on fifth or sixth line !
- there is no territory in the center. or not much.territory is in the corners,  then on the sides.

Now, you managed to come back a bit in the game afterwards. I don't have much comment for the last moves.]

Thank you very much for your review!!! ^__^

(kaktus 16k)


H : I guess the main mistakes were already spoken of but here goes : 

- when you make thickness, use it to attack. You do not use thickness to make territory.
- be less submissive. That is... start not answering your opponent's moves if you feel there is a bigger move elsewhere.
- In this game you got way too focused on making center territory, which was quite small in the end, regarding the number of stones put there.

I hope this review will be of use. e-mail me if you have questions.]
