C[Hello, and thanks for reviewing my game. I played black so please only focus on blacks (my) moves.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dq]
(;B[de]C[it is unreallistic to not conceder whites moves as they are what prompts your moves.
this move seems to me high as both of whites stone are high. for me it would feel better at c15]

(;W[dh];B[fe]C[here with your stone high and again white playing high it is better to do an approach move at c13  which gives you better shape to make an eye on the edge then you can push against the white stone 
at d16]
(;W[fc];B[he]C[this is a very slow move, better is the shoulder hit at e13]
;W[hc];B[jp]C[I think I should have pincered the white stone around   (d, 10). What do you think?
your really need to settle your three stones first with a move toward the edge to get one eye in which to make a dragon tail in which to whip the white stones and once you have one eye it is much, much 
easier to make the second eye later. this feels very unblanced, not good. there is no power in your stones.]
;W[cf];B[co]C[here you still neglect your three stones, here a black stone at either c15 or c16 is called for]
;W[cm];B[fp]C[I think my opponent could have taken advantage of this in so many ways.
goes without saying];W[dk];B[dp];W[hq];B[hp];W[je]C[I wonder why my opponent played else where and didn't make a base for his stones. 
ask him, but he will not be able to tell you];B[hg]C[this move should be at  j16 but without at least one eye it is not that good, but again a stone at c15 first which end with an eye for black then a around h13]
;W[cq];B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[dr];B[bp]C[Do you thik that i was only able to kill this group because my opponent misread?
you nor your opponent can read at this level, what you should be doing is counting
counting is by far the most important aspect of the game, as it will let you know if you have to fight or not, and if you do have to fight, it means you are behind and will have to start a ko fight]
;W[ce];B[pj];W[nd]C[this was whites loosing move, because a white stone at j12  all but captures the four black stones]
;B[ld]C[Was this a good pincer? (any move is good only if it works)  I don't think so because my pincered stone could become severly attacked.
what can i say.  at this point baring you dropping dead are so far ahead, ie. the three stones different between your opponent (one stone is about 13 stones difference) so that would be 39 points you 
where ahead befor a stone was placed on the board.];W[qh];B[qf]
;W[me]C[see what I mean.  A wasted move.
then why did you play r14?????];B[oh]C[i will tell you why you did not , YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIGHT so you play moves that do not cause a fight]

(;W[lq]C[i have to comment here, white can live in the corner with a ko fight or capture the five black stones in the center and at this time in the game white is way, way behind so he must play ko, and thanks to the GO GODS, he has way more ko threats than black does so he should win the ko fight.]
;B[oq];W[jr];B[iq];W[nr]C[Why didn't white cut at (H,5)
because to cut at h5 is no good, he cuts and you connect all over, still looses the stones]

;W[di];B[eh];W[os];B[nq];W[ps];B[ns];W[eg]C[here there is no ko threat to you, just take the n1 stone, the stones around white 143 are safe and cannot be taken]

;B[tt];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[The game is over and I won by 15.5 points.  Please tell me what I need to work on and what to study.  Also, based on this game you witnessed, what would you consider my rank to be.  Please be honest 
because I don't know.  Again, thak you for the review!!!
only a solid shodan player whom has played in over the board rated tournaments would be able to tell what rank you are and then only a pro would be whom i would ask to see what rank i am.
learn to count, learn to count, learn to count, and then do it all again.
all one needs is half a point to win, you stared this game with +39 points and lost 19 of them, what do you think. also you can capture the three stones at h and j  with a black stone at k2
why are you playing even with someone whom is three stones weaker?????????????????]
