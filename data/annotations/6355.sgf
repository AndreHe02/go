C[Please comment for both sides.

Let me know where I got the wrong direction of the moves and which were the game loosing moves.]
;B[qe];W[dp];B[dd];W[fc]LB[kc:A][pc:B][pp:C]C[Usually it is not normal too approach this corner. 4,4 points are not as urgent as empty corners or other corner moves.
I would expect move 4 to be in one of the marked areas.]
(;B[ic]LB[jc:A]C[I like the idea here but I would make the pincer one longer at A. See var]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[de];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[cf]C[J17 slightly off now. Not really bad its just neither one thing nor the other. Not a severe pincer so F17 is almost dead and not a proper extension.]
;B[eg]LB[pc:A][pp:B]C[This move is a nice move to get if he answers but its probably not quite big enough yet. A or B are probably bigger.
Also, this makes J17 seem even closer to the wall.];W[pp];B[qn]
;W[np];B[pj];W[oc]LB[lc:D][mc:A][qc:C][oe:B]C[Move 21 has some problems finding the best move.

Black A or D will force white B.
Black C will force white A or B.
Black B will force white D.

I wanted to keep pressure on white as well as develop influence in the centre.

This is a nice idea by white. If he approached at Q17 it would be easy for you to find the best move so this shows good awareness of whole board.

If I am playing here I think the only choice is C. Its a hell of a lot of points and you are bound to develop a large right side next. See vars.

Also, I tihnk your D and A actually force white C. Look how many stones you have here. For white to get a whole corner that quikly cannot be too bad for him. Its points in your area of the board and it can't be netted in cleanly.

Maybe B is playable as well. I think you are probably correct when you say B forces D as if we go B,C then O17 will be severe. So, the likely order is B,D,C which seems nice for black.]

(;B[nd]C[There is a proverb. Don't contact weak stones. I think it applies here. This move tries to do too much. The moyo is not impressive enough for a move like this yet.]
;W[nc];B[md];W[qc]LB[lc:C][pe:A][nj:D][om:B]C[w settles quite easily. w should be happy here i think. There are weaknesses at A. C is still available and big and B (or even D) can reduce the moyo well.]

(;B[qd]C[Seening the came now N17 is better.

I was afraid of Q15 by which white could break out.
Now think B Q16, W P16,  B P15, W Q15, white R16 will stop white.

Or another, better idea for black ?

I agree this move is a bit odd. It seems to just be trying to patch up earlier mistakes. I am not sure if N17 is better. See var.

If you want to patch this up and get sente. I think the only move is to peep Q16. But it is painful to make the white stones this strong. See var]
;W[mc]C[This is big but I don't think its a good move. Leaving the hane at S17 is a mistake to me. The corner is so big!]
;B[ld];W[cm]LB[rc:C][ql:D][om:B][jq:A]C[Big but maybe not urgent. I would S17.

Also I am not sure it is even the biggest tenuki. All the marked moves seems more interesting to me. But i think C is necessary. Notice it not only takes the corner but undermines the right side as well. It is huge!]

(;B[fq]C[It seems like you are following your opponent too much. S17 is still the biggest I think. See vars for other alternatives.]

(;W[dq]C[I think this is wrong direction. W should pincer. See var]
;B[lq]C[Nice. I like this move. Use whites weakness to make your own group stronger. Its good.]
;W[lp]
(;B[mq]C[I am not sure about this move. I would prefer to hane. See var.]
;W[nq];B[kp];W[lo];B[iq]C[Again questionable move, better at K3 ?

I think this is fine. K3 probably ok as well. Seems like a matter of perference to me, not a major issue]

(;W[nn]C[This defence is a bit passive. Better at P7 I think.]

(;B[om]C[I am having a problem now, need to defend an invasion at R8, but what is the bst move to do so ??
29 looks a bit awkward.

Yes this does look awkward. I think it is maybe just asking for too much. This maybe gains you a couple more "points" that R8 but leave many more weaknesses. Not worth it.

See vars];W[ro]C[White does get a lot of points in the corner now and opens up the right side.

See previous vars for ways to avoid this.];B[ml]C[thought defending at S6 was too passive. but are there better moves as an alternative ?

S6 would be much too passive. Impossible to play it.

Still S17 is the best move to me :-)

Other than that this seems good.];W[hq]
(;B[hr];W[ir]C[This is a nice move. It is hard to deal with. Maybe H2 can be better at H4 see vars.]
;B[gq];W[jq]
(;B[ip];W[jp];B[jr];W[io];B[hp]C[Is J2 better since this links the 2 groups together ?
I preferred to have a living group get out with sente.
L2 is goto for white so I thought at a later stage I might have a change to play L2 myself first.]

(;W[ko]C[So this is bad and lets L2 be a 50-50 move for each player. see var]
;B[rc]C[Good =)];W[qb]
(;B[cg]C[My oppent thought this was the loosing move, first M17 since this is a move white can hardly ignore.

I was afraid of B M17, white D12 etc.
Counted white to have app. 75 points. Thought black would not be able to get enough points in the centre.
Also the question was who plays L2 first will have a shift of app 20 points.

I agree that M17 is a must. This is why S17 is so huge. I wouldn' call it a losing move but it certainly loses something.]
;W[bf];B[jk]C[Again, better at M17 ?

yes];W[kc];B[kd];W[jc];B[id]C[Settling like this in sente is huge for w. Double sente as this was is always the biggest thing on the board.]
;W[rm];B[qo];W[qp];B[rn];W[sn];B[rp];W[so];B[qm];W[rl];B[qk]
;W[rq];B[rk];W[hi]
(;B[gj]C[Another questionalbe move. Better K11 to seal off the  centre ??

I think so. Of course you need to count first and make sure you have enough. But K11 does seem like the right move]

;W[hl];B[hm];W[im];B[jl];W[gk];B[gm];W[od];B[oe];W[jd]
(;B[kf]C[Again a questionable move since this gives white to link up. I was afraid white could break trough, but is this really possible ??
Better K15 (with later the change to play J18 with sente, and black can still keep some pressure on the wite centre group) and start the fight ?

Yes must always block. Letting w run through is a disaster.]
;W[ie];B[fd]LB[df:B][dl:A]C[I am now loosing the control over the game.

L14 was a scared move. It is indeed getting hard now. This group went from totally secure to not so and this makes the game hard. Now things like A and B which you would have called miai to reduce the left side are questionable as B may become sente.]
;W[dg];B[df];W[dh];B[eh];W[ei]C[I think there is a bit of a tesuji here. See var]

(;B[fi];W[ej];B[dl];W[cl];B[di];W[ch]C[Now there really is a tesuji ;-)]

(;B[dk];W[fh];B[fg];W[fj];B[dm];W[dn];B[en];W[eo];B[ck]C[Aigan, not good, better F6 to link and have C9 still there as an endgame move.

I actually like your sequence here. I think it is a loss for white when you make life although there is one move I would change see var]

;W[co];B[bl];W[gd]
(;B[he];W[fe];B[gc];W[bn];B[hb];W[bj]C[Black looses about 30 points on thhe left.

This is about the end of the game. The loss is too big. The ko was a flower ko for white]

;B[ar];W[aq];B[es];W[sl];B[as]C[So its a good game. Getting S17 put you ahead but not following with M17 gave w a chance again.

The move at L14 puts w ahead as the strength of groups changed and this is a HUGE problem.

The life on the left side was very good and brought the game back to you but the ko was just not quite possible, after that w has enough I think.

Hope this helps to somewhat... if you have any more questions i am aitkensam on KGS. YOu can call me there.

Happy New Year.

So w has 15 at A

                  10 at C
                  10 at D
                  + komi
                  + a bit on the left side. hard to say how much yet.

=56.5 + left side

And b has 5 at 1
                   10 at 2
                   55+ at 3

=70+

So if you can keep the left side to a minimum I think you can win.
