C[Hello, Vyacheslav!

I am Bernd, HonFu in GTL and on KGS where you can find me playing, chatting or reviewing all the time.

There are times where we do everything correctly and still don't improve. Then there are other times where we make a serious mistake, and we make it again and again. The 2nd case is easier and more pleasant, because as soon as we get rid of that one mistake, we will already play a lot better!

I have found some of those "blind spots" in your understanding. I am sure you will clap your head and say "Oh, of course!" And then you will become 4k very soon! ^_Â°]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp]
(;W[pc]C[This move is dubious.]
(;B[jp]LB[pe:A][jp:B]C[Since A is so large, B seems a bit off topic.]
;W[qj]LB[qe:A]C[Experimental style. Solid approach would be A. Settling the corner is very large!]
;B[dj];W[fq]LB[jd:A]C[I can see why you felt forced to play here. But A is so large ... you get komi, so maybe it is okay if you both build moyos.]
;B[dq]
(;W[iq]C[This move is a mistake.]
(;B[jq];W[ip];B[io];W[ho];B[hn];W[go];B[in];W[cm]C[Overplay. you already have a weakish group on the lower side, don't start another one.]
;B[dn]LB[em:A]C[Maybe he should have played A instead. But I'm not sure about this.]
;W[eo];B[do];W[fm];B[dm];W[dl]
(;B[cl];W[ck];B[bl];W[dk];B[bm];W[bk]LB[dd:A][dj:B]C[This worked out great for you. Lower side got a helping hand, and the wall works great with A. The stone at B, in an important place before, is now a "bubblegum" stone, as I like to call them, sticking useless at your wall.]
;B[oq]C[Black is playing too slow. If he likes territory so much, he should have played a shimari opening.]

(;W[qn]C[Too small now.];B[qp]C[Supersmall.];W[on]LB[jd:A]C[Now you profit on his being too careful. But A is larger. Your move mostly works, because he answers it.]
;B[no]C[Sente. Thanks, black! :)]
(;W[qe]LB[jd:A]C[I still prefer A, because it also develops the left side.]
;B[fc]LB[jc:A]C[He should have taken A.]
(;W[fd]C[No! Make the most of your potential! Don't help him live easily and reduce your influence!]
;B[ec];W[ed];B[dc];W[cd];B[cc];W[fj]C[Upper side was bigger, as shown in the variations.]
;B[ej];W[fk];B[eh];W[fi];B[fg]LB[dg:A]C[A was the shape move.]
;W[ei];B[di]C[Now we get to the blind spots I was talking about in the introduction.]

(;W[dg]C[No!];B[dh]C[Now he has connected his stones.]
(;W[eg]C[No!];B[fh]C[You helped him to connect and to find a safe way out into the center. The opposite of what you should have done!]

(;W[gd]C[Maybe you can try for more.];B[gc];W[hd];B[ic]
(;W[hg]LB[hh:A]C[This helps him get out. A was still better, since your wall up there is in place. Press your opponent's weak stones against your walls!]
;B[hh]
(;W[gg]C[This only helps black to do what he wanted to do anyway!]
;B[gh];W[ff];B[ig];W[hf]C[The empty triangle. You should be attacking, but instead he forces you into bad shape.]
;B[ij]C[You only helped him to come out.]
(;W[mc]C[Solid, but slow.];B[qi];W[pj];B[pi];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni]
;B[pg];W[of]LB[mg:B][ng:A]C[I'd rather like to surround him at A or B. Surrounding is the most basic attack in go, try to surround a weak group whenever you can! Instead you're holding him the door open.]
;B[ng]C[Out in the center he is.];W[hc]C[This move does not improve your position. It is ajikeshi - destruction of your own potential.]
;B[hb];W[li];B[nf];W[oe];B[qg];W[rj];B[nn]
(;W[nm]C[Weren't you planning to kill him?]
(;B[mm];W[lg];B[lf]
(;W[me]C[Instead again you help him connect.];B[mf]C[This is the end of the review.

The direction of play and the size of moves explained in the opening stage will be easily comprehendable as soon as you see them on the board.

The bigger problem is your attacking technique. Attacking means to cut your opponent, and to surround him. If possible, you kill him, if not possible you at least contain him, forcing him to live small, taking influence for yourself.

In this game you often did the exact opposite: Instead of cutting him you helped him connect, and instead of surrounding him you simply helped him find the way out.

If you want to learn more about the correct way of attacking, get yourself the book "The ABC's of Attack and Defence" by Michael Redmond, 9p. It is a marvellous book, and after you have studied it thoroughly, you will have grasped how to cut and surround properly.]
