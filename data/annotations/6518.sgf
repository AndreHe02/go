C[Black seems to be working from behind after the exchange in the upper right corner. My opening moves seem to have gotten me in trouble again.

The big problem here is Black's large territory on the right side. You force him to make and build it. At first, your upper right corner gives you some compensation, but later when you force him to expand it, you get very little in return. It would be different if your plays were on the division between his terrtory and yours.]

LB[dd:A]C[is Q8 a better option for white 10?

No, this move works well with your stone at A and it keeps b from expanding his right side territory along the top.]
;B[pf];W[qc];B[mc]LB[rc:A]C[
This is not the joseki move for b. He is supposed to play at A. So, A is probably a good reponse for w.]

(;W[pc]C[is Q16  more reasonable?

Either that or S17. I think that the game move is solid, but maybe over cautious]
;B[jc];W[qe]LB[pc:A][rc:B]C[
This move and the sequence that follows seems to prove that the move at A was not the best. W feels a need to do something here., because a black move at B would leave his position a little small. However I don't really like the results of the exchange.]
;B[qf];W[re];B[rf];W[pe];B[fc]C[
B gets sente to make this move. W gets a big corner, but b gets a more secure right side and a good claim on the top at the end of the exchange.]
;W[cf];B[on];W[of];B[og];W[nf];B[ng];W[mf];B[ld];W[mg];B[mh]
LB[nj:A][mj:B]C[
The preceeding exchange is forcing b to build his strong right side toward the center., while w is not really getting any kind of territory or real influence in exchange.  A w move at A or B would maybe hold black down better. These moves are out of the question now, but might have been something to aim at before this exchange.
I going to guess that maybe you meant this as a leaning attack against b's stones at the top. If that is the case, he sees it in time. His position is a little too secure to fall victim to such an attack.]

I was really unsure about A and B, but I like this move a lot!]

C[
This is a very effective cap. If not for it, w would have a huge moyo.]

LB[bo:A]C[
This move is very destructive to your position. I offer another response that I think might work. at A]

(;W[dm];B[cn]
(;W[dn];B[bo];W[cl];B[bp];W[ba]C[losing the corner seems like a big loss for black

Yes it is, but b's plays expanding his lower left give him quite a bit of compensation.]
;B[kr];W[hm]LB[hp:A][mr:B][ha:C][gg:D]C[
This does not seem like a big move to me. A-D seem bigger.
Well maybe this is all part of your plan to cut off b's center, but at this point it seems unlikely.]
;B[hp];W[bl];B[fl]
(;W[fm]C[
I am trying to decide if you really have to answer b to protect your stones. I don't  really think so and there is no other contested territory here.]
;B[gl];W[hn]LB[hl:A]C[
A is better if you are going to play here.];B[lq];W[ha];B[ib]

;W[jf];B[ke];W[kf]C[
Not sure what you are aiming at here. This move doesn't really threaten b and it gets you no territory.
OK, I see that you are trying to cut off b's center. Even at this point it seems unlikely to succeed, but you have to try something.]

C[White's attack is probably premature.

Oh, I see now. Yes, but a nice bold try when you are behind.]
