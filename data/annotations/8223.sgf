Mr0661: Idea of overplay is something that is hard to grasp for many. Punishing from overplay, even though one who overplays might make claim of hundred points, maybe correct answer is only 2 points better than if opponent hadn't ovet played. Only thing you need to do in Go is to win. If you win by 1 point it is same as to win with 50 points. 

Same is in punishing. When best punishment-sequence gives you slighlty better result than to you opponent, and the game continues, and you still havent won, it is ok. Don't try to ovetplay your way to victory when you opponent overplays.

Remember, that every overplay, is just bad play, and it is punished same way as any other bad play, by playing correct move.

In middle game, when you attack, remember you have no need to kill. Killling stones in Go is very difficult. Try to get enough for win, protect from invasion, or make one possible, and kill if your opponent don't allow you your rights to protect or invade.

For study, I would suggest to count points in game, and trying to make guesses who is leading and how much. Then try to win.]

-
Mr0661: there is many choices, I don't see anything wrong with this]
;B[ee];W[fd];B[bc];W[dk]C[SaurusDNA: I was rather surprised by b17 - I don't think it's a standard move, and I wasn't sure how to reply. I think d9 is consistent with playing d12 high, with the idea of building a moyo.
-
Mr0661: No for moyo, but for stability of your white stones.]
;B[bh]
(;W[po]C[SaurusDNA: I wanted to play f15 now, but the bottom seemed very important to both players, and I didn't want my opponent to make an ideal shimari from q3, especially since all three of my stones on the left are invested towards controlling the bottom.
-
Mr0661: It wouldn't be ideal simari if you also made your own.]

;W[hn]
(;B[ho];W[gq]C[SaurusDNA: This seemed important, as the corner has no influence, and therefore must become territory.

Mr0661:Hard to say, many possibilities, lower left corners points are hard to say, how much white can get points in centre without letting black advance his own big areas. Will this give possibility to black to make invasion into right side
X stone is attackable spot.]
(;B[df]C[Mr0661: This is quite small move];W[jg]C[SaurusDNA: This is a move where I particularly would like advice.

K13 seems very optimistic, since killing is essential. However, considering my thickness, h12 just seems horribly passive, and I know it's wrong to make territory from thickness.

What should my overall strategy have been in this position, and what was the best move locally?
-
Mr0661: One shouldnät use thickness to make area, instead, to use strength to attack. One attacks not to kill, but to wound. You could use black moive to chace that stone so, that you could get some big endgames in sente, maybe even some area in centre at some point]

;B[jf];W[kg];B[if];W[hh];B[ji];W[je]C[SaurusDNA: How to save the L13 stones? I couldn't see a way, so I left them alone for a while, but I think this was a mistake, as they are my most important cutting stones on the board. I think it was probably my failure to look after those two stones that cost me the game. What is a good continuation from those two stones?]
