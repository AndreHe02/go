C[White beat me pretty solidly this game (17 points), and I'm not entirely sure where it went wrong.  I felt good about the opening, but I felt the like game was more or less lost by the time we got to the middle game..]
;B[pd]C[
 strombrg 8k*: Have a good game];W[cp];B[dd];W[pq]C[I have trouble playing against this opening in particular.  My usual strategy is to block the direction of expansion from one enclosure, then play against the other enclosure.]
;B[cj];W[eq];B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pn];W[nq];B[pj]C[I was feeling good about the opening so far, but.. maybe Q10 was a little overconcentrated on the right side, in retrospect.  Maybe I should have played at K16 or K17?

sita: I think it is ok so far. Q10 seems to be necessary. It is not overconcentrated, but nice shape.]
;W[kc]
(;B[mc]C[I approached from this side to avoid white extending to O17, which I felt would cramp my corner a bit.

sita: I definitley recomment the other approach. See variation.]
;W[hc];B[fc];W[qh]C[I was unsure about how to deal with this.  I wanted to play at R10, but I also wanted to force the R12 stone into the center so I could attack it and the group on the upper side.  It seemed like an exchange like R10-S15-S16-P13 would be better for white.]
;B[qe]TR[qh]C[sita: I like this move. It is solid, you have profit in the corner and w's marked stone looks quite lonley and without base.]
;W[pl];B[ql]LB[rj:A]TR[pl][qh]C[sita: I recomment A instead. After that w's two marked stones are seperated. With these weak stones on the board, the oncomming fight cannot be in favour of w.]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[qk];B[ol];W[rl];B[pk];W[qj];B[nn]TR[eq][nq]C[Now I'm feeling less good about the opening.  I tried to make the most of the wall I got here, but it didn't seem to be pointing in a very good direction..

sita: Indeed. W is low at the lower edge, so you cannot use the wall to fight there, because there is nothing to fight for. You cannot fight elsewhere or make territory with the wall either.]
;W[rn];B[ej];W[bd]C[I had no idea how to deal with this.  I was tempted to turn it into a kite joseki by playing C17 and expecting C14, but I still wanted to attack the upper-side group and that exchange would have left me trying to attack from a very small base..]
;B[cg]TR[ej]LB[ce:A]C[sita: The idea of this move seems to be ok. After you played the marked stone, you have to stress the left side. Nevertheless, I would put some more pressure on the invading stone by playing A.]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[bb];B[db];W[ac];B[ba]C[Thought I had something, but I was mistaken..]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[cf];B[df];W[cd];B[de];W[ce]C[sita: This group lives even without the last move.]
;B[ge]LB[ke:A]C[sita: Wrong idea. You are very strong there, so you have so attack the upper w group from the other side. Maybe starting with A.]
;W[ke];B[me];W[lb];B[mb]C[I think this was a profitable exchange for me, but white's next move is too big..]
;W[ip]LB[jb:A][kq:B][cn:C]C[Now I'm really feeling uncomfortable about the game.  On the one hand, trying to reduce the lower side earlier would probably kill the prospects of my right-side wall, but now I'm way behind on territory.  Can I reduce the lower side, or is it to late?  When should I have gone in there?

sita: Yes, It is not very comfortable. But on the other hand, it is not that bad. The upper group has a weak point at A to expoit later.

And then, as mentioned earlier, there were never territory prospects for the right wall. Its only purpose could be to fight somewhere. So, you should be happy to invade e.g. at B and have something to back up the fight. Proabably you can get sente there and take the last very large point at C.]
;B[mp]C[sita: Too timid. Don't make territory with your walls, use them for fighting.]
;W[mq];B[lp];W[kq];B[lq];W[lr];B[kr];W[jr];B[kp];W[jq]C[..best I could think of.]
;B[cn]C[sita: Very good. A really big point. Both of you could make territory there.]
;W[eo];B[em];W[in];B[km];W[pi];B[jd];W[jc];B[hd]C[Hoping to expand my left-center territory soon..

sita: See comment at move #75.];W[kd];B[ic];W[ib];B[id]TR[hd]
[id][jd][ic][ke]C[sita: Have a second look at it. Do you think, your marked stones would help your center territory, considering that w's marked stone is part of a strong group? I say: no. The right strategy would be, to take away the base from w's group and make territory by attacking it. That is, a good idea would have been not to start with k16, but e.g. K18.]

;W[if];B[hf]TR[hd][id][jd][ic]C[sita: Consider the position without the marked stones. Would your territory be bigger?]
;W[kh];B[ji]LB[bo:A]C[sita: How many points do you get by answering there? 2, or 3? How about ignoring w's move and playing the double sente at A?]

sita: Yes, but anyway: you captured one stone and b made something like four points territory.]
;W[li];B[kh];W[je];B[le];W[mf]C[I felt like I should have been able to kill the upper-side group now, but I didn't choose the right point to attack.. maybe J19 followed by L19?

sita: I hope my comments to deal with such openings strategicaly will help a bit. In short: Don't think so much about territory in the beginning. Think of strong and weak groups, think of fighting. Look at the 13 points you made with your right side wall. Forget about half of them and kill therefore 15 points at the bottom.]
