C[jest: hi
seannethmm: hello];B[pp]C[In this game I played against another 22k on IGS. I was white, he was black. This game ended up in white resigning, mainly because black gained too much of an advantage in the opening for white to recover. With that in mind, I have a couple of questions.

1)How could white have played the opening better?
2) Black had gained a lot of territory on the 4th line, but every invasion white made seemed to only strengthen black. How could white have done these invasions better?

Even though I realized I had lost early on, I kept playing, hoping to learn from this game.

Baga: Hello, Im currently 9-10kyu on KGS. Enjoy the review!]
;W[dd]C[Baga: You are the first 22kyu Ive seen who isnt obsessed with "buzzwords" like joseki. Instead you use the english equivalent "opening". This shows you are more interested in substance than style. Bravo!]
;B[pc]C[Baga: This move by black is dangerous because it allows him to enclose a corner. Very Dangerous.]

(;W[dp]
(;B[cn];W[ck]C[I thought that this move would help me secure some territory on the left hand side, as well as endanger black's stone a bit. However, I really had no idea how to proceed and got myself into trouble.]
;B[dm]
(;W[dk];B[qe];W[nq]C[I am pretty sure this was not a good move, but I thought that pressuring black's corner a bit could help me disrupt some of his territory later.

Baga: It was OK. But the D4 stone should have been a priority. Shore up your defenses before going on the attack!]
;B[fc];W[ec]C[Probably too slow, but I wanted a move that shut black out of the corner and possibly giving me future invasion possiblilities.]
;B[fd];W[dg]C[I thought this move would secure a large bit of territory, but it ended up being too slow. Would a play at or around Q10 been better? or should I have tried to strengthen my stone at D4?

Baga: This move was OK. You corrected a weakness with your D9 formation.]
;B[fq]C[I never realized how weak my D4 stone was before black played this move.]
;W[cq]C[Would F4 have been better?

Baga: To be honest, even at my level...Im not sure...];B[bp]

(;W[np];B[nr];W[mr];B[os];W[kc]C[On reflection, this invasion seemed to be a poor strategy, as it gave black far too much influence in the upper right.

Baga: It was not a bad move considering the circumstances. Notice how the Q17/R15 enclosure is so powerful now (which is why I drew your attention to it in the beginning).]

(;W[ma]C[Baga: Seems like a low gain move. You can still try cutting off his F17 formation.]
;B[oc];W[kb];B[id];W[nn]C[I needed to break out into the center somehow, as I was getting shut in. This was probably a poor way to do it though.

Baga: Nope you didnt really need to break out. You are the weaker party in that region, but you are undisputably ALIVE. Your main concern would be to prevent black from enclosing the area that was earlier marked with Squares]

(;B[pl];W[ql];B[rk];W[rl];B[rj];W[pk]C[My group was in danger, and so I began to try and break loose so I could connect.]

Baga: You have overwhelming superiority in the region. Black is being unreasonable.]
;W[dj];B[fi]
(;W[fj]C[Baga: Notice that what you are doing here is trying to mess up the formation. That is a strategy that may pay off when its all or nothing, when you are breaking a moyo, or keeping a unstable group of yours alive, BUT, when you are overwhelmingly superior as here, its pointless.]

Baga: See variations. As you can tell the chances that you will live are small. But if you tried those variations (which ended in failure if black responded correctly) you can hope black makes a mistake (which is very possible).]

Hopefully you learned something from the fight.. and this review.
