C[Hello, i reviewed a half of the game by myself, so it should be very good to understand the meaning of my moves and some correct variations.
The mostly I want to know is fuseki and how to attack weak groups and, of course, my mistakes.
Thank You.

Your game is a very complicated one. I have tried to analyze it the best I can, but there are still some question marks left. 
On the other hand, in some places I can give some general advice which is not so much open to doubt. The main area where both you and your opponent must improve is in calculating (or, in a fast game, estimating) the status of your groups. (jantje)]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[oq];B[qq]LB[po:b][pp:a]C[Where is the best answer in this position?

Your move (a, Q4) is OK, though b (Q5) is more common. (jantje)]
;W[pp];B[qp]LB[qo:a]C[Here White can (and probably should) hane at a.]
(;W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[qm];W[jq]C[This seems to be a reasonable result for both. (jantje)]
;B[gq]C[I think its bad from Black, so I tenukied

Black's move is not bad at all, but it carries no direct threat. So tenuki is OK. (jantje)]
;W[de]LB[ce:A]C[Maybe A might be better

That question is too hard for me, I wouldn't worry about it if I were you (jantje)]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[df];B[fd]LB[fc:a]C[Joseki is a, for a reason that we will shortly see.]
;W[dj]LB[cj:a][cl:b]C[Maybe "A" is better?

A (C10) aims at immediate stabilization. To judge your move, you must ask yourself whether you have a good answer to Black b which obviously threatens an invasion.]
(;B[cn];W[hc]LB[jc:B][fd:A]C[Thought "A" was played to play after this B or something, I played here.
Maybe there is better variations?

I like your move very much, it shows that A is in the wrong position (jantje)]
(;B[fc]C[I think this is very slow

True, but what else should he do? (jantje)];W[kc]TR[hc]LB[mc:a]
C[Settling group

Another way of thinking is that H17 is a forcing stone that you need not hold on to at any price. Therefore a (N17) might be just as good as your move (jantje)]
;B[nc];W[oc]LB[qf:A]C[I think now that this is bad, maybe I should not be very agressive and play around "A"?

I think your move is alright, Black played in a crowded area to begin with and you should make him feel it. (jantje)]
;B[nd];W[pf];B[nf];W[le]LB[oc:A]C[Don't want my group being attacked, and here I thought "A" was not good.

Why? Black's group seems a lot weaker than yours. But perhaps a peep at N15 would be better than your move (jantje)]
;B[me]C[How to answer?];W[lf]C[OK! (jantje)];B[ld];W[kd];B[lc]
(;W[oe]LB[ph:A][qi:B]C[Bad move I think, should be at "A" or "B"?

If Black can play here he is almost alive. So your move is certainly to the point. However, it may be best to build up strength along the right side and for your top side group. If Black is not careful, an attack may still be possible later (jantje)]

;W[jc];B[ig];W[id];B[if];W[ge]TR[le][lf][jg][kg][lg]C[I managed to save this group...
But marked stones are in danger];B[fe]
(;W[gf]LB[ih:A]C[Is "A" better play?

No, A is very much worse and loses the game immediately 
:-Q
(jantje)];B[ih];W[li]C[Is a slack move?

Your choice is limited to M11, L11, K11 (jantje)];B[mh]LB[nj:a]
C[This helps White more than Black, better to get out immediately at a (jantje)]
;W[ji];B[ii];W[jj]C[A time-out seems appropriate here.
The position that Black and White have created together is really complex. Before we can find the best moves here we must answer basic questions about the weak groups of Black and White.

(see variations)]
(;B[ij]
(;W[jk]LB[ff:a]C[Based on the analysis shown at the previuos move, I think that White should play A here to get both the top and the left side group out of danger.]
;B[ff]C[Exactly!];W[gg];B[fg];W[gh];B[fh];W[hk]LB[gi:A]C[Now I think this was bad
Even A was better for me

True, this should have been the losing move (jantje)];B[gi]
(;W[hi]LB[fi:A]C[A very very bad...
i must have play A

It does not really matter anymore (jantje)];B[hj];W[hh];B[fj]
;W[gk];B[gj];W[ei];B[fi];W[ib]
(;B[kb];W[jb];B[lb];W[gb]C[Saved by the bell! The game starts anew.
How about the status of Black's group at the top now?

Answer: Locally, Black still cannot live unconditionally. And the White centre group has become strong! Therefore, having failed to kill, Black is in danger now. (jantje)]
;B[ik];W[km];B[nj]C[This is a point that White should have taken earlier (jantje)]
;W[qj];B[ck];W[cj];B[dk];W[ch]C[A must move? or this was alive?

It seems impossible to find life for the White group if you let Black play here. So you are right, the White move is forced.]

C[Can I live here? Or when I can live in this corner? Or how to live if its possible?

That question would have been harder to answer if you had not strengthened Black first. Now, living is out of the question. Before, it just might have worked... (jantje)]

Having looked at the variations:
1. The "crosses" White group can get into difficulties if Black has a lot of stones nearby
2. The triangled Black group and the squares White group must run for they cannot make two eyes.
3. The White circled group must not become surrounded or else it will die.
