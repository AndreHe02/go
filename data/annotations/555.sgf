;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dq];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[fn]C[Although this move prevents a cut at D6
(at this point in the game), it allows
white too much opportunity to make a
good move on the left side. D6 or D7
is a better play.];W[cf]C[This allows black to make a good pincer  on the next move. Black likes this move.]
;B[ci]C[This is the right idea.];W[cc];B[dc]C[My intuition is that this is the
wrong side. Black at C16 splits
white in two and would build a
wall to be used with C11 to push
white around by attacking C14.];W[cd];B[df]C[Black probably shouldn't leave that  weakness at D15. An extension along  the top, say G17, would be better first.]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[de];B[ee];W[ce];B[ff]C[Black should be more worried about the
other cut at E16 and perhaps
make that move (at E16) instead.
F15 or F16 at also possible but
would leave white lots of places
to peep.];W[dh];B[ch];W[eh];B[gh]C[Again, this leaves white with lots
of options. The bamboo joint, with
F13 instead puts more pressure on the
2 white stones.];W[fg];B[ef];W[gg];B[gf];W[hg];B[ie];W[dj];B[cj]
;W[ek];B[dl];W[ck];B[bk];W[cl];B[bl];W[dm];B[cm];W[em];B[dk]
;W[dn];B[ej];W[fj];B[el];W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[iq]C[Seems to me this should be at least one
line higher, otherwise white could gain  tremendous influence toward the center  by pushing down on this stone. It's also  too far from the other two isolated
black stone to really threaten a rescue,  but too close to make a subsequent rescue
move an ideal extension.];W[gp];B[ho]C[Make an extension toward the right
first. If white defends on the right,  then consider this move and if white  responds on the left, give it up and  get more compensation to the right.]
;W[lq]C[White now gets to attack and make
an extention at the same time.];B[go];W[gl];B[fk]C[The black group wasn't threatened.
White can connect at any time with
E5. Yherefore this move has little value.];W[jm];B[fp]C[Good move, but in this situation,
a move like K5 first will threaten  to let black live by running out.
If white blocks, THEN F4 has a
much better chance of ensuring
life.];W[eo];B[fq];W[kc];B[mc]C[This invites white to attack the black
shape to the left. Black J17, white O17,
black Q17 would leave black much better
off. N17 would be a good combination
extension/attack if the black group was
stronger.];W[hc];B[jd]C[Black should defend the cut at E16
instead with a move like G16 which
defends and makes a better shape.];W[db];B[fc];W[gb]C[White is losing the aji of the
cut or atari on the D17 stones
with these plays.];B[eb];W[ld];B[jc];W[jb];B[kd];W[le]C[White has left too many weaknesses,  white has good center influence from  below and should probably just connect
at M17 or live on the edge with M18.];B[kb];W[lc];B[ib]C[M18 better. White will die on the
top anyway and M18 has a huge
impact on the security of N17.];W[qd];B[qe]C[Black is not strong enough on the
top to want this fight.];W[pc]C[Good fighting spirit for white here.]
;B[rd];W[qc];B[od]C[Black can't leave both cuts undefended.]
;W[oc];B[nd];W[rc];B[re];W[lb];B[ja]C[N18 is a better plan. If white captures
one stone, black can connect at J17.
Then white's upper right corner is under
severe attack.];W[mb];B[pj]C[This invites white to make an ideal
extension. If black plays R6, white
will probably pincer around R8 or R9,
then black R10/11 is an extension and
counter pincer. The R6 stone will  have to run out, but it should be
possible to save it with threats to
the lower right corner.];W[ql];B[rj];W[ol];B[nj];W[jg];B[mf]
;W[nh];B[lg];W[mi];B[mj];W[ki];B[li]C[Black can't keep white from connecting
with this tactic. So instead, black  should worry about eye space with a  move at P12 or near there. But before  defending underneath like that, Black  can play at M10 in sente, threatening  to play M11 in order to extend one more  line into the center.]
;W[lh];B[lj];W[kg];B[lf];W[ke];B[kf];W[je];B[jf];W[if];B[he]
;W[gj];B[gk]C[Black should be more worried about
the lower right corner - it's huge.  Black can always erase some territory  in this area because there is access  from the right too.]
;W[hj];B[kj];W[hk];B[ji];W[kh];B[ih];W[ig];B[fh];W[hh];B[ei]
;W[cb]C[White seems worried about life with  this move. but I don't think black
can kill if white omits it. Thus
there are much bigger points to play.];B[oq]C[Too deep. A play around O5 or N6 has
two directions to run for safety and  can do a lot of erasure.]

;W[fe];B[di]C[In the end, I think black's loss is due  to a series of plays that make an error  I often commit myself. Black seems to  have been worried about white's moyos  and influence and stopping them rather  than making black's own extensions
and moyos. This is especially true
in the lower right corner, white got  to make the dual-purpose moves:  attacking and extending with one move.  Black had too many single purpose moves.  It is very hard to make moves that set  things up so that almost any follow-up
move will have multiple meanings, but  looking for ways to play like this will  have big payoffs. If you can't find  such a play, then tenuki and find a  point of equal value to make in trade.]
