R OK. 

This is what you will find.

Move 64 contains a rather long analysis / explanation, I hope it helps.

I did some comments on fuseki, even if you didn't request them.]

C[R: it's usually better to play on the east (right) side. "A" marks tye famous Shusaku formation. The reason why Black likes "A", is that otherwise White can flatten him, by playing "A" himself,  or go taisha, playing "B". I guess White "C" also is possible (different story).]

(;W[ep]LB[pe:A]C[I couldn't see any serious consequence of not responding to R4. Is this an okay tenuki?

R: Yes. But still, I'd play "A". Now you have a stone that puts even more pressure on black if he decides to crawl. Entering the lower left corner still very good though.]

;B[di]
(;W[fb];B[dj];W[db]C[This is my big question: who got the better result of this ko?

R: Black.

No, seriously - long analysis following.

Let's see how we can evaluate who is ahead here.

The criterion is, if you can find a sequence that results in something better for you, then, you had a bad exchange.

Another thing.

Stop right here. I see the tendency, typical in beginners, to lean on the opponent's building/stones, so as to maximize the "territory" you "get" on your side.

This idea is WRONG.

The reason that you sometimes want to lean, is that, where it works, it is MOST POWERFUL.

(In the same way that splitting is a fundamental principle. The cut, which is the splitting that causes most damage, because it is most close to the opponent stones)

This does not mean that you always need to (or can) do so, though.

Especially in cases (like this one) where doing so, you get a WEAK SHAPE.

The typical example where this happens, is when you crawl on a wall. Typical 20k mistake.

If you always lean on your opponent, your stones are weak.

Do so, when it's most forceful.

Do not, when it results in a weak position.

It is a bit like the metaphor: you need to be able to STAND ON YOUR OWN.

Lean, through choice.

Through choice, stand upright.

Do not be afraid to leave "dame points" around.

Only power is important.]
(;B[ch]SQ[eb][bc][cc][dc][bd]C[R This move is really honte, but...

Let's count the result:
 - black corner died - + 25 points for you
 - black succesful invasion in white moyo - i'd estimate at around + 40 for black
 - the problem being, the invading group is now strong, and cannot be weakened by leaning to the weak J15 group. Otherwise you'd get some points attacking it. Like this, you're worse off.]
;W[dl]C[R: You still have to split black to hope to win. The move is big and a nice feeling to it, but is not the point to play now (and if need be, you just sacrifice 2 stones, E8 E9, and save the rest, F4 and friends)]

;B[hf]C[Was tenuki from black a good move, seems like I did okay on the right side.

Problem of triangle formation - O4 group - is good for attacking, has B weakness exposed when white A is there though. Go is a game of balance - you can't have everything.
