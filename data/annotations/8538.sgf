AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi reviewer, i'm black and my name is raul. this is a game played with a  6d japanese amateur player who is in cuba with educational purpose.

is a honor for me that you take your time to review my game, thank you very much, all comments will be more than well received.

i proposed 4 stones because even as you can see my level 1k, we (cubans) can't be sure of what actually is our level, and so i thougth i could make it with a 4 handicap game.

i'm quite interested in your opinion about my style, my way of playing, my decisions, please if you could also add some of your experiences to improve my game, i'll be more than gratefull.
finally, please don't comment ONLY the moves i ask for, feel free to comment others too.
thank you again

Hi, Raul, my name is Bernd, I am 2d in Germany. I call myself HonFu in the GTL, on KGS and in other online go places.

I feel honored that I can comment this game, although I suppose that your strong opponent already gave you some comments of a higher value. 

Anyway, I'll try my best. ;-)];W[qf];B[pi];W[nc];B[oe];W[qc]
;B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[pg]C[Hon: This move here aims too much at taking points and does not work well with your influence strategy.]
(;W[fc];B[cf];W[fq]
(;B[eq]LB[jp:A]C[Hon: This is not considered good. You just strengthen white and give him the perfect extension while he can still aim at invading your corner. 

You only attach like this, when you already have a pincer stone around A.]
;W[fp];B[cn];W[jq]
(;B[hc]C[may be a little aggresive??? what do you think??....

Hon: The upper right is a living, solid group, that is standing low, with little potential for development.

So the strategical idea usually applied here is: "Stay away from solid groups."

I would not call this move here aggressive, because you will neither kill nor die, but you just play in a spot of little value.]
;W[fe];B[he];W[fg]C[Hon: You can hunt him of course, but in the end your H17 group will not do that much. It will live and have a few points.]
(;B[dh]C[but i'm happy with B20....

Hon: At a cost!];W[kc]C[Hon: You tenuki and get attacked yourself.]
;B[hg];W[fi];B[dj]C[and with B 24

Hon: Locally the moves look good, but your useless, weakish group at the top does NOT look good.

You give something and lose something. If you would not have played H17 but tried something else, you would only gain, not lose.]
;W[hj];B[ke]LB[kf:A]C[another option???

Hon: Playing a defensive move was asked for, as you did. Maybe more normal would be A, but shape is not really my strong point.]
;W[ne];B[md]C[my opponent said really good

Hon: I wonder why. Peeps are hard to understand if you're not 5d or higher. :-)]
;W[le]
(;B[ld];W[kd];B[je];W[nd];B[me];W[mf];B[lf];W[mg];B[of];W[mi]
TR[ld][md][me]C[Hon: White squeezed out in the center and surrounded your top group. The three marked stones do not do so much I think.

But about this place I am not very sure. Peeps are difficult.]
;B[lh];W[mh]LB[ji:C][jj:B][kj:A]C[Hon: I would think about one of the points A to C now (you have to read out what works best). The important thing - get out, but don't make him stronger in the process!]
;B[ii]C[i don't know if this is really necessary???

Hon: You would have survived without this move as well, but that is not the only thing you should worry about. Getting surrounded alive is also bad.

It was better to get out without strengthening him though.]
;W[ij]C[Hon: This move is nice for him.];B[ji];W[nq]C[nice for white]
;B[qn]C[any other way for this move???

Hon: There are always other ways, but this is natural.];W[db]
;B[no]C[Hon: Good spot! 

White playing there would be annoying.];W[cc];B[cd];W[qq];B[pq]

LB[pn:A]C[missed the big problem of A

Hon: Is it that big?];W[lg];B[kg];W[ki];B[kh];W[jj];B[li];W[kj]
(;B[nf]C[Hon: Since you have a lot of influence I can see why you want to just kill these stones, but I am not sure if it is so good.]
;W[lj];B[mj];W[mk]C[Hon: Problem always is, like with Q13 - you said, "I will kill these stones". So if your opponent now plays from the outside, you are obliged to answer. 

You get points, but you hand over control to your opponent who can force you and gain influence or free sente moves.

Because it is so important, let's repeat the principle one more time - "You don't have to kill, he has to live!"]
;B[nj];W[pn]C[and there it is]
(;B[pm]C[Hon: Wrong side I think.];W[on]
(;B[nn]C[Hon: This is not good I think. Your move is damaging the other group.]
;W[om]C[Hon: See?];B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[mm];B[mq]C[any other variations??

Hon: I have showed some variations, but basically you should have played differently from the start here.

Often after you have taken the wrong course just once, every result will suck.]

;W[lo];B[lp];W[kn];B[jo];W[mo]C[same, any other variations for save this stones??

Hon: It was a hard fight here for you and therefor only likely you wouldn't get a splendid result. The problem was the beginning of it all. You must not get isolated like this, at least not without eye shape.]
;B[iq];W[lr];B[jn]C[i realized this was a bad move, it did not accomplish anything and white played exactly where i was suppose to play

Hon: This is the benefit of playing stronger players - they can teach us without a single word, just by beating us up. :-)]
;W[fm];B[gn];W[fn];B[go];W[fo];B[jr];W[ms]LB[kr:A]C[i think he could've played at A instead of W109

Hon: Probably he wanted better aji. You have less ko threats now.]
;B[kr];W[lq];B[hr]LB[gr:A]MA[fr]C[we analized the A,B (on marked X), and C (on 112) sequence but i liked this move because i can play (marked X) and does not hurts the corner, but white is good and saw a few moves ahead of me]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[cr];B[bp]C[i don't wanted to kill him, i'm ahead in points

Hon: He might want to kill YOU though. ;-)];W[bq];B[bo];W[er]
;B[dr];W[ds];B[fr]C[unnecessary!!!! and the beginning of future complications]
;W[es];B[do];W[gr];B[dl];W[ek];B[dk];W[oh]C[this move Mr. Nishijima said "wasn't him playing", he said it was irracional

Hon: Somehow comforting that even very strong players still lose it sometimes. ;-)]
;B[oi];W[ph];B[qh];W[qg];B[rd]LB[rh:A]C[we analyzed a nasty combination if black played A instead of B136, but at the end it does not work,  my opponent said this move was good]

;W[lc];B[le];W[bd];B[be];W[ac];B[km]LB[la:A]C[A is bigger than B160, is sente and also avoids complications]

[hr][jr][kr]SQ[nn][no]C[excellent move !!!!!.

of course, after you've seeing black's "orthodox" game (so as my opponent, Mr. Nishijima 6d, commented) , you can tell that black will know  W161 is a threat to the marked (triangled) group...

well, black didn't.

in the game i played A capturing one stone in gote and my opponent play B... after a long-desperate-meaningless struggle i resigned, and later when commenting the game, Mr. Nishijima, call me "careless" when i played A...

after W played B i realized that was so easy to play as in the variation and calmly save the group, i do not need to save the 2 black stones (marked square) to win
i was winning and i think by a clear difference, even in yose, white could not catch up.

black has around 60 points while white has around 39

Hon: In your comments here I can see the reason why you played A.

You lived with that group, heaved a sigh of relief, then leaned back and counted points. You switched to endgame mode. You found out, that you were ahead. Then you relaxed and thought, you had a won game. 

But watch out: THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS!

For no moment in the game you should feel safe! Go is a war game. Your opponent will be thinking about how to cut your throat - ESPECIALLY when he's behind. You must forbid yourself to feel comfortable like this - it ain't over till it's over!]
(;B[ln]LB[gp:B]C[white played B

see variation for B162

Hon: Okay, you lost concentration because you felt you had a won game. Happens. But let's look at some things again which we discussed earlier.

Look at the right side. You killed R14 - but look at the points. Your territory did not grow that much here. 

Look at the center. You killed N11 but "only for 19 points in gote. It is not at all small of course, but white got influence and was able to give you trouble at the bottom. 

Now look at the top, your pincer. H17 turned into a group that has not even 10 points yet. This was because you played where your opponent was strong. Groups like these do not necessarily die, but they just don't do a lot for your development. 

Rather - look at the left side - they prevent your own development! Since you had to run out with H17, your left side was reduced. You have got points here, alright, but that was likely from the start, since you had many stones here. But the territory was not able to GROW after H17. These mistakes helped white to catch up 40 or so points, although you were still ahead if you hadn't died.

So once more the most important things in this game:

1.) "You do not need to kill, your opponent needs to live!"
2.) "Don't play, where the opponent is solid. Make him play there!"
3.) "Never feel safe before the game is over!"

I hope I could give you some useful hints. Good luck with your further go career! :-)

(;B[gq];W[fs];B[gp]C[is so fu***** easy, what was i thinking...?]
))
(;B[nm]C[Hon: This maybe is an option. 

You lose points ...];W[om];B[ol];W[pl];B[nn];W[qm];B[oo]C[Hon: ... but can squeeze him for outside shape.

But the loss on the right looks ugly.])
(;B[np]C[Hon: Probably it is better to just play some kind of defensive move. Now HE has to worry about his stones, you didn't help him strengthen them.

(Again - "You need not kill, he needs living!"]))
(;B[on];W[pm];B[ql]LB[pj:A][qk:B]C[Hon: So what?

Although there might be trouble around A or B, I am not perfectly sure. But locally it looks manageable to me.]
))
(;B[lj]C[Hon: Normally you should get out. You defend, leave the trouble of also defending to him.]
;W[nf]C[Hon: If he defends ...];B[mj]LB[pn:A]C[Hon: ... you get on the outside, help your cutting point at A and even create a moyo.

This is another example for "don't kill, force him to live".]
))
(;B[lf]TR[md]C[Hon: My reflex would be here, from the outside. Why is the marked stone so important? (Maybe your opponent knows.)]
;W[me];B[kd];W[ld];B[jc];W[kb]C[Hon: Like this you get shape easily I think.]
))
(;B[lc]C[Hon: You should make a base. But like this your left side gets even smaller. So we see why H17 was not such a yummy point to play.]
))
(;B[db]C[Hon: Instead an idea would be to make your OPPONENT take the place of little value (the upper side).]
;W[id]C[Hon: If he defends, you could ...];B[md]C[Hon: ... just give him his points with a move like this.]
;W[mc];B[kd];W[ld];B[le];W[lc];B[ke];W[jc];B[fb]C[Hon: Later you can play here ...]
;W[gb]C[Hon: ... and if he defends, he has not even added ten points to his upper right corner!

But you have got influence in the center and a large territory in the upper left.

Identifying a place of little value is very helpful to get yourself a won game without even fighting!]
))
(;B[ip]TR[pi][pp][fq]C[Hon: Rather go on with your former plan and play for influence. Like this you put pressure on the white marked stone while at the same time developing your marked stones.]
))
(;C[Hon: You are saying all too clearly that you want to kill this stone.]
;W[qk]C[Hon: So if white comes here ...];B[qi]C[Hon: ... you might feel obliged to defend, because otherwise Q13 doesn't make sense.

But in this case ...];W[rj]C[Hon: ... white can just go on bullying you.]
;B[ri];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe]C[Hon: If you now count points, you see, that white has more than you. So your capture ends up way too small.

White doesn't play like this immediately, but even being possible to do so makes it all too easy for him to get on your nerves like this later.]
))
(;B[me]LB[md:A][qk:B]TR[qf]C[Hon: Normally you play here or at A.

Like this you do not capture the stone, but you prepare to hunt him, since he has no base with his stone. This will give you more profit in the long run. Also it's not as easy for white to play something like B, because like that he might kill off the marked stone voluntarily (while in the game it WAS already dead, so no loss).

Instead of thinking "I have to kill" you better think: "He has to live"!]
