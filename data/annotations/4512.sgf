Thank you for reviewing my game. I am White.  I am a beginner and every comment will be extremely useful.  Please do not spare my feelings with any comments. :)


jl: I think your main problem is that, when your opponent plays, you stare at the section where he played his move, thinking only of that part of the board, and thus playing there yourself. You follow him around, letting him take sente even when he plays gote moves. Invasion is not the problem. Beginners (like me!) often focus way too much on invasions. Do not worry TOO much about your opponent building some low territory on the third line, build bigger territory on YOUR side instead of invading. If you invade and do not have the tactical/strategical abilities to follow it through, then your opponent will end up very strong (even if he is a weaker player than you!) and you will probably be thin... That said, I'm not arguing for a very defensive play; but be aggressive where it counts. Also, fighting: you WILL need tactical abilities (reading) if you are to progress.. Even if your opening play is dan level, once a stronger player probes you and see that you cower out of fighting (or outright lose it), he will shred you to pieces. I once played someone my own kyu rating who had far worse reading, but he played ultra-aggressively and that is probably how he had gotten the rank: by intimidating people into thinking he knew what the f** he was doing, but he really didn't, so I won easily by fighting back. :)]

jl: May be slow, consider A-C if you want to play on the top.]

(;B[fc]LB[pj:B][qj:A]C[
jl: Black makes a mistake. There is a very clear focal point with this board as it stood before Black's last play. A and B are key points - both sides would like to extend here. Shimaris (corner enclosures) aim at side extensions.]
;W[df];B[eq];W[hq]LB[ec:1][ic:2][jc:4][jd:3][jq:A][kq:B]TR[fc]
C[

jl: No, now is the time to attack the weak stone (triangle) which Black so carelessly left to fend for itself. Anything from 1-4 would be OK, I suppose. But by coming in with the circled stone you only serve to create an eye-less dragon, as Black will play at A or B here. You got lucky though, but take care to notice how much you had to do during the middle game to fend for this weak group on the bottom here, when you instead could have built a very large upper right corner (for example).]
;B[cc]C[11: after B 11.. what can W do? I looked for a good Joseki but have yet to find one where W will end up in a good position.


jl: You can't always expect there is a joseki for equal outcome if you let yourself get into a tricky situation. ;) But here I don't think you're that badly put (in the corner that is; H3 was a big mistake).]
;W[dc]C[
jl: Right.];B[cd]LB[db:A]C[
jl: Black should have played at A. Now it is a dangerous situation for Black.]
;W[ce];B[db];W[bd]LB[eb:A]C[
jl: Try A instead. Black will be in a pickle. Might live or run, but you'll come out better.]
;B[cb];W[hc]C[
jl: A little too close for my tastes. J17 instead?]
(;B[eb]C[
jl: This is a pass move.];W[ci]C[
jl: Good. A Black play around here would have scooped out your base.]
;B[dk];W[di]LB[he:D][pj:B][qj:A][kq:C]C[
jl: Pass move. Think of A-C. Even D. Don't always follow your opponent and let him intimidate you.]
;B[pj];W[lq]LB[jq:1][kq:A]C[
jl: Perhaps over-extended. A would be normal. Black can aim at 1 later if she gets to build strength on one of the sides.]
;B[jj];W[gi]LB[ph:B][qh:A][jl:D][mo:C]TR[ff][eg][fg][eh][fh]
C[
jl: What does this move do? Protect the marked area? That area does not belong to you, since it is wide open. It is "grass" (corners are gold, sides are silver, and center is grass). Consider A-B or do something with the two (now very weak) stones in the bottom.]
;B[gk];W[hf]LB[ld:1][ee:2][ff:3][dm:A]C[
jl: Almost like a pass. It doesn't really build moyo as Black can play 1 and erase it all. Nor does it protect your grassy area, because Black has a peep at 2 and can then play 3. If you're hot on "invasions" then you could try A or something and play around with the variations. Not that there aren't better moves (like the ideas I already mentioned).]

jl: Better at A! Now you might even die... Don't worry about Black building "moyo" in the center )trinangles) unless it is very very tight, which it definitely is not in this case...]
;B[hp];W[lo]LB[jq:A]C[
jl: You're in trouble. Make a base, don't try to run (because there is nowhere to run). What if Black plays A now?]
