AB[pd][dp]C[W: I mark my comments in the game record like this. My final comments are at the last move, the scoring screen.]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[ec];B[df];W[cl];B[ic];W[cb]
(;B[bc]C[luzverano [10k\]: not sure if this was the best move, seems like D11 would have been better'

W: No, this is good, and black can always play on D11 when white replies. It's good to have a solid group here to attack top or left. If you want to secure the group by leaning on C8, it's best to play on the third line, either C11 or C10.]
;W[gc]
(;B[he]C[W: This is questionable. You seem to want to shut white in, but white can still either live or escape out, so it's better if you moves serves a secondary purpose. Playing at J15 makes a world of difference in the usefulness of the stone for the top, after white lives or escapes. It is worth considering merely securing the J17 stone as a fundament to attack from with M17 or similar.]
;W[ch]C[W: White, with this move, says he thinks black can't kill the top. I would try to prove him wrong.]
(;B[cj];W[co];B[cp];W[eh]
(;B[bf]C[W: It /seems/ too slow, but I think this move has some potential; the combination with C10 creates some aji here.]
;W[dj];B[bh];W[bi]
(;B[cg]LB[cg:A][ci:B];W[ci]C[W: Now white is solid, the exchange removed any aji C10 might have had. B12 clearly calls out for a cut with black playing C11.]
;B[md];W[kc];B[jd];W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[lc];W[kb];B[mc];W[ib]
(;B[fd]C[W: Small mistake. For profit or to kill, K18 or H18 is needed]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[ed];B[fc];W[fb];B[ee]C[W: Another mistake. What if white cuts at F15?]
(;W[dd];B[fe]C[W: Securing on G16 is better, since it also threatens L18.]
;W[cc];B[de];W[bd];B[ce];W[db];B[jb]C[W: Does not work without M18 - but that means you could play M18 in sente.]
;W[jc];B[id];W[ja];B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[kq];B[qq];W[oq];B[or]
;W[qp];B[op];W[pq];B[np]C[W: The P4->Q3 exchange gains you nothing (and weakens your corner)  - just play O4 directly.]
;W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[ro];B[po]C[W: The Q5->R5 exchange does you no good. Play Q6 immediately.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[pm];B[om];W[on];B[oo];W[pl];B[ol];W[mr];B[hq]
C[W: Mistake by both white and black here. Black should connect at O2 - and when he doesn't, white should cut at once.]
;W[fq];B[ho];W[ep];B[er]C[W: You absolutely must break out here. Always prioritize access to the centre over immediate life. If your opponent gives chase, you can always go back and live.

Furthermore, cutting solidly here breaks white up into weak groups.]
;W[do];B[ko]C[W: Attacking white does no good if he has a move giving immediate life. If you meant to gain central influence, there are much better moves, such as pushing down with Q9.]
;W[nr];B[lp]C[This move accomplishes nothing.];W[dq];B[cq];W[dr]
;B[cr];W[ds];B[cs];W[eq];B[bo];W[bn];B[ao];W[an]
(;B[bp]LB[bp:A][bq:B];W[cm];B[lr]C[W: This does nothing. Black should cut at E5]
;W[lq];B[mq];W[kr];B[ok];W[mn];B[jp];W[lo];B[mo];W[ln];B[kp]
C[W: The N5->M6 exchange gains little, and strengthens white's weak group. Play L4 directly.]
;W[ll];B[mj];W[qf];B[qh]C[W: A pincer here is needless - if you want to attack the stone, protect the corner. You already have P9 for strength below, and R12 just leaves a weak stone that prevent you from blocking off white's access to the centre.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[of];B[oh];W[mf]C[W: At this point, the black corner group is in jeopardy - you should play S17 at once, and prefer it over several future moves you make.]
;B[mh];W[lg];B[lk]C[W: If you want a splitting attack, keep playing in the middle between the two groups. Only lean on one group like this when you've decided to let it live, to build strength to attack the other.]
;W[jl];B[jk];W[hl];B[hh];W[ig];B[jh];W[jg];B[fl]C[W: You have already strenghtened white's lower middle group too much, attacking it at this point is rather futile - it can run both up and down, and attack you stone besides.]
;W[ik];B[ij]C[W: If your goal is to attack the lower middle group, you are playing too close, in this and subsequent moves. Attack from afar, defend up close. Touching your opponent's stones only strengthens them.]
;W[hj];B[gj];W[ii];B[jj];W[hi];B[ih];W[gi];B[gk];W[hk];B[fn]
C[W: Those stones are not worth saving. Keep your eye on the prize; killing the top middle white group. This move also induces white to connect a weak point, that could be attacked now or later.]
;W[en];B[fo];W[eo];B[km];W[kl];B[lm];W[kn]
(;B[ml]LB[ml:A][mm:B]C[W: Just N7 is much better. But either move is in the wrong place, when the attack at S17 is possible.]

;W[lh];B[hg]C[W: Black should have cut at M11 here. The ladder does not work, as later demonstrated.]

[bs]C[W: In summary, the main two type of mistakes that stand out are forcing moves that ignore the consequence of the follow-up (see http://senseis.xmp.net/?OneTwoThree for more details), and uncertainty in how to attack groups. The latter is a major area of go study, so not something easy to give general advice on beyond the specific points mentioned in the review, but I have heard the book Attack and Defense recommended by a lot of people as the thing to study to get better at it (e.g. see review at http://senseis.xmp.net/?Crux#attackanddefense)]
