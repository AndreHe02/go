AB[pd][dp][pp]C[RS: Hi Carsten. All my comments are prefaced with RS. I'm rasa on DGS where I am 7 kyu. Congratulations on the win, but you are correct that you gave away a number of points. If you have a chance to show this to anyone higher then I am, please do so. They will know more then I.

In my games where I'm B with a handicap of 3, I've found that W is just as nervous as I am. Have you ever played W giving 3 stones? If so, you know what it's like. My point is use W's nervousness against him, by playing solidly giving him very little chance to attack you because you only have strong groups. You have the general idea when you played k16 and q10, but let's refine it.]
;W[dd]
(;B[pj]C[RS: variation.];W[dm]
(;B[gp]C[RS: This is too defensive. All books I've read on how to play handicap as B have said B needs to attack. This is too strong from my experience. I would say B needs to always "threaten". Threaten to invade, or cut off stones. When B attacks in a handicap game, he gives W targets to attack also. W is almost always better at fighting so this  is not good. When you threaten W, he will defend and you sill strengthen yourself. You threaten W by playing close to him but not next to him. See variation.]

(;B[gc]C[I wanted to strengthen my stones and make room for two eyes.

RS: Understandable. See variation.];W[pg];B[qf];W[qg];B[rf]
C[I think this move is to small - better to play on L3.];W[mj]
;B[nq]C[A mistake - better to play on R7 to maintain the connection to the Q10 stone.

RS: On the other hand, Bq10 is only 1 stone. You have the jump to s12. This threatens to connect so W will try to capture that 1 stone but you'll be taking away over 10 points. Give 1 point, take 10 points by threatening.]
;W[pm]C[How to save my Q10 stone?

RS: Do not save it. Use it  gain territory and take away some of W's territory. The Japanese term is "aji".]
;B[qo]C[GOOD! This is threatening. W will wonder if you can save Bq10.]

(;B[rg]C[RS: How about the 1-point jump? Variation.];W[qi];B[rh]
C[All this moves were to small - better to play in the lower part or an invasion on the left side - C17 or D13.

RS: Yes, all too small. How about c17?];W[pi]
(;B[kq]C[RS: Note that the 1-point jump to s10 is still possible, but it is endgame. You should always keep these moves in mind, since it's about 10 points.]
;W[dc];B[eb]C[RS: This only strengthens W's corner.];W[db];B[he]
;W[dg]C[Now the left side belongs to him - I made it too easy for him.

RS: Actually the left side is still open. Variation.]
(;B[cn]C[RS: a and b are 2 invasion possibilities. The main  point is if W has d7-d10-d13 as he does here, then you defintely have good chances to invade.]

RS: This one is ok. Your mistake was not to play b6 or c5 earlier. The reason b6 is so good for you is you end in sente.]

;W[qe];B[qd];W[tt]C[RS: Well, Carsten, I hope my review was of some good. Let me know if you have any questions. To recap, I believe in a handicap game, B needs to threaten to invade/cut/take away eyespace, etc. This will force W to defend while giving B time to make solid groups. Threatening means playing close but not next to W's stones.]
