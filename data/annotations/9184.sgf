C[Dear Revier,

Thank you for taking the time to review my game, it helps me to improve my game a lot. I do a review of my own games after I play them, but this one is specially challenging for me and I think that I need the help of a stronger player. I did win this game for a few points, and I apologize for sending a game that I won for review, but I have some many questions about this game that I think is valid to ask for a review.

I mainly have questions about how to use my influence and how to attack more effectively when my oponent jumps in the middle of my position. In this game I felt that my position was way stronger and that I was way ahead, however, at the end I won only by a few points.

I will be asking questions in some special positions, but please feel free to comment about anything you think that will help me improve my game.

The game was played in KGS with 25min per player. I did use all my time. I took black. The result is B+ 6.5.

Thanks again.


K: I hope I will be useful, I will use "K:" before my comments.]

LB[cq:1]TR[do]C[His next move really surprised me. I thought we was going to play the triangle point, but he went for the corner with 1. I tried to play the best I could but after the exchange my position was rather thin. I went to eidogo.com and checked for a joseki, but couldn't find any for this move.

Can you show me a way to get a better result here?

K: The attachment is not really a good move, here. White is strong and should press you, you should be quite aggressive to take advantage of his shyness.
The hane is the only answer.];W[cq]
(;B[dp]C[K: This is rarely a good move, you end up in a situation 2 vs 3 stone, and you are behind. You can play this rarely, when you already have support at the top (you don't), and hopefully when white doesn't have support (he has),]
;W[dq]C[I don't wan't to push again because he may ignore and attack my sotones from the upper corner.]

(;B[cl]C[Therefore I extend to make a base, however is rather thin, but I don't want to spend another move here.]

C[So far I'm happy with Black's double wing formation.

K: this is really good for you, so far. You got many big points, while white was defending his groups. He have more solid territory, but your potential is far higher, with all the double wing formation on the right.
You can even ignore the C8 group, let it just survive with 2 eyes, and it will still be fine.]

C[I played 1, but upon review I think that I should have played something like the triangle stone. What do you think? is there a better place to play right now?

K: I think it was just fine to defend. You secure a _lot_ of points on the top, defending, and you don't really need more influence in the center, right now.]
;B[pb];W[jb]LB[hc:1]TR[ic][kc]C[This surprised me again. I thouth about playing where the triangles are, but decided to play at 1 to make a conection with my stones in the upper left (D18) area. However, I think it was mild and at the end I didn't have a conection with that group. I also played there because I wanted to drive my opponent towards my thickness, but didn't like the result at the end.

Where should I play?

K: I would go in the middle! It makes it really hard for white to reply, because left and right are miai and both end up with a weak white group under attack, in you influence,

if I had to choose one of the marked points, I would go right. Letting white escape easily in direction of his left side, you can buid up a nice wall that works well with your setup. You don't have to worry about your corner, it is alive anyway, thanks to your move in C17.]

K: As I told before, C17 ensured your life in the corner, you don't have to worry at all about that group, you can use it to attack without concern.]
;B[ie];W[hd];B[gd];W[hb];B[gc];W[gb];B[fb];W[ia];B[jh]C[Trying to make mojo, but it feels overconcentrated.]
;W[he]LB[qm:1]TR[pm][on]SQ[kn]C[My next move is at 1, but upon review I saw that it was a lost play. I also thought about the triangle spots, but thought my opponent was going to invade and live again.

Is there a better place where I could have played?

K: yes, 1 is a bit cramped, and doesn't completely defend the invasion at S4, you still have some aji.
You can play P5 if you want a completely solid corner and side.
I would have tried something more general, like a cap in L6, that expand naturally your mojo and threatens K3 (that whoud be really bad for W). If W defends, you get another free move. If white counterattack, he can't enter too much without being disconnected.]

(;B[qm];W[mh]C[I think this invasion / reduction is too deep, however I wasn't able to attack that stone effectively.

Can you show me how to do that?

K: you just have not to let any escape. W have no space to live inside, and even if you are cut, you have too much space to run and support to have troubles.]

C[My next move is at 1, but upon review I see that the triangle spot was better. However, my opponent still scapes no matter how I play. I'll show the two sequences that I can imagine where white can scape.

What do you think?

K: white has escaped since he played L9, it was all damage control after that. You can squeeze anything you can from his group escaping, but trying to kill is not an option.]

(;B[jl]C[I think this is a crude move.

K: Don't do this, really ^^ You saw how it continue, you will probably remember in your future games!]

;B[mk]TR[lj]C[This was a mistake, a lack of concentration. I don't know why I thought it would be sente. Off course I didn't read and took for granted that I could cut at triangle, which off course I can't.]
;W[nj];B[ol];W[lm]LB[bj:1]TR[ni][mj][nj][mk]C[I decided to tenuki and play at 1 since I'm getting nervous about white thickness in the bottom and center while my left group is so weak.]
;B[bj];W[bi]LB[bd:1]C[Same here. I played at 1 because that upper left group looks so weak.

K: those are all almost end game moves, being gote they are not always as good as they seem. B10 needs at least some follow up, not to be pushed later.]

;B[nr]C[K: it depends, would you tenuki to jump in M3, if W plays E6, now?
If you don't feel threatened, it is the right timing, I can't properly read on the left, to be honest. I would prefer to play E5 myself.]

LB[eh:1]TR[ei]C[My next move was a mistake. My stone ended up swallowed. Would it have been better to just play at the triangle or somewhere else to destroy his territory?

K: That zone is mostly dame. You are 10 points ahead, you just have to make sure that white doesn't squeeze those 10 points out from that no man zone!
The triangle move is perfect, white have to answer to stay connected and you can play on the other side.]

[rs][ss]C[K: you played quite well.  you don't seem to have problem in setting up an influence, walls and everything. The big mistake was trying to disconnect and kill the W group in the middle, instad of driving it peacefully, taking profit. Influence is mostly about letting you choose the direction of the game, rarely about a direct attack.
You are strong in the middlegame, when there is a lot of contact play and you use your "muscle" to fight locally. You won a lot of those situations. It may be because you like small boards, or because you do a lot of problems. That is good, but don't let it distract from the global pictures. If your opponent start to tenuki, let you take the local profit to gain more on bigger scale, it can be a problem!
It happened a couple of times, and even while you was winning locally, your 40 points lead in the beginning was thinner and thinner!]
