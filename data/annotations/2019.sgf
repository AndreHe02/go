C[phi: I am black, since I play 2 to 3 stones weaker than Andreas.

Could you help me in my middle game?


myshkin:

Dear Philipp,

In this game, I think you show a commendable inclination for thickness, a good vision of what's hot at a given time and in general good strategical skills.
The weaknesses that cost you most belong to short range tactics (the early moves in the upper left corner, moves 45 and following, move 50...) and maybe 'how tactics relates to strategy' (I'm thinking of move 39).
Maybe you could do go problems (I use and recommend Graded go problems for beginners volumes 3 and 4, by Kano; there are also problems available on the internet). Another read I recommend concerning tactics is Tesuji, by Davies. You could also watch strong players's games or learn professional games.

There are also a few slack moves (move 57). These are disastrous as they're nearly equivalent to a pass; each stone you play is very precious, always make sure it's efficient before you play one. One pass = one handicap stone so you see how this flaw relates to playing level.

Best regards,
Sebastien];B[qd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[nc]C[phi: is a white Invasion in the upper left possible?

myshkin: Do you mean upper right? A white invasion there would be a bad idea as long as he doesn't have substantial support further down. This move's an acceptable shimari (corner lock), just like the more common Black P17.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[bp];B[cq];W[en];B[cf]C[myshkin: This stone can easily be attacked by White. This is a good place to stop White from making a big moyo but the board is still open enough for Black to take other big points first. I think q9 (facing your wide shimari) or o3 are better choices. With this stone, Black is exposed to leaving White take both a local advantage and sente.]
;W[dg]
(;B[df]C[myshkin: This is a natural move but did you consider other answers? I tried a few variations with c13 and c12 which seem playable for Black. Unfortunately, I have no joseki reference available now so take these variations with a grain of salt.]
;W[ef];B[eg]C[myshkin: Although it's tempting, the cut may not be Black's best choice here as his two stones near the edge have little room. How about c13, preparing to settle Black's group on the left edge and leave White with a somewhat thin outside?]
;W[dh];B[ee];W[ff];B[ed]C[myshkin: A difficult fight lies ahead of this move. Black d15 seems to be a more reasonable move.]
;W[de];B[dc];W[cd];B[cc];W[bd];B[bc];W[ec];B[fc];W[eb];B[fd]
;W[bf];B[ad]C[myshkin: I've tried a few variations on this fight but there seems to be little Black can do about White's good result after the cut at d15.]
;W[cg];B[fb];W[fh];B[qi]C[myshkin: The strength of Black's position at the top allows him to play this stone further down (q9 for example). If later White jumps between Black's stones, he'll be severely pincered, and if he approaches from below, Black will extend to the centre and shape a nice moyo.]
;W[ic];B[kc]C[myshkin: Bad White move, good Black answer. Another possibility for Black is to play a capping move at j15. White would have little hope of connecting his stone anywhere and would have a hard time trying to put it to good use. If he tried to form a group at the top, it'd be cramped at best and Black would build a lot of strength.]
;W[qm]C[myshkin: Here's my view of the position at this point. Black made territory in the upper left corner, has a good position in the upper right corner and a safe group in the lower left corner. White's assets consist in his big moyo at the left and his not much developed postion in the lower right corner. There's a large open space near the lower edge.
I see two priorities for Black: to stop White from further extending his moyo and to take some sort of claim on the lower edge.
White's moyo can't be contained by approaching the very strong f14 f12 d12 formation. A move like g6 is more feasible but Black's stone would have little backup and White could easily push toward the centre and still extend his moyo, while Black would hardly improve his own position. Another possibility to control White's moyo is to place a stone near the centre but I think this would be prematurate and it'd give White the initiative. Seeing no good opportunity for the top priority of containing White's moyo immediately, I think I'd try a move like j4 in order to take advantage of the open space, prepare to contain White's moyo either from the bottom or from the centre, and prepare an approach of White's lower right corner.
A more aggressive option is to approach White's corner immediately but I'd be concerned that White find a way to forcefully extend his moyo in the moves that'd follow.]
;B[gf]C[myshkin: As I wrote before, I think it's a bad idea to touch this strong White position. In the following moves Black nearly (but not completely) seals a large territory but this is at the expense of White largely extending his moyo and of losing sente.]
;W[gg];B[hf];W[hg];B[if];W[qg];B[oh]C[phi: I don't know a good move. The moyo on the left is big. How to reduce that?
Or better extent on the bottom (eg. J3 ?

myshkin: Locally, I prefer q12 which controls more tightly the white stone and almost cancels any possibility for White to connect r13 with his stones below. However, you're right to be concerned about White's moyo and in this perspective a move like p11, which both responds to White's move and heads to the centre looks adequate.]
;W[pi];B[ph];W[qh]
(;B[pj]C[myshkin: Don't let White connect his stones. You could start a fight with r10 (see var).]
;W[ri];B[qj]C[myshkin: It's greatly preferrable to capture firmly (play p11) when it's possible as it is here. p11 creates a much stronger shape and prevents White from playing a ladder break.]
;W[rj];B[kq];W[iq];B[nq]C[myshkin: White's previous move breaks the ladder starting at p11. The game's becoming very unfavorable for Black. Maybe k4?]
;W[pr];B[oq]C[myshkin: This move isn't very useful as it doesn't give Black eye space and pushing through at q3 isn't a big threat so that Black loses sente. Even if White replied at q3, the move would be of little use.
You could have attacked the j3 stone with k4, defending against the ladder at the same time. j4 could also be interesting.]
;W[gp];B[ig]C[phi: I should have responded to G4. But how?

myshkin: I'm going to answer your question but I first want to mention this: your move violates an important "principle" I already touched on before: don't play a contact move against strong stones. White can quietly reply j12 to your move, extending his moyo while you accomplish little. Locally, the (non-contact) knight's move at k12 would be better.

g4 is double trouble: it encloses and seriously threatens Black's lower left group, and it reinforces White's dreadful moyo. If White can complete a really big moyo with another move, the game's probably hopeless, while Black's group may live even with no local reply immediately. I think I'd take that risk and first go after the moyo with a centre move, say j9 or maybe the more prudent k9 considering that Black has many weaknesses.]
;W[bq]
(;B[br]C[phi: how to live here??

myshkin: The key is to make the fight on the left interact with the black stones on the right. See the variations.]
;W[dr]C[phi: Is my corner dead?

myshkin: Not quite if you threaten to connect to your group on the right, but this time you'll end split from the right group _and_ gote, at best.]
;B[cr];W[eq]C[myshkin: Now I think it's really dead. The game's lost.]

;B[hp];W[io];B[nj]C[myshkin: Reasonable move.];W[ih];B[hh]C[myshkin: Bad move. Maybe j9?]
;W[ii];B[jh];W[ji];B[kh];W[ll];B[no]C[myshkin: In the following moves, you did a good job of saving your group at the bottom. However this was possible probably because White was confident about his advance.
