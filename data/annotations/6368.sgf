C[*: Hi all my comments will start with *.  I been playing Go for about 6 years now and have learned most of it from people at local club, reading books, and mentors I met online.

*: Please don't be offended by my comments I will give you straight answer on what I see wrong.

1st Run: Both sides have made many mistakes on the direction of play, life and death, tesuji, and strategic mistakes.

*: I will be commenting the game as I see it, that is you might have made the same move I suggest but that just means in my opinion it should be sooner then you played it.

*: Last, I am only 4K* on IGS, so please take the comments as that, they are not the absoloute truth.

*: Thanks!];B[dd];W[dp]C[(2) -> hi];B[pd];W[pp];B[pn]MA[qn]
[cn][jd][jq]C[*: Some what ackward with black stones at 4,4 (D16) and 4,16 (A16).

*: Marked "X" would be more normal, nothing terribly wrong, experimenting is a good thing, lets see what happens :).]
;W[ql]C[*: Hmm I don't know if I like whites move here, the feeling is he doesn't want to let black get all the right side.  But whites future on that side is somewhat limited.

*: Looking at pro games that pattern showed up total of 23 times on GoBase.org, at different times.  (Just the corner).

*: And if I take the entire right side into account it shows up ONLY ONCE.  In that case please look at the attached example on how to proceed.]

(;B[pl]C[*: Ohh that probably hurt you, as it helps white.  You attach to defend not attack.

*: So here neither side is too strong or weak, so why not attack like in the example.]
;W[qk]C[.];B[pk]MA[qm]C[*: Proverb, "Never push the cart from behind".  Meaning if you pushing white on from behind like with 6/7, 8/9.  You are just encourging white to take the lead.

*: Shape move is 13,17 (R7).];W[jp]C[*: White should HANE 10,16 (Q10) to get off the 3rd line.]
;B[oo]C[*: Your scared white is going to take the entire bottom?  If so why help him?  You are asking for P4 onces white has few more stones there it will make it really hard to invade. 

*: If you are worry about the safty of your group start with 13,17 (R7) as it is the Eye shape point.]
;W[qn]
(;B[po]C[*: ................ What is this?  Common you have to fight #12, i would recommend 15,17 (R5). Please look at both examples.]
;W[qo];B[op];W[pq];B[oq];W[pr];B[or]C[*: You just finish playing 4 moves with ZERO VALUE!!!!!!

*: Your are making a great wall that has been neturalized by 16,10 (K4) before it came into existance.

*: Second comment moves like #19 - 18,15 (P2) are called End-Game moves, you playing that doesn't get you anything doesn't hurt white at all, he can take the sente and even hurt your wall more with 10,16 (Q10) now.]
;W[qp]C[*: No need.];B[qj]C[*: GOOD! Stop white.];W[rk]MA[qk]
[ql]C[*: GAH! Enough with the empty triangles, (X) this is refered to as empty triangle.  The only good move here is 10,18 (S10).]
;B[rj];W[jj];B[sk]C[*: And this will accomplish what?  This is called early x-mas present.  And since X-mas already passed we'll call it early birthday present.  White wants to defefend his weakness at 13,17 (R7) why help him do it?  What did you expect he will answer at 12,19 (T8) so you can take advantage of him?

*: You got to play the best possible move on the board and not the one that looks easy.]
;W[qm];B[lr]C[*: What the heck?  this doesn't even give you a base, missclick maybe?  I think 17,12 (M3) is the base move here not that you need it yet.

*: Better move 3,15 (C6) stop white from making a huge moyo.]
;W[mg]C[*: ???? Meaning less?  Maybe trying to threaten 10,16 (Q10).   If white is going to threaten a cut like that, might as well CUT!!]
;B[pg];W[nc];B[nd]C[*: Right idea, but wrong move.  Needs to be 15,5 (O15).]
;W[mc];B[md]C[*: Again pushing the cart from behind, you are felling behind fast here.]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[kb]C[*: Why???? What does this do, why not 10,3 (K17).  Why not take few more free points, or start a fight at 12,4 (M16).  This move is really a bad use of a stone, not wasted, but the most inefficeint use of the stone.]
;B[id];W[gc]C[*: ?????];B[ib]C[*: GOOD!];W[cc]
(;B[ce]C[*: Whats with angle moves?  Only right move here is 4,3 (D17). Please look at example.]
;W[dc];B[fd];W[fc];B[ec];W[eb];B[ed];W[pb]
(;B[hc]C[*: Nice idea, but wrong direct of attack, you want to attack in a such a way that it helps you not hinders you.

*: By playing that you are asking to be split at 4,8 (G16). Please look at example.]
;W[gd]C[*: KAB000M!];B[ge]
(;W[gb]C[*: What the who?  If white played 4,7 (G16), why he didn't follow through with it, next move should be 5,15 (H15). Please look at example.]
;B[hd]C[*: right idea, but spot.  5,8 (H15) is the proper move.]
;W[hb];B[ha];W[qf]C[*: Slight Overplay.];B[pf];W[qd];B[qc]C[*: Good :).]
;W[rd];B[pc];W[rc];B[ob];W[ga];B[ia];W[jd]C[*: Oopps ... i guess that is a bit annoying to the right hand group but.  6,1 (F19) is more dangerous.  Please look at example.]

(;B[jc]C[*: ohh silly mistake 6,1 (F19) is where the game is at.]
;W[ld];B[je];W[le]
(;B[ke]C[*: uhhh? What is that for?  your group on the inside is weak if you are going to do anything make a shape move at 14,6 (O14). Please look at example.]
;W[oc]C[*: That hurts, a bit .. now if you placed #71 at 14,6 (O14) you wouldn't have to work soo much. Please look at example.]

(;B[od]TR[la][lb][mb][ma][na][nb][ob][oa][pa][qa][ra][rb][sb]
[sa]C[*: I know it's tempting to save the heavier group, 2 stones worth more then 1 stone right?  But in this case that one stone on the top is worth alot more then the 2 stones you just saved.

*: You playing this (assuming white does the correct move at 17,2 (R18)..

You saved 2 stones, and made zero points, and took away 4 points from white.  And on top gave white 15 points.  So you playing gave white 11 Points in total.

Now if you played 17,2 (R18) ...];W[qb]C[*: This hurts.  I see black won by resign, right now this game is in whites favor, so white must have made some serious mistakes.]
;B[nb];W[rb]C[*: Why?  If white is worried about the weakness at 18,2 (S18), why not eliminate it right away by taking out the cutting stones at 15,2 (P18)?]
;B[mb];W[lc];B[lf];W[kf]C[*:Over play, whites group is in trouble at 11,2 (L18).  White has to take care of the black cutting stones above first.  Blacks next move can kill the entire group.]

(;B[jf]C[*: ................................... Way off side. Please look at example.]
;W[me];B[kg];W[ne];B[mf]C[*: uhmm you just lost all your stones. Correct move was 15,6 (P14).]

(;W[qg]C[*: ?? 16,6 (Q15) Please look at example. White's first Big mistake, worth 30 points.]
;B[nf]C[*: White gets a safty, wrong direction.  HAS TO BE 15,6 (P14) or 16,5 (Q15).]
;W[oe]C[*: White misses the safty... and gives black an early birthday present.]
;B[pe]C[*: Second 30 point mistake by white.];W[of];B[og]
(;W[qe]C[*: Why? Doesn't do any thing, another mistake.  Gave black free move. To kill him :(, correct move is 12,2 (M18).

*: Might the game losing move.];B[ng]C[*: Very Good.];W[na]
C[*: It's too late.];B[lb];W[jb]C[*: Fishing.];B[ka]C[*: Game move, worth 40 points.]
;W[dj];B[kj];W[oi]C[*: My teacher always told me if you are going to threaten a cut .. CUT directly.]
;B[pi];W[qh];B[ph];W[lj];B[ki];W[gg]C[*: White has lost all hope and is playing random in hopes black will make mistake.  I'll continue but will only point out major blunders ...]

*: Black should save that stone, should save his group.]
(;B[kh];W[fi];B[ei];W[if];B[hg];W[hh];B[lk]C[*: Overview ....

This was a very interseting game, even though I would normally say don't send games for review that you won.  In this game I think we have an expection because there are soo many coin flips in this game its any ones game.

Few things to consider:

1) You seriously need to consider shapes when making move decissions, right now there is no shape move in the game so it hurts the development of the game.  I recommend Shape Up! on GoBase.org or Making Good Sahpes by Bozulich.

2) Direct of play was wrong in few places, when attack attack from your strong groups towards strong groups.   If you have weak groups on the board first fix your weakness before going for your oponnents weakness.

3) You pretty much followed white around the board until white lost the top group, play your own game stop felling into someone elses rythm.

4) Walls are strong attacking bases, but they are useless if they are counter stones in place like on the bootm.

I hope this review helps, feel free to mail me if you any questions.]

White got 5 points (triangle, stones worth 2 points)+4 points on top (total of 9 points).

Black got 2 points.

Therefore this move gave white net 7 points.  

From the alternative this move 4 points better then the other route. 

And the added benfit of taking even more away on the top, your group almost being 100% alive, and whites group is looking a bit shaddy what more can you ask for?]
