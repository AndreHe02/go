C[I would appreciate any comments that you could give.];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jp]C[A standard fuseki so far.];W[cn]C[This is the most common approach to the sanrensei.]
;B[cl];W[cq]C[Good.];B[cp]C[Wrong direction for black, should block on the other side.

This way you undermine his K4 star point stone.

This was the first mistake of the game - thankfully not yours!]
;W[dq];B[dn]C[This move is too lenient - the C6 stone will naturally die if black puts pressure on the corner group instead.]
;W[ep]C["Hane at the head of two stones". Good move - punishes black's mistake and gives him the second hane at B4 to worry about.]
;B[eo];W[fp];B[bp]C[Painful for black to have to go back and protect.]

(;W[bq]C[No need to respond to black directly here, you can extend to the right instead - see variation.]
;B[hq];W[qn]C[Good, black's move didn't threaten the life of your group so there are bigger points like this one.]
;B[ql];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[qi]C[Unusual - Q5 is a key 'bulge' point in this position.]
;W[po]C[Excellent. Opponent has let you hit him on the head twice now.]
;B[qf];W[nc];B[rd]
(;W[nq]C[Is there a better way of attacking the two black stones?

This move is good. Another possibility is O4 (see many variations) - this will most likely lead to the black stones' capture or being forced onto 2nd line with you getting thickness in the center.

The move you chose, O3 is better as a sacrifice to attack K4 stones (see variation).

Another thing to consider is that these stones may be too small to attack right now - there are big points in the opening still left such as on the top and left sides. If black in the meantime spends a move defending these stones, you get another free move elsewhere. Otherwise you can still attack these stones after the other big points have gone.]

(;B[op]
(;W[pr]C[This move is a bit slow - on the second line it isn't affecting the rest of the board much.

Better to attack black stones from above or the side to gain influence.]
;B[or];W[qr];B[np]
(;W[os]C[This is just an endgame remove and it also removes any potential the O3 stone might have had in the future, so you should save it until much later - it is your sente and your opponent's gote so it is your 'privilege' to play this sequence.

If you are going to play locally, either O2 or P3 is better (see variations).]
;B[nr]C[This exchange has helped stabilize black's group.];W[qc]
C[A big point, but perhaps F16 more interesting? Much harder to invade the top side afterwards.]
;B[om]C[Seems unneccessary at the moment - other points bigger.]
;W[pm]C[Pushing and cutting here is not good - black now has strong groups on either side, so there is nothing to be gained.]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[on];W[ok];B[nl];W[nk];B[ml];W[mk];B[lm]C[This sequence has helped black develop some territory without giving you a lot in return.]

(;W[qg]C[This is an interesting attempt to indirectly help your heavy group (O9).

Perhaps a shoulder hit like Q12 might be better tho, see variation.]
;B[pg];W[ph]C[Turns out this hane isn't good. An alternative continuation would be to try to live underneath by playing R12 - but it is too early for this and it would hurt your O9 stones.]
;B[qh];W[pf]C[This atari is not so good - if black extends...]

(;B[rg];W[og];B[qg]C[Aha, you are lucky. Result is very similar to shoulder hit variation.]
;W[oh];B[pe]
(;W[of]C[Should play ko instead, it will seal the black group in completely, and it is hard for black to win it (see variation).]
;B[oe];W[ne]
(;B[qd];W[od];B[qe]C[Slow for black to connect.];W[jd]C[Good, a big point.

Slightly too close to your own thickness, F16 or G16 look better.]
;B[lk]C[A good move from black - on the boundary between your developing areas.]

(;W[mi]C[Can hane here - push black back to enlarge your moyo (see variation).]
;B[ki]C[Good punishment from black - your moyo is reduced a lot.]
;W[bo]C[Good idea to create some aji to use on the outside.
C14 is also big, but if you can reduce black's moyo in sente, that's great.]

(;B[ao]C[Black should probably hane at other side (A3) to get sente.]
;W[an];B[ap];W[aq];B[do];W[dm];B[cm];W[fn];B[co];W[bn];B[bm]
;W[fo];B[am];W[in];B[fr];W[er];B[fq];W[eq];B[cg]C[A big point - C14 better tho (black is now very thick in bottom left).

Perhaps it is time for black to invade instead - F17 is also possible.]
;W[ce];B[db]C[A tricky invasion/probe.];W[fc]C[Good direction - taking the outside instead of corner.]

(;B[cc]
(;W[dc]C[Play E18 directly instead?];B[bb];W[eb];B[bd];W[da]
C[i dont know what i was thinking here...should have blocked at c15

Yes B15 undermines black's territory, while threatening ko in the corner.]
;B[bf]
(;W[lj];B[kj];W[kk];B[ll];W[jk]C[Aggressive.

Make sure you don't push black into your own territory.

You can feel how poweful black's keima at L11 was now.

Better to simply enlarge territory from the other side.];B[ii]

;W[fh];B[gh];W[gg];B[fg];W[hg];B[ff];W[ge];B[lc]C[i thought the game was pretty even before this invasion i lost a lot here.

Before the invasion, you have roughly 65-70 points and black has 65, so you are slightly ahead.

This invasion is unreasonable, you can kill it in theory, but it may be hard!]

(;W[ld]C[I don't think this is the best response - it gives black some possibilities to play with, better to defend solidly, for example K17 and see how black plans to escape or make eyes (see variations).]

Your main mistakes were (in order of decreasing severity):

- Not dealing with invasion at top properly.
- Not realising the vital point on the border line between the two moyos before your opponent did.
- Making your opponent too strong by sacrificing stones.
- Some overagression / wrong direction in the middle game fighting.
- Occasionally playing small points instead of big ones, particularly in early endgame, but also in the opening.

I felt you started off with a good lead after the opening, but this gradually decreased, and was finally turned negative by the invasion at the top.

I hope this review has been helpful, let me know if you have any further questions.]
