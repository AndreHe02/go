C[lcdk [23k\]: hi
danmesser [22k\]: hi, gl

taw: Hi there as well. I'll be reviewing your game.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[pj]SQ[jc][jd][cj][dj][qj][cn][dn][pn][qn][jp]
[fq][jq][nq]C[I have read that one should strengthen their corners before sides before the center, so looking back was this move too far into the side?

Should I have focused initially on providing a base in my corners?

taw: This is perfectly fine. Any of the moves marked by squares looks very sensible, including Q10. Developing corners would be fine but a bit slow.]
;W[dj];B[el]SQ[dm][pm][cn][dn][pn][qn][fp][gp][jp][mp][np][fq]
[jq][nq]C[taw: Now this is very dubious. Stones on 5th line have extremely hard time living. Moves on 3rd or 4th lines are much better because they have much easier time making live groups on side, and they threaten white groups by denying them side. Here white will probably be able to connect D10 with D4, or if black cuts, white will have a lot of moves to extend both D10 and D4 into livable groups.]
;W[ch];B[dg]SQ[cf]C[I decided to contest white's extension in order to create some space for myself.

I was consciously avoiding direct contact with my opponent's stones as I didn't want to get into a fight early -- I just wanted to try and make sense of creating territory.

taw: This is good intuition. Move like C14 would be a lot stronger.]
;W[cg]
(;B[dh];W[ci];B[df]C[With white's contact I knew I had to directly help the stone at D13, but I didn't really know much more than to just connect in a manner directed towards my corner.

Was there a better way to defend the touch on the stone at D13?

taw: D14 is the best local move.];W[cf];B[ce]C[Here I felt I needed to stop white's advance, and my proximity to my corner stone made me feel comfortable directly opposing white's wall.]
;W[be]SQ[ce][cf][df]C[taw: Both players play really nicely now. D14 C14 C15 B15 are all best local moves or nearly so. The big mistake is the next one...]
(;B[de]TR[dd][ce]SQ[cd]C[Thinking about it, this connection feels unneccessary. I seemed to have been concerned about a potential cut in my wall, but my position seems strong enough that I don't need to tighten up so proactively.

taw: There's a very common pattern - empty triangle shape usually means a bad move. It's true here as well, B16 would be by far superior way to block white's from advancing into the corner.]
(;W[af];B[bj]SQ[cl]C[taw: Ouch... What is black's plan here? B10 and E8 do not support each other, B10 cannot live on its own, and white cannot be easily killed.

Notice how if E8 was played on C8 instead, B10 would suddenly make a very nice move.]
;W[ck];B[bh]SQ[bj][el]C[With these two stones I am trying to contest white's entire territory on the left side. I want to make it so that either his group cannot live or that in fighting he squanders enough territory that his attack this far up the left side won't be profitable.

Should I have just let them develop this seemingly small group? I felt  comfortable doing this because thinking globally I thought that I could hold a large chunk of the board because of my two stones, E8 and Q10. I could have tried to develop a more defensible position on top or contested his weaker corner, Q4, perhaps?

taw: Now black has 3 stones which do very little. B10-B12 cannot possibly live unless black managed to kill white group somehow, but white group can expand to upper corner, connect with lower concer, or just has enough space on the side to live.

It also shows why E8 wasn't a good move - with white group alive E8 is extremely unsafe and provides neither territory nor influence.]
;W[bi];B[di];W[ah]C[I think I should have been more concerned about white's possible connection at C10, which would inevitably void a large amount of my effort in this fight through the liberties it provides.]
;B[bg]
(;W[bf];B[bd];W[ad]
(;B[aj]C[taw: If A16 isn't answered somehow B16 might be wasted. White is pretty much unkillable here.]
(;W[ag];B[ai];W[cj];B[ac]C[I feel I misplayed this fight. I went wholly in on trying to kill his group, but I now see it was almost futile because of the bottom connection. I think I could have gone with my commitment to dismantle white's group on the left, but my execution faltered and white secured territory as a result.

My corner was somewhat developed through this attack, albeitly lamely. I don't think it was good development, just a sad consequence of which I perhaps should have prioritized (corner development, that is).

taw: Yes, you shouldn't have gotten into this fight. Just blocking white's group on the top would be much better. B17 would be better than A17 since white B17 can start some shenanigans now.]
;W[bk];B[ae]C[taw: This is a way to protect B17 cut I guess.]
;W[ak]C[This hurts, but improperly playing this fight leads to my stones being called out on their greediness in attack.

taw: True, but white wasted ridiculous number of moves finishing off your black stones, so black wasn't punished for greediness as severely as it could.]
;B[dn]SQ[hp][fq]C[taw: That's not the best move since black D6-E8 stones can easily be cut from the side, but at least it goes after open space. Stones on 5th line like E8 provide very little support in general and here it shows Imagine instead of these 2 stones you had let's say H4 and F3 - now that would be really hard for white to deal with while protecting its corner.

Early game playing on 3rd/4th lines is the way to go. 2nd and 5th lines are too situational. It might be hard to notice this because games are resolved in huge fights, but good opening is what makes fights tilted towards one or the other of players.]
;W[cn];B[do]C[With that fight seemingly resolved and fresh on my mind, I wanted to try and prevent white from leveraging that strong territory into a stronger corner.

I don't think I really knew what I was aiming at past "place some defensible stones in white's way and don't overextend."]
;W[co]
(;B[dm];W[cm]
(;B[dl]TR[dd][ce][de][el][dm]SQ[cd][em]C[This wall felt good for my purposes, as with the stone at D10 I thought white could aggressively build their wall a line or two further towards center. This more conservative (seemingly) placement for white made me think white was perhaps underestimating their own position?

In the end I guess I felt like I was being rewarded for bad play, but was white's placement okay? With a group on the left I feel that aggressively denying black's space in the bottom left side/corner would be very beneficial and not too difficult.

See w41 node.

taw: Stones D5-E8 are very weak - you might end up connecting them to some live group but white can push them into the center while getting entire left side, lower left corner, and half of left side.

Also, open triangle shape suggets bad play, correctly.]
(;W[cl];B[qo]TR[ep]SQ[pm][qm][pn][qn][np][mq][nq]C[taw: R5 is not the greatest way to approach the corner, but approaching corner defended by just one stone is a good idea. It's more typical to approach a bit more lightly, like on one of marked squares.

E4 would probably be a better move, since D5-E8 gruop seriously needs reinforcement, and white E4 is extremely powerful, but after E4, approaching lower right corner is the second best thing.]
;W[qp];B[nq]C[These last two moves are me returning to my train of thought that I would be well behooved to attack white's underdeveloped corner (in retrospect I am lucky that my top right corner was not attacked -- does my stone at Q10 help my defenses? It seems so far out).

taw: As you can see R5 would be a lot safer at R6, and it would bother white a lot more. Still, these are minor points.]
;W[po];B[qn];W[ad]SQ[pn][no][ep][or]C[I don't understand white's play here, their group seems airtight considering the connection to the wall in the bottom-left corner.

taw: White has very little focus here, yeah. If white played on any of marked squares it would be a lot more powerful.]
;B[on]SQ[pn][ep][kq][pr]C[taw: Black should either lock the right side witht Q6, securing all R5-R6 group and extending connection to Q10, or lock the corner and secure its O3 stone with Q2. (or something like L3 or E4 again) P6 is very weak.]
;W[oo]TR[po][pp]SQ[op]C[taw: Black stones touching white are too aggressive and they're putting themselves in unnecessary danger.

White makes empty triangle shape, and like 99% of the time, it's a mistake. White Q6 cut instead of P2 corner takeover would be extremely powerful. Instead, white wasted a move.]
;B[no]SQ[pn][pr]C[My positioning of stones was attempting to "corral" white's clumped development while hopefully minimizing opportunities for white to "cut" my pieces off, something I seemingly have problems dealing with.

taw: It's a sensible move. Other sensible moves marked (Q6 probably the best of them).]
;W[ro]SQ[pn]C[taw; White still isn't taking advantage of the cut.]
;B[rn]C[taw: OK];W[oq]
(;B[op]SQ[pn][np][rp][nr]C[Here I played into atari, a foolish mistake. Thinking what I could have used this move for otherwise.

taw: Yeah, One of the marked squares would work a lot better.]
;W[np];B[qr]C[Aha! I must have been recollecting my thought processes. I most likely made this move for the same reasons I stated in the digressionary nodes.

taw: After white broke out, it's too late for it.];W[nn];B[mo]
C[White plays to cut out, but I have space to escape and continue my attack.]
;W[pn]C[taw: The cut white should have made ages ago, very painful even when late.]
;B[om];W[ae]C[Further defending of a solid group by white?

Was his group more attackable?];B[mp];W[nr];B[mq];W[op];B[pm]
;W[sn];B[sm]C[With the stone at R2, I feel that by closing off the outside liberties I can hope to play his interior and the side lines to the detriment of his group. R2 felt really nice because with its presence his group feels too stretched to form two eyes.]
;W[so]
(;B[rq]C[taw: This move cost black something like 100 points!!!]
;W[rm];B[qm];W[sl]C[I feel that this "double" atari into single capture wasn't that bad for me, considering I still had decent restriction of his liberties. Probably preventable with better attacking? I do not know.]
(;B[rl]C[taw: 100 point loss again!!!! White lost opportunity to protect S4 cut!]
;W[sm];B[rk]C[Escape stopped? White may have been able to play that to live, I feel, looking back.

taw: Third chance to play S4 and kill half of white's stone on board missed...]
;W[rp];B[pr];W[or];B[ps]C[At this point I know that I have his group dead because I have a live territory preventing his eyes.

taw: It is very much not dead. White escaping to the side is one way, but mostly white S1 kills your group.]
;W[mr];B[sq]C[Well, I say that, but then again, white could have escaped at M2?

taw: White M3 / M2 / S1 is worth 100 points or so.]
(;W[bc]C[But insteads threatens my corner in the upper left. This is a minor threat, but I feel an escape in the bottom right could translate into a good semicircle of territory from the upper left to the bottom right for white.

Is this correct reasoning?

taw: White made a ridiculous misplay.];B[lr];W[cd]C[Give up the stone to secure definitively the death of this group.]
;B[qq]C[Probably didn't need to play this stone right now, should have payed more attention to threat on other side of board.

taw: S1 would do much more to ensure you kill white for sure instead of just seki. (you'll kill white more likely than not anyway thanks to M2)]
;W[dc]C[Taking my corner.]
(;B[ed]TR[dd][de]SQ[ee]C[Connecting out, but weakly. This is submissive when I could perhaps play a bit more up and prevent a couple territories loss.

taw: There are very few exceptions to the rule that empty triangles are bad. E17 is much better local move. E4 on the other hand is worth way more.]
;W[ec]C[taw: "Best move for black is best move for white". White took E17 since black didn't.]
;B[gc]C[Trying to stem the tide.

taw: Reasonably thinking. E17 a few steps back would be better. E4 is a bigger tide to stem.]
;W[lq]
(;B[ns]C[Should have played this at M1. Would prevent the atari at 96 as well as provide the same killing power.

Although at about this point I think I start spending too much time locally on a dead group with little chance of escaping when I have areas I could fortify, perhaps in the H5'ish area.

taw: White picks up a nice fight. M2 needs urgent answer, and O2 it is not. You should have played  it at L3.]
;W[kr];B[ls];W[ms];B[jq];W[ks];B[os];W[lr];B[lp]C[Due to atari loss have to commit more stones to the same territory that I should have sewn up by now.]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[kp];B[kq];W[lo];B[mn];W[jp];B[iq];W[ln];B[nm]
;W[mm];B[is];W[kn]SQ[nn][rs]C[taw: S1 or O6. Both players keep ignoring them.]
;B[sk];W[ep]C[White smartly understands that we both have probably been spending too much time on the group, starts building a large territory that I have little chance of invading due to me focusing on making sure bottom right dies.

taw: Bottom right lives after O6. It either lives unconditionally or lives in sekis after S1 depending on following plays...]
;B[gp];W[fq];B[fp];W[ip];B[hq];W[hp];B[gq]C[I connect here, but I should punish white's attempted connection at perhaps F2?]
;W[fr];B[eo]C[Instead I just accept this wall and concede a large amount of territory.]
;W[go];B[fo];W[fl];B[ho];W[gn];B[gm]C[Futile attempts to hold onto this part of center. I feel if I played further away from white's strong groups, such as the 4 line, I would have a better chance at securing the area outside of my corner.]
;W[hn];B[sp];W[hm];B[pq];W[gl];B[js]SQ[nn]C[Going through the motions of killing this group, seems unneccessary. Meanwhile, white is creating a good pocket around K7 that creates territory as well as strangles my bottom left line.

taw: This is painful, white can O6 the whole time, even now.]
;W[fm];B[ls]C[This did feel good, but that shouldn't motivate my movements.]
;W[io];B[gj]C[Largely late center play to stop white developing his pocket, but white has already created it.]
;W[hj];B[fk];W[gk];B[fj];W[gi];B[ei];W[ll];B[mk];W[lk];B[lj]
;W[ml];B[nl]C[When establishing these "boundaries" of territory, I feel I am too complacent. It might be that I don't have the capacity to be more proactive however, because of my lack of establishing stones.

taw: After white's lack of O6 black is leading by 80-100 points or so. Time to close the remaining areas and count the score.]
;W[nk];B[mj];W[fi];B[ej];W[fh];B[fg]TR[hi][kj]SQ[jc][lc][nc]
[jd][lf][qf][lg][pg]C[taw: Recognize when your lead is so massive that you can let your opponent take some scraps and you'll win the game regardless. Marked squares quickly close a lot of territory leading to closer finish. You really don't care if white gets a few points. 


Or you could do something aggressive like marked triangles, but there's little reason to.]
;W[hi];B[kl]SQ[nc]C[Hard to imagine this stone will do much, as I can't attack the inevitable connection at M7. Should focus on area around K10?

taw: You should focus on finishing the game now. DOes it matter if you win by 100 points or 80 points? It's unnecessary greed that led you to waste a lot of stones fighting the center which you could use making your top side and top right corner completely unassailable.]
;W[kk];B[jn]C[Similarly, too far deep into territory I should concede because I made the mistake of not fortifying my position when I had the time.]
;W[km];B[jh]C[This move, like most of my establishing moves, too late. And perhaps still too complacent, K10 seems like it does the same job as this move, but better because it is further in. K10 is as defensible considering it is only a 1 jump from M10.]
;W[ih];B[ig];W[hg];B[gg];W[hh];B[hf];W[kj];B[jj];W[jk];B[ji]
;W[ki];B[kh];W[mi];B[nj];W[li];B[ni];W[lh];B[lg];W[jg];B[if]
;W[jf];B[hk]C[Here I start getting the idea that I can take on this group centered at H11. Thinking back, even if I could connect this stone with my group at K11, I am not really playing with enough liberties I think to be attacking a group which has 4 liberties itself.]
;W[ii]C[I mean, this could have been white playing J9, killing my attack.]
;B[eh];W[kg]C[And we see that my right border of attack was very weak itself, wedged between two large groups with barely any liberties.]
;B[gh];W[ij];B[ik];W[il];B[je];W[lf];B[mg];W[hl];B[kf]C[Trying to stop white's progression towards the top, I play these pieces diagonally, but they are very open to cuts, especially considering the stone at M14 has already been placed. Play into atari here.

The diagonal versus triples such as K13 seems like a losing proposition, asking to be cut.]
;W[ke];B[mh];W[ie];B[jd];W[he];B[gf];W[id];B[ic];W[jc];B[kd]
;W[ld];B[kc];W[ib]C[White starts a ladder here, but because I have the stone at G17, I can sort of punish.]
;B[jb];W[hc];B[jc];W[hd];B[hb];W[gd];B[fd];W[fc];B[ge]C[More symbolic than anything, because of my stones in upper left from beginning, white should not have extended as much into that direction. Upper right seems much more juicy (seems juicy from the start! I played no defense there!)]
;W[gb];B[ia];W[fb];B[ha]C[taw: All this fighting benefited white massively. Your lead is down from 90 points to 60 points or so - but you're still far ahead so just close the corner and gg.]
;W[ga];B[hd];W[le];B[mf];W[me];B[nf];W[ne];B[oe];W[lc];B[lb]
;W[mb];B[od];W[la]C[This march seemed really unstoppable to me. Could I have prevented white's progression at this moment? Or does it hearken back to me not paying attention to my corners at the beginning?

This sort of progression represents a lot of lost territory, I found.

taw: It's not about the beginning, it's about not picking up the fight in the center. The player who is behind (white) wants a huge fight just because it can. The player who is ahead (black) wants the game to end peacefully.]
;B[kb];W[ka];B[nb];W[ma];B[nc];W[mc];B[nd];W[kf];B[na];W[of]
C[Here is a cut invasion, I don't do well with defending invasions I think.]
;B[jh]C[No respect given to it! I should have played this at Q14! I cannot afford to give up much if any of my territory in top right, that is really my largest stake!]
;W[kh];B[nh];W[oh];B[pg]C[Damage control, but its already looking bad.]
;W[ph];B[og];W[oj];B[ok];W[qg];B[oi]C[Now white has a lot of freedom in dictating my liberties in my own territory. I try to minimize the impending damage.]

taw:

Closing remarks for this review:
* Pay attention to the board. There were something like twenty opportunities to play moves valued 100 points or more which both players missed. (like O6 and S4) and too many missed opportunities to play moves valued 20 points or more like E4 to even mention them all.
* Early game 3rd and 4th line are the way to go.
* Avoid empty triangle shape. It is almost never a good idea.
* When ahead, do not get into any unnecessary fights, just lock up your lead.
* Do not throw stones at fights which are unlikely to be profitable unless you're very far behind.

Have fun playing!])
