C[in this game I play white. As white I always have difficulties invading black framework.
I lost the game of 8,5 pts and I have always been back, because of some big mistakes in the beginning.

I'm more interested about comments on the beginning.



Review by Georg Mischler
"schorsch" on NNGS];B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[dj];W[fq];B[dn]
;W[ip];B[jd];W[cf]C[was it the good direction of play ?

schorsch:
There's one fundamental thing to say here first. If you played
your move 10 on Q10, and looked at the total board position, who
do you think would be ahead? B has a reinforced san-ren-sei,
plus one extension to K16. W would have a simple san-ren-sei,
plus a good position near the B stones. Hard to tell if one of the
players is ahead!

Many kyu players tend to overestimate the potential territory of
their opponent, and forget to look at what they have themselves.
If you overcome this reflex, then you'll find that there is no
reason for panic in the current game position for either player.

Now for the actual move: If you're playing low here, then you
should be prepared to live down there, while B takes the outside,
gaining huge influence. If you're satisfied with just reducing the
potential there (and you should!), then you will rather play on the
fourth line, so you have an easier escape.
The area of play as such is correct.];B[ce];W[df];B[fd];W[ch]
C[A bit too low, isn't it ? I wanted to play on the 3rd line to create a living space.

schorsch:
Creating a "living space" after this answer by B seems slightly
optimistic, even though may not be completely impossible.
But the goal here should be more than just to live. You want to
use this group to disturb the B side further, which for the moment
is reached best if you maintain a possibility to walk to the center.
If B manages to seal your group in here, then that means that your
stones don't participate in the rest of the game anymore. If you
walk out, then the same stones can influence the position in other
parts of the board as well, which is what you want them to do.

In short: Playing on the fourth line is much better in this situation.]
;B[cj];W[cc]C[too early, isn't it ? what was better ?

schorsch:
Yes, this is definitively early, as long as the star point on the other
side of the is still open, and your previous group doesn't really live
on its own yet. What you're doing right now is creating a second
weak group, which will influence the rest of the game even less
than the first one.

Most likely, you want to take a big jump towards the center from
your first group at this point. Note that in the actual game, B
anwers quite correctly, weakening the first W group even further
than it already is.];B[be];W[ec];B[ed];W[fc];B[dc];W[db];B[gc]
;W[gb];B[hb];W[fb];B[hc];W[bc]C[schorsch:
I'm not completely sure if this defense is necessary here.
This would require careful calculation for a definive answer,
but your shape looks fairly good, so W might want to consider
taking sente now.

This is not something to rely on in every situation, but if you
don't see an obvious way to kill your corner, then there are
chances that another player of similar strength won't either... ;)]
;B[gg]C[I feel bad now !...

schorsch:
And rightfully so!];W[gf]C[schorsch:
Playing your counter attack on the side where B is strongest
may not be the best idea...

My first reflex would say to play F12 instead. You *should* be
prepared to leave some stones behind in a tough situation,
but maybe not quite as many as in this example.];B[ff];W[fg]
;B[ef];W[gh];B[hg];W[eg];B[fh];W[fi];B[eh];W[ei];B[dg];W[di]
;B[cg];W[fk];B[qf];W[mc];B[qn];W[qj]C[was it good ? I didn't want to let the right side to white

schorsch:
You probably mean "to black"?
What you ended up with instead was to give the lower corner
and large parts of the bottom away, where you currently still have
an advantage. Playing the attaching joseki starting with Q6 would
fit very well into this position.

Remember that you can't prevent your opponent from getting
*something*. Just try to steer him to take those areas you're not
directly interested in yourself, and make as much profit along
the way as you can. If you manage to build up territory along the
bottom edge, then you can let B make some along the right without
getting upset about it.];B[np];W[oo]C[is this a good answer ?

schorsch:
This is the most peaceful answer possible.

If one of your groups is attacked from both sides, then it is a
typical strategy to attack one of them first by attaching, and to
deal with the other after that. The reason for this lies in the fact that
two fighting groups will always strengthen each other, especially
in "close combat".

For example, you could play Q6 here, expecting a B to reply of Q7,
which will strengthen both your corner group, and the B group
on the right side. You can use your stone at R10 as an ally, but
should treat it lightly, being prepared to sacrifice it at any time.
A few moves later, your now much stronger corner group will
have the single B stone at O4 between itself and another relatively
stable W group. And if you then find time to eg. play at M3, then
you shouldn't have any reason to complain about the result.

This principle is illustrated here:

;B[qq];W[qp]C[I have been wondering a lot what side I should close ...
can you give me some advice about this sequence, that I played badly

schorsch:
First of all, there should be no doubt that B will connect his stones
on one of the two sides, and live comfortably there. Once you accept
this, the remaining decisions become much simpler.

The main reason for chosing one or the other side should be where
you expect to make more territory yourself. Since the B stone on the
left is standing higher and is therefore harder to capture for this
purpose, your choice is probably correct.];B[pq];W[no];B[op]
;W[pn]C[schorsch:
This move is clearly wrong, as B could now connect *both*
sides to the corner. There is only Q5 in this situation.];B[rp]
;W[po];B[mo]C[schorsch:
For some reason, B wasn't interested in destroying the
W territory that is now building on the right side.
Either he didn't see the possibility (S6 is probably best),
or he was so worried about W getting a mojo in the center,
(which is still far away) that he chose to ignore it.];W[ro]
;B[rq];W[qo];B[qd];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pe];B[qe];W[oc]
;B[mn];W[lp];B[mp];W[lr]C[schorsch:
Just extending down to M3 is much more solid, and just as
effective.];B[oj];W[pk];B[pf];W[dr];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[bh]
C[schorsch:
This is a very small move, especially considering that B will
make considerable points in the center later on. Maybe putting
some pressure on the P10 stone would be a good idea now.];B[fn]
;W[cl]C[schorsch:
A massive overplay.
If B answers correctly, then W has no chance of keeping this
stone alive, given the weaknesses of the other W group nearby.]
;B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[bj]C[may be I should have played C7 ?]
;B[cm]C[schorsch:
Imagine this B stone at C11 instead, and virtually all of the left side
would belong to B. W might even have to allow the cut, in order to
at least live along the edge. Hunting season on the center W stones
then.];W[ci];B[bm];W[bk];B[go];W[gq];B[in];W[ik];B[hi];W[gi]
C[schorsch:
Saving a single W stone, but losing the connection to J9?
The correct answer would be G10, which also makes the
need to make an eye on the left edge much less urgent.];B[hj]
;W[ai];B[hk];W[bg];B[me]C[schorsch:
This move paves the path to Bs victory. After sealing in another
W group with H9, this play is very consequent by B, and secures
an unusual amount of center territory.];W[nl];B[mk];W[of];B[nf]
;W[oe];B[og]C[schorsch:
Knowing the end result: Wouldn't N8 be much more interesting
for B now? P13 *does* keep W from walking further there, but
then, the area where W can walk from there doesn't look like
potential B territory anyway...];W[ml];B[ll];W[lm];B[mm];W[nk]
;B[mj];W[nj];B[ni]C[schorsch:
If B had made a rough evaluation of the game now, then he'd
probably just continue nice and secure with N11.];W[lk];B[kl]
;W[mi];B[lj];W[li];B[kj]C[schorsch:
B could have reached more during the last few moves by
giving a little more way from the beginning. Pressing for
every single point creates too many cutting possibilities for W.]
;W[nh];B[oi];W[oh];B[ph];W[ng];B[pg];W[mf];B[ne];W[lg];B[ki]
;W[lh]C[may be M15 wa better ? I still get 3 black stones, and I invade his framework.

schorsch:
This would require some calculation. M15 lets you capture three
stones as well, but you'll have to give away the two at M11. On the
other hand, the B territory to the left will still be open, while in the
game, B could close it firmly by forcing the removal of P11.

Without really reading that much ahead, I think that I'd prefer M15.]
