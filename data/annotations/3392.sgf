C[   Thanks for the chance to comment this game. Please understand that no one except a higher ranking pro knows the truth about go. Some of my comments are only useful in that they stimulate you to think in more ways about the game and thereby get more enjoyment out of it.

   Please accept my useful comments and ignore my useless ones.

April 2004];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]C[Based on the first four stone placement: Black's story is a patient cash based game; White's story is power and fight picking.]
;B[oc];W[qj]C[W6: this wedging play is too slow. It allows black to make two shimaris. Instead Q5 would consistent with the two star white position on the left. R5 can never be labeled a bad move in this position even if some claim it not harmonious enough with White's two stars.]
;B[qh]C[B7: direction error. R6 is sente poushing White toward the strong black position top right while making another shimari.]
;W[po];B[oo]C[i was expecting a 2 space extension, 8 quite surprised me, so i played 9 to try to make 6 look wrongly placed - who does better up to 16?

Making R10 seem wrongly placed is a good idea. Lets see what will happen.]
;W[on];B[op];W[pm]C[W12: since R10 is already in place, White should consider the hard connection of Q6.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[ro]C[B15: now R10 is overconcentrated. At this moment, if White could magically pick up R10 and put it elsewhere, he would like that (i.e. move it to D10 or K17. This is a sign of something not being quite right in his position.)]
;W[mn];B[fc]C[B17: of course its a big point, but the bottom is urgent. Black should move out, to M3 for example.GUIDLINE: move the inside stones out is usually urgent.]

(;W[df]C[W18: could be C14 to take sente for M4 on the bottom.]
;B[jd];W[cj]C[this looks a little flat to me for white - all along the right hand side, so...

W20: locally C10 is the normal move. However, White must think how to make use of his position on the right. He is comitted to a central oriented,moyo, fighting game; while Black has clearly decided on cash. Therefore, I think W20 cannot be placed on the 3rd line.]
;B[fq]C[... i played 21 to take advantage of this. I suppose that 16 limits my ability to build terratory on the bottom but up to here i am quite happy

B21: in fact, when White has a stone on the 3rd line, usually he must answer the kikari with an extension to D6 because the 3rd  line stone is a commitment to the cash there. 

But you are correct in that Black cannot really develop the bottom. B21 is a reducing move.]
;W[hp]C[W22: But, white squeezes! The bottom is not interesting so this is probably wrong. (Again, if C10 were D10, different story.)

At this moment, Black needs to decide if he can get more benefit out of jumping to F5 and counter attacking the H4 stone later or taking the 3-3 cash offer. I don't clearly see a counter attack benefit because of N6, so I would jump right into the 3-3. Even though White will get a perfect wall, it is easy to later reduce white's moyo.]

(;B[cn]C[I don't like this move much - would it be better try to settle the 21 stone simply?

Yes, see previous comment. In theory B23 is somewhat of an overplay because it is three white stones locally against two black stones AND it is White's turn. I was curious enough to look it up in Kombillo and couldn't find the pattern (W C10,D4,H4 and black C6,F3) in over 2000 pro games. I guess those pros weren't creative enough to play a move like B23.]
;W[fp];B[cp]
(;W[cq]C[W26: D3 is conceivable here.];B[dq];W[co]C[W28: deciding to go for the outside. It's interesting with N6 sticking out there.]
;B[bp];W[do];B[bo];W[eq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[dm]
(;B[lq]C[B37: F15 is possibly an improvement since it reduces AND covers a weakness (H17).]
;W[ge];B[cc]C[now i've gone into both left hand corners

There are two proverbs that pertain to this:
  "Get all 4 corners and win."
  "Get all 4 corners and lose."
Proverbs are handy to clarify the situation, eh?];W[dc];B[db]
;W[cd]C[W42: okay because of C10 not being D10. Not okay because it is not a consistent story with the action on the bottom left and with N6. White should separate Black and develop a large scale assault on the weakened upper black stones. A large scale assault is White's best hope when White has power more than cash.]
;B[bb];W[bc];B[cb];W[hc];B[gc];W[hd];B[ej]SQ[gf][gg][gh][gi]
[hj][hk][hl][hm][hn][ho]TR[mn]C[too deep?

B49: Yes it is too deep. White is open around B7 and Black will likely get B16. 

The squares show the current doorline of the white moyo; moreover, N6 affects the doorline making it stronger. Therefore, I am guessing that K10 or J11 is a sufficient reduction at this moment which can not be caught.]
;W[gj]C[W50: Of course White must go all out to punish Black. Black is ahead in cash.]
;B[ck];W[dk];B[cl];W[dl];B[jg]C[B55: Nice looking move, helping a potentially weak stone (K16), reducing White, building up Black.]
;W[oe]C[W56: not sure this is necessary right now.]
(;B[nd]C[i don't think i play the next few moves very well - what alternatives are there?

B57: Is this the right direction? It says the top is most important, not the right. But the top is open due to H17. The R12 stone also needs help because if it is separated off it becomes a liability. So how about simply Q14? See variation.]

(;W[qe]C[W58: normally pushes at Q16 first. See variatiion.]

(;B[re]C[B59: plays into White's hand by giving White forcing moves in the local black zone. Instead, see Q16 variation.]
;W[rd];B[pe];W[qf];B[pf]
(;W[rf]C[W64: White may try Q16 because the ladder works. White missed a chance.]
;B[rc];W[se];B[qc];W[rh]C[Black is satisfied to see White grovel low.]
;B[qg];W[qi];B[ng]C[B71: Seems slack.  The two black stones, R13/R12 are not sufficiently important at this moment. Take sente.]
