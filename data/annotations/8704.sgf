RE[W+63.5]

C[Just  a game where I got beaten. He took powerful control of the center and bottom left corner and I really don't understand how it happened

Michael: Hi there, I'll be reviewing your game for you.  I'll try leave markers in the review so you can follow along linearly.  This is the first time I'm trying this, so let me know if it makes the review easy to read or not.  I've removed the comments from the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[pq]LB[np:D][op:B][nq:C][oq:A]C[Michael:  This is not the correct way to approach a 3-4 stone.  You will want to approach from one of the lettered spaces.  There are quite a few josekis to choose from for a 3-4.  I wouldn't suggest trying to memorize them all quite yet.  But you might want to look up a few, just be careful not to slavishly follow them.]
;W[pp];B[oq];W[op]C[I kind of got lost as to what to do here

Michael: That's because you approached too closely.  See variation on this move.  You played away too early.

----

Michael: But moreover, even if you could play away the correct move in this case would be to reinforce your upper left.  The correct order is:

1. Playing in response to issues (things that are too good to pass up or to let happen, i.e. I have a wall and can use it to attack or extend from).
2. When your 3-3 or 4-4 stone is approached, respond (unless something else is urgent).
3. Playing in empty corners.
4. Playing in unfinished corners (single stones on the 3-4, 3-5 and 5-4 are unfinished corners)
5. Start a joseki in a “2 stone finished” corner that is to your advantage.
6. Approaching the 3-3 or 4-4 stone.
7. Sides.
8. Center.

If you take anything away from this review, I hope it's that list.  Continue on main line.]
(;B[fq]C[Michael: If this were me playing, I would ignore the approach and immediately hane black's two stones.  It's the urgent move.  See variation.]
(;W[hq];B[cn];W[er];B[fo]LB[do:B][fr:A]TR[hq][er]SQ[cn]C[Thought I had this corner sewed up with this little box

Michael: A couple of things you might be missing.  White is connected under by playing at A.  And white can (but shouldn't try immediately) cut black by playing at B.  (See variation.)

----

These are two good patterns to keep in mind.  Large knight on the 2nd to 3rd line is connected in most cases.  Anywhere else it can be cut.  Continue.]
(;W[fr];B[dc]LB[ec:A][fc:D][ed:B][fd:C]C[Michael:  When you enclose a 3-4 corner, you'll want to play the same sort of moves that you play to approach one.  A-D.]

;W[je];B[jd];W[ie];B[ke]LB[kd:A]C[Michael: No reason to leave a cutting point.  Just play at A.  A also heavily threatens whites base.  Black is now very strong in this area.  So A is also sente.]

;B[gc];W[jb]LB[jf:A]TR[hc]C[In this situation I would personally just take the marked stone.  It removes aji, and you still have a very weak white group to harass.

You should also remember A.  It's sente on white's three stones and it ruins white's shape.]

;W[fg]
(;B[fi]LB[ck:A]C[Aggressive!  White's stones are under a heavy attack.  You're developing the marked area.  You can also consider a move like D13 to develop the corner.  Either way it attacking, but here's an interesting distinction (see variation).

----

In this case you're pushing white into your territory.  Which is ok if white dies.  But it's very hard to kill a group when playing Go.  You shouldn't count on it unless you know you can.  See variation on next move.]
(;W[hi];B[fl];W[hl]LB[np:A]C[I let him trap me in with these little moves. I know that I am too timid with moving into the center but I just can't seem to figure out when to do it.

Michael:  On the contrary.  You're currently winning this game and you're far from trapped in.  White had any number of ways his shape can be exploited.

I can't belive though, that the game's gotten this far without addressing the bottom right.  Did you just give it up for dead?]

Looks like I forgot to say Goodbye or good game. I'll be more polite next time. Thanks for the review.

Michael:  No problem.  There's a lot to unpack in a review like this.  A few thoughts.

At the level you seem to be playing at, I would concentrate less on strategy or attack and defense or anything high minded like that, and more on things like fighting.  Play a few 9x9s or 13x13s until fighting comes more naturally to you and you can start thinking about whole board.  Get the basics of the opening down, of course.  But beyond that, just plink down stones (for now) and working on your fighting until it becomes instinctual.

You seem to follow your opponent around the board a lot.  Try to break out of that habit.]
