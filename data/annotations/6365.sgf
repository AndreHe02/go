Koori [9k\]: hi gg

Hello, I am asking for this review because I felt ahead
in this game but I still lost. I think this was because of
my mistakes in the endgame. I would very much
appreciate it if you would show me what I did wrong
and most importantly how I can improve.

Thanks in advance.

(review for white)


FishGo:Hi, I am happy to review this game for you, this is also my first ever gtl review.]
;B[po];W[jj]C[I have been doing some research into the opening
on tengen. The previous game I played my opponent
used it (as black) and I won. So for this game I thought
it interesting to try opening on tengen. This is my first
game using tengen as a first move. I am very much
interested in any thoughts on the use of tengen.

FishGo: Opening at tengen as white is very rare, but, why not?  No one can say if it's a good move or bad move.  One thing to keep in mind is, if you play tengen at the beginning you have to follow up with moves that works with the tengen.]
;B[ce];W[dp];B[qd];W[od]C[From what I have read tengen is not usually played as
white since it gives black three corners. Here I thought
there was a possibility to invade the corners so it looked
balanced to me.];B[oc]LB[nc:B][pd:A]TR[po]C[FishGo: A is joseki but the direction is questionable because of the high stone marked, it can lead to the very complex avalanche joseki.  B is also possible.]

(;W[pd];B[pc];W[qe]LB[nc:C][rc:A][nd:B][re:D]C[FishGo: A seems a little slow.  B will lead to the small avalanche joseki, C will lead to the big avalanche joseki.  D is a move that is played when black wants to avoid the avalanche shape.]

(;B[rc]LB[qc:A][rd:B]C[FishGo:  Black is better off playing at A or B.]
;W[rd]C[FishGo: This atari is the reason why.];B[qc]LB[nd:B]
[re:A]C[FishGo: Connceting at A is rather slow.  B is urgent for both.]

(;W[re];B[qk]LB[nd:A]C[Black plays this to protect the right side now white has
influence in that direction.

FishGo: This move is fine but as I said in previous variations white's influence is not so great, A is still an urgent place.]
;W[qm]C[I thought of invading here to turn the game into a
large scale fight. Since tengen limits the outside
influence of black this should be OK.

FishGo: I think it is a bit early];B[pm];W[ql];B[pl];W[rk]LB[qn:A]
C[FishGo: Black is better off responding at A.  Ladder is good for black. One of the reasons why O16 is important.(see variation)]

(;B[qj];W[qo]LB[pn:D][qn:B][pp:C][qp:A]C[FishGo:  Black has plenty of choices here, I think B is the most reasonable.]

(;B[qq];W[rl]LB[rq:A]C[FishGo: Perhaps better at A.];B[rq]LB[ro:A]
[sp:B]C[FishGo: A does not work, white needs to play B to live.]

(;W[ro]C[This looks like a nice life and death problem.

FishGo: White dies unconditionally here.]

;W[nn];B[oo]
(;W[ml]LB[oj:B][mm:A][kn:D][no:C]C[FishGo: Perhaps this hane is too much because the cut at A is surprisingly severe.  Even if black defends at B white has no good continuation.  C is not good either because black bottom group is safe.  I would jump out around D]

;W[fd]C[FishGo: This move is unusal.];B[dc];W[dd]C[FishGo: This kind of move is usually not desirable because it stregthens black's corner and moves aji.]
;B[cd];W[ec]LB[de:A]C[FishGo: Atari at A would be painful for white, black can choose to play it anytime.]
;B[jc]LB[db:A][cc:B][nd:C]C[FishGo: A bit too hasty, normally one would defend at A or B.  C is still a good point.]
;W[mc]LB[md:A]C[FishGo: Overplay.  One space jump at A is as far you can go.]

;W[mq]C[FishGo: White got lucky again.]
(;B[dq]LB[ck:B][ik:A]C[FishGo: Let's look at the board right now.  White: 15 combined top +top left; around 10 top right + centre group; 11 bottom group; 6 group on the right so, about 42 points and it's white's turn to play.  Black: 22 in the central group; around 5 bottom right corner; around 5 points with the group on the left; 5-6 points on top right corner because white has a yose move at P19. 37 points in total.  

FishGo: In my opinion, White is comfortably ahead in territory.  Two points to be aware of is A, black can still pull out at anytime, B remains an important point for both.  Black's move at D3 is quite active, white has to answer carefully to avoid trouble.]

(;W[gq]LB[cp:A]C[FishGo:  This answer is way too passive, black should hane at A and take the corner.  Answering at A is one way. (see variation)]

I believe I lost because of losing the K10 and D10 groups.

FishGo: Nice game.  Well, in Go it's hard to point at a specific place where you lost the game.  Both sides made mistakes in fights but black seemed to have more of those.  Black played solidly and had a couple chance to put the game in the pocket in early-mid game.  Your adventurous moves early on left a lot of bad aji and some of them came back to hurt you late in the game.  I think you can improve your opening by paying more attention to your direction of play, especially before starting josekis and invasions.  Later in the game you need to be aware of the bad aji or your opponent or your own.

Good luck!])
