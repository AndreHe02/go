C[Hi,
In this game, I played as black and ended up losing by 11.5 points. I feel the loss came from not handling the bottom side well in the opening, my opponent ended up with a large chunk of territory there.  Any comments would be helpful.

Thanks

A: I'll prefix my comments with A: so you'll know it's me.

A: Ok, I've put comments throughout the game, but here is my overall summary.

1. You didn't play badly.  Most of the spots where you were uncertain, I was too.  I've said stuff, but your moves were good.  We make tradeoffs and usually they are fair.  The game was territorially close throughout, so most of the big strategic decisions you made did not cost you the game.

2. Some late middle game/early end game decisions appear to me to have cost you the game.  Ask yourself as you play, are there sente moves that hurt him, but also profit me and protect my groups.  If you are playing territorially, then you may want to prefer that kind of move to moves in the center or moves that only reduce.  Of course, moves like that don't always exist. But always ask yourself if they do and look for them.  You might have seen J3 or R2 and I think those would have won you the game.

3. The late fighting in the middle I did not analyze thoroughly, but usually that kind of fighting winds up with nobody gets any territory.  A good double sente move at the edge is just better. Meat and potatoes move, not so much sun-dried tomato aioli.  Learn your basic endgame ideas and apply them every move.  G2 was such a move.

I hope this is of value.];B[dp];W[pp];B[dc];W[pd];B[nc];W[jd]
C[Does this pincer exist?  I wasn't really sure about what to do here.

A: Sure, this pincer exists.  After all, your opponent played it.  If it didn't exist before, it does now. ;-)  I dare say it is not commonly played. (A quick glance in a joseki book and I can't find it.)  But it is a pincer.  It's characteristics are that it is high and distant.  If you don't mind white getting a position on the right, you could jump out quickly with O14. Since your opening is more territoryish, though, R17 is an option, though that lets white work well with Q4 stone.  It may be that a double approach is not good with K16, but I guess I'm not good enough to know that for sure.

A: I just plugged it into SmartGo, and it is played in a lot of games in there, 109 to be exact.  The way you handled it is not that different than a couple of those games.  You got a good corner and some territory and the moves seem to make sense most of the time ... until my next comment.]
;B[qf];W[oe];B[qc]C[Is entering san-san here ok?  I ended up with some nice territory, but I'm not sure if the influence he got in exchange was worth it.

A: I think the exchange was fair.  You are not going to get everything. You got territory and a solid group to work with.  You are right to be concerned about his outside influence, but you can't prevent him from getting some entirely.  If you think he is getting the better of it after a certain point, then stop the pattern and do something else.  At this stage, though, the moves are almost automatic.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[pf];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc]C[A: Here is a place where I might part company.  R13 is numerically quite big, but you already have your corner and the white outside influence is limited.  From here on out, as you develop on the right, you get 3 or 4 points a move and his wall gets longer and thicker.  If you stop here, he can block you into the corner, but the right side is not that developable for black anyway, with the Q4 stone sitting there. If you stop now, you can take some big moves elsewhere and he needs to make more moves to profit from his thickness.  M15 might be a way of erasing some of the influence.  He could chase it a turn or two, but he can't kill it and N16 becomes important for him soon, giving you sente.]

(;B[qg];W[pg];B[ph];W[oh]
(;B[pi]C[A: Here is another place where I might part company.  I don't think Q12 was right here.  It is big numerically, but from here on out, pushing along the right is limited in value for you by Q4, and his wall is starting to be too much and too thick.  You got your corner, but the right side is not much further developable.

You have a few choices. If you want to keep squeezing what you can out of the right, double hane (variation A).  That at least brings an end to his wall and keeps his star point stone by itself for the time being.  Also moves you into the center and makes what you have on the right more valuable.  Another option is to tenuki before 21 and take a big point somewhere else.  True, he can push you around there, but how much?]
;W[oi];B[nq]C[A: Having played at Q11, maybe you need to hane again to make use of it.  Later, he double hanes to good effect.  O3 does work with D4 and the bottom is theoretically developable for black. But playing tenuki now I think means the exchange of the last few moves was good for white.  Something like M15 harder to play now.

A: All this advice I'm giving, take with a grain of salt so far. I am very uncertain about it.  Like you, at each key point I have been ambivalent.]
;W[jp]C[Here's that pincer again...

A: I think we may now say this pincer exists!]
(;B[qn]C[A: I think this isn't right.  The idea of a double approach like this is to get value on one side or the other, but white gets to choose the direction.  Black gets profit on the right that has already been paid for, and isn't wholly secure because of the hane at Q10.  In exchange O3 is cut off.  

I tried a variation diving into the corner.  White can't play R4 direction, building a useless wall, so he goes q3 direction. The resulting corner is valuable, but white still gets outside. Black has sente from it and can P10 hane, but it only seems a tiny bit better than what you got.

All this may point to not approaching this corner.  Maybe K3 or K4 is the better move instead of O3.]
;W[oo];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[pj]C[A: Painful.  But white lets you out in the end.]
;B[qj];W[qi];B[qh];W[qk];B[rj];W[pk];B[rk]
(;W[qm]C[A: This move was a gift to you.  Reduces your right, but lets your group out.  In a game where white is trading away whole estates to build influence, that is a bad idea.  Instead of R7, consider white Q7.  (Variation)  Big long white wall.  Very ugly.]
;B[pn];W[on];B[pm];W[rl];B[pl];W[ql];B[nl];W[nk];B[ml];W[ln]
C[A: Excellent sequence.  Black must get out.];B[mn]C[A: I think this sequence is premature.  You don't break through and end up guaranteeing white this area and making him stronger. At the very least, leave that till later to use as ko threats. O3 has aji and you don't need to burn it off now.  Later on, unorthodox attacks at L5 or k2 might be possible, relying on O3 being there...]
;W[mo];B[po];W[op];B[nn];W[mp]C[Maybe this exchange wasn't as good as I thought for black, white's almost solidified a lot of territory on the bottom.

A: ... now attacking the bottom is not possible.  Your suspicion is correct, I think.]
;B[mk];W[nj]C[A: N9 very big and worth it reducing value of big white wall. At this stage, although K17 worked out well, I think you could keep in mind the proverb about "reduce your opponent's moyo gently." It's not really a moyo, it's just a big wall, but see variation for another sequence that reduces the value of his area gently while building up the strength of your positions.  K17 can work out really well or really badly, but you are not behind and white's top is not a desperate crisis for you yet.]

(;B[jc]C[This attachment is a bit unorthodox I guess, but it worked out ok.]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[kc];B[jb];W[ld];B[hc];W[id];B[kb];W[hd];B[gc]
;W[lb]C[A: Ok, you reduced some and profited some and M10 reduces the value even more.  Not bad.  There may be better, but I can't really argue with it.  I think M11 might be possible too and worth more, but it is complicated.]

(;B[lj];W[lh];B[fq]C[Maybe I should've been a bit more aggressive with this move, or rather I could've taken the left star point or maybe even C11 or D11 for the chinese fuseki shape.

A: This move and all your suggested moves are fine.  Psychologically, I wouldn't refer to it as a "fuseki" at this stage, given the troop-clogged entrenchments stretching across the already mature area of operations on the right, but something around the star point might be good.  I think F3 might be the best here and might, to the experienced eye, be miai with C15.

Keep in mind, you aren't losing yet.  This game was winnable and I think endgame is where the biggest difference came.  You are still developing and reducing and all your suggested moves are good for that.  The reason I say F3 might be best is I hate the idea of white g3, but even then, exchanging white g3 for, say, c10 and c15, might be great.]
;W[ce]C[A: This inaugurates what I think was a lousy sequence for you. At this stage of the game, you are in a position to get profit in lower left and left area, whereas he is somewhat restricted to profiting in the center.  It is a good gamble that you can stop him getting lots of territory in the center.  M10 is there, F15 is there, if you play on D10, he can't kill it.  All those can reduce the center already.  This sequence gives you a wall facing the center.  The most that can do is reduce his territory, but you already could do that.  Meanwhile, it gives him profit on the left and reduces your potential territory on the left and top.  

You are playing a territory type game, and there is not so much of the middle game left anyway.  I would say C11 here.  Attack that stone and make it run toward the wall or live small in the corner.  meanwhile, you can get extra territory in the lower left.

See the variation.  It may be that I had white a bit too compliant, but you get the idea.]

(;B[df]C[A: This move attacks C15, but also touches it.  "Touch a weak stone; make it stronger."  A proverb that can more succinctly be stated as "Don't touch a weak stone."  Attack it, but from the right distance.  Like several strong men attacking an angry dog ... they don't do it by wrestling with the dog and risking bites ... they do it with long sticks and nets and they do it slowly.]

;W[bh];B[ci];W[bi]
(;B[cb]C[Maybe C10? White crawling on the second line was bad for him.

A: Yes.  Having decide to build a wall toward the center and having convinced white to crawl along the second line, proverbially the line of death, maybe better to keep at it.  You probably could have gotten some profit there toward the center, though not a lot.  Also, consider that at some point, you can hane down to the second line, since you are ahead by one move, and enclose some territory toward your still incomplete corner in the lower left.  The possibility may force white to keep crawling, in which case you could C18 later.  See variations.  They all seem to be most excellent for black.  Plus, letting white hane here means he's turning your wall the way you turned his at N9, which is big.

Of course, C18 is big as heck.  Bad timing maybe, but big.]
;W[cj];B[eg];W[ff];B[ef];W[cn]C[A: His left is worth more than your wall, and C6 damages your territorial prospects.]
;B[cl]C[A: I don't think this changed much.  Hard to kill C6 and now you have a weak stone to nurse.  This is a complicated fight that damages your territory more than his.]

C[A: A territory move.  Now you are back on track];W[bo]
(;B[bc]C[A: A big, big move, but gote.  I think you have much bigger fish to fry in sente.  You were right not to consider C4 a priority. J3, I think, is your move here.  Also R2.  R2 is a twofer, big defense of your still slightly vulnerable corner and big sente reduction of whites bottom, using aji of O3.  White must answer. See variations.]
;W[cp]C[A: White uses sente];B[cq];W[co];B[bq]C[Was B3 necessary? I played it to be safe, but maybe I should've grabbed a bigger move.]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[pr];B[ro]C[A: R2 not only taken by white, but now you had to give sente up again to defend group]
;W[rs];B[sr];W[om];B[ol];W[rn];B[lm];W[kn]C[A: White is pushing you around here.  White is slightly ahead in territory, but you can still win this in endgame, but you have to be watching your sente.  The sole purpose of your lower right group is to live and occupy white space.  Think of it as a tapeworm.  There is no danger of it losing access to the center. There is no prospect of it winning significant territory.  Your only concern is, will it live.  Because of the R2 situation, it only has one eye in the corner, and I'm worried by L8.  I haven't read it out carefully, but I think L7 might be a necessary move.  Maybe we should read it out carefully because, if you move at L7 to secure the group, then white has no business moving at K6.  That is a bad move.  White needs seriously to play H3, at which point it is much harder for you to win the game.  Therefore, only move at L7 if completely necessary for group to live.  Otherwise, you grab H3 or J3. 

So, let's try...

... variation indicates black could live, but boy would it be hard to read.  Maybe L7 was vital.]

(;B[km];W[jn]C[A: Very hard to kill black now.  (Enjoy the ladder problem!) So black must play J3.  If you had played J3 here, then white K6 would have been the losing move.]

(;B[jm]C[A: Instead, black K7 was the losing move.];W[hq]C[Here's my dilemma with white's bottom territory. I didn't know what to do about it, but I had the top to worry about too.

A: Too late.  White got the big move.  You would have gotten the big move if you had secured the lower right with a profit earlier.  These big endgame moves are just that ... big and endgame. Hard to remedy once lost.  
The game is not over, but you are behind and no group life is in play, so you just have to do endgame perfectly.]
;B[be];W[bf];B[cd]C[A: Big, but gote.  G2 is huge in comparison, because of the follow up at j2 and because it is double sente.]

;W[hl];B[im];W[fm]C[A: Not sure of the value of these moves.  I would be looking to guarantee that the center produced not profit for white and maybe some for black.]

(;B[io]C[A: Two point gote-no-sente.  Something, but not a lot.]
;W[ip];B[jo];W[ko];B[kq]C[A: Bold thinking.  More than worth thinking out or trying out, since you are behind.  It doesn't work, but what the hey.]
;W[in];B[ho];W[kp];B[hm];W[gm]C[A: A puzzling move from white.  Separates two strong groups and leaves a horrible cut.  White just has to G8 and win the won game.]
