C[Hi,
 my Go name is KlinGo (on KGS). I am presently "around 10 kyu" according to the server, still at present time I don't rely very much on their grade system: in a single month I passed from 8 to 13 kyu within few games and back again (also due to infrequent play).

Please review this game, I was Black:  even thought I won, I was far behind in the middle game (around 100th move), then some lucky attacks and a "strange" invasion in the corner that my opponent was not able to block led to a winning: in the end I felt it quite a stolen result.

Help me especially about fuseki and middle game. In the endgame both me and White have not been very lucid and made several mistakes and misreads.

I will prefix my words with ">< K ><" in the following.
Many thanks for the work :)

Klingo];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc]C[>< K >< as I said this is my usual fuseki, menacing to make 2 shimaris.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[qj]C[>< K >< this is my favorite variation "out of joseki" meaning to realize (treaten) a big moyo on the upper right corner.]

(;W[nq];B[op];W[np];B[oo];W[rk];B[rj];W[qk];B[pk]C[This is the beginning of a questionable fixation on the white group on the side.    Many HUGE points are available elsewhere.  It's not worthwhile to spend your sente reducing this group by a few points, and with all the running room, it's very unlikely you can kill it.

The white group is a little unstable, but the way to use this is to play elsewhere, and force white to make more conservative moves in order to protect the white group's options.]
;W[pl];B[ok];W[jp]C[White scores a big gain from black's wasted sente]
;B[pp]C[unnecessary, white can never play here.];W[nm];B[pn]

;W[ol];B[on];W[nk];B[nj]
(;W[gq]C[>< K >< how do you evaluate this White move? White does not defend from Black leaning attack.
>< K >< Still it is very solid and creates territory in the lower left.

White side group still escapes easily.  Black has wasted at least 3 sente moves trying to attack it.]
;B[mk];W[nl];B[mi];W[co]LB[cn:A]C[>< K >< now the corner is well closed. Maybe A was better than C5?

A would leave the corner still open.];B[fe]C[Not terrible but not great either.  Something like C8 would be more effective at shrinking white's massive territory.]

C[>< K >< is this invasion an overplay?];W[dq];B[bp]C[this corner is being misplayed, black shouldn't survive, but considering your ranks, it's understandable.  The key point in these fights is almost always the 2-2 point.]

KlinGo [9k?\]: thanks

The outcome really came down to one huge mistake, but not unique among lots of smaller errors.   The overall game is flawed by overattention to small tactical moves rather than large, long term moves.]
