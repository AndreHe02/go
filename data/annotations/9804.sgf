AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi,
I'm Neil, I play as neil.howie on OGS and neilh23 on a few others.

You played pretty well in general, your main mistakes were letting white get too much on the left hand side, and blocked in the wrong side near the end giving away a lot of points on the bottom.

I think in general Your game would improve if you stop occasionally and look for all of the big points on the board, and which areas have the move potential.]
PL[W];W[qf];B[nc]C[This is OK, but I think O17 works best with the other stones]
;W[qn]
(;B[ql]C[Too close, if you want to split R14 and R6, then Playing Q10 is better.]
;W[on]C[Now you have to decide between defending the corner or R8]

(;B[qi];W[of];B[np]C[Good];W[pk]
(;B[qp]C[Too slow - you should keep your stones on the right hand side together!

At the moment, white has little to gain from jumping into the corner, so defending can wait]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[pl];B[qk];W[lq]
(;B[mr]C[I'd consider a pincer here, your stones shouldn't die, and it works as an extension of D4]
;W[fq]
(;B[iq]C[This is quite an aggresive move - I like it, but maybe not the best idea in a handicap game.]
;W[cq]C[If I were white, I'd play C6, which works with the stone at C14.]
;B[dq];W[cp]
(;B[co]C[Joseki mistake! See variation];W[do];B[eo];W[dn]
(;B[fp]C[Mistake - allows white D2 - I'd play C2 here];W[dr]
;B[en];W[dm]
(;B[jd]C[This seems to follow the proverb "when in doubt, tenuki".
It's a big point, but a bit slow and passive.

If you're looking for big points, Q10 glares out as a nice one.

I think the left hand side is starting to look too nice for white, so trying to split it here would be a good idea, C12 seems to work.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[ci]C[Allowing white this was bad!]
(;B[lo]C[It's hard to complete swallow this white stone and the placement of this feels awkward.

Q10 still looks like a nice point, see variations for other playable moves I'd consider.]

(;B[pf]C[interesting idea, but I'd probably just play S14 or try and seal with N14 - white's influence doesn't really do much here]

(;B[fm]C[Doesn't do a lot - black's potential here isn't great because of the stones underneath. E14 looks big to me]

(;B[gl]C[I think this is overplay]
(;W[fk]C[white should have cut at G7]
