RE[W+34.5]

;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[oc];W[cn]C[something around R10 is urgent for white because that is the ideal extension from black's corner enclosure]
;B[lq]C[Q: Is this move a bit overconfident?

R10 is very big.  Moves in bigger spaces are generally bigger.  In this case, R10 is the biggest (K17, C11 and K3 being the other options) because of black's corner enclosure.]
;W[pn]C[Q: What about R8?

R8 is too close to the Q4 stone.  R10 is ideal because white can then make a two point extension on whichever side black doesn't play.]
;B[pj]C[Q: Is this move a bit too defensive, isn't it? Two point closer at Q8 were better double pincer.

Not defensive at all.  Plays VERY well with the corner enclosure.]
;W[pk];B[jp]C[Q: Did this move achieved anything at all?

No.  R10 or R9 seem right to me.];W[nc]C[This move was ignored. Q: Was it a good move?

There is a proverb that says to attack at a distance and defend with contact.  This move violates that proverb.  R10 looks good for white.]
;B[gq]C[Q: Is this extension efficient enough? Is this direction of play correct?

I prefer F3 for a move in this area of the board.  O17 is also very strong.]
;W[ko]C[There is a proverb that says "Corners, then sides, then center."  The top and left sides are still very much open, so this move is premature.]
;B[mp];W[dh]C[Seems quite efficient.

C11 seems better to me, but this move is okay.  The o17 stone is still bothering me, however.  P16 now?]
;B[kc]C[This may be better than the O16 suggestion I made earlier.  Nice move.]
;W[ic]C[This seems to build both territory and influence.

I think it's an overplay.  Black can play F17, leaving this stone very weak.  G16 seems better.]
;B[jb]C[This move is small at this point in the game.  Later, it will be big.  Played too early.]
;W[jd];B[mb]C[Q: Is it too defensive?

Yes.  L16 is simple and strong.];W[mc];B[nb];W[ld]
(;B[pf]C[Q: Defensive?

I still like L16 for back here. See variation.];W[hg]C[Black can still play F17 , C14 or C17.  K12 seems a better play if going into the center.]
;B[ii];W[jk];B[kh]C[None of these center moves should be played before top-left, bottom-left and bottom-right are settled.]
;W[kg];B[mg];W[mf];B[ig]C[Q: Is this move too week?];W[jf];B[if]
;W[ie];B[hh];W[gg];B[gh];W[hf]C[Q: Was this move really necessary?

None of these moves are necessary, for either side.  You're fighting over nothing.]
;B[eh];W[eg];B[cc]C[Q: Is timing ok?

Yes.  Black lives in the corner and white gains influence in an area where white is already strong.  This is very good for black.]
;W[dc];B[cd]C[It seems not to be a big point.

This move is essential for black to live.  Absolutely urgent move.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[mn]C[The corner is incomplete!  D18 necessary.]

;W[jn];B[ln];W[hn];B[io];W[jo];B[hk];W[gk];B[ej];W[dj];B[el]
;W[dl];B[en]C[Q: Is this move strong enough?

Stay away from the center until the corners and sides are settled.  C3 would be good for black.]
;W[ek]C[The move seems to be inefficient.

Looks good to me.  Creates weaknesses in the black shape.];B[fk]
;W[dk];B[fl];W[ei];B[fj];W[fh]C[Small.  R3 or E3, perhaps.  Or C18.]
;B[fi];W[fq];B[fp]C[Black C3 lives.];W[kj];B[ki]C[M11];W[mj]
;B[li];W[oj];B[ni]C[R10];W[pi];B[mi]C[Very small.  C3 still lives.  R6 or R12 both much bigger.  H18 actually quite big as well.]
;W[mk];B[oi];W[qj];B[ph];W[qh];B[pg];W[of];B[og];W[ng]C[Very small.]

;B[gm];W[hj];B[ij];W[ik];B[kl];W[jm];B[db]C[This is good move, in general.  Not sure about the timing.  Since neither player wanted to finish the corner, why now?  L9 looks like it kills 12 white stones.]
;W[eb];B[da];W[ea];B[bb];W[fc];B[ho]C[Not needed.  This stone isn't a threat.]
;W[gr];B[fr]C[Wrong attack.  This only kills one stone and gives white a big corner.  Better to play C3 directly or atari with E3 and threaten the corner at the same time as killing both white stones.]

This is fine.];W[ah]C[Overplay.  See variation on next move.]

Result: W+34.5

The main proverb I suggest you both learn from at this stage in your go development is "Corners, then sides, then center."  White made a huge amount of territory on the left side without ever being challenged by black.  Without that snapback in the middle the game result might have been different, but either way, neither player should have been fighting in the center so early.  Notice the board right now.  How much territory did either player get in the center?  No much, especially compared to the corners and sides.  Take that to heart.]
