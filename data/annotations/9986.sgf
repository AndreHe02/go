-----------
Thank you for reviewing the game! I added some questions and some alternatives that I thought about during the game. Looking forward to your comments.

P: Hi! I hope you find this review helpful. I've marked my comments with P. If I could single out two things you should focus on, it would be 1) thinking about how you will profit from invading stones (as opposed to killing them) and 2) making meaningful moves in the midgame. It's easy to follow the opponents lead or just view things locally after the board has been divided between players, but its precisely at this time that one should slow down and consider a wide range of options and their proper order (i.e. whether or not they are sente). A good rule of thumb: always choose moves on the basis of a comparison, and not just on whether or not it is does something. If you just playing a move because it does something, and not because it is better than a number of other, identifiable moves, you are playing too quickly. - Paul]

(;W[cd];B[jq]C[P: great. also, r5 is still a good idea];W[dg]
C[P: this feels slow to me]
(;B[cl]C[How do you judge the position at this point? What would be your plan now as black?

P: I think the options you selected - c8 r4 and g4 - show you thinking too small. White at d13 felt slow to me, but by playing at c8 you've made that (rather solid) move better. White does not need to play locally and can turn their attention elsewhere.

What is important right now? I would say: your two groups at m17 and r14. they could easily come under attack. On the other hand, so could the white group at r6, so you should use that to your advantage. c8 becomes an even stronger move if you have a stone around p6, so why not hold it in reserve and come back to it (or not) later. Also, a white extension at c7 isn't sente.]

(;W[ej]C[P: slow. how much more territory does white think it is going to make on the upper left? perhaps a significant amount if they can attack black's j17 group from the left, but I don't think this is a good move. you can feel relieved when your opponent plays like this.]

(;B[qp];W[fl]C[P: wrong direction. the group at r9 is coming under pressure. better to play at p6 and think about pressing down at j4 later]

(;B[he]C[P: I understand the thinking behind this, but it doesn't feel quite right to me. j15 is more solid.]

(;B[jd]C[P: j16 is better.]
(;W[gq]
(;B[go]C[Do not touch. Threatens to cut.
Alternatives? Should white die here?

P: It's hard to kill invading stones, and you only have to win by one point. In this situation your goal should be to chase the stone out and gain an advantage elsewhere on the board in the meantime.]
;W[fo]
(;B[gp]C[this move is almost always incorrect, since you allow your opponent to hane at the head of two stones.]

;B[ip];W[jp]
(;B[ho];W[jr];B[ir]C[I never know what to do in such chaotic situations like here since move 34.

P: Your aim should rarely be to kill the invading stones. Rather, you want to deny the stones a base and force them to flee. In this particular game, you should be aiming to severely attack the two white stones on the right side.]
;W[jo]
(;B[lo]C[Here the plan was to let white live but build influence towards center. Then lean on R6 for even more influence.]
;W[nr]
(;B[mr]C[mistake];W[mq];B[nq]
(;W[or]C[P: this is an overplay. Sometimes when we make mistakes we begin to play carelessly. I wonder if that happened here. Your opponent gives you many opportunities in this fight, but you follow their lead closely, a sign of playing too quickly.]

(;B[pr];W[mp];B[mo];W[kp]C[This move makes no sense. White has basically passed.]

(;B[lp]C[P: You should never do this. Of course white will connect, and now your wonderful move at m2 has disappeared. Do not play moves you do not have to, they might close doors you didn't know were there.]
;W[lq];B[oq];W[lr]
(;B[on];W[om]
(;B[nm];W[nn];B[mn];W[nl];B[no];W[ol]C[P: a bad result for black. white gets out easily and the black stones at r11 might come under attack later.]
;B[jm]C[what does this stone do? at best: seal in an already living group.]

C[good];W[en]
(;B[ep];W[dm];B[cn];W[cm];B[bm];W[fm];B[eo];W[dl];B[gf]C[P: good. a turn like this is often big.]
;W[fe];B[ff]C[P: this is aji keshi. if white follows you and blocks, you have only made white more solid]

(;W[ef]
(;B[fh]C[P: there isnt much opportunity to invade, so this doesn't really threaten anything, and it will be very difficult to make points in the middle because of p17 and p8 . Usually around this time of the game there are some points floating around to be made easily in sente, just waiting there for the patient player who is mindful of the whole board. see my alternatives for some ideas.]
