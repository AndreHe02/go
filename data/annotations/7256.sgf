AB[pd][dp]C[Dear Reviewer,
I've added my own comments to the game.  I'd appreciate any suggestions you can offer as to how I could have played better.  Thanks!]
;W[cd]C[moshes [23k?\]: hi good luck

Reviewed by CJT for black. My comments are marked "C:" - and my overall analysis is at the end...

Thanks.];B[pp];W[ic];B[cj]C[I don't know why I went there, obviously it would have been bigger to take Q10, this move just asks for an invasion.  Oh well.

C: The star points would have been good moves here, as you imply, but you shouldn't fear the invasion - after all you can't cover both Q10 and K4! Use your attack on the weak invading group to make territory.]
;W[pj];B[ql];W[pg];B[nc]C[C: you invite w to play M17 and take territory on the upper side. One line further prevents this W extension, and keeps the J17 stone weak to add power to a later invasion at E17]
;W[lc];B[qe];W[nf];B[jp];W[mp];B[oq];W[mn];B[cg]LB[ec:a]C[I considered L3 to rob him of any base, but it seemed like a very small move so I went here instead.

C: I like this move - it prepares you well for an invasion at A]

LB[eh:a][ol:b][ho:c]C[I guess I should have done something bigger than this, as it loses sente.  Maybe securing the bottom middle group, or extending the moyo on the left.

C: yes, this is an endgame move worth maybe 4pts max - A, B and C are the first 3 moves that spring to mind - all much bigger than 78.]

(;B[ol]C[a bad mistake - maybe my biggest.  I should have known better than to leave so many weak groups behind in the bottom middle.

I was looking at the board and scared that he would get the entire middle, and that I only had a little territory here and there.  I couldn't think of the best way to increase my territory so I though I had to move out into the middle somehow.

C: yes - if your weak groups were secure, then this would be a good move - attacking the white group below strongly. But saving your lower groups is even bigger.]

(;B[ne]C[this I knew right away was a mistake, I should have played N15 instead.

C: there are still two massive moves on the board - O6 to capture the Q7 group, and G3 to capture the J6 group.

Of these, O6 is the obvious one - you should always try to keep in mind that splitting your opponent into eyeless groups is a good idea. If you had played O7 to kill the Q7 group, it's possible you could have found a more straightforward way to kill the N5 group (and thus the J6 group) without needing to spot the move at G3...]

C[moshes [20k\]: thanks for the game

C: general comments on the game:

* In the opening, try to avoid letting your opponent play her ideal extensions - think about the move you would play if the sides were reversed.
* Try to read out the life-and death problems - I know it's not easy to do quickly - I took a fair while to read them while reviewing this game. However, had this game been closer, you might not have got away with letting white live in the lower left corner and lower right side.
* Overall you didn't make any big mistakes - most of your moves seemed to be in the right direction, and your instinct seemed good.
* Next time you think "I should have been able to kill that group", go back to your game afterwards, and have a go at finding the best variations - this will improve your intuition for whether a situation is worth spending lots of time reading out or not.

Hope you've enjoyed this review :o)])
