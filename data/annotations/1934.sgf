C[Dear reviewer,
My name is Thomas and I ("hats") played black in this game.

J: Hi, Thomas, I'll try to do my best. I'll prefix my comments with "J:", from my name Jaime

After seeing the whole game, I see I haven't included many comments, as there are not many errors; and you lost the game in the final stages for one error. Your judgements were correct (about who was ahead etc) so I believe with a few minor corrections you should be well on your way up the rank.


Anyway, I would like to make a few relating your play and the game:

- IMHO, your worst defect is to lose sente too often; if you count how many points you've "lost" playing unnecesary moves (or starting gote sequences), you'd be amazed. Now I'll pass the game again marking "gote" all the moves I find as innecesary gotes.

- A minor defect, well, maybe not some minor but it's a plague for most of us, is playing in "auto-mode"... I mean defending when there's no need or not defending when it's needed (this way you lost your lower-right group and the game!). Just think twice before placing the last stone or before switching to play elsewhere (tenuki)

- I liked the way you both made your moyos, and I think you should look at how white enlarged his always after a gote move from your part. Sometimes he enlarges his while reducing yours, the best option of course.

Good luck and don't hesitase to contact me if you want so.]

;B[no];W[mo];B[mn];W[jo];B[cj];W[cm];B[cg];W[gd];B[ce]C[J: I think this move is a little bit superfluous. How about k17, or otherwise enlarging the upper side?]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ee];B[ek]C[T: I am quite unsure about this move (B23), the main reason was that I didn't want to let W place a stone in that area

J: Ok, I understand, but if you don't want white making a big moyo there, something more aggresive (E7, even E5) are needed. Also, you have the san-san invasion (C3) for reducing later... With this move you're actually helping white!]
;W[em]C[J: correct answer from white :-( Always try to imagine how will the opponent answer before placing a stone, sometimes you'll be surprised of the result!]
;B[ml]C[J: still, something in the upper side is bigger];W[nd]
;B[qf];W[kd]C[J: ops, the upper side turned white!];B[nf];W[jl]
;B[lf];W[md];B[oc];W[od];B[pc];W[nc];B[nb]C[J: this is small! this kind of moves are better left for the end-game. Why don't attack him (maybe J16) or try to enlarge your left moyo?
GOTE];W[mb];B[ob];W[ld]C[J: ... even if white refuses to take sente... :-)]
;B[oe]C[T: looking at the board, I was quite content with the placement of the black stones.

J: yes, but I believe white's a little bit ahead (being too soon as there's little definite territory). I think you should be more aggresive... and now white as the initiative

BTW, this move is questionable, but I'm sympathetic with it, as it makes black feel easier... :-)]
;W[ne];B[of];W[jf]C[J: see? This white move enlarges his upper zone while reducing the posible expansion of yours]
;B[cq]C[T: I wonder if the 3/3 invasion was a good idea. Doesn't seem so in hindsight.

J: not bad, I think, even if it removes the possibility of any other invasion there (difficult now, anyhow)]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[bp];W[do]C[T: I think this was not the best move by W. If he plays C2 instead, B is in trouble, right?

J: I believe black can live anyway, but yes, with C2 he'll (I mean you)  live smaller. However, white is making sure in exchange for a few points... this cutting point could be dangerous later]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq];B[an];W[am];B[ao];W[bs];B[ar];W[ds]
;B[cs];W[es];B[bl]C[J: good forcing move... now you should forget it and play elsewhere]
;W[bm];B[cl];W[dl];B[dk];W[gl]C[J: Ag, this move hurts, is the kind of move you should be making. Anyway, you've succesfully reduced white territory]
;B[ln]C[J: too timid? L6?];W[ko];B[bd]C[J: this is *OK*, being sente]
;W[bc];B[be];W[cb];B[kl];W[km];B[ll];W[kn];B[kg];W[jg];B[jk]
;W[il];B[ik];W[hk];B[hj]C[J: this moves are dangerous, as white is going to extend between your zones, reducing one of them ... why don't just K12?  This central zone should yield no points for both of you]
;W[gj];B[hi];W[gi];B[fh];W[gh];B[el];W[dm];B[fl];W[fm]C[T: At this stage I was thinking that B(me) is leading.
But probably the right side isn't yet  black territory.

J: Well, it highly probable black territory, but maybe too wide to be 100% sure. BTW, your last moves, while correct, are smaller than securing the right side of your left territory (say, F11) or the opposite (say K12). Fortunately white has answered every move...]
;B[nr]C[J: GOTE];W[mr];B[or]C[J: this sequence is gote (now white can choose) and thus should be avoided till unavoidable :-) You've got  4 points with the sequence, but now white can make more...]
;W[hh];B[ji];W[ii];B[ij];W[ih];B[jh]C[J: white has succeded in making a defect in your shape... L10 (instead of K12) while smaller, seems the best move to protect both points...]
;W[kf];B[lh];W[nn];B[on]C[J: I won't comment this fight, just to mention maybe O7 was a better defending point (but I really mean maybe...)]

;W[rn];B[ro];W[so];B[rp];W[qk];B[rk];W[ff]C[T: Black lost a little, but I didn't really worry about.

J: well, black lost quite a bunch of points... now the right zone looks as definite territory]
;B[eg];W[fg];B[eh];W[ef];B[df];W[fi];B[ei];W[ej];B[dj];W[fk]
;B[fj];W[al];B[gk]LB[bk:a]C[T: Here I considered just defending at "A" (B9) for some time, but thought that I had a chance of getting into W's territory if I give up B8/C8

J: Not a bad idea; however, if white had played better, I'd think he'd end ahead in this sequence]
;W[bk];B[hl];W[hm];B[gm];W[gn];B[gl];W[hn];B[ck];W[bj];B[bi]
;W[ai];B[ah];W[ak];B[aj];W[pj];B[pi];W[ai];B[ig]C[T: here we seem to just play around with a ko

J: yes, ok, but never forget it's a small ko, don't you lose a big group in the battle!]
;W[hg];B[aj];W[ns];B[os];W[ms];B[ai]C[J: oh oh...];W[pq]C[T: Then W played this move. I didn't see any good defense, probably I should have secured the cutting point long ago.

J: No, there was no need, the problem is the P1 move; after P1, instead of taking the ko you should have defended the cutting point...]
