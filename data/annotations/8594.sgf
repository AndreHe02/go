C[LucianoS [4k\]: This pincer always confuses me, i should learn the joseki.]

[ck:B]TR[gq]C[LucianoS [4k\]: I guess having to do this? so white plays C15 and my influence gets wasted?

White should play even closer at A, a black response at B would be painful, and if black C then white D.\]\]'

I should note that because of this G3 stone, white has much more influence on the bottom, you only have influence towards one direction]

(;B[ce];W[bo]
(;B[bn]C[This is so small right now. There's really no point in defending from B5 since the D10 area is most definitely not territory yet.]

(;B[ee]C[Dangerous]
(;W[cb];B[dd]C[Not sure if this is the best response, but in this position it's really hard to say where a good move can be found for black]
(;W[bc]C[This is a big mistake];B[ec];W[cd];B[fd]C[LucianoS [4k\]: I figured switching to the other side would be good, working with R16, as the group of C5 is strong enough

Strong enough to live? Sure. But really not strong enough to do much else, you really got a good deal out of this exchange and I'm pretty sure it's because both of you are overvaluing the left side.]

(;B[qh]C[LucianoS [4k\]: Now C15 is uncomfortable, but since there is no danger around it, i thought i should build strenght and territory with R12

What do you mean by uncomfortable? It's extremely powerful at the moment. In fact you should probably the attack that left white group, it's just begging for it.]

(;B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[pl]C[You let white have more than he should have]
;B[oh]C[LucianoS [4k\]: Is P12 as good as Q8? I thought it was a fair exchange]
;W[kc]C[This is pretty painful for black, which is why I favored L16 over P17]
;B[ic]C[Miserably overcentrated, but not much you can do]
(;W[eb]C[Not only is this unnecessary but it also strengthens black (see variation)]
;B[fb];W[nd]
(;B[od];W[ne];B[oe];W[ke];B[hf]C[LucianoS [4k\]: I was a bit happy, having white L17 group and D13 groups eyeless to attack. Was this thinking correct?

I guess you were trying to do a double attack with this move, and it isn't too bad of an idea. But the groups are too far away from each other for a double attack to be effective. You need to push them towards each other first, as of now left is relatively safe (especially with B13) so white can focus on L17 and since your attack wasn't very strong on either side, he has plenty of space.]

;W[mg];B[lf]C[LucianoS [4k\]: My attack on the left group gave me strenght to attack L17 group. Was this correct, besides my technical mistakes?

You would have gotten far more strength if your attack on the left group was on a larger scale. At this point white might have a chance at living.]

Yes, but middle was just a string of mistakes on both sides, J7 being the last. You really should have switched attention ot middle sooner]
