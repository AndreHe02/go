AB[jd][dj]C[Dear reviewer,
I played black in this game against GnoGo 3.4.
I know that playing against computer isn't so instructive, but an internet connection costs! So I play rarely on KGS.
This game ended with a Jigo, cause the Komi is set to -4 (I've found an handicap-table on the EDO Go Club's site). So I would like to know where I have lost or not gained the decisive point.

Thank you in advance,
RCarter

[Nacho\]: Hi, I'm Nacho. I'll do the review of your game. This is my first review, so please be patient.]
;W[dd];B[jj];W[hc];B[kg];W[hk];B[cg]LB[cf:A]C[[Nacho\]: I like this move, it is big, and takes good hold of the left side.
It also threatens to reduce white's only secure territory, the top side.
But (there's always a but), maybe it's not aggresive enough. And I stress the maybe there. I myself would have played at A. White does not have a good answer to that. He has no space to pincer, F10 leaves the corner open (black can slide to B10, and take a big chunk of it), but is probably the best option, as C10 would be too slow, and C9 would force you to make a play you want to make, and still fail to take the corner.]
;W[ce];B[fk];W[jl];B[kk];W[kl];B[ck]LB[jb:B][jc:D][kc:C][fd:E]
[cj:A]TR[cg]C[[Nacho\]: Defending against the sansan invasion is ok, but there are other ways. 
At A (C4) for example, is a little more help to the marked stone.
Anyway, your move is not wrong.

Another thing to think is that maybe the opposite corner is bigger. Any white invasion here will be able to barely live, if it does live (the F3 stone is strong), but on the upper right white has many things to do (like B, C, or D). Black D not only would prevent those plays by white, it would also solidify black's territory on the right.

Also, you could try something around E, although I agree with you that maybe it is the time to defend against invasions.]
;W[lk];B[lj];W[jb];B[kc];W[hi]
(;B[hg]LB[kb:C][fc:B][fd:A]C[[Nacho\]: Maybe you should think of doing something with white's position on the top. A should be enough, just a reduction. B is too far inside white's area.
Also, L12 is worth nearly ten points, which is quite big.];W[fd]

(;B[fh]C[[Nacho\]: I don't like this one.  I suppose the idea is to separate the lower white group from the upper one. There are other choices for this.
The problem with this move is not that it is bad... after all it accomplishes what you wanted, separates white. But maybe there are better moves which do the same and also do something else. (see variations, I made too many, and many of them are probably wrong, but, just to give you an idea of what might happen)

And you still have L12, which is big.

Now, on second thought, I don't think white could connect anyway.]
;W[ih];B[ig]LB[kb:A][ll:B]TR[hg]SQ[kd][ld][md][ke][le][me][kf]
[lf][mf][lg][mg][kh][lh][mh][ki][li][mi]C[[Nacho\]: Your stone is safe, so is your territory. There are still bigger points than this, like A or B]
;W[kb];B[kh]C[[Nacho\]: This is too solid I think.. White M11 would be big and sente, or else you lose your points, and the corner is always big.]
;W[lb];B[lc];W[bf];B[cf]LB[bg:A]C[[Nacho\]: Here A was better. Keep it simple. You'll have to block white's advance anyway]
;W[bg];B[bh]C[[Nacho\]: Now you stopped him, but one point behind. That's why the previous move was wrong.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[mb];B[ld];W[ll]
(;B[ff]C[[Nacho\]: Too small. Try to think of the kikashis.]

;W[gi];B[fi];W[gk];B[fg]LB[hd:B][ag:A]C[[Nacho\]: Order of plays in yose is:
- Sente plays first
- Then gote plays
- Finally, one point kos

Kos should be played in the end ALWAYS.

You had at least two better moves than this.

Of the two, A should be played first.];W[hd];B[ag];W[be];B[af]
;W[ae];B[ah];W[jc]C[[Nacho\]: Game's already over. This is dame.]

[bm][cm][dm]C[[Nacho\]: Well, that's it.

Playing computers is OK, as long as it's not all the practice you get. Internet connection is indeed expensive, but, in my opinion, it's not the best practice either. You should first of all, play human beings. And play a lot. One more important thing about playing against computers: once you defeat it in an even game, don't play them anymore. Computers always play the same style, so you will just pickup bad habits of how to beat that particular opponent, which will by then be weaker than you.

Now, remember when I pointed you the two big points in the right corner? Well, that would have made a big difference. Corners are always big, and even more on smaller boards.

Well, I hope this review was useful to you. If you have any further questions or comments, don't hesitate to send me an email.
