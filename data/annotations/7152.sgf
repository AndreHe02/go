;B[pp]C[jbourj: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.
creedfox: hello];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[fc];W[ec]
(;B[id]C[RB> Typical  joseki would have black play at F16 and then white will typically extend to C14 or D14. Then black can extend across the top. Playing J16 now leaves white the option of playing F16 which is a strong move for white because it erases much of the value of black's original approach move.]
;W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[hb];W[md]
(;B[nc]C[RB> see variation];W[mc];B[mb];W[nd];B[oc];W[od];B[pe]
C[RB> so far so good. Black has the corner and white is over concentrated (heavy) and thus easy to attack.]
;W[lb];B[nb];W[jb]
(;B[ib]C[See variation.];W[kc]
(;B[ge]C[RB>  THis is a nice shape move but the priority is to attack whit'e free floating group. THis move then is slack.]
;W[ee]C[White 26, a profitable move for white is possible becasue white is not defending his weak group.]
;B[fe];W[eg]C[RB> Now it is black that is under attack and white that is gaining profit instead.]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[bg];W[cf];B[bf];W[be];B[cj]C[RB> Slow. Better at C8 at least for your strength]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[cp];B[cm];W[cn]
(;B[bn]C[RB> D7 is better as it gives black more access to the center. Also, B6 induces white to play B5 and form a tiger's mouth while further securing the corner. Then black must either abandon his B6 stone or spend another move in gote to defend.]
;W[bo];B[bm];W[dn]C[RB> This is the point to compare with the earlier variation move at D7. White's position is stronger.]

(;B[fd]C[RB> ??? I don't see the purpose in this. If you're trying a forcing move causing white to fill at E16 doesn't help black as his F16 stone does not strength to his position.]
;W[ka];B[if]C[RB> Good! This groups needs to poke out past the neighboring white groups to avoid future trouble. This should have been the move instead of F16. Had white skipped L19 and attacked at K15 black would have been under a lot of pressure.]
;W[pj]
(;B[qi]C[RB> First, don't play contact. Second, I think Q 12 would have been better. Actually, I might have played from the other direction to strengthen black's Q4 stone.]
;W[qj]C[RB> No black is under attack and not white ;-) This often happens with contact play.]
;B[ri];W[rj];B[qm];W[pi];B[ph];W[si];B[rh];W[sh];B[sg];W[sj]
;B[rf];W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[RB> I would rather play R4.  (See Vaiation)];W[qp]
;B[qo];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[po];W[ro];B[rn];W[rp];B[no];W[jp]

(;B[kq]C[RB> Again, contact play for black  helps white grow stronger. Better to play M4. 

As you get stronger you'll even learn how to use the thickness of your right corner group to attack white's K4 stone. (Variation)]
;W[jq];B[kr];W[jr];B[fq]LB[nq:A]C[RB> Too deep I think plus this move leaves an invasion at A.]

(;W[fp]C[RB> Had white moved to protect his corner black would have been in even more trouble. (See Variation)]
;B[dr];W[eq];B[er];W[gq];B[fr]
(;W[gr]C[RB> Again, black gets a break. (See Variation)];B[bq]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[bp];B[aq];W[ap];B[bs];W[ar];B[br];W[dq];B[ke]
LB[md:A][pj:B]C[RB> Excellent! WHite has the A group and B group that must be attacked.]
;W[kd]
(;B[jd]C[RB> Slow. Keep the pressure on white! (See Variation)]
;W[le];B[kf];W[lf];B[ki];W[oh];B[pg];W[og];B[of];W[ni];B[hi]
;W[nf]C[RB> Now white is off the hook and no longer has weak groups to worry about.]
;B[oe];W[ne]
(;B[gg]C[RB>  Better to use this move to remove the weakness at O2.]
;W[ei];B[mk];W[pl];B[pm]C[RB> Stop to think about your responses. This move of white's threatens nothing. It's not making big territory wither. So, do something important with this move.]
;W[nl];B[nm];W[ml];B[mm];W[ll];B[kk];W[lk];B[mj];W[lj];B[li]
;W[mi]C[RB> The close play led to too many cutting options for white and became profit for him. Now it is black that has weaknesses to worry about.]

(;B[ff]C[RB> Missed opportunity];W[ef];B[ed];W[dc];B[ga];W[eb]
;B[ql];W[om];B[on];W[ol];B[kn]C[RB> Black is fortunate to have gotten this move in without being attacked. This might happen against another 16 kyu player. But whaen taking 4 stones let's say against a stronger opponent defending this later would have cost you.]

[sq][sr][ss]C[jbourj: 68.5 to creedfox: 72.0

RB> So, the game was 3.5 points. Did white mean to give you a 1 stone advantage but going with 0.5 komi. If so, a very close win that could have been a blowout. If not, white would have normally take 6 additional points as komi and you would have lost by 2.5. 

Overall, I would say to work the middle game and direction of play. As you become more aware of the whole board position, you'll see more options and will be able to put more pressure on your opponents.

Thanks for allowing me to review your game. I've posted a video version of this review on my go blog at http://razorbrain.wordpress.com/2009/03/15/game-review-for-creedfox-16-kyu/]

(;B[qm];W[qg];B[qf];W[pg];B[rj]C[RB> White's invasion of the right side has gained little in this scenario because now he has two floating groups. (Black can push in and threaten to cut white's groups and even if white connects, black can attack from the other side while strengthening his top center group.) Meanwhile black has gained profit in the lower right!]

C[RB> Black profits while white works for eye shape. Remember you don's have to kill white, just profit.]
))
(;B[kc]C[RB> L17 is a stronger attacking move. Don't forget that white should be on the defensive here, not black. L17 threatens to cut at M17. The variation shows one possible continuation if black connects. While there are a number of other ways white can respond, none of them favor white.]

)))
(;B[oc]C[RB> I like black 13 here better. Playing O17 is contact. After white plays N17, black will feel the need to respond again to strengthen the O17 stone. Instead by playing back at P17, black still threatens white's stone but remains strongly connected .

The idea here is to remain strong and force white to run. Then black will make a large profit on the right while giving chase. Also black's other group at the top will run out with the white stones and then be able to to use the resulting thickness and/or influence to attack on the left.]
