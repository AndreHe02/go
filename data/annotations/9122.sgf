C[Hello dear reviewer, my Nickname is Oceandrop and I played Black in this game, it was a unranked but serious 25 minute game with 5x30 byo-yomi.

My Opponent got early on a decent wall facing the center, and I did not really know how to handle it, and lost the game by resignation, I hope you can help me to gain a better understanding. I added comments and questions along the way, so I hope its easier for you to review this game.

Thanks already for your time beforehand!

Hi, my name is Tim Kington, and I'm 1-2d AGA.  I'll be your reviewer today :)]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf];W[kd]C[OD: I see this move very often now, even in some pro games, funny enough some time ago a Dan actually said to me when I played this and he reviewed the game that this move was bad and K16 is more normal, but I think now L16 is also okay, just more solid?

I think it's probably fine.  Pretty much any move a pro plays is going to be okay for us mere mortals.]
;B[fq]C[OD: Normally when I play the chinese, I play K4, but I don't like it when white plays something like H3, so I wanted to try out the approach in this game.]
;W[cn];B[jp];W[cf];B[po]C[OD: I was very happy so far, but I knew the game wasn't just over yet.]
;W[ok];B[pi]C[OD: Was this okay? I feared that when I play Q7 that my two stones at the top become too weak.

This seems fine.  Q7 would be okay too.  Those two stones at the top aren't that weak, and Q7 would make the invasion at the bottom a lot harder.]
;W[np]C[OD: I didn't exactly know how to handle this move, so I tried to remember what I learned as basics and keep O4 and P9 apart.]
;B[on]C[OD: Is P6 a good move to keep the two white stones apart?

This seems okay to me.  There are so many possibilities that I can't say anything with confidence.]
;W[lp]C[OD: White apparantly keeps my stones apart too, I thought about playing N6, because it looks like my Opponents key point, but I feared that he would be able to attack my three-space high extension somehow, so I wanted to strengthen them with the next move at L3.]
;B[kq]C[I would play here too.];W[mm]C[OD: Now again, I was a bit lost, but I wanted to fight and played N6 for cutting.]
;B[mn];W[ln]C[OD: Is N6 from me any good? I now thought about just playing N5, but ended up playing the cross-cut.

This seems fine, but I think the cross-cut is a mistake.  I would play N5 directly.]
;B[lm]C[OD: I feel like this is bad for me, and I should have played just N5 instead of the crosscut at move 23.]
;W[kn];B[mo]C[OD: White played 26 at N8 next, but after the game, what if white played L4 instead and threaten K3? I added a variation here.]

(;W[ml];B[lo];W[hq];B[hp];W[gp]C[OD: Would J3 be a better move for black than G3 in this situation?

Maybe you could play J3 and then invade the corner after G3?  That might be okay.  You don't really want to give up the 20 points you have right now on the bottom.]
;B[gq];W[ip];B[ho]C[OD: I think this was bad, because white could now connect his stones at L4? (But didn't in the game)]
;W[io];B[iq];W[hn];B[go];W[gn];B[fo];W[fn];B[jo]C[This is not important, and actually helps White.  Play a big move instead.]
;W[jn];B[in];W[im]LB[ic:a][he:b][ef:c][eb:a][jd:b]C[OD: Here he got his wall, I wasn't too unhappy about it, because I thought I would be able to reduce center, I played at J17 (A) but he played H15 (B) so I changed my mind, but I wasn't sure how I could reduce his center now, I thought and played E14 (C) was the best way. Should I have played C directly instead of A? Or more calmly for example E18 and then if he encloses my group reduce from the right side by jumping out into the center? Or something different?

You have a lot of points, but if you let White have the entire area he has staked out, you will lose by a lot.  You have to live in at least one place in White's area.  Personally, I might play A next, but at some point you're going to have to deal with the center.  Something like B might be good - maybe you could live while runing the center and top side at the same time?]
;B[ic];W[he]C[OD: I feared that simply living at the top wasn't enough, and also jumping out at J15 for example would just help him solidifying much territory by chasing my J17 stone, so I changed my mind and played E14 next. Do you have any hints on how to handle such a situation? Or was my estimation simply wrong, and living at the top would have been enough?]
;B[ef]LB[cj:a]C[I don't like this move.  It's floating, and can't connect to the other one, so one of these is almost certainly going to die.  How about C10?  You can get a one-point jump in one direction or the other, and you can probably live somewhere on the left.]
;W[gd];B[de];W[ed];B[ce]LB[cg:a]C[Won't this just force White to make the stone stronger?  I would prefer A.  At least then you're getting something facing an open area.]
;W[ch];B[di]C[OD: I fear I should have jumped at E12, so either my next move would have been G13 or jumping at the corner at C17?

This seems okay.  You just shouldn't expect to keep all of your stones, which is fine.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[ci];B[dj];W[cd];B[fi];W[fj]LB[gj:a]C[A seems to be the move.  Force White to extend, and continue to run into the center.]
;B[be];W[cj];B[dk];W[ck];B[hi]LB[gj:a]C[OD: Better at G13?

How about A, and then G13?];W[fg];B[eg];W[gj];B[gi];W[dl];B[gf]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb]C[Good call.  It's very important to get sente here.]
;B[ie]C[OD: I think that was my biggest mistake in the game, he gave me sente so I should have played J13 to make sure his F13 stone is captured, instead of creating a second weak group and even pushing the Opponent into my own group :(

I agree.  This is a really bad idea.  If you want to be really greedy, maybe L17?  This is crazy though, you're basically forcing White to kill the center group.]
;W[hf];B[if];W[hg];B[ji];W[ig];B[kf];W[jg];B[ke];W[kh];B[ki]
;W[li];B[lj];W[mi]C[How about something like the variation?]

(;B[mj]C[This invites the cut.];W[kj];B[kk];W[jj];B[ij];W[jk]
;B[jl];W[ik];B[hk];W[il];B[gg];W[hh];B[bd]C[OD: I think life is possible if I would have jumped at B17, I saw it already after I played B16, but it wasn't a misclick, just a mistake, so I was very demotivated.]

;W[ej];B[el];W[ei];B[en];W[ld]C[OD: I played those sequences even if I knew they wouldn't work, but I was sad and didn't want to resign this game exactly at the point where I knew I had lost because I enjoyed it and  wanted to show some spirit to my Opponent.]

I don't see a lot of big mistakes in this game.  The main issue is just that you let White build a huge moyo, and then you didn't know how to deal with it.  NEVER push the opponent toward your weak group unless you're planning on sacrificing it. It mostly came down to that one big mistake.  I think you would have been okay if you played an extra move on the center group before looking at the top, or if you tried to make the top group live by moving to the right.  If you play K9 at the key moment, you might have still been able to live in the center. If you have any follow-up questions, you can reach me at timkington@gmail.com]

(;B[jk];W[lk];B[hk]C[It's not obvious how White will stop you from getting an eye although he probably can, and if you succeed, you might live.  You have half an eye at F13, and White may make a mistake on the edge.]

(;W[kp];B[ml]C[I would feel compelled to ignore K3 and play N8, thats why I think the crosscut was bad from me, but white didn't play L4 in the game.]
