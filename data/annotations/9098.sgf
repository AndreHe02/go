C[   Hello !
 I am black in this game, and I won, but I felt beginning went not so good, and white probably did some mistakes at the end, anyway it was quite close. Could you help me finding what I and my opponent played wrong, strategically or tactically ?
  Thanks :)




Hi there,

I'm Greg. I'll start all my comments with G:

This was quite the game. The mistakes for both players were all different types. It's hard to suggest a general one place where the game was one or lost, and one thing for you to work on specifically: direction of play, shape, life and death, tesuji, fuseki... I hope my comments help you in at least some of these areas though. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at gtc.cole@gmail.com.

I think white's two main problems were W14 and W76. However, black's main problem were your overconcentration on the right side, and playing the ko threat in the top right corner that didn't really kill it. You also missed a few chances to kill black on a large scale. In the end you won, but it was close. The mistakes almost cancelled each other out. I think if I liked any of black's moves the best, I like B57. It's a move I would normally never play. You also handled the top quite nicely.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qn]C[I tried a Kobayashi fuseki, and decided to play the simple R4 here.]
;B[qp];W[qj]
(;B[ql]C[R10 was unexpected (I was thinking R9 instead), and I thought invading to split white was a good idea, as the lower right corner is solid.

G: I think this is premature. There is no rush to immediately attack there. Until you have more stones on the bottom right, I believe this is a mistake in direction. I would play this more calmly. See variation.]
;W[on];B[ol];W[nq]C[G: Yeah, this is too deep for white. I would have played P4 in an attempt to build thickness, then attack the P8 stones.]
;B[np]C[Contact move to attack is a bad idea, but I didn't find any other in order not to get enclosed too soon.

G: You have to find someway to split white and i do believe this is the best way to do it.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[pp];B[qq];W[mq];B[mp];W[lp]
(;B[lo]C[G: I would have played this more simply. The result still looked okay, but i think jumping out would be simple, and easier.
See variation.];W[mo];B[no];W[ko]
(;B[kp]C[G: I don't think giving white a ponnuki (the flower shape at M4/6 and L5/7) is a good idea. It leaves a ko for the N4 stones if white so wishes. I would have simply captured. Yes, it damages the K4 stone, but in return, white's Q4 stones are in grave danger. See variation.]
;W[ln];B[lq]C[The ko seems pretty big (what about white O6 here ?), but he ignored it ...

G: He doesn't really have a lot of ko threats right now. He did the right thing. Leave it, and play bigger moves, until there is a situation where he does have the ko threats.]

(;W[pl]C[G: another bad move by white. This wedge just makes black stronger, and damages R10. It seems white is simply trying to make the game complicated.]
;B[pk];W[pm];B[qk];W[ok]
(;B[pj]C[G: I would play the hane here. Your resulting shape in a few moves, after you play R11, seems really overconcentrated. The R11 stone is not that important that you need to completely kill it. It is better to think on a larger scale. See variation.]
;W[nl]
(;B[qi]C[G: At least play P10 before this.];W[nc]C[Up to here, white gets a nice position, and the N3/03 stones seem to be able to get worrying...

G: Yeah the black Q10 stones got really overconcentrated. For all of the six stones, you get no influence, and only 10-12 points underneath it. The R14 area is even still open. In go, one has to judge to value of a single stone. Is the white R10 stone really that important, or can I be a bit more open with my play, be more open.]
;B[lc];W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[G: This is a hard one, but I think I would block in the other direction. After you get the wall at P/Q/R16, the black stones in that area look even more overcontrated, especially without the P10-O9 exchange. The stones at R9 are completely safe, and there isn't too much more potential territory on the top right. I would block the other way, let white have his points, and aim for the top side, which is still nice and open. See variation.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
(;B[lo]C[I decided the ko was really big.

G: I agree that now is the time to fix the ko. However, I think there are better ways to solve it. See variation.]
;W[fc];B[ci];W[ck];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[hq]C[I wasn't sure what to play here, and I went wrong.]
;B[mn]C[G: I quite like this move. It looks slow at first, but is damages the right side white group a lot. It is very thick. White cannot kill the F3 stone in one move.]
;W[fp]
(;B[gp]C[G: As a note I would prefer jumping into the corner at C3 to this, but in the game this turned out better because white blundered.]

(;W[gq];B[ep];W[eq];B[fo];W[fr]C[G: So good for black. White's shape leave a ko behind which is too big for white to lose. However, black's stones there are really light, so he doesn't lose too much if he loses the ko.]
;B[dq];W[fp];B[oc]C[I thought this was a good threat, is there any way to kill now ?

G: Unfortunately not. White will live in the corner, even with P18. This is I think one of black's bigger mistakes. White gets quite a bit out of this trade. I think a better threat was P10. If white captures the ko, you can take the whole right side.]
;W[eo];B[ob];W[rf];B[se];W[pb];B[oa];W[ra];B[ei];W[jc];B[hc]
C[G: Good move. K17 came too close to thickness.];W[lb];B[kc]
C[G: Correct. Let white crawl on the second and third line and take a large center.]
;W[kb];B[jd];W[ic];B[id];W[hb];B[hd];W[gb];B[oj];W[nk]
(;B[li]C[G: Good idea, but I think slightly out of place. See variation.]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[qg];B[qe];W[fe]
(;B[ig]C[G: Again, I would be more open than this. Go for as much as possible. See variation.]
;W[kh];B[lh];W[kg]C[G: White's overplaying. Take everything!]

;B[hh];W[gh];B[hi];W[ge];B[jf];W[ff];B[ke]C[G: Still a pretty good result for black.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[gi]
(;B[cc]C[Maybe bad idea ... But giving white both left corners seemed to big to allow ...

G: Yep. That just dies. Both the left corners are too strong to invade. However... See variation.]
;W[be];B[bf];W[hj];B[ii];W[af];B[ag];W[ae];B[nm];W[om]
(;B[qo]C[G: This is not soo important. It is vital to get N8.]
;W[mm];B[nn];W[lm]
(;B[bh]C[G: At least force the M9 exchange before coming back to this. It's an important shape point to hit. White would die if he ignored that.
