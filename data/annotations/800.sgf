;B[pp]C[Comments by Eitan Aharoni.


to sum up : W was better at local fights and capturing stones, B got a better eye for surrounding large areas. I wonder what was the time frame, I believe both players are capable of playing more accurately then they did.]

;W[fc];B[cf]C[good, left side is now less interesting.];W[db]
;B[cc];W[ic];B[od]C[this is more an invasion than a regular kakari. if W attaches again, you cannot play same joseki as in lower left. I wonder what sequence you had in mind.  consider r10 instead. if W shimaris, there is still plenty of room to invade the upper side.]
;W[mc]C[W helps you. if now R17 and common joseki, W gets 3-stone wall in line N, which is over-concentrated, and you get a wall facing the fertile right side, and sente. or if W S17, you press him low on the right and aim at L17.]
;B[qc];W[pc];B[pd];W[oc];B[nc];W[nd];B[pb]C[never seen that before...
after W O18 B R15 W S16, you cannot play S17. W crawls 3 times and you must extend, then W S18 and game over. so you must play S15, which is a big loss; big corner for W, and you don't get to atari at O15.]

;W[sh];B[ra];W[sf];B[sd];W[se];B[qa];W[oa];B[kc]C[now you invade W's strongest area. O17 group is solid rock.]
;W[qi]C[good.];B[ke];W[nf];B[og];W[oi]C[W will now get a splitting attack.]
;B[ng];W[lf];B[me];W[ne];B[ni];W[mg];B[oj];W[pi];B[mh];W[nj]
C[a bit slack. K16 then K14 better. this is away from the main battle.]
;B[lh];W[kf];B[le]C[ you cannot really catch W, not yet time to become the hunter. when you have to run - run, and keep ahead.]
;W[jf];B[mf];W[lg];B[of];W[je];B[ib]C[W K17, M18, H18.];W[jc]
;B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[jd];B[gd];W[hb]C[safe play, wrapping the game up.]
;B[he];W[gb];B[ih];W[cj]C[C9 is better because it leaves W the good follow up at c12 (froces B c18), in case B invades at c8.]
;B[cl];W[dl]C[why give B ponnuki, just jump
ahead.];B[dm]C[D9 better. if W draws back now, he can still jump , and from a better base. after D9, W cannot draw back at D7 since B c9 would weaken his lonely stone too much, so he'll have to give you ponnuki and connect underneath in gote.]
;W[cm];B[dk];W[el];B[ck]C[worse result for W here.];W[en]C[too cautious. W should press from above to limit B's new territoryand get at least some thickness.

D7 stone is not important.];B[ek];W[fl];B[fk];W[hf];B[gf];W[hg]
;B[fh]C[well, after W has been so generous, let's count :
W has 60 solid points.
B has 35 points on the left, and bottom formationis worth about 20 more. W has some prospects of attacking the Q16 group, which has 1 sure eye and can get 1 more easily by N10 atari, but N10-O9 exchange is a loss for B. since it's W's sente, I'd play O9, B must L12, then W R6, B O4, then perhaps W N4-M3 standard invasion. so W has the lead, but compared to 12 moves before, game is wide open.]
;W[gg];B[fg];W[fe]C[doesn't work.];B[fd];W[ge];B[ee];W[ff];B[ef]
;W[gf]C[endgame move, worth about 9 points. way too small for this stage.]
;B[gl]C[does not effect W, and you have little prospects in the center since O9 or N10 are W's sente against Q16 group.]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[pn]C[W gets to play first in the important area.]
;B[pl]C[bad. W p7 kills both stones.];W[nq]C[too complicated. doesn't seem like W counted the game.]
;B[pq]C[much too passive ! never get fenced in like that.];W[oo]
;B[ok]C[dangerous. W P8.];W[qn]C[sente against the corner.]
;B[ro];W[rn];B[rl]C[you are not in a position to attack W while your corner is weak.]
;W[rq]C[the vital point.];B[rr]C[not the way to live. first attach and draw back on the left, then play R2.W has to play S4, so you get S2 and live (W Q1 B T2).]
;W[qr]C[good, B dead now.];B[rs];W[qq];B[pr];W[qo];B[np];W[op]

C[this move is responsible to the big area B got at the center. it should be hane at L7 - B cannot cut because of O4 shortage of liberties.]
;B[km];W[jo];B[jm];W[gn];B[hn];W[ho];B[go];W[hp]C[if instead W H7, B has to let him connect in order to keep the center territory.]
;B[in];W[io]C[bad, J2 is correct.];B[hr];W[fo];B[gp];W[gr];B[hq]
;W[qs]C[W should take his sente move at F2 first. the result of J5 mistake is losing sente and the need to take the B corner stones off the board later (semedori), and not capturing K3-L2 stones (or F4 stones).]
