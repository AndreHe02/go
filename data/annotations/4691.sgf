C[This was one of those games where I didn't feel like I really made any huge mistakes, but all the fighting seemed to make things work out better overall for my opponent nonetheless.  There were two large reading mistakes on my part, I think.  One was allowing black to turn my alive group (I thought) into seki in the lower right corner, and the second was allowing a black group on the left side to make life when I think I could have probably killed it.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[oc];W[pp]C[Black seems to be playing a territory oriented opening, so Niren Sei seemed appropriate to counter it.]
;B[cd];W[pj]C[Two potential big opening points here it looks like - blocking the extension from the corner enclosure or approaching the upper left corner.  I chose the first.

[Malweth\] Usually the corner attack is bigger. In this case I believe so, but the difference between the two is probably too little to matter.

One thing I would think about is if black continues as in the variation.]

(;B[ph]C[[Malweth\] This extension is small for B.];W[ed]C[[Malweth\] This is good now. 

You can also think about the D10 approach... D10 is not a normal move, but there is the K4 followup. This may be less effective because of Q12, though (Black can support an invasion if all groups are strong).]
;B[df];W[cc];B[dd];W[dc];B[pm];W[qn]C[This was a shot in the dark at taking away black's base and (hopefully) creating a weak group to chase around, while also protecting the corner.

[Malweth\] This makes Q7 stronger. Q7 is a good move because it pincers Q10.]
;B[nq]C[[Malweth\] It was probably best for B to play at R7 to separate the groups.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[on]C[Vaguely aiming at keeping black separated, though that didn't quite work out.

[Malweth\] This move might have been better before P3. P3 makes black stronger.]
;B[ol]C[[Malweth\] Black is trying to support two groups without bases. This is usually a bad idea.

The idea for white when black plays this way is to let black have one side or the other. In this case, Black has asked for Q10, so white should take O4. A play at O6 or N6 makes the most sense now.]
;W[nj]C[I thought about playing R8 here, also.  The one point jump toward the center seemed like it would help keep black's influence in the upper right corner under control.

[Malweth\] The definite connection with R8 seems better. Black can still be tricky to keep the white groups separated, but they'll both live.

Playing this way makes a weak group. Playing R8 is still dangerous because it lets Black connect easily (B P10). (See my comment on P8).]
;B[or]C[[Malweth\] This is bad. It makes W stronger and gains B nothing. The appropraite play is N8 or K4/K3.]
;W[pr];B[op]C[[Malweth\] This is also bad, losing the peep. It seems B wants to connect, but is it really worth it?]
;W[pq];B[nm]
(;W[jq]C[Didn't see a clear way to keep black separated, so aimed instead at extending from my corner stone and limiting black's space on the side.  Would P7 have worked though, maybe?  Black's move at O7 seems odd, since it's like a self-peep.

[Malweth\] The most you could have done was create cutting points - it's too early for that, though.

Black can take P6 with the net at Q6 so this group is not easily attackable. K3 is probably too close to thickness and should be restrained to G3.

See the variation for P7.];B[nh];W[ml]C[[Malweth\] Black has W on the run now. It's expected that B can attack this group and make the entire top side into moyo.

Perhaps W O12 was better than K3. In any case, W ran into trouble here first with O10.

This move is also dangerous because of the weakness at N9. M10 is better, but still gives B the chance for top side moyo.]

(;B[nk]C[[Malweth\] This is best left in reserve. It should be threatened the way I showed in variation.]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[oj]
(;B[pn]C[B should connect at O8. This will leave the cut behind.]
;W[po];B[oo];W[nl];B[mk];W[lk];B[lh];W[mj];B[nn];W[ql];B[qm]
;W[rn];B[qk];W[rl];B[pl];W[ic]C[The group at M9 seemed fairly safe with one eye already, and plenty of room to either connect to the bottom or make a second eye.  The group in the upper left was unsettled though, and black was developing a rather large area around the corner enclosure in the upper right already.

[Malweth\] M9 is strong enough. The worry was definitely the B moyo. Instead of securing P8, I would have played here as B... P8 is probably strong enough to get a second eye.

J17 is a bit far from E16, though... H17 is the furthest I would go, and G17 is even safer. The D16 group is weak, though... ao even C11 would be possible (setting up a possible W moyo - the B thickness diminishes this possibility, but not too much).]
;B[fc]
(;W[ec]C[This move looks iffy to me now.  Maybe G16 instead?  Not sure.

[Malweth\] It's probably the best move... see variations.];B[kc]
;W[gd]C[Playing G16 later seemed safer, but also ended up letting black expand the upper right even more.

[Malweth\] This move is appropriate. F17 still has aji, though.]

(;B[id]C[[Malweth\] This is aji keshi. It also does little for B's moyo.

Keep in mind that B's moyo isn't particularly big. It is only one quadrent of the board. W has good territory elsewhere and the B thickness in the LL isn't very useful. The game is not over.]
;W[hc];B[jd];W[cj]C[Was either this or trying to reduce the upper right.  Laying claim to the big point on the side seemed more important.

[Malweth\] This is most important. It is probably sente against C16.]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[ff]
(;W[ge]C[[Malweth\] This move seems unnecessary. See var.];B[fq]
;W[eq]C[In retrospect, I think maybe the pincer at H3 would have worked better.  Since black has such an imposing wall of stones on the right.

[Malweth\] H3 isn't a great move either. This is probably best, but you must attack all-out!]
;B[er];W[dr];B[ep];W[dq];B[cn]C[[Malweth\] This move is bad... B should try the attachment at J3 or the normal move of H3.

This type of move is greedy.]
(;W[co]C[[Malweth\] This response, however, is bad - it's exactly what B is looking for!

Think of the cuts, or better the G3 attachment!];B[dn];W[fp]
;B[eo];W[gp];B[gq];W[hp];B[ek];W[cg]C[Starting at E13 is probably best.]

;B[kq];W[ir];B[jr];W[iq];B[jo]C[[Malweth\] The game is over now...]
;W[km]C[The connection prospects with the group on the bottom seemed slim now, so seemed important to get the second eye for the M9 group now.  And reduce black's territory on the bottom side at the same time.

[Malweth\] Yes, this group is in danger now or soon, though it's still probably safe for a short time... Black has too much strength elsewhere.]
;B[rm]C[This is the move that started my long slide into seki, for the group on the lower right.  And it seemed so secure at the time...]
;W[sm];B[rk];W[sl]C[Still blissfully ignorant as to what was going to happen here.]
;B[so]
(;W[ro];B[rp];W[qo]C[I hated this move, but starting a ko with T6 didn't seem much better.  I figured my ace in the hole at this point was black's unprotected weakness at O2, so I went ahead and connected everything.]
;B[sk];W[sn];B[rq]
(;W[nr]C[This seemed important, to establish at least one eye in fighting against the interior black group.]
;B[mr];W[os];B[ms];W[ns];B[qr];W[sr]C[Two eyes in the interior group would have been disaster, of course. I smelled seki in the air, with one eye vs. one eye.]
;B[rr];W[sq];B[sp];W[qs];B[rs];W[ps];B[ss]C[[Malweth\] B didn't need to capture.]
;W[kr]C[Figured I could at least threaten to connect to my lower right corner group, since that would resurrect it from seki.  I wonder if M3 would have been at all effective here instead.]
;B[lq];W[lr];B[gn];W[in]C[Not really trying to connect to the M9 group since I was fairly certain it would have two eyes on its own, but thought that threatened connections and such would at least reduce black's territory.]
;B[io];W[ho];B[hn];W[jn];B[lo];W[gf]C[Black's territory in the upper right looks huge now.  Perhaps I should have tried a more aggressive reduction, such as at K14 perhaps.  I may have been worried at the time that a fight like that would endager the M9 group.

[Malweth\] It's too late now, I think. W will probably die if invading, and connceting will be very hard if reducing.]

C[Now that I had my center group all settled with two eyes, I started think about how to best make trouble for black on the left side.]
;B[fj];W[fl];B[fn]
(;W[dl]C[It looked like this would most likely cut off the group on the left side.  At this point, I think outright killing that group was probably my only real hope of pulling the game back into my favor.  Since otherwise I'd be living fairly small pretty much everywhere.

[Malweth\] It was easy to cut the group off with E10. Killing it afterward is the hard part ;)]
;B[cl];W[el]C[The black group on the left is definitely cut off now, with miai at D9 and E10.  And no eyes in sight, as of yet.]
;B[bl];W[bj];B[ak];W[ai]C[Had to pause in the attack to keep my own group alive, I think.]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[do];W[cp];B[bc];W[bb]C[In retrospect, I think I could have ignored B17.  My group at the top would most likely live anyway, and I think B6 might be a killing move here.  Thoughts?]
;B[kn];W[lm]C[Protecting my second eye.];B[gk];W[gl];B[dk];W[ej]
;B[dm]
(;W[em]C[I think this may have been a bad move also.  Would B6 have been better?  It certainly keeps black from forming an eye by moving at E7 himself, but...]
;B[ao];W[en]C[I'm not sure what I was thinking here, really.  B7 looks like the vital point now.

[Malweth\] Yes. E6 is a useless move - simply threatening a connection. Black must have been happy!]
;B[fo]C[[Malweth\] Or maybe Black still didn't see it!];W[ap]
C[And here I just forced black to play at his own vital point. How embarrassing!

[Malweth\] Yes... you should work on the basic shapes. This is the "bulky 5" - I recommend the "Korean Problem Academy" on Gobase.org (you need a free account there). Complete these problems (Level 1 + 2) over and over until you understand all the basic shapes and can find the vital points in only a few seconds.]
