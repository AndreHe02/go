C[
Your questions and comments show that you already learned a lot from this game. I added some reinforcement of those lessons and some other points. Hopefully these other points are helpful too.]

C[stupid move which eventually lost me the center, it was too much trying to keep this alive and protect area on both sides

I agree. Maybe you are thinking that you can really kill this w group. That is very unlikely. W's decision to invade your moyo at this point in the game is not one I would have made, but he certainly can live. You can get compensation for the loss of what might have been your territory by harassing w while building territory on either side. This move sort of harasses w, but does nothing for you except give you a a weak group. Better moves are something like A,B, or C or just play elsewhere like D or E as examples.]
;W[qg];B[rj];W[pf];B[og];W[of];B[nf]LB[ng:A]C[
Now that you are going down the road of trying to save your group, you should at least play A. You need to get some liberties for your stones and get out into the center to survive. W is strong here and your are weak. Your move acts like you are still trying to enclose w and that is not going to happen. You end up having 2 weak groups.]

;W[ok];B[np]TR[mh][nh][oh][og][pg]LB[mj:A][lh:B]C[
Now you have invested a lot of stones in the triangle group, but it is really weak. The game move is a nice big one, if you didn't have a weak group to worry about.  Something A or B is needed to try to save your group, but it is already late.]

This "leaning" move helps w kill your group.];B[om];W[nm];B[on]

(;B[nl];W[ml];B[nn];W[nk];B[kd]LB[gc:A][fq:B]C[
Both of your corners are strong so I would extend farther from them. Say A or B or something similar.]

LB[ci:A][di:B][iq:C][ip:D][jq:E]C[
I think that might have been better playing at the bottom before your triangle stones, but having played them, you want to extend to A or B to make them work. If w plays at A or B, they will be weak.  Your game move is too close to w's strong corner stones. W could try to pincer you with C,D, or E. Also you feel a need to answer w's next move in a way that you would not if you were farther away.]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[gp];B[kp];W[hp];B[iq];W[ip];B[jq]LB[jp:A]TR[cm]
[dm][dn]C[
A would be better. 3 stones in row is strong enough when they are pointing into your territory like this. Nontheless, w has not played the best. You have a lot of territory at the bottom and his recent;ly played lin of stones is of little use unless he seriously attacks your triangle stones.]
;W[ch]TR[cm][dm][dn]C[
W gets a very big point. He build territory for himself while putting pressure on your triangle stones.]
;B[ce];W[cd]LB[ck:A]SQ[ch]TR[cm][dm][dn]C[
This is not a bad move in many situations similar to this, but I would have played at A to attack the triangle stones while strenghtneing the square stone.]
;B[cj]C[
Good move!];W[eh];B[ee]LB[he:A]TR[ce]C[
Here is a delicate thing. You might be better off playing at A. This move will threaten to connect to your weak triangle stone. Even if this connection does not succeed, this stone is stronger than the triangle stone and you won't have to worry about it as much while you try to reduce w's territory. Your game play gives you a "heavy" group of stones like you had on the right side.]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[gd];B[ge]LB[gf:A]C[
A might be better. It is really obvious what w is going to play.]
;W[he];B[gg];W[hf];B[id]C[
This is just plain wrong! You have invested a lot of stones and are fighting an uphill battle for their very life. Now you play a move on the wrong side that w does not have to answer. Even if he did answer it, it would not help you.]
;W[gf];B[eg];W[ff];B[ef]C[if i would have played anything else than E14 it would have been very hard to keep the group alive, or at least it was the only solution i saw in the game, even so, white let black stay alive.

I am not so sure. They are really weak. They are imbedded in w stones and  facing w stones and have few liberties. To connect to the nearest b group is a real reach and that group is not real strong. The only bright spot is that w's separating group does not have 2 eyes.]
