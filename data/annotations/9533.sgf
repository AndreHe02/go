;W[nd];B[id]C[After personal review of this game, I think this is too early.  White has some potential on top, but the right side and bottom both seem bigger.

Maybe a move like R10 is better.

Do you agree?

[Nexik\] In even game I will suggest K4 but in handicap game is better to play just Q11 to play solid and the same be in check of white moyo.
If you want to reduce white moyo you should jump to F14 (the strongest move in this situation)]
;W[jd];B[gd]C[I tried to be too fancy here.  I think I should simply J15.

Do you agree?
