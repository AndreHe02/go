C[enough: Hello reviewer! I've reviewed my own game and added some possible better moves I could have made. Thank you for the review.

Baga: Hi, Im currently 12kyu-11kyu. 
Therefore none of my advice is gospel. 
Furthermore, I think its more important to understand ideas than to win a game, so if you see some ways you think my advice is wrong...youre right! But probably only if youre thinking in a whole board way instead of the local fighting.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dp]C[Baga: Though theres nothing "wrong" per se with opening at opposite poles (after all your opponent is forced to do the same). 

Perhaps it would be better to start out on the same side (ie Q16 and D16) simply because Go is a game where we try to make our stones work together. And, presumably, till Dan Level...we could use all the practice we can get.]
;W[dd];B[nq];W[qm];B[lp]C[Baga: Generally I would go Q2 here. Makes it solid. Once its solid you can forget about it and go about doing other things. 
On the other hand, what you did ... playing on the 4th line, makes sense usually only if you already have a few third liners in place to support it. Over here you dont.
Once again, I dont think there is anything explicitly WRONG with this move per se, but a bunch of these little non-sequiters in a row would be wrong.]
;W[gq];B[iq];W[dr]
(;B[cq];W[cr];B[cm];W[qg]C[Baga: Your opponent seems to like to play from far away. Think of any way that could change your gamestyle or be sued to your advantage?]
;B[re];W[oi];B[pk]C[enough: I was trying to punish him for playing so high.

Baga: Not a bad idea. However, you have a stone formation at the Top Right AND the Bottom Left. An attack to the Top Left (the intersect point of both those formations) would probably be more fruitful for you. 

(Which side to attack from? Id say Left instead of Top, but the difference might be small this early in the game)]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[qj];B[pi];W[qi]C[Baga: When you invade from Fourth Line, the idea generally is to prevent your opponent from making too much juicy 3 line big territory.

You have already accomplished that goal at this point. You should stop the pressing attack and turn your attention to other details (unless you think your new formation is in danger of course)]
;B[pg];W[oh]
(;B[qf];W[ph];B[og];W[rg];B[pm]C[Baga: Bad move. You should run out into the center.

By the way, notice that because your opponent likes to play his corner formations very thinly, you are left with a viable San-San invasion point. However, by forcing him to defend as you played here... you make it less likely your future San San would be viable and/or survive.]
;W[pl];B[ol];W[ql];B[ok];W[hc];B[cf]C[Baga: Good. but late. 

Now hes more stable, which of course makes your attack weaker.]
;W[ch]C[Baga: Try and think into the future a few moves. 

I believe a more stable formation for you here is more to your advantage than playing more thinly  trying to break him up.]

(;B[np];W[om]C[Baga: Though its easy to get lost in the intricacies and fights in go. Try and take a global View...
 What do you accomplish here? Nothing. 
Both you and him are peeking out into the center of the board from everywhere. Theres not much profit there. 

So your priority should be to stay alive. But nothing more.]
;B[nm];W[on];B[nn];W[oq];B[or];W[no];B[mo];W[oo];B[ml];W[rq]
;B[qr];W[rr];B[qs]C[Baga: There is still something you can extract here.
You have a nice wall. Overconcentrated but nice. Playing around H5 or H6 would give you a big potential central moyo.

However the biggest point I believe is on the open top-center and Top-Right.]
;W[rs];B[nr];W[gf]C[Baga: What I said before still applies. Top center or H5 or H6]
;B[mc]C[Baga: One or two lines more is what Id do ( M17 or L17)]

(;B[dq]C[Baga: See variation. 
Dont know if it'll work, but seeing how youre the one who is relatively safe while he is fighting for life (with no potential gain besides life), its to your advantage to make it complex and hope for a mistake - AKA Big potential gain, small potential loss :-)]
