Moreover this move tends to limit the influence of white on the center which is logical if you have a real influence on it but that's not really the situation  here.]

I think you shuld go for the eastern side of the board to prevent white from making more influence there.

See how white's influence on the east did very well for him. 
this is white's biggest territory and thanks to that he reduced your influence on the center. (In fact, it is your way to answer the 30-44 sequence that helped him ) And the situation could have been much better for white if he did not make a lot of mistakes when defending against your invasion at R16. Anyway the score is very heavy for you but you've got many possibilities to improve your skills with very simple moves. (think more about empty areas for example)]
