(;B[qq]MA[so][sp]C[This move sacrifices the two black stones and secures black's territorry. But it leaves a weak point at R2. A direct play at R2 seems better to me.]
;W[sr];B[rs];W[iq];B[ss]C[This move forces white to capture black. You should only make such moves if you get an advantage elsewhere on the board. This time, the advantage is white's.]
;W[ro];B[sj]C[Again, don't force the opponent to capture your own stones, unless you get an advantage.]
;W[si];B[sq];W[sr];B[sq]MA[cc][dd][gc][cm][cq][md][jp]C[The whole sequence from move 40 till here gave white a territorry of about 20 points. Black's territorry on the lower side is open. The top right corner is also open. Since black doesn't invade white's influence on the left side, white wins the game. Possible points for invading ore reducing white's framework are marked.]
