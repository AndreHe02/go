C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: have fun
yellowmag [1k\]: thanks, you too!

Forfun (hereafter ff) - This is an interesting game.  Both players show a lot of fighting spirit.  At the same time, both could have improved their sense of direction.

From White's point of view, the game began reasonably with White getting territory to Black's influence.  The fighting warmed up when Black invaded the left side quite deeply and White attacked.  Several times during the rest of the game White played away from the center of the action.  This compromised the attack underway and let Black get more out of the position than should have been possible.  One of the key points in Go is to avoid creating weaknesses that can become tools for our opponents.  Spreading our stones too thinly is one of the easiest ways to help our opponents.

In contrast, in the later going both players became fixated on the local situation and missed opportunities to turn to bigger points elsewhere.  This fine balance between understanding when we have to stick close to the fighting and when it is time to look elsewhere for opportunities is the essense of strength.

Let's see what we mean...

(as usual this review is full of incomprehesible comments and undoubtedly incorrect variations; believe it at your own risk :-)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qn];B[po]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: I was a little confused here, I expected R4.  But I think I got a good result.

ff - If we look at professional play, R4 has been the most frequent play by Black at this point.  However, the play at Q5 has consistently produced better results.  It is certainly more active and shows a more positive approach.  So White needs to be ready to answer it.]
;W[rp]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: After the game I looked at some pro games, and I believe this was the right move.

ff - Yes, this is the normal reply.];B[qo]C[ff - There are a variety of plays by Black here, but not usually this one.  More usual would be Q6 or Q8.]
;W[ro];B[pn];W[qm];B[ol]C[ff - Once Black starts pushing White, it is better to keep on going in order not to leave defects in the Black wall, so Q7 looks better here.]
;W[qq];B[oq]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: I believe it could have been much worse for me here, but black played poorly I think.

ff - This las play is clearly out of place.  It should be at Q2.  Black has nothing to fear at Q4.  After this White does not want to play Q2, which only allows Black to play P2 and fix the shape here.  Instead White plays R2, which leaves the P2 stone with nothing to do.]

(;W[nc]C[ff - In this position the right side has no interest for Black because of the White stone at R7.  Naturally Black is going to answer a White approach with a pincer.  It might be better for White to simply extend to the middle of the top.  See the variation...]
;B[lc]
(;W[qc]C[ff - Not really interesting since White ends up very low along the whole right side.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]
(;B[ic]C[ff - This is one normal play but looks pretty conservative in this position.]

(;W[gc]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: After reviewing some pro games I believe this was the wrong side to play on, I understood that the corner was important. But I probably should have played around C14.

ff - Yes, G17 is a play when the Black stones along the top are weak.  For example, when the upper right corner is White and the two stones in the middle of the top are alone.  When the Black top is strong then White prefers to play on the left side.  C14 is one idea but C13 makes it more difficult for Black to split the left.]

;B[bc];W[cf];B[db];W[ee]
(;B[cj]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: I wasn't quite sure what to do about this stone. In retrospect, maybe D2 directly is better.  This is just my style, I think K6 might be good too.

ff - Black plunges straight into White's strength.  This is the type of play when Black thinks that White's influence is greater than Black's.  This does not seem to be the case here.  Black might have done better to hold back.  See the variations...]

(;W[cl]C[ff - Both C8 and C12 are too close to the existing White positions.  Neither can be the right answer here.  See the variations...]

(;B[cg]C[ff - Black attaches to a very strong stone.  This does not work that well.  Black should simply jump into the center...]
;W[dg]
(;B[ch];W[ei]C[ff - This is an interesting approach.  White will be happy to force Black toward the lower side and then make a splitting attack.]

(;B[bl]C[ff - This seems to just strengthen White without really helping Black.  Better leave it unplayed.  See the variation...]
;W[bm]
(;B[ck]C[ff - Not a good idea.  White makes good shape naturally without Black securing the group...]
;W[dl]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: I feel good now.  My play was pretty strong here I think, I was attacking for influence to reduce black's bottom area.

ff - Basically Black falls behind by a move through this exchange.]
;B[ej];W[fj];B[ek]
(;W[fm]C[ff - This is from the wrong direction.  White's two center stones can not contain Black yet so it is too early to play from the other side.  Also this play is too far away from the bottom to represent a significant threat.  See the variation...]

(;B[go]C[ff - Black is too ambitious here.  Better to help the left side first...]

(;W[jn]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: What do you think of this move, maybe it is not so good.  F9 looks pretty good in retrospect.

ff - This play is too far from F7.  White can not securely connect even with an additional play.  Basically White has played away from the scene of the action.]
;B[fk];W[kp];B[ko];W[ip]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: Maybe K5 is better here, im not sure.

ff - Fundamentally White is attempting to reduce a very strong Black position.  The tactical details are just fundamentals of reading that can be practiced through tsumego and tesuji books.  White would prefer to be attacking some weak Black stones instead.  The reason this is not happening here lies in the earlier plays.  Changing those earlier plays so that Black continues to have weak targets to exploit on the board will pay greater benefits than sorting out the details of local fights. :-)]
;B[jo];W[io];B[iq];W[hq]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: I think this is a pretty bad mistake on my part, I should just play H6]

;B[nn];W[no];B[np]
(;W[eq]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: What do you think about this, D2 better, or maybe E2

ff - Locally I tend to prefer E2, but... Is the corner going to die?  Is it the largest part of the board right now?  The difference between E2 and D2 is not an important question if this area is not the most urgent point on the board!]

(;B[fr]C[ff - White is lucky that Black answered.  But what if Black plays elsewhere, ignoring the corner?...]

(;W[gi]C[ff - White should simply connect at F11.  This produces a bad result.  See the variation...]
;B[gj];W[fi];B[hk]C[ff - Black makes the same mistake here that White made at G11.  This would be better at G9.]
;W[gl];B[gk];W[ii]C[ff - Now the H9 stone should be on J9.]
;B[jk]
(;W[lk]C[ff - This does not look right.  White will not be able to make proper use of the wall below.  See the variation...]
;B[kj]
(;W[kd]C[ff - This looks similar to White's earlier play at K6.  It is far away from the scene of the action and it leaves a large gap with the other stones just played.  I think that L12 is the natural continuation here...]

(;W[ih];B[lj];W[qr]C[rlkeaton3 [1k\]: I think this is a fatal mistake.

ff - This is a gote yose play.  Once again White has turned away from the main fight.]

(;W[kf];B[le]
