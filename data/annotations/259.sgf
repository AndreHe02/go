(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[
One general comment.  Several times you make moves that
W doesn't have to respond to.  Everytime this happens, you
are giving him 1/2 stone advantage.  I have made a few comments on  where I think you should have played differently.  Take what I say with a  grain of salt.  It is easy to criticize, especially when you are
not involved in the heat of the battle.]US[Brought to you by IGS]GN[smart-amodeo(B) IGS]

;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[jd];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[kc];B[jc]C[Good standard joseki at the top.

I think white would have done better to play at R14 instead of O10];W[kd]
;B[ke];W[kb];B[le]C[K18 is a better  response. blacks top is open at the bottom, easy for
white to invade. alternately, O14 fences in white.];W[nf];B[me]C[This is a forcing move, but it is a "thankyou move".  You are
makingwhite do what he wants, which is to connect at O15.   A better move would be along the side: Q10 or Q11]
;W[ne];B[nb];W[mb];B[oh]C[This is too high.  Easy for White to slide in at the bottom.

Better on the fourth or fifth line.

This should only be played if you think you can kill white,

which is very unlikely.];W[je]C[ smart 27k*: waht is the 40,000+?];B[jf]

;W[bf];B[cg];W[db];B[eb];W[cb]C[Good joseki.  The upper left is  starting to look like

black territory.];B[hb];W[tt]C[I think h18 may be premature.  This is more an end game  move.

There are lots of big points left on the board: R12,

or on the bottom:  K3, or o3.];W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq];W[hp];B[eo]C[I think black should go J3. With this move you are getting potential
territory on the bottom. White has a wall, but hard to make territory in the
middle.

Also the cut at J3 is bad for black, as you find out.];W[cm]C[This is  an excellent move for white. 1.) it starts to isolate F5.
2.) It takes territory from black. 3. It builds territory for white.  Since
it is a good move for white,it is good for black.];B[ip];W[gn];B[hn];W[fn]
;B[ho]C[This move H5 is "peeping at bamboo  joints"  There is a go proverb
which warns against this.Also, J3 and J5 are dangerous defect as you find
out.  The groups H3, H4 are involved in a contact fight.  H4 has no
dangerous defects.  Therefore, better to play the solid connection of J3.]
;W[iq];B[jq];W[ir];B[jr];W[hr];B[jo]C[Under other circumstances this would not be a bad move.

You are starting to get a thick wall.However, the wall is  ruined by Whites
Q4.];W[bj];B[cj]C[This move at C10 would better be played  elsewhere.

For example, O3, or R12.

If you want to protect the upper terriorty, then B11 would be better.];W

Evan is right. d8 is an excellent move. I think that can still

kill the the black strings, but if he is not careful G4 dies.]
