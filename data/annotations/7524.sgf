C[Hi! I won this game, but I feel I didn't play too good... I just could kill when I had to :-)
I would please like comments for black's gameplay. I included some insights I had when I replayed the game.

Thanks for the review!!

Manuel

Hi Manuel, 

My name is Philip and I am 4D AGA. I will mark my comments with a P:

As for my overall impressions: Black played well! I think that once the game got complicated, your reading was good. I would say that the most important thing to work on is identifying the correct direction of play. There were several times where black would have benefited from looking at all the stones on the board and how they relate before choosing the next move.]

(;B[dn]LB[dn:A][cq:B]C[I'm not sure if this was a good idea, because I think white can't make a big moyo on the bottom side because of Q3

P: This seems fine for black. I think you could also go into the corner, and it is just a matter of taste.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[gq]
(;B[ep]LB[ep:A][eq:B]C[See variation

P: Actually, I think both moves might be wrong. I added a variation.]
;W[eo];B[eq];W[do]C[P: Now white seems better.]

;W[hr];B[ip];W[jq];B[jp]
(;W[lq]C[P: White can attack the corner here. See variation.]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[kp]C[P: White should still attack the corner.]
;W[mr];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]C[White became extra thick... is there a better way to play here?

P: As mentioned before, black needs to descend when white plays G3.]

(;B[mo]LB[mo:A][np:B]C[I wasn't comfortable with this result... I think white got better out of this sequence. See variation

P: I would just jump to H7 here. I think that black should try to limit white's potential on the left side.]
;W[dj];B[fc]C[P: I'm not sure about this move. I think that it makes it too easy for white to develop the left side. Maybe just K17?]

(;W[ic]C[P: This is wrong. See variation.]
(;B[cc]C[P: This is bad. Black should definitely double approach. See variation.]

(;W[dc]LB[dc:A][cd:B]C[P: As you pointed out, this is of course a mistake.]
;B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[qf];B[nc]C[P: This move is very good. It's important to find moves like this because they serve so many purposes. It protects black's position here, it helps to activate the aji of F17, it makes miai of R17 or L17 if necessary, and it puts pressure on R14.]
;W[rd]
(;B[qc]C[P: Here black needs to attack. See variation.];W[pj]
;B[qh]C[I thought it was time to make use of my bottom stones and also make some trouble, because everything is very stable...

P: This move is correct. White Q10 is an overplay and should be R11.]
;W[of];B[oh];W[mf]
(;B[mh]C[P: This move is an overplay I think. You are encouraging white to attack the top. Just play R6 here... see variation.]
;W[ld];B[qn]C[Is it too thin? I was afraid of giving white the possibility of R7

P: At this point I think you need to just play S17. Besides being worth a lot of points, it would completely protect your top right corner. A white move at S17 would be pretty severe.]
;W[om]
(;B[nj]LB[nj:A][oo:B]C[See variation];W[pp];B[op]C[P: This seems like an overplay. Why not just play R4?]

(;W[qo]C[P: See variation.];B[rn];W[so];B[rr];W[ok]C[P: This is of course bad, white should jump into the center.]

(;B[rj]LB[rj:A][ml:B]C[See variation];W[ll]C[P: Black's center is getting weak now...]
;B[ml];W[mm];B[nl];W[nm];B[ol];W[kn]C[P: White should just play M6]
;B[ko];W[lk]C[P: This is a very bad move. White needs to extend to K6.]

;W[qk];B[rl];W[nk];B[pk];W[km]C[I had only seconds left for the last move and calculated that I could make my group live...but maybe it wasn't a good choice... should I have fought the ko longer so my bottom group could be reenforced?

P: It's difficult to say. White hads a lot of threats, and I think if white wins the ko then black would be behind by a good bit. Connecting is risky but maybe necessary.]

(;B[pl]LB[pl:A][hn:B];W[in]C[P: This is of course the wrong way to attack.]

;B[lg];W[mg];B[mk];W[lj];B[ni];W[lh];B[jr];W[ir];B[mh]C[P: From this point on, black is in control of the game. I think that black played well in overcoming white's advatnage from the beginning. However, white had some chances to win the game that were overlooked. Make sure you be careful during difficult fights, and sometimes it is ok to simply protect and take territory. *End of comments*]
