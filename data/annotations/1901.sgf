C[Greetings, my name is Oliver Richman. I play as kungfu 7k* on IGS. After this game (with playfurfun 2k*) I lost by about 30 points. I played white.

Any comments you have for me would be greatly appreciated, however, I am particularly interested in the aspects of my game (all of them? ._.) which are not up to shodan strength yet. Thanks.

I had some problems with the installation of my new  graphic-card so this review comes a bit late. I hope  you like it anyway!

 kungfu 7k*: Hi!
 playforfun 2k*: hello];W[pd]C[I have been pretty much playing 2 star points as white or black. A comment made in a Go Seigen interview struck me, and I've been aiming at Go Seigen's diagnonal or triangle (i.e. q16, d4 or q4, k10) ever since.]
;B[qf];W[nd]LB[nd:6][nc:a][rd:b]C[An experiment. I usually respond o17.

A play at a means you are thinking of playing tenuki  after black b, as your stone protects the top even after  black takes the 3,3 point. Also it is much more stabile  black is strong at the top.]
;B[rd];W[qc];B[qi];W[rc]LB[ic:a][jc:b][ep:c][nq:d]C[Perhaps not the largest point on the board. Is a, b, c or  d noticeably bigger?

All of them are bigger. You answered black 7 with two  moves to protect your corner so black gained a move  here - You might have made a little more territory but  black at 10 was also gote.

I would play b or c.];B[fc];W[jc];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db]

Black's stones work together very well here and you  have been outplayed. The problem was the jump in the  corner as noted earlier.]

(;W[gp]C[See var.];B[fr];W[co];B[bo];W[do];B[bn]LB[bn:45]C[Your stones make no territory, aren't strong and  present a wonderfull target for black to attack. So you  haven't handled the situation well at all!]

This is good.];B[nf];W[ne];B[qh];W[ng];B[jo]C[Good positional judgment. I'd say the winning move.  Black calmly attacks your group while making profit.  Attacking from the other side might be a stronger  course of action, but since the point of the game is to  win - choosing a safer route is prudent.]

I hope I made the main points clear.

You both forget the rest of the board when you engage  in a fight. Black was ahead throughout the game since  white invaded at q3. I hope i managed to point out the  biggest mistakes in your play and that you will learn  from them.

Send the review to your opponent as I commented on  both sides and let me know if you have some  questions about the game.
