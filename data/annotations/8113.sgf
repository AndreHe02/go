AB[pd][dp]C[Insight [5k\]: Hi
lloyd [2k\]: please enjoy

Hello reviewer,

I am a KGS 5kyu.  This is a fairly-serious game I played versus a strong 2kyu.
We are  playing a 2 stone handicap, so I wonder if I am almost a 4kyu now.
I ask for this game to be reviewed because I believe I played with maturity, but I
would like to know how to play even better (to get to 4kyu, 3kyu, etc.)
This was a very exciting game.  Half the game I had only 2x:30 byo-yomi periods!
Please review for both sides!!
Thank you!

\\m/ : I am KGS 1k-1d so the difference between us is not so deep, please take that into account when reading comments.

This was a nice game, the main point here was giving so much importance to k17 stone. Black would have had an easy game by throwing it in sente to take big corner. 

The biggest mistake is the interpretation of move 70. You call that a free and sente move but in fact, it was this move that brought all the problems in the center.
I don't have time info on this sgf editor so I don't know what happen between the 2 groups in the center, w missed 2 easy liberties problems (you pointed one of them by yourself).

And finally, I congrat you for the nice murder that ends this game ;)]
;W[dc];B[qp];W[oq];B[lp]C[lloyd [2k\]: looks like a VERY old photo--

C[My plan worked as intended, but I am not sure I like the result.  But, I have sente!

\\m/ : This looks terribly good for w. Corner is not so big and cut at r3 could become embarrassing. Though w is not so thick because of the o5 cut. But remember that you have two hoshi stones and answered  w corner kakari with a high pincer, here it's a big changement in the strategy because you take profit but in counterpart, you get enclosed in the corner, lose your pincer stone and nullify the territory gave by r7.]

\\m/ :  agree, in fact 34 (s17) would be a good answer to 35 (m17) and w could use sente to develop top. Here w didn't need 35 for make you playing 34 so this area not so interesting now and it is better to reinforce top left corner]

\\m/ : good :)];W[ib]LB[ge:A]TR[dc][dd][de]MA[cc][cd][ce]C[Insight [5k\]: be RIGHT back
lloyd [2k\]: ok

I feel this is a mistake for White.  The three stones are more important.  I did not think I could mount an effective attack on the M17/N16 group because White was strong near-by, so I focused on the other side of the board.  Should I have attacked the J18 stone  from the left-side to build thickness so I could more easily attack the 3 stones, or is the one space jump more important?  Please show how to attack the J18 stone if it's best.

\\m/ : refering to Kageyama's "Lessons of the fundamentals of go" ยง Stones go walking, you can't let the 3 marqued stones in this position, the 1st to hane at the head of the stones will make good shape while forcing the other into bad one.]

Insight [5k\]: ty sir
lloyd [2k\]: got it

I am happy since White hurt his stones and got little cash in return.

\\m/ : connecting means w  is ambitious, wants to kill f17 with 2 weak groups]
(;B[kc]TR[eb][gb][hb][ib][dc][hc][dd][de]C[Here I am thinking stratigically.  If White is split into two weak groups, and I attack well, surely one will die!

\\m/ : right, but h18 not so important and you should already be happy that w connect ending in bad shape and giving you sente. Note that k17 already placed on the vital point, no need to add one stone here. Better to concentrate your attack on d17 (see var.)

Otherwise, I don't think that playing for killing something is correct stratigically speaking. Because if the kill fails, you're not sure to have good enough compensation.]

(;B[dj]C[I attacked from this side to follow the proverb: "Make profit while attacking!"

\\m/ : but it doesn't respect the proverb "push from weak position to strong one" and as we see in the game the attacker become the attackee because you push w on weaker f14 group]
;W[ej]C[Should I push or hane?

\\m/ : nothing wrong with being pushed from behind on the 4th line (so called line of victory). Hane not bad too, it just demands more carefully reading]
;B[ek];W[di];B[fj]C[I thought F10 was an easy move.  It is free sente move.

How should I respond to this?  I thought E3 was a solid move that attacks the F3 stone while securing the corner.

\\m/ : f3 is small but may be needed because of the thinness of the w dragon. w would like to jump into the corner but this is too dangerous now.  E3 is a contact move, so it's not an attack as you make both black and white stronger, it's still a good defensive move to protect the corner though ^^]
