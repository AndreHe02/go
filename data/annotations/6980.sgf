C[My (seeker's) comments will be several lines lower than the banter.

Hi

I am Radu Ux, active player on DGS and LG (around 10k). I am happy to comment your game.
My notes will be prefixed by "R:". Also please watch for possible alternatives I am drawing.]
;B[gg]C[auedon1 [-\]: hi



Dumb, thought I was playing 9x9 for a sec.];W[jd]C[Seeker [?\]: hi gg.]
;B[di]C[R: too close to the center stone. I can understand that the first move was a little unwanted, but at least make use of it.
Being central, best use is influence. And influence means large gaps between stones.]
;W[jk]C[R: good answer. It marks first option for the corner and threats sliping under D5.]
;B[ji]C[



Seemed okay a move.

R: not to me. Several reasons:
1. it doesn't provide a base for B. Maybe B is already looking as a big group, but without a bsae is helpless agaisnt W having alread y2 bases after 2 moves.
2. It doesn't extend influence anywhere. W already claimed the most of the right side.
3. Bigger points (D10) waiting.
4. It forces W strengthen on low side (H3), attacking left low corner and to cut the B stones.]

(;W[ki]C[R: I wouldn't attack in contact. B has the chance getting solid. See variation]
;B[kh]CR[kg][jj]TR[dd][dk]SQ[jh]C[R: in tis particular situation, I would play it at K6 (rectangle). Although it would allow W large extensions (circle) later, it would eventually provide sente for playing big points (triangles). Playing hane would require defense against the aji and so loosing the sente. Initiative is essential in fuseki.]
;W[kj];B[gj]CR[kg][jh][ii]C[R: nasty B ajis. W has no one.]
;W[cd];B[dd]C[



Maybe playing too close, or wasa it a good intimidation by blocking him?

R: I never attack in contact, at least during intial phases.
Here esp. I feel it wrong. B continues lack any kind of base while W captures the sides one by one.]
;W[dc]C[R: good];B[ce];W[ed];B[ee]C[R: even more aji for B. W can mount attacks almost everywhere. B should simply connect.]
;W[de];B[df];W[bd];B[dd]C[





Wanted the Ko

R: for what? W already captured the corner, now it takes the up side with F10 in the same time securing further right up corner (4x4 stone was too weak to protect alone the corner). D3 is vital in this moment. If B misses it I don't see where B will have teritory.

Yes, it si a KO, but really not interesting. A KO matter when it makes more than 1 point, as this one :)]
;W[fd]C[R: perfect];B[de]C[



Maybe closed the Ko too soon.

R: that ko has no relevance. D3 is vital.];W[hk]C[R: look for the big points. D3 is the biggest. Although H3 gains a number of points (around 12), it si not by far so big. And the corner group is strong enough for this stage of the game. It doesn't need more power. The area is already crowded.]
;B[ik]C[R: bold, but useless. G3, as simple as it looks, defends the corner and enclose a large are.]
;W[il];B[ij]LB[kc:6][hd:3][jf:4][lh:5][dk:1][gk:2]C[





b25 good or bad?

R: B shouldn't be here in the first place. I ranked the best moves (in my vision)]
;W[ck]C[





And I pay the price for ignoring the lower left

R: good catch. Still i would vote D3: works better with right wing. B has the chance to "cut" at D3 or E3 and reduce the loosing.]
;B[dk]C[R: good]
(;W[dl]C[R: one direction (good), lot of good alternatives,]
;B[el]C[R: tricky move. This double hane asks W what wants: corner or side. I would go for corner: on the side fewer points]

(;W[ek]C[R: W choice is side];B[dj]C[





But I recover a bit...]
(;W[fl]C[R:  still W could choose corner giving up E3]
(;B[fk]C[R: and B cedes the corner too!!!];W[em]
(;B[ej]
(;W[el]C[






More Ko

R: not sure this is also relevant. W could simply ignore.];B[gk]
;W[gl];B[hj];W[hl]C[R: ok, maybe it is time both player count. Already fuseki is over since W invasion at C3, last point in fuseki.
B has... dunno, I think B can count on life in center, and maybe 5 to 10 points. While W has +20 points on bottom and 17 points left up and maibe 10 points in right (side or corner, depends on B attack). So a total of 10 to 47. As B I could only hope in big gains b yattacking blindly every point while as White I would just defend, let as few aji as possible (even by loosing points, there are plenty ahead) and close all doors.






This point I figure he'll take lower right so I try to decrease that territory as much as possible.]
;B[jj]C[R: a first B's attack. Well, not an attack, W can tenuki. Close the doors: H11 I would say.]
;W[kl];B[li];W[lj];B[mi]C[R: this is an end move. It shouldn't be played now. Simply because W can ignore and take really large points. 
So another opportunity for tenuki. W HAS to punish B and take big.]
;W[mj]C[R: well, maybe not...];B[lg];W[ke]C[R: W makes good move. Still I would go for H11 rather L9. L9 is looks more offensive, and W has no reason to attack. Moreover, it doesn't protect well the corner.
If the situation would be more even, yes, this is the right move: makes a solid group facing the left strong group, inviting B invade on side and maybe inflict large casualties.






Now the battle is upper right];B[le];W[ld]C[R: good];B[md]C[R: oooops, B looses another group]

(;W[mc]C[R: What?]
(;B[me]C[R: B misses the opportunity of gaining initiative






Bn9... suicide. Dang.];W[lf];B[mf];W[mg]
(;B[mh]C[R: self atari? I think this is hurting, to give a group like this... B should play here, otherwise W would capture.]
;W[lh]C[







Double suicide!];B[jg]CR[kg]C[R: why? Best move: H10 or H9. But even if deciding to save something here, why not simply connect?]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[jh];B[ih];W[ci]LB[bj:2][cj:1]C[R: hmmm, again bold, but useless. Best move now: H10 or H9. If playing in this area, 1 or 2 are good choices.]

(;B[ch]C[R: nope, B misses a big chance];W[bi];B[bh];W[cj];B[ai]
C[R: another yose move. When there are available big points don't even think of these. Althoug this is kind of sente (W has to answer, and to answer with care), it is not "appropriate"]
;W[aj]C[R: maybe





Maybe I have a chance...];B[ah];W[af]
(;B[ae]C[R: useless. W has a monkey here, but already uneffective because B has no big teritory here.]
;W[be]C[R: good.





Desperation set in here...];B[gd]C[R: finaly in the area. Not so good: again attack in contact.]
;W[gc];B[gb]C[R: hmmm, don't get it. It is complicated, but W could simplify everything with H11.]

(;W[hd]TR[cc][ec][fc][hc]C[R: W should close and defend. When being so far ahead, don't take risks. This ate is a risk because after B defend W leaves aji behind: triangles. Why risk?]
;B[fc]C[R: hmmm, B should first defend and after attack!];W[ge]
;B[ec]
(;W[fb]C[R: oh no! This is big error.];B[eb]C[R: not yet. W still can come back.






Oh? What this? A chance?]
(;W[hb]C[R: oh no, the other way];B[fa]C[R: still W should kill.





Meh, one cap. Let's see where it leads.];W[db];B[cb]
(;W[da]C[R: B should send big thank to W. W made 3 major mistakes in the row to allow B live.]
;B[cc]
(;W[bc]C[Nope, it is the best move in this situation. Although could be too late.





W 90, huge mistake!]
(;B[ca];W[bb];B[ea]C[R: B has life after 3 major mistakes of W. Anyone played differently, B would be dead.
W should make life in corner now. It's up to B to kill W.





Like so];W[ba];B[bf]C[R: yeap, that's kiliing W!];W[ad]
(;B[ag]C[R: oh no, now it is B turn to offer life to W.];W[ab]
C[R: yes, W makes life];B[ae]C[R: not interesting... yose move]
;W[ha];B[ic]C[auedon1 [-\]: good moves, you stole that from me :-)


R: where is the cut? W should block easily.




Wee! found a cut!];W[hc]C[Seeker [?\]: I think youll win tho]
;B[id];W[ie]C[Seeker [?\]: this mis only my 4th game
auedon1 [-\]: yes, hard to win with no corners

R: W defends correctly.];B[ak]C[Seeker [?\]: one lasy gasp
auedon1 [-\]: if you go to the brginner's room there is a very good web site in the window there with a set of tutorial problems

R: I already discussed this sitaution.



Despite us agreeing that I would lose, my last gasp actually profited!]
;W[bj]C[R: W is gready and looses.];B[cl]C[Seeker [?\]: thx]
;W[cm]
(;B[bk]C[R: why hurry? I suppose you didn't even wait the opp [place the stone. Just relax. Don't you think a better move is available? ;)

auedon1 [-\]: looks like I should go there to learn how to defend :-)




I wasn't even planning to do that. "Mind your liberties" I guess.]
;W[bl];B[ck]
(;W[bm]LB[jc:2][je:1][kf:3]C[R: not needed. Should close aji around. Just in case. When I am in front, when I can tenuki, I am using it to close weakness points not because gaining a point or 2, but to eliminate possible bad attacks. Mt attention could be distracted in the future...]
;B[al];W[ff];B[am]C[R: yose move, think to bigger one.];W[dm]
;B[fe];W[gd];B[gf]C[R: good one.];W[hf];B[hg];W[if];B[ig]C[R: W now has to connect K9, it is vital.]
;W[kh];B[je]C[R: oops, W is about to loose the game. Now B goes for sure killing. Good catch.]
;W[he]
(;B[jc];W[kd];B[ib];W[kc];B[ia];W[jb];B[ga];W[ja]C[R: hey, L12]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[ka];W[la];B[jb]C[R: B gives one point. For free. Really not needed, moreover it is ocupying 1 point in teritory.]
;W[kf];B[fg]C[R: another one not needed.];W[tt];B[tt]TW[aa]

[hf][if][bg][cg][dg][eg][dh][eh][fh][gh][hh][bi][ci][ei][fi]
[gi][hi][ii][aj][bj][cj][fj]C[R: a short game, but still
1. For W: adjust the style to the situation. In the middle of the game W was in advantage with over 30 points and has no obvious aji. Play safe in such situation, don't initiate attacks, just close the door and watch your back.
Also, even if loosing there and here, count again, take a deep breath and focus on the next target. In the end I have the feeling that W just played to give up the turn, o matter where. After making life in left up corner, except the initial defence in center, nothing was played right. 
2. For B. This win is lying. In fact, B didn't win, W lost. That's all.
You need to work for a base. Always ask yourself: does my group live? what side / corener is free to take? Not that aiming for lkarge teritories on sides would solve all problems, but having a base makes a group strong and powerfull. In fact, watch the W moves (until D13) and try to see what W did and you didn't.
3. For both players: read. Read the situation again and again. There are 2 kinds of reading: count the score and lay out the alternatives.
Counting the score is always giving the style to apply: go blindly attacking if far behind; defend solid rather than preserving points if far in front; play balanced if even.
Laying out the possible moves is the only way one knows before playing what will happen, and can make the right decisions.  Develop the normal situation, see who wins. Go back and change the last move of that part until find one leading to better result. If not, go back again. After finding such move, change the opponent move that again to change the result. Again and again. Until sure that almost all moves were exhausted. And even then, I bet that many times the "clever" move is somewhere ouside.
For this I recommend you the book "The Game of Go" by Matthew Macfadyen.



auedon1 [-\]: well done
Seeker [?\]: WOW.
auedon1 [-\]: good luck with your game





I have no delusions that I was better than him. If it weren't for his mistakes I'd have lost.

So there we have it. I look forward your analysis on our performance.

Thank you and have fun.
