MaTo: Yo, this is my first review other than in live situations, hope this helps.]
;W[nc]C[Caissa [12k\]: saol]
(;B[oc]C[MaTo: This is a move that is ment to make white heavy, but if it doesn't do that then it just makes white strong and thats something you dont want to do. 

This would make white heavy and be the correct move, if you had a stone around K16 already.

In this situation you should either play a pincer, or make a normal extension.]
;W[nd]
(;B[qf];W[jc]
(;B[gc]C[MaTo: White's group is strong now so you cant really pressure it so you shouldn'd play this far out.]
;W[db]C[MaTo: This is quite a bad move from white. It is too early and should just be played from the more open side.

And again think of those stones as a wall not so much about the territory.]
(;B[cc];W[fc];B[fb];W[ec]
(;B[dc]C[MaTo: Sorry to be blunt, but this is an example of a very bad move :)

This only hurts yourself by making you have to protect your F18 stone, you completely lose the initiative with this.]
;W[eb];B[gb];W[gd]
(;B[fd]C[MaTo: This cut is too much, the black stones are weak on both sides.]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[ee];B[hd]C[MaTo: White should just take the corner here.]

(;W[qn]C[MaTo: This is not exactly bad but this is still something that black can ignore without losing much. When in this kind of ko situation white should rather play a tsuke in the corner.]
;B[ea];W[nq]
(;B[qq]C[MaTo: This is a bad move in almost all situations, here it is a bit better than normally since black can for the most part nullify the power of the wall white gets, but it would still be better to come out and split white.]
;W[oo];B[po];W[pn];B[or];W[nr];B[op];W[np];B[oq];W[rp];B[rq]
;W[nn];B[hp]C[MaTo: An excellent move by black just the right distance from cornerstone and wall. Was surprised to see this good a move from a 12k. :)]
;W[fp]
(;B[fq]C[MaTo: This isnt how we want to continue it though.]
;W[eq]
(;B[dq]C[MaTo: F3 is a connecting move, and a crosscut is usually used for connecting in a situation like this.]
;W[fr];B[er];W[gq]C[MaTo: allowing this ponnuki in the open like this is really bad for black.]
;B[kp];W[jq];B[jp];W[gm]
(;B[ej]C[MaTo: This is bad. Black doesnt need these stones and should not make moves like these to capture them. White doesn't yet have any territory on the board at all, while black has quite a lot of it. even if white uses moves to get these stones free, he wont be making any territory with them so it doesn't matter.]
;W[cm];B[cj]C[MaTo: The corner seems really bad now.];W[bp]
C[Caissa [12k\]: :)]
(;B[cn]C[baris [4k\]: adamlar her yere taş atıyolar böle

MaTo: Trying to capture white B4 with this isnt good and if youre trying to get out with this it's too early.]

(;B[ls]C[MaTo: The corner is still alive.];W[mq];B[ms];W[ns]
C[MaTo: This killed the corner.

Overall, white lost this game by this much, because of playing too heavy and going too deep too early, and then trying to go for too much, or just not seeing the opportunities.
