Better are simple moves like R14, O3 or R6.];B[le];W[me];B[hd]
C[Why this move? It's aji keshi.];W[gd];B[lg]C[The normal idea of M15 is to play N14 now. If this dosen't work, M14 instead of M15 would be better shape. (b M14, w N14, b N13, w O14, b M13)]

C[White asked about loosing winning positions.
I think this is such a moment.  White is clearly in the lead. He has secure territory around
F16, B11 and T18. The M15 group has a strong shape. And white
has the D4 and K4 formation.
Black has territory around B18 and M18. But this is smaler than
the white territory. The stones around E12 are drifting.
It is now "just" a question of nursing this lead. :-)];B[fp]
;W[fq]C[D6 is simpler. If one is in the lead it is best to play
simple and avoid complicated fighting.];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[do]

;B[pe];W[qh];B[rg];W[rh];B[sf];W[og]C[From the definite leading position till now white did
choose a bold strategy. He gave black territory aund secure
groups for a mojo. This might be fun. :-) And it might fit to
whites strong points. It seems that white welcomes fighting as
in the sequence from B14 to C10.
But this moyo has a lot of weaknesses like the cutting points
K7 and L4.];B[ok];W[mm];B[mk];W[kk];B[pi];W[pc];B[oc];W[qq]
C[This could be strategically the loosing move.
White is busy to defend his moyo. So it is not wise to install
another battleplace which is going to hurt his framework.];B[oq]

H7 is sente, threatening moves like H3, and white should be able
to surround a lot of territory around H10.];B[gr];W[gp];B[hp]
