C[Jadoube :

Hi,

I feel fairly ok about the earlier parts of this game. (i.e. I'm not good enough to know better.) The middle game went badly wrong. I think this is due first to overconfidence and later to panic when I feel i'm throwing the game away. Please can your review give suggestions for safer ways to have played the middle game]
