C[Hi,
   I'm Anand and I'm about 11kyu on IGS. I lost this game by about 10 points. Please point out any mistakes you might see.

Generally my style is to try to build a framework and invite the opponent in. However, when confronted by the san-ren-sei opening, I like to take profit in the corner.

In this game my opponent built up a big framework and I couldn't seem to reduce it enough.

Please give comments on:

a) Reducing / Invading
b) Endgame

I have added some comments in the game file.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[kc]C[I'm used to the one-space pincer. I just played the normal invasion joseki, but I'm wondering if this is loose and I could've played something else.

*Due to the q10 stone, the 3.3 invasion here is fairly good for black. There are other options.  The key to note is that the one point pincer is actually a better idea here. So you want to capitalize this slightly weaker play by dividing these stones later. If you take the invasion, you should have an eye towards the eventual weaknesses. An alternate way to play follows.]
(;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me]LB[ld:A]C[*A is a weak point. You don't have to attack it now, but bank these weak points for later in the game.]
;W[nq];B[kq]LB[pn:A][qn:B]C[*Playing out the same sequence here is not good. Two walls over the central area is two much influence. 
A or B would be where I would play.]
(;W[qq]C[Again the two-space pincer.];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr]
;B[mo];W[mj]C[To reduce the framework. I just played here because of the sector line of N5 and N15. Could I have played O10?

Please point out some ideas to reduce black.

*Part of the problem with reducing black at this point is that you've already made him Very Strong with your double invasion attack. It's hard to play here without encouraging black to make great profit. 

If you want to play something that's hard to kill, and will eat up some of black's territory, you could try a crazy invasion under the q10 stone. 

Any invasion played here will need great fighting strength to see a way out. It's hard to say what to do in this situation, since the double all is so heavily influencing everything. 

If you do want to reduce, it's important not to play heavily, and play light, easy to abandon moves.]
;B[ni]
(;W[nj]C[*All of  the next few moves makes black earn territory, while defending obvious moves.
For that reason alone, I'd say this is too heavy and slow.

Go isn't a game of shoving against solidarity. You can't cut here, so it's better not to push against it. Some other options..]

Take a moment here, and look at the board.

;B[ef];W[co]C[Good kick.];B[dn]
(;W[fp]C[Bad followthrough. In this case, the L3 stone, while it doesn't allow an imediate bothering of the high play, invites a followup of H3, threatening to undercut your group. In fact, I'd ignore C/D6 and play H3 right now if I were black.

*Loose, no, ineffective, yes. Black has pretty definitively made the stones you played against live. Unless you're planning to follow up with m4 and threaten the bottom, which is unwise with g3 floating, this is a pretty slow move. 

Attacking the top would be a better idea.];B[bc]C[Any comments on how to attack the top black group?]

;W[ec];B[fd];W[ee]C[*Not uh.. sure what this is for. It's a neat ko threat, but, you're not surrounding these stones, so setting them up for eye reduction is kinda pointless. 

The saying 'make a fist before striking' includes more than just making yourself thick before attacking. In a very real way, when attacking something you should ask yourself some questions.

Can I surround this?
If the answer is No, Can I pressure it and make profit while threatening to surround it? 
If the answer is Yes, can I reduce its eyes to less than 2? 
If I can, then attack to kill. 
If not, let it go. 

If you can't surround it, and you can't make profit while threatening it, then you shouldn't attack it at all.]

65, give or take a few if you get good sente. 

Black, in contrast, is carrying, @80 points. Notice, that's if you get all sorts of sente moves, and he gets all sorts of sente moves. In general, these sorts of evaluation of sente moves and the final values of the game take a lot of heavy math that I can't do in my head. But, my point is, with the game this solid, an expectation to make up 15 points is really unreasonable. Add to that the fact that your upper group is badly in need of defense against a ko fight you don't want, and this game is, by now, resignable. You play well to recover it back to 10 points. 

Your main mistakes were, I feel, made in the opening few move, with the double 3.3, allowing him to get the double wall formation, then pressuring to force him to turn that into Big Cash in the very early game. By the time you're fighting on the left, you need to be fighting all or nothing fights that you're just not equipped for.]
