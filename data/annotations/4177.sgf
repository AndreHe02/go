C[Black: Statue 22k
White: KikeCh 20k

Statue: Ok, I won this game by resignation, and I was very proud of the win, but I have a few questions.

1) I tried a different approach with this game.. I wanted to play strong and defensive, and I think it worked well, but perhaps you could point out what I did right?  I would like to know what kind of things I need to continue doing to get stronger.

2) I noted a few moves in question where I was unsure of wether to tenuki or not.  Please advise.

3) Why did he resign?  Was W really in that bad of a situation? Why?

(;B[di]C[CB> Why leave the corner to your opponent ? Always think coners>sides>center.]

(;W[kd]C[CB> The situation in the corner is not settled, white should take it.]
;B[cd];W[jp]C[CB> White could approach the back stone, it's better than letting black have a corner enclosure.]
;B[nq];W[pn];B[pk]C[CB> good - two aims: pressure on Q6 and territory on the right side]
;W[pi]LB[mn:B][no:A]C[CB> white is jealous - but now he's got two weak groups - As white, I would have played at A or B before trying to invade on the right side if needed.]

(;B[nl]C[CB> here you can try to put more pressure on the Q6 stone]
;W[nn]
(;B[ll]C[CB> better make shape right now - white made tenuki and was right, your move does not threaten anything]
;W[pf];B[nd]C[CB> when facing the opponent, prefer low moves - here, you could also answer at R14]

(;W[rd]C[CB> bad shape.]
(;B[qc]C[CB> no, I think you should take profit of the bad shape right now]
;W[rc]
(;B[le]C[Here I chose to let him take territory on the wall, and for me to take influence and put pressure on Q11 and Q14.  Was this the best thing to do?

CB> I'm not sure... the best thing to do at this point would still be to exploit white's  weakness at R15. Or at least to first make life on the edge because if white corrects its weakness (by playing Q15), he'll also have influence in the same area, cancelling yours.]
;W[mc];B[nc]C[Here, I figured M15 was good enough to break into the middle with this group, and I might still have a shot at the corner if I were to make the group stronger.  I wonder though if I could have made a bigger move elsewhere.

CB> this move is ok];W[md];B[me]
(;W[nb]C[CB> this is a yose move that looses sente - so a bad move.]
;B[ob];W[lb];B[cn]C[CB> good];W[dl];B[cq]C[Here I wasnt sure if I should try to jump back against my group on the side, or go for the corner.  I finally chose the corner because I felt I had enough strength on the side to handle an attack.

(;W[fq];B[bp];W[bo]
(;B[br]C[Here I was afraid of W F2.  Is that fear warranted? And could I have avoided that weakness without putting too much pressure on D11?

(;B[ck]C[Was it correct to tenuki from that bottom group now?  I read somewhere that in the beginning I should tenuki at the first possible chance.  Also, is there a bigger point I should have looked into?

CB> yes... R15... ;-) You can also try to start some fight, see var.

CB> also, locally, it's often not very good to approach with a low keima a stone on the fourth line (because it's seldom sente) - so your move would be better at C10 for instance.]
;W[cl];B[bk];W[bl];B[cc]C[CB> ok, this is big, but you leave some aji on the left side for W]

;W[sj]C[Here, I chose to kill the S7 stones, for two reasons.  One, I didnt feel I needed to allow W that strong ko threat, and two, I was really unsure what he was attempting with T10.

CB> there is a third reason which looks bigger for me: it connects all your stones]
;B[sm];W[jf];B[ld];W[lc];B[ke]C[CB> M16 and this move just reinforce him - they are kikachis that don't need to be played now.]
;W[je];B[jd]LB[ln:A][lo:B]C[CB> so you payed the kikachis to play this move? even if it works it's too soon - plus, nowyou can attack white with a move at A or B.]

(;W[ie]C[CB> unnecesarry empty angle];B[lh];W[mf]C[CB> W should play Q15 or try to concretize his moyo in the SW instead of this move]

;B[qh];W[rh];B[qi];W[qd]C[again, I chose to kill R10 stones and lose some in the corner, it worked out in my favor, but I feel largely that was from a misplay on W's part.  What would have been a better play?

(;W[jh]C[CB> too small];B[jj]C[CB> you leave L11, better play M10 if you want to close your moyo]
;W[fi];B[ek]LB[cj:B][ck:A]C[With this move, I felt W was trying to contain me and gain more center influence with F11.  Is there a better option?  I end up losing 2 stones and giving W some territory I would have rather kept.

CB> I pointed out sooner the reason why you loose this two stones, it's your move at A that should have been at B. Also, better reduce W's influence with something around J7, or attack south-west white stones with M5]
;W[fk];B[el];W[em];B[fl];W[fm];B[gk];W[fj]
(;B[gl]C[CB> To avoid loosing the two stones, you can also play like in the var.]

;W[fe]C[CB> again, very small.];B[db];W[eb];B[ec]LB[hb:1][se:4]
[bf:A][hg:2][ni:B][eo:3][sp:D][hs:C]C[This is where he resigned.  I know he lost alot by being greedy with D17, but is his situation really impossible?  I dont fully understand.  Thank you again for helping me.

CB> Even without capturing white stones at the south-west, you are far ahead by somehting like 30 points.

Let's try to evaluate roughly the situation:

A ~ 25 points
B ~ 35 points
C ~ 20 points
D ~ 20 points

=> 100 points for black

1 ~ 20 points
2 ~ 10 points
3 ~ 30 points
4 ~ 10 points

=> 70 points for white

Or you can go faster without counting by noticing that:

A ~ 1
B ~ 3

so white is left with 2 and 4, which are obviously smaller than C+D.

But of course, White could keep fighting to try to come back, and should you be in his position in another game, I would encourage you to do so, since combativity can sometimes be enough to win lost games!

Cheers,

Claude])
(;B[lo]C[CB> now white has some troubles... it's quite complex but you've got a cutting point at L4 plus another one around N4 so W should not be able to escape. The two sequences I show are certainly not optimal and there may be others, but I don't really see now how W could escape.]
