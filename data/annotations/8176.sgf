C[I'm Black, and my biggest is really openings and good moves that can lead into the center.

dc: Hi, I'm dancor and I'll prefix my comments with "dc:".  I'll review for both sides and try to say what is weak in the play to study next to get stronger.  However, you as Black win by 40 points in this game, which is a huge landslide.  It's usually more fruitful to identify weak areas in a game where you lose or a close game than in a landslide victory.  I would recommend that eventually you submit another game, such as a close losing game where it was hard to understand what went wrong.  I have comments throughout and a summary in my final comment.]

;B[pq];W[dd];B[pm]C[dc: The simplest move might be closer to Q5 or R5 to enclose the corner more simply.  Simplicity is usually espectially desirable in a handicap game where your higher-ranked opponent is trying to create complexities.]
;W[fq];B[iq];W[qo]C[dc: A move around wD10 is better direction here from the white enclosure.]
;B[po];W[qp];B[qq]C[dc: bQ4 feels better to me.  Usually you don't fight if you don't have to, especially against a higher-rated opponent.  Letting white push at wQ4 feels reckless locally.]

C[Blacks move here wasn't thought out it is something I need to work on.

dc: Always try to do a "final check" of each move.  For a brief period after you have chosen a move, ask yourself if there is a simple opponent response that undoes what the move was meant to do.]
;W[rp];B[qg];W[qi];B[ob]C[dc: This is usually bad direction.  Extending out around bK16 develops your enclosure correctly.  Or a move around bD10 to prevent your opponent from developing their enclosure.  Remember, opening on the 4-4 point at Q16 means that you shouldn't be thinking about getting that corner territory any time soon.  Enclosures from 3-4 naturally claim corner territory (like wC4 and wF3 do), but the natural continuation from the 4-4 point is to develop along the sides and create outward influence away from the corner.  If the opponent grabs a small amount of corner territory and you get a strong outward-facing wall, then you have done exactly what you want from the 4-4 opening.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[pb];W[qb];B[sc]
TR[pd][qd][re]C[this move here was more of a gamble for me. I saw a weak spot and went for it but wasn't sure of these two groups.

dc: It does work.  But if you didn't know if was going to work by reading it out fully, you should usually take the less risky route of waiting on a kill attempt and developing your outward strength.  A kill attempt you haven't read out is a risk, and you should only take risks when you feel you have to.  If you can win slowly without risk, that is much better on average than trying to win spectacularly without being sure.]

(;B[id]C[Mouse slip

dc: Heh, a practical issue, but a very important one.  White is getting a lot more in the center than they should have in compensation for their tactical error of dying in the corner.  Perhaps trying to force yourself to "check" each move will also help to focus on accurate clicking as well.]
;W[jd];B[jc]C[dc: At least Black keeps the side intact despite the mistake.]
;W[je];B[lf]C[dc: This feels too soon.  The whole left side is unclaimed.  A move around D10 is urgent.]

;W[mr];B[jr];W[kr];B[lq];W[ir];B[hr];W[js];B[hq];W[lr];B[pl]
;W[pk];B[oj];W[ok]C[dc: It is very bad for black locally for white to push out like this.  The two stones bP10 and bQ8 being cut by wP9 and wQ9 is a local shape that you should never forget.  It is the epitome of an extremely close-contact fight gone extremely bad for Black locally, the ultimate disconnection.  bP9 was better than bP10.  Black has the resource of bS12 to live, or can win a capturing race in the corner against the wS18 stones with three liberties.]
;B[pj];W[qj];B[cf];W[ci]C[dc: White gets a beautiful pincer which also works with the enclosure below!]

;B[hc];W[gc];B[hb];W[gb];B[ic]C[dc: Too early, this defensive move is small.  Practice life and death problems to read out when defensive moves are needed.]
;W[hg];B[ji];W[lj];B[jk];W[ll]C[dc: This is great for Black, pushing White in the strong Black wall below while making a new Black wall facing the unsettled left area.  It is rare to see a 10k player using the influence of walls well!]
;B[eh];W[dl];B[km];W[io];B[ip];W[ho];B[es]C[dc: This is a nice monkey jump.  It looks like White will have to fall back quite a bit or risk a big ko.]
;W[er];B[fs];W[ds];B[dr]C[this move was a gamble i really had no idea what i was doing or trying for. i do many gambles]

(;W[gr];B[dp];W[dq];B[cq]
(;W[ep];B[bp];W[do];B[co];W[bq];B[dp];W[se]C[dc: Even if Black ignores wT15 and White takes at wT18, White does not have two eyes when Black then plays bT16.  This is a fairly simple life and death problem, so I would recommend studying them a bit to improve your play in these situations.  This is a false threat by White and you should just connect at bC4 to win the ko fight now.]
;B[sf];W[cp];B[rm];W[so];B[rl]C[trying to force him to lose focus on the ko fight maybe throw him of his rythme while keeping sente

dc: It's better to save ko threats.  You are better off immediately playing again in the ko fight.  To win a ko fight you need more sufficiently-big ko-threats than your opponent.  Playing two in a row without playing in the ko effectively loses one of your ko threats for no reason!  Of course you can try to "psyche-out" or "distract" your opponent, but you don't get very far in the ranks if you can't keep track of a simple single ko fight, so a trick as simple as that isn't going to go very far.  Also, tricks in general carry risk, and good players try to win without risk first, and only turn to risky ideas when they feel it is the only way.]
;W[pn];B[dp];W[sb];B[eq]C[here i chose to give a more cushioning to the ko fight. try to protect the more important ko

dc: You should just win the ko by connecting at bC4.  Black lives after that -- Black has a lot of eyespcae: in the corner and with room to pour out toward bC6.  Life and death problems should help with this kind of thing.  You end up connecting at bC4 later anyway, but by not connecting there now White is left with a chance of getting back to the ko fight.  The chance is small, but as you get better these small difference become the essence of the game.]

;W[hk];B[il];W[hl];B[im];W[li];B[hh]C[dc: White has completely failed to challenge Black's connection.  White definitely needed to take more risks of being disconnected in order to try to disconnect Black, since White is behind.  The strangest thing about this game is Black taking risks while ahead and White not taking risks while behind.  It is very important to tailor your playing style to the state of the board.

This is my last comment.  Good luck studying life and death, optimally developing from 4-4 vs 3-4 corner openings, playing ko fights simply, avoiding local disconnection, taking risks when and only when appropriate, reading out fights, and not risking everything when you can't see ahead.  But most of all, simply check your moves before playing them.]
