C[--- Hi. My name is Vinyoo. I will be reviewing your game.]
;B[pd]C[Acolyte974 [8k\]: hf];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[fq];W[nc]
;B[qk]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[the better move is here or for complete the overture, or R14/M17 for surround the corner?

--- The most common move would be Q14 or R14. Black move at R9 is a bit too far from the corner to help Q16.

M17 is another alternative. But with the white stone at D17, the direction of future expansion might be a bit limited. If white stone is at D16 or C16, playing at M17 is fine also.]
;W[jd]C[--- White did not take the advantage to attack black corner's stone.

White could play Q14 or R14 instead.];B[lc]C[i play it move wait a direct attack of White.
My question is: M17 was a good move (i too think in O15, but i dont know)? See the variations.


--- Black is outnumbered here. He should  not jump in to M17 directly.

Black should play Q14 first. Then, he can jump in at M17 later.

O15 for black is a very unusal move. It neither attack white nor protect the corner nor gain territory.]

(;W[ne]C[--- This move is OK for white. Separate black and pressure the corner stone.]
;B[pf];W[pb];B[le];W[mf];B[kd]TR[lc][le]C[--- This is a bad shape.

You should play M14 to get out into the center fisrt.]
(;W[jc]C[--- I would prefer playing K15 since black at K15 is quite bad for white.]
;B[je]C[--- This is very good for black.];W[qe]TR[jc][jd]C[--- The marked white group is quite week now since white goes somewhere else. 

Black should aim to attack it later.]
(;B[od]C[--- No need to be fancy here. Just connect at Q15 is better. See variation.

As you can see later, even with black stone at P16, white can still cut black.]
;W[nd];B[qd];W[qf];B[qg];W[rg]C[--- You should play P14 now to prevent white cutting off.]
;B[qh]
(;W[rh]C[--- Instead of this move, white can cut off black now. See vairation.]

(;B[qi]TR[pb][nc][nd][ne][mf]C[I think that its move was a wrong... maybe P14. See the variations in S12.

--- You need to play at P14. Keep corner black stones alive is a must. Later on, you may look to play R18 to attack the marked white group.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[of];B[re];W[rf];B[pg];W[rd]
(;B[kp]LB[cn:A][dn:B]TR[lc][kd][je][le]C[--- This black more is normally placed at K4. It gives some balances and a good framework at the bottom.

However, white ignore your approach move to the lower left corner earlier. You should attack with either C6 or D6. This is espcially true since you are behind quite a lot with the lost corner.

J15 is also a good spot for white. So, alternatively, you may consider attack white's 2 stones with J16. See variation.]
;W[dn]C[--- Now white defends. So, black lost the chance.];B[de]
;W[cg];B[fe]LB[ce:A]C[--- White can still cross under black and connect his group at C15.

The normal Joseki is black C17.];W[fc];B[eh]LB[fo:A]C[--- This move is a bit slack. You should expand your bottom framework at F5 instead.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[dj];B[fk]C[--- Now white got 4th-line territory. There is a proverb that 4th-line is a "Line of Victory". So, in most case, you should think twice before giving that to your opponent.]
;W[fp]LB[gp:A][cq:B]C[--- The normal response would be A. 

In this case, you should consider jumping into the corner at B to break up white's territory.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[hq]LB[gp:A]C[You need to play A here.];W[dq]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[gc]C[--- This is not a good move as you can see in the continuation. 

You should not play a move that got captured immediately without good reasons. Normally, you sacrifice a stone to get stronger position, not weaker position.]
;W[gd];B[ic];W[gb];B[id];W[ib];B[jb];W[he];B[ie];W[ge]TR[jc]
[jd]SQ[de][fe]C[--- After the exchange starting from G17, white has gotten much stronger and can break through your line into the center. The only gain for black was 2 stones that black capture. Also, the marked black stones are weakened severy. This is a big loss for black.]
;B[cc]
(;W[cd]LB[fc:A]C[--- Since black can cut white F17 group later on, white probably should play C18 and wait for opportunity to attack black later.]
;B[dd];W[ce];B[ec];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[fd]C[--- Good job separating white's group.]
;W[gg];B[hi]TR[de][fe][eh]C[--- Black's connections between marked stones are quite weak now. You should reinforce by playing at D13 first before this move.]

(;W[eg]
(;B[fg]C[--- You should wedge at D13 instead. See variation.]
;W[ff];B[dg];W[fh];B[ef];W[dh];B[fg];W[gr]C[My vital wrong. See the next variations.

--- If you really have no ko threat, it is still better to capture G14 than answer G3.

Black has a ko threat at S17. But white G2 is not that much of a threat. So, you should probably capture G14 now.]

(;B[gq];W[eg]
(;B[bc]LB[rc:A]C[--- A better ko threat would be at A.];W[df]
;B[bb];W[ed];B[da];W[ee];B[ca];W[dd];B[bd];W[be]C[--- Lossing big groups would be one of the most common reasons to lose a game quickly.

In this game, you lost two groups in the upper-left and upper-right corners. To improve your skills, you shoud practice tsumego (live-and-death problems). 

There are several books and web sites that provide them. I recommend "Graded Go Problem for Beginners" books. For 10k, you should try volume 2 & 3. You will be surprised how much you have improved after that!

Most of all, play a lot of games and have fun! That is the best way to improve your games.]

The marked white and black groups are quite weak. However, I think black has more potential due to their bigger framework.]

--- As stated earlier, black at P14 is absolutely vital.

Black can look forward to attacking top white group with R18 later.

Also white at H3 or C6/D6 would be better than C11. Black stone is approaching white corner. So, it is more urgent to play around that area.]

Black need save your group.

--- The bottom white group is quite scattered. Black can also come in at A to H.

Since the bottom is quite open at the beginning, you should be able to find a better way to play, such as H3 instead of O4. 

At the top, black can press at J16 and move out quite easily.

Overall, black is leading in this scenario.];B[id]C[--- Black puts pressure here.]
