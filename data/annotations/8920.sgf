C[Graytheory [13k\]: yo
colllo [13k\]: hi];B[pd]C[Hello, my name is Michael Reilly.  My rank is about 5 kyu.  I'll be reviewing your game.  I've marked all of your comments.  I'll also mark mine.]
(;W[cd]C[Michael: A 3-4 does not fully secure a corner.  A 3-3 does.  But that way of play is considered to be slow.  Moreover, if you want to play a 3-4 you should have played D17.  Because a play at E16 or E17 works very well with Black's 4-4 stone.

Graytheory: My plan this game involves agressive reduction, and connecting out with many small bases for control of the middle. I figured the plan would leave me with less overall territory, so I decided to fully secure this corner.]
;B[pp];W[qf]C[Michael:  It doesn't matter.  I will totally allow a double approach on a 4-4 to get the first move on an open corner.

Graytheory: Hoping that he will get greedy for that unused corner, and allow me into this one.]
(;B[nc]
(;W[rd]C[Michael: But playing this way is even worse for you.  Because you're playing a gote joseki, which means... (go to move 9)... What you really want to do it play a sente joseki.  Here's one possibility: (see variation)]
;B[qc];W[qi];B[dp]C[Michael: Black gets the first move in 3 corners. (back to move 6)]
;W[pn]LB[ec:B][ed:A]C[Michael: A much larger move would be around A or B.

Graytheory: High approach for better influence];B[np];W[qp]
C[Michael: Don't think of it in terms of who has the most corners.  Think of it in terms of balance of territory.  Right now the only real territory is under your 2 space extension and under black's panther shape near Q18.

Graytheory: cant let him have 3 corners.];B[qq]
(;W[rp]C[Michael: Just pull back for now.

Graytheory: just trying to keep the group strong for now.];B[rq]
C[You need to answer this.]
(;W[cq]C[This move is WAY too early.  Why are you invading the 3-3 already?  A 3-3 invasion should be sort of a last resort, in the very late beginning of the game.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm]
(;W[bm]C[Too far.];B[cl];W[ec]C[Michael: Well, I'm glad you got this move in, but you gave up a lot to do it.  Don't be too greedy, or you will collapse.

Graytheory: Seemed like the right time to enclose.];B[cr];W[br]
;B[dr];W[jp]C[Michael: It won't die, but it is very small.

As far as this move is concerned.  When playing an invasion you should look for forcing moves first.  You don't really have many that can be used effectively here though.  There's the move at E5, but it gets rid of aji and doesn't help you much.  As far as this invasion goes, the point looks good, but I probably would have played L3 instead, because you threaten to undercut black's group (sente or trade.) And you can still get out quickly.

One BIG thing you need to know about invasion is, invade too much and you give the game to your opponent.  Because the most important part of go is attack and defense, and that revolves around weak groups.  If you constantly invade, you are constantly giving your opponent a weak group to attack.

Graytheory: Now that I look at it, the bottom left may have died if he played right. Not sure, ill have to replay it a few games.

Following my plan with this move.

Setting up for some dramatic reductions. Playing high so I can connect out.]
;B[kq];W[jq];B[kp];W[fq];B[jo];W[kr];B[lr];W[ir]C[

Graytheory: Bad move maybe. need to keep this group alive though.]
;B[ks];W[jr];B[ko];W[io];B[in];W[hn]C[Too much.];B[ho];W[ip]
;B[go]C[Michael: Yes, you were being too greedy.

Graytheory: Should have read the double hane better. Did not turn out in my favor.]
(;W[fo]C[Michael: A better move for that would be E5, see variation.

Graytheory: attempting to escape, while also removing a liberty, while also trying to connect out.]
;B[fn];W[gm]C[Michael: You should always protect cutting stones and try to make them live, if feasible.

Graytheory: cant get out, so I try to make h6 usefull to me later in the game.]
;B[gn];W[hm];B[jn]
(;W[hq]C[Michael: Well, let's try, see variations... It looks like white's best bet would be a very heavy ko.  So you needed this move.

Graytheory: Got a little worried about life here. Couldnt read out if he attacked.]
;B[bl]
(;W[ap]C[Michael: I'm pretty sure that you're alive without this move, see variations.

Graytheory: Alive? yes. Pretty sure.];B[fp];W[eo]C[Michael: It does look bad.  It's very small, you have bigger things to worry about, like R4, like K17, like H7, like C11. Just to name a few. :)

Graytheory: I knew this looked bad at the moment, but I just had a feeling that I needed f5 later this game.]
;B[ep];W[en];B[em];W[cg]C[This could stand to be a few spaces further.  Your corner is secure, and if black invades then simply jumping up will work well with your H7 stones (if you're intending to sacrifice them, as this move suggests.)]
;B[kc];W[gd]C[Michael: You should do another low extention, or a shoulder hit.  This move isn't really an option.  It's awkward, and it doesn't really get you much.  As you can see.

Graytheory: eeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhh

I dont like this shape. But I didnt want to do another low extention.]
;B[qk]C[Michael: It actually doesn't hurt as much as you think it does.

Graytheory: This hurts. Really bad. I wish I had seen this before I played the last move.  Spent some time thinking here.

Cant push him tward r11, or I will get sealed in. Cant push him tward q6 or that group will be in trouble. I think after the fact, q9 would have been good.]
(;W[nn]C[Michael: Correct group, wrong idea.

Graytheory: Need this group out, fast.];B[ok]C[

Graytheory: Got what I wanted, dint push him tward my groups. Still doesnt look good.]
;W[ic]C[Michael: And you just had to commit suicide in order to make it. :D

Graytheory: Shape looks a little better now.];B[rj];W[ri];B[rn]
C[Michael: Ouch.  That really hurts.

Graytheory: This probably lost me the game. Should have connected these groups.]
;W[nk]C[Michael: It doesn't help you do any of that though.  I think you panicked.  All you're doing now is helping black.

Graytheory: this move should help me connect out with r11, or connect out with 06.]
;B[nj];W[mk];B[mj]
(;W[oj]C[Michael: I think you're too obsessed with killing things.

Graytheory: This cut will maybe help me kill r9. Kindof desperate though.]
;B[pj];W[oi];B[pi];W[ol];B[pk]C[Michael: Things are not quite as dire a you expect.  You have reasonably good eyeshape now for your group, you might be able to live small locally or run.

Graytheory: very bad for me.]
(;W[nh];B[ph];W[of]C[Michael: No.  You'll collapse and give black another weak group to attack.  Floating without a base.

Graytheory: gotta stick with my plan and hold the middle.];B[qh]
;W[rh]
(;B[oh];W[ni];B[qo];W[lj];B[kf];W[mi];B[rc];W[re];B[il]
(;W[gk]C[Michael: No, those stones are still light.  You can afford to sacrifice them.  Currently they are splitting J6 from H5.  Both of those groups are immortal, so those cutting stones don't matter at all.

Graytheory: need these stones. They MUST get out.];B[ek];W[cj]
C[Michael: Why?  Where is black's territory coming from? He's got a little at the top.  And a large corner.  You also have a large corner.  Don't be too jealous of your opponent's territory.  At your level, this is still anyone's game.

Graytheory: Looking at the game at thsis point, I need more points bad.]
;B[fj];W[hk];B[jj];W[hi];B[gh]C[By insisting on saving those stones, you're driving black right through your moyo.]

;W[mf];B[jb];W[ib];B[ia];W[ha];B[ja];W[jc]C[Michael: It only works because black's L17 stone can be ataried.  Always read out your moves, if you have time.  Clever move, I'll have to remember it.  Though I believe that black's way too early to be playing these moves.  He should be invading your corner.

[rr][sr][ds][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Michael: A very close game indeed.  You could have won it as recently as move 268.

My thoughts on your overall play.  You're very jealous of your opponent's territory, and that's a bad thing.  Go is a game of trades.  You trade this for that.  You need to allow black to have territory, so that you can also have territory.

You also seemed to panic quite a bit when your groups were in danger.  You need to learn to let stones go, especially when they don't seem to be serving a purpose.  Saving your three stones at H6 meant that Black drove his group right through your moyo, and if he were a stronger player, he would have broken into your territory in the top left corner.

I would suggest learning about Attack and Defense.  Especially Defense.  It's OK to Defend.  It's an honest way of playing.  Currently, you're spreading yourself so thin that if your opponent plays correctly, even if you get everything you want, you'll still lose.  By defending you secure what you have and you can attack without worrying about leaving weaknesses behind.

Hope this was informative.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Several big mistakes evened out the game, and I lost it at the end by not keeping sente.
