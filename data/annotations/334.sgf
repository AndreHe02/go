;W[qg]C[This gives black too much room in the corner, play at R14];B[qe]
;W[rf]C[TWO problems with this move 1) White cant make eyes on the side easily - this is
because of S8, black is below white and therefore can slide under white, ie the
monkey jump at T11.   2)At the moment black's corner is open, if White played at
R17, white could make a living group, once black plays S15, this becomes much harder.
In summary this move doesnt help white live, and DOES help black protect his corner.
A better move would be to jump out to P13];B[re];AW[oj]C[mm: Is this a good move?  Would an
invasion be better, say at N17 or
B13?  Or an extension in the lower
left corner to C8 or D8?
===
This group is still weak, and there is at least one proverb that advises against
having two weak groups on the board at once, so yes, defending this group is better
than an invasion. C8 or D8 is better than an invasion, but protecting your weak group
is more important. If you leave this group black can attack it, (say P13) and turn
the
top side of the board into territory. However, a better move to defend this group
would be P13, then black almost has to play around O15 and then you could play C8.]

(;W[cg]C[Usually when attacking a corner, you want to play at C14 or D14, it makes it easier
to run into the corner if you have to, it also gives you more room to live on the
side.];B[fd];W[eg];B[ce];W[bf];B[be];W[bj]C[mm: This was an accidental slip with
the mouse.  I meant to play at B11,
hoping to make eye space.  Which is
better-- B10, B11, or C11?  (Or  should i be playing in a different
part of the board?)
===
I wouldnt leave this group without making it stronger. Its hard to tell if B10 is
ok, it looks very complicated if Black plays B11, I'm not sure what happens. I think
playing on line 11 is better because it is safer. However I wouldnt play B11, I'd
play C11 - where possible you want to play towards the centre.];B[dh];W

(;W[bl]C[mm: Here, should i have tried to cut
instead, at D8?
===
Cutting at D8 seems to give a fight where you have the advantage. Black is split  into weak groups, both of which are surrounded on many sides by white. So yes,
you probably should have.];B[cm];W[bn]LB[gg:A]C[Its not a good idea to crawl along the second line, white has enough room along the
left side, the main priority now is dealing with black's top, jumping out to
G13(a), is probably more important, not only does it threaten black's top, it
also threatens black's left hand side];B[cn];W[cj]C[Still, G13 is more important, if you do want to make the LHS safer, it is better
to play at B12 than here, can you see why???]
(;B[hp]C[mm: At this point, black has the  whole top side, a very thick center-
facing wall on the left side, a
pretty stable group on the right,
and black is invading white's bottom
side.  What should white do?
===
I wouldnt really consider the black left hand group to be thick, it has NO eyes,
and can't easily make them. In this sort of case, you have to try to make profit
while attacking. If you can make it so black has two weak black groups, then even
better. Splitting as you did is the correct idea.];W[fn];B[em];W[hn];B[lp]
;W[lq];B[mq];W[mp]C[mm: I knew that playing N4 would
probably mean i'd lose the K3 stone,
but i was worried about the lower
right corner.  Would it have been
better for white to play N4 at L3  instead?  Then i might have been
able to kill the H4 stone; but i
think i'd have had to scramble more
in the corner... ?
===
This is fine, what you do want to try to do is keep this group seperate from the
right, and to try to develop thickness around lines 5&6. You may be able to attack
to the left or right later];B[kq];W[lr];B[kr];W[mr];B[jp];W[ip];B[iq];W

invade the top later on. ie this move sets you up for a double attack, either at
(a) or (b).];B[he];W[og]LB[gk:A][ml:B]C[Seeing as black defends the top, you should attack the left, playing at (a), or
thereabouts should almost definitly kill black, even if you dont kill black, you  can then attack around (b) and seal off the entire centre]

===
Here is better than at Q6, if you play at Q6 you will be closer to black's forces
and they will be able to more forcibly attack you.];B[om];W[nm];B[pn];W
[oo];B[pm];W[nl];B[ol];W[ok]C[mm: In retrospect, it looks like i
should have played R9 before playing  P9... ?

Yes, even if black does cut through here, white is so thick it doesnt really matter]
;B[qk];W[pk]MA[oj][ok][pk]LB[rj:A]C[This move makes an empty triangle(the marked stone), generally empty triangles
are frowned upon, mainly because all your stones are in a little clump, its not
very efficient, blocking along the edge, S10 (a) seems better];B[rj];W[ri]
C[mm: Thoughtless of me... R11 would have been better, i think.

Yes, whenever you start to get diagonals close up to your opponents moves, you
have to be careful];B[qi];W[qh];B[pj];W[pi];B[qj];W[rh];B[nf];W[ng];B[mf]
C[mm: This was very alarming-- black
making territory on the 6th line!
How should i have stopped him?
===
Its not that bad, its not in the opening of the game, if you think about it this
move is only about 6 points or so. If this was in the beginning of the game,
and your opponent was developing a line along the 6th line, then yes, it would
be very worrying.];W[lg];B[mh];W[mg];B[lh];W[kg];B[kh];W[ig];B[ij];W[jk]

i hoped to develop a threat that  would be useful for invading at P15.
What would be a better way to go?
===
Everythings fairly well set out now, playing like this means black gets very thick
around here whilst killing you, you probably can only nibble away here at the
edges. Moves like T15 are good, they are worth 4 points in double sente. ie you  can play them in sente, and so can your opponent, A15 is identical.]

[tt]C[white wins by 13.5

I would say the major mistake you made was not to capitalise on the weakness of  black's left hand side. Though that didnt turn out to bad because when you eventually
did attack it you managed to surround lots of territory in the centre. Perhaps the
best suggestion I could make is that you should look for groups on the board that
you can harrass(not neccesarily kill), and that by harrassing you can develop walls
to surround territory.   A second comment, which would help reduce the size of your opponents corners
is to play at the 6-3 point when attacking the opponent's 4-4 point.])
