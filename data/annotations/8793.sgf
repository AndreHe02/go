AB[pd][dp]C[Mark - This is my general comment of this game.

After viewing this game, i feel White needs to think more "big picture". Instead of trying to get a few points here and there, white needs to think about building frameworks and foundations that could possibly turn into 20-30 points, either through surrounding ot by capturing enemy stones. 

I would suggest a study in fuseki and attacking problems. Get stong at Fusekt and Get strong at attacking are good places to start.

I hope you find my comments throughout this game helpful!]PL[W]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[fq];B[cn];W[qf]TR[pf][fp]C[Mark - I feel this is too slow. Black started off with two 4-4 points, and you are staing on the third line. I would recommend playing at least one of your stones at the triangle points to counteract black's influence in the centre.]
;B[nq];W[kq];B[pn]
(;W[no]C[Mark - This is soft, fearful. As white, you must be brave to counteract black's handicap. 

See variation.];B[qq]C[Mark - Because of white's timidity, the corner is now lost.]

(;W[hb]C[Mark - Another fearful move. This says to me "I want to make eyes now!"

White is not in big danger yet and can afford to be aggressive.

See variation.];B[ib];W[lc];B[kd]C[What are the ways to deal with this situation?
I feel that I have to try to cut the black stones, but don't see the good way to do it. In general, I thing there should be possiblity to make life for black more complicated.

Maybe it's better to play outside of the potential black teritory? For exmaple S17

Mark - It's still too soon to think about moves like S17. M17 is interesting, but the following move at K16 only strengthened black.

See variation.]
(;W[jd];B[kc];W[me];B[ld];W[md];B[mc];W[nc];B[lb]TR[jd]C[Mark - Because of the triangle stone, the variation suggested earlier no longer works.]
;W[od];B[ne];W[oe];B[nf];W[pc];B[mf]TR[pb]C[Mark - Even after this the corner is not safe. Black can play the triangle point and make things complicated.]
(;W[ck]C[Mark - Not the best. See variation.];B[ci];W[le];B[kf]
(;W[dr]C[Mark - This feels too early. See variation.];B[cq]
(;W[fg]C[Mark - There is not much territory here, so this move has little meaning. See variation.]

(;W[pi]C[Mark - White is stronger here. Be daring!

(;W[rn]C[How to attack the black more effectively?

The black possition is quite open and there maybe I feel a more smart way to get some benefits for white.

Mark - See variation];B[rm];W[qn];B[rk];W[pm];B[qm]C[At this point white should choose the right direction I believe. The result of the actual game doesn't seem good enoght.]
