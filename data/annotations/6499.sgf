C[I hope this review helps you.

I think you should read this and try it out for your next 10 games.

;W[qd];B[cp];W[dc];B[ep]CR[jq]C[> perhaps C6 is better, to aim at extending to K3?
E4 aims at extending on the left side. Something like C10. However, C6 is to far up to fully support a move on the third row like K3.]
;W[cj];B[qj]CR[jq]C[> K3 better?
No. If white invades at K3 black will attack that stone and strengthen his stones on line 4. R10 is good.]
;W[qn];B[mq];W[po];B[qp];W[pl];B[oj]CR[nj]TR[mj]C[> Is the two point jump here to timid - better to jump to marked places?  If  I should jump to the triangle - how would I answer white at P10.
No. Its not to timid. If you jump to O or N white have the option of cutting R10 off and you will be stuck with two week groups to defend.]

(;W[nl];B[oc];W[qf];B[ce];W[fc]C[F3 is a bit timid I think, and could be squeezed more closely than K17 by black (?)]
;B[jc];W[od];B[pc]C[> perhaps I should have played Q16 here?
No. P17 needs support.];W[qc];B[qb];W[rb];B[qa]C[R19, being an edge move is probably too passive at such an early stage?
> Yes. R18 could have been used elsewhere. Like, C12, N10. The R10 group is a bit too week.]
;W[ra]
(;B[pd]C[> P18 to protect the cut Q18 better?
If one wants to protect R19 and R18 yes. I'm not so sure it's worth it though. See variation.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[pb]
(;B[oa]C[This is a bad move. Protect P17 with the move P18 instead. If white plays Q19 you play O16. See variation.]
;W[ob]
(;B[nd]C[> O17 better?
Yes, see variation.];W[nc];B[od];W[mc];B[nb];W[pa];B[mb];W[of]
;B[md]
(;W[na]C[White should have played M17 here. See variations.]
;B[lc];W[hd];B[je];W[ll];B[ej]TR[mq][oj][pp][qj][qp]C[> looking at the end of the game, the marked stones die (as part of large groups).  Perhaps I should have answered M8 more directly at M10 (for example)? Or K8

M10, is probably too far away. N10 is better. E10 invites whites next move. C15 needs a base. Instead of E10 play C12.]
;W[ch]C[Now C15 is in trouble.];B[eg];W[cf];B[de];W[be];B[ed]
;W[ec]C[While black struggles to connect all his stones. White makes terrotory along the edges.]
;B[df];W[cg]
(;B[cl]C[Is black trying to connect his E10 group with his E4 group here or is he trying to make terrotory between C4 and C8? He will not get both. See variations.]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[ek]
(;B[fk];W[el];B[dn];W[fl];B[cn];W[hl];B[gl]C[> this is probably a very bad move ?

A cut is used to split up groups so that they become week. Here both sides of the cut are strong so the cut makes on sense. On top of that white can play G9 and the cut will fail anyway.]
;W[gm];B[gk];W[gp];B[go]C[> thinking about what happened in the long run of this game, perhaps I should have connected underneath G4 at G3 too keep my stones in the corner connected?

G3 is better since it makes terretory along the edge. A better way to strenghten the lower rigth corner group (instead of connecting) is to extend it with a move like L3.]
;W[iq];B[hp];W[hq];B[gq];W[fq];B[fp];W[gr];B[eq];W[fr];B[er]
;W[kq];B[jl]C[> I didn't like "white's two-jump wall" here but this black stone looks lonely! ?  perhaps it would be better to extend from my corner at M4 or near?

Playing a stone close to your oponents strong possitions is often bad. If your stone survives it's still weak and your oponent can use this too strengthen his possition even more. While he attacks your stone he will build up an even bigger wall.]
;W[lp];B[np]C[> there's a lot of subtle moves now, which I think I played slightly wrongly which allowed white to connect too easily.  I think this is the first mistake - should have been played at O5?

I think this move is ok. To stop white from connecting you shold have playd M4 instead of K8. Even then it's questionable. If you cut white you will force him to attack your P10 group which is something you don't want.]
;W[no];B[oo];W[on];B[op];W[mo];B[in]C[J7 instead. That will force white H7 and then you can place black J6.]
;W[hn];B[io];W[im]C[> allowing white the ponnuki shape is probably a bad idea.... ?

It's pretty surrounded so it no biggie.];B[jm];W[mg];B[kn]C[> i felt L6 was necessary to give me an eye shape, avoid getting crushed

It's not. It protects against a cut though (white k6). However, this cut is not so bad. Responding to white N13 is a better move. Your P10 group is in big trouble now.]
;W[ho];B[ip];W[kj]
(;B[kk]C[> I think this is weak move - perhaps N11 to try to avoid black stones P10 and R10 being cutoff is better?

The stones are pretty much already cut of. I would have gone for black Q13 insted. See variations.]
;W[lk];B[lj];W[li];B[mj];W[ki];B[gn];W[hm]
(;B[gp]C[> i filled here to avoid the Ko followed by the cut- apparently I'm not at all concerned the stones on the RHS have no eyes

You can connect the stones the other way too. See variation.]
;W[fn];B[em];W[fm];B[eo]C[This move is too smal. Save it for the endgame.]
;W[en];B[dm];W[rh]C[Your black group is in so much trouble now that you should be very happy if it survives.]
;B[nk]C[> i think this kind of move and white's response is what lost me the game?

I think not protecting your black group in time lost you the game.]
;W[ni];B[ol];W[om];B[ok];W[ml];B[mi];W[mh];B[nh];W[oi];B[ph]
;W[oh];B[qk]C[i'm thinking about eyes too late];W[rl];B[ql]
;W[qm];B[sl]C[> this looks like a strong move, but white's respone puts me in my place.  Could I play this if S12 was black?

Yes.. you could. But it would not give you eyes so it's still not good.]
;W[sm];B[sk];W[rk];B[pk];W[pm];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp];W[so];B[pn]
C[stupid mistake - should have played T4?

T4 would have been better but still pretty small. There are bigger moves to play. H15 maybe.]
;W[sp];B[sq]C[> another stupid mistake!

Yes, this is very bad.];W[rq];B[rj]C[That group is dead now. You should have gone for R3 instead.]
;W[sj];B[si];W[ri];B[sk];W[sh];B[sj];W[qq]C[Now you gave white a chance to make it even worse.]
;B[rr]C[From the other side. T3 is dead so therefore R3 is alive and you have to protect from the other side.]

C[> i can't remember why I didn't take the ko - this isn't good play from me

;B[ps];W[mr];B[lr];W[lq];B[ls];W[kr];B[sl];W[rm];B[fs]C[edge move here is probably premature?

Yes.];W[hs];B[es]C[Save moves likes this for the end of the endgame.]
;W[if];B[jg]C[What is this move good for? Here you need a move that strengthens your F9-E10-E13-D14 group. Something like H12.]
;W[fj];B[hj];W[fi]
(;B[fh]C[> i think this is a weak attack - perhaps there is a better move, around H13?

E11 is better. See variations.];W[ei];B[hc];W[gc];B[gd]C[> simple move J17 necessary first?
