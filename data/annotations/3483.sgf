C[U: Hello! Thanks for reviewing my game

This was my first game against a human, I had a few against gnugo.

I made many  big mistakes, most notably at turn 70, 160, 164. I believe those cost me a large group, and thus the game

AC: Hi, I haven't been playing much the past six months so I will try to keep mainly to general points in this review.  I hope it's of some help.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[cc];W[dp]C[AC: openings where each player takes diagonally opposite corners tend to lead to games where there is a lot of fighting.  If you prefer to avoid this, then making your first move in top left would have made sense.]
;B[lq];W[qn]CR[jd][dj][pj]C[AC: I'm not wild about this move.  Black's extension to M3 is too narrow - K3 or K4 would be standard - and still a bit loose: there could be the chance to invade later.  R6 gives him a chance to patch up, maybe with R4 or S4, or to kick your stone with R5.

It's better, I think, to hold off fighting and make an extension from one of your 4-4 stones.  If black continues to make narrow extensions while you make wider, more efficient ones you'll certainly head into the middle game with an advantage.  There's no hurry to move in bottom right - even he extends up the right side with his next move, the 3-3 invasion will still be available.

Another option is to play D16, pressing his 3-3 stone down and building influence.]
;B[qc]LB[qk:A][rp:B]C[AC: Not the obvious move - I would have expected a pincer such as Q10.  

You don't have to respond to this invasion immediately - your corner is lost but even if black makes another move in this area your 4-4 stone can keep him contained. 

I would almost be inclined to play R9 to give R6 a base, and continue to threaten his corner.]

(;W[qd]C[AC: but if you are going to respond, this is the correct side to block on.]
;B[pc]
(;W[od]LB[oc:B][od:A]C[U: I should probably have gone to P17 here

AC: correct.];B[oc];W[pi]C[AC: this is premature - you should be trying to seal black into the top right corner.  Now black has the opportunity to bend around your wall with O16.  O17 or even N16 are better for you, I think.]
;B[qi];W[qj]C[AC: you show good instinct in pushing him towards your wall.  However invasions like this are extremely difficult to kill and sometimes containment is the only option.]
;B[qh];W[ph];B[rj]LB[qg:A][qk:B]C[AC: Here I think you're better off playing R9 to prevent him from separating your stones.  You're giving up small territory along the right side in exchange for a big wall which should reap benefits later.]

(;W[qg];B[qk];W[pj];B[pk]C[AC: This is exactly what you wanted to avoid - the R6 stone is looking very weak.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[qp]C[AC: you play well to get out of trouble - in a situation like this contact moves are often the best form of defense and you should always be ready to sacrifice one or two stones to save the rest.]

(;W[cj]C[U: Perhaps P9 , to prevent black from fleeing to the middle, and to make sure that he dies?

AC: Personally I might go K3 to pressure black's M3 stone.  If black tries to run out you should be able to cut off the R9 stones' escape route.]

C[AC: this is the move you did not have to make - play Q13 now and the situation is salvageable.]
;B[pg];W[og];B[pf]
(;W[qm]C[This is my first big mistake: I should have connected at P12

AC: connecting at P12 is a must but even so things will be messy.]

;B[ce]
(;W[cg]C[AC: why not C14?];B[bf];W[gd];B[dd];W[ee];B[ed];W[fd]
;B[hc];W[cf];B[cd]C[AC: this sequence works out well for you - again black takes territory and gives you the makings of a big moyo.]
;W[fq]C[U: G3 would have been better, I think

AC: two choices here - securing the corner with D3 is probably the better of them.  If you're going to play along the side, it's imperative to make sure that the M3 stone has no room to make a base in which case you need to play H3, J3 or even K3.  I don't think G3 serves either purpose well.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[bp];W[bo];B[ap]C[AC: this looks like a mistake by black but I can't figure the sequence to kill the invasion from here so maybe I'm wrong.]
;W[ao];B[bq];W[cn];B[er];W[fr];B[es];W[fs];B[dr];W[jq];B[lk]
;W[ll];B[kj];W[im]C[U: Here I try to define my territory

AC: At this point your prospects are pretty good to win this game provided some of your stones in the top right live.  Making life in the corner will be difficult if not impossible so you need to keep the escape route open.  

When you start defining your territory like this you have to be wary of the fact that it's simultaneously cutting off the escape route into the middle of the board for your stones in top right and it might have been better to secure them before claiming territory.]
;B[ij];W[hk];B[bg];W[bh]C[AC: Play C12 instead - if Black continues to push you play B11 and it doesn't leave a cutting point.  Two stones in a line are vulnerable to the kind of cut that comes next - three stones in a line is much more secure.]
;B[ch];W[dh];B[df]LB[ef:A][dg:C][ci:B];W[ef]C[U: In the game, I thought I would let him take the two stones to prevent him from going in the middle. He went there anyway. Perhaps it was a mistake to sacrifice the stones?

AC: well, you definitely can't contain him there - there are too many cutting points.  I'd be inclined to try either of the other options - C11 at least keeps you strong on one side.  It's going to be a scramble to keep your stones alive on the top though.]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[eh];W[di];B[fh]C[AC: I always think of situations like this as being like hammering jelly.  No matter where you play it seems like your opponent can just slide off in another direction.  When you're trying to contain, you have to play a little off - direct contact moves just won't work.

Notice too that the E15 stones are looking pretty weak now - you can get one eye by playing G14  but there's no obvious source for the second one.  The ideal situation for black now is to force these weak stones towards the other weak stones in top right - once they are close enough together he can play stones that attack both simultaneously, which often means one or both will die.]

AC: Yes - you live in the centre and can concentrate on taking as much territory as possible in the lower left.]

(;W[nd];B[me];W[nc];B[of]
(;W[ob]C[U: This was stupid. I should have cut at N17.  I continued ignoring the cut for the rest of the sequence which lost me the group

AC: It's worth a shot - I think if you cut you can probably kill either the corner or the J18 stones.]

(;W[nm]LB[jm:B][nm:A]C[U: Was there a better way to defend? Perhaps the variation?

    However, I was happy with my first game. It was quite intense, and I believe that if the upper group had managed to live, I would have won.
    Do you have any suggestions as to what I should focus on?
    Thanks again.

AC: You certainly had opportunities in this game and you might well have won had you saved that upper group.  

There are a few basic things I would consider:

Keep your stones connected - when your stones are divided, it's easy to get tied down into defending this group and then that.

You never want to have more than one weak group on the board - if you already have a weak group on the board you must give it a base (the potential to make two eyes) before you create another group.  As the game goes on, groups that were reasonably safe can weaken - reinforce them before it becomes a major problem.

In attacking your goal is not always to kill - the game is won by capturing territory, not pieces.  It's generally easier and less risky to seal your opponent in than to kill his group.

Paradoxically in Go, contact moves are played primarily for defense and in attacking, you should back off a little and make sure your opponent can't break through your line.  Playing a lot of contact moves will leave you with a lot of cutting points for your opponent to exploit.

Otherwise, just keep playing -you did fine for your first game against a human opponent.]
