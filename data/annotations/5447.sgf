AB[dd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][pp]C[Mark: This is one of my first games with a high handicap against a single kyu player.  I lose the game fairly quickly (about move 106) but keep playing for some experience.  I don't have a good sense of how to use the stones I have to keep any advantage I may possess.

TIM:
Hi, first I looked at the first 100 moves, so let's see now, move by move.
I will not say that my suggestions are the best moves, it they were, i'd play this game for living;-)
But hopefully you can learn from it!]PL[W];W[nc]
(;B[pc]C[Mark: Possibly small move, but I want to protect the corner.

TIM

When you start this game, you have 6 stones that will help you! try to use there influence. 
By making this move, you just want to protect what you have.. 10-15 points in the corner. No fighting spirit, easy start for white.]
;W[ic];B[fc]C[Mark: So I try to reduce White's territory.];W[qf]
;B[re]C[TIM

again you want only your corner. White can seal you in if he wants, and then he get's a lot of influence]

(;W[qh]C[TIM
w tries to make a base... but this is too small];B[qj]C[TIM

I can't say this is bad, but it is small. In my opinion it doesn't  put pressure on white.
(this is called iron pillar)];W[mp]C[TIM

A strange approach, white is scared of a pincer i believe:-)]

(;B[qn]LB[pm:A]C[Mark: Hmm, with the wall I wonder if A is better.

TIM

Well like this, again you don't put any pressure on white. Don't be so absessed by protecting your corners!
Here black is too thick. All your stones concentrated on the right side.]

i wouldn't call it bad, but if you continue like that, your corners will die :(]

Will be cut!];W[fn]C[Mark: I really this this is trouble now --- my group might have some territory, but not much.  I'm not making this group work with the stone at K10.

good cut from white...];B[fm];W[gn];B[go];W[gm];B[fl];W[cr]

(;B[hl]C[Mark: I'm just trying forcing moves to try and create some space for me.

Tim

these forcing moves make white strong enough
Or they allow him to enter your possible territory];W[gk]
(;B[fk]C[Mark: But now I have to protect the group on the left.

Tim:

no you don't, you can still run towards the upper side of the board]
;W[fj]
(;B[ek];W[hk];B[io];W[hp];B[ip];W[jk];B[jn]C[Mark: Trying to create eyespace.

Tim

this doesn't create eyespace, it prevents a cut];W[kj];B[ji]
;W[kl];B[lk]LB[hq:A]C[Mark: Again, I'm trying forcing moves.  Looking at it now, I think A is much better (or at least it gives me a better chance to get an eye on the bottom.

Tim
If you want eyespace, h3 is better... But try to put pressure on the n4 stone, that became really lonely]

Mark: I have some territory on the right and very little on the top.  I think the group in the lower right is dead as well (although Score Estimator disagrees).


Tim
If you don't know if it's dead, play it out! that is the only advice i can give to you.

You should be careful not to get cut too often. Play big moves first (but what are they , isn't it?) be careful about life and death problems. 
Try to make it hard for your opponent! try to make him suffer for every point he gets! ;-)
You make it too easy because you play too defensive! so that he gets a base, or living group to start with!

And if you lose because of agressive play, you'll learn more than defensive playing, i believe.

If you have more questions, just ask!!!

I'm very sorry for the 'move-mistakes' i made, I don't know how to undo them :-)

Hopefully you'll learn something from it. But as i said, if there is something you want to know more of, you can always ask me.

enjoy the rest of your games!!!
