C[hi, thanks for the review. I was unsure why I lost as I thought i played effectively. Would love any tips or suggestions on what area to study. thank you.

Derpi : Hi! I'm Derpi, and I'll be reviewing your game today! If you have any further questions I'm usually on OGS as "Derpi's Puzzles". Comments by me will have my name in front.]
;B[pd];W[co];B[pp];W[ec]C[Derpi: Your opponent chose very rare joseki to play! I'm guessing that you don't know much, if any, of this joseki, so it must have been harder for you. The other player must've had at least a small idea of where to play. But because both of you aren't that highly ranked yet, these moves should be avoided.]
;B[pj];W[di]C[Derpi: AKANE is seriously going crazy with this! In my opinion, the stones are a bit high, and invades are very possible.]
;B[ep]C[Derpi: This is good joseki.];W[jp]
(;B[hp]C[Derpi: A bit small? White made a mistake by playing too high, so Black can really mess with White. See possible moves. It would have been better if White had followed joseki (which even I had to search up :P) or had played one space lower.]
;W[nq];B[qn]C[A bit too dismissive, because White's is very weak, attacking would be better. Remember that as Black, you start with sente, so losing it this early would not be good!]
;W[pr]
(;B[qq]C[Too dismissive once again..., Black can easily stir up trouble, and a possible invade! See variations.]
;W[jd];B[lp]C[I'm not great at invasions and wasn't sure what I should do here.

Derpi: This isn't an invasion, it's a reduction, which should only be played when White is strong! See variations.]
;W[lq]
(;B[mp];W[mq]C[Derpi: Playing here only makes White stronger, while making your two stones weaker. See variations.]
;B[kp];W[kq]
(;B[op]C[Derpi: This move was a little bit slow, because it doesn't gain much territory and only protects.]
;W[oq];B[jo];W[np];B[no];W[iq];B[ip];W[jq];B[kn];W[hq];B[gq]
C[Derpi: White is getting a lot of territory on the bottom, but you do have a very nice moyo.]
;W[qr]
(;B[rr]C[Derpi: It's a mistake to respond to every move your opponent plays. There are much bigger moves in this situation. See variations.]
;W[pg]
(;B[of]C[Derpi: This allows White to live too easily! Attempting to kill White right here would be a mistake, because White gets more territory while reducing yours! use the moyo you build to your advantage.]
;W[pf];B[pe]C[Derpi: Black is left with a pretty bad cut. See other possible and more safe move.]

(;W[og];B[nf];W[ng];B[nd]C[overly defensive?

Derpi: Yup, I'm sure that the only reason this game was lost is because you gave White too many moves in gote. Even if White cuts, you can easily catch the stone in a ladder.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[ri];B[lj];W[lg]
(;B[mf];W[mg];B[gd]C[If you aren't sure what move to play, I don't blame you, but when your opponent plays a joseki that you don't know how to respond to, ask yourself these questions.

1. Is the opponents stones holding any territory? Like solid territory?

2. Is the move I want to play able to make life easily?

3. Should I reduce or invade?

4. If I were White, where would I respond?

Derpi: Because of how spread apart White's stones are. This "reduction" play only strengthens White.]
;W[cd];B[gf];W[lf];B[le];W[jf];B[gh]C[Here, you allowed Black to get too weak.]

;B[mc];W[rk];B[rj];W[sj]
(;B[qk];W[rl];B[ql]C[Derpi: Because Black is always one move behind, it's very bad to push like this! See variations.]
;W[rm];B[rn];W[qm];B[pm];W[si]
(;B[ee]C[Derpi: This move doesn't really accomplish much. white really doesn't even need to respond to this move, and can just play elsewhere. See variations.]
;W[cf];B[dd];W[dc];B[ce];W[be];B[de];W[bc]
(;B[df]C[Is this too heavy of a shape?

Derpi: Note way to heavy, but this is another pushing move you never want to play. See variations.]

Derpi: NICELY PLAYED!!

Sorry I had to use caps to give you my full happiness. So, places to improve on? Not joseki for sure XD. You will rarely have opponents that play crazy moves like that. Second, be sure to figure out when White's stones are strong and when they are weak. Don't reduce and end up strengthening White's stones! Also, be sure to know the value of moves. Sure, if you ignore, White gets a nice move in or a nice move there, but is it really worth grabbing another star point? Losing sente in this game was very harsh for your game. Also, be sure to see all the possible moves and what they are worth in the endgame. When White plays a move that doesn't threaten anything, it's usually better because you gain sente and can find another move to play elsewhere. You have a lot of improvement space but I feel that you would have won if you tweaked maybe one or two moves. 

Also, remember when White invaded in the middlish area? Don't be scared to net the stone. White overplayed irrationally by playing inside your "territory". Punish them by netting, not attatching, because white can hane when you attach.

Either way, it was a good and interesting game that I am very happy to see. If you want some further tips, be sure to hit me up on OGS :)]
