C[Review is done for the black side.
It is a close game, with many interesting ideas in it. 
I added some variations to illustrate some alternatives to the actual game.
(These alternatives are not necessarily better than the played moves.)
The players showed good positional judgement.
So it was a pleasure to review the game...

Enjoy.];B[pd];W[cp];B[ep];W[gq]C[A: Bad move from white? Was tenuki alright for black?
prana: Usually, you play this pincer if you have a w stone in the lower right corner. But, IMHO there is nothing wrong with playing like this. 
B can treat the e4 stone lightly, so tenuki is possible, I think.]
;B[pq]C[A: Would the upper left corner match e4 better?
prana: THe question is too difficult for me. Sorry.];W[dd];B[fo]

LB[cf:A][pk:B]TR[co][fo][dp][ep]C[A: Joseki apparently is c7. Is the difference big?
prana: The b group feels a bit heavy. 
An alternative idea is to treat the 4 marked stones lightly and tenuki. Still, there are huge alternative moves like A or B ...]
;W[ci];B[jd];W[qo];B[op];W[qk];B[qi]C[A: Is this move allright?
prana: Yes, good move. Keeps pressure on w.];W[oo];B[no]C[prana: if you intend to attack the w base, then R4 immediately might also be an idea.]
;W[on];B[mp];W[qc]C[prana: good timing!];B[qp]C[A: Could white have ignored here? (I guess r16 would have been all right for him)
prana: I agree, w R16 looks better. It would be hard for B to attak the lower w group.]

(;W[ro];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[nc]
(;W[ob]LB[mc:A]C[prana: too small. Better A.];B[oj]C[A: Even game here? (I felt slightly better)
prana: Hard to say. Maybe b has a small advantage, yes.];W[ok]
;B[nj];W[le]C[prana: clever move.];B[nk];W[ol]
(;B[jf]C[A: Good move?
prana: It looks natural, but the w stone is light, it is hard to attack him. So, switching the theme and cut immediately the connection to the upper group might be possible too.]

(;W[lg]C[prana: this is not good, I think. Connecting to the upper group would have been easier.]
;B[mf];W[lf]
(;B[jh]C[prana: this is also a  mistake, I think. B should not allow w to connect easily. Better keep w running...]
;W[lc]
(;B[kc];W[mc];B[fc]C[A: Bad result for black? Should I have kept him on the run for longer?
prana: yes, definitely. The b moyo on the right side has disappeared. The extension of F17 to the black wall is too close. W is happy now.]
;W[df];B[ei];W[ck];B[dh]C[prana: B is getting heavy now...]
;W[ch];B[dg];W[cg];B[ef];W[ee]C[A: this sequence probably wasnt that good, was it?
prana: Usually, it is the wrong direction to play away from your own thickness. Better try to use your thickness for fighting. W gains secure territorry, so he is fine.]
;B[cf]C[A: too early, I guess
prana: it is sente, so it doesn't harm.];W[de];B[db]
(;W[cc]C[prana: too easy going, w could have played more severe.]
;B[ff]C[A: Somehow it looks allright for black now. I guess white was too passive?
prana: Yes, w could have played more active and tenuki after d18.]

prana: I don't see an easy win. The w group is very weak, but it is not dead yet. And, if b wants to avoid a fight and defends his moyo, then it will be a close game, also.]
