AB[pd][dp][pp]C[The game with your girlfriend?
That's really funny.

I am a Chinese play, and 4-dan level.

I am very interesting how you let your girlfriend like this game.

OK, let's begin];W[dd];B[dj];W[nq];B[kq];W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[Wrong direction!];W[pq];B[op];W[mq]C[Tro:O2 would be normal (?), but since this is a handicap game I thought this might be ok...]
;B[hp]LB[qk:A]C[normal, B10 should be put on "A"];W[nc]LB[qj:A]
C[Tro: Is this the right direction?

Because this is the 3-handicaps game, 11 could not be thought as a bad one. But "A" place is better.]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]
(;B[qe]C[Tro: Black should go for Q15, since white has O17 in place.

Yes, B16 is a seldom play.  But the variation is very complex]

(;W[pe]LB[qb:A]C[W17 is not good,  "A" is a key place]
(;B[oe]C[wrong play];W[pf];B[od];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nb];W[ph]
;B[qk];W[iq]LB[ch:A][hc:B]C[Tro: I can not explain this... I had some wild ideas about geting L3 or the corner like this.


At current, this place is not very big. 
"A" or "B" is better];B[ip];W[hq];B[gq];W[gr];B[fq];W[fr];B[eq]
LB[jq:A]C[B34 should be put "A"];W[jq];B[jp];W[kr];B[kp];W[lq]
C[Tro: Well, it lives. Black got an impressive wall.];B[rh]
;W[qg]C[Tro: I think this keeps R15 cut.


YES];B[ok];W[cq]C[Tro: Timing?];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[br];B[cn]
;W[er];B[dq]C[this move is not necessary. It's kozai];W[dr]
;B[le]LB[cf:A][fc:B][mo:C]C[Tro: Too small for black.

from this move, I can know Black player is a very very beginner. "A" or "B" corner approach is good choice. Or "C" place connect all the black together.]
;W[mn]C[Tro: I try to control Q7 area and gain some contact for reducing the black walls influence. Is this ok?


W53 is not bad, but your thinking of controlling Q7 is terrible. The teritory around Q7 is not so big. You should place the stone on vital point.]

(;B[oq];W[or];B[no];W[mo];B[nn]LB[nm:A][fc:B][cf:C]C[bad move. I have told that the teritory around Q7 is not so big. "C" or "B" is much big than this place. If you really want to put stone on this, "A" is better choice.]
;W[in]LB[fk:A]C[Tro: I hope to either run to the middle, or connect to N6.

your thinking is not bad, but the place is not good. This place is dangerous, Black can cut you very easy.  If you put the stone around "A", you will find it more efficiency.]
;B[gn]C[Tro: Is this ok for black, or should she attack more directly?

This move is too small.];W[cj]LB[ch:A]C[Tro: Is this reasonable? Overplay?

normally, this play is bad one. because here is Black's territory.  "A" is good point.
But now your opponent is so weak and Black still have lead the game. Maybe you can have a try.]
;B[ci];W[ck];B[di];W[dk];B[cf]LB[fk:A]C[if B66 put on "A" place, I think white stones hard to make two eyes here.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[de];W[cd];B[df];W[fl]C[Tro: I try to connect the C9 triangle.]
;B[em];W[ej];B[fe];W[fc];B[ic];W[hd]LB[gc:A]C[Tro: Is this safe, or again overplay?

If Black player is a little strong, she will attach at "A".]

(;B[ei];W[fm]LB[fj:A][el:B]C[Tro: Defends E9 cut in sente.

you should play at "A". W81 is not sente if B play at "B" immediately.]
;B[fn];W[ol]C[Tro: This and my next move are missread. I thought that after I cross-cut I have two ways to atari black.]
;B[nl];W[nk];B[om]C[Tro: Clearly does not work...];W[ml]C[Tro: so I take what I can, some influence in sente. I made black a lot stronger in this area for no compensation.]
;B[pl];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[ld];W[kc];B[kb];W[id];B[ek]C[Tro: Can black make this cut work?

If B96 play at E8, I think that will better.];W[el];B[fj];W[dm]
;B[en];W[il]C[Tro: I think black can go for H8 to keep white running. This will remain open for a long time. I keep thinking, that I do not have tme for securing the connection. Also running is not totally hopeless.

If the white dragon will connect, black will lose the game.]
;B[kn];W[km]C[Tro: Safe or not?

No need to worry here. there are enough space for white to survial.]
;B[mk];W[ib]C[Tro: I want to connect H16 and F17. I thought this might give me something at M18 also.

that's a slip here ,H17 is enough.];B[jb];W[hc]C[now you will find, if you play 105 at H17, next move you will put the stone on H18 instead of J18.]
;B[lb]C[Tro: Not needed.

I don't know why black put the stone here.];W[fg]LB[rp:A][bf:B]
[rg:C]C[Tro: I want to control C13 area and get influence for the center.

wrong thinging like you want to control the Q7 area. 

Here I can find you and your opponent, your ability of endgame is so bad. 

There are so many big place here. all A, B, C are more bigger than W109]
;B[eg];W[ff];B[ef];W[nj];B[mm];W[lm];B[ll];W[jn]C[Tro: Securing M6 connection.]
;B[cm]C[Tro: Takes away whites eyepotential.];W[rg];B[qi];W[ko]
C[too small, only two points value.];B[rq]C[Tro: A big point. I was not happy to see black take it.

Yes, this one is very big. the value is more than 10 points.]
;W[rr];B[rp];W[pj];B[qj];W[pi];B[of];W[fh];B[fi];W[ge];B[ed]
;W[ec];B[lg];W[jg]C[Tro: I try to get some points around H14.

small. I have to tell you, the value of corner or side is much bigger than center.]

;B[oj];W[oi];B[mj];W[ni];B[pk]C[Tro: Small.

gote one point];W[bl]C[Tro: I want to get eyes, or if that fails then connect around H7. Running with D9 group is not a good option anymore...]
;B[cl];W[dl];B[bm];W[bi];B[bh];W[bj];B[bf];W[ak];B[ai];W[hm]
C[Tro: So I connect.];B[fk];W[ho]C[Tro: A few points in sente, and I am thinking if the whole black group can be reduced to one eye.... Not much chance...]
;B[go];W[kf];B[sg]C[Tro: Black starts to use her sentes...]
;W[sf];B[sh];W[re];B[ad];W[ac];B[ae];W[bc];B[sr];W[rs];B[ke]
;W[je];B[kg];W[lh]C[Tro: I want to make sure that black gets no points in the middle.]

;W[hf];B[sq];W[pr]C[Tro: Game over, white wins by 12.5 points. (0.5 komi)


Ok, my comment is over. if you have any problem, you can sent the email to me.]
