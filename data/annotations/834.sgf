AN[Comments by Arno Hollosi (dada), Austrian 1kyu]

C[aheimlich: hello reviewer. xinjia and i spent nearly an entire day on this game; i studied for 2 hours to prepare and he was well warmed up.  the game lasted almost five hours.  this is probably the best i am currently able to play go.  i've attempted to detail what i was thinking about while playing and make comments on the game the best i could. if my rank is noted by a comment, those are "say" messages recorded with the game.  i appreciate your time to review my game and hope you enjoy going over it as much as i enjoyed playing it.   good luck and best wishes, aheimlich :-)

 aheimlich 18k*: where was that magical opening move?

dada: I'm Austrian 1k (about IGS 3k-4k) - take my comments with a grain of salt ;o)]
;B[pd];W[cn]C[
 xinjia 17k*: Do I sense fear or laughter?
 aheimlich 18k*: :)

dada: unusual :o)];B[op];W[fc]C[
 aheimlich 18k*: anticipation
 aheimlich 18k*: i am trying to guess where black will move next :)
 xinjia 17k*: If you move q10 I will be happy];B[cd];W[cc]
(;B[dd]LB[dc:A]C[dada: this is not good enough.
Black has to play at A (d17) - see variation.];W[dc]C[dada: the result is not good for B - W has a rock solid corner.]

(;B[cj]C[dada: No way!! B has to play at A (e16) - urgent move!
See variations.
Furthermore this is overextended, if W invades B is in trouble.]
;W[jq]LB[ed:A]C[dada: this has to be at A (e16) - A remains the most urgent move on the board for a long time.]

(;B[dq]C[aheimlich: when i played this move, i assumed that i could use its influence to gain a lead on the rest of the board, and only plan to extend from it or attempt to make it live in response to a move to reduce it's influence. I'm not sure if that was a good idea in such a big area, but white looks very small to me at this point in the game.

dada: you are looking for trouble, aren't you?
See variation. B can live here, locally this is no problem. But if you consider the rest of the board it's suicidal.]
;W[cq]C[dada: I'm not sure that this is good. Never attach to stones you want to attack!]

(;B[ep]C[dada: strange move - should be at A (c4)
See variation.];W[cp]TR[dq][ep]C[dada: ouch! W has another solid corner - and all B got are two weak stones.]

(;B[lq]TR[dq][ep]C[dada: what's the idea behind this move?
This is the wrong direction. If you have the choice of either
a) making a strong group even stronger, or
b) making a weak group stronger, what would you choose?

In this case the corner stone to the right is strong, the two marked stones are weak.
See variation.];W[fq]C[dada: ouch - B is in trouble.];B[dr]
;W[fp];B[cr];W[br];B[hp]LB[hq:A]C[aheimlich: this stone was supposed to look like sute ishi, but actually be the left side of my lower side territory. again, i'm not too sure if my strategy is sound here.

dada: doesn't look too good to me. If W answers at 'A' (h3) all you did was to strengthen the W stones, what would you play as followup?]
;W[ho]LB[hq:A]C[dada: should be at 'A' instead.];B[hq]C[dada: suicidal :o)]
;W[ip];B[io];W[gp];B[en]TR[hq][hp]LB[eo:A]C[dada: at least the two marked stones have some aji - W can't cut at 'A' (e5) right now.
See variation at next move.]
(;W[dl]LB[ed:A]TR[cr][dr][dq][ep][en][cd][dd][cj]C[dada: perfect! This is almost a book example of a splitting attack. W is splitting the two marked groups. B has to suffer for his unsound play. Note how much better it would be, if B had played at 'A' (e16) earlier and kept the single marked stone closer to his wall above (as seen in the early variation for 'A')]
;B[hn];W[go];B[dp];W[nc]C[dada: ?????
W has to play in the lower left - this is a must!]
(;B[lc]C[dada: same goes for B - what are you thinking about?
Have you already abandoned the lower left?
See variation!];W[jc]TR[ne]LB[ne:A]C[aheimlich: i'm not familiar with this move, so i just follow up as if he played what i thought he would (A).]
;B[le]LB[nd:A][kd:B]C[dada: this should either be at 'A' (o16) or 'B' (l16)]
;W[je];B[hc]LB[nd:A]C[dada: what is the idea behind this move? 'A' (o169 looks like the only move to me.
Black is falling more and more behind. He has weak groups everywhere which W can harrass to his advantage.]
;W[pb];B[nd];W[qf]
(;B[qj]LB[qc:A][qj:B]C[aheimlich: should i have cut at (A) and attempted to keep this corner, or is the side influence at (B) big enough?

dada: 'A' doesn't capture the corner. See variation.
On the other hand separating is always good - I would play 'A' for sure.
Otherwise you create yet another weak group.];W[qd]C[dada: there you have it: W has another corner and your stones are floating without eyes.]
;B[qq]C[ xinjia 17k*: That was a crappy move but ok nonetheless
 xinjia 17k*: I mean the one I made

aheimlich: is this right? r16 looks good to me

dada: r16 is a fine move. W is on the road to victory.
B's move should be one line higher at r4.];W[pn]C[ aheimlich 18k*: r16?
 xinjia 17k*: Yeah
 xinjia 17k*: It was better played at r5

dada: I disagree - r16 makes a strong W group which allows to invade on the right side.
You can't have everything.

 xinjia 17k*: As was r3 better at r5, but... too late now
 xinjia 17k*: After r5 I would have been in deep shimiari :>

dada: r5 leaves a lot of bad aji in the corner - W might be able to live in there later. r4 would have been a sound move.

 aheimlich 18k*: if u were able to play the right joseki on my corner...
 aheimlich 18k*: i would have ended up way behind];B[fd]TR[pd]
[nd][le][lc][qj]C[dada: locally this is feaseable, as it strengthens your exposed left side.
But globally speaking I think there are more urgent moves. The marked stones on the upper side have become VERY weak now.
Furthermore the lone B stone on the right side might come under pressure if W plays again on this side. Actually B has too many weak groups on the board. With exception of the lower right everything is floating. W is thick. Basically no matter how W plays from now on, W should have an easy win.
But as it stands right now, you might reinforce whichever weak group you deem most valuable.]
;W[cf]C[ xinjia 17k*: I was thinking of peeking at e15 first
 xinjia 17k*: This is a good game :)];B[dj]LB[dh:A]C[dada: this doesn't look good. You forget who is attacking who here.
If you play something like this, then at least play at 'A' (d12)]
;W[qp];B[pp];W[qo]C[ aheimlich 18k*: i like that lower left situation. good setup for an exciting middle game
 xinjia 17k*: Why do you think I moved k15?
 xinjia 17k*: I want a presence.
 aheimlich 18k*: k15 is pretty big
 aheimlich 18k*: at least it keeps my moyo small
 xinjia 17k*: It's also related to c14
 aheimlich 18k*: q6 seems pretty similar
 xinjia 17k*: But f16 did a lot of damage to that plan
 xinjia 17k*: q6 is for my secret weapon.
 aheimlich 18k*: u can easily win this game with amashi at this point. but i am prepared for that
 xinjia 17k*: If you figure out q6 I will be very impressed
 xinjia 17k*: If you do there is nothing more this old jedi can teach you.]
;B[pl]C[
 xinjia 17k*: My next move might "let the cat out of the bag" so to speak]
;W[nn];B[jp]C[dada: this removes a lot of aji. With one worry less W might start an attack now.]
;W[iq]C[
 xinjia 17k*: Ok time for my secret weapon

 xinjia 17k*: What do you think, sir?]
(;B[kq]LB[im:A][hm:B]C[aheimlich: i think i should have played (A) or (B) to prevent his next move, but i didn't want him to eat h3. did i "jump the gun" here?

dada: it's hard to come up with a good strategie here. You're already way behind.
See variation for an idea.];W[hm];B[gl];W[in]C[ xinjia 17k*: Also, e5 is a problem

dada: with this capture W gets a foothold in the center. The previous sequence is no longer possible.]
;B[el];W[dn];B[fl]C[dada: good - at least you get some influence for sacrificing your stones.]
;W[dm];B[co]C[aheimlich: this is my last sacrifice down here. i'm hoping to be more than prepared for some seious ko in about 50 moves.]
;W[bo];B[km]TR[nn][pn][qo][qp]C[aheimlich: is this big?

dada: not really - it threatens the marked stones, but doesn't achieve anything else.
W will answer at 'A' (s3) and will live without worries. 'A' is big!  Better to play at 'A' yourself and if W starts running you can always play this mvoe if you like to.]
;W[ik]TR[gn][go][ho][in][hm][fp][gp][fq][gr][qp][qo][pn][nn]
LB[rq:C][eo:A][er:B]C[aheimlich: it would be interesting to know if we have any clue what we're talking about :)

dada: woa!! What is W thinking about?
There's no trouble for the left marked group at all. W can play at 'A' (e5) any time.
And if B plays at 'A' W can run away (and I'm sure would even win the semeai with playing at 'B' (e2) without running away.
The real problem is the marked group on the right. If B plays 'C' (s3) now, W is in trouble.

 aheimlich 18k*: looks like u got about 10 more pts, but your territory is full of trouble
 xinjia 17k*: Trouble? Like what? Do you have a secret weapon?
 aheimlich 18k*: d3 was sute ishi, but threatens to live rather than to kill
 xinjia 17k*: d3 was sute ishi!?
 xinjia 17k*: Are you joking?
 xinjia 17k*: I'm going to send this to the GTL, it will be a famous game.
 aheimlich 18k*: hehehe
 xinjia 17k*: I can feel the power in your stones and I dont like it.
 aheimlich 18k*: i shouldn't have let you out at h6
 aheimlich 18k*: it makes d3 a very bad sacrifice
 aheimlich 18k*: i played it to pull bigger influence from the takamoku at p4
 aheimlich 18k*: and take the entire lower side
 xinjia 17k*: If you enclosed me at h6 I would be out at d8 after capturing h4   xinjia 17k*: Yeah the whole k4 thing destroyed my secret weapon
 xinjia 17k*: I wanted to o3 and connect underneath or come up and capture p4
 aheimlich 18k*: yeah. h6 is a lot closer to r14 and k15, but keeps my left side big]
;B[il]C[dada: should be at s3 of course! You are only strengthening W around here.]
;W[hl];B[im];W[gk];B[ek];W[dh]TR[gk][ik]C[dada: now that W is out in the open (with B's help) this is a lot more serious.]
;B[fj];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[df];W[ce]C[dada: W takes it easy.]
;B[ch];W[dg];B[ef];W[ei];B[fi];W[fh];B[hj];W[hk];B[jn]LB[cg:A]
C[aheimlich: i think i'm preparing for battle and thickening my wall. since the sente here is small, i'm expecting him to do the same somewhere else. am i thinking straight?

dada: no. "Small sente" as you name it is "gote", i.e. the opponent doesn't have to answer.
Can you really afford W playing another move at the top? I think you can't.
I tried some variations starting with 'A' (c13) - but you're too weak around here to save both groups (at the top and and the middle left). Actually I think you're going to lose big here.]
;W[ej]C[aheimlich: re my last comment, is this what i was expecting?

dada: you look pretty dead to me now.];B[hi];W[gg]LB[cg:A]C[dada: W is just too greedy. W should play at 'A' (c13) and the whole left side is his.]
;B[bf];W[cg];B[di];W[eh];B[bg];W[kd]LB[dk:A][gd:B]C[dada: what is W doing?
Now it's time to reap the profit. W should start by cutting at 'A' (d9) and continue around 'B' (g16).]

[ec:C]C[dada: W should atari at 'A' (j13) instead.

;B[ed];W[ee]C[dada: ?];B[gf];W[ff]C[dada: ???
Looks like W wants to get killed.];B[ge];W[eg]C[dada: W is dead - unbelieveable.

And now it's W who's dead.]
(;B[ig]MA[cd][dd][ed][fd][hc][ge][gf]C[aheimlich: white looks bad here, but i don't think the stones with boxes are strong enough to kill just yet, is that true?

 aheimlich 18k*: want to see a big ko?];B[hn]C[aheimlich: kind of like i didn't expect d3 to live, i am not expecting c14 to die, hoping that it is more useful for me as bad white aji than as points.

dada: why play a ko? just connect against the cut - I can't see how you lose.]
;W[gd];B[gc];W[hh]C[dada: unnecessary trouble - you had W killed - now it's a ko - a big one!]
;B[fk]C[aheimlich: since all he is threatening is another ko, i assume it is ok to win this one

;W[gg];B[hd];W[gi];B[if];W[ie];B[he];W[jg];B[jf];W[kh]C[aheimlich: does white's heaviness on the left make taking the upper side a good exchange for his life there?

dada: Learn the difference between gote and sente, and such things as double sente, reverse sente.
Actually, I'll end my review here.

Both of you like to fight. Of course you make mistakes in the fight, such as W getting himself killed in the upper left and then B letting W live again, but things like that happen at your level of play.
What you really should try to understand is the difference between weak stones and strong stones. If you have weak stones the opponent can attack those stones - not to kill them, but to gain territory or influence. Strong stones are immune to attack - they influence their surrounding. Strong stones can be used for attack or help other friendly stones nearby. If you have weak stones you are restricted in your actions: you can't inavde (or a splitting attack might follow), you have to defend, etc. If you have strong stones then you take command of the game.

Key points in this game were:
- move 7&9: giving W a solid corner and overextending --> creates weakness
- move 13 & 15: failing to create a secure base for your invading stone --> creates weakness
- move 37: instead of connecting stones creating another isolated group.
- move 41: failing to cut W and secure a base --> creates weakness
- move 75: failing to take advantage of W's weakness on the right
- move 119: failing to wrap up a capture --> creates opportunities for the opponent
plus some tactical blunders like move #211.

You have fighting spirit. Good. now you need to focus it where it is most useful. Don't just fight because there's an opportunity. Fight with a cause. Furthermore: only start fighting if you are strong in this area. If you are weak then dodge the fight or sacrifice if necessary (see varaition on move 63, where sacrificing three stones gives you a better chance on the board.)

Note what you've achieved so far:
- stabilzed your group on the right side
- given your stones on the top right something to run to if they need help.
- the W group is not yet settled - you might still be able to attack it later on
- the last moves helps your top left stones in a big way, furthermore it threatens the two marked stones. You might be able to engineer a splitting attack.
