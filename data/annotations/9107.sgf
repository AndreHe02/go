C[[L\]Hi - all my comments will be marked by "[L\]"
After watching your game my biggest suggestion is for you to study a lots of life and death problems. They will help to improve your game significantly. In your game you made a few groups that were easy to kill (though it took B long time to notice). When you study these problems, you will learn how to notice dead shapes and how to avoid making them. Learning other stuff like joseki and middle game can come later - tesuji should be your priority number one. I hope my comments will help you to some degree, but studying life and death problems will do you the best service.

Good luck with your future games and don't get discouraged - it can be fun and educational even when you lose.

And to answer your question - W group at the end of the game in lower left is dead - check out some solutions]
