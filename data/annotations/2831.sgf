C[Dear reviewer,

thank you very much for spending your time on this game.

Altough I had to resign because I made a big mistake, I think that having this game reviewed would help me very much.

There were a lot of situations in which I was not sure what to do.
Maybe that is not unusual ;)

I added some questions, but please feel free to comment obvious mistakes as well.

Thank you very much,

(;W[dr]TR[jq]C[I think it would be better to simply play k3 instead. It gives a better relation to the p4-stones, and the c3-corner is still open for invasion]
;B[cq];W[iq]C[I do not know if I can feel content with this fuseki.

You have fallen behind a little bit because the q3-p4 combination is slow, and j3 is low + a bit far away from p4]
;B[cf];W[df]TR[fc][ch]C[Maybe this is not the proper joseki because I do not have a stone around K16?

Right!

I would have played f17 instead
Maybe you can even play a pincer, but that might be an overplay with the black d6-stone]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[ce];W[cd];B[dj]C[Is this move correct? Black now has a lot of stones on the 4th line and this move leaves some aji because of the cut at C13 to exploit later on...

I agree. I think black should have played c11 instead]
(;W[pd]C[I think I should have put the strength in the upper left to better use. Maybe a kakari around P17 is more appropriate?

Yes, this way black gets to choose the direction of play. My choice whould have been o16 or p16]
;B[qd];W[pe];B[ob];W[md];B[lc];W[jc];B[hc];W[fc];B[jb]
(;W[qi]TR[qk]C[Is this move a good choice?
I wanted to make a base here and prevent Black from extending here

I can understand your feeling, but I think you should play tighter on black:  Playing r9 instead leaves him without much of a base]
;B[rq]C[this is big, too...];W[qe]TR[qi]C[Small, isn`t it?

It is quite big, but r11 is a bit too close to your strength now
I think that moving with the k17-stone is more urgent];B[kq]
C[Now I should have a target to attack. But it slips through my fingers soon.

It is very difficult to attack this stone now because black has no other weak positions + you have to be careful about your q3-p4-stones]
;W[mq]C[This looks like the only move to me. But at the same time it means that there is no attac on l3]
;B[ko];W[ib]TR[kb]SQ[jd]C[I did not know how to attack correctly at the bottom and played some moves here instead. Maybe aji-kechi...

I wouldn't call it aji-kechi. I whould have played here earlier. 
It is difficult to choose between j18 and l18, but if you wait then black will play k16.

In this position however I think the matter of your p4-stones is more important. They look rather weak]

I can't see any good coming from this move];B[kp];W[jn]C[Maybe one line to the left at J6. Cutting would then not be so easy for Black

How do I attack the black stones? Maybe there is a way to do so which supports an invasion of the left side.

I don't think you can attack any more. You need to defend the p4-stones.
l7 is the only move that looks like an attack, but it is no good.]

;B[ld];W[cl]C[I felt that Black was ahead and tried an invasion.

Maybe getting to the center is more difficult because of the Black stones there, but I hoped to get some support from the threat of cutting at C13.

This sounds like a good strategy in this position];B[cm];W[bh]
;B[ch];W[bg];B[cg]C[Do you see an easy way for White to handle this situation. And - if White could live easily - should Black just sacrifice his two stones?]

(;W[ci];B[di];W[cj]C[I knew that B9 would come next, but my intention was to get some more liberties and then somehow connect around B15. Not the best plan, maybe. But I could not see a way to live here anyway.

Do you see any prospects here or should I just switch to another place on the board?

(;W[bi]C[This looks like the natural start. 

Black must either block at b14 or keep the white b12-group at 5 liberties]

(;B[cj]TR[bj]C[Now white has 6 liberties, so he can connect.

Maybe it is possible to play b10 first for some extra points, but then you need to be sure to live if black breaks the connection.]
