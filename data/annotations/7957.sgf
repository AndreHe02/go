AB[dp][pd][pp]C[Hey Bashan,

i will try to comment your game. i do not play many handicap games. Furthermore your opponent is nearly as strong as me (6 Kyu on KGS). But i will try. 
All comments are made in respect to black.

Alex];W[dd];B[gc]LB[fc:A]C[this is a unusable move. i would not play it, but it is playable. I prefer A in this context. A puts more pressure on the white corner.]
;W[nc];B[jc];W[qf]C[Bashan [10k\]: Maybe I gave my hoshi stones away too cheaply? (repeats at SW corner later.)

Yes, you did. 
it starts with K17. It is a small move and there was not need to strenghen G17. Black R14 would have been better to strenghe the attacked corner and get some territory.]
;B[qh]LB[oe:B][qc:A]C[here you should have protected the corner with A or at least get out with the B. A gets a base. B aim towards the center.
But the mistake was the move before.];W[qc]
(;B[oh];W[of];B[mq];W[ql];B[ol]LB[cf:C][dj:B][qn:A]C[too agressive.

localy better is A. takes some territory, althought it does not secure the corner

bigger moves are: B and C];W[on];B[pm];W[ro];B[pn];W[pj];B[mh]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[rq];B[qo];W[rp];B[qr];W[qn];B[oo]LB[po:A]C[i think this was an overplay. A would have been the proper move. see next comment and variation]
;W[qm];B[dj]LB[po:A]C[Bashan [10k\]: at this point, I was still happy

well, the fight at the right side turned out alright and in sente for you. But the weakness is Q5, where a for dangoures ko-fight could begin.]
(;W[fq];B[hq]LB[cn:A]C[A would have been better. you get drawn into the same behavior as in the upper right corner. H3 does not do you any good.]
;W[cn];B[cf]C[C14 is not a good tenuki, because your D4 and H3 stones are  weak.]
;W[fc];B[ge];W[eo];B[cc];W[cd]
(;B[fp]C[i know the normal rule is to attack from the outside. But here your stone has still the ability to live or get out. See variations.]

i am not sure what you mean. if you explain me i can try to answer.]

;W[dh];B[dg];W[ci];B[bh];W[gj]C[C4 or c8 would have been bigger.]
(;B[be];W[bd];B[gb];W[fb];B[ed]C[Bashan [10k\]: I thought I could take advantage of the empty triangle, but that didn't work
bwalsh5001 [7k\]: yeah];W[nj]LB[il:B][kl:A]C[i think black stone around A would have created a mojo on the lower side. maybe better at B to protected the cut at F6]
;B[mf]C[this is to aggressive. white just cuts through.];W[ng]
C[bwalsh5001 [7k\]: i was really afraid of c8 for a long time
Bashan [10k\]: yeah, I had hoped to play it, but I didn't feel as strongly about it since it felt too tight

no, C8 is not to tight. it seperates to white groups, which are not living. imagine black C4. Furthermore the attack on the seperated white E10 group would have allowed you to build a big mojo on the lower side, if not territory.]

i dont see a way to connect either.
it is here better to defend the lower side with a move like A. there are the most points to gain.]

(;W[fm];B[fn];W[jm]C[Bashan [10k\]: I think what decided the game was that W could get so deep into B's moyo here in the following moves.
Bashan [10k\]: Score estimator still thinks B is winning at this time

you are right.];B[mk];W[ln];B[kp];W[jn];B[jo];W[mp]
(;B[np]C[M3 is better see variations.

some general advice:

- play a little more defensive, i mean try to protected important cuts before you tenuki. a solid group brings more earnings in the end. i know it is always a balance act between protecting and not losing the initiative.
- try to look for the bigger points. to find these points always ckeck the empty spaces on the board. there  a single stone has more influence than in a crowded area. think about the direction in which the stones should move so that you get influence and territory.
- do not lose your corners like that. 

i hope you find my comments useful.
