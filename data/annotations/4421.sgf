This is correct, this is a standard sequence in this situation.]

no, i don't see how. but escaping into the center is no shame. you should have done so earlier!

at this point, if you do a count, you'll see that you're about even, so you could leave the stones on the left side and try to win the game by finding territory elsewhere.]
