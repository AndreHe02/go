C[This is a game I played with my classmate.
This is a funny game, the centre is empty. I thought I was loosing. Is there something that black did wrong?
Thank you for reviewing this game.
First time writing comments for my own game, don't know if it is right or wrong. And can you tell which kyu I am in by watching the game? if yes, can you please tell me which kyu I am in? thx

Review by:
JL = Jarkko Lindblad (IGS 1-3d, Finnish 1 kyu)

You (w) were losing, but due to ignoring proper moves for a looong time you got lucky :)  In addition to comments, I added a short summary to the end.]
;B[cp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[eq];W[fp]C[JL: while this is possible, it is a bit early to give opponent solid territory.]
;B[fq];W[gp]LB[cf:A][co:B]C[chose white 6,8 because white 2 and 4 are in the star position.
have also thought of point a for 8.

JL: When you play the shoulder-hits, you also make a move of 'b' tempting in the future.]
;B[ce]C[This is the biggest move];W[jc]LB[cj:a]C[thinking of a for 10. but white 10 seems to be the biggest. it stops the area extension of black 3 and 9 and also extension of white 2.
the other feeling is if I play a, black would play 10 and it seems to be giving pace to black.

JL: this is the right area to play now. Reduces the black influence well and builds moyo.]
;B[qj]C[if white plays at 11, white will have a really big moya which will give black a very difficult time.]
;W[qg];B[qm];W[dj]SQ[fp][gp]LB[nq:a]C[i feel that I should have played at a. this would prevent the problem of black's invasion later on in the game.

JL: this is really the first move that needs any critizism. I see little value in this move - it just sits there withoput corrdinating with the other stones at all creating a new group when you already have two eyeless stones floaring in the center (the marked stones). Playing at 'a' or perhaps one step to the left of it would have been much better.]
;B[gq]LB[co:B][hq:A][nq:C]C[would it be faster to play at a?

JL: yes, although it would leave move aji in the corner. Anyhow, this black move is quite slow and white can ignore it treating the two stones lightly. Actually as white I would now consider playing tsuke 'B' (although white 'C' is important). Instead of the move played, black might have wanted to play 'C' to attack the corner and later jumped to 'A'.]
;W[hp]LB[nq:A]C[JL: this move is slow in my opion. I would probably have played a keima of 'A' to make the corner strong and make black H4 less effective.]
;B[iq];W[jo]LB[jq:A]C[JL: if you build a wall like this, it looks like the right hand side  bottom corner will be in trouble assuming black played 'A' now. After the white hoshi-stone feels really lonely.]
;B[hq]C[don't understand 19

JL: while this movee is very solid, K3 would have been much faster.]
;W[jq]SQ[hq]LB[nq:A][oc:B]C[JL: this move has little effect on black and is thin. This position is very different from the position where black has not played the marked stone. Better moves would have been 'A' and 'B' for example, latter being very very big.]
;B[dm]SQ[fp][gp][hp][jo][jq]LB[dl:A]C[JL: this move is quite loose and there is lots of aji left behind, but since white is very very thin here, it looks quite ok. Actually I might have wanted to attack even further away at 'A'. The marked stones are now nothing more but a target for attack and the lone stone in the left hand side is also now weak.]
;W[dg]LB[df:A]C[JL: this looks like a good move as it co-operates with the white stones in the top. White would like to close the black corner inside. You could also have jumped one step move at 'A']
;B[hc]LB[jp:A]C[JL: wrong direction. Black should have played at 'A' or something similar to attack the weak white group and to create weaknesses.Divide and conquer.]
;W[ld]LB[je:a]C[would this be better at a?

JL: probably. The invasion in the corner is still possible, so this move feels too close to the wall white will get. Black should probably invade now and try to get sente to attack.]
;B[qc]C[is 25 big or is it bad? because it strengthens white on the outside.

JL: This is just the right timing - white tried to create a huge corner with it's previous move, so it is just logical for black to invade at the last possible moment. While white will become strong white is not weak anywhere, so it will be hard to use the thickness. Also white will be overconcentrated because of the previous move. The upside is the the weak stones on the bottom will now be a bit stronger.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[qb];B[rb]LB[qf:A]C[JL: according to Ishida Yoshio 9 dan black just made a big mistake. Instead a tsuke of 'A' is the joseki.]
;W[pb];B[qe];W[pe]LB[pf:A]C[JL: why not jump ahead? 'A' would have been better.]
;B[qf]
(;W[pf]SQ[qj][qm]LB[pg:A]C[JL: again, 'A' would have been better - white has nothing to fear from the cuts as cutting would make the marked stones weaker. See variation in the previous node]
;B[rg];W[rh];B[qh];W[pg];B[ri]TR[ld]LB[je:a][sb:A]C[the mark stone would be better if played at a

JL: indeed. Both played must also now realize that white 'A' is now possible.endgame move.]
;W[gd]LB[db:B][fc:A]C[JL: I don't like this move. You lose the invasion of 'A' (and possible 'B' as well)]
;B[gc]LB[hd:a]C[is 41 playing at a "war" and playing at 41"peace"?
but isn't this showing that you fear your opponent? would a be more positive?

JL: Perhaps, but the black move is solid. I would have played at 'a' though as it is more positive like you said. Also the center looks awfully white now.]
;W[fd];B[hd]LB[fc:A]C[JL: a big mistake - now white must play 'A'. After that black has a weak group and even the corner becomes less secure.]
;W[he]LB[jd:A]C[JL: big mistake. this move let's black off the hook, and helps him make shape with 'A'.]
;B[fc]C[JL: this is a cowardly way of playing.];W[qo]C[feel something strange about the lower right corner. white looks like it is in danger, but I don't know what the danger is, also don't want black to play somewhere around S4.

JL: this is a big move (and you need points to win this game). The problem is that white is thin all over the place except for top right. The white stones are not connected.]
;B[on]TR[dj]LB[kq:C][np:A][nq:B][or:D]C[is this flattening a Moya and also aiming at point a of invasion?

This is one of the reason why I think white 14 should play at b at the beginning of the game

JL: I this is a bad move. Moves in the neighbourhood of 'c' look more interesting. The move black played prevents black from playing 'd' which is probably the move black should play first as a probe.]
;W[oj]LB[no:a]C[struggling to dicide a or 48. but I have been aiming at the centre throughout the whole game, really don't want to give up.]
;B[ck]LB[id:A]C[is this threatening the life of white 14 and 22 by taking away the eye space of white and also extension and settle down for black?

JL: black made a mistake. Moves like this are of bad style and usually help the opponent more than oneself. White can ignore this move and play at  'A' or in the neighbourhood to build the center and fix weaknesses.]
;W[dk]C[feel that I would definately lose if I start getting territory now. My only hope is the centre.

JL: locally this is probably the better of the two pushes. And you're right - black leads in territory - after all, white forced him to take lots of it.]
;B[cj]C[my classmate seem to like territory alot];W[el]LB[di:A]
[dl:B]C[trying to block black from the centre

JL: my first reaction to this move was "ugly" - the shape looks wrong (and is a bad one) - first, the move is slow, second, it is rather heavy, and third, imagine black at some point of the game playing at 'A' - after that it does not matter which player playes at 'B' it won't look pretty for white. White should have secured the top of his moyo as told before. Locally it would have been better for white to finnish this sequence with b + a hane and even try to loosely connect to the bottom weak stones.]
;B[pj]C[no idea what black is doing...

JL: the game should even a bit now.];W[ok];B[np];W[qk]C[JL: black is happy for this - white gives him territory and removes bad aji here.]
;B[pk];W[pl];B[ql];W[ol];B[pq]LB[ie:A]C[JL: intereesting move, but probably bad one. I'd now cut at 'A' as the center is beginning to look bad.]
;W[qq];B[kq];W[jr]C[JL: This is the fighting move.];B[lq]C[JL: black is overly conerned with this area - he can either connect or live, so playing like this is a pity.]
;W[jp];B[mn]LB[jm:C][oq:A][pr:B]C[is this  "shape"? (sorry for the poor GO technical terms.... learnt them in chinese...)

JL: there are many shapes and this is very solid. It is a bad move of course still, as black should play at 'A' or maybe 'B' ro settle the corner (in sente) first. After that I'd like to move faster to the center. Perhaps by attacking at 'C' and making a light group to the center..]
;W[lm]C[JL: seems like a nice move locally.];B[mm];W[mk]LB[ml:A]
C[JL: what's wrong with the regular hane of 'A'?];B[fn]LB[ie:A]
C[JL: i don't like this mvoe either, but still the top is most urgent (A).]
;W[en];B[em];W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[dl];W[ek];B[eo]C[JL: I think this is to small, but might be wrong. Black desperately needs to do something to the center and nothign fight for pennies.]
;W[dn]C[JL: ???];B[cn];W[gn];B[fo];W[ep];B[do]LB[id:A][ln:B]
C[for some odd reason I feel that black is letting me block him away from the centre. or is this the best move he can get with maximum sente?

JL: how is black getting sente here? If white get's to play 'A' and 'B', black can resign. Even getting to play 'A' is big enough to give some gray hair to black. An all black game has turned into a good looking game for white.]
;W[ci]C[JL: small and wrng direction.];B[cg]C[JL: black should enter the center. It is too big.]
;W[cf];B[df];W[bf];B[dh];W[eg];B[ch];W[bi];B[fk];W[eh];B[be]
LB[di:A]C[JL: I don't understand why black doesn't atari at 'A'...]
;W[ef]LB[di:A]C[JL: locally speaking, preventing the atari of 'A' is much bigger]
;B[de];W[ff]LB[di:B][ee:A]C[should play at a

JL: neither player should have been playing in this region at all :) And locally speaking, 'a' would be a move worth perhaps a few points - perhaps there are bigger ones? Imagine what happens to the "territory" when black plays at 'B' and forces white to run.]
;B[ee]C[JL:  honestly, I don't understand this move. What does it do?]
;W[fe]C[JL: see previous comment.];B[ed]C[JL: all these moves are ridicilously small to be played for another 100 moves. You both are wasting ko-threats and playing for really few points.]
;W[bg]SQ[dj][dk][ek][el]LB[bh:B][di:A]C[JL: this is not good as black can get extra liberties with A and forcing white to run with the marked stones before going back to B and killing the three white stones. Instead simply play A.]
;B[ie];W[hf]LB[if:a]C[should play at a

JL: no, this is probably better.];B[id]C[JL: no reason to play this shape. Hanging connection is better.]
;W[jg]SQ[cg][ch][dh]LB[if:A][kf:B]C[a would be better?

JL: probably not, but still this is quite trivial. The earlier misdirectional play is more important. The optimal move in this shape seems to be 'B', but as the marked stones still have some aji, that might be an overplay.]
;B[if];W[ig];B[ke]
(;W[kd]C[JL: Could black push trough here? This white move was worth one point in reverse-sente. Pushing the other was was bigger.]
;B[kf]
(;W[rc]LB[sb:A]C[JL: isn't 'A' the right move locally? This is still too early (=too small and unimportant at this time).]
;B[sc];W[rd];B[re];W[ra];B[sd];W[sb]C[JL: there are many bigger moves available and black should just ignore this and fight it later.]

[bf][bg][bi][bj][bk][cf][ci]LB[ei:A][fi:B][gi:C]C[which is the move that make black lose the game? Is black leading at the beginning? thankyou for reviewing the game for me and apologize for the poor english.

JL: Black wins if he realizes the following - atari 'A', atari 'B', then 'C. The marked white stones all die.Failing to see this indicates a major lack of reading skill - this is a priority for you both. Anyhow, your english was fine, and the game looked fine for the first moves. The first move you thought was bad, actually was the first bad move. There were several problems that were commond for the both of you: Direction of play - what is important, what is big - these issues need fixing - experience and studying pro games will help. You also both need better reading skills - playing a lot (and quite fast) and/or doing lots of simple life&death-problems helps. You should play both fast and slow games - fast games to force you to read quickly, slow ones to give you time to think of the right direction of play - a tesuji can be a bad move if played at the wrong time. Also in the endgame you should calculate the point value of each move, understand the effects of sente and gote and play accordingly. Oh, and when fighting, look around - it is easy to just fight for fighting and forget the plan - always think of ways of getting sente and making the first tenuki.

JL: It is hard to estimate the ranks of the players. Anything between about 10 kyu and 20 kyu might be right.]
