C[davbouv:
In this game I (white) managed to kill a black group at an early stage. Then black has played quite aggressively (that's my feeling) to catch up and I have played too defensively (still my feeling) because I didn't want to be involved in a messy fight. In particular I am not satisfied with the right side: I have let black make too much territory in the upper part and was probably to kind in the lower corner. I would welcome any comment about the 155 first moves, particularly about the pincers played by black and the way to deal with. Thanks. David BOUVIER]
;B[dp]C[davbouv [11k\]: you too];W[pq];B[pd];W[dc];B[cd]C[this seems a little odd, if not obviously wrong.  C14 would be normal]
;W[cg];B[cc];W[dd];B[de]C[I think this is a mistake, it leaves a dangerous cutting point unnecessarily.]
;W[ce]C[white seems to agree with me.];B[cf]
(;W[df]C[error.  white should extend down]
(;B[bf]C[black should capture];W[ee];B[be];W[dg];B[db];W[eb]
;B[cb];W[nc]C[davnouv: may be I shouldn't have played so far, it seems there is a deffect in the white group on the left, and the result on the upper-side in the actual game could have been better for black (see move 27 and variation)]
;B[lc];W[ne]TR[jc]C[white should play at k17.  Allowing black the extension for free is too good for black]
;B[fc]C[this is too aggressive - it leaves white with a stronger shape and black with a weak
stone.  Maybe h17.];W[ec];B[fb];W[ea]
(;B[oc]C[davbouv: I think black could have avoid being splitted if had played J17 or somewhere around]
;W[nb];B[ob];W[jc];B[md];W[nd];B[id];W[jd]C[black is really compounding his error by creating two weak groups]
;B[kd]C[not good.  k15 or m15 would be better.];W[je];B[ke]

;W[ha];B[he];W[hf];B[if];W[gf];B[jf];W[ka]C[this whole fight is silly for black - even if black wins (lives) white will have an
overwhelming thickness as a result.
\]];B[la];W[lb];B[mb];W[ma];B[kc];W[mc];B[lf];W[me]C[davbouv: I wanted to give him a bad shape, but I think this move was too slack. R14 seems better to me.

Right.  Chasing and killing the black stones is questionable.  Just chasing them
without killing them is definitely bad.];B[pf];W[ng]C[bad choice for white.  Tenuke and play any of the big points on the sides.]
;B[ph];W[qn];B[qk]C[davbouv: I have let (helped?) black to make territory on the right side, although he still has a weak group.
 I guess I should have resume the attack against it rather than playing in the lower left corner. How to do so? Starting with L13?

No.  You're unlikely to kill the black group, and chasing them will only make your
postiion worse.  Perhaps F4 aiming to make good territory on the bottom or left, depending on
the response.  Defintely, the sides are where the action is at this point.  Maybe after more
development there will be an opportunity to attack the blacks again, or more likely, black will have to  play more conservatively to keep them alive and you'll gain as a consequence.  Nothing so crass
as a direct threat is called for.]
(;W[fq]C[I would have played F4 so black woould probably respond toward the corner.]
;B[hq]C[this is correct for black I think.  Aim to prevent white making any big territories.]
;W[jq]C[I think white has to run out first, maybe come back here later, depending.]

;B[dn];W[bm];B[cl]
(;W[dj];B[bl];W[bn];B[bi]C[not a good choice for black.  the territory in question is at the lower right now.
Something like M3 would be good.];W[ci]C[davbouv: moves 87 and 88 are probably  not worthwhile.   Right.]
;B[ii]C[this is quesitonable.  The fate of these stones should be on black's mind,  but the play should be indirect.  The idea is to get some "friends" on the board
with sente.   Either k4 or m4 would start a local fight which would end up with
friendly & reachable black stones and less white territory than this variation.]
;W[jo];B[np]C[I don't think black can do this, because he has to be very careful
about any white stones placed closer to the top center black group.]
;W[mq];B[nq];W[mp];B[pp]
(;W[oq]C[davbouv: I think I have lost the game here. I was to kind with black.
 I think I should not have abandoned R6 (and I'd rather have played R4 instead of P3)]
;B[qp];W[op];B[pn];W[no];B[oo];W[qq];B[rp];W[on];B[po];W[om]
;B[pm];W[ol];B[mo]C[davbouv: isn't N5 overplayed? Once again I have been too slack, O2 was very bad I should have connected at P6.]
;W[nr];B[nn];W[np];B[ln]C[black is creating another weak group.  All white has to do is play between (say, L8)
and thinkgs will do badly.];W[nm];B[ll]C[poor choice for white, good choice for black.  the stone at o6 is
not important at this point.  Gettting a little eye shape for the main group
is the game.];W[nj];B[mn];W[mm];B[lm];W[mi];B[mk];W[nk];B[kh]
;W[mg]C[I don't thing white has to protect his connection
here, but it's already too late to kill black.];B[kj];W[oa]
C[there are much bigger points than this.  G11 for example.  Black should have allowed
white this minor point (10 points or so) and taken the big point at G11.  If black isn't too
aggressive, it witll end in sente and then can continue locally as played here.]

safe thing is to play R7 now, and eliminate the funny business.  T4 is probably also
Ok .  Bad and complicated things can ensue if white cuts at R7 now. See variation.]

(;W[sr];B[sp];W[rr];B[oh]C[davbouv: I guess black shoud have played R7 (see later on)

Definitely.];W[qm];B[rn];W[rm];B[ro];W[rl]C[davbouv: I don't see anyway to kill black. I was under stress because of the clock and didn't think about a seki which was easy to reach
and would have changed the result of the game.];B[rk]

 Both players have a tendancy to get lost in local tactics, when the right
thing is to look at more of the board.  Not all fights are worth winning,
and for sure not all are worth starting.

The natural tendancy is to "dig in" when threatened, but often the  best response is to turn the threatened stones into an asset by
forcing you oppoent to play conservatively to maintain his threat.]
