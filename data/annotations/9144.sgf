So even though you had a big loss locally, you can still make a good result because of the global situation.]

Michael: I get the feeling that the person you played is probably at least a rank or two stronger than their 13k rank suggests.  He feels more like a 10-9k at least from this one game.  So I wouldn't feel too bad losing to him with a 4 handi.

As far as suggestions for making your play better:  I encourage you to stop, step back and look at the bigger picture.  You follow your opponent around quite a bit and this suggests that you're not sure what is big and what is not.  Ignore a threat and take sente to take a bigger point.  It might mean that you lose a few points locally, but that's OK because you got more points by playing away.

You played a bit aggressively in the opening which is odd because you're ahead in a handicap game.  Don't be afraid to let your opponent have something for himself.  Go is about making trades.  You give a little, you get a little.  The hard part is choosing which trades to make.

Keep an eye out for weaknesses left behind.  Be mindful of the sorts of shapes you're making.]
