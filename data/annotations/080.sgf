;B[rc]L[qo]C[You don't need to answer here. For example, you could consider
 to play at "a", to make the lower-edge good shape.];W[pc];B[re];W[ep]L[lc][kc]C[White should playan extension at "a" or "b". A black move
 there would leave the white stones around p16 without a base to live.]
;B[gq]L[hp][ip]C[Good direction, any of the moves g3, "a", or "b" look good.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[dp];B[eq];W[fq]
(;B[fr]C[Black "a" is also possible, see variation "joseki".];W[fp]C[Although a joseki variation this move is not good for white
 here. The reason is in diagram "ladder". An alternative way for white
 is in diagram "better line".]
(;B[cr]L[co]C[As mentioned, this move could be at "a".];W[co];B[bq];W
[gp];B[hq];W[po]M[gp][hq]L[bp]C[I would play "a" here, probably without the marked exchange.
 The white shape on the left doesn't feel good to leave like this.];B[qo]
L[cf][fc][pl]M[hq]C[Because of the marked stone (solid position) it's not really
 valuable to settle yourself in the lower-right. Two areas which attract
 my attention: upper-left ("a", or "b"), or a pincer along the right
 side (around "c").];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[nq]C[Now you are approaching your own (strong) position.]
;W[qi];B[bo]C[An impressive move, very big but hard to play because it feels slow.
A good move Rob];W[cn];B[cf]L[bm][fc]C[Wrong direction since white is open along the left side ("a").
 The concept of being "open" somewhere is important. Basically it
 means that white has to add another move sometime, making the
 profit worth about half the usual value.
 So, as you will understand now, "b" is the right direction here
 (inviting white to invest stones at the worthless left edge).];W[ce];B
[df];W[fd];B[dj];W[ck]C[Bad move, for the reason previously mentioned.]
;B[cj];W[dk];B[bn]L[ej][kc]C[Way too small, "a" or "b" seems more interesting.]
;W[cm];B[hc]L[kc][nc]C[Playing at "a" instead would ensure you of a base for your
 group (next is either "b" or "h17").];W[kc]C[This moves serves two purposes: an extension for the white group in the upper-right, and an attack on your stone. You shouldn't
have given your opponent this opportunity. That's part of the game,
playing strong moves, but also preventing attractive moves to your
opponent.];B[fb]L[ec][he][ke][cc]C[A bit soft, "a" seems more interesting. Another (more leasurely)
 approach would be to jump to "b", with follow-up's at either "c", or "d".]
;W[db];B[he]M[fb][db]L[cc]C[You can see the difference now, because of the marked exchange you
 lost the opportunity at "a". The marked exchange feels aji-keshi now.]
;W[ff];B[eg]L[ke]C[Seems inefficient to me. I would just jump to "a", and let the left group fight for itself.]
;W[gf];B[if];W[gh];B[mc]C[Interesting.];W[md];B[lc];W[ld];B[kb];W[nc];B
[jc];W[kd];B[jb]L[mb][ob]C[Could be "a" as well, with "b" as follow-up later on. The move you played
doesn't "hurt" your opponent.];W[rb];B[pf]L[sb][sc]C[First play "a", because "b" is painful for your shape.]
;W[nf];B[sb];W[qb]L[ra]C[Better at "a", in the endgame the same, but better (larger) eye space.]
;B[hp]L[rg][qk]C[Black "a" would strengthen your group and prepare for "b".]
;W[ej];B[dh];W[bh];B[bi];W[bf];B[ch];W[cg];B[dg]L[ah][bg]C[Would white ever want to play here? :-)
 This move erases the possibility to give atari at "a" (or maybe even
 a throw-in at "b") later on. Be careful with this kind of move, they
 can be the difference between life and death.];W[bg];B[ee];W[ed];B[fe]
;W[ge];B[gd]C[A dangerous cut. Since both white groups seem quite strong the cut has
 gote flavor.];W[fh];B[ei];W[fj];B[bk];W[bl];B[aj];W[de];B[ef];W[fi]L[hj]
C[White is worried about a cut here, but this way of defending is inefficient. Better around "a".]
;B[ho];W[gn];B[hn]L[im]C[Better keima at "a", it's quicker.];W[gm]L[mn]C[Too small, "a" is bigger.];B[on];W[pn];B[no];W[rg]C[Hard to black.]
;B[qg];W[rh];B[rf];W[pe];B[og];W[qe];B[qf];W[oi];B[nh];W[nb];B[ni];W[nj]
;B[kh];W[mj];B[li];W[kn];B[kp];W[hm];B[im];W[il];B[jm];W[lm];B[om];W[ol]
;B[nl];W[pl];B[ll]L[jo]C[You don't need to kill these stones, just "a" is ok, you're doing fine.]
;W[kl];B[ml]L[km]C[Why not cut at "a" instead?];W[jl];B[km]C[Hmm :-)]
;W[in];C[You resign too early Rob! This capture is 6 points + some additional endgame value. But a big endgame move is also 10 points, so it's not game deciding yet.]

(;N[ladder];B[co]C[This answer looks very risky for black considering all cutting
points. But actually white is in trouble now.];W[gr];B[er];W[hr]L[hq]
M[re]C[The best white can do since the ladder at "a" doesn't work
because of the marked stone.];B[cr];W[hp]L[iq][go][hq][gp]C[The end of this variation. Since black has still aji with
the g3 stone this result is better for him. The aji could be a peep
at "a" or "b", or maybe even escape with "c" or "d" when black gets
stones in the vicinity.])
(;AE[fp]N[Better line];W[co]C[This move (preventing a black move here) promises white
an equal result. Now the exchange "a", "b" is ok for white, so ...];B[bp]
;W[fp];B[dr]L[gr]C[Defending the cut at "a" efficiently.];W[bo];B[bq]
;W[gp];B[hq];W[cj]M[hq][pq]C[This is the end of the joseki (Ishida, part II, page 88).
Black is slightly unhappy because of the low position of both marked
stones.]))
