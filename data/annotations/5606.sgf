C[Hi, My name is David and i will review your game...
I hope that this review will be useful to you...
In this review, (W) means that the comment will be onto the white move and (B) on the black move.

David Ormeno
Arcanus 5k KGS];B[dp];W[cd];B[qp];W[qc]C[This its a very interesting opening for both players.]
;B[ec];W[dc]LB[ed:A][gc:B][de:C][dg:D]SQ[dd]C[(W) If white want to play a more complicated game the moves could be the A to D moves (try yourself and see what could happen, its a good exercices, it helps a lot).

(B)The next move its a little narrow and can put in danger black, so this its a normal response for white.
As i say, the next move could be played in other places but this its not a bad move, others common choices are  at A(its a good move for both) and at the square on D16 . A its a very common play, and can be played something like this.See variation.]

(;B[hc]LB[ed:A][dd:B];W[df];B[pe]LB[pd:A][qe:B]C[(W):  this its a dangeorus move, so white have to think a lot of using aproacching moves like A or B. 

(B): this its very interesting move, so black have to take advantage of the group on H17, even if its still not secure(it doesnt have eyes yet and can be attack at   F17(]

(;W[nc]LB[od:A]C[(W): good move, but i guess that A, will be a little better see variations.]
;B[pi]C[A big point, a good move.];W[qg];B[ql]C[Another big point for black, but he forget the white stone at R13, that diminish his territory.]
;W[rj]
(;B[rk]C[There are better moves, remember that on the beggining of game crawl on the edge its not a good way of play. See variation.]
;W[ri]
(;B[oq]C[This move could be more ambitious. See variation.]

(;W[re]C[(W) As i say before, crawling its not a good way of play in the beggining, so maybe atack the stone at Q15 its better. See variations.]
;B[dh]
(;W[og]C[(W) this move its a little slow, black its taking big points, but not all, so white can take them too. See variations.]
;B[ni];W[mg]C[(W): good move, secure, and remember that a one point jump its never a bad move if you think it before.]

(;B[nh]C[(B): attacking the cutting points in this ways only make your opponent stones more powerfull, so if you want to attack this points, i suggest that a direct cut its interesting. See variation]
;W[ng]
(;B[cg]C[(B): This moves its not as big as others on the board, try to take big spaces then more smalls. See variations.]
;W[cf];B[dk]C[Big point for black];W[kc]C[White its threaten the group at H17, so black has to answer the move.]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[db];W[cb];B[eb];W[jq]C[Good move for white, but maybe a little low, white can live without too much trouble, but it can be sorrounded, so maybe K4 would do the trick better.]
;B[lq];W[gq];B[eq];W[ko];B[mn];W[mp]C[(W) A very risky move, it can be cut.

(B) maybe cut its a better move, but y O5 its not a bad move, cuz its protected your framework.]

(;B[no];W[lp]C[(W): good response];B[mq]
(;W[kq]C[(W): white can still attack the right side. See variation.]
;B[cn]C[A big point.];W[fo];B[fm]
(;W[go]C[A good choice, but i guess that H6 could be better.]
;B[gg]C[This its a big point again, white has to do a lot of effort to take the territory that need to win, and did very good on the ongoing game.]
;W[np];B[op];W[nq];B[nr];W[or];B[pr];W[mr];B[os];W[lr];B[fe]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[ee];B[mk];W[em]C[(W): interesting move, it works good with the big group on the G5.

(B): too overprotective, maybe a more fierce move like F8, could be good.]

(;B[dl];W[en];B[el];W[fl];B[fk];W[gl];B[gk];W[hl];B[ij];W[jl]
;B[ik]C[(B): Again, dont try to cut, its only strengthen your oponent.]
;W[il];B[kk];W[ke]C[(W): an important move, good choice.];B[jg]
;W[ie];B[he];W[if];B[ig];W[hf];B[gf];W[id];B[hd];W[ib];B[hb]
;W[jc];B[ic]C[(W): this its gote, you dont really need to answer it.]
;W[ja];B[lh];W[lg];B[kh];W[hk];B[hj];W[jk];B[jj];W[kl];B[lk]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[mo];B[nn];W[ln]C[(B): you can still defend your territory with a more attacking move. See variation.]

(;B[cq];W[do];B[co];W[ep];B[fp];W[eo];B[fr]C[(B) good choice, it gives you more territory than saving your stone at F4.]
;W[fq];B[gr];W[hr];B[er];W[hq]C[Black takes the sente (initiative, gote its the oposite)]
;B[gs]C[(B): there are still more big moves for black, this its too small.]
;W[hs];B[kn];W[mm];B[nm];W[lm];B[qj];W[qi];B[pj];W[ph];B[oi]

(;W[mh]C[(W): B13 would be a better move, it takes more territory.]
;B[mi];W[kf];B[bg];W[bf]
(;B[ag]C[(B): this its not a very good endgame move, i suggest you another one. See variation.]

[sd][se][sf][sg][sh][si]C[A very few word on the end:

The game its very interesting, and both can work on the gote no sente strategy (see when you have and dont the initiative).

Try to take the big points first, they give the more territory and can lead to an interesting kind of game.

I hope, that this game could be of any help to both.
