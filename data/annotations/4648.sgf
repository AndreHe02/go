C[Hello. I'm MoonDraGOn (13k KGS). i played black. My opponent has 12k KGS. This game i won, but still i need your advice badly.
Thanks in advance.];B[pd]C[DC: My Name is Dylan Carter, I am 1k UK. I hope my comments help you to understand the process of learning to play a better game.]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[dd]C[DC: the approach move @ P3 is also good as it uses the direction of the star point stone.]
;B[oq];W[qm]C[DC: R10 is more usual for preventing the extension.]
;B[qj]C[DC:This move uses the Q16 stone well and attacks the R7 stone against the shimaru, a good punishment for R7.]
;W[om];B[oj];W[mm];B[jp]C[What about this move? maybe too far from P3? How should i play here?

DC: Looks fine. You are still very open and prone to invasion on the lower side, But since white is only occupying dame points locally I would be happy.]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[lq]C[DC: I would cross cut directly here rather than M4 later.]
;B[np]C[DC: this could strengthen your opponent if they play M4.]

(;W[mo]C[DC: Connecting gives white a better result.];B[no]

;W[dn];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[jc]C[What about my fuseki? I know that it is not finished yet, but further white will make mistake.

DC: If you are so adamant that white is making mistakes then where is the scope for improving your own play by having a review.

Try to find a game where you lost against a stronger opponent and can't understand why, then send it in to GTL. Don't send in a game in the hope a stronger player will just praise your moves.

End of review.];W[nc];B[oc];W[ob]C[hm... this move for W new for me. Right response for me?]
