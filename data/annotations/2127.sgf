C[Hello reviewer, this is yoyoma.
This
game was played with fairly fast time controls, and later in the game it
gets a little sloppy.  But ocho and I were most interested in the first fight of the game, which didn't have too much time problems.
------------------------------------
Hi,

First off, the usual disclaimer.  These are words from a low-kyu/low-dan player, so take them with a grain of salt.

This was an interesting game.  Both sides showed good fighting spirit, but it's a good idea to stop and appraise the situation once in a while.  W had numerous chances to win the game, had he only realized he was leading by a comfortable margin and didn't have to force the issue, particularly in the lower right corner.

As for the first fight, B made a directional error with L4, not quite realizing how thin and vulnerable his own group on the left is.  H12 was a crucial point.  Always beware of your opponent turning the table on you.

Later, B should've grabbed Q10 on the right when his attack on the W group on the left side has achieved its purpose of making it live small.  When it's clear a group you're attacking is clearly alive, you should look up from the fight and look for other, usually much bigger, points to play on other parts of the board.

O12 was too conservative for B.  It only made the game about even, and W had a lot of potential on the right and at bottom, so B O12 surrendered the lead to W.  W got away with E8, but that was partly a result of B's further slow moves in the upper left, after losing the initiative with O12.

Overall, this was a good game for both.  There was no major mistakes (except for W's losing the entire lower right in the end...).  Both players should try to have a better sense of the relative advantage at key moments in the game.  Play accordingly.  If you're leading, there's no need to make unreasonably strong moves.  If you're behind, you cannot afford to make safe, unthreatening moves.

Feel free to let me know if you have more questions.

C[K:  This seems wrong, because it gives B a nice play on the left side.  B gets to make a large extension and a double-wing formation (even though the upper left corner is still open) around D10 or so, and D10 is exactly what W should be aiming for with the C4-E3 corner enclosure.]
;B[dj]C[K: This way, it almost feels as if W lost a move here.]
;W[ie]
(;B[kd]C[K:  G16 would be better.];W[ch]C[K: D12 or E16 might be better for W.]
;B[eh];W[df]
(;B[ec]C[K:  B should definitely E16.  E17 does nothing to put pressure on W.  Alternatively, how about F14?]
;W[ff];B[gh];W[hg]
(;B[kf]C[K:  This is wrong direction.  The focus now is on the left side.  B cannot be expecting turning all of the top right area into territory, since there's still the 3x3 invasion (or other moves in the corner) left for W to play when the chance arises.]

(;W[gf];B[ig];W[hf];B[jg]C[yoyoma [10k\]: i like to fight.  :-)]
;W[bj]C[yoyoma: I had a hard time deciding what black should do next.  I considered:

c8 seals white in (b9 doesn't seem to work)
h10 directly to chase j12/j11 stones

I chose d12 to make a few forcing moves against white to gain strength, and then pressure j12/j11.

K: How about D13 and cut?  Seems to work fine.]
(;B[dh];W[cg];B[ci];W[bi]C[K:  B D12 and C11 help W to work out an almost alive shape.  They are better left unplayed, if B wants to chase the J11 stones anyway.  B's shape still looks awkward though.]
;B[hj]
(;W[hi]C[yoyoma:
If white going to run, I think he should not add this move.  Globally, I
think white should treat j12/j11 lightly.  I was very happy when white started
pushing with this group.

K:  Yes, W makes a mistake here.  With this series of moves, W helps B consolidate the center group while reducing his own group's liberties.]
;B[gi];W[ij];B[hk];W[ik];B[hl];W[il];B[hm]
(;W[jn]C[K: W should probably play toward the right side instead.  K6 is a useful move to get ahead of your opponent in a running battle, but that's not the case here.  B's group on the left is pretty much secure.  So, W should try to develop the right side.]
;B[cl]C[K:  There's no need to play here right now.  W's pretty much alive, and so is B.  Therefore, the biggest point on the board is the right side.]
;W[cj];B[di];W[bl];B[cm];W[pj]C[K: And W grabs it.]
(;B[nj]C[yoyoma:
 This is an attempt to reduce white's moyo, and also looking to make j12
string uncomfortable later.

K:  Be careful though.  B could be the one coming under attack here, since W's J8-12 now looks like a big wall.]

K:  This is partly why I said earlier W's in no real danger]
;W[kl];B[jk];W[kj];B[nh]C[K:  This might be a little conservative.  The game is just about even right now, but W has sente.]

C[yoyoma:  Surely around p9 or something is bigger?

K:  Yes.  Something on the right side or the bottom would be enough to give W the win.  Here, W's playing too hard.  It's kind of an awkward looking but effective sente move though.]
