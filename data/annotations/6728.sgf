;B[pd]C[venkman [?\]: hi, have fun
sushou: hi];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[eq]C[Donal: Up to here, looks pretty good.]
;W[qo]LB[qn:A][qq:B][qk:C][do:D][fp:E]C[Donal: For all I know, a pro might play white 6 here, but I wouldn't want to. It's really hard to get a good result. Black will naturally pinch on the left side, putting White under a lot of pressure and working perfectly with Black's star point at the upper left.

The first move that springs to mind is to play white 6 at A, making B and C miai. Or I might simply play at D, threatening E next.

When I see White 6, my impression is that White is jealous of Black's framework, and begrudges him any of it. It is important to remember that White get's komi, and that has to make up for Black's first move advantage. You can't nullify Black's advantage by brute force.

Or if you are a stone stronger than Black and there is no komi, just relax and wait for him to make a mistake.]
;B[pm]LB[oo:A][np:B][qq:C]C[After Black pinches, White could of course play something ordinary by jumping at A and then attaching at C for example. But this doesn't seem all that good.]
;W[mp]LB[lp:B][lq:A][kp:C][gq:D]C[I looked it up afterwards, and this one doesn't exist - should be A or B apparently.

Donal: "Looking up" such a move is meaningless unless the whole board is the same. This kind of move goes beyond joseki to an analysis of the entire position.

Your idea here is presumably to give up white 6 in return for getting a free move at 8, and then get a powerful pincer against 5. For that purpose white 8 is too far away from black 5. And yet it is too far from white 6 to give you much play in the corner.

If I could pick two consecutive plays on the lower side, they would be at C and D. Only with a powerful attack against black 5 can you make up for the huge loss you incurred with sacrificing white 6.]
;B[po];W[iq]LB[dp:A][gq:B]C[Because white 10 is so far away, Black is able to attach at A. He could not have done this if White had played at B instead of 10 (see diagram).]

(;B[dp];W[co];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[dm]LB[gq:A][br:B]C[In the game, Black gets a comfortable position. A and B are miai. White didn't get enough of an attack to justify his sacrifice of white 6.]
;B[qn]LB[qp:A][pp:B][mr:C]C[Black 17 is an overplay, leaving bad aji in the corner. He should have played at A instead. White can now play A, and if B, C protects White's group in sente (see diagram).]

;B[oe]C[Blocking at black 25 was not that good. White gets a nice corner territory in sente, and if White plays carefully he can erase Black's outside thickness. See the diagram for another option.]
;W[oi]LB[nj:A]C[However, White 36 is too heavy. White quickly gets into trouble. Perhaps a move at A would be better.]
;B[pj];W[oj];B[pk];W[pi];B[lj]LB[mk:A]C[Black has a perfect attack, and it's difficult to find a good move. White A looks like it has possibilities.]
;W[og];B[pf];W[ok];B[mn]LB[ol:A][mk:B]C[Normally, you would expect Black to block at A, but that just propels White to escape at B. Black 45 is an interesting idea.]
;W[mg];B[kq];W[kp];B[lp]TR[mn]LB[lq:A]C[I decided to cut off the marked stone in order to work towards connecting the two groups.  Should I capture the third-line stone instead?

Donal: Yes, that would be better. Since Black has invested an extra stone at 45 before invading, the loss of one white stone is not that big. You could have easily settled your lower-side group.

Also, since Black has good attacking chances against White's two groups, playing Black 49 at A would be better. He can attack the whole group rather than cutting off just part of it.]
;W[lo];B[lq];W[mo];B[jp];W[ko]C[White is in deep trouble with two weak groups.]
;B[jq];W[nn];B[nm];W[mm];B[ml];W[nl];B[lm]LB[om:A]C[Black 59 at 60 would have been even better. Also, 61 at A gives a better attack. Even so, this ko is a big problem for White.]
;W[om];B[on];W[mm];B[do];W[ln]C[I figured that the central thickness was worth more than the ko threat, but a few moves later I wasn't so certain anymore.]
;B[cn];W[bn];B[cm];W[br]LB[bm:A]C[White 70 is no good, because if Black blocks at A, White is dead. To live in the corner, crawl once more at A. But there might be a better way to play here. (See diagram.)]

(;B[bm];W[bo];B[in]LB[jo:A][io:B][mq:C][ip:D][cs:E]C[I felt I had no good points to play after this move.

Donal: Black 73 is an excellent point, and White needs another play to live in the lower left corner. I suggest white A, black B, white C, black D, White E.]

(;W[hc];B[ci];W[dk];B[bs]C[Black missed the killing blow, and let White live.

In this game, White's problems started with white 6. He played a difficult move, and didn't find the best follow-up. Later when Black invaded at 47 he chose a variation that left him without eyes and subject to attack. Finally, with white 70 he made a reading mistake that should have lost him the game on the spot, but his opponent didn't realize it.

Each of these mistakes was probably worth 15 points. So work to avoid them and you will be three stones stronger.

White 6 and the following moves were the main thing, so work on studying the opening.
