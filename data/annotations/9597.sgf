C[Greetings. I am Nico, from Mexico, and I will be reviewing this game.

The review asked about how b got such a big advantage from the fuseki, so I will focus especially hard on trying to answer that. I agree that by move 100 it is clear that black has a significant lead and that white wins only because of a string of black blunders.

Teaching go is a subject that interests me very much. If you have any feedback at all, I would greatly appreciate it if you wrote to me at tuerda@gmail.com

Any questions may also be sent to me there. I will answer them to the best of my ability.




As a side note, I have gotten rid of all the in-game banter. I think it makes the commentary easier to read.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[cp];B[qj]C[This is an unusual pattern. Q10 is far more common. This is perfectly playable, and I have even seen it in pro games, but the reason why Q10 is more common is shown in a variation diagram.]

(;W[jp]C[This is a bit of an unusual spot. See variation diagram.]

(;B[fq]C[The idea of playing inside of white's too long extension is not a bad one, but this move is at pretty much the exact wrong spot (see previous variation diagram for a better choice]
;W[dq]C[When w defends the corner, K4 is exactly where black would like to play next.

The slightly awkward move at K4 has become ideal because of black's move at F3. At this moment white has the initiative.]
;B[lq]C[Black chooses not to defend the F4 stone, and here is where white's moves start to get odd]

(;W[hq]TR[ko]C[The shape of this move is super strange. It seems to be intent on robbing F3 of a base, but actually, as we noted before, the K4 stone was already doing that reasonably well.

Depending on your style, there are several moves worth considering here. Some of them are in the variation diagrams.

Starting right now, L5 (marked) is a splendid move for black. Black does eventually play it, and although his timing was not perfect, the move is really great, and gives b an enormous edge.]
;B[ep]LB[fo:A]C[this is a really weird defense. I do not understand why black does not simply play A.]
;W[dn];B[do];W[co];B[en];W[dm]TR[en][do]C[I do not like the moves at the triangle points by black. They seem to only make the white position more solid.]
;B[em];W[el]LB[fl:A]C[The hane is probably too much.

Since black at A is sente, the two white stones at K4 can come under attack.]
;B[ko]C[Black fights back with a sharp move! This is wher black's right side moyo starts to develop, and it is often a good idea to build influence with knights move attacks like this one. That said, this may also be an overplay. I'm pretty sure black had to  play at F8 first.

See variation diagram for how I think white should handle the situation.]

(;W[hn]C[Running feels OK, but we have to take care because F8 is sente for black.]
;B[gm];W[hm];B[fl]C[when black plays here, the position goes south for white pretty quick.

I would have ignored this move. The price is high, but black at K7 is just too good!]

(;W[ek];B[jm]C[This is another splendid move by black, pressing white while increasing black's influence on a huge scale.

Right about now white is falling behind. Black has engineered a beautiful combination of leaning moves on the left side and enormous influence expanding attacking moves on the right.]
;W[il]C[This is an interesting move. I certainly would not have played it myself, but I am not convinced that anything I can think of is actually any better.]
;B[gj]C[B another good move.];W[jl];B[km]LB[kl:A][ll:B]TR[jm]
C[It is probably better for black to hane at A, or maybe even to fall back to B.

The triangle stone has no intrinsic value, so there is no point in holding on to it like this. It is better for black to keep expanding his moyo.]
;W[ii];B[io];W[ho];B[ip];W[hp];B[gh]C[Starting with L5, black's play has been pretty great.

There is no shame in being beaten by such good moves.

If the 5k is a kgs rank, then it is really quite a feat to play moves like these. I am KGS 1d and I would be pretty proud of myself if I whipped out a combination like this in a game.

The game is not yet lost for white, however.

STOP THE GAME HERE: Whole board tsumego, white to play.

There is really only one move white should even consider at this point, and it is very much not the move that was played. I'm pretty sure any strong player would play this move without even thinking about it.

The solution is in a variation diagram, but I strongly recommend you think about this board position and find the move yourself. I even considered not giving you the solution and making you really suffer, but I have decided against it.

The task is not only to find the move, but to convince yourself that it is obvious.]

(;W[dh]LB[di:A]TR[dl][cn]C[This move is probably where white actually falls behind.

There are many problems with this move. First and foremost, we have to note that white's center group is still dangling. Whatever profit white gets by playing D12 (and we'll get to that in the next paragraph) white will get it in gote. Meanwhile, black can attack white and gain huge profit in sente. Furthermore, this move is very passive: There is no follow up.

Aside from those considerations, there is the question of exactly how much profit this move even makes. What happens, for instance, when black attatches at A? Those triangled cutting points are going to stick out like a sore thumb!

This said, I understand the emotional content here. I can almost hear that voice in your head "Wow, look at that fantastic solid fourth line territory!"

It's a good time to give that voice in your head a stern talking to. The territory is not solid at all, and frankly, it isn't even all that big.]
;B[lk]C[Black takes the key point.];W[kj];B[mi]C[Black completes an absolutely fantastic manoeuver. This is almost literally a textbook attack: There is an extremely similar position in Kato's Attack and Kill.

If I were white, I would consider resigning at this point.]
;W[jd]LB[kh:A]C[I'm not sure what exactly white should do. It seems that black can keep abusing white with a play at A, but to defend at M12 and push black to strengthen his position even more doesn't seem to help.

I guess this move is about as good as any.]
(;B[ch]C[The timing for this move is suspect. It seems like the center is still more important.]
;W[ci];B[di];W[cj];B[dg];W[eh];B[ej];W[dj];B[ei];W[eg];B[fk]
;W[cl];B[de]C[black plays a very interesting move, but I think white might have a chance!]
;W[df];B[cg]
(;W[cf]C[What if white tries the variation?];B[bf];W[ce];B[be]
;W[bd]C[This is an obvious blunder, and pretty much the end of the line.]
;B[ef];W[ee];B[ff]C[At this point black has essentially won.]
;W[hg]
(;B[hh]C[See variation diagram for an interesting move black could play instead of this.]
;W[ih];B[ig]C[After many beautiful attacking moves, black finally goes astray. This cut is completely misguided. White's H13 stone is light and white gets to fix his center group.]
;W[jg];B[if];W[jf];B[ie];W[je]C[White cheers: No more fabulous b attacking moves on the right side.]
;B[ij]C[Not sure what b hopes to get by further fixing white's shape like this.]
;W[jj];B[ik]C[This is even gote for b. His beautiful game begins to get spoiled. In the end black actually remarkably loses.]
;W[kl];B[ll];W[nq]LB[hd:C][id:A][he:B][pq:D]C[I think white should play at A in sente first (or maybe B or C. I was too lazy to try to figure out what exactly was best there)

Also, I think in this sort of situation, white should go directly for the 3-3 point. Otherwise he runs the risk of black playing at D. I would not know how to keep this stone alive if black plays D.]
;B[iq]C[A very strange move. I cannot begin to understand what motivated black to play here. Slowly white begins to crawl back into the game.]
;W[qn]C[Again, really complicated. Why not just invade at R3?]

(;B[rp]C[As black I would be sorely tempted to try to kill white as in the variation.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[mr];B[np]LB[rr:A]C[What if black A instead? (no variations, just a question)]
;W[rq];B[oq];W[or];B[mq];W[nr]C[At this point, please note T3, see variation diagram.]

(;B[hc]C[This move does not work, does it? What if white just cuts?]

(;W[nc]C[White should  first play T4, then cut off H17 as in the variation diagram.]
;B[eb]C[Again, it seems like locally the correct move for white is to cut.]
;W[cb];B[jb];W[fc]C[This move doesn't seem to make very much sense. the E18 stone is not valuable on its own.]
;B[kh];W[jh];B[ki];W[ji];B[lc];W[id]C[Finally white plays this important move.]
;B[he];W[hd];B[ge];W[gd];B[le];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[oc]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[md];W[ib]LB[lf:A]TR[sd][sp]C[Nice tesuji, but poorly timed. This is gote. Right now there are TWO double sente moves (triangled) and also some pretty absolute  normal-sente moves, like A.]
;B[ic];W[kb];B[jc];W[nd];B[ne];W[kc]
(;B[kd]LB[dh:B][hq:A]C[Black missed a tesuji, see variation diagram.

Anyways, I think I have said all the important things I have to say about this game. There are one or two minor details about endgame technique (like how ridiculously  long those double sente points stayed on the board) and of course black's final game-losing blunder.

Either way I think this was a very interesting game. You were correct in noting that the opening is the most interesting place, and in particular, it is a situation that went sour for one very clear reason, so hopefully this game will be very instructive.

The two main mistakes that made white fall so far behind were A and B, but it is really worth noting just how well black took advantage of these errors.

This is an important piece of endgame technique. Double sente moves wait for nobody! The moment you are sure that your opponent will answer is the moment you play them.]

As a side note, in this position it is about to be abundantly clear that this move is very good, but one thing worth noting is that even if there weren't such a strong continuation, this is still the kind of move you absolutely want to play.

I think many players might omit this move and try to take the corner points at square, but it is not a good idea. White has to use the cutting stones to fight, so he is in no position to allow them to be weakened.]

(;W[dn]LB[gp:A]C[This move is a little bit slow, but if black ignores white will play A.

This is a territory-oriented move  for when you don't mind giving black the first move in the fight on the bottom side. The added strength that this move gives the white stones will help.

You can also even consider this an indirect attack. Remember: If white is strong, that means black is weak.

This move is not exactly my style, but I think it would work.]

(;W[jn]LB[ko:A]C[Another move I would consider is this one. It is a nice, easygoing approach. This defends the white stone and  keeps white's options open, not commiting to anything quite yet.

A is similar, and might even be better. I am not sure.
