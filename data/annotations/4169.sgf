Thank you in advance, dear reviewer, for helping me to improve my game.

I'm a go newbie who has been playing two or three games a day on IGS for the past month.  I've grown to the point that I'm not making two tragic plays per game, and I'm starting to consistently face players who also don't do that, so I have to play a solid game and not just an error-free one.

I'm looking for an evaluation of my basic strategy.  Am I missing the big points, or am I rushing out to new territory so quickly that I'm leaving the last conquest undefended?  There are some specific parts that I'll bring up, but I'm almost more interested in the plays that I didn't think to consider.

The other major question is on my leaping into the center to create territory there.  First, am I missing easier opportunities to make points on the sides?  Second, is my leaping too slow, too reckless, or well-paced?  The third question is whether I should leap in parallel on both sides of the board, but I can't think of a clear way to ask now so we'll just wait until we hit it in the game.


Hi, I'm Tom, I'll review your game.  First Let me say I'm about 15 kyu, so my analysis is by no means the final word.  I played out as many variations as I could in the hope that they'd be helpful to you, but the best thing you can do with this and all your games is play through your own variations, and try to convince yourself of anything about which you're unclear.  

An evaluation of your basic strategy: the two big things I can tell you are don't play to the center and try early on to attack and kill his groups.  Making center territory is generally ineffective and dangerous; don't think about it until all the attacks on the corners and sides have been played out.  Second, playing a little more aggressively, especially attempting to split his stones up, would help your game considerably.
In general your game was good, keep playing, and if you have any questions email me at thn@mail.utexas.edu.

enjoy!];W[pp];B[dd];W[nc];B[qf];W[fc];B[ec]C[note: better at e18

/* bug doesn't think so */];W[jd]C[Can I stop this from happening?  Or do I have to allow it and then invade later?

allow it, and then invade now!]
(;B[ed]C[not necessary, lets white cover the hole.  play h17 or h18. This is a blocky structure; in general avoid making this 3 stone clump.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[cf];B[ce]C[Again, b15 probably a little better.]
;W[dj]C[now a direct follow up at c12 is best.  contact play on a safe structure is bad, as a general rule.  you should punish white's mistake.]

(;B[jq];W[ph];B[mp];W[ql];B[rh]C[this is ok, but if you want to attack this side, a split would be better, something like r6, r10, even p3.]

(;W[of]C[see variations for better plays for white; this might help understand where your weaknesses are.]
;B[pc];W[qe];B[pe];W[re];B[rf];W[pf];B[rd]C[This seems like a sensible initial move, which will keep him mostly still.]
;W[qg];B[rg]C[I think this settles the corner in my favor.

Right.  This sequence is very bad for white. see previous variations for possible better plays.]
;W[qh];B[hc]C[Here's my first attempt at invading his wide moyo.

Yes, this is an important play, probably should have been earlier.  you have good opportunity also on the left side top.]
;W[gd];B[jc];W[kc];B[ic];W[id];B[fb];W[hd];B[gc];W[fd]C[I can't be dissatisfied with this result.  He's got a nice wall but no base.

Yes, he's lost most of his points.  right now there are 3 key areas for play: most important is the vicinity of d13; an invasion anywhere along there is excellent.  second is b4, which secures territory and sets up for an attack on the c6 stone; third is the Q4 stone, which could be attacked on either side.]
;B[nn]C[A move like this is too small, given the uncertainty of gain in this area.  you invite white to play Q6 and solidify this side.  Don't play to the center.]
;W[ol];B[pn];W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[pl];W[qj];B[ch]C[good.];W[pk]
C[Now that I see his stone there, I wish it were mine.

No, c12 was bigger, and leaving it unanswered (called tennuki in japanese) is a mistake for white.]
;B[eh]C[now his wall up top gives him no points.  From here on out, you've won the game.]
;W[df];B[cj]C[Is this good shape?  It seems like I might be in some trouble if he played D11.

b10 is safer.  I show an alternate variation with white playing d11.]

(;W[ck];B[ci];W[ff];B[bf];W[po];B[oo];W[oq]C[In response to your later question about invasion, his moyo is pretty safe after this play.  to live inside now would be difficult.  This is the disadvantage to your move at O6.  Now of those three key areas I mentioned earlier, two have been settled: the left side gave black strong advantage, but the bottom right corner was given to white. this just leaves the bottom left.  can you see how white's stones on that side are weak now?]
;B[ml]C[I was struggling for the right combination of moves here.  I wanted to start to expand to cover some center territory but was unsure of the best way to proceed.

In general, the best defense is a good offense. this move is gote, which means white gets a free play.  Again, don't play to the center.  If you want to build a strong moyo in this area, start by pressuring around e6.]
;W[mq];B[lq];W[nq];B[mj]MA[el][en]C[This is another question that I have about defining center territory. Here, I'm working my way around in a circle, and I'm not sure if it would be better to make jumps on the left side to balance my progress on the right side.    (I think maybe this is what "The Second Book of Go" would call "making a box shape".)  Specifically, in this instance, would I be making better territory if I made E6 and E8  before focusing on N10?

e6 and e8 are bigger, but the reason may not be what you think.   he does not have good shape on the left at all. a play at e8 threatens to cut at d9, and then you can probably have e6 for free.  these are good sente plays.]
;W[fh];B[ei]C[not necessary, play elsewhere];W[fj];B[ok]MA[mj]
[ml]C[This was an unpleasant move.  I thought it was a good extension from the two stones to the left, but it really just forced him to strengthen his position.  Would P10 or P11 have been better moves?

No.  If he's going to build territory at all, it will be in top center, especially after his last two moves. your wall is pretty safe; you can extend into k12 or so any time you wish.]

(;W[om];B[on];W[oj];B[nk];W[nh];B[lh]C[I need to pull back a row, giving him nice eyespace.

i don't think you could have disconnected his groups.];W[mo]

(;B[mn]C[This seems like a good attack, and I can't quite come up with a good response.  I'd have played M4 if I was confident he'd respond with O4, but I feared that he'd reply with this point instead.

my instinct tells me here to make the cut at o4 and make him fight to live.  it's certainly not a guarantee, but it looks ok.  This is why it is dangerous to make points in the center.]
;W[lp];B[lo];W[kp];B[ko]
(;W[np]C[white could easily have kept going-- see variations]
;B[jp];W[kq]C[Could I have done better than this?

As i said previously, i would have blocked the connection and tried to kill.  You were lucky that white stopped where she did.]
;B[bk]MA[ln][jo]C[I can't think of a good way to defend both of the cutting points in the new boundary.  L6 seems possible but I'm not in love with it.  So I decided to attack in hopes that inspiration would come to me as things solidified elsewhere.

neither is a big threat. better to play on your left side; it's more aggressive.]
;W[cl];B[lf]C[this is good, it hurts his main moyo.];W[jf];B[ji]
LB[kg:B][jh:A]C[Again, I'd play A but I'm afraid that he would cut one of the links with B.

your play is fine.  Notice now how damaging white h8 could be to your moyo though.  Also around this time you should start thinking about b4.]

(;W[ne];B[hi];W[fi];B[hk];W[fl];B[hm]MA[ln][jo]C[Having played these last two stones, L6 is now a good way to defend both of my cutting points.  Should I take a move to play it, or is my position now strong enough that I wouldn't need it?

your last two moves were good.  I don't think you have to worry about the cut.]
;W[bl];B[aj];W[cp]C[these two white moves transitioned white from having nothing to having 10 points.]
;B[cq];W[co];B[do];W[dn];B[en];W[er]C[too little, too late.]

(;W[hb]C[I've got my hands full enough figuring out my own play, but what would you think of him playing E18 instead?  Seems like I'd have been in some real trouble.

You would have to try to escape to the other side.  tricky, but it can be done, i think.  see variation]
;B[ha];W[ri];B[ld];W[kd]MA[ld]C[
This looks like some trouble for M16, so I'm secretly deciding that it's not all that important to my plans and I'll let him steal it from me when the time comes.]
;B[qq]C[I don't know if this is overdue or silly.  It just strikes me that I will either die without losing points (being completely inside his moyo) and retaining sente or I will live and take most of his largest moyo.  I can't see myself regretting either outcome.

It's good to take chances.  just play carefully.  I put down a few variations, but the possibilities are limitless.]

It is a ko after white T2, but if he had played the best result, you would have died.  see variations.]

(;B[db]LB[sa:B][db:A]C[Do you think this was necessary?  I'm not one to fill in my own points without reason, but I was nervous that he'd try to invade my corner starting from E18.

it would have looked a lot like your invasion on the opposite corner, don't you think?]

Not necessary.];W[oi];B[ge]C[Was this too small to bother with?  I sure didn't defend this stone when the time came, so perhaps it would have been better if I hadn't played it at all.
