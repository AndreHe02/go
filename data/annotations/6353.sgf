C[This game was against a 23k opponnent on the Oro Baduk server. I am 24k on this server. I felt I was playing well until the late-mid game when a large group got cut-off in the lower-middle area. I thought I was connecting well, but realized too late that I wasn't. I completely fell apart and resigned near the end-game after a terrible mistake on my part. Any tips would be appreciated! I felt I played the opening well.

Hi,
My name is TheBeast (Nilsen from "GD.com")  And I will try to review this game best as possible.

Okey, this was a fun game, you did not loose to a mistake, since you was way behind.
If there is something I have forgot to tell you ask me on either my hotmail or my accont on GD.com

I think your main problem now is to see if a group is weak or not, and you leave the groups without protecting them or punish the other players mistakes.]

[eq:B]C[Now you have made something simular the kick, and this sould be a good exchange for Black.
Why the kick is good for black is since it is no stone arond (A), and white still needs to protect a weakness at (B)]
;W[gq]LB[eq:A]C[White did not protect the weakness at (A)

See examples]
(;B[oq]LB[cj:C][dj:B][eq:A]C[Wrong, this is a big point,
  you sould attack the weakness at (A) or extend at (B-C),  I would extend to (B-C) before attacking the weakness]
;W[dj]LB[dj:A][oq:B]C[I felt I was playing wel up to this point. I planned to break up his right side with my next move.

i.), Now there is no right side.
ii.) You sould extended at (A) insted of (B), then it would be even.]
;B[dg];W[qe]LB[nd:B][pd:A]C[I answer his approach with O17, per my readings in Learn to Play Go Vol.II.

i.) I have not read the Learn to Play Go Vol.II]
(;B[nc]LB[nd:B][pd:A]C[I dont think this is the best way to answer his attack.
If your stones was at (A) & (B) it would been good.
---
See example how I would played this out.];W[lc]C[I felt I had enough room to live in the upper-right, so I went to make sure I had enough on the left. I think I should have played near the lower-middle or right-hand star points instead, or F16 or C17 in order to break up his area more.
***
You have no problem living at this points, because you can very easy escape.]
;B[ci]LB[gd:E][ne:A][qg:B][eq:C][iq:D]TR[cn][dn][do]C[This is a bad move.
With this move you help white make a wall against your marked stones.

[fd:A][gd:B]C[This leads to a massive upper territory on his part later on.
***
That is not sure at this point, you can still invade at (A-D)]
;B[cj]C[I still think you sould done one of the moves that I showed in #Move17.
   But this move is okey, if you want to play passive.  Now white cant cut your stones.

See example why]

;B[qh]LB[qg:A]TR[qe]C[Trying to break him up so he doesn't claim the whole right side.

C[Invading, finally.

This is wrong, Sure, you get the corner.
But white have marked a to big upper left side moyo.
And you cant let him make a great wall there.
(A-B) would cut (1-2) connection.

You can still escape at (A), and after the escape is done you can cut at (B)]

i.) You are far from okey : |
ii.) You have to escape];W[rh]
