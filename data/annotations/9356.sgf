C[Hello,

I'm Julien, 3k in France and 2k on KGS. I hope this review will be useful for you. Please ask additional questions, if any.

Some overall comments: you've made some errors in the opening and so you was behind at the beginning of the shuban. Then you attack the unsettled white group too frontly. As a consequence, it becomes much stronger and you got weak groups in the process. You have to be more patient. For instance, you could have reducing the white moyo first to get power, then got points while attacking.

Also you have sometimes problems with your shape: good shapes make your stone stronger and remove defects.

Hope this helps,

I don't think so. White overplayed a bit here and you punish him. Thanks to this move, white has no more a moyo on the right.]

(;B[ip]C[Usually you don't have to save a single stone (except if it cuts white into 2 groups).]
;W[jm];B[gp];W[ho];B[hp];W[cq];B[cp]TR[cf]C[I think not blocking the other way at D3  was my first major mistake.

True, blocking the other way is better. You have no extension on the left and C14 made the right side almost pointless.]

[ql][rl][sl][qm][rm][sm][ar][cr][as][bs][cs]C[What should I have done from here?

Not that easy. I count 36 pts for black and 45 pts + komi for white. So white is leading. That is because you've done some mistakes in the opening. That is still playable for black but difficult.

You have some potential on the left, while white have potential on the right. Also the only weak group is white K5 but it is not so weak right now. So it would be bad to attack it frontly.

Maybe you could play F2 in sente. Next, white has still potential on the right. So you could reduce it while weakening the K5 stones.]

(;B[kl]C[I wasn't sure whether to play this or M8.

When the opponent stones are not very weak, you usually don't attack them frontly because you only help him to definitively settle its stones...]

(;B[fl]TR[dj][dn]SQ[kk][kl][km]C[My goal here was to isolate F10 and also prepare to capture H5 and F6 after a push and atari at J5 and H6. Unfortunately it didn't work out and being forced to defend F8 was probably what lost me the game.

You're objective is to make points (by attacking). Isolating F10 does nothing. Actually, it is a light stone that white would be ok to sacrifice. It is only here to help white if required. Even capturing the H5/F6 stones would not be big: it would be around 10-15 points but it would take you several moves (at least 3 or 4). With 3-4 moves you (and white) could do much better.

Also the shape of F8 with D10 and D6 is bad and you have a problem with the L9 shape (see variation).]

Yes too agressive. Be patient. You have too weak groups now while white has only one between yours. A "weak" group between 2 other weak groups is actually strong.]
