C[G : Hello. I am Giroro on kgs. I annotated my comments with a "G". I played this game with black. I think i made some weird choices in the fuseki, but I have some difficulty to pinpoint the mistakes. I would appreciate any comments on that, also on how to conduct better the main attack of the game.
Any other advice is great too, of course.
Thanks for  your time.

C: Hi!. I앐 AWas in KGS. Liked the way you played most of the game. The problem was you lost the four corners and didnt have much territory at all. Finally played a good yose and took the game in the final stage.

I enjoyed watching the game and hope my comments can help you. The main fight of the game was well played, you didnt try to kill, and got some profit out of it. Any doubt feel free to email me. 

Bye!.];B[qd];W[pp];B[dd];W[od];B[pf];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc]LB[re:a]
[rb:b]C[C: This are the two posible joseki. There are two thins to consider:

a is sente. Black plays a white play in the upper side, then black takes the corner. 

b is gote it압 a more territorial move. I앏l add the variation of this joseki.]

(;B[qe]C[C: This is the First "strange move". Not being joseki make it dubious.

S18 becomes a big endgame move for white.

Also you need to play around r10 taking into consideration that it is too good for white to make a pincer there and extend from his hoshi stone.

Thats why I would have played S15 ("a" in last diagram to end up in sente here.)]
;W[jc];B[dp]C[G : I hesitated to play R10, but the prospect of playing first in three corners was too beautiful to my eyes...]
;W[qj]C[G : and this was unpleasant.];B[qb]C[G : i didn't want to play something like R12 right away, because that would give W the opportunity to answer with R7, which would be big.

C: The problem is that something like r12 or s 13 would be good for white. My point of view is that:

1- You played tenuki and got the big point of d4, then r 12 is playable.

2- White has the opportunity of playing q18. Since white is over extended k17 is better in l17, you should not help reinforce this side.]
;W[pb];B[dj]C[G : S18 would be better i think, to stabilize the upper right group.

C: Here I see something rare. Because:

R18 didnt help to get two eyes, and it reinforced white where he was overextended. Now white reinforced his position on the top. That is why i would have played r12.]
;W[jq];B[qh]C[C: Finally you played r12!!.  So the exchange r18 for q18 is completely bad for black.]
;W[fq]C[C: White p10 building up a moyo would have been better.]
;B[qn]C[G : would R7 be a better way to attack R10? SHould I play elsewhere? Invade the sansan?

C: good direction of play here. You have to reduce the moyo. How? wish i know that. I can give some clues:

1- Your move here is better than sansan (from my point of view), because it has the support of a strong group in r12.

2- playing r7 can give white a really big corner territory. And although attacks r 10 it isn앖 very severe so:

- to reduce r6 is fine.
- to attack i would have played r8.

I would have chosen your move.];W[qo];B[pn];W[ro];B[pj]C[G: Basically here I decided to trade 2nd-3rd lines territory with influence. I believe it turned out pretty well for me.]

(;W[qm]C[C: rare move from white.];B[pm];W[rm];B[qk]C[C: This is a very important point.]
;W[rk];B[qi];W[rj];B[jo]C[C: Black is playin this part of the game with rythm. The result is good for black.

- You entered a moyo, buildin up a wall and making white play 2nd line. Then reduce white압 prospects of buildin something big below.]
;W[cn]C[G : how to respond this? separate at E5?]
(;B[fp]C[C: This move reinforces whites stronger side, so its the right direction. To attack his weaker side.

The prolem of choosing this joseky here is that white already played two vital point of the joseky (K3 and c6).

So i would have played e5. As in the variation.];W[gp];B[fo]
;W[eq];B[do]C[C: This is not very good for black. You youls have liked to play d3.]
;W[cr];B[dq];W[dr];B[go];W[bp];B[dn];W[cm];B[hp];W[gq]
(;B[ld]C[G : right after playing it, I wondered if the shoulder it would have been better...

C: Difficult for me to say that. This move looks ok.];W[rb]
C[C: This is too defensive for white.];B[gc];W[cf];B[df];W[ce]
;B[de];W[bc];B[cd];W[bd];B[cg];W[db]
(;B[lc]C[G : now i start the massive attack. But i am not sure that just playing K16 wouldn't have been better.

C: There압 a rule that says "atach reinforces both sides". If youre strong you dont need to reinforce yourself. So dont hel your opponent reinforce his weak positions. 

I am a Thickness oriented player. I  like the boshi here (k15)

But k 16 is also godd here since as you showed in your sequences helps black make something real big in the center.

The problem is that youre breaking a proverb which is: "DONT MAKE TERRITORY WITH THICKNESS". But then Tekemiya Masaki would say this proverb is incorrect.

The problem here is... Black has no territory. White has 4 corners. so black must have something in his mind for the rest of the game. And center territory is the only thing he can really expect to win.]
;W[je];B[lf];W[jg];B[lh];W[ge]C[C: Difficult fight here.  For both. Is difficult for black to choose a target so as to focus the attack on:

building thickness (you dont need it.

buildin territory (seems only hope)

make an attack on one group and build something on other part f the board.]

(;B[id];W[ic];B[hd];W[jd];B[ec];W[ji];B[hg];W[ig];B[hf];W[he]
;B[ie];W[if]C[C: Good cut... First point of territory are apperaing for black.]
;B[hh];W[kf];B[kg]C[C: This move helps white. i would have played m10.]
;W[kh];B[lg];W[li]C[C: M11 too godd for white to be true.];B[ih]

;B[fb];W[hb];B[kb];W[jb];B[mq]C[G : I felt this was the last very big point. Any other possible moves?

C. Like this one. b 13 is somthing to consider. Probably first b13 then here.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[oq];B[mr];W[nr];B[lp]
(;W[pk];B[ok];W[pl];B[ol];W[ql];B[bg]C[C: Good (didnt see you played here befor making last comment). White압 secuence was bad since it made only 5 points taking r9 and reducing black in 3 point but this in gote.]
;W[be];B[hq]C[C: H3 combined with n2 is terrible for white...Probably white should have played the secuence i showed in the upper left then.. com here and play h3.

Now black is turning the result on his favor. Think Q9 is white압 loosing move. See black played:

N3; P13 and H3...the 3 biggest yose point in the game. White took a small point with q9]
;W[hr];B[ir];W[gr];B[iq];W[eb];B[bk];W[ck];B[cj];W[bl];B[dk]
;W[cl];B[bj];W[rd]C[C: Black territory getting bigger each move...]
;B[re];W[sc];B[cb];W[cc];B[dc];W[fa];B[fc];W[bb];B[ne]C[G : hesitated with G8 or H8.

C. G or the one played in the game both look fine.think they are more or less same value. Perhaps G8 1 or 2 points bigger.
