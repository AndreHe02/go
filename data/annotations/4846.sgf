Hi,
  I got crushed pretty badly this game and wanted to see what kind of 
feedback I could get on it.  I'm suspecting that my handling of the lower 
side (and eventual invasion of the right side) led to most of my problems.
/JJH

Hello,

Let's see if I can advise you

Is this where I went wrong?  I'm pretty sure that I've heard someone say 
that it can be best to not try and save H3.  Maybe that's just when the 
pincer is a bit wider?  I've seen joseki with white J3 here instead of what 
I played.  I'd like to know if my play (or what follows) was good or bad.
/JJH

This is indeed a mistake. You let Black cut you, which is almost always bad]
;B[iq]C[Naturally, Black cut with sente];W[ir];B[jr];W[kr];B[hr]
;W[js]C[JJH:
I was thinking a ponuki was good and that I could attack the right corner in 
sente.  After seeing how this turned out, I don't really think that was the 
right way to think about the situation.
/JJH


White is still sente. You don't have to play  on this side, because Black 
can not kill your group for the moment.];B[hp];W[nq]C[White should play elsewhere, O3 is too small.]

right side. Why not a move such as R11 instead ?];B[pf];W[jd]

What's the best way to handle this invasion?  Was K16 too far away?  Did I 
respond to the corner invasion poorly?
/JJH


No, K16 is OK. Usually, Black would play at K17 instead of M17, and then 
strenghten his corner. M17 comes after.

Personally, I would have tried to play the corner.]

How best to handle this invasion?  Maybe N2 or does that leave white too 
weak?

(;W[ql]C[JJH:
From here on out, the game seems to revolve around this invasion.  It 
spoiled way less area than I expected and I gave up too much in exchange for 
trying to make life.  Any tips on how to do a better invasion or trimming 
alternatives are welcome.
