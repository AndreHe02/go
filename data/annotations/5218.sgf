C[Hi, I´m playing W in this game. Since my fuseki isn´t good I´d like to receive some tips. In my endgame play were also many weaknesses, in particular when my bottom left group was cut off, I played some moves that turned out not to be good. (Excuse my bad English ^_^)
Thanks in advace

M: Hi, thanks for letting me review your game. I hope what I say is helpful to you. I'll be putting a "M" in front of my comments.]

(;B[dp]LB[pd:A]C[M: Normally, black would play the marked stone at Q16 (A).]
;W[pd];B[qj]C[what would be a good answer here?]
(;W[fd]C[M: Certainly, white had the right idea with attacking the corner here, but white would have started a more severe attack if they just played one point closer, at E16 (A) or E17 (B).]
;B[ec]LB[fd:A]TR[cd]C[here, too: what is a better point?

M: This is quite a difficult situation. The moves at E16 or E17 that I mentioned before would have stopped this happening, but because black was able to complete the corner shape (marked), black is very happy. Black has several options here, all good, depending on how white answers. The lone white stone at F16 (A), in contrast, is looking weak.]

(;B[fq];W[bp]C[this one should be c10? then later b4?

LB[qc:A]C[M: This move is rather harsh on white. The normal move, R17 (A) is no longer a good move. The R17 move is designed to stop the other player from gaining as much of the corner as they would otherwise.

M: However, in this situation, it's better to just extend, and let black take the corner.]

(;W[qe]C[M: Black isn't able to be cut here, so white shouldn't try. This move simply strengthens black for no white gain. It's commonly known as "false sente". 

M: Instead, white should look for what else they can do in this area. There are some suggestions in the variation.]
