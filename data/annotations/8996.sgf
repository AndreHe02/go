Hi Christoph, I'm Greg. Feel free to email me at gtc.cole@gmail.com if you have any more questions. All my comments are in the game.]

;B[np];W[no];B[mo];W[oo]TR[lp]SQ[dp]C[After W P5, it's best for black to jump into the corner right away. Playing at M4 (triangle) can be okay if D4 (square) was a black stone, but trying to make influence in the middle of the opponent's stones doesn't usually do much good.]
(;B[lp];W[pm];B[fq]C[This is the point where I don't like black too much. White had a nice sequence here, but I think the move he played in the game was a mistake. See variation.]
(;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[fn]C[After this I think black is in the lead.]
(;W[qf]
(;B[od]C[This move makes O17 look a little funny. The shape is off. See variation.]
;W[of];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[po];B[rm];W[or]
(;B[rk]C[This move is too small at the moment. White urgently needs a move on the bottom left, so he ha no time to fix around R9. However, you could have the chance to deny him that move. See variation.]
;W[rj];B[ql];W[pk];B[pl];W[ol]C[I would still tenuki here.]
(;B[pn];W[om];B[mm]TR[pk][qk][ol][om]SQ[mk]C[Thsi is good, and it is a vital point, but it would be better to play this before the S9 exchanges. Because of the triangled stones, the move at N9 (square) becomes a lot more effective.]
;W[mk];B[nr];W[qr];B[rr];W[rs];B[rq];W[qm];B[rl];W[ck]C[White got the urgent point now.]
(;B[mf]TR[lk][mk][ll][ml][lm][mm]C[I don't really like this move a lot. It is pretty much completely cut off after O15. Thus, instead of a reduction, it is a liability (and it does become a problem later). It would be better to not play anything there for the moment. It is important to figure out where the black and white moyos both connect, which is around the triangled area, so that's where you can expand yours and shrink your opponent's.]
;W[ne];B[ri];W[qj];B[pg];W[pf]
(;B[hd]C[This move I don't really like at all. Black already has a territorial lead, so you can play safely and just win the game. This move seems to say that you want the center and influence. However, there is not much to earn. We can go back to the moyos at the bottom and the right again. M9 still looks vital to me.]

At this point I still feel like you are leading, but I feel like white is catching up. The fighting on the left looks like it is going to get complicated. I can't really tell if the sacrifice was good, but it looked necessary. Also your stones are not 100% dead on the left.

However, I don't think you needed to make this a complicated game. I think just expanding your moyo comfortably at the bottom would lead to an easier win.

You also missed the big opportunity at C8 earlier in the game to take a very big lead in the opening.]

(;B[mm]C[This is also thinkable now. If white plays C9, you can easily expand your moyo even more. You corner is not at all in danger right now.]

(;B[oe]C[This shape is a little better I think. The corner is slightly weaker, but it has more effect on the right side. Giving white P14 is fine. See continuation.]
