 jorgeant 12k*: have a nice game

black: hi, i won this game because there wasn´t proper komi so i´m not very proud of if, but anyway, my problems i think has been leaving a group, not been able to kill two groups and one "miracle", i would like your advice in all that (well, except with the miracle ...) and of course in all other issues you want, thanks in advance

Hi, my name is Fletcher, Kodiak on nngs, and here's what I think of your game...]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[ic]C[I'd much rather play as in the variation.  It keeps things simpler.]

(;B[fe]C[There is nothing wrong with this, though.];W[cg];B[mc]
LB[kc:a][lc:b]C[This should be at 'a', I feel.  'b' is good too, but this isn't severe enough.]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[lc]C[See, this is the problem with your pincer.  White has too much space to manuver, and your three stones on the left are looking very weak all of the sudden.]
;B[ld];W[kd];B[le]LB[lb:a]C[Get the extra profit out of your stones and atari at 'a' first.]
;W[lb]
(;B[pj]C[black: i really wanted to play there 17, so much that i refused to play it at n18, good election?

This is an allright move, but not the best.
Variation 2 is what I feel would happen if you play N18.
Variation 3 is what I think you should play.];W[qf]
(;B[qh]C[black: good direction?

See the variation.  This is strong, but in your sphere of influence you should attack.]
;W[of]C[White should take the corner with the 3-3 point.];B[qd]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[mg]
(;B[ne]LB[ke:a]C[at 'a'.  Look at the variation.];W[oh];B[db]
LB[dc:a]C[To settle play the contact play of 'a', as a general rule.]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[dc];W[cd];B[cn]LB[fq:a]C[play at 'a' and build a moyo.]
;W[cl]LB[cq:a][fq:b]C[now you have to play at 'a'.  Your only other option is 'b', and I will show you the joseki for that in a variation.]

(;B[en]C[not a move here.];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[bq]LB[cj:a]C[instead of playing here, you have to pincer at 'a'.  It's the law.]
;W[dj];B[hq]LB[mb:a][ke:b][lf:c][mi:d][kg:e]C[black: until now i was quite happy, but i wasn´t convinced about this strange 41, perhaps better a simple c2?   You should still be attacking the right-side white group if you ask me.  Black a, W b, B c is a territory oriented way of doing it, and B d W e B b is a more severe method.  I would play this.
But as far as the bottom is concerned, what is your plan with this move?  Your group on the left is weak, so you cannot attack severely.  Taking territory on the bottom is good, but dangerous.]
;W[ho];B[kp]LB[jp:a]C[This is thin.  'a' is better locally.]
;W[br];B[fr];W[er];B[cp];W[dr];B[fq];W[eq];B[qn]LB[bl:a][dl:b]
C[You have to defend the left.  'a' or 'b' is reasonable.];W[do]
;B[dn];W[co];B[bo];W[bm]C[black: of course, i have been too greedy and now and entire group is in darger, i thought that defend it would be painfull and useless so i took a very hard decision, to give up the entire group

I understand your plan to sacrifice these stones, but you do so too early.  you must at least connect.  If these stones are separated they lose any aji, and that is terrible.  Even if you give them up you must use them; make peeps and ko threats and such.]
;B[go];W[fo];B[gp];W[fn];B[gn];W[fm];B[gm];W[nq]C[black: now i go to kill, nothing less

See, you have left yourself with no options.  That is a very risky thing to do.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[lq];W[nn];B[nj]LB[mi:a]C[black: here my aim was killing, and in my very modest knoledge is that is better a distant attack, but perhaps this is too distant ...

Think of 'a', whick attacks two groups at once.];W[nl];B[lk]
;W[pl];B[om]C[black: now i wasn´t sure about killing everything, so ...]
;W[nm];B[ol];W[ok];B[nk];W[pk];B[pm];W[oj];B[oi];W[ni];B[qk]
;W[km]
(;B[ll]C[black: from here and for some movements i was in the mistake that the 69-71 group will have to escape

That is a rough mistake, but look at the variation for a lesson in attacking.]
;W[lm];B[il];W[lo];B[mo];W[mp];B[mn];W[jl];B[jk];W[op];B[pq]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[ko];B[jo];W[jn];B[io];W[kl];B[ln];W[kk];B[mi]
C[black: me trying to escape :-) disgusted for letting the white dragon alive and thinking that i am down in the game (it´s imposible for me to count meanwhile playing)

Desperate or not, this atari is important because it reduces the eye space of the above stones.]
;W[nh];B[li];W[kj];B[ki];W[jj]
(;B[kn]LB[lg:a]C[rev: misread

Yes, and a very big one.  Before this you could still attack the white group, but now it has all the eye space it needs.
Look at variation 2 & 3 for the what could happen after black 'a']
;W[lp];B[kq];W[qg];B[rh];W[kg];B[jh]C[black: me continuing escaping 8...-D]
;W[ik];B[lg]C[black: just desperated];W[lf];B[lh];W[mf];B[kf]
;W[ke];B[jf]C[black: how curious is mental procesing, just thinking i´m alive just seen i was never in danger ...]
;W[oe];B[od];W[rg];B[ql];W[re];B[rd];W[sf]C[Seriously, that white group should have been dead.]
;B[mb];W[jc]
(;B[ja]C[black: again trying to kill as my only hope

See the variation.  When attacking, it's better not to hope to kill, but to reduce the eye space, and get real profit in sente.   Usually it makes for a more effetive attack, too.]
;W[ka];B[hb];W[ia];B[hc];W[ib];B[jd];W[je];B[id];W[ie];B[hd]
;W[he];B[kc]LB[gf:a]C[Why here?  There is no way he can make too eyes inside.  Play a move like 'a' to shut him in and kill!]
;W[gf];B[ig]C[black: from here i was absolutaly desperated, playing in a kind of way absolutaly strange for me, always overplaying (i was thinking) but perhaps white was then too conservative, so i can´t understand how but i won]

black: well, that´s all, thanks for sharing your time with me ;-)

No problem.  Your game was pretty solid overall;  Just a few mistakes that mess up your game.  Keep up the good work!]

The thing is, in your actual game, you had a good chance of killing him, but in general this is the 'better' way to go about attacking, for even if you don't succeed in killing, you have made a profit.]

It is a long range idea, but notice that white can't attack your three stones now, because he has too much to worry about.]

(;B[mb]C[Just block, and white still has to worry about making life.]
