C[This was one I played (as black) on the Dragon turn-based Go server. I made several blunders in the beginning, and learned a few techniques along the way. I'm interested in exploring why I lost this one, particularly because in a game I was playing simultaneously against the same player, in which I was white, I won by 70 points.]
;B[qd];W[pd]C[I was surprised by this immediate attachment. I thought what I should do was try to stake out territory in the corner, since that's what my first move was about.


This first move of white is really strange and normally not played because of 2 things:
1: Always try to make territory / influence bevor attacking
2.Never lay a stone next to one of your opponent in the beginning because it makes him stronger]
;B[pc];W[od];B[pg];W[oc];B[pb];W[ob];B[oa]C[p 19 is too small. It is a move, that you play in the endgame. Probably something like r15 is better cause it saves the corner better.]
;W[na];B[pa];W[mb]C[Now white's built up a strong wall already, and I'm restricted to the corner.

white has a wall but you have a the corner and the corner is not small.I would say both have profitted]
;B[pe]C[I'm thinking that I want to support my existing territory. But would one of the other corner star points have been bigger?

The idea is ok but with q15 you have there 3 cuts that could make you problems so r15 might be safer.]
;W[oe];B[of]MA[qd][pe][of]C[This was a mistake: I'm finding that the diagonal triple like black R16, Q15, P14, is usually very weak.

In this situation hane wasn't good because you have now too much cuts that make your group very weak. q14 would be safer.]
;W[qe]MA[pe]C[Now I'm worried about "my" corner, so I think I'll sacrifice Q15 to secure the corner.

yes the right idea. To loose the corner would be too big.];B[rc]
TR[pb][pc][rc][qd]C[But this move just extended the diagonal, so now I'm vulnerable again

no it is okay here. this form is very strong.];W[rd];B[qc];W[pf]
;B[re];W[qf];B[rf]C[s14 is very small. You should play tenuki or strong the two stones at p14/q13 with maybe p13.]
;W[qg];B[rg];W[og];B[ph]C[I have to choose where to go. I think that the side is better because I'm more likely to make territory eventually. But given how little influence I have towards the center later on, maybe that's the wrong idea.

I think to make territory at the side is in the beginning of a game always better than playing on territory in the middle.]
;W[nf];B[qh]C[I want to make sure to keep white from diving down to the side. But now I'm not sure why. My stones in the corner aren't going to be able to connect to anything anyway.

when you try to safe the stone on q13 with q12 you should connect to the group on the left side because they are safe now and that is alway better than have unconnected stones on the board which are weak. So i think after q12 r12 was okay.]
;W[oh]C[The whole sequence so far is just a disaster for black. Very little territory, no influence, and prisoners already taken. Seems like white started fighting immediately, and had better skills at it.

You are right. At the moment it looks not good for black and with every move you try to make territory on the left side white maks much more with his wall. Now black should really beginn to play at another place on the board]
;B[pj]C[This is the first time I feel like I have a chance to move by more than one stone. I want to stretch a little and break out of the corner.

you make 2 or 3 points with every move on the side and white probably more than 5 or 6. so don't play th the side too much and let white build a huge wall.]
;W[oi]C[But I'm forced to fill in the wall immediately.

i don't see anything black should be afraid for. If white plays at q11 you can still play r11.]
;B[pi];W[pp];B[dp];W[jp];B[dd];W[jd];B[dj]C[Taking the side star point seemed bigger than approaching white at this point. But it also doesn't put any pressure on white, so he plays as he likes and retains the upper hand.]
;W[jj];B[pn]C[With all the star points taken, I think it's time to approach. I'm on the 4-4 points on the left, so no giant hurry to try to make territory there (as opposed to the 3-4 points). I'd rather limit white's giant potential framework.

This attack was good. maybe r6 is al little better because you safe the territory at the side more but it is okay.]
;W[pl]C[I'm always unsure of how to play from this position.]

(;B[ol]C[This time I chose to try to press white against the wall. Maybe the one-stone approach at O8 would have been better?

o8 wouldn't be better. O8 is too open and white can escape easily with p9 or p7. here you have to decide whehter you play p8 or r8.]
;W[om]C[Now I'm already getting into trouble. Q6 is almost surrounded, and P8 is under attack.

cut here at q7 and sacrifice the one stone at p8 is the best here i think.]

(;B[ok];W[pm];B[qk]MA[pl][om][pm]C[Trying to protect my group above, but the empty mouth is no threat when white already has the string at Q8

Yes it is no threat.maybe q9 would be better.];W[pk];B[oj]C[Try to avoid being cut]
;W[nm];B[ql]MA[pn]C[I'm trying to extend what I've got against the wall. I'm also trying to threaten to connect with Q6, but it's an empty threat, because white would like to move at R7 or R6 anyway.

i think it is better to play tenuki here.R8 is small.];W[qm]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[rj]MA[qk][ql][rl]C[Was this too early to protect the group at R9? I think I was imagining that I could be cut at R10.

there is nothing you should be afraid for.When white pays r10 you can still play s10.]
;W[sl];B[sk];W[sm]C[Now I've finally got the initiative. The stone at Q6 seems beyond help, pressed up against the white wall like that. I'm still confined to the right-hand wall, so I'm trying to move out to the center here.]
;B[lk]C[Now I've finally got the initiative. The stone at Q6 seems beyond help, pressed up against the white wall like that. I'm still confined to the right-hand wall, so I'm trying to move out to the center here.

to go to the center and destroy whites moyo there is a good decision.]
;W[kk];B[kl]MA[lj]C[I probably should have blocked at M10 instead. But I really wanted to move out from the wall.

yes m10 would be better and white has to react on this so it is sente for you and sente is always good]
;W[lj];B[mk];W[mj];B[nj];W[ni];B[nl]C[Pretty small move. The one point of territory isn't worth the stone right now, when I've got so much work to do.

it is only 1 point but it saves the connction between the stones on n9 and m10.]
;W[jl];B[km];W[jm];B[mm];W[on]C[Now Q6 is really beyond help

Yes but this one stone is not that important];B[no];W[oo];B[nq]
;W[np];B[mp];W[op];B[gp]MA[jp]C[I'll try to attack and separate white's stone at K4

here you should have played at n5. There are too much cuts for white.]
;W[gn];B[ko];W[jo];B[kn];W[jn];B[iq];W[jq];B[jr];W[ip];B[hq]
;W[hp];B[fp];W[go];B[fm];W[gm];B[fk];W[gl];B[gd]MA[fk][fm][fp]
C[Well, white made a strong presence around H6. But I've got a light enclosure in place with the stones on the F line, so I'll try moving out somewhere bigger.

This three stones are too open. white can still invade...i think you shouldn't extend befor playing f6]
;W[dg];B[eg]C[I'm trying the same thing that didn't work earlier in the lower right.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[ci];B[di];W[cj];B[cm];W[df];B[ef];W[ce]C[Well, that was fairly satisfactory. I finally have some center influence, and I strengthened the lower left corner. But since I had so little territory to start with, maybe the influence I gained isn't worthwhile.

You gained influence but white has this stone at k16 which already makes lots of territory in the middle.]
;B[ic]C[j17 is not so good. white answers with k17 and so white has a little wall that makes him stronger. h17 might be better.]
;W[jc]
(;B[bc]C[This seems a little passive as I look at it now. I think I was afraid that playing at B16 wouldn't be good for me. 

I think it is not to passiv. b17 is a really big move.];W[bd]
;B[jf]MA[jc][jd]C[My plan is to simultaneously attack the K17 string, and connect to J17.

k14 is not really threatening the 2 stones at k17/k16 because they can easily connect to this wall arround p17.and this stone is easy to cut from j17 because it is a little too far away.]
;W[ie]C[But now my chances of connecting are slim];B[if];W[he]

(;B[gf];W[hf];B[hg];W[ge];B[fe];W[gg];B[ff];W[gh];B[hh];W[gi]
;B[fi];W[gk];B[gj]C[I think I already knew I couldn't break in with this, but I wanted to threaten it to force a move. The move that's forced is not to my benefit, however. Have I lost aji with this move?]
;W[hj];B[fj]C[Now I've lost the initiative by the earlier attempt to break through.]
;W[hi];B[je]C[I was hoping that I could save these stones from here]
;W[id]C[But now J7 is threatened, so I can't follow up];B[hc]
;W[ib];B[hb];W[ia];B[ha];W[kb]C[Things are looking grim for black in the center

Yes this stones seems to be as good as dead.];B[de];W[cd];B[cc]
;W[cf];B[dc]C[Was this premature?

it wasn't necessary because theres nochting you should be afraid for when he cuts there.]
;W[ac];B[ab];W[ad];B[ba]C[That whole sequence felt like a mini endgame. White is probably quite happy at this point with how it turned out.


it was endgame but it was good of you to answer.];W[ck];B[dk]
;W[bl];B[bm];W[cl];B[dl];W[am];B[an];W[al];B[bo]C[Now we can see that the center influence I made earlier with the moves around E13 didn't amount to much, while the territory white made at the same time is significant.]
;W[fn]C[Now the looseness of my earlier enclosure comes back to haunt me

yes it was too open...];B[en]MA[ei][ej][ek]C[This was a reflexive block. White couldn't do a lot of damage around D4 even if he came in, so leaving F8 unprotected in order to block means that my hand is forced soon.

On the other hand, the potential territory in the corner is bigger than the little corridor around E10.]
;W[fl];B[em];W[el];B[ek]C[e9 is only one point and it is gote....maybe you should have played n5 instead or another big move.]
;W[oq];B[pr]C[I was proud of this move. It seemed like the first time I had really done something to get ahead of white instead of just following him around.

The only problem is that this move normally isn't possible.]
;W[qq];B[qr]C[I can still go under at P1 if white moves at P2, so I feel safe continuing to reduce white's area in the corner.

when white plays p2 you are cut....if you play p1 then he plays o2 or o1 and your stones in the corner are dead...]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[sr]C[S1 too small];B[rs];W[sq];B[nr]C[Now I have no threats left, so I'd better hurry and connect]
;W[or];B[os];W[mo]C[Oops.];B[lo];W[mn];B[ln];W[nn];B[lq]MA[lo]
[mp][nq]C[At least this time I recognized the triple diagonal.

better late than never];W[kr];B[ir];W[kq];B[kp]C[M2 is bigger i think.]
;W[lr];B[mr];W[ms];B[ns];W[ls];B[ps]C[Was this move necessary?]
;W[ss];B[pq]C[I want to get the initiative, so I threaten to cut]
;W[qo];B[js]C[At this point, I think we're in the endgame.

No you are since probably more than 20 moves in the endgame ;)]
;W[kg]MA[je][if][jf][hg][hh]C[This move surprised me. I had already completely given up on my stones at K14 and H13. Was there anything I could have done with them? it didn't seem like there was enough room to make eyes. So I play several little endgame moves while white hems in those two groups.

no you were right they are dead, but i think white only wanted to make it sure.]
;B[fo];W[ih]
(;B[hd]C[I think this keeps me from having to lose a point by protecting at F17

right.];W[ke];B[fh];W[fg]
(;B[gr]C[Was this move necessary? I'm not sure if a cut could have succeeded.

no it wasn't necessary.];W[cq]C[This surprised me too. I thought a 3-3 invasion would need more open space around it to work. Should I have moved here or nearby on my last move?

hm...hard to say...there is still much room but i think if you react correct a 3-3 invasion doesn't work.]
;B[dq];W[bp];B[cp];W[br];B[cr];W[dr];B[bq];W[cs];B[ap]C[I'm just trying to prevent white from making eyes]
;W[cq];B[ar];W[eq];B[fr];W[er];B[es];W[ds];B[fs];W[eo];B[do]
C[Seems like E4 would have been a mistake, because it would have let white continue to creep into my corner, and possibly threaten the group at E6]
;W[ep];B[fq]C[Seems like white's 3-3 invasion netted him a total of maybe 1 or 2 points by forcing me to play more stones inside my own territory than he played. Does that make it a worthwhile endgame move?

No it wasn't. You made as many moves as he did.



I really hope i could held you with your problems.
The only huger mistake you made, was that you let white build this huge wall on the left, which gave him that much influence.]
