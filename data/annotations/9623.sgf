C[Hello, my name is Thomas from France, and I will do my best to review and comment this game]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[fc];W[cf];B[hd]TR[id]C[Thomas : Usually a step further. this is a bit too close to the previous stone, loosing velocity]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[jp];B[dl];W[cn]CR[dq]TR[jp]C[Thomas : I feel this exchange was not favorable to black. White made an extant and starts securing the corner. Working well with the white triangle stone. Black is surrounded by white and have to make a base.]
;B[ci];W[ch];B[di];W[dh];B[ei];W[db]C[Thomas : Let's think about this move :
- Back can invade the corner (C17) but white group should live
- White forces Black to settle his group. I would play L16 as black.
- White has won ... let's say 8 point. . Playing elsewhere may give you a small base that will give you 2 points, But this base, might be removing black's potential by 10 points. So in total, this thinking is winning 12 points.

So this move has only one goal : securing the corner, while not really putting a pressure on black, as he can easily extend.
It is not a bad move, but a bit/slow move. We are still in the opening, you should reserve this for mid game.

I would personnaly play on the right side ... It''s the most open. I like R8 as it puts some pressure on the corner.]
;B[fb]C[Thomas : This is not a good move. It does not harm white at all, does not make an eye, does not make more than 2 points. The only play is around L16. If Black is really concernened about reducing white's corner,  E18.]
;W[mc]C[Was this a good point for the invasion or was there a better one?

Thomas : An invasion is when one comes into the other player's territory. this is more a reduction move.
If black extend from the left, he secures his base, and you are too far away from the corner to endanger the black stone @ the corner.
White has so many place on the right side. Play first where there is place, then reduce black's territory. This is looking for trouble too early.]
;B[oc];W[jc];B[ib];W[ic];B[hc];W[jb];B[ha]SQ[ib][hc]C[Zamoth : If black wants to defend that (he can flee to the center instead) better play H18 or G18. Those 3 stones are not a good shape if touching a side.]
;W[je]TR[gb]C[Is this move needed/little?

Thomas : This move is OK. White has some pressure all around, this is fine as it secures your group.
Up to now, I still feel white is ahead. If white plays triangle, Black has only one eye. Keep for later if black gets emprisoned
Black stones are more concentrated];B[gq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo]
;B[en];W[go]C[I'm not sure this was the right answer

Thomas : This is one of the best answers.];B[do];W[co];B[dp]
;W[cp];B[eq];W[dr];B[ep];W[fq];B[er];W[fr]
(;B[es];W[br]
(;B[em]C[Thomas : This move only fixes is cut, but is joining all together.]

(;W[ho]C[Thomas : Not needed];B[pk];W[fe]C[Thomas : So many space on the right ! There is no pressure that can be put on the black group. Your group is safe. You gain very few points.
If black plays G18, he lives. If he plays H14 he escapes to the center.]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[hf];W[ff];B[hg]
(;W[pg]TR[hf][hg]C[Same question here: was this a good point for reduce?

Thomas : Your previous move allowed black to add those extra stones. 3 moves ago you had nothing.
But yet, this is not a bad move. I would probably have played it @ R14 to put some more pressure on the corner]
;B[qh]
(;W[pd];B[pc];W[pe];B[qe];W[qf]TR[of]C[Thomas : This sequence is not good at all, starting @ Q16.
This las move barely connect your shape, leaving a potential cutting point at Q14 while not cutting black at all.]
;B[ph];W[og];B[nd];W[le];B[nf];W[ng];B[mf];W[lf];B[mg];W[ne]
C[Thomas : This can not work, I know it is hard, but you ave to read it :
1) Make the right group flee away
2) Make the left hand group alive];B[oe];W[me];B[of];W[pf];B[od]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[rd];W[rb];B[rf];W[rg];B[qg];W[oi]TR[ni]
C[Thomas : Black should remeber this shape. playing @ triangle Kills white.

The 4 last stones were useless. The last 2 costed you 2 liberties while gaining nothing. You must read this before playing it.]

(;B[rh];W[mi];B[lh];W[ol];B[pl];W[om];B[on];W[pm];B[qm];W[nk]
;B[ki];W[mk]TR[lk]C[Here i tried to get a bit of shape but maybe this was little?

Thomas : Ther is no shape at the moment. Flee, Flee, Flee ! I would have played tirangle, go a bit further & help your group fleeing.
Beware, your top center group is not alive.];B[kk];W[hl];B[hj]
C[Thomas : You are lukcy. None of thos black groups are under attack, and this reply is adding some points to black. Black should not have replyed and keep on putting pressure on your weak group. Eventually, the group might die, or white might bring black to its territory for survival.

Remeber, killing must not be an ultimate goal. But While putting pressure on a weak group, may make you win a game (for black)]
;W[mm];B[km]CR[mo]C[Thomas : Wrong side. Black should really have played @ circle instead]

(;B[rm]C[Thomas : not needed. Lucky white !];W[lo];B[oq];W[np]
;B[or];W[nr];B[qq];W[jn]TR[nb][bh][bl][os]C[Thomas : Useless. 2 or 3 points gote. no more. check triangles]
;B[fk]TR[lb][nb][bi][fs][ns]C[Thomas : again small ... Top group does not have 2 eyes yet. Black should gain points, put pressure & see what will be white's answers]
;W[gl];B[fm];W[gm]C[Empty triangle :( But wasn't sure on what move play here]

Thomas : Score is close at the end. Your last mistake was fatal. When watching a game, we must think about the overall result, and my personal feeling is that white was leading. In this case, don't mind loosing a game. I'll win next one.]
