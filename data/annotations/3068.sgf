tminto [10k\]: thanks for the game

Dave: An interesting game for sure. Generally both players tried too many invasions and didn't play them out too well. Its good to know when stones are gone. And sometimes reduction is a more powerful way to play than an outright invasion.

Also both players let themselves get cut apart too easily. Keeping stones connected is important, and to be throwing away stones with abandon in some attempt to create a complex situation can be costly.

I hope you both enjoyed the excitement evident here!
