C[black's strategy in this game was to let white pick off a stone here and there in return for sente.

however, he let white pick off too much.

where should he have fought more?

I: My general advice for you: You can let your opponent just take your stone this easyly. If you want to give away your stone by play light you MUST get some good shape. Thats because by taken your stone, your opponent group is likely to have instant eyes and eyes is very important to strengthent a group. A Group shape after they take one stone called ponnuki, and there is proverb: "ponnuki is worth 30 point".


I: This game, white goes too easy in openning, leading to black favor in early part. Then slowly white come and take a lead until finish. 

I : Biggest mistake in this game for Black was missed the B3 spot, second biggest is an early invasion at G17]

I : K13 and L15 doesnt seems can be connected with one move, so dont bother to play "in middle that 2 groups". To help H13 group, better to play arround J10]
