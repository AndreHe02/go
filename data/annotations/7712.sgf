C[Hi, I'm Marcin Balaban, ~11kyu at DGS as "oslito", you can find me at http://www.dragongoserver.net/userinfo.php?uid=26362
I will try to review the game and to give you some general remarks,
enjoy
In case of any questions please not hesitate and ask by email or by DGS account.

In general - I've put many comments starting from "oslito" and also variations inside the file, try to see the flow of stones, not to memorise all the moves.
BTW, real good game flow you can observe in pros games, for some links check http://harryfearnley.com/bookmark.htm]
;B[qc]C[oslito: Maybe it's question of playing style, but for me san-san so early looks not efficient, as it has no influence on rest of the board.]

;B[dd];W[fc];B[jj];W[db];B[cf]C[I tried to play the corners and then defend them.  Should I play in every corner all the time?
oslito: It's hard or not smart to win all the corners' territory - your opponent would get nice outside thickness all around.]
N[Establish corners.];W[cc]
(;B[cd]C[oslito: black group now is overconcentrated (it means there is no optimal use of stones), as standard extension from 2 stone wall is 3 spaces.
It means you should look for another move - see variation];W[cn]
;B[fq];W[bp];B[cq];W[ck]TR[cd][dd][cf]SQ[ch]C[oslito: Lokk now at marked group - c12 will be sente move for white, as black needs to defend. As the result of black's overconcentration white could take nice territory in sente.]
(;B[dk]C[oslito: What is purpose of this move?
I suppose that was kind of attack...
but...
first - never touch attacked stone, because it makes it stronger (beside that white group is already settled)
second - your c16 group is not settled yet, so it's not good to start fight 
third - there are big points left on the board, so it's too early to start the fight - 
first fuseki (oppening - taking big points, praparation for the fights or to take territory) , 
then chuban (middle game - fighting, taking territory while deciding of life or death of all groups) using influence from fuseki, 
then yose (endgame - fighting for territory while L&D is already deciced)]

I wanted to establish some territory down in the lower left corner around corner A1.  I also intended to try to make some territory gains around corner T19.  Is it proper to already plan to take those corners at this point?

[es][fs]C[(1) I thought that this was one of the closer games for me (even though it still isn't close), because usually my opponents are much stronger, and I do not have a chance to play out so many formations.

(2)  I am not sure what I should be concentrating on to improve my game.  I am not sure what my strengths and weaknesses are (probably everything is weak).

(3)  I did a terrible job of winning any corners, so as a result I had to fight hard to keep the center (and I barely did that).

(4)  I do not know how much room to estimate, in terms of how much space I need to establish a position quickly or if it will be too difficult.

(5) I am unsure whether I need more training in forming opening joseki?  Is this something advisable?  Must I memorize many more opening patterns?  Is this something one has to recall from memory, or does one just play naturally?


oslito: 

(1) regarding number of formations - try to keep not more than 5 groups during the game - it's almost impossible to win having more than 6 groups alive.

(2) try to look at some strong players games - http://gosensations.com/rss/index.php is one of good places for it. Solve tsumego. Play a lot with opponents at similiar level. It's basic way to improve. 

3) Remember, that on 19x19 board there is lot of place at sides - between corners. Center is basicly place for fight, not for territory.

(4) It depends on killing skills of your opponent - I'm sure that I will have no any living group playing against pro, if he just would kill all of them.

(5) Regarding joseki - Usually I do check josekis during review of my games. I use http://www.turbogo.com/text/jostutor.html It's not good to just remember many josekis that one not understand the moves. Just try to check joseki during review and try not to remember, but to understood joseki moves. Then you will play good enough, even if it will be not strictly joseki.]
