C[Alex: I did manage to win this game, because black was kind enough to let me capture a large group, but I think there were several chances for him to escape, so I'm not sure whether my strategy was sound.

I seem to have trouble with running battles, because I attack too hard and get in a mess.  Can you give me some ideas on how to take profit without actually needing to kill a group?

Any other comments you like to make are also very welcome.  Thanks for your help.

go4fun: Hi Alex, this was a nice game. I think you played very well. Please bear in mind, that i am virtually only a few stones stronger than you. So what I say will not be the truth.
But I hope you will enjoy my comments, as I enjoyed this game.

I general your strategy was sound. But you have not to kill the group, but to gain from the influence. At last black defended some territory, and you managed to kill his center group. I think black couldn't escape as aesy. This was a good game.]

;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[cf];W[cj]C[g4: I would press harder with C11.]
;B[fc];W[cc]C[g4: An other alternative is simply E15. Black gets the corner, but white gets enormous influence.]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[fd];W[fe];B[ge]C[g4: E14 is essential I think.]
;W[ff];B[de];W[be]C[Alex: Is this necessary?
g4: I think you must protect your corner, so this is one of the options, but I would prefer E18.]

(;W[gm]C[Alex: Is this a mistake?
g4: This is a good move. You are separating black from the bottom. But you have to keep a look on you center group, which becomes weaker.]
;B[gk];W[qh]C[g4: Black may not answer. What if black plays J9? I don't think white can kill the black top right group.]
;B[qb];W[ob]C[g4: now Q12 was gote.];B[qm]C[Alex: What is the best way to respond to this?
g4: This is too deep. I think white can kill with Q8. See the continuation of your variation.]

(;W[pm];B[pl];W[ql];B[pn];W[om]C[Alex: I think the "joseki" move in this situation is for white to play R6 instead of P7.  I was trying to do something different in order to build thickness and continue the attack on the G9 group.
g4: Positive thinking. And I think I would have done this too.]
;B[qn];W[on];B[ro];W[op]C[g4: O5 seems better to me. It has some outside potential, while P4 is meaningless after blacks response.]
;B[oq];W[ok]C[Alex: I thought about playing O5 instead, but I didn't think black would reply there.
g4: First secure your group, than attack. This was a good move.]
;B[rm]C[g4 Unnecessary.]

g4: Of course not. You can afford to be cut. Your groups are safe, except the center.]

;W[ii];B[jk];W[kl];B[ji];W[ih];B[kk]C[g4: Wrong direction. L12 is better as black may connect to his top right group.]

(;W[lk]C[Alex: better to stand up at M8?  See variation.];B[ll]

(;W[mk]C[Alex: I think I should have played M7 instead.
g4: yes, I think you are right here.];B[km]C[g4: Better at M7]
;W[jm];B[io];W[in];B[ln]C[Alex: is there a way for the white stones to escape now?
g4: This had to be thought some moves before. Now it seems difficult, but it should work. see variation]

(;W[lo]
(;B[kn]C[Alex; if black plays either L5 or N5 instead, I lose the game, right?
g4: I don't think so, but this is too complicated for me to evaluate this during the game.]

(;B[oo]C[Alex: black should play M11 instead?];W[li]C[Alex: the rest of the game is not interesting, unless you can see a way for the black group to live.  He finally resigned on move 225.

Thanks for your help.
