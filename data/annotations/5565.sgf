AB[pd][dp]C[To the reviewer :

Hello! I wrote my comments and questions along the game... enjoy! ^_^

csh: Handicap games are hard. While I expect you were trying to complicate the game and outfight Black, I think there is another way of playing. You can invade Black's moyo to break it up, and let both sides only make small territories, so Black's handicap stones cannot be put to good use.]
;W[pq];B[qo]
(;W[qf]LB[qf:A][qm:B]C[Is it ok to approach here instead of answering?

csh: I think your question has two points. First of all, it is okay not to answer. If you tenuki when your opponent approaches, it is the same as a 3-5 (or 4-5) joseki.

However, in this case, I don't think the approach is good. Black's best response is the pincer, since it tends to give him initiative on the right side, affecting both corners.]
;B[qh]C[csh: This pincer favors Black.];W[qm]C[csh: The counterpincer is an interesting idea.]
;B[qk]TR[qo]C[csh: The problem is that when Black moves here, he stabilizes his pincer stone, while you still need to worry about his marked stone.]
;W[po];B[pf]LB[qn:A]C[csh: This is a calm exchange, but the result favors Black.

Note also that black A can be a pain, since it threatens to connect under, as well as opening up the possibility of a corner invasion.]

(;W[fq]LB[ce:B][qn:C][fq:A]C[Is this approach good?

csh: I like taking the empty corner more. It's bigger. If Black responds, it also limits your possibilities in the upper left.]
;B[cn]C[Should I take the empty corner instead?

csh: The problem is that now you've limited what the stone in the upper left could do. Black could approach from either side, while there is still the possibility of an invasion at the bottom of the board. It's probably best to build the center and wait.]

(;W[jp]LB[dd:B][jp:A]C[csh: It's probably best to be patient.]
;B[dd]
(;W[cl]LB[jc:B][cl:A]C[csh: I think this is an overplay. You are expecting Black to play D2, but if he doesn't, you don't have much of an attack on his corner. Maybe just breaking up the top might be a better move.]
;B[di]TR[cl]C[csh: After this move, your marked stone is under more pressure than Black's corner.]

(;W[em]LB[el:B][fl:C][em:A]C[is f7 too agressive?

csh: I think so. The problem is that Black can play D2 and solidify his corner. You still have to worry about the ladder if Black cuts at D8.]
;B[fo];W[fp]TR[cl][em]C[csh: This is an odd move. It forces Black to play and strengthen his group. Your two marked stones will be hurt.]
;B[eo]TR[cl][em];W[go]C[csh: Again, playing from the wrong side.]
;B[gn]C[Maybe something like e9 intead of w h6... hard to say... ^^

csh: H6 is the right move, locally. The fact that you might play E9 says that E7 is the wrong move in the first place.]

(;W[ho]LB[ek:A][ho:A]TR[em]C[csh: This move is definitely correct. The fact that you are considering playing at A shows that the marked stone is probably the wrong move.]
;B[dm]C[csh: A little vulgar, but it still works.];W[dl];B[el]
;W[dj];B[ek];W[ci];B[dh]
(;W[ch]LB[ch:A][ej:B]C[csh: See the variation. It's more important to get out to the center.]
;B[ej]C[csh: The problem is that when Black connects across, it is really hard to put any pressure on his corner group.]
;W[dg];B[eg]
(;W[eh]LB[df:B][eh:A]C[csh: This is a bad move.];B[ei]C[just c13 here?

csh: C13 or D14 is better, but the E12/E11 trade should not be made.]

(;W[ef]LB[ef:A][cg:B];B[cg];W[df]C[csh: Since you can't afford to just take, it shows how bad E12 is.]
;B[cj];W[bj];B[bg];W[ck];B[ce];W[fg];B[id]C[csh: There is no real chance for White at this point. Black has more potential territory and no weak groups. White's two groups still need a lot of moves to secure them from attack.]
;W[fm]C[csh: Best chance, I guess, but it's a long shot. The stones have nowhere to run.]
;B[gm];W[fl];B[gj];W[gl];B[hl];W[hk];B[il]C[g9.... how could I miss this... ;p]

(;W[fi]LB[fi:A][gk:B];B[gk]C[csh: Yeah, after this, the game's over. The white cutting stones are captured, and you have two groups that are still not alive. You are also behind in potential territory.]
;W[hm];B[hn];W[im];B[in];W[jm];B[jn];W[dk];B[hj]TR[hk]C[csh: Saving this stone does nothing. It's not a cutting stone anymore.]
;W[ik];B[jl];W[jk];B[km];W[ii]TR[fl][gl][em][fm]C[Now I am quite desperate
^_^

csh: The marked stones are captured, so Black is connected together. The game's over at this point.]

csh: No, but nothing else I see works, either. The black L7 group is too strong, and you annot connect back in time. Your only hope is to exploit a possible cut at P9/Q8, but I don't think that will work, either. Even if the center group gets out and lives, I think you are too far behind to be able to win.]
