C[gemedet [12k\]: hi

For Reviewer:
First of all, thank you for taking the time to review this game.

Me: Black (Sumatakyo)
In general I found the game pretty balanced. There were no major fights... which was maybe the problem. My biggest preoccupation would be understand how to infiltrate the white territory on the left. I had not idea how I could do this. Also, I am wondering if there were better ways of defending from the white invasion at move 58. Finally, I usually lose because of either too defensive or too rash moves. If you spot any of these, could you point them out?]

;B[qj];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[cf];B[dc]C[Hmm, a probe....

Unless you really have a plan, this can give your opponent some serious thickness.

I'd consider either somewhere around F16/F17 pr C10 tp prevent a huge left side, or maybe R3?

This just worries me.];W[cc];B[ec]C[This really worries me.  Your D17 stone should be treated lightly.  A hane to gain leverage or even a cut at C16 would keep your options open.  This begins to look heavy to me.]

;B[jc]C[I agree that making  a base is important here.];W[lc]
LB[kb:A][kd:B]C[Feeling adventurous?  Old Kage says "if you can cut, cut".

After L17, White doesn't have a ladder.

What would the result be?  Who knows, but a weak white group is created, and that can't be a bad thing for you.]
(;B[kb]C[Would another move been better here? Perhaps R18 or L17?]

(;B[jj]C[I'd rather expand more slowly at R10.  I can't see a guarantee of making the K10 stone look good.]
;W[nf];B[oh];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[od]C[Way too slow.  This is gote.]
;W[nd]C[The fact that your opponent responds to gote shouldn't make you feel better about it.  When you get stronger, your opponent will ignore P16 and make you suffer.]
;B[en]TR[jj]C[Moves like K10, E6, try to build the roof of your house before the walls are in place.  There's a lot of empty space in there.]
;W[dl];B[fl];W[jm]C[Let's talk about move 58.  You assume that your inability to find a good response to it made you lose the game.

In fact, usually, we lose the game before we think we do.

The moves you made that made K7 possible made you lose the game.  

K10 and E6, which are very ambitious moves, are not incremental, slow and steady building moves.  They end up trying to do more than they can, and you end up with a huge internal territory which is not possible to defend.

You should have been aiming at P10 and K5, which build securely and threaten to build more.  Solid moves like that make your opponent panic, when they realize that they're about to lose to a giant territory.  This terror can cause them to overstep and create a weak group, which you can then chase to victory. (there are other possibilities of course).

There are many other things that I could talk about, but I think that learning one lesson well from a game is better than confusing it with many different concepts.

Try making these slow and hugely secure moves, that make territory and threaten to make much more.  This is the way to build your moyo; not to build "castles in the air", roofs without walls.

I'm ending the review here; I hope this was useful to you.]
;B[mh]C[Hmm.  I think move 58 was necessary for white because obviously black moyo is too big. In my opinion, this move is what made me lose the game, well, my lack of a good response to it.  Should I have cut at h9? k5? or maybe this is a good time to attack the left side of white, while it is still weak. but... I don't know how I would go about doing that. White's left side looks pretty solid.]
