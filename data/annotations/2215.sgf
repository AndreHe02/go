C[Warp:  I would like comments specially about fuseki
and invasion techniques. Thanks.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ec];B[fq]
;W[oc];B[pf]C[Maybe q15 is better because it press better  p17 but this is joseki too]
;W[qo]
(;B[np]C[In this case maybe it's better a pincer because you have 2 stone in the top right corner. O4 is too timid.]
;W[pm];B[cn]C[Would it have been better to play around K4 or Q10?
Or perhaps attack the upper left corner?

Fausto: C6 is better because it aim to destroy the white side. Q10 is possible  but maybe is better R10 in that situation to press better the 2 white stone in the bottom left corner. Is too early to play k4. Another good move could be Q17.]
;W[eo];B[dl];W[df];B[cd]C[Is this a good invasion point?

C16 is a good invasion point, C17 too but maybe it isn't still the time to invade because this is open territory and an external reduction could be better. Another chance is to play a stone like this as agi for external reduction.
In this moment move like q17, k17, r4 are bigger then c16.]

(;W[ce];B[dd];W[ed];B[be];W[cf];B[cb];W[bf];B[ad]C[black is alive? :)
is better b17 instead of a16]
(;W[cj];B[ch]C[Too risky to make an invasion here because of the influence of the C14 group?

Yes  it's a little wrong move.   B4 is better or d11 instead of c12]

(;W[eh]C[this  is wrong];B[di];W[ej];B[dj];W[dk];B[ck];W[ek]
;B[cl]C[On
the other hand, it succeeded pretty well as white did not defend more
aggressively...

Yes white play bad in this situation but however c12 is a mistake and white is becoming very strong in central influnce]
;W[el];B[bj];W[hd]
(;B[lc]C[A black stone in m17 will suffer. It's better to play q17 and then if white extend try to reduce him. q17 is big.]
;W[nd];B[le];W[nf];B[qb]C[Better around Q12?

No this is good because you steal the base to your opponent]
;W[pc];B[qc]C[In this case maybe is better to reinforce the 2 stone in the top side with move like j18 or k16]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[of];B[pg];W[qj];B[ip]C[j3 or k3 is better to prevent invasions]
;W[kp]C[How to best defend against this invasion?

It's difficult to say...I show you a possibility]
