C[Hello Augustin!

Let's have a look at your game.


-Sakke];B[dq];W[pp]
(;B[qn]C[I always wondered if R6 was a good move. That isn't a little too agressive ?


- It isn't a terrible move but at this point I would say taking an open corner is larger. D16 or C16 for example are 
good direction of play since they

1. take an open corner
2. have a little bit more open space than the other open corner (Q16) because the white stone is 
on the fourth line and your D3 is on the third.

I often used the following guidelines of the opening to something like 7-8 kuy KGS and still use them (4 kuy KGS) to some extent.
1. open corners
2. an approach or an enclosure for a corner with a 3-4, 3-5 or 4-5 stone. (So not yet for 4-4 or 3-3, they are slightly smaller)
2. an optimal extension from a corner which would've been optimal for you opponent too. (example in the game tree)
3. other extensions from the corners
3. enclosures and approaches to 4-4 and 3-3 stones.

After an approach it's good to play joseki although it's not written here. There are of course many many exeptions to these 
but they give a general idea.]
(;W[co]
(;B[gp]C[- I think this move can sometimes be good but F4 is a more solid option if you want to play this direction. It's also good to consider pincering.]
;W[cl];B[dd];W[pd];B[nc]C[This is a good move. You could also consider playing a double approach at around O3 since it is a double purpose move: puts pressure on Q4 and extends from the D3-G4 -formation.]
;W[fd];B[cf]C[I'm not sure that C14 was a good move, because after the opponent move (D17), I think that my stones are weak...

- C14 is a good solid response here.];W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[cb]
C[Was it useless ?

-This is a very good move to play. It makes your group in the corner strong and undermines the base of the white group. Also it may 
have the additional benefit of letting you take some points away from white in the endgame by jumping to F19 (monkey jump).]
;W[jc]
(;B[ne]C[- It's good that you helped the stone that got pincered. 

It depends on your preferences but I would either take the 3-3 point (see joseki played out in the game tree) or change direction with Q14 or R14. Changing the direction has the additional benefit of helping R6 a little bit.

When you approach a 4-4 stone and get pincered, jumping in the center usually ends up giving you 
influence in the center and giving your opponent some territory. This is sometimes a good move if you have a plan on what to do with the influence.]
;W[pf];B[pb]C[- Whether this is good (after the jump) depends on the situation but it's good to understand that the Q18-R17 exchange takes 
away the possibility for jumping to 3-3 and stealing your opponents corner points later in the game.]
;W[qc]
(;B[rp]C[- This is not a bad move but a little bit slow. Making a base or shape for the O17 group seems like a good idea so that white wont be 
able to profit by attacking it. Also moves around O3 seem large for the previously mentioned dual purpose of helping your own 
stones and putting pressure on your opponents'.];W[qb]C[- Now I would feel even more inclined to help the O17 group.]
;B[qk]C[- This is a good shape from the common joseki but in this case since white hasn't played stones in the area, it's also a little 
bit slow. If you thought your R6-S4 stones were weak and in need of strenghtening, this move was a good one for that purpose, making a very good base for eyes.]
;W[iq];B[bp]C[- I suppose the idea is to get room for eyes in the corner which is logical. I would also consider C4 and D5. J3 was a nice one to 
play for white against your large knight.];W[lq];B[np]C[I hesitated with O3, but I was a little scared.

- O3 might lead to complicated local fighting. White would probably cover it with O4 and the both players would try to connect their own stones and separate the opponents stones to two. I would say that here if your plan is to harass the white stones on 
the bottom side a little bit, it's very important that you end up with sente.]
;W[nq];B[oo];W[ng];B[kb]C[- Good. Also L16 might be worth considering. Your black group on the upper side must live.]
;W[ph];B[qi]C[- This is a good idea (at least locally) because it makes a couple of points and threatens to slide underneath of white's position.]
;W[qh];B[ci]C[- If you think O17 is safe enough this or C10 is a nice move to put pressure on the white group.]
;W[oq]
(;B[qq]C[- This is an ok move since the corner points are not that small but two other things come to mind also:

1. Attacking the two space extension on the left side. At this point this means trying to surround it.
2. Playing a stone around O10 and expanding the right side group to the center.]
;W[bn];B[ff]C[- Expanding to the center. If white were to surround O17 group, after that this would've been a large move for white, so good also from that point of view. This also looks to lean on D8 and create some points in the center.]
;W[gr];B[fq];W[cj];B[dj];W[hd];B[ga]C[I think 45 was definitely a strange move, but I wanted to enter its territory, and it seemed to me safe.

- White can block the connection of G19 to C18 but I guess it can then connect to L18. Interesting and imaginative move. F19 
is the basic monkey jump that connects to C18 without the help of L18.]
;W[jb];B[kc];W[jd]
(;B[ea]C[- If G19 would have been on F19, you could've played elsewhere here. Anyway this was a cool reduction of points.]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[ig];B[hh];W[lg];B[hk]C[I didn't really know how to play, so I tried to do a potential territory (moyo ?).

- It's not a bad idea at all. The sides and corners are pretty much played so the center remains. If it seems hard to profit by attacking and it seems that none of your groups can be attacked severely, extending  to the center is a logical thing to do. 
Although at this point I would think twice to make sure O17 group is alive because it's surrounded and thus cannot run to safety and has to live locally.]
;W[ob]C[- Here is a point where I would use a lot of time to figure out how to live.]
;B[oc];W[le];B[pa];W[lc];B[lb]C[I chose to sacrifice 51.

- Which is a good idea. I don't think it's useful to analyze this life and death too deeply now but in my opinion, keeping groups so strong that you don't have to worry about them maybe dying is very good (unless it's an adventurous invasion) since then your opponent has a lot less forcing moves against them.]
;W[md];B[mc];W[io];B[hn]C[- O10 looks nice. Also at this point you could already start playing endgame moves like B10, F2, Q2, S12 and such.]

* Sente and gote. It's worth a lot that a variation ends in a way that you can play next, i.e. you have sente. In the endgame the computer took quite a few points away from you by playing sequences where you had to play the last stone.

* Tenuki. Tenuki means playing away from the local situation. You (and almost every go player until they reach a certain level) have the tendency to answer opponent's moves. This way you opponent can get away with playing moves in sente that shouldn't be sente.

I am confident that if you keep these two in mind and follow (not blindly of course) general opening principles and remember to take care of your groups (before they are in a very bad situation), you are going to be a single-digit kuy in no time.
