Comments by white

=====

This is a game I played yesterday, and it is a fair example as my game as a whole right now.  I have noticed that when I play other around 10k, my success hinges on how well I stick to go principles and apply them in the game through correct judgement.

When I stick to principles and make good judgements I win, often by large margins.  When I make bad judgements or play away from principle, I lose.  In this game I have done both and won by a small margin.  I have submitted it the GTL in hopes of getting a second opinion on my thought process; re-enforcing good judgement and eliminating bad judgement.

I have also interspersed comments throughout the game; these are mainly notes on my thoughts.  Please let me know at least if I'm on the right track.  Any comments in the sgf from the game have been removed.  Thanks in advance for your review.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this review.

All of my comments will begin with "RR:"];B[pd];W[dd];B[dp]
;W[pp]C[RR:  Criss-Cross beginning is the start of a fighting game.]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[ic];W[qf]CR[fq]TR[pf]LB[fq:a][pf:b]C[This is to keep black from making a double wing formation.  Even with the stone at J17, I aim to counter-pincer if black decides on a pincer and push into S16 if he does not.

RR:  One of the things that I've learned over the years is to worry about your own space, instead of always being worried about what your opponent is doing.  As white, you are one move behind, and it looks like black has this huge expansion, while white has nothing.  Because of komi, I wouldn't worry too much about black getting a double wing formation.

I would play 1 of the two marked spots instead.  The spot in the lower left (F3) is a good point to play, as it will push black into the white stronghold into the top left.  The other spot, on the right side (Q14) is one spot higher than the spot played by white.  It is hard to explain why this is better, but because the black stone is on the 4th line, by putting the white stone on the 4th line will allow an easier escape to the center.]
;B[qh];W[of]TR[qc]C[RR:  This is 1 of two right moves.  At this point, white could also jump into the 3,3 point and take the corner.  But I like this move better.]
;B[nc];W[qj]TR[oh]C[RR:  Hard to attack the lone black stone here.  It might be easier to cap the black stone (P12), and play along the right side.]
;B[oh];W[mf];B[ql]C[RR:  This is a good attack of the lone white stone.]

(;W[oj]C[It was either this or R6.  I played this because during the game because I felt the variation was too easy on black.

RR:  I agree, but white will have a tough job to keep both white groups.]
;B[rj];W[qn]MA[mh][ol]C[I figured it was my last chance to play this and I can't preven the connection between black's two groups.

RR:  I think this move hurts the white groups.  Some sort of extension from the top group, or the two stones would be best.  I do agree that R6 is a big point, but I don't know if you can play it yet.]
;B[rk];W[rd];B[ne]
(;W[qc]TR[nf]C[Looking back, I feel this was too early.  After black cuts, I have no leverage to push down on black's group at P12 with.  (See variation)

RR:  Yes.  White has to connect against the peep.  White needs to keep connected to the center.  If black cuts the white group, and white lives in the corner, black will be far ahead. The moyo/territory in the top side will be huge for black.]
;B[nf];W[he]TR[ng]C[Here I'm looking to press black down to the edge.  I was afraid of H16 because after black F15 white is cut off and with nowhere to run.

RR:  I would not let black connect the stones, and play at O13.  Staying connected into the middle is a good strategy.  Even though black can cut white, white can also cut black.

As an overall strategy, I would suggest to not worry about how big your oppoent is getting, and try to build your territory too.]
;B[gd];W[ff];B[ck]C[Seems to be the wrong direction to extend on Black's part.

RR:  For the same reason that white played H15, black was afraid of white's wall on the top side, and approaced it safely.  As a "big move" play, I think this is blacks best move.]
;W[jq]TR[qn]C[RR:  If the marked stone was on the 4th line, this would be be an excellent extension.  As it is, it is a good extension.]
;B[ol];W[fq]C[I ignore black's attack to make one of my own.

RR:  Black didn't make a sente move, so it is ok to follow a gote move with a gote move.]
;B[np];W[oq]TR[on]C[This was my defense to black's unexpected attack.  I am hoping black plays O3, since he cannot make the ideal extension to K3 or K4 afterwards.

RR:  This is a good attack for black.  Whites defence here is to take the corner.  This is probably the best move.   I would also consider P6, to block the black stone from connecting]
;B[mq];W[lp]C[I thought black's play was another unorthodox play; I set my stone on what I thought was the key point of his formation.  I felt that a tiger's mouth would have radiated power upwards and effectively given him control over the center.

RR:  Black's play seemed good to me.  Black kept white seperated, and white doesn't have a good counter attack.
White's counter attack is probably the best one.  It prevents black from making a nice shape.  Black's only option right now is to jump to the center, and connect to the other black stones.]
;B[po]C[RR:  Wow.  I didn't see this move!  This is a good attack move by black.]
;W[qo];B[op];W[pq];B[lq];W[ci]TR[fp]C[I ignore again to make a sente attack.  Perhaps my group is a bit thin to be doing this, but I felt that since I still had access to the lower right corner I was fine.

RR:  I think the lower right group is ok, but the lower group is very thin.   I would consider playing F4, which makes a nice extension to th e K3 stone (but is very slow).]
;B[cn]TR[ek]C[RR:  This is a small move by black.  Black is trying surround just a small amount of territory.  Black should extend to the marked E9 spot.]
;W[dr];B[hq]C[This I understand as a play to make when the lower side is developable by black.  In this case, I couldn't make sense of it.  I decided to use it to fortify my wall facing north and to connect my F3 group to my K3 group.

RR:  Black is using this attack to split the two weak white groups.  Black is strong on either side, so the two white groups will be squeezed.]
;W[gp];B[jr];W[hp];B[ir];W[iq]TR[ip]C[RR:  It is usually a bad idea to play in into this local situation.  2 stones, with your opponent around you on 3 sides.  To connect, play at the J4 location.]
;B[kq];W[jo];B[kp];W[ek]LB[ej:A]TR[nr][pn][pc][ec][cq][kc]C[I decide also that the M5 stone is unimportant and that I should cap at E9.  Looking back, I think a knights move attack [E10 (A)\] would be a much better attack since it simultaneously puts pressure on black's group in the lower right, enlarges my group in to top right, and pushes black towards my new wall on the bottom.  I felt at the time that if black decided to push through at D10, I could defend my territory, treat E19 lightly, and use it later to be a thorn in black's side.

RR:  I agree, the M4 stone is unimportant, it is pretty much captured.  I think that white is looking for a "big" move, and I'm not sure that E9 or E10 is the right one.  I think that each corner has a big move left.  Corner moves are generally better than moves in the middle.

This is a turning point in the game, when the middle game really takes over.  It is a good time to stop and take a look at where the game is.  Black has 5 groups, and they are all pretty safe (might be able to do something to the lower black group)  Black has some territory on the top side (which can be reduced) and some territory on the left side (which can also be reduced.)

White has 4 groups, and 2 floating stones (P10 & R10)  White has territory from 3 of the groups, and potential from one.  The groups seem pretty solid, with the top right group a little weak.

As White, I would be worried about 2 different areas.  First, the 2 floating stones at P10 and R10.  If black captures these, then that area will get rather large.  The other area is the top side, where black can make a large territory.  I think that these two areas need more attention than trying to expand the upper left.]
;B[dj];W[di];B[ej];W[fi];B[ei];W[eh];B[fj];W[gi];B[fl];W[gj]
C[This move prepares to pull out the stones at P10.

RR:  The P10 stones now have three safe areas to go.];B[je]
C[It is ignored; I feel I should try to neutralize that stone before pulling P10 out.

RR:  Good idea];W[hd];B[hc];W[jd];B[id];W[ie];B[jf];W[ge];B[ed]
;W[dc];B[ee];W[ef];B[me]C[I was expecting black to push in sente twice more; this was a lucky departure from my thought.

RR:  Now black has a large top side territory.  Fortunatly, white got both corners, or else black would be too huge.]
;W[mj];B[nk];W[nj];B[ll];W[oo]TR[pn]C[And here is the nearly losing move.  I felt that if I let black build a wall across to his other group, he would negate my center and make too much territory in the center for me to come back from.  I should have counted before making this judgement; as it was quite bad.  Instead, I decide I can force my way into his territory and possibly connect to the P10 group through the hole at Q8.

RR:  I don't see white's center which black would negate.  I would have pushed up from Q6 to get into the black territory in the middle.
Connecting P10 through Q8 would be quite a miracle :).  Now, the P10 needs to connect to the left side, the last place available.]
;B[no];W[on];B[kj];W[nl]C[Now I am in big trouble.  O8 is my desperate attempt to free P10.

RR:  I agree.  The white stones are in big trouble now.  The confusion that white is starting here is probably the best move.]
;B[mk];W[pl];B[pk];W[pm];B[ok];W[pj];B[qk];W[ph]C[Another desperate attempt.]
;B[pg];W[pi];B[og];W[qg];B[ri];W[kh];B[li]LB[jh:A]C[After the game, we discussed a black move at K12 (A).  We came to the conclusion that had black played A here, white would have no choice but to resign (actually, there was a very large ko involved, but starting a 40 point ko is unlikely).  Instead I was able to pull out the N14 stone.

RR:  I agree that K12 (A) would be a huge fight (and will take your word that it results in a ko.)    Black seems so strong here, that it would be very difficult for white to win a fight.

The played black stone effectivly kills the white stones, but does leave some outside aji (which white takes advantage of.)]
;W[lg];B[mh]C[RR:  Black making sure white stays dead.];W[fk]
C[According to my opponent, this move won me the game.

RR:  This is a good move.  Black cannot cut.  Suddenly, black is without center access.]
;B[dk];W[el];B[cq];W[jl];B[jj];W[ih];B[ig];W[ij];B[en];W[fm]
;B[ko];W[jn];B[fn];W[gn];B[em];W[gl];B[dl];W[nr]C[From here on out, I play a very aggressive endgame, hoping to keep sente long enough to continue to make points.]
;B[nn];W[ob];B[nb];W[oc];B[od];W[bj];B[bk];W[eb];B[fb];W[qb]
;B[ik];W[jk]C[This defense does not kill the J9 stone, but it is perhaps the best I have.]

;B[qd];W[rc];B[es];W[tt];B[lk];W[tt];B[tt]C[So after my thrashing about in the endgame, poking again and again, I eke out a 5.5 point victory despite the loss of my Q10 group.  I felt that my endgame was quite good in this game, as it effectively won me the game.  My opponent feeling he had a won game and playing simple defenses surely helped considerably as well.

I also feel that if I had made a sound judgement about those seven stones at Q10 and connected them to my stones in the west that the game would have been an easy victory, as black's territory made by capturing those stones is much larger than my territory around H6.

Finally, do you have any suggestions on improvement?  I've resolved to play more games; as I feel it is the best way to hone my judgement.  I also am actively reading the Elementary Go Series, and I own a copy of Kageyama which I have read thrice but haven't looked at for several months.  Thank you very much for your time.

RR:  For improvements, I would suggest looking at the big picture more.  White's moves indicate a fighting style, and white seems to be more worried about Black's territory instead of building his/her own.  However, white does have good fighting style, and fighting is fun. :).   So, I think that reading a book about direction of play, and how to use walls to attack your enemy.  Kageyama is a good book, I remember reading that years ago, and it really helped me alot.]

(;W[nf];B[qc]LB[rc:A][hd:F][kf:D][mh:C][rh:B][jq:E]C[This looks a bit better for white, though I'm not exactly sure of where to go from here.  Some thoughts:

S16 (A) - looks possible but unnecessarily small.
S12 (B) - not sure about this; I may be able to connect to the P10 group and cut off a stone in the process if black fights.
N12 (C) - Threatens to connect and pushes out to the center, but black can ignore it since he has room on the side.
L14 (D) - Threatens to cut the J17 group off from the top right.  Perhaps not so effective when F17 still has access to the corner.
K3 (E) - A big point.
H16 (F) - Hoping to push black down.

Given the situation, my instinct is to choose C.

RR:  White has no eyes yet, so that would be my highest priority.
[A\] is too small, with no eyes
[B\] can be attacked too easily.  How would white answer if black plays R13?
[C\] Black would cut at O11, splitting the two white groups.  Right idea.  Maybe if white sacrafices the two stones to build a wall?  Probably a bad idea, since there are really no white stones to work with that wall.
[D\]  Remember, the priority is life or to run.  so don't worry about attacking black here.  But this is the best spot to run with.  However , I would play N15 first, to make black overconcentrated.  Then extend to K15.  (See variation)
[E\]  True.  But white needs to finish the upper side
[F\]  Right idea.  What about on the other side?  K16?  If black jumps out, white can stay one step ahead, and build a wall facing the N14 stones.]
;W[me];B[md];W[je]C[RR:  I like this variation.  Black is pushed down on the top side, white is connected out into the center, and the two white stones are not put under pressure.]
))
(;W[qn];B[pj]C[After this, black is settled and white still has a weak group on top to worry about before he can extend to K4.

RR:  White does have some nice Aji in this area though.  Lots of forcing moves could used in this area.]
))
