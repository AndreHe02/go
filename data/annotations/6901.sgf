in same situation try building thickness by attacking 1 group, then attack with the thickness you just build so that other group will surely suffer.
this method has a drawback if they ignore your move then your whole plan will be in ruin. so make sure you can get enough compensate if they ignore your move. this often involve life and death problem so alot of practise will definitely improve your strength and also your planning.]

generally you like to play safe,which is also pretty much my style. you still lack of instict for good shape. and always remember to think of hane or block first in life and death situation. also if you meet player that like to play wild just play safe which is your style and slowly they will fall on their own.

Lee Changho is a brilliant master that like to play simple, you can have a look for his game for fun and practise simple life and death so you wont fall for tricky player trick. and also try to count how much you lose and how much you gain during yose since you lose quite alot of points there.

cheers 
hv fun playing go])
