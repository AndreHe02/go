RS: Hi Pakiozzie. I am 7k on DGS and due to raising 2 young boys, I rarely play on KGS though I do enjoy watching games. I'm rasa on DGS if you care to look. I take it from your comments, you wish to have the endgame reviewed rather then the fuseki or chuban. Ok.

The only reason you lost this game on points is because of 2 moves which cost you 38 points. Fortunately, there is 1 reason why you lost those stones. That reason is that you neglected to count the liberties of your groups. 

From a 5d, I have learned that if any of my groups has 5 liberties or less, I need to watch that group veeeery carefully. If any group only has 4, I have to know *exactly* if it is safe. If only 3, alarm bells should be going off and immediate attention is almost always necessary. 

In speaking with another 5d, he remarked he does not play on IGS or KGS at all because he misses liberties when he counts. What they do, we need to do.

Go to move 62, and you will see here is where your group only has 2 liberties and does so for the next 152 moves. Then go to move 219, and you'll see your b9 group only has 3 liberties.

Good practice, would be to go through this game again and count the liberties of *each* group for each move. I know that this seems boring, but, I believe, it is vital since it is easy to do and will make a biiiiig difference in your wins. If someone had told me this when I was 18k, I would be bowing down to their photo each game I played. No, I'm not sending you my photo. ;-)

As practice, how  many groups do you and W have and how many liberties does each group have? My guess is in the variation to the next move.]

My opponent resigned but i actually thought that i had a chance of loosing this game.


Thx for reviewing my game :)

RS: Yes, W was winning the game at this point: W+9.5.

You lost 4 groups which are shown with 'x's, but you lost them because like me even though you know how to count liberties, you did not know when the danger point was: 5 liberties or less per group. I was very surprised to learn this from the 5d. Please try and practice this by going over your games and/or games of other players on KGS. For this, I would even recommend games from players your rank or just little higher. 

Any questions? Just write.])

The 1st number is the number of stones in that group; the 2nd, the number of liberties. 'Al' means the group is unconditionally alive and liberties don't count.

Interesting to see that of the 21 groups total, there are only 2 groups alive. Of course, this is the beginning and many of these will turn into alive groups, but you do not know which of them will and for this reason you need to count the group liberties.]
