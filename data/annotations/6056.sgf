C[This game was played in an airport, waiting a flight, between myself (Fábio Costa - White) and a friend (Marcelo Toyama - Black). I'm KGS 21k.. That was a even game, 6.5 komi. I give black for my friend cause he said he didn't play go long before.

K- hello, my name is Kester, I am doing your review. My comments are shown by 'K', like this one]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp]LB[de:A]C[K- so a diagonal opening, 3 star points and 1 komoku. Black should immediately approach at A.]
;B[on]LB[de:A]C[That could be a good approach to maintain some influence in a crossed opening?

K- in a diagonal opening, your first priority should be to settle your groups. You might need to play urgent points like A first, but settling at least 1 of your opening corners is important. Influence is not a priority yet.

Also, at this stage of the game, you should play most of your moves on the 3rd and 4th line, so that you can settle the stones quite easily.]
;W[dm]LB[fp:A][de:B]C[In a crossed opening, how could be the best way to cut white's stones and warrant lower left corner for black?

K- if black especially wants to protect the lower left corner, he can defend here at A.

However, white's move is not a strong threat to black's corner, so black can ignore this move and play a big point elsewhere, the most important is the approach at B]
;B[ck];W[bn]LB[bp:A][ck:B][cf:C][np:D]C[K- I guess that white is trying to separate black's stones with this, but it is not a good move, because black can easily defend the corner at A, and the stone at B is not in any danger.

From white's point of view this move does not gain anything - neither territory nor influence nor eye space.

White's best moves here are to take corner territory at C or threaten black's floating stone at D (it is unlikely that white can kill this stone but just by threatening it white can make territory).]
;B[fo]TR[bn][dm]LB[fq:A][fm:B][kp:C]C[This keima was a good response?

K- it all depends what black is trying to achieve. This move is setting up an attack on white's marked stones, however it is leaving the lower side and corner open to a white invasion - imagine a white stone at A.

Black might be planning to force white to respond around B, allowing black to play around C, however if white does play at B, black's stone on the left side is vulnerable.]
;W[gm]LB[fm:A]C[K- this is too thin due to black's stones close below - black can split white's stones starting by playing at A.]
;B[im]LB[kp:A]C[K- black should play around A to make teritory here,]
;W[io]C[K- good move by white, taking advantage of black's mistake on the previous move]
;B[hn]LB[gk:A][lp:B]C[K- if black is attempting to split white's stones and connect to his stones below, he will probably succeed. However, the plan is flawed because black is pushing white into jumping towards A (which threatens the marked black stone) and B (which makes territory for white)]
;W[jl];B[il];W[hm];B[in];W[ik]LB[ek:A][lp:B][cf:C]TR[bn][dm]
C[That was bad shape?

K- shape is ok but what is white achieving here? the black stones are not in danger from this move, and white has better moves available at A and B.

Note that C is no longer a good move for white because black will jump to A, which threatens white's marked stones]
;B[fn];W[fm];B[em];W[el];B[en];W[cm];B[dk];W[dl];B[gn];W[fl]
;B[jn]LB[cg:A][ce:B][bp:C][jd:D]C[K- bad move!

Firstly, it is bad shape - makes an empty triangle.

Secondly, black has just forced white to connect his stones (which white should be happy about), so black needs compensation now. This move will not make territory for black, the white stone can easily escape, so black should play elsewhere. Playing at A is ideal - although it induces white B which is good for white, black's group is then safe AND black can then play either C (for territory) or D (for a moyo).]

;B[iq];W[lp];B[np];W[ml];B[nn]LB[om:A]C[K- bamboo joint at A is better shape]
;W[nq];B[po];W[oq];B[jr];W[jq];B[ir];W[kr];B[ks]TR[hp][iq][jr]
LB[bp:A]C[K- black is doing a good job of making territory with the marked stones. This move is too small though, it would be better to play at A to make the corner safe.]
;W[lr];B[bl];W[ek]LB[cg:A]C[K- this is an opportunity for white to attack black's weak stones on the left side, with a move such as A for example, which makes territory for white while attacking black]
;B[fi]LB[ej:A]C[K- black has the right idea - threatening the white stones while running out to the centre and preparing to make territory on the left side. However, this move does not work - white can simply push at A and black's stones on the edge are in severe danger]
;W[mr]C[K- not needed];B[gj];W[gk]C[K- good move];B[hj];W[hk]
;B[ij];W[fk]LB[jj:A]C[K- serious mistake - this should be at A, connecting white's stones and pushing out of black's wall]

;B[do];W[jg]TR[jk]LB[jj:A]C[K- this move would work much better if the marked stone had been played at A!]
;B[cp]LB[bp:A][bq:B]C[K- A is better, with this move white can still jump in at B]

;B[gh];W[bh];B[jj];W[ki];B[oc]LB[pj:A]C[K- would be better at A]
;W[ld];B[nb];W[nd]LB[bq:A][fd:B][gc:C][kj:D][pj:E]C[In this, black has lower left, I (W) have upper left, and right it is at some way undisputed. How could be the best approach for black and white to attack right side?

K- black's lower left is open to invasion at A. White's top left is vulnerable  to cutting moves at B and C. Black has the upper right corner, white has the lower right. On the right side, white has strong influence but has a weakness at D. Black has groups above and below. On balance, black has the advantage on the right side.

White's move would have been better at D, to remove this weakness. Black's best play now is at E, to make a moyo on the right side, so that when white invades, he can make territory by attacking the invading group]

C[K- white's marked stones are now in great danger. They can probably be saved (staring with white A or B), but black will get compensation in the lower right corner.]
