AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[In this game, I (7k) played against a 2d player with 9 stone handicap.  I thought my opening was mostly okay (with one exception at move 10), but during the middle game, I felt like I let areas that should have been mine slip through my fingers.

I have sprinkled comments in where I had some thoughts about how I could have played differently.  However, I have a feeling there are better moves out there that for whatever reason I'm unable to imagine.

I would really appreciate some suggestions about areas or skills to work on.  Thanks!


Ok.
I'll try to review the game usefully.
Before anything, you may or not be aware of the purpose of the handicap stones :
On the contrary of a common belief, handicap stones are not meant to provide territorry bases, but to ease attack situation for black.
Territory is a by-product of attack.];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[df]
;W[md];B[jf]TR[oc][hd]C[I don't like this. 
More experienced players could object to my view, but I find that this move does not put any pressure on white.
Neither does it secure territory.

So, I would prefer H16 at a vital white point, or P17, which claims the corner while cutting off any white base on the top.

let white play K14 : your K16 stone can be sacrified for bigger purposes.]
;W[pc];B[qd]TR[qc]C[somewhat too easy for white.
Put pressure with R17];W[qc]
(;B[oc]C[I think this move is a mistake, after W cuts at P16, this stone will have a hard time living.  Perhaps better to play at P16, let W get the corner and upper right side, and build B wall facing down towards the right side?

No, this move is okay for me, but it is dangerous because of N16.
The principle with handicap is that you have helping stones for fight. So keep the fighting spirit and separate white.

This is the most important at handicap games : KEEP WHITE STONES SEPARATED]
;W[od]
(;B[rc]TR[nc]C[No, you cannot sacrifice your cutting stone. It's too important.
So the only move is O17.

No problem. Your idea is good. Follow it];W[ce];B[de];W[cf]

The idea is good anyway.
It's good fighting spirit, and even if it does not fully work, you should get something in compensation]
;W[co];B[do];W[bn];B[dm]C[No, connect solidly.

Yes !!
