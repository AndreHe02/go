Please comment for black.
I try to make variants, which I later consider as better.
Please tell me where my analysis is incorrect
Thank you.

A:
I'm Andre and I'll do my best to review your game.  I do not see any questions so I'll review on some events only.

Because I study most on opening as I believe that a good opening will help much at middle game to set up spot, I'll spend most time on opening. I won't give you an example of a complicated battle as i'm not too good on it, you should ask to a more experienced player.]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[pq];W[pd];B[nc]TR[cf][dp][pq]C[A:
Is black afraid of san-ren-sei? I believe the best attack for black is on C14, attack at O17 now is too early. Black has an advantage of moving first (Sente), there is no need of making jumpy moves.

D4 and Q3 stones needed one more stone to balance their power that is on around C14, but I believe D14 will not be answered. Black can play a shimari too.

"Keep sente in the opening. A premature attack loses sente."]
;W[qf];B[pb];W[qc];B[kc]C[A:
Black loses his sente at 9th move.];W[qo]LB[dd:4][qj:2][oo:3]
[op:1]C[A:
White aiming either an attack to K4 territory or building a huge moyo around R10. I calculate that R10 moyo is larger than K4 but White already has a structure at upperleft corner so attacking will be hard.

Black got 4 choices here:
1. Defend at P4 and attack which you choose
2. Attack at R9 and have a tough fight.
3. Attack and defense at Q5, I will cover this in a variation.
4. Play elsewhere to test White's reaction. My suggestion is to attack  D16 stone.]

(;B[op]C[A:
This move's fokus on defense.];W[ql]C[A:
White loses sente, now is black's chance to increase his territory. Take a closer look at the board.

White has 1 secure area and has potential to center and 1 stand alone D16 stone that is waiting to attacked. While Black hs 1 secured area too with little potential to the center and a huge territory will be if you know how to create one.

The fact is you can attack D16 or securing lower area. You can do it both if you know how. It depends on how white's reaction. If he has a defend instinct than go attack D16 at D14, if he has an all out offensive mindset, shimari at D6, or he is a balanced type, he might after K4 or D10 depending on which point you choose to attack.]

(;B[fc]C[A:
Among all alternatives, black chooses to attack D16, the best way to attack D16 is from C15 position, because black already has a stronghold at L17, C14 may lead into a joseki typical of what I described before since its the best white's answer for that situation.]

F15 is better and it's building influence.];W[ec];B[hb]C[A:
This is indeed an atari but not important, only worth 3 points at most or 2 points only to be exact.]
;W[fq]C[A:
Actually this is a difficult situation for black. As he has 3 weak spots.

If the attack at upper right is succeeded or you make a shimari at C6, you can play at D3 to pressure him. But in this case, it's better to fight as black has disadvantage here. I suggest using the loose arrack joseki by playing at J3.]

(;B[dn]C[A:
This move is false as this move giving away lower left's territory. What black needs now is both territory and influence wchich he can build it together by playing D6 shimari or closing the corner at D3, forcing him to make safe territory at J3.]

(;W[dr];B[cq];W[iq];B[lq];W[rq]

What's the point of doing this move ? Black R11 put himslf into attack, if it made territory, it eill be a small one, instead, why not at Q11 and grab some influence.]

;W[hk];B[gl];W[gk];B[hl];W[jk]C[A:
If I'm white, I'll play at different point. E10 will definitely connect to E17 dragon, killing C17 in effect.]

(;B[km]TR[cc][ej]C[A:
Black is playing cautiously. What should black do at this moment ? Let's take a good look at the board.

White E10 worm is not connected yet, meanwhile C17 is weak. I suggest cutting E10 from D18 group while strengthening your C17 stone. See variation.]

(;B[qh]C[A:
This is krv's suggested move.

This move is extremely bad, White already has 3 stone securing upper left's corner and black wish to attack directly.

This is what would happen...

Note:
If you want to attack, place a stone at around R10. See variations.]
;W[qk]C[A:
Now R12 is under attack while at the sametime R5 got strengthen and Q3 is in danger of living in small.]
;B[oh]C[A:
This is the usual escape move. This move'spurpose is to move into center and seeking help to O17 group. White might ignore this move and play somewhere else that Black must answer then play at O14 to pursue Black. The result is black may survive but R16 and R9 group got strengthen.]
;W[of];B[mh];W[ok])
(;B[qk]TR[np][op][nq]C[A:
This move's fokus is on attack but white will ignore it and attack Q3 then attack R9. But R9 move is a Joseki so you just do the required joseki and you'll both do fine. Well, your homework is to find the best joseki for this situation, my hint is that Murase Shuho Honinbo covers this at his books on Joseki. The same goes if black put the stone at R10 but R10 is tough coz it's closer to R14 group which may lead to unexpected situation.

The triangle mark is white's possible best moves at lower right corner.BUT if white is an experience player, he might consider attacking at D4 stone first which is weak to test your way of thinking then attack Q3 while defending R5 at the same time.]
)
(;B[oo]C[A:
This is what i called attack and defense at the same time. Most high 2 digit kyu players will defend at either Q6 or Q7 while low digit kyu players may put a stone at N3, sacrificing R5 stone in order to gain larger territory that is Black's. The result is depending on Black's decision at either sacrifice his territory or protect. But the choice to sacrifice is difficult because of O17 fault. without white's R14, exchanging territory has benefits of having a potential blow (aji).]
