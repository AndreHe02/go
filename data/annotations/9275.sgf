C[higil [3k\]: hi
Tokee [3k\]: hi good game


Hello dear viewer!
Thank you for reviewing (before I forget that)!!

You can review for me in english, german, spanish
- depending what is the most comfortable for you.

I have so many questions for this game.
I probably will learn, how to better read.
Also, still with using all my time
- sometimes I don´t know how to play strategically.

And I feel like basics are missing.

Sidenote: I am also on SL
Check out my go humor :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[qj]
;B[qg];W[qm]LB[ql:A]C[I am very comfortable with my first 3 stones
( I play them often)

R13 is rather new for me, I used to play R8
So my idea here is to "cramp" him, making him a bit
crowded with all my stones.

Is this here better or A?

CG: Well, looking at professional games, you'll notice that both moves have been played by professionals, but A is the most common move.
This usually means that in an amateur game both moves are ok.]
;B[jd]LB[cf:A]TR[ob]C[I feel like...

Is this too greedy AND passive at the same time?

maybe better C14-approach?
Also, for white - I would maybe even invade at 3-3.

Well, later he will invade here (at the triangle).

Also, after looking at this after the game,
I know why I play on the 4th line here.
Probably too much sanrensei games before.

CG: I would play F17 in this position, but I can't say K16 is a bad move.]
;W[jp]TR[qj][qm]C[I feel now like B is a bit better off.
The bottom side is not so much worth, is it?

And also, how would I build up pressure on the 2 right stones?

CG: I agree, the left side is more important for white. Regarding the two white stones: You can't effectively attack them with one move, and you can't tell in which direction you want them to move. So just wait and play on the left side.]
;B[cj]C[CG: Good.];W[ob]TR[jc]C[I just can´t play to unconventional moves.
(unconv. to me)

So maybe I made it much too easy for him.
Still... no idea where to play.

Would his invasion still be good if I played the k-stone
on the 3rd line?];B[nc]LB[pb:C][oc:B][pc:A]TR[jd][pd]C[CG: This is a strange answer. You don't need to connect the marked stones, do you? You can't expect to get much territory on the outside, so you should defend the corner while chasing the white stone against K16. Among the "usual" answers A-C I would choose A here: It does not help white to make shape and is the best attacking move. Your answer makes it too easy for white to settle himself in the corner.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[CG: Pressing into a knight move is bad style and actually helps white by removing the aji of Q18. Just play R16.]
;W[pb];B[qd];W[rc];B[rd];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb]TR[qg]C[CG: Now your marked stone is too close to your wall, so white has gained locally.]
;B[fc]C[CG: Good.];W[fd]C[CG: White should answer at C14.];B[ec]
;W[ed];B[gc];W[dc];B[db]LB[cf:A]C[CG: Wrong direction. You should rather play at A to "attack" the white stones. Of course you can't capture them, but you will get a comfortable posion on the left side. The top is not of much value any more.]
;W[cb];B[eb];W[lc];B[ld]C[CG: This just helps white as you are pushing him in the direction of your weaker stones ...]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[ib]C[CG: ... forcing you to play another move now!]
;B[gd]LB[dh:A][ej:B]TR[bb][cf]C[I knew I played this sequence wrong somehow.
Was g16 a must?

Becaus right now, I would have liked to approach
his wall very cautiously. D12 maybe.
OR playing e10 even, to later have miai.



Till here are my most important questions.
Feel free to comment more - for example, if I could get 2 points somewhere in the endgame :)

CG: I think you have to play G16 now, and M16 is the move to blame.
To attack the white stones (which are not as strong as they might look, I would aim at the marked points. Among your choices, B looks almost ok, but I A looks very weird ... If C14 looks too dangerous, play C13 instead ...]
;W[ch]C[CG: Good!];B[ej];W[eh]C[CG: Bad. It does not really make sense to try to get much territory in the upper left, so C7 looks more natural.]
;B[gf]C[CG: For you, C6 is the urgent move ...];W[gh];B[eg]
;W[dg];B[fh]C[CG: I don't understand this move ...]
(;W[fi]C[... nor white's answer! I can't see any reason not to play F13.]

;B[qi];W[pj];B[pi];W[ok];B[oi];W[nk];B[pl];W[pk]C[CG: A bad answer - white has to play R8.]
;B[ql];W[rl];B[rk];W[rm];B[rj];W[qk];B[on]C[CG: How did you manage to loose after this?]
;W[po]
(;B[qo]C[CG: Instead of capturing a part of the group in bad shape, you should rather play at P5 (and probably kill the whole group).]
