C[Hello,

I was asked to review your game. My name is Bart and i'm a 11k from Belgium. I hope i can help you. But i don't know everything about go, and certainly not about how and when attacking. I'll tell you what i think is correct, but a 1dan player can say other things.
I think that you made mistakes, but u made more important mistakes than in fighting, i'll try to help u...

greetings Bart

Hello,

This game was played on KGS. I (StealthB 30k) was white. I thought I was  winning but then it turns out I lost by a few, and I would like to know what  I could have done better. Especially some tips on when to attack and when to  defend would be helpful.

Thanks in advance,
Emily];B[pd]C[The first part of the game: fuseki and joseki. the four four point is a possible move. A move on the fourth line stresses influence, a move on the third line stresses territory.( That doesn't mean that you will keep it). The four four point stresses influence to both sides, and an invasion at the 3-3 point is still possible. it is a good move. The most common opening points are 4-4 and 3-4. Also 3-3 is often. More rare is the 5-3 and 5-4 point (but these are not bad, but not usual). And 5-5, 6-3,6-4, 7-7,... also exist, but are very rare. a good thing for joseki, is the 'kogo's joseki dictionary' you can get it on demand via e-mail. Very interesting.]
;W[pq]LB[qp:a]C[also a good move. There are theories on which people decide to play this or a in a certain corner.]
;B[dd];W[cp]C[i don't know something to say about this. I don't think it is bad. It is not my style (but i should try some more in my games).]
;B[jd]C[very defensive move. But nothing wrong with it.];W[kp]
LB[ip:a][iq:b]C[good idea. you want  influence at an area that u can compare with black's area. I think it is better to play a or b. The reason is that you leave a big space now on the left. So an invasion is easier. You will think: but then i leave the right side open. That is true, but an invasion is harder there because your corner stone is closer.]
;B[qo]C[common opening.];W[oo]C[u use your center stone. This move is not that common in opening. But i don't know a reason why it should be wrong.]
;B[pm]C[good idea.];W[om]LB[cf:a][qf:b][qh:c][gq:d][gp:e]C[i don't feel good about this. It only pushes black along the fourth line, which gives him lots of territory... I think about attacking yourself with a for example. or with b (this might be harder because of the pincer at c, which treatens to make a big territory on the right, but i'm not sure.)
u can also defend your big gap below with d (or with e)...]
;B[ol]C[is a good move];W[nm]C[correct];B[nl]C[black is gaining influence on the right side...]
;W[cf]C[good];B[ch]C[Oshiro [?\]: pincer move( yep the pincer move)]
;W[dh]LB[ef:a]C[i wouldn't play that, i would play a. But i looked it up in the 'kogo's joseki dictionary, and they say a is bad. so you seem to be correct...]
;B[di];W[eh]C[again, correct for the 'kogo joseki dictionary', seems strange to me]
;B[cg]C[you seem to be reading the kogo's joseki dictionary...]
;W[df]C[yep];B[cm]C[ha, black hasn't continued the joseki's. I wouldn't like to play this as white, because it involves complicated fights to survive i believe... But i'm not a proffesianal off course. Black played a rather good move...]
;W[dn]LB[dm:a][cn:b]C[the shoulder hit here , is aiming for the lower left side as territory. normally black extends by one of the two sides (a or b)]
;B[dm]C[and he does, so what next? also extend!, u are making the influence on your lower side stronger.]
;W[en]C[correct];B[bo]C[small move];W[ek]LB[ei:a]C[the idea is ok (i think you try to connect your groups (always good), but i don't know if it works.. what do u do after a for example? I don't know..]
;B[dk]C[he is gentil.];W[ej];B[dj];W[em]C[it is very kind of him. Your problem is solved.]
;B[dq]LB[fp:a][fq:b][cq:c]C[yep, was to be expected. I think the best response is a (or b), you don't give him much territory, and he is attacked, c is also possible.]
;W[dp]C[you are connected for sure now, but he will make a group there, taking territory.]
;B[eq]C[into the open, good idea];W[gp]LB[gq:a][cq:b]C[a was better i think, don't give him the space to make eyes, b is in the same idea, but has to follow later.]
;B[gq]C[he is getting a good base for a group, and u are losing the biggest territory u had]
;W[hp]LB[hq:a]C[Oshiro [?\]: being passive again, if i cut into your territory, you gotta attack

Yes he is correct, but now playing a is to dangerous for cutting points. the mistake was made earlier. now this is the best u can do (u have to give up the lower left...)]
;B[hq]C[well played];W[nh]LB[ph:a][pg:b][qf:c][md:d][nc:e]C[wow. I think this is showing you are very desperate. i think black is very happy. He is allowed to make territory on the right with a, and u are to far from the upper side to invade from here...  I understand the meaning, u want to do something about the black territory that is over there... (which is a good idea) But if u want to do it, attack it by invading immediately.  b, c, d or e for example, u can run into the open to your friends in the center if they attack u...]
;B[og]LB[ph:a]C[He is attacking you. But there is a strange thing in go. If u want to attack, u better do it from a distance (because when you attach, he can use your stone to built up strength...). A was better]
;W[mf]C[i don't know...];B[me]LB[md:a]C[a was better];W[nf]
C[this is better i think, it is making shape..];B[oe]C[not bad.]
;W[ke]LB[le:a][ne:b]C[this is a bit far. it is easy to cut. I think a was better. It treatens to cut at b... it is a difficult variation, and a hard fighting, but i think (have teh feeling) it is better. I'm not sure]
;B[le];W[kf]LB[lf:a]C[a was better because this has a very dangerous variation for white. see the variation]

(;B[lf];W[lg];B[ng]C[u are lucky he doesn't see it];W[mh]C[I don't understand why u don't connect... u might have been right..]
;B[mg];W[kg];B[lm]LB[ml:a]C[ok, u created a certain territory in teh center, so he wants to destroy it. I think it was best ti cut. At a. I think he doesn't have much to do against it]

(;W[ln]C[is defensive (and it defends good!), but too passive]
;B[kn];W[ko]LB[mn:a]C[a was better];B[mn]C[because of this]
;W[lo];B[nn];W[on];B[mm];W[no];B[jn];W[fd]C[Good. you could have done it earlier also...]
;B[hc];W[hd]LB[fc:a]C[i beleive u have to push trough now and try to take the corner. a is a splendid move]
;B[fc]C[now black makes a territory on the upperside..];W[fe]
;B[ee];W[ef];B[ed];W[jj]C[good idea, u try to make territory, but there are some gaps in it, which can cost u lots of points...]
;B[jp];W[jq];B[iq];W[ip];B[jo];W[lq]LB[kq:a]C[I believe it is better to connect at a. It is more solid, and doesn't leave danger...]
;B[mo];W[mp];B[qq]C[good move];W[po]C[also good];B[pn];W[ir]
LB[km:a]C[yeah not bad. but i think, there was a better move. a for example. I think u can take the 4 stones, and a big territory]
;B[hr];W[js]LB[jr:a]C[auch, this leaves lots of danger. a is more solid, and safer.]
;B[kr]C[StealthB [30k?\]: hey! ;)
Oshiro [?\]: nah, that was a bad move now that i think about it
StealthB [30k?\]: why?
Oshiro [?\]: play K2

That is the danger i meant...];W[jr]C[Oshiro [?\]: yah, in a capture race, you would win
StealthB [30k?\]: ok];B[pr]C[Oshiro [?\]: what Im doing to your bottom right corner you can do to my upper left
StealthB [30k?\]: now? Or should I respond to you first?
Oshiro [?\]: respond first];W[qp];B[rp];W[pp];B[rr];W[or];B[ps]
;W[os];B[rn];W[oq]LB[lr:a]C[I think this was not necessary, a was more urgent.]
;B[ep]C[good move];W[eo]C[this is also good, but you were already connected.]
;B[fp];W[fo]C[take care of the 3 white stones of the right of it.]
;B[co];W[do];B[cn]C[this was not urgent at all];W[cd]C[good move]
;B[ec]LB[cc:a]C[wow, he is afraid, take the corner. with a, it is worth at least 10 points.]
;W[gc]C[not bad either];B[gb];W[gd];B[dg];W[eg];B[ei];W[fi]
;B[el];W[fl];B[dl];W[ic]LB[hb:a][fb:b]C[what about a, (he extends where you played), and then b?]
;B[hb];W[kc];B[lc];W[kd];B[ld]
(;W[jc]LB[kb:a]C[this is a bit passive. a was better i believe, black could not get out...]
;B[ib];W[mk]LB[ml:a]C[correct, but why not cutting at a?it would hurt him more. (i think the variations shown a couple of moves ago still work...)]
;B[ml]C[black is happy];W[nk];B[ok]
(;W[oi]LB[oh:a]C[a threatens more. U can make use of the two white stones then (see var 2)]
;B[pi]LB[qc:a][cq:b][cc:c][jb:d]C[black can make territory. I think it might be the time to play the san-san (three-three point) invasion. It mostly works. The advantage is a living group. The disadvantage is influence on the outside for the enemy. As black has already influence on the outside  you have nothing to loose.
If u could cut through on the right side it would also be great. (but i don't think that works)
so we have a. But also b(corner), c(corner), d (cutting) are good moves.]
;W[hs];B[gs]LB[kq:a]C[oops. just play a, and it is over for white]
;W[fr]C[Oshiro [?\]: lol];B[gr]C[StealthB [30k?\]: its funny?
Oshiro [?\]: no, just its similar to what i did

Yeah, but he didn't finished his chance (lol)];W[fq];B[is];W[fs]
C[perfect];B[er];W[hs];B[es]C[not necessary, he doesn't get out anyway, minus one point for black]
;W[cq]C[not bad];B[cr];W[cs];B[bq];W[br];B[bp];W[dr];B[kb];W[ds]
LB[jb:a][cc:b]C[this was not necessary, he couldn't get out anyway. But the win of the bottom side (well played) gives u a chance to win the game. U had better cutted at a. He has to fight for the life of his group. B was even better.  It treatens to kill th group if he does not connect. So u gain lots of points.]
;B[il]C[ok, he wants to destroy territorry];W[hk];B[hm];W[in]
;B[io];W[hn];B[im];W[jk];B[jl];W[ik];B[kk]C[u defend quite well]
;W[lj];B[lk];W[mj];B[kj];W[ki];B[gl];W[gk];B[fm];W[fk];B[gn]
;W[ho];B[oh];W[ph];B[qh]LB[pj:a]C[he is afraid. A would have sealed it off effectively]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qi]C[very well played];B[qg];W[pj];B[pf];W[pi]
;B[qk];W[pk];B[pl]C[great, u might win the game];W[oj]LB[ri:a]

;W[qj];B[rl];W[sj];B[qm];W[sl];B[rm];W[qk];B[sm];W[sk];B[sh]
LB[cc:a]C[this costed him a lot. and now a, is the game i think.]
;W[bg]LB[cc:a]C[not a bad idea, only it is worth only 6 or 8 points. A is more than 10 points so a]
;B[bh];W[bf];B[ar]LB[cc:a]C[this is only one point. and he cannot even give atari. I keep on saying it. The biggest is a. let us show the difference var 2 when white plays, var 3 when black plays

black in the one case 25 points, in the other 13 points, so it is a difference of 12 points.
White in the one case 3 points, in the other 13 points, so a difference of 10 points.
In total it gives 22 points... I can't do it in my head (pro's can) but it was very big at this moment in the game...]

(;W[bs];B[kq]C[StealthB [30k?\]: interresting

might have been interesting 50 moves earlier, now there is nothing to be afraid of...]

;B[ab];W[ad];B[bb];W[de]LB[ah:a]C[a was bigger, and it is sente (he has to react) see one of the variations above)]

Oshiro [?\]: what?
StealthB [30k?\]: no wait. its attached
StealthB [30k?\]: heh. nevermind];W[af];B[ah];W[be]C[not necessary, white is connected, so this costs you one point]
;B[jb]C[and he earns 5 or six points with this, so this was much better]
;W[ls]C[this is playing on safety, but i don't think it was really necessary]
;B[aq]C[StealthB [30k?\]: phone. one sec];W[fn];B[gm];W[hl]
;B[km]LB[go:a][kl:b]C[this was necessary once, if u filled a, then he had to do something, because b and the played stone would be double atari...]
;C[Oshiro [?\]: close
StealthB [30k?\]: sigh. still lost
Oshiro [?\]: hehe, when you took the bottom right, i had to attack the middle hard
StealthB [30k?\]: ok.
Oshiro [?\]: errr bottom left
StealthB [30k?\]: mind if I send this into the teaching ladder?
Oshiro [?\]: go for it
StealthB [30k?\]: thanks. :) Anyways, that's enough go for me today. My brain will fall out if I play more
StealthB [30k?\]: thanks for the games :)
