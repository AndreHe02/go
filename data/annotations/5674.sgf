C[takeomark [19k\]: hi
deinos [18k\]: hi
Deinos: Hello, I am looking for advice for a relatively new player on improving my tactics, understanding what big mistakes did I make, and how can I improve analysis? I play as white and lose by over 50.  I will proceed my comments with a D.  Thank you for your time.

K- hi, thanks for sending this game in review. My comments are marked with a K]
;B[dd];W[qo]C[K- unusual move these days but plenty of examples historically]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[jc];W[cj];B[qj]
(;W[pp]LB[nq:A]C[K- playing in this area is fine, but this stone is too close to the one next to it. By that I mean, it neither encloses the corner, nor increases your influence up the right side, nor prevents a black approach to the corner (at A).

See variations];B[cf];W[dg]MA[je][ej][oj]LB[jj:3][pk:4][jp:1]
[jq:2]C[D: instead of bolstering at k4 or k3 to secure the side, I decide to try testing his defense.  I think now in retrospect I was just following his move and end up making him stronger.  perhaps I should be engaging his stone at R10?  Or would that just make a weak stone stronger?  Perhaps I should instead be trying to stake a claim to the center?

K- I agree with you that this is not the biggest move available.

Looking at the whole board, 3 of the sides have stones on the 3rd line below the star points. Stones in these positions are always vulnerable to a capping move, so the points marked 'x' are all worth looking at. 

In this case, the cap on the left side strengthens your position but does not apply pressure to black. The cap at the top would be very isolated so it might be best to establish a presence in the centre first. The cap on the right side looks like the best move to me.]
;B[cg];W[eg];B[jj]TR[jc][pd][qj]C[D: this is  a big move for B, I can tell, due to the moyo of the 4 marked stones...

K- true, but his stones on the sides would be better placed on the 4th line if he wants a central moyo.]
;W[jp]TR[dp][pp]LB[oj:A]C[K- black's stone on the central point makes this not a great move, for 2 reasons.

First, look at how the stones exert influence over the lower half of the board. Your 3 stones on the star points of the lower side (marked with triangles) form a sanrensei pattern. The characteristics of this pattern are that it is NOT territorial (the lower side and both corners can easily be invaded) however it forms a flexible framework for using the opponent's invasion to build up territory and/or influence. This flexibility means that whatever the opponent does, you can use it to your advantage. However, in this case black has a stone on the central point, which means that your ability to use the sanrensei to build influence is greatly reduced. Therefore your sanrensei has lost its flexibility, which means it is not a good pattern to play in this situation.

The second reason for not playing in this area is to do with a different area of the board, the top right. It is now a priority for you to prevent black solidifying his moyo. You should plan to play reducing moves such as the capping moves I mentioned before, and follow these up with a corner invasion.

So where should you play now? I suggest the cap at A.];B[mj]
;W[pg]C[D: I invade because I recognize that if I do nothing, he will own a quarter of the board due to the moyo

K- strategically, you are correct. Tactically, this is an unusual choice of invasion point. Being on the 4th line it is biased towards influence and/or connecting outwards to friendly stones... but in this case there are none nearby. It would be more usual to invade on the 3rd line if you want to make life locally.

That does not mean this move is wrong, it depends on your plan. Maybe this stone is a placement or a probe, which are perfectly legitimate tactics.]
;B[qf];W[ng]LB[oj:A]C[D: I realize I cannot build a base of support on the right side, so I run out to the center... Dont want to go too slow, but not yet willing to give up the stone at Q13 yet either.

K- since this is an area where black is strong and you are weak, you need to play lightly here. I suggest A]
;B[of];W[lg];B[jg]C[D: Trapped inside, now I will have to fight for life here...]
;W[ld];B[nf];W[mf];B[og];W[ne];B[nh];W[oc]C[K- good, you are playing lightly and black is not - it is looking promising that you will make life]
;B[pc];W[od];B[oe];W[ob];B[pb];W[pa]LB[na:1][lb:3][nb:2]C[D: this is probably small and gote, perhaps wrapping back at 1 or 2, or defending at M18?

K- you are right it is small, but it is not gote. 1 & 2 would be poor but 3 is a good move, making eyespace and threatening to undercut the top edge]
;B[qa];W[oa];B[qb];W[md]C[D: I still haven't addressed the weakness at m18, but this move appears to at least defend against the cut at N15 or O16 at the same time.]
;B[mg];W[lc]TR[ld][md]MA[mc]LB[lb:A]C[K- have you heard the phrase "empty triangle"? it refers to the shape made by the 3 marked stones when there is no enemy stone at 'x' (if there was, it would not be an EMPTY triangle). An empty triangle is almost always a bad shape to make - there is usually an alternative move nearby that achieves the same purpose but makes better use of the stones. In this case it would be the point you have already mentioned, A.]
;B[kc];W[kb];B[jb];W[ka];B[ja];W[lb];B[lf];W[ke]C[D: A silly move, but trying to defend the larger territory and continue to reach out.  the shape looks strongly alive so I want to quickly start reaching out and get to other territories.

K- nothing silly about this move, it is perfectly good for the reasons you say]
;B[me];W[nd];B[le];W[kd];B[jf]C[D: and at this point, W is contained.  Now what?

K- now you should play elsewhere, however see variation for a (gote) continuation you can use later]

(;W[ie]C[K- nice... simple but effective];B[je]
(;W[dm]C[K- ?? see variation!];B[gd];W[gf]LB[ie:2][eg:1][dq:A]
C[D: I realize this is slow, but I'm trying to defend against a good invasion point at G14, evenly spaced between the stones at 1 and 2.

K- I don't think you need to worry about black playing there. Personally, I would expect black to start invading your sanrensei very soon (next move perhaps?), so I would play something like A to make it hard for him]
;B[hh];W[gj];B[hj];W[gh];B[gi];W[fi];B[hi];W[gg];B[fj];W[gk]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[dj];W[di];B[fk]
(;W[gl]C[D: This appears to help save the stones at G9 and G10, but now its a matter of trying to deny life to B's stones at F10.

K- see variation - the ladder is in your favour so you can attack more directly]
;B[el];W[fm];B[dl]
(;W[ck]C[K- see variation];B[cl]C[D: oops, he got out.];W[cm]
;B[bk];W[ci];B[bm];W[cn];B[dk]C[D: still looks killable, but...]
;W[bj];B[bn];W[al];B[bl];W[ak];B[am];W[aj];B[bo]C[D: he lives quite comfortably.]
;W[ao];B[bp];W[cq];B[bq];W[ql]TR[ci]LB[bh:A][jl:1][ml:2]C[D: This appears slow and small, I should likely have been looking at 1 or 2.

K- 1 is good because it uses the wall you have just built, however the marked group is vulnerable to attack so you need to play a move such as A before long]
;B[em];W[en];B[co];W[dn];B[do];W[eo];B[ep];W[fp];B[eq];W[gp]
TR[cm][dm][cn]LB[dn:A][eo:B]C[D: There has to have been a better way for me to defend against this cut...

K- the stone you played at A should have been at B, sacrificing the 3 marked stones. Remember, any sacrifice that gives you sente (from when the opponent plays the move to capture) can be very beneficial]
;B[dq];W[fq];B[fr];W[gr];B[er];W[kk]LB[ml:A]C[D: shoulder hit against a stone, better placements available perhaps a bit further back?

K- I think A looks best];B[nl]C[D: ouch, thats a good placement.  Now W is in trouble and must run to defend.]
;W[nk];B[ll];W[lk];B[mk]C[K- good invasion by black];W[ml];B[mm]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[km];B[ln];W[ok];B[ol];W[pk];B[pl];W[qk];B[pj]
;W[oi]C[D: Stab in the dark, and not likely able to do anything strong.  Stone at Q13 is weak.]
;B[oj];W[nj];B[ni];W[ph];B[pi];W[oh];B[qh];W[qg];B[rg];W[br]
C[D: Here I was wondering if by a ko threat it would be possible to kill his group at B5.

K- no harm in trying :-)];B[cr];W[lp];B[pn];W[nn];B[qm];W[rm]
;B[rn];W[sl];B[rk]C[D: B killed me dead here.  Fairly impactful loss, too, since this now affects the whole right side.]

;W[hl];B[jo];W[io];B[ko];W[kp];B[fe]MA[cc][jd]C[D: play starts on the final unsettled area, his move first, and I'm not sure how to invade properly.

K- you have 2 ways in, marked with 'x'. You should go for the corner first, and if you can keep sente, go for the other]
;W[ee];B[ed];W[de]C[D: bamboo shape here meant to keep a connection and push into his territory...

K- problem is, it is making him stronger and not making you any points]
;B[ce]TR[ed][de][ee]C[K- you can see that the exchange of these 2 white stones for these 2 black stones was better for black]
;W[cd]C[D: a silly cut that seems to help B even more.];B[cc]

K- this game was closer than the final score suggests. There were a few missed opportunities (moves 74, 114, 178) where things could easily have gone your way.

In terms of overall suggestions, the only thing I would suggest you try to do differently is to avoid making empty triangles. It is so rarely the right thing to do that if you never allow yourself to play an empty triangle ever again, the benefit will far outweigh the drawbacks.

I hope my comments have been useful to you. Please feel free to email me if you would like further discussion, or look me up on Dragon if you would like a game (www.dragongoserver.net , user name 'kester')]
