C[[ZD\] Hi; I will mark my comments this way.

refocus [6k\]: hi
HELLO! I am black (refocus) in this game.
i have returned to playing go after a 5 year hiatus and am eagear to tyr improving.
 Thanks so much for looking over my game!!];B[pq];W[pd];B[dd]
C[I chose to cross cut, mainly out of curiosity for the game that would develop.]
;W[dp];B[pn]LB[po:A]C[[ZD\] This enclosure is a bit nonstandard; it is not wrong, but A would give a more solid group and avoid complications.]
;W[ql]
(;B[pl]LB[qj:B][pl:A]C[Im not sure about this move. WOuld pincering be better? or extending along the bottom?

[ZD\] Pincer in this situation is not favorable, since white holds the upper right corner.  See the variation.  Extending on the bottom is possible.]
;W[qm]
(;B[qn]LB[qn:A]C[[ZD\] Given that your moves so far were influence-oriented, A seems a bit inconsistent.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[pk];B[ol];W[ok]LB[qk:A]C[[ZD\] This may be an overplay, cut at A is severe.]
;B[nk];W[nj]
(;B[mk];W[mj];B[lk];W[qj];B[jp]C[I left cutting points but thought  that white having this move would be too painful.

[ZD\] In any case, white gained a lot in this exchange.];W[jn]
LB[fq:B][gq:A]C[is this an over play for white?

[ZD\] No; this is a fairly conservative reduction.  The move is too small now, though. A or B would be better.]

I didnt want to get shut in at the top, but decided the stone escaping witha ladder breaking was worse.

Thanks so much for Reviewing!!!!

[ZD\] The outcome in the lower left corner favored white greatly.  Also, allowing to be closed in the upper right corner was a big mistake.  In the endgame, white missed some good opportunities, and both players overestimated the importance of the points in the center.]
