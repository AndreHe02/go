Hello,
It has been fun reviewing the game. I've made my best guess on good variations for you.
Please feel free to ask questions. You can contact me at: paul.ohmart@gmail.com.
Paul];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jq];W[qj]C[I think R10 is a move to prevent they connect with good shape.

Yes, good move.];B[qm];W[qf];B[md]LB[qh:A]TR[qf][qj]C[Black plays N16 and K10 that I feel really annoyed as White is still easy to had had invasion .

No need to be annoyed. The marked stones are in B's sphere of influence and are 3 spaces apart. Black can aim at an invasion at A which would lead to fighting. As white I would not like to fight where black is stronger so I would defend immediately.]

(;W[dj]TR[md][jq]C[So , I play this move without thinking and idea .

The two marked black stones limit your ability to make a moyo on the left side. If I were to play in this area I might try C10 to be more territory oriented. But, this is not a move that will win or loose the game.]
;B[cg]C[Would be better on the upper side.]
(;W[fc]C[I want to attack top right corner later on .];B[bj]
C[This is an interesting move to deal with and I'm not sure what the correct way to handle it is.
I'll do a little thinking out loud.]
