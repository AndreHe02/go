C[Llywelyn: Hey brandon, This is my first review in awhile, so hopefully I don't screw up too badly.  As an aside, I'm going to use a lot of japanese terms here because I am learning them myself, so please don't be intimidated! If you can't remember them don't worry about it :)

My main recommendations for you are to:

1) Study a few basic joseki from the 4-4 (hoshi) point and the 3-4 (komoku) points.  Specifically the knights-approach to both.  If you then play these points consistently in your fuseki your game will improve by several stones just like that.

2) Don't throw stones where they aren't needed.  There are a couple of times where you overplay and put stones where you don't need them.

3) Don't leave severe weaknesses before you move on.  In the beginning and middle of the game you can play faster/weaker shapes, but you shouldn't leave an easily exploitable weakness (such as move 207) when you move to another region.

On a side note, I'd recommend turning up the strength of the computer to the regular setting and giving yourself a handicap (say 7-9 stone to start).  It will give you a better game and a better measure of your progress.

Hopefully this helps and I didn't make too many mistakes :-)

[rb][sh][pe][ng][pi][nf][kj][sf][oj][pd][sj][oh]C[Llywelyn: This move is slightly informal.  The marked moves are more traditional, though there is nothing wrong with your stone placement.]
;W[pd];B[de]TR[dd][dc][cd]C[I don't really understand fuseki or joseki well ye

Llywelyn:  For openings if you are a beginner its best to stick with the hoshi (4-4) and komoku (3-4) points.  The tamamoku (5-4 point, what you played) is a very difficult point for most newbies since its very heavily influence oriented.  There are also a lot of trick plays that stem off of it, making it a bit complicated to deal with.]
;W[co]C[Llywelyn: For the record this point is called mokuhazushi (5-3) and is another influence oriented point, similar to your last above.]

(;B[ep]LB[dq:A]C[Llywelyn: A fairly good approach.  "Use the knight's move to attack, the one-point jump to defend."   This move abandons territory in the corner to keep white from building influence.  "A" presents the better option that strikes a balance.

I've included a variation of an approach in the opposite corner.  The variation is not meant to detract from the strength of this move or playing in this corner, but to show a joseki I think you should study.]

(;B[dp]C[Llywelyn: Here you are helping white reinforce her position without getting anything out of the deal.  This is a very vulgar move.]

(;W[nc]TR[cp]C[Llywelyn: White should have taken advantage of your mistake and played C4.]

(;B[od]TR[qf]C[Llywelyn: This is a poor corner approach--you are just allowing white to strengthen her position for no real gain.  The  knight's attack (marked) is a more traditional and more effetive.]
;W[pm]TR[oc][cp]C[Llywelyn: White shouldn't keep ignoring your threats.]
;B[om];W[cc];B[pf];W[cp];B[cn]TR[eq]C[Llywelyn: You're taking a huge risk here.  White has the superior position and good shape.   The marked move is stronger.]
;W[gc];B[kc]TR[eq][qj][cj][mq][lc]C[Llywelyn: M17 would be a better choice since it gives you a little more room to expand with a two-space jump while putting more pressure on white's stones in the corner.   There are also better plays out there.]
;W[re];B[rf]TR[rg]C[Llywelyn: Good.  Urgent before big.  Playing S13 would have probably gotten you better results though.]
;W[qe];B[qf];W[oc];B[pl]TR[nf][oe][eq]C[Llywelyn: P17 is screaming to be taken care of (I think the marked moves would do it).   E3 needs to be taken care of as well.]
;W[lq]C[Llywelyn: Nice invasion--can run or expand to either side.]
;B[mq];W[ci];B[cl];W[iq];B[gq];W[cf]C[Llywelyn:  Nice play on white's part.  This is a well placed invasion.]

C[Llywelyn: No room in there for an invasion.  Try two spaces over at A.  


B, C, D, and E represent other possible plays.

In turn:

A: gives you a stronger shape and reinforces those stones you've already played.

B: threatens to pull your stone out, which if white tries to block you can build thickness and a good deal of center influence with. 

C (or something else in that vicinity): helps secure your large sphere of influence and make the marked white stone look very lonely.

D secures a strong base for your weak group.

E: helps your weak group escape into the center.];W[em];B[en]

[gd][ji]C[Would it have been possible for me to not allow white to have the center area they enclosed this turn

Llywelyn: Not really.  That eye though isn't a large concern (its only a couple of points).  What's more of a concern is whether you could have gotten the large dragon (a big group, marked) to live earlier.  The answer to that is yes. :-)

The only weakness to attack is really at A.  Good ko-threat, but I don't think you could save the group.]
;W[ii];B[fk];W[kk];B[li];W[lh];B[kh]C[Llywelyn: Overplay, you aren't going to be able to create a second eye for your group.]

Llywelyn:  You're wrong ;-)

The lower right and right-hand side are both spheres of influence for you, but you haven't converted them into territory yet.  White's thickness (marked) is unkillable and looms--careless play could hurt you badly there.   Your corner around the 4-4 stone is also open for an invasion (for example, at the 3-3 point).]
;B[kq]C[Llywelyn: The 3-3 point is a bigger threat.];W[qq]C[Llywelyn: This is a fairly traditional invasion that the best way to deal with it is to play to prevent it about 50-100 moves ago.]

;B[qo];W[pr];B[or];W[rp]C[Llywelyn: this move is a bit unusual.]
;B[ro];W[qr];B[sp];W[sq];B[ps]TR[so]C[Llywelyn: Here is where you screw up.  By moving on and leaving T5 as a weakness, you open yourself up to a world of pain.  This, combined with losing the dragon on the upper left, may have lost you the game.]

;B[bl]LB[af:A]TR[bg]C[Llywelyn: Overplay.  White can't get life inside of your territory and can't kill your group, so there's no need to rush in for the kill and play inside your own territory unnecessarily.

Good read on not playing A, btw.];W[af];B[ak]TR[bg]C[Llywelyn: That group posed no risk. You could have saved the point by connecting your groups.]

(;B[qf]C[The knight's move is a standard corner approach for the hoshi (4-4) point.]
;W[nd]C[Llywelyn: With the one-space jump, white is trying to expand their sphere of influence along the upper edge of the board and keep black from trapping white in.]
;B[rd]C[Llywelyn: This is a threat to white's sphere of influence.]
;W[qc]C[Llywelyn: This is white defending against black's incursion.  White effectively tightens down on her sphere of influence.]
;B[qi]C[Llywelyn: Black uses the opportunity  to grab a spot around star point and secure territory.]
;W[jc]C[Llywelyn: White expands her sphere of influence and creates an invite for fighting later on.
