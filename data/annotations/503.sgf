'a' for example, to threaten 'b' and 'c' at the same time.]

was sente against my corner

Not completely sente because of 'a', but this is also the reason

You can still probably cut white: but you have to use the weakness
of the other group. For example start with 'a' (before move 89), and
be ready to reply at 'c' when white plays 'b'. Playing 'b' directly
is also possible, and simpler.];W[lf]LB[nh:a]C[It is still time to try 'a']

wants to destroy the side, he loses sente and you can play first in
