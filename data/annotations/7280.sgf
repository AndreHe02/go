Black wins by resignation.

Jewdan: Hello. My comments are preceded by "Jewdan."

This review must be preceded with a disclaimer: I do not get the san-ren-sei. Somehow, it clashes with my playing style in such a way that, when I play against it, I either win by a huge amount by taking advantage of a silly mistake, or lose by a large amount because I do not know how to penetrate it. When I use it, the games have always been boring and short, so I gave it up a long time ago. As such, I found it difficult to review this game well. I can only hope that I had some insight for you.]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[Daniel (White) always uses hoshi because joseki's are easier.

Jewdan: This is not true. There are many nasty complications that can be thrown at the hoshi. If your primary concern for your opening moves is simplicity, you should consider the san-san.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]C[Sergio (Black) likes to play san ren sei because it's flexible and allows a game based on influence.]

[mi][ni][oi]C[Daniel responds that way because he wants to play for moyo too.

Jewdan: For this board position, I have never seen this move made in professional play. The most common move by far is to make a keima kakari against one of Black's hoshi (A). Occasionally, you see White making his own san-ren-sei (B). The problem with B is that Black could start a moyo-making race with Black 1, White 2, and Black 3. Both White and Black have surrounded a side and made a double-wing extension from a corner, but Black has made a moyo surrounding an additional thirty-five points (surrounded by and including the triangles) with which White cannot really compete. White is forced to play a game of invasion and survival, whereas Black can stomach allowing White to live while surrounding lots of territory, then reducing White before he can reinforce his side. White does not want to induce this sort of game, so the approach at A is standard.

Why might the game's move be considered inferior to B? Since it is on the third line, it is strictly territorial. The intent of the hoshi is to play an influential game, so when you have two hoshi on a side, they are almost screaming for a play like B. B, on the fourth line, works with the two hoshi to develop their influence. The game's move creates a solid framework for territory, but it immediately limits - or perhaps destroys - the potential for influence along the entire side. For example, if a standard san-san joseki is played from C through N, Black O makes a joke of White's wall. In addition to this, if Black has a stone at 1, White's hoshi is stuck trying to make territory, and it is bad at it.]

(;B[fq]C[Basic kakari attack];W[dn]LB[cl:B]C[Daniel plays fourth line because it works better with C10 than the keima extension.

Jewdan: My unqualified opinion is that it is almost always better to play the high response to the keima kakari. If you play low, it feels that the position is immediately limited and that extending from the low stone is small (a three-space extension is worth maybe eight points?). Even if the weakness of the high stone at B is exploited by the other side, the high stone is still able to be involved with the rest of the board. Here, it works beautifully with the stone at A as was mentioned.]
;B[jp]C[Basic joseki.];W[qq]C[San San because both players had a lecture in which the sensei explained this:

"If black has hoshi (Q4) with two hoshi extensions (Q10, K4), the invasion at san san is the only move white must do. Any other move is a mistake, and will probably make white lose."

Jewdan: I am fairly certain that the sensei meant WHEN it is time to play in the corner, san-san is almost always the move to play. At this time, this move is a mistake. Black's result is just too good.

Since this is the sort of board I have trouble with, I find it difficult to say what is the best move. It certainly seems that the top is the most urgent area, so I would want to play O17 or perhaps O16 (White might be able to take sente with O16), and then switch to trying to exploit the aji left at the bottom by Black's three-space oogeima. There is no doubt in my mind, though, that diving into a corner and giving Black a perfect wall when there are no other positions on the board to aid in picking the proper invasion point is wrong.]
;B[qp]C[Sergio chose that direction because both stones are at the same distance from the hoshi but the upper section is weaker.

Jewdan: I'm not sure it's weaker. The reasons I'd pick this direction instead are that Q16 is further away from Q4 than F3, and that White has strength near the F3.]

C[Standard joseki

Jewdan: Notice how the stone at Q10 simultaneously makes territory and exerts influence in the area cradled by the wall and K4. If Q10 were instead R10, this area would not be so strong, and White could reduce more.]
;W[nc]C[Basic kakari aproach];B[qf]C[Sergio did the keima extension because it works better with Q10 than the iken tobi.

Jewdan: The area at the bottom makes O15 look pretty inviting. Perhaps White should have approached at O16.]
;W[pb]
(;B[qc]C[Jewdan: This is a situation where Black can gain from playing M17 or N17 instead of R17. Black has nearly all the power on the board, and if he makes more, he will be doing quite well indeed. See the variations on this move to see what Black can do.]
;W[kc]C[Basic joseki.

Jewdan: I think Black can do better with a less commonly used joseki.]

(;B[cc]C[Sergio did the invasion thinking it was the same situation than before, but later he realized that L17 and C10 create a different situation.

Jewdan: I think this is the right move. Black cannot afford to let White take this corner, and White's result is manageable regardless of which direction he picks because both L17 and C10 are low.]

(;W[cd]C[Daniel chose this direction because, although L17 is further from the hoshi than C10, the left part is weaker.]

C[Jewdan: White has a strong left side, but Black's position is stronger. Black can more easily reduce White than White can Black. However, White has a slight territorial lead that Black can and should take care of immediately.]

(;B[ne]C[Sergio played the cap to build moyo in the left while attacking white.

Jewdan: I do not think this move does enough. It secures maybe eight points and provokes L15, which secures twelve. This means that White's lead gets larger. Perhaps directly capping at L15 is better for Black.]
;W[ke]C[White defends.];B[fo]C[Black defends

Jewdan: This move is pretty big. It eliminates the weakness at H3, gives Black about nine more points, and makes an invasion at C3 a strong possibility.]
;W[ej]C[Daniel plays that move to use the upper influence and make points with the lower stones too.

Jewdan: This seems too slow. White cannot allow Black K10 as he does; Black stands to make too much this way. White should steel himself for having his moyo ravaged and commit himself to destroying more than he loses.]
;B[jj]C[Sergio plays this way to make moyo.

Jewdan: I believe Black's lead is comfortable now.];W[jn]C[White didn't know how to attack black's moyo, and he thought that move would be acceptable.

Jewdan: It is difficult, but this move should help somewhat.]
;B[fm]C[Black tries to lock the white stone and attack the left part.]
;W[ij];B[jk]TR[fm][fo][fq]C[Jewdan: It might be better to play J9. There's more aji and harder fighting, but this line of play eliminates the three marked stones' ability to make territory.]

Jewdan: I'm sorry I couldn't help too much. I dislike the rigidity of the board that develops from the san-ren-sei, and as such, I have not studied it very much myself. All I can recommend is, if you want to use or fight the san-ren-sei, you should find some books that cover it (or at least influence-based games, like cosmic Go) in depth, as well as books on sabaki. As it stands, I think you guys showed good diligence in trying to review the game, and if you guys keep working on learning this, you will probably be playing me evenly in no time at all.]

(;B[ic]C[Sergio thinks this is the best variation from F17 for white.

Jewdan: That's probably true. Black has some aji against White's upper-right group, but if White attacks Black's upper-left group with F18, then White's upper-left corner is unassailable. White has about forty points on the left side (with aji for plenty more), six in the lower right, and it seems fair to give another four for the upper-right.

Currently, Black has twenty-five sure points from the right side. Black has no points on the bottom because of the aji at H3 and the open skirt at N2. This means that, to win, Black needs to take at least thirty-two more points, and most of that will have to come from the moyo. This is probably possible, but since White has sente after this exchange, White can immediately play a move like M8 and watch Black's efforts wither.

That's the long way to say that the game is slightly in White's favor with an exchange like this.]
