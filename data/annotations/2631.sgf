C[Hello.
Before I played this game I set my rank to 12k. I don' play go often and I thought I got stronger a bit recently, so I just wanted to test my strenght.
I think I didn't play well, my opponent gained advantage and could even kill my center group. But even he made a mistake at the end, the game became equal, and he shouldn't give up so early.
I don't read moves forward well, but i think I have shape sense.
Plaese comment my game.
Sorry for my english.

:: Hello,
We discussed your game in a small group of our local go-club. I hope you'll find the following comments helpfull.

(;W[hq]C[
:: Maybe(!) this move is too loose on the black stone to the right.
See variation for some possible continuations.

> correct.  white wants to pincer black, and this is too wide. It leaves black with a one pint jump at k3.  A pincer should leave 1 or 2 empty spaces, not three.]

(;B[oq]C[> black should jump out rather than make this peep.]

(;W[nq]C[
:: We agreed that this was an important move. The variation is not as good, we concluded...

> I would connect against this peep, to get thick.];B[op]
(;W[oo]LB[pp:A]C[

:: This move invites trouble. The possibilities are immense. Maybe giving away the corner - while leaving potential with A - would be getter. See variation.

> this is the only move];B[pq]LB[oq:A]C[

:: It's not a good idea to let white build a wall facing black's sphere of influence towards the top. So the wide extension with A was not a good idea in the first place.

> correct];W[po];B[nr];W[mr];B[or];W[mq]C[Here I wasn't sure to connect at N3 becouse I was afraid of cut at O5.  I think after the cut one of my groups would die, but i couldn't find better move. Probaly O3 was too greedy.

:: As I already said. O3 was most likely a must. In this situation - after you invested all these stones - keeping the black stones from connecting to the outside with N3 is a must, too.
The cut at O5 could invite trouble - but trouble for both sides!

> conencting here is correct, but the cut at o5 is dangerous. This is why neede to connext at p4 after the peep.  See next move variations for some cut sequences.]

(;B[qp];W[qo];B[rp];W[ro];B[cm]C[

:: This move of black is too weak against the bottom or the top. One should decide what do to and not play halfhearted moves.

> yes.  This should be one space lower or higher.  You want to play where you can make a base with an extension.  Playing the middle is correct when it is wide enough that you can extend both ways.  That is not the case here, so you need to play where you can at least extend one direction.

Back needs one more move in the lower right corner, or has to cut and fight.]

(;W[cp]C[Maybe better at C9.

:: Yes, since the top group is weaker than the one at the bottom.
On the other side, after wC9 black could decide to take the corner. See variation.

Just as a sidenote:  We decided that the black group in the bottom right corner is dead. See second variation for some ideas.

> I like taking the big corner.  The group above is not so weak, and the move at C9 makes a strange shape.]

(;B[bj]
(;W[ck]TR[dj][cf]C[

:: This is not a good move since it forces black to connect beneath and actually weakens the connection of the white stones marked.

Furthermore I'd like to point your attention to the whole board situation (never forget about her!):
The most interesting constellation is on the ride side: A quite solid white wall facing into a quite loose black sphere of influence.

There is quite a solid sphere of influence for white at bottom.
The top left corner is quite surely black's.
Generally speaking the top right is wide open an neither's territory by now.

And there is almost no territory for either side on the left.
(Let's consider the bottom right corner alive.)


These circumstances help to decide where to play:

> But white can't ignore the last move and play elsewhere.  There are two adjacent weak groups so this area is urgent.

I agree that this is not a good move, but ince played, white has to continue and connect to the group below, making a wall.]
;B[bk];W[cl];B[bl]
(;W[nc]LB[ch:A]C[

:: You cannot tenuki from the situation to the left, I'd guess.

Now black has all the options. Playing black I'd start with A e.g..

So white should play there first. After that black will have to respond there too. Otherwise the black group will be struggling to live.

> correct.  White has to continue and connect along the outside. The moves just played need to make a wall to be effective.  Otherwise they are just some weak stones for black to chase later.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[jc];B[pf]
(;W[bn]C[


:: Again time to consider the whole-board situation:
The top right is black's. The ride side is still open and therefore big. The bottom (and left) is white's. The left side is unclear.
The top left is black (supposedly) the top edge is white (supposedly).

Due to two weak groups (of either player) the left side currently seems most interesting.
The white group there obviously needs reinforcement. Black's group there is very low.

So, your move at B6 is at the wrong side. -> Play from the weak group.

Actually B6 helps black. Since she can connect. This is very much a endgame-move!

>agreed.  If black had no way open upward, this would be good, to take away black's eyes.  But in this position, black can easily play above to escape and attack white, so this is a bad move. White should play on the outside to make a wall.]
;B[cn];W[bo];B[bm]TR[cn][cm]C[

:: Now black has sort of stepping stone into white's bottom 'territory'.

>correct.  White might have made a big center framework, but now there are only 3 weak stones.  This is a big loss for white.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[en]C[This move connects and builds moyo with cost of safety of upper left.


:: Yes. Now that all this mistakes happened you will have to stick with the top group, though.

> this move does not connect, but it does help build a moyo.]
;B[ch]C[

:: Now black separates the white stones.];W[dg];B[dh];W[eg]

(;B[em];W[fm];B[fl]C[


:: Black does good to create cutting points and therefore possibilities: taking the white stones on the left or reducing white's territory at the bottom.
Later the cut at O5 could get interessting again.

;W[ee]C[E15 Mistake];B[df];W[ef]LB[de:A]C[Now I think this is mistake too. I wanted to sacrafice to have external potential, but this move ensured black big advantage.


:: Yes, you should have played at A instead. This move would connect the corner to the outside. The corner ist too big to give away.

>yes.  and the white stones on the outside after your sacrifice are weak, not external potential.]
;B[de];W[ed];B[ec];W[gg];B[lo];W[no];B[gl];W[hj];B[hl]
(;W[mm]C[

:: This move is neither 'meat nor fish'.
It does not really attack the stones to the left and does not put pressure on the right side, either.

> yes.  I'd be worries about the cut coming at G14, so I would want to capture one stone at f12 to get thick there.

There is no attack on the stones on the left side.  Thet are strong.  The stone at H8 pushing through white's wall is 
wonderful for black.

Attacking the stones at the bottom must start with a cap at m7.]
;B[km];W[ln];B[kn];W[ko];B[jo];W[kp];B[jp];W[kq]C[

(;W[ql]LB[qk:A]C[

:: Maybe better one line above. I'd even consider the variation.

>Agree.  this move is too close to the white wall.  It takes almost no territory, and encourages black to surround the upper right.

> but playing one line higher is worse, since it makes black's upper right even more solid.

> would want to finish the lower side at J3 or invade the upper right at R12.]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[qk];W[pm];B[nj];W[mg]LB[me:A]C[Could I invade deeper to reduce black's territory?
I think black is strong here.


:: Currently black leads by about 20 points.
A deeper invasion is not really possible since the white group at the top is not that strong (Consider simply black A).

Actually the situation is much in favor for black.

> yes.  Forcing black to surround the upper right was very bad. In exchange white gained perhaps 5 points in front of his wall. Don't use walls to take territory.  Use them to support an attack or invasion.]

:: Pointless. And not a nice style to play. I would rather keep such kind of moves as ko-threats.

> correct.];B[dc];W[bc];B[bb];W[ke]C[> likewise pointless.  It doesn't help white and makes black stronger.  Later you might wish to peep from the other side. Keep this kind of move in reserve.  If black was weak, it would be a good peep, but black is very strong here.]

I think the game is close now. Maybe white has a few points more.
I think black didn't see he could catch n12 (or he is very good at counting).
