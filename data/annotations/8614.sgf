;B[cn]
(;W[fp];B[ci]C[I'm wondering if there's a difference between white playing low (keima) or jump.

Az: Yes, though it's subtle. I wouldn't loose sleep over it.]
;W[ei]C[Az: Dreadful move. This helps black secure territory easily.]
(;B[dk]C[Az: Wrong side! The corner is more important, and if white splits your extension you can invade C3 easily (that's why its so wide in the first place).]
;W[ch]C[I was reluctant to hane. What can you recommend? I'm a bit unsure about this kind of thing.

Az: The problem was a move earlier, this is kind of awkward now since its hard not to hurt the UL corner no matter how you play. Hane is out of the question though, WAY too low and submissive in your area.]
;B[di];W[dh];B[eh];W[ej];B[ek];W[bi]
(;B[bk]C[Az: Dreadful. This is very bad shape, makes it easy for white. You must block a hane like that, there is no danger to you from a cut.]
;W[bj];B[ck];W[de];B[ce]C[Az: This feels like an overplay.]
(;W[df]C[D14 is kinda weird. I was confused about how to continue.]
(;B[cf];W[dd];B[cd];W[ec];B[bg];W[fh];B[bh];W[db]
(;B[kc];W[od]C[Az: I don't like this for white, but you should response with pressure.]

C[I feel I was too soft in the fight ahead. Letting white settle easily but I dunno. It's difficult how to proceed.

Az: What should have been an easy situation where you have a stronger position is now messy, the root problem came from the hane.]
;B[hc];W[ng]
(;B[lf]C[Definitely mistake, right?

Az: Since the key cutting stones die, yes.];W[mf];B[le];W[me]
;B[kd]C[Az: Can you see why this is unplayable for black? White is very thick now, and your own group - though 'ok' for the moment - doesn't do anything. If you wanted to fight you MUST keep white apart.]
;W[lc];B[je];W[lg];B[eg]TR[cc]C[Az: If you played C17 as you should have earlier, then this would matter. As it is, this has no teeth. White can save the top easily, and he doesn't have about the remaining 3 stones floating.]
;W[dg];B[fg]C[Az: This is too blunt, you are asking to be pushed around but you can't push back against the top.]
;W[gg];B[gh];W[fi];B[gf];W[hg];B[ff];W[hf];B[gd];W[fd];B[he]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[cc]C[Az: What did you accomplish? White is stronger in the center (once he captures the cutting stone), his corner is bigger, and you got nothing.]
;B[ih];W[hh];B[gi];W[hi];B[gj]
(;W[jg];B[jf];W[hj];B[gk]
(;W[if];B[qm];W[qo];B[qj];W[pk]C[I considered resisting and maybe that would be better. Dunno.

Az: How are you going to resist? You should be grateful that you got a second lease on life by settling here, white has a lot of center thickness! Do you really want to fight next to a big wall like that?]
(;B[qk];W[pm];B[pl];W[ol];B[ql];W[om];B[kq]C[Az: The only move.]
;W[mq];B[hq];W[bp]
(;B[fr]C[At this point I think I should have reduced white center

Az: You should play here because white did not. W B4 directly is sloppy and should be punished.]

;B[dq];W[gm];B[hk];W[ik];B[oi]C[Az: Naturally. The game is starting to look up for black.]
