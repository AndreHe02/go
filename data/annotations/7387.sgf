;B[pd]C[Dear reviewer, thank you for spending your time going through my game. I have played black in this game, which was played on IGS. Although I will be grateful for any comments, I am especially interested in ideas how to handle white's r10 as I do not really know how to handle such attachments.

MR: Hello, please find my comments in the file marked with  "MR: ...".

In total, I do not think that you won or lost the game in the fight starting with the attachment at R10 (although I entered some comments on that fight as requested). The moves H17, H15, B17, C18 (and later B18) seem to be situations where you did not hit the urgent points. B17 is most inconsistent and in my opinion could easily have been the game loosing move. Finding the urgent moves in the middle game is in my opinion one of the most difficult tasks in go - so I cannot really tell you how to make sure to find them. However, maybe it helps to step back every now and then and to look where the weak groups are (yours and your opponent's ). Sometimes there are two-purpose-moves, e.g. moves that expand your territory and at the same time attack your opponents weak group, or there are moves that secure ones own group while stealing the base of your opponent (O9 and R18 could be examples). These moves tend to be urgent. Another type of urgent moves are those which, when your opponent plays them, secure his groups directly (H16 is an example).]

;W[fp]C[MR: Quite cautious. Even if white does not play here it is not so easy to attack the white group too hard.]

(;B[mq]C[MR: The direction is good. I am not too sure about the exact position, as this allows for the white extension L3 (good for white - although not urgent any more after F4) and the black extension K3 after a white invastion in the corner (good for black). An alternative would be to close the corner with Q3 instead of N3.]
;W[qq]C[MR: White accepts the invitation to enter the corner, which is a logical step.]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[oq];W[rp];B[ro]
(;W[or]C[MR: Wrong direction. White has to create weak points in blacks position on the right side.]

(;B[ci]C[MR: Black creates a very flat position on the left side. Although the last moves are joseki standalone, in connection with the joseki at the bottom black would normaly play D12 instead of C11.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qn];B[qo];W[qj]C[MR: For an attachment like R10, you normally have two possible answers - R9 or R11. Because of R6 in place, R11 makes it easier for white to make sensible shape. R9 in this case keeps R10 separated from R6.]

(;B[qk];W[qi]
(;B[pi]C[MR: Should be at S9 to keep the white stones separated.]

(;W[qg]C[MR: To me, Q12 looks too temptating for white.];B[pf]
;W[rf];B[rj]C[MR: It is difficult to decide what should be black's goal. Either black could encircle white (starting with S15, white will then make eyespace with Q12/Q13, S10, presumably) - black would have a wall to the center, but it is not really clear what to do with the wall in this game ... Or black can try to chase the white group, like you decided to do. But it appears to be rather difficult with Q12/Q13 and S15 open to really kill the group.]
;W[ri];B[sk];W[pg];B[re];W[og]C[MR: I personnally tend to be unwilling to allow my opponent to play moves like P13, poking his head into the big wide open.]

;B[nf];W[ng];B[mg];W[mh];B[lg];W[ni]C[MR: Now there are two "half settled" groups on the board - the black group in the upper right corner and the white group below.]
;B[hc]C[MR: To me this appears like "opening a new frontline" because of being unclear about what to do with the upper left groups ...]
;W[jc]C[MR: Now H17 can be treated as a forcing move.];B[he]
;W[gd]
(;B[bc]C[MR: Inconsistent. B17 is endgame when white can connect with H16. R18 would then be bigger endgame as it settles the black group on the top and allows to harder chase the white group on the right afterwards.]
;W[hd];B[cb]C[MR: Not urgent, not the topic of the game now.]
;W[db];B[cd];W[dc];B[jq]C[MR: R18 and O9 appear to be bigger to me, the upper edge is open anyway because of P2.]
;W[ok]C[MR: Good.];B[pk];W[nl];B[dm];W[ne];B[qb];W[ff]C[MR: Now H17, H15, N13, M13, O14 look like badly invested moves. White P9, O8 and F14 extend the white framework in a nice way.]
