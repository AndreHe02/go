RE[W+Resign]

C[Hi, I loosed with Black by resign after a big mistake. However, I think that I was about 10 points behind.
I think that every thing were lost after the 50st move and that I was behind all over the game. I'd like to understand why.
-----
P: Hi, my name is Peter. I play on KGS as Tartuffe and InExtremis (6-7k). Feel free to ask me any questions about the game or to ask for a game! My comments begin with P.]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[pq];W[qd];B[qo];W[oc];B[jq]C[At that point, I feel very happy with my black formation lower.
-----
P: Yes, you are doing fine.];W[fp]C[I think that R10 was biggest. Is it a white mistake ?
-----
P: You are correct, r10 is the biggest point on the board, followed by a move around c10. If I were white, I would probably approach from the other side, so as to work with the d16 stone. White cannot really expect to have an easy time developing inside black's strong position.]
;B[dn];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq]
(;B[ep]LB[cr:B][ep:A]C[P: c2 is joseki. black gets a settled position, white has a settled--but cramped--position, and black is free to expand his moyo with k5 (or to take another big point).]

(;W[cr]LB[cr:A][hq:B]C[P: White should probably cover the cutting point rather than introduce a new one!]
;B[dr];W[br]
(;B[bp]LB[bp:A][fq:B]C[P: The cut is pretty severe (see variation).]
;W[fq];B[cf]C[White stones are not completely settled. I could have attack them at G2. However, I choose to develop quickly on left side.
------
P: You were right to take sente here. However, I would have taken white's natural extension at r10. Thanks to black's thick position in the lower left, white's prospects are much better on the right side than on the left. As for plays on the left side, I think black was correct to take C14 (far away from black's thickness). A better player might argue that this move is just fine (I'm only 6-7k on KGS).]
;W[dh]C[I feel a bit disapointed by that pincer.
-----
P: The pincer complicates things, but you should be fine.];B[ef]
C[That move seems to me obvious, but it doesn't convince me.
-----
P: Seems fine to me.];W[fd];B[gf]C[I think that it's a mistake. I would instead have played C10 to attack the white stone.
-----
P: I think your move is fine. White really owes a move at H16, and then you should have time to play C10. Otherwise, you get H16, which is fine compensation.]
;W[dk]C[Now, black thickness is useless... :-(
------
P: Not yet... those two white stones do not have neither a base nor a thick group to which it can run.]

(;B[bd]LB[bd:A][hd:B]C[P: H16 is a great point to take here. It does many things:
1) attacks the two white stones on the upper side
2) prevents a large white territory from forming on the upper side
3) increases black's strength in the center
4) helps move the three black stones.
(see variation)]
(;W[cc]LB[cc:A][hd:B]C[P: Hmm... white should have played H16. (see variation)]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[hd]C[P: Good! This is huge for black. G14-H16 influence the whole board.]
;W[jc];B[hc];W[bc]C[P: White is forced to defend... painful!]
;B[fb]C[I think that R10 was biggest.];W[be];B[bf];W[ad];B[je]
C[P: Questionable... K5 seems bigger. Alternatively, R10 reduces white's potential for a moyo.]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[oj]
(;B[mc]LB[mc:A][ol:B]C[P8 instead ?
-----
P: I like this invasion. Lots of profit and reduction. White gets to invade you as well, of course.]
;W[md];B[le]C[P: Interesting move... I'm not sure about the best play around here.]

(;W[me]LB[ld:B][me:A];B[ld];W[nc];B[mb];W[mq]C[I don't really know how to deal with such an invasion.
-----
P: One idea is to begin by reducing white's right side moyo in sente (beginning with N14).]

(;B[jo]LB[jo:A][mf:B]C[What about a more agressive move like M4 ?
------
P: I like L5 here... If you are trying to kill, the main idea is to keep white to one eye on the edge. However, killing white seems unlikely.]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[or];B[pr];W[nq]
(;B[gn]C[I think that it's another mistake. N5 ???
-----
Yes, this move is a mistake. It does not attack any weak groups, nor does it defend any of your own weak groups (though it does play near the k3 stones, which are somewhat weak). N5 seems a little loose. How about N14? F11?]
;W[dg];B[df];W[bh];B[mo];W[no];B[nn];W[oo];B[on];W[kq]
(;B[mk]C[I hesitated a lot between L4, and N9. N9 aim is to invade white moyo.
-----
Attacking the white stones a little bit more is probably the right idea (check out the many variations).]
;W[jp];B[ip];W[kp];B[hp];W[mg]C[P: Ouch... white finally covered his weakness. The game is still close, though, and black should be able to find a way to win.]
;B[mi]C[P: If you are feeling behind, go in a little deeper. Just be careful not to die and not to give white too much thickness!]
;W[mp];B[ln];W[ni]
(;B[bl]C[I think that it's another mistake. Perhaps building a black moyo with G9 ?
-----
I like that idea, yes. Also, it might be time to take some of the double sente points. (s9, q1)]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[gl]C[P: Black is definitely falling behind now.]

(;B[gs]C[P: This doesn't feel like the biggest endgame move available. Q19 is a far more destructive (and sente!) monkey jump, s9 is clearly double sente, pushing around n12 reduces in sente, q1... does it kill? Anyway, g1 is a low priority right now. Also, it is awkward shape. I'd rather see a move around H2 to prepare for N1.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[fs];B[gq]
(;W[fr]TR[bj][db][mh][os][pa][rk]C[At that point, I think that I have no good move and that I'm well behind.
-----
P: Try to assess how far behind you are. If you are only a little behind, try to catch up with solid endgame play. If you are very behind, you need to be risky. In my opinion, it is close enough not to play dangerously. However, you cannot afford to play passive moves. I marked some of the big endgame moves with triangles.]
;B[fi]C[F12 was more secure.

P: Hmm... you have a forcing move as well.];W[fh];B[gh];W[fg]

(;B[ol]TR[bj][ca][mf][ps]C[P: A small mistake, but at this point of the game, it's an important one. To win you need to take all of these points. You could probably get some (certainly N14, C19, maybe Q1 and B10) in sente.]
;W[pl];B[pk];W[pm];B[om];W[qm];B[fo];W[bk]C[P: Black should have gotten here first. This game is pretty much over unless black gets lucky.]
