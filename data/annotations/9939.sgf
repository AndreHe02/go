C[Hello, my comments are marked with 'A'.

The key ideas from this game are:
1. Attacking is getting profit, so attacking is winning. When you are under attack, try to ignore and sacrifice.
2. When you are a lot stronger in center, develop first a big moyo and attack everything around. Don't play big territorial moves unless they are taking away someone's base.
3. When attacking, set priorities: enclose in sente first (if the life is small and there are another targets for attack), next - take away the base, third - follow the weak group towards the center and create new targets, for which the new stones are useful. Those targets can be not only groups, but your partner's areas to invade/reduce too.]

C[White is a trick play, not joseki.
Black continues with 'a'.
Black 'b' is a mistake.

(LL)

A: Yes - you should capture without any ko here.]
(;W[hq];B[sn];W[dq]C[A: Here you are attacked, and you have two options: (answer and get a weak group) OR (attack too and make bigger damage). The second seems to me much better, and here it's possible.]

(;B[ep];W[do];B[fn];W[gp];B[fo];W[dm];B[hn];W[kp]LB[bo:2][eq:1]
[lq:3]C[A: This is a big loss. Black steals 15 points with 1, but gets a (still) weak group, and White comfortably takes about 35 points (2 and 3 areas).]
;B[fc];W[cf]
(;B[db];W[nc]C[A: White takes the initiative, good.]
(;B[qf]C[A: Given the Black's stones in the centre, I think you should fight here. It's not so easy, but letting White's stone live easily on the side of your interest is strange.]
;W[cc];B[ic]
(;W[qc]C[A: White's mistake - should just live on the side.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re]LB[qe:B][rf:A]
(;B[rf];W[qe];B[pe];W[qd];B[og]C[A: In this variation, White's corner is bigger, and he has more space at the right side.]
;W[ok];B[gk]LB[ff:1][lo:2]C[A: I think 1 is much more important. You have 2 in sente and center influence, so White can't attack your group much.]

(LL)

A: The move A is normal, but consider that you'll get less than if enclose at the previous move (marked with squares). That's why move 1 is questionable.]

(LL)

A: White tries to save too much, but he can't connect. Let's take out his base: if one group runs out, the second becomes enclosed in sente and then killed.]
