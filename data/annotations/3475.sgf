C[pajaro: Hi. I'm going to try to point out the biggest mistakes and offer some variations. Enjoy!]
;B[dd];W[qp];B[dq];W[pc];B[pe];W[pj]MA[pi][qi][qh][ph][pg][qg]
C[pajaro: This is not a pincer. It's too far away, because black can make a 2-space extension and feel comfortable. The right possible pincers are marked.]
;B[op];W[jp]C[pajaro: Same.];B[qq]C[krv: Can I tenuki on this move?

pajaro: Hard to say. As it's still early on the game, you could take a big point. If black plays another move to take the corner, you gte sente again. So if you have a good plan, you might play tenuki.]
;W[rq];B[pq];W[pn];B[lq]C[pajaro: Because K4 was so far, black gets a comfortable position.]
;W[do];B[co];W[cn];B[cp];W[dn];B[fq];W[dj];B[qc];W[cf]C[pajaro: In this case, white plays tenuki. C14 is ok.]
;B[fc];W[ef];B[ch]
(;W[eh]C[pajaro: I think I'd play D12 here. Black has a lot of room to maneuver.]
;B[cj];W[ck];B[dg];W[df];B[di];W[ei];B[dk];W[ej];B[bk];W[cl]
;B[bl];W[bm];B[bi];W[dh]C[pajaro: This looks like a mistake. B13 first to reduce eye space and aiming to B12, making an eye false.]
;B[bg];W[ci];B[bj];W[bf];B[ag];W[af];B[bd]C[pajaro: No. C13 is needed to guarantee life.]
;W[cg]C[pajaro: Mistake again. Black needs to fight a ko.]
(;B[bh];W[al];B[ak];W[ai];B[am];W[an];B[dl];W[cm];B[fl]C[pajaro: This is unreasonable. Black can't expect to kill D6. So, D8-D9 are unimportant stones that now become heavy. White must take the chance and attack.]
;W[fn];B[hl];W[hn];B[hp];W[jm];B[jl];W[ip];B[im];W[in];B[gj]
;W[hm]C[pajaro: This is the kind of atari that you must avoid. White is connected, so there is no need for this. Also, you make black stronger because perhaps later he will have some weakness.]
;B[il];W[qg]C[pajaro: Doubtful. You extend from the strong side, forcing black to kill your Q17. Better defend that stone.]
;B[pd];W[jd];B[lc];W[nc]C[pajaro: First big mistake of white, I think. White forced Q16, then he did not help Q17. And now that black has become stronger there, you try to save Q17!! It will just be a burden and a target for black.]
;B[me];W[ld];B[md];W[mc];B[kd]

C[How far should I push black here?

pajaro: How far? Hmm... The question is, should you push black here? Black is going to get a lot of territory at the top. In exchange, you get thickness. You need a _very_  good plan to put this thickness to work, such as killing J8 and get a big center. But when your plans need a big kill, there must be something basically wrong. So perhaps, push once to avoid b K13 and stop.]
;B[jf];W[jg];B[if];W[ig];B[hf];W[hg]C[krv: N11 now to protect two cutting points?

pajaro: M13-O13, you mean? N12 is fine.];B[km];W[jn];B[kj];W[mo]

;B[nj];W[mi];B[mj];W[cq]C[Should I leave this move for endgame?

pajaro: Sure. The main focus is in the center. You also lose ko threats now.]
;B[bq];W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[fr];W[gr];B[bs];W[ol];B[nl];W[gl]
C[pajaro: Even if you cut some stones here, it induces b G9, which helps black. You must think in eye shape now.]
;B[pi];W[oi]C[krv: How to play here? (next few moves are difficult to me)

pajaro: Contact plays are used for defense. You are ahead, so play safe. R11.]
;B[oj];W[pk];B[oh]
(;W[ni]C[krv: O12 now?

pajaro: O12 much better.];B[ng]
(;W[pg]C[pajaro: Q13 is not important anymore, because black can capture M14. R11 better to defend the right side.]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[mh];W[ph];B[li];W[qi];B[fe]C[pajaro: Too soft. b G13 is quite annoying.]
;W[kh]C[pajaro: This saves an unimportant stone. Black has more ways to live.]
;B[om];W[pm];B[ok];W[gk]C[pajaro: This is a small capture.]

;B[ki]C[pajaro: b K12 captures.];W[ik];B[jj];W[ff]C[pajaro: This gives nothing. More ko threats lost.]
;B[gf];W[nh];B[mg]C[krv: missread. It's seems to me that j13 group is already dead. But this group is still alive.
That's why I've just played all sente moves which considers that group.

pajaro: Yes. There for a long time.];W[jk];B[jh];W[kl];B[lm]
;W[np]C[krv: How should you deal with P4 group?

pajaro: I think black can capture O4 by playing O5. It's a safe group. Just reduce it, starting with S2.]

;B[ac];W[bc]C[krv: Can I make life here? Or I mus leave upper left corner for many ko treats?
Seems like I'm behind near to 10 points. How to play to keep chances?]

;B[gd];W[gb];B[gc];W[ol]C[pajaro: Again this ko. Not that big, I think.]
;B[mk];W[jl];B[pl];W[ed]C[pajaro: This loses points. E15 instead. Same threat, less loses.]
;B[ee];W[ol];B[qf];W[ea]C[pajaro: Not a threat. White is dead.]
;B[da];W[qe];B[pl]C[pajaro: Well, that's all. The main mistake I saw is a lack of global view. You must consider the effects of your moves in the rest of the board, and whether an area is big enough, or better switch elswhere.]
