(;W[ne]C[Chris: This early in the game I would take the empty corner first. Either way I dont like the way the game turned out. Black gets too solid and White has the burden of making sure that the structure he got in the centre turns out to be well positioned. From now on the gams will be good for you.

According to Kogos:
"White '6' was considered joseki a long time, but is now considered an inferior variation..."]
;B[me];W[mf];B[md];W[pc]
(;B[qc]C[This is the end of the joseki as I know it. What is the right answer for black to this move?

Chris: This move is submissive.];W[lf]C[Chris: This move is correct.]
;B[id];W[qf]LB[pf:A][pg:B]C[Chris: Too agressive. It wont kill Black, so better attack in a way that makes White thick. Maybe A or B.]
;B[pe];W[of]C[Chris: Whites shape is thin.];B[pf];W[pg]C[This figth does not look good for black, but what should I had done?]
;B[qg];W[qh];B[oe];W[rg];B[nd];W[nf];B[pl]LB[qn:A]C[Is Q8 the right place?

Chris: This is not very well positioned. The idea to restrict Whites thickness is correct. But Q8 does not protect the corner very well. A splitting invasion is possible, and likely, considering the thickness White has built.
The weapon of choice here should have been an Oogeima shimari at A. It protects the corner well, restricts Whites thickness. It is so solid that White will not be able to use the thickenss to attack (which he should do). A shimari would make the bottom side very big.]
;W[dq];B[qo]C[Chris: Too slow. Kakari!];W[jq];B[do]C[Is this approach the best in this situation?
Chris: It is the only approach.];W[eo]
(;B[dp]C[Chris: This variation leads to unnecessary complications. Since K3 is too close and low there is no need for drastic measures.]

(;B[na]C[Was this needed? Would not tenuki be better?

Chris: Too small, again. Black is still connected.];W[mo]
(;B[hm]LB[hm:67]C[Is this the biggest?

Chris: B67 does not protect the moyo. White punishes well and easy, since the gap is so inviting!]
;W[el]
(;B[hk]LB[hp:A]C[Chris: This move is completely meaningless. A is the only move to compensate for the H7 softness.]
;W[cl];B[dm];W[em];B[ej];W[dl];B[kh]C[Was this tenuki worse for that 4 points?
Chris: This move is much better! It shows the attitude of a stronger player. Well done.]
