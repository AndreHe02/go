C[Hi reviewer.

I have made lots of annotations on the game.
Here are a few places where I would most like to see your comments

How to play against 5-5 stone in the opening?
Move 48 -- what part of board to play in?
Move 54? what's the best direction of attack?
Move 80 -- Good to connect here, or is it too slow?

And of course any important points that I missed.

It's maybe not so  important for you to comment on all of the long variations that I included, although of course I would welcome your comments there as well.

Thanks for your time,
Norman (Norman314 on KGS)

Jay: I will be glad to review this game. One big question is how one respond to the 5-5 like high moves, or any other unconventional high moves, such as tengen move, designed to influence fighting at the center. In this game, it is apparent that you were not use to such fighting game, and played loosely to avoid risks in mid-game that made you trailing behind. My advice is to take necessary risky, realizing that your oppnenet is taking equal risks by playing openning like this. Since you are playing upper hand, getting into complicated fighting is not necessarily bad thing for w.]

I very rarely see this opening. Not sure how to play against it.

Jay: high moves emphasize on center fighting. Such moves usually invite center invasion into his/her moyo. The obvious drawback is giving away territory early on.]

;B[on];W[pm];B[om];W[qe]C[Position on right side seems pretty stable, so time to approach the other corner. This approach seemed good because it can coordinate with the stones on the right side.

Jay: As developed in the game W is quit painful, having all the stones on the right side not doing much, while B gaining a moyo at the bottom. This moyo later became the central focus of the game.]

Jay: This result is ok for w.];B[fn]
(;W[mc]C[Not sure if this move was so great. It stabilizes the K16 stone , so that if black invades the area on the top left, I will be strong on both sides. It also starts to put pressure on black's top right group. But maybe there are bigger or more urgent moves. What do you think of the alternatives I suggest here?

Jay: This is a correct direction, although I would argue that N17 is a bit conservative. O17 is a better extension.]

(;W[ee]C[Jay: This is a bit passive.];B[hc]
(;W[jb]C[Not sure whether this is the right direction to attack from. It seemed best because it denies black a base, so I can continue to attack him for longer, and I also get a bit of territory along the top.. But black willseparate my wall from the other stones on the top, so I may eventually have to reinforce the wall.

Jay: Given the circumstance, this is the correct direction of attack. This provide W's own base to stablize the top group. But, it is a bit too loose, like D18+ E15 moves earlier, leaving too much space for B to settle.]
;B[he]
(;W[jf]C[Jay: This is too loose: It is not a forceful attacking move, while it is facing wrong direction to build a wall for moyo. .]
;B[hg]
(;W[dk]C[Jay: This stone is not doing much, thus is not urgent at this point. As you found out later, the long jump at A9 can not be fixed with this move. C9 would be better for that purpose. This stone is also not doing much for center fighting. This is a 0.5 komi game, thus W need to take initiative to fight. 

It appears that K14 stone is the problem leaving W very hard to decide what to do next. The bottom moyo is an urgent problem for w. This move does little to solve for this problem. Any direct invasion would not be desirable.]

(;B[kq];W[dr]C[the corner is big, and I'm not sure how to continue the attack on the top.

Jay: The exchange L3 and D2 are game stablizing moves. But, right now W is behind in territory, so slow moves like these is in B's favor.]
;B[re];W[rf];B[sd]C[black takes gote, makes me happy.]
(;W[ji]C[I try to continue the attack, but not sure whether I get much out of it.

Jay: This stone, like k14 stone, is not doing much in either attacking or building moyo. Another loose move. You need to avoid such loose moves, especially when opponent had invaded your moyo and destroyed it. As an upper hand you need to complicate the game not simplify it.]

Jay: This is a solid move, almost a must. The earlier slow moves are the problem, not this one.]
;B[er];W[gl]C[I liked this move -- grows my territory while reducing black a bit. But it is maybe too overconcentrated. If black makes a wall along the sixth or seventh line, he gets too much, I think -- about 60 points on the bottom, which is more than I have on the whole board.

Jay: Normally W has to answer E2 move. There are only 40 solid pts at the bottom. But, B is hehind at this point of the game.]
;B[hm]
(;W[jm]C[So I played here to try to reduce black's bottom, but I'm not sure whether it's a good move. It lets black in at H8.

Jay: G8 and H7 are normal result. But K7 is inconsistent with G8.]

;W[ln];B[mp];W[mo];B[np]C[Well, that reduction maneuver went pretty well, and all in sente. I still have the cut at H9 to make a bit of territory in the center. My strong group in the top and center should help me if black tries to cut off my reducing group.]

C[ouch! I didn't realize how big this monkey jump was. My position is very high, so I have no good way of sealing it in, and if I cut it off, black might be able to live or connect out. Makes me think I should have played at B12 earlier. Since I can't do much against it, and A8 won't harm me much further, I tenuki.]
