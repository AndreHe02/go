Hi my name is Jay and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments start with "J:".]
;B[pd]C[sensei418 [-\]: you too];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn]
;B[jp];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[fc];W[cg];B[id]C[J: K16 may be better, because if you jump in the corner, J16 will be too close to the resulting white thickness.]
;W[pp]C[jawnaw2000 [8k\]: Up until here, I think my opening is fine. I should've done P3 instead.

J: actually either direction seems fine.]
(;B[qp];W[qo];B[rp]C[J: My problem with S4 is that white may play p3 and keep black small in the corner.  So p4 first.]
(;W[ro];B[op];W[po];B[oq];W[oo];B[of]C[J: Big, and very timely]
;W[oi];B[ff];W[jc];B[ic]C[J: Actually, white should not pull out here. maybe 14 to make black heavy.]
(;W[kd]C[jawnaw2000 [8k\]: Here, I think I should've poked and made his shape heavy and then lead from the right side.]
(;B[me]C[J: This shape is too heavy.  See variation.];W[kf]

C[J: After this exchange, i don't see black's compensation for losing the moyo.]

;W[mo];B[ko];W[kn]C[J: now the game is hard for black.]

sensei418 [-\]: ty

jawnaw2000 [8k\]: before I kew it you were building that nice right side

J: hmm, too early to resign.  See continuation.];B[bd]C[J: hard for c17 group to live. My last comment, thanks for showing me this game.

The take away from this game is that a deep invasion into a moyo should have equal compensation.  The top whte group lived and you didn't get anything out of it.  You could have used the attack on the group to reduce the right white moyo.]
