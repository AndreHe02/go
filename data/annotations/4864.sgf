C[Thank you for reviewing this game. I played black, and I would like to ask especially for comments on early stages: opening and early mid game. Could you show me big moves I missed? A general comment what I should work on to improve is also kindly welcome. Some detailed question are also inserted into the file. Once again, thank you!
Piotr];B[pq];W[dd];B[qd];W[dp]LB[oc:A][pk:B]C[I don't know exactly what's best here, but I would consider making an enclosure in the top corner (A) or perhaps treating the opening as more of a Chinese fuseki (B).]

(;B[pj]C[This stone looks a little too far away from the bottom  stone here for my tastes.]
;W[pn]
(;B[qo]LB[np:A]C[Piotr: Is this a proper way to handle the Whites's invasion?

Answer:  Generally, you don't want to touch a weak stone.  In this case, I would consider A as another possibility.]
;W[po]
(;B[pp]C[This seems okay.  I might also consider R6 (see variation)]
;W[qn];B[ro];W[rj]C[This looks like it's too far for white to go.  I think this connection can be broken with a play at r8, creating two white groups that can be attacked, though one would need to be careful not to make the Q10 stone too weak.]

(;B[fq];W[hq]C[I always prefer to run at least once before I jump into the corner (see variation).]

(;B[cq];W[dq]
(;B[cp]C[Piotr: were Black 17 at d2 better?

Answer:  Yes, I think you want to play d2 first (see variation)]
;W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]

(;W[ep]C[Piotr: I think this W's move wasn't the best one?

White should just make the solid connection at e2.  This leaves a little weakness at e2 with no compensating advantage.  At the very least, this should cost white a few extra points in the end game (see four variations)]

(;B[fp]C[If you're going to try something with this stone, go down first and threaten to connect, then white can't undercut you.]
;W[fr];B[fn];W[gm];B[jc];W[nc];B[fc];W[db]
(;B[oc]LB[oe:A]C[I would again not touch this stone.  A seems better.]
;W[nd];B[od];W[kd];B[jd];W[ke]C[By touching him, you've helped him escape...don't attack by touching.  Attack by fencing things in loosely to put pressure on them.]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[kb];W[jb];B[ib];W[lb];B[ja];W[mb]LB[ne:F][cf:A]
[pg:G][ql:H][lp:D][mp:E][lq:C][mq:B]C[It's hard to tell, but at this point you want to try to find the biggest space on the board to play in.  It looks to me that if white gets a play around m3-4 it could be very big because of his thickness on the left.  It's hard for me to tell exactly what might be the biggest at this point.

The lettered spots are all places I might consider.]
(;B[cf]C[Piotr: I think I should play somewhere more in the middle between the both W's groups? c12 or c11?]

[fo][go][ho][io][jo][ko][jp][iq]C[Black should be very happy with this....none of white's thicknesses are helping each other.   They're pointing in different directions, so black should have the advantage.]
;W[df];B[lq]C[Good...so you played the top left to your advantage and then took sente to find another big point.]
;W[qg];B[rf];W[rg];B[qf];W[pg];B[ln]
(;W[go]C[This move by white only ends up helping black.  Even H5 is better.]
;B[fo];W[gn];B[eq]C[Here white's earlier weakness comes back to hit him hard.]
;W[do];B[gr];W[hr];B[gq]C[With this black has secured a strong lead.  He has solid territory in all four corners and along some of the sides.  White still has no solid territory.  All of white's territories are open and can be further reduced.]
;W[hp];B[fm];W[fl];B[gl];W[fk];B[gk];W[il]
(;B[fj]LB[gj:A]C[I think white just has to cut here.  See A]

(;B[kj]C[Piotr: too defensive?

Maybe a little.  I would probably play M8.  Then they're connected with nothing to worry about.]
;W[ok]
(;B[pk]C[This stone is really hard to save now, but you use them well to push white back....I would maybe not spend this stone, though....go directly for s7.]
;W[pl];B[rm];W[rn];B[sn];W[rl];B[qm];W[sl];B[sm];W[ql];B[so]
C[This is unnecessary.  Take your sente and go somewhere else.  Wait until he forces you to do this before you spend the move on it.  It's your free move anywhere you like.]
;W[no];B[np];W[km];B[jm]
(;W[kl]C[This doesn't work for white....better to try for a connection at K8]
;B[jl];W[hm];B[kn];W[ml];B[jo];W[in]

(;B[kq]LB[jp:B][kq:A]C[Piotr: I'm not quite sure but I guess my move should be at k4 to kill the big W group (please have a look at the variation)?

I think you're right.  I can't find a way for white to save the group after K4.]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[ir];B[kr];W[hs];B[gs];W[kk]LB[ae:A][sg:C][aj:B]
[pm:D]C[This is a bad move for white....take a look at variation D.]

(;B[ll]LB[ae:A][sg:D][aj:B][pm:C]C[Piotr: Is there something bigger at this moment than killing the three stones (6 points gote)?

Well, almost anything that's sente (unless it's really small) shoudl be worth more.  I'll show a few in variations.

So any of those are more....really, white should ignore this move and play C himself.]

;W[ck];B[ak];W[am];B[bp];W[ai];B[an];W[em];B[oe]C[Piotr: What else could I do to reduce W's moyo? Could I still use somehow q9 stones?

Q9 stones are done.  There's not much you can do at this point....t13, a15....the problem at a9 made the game very close.]
