C[Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I've put my name before all my remarks.

I think the biggest thing you need to look at is cutting points: where you can separate your opponent's stones, and where he can separate yours.  You got lucky when your opponent missed some double ataris]

;B[mc];W[li];B[oc]C[Ted: I think this move is a bit slow.  Both of your groups are stable for the time being, and you can make more territory elsewhere while White tries to figure out what to do with the stone at O16.]

I understand the point is to try to surround the M4 stone, but this doesn't work so well with the group to the left.  All those stones are on the fourth line and above, and you need something on the third line to try to get some territory.]

;B[eg]C[how can I reduce white territory in the north corner ?  Must I play here or in C12  to get the left side ?

Ted: Contact moves are generally defensive, so I don't think I'd play C12.  However, I would worry about White extending from C13.  So I would proabaly play B11 first, and then either E13 or A14, depending on what White lets you play.]
;W[df];B[ef];W[ee];B[cc]C[it is possible to have a living group here ?

Ted: I don't think so.

But it's more important to ask whether you *need* to make a living group to win.  You're slightly ahead as it is, and you have better moves available to reduce your opponent's territory.  And most importantly, you have sente.  You can play B11 now, and still have the monkey jump at A3, or another reducing move at D2.]

(;B[ch]C[2 ko in D12 and Q9, and i have the initiative, but is it really important that i get it because white haven't points in this points and must protect this points. thanks to give me an explanation for knowing how to respond to it in the future.

Ted: Count the territory.  If you count carefully, you'll note that you're just about even, depending on what happens in two areas: around A11, and around D5.  Play A11 instead, since it's bigger.

The point is that you don't need to worry about the one-point kos right now.  Look for the bigger moves.]
