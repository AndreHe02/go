C[Hi, my name is Johanna Tuominen. i'm EGF 2kyu from Finland (KGS 1 kyu). I added some comments and variations, hope they help. Enjoy the game of Go.

I'm pubster, this is my new account, lucas001(6k). In this (25min)game, i'm suppose to lose but got lucky. I managed to catch him unaware and kill a major group. My recent games were also all like that. I always seems to fall behind in fuseki but later the games evolved into big fights and the results always depends on whether i succeed in killing groups.

I felt i won most of my recent games because my opponents played wrongly and allowed me to kill it. I'm very unsatised about that because that means I won due to luck and my fuseki is bad.

I wanted to know what actually happen to my play as I remember last time I used to play decent fuseki. I think i made many mistakes in the game. Please correct me and tell me what i should look out for and improve on at the end of the game.

Many thanks and enjoy my badly play game.];B[pd]
(;W[pq]C[JT: I would prefer R4 instead of Q3, because if black approach in Q5 is excellent move from black side.]
;B[cd]
(;W[ed]C[I played here because i'm bad at invasion and reduction if b decide to play chinese later.

JT: I added some common variations from pro games against low-chinese opening from move 1.  A goofd way to learn variations agains some fuseki is to play it by yourself. That is, play low-chinese when you are black and review later how your opponen deals with it ...

In general your move is not bad...];B[gc];W[cc];B[de];W[dc]
C[Attaching at c17 and extending at d17 for a base, while he had 2 groups. Also not afraid of cut at d17 as i will counter cut at d16]
;B[jd];W[gd];B[hd];W[ge];B[dg];W[ci]C[thinking of keeping pressure on black d15 group, sweeping under at b13 to deny base. but if he play b13, i just go c8.]

(;B[dq]TR[cf]C[JT: Blacks tenuki is a mistake. If white play to the marked spot. See variations.]

;W[fl];B[ih];W[qf]C[black look big on top so i thinking of coming here. I was afraid of him getting double wing and become to big as i said earlier on that i'm bad at invasion and reduction. Is there a better place?

JT: This is nice move.];B[qe];W[pf];B[md];W[qj];B[po];W[qm]
;B[np];W[nq];B[mq];W[op]C[i don't know the correct play here.]
;B[mp];W[oo];B[jp];W[hp]LB[hq:A]C[black looks big at bottom as well now, white seems to be behind in points. So i try to reduce. Is this correct?

JT: Usually the lower reduction in A is better because this is easy to block (black didn't play correctly in this game).
 However in this case black is too strong and it would most likelty to end into hard fight, but keep that in mind.  So in this case the H4 is better, safer move.]

(;B[iq]C[JT: Böack should have been played in H3. See variation from previous move.]
;W[hq];B[io];W[go];B[oj]C[when this is played, i nearly gave up. Not only this is a great capping play, the center now also seems to belong to him.

JT: Black is trying to form center area. At this phase, white is slightly behind but not much.]
;W[pn];B[pk];W[qk];B[pl]LB[hm:A][nm:B]C[JT: By preventing the formation of black center area nice moves might be for instance in a or b. Also the upper right corner is open. See the variations.]

(;W[ne]C[thinking of limiting is top while maybe trap the 3 black stones at p10

JT: This is a bit loose play. The p10 stones have atleast two directions to escape so catching those stones will be difficult.]
;B[nd];W[oe];B[od];W[kg]C[JT: Why not O7 or H7 now.  I black tries to seal your upper left group you can live there by playing F17,and then B16 easily.]
;B[pm];W[qn];B[jg];W[jf];B[kh]C[here i think white have no chance to trap black already.]
;W[lf];B[nn]
(;W[no];B[mo]C[here i wanted to resign. but i thought, why not play a few more hands in the center, cutting black stones, maybe i can get something. but i know that chance is so slim that striking lottery might be easier.]

;W[kj];B[ni];W[gl];B[hl];W[hk];B[gj];W[ik]C[so i have cut. I have my eyes on J12 group  and maybe N11 group. but i know the chances is minimal as if black just play solidly, the cutting stones can be capture too easily.]

(;B[km]C[JT: Blöacks mistake.];W[jm];B[kn];W[hn]C[I got lucky, i can't believe my luck.. With these 2 black stones and my white stones in the center safe, i might be still in the game.]
;B[ho];W[gn];B[in];W[im];B[gp];W[hi]C[thinking maybe i can kill this major black group as well, or at least the 4 stones at j12.]

;B[nh]TR[rf][bn][nr]C[JT: Examples where white should play now. If black plays the atari from N13, white can handle it. See variation.]

(;W[mg]C[this is a terrible L shape. can i played o13 instead? but i'm afraid for white group and decide to play safe instead.

JT: Well the game is over for black already but if you want to seek big points, this isn't one of them.]

;B[lj];W[gm]C[Here black resigned. Black should have the game earlier but i think he got careless. I think i have play a lot of terrible moves and only win because of luck. Please help to review my game and tell me what i can improve on. And is it because of my poor fuseki which results in my recents games being all big fights?

A lot of thanks for the effort and time taken to review my game. *bow*]
