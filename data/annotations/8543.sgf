HAL9000 [18k\]: hi

Hi!

Thank you for reviewing my game!

I am Burak "malkuth" and I was black in this game. I won the game but this is my first win after a long time and it's mostly because of my opponents carelesness so It doesn't count that much in means of my improvement.

I made some obivious mistakes as my opponent also did. besides that I want to  know my mistakes in the beginning, joseki and fuseki and my mistakes in the fight. I don't know how to and where to direct my opponent.

Sincerely

;B[eq];W[br]LB[ce:A][oq:B]C[I prefer A and B over D1.];B[ds]
C[I lost the initiation

This move is quite slow. Protecting this one stone is not that important. Better to play an encloe on the right, such as P3.]
;W[op]LB[kp:E][lp:C][mp:A][kq:D][mq:B]C[I would definitely play a pincer here. A pincer would put pressure on the white stone and serve as an extnsion from the bottom. ANy of the marked moves would be fine.]
;B[oq];W[po]C[This move is bad. You should be able to take advantage.]
(;B[pp]C[This ok, but I prefer the variation.];W[qo]
(;B[ro]C[This is a big mistake. The atari at o4 is very important.]
;W[nq]C[how am I getting trapped in a small area as I began on san san? this doesn't seem right]
;B[oo];W[np];B[pn]C[did I punish him the right way or will it be better for him to ignore these stones and begin a wall by playing O5?

This is fine. White loses a lot here. It's always bad to play out a working ladder. White gave away too much here. 05 is much better for white than playing the ladder.]
;W[qn]C[that is his first big mistake, giving me territory and wall]

(;B[or]C[this happens all the time and I don't know what to do, I just do the same and force him to kill my stones to  play  defensive but  he gets the wall and territory.

This move is bad. It allows white to take more of the corner. Variations shown.]

;B[qf];W[on];B[sm];W[no];B[po];W[om]
(;B[ol]C[This move is odd. White is building a big wall and you really need an extension on the bottom.]
;W[nl];B[de]C[It's very unusual to ignore white's O8. White can play atari and get several forcing moves reducing your territory]
;W[cd]C[is that a right move? can I use it for myself?:) what should be my move and my gain?

White's move here is fine. Your response, however, cost you a lot territoy and influence.]
(;B[dg]C[This is bad. It takes no territory and it leaves your group floating on the 4th line with white underneath.]
;W[dj];B[ce]C[Disaster. White got the extension on the left and your stones are overconcentrated. You are cramped for space here, but white is comfortable.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[fd]
(;B[fe]C[I hate touching

Then don't do it. The variation might be better.];W[id];B[mc]
C[I love this shape

Well. Your upper right coner is not quite secure. WHite has some moves up there.

But this is indeed a nice move. It extends your corner and takes some of the top from white.]
;W[kc];B[fg]LB[ok:A][jq:B]C[I have personal safety issues I guess :p

This is a bit paranoid. White would have a hard time killing this group. It has lots of eyeshape and room to run. Better to play A or B,]
(;W[oj]C[This isn't white's best move locally. I prefer the varation.]
;B[pj];W[ok];B[pl];W[pk];B[qk];W[pi];B[qj];W[pm]C[mostly he is directing me in the battle and usually he has the sente

That's because you're giving it to him. As a general rule, you should never fill R8 just to save these stones. It's very very slow. If white takes, you can just take right back, so it's not a huge gain. Very small in fact. Double digit kyus make this mistake pretty frequently, but you'll never see a dan player fill here. Go play something bigger, somewhere else.]
(;B[ql];W[og]C[White has built a very big wall. It's becoming increasingly urgent that you do something about it]
;B[nf]C[he can seperate me now but the territory and reaching the left side seemed better

I don't understand this move at all. It doesn't gain you much and it only helps white.]
;W[qg];B[of];W[rf]

(;W[rg]C[You were spared by white's mistake here.];B[pe];W[se]
;B[rd];W[sd];B[sc];W[sf]
(;B[qc]C[this could be tenuki maybe

Not if you want to keep your corner. Variation shown.];W[mh]
;B[jq]C[it is low but he is thick and so close, don't wanna lose much territory down under.

It's about time. This move has been urgent for both players for about 20 moves now.]
(;W[kp]C[Huge mistake by white. This is the worst way to use the big wall. Walls provide influence and give support for fighting. A splitting attack is better.]
;B[jp]C[Nice. Your shape is solid and white's wall is going to waste.]
;W[kn]C[he is using his thickness for territory and I feel relieved for getting rid of the thickness.

Yep. White is making a textbook mistake here. Never build territory from a wall like this. Should have fought instead.]
;B[jn]C[Again with the contact move. This time it's even worse. Variation shown.]

after a point of game I begin to play fast and I always give away what I earned. that is why I have a series of lost games...

a few points is ok but the ajis of these stones were so valuable to get in.]

I tought that I would lose till now but he begins a series of mistakes with last 2 moves because of carelesness I think.

that is not the way I want to win or lose, he plays better than me I want to win by my tricks not his faults. and I want to know my own mistakes.]

QUESTION: where is the best place to play in the left to close his territory or should I first add some stones about F9 before getting in.

If you play on the left, I would play A. B, however, is much bigger. You could lose those stones if white figured it out.]

You won by a big margin. It wasn't entirely a result of white's mistakes. You did a nice job of taking advantage. Keep up the good work.
