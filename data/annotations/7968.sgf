C[Hi there,
I played this game with 2 class stronger oponent, as I'm bored with playing oponents with the same strength. My questions are:

1. Direction of play
 - as usual I want to know if I made any mistakes in sense of direction

2. Efficiency of stones
 - did I play the right shapes ?

[kb\]:  Hi Elvard,
I think there are several things you can do to improve your game:
- Don't confuse "light" with "thin".  Light is good, thin is bad - I'll talk more about that when the lower right play commences.
- I think you are too jealous of your opponent's territory.  Go is not just about destroying your opponent's possibilities.  You'll get more enjoyment when you can find the right balance here.]
;B[pd];W[qp]C[I want to invite white at D4...];B[dp]C[... and he accepted.]
;W[cd]LB[dc:B][cd:A]C[Considering, I want to play at komoku, which one is better, A or B ?

I like A for his symmetry...

[kb\]: Cross openings tend to become fighting games, and since Black is on two star points. I actually wouldn't mind playing Black now.
I don't like either A or B and would play at the star point instead for balance.  However, if komoku is your game, either one is fine.]
;B[op];W[mq]TR[ec]LB[no:C][lp:B][mq:A]C[I was thinking about A and B, but B has quiet complicated josekis, so I played A expecting black C

[kb\]: This pincer is too close.  It is too easy for White to come under counter-attack.  If you're wary of the josekis after B, then you can play E17 instead and have a regular game.]
(;B[no]LB[ip:B][jp:A]C[As I expect this move, I was prepared for play at A or B, but I'm not sure, which one is better.

A is more solid, while B creates light shape. Is it just matter of taste, or is one move better than other? Are there any other options ?

[kb\]: Neither are good moves or joseki.

Black's play could also be at P3 since both corners are Black's]
;W[jp]
(;B[hq]C[[kb\]: This move is good, but Black can punish K4 more effectively by playing at R6.]
;W[ed]LB[jc:C][cj:B][pm:A]C[I didn't want to play around A since black can attack both weak groups, so I played 10 aiming at B or C.

[kb\]: ...You started with that corner!  Are you content with giving that whole side to Black?]
;B[qn]C[[kb\]: Black has a very successful opening.];W[cn]
(;B[cp]C[[kb\] ...but this move I do not agree with.  Black's side is already quite strong, since the balance of power on the bottom is his, so I would prefer a pincer here.]
;W[ck]C[I never know, how to answer this black solid shimari. Black is thick so I play also thick... Are there any other options ?]
;B[ho];W[fq]C[As black secure his territory, I wanted utilize some aji there. I saw this move in one Go Seigen's game, probe to see, how black will react and also (for me the only reason) to get some forcing move outside...

[kb\]: It's hard to play moves like this when you are so weak.  I understand the intention but I think Black can easily stop this move.]
(;B[fp];W[iq]
(;B[hr]C[[kb\]: This is a big mistake.];W[ep];B[eo];W[gp];B[eq]
;W[hp]C[[kb\]: With this move, White got way more than expected.  You should rejoice!]
;B[gq];W[fr];B[er];W[go];B[io];W[ir];B[fs]
(;W[jo]C[Is it a good forcing move?

[kb\]: No, since it just helps Black's shape.];B[im]C[Black seems to be forced to good shape, and n3 looks too close to my wall... But still I was afraid of black playing at K5

[kb\]: The position is unclear, but I think Black is still leading slightly.  White's R4 stone is not happy.]
;W[ip];B[jn];W[hs]TR[iq][ir]C[I played these stones in sente and get queit solid territory. But was these exchanges good for white ? Or didn't I help black more then myself ?

[kb\]: This play is pretty small now, since both groups have been resolved.]
;B[dj];W[dk]TR[ck][cn]C[[kb\]: This connection need not be strengthened and there is no territory on the left, so White should just respond with C10.]
;B[ej];W[bi];B[jc];W[qf]LB[qp:A]C[I had to reduce black's growing moyo. I wanted to utilize A stone's aji, so I approach at the right side. But could I play some forcing moves around A first ? See next move...]
;B[qi]C[Becase now, black plays hasami and my chances for utilizing some aji in lower right corner were very smal..

[kb\]: This is a good Black move.];W[qd]C[Is it better approach than san-san invasion ? I don't like black's moyo with thick wall facing to it...

[kb\]: This is a reasonable move, yes.];B[qc];W[rc];B[qe];W[rd]
;B[pe];W[pc];B[qb]C[[kb\]: Should just be at P17.];W[pb]C[[kb\]: Now S15 is sente, so Black should take it.]

;B[mb];W[of];B[mc];W[oe];B[pg];W[pf]C[Up to here, black made some mistakes (I think). I have nice, solid position, while black has one very low position and one weak group...

[kb\]: Yes, this is very good for White.  The position is now good for you.]
;B[pq]
(;W[ql]LB[qp:A]C[Now I desperately tried to utilize A stone...

[kb\]: You are leading now, so it's not necessary to be desperate.
See variation for a more modern approach.];B[qm]C[Expected reaction. Has black any better move ?]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[ok]C[Too heavy?];B[ni];W[oj]LB[mh:B][nh:A][oj:C]
C[I get nice shape in sente, again black mistake? should black played A, B or C instead ?

[kb\]: If Black just connects, it's OK.]
(;B[ng]C[[kb\]: This move looks fancy but doesn't help to pressure the weak White group.]
;W[ml]LB[mj:A][om:B]C[I wanted to play at A or B];B[mj];W[rj]
C[But I tried to make some eyeshape first...];B[om]C[Suprisingly, black didn't answer 80, so my groups are now connected. Was it mistake ?

[kb\]: Yes- P7 was a good move for you.];W[ol];B[nm];W[mk];B[kj]
;W[kl]C[I wanted to separate black];B[ln];W[or];B[pr];W[oq]
;B[pp];W[il]C[This move looks very bad, as it just helps black to enlarge his moyo, should I simply connect at s12 ?

[kb\] This move is just dame - just connect.];B[ij];W[rh];B[ri]
;W[si];B[rg];W[qg];B[qh];W[sh];B[me]LB[ij:2][il:1]C[Now the 1-2 exchange looks very sad...

[kb\]: This move is actually smaller than Black playing at G17.  G17 is very large.]
;W[hc]C[Black is forming another moyo and I needed to reduce it... Is there any better move to achieve this goal ?
[kb\]: This is the best move on the board.  Black's "moyo" cannot be any bigger than 20 points.]
;B[bd]C[This was strange move, I know C17 probe, but not this one...
[kb\]: This move is a good probe.];W[bc];B[ce];W[dd];B[ch]
(;W[rl]C[[kb\]: Big but gote.  I would prefer to jump to the center or push once on the left side.]

(;B[fc]LB[bc:2][bd:1][dd:4][ce:3]C[This invasion looks quiet late, after 1 to 4 exchanges. I was confident, that it's just black's overplay, so I tried to kill him. Was I wrong and this is correct invasion ? In this case, H17 move is wrong...

[kb\]: You can kill this Black stone.  Black's move should be at H18.]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[fe];B[hb]TR[be]C[[kb\]: No stone to secure the Black hane on the left, so you can kill all of them with B.]
