C[Hello dear reviewer,thanks for your time.
During the game I felt slightly ahead but in the end I lost by 1.5 points.
I felt I gave my best in this game and I would be glad to receive some thoughts from a stronger player.

SGF: I am not sure I am that much stronger than the participants (my KGS account is 3d but I rarely play with it).   But I will offer what comments I have and hope that they are of some use.]

SGF: In anticipation of white jumping out I think I would be more inclined to consider a wider pince on the star point.  That feels like a better balance with the bottom to me.]

(;B[qe]C[SGF:  This looks natural, but it also cause to me stop and think.  With the extra stone at M16 I don't think white is likely to slide to S16, but instead would jump in at the 3-3 and black can take the territory at the top.  In view of this I think I would be more inclined to play at Q8 before white gets the chance to play in there.]

(;B[qm]C[I was trying to find a good move for this situation,r7 felt right

SGF: I don't like this.  It seems too low.  It is too far from the corner to secure anything but doesn't seem to help around S9 because the territory is undercut.  Forcing wS14 has weakened Q11 without doing too much for black.  I think that black must play Q8.]

(;W[pm]C[SGF: Seems strange to me.  Contact moves are usually reserved for when there is a need to survive in a confined area.  That is not the case here.  Given that the right side is undercut at the top I would be inclined to play P4.]

(;B[ql]C[SGF:  This seems to contradict the purpose behind R7, which presumably was meant to work with the corner.  Moving towards Q11, which is undercut does not seem productive.]
;W[pn];B[pl]C[SGF: I think this gives white too many options to lay waste to the lower side but after R8 it is hard to know what else to do.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pp]
(;B[rp]C[SGF: Seems like the wrong extention.  See the variation.]
;W[oq];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[lq];B[op]TR[no]SQ[nm][lo]C[perhaps it was too early?

SGF:  Maybe not too early as much as too direct.  But what is white going to do here if black plays elsewhere?  My inclination would be to leave the situation as it is for now and later aim at the triangle point.  If black can get that point then either of the square points makes good shape.]

;B[im];W[ml];B[nk]C[I felt b is ahead now,i gained full corner while w gained floating group

SGF: White group is not floating as he can live anytime as shown.  But black has gained a big corner,. If he is not careful it is blacks lower left group which could come under attack.]

(;W[lj];B[kl];W[mk];B[cf];W[nj];B[ok];W[ch];B[cc]C[Good direction?
I felt i need to grab points here

SGF:  I don't really see any choice here.  It is the subsequent moves which caused the problem.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[hj];B[em]LB[fm:A]C[SGF: Seems like a strange move to me.  It basically invites white to solidify the left side.  If black ignores white then A looks like the vital point for white and so I think this is where black should play.  It is very close to guaranteeing life and leave the left side still open to reduction or invasion.]
;W[hl]C[SGF: Not sure what the point of this is.  Why not just play D7?]
;B[dm];W[cm]
(;B[en]C[SGF: I think black has to play C8.  It increases the value of the cut at C15 in addition to reducing whte more.]
;W[cn]
(;B[hm]C[Perhaps c15 is better?
I didnt want to leave my group under attack

SGF: True, but I think this is too passive.  Test white first to see how he reacts.  There is a remote possibility that the two white stones become a liability, so see how white intends to play first.]
;W[ce];B[fc];W[jd]
(;B[hc]C[SGF:  The corner is alive so inviting white to split the to group cannot be good.  Playing K17 and taking the top side seems better.  But black also needs to consider the territory white can develop in the upper left quadrant.  I would try one of the moves in the variations.]
