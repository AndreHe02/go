C[Radu:
I find you playing very clean and solid. It is obvious that you masters the basics of the life-and-death situations and also you value the tactical sequences (connections, cut, joseki). At the tactical level, without few slips - I mentioned them in the comments - nothing to comment. About the areas you could improve, three things I noticed as very big:
- value the sente. Don't give up sente for few territory points, sente is the way to take initiative and lead the game. Using the sente means to, at one moment in time, to count the situation, to look after the most urgent areas and to try to move so to preserve the sente. Force the opponent being in gote and it will be your choice where to play
- don't overlook the life of your groups. Make life when it becomes vital, but when the fight is just starting look for a balance between the safety of a base and the extension toward the center. What would be the gain to have a sure life group contained in a square of 6x6 places?
- always play against your opponent, and not alone on the table. In this game, your opponent played a scattered opening with no moyos on the sides but lot of high played pieces. Your answers were mostly on 3rd line, even 2nd. Too low, almost submissive. Indeed, getting the sides is a way to counter the opponent choice, but don't neglect limiting him. The open doors should have been used for making deep intrusions in his moyo, and not to gain few more points to your own moyos.]
;B[dd]C[GoToFail [16k\]: удачной игры];W[pq];B[cp]
;W[oe]C[R: rather experimental move, is maybe too high ofr a fuseki. Hoshi is too good to not play]
;B[pd]C[R: good, W can aim for influence toward center, but B should be able to slip under]
;W[pe];B[od];W[jj]TR[qe]C[R: W keeps pushing for influence, but is too soon, B should quickly slip under at R15]
;B[eq];W[gq];B[kq]TR[lp][np]C[RL good intention, in order to cancel the W influence I would have played one line upper]
;W[jq]
(;B[kr]C[R: wrong direction, go up. E3, L3 and now L2 are too low, they are submissive. See alternative]
;W[jp];B[nq];W[or];B[nr]C[R: B is not yet live, W gained a high position, not too bad for W]
;W[ql];B[cj];W[cf]SQ[fd]TR[dg]C[R: kind of desperate move, I would have opting for F16 instead which would also have some kind of relation with tengen. Now B can severly hit at D13 completing very nice the left side formation]
;B[gc]TR[fc]C[R: It is again a submissive move. W attacks and B continues to play low and allow W makes footholds.
This move also looks not well balanced between hoshi D16 and the right corner formation. It doesn't help decisive neither of them]
;W[cc]TR[cd]C[R: W plays well, allowing B tke the corner, but making solid ground on left. I would prefer cut at C16 at least for the sake of getting a higher position]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[jc]CR[od][nq][cj]SQ[ha][hb][hc][ic][ia][ib][jb]
[ja][gb][ga]TR[qe][pg][ne][oo][qi][ej]C[R: Again too submissive. THink of groups which needs support (the circled one). Left corners groups don't need futher assistance. Anyway, B is in no danger anywhere, so B shouldn't give up sente for 10-12 points. Triangles: multiple choices]
;W[me];B[md];W[ne];B[nd]C[R: Here is obvious that W vhoice to 5x5 was not the best. B gained huge territory and W has not yet a powerfull wall, but just a row of stones under B pressure]
;W[cm];B[cg];W[ca]C[R: this move I don't understand. Well, after B descending, it can use the sente]

(;B[df];W[de]
(;B[dg]C[R: first give the atari];W[ee]C[R: this is why. B is cut and shouldn't have]
;B[ed]TR[fd]C[R: bad shape. BetterF16];W[fe]TR[fd]C[R: W fails to make use, should have go to F16]
;B[je]TR[qe][qg][pg][ph][oo][em][dl][dm]C[R: intention is good, better points are triangle]
;W[fd];B[fc];W[eb];B[ec];W[db];B[fb]C[R: W obtained more than hoped. Because B fail to give 2 safe sente at D18 and E15]
;W[ea]
(;B[fa]C[R: this is one of small mistakes but with big impact. This move is worth few points, B gives away sente for too small territory.]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[he];B[hd]C[R: W wasn't sente, can be ignored and go in other high value points]
;W[id];B[ic];W[gd]C[CaoCao [17k\]: Прости.

;B[co];W[eo];B[ep]TR[fp][mo][kg]SQ[li][ni][ok][om][kk][km]C[R: now it was a moment for B to think: what is W aiming for? W has small moyo left up corner, and one smaller in right down. B has a huge moyo in upper side, a medium on left side and a medium one left down corner. Looks like B is way ahead. But W has a huge outlined moyo in center, It is up to B to limit it. B has only 3 doors: F4, L13 and N5. Outside a pure invasion (like rectangles). B should not shut the doors himself, like this move.]
;W[fo];B[kp]C[R: the intention is correct, but the execution is too slow, Should have much higher.]
;W[kn];B[qh]C[R: good invasion, and still not too late.];W[oh]
;B[pi];W[qj];B[qf];W[qe];B[re];W[qd]

;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[ld];B[lc];W[kd];B[kc]TR[nb]SQ[le]
C[R: B should be careful about this nasty aji: O18. In this moment, not in danger as long as has M15]
;W[lf];B[no];W[ri];B[rh];W[si];B[sh];W[rk];B[rd];W[rc]
(;B[rf]C[R: this connection doesn't give eye shape and anyway it was not urgent to make eye shape]
;W[sd];B[se];W[qg];B[pg];W[sg]C[R: worthless move];B[rg];W[ph]
;B[pf];W[og];B[oi];W[mi]C[R: again B should stop ann count. B lost big in right up corner, but at least made a succesfull invasion on right.]
;B[nj];W[ni];B[oj];W[mg]TR[jg][ir][kl][gf]C[R: B has sente, should no limit the moyo in center left]
