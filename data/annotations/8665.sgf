C[DT - Hello, madison, and nice to meet you.
Some of my friends on KGS helped me study this game - "Sandmann" and "ikami" (both 6d), among others - so I want to take this opportunity to thank them all for their kindness.
Needless to say, I alone am responsible for any errors in this review. I hope that you enjoy it and learn something new.
At the end of the game (last move) you can find a summary (with advice) that may help you improve.
I hope this review is clear, but if you have any questions please feel free to contact me.
Best regards,
DanielTom.];B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[cp];B[ic];W[cg]
(;B[ed];W[dj]
(;B[ep]TR[dj]C[DT - Your move is fine but usually, when White has the marked stone in place, Black shouldn't play so close (see variation).]
;W[hp]
(;B[dn]TR[dj]C[DT - I think that here this move is an overplay.
There is a smart move in this position for Black that is worth learning: see variation.]
;W[eo];B[do];W[dp]
(;B[fp]
(;W[bn]C[DT - Terrible move by White! For sure White should cut you (save the cutting stone) and welcome any fight.
See variation!]
(;B[fn]LB[gn:A]C[DT - This result is great for Black.
Your move, however, is maybe a bit too bookish. Later (after the two peeps) Black's shape became weird.
ikami suggests Black A instead (see variation).];W[go];B[fo]
;W[nq];B[qj];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[kc]
(;B[ie]LB[je:A]C[DT - This move is a bit passive (it doesn't put much pressure on White).
Locally, Black A is better (see variation).];W[ke]
(;B[eg]LB[cm:B][qn:A]C[DT - You played another passive move here. Again, this is bad since it is not attacking anything nor is it making any territory.

By the way, if you really want to attack White, you should first separate his groups with a play around B. In my opinion, that point is actually very important for the both sides.
Your move (29) only forces White to play at B himself, and he should be happy to do so.

Right now, however, extending at R7 is the biggest move, and playing there would be better (see variation).]
;W[em];B[en]LB[fn:A]C[DT - Now you can see that after all your shape is not good here.
See variation for move 17 (A) again.];W[qc]LB[cm:A][qm:B]C[DT - The timing for this move is probably wrong...
Extending at the right side from the shimari is still the biggest move.
(Also, White A is almost sente and would make his group safe.)]
(;B[ob]LB[ke:B]TR[kc][nc][nd]C[DT - It is not easy to attack the marked group (keep in mind that White already has a stone at B), so your move is not the best.
Black Q17 is the strongest move in this position.
See variations.];W[qe];B[pe];W[rf]
(;B[qd]C[DT - It is better to skip this move (it makes White stronger).
See variation.];W[rd];B[qf];W[re];B[rg];W[rb]
(;B[mf]LB[kg:A]C[DT - Bad move! Is this the losing plan?
You are only forcing White to escape and take the vital point (A)...
You should have played at A yourself, and deliver a much more powerful attack (see variation).]
;W[kg];B[li]TR[mf]C[DT - Stange moves.];W[ki];B[lj]
(;W[qm]LB[ji:B][kj:A]C[ikami - White should at least push once more (at A). See variation.
DT - Now Black has to come up with a good attacking plan. There are several options, please see the variations for Black's next move.
The conclusion we reached is that Black should try B, a tesuji.]
(;B[jp]C[ikami - I feel that they focused too much on the side...
DT - Please see the variations for this move. There are nice plans here for Black to consider.]
(;W[iq]LB[iq:A][jq:B]C[DT - Bad move by White. This kind of move is never good...
ikami - Yes, the A-B exchange is crude.
See variations for better alternatives.];B[jq];W[hm]
(;B[gq]LB[gq:A][ir:B]C[DT - This move is also crude, it is better to skip it. See variations.]
;W[ir]LB[gq:A][ir:B]C[ikami - The A-B exchange helps White, so it is not good for Black. It doesn't even make one eye.]
;B[no]
(;W[po]LB[op:A]C[DT - White made a mistake here. Locally White A is honte.]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[nr]C[DT - Good way to get sabaki.];W[or];B[np]
;W[ns];B[oq];W[nr];B[lq]LB[gn:C][hn:B][ho:D][lr:A]C[DT - I am not sure if this move is good.
Sandmann - It ensures A is sente, so later Black may try the B-C-D combination.
DT - Anyway, I feel that Black already lost his best chance to attack...]

;W[kk];B[gn];W[hn];B[io];W[ho]TR[gn][hn][io]C[DT - These moves only made you destroy all the aji... Not good for you (aji keshi).]
;B[gl];W[hl];B[cm];W[bm];B[cl]LB[ch:B][ci:C]C[DT - It's a pitty that Black never created the chance to attack White at C or B...]
;W[ci];B[fj]C[DT - Another slack move];W[bk];B[bl];W[al];B[pl]
LB[pq:A]C[DT - I think you should play the probe at A first.]
;W[pm];B[ol];W[be];B[bd];W[ce];B[de];W[ll]C[DT - A painful move.]
;B[lg];W[kh];B[kf];W[jf];B[lf];W[je];B[ig];W[jg];B[ml];W[lm]
;B[mm];W[if];B[jd]C[DT - Bad habit: you have a tendency to play forcing moves that don't actually help you.]
;W[kd];B[hf];W[he];B[gf];W[id];B[ge];W[rk]
(;B[rj]C[DT - You can't win if you keep playing gote!

(;W[jl]LB[kn:A]C[DT - White could play kosumi at A.];B[ln];W[ds]
;B[fr];W[sg];B[rh];W[mb]C[DT - White played better yose and the game is now hopeless for Black.
Later you made some minor yose mistakes, but nothing worth mentioning.

[fq][er][gr][fs]C[DT - Here are the lessons you can take from this game:

1 - Be particularly careful when playing inside your opponent's sphere of influence and avoid making overplays (see, e.g. , move 11);

2 - Connect with good shape, but see if your move is actually the best in that particular situation, or if you are being too "bookish" (e.g. move 17);

3 - Avoid playing passive moves! That includes "empty" moves, like stones "floating in the air" that are not really doing anything (e.g., move 29). To solve this problem, you can replay more pro games played by "aggressive" masters (Yu Ch'ang-hyeok 9p, for example);

4 - Remember that to gain thickness usually you must sacrifice something else (in this game, with P18, you lost the corner), so you must use that thickness to its full potential! See move 43: you played another "empty" move, instead of taking the chance to attack White severely (with a cap);

5 - Try to come up with a winning strategy. Look for dual-purpose moves! And make sure that your own groups are strong before delivering a powerful attack! (see variation3 for move 49);

6 - Avoid playing crude moves. Moves 50 and 53 were of that kind (usually it is best to simply skip them);

7 - Never allow your groups to be shut in! Jump out, divide and conquer! (See variation2 for move 53);

8 - When you want to play a forcing move, see if that move is actually kikashi or if it only helps your opponent. On a similar note, do not peep at cutting points! See moves 77 and 79 - as a rule, it is a good idea to keep as many possibilities as possible open for the future, so try to avoid aji-keshi;

9 - Finally, take the time to learn some basic endgame tesuji if you can. Learning only a few of them can really change the outcome of many games. Remember to avoid slack moves, and always try to keep sente!

I hope that you have enjoyed the review. In the end, it does not matter if you won or lost the game. Just keep playing, learning, and have fun!
