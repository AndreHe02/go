;B[me];W[md];B[oc];W[ob];N[RESULT]C[Result: W+Resign

Your main mistakes in this game were in playing moves that were too small.  There were several times where you had sente and could have sealed off a large territory in the center, but you took smaller points instead.  Then when White invaded on the right, you tried to take his eyes, which drove him out into the center and made for an all-or-nothing fight.  If you let White live small on the right, you will get sente, and you will have sealed off the center while he played moves to live.  Then you could play to make the territory at the top smaller.  There's also a good chance that if you seal White in he will be unable to live.  Your life and death skills seem to be pretty strong, so that may have worked out for you.]
