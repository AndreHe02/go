AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]PL[W];W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[de]C[A bit small.  I'd play C15, or 14 if you wanna be safer.  In this case, since you also have the lower left corner, a move at C10 would be reasonable.]
;W[cb];B[bc];W[qn];B[qq]C[Defensive play, but almost too defensive since it doesn't do very much as it takes away territory and allows white to move further in.  Try the Joseki R5, or O3 works as well.]
;W[qk];B[jp]C[Good, big move.];W[cn];B[cj]C[Very good move, stretching your thickness from the upper left and pincering W11.  C9 probably would've been better, though, since white can move at C9 and build a base.]
;W[qf];B[qc];W[fq];B[cq];W[fo];B[en];W[gn];B[dm];W[cm];B[cl]
;W[bl];B[ck];W[bp]C[The mistakes started real son in the game ^^` . The next play was a mistake and I compromited all this corner. What`s the best play here?

Well, at this point the corner is pretty much lost.  I would suggest E5 to make sure you're connected probably.  Losing the corner here is ok, since you'll end up with thickness on the left side, and whites influence from the F5 goup is negated by your K4.  Fighting to hard for the corner will force you to live small and allow white to strengthen her stones.]
;B[co];W[bn];B[bo]C[That was worse...

Actually, these moves thus far are reasonable, as long as you keep in mind you may get disconnected from your escape route at E6.]
;W[ao];B[am];W[bq];B[br];W[fe];B[eg]C[Good response.  Maybe F14 would be a bit more severe.]
;W[cp];B[dr];W[do];B[eo]C[?];W[ep];B[eq];W[dq]C[O_o

So yeah, it would've been better to connect earlier.  White utilized aji really well.  In the long run, Go is about efficiency of movements.  However, until you get to 10k+, being safe is better than being sorry since you'll usually miss something.  Eventually, as you gain more experience, you'll know for sure that you're ok or not, and then someone will throw a curveball at you and you'll have to relearn everything x.x  

Just kidding.];B[hq];W[er];B[jc]C[I have to say, you're making good, big moves here.  A lot of people below 15k try to play small and safe, so this is good.]
;W[gc];B[mc]C[Unnecessary, but if you'd rather play safe, M16 would've been better.  This works though, and the difference between the two moves are minimal.]
;W[on];B[mp];W[of];B[jf];W[fm];B[em];W[fl];B[el];W[fk];B[ek]
;W[fj]C[You're losing this race.  White is building thickness and influence to the center, and you're gaining single points of territory.  Finish the race with F11, make sure you're connected with D12, or just ignore.]
;B[gg];W[bb];B[ab];W[nh];B[mf];W[mk];B[ln]C[Right now you're playing reactionary Go, which is ok for short periods of time but won't win you games.  Pick someplace to attack and go for it.  An assault at Q12 a while ago might've worked well, or something to prevent white in building the moyo she now has there.]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[ic];B[id];W[hd];B[ie];W[gr];B[re]C[Small move.  Start building something in the center, or try and poke a whole in white's defenses on the right.]
;W[js]C[I hate that...
And here, how can sto that?

This is called the monkey jump, and the best thing you can do is learn it.  Amazing move, as I'm sure you now know.  A response at H2 would've not allowed that, albeit being a small gote move.]
;B[jr];W[is];B[ir];W[hs];B[kr]C[You reacted best you could.]
;W[rf];B[ro];W[ks];B[lr];W[ls];B[mr];W[op];B[ms];W[po];B[qo]
C[You need to connet your two groups here, white can easily cut at P3 and your corner will probably die, or live small.  Play P3 to prevent that from happening.]
;W[oq]TR[mh][hi][hn][lj][mj]SQ[nm]C[The bot invade all my bad shape. How can I played to avoid that kind of invasion? And how to expand it?

You don't have that bad of shape, really.  You just need to realize when two groups are about to be cut, which is a hard thing to learn and only experience can tell.  Learn well from this game, and try to always assess groups that you may have already accepted as "alive" or "connected", because the game can change quick.  I've marked a couple of the moves that would expand your territory effectively.  A lot of them don't immediately gain you territory, but from experience I can tell you they will give you some in the long run.  Play with a couple of them, and see what you think.  I particularly like the square, since it also will do some damage to white's moyo.  Check the variations for some of the things I fiddled with.]
(;B[or];W[pq];B[qp];W[pr];B[os];W[qr];B[rr]C[Leave it, this shape is now dead.]

Very good use of aji.];W[ql];B[rm];W[pm];B[si];W[nn];B[mm];W[ja]
;B[ka];W[ia];B[kb];W[ej];B[di];W[bk];B[bj];W[qe];B[rd];W[lh]
;B[rk]C[I'd worry about white K12 right here, it would put a pretty big hole in your potential territory.]
;W[rj];B[sj];W[qi];B[rh]C[I have to say, very good use of aji to get that group alive again.  I wouldn't have seen that coming.]
;W[in];B[jl];W[il];B[jm];W[im];B[jn];W[ik];B[jk];W[io];B[jo]
;W[qd];B[od];W[se];B[sd]C[O_o];W[rc]TR[sd][rd][re]C[Yeah, something to watch out for.  Remember this sequence, because you'll see it more.  This shape gets captured all the time because it's hard to see it's liberties taken.]
;B[rb];W[sc];B[qh];W[pi];B[ph];W[ng];B[gi];W[qb]TR[rb][qc][pd]
C[Again...

Just watch this shape and recognize the aji it leaves, a move at Q18 is always good when you see this shape.  Avoid it unless it has serious benefits, since it'll be gote with Q18.  BTW, if you don't know all the words I use, Sensei's Library is a good resource if you haven't found it yet.]

;W[qm]C[Watch this shape, it can still be killed with White T7.  If I don't see it happen, I'll come back and put a variation in to make the point.]
;B[ak];W[sm]C[That was the end...

Ah, yup.  This is a false eye.  If you don't know what that means, check Sensei's, they have a pretty good tutorial.]
;B[sl];W[sf];C[Result: W+Resign

I'd say this was a very good game, with just a few minor mistakes that cost you.  This game shows how the difference between two adjacent moves can be very large.  Just remember, try to take the initiative and go on the offense whenever you get the chance.  Try just thinking that over your next couple games.  Also, always be reevaluating groups and make sure they can live on their own, or that they are connected to a living group.  You were fortunate on the side, I would've played differently than white did as you'll see on the variation.  I think you saw the mistakes you made, and I hope I helped you fix them.  Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions.  Best of luck,
