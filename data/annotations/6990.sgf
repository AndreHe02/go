AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[This is a game I played last saturady at local club.
I started this game against Sanda [~11k\], later he switched his place with Ellisar[9k\], who actually knocked me out.

I mention some fight that I didn't like. Allowing white to get a big moyo was also bad.

Blue: Hi, I'm Alex Rodgers, aka Bluebottle. I'll be your reviewer.]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[ck];B[nc]C[I also thought about ogeima at C13 or making sanrensei with Q10.
Couldn't really say which one is better or whether it is just matter of style.

Blue: I'd say it is just a matter of style. I like your choice: in a handicap game, secure moves like O17 that make profit are preferred. Also, C13 could lead to complications (not necessarily a bad thing, but in a handicap game, it's not needed). A sanrensei makes influence towards the only white stones, so I would not do that yet.]
;W[cf];B[fc]C[Maybe just F16 is better here?

Blue: I think so. You have the support from the top right.]
;W[jd];B[pj];W[qn];B[ql]C[Blue: This feels a little narrow, in that it is too close to Q10, making that move worth less.]
;W[on];B[pm]C[Blue: I haven't seen this response before, and I feel it isn't good. As you saw, it is not sente, because W can sacrifice P6 and live inside. If a move is not sente, it must achieve something, and this doesn't really do that.

You are already strong above, and weak below. So I would prefer a move that supports Q4. O4 is traditional, you could go for O3 to keep high-low balance on the bottom.]

;W[op];B[jq];W[pg];B[qe];W[qg];B[bp]C[I think that White at B4 would be painful.

Blue: Well, it's not too painful. But B at B4 prevents it while making a lot of territory. If you are ahead in a game, and there are no urgent moves, look for a move like this that makes a good chunk of solid points.]

C[I misread the following battle and lost considerate ammount of points.

Blue: This is a point I'd like to hammer home, and it's really important in handicap games. If you are ahead, like way ahead, don't complicate things. A simple move like L4 secures territory, halts the advance into the left, and leaves him with the boring option of up. Following him up on the left, or harrasing the up from the right while tidying up that group, is nice and safe.]
;W[jo];B[ko]C[Looks like this move was a mistake. I get no good continuation after this.

Blue: I agree, I prefer J5.];W[kp];B[io];W[jp];B[ip];W[kq]C[Right here.]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[iq];W[gl];B[in]C[Maybe better something like H7? But I was afraid of cut K6.

Blue: I'd say if the right got cut, it could go to the right for safety.]

;W[lf];B[pc]C[Maybe too careful.

Blue: Too true. If you don't think you could defend the setup as is from the 3-3 invasion, practice until you can. A good knowledge of when the 3-3 invasion works, depending on support for the 4-4, is very valuable. Just try things out, either with someone else, on your own, or with a book or Sensei's library.]
;W[lg]
(;B[ng];W[nf];B[cm];W[kk]TR[kg][ng][ki][jk]C[That's where Ellisar came into play. After this move I lost triangled stones. Which decided the game.

Blue: These stones were always in trouble. They aren't strongly connected to a solid group. I show a branch which keeps a lot of them safe, but there are a lot of variations.

You may find it a useful exercise in game to just quickly take the role of your opponent and think "How can I disrupt that connection?" You don't have to actually do it, but if you quickly find yourself unsure of how such an attack would go, it's a signal to look at it more thoroughly.]

[is]C[Blue: That was a really neat game, I enjoyed it. Summing up some main points:

If you have a big lead (i.e. 30+), be it from a handicap or an early kill, focus solely on consolidation. Count: if he gets all of his maybe territory, and you get all of yours, and you get all of yours, and the lead is huge, make that happen. Don't risk bits to gain a greater lead. (Obviously if you don't, keep playing normally.)

You are really cautious sometimes. More games will give you a better feel for what is safe and what isn't. If you are prepared to lose a few casual games, just be less cautious, and you will learn what is safe.

Otherwise, keep playing, keep having fun!
