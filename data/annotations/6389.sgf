AB[dp][pd]C[Thank you for taking the time to review my game.


You're welcome.

Main points :

- Study joseki
- Study life & death
- Really have in mind that playing sente moves is VERY important
- Learn how to count roughly (+-20 points should be enough for now).]

no, you did not resign too early :) the game is over at that point (I mean, literally over, it's time to count points)

The right time to resign was from move 70])

R14 or Q14 are typical answers. Remember that in an handicap game, you must play more defensively than in a regular game, and you must try to avoid playing the tsuke (a contact stone) without a plan in mind.  

You have to study a few josekis (only a couple of 3-4 and 4-4 josekis will be enough for the moment), it can be useful at your level]
