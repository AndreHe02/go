;W[dp]C[R:

hi, 

my kgs nickname is schwing. I'm going to review this game. 
When looking through the game, I get the impression that it was a pretty convenient one for you. I think that w, whatever the reason, lost the game mentally very soon. Part of the reason for sure was your superior outcome of the first few moves.

The question about the oppening and some pointers throughout the game were the reason I agreed to the review. Nonetheless I would encourage you to submit games that were -- if even won -- won at most by a small margin. Those are typically the games that are (1) most interesting and that (2) induce a higher probability to reveal ones own weaknesses. In my experience, for the gain of strength it is most efficient for stronger players to comment on those weaknesses.

best,
schwing 
P.S.: my comments will be initialized by an "R:"];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[oc]C[R: so far, everything's fine. Now follow some moves that can be summarized as a lack of direction. Note that the main direction of the komoku is facing the top, as the corner isn't enclosed yet. That is, black is striving on finishing the corner with a shimari. For further insight in the theory of direction, see "Direction of play" by Kajiwara Takeo.]
;W[qj]C[R: first, R10, in this position, is not seen very often amon dan-players.]
(;B[qh]C[R: The reason why in this position I would feel more comfortable by approaching the stone from the bottom -- besides finishing the shimari -- is that I would'nt be so sure on how to answer R5]
(;W[qm]C[R: well. Approaching the corner is a must. W made the last crucial mistake in this position.]
;B[qo]C[R: black gets its shimari in sente];W[oj];B[oh]C[R: there are bigger moves on the board. Those wanted by both Players (linke K4). First slack move by b]
;W[jp]
(;B[dj]C[R: Same with R10. I'd rather approached D15.];W[ce]
;B[cn];W[fq]
(;B[dn]C[R: bit slow];W[jd];B[gd];W[ch];B[ci]
(;W[jf];B[gf]
(;W[lc]
(;B[lq]C[R: I think, now is the time for D12. If w D12, the running-fight becomes more intense and w is the attacking-side. M3 is big, but D12 additionaly is urgent.]
(;W[jr];B[iq];W[jq];B[go]C[Is this a good move?

R: cf. move 17. But yes, I like it. Also, w D12 still strong, but there's another black helping stone.]
(;W[fo];B[fn];W[eo];B[gm];W[hn];B[gn];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip];B[dh]
;W[fc]C[R: w keeps playing those moves. neither c12 nor f17 have any significant continuation]

(;B[lo];W[no];B[pk];W[pj];B[pn];W[nm];B[lm]
(;W[ol];B[jn]C[here I tried to connect my groups wasn't sure about this move

R: shape. Cf. the last w move of the alternative branch of move 43]
(;W[mf]C[R: slow but important. The group can become weak... But I don't think w recognized the potential black center-territory. Not sure here. I think, here w gave up mentally; there didn't seem to be any resistance in the further moves. So congratiulations; seems like you demoralized your opponent within no more than 50 moves.]
;B[mh]C[is this a good move? because I thought something like p14 was too passive

R: Agree, although P14 would have been enough.];W[pp];B[qp]
;W[oq];B[pr];W[po];B[pm]C[Is r6 better here?

R: do you survive the w cut?]
(;W[rm]C[i wasn't expecting this

R: me neither];B[qn];W[mj];B[jj]C[good move or bad if bad what would be better

R: if w recognices your approach to enclose the center, he should want to fight you for it. I can't tell you here, if there is a really "good" move. Still this seems a bit "one-directional"; that is it doesn't serve any second purpose, such like K12. I'm the kind of player who wants to test the strength of the groups involved in the game. But considering the aim of enclosing territory; this move is fine.]
;W[ki];B[ji];W[pg];B[qg];W[lh]C[here i wasn't sure what my opponent was thinking

R: connect. W was afraid the top-center group might die];B[og]

R: small, indeed; but at least sente.];W[mp];B[ms];W[bh]
(;B[bi]C[should I ignore and play d13 or is tis for the best

R: both valuable. You're ahead. keep it simple]

(;AB[pp]AE[pq]LB[qn:A][nq:B]C[R: with a black stone on the star-point R10 seems more reasonable. Now R10 is a splitting move that is typically played if w doesn't want to decide from which side to attack the Q4. (Here R6-side feels better, same as with the black stone on komuku (3-4)) . However other than the komoku, the star-point doesn't have a main direction. The corner can be settled by a shimari at either A or B.]
;B[qh];W[qn];B[ql];W[on];B[nq];W[pk];B[qo];W[rn])
(;B[qn]C[R: The reason is, why R10 is seldomly played is that black gets the corner enclosure in sente and then can look for the next big pointers.]
