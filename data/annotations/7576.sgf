C[Dear reviewer:
Thanks for taking your time to review my game.
Here, I hold white, and lost terribly...
After reviewing this game, I feel that I played very timid and unecessary moves, and perhaps let black have too much advantage.
While reviewing my game, could you point out some areas I can work on in the future?
Thanks very much!

REVIEWER: Pete, 4k AGA

Ann, happy to review your game. Hope my comments are helpful. Please follow-up via email at pete0877@gmail.com if you have any questions. 


General advice: 

1. look for move efficient moves (e.g. if you created an empty triangle, chances are there was a better move). Always look for moves that accomplish what you NEED plus some more. I have been watching many Dan-level games and I notived very quickly that those players always try to find move that accomplishes a lot of different objectives. 

2. look for plays in open areas (brush up on opening theory a bit).]

(;W[nc]C[PETE: see variation. By playing here you are allowing black to create two strong groups of stones that face eachother (makes it difficult to invide right-side later as you have seen).]

(;W[fd]LB[cf:A][cj:B][fq:C]C[PETE: This move feels too slow. It would be perfect response if black's last move was approach move at. But this move by itself is too slow. You should proabaly play around B. See variation.]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[qk]C[PETE: This invasion will be problematic for white (even though it is necessary). The two black groups are very strong, completed formations with no apparent weaknesses.]
;B[qi];W[qn];B[pl];W[ql];B[pk]
(;W[on]C[PETE: This move definitely invites some trouble as you saw. It might be better to try to create eye-space at the bottom before trying to jump out and become a floating group without eyes.]
;B[pm];W[pn];B[qm];W[rm];B[qj]
(;W[rn]C[PETE: See variation.];B[lq]C[PETE: black is now staring to take advantage of the invasion: black is now letting white live in peace and creates territory in the process.]
(;W[mn]C[-Perhaps at J3 is better?

PETE: well, white group is not alive yet and black might decide to push it around more and make more territory or influence.]
;B[iq];W[hp]LB[ch:A]C[PETE: This move is a bit slow too. It does not create more eye-space, territory or reduce black's territory. If white is trying to connect with the invading stones, black will try to prevent this.

;B[nl];W[ol];B[ok]LB[ch:C][ji:B][nk:A]C[PETE: pushing through like this doesn't work because white cannot cut at A yet. It is better to play elsewhere like B or C.]

(;W[je]C[- H17 better?


PETE: yes, it is more imporant to protect your near-corner territory now. Move at K15 does not really create more than 5 points at best. It does allow the group of invading white stones connect more easily but your bain objective should be to make territory or to kill something beause you (white) are behind on territory points.]

(;W[dc]C[PETE: white should attack black very hard here. White's only chance in this game is to either kill this group or to chase it out far enough to make territory on the left side. See variation.]
;B[gc];W[hb];B[if];W[jf];B[hg];W[dh]LB[cg:B][ch:A]C[PETE: yes, this extension is not very strong because of all the black stones around white. I would probably play at A or B.]

;B[bf]C[I resigned here... the score difference is too big!
Again, thanks for reviewing!

PETE: You did the right thing. I can't see any place where white could make up that many points. 
This game was centered around the invasion white started on the right-side. Because black was so strong on both top and bottom, white had very hard time afterwards (meanwhile black was securing territory).]

(;W[qj]C[PETE: This is how I think most of the opening-theory books advice to respond in this position. Allowing black to play here eventually would be bad for white because it is the perfect extension from the bottom shimary and works well with the top stone as well. This book talks about the value of this move to large extend: http://senseis.xmp.net/?OpeningTheoryMadeEasy]
