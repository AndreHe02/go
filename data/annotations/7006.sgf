C[Hi reviewer!
Thanks for having a look at this game. I'm submitting this game for a review because I think there were quite a few potentially decisive mistakes in direction of play and position assessment on both sides... stuff that is harder to fix via book study but which jumps right out in a game review.

Anyway, see what you think... looking forward to your comments!

steve];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[oc];W[pj]C[***Bob*** Too high. Better R10.]

(;B[fq];W[hq]C[***Bob*** I do not like this kind of moves, besides white is the one why needs to cut all board in peaces as he is back in this stage of game.]

(;B[fo]C[My intention is to profit here by attacking H3. The pattern seems to go a little strange but I'm not sure why. Your view?

***Bob*** F5 I would never play in this position. Better is going in the corner (C3). See above comments.]
;W[eq];B[fr];W[dn];B[kq]C[Maybe this is the odd move?

***Bob*** Looks good for me. Black can play in this way as it is profitable and attacking oriented move in same time.]

(;W[gp]C[***Bob*** Wrong. Initiating opponent to connect on his weak point is not good here. Better simple jump on H5. Still keeping pressure on black stones on F line. 
See previous variations.];B[fp];W[ho];B[fm];W[dl];B[ip];W[hp]
C[***Bob*** Now You can see that white G4 was wrong move];B[hm]
;W[io];B[jp];W[jo];B[ko]C[***Bob*** Pretty bad for white.];W[kn]

(;B[em];W[dm];B[ek]C[About here I start to think that black has made a mistake... too late...

***Bob*** I am not sure if I need to comment this.
But, if you maybe wants to know who is ahead here, it is still not clear.]
;W[gk];B[dk]
(;W[ej]C[***Bob*** Hane is attacking oriented, provides direct defending answer, usually results with settling attacked group.
Black just needed this to help him to provide express life for his weak group.   (See comments above)]

(;B[cb]C[Hm. Mistake? Is there an effective move against r10?

***Bob*** This is defending move to make life for black group. See above comments.]
;W[rg];B[pl];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gd]
(;B[qo]C[Should be r3? Or maybe something to deal with n14 stones is more urgent? (I thought they were safe enough in the game, maybe they were if I hadn't then stuffed up the actual connecting them part...?)

***Bob*** I feel these stones are safe enough.For white there is no way to cut them. But, if one's can have some doubt about it, you can play also good move on L10.]

***Bob*** Yes. White has lot of potential to play ko here.]

***Bob*** Complicated. It is very difficult to find some line for black to kill white group. Nevertheless, black is better here and there is no doubt about winning this game. Only chance for white was saving  his lower left group.]
