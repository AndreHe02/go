C[Hello,
I'm playing white. This game was really close, I lost by 1.5 points (including komi). So I'm wondering what I could have done to get more points. There weren't very many fights. Both black and I played pretty safe imo, but if there are any weak groups that I or my opponent didn't spot, please point them out.

I'll try to explain my thoughts so you understand the decisions made.

Thanks for reviewing the game!

\\m/ : Hi Jonathan,

I'm only 2k on KGS so remember that all the comments following are though off a not strong at all player and not the only truth ;)

To be honest, I wouldn't like to play this game, I would surely feel bored, this was realy too passive and even if you manage to win (yes, you have to be carefull on counting too). But I've done my best to give you advice respecting your playing style, so it's mostly shape advice.

Keep on playin' \\m/];B[pp]C[Sumatakyo [7k\]: hi
Sumatakyo [7k\]: and gg];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq]C[I almost always play 4-4 and 3-4. I just like the balance of influence and potential territory.]
;B[mq];W[qf]C[Black plays a large knight straight from the start. Approaching d3 would be usual for black. Since he didn't do this I decided to separate him by playing r14. I guess r9 or r10 would also have been possible, but I'm not sure what advantage they would offer.

\\m/ : nothing wrong with n3, neither with your move.];B[mc]
C[Again the large knight, I just played as I normally would. Are there any things I should be aware of to exploit when the large knight is played vs the more common small knight (o17)?

\\m/ : large knight very common before the 2 world wars, but it's also the most complicated answer to r14 kakari.]
;W[rd]C[\\m/ : this is treating the large knight move as the small one. It involves a minor loss in territory for w here but has the advantage of keeping the game simple. As long as we're not high dan, it is not a "game losing move" I often play as white here if I just want to stabilise r14 fast and don't want to enter complicated variations]
(;B[cf]C[\\m/ : b should answer at san san.

1/ It takes local advantage on w (because of large knight better placed)
2/ It is sente];W[fc]C[With n17 there, I decided regular small knight would be good. I like to play solid first and then attack after when I see an opening. I thought about the pincer, for e.g. d11 or d12, but played safe considering there are more black stones on top than white.

\\m/ : This is ok];B[di]
(;W[co]C[Close my shimari, aiming for c8 or c9, but he fixes his shape right away.

\\m/ : too mild];B[cl];W[gq]C[I extend in other direction. I thought of playing a larger move like h3, j3, k3. I think the ensuing fight would have been to my benefit to reduce the right, but felt taking the corner with extension was bigger.

\\m/ : j3 is the closest you should extend. Closer is too close ! Still r17 and c15 as good moves]
;B[qq]C[This puzzled me. Very territorial for a 4-4 start. Is this a good move for black?

\\m/ : no, the right san san to play is the upper one. locally speaking r4 and r5 are better shapes here]
;W[qi]C[Again, I might be playing too safe, but I felt that a larger move around r8/r9 would have been making 2 weak groups. However, with r17 open, this might not have been the case.

\\m/ : bigger to stabilise this group with r17, you can launch an attack at l17 on b after]
;B[ql];W[qc]C[\\m/ : finally...];B[pc];W[jc]C[\\m/ : better at l17]
;B[jq]C[Big extension for black as far as I can see, but I believe the game is still balanced.]
;W[lp]C[I wanted to flatten black to pretty big moyo.

\\m/ : if it is to make moyo, you won't be happy with the result... if it is for making strenght at south for attacking n17, good idea]
;B[lq];W[bd]C[Now I take my territory. Also I feel reinforcing the corner strenthens my left group and makes the invasion at h17 more difficult. for black.

\\m/ : aah... so you didn't flattened anything, you just strenghtened and give a stone to b]
(;B[qd]C[\\m/ : free reinforcement, should be at n15];W[rc]
;B[be]
(;W[ce];B[de];W[cd];B[kd];W[jd];B[ke];W[je];B[kf];W[oi]C[I play this threatening to invade in bottom right, but again black protects. Considering the top right group is safe, maybe I should have played somewhere else. Would the Q7 shoulder hit have been good? Is there anywhere else that is major?  D14 is big, and I play that a little later.

\\m/ : q7 is asking for trouble, for reduction here, boshi at b8 is better but this move is ok (maybe better at p14, b still has weaknesses there)]
;B[nl]C[Two space extension. Is there any weakness to exploit here? I don't see any.

\\m/ : it can be cut, but no interest to do it now];W[jp];B[kp]
;W[ko];B[kq];W[jo];B[lo];W[ln];B[mo]
(;W[jl];B[bn];W[bo];B[cn]C[I now see that d6 was big, but didn't play it. I assume that would have been the best move here?

\\m/ : "hane at the head of two stones", if playing it is not working, you should at least prevent it. ( I let you think about what is better here between d5 or d6)]
;W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[bg];W[mn];B[qe]C[\\m/ : arggg];W[re];B[pf]
;W[qg];B[kc];W[on]TR[bn][cn]SQ[bo][co]C[I was worried about black on bottom right and I went to reduce. I now see that it is only worth roughly 10 points maybe(?). So d6 or another big move would have been better I believe.

\\m/ : the first thing to do is to fix shape at the marked stones, you can't let two stones in contact like that. Overelse p6 is ok, it makes the cut at p8 worth thinking now]
;B[qn];W[pg]C[I turn to gain more stones in center and limit size of black top.]
;B[of];W[mi]C[\\m/ : b top is strong and w also, looks like a not urgent 0 point gote play...]
;B[ao]C[Black expoits weakness... ><
Should have played there before the jump at n11.

\\m/ : see earlier comments about that shape];W[bp];B[do];W[dp]
;B[ap];W[aq];B[an];W[eo];B[hp];W[hq];B[dn];W[bq];B[km]C[First and only (?) fight. My objective: stay connect and prevent black influence in center. Unfortunately, black ended up with huge left side, so again that d6 move comes to haunt me...

\\m/ : see comment on k8 move. Playing the right shape at the right time is the better way to not create burden that will come to haunt you later in the game.]

;W[kn]C[Making sure I stay connected];B[jm]
(;W[hn];B[in];W[io];B[hm];W[gn];B[gm];W[en];B[em];W[ki]C[I jum to limit size of black center. I'm sure there were better moves... but where... ^^;]
;B[fn];W[fo];B[fm];W[il]C[Black had created cutting points to expoit, but I felt confident that it would all stay connected, so I decided to threaten to cut.

\\m/ : better to turn at e13. If you assume that b is connected, these 2 stones are meaningless]
;B[lk]C[... which he ignored ^^;];W[ml];B[mk];W[jj];B[ni]C[This was premature for black imo, I was hoping to gain points, but he just gave up that stone and I might have read the cut wrong...

\\m/ : b is helping w in the sequence here];W[im];B[jn]
(;W[nj]C[Now that I am looking at this again, maybe I should simply have cut at n9. It seems to work and capture black, but I might be reading this wrong...

\\m/ : let's try];B[nk];W[nh]C[\\m/ : have you said thanks to your opponent ?]
;B[om];W[ho]C[I make sure I stay connected.

\\m/ : should o5 before];B[hj]C[I think this was big for black. My next move is e13 to reduce and strenthen myself. Was there something better?]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[jf]C[Maybe should have played h11 here instead?

\\m/ : locally, should be at j13];B[ad]C[I was stupid not so see that. I should have playing a15 much earlier. This is a fairly big reduction imo, considering a15 would most likely have been sente.]
;W[ac];B[ae];W[bc];B[jb];W[ib];B[jg];W[kh];B[fg]C[He's trying to use aji at d15, but I felt that I couldn't let him considering black is looking quite big at the moment. I think this fight and everything that happened on the left is what made me lose the game.]
;W[ff];B[gg];W[gf];B[hf]C[\\m/ : b is overplaying here, game losing move (yes, b lost)]

\\m/ : that's why I wasn't understanding the result, in fact, w won by 1,5 pt here, h4 is a dead stone so 3 pts more XD
When score is that close, chould check the board more than once]
