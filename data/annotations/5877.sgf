C[i edited my go file with Panda-gGo.  Happy Reviewing!

I am white, ZetharX.

Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'm reviewing your game.  I've preceded all my comments with my name.

I think your big problem is not that you played on when you had stones that were clearly going to be captured.  You had bigger problems in that you consistently did little more than follow your opponent around the board, simply responding to his moves.  The early endgame sequences around M19 and K2 are examples of this.

Your other big problem, I think, is not recognizing potential cutting points and the danger they pose -- both places where you could cut your opponent, and places where you could have been cut.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jq];W[jc]C[Ted: I think I'd play something a little more aggressive here, by approaching at O17, instead of imitating what Black's doing.  Black still has the initiative of going first, and White wants to try to take that away, and not simply follow Black around.]
;B[dj]
(;W[ck]C[Ted: I'm not so sure I like this move.  I think I'd prefer a more natural extension from the D4 stone, playing around C7.]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[dh];W[cj];B[ci];W[bi];B[bh];W[bj]C[i am trying to keep as much territory as possible for the bottom left]
;B[df];W[cf]C[i see an attack on top left, so i begin my claim on the corner]
;B[cg];W[bf];B[ai];W[aj];B[ah];W[bg]C[Ted: I think this is a mistake: Black should have taken advantage of the cut at C8.  See the variation.  (White, as it turns out, can save the stones, but it would have been much easier for White to go wrong than Black.)]

(;B[di];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[ff];W[de];B[el];W[dm];B[em];W[dn]
;B[ge]C[Ted: Since you were worried about Black getting too much territory in the center, look at the wall Black has right now.

I don't think Black should be able to convert it all to territory, however.]
;W[gd]C[Ted: I think I'd play on the right side, or, barring that, jump out to the center from the K17 stone.]
;B[he];W[hd];B[id];W[ic];B[ie];W[je];B[jd];W[ke];B[ld];W[kd]
;B[lc];W[kc]C[i did not see this line on L as an opportunity until later...lucky it worked out, but i had no focus on all the territory he was surrounding with his stones toward the center]
;B[lf];W[le];B[me]
(;W[hc]C[Ted: An unnecessary connecting move.  You should have either jumped out towards the center, by playing something like K13, or played on the right side -- something like R10.  See the variation.]
;B[jf];W[lb];B[mb];W[kb];B[mc];W[ma];B[na];W[la];B[nc];W[en]
;B[fn];W[fo];B[go];W[gn];B[fm];W[gp];B[ho];W[ep];B[hn];W[gm]
C[Ted: You can't save these stones, so it's better just to leave them and play somewhere else.  Perhaps you might be able to use the aji of having a stone there later on for some purpose.]
;B[gl];W[ek];B[hm];W[fk]C[Ted: How did you plan to save these stones?

Here is a place where you should really have played over on the right side.]
;B[gj]C[Ted: Black's going to capture the two stones with a net.  Don't waste time trying to save them.

I'd play around R10 next.  You should have no problem getting a stable group, and it will reduce Black quite a bit.

There's also L14; see the variation.]
(;W[gk];B[hk];W[fj];B[fi];W[hp];B[hi]C[Ted: Black lets you get away by playing an unneccssary move.]
;W[ip]C[Ted: This was a big move.];B[jo]C[after two fatal attempts to get his ground, i felt bad off]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[iq];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr];W[ir];B[js];W[is]C[Ted: You didn't need to respond to Black yet.  This was worth only one point.  R10 is much bigger.

Here, and at the top (the whole sequence around M19) you played a series of small moves when there were much bigger open areas on the board.  You may get a few points of territory locally, but you're strengthening Black's wall each time you do this.]
;B[ks];W[pk]C[seeing that all is finished on the left, i move to attack, a bit farther from all the stones in the top right, one down from center

Ted: Finally.];B[pl];W[ql];B[pm];W[pj];B[qm];W[oi];B[ok];W[rl]
;B[rm];W[oh];B[ni];W[og]LB[og:3][oh:2][oi:1]C[Ted: Rather than playing these stones in order, you probably should have jumped from 1 to 3, and only played 2 when necessary.

Note, also, that Black has a dangerous move at S9.  See the variation.]

(;B[of];W[pf];B[pe];W[qe];B[qf];W[pg];B[re]C[Ted: Black should have played S14 here instead, preventing White's next forcing move.]
;W[rf];B[qd];W[rg];B[qg];W[rh]C[Ted: Better would have been the atari at R12.]
;B[qh];W[qi];B[ph];W[qq];B[rj];W[qk];B[qp]C[Ted: Black should have blocked the other way, driving you towards the closer wall.  Not that it mattered, since you let him capture your stones.

See the variations on a way to make life here.]
(;W[nf];B[oe];W[mf];B[ng]C[i got my space claimed and tried connecting, seeing that as my only hope, and it failed

Ted: Then sacrifice some stones.  You don't have to save every stone, if letting them die can serve a purpose that gets you more points.

In this case, that means playing the atari at O12 instead.]

(;W[mg];B[nh]
(;W[oj]TR[ng][nh][ni]C[Ted: Better is O10, threatening to capture the marked stones with N11 next.  See the variation.]
;B[nk]C[now this is the turning point...the point when i realized i could break through]
;W[kf]C[force the cover, if he wanted to keep those stones dead]
;B[lg];W[if]TR[id][jd][ge][he][ie]MA[jf]C[now he needs to choose.

X or triangle.

he probably didnt see the threat on triangle cause i would have chosen to lose the X....maybe i need guidance on why i would be wrong?]
;B[jg];W[gf]C[impending doom];B[mh];W[ri];B[hg];W[hf];B[gg]
;W[ig];B[ih];W[kg]C[double atari finds me with more stones]
;B[lh];W[jh];B[kh]C[Ted: Black should obviously have played K11 here.]
;W[ii];B[hh];W[ji]C[Ted: L11 is better here, as it threatens O10 next.]
;B[fl];W[ij];B[hj];W[ik];B[il];W[jl];B[km];W[im];B[hl];W[jm]
;B[io];W[kl];B[ll];W[lm];B[kn];W[lk];B[ml];W[lo];B[ln];W[ko]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[lp];W[mm];B[nm]C[again, he killed two groups of my stones...good? bad?

i know that every time he kills my stones, he is taking his own territory to do it, so it evens out (roughly), but i still feel its points i shouldnt give him.

Ted: You don't have to worry about saving every single stone you play.  Sacrificing a stone to allow you to (for example) connect someplace else and reduce a large amount of your opponent's territory is a perfectly good use of a stone.]
;W[mk];B[nn];W[nj];B[mj]C[at this point im begging for eyes....one is obvious and one i need to work for.

Ted: If you're thinking about the group on the right, T14 is simple enough.]

(;W[kk];B[lj];W[kj];B[ki];W[mi]C[luckily, i could use the set he hadnt taken yet to gain my next eye]
;B[ne];W[li];B[jn];W[qj]C[Ted: Not necessary.];B[sl];W[sk];B[sm]
;W[se];B[sd];W[sf];B[ag];W[af];B[ch];W[ce];B[rq];W[pq];B[oq]
C[this fatal attempt almost cost me this close game

maybe there was a way to get 2 eyes here....i doubted it, so i gave up.

Ted: You should have tried for two eyes much earlier, when Black ignored your 3-3 invasion.]
;W[cl];B[pr];W[er]C[was this a good safty?  nessisary?  i dont know if i am just wasting my territory point here?

i know there was plenty of room for improvement...please help me on knowing when my attack is going to fail so i dont have to waste time on them.  also, i dont have a really good eye for seeing shapes that are forming in the future...i didnt see how i was giving him the center untill he nearly closed the corners.  a dan would (in his position) have closed the gap i got out of and also played away from invasion as to contain it.  im just lucky he was not open enough to see what would have secured his win.  thank you for reviewing.  i look forward to your feedback.

if there was anything i missed, and didnt comment on myself, please point it out to me....im only a 20 kyu.]
