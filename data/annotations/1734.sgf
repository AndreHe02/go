C[Dear reviewer,
I lost this one pretty quickly, but I really don't know what I did wrong.

Dear reviewee,
I'm adum, 3k*. I'll try to help you with your weak points.
overall, i would say that tactical problems led to your downfall in this game. i wouldn't worry about your fuseki, but concentrate on improving your tactical play. twice you played completely wasted moves, once dying in gote and once connecting for 3 points in gote. sometimes it can be hard psychologically to lose a group, and you desperately want to try anything to save it. but throwing good moves after bad is never wise, especially if you're still in the game, as you were. two wasted moves is thirty points right there.
another thing i would look at is corner invasions. you messed up the bottom-left invasion, and you apparently thought the bottom-right was impregnable, when it wasn't.
look for aji and wait to exploit it when the timing is best.]

(;W[cn]C[Q: I assume this is the correct side?

yes];B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[dj]C[Q: I was planning to take the left side here. Should I have played a line lower? Or perhaps around K16?

this is the correct area. K16 is big, but this extension is urgent, or else black will immediately attack your stones and they'll become heavy. C10 is also possible -- more territory oriented, whereas D10 is better for moyos. C10 also works better with D15, as it's a combination of low and high. in the end, though, it'll make very little difference.]
;B[qf]
(;W[nc]C[Q: I played low since I figured that if black invaded, I'd be in trouble. See variation.

no trouble. but this answer is okay too. slightly inferior for building a moyo though.]
;B[pj];W[jj]C[Q: Black is having an imposing moyo, and I wanted to prevent him from getting the center.

this is fine.];B[ci]C[Q:  surprising invasion.

yeah. looks questionable.]
(;W[cj]TR[cj][dj][cn][dn]C[this is probably the wrong direction. white is looking overconcentrated with the marked stones.]

(;B[bi]C[this is bad. too slow]
(;W[bj]C[a little slow. lets black run the other way easily.

when trying to pick a move here, think about your goals. what are you trying to do? make territory between your two walls, or attack the black stones? the answer is attacking the black stones. these two walls are way overconcentrated. they're only making about 12 points between five stones.]
;B[be]C[now black gets a good extension

at this stage, black is going to live small on the side. that's the best you can hope for. so try to make him small while getting strong on the outside]

(;W[cg]C[this is probably not the best shape for white.];B[cf]
;W[dg]
(;B[cc]C[this move is questionable shape]
(;W[cd]C[Q: I don't know if this was the right side. Perhaps C18 would've been better?

no, this is definitely correct];B[bc]
(;W[bg]TR[bi][ci]C[Q: Cutting the marked stones off...

good, although better to try and cut at B16 first. maybe black will give you those stones too.]
;B[db];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[hc]C[this is a pretty poor move. it helps white. continuing to push is probably better. playing elsewhere is okay too, as white can't block in sente (but could if had already played B16)]
;W[fb]
(;B[bd]C[it's a shame white didn't get this sente move earlier. however, i don't think this move is necessary for black.]

(;W[qd]LB[kc:A][ge:B]C[Q: I was unsure between this and a and b. In retrospect, they would've probably been better choices.

A seems reasonable. B is playing too close to strength. I think your move in the corner is okay though. certainly not a key mistake.]
;B[of]C[good shape for black. black's moyo is looking better than white's. but the game is still reasonably close]
;W[mf];B[kc]C[first, attack the two black stones at top]
(;W[ph]TR[of][qf]C[this is a strange move. i don't think you can hope to attack the marked stones. they're too close to Q10.]
;B[pg];W[oh]
(;B[qh]C[this sequence has helped black get stronger]
(;W[nj]C[this sequence is only valuable if you can kill those two black stones inside your moyo. that's pretty tough to do, especially since you end in gote. otherwise, you built up a wall that has little effect on black's strong, low stones]
;B[mb]C[sad that black gets this key move];W[nb];B[if];W[hd]
LB[hb:A]C[Q: I was aiming for a cut at A to eat away eye space.

this move doesn't really help, i think. remember, touching your opponent generally makes him stronger.]
;B[id];W[he];B[ie];W[hb];B[ib];W[gc];B[le];W[me];B[mc];W[ka]
TR[le]C[Q: I thought this was pretty nifty. But now I realize that it was pointless, as the marked stone makes the second eye.

this group is indeed looking hard to kill.];B[ha];W[ic];B[jc]

(;W[jb]C[Q: I think connecting would've been better. Then I could've played N19 later on... See variation.

yes: that's the point of L19 - to have the freedom to connect either side. however, in this case you're not going to be able to kill anyway]
;B[ia];W[ga]C[Q: Final attempt...];B[hc];W[cq];B[gb];W[fa]LB[bp:A]
[dq:B]C[Q: This was a mistake, I should've really played on A or B or something.

yes. connecting is pointless. playing at B is huge];B[na];W[oa]
;B[ma];W[pb];B[bo]
(;W[dq]C[this is the wrong move to live after B5, due to F4. see var.]
;B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[ds]
(;B[ar]C[Q: Monkey jump... This kills the corner. I think I was supposed to be able to keep the corner alive, but I didn't see this coming.

yeah, after D3 there's really no hope for white. black can kill other ways too]
;W[hb];B[ic]C[small. black should play elsewhere];W[hp];B[iq]
C[Q: And it's all just struggling from now on.

perhaps, but your position still has fighting left in it. black doesn't have much real territory. for example, the bottom-right corner is not territory yet.]

;W[eo];B[fo];W[en];B[ep];W[fn];B[br]C[Q: No more liberties...

well, you're lucky to get black to respond to all those moves in the first place. white is still in the game, depending upon how you handle R11]
;W[bs]C[you should save sente plays like this. if you know it won't amount to anything, save it for ko threats later. the external threats you made were fine, because they helped your position. but this just costs you a ko threat without gaining anything.]
;B[cr];W[dr]C[this is gote. too big to die in gote.];B[hf]C[this move looks like it's gote too. best to ignore it if you're behind on the board. make black prove it's sente.]

(;W[gf];B[gg]C[another move you can possibly ignore];W[ff];B[hi]
C[Q: Had to resign - by my count black is about 50 points ahead at this stage already. I made a couple of stupid mistakes, but I thought my fuseki was quite okay. After that, I have no idea why I lost this badly...
Thanks for using your time!

it's too early to resign! you're counting things as black territory which are not yet territory. the bottom-right is harder to invade now that black got N4, but not impossible. but of course, R11 is the big move. if you catch those stones, the game is close to even.]
