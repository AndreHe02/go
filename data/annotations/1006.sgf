C[Dear reviewer!

My question is at move 64.

Thanks, Berni

===
My comments are after '==='  line.
Before move 64 I try to point out things that seem good or bad to me. Those are more often bad, but that is not because you're weaker and make more mistakes but because I can see those better. Your good moves might be easily same moves that 9p would make in same situation, but it's hard for me to know what is the reason behind his thoughts.

At first I have to say that I can't believe I have been so good player as you are when I was about 15k.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dp];W[cc];B[ce];W[ed]C[===
I rarely play 3-3 point so I don't know any josekis (moreover the thinking or reasoning behind those josekis).

My Essential Joseki book didn't have any joseki for 5-3 approach in the 3-3-positioned corner. So I can't say anything what could be good here. In any case I can't see anything bad on W response here.]
;B[ee];W[fd];B[jc]C[Good point! Makes framework while preparing to reduce W at top left.]
;W[oq];B[op]C[Definitely bad point. Becomes clear];W[np]C[Right way to punish!]
;B[pp];W[pq];B[pn]C[What B has achieved? Tight position while givin at least 10 points to W.]
;W[qf]C[Good judgement.];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qj]C[Good point!

Are you sure Q10 wouldn't be even better?];B[qk]C[Bad. If B want to settle down R5 is way to go.]

(;W[pj]C[Solid, but misses way to punish.];B[pk];W[fq]C[Good point for white.]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[cn];W[jp]C[W gets perfect point. Bottom isn't yet territory, but very close to turn to that.]
;B[hq]C[What is B attacking?]
(;W[ho];B[fr];W[gr];B[es];W[gq];B[jq]C[B grows his mistake!]
;W[kq]C[Good grab.];B[cj]TR[dj]C[Good point but definetely triangle (D10) would have been better! It would have balanced whole left side.

Anyway, this was stone B has needed long time to give C15 some reason at all.]
;W[qo]C[W has good idea of taking area and inducing battle.]
;B[po]TR[qn]C[Awfully bad move. What is worth to save of two nearly captured stones (about two points). This might even make right side worse than it was before. If B wants to save his stones triangle (R6) is the (only) way to go.   Just to see the difference, compare to variation where B plays D10 or K15.]
;W[hc]C[W claims to be able to win. This is good point anyway, makes up very good continuation at M17.]
;B[hd]C[Nothing to attack.];W[gd]
(;B[he]C[This move doesn't do much. C];W[nj]C[Good patient way to attack. B should get quite nervous now.]
;B[nk]
(;W[mj];B[mh]C[I can't see what B could possibly attack (even if his group bottom wasn't dying).]
;W[nf]C[It is enough to get into center (and maybe attack at the same time) N9 would be really good.]
;B[mf];W[me]
(;B[mg]C[B has to cut O15, now he's making many targets to attack, many weak groups.]
;W[ne];B[jg];W[md];B[od]C[O17 better.];W[mk]C[W did not miss the point second time.]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[jk]C[B have to be really confident he's saving bottom right.

Of course it's plausible to reject the whole group - B being sure he get everything left :).

But then playing O8 wasn't wise at all. Much better to play K9 at once. In any case K9 is good point, but maybe unsuitable for B's uncomfortable position.]

(;W[nn];B[nm];W[mm]C[Now W did get free wall by attacking. If only he would have something on left. Can't get everything...]

------------
   79 Points

black:
b) 18 Points
c)  4 Points
e) 87 Points
g) 10 Points
------------
  119 Points

At this time of the game, I thought, I will loose, because black leads with about 40 Points and it should be easy to defend this advantage. I won, because after that black played very week.

But my question: Up to this time where could I've played stronger? Where were my mistakes?

===

Your view is justificated but with a little bit wrong reasoning. Counting is erroneous. From my point of view situation is quite equal. It's all about how much W can destroy B area.

To make few ideas for your recalculation, please consider variations I present.]

(;W[kj]TR[hk]C[Stone at triangle (H9) would have worked better. This way W just gives B the wall he needs to get some real territory instead of imaginary one.

I end up my real game commenting here. I just make few fast notes still.

  - Aleksi];B[jj];W[ji];B[hj];W[kh];B[kg];W[lg]C[Bad move. Doesn't do anything. Except strenghtens black and loses aji.]
;B[lf];W[lh];B[ke];W[qc]C[Good idea! Very good. Now W uses his surrounding strenght. I just wouldn't be so hasty. First N18. Threats both the corner and one variation from move 64.]
;B[re];W[pc];B[rc];W[nc]C[This move shows, that White didn't want to live at corner, so going outside in would have been better.]
;B[oc];W[nb];B[ob];W[im]C[Corner isn't so big after all.

But this move K7 misses point. You considered area E as big, but still you want to make few points instead of taking E away. Try F10, C8, E10, G12. I mean try on board. See what are all the ways you can come up with to

1) connect your potential-territory-destroying stone to your own
2) put B to eat that stone and as a side effect you managed to crush into his area.]
