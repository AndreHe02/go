C[Otakung: This game I played Black and I won by resign but I think there are many things wrong in this game.

Christian:
The middle game reminded me of something a mountain guide said to me some
weeks ago: One shouldn't give the mountains too many chances. Although you
didn't loose the lead in the game, you gave your opponent a chance to come
back into the game after you had already won the game in the early middle
game. Among us amateurs, an important point in becoming stronger is to make
less mistakes and to give the opponent less chances.

Best wishes

C[The easiest way to play here is to invade the corner at sansan. This joseki is usually played when there is already a white sanren-sei on the left and aims at building thickness to form a large moyo.]

;W[cj];B[fc];W[hc];B[cc]C[Otakung:Is that good?  or jump to the center is better?
This is the normal way of playing. However, it is important to reduce the white moyo after the joseki.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[ge];B[ej]C[Very good!];W[gj];B[ck]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[ci];B[el]C[Good. It is very important to play lightly because white is strong in this area.]
;W[ek]C[This is bad. White should just play at D8. By filling one of his own liberties he gives black an unbearable squeeze.]
;B[fk];W[dl];B[dm];W[cl];B[cm];W[bl];B[bm]C[Black should connect at F7.]
;W[em]C[This is the wrong cut. Cutting at F8 makes it harder for black to get good shape.]
;B[fl];W[bk];B[fn];W[fm]C[Very bad because white is captured now. White should just play at E6.]
;B[gm];W[en];B[eo];W[dn];B[do];W[fj]C[Now the game is nearly over. The cut at N5 is very big now. White's opening stategy has failed completely.]
;B[cp]C[Very big, but I would prefer the cut at N5.];W[mp];B[nc]
C[Very good.];W[qd];B[qe];W[qc]C[This move is dangerous. Usually white hanes at S15 (See 'Enclosure Joseki' (Uchikomi to Sono Kobo) by Takemiya Masaki).]
;B[re]C[Otakung: I think I can kill although it can cut.
I do not think you can kill white.]
