CJT - hi I'm reviewing your game - my comments will be marked CJT

Generally I've not gone into too much detail with variations - mostly where you made an obvious mistake you have spotted it in your comments.

Your main weakness is wasting moves in one way or another:
- Making unnecessary threats - you did this four or five times at least, where you're just giving your opponent two turns in a row in effect. I suggest studying a few life-and-death problems if you have time, just to help with recognising lost cause situations (and of course the tesuji that can help you kill a group!)
- Merely responding to an opponents attack, rather than thinking about how to counter-attack. If you're defending, you should think about which direction to defend from.

A key point in this game was where W approached the fourth corner with move 159.  This should have been the point where you attack his approach and start making some real territory.  However, from there you only make the same territory as W (and he made his in the center, which is harder)...

To improve this, first try to think about this game specifically, and maybe play through a few variations, but most of all when an opponent attacks inside your sphere of influence, try to make territory while attacking the invasion - simply trying to kill it, or reacting defensively will do you no good.

I hope you find my review helpful - enjoy! :o)];W[dd];B[dh]
LB[dj:a][cf:b][df:c]C[(( I confess I don't know opening moves as well as I should, upon viewing some other games I think I should have attempted c14 or d14.))

CJT - yes this is not standard - it leaves too much room for white to invade, or even attack the stone (see variation on next move)

A, B or C are more standard]
(;W[id]
(;B[ef]C[CJT - the stone at D12 still has no base - I would have played this move at C14 (see variation for a possible continuation) but this move helps W to strengthen the upper side without making the left any more solid for black.]

(;W[cd];B[bg];W[bd];B[af];W[ad]
(;B[ae]C[CJT - Quite unnecessary - if W plays A15, you lose 1 point. In the opening 1 point is nothing. Locally F14 is huge - it mitigates the bad shape of your empty triangle and provides you with massive influence on the left and in the center.]
;W[oc]C[CJT - This is not a great move from W - he comes too close to your corner stone. You should punish him with solid defense.]

;W[ld];B[oe]C[(( Perhaps I should have addressed m16 as a risk, but the cutting point was making me nervous. ))

CJT - The cutting point is no threat. W P15 is met by B P14.  Better moves are K4 or Q10 to build a moyo, or M15 or F14 to strengthen your walls.]
;W[qg]C[CJT - This is a preposterous invasion - you should look at this with glee since it gives you the prefect opportunity to make territory while attacking.]

[im][jm][jl][jk][jn][gm][hl]C[CJT - As mentioned in my comment at the start of the game - I think this is a key position to learn from.

You have given away quite a lot of territory at the top, but have thickness above and to the right and W still has an eyeless group in the center.

From here you go on to lose almost all the territory still available.  For reference I have marked the territory that B and W end up with from this position - I hope you find it revealing :o)

(In fact W makes 1 more point of territory in this area: 30-29...)]

CJT - :o( sorry but you are a long way behind here - W has 50 points on the upper side, and so fr you have no big territories. Also from here there is no fertile ground for either player - most of the open space will go to waste since both players can fight for it.]
