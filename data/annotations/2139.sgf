;B[pp];W[pd];B[dp];W[cd];B[pj]C[B5 : Not really bad but I think a kakari at E16 or a san ren sei at K4 is bigger.]
;W[id];B[cj]C[B7 : Idem than 5];W[jp]C[W8 : After this move, white is already better than Black.]
;B[gq];W[nq];B[oq]C[RGW: Is this a reasonable defense or does it make it too easy for white?
B11 : The exchange for white 12 at P4 is not considered good for Black. You strengthen White too much and don't cover completely an invasion of your corner. Generally, 11 is not a defensive move but an attacking move when 8 is not yet here and you dont want him to play kikashi when you pincer.]
;W[np];B[pn];W[ho]LB[qg:a][go:b]C[W14 : Look strange. 14 is at the right place when 9 is at H4 and it would be possible to play at F5 locally. But it is not so big now as White doesn't need to erase a moyo and get some strength in the center. Why not playing at "a" for example. But it is true that Black "b" would also be a big move.]
;B[fp]C[RGW: I do need a defensive move in here, don't I?  Was this a good one?
JH : Not too bad but F5 looks better];W[cn]C[W16 : No need to invade in black influence zone to get a weak group.]
;B[co]LB[cq:a]C[B17 : The idea is good but playing at C4 would be better. The sansan "a" is still a possibility for white after 17.]
;W[dn];B[cg]LB[fn:a][gn:b]C[RGW: Should black be more aggressive here?
JH : Yes,  "a" would be usual but 19 is not that bad as you can still cut white if he plays at "a" or "b".]
;W[fn];B[nn]C[RGW: I didn't want white building up a wall here, but this doesn't seem correct.
Not bad but playing at E16 is slightly better.];W[oo];B[on]
C[B23 : Better to connect the other way];W[po];B[qo];W[qq];B[qp]
;W[pq]LB[or:a]C[W28 : A big mistake as Black may punish white by playing sagari at "a". White should play at "a" !!]
;B[op]LB[or:a]C[B29 : Not the best: "a" is better];W[or];B[rq]
LB[qf:a]C[N31 : Too early : you can go somewhere else like "a" but it is still a good move as it is big.]
;W[rr];B[no];W[lp]C[The sequence is a succes for Black anyway.]
;B[ir]LB[jr:a]C[RGW: Too slow?
JH : It is not urgent to play in this zone. Locally you can go one step further with "a"]
;W[jr];B[iq]C[This move is clearly too small];W[jq]C[This move is too small too.]
;B[qf];W[nd];B[rd]C[RGW: Would P14 be better?  Or something else?
JH : Yes you can go on the other side at E16];W[qh]C[This looks dangerous.]
;B[qi]LB[of:a]C[Black is helping white to get strong. Just jumping is simple and good. If you play many one point jumps like "a", you will be stronger by at least one stone.]
;W[ph];B[of];W[nh];B[og]C[I don't think it is necessary to strengten White even if you fear the cut of your tobi, this cut is not good for white]
;W[oh];B[mf];W[lh];B[qc]C[RGW: Should black have continued pushing out at L14 instead?
It is possible, but your move is OK];W[pc];B[qb]LB[ld:a]C[Not so good as you don't cover your weakness. What do you do if White cut your knight move as in the variation ?
Anyway, Black should play at "a"]
(;W[le];B[lf];W[nk];B[pl]C[RGW: Too passive?
JH : Yes. You should perhaps try L15];W[mm];B[lo];W[ko]C[This move is not good as it helps Black to make a bamboo joint towards White territory.]
;B[ln];W[qk];B[ql]LB[pk:a]C[This move seems weak : connecting at "a" is usual]

(;W[ri]LB[pk:a]C[I have the feeling that white should push through at "a"]
;B[rk];W[qj];B[rj];W[pi];B[pk]C[White has accomplished almost nothing here]
;W[jh];B[ke]C[Good move];W[ld];B[kd];W[kc];B[lc];W[mc];B[jc]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[lb];B[jd]C[This is good for Black];W[hc]TR[id]
C[It is not so good to try to save the white stone delta. F17 would be better, I think. But Black has to cover the cut...]
;B[kg];W[kh];B[em];W[en];B[fc]C[Good];W[fd]LB[hf:a]C[This white move is not good. Jumping at "a" would be better.]
;B[ed];W[gd];B[ee];W[ec];B[dc];W[eb];B[db]LB[cc:a]C[Possible at "a" also to take sente]
;W[fb];B[dd]C[RGW: This seemed like an ok outcome for black.  Could black have done better here?
JH : Black did very well in this corner.];W[jf];B[jg];W[ig]
;B[if];W[ie];B[hf];W[je];B[kf];W[hg];B[gf];W[gg];B[ff];W[ib]
;B[ia];W[ha];B[ja]LB[da:a]C[RGW: Now that these two white groups are separated, they look vulnerable, but I couldn't figure out a successful way to attack either one.  Did I miss an opportunity here?
JH : Now white is alive but "a" seems to be sente for Black.]
;W[ch];B[dg]C[This move is a little too conservative. D12 is normal but your way is safer.]
;W[dh];B[eh]C[RGW: Should I have made an effort to save the two stones at C10 & E7?  I thought I could let white have a small territory on the left side to prevent white from getting a large middle territory.]
;W[di];B[ei]C[Usually it is better not to oblige to occupy a point where he wants to go, which is D10. So, it is better to play on F10 or F11 in this case.]
;W[dj];B[ej];W[dk];B[ek];W[dl];B[bn];W[bm];B[bo];W[gk]C[This move is not so big even if it looks as a good move. I think B13 is bigger]
;B[kn]C[Here you had a chance to play B12.];W[kl]
(;B[gj]C[RGW: I was running low on time here and began making ineffective moves to reduce the center.  Would I have been better off just solidifying and expanding my own territory?
JH : Yes. A move at B12 is bigger. See variation.  G10 is almost sente but for white playing B13 is also very big.]
;W[hj];B[hk];W[gl];B[hl];W[hm];B[in];W[im];B[jm];W[jl];B[hi]
;W[ij]C[RGW: I ran out of time here.  I felt like the game was close.
JH : It is close but if you play K1, G11 and B12 in sente you are not bad.]
