;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec];B[de]C[Usual replies here would be c16/c17. This gives him an easy big corner.]
;W[dd];B[dh];W[fq];B[hq];W[nq];B[kq];W[lp];B[kp]C[This shape is a bit constricted (korigatachi)]
;W[qo];B[oq];W[po];B[qp];W[np];B[pj];W[pl];B[qk];W[ql];B[nr]
;W[mr];B[pr];W[qq];B[rp];W[qr];B[rr]C[essential for the life of the corner]
;W[rq];B[sq];W[op];B[pq]C[not needed- if he plays here, he's in atari]
;W[ns];B[or];W[os];B[ps]C[not needed, r1 better if you're playing here, but there are very large ppoints elsewhere, e.g. k17.  Try to avoid replying automatically! :-)]
;W[ms];B[kr]C[m3 is better in this area, for preventing eye shape, but this move is very small and does not attack.]
;W[mq]C[m3 better shape for white];B[dn];W[fo];B[dk];W[dm];B[cm]

;W[hf];B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[do];W[ep]C[For me this (left-down corner) structure was strong enough... but later white attacked it and got it. What is the mistake?

I agree that this should be strong enough, but there are too many cutting points in this shape, and it leaves you vulnerable to threat moves in a ko fight..]
;B[jf]C[This is very big, but defending the right upper corner is larger!]
;W[hn];B[in];W[hm];B[im];W[kn];B[jo]C[Not needed- this group has plenty of space and is out into the centre already.]
;W[go];B[gp];W[gq];B[hp];W[is];B[ir];W[hs];B[hr];W[gr];B[js]
;W[gs];B[fp]C[small but sente- save this type of move for ko threats!]
;W[eo];B[ik];W[en];B[co]C[mistake- defend at b5];W[hk];B[ii]
C[this doesn't do any work- the groups below are all alive]
;W[ih];B[hl]C[what do you hope to gain by this?];W[gl];B[il]
;W[gk];B[hj];W[gj];B[gi];W[gh];B[fi];W[fh]C[the last few moves are all filling dead space while there are some very big points yet to be played.]
;B[fj];W[gm];B[jh]C[better];W[hh];B[hi]C[unnecessary connection. e13 better]

;W[nc]C[At this point I felt I had a strong hold of the right-up corner. I knew I should keep white from making eyes, but I made mistakes and lost it. How is the best way to defend it?

p17, q17/18, anything that forces him up towards your wall! :-)]
;B[md];W[nd];B[oc];W[ne];B[oe]C[too many cutting points!  p18 much better.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[the infamous "empty triangle" forced by your pevious bad shape.]

You were winning for much of this game.  The best thing to take from this is to try to avoid answering moves without looking for something bigger!

Keep enjoying your games!    Best wishes,
