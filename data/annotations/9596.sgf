C[Hello! I'm Elom Willson, some random player still stuck at 3 kyu despite having been playing Go for exactly 3 years. WindnWater on IGS. My notes start with WnW.

WnW:

In this game, I quickly fell behind in the opening, as usual, so had to try to fight my way back into the game, typical for me. This time, it didn't work out, I could not complicate the game or lead it towards my preffered fighting game.

I wonder why my opening play is so far behind my (unstable!) reading level.

Some notes are put in to show my thoughts during the game.

Also, I completely forgot that the game was reverse komi throughout the whole game.

Thanks!

Hello, my name is John, and I am a 1d-3d on KGS (Depending on sleep level and time settings). I will look at your opening carefully, and then I will look at opportunities later in the game for chances at turning the game around.]

(;W[ed]C[Alright!
What is going on here. When I play moves, review games, or replay professional games, I try to create a narrative of what is going on. 
A) The top right is looking for a balances position and a shimari on the top side.
B) White played the diagonal corner to avoid cross corner openings, and the 3-4 is just like yours.
C) Your approach is not bad, but what is the reason:
   1) to prevent a shimari in that corner.
   2) to discupt white's known openings
   3) just because
D)White pincers with the two space high pincer. Because it is farther away, it is less concerned with attacking your stone, and more concerned with getting some bottom position. I am sure you know some common responses, and had a reason to tenuki again, but I am not sure.
E) the top left 5-3 puts a heavy emphasis on the left side.
F) White's approach is loose territorially, but avoids a number of complex pincers the 3rd line has to deal with.]
;B[dc]C[WnW: Is this an acceptable response?
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is joseki, and it leaves Black with a locally favorable result, since the corner is huge.]

(;W[dd]C[This is Crude play for White, helping your defend your weakness.]

(;B[cc];W[id];B[oc];W[pq]
(;B[po]C[Opening is going very well for you, but the main isssue is how to deal with the pincer in the bottom left. You could consider trying to obtain sente in the bottom left first.]

;W[oq];B[qo];W[qr];B[rp];W[rr]C[WnW: I feel that the outcome is brilliant for white. White's pincer stone stiffles black's thickness.]

(;B[jq]C[WnW: I believed that I was behind so attempted to start to a commotion, of course this isn't really an attack however.]
;W[hn]
(;B[qj]C[WnW: Hmm,   I was wondering weather to play a one space pincer instead...

~~~~~~~~~~~~
Further pincer is fine, since you will need to take moves to pretect your r5 group.]

[qr:E][rr:E]TR[mn]C[WnW: Now I think it looks as if black can't fight properly. My play on the lower side seems very unreasonable now.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The bottom is quite messy, but you expected this when you played tenuki after the pincer C, and again when you played the invasion D. A is still quite along, so you can lean against it to attack, or attach to it to make a base. C should have problem connecting to the circle group, but D likewise should not have trouble connecting to the triangle group. E is super-solid, you do not have many fprcing moves there, though o4 is an option.]

(;B[jn];W[eo];B[cq];W[bp]
(;B[jm]C[WnW: It looked like the only feasible move given the current situation XD I hadn't noticed any major mistakes by white yet.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
What are we worried about, him cutting one of our stones off?]
;W[oe]C[WnW: This move hit me hard. A more accurate way of saying it might be...

"... This peek completely ruined my strategy!... "

It was ambitous  enough  to hope to chase white's group to make some kind of profit and *hopefully*  catch up,  ut now I have to deal with this stone.]

To live?

If you want to disrupt his middle, expand high on the sides.]

Any move inside this line is an invasion an can be attacked, A and B  are weak spots, but need a plan.
Playing on the line is a reduction.]

Thank you for taking the time to go through my game. I hope to become stronger in the future.
~~~~~~~~~
The main issue seems to be playing tenuki in sort of strange places. This appears once in the opening, and it causes problems for the remainder of the game.

The other issue is I am not sure what you are thinking about during the game, or how you are evaluating the positions. You decisions like "I am behind", or "I wanted sente", but I do not get a sense that you have a clear goal. When you play a move, it should be based on 1) group strength, 2) positional analysis.]
