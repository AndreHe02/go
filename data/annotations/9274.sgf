AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[[krinid\] Hi, I'm Zac aka krinid on KGS and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'll prefix all my comments with "[krinid\]"  I've added a lot of variations and comments, so please review through all nodes in all variations to see the possible plays.]
;W[nq]C[TonyLB [5k\]: Hi!  Let's have a good game.];B[qn];W[jp]
C[randalleg [10k\]: ty gg];B[pr];W[fq];B[cn];W[qi];B[jc];W[df]
;B[fd];W[di];B[ck]C[Up to here I feel good about what I have

[krinid\] I agree - everything so far looks great.  You're playing a solid, non-aggressive game which is good when playing black in a handi game.  You know your opponent is stronger, so keeping it simple and making moves you know are big means it's tougher for white to close the gap the handi stones provide.]
;W[cj];B[bk]C[should I go up? to work with k10 stone?

[krinid\] You should go up!  Definitely play D9 here.  You don't want to play on the 2nd line on move 14.  Way too small.  Even without K10, D9 is the best move here.]
;W[cd];B[cc];W[ce];B[dc];W[dk];B[bj];W[bi];B[dl];W[ek];B[el]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[cr]
(;B[dr];W[eq]
(;B[br];W[cp]C[randalleg [10k\]: This seemed right to cut to me but I think I should have not, or I just carried it out very wrong]

(;B[cs];W[bq]
(;B[co]C[[krinid\] If you play here, you have to be ready to fight the ko!]
;W[cr]C[[krinid\] Ouch ... you can't let this happen!  Don't play C5 unless you have more ko threats and are willing to fight it out.]

(;B[bp];W[cq];B[bo];W[fl];B[en];W[eo];B[fm];W[gl]C[[krinid\] This is small.  Btw, white leaving A3 open is a mistake - perhaps it's a bit earlier to spend a move there now, but save those stones sometime later in the game.]
;B[fo]C[[krinid\] This is small.  White leaving A3 open is a mistake - save those stones!]
;W[do];B[dn]C[[krinid\] Bad move - you're forcing white to take your stone (bad - even if they're dead stones, on the board is always better) and solidify his stones with little gain.  Instead, tenuki.  Later, white playing D6 is not a problem - it's just a 1 point move.]
;W[ep];B[ff]C[[krinid\] Not bad but definitely not the biggest point available.  The top right corner needs reinforcement.  Now would be a great time for R14 to make some corner shape and pressure the R11 stone.]
;W[pf]C[[krinid\] So of course white plays in the nearly empty corner!]

(;B[oe]C[[krinid\] Very odd!  Is there a joseki for this or are you just experimenting?  P15 leads me to think you're trying to make territory at N17 (in which case, just play N17 or O17).  You should continue your solid, simple game of keeping your territorial lead and just secure the corner with R15 or O17.]
;W[oc]C[this move threw me off,

[krinid\] Ah yes, he's dragging you into a fight here.  Your P15 stone leaves the top side and corner weak, so he's exploiting the weakness.]

(;B[mc]C[it made me think p15 was a horrible idea to stat with

[krinid\] Agreed - P15 was horrible.  (;  Here, you should protect the corner and play Q17 instead.  N17 makes territory but still leaves the corner weak.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc];W[pb];B[nc];W[nb];B[od];W[ob]C[[krinid\] This is bad ... you've played moves which force white to solidify the top side.]

(;B[ng];W[qd];B[pg]C[[krinid\] You're forcing white to connect here.  Only attack it if you know you can break through it or if you are trying to reduce.  Here, when you fail to break through the stones, you just give white the connection he wants with little gain.  Instead play R9 or entirely tenuki with G11, O11, M3, H4, etc.]
;W[qg]
(;B[rh]C[randalleg [10k\]: this was dumb

[krinid\] Agreed ... white gains from this without doubt.];W[qh]
;B[ri];W[rj];B[qj];W[rk];B[rg];W[rf]C[[krinid\] White is played conservatively here.  White could actually play Q15 to make a bit more territory and threaten Q13/P15 or breaking out while still not having to worry about S13 living.]
;B[pj]C[[krinid\] I like that, not that it'll kill R11 or S10 (white can easily kill S12) but just because it's in the middle of the white group = a spot for black to grow from = less white territory.]
;W[oh]C[[krinid\] You have a choice: save Q13 or block off top center territory.]

(;B[nh]C[[krinid\] You chose to save top center territory, so now you should continue through with this, ignore Q13 and focus on making top center territory.  This may mean sacrificing Q10 now, but it's only 2 stones, so as long as you push out from O12 with O10 or N10, etc, you can still push from Q4 and R6 later to make up for the loss of Q10.]
;W[oi]C[[krinid\] This is where you need to continue making top center territory and push into the bottom center from F5 and Q4 & R6.  If you did that, you would win.]
;B[fh]C[[krinid\] Good!  Making that top center territory... keep it going!]
;W[pl]C[[krinid\] This is where you need to let Q10 die and focus on busting into the bottom center and blocking on the top center.]
;B[ql]C[[krinid\] This is bad because it gains little (a bit of territory on the bottom), does not save Q10, and does not contribute to territory on the top or the bottom.  So it doesn't achieve any of the goals you need to achieve.]
;W[qk];B[rl];W[pk];B[ni];W[nj]
(;B[oj]C[[krinid\] Wrong side ... you should have played N10.  I think this is the turning point of the game and the move that led to your defeat.  See the variations for better sequences.]
;W[nk]
(;B[li];W[hi]C[i felt here like I should not be passive but since i had such horrible exchanges at r11 and c3 groups I just held back]

;B[on];W[nn];B[no];W[oo]
(;B[mn]C[[krinid\] This won't work - it lets white cut you off and stop your entry.]
;W[nm];B[op];W[mo];B[np];W[mp]
(;B[mm]C[randalleg [10k\]: this whole exchange seems futile as well, I feel like I kept picking fights I couldnt back up, hadn't read through

[krinid\] Agreed.  See the variations of move 101 for better options.  As before, white should have taken more advantage of black here with a play like P7 instead of a staunch O8.  Actually O2 would be even better... seal off the bottom.  Black O8 or P7 is not really a threat compared to black N3.]

(;W[nl];B[mq]C[[krinid\] Good ... white left a weakness - exploit it!]
;W[lq];B[mr];W[lr]
(;B[nr];W[mb]C[i should have done this first

[krinid\] Agreed ... and B17 and A3 as well.]
(;B[lc]C[[krinid\] Too passive!  You need to cut this off.  See variations.]

C[[krinid\] Mistake by white ... this is too small and loses sente.]
;B[gg];W[gi]
(;B[bd]C[[krinid\] But you need to play at the biggest point - G4!  But for playing here, B17 is better.  Play B17, white B16, then move on and keep sente.  Here, you follow up with B17 and give sente away.  This is really the start of the end game now, so you can't afford to give away sente.]
;W[be];B[bc];W[gp]C[[krinid\] This move seals the game - it's done.]
