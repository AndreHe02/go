AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hello,

I will do my best to make a helpful review. Please let me know if you have more questions.

Overall, I think black played much better than his rating. So, 6 stone handicap is quite hard to overcome. However, I did notice that you made a few moves that I thought was slow. 

Some of your move are a bit too direct/forceful. In those cases, if black reads out the sequence correctly, then he will come out alright. You want to force  you opponent to make choices (ideally force him into making bad choices, and get in trouble). 

I hope you find the review helpful.

Best Regards,

Yuan Cao]PL[W];W[fq];B[jq]
(;W[dq]C[After going through the game, this seems like your favorite move (attaching underneath your opponent's stone). It forces your opponent into a fight. But, it forces you to keep playing locally at the same time. 

It seems like you are trying to trick him into making a mistake. But, you don't need to try to win directly from the beginning, especially in handicap games. That's not possible. He has a lot more stones on the board than you.

I gave a few alternatives that you might consider.];B[cq];W[cp]

(;W[eo]C[This move is a bit slow. It doesn't presure your opponent, and it doesn't get you territory. It doesn't even get you eyes. White should tenuki and play else where. 

Black playing E5 seems bad, but you can still make your white group live. You can't fix every weakness in a handicap game.]
;B[jo]C[Great move by black. This is one of the reason that I thought black was playing better than his rating.]
;W[in]C[VipassanaMan: Not sure what I was aiming for here...

Same comment as before. It's a bit slow. It doesn't really get you anything, and it doesn't threaten your opponent.]

(;B[jd];W[io]C[ White might make a small territory around bottom left side, but it's small. Black could play any 3,3 point at this moment and be comfortably in the lead.]

(;B[jj]C[A possible choice. Black seems confident in his ability to fight, since he's going after influence so much.]
