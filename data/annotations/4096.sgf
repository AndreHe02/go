C[Dear reviewer, first of all thank you for your efforts.
I went through the game myself and made some annotations and questions about some moves, but I am not all sure if that is important points.


Kakashisan: Hi! You're quite welcome, and I hope that you enjoy this review.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[dq];W[pp];B[co];W[jq];B[qj];W[cj];B[hq]C[Kakashisan: This is too slow for the speed of the opening. While its good to get the extension from the shimari (corner enclosure), it's a very small move. Right now, K-17 or 16 is a huge point for both sides.]
;W[jo];B[ho]C[Kakashisan: Again, leave this alone. Its way too small compared to the huge point.]
;W[qn];B[oj];W[nc];B[oe]C[Is the 5-5-point too defensive?

Kakashisan: I don't think so. Either this, or O-16.];W[qc];B[qd]
;W[pc];B[rc]C[Kakashisan: Save this hane for later. Again, its way too small, as there are much bigger points. I'd recommend F-17, and would keep the bottom right corner in the back of your mind, for later.]
;W[rb];B[rd];W[oc];B[lc]C[Kakashisan: I'd recommend N-15 or 16.]
;W[md]
(;B[kc]LB[jd:A]C[I thought a draw-back would help not to strengthen the white group - but then perhaps on the hoshi would be more like eye-shape, would it not?

Kakashisan: This is odd. A 2-point extension to J-17's fine for B. I don't like A, b/c it allows W to attack. Please see the variation.]
;W[hc];B[le]C[Kakashisan: Perhaps L-15 instead, this forces w to keep pushing, and create a strong line of stones bearing down on the right side.]
;W[me];B[lf];W[mf]
(;B[ng]C[Kakashisan: Can't defend the territory and settle the weak group at the same time, I'd prefer M-12 or L-12.]
;W[mg];B[nh];W[lg];B[jf];W[kg];B[jg];W[cf];B[fd]LB[ib:A][he:B]
[ji:C]TR[kc][lc][le][jf][lf][jg]C[Afterwards I realized that I weakened the marked group...
but where to play now?
A?  B? C?

Kakashisan: Ouch. I would play C here.];W[fc];B[ec]C[Kakashisan: Leave this alone, K-11 is the most important, you want to settle that weak group.]
;W[gd];B[ed]C[Kakashisan: This seems too passive. Locally, I'd play D-17.]
;W[dc];B[fb];W[gc];B[db];W[cb];B[ef];W[gf]C[Kakashisan: This is why B should leave the F-16 stone alone, by finishing that fight too early, the first weak group is still unsettled, and now B has another one on his hands.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[bc];W[bb]
(;B[df]LB[eg:A]C[Better at A?

Kakashisan: Yep.];W[bd];B[ei];W[cm];B[di]C[Kakashisan: I feel like G-12 would be much more positive.]
;W[ci];B[jj];W[lj];B[lq]C[Kakashisan: Yikes.I think this is an overplay. Right now I would play G-12, and apply pressure to the W group.]
;W[nq];B[lo];W[jm];B[lm];W[kl];B[lk];W[kk];B[kj];W[mk];B[ll]
;W[mj];B[nm];W[nl];B[km]C[I'd prefer the hane at O-8, or G-12, J-8.]
;W[jl];B[jn];W[in];B[kn];W[io];B[im]C[Kakashisan: I feel like this was one of the most important losing moves.]
;W[il];B[hm];W[hl];B[hn];W[gl];B[om]LB[ie:A]C[Here I wanted to chase white along...
Probably I should have defended instead?

Kakashisan: Yeah. Either G-12 to get the two B groups connected, or J-16.]

(;B[ge]C[Kakashisan: The variation that you included with the H-15 peep looks good. Coming out of this with one of the groups alive is better than both of them dying, hehe^^]
;W[he];B[ee];W[cg];B[dg];W[id];B[ic]C[Kakashisan: This is very bad for W, and only helps W to settle. J-18 is better, but right now, i think its more important to get J-13 in.]
;W[jc];B[ib];W[jb];B[hb];W[gb];B[ga];W[fe];B[ea]C[Kakashisan: This doesn't do anything for B. Please see the variation.]
;W[ia];B[dh];W[ch];B[gj];W[hi]
(;B[hj];W[ih];B[ii];W[ik];B[ij]C[Kakashisan: Instead, I would E-8 or D-8.]
;W[ki];B[ji];W[fk]C[now I tried some last desperate attempts to get the black stones to life.....]

;B[pl];W[pm];B[ql];W[oa]C[Kakashisan: Ouchies^^;; 

In general, here are the important turning points in the game:

The first moves in the opening: This wasn't as big a problem as later on, but it was still important enough.

The fight in the top left (starting with E-17, etc.). The creation of the second weak group was really painful for B, its important to keep that F-16 stone light, until you're ready to use it.

M-3: When W jumped into the center with K-7, that made things more painful for B, plus there was the invading group to worry about.

The J-7 cut: W will be happy to give up the bottom stones in order to attack the top. Plus, W always has M-2 later on.

Anyway, I hope that you enjoyed this review, and found it helpful. Thanks!

Sincerely,
Jonathan])
