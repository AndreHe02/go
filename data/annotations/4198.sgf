AB[dd][pd][dp][pp];W[fc]C[JM: Bernard,
    Thank you very much for the opportunity to review your game!  Although it was rather short, it provided some interesting choices, especially for white, at several stages.  You mentioned some of the most important ones in your questions.  I've done my best to illustrate some of the other possibilities that may have arisen and all of my comments are preceded with 'JM:'.  Please take all of my comments with a grain of salt, though.  I am a 1kyu* on IGS and only the professionals can say with certainty what the best move in a position is.

As I said in my final comment, I felt that at the point the record stops, black was doing very well.  In general, I felt that white was trying to win by using tenuki rather than attacking.  It may just be a matter of style, but, especially in handicap games, it is important to keep your opponent under pressure.  With 4 handicap stones, it is unlikely that white will win unless at least one black group dies.  White, however, did little to even create a weak black group.  This meant that all black had to do was play solid and simple, and he could come out well.

I'd recommend concentrating on the bases of your opponent's groups.  Try and undermine them to set a group floating and then attack them to build thickness and/or territory.  Unfortunately, there is little I can suggest for Black from this game.  Black played simple/solid, and there was little to criticize.]

(;W[ie]C[JM: J15 seems rather slow.  Yes, it would be nice if white could trick black into saving H16, but when black plays correctly and sacrifices it, J17 loses it's effectiveness.  On the other hand, if white had played the D18/C17 exchange first, then it could be reasonable. See variation.]
;B[ec]C[F18 seems like a urgent move but I ignored it hoping to play it later. As it happened my opponent played a couple of moves around here giving me 2 moves elsewhere during the fuseki.
Is there any alternative to F18?

JM: No, playing elsewhere is almost unthinkable.  If Black follows up at G17 the white position is ruined and Black is left with at least 20 points profit.  Even though this is a handicap game, I think F18 is essential.  It leaves open the option of invading at C17 later.  Generally, handicap games go better for white once a weak black group has been created, so you need to be thinking about taking away the base of some group.]
;W[ck]C[JM: Unless you think you can make more than 20 points with this move, it shouldn't be played.  This doesn't look up to the task.]
;B[fb]C[JM: White got off a little easy here, but still, black has only played one extra stone and sealed up a very large corner.  Meanwhile, the 4 white stones have lost their base.  White should not be happy.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[nc]C[JM: This is good.];B[qf];W[pn];B[he];W[qh]
C[JM: This is the right idea.  You need to make this corner vulnerable.]

(;W[pj]SQ[pg][pb][bp][ch][hq]C[I wasn't sure what to play here so i just defended.

JM: I've marked a couple of points here where it may have been better to play.  In particular, Q17 looks nice, followed by the split at Q13.  Again, the idea is to create a weak group.  See variation.]

;B[hb];W[ib];B[md];W[le];B[mc]C[Should I have attacked on the right? H19 seems very big.

JM: H19 is definitely huge.  Whichever side gets it will have no weak groups to deal with.  The right side can wait for now.]

(;W[fg]C[JM: In light of the ko that developed next, this was wrong.  Since there are no weak groups on the board, there is no threat big enough.]

[fs][es][ds][cs][no][ed]C[This is as far as i can remember.

JM: OK, It's still pretty early, but let's do a basic assessment.  I've marked likely white territory in squares and black territory in triangles.  B=29(UL)+32(UR)+11(LL)+6captured=77 W=10(R)+9(LR)+8(L)+3captured=30.  Generally, each handicap stone is considered to be worth about 10points. (10*4=40, 78-30=38) This means that after 78 moves, white has gained almost nothing.  In my opinion, the game is still certainly up for grabs, but black is doing very well.  In particular, both upper corners are very solid and very large.  A lot of white's problems can be traced back to losing the ko at e16. Had white been able to win that, it would be much more difficult for black.  In general though, creating the ko and the S8/P8 combination tell me that black is too strong to be given 4 stones.]

(;W[sm]C[JM: This black group is tough to kill, but this seems to at least give a better chance than S4.]
;B[rq];W[rr];B[qp];W[ml]C[JM: This looks better for white.  However, Black shouldn't have tried to live in the corner.  At any point, it would be better to run with N8 or O8.]
