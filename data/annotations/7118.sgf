AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, this is Chirality[1d\] and I'll be your reviewer for today.  You didn't include any questions, so I'll just tell you what I saw in this game...

You played very well against white in the local fighting, but played too passively.

In a handicap game, black begins with a large advantage.  If the game becomes even, he will lose.  So it is very important, as black, to maintain your advantage by keeping white on his toes.  If you defend too soon, you allow white to set the pace of the fighting, and it's just a matter of time until your advantage is gone.

I have some specific examples. :)];W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[pn];W[pr]
;B[iq]LB[fq:C][gq:B][qq:A]C[I would play A to keep up the pressure on white.  Your move is not bad, but white can play at A for a base.  Then your pincer looks like a failed attack. (and when white plays at B or C, you do not absolutely have two eyes, so this move is a little heavy also)]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[fo]
(;B[gr]LB[eq:B][dr:A]C[This is the right idea--deprive white of his base, while making your own.  The thing I don't like about it is that it's a gote move on the second line.  Since white did not play at A, you could play at B.  If white does not respond, you can connect underneath afterwards and there is no need to defend your group. :)

This was your first overly-defensive move.  Black is acting like he invaded white's bottom-side moyo, when in fact white has invaded black's bottom-side moyo--twice!]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[qq];B[qp]LB[qh:C][qi:B][qj:A]C[This was your second overly-defensive move.  How about extending to A, B, or C?

Your two stones are light, so you shouldn't play this way.  Now it's easy to end up with a weak group, and you've lost sente again.]
;W[ql]LB[qi:4][io:2][qp:3][gr:1]TR[iq][lq]C[Since the black group at the bottom is still in a little danger, I think white can look forward to this fight.  At least it makes things more complicated.  Black is still ahead, but a little less than before.

Just picture 1 at 2 and 3 at 4!  Wouldn't you feel better about the game?]
;B[qm]SQ[dd][pd][dn]C[Are you worried about eyes?  You shouldn't be.  Black still has a good influence on the board, so separating white by pushing out into the center will never be a bad strategy.

This move is OK, but you have to make sure you know why you're doing it. :)]
;W[pl];B[rq]LB[nn:A]C[Black is playing on the second line again, I see. ;)

I can't see any other move on the board but A right now.  Black can move out in style, preparing to attack the white stones on the right side of the board. (leaning on a strong group to attack a weak one is a very important idea)

Again, you're playing like an invader in white's moyo. :)];W[rr]
;B[pq];W[qr];B[ro];W[qf]TR[pl][ql][qm][ro][qp]C[Ask yourself which 3-stone shape looks bigger. :)]
;B[nd];W[of];B[ni]C[You are making white stronger.  You should play a move like this only when you are absolutely, totally sure that you never want to invade.]
;W[pi];B[ng]LB[fc:B][cf:C][mf:A]TR[ni][pi]C[The marked exchange didn't really cost you anything, so why do you want to keep playing in this area?  Nearby, A looks like a good light move to me, but B or C are reasonable moves right now.]
;W[nf]C[White always loves to make things complicated in handicap games.]
;B[mf];W[me]
(;B[lf]LB[ne:A]C[He is cutting you.  You HAVE to cut him.  Seeing white play A will make the corner very unhappy.

See the variation.];W[md];B[re]LB[ne:A]C[Can still cut!];W[oc]
TR[lf][mf][ng][ni]SQ[fo][no]C[The game is going a little badly for you.  You're losing a lot in the corner, and in exchange you got these stones on the outside.  But there are two problems:

1) White has gotten to play two jumps into the center, and has some sente moves against the black group at the bottom, so the influence of black's 4 stones is not enormous, and

2) These stones have no eyes. :)  Later they could turn into a weak group.]
;B[pc];W[od];B[rf];W[qe];B[qd];W[ob];B[pb];W[rg];B[rc];W[fc]
;B[hc]LB[hd:A][id:B]C[Given what happens here, it's safe to say that this pincer is too low. (though it's a good idea)  A or B would be a healthy way to play.]
;W[fe];B[df];W[id];B[kc]C[It's a fine idea for living, but the left side is wide open!  Playing in the wide open areas first is important.]
;W[kd];B[ic];W[jc];B[jb];W[jd];B[lb];W[db];B[cc];W[ch]C[White got to play on the left side.]
;B[cg]TR[lb][pb][cc][pc][rc][rf][qm][ro][cq][iq][rq]C[I've highlighted the defensive moves you've played in this game.  White has not defended at all.  In a real battle, who would you expect to win: the army constantly advancing, or the army constantly retreating?

To get an especially good idea of why this can be bad, look at this area later.  White got almost as much territory as you on this side!  Sometimes keeping your territory is the wrong way to play.]

;W[cb];B[bb];W[eg];B[fn]C[This cut is a good idea.  You can also wait until you are stronger in the center. (the fight didn't turn out great for you)]

TR[jb][lb][hc][ic][kc][lf][mf][ng][ni][el][fm][fn]SQ[id][jd]
[kd][fe][me][nf][of][eg][ch][pi][dl][pl][dm][em][en][no]C[Think about the state of the game right now.  White is behind on points, but he is getting a very strong center.  Now you have three weak groups to take care of.  Especially given that white is stronger than you, the game looks hard for black.]
;B[hp];W[gn];B[gm];W[hm];B[hl];W[gl];B[gk];W[fl];B[il]C[You will gain a lot of strength if you forget about moves like this.  There is no reason to play in this area just because you lost some stones. :)

I won't say anything more--white is now in a position to control the game, maybe even kill something.]
