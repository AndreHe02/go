Hi, this is your reviewer =).

Overall, I think you played well considering your rank. However, what you should do is to think before each move: how much is this worth, and is there a bigger play on board? On several occasions, you get stuck in a local fight, which has very little value, while there are many bigger points still to be played.  I've tried to point these out in a few occasions.

Your opponent knows some things about shape, and he plays a few quite nice tesuji, which land you in trouble.  Overall, black's shape is better throughout the game than whites, and this is what you should look for. Be careful that you don't build inefficient shapes, or weak groups in the middle (like you did now with the group around C8). Weak groups allow your opponent to attack them.  However, black does not read very well or deeply, and has problems counting liberties, which you do better than him. This allows you to make a big capture after the failed black squeeze.  I might call it even decisive, since it was worth about 20 points. The endgame could've then gone either way.

OK.  I hope this helps.  Thanks for using the Go Teaching Ladder :-).

(I have to say that I wonder about the score: By my count W wins by 27.5 points, but the SGF file lists the score as W+57.5.  Strange.)]

--   Typical answers are A and B.  If your opponent attaches, you should usually either extend or hane (turn the corner). See variations.

Note that you're not really invading, you're reducing. Had you gone lower, such as R5, that would've been more like invading. Fourth line is typically an influence line, third is territory.

The two white stones are not really connected and they can be cut apart, meaning that one of them (or perhaps both) are going to be weak. As you noticed, your opponent uses this to his advantage.]

Your influence is okay, but I think you got the short end of this bargain, though a stronger player would probably disagree - they value influence quite a lot.

Note how your Q5 stone ends up being useless, you could've gotten the same result by playing directly this far away from the black stones anyway.]

If you had clamped, you would only have strengthened black. See variation. This works nicely together with the marked stone, even though the area is still invadable.]

;W[hq]C[Here I made territory on the bottom.  i'm not sure if this was too timid.  I have a lot of thickness on the left side, and maybe I should have played against black's group on the left side.

--

You have no thickness on the left side. It's territory (thickness does not face towards the sides, unless it's in the centre). Black has thickness, yes.

Your move at H3 is absolutely necessary, unless you want black invading there and destroying all the territory. Good move (though it could've been one line higher as well.]
;B[lo]C[Nice eye-stealing tesuji from black. It seems that this guy has been studying =).]
;W[mp];B[ip];W[iq];B[jp]C[Now black is using his strength to press you down and reduce your territory.]
;W[jq];B[kp];W[kq]C[Not necessary. It's just worth two points, so you should go elsewhere. Plaing around G7 or O15 would probably be a good idea now.]

C[At this point I couldn't decide if I wanted to push against the stones in the center or invade.  The stones in the center appears to be very weak.

--

Well, it's not that weak, since it can run into two directions. However, your invasion is too easy to cut off - it's too far from neighbouring stones, and not close enough to the side.   Playing at A would probably be a better idea to stop black from playing there and getting the center territory.]

A protects against a white hane (which allows white to crawl in, B will reduce white corner territory (and is territorially big), and C protects the cutting point and at the same time, puts a bit of pressure on the white stone.]

(;W[cd]C[I had no idea what to do here.  I was thinking about B17, but I was afraid of that stone getting cut off.

No, the stone cannot be cut off.  See variation.  In fact, attempting to cut it off would be devastating for black.]
;B[cf];W[df];B[dh];W[bc];B[be];W[ej]C[I was hoping to make a big capture in the middle with this cut.  I got some, but maybe i should have been more agressive.

--

Well, black's middle is quite strong, since all stones are connected to each other. Cutting is a good move, but in this case, you should think more about reducing the opponent's area than killing stones.

You should've cut earlier, before black had the chance to make a living group on the left.]
;B[bk]
(;W[ho]LB[fk:A][hp:B]C[Playing at a would be much better. Your stone just gets cut off here.  Pushing at B is better than your move, too, since it leaves a cutting point behind, which has some potential. See variation.]

In my opinion, not really.  The stones are connected, so killing them is really difficult anyway.]

After that capture, the game is essentially over. Black has very little territory to speak of, white can erode most of it away, and white has both the top and bottom territories.

Let's count: Black has 10 points on the left, 30 on the right, 10 on the top right corner, and perhaps 15 in the center (which is generous, probably even less). Total of 70 points. White has 35 points on the bottom, and about 40 points on the top. He also has 10 more prisoners, so white is leading by at least 20 points now.

I am not going to comment the endgame with much detail, since white keeps the lead and continues to win this game. Both sides come about even in the end.]
