AB[pd][dp]C[KiraBox [10k\]: hello
tsuru [8k\]: hi
I played as black vs. my fearless opponent in white.];W[dd]
;B[pp];W[jq];B[fq]TR[lq]C[## Howdy player.  Should you have additional questions you can reach me on KGS as "BadSushi." 

## The over all theme of the game was that black placed too much value on infuence wich allowed white to get to get too much territory in return.  Black also failed to make good use of the gained influence, further putting black behind.  

Should I have extended to G3 here?

## F3 is a bit slow for me.  It is also very solid though.  I would prefer the marked move.  It builds some framework on the right side of the board, attacks white, and stops white from extending in that direction.]
;W[mq]C[## Here now, white has to much room, as you have already noted]
;B[pm];W[qi];B[pi]TR[qg][qk]C[## The white stone is weak, being inside of your influnce.  When you attach to a weak stone, like this, you will usually make it stronger.  I would prefer the marked moves.  


I thought this would be an interesting attack. He chooses one side and I take the other. Emphasis on outwards influence.]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[pj];B[ph];W[qh];B[nh];W[pr];B[oq]C[## This move is like "Hey white, I might be able to cut you later, you better fix that."]
;W[or]C[## and then white fixes it, again making white stronger then he needed to be.]
;B[qq];W[nc]TR[qh][qi][pj][qk]C[## Because white is so strong on the side, and under your stones, this move becomes a pain]

[og:8][pg:9]C[## Please see the variation first.   Here, White is settled and alive.  Black ends in Gote. He gets just 9 points w/ some influence & White can take the entire corner at R16 

I gave up my corner for influence and decided to split the groups locally.]

(;B[oh];W[nk];B[gd]SQ[mc]C[## At the very least you need a stone at n17 to make use of this move.   As it stands it's just a floating stone.  With another stone at the marked it would be a moyo move.  

I feel now that this approach was a bit high. I remember at this point I REALLY wanted to invade the corner, but figured he would get the outside influence that I wanted.]
;W[ic]SQ[gd]C[## Strong white move.  It punishes black's mistake.  Now not only is the marked a floating stone, it's under attack.  White will also now build territory either on the right or the left.]

Also note there are 27 possible points for black here, though white will probably get some reduction.  Also note white gets none.]
