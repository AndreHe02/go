RE[W+33.50]

AB[dd][dj][dp][jd][jj][jp][pd][pj][pp]C[Hello!
This is the first game I send in to the GTL.
I just started playing GO a week ago.Today I played SirSorrow, who is 21 kyu I think. I probably make a lot of obvious mistakes, but I would like to learn about them. SirSorrow gave me this handicap of nine stones and at the beginning it looked good I think, but I seriously messed up in the course of the game.
Thank you in advance, dear reviewer!

Hi, my name is Nathan.  I play at 14k on IGS as gringogo.  This is my first review so any comments would be appreciated.  I was very impressed with your opening game, building up a huge wall of influence around the center.  You failed to recognize this early enough in the game to capitalize upon it but you showed good sense in many of your moves, especially for the short amount of time you've been playing.  Keep studying and playing!  Realize that as a 14k player my advice is fallible.  I will try to contain my natural inclination for conjecture and confine my comments to those I think you will find useful. I am assuming that you are fluent in english, if this is not the case write me and I will simplify the language.. Here we go.]
;W[nq]C[
I didn't really know where to respond...

Some general points on this.  I highly recommend downloading Kogo's Dictionary of Joseki.  It is a huge database of standard opening variations.  I too have used the move you chose in the past and have found it problematic.  You might also find a copy of Otake Hideo's Opening Theory Made Easy, a quick read with many useful concepts that are general enough to be handy at your level of skill.  Get a go screensaver such as stonesaver.  They come with a large library of pro games which, though crazily complex. will pound the basics of opening theory into your head, also you can put your own games into the library to easily and repeatedly study them later.  The question of where to respond depends on what you hope to accomplish in this corner.  Do you want to secure the corner or build up influence, or spliit the corner with him.  Whichever path you take you should have a goal in mind, but not be bound to it. That said, we move on.]
;B[oq]LB[lq:4][np:3][oo:5][pn:1][pq:6][qq:2]C[I like these moves better than the one you chose. Though your move was not incorrect, it exemplifies the proverb "contact plays against weak stones strengthen them.]
;W[kq];B[jq]LB[hp:3][jo:2][np:1]C[This move is known as the iron post, it is solid and I like it. other choices were:
1 pressuring the stone you contacted
2 jumping to the middle 
3 building a framework of connectivity];W[no]C[When playing go, attempt not to merely respond to your opponents moves, but understand what they are after.  if you understand your opponent you can foil him down the line.

feeling he doesn't have much room, and wanting a position from which to attack blacks corner, w decides to jump out.]
;B[nm]LB[gp:7][hp:6][kn:8][kp:1][kr:5][mn:9][on:2][or:4][pm:3]
C[This move I do not like.  It has no connected relationship to other stones, and doesn't very effectively attack the white group.  you should be pressuring this group while it is weak, to secure profit and security on either side of it.

I like any of moves 1-9 better.];W[cq]C[This invasion was to be expected.  I think it it actually ill-timed, and that you can use it to build up influence and further weaken the white group at l-o 3]

;W[jc];B[ic];W[ib];B[hc]MA[dj][fd][fk][jd][jj]LB[fc:3][he:4]
[id:1][kd:2]C[this move is called hitting yourself on the head.  You are stealing your own liberties in order to blindly try to kill the white stones.  again, if white wants that territory so bad as to play on the second line for it, maybe you should let him have it and profit elsewhere.  You already have a nice sphere built up with the marked stones, play accordingly.  also remember that white is looking for a way to break your ladder.]
;W[hb];B[fc]LB[gd:1][kc:2]C[trying to kill an invasion against a stronger player hurts you.  That is what white wants, he uses his natural advantage in calculation and battle experience to take advantage of your overaggressiveness.

[ci:1][db:4][de:3][dg:2][jb:6][kc:5][kp:8][kr:9][nc:7]C[your next move is running scared without considering whether or not youu are threatened.  Better moves at numbered spots.  White used this move to settle the corner]

;W[lb];B[ne]LB[lf:1]C[o17 would have been better wouldn't it?  I like your move better than o17, because of the surrounding board position still would have played at 1 though]
;W[nd];B[oe];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qb]LB[qe:1]C[my opinion but I think with the surrounding position you're better off making him fight for the corner and then sealing him in.]

wouldn't have stopped it, the one move you used in there I would have used to seal him up]
;W[sd];B[of]C[The upper right corner seemed dead to me now... I will be taught better later on...   :)

;W[me];B[kf];W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[pq]LB[ro:1]C[this move forces him into bad bunchy shape.  This is his 4th tight territorial invasion.  He is playing over territorially, and were you to recognize this, you could punish him for it.  Just a few moves and the whole center could be yours.]

containment is your best policy.  Play to your strengths and your opponents weaknesses.  he wants to play territorially, so let him.  Getting into a complicated battle here only helps him and costs your the middle in the end.]
;B[mn]TR[km][ko][lr]LB[kp:1][lm:2][mp:4][nn:3]C[1 looks like sente to me, he has to respond
2 begins the containment process more safely
3 also threatens stones and forces him to respond 
or you could go a different route with 

4.  Plant a stone in the middle of his weak group and then threaten to save it, he will react by trying to keep you from it which lets you make heinous sealing in follow up moves like the triangles]

If you had to make it, 1 is better shape and prevents white from atariing your shape locally.  check it for yourself so you can confirm this.  This is a major theoretical point I would like to make, never ever ever assume that there is only one way to do things in go.  If you are attacked, and you see a weakness that you must protect, don't automatically assume that the most obvious way to protect something is the best, look for moves that protect and attack, defend and strengthen, connect and spread.

Well afterwards I do  :(];B[gr]MA[dr][eq][er]LB[jr:1]C[this cutting point you should have seen.  you already have good access to this territory from the marked position, make sure your moves focus on groups that can still be killed.]

giving up any one of a number of small groups of stones or attempted killing moves could have prevented this, recognizing the size and urgency of different moves is a skill that you will develop.

I will play live teaching games with you for free, for I'd like to see you advance, you hold great promise.]

;B[ik]C[the middle is dead the midgame is over. endgame begins. there isn't really much up for grabs, not enough to let you win at least.  If I were you at this point in my go playing career, I would focus on theory in the opening and midgame, rather than worrying about the most efficient endgame moves.  This will decide most of the games that you will play in the next several months.

I should say at this point that in the review of this game I have counseled you over and over to take influence in the middle over territory on the sides.  This advice was based on my rudimentary positional analysis of this particular board and does not reflect a general preference of influence in the middle over secure border territory.  This said I think that you severely UNDERESTIMaTED the worth of the middle and in doing so lost a game which you could have won, and a stunning upset that would have been.  If I were 21 k and beat by someone who had been playing less than a week I would fear them forever....]
