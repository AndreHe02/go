C[To the reviewer:

Thank
you in advnace for reviewing my game.  I really have no idea where I'm going
wrong.  I keep getting all sorts of different advice from stronger players,
and none of it seems to be helping me.  I've been told to attack more and
not play so passively, yet when I attack, I end up with weak groups all over
the place.  If I play so as not to end up with a bunch of weak groups, I
get criticized for playing moves that give up sente.  If I play moves with
the intention of keeping sente, I end leaving one or another group in trouble.

In
short, I seem to fall behind very big fairly early in the game and have to
try desperately to catch up.  None of my attacks seem to work, while my opponents'
attacks always leave me with weak groups.  When I get sente, I find myself
racking my brain trying to figure out where to play.  And what's worse is
that my opponents always seem to play so much faster and more effortlessly
than I do.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger
(Fedya on KGS)];B[pd]C[Hello, I'm Fernando Grant (Kokorini), I will make this review trying to explain what I think you misstake cosidering your questions
like: Where to play now? And now? NOWWW??? Problem that I think is a veeery common one in all levels.
Of course I review probably wouldn't be the better one, but... I will try.
so, lets see....];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[nq]C[Fedya:
I thought about this move quite a bit.  I realized that already, I'm not
certain what to do.  There's a choice between playing around C11, and attacking
in the top right corner as well.  I thought about the proverb that it's better
to attack from the open side, which means that O3 or O17 is better than R6
or R14.  O3 seems to have allowed Black to get a nice moyo fairly quickly
-- but when I attacked at R14, the result was an utter disaster.

I'm
beginning to think that I should try something completely off the wall like
make my first move as White a 3-3 invasion, taking a small amount of territory
in all four corners and hoping that my opponents have as much trouble using
influence as I do.  Nothing else is working.

Kokorini: I think is move is fine, probably my move too. I like the side, the open one.

And for the 3-3 invasion I think is too soon now. I mean, going directly to a small corner giving black allready an extension on Q10, even when you end the secuence in sente becouse I think we can image that black end in sente an play on Q10.]
;B[lq];W[qq]C[Fedya: Would it have been better here to play at O5 instead?

Kokorini: I think: Yes. for the reasons I gived to you in the other move. Usually, you will invade the 3-3 after a pincer witch is an extension of a force. For example, if the D4 was black and the the pincer stone played more close to K3. (of course, think that if black have a stone on D4 is becouse you have another around Q16).]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo];W[ci]C[Fedya:
I didn't really know what to do, but I figured this was no worse than anything
else.

kokorini: I like this one. you are getting about the allmost same amount of territory on the left side than your opponent using only 3 stones. Of course it can be invade easly, but this is just the beginnig.]
;B[jc]
(;W[fq]C[Fedya: Another move where I had absolutely no idea
what to do.  In retrospect, I probably should have played at C3 to ensure
that Black can't invade in the corner and leave me with nothing but influence.

Kokorini: Well, first, influence is not bad if you know how to use it, buuuttttt.... that could be a problem for some of us :). So I think we just have to learn about it. any way, if B invade the 3-3 on leftdown corner, the situation is similar to the other corner, so that can be that bad. And think that you will end the joseki in sente.
Anyway, I think the idea of this move (even when you doesnt have that) was too close of D4 and too far from M3 (O2 too) I like a lot more to play at H3, and if you dont like the idea of B play F3 after it (us I do) the play G3 leaving a very interesting move to do later: K2. See var.]
;B[jj];W[iq]C[Fedya: I decided to try to take some territory on the side, since I thought that was the biggest thing.

Kokorini: Us I show in the past comments and variants, White can make this playing on G3 or even on H3.
I think now W is a little overconcentrated there, considering the other posibility.  That in one hand, and in the other, this is helping B to make a moyo in the center, using the center stone in a very confortable way just playing where B played................]
;B[jo]C[here];W[cm]C[Fedya: Another wasted opportunity to play C3.

Kokorini: Dont worry that much about C3. The problem here is that he have too much influence in the board than you after this.

And playing here is making blink that point: Black would think: '' OH!! if I play on C3 and he orient his wall to the north the stone he just played will be too close, and If he play on C3, I will loose any chance to invade there, I better do that NOW!'']
;B[cq]C[Fedya: Now I have to deal with a corner invasion, which means I'm going to end up with influence instead of territory.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[dr];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[ar]
;W[cs];B[bs]C[Fedya:
Here I realized that Black will live in the corner, but at least I've got
sente.  As usual, though, I didn't know what to do.

Kokorini: well... lets imagine that you havent invade the 3-3 on R3, and you played at O5, your opponent chase you a little, if you want you make a little base play at Q3, or leave aji to make a future invasion on the corner. The point is that with out that wall, now your move is the 3-3 on R17. Maybe it is allready, buuuutttt I dont like sooo mmmuuuch becouse it complement very good the other wall.]
;W[qf]LB[nc:A][qc:B]C[Fedya:
To me, it's clear that I have to do something on the right side, in order
to prevent Black from getting a huge moyo.  The only things I can think of
are R14, O17, or R17.  The last time I tried an early 3-3 invasion in the
corner in a game a stronger player reviewed, I was criticized quite severely
for the invasion, so I rejected the invasion here.  I don't like O17 as much
as R14 because I think Black ends up with a better formation after the resulting
joseki.  A Black wall parallel to the stones at P4-R4 would be better than
one perpendicular to it.

Kokorini: i'm agree, I think is good to play there now.];B[qe]
;W[pf];B[nd]C[Fedya: I was worried Black would play something like R12 here.
kokorini: You have to!];W[qi];B[qj];W[rj];B[rk];W[ri];B[pi]
;W[gc]C[Fedya:
In retrospect, this was probably a mistake.  But I thought the situation
on the right was settled.  I probably should have played at S15, even though
you'll criticize it for giving up sente.  Either that, or Q12, as I have
to worry about Black playing at R12.   The problem is, when I settle the
group on the right, Black will get the opportunity to play something big
elsewhere on the board.  Yet at the same time, I had to play on the right
side in the first place to prevent Black from getting a huge amount of territory.

kokorini: yes, your group need another move I think. Now you kwon that.
The point is that black want to do now is to make that group weak, so chase it and make a moyo with place for 3 cars and a big pool (big moyo)
And that was what happend.];B[rg];W[rf]C[Fedya: I wasn't certain of the best thing to do here, so I decided to try to kill the S13 stone.
Kokorini: bad idea.];B[qh]
(;W[ph]TR[qi][ri][rj]C[Fedya:
As soon as I played this, I realized I was in effect sacrificing the three
marked white stones.  But I don't think S12 is much better.  See the variation.

kokorini: I think you are right, I comment a little that var.]
;B[rh];W[oh];B[nf]
(;W[mh]C[Kokorini: Weeelll... black now have just what he want, a weak group, yours of course.

I have been looking variations playing at P10 an not here, And I think is better becouse you use those 3 stone that you leave behind and you enter a little on black's land. I will make some of this variations, but there are a lot.]
;B[mj];W[kh]C[Fedya:
I had no idea where to get eyes, so I figured I'd run out into the center,
and hope for the best.  Black is kind enough to let me connect all to the
group all the way on the left, but Black gets a huge amount of territory
while so doing.

Kokorini: Well, you can do a eye in gote playing on R13, so, you need another one :)
And it have the espected result, a moyo.];B[kf];W[ih]C[or maybe 2 moyos!]
;B[if];W[cf];B[gj];W[gh];B[gf];W[eh]
(;B[hn]C[Black can cut for example on K12, but I think you live, lets see (var)]

(;W[eo]TR[eq][fq][iq][fr]C[Fedya:
Here I realized that Black had ladder breakers that would enable him to play
at E4, so I wanted to protect that and save the marked stones.

Koko: Lets see what happend if black cut (var on this move)]

I think you your bigger problem was the overconcentrated stones at the downleft corner, witch ends invaded. If you use those stone some where else, you may have a lot of chance.
