C[chosan: Hi!

David: Your extension on the top and your 3-3 invasion were both too early when there were bigger moves available on the right side.  

You missed the way to live in the lower right, but you could still give it up and make big moves on the right and have a reasonable game.

you seemed to lose confidence when your 3-3 invasion died.  It you count the territory you will find that the game is still even, so you can afford to take territory on the right.

You could have lived at the end and been behind, but close enough to have a chance to catch up.]

;W[cm];B[ic]LB[fq:B][qp:A]C[There are bigger moves.  Enclosing a corner at A is bigger than playing on a side.  The upper side has stable positions on both sides, so any move on the upper side is small.  If you want to play on a side, the lower side is bigger, because it is wider, and the groups on each side are not as strong.]
;W[gq]
(;B[cq]LB[pj:B][qp:A]C[I think this is playable but I cannot get it to work. Black supposed to be able to get the corner.

You can take the corner, but it is way too early.  If white plays here he only gets a small corner, and you are happy to take two moves elsewhere.  For example, say you play A, he takes the corner at your move 13, and you play B.  You gain a  lot by this exchange. So you should take a big move now and save the invasion for later.

If you wait until later you will probably have ko threats just in case the corner becomes a ko.]

(;B[cp]LB[bp:A]C[It's hard to live with this move.  When white is close on both sides the diagonal move at A is usually better.]

(;B[ec]LB[kc:A]C[no ko threat

You can still make a big framework on the right side in exchange for this corner.

You do gain a lot on the upper side with this ko threat.  You ge thick so white can't invade around A later.  That's worth a lot of points, so the game is still close.]

;W[ei]C[Here my position is getting worse];B[ck];W[dj];B[bl]
;W[el]C[Even here your position is not so bad.  White has very little territoy and you still have a lot of potential on the right side.

White is very thick near your 3 stones so you should not try to pull them out.  White will get a lot of free moves while chasing them, even if they live.  Instead you should build up your right side, and sacrifice the three stones.]

(;B[gp]C[Your decision to pull out this small weak group is really bad. It throws away a game that you can still win.]
;W[hp];B[qp];W[lq]LB[hp:B][gp:A]C[You can see that the exchange of A for B strengthened white so he can extend to 48.]
;B[ho];W[ip]C[should I play that group or just give them up

The last two moves gave white considerable territory on the lwoer side for no compensation.]

(;B[gk]C[should be G8?  

No.  white will cut.];W[gm]C[that hurts

The easiest way to win a game is to chase a weak group against your thickness while getting many think moves on the outside. You started with a worthless 3 stone group (just 6 points if you give it up), and you are giving white far more than six points on the lower side and in thickness in the center.  Even if you live now, white's thickness will prevent yuo from making much territory on the right side.]

When you live you take gote and white is so thick in the center it will be hard to win.  But white doesn't have a lot of secure territory, so you are not so far behind.]
