AB[pd][dp]C[jkmfin [15k?\]: hello
AtariZ [13k\]: hi

Hartz: I would try to point out "bad" moves and then show you what I think would be better but as I am only 5k you dont have to take my advice as the "only" moves.]
;W[pp];B[qn]C[hartz: It is usually better and simpler to play on the empty corner. It is not a mistake but just make the things complicated and thus better for the stronger player.]
;W[dd];B[fc]C[Hartz: Again not bad, but it is usually better to attack white on the LR corner at O3, for example.]
;W[qf];B[nd]C[Was O16 too defensive?

hartz: O16 is fine, but I would have played a pincer around r11 because that move is also an extension from r6. Moves that make two things at the same time are very valuable and usually the better.]
;W[cn]
(;B[qp]C[Any other point I should have taken? The 3-3 point perhaps?

Hartz: This is the first move that I think it is bad.

r4 is a joseki WHEN black is weak and want to get a stable group in the corner. But black can and should attack white. Look at variations.]
;W[pq];B[po]C[hartz: Q5 is good when black wants to play on the right side.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[id]C[Perhaps too close to F16 group?

hartz: the proverb says "extend three spaces from a two stone wall" 

Another question is if it is better to play high at k16 or low at k17. Usually is good to keep a high-low balance so maybe k17 is the recommended move.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[oo]C[I really didn't feel too good about this. But was afraid I had to live small on the side so decided to threaten Q3 group. Maybe wrong timing for this move? Or even wrong place?

hartz: black has lost the oportunity of attack one weak group because white has defended it. P5 is a very good point for attacking Q3 stones through. R9 is good also.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[dl];B[jp]C[hartz: This time I think that k4 is one space too far from d4 stones]
;W[nq];B[lq]C[hartz: Now black is using the proper technic. Making territory while attacking. This way white is worried about living and can´t think about any nasty moves :)]
;W[mr];B[lr];W[qq];B[rp]C[Was this necessary? Would it have been better idea to go somewhere around G4 at this point?

hartz: S4 is sente about the corner because if white dont defend, black can kill him. So it is a good move.]
;W[hq];B[ho]C[hartz: white feels that black side is too big and there is enough room to invade. When you are invaded, you must think about if it is posible to kill the invasion and if you dont know how to kill then how may you take profit at another area for the invasion. 

H8 tells that you are going to force white to live inside.]
;W[fq];B[gp];W[ip];B[io];W[dr]
(;B[gq]C[hartz: I dont like g3 very much. If you cut out f3 playing at e2 you could kill white. Look at the variations.]
;W[er]
(;B[fp]C[I was afraid that I'd lose the D4 group..

Hartz: It is possible to divide at g2 but the continuations are quite difficult. Look at the variations.]
;W[gr];B[iq]C[hartz: now what was black points are white, so this is a bad result for black. To make things a little worse, black ends in gote, he lose the iniciative.]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[hc]
(;W[rq]C[hartz: this is another opportunity lost by black. It was possible to kill white playing at s2. Look at the variations.]
;B[mq];W[nr];B[np];W[ir];B[eq];W[fr];B[jq]C[Perhaps somewhere close to tengen would have been better now?

hartz: I think that defending at k3 is important. If not, all black stones would be weak.

The problem is that black has points only at top while white has three corners and almost the whole left side. Black is very behind on territory.]
;W[kd]
(;B[lc]C[hartz: if black want to keep most points at top, the usual move is contact at l17. Look at variation.]
;W[ld]C[hartz: white is kind on black. L17 is much more severe.

Anyway is better for black L17. Look at variation.]
(;B[mc];W[kc];B[jf]C[hartz: This is a move that show a fighting spirit. Very good.

When you are strong and your opponent is weak you must think about attacking.]
;W[je];B[ie];W[if];B[jg]C[hartz: Again another good attacking move.]
;W[ig];B[ke];W[jd];B[le];W[ji]C[This white move I didn't like]
;B[lg]C[hartz: very good shape, good for attacking hard.];W[dh]
C[hartz: white decides that he can´t live at top, so he secures most of the left side.]

(;B[kk]C[Now it started to look bad for me. I wanted to use my wall on down to make territory but didn't know how anymore.. So I just tried this

hartz: the idea is good but usually it is not good to use walls for making territory, walls are better used for attacking.

Probably the only chance for black is to invade at c10 but I know that is very difficult to have the courage for doing it. Look at the variation.]
;W[ll];B[kl];W[lm];B[lo]C[Perhaps too defensive? And surely too small

hartz: Yes, very small and not needed at all because black is connected and strong.

If you wanted to make points, E7 or F8 are good moves. Another idea is to keep the pressure on M8 stones.]
;W[ol];B[rk]C[hartz: Black move is on the right direction but it is too low. For a long time r9 was a good extension that threat to attack white

White has two groups more or less weak. One of the best tactics is to attack one group to get strong and cut off or kill another group. This should be your first thought on positions like this.]
;W[rl];B[ql];W[qk];B[rm];W[rj];B[sl];W[rc];B[pk]C[I attacked the P8 and M8 groups hoping to kill those and come back to the battle.

hartz: Very good idea.];W[qj];B[ok];W[oi];B[mj];W[lk];B[kj]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[qa];B[pa];W[qd];B[pc];W[nj];B[nk];W[lj];B[li]
;W[ij]C[hartz: Another success for black. Good.

Black stills has chances if he dont let white get territory around j14 and d12 stones.]
;B[il];W[rb];B[ni]C[hartz: This is very small. O10 stone is not important at all.

Moves like g8 or e15 then f13 are much more important.
J13 stones have bad shape, and black j12 it is a good attacking move.

Of course, the invasion of c10 is risky but huge.];W[oj];B[oh]

;W[fi]C[Should I have continued to E11?];B[ph];W[qh];B[pf]C[This was just an idea which proved to be not so good instantly after I played it :)

Hartz: this kind of moves must be read before playing. It is not enough that "look" good.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[pg];B[nf];W[ei];B[en];W[co];B[dm];W[el];B[ed]
C[Maybe wasted stone?

Hartz: not wasted but very very small and losing the iniciative. Almost any move is better than this.

At the end of the game it is very important to keep the iniciative, moves like t3 and d6 are very big because any player could gain some points AND go on playing.]
;W[dn];B[fo];W[ga];B[ha];W[fa];B[dc]C[hartz: this cut dont works.]
;W[db];B[cc];W[cb];B[og];W[pf];B[sq]C[Hartz: Good ¡¡];W[ls]

(;B[kr]C[I was afraid to put on L1. Propably would have been better?

hartz: You must try to read a few moves ahead. Look at the variation.]
;W[ks];B[hp]C[hartz: this is not needed because white can´t connect so why play it?]
;W[hr];B[js];W[sr];B[sp];W[ms];B[jr];W[rr];B[ik];W[hj]C[hartz: Probably the best move for black is j12]

[lp][mp][kq]C[Hartz:

Final commentary:

I think that you are too worried about defending but when you think at attacking you get good results. So attack more ¡

Reading a book about joseki or looking at strong players games would help you in the opening. Look at the table, you have no corner, that is usually very bad.

But in my opinion where you can improve more is at keeping the iniciative or "sente". You have not had the iniciative during the game but for a very little moves. That is very important.

You have played very solid most of the time and there is almost no black stoned killed. That is good ¡

Of course this are only my thoughts about this game and I may be wrong but ask me about any comment if you like.]
