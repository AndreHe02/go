C[

pmurphy:  Hi!  I'm Pmurphy, 9K on KGS at time of this note.  I took white in this game.  I managed to eke out a victory, but I think there was plenty I could have done better.  Thank you for the courtesy of this review!

djna:

My pleasure. I have taken the liberty (no pun intended) of removing the chatty comments, hope that makes the review easier to follow.

Overall the summary of this game is that both sides made reading errors which affected the course of the game. The status of the bottom left Black group was indeterminate for too long. W got a losing poistion (and the big quesiton for W is how come that happended), but then got away with an unreasonable invasion (and that's the big quesiton for B, why did he live?). So for improvement I'd suggest both players get lots of nice Tesuji and Tsume go books and solve the problems. Also both players seemed to be much too trusting about believing supposedly sente moves. Fun game though :-)

I have a couple of general observations.

1). Longer time limits do give the opportunity to play better go, the trick is to know where to spend the time. It's especially important to do three things:
a). Try to estimate the score now and again - and use that estimate to adjust what you do. So late middle game your commet that the upper right is really big and you are behind by 20 points, you then decide to make an infeasible invasion and get away with it,  so you win. This is really bad strategy, you need to take action against that framework long before. Your score estimate needs to see that 20 point deficit waaaay earlier.

b). There are certain crucial fights were one needs to read. If you have time, thats where to spend it. So clearly the invasion in the bottom right is one such place. there are also various end game mistakes. Here again if you have time figuring out the values of moves and picking big ones is essential.

c). Following on from this. Always think about sente. When you have time ask the question, can I ignore this? Seek to play elsewhere. And conversely, suppose I play  this and he doesn't answer do I really have a devastating follow up.

2). I hope that this next piece of advice isn't offensive, apologies if it is. Try to avoid talking about moves and positions while the game is in progress. I would never want to be unfriendly, a little conversation (where are you, what time is it ...) can be nice. But my observation in general is that there's a slippery slope when it comes to talking about the game. "Ooh that nearly worked, pity about that liberty at X can actually tell the opponent more than he knows (bad for you), alert him to aji that's important later, or worse mislead him as later you discover something more about the position. Best to say nothing about the game.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ed];B[ce]LB[kc:B][cd:A]TR[qd]C[djna: Uncoventional approach to 5-4 stone.

I beleive that this is a bad move, and a bad result ensures. I would either play the conventional A or  consider something around B. A quick search of joseki literature to hand shows now examples of B's move.

The idea of B is that W has played a move that promises thickness in that direction, so play a move that neurtralises that thickness and also woks with the marked B stone]
;W[cd]LB[cc:A]C[djna: seems like a decent response, an alternative of just playing, a dividing the corner would also be an way of playing]

(;B[de]TR[bd]C[
djna: I wonder whether a hane as marked is better, see variation]
;W[dd];B[ci]LB[ee:A][ck:B]C[
djna: I view this as not very satisfactory for B, his two stones are looking heavy, short of liberties and wating to be pressed some more. As W I am eyeing A and B. The idea is not that W can kill but by pressing on the outside can build strength. 

Meanwhile B really has no great growth potential from this group]

(;W[cm]LB[ck:A]C[
djna: I think a good idea as it preempts B playing down here and building someting that makese snese of his group.

I'd prefer to be really aggressing and play  A, I doubt that B can ignore that]
;B[oc]C[

djna: a decent development point for B];W[pj]C[
djna: this is the right direction. But why high? theory here is  4th line does not make a base. Surely you need a base? so play third line]
;B[jc]LB[ql:B][pp:A]C[

djna tricky to know where to play. This is good becuase both sides want this point. But Black A is a bit lonely. I would prefer to strengthen my weakest stone and attack W a little. How about B?]
;W[gc]LB[hc:A][lc:B][qn:C]C[

djna: Very conservative

I think you're just defending, but B didn;t really threaten much with his previous move. 

I guess perhaps you're concerned that B next will play here at G17., but if he did surely you're so strong there you can look after your group?

The problem here is that this is a purely defensive move., A, might threaten B and so be a little more active.


I think a move around C is more like it. W needs to sketch out some big territory to match B's top right.]
;B[qh]LB[qj:A][jp:C][cq:D][jq:B]C[
djna: making sense of the shimari and threatening to undercut W's high stone.

Nice idea. Downside is that this is just a bit cramped. reaally B wants to go as far as A, but can't because W is already there

I would prefer B or C because this is an area both sides want.

B is a rally nice point for W because then a B invasion at D still leaves  W with a nice mojo.]
;W[pm]LB[qh:A][pj:C][jq:B]TR[qk][rk][sk][ql][rl][sl]C[

djna: this feels like a purely reactive move - what's the long term aim? How much territory can BW hope for here after this? A undercut from the top. There's no opportunity for significant growth, can W expect any more than the 6 marked points?

I would play B. treat C as a light stone, very hard to suppress with one more move by black..]
;B[jq];W[gq]LB[cm:C][dp:B][eq:D][gq:A][qq:E]TR[gc][pj][pm]C[
djna: this is a bad move. See Sensei library on the butterfloy formation http://senseis.xmp.net/?KannonBiraki

a). With B&C in place A adds little value because B can invade at the 3-3 and A will end up too close to W's wall.

b). it puts no pressure on B.

Instead either play D to make the corner much stronger, or invade at E

Already, the ,marked  low value moves are making W's territory look a bit small.

An important idea is not just to count what each player has, but also consder how it can grow.

W cannot make top left any more valuable. cannot build a large territory of the right and so has just one growth area  in the bottom left.

B can grow all his three areas, top and bottom right substantially]
;B[mq]LB[qo:A]TR[pp][jq]C[

djna: this is a little slow and over concerntrated , but connects B's two stones together nicely.

If I thought W woulkd answer A, then I would love to play that first.

The problem here is that B has a hard time knowing how to answer the 3-3 invasion]

(;W[qq]LB[je:A][oh:C][qo:B]C[

djna: I believe that  W is entitled to this invasion. I just wonder whether W should first do something about the top right.

W has to assume that B will get sente and play something such as A.  

If Black gets to play B before W invades then he probably gains 20 points.
If Black gets to play A before W invades he probably gets a little less BUT  he threatens to grow further with a move at C.

I think that's why I would play at the top as W. With luck you might even get to to come back to the 3-3 invasion.]

(;B[qp]LB[pq:A]SQ[pj][pm]C[

djna: why here? A wall facing the marked stones is useless.

Play A. Black is then completely solid. W then either lives, but yields sente and may damage the marked stones or leaves the area and the invasion has failed]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[rp];B[ro];W[op];B[oo]C[Aristos [3k\]: at move 29, why not defend as black by just O3 ?

djna: Yes B must connect.. This is an example of a place where reading is absolutely essential.]

(;W[qo]LB[po:C][np:B][op:A][qp:2][qq:1]C[

djna: When I first looked at this I thought: "good that he's prepared to give up stones, it's a common mistake to hang on to stones., but that A stone looke really important. so bad decision"

But the actual result turns out quite well. The big question here concerns W's analysis. What did he actually think about. If ever there is a position where long time limits give time to consider options this is it.

The first thing to consider is what happens if W hangs on to the A stone. I show that variation on the previous move. I'd view that as a "par" result. It's what both sides should have expected  after 1-2.

The second thing is what result W expects after giving up A. 

The game continuation seems like a decent result for W, especially if he can get sente.

However B need not give this result. look at the variation from here.

I think the variation shows that  althought this move is a nice idea B has a better answer.

So, the important thing to take from this is the kind of analysis to do. I think reviewing games should not be about finding intricate variations, but about learning what to think about over the board.

Here W must realise that if this move is a mistake (as I beleive) it comes from not analysing both B's possible responses - B and C. The old proverb "there are  two ways to give atari" is a reminder to consider more options.]

(;B[np];W[po];B[op];W[rn]C[

djna: the situation is now resolved, both sides are live on the outside - so can we play elsewhere?]

(;B[pr]LB[rq:A]C[

djna: surely A is better if you are going to play here? But  this is now an argument about a few points. Who ever plays here first  gains about 10 points but loses sente. In other words a move here is worth about 5 points! 

There is no strategic significance here. Both sides are solid and stable, play elsewhere.

Further conclusion W probably cannot expect sente from his original 3-3 invasion. Hence The upper side *was* more important.]
;W[qr]LB[so:2][rq:1][rr:3]C[

djna: This should be the losing move!! Well a slight exageration, but B has just given  W sente, and W has given it back!

Worse this does not even work! 1,2.,3 kills .];B[rq];W[so]
(;B[os]C[

djna: urgh, no, varaition, but worse, why play here at all? Why argue over 3 unimportant stones?]
;W[rr]C[pmurphy [10k\]: you kept sente, good job!
solovely [11k\]: if i wouldn't i'd be loser here
solovely [11k\]: let's do it again!


No he didn't. You gave him sente. Why do you care about 3 stones? Devastate the top right.]
;B[cq]C[
djna: Build the top or redude the corner? Hard decision. My take is that B can grow faster than W so building the top is better. However if he keeps sent B is surely going to win]
;W[dq]LB[dj:A]C[
djna: wonder if going the other way is better, move for W around A might be fun with a wall facing that way.]

(;B[bq]C[
djna: variation is better];W[ip]LB[bm:A]C[
djna: why not A now? surely sente. B's upper left group starts to look very isolated.

I can understand wanting to play here, imagine B playing this point; W's wall would look useless.]
;B[iq];W[hq]LB[dj:C][bm:A][br:B]C[

djna, tricky to choose between here and H4 or J5. This take territory at the edge but gives the intiative to B. Think I would play H4 and expect either to play  in the top right or  A, B, C squence]

djna: it's annoying to have B push us around.];W[io];B[oh]LB[jc:A]
[cg:B]TR[lc][mc][kd][ld][md][nd]C[

djna: I think a good idea. Big question is how W now keeps that area under control.

I would look for moves in the marked area the plan we want is to isolate the A stone.

we then have  some ideas of pressing against the B group]
(;W[ee]LB[cg:A][bm:B]C[
djna: may be an idea to build strength before invading, but i feel that this is pushing from strength rather than towards it. It encourages B to solidify.

I'm not clear what B would do about a violent move at A, especially of W has played B first]
;B[eg]C[

djna: this ought to be a bad move, still leaves C13 as a weakness]

(;W[bk]C[

djna: need a clear strategic objective. I would want to confine the group and benefit by building my moyo or gaining strength to reduce B. A low move like this should be viewed with suspicion.]
;B[dk]C[

djna:  and this why low moves are often bad.


exactly the opposite result from the one W wants. B building on the outside is no good]

djna: the next few moves see B building strength while W tries to hang on to a relatively small area. W must find an alternative.]

djna: compare the result - W has gained no more than B.

All the time the top right is needing attention. and now B has power from his left group]
;W[nm];B[je]LB[rj:A]C[



pmurphy:  At this point I was really starting to worry about the upper-right..but what to do?  I think I read somewhere the right place to invade is somewhere around N17 but I wasn't sure where to go with that.


djna: too late! you should not be able to live with N 17 now. 

Best you can reasonably hope for are reducing moves around M14. But the danger is that you get chased into B';s left wall.

The tricky thing about this though is that the bottom left B group is unstable, it can live or be killed.

So in fact the game is still just about playable playable for W. But it requries a careful evaluation. We note that Black A is huge, if W kills the bottom left, then B surely gets A

first note that B still has growth opportunities at the top and on the left. W has no real growth chance except he can get 20 points by killing B in the bottom left.

So W needs to find a way to reduce the upper right enough in sente and then play the endgame really well.]

What response did you expect to 1? Surely 2 is obvious? YOu just asked B to complete his territory.
