;B[pc];W[dp];B[qq];W[dd];B[qe];W[dj];B[fc]C[White 8: A pince
r by white seems incorrect here. Black has strength in the upper right, so white should play away; b seems nice. See future comments...]

(;W[hc]C[Black 9: A play at b, for example, reduces the moyo potential of white's san-ren-sei. A play at c ledas to a fight that seems favorable for black to the the strength in the upper right. In short, the pincer at 8 seems unreasonable for white.]

(;B[cc]TR[hc]C[Black 9: Perhaps white knew that black would invade at the 3-3 point (using psychological intuition), so that makes the pincer OK, since black chooses to play into white's desires. The san-ren-sei will work as planned for a nice moyo. Eve
n so, the marked stone may yet present a porblem, as it may get isolated.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bc]C[White 14: white is trying to play joseki by rote and has mis-remembered. White needs to play at b.]

(;W[bd]C[Black 15: Black should move out to take advantage of white's mistake. Black can do this because of the 13-14 exchange. Black would gain a tremendous advantage.]

(;B[fb]C[White 16: A play at b is joseki and is more solid. Even so, black has once again allowed white to miss bad outcomes of poor moves.]

(;W[ge]C[Black 17: White's moyo is bigger than black's. Black should choose to reduce/invade white's moyo rather than attempt to build up black's own. Besides, it is difficult to build a moyo from a 3-3 stone. b,c,d,e,f all seem like good moves, for examp
le.]
(;B[pn];W[jp]C[White 18: Nice. White expands the potential of the san-ren-sei moyo.

Black 19: This cut may be premature. But maybe not. It is certainly a big move. But the danger is that white will abandon the triangled stone and just further build the large white moyo. Black's upper-side moyo will be easy to redue later, as the diamonde
d stone is low (instead of at X). However, all of this is moot, as black's tactics are flawed, despite a reasonable strategy of cutting. Black 19 needs to be at b.]

(;B[hd]TR[hc]MA[pe][gd];W[gd]TR[hd]MA[pj]C[Black 21: Black is about to make an empty triangle. This is terrible shape. This illustrates the poor tactical placement of black 19.]
;B[gc]C[WHite 22: Rather than waste time with a non-threatening ladder
-break, white should play at b. Black will have tactical difficulties on the upper side.]

(;W[pl];B[id]C[Black 23: Good. Resolves the upper side uncertainty.

White 24: But Black has ended in gote. White should expand white's moyo.  b,c, and maybe d seem ideal. Black's moyo potential is smaller than white, so white should not be spending time now reducing it.]

(;W[qh];B[cn]C[Black 25: Good. Black beats white to the critical area of the board.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[fp]C[Black 29: This move is not really joseki. It helps white too much. b and c are more common. I recommend c.]

;B[bm];W[ao];B[em];W[fl]C[White 42: Black chose to live small rather than escape to the center. This is a terrible result for black. White has maximized the potential of white's moyo. Furthermore, black is not alive yet. The situation is very tricky.  Bla
ck is going to need to push towards the center to live. Check out some of the variations.]

(;B[bh]C[Black 43: A terrible mistake. Black needs to live. Save the clamp aji for later. It does nothing now other than to increase black's problems.]
;W[ai];B[ci];W[ch];B[di];W[bg];B[ei]C[White 50: b is correct shape. But white should play c first to sta
rt the ko.]
(;W[ek];B[aj];W[ah]C[Black 53: The ko is now critical. Black needs to live or run. The three black stones must be recognized as the products of a mistake that must now be abandoned.]
;B[gi]TR[ek]MA[fj]C[White 54: White should probably play at c, threatening the ko at  b. Note how white regrets not having played the marked stone at X.]

(;W[fh]TR[cj][dj][dk][ek][el][fl][fm]C[Black 55: Recognizing the need to live is good. But first black should probably play out at b, reducing the liberties of the marked white stones and leaving some aji for later.]

(;B[dm];W[fi];B[og]MA[qj][lp][hq][hp][cq]C[Black 57: Too vague. White can easily enter the top moyo, perhaps beginning with b or c. Any of the points marked X might be better choices for 57.]

(;W[qn];B[qo];W[qm];B[jg]MA[pb][jd][pf][lg]C[Black 61: Bold. Perhaps necessary, since white seems to be ahead.  Nevertheless the moyo seems a little weak, for example, at all of the points marked X.]
;W[po]TR[pn]C[Black 63: Since black chose to tenuki, bla
ck has no choice now but to play at b. The aji of the marked stone should be saved.]

(;B[pp];W[oo];B[op];W[ro]C[Black 67: Has to be at b. This move is too important to be missed at this level of play.]

(;B[no];W[qp]C[Black 69: b would be standard kikashi in this situation. Black's mistake at 67 may have erased black's last hope of winning, however.]

(;B[lp];W[rq];B[hp];W[jn];B[hn];W[jl]C[Black 75: As the furute of the game will show, this is an area of white strength. Black may be best just to cross under here.]

(;B[hq]C[White 76: Locally, b seems better than a.]
(;W[eq];B[fm];W[hl]C[Black 79: b is probably bigger.]
(;B[lc]C[White 80: a no longer seems like the best idea. It seems small. Maybe start with a probe at b,c, or d]

(;W[pf]
(;B[pe];W[of]C[Black 83: May be better at b.]
(;B[pg]C[White 84: I think this is better at b.]
(;W[qg];B[qf];W[oi];B[ng]TR[lp][no][op][pp][qq]C[White 88: Good. Black will have a problem saving both sets of marked stones.]
;W[kq];B[hm]TR[no][op][pp][qq][lp]C[White 90: White b seems to kill or at least seriously maim the marked black group.  The actual move serves no purpose. The center is just dame.]

(;W[im];B[lq]C[White 92: b is more severe.]
(;W[pq]C[Jared: My comments end here. White hangs onto white's lead in the endgame and wins by 4.5 points in this no-komi game.]
