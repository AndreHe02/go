GV:
Hello, I am Gabriel, this was a tournament game I lost even I had a feeling I was leading until few mistakes. I've played for B. My comments will be marked as GV. Thank you in advance for review.

B was leading until midlegame so seems I played yose badly. but I was not very aware where did W reached the points at the end..

Chew: Honestly, losing M2 lost you the game.  However, you did fairly well up until then.  I'll try to point out a few suggestions prior to that, though.

Chew: I've played through the game a few times, and have some thoughts.  Basically, you made very good strategic, large-board decisions all game.  However, you gradually lost points once the fighting started.  You lost points in the bottom right, the bottom left, the middle, and at M2.  These sorts of fights, you will improve with practice.  Be careful of giving your opponent ponnukis (they often help him connect his stones, buying him safety), and keep an eye out for your own weaknesses.  In the bottom right and near M2, your stones were able to be put into atari, so your opponent took advantage of your weakness before you could defend it.  With a little more practice to sharpen your fighting insticts, I expect you will improve!]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[qf];B[nd];W[pj];B[ci]C[This all seems fairly reasonable, so far.]
;W[lc]
(;B[mc]C[Generally, kicking will strengthen your opponent's stone, unless you already have a close pincer in place.  Assume that they will make an iron pillar (M16 here), and only play this 'kick' if that shape is preferable.  I prefer either P13 or K17.]
;W[ld];B[hc]C[Good, though it could be one closer.];W[ic];B[hd]
;W[oc]C[GV: I did not see the weakness W've just expolited

Chew: The 'exploitation' was reasonable, but too early.  W should have waited until M17 was safer.  There is a chancee that he will end up running short of liberties on M17, if you split and fight.]
;B[pc];W[mb];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb]C[Be careful letting your opponent get a free ponnuki.  Play N16 to keep the pressure on.]
;W[md];B[od];W[rd]C[GV: W's nice and sucessful invasion :(

Chew: As I said, if you want to fight, split the invasion off, rather than letting it connect.  As such, you're still okay in the corner, and he's still not quitealive on top.]
;B[rc];W[re];B[jp]C[Your opponent is not yet alive  on the top.  Every instinct screams 'Attack!'  K15 would both cause pressure and build your framework on the left.]

C[GV:
I think opening is over ..
Chew: This move is perfect.  It makes your group strong, between two weak groups.  I think you are ahead, if only because of these weak groups.]
;W[dl];B[dk];W[ck];B[cj]C[Chew: B9 might be easier, here.  Not positive it's better, but it's my instict.]
;W[bk];B[bl];W[ek];B[dj];W[el];B[fi];W[bm];B[bj];W[bo];B[bp]
;W[cq];B[bq]TR[dq]C[GV: maybe D3 would be better, I've just tried

Chew: I think C4 may be best.  Sometimes, simple is worth it.  That would leave B5 in danger.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[cr];B[dr];W[do];B[gg];W[ff];B[gf];W[lp];B[kq]
;W[lq];B[qn];W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[po]C[This move has to defend.  You have four cutting points, and can't easily defend them all.]
;B[qq];W[rn];B[rm];W[qm];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr]C[GV: now I see - too slow :(

Chew: I agree.  Either fight the ko with T6, or play somewhere else.]
;W[kj];B[og];W[ph];B[pg];W[qg];B[kn];W[lm];B[ln];W[mn];B[mg]
TR[fn][gn][go]SQ[qb]C[GV: Maybe the marked places wemo more effective, just I was affraid that the Q17 B group is not yet alive

Chew: I think you're entirely alive there.  However, if you're not sure, you picked the best move.  It moves out while buying eyespace.  Since I think you're alive though, I prefer something like T6 or G5.]
;W[kg];B[nj]C[Aggressive.  I like the fighting spirit.];W[ni]
;B[mi];W[mj];B[lj]C[I would be tempted to play P11, to connect to your group above.]
;W[mk];B[lk];W[oi];B[ml]C[You squeeze this group well, gaining a reasonable reduction.]
;W[nk];B[nl];W[ok];B[kl];W[mm];B[ll];W[li];B[ki]C[Probably simplest to just connect.  That would cut off the central white stones.  Be careful giving those ponnukis.]

(;B[il]C[GV: this was a big mistake :( seems I've miscalculated. After this bad move it is more or less over.
anyway seems W is leading  few points so I played somewhere slow. but I was not very aware where did W reach the points.

Chew: Yeah, this has to defend around J3.  Captiring K8 is small compared to losing M2.]
