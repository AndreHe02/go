C[FM: Hello, my name is Martin and my comments will begin with "FM:" as my nick everywhere is Field Mouse]
;B[qd];W[dq];B[dd];W[qp];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fq]
;B[dj];W[oc];B[jc]C[FM: this pincer is not necesarilly bad but it gives white a lot of shape to build a base on the upper side. I would prefer it to be closer to the white stone]
;W[lc]LB[fc:A][qf:B]C[FM: natural. White is aiming at A and B now]
;B[pc];W[od]
(;B[pe]LB[le:C][oe:B][nf:A]
(;W[nf]LB[fc:C][pg:B][oq:A]TR[jc]C[FM: I prefer this move. Now white has a nice continuation at B and can aim at C. The marked stone is now clearly not in a good position now.]

(;B[oq]C[FM: this part of the board is small];W[po]LB[fc:A]
TR[co][cp][dq][fq]C[FM: good move. White wants to keep black on the lower side which is small because of the marked group. Ignoring and playing at A is also good]
;B[lq]LB[pg:A]C[FM: ignoring and playing at A was still better]

(;W[qk]C[FM: too close]
(;B[qi]LB[qg:A]C[FM: playing here is not so big anymore. Also there is still a hole in blacks position]

(;W[ok]C[FM: again this is too slow.]
(;B[hq]LB[er:A]C[FM: very small. Black is probably aiming at the A thing but that is not even sente and it is small right now]

(;W[fc]C[this move looks logical for me... but after that, black had a good game attacking white and making points on the left side. is there a better idea ???
(LL)


FM: yes, this area was very important. And this move is okay]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[hd]
(;W[ff];B[df]LB[ge:A][fh:B]C[FM: if black got to play this move then white got a bit tricked here]

(;W[ge]LB[df:B][ff:A]C[perhaps a mistale ?

FM: this move is very strange. If white wanted to play this move then the A-B exchange should never be played]

(;B[je]
(;W[if]C[FM: this move does not do much...];B[jf]C[FM:... it just forced black to play this good move]
;W[ig]
(;B[fb]C[FM: not good. Black does not know if the middle group will need the side eye space or not.]

(;W[of]LB[og:A][kh:C][nh:B]C[FM: this move is too slow. Locally A or B are better. But the correct direction is playing around C.]

(;B[mh]C[a good move !
(LL)

FM: this move is slow. It tries to attack white but white is already quite thick]

(;W[pj]C[FM: I do not get this move. White seems to wat to stay connected but this move does not really do anything else than connecting]

(;W[oi]LB[ph:C][oi:B][pj:A]C[slow : is it necessary ??
(LL)

FM: this is very painful. White lost sente with the ABC exchange and black protected his weak stone. White stone at A should be somewhere else]

(;W[fm]LB[fo:A]C[FM: if white did not want to continue from the A move with some invasion then A was almost a pass]

is there an opportunity to create some aji ???

FM: white played a lot of slow moves in this game, many times forcing black to defend his weaknesses. Unfortunately white did not manage to build enough territory and was not able to compete with points. Next time I would recommend white to try to attack a bit more - as long as the fight is harder for the opponent it is good to start it.]
