C[s: hi! all my comments will be preceded by an s:

as requested, i'll review for the W side, but will point out some notable B moves too.

hope my advice helps.];B[pd]C[Okay this is a game between me and a friend I Thank you for the review

s: my pleasure.];W[dp];B[pq]C[s: at this point, W can choose to prevent B from playing the chinese opening, or allow him to do so. it is worth considering, more so when you get to single-digit kyu.

if you don't know what the chinese opening is, you can search sensei's library for it. just google for sensei's library. it's been a helpful resource for me.]
;W[dd];B[qk]C[s: lo and behold, the chinese opening. i didn't look ahead in this game, by the way.

although at double-digit kyu level, i believe that learning to play in good shape and fighting well is more important than a good opening.]
;W[dj]C[I played sanrensei against his low chines

s: whoops. looks like you know what you're doing, haha.];B[jd]
;W[qc]C[s: this leads to a bad exchange for W, in my opinion.

if B forms a wall facing the bottom, he has a huge moyo and W is sealed in.]
;B[qd]C[s: B does make the wall facing south.];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd]
LB[ob:a]C[s: this deviation from joseki is covered slightly at the bottom of this website.

http://senseis.xmp.net/?44Point33InvasionJoseki

joseki was at A];B[re];W[ob]LB[rc:a]C[s: W must protect at A.

i show some variations in from here where B responds with A, which i think is good.]
(;B[nc]
(;W[mb]C[this was a misclick

s: this loses the corner.];B[nb]C[s: correct reply];W[na]LB[pa:a]
C[s: W should have played A to protect the corner.

B can kill the corner now. i show some variations.]
(;B[fc];W[lb]C[s: not a useful move.

this doesn't save the corner or gain much territory.];B[jb]
;W[ec]C[s: in general, don't play this move against the F17 approach. the corner is still invadable, and B gets stronger.]
;B[fd];W[ef]C[s: 3-3 point in UL is invadable now. i show some variations.]
(;B[rc];W[rb];B[sd];W[pb]C[s: necessary.

but corner is not totally alive yet. variation shows why.]
(;B[pn];W[nq]LB[jq:a][kq:b]C[s: too close to B's strength.

A or B are more reasonable.];B[lq]C[his pincer here i did no know how to properly handle it if you could give me an idea of how i would like that.

s: here are 3 options. the first is the least preferable, the last is the most preferable. variations show each of these.

1) run into the center, giving B an attack on your weak group.
2) try and create some aji with 3-3 and starting a fight to try to live.
3) counter-pincer and treat O3 lightly(as a stone easily sacrificed)]
(;W[no]C[1) running away. i shall show a variation here.]
(;B[iq]
(;W[lo]C[s: this is fine running, but running was the worst choice.]
;B[fq];W[eq]C[s: again, try not to play this against the knight's move approach to 4-4.]
;B[dn];W[cn];B[dm]
(;W[cl]C[was also a misclick];B[nm];W[cm];B[do];W[co];B[ep]
;W[cq]LB[dq:a][er:b]C[s: A is better shape, since it doesn't allow B to atari at B.]
;B[fp]LB[fo:a][eo:b][fr:c][gq:d]C[s: ironically, here A is better shape, since it better protects the cut at B and makes better eyeshape. there is no stone at C to threaten the atari at D.]
;W[lm]C[48-86 i tried to live if there is a better way to live i dont know but if you do please show me.]
;B[mk]
(;W[ml]LB[nl:a]C[s: this move hurts your chances of living. A is better. backtrack to see variation. i show a variation to living.]
;B[nl];W[lk];B[mj];W[lj];B[mi];W[on]C[again, this kosumi(diagonal move) to contact is usually to be avoided. it doesn't make shape. better to cut across the knights move.]
;B[om];W[po];B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr];W[mq];B[kl];W[km]
;B[ll];W[mm];B[jl]LB[nn:a]C[s: A now immediately lives. no need to give B that big wall like in the game.]
;W[jm];B[im];W[in];B[hm];W[hn];B[gn];W[nn];B[ho];W[io];B[hp]
;W[jp];B[jq];W[kp];B[kq];W[lp];B[ip];W[jo];B[ki]C[s: this is a big loss for W. it started with holding on to that weak O3 stone, turning it into a weak O3 group, and having it attacked while B gained strength all around, including a ton of territory on the right.]
;W[gj]C[s: in a game where you're far behind, the best strategy in such dire circumstances is usually to look for a group to kill or some unreasonable area to invade.

you can try to kill the top left 4 stones on a large scale. you can try to invade and live on the right side. you can try to kill the top right.

other more reasonable strategies do not work in such unreasonable circumstances.]
;B[ij];W[hh];B[jg];W[jh]C[s: not useful.];B[kh];W[ji]C[s: not useful]
;B[jj];W[ii]C[s: again, not useful. let B capture if he wants. it's small.]
;B[qn];W[hj];B[hk]
(;W[gk]C[too slow i think some thing like my alternative move would have been better.

s: either way is not appropriate if W is trying to win. W is too far behind to play reasonable moves.]

[qs][rs][ss]C[and this is end game anything you can give me as fare as my questions will be greatly appreciated thank you =D

s: overall, you played fine. try to avoid misclicking by placing your cursor away from the board when it's not your turn. it helps me for that.

play away from strength (O3).

consider sacrificing weak stones instead of turning them into weak groups.

play contact moves to make shape when trying to live. but in general, don't play kosumi to contact.

either try to get a visual feel for when you're behind, or count. when you're far behind, try to kill something or try to live in an unreasonable area.

hope it helps. you can ask any follow up questions or send me further games for review directly if you like. siowyisheng@gmail.com.]

(;W[if];B[ig];W[hg];B[jf];W[ie];B[id];W[ge]C[so yeah i think this is better alot better am not sure tough.]
))
(;W[nl]C[play sente moves to make shape. cutting across a knight's jump is a common way of making shape. these moves are usually contact plays.]
;B[ml];W[mm]LB[nn:a]C[we wanted to get this move, which makes some shape for our stones. it threatens A, which would make superb shape for our stones and with an atari.]
;B[nn]C[B must play here to prevent W from doing so.];W[lp]
LB[mq:a]C[here is another contact move that threatens a followup at A to again make good shape.]
;B[mq];W[kq]C[now hane to put B's two stones in danger.];B[kr]
;W[jq];B[jr];W[jo]C[now we have a mouth shape.];B[jp];W[ip]
C[in this variation we trade the mouth shape for some other shape. it could easily be better to just extend from the atari. this is just an example.]
;B[kp];W[io]C[now we have some other decent shape. W is looking good here already.]
;B[mn]C[B tries to cut W's shape apart.];W[ln]C[keep your important stones connected.]
;B[mo];W[il]C[sacrifice your unimportant stones.

there is a nice analogy here. when you are running, you don't want to be carrying a heavy backpack, because then you can't run fast. you want to throw away your heavy things, and then you can run easily.

often this will mean sacrificing your tail end when running. 

now this move defends the cut and peep, makes some eyespace, and brings the group closer to safety at the left.

W is safe now.];B[ko]C[if B tries to poke at W's shape...];W[kn]

(;W[gq]C[to keep him from getting to much on the bottom i think would have been better would also like some comment on that.

s: strengthening your running group is better, to prevent it from being attacked. having a weak group be attacked and have to run is one of the ways to quickly lose a game.

i show a variation of B attacking.];B[lo];W[nm];B[lm];W[nk]
