C[mini2 [2k\]: hi there

sigue [2k\]: howdy



sigue is requesting the review.  I think we both played okay, but I do see a lot of places I would play differently.  I'm particularly interested in analysis of the early parts of the game and of my attempts to reduce white's big moyo on top.  Thanks.

[no:B][qq:A]C[sigue [2k\]: not sure best way to respond to this.  i played at A but B and C seem reasonable also. Is R5 compatible with D4 and R16?



I think I prefer B (see variation).]
(;B[qq]LB[jq:B][lq:A]C[janr: probably; this move is ok.
We would like R5 to be at Q5 (which is more usual after a 3-3 opening at R3 and a kakari at P3), but R5 seems solid and allows black to tenuki, leaving black with a strong and secure corner and a possibility to attack white later (at B after white A)]
;W[lq];B[jq]TR[oc][cf]C[janr: of course, there is no need to attack immediately as the triangled points are also big.]
;W[oo];B[pm]
(;W[qh]C[janr: yes, the problem with blacks attack may be that white plays tenuki, leaving black with the problem of making profit out of his attack.  

Still, if white does tenuki (not recommended at this point), I would prefer A, in order to avoid a black moyo on the bottom/left]

(;B[qj]LB[oe:C][qf:B][jo:A]C[janr: this is not the most urgent point, nor is it the correct direction I think.

Two options for black are attacking at A, punishing the tenuki, or splitting the white stones, e.g. at B or C (I'm not sure about the best local move)]
;W[pf]C[janr: to me, the connection of the white stones looks painful for black.]

(;B[oc]LB[jc:A]C[See variation.  I think I prefer to play at A.  Later white gets too big of a moyo on top and even if I play at A I can still live in the corner, and A helps to negate the power of the white wall.]

(;W[nc]C[janr: Maybe white can be more aggressive.];B[pc];W[nd]

(;B[rf]LB[re:A][rf:B]C[This move is not necessary.
White can only play A or B as forcing moves.];W[gc]LB[hd:B]

janr: A is ok I think]
(;B[dj];W[fq]
(;B[fo]LB[jo:B][eq:A]C[janr: this move seems to let white live easily.  I prefer A or B]
;W[hq]LB[hd:B][ip:A]C[I think this is a similar situation as before.  I need to choose between spending another move to make a weak group stronger (i.e., R16 and K3) vs reducing white's moyo.  Maybe the right way to put it is that H16 is urgent while playing around K5 is not.

janr: Splitting white in two groups seems urgent. Unfortunaterly; F5 does not attack white severely.]

Often it is better to place a stone in the middle, which can escape to different directions.  One can then wait to see how to opponent reacts.]

janr: whites ponuki and the attack on blacks k17 stone seem very powerful.  If white tries to live in the corner, he should do so making white less strong I think.
In the end, playing tenuki after A allows black the option of taking the corner, but he may not want to do so as the result would be that he has invested four more stones than white in that area and may be overconcentrated.]
