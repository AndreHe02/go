AB[pd][dp]C[Alex: It's hard to pick out any sort of systematic or strategic error that you're making from this game - you lost more from a number of tactical blunders than any wrong thinking. That said, if I had to pick out a problem with your game, it would be that you let yourself get pushed around too easily. This is only a two stone handicap, remember, not four, or six, or nine... your opponent isn't that much stronger than you, so you don't need to fear him very much.

On the other hand, the point at which you actually lose the game is when you're trying a bit too hard to kill, rather than defending your own weakness first.  You still would have pulled it off except for a tactical error, but it was attacking before defending that opened the possibility for making that kind of blunder.

Overall, I think you need to get better at assessing the relative strength and weakness of your groups and your opponent's. If you've got one weak group against one, you should probably attack, and try to get stronger while attacking... but if he's got several weak groups and you've only got one (as was the case at the end of the game), the best way to avoid complications is to solidify your group first... since he has several weak groups, he can't defend them all, so once you have no weaknesses remaining, you'll get to attack at least one of them severely.

I play black and lose this fighting game.

Please let me know my weak points, bad moves, missed opportunities, and what I should work on to get better.  Please focus on the fuseki and early middle game.



Thanks,
Simon];W[pp]C[jhistoire [4k\]: Hello
abcde [2k\]: hi];B[dd];W[cf];B[fd];W[dj];B[cm]C[Alex: So far, so good.]
;W[bd];B[cc]LB[ef:A][ch:B]TR[bd]C[Alex: This exchange is a mistake for White if he doesn't plan on defending at A immediately, since it loses him the option of making a base in the corner.

You should be looking to invade at B quite soon.];W[nc]
(;B[kc]LB[jc:A]C[Alex: I would hold back one line, at A. See variation.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc]C[J17 better to keep upper left strong?

Alex: No, I think you need to play here, but White's invasion shows why L17 should have been at K17 instead.]
;W[ic]LB[gc:B][ke:A]
(;B[ke];W[ie]C[This situation with multiple running games is confusing, what are the princinples to keep in mind?

Alex: Stay ahead, start attacking with knight's moves instead of one-space jumps as soon as your stones are stronger than the opponent's, don't let anything get sealed in.]
;B[kg];W[ng];B[ph];W[fb];B[eg]C[Alex: Good.];W[ec]
(;B[ed]TR[bd][fd][cf]C[Alex: This is too timid. Follow through with your threat and invade at C12 instead; if you can trade your one marked stone for the two marked White stones, you're getting a good deal.  See (crazy, extensive) variations.]
;W[dg];B[ig]C[Bad move?  I could not think of an effective way to attack the O17 group.

Alex: It seems natural to me, though now that White has F18 and E17, it's harder to kill these stones.]
;W[jf];B[kf];W[jg];B[jh];W[ih];B[hg];W[ii]
(;B[lh]C[Alex: Solid connection is probably better. This makes an empty triangle.]
;W[ji];B[kh];W[jd];B[kd];W[jb]C[Alex: I think you should respond to this; letting White connect his groups would be painful. Even if you have to trade the upper left for the upper right, you're not doing too badly since there's definitely more aji in your stones than his... but I actually don't think White can kill your upper left cleanly.]

(;B[gi];W[il];B[ni]LB[kb:B][nh:A]C[Alex: A is better than this, and blocking at B is even better.]

;B[fk];W[el];B[ek];W[dk];B[fl];W[dm];B[em];W[dl];B[fn]C[Alex: So you get out, but at a price. Living locally in the top left would have been better.]
;W[en];B[fm];W[cn];B[eo]C[Alex: This is important, but N18 is bigger. White's stones in the centre are weak enough that your group isn't in much danger.]
;W[jp]LB[mb:B][pn:A]
(;B[pn]C[Alex: N18 is clearly bigger than this. I think L18 kills too, with more territory, but N18 is safer and still enough for a pretty easy win.]
;W[ql]
(;B[qn]LB[om:A][rn:C][qq:B]C[Can you suggest something better?

Alex: Since the corner is still invadable, A and B are sort of miai and you could probably tenuki to kill the top group.

Locally, I think you have the right idea to split this stone from the corner, but either A or C accomplishes the same purpose, in better shape. See variations.]

(;B[pj]TR[mm][nm]C[Alex: Your knight's connection at the triangled points is weak. N18 is still available, so I'd defend your cutting point and make miai of killing these or the top right. See variation.]
