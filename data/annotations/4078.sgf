C[To whomever has the misfortune of plowing through this mess:

Well, I hope this game isn't that bad. This is a game I played for the Western Go Ladder's Round 11. Both of us are in Tier 10, if you find that helpful at all. We went at this game with our all.

This game was a wild ride. In the beginning, I though I had the advantage, because my opponent misplayed a joseki in the bottom left corner. However, he turned around and attacked... and attacked. I believe that most of the middle game involved me fighting for life. I swear I should have lost those battles, and that he could have killed me easily. I can't understand why he didn't. Did he see something I couldn't? Was he rushing because he was low on time? I don't know, and I'd like to.

With that said, I'd also like comments made on any slack, dumb, and even not-as-big moves I made. I'd also like help on whole-board analysis after each major sequence to help train my eye for reading the board.

On top of that, I am going to send this review to my opponent (I would have included his E-mail if I knew it, but the only way I can contact him is through the Western Go Ladder website). If you can comment on Black's moves as well as White's, we would both appreciate it.

Thank you!

Sincerely,
Joseph

C[dr: w may want to split at R10 to minimize b extension from shimari]

(;W[fc]C[dr: See thread for one common joseki here.  I think this w move makes b too good]

(;B[fd]C[dr: thread may be better line for b];W[gc];B[gd];W[hc]
C[Did I play this sequence properly? I feel as though I was squashed too low, but I didn't see how I could rise from the third line.

dr: See first thread];B[cj];W[cl];B[ej];W[el]C[I didn't enjoy helping him like this, but I couldn't shake the feeling that this was benefiting me. Please enlighten me.

dr: Game is about equal now];B[iq];W[kq];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[en]
;B[pj]C[dr: so b gets the big extension from shimari];W[qn]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[oo]C[Here, I had another funny feeling... I felt that Black had made a mistake, but I couldn't see it. What's the truth?

dr: The corner is very open.  B will need another move to protect it once w stones are secure]
;W[pl];B[ro];W[nm];B[mo]
(;W[ko]LB[lp:A]C[dr: The peep at A is intereswting for b. thread prevents that]

;W[kr]LB[kp:1][lq:2][kr:5][lr:3][mr:4]C[When I originally read this sequence, I missed that I lost the O3 stone, even though I read the same moves that were played. Go figure. Were these the wrong moves to play?

dr: This is good.  Keep b split];B[mq]
(;W[hp]C[dr: see alternative, w makes secure connection and then can attack strongly]
;B[ho];W[go];B[hl]
(;W[ip]LB[jc:G][mc:B][fg:E][qh:A][di:D][rj:H][gk:C][ln:F]C[Should I have connected at M6 now?

dr: L8 is a nice way to connect.
A-E then are big moves for w
Cut at F, then G, H for b
See the suggested sequence];B[ln];W[km];B[kn];W[jn];B[jm];W[mn]
;B[lo];W[jo];B[ml];W[nk];B[mm];W[mk];B[kl];W[nl];B[ll]C[dr: The problem for w now is to save Q8 group without giving b the upper right quadrant or a huge center.  My ideas dont look very good]

(;W[ph]C[I thought that playing here would help me make life by attacking around the stone at Q10, because I was looking at the tsuke at R10...]
;B[oi]
(;W[oh];B[ni];W[mg];B[li]C[... but once this happened, I felt sure that I was doomed to die.

dr: The w stones are not really dead.  The have an eye sort of. see this thread.  The problem is to save them somewhat gracefully.]

(;W[qj];B[qk];W[pk]C[This was a desperate move. It looked to be my best chance, but I honestly didn't think it would work. Comments?

dr: Living is not that hard now - see thread];B[qi]
(;W[oj]C[I saw this and thought, "Ooh! An eye!" I still thought I was fighting a dead-end battle, though, because I was afraid Black would play P7 and finish me.

dr: P7 doesnt do much]
(;B[pi];W[ql];B[kg]C[I was surprised to see him leave. Was I really settled on the right?

Of course, I wasn't happy to see this move, either... it felt like a slap to the face. I figured he was aiming for a kikashi, and then was going to return to the right and slay me.

dr: The real problem for w now is how to keep these three stones alive]
;W[ie]C[dr: big reducing move];B[ke];W[lc]C[This move was my desperation embodied. I just KNOW this shouldn't have worked...

dr:  yes may be able to trap these stones.  see thread];W[bk]

However, I intend to make use of that desire to have played better; that's why I'm sending this in to be reviewed. I look forward to your wisdom.

Again, thank you!

dr: At the mid kyu levels there are always going to be lots of mistakes.  Dont feel bad about it, just try to get a better grasp of the whole board.]
