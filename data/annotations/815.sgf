;B[go]C[E3 makes excellent shape for W... best to play E3 here.]
;W[eq];B[fn]C[I want to make a large moyo and develop
thickness on the outside.

Better to play E3 for D3 before pushing up at G5 then.];W[en]
;B[eo]C[This move is unnecessary.. just hane at E7.];W[ep];B[em]
;W[do];B[fm];W[gq];B[hq];W[fr];B[hr];W[dm]C[Give white territory in the corner and on the left side in exchange for a big
wall facing my stones on the right.];B[dl];W[cl];B[cm];W[dn]
;B[ck];W[bl];B[dk];W[bm];B[qp]C[Protect the corner.

With so much thickness, I would play K15 or so.  Let W invade the corner and live small, then you get whole middle.]
;W[nc];B[ne]C[Continue to build a large moyo.];W[qf];B[ph];W[rd]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[je]C[Should I attack white's invation more strongly?

Yes... w lives too easily.  The value of thick wall is not to make territory, but to use for attack.  Shoud make w run out into your wall... I think Q12 is too loose.]

(;C[See variation for better way to seal w here.];B[qh]C[This move allows w to move out on the right...]
;W[ri];B[qj];W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc]C[White lives with about 15 points in exchange for solidifying my
power in the center.

BUT w lives in sente.... w should only get gote life here.]
;W[gc]C[This is bad move for w... urgent to start reducing center for w]

;B[dh];W[mq]C[What to do here?  Let white live small on the edge.

Need to count... w has maybe 85 points... if he lives small on the edge, do you have enough in the center?    I think more than enough!]

;B[is];W[mr];B[ps]C[This move very small at this stage and gote.]

;W[rm]C[This is overplay for w... he should be killed here]
;B[sj];W[sn];B[rk];W[ro];B[qn];W[qm];B[pm]C[Better at Q6.  You are so thick, you can let w run to center and die.]
;W[pl];B[pn];W[ql];B[ol]C[Again, no need to play so tight.  When chasing weak group, don't need to touch him.   Just reinforce at P10 and w will die.]
;W[pk];B[ok]C[Where is b weak?  Q10 much better here.  Don't be afraid to let w run to center.. you are so thick, he will die.]

C[Greedy?

Yep!  You are so far ahead, no need to take risk!];W[ej];B[bi]
C[This is dangerous and too greedy.  Just F9 good enough here.]
;W[el];B[aj];W[ek];B[bh]C[For endgame, A8 is bigger, as B6 comes later for black]
;W[gn]C[The start of my trouble.];B[gl]LB[gm:a]C[I think this was my losing
move.  If I can just hold the center I should win easily.  Would G7 (a) be better?

B is so thick, B is still OK here.];W[hn];B[io];W[in];B[jn]
;W[jm];B[il];W[kn];B[jo];W[hl];B[hm]LB[gk:a]C[Another bad move.  I think G9 (a) would
work.

This is very bad move.  G9 very safe and sure win.];W[im];B[gm]
;W[hk]C[Oops!  From here I should
perhaps resign but I decided to limit the damage and hope for the
best.

Not much more to comment on.  You built a huge, solid moyo, and with safe play had an easy win.]
