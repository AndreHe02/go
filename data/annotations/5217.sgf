C[<k>(Karczmarz) Hi, this was a game to the Iwamoto tournament, I`m white and I lost by 1.5.
I made many mistakes during the game concernig invasion/reducing moyo, my fuseki was not that good too I think.
If you could direct me to better way of playing it I would appreciate it.
Thanks in advance.

<s>(sestir) That is a good summary. Review for white ...];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp]LB[qn:C][pp:B][pq:A]C[<k> Here I didn`t know the best move.
I thought about O17, but the left side was too big to leave it like this.
I was searching for the move that would work best with komoku and two stones in the LL corner and I played this...

<s> I do not know the best move either but black's opening is very similar to the Kobayashi Opening. The only difference is that here, black's A (Q3) is at B (Q4).

Another black move on the right side would make a kind of long-moyo that is very hard to invade for a simple reason. If you invade one part of it, the other part will become territory.

So, you would normally play your next move on the right side, for example at C (R6).]
;W[ci]C[<s> This move is big but you have to know how you are going to deal with black's moyo.]

<k> I think I should settle my group with L18-17, but that leaves black occasion to attack my UL corner and destroying my teritory, so I attacked him first...

<s> Jump out before living is important now because A (O13) is a pivotal point, on the boundary between white's and black's sphere of influence.

The upper left corner is not attackable, as black does not have any stones nearby. D17 can a) enclose the corner b) extend along the upper side c) extend along the lower side d) run into the centre and e) connect to C11.

Maybe you mean 'approach my UL corner'. Approaching an unfinished corner is big but not half as big as O13.]

<s> It should be obvious that black is trying to grab the whole centre here. N13/M12 is big.

Another observation is that eyes are not usually efficient shape. That is, if you have to make eyes, you will have to make empty triangles and play moves inside your own territory in order to divide it in two.

Your opponent will get several moves on the outside that either takes influence, territory or nothing. White does not want to play on the inside here.]

(;W[kd]C[<s> And this is pushing from behind because white decided in his mind that he wanted his eyes here and now. It gives black good shape because he can play two hanes.]
;B[kf];W[kc];B[mg];W[lf];B[lg]C[<k> This result is not what I`ve wished for, this black wall is big.
I never know what to do in such positions, how to attack this moyo, I can`t just reduce it pasively, because black will get too much teritory.

<s> White is about 25 points behind so all he can do is to start a fight as far away from the wall as possible, and hope for a black mistake.]

;W[jj];B[jc];W[kg]C[<k> Is this cut makes any sense?? I thought it does, but afterwards I ended up with a weak group in black moyo.

<s> It seems it does not work. But it still ended up a success because you lived without giving up too much.]

<s> I think both black and white played a good yose.

<k> Thanks for reviewing this game, I hope you can help me improving a bit. I`m looking forward to this.

<s> If you are ahead of your opponent when running into the centre, you will be able to connect your groups and your opponent will be split. The one who is split will be busy making eyes. The one who is connected will be busy with riping the profits and writing autographs. =)

This was an interesting game to review. I hope I have helped you understand some more of the strategies.]
