C[I was W. made some comments on my own on this file. many thanks for commenting! philip

[NM\] Hi Philip, I will comment your game for you.

After a quick look through the game, it looks like you were winning by 20 points in the endgame. Some reading mistakes or lack of concentration and you lost a lot of points.

I think to improve, study about what moves are urgent.
Is there a weak group on the board? try settle it quickly.

Have a plan, every move is a new position. Take a big point if you have sente. Dont follow your opponents moves if you dont realy need to and you will be stronger.

Of course, lots of life and death problems too :)

regards,
Neil];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[dh];B[dd]C[this move is obviously not the standard move to expect,  but how to react?

[NM\] I think only two options C17 and E17, both good for white.]
;W[cc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc]C[[NM\] You can take sente, white is a alive in the corner.
B15 is ok];W[be];B[fb]C[[NM\] Take sente now. D19 is small]
;W[da];B[fe]C[is this fair for both sides?

[NM\] F15 is good shape but no need to play now. It gives you sente

[NM\] You have sente, I think slightly better for white];W[nq]
;B[qn];W[pr];B[qq];W[kp]C[[NM\] I expected L3 but this is ok too]
;B[pj]
(;W[kc]C[might not be the ideal invasion point. quite close to the strong B group on top left. and W invasion will lead to a very cramped position. where are other possible invasion points to reduce B position?

[NM\] You are right, stay away from thickness.

O17 would be a little better.

I like R17, but it depends on your play style.

An idea is to play O16 too, so not to get attacked so easily.]
;B[mc];W[hc]
(;B[ke]LB[ld:A]C[too hard? maybe better for B to play the variations?  leaves a hole at A

[NM\] This is the hardest move. It is a very good attacking move and probably correct here.]
;W[he]C[[NM\] ok, can make good shape];B[eh]C[[NM\] Black tries a leaning attack on H17 group? Good idea]
;W[cg];B[eg];W[ld];B[lf];W[md];B[nc];W[gb];B[fa];W[lb]LB[hg:A]
C[bad shape? better to jump out at A?

[NM\] I'm really not sure what is 'correct' for these last few moves.

I think the idea is to settle this white group very quickly.

A is pushing from behind.

M18 Shape is ok to settle quick];B[gc];W[hb];B[gd]C[[NM\] Black moves do nothing]
;W[if];B[jg];W[pe]C[[NM\] Q15 looks strange to me.

What were your reasons?

Is white alive? Probably ok];B[lc];W[kd];B[mb]C[[NM\] bad moves by black.

It strengthens white and even reduces O17 liberties :(];W[kb]
C[[NM\] I would mybe play P15 instead to keep connected];B[qd]
;W[mf]C[[NM\] good move];B[mg];W[je]C[[NM\] O14 instead

K15 helps make life, but allowing black O14 would be painfull]
;B[jf];W[nf]C[[NM\] black has been very kind these last few moves and has helped you settle the group]
;B[ig];W[hg];B[gf];W[hf];B[gg]C[[NM\] G13 almost a pass];W[hh]
;B[ji]C[[NM\] I think now, you need a plan.

All the groups look settled. 

Take a big point C6 or D3 are ideas. C3 also possible...];W[ph]
;B[mi];W[ei]C[[NM\] I dont think you can kill black.

E11 is a very good point but mybe too soon?]

;B[bn];W[cm];B[jo];W[ik]LB[jp:A][jo:B]C[blocking at A was thought as too passive. B is on 5th line, hence floating and no eye.

[NM\] K4 does seem passive. 

Im not sure if J9 is better though.

It seems your slightly ahead in territory.

I would play K4];B[jp]LB[jp:A]C[was it better for W to block at A? secure points?

[NM\] J9 says you want to attack K5];W[jq]C[[NM\] Playing K3 now says you want territory.

Hard to find a follow up to J9.

M6 mybe];B[iq];W[jr];B[ho];W[hq]C[[NM\] nice move];B[ir];W[hp]
;B[ko];W[ip]C[obviously a mistake. should be at A. Bs group has no eye yet, cutting here was not required.

[NM\] This cut is ok, it connects your two groups

You could play M4 instead];B[kq];W[lp]C[[NM\] needs to be L2]
;B[kr]LB[nq:A]C[Ws group at A is very weak now.];W[io]C[[NM\] Time to save weak group

N6 or O6];B[mr];W[mq];B[qr];W[lr];B[ls];W[mn];B[lq];W[km];B[lo]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[np];B[lp]C[[NM\] black pass];W[oo];B[jm];W[in]
;B[jn];W[kl];B[im];W[hm];B[jk];W[pm];B[ij];W[hk];B[hj];W[bm]
LB[gk:A]C[better at A?

[NM\] no B7 is ok

Although there is mybe sente moves for you, P16?

Also the O4 group is not alive , surrounded and has no eyes :(

;B[jl];W[fm];B[fl];W[el];B[lm];W[ml]C[[NM\] I think both black and white forgot about this group]
