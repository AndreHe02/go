;B[pd]C[MM: Thanks for the opportunity to make this review, requested by Black through the GTL. I have reached 7kyu in the AGA mostly through midgame fighting. I am not be the best player for strategic questions like "direction of play" or proper fuseki, but I will do my best. I talk a little bit about common joseki (http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm) because I have just begun to study them, so this game gives me an opportunity to study some more.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[dn];B[ip]
(;W[po]C[MM: White doesn't continue the joseki with E3, perhaps wisely (var.).]

(;B[iq]TR[nq][mq][np]C[Is this too passive?

MM: It seems too defensive.  White is not finishing the pincer joseki in the lower left, therefore Black should be able to gain a local advantage; but attacking so bluntly, while letting White have a double kakari on the right, is not the way. I think I like something in the area of N3-O4 better. The joseki response to Q5 is O3 or O4; together with your stones on the left, that could give you a lead that lets you coast to victory. (var.)]
;W[oq]TR[np]C[MM: Black should not let White have two moves against the corner like this; it can more than offset Black's gain to the left. But, I think this is the wrong way for White to attack. The natural result of a contact play like this is that both sides will get stronger.  Therefore White should attack from a distance instead - perhaps something like O4. I would probably try something like L2, threatening to connect under J3 (but my games tend to be too violent, and I tend lose due to obvious blunders, so take that with a grain of salt).]
;B[op];W[pp];B[nq];W[or];B[nr];W[pr];B[pj]TR[ce][de]C[MM: White about 20 points in the corner, Black gets about 25 points on the lower side and sente, and the lower left corner is still open. So, this seems ok for Black. Q10 looks reasonable, but maybe the corner approach at C15 or D15 would be better.]
;W[np]TR[ce][de][ci][nc][mc][md][nd][jc][jd][cf]C[MM: Seems small, though it does separate the bottom Blacks from the right side. Near C15, K16, or O17 would probably be better (triangles).]
;B[mp];W[no];B[lp]TR[mr]C[MM: Probably better to just connect at N3.  This M4 leaves an endgame reduction for White at O2.]
;W[nc];B[qg]C[this didnt seem like quite the right move but since it gave me good side framework and some influence i played it anyway..

MM: It's the right idea; R14 is the normal joseki move.];W[jd]
C[MM: A 3-space diagonal like this is not a secure connection.]
;B[lc]C[MM: I imagine you also considered M16. I can't tell which is better.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]TR[nc][lc]C[MM: This forces White to live on the right side, and there will still be potential in the O17 stone. It may be better to play R16, letting White have the corner so Black can have large territory on the right side, and still have potential in the M17 stone.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[pe]
(;B[nd]C[MM: I don't like this move. It looks fancy, but ultimately does not work, I think. It seems like almost any other move in this area would be better (vars.).]
;W[oc];B[od];W[nb];B[pf];W[re];B[qf]TR[nd]C[MM: White gets about 14 points in the corner, and probably can connect to the K16 stone for a huge upper side, and later has a monkey-jump reduction on the right.  This seems bad for Black. I blame the move at O16, which gave White too many forcing moves.]
;W[ql]TR[qb]C[MM: This is premature. White needs to capture at P19, or otherwise protect the cutting point at R18.]
;B[rf];W[rc];B[se];W[rb];B[rk]TR[ce][de][gd]C[MM: Good instinct - you don't like White to be lower than you on the side. But you should save this for later, probably. Your group is alive for now, so look for the bigger plays like C15 or D15, or maybe something like G16.]
;W[ol]TR[ci][de][ce][ld][md][fm]C[MM: I don't know why White does this. It looks like only 3 or 4 points, and it is not sente. I guess it does aim at the center somewhat, but something like F7 seems to do that better. If White instead plays something C11, or C15, or M16, then Black's game seems very difficult.]
;B[de]C[MM: GOOD!];W[cg];B[ec]C[MM: This response to White's low pincer is not shown in Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, but it looks reasonable given the Black structure to the right.]
;W[ed];B[dd];W[fc]
(;B[ee];W[eb];B[fe];W[bd]C[horrible.

MM: Better than your other variation, and this really isn't so bad, if you connect to the right or the bottom and get a large center.]
;B[cd]TR[if][ei][hd][di][fi][jf][hf][hc][ic]SQ[dd][de]C[MM: Now THAT'S horrible. You're making an empty triangle, in the hope of separating the corner from the left side... but wouldn't it be better to make sure you're ALIVE first?  (And... Don't Make Empty Triangles!)  Much better would be something near J14, E11, or maybe H16 if you think you can kill the K16 stone.]
;W[cc]TR[bc]C[MM: I like B17 better for White.];B[be];W[bc]
;B[ck]C[MM: That looks pretty good. You're getting some use from the wall you built. Much better than 4 formless floating stones running for eyespace.]
;W[cj];B[dj]TR[dk]C[MM: At this point, White has a base on the left, but really only room for one eye, I think.This fighting will be tricky, and I don't want to explore dozens of variations only to miss the moves that are obvious to the dan-level players. Instead, I'll just say that my feel for it is that D9 is probably better, because it gives White fewer forcing moves, and even if White lives on the side then Black will have juicy attacks against the lower left corner.]
;W[cf];B[ci]C[MM: Lets white off the hook, but may be reasonable if you're worried about winning the fight on the side. It might be good anyway, if you're next planning to invade the corner.]
;W[ce]C[MM: Now most of the Whites are safe. Later Black may need to make sure the 5 around D15 can connect to safety.]
;B[co]C[MM: Good. I am not sure if this is the best invasion point. I would probably play C3 because it is more familiar, but this looks good.]

(;W[gp]C[MM: White at F4 looks better.];B[fp];W[gn];B[go]C[MM: Success for Black!]
;W[bj];B[bi]TR[di][eh][cd][dd][de][ee][fe]C[MM: It might be better to let the 2 Whites escape, and connect the 5 Blacks with D11 or E12. It would be a shame if the 5 stones around D15 got cut off now.]
;W[di];B[bk];W[ej];B[dk];W[jf]C[MM: It's starting to look tricky for Black.]
;B[ei];W[fj]TR[dh]C[MM: ?? why doesn't White extend at D12?]
;B[dh]C[MM: Black now seems a little behind on territory, but Black is alive and thick all over, and facing the center from the right, the bottom, and the left. White has 5 floating stones in the center that Black can profitably attack on a large scale. I think Black has a better chance to win now.]
;W[ld];B[md];W[kc];B[mb];W[oa]TR[hj][ih]C[MM: Slack. White doesn't need to do this now. Something like H10 or J12 looks better.]

(;B[ng]C[MM: Missing the point; too defensive. How about K12 instead?]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[ji]C[MM: Hmm, now White looks connected. It will be tough for Black to kill the White stones in the center. White appears to be ahead on territory by about 10 pts.  By keeping sente, Black can still win in the endgame.]

Kyotuu [14k\]: what is it based on?
lotek [13k\]: i have seen it but i thought it was a joke
Kyotuu [14k\]: maybe its cuz its hard to control the center if you only have corners...?

i was wondering if you could enlighten me on the proverb and its application, and any comments on the play or direction of play would be nice, thanks.               -kyotuu


MM: So Black wins by 4.5.
"If you have 4 corners, resign" is especially applicable to Black in handicap games. I think the proverb originally was "if you lose 4 corners, resign" because you were obviously behind on territory. Then I guess Go Seigen, Kitani Minoru, and Takemiya Masaki came along with strong center-oriented play, and they often won by taking the center and keeping the opponent separated and isolated in the corners. So it became humorous to restate the proverb as "if you win 4 corners, resign" since it probably meant the oppenent had a large center territory. Since the two proverbs conflict, some people put it as "if one player has all 4 corners, then Black should resign".  Evidently not the case here.
Thanks for the opportunity to review your game. It was fun, and I hope I did not make too many errors. Please contact me again if you have questions or if you find a mistake I made.]
