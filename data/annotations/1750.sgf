;B[co]TR[fj][qn]C[This is a rather slow move..
It is making W teritory a bit smaller and squeezing him to force into the center but i would tend to play bigger moves like the triangle places.]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[kp];B[jq];W[kq];B[jr];W[gd]C[The only big problem i was in this opening for B is you have let W play all the invasion moves :) IT is not bad. Anyway W is weak.]

both the top and upper left corner...];B[fb];W[gb];B[ec];W[hc]
;B[ea];W[bl];B[aj];W[dg]LB[jg:B][fj:A]C[It is not bad till here. You can always run to the center with moves like 'a' or 'b'.
At this point to seperate the last W stone played from other I would tend to play the rect. marked stone. And the following sequence could have happened.]

(;B[cg]C[The moral of the story is:
You should try to cut and confine you opponent to small spaces while you are either securing big territory on the other side or attacking two weak White groups at the same time...]

Not a good thing... You should take the initiative.];B[ag];W[ee]

but there are bigger and more important moves. You should attack the W group on the right bottom. And use this attack as a chance to get territory.]
;W[hn];B[hl]TR[fj][fl][hl]C[These 3 moves are not giving you any territory. And taking just a bit from W.]

R you trying to surround W? Why? W has tones of eyes, and there is no way you can kill him... And surrounding him will not help you get territory. He has other ways to move out...

Is the last move helping your stones? No because they don't need help. But the other group in the top does. So we should helping the group above...
A possible move coould be the variation.];W[li];B[mh];W[mf]

the upper corner becomes problematic...    Also, while I manage to keep black stones connected though I
never seem to assemble 2 eyes to keep the group alive, which
turns out slightly costly.];W[oi];B[pi];W[oj];B[oe];W[mj]C[This probably is where B is cut for good.]
