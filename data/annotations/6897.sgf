C[Dear reviewer,
thank you very much for your time.
This is a game i played recently as black. Komi is 0.5.
I added some variations and questions so you can see my way of thinking.
I would be very happy if you could comment on them and show me better moves.

FM: hello, my name is Martin and my comments will begin with FM: as my nick is Field Mouse.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dp];W[dd];B[oq];W[lp];B[pm];W[po];B[mo]C[I am not really familiar with this black move. Could you show me a few common variations?]
;W[lo];B[mn]
(;W[mp]C[FM: this white move looks like the shapepoint, but is probably not very good. White wants to force black to connect his stones while protecting the corner]

(;B[np]C[FM: this move looks natural, I think its ok];W[oo]
LB[om:A]C[FM: better to play A directly, leaving more aji];B[no]
;W[om]LB[pk:B][pl:A][ln:C][on:F][ip:E][qr:D]C[The game move is E, but i thought about A-D, too. Where would you play?

FM: D and F are the main white weaknesses black should aim at - I would strenghten the lone stone at A or B]

(;B[ip]C[FM: too hasty];W[jo]
(;B[km]LB[ml:B][io:A]C[I this the vital point?

FM: This move tries to attack white too much, but doesnt cause white real trouble. Just playing simply A or B was better.]
;W[io]
(;B[hp];W[im]
(;B[fd]C[Ladder breaker.];W[cf]
(;B[ol];W[nm];B[on]TR[ol]C[Is this a good move?

FM: I think if white defends correctly, he comes out with the upper hand - black marked stone was a mistake.]
;W[pn];B[nn]
(;W[nl];B[pl]C[FM: black is happy to connect here]
(;W[pq]
(;B[nk]C[I was very happy to play here.]
(;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[jk]C[This move captures white 3 stones, attacks white bottom group and expands the black moyo. It also induce black to play F4 fix.

FM: black is very happy with this];W[gn];B[fp];W[hk]TR[jk][gn]
[fp]C[FM: the marked sente exchange is a reason for a small celebration]
;B[qc]LB[kc:A][lc:C][oc:E][ld:B][nd:D]C[My idea was that after A-B-C-D-E the black moyo is big. Is this a good idea?

FM: This move is ok, black is in the lead now];W[kc];B[ld];W[lc]
;B[nd];W[fc]LB[ec:A][gc:B]C[I did not expect this move. How should black answer?

FM: there are two basic answers for this kind of shape: A and B]

(;B[oc]LB[mc:A][kd:B]C[Is this aji-keshi?

FM: giving up the A move makes B much bigger now - you should play this move only if you want to continue at B.]
;W[nb];B[ii]LB[kd:B][gj:A]C[My idea was that A and B are miai now.

FM: after white naturaly answers at B, this move and A won't be really big.]
;W[kd]
(;B[gj];W[le]LB[kq:A]TR[kd][ii][gj]C[I did not expect this move. How should black play now?

FM: this move is extremely huge. If black cannot get any compensation by attacking white now, the marked exchange was a huge loss. To start an attack, I think A is good now, it is locally quite big and efficiently removing white eye base on the side, forcing him to run away - black hopes to chase white a bit and take some profit on the left.]

(;B[el]C[FM: if white doesn't die, this move is not worth much]
;W[jp]
(;B[dg]C[FM: forcing white to take points on the side, white not building much]
;W[cg];B[dh]
(;W[ci]C[Is this an overplay?

FM: usualy white plays more solidly, there are very bad aji left in the corner now]
;B[ch];W[bh];B[bg];W[bj]C[FM: although this shape looks natural, it actualy is very bad. White should be always very careful when playing this tiger mouths]
;B[ah];W[bi]

;W[bf];B[be];W[ag];B[cc];W[dc];B[cb];W[db];B[cd];W[gd]C[Is this result ok for black?]

(;B[ae]C[This move is very stupid. The corner is already alive!

FM: actually, it was a thousand year ko shape];W[di]C[Now the black 4 stones feel bad.]

(;B[ei];W[ej];B[fi]C[Black has bad shape.];W[fg];B[ff]C[This and the next few black moves are very very stupid.
