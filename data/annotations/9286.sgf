C[Hello,

I'm Clement, your reviewer for this game. Hope you'll enjoy the review.

Feel free to contact me on KGS (cb22) if you have some questions.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[op]C[Deterius [6k\]: I saw a teaching game where the move was introduced. It was kind of a trail for me.
Deterius [6k\]: In the end it did not work.

cb22 : so far, so good, it's a very good idea to practice what you have seen in teaching games, but it can turn sour ^^]
;W[dc];B[fq]LB[de:A]C[Deterius [6k\]: One of my faforit moves in the beginning.

cb22 : after looking on fuseki info, I didn't found any games with this opening. Most moves are around A instead of f3. For you to know, p4 is not really played (22 games for 11000 games !)]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[hq]C[Deterius [6k\]: Here I get the first problem]

(;B[jq]C[Deterius [6k\]: I thought I can keep D3 and F3 alive so I pincered H3

cb22 : not really playable here. see previous variation.];W[fp]
;B[gq];W[gp]
(;B[hp]
(;W[ip];B[hr]C[cb22 : cutting and sacrificing your stone is not a good idea. Your offering a ponnuki to white which is very powerful. If you cut it's because you want to separate groups]
;W[ho]
(;B[iq]C[cb22 : and your giving sente by the end :/];W[cq]C[Deterius [6k\]: So I got a living group and W a strong out side.
Deterius [6k\]: I guse it was the better deal for W?

cb22 : well, no corner, no influence, very small territory vs great influence, stabilized stones some points and invasion possible around n3... it's the best deal for white !]
;B[ko]C[cb22 : not urgent.

In go remember always :

1) play corner
2) play a kakari (like D15 or C15 here) or shimari (like R3)
3) play to make a life base, threat an opponent group's life
4) play big point (like R10, K17, K16), grow your moyo or reduce your opponent one
5) play double sente moves
6) finish moves

Here your in the 4) but there's so much bigger point to play ! attack D17, protect P4,... Your move looks big but it's small a this stage.

Try to remember this ;)];W[nc];B[qf];W[jd];B[de]C[Deterius [6k\]: Noe I thought it is time to get to the left side.
Deterius [6k\]: The bottom is strong so try it on the top

cb22 : after some research to remember, this move is wrong in this case because of k16 already here. White answer is very good in this case.]
;W[dh]C[cb22 : very good for white];B[fd];W[ee];B[ed];W[dd]
;B[df];W[ge]C[Deterius [6k\]: Here I thought my bee Ican get one of the groups living.]
;B[fe]C[cb22 : not joseki. I let you make some research on the net ;-) (try eidogo.com) You will see why d14 wasn't good in the beginning !]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[ff];B[gf];W[fg];B[fh];W[gg];B[hf];W[dg];B[hd]
C[cb22 : white has everything, black is small and not alive because of k16]
;W[ie];B[he];W[jg];B[eh];W[di]C[Deterius [6k\]: Here I was a bit surprised. W missed the ladder.

cb22 : lucky !];B[hg];W[gh];B[gi]C[jaska: oops];W[qp]C[Deterius [6k\]: Here I pay for P4.
Deterius [6k\]: May bee it is a good move, but I do not know what to do with it.

cb22 : one possible approach but it's a mistake of white because of k3. white should come at san san]

(;B[pn]C[cb22 : why here ?]
(;W[oq]
(;B[np]C[cb22 : far too submissive !! See variations];W[nq]
;B[mq];W[pp];B[on];W[rn];B[ql];W[mr];B[lq];W[ji]C[Deterius [6k\]: Now W has a big corner

cb22 : not only, he is sente ! big points, destroy black potential and sente... well, if not for his earlier mistake, black could resign !]
;B[hh];W[pb]
(;B[qc];W[ne]C[Deterius [6k\]: An W creates a big center

cb22 : what is big ? this move is small in term of territory. And you can still reduce the upper side later.]
;B[be]C[Deterius [6k\]: Here I thought I can threaten the corner and D12

cb22 : good idea. A better player could find a way to kill corner maybe.]
;W[bd]
(;B[pi]C[cb22 : why have you stop your previous idea ?];W[qj]
C[Deterius [6k\]: It should be possible to stop a invasion like that

cb22 : surely];B[qi];W[ri]
(;B[rh];W[rl];B[rk];W[qm];B[qk];W[pm];B[dk]C[Deterius [6k\]: Now thw D12 group]

[ho][io][jo][fp][gp][ip][jp][hq][ir][jr][hs][is][js]C[cb22 : clearly your opponent seems stronger, but you could have win after his ladder mistake. You made some bad choices of area of play.

You've played quite well and it honors you to try new things but maybe (it's only my point of view) you should try to reinforce your basics before trying new openings.

I've seen some submissive moves, some bad exchange, but the worst was this strange opening not so well mastered. You've missed some turntable moves but it's the game ! maybe not enough time to read the flow ?

Try to remember the order of moves (corner, approach, life, urgent, big/moyo,...) It will help you to take some time thinking about the overall situation and clean your mind. You've lost sente (keep it in mind ! sente for me is like playing a ten point move) a lot and you should try to review the joseki where it went wrong for you (both south corner)

Hope you'll enjoy this review, feel free to ask me on KGS ;)]

It could be good if you have a plan to separate o17 from the triangle group, but it's white turn to play...]
