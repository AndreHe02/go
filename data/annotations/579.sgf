;B[dd];W[kj];B[ck];W[jd];B[gk]C[In the context of this 13x13 game, this move looks fine. A
more ambitious approach move such as J3 would be
more normal in a 19x19 game, but here there is less
space for groups on the board so if white follows up with a pincer  the consequences could be more serious.   G4 would be better here, I think. No reason for both black's
stones on the lower edge to be low.];W[gd]C[The standard approach move at F11 would seem more
appropriate, even on 13x13.];B[gb]C[This move certainly won't secure any territory. White should
now play to split black's D10 and G12 stones, maybe playing at E11?
A better alternative for black would be D7, which gives him a good
double-wing formation (although G3 still looks low).];W[ib]
C[White can be more aggressive. If black tries to attack the K10
corner he will just strengthen white's formation which will turn
the right side from possible to likely territory.];B[fc];W[gc]
;B[db]C[This is a good exchange for black.];W[hb];B[fb]C[Black should Tenuki here. The threat he is defending against here
is much smaller than the value of sente. G7 looks like a tempting
alternative.  Or K3.];W[ik]C[This is good for white, he is building a double-wing
formation.];B[dh]C[Now this looks like a tight game. The centre point is important now! I'm not sure
if black can invade the right side.];W[ke]C[I would be very tempted as white to have played G7 instead.]
;B[jh]C[OK now there is going to be a big fight. Note that if white  had a stone on G7 instead of L9, black would be forced to
try to live on the edge, not a happy prospect (but ask someone
who is better at invasions than I am).

White must cut black off now. H6?];W[kh]C[This doesn't buy white anything.]
;B[hh]C[Now black is happy. White should try to invade the left hand
side immediately. D8?];W[jg]C[Both white groups are strong. Invade!]
;B[ii];W[ji];B[ih];W[ij];B[gi]C[Black is winning.];W[hf]C[If black defends against invasion now with D9 say (which is boring but
strong) then the game is over.];B[ee]C[Great!];W[cf]C[Too late.]

;B[ch]C[B4 is better. Keeps strength while keeping white too short of space to make 2
eyes.];W[bj];B[bg];W[ai];B[cg];W[bk]C[OK, now white is winning.]
;B[bl];W[al]C[Normally this would be wrong because a black throw-in at A3 takes away  white's eye space. In this case white gets away with it because black can't allow
white C2. After black defends himself at C2, white must still play A3 to be safe,
so white has allowed black to play a move he wanted (C2, strengthening his lower
edge) for free. Not good.];B[ak];W[aj]C[Now C2 kills white.]
;B[cl];W[dj];B[dk]C[Still scope for a fight now. This contact move is not necessary.  E2 is better.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[hl]C[White must be lost now if black plays G2.]
;B[gl];W[gg];B[gh]C[F6 is better.];W[eh];B[fh]C[This was a bad 2-move sequence for black. He has an
empty triangle F6-G6-G5. Play F7 instead because it
is imperative to keep white from escaping. If white escapes
the game is over.];W[eg]MA[bg][cg][ch][dh]C[Good. It threaten to cut off black's marked group in 2 different
ways.];B[ei]C[Ouch. D5 for white now. Unfortunately white is still cut
off because of black F7.];W[di];B[fi];W[ag]C[Linking a group with one eye to a group with no eyes
produces a group with one eye. Black must play
D7 now.];B[fg];W[bf];B[dg];W[cj]C[This doesn't make any more eyes. The only hope for
white would be to hack through with F4 but it
doesn't work.];B[fk]C[Good. Black can sit back now and play quite defensively.]
