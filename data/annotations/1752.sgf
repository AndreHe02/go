C[I think I might have played this game too poorly and am looking for  pointers to better openings and mid-games. I would also like to know if I  would have lost if the game continued (which I think might have been very  likely.)

D:  Hi, I'm Darrell and I am going to review your game.  I'll try to answer all of your questions, but feel free to email me any follow up questions.]
;B[dc];W[pp];B[qd];W[dq];B[oc];W[ce]C[I am usually a very defensive player, so I decided to take the  offensive for this game. I don't think it makes a difference, but would it  have been better to safeguard the corner with C5 before attacking?

D:  Your move seems fine to me.  Either move is normal (good) and I have no preference other than whether I'm in a fighting mood at the moment.]
;B[qn];W[np];B[qk];W[fc]LB[ed:a][ec:b][fd:c][gc:d][dj:e]C[Not too sure as to how to continue after 10. My joseki is very bad.  Also, maybe I should play around C12 to get the left side?

D:  Again, your move seems quite fine.  Puts heavy pressure on 1.  Play at 'a' is also quite good.  Less of a fight as black will live with 'b' and 'd'.  White gets a nice wall at 6, 'a' and 'c' and can follow up with something like 'e' for a large moyo.]
;B[cd];W[de];B[eb];W[ec];B[fb];W[ci]C[Well, I played as best as I felt it to be. Wonder how can I make it  better?

Good move.];B[gc];W[ee];B[jd];W[co];B[iq];W[kq];B[fq]
(;W[qi]LB[ko:a]C[Is this move played too close? Should I have played R12 instead?

D:  This is the first move I really don't like.  Let's look the board over.  You have no weak groups to worry about.  Black does, however.  21 and 23 are very weak, and you should be able to profit by attacking them.  After chasing them for a bit, you would be in better position to try something in the top right if you want.    I would recommend a move at 'a'.  It does your lower right side a lot of good and really weakens the two black stones.  If black does not run, you can steal all of his eye space with a move at 'b'.  See variation 2 here.

Your move 24 is a deep invasion, landing right between two strong black groups that you cannot hope to attack at all.  A move like this should only be made if you are definately behind in the game and don't have some better way to get caught up.]
;B[qg];W[oi];B[og]C[Instead, black attacks your group and takes huge profit in the top right corner regardless of whether you live or die.]
;W[nk];B[ol];W[nh];B[qp];W[qq];B[rp];W[rq];B[po];W[op];B[oo]
;W[mn]C[Tried to keep Black's seeds in so that I can create a moyo (is that  term correctly used?) in the middle.

D:  Yes, the term is correct.  However, your moyo cannot take shape if black's tiny group on the bottom is allowed to settle itself and it sits right in the middle of your moyo.  Therefore, no moyo.  So again, I would prefer a move that pressures the bottom group more.  The black group on the lower right is very alive, so there is no threat there.]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[ok];W[nj];B[ri];W[fi]LB[gr:a]C[Trying to link up my seeds to get the territory in the middle. I'm  not too sure, but it seems to me at this point that I had the lead, but I  lost it later... Badly need comments on where I should have played to make  it better.

Your order of priorities should be:
1.  Do I have any groups in trouble that should be defended?
2.  Does opponent have any weak groups I could attack?
3.  How can I make territory?

Territory is last.  Any move that does more than one at a time is better.  But still, the priorities are above.

Therefore, since you've built strength on the right now, I would just attack the group on the bottom straight away.  I still like 'a'.]
;B[in];W[fn];B[cl]C[Is 47 workable? I mean, is it possible for Black to live there?  Should I just ignore it and play somewhere else?

D:  I would not ignore it.  Kill it.];W[bk];B[bl];W[dm];B[bn]
;W[bo];B[cm]C[Since I wasn't sure, I decided to ensure it is dead before moving  somewhere else.

D:  It's not dead yet and black is still moving there.  Stay with it.]
;W[mf];B[md];W[kf]C[Was 54 and 56 good moves? It seemed a little 'slow' to me, but I was  not confident of 'thinner' moves.

D:  The amount of territory you are encircling is huge.  However, if Black has living groups running around in it, it is meaningless.  The moves would do more good attacking the weak black groups that have invaded your stronghold.]
;B[if];W[jh]C[Black 'broke' my defense (if I had any in the first place...)

Should 58 be at J12 instead? So that Black cannot play 59?]
;B[ih];W[ii];B[jg];W[kg];B[hi]C[I started losing it here. Was being pressed for time, hence I played  as instinct told me to, trying not to waste too much time thinking.]
;W[hh];B[ig];W[ji]C[66 should have been at L11 for more effectiveness right?]
;B[hj];W[il]C[I am very greedy here, was trying to stop 63 and 67 from connecting  to the stones near the bottom so that I can keep the territory in the  middle.]
;B[gl];W[gm];B[gh];W[hg];B[gg];W[hf];B[he];W[gf];B[ie];W[fg]
LB[ff:a]C[78, if it is to be played somewhere more effectively, where should  it go? I was still playing by instinct and it told me to ensure the group of  4 stones will live while striking back at Black.

D:  play at 'a'];B[fh];W[fe];B[gi];W[ei];B[ek];W[dl];B[ck];W[bj]
;B[dk];W[fj]TR[ei][fi]LB[hl:a]C[These two stones plus 88 is an empty triangle.  Bad shape.  Before making one of these, look hard for a better move.  perhaps 'a' to keep your stones strong and to help enclose the stones you are attacking.]
;B[fk];W[hk];B[eg];W[ff];B[eh];W[cg]CR[di][ik][hl][im][dn]C[Too weak.  you are leaving way too many cutting points with this move.  Much better to play a solid move.  Look at all your weaknesses.  You cannot win a fight while leaving multiple weaknesses behind.  Something will always go wrong.]
;B[hl];W[hm]C[Preventing connection at all costs...];B[ik];W[ij]
;B[jk];W[gj]C[neglected D11...

D:  Yes.  Consequence of the empty triangle.];B[gk];W[jl];B[di]
;W[kk]C[Would Black have lived at this point? Or was there still a chance  for me to win? I feel that the 'eye' at B7 can be destroyed by playing A7,  and Black can only create one eye around the F10 area. Am I wrong?

D:  Black should live easily.  See variation 2.]
(;B[dn];W[em];B[eo];W[cn];B[eq];W[cq]CR[im]C[Here, Black ran out of time, so I won. But I feel that I might have  lost if the game continued. The main struggle is in the middle right? Is  Black alive or dead?

D:  Black is alive in the middle.  And if black cuts at the red dot, I don't see the six white stones living, so black lives on the bottom easily too.  So black is way ahead.

All in all, you are much much stronger than 30 kyu.  There were many many very good moves you made.  I don't know if you were serious about that as a rating.  The main points to remember are the 1,2,3 priority I explained, and the point about leaving weaknesses during a fight.  Hope this helps.

;W[jr]C[Black will have a hard time with this group.  If it dies, white gets huge profit.  But to run out into the middle with it and try to make it live guarantees white will make good profit on the left side in sente.]
