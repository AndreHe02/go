AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[My opponent engaged me in very complicated fighting, and came out the better. I feel like I could have won this game if I hadn't tried to kill all the stones, or if I had played a few moves differently at crucial points. The life and death problem at w's move 147 is a really interesting sequence at which I failed miserably.

Hi Tom, hope you'll enjoy the review. I was pretty brief at some points added variations here and there. GL in your go! :)]

C[A7 ONLY move - will W take 4 points in gote?

I guess you need to defend more. Leaving weak groups and cutting points behind will hurt later much more than spending one move earlier. Especially in handicap game you should not overattack as your opponent is stronger and you don't need to kill as you start with advantage.
