AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[(jh) 

So, thanks for the opportunity to review a game. I always learn a lot from the process myself. 

I was about 9k when I signed up for the teaching ladder, had taken a break until about a month ago and am playing at about 10k (KGS) now. So perhaps I haven't the degree of strength to really give a star review. I'll do the best I can nonetheless. Sincerely hope that my comments are helpful.

It seems like both players played a good game for their levels. I did wonder why you played with a four-stone handicap if you only have one kyu of difference in your ratings. That Black won surprises me all the more.

I did see a number of points in the middle and endgame (yose) which could have changed the result. And a number of big points which both players ignored much too long. Plenty of good solid play on both sides - which is already something.

Do look at the variations and the comments. 

Perhaps next time you submit a review, you can post some questions and comments yourself so that the reviewer knows better what he should look for and what you've already thought about.

Anyway, enjoy the review and best of luck in future games.

May the force be with you!

;B[nc]C[(3) weber:  hi];W[rd];B[qc]C[(5) -> hello];W[qi]C[(jh) this is joseki, but I wonder if white shouldn't perhaps be a bit more daring and play a line lower. Or tenuki and raise hell elsewhere. Joseki give "even results" which of course isn't enough in handicap games.]
;B[ql]LB[ok:C][pn:A][qn:B]C[(7) -> let's fly a kite! :D

(jh) Here Black is taking chances. If White feels like a fighter, perhaps he should take him up on it and invade at A or B. Or push at C, threatening a later invasion.]
;W[nq];B[oq]C[(jh) Good response for Black.];W[np];B[oo];W[jq]
;B[hq]LB[fp:A][fq:B]C[(jh) Black again seems to be playing boldly. If White has a bit of strength on the side - and perhaps playing strength to merit the 4-stone handicap, then all the more he could make things difficult with an invasion at A or B.]
;W[jo];B[ho]C[(jh) This seems too good for Black];W[qq];B[qp]
C[(jh) Not a bad invasion, but it alows Black to strengthen his side. Making R3 a "thank you move". To boot, I wonder why White doesn't finish in sente with the invasion (see variation).]

(;W[ic]C[(jh) The assumption with a move like this is that White can extend well both ways...]
;B[gc];W[cj]LB[lc:A]C[(jh) So I wonder why he didn't play A now. Following the proverb "essential moves before big moves").]
;B[cl];W[cf]LB[ch:A]C[(jh) That's a bit more daring. Black could have made troubles at A. Good to be able to bluff a bit as White.]
;B[ce]C[(jh) This time this is a thank you move from Black. Allows White to do what he was wanting to do anyway.]
;W[df];B[ee];W[lc]C[(jh) Good. Not a moment too soon.];B[mn]
C[(jh) A good reducing move from Black. I would respond by closing off the side. White can always escape to the center later.]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[jn]LB[lp:A]C[(jh) Not sure if this is the best response. Black's next move at A is pretty painful.]
;B[lp]C[(jh) Good for Black];W[lr];B[kp];W[jp];B[me]C[(jh) Good for Black. Attacking with the knight's move.]
;W[ol]LB[ok:A]C[(jh) Here too A might be better.];B[om];W[pl]
C[tship: This is bad, right?  Where's the move?

(jh) In my opinion this is the right move.];B[pm];W[qk]C[tship: should be O8?

(jh) No, again, this looks like correct play to me.];B[rl];W[rk]
;B[nl];W[oj]C[(jh) If this is what you feel uncomfortable about (in doubting your last moves), you shouldn't. You protected the side and still have interesting moves open to you.]
;B[mj];W[or]LB[nk:A]C[(jh) This might have been a good time to push and cut at "A"
 (see variation).];B[pq]LB[pr:A]C[(jh) Why not finish up here and play "A" in sente?]

(;W[ej]C[tship: C6 instead?

(jh) Would be more interesting];B[el];W[cq]C[(jh) Not a moment too soon.]

(;W[cg]LB[gb:D][mb:C][rc:E][of:B][ag:A][ni:I][bk:J][ml:K][rm:L]
[pr:H][es:F][hs:G]C[(jh) "A" does it better. A Black cut here is unsuccessful (see variations). At this point White is ahead in the game and should concentrate on getting the big yose sente moves (like "B" through "L" perhaps). If he does, he can win.]
;B[bj]C[(jh) Bad for black, B9 better.];W[bk]C[(jh) Correct response.]
;B[ck];W[bi];B[bl];W[aj];B[hb]C[(jh) These are the points that will decide the game.]

(;W[qg]C[(jh) Here I think double hane would work (see variations).]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[oh];W[oi];B[nh];W[mi]C[(jh) This series is too good for Black]
;B[pr];W[nr]C[(jh) points like this are perhaps less important than the big sente points that are still open. If Black captures it's gote for him. (Of course White's playing Q2 earlier would have been even better).]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[no]
(;W[mp]LB[ml:A]C[(jh) This is much smaller than playing at "A" (see variation).]
;B[nj];W[ni];B[mk];W[nm]C[(jh) If White wants to put this stone in atari, why not with N8?]
;B[ok];W[pk];B[mm]C[(jh) Good for Black.];W[ln];B[lo]C[(jh) This didn't help White much, especially since he doesn't extend out of atari.]

(;W[ob];B[oc];W[pb];B[qb];W[sb]C[(jh) Good];B[rc];W[sc];B[pc]
;W[oa];B[lm]C[(jh) Good for Black. Could White have utilized this earlier? Yes, see variation around 162]

(;W[eq];B[cs]
(;W[cr]C[(jh) Would Black at C2 really be a problem?];B[er]
C[(jh) This seems like a strange ko fight to me. Not much to win or lose for either side (1/2 point?). There are other bigger moves on the board for both White and Black, and perhaps more interesting ko to save those threats for.]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[eq];B[ij];W[ii];B[er];W[fe];B[ge];W[eq];B[ec]
C[(jh) Not necessary for Black.];W[gq]C[(jh) A more interesting move.]
;B[er];W[de];B[ed];W[eq]C[(jh) Now the ko is worth something.]
;B[ma];W[kb];B[er]
(;W[qm]C[(jh) This is less interesting as a ko threat, because White loses his ability for lots of tasty sente later on (see variations).]
;B[rm];W[eq];B[kr];W[kq]C[(jh) Correct];B[er];W[ps];B[qs];W[os]
C[(jh) Here White could retake the ko. He doesn't gain much by connecting here and R2 would be another threat.]
;B[qr];W[eq];B[fp];W[gp]C[(jh) Clearly a mistake (Black shows this).]

;B[go];W[nk];B[nn]C[(jh) Ko's like this are small (1/2 point). Play other moves first.]

(;W[ok];B[km]C[(jh) Good gote for Black. What would have happened if white had played here? (see variation).]

;W[dl]C[(jh) Good for White. Black should have played D9 earlier.]
;B[em];W[dk];B[dm];W[ha];B[gb]C[(jh) Black seems to be in no mood for another little ko.]
;W[ia];B[al];W[ak];B[ah];W[ag];B[af];W[ma];B[an];W[ap]C[(jh) Good]

[gq][qq][rq][sq][rr][sr][rs][ss]C[(jh) Well played by both sides. Overall I'd say White needs to be more aggressive in fuseki (especially against four handicap stones) and to seize opportunities on time (many of which I mentioned). There was a point around move 135 where the game was more or less even. After which Black stepped on the gas.

It's good to keep in mind the rules of thumb:
 
- first play the big double sente moves (moves in areas that would be sente for both sides)
- then big sente moves
- then smaller double sente moves and big gote moves
- then smaller gote moves
- 1/2 point ko's are seldom worthwhile
- dame never so

I find endgames fascinating, we could all pick up a few points by taking yose more seriously. (Great stuff on this point is of course to be found on http://senseis.xmp.net).

Once again, best of luck on the goban,
