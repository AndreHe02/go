C[S.

Hi, my name is Simon. I'm trying to break into 9k before my second year of university starts. I am coming very close to my goal. However, I've been meeting some very strong opponents like the one in this game.

My opponent I felt was very good at making the game very confusing. I felt that he did a lot of things that I did not really expect which is why I am sending this game in for review. I walked out from this game fairly exhausted.

Thanks in advice for the review. :)];B[qd]C[N:

Hi, I'm Neil - I play as neilh23 on a few servers, I'm about a KGS 4k.

I'll comment as best I can, obviously a stronger player would find better suggestions for alternative moves, so take any lines I suggest as a guide.

Both players made reading mistakes, but you played reasonably against your opponent here and should have actually won this game if you hadn't misread the invasion at the end.

Both players ignored the big points in favour of smaller local moves for a large chunk of the game - you should get into the habit of looking for the biggest points before making any local move!

Other than that, you played a lot of hane and atari moves without considering the cutting points you were leaving!]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc]C[S.

This is normally how I start my games

N:

Yes, common opening];W[qj];B[ql]C[S.

I hear it is best to approach from this side so that when white does the following...]
;W[qg]SQ[og]C[S.

Black has the possibility of capping here and give white some trouble]
;B[fq]C[N: Perfectly normal opening];W[nq]C[S.

I did not expect this from white

N:

Seems an OK move to me. White is aiming for the corner - the pincer seems the best reply, as it works with F3, and because black has an invasion point at R6 (see variation for next move)]

(;B[kp]TR[lq]C[S.

My first thought was to pincer at Triangle

I am not sure if this move coordinates well.

N:

This feels awkward - if you were going for a fourth line play, then K4 feels more balanced, and definitely playable. M3 would have been severe on the white stone.]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[qr]C[S.

I felt this was overplay

N:

Yes]
(;B[pr]C[N:
As was this ...];W[oq];B[rr];W[qp]C[S.

However, I was not expecting this

White does a lot of counter ataris this game which really threw me off since I dont expect them often.

N:

This is a completely natural move from white, and about the one one I'd consider.

When you're reading any position, always look at the cutting points and read out what would happen if your opponent played there!]
;B[rq];W[po]C[S.

Since white has the ladder I figure it would be best to play elsewhere]

(;B[ol]TR[qg][qj]C[S.

I figure I can use my thickness to threaten the other group

N:

This is the right move - if you didn't play here, white could build a lot of strength harassing R8.

White's stones aren't in particular danger unless white ignores some moves, but you should be aiming to seal them in.]
;W[op]TR[oj]MA[cf][dn][fc]C[N:

Over-cautious move from white, don't think it was needed. This gives black the chance to play a big move! Look at all that big wide-open space to claim as yours ...
I'd look at playing one of the marked moves in the empty areas first, then aim at starting to seal white in with P10]
;B[kq]C[S.

I wanted to fix my shape so that white couln't slide under

Now that I look at it again my extension is one space too wide

Maybe I should have chosen a different pincer to accomodate for this

N:

This move is very slow! L4 is not in danger, and black would be happy for white to invade around J3, as it lets you attack the left hand corner!]
;W[oj]C[N:

White ignores the bigger moves and pushes black into the centre. Black's in no danger, so this is premature and helps black enclose the bottom white group]
;B[ml]C[S.

Wasnt sure how to react figure to gain strength to hurt the other side

N:

Continuing to jump out is the right thing - consider how well N8 works with the two stones at L4, this is a present from white!]
;W[lo]C[N:

White is trying to stop black from completely surround him, at the expense of the missing out N10]

(;B[mp]C[S.

Try to harass this shape

N:

Totally wrong idea! See variations.

It's too early to play a move like this, in situations like this, complete surround first, then invade.]
;W[or];B[qs]
(;W[rp]C[N:

Wrong direction from white - he should be trying to break out. M5 isn't completely lost ...]
;B[rn];W[ro]
(;B[mq]C[S.

Trying to steal eyes

N:

Aji keshi - white's shape points are at N2 and R6, this just helps him play N2!]
;W[sq];B[sr];W[os];B[ps];W[mr];B[lr];W[ms]C[S.

White has one eye]
(;B[oo]C[S.

I figure to make this eye false but white goes head and makes an eye on the other side anyway

N:

R6 should jump out here as the shape point];W[qn]
(;B[on]C[N:

Wrong - letting white get S6 is bad!];W[rm]SQ[oj][qg][qj]C[S.

This atari took me by suprise but I figure that it doesnt matter since white is alive anyway

N:

Too easy on white! It'll be hard to put pressure on the three stones above as he can now connect with S8.]
;B[cn]C[S.

Try to bug white for ignoring me earlier

N:

Good!

The high approach might have been better given black's influence to the right, but I'm not strong enough to comment]
;W[eo];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[dm]C[S.

Joseki up until this point]
(;B[cm]C[N:

Bad - black is just strengenthing white here, negating blacks influence on the right hand side!]
;W[dk]
(;B[dn]C[N:

Aji keshi. Locally, the best move would probably be the wedge at D8, but globally, I'd leave these stones for aji and play in the open space]
;W[em]C[S.

I try to break out which Isnt nececary I guess.];B[en];W[cl]
;B[fn]C[S.

I was surprised white would let me do this

N:

Yes, black is happy with this!]
(;W[bl]C[S.

Afraid of a monkey jump or something

N:

I have no idea what white's plan is here - the stones below are lost and he should be aiming to turn the upper left side into territory]

(;B[bm];W[fp]
(;B[gp]TR[bm][cm][cn][dn][en][fn]C[S.

This group can be cut away];W[gq]
(;B[gr]C[N:

You should have read more carefully here! Some tricky variations. I like E3 as a response.

Generally in situations like this, an atari like this is bad as it lets white counter-atari]
