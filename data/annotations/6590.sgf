C[Hello, dear reviewer!

I am Bernd, HonFu on KGS and GTL, crazy about go since September 2006.

This is a tournament game. After a loss in the opening I succeed in an attack and can finally, after heavy fighting, carry the win home. Still, there were a lot of moves that seemed to be quite ambiguous ...

N: Hello, my comments are preceded with "N:" I commented on places, where it seemed usefull. Your biggest issue during this game seemed to be your preception. Maybe you should try to count better?
Regards, Nelis];B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd]
;B[fq]C[B.: My intention was to probe first to find out if white extends to C6 or C7, so that I can adjust the continuation of the joseki in the upper left (see variations).]

(;W[dn]C[B.: Yes! A good chance, and so early! I thought.

N: indeed, white should play lower, now he is almost obliged to play first around C10.]
;B[dg]
(;W[fc];B[cl]C[B.: I just had to take this point, right? But now the extension is too wide and white can invade.

N: this is a logic point, you want to play around here, white around c10
your move is more severe on the white shape, wich seems to be floating.
It is logic to leave a gap, if you get something in return, as playing on a point, annoying to white.]
;W[dq]C[N: slow, and still an open skirt];B[iq];W[qn];B[np]
C[B.: At this moment I was not so sure about my opening anymore. Both on the left and on the lower side I now have extensions which seem a bit too wide.

N: you can't play fast and solid at the same time. It is also wrong only to look at your own position, include the opponents position as well.]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[qk]
(;B[nc]C[N: not sure about this move, the left seems more urgent to me.]
;W[cj]C[B.: So white comes splitting.
N: white still has a problem due to his open skirt.];B[el];W[ch]
;B[bg];W[fi]C[B.: I know the principle that one weak group between two weak groups is advantageous, but I never know when and how exactly it applies. I thought it's urgent to strengthen one of the groups, so that the other has more leeway.

N: of course];B[ed]C[B.: I chose the upper one, because the lower seemed to have an easier getaway, and it also still can slide into the corner.

N: ok];W[qf]C[B.: He did not answer the cut. So I thought: If I can get a ladder breaker, I can confine the upper left corner and rule the upper side.

N: white should have answered];B[pl]C[B.: But probably I should have pushed through first?

N: no, you can always push later];W[ql];B[pn]
(;W[pm];B[om];W[qm]C[B.: Luckily I end in sente ...];B[ec];W[eb]
;B[fb];W[db];B[gc];W[ol];B[fd]C[B.: ... and do what I have planned. Here my opponent and I disagreed in our quick post-game talk. He thought, capturing here was way too slow. I thought it was the only move.

N: it is the only move, it removes all aji, it makes you rock-solid, so the upper side becomes a dangerous are for white to invade, also the white group on the left becomes a lot weaker, as well as the white corner]
;W[on]
(;B[nm];W[po]
(;B[mn];W[no];B[mo];W[mp];B[nq]C[B.: I thought, this was good for me. My opponent creates another weak group, which might lead to trouble, when I come out and split from E8 later.

N: by playing carefull, this should be ok];W[mq];B[mr];W[lr]
;B[nr];W[kp];B[jo];W[ko];B[kn];W[jp];B[ip];W[jn];B[io];W[ln]
;B[km];W[lm];B[lo]C[B.: Up to here I read the sequence ...]
;W[op]
(;B[oq]C[N: here you should have examined the possibility to capture the cutting stones, they are very important, and your corner has a lot of liberties. Don't respond automatically]
;W[ll]C[B.: ... but the following moves finish off my stones, which was not what I was planning. At least I did not find a way to rescue them.

N: you missed your chance]
(;B[jm];W[nn]C[B.: Dead. This felt bad, I thought I had just begun to lose the game after the good start (maybe a bit irrational. After some self-calming I thought to do what I can do with the potential I have.

N: you gave a big present to white, but if you look at the overall position, white has a lot of problems:
- Upper left corner seems problematic
- Middle left is not connected
- Bottom left has a big open skirt and no definite eye-shape

Conlusion: i think you are not behind
Plan: kill the upper left or make ko, attack middle left (avoid connection to whites right side) and make a huge territory on top.]
;B[bn]C[N: finally];W[bp];B[er];W[dr];B[fk]C[B.: So attack starts. I want to induce him to give me territory on the upper side while running, and at the same time spoil his potential in the center. I was worrying about white playing M4 in sente against the lower right corner, but now this gote move was just too slow to take it myself.]
;W[hi];B[ei];W[ej];B[fj];W[eh];B[di];W[dh];B[gi];W[fh];B[gh]
C[B.: I had something like this in mind, but I am not sure if there was a way for white to handle the situation differently.

N: white's position was bad already];W[ef];B[df];W[gg];B[hg]
;W[hh];B[gj];W[gf];B[eg];W[fg];B[ig];W[ci]C[B.: Here I thought that white might get a second eye on the left side somehow, but confining the group still seemed more urgent, since stopping the white progress there is important for the upper side.]
;B[he];W[bh];B[bk];W[bj];B[ai];W[dl];B[dm];W[ck];B[bl]
(;W[rd]C[B.: The next 30 moves both of us won't see the aji at the left side for white's survival (see variation), so white won't live and black won't kill! (That probably hurts your eyes, sorry! ^_Â°)

N: you could have played a simple forcing move (wich might even make ko) against the corner.]

(;B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[qg];B[qc];W[pg];B[of];W[kf]C[B.: Now the cut at H14 might become ugly, and I have to be careful (was I careful?)]

(;B[jh];W[lg];B[kd];W[je]C[B.: Ouch! Didn't see this. Is there a defence?
N: Your reflexion should be that killing the white group is very necessary and so i would play there very solid, so i don't have to worry about that]

(;B[jc]C[B.: I thought like this I could connect. Pushing would let him cut in sente, and then he could pull H11 out (see variation).]
;W[hf];B[if];W[ie];B[ij]C[B.: Here I could get the net, just as planned, but ...]
;W[ic];B[hd];W[id]C[B.: ... he managed to cut me apart. Probably now finally I should play B15, but I thought, keeping pressure on the top center group was more urgent (especially since I still didn't see that white could live #^^#).

N: See previous comment, i think you should count.];B[nh];W[md]
;B[mc];W[jb];B[kb];W[li];B[be]C[B.: Phew.];W[ah]C[B.: Too late.]
;B[aj];W[bd];B[ad];W[ac];B[ae];W[bf];B[af];W[bb];B[hb];W[ib]
;B[ga]C[B.: Was there a way to kill me here?

N: not that i see immediately];W[rc]
(;B[lq]C[B.: Gote, but the biggest place, I thought. Correct?

N: more important is that it doesn't matter this much. You shouldn't play it because it is big, but because you are largely ahead and this move is very solid.
However first you should take p5, because now is the last moment it is sente.
