C[At the end, the score seems to indicate a save victory. However I am not at all sure If that is true.
It would be nice If you could comment the game for black.

forfun (hereafter ff) - Thanks for an exciting game to analyze.  I can not pretend that I understood everything that happened in this game.  Some of the fighting is pretty complex :-)  Both players seem to like to fight. At the same time both sometimes jump right in without checking too carefully.

I thought Black could improve by giving a little more thought to the direction of play.  Which groups are strong and which are weak; which stones are important and which do not matter so much.  Of course all of us have to do this better all of the time, but in this particular game it was what caught my eye about Black's play.  Black seemed to notice it too and asked a great question at move 159!  I have tried to give it a decent answer :-)]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[qe];W[ed];B[id]C[ff - A little unusual.  The two-space pincer is much more common.  This pincer is a little loose, especially when it is backed up by the shimari in the upper right.  It is quite possible that White will play elsewhere rather than answer this.]

(;W[kc]C[ff - This play is clearly an overplay when Black is strong in the upper right.  It is sometimes seen when the upper right is held by White.  Here it creates two weak stones.  White is still outnumbered 4 to 2 on the upper side.  Black wants to keep the stones securely separated.]

(;B[mc]C[ff - This feels like Black is playing from the wrong direction.  The upper right is already strong.]

(;W[dg]C[ff - If White is going to play here, why play at L17 first?]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[ef];W[dd];B[cf];W[ff]C[ff - These days this is less common than it used to be.  Some pros consider it a mistake in order because it weakens the D13 stone and allows Black to play more aggressively in the corner.  Black answers correctly here...]
;B[eg];W[cc];B[bd]C[ff - The earlier exchange of F14 for E13 makes this possible as we will see later.]
;W[ke]C[ff - Normally in the upper left White will finish with F16.  This may not be strictly necessary since Black's pincer is further away than in the normal joseki.  However, L15 is too optimistic.  White is unable to threaten the J16 stone and the upper right is very solid.  These two White stones have no real prospects.  Black should be able to just play naturally and achieve a comfortable position.]
;B[if];W[he];B[ie];W[hc];B[ic];W[hb]C[ff - This series of plays by White is very advantageous for Black.  A single play at G17 would have been interesting here, I think.]
;B[ib]C[ff - Black should be very happy here.  Black's wall is sticking out higher than White's two stones so Black waits for the chance to cap White.  Meanwhile Black has the connection underneath at L18 or can cut the White stones at L16.  Meanwhile the White position on the left still has defects in despite playing three times here.]
;W[cg]C[ff - This is the normal play when Black has descended at B16 instead of connecting at C15.  However, when Black has played E16 already, the White stones are not strong and Black can not be closed in.  Therefore Black chooses B16 after F14 and E13 have been exchanged.]

(;B[fg];W[bf]C[ff - Now Black must end up with some bad shape here.  This hane helps White's stones on the side no matter what happens.  It is better for Black not to allow this play.]
;B[hf]C[ff - Black has played two stones that strongly connect the two groups.  However, these plays are fairly slow.  There is the risk that Black will not get enough value for these stones.]
;W[ce];B[be]C[ff - A remarkably optimistic response. :-)  Can this work?]

(;W[df];B[de]
(;W[bc]C[ff - Similarly, if White connects what will Black do?]
;B[cf];W[pd];B[qd];W[oc]
(;B[ld]C[ff - This seems too defensive.  Black is very strong here, especially after playing F13 and H14.  Cutting off one stone at L17 would be a disappointing result...]
;W[qc];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[mb]
(;B[lb]C[ff - If Black simply plays L16, does White have any hope to live here?]

;W[kf]
(;B[mf];W[ja];B[ia];W[jb];B[na];W[ma]
(;B[qn]C[ff - There is a question whether Black should play from the other side at O3.  The upper right is too strong for Black to really want to try to build territory in front of it.]
;W[qj]
(;B[qh]C[ff - This is from the wrong side.  White has no threat in the corner except to reduce Black's territory by a couple of points...]
;W[nq]
(;B[rp]C[ff - Black can not expect White to passively answer this at R3.  See the variation...]
;W[qm]
(;B[rm]C[ff - This looks like the wrong direction.  The right side is smaller than the center and bottom side, which are still quite empty.  The hane on top looks like the most reasonable play here.  See the variation...]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[pm];B[po];W[oo];B[qq]C[ff - Black ends up in a very low position.  Luckily White makes a mistake in direction on the next play.  Note that Black has created a good chance for White by playing under the R7 stone instead of on top.]

(;B[nh]C[Is that move a mistake?

ff - Where are there weak stones remaining on the board?  For Black the stones coming out of the left side do not clearly have two eyes yet.  Also the two stones on the bottom side do not have two eyes.  For White the stones running out from the left side are not securely connected to the live group at the top.  Are the upper right stones in any danger? No, they are clearly safe.

The answer is yes, this is a mistake. Consider the variations...]

(;W[in]C[In the following fight black manages to get / keep a nice lead. however I am not sure if w missed something in the struggel of the next moves.

ff - Two points: Black starts with the advantage here and I don't think that Black does that well.  At the end of the sequence here it is not clear that Black is ahead!  In addition, I think that White possibly missed the strongest continuation right here at the beginning...]

(;W[jr]C[ff - White must connect here.  Why?  
First, at this point Black has only one eye.  The second eye is available by playing D2 but this is much smaller than capturing the stone at J2 in the game.
Second, when White tries to make territory in the center by cutting at K9 in the game, it turns O12 into a good play by Black!  Originally K9 only made a small increase in a safe territory.  After White plays at K9 the O12 stone becomes a dual-purpose play that effectively reduces White's potential territory.  If Black connects at K9 instead, trying to connect at the top, O12 remains a mistake.

Overall, consider what has happened here.  Remember that Black's original stone here was on J3.  We can see that Black has reduced White's corner somewhat and captured two stones, but White has captured two in return on the left side.  Meanwhile, White has driven right  through Black's position on the bottom and made over twenty points of territory.  I think that White gained quite a bit here.  Black played some sharp moves, backed up by good tactical reading, but the strategic result favored White.  I think the game would be roughly even if White had connected here.  I would prefer to be playing Black, but White would still have chances.]
))
(;W[gm]C[ff - The situation is very difficult for White but this might be better than in the game.  This play cuts off the Black stones on the side, unless Black captures these two White stones...]

;B[eo]C[ff - Black makes one eye...];W[gp];B[fo];W[ip]C[ff - White cuts off the center...]
;B[bo]C[ff - Black makes two eyes...];W[gr]C[ff - White connects to the corner while reducing the eye space of the bottom stones.

Now.  Can Black survive in the center or reduce it enough to win?  I do not know the answer?  :-)  The game is still in the balance.  But this situation arises because Black took time off in the game to play O12!]
))
(;B[hh]C[ff - This is the most aggressive approach.  It creates cutting points at L10 and L13 so the White left is cut off from the upper side.  White has to make two eyes or connect to the lower right wall.  However, the Black stones are also weak so it does not seems such a challenge for White.  This play by Black may to TOO aggressive... :-)]
)
(;B[hn]C[ff - This play almost makes two eyes and almost connects to the lower side Black stones...]
;W[hh];B[hg]C[ff - White grabs the three stones in sente, just as in the game.  But now what is the score? White's only significant territory is the lower left.  Black seems to be leading and all Black stones are reasonably safe.  Black can play the endgame with confidence.]
