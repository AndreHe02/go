C[Yukontodd [8k?\]: have a good game.:)
Andyka [9k\]: Have a good game

This is a CGA internet league game.  I'm playing white, I believe we're both ranked at 8k Canadian (pretty much the same as KGS ranks).  Time controls are 45+10/25 Canadian overtime, komi is 6.5.

I ended up winning in the end, but my concern is mainly on how I'm doing early on in the game.  Also curious about how I handled the attempted reduction of black's territory along the bottom, which seemed to work better than it probably should have until I blew it and let it die around move 80.  Until that point, I felt like I was playing very well ... was  I?

My games tend to be decided in a comedy of errors later on in the game, at my level.  I feel like my fuseki and moyo building makes me dominate the early game, and that later errors sometimes cost me dearly.  But am I setting myself up for those "mistakes" in my early game, or am I actually doing as nicely as I think I am up until my opponents and I start competing to see who's best at missing things?

Thank you very much!  This will be my first GTL review!

Hello Todd!
This will be my first review too :)
All my comments will start with the "###" (because why not..)
And I'm not a native speaker, so you might smile over the spelling sometimes. :)

Also, the diagonal opening (tasuki) doesnt really allow for deep strategic thinking. It usually results in small terriitories due to large fighting all over the board. And thats of course, pretty much only a tactical matter. Or you could say: "Who's best at missing things" :/

I'll do my best though - here we go!

P.S. I ended the review at move 182.];B[qd];W[pp];B[dp]C[Yukontodd [8k?\]: Ooo.  I haven't played cross corner for ages.  Fun.:)
Andyka [9k\]: haha];W[dc]LB[de:A]C[###
At your level, its not really that important, but now B has a nice approach at A, working with his star point.
If your komoku faced the other way, B wouldnt be so happy.]

(;W[od]C[I wasn't sure how to handle c17, so I, um, treated d17 lightly and tried another approach.

This is certainly possible..
Though once you played D17 it feels you should continue the joseki first. (see var)

Or after D15 you might approach at P16 imediatelly.];B[oc];W[nc]

Now B has an ideal formation (triangled) with his three stones, working with his star-point.
You, however, still have a weakness at A.

if the basic joseki was played youd be a lot better. (see var)]

You should carefully watch the e8 group, as b is getting very strong around it.

Now your weakness at A is gone.];W[pq];B[on]C[Okay, I think maybe I put it off too long.  Maybe I should have jumped out from that bottom group right away?

###
It was good to treat them lightly.
With this kind of stones, you might even think about sacrificing them somehow.

If B takes the three stones you give him, you get the center.
If B doesnt want to accept your sacrifice, you escape.
So its kind of flexible.

I went trough some analyzing (the game tree got massive xD) of sacrificing starting with J10. J10 is not the only move of course. It shows the idea though. You can use something similar..

or of course you can just run away, as you did, which is perfectly fine.]

Things fell apart here for a while, though I didn't realise how badly until I reviewed the game later.  I think my counting was off (like usual), k12 seems to have cost me around 50 points, except that I got lucky later on.

###
Its not such a big loss, only about 30 i guess.

;W[kk]LB[dc:A][od:B][qi:E][cm:C][jp:F][oq:D]C[There it is.  With all my mistakes, white's game is saved by an overlooked snapback.  I lost that group earlier, I missed killing the group on the right, and those are the reasons I wonder how I played the game.  Was I doing well in the beginning, I felt like I was dominating, the stones just seemed to flow into something that looked, well, like white should win if he didn't do something stupid.  The fuseki and the early middle-game, not this blip, is really what I'm interested in.  So many mistakes later on in my game, I'm not sure I'm doing as well as it feels like I am in the early game.  I hope that makes sense, that you know what I mean.

After this, I knew I'd won (thought I thought I'd won by more than I had), so the yose is pretty dry for the most part, though I know I missed at least four or five easy points along the way.  My commentary ends here.
Thank you!

###
Ok, done. :)

All in all, a nice game for an KGS 8k. It might also be that the diagonal opening doesnt really allow much strategical space..
Black also made some serious blunders (ie the snap-back, the upper-right corner..).
Anyway, i hope i didnt overanalyze things xD

Certainly work on keeping your attention troughout the game. Pause at important moments, and think carefully. And always read! (at least 2, 3 moves ahead). Make it a habit, so that when you look at the board, the variations just flow through your head like a spring of water :)

As for the early stages, either

a) play the joseki in the A corner - and if you dont know the joseki, read something out for yourself - "Meijin doesnt need joseki" is the proverb, right? :) Pros dont play joseki because theyre written somewhere, but because they read them out. You CAN do that too. It works because your opponent is not a pro either :P

b) ..dont play the joseki and approach at B right away.

The group at C was weaker than it looked. Not that weak but as the black walls around it got stronger, its future was getting uncertain :o

the D joseki is used in special circumstances, and shoul be unlearned!

and E wasnt that hard to read out, anyway the connection was essential.

F was not good. :(

In the center, think about the whole board. Sometimes sacrificing can be a strong technique.

If you have any questions, write me on KGS - nick is JanBwinda and im online almost every day.
I like teaching a lot so dont worry it would bother me.

In the endgame you might have lost some points but only a few.

Here P3 is used. It takes away whites base.
B doesnt mind the weakness in the corner at A, because W doesnt have time to play there.
His group is weak and has to run away first. If W now plays A, B separates the two groups and W is in further trouble.

Thats the theory. While he kick (P3) in a situation when W is not pincered is only helping W, this is a special situation.]
