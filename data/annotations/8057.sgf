C[hi there. my name is Rudy. i'm here playing as white. i think this game is one of the most exciting i ever have.
i really want to know what i suppose to do or prioritize first. or what mistake or interesting move me or my opponent have.
i love this game, nowadays i keep doing mistake, so my rank drop to 23k.
and one more thing, i really dont know the term that everybody use in this game. so if u really lazy to explain what the word mean, then u can attach a link or smth.
please frop any comments as you please. perhaps i cant see what u are seeing.
lastly, thank you very much for whoever reviewing this game. i really appriciate ur comment and ur time.
^_^
<oslito> Hi, my name is Marcin and I will try to give you some comments :)
For any vocabulary refer to http://senseis.xmp.net/ :)
Comments end at move 37 (with short explenation).
Keep enjoying the greatest game at the world ;\]

Marcin];B[pd];W[dp];B[qj]C[is this move (no 3) is a bit too safe? or it doesnt matter?
<oslito> There is a rule: <First corners, then sides, then center>, which is caused by factt that its fastest to get points in corners. So, playing in one of the corners would give you more points than this.]
;W[dd]LB[cc:A][cq:B]C[i really like to place the stone at the star. but i learn that one of my enemy place always see this as weakness, and he always put his stone on A or B. is this really weakness? because his stone always live. and i found it hard to kill it.
<oslito> Normally its imposibble to kill opponent stone, but anyway in such early stage of game it gives more influence to white than points to black - I will show the joseki sequence in variation.
For easy joseki dictionary refer to: http://www.turbogo.com/text/jostutor.html :)]
(;B[cj]C[<oslito> Seems bad for: 
Its gote (doesn't push opponent to response) 
 AND 
Its smaller than playing in last open corner.];W[ch]C[is my approach here correct?

<oslito> As C10 was gote c12 was not required - it was better to play in right low corner.]
(;B[dl]LB[ej:A][cm:B]C[for black, is it really good to move this way? i prefer to move at A or B. is that right?
<oslito> It was better to play B7 or (more agresive) C6, because now the black group is open from bottom.
Move A is]
(;W[cm]TR[dl]C[alright, i think it is a bit risky. because my white stone can be cut. what do u think?
<oslito> Touching opponent group kame it stronger, so it's wrong.]
;B[pp]C[
<oslito> Better late than never ;\]];W[nq]C[it this too deep? where should i put it then?
<oslito>No, its standard approach. Refer to josekis at http://www.turbogo.com/text/jostutor.html]
;B[jq]LB[no:A]TR[qn][lq][qq]C[this move always make me scared about my white stone will live or not. because this move is intended to cut and isolate O3. what should i do? ussually my next move is on A
<oslito> You have also potions to play at marked places or (because K3 should be played at L3 or M3) tenuki (play in other area)]
;W[no];B[pn]TR[qj][qn]C[<oslito> Normally Q6 would be wrong (R6 better), but in this situation its good thanks to stone at R10.]
;W[nc];B[jc]C[
<oslito> Again, K17 does'n put real pressure at O17, so can be ignored.]
(;W[me]C[haha. a bit variation. but is this correct?
<oslito>I depends if the connection is cutable in this particular situation - see varations as example;\]
You cannot say "its good response" or "it's wrong response" until you read it to the end.
It can be, at our level, quite impossible.
But you can say - "usually white in such situations plays here or here", so it's good to watch professional games: http://9-dan.com/ or strong amatours' games: http://gosensations.com/ to get some feeling and intuition how to play.]
(;B[of];W[hc]TR[dc][qc][je][qf][gq]C[this way i try to cut K17. i think my weakness is try to cut too far, ended with relatively weak groups scatered.
<oslito> You cannot get all by playing single stone - you have to choose: safety or risky gain, development or fight, territory at the side or in the corner, go is a game of choices.
It's important to define what is possible:
- Attack black's stone from the side (as you have done)
- Push down K17 stone from the top (by playing K15 for example)
- Invading  R17 corner
- Invading at R14
- protecting corner with play D17
- playing tenuki.
Then, you try to imagine whole-board situation after sequence started from each of the moves, and based on this - choice right. 
It's great if you can move that gives you few functions (development and reducing for example).]
;B[fd];W[fc]C[is my approach correct?
<oslito> It seems good for me.];B[md];W[nd]C[i think this is where the mistake shown. i can easily be cut by black. so i think the horse move (N15) is bad.
<oslito>black started from wrong side - N16 can be easily catched in ladder, which should be possible to read up.]
(;B[cg]C[
<oslito>Balck plays so agrresive ;\]]
(;W[dg]C[i try to connect the weak group(C12) to the upper stable group (D16). should i just try to make point in the centre area?]
;B[bh];W[cf];B[bg];W[dh]C[
<oslito> Black is happy to protect his group with sente to play at bottom ;\]]
;B[gr]TR[fq][gq]C[
<oslito> But G2 is definitely not good: 
Forth line is line of influence
Third line is line of territory
Second line is line of defeat

So black should play at G3 or (to possibly start fight) at F3]
;W[cl]
(;B[bk]C[
<oslito>Wrong - it's important to try to keep connections between stones, and to not get isolated
.];W[ck]
(;B[dr]C[
<oslito> 
1: again 2nd line - wrong
2: It was important to prevent from being isolated at the side.]
;W[cq];B[eq]
(;W[pq]C[
<oslito> White should use blacks mistake to play at  D1
