;B[pd]C[S: I play as black side (shogun1234).];W[dp]C[shogun1234 [6k\]: hi]
;B[dd]C[kty [5k\]: hi];W[qo];B[jq];W[gq];B[mq];W[pq]C[N: This line of play seems a little passive. White is happy to make a shimari in the corner.]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[ck];W[fc];B[ic];W[df];B[ee];W[cd]C[S: Q: Does black play C17 would be better? For instance, black C17, white C15, black D17, white C11. Then black can take the point around Q10

I think D15 only help the white to make his compound more councrete. Also, black C14, the cutting too rush at that moment.

N: You are right in your analysis, C17 would be a better move.]

(;B[de]TR[dd][ee]C[N: You should be suspicious of this move because it makes an empty triangle. Sometimes the empty triangle is the only choice in fighting, but here there are much better moves. This really only helps W.]

(;W[ji]C[S: I think white should excape L9 first because at least it cuts the connection of the black side. Or at least survive the white side (that has been closed) due to it has die or live problem. however, I have no idea what moves to take for the following actions would be better. Would you please to give some recommandation?]
;B[kk];W[kh]
(;B[ie]C[S: This move i think does play well. however, i consider the weak point at H13. I do not want to connect it at G13 or H13, which in my opinion is too slow. So I put the stone on J15. But after review it myself, I think it only helps the white to capture the upper side territory. It is not good for the black.

Is there any better move that can eliminate the problem of H13 and keep attacking simulateously?

N: I too think that J15 is a bad move, because it strengthens white. See my ideas in the variations.]

;W[nk];B[lm];W[mo];B[lp]C[N: What are you aiming for here? I don't think W has to respond here. You are just splitting two live groups.]

(;B[qi];W[pi];B[ph];W[oi];B[qj];W[qk];B[hg]C[S: Fianlly I connect at point H13, but another weak point at R12 appears. I am not satisfied with this. But due to constraint to my ability I have no idea what to do would be better. Would you please to give suggestions.

In addtion, I think  to invade at M17 might works but no idea whether it would hurt the connection from K14 to P14. I consider to attach the middle part of white, but seeming there is no better way. What should I do would help myself increase my terrotory or reduce my opponent. Thanks.

N: Because of the big kill on the left, Black is ahead. So all you need to do now is to play a reasonable endgame and you win easily. Just play normal safe moves that reduce the W territorry.]

I think there should have methods to kill the eyes of the black, however, I can't find one that definitvely can kill the black. Maybe the white should not play at N7. would you please to tell me the variant attacking (white to black) here? Thank you.

kty [5k\]: thx

N: This is obviously a big mistake for W that finishes the game for sure. But even if W plays better, B is ahead.

In general I think that the time limits were a little fast in this game and both missed some chances for better reading, for example you never played the cut at C17, and you both didn't read well when it came to killing the big white group. Maybe next time choose a slower game? Anyway, if you have any more questions about the game, feel free to contact me.]
