C[This game was between Nori[20k) and Gumpstuck[21k?\]. Please comment, thank you.

Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I will be your reviewer for this game.  I note that you said you thought it was an even game, yet you won by ~35 points.  One of the things this implies, and the game certainly bore out, is a difficulty in finding the big points on the board.  Both players took an inordinately long time to play in the bottom left.

You may also want to take some time during your games to try to make a rough estimate of the score to figure out whether you're ahead or behind.]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[cf];W[oc];B[po]TR[oc][qd]C[Ted: You may want to respond to White's shimari around Q10 or R10; if you let White play there it's a nice amount of territory for White.]
;W[pj];B[cc]C[What's wrong with my opening? I seem to be wasting alot of territory.

Ted: I don't think you've wasted much territory so far, except that I don't particularly like this move.  You've already got a stone in that corner and don't need to play another one until White responds.  At least, you don't need to play one there as long as there are big points to play elsewhere on the board.  Here, I would play either around K4, or around K17.]
;W[cd];B[bd]C[Ted: I think you should have played at D17 here instead.]
;W[be]
(;B[dc]C[Ted: I think you should have played at B17 and taken the corner immediately.  By playing out the whole sequence, you gave up quite a bit of territory too early in the game.]

;W[fd];B[gd];W[ge];B[he];W[gf];B[jd];W[dj]C[Ted: You have a relatively small amount of territory at the top, while White has taken quite a bit more on the left side.]
;B[gh];W[eh];B[hf];W[gg];B[hg];W[fh];B[md]C[Ted: Your wall doesn't do much because of the White stones on the right side.]
;W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[mc];B[kd];W[nd];B[pf]C[Ted: I don't think this invasion is the best idea.  White simply ignores it with his next move, and the stone at Q10 isn't weakened that much even if you play something like R11.]

C[Ted: I think the groups on the side can now be left alone for the time being.  The two big areas are the bottom, and the right side.  White should have played something like F3 next.]
;W[kf];B[lf]C[Ted: You didn'e need to respond to this, and should have taken one of the big points.]

;B[pn];W[pm];B[om];W[ol]
(;B[nm]C[Ted: You should have played R7 instead.  See the variations.]
;W[ql];B[no];W[nl];B[nn]C[Ted: Bad move.  You should have extended to N7 instead.]
;W[kl]C[Ted: One more chance for White to take the big points in the bottom left, but he finally leaves them for you.]
;B[hq]C[Ted: This is a good move, in that the bottom is the one big area left on the board.]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[fp];B[cn]C[Ted: I'm not so sure I like this move.  I don't know if you want to let White turn down to F3.  Letting White play E3 might be even worse for you.]

(;W[en];B[dl];W[hj];B[hn];W[gk];B[cj];W[ci];B[bj];W[bi];B[ck]
;W[dk]C[Right now I'm thinking of capturing the LR... possible?

Ted: You can probably capture the two stones at F4 and G4, but because White can play either E8 or G7 next, you probably can't capture everything.

More importantly, however, is the question of how much you need to capture.  If you look at the board, White's allowing you to reduce him on the left has left him with:

~25 on the left
~15 in the top right
~15 at the right.  Add captured stones and komi, and White's got about 60.

Black has:

~25 in the top half
~25 on the left even if White gets to play E3
~40 in the bottom right.

The correct strategy here is to consolidate your territory.]

(;B[el];W[gm];B[gn];W[fn]C[Ted: White should have played F7, not F6, keeping more stones connected.]
;B[jp]C[Ted: If you wanted to capture the stones in the lower left, you should have cut White at F7.]

Ted: No, you didn't lose much territory.  You were only going to get about 10 points maximum on the right; in the actual game you end up with about 5.  Besides, the game is won already.]
