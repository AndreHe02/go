RE[W+Resign]
TM[900]

C[Tim: Hi, I've reviewed your game. Hope my comments are helpful.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[cd];B[pk]LB[qk:A][qo:B]C[I think this is one of the Chinese Openings.

Tim: Yes, the other spot is A. The idea behind the Chinese Opneing is to lay 
claim to a large area, almost forcing your opponent to invade. When he does 
you counterattack, gaining power and territory while attacking. If you 
simply wanted to secure territory, B would do the job.];W[ec]

(;B[co]LB[jp:A][jd:B]C[I should either approach, or take a big point. I 
chose to approach. I don't know why though.

Tim: In opening theory, making an approach move is generally the same value 
as making a shimari.
With your three stones along one side, a move towards A or B is an good 
development, that works well with your stones already on the board, and 
works with the idea of the Chinese Opening to build a very large potential 
moyo your opponent must invade.];W[fp];B[cl];W[ip]
(;B[qo]LB[mp:A]C[I closed the corner because... My opponent did.

Tim: In the spirit of the Chinese Opening it's better to take a spot like A. 
This not only marks out territory on the bottom, but also moves towards the 
three white stones and stops their advance along the side.
If you play A your stones are strong and a white invasion can benefit you, 
see variation.];W[jd];B[kq]C[Here, I expected the opponent to descend to J3. Then I would move at 
N4 or somewhere near there.

Tim: It was a nice thought, but opponents aren't always so obedient ;)
If you want N4 you can just take it directly now since it works nicely with 
your shimari. Otherwise, at L3, you leave enough room on the other side for 
your opponent to pincer you, which he did.];W[mp];B[mq]LB[ko:A]
C[I thought that this would be a strong response that would 
get territory.

Tim: Reponding at A is stronger. It divides white and stops him from gaining 
power towards the centre. You are only gaining a few points of territory 
along the edge.];W[jq];B[lp];W[kp];B[ko];W[jp];B[mo];W[kr];B[lq]
;W[pm]C[Note for the next sequence: I thought I could kill the group since 
it was in the middle of alot of black stones... So I tried.

Tim: As you noted yourself later, you could have killed the group.]
;B[nl];W[nm];B[mm];W[ok];B[ol];W[pl];B[oj]LB[oj:A][ok:B]C[I think that this move would be better at R9.

Tim: yes, R9 would kill the white stones. You should be able to see that the 
ladder beginning with A doesn't work and white's B stone can escape. This 
also allows white to play R9 in sente.
You don't need to kill every white stone. A move at R9 would give you a 
territory of 40-50 points in the corner  and you would be in great shape.]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[qj];B[om];W[qn];B[po];W[ro];B[qm];W[rm];B[pn]
;W[ql];B[qc]TR[oj][pj]MA[ok]LB[qf:A][nc:B][qi:1][rp:2][ci:3]
C[Again, I wanted 
territory. In general, I think I play too close, and I don't even try to 
invade an opponent's area.

Tim: This move secures the territory, but it is small and white can still 
attack you from both sides. If you really want the corner now, moves like A 
or B also begin to mark territory but are more flexible, and could later be 
used with the triangled stones to create a large area towards the centre.
The stone at Q16 is lonely, but not dead. If white attacks it you will make 
joseki and live easily.
You still need to be ready for white's X stone to escape and start to 
surround your triangle stones. A move like 1 starts to mark territory on the 
side, slows white's advance along the side, and may be handy if white X does 
escape.
A move at 2 secures a big corner for you, otherwise white can easily jump in 
and steal it.
A move around 3 helps your two stones on that side. Imagine a white stone 
there instead.
Save moves like R17 for when the corner is threatened and and you need to 
make life quickly.];W[hc];B[bq];W[fn];B[jj]MA[oj][nl][mm][ko]
LB[rp:1][mc:2][qg:3][ch:4]C[I didn't know where to 
go, so I just took the center point.

Tim: You have built a wall with the X stones, so this move isn't terrible 
since it builds territory in the centre, though it's vulnerable to attack.
Moves like 1, sescuring the corner, 2 or 3, building strength in the other 
corner, or 4, developing your side group are other possibilities.
White has only three groups, but none are weak, so attacking them isn't 
worthwhile at this point. The next best plan is to grab the biggest points 
or those that make your own groups stronger.];W[jl];B[qi];W[pf]
;B[ph]C[I wanted to make sure white couldn't connect to the R8 group. I 
think that a follow-up at S11 would be good.];W[oe];B[nc];W[ng]
;B[dg]MA[ci][ch]C[Overplay. Again, I didn't know where to go. I figured that 
since an ideal extension for white would be at D13 (because of the 
shimari)... So I took this move.

Tim; Your opponent's ideal move is often yours as well. In this case the 
move is too close to his strength. It needed to be closer to your three 
stones on the side, maybe C11 or 12.];W[ch];B[dh];W[ci];B[di]

[lr:7]C[I 
thought that at this point, the game could be even (I'm not good at 
counting). My plan was to prevent white from getting any territory in the 
center.

Tim: An easy way to calculate is to count those areas you should be able to 
hold onto and ignore those up for grabs. I've marked your territory with Xs, 
and your opponent's with triangles. If I've counted right, that gives you 54 
and your opponent 61.
This is only an estimate, of course, but the game looks fairly even.

the game will be decided by who gets to play the last big engame moves, and 
who gets the centre.
Keeping that in mind, moves like 1 to 7 claim territory for you and deny it 
to your opponent. Those are the best kind of endgame moves.]
;W[lc]C[I think this was huge.

Tim: It was a big point, but there are still others. Just grab one of those 
others I showed you];B[jo];W[in];B[km];W[kl];B[ll];W[hf];B[hk]
MA[rp][cr][fe]C[Tim: This is a small move, You can't damage white's 
bottom territory very much, but the centre is still open, as are areas near 
the corners. Any of the Xs are better];W[ee]C[Tim: White is now building a huge territory on the side. The game is 
slipping away from you];B[gj];W[hl];B[il]MA[ff][kf][qf][rp]
[cr]C[Tim: This move is also small. You can't really 
damage white, and are losing the chance to play one of the larger X moves. 
You are bulding a nice wall, but white is claiming all the territory above 
it.];W[ik];B[ij];W[im];B[jk];W[qq]C[Tim: White has now grabbed the corner from you. This is a swing of 
about 20 points (10 less for you, 10 more for him)];B[qp];W[rq]
;B[pr];W[ri];B[rh];W[qg];B[qh];W[si];B[il];W[lf]C[At this point, I thought it was pointless to continue.

Tim: Yes, by this point you are in big trouble. You were even going into the 
endgame, but let white take all of the large points. If you had split these 
points it could have been anyone's game.

Some final advice:
- Be careful not to get involved in small local fights and miss making large 
plays on other parts of the board.
- Study some endgame moves. This game could have been yours if you had 
played the endgame differently.
- study some fuseki and joseki for the opening so you get an understanding 
of the best directions to attack an opponet from. In general, is is best to 
make moves that expand your territoy while taking away potential territory 
from your opponent.
- Don't worry about making deffinite territory in the opening. Sometimes it 
is good to exchange territory for power on the outside that you can use to 
claim more territory later.

Hope my review was useful,
Tim])
(;B[mp];W[po];B[qp]C[Tim: White is forced to live small or run to the centre where you 
can chase him.]))
(;B[jp];W[dk];B[jd]LB[jp:A][dk:B][jd:C]C[Tim: For example, if you play A, white can play 
near B, or make a shimari with D3, let's say, then you can take the big 
point around C. You are already putting pressure on white because of the 
large moyo you're building. White will be forced to invade and you can 
countetattack. That is the idea behind the Chinese Opening.]
