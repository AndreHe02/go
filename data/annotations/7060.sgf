C[A:
Hello, I am Amygdala and will do the requested review for you. It could have been  tailored more properly to meet your individual needs if you had presented specific questions concerning the appropriate parts of the game. For the next time you will send in a kifu, I suggest that you rather prepare it in such a fashion... Anyway, I will do my best. Henceforth, I will mark my comments with "A:".]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[do]LB[oc:1][od:3][de:2]C[A:
Your move is quite well, but most professionals prefer the moves 1-3 in that fuseki.]
;W[dl];B[fo];W[gq];B[ce]LB[ho:A][cq:B]C[A:
It feels strange to let further moves of the joseki in the lower left unplayed. I would go on with A or B.]
;W[dh]
(;B[ee];W[fd];B[ff];W[ej]C[A:
The black sequence looks a little slowish, and white manages to protect his defect. See variation for e15 for a more dynamic alternative.]
;B[qo];W[nd];B[oe];W[ne];B[of];W[jd];B[ld]LB[pj:A]C[A:
Seems overagressive and too early. White could just play m15. I would prefer the calm move at A.]

(;W[oc];B[mg]C[A:
Nice, as it threatens to link up the m16 stone and extends the moyo below!]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pd];B[qe];W[pe];B[pf];W[pc];B[lf];W[rb];B[sd]
LB[qf:A]C[A:
Better at A immediately, as White can immediately cut here with a good result.]

(;B[pj]C[A:
Never use a wall to make territory! Use it rather to attack. Q10 ist too close to your upper wall. Instead...]
;W[nm];B[no];W[nj];B[ql]LB[iq:A]C[A:
This one could have been left for the endgame. Still I would prefer A.]
;W[rn]
(;B[ko]C[A:
This one does not create a proper moyo, as the lower side is still open to the left; and it does hardly attack the white invasion group on top, as this group is still quite flexible.]
;W[jq];B[lq]LB[lj:A]C[A:
Too small and too passive. As white did not answer to l5, black should attack the white stones above as strongly as possible, e.g. with A.]

There is absolutely no need to play there now! I still advocate A!]

Hard for black to lose the triangled stones... A very big loss.]

Finally, here we go!];W[ro];B[rp]C[Gano [4k\]: I dunno.  Looks like it would've been a troublesome ko.]

Strange. Black is strong all around. Therefore he can afford to push from the outside and just prevent two eyes for white.]

The resignation is the right decision.

I liked the game, it was already quite well played! You will probably improve quickly.

Here three hints for further studies:

1. You could have done much better with the josekis in both left corners. Try to understand joseki better. To achieve that, try out any collection like "MasterGo" or  "Kombilo", look up all josekis from your games in a Joseki-Collection like Ishida's or any of the like. Do not learn josekis by rote, try to UNDERSTAND them.

2. Try to play moves with many meanings at the same time. If you are tempted to play a purely defensive move, think twice and try to find one that defends while attacking...

3. The weak white group on the right side was left untouched until the end, and then you just did not kill it. Therefore, try out a more aggressive style of playing. If there is a weak group, attack it without hesitation!

If any of these hints really helped you to improve, let me know!]

This leaves white in bad shape and creates a nice moyo along the lower edge. Difficulties, however, will arise from the fact that you have not yet settled the two triangled stones to the left, as you had not finished the joseki there...]
