Hello, my name is Simon. This is the first game that I am reviewing for someone else so I hope it is of some use to you. If you have any questions you can email me at simon@thornewill.org My KGS name is Ethelor.

Since 9x9 games focus mainly on tactics and fighting ill try to point out alternative moves to ones that you have chosen. Please note that "attack and defence" on a 9x9 board is not the same as attack and defence on the 19x19 board. This is because on a 9x9 board there is a lot more contact play.
___
Hello! Thank you for reviewing my game. At this point I'm very uncomfortable with attack and defense. I made an effort to be more aggressive in this game, and I'd appreciate advice on how to evaluate when to cut vs when to back off peacefully.]
PL[W];W[fg]
(;B[ef]C[S.

This move looks good intuitively sealing off white and giving yourself the influence you need for the rest of the board. However, it is a mistake. 

See the next move];W[ff]TR[ef][fg][gg]C[S.

If you observe the marked stones you will see a certain shape.

It is a knights move by black which white has pushed through completely

This is very bad shape and one that is best to avoid, hence why the hane would have been a better choice.]
;B[fe]C[S.

You can see how this shape could be bad. It is quite difficult to deal with white afterward.

The best antidote is often prevention.];W[ge]
(;B[gd]LB[gf:A]C[S.
While it is true what black has a lot of weakness white also has a lot of weakness.

You have to understand that which has to play serious overplays in order to survive this game as it stands black is still completely dominating white.

Cutting white off would be very painful.
____
Up to here I'm simply trying to keep white enclosed. My shape has a lot of weaknesses, so I didn't feel comfortable playing the cut at G4.]
;W[ee]C[S.

White takes the initiative and continues to be agressive in order to even the game out]
;B[fd];W[df]
(;B[de]C[S.

A reasonable approach but you can also use the stone to put white under some pressure

You do not have to be timid. It is a 9x9 game, fight to your hearts content and you will learn how to fight. If you practice fighting you will learn when you should and when you shouldnt fight

See the tree I have posted below. Black has many tricks he can do
___
Here I decided to cut rather than extend at E3, planning to seal white off at E8 if white captures at E3.]
;W[eg];B[ed];W[ce]C[S.

This is a good move by white. He gains nothing by connecting because once you take the stone you just put in atari there isnt much you can do after but connect yourself.

White has bigger things to worry about]
(;B[cf]C[I felt strong in the upper left and so used the cut to also strengthen my lower corner.]
;W[dd]C[S.

White is burning a hole right through you though, its best not to let have white the ponnuki (deathstar)

He has split you and now he has gained the foothold required to attack]
;B[dc];W[bd];B[cd]LB[dd:A]TR[gc][fd][gd]SQ[cc][dc]C[S.

I would like to point out that the square marked shape is not an empty triangle because the triangle surrounds a white stone. The shape is fine.

The triangle marked shape is an empty triangle because it surrounds an empty moku (point)

Even if white does connect the cut at B5 isnt that painful for white

It does help black to seal off some areas through

H5 is too nice cut at G4 and kill the stone like it deserves
___
On review, I'm not sure about this play. I assumed white would connect at D5, giving me a free cut at B5. But obviously the empty triangle is bad shape in general. Other options that came to mind upon review were H5, expanding my territory on the right and potentially saving the G3 stone, and playing something like D2 to help the lower left group.]

(;W[be];B[de];W[gh];B[ef]C[During the game, I kept expecting white to connect one of the pennukis and stop the ko fight, but since white never did I used the ataris to extend my live group into the center. I felt that taking away white's center territory points would make up for losing the lower side, since I did not expect to make much territory there anyway.]
;W[dg];B[ee]C[S.

That wasnt a terrific exchange for white. That is correct. Computers tend to mess up when fighting.]
;W[ch]
(;B[he]C[Playing on this side because it would extend my territory. I did not see a way to win a capturing race with the left side group of 2 vs white's 3.
___

S.

Not after g3, thats correct

That extra liberty was crucial];W[gf];B[hg];W[hf];B[if]LB[hd:A]
C[S.

There is a problem with connecting underneath, its the cut at A]

(;W[hh]C[S.

There is a proverb, Sacrifice small to save big

The best thing is to read out the result and if continueing hurts you then let go

Right now connecting only hurts you so fix your shape and move on]

(;B[ig];W[ih];B[ie];W[hd]C[S.

This is a mistake that a lot of players at your level will make. Keep an eye out for it and mabye you can do this to someone else.]
;B[hc]C[S.

You are correct, once again the AI is not perfect. However it probably thought that by keeping sente it could make up the points it would "lose" by playing somewhere else.
____
Unless I missed something, shouldn't my right group be cut and dead? The AI didn't capture with the next move and I don't know why. I also don't know at what point I needed to change my play in order to keep this group attached and thus alive.]
;W[bc];B[id];W[dh];B[bb];W[ac]
(;B[cb]C[S.

Too timid];W[ab];B[ba];W[fh]

TB[ca][da][ea][fa][ga][ha][ia][db][eb][fb][gb][hb][ec][fc][ic]
[dd][hd]C[S.

Overall I would say that black lost because he was very timid in playing against white. White playing a handicap game white has to be very agressive in order to even out the score. This means that if black wants to win he should seek out whites mistakes and punishing them.

You will get a sense of how to punish white by simply playing and reviewing your games yourself as well as sending your games out for review.

In addition to being too nice you also should work on keeping yourself connected. The two stones in the lower left hand corner and the ones that white didnt want to capture both had chances to live very happily if you would have payed more attention to them. You did a little bit but forgot about it.

Just keep playing and you will improve. Make sure to email or message me if you have any further questions. :)]

Choose a side to counter atari I would say A because that side is weaker]
;B[bg];W[ae]LB[gf:A][dg:B]SQ[ff][eg][fg]C[S.

A is a very big point if you follow up with B the square shape becomes a false eye

Though black is not able to kill due to shortage of liberties at g3 stone

maybe try to kill G5 instead?];B[gf];W[he];B[dg];W[dh];B[ch]

;B[ae];W[af];B[ad];W[cd];B[dd];W[bf];B[bb];W[ah]C[S.

White lives with 2 points, doesnt matter at all. Meanwhile black has control over most of the board.]
)))))
(;B[gf]C[S.

Ofcourse this leads to a fight.

Its difficult to forsee the outcome of fights so often we say that the fight will "favor" one side.

This side has a higher chance to come out of the fight victorious.

When reviewing a game you usualy cannot know the outcome of a fight because there are multiple routes for both sides that can be taken. Mistakes have to be taken into consideration as well.

So just because a fight favors one side it does not follow that said side will win.]
;W[ee];B[fd];W[df];B[eg];W[fh]C[S.

White takes a rather agressive approach here which also leaves him full with weakness

The more agressive the weaker the shape and vice versa];B[de]
;W[ed];B[cf]C[S.

Black has nothing to fear];W[dd];B[ce];W[fc];B[gd];W[he]SQ[gf]
[gg]C[S.

The marked black group seems to be in trouble but I would say that black should be happy with giving them up]

It would be better to hane.

Hane is the normal responce to a touching move (tskuke)]))
