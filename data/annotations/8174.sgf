C[Hello reviewer!
I played black in this game.

I'm most interested in the opening, bigger moves; I'd also like some fighting advice. I've written my questions through the game.

Thank you for your time and help!

C: Hi,
I hope I'm able to help you with my comments. They'll be prefixed by a "C:" always.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]LB[fq:A][fc:B][oc:C][cj:D]C[I was actually already stumped at this point as for the best continuation.,

C: It's really difficult to say which move is the best one at this point because there are just to much possibilities. A-D are moves I would consider.]
;B[oc]C[so this was my guess

C: It's a possibility but only one of many. Maybe you should read some books or in sensei about the differences between this book. A big opening theory is to big for a review ;)]
N[P17 Comment];W[qi];B[fq]C[is this reasonable? or does r11 demand a response?

C: My instinct tells me to play R9 and its often played because it becomes to easy for white to settle in front of your shimari if you don't respond. However, tennuki is nearly always an option if you get enough so let's judge this later.]
;W[qo]
(;B[op]LB[ql:A]C[again, unsure about this. I wanted to help the far extending stone and also have the capacity to hassle white's long extension.

C: A seems very vital for white because it's a good shape from two unsettled stones.]
;W[qq]
(;B[jp]C[C: This makes it to easy for W. If a opponent touched one of your stones you should think more than twice whether it's good to tennuki.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[pp];B[oq];W[oo]TR[pp][qo][qq]C[C: This is a really good shape for W which helps R11. See Variation at W R3.]
;B[no];W[on]C[is this result okay for black? was it okay to leave this area with my next move?

C: This result is bad for B. W got a corner and the distance between R11 and the corner group looks nice now. This is exactly what W dreamed for. In exchange B got a little bit overconcentrated wall and a couple of points at the side. B has to get a lot from the fact that W ignored F3 now.]
;B[cn];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[do];B[cq]C[not sure about this move]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[go];B[hp];W[cp];B[bq]C[C: I guess W can gain more here but in my opinion W is still a little bit ahead.]
;W[nn];B[mo];W[ko]C[C: I wouldn't like a passive move here because this is what W wants. Besides F4 is still unsettled and W shouldn't create another weak group next to this group.]
N[L5 Comment]
(;B[kp];W[lo];B[lp]C[was the sequence from 28-37 too submissive?]
;W[mn];B[in];W[km]
(;B[bp]C[i regretted this move once I made it...I thought D10 or D8 might have been better

C: What about attacking the group a little bit ? Currently it has 0 eyes and there is no way at B4 to build one.]
;W[em];B[dl];W[dm];B[cm];W[cl];B[ck];W[el];B[dk];W[ch];B[jd]
LB[fc:A][qg:B][pj:C]C[curious about what else I could have done at this point

C: I guess I would have played this too. Other points I would consider are A, B and C. A to play more active, B to develop your shimari and C to reduce W's territory.]
;W[hm]
(;B[oi]C[I wanted to deflate white's thickness. Was this an okay spot?

C: I Would prefer Q10 because P11 leaves more good possibilities for W.]
;W[qf];B[of];W[og];B[ng];W[oh];B[nh];W[ni];B[qg]C[I think this was a mistake by me

C: Yes it was because P11 is easy to catch for W.];W[oj];B[mi]
;W[pi];B[lh]C[i'm never sure about these shape-correcting moves

N14 defends both cuts, but I was thinking M12 would let me play o10 and end up with a good shape

C: I think you're right here. If B would cut at O14 directly you shouldn't have to much problems to deal with this stones. On the other hand N10 would be a very big move for W if M12 wouldn't be there.]
;W[pe];B[pf]C[was this a mistake?

C: This was a mistake from W.];W[pg];B[qe];W[kf]C[this move didn't seem very threatening to me

C: He wants to reduce your points here. However, something like H16 is bigger.]
;B[mf];W[kd]
(;B[jc]C[curious about alternatives

C: I'll try to find some variations. However, I didn't thought about every possibility here so there might be mistakes.]
;W[je];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[me];B[md]C[tesuji? or nonsense? :)

C: I'm only able to find good results for W ;) If there is anything you see for B don't hesitate to ask.]
(;W[df];B[ff]C[this move, and the next few, were me hoping to do something with white's two unsettled groups in the center.

I think there must be better spots than the ones I chose.

C: I like this move. Currently L16 is the weakest group and it hasn't that much potential eyespace. Therefore you have t make sure the Group doesn't connect without giving him much possibilities to fight. This is a nice move to achieve this in my opinion. Besides you have to force him into the direction of his second group if you want to start a succesful double attack.]
;W[jh]
(;B[jk]C[C: With this move you gave him to much space. One point closer is possible.]
;W[ge];B[fe];W[hh];B[hk];W[im];B[ml]C[this was attempting to threaten to cut at m7..

C: Well, here you were simply outread by our opponnent.];W[mj]
;B[lj];W[mk];B[ll];W[lk];B[kl];W[kj]C[and at this point I tried to complete that cut..]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[lm];W[kn]C[and suddently realized my stones were cut off!!! if I cut, I'd be captured..so I ran away

C: There is not much to say other than you forgot to forsee one variation. Sadly this happens to often to everybody ;)]
;B[ek];W[fk];B[fj];W[gk];B[gj];W[hj]C[it looked pretty hopeless at this point.]

;W[ik];B[gh]C[but I'm out! was I lucky? or were those moves okay?]
;W[ig];B[hg];W[ne];B[nf];W[id];B[kc];W[ld];B[lc]C[this is the beginning of a fight that finished the game.  I only barely won, and I expect I made a number of mistakes along the way.

White resigned immediately after.];W[hf];B[gf];W[nd];B[mc];W[nc]

;B[qb];W[ha];B[oe]C[white resigned here

C: Your weaknesses are the correct direction in the opening and the correct moves to attack. I'm not sure wether you understand that "Attacking" doesn't means "Killing" but to think about this fact might be helpful for you.

I hope the review was helpful. If you still have questions please ask me (Via e-mail or "Celebrir" at KGS)

Everyone who reads this review: Have fun and a lot of good games :)
