AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hello Reviewer,

I'm black in this game and lost the game by 8.5 points.
I want you to show me my mistakes and improvement points.

Thanks in advance for your comment.];W[qo];B[jq];W[qf];B[nc]
;W[cj];B[cl]LB[cg:B][ch:A][qi:C][pq:D]C[reid: Hello milamber.

This feels like the wrong direction to me.  The go board is not really big enough to sustain two moyos (for the same player).  I would rather play at A or B (C12/13) to make the upper moyo larger and plan to make the lower left a smaller territory.

Another alternative would be to put your numerical superiority to work right away and attack with something around C (R11).  Sliding into the corner with D (Q3) would be good too.]
;W[cf];B[fc]LB[fd:A][qj:B]C[reid: Since O17 is already low, this stone would be better off high at A (F16).

I notice that all of black's moves so far have been on the third line - the territory line.  I get the feeling that black is planning to win by holding on to the territorial lead from his handicap stones.  

This is NOT the best way to use a handicap!

The handicap stones on the star points are not oriented towards holding territory.  Rather, they are most effective at attacking and fighting.

In a handicap game, black starts with a numerical lead in stones - in this game, three and a half stones to one (on average).  By the end of the game, that will be more like 123 1/2 to 120, which is getting pretty close to one to one.  This means the value of your handicap stones decreases with each move, which in turn means you should try to use your handicap advantage as early in the game as possible.

Putting these two ideas together, we see that in a handicap game, attacking early is a good plan.

Attacking around B (R10) would still be good.];W[bd];B[cc]LB[qi:A]
C[reid: this again seems like a territorial move and is a bit soft on white.

The black D16/F17 stones are not in danger, so black could attack around A now.]
;W[dh]C[reid: White settles his group.  This strong group makes the lower left corner look a bit over-stretched.]
;B[cq]LB[on:E][op:A][oq:C][pq:B][pr:D]C[reid: This defends the lower left corner, but is again very territorial and doesn't take into account the overall board position.

Consider: if black plays somehere else and white invades this corner, black will be able to build a strong wall while forcing white to live in the corner.  That idea indicates that black could seek to build a moyo based on that wall: something like A (P4).  If white follows with B, etc, black has succeeded in building his wall in a good direction while at the same time limiting the white moyo to the right.

Thinking in two directions at once, making your stones server multiple purposes, is a good way to get stronger.]
;W[pj]C[reid: White defends his weak R14 stone and starts the foundation for a moyo on the right side.]
;B[mq]LB[op:A]C[reid: Again, this is too territorial and too small.  Black gains only a few points with this move, and has only a very small effect on the white right side.

It's always important to consider the goals of both sides.  Since white is clearly trying to build up the right side, black can push a bit harder than he otherwise might.  A (P4) is not too far here because white will not be interested in splitting P4 and K3 - that fight would damage the white moyo to the right.]

LB[hi:D][hk:B][jk:C][ql:E][jm:A]C[Instead of playing R12, is Q6 (or around) better?

reid: One of the most important go proverbs to learn and really get embedded into your play is: "Play the urgent point, not the big point".

So where is urgent?  Well, obviously any time there is a group about to die.  But more subtly, any time there is a close fight where each play significantly alters the balance of power.

Here we have a white and a black group, neither of which is very well settled (the H5 white stones and the K3 black stones).  That makes this fight urgent.  Black might consider R12 big, but there is no way to guarantee he can keep sente in that area, so he can't really afford to change away from the lower side fight.

Black can simply extend again with A (K7).  Yes, he is pushing from behind, but the white responses will be simply connecting the white stones on dame points - the black lower left corner is very strong!  Later, K7 and following moves will help black to invade or reduce the white right side. We could imagine a sequence such as black A, white B, etc through black E.]
;W[kp]C[reid: White takes the initiative in this urgent area.]
;B[kq];W[ph];B[qg];W[pg];B[rf];W[qi];B[pf];W[qe];B[pe];W[ri]
;B[rg];W[mp]C[reid: White takes a small loss in the upper right, but keeps sente to continue attacking the weak L3 black stones.  This weakness allows white to build a really big moyo on the lower right.]
;B[lp];W[lo];B[lq];W[np];B[ko];W[ln];B[jd]LB[jm:A]C[reid:  Another territorial move.  But that huge lower right white moyo puts the game much closer than a few moves ago.

White's H5 stones are still attackable.  If black wants to keep control of this game, he needs to play A (K7) to keep white off-balance.]
;W[mg]C[reid: since black didn't play it, white should play K7 instead of N13.   It's urgent for both sides.]
;B[jm];W[lc];B[jc]LB[ld:A][ik:B]C[reid:  Black seems to be avoiding any fighting.

Black has a significant numerical superiority here, he needs to attack with A (M16).  Even better might be to ignore M17 and go for the big target with B (J9).]
;W[le];B[ll]LB[ik:A]C[reid: Wrong direction, and not safely connected.

Black's goal now is to reduce that huge white corner, but doing it directly with M8 is too blunt.  Instead, he should use the weakness of the H5 group to build up some strength which will allow him to reduce the moyo more severely.  Black should start with A (J9)]
;W[kl];B[km];W[lm];B[ik];W[kk];B[gl];W[eq];B[fp]LB[ep:A]C[It seems E2 was better instead of F4. What do you think?

reid: Sometimes the obvious move is best: I think black should simply block at A (E4).  White can make some shape with F4, black E2, white G3, black F2, but white is still not out of the woods.]

;W[bq];B[dq];W[er];B[bp];W[ar];B[gr];W[kh]LB[bc:A][bk:B]C[After white played L12, i felt that g2 was a small move.

reid: G2 is large but gote.  L12 is also large, but gote (possibly reverse-sente if white is worried about M15 getting cut off).  But G2 is territory for both sides where L12 is only white territory.  G2 looks like about 15 points - it's hard to see that L12 is worth that much.

However, A (B17) for example, is worth more than 20 points in gote.  B (B9) is a significant double-sente point.  Both of these are probably worth more than G2 or L12.]

(;B[md]C[reid:  Black can kill the corner if N16 is not necessary.  So it's worth looking for an answer to white A (P17) assuming N16 is not in place (because it's at S18, for example.

See variation.

Black concedes the corner to white with this move.  This looks like where the game is lost for black.

I think black's major problem in this game was thinking that resting on the territory from his handicap stones would be sufficient.  Handicap stones are an opportunity to fight with numerical superiority against a player with superior fighting ability.  This is both a great way to better your fighting abilities, and the natural way to use the handicap stones.   Using them to eke out a territorial win misses this opportunity.

When you take a handicap, fight early, and often!

Good luck, play strong...
