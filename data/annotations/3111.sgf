C[Hi!
I like to play Go although
i play it bad.And i usually
search go on the net because i like it.

g4: Hi!
I like to play go too. 
But you do not play bad.
In fact  you are playing a secure style. You always build safe groups. And that is a good beginning.
From that you are able to attack your opponent's group without looking after yours.
But for some reason you let your opponent stabilize his groups for no reason and nothing in return. Try to figure out the weak groups of your opponent and gain some territory while attacking them. 

I hope you will enjoy your next games more.
Peter (go4fun on KGS)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[qn]C[g4: I would prefer to occupy the last corner, but this move is not bad.]
;B[qo]C[g4: Big, but too early.];W[pn];B[dd]C[g4: This leaves a lot of aji at the bottom left for white.]
;W[qf]C[g4: good];B[qh];W[of];B[ql]C[g4: A strong fight. But the 2 black stones are too far away from one another.]

(;W[pj]LB[qj:A]C[how about the hand?
 "A" might be better
g4: My first impulse was to invade at A. But I think this move is also very good, if you plan to let black live and get immense outward influence. But I think a is better still. (see var)]
;B[qj]
(;W[qk]C[g4: I thought about Q9 (see var).];B[rk];W[pk];B[qi]
;W[pl];B[rm];W[qp]C[The hand is a try.
g4: This might by too small, if black gives up his stone.];B[ro]
C[g4: Too small.];W[pp];B[oq];W[po]LB[rn:A][sn:B][rp:C]C[g4: Too slow. I would prefer a, black b then c.]
;B[jq]LB[lq:A]C[g4: Again too far. A is safe.]

[qo][ro][so]C[Out of my imagination!
I grab the black group.
g4: Good! This makes your group absolutely safe. And black has to escape into the  center.]
;B[oh];W[nd];B[nc];W[oc]C[g4: Consider not to sacrifice a stone, not giving black good shape.]
;B[od];W[mc];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[ne];B[ld]C[g4: Don't peep where you want to cut.]
;W[md];B[jc];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc];W[rc];B[qb];W[kd]LB[mh:A]
[mi:B]C[g4: Too small, and not urgent. I would prefer surrounding black's left grou, perhaps with somthing like A or B.]
;B[kc];W[le];B[jd];W[lc];B[gd]LB[kh:B][mj:A]C[g4: No good sequence for white. You got 1 stone while black is building up territory at the top. But nevertheless  white is now able to attack at A then B. Black must make 2 eyes then.]
;W[dj]LB[kh:B][mj:A][mq:C]C[g4: Urgent move before big moves.  This is big surely, but black has 2 weak groups, which white should attack immediately. Black has some solid territory at the top right. White has only 4 captured stones, so white has to do something. I would prefer to attack at A, B and then C.]
;B[fq];W[dq]LB[hq:B][lq:A]C[I think it is conservative
but aggresive.
g4: I don't think that this is the right direction. With the white center group(s) you have some influence, which has to be used to attack something. If you let black stabilize his groups, your influence will be waisted. Therefore I would have preferred a splitting move. Something around a or b.]
;B[co]C[g4: Too gready.];W[do]C[g4: Good];B[cn];W[dn]LB[cl:A]
C[g4: Pushing once is enough. After making the stones heave take their base with A. Again you are building up influence, but you are not using it.]
;B[cl];W[cm];B[bm];W[dm];B[ck]C[g4: Now the black group is safe again.]
;W[hq]C[g4: Now this is too close to your strength. That means, that there will be too few points if black sacrifices this one stone.]
;B[hp];W[fp]LB[gp:A][gq:B]C[g4: Not a valid answer. Instead a or b.]
;B[gp]LB[gq:A]C[g4: A is safer.];W[gq];B[iq]LB[fo:A][fr:B]C[g4: First force with A. B might work too.]
;W[fr];B[hr];W[gr];B[fo];W[eq]C[g4: Unnecessary. This is only one stone!]
;B[io];W[lp]C[g4: At last...];B[no]C[g4: This means that black tries to esape. He must be sure, that this is safe. I am not.]
;W[ln];B[nm];W[ll]C[just chasing ..
g4: Good sequence up to now.];B[im]C[g4: ? Black cannot tenuki now.]
;W[nk]LB[mq:A]C[g4: Perhaps peep at A first. This gives less eyespace for black. If black answeres, I think he is dead.]
;B[ml];W[mk];B[lk];W[mm]C[g4: The shape move is at a. If black answers at b, you can  play this one. If black plays inside you can catch the splitting stone with geta. The black right side group is in great danger.]
;B[nl];W[nn];B[on];W[mn];B[mq];W[lq];B[rr]C[g4: Seems that black is alive now.]
;W[qq]C[g4: Futile];B[qr];W[mr];B[nr];W[mp];B[nq]
(;W[np]LB[rg:A][sj:B]C[g4: Again too small. This are only 2 stones!
Black's right side group is weak. Perhaps you can kill it with a then b. If black flees into the center it should be possible that his bottom goup dies. (see var for an example)]
;B[lr]C[g4: Unnecessary but big.];W[cd]C[Is it right?
g4: If the left side is important, this is ok.];B[dc]LB[cc:A]
C[g4: At least at A.];W[ce]LB[cf:A][cj:B]C[g4: It is possible to play at a. Perhaps now is the time for a move at b. This threatens the left side group. And you can build up some territory.]
;B[ci];W[de]C[g4: Better at a. This is thick, but white falls more and more behind in territory. And black groups are not such weak.]
;B[cg];W[cc];B[db];W[fd];B[fc];W[fe]LB[gc:A]C[g4: In order to fight and possibly split the back group you can play a also.]
;B[bq]

C[g4: This is the right one];B[in];W[hm];B[hl];W[fm];B[gl];W[gm]

;B[kk];W[ph]C[g4: Futile];B[pi];W[pg];B[oi];W[gc];B[hc];W[ge]
C[g4: Better to play at a. Adding a stone to sacrifice here cost black 3 stones to catch it.]
;B[hd]LB[gb:A]C[g4: Just at a.];W[rb];B[pa];W[cj];B[bj];W[bn]

;B[ai];W[bg]C[g4: Good!];B[ci];W[dh]C[g4: White is behind. And you can afford to play the ko. You have enough ko threats. Black has 2 weak groups.]
;B[rg]C[g4: Now the black group is nearly alive and the game is lost.]

;W[ih];B[if];W[hf];B[ig];W[hg]C[g4: Not necessary. To get some territory you should play the ko now.]
;B[jh];W[ji];B[ij]C[g4: The few next move seem without a plan. The only black group which can be attacked is the right side. If you try to separate this from the center you will gain some points in the endgame. (see var for a poosible sequence)]
