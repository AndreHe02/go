C[Hello!

I really enjoyed reviewing this game, it is was very demanding as far as reading sequences.  I enjoyed your style.  I respect sane players because I cannot play sane myself.  Here are the important points.  Also I included lots of variations so you could see my reading.

Main points from this game:

Things you must improve upon:

1.  You need to do more tsumego problems so your reading is sharper and you are more aware of weaknesses in your shape as well as your opponent's.  

2.  Direction of Play : There are several direction mistakes in this game.  You need to identify when a move is urgent/big, and also identify when you can just play elsewhere.  

3.  Sabaki: You play a bit heavy when lighter moves are called for.

4.  Removing Aji: You have a bad habit of peeping and it removes useful aji for you.]

(;W[gc]LB[fc:A]C[Two space jump here is unusual.  I don't like this move for W, it is too loose.  The normal move is at A.]
;B[he];W[id];B[cc];W[cb]
(;B[dd]C[A: I saw that the joseki is C16, but I think this one is playable because of the 2 spaces between D17 and G17. Do you agree?

Answer: No I do not agree with this move.  The reason is you are needlessly strengthening white.  He will play at E17 and you are left with the possibility of losing the corner.  If you had played C16 (which is the stronger move because your stones are connected and have more liberties) you leave with with weakness.]
;W[ec]LB[bd:B][cd:A]C[These two points could be problems for you later.]

First off b10 is on the second line and we're on move 18.  This move from white is small and greedy.   The game variation I think is Ok, but I think you could do better if you simply just...]

(;B[ib]C[I'd hate to play this myself but it is rather solid and it is not necesarily a bad move but could be slow.  It looks like you are attacking whtie but you really are not because white has b17.  Even if you play B17 yourself he plays b18 and he gains eyespace.]

(;W[lq]LB[eq:A]C[Ok so he invades although I don't know why because he has the territorial advantage if he simply plays A.  

At times like these you cannot worry about your opponent sliding under you.  Here's some variations.  Pay attention to how a flexible strategy works.]
