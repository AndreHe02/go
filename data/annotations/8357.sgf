C[Knitis: hi
diggyminer: Have a good game

Hi --- my name is Mark Schlatter.  I'll be doing your review.  If you want to find me online, I'm mschlat on KGS and DGS.  I'm happy to answer questions on KGS.]
;B[pp];W[dp]C[Knitis: have a good game];B[pc];W[cd];B[pj];W[fc]
;B[cq]LB[cg:B][cj:A][cm:C]TR[fc][cd]C[Mark: The 3-3 invasion is probably not the best idea here.  If White carries out the proper response (see my variation at 14), you get a small black group and white gets a large wall.  Moreover, that wall faces white's enclosure in the upper left.  With a few moves, White has major influence on the left.

I'd make a move like A to ensure a presence on the left.  Note that I can extend to B or C if approached.  I can also play A at C11 as well.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr]
(;W[gr];B[gq]C[Mark: Good idea to cut here.];W[hr];B[gp];W[ep]
;B[iq];W[kq];B[ir];W[nq];B[oq]LB[pn:B][pq:A]C[Mark: I'm not comfortable with the kick here, since White already has L3 as a followup.  A does a better job of protecting the corner and making White's live difficult.  B emphasizes the side.]
;W[np]
(;B[op]TR[pp][oq]SQ[pq]C[Mark: Okay, you are breaking a proverb here --- never make an empty triangle.  The triangle are the three marked black stones.  It is an empty triangle because there's nothing at Q3.  This is almost always bad shape.

If you are making this move to attack the white group, your thinking is sound, but your stone placement is wrong.  See my variations.  Typically, you attach or touch a stone for defense.  For offence (or attacking), you do not touch stones.]
;W[no];B[oo]C[Mark: Same error --- empty triangle.  Q6 is still a better choice.]
;W[jp]C[Mark: You can ignore this and play elsewhere --- see my variations.]
(;B[kr];W[lr]
(;B[hs]C[Mark: I'm not following the logic here.  You play L2, but then leave it for White to take.  You then take a move to capture H2, which you already have surrounded.

A few tips here: 
1) Playing on the first or second line is often a bad idea in the opening.
2) Look for big areas that you can play in --- the top and the left are good ideas.  It is tempting to play in the same area as your opponent's last move, but that assumes he made a correct assessment as to the important area.  If he's wrong, you can profit.]
;W[jr];B[hq];W[or];B[pr];W[nr];B[jq];W[ks];B[ip]LB[cm:A]SQ[cp]
[dp][ep][eq][fq]C[Mark: Again, I think you are playing close to where your opponent plays.  Here, the stone at J4 accomplishes very little.  The white group on the bottom is fairly safe, as is your black group.  Playng close to white will only help him strengthen his position.

Note White's marked stones --- they have no eyes and limited room to run.  An attack on the side (for example, at A) could be very effective.]
;W[jo];B[io];W[jn];B[om];W[qe];B[qd];W[pe]
(;B[pd]C[Mark: Again, you have an empty triangle.  See the variation.]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[qg];B[qi];W[rh];B[ri];W[rg];B[re];W[rf];B[rd]
;W[si];B[sj];W[sh];B[rk];W[sf]
(;B[oh]LB[kc:C][ci:B][cm:A]C[Mark: I have given some variations below.  The stone at P12 doesn't really help the group below or above --- both have good eyespace.  The attack you make helps make white stronger here.

I would be aiming at creating influence along the top.  You can play the hane at P15 and follow the variations.  Or you can make a big move around A, B, or C.]
;W[og];B[pi];W[pg];B[nh];W[oe];B[ng];W[nf];B[nc];W[jc];B[lc]
CR[ng][nh][oh][pi][pj][om]LB[ll:A]C[Mark: This is a very small extension from a group that looks alive.  I would look to bigger moves.  Besides the moves aready mentioned on the left, something like A (or even further out) starts to build a moyo.  However, I still think a move on the left is the biggest.]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[le];B[me];W[md];B[nd];W[mf];B[mc];W[kf];B[kc]
;W[jd];B[jb];W[ib];B[lb];W[hc];B[lh]LB[jh:A]SQ[fc][hc][jc][cd]
[jd][kd][kf]C[Mark: Note what White has been able to do here.  With the marked stones, White has huge influence pointing towards the bottom and left.  With a capping move at A, White builds a huge moyo.  Again, you want to be looking for moves earlier in the big areas on the board.]
;W[dm]C[Mark: A little conservative for white.  I would at least play at C8 and maybe further out.]
;B[dj]LB[cf:B][ci:A][cl:C]C[Mark: I'm not sure about the fourth line play here.  I would rather play at A (third line) and then extend to B or C as needed.  That two space extension is usually enough to guarantee at least one eye.  In your case, playing high gives White the opportunity to remove any eyespace along the side.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[cg]
(;B[dh]TR[ci][di]SQ[ch][dj]C[Mark: I have put some variations below.  The one space extension you have created is very small.  Any move that gives you more space would be helpful here.]
;W[ck]
(;B[cj];W[bj]
(;B[bp]LB[fi:A]C[Mark: I would run with the invading stones instead --- perhaps to A.]
;W[bo];B[br];W[cn];B[fn]C[Mark: Again, if you don't run out your invading stones, you are in danger of losing them.  See the variation.]
;W[fo];B[go]
(;W[en]C[Mark: White should cut here --- see the variations.]

;B[el];W[dl];B[jl];W[im];B[hm];W[mm]
(;B[mn]C[Mark: I think it is better to seal White in than make a move like this (unless you think you are behind).  See my variation at 138 to show how White starts to take away your territory.]

[es][fs][gs][rs][ss]C[So, some general comments:

1) One big issue I see is a tendency to play near where your opponent has played.  You need to look at the large open areas of the board and see if playing there would be worth more than playing close to an opponent's group.

2) Avoid the empty triangle.

3) If you wish to attack your opponent (either to kill their stones or make profit with territory), avoid the moves where you attach to one of their stones.  You do want to remove space from them, but attaching them allows them to hane and become stronger. 

4) You tend to play a "kick" when your 4-4 stone is approached  (see moves 23 and 47) , as opposed to an extension or pinch.  Try using the other responses to add some variety to your game and avoid bad shapes.

I hope this is helpful.  Feel free to contact me on KGS or via email if you have questions.

Thanks,
Mark
