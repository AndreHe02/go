C[Hi,
I am Tegaj Sergej and played black.

The kifu was not completed because byoyomi begins after w98. In the end I lost not only on time but by position too.

Questions: Is it possible to kill White's center group after w74 (in after game discussion my opponent said that it was here mistake)? If not kill, can Black ruin White's lower left corner after making a wall b91, b93, b95?

I left some comments and questions marked by ST.

[PO\] Hello Sergej. I am happy to be able to look at your game though I may not be strong enough to answer some of your questions. I will, in any event, try to show my thinking about positions.

Let me know if you have any follow up questions.
Paul];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[ec];B[oq];W[qf];B[pi]C[[PO\]  An interesting choice.

When I am trying to analyze a pincer against the R14 stone I usually begin with the assumption that white will take the corner and ask how I feel about the resluts of that.]
(;W[nc]
(;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc]C[ST: Can white now cut at P16?]
(;W[jc];B[qe];W[jq];B[cj];W[rp]C[ST: This is very difficult to answer at my level.]
;B[qo]C[[PO\]  This looks good to me.];W[qk];B[qi];W[ro];B[qn]
;W[rn];B[qm];W[rm]
(;B[ql];W[qq];B[pq];W[qr]LB[cd:C][de:B][cn:A]C[[PO\] I would be attracted to any of the marked points in this opening.]
;B[rl]C[[PO\] This is clearly the largest point locally but I would hesitate to play it.

We are still in the early stages of the opening and this move looks like an endgame move to me.
If you let white play here she adds only a couple of points to her territory and reduces yours by only a handfull.]
;W[me];B[nf]C[[PO\] Here I would be tempted to play on the left side as mentioned earlier.

I would look at your position as made up of two very very strong groups and for white to try and put the R14 stone in motion would be a grave mistake at this stage of the game.

If you play on the left and white plays hane at O14 I would think you could cut at N14 if you wanted. You could also just play again on the left side. You have the upper right corner and the lower right influence. The points around R14 take white several moves to reduce and she gets nothing for it in the end but some dame.]

(;B[bf]MA[dg]C[ST: Mistake. D13 is joseki. Now Black don't have a threat at B16 and loses sente because of that.]
;W[bd];B[dg];W[mq];B[ff]MA[ef]C[ST: Now I think E14 was better.

[PO\] I would agree. But, not a really big issue.];W[eq]C[[PO\] The game looks very close to me.

White has a lot of territory but black's right side is not small and the black influence dominates the center.]
(;B[mp];W[lp];B[mo]C[[PO\] This has the feeling of making territory in front of your wall which I would not think of as the correct way to use your influence.]
;W[lo];B[mn]
(;W[nh]C[[PO\] I think this is a mistake in direction for white. White ahead up to this point in the game. 

Also, the bottom left quadrant of the board is the most open and contains the most potential for white.]
;B[ln];W[kn];B[km];W[jn];B[jm];W[im];B[jk]CR[pj][ok][nl][mm]
TR[jm][km][ln]SQ[im][jn][kn]C[[PO\] Let's look at the exchanges again.

The marked black stones add very little to black's territory.
If you assume that black pretty much had locked down the points under the circles then the last four moves can be seen to add very little to that count.

The marked white stones however help white consolidate the bottom-center area and turn it into almost sure territory. Thus the territorial exchange has been much better for white. 

(Because of the cuts at M3, L5 and J6 I might have played J7 at J6 if I were white).]
;W[lg]C[[PO\] It looks to me that white is somewhat ahead.]
;B[mg];W[lh];B[mh];W[li];B[mi];W[lj];B[lf]C[ST: Now the fun begins.

[PO\] Right you are.];W[mf];B[kf];W[if]C[ST: My opponent said that it was a mistake. But I don't remember what she suggested instead. Now I don't see any simple continuations. All variations look very complicate for me. What is your opinion?

[PO\] This fight is way way too complicated for the likes of us to understand.

The game now enters a middle game fighting phase where the strongest scrapper will probably emerge victorious.]
;B[jg];W[ji]
(;B[ih];W[ii];B[hh]LB[gg:A]TR[ih][ii]C[[PO\] The delta exchange seems to me to have helped white. I think this is a turning point in the fight that favors white.

A note on shape. Later on the point of A becomes a problem. Having played at J13 instead of J12 would not have left such a point.]
;W[hj];B[il];W[fj]C[[PO\] Black's position here is very thin. Its hard to see a viable continuation for black.]

(;B[dl];W[ck];B[cl];W[bl];B[bm];W[bk];B[cn]C[May be that was good for Black.

[PO\] The question is can you lock white in and capture. I'm not sure it is possible.]

))))
(;B[ig]C[[PO\] In this sort of fighting I have learned that it is usually advantageous to fill up my opponents liberties.

Here you can see that your earlier play at F14 might be helping you out by being one line closer to the fray.
Once you secure this group you can start on the white stones which still have a distance to go.

I think it is very important not to give white any help in moving out.]

(;B[rq]C[I would be tempted to secure the corner.

No matter what the continuation I feel that black is ahead. Your R-line stones work well toward the center and white has crawled along the 2nd line which is usually bad.

I think white's play here would have been a very nice sequence to reduce a moyo. 

The problem though is that you didn't have a moyo to start with so I think white doesn't get nearly enough in return.]

(;B[oe];W[pe]C[A very good question you ask. And one that I cannot answer over the board.

I'm sure there are joseki dictionaries that discuss this.])
(;B[pe];W[oe];B[pf]C[I have seen this sort of variation where black dodges the sharp variations in exchange for taking territory on the right.

I think that black can treat the O-line stones lightly and let them go.]

(;W[qc]C[If black blocks at Q17 the 11 stone works nicely to build a wall facing the upper side. The josekis however usually end in gote for black so this would be the wrong direction.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]LB[pf:A][qj:B]
TR[pi]C[I assume this would be the continuation.

The placement of the delta stone now looks unsatisfying to me.

I would rather it was at A to really lock down the white stone or at B where it is further from the black wall and closer to the bottom corner.]
