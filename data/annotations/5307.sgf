C[Hi, this is a game I played at IGS, my account is bdkj.
Thank you to the reviewer who review my game. Thanks alot.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[nq]C[This happens to be a favorite opening of mine.  I nearly always play san-ren-sei.  One of my very regular opponents chooses the very opening you have chosen nearly every time.  So this is somewhat familiar so far.]
;B[lq];W[lp]C[curiously, we usually continue this way, though I normally play L3 instead of L4 as you have done.]

;B[iq]C[don't let him pin you in there.  Touching is usually disadvantageous.  You can use it for defense, if you know what to sacrifice, but here, it's probably best to just run for it -- or ignore it.]
;W[mc];B[jc];W[me];B[pf];W[mh];B[oh]TR[mh][me][mc]SQ[lq][kp]
[jp][iq][jc]C[This move is probably not as strong as playing q12.  I might try to play something in the upper left now though... so white can't use his thickness (triangles) to build a super-giant moyo on the left.


You have two weak groups (squares)  you have to keep an eye on them, but this early in the game, it's all about grabbing as much of the board as you think you can defend (and no more -- unless you like fighting).

Learn to recognize Fuseki, Chuban, and Yose.  Your motives are distinctly different in each phase.  Grab as much as you can, dispute the borders, get a little more if possible.  Personally, I think white would ahve responded if P12 was at c6, d6, d15 or c15.  YOu can also put a stone at d10.  TEchnically white shouldn't respond (yet) but probably would regardless.

As long as your opponent is responding to you, it's your game.  You can always come back and put a stone at q12 (not p12) after you think your ran out of things he'll have to answer!  

Rule:  A sente move is worth double.];W[dj]C[Oh, he got there first.  See how the board now looks white dominated?  No?  He has a huge amount of influence (his own san-ren-sei) pointed at some thickness across the way.  This leaves your K4 group and K17 stone pretty weak -- and serving no real purpose.]
;B[ps]C[way too small.   Think big.  The edges don't matter for more than 5 or 6 points (which can be huge in yose).  At this phase of the game, you need to find moves worth at least 15 points.  Try to surround 15 points or deestroy 15 points.]

;W[ed];B[fd];W[dd];B[fc];W[gd];B[ge];W[he];B[gf];W[je]C[White got more out of this than you did.  You lived, and have about 2 points of space... However, he got the big middle moyo, the middle upper side moyo, the upper left corner, and you still have to move in there to stay alive.  yikes!]

;B[pl];W[ho]C[Incidentally.  It's not too late to play at c3.   You can nearly always live in there.  Sometimes it's pretty tricky... but that's 15 points or so that you can destroy.]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[gq];W[ip];B[hr];W[hp];B[fq];W[eq];B[er]C[i think this is the move that killed the whole F3 grp, is it?

This may be the point at which it's too late.  Or it may be the last move before the white attack where you should have let white benifit in some way...  It certainly looks to me like at least a portion of this group should be able to connect over to the right side -- by playing n3 for example.

Try not to think of these situations as having one correct (or incorect) move that decides the entire fight.  That can happen occasionally, but normally it's a relative thing.  Thick enough to live, a little thicker than you needed, pretty good, has at least one eye and can run to something... etc.  Even a dead group can be very useful if you can get something with your threats to make it live.  We call that aji.]

;B[bj];W[bi];B[aj];W[ai];B[bl]C[maybe this move is not that important now? i should try to get as much territory as possible by extending from my G14 grp?

It is definitely important now.  You need to have this group live if you're going to bother trying to win.  The problem is having several weak gropus at the same time.  This gives white something to do (attack).]
