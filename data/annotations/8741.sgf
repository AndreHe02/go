C[~THANK YOU REVIEWER~ :D

I'm theshoe. I've been playing go for about a month and 1/4. My goal is to get to single digit kyu within a few months. Long term goal is shodan.

This game was entertaining to play, despite three huge mistakes near the end on my part. I hope it's entertaining to review. I've written in a few things in the SGF file that I wanted to know, but feel free to point out anything anywhere. I'm sure there are plenty of errors to point out!


Played on KGS, automatched.];B[pd];W[cq];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[dc]
C[First point of question. How would an experienced player react to this?]
(;B[ic]C[I just played a two space extension and made a base for myself. I feel like this may have been passive? Is there a better move?

-There are probably lots of other moves however i think this move is ok. This makes a base for black and threatens a move on the left hand side. If black makes a wider extension white may invade directly. Depending on my mood I might tenuki and play a shimari in the bottom right or a solid 2 space extension like you, or a 3 space high extension, or simply a 1 space jump to put pressure on the corner]

(;B[oc]C[Is this the right choice of joseki? Should I have pincered instead?]
;W[nd]
(;B[dp]C[I wanted to be speedy here, maybe It would have been better to finish the joseki at q14 but my decision felt pretty cool at the time. Thoughts about this move?

-I dont think this move is urgent therefore it is a bad move
The top is urgent, play urgent moves before big moves see variation]

(;B[eo]C[-This move is bad, see variation]
(;W[kc]C[-This is huge as is an extension around the starpoint on lower side.  It is hard to choose between them.]
(;B[je]C[I wanted to help j17 stones and attack at the same time, but now I don't know if it was a good move. What should I have played here?

(;B[df]C[I'm not sure what I wanted with this move exactly, I think i wanted a wall/center influence in sente. But thanks to my opponents response I got to cut my opponent into a split shape instead.]
(;W[ee];B[cf]
(;W[dg];B[ef];W[dk];B[jp]C[This stone ended up useless. I think I extended too far away. 

-I don't know if this is bad ,when white enters blacks sphere of influence his stones will come under a severe attack

An extension on the third line is more solid];W[fq]

(;B[ij]C[Here I wanted to press against h8. and maybe connect my top and middle groups.

- this move is redundant. Better to attack bottom left corner or reduce lower side. The top and middle groups are alive so no need to connect
