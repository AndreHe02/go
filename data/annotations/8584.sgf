AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Mark: This is the first game I have played in a while against a 9 handicap.  (While my opponent shows 16 kyu, he or she was 19 kyu when we started the game on dragongoserver.net.)  As far as I can tell, I lose the game by not having a presence on the right hand side and losing the center.  I would appreciate help on how to play against such a handicap.

REVIEWER: Pete Martin, 3k AGA. 

PETE: Good game! Both players have played some interesting moves. I like white's snap-back threat at move 53! Nicely done. 
Few comments for white:
1. R17 corner invasion should have been done much sooner
2. Avoid shoulder hitting 4th-line stones from the third line unless you are desperate.
3. Avoid moves that lead you to filling out KOs that are worth very little (moves 157, 165).  
4. Toward the end-game try to really look for the biggest sente move you can find. Look at the whole board and try to estimate what would happen point-wise in each sceneario. You will your end-game improve right away!

Hope this helps and thank you for allowing me to review your game.

-Pete]PL[W];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[nn]LB[lp:A][lq:B]C[PETE: typically you would jump to A to have a base. This is a handicap game so perhaps it is OK to try to run out fast but if back plays at B now, white will have no base and will lose points while trying to make eyes in the center. Hence I would prefer white to play at A here.]
;B[pl];W[kq]LB[nn:B][hp:C][fq:A][jq:D]TR[jp]C[Mark: Is this move too small?  Should I try for a larger move at A?

PETE: now that you have the move at B, playing here is not very producitve. If your goal was to move fast into the center and stay there regardless of the base than creating a base now is a switch of strategy to some extend. So I think I would agree - at this point I would try to use the 3-stone wall to do something else like attack the marked black stone with a move at C perhaps. The move white made here is a typical mistake in general. Shoulder-hit like this just provokes black to respond at D and build a nice wall as white tries to maintain solid structure.]
(;B[kp];W[jq];B[ip];W[iq];B[hq];W[hp];B[gp]LB[ho:A][gq:B]C[PETE: black is making a mistake of pushing white up. If black played at A or B instead this could turn into a nasty fight in which black will be ahead, I think as long as his 3 stones stay alive and can jump out to the center.]

TR[io][jo][ko][lo][mo][ip][jp][kp][lp][mp][hq][lq][mq][hr][ir]
[jr][kr][lr][mr][hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms]C[Mark: I move along here.  It's slow and it gives black an opportunity to build up influence in the center, but I thought it was worth it to avoid black getting the squeeze move at J6 and to get a stable group.  Alternatives would be welcomed.

PETE: Yup, there is no way to avoid this sequence. Black gets influence but as you have later found the cut point at A is probematic for black. White made 25 points here at least so I would say it is OK to move along and create cut poits for black.]
;B[im];W[jn];B[jm];W[kn];B[nl]LB[ll:A]C[PETE: This move is worth very few points right now. Top area is too open for black to try to seal it from the bottom. White can still jump out at A at some point.]
;W[cf];B[ef];W[ci]LB[bd:A]C[PETE: again, watch out for those 3-rd line shoulder hits. This move is not bad but I would prefer to jump to A instead.]
(;B[cj]C[Pete: See variation.];W[di];B[ej]TR[cj][dj]C[PETE: notice how this wall gives black a lot of territory later in the game. White invited black to create it.]
;W[fh]LB[bd:A][cd:B][nd:C]C[Mark: I am jumping out so I won't get sealed in and so I can influence the center.  Is a better move to move to the center (say A or B)?

PETE: yes, I would at this point try to just settle in instead of jumping out. I would try to get sente life and approach at C next.]
;B[ei];W[dg]LB[bd:A]C[Mark: I think this is a mistake on my part --- too concentrated.

PETE: yes, you should jump out to A and then move on to another area. See variation for why I think so.]
(;B[eh];W[eg]C[PETE: See variation:]
(;B[fg];W[ff];B[gg];W[ee];B[pg];W[fc]C[PETE: good attack but I think black can still live if he plays at 3x3 now. See next variation.]
(;B[md];W[gm]LB[qc:A]C[Mark: Is it better to do a 3-3 invasion (especially in the upper right) than cut?

PETE: yes, I think I would invade top right corner now. If black plays at A he will secure big junk of the board.]

PETE: Yes, not enough room.];B[qh]LB[lo:A]C[PETE: Here black gave you opportunity to utilize the marked stokes for something .. maybe just a reduction but it will be worth something...
Forget for a second that black playing at A is a killing move :)]
