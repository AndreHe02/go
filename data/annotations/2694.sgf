C[At first i am no good in english.
Everycomment is important to me.

My question is
How to play opening good than this game?
please tell me where is my wrong move?

>> Hi. I'm glad you submitted your game for review. As white
you really had good potential in this game. While you lost by
about thirty points, I feel the game was closer than that. I
hope my comments are clear.If not feel free to write me back
for an explanation. I hope you continue to enjoy playing and
learning Go. It only gets better and better from here!];B[pd]
;W[dq]C[i think 4-4 is risky than D3
any suggestion?];B[dd]C[Hicaru [21k\]: hi

4-4 again??
i think he don't fear me to attack at 3-3];W[pp];B[cn]C[how to respond C6?]
;W[qf]C[R14 or Q14?];B[nd];W[of];B[kd];W[cl]C[i think that move is little danger

>> Actually, I think this move is fine. The black stone at C6
is in more danger than the white stone at C8.];B[cq]C[ohhh
don't familiar this move]
(;W[cp]C[C4 or D4?

>> Definately D4. Playing C4 invites vicious finghting, which
your position overall does not support any better than black's.
Wait to start this kind of fight until you have more support
from other stones. You want the fight to turn out in your favor.

>> I would rather play D4 and induce black to try to live in
the corner, which he should have no problem doing. In trade you
will gain power that will be very useful later. (See variation)]

C[>> This is a good result for black. He approached the white corner,
was attacked and still started to make territory at the bottom.
White does not have much to show for it. Compare with the situation
in the variation after move 12.];B[qq]C[3-3

;W[kq];B[jr];W[np];B[pr];W[ip];B[hq];W[ql]TR[pd][nd][kd]C[is it too low?

>> Yes. R8 would have been better at perhaps Q10. If black invades
somewhere in the Q/R 6-9 area, white can attack and push the
invading stones against the excellent white wall at the bottom.

>> By playing to low and to close to the white wall or "Thickness"
you encouraged black to invade where he did. His invading stone
is now closer to the three marked stones. Much easier for black.]

C[strong wall];B[li]
(;W[qc]C[i think it will work

>> Yes you can live, but will the result help or hurt you strategically.
Timing is everything on 3-3 point invasions. If you invade to
early you may get a corner but give away much more than you take.

>> I would continue to push the line of black stones.  While
this neutralises your white stones at the bottom it will give
you needed strength to invade the top. And if your timing is
good, the white stone at R8 will still help you made some territory
on the bottom right. (See the variation)];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc]

[qf][ph][oh][nh][mh]C[ok it work

>> You lived but at what price? Black should be very happy with
this exchange. White has taken a corner but almost no territory.
The resulting thickness that black has as a result of defending
against the invasion has now sandwiched the  marked white stones,
which now must worry about making life. Meanwhile, black has
create a wall on row 11 that to a large extent counteracts the
once formidable white row staring up from the bottom.];B[ch]
LB[cf:a]C[how to respond that move?

>> Prevention is the best medicine. The best solution for this
situation is to have made this move first. But that failing,
I would still try to develop strength by chasing the line of
black stones, aiming at an eventual invasion around (a).];W[bm]
C[>>  ??? By letting balck have G16, you have given him such a
powerful position at the top that it will be difficult to recover
from. I realise you are worried about the stones in the lower
left, but you have to take some of the big moves and fight later.
By being to cautious you have surrendered much teritory to black.]

I think you're too late to do much to teritory at the top. I
would ensure that the marked white stones are safe. If black
gets R11 first they will be lucky to live.];B[hj];W[gn];B[go]

where is my weakness?
why empty triangle is bad?
please tell me any tactics

Thank you for review my game and
Thank you for your kindness

>> WHite had good prospects in this game, even after the early
fight in the lower left. Letting the black sotnes on line 11
live easily and exert much influence was costly. Also, letting
black have the big moves on the upper left and top sealed white's
fate. 

>> This was a closer game than it appears. White simply suffered
from bad timing. Keep working on that  and you will do fine.
Good luck!])
(;W[kh]C[>> The goal is to get ahead of the black stones and make them
fight for life, trather than putting yourself in a position where
you are the weak one. By abandoning the running battle in the
center and attacking the corner, you only helped black.]))

[fn][fk]C[There are many ways that this sequence could have gone. However,
the general idea is that black is left with approximately  11
points in the corner. White is left with considerable influence
toward the middle. Any future play by black in the area marked
by squares will have to contend with this white power.]))
