C[Igor : Dear reviewer, I played that game on KGS on january 2006. It shows a characteristic problem with me : I won some figths, either capturing groups or shutting them along the border and buildling a strong influence, but I let my opponent creating a huge territory at the same time !

That is why I would like you to focus on timing and direction of play : where and when to invade, to attack ? how to reduce territory ?

I thank you a lot.


Dear jonik, I will try to do a helpful review. Please excuse me for any misjudgement, I'm only amateur player.

I summarize my comments at the end of the game. Kind Regards,
Alberto];B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[cp];B[ep];W[dn];B[gp]C[Igor : should be at H4. It was so narrow that I decided to attack it.

A: ok, but that the extension is so narrow does not mean that B has a weak group. So for an effective attack, you need to have a strong position against a weak postion.]
;W[dq]C[A: I think this move is locally good and takes advantage of B's narrow extension.]
;B[eq]C[A: I think this move is not really good answer for B. W can play everywhere now without having to worry about the lower left corner.]

;B[oo];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[pj];W[jo]C[A: I think W24 is a little slow, the upper side is larger now.]
;B[jd]CR[pd][pj][dd]C[A: this cannot be bad for B.];W[fm];B[ip]
;W[jp];B[iq];W[hn];B[cj]C[Igor : I was surprised by the number of tenuki. at that point or before, should I invade black moyo or should I try to kill black group ?

A: It seems to me that B played there because he's confident to keep its group below alive.
Just trying to kill the group may  not be enough now, don't you agree?]

A: What was your attacking plan?

;W[nk];B[nj];W[mj];B[ni]C[Igor : at that point it seems to me that I helped Black too much and that an invasion was urgent. Where should it be ?

A: O17 seems fine enough. I think the problem is that W has not been effective in the fighting.]

[hf][gf][ef][lc][kc][mb][kb][fb][la][ja][ha][ss]C[A: I think the main problem at the beggining is to improve judgement of the overall-position.
Attack only works against weak positions. Invasion works when there is enough room for one or two eyes. But invasion was not your problem.

Second, when attacking (protecting) a weak group, you have to be careful and strive to read out completely the sequences.
Third, when protecting (attacking) weak groups you have to remember to count how many liberties (moves) are required for the capture.
This was for me an interesting game. I think you will improve quickly.]
