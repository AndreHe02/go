C[Flameinice [5k\]: hi



Dear reviewer,



I played black in this game. Although I won, I feel I could have done much better because I was playing too passively and following the saying 'play conservatively when you're winning'.]

(;B[pf]C[Is this move ok? Although one of my books always uses this move as a response to o17, I find it passive and feel that white's opening is faster and more efficient.

This move looks pretty good to me, I think you could also try the pincer  but the stone in D17 prevents an  attack-extention if white enters the corner and also can cause some problems if he decide to go for the center (that  is propably the best thing to do for white).]

Thanks for reviewing. After looking at this game I felt depressed because it looked like a boring game. I think I was also passive to the point of being pushed around. Any advice to lift my spirits?

the game wasnt  boring at all , at least  for me watching it.
you played some submisive moves  when you could have  ended the game and win  for example when you played L14 instead of jumping at]
