;B[ql]C[I think  this is forcing against white.  Once sequence that black can play if white  ignores is shown here.]

(;W[ph]C[This seems premature.  White has got a weak  group in the lower left and upper right, and this move will make another one.]

;B[qc];W[pb]C[This is sort of what I expected.  White has been surrounded in one  place, and has a weak group moving into the centre.  A sample sequence for  black is shown here.]

;B[jd];W[ic];B[jb]C[This hurts white, but there's not a lot  he can do.]
;W[kb];B[cj];W[re]C[Nice timing for white.  This reduces any  forcing moves black has against white in the centre.]
;B[cm];W[cn]C[This  should be at C5.  This move makes black strong while still leaving C4 open.  If black plays D7, white will have his corner almost surrounded.  However...]
;B[er];W[dr];B[cg];W[dm]C[...This is a good move for white.];B[cl]C[This next  move is a tough one for white.  White seems to be a bit behind on territory  (assuming black gets C4 and a move around G16, both should be sente), but  that N11 group is safe, so white shouldn't be really worried about a  splitting attack.]

badly. b m4 should be at n6?

(;B[fc];W[eb];B[hb];W[gd];B[fd];W[hg];B[hi]C[There doesn't seem to be any need for this move.  White  has nothing that he can link up to in a single move, so maybe Black should  play at F14 or something to stabilize his own stones.]

;W[cb];B[lh];W[li];B[cp]C[oba: at this point I was about 20 points behind so I  tried to create
trouble. W could reduce my r8 group to almost nothing in sente. But if I play
conservatively at s11 or k12 I'm sure of losing.];W[es];B[fr];W[bp];B[bc]

;B[db];W[dh];B[fi]C[This move  doesn't do anything.  It doesn't attack, defend or take territory.  H12 would  help take a little territory in the centre.]
;W[eb];B[jk];W[fa];B[en];W[dn];B[jh]C[oba: at this point I was a little more optimistic. The  kos had given me
some profit but I was still behind.                                                 PW:  Black follow up F11 well, but this should be at E8, since that is  the larger moyo.  White should move with E8 himself now.]
;W[kh];B[kg];W[qi];B[qj];W[ri];B[km]C[E8 is still larger.  the K9 stone has a good relation  with K5 and J5, so that entrance is blocked off.]

                                  PW:  Actually P16 is even bigger.  F15 is  worth about 4 points, but white Q16 is worth 5.]
