AB[pd][dp]C[This was a game a played recently with a friend on 2 stones, in which I took black.  The game was long (about 2 hours) and the final result was black +9.5.  I hoped for some general comments, although anything would be useful.  Thank you in advance.

Also, the SGF only has 140 moves, and the order may be off after move 126.  For me the opening and middle game is the most important area.]

klin: N17 good move.];W[fq];B[hq];W[cn]C[Suggestions at this point?

I think my play was sub-optimal.];B[fp];W[gp];B[gq];W[cq];B[cp]

;W[ig];B[ge];W[qj]C[Should black continue to squeze the K14 stones?

klin: K11 is a key point.];B[ro];W[qp];B[ql];W[qg];B[qh]C[klin: R12 too much. R15 or S14 enough.]
;W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[rk]C[Is this bad?

It seems weak in principle, but later having a strong group around S7 is very useful.]
;W[oh];B[rp];W[mi]C[Are the three stones at L12 important, and if so is there a good move for them?

Black just gives them up.

klin: K11 still good now.];B[rq];W[ij];B[gs]C[klin: G1 no good.]
;W[jr];B[hp];W[go];B[ho];W[fn];B[mq]C[klin: Now, look at the exchange between G1 and K2, B helped W.]

;W[rc];B[qc]C[Big?

Black played this beacuse the jump to Q18 is big and sente.

klin: R18 better]
