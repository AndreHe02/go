C[H: Hi, I'm playing white here and lost by 4.5 points. So please point out as many mistakes as you see, as every single one could have made me win ;-)

Thanks to the reviewer in advance!];B[pd]C[-- Hi Hannes,

this is Zoran aka wayward (10k) on KGS.  Hope this review will prove helpful!  Please do not hesitate to ask for any additional info on the game or point out any mistakes I've made :)]
;W[dc];B[qp];W[cp];B[oq];W[pj]C[-- This move is a bit strange in my view.  While it certainly does spoil Black's plans for a double-wing formation, it also gives him a nice target to attack by extending from the top stone.  See variation for a possible play by Black.  Instead of Q10, you could simply play somewhere at the bottom center and check Black's moyo growth from the outside.  Even if Black took Q10 later on, it still doesn't wouldn't give him any secure territory and you'd be free to invade later.]

(;B[jq]
(;W[eq]LB[dn:A][eq:B]TR[cp]C[-- A slow move.  Even if you get to take H3, Black still has more influence along the bottom.  Points A and B are miai for the life of your triangle stone, so there's no rush to play either one of them right away.  See variation to see what options White has if Black approached immediately.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[be]LB[df:A][dg:B]C[-- this is "not joseki", or at least not one that I know of :)  Anyway White doesn't defend his corner with B15, so Black can threaten to take it and build up.  It is almost a must for White to take C16 here.  After that, it is Black's choice to continue with a joseki move either at A or B, or even tenuki (but only if he knows what he's doing).  For White, however, there's no other move than C16.]
;B[df];W[dk]
(;B[dd]LB[dd:B][dk:A]C[H: Black did not respond to white A. Is B more important?

-- Black didn't respond to A because right side is not interesting for him at this point.  With White B14 in place there isn't room for life there, so he naturally goes for the corner.  He does it the wrong way though; see variation.]

(;W[cd]C[-- C16 gives you bad shape (empty triangle); Black's hane at E17 is now almost sente.  Proper move for White is nobi at A.]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[db];B[bb];W[ab]C[-- a clever move, but Black has an even more clever one ;)  See variation.]

(;B[ad];W[ca];B[bd];W[ba];B[bf];W[ae];B[af];W[ac]C[-- well, Black has been punished :)]
;B[fc]C[-- this is another mistake by Black.  F17 is not really connected to the Black wall.  White can attack it from the right and establish himself at the top.  See variation.]

(;W[bk]LB[cn:A][bp:B]C[-- this move is also kinda slow.  Black can still invade at around A or even try to sabaki at B later.  Since you already have a stone at D9 I'd suggest you leave the left side as it is and limit Black's growth on the top as shown in the previous variation.]
;B[pg];W[qn]C[-- maybe one line closer.  Black is already strong in this area, so if he invaded at R8 it would be very difficult for White.  One of the stones would almost surely die.]
;B[qi];W[pi]C[-- If Black wants you to take optimal shape, you shouldn't stop him :)  R10 is a must for White.  It would stabilize your group and give you all sorts of possible followups to invade Black's top right stones.  A stable group here would also mean that you can try and detach the K3 stone from the lower right corner.]
;B[ph];W[qj]C[-- Black should have pushed to R11 himself for a very strong attack.  This way he lets you live in sente.]
;B[ri]
(;W[rj]LB[ql:A]C[-- this is a good move locally speaking, but on a more global level, it passes the initiative back to Black.  Observe that Black can still aim at A for a splitting attack, and although you would be able to connect underneath, you'd have trouble making eyes there.  So the way to go is to jump ahead towards your stones on the left.  If you build your presence in the center part of the board, you're sure that any attack you launch later on will have adequate logistics.  See variation.]
;B[on];W[po];B[pp];W[oo];B[no];W[np];B[op];W[nn];B[mo]
(;W[om]C[-- actually White needn't hurry to capture the P6 stone; there's a driving sequence he can play to increase his group and make Black confined to the bottom.  See variation.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[rn];W[rm];B[mn];W[mm]C[-- good move!  It'd hurt real bad to let Black cap this White group.  If he gets any more influence he could just kick back and watch his territory build up all by itself.]
;B[gq]C[-- this is small, compared to the top which is still very much open.  White should ignore G3 as it poses no threat to his group and invade the upper side.]
;W[fo];B[jc]C[-- this Black move shows he's still concerned with the life of his upper left wall, but big walls can defend themselves.  K17 is overconcentrated.]
;W[nc]LB[pc:B][mi:A]C[H: I choose a low approach because I thought it better, to endanger his corner (and be sealed in) than make him defend corner and side while getting influence to the center.

-- I think this is playable.  O17 would be ideal play for Black himself, so taking it away must be worth something.  It would be even more valuable had you had a stone at A or nearby, regardless of whether that stone would help you make any territory -- it would simply make your invasion much more dangerous.  Another option is a probe at B -- Black would have to choose between letting you live in the corner or letting you live at the top.  Such moves are tricky to play, though, and they highest value is exactly in the positions such as this - when you invade a very strong, nearly completed, territory.  Most of the time an attachment at B develops into sabaki sequence, so even though invaders don't make direct life they still manage to escape and damage territory significantly.  I'd suggest that you try it sometime with this in mind.]
;B[pc];W[lc]LB[ne:A]C[H: It took me about 3 seconds to find this bad move. Jumping to A would have been better, right?

-- Shape-wise, yes, for then Black would most likely cap you at O13 and you'd get to take M16 for shape.  This way he can continue the attack from above.]
;B[kd]C[-- which is not exactly L16.  N15 or O15 are much stronger.]
;W[ld]C[-- it's imperative that you run away lightly.  When you're surrounded, you want to play lightly, make good shape and extend towards friendly stones, even if that means some parts of the group will fall prey to the attacker.  Remember, you want to deprive Black of the total dominance at the top; going for life or making slow moves usually proves not good enough.  Therefore N15 for White is a must.]
;B[le];W[oe]C[-- Looks like a threat, but it isn't.  O15 would have been good shape.]
;B[me];W[pe];B[qe];W[nd];B[qf];W[kb];B[jb];W[ob];B[mb]LB[mb:A]
C[H: Before black A I thought my group to be pretty much alive.

-- it's always very difficult to live in hostile territory.  Go for life as your last resort.]
;W[pb];B[qb]

;B[hi];W[gi];B[ii];W[fh];B[gf];W[gk]C[-- Black got a lot of secure territory out of this.  Luckily his center wall is facing your living group so he can't put it to much use.]
;B[fm]C[-- here's an opportunity for you.  If you want to attack an invader, do so by making double threats.  H5 quickly springs to mind.  See variation.]

(;W[em];B[go];W[fn];B[gn];W[gm];B[hm];W[gl]C[-- endgame starts.  I presume you know how to play the endgame: double sente first, then reverse sente, then gote.  But this doesn't really sum it up: you need to know the relative values of the moves too.  For now, suffice it to say that the most valuable moves are those that both increase your own and decrease your opponent's territory.]
;B[lm]LB[gr:A]C[-- for example, M7 is a big move, but it is not sente.  White's territory will not decrease significantly if Black followed with an atari. so White should take sente and play at A for example.]

You could really prosper if you tried to play your next dozen or so games only by building atsumi (strength); don't get too concerned with the life or death status of your groups as long as they can expand and limit your opponent's options.  That way, when they invade (and they will have to), you can strike back with agility and force them to retreat while you build your own secure territory.

Both are playable in my opinion, although I would prefer B here since Black has better control of the center so White could have some trouble invading the top later on.  This concept of "center dominance" is one of the most difficult ones, so don't feel bad if you can't understand what I'm saying; it's also possible that I am entirely wrong. :)]
