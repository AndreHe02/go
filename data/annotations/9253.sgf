C[Hello, viewers! Iplayed it with black stones, my nick is fox2 on DGS. My feeling is the turn 47 change game flow and after it, I played more satisfied. But was it a good move? And was my position bad before turn 47? Please, answer.


T : Hello, I'm Tilwen (1k KGS), and I'll try to answer your questions. My feeling is that you had an easy game, your opponent let you do almost what you wanted, that's not really the most interesting games for you to review, but anyway I think we can say something :) . My comments will start with a "T" .]

;B[kc];W[jd];B[ld];W[jc];B[me];W[oe]C[T : There is a good way to connect this shape : san-san.]

fox2: Is this move OK for white?

T : I think it's an overplay from white, making several weak groups is always a bad idea. But I think I would split before taking corner.]

(;B[oc]C[T : Now white can aim at connecting, I think there is still aji at san-san here.]

(;W[rg];B[ph]C[T : White make you play the move you missed first :)]
;W[rd];B[qg];W[qc]
(;B[rf]C[T : maybe this is premature, you can cut with S14 or S12 later. Maybe make sure white doesn't connect first.]

C[T : I'm not sure this sequence makes something good for you, I mean white doesn't get two eyes easily, but your R8 is a bit hurt and white goes easily to the outside. Later if this really cuts, you can play it.]

fox2: my feeling as black is I was overplayed.

T : White T11 is about useless, white can go to the outside.]

(;B[gc]C[
fox: Is this move OK for black? In game, it initialise my victory, but I am not sure, if opponent didn't help me so much.

T : Your position is strong, so it may be playable. But keeping on the attack on the right group is easier.]

fox2: I think is better capture stone play at A];B[bp];W[iq]
;B[kq];W[mq];B[lp];W[np];B[no]C[T : It's usually a bad idea to play contact move to attack. Most often, contact moves are defensive moves (both player will get stronger groups).]

fox2: I feeling my strength, so I cut here. Good move?

T : As you're ahead it's OK, you will take the marked stones, and you have enough points to win easily. If you were behind, maybe you should try to kill the whole group, with N8 or N9 for instance.]
;W[om];B[nk];W[jg]C[T : White left group is so not alive ... I'll end here the review, please fell free to ask me questions (by mail for instance !).
