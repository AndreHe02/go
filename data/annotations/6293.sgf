C[[m\] Hi! Thanks for reviewing my game!

I  played black, and lost with a small margin. I didn't made major mistakes (or my partner didn't notice them :)), but this was not enough to win. Please give me some advices on how to improve my strength, point on my major mistakes on this game.
I added some comments and questions to the game,  they are marked with [m\].
Mondik.

[NM\] Hi Mondik, I will comment your game];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[pk]C[[NM\] Hi Chinese opening, I would prefer to play N4 for white now]

(;W[cj];B[jp];W[jd]C[[NM\] Both black and white playing for a moyo game, this is something often kyu players do. I prefer to stop my opponent make a moyo and start fights.

Moyo games are difficult to get a feel of who is winning.];B[nd]
C[[NM\] Also Tengen possible for black];W[qd]C[[NM\] Not sure if this is a good idea as black influence is better than white terrritory]
;B[qe];W[qc];B[pe];W[re];B[rf];W[pc];B[oc];W[sd];B[pb];W[qb]
C[[NM\] Black influence is better and black gets sente, down side is that K16 is in a good place for white]
;B[po]C[[m\] I felt making a shimari is a good idea. Was it?

[NM\] Yes, it is a very big move, although it does give away sente.]
;W[np]C[[NM\] This moves is an overplay I think]
(;B[lq]C[[m\] I'm not sure this is the best move here. Should be O6 instead?

[NM\] Yes O6 is much better];W[lp];B[mq];W[kp];B[kq];W[iq]C[[NM\] This move appears a little strange.]
;B[jo];W[fq]
(;B[jq]C[[m\] Is this move ok?

[NM\] It is not needed, better to play faster]
(;W[ir]C[[NM\] This is slow from white again, white can take sente and play elsewhere]

(;B[mp]C[[NM\] Not needed, think on capturing these on a bigger scale]
;W[cn]
(;B[fc]C[[m\] I felt I have to do something in this corner. Was this the proper move?

[NM\] Here I would prefer to go to the corner C17 and then reduce white moyo from outside]
;W[hc];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fb];B[be]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[ch]C[[m\] What is the best play in this situation?]

(;B[ho]C[[NM\] This move is very slow, it doesnt make territory or reduce white enough]

(;W[lc]C[[NM\] The middle is more important than the 3rd line at this point]
;B[le];W[mc]
(;B[md]C[[NM\] Not needed , take sente elsewhere];W[ob];B[nb]
;W[pa];B[nc];W[rg];B[sf];W[qf];B[qg];W[pf];B[rh];W[pg];B[qh]
;W[oe];B[od];W[mg]C[[NM\]  Not sure what to suugest for black here, it seems white has a good chance in the fight.]

(;B[of]C[[m\] I didn't find a better move here.];W[og];B[nf]
;W[mf];B[ng];W[nh];B[ne];W[oi];B[mh];W[mi];B[lh];W[li];B[lg]
;W[lf];B[kf];W[kh];B[kg];W[ki];B[pi];W[oh]C[[m\] And what's the best move in this situation?]

(;B[mo]C[[m\] Is this a good move?

[NM\] No, very bad move. I am sorry but this move does nothing.]
;W[ll]C[[NM\] White is where black wanted to play]
(;B[if]C[ Should be H14 or H13];W[he];B[hf];W[ge];B[hi]C[[m\] Or O7, O8 instead?

[NM\] H11 is a good move, it aims to reduce white and attack white M11. It has two aims.]

(;W[ii];B[hj];W[ih]
(;B[ij];W[hh];B[gh];W[gg]
(;B[hg]C[[m\] I know, bad shape, wrong move. Maybe G14 better.

[NM\] Black is alive. Stopping white from connecting is not very important as white M11 should live.]
;W[jf]C[[m\] ouch]
(;B[je];W[jg];B[ke];W[ie];B[nj];W[oj];B[ok];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk]
;B[ml]
(;W[gf]C[[NM\] Is this move needed, if white plays elsewhere what can black do?]

(;B[dl]C[[NM\] Good];W[gi];B[gj];W[fi];B[fj];W[ei]
(;B[cl]C[[m\] I think this was not a very good move. Maybe just E9 to connent,  or kikashi at M9, then try to isolate M8... I'm not sure.

[NM\] I would try something in the C3 corner, L17 is also getting a big move]
;W[ek]
(;B[fl];W[el];B[em];W[dm];B[dn];W[cm];B[en];W[do];B[ej];W[dk]
;B[dj];W[ck];B[di];W[dh];B[bi];W[im]C[[NM\] The D8, C8 capture was too good for white]

(;B[fk];W[km];B[hm];W[ln];B[jn];W[jm];B[mn];W[in];B[io];W[hn]
;B[gn];W[go];B[fo];W[gp];B[gm];W[jk];B[ci];W[bk];B[bh];W[cg]
;B[ld]C[[m\] I know, small, but white made it sente :)

[NM\] You were lucky!];W[kd]
(;B[lb]C[[m\] I missed the variation on the game.];W[kb];B[mb]

[pr][qr][sr][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][ss]C[[NM\] Ok, Three things to improve and win the game

1. You played some slow moves N4, K3, H5, J14 which did not play on a big scale, think big.

2. In a moyo game try to reduce your opponents moyo and expand your one, very important. 

3. Try taking sente. Try not to follow opponent's last move. Make your opponent follow yours! And then take the biggest point.


Ok, Its hard to comment on moyo games.
I like to fight and fighting will improve your go game! 
Try to fight more and learn tsumego which will help your reading when in a fight

Thanks, and hope you enjoy the review.
