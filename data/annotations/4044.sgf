C[Hello GTL Reviewer,
Thank you for taking the time to review my game.  I am ZenPudding (black).
I feel I need some tips with regards to mid-game attacks on enemy area's of influence, as well as some sente grabbing yose pointers.  I will leave comments to describe what I was thinking at certain points.
Also please comment on any other aspects you feel I should work on.
Thank you.

Please note that on move 63 I asked for, and was allowed, an undo for a misclick.  That explains the new path the moves follow afterwards.

J: Hi, ZenPudding. I'll prepend my comments with a "J" (from Jaime, my name). I hope I'll be of help.]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[dc];W[qd];B[ce];W[pj];B[oc];W[oe];B[mc]C[My first mistake, I believe...should n17 should have been M17.

J: Yes, n17 is too close. White's been very nice allowing you to extend from you shimari.
M17 (more conservative) or M16 are better moves here for black.]
;W[kd];B[me]C[Trying to run towards center.

J: It's ok, but you can always tenuki and wait as you have to possibilities for living: running towards center (as you did) or r2 to grab the corner.]
;W[gc];B[ic]C[Trying to split white stones.

J: You're playing too aggresive, IMHO. D10 or K4 are bigger points. Anyhow, a nice attack.]
;W[id];B[kb];W[jc];B[jb];W[ib];B[cj]C[J: Both ended with living groups, but you kept sente. Nice.]
;W[hc];B[kf]C[J: I don't like this move; your group is already alive, as well as white's. K3 is a nice move now.]
;W[if];B[ip]C[J: Almost as nice :-)];W[dg];B[nq];W[no];B[pr]
;W[qq];B[lp]C[J: Not bad, but it invites white's m6, making a nice moyo.]
;W[lo];B[pg]C[J: Difficult to find a good place to invade. Taking into account your prospective territory, maybe a reduction would be more than enough, perhaps around O12 or even O10.

If possible (I cannot see a way here) try to reduce white's terr. increasing your own at the same time.]
;W[og]C[J: White should avoid touching what he's attacking]

J: The result of a failed invasion is a bigger and stronger opponent's territory. Now you need to make more points than before. As your lower left corner is still open, maybe F10 is a bigger move now.]

J: It's a pleasure. I'll go back now to try a few more comments, but I should say you must stop answering all (well, most of)  your opponent moves. He is trying very unreasonable things and you keep answering. I'll mark them now as "unreasonable". You try a few ones, but very few.

There's been a problem with your lower left corner, white grabbed you too much territory here. Also, depending on the center leads to smaller territories. He succeded reducing your center terr. while increasing his own.

The invasion on the right side was a failure, it was too ambitious and/or too late. 

I'll go back now.

Well it's done. I hope it helps you at least a little bit.]
