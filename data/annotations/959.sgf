C[
This is my game against 'wane' on IGS.  He is a strong 6k, probably closer to 4k strength.  My comments on this game are marker "DS:"

ug: My comments start with "ug:". I hope they are of some help to you.]

;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[em];B[cd]C[DS: I think it may have been better to make a shimari in the lower right instead of this.

ug: I agree about this. The left side does not seem to be very interesting, and so the
position that white gets by pressing at d15 is probably favorable for white]
;W[de]
(;B[cf]C[ug: c15 instead of c14 is the usual move here (see the variation)]
;W[ce];B[be];W[df];B[cg];W[dg];B[ch];W[dh]
(;B[jc]C[This was to counter W's thickness.  But his outfacing wall still would pose a problem for me.

ug: This is certainly the right idea (in fact, white should have played an extension himself),
but maybe the fourth line was more adequate,
because then white cannot cap so easily. Furthermore, i am not sure whether this extension
is too far. I think k16, l16 and m16 should be considered as possible alternatives]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[dd];B[bd];W[mq];B[po];W[mo];B[qj]C[DS: I felt the game was still pretty balanced here.

ug: The problem is that white now has the capping move at k15.]
;W[je];B[ld];W[lf]C[ug: This is of course perfect for white. (Nevertheless I think that black's m16 was the
right move, but it should become clear why black l16 instead of k16 might have been better)]

(;B[mj]C[DS: W was creating a huge center moyo. I chose this move as a reducing move and enlarging my own moyo on the right. Unfortunately it left B thin.

ug: Surely black has to do something about white's moyo, but this move looks strange.
I think I would prefer p10, which considerably helps black to build own territory.  White cannot close off the center with one further move.]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[DS: blocking the other way seemed too narrow and let W enter the right side.

ug. right];W[pc]
(;B[od]C[ug: this looks a bit strange, see the variations for the usual moves (that seem to
be just all right here).];W[oc];B[nd]C[DS: I debated about playing O17 here. I think this makes B overconcentrated, and poor shape.  Maybe in reflection o14 would have been better.

ug: I prefer o17 here. O14 would leave the two black stones at the top in a weak position.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]C[ug: Now white has a big corner, and additionally gets sente.  This is a very good results for white]
;W[qp]
(;B[qo]C[DS: just connecting seemed too meek and obliging.

ug: I am not so sure about this. On the other hand, your result seems to be ok.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[qq];B[np];W[pr];B[mp]
(;W[oq]C[ug: what about white m4 instead?];B[nq];W[nr];B[lq]
;W[mr];B[lo]C[DS: I thought i was successful here in invading the W's bottom territory. The corner was big, but I thought this was bigger.

ug: Probably this is all right for black, in particular because it might be possible
to use the aji remaining in the stone at f3.];W[oj]C[ug. This might be an overplay (and I think it is not necessary for white to invade
so deep). Black should try to attack this stone severely.]
(;B[pk]C[ug: Maybe it is more important to prevent white from escaping by something like o12.]
;W[ok]
(;B[mn]C[DS: I thought this necessary.

ug: I am not so sure. In addition, if the white p9 stones can escape, it will be very
hard for black to win this game - he simply doesn't have enough territory.
See the variation.];W[oh];B[ni];W[oi];B[mg]C[DS: B put pressure on W's group to try and live. I had plans to use B's thickness to invade the center and wipe out W's moyo.

ug: That is of course the right idea.];W[mk];B[mf]C[ug. Is this really necessary? Now white's groups is more or less safe.]
;W[mm]C[ug: white m9 seems better.];B[lm];W[ml];B[om];W[qi]
;B[ri];W[pl];B[ql];W[ol];B[pm];W[qh]C[ug: Now a black play at the bottom seems most interesting. You should try to use
also the f3 stone. If you can separate white's j4 stone from the group at the left,
this stone will have difficulties.]
(;B[lg]C[ug: That does not seem very good. You could try to attack the m14 and k15 stones,
but m13 is the wrong move.];W[kp]C[ug: Good move for white.]
;B[lp];W[jn];B[jr]C[ug: This might be ok, but black should not take gote here. Moves like c18 or g17 seem to
be bigger.];W[ir];B[jq];W[iq];B[jp]C[DS: W still got fair amount of territory at the bottom.

ug: True - and furthermore white now has sente, which is very valuable.]
;W[cb];B[di];W[ei];B[dj];W[cm];B[bn];W[dm];B[bm];W[ck];B[ej]
;W[fi];B[he]C[ug: Maybe g17 is better?];W[id];B[ig];W[ic];B[jf]
;W[jb];B[kc];W[gd];B[fj];W[hh];B[ge];W[fe];B[gg];W[hl];B[gi]
C[DS: At first I thought this was a good move, but afterwards I think it was an overplay. Just playing at F14 or F13 would have been enough.

ug: Anyway, for example o19 or s5 seem to be bigger.];W[gh]
;B[hd];W[gc];B[hb];W[hc];B[ib];W[gb];B[kb]C[ug: Nice sequence for black. Nevertheless, black is clearly behind now.]
;W[fg];B[hg];W[mb];B[nb];W[nc];B[mc];W[ob];B[lb]C[DS: B retained sente this way.]
;W[na];B[kn]C[DS: maybe It would have been better to play  Q13 now threatening W's eye space.

ug: Yes. Furthermore, this move doe nst achieve much for black. Why not s5
or s12?];W[jm];B[ih];W[hi];B[ii];W[gj]C[DS: I shouldn't have given up this stone so easily.]

;B[ja];W[el];B[fk]C[DS: From here on it was mostly endgame, but W made big progress. The game was still very close now. B had recovered somewhat, but not enough to win.]
;W[co];B[bo];W[am];B[ap];W[ai];B[ah];W[aj];B[hk];W[il];B[pg]
;W[ph];B[sj]C[DS: P13 would have given B more cash.

ug: Indeed. The move at t10 is very small.];W[og];B[of];W[qg]
;B[pf];W[ng];B[nj]C[DS: Bigger move might have been H10];W[nk]
;B[nh];W[hj];B[bg]C[ug: why?];W[ij];B[jj];W[gk];B[ia];W[ga]
;B[ff];W[ef];B[gf];W[ll];B[jk];W[ik];B[km]C[DS: I should have played at A6. This would have given me two more points.]
;W[an];B[ao];W[al];B[bq]C[
 cygnus 8k*: yeah, A6 was bigger];W[jd];B[ri];W[sh];B[la];W[ma]

;B[qe];W[kl]C[
 cygnus 8k*: thanks.  I think you played better though.
 cygnus 8k*: yeah, thickness like that is terrible];B[kh]C[DS: If B had connected at L8, B would not have had to play L12 and lose a point.]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[ie]C[
 cygnus 8k*: i  make too many blunders liket that.];B[if];W[dk]

;B[rg];W[tt];B[tt];W[rf];B[in];W[im];B[rg];W[tt];B[rf];C[
ug: This was a good game; no big blunders, only some smaller mistakes.   In the upper left,
white gained some advantage, and his thickness was particularly valuable together
with the capping moves at k15 and m14.

In the upper right, black could probably have handled white's invasion better.   In the lower right, an exchange took place, which probably was ok for black, but
black missed the right point to use the aji of the f3 stone and to destroy whites bottom.

Finally, black probably could have attacked the white p10 group more severely.]

to protect his cutting points.])
