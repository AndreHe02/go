AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[I am a noob.  I played as a child, but I stopped very young.  Also, it really wasn't GO but a game at the time I thought my dad invented for me, but have since found out is really just "atari-go"  I made some notes as I went along, with what I was trying to do.

Hi Daniel,

my name is Marc and my current rank is 9 kyu (+/- 2) on KGS.

You'll will find my comments at the appropriate moves and
the conclusion fo the whole game below.

Conclusion
-----------------
1. This game shows, that black isn't ready to play on the 19x19 board as he misunterstood some
basic concepts of the game (Block the opponent if neccessary, Always think some moves ahead, ...).
So Black should play on the 9x9 board a little longer to get a better feeling for the game of Go.

2. I would recommend to prefer playing against humans instead of computers (if possible).
A good Go Server is KGS:

3. I strongly recommend to do some beginner life and deth problems on:

>A is a bit defensive but solid move (especially because of K4).

  (usually this move is a bit slow but black has D10).];B[bo]
