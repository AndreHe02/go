C[Hi dear reviewer! This was  a close game. I really don't have questions about this, I played to my best quality, and I can't tell where I could have done better. I just wish that you could show me the points where I could have played better because I can't find them myself. Thank you very much for reviewing, I'm currently really trying to become stronger!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hello!

SUMMARY: You fell behind early in the game, but multiple errors and loose moves by your opponent gave you a chance to almost claw your way back in thanks to a very solid endgame.

OPENING: your decision to play low on the right side was iffy, and playing a second move there was missing the mark. Playing two wide extensions from the 4-4 allowing an easy corner invasion (which made one of your wide extensions useless) gave your opponent a slight edge.

MIDDLE GAME: Your attachment to the bottom right 4-4 instead of cutting and starting a fight to utilize your wall was very confusing. Instead you gave up corner invasion aji, and gave your opponent a solid living group that nullified your wall.

ENDGAME: You did quite well. You missed a monkey jump, allowing White to get r18 gote. The main issue is you spent endgame moves trying to build a center, but there are almost always too many ways to reduce it. Each poke is one or two points.]

Your move seemed to say "I am afraid of the avalanche joseki".

(;B[cn]C[here I should have fought a ko fight with a9

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have taken a look at the ko at A9. Basically Black has many threats on the right, but White has many threats locally with the g7 weakness and onwards. Also, White can get a decent result on the right if he plays right, so it depends on how many mistakes you think your opponent will make.

What you should do is leave it unsettled for now, and come back to start a ko once you know you will win, or let your opponent take gote to end the risk.]
;W[al]C[Lets take a look at the score here.]
(;B[ii]C[~~~~~~
Very steady move.

Black is going to need a lot in the middle here. Black has gotten almost no compensation from the wall in the upper left, and almost no compensation from the wall in the bottom left. You have been pushed onto the second line on the right. It comes as no surprise that you end up losing this.]
;W[ql]LB[oa:B][bn:A]C[THE ENDGAME

The endgame has begun.

Since all the groups are settled, and there are no more open areas on the board, it is time for the macro-endgame.

You actually played the endgame quite well, but you missed an important move. Your opponent also messed up a few times, so in all, the problem with this game most likely did not come from the endgame.

A and B are your sente. Take them now.
The middle looks open, but it is much harder to get middle points, so a move like in the game is not usually as valuable as a move near the edge.]

Black has 15 with the left group, 6 on the bottom and 12 on the right. (33).
