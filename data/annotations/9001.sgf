C[Dear reviewer, my name is Thibaud. I am playing go again after a long pause (1 and a half year).

I think that I am getting into the bad habits and trends I had worked to eliminate. I get too caught up into the game and stop thinking about the meaning of each move and about the overall situtation once a battle starts.

Overall I think I try to make games too complicated.

Please give me your comments on the fuseki and on the way to handle battles in the middle game (when to stop fighting, which direction, when to protect). I have also left a few questions for you, and tried to explain how I thought during the game. Of course feel free to give any advice or remarks you can think of when reviewing the game.

Thank you very much in advance !];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]

;W[nd];B[pf]TR[oc][nd]C[--- The P17-O16 exchange was bad for black. 

Black's corner can be still invaded at R17. Now, K16 makes an ideal shape with the 2-stone white wall.]
;W[jp];B[hp];W[mq];B[po]C[Where is the next move ?

I wanted to attack H4 but did not know how to do it .];W[em]

(;W[eo]C[Here I think my attack is a failure, but I do not know what I should have done instead.]
;B[fq];W[fr];B[gr];W[ch]C[Here I thought the lower situtation was stable enough and decided to attack here. Am I too aggressive ?]
;B[cf];W[eh];B[de];W[cd];B[gg];W[ff]C[--- This peep was a mistake. Black's shape is quite strong. White cannot cut the connections  unless white's surrounding is very strong.]
;B[fe]TR[ff];W[ef];B[ee];W[fi]C[--- You made black's E15 group strong without gaining much. White also ended in gote.]
;B[fl];W[el]C[--- This is the correct direction for white. Try to connect all groups together.]

The two other variations are better I think.];B[ec]

(;W[bn]C[--- Attacking black from this direction is not correct. Black can connect on the side with B12 as you can see next.

It is necessary to start from D13. See variation.];B[bh]C[In this situation, I never know how to answer correctly and end up with a disaster.

Is there a good way out ?]
(;W[bi];B[ci];W[bg];B[dh];W[dg];B[cg];W[qc];B[ob]C[I was lucky he chose this side since I could destroy his entire side territory. I am not sure I had enough point if he just gave me the corner.]

(;B[pb]C[--- Actually, after your last move, there is no way for black to live inside now. Black should just try to run away. See variation.]
;W[sb]C[--- You don't need to play here. Black cannot live inside anymore. Playing at O13 to shut him in is better.

If black just plays O14 now, he might be able to escape. So, you gave black a chance here.]
