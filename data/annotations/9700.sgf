C[maciek_b: Hi
kamoro: Hi];B[cd]C[kamoro: Hi];W[pd];B[dq];W[pp];B[nc];W[kd]
LB[ec:2][qf:1]C[Responding at 1 would allow B to play some variation of mini-chinese, and end up with more territory. Instead I pincer, and aim for influence. It also gives support if I approach at 2.

Yoaav: Totally reasonable. So far this is all professional-grade. But don't be worried about other options either; plenty of good moves. By the way, there's something strange about the intricacies of approaches to mini-chinese coming up in a game between a 17k and a 24k. Judging by the play I suspect you're each rather stronger than your ranks would indicate.]
;B[ne];W[pf];B[qg]C[Yoaav: Bad move for him.];W[qf]C[Yoaav: Good punishment.]
;B[rf]C[Yoaav: Very bad move. This ends in gote for him, but without getting enough for it.]
;W[re];B[sf];W[se];B[rg];W[ec]LB[ec:2][kd:1]C[Tenuki, because I have pretty good control of the corner.

Yoaav: I wouldn't quite say that. But your group can easily live, and that's good enough. Tenuki is definitely an option. I might still play a move to attack, however. Lots of good moves on the board.]
;B[cg];W[hd]C[Yoaav: I think I'd prefer H17 here. By being lower you can make your group stable. As things stand he can threaten your base in sente, and thus get a base for himself in sente. If you're strong, you'll make his reinforcement gote, thus letting you tenuki afterwards and get another big move.]
;B[kb];W[lc];B[lb];W[ib]C[My attempt to close off the top area from further encroachment.]
;B[mc]C[Yoaav: Big mistake from him. These stones were already connected. If you play N17 he could respond with N18, and if you play N18 he could respond with N17. This move gets him basically nothing. He should have threatened your corner with Q18. Then his group would be basically alive, and it'd either be sente or he could take your corner and then put pressure on your top right group.]
;W[ob]C[Yoaav: Good. Now you have a solid base and he doesn't. Urgent move.]
;B[oc];W[pc]C[Corner is pretty much mine now.

Yoaav: It sure is.];B[ng];W[co]C[Yoaav: Definitely a very big move. You keep him from enclosing the corner (and enclosures based off of a 34 point are very efficient). The left is also his most developable area, so reducing it is definitely good. There's an urgent move on the board, however. I'd play Q13. It splits his weak stones in the upper right into two weak groups and threatens to kill his little clump on the right edge. If he blocks at Q12 your cut at R12 works--he can't atari downwards because it would put his group into atari.]
;B[gq];W[cl];B[cj];W[nq]C[Yoaav: Definitely a big move. But I'd either secure my left group with B3 or attack the upper right. You're definitely way ahead already, though, so it's no big deal.]
;B[qj];W[ql]C[Yoaav: What's the point of this move? It puts pressure on his group, but he can relieve that pressure with his response. You kind of extend along the side, but you're playing close to his strength and that invites complications.]
;B[oj];W[jp]C[Yoaav: I like the double wing. I'd still worry more about the group on the left; when you're ahead, it's a good idea to make sure you don't have any weaknesses. If he plays C4 then you basically have to respond at D5, letting him take the corner in sente. Your K4 stone makes pressuring that left group less valuable (as there's less for him to do with the influence) but It'd still be a good idea for him. Also, keep in mind that your bottom right corner is still open to invasion; those aren't points just quite yet.]
;B[jr];W[lq];B[qn]C[Massive fight incoming! This is the point where I spent the most time reading.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[ol];B[ml];W[nm];B[sl]C[Yoaav: This doesn't connect anything. Weird move.]
;W[rk];B[qk];W[rm];B[sm];W[rn]C[Yoaav: This worked out really well for you. He forced you to connect. That was rather nice of him.]
;B[rl];W[sn]C[Yoaav: This move is greedy. You get to capture his three stones, but you let him atari you. The three stones aren't big. They're worth just 6 points. Throw in a few more points of reduction if you like, but it's still endgame. Even if you weren't going to play locally, there are *way* bigger moves at B3 and C18. But I'd make sure that his two stones are really dead; then you'd be really nice and strong. I could go for a super slow and strong move at Q8. Q9 is likely better, as it might even be sente if he wants to keep you from pushing in. But the important point is this: don't bother taking a small group of stones if there's no larger issue of life-and-death in the offing. If you need to kill to live, then kill. If you need to kill to attack on a large scale, then kill. But if you're just taking a few points there are better ways to get points at this stage of the game. You wouldn't believe how much of an advantage you can take letting your opponents kill small groups of your stones or save small groups of their stones. If the stones have no strategic significance, the moves are practically wasted.]
;B[pl];W[sk];B[qm];W[rl];B[pk];W[ri];B[rj]C[Yoaav: Bad move.]
;W[sj];B[qi];W[pg];B[ph];W[oh];B[nh];W[pi];B[og]C[Yoaav: Augh! Huge blunder for him. If he had just connected at R12, he could have cut at either P13 or P11. But now he's letting you take so he won't be nearly as strong.]
;W[qh];B[rh];W[ph]C[Yoaav: Were I to play locally, I'd probably have saved the S11 stone instead and fought to ko for the clump of 5 stones. It'd be guaranteed profit for you, a flower ko. But the move at B3 still looks way too tempting for me to pass up.]
;B[si];W[sh];B[ri];W[ok];B[om];W[on];B[nl];W[nk];B[nj];W[pm]
;B[mk];W[om];B[pj]C[I would have liked to kill B's group, but I still came out way ahead in this fight.]
;W[df]LB[cd:1]C[I intend to either get a wall facing outwards, or one facing up which I can use to attack the stone at 1.

Why do you want a wall facing outwards? The middle of the board is already a mish-mash of white and black. His thickness on the right will keep you from making big territory in the middle. I'd definitely play for the corners instead of the middle. His C16, C13, and C10 stones are much stronger than your C8 and C5 stones. (Two two-space extensions being better than one.) You're way ahead so there's no need to attack. Just make your groups strong while taking big points.]
;B[dg]C[maciek_b: Maybe I should resign but I have still fun from playing ;)

Yoaav: Wrong side to block from. He should make himself solid and prepare to attack your bottom left group. Letting you cut off his C16 stone is absurd,]
;W[cf];B[ed];W[dd]C[Yoaav: Whoa! This wedge is a bit much! You give a lot of forcing moves when you try to cut a one-point jump like this.]
;B[dc];W[de];B[eb];W[fc];B[cb];W[bd];B[bc];W[ce];B[cc];W[ad]
C[Yoaav: Why this move? It does save your B16 stone, but is that stone important? His corner group is alive, as he's got an eye in the corner and another eye at D18. If he takes your B16 stone not only is it gote, but your counter-atari at B14 would undercut his other group. That would be great for you!]
;B[ld];W[le]C[Yoaav: Why play in this local area? He's attacking your M17 stone. But your M17 stone isn't doing anything at all. Let him have it, and take a bigger move elsewhere.]
;B[kc];W[md]C[Yoaav: You spent a full move to threaten a ko for the M16 stone, a stone which is worth 2 points. This isn't just endgame, it's *tiny* endgame.]
;B[me];W[lc];B[lf];W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[jd];W[id];B[fg]C[Yoaav: Your fighting in the center really hasn't yielded much for either of you. It's a small area. Both your groups are going to live, and it's the center. This move of his (though exactly the best) is in a much more important area of the board. The left side is far from settled.]
;W[fe];B[ef];W[ee];B[kj];W[ih]C[Yoaav: If you want to reduce the center, it'd be way better to play E8, as that would also strengthen your only weak group.]
;B[jg];W[ig]C[maciek_b: thanks];B[ji];W[jh];B[kh];W[lm];B[ek]
;W[gh];B[fh];W[ff]C[Yoaav: Why attack the E14 stone? What is its value? There's a corner in the bottom left that's up for the taking. Even apart from the fact that your two stones can be severely attacked, just taking the corner is literally more than 10 times as big as this kind of atari.]
;B[eg]C[Yoaav: It's a big mistake of his to respond in situations like this. Making a gote move sente is bad.]
;W[gg];B[gi];W[ik];B[ij];W[hn];B[em];W[bq]C[Yoaav: Ah! Now things feel good! Now the game is over.]
