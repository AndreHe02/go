C[Dear reviewer,



please review for White. I added some comments.

Thanks!



Best regards,

LB[nc:A]C[janr: it is common for white to play A to avoid the result after the pincer where white gets a corner but black gets influence which works well together with his shimari in the bottom right]
;B[qi];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]
;B[me];W[mc]C[Too slow here?

I did not like to get shut in, if Black plays there.

janr: locally; this move is ok.  If white would feel that he is really behind (e.g. due to blacks moyo) this would be too slow I guess.]
;B[fq];W[cn]C[I thought a pincer would get me in a difficult fight.]
;B[jp];W[pj]LB[rp:A]C[Probably better to probe at 'A' first. Then look for a move to reduce/invade.

janr: not necessarily.  I think the reduction is good.  Depending on how it evolves white can decide whether and how to invade the corner (the large keima enclosure is easier to invade than the small one).]
;B[pl];W[qj];B[pi]
(;W[oj]LB[oi:A]C[janr: I would also consider A, the hane on the top of two stones.]
;B[oi];W[mj]
(;B[ni]LB[nj:A]C[janr: I think making cutting points by playing A is better for black.]
;W[ol];B[om];W[nm];B[nl];W[ok];B[on]LB[ql:A][rl:B]C[janr: here, white can make an eye in the center and has also room along the right side (e.g. A or B)]
;W[mm];B[mo]LB[rl:C][pm:B][rp:A]C[What is your opinion about this position.

I was quite satisfied. I think there is still some aji in the corner with 'A' and 'B'.

Overall Black seems a little overconcentrated to me.

janr: I think Black did not play optimally here.  Also, his last move is better around C or tenuki.]
;W[rp]LB[ql:B][rl:A]C[janr: an invasion in the corner is premature I think.  
First, there are bigger points in the open area on the left.
Second, depending on later developments, white may want to keep the option to not invade the corner but make an eye for his right center group with A or B]
;B[ro];W[hq]LB[dj:A]C[I wanted to make Black even more overconcentrated.

Probably better to stay calm and build a moyo with 'A'?

janr: I prefer a big point on the left ('A' or an extension from the upper left corner).]
;B[hp];W[iq];B[jq];W[ip];B[io];W[gp];B[ho];W[gq]C[Till now result is according to plan, but the following moves are somewhat problematic.]
;B[dq];W[cq]LB[lk:B][ll:A][jo:E][fp:D][gp:C]C[janr: black may have several sente moves in the center (at least A and B) which threaten the white right center group.
So, if black can disconnect white and the group C should escape to the center, the double attack may be cumbersome.
Maybe white D is locally bad but globally safer.  White has taken blacks territory, black will live in got in white's corner, white builds influence and can aim at the cut of E]
;B[ep]
(;W[go]LB[do:A]C[I thought after playing at 'A' I would get shut in.]
;B[do];W[cp];B[en];W[gm];B[el]C[Now my corner and group at the bottom seem weak.]
;W[co]LB[bm:E][go:C][jo:D][dr:A][er:B]C[janr: A may be an alternative defensive move which reduces black's eye space and aims at connecting.  Of course, black can start a ko (B), but in that case white knows already that he can save the C group in ko in case of emergency.  He can either fight the ko, or play tenuki, e.g. D or  E]
;B[fm];W[hn];B[jo];W[jm]LB[gk:A]C[janr: Instead of connecting immediately, I would do so indirectly by putting some pressure on blacks group at A]
;B[gl];W[hl];B[cl];W[cf];B[ci];W[gk]LB[ec:A]C[To slow here I guess.

'A' better?

janr: The game move is probably ok as it threatens to make a ponnuki in the center in sente.  
If black answers, white still can play A.];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd]
;W[id]LB[fd:C][dk:B][fl:A]C[janr: The capture at A or the probe at B should be played sufficiently early (before black knows in which direction white will chase the C stones)]
;B[de];W[ce];B[ed];W[dc];B[kd];W[kc];B[fg]LB[dk:B][fl:A]C[janr: now 'B' is loosing its value as black can probably capture a white stone thre.  'A'  is still sente.]
;W[jd]LB[ib:B][jc:E][ld:C][le:D][mi:A]C[Seemed big to me. Better at 'A'?

janr: white remains open to black 'B', so is doesn't seem very big.
To defend against the cut of black E, I would prefer 'C', which has a stronger effect on blacks right position (maybe black answers at D)]
;B[mi];W[lj];B[ke]LB[ib:A]C[janr: now 'A' is sente for black]

(;W[qo]LB[qm:A]C[Trying to create more aji.

janr: I would play A first, which influences both white's stones above and below.]
;B[rn];W[qq];B[pp];W[rr]C[Living with ko?];B[pr]C[Figured out, that I will be dead without ko.]
