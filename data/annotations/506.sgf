PL[B];B[dd]C[it is considered more polite to play in the upper right corner]
;W[pp];B[pd];W[dp];B[qn];W[nq]C[Maybe this is too passive.
answering on O4 is another possibility];B[on];W[qi]C[I think this move is too close from the two bottom black stones (which  in some manner
be seen as a 3 stone wall ; thus erasing its influence requires to play 5 (=3 +  2)
intersections away from it)
Since there are only two black stones, one can't however be completely sure.

But, for sure, this move is too far away from the upper corner : a black stone  at O14
now would be a corner enclosure AND an approach (attack) move on the lone white  stone.]
;B[pj]C[Looks like a good move, aiming at sealing white in and building outward  influence
(this is consistent with playing the first two moves on hoshis)

Yet, as the game will show, black's influence won't work with the hoshis

;W[qj]C[Good. this is the most common answer
(Trying to push directly at P11 may be feasible)];B[pi]C[From a purely local point of view, black would like to play Q9,
but this would cause over-concentration on the side (thus justifying the
fact that the shoulder hit would have been better on Q12)];W[pm]
C[Why didn't you hane directly at Q9, trying to keep black separated ?
This move is (of course) sente (though black will be tempted not to answer it)
but it also strengthens the P6-R6 stones, leading your corner stones to stand
in front of a real wall....];B[pn];W[ql];B[pk];W[om]C[It is a good idea to try to keep black separated.
Yet, this move forces black to add a stone to his wall,  weakening the bottom right corner a little more.]

;W[lc]C[This is a good move
Since black waisted time on the side, white stabilizes his stones here.]
;B[nc];W[qe]C[white wants black to have a very small corner..]
;B[pe]C[strange move : building a wall is inefficient because of the white  stones on the upper side (the wall faces them, thus has nearly no influence)]

(;B[pc]C[on S16, better];W[pf];B[cn];W[ci]C[white may try to go one line lower ?
though that leaves more space between the white stones, it looks more like a  pincer on the black stone than this move does.]

White has been "double-approched" so :
-1- he must try to keep black separated
-2- (quite similar to -1-) he can't accept to be shut in the
 corner];B[dn]C[This is a failure for white : he has been completely sealed in,  black is connected, and the hoshi stone is not yet alive]

will live (see variation)]

C[White has a very small center, his right side is devastated.
I think black can be happy with the position.

White should play another move to secure the center
(problems arise later in the game)];B[fp];W[kp]C[white 98, looking like a good kikashi move may prove to be painful for  the corner stone (F3-F4-F5 is stronger than F3-F5 alone).

;W[gr];B[ho]C[Maybe F2 is better, assuring black of the corner

This move is quite similar to what white played in the upper right : it is an  invitation for a push and cut.

;B[mj]C[if white is allowed to play here, the black stones will end captured]
;W[jm]C[The white center group is secured, but white is still losing on the  board, unless he manages to save his D4 stone.

So white was certainly right to resign, but i'd like to make a few remarks (hope  you won't feel offended) (there is no special order in the remarks)

-1- I suspect white may have resigned thinking his center group was captured,  which is a mistake
-2- Since the result of the game doesn't depend on the life/death of the center  group, white may (should?) have resigned earlier
-3- after struggling for life in the center, white should show fighting spirit  and seek life on the upper side and/or in the lower left corner]
