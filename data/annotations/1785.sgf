;B[dp]C[First let me say that I found this to be a very interesting game. Also, although both players are ungraded, some of the tactical play is very strong.           I have tried to point out where, in my opinion, the play could have been improved, and where ojne or other players had the wrong attitude. But I am only 4kyu myself, so my judgement is not that great. In fact if I met either of these players in a game I might easily lose!]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[pd];B[de]
(;W[fd];B[dj]C[This doesn't feel quite right. A 1-point jump from fice would have strengthened your stone in the top left, and left you free to make a different extension from 1, depending how white approaches the lower left.]
;W[fp]
(;B[hp]C[And this seems a bit severe. If you don't want to make the one point jump as in the vatiation the pincer is better played one or two points to the right.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cp];W[fn];B[dm]C[The result of 9 is that 15 is a bit close to 1-13.]
;W[hq]C[This was not urgent, but it seems that white likes his groups to be secure]
;B[iq];W[hr];B[ir]C[This is an endgame move. If you are worried about 9-17 you should guard your cutting point. The remaining star points (or close to them) were the remaining big moves]
;W[gp]C[This, move, which you more or less forced white to make, is Sente, so now White gets to play first on one of the big points.]
;B[ho];W[jd];B[pj];W[qq]C[But I am not convinced that this invasion is the rigtway to use his Sente. He could have extended from 4, threatening an incasion behind 23, or invaded behind 5, or played to consolidate his top left.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]
;B[nq]C[The result of this Joseki is that Black's influence works well with 23 and 21. Black seems well ahead at this point.]
;W[jj]C[This is an absolutely excellent move, exactly where Black wanted to play to complete his big Moyo.]
;B[gm]C[I thnk this is Black's first bad mistake. There is almost no chance of capturing white's group at the bottom left, and there is no need to connect Black's groups. So it as a nearly complete waste of a move.]
;W[qh]
(;B[oh]C[Black does seem to have lost the plot here. Simply nibbling away at White's moyoy is not enough. White secures big territories at the top and on the right while Black has to make many more stones to make half as much in the middle.          At this point it was essential to invade deeply in the upper right.]
;W[pg];B[nf];W[nd]
(;B[lf]
(;W[jf];B[kh]C[Unecssary, a play at 50 was still much better]
;W[jh];B[ki];W[ji];B[kj]C[This does not make the black stones any safer (they are safe already), it doesn't put any pressure on white (His stones are now safe too), and it surrounds very little terrioiry.This was the last chance to play at 50, though it isn't as good as earlier, because white has built his stong wall.]
;W[jl];B[ll]
(;W[hn]C[This is also inaccurate. White aims to connect his groups, and maybe capture 2 stones, but he had much bigger moves.]
;B[in];W[im];B[kn]C[So in the end White allows Black to make most of his territory!! Now Black is back in the game.]
;W[io];B[jn];W[ip];B[jp];W[go];B[cd]C[Good. Very big.];W[cc]

(;B[hk]C[No. Black has little prospect of terriory here. The 3-3 point invasion, leading to Ko was playable. The variations show bigger moves.]
;W[hj]C[Unnecessary - Invading immediately was possible];B[fj]
C[This does nothing to prevent the invasion. The one point jump below 5 makes the group secure]
;W[dg]
(;B[ff]C[This does not really solve the problem. White could cut through the knight's move, creating a fight that Black dare not lose. As it is he is happy to allow black to connect in exchange for living on the side - a disaster for Black.]

;W[cg]C[White would like to play at 79 but judges it too dangerous]
;B[bm]C[This is big, but to win balck needed to invade the upper side, with possibilities of cutting off a big group i the centre]
;W[af];B[gg]C[This may be necessary, but it is a shame, because when white gets 82 in place the game is really over.]
;W[he];B[hi];W[kg];B[lg];W[ik];B[hl];W[hm]C[Unnecessary ... the white group below is alive. A play at 89 was much better.]
;B[ld]C[Bette late than never, but this was much stronger before 82 was in place]

(;B[qj]C[Safe, but pushing one more time from 91 would give the option of a monkey jump on either side.]
;W[qc];B[fm]C[Very small. There are many bigger moves. Black should be looking for Sente moves, i.e. moves that white must answer or take a big loss.]
;W[is];B[jr];W[jo];B[ko]C[Most of the endgame is unexceptional. White has a big lead, so he does not need to work hard - siply sealing the edges reasonably efficiently is good enough.]
;W[js];B[ks];W[hs];B[kq];W[be];B[df];W[kb];B[eh]C[Why not 114, capturing 68? Better still a play below 11 enlarging the corner.]

Failure to invade the upper side in good time, 3. Mishandling the play in the centre. 4. Allowing the invasion of the upper right.]
