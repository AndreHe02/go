Hi reviewer,

I played white in this game and did very badly indeed. I've tried to point out where I was unsure about what to do, but I've sent this game for review specifically because I don't know why I lost, even after going through the game (as opposed to losing because of an obvious mistake). I'd appreciate any help you could give me.

Many thanks!

(;W[dg]C[Normally I'd jump straight in at E16, but I thought I'd try this approach instead.

(;B[cl]C[This move is very difficult to deal with as well. The game is pretty much over now, because white never finds time to fix O8.

You spoiled a good opening by creating a weak group on the top. Later you spend 3 moves for defending it. 3 moves played as dame! 

It was a very high price for reducing the top side.])
