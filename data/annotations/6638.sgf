AB[pd][dp]C[Thanks for the review!

I'm not sure what went wrong in this game.  I felt pretty good about my opening but It seems like I didn't follow through on it correctly.

review:  
This review focuses on the opening, as mentioned above.  I don't feel the opening for white was well conceived and white missed some plays in rhythm.  

My goal is to expose some alternate paths to show different shapes coming from moves near the beginning of the game.  And the idea of "sealing" a group and gaining from giving the opponent profit is shown.]

;W[po];B[pp]LB[oo:A][qo:B]TR[ql]C[As this is a 2 stone game, black has stones on both facing corners.  So I think white can choose either option A or B and be fine.  It's a  matter of taste.

I go into detail here because I find Q4 a very interesting move.  The moves A and B may not seem obvious from an opening position as it is.  However, the white move of R8 (marked) is too loose and has little impact.]

;B[oc];W[nb];B[ob];W[jd];B[hc]C[This is a mistake for black.  White needs to make him pay.

The variation shows a powerful way to play.  The lesson here is to see this black stone as a way to create power for white at the cost of only a handful of points, maybe 4 or 5.]

C[White is building a pretty big framework on the right.  Approaching the black stone may not be so exciting because  there is a kind of symmetry there.]

(;W[fq]C[I'd approach from the other side.  There is more profit there, there is nothing on the bottom for white.]

review:
Yes, I agree.  But black still has a weak group that's available for attack.]
;B[dl];W[dj];B[eh]C[The interesting thing in this game for white is the black group at the top.  Black wants white to play D12 here.  Therefore, white must not play D12.]

On a more basic note, notice how white plays the sequence 1-3.  White does not play above 1 as this is small and an end game move.  Black can play above 1, white plays above that and then black must capture in gote.  Making plays like 1 for white and leaving the connection to the end game is a way to gain sente while blocking your opponent from coming up the side.

But because black has the peep at S7, a white extension up this side is not interesting.  White plays 3 to shut black in.]
