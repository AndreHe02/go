C[REQUEST FOR REVIEW
White: RainePlus, 11k KGS provisional (myself)
Black: Dutchman, 12k KGS
[Note: I'm only 11k because I just started this account and this game was the first I played.  I think I'm actually 12k KGS.\]

This was an interesting game...  Very fierce, and very dramatic.  I felt like I was on the defensive for most of this game, as black kept pushing me further and further until I "snapped"...  Snap in this case being surrounding a huge group, engaging in a fight to the death and killing it.  {smile}  I won by a large margin.

Even though the score wasn't close, I feel like I was pushed around most of the game and if black had covered a couple of his weaknesses the game would have been 20 points in his favor.  I also felt like I played far too timidly in fuseki, but during the game I couldn't see a way to play differently that didn't result in overextending myself.

I also have been wondering a lot about my style of play lately.  When I win a game, I often don't know why...  I certainly played well and fought well, but I couldn't say beforehand whether or not I had won until the game ends.  To that end I have recently started to study counting, thinking it will help me decide which moves to play by virtue of reading them and calculating the resulting board.

Finally, I'd like to know how you'd rate my technique.  I have been criticized from time to time for playing bad shape, and although I can read well (When at peak playing condition, I can solve most of the kyu problems on goproblems.com on the first try), I can't necessarily read quickly and sometimes I miss vital lines of play.  I'm not sure if you can see these things from one game, but anything you can say is better than nothing.

I've also interspersed comments throughout the game.  We did not review afterwards, so they should be the only thing in the window.  I also commented on both black and white's moves, as many of them were interesting, though I didn't know his thought process.

-----

Alex: Thank you for all your comments: they were very helpful in reviewing this game.  I will answer your general questions at the end.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]C[Alex: From the next move onwards, I've added quite a lot of variations.  Please don't be intimidated by this: it's just meant to give you an idea of what's possible.  The moves you actually played aren't bad, except maybe for a couple of things that I point out.]

(;W[nc]C[I thought either here or D10 would be an ideal response to the Low Chinese Opening.  I need to experiment more with the high one-space approach...  O16 instinctively looks better to me here.

-----

Alex: This is a good move; see variations for some other ideas.  O17 doesn't work so well here (last variation).]
;B[pf]
(;W[kc]C[Alex: This isn't bad, but it feels slightly uncomfortable because it makes it harder for you to invade effectively at R17.  Compare the variations.]
;B[jp]C[This was huge, but I didn't feel comfortable striking inside a pincer (N4 or Q5), especially with nothing in the center to connect to.  This was the first time during the game that I felt black gave me a big push and I couldn't push back.

-----------

Alex: This is quite a common formation, and it's important not to be intimidated by it.  You must invade or reduce black's framework NOW.  The longer you leave it, the harder it will be!  See variations to the next move for some suggestions.]

(;W[dj]C[This response to black seemed weak.  I wanted to slip in under black's huge influence play (G3, for instance) but I was afraid of losing D10 since it was so large.  D10 also has the advantage of keeping all my stones in one loose group.

-----

Alex: D10 is indeed a big point, but it makes life too easy for black.  The proverb says "play urgent points before big points."  See variations.]
;B[fq];W[dn]
(;B[cc]TR[kc][dd][dj]C[This felt a little early to me...  F17 seems stronger.

-----

Alex: Actually, it looks OK to me.  It's one of the standard ways of reducing a double-wing formation (the triangled stones).  The fact that black keeps sente is important.]

(;W[cd]C[In any case, I choose to protect the left side so my stones on the fourth line have less of a chance to be invaded.  The top is weaker, but the stones on the third line are fairly self-sufficient.

-----

Alex: There are two important things to remember in this position.

Firstly, it's nearly always a good idea to block on the side of your widest extension, becuase that enables you to make the best use of your thickness: see the variation.

Secondly, when you play on the fourth line, your aim is to build thickness in order to be able to fight later in the game.  You should welcome invasions, because they give you a chance to build walls: there will be an example of this later in the game.

If you prefer to defend territory, then you should play your opening moves on 3-4 points.]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[fb];W[gc]
;B[po]LB[qm:a][qp:b][pr:c]C[I no longer see an invasion in the bottom right corner.

-----

Alex: Yes, it's difficult now: that's why D10 was not so good.  On the other hand, white's framework is also rather large, so you don't need a major invasion in order to win--it's good enough if you can just keep black down to a reasonable size.  I would suggest starting at P9.  Depending on what happens, it might later be possible to come in at one of a-c.]
;W[qc]C[Questionable, but I felt that if I didn't strike at this corner now, I'd lose my chance.  It's especially questionable since my own corner in the bottom right is still open, but at least I got some stones behind his.

-----

Alex: see comments to previous move.];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]
;B[oc]
(;W[qd]TR[pf]C[Alex: With the marked stone in place, this doesn't work so well.  See variation.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[rf]
(;W[rd]TR[nc][kc]C[I think this response is needed; I'm not entirely certain.

-----

Alex: yes, it's necessary.  See variation.

Now observe that the two marked stones don't seem to be doing anything useful; it's nearly impossible for you to make territory at the top.  This is why I thought L17 would have been better at K16 instead.]

(;B[cl]C[Alex: I think this is a mistake in direction.  Black can win more simply--see variations.]

(;W[bj]TR[af][bf][bg][ag][ah][bh][bi][ai][ci][ch][cg][ce][de]
[df][dg][dh][di][ed][fd][ee]C[He's really aggressive.  I defend on the top because I want my territory up there to remain intact.  Upon second look, I think defending on underneath would have been better, as D4 and D6 are now potentially weak.

-----

Alex: Try to think about thickness rather than territory.  The triangles mark out about 20 points for you, but you have invested nine stones--this way of playing is too small-scale.  Compare the variation.

Also, the shape of D4 and D6 often turns out to be much stronger than it looks.]
;B[cq]
(;W[dq]C[Alex: correct.  Blocking on the other side would be a disaster.]

(;B[cp]C[Alex: this is a mistake.];W[co];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]
;B[bo];W[bn];B[bp]
(;W[fp]C[I need to make some more space for my weak group here...

-----

Alex: This group is only weak if you let it get sealed in; otherwise, it's thick and strong.  See variation.]
;B[gp]
(;W[gq]C[Alex: double hane is usually a stronger shape here.  See variation.]
;B[hq];W[gr]C[Here I make an eye...];B[go];W[fo]C[This hurts a lot, but I felt I had to play it.

-----

Alex: no, it's still not too late to play D8!];B[gn]
(;W[el]C[So does this.  Again, this was a "no choice" in my mind.  Then again, if I let the C8 stone out, I could follow it to the center of the board and be the first to reach the center...  Maybe I should have done that?

-----

Alex: If you're going to capture C8, playing D8 is a better way to do it, as it takes away a liberty (and avoids the potential ko that you mention later).  But see variations for other ideas.]
;B[nd]C[Alex: After you've invaded the corner, you should be prepared to sacrifice the O17 stone.  Rescuing it deprives black of about four points of territory, and gives you a heavy group to defend.  There are much bigger points on the board.]

(;W[mc];B[md];W[ld]C[N17 hurt, M16 hurt but not so badly.  I'm starting to feel really grim about my chances for success.

-----

Alex: Yes, I agree that black is winning now.];B[le]
(;W[jj]TR[ke][jf][kf][ig][jg][hh][ih][gi][hi][gj][gk][gl][gm]
C[I play Tengen as a result.  I didn't just select this point because I wanted to play the center first...  I imagined black's territorial boundaries extended (marked with triangles) and wanted to play underneath them in an effort to push black back.  Tengen is also nice because it has a star on it.

-----

Alex: Good move.  After your last two plays, the consistent way to make good shape is L15; playing tengen instead is an admission that your last two moves were wrong, and that you need to try a different approach to have any hope of winning.]
;B[kl]
(;W[lj]C[Alex: This isn't so good, because you're just encouraging black to consolidate the territory at the bottom.]
;B[ml];W[ke]C[A bit inconsistent, but I need to deny black access to the left at this point.]
;B[lf];W[nj]C[That done, I continue with my wall.

-----

Alex: ditto previous comment.];B[ok];W[rg]C[Alex: good move.]
;B[qg];W[rh];B[qh];W[sf]
(;B[ri]C[Black is really greedy here...

-----

Alex: yes, R11 is better shape.];W[qf];B[bm];W[an]
(;B[aq]C[I don't think this play was necessary...  Too bad for black; this Ko is important.

-----

Alex: correct.  Compare the variation.];W[pe];B[oe];W[dm]C[I would have liked to fill at R15 immediately, but if black gets D7, then wE7 bC7 creates Ko for life (and possibly death of my group) where I take first.  Unfavorable for black, but since it's a flower viewing Ko for black, I'd just assume not give it to him.  I'm not very good at Ko yet...  I think counting will enable me to use Ko successfully.

-----

Alex: I think you made the right decision here--but now you're wishing you had played D8 instead of E8!]
;B[kf];W[je]
(;B[jg]C[Still very aggressive...  Apparently he wants to punish me for playing too deep.  I figured G10 or something similar would cut me off.

-----

Alex: if he wanted to be _really_ aggressive, he would just play G10 immediately!]
;W[hj];B[hg];W[fh];B[gi]C[This is ridiculous...  Black is completely overextended in my opinion.  I don't see how G11 is beneficial in any manner; I would put it at F14 for better effect, then aim at J15.]
;W[gh]C[Alex: good move.];B[hh];W[hi];B[gk];W[gj];B[hl]LB[hr:a]
[iq:b][ks:c][gf:d]C[Once again he has to drop back to defend, and I use this opportunity to press my attack.

-----

Alex: This seems like a good point to pause and count the territories so far.

Assuming that you're not going to invade at the bottom, the next thing you should do is play white a-black b-white c, which should end in sente for you; then you can fall back and defend at d.

This leaves black with about 80 points at bottom right, 6 at bottom left, 10 at top left and at least 5 around N15, total a bit over 100.

White has about 70 on the left side and top, and 12 at top right, plus 6.5 komi, total just under 90

This leaves you about 15 points behind.  So you need to find some sort of invasion or attack now.]

(;W[gf]C[Alex: ...but this isn't an attack at all!  See variations.]
;B[jr]C[This hurts...  I wanted to exploit that defect later.]
;W[qe]C[A black stone at Q13 would have ended this game with my loss, since I can see no attack in the lower right.

-----

Alex: That's why it's better to play Q13 first and fight the ko (see previous variation).]
;B[qq]C[Apparently black can, but he missed the attack in the upper right.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[ph];B[nh];W[oi]
(;B[qi]C[Alex: This is a mistake.]
(;W[mh]C[Alex: I think this is also a mistake, but I'm not entirely sure--the variations can get rather complicated!]
;B[mg]
(;W[lh]C[Alex: O14 is the key point for life and death, but playing there now doesn't work because the N10 stone is short of liberties--see variation.]
;B[ni];W[oj]
(;B[nk]C[This play confused me.  Isn't it better at N11?

-----

Alex: Yes, N11 looks quite similar to a previous variation.  Black can also live by playing at O14: see variation.]
;W[mi];B[nf];W[me];B[oh];W[og];B[ng];W[pi]C[The black stones are dead now; you have won the game.]

(;W[jd]C[Not sure if this was necessary, but decided not to risk it.

-----

;B[ge];W[ff];B[gd];W[hc];B[fe];W[ee];B[pj];W[kh]C[Alex: why did you play here?]
;B[fk];W[fj];B[ek];W[dk];B[ej];W[ei]C[The game is nearly decided here...  Most of the rest is yose, though there is a patch of interesting plays a bit later.

-----

Alex: the game is definitely decided by now.

Let's count the score once more to make sure:

Black:  bottom right, approx 90 points, bottom left 6, top left 10,
total 106

White: one big group, at least 140 points.];B[kk];W[hk];B[gl]

;W[em];B[ia]C[Here we go.  This monkey jump became interesting because I overlooked the possibility of a connection to the right.]
;W[ib];B[ha];W[ja];B[ka]
(;W[mb]C[I'm not sure if this is a mistake or not.  I think it would have been better played at M19 or K18.  I realized a bit later that I don't need to prevent black from extending up there, only to prevent him from making eyes or connecting.  This play was to prevent N19.

-----

Alex: I think that K18 is the simplest way to play here.  See variation.]
;B[jb];W[jc]C[And this was to maximize territory and ensure that I was still connected to the rest of my stones.  A bit silly in retrospect.]
;B[ma];W[na];B[lb]C[I didn't see this play...  It hurts a lot, as it means Ko for black life.  Thankfully I take first.

-----

Alex: This is now quite an interesting position!  Actually, there's a way to avoid fighting a ko: see variation to move 178.]
;W[lc];B[nb]C[I briefly considered L18 here, but realized that it just succeeds in making a different Ko, but it still makes Ko.

-----

Alex: not so!  See variation to next move.]
(;W[la];B[bf];W[kb]C[After quickly estimating the large black group as about sixty points, I decide that B14 isn't worth 60 and I finish the Ko.  Now I get invaded a bunch, but the game is essentially over.

[qs][rs][ss]C[Alex: You did well to turn this game around and win.  I think that your worst mistakes were in the fuseki, but then you fought hard in the middlegame, from move 64 onwards.

My general impression  of your go style is gentle and safety-conscious.  You described this game as "fierce".  In fact, there was a lot of settled territory early on, and most of the play consisted of pushing at the boundaries rather than major fighting.

You seem to think that your stones are weak when they're not, and so you defend when you could be attacking.

You mention counting: this is a very good idea!  It's a lot easier to make good decisions when you know whether or not you're winning; see my comments at move 97.

Your technique (good shape, reading, etc) seems OK, although it's hard to tell without seeing any complicated fighting.

I think you would benefit a lot from reading through some professional games.  (If you don't have access to books or magazines, you can download sgf files for free from gobase.org)  Look at the openings to get a feel for direction of play and where the big points are.  Look at middlegames and observe how good players are prepared to take big risks when appropriate.  If you think only of making your own stones safe then, whether you win or lose, you are missing much of the excitement of playing go!]
