C[Dear Reviwer,

this is a tournament game I played as black against a German 4 dan.

I think I had a very good start, but I missed a few sharp moves and got tricked, so my opponent could catch up. In the end, he suddenly got a huge territory and even though it became reasonably close again, I had to resign.

I would be very grateful if you could point out my mistakes. I'm especially interested in the correct direction of play as well as shape mistakes.

Thank you very much for having a look!

[EV\] This is your reviewer Eric Vella.  My comments will be marked like this.  This game featured a lot of fighting and not many strategic mistakes for me to comment on, but I will do my best ....]

;B[cq]C[When should I play C3 instead of the usual move at D4?

[EV\] I do not know this joseki, so you will have to consult other sources.  I know professionals have tried this move, but it can easily get way too complicated for me to understand. I think W usually responds F3 to transpose into a standard variation.]
;W[cr]C[This move is supposed to be a mistake, isn't it? Did I punish correctly in the game?]
;B[dp];W[eq];B[ep];W[fp];B[fq]C[[EV\] Now this has transposed into another standard but still difficult joseki.]

(;W[fl]C[Overplay by white?

[EV\] W is behind and has to try something complicated.];B[go]
C[[EV\] More complications .... connecting the ko seems simple and good enough.  W would still have to defend against G6.]
(;W[em];B[ek];W[gn];B[io];W[cl];B[fm];W[hm];B[em];W[in];B[ip]
;W[kn];B[lp]C[[EV\] This looks like a good place to pause and evaluate.  B is safe everywhere and seems likely to get as much territory as W on the bottom half of the board, plus he has two unanswered moves on the top half of the board.  It looks like B has a comfortable lead.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[oq];B[mq]LB[di:a]C[[EV\] I dont think the last two moves were the best use of B sente.  They do create some thickness for an attack on the W center, so I cant really criticize them too much, but that attack is uncertain.  W can still aim at L3, so B has not really increased his side territory, and he has helped W take corner territory.  If B plays elsewhere and lets W get the first move in this area, I dont think the B side will be in much danger.  How about playing somewhere around A, to remove the last chance for W to create trouble?  Objectively that might be a slow move, but I like it here as it would simplify a won game.]

C[[EV\] Sharp move, nice idea if it works.  You could also continue pressing the right corner at A, since the last W move was low.]
;W[mn];B[lm]C[Overplay?

[EV\] Yes, since W found a sente defense.  Also, depending on the continuation, B might prefer later to peep from the other side, since that secures the side territory.]
;W[kp];B[kq];W[mo];B[mp];W[jp];B[jq]C[[EV\] Nice sequence by W.]
;W[jl]C[I didn't expect this move.

[EV\] Vital point for activating the L9 stone.  This greatly changes the balance of power in the center.]
;B[il];W[km]
(;B[ej];W[im]C[[EV\] Now it looks like W is back in the game.]
;B[di];W[po]C[[EV\] W is good at taking reverse sente moves -- a B play at R5 would be nice -- but I think this gives up too much on the left.]
;B[ed]LB[ci:a]C[[EV\] I would play A to make solid territory while attacking.  In saving the lone W stone at C13, W will probably have to concede the corner territory to B anyway.  Also, securing the center group would make B much more confident when it comes time to contest the right side where W is strong.]

;W[bd];B[be];W[bf];B[cf];W[mr]C[This move was really strange.]
;B[dg]C[[EV\] This move would be my first instinct also, but maybe filling the ko is better?  W would have to live in gote, B would take a large corner with no aji, and the center wall would still be strong.]

[EV\] Looks reasonable, but might get slightly overconcentrated after W takes F19 sente.  Moves marked ABCD would also be good.]
;W[pg]C[This move was good... I did not see a good response.]
(;B[nd]LB[kj:a][qi:b]C[This move is probably just boring.

[EV\] Here I would prefer to play A at the pivot point of the two moyos or invade at B while there is still plenty of room to make a base.  But according to my later count, this move also seems OK.]

[ms][ls]C[[EV\] The W moyo is now larger than the B moyo, so I think this is a mistake.  Unless you have counted that this leads to a win, invading seems better.  So lets pause to count ...

If both moyos become real territory, the board would be divided roughly as marked.  B has roughly 60 points in the center moyo and upper side, excluding the corner.  The left side is harder to count, maybe 10 points?  (B would get 20 points if he could play 2 moves, possibly nothing if W plays first, and A13 and A6 are miai.)  Finally B has 8 points on the bottom (assuming W exchanges L1 for K1 in sente).  W has a little over 70 points in the right side moyo and corner, plus another 10 points in the other corners. So from this count, B needs to make up the komi with territory in the upper right corner.  It is W turn to play, but this might still be possible.  Looks like this gives a close game.]
(;W[qd]C[This looked slow to me, even though it was huge...]
(;B[qi]CR[mg][kg][qd][nd]C[[EV\] Good try.  But it would be easier without the marked exchanges.]
;W[qk]LB[qg:A]C[I was not sure what to do now. I carefully read A and the crosscut and found that it is a sure way to win, but I missed a move that was played in the game >_<

[EV\] My first instinct would be to attach at Q9 (play against strength), but I have no idea how that would turn out.]
;B[qg];W[qf];B[pf];W[pe]C[[EV\] This is a really nice move for W, taking charge of the corner.  Now even if B lives inside the W moyo, W still has winning chances.  I think B should try to live without provoking this move.]
;B[of];W[oe];B[ne];W[od];B[rf];W[qe]
(;B[og]C[[EV\] Inconsistent with saving the invasion stones, as you discovered.  B can easily live inside, and the game would still be undecided.]

(;B[ng]C[This?]))
(;B[qc]C[[EV\] Also worth considering.  I think it leads to a close game.]

(;W[li]LB[ji:a][qi:b][qe:c][qf:d][qg:e]C[I felt that white is preferable now.

[EV\] By my count, B could defend at A and the game would be close.  B could probably still try an invasion at B, which would win the game if it lived.  B could also try to get forcing moves like C or D or E in sente, then come back to defend at A, for a win.  Of course W might jump to A, then both sides could destroy each others moyos.  Since B is more solid, I think this would also win.]

(;B[fm]C[I really should play here... the game is a lot better for black now.

[EV\] Yes, definitely, play useful kikashi like this before coming back to a necessary defensive move.  If the game continued like this, B would have a big lead, even better than capturing the corner I think.]
))
(;B[cs];W[em]C[[EV\] Lets assume this continuation for simplicity. W can still rescue part of the corner in gote, so B can count roughly 15 points there.  W has nice outside thickness, possibly 15 points worth.  Is this really much different from the earlier joseki variation which you expected (W move 20 at D6)?]
