;B[pd]C[ If you see another mistakes, please show them
to me.];W[qp];B[cd];W[dq];B[ic];W[co];B[op];W[mq];B[no]C[Per:
Good black should aim for influence there is facing towards his stones at the upper side.
The common joseki is shown in the variation.]
(;W[pq]C[Per:  This is not a good move. When black answers at P3 white has no good answer.]

(;B[qo]C[Per:

Should be at P3 preventing white from connecting his stones is vital !!!!]
;W[oq];B[lp]C[Per:

This an overplay white is to strong here];W[mp]C[Per:

Good fighting move by white];B[mo];W[lo];B[lq];W[mr];B[ip];W[ln]
C[Per:
Now black has to secure his o5 group.]
(;B[pp];W[rp];B[pj]C[Per:

This is too lose white can start an attack with Q6.];W[hq];B[hp]
C[ Which is the best method to attack the two
white stones (M5,M6)?

Per:
Before you start an attack it is very important to have strong groups and to seperate the opponents groups. So my advice is to strenghten your own groups first while keeping white from connecting to M5,M6 and then attack later in the game.]
;W[gq];B[iq];W[in];B[hn];W[jo]C[Per:

This move is a litle strange, but black has to answer if not white will catch two stones with L3 (see var.)
Anyway black is happy to get a chance to play M2.]
(;B[hl];W[dj]C[Per:

White should play the urgent moves before the big moves and keep the presure on the black group.]
;B[ml];W[kl];B[kj]C[Per:

This is good move that builds a moyo at the top.];W[im];B[hm]
;W[ik];B[il]C[Per:

Black should just move out with G10 and leave the aji of J8 to later in the game]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[kk]C[Per:

Now the black stone at L10 is useless];B[km];W[lm];B[jm];W[ll]
;B[io];W[ed]C[Per:

????

White should answer the atari to prevent black from geting eyes with the group]
;B[df];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[bb];W[gc];B[ie];W[nc]C[ Now are three wheak white groups. How can I
manage it?

Per:

Actually the withe center group is not weak because of L3 and Q6.
But white is still making to weak groups which is bad enough.
The general strategy when attacking is to keep the opponent weak an seperated. Don't try to kill white but to gain influence or territorie while attacking.
For one idae for an attack see the variation.]
(;B[nd];W[pc]C[Per:

Eventhoug white gets in the corne black is happy with the influence (see var.)]

(;B[qc]C[Per:   P17 is better];W[od];B[oe];W[oc];B[qd];W[md]
;B[ne];W[kc]C[Per:

This is playable for black too. A move at L15 would be great.]
;B[me];W[ld];B[kf]C[Per:

Allthoug this is big it dosn't prevent white from connecting.]
;W[cg];B[bf]C[Per:

C14 is solid and removes a liberty from white C13];W[dg];B[gj]
C[Per:

????

Now it is blacks turn to make strange moves.
E14 seperates white and moves the black group out.
Black can attack the white center group later.];W[ii];B[dl]
C[ Is this a good atack?

Per:
Well it dosn't really attack anything, but it is a good reducing move.
Right now E14 is the attacking move you should play];W[cl];B[cm]
C[ Is this the good direction?

Per:
Yes];W[ck];B[dm];W[gg];B[mj]C[ Is N10 the great point, or S5?

Per:
Both moves are very big.];W[rn];B[ro]C[Per:

These stones are to weak to defend now.
Black should draw back to R8 and sacrifice some of the stones]

;W[mm];B[nm];W[np];B[nl];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[dp]C[ Is there another greater move for black?

Per:
Black should do something to protect the J17 stone.
White can cut using the sequence wK16, bJ16 and wK15.];W[cp]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[fp];W[do];B[fq]C[Per:

Black should have now problems winning this game now.];W[fo]
;B[go];W[fn];B[fm]C[Per:

F8 is better shape because white G6 is sente.
Right now white has a very annoying move at F9];W[cb];B[ba]
