C[Hello, I'd like to thank the reviewer in advance for taking your time to review this game. I guarantee you that i will study this game very will and try my best in improving my go.



I've been trying to improve lately but it seems to be going a bit slow, any tips or suggestions will be appreciated. Thank you.



[NOTE\] I played black in this game.

s: Hello.  I play as samtregar on KGS at 9k and occaisonally at the New York Go Center at 3k.  I will prefix all my comments with "s:".  Please keep in mind that I'm not a very strong player, and there are still many things I do not know about Go!  Feel free to show my review to a better player if you have any doubts about my analysis.  You can also contact me at sam@tregar.com with any questions.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[fc]LB[dj:C][pj:A][co:B]C[s: certainly playable, although A or B is more usual.  Something around C is also reasonable.]
;W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[id]LB[ic:A]C[s: A is much simpler.  Your shape is not yet stable and you'll probably have to do something later to resist attack.]
;W[dk]TR[dd][dq]C[s: white has something like a high-chinese fuseki here with the marked stones.  When I get my copy of "The Chinese Opening" maybe I'll know what that really means.  One thing I know is that it means white is very high - almost all on the fourth line - and therfore looking for influence rather than territory.]
;B[pj]C[s: a big play];W[jq];B[co]LB[ch:B][ci:A][do:C]C[s: this looks like the right idea to me.  Other possibilities might be A, B or C.]
;W[cm];B[cq]LB[eo:A]C[s: this worked ok, but did you consider jumping into the middle with A?  You shouldn't have any trouble living since you've got a lot of influence on the right.  I think this play lets white seal you in, which isn't very good so early in the game.  On the other hand, you got some of white's corner, so you can't be blamed.]
;W[dp];B[cp];W[do];B[mq]LB[fe:D][ch:B][hp:C][nq:A]C[s: this seems small, and too far at the same time.  If you want to help secure your corner then A is the play.   But really I think something bigger wiould be better...   Maybe B, C or D?  B seems really urgent to me...  If white plays there you'll have a hard time invading.]
;W[nc];B[lc]LB[pc:B][pf:A]C[I thought a low pincer here would be nice due to the stone at J16

s: yes and no.  This shows why J16 was a mistake.  If you had played J17 then you could answer this more calmly at either A or B.  Now white has forced you to play a fairly small move just to protect your shape.]
;W[ne]LB[qc:A]C[s: the next move is usually A in a situation like this...]
;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[mb];B[lb];W[mc]LB[oc:A]C[s: yuck, empty triangle.  Any time you see your oponent do this you should look for ways to attack the shape, since it is now one liberty weaker!  For example, a move like A just became more threatening.  I'm not strong enough to lay out a sure attack, but I know I'd be looking for one.]
;B[ng]C[s: good move, puts preasure on white and expands your territory]
;W[ld];B[jc]LB[kd:A]C[s: I think A would work just as well and get you more territory]
;W[kd];B[fe];W[jo];B[kp];W[jp]LB[go:B][ip:A]C[When white has a wall of three stones facing eachother like that... am i suppose to invade between them??

s: white didn't have two walls till you forced him to have two walls!  Why did you play L4 to force white to become strong?  Before L4 a move at A would have been a good start to a reduction.

s: now a move around B would be a reduction but your chance for invasion is definitely gone.]
;B[jf]LB[ch:A]C[s: very small move.  white is quite safe with multiple ways to get two eyes.  you should focus on the left side now and invade around  A.]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[lf];B[jg];W[lg];B[mi];W[lh];B[eh]LB[ch:A][dh:B]
C[s: you seem to think that white has the entire left side as territory, but mostly he just has influence.  Rememebr, stones on the fourth line do not guarantee territory - usually you can (and must!) mount an attack from inside by playing on the third line.  A play at A would be much better, but B would also be ok.]
;W[dh]LB[ch:A]C[s: white is too greedy!  A move at A would be much calmer and stop your invasion.]
;B[di];W[ei];B[dg];W[ch];B[ef];W[cg];B[cf];W[eg];B[de];W[ce]
;B[dg];W[fh];B[df]C[Here i was just trying to break into white's 4th line territory, i don't know if that was a good idea or not...

s: white had no fourth line territory here until you gave him some!]
;W[be];B[bf];W[cb];B[ai]C[s: much too earlier for a monkey jump.  this it worth around 10 points but there are still bigger moves on the board.  This is an endgame move.]
;W[bg]C[s: this is not the way to answer a monkey jump!];B[ag]
;W[ae];B[af];W[eb];B[fb];W[da];B[ji]C[s: another very small move.  I don't see that this gets you any points at all!]
;W[pm]C[s: HUGE move from white at this stage of the game..  imagine if you had played there first...]
;B[ol]LB[ql:A]C[s: I think A would work better.];W[om];B[qn]
LB[qq:A]C[s: good move - protects your corner (although white can still play A) and puts preasure on white.]
;W[qm];B[lm]LB[ko:A]C[s: terrible move.  white can still escape because of the weakness at A, or make life along the side.  This move does nothing that I can see.]
;W[nn];B[nm]LB[nl:A][mm:B];W[oo];B[op];W[mm];B[nl];W[ln]LB[ml:A]
C[s: white is in too much of a rush.  He should play A to get in some extra damage before escaping.]
;B[ml];W[mn];B[km];W[kn];B[jm]C[s: white has escaped and done a great deal of damage in the process.]
;W[in];B[hl]C[s: this move begs white to secure his territory while giving you very little in return.]
;W[gm];B[gj]TR[hj][ij][jj][kj][hk][ik][jk][kk][lk][il][jl][kl]
[ll]C[s: I think maybe you made this move to make some territory in the center.  I've marked out the territory.  It's just 14 points and white will get sente forcing you to protect it while finishing his bottom moyo!  14 points is too small for all the gote moves you played to create it.]
;W[hh];B[qq]C[s: good move.  a play there by white would be very dangerous to you.]
;W[rj]C[s: good response by white.  you left you skirt open and white is sneaking in.]
;B[rl]LB[qh:A]C[s: ???  the only moves are around A, as far as I know]
;W[ql];B[qk];W[pn]LB[rk:A];B[rh]LB[rk:A][qo:B]C[s: A or B is called for...  I think A is bigger.]

s: I think it might be.  Without it I think white can get a seki with a play there.  However, I'm pretty bad at life and death puzzles, so yuo might want to ask a better player.  I played out one variation that you can look at.]

s: I'm not sure what you mean by black being in control during the early game.  I pointed out a number of points where black gave away sente with small moves in the middle.  However, white made a big game-losing mistake which was failing to respond to your monkey jump correctly.  White did play well in the endgame, but the game was basically over by then anyway.

s: To improve, you should study openning strategies and also how to invade during the middle game.  Reading games played by higher ranking players on the GTL is a good way to do that, as is reading books on Go like "In the Beginning". 
s: I hope this review has been useful to you.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.]
