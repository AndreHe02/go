Hello, I will be you commentator today.
-----

Hi; I'm playing for white. I'm trying to keep my groups alive. I'm also trying not to think "kill". Instead I'm trying to think, "let him live in a small area. I heard that that is a better stratagy.

B: had a group on the fence. I tried to keep him in a small area. however, it got into a ko fight and I didn't know what to do.
--------
W.
In the game, it feels like you forced him to play this ko fight and then abandoned the ko. Tactically speaking, it would have done you much more good to protect the ko, and let him struggle to live (I am not sure he actually could, without that ko)
---------

Also, Later in the game B had a large area on the r side. I wasn't sure what to do. I didn't want to play inside because I thought that I would be simply wasting stones.
---------
W.
The main problem in your game, I think, is that you play too many small/gote moves. You could be much stronger if you stopped playing those ! Seeing that a move is actually small or (and) gote is a skill that you can practice with life and death problems, but also by taking your time.

I know this game was blitz, but 20 seconds is more than enough to see that a move isn't sente. 

You should also check if your opponent played a sente move, too, if you can ignore it. 

This alone would make you gain much, I think. You lose this game mostly because of that.]

Wow, let me quote you : 

"I'm also trying not to think "kill". Instead I'm trying to think, "let him live in a small area. I heard that that is a better stratagy."

this move is only possible if you are sure to kill, or to get a very large compensation from the ko. 

There's another problem with this move, and that is that it is not even necessary to kill black, locally, black only has one eye at g13...]

how would you deal with this move ?]))
(;W[hp]C[W. this is the tesuji here =)]))
(;W[qp]C[W.
personally, I would play here (this better than sansan (r3) when the side is more important. 

You can see follow-ups here :

Would you be unhappy if black took three stones in gote ? personally, it would seem like black passed again. (d13 was also a passing move, to me)]
))
(;W[kj]C[W.
Also, it doesn't like black can live easily here, and if he gets only 2 points, who cares ? 

Remember that moves on the outside (l10) are often much bigger than move on the inside (g13)]

(;W[ej]C[W. What about blocking from this side ? It seems like a better shape to me]

(;W[fb]C[W. blocking here is sente againt black's corner, it also looks quite big]
