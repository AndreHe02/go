C[Blue: Hi reviewer, and thanks. My comments are sprinkled throughout. However, feel more than free to comment on any other aspect of the game.

Kirsten: Hi Blue, I also made a lot of comments on Black's side. I think he often played much too softly, which made it too easy for you too get away with mistakes.]

(;W[cj]C[Blue: I wasn't certain about this move. If I want to extend from the top left to protect, is this the best place? Given the D4 stone? Or is it safe, in which casre should I do something bigger?

Kirsten: If you want to play on the left side this is the right place for an extension. But I would prefer playing an approach move against Q3 now. There remains a weakness on C12 then, but it's only a territorial aspect, your stones don't have to worry.]
;B[lc]C[K: I think B should have played j17 instead of m17, then he can leave out m17.]
;W[po]C[Blue: Would a low approch have been better? Are there any general guidelines as to which is for which situation? What are the aims of each?

K: This is fine. I don't know about general guidelines, only one thing: If black has an extension around K4, Q5 is not so good most times, because it can be attacked easily. Then a wider approach at Q7 or R7 is preferred.]
;B[pm];W[no]C[Blue: I don't know the 3-4 josekis very well. This is just something I have to learn.

K: Me neither.]
(;B[op]C[K: this blck move is not joseki, so there should be a good way to handle it.]

(;W[lo];B[mp];W[mo];B[kq];W[jo]C[K: This groups is being hunted much too long. There were various possiblities to make life, for example with te cut. Which is still open. This way you are giving B to much solid territory at the bottom.]

(;W[qh]C[Blue: Foolish?

K: Doing something about B's moyo now is urgent. But R12 is too low, you should play like this if you have the space for a 2-point-extension.]

(;B[qk]C[K: S9 wasn't sente at all, and it still didn't do anything for the group's life, there's only one eye at the side, which was also there without S9.]

(;B[jj];W[hh];B[jl];W[dq]SQ[ei][ek][gk][dm][hm][fn]C[Blue: Before this move and the next, I was (apparently) winning. I chose this move to get points. Was it a bad choice? The next invasion cost me a lot.

K: I don't think you were winning. The marked area is neutral area. But I think D3 is ok, it's miai, you lose territory either on the side or in the corner.]

;B[gq];W[fp];B[fq];W[eq];B[gn]C[K: I think C18 is the biggest move now, regarding sente and gote in the continuations it's worth more than 15 points.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[qc]C[Blue: This just didn't work. It may have if I hadn't played P15 first...

K: P15 was aji keshi, that's right, but in this case I think R17 shouldn't have worked anyway:]

;B[cb];W[bb];B[hm];W[hj]C[Blue: The game basically enters endgame now. I made a few msitakes after this which may have sot me the game considering how close it was. Any big moves I missed? Tesujis I should know?

K: Well, B got C18 which was very big. Everything looks solid now on both sides, and I think your endgame was much better than B's, B is more than 5 points ahead now.  I will end the commentary here.
The main problem in this game were your 2 running groups. The first created some influence on the outside  towards the top, but it was no compensations for B's territory at the bottom. The second group got out better than it should have, If B had attacked it better he could have started further attacks for example on the left side. Because of your running groups B had the time to make solid territory, also at the top.

I hope you enjoyed the review and it could help you a little bit. If you have any more questions on the game feel free to ask me again.
