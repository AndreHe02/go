C[Hello dear reviewer,

I am Oceandrop (white) 3k on KGS, and recently I loose many of my games and feel like I have forgot something very important but I can't pin down what it is. This game I send to you is a very calm one, and I can't find out by myself what my mistakes were except the obvious ones, so I hope I can learn and maybe even break my losing streak with your help. Maybe I just need more fighting spirit and invade more aggressive against the weak points of my opponnent to learn and get experience on how to play better even if I loose more games at first, but I don't know. Thanks for the review already beforehand!

JK: The Take-Away

1) You need to look for ways of attacking weak groups, using them to gain territory, or (as in this game) influence that would help out your own weak group.

2) When you get into a dire situation, you need to take care to read a lot, and look for the dangerous moves that both you and your opponent could play.

In addition, I commented on the opening. After the group was killed, I gave a few comments, but that was most of it.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[cf];W[fc];B[dj]C[OD: I heard of this Fuseki before, but the only thing I know is that approaching close with E3 would be not optimal, so I choose to approach one further away, to avoid being attacked severely.

JK: The long-knight's jump approach is perfect for this situation. The problem with a close approach is that there is already support on the left for a pincer, so White begins on a bad foot.]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[ep];B[dq]LB[bd:F][ef:G][ch:E][qn:D][fp:A][gp:B]
[nq:C]C[JK: Here you have a number of options. The option you chose, solidly connecting at A, is perfectly fine. B is another local option. Playing tenuki at C, hoping to come back and defend the cutting point. Playing D is a probe, and helps decide whether you should play A or B.

If Black ignores your move, and cuts at A in response to C or D, it is no big deal. You can continue to pincer the corner, and then extend to g3 and settle your group, or Black will spend a second move there, giving White a chance to develop the right or even invade at E.

It is important to note that if Black plays G before White gets a chance to invade, White F is almost required.]

(;W[fp];B[cn]LB[jp:A][jq:B]C[JK: Here you have a choice to make: high or low?
White usually chooses to play high in two situations: when there is a large open point left on the baord, or when he has support in the bottom right corner. If there is a very large opening point, it then falls on Black to decide, to I tenuki and take the large point, or do I approach the White position on the bottom. In the game, he choose to approach.]
;W[jp]C[OD: I was not unhappy about this, because blacks formation on the left has many gaps, though I was quite unable to use those gaps succesful later, I was unsure about when the timing was right for invasion, and how I could profit or at least do it succesfully, I feel like I lack some knowledge and experience how to play against an opponnent that develops faster but with more gaps in his formations, I always feel like I fall behind in such game.]
;B[lq]LB[qj:A]C[JK: Now the second stipulation when playing high because there is a large opening point is that you basically have to tenuki here and take it. The largest theoretical point on the board here would be A.

If you are unwilling, or unprepared to tenuki, that you should not play high. It would just be giving Black a free move on the bottom, and he gets the large point anyway :(]

(;W[jr]TR[jo][jq]C[OD: Was K2 too slow on my side and I should have ignored M3?

JK: Already discussed, but not the difference in effectiveness between this shape, and one where White occupies the two triangled points instead. When there is no point bigger than the bottom, or you do not want to tenuki, playing the low position and then jumping up gives you a much better shape.]
;B[nc];W[qf]C[JK: Good, forcing him to develop the boring top, while staking your claim on the wide open right.]
;B[pb];W[qc];B[kc];W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[qk]LB[pj:A]C[JK: Your position on the right seems very low, meaning you kill not end up with a lot of influence. While it is good to have safe territory, it is important to keep a good balance of both territory and influence. Maybe playing the marked stone at A instead would be a little more dynamic.]
;B[kr]LB[bd:C][jq:A][kq:B]C[As for responding on the bottom, you have the solid A, or the more forcing B. You could also ignore it to take a big point like C.]

(;W[jq]LB[mr:a]C[JK: Safe, and there is a weakness in Black's shape at N2.]

(;B[bd];W[cc];B[ef]LB[ch:B][cl:A]C[JK: Your easiest invasion into his side is now stiled rather greatly. There still remains some aji with c8, but a direct invasion at c12 no longer works]
;W[ic];B[qh];W[of];B[oh]C[So here Black has given you a weak group, and you will be able to benefit if you attack it. It's main support is to the bottom, because you can press down the top rather easily.]

(;W[qb];B[oc];W[cl];B[bj];W[el];B[en]LB[fn:B][gn:A]C[B is a lot more vigorous here.]

(;W[nj];B[ng];W[nk];B[nf];W[mi];B[hi]LB[nc:b][oh:B][fk:D][gm:A]
[mr:C]TR[ro][rq]C[OD: I feel already behind here, but I can't understand what I did wrong, what opportunities did I miss? I hope you can help me out.

JK: By not playing as sharply as possible in the fight with group A, you put yourself in the unfortunate position of being under attack and having no weak groups to pressure.

By allowing B to connect to b, you lost an opportunity to Coutner attack.

There is still Aji around C, but Black getting the marked exchange helped him defend. You should ignore s3, it is just a gote endgame move.

D is in immediate danger, and the solid wall with A means cutting through the one space jump is possible. You must play very solid.]
