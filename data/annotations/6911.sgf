;B[qd]C[[J\] Hi, my name is Jorik Mandemaker and I will review this game as requested by white. I have marked my comments in the game with a [J\], I've also added some variations so make sure you configure your SGF editor to show them. In case I use some (japanese) terms you don't understand you can look them up at http://senseis.xmp.net]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[cq];W[dq]C[[J\] Black's last move is very unusual. D3 is the right answer.]
;B[cp];W[do]C[[J\] You can play C5 here.];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
;W[eq];B[fr];W[es];B[jp]
(;W[oc]C[[J\] You can kill the lower left group. See the variation.]
;B[od]
(;W[lc]C[[J\] This move is a mistake. Black just attached to your stone. If you let black play there again he could weaken your stone a lot. O16 is the right move. See the variation for the joseki.]

(;B[jc]C[[J\] This is a very agressive move by black. He should have played at Q17 to punish your mistake. See the variation.]

(;W[le]C[[J\] Not a bad idea, running out with a weak group. But since black didn't play Q17 you still have the chance to grab O16 and Q17 yourself now.]
;B[je];W[oe]C[[J\] Better at O16.];B[pe];W[nd];B[pd];W[ne];B[pg]
;W[qn]C[[J\] This move is quite odd. The normal way to approach the lower right corner is at P3 or P4. Alternatively you could attack the two black stones at the top. G17 looks good for that.]
;B[op];W[qk];B[qi];W[ok];B[oi];W[on]C[[J\] I like this move. It's very solid. It's a good idea to not leave weak groups near your opponents strength.]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[pl];W[pk];B[po];W[pn];B[nn];W[nm];B[no];W[mm]
;B[ro];W[rn];B[sn];W[sm];B[sp];W[rl];B[rj];W[pc]C[[J\] This move isn't very big or urgent. It's better left for the endgame.

The biggest area right now is the left side. Also the two black stones at the top don't have a solid base yet. Playing an attack on the black stones or playing on the left are a lot bigger.]
;B[qc];W[qb]C[[J\] Again better left for the endgame.];B[rb]
;W[pa];B[cf]C[[J\] Now black beats you to the left side.];W[ch]
C[[J\] The left side is big so I like the pincer.];B[cc];W[cd]
;B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[dc]
(;W[ec]C[[J\] This is a mistake. Thanks to the black stone on C14 you have to play E16.]

(;B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[df];B[hc];W[gb];B[gc];W[hb];B[ib];W[ed]
;B[ga]
(;W[jn]SQ[gf][hf][ig][jh][kh][li][mj]C[[J\] What is your aim with this move? I suppose you are trying to build a moyo in the center. But this is very hard.

You would have to close the border at the bottom but also the border along the top. I've marked it with squares. That's not going to happen. Black can easily jump in and escape to either the top or the right group.

If you want to build a moyo you should try to build it on the left instead. It's easier to make territory on the sides than it is in the center afterall.

Intead of building a moyo you could also invade black's moyo. He has a very large weakness at H3. See the variations.]
;B[ho]C[[J\] Now black just patches up his weaknesses.];W[hm]
;B[fo];W[em];B[ko];W[kn];B[mh];W[pf]C[[J\] This won't really lead anywhere. It's best to either move your group out into the center -with M13 for example- or you could play tenuki and build a moyo.]
;B[qf];W[of];B[kg]C[[J\] Now your group on the top is shut in and black has gotten a lot of stones on the outside. The wall you have build in the bottom is rather ineffective.]
;W[og];B[oh]C[[J\] Woah! Big mistake here. This should definatly be at P12 instead.]

(;W[qg]C[[J\] Good you can get something here.];B[ph];W[rf]
;B[re];W[qe];B[se];W[qf];B[sc]
(;W[sf]C[[J\] Black can now live by playing S16. If you play S16 yourself he would be dead.]
;B[rc]C[[J\] Black misses the way to live.];W[ra]C[[J\] Good.]
;B[ld];W[md];B[kd]
(;W[kb]C[[J\] This move isn't very big. You should try to cut off the black group on the right off.]
;B[kc];W[lb];B[jb];W[nh]C[[J\] The right idea.];B[ni];W[ng]
;B[mg]
(;W[mf]C[[J\] why defend here? Black has nothing. Cut him up at N11.]
;B[kf];W[lg]C[[J\] N11 is still the key point.];B[lh]C[[J\] N11 is the last chance to cut.]
;W[lf]
(;B[ke]C[[J\] Black could have defended all his cutting points with L11.]
;W[mj]C[[J\] Don't peep when you can cut. Just cut black at N11.]
;B[mi];W[lj];B[cj]
(;W[dj]C[[J\] Cutting at L12 is  better. Black's right group will probably die. And even if it doesn't you should be able to build up a lot of strength and kill the stone on the left.

On a more fundamental level. You want to attack the lone black stone. Contact moves only help black strengthen his stone. Attack from a distance. See the variations.]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[ej];W[di]
(;B[ei]C[[J\] See the variation for black.];W[ek];B[dh];W[ci]
;B[eh];W[dl];B[ef];W[dg];B[eg];W[de]C[[J\] This move is not needed.]
;B[fe];W[fk]C[[J\] You can still cut at L12 allthough it has become hard thanks the black's new wall.]
;B[fj];W[gj];B[gi];W[hj];B[hi];W[ij];B[ji]C[[J\] Now the cut is protected.]
;W[ii];B[ih];W[jj];B[ki];W[kj];B[hn];W[gm];B[ae];W[bf];B[af]
;W[ag];B[ad];W[bh];B[ai];W[ah]C[[J\] No need. Black can't do anything.]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[bn];W[bm];B[bo];W[cm];B[fn];W[fm]C[[J\] This isn't very big. F1 is much bigger.]
;B[en];W[dn];B[in];W[im];B[ln];W[lm];B[lo];W[li];B[rk];W[jh]
C[[J\] This should lead nowhere, but black made a few mistakes.]
;B[kh];W[hh];B[jg];W[gh];B[fi];W[gf]
(;B[hg];W[gg];B[ge];W[hf];B[ig];W[he];B[hd];W[fd];B[gd];W[ee]
;B[ie]C[[J\] Black should defend at F14. There shouldn't be a seki.]
;W[ff];B[if]C[[J\] Seki in sente. That's a very good result. Black could have prevented it though.]

(;W[ja]C[[J\] F1 is by far the biggest move on the board.];B[ia]
;W[ka];B[jl];W[jm]C[[J\] There is no need to defend.];B[kl]
;W[ll]C[[J\] Again not needed.];B[ik];W[gk]C[[J\] And again.]

;B[as];W[bp];B[fs];W[gn];B[go];W[tt];B[cg];W[bg];B[ak];W[bi]
;B[tt];W[tt]C[[J\] White won quite comfortably in the end. My overall advice would be:

1) Study some opening theory. You made some very odd moves in the opening and also some very small moves. 
Don't go memorizing joseki though. The book "In the beginning" is a good read for someone of your strength. See http://senseis.xmp.net/?InTheBeginning

2) Study life and death. You could have killed the lower left group and black could have lived in the upper right which you could have prevented. www.goproblems.com has a lot of problems that you can solve interactively. It's a great place to learn.

3) You made a lot of unnecessary defensive moves in the endgame and late midgame. Try to learn when you have to defend and when you don't have to. Studying tesuji could help.]
