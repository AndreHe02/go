C[diorn [17k\]: hello

Brodie: Alright, a few things to keep in mind are: 

1)  Try to avoid moves like A7.  That was an endgame move; Black could have just ignored you and played somewhere important, which would not be very good.  Likewise, try to take advantage of that if you have an opponent who does it.

Actually, keep trying to cut back on small pointless moves in general!  ;-)

2)  Try not to touch invading stones.];B[dd]C[Tengu04 [16k\]: hi]

;W[gr]C[Brodie:  I think D5 is better.  I would be concerned that black would play at D6 or D7 here.  E2 is small, so there's little reason for black to play a move like F1.  It does, however work out okay for you.]

(;B[fs];W[ir];B[pc];W[pd];B[oc];W[ne]C[*With this move i was aiming to reinforce the side while still moving out into the center.

Brodie:  Yes, I like this move, it works well with Q10.];B[nd]
;W[cn]C[Brodie:  This is an important play.  I, myself, would be tempted to spend a move reenforcing N15 and P16.   This is probably better though!]

;B[ba];W[ca];B[ad]C[Brodie: This basically throws away a liberty which lets you capture B15 a little easier; not so good.......]

;B[ag]C[*good play on his part

Brodie: Or is it? It's only worth about 5 or 6 points.  L14 or N15 might be better options for black.  There's also O3 and such.  The point is, A13 is small!]
;W[af];B[bg];W[he];B[ge]
(;W[je]C[Brodie:  These 3 white stones look a little ackward.  I assume the idea was trying to build up "thickness", but this doesn't seem to cut it.]
;B[id];W[ek]C[* and the jump];B[ej]C[this is not what i expected, but it works out for me i think, no i can further separate the two black stones and develop some territory by pushing toward the center, without losing the E9 stone]

(;W[jh]C[*jumped off the three stones above to develop the area around o12, wasn't sure if this was a good idea tho, anything that could have been better, i felt that the normal hane would cause trouble for my three stones above

Brodie:  There's no doubt that the three white stones will be open for attack, especially if you keep letting black build up a wall.  However, I really dislike the idea of letting black push through..]

Brodie:  Other than goofing up killing S13,  not taking the KO for so long!!,  it was a pretty good game.

Black was very nice to you, and you did a good job taking advantage of that.
