C[Hi Bob,
I presume you want real advice and constructive criticism, please
do not take any of my comments personally, just see it as part of
the learning process.

Also, I thought I'd throw in some of the lessons I learned that
were worth many ranks of skill to me. I hope you will forgive me
for rambling on here!
1) Never assume your opponent is as bad as the mistake they just
made. People earn their ranks for a reason and you can easily
lose a game by scoffing at someone because they've made a bad
mistake. I personally have gone on to win many games that I began
with a 30-50 point mistake! Also, if you think your opponent has
made a big mistake, look twice, look thrice, look again, it might
be something done on purpose.

2) Don't try to kill your opponent's groups. This leads to
failure most of the time. It is much better to make their group
run to the center and gain some territory and influence in the
meanwhile. It's also better to securely close them in away from
the center, especially if you can do it in sente.

3) Play with clear goals in mind: Where is the most important
move on the board? What gains the most territory, what is my
opponent's best move here, where am I weak, where is my opponent
weak.

4) Read lots of books, study many problems, observe as many 4d*
and higher games as you play (or more.) The more you read and the
more you observe (especially after reading) the faster you learn.
I've studied about 15 go books.

5) Getting upset is like giving your opponent a two-stone
handicap. I know one player on IGS who started playing go about
five months before I did. This player often flies into rages and
after one game I won with him he told me he didn't want to ever
speak with me again. He is still 18k and I am now 8k. He has
played more than 2000 games on IGS and I have played less than
600 games. Clearly it's not just "game-playing doth a go player
maketh."

6) Don't use 'trick' moves. If you ever want to be 1d or higher,
rest assured that trick moves do not work with 1d or higher
opponents and it is a bad idea to learn to use them. I have found
that at about 8k-9k I get in trouble with trick moves more often
than they help me, especially because my opponents purposefully
act like they've been fooled and then turn the tables.

7) If you're serious about learning, always review your own
games. Use a program like WinIGC that can split off duplicate
boards for you to play variations. Try those daring moves you
didn't risk during the game. Look at the finished game and
determine where you went wrong and where your opponent went
wrong, then go back and find better moves for both of you.
Learning to cope with your opponents' better moves helps you
choose your own better moves.

8) Don't use duplicate boards to play variations during your
games. Do you think 5d players use duplicate boards? I don't
think so. The better you can visualize the board in your mind the
better you'll play. Using duplicate boards during a game is like
using a training wheels too long--you never learn to ride. Some
people also consider it cheating and would be angry to find you'd
done it during a game with them.

9) Don't play more than 2 or three games in a row. Give your mind
time to assimilate what's happened during the games. Sleep on it.

10) If you get frustrated or feel you aren't progressing fast
enough, take a break! Don't think about go for a week or a month.
Then come back. You may be surprised to find how the break was as
good a study method as hitting the books! I've seen this
phenomenon in my own life in other things, such as playing piano,
programming, etc.

Hope this helps!

;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq];B[oq]C[Bumping his stone violates the saying "Do not attach to a weak stone." The result is usually that you strengthen it. There are only a few situations in which it makes sense to attach to a weak stone, and if you can think of any other acceptable moves, perhaps you should use them first. I took some lessons from Yilun Yang and even at the 8k level I was attaching to weak stones. There was only ONE time that he ever approved of the move.]
;W[np];B[jd];W[qq];B[pq]C[Attaching to a weak stone is again perhaps not the optimal move. I would prefer a move such as P2 which both defends your stones and makes o3 a target. Also, the "empty triangle" shape is a heavy one and I would avoid it unless there is a compelling reason not to.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[pn];W[rm]C[Your opponent got a free corner! Your line of black stones is now heavy because they control little territory and extend little influence. To make use of them you could perhaps have played on the bottom, perhaps at L3. If you can make white's adjoining group weak, then you have made your stones useful.]
;B[no]C[Attaching here isn't so much 'against a weak stone' but it does lave your own stone weak. This does help you attach to the center and creates a possibility for a large moyo but you must follow up on it properly.]
;W[kq]C[White has now secured the weak stones on the bottom with incredibly low cost. his four stones on the right look like about  9-10 points of territory. White's three stones on the bottom should live and promise at least 5 points of territory. It's becoming very crucial that your six stones DO something besides prevent white from getting the 10-12 points of territory that they 'occupy' (but do not claim.) A move like J3 could force white to force you to play in the center and develop a moyo, or could let you establish a position on the bottom left that keeps white's bottom small. I also might consider M5.]
;B[qc]C[This is not a bad way to anchor your corner stone.  However, D10 is the most important point on the board. The Q16 stone is not all that weak because of its neighbors at Q10 and K16. If white took D10 I would say w would be clearly in the lead.]
;W[rj]C[This move of white's is also improper. The point to play is still D10 (or perhaps C10, I'm not sure).]
;B[qf]C[This move is heavy, given the presence of R17. It does not defend well against white's extension on the bottom, and still isn't D10. In this case I might say that S11 or R10 would be appropriate since you can cleanly cut white off from your upper territory, but I think R11 or R12 are the best moves.]
;W[qi]C[This shows how R14 is not a good defensive move against S10.]
;B[pi];W[qh];B[ph];W[pl];B[om]C[This move is overly defensive. White is not completely joined
You could play P8 or R7 and still be safe: you have a ladder breaker at K16 and if white gets out you can cut off R3 with a good chance to kill. Play out some variations so you can see what I mean.]
;W[ol]C[White is now completely out, taking advantage of the defensive move at P7. Your bottom group is now weak with no eyes and no easy connection to safety. White's weakness at R8 is gone.]
;B[nm];W[nl];B[ml];W[mc]C[White has really got you going now! You can still be cut at N7. Although you have one eye on the bottom, the group is still weak. N4 would be a decent sacrifice move, threatening to cut off white's two stones, giving you an extra stone at the bottom to help cover that group. White should have played on the left side at D10 still. I would play N9 or D10 here.]
;B[kc]C[This is a defensive move that squeezes white properly, that is, without contacting white's stone. White should play N15 now.]
;W[ob]C[P18 is ok, but your best move is now N15, keeping white inside.]
;B[pb]C[Don't attach to a weak stone...it strengthens it. :)]
;W[lb];B[kb]C[Same thing again. If you are going to play on the top, play at G17 or F17!]
;W[oc];B[fc];W[cf]C[White has now invaded both of your positions (prematurely, I should add) and is looking to get some nice territory on the left and bottom... it's up to you to prevent this. This move is appropriate for white because of your approach at F17.]
;B[cn];W[fq]C[White is certainly going to have a big bottom here.]
;B[bp];W[od];B[pe];W[oe];B[of];W[pc];B[qb]C[This move is only useful in preventing white from getting eyes. Q18 is an unimportant stone and you should play elsewhere, such as C9 which is begging for you to play it. I have learned that it is almost always better to go for territory rather than to go for a kill. Squeezing or chasing a weak group is ok as long as another objective is clearly supported in the process.]
;W[me]C[White is concerned about this group living, so this move isn't a bad one.]
;B[fe]C[This move is the kind you'd play if you're trying to create influence or build up a large moyo. However, C9 is still waiting to be played.]
;W[dc]C[Now's your chance to play C9!];B[if]C[This gave up sente too easily. First play urgent moves, then play big moves, then play influence and expansion moves.

If you wanted to play on top, I think L14 would have been better. However, I still think you should have played on the left side.]
;W[ci]C[White gets the nice move on the side and J14 isn't as efficient as it could be. Note that white made a two-space extension, just like the C9 move for you would have been a two-space extension.]
;B[ck];W[cq];B[cp]C[Your group was not weak, C4 is unnecessary. Play at N13 or L5 or D12...]
;W[hp]C[White properly ignored your bump and secured more territory on the bottom.]
;B[do];W[ep];B[fh];W[eb];B[fb];W[fa];B[ga];W[ea];B[hb]C[You must connect, this is a proper move. However, consider L19. L19 is still close enough to defend the G18 cut and it saves you some territory, and attacks the N17 group at the same time. White is making endmoves early.]
;W[bj];B[bk];W[ka]C[Here's where H18 cost you some points.]
;B[ja];W[la];B[ld]C[Forcing white to connect here does nothing for your position, and gives white a free move that strengthens his group. N9, N13, F6 are better moves.]
;W[md];B[mk];W[mg]C[White is now out into your hoped-for territory.]
;B[nj];W[kh];B[ii];W[ki]C[White is content to just run around the center killing territory (doesn't need to claim any, just prevent you from getting any).]
;B[lf];W[mf];B[lg];W[le]C[M12 would have cut off white's L11 stones.]
;B[ke]C[Answering with L15 played right into his hands :(
If you cut white off, then he must live and you get an extra move or two. Losing the territory at L15 is ok if you get the L11 stones and territory as yours.]
;W[lh];B[kf];W[nh];B[ni]C[How about R13 instead of N11?
Try this:
wQ13 bP13 wR13 bQ14 wP12 which is an unhappy result for you.]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[lo]C[This is an excellent point for white. Notice that white is playing moves that you must answer, keeping sente and leaving you with gote.]
;B[mn];W[mo]C[If you were connected at Q13 I would suggest ignoring this. There are bigger moves on the board than the couple of points at O6. As it is, R13 is urgent until your bottom group lives for sure.]
;B[oo]C[This move wastes territory. Try P4 instead. That leaves you with a potential two-eye shape which could be valuable later as well.]
;W[bq];B[fj]C[This does not secure much territory. White can play F7 or H9 and jump right in. Try F6 which limits white and extends your bottom.]
;W[eh]C[White would have been better at F6 too.];B[ei]C[E11 better at F6. E11 pushes white down and is worth a few points. F6 is worth many points!]
;W[di];B[ef]C[What would you do if white played E10? E14 is better at D10, since you played E11 already.]
;W[df];B[dj];W[cj];B[jk];W[in];B[hl];W[gn];B[fm];W[fn];B[en]
;W[ap];B[bo];W[qr]C[Wouldn't it be nice if you'd played R2 first? White is making good use of sente.]
;B[nr];W[mr];B[or];W[ms];B[ns]C[O1 gains no territory and prevents no territory from begin gained. It is a totally wasted move, which can cost dearly at any time in go.]
;W[ih]C[Now white invades the territory you spent several moves at F12 trying to gain. K12 would cut off J12, giving up J10 area.]
;B[hh];W[ig];B[hg];W[ji];B[ij];W[lc]C[Don't answer these kind of moves. If white wants this stone he must play two moves to get it, one to capture and one to fill in. There's a lot more to be had at R13 (sente), R9 (sente), K13, L7, P19, R6, E17...
Wow I only just noticed how good R9 is--try it, you could either cut off Q8 group or R11 group.]
;B[kd];W[rg];B[rf];W[qm];B[qn];W[rn];B[pm]C[Q7 is another wasted move.]
;W[qk];B[km];W[kn];B[ln];W[jn];B[aj];W[ai];B[ak];W[dh];B[ec]
;W[cb];B[qg];W[rh];B[jm];W[im];B[il];W[eo];B[dm]C[How about G7 instead? This is a wasted move.]
;W[gm];B[gl];W[ee];B[ff];W[ed]C[There are still sente moves for you that are worth more than this, which is worth one point. P19 and A5 for example.]
;B[fd];W[nf];B[og];W[kk];B[kl];W[lk];B[ll];W[sf];B[se];W[sg]
;B[rd];W[oa];B[jg];W[jh];B[mj];W[li];B[ao];W[aq];B[pa];W[oh]
;B[oi]C[Q11 is another wasted move. The 'bamboo joint' connection doesn't need any help to stay connected! Try Q9 or L13.]
;W[pk];B[ok]C[This is another wasted move which cannot gain any territory.]
;W[nk];B[oj];W[mh]C[This is a wasted move for white.];B[qj]
;W[rk]C[White appropiately defends, preventing loss of S12 group.]
;B[hm];W[hn];B[op];W[mq]C[A wasted move for white, losing one point of territory.]
