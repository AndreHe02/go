[dr:B]C[I wanted to attack 2 white stones and enlarge black's bottom moyo. Was it the right idea?

This is a good move.

Alternatively, you can also exchange black A for white B first.]
;W[nq]
(;B[op]C[Maybe m3 instead of p4 was better? Now the corner looks overconcentrated and 2 black stones on the left are a bit thin.

M3 is better, if white choose to play R3, you can have a nice wall in exchange.]
;W[jq]
(;B[iq]LB[kq:A]C[Wasn't it better to cut white stones with l3?

Here white should play A, L4 is an overplay.];W[kp]
(;B[jr]C[This look like crude move, when L3 can't work, J4 is the next option to consider.

If black J4, white L3, black can get sente, K2 is yose, small move right now.]
;W[kq];B[ip];W[kn];B[lo]C[Helping move by black.];W[ko];B[kl]
C[L2 is more critical here.

If white M2, black still can play N2...

Black should aim to uproot white and let him run towards the center.]
;W[in];B[fn]LB[fc:A][cf:B]C[Seems like I was too fascenated with attacking white group. Now d2 look much better for black.

Yes, D2 is huge but may not be sente, you can consider approaching the top left corner at A or B.

By the way, L6 group is not attackable...];W[fp];B[gp];W[go]
;B[fo];W[ep];B[gq];W[gn]TR[kl]LB[fm:A]C[Black A is a must, allowing white to play A contradicts with L8.

Black can get living shape by playing H2 later.];B[dr];W[fm]
C[White get perfect influence. Now I feel, that black is behind. What is more urgent: to play on the left side or to attack 2 white stones on the right?]
(;B[ch]C[I really can't find a good mover there...
I didn't played c14, because I was afraided of wite pincer.

This is a good move.];W[cf];B[ck];W[bl];B[bk];W[bg]LB[bh:A]
C[Black A is OK here.

White is helping black to make a living group.];B[ej];W[gj]
;B[fh];W[bi]LB[bh:A][ah:B][ci:C]C[Black can consider playing A, white B then black C.

This way, black got better eye shape.];B[hh];W[mm]TR[kl]LB[ec:A]
[fc:B]C[White should consider playing A.

Black L8 is a light stone, black can choose to sacrifice if he wants to.

Black should consider playing B to approach the corner, instead of trying to attack R11 group.

Idea here is that top side is much worth developing (the points you can see or count...), whereas how much you stand to gain for attacking R11 group is hard to say.]
;B[rj]C[Is it the right direction to attack white stones?

Nothing to do with direction here, choosing to attack this group is strategically incorrect.

In the actual game, white got a good result, because black only gets about 5 points or so in sente...]
;W[qj];B[rk];W[qk];B[rl];W[nk];B[cc]C[F17 better.];W[dc];B[fc]
LB[db:A]C[Here my play isn't very consistent :(
Seems that it was a bad day, when I played c17 stone, because c17-d17 exchange is clearly bad for black. It was better just to play f17?

Yes, much much better.

Now C17/D17 exchange become a bad move.

White can consider A to remove the aji.];W[fd];B[gc];W[gd];B[ic]
;W[ie];B[jh];W[qq];B[pr];W[rn]LB[qo:A]C[Black should play A here.]
(;B[ro];W[pn];B[qo];W[pm]TR[om]LB[db:A][eb:B][cb:C][ec:D][be:E]
C[In the actual game, P7 is hurted, however, you still get C3 which is huge, so it is not too bad still.

Right now, black to play A to live the upper left corner is the biggest move.]
;B[cq];W[re]LB[db:A]C[Black should play A.];B[ke]C[Here, center is NOT that big as it may seem, because white can always reduce by playing O12.]
;W[eb]LB[id:A][he:B]C[Winning move, perhaps white D18 is even better (white got monkey jump next if black tenuki), but the idea here is to kill the corner.

Another point to note is black should exchange A with B early, to remove K17 aji.]
;B[nb];W[jc];B[jb]C[White K16 better.

L17 is crude move (banging your own 2-stone's head is bad most of the times).]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[ld]C[Bad misread by white, ladders at K16 is possible for black.]
(;B[kd]C[You missed a good chance...];W[jd]
(;B[mc]C[Bad move...

O17 is not key stone, but M16 is.

White wouldn't pull out that soon (a surprise to me he did so in the real game), but it is better to keep the aji there.]
;W[le];B[kf];W[lf];B[kg];W[ng];B[lg]TR[lf][le][ld]C[Maybe n13 was more severe?

Idea here is that white can choose to give up the 3 marked stones, by playing N12 if black N13.]

[rb:D]C[Black should play S16 and capture S15 in sente.

Black A, white B, black C and white has to play D to make sure corner is alive.]

Basically, white gain nothing and lose aji around L10 or K9.]
;W[po];B[pp];W[no];B[ph]LB[cm:A][dl:B][bm:C][dm:D]C[Was there any better endgame moves?

This is okay but black A, white B, black C and white D, this is sente for black.

Since white need to reply at P11, Q12 still a good move.];W[oi]

 (I'm around 10 points behind).
Thanks again for the review!
Any general suggestions on how to improve?

Read books on Tesuji, focuse more on the strength and weakness of shape.

Hope you enjoy this review, sorry to keep you waiting cos I am rather busy with work.

No, black is helping white instead (cos white is very happy if black choose this line of play). 

M17 has made the top less worthy, thus F17 is in fact over-concentrated in a way.

Black will have a hard time invading moyo of this size...]))
