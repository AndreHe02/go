C[$ Hi, I'm schEkkEr and will review your game. I'll prepend all my comments with "$".

The most important things:
- You should play more solidly. Your loose opening plays were punished later in the game.
- Don't leave the fight until it's over.
- Don't force the opponent to connect ("Thank You moves").]

C[$ This is too optimistic. Playing this kind of extension usually aims at building a moyo, but there is too much space left at the bottom. See variation to see how easily White could invade and get a base.

I would have preferred k4 (this is the Kobayashi opening).]

(;W[po]
(;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[mp];W[qi];B[qg]C[$ This is a bit pointless. The White position looks firm so there's no point in attacking here. Start attacking something less secure! c11 or c12 allows you to split the left side.]
;W[ce];B[jc]C[$ Another so-so move that cedes the initiative to White, without really making territory. Remember that White can still invade the corner. k16 would have been better at countering the influence from the White top left corner.

As you have already invested at r13, why not invade at r9? It looks worthwhile to try and separate r11 from the white group further below. Another possibility would have been to play on the left.]
;W[dj];B[oi]C[$ The right idea, but not the proper move as you experience now ;)]
;W[ph];B[pg]C[$ The corner territory you try to protect is not there - White can still invade.]
;W[oh];B[pk]C[$ Adding a stone to an already weak group, forcing the opponent to connect...

Better to treat the p11 stone as expendable and play somewhere else. g17, k4, d8, ...]
;W[qk];B[ni];W[nh];B[mi]C[$ Ok, but sooner or later you must play o9 to fix the shape.]
;W[nc];B[nd]C[$ Better play p17 to keep the corner and justify the earlier r13/q13 moves.]
;W[mc];B[md]C[$ p17 would have been perfect here.];W[pb];B[oc]
;W[ob]C[$ White says Thank You to be forced to connect.];B[qc]
C[$ Better take sente and play somewhere else. The White group looks safe.]
;W[qb]C[$ I would have preferred m17 and l18 (more forcing).]
;B[fd]C[$ This is too optimistic. You continue to build several thin and only weakly connected groups. White can easily play h17. I would have either played g17 which gives you a solid base, or m17 to connect to your top left group. Maybe n7.]
;W[ee];B[fe];W[ff];B[gf];W[fg];B[bn]C[$ Yes, around here is a good place to reduce White's left side. Other possibilities are e7 (enlarging your bottom moyo) or invasion at c3.

Your top is left with an open skirt (no stone at f18) and a great invading point for White at h16.]
;W[bo];B[co];W[bm];B[dn];W[an];B[do];W[cp]C[$ White wants everything but gets too thin. He could have kept a solid left side territory with e7 but would have to give up the corner, but I think it would have been playable as there is room on the bottom to invade/reduce.

Sooner or later e4 is necessary.];B[cm];W[bn]C[$ Not necessary for White. I would have preferred c8 and then c2 or d2 or so]
;B[cl]C[$ Good!];W[bl]C[$ How nice from White to invite you to push into his territory. He should have just fixed the corner, though I don't see a especially nice move. d2 looks solid but weird.]
;B[ck];W[cj];B[fk]C[$ Good sequence for Black. White is still vulnerable in the corner. e8 looks a little more solid, though.]
;W[ek];B[el];W[fj];B[ei]C[$ Too aggressive. White can just block at f11. g9!]
;W[ej];B[gk];W[mm]C[$ This move threatens nothing. Good opportunity to play k4!]
;B[on];W[pn]C[$ I think White should have connected out with p7.]
;B[om]C[$ Good idea to separate him but your p7 stones look vulnerable.]
;W[gp];B[fp];W[ko];B[ip]C[$ Often it's better to concede a little and keep the rest safe. Here I would have preferred l3 - White has no good follow up.]
;W[iq];B[jq]C[$ Good - White is weak here so you can fight hard.]
;W[jp];B[hq];W[ir]C[$ Not good - j5 and then k7 or so might be enough to live.]
;B[jr];W[hp];B[io]C[$ Good fight from you.];W[ol];B[nl]C[$ I think cutting at q8 was important here. He would probably have lost either the q6 group (very big) or the p8 stones (lets you connect).]
;W[ok];B[pj];W[nk];B[nm]C[$ q8 was still possible here. The ladders don't work, if I see this correctly. Additionally your o7 group gets weaker... the empty triangle is a good indicator.]
;W[pl];B[lk]C[$ This helps neither one of the surrounding groups. Separate him with n8!]
;W[mk];B[ml];W[lj]C[$ Ouch...];B[lm];W[mj];B[gj]C[$ Why leave in the middle of a fight? White m12 kills your n11 stones. If you play m12 yourself he would need to defend his o12 group, and you are back in sente.]
;W[gi]C[$ Too loose -> f11!];B[fh];W[gh];B[gg];W[ii]C[$ White has got a good result.

Look at your groups. You have some territory on the bottom, but the White groups there still have some potential. Your entire top looks weak, the o11 group is almost dead.

This is the result of too loose opening plays.];B[ef]C[$ The following sequence doesn't even give you a living group (White just fails to punish it), but lets White push into your weak top. You should have fixed some of your weaknesses instead. e18 maybe?]

;B[bf];W[cg]TR[bc];B[bb];W[db];B[ac];W[ba];B[af];W[gb]C[$ He doesn't see that b16 kills - Lucky you!]
;B[fc]C[$ This is of no use. You just force him to connect.]
;W[fb];B[hb]C[$ Now he rips apart the top. If there was a single losing move, it was this one. h16 or h17 might have saved something.]
;W[gc];B[ge]C[$ h16 was still better here.];W[hd]C[$ Now you see why it was bad to play so loose here in the opening.]
;B[ie];W[id];B[jd];W[je];B[jf];W[ke];B[ld];W[lf];B[mh];W[ea]
;B[hc]C[$ Not necessary - your top group is almost dead anyway; after n13 you might be able to save the g14 stones.]
;W[gd];B[ik]C[$ Don't leave the fight! n13 to threaten to cut off his l15 group!]
;W[ki];B[jh]C[$ White says Thank You for inviting him to connect his groups.]
;W[ji];B[kj]C[$ Why - the groups above are threatened? Also this invites White to take away one liberty from the n12 group which might be valuable later.]
;W[li];B[kk];W[mg];B[hh];W[hi];B[ih]C[$ No way you can make this live. Check the leftover space - this is dead.

From here on the game looks more like a melee so I guess I can't expect every move to be perfectly thought through...]
