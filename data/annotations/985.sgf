C[Before i start the review, i'd like to encourage you to play more often with humans

Especially in the endgame, white played so badly you don't realise many of your moves are errors]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[pd]C[Since I play a lot of games where I get a handicap, I am most
familiar with starting on the 4-4 point.

jean: that's perfectly correct ; but you should also try out different corner openings, to get used to them]
;B[nq];W[pn]
(;B[kp]C[This is the most common exchange I expect from this approach
move.  Would 7 be better one stone to the left?

yes. this stone should be on K4 or K3
also see variation];W[oq]C[only answer is o4 (see variation)]

(;B[no]C[black position on the right-down side is really too thin with so many stones]
;W[fc];B[df]C[This is my standard response to an approach move.

jean : try to pincer in some of your games];W[jc]C[here is the answer to your first quastion
now if black e17 , see var]
(;B[qf];W[qh]C[I was hoping to repeat the pattern of the lower right corner

jean : white can't allow you to repeat it.  if black settles on the right side, white lower-right corner becomes vulnerable]

(;B[of]C[standard answer to this pincer is invading at the 3-3 point (see variation)]

(;W[qd]C[????
strange move ; see var];B[nc]C[looks really dubious  why not p12 with the same idea as before (play lightly here)]
;W[nd]C[Should I have played 17 at 18 instead?

jean : surely, but i guess p12 first is better]
(;B[pc];W[qc];B[qb];W[rb];B[ob]MA[pb]C[This was intended to defend the cutting point and make some eye
shape.  Is this better than connecting at X?

jean: surely, but why did you accept to get onfined to the side and expose your two stones on the right to attack]
;W[re];B[lc];W[rg];B[mf];W[ld]
(;B[kb]C[Was my upper right group alive before this, or is 29 necessary?

jean: it was already alive, or could at least escape in the center]
;W[jb];B[md];W[ne];B[me];W[cn];B[fp]C[Would a pincer have been better here?  Look at the game in retrospect
it seems like a better idea.

jean: yes ; why not a long distance pincer at c10];W[bp];B[cq]
;W[ck];B[ci];W[kd];B[nf];W[kf];B[od]C[Was this too small of a move?

of course. capturing two unnecessary stones at this stage is really very small]
;W[fe]C[much bigger then previous move

other big points are on the bottom side];B[dc]C[this move only defends some territory and doesn't threaten anything

still look at B3 ou O2 which are much bigger];W[bq];B[cr]C[why not hane at b2 ????]
;W[lh]C[unncessary
center is a huge dame for me
rather play something like o2 (balck) or p2 (white)];B[pj]MA[qk]
C[Is this a good point to invade and/or reduce the right side?
I considered X but though that I was more likely to get killed.

jean : if you want to invade,  i'd bet R8 is the better spot to aim at]
;W[rj];B[ql];W[om];B[oh];W[mm];B[nj];W[lj];B[rn];W[rp]C[strange thing happened here
white let black connect peacefully and eat just about everything on the left

the cut at Q9 is annoying, though (cause black can't enter any further in the corner)
R10 or some other move will have to be played];B[iq]C[Should I have added any more stones to the right side at this
point?  Is 59 the best way to prevent an invasion here?

jean : the best point is always hard to guess. 59 is good i think
of course, this doesn't preserve the cut on the right side ... but losing the two R8 and S7
stones is smaller than having the bottom side devastated];W[eb]
;B[db];W[ej];B[eh];W[el];B[in];W[fi];B[fh];W[km];B[il];W[gl]
;B[ij]C[white could be able to cut later on

simply reducing the center from the left side would be just as good and less risky]
;W[fn]C[serves nothing];B[go];W[ih]C[I thought that running these stones up the middle was a good
idea to reduce white's central territory.];B[gg];W[hf];B[kk]
C[this looks like a dame];W[lk];B[hi]C[same remark applies
do you get any point or keep white from getting some ?];W[sl]
;B[rl];W[pk]
(;B[pl]C[black is cut anyway
he should look for compensations (see var)];W[ok];B[qk];W[qj]
;B[oj]C[I didn't manage to save those stones on the right.  Was there
a better way to do this?];W[ol]C[unnecessary]
(;B[or]C[why not O2, which isn't smaller and is sente ?];W[pr]

(;B[os]C[first, atari at o4, then simply connect a o2 (see var)]
;W[ps];B[mr];W[bj];B[bi];W[sk]C[losing one point for white
black already dead here];B[op];W[pq];B[po];W[qo];B[oo]MA[ln]
C[This now looks like a small exchange to lose Sente over.  I think
I should have played elsewhere.  Perhaps at X

jean: k19 is big and sente];W[hk];B[ik];W[hh];B[gi]C[serves nothing, except giving white some sente moves in the region
k19  still sente];W[if]C[white is afraid of some phantom menace :)]
;B[gf];W[ge];B[ji];W[kh];B[jh];W[jg];B[ki];W[li];B[kl];W[ll]
;B[hm]C[k7 surely bigger if you intend to play in this region]
;W[gj];B[hj]C[nearly dame];W[eo];B[gm];W[fm];B[ep];W[pe];B[pf]
C[I was playing to fast and didn't think to capture the two white
stones here.  This does save the black stone to the right of
125, however.
jean: of course saving the stone is bigger];W[oe];B[oc];W[ka]
;B[la];W[nh];B[ph];W[ja];B[lb]C[black's group is alive without this move, simply plying s19 (sente)]
;W[pb];B[pa]C[white gave one prsionner ; thanks];W[do];B[ln]
;W[lm];B[mn];W[nk];B[kn];W[jm];B[im];W[jn];B[jo];W[br];B[cp]
;W[co];B[dj];W[dk];B[cj];W[bk];B[ei];W[fj];B[ec];W[fb];B[ee]
;W[hd];B[ff];W[kj]C[answering this move loses the initiative again
black doesn't have any point left in the center anyway];B[jj]
;W[jl];B[jk];W[gn];B[ho];W[ai];B[ah];W[aj];B[bh]C[much bigger than losing the sente before]
;W[gh];B[rf];W[sf]C[I tried to think of a way to cut off and kill the white stones
in the upper right corner, but I couldn't come up with any way
to do it
jean: there is no way];B[qg];W[ri];B[qe];W[rc];B[ng];W[mh];B[on]
;W[pm]C[once more a free point offered by white];B[hg];W[ig]
;B[le];W[ke];B[ea];W[fa];B[da]C[I didn't see any other Sente moves  that were worth more than
this.
jean: this move would have been sente for white, thus was "urgent"]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[qi];B[bs];W[mj];B[nm];W[nl];B[nn];W[ra];B[qa]
;W[ar];B[cs]C[this is not even a dame ; only a forced connection
there are points left on the board];W[ni];B[lg];W[kg];B[fd]
;W[gd];B[ed];W[gc]C[thank you Mr. white];B[as]C[dame];W[bo]
C[white shouldn't answer];B[hl];W[gk];B[hn];W[lf];B[mg];W[qn]
C[Did white really need to do this?  I hadn't considered cutting
here until white connected.

jean: white loses one more point here. black's stones are dead, whichever way we look at them]
;B[fo];W[kc];B[ii];W[ns];B[nr];W[tt];B[tt]C[Black wins by 4 points with no Komi.

Lots of blunders in the yose made by both players])
(;B[op];W[pq];B[nr]C[now q1 is still sente for black, while p1 is gote for white]
))
(;B[nr];W[or];B[os];W[ps];B[ns];W[qr]C[doesn't change much to the result, but is sente, hence much better]

the two stones on the left aren't already in great danger]))
(;W[nd]C[i prefer this one];B[oh];W[qe];B[rf];W[qj]C[it's not clear whether this result is better for black than a direct invasion at 3-3]

(;B[ec];W[fd]C[now white stone on k17 is ideally placed from f16-17, so black e17 is a bad move]
