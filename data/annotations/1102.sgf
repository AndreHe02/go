AB[pd][pp][dd]C[White wins with 27 points. But duringthe whole game I thought that I would
win. I cannot see my severest mistakes...

bridges: Okay... Let's talk handicap strategy for a minute first. You start with hoshi (4-4) points, which are very center-oriented. Because of this, you have to play an influence-oriented game. This of course is not necessarily easy. You want to make sure you don't let white box you into the sides or corners, and when you have the opportunity to do so, attack white strongly. You can then secure territory while attacking. If you try to just claim territory from your 4-4 points, white will most likely win.   So, the goal is to keep white seperated and weak, and build influence so that you can take profit later while attacking. If you play too passively, white will take advantage and win.]
;W[ep]C[bridges: white starts off with a 5-4 point, hoping to get influence to start to offset some of black's.]
;B[co]LB[cp:A][cq:B][jd:C][pj:D]C[bridges: A and B are the normal points to approach a 5-4 point. At this point, however, approaching the 5-4 point is not necessarily favorable, because it lets white build influence. Playing a san-ren-sei at C or D are possible moves here.]
;W[cq];B[dj]LB[cm:A][dl:B][dk:C]C[This should make territory. Is it a good move?

bridges: this is a bit far from the stone at C5. White can aim to invade at around A later. In a handicap game, it's dangerous to get too caught up thinking about territory. In particular, the structure on the left is much too loose to be thought of as territory, particulaly with the solid white shape at the bottom. I would have played around B or maybe C.]
;W[fc]
(;B[fd]LB[df:A][jc:B][jd:C]C[Playing besides to 4 seemed to strong to me. OK?

bridges: F16 leads to sequences that tend to give black a good bit of profit on the left, while giving white a strong, secure shape at the top. This is something to remember about attachments - they generally make the stone you're attaching to stronger. While not necessarily bad, it does let white settle himself very easily into a strong shape that is hard to attack. Playing near A is one other possibility, as is a pincer like B or C.]
;W[gd];B[fe];W[ec];B[dc]C[I thought that 10 makes good shape.

bridges: Yes, this is the correct move here.];W[jc];B[nd]C[bridges: Not a bad move, though playing O17 is better, The point at Q10 is still *very* large. Black is better off playing a large-scale move like Q10 than a move like this.]
;W[cl]C[bridges: This happened because C5 is close to a strong white group, and D10 was too far away. Still, white doesn't exactly have a base here, and if you can get a thick position out of this, that won't be bad.]
;B[dl]C[14 seemed appropriate to defend the
moyo. I saw danger from the two white
stone below.

bridges: Defend the moyo? White will almost certainly live here, and have carved a good section out of black's territory. However, if black builds a thick outer wall, he can turn that into profit in the middle, and it will help him in fighting that might result from trying to surround the right and bottom. THis is not a bad move.]
;W[dm];B[ck]C[Correct decision?

bridges: It's not bad, but you've essentially abandoned the C5 stone now.]
;W[dn]C[bridges: Be aware that black can capture the C8 stone in the sequence shown, though that is not the biggest point on the board right now.]

(;B[gq]C[bridges: Too close to a reasonably strong white position. Q10 or thereabouts cries to be played. On this side of the board, holding back to K3 or thereabouts is better. This ignores the proverb "don't play to close to thickness"]
;W[cn]C[bridges: white seemed nervoud about his cut at C7. It was some weakness that he had to be concerned about. Now, white is quite strong at the bottom, and will be aiming to pincer the G3 stone and use that strength. THis is a bad move by white, however, and black should take advantage of this with something like K4.]
;B[jp]C[bridges: Good! A very fine move.];W[bl];B[el]C[bridges: ANother fine point. Notice that black is open at B9 (this is sometimes referred to as an "open skirt"), and so white can make significant reduction there later with a one point jump. The left side isn't territory as a result, but black is doing pretty well at this point.]
;W[qf];B[nc]C[Too defensive?

bridges: A disastrous move. This is *much* too defensive. This is an ideal place to pincer the white stone at around R11. A pincer that attacks and is also a good extension is too good to be missed. This territory-oriented play in the upper left is classic bad play in handicap games, and just what white hopes for. Now white can make a base and settle himself on the right side easily. This is much too passive play.]
;W[qj];B[ql]C[bridges: A good point to take. White will be looking to invade the bottom soon either around O3 or R3.]
;W[dg]C[bridges: with B9 open, this is perhaps playable, especially since black has to worry about white pushing through at E16 and cutting at D15.]

(;B[eb]C[I don´t remember the sense.  Is a better?

bridges : Black must do something about the D13 stone, but white should probably resond to this. As long as you don;t back up at D18 afterwards, this isn't too bad. Still, it gives me an uneasy feeling somehow.]
;W[fb];B[fg]C[This position seems strong to me.

bridges: Good sense to ignore the cut at D18. This is a fine attack on the white stone. Even if it lives or escapes, the white position at the top is weaker, as is the white position on the other side of the board. In addition, black has good shape around D10, so those stones aren't in danger of attack either.]
;W[eh]
(;B[fm]C[At the moment a prefer c. OK?

bridges: I don't understand the point of this move. The black stones on the left side that you're extending from have nice shape, and aren't really a concern, which the white stones around D6 are strong as well. A play in this part of the board seems small right now.]
;W[ce]C[bridges: and now white expands his base while carving out a large chuck from the black territory.]
;B[de];W[fi];B[hg];W[hi]C[Did I looose the game because of the
last two moves?

bridges: the move at F7 was the really large mistake.];B[cb]
C[bridges: this cut is worth protecting only if you plan to attack the white stones at the top at around H17.]
;W[cf];B[bk]C[bridges: This move is relatively small now that white has destroyed the left side, unless you plan on attacking the H11 stones. Just connecting at G5 is a fine point making a very large framework at the bottom.]
;W[nq]LB[qh:A][lq:B][pq:C]C[bridges: white has left his stones at the top left somewhat weak. Black should be thinking about the correct way to attack them. Since white is looking to create another weak group here, black should think about either driving them both into the center in a way that he could attack both at once, or capping them and building thickness to attack them or invade at A. However, moves at B and C are much better, and I prefer B.]

(;B[ol]C[Wrong direction? Would a have
been better?

bridges: This is so-so. It has a small effect on the stone at the bottom, but because it threatens to invade at R12, it's not really bad.]
;W[pr];B[qp]LB[qq:A]C[bridges: MUCH to passive. This lets white make eyes on the edge MUCH too easily. Playing at A is better.]
;W[rq];B[lq]C[The last two black moves seemed
perfect to me.

bridges: No. This move is okay, but needed to be played earlier. White lives easily on the side since he could play S3 and take the corner. White tried to give you  a weak group while he already had a floating group on the board. You should jump at that chance. Black is playing a game much too centered on territory. When you are taking a handicap, you must build influence and use it to attack.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[no]
(;B[mr]C[Is Black 50 too defensive?

bridges: Yes. One possible combination for black to keep in mind here is the peep at p4 followed by a splitting tesuji at the bottom, as shown... However, because black is small and somewhat weak on the right, it's not clear that that works here.

ON a larger scale, notice that white has split black into at least four and perhaps five seperate parts. This is bad for black.]
;W[mo];B[on]C[That seemed perfect to me: I madeterritory, attacked and defended.

bridges: except there isn't much to attack here because white took the corner so easily, and black is small. Black seems to be thinking on a very small scale in this game, taking small local territories while white works over the scale of the entire board. This move isn't bad if black now intends to launch the splitting attack I mentioned earlier.]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[oq]C[bridges: white covers up he weakness in the corner, and is now almost certainly alive.]
;B[oj]C[Wrong direction?

bridges: Yes and no. It's more oriented toward the whole board than your previous moves, and so I'm a little reluctant to criticize it. It puts some pressure on the white stones on the right side, but invading directly at R12 is something else to consider instead.]
;W[ph]C[bridges: because now white covers the invasion point easily, and was never in any real danger.]
;B[re]C[Too weak?

bridges: a purely territorial move, and essentially endgame, though it would be okay if it ended in sente or had a larger aim to it, like building to attack another group. This is not a bad move, however.]
;W[fr]C[bridges: hmm, this seems suspicious on white's part.  This is an endgame move that threatens to undercut your base, but because you have thickness and no other really weak groups, I'd be tempted to ignore this and dive in at S13. This gives white a weak group on the right side of the board that you can take a lot of profit from attacking.]
;B[go]C[bridges: Keeping this connection isn't bad, but it only has one aim.]
;W[rk];B[cd]C[bridges: Okay if you're aiming at attacking these white stones, but play S13 and make white weak there, too.]
;W[rf];B[qe];W[lc];B[qc]C[bridges: dreadfully passive];W[le]
;B[ge]C[Wrong defense?

bridges: Defense?

Let's step back again: Look at the board. black has a small territory in the upper left, a medium territory in the upper right, and a small territory on the right side. White has a medium sized territory in the lower left, a small territory in the lower right, a small-to-medium sized territory at the top, and a small territory on the right side. White is almost certainly ahead in territory. If white can save the F11 stones and keep black from making a lot in the middle, he will certainly win. This happened because:
1.  black allowed himself to be seperated into pieces, which white could easily reduce
2. black seemed to rarely be looking for the opportunity to attack white, and played much too passively.

Black can only hope to attack the F11 stones now and kill there or find some other way to make profit. Black having to rely on killing white in a handicap game  is a very sad thing.]
;W[hd];B[he];W[nh]C[bridges: and now white gets into the middle from over there, and white is going to be very hard to kill. The game is already over. This happened because black played a very passive, territory oriented game, when a handicap opening is oriented toward a influence-style of play. In terms of moves that we very bad, O17, R4, and F7 all leap to mind as catastrophic.
IN general, black needs to think more about large-scale play in handicap games. A territorial style of play may be fine in other situations, but when starting with hoshi(4-4) points in a low-to-medium handicap game, it almost certainly leads to disaster.]
;B[nf];W[mb]C[bridges: So white just commences playing a comfortable endgame, knowing that he's already ahead.]
;B[nb];W[gr];B[hr];W[so];B[sn];W[qq];B[qo];W[mg];B[sm]C[bridges: What is the purpose of this move?]
;W[ij];B[pf]C[White was sente the last moves, so I
wanted to sttle a new fight.

bridges: BUt there's not really much to fight about now. Except for the F11 stones, everything is pretty much alive.]
;W[mf];B[ne];W[qg];B[oh];W[og];B[oi]C[I was very proud of building the wall.

bridges: Walls are useful when they face something unsettled. THis wall does sort of face the "weak" F11 stones, but that's not that big a deal to white, because he has several places to try and connect them.]

(;B[ir]C[I had a good feeling, but when I see the
game afterwards white has more
territory. Perhaps a move to a would be
good... But I had to defend. Now I
think at this stage the game was lost.

bridges: However, this has been the case for *many* moves, because of black's passive play early on.]
