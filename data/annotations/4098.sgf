;B[pd]C[midorikawa: 
hello];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[ci];B[ep];W[gp]C[I don't know how toplay 
with thisprincer. Is myapproach not right ?vlkplk: Right question at right 
time. To answer simply, You must think about it always in advance, before 
Youplay such move.This pincer, as it is, is not a bad move. Important is the 
continuation. Since the areas scetched on the board now mean, that 
blackwants to take right side and white left, roughly speaking, keeping this 
in mind, right continuation for blackwould be something like BJ4 or the 
like. With sanren sei opening,black is going for strength, while white 
isgoing for territory. This too basic ideas is as well good to keepin mind 
during opening stage of the game.]
(;B[en];W[cn];B[jp];W[ho];B[jn]C[vlkplk: 
So in actual game, black jumped anyway. But this time 1)there are heavy 
burden stones at E4 and E6 without base and difficult to manage later, 
2)the jumping stones areone line closer to right side, thus aiming at less 
territory 3)whites left side is stronger.];W[hm]C[vlkplk: Now, its dilemma 
for black. Still it is time to give up (temporarily) stones atE4 and E6 
and wait for chance to use them later. When running to the center, dont stay 
behind the oponnent!];B[el];W[cl];B[cq]C[Should I play here orI should keep 
jumpingout?vlkplk: Generally, this kind of jumping is not good, I think. 
1)just helps white to fortify his left side, 2)it makes heavy group, with 
little eye-makingpotential and so it becomes easy target forattack. So I 
think itwas good from You to go to the corner and seek some room for 
life.];W[bq];B[dq];W[br]
(;B[cr]C[vlkplk: This was too slow move and didnt 
make eye for sure. Whitenext took the key point, which had had to be played 
by black actually.];W[fq];B[er];W[fr];B[hq]
(;W[fp]
(;B[dn]C[vlkplk: Instead 
of this, Bd4 protects the cut at once and in senteh. And black played it 
anyway later...];W[ip];B[iq];W[fo];B[dp];W[co]C[vlkplk: It seems likegood 
idea to push white to get senteh, but actualy, the profit was 0. If the 
purpose was just to connect, so black could simply play E5 instead of D6 
andD4. This can be called aji keshi. See variation for how it is good 
sometimes not to help opponent to solidifyhis forces.]
(;B[gn]C[vlkplk: I 
would prefer to push on whites group along the left side. Already white is 
formed well there, so bypushing there, black doesnt lose a much. Onthe other 
hand, pushing against whites central group helps him. And even after this, 
blacks group is still not alive. Maybe, blacksmove at G6 should have come 
more earlier.];W[hn];B[gl];W[gm];B[fm];W[jm]C[vlkplk: On the contrary, white 
gets chance to push black down to his own a would-be territory. Black group 
around D6 is not alive yet and consequently potential target for 
atack.]
(;B[lq]C[vlkplk: This replay is, what white was hoping for. It is 
better to give up little, while getting more. Pls see 
variation.];W[kn]
(;B[ko]C[vlkplk: This move helps white to connect his 
cutting point J7.I would prefer simplyto connect at 
K5.];W[in];B[jo];W[ln];B[mo];W[ll];B[il]C[This is a bad 
move];W[hl]
(;B[gk];W[hk]
(;B[jl]C[vlkplk: If previous nozoki was bad, this 
ismuch worse. Once you play a nozoki and oponent answers it, you must not 
continue, but just play somwhere else, waiting for the chance to use such 
move later.];W[jk]
(;B[jd]C[How about this move?should I approachcorner or 
invade orbuild my moyovlkplk: First thing to say-this was one of the biggest 
point on the board for long timeand you could play there even before. Second 
thing-timing. Now itis not as good move, since D6 group is veryweak. Always 
there isrule to secure yours weak groups first of anything else. (And I 
add, as every rule, this one has the exception, which is the case when you 
are willing tosacrifice such weak group, which usualy is better than to 
protectit stubbornly)So I think its good move, if You dont mind to lose D6 
group. If you can get some 40points elsewhere, you may well abandon this 
group.];W[hc];B[ic];W[hd];B[jf];W[hf];B[qc];W[kc];B[jc];W[nc]

;B[lb];W[od];B[ma]C[Maybe 
I should go O14instead of take thecapture. Pleasecommentvlkplk: Probably 
yes,but question is, whether O14 or some similar move can stop white from 
connection to hiscentral group. Anyway, its good idea to cutwhite from 
center andlet him live small. But this could be done before using some 
moresimple way as in variation.Its just my feeling. In actual game, black 
actualy went good by fighting that white 
group...];W[nf];B[pf];W[of];B[pg]C[vlkplk: Now black is getting profit from 
chasing whites group...];W[nh]
(;B[nj]C[vlkplk: When pressingoponnents group, 
its always better to play more tight moves. In this case its almost sure, 
that white will not die. Either he will connect to his centralgroup or will 
make eye in the corner and center. So black must protect his territory while 
chasing white. I dont like this move (black O10) for its looseness. Pls 
see var.];W[li];B[mg]C[I tried to cut offWhite.  Is it ok?vlkplk: I think it 
was interesting move!];W[oh];B[mh]C[vlkplk: I think its was bad to let white 
descend to right side and thus to split black.Better to let him connect and 
not to try tokill him.];W[ph]
(;B[qi]C[vlkplk: Now, the weakpart of blacks 
forcesis the right corner group. Not so much worry for the side-there is 
plenty space. But this blacks move weakenes blacks own corner 
badly.];W[qh]
(;B[rg]C[vlkplk: I feel that R15 is vital point for blacks 
corner group...Better to play 
there.];W[rh];B[ri];W[sh];B[rf];W[oj];B[ok];W[oi];B[mi]C[vlkplk: Now it 
doesntlook good for black. Its impossible to protect that two cuts at the 
same time. And blacks corner group is still not living and seems to have 
less liberties than whites. Problematic was already thatblacks move played 
before...];W[pk];B[qk];W[pl];B[ql];W[pm]
