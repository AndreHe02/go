C[hello, i am vineva. i play the black one. it is my first time ask for a review. Thank you for your kind help.

i am 9k in LGS
and the white player is 8k


catch22: Hi, I am the reviewer for your game. I have tried to answer all your questions, and also commented on other moves, both by Black and White. I hope you find it useful.

When I show variations this is mostly to illustrate an idea. I still have much to learn myself (currently I'm 4k at IGS) so I cannot show perfect play, much as I would like to! :-)]

(;B[ff]C[V: is it better to play at F15?

catch22:They are different types of moves. Which is best may just be a matter of preference and/or style. F15 is a contact play that  tends to give both sides more settled positions, with fewer weaknesses to be exploited in  the future.

The first variation shows one possible continuation of a play at F15. It gives both players influence and the start of potentially large territories. If it's part of a consistent overall strategy, and it suits your style of play, then I think it is okay to play F15.

The second variation shows a common joseki, which is a smaller scale way of playing.]

[pk:a]C[V: is F18 worth to play now?

catch22: No, I don't think so. It is too much focussed on destroying territory. It does not threaten the safety of the White stones, which are quite strong. Furthermore it does not help Black to territory. White can still easily establish a presence at the top. 

There are bigger moves elsewhere on the board. For instance a move at Q9. This consideres the whole board and works well with all Black's stones.

Another way of looking at it as follows. Although the moves were played in a different order, the result in the top left corner is the same as that of the following joseki: B E16, W E17, B F17, W D17, B D14. This is a light way of playing for Black. He quickly establishes a presence, but the important thing is that he has sente to play elsewhere, and should do so. The three Black stones in the top left can look after themselves.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[np];W[qj]TR[pm]C[catch22: This extension by White is too close to his three other stones to be efficient. White should have extended to R11 instead. If, on the other hand, the marked White stone had been at Q6 instead of Q7, then extending to R10 would have been the right distance.]
;B[qg];W[kd]C[V: which side should black play the next move?

catch22: Approaching from the right works out fairly poorly for Black (see variation). 

Approaching from the left, e.g. at J16 as in the game, therefore seems better. Still, this move is too close to the other Black stones to be efficient.

The fact that Black does not have a good reply, suggests that Black's previous move was probably wrong. Maybe it should have been at L16 instead?]

(;W[of]C[catch22: This move gives White bad shape. It should be at O14 instead (see variation).]

(;B[fq]C[catch22: I have created two variations to show why White's last move gives White bad shape.]

;W[ho];B[on]
(;W[jf]C[catch22: White should probably reply to Black's  peep instead (see both variations), because letting Black cut is too good for Black (see variation for next move).]

(;B[ek]C[catch22: Black should probably first play Q6 (see variation).]
;W[hm];B[nb];W[hd]C[V: how should black response to this white move?

catch22: It is difficult for me to be certain, as there are many variations, but I think your response is fine.]
;B[he];W[ie];B[ic]C[V: please give advice. i think black is not good when play this part

catch22: I don't think you got a bad result at all. See my later comments for an explanation.]
;W[hf];B[ge]C[catch22: I don't think this is bad for Black. The stones were not strong to start with, as there was still the cut at F16 to worry about. This cut is now protected, the group is safe, and even made a few points of territory. These stones were never going to surround much territory, so Black could not ask for much more.

It is true that White got influence in the center in return. But Black still has various ways to get into the center, so this should not worry Black too much. Nevertheless, reducing White's potential territory in the center should now be Black's first priority.]
;W[oc];B[ob];W[pn];B[om]LB[mm:a][nm:b][nl:c]TR[on]C[catch22: This is not a good move. These two stones are now heavy and short of liberties. (Unsurprisingly, they end up being captured later in the game). 

If you want to progress into the center, and limit White's ability to do so, you should consider lighter moves such as N7, O7 and O8. The marked stone was only a forcing move, and should be treated as such. It can be sacrificed.]
;W[oj]
(;B[kb]TR[ob][nb]C[catch22: This move is not as big as it seems. It only increases Black territory. It does not reduce White's territory by much, as the marked Black stones already do so. Furthermore, White can safely ignore this move. Instead, Black should probably move into the center (see variation).]

(;B[hr]C[V: i think black shouldn't play at this point right? but where should black play at?

catch22: Black should simply play at J2 (see variation). This move is big, because it is double sente for both sides. By playing here, either side can get profit while retaining sente.]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[gr];B[cg]C[catch22: This is a wrong move. Unless you have planned a follow up, you should not play this move. You are helping White to re-inforce his position, and you are giving him a point (your stone), while doing so. You also lose a potential ko threat.]
;W[dg];B[ca];W[da];B[db];W[cb];B[ea];W[ba]
(;B[bb]C[catch22: Because Black does not have any real big ko-threats (e.g. a threat to kill a group), he should simply connect (see variation). There is no need for the ko. Black can make enough profit without it.]
;W[da];B[lc]LB[bj:a][bn:b]TR[cg]C[V: black find a wrong ko-threat?

catch22: Yes, this move does not have a big follow-up. The follow up is worth only about two points. White is right to ignore it. Better threats would be B10, which threatens to rescue the marked stone, or B6, which threatens another monkey jump. However, these ko threats are still relatively small, and White should probably still ignore them.]

;W[bg];B[in];W[im];B[hn]C[catch22: A very small move. You are not making any territory, and not destroying any of White's territory either.]
;W[hk]C[catch22: In fact, you "forced" White to protect his cutting point (at L8) in a way that eats into your potential territory.]

;B[gi];W[ii];B[ih];W[jk];B[gm]LB[sj:a][ap:b][ce:c][ro:d]C[catch22: Moves like this are small. It does not threaten White and only slowly builds territory for Black. White should therefore ignore it. Black should play sente moves instead, to gain profit while retaining the initiative.

For instance, T10, which is big because it prevents White from playing T11 in sente. White will also find it difficult to ignore A4, C15 or S5.]
;W[fn];B[em];W[jc];B[jb];W[hc];B[ib];W[hb];B[fa];W[fd]
(;B[gd]TR[ed]C[catch22: Letting White capture the marked stone is very big, as it stops Black from entering White's territory at the top left. Black should therefore resist (see variation).]

;W[md];B[ke];W[lf];B[jd];W[kf];B[kc]C[catch22: Simply playing at K15 is 1.5 points better for Black. That way Black does not play in his own territory (1 point). Furthermore, White can still destroy Black's point at L16 by playing at K15 (half a point, because it is gote).]
;W[mc];B[mb];W[op];B[oq];W[rq];B[sp];W[no]TR[qp][qo][rp][sp]
C[V: is there any move can help black to save P6 & P7?

catch22: No, not without losing more points than doing so is worth because White will otherwise enter Black's territory on the side, or capture the four marked stones.]
;B[mo];W[nn];B[pp]C[catch22: As it was sente for White to play here, he should have done so before playing O6. If Black would rescue his two stones, White would capture four Black stones and be better off in the trade.]
;W[oo];B[nq];W[si];B[sh]
(;W[sj]C[catch22: In this case, White could consider starting a ko by cutting at S12. The reason is that it is a picnic ko for White. He can gain a lot, but has not much to lose. There is the drawback that Black has local threats to fight the ko, but these have to be used with care as Black is raising the stakes of the ko while using these. See variation.]

TR[hb][hc][hd]C[catch22: Black should have played this move himself, before playing H19. Although you have to be careful not to lose the big chain of black stones, or let them end up in seki, the chain still had enough outside liberties to capture the three White marked stones before they could do any harm. 

It is interesting to note, by the way, that White could have gained a point by extending to H19 himself. Although Black could still capture these stones, he would have needed two more stones to do so.]
;B[tt]C[catch22: Black passed, but he shouldn't have. He could still reduce White's total by a point by playing at H4.]
