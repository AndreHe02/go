;W[qj];B[qm];W[cj]LB[qh:A]C[note that there is a serious weakness at 'a'.
i would play there immediately.];B[cm];W[cf];B[df]C[bad, you should tobi again, this way you make his stones strong]

of removing his weakness.];W[jc];B[lc]LB[qh:A]C[you agree this is not a brilliant extension? :)
i would prefer 'a' and see how things devellope, after you can
wait for a chance to play a more natural move here.];W[je];B[jp]C[ok :)]

'a', 'b' and 'c'...];W[fb]

the move at 'a' would be better.];W[kl];B[jm];W[ln];B[ko];W[hm];B[jl];W

it would have been a close game.

i think you could improve your skill by attacking more confidently])
