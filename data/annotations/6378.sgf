C[Hello, I write in what I think several times in the game and thanks and stuff like that comes in the end.

Just so you know what I would like the most out of this review from the wonderful person that does it
is to find out moves so I can get center influence

[SC\] Hello! This is my first review: I hope it is of some use to you.

Below is a site which you should find useful (free signup).  It contains problems of many type (eg life and death, endgame) which you should benefit from.

www.goproblems.com];B[pp];W[qd];B[dp];W[dd];B[jn]LB[dn:A]C[[SC\] This is a strange move from black.  Here he is aiming to gain influence whilst taking the bottom.

The best way to deal with this move would be playing at A, which reduces some of blacks influence.

See variation for the high approach.]
(;W[cn];B[dn]TR[jn]C[Here I get an approach I'm not used, I've read about how to deal with it but there I don't know if I did it right

[SC\] This move works very well with the marked stone.  White will now find it hard to contest blacks influence at the bottom.]
;W[dm]C[[SC\] Correct move, despite the advantage black gains.]

(;B[do]
(;W[dj]LB[cl:A]C[Playing at A would be a more solid move  - white will not need to worry about the cut. However D10 is also good as it aims to make a moyo quickly.

See variations];B[fm];W[oc]LB[kc:A]C[[SC\] Indeed, this is the right time to develop the top.  (Personally I would play A, but making a corner enclosure is also good).]
;B[hj]C[[SC\] Poor move in my opinion.  Doesn't work efficiently enough with his other stones.]

(;W[qn]LB[pn:A]C[[SC\] Again, playing at A is the optimal move.    As a general rule, playing on the 4th line avoids being confined to the sides, and allows white to contest the center.]
;B[pn]C[[SC\] Black is happy to push white into a low position again.]
;W[pm];B[po];W[pj];B[om]TR[jn]C[[SC\] The marked stone is working very efficiently now.]
;W[pl];B[ol]LB[ic:C][fd:B][id:D][df:A]C[[SC\] White's stones are strong enough here to leave them - developing the top is more urgent.]

(;W[ok];B[nk]LB[nj:A]C[See variations.]
(;W[qo];B[oj]C[Black reduces whites territory, while increasing his own.]
;W[pk];B[qp];W[oi];B[nj]LB[ic:C][fd:B][id:D][df:A]C[Here white should be looking to expand his moyo at the top]

(;W[cp]LB[co:A]C[[SC\] Black failed to punish this move.  It is much safer to push with A.  See variations.]

(;B[cq];W[co];B[ni]LB[oh:A]C[Playing A is better, as it doesn't allow black to play a forcing move.]
;W[ph];B[oh];W[pi];B[ek];W[dk]C[[SC\] A necessary move.];B[ej]
;W[ei]C[[SC\] This is good, taking profit on the left...];B[fi]
;W[eh];B[dl];W[cl];B[el];W[em]LB[fc:C][ic:A][fd:B]C[This is a gote move, and worth little, so best saved for the endgame.  It would be much better to take the top edge.]
;B[en];W[cm];B[fg]LB[fh:A]C[[SC\] This is an overplay.  White can push with A and black ends up in a bad situation.]

(;W[ff];B[fh];W[eg];B[gf]
(;W[ge]LB[fe:A]C[[SC\] Better at A in my opinion];B[fe];W[ef]
;B[he];W[gd];B[hd]LB[hf:1]C[Now he has almost dominated the center and I did not know how to handle it, in almost every game I play
 I have the corner and my opponent has the center, this is the first time I lose that way though.

[SC\] Black has a weak point at 1.  White should exploit this.  See variation.]

(;W[fd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[db];B[cc]LB[cb:A]C[Here he is playing some bad moves if you ask me

[SC\] I'm afraid after your next move black could have lived! Fortunately he didnt spot it ;)

Next move should have been A.  See variations.]
(;W[fb]C[[SC\] Black could have lived here.  See variation.]

(;B[hc];W[cd]C[This move is very necessary];B[nd]C[[SC\] Very bad for white, he is being fenced in.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[ld];B[le];W[kd]C[Trying to reduce his center influence...]
;B[ke];W[jc]LB[jd:A]C[[SC\] A pushes more into blacks territory.]
;B[jd]C[Not really working];W[nc];B[pf]LB[og:A]C[[SC\] White has the forcing move of A

See variation]
(;W[qf];B[pe];W[qe];B[pd];W[pc];B[od];W[og];B[nh];W[ng]C[This move was a mistake, he cold have closed me off on q13 I think

[SC\] Correct!  This will be my last comment in the game, apart from the very last move, where I've included a small general summary.]

[SC\] Yes it would be almost hopeless now to invade the bottom.  Better to try when there is some hope of escaping to the centre.]

Thanks in advance, Hvatberinn, one of few Icelandic go players

Only 3 weeks of experience though...

[SC\] Generally in a game of go, you start by taking the corners, then expanding down the sides, and finally taking the center.  This is because it needs more moves to take territory in the center.

This game was unusual in that black was aiming to take the center from the beginning.  Whites main problem was that he was also concerned about the center when there were many bigger moves available.

Before you play a move, first check how much your move is worth, and whether there are any bigger moves.  This way you are playing in the most efficient way possible.

Other than that, well done - you play well for someone with only 3 weeks of experience!]
