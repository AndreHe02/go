C[Sampi: hi

This game was played in IGS, I was Black. I dont know exactly where I went wrong but by move 57 I think I was down 30 points.


Hi Sampi,

You played quite well in most of the sequences ; apart from a few little mistakes, the only thing you did wrong is attacking. You always got a very strong position, and put enemy groups under attack, but when time came to do it you chose the wrong DIRECTION. I think direction of play is one of the most important things at go ; you've got the feeling of it, apart from when you have to attack.

I'll detail this in the concerned moves, but as a general principle, you have to use your walls for attack by pushing enemy groups TOWARDS your walls, that is to say block them from the direction where you don't have stones. During the game you blocked your opponent's group from the direction of your walls, letting it escape in the center. 
But your opponent made several out of point moves by playing elsewhere, and you each time you managed to get the game back in your hands ; in the end you had almost killed your opponent group, and missed it from very little.

Not killing is not a problem, but attacking from the right direction is what you should try to do in the future.

There's a small and excellent book from Takemiya Masaki about cosmic style, moyo and attack ; it has been translated in french but I'm not sure whether it's available in english ... if it is, I advise you to get it !

Enjoy the game, and I'm pretty sure you'll get stronger very soon ;-)

Jean];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]LB[fq:A]C[I like Chinese fuseki but I've seen many pros play 'A' instead of my move first. How does this work, exactly?

Fuseki questions are always difficult, for usually even pros can't answer them with certainty ;-)  So I shall not try to give an explanation ...]
;W[nc];B[qf]SQ[qk]LB[pf:A][ne:B][oe:C]C[This is wrong. The right side is your moyo, and you have to develop it in a big fashion. Now that you've played 2 low moves, your moyo is a lot less efficient, for white doesn't even need to invade it ; later, white will always be able to reduce it from above. A is logical ; pincer the O17 stone might be another way. Even moves like B or C woul be more logical than your R14.]
;W[pb];B[ce]MA[pd][qf][qk]LB[qc:A][ph:B][jp:C][fq:D][ne:E][nf:F]
C[I felt I had miai (A and B) to live, so I played tenuki.

This is not exactly true. You don't only want life, you have to get more, for the right side is 4 black stones vs 0 white stones. So if you are forced to play B, you get overconcentrated ; with B plus the 3 crossed stones, you occupy a very small portion of the bard. 

The fact that the R14 stone is not well placed doesn't help, but in any case if you let white play A (and you can do it  indeed), you don't want to play B anyway. The C area is very big to expand your moyo (I'd play there right now instead of C15), and if you want to protect your two corner stones from being attacked, I'd rather play E or F to expand your moyo.]
;W[cg];B[ee];W[fd];B[fe];W[gd];B[ge];W[hd];B[di]C[I like influence so a high pincer seemed OK.]
;W[eg];B[cc];W[dd]
(;B[df]LB[dg:A][de:B]C[This is wrong : if white just connects at A, he still threatens to cut at B anyway. Now if you connect at B, your peep exchange is very very good for white, see the variation]
;W[cd]C[this is not best I think ; connect D13 first would be a lot better]
;B[dg];W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[ch];W[bg]C[I liked this exchange.

Indeed, you get sente which is quite important, so maybe this is a bit better for you ; white not connecting is the mistake for him.]

(;B[lc]C[this is a bit greedy ; I can understand very well that you don't want your opponent to get a large territory on the upper side ; on the other hand isn't it bigger to build your own moyo ?]

(;W[ld]LB[ne:A]C[this feels wrong ; attaching a weak invading stone is usually the wrong way to attack it.

As black I'd rather have this M17 stone at A for instance, to continue what you've been building all the way from the beginning ; so with white, i'd play O15 all the same]

C[This move would be better at J 13 I think. the sequence from 1 to 13 is joseki.]
;W[qc]SQ[hd][gd][fd][dc]LB[qd:A][ob:B]C[Here usually one answers at A ; for Q17 then could capture the corner in the future. White often answers at B ; but here with your top side group under the pressure of white's strengh, it might not be a good idea]
;B[ph]SQ[md][ld][kd][hd][nc][oc]TR[dg][ch][di][df][ee][fe][ge]
C[As I said before, you are really overconcentrated now. I'm not sure what to do though ; now that you gave white strength in exchange for the top side, your moyo is not good-looking anymore, and your left side influence doesn't work very well either.

I' think I'd play R16 anyway maybe, or just tenuki and take the lower side for instance. But it is a bit less attractive than before your invasion at the top.]
;W[jp]C[this is a big point.];B[ob]C[This was sente but maybe it was too early.

Indeed, you could wait and if your top group gets settled, then R16 would be better than P18]
;W[pc];B[cn]LB[bi:A][lp:B]C[Here your left side is still open at A, so it's going to be hard to make territory there. Maybe something like B would be interesting]
;W[cl]LB[bi:A][aj:B][cj:C][jp:D][fp:E]C[This is where all my problems started, really.

I'm not sure ; here you are a bit behind, and in the game you manage to get a good position I think ; and you could even have done better. I'm not sure I like this C8 move ; as white has A or B anytime, or a sente C to deal with your left side, I think he should defend normally, say E.]
;B[en]C[Ok, this is the right way.];W[el]C[I don't like this.]
;B[fp]C[good.];W[eq];B[fq];W[fr]C[Maybe the variation is better.]

;W[er]
(;B[cp]SQ[cl][el]TR[jp]LB[hq:A][gn:B]C[I don't think this is the right direction. White has the delta stone alone in your moyo (which revives thanks to the influence you get here), and the square stones are floating among your strength. I think you have no reason to erase slightly the corner as you do here ; playing at A (or B ?) instead would settle your group, and threaten quite strongly the K4 stone. White would have two very weak groups ; I think you'd be almost winning.

See variations];W[cq]C[Do you see that this attaching move is wrong, now ? You don't really get a base for your group, but let the corner live and lose sente ... with 2 white groups to attack, this is a big loss.]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[do];W[mq]SQ[el][cl]LB[hr:A][gl:B]C[Now white plays first, and the A aji is still there.

On the other hand, from white's 2 weak groups, the K4 stone is certainly not the weaker. So getting the marked stones out with B would be better in my opinion.]
;B[qo]LB[po:A]C[A is more logical if you hope to attack this white group.]
;W[hr];B[ep]LB[gr:A]C[oops. Unfortunately this is not sente. This is the second time you almost lose a move, but the game is still complicated anyway. That's to say how well you had managed to turn the tables up to the hane A.]
;W[gq];B[dq];W[dr]
(;B[fj]LB[gl:A]C[You can directly attack at A ; see variation at G4.]
;W[gl]CR[il]LB[mq:A]C[This is the vital point ; instead of A I think white should have played it directly.]

(;B[hj]TR[ge][fe][ee][df][dg]C[It's a bit painful for you to make no use of your "delta influence" while chasing ; once again, you have to push the enemy group towards your strength ; that is to say force it to flee vertically to meet your walls, and block the center.]
;W[bj]LB[bi:A][cj:B]C[This feels wrong. Waiting to play later at A (or B) would be more logical in my opinion.]
;B[bh]LB[bi:A]C[Maybe you can try for a more severe answer at A.]
;W[re]C[White errs again ; he has to strenghten his weak group]

[eh][eg]TR[ge][fe][ee][df][dg][gp][fp][ep]LB[fj:A][hj:B][hn:C]
C[I don't know if you'll find my review interesting or not, but something I really think you can learn from this game is the direction of attack. Here you have attacked this group from A, B and C ; that is to say, you prevented  the enemy group to go towards your strength. What you want to do when attacking a weak group is exacly the opposite : you can't enclose it, as it can flee on 3 directions usually, but you have to push it towards your walls, that is to say block the direction where you have no strength waiting for him. Pushing enemy groups towards your walls are the way to use walls, not building the "square" territory, which is too small. 

So your stones at A, B and C are kind of repetitions of what your other stones (the walls) already do. As a result, white gets to the center, and has the empty space in front of him.

I hope I have been clear enough ; you had been doing very well, with a few small mistakes, but you understood the game much better than your opponent by getting a position with a big moyo and several weak opponent groups to attack and even kill, and here you don't get profit from it.
If you pay very close attention to the direction of attack in the future, i'm pretty sure you'll get quite stronger.]

(;W[qm]SQ[hn][jn][ln]LB[gr:A][hq:B][ml:C][jj:D][ik:E]C[Maybe I didn't stress enough the importance of the capture of your A stone. During the sequence in the corner, I proposed to defend at B, to prevent this kind of thing to happen. Here you get a wall due to your attack of the other weak group, but it is of no  importance with respect of the bottom, as white is already alive. Had the A stone been protected, the K4 stone would be in deep danger, and fleeing with the left side group would have hurt very much white's bottom. Here it's not the case, which is very annoying for you.


Here white makes another very bad move. Once again he has to strenghten his weak center group ; jumping at C would be good enough. D might look like good shape, but you have E to attack (threatening to cut at H8), so it would not be good I think.

[ik:B]C[I see a huge black center here. You can't but be winning ;-)

Here, let's say that white has an eye on the edge, even though playing at A instead of B12 would have deleted it I think ; so you just need to prevent a second eye. As white's best chance for a second eye seems to be with his "circle" stones in the center, you just need to play the shape move at B (the 4th move a a bamboo join, always important), then block the center anywhere I think.]

Here white is dead, you don't need to play G7 as there is no eye here, even if white plays first. So the last place where white could make an eye is the center, and anything would kill (A looks like the clearest)]

There's a good principle to keep in mind when you're creating a moyo : as long as you can build bigger than your opponent, you don't need to enter his sphere of influence, as you did with the c15 approach. You can just continue to build your own moyo (as I said K4 for instance). Then your opponent will have to invade your moyo first ; there'll be time later for you to approach his strength.]
