;B[pd]C[Hi, thanks for reviewing this game.  I played black.  I'd appreciate pointers on general strategic errors I made, and perhaps alternate lines of play.  Basically, I don't see where I made 40 points worth of mistakes in the game.
I've also included specific questions in the game record.];W[pq]

;B[og];W[qn];B[jp]C[Another player told me that k4 is inconsistent with the Chinese opening, and around d10 was better here.  Is this correct?  I was concerned with white's extension from the shimari.

I agree with the other player. Assume a black play at d10 and a white play at k4.
Then black has a nice double wing formation and the white stones are mostly
on one side.

But I think this is a minor problem.];W[lq];B[fq];W[dn];B[fo]
C[Instead of f5 I would prefer a move around d10. I think the f3 and k4 stones are a light formation. It is not easy for white to get a severe attack.]
;W[cj];B[ch];W[ej];B[dc]C[Is there a better alternative play here?

To my feeling e16 looks better.];W[eq];B[ql]C[This r8 is small, because black can not expect much territory around r10.
Maybe e12 is bigger.];W[jd]C[what's the best way to handle this invasion?  I decided to push the stone while making territory on the left, but in the process the invading stone became very strong.

I think black should push only once and then play the normal shape move l18.  (See variation) l18 serves as a connection for the stones on the q line and teh white stones are weaker. There is not much territory around f14, especially as black needs two moves (j15 and e12) to surround it. And it is still open.]

Black gets in trouble after this. The correct shape is o17.]

C[I'm lucky to win this ko, i think.

I agree. The white threat is not so big.];W[fh];B[fg];W[eg]
;B[ff];W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[df]C[The position looks equal to me.]
;W[ib];B[hb];W[jb];B[nq]C[This invasion works very badly.  How to reduce the double wing in the corner?  What were other urgent plays at this stage?

I think this invasion is one of the reasons for your loss.
The three black stones to the left are rather weak than strong. So white can get a splitting attack with m5.

Black s12 is sente against the upper right white group. So maybe a calm reduction with a move like s6 is enough. This would give black some extra territory around s10.

Black has a lot of definite territory. Now is the time to look after ones weak stones and reduce the white formations carefully.]
;W[lo];B[no];W[on];B[nn];W[om];B[rg]C[This is bad shape which leaves cutting points. Better s12.]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[qg];B[rh];W[pi];B[qj];W[pj];B[qe]C[Trying to kill is unreasonable. Black should defend the cut at o13 and force white to live.
Like this the outer white stones would be a lot weaker.];W[re]

;B[rm];W[rn];B[rk];W[ef];B[ee];W[di];B[de];W[lm];B[pp]C[any hope for b in the corner?

I don't see a promising variation for black.  If this fails white gets even stronger outside and black will shurly lose.   Black should play from the outside like l3. He sells his stones around o3 and gets
safty for his k3 group. Then he is the first to play the big double sente moves like b11.   With a play like this its still a long way for white.]

;W[kn];B[nr];W[rr];B[ko];W[kp];B[jo];W[mn]C[Now the white corner is bigger and white gets additional territory in the middle.
White leads at least by 20 points.];B[kq];W[lp];B[lr];W[kr]
;B[jq];W[mr];B[cq]C[any hope with this invasion?  e3 isn't really shimari so maybe I should be able to play for a ko, but I don't see it.

The black stones around h4 are too weak for this invasion.]
;W[fr];B[gq]C[Now white b4 should kill the c3 stone and the white territory is even bigger.]
;W[gr];B[cp];W[co]C[Black should try to live now and hope to survive with his h4 stones. (See variation)]

;W[kb];B[la];W[ka];B[sa];W[ii];B[pm];W[sq]C[I think black lost this game mainly because of the invasion at o3. The following splitting attack gives white the lead.

The margin of the loss gots bigger because of unreasonable play by black. Especially the play with the invading stones and the attempt to kill the upper right white stones.

It seems that black felt he was behind and tried some desperate variations. This is the reason for the big loss.]
