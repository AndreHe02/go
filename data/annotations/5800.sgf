C[wossname [1k\]: hi'
apagis [2d\]: hi
apagis [2d\]: have a nice game
wossname [1k\]: you too];B[pc]C[Hi and thanks for looking, there aren't too many questions in here. I'm mostly interested in fuseki, and maybe the later middle game that takes place after a critical ko is ended (maybe the critical ko is played in a silly matter, but whether proper or not game entered different phase after)]
;W[qp];B[cq]C[Question 1 -

What is the best direction for white now? I could not decide on a move here.. I am not sure I am satisfied with how things went after move 3.

Basti: Ask a pro.];W[dc]C[I ended up choosing this because C3 does not seem it can build much using an approach against this stone, but it seems unfortunate that it shares the key point of k17 with the other corner.~?

Basti: I wouldn't worry too much about this. I doubt that there is a correct or a wrong move here and if there is the difference would be very small.]
;B[jq];W[qe];B[od]C[Another fuseki juncture... honestly no idea what is largest or best here.]
;W[nq]C[I ended up choosing this to prevent k3 from building too efficiently by approaching r4, and to open up possibility of breaking the rather long bottom extension. but I'm not happy with the overall prospects for white here.
Basti: I think the lower side is not too important. K3 and C3 are both low so black will never build too much territory here. Shimari in the upper left would be the logic move.]
;B[qk];W[qh]C[simple move to settle r15. doesn't seem i can skip this?
Basti: Your move is ok.];B[qn];W[ck]C[This move felt strange, buti couldn't think of a really good choice here. I'm occupying a key point for c3 to extend to, but probably I shouldn't worry too much about the development of c3 at this point? Yet, extending at top seems rather inefficient to me. Should I occupy the top middle point just because it is key point for P16? should I choose a more conservative extension on this side? should i build shimari?

Basti: This move looks strange. I would play the shimari.];B[jc]
C[i feel that b is a bit more efficient now];W[ce]C[Is this my best choice?

Basti: I can't find a better move. C9 is in a strange position now. It should be at D5 for example.]
;B[gc]C[B seems to have made very solid, good extension along top. I feel slow now...]
;W[rc]C[So of course I pick slow move here. but allowing R16 seemed like a terrible possibility. chose this also to open up the chance at attacking r9 extension... is there a bigger point for me to think of?
Basti: I think this move is ok.];B[ld]C[I thought this was quite slow, but it does remove the primary reduction at l16. Still confused about next best move... repeating theme I guess :`(]
;W[hq]C[is this bad?
Basti: no];B[lq];W[pp]C[Basti: You can extend at e3. It's difficult for black to invade the corner when R6 and M3 are weak.]
;B[fq];W[gp];B[fp];W[gn];B[fo];W[go]C[here?
Basti: yes];B[kn];W[mn]C[This move felt natural and I did not think too long, my only thought was to somehow gain compensation by attacking one group or the other. But is it good?
Basti: I think so.];B[in];W[fn]C[although I'd like to open attack by attaching at S9 right away, i felt this turn was prerequisite move. This lead to a gote sequence for me, which I think is where I really fell far behind]
;B[en];W[em];B[dm];W[el]C[Basti: A little soft. You can play d8 and the shape would be a little better.]
;B[dl];W[dn];B[eo];W[dk];B[cn];W[gl]C[Too slow? Maybe I can't afford to make this move right now. I felt like I needed it though
Basti: I would play at E10. Black gets a peep but it would be much more difficult to invade the left side.]
;B[dh]C[This move, when I first saw it, seemed like an invitation for me to take some lead. But in the end my attack failed.]
;W[fh]C[Did I choose wrong direction? Is there some way I can profit from the presence of 2 weak groups and 1 nearly weak?
Basti: It would be correct to hunt the group towards your wall for example with E13.]
;B[ef];W[eg]C[Basti: This way to cut is usually bad. Correct would be to start with d13 but here it doesn't work, too.]
;B[df];W[ff];B[fe];W[cf];B[dg];W[ee]C[Basti: This can't work. I would leave the position for now and start an attack on the lower right groups.]
;B[gf];W[fg];B[de];W[ed];B[dd];W[fc];B[fd];W[ec];B[cd];W[bh]

C[Well, the group lived, but at a great loss. After this sequence, I counted roughly that Black had 60 points to my 30 points.]
;B[bg];W[ch];B[cg]
(;W[rk]C[Basti: This move helps black. The standart moves would be S8 or S7 but black can manage them easily too. White should start the attack on the other group.]

C[We did a mini review after, but apagis couldnt easily spot my mistakes. He did comment that he wishes he had replied to this threat, since he had many other local threats. But he ignored this, and 2nd phase of game began.]

;B[jr];W[mp];B[hm]C[In retrospect, I wish I had played H10 and let black live, then switched to right and killed his group. Might have had enough to win then. Instead, I made an empty triangle to prevent black from cutting k9.. Fighting continued and eventually black made 2 eyes, and the white attacking group found itself with only 1 eye and died.]

;W[nr];B[kr];W[oi];B[sk];W[si];B[ro];W[rp];B[pl];W[pj]C[Basti: White is leading by komi now.]
;B[ah];W[cm];B[do];W[bm];B[bi];W[cl]C[Basti: Here white dies. B9 instead would create one eye. White can create a second eye with G9 or F2. This is the last comment.]
