C[Hi Mirco, I hope my review will help you. Please feel free to send me a mail if you have any more questions about the game or my comments.

Have fun!

Kirsten


In this game i tried some variation.

The central point of this game seems to be the attck and defence. It might be the skill go trought my rank.

I added some comments to.

;W[kf]C[w is grateful, you force him to stabilize his moyo. an invasion in the upper left becomes difficult now.
your position around m16 is quite over-concentrated.];B[fn]

(;W[mo]C[you are right, p5 is a common move. but n5 doesn't look bad either.

two possibilitities now. defend like you did, or attack from top. if you attack from top w should be able to make life somehow, but you gain strength which you can use to start an invasion in w's moyo.]
