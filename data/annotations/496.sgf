;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dc];B[kq]C[You have played the low chinese opening, good for making territory and thickness.]
;W[fq]C[Usually white should do a corner enclosure at D15, C15 or near that points. Usually the knight aproach at f3 is bad for white, better play at p4 if he thinks an approach is needed, but it is bigger to play a big point like q10.]
;B[hq]C[It is better to attack white by the other side with e3, making his group heavy and good to attack, h3 is too low.]
;W[fp]C[I think this is too slow for escape, better a one point jump at f5.]
;B[ho]C[H5 attack white but by the black strong side, so he is helping white to get strengh and the black stone at d4 is starting to look very weak.]
;W[dn]C[A strong attack by white];B[eo]C[Good idea, when your opp. try to surround you, you must try to split him in two and poke your head to the center.]
;W[cq];B[fo]C[Difficult decision, probably i would played at d3 first separating the three white stones, and if white c4 then e6 making a leaning attack on white and killing the three stones in a bigger way.]
;W[dq]C[white now is safe in the corner, and all the black corner territory is now white and black dont have any compensation for this.]
;B[co]C[Very small move for black the board is full of better points, d15 i think it is best, but q10, r14 are very good also.



The corner group it is safe, and the lone white stone dont deserve such attack.]
;W[do];B[ep];W[cp];B[eq];W[er];B[dr]C[bad cut];W[fr]C[He have show you why it is bad]
;B[em]C[

You are making a big territorial frame, or moyo, but helping white to get real territory, maybe playing the other big points it is bigger.]
;W[cm]C[

 safe move, but d7 seems even better];B[qf]C[Good, you have a lot of strengh in the left side and you have to use it.]
;W[qe]C[

Bad play for white.

The diagonal contact is only played when white have a stone at q10 or near, because then black cant have two eyes in the side and must run into the center.

But that is not the position now, so the  white corner is open and black can make a really big territory.

White better moves was a pincer at q10 or closer.];B[pf]C[

 good move];W[nc];B[qj]C[Maybe better playing it high at q10 to keep the right side balanced, r4 low, q10 high. Now the whole side is low.]
;W[oq]C[white invasion is too deep and he must be punished for this. Black maybe cant kill him, but must make a lot of point attacking him now]
;B[pq]C[That is one of the possibilities, but i think it is better to play the contact move p4 to make a wall and the right side is all black.]
;W[op];B[pn]C[This is the usual way to attack white after playing q3. Good :)]
;W[nn];B[no]C[Too agressive, better to attack white in a more safer way like o7 doing points while attacking.]
;W[oo];B[on];W[or];B[mo]C[You have get the cut you where searching for, but it is good ?



Your corner is weak and white stones are very strong so he have a lot of possibilities open for him, like r5, r2.]
;W[qr];B[pr];W[qq]C[Strong move];B[pp];W[ps];B[de]C[I think you played d15 which is a really important move, as a ladder breaker, but the main fight is not the o6 stone but white corner group which is not alive yet ¡.]
;W[rp];B[qo]C[S5 is probabibly better but riskier, but you have lost one full corner and now the second, so you must fight back.]
;W[cd];B[ce];W[fd];B[ci];W[dk];B[fl]C[The moves played at the left side has been good for both players, but f8 is definitively not. Attacking white right corner group with n2 or s5 or even s2 is clearly better in my opinion.



Other good moves are o7 catching o6 stone and making a lot of territory or b9 attacking white while securing your group]
;W[fj];B[ej]C[You try to cut a knight jump again, it is possible, but many times is it not good if you are not strong enough in the area, so your opponent can attack you.]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[jj]C[light, flexible play by white erasing your central moyo and breaking the ladder of o7]
;B[ei]C[I think d10 is probably better as it put more pressure on d9 white stones. The ladder at g10 it is broken so it is difficult for you to kill f10 and even so it is not a important stone for white.]
;W[gh];B[gf];W[hf];B[hg]C[You try to cut white center stones but you are weak to play h13, maybe at h15 as a sacrifice was better.]
;W[gg];B[ff];W[ig];B[if]C[Instead of j14 it is better to play the atari at h15, white h12 and then try to invade white upper side.]
;W[hh];B[he];W[hg];B[jd]C[I think g16 defending the cut it is better.]
;W[ef]C[white try to explore your weakness.];B[ee];W[fe];B[eg]
;W[ge];B[fg];W[ie]C[white have get a really large territory at top. So he is leading in territory now clearly.]
;B[jf];W[hd];B[je];W[mf]C[now you are the one who have a heavy, easy to attack group. So you dont have time to play at p10 to make you territory bigger.]
;B[lc];W[oj]C[p10 is the vital point for both players of the black formation in the right side.]
;B[ng]C[with your top group so weak, i think it is better to try to rescue it, with j18 or h17 for example.]
;W[mg];B[mh]C[Too agresive, you must play at o12.

By now you must have see that your opp was stronger than you at fighting. So when you hane, be always prepare for the cut, if not, dont hane, or you will be into difficulties.]
;W[nh];B[og];W[ni];B[li]C[Now you have another weak group to rescue. That is very bad for you better forget n13 stone and try to get life for k16 group.]
;W[lh];B[mi];W[kg];B[hc]C[Good, but now you are more surrounded than before, so it is more difficult to live.]
;W[gc];B[hb];W[gb];B[id];W[he];B[lk]C[Big mistake, your group it is not safe yet, you must play another move at k18.

That is the vital point of this shape, it is very important to play there, for you to live, for your opp to kill you.]
;W[kc];B[ld]C[Better played at l16, when you are weak usually you must play contact moves, when you attack dont touch the enemy stones.]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[jb]C[Now you are stuck, if you conect at j17 he cuts at n17 if you play at n17 he at j17. this is know as miai, either way you are lost, so better try to save the n11 stones. That is the problem of having two, or more, weaks groups, when defending one, you are weakening another.]
;B[mc];W[ic];B[nd];W[od];B[oc];W[pc];B[nb];W[ne];B[me];W[le]
;B[lf]C[At least you have get a ko :)];W[md];B[bn];W[bo];B[me]
;W[po];B[qn];W[md];B[bp];W[nc];B[bq];W[cr];B[bm]C[Before playing b7 you must play one atari more at b2, and then eat the a5 stone, then your group would be safe.



Now if he eat your c5 stone you are dead.];W[cn];B[ao];W[bl]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[dl];W[am];B[co];W[el];B[dm];W[bo];B[nd];W[me]
C[Bad move, now you have a chance];B[co];W[lj];B[en]C[A good exchange for you :)]
;W[mj];B[go]C[This is not an important point to play now, and it is gote, lose the iniciative, better to play at b2, or g2, s5 or s2.



At this moment, keeping sente is very very important.];W[ki]
C[An unnecesary move by white also];B[br]C[Good :)];W[ds];B[bs]
;W[cs];B[gr];W[fs];B[mr]C[Very good moves, securing your group and keeping sente.]
;W[ro];B[rn];W[rr];B[nl]C[Maybe too loose, your r10 stone is weak and the r14 group also, so better try to secure the connection with r12.]
;W[qg]C[He is strong so he invade.];B[qh]C[

Probably better at s13 trying to connect.];W[rf];B[rg]C[Good, if you get that stone you probably can live.]
;W[pl]C[

He cahnge the attack to the other side.];B[pb]C[Very difficult for you to make life for that group, better let it to ko fights, or later. But you are losing so taking risk is OK.]
;W[qb];B[ql]C[

This is good move for you :)];W[jm];B[km]C[I am not sure of what is the best answer to the white invasion. I dont like any :(]
;W[jl];B[jn];W[kk];B[ll];W[cf];B[be];W[df];B[cg];W[bf];B[bc]
C[Big Mistake.



You can kill the white stones, but you must take his liberties out playing at d13 or b13. Now your b15-e15 stones have 4 liberties and white only three. But ...]
;W[bd]C[Now you can kill white also, but you both are 3 liberties each, so you MUST play at a14,b13 or d13]
;B[cc]C[You both are still 3 liberties each, but now are white turn so ...]
;W[ae]C[He kill you :(];B[hk]C[Bad direction of play, you are open by k7-k8 stones so cant make territory there, and dont take away much white territory either.]
;W[hj];B[hm];W[ik];B[hl]C[

The bambu knot are very good :)];W[gk];B[bg]C[Why dont answer at g8?. White can now take away your new territory]
;W[ed];B[re]C[Good move but gote. Probably bigger to cut the white q8 stone with q9.]
;W[rd];B[sf];W[mq];B[lq];W[lp];B[mp];W[nq];B[ko];W[ol];B[db]
C[Very very difficult to live there without a big mistake by white, but trying is free so if you dont lose sente it doesnt matter much.]
;W[eb];B[bb];W[ca];B[da];W[ac];B[ea];W[fa];B[nr]C[Small and gote]
;W[gl]C[much bigger];B[ns]C[Big mistake. You must play f7



Now the white dead stones at c9-e9 can connect and by that your left side group at b13 is very weak.



It is also very bad shape, so you probably end in gote. Better play other points in sente like t16. But of course the best move is f7.]
;W[os];B[sq]C[Same commentary, must connect at f7.



If you want to kill white, what it is impossible now, you must throw at r1 first then play at t3.



But it dont work because white can play at m2, your empty triangle, and get easyly life.



So the proper move now would be m2 and if white dont make a deffensive move, then kill him.]
;W[lr]C[

 White have read it well];B[fm]C[At last :)];W[nm];B[mm]C[You can cut directly at p7.



If he ataries at n8, you extend o8 white must play at n9 and then you atari at n7 and kill white.]
;W[om];B[nk];W[ok];B[mn];W[qk];B[rk];W[qm];B[rm];W[rl];B[sl]
;W[ql];B[sk];W[qi];B[ri];W[pi];B[ph];W[pj];B[rj];W[oh];B[sd]
C[

This time you have managed the strong attack very well. :)]
;W[rc];B[sc];W[sb];B[se];W[gm];B[gn];W[gj];B[oa]C[This group is beyond hope i think.



If i were white i would play tenuki, play in another part of the board, or at r19.



This way you get the ko again :)];W[nc];B[ba]C[Bad ko threat, you are dead even if he connect the ko as he should.



Better ko threats are d13,s3,r1, o4, k17 ...];W[ob];B[cb];W[ab]
C[he shows you that you are death in the upper left corner.]
;B[aa]C[Pointless];W[ca];B[dg]C[

Good move];W[dd]C[To finish the commentary i think that you have to improve your fighting skills and try to read if you can hane or not, for example. Also very important to know and use the sente-gote concept.]
