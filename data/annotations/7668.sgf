;B[qd];W[pp];B[dq];W[dd]C[Good influential opening to counter blacks territorial opening.]
;B[qm];W[kq]C[This is a bit long, just asking for an invasion.]
;B[qq]C[Like this.];W[qp]C[A good proverb here is "Block on the wider side" (look up on Sensei's Library if you haven't heard of it before, good explanation there, just google Sensei's Library if you haven't been there either).  Q3 probably would've been better, allowing your influence to net you the most territory.]
;B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[rp];W[ro];B[sp];W[so];B[rq];W[nr]
C[Good Joseki so far, but this move leaves bad aji at R5, so if you're going to play local you should play there.  If you want to ignore it, save this move for later and play bigger like attacking either of black's corners.]
;B[os];W[ns];B[pr];W[oo]C[This works to protect as well, but still leaves possible aji at R5.]
;B[pj];W[dj];B[gc];W[gd];B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[ie]C[This hane may be a good move and response locally, but look at the big picture and what black did after this.  I would probably stretch back, hane on his left side, then attack his corner.]
;B[jd];W[je];B[kd];W[ke]C[You're letting him build a large territory here, I would suggest attacking the upper right corner than letting black stretch more territory.  However, you are doing a good job of building influence, which is my preferred style as well.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[be];W[bd];B[ch];W[df]C[Don't worry about attacking black's stones at this point.  If you are equally matched, attacking stones will likely lead to nothing.  Therefore, only attack if there is something else you're getting out of it.]
;B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[ci]C[Another proverb, touch to defend.  Likewise, if you want to attack something, touching it usually isn't the best idea and typically winds up strengthening your opponent locally.]
;B[bi];W[bj];B[ai]
(;W[eh]C[Play bigger.   A big move here would be to stretch down the left side, maybe even so far as to attack the corner.]
;B[dh]
(;W[di]TR[dj][ci]C[This is bad shape.];B[de];W[ee];B[ei];W[aj]
C[This is a ploy to escape through your E13 stones.];B[eg]TR[eh]
C[Like this.  Stones like this are weak, with little support.  I'm sure you learned this, but I just want to make sure.]
;W[ef];B[fh];W[bh];B[bg];W[ah];B[fd];W[fe];B[ec];W[ed];B[fc]
;W[gf]C[Good, your groups there were in trouble.];B[hh];W[fg]
C[Play bigger elsewhere.  An attack on the lower left like D5 would be huge right now.  You need to get some territory to match blacks upper right corner.  Influence is only good when it gets you territory in the long run, or supports you in a battle.]
;B[eh];W[gh];B[gi];W[gg];B[hj];W[kn]C[Play bigger.  That's a theme I'm seeing here.  Sometimes, it's best to ignore a move locally if you can get away with it so you can play a bigger move elsewhere.  G3 would've been better.  In general, development should begin in the corners, extend to the sides, then span to the middle.  So while there are still sides to go for, grab them.]
;B[co];W[gq]C[Good, but black has already strengthend the corner, so this is late.]
;B[ip];W[iq];B[in];W[jp];B[jo];W[ko];B[im]C[Black is building a moyo there in that corner. (Which, in retrospect, you do a good job later to invade)]
;W[jm];B[om]C[I would start moving into blacks upper right hand corner now before it gets further solidified.  A hane at M16 or an attack at P16 might work well.]
;W[qn];B[rm];W[rn];B[mn];W[mo];B[pg]C[This is a big move.  Right now, none of your stones really control any territory, except on the bottom and that's small.  This is a result of playing slowly in the beginning.  Influence is a good way to play, but it is only good when it is used to get territory eventually.  Here, black nullified all of your influence before it could do you any good.]
;W[jl];B[jj];W[ll]C[You can play bigger here, such as simply doing a knights move to L10.]
;B[nl];W[lj]C[Because this is a weak shape, with L9 being the key square.]
;B[nj];W[ki];B[mh];W[kg]C[You've succesfully connected two probably alive groups (the top one is contested, but a hane at M16 probably could've changed that), but you haven't gained any territory from it.  In the beginning of the game, you want to play big so as to exert influence over as much territory as possible.  Battles between groups aren't important until the late middle game to the end game.  Worry more about gaining territory than killing your opponent's groups.]
;B[mg];W[lf];B[md]C[Now you're pretty much stuck out of the corner, and black has won.]
;W[pc];B[pd];W[qc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[pa];B[rc];W[od];B[nc]
;W[rb];B[rd];W[sc];B[oe];W[sd];B[se];W[sb]C[Nice try, but no matter what would happen you would just end up living small and strengthening black.  In some cases, even just a little is good but this is too little too late and winds up strengthening black.]
;B[re]
(;W[qb]C[Unnecessary.];B[ra];W[na];B[ma];W[oa];B[mb];W[fo];B[hl]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[em];B[cm]C[This was a good move to puncture black's moyo, but black still gets the corner and adds insult to injury.]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[dk];B[ej];W[ek];B[fk];W[gm];B[gl];W[hm];B[il]
;W[kk]C[I would say at this point moves like this are pointless, since it doesn't net you any territory.  There is still some territory to gain and protect, like the bottom left corner.]
;B[mf];W[kh];B[ih];W[hg];B[ji];W[jg];B[ig];W[if];B[jh];W[kj]
;B[jk];W[kl];B[fr];W[gr];B[al];W[bk];B[bl];W[fq];B[er];W[eq]
;B[dr];W[dp];B[cp];W[do];B[dc];W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[ca];W[ba]
;B[db];W[bc]C[This is a lost point for you.];B[hp];W[hq];B[go]
;W[gp];B[gn];W[fn];B[io];W[hn];B[ho];W[jn];B[pn];W[qo]C[If this was meant to be defensive, wait until he forces you to move here before you do.  Preempting black does nothing when there are bigger moves still.]
;B[on];W[no];B[ln];W[lo];B[mm];W[nn];B[nm];W[lm]C[Playing stictly responsive go doesn't get you anywhere.]
;B[mj];W[mk];B[nk];W[ml];B[le];W[lg];B[dn];W[en];B[dm];W[el]

;B[ar];W[ic];B[ib]C[Good uses of aji, when you're behind these are good things to try.  Make sure you don't overuse it though.  Practicing tsumego will help you know when and where to attack.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[mi];B[ni];W[li];B[is];W[hr];B[jr];W[jq];B[sa]

;W[pk];B[qk];W[pl];B[tt];W[pm];B[ql]C[For example, this invasion was almost dead from the 5th move.  That's why black kept passing.  Note that each time you move in black's territory, and black doesn't respond, black is getting another point for a captured stone and isn't losing a point for moving inside black's own territory.  Be careful, a few points here or there is worth it but black got a bit out of this.]

So, you can tell by my repetiveness what the themes I saw were.  Good moves locally, just keep in mind the big picture.  Feel free to contact me on KGS if you have any questions, or want to play a teaching game.  Hope I helped,
