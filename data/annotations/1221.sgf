;B[pd]C[dear reviewer,

i played w in this game.  i won in the end thanks to komi (5.5), and i'd like to know whether there were places where i could've made better, more effective moves.

thanks!

cheers,
ken];W[dp];B[pp];W[cc];B[pj];W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[op]C[i wasn't sure what to do at this point.  thought about n5, but that would seem to give b sente (for, say, r16) since w'd need to protect against n3 cut (var 2).  thus 2 questions:  is the above reasoning correct?  and is what w actually played (b3) ok?

--

I would certainly play n5. Having two solid stones like n4 and n5 pointing straight into Black's moyo is just what he doesn't want to see. I don't think sente is particularly important in this position. There can't be anything very wrong with n3, though.]

(;W[mq]C[This];B[mo];W[pr]C[I'm sure q2 is bad. In this game, the middle of the board is much more important than the corner - and anyway, you wouldn't normally want to play on the second line like this unless you needed to make life quickly. o3-n4 stones are strong, so you should keep pushing at M5. Don't worry that he will get a wall - you will get one too.]
;B[lo]C[And getting m5 makes black very happy - now he has a strong two stones pointing into your area, and his framework on the right is building up beautifully - compare this with what happens if you'd played n5 when you had the chance: it's the same shape.

The bottom side is now uninteresting (no-one will make territory there, and both sides have strong stones to connect to so there won't be much of a fight). This also makes d4 look worse, as one of the purposes of the star-point stone is to support on the side.

I think b is ahead here.];W[qq];B[qp];W[rq]C[B could consider ignoring s3.]

(;B[rp];W[nj]C[felt this might be a little premature, but it worked out okay, i think.

-

This maybe makes sense as a reducing move - if black had played q12, were you planning on leaving o10 alone and playing elsewhere? Normally you wouldn't want to get involved in a fight near black's strength like this, at least not while there are good points to develop with on the other side of the board.]
;B[nk]C[I think o9 was bad. Now it looks like black will be overconcentrated in the bottom right, whatever he does. Touching a weak stone like this is only likely to make it stronger, and doing so from the side of his strong wall isn't going to make full use of it.]
;W[oj]C[Normally butting into a stone like this (when o9 is there already) is a bad idea...]
;B[ok]C[...because you end up with this 'hane at the head of two stones' shape. But here, you're just trying to settle quickly, and it seems to work ok whatever black does. Black is already badly overconcentrated in the bottom-right.]
;W[pi]C[Good.];B[qi];W[qj];B[pk];W[qh];B[ri]C[didn't think it through...but now it looks as if w could've pushed down at s12...

-

I think your move is better. You could consider q12 instead of p12.]

(;W[oh]C[This move is fine. You can play s12 and force s10 next. The only way black can avoid this is to crawl along the second line while you play on the third, and you should be happy to see that happen.

Black should play elsewhere now, maybe o16 - you can't capture his two stones by playing s10 (though you could if p12 were at q12).]
;B[rh];W[qg];B[rg];W[qf]C[This move, especially, is a gift for white.]
;B[re]C[And this is very bad. All these second line moves are of low value, and this leaves bad aji if black really thinks it's a connection.]
;W[pb]C[I'm not sure about this. Were you aiming at the bad aji in the corner? The q16 stone isn't really weak, and he might build up strength to attack your group below. Black doesn't need to keep his connection along the edge if q16 becomes strong anyway.]
;B[qe];W[nc]C[nice breathing space

-

Yes! White is doing well now.];B[mj];W[nh];B[nd];W[mc];B[md]
C[Here black is 'pushing the cart from behind', which is normally bad. He needs something special out of the attack on your group below to make up for it.]
;W[lc];B[mh];W[mg];B[ni]
(;W[lh]C[I'm not so sure about this move - what if black just answers at n11?]

(;B[oi]C[Anyway, as soon as black plays this, white is out of danger.]
;W[mi]C[This is good for white - black takes some profit where he was strong anyway, and it's not enough to make up for what he gave you on the top side.]
;B[ph]C[liked the exchange here

-

This move is far too slow for black - both groups are already strong, so this is just endgame.]
;W[ld]C[because w got sente to play m16.
  -

good!];B[dd]C[maybe b should've approached from the left, say d14 or c15?

-

Yes, that looks better. White is very strong in the centre now, so this stone just looks like it's going to make a weak group.]

(;W[dc]C[should w have played some kind of pincer from the right?    w's direction is correct?

-

You should surely answer the contact move directly. I think you chose the right direction - compare the two variations I give.]

(;B[cd]C[This is bad - it leads to the same bad shape as p10 earlier, but this time white isn't being made overconcentrated.]
;W[ed]C[Good. Now black has the bad 'hane at the head of two stones' shape.]
;B[ee];W[fd];B[fe]C[Again, black is pushing the cart from behind - but this time he is having to give you fourth line territory!]
;W[gd]
(;B[df]C[is d14 necessary?  feels b's too slow.  or is b being properly cautious?  could some kind of larger extention have worked for b?

-

This would normally be right, I think, but black is losing this game so maybe he should try something more dramatic. If he extends down the side, he has to make sure the extension is wide enough that he can sacrifice c16-d16 without being overconcentrated.]
;W[cj];B[ci];W[dj]C[I think this exchange is good for White.]
;B[fq];W[fp]C[a pincer from the right'd have created an isolated stone in a strong b formation; e5-f4-d6 would allow b to make a comfortable extention at bottom.  --  does this sound ok?

-

The area at the bottom is uninteresting for both sides, as I said before. I don't think your pincer stone would be weak, but it wouldn't be having any useful effect to its right, either.

e5-f4-d6 might be a good idea, as the group black made would have no particularly interesting development afterwards.]
;B[eq];W[ep]C[d3 is normally better, I think. You're maybe getting a little overcontentrated above, now.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[cr]C[Playing b3 now is rather slack shape; you do end up with a lot of stones above which aren't making enough territory, and there's still space for black to push into it (because he's so strong at n10 and m5). There's also a nasty cutting point left at c4.]

(;W[bq];B[br];W[jq]C[decided not to defend c4 because r3 seems bigger.  but this also makes me wonder whether w should not have bend at g3 rather than c3 instead in the first place....

-

I think c3 is right, rather than g3, - g3 would make c10-d10 would look even worse.

k3 is only a few points of endgame value - it doesn't effect the strength of any groups; it doesn't take away any black territory; it doesn't have any particularly interesting follow-up. Just half a dozen points of white territory.

Perhaps you should play something to defend the cutting point at c4.]
;B[gp]C[I think this is bigger than k3.];W[go];B[cp];W[co];B[bp]
;W[bo];B[aq];W[di]C[wanted sente for this.

--

The loss in the corner is large, and you have bad shape at d4-f4 as well. d11 is nice and thick towards the centre, but black is thick there as well so it's not clear how to take advantage. This move helps black settle his top-left group.]
;B[ch];W[ho];B[em]C[wouldn't b e6 be more effective?

-

e6 is normally the shape point to attack d4-f4 with, yes, But here I think black is more interested in being able to pull his stone out.]
;W[en]C[I think this just makes black stronger. I think d6 is better.]
;B[fm]C[You don't need to answer this.]
(;W[fn];B[dm];W[gk];B[gl];W[hl]C[Fighting here is too hard for me!]
;B[hm];W[il];B[fk];W[gj];B[fj];W[fi];B[im]
(;W[hi]C[this just seems necessary to protect d10 stones somehow.  and at this point, had great byoyomi pressure, so the next several moves are quite confused and not thought out at all.

-

This move does a great deal for your weaknesses; now if you turn at g15 you will have some territory in the centre.]
;B[jl];W[lj];B[lk];W[kk];B[kl];W[ll];B[mk];W[jk]
(;B[jn]C[Black has taken away your territory in the bottom left, but at least you're no longer overcontentrated. He's also expanded his bottom right. If you get to at g15 or h14, you will have a fair amound of compensation. I think you're doing ok in this game.

Instead of k6, I think black should probe at j9. If you sacrifice h8-j8 now, he will save a move by missing out k6, so you must answer at h9. That leaves him with the opportunity to do more damage in the centre.]
;W[gq]C[this is bigger than connecting at center, right?

-

It doesn't seem to actually capture g4. I can't read out the left-hand side to see if one move there will let you connect or at least make two eyes, but certainly this group would be in danger if it became cut off from the bottom (so now you see I was wrong about k3 being only endgame).]

(;B[kj];W[li];B[ik];W[jj];B[ij];W[ji];B[hk];W[hf]C[Good!

Now h4 is biggest for black, g2 for white.];B[ei];W[eh];B[ej]
;W[dh];B[dg];W[gh];B[bc];W[bb];B[bd];W[bj];B[bi];W[ai]C[felt i was doing okay at this point, just about even, with komi.  correct assessment?

-

I think whoever plays h4/g2 will win.];B[ah];W[aj];B[bg];W[gr]
C[Yes!];B[pg];W[of];B[pf];W[me];B[oc];W[ob];B[ne];W[nf];B[pc]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[rb];B[qd];W[qb];B[sb]C[too small?

-

Looks like four points reverse sente, so it's not bad at this stage of the game. The bottom-right corner is either four points double sente, or four points reverse sente with a follow-up, so it's bigger. The bottom side is big, too.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[sp];B[so];W[sq];B[ro];W[ge]C[is this a good move, even though it gave away sente?  any suggestion as to where i can use the sente?  r5?  d1?

-

I think it's small - it's only a point or so in sente if he pushes here, and I don't think he can do anything with the cutting point.

Something at the bottom looks biggest, maybe l4 (there's some aji at p2; I don't think it comes to anything, but l4 might help).

a18 is also big (not a17, or black will throw in).];B[fg];W[fh]
