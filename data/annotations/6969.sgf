AB[pd][dp]C[
Hi, my name is Jakob and i got destroyed in this game.
I can see some of my simpler errors, but afterall i would like some suggestion on how to improve my play.
I play as white.

thx in advance for reviewing this match.];W[qp]SQ[op]C[Ben:  I personally play on the 4-5 for every 2 and 3 stone handicap game I play.  A thick joseki tends to come in handy in these kinds of games.  

For an example of this see the annotated game In Ed Lasker's book Go and go-moku.

(Of course this move is by no means  more or less losing than the 4-5 play)]
;B[cd]
(;W[ec]C[Jakob: is this the right approach? or should i have made my own shimari instead? i felt that in a handicap game i should try to add some confusion to the board

Ben: Confusion is a good idea in a handicap game and this is a possible move.  See my variation for an alternative plan.]
;B[ed]
(;W[gc]MA[fd]C[Ben:  Really a play at X is necessary here.  I've actually expermented with this move myself  before -- unsuccessfully.  

A commentator at the gtl advised me not to do it anymore  ;)]
;B[dc];W[eb];B[db]C[Jakob: was this move necessary?

Ben: It does seem cautious.  F-16 looks a little more active, or tenuki.

On the other hand this move does have some merit.  It take the corner for black and gaurantees life.  And it probably keeps sente since W has to do something on the top now or the stones become heavy.]
;W[kc]C[Jakob: should i have made a kakari at O17 instead?

Ben: I like k-17 actually.  O-17 is too active.  W has to make strength somewhere otherwise B will shrug off any attacks.]
;B[nc]MA[ic]C[Jakob: here i felt like her shimari as a natural response made her happy

Ben:  Black gained here, X is a concern for W still.];W[ke]
C[Jakob: also my own follow-up move felt necessary but slow and gote

Ben: You are correct, but this was only because l-17 was bad.]
;B[op];W[pn]C[Jakob: i didnt know the joseki of what was to follow... was that ok? what were my other options?

Ben: Well tenuki is always an option.  Consider your tenuki options carefully.

I've heard this move is favorable when W has strength on the right.

I've seen r-7 here for white as well as various pincers.];B[qq]

(;W[pq]C[Ben: I've not seen this move before.  My instinct tells me it works out well for B.]
;B[pp];W[qr]C[Ben: What if B did this instead?]
(;B[oq]
(;W[pr];B[or]C[Ben: This is too easy, r5 again would have been painful for you.]
;W[qo];B[kq];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[od]LB[qj:1][pj:2][oj:3]C[Ben: W gave you a big chance to get back in the game here.

1 for W would be safe (honte)
2 Thick and center-oriented
3 Ambitious/inviting (Amashi strategy)];W[dj];B[dh];W[cn]MA[dj]
C[Ben: This is a good way to help the marked stone and create a shape working for you.]
;B[cp];W[en]C[Ben: Locally you played properly, B ends in gote so this was a success.]
;B[gp]C[Ben: B can't prevent an invasion];W[fi]MA[ci]C[Ben: This is probably not the best place, play at X to settle the shape (but it's not necessary now).]
;B[pl];W[qi]C[Ben: At X would put more pressure on B.];B[qm]

(;W[df]MA[ci]C[Jakob: at this point i felt that my game was running well... her D12 was very weak now, as was her Q8 group. her threat to my lower right corner felt toothless, so i thought that was a mistake of her. 3 corners were my opponents now, but i had some territory on the sides, and my influence towards the middle was good.

but... my D14 turns out to be even weaker then black's D12. how should i have played here locally?

Ben: The middle is quite invadeable by either side yet.  It will be a mutual struggle for points there.

Points wise its still difficult to say, Optimistically W has 15 on the top and left side corner and the right is maybe 10.

B has 20 top right and left for 40 plus the bottom.  

As for a better move its probably still at X.  But the peep was worth consideration.]
;B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[eh];B[de];W[ch];B[ef];W[di];B[eg]C[Ben: Always always tenuki this atari until the end.  To fill here is to make a play worth 1 point even if it is sente for your opponent.]
;W[dh];B[qj];W[fe];B[ee];W[oi]MA[pi]C[Ben: Make the pillar it has less aji.]
;B[pj];W[oj];B[pi];W[nn]CR[qm][pl][pj][pi][qj]MA[ip][iq]C[Ben: This group (marked) is really quite difficult to attack now.  An invasion around X was important.]
;B[ko]C[Ben: Now B handles any invasion with ease.]
(;W[jk]C[Jakob: im not at all sure about this move. it just felt good, but actually i dont even know whether this stone did any good at all.

Ben: Well it doesn't really attack, defend or invade anything.  The only thing it might do make some points in the middle but not many because B is sure to start playing there now (and hopefully strengthing the bottom at the same time for instance:]

(;B[gg]LB[hn:1];W[jh];B[gn];W[im];B[fm];W[lm]SQ[jk][jh]LB[ri:1]
[rh:2][rk:3]C[Ben: The marked moves werent worth much and were probably better left as dame points.  

Perhaps you were thinking to attack but B lives easily with 1, 2, etc.]
;B[ri];W[ol];B[qg];W[pg];B[qh];W[nf]C[Ben:  You played a lot of moves to make a little territory in the middle and B kept pace on the side.

S-14 would have been a little better, your strength on the outside ensures your stones won't die.]
;B[rf];W[hf];B[fd];W[gd];B[ge]MA[hh]C[Ben: At X was simpler for B.]
;W[he];B[gf];W[hg];B[dl]C[Jakob: i thought of playin here for some time, but i felt that i wasnt too urgent because i could kill her stone there. i was wrong]

(;W[em]C[Ben: You should probably avoid this fight.];B[el];W[fl]
;B[gl];W[fk];B[cl];W[bo];B[bp];W[fn];B[gm];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp]
C[Jakob: this just took a liberty from me i guess

Ben: Its a difficult fight for W in any case.];B[fq];W[al];B[bl]
;W[ak];B[bm];W[bn];B[bk];W[bj];B[am];W[aj];B[dn]C[Gummiente [12k\]: hmmmm

Jakob: at this point i tried to read for some time and decided that my group is dead

Ben: Yes, your haven't enough liberties.];W[ho]C[Ben: This is a good move for you.]
;B[go];W[hp]C[Ben: Excellent];B[hq]
(;W[jp]C[Ben: This is passive though.];B[jq];W[kp];B[lp];W[lo]
C[Jakob: i shouldve taken my time to read before i cut here]

(;W[no];B[np];W[mn];B[mp];W[mc];B[hj]C[Jakob: should i have plugged this earlier? i thought about playing here for some time, but decided that i couldnt really stop black from getting into here since she had G13 and G8 available

Ben: Right there arent any important plays here. f-17, k-7  and n-16 or n-18 would have been better.

And for B playing the tactic on k-7 would have probably been more valuable so really you caught a break.]
;W[jm]C[Jakob: good she didnt exploit this weak spot earlier

Ben: True];B[md];W[ld];B[me];W[lf];B[mf];W[mg];B[gi];W[bh];B[bg]
;W[mb]C[Ben: This is a good move in the endgame.];B[nb]C[Ben: You can continue this way.]

;W[os];B[ns];W[ps];B[nr];W[ag]C[Jakob: i played this and immediately thought that this move would be gote...

Ben: It depends as we will see.];B[af];W[ah]C[Ben: A play at X can be avoided if B thinks there is something bigger than about 5 or 6 points. 

Like a monkey jump for instance.]
(;B[be]C[Jakob: ... but she secured there anyway. was that necessary?

Ben: See  variation.];W[da]C[Jakob: i misread here

Ben: Yes I bet you wont forget this one!];B[fc];W[fb];B[ca]
;W[gb];B[ea]C[Ben: Even so p-9 was bigger I think.];W[fa]C[Jakob: that move was horribly small

Ben: Unfortunately yes.];B[fh];W[fj];B[jj];W[kj];B[ji];W[ki]

Jakob: that mistake of not answering M15 cost me dearly, but didnt make any difference at all since i lost by a huge amount. even killing her D8 group would not have saved me.

Ben: Yes of course you are correct however those were simple errors of calculation.  You have very good judgement (you made several tenukis when B played slowly) and these inacuracies will decrease with time and experience.  

Make sure that you experiment more with tenuki and the aji that results in the opening and middlegame.   Don't worry about following a Joseki correctly as much as feeling your way through to finding good shapes.

Remeber that building strength is what allows your attacks later to be successful.  You can't attack if your always off balance, even in a handicap game.  

Avoid those compulsions to play high moves when you think they only "might" do something.  Really think and try to find the right moves.

For inspiration it is helpful (and often entertaining) to follow the games of stronger players and professionals.  Go4go.net/v2 is an excellent source for modern pro games.  Gobase.org also has a large database of older and historical games which are no less instructive.
