C[Hi Sergei,

Thanks for the opportunity to review your game.  I hope my remarks and variations will help you to improve your game.

The main points are: 
- a better understanding of how far to extend stones and finishing a sequence to the end.
- how to build while attacking. (this is how W won the game)
- Read before you play even reading only the first 3 moves will improve your game.
- Look at the whole board an try to fiind the biggest move, then see if its sente and read out at least three moves!
 If you don't know where to play look at where it would be good for your opponent to play that's usually a good place for you to play.

The above mentioned points will come back in the commemts and variations later on.


 If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

Best regards,
Lothar.];B[pd]C[Hello Dear reviewer,

I play Black (JaedongGo) in this game, my opponent is White and recieves 0,5pts komi. We both are listening as 4k / 5k but I think this is a far stretch. At my local go club I have to recieve 8 stones from a 8k. At least I'm basically don't know any "proper" go theory.

I think my biggest problem is that I lose to much against invasions and cannot invade/reduce properly myself. I would appreciate any hint here very much.

Thanks for reviewing and have fun :)];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]
;W[cd]C[I didn't expect this move and I though I answered a little weak.]
;B[ce]C[W C16 after B D15 is very standard and even though you thought reaction to be weak B C15 is the only move to play here. After this W will play F17 and B plays C(D)11.]
;W[fd];B[dh]C[This is too close. Unless w has a stone at C(D)10/9 B will extend 3 spaces from a 2 stone wall.]
;W[nq];B[bd]C[I think this is too small in comparisson to what W can gain in the other corner. See var.]

;W[mc]C[W should extend all the way to O17.]

See vars.]

(;B[ck]C[at this position I tough I was doing well. My right seems as big as Whites bottom and my left bigger as White's top.

I agree ;-) But playing go is in many ways like talking you have to finish your sentences before the other guy does it for you! So keeping sente is essential.

Before playing C9 you should have played C5 yourself. See var.]
;W[co]C[ouch!];B[cn]C[w keeps sente.];W[bn];B[bm];W[bo];B[dl]
C[Bad for black look at those overconcentrated stones! Look again at the previous var. too see difference in outcome and use of your stones.]
;W[qh]C[Now he invades me and I lose pretty much there. What would be the best way to either kill him or at least get some points in return. Or is it impossible?

The invasion is reasonable and W can't be killed. (work it out to see for yourself).
I think it worked out alright because W choses to go up S15 instead of down and destryoing B's moyo.]

(;B[nm]C[........why settle ?  Keep it up with M5! See var]
;W[ok]C[This is another good example. I feel powerless against that.

RULE: when attack don't touch! So If you want to attack P10 is no option. You should cap and unlike the previous invasion W is a long way from home meaning that B is strong in the sense of being able to close of the escape and W is weak in the sense of that is more difficult to make eyes in the center of the board

It's always a bit tricky to read things like this so when you can't read it all out (I couldn't) don't play it. Simply limit the damage by playing Q8 and then attack and build some territory while attacking. Better safe then sorry.]
(;B[oj]C[Here you actually lose the game by allowing W to build while attacking.]

[hl]C[I thought I was already a little behind, That's why i left there a point for invasion. I though if I would try to build up a wall like the Circles and Triangles I would definetly lose because the Center of White would have been to big. But there might be still a better way of doing both (defend and build up influence towards center).

Probably this move was the main reason why I lost.];W[hj];B[hh]

So yes, this was the game. Basically he invaded me succesfully at the right side and reduced my territory on the left side, while I couldn't reduce his center territory enough. That's why I lost I think.
