;B[pd]C[Thank you for reviewing.

I've never played hoshi, so I'm trying to experiment with it. I usually played komoku or mokuhazushi and few variations.

I want to know, whether I'm using my hoshi stones properly and if not, how to utilize its strength. I have also one question about attack at move 91. It's also the last question from me.

Thank you!

Hi! 
I am Karen Ogg, NannyOgg on kgs, 1d AGA. I hope my suggestions will help you to get stronger.]

Hmmnm, I don't agree with this pincer, since black has the hoshi stone in the upper right, the top is not that interesting to you. I would calmly take the left instead.]

;B[pl]C[Now I'm little bit heavy...

So, for black, was it right approach to left side ?

I think black is ok now, he got corner points and W moyo is  still very open, not to mention that D10 is a bit close to White thickness.]

Was it right approach to whole board position ? Should I rather live with my stone by jumping to q18 or n15 ?

White seems very over concentrated now, I would like to move K16 somewhere else.]

I like that move, but I think you could have skipped K16 and get it right away, although N14 wasn't particularly big move for black since sansan is still open in UR]

My questions ends here... After about 70 moves I killed black group and black resigned.


I would like to ask you a counter question. Did you count at this point in the game? If so , are you behind or ahead? You can only decide on strategy like 'I have to kill a black group' if you count first, because if you are ahead, no reason to risk killing. If you are behind, feel free to make a mess ^^

Let's count this board and see how white is doing. 
I see white as 25+9+2+6+komi = 48.5
black 27 + 9 +10 +6+10 + 2 = 64

OK, i guess trying to kill is fine then ^^
But before you kill, i would worry about your M3 group. It is not particularly strong, and could use some strengthening, black could really bugger it while strenghtening his own groups.]
