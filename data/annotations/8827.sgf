C[parcer[8k\] - White
celtic9[10k\] - Black
Komi: 0,5

Although the game info shows me as 9kyu, I' actually a 10kyu player. Anyway, I would like overall commentaries on the game, specially the mid-game and early end-game. I'll comment on the moves I would like more attention.

Thanks!

...

N: Hi, I play as Numsgil (2k) on KGS.  I've prefixed my comments with N to keep them separate from yours.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce]C[I was going to try out the Orthodox fuseki I've seen some videos about...

N: Yes, this is fine.];W[jd];B[ld]TR[op][np][nq][oq]C[N: The top isn't very urgent right now; it's in a state of miai.  Approaching white's corner at the triangles is larger.]
;W[gc];B[ke]TR[jd]C[... but got quite lost around here. I think L15 is too slow, I think I sould have tenuki'ed.

N: Yes, tenuki is appropriate here.  White's corner in the bottom right still beckons.

Also, this diagonal move is usally bad.  If you can remove it from your repitoire you'll do yourself a great service.  The problem is that the marked white stone occupies the shape point you want for your stones.  Once white responds, he'll also be much stronger, while you won't really be any stronger at all.

Rule of thumb here: this sort of diagonal move is only a good idea if you see a way to entirely enclose the stones or if you're attempting to prevent a white slide along the edge (to prevent white from making a base).  Otherwise white always gets more from the exchange than black.  In this case, white profits by making a stronger group and you gain only modest outside strength.]
;W[je]C[N: White says "thankyou"];B[kf]C[N: Just tenuki.  These stones aren't in danger and, while you're building some influence that could be useful, taking gote to do it is too painful.]
;W[kc]C[N: White is needlessly concerned about a base.  You could tenuki here.  I'd say white's 3-4 corner is still bigger.]
;B[lc]C[N: But responding isn't a terrible idea either.];W[lb]
;B[mb];W[kb];B[nc]C[N: You should just tenuki here.  Normally you need this stone to make shape and have a strong wall, but in this case, since you already have the 4-4 stone, white doesn't have a super strong attack.  Later, early in the midgame, this might become an important point.  But right now white's bottom right corner is bigger.]
;W[jp];B[op]TR[pn][pm][qm][qn]C[So, I thoust from where should I approach this San-ren-sei structure. I though about coming from above at C6, but I thought it would reinforce it. Any suggestions?

N: You've invested a large number of stones in the upper right to make a strong position.  Although it's unusual, you might consider any of the triangles in order to make a large moyo.  White will probably defend, and you can finish the position with another stone and have a formidable moyo.]
;W[oq]
(;B[nq]C[N: Try this different joseki (see variation).  The problem here is that you're not going to build a base in this direction.]
;W[pq];B[no];W[pn];B[pj]C[N: Feels pretty awkward, right?  A good indication that you chose the wrong joseki for the last few moves.]
;W[nm];B[ln]C[N: Now you're running with a heavy group.];W[ll]
;B[jn];W[gp];B[kp];W[kq];B[lp];W[lq];B[mq];W[iq];B[jo];W[cj]
C[I guess the results are much better for white: I have an almost enclosed groups in the lower side, and white has taken C10...

N: Yes. much better for white than black.];B[cq]C[...which made think that invadin would be a good idea. My mistake...

N: No, this is okay.];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gr]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]C[...because now white's wall works very nicely with C10 and I can just hope to reduce a little of his influence later. Which course of action would've been better? I thought in the review that goig for something like C7 instead of invading at 3x3 would at least not help him reinforce.

N: But you got sente from the whole thing.  And you've got a good 10 points from a corner that white was claiming before.  And white is really overconcentrated on the bottom side (all those stones and he has all of maybe 10 points on the bottom (not counting the other corner).  The timing of this invasion was okay for black.]
(;B[on]C[So, unsatisfied with the result, I went to attack white' stones.

N: This isn't an attack.  This says "I'm concerned about my stones and want to ensure two eyes by thrashing a bit".

If you want to attack, see the variation for the preferrerable method.]
;W[om];B[pm]C[N: This cut isn't really useful, because you can't really connect out to either side.]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[ql];B[qo]C[I think i just got it because my opponent didn't play the right move. He would like to know how he sould have player this sequence to avoid getting killed later.

N: Your oppoent played fine; the cut wasn't good.];W[po]TR[qn]
C[N: This is over-reaching, though.  There's too many cutting points for white to play this aggressively.  Black is asking for gote to make some points.  White should just let him.  If white just defends solidly at triangle black won't have accomplished anything except making white's central group super strong.]
;B[pp]C[N: This is good for black.  He's creating cutting points, and white can't defend them all.]
;W[qn]TR[qq]C[N: White says he's okay with black taking the corner by not defending the cut at triangle.]
;B[ro]TR[qq]C[N: Black should probably just cut right away at triangle.  This seems to give white too much leeway.]
;W[rp]C[N: White can now both defend the corner and protect his central stones.]
;B[rm]C[N: Black says he wants to prevent the central white stones from having a base, and is okay with white taking the corner.]
;W[rn];B[qq]C[N: Black has changed his mind and says he wants the corner.]
;W[qr]TR[rq]C[N: White can't decide what he wants and tries to get everything.  Simply descending with triangle would be better.  White has sufficient compensation by being allowed to capture 5 black stones.]
;B[rq];W[so];B[rr]C[I thought I had won th lower left corner a little of the lower side, but I wasn' so sure about the death of the P3 stone groups. But they seem quite dead right now.

N: Black occupies the 2-2 point, which usually gives the advantage to corner battles like this.  White's 3 stones aren't going to live.]
;W[oi]TR[ph]SQ[ch]C[The shoulder hit required immediate attention.

N: The problem is that white is undercutting any territory you could try to build along the side.  Better to treat this stone lightly and play at triangle, or just tenuki and take the last biggish point at square.]
;B[pi]C[Should I have gone to the center with O10?];W[oh];B[qg]
TR[pj][pi]C[N: Notice that black's territory is undercut, and the two marked black stones aren't actually doing anything productive.]
;W[cg]C[N: Now white gets this point :(];B[df]TR[bf]C[N: Diagonal move, again.  Same issues as last time, so it's bad.  Notice that the other diagonal move is an endgame double-sente point.  It's okay in that case because it's threatening white territory and preventing white from doing the same.]
;W[dg]C[N: White doesn't mind stretching up and building a deeper moyo.]
;B[eg]TR[ej]C[N: This will end in gote if you defend the stone, and if you don't, what was the point?  If you're worried about white's bit of moyo, play a reduction move, like triangle for instance.]
;W[eh];B[ff];W[fh]TR[bf]C[N: White should probably tenuki and play things like triangle, for instance.  This isn't a bad move, since it make the moyo deeper, but this isn't the time to lose sente.]
;B[ip];W[jq];B[hp];W[ho];B[io];W[hn]C[Here I knew my previous moves weren't as good as I thought, and a white was surrounding a big area.

N: Black can cause some trouble if he follows through with the threat that white didn't protect.  See variation.]
(;B[gk]TR[hj][hk]C[So, I decided to reduce... But the stone seems so lonely there now; I should have been more careful. How should I have played after allowing white the last moves? Also, parcer would like some tips on how to enclose his territory here better - although I think he did a great job stopping my reduction.

N: Reducing is fine if you don't see the kill at the bottom.  And this is a fine way of reducing, but if you're afraid, you can make it a shallower reduction by playing at triangles instead.]
;W[hj];B[hk];W[ij]
(;B[il]TR[jl]C[N: Triangle is better (lighter).  The thing is you don't care about these stones.  You only care that white gets reduced.]
;W[im];B[jl]C[N: Now black is convicted to make life for all of these stones, because he played solidly (and therefore heavily).]
;W[jm];B[km];W[kl];B[hm];W[in];B[gn];W[go];B[fm];W[fn];B[gm]
;W[em];B[en];W[fo];B[el];W[dm];B[ej];W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[fi]
;W[ei];B[gi];W[ek];B[dk];W[dj];B[fl];W[ej];B[hh]C[And I thought I was able to scape after such but moves inside white territory...]
;W[ig];B[gg];W[gh];B[hi];W[hg]
(;B[jj]C[I thought I could squeeze white here, but my reading was really too optimistic (in another words, bad). Any suggestions around here, to save the enclosed group?

N: This "nose tesuji" is sometimes the right move, but not in this case.  See variations.]
;W[ii];B[ih];W[ji];B[kj]TR[jh]C[N: No, you don't care about this stone, do you?  Sacrifice it to escape with your main group.  Play at triangle.]
;W[ki];B[lj]C[N: You still don't care about these stones, but you insist on saving them.  Which gives white time to build up strength to attack your main group.]
;W[jg];B[jh];W[kh];B[kg];W[mh]C[And white scapes. I was already without hope of capturing him here, but I thought I could take the chance to save my single-eyed group.]
;B[jf]C[First attempt: try to capture some white stones up here. I wasn't able to read the capture clearly, though, and played a little mindlessly. Problem: my stones were very loose here, and he attacked me easily.]
;W[gf];B[fg];W[he]
(;B[if]C[N: Do you honestly expect your opponent to fail to connect?  If not, don't play these sorts of mvoes, even if you think you're losing.]
;W[hf];B[ie];W[fe];B[ef];W[hd];B[id]C[N: You're sort of forgetting about the main attraction and getting distracted.]
;W[ic];B[kd];W[mi]C[N: White says, fine, you get a few points.  Is that really what you wanted?]
;B[jk];W[nk];B[ml]C[Second attempt: cut here. Bad stone connection again.]
;W[mk];B[mm];W[lm];B[mn];W[kn];B[ko];W[km];B[lk];W[mj];B[ol]
C[But! I wasn't giving up so easily. I would at least try to make white' center group disconnected.]
;W[ok]C[And he helped me here in a way I didn' think he would. He blocked here...]
;B[nl]C[... and I connected, saving my lone three stone group at P7. Now his corner seemed dead to me, and the game seemed more balanced again.

N: nuh-uh.  See variation.]
(;W[pk];B[oo]
(;W[jc];B[or]C[As I said, I wasn' sure about the stones death... I think I should have played anywhere at the upper corners this time.

N: This would be fine if you were well in the lead.  But you're down by 15+ points.  You don't have time to play like this.]
;W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[sj];B[si];W[be];B[bd];W[bf];B[cf]
C[Argh! Bad, bad move! Why not simply connect at C16, I think now. White got an upper hand...

N: This is a good example of filling your own liberties.];W[bc]
C[...with this clamp. How should I have dealed with it, after making those ugly mistakes before?

N: You probably have to sacrifice your large clump of stones.]
(;B[ad];W[cc];B[cd];W[db]
(;B[ec]C[N: You won't even get two eyes this way.  You have to play desperately and double hane.]
;W[eb];B[ee];W[fd];B[fc];W[fb];B[ac];W[ed];B[dd];W[bg];B[bb]
;W[cb]C[I don' know why I insisted... The corner seemed lost to me before I gave up. Any directions of play that could have helped me?]
;B[sm];W[rl];B[hq]C[N: Good, kill these stones.];W[hr];B[gq]
;W[eo];B[lr];W[kr];B[mr];W[fs];B[ds];W[is];B[gs];W[dl];B[es]
C[Well, at least I got the lower side. But the cost was too high, and the game was already lost. This move seems useless now, as the group was already dead. I should have played in the upper left for the sake of some points, as the game was already won by white.

N: This last move here is unnecessary.];W[of];B[pf];W[oe];B[pe]
