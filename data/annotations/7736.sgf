C[Heya,

first of all: thanks for reviewing. I played black (cime) in this game and lost by 8.5 points. I went through the whole game and wrote some thoughts. If you don't mind, could you also comment on these, because I think this could help me to improve my understanding of go.
Could you pay special attention to the opening, because here it is very hard for me see my mistakes by myself?
And maybe you coudl point out just some general mistakes or misconcepts you realized in my play.
Of course, if you see anything, where I played really wrong and I was just lucky that my opponent didn't see it, it would be nice if you can tell me that.

thank you very much

Hi there,

My name is Dieter. I am a 2 dan in Belgium but currently only play on DGS. My comments will be preceded by dv:

Enjoy the review];B[pd]C[dv: One of the main messages I always seem to bring when reviewing is that, although the opening is important, interesting and a field for developing your ideas about Go, it is mostly not the differentiator for winning or losing. When I was still playing competition and approaching 3d-4d level, I started getting the feeling that just playing well overall was not sufficient anymore and I really had to think about the opening. Now that I'm back at 2d and playing 1k-1d people, I make a major difference in the middle game.

Thinking about the opening now is definitely fruitful, but do not expect spectacular impact on your winning percentage from major improvement in the opening. Since you asked for special attention to it, I'll discuss the opening, but I reserve the right to draw your attention to where I thought it really mattered.]
;W[qp];B[cd];W[dp];B[op];W[mq]C[I actually wasn't sure whether to play the Joseki which followed, because it is quite complicated and I don't 100% understand it. Which other posibilities would have been there. I decided to play it because of q16 and i roughly knew what would happen.

dv: I suggest not to focus too much on "the joseki" but focus on the general purpose of the moves. If you know what you are trying to accomplish, then your minor tactical mistakes and deviations from "the joseki" cost only a few points. So here I'd say: "White wants to create an advantage at the lower side, while removing the base of the black stone" rather than trying to picture the end result of the joseki. Only if you really master all the variations of the joseki, you can do so, because any deviation by the opponent you will take to your advantage.]
;B[qq]C[dv: the attachment is a special measure to quickly settle the stones, at the expense at more opponent strength]
;W[pq]C[dv: Here White's idea is to "cut the opponent where you are strong"]
;B[pp]C[dv: Obviously, Black cuts back.];W[oq]C[dv: Here I leave it to you to think about what this move tries to do and if there are other options.]
;B[nq]C[dv: This move is very very elaborate and I suspect most people don't know the meaning of it. With all the ataris involved here, this is a dangerous joseki, where going astray can lead to disaster.]
;W[np];B[nr];W[qr];B[rq];W[or];B[qo]
(;W[mp]TR[kr]C[I wasn't sure, how to answer here. I played p6, because it seemed like a nice form and o5 is now not necessar anymore.
Is this result actually reasonable for white? because I got l2 later.

I think the Joseki is with w n2 b o5 w n4 (see variation). Is this correct an why should white play like this and give up sente?

---------
dv: 

The aji you show (triangle) is a good suggestion of the weakness left by White, deviating from the joseki. But the real drawback is elsewhere. See variations.]
(;B[on]LB[rr:A]C[I actually liked this result here, even though w got sente.

dv: Not quite. White has sente and can now play the big move at A.]
;W[ed];B[df]C[dv: This is a simple choice of joseki. Black chooses to develop along the right side, putting some pressure on the White stone. This is how I think about such moves.]
;W[cc]C[dv: Again, the attachment is a special move. It tries to force a sequence where both sides become strong, like when two young scums stand nose to nose, pumping up their testosterone, before realizing they don't really want to fight, having measured up the other one's strength.]
;B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[ic]C[was this reasonable for black?

dv: it is certainly reasonable. I cannot tell the best choice of joseki with confidence, but my feeling is that Black's best choice wouldbe to have pincered, to build a big moyo. Now White is neutralizing this area.]
(;B[cn]C[dv: though the book may say something else, I like this move. It is good on a basic level.]
;W[fp];B[dj];W[nc]LB[kc:A][ie:B][ne:C]C[dv: continuing on the real point of the "book's move", now Black would probably not play A, and White would certainly not respond B but rather C. That is why I can understand Black should force on a large scale with A first, followed by White B, then Black can take time to tackle the lower left.

Again, while this may matter at 4d level, I don't think the difference matters a lot right now, but it never harms to try and understand.]
;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ld];B[qj]LB[qi:C][cq:B][rr:A]SQ[on]C[Is this one too slow?

(I don't really get the concept of being slow or not (never heard somebody saying fast^^). Maybe you could tell me why or why not.)

dv: It is not as much slow as it is close to thickness. The big, almost double sente move at A has been blinking for some time now. A "fast" move, which means "developing on a large scale without too much care about safety, or even disputing areas where the other would seem to have the right to go", would be B

Your choice of which area is important, seems all right, but given the thickness of the marked stone, I'd prefer to play at C and strengthen the upper right corner.]
;W[dh]
(;B[fj]C[actually when I think about it now, I guess, this was the first huge mistake i made. (At least as far as I can see it.)
I actually didn't see, he could pla e14.

dv: See variation];W[ef];B[eg];W[dg];B[ee]
(;W[ff];B[fe];W[de];B[cf];W[ge];B[fh];W[bp]TR[ee][fe]SQ[dg]
[dh]C[I think I got out quite okai, even though. Could white have played in a better way?

dv: the squared stones still have a lot of aji, meaning there not captured cleanly, while the triangled stones are firmly caught in a ladder, with hardly any ladder breaker for Black to benefit from. B4 is also very big. White is playing solidly to keep the advantage.]
;B[dl]LB[oj:A]C[It feels like this one is too slow, but on the other side I thought I need to play there. My stones were way too loose and the aji of the d12 stones would have been bad.

dv: I appreciate the fact that you appreciate the aji of these stones, but I agree it is too slow. White A can now erase the right side and White will have the advantage. On top of that, the aji is still in the D12 stones.]
;W[pg];B[qg]
(;W[of]C[dv: Here White goes astray];B[ph];W[og];B[qf]C[dv: the territorial insurance by Black is not equalled by White's extra influence.]
;W[bb]C[dv: this exploits the aji of D12 nicely];B[bh];W[mm]
;B[kr]LB[rr:A]C[Is this invasion correct? He answered even better (for me) than I thought, but is it really resonable?

I think he has to play on the right side, there is too much aji, isn't it? (see variation)

------------

dv: This is a very nice counterattack, exploiting the fact that White has still not played at A. You correctly feel you are behind, you correctly decide you should play aggressively and you spotted a weakness to exploit. Very good thinking!]
(;W[mr];B[hq];W[fr];B[ho];W[jp]LB[hq:3][fr:4][kr:1][mr:2]C[here I wasn't sure how to play, but I thought k3 gives me the best shape.

dv: The best way to think about that stone is that 1-2 and 3-4 have already served a purpose. White has responded submissively in his sphere of influence (although 2 also took away the sente of S2). Black has easily put some stones here, and now you only need to make sure these come not under a large scale attack.]
(;B[jq]C[dv: See variation.];W[ip];B[gq]
(;W[go];B[kp];W[hp];B[gp];W[hn];B[fo]C[I played this one, because I think it was more worth to live inside and reduce his corner a bit, than to run with only one eye and risk something worse.]
;W[io];B[fq];W[ep]
(;B[eq];W[dq];B[er];W[dr];B[fs];W[ol]
(;B[oj]C[Here I didn't want to give him a huge center. And I saw already that I could break through around p15 with that (see a little further on).

dv: I don't think it is a matter of a huge center, but I agree with your comment in the variation. This jump breaks his connectivity on a large scale and therefore I think it is good.]
;W[ql]
(;B[hh]C[dv: This move is a bit vague to my taste. I suggest a few variations.]
;W[if]LB[od:B][mk:C][bn:A][rr:D]C[correct timing?

dv: this is a small increase. I think both players are telling each other that the centre is big, while it is small. I prefer the moves A-D with C as a favorite.]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[oc];W[ob];B[nf];W[nd];B[ng];W[pc];B[qb]C[dv: Good!]

dv: not ouch. This is small.];B[rd];W[pe]
(;B[of]LB[ab:E][nl:A][mn:B][bo:C][rr:D]C[ouch again ... the first mistake made me kind of confused, so I made another one (:

and s18 does work now, so it was reall big

dv: defenses here are very small now. harassing the stones with A and B is much bigger. And even endgame like C/D/E are bigger. S18 is also endgame but not too big.]
;W[mk]LB[ab:C][rk:E][bn:B][kn:D][rr:A]C[dv: A great move this is. Now the endgame is near. I already identified the big moves A-C. D is big now too, and has some middle game flavour. And E is also big, although White must be careful with that group.

I'll judge your success in the endgame from how many of these moves you got.]
;B[bo]C[dv: Great start!];W[co];B[bn];W[rk];B[rj];W[rr];B[rp]
;W[pn]
(;B[qn]C[I think this one wasn't good, but I wasn't sure, whether I would live with s6, and here I could read it. Are the variations correct?]
;W[pm];B[po];W[sj]
(;B[ab]LB[ab:B][rk:E][kn:C][bo:A][rr:D]C[Here I was actually kinda scared, that something like in the variation might happen, so i just ignored it (:
I thought I probably get enough compensation, even if he plays t12 (what he did).

dv: It is very good endgame fighting spirit, to play tenuki. You got A and B, he got D and E. So I hope that next you'll get C, to cut up his forces and destroy the central potential.]
;W[sh];B[ri];W[si]
(;B[rg]C[See var.];W[ko]LB[cb:A][nc:1]TR[ol][ql][mm]SQ[ee][fe]
[dg][dh]C[dv: Alas, you took gote on the right side, allowing White to take this big point. Even if the big endgame follow up at A is now for you, White's extra potential here and the extra thickness for his stones sets the game out of reach for White, so I will wrap up the commentary here.

1. In the opening, you may have suffered a small loss, by allowing White 1. But that is certainly not where the game was lost.
2. In the middle game, the exchange of the squared stones was not to your advantage.  White's territory at the top appeared naturally, while yours had bad aji. Simply cutting off his stones on a large scale would have been better.
3. In the late middle game, there were opportunities to cut off the triangled stones. Black could have fought back there and not let these stones ruin the right side territory AND become stable.]

And if white gets then an extension on the left, it works nice with his strength around n3.

Are my thoughts correct? Because that was the reason to play c6 instead.

dv: the point is that this area is urgent, while the C6 area is merely big. Black should not be preoccupied with the L17 stone, which can be considered to be forcing in a broad sense.

But now we're getting into the borders of my knowledge and understanding, really elaborate opening stuff, where later on, blatant mistakes will happen.]
