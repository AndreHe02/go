Hi This is Sen (about 3-5k depending on which server :) )
Hope I can give you some good overview.];W[qf]C[viderblool [14k\]: hello]
;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc]C[This is the right sequence to a joseki the next move for white to complete the sequence is at R11 (W) and K17 (B)
But that will give black more advantage to form a more solid structure up there. That is why W chose to play else where.]

(;B[pq]TR[np]C[P4 would have been joseki, but I don't know this sequence well
enough and misplayed.  P4 would have been a better move.

Yes this is a small move. By this move you are sacrificing the mark stone as it become isolated. 
There is no way u can handle so many separated groups.
Better to keep you groups joined and remain strong in the center.]

The marked stones form a solid influence outside though W has a considerable gain at the corner but the central influence hass much greater potential in making more points.

play one of the squares for good shape on the side.  Did I leave
the fight in the lower right corner too soon, though?  Should I
have played this stone elsewhere to accomplish what I wanted?

When you want to put pressure there is 2 motive.
1) To kill off the group
2) To make territory while forcing the group to move.
Here you cant achieve either 
1) The group can easily escape to middle and make alive
2) There is a weakness at the triangle mark
You cant make territory at the right side.
Anyway the right side territor is too squeezed....
You should considering the central instead.]N[Position];W[of]

You attack one way then change direction suddenly.
If you have decide to force the group to go out then continue it.

side that I was trying to win by playing stone 24... Could I have
handled this better?

and K10, as well as putting pressure on the right side W group.
Was this well played though?  Or is this too early in the game?
Would I have been better off securing one of the two unplayed
corners?

You are right. There is a big exposed area in the middle you might as well protect those black region where white has not invaded yet
Take the initiative instead of reacting.]N[??];W[fc]C[Here W invades
He chose this direction is to limit what you can gain from the influence]

Nothing much you can do about it.

Well practise L&D diligently until you can identify by just one look.

With that I shall summarise
1) Alway have a big overview how you are going to play. Like grand plan.
See your surrounding seeds and how to make use of them to form a big framework.

2) When you attack always remember 
a) Never touch the group you are attacking
b) Attack to kill (risky) or attack to gain territory in the process (easier)
if it's the latter then you have to think how to make territory.
The area which has more potential so you should the enemy toward the other area which has less potential.

3) Practise lots of Life and Death of groups
until it becomes 2nd nature.

4) Always keep your groups together. too many sparse groups == weak group and liable to be attacked and killed.
Keep them together (linked) and you have a strong group and can make use of them to kill other groups

5) Before you attack your own groups must be strong 1st.
No point try to kill a group when your groups are weaker than them...
Always reinforce your own group 1st before attacking.

I hope this review is good for you
