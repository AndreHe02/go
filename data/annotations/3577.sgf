C[Ioana: This game was played in the last round of a tournament.
That's why I've got white though I only play 11kyu and Danny
plays 9kyu.

Danny: The tournament was held in cologne (germany) and i learned
two things there:
1. Drinking Koelsch (a special beer brewed in cologne) gives
me bad headaches the next morning.
2. Playing go with headaches makes me at least two stones weaker
;-)

Kokorini: Hello, I will make the review of this game. I just quicky see it and the first think I think I in the proverb: "urgent before big". You will see. enjoy it and ask me any questions, please, I will be glad o answer it.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[ci];W[jc];B[jp];W[qf]C[Kokorini: this move is not bad. But I feel it a little close from the corner.]
;B[nq];W[qm];B[hc];W[je]C[Ioana: I felt this move was necessary to prevent a black pincer
at M17 or N17, even though I feared to lose the opportunity of
an invasion.

Kokorini: I think this move is ok, is somehow pretinding to make a moyo in the upper right corner. But is very vulnerable right now, and black is making a lot of influence in that left.
I think lower left corner is probably the best are for white to think about.]
;B[he]
(;W[cm]LB[ei:A]C[Ioana: Still I am not sure, if this was the best point for an
invasion. I suppose it doesn't really matter if this stone was
at G3 or C14 instead. Black just seems to get territory in the
other two places. Where do you think is the best point?

Kokorini:I think that is important to see the consecuences of this move. if black Play at A (E11) white will have problems.

We can consider an invasion at 3-3 point, it is sente. but.... see var for this move.

So I understand that the question is where is the best point for Black now?

I think it is at A.];B[co];W[gp]C[K: white is making another weak group before the first one have some base.]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[jq];W[gm];B[dm]LB[em:A]C[K: i like the idea of Black but I think that is better at A.]
;W[ck];B[dl];W[dj];B[di];W[ej]LB[cl:A]C[A point can not be forget. Take care.]
;B[pr]C[Danny: I was not sure if i could directly jump onto R3. So i
played the "safe" way.

K: I think is OK. But the other fight is not over!];W[qq];B[qj]
C[Danny: At this point, i wanted to prevent white to get the whole
right side.

K: good, but if you get stronger attacking some of the other white groups is invasion will be easyer.]
;W[qh];B[oj];W[nh];B[kd]LB[qj:A][pm:B]C[Ioana: Somehow I admire this move, going as close as possible
for an invasion. As I already was short with (potential) territory
before this black invasion, I decided to play all-or-nothing
fighting it down.

Danny: I was afraid that white would build a huge framework in
the upper left corner, so i decided to do something against it.
As i'm not good at invasions, i played this kikashi first to
gain some backup for the invasion.

Kokorini: ok. but A group is very weak. if you fight inside you will make stronger outside, where live your other weak group. I think a move at B first is better.]

;W[nb];B[mc]C[Danny: As i said. I'm not good at invasions. In one of the previous
games, one of my invasions where completly shut in and killed.
So i wanted to make sure, i got some way out this time and played
this stone as a sacrifice stone to gain enough momentum for my
escape.];W[mb];B[lg]LB[pe:A];W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[lc];B[pe]
;W[qd]C[Ioana: It didn't work out too well...];B[og]C[K: I think black has to be happy, and white have to answer it.]
;W[cd]C[Ioana: This move seems too risky. I really was surprised to be
successful with the invasion. In the lower left corner there's
even less space for an invasion. What else could I have done
to catch up?

Danny: Isn't that the same as an 3-3 invasion when i had a stone
on the starpoint?

Ioana: Not if you played the next move at C17...];B[dd];W[cc]

;B[jj]C[Danny: I thought the score was very close.
I was afraid of white playing this move, so i blindly followed
the proverb "Your opponents best move is your best move".

Obviously it was a bit to greedy, wasn't it?

Kokorini: I think it is ok. maybe a little greedy, but just a little.]

C[Kokorini: S14 is urgent!]
(;B[ok]
(;W[ll]C[Ioana: Any other move must be larger than this one... S2, B10,
J2, H6, J18... I think I was afraid black would separate the
O8 stone and take more territory around N9.

Danny: Yep. Exactly the move i didn't want to see ;-)

Kokorini: How can Black capture that stone? see var.];B[rq]
;W[rp];B[pq];W[qp];B[rr]C[K: there are bigger sente moves];W[ib]

;W[gi]C[From here on I didn't record the game since I entered byoyomi-periode.
The result however was black: 53 - white: 57+5.5
The "Guess Result"-Option of CGoban predicts: w+9.5 so the rest
of endgame can't have been so bad on both sides. Or it was equally
bad on both sides of course ;o)

Kokorini: as I say before the first move: "urgent is before big" (Simple becouse it is usually bigger)

The problem is to kwon when something is urgent. But (for both players) before make an invasion try to look "What will happend if I'm success". Dont forget you other stones around.

Black influence on the left in HUGE! so...
before is too late it looks good to play around A (E11). 
But it is very easy to see the fact that a white stone there will make land for black... It is just what black want: Use his wall for attack a week white group.]
