DT[1996-12-13]TM[60]KM[0.5];B[pd]C[General comments:  I see you were playing on a pretty short clock.  The game is good.  Both sides kept all of their groups secure, which is good.]
;W[dq];B[pp];W[dc];B[ci];W[ce];B[cl];W[co];B[jq];W[nq]LB[hq:A][jd:B][pj:C]
C[I'm not at all certain this move is bad, but I would have been more inclined to move at a, b or c.  With your move, you are starting a fight where black is strongest and black  can now profit in the corner while attacking you.  The black stone in the bottom will be difficult to counter-attack.  a and b are both very good extensions from the corner enclosures.]
;B[pq];W[no];B[qn];W[lp]LB[hq:A]C[moving at a would be a better way to attack the black stone in the bottom as it is also an extension from the corner enclosure.  Take profit while attacking.]
;B[gq]C[
Black is secure in the lower left and white's corner in the lower left has gotten small.  White's stones in the lower right are still without a base and attackable.]
;W[fq]C[making contact tends to settle both groups.  This will probably help black and further weaken the white stones on the right. The top of the board desparately needs a white stone.]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[jc]C[very good move for black.];W[ir]LB[pj:A]C[A black stone around a will make black's moyo huge.  Even if this white attack succeeds in taking away black's base, the black group can easily run into the center and live.  A successful attack usually ends in gote, still giving black the right side, which is very big.]
;B[hr]C[For black, I would have played on the other side of the white stone, nearer the weaker group of white stones.  The corner is strong, so no real harm in making it stronger.  The three white stones on the right are still weak, so it's a shame to make them a base.]
;W[jr];B[iq];W[kq];B[is];W[kr];B[fr];W[er];B[gn]C[good move.];W[jo]C[I don't really see what this move does.  White's group now is secure for the immediate future, which is good.  Black's group has escaped into the center and cannot be attacked.  The right side of the board really needs to be broken up.]
;B[fo]LB[pi:A]C[black's group doesn't need defending.  I would have moved around a now.]
;W[eo];B[en];W[do];B[gc]C[This is also good as it takes away white's natural extension.  I still favor a move on the right side for black though.  Black's first two moves were on 4-4 points which emphasize influence and large moyos over taking territory.  Playing on the 3rd line along the top is a bit inconsistent with that.  Still, no question this is a big point to play.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[ch];B[bh]LB[cg:A];W[bg]LB[cg:A]C[Obviously drawing back at a would have worked better.]
;B[cg];W[dh];B[bf];W[dg]LB[cf:A]C[black next at a might have been difficult to handle.]
;B[ag];W[cf];B[bg];W[di];B[cj];W[dj];B[dk];W[be];B[gf]C[black's moyo is getting really huge.  Still playing on the right is bigger.  Generally, corners first, then sides, then center.  Black is also playing kind of close to white's thick wall on the left.]
;W[ff];B[mc]LB[pi:A]C[both sides really have needed to play around a for most of the game.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[This is the right way to block.];W[qd];B[qe];W[re]C[Var 2 is the more usual joseki here and is better for black than the one chosen.]

(;B[rf];W[qf];B[pe];W[rg];B[rd]C[this is joseki and this variation seems good for white this time.  Black takes the corner and white gets a secure base on the side.  The two black stones on the top are dead.]
