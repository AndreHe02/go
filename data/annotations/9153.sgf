AB[dd][pp]C[Hi, there are mainly 2 things I would like you to go over:

- How I handled W29, I think my line of play wasn't correct.
- How I handled the invasion at W67, at the end I succeded but I feel I didn't respond properly to the invasion.

Of course any other suggestions and mistakes from my play I would like that you can point out would be much appreciated.

Kind regards,
William];W[dp]C[Hello, My user on kgs is Greenbean and I will be reviewing your game. I will be glad to respond to any questions you have on kgs aswell as here.]
;B[pc];W[fc];B[cf];W[qn];B[nq];W[qe]C[here I would n17 the reason being is black isn't making anything by attacking whites side around r13 area.
I would rather make a strong shape we can tenuki from around n17 area. Also n17 helps with the attack on f17 later on in the game.


~If you wish to pincer then r13 is better in this case more sever and doesn't give white much wiggle room.

~p17 is also another move to consider if you don't mind losing a bit of influence for a tenuki.

~ The double tenuki of white not playing back should cost him later in the game you have a right to play a slower move here to attack later.]

(;B[qh]C[I would double pincer you here helping f17 not sure why white didn't.]

(;W[qk];B[pe]C[You should not look at his points so much instead look at what you can make.

;B[pd];W[qc]C[This is a terrible result for you and should end in gote with you playing around L16.]
;B[cn];W[ck]C[A double pincer here would favor you @ f4

What is c6 jumping two? The air? One should not send troops into battle without reinforcements!

~ run thru some of my trails to get a better understanding of fuseki.]

(;B[ek]C[This move is an old joseki that is about 20 years old developed in japan. First off lets say its not a joseki here. Joseki leaves the board even this favors white.  The whole idea of e9 is center influence but you have nothing to go to in the center all your points are on the sides.]
