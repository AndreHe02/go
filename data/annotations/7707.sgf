C[oryzae [4k\]: hi
usagi5 [5k\]: hi!

I played this game on February 13, 2010.

Jay: Hi, Andrew. I am glad to help. I take it that this is a handy game with 0.5 Komi. Then, B has some advantage to hold on to at the beginning. I will comment mostly for B.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dp];B[cn];W[fq];B[jd]C[Here I try an opening I have seen Takemiya Masaki play. I have tried before, and I like the result.

Jay: Moyo game invite large scale fighting, sometime hard to control. But, if this is your style why not use it.]
;W[cl];B[cp]C[Should I have jumped out? For some reason, I thought B4 wouldn't be enough. This move led to trouble.

Jay: This is acceptable, and can settle the group. B can also tenuki to be consistent with the moyo game plan. Settle here now may lead breaking up the moyo on top.]
;W[do];B[bn]C[Would connecting have been good?

Jay: Yes, this is not correct. connection is correct.];W[em]
(;B[dm]C[Jay: Such move is aji kashi. C3 decend is a must.]
;W[dl];B[kq]C[I was worried about the moyo white was getting, so I tenukied. I guess I should have played at C3 instead.

Jay: Yes, this is exactly what I mentioned earlier.];W[co]C[As I expected, white pushes through.]
;B[bp]C[Maybe I should played B5. Then wC3, bB4, w B3, then I still have to run. But I would have an eye.]
;W[bo];B[ao];W[cq];B[bq];W[cr];B[br];W[ap];B[an];W[bs];B[aq]
;W[en]C[I'd have been dead if white had played B8. Was the C4 attaching move what lost it?]
;B[bk]C[Desperate, I run out as fast as I can.];W[bl];B[al]
;W[cj]C[Jay: These moves are painful. Game almost lost.];B[bj]
;W[ak];B[aj];W[ci];B[bg];W[bi];B[ai];W[ah];B[bh];W[cf];B[bf]
C[I think I should have played B15.

Jay: Doesn't matter, Insisting saving a few stones only make things worse. This is crawling on 2nd line.]
;W[ce];B[bd];W[be];B[ae];W[cd];B[cc];W[af];B[ag];W[bc];B[ad]
;W[ac];B[af];W[cg];B[bb];W[ch]C[Wouldn't white have wanted to play D17 first? 

Jay: Yes, but this result is still not good for B.];B[ab];W[mq]
;B[hq];W[qf];B[qh];W[qc];B[pc]C[I try to build a wall facing my moyo.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[og];W[gc]C[White invades.];B[gd]C[I cover with G16, thinking that if I don't kill white, I will at least get a good wall.

Jay: This gives W a chance to settle or come out. Direct contact is rarely a good idea under the situation.]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[dc];B[fc];W[fb];B[fd];W[cb];B[bc];W[db];B[gb]
;W[ea];B[ga];W[fa];B[hc]C[I presume that this was the only move. I live in exchange for white's life.]
;W[ca];B[ba]C[Jay: W's plan failed, and only settled small. You are lucky.]
;W[ir]C[Now white steals my base. How should I respond?

Jay: Your response is ok. no choice here.];B[iq];W[jr];B[kr]
C[Is this correct? I was thinking about later playing at P3.]
;W[hr];B[gq];W[gr];B[oq];W[jq];B[io]C[Is this correct?

Jay: Running is not good. When you played p3, you are ready to give up H3 group, and turn around to right lower corner, which is not a bad idea. This move makes H2 group a big target.]
(;W[kp];B[jp];W[lp];B[pp]C[I try to press down on the white stone.

Jay: W missed the key point earlier. But, B started a fight here now is not a good idea either. This will result in two weak groups with W N3 splitting them.]
(;W[qo]C[Jay: This w's move is a bit slack. R3 move severe.]
;B[qq]C[I take the corner.];W[ql];B[ij]C[I decided this move was the biggest. It supported my upper moyo, supported my lover J5 stones, and destroyed some of white's potential territory with his moyo.

Jay: Not sure this covers all the basis. It is too far from J3 group. And two far to prevent an invasion on the top. N12, J14, are two good invasion points.]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[rr]
(;B[pm]C[Jay: This jump a too far.];W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[no]
;W[om];B[pl];W[mm];B[mn]
(;W[ln]C[Jay: This hane is not correct. W should L6 jump the split B.]
;B[lm];W[mo];B[nn];W[nm];B[nr];W[mr];B[pr]C[Did I play this fight out to the best result? Maybe I could have gotted something better.

Jay: This is fine, given W's mistake not jump at L6. You are lucky.]
;W[np];B[op];W[pn];B[kn];W[lo];B[pk];W[qm];B[el]C[I cut.];W[ek]
;B[fl];W[fk];B[gl];W[gk];B[hl];W[hk];B[ik];W[il]C[Should I have played J8? I end up responding incorrectly to this cut and lose four stones.

Jay: J8 would be better. But, W will walk into top area. In general, the cutting doesn't achieve what you expected.]
(;B[jl]C[Wrong-side atari? I was keeping white's atari/cut at L7 in mind.

Jay; The other side doesn't work either.];W[im];B[hn]C[At this move, I realize the four stones are doomed.]
;W[hm];B[jm];W[gm];B[hh]C[I try to form some territory.

Jay: you will lose H3 stones.];W[qb];B[pb];W[pa];B[oa];W[qa]
;B[nb]
(;W[ll]C[Jay: This atari is small.]
(;B[mj]C[I think this was the best move. Is there any for white to cut me? I was concerned about K9 and K6.

Jay: This is a bit slack.];W[km]C[White takes..];B[jn]C[...So I connect, naturally.]

(;B[fp];W[ep]C[I was thinking that if white did this, I could cut and do something bad, but there was nothing really, and I lost sente.

Jay: Sente is important at this stage. This move is worth 5 pts, but gote. Which translate to 2.5 pts.]
;B[fo]C[Jay: B is somewhat behind now. 

Let's count the points for both sides. 

B has 41 pts on the top, 2 pts on the left, and 3 pts on the LR, plus 7 prisoners. So, total B has 53 solid pts. This move worth 5 pts in gote. Which translate into 2.5 pts, so B has 55.5 total after this move. 

W has 55 pts plus 1 prisoner, and 0.5 komi. And W's sente can keep the advantage going. 

Please note that this move and H14 are Miai, so can be ignored for now.]

That's the game, and I lose my half a point.
