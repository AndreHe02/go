C[RickMott [4k\]: Hi, nice to meet you. :)

Dear reviewer:

Some of the opening patterns were unusual here, and I didn't know how to handle them.  A critique would be welcome.

I thought I came out of the middle-game fighting in good shape, but it was much closer than I realized.  I made one clear blunder which was larger that then margin of victory at move 202, but I'm sure there were many direction-of-play mistakes earlier.

Thanks in advance for taking the time to look at the game!]

(;B[lq]C[RickMott: Maybe this pincer is bad?  Normal extension to Q6 better?

Pincer is OK, in this way Black exploits the advantage of being the first to kakari. Which pincer is best is another matter, and not so easily answered. K3 seems simplest in that W cannot make a 2 space extension anymore, and F3 - K3 are in a reasonable positio w.r.t. each other. For the double kakari as an answer to K3, see variation (jantje)]

Joseki can only take you so far, I doubt whether there is any book that gives the answer in this particular situation. Leaving the corner to its fate does not seem wise to me. See variation. (jantje)]

Oops! What happens to your cutting stones when W plays n7 now? Luckily he misses it. So you must play A here.(jantje)]

It is interesting that it is the marked stones that make A sente for White. These, again, are on the board because Black started to run out from O7.  (jantje)]

;W[kh];B[ii];W[lf];B[mc]LB[cl:A][cj:B]C[RickMott: Not sure what's the biggest move now, but this probably isn't it.   Reduce White's left-side moyo?  If so, where?  Does the bottom group still need a defensive move?

I think the bottom group is alive, but that E2 is sente against it. This in turn means that you should not go C3 now. This leaves A and possibly B as invasion points. For judging the move you actually played, answer 2 questions: did it gain you something? did you come out with sente? (jantje)]

;W[md]C[Time to answer the two questions. You did end with sente, and the ponnuki around K16 will help in invading the left side. On the minus side, White's centre group is not weak anymore. So the merits of your previous moves will be decided by what you now can do on the left side. (jantje)]

If you now add the right side to your territory, you'll see that the score is not bad after all...

This was an interesting game, and quite fun to analyse. By fighting hard you managed to convert a bad opening into a convincing win --if only you'd noticed--
