C[SilverHawk [3k\]: hi
SilverHawk [3k\]: good luck

MR: Please find comments starting with "MR".

Main points are:
- Go is a game of territory. Territory is easier to make in the corner or at the edge than in the middle. 
- Weak groups of opponents can be used to make territory while attacking.
- It is not a good idea to have many weak groups oneself, especially if one is afraid of them and makes small moves for living while the opponent gets outside thickness or territory.
- Spend time to read out small life and death problems like the lower left corner (this is a point for both of you, black and white ;-) )]
;B[qd]C[anada1355 [2k\]: hi];W[pp];B[dd];W[do];B[dq];W[ep]C[MR: Strange move.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[fr];W[gq];B[oc];W[gr]
(;B[er]C[MR: Too passive. Should be at F3 to produce a cutting point in white's shape.]
;W[fp]C[MR: Too kind of white to take gote.]
(;B[cj]C[Q: Was this the best opening move?  I feel like it may have been too aggressive when there were plenty of other good points available.

MR: My feeling is that it is a little close to the white thickness. Direction of play is ok. Alternative would be R6.]

(;B[cf]C[MR: Strange direction as it weakens C10.]

;W[pl]
(;B[ol]C[Q: I feel like I'm already way behind on this part of the board, as having thickness opposite white's thickness doesn't appear to be doing much.  Could I have prevented it?

MR: Yes, see comments to earlier moves.];W[pk];B[ok];W[pj];B[pi]
;W[qi]C[MR: This is a big success for white. The weak white stones around N12 are connected and the edge is a large white territory.]
;B[jp];W[li]C[Q: Obviously this is awful for black.  Was there any way to salvage this?]
;B[oj];W[ql]
(;B[lj]C[MR: This ist *not* the topic of the game. White made a lot of territory on the right side. Black cannot make significant territory with his lower side group. So black has to make territory on the top.]
