C[To the reviewer: I'm sending this game with fairly limited comments.  Normally, I can spot a number of moves I make which result in sequences that have outcomes that don't look so good for me.  But in this particular game, I'm not at all certain what I did wrong.  At the key point in this game (when White invades the upper left corner), I thought the game was about even.  In fact, I was behind by 40 points!  And what's more distressing is that I thought I had been playing well!

The only guess I've got as to what I'm doing wrong is that I'm unable to stop my opponent from making a bigger framework than me.  And that's why I'm sending this game in -- I figure that if somebody stronger than me looks at my games they might be able to figure out where I'm going wrong.

Thanks in advance,
Ted, Fedya2 on IGS


Review by John Rae

Overview :

I think that you need to give thought to invading your opponents potential territory. In this game you basically hoped that you were building a bigger moyo that White.

White may have counted and realised her territory was bigger. White certainly tried, and succeeded, in invading your moyo. White also did more to reduce the size of your moyo.

One cannot simply sit back and let this happen.];B[cp];W[pq]
;B[dc];W[qd];B[dj];W[jc]MA[jc][dj][oc][od][nc][de][ce][cf]C[JR:   Simplistically one might have the following priorities in the opening phase

first -  take positions in an empty corner

second - make secure corner enclosures OR stop your opponent from making such an enclosure

third - make extensions from your corner enclosures


Both B & W have played extensions earlier than the above order of priorities would suggest was best. This is not necessarily bad but its worth realising what the moves are trying to do.

One function of the marked white stone is to act as a pincer when/if black invades at the marked points. White then hopes to attack the invading stones and make secure territory while doing so. The idea is that black will simply have to move to live while White moves and gains at the same time.

Its exactly the same with Black's marked stone. Both players should be expecting an invasion - not expecting to be allowed the time to make a big moyo.]

(;B[nq]C[JR:

Approaching this corner is a good idea. An approach from the other side would do more. (See variations).

The thing to note is that O3 is rather low. If white can press Black down on the third line against the bottom edge Black will not gain a great deal of territory compared to the potential white gets in exchange.]

(;W[pj]C[JR: White could have taken the time to make Black O3 into a poor move.]

(;B[qo]C[Fedya: My intention here was to isolate White in the corner and build a framework on the outside.

JR: Good idea to attack the corner but don't assume    White will play along and try to live in the corner.   The gap between the two black stones is large. White should try to breask out into the centre splitting black into 2 and perhaps pick off one or the other. (See next move variation)]

(;W[qp];B[po]C[This, or P5 is nice for B];W[oq]
(;B[no]MA[nq][no][po]C[The disadvantage of this shape is that P4 means white can push into one of the gaps and create potential cutting points.]
;W[qm]
(;B[rp]C[Fedya: Now that I look at the game I'm not so sure I should have played here.  Would S5 have been better?

JR: Yes I think so];W[rq];B[pp];W[qq];B[ro];W[nr];B[mq];W[mr]
;B[lr];W[kr];B[lq];W[jq];B[eq]C[This is OK.

Things to think about for later in the game

a) white conects at M1 and those 2 stones start to surround the black group. If you block the connection and white has to make life. You may gain while threatening to kill.

b) The black group in the corner is not yet alive. White can threaten to kill and build up a great top moyo while doing so. White P4 may mean white gets O4 or P5 and  cut this group into 2]

(;W[gq];B[gc];W[nd]
(;B[ib]C[JR:

This is not a particularly important or threatening move at this stage. It does very little to expand Black's territory. White's next move does much more work

There are many ways for Black to develop a larger framework. Black can also invade the framework before White gets the chance to solidify.

See the examples for some ideas to consider.];W[qg];B[cf];W[ck]
;B[cj]C[Good - this strengthens the top nicely];W[cn]
(;B[bk]C[JR: This is too close to the edge for my liking.

Bear in mind Blacks bottom left corner is still safe for the moment. If you play underneath you are encouraging white to runb away into the middle and/or connect to the bottom group. If White achieves this then black's potential has been dramitically reduced at no cost to white.

On the other hand playing on top encourages White to try to live against the side.  Ok this also reduces Black BUT while/IF white lives Black will be building up strength on the outside.

This can have two uses. Firstly L1 cuts off the lower white group and if black has outside strength up the side it has to immediately make life on the bottom.

Black then plays to expand the huge top moyo, confident  of making a lot of territory since there is strength on the bottom and side]

(;W[dk];B[ek]C[JR: Yes];W[el]
(;B[cl]C[JR: Again this is forcing white towards the centre and Black's lovely potential along this side is being converted to a single row of territory along the side.]
;W[dl];B[bl];W[fk]
(;B[bn];W[cm];B[bm];W[co];B[bo];W[dp];B[dq];W[cq];B[bp];W[ep]
;B[cr];W[fq]C[JR: Black's got the corner and a little side out of this sequence. White has got central potential in compensation]
;B[dr]C[JR: This move is not needed

a) white C3 is in atari. If white plays b3 b2 keeps it in atari so the two stones are not going to die

b) 2 stones is not that important anyway - you could afford to lose them (although not perhaps the whole corner. Think if there are other moves elsewhere worth more than a couple of stones.

General things to think about

a) look at the outside strength White got in exchange for your first line territory.

b) imagine if White plays around K6 - this takes central territory and starts an attack on Blacks right corner group at the same time.]

(;W[ej];B[kn]C[JR: yes its a good time to look after this group and also reduce white in the centre]

(;W[jo];B[jn];W[io];B[in];W[hn];B[il]C[JR: That was a nice sequence for black. You pushed into White's territory and gained room to run or make eyes.]
;W[hl]
(;B[ik];W[om]C[JR: this seemss good for White. It supports R7, expands the moyo a little and also reduces the space for black to make eyes in the middle.

Black would like to have played around here];B[nm];W[op];B[oo]
;W[np];B[mp];W[nl];B[mm];W[ko];B[lo];W[nj];B[sl];W[rm];B[sm]
;W[rj];B[rl];W[ql];B[ml];W[nk];B[hk]C[Jr: I think for the last  few moves on the top has been more important.

For example this move doesn't really attack, although it makes more room to run further. But B is not likely to die in the middle at present.

M17 - invade and threaten K17];W[gk]

(;B[hi];W[hh];B[ii];W[ih]MA[gi][hi][ii][gh][hh][ih]C[JR: These three stones are doing nothing for black. The cut is of no value since White is alive bottom left.

The three white stones are looking up into what might have been  black territory.]
;B[hm];W[gm];B[gl];W[gn];B[fg]MA[gh][hh][ih]C[JR: Another consequence of these three stones (see earlier comment.)  black's territory goes along the F line rather than getting more points along G or H]
;W[ji]
(;B[jj]C[JR: this is  a little timid. White simply connencts or extends to strengthen her territory.

 why not cut];W[ki];B[la];W[kj]
(;B[kk]LB[qo:9]C[Fedya: Is this move necessary?  Perhaps I should have played something in the top of the board (eg. O18) to reduce White's territory up there.

JR: Yes Black should ignore L10];W[lk];B[ll];W[jb];B[ja];W[ic]
;B[hb];W[hd];B[gd];W[he]C[JR: Black should jump further in along the top. white cannot get a long way into blacks territory so the damage B can cause is more than the damage B will receive.]

(;B[ge];W[gf];B[ff];W[gg];B[hc]C[JR: Why bother,  you are connected anyway - this is another time to jump into White's territory]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]MA[ja][la][lc]C[Fedya: I think this might have been  a mistake too.  O19 might have been better.

JR : Yes I think so. The thing about the black shape is that White can play L18 threatening to cut at both L19 and M18]

Note that this move might have made all the difference to the result. black is not looking to jump in further along the top or to try and cut off the K17 stone - and there's  the cut at K12 which might be of use if the ladder is broken after fighting develops on the top.]
