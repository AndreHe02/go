C[FM: Hello, my name is Martin any my comments will begin with "FM:" as my nick is Field Mouse

Mary [9k\]: hi
Shadowrun [11k\]: hi gl hf
Shadowrun [11k\]: Thank you in advance for reviewing my game!  :-) After the fuseki I felt quite well and attacked a running group
Shadowrun [11k\]: I was able to cut it into 2 pieces and the first part could escape but the second group was in danger but I missed a simple tesuji and lost (nearly) the whole game. I tried to fight till the end but without success. I already made a brief review and added my thoughts and questions.]

FM: the best move is H, then C and D. F is quite interesting, but risky - black would have three unsettled groups on the board. A is localy possible, G is not good - it does not create much profit or strenght.]

(;B[gp]C[FM: black must be careful with this kind of move - it helps white to secure his territory and black must be prepared to take something in return]
;W[fq]
(;B[fp];W[ep]LB[fm:C][gm:D][fn:B][cp:A]TR[fp]C[FM: the marked exchange helped white to protect the corner for example against A and did not help black shape at all. Any continuation black plans here, for example B,C or D, can be played without the marked exchange as well.]

Mary [9k\]: thx
Shadowrun [11k\]: 1 big mistake ruined it ^^


FM: in this game you had a good chance and the upper hand for a very long time. Unfortunatelly, you did not play one of the two most important places in this game - A in the fuseki and B when fighting in the middle, which would probably lead to your win.
With A, remember that it is always good to enclose an opponents group in the corner so that it cannot run to the centre anymore and it is always good to connect groups without base. And it is always super to do such things in sente.
As to the B move, it was very important to play mostly because it was sente for both you and your opponent. If your opponent played there, he would gain a good shape for his group and if you played there, you would create a good aji to cut through the white stones and help your own while attacking.
The last thing you should remember is the double hane you could play on the lower side. When the double hane forces your opponent to sacrifice some stones, then it is usualy good.

I hope you enjoyed the review and thank you for any feedback to improve my future work!]
