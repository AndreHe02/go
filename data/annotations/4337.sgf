C[sylvainc [8k?\]: have a good game
Zwom [12k\]: enjoy.

Typically I prefer getting reviews of games that I lose, but I decided against that principle in that it's a tournament game (Torneo Iwamoto 05), and I was very dominated for awhile til I found a way out of a very complicated situation that I would like someone better to address.  I'm reminded of a wise phyics professor's comments "even a blind squirrel can trip on an acorn."  How and when I needed to prevent the weak group is my principle question.   I think the game gets decided early, by move 84, so reviewing past that point I don't think is that necessary.

S> Well, it seems to me that you're both putting all your eggs in small baskets. Let's see if we can't find a better way to approach the thing.]

(;W[po]C[S> It's good to get an early shot in on this corner, but I wonder if responding up top isn't more urgent. See the variation for one possibility. White still gets split, but at least she has a good position for attacking the corner..]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[nq];W[qj]LB[od:B][qf:A]C[S> A bit timid. A move at A or B is more appropriate, I think. Don't use your thickness for territory -- use it to push your opponent against.]

Zwom [12k\]: no thang
Zwom [12k\]: searching gobase for the proper response?
sylvainc [8k?\]: eh eh
sylvainc [8k?\]: i don t think gobase has our game  :-))

S> This feels weak-willed. White says "I've GOT to make the right side into territory. The problem is that it lets black do the same up top. I'm inclined to just jump to A. That way, a black attach at B isn't such a problem.]
;B[pd];W[pe];B[oc]
(;W[nd];B[nc];W[of]TR[id][pe][qe][qj][pm]C[At this point I felt I handled the opening pretty well, I was happy to get a wall that had eye shape in the direction of my other stones.
--
S> Yeah, but it's gote. See the variation for another possibility.]
;B[on]TR[qj]C[I stared at this move for a while and wanted to tenuki, but in the end I figured he would just capture the stone in sente if I tenukied.
--
S> True. This is mostly black just solidifying his position (sort of -- not really, actually) and in some ways wasting his sente. I wouldn't tenuki either, but as black I doubt I would play here, either. (If white didn't have the marked stone, it could be seen as useful to make white heavy as a prelude to attack.)]
;W[pn];B[le]TR[id]C[S> A good move on black's part. White is foolish to ignore this move (easy to say in hindsight, of course -- but recognizing the perilous nature of the marked stone is essential).]
;W[dj]TR[ci]C[I was happy to get this point.  In retrospect however I'm wondering if c11 wouldn't be better because The shape has less of a weakness and I have a very weak stone at j16.  Would it have been better to ignore the side all together and help the single stone?
--
S> Yes, I think so. let black invade if he wants to -- that's a much less urgent problem than leaving the single stone to fend for itself while white tries desperately to hold onto the left side territory.]
;B[fg];W[if];B[dh]C[S> As we can see, black can just toggle between the two threats and (if he plays his cards right), get the best of both worlds.]
;W[eg]LB[ih:A]C[S> I've been trying to narrow down my unease about this game, and I think it boils into this move. It's a fighting move, a BIT fighting move. White says to black: "Okay, bring it on!" as a prelude for an enormous, board-wide battle -- and black has the clear advantage. I tried to find ways to tweak the next 10 or so moves, but I can't find any better way for white to proceed; so I have to ask how useful this move is. If I were white, I would just jump to A instead and take a more peaceful route.]

;B[ei];W[bh];B[dk];W[cj];B[ck];W[bj]C[S> White has cut black up -- but so has black cut up white. And again, black is in a much more favorable position.]
;B[em];W[gg];B[ff];W[lg];B[je]C[How do you know when to sacrifice?  I felt the stone could be that light in that black's territory would be on the second line were it to live or the fifth line were it to die.
--
S> It depends on what's at stake, and how confident you are that you can keep everything together. Normally the proverb says "Even an idiot knows to connect at a peep" -- but sometimes it's necessary to let one or two go. In this case, that stone is an urgent lifeline to breaking up black's top, so I wouldn't abandon it.]

(;W[ie];B[kg]
(;W[lh]C[S> However, I also wouldn't make this move, which lets black continue his chopping scheme. I'd play the variation, forcing black to keep me separated -- and making some eyespace in the process.]
;B[ji]
(;W[hi]C[S> How about extending a bit more? See the variation.]

C[This to me I think saves the day, I've posted it on goproblems.com and a couple are convinced white can't get away with this because white's lower left stones are two weak.  To me this move seems rigorous.  Can black save his stones?    That is my last question and I think this decides the game but the opponent didn't resign til the last few moves of the game.
--
S> No, this does look to be a very superb move. But again, I would note that it's kind of a hail mary. I do NOT recommend relying on this sort of thing -- they say there's no luck in Go, but it's also true that this sort of move does NOT exist in every such desperate situation. Much better not to get oneself into such a jam to begin with.
--
S> You're also correct that at this point the game is more or less over. This is a huge loss for black, and aside from using the aji of the dead stones for a similar hail mary of his own, black is sunk for all intents and purposes. Both sides played well; white simply found a saving grace to pull herself from the grip of defeat.

S> I will end my review here, as per your request. Thanks for allowing me to review it, and you are welcome to visit my website of 3D GO Artwork: http://www.3dgo.org]
