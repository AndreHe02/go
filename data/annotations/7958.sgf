C[Hi, thank you in advance for reviewing my game. Any and all commentary would be greatly appreciated. Essentially this is the first game in a while that I lost and wasn't sure of why.

My main idea is that there were a lot of ko's played, which has started to make itself clear as one of my weaknesses.

I was also thrown off by the joseki which was played in the top right, so that didn't help.]

C[this isn't quite mini chinese, but i had the same intention in mind when playing this. Is this a bad move? Would it have been better to play L4?
PC: I'm not a joseki expert, I do not know.];W[ci];B[gd]C[Here I was approaching this like a low chinese fuseki. I've watched a few lessons on how to deal with it (as far as fuseki goes atleast), but this almost seemed slow at this point. Was there a better way to approach? or should I have focused on my own framework?
PC: I don't know.];W[de];B[jd];W[qk];B[qn];W[qf]C[here i was under the impression that this extension to 14R was too far for w, and the following moves ensued.
PC: Yes, it looks too far.];B[qh];W[nc]
(;B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[pe];B[of];W[qd];B[oe];W[qe];B[pj]C[PC: I would probably have connect your stones above instead of this.]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[pc]C[PC seems like a terrible move for white here.  What would be better?]
;B[oi];W[kc];B[kd];W[lc];B[jc]C[PC: I think getting something in the center would be more important at this point to develop your center moyo properly.]
;W[gb];B[ed]C[PC: This seems terrible, very terrible.  Sente move but don't make the mistake of thinking because something is sente it's good.  Center moyo is more important.]
;W[dd];B[fg];W[dg]C[PC: Now white has a huge corner, very sold, and you still don't have a stone in the center.]

C[I was unsure how to deal with this as well. I've seen lectures that talked about this move, but not any that have said how to defend against this.
PC: You have probably studied more than I have, as I've never heard of this move, I would just instinctively do the same as you did.]
;B[gp];W[hq];B[iq]C[PC: This looks like a big mistake.  Your should have CONNECTED your stones somehow, not left those 3 tiny groups all separated.]

;W[go];B[fp];W[io];B[hn];W[jp];B[kq]C[PC: ???????? This is a huge mistake.   Game over.  You should have taken your time to read this out.  No further comments.  Your fuseki looks fine but this mistake is 50+ points, you would need a miracle after this.  No further comments.]
