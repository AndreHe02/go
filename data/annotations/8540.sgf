C[Hey tavon,

This is my first review, but hopefully I can provide a bit of insight to help you get started. GTL has informed me that I should be reviewing for black, so I'll direct my comments towards black.]
;B[he]C[There are some better moves than this. For starters, remember that you should go for corners, then sides, then the middle. It takes less stones to take territory in the corner than the middle.]
(;W[lj]LB[lj:A][ln:B])
(;W[ln]LB[lj:A][ln:B];B[lj]C[The most important thing to think about in the beginning is making your stones work together. Formulate a single goal in your mind, then make every stone work to attain it:

"I want the corners." - Then play safe for the corners.
"I want to expand my side territory"
etc.

There doesn't seem to be a reasonable goal here for these two stones.]
;W[gj];B[fi]TR[he]C[A shoulder hit is generally a bad idea, but since both of these guys are sitting out in the middle of nowhere, it isn't so bad. However, note that the shape you made (triangled) is considered pretty bad shape. It's very, very easy to cut.]
(;W[gi];B[gh]C[Good response considering your current position. This invites white to cut, which will start a fight that you have the advantage in (look at the proximity of black stones to white).]
;W[fh]C[He took the bait!];B[gg]C[Good instincts after a cut. Most beginners will atari, which is completely wrong.]
(;W[fg]
(;B[ff]C[Extend here. This move basically says, "I'll give up on the fight, if you let me strengthen my group here." In other words, you punched him and backed off.]

;W[ci];B[ee]C[Again, slow. Those three were probably dead already. You could've taken one of the THREE open corners.]

[qs]TB[pc][nd][be][ce][de][fe][cf][df][ef][ag][bg][lg]C[Don't give up yet black! White's area in the bottom left is definitely not secure. You could've easily lived on the right side where you had far less room to maneuver around. If you almost lived there, you can definitely live here.

Here are some things to think about first:
-Corner, then sides, then middle - study basic openings
-Don't get scared and start making unnecessary captures
-Know what territory can be invaded, and what territory can only be reduced

A hint that should serve you fine in the beginning is:
Play your stones far apart in the opening, then play them closer and closer as the game continues.

This isn't a good strategy overall, but it should teach you to start thinking in a way that will let you understand the term "speed."

If you have invaded white's huge open "territory" (it's not even really territory - just the outlines of one), you could've won, or made the game pretty close (I'd wager W+20, but better than W+R).]
