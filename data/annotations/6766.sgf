C[Thanks for taking the time out to review this game for me.I am the person who plays white(masterlcm). I have gone over the game once angain and I know I am not strong enough. Would you mind to give suggestions on moves where you think a bigger extension would be better or a better move gobally would be better? Also, could you point out which move is a crude style? I would appreciate any advice to improving my game.

Hi,

My name is Riaan Swart, I am a 3k on KGS and I'll do my best to give you some insights into your game.

I hope my comments are useful!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc]
;W[df];B[hd]LB[db:A][ic:B][jd:C]C[R: This is a strange move... normal would be at A, B or C]
;W[eb]C[R: A good response I think.  You are securing corner territory while attacking these awkward stones.  A move around K17 looks to be painful for black.]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[mc];W[po];B[np]
(;W[pm]C[R: This is not good.  Your stones are severely overconcentrated.]

(;B[qi]C[R: Less severe than variation, since white can form a better base.]

C[Am I too passive from start until now?

R: I think you are still fine];B[di]
(;W[ch]LB[eh:A]C[R: This move is no good, you give black too many chances and do not punish him for attaching to your stone at A.]

(;W[fk]C[Is it good to play at H8 instead of F9? Or I should play at other place instead of such small move at F9?

R: This is surely better than H8.];B[gj];W[hl];B[gh];W[ip]C[I am not sure whether J4 is good to expand my territory.

R: Attaching to this stone is not good and gives black ideal shape.]
;B[jp]TR[np][jq]C[R: Now the relationship between k4 and o4 is much improved.]
;W[io]C[R: It might seem like you are creating large territory, but there are too many ways to reduce.  Also black now has now greatly stabilised.]

(;B[ek];W[el];B[ij];W[jk]C[R: With this move you are helping black to expand his moyo while gaining nothing yourself.]

(;B[ik];W[il];B[jl]C[R: Luckily black did not play as in the variation :D]
;W[kk];B[jm];W[in];B[jh];W[lh]C[I don't know what I was doing when I played at M12. Is there a better move instead of M12?

R: Looks like an OK move to me.  You have to take chances if you want to reduce blacks enormous moyo.]
;B[nn];W[nl];B[jg];W[lf];B[kd];W[je]C[I think these two to three steps are helping Black to build wall, I don't know how to invade Black.]
;B[jd];W[ie];B[if];W[id];B[ic];W[he];B[hf];W[ge];B[hc];W[oh]
;B[mg]C[R: There might be something around R12 that can be considered.]

(;W[lg];B[mh];W[mi];B[mf];W[le]LB[je:A][lf:B][mf:C]C[I think N15 is better. Isn't it?

R: Yes, this doesn't connect A and B, and doesn't really attack C...]

C[Thank you for reviewing.

R: I think you played a good game, but you can focus a little more on finding the sente moves I think.  Especially in the endgame.  Also remember to split groups.  It is an essential strategy, since if you split groups, you can help your group with one move at a time, but he can't help both his groups one move at a time.

Hope you find some of my comments helpful!
