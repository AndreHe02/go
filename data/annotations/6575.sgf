C[Hi, im playing as white here.


During the game, i thougt it was way in my favour, but i was a little suprised, having lost.
I didnt find big mistakes on my side, so please review this game, thanks.
I commented already on some mistakes, please give me your oppinion on these as well.


R: hi Aljoscha, my name is Can. I'm glad to be to your reviewer today. I'll try my best!]

[fd][pj][dj]C[R: when black played sanrensei, the usual follow ups are as marked to play a moyo oriented game. 

Black's move is strange - not that it's a bad move but asking for a fight this early in the game leads to a lot of unpredictabilities.]
;W[cq];B[co];W[eq]C[R: strictly speaking, this position isn't really good for white as P3 is already low. 

Maybe you could try hane on the outside next time. Sure the crosscut by black or double hane can lead to a complicated fight but it could be interesting :)]
;B[jq];W[hq];B[jo];W[cj]C[R: this move is questionable as it invites black to play some good moves afterwards.]
;B[cl];W[cf]C[R: so now black's group is more or less settled while white's C14 leaves a lot for black to attack.]

(;B[dh];W[bh];B[bd]
(;W[dk]C[R: this is not a good move at all if you just want to move out. It strengthen black for nothing in return.]
;B[dl]
(;W[di]C[R: this is also not a good move - remember to avoid pushing from behind.]
;B[eh];W[ei];B[nr];W[mq];B[mr];W[lq];B[nq];W[np];B[lr];W[kp]
;B[jp]C[R: there's no point in this exchange really - black's thankful for this kind of move.]

(;W[lo]C[R: this is a waste of move. You still leave behind a lot of aji in the corner. And this is just too slow at this stage. How about playing directly at Q11 or R11? 

Any cut at P4 or around that area is fine as you can sacrifice a few points in the corner to build a solid wall on the outside to work with the Q11 R11 stones. 

If black jumps in you can use the wall for your attack while the approach at R14 isn't bad at all - it works well with Q11 or R11 stones.

Q11 is the move I'd play but R11 if you want to play more solidly.]
;B[qi]C[R: this is contradicting with the idea behind sansenrei. Should be played at Q10 instead]
;W[ql]C[R: but W's reply is just as reserved - you have a strong wall there, R9 should be fine]
;B[ol];W[pm];B[ml];W[pj]C[R: I can't agree on this one as 
1) it helps black - the wall is fine and works well with the framework.

2) black's push at R10 is sente. and White doesn't really benefit from this. 

E14 still has its value as a miai move];B[pi];W[oj];B[mj]TR[nd]
[qe][nh][oi]C[R: good thing black is fickle - he changes his direction too much.

any move around the marked areas are fine for black as the 2 black stones at N8 are light. Plus they can always escape to L8, L7.]
;W[oi];B[pk];W[qk];B[qj];W[ok]C[R: black should have read ahead a bit more and treat this stone as light. P12  is good.]
;B[pl];W[nl];B[om];W[nm];B[on];W[pn];B[oo];W[mm]C[R: switching direction here isn't good. Even though black group's demise is certain, he can still get something out of the corner to somewhat compensate for the loss.]

(;B[pr];W[ro]TR[ef][qf][pg][ph]C[R: this is too small 

any of the marked points are bigger];B[kq]C[R: luckily, black played a pretty useless move as well.]
;W[do]C[R: again, there are much bigger points on the board for white to grab. If you have enough time, it's probably better spent in this stage of the game as each big move you make will definitely benefit the latter half of the middle game and even end game.]
;B[dn];W[en]C[R: probably at this stage - w's wall at this location isn't really going to yield much points, black should have played at B3 instead.]

;B[qe]
(;W[qc]C[this one was bad for me i think];B[pc]C[R: true that it's a bad move]

(;W[nd]TR[gc][db][jb][fc]C[R: But the follow up isn't any better

you're facing a black wall - there are so many points to invade

as white is strong in the centre, it's ok even if black gets a wall facing the centre now so the time to invade the top is now.

any of the marked points would have been good enough];B[nc]
C[R: even at this point it's not too late to invade the top]
;W[oc]C[R: this is bad];B[ob];W[mc];B[od];W[md];B[mb]C[R: black doesn't need this move 

F17 would have been good enough to win];W[kc];B[lb]C[R: no point really]
;W[kb]C[R: I think you've lost sight of the situation, playing this kind of move is plain bad anyway you look at it. You have several chance to reduce the top, even now.]
;B[jc];W[kd];B[jb];W[kf]C[R: it is still not too late to invade but you chose to exchange this move for J14 - losing about 30pts really. As the centre is "small" when compared to the huge black corner.]
;B[if];W[jg];B[hh]C[R: this should have been at E14 or more solidly at E15]

[dj][ri][qi][pi][ki][ji][bi][ai][ah][kg]C[R: I think in the beginning, black made some really big mistakes that normally one'd resign from. But as the game went on, you failed to keep the game simple by simply reducing black moyo with many invading points instead you went for really small moves.

you would have had a better result if you took time to consider the weight of each move.  ie. if I play here locally - how many points would I get as compared to some bigger fuseki move? Is my group really in danger ? if not can I tenuki? 

I know it's hard to judge when to take sente and play those big points but if you take your time to analyse, you'll enjoy your games that much more as well :)

If you even have more time, you can estimate the score (just a rough estimate) then you can decide whether you should play some fancy (dangerous) moves or stick with a more conservative approach.

Good luck and have fun ^^~
