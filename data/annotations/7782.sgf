C[This is a copy of a game played at the local go club.

Comments for both sides would be appreciated.

Thanks!

df:  I'll mark my comments with df:  This is a good game to learn from.  There are some concepts that can help you get stronger. When attacking, play away from your strength.  Lean on enemy positions to strengthen yourself before attacking.  When making a wall, check that it will face in a useful direction.]
;B[dp];W[qd]LB[pq:A]C[df: you mention later that you don't like playing moyo games. From his play, it seems that your oponent is also uncomfortable with them.  This move of course is perfectly fine, but if you prefer a game without a moyo, you can play at A.  This invites your opponent to choose play in the upper right if he also wants to avoid a moyo.]
;B[cd];W[pq]
(;B[oc];W[pe]LB[ec:B][ed:A]C[Played this for fun, although I think I've heard that it's too slow a move.

df: this is a slow and solid move.  You see it played often by black in older games, played without komi.  With no komi, black can afford to play slow, solid moves.  In this opening, modern pros still choose this move sometimes, so it is certainly playable.

df: if you don't want to play this move, the most common alternatives are A and B, which should prevent black from getting a moyo in the upper left.]
(;B[lc];W[qi];B[cj]LB[ec:B][ed:A]TR[lc]C[df: this move looks a little odd.  The usual sequence is to enclose the corner before extending along the edge, with a move at A or B.  A aims at a moyo, and B is more territorial.  Since the marked stone is low, I would prefer to play at A.]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[cq]C[Should I have jumped out instead?

df: taking the corner is better.  Since all of black's other stones are low (third line), he doesn't have much potential to make a big moyo.  So you should be happy to trade the corner territory for a wall.  Locally taking the corner is better than jumping out, so you only jump out if there is some full-board reason to take a local loss.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[fr];B[dm]TR[ep]C[I expected g5 here.

df: g5 is joseki.  Move 17 here is not good.  If you make a wall, your plan should be to use it to attack.  Making a small territory in front of a thick wall is usally a big loss.  Another way to look at it is that the marked stone is doing very little to help surround the left territory and is also doing very little to surround the center.  it is almost a wasted move.

df: another way to analyze this kind of result is to look at the relative number of stones played locall y be each side.  If both sides play the same number of stones in a corner, the result should be even (same territory for each, or an equal balance of territory vs thickness.  If the number of plays is not equal, in the opening, the side with more plays should get 6 or 7 points for each extra stone.  So for example, a corner enclosure is two extra moves, and surrounds about 12-15 points.

df: In the lower left, black has played 6 stones, and white has played four.   So black should have about 13 points more.   White has 9 points surrounded.  Black has about 16 points surrounded, and thickness worth two points.  This is not enough.]
;W[fp];B[kq]
(;W[ip]TR[kq][hq]C[df: this move is a mistake.  There are two important concepts when attacking:  First, play away from strength.  You have a very strong position on the left, and a single stone on the right. Your focus in attacking should be to play on the right side of the marked stones, not the left.  Your move is close to your strength, so it is wrong.  

df: Second, when attacking a group that you can't kill, make sure that the stones you play will gain something.  Typically you will attack until the group gets stable, either by living or running out.  The moves you make during the attack are free, since they are all answered.  The attacking moves should gain you territory or useful thickness.

df: in this case, you end up with a wall facing the center, but black has a nearby strong position to the left, making your wall almost worthless.  Walls should face open positions, your own distant stones, or weak enemy groups.

df: Since you don't have a strong attack here, you can leave this area and play in the upper left or lower right corner.  Black isn't going to add another move here any time soon, so you will still have a chance to attack later.  If black strengthens this group by playing at O3, you will be happy to enclose the corner, since he is approaching from the wrong side.  If black jumps out at H5, you will be happy to jump out at F6, limiting any center moyo.]
;B[iq];W[kp];B[lp]C[I was thinking about w m3 here to sacrifice either the m3 or l4 stone.

df: i added a couple of variations on m3, but don't pay too much attention to them :)]
(;W[jq];B[jr];W[jp];B[lq];W[hp]LB[ip:A]TR[lp]C[df: now you can see how bad the move at A was.  You take gote to make a wall, but since black is strong at the left and has turned around your wall at the marked stone, your wall is nearly worthless.   If you play on to the end of the game, you will see that this wall does almost nothing to attack anything.  your attack should have helped you build some territority in the lower right, but instead you make it easy for black to play in the lower right.]
(;B[po]C[I wonder if b r5 would be better.

df: I prefer r5.  The same principle applies, play away from your strong stones.  R5 makes it harder for white to make a base in the corner.]
;W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pm]C[df: I don't like this move.  The solid connection is usually better in this local sequence.  The reason to make the hanging conenction is to extend one line further up the right edge.  In this game white already has a stone on the right edge, so there is no extension available.  

df: In general you should prefer solid conenctions unless you have some special circumstance.  usually there is a reason yuo need to stretch further in one direction, or you need to make some eye shape toward the inside.]
;W[ql]C[df: good move, threatening to connect to the corner while taking some territory.  You could also play in the upper left corner.]
;B[ec]C[I should have tried to prevent this; I'm uncomfortable with trying to reduce large frameworks.]
(;W[ce]LB[pc:A]C[df: attaching here is unusual.  It's more common to attach at B16, as a probe.  Black has to choose between taking the corner or the outside.  Since his stones are low and the moyo is easy to reduce, he shoudl proably take the corner.  This gives you extra moves on the outside to make a light group.

df: you might also try to make the upper right group heavier and then attack it to make a base on the upper side.]
;B[cg]C[I expected a direct response to c15, but this seems to be fine.]
(;W[bd];B[cc];W[bc]C[I expected b b14 here.

df: b14 seems better]
(;B[bb]C[df: your goal here should be to make a light group that can run away quickly, perhaps sacrificing the tail.  Don't make a connected group without two local eyes, since it gives him a big target to attack and lets get many free moves.]
(;W[bf]C[df: I don;t like this move.  It makes your group heavy so black can make a large scale attack.]
;B[bg];W[ee];B[gd]
(;W[ge]C[df: this attachment helps him make territory.  It's probably better just to run away.]
;B[hd];W[he]C[Maybe I shouldn't have pushed? B gets a lot of solid territory.

df:  It's bad to push from behind like this.  Try to find something better.]
;B[ie]C[df: now that you have pushed, I prefer to jump from the two stones to run away.]

C[I would have done b g13 just to keep white unstable; w saving e13 would be hard and would make a very weak group.

df: black is way ahead now, so playing solidly is correct.  Keep the game simple when you are ahead.]
;W[gg];B[fh];W[gi];B[oq];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm];B[pl];W[op]C[df: good.  you have to try something to get back into the game.]
;B[qk];W[rl];B[rk]C[A move that invites the cut at q10.

df: mistake for black.  black is ahead so should keep the game simple.]
;W[pk];B[pj];W[ok];B[qj];W[nm]C[df: very nice move]
(;B[nn];W[on];B[oo];W[no];B[np];W[mn];B[pp];W[pn];B[op]TR[ip]
[nm][hf]C[df: nice big gain for white here in sente

df: something to think about.  You unexpectedly have center-facing thickness in three places.  Black has a weak group.  There are two choices here.  One is to chase him into the center and get territory in the upper left (your plan).  the other choice is to force him to live on the edge and take a big center.   In this game it looks like the center you get is not very big, so your plan is better.]
(;W[ri]C[I felt behind, so I meant to keep black unsettled and prevent black s11 later.

df: good move, from the right direection, since your stones above are weaker.]
;B[pi];W[ph];B[oh];W[pg];B[ni]C[df: leaning on black here first makes your atack stronger.]
(;W[ng]C[df: good, hitting the key point.];B[lh]C[df: The ladder works for you, so you can cut.  You are so thick below, it looks like if you cut, he dies, and you win.  This black move is a big mistake.  When running with a heavy group, it's important to make that moves that stay connected.]
(;W[lg];B[kg];W[mh];B[mi];W[li]LB[mi:A]C[df: this starts a big fight.  White is behind, so must go all out to capture the black stones to catch up, but it's very difficult to do now.  Compared to the earlier cut across the knight's move, black has an additional stone at A, and so has more liberties and more access to the outside.]
;B[kh]
(;W[lj];B[og]LB[lf:B][nd:A]C[I missed this cut. Maybe w o14 instead?

df: if you leaned earlier and have a stone at A, then O14 can't be cut.  Otherwise o14 doesn't seem any better.

df: I put in some variations.   Extending at B to get more liberties might help after he cuts, since it threatens to capture the cutting stones.  I found one variation where you get into the upper side in exchange, and one where you get enough liberties to win, but I didn;t do enough analysis to be confident of either result.]
(;W[of];B[nf]
(;W[mf];B[ne];W[me];B[nd]
(;W[oi]LB[nj:A]TR[pk][ok]C[df: this throw in doesn't help since it forces black to fill a liberty of the marked group.  Peeping doesn't work either. The move at A is trickiest, setting up the throwin for later. If he connects he is fine, but he might attack your stones instead and lose the fight.]
