(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[Mi3ke:

Jloup,   The biggest and most important mistake you made in this game was in your  fight at the top with the stone at n16.  You leaned on the weak stone instead  of a strong one.    Read Ishida, Akira, "Attack and Defense" for a really good decription of how  to fight well.

This is the next step for you.    You appear to have understood the struggle to get ahead...  Did you read the  Kageyama?    Mostly your problem in this game was little stuff.  Not making quite the  right decision about where to play, or how deep to penetrate.  Overall, you  played pretty well, except for a couple of blunders.

Remember the rule about pincering twice in the same direction.   that was the  only big strategic mistake you made.  Your opponent made a number of them  which I have commented on.]

TM[900]KM[0.500000];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ec];B[pj]C[jl: q10 was a typo, I meant q9 but I never ask for undo.   Mi3ke:  it's not that big a difference, really.  the opening plays about the  same.]
;W[qo];B[qm]C[Mi3ke:  This r7 is a bad move.  You  missed one key lesson from the last game I reviewed for you:  "Never pincer  twice from the same directio
n"

You got thrown off by your typo into thinking you had to play radically  differently than in the standard chinese, I suspect.

You don't.  Q10 still acts as a pincer against  r5 albeit a weak one.  The  standard chinese response of r4 is correct.  (even more important here.. as  white adding the extra stone makes certain that q10 will have pincer  action.)]

(;W[oo]C[Mi3ke:  this move is just what black wants.    white should instead counter pincer around o3 or attach at r3 to build a base  and expose the inefficiency of r7.

go back for the variations.

and remember that the key to all of them is that white wants to make the r7  stone superfluous, by having it add only slightly to an ineffective  thickness, or capture something that doesn't need capturing.

when your opponent makes a bad move, focus your attention on keeping it that  way.

I notice that a trick of high dans when they give large handicaps is to make  lots of vague slightly suboptimal opening moves, then steer the subsequent  fighting in such a way that those moves become key points.  this is what  white let's black do for r7 by
 jumping out.];B[np];W[no];B[mp];W[pm]C[Mi3ke: this move is even worse, although once white has jumped there isn't  much choice...  White has turned black's double pincer into a good thick  reinforcing move, instead of do
ing something to expose it for the inefficient move that it is.

Go back to see some better variations for white.];B[ql];W[mo];B[lp];W[lo]
;B[kp];W[gq];B[ko];W[kn];B[cd]C[Mi3ke:  normally the 3,3 or 5,4  points are better plans of attack against the 5,3 stone.  In this case the  5,4 to build influence on the side.  the 3,4 is too susceptible to counter  pincer stra
tegies like taisha, and the left side is very important.

3,3 would be the right invasion when there is no room to take position on the  side.  3,4 is good in certain situations, but much potentially very  complicated.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[df];B[cg];W[dg];B[ch]C[Mi3k
e:  However white played a very easy and favourable joseki for you....

note how your nice and stable low stones are hindering the development of his  star point stone at d4.]
;W[jn]C[Mi3ke:  white beeeeeeg mistake.
k6 is a decent point.... but white has just taken a big concession giving you  all that secure territory on the left in return for his wall, which you can  now make nearly worthless.

coupled with white's allowing  black the 4th line terr on the bottom,   white's still somewhat weak group in the bottom right (it can't possibly  die, but is as yet has no eye!) ... black's reenforcement of q10 with  r8,r7...  this is about as won a game a
s I've seen this early.  You have a much better feel for the opening than  your opponent (even if you do make double pincers:-))

This game is a good example of why it can be dangerous to enter early against  the chinese/san-ren-sei and variants.]
;B[jd];W[hc];B[qc]L[he]C[jl: B 'a' (j15) might have been better to cancel the W  thickness.

Mi3ke:  I think you were right to defend the corner.  Once you  have extended  on both sides of the star point, you are ripe for invasion.  I would have  played at p17 or o16 however, defending (or partially defending) the corner  but giving help to your i
solated stone near white's thickness.   
note: after p17 white cannot invade the corner unless he has nearby forces to  run to....  q17 and r17 leave less aji, but in this case helping the weak  stone takes precedence.   
In fact, the one space jump is probably best.  You have a territorial lead...  if white invades the corner it isn't so bad as long as it is small.]
;W[md]
(;B[le]C[Mi3ke:  I'm not sure what you are trying to  accomplish here.

You are leaning on the weak stone.

I suspect you are imitating a peep and surround play that is often seen in  textbooks and is good style.    The key to that play is that the peep makes the opponent protect something  which without the peep would not need protection... and doesn't give his  stones more liberty, eyeshape, or movement potential.  It's also usually done  from a stone that is in a pos
ition of strength.  It would be good play if the position facing you from the  top left were strong black.

m15 makes white stronger, while leaving your stones full of holes and very  easy to attack.

In general -- do not touch what you want to attack.  You should  instead have  leaned against white's strong stone at h17 to build thickness for attacking  n16.

back for variation.];W[me];B[lg]L[lf]C[jl: B 'a' (m14) was  probably better.

You have territory but it's smaller than it looks because of n18 (which  white should play as soon as possible) followed by the monkey jump all in  sente...  and there is still aji on the right side.

Plus white got a *lot* more territory out of his wall than he had any right  to expect.  And he got sente.

all in all not very satisfactory for black.  The game is already close.]
;W[ck];B[dh];W[ek]

(;B[ki]C[Mi3ke:  this move seems loose  to me.  If you are going to push out and surround, push out and surround...   the hane at k12 is much nicer.

I wouldn't pass on just defending here.  I'd be thankful white didn't try to  invade deeper, where he might be successful.

Keep in mind the balance of the score.  Territorially, you are a little ahead  still.  White has thickness, but here you are given a chance to make yourself  thick, and don't take it... shame.

see when black defends and white plays e12, black is about 6 points ahead on  secure territory.  You have enough sente corner potential to counteract  white's center potential.]

think tewari:

If white had played this way without r7 on the board, to then play r7 after  the joseki would be a small move and a bad one at that since r6 would do the  same thing with less aji.

It is essential that you understand *why* r7 would be small.  Basically it  captures white's stone, which is worth a lot territorially.  the key is that  for white to move that stone out early he will be creating a very weak group.   the harassment and subse
quent thickness created for black will more than compensate for the lost  territory.  Capturing moves like this are only big early if they help to  secure one of your groups.  In this case q10 is light, and r4 et. al are  quite secure without the capture.]
