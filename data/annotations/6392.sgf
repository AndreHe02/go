AB[pd][dp][pp]C[tatay [3k\]: hi
mehdi [6k\]: hello

-- To the reviewer: I will be glad if you can answer my question beside common review. Thank you very much!

mehdi.

G: Helli I'm Hervé, Giroro on the net servers. I'll try to answer your questions as well as giving advice when I see something fishy :) My comments will start with G]
;W[dc]C[mehdi [6k\]: good games];B[de];W[dg]C[tatay [3k\]: you too]

(;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[gc];B[fe]LB[dj:a]C[--I think I played wrong in here this sequence..

G: This move looks OK, but I think you could also pincer right away, at A for example]
;W[ed];B[ee];W[bb]
(;B[cg]C[G: Looks like a bad move to me. Don't attach a stone you want to attack. You attach when you want to make shape, settle. Here your group is quite strong because white just made a peep and you answered. You should attack with it, not defend. See variation.]
;W[ch];B[bg];W[bh];B[df];W[eg]C[G: up to here, the result is very bad for black (compare with the previous variation)]

(;B[he]C[G: You don't need to be so scared. Attack the white stones instead (see var)]
;W[gd];B[fg]C[G: again, you attach to stones that you could attack instead. You are helping white.]
;W[fh];B[di];W[dh];B[ei];W[gg];B[ff];W[eh];B[gh]LB[dl:a][di:b]
C[G: too early because B group is very weak. Play around A first and see what happens.]
;W[fi];B[ek];W[fj];B[dk];W[hh];B[gi];W[ig];B[hj];W[fk];B[fl]
LB[em:a][gi:b]C[G: I think I'd rather play at A, in order not to hurt the B group]
;W[gl];B[fm];W[gm];B[jj]LB[fn:a][hj:b]C[G: Better at A in my opinion, since white pushes from behind. It would avoid white playing there (see what happens later in the game).
The problem with B group is that even with this last move it's not completely safe]
;W[bk];B[cn]LB[cl:a][bl:b][hi:c][gk:d][ig:e]C[-- What can be played instead of this? Where is better, I couldn't find..

G: Well, did you ask yourself "what do I want to accomplish with this move?" I don't know what's the purpose of this move, so it's a bit hard to answer. Locally, A or B could work, A being the most solid.
Also, in this position maybe you need to think about playing C right after you have played A for example. It connects yours stones solidly, and also threatens the E group and the D cut.]
;W[fn];B[en];W[eo];B[gn]LB[dn:a][hi:b]C[G: I would simply play at A here, then maybe get sente to play at B]
;W[fo];B[hn]LB[dn:a]C[G: You need to play A !];W[em]C[G: ouch !]
;B[el];W[dn];B[cm];W[cl];B[dm];W[dl];B[ck];W[bl];B[bj];W[cj]
;B[bi]LB[en:a]C[-- I was wrong here!..

G: yes and a few moves before.. The ko at A is huge and white could choose to fill it now... (see var)]

(;W[ej];B[en];W[dj];B[em];W[ci]LB[aj:a]C[G: not need, white should play A, it works.]
;B[bm];W[aj];B[gj]LB[hi:a]C[G: A better, in my opinion];W[gk]

;B[er];W[es];B[go];W[er];B[iq];W[ir]
(;B[jq]C[-- Is there a way to kill kim?

G: No. in this position you should think about double hane, see variations]

(;B[qs]LB[ks:a]C[G: you need to play A to live, see variations]

(;W[rs];B[ps]
(;W[sr]C[G: white is being nice];B[ks];W[is];B[lm]LB[hn:a]C[G: this move hurts the A group. But maybe you want to sacrifice it?]
;W[km];B[im]C[G: so, you don't want to sacrifice it. Then you shouldn't have hurt it before.]
;W[ln];B[mn];W[il];B[jl];W[jm]
(;B[hl]C[G: not sure about this move, you need to read carefully all variations before playing this. See exaple variations]
;W[ik];B[hk];W[hm];B[in];W[ij];B[kl];W[jo];B[lo];W[ko];B[jk]
;W[hi];B[pn]LB[io:a][jo:b][mm:c]C[G: A captures B and is therefore worth 21 points, not mentioning the aji around C. But you may decide that tenuki is more important. I do not know.]
;W[qj];B[qg]LB[qh:a][pd:b]C[G: don't hesitate to put more pressure on white by playing at A, even if the extension from B seems unusual.]
;W[qm];B[oc]LB[ro:a][mm:b][ll:c][ml:d][io:e]C[G: It's also possible to consider A, possibly threatening both white groups. Also you have a potential problem at B and C. I think I would play D to settle everything first. Oh and of course you can still play E whenever you'd like, for a nice profit.]
;W[io]C[G: ah, here goes the profit, now it's seki.];B[jd]LB[ml:a]
C[G: now that it's seki in the lower middle, I would play at A to settle things there. Then white should take car of his right side group]

G: see variation for another possibility];W[lc];B[nf];W[og]
;B[ng];W[oh];B[pi]LB[qh:a][qf:b]C[G: not good shape, you can still be cut with white A then B, see variations it's an important point.]

(;W[nh];B[lg]C[-- And this one, too? (last question of player of the game)

G: this one is ok, see variation in two moves];W[mg];B[mf]
(;W[mh];B[lf];W[jb]
(;B[ib]LB[ph:a]C[G: You absolutely need to play around A to get a strong splitting attack (see variation). This move you played is unimportant and ends up in a loss for you.]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[kb];B[la];W[kd];B[na]LB[id:a]C[G: you're trying too hard. You need to fix the outside at A first. When you go for the kill you need to be sure of what you do. Absolutely sure. If you didn't read everything, then just go for outside moves that threaten the group.]
;W[lb];B[ma];W[id];B[hd];W[je];B[ie];W[jf];B[jd]LB[lf:a]C[G: given the state af A group, this will probably not work, and could end up in a loss (losing the A group)
