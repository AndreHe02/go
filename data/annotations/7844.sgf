C[GTL Reviewer:   Thank you very much for your time and knowledge.

I've lightly commented the game already with some thoughts and questions.   I think I played well in the opening, made one serrious middle game mistake, and then was a little too slow in the late middle game to catch up.

I played black.];B[qd]C[jocorbeau:

This is my first review for the GTL. I'm just a few kyu stronger, but I hope my advices can help you.]

(;B[pc]C[jocorbeau: I find this move not so big. I would have prefered to play somewhere else (see var)]
;W[od];B[qp];W[qk];B[qi]C[I thought that this was the right side to push from.

jocorbeau: yes, pushing toward your thickness is usually the good choice.]

(;B[on]C[I wasn't sure about this move.  He responded, as I expected, but this might of been better played elsewhere.

jocorbeau: see variation. your move is ok, but you could attack stronger.]

jocorbeau: 
you have the corner, but white influence to the top and center is huge. White would be satisfied with a move around marked stone, creating a strong moyo. 
but black is not unhappy having the corner, i guess. 
Of course white group A is not safe yet, but the wall at B can be helpful. 

See variations at move];W[fc]C[jocorbeau: not using the moyo correctly :/]
(;B[kd]C[jocorbeau: You are right, it's important to reduce him. Maybe I would have pushed on his weak group before, to enter more easily. (see var)]
;W[kc];B[jd];W[of]
(;B[jg]C[Ignoring P14 may have been a mistake, but I felt like I was ahead, and that if this group lived (which it should), then I'd be winning going into the endgame.

jocorbeau: maybe you should have answered, and again use his weak group against him]

jocorbeau: yeah that wasnt easy :)];W[mp];B[mn]C[In retrospect, attempting to seal him in was a bad idea.   What would have been better?

C[Now should of been the time to invade at C17.

End of comments.

jorbeau: yes, corner invasion had to be done ASAP. maybe C16 would have been better to invade the corner (can be helped by black wall.

I hope my comments were useful. You can contact me on kgs, nickname jocorbeau
