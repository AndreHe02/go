C[Hi, I'm Revenant, 14k KGS, playing black in this game. Although I lost by 25.5 moku in the end,  I felt I really had a fighting chance despite EXTREMELY poor playing in the beginning. I managed to catch up, but weak defending of the bottom right cost me the game, so any advice in these areas will be much appreciated. Thank you in advance for this review!!!

Comments: Andre Bergholz (2K), marked with AB];B[pp]C[Revenant [14k\]: hi
malamute [11k\]: hi have a nice game!];W[dd]C[Revenant [14k\]: u2 thank you]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[co];W[jd];B[jq]LB[jp:A]C[AB: Somehow the fourth line seems to be better, as you are not really playing for territory (neither is White).]
;W[dj];B[pj];W[jj]C[I do not really know how to deal with such a situation, and as you can see later, I played as though I am playing Go for the first time:(]
;B[fc]C[AB: The game is still even, and this is a very good move. You divide White where it hurts the most.]

(;W[gd]C[AB: A little unusual... (see variation for standard sequence)]
;B[fd]C[C17 or C14 better?];W[fe]
(;B[cc]C[AB: It's better to follow up on the two stones... (see variation)]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[cb]C[AB: Well, I sense a problem in your general approach to go here. You can't have everything! It's not that by magic you get everything you want and your opponent gets nothing. Here, you can either strengthen your corner stones or your two stones on the outside. The other stones will get weaker. Your move is not bad as it helps the corner group and is sente. However, you must be aware that you simultanously weaken your outside stones.

Was this the correct move? I did this despite knowing that the cut at D15 was no longer possible due to F15]
;W[db];B[de]C[so should I have just went B15?

AB: Yes, definitely. By trying to be tricky and save everything you actually lose everything.]
;W[cf]C[AB: The situation gets worse... You can still save the corner, but even so the result would be good for White. The outside stones were after all more important and you should have focussed your effort on them.]
;B[ee];W[bd];B[ac]C[Don't know what I was thinking];W[ca];B[eb]
;W[bc];B[ec]C[AB: Best not to play at all in that area. It would be much better to help your outside stones with something like H17. The worst is that your move is not even sente, so White has the freedom to play whatever he wants to.

E16 better?];W[ff];B[be]C[AB: It gets worse..., in general you should play simple moves and not try to be tricky.]
;W[bb]C[AB: Now White has a large corner, no problems with any of his groups. Black is in big trouble.]
;B[bf]TR[ac][be]LB[hc:A]C[AB: Again very bad! The marked Black stones serve no purpose and should be abandoned. There is no way that they can fight against the surronding White stones, they are just a burden. You should definitely save the other group starting with 'A'.]
;W[ed]LB[hc:A]C[AB: Small actually. For White as well, 'A' would kill everything.]

(;B[ib]C[AB: Right idea, the point is not optimal (see variation).]
;W[gc];B[gb];W[ea];B[fb];W[kb]C[AB: It seems Black is dead.]
;B[jc];W[kc];B[id];W[je];B[ie];W[hc];B[hb];W[ic];B[jb]C[Another example of horrendous playing by me, was there any way I could have saved this group?]
;W[ge];B[if];W[jf];B[ig];W[ld]C[AB: Frankly, at this point Black should resign. His position is hopeless. White has no weak stones that can be attacked. Black has already lost a lot, and the only weak group on the board is the Black J13 group.]
;B[eg]C[AB: Not a good idea. These are ko threats that can be useful later.]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[df];B[cg];W[bh];B[ch];W[bg]LB[bi:A][ci:B]C[AB: Mistake. Black will happily sacrifice the two stones. Should play 'A' or 'B' instead.]
;B[bi];W[af];B[di]LB[cj:A][ci:B]C[AB: 'A' or 'B' are better.]
;W[cj];B[ci];W[bj];B[ej]LB[ah:A]C[AB: I think to separate in sente at 'A' is good.]
;W[ek]LB[ai:A]C[AB: White should consider to connect at 'A'. No need to take any risks.]
;B[fj];W[gh]
(;B[gg]TR[id][ie][if][ig]MA[bj][cj][dj][ek]C[Should I have went J11? Seems better for escaping

AB: I think your four marked stones can be sacrificed. You should focus on attacking the marked White stones (see variation).]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[gi];B[fi];W[jh]
(;B[ih]C[AB: Ok, now the stones in the middle are dead as well, no need to make the catastrophe even worse. Now attack White in return as your other group (around C11) has been strengthened (see variation).]
;W[ii];B[hi];W[hj];B[gj];W[hh]C[I'm now terribly behind.

AB: No kidding.];B[qf]C[AB: Quite big actually, I wish you'd play simple moves like this all the time :-).]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pf];B[pi]LB[qe:A]C[AB: 'A' is incredibly big.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[rd];B[ni];W[mh];B[jg];W[kg];B[kh];W[ji];B[li]
;W[lh];B[nh];W[mi];B[ng];W[mf];B[of]C[AB: This is more an endgame type of move. Big areas are the left side with the struggle between the two groups and the lower right corner (prevent the 3-3 invasion).]
;W[oe];B[lg];W[kf];B[mg];W[ki];B[mj];W[lj];B[mk];W[nf]C[AB: All these moves have been rather tiny.]
;B[gk]LB[ah:A][fl:B]C[AB: Good idea. Still force with 'A'; first to separate, then 'B' may be a better point. Try to avoid the empty triangle shape.]
;W[cm];B[ai]LB[ah:A]C[AB: Separating is good, but the atari at 'A' is obviously much better.

From here on I felt that I really had a chance if I attacked the white group effectively.]
;W[aj]LB[em:A]C[AB: Bad, should look for more space for the group, like 'A' for example.]
;B[bn];W[bm];B[el];W[dl];B[em];W[dn];B[dm];W[cn];B[bo];W[fn]
;B[en];W[eo];B[fk];W[dk];B[gm];W[fm]C[AB: A very bad atari, gains nothing.]
;B[fl];W[do];B[gn]
(;W[fo]LB[cp:A]C[AB: Bad reflex, the ideal moment to play 'A' and get out of trouble (see variation).]
;B[am]LB[cp:A]C[AB: Complete overplaying by Black here, White 'A' is still the major threat.]
;W[al];B[bk]C[AB: Not possible.];W[bl]LB[cp:A]C[AB: White should still play 'A' instead.]
;B[ck]C[AB: More of the same.];W[fq]LB[cp:A]C[AB: Idea is good, but not severe enough. Still 'A'.]
;B[gp];W[go];B[hp];W[ho];B[im];W[jo];B[io];W[fp];B[iq];W[jm]
C[AB: White is also very confused :-).];B[in];W[jl];B[dp]C[AB: Very important! Now the White group is in trouble.]
;W[fs];B[er];W[fr];B[hr];W[es];B[dr];W[ds];B[br];W[an];B[ao]
C[AB: Maybe even unnecessary?];W[cp];B[bp];W[cs];B[bs]C[I'm back in the game:)

AB: The top is about 100 points. Your side is about 80 points. Your prospects in the lower right are a little better, so you could say that the game is still open.]
;W[mn];B[mp]C[Was this a good response?

AB: Yes, very good. White's move was not so good, he is just helping you to secure your territory while playing in a largely neutral area.]
;W[pn];B[on]LB[qp:A]C[In retrospect I think I was too eager to cut, in the end I lost a lot in the corner. Maybe I should have went for a gentler approach?

AB: Yes, absolutely. If you just close the corner at 'A', you secure about 25 points at the bottom. That should win you the game, if you can keep the right side even. There is no way that you can kill White anyways.]
;W[om];B[nm]
(;W[nn]C[AB: Not so good as it helps Black to secure the lower side. I thnk White should explore options in the corner (see variations).]
;B[oo]
(;W[rn]LB[nl:A]C[AB: White puts himself into trouble. Should play 'A' to connect to the outside (see variation).]
;B[rp];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[qm];W[rm];B[qn];W[ro];B[qj]C[Bad, definitely R5.

AB: Maybe R4.];W[rj];B[ri];W[qk];B[pk];W[qp];B[qo];W[qq]

;B[lp]C[Nonsense by me, O5 better?

AB: No, good move.];W[np]C[I think I dealt with this white group very poorly, if I killed this group I would have won.]
;B[pm]LB[op:A]C[AB: Just connect at 'A'.];W[op];B[po];W[no]

(;B[ls]C[AB: N2 is better (see variation). However, White can start a ko and has many threats (see second variation).

N2 better? This move was nonsense, I wasn't thinking again.]
;W[ol]C[AB: Bad, as it is aji keshi. Now the ko-variation is no longer possible.]
;B[pl];W[ms];B[mr];W[nq];B[mq];W[nr];B[ns]C[AB: Bad! Loses one more stone.]
;W[ms];B[lr]C[AB: Oops, now you can capture O1! It's small though, S14 is much bigger.]

[js][ks]C[AB: It is difficult to sum up this game. I think you should get away from all the local fighting a bit, it is not true that by better fighting abilities you will be able to kill all your opponent's stones! Think about simple moves that actually have a purpose. Think about which stones are important (usually cutting stones), which groups are strong or weak in relation to the opponent's groups. If you have any further questions do not hesitate to contact me at Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com. Good luck!]
