rarellano 4k: I reviewer. I lost this game (me , black) for 2.5 points (0.5 komi) .

There is some comments and suggested moves on some parts of the game, hope them help.

(;B[gd]C[I would say this move is very bad. You should let this stone go. This move is right in front of W's VERY VERY STRONG wall and the group is now heavy; You can't expect to make much territory from these stones and they just become something for him to attack.]

(;B[ih]C[GOOD. The right direction of play. This addresses the main point which is to help your top group and reduce W's moyo.]
;W[gf]LB[pm:A][pn:B][mq:C]C[Maybe one of thest points if you are going to play on the bottom but I think you have to answer this white move.]

(;B[hq]C[rarellano: this feels slow now.

Yes, way too close to your strong group and white's strong stones, little value]
;W[if];B[kf];W[jg]C[This is why you need to come out earlier.

Here you don' want to give W a large moyo so maybe settle the top first.]

(;B[hp];W[gn]
(;B[hn]C[rarellano:  I saw white's moyo turning into terroroty, but at the same time black is turning very thick to the right side. ( White could get what he wants )

Better to play solidly and press him to live in a small bitter life in front of your wall while you get the right side.]

This fight is over my head. It is incredibly complicated and I think you would need to be a high dan player to read it out in any reasonable time. I'll make some comments but I don't see a definitive line.]

This way of playing is called connecting from the live side.

In this position is is unlikely but if you make it a practice then you never suffer when it does make a difference.]
