C[Thanks for taking the time out to review this game for me.I am the person who plays black(masterlcm). I have gone over the game once angain and I know I am not strong enough. Would you mind to give suggestions on moves where you think a bigger extension would be better or a better move gobally would be better? Also, could you point out which move is a crude style? I would appreciate any advice to improving my game.

[Eranorn\] Hi, this is the guy who will comment this game. I will mark my comments as this one. Sometimes, when I say "look at the variation", the variation can be one step before. Enjoy !]

(;B[eq];W[dn];B[gp]LB[jq:A]C[[Eranorn\] I think this is too close. White might be able to play around A to bother you. Look at the variation.]

(;W[cj]LB[cl:A]C[Is the C10 stone overreach? If yes, how can I invade that area?

[Eranorn\] You might be able to invade near A later, but now it's really not appropriate. To invade here, you need to have a strong position somewhere close, else you will only create a weak black group and get into trouble.]
;B[jp];W[qj]
(;B[fc]C[Did my F17 stone place correctly? Or should I play at C14 instead? 

[Eranorn\] There are josekis starting with the move at r10, you can check that in Kogo's joseki library (also look at the variation). I don't know if it's good or bad to leave the situation as it is for now, but personnaly I don't see anything wrong in F17. Anyway I think C17 is better than C14. If you play C14 you'll be pincered and have no possibility of extension. And you wouldn't take into account the potential of Q16 which will be weakened.]

(;B[fg]C[Did my F13 stone invade too early or too late?

[Eranorn\] I'm not sure you need to focuse already on this 25 points area. This is the only place where white has points, and you have so many places where you can build something.]
;W[eh];B[ef];W[df];B[eg]C[[Eranorn\] Very bad : this is an empty triangle, this black group is very weak. Even if white pley there, you can still connect F14, even if those stones are worth almost nothing at this point of the game.]
;W[dg]
(;B[ei]C[[Eranorn\] I don't understand E11.]
(;W[fh];B[gg];W[gh];B[hg];W[di];B[hh]C[[Eranorn\] I think this is an important play, this is good.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nd]LB[of:A]C[[Eranorn\] This is too flat. Taking into account the influence you got around H13, you should play around A.]
;W[rd]
(;B[qc]C[[Eranorn\] This is not worth enough compared to the moyo.]
;W[og]C[[Eranorn\]It is a weird shape, but it prevents from making the moyo (I'm not sure if it's good anyway).]
;B[qn]C[[Eranorn\] Maybe you could play a little bit wider, with R7... The white group is still weak.]
;W[ql];B[om]C[Would there be something wrong if I play P7?

[Eranorn\] Maybe. It's a little bit unusual and the bottom area doesn't look safe to me. This is also gote so if we play a gote stone, it is probably better to play it around N3.]
;W[mq]C[How could I avoid the invasion of the white N3 stone?

[Eranorn\] I think you can't avoid it...]

;W[gm]LB[mf:A]C[[Eranorn\] A still.];B[hm];W[hi];B[hl];W[gk]
;B[gl];W[fl];B[hk];W[gj];B[ii]C[From the 69th step till this 77th step, could there be other methods to invade white's territory for more points?

[Eranorn\] As I said, it would be better to make your own moyo at the tope instead of worrying about this small area for the moment. I don't think you've got an efficient way to reduce the white area.]
;W[nk];B[ml]C[I feel something wrong with this N8 stone. Would there be a better place that I can play?]
;W[mk]C[[Eranorn\] YOu're protecting the smallest area. Look at the top (sorry to insist ;)  )]
;B[lk];W[li];B[lj];W[mg]C[[Eranorn\] It now comes naturally for white... This is threating your top area, so you need to defend instead of having built the moyo before.]
;B[le]C[[Eranorn\] Starting from now, you play koyose and yose, so I won't make further comments.

If you should remember some things, they are not to focuse only on opponent's area. Look at the whole board, look what you've got and what he has got. If he has more, you need to build a bigger moyo or to invade. If you've got more, you don't need to play dangerously, like invading, creating weak groups and so on. Try to learn what is big and what is small, to compare area and moyos, and judge what is best from their size.

That's all for me,
