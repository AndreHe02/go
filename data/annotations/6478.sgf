C[petitgo [5k\]: hello
tealeaf [6k?\]: Hey. Good luck!

Hello reviewer! Thank you for taking the time to review this game. I was playing as tealeaf[6k\].

Rather than inserting all my questions throughout the game, I've put my main questions here. There are also a few comments of mine as you go through the game as well. All my own comments are under a "--" on a blank line.

Main points for me:

 + The game was characterised by relatively little pushing from petitgo, and I ended up with a large framework. That was quite unusual for me. I felt slightly uncomfortable defending the large open areas.

 + Move 34 at N10 was a bit of a shock as I wasn't entirely sure how to deal with it.

 + I was expecting more invasions of my territory on the right hand and lower side, but they never materialised.

 + The one major invasion from petitgo was R17 at move 100. I'm sure that this should have lived, but in the end it didn't. I'd be interested to see some different or better variations than what happened in the game.

I personally feel that the opening is my weakest area, so I'd be interested to hear any thoughts on where I went wrong in the first twenty or thirty moves.

Thank you again!

Tealeaf

R: Hi, I marked my comments by R ;)
After replaying game please think about following concepts:
Don't fill the gaps ;)
Think about relations between stones, it means don't underestimate thickness (according to Go Seigen we can place stones into three dimensional space, third dimension is thickness ;)]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[petitgo [5k\]: thx];B[pp]C[petitgo [5k\]: you too]
;W[dd]C[tealeaf [6k?\]: :)];B[fq];W[dn]
(;B[kq]C[R: That's low teritorial move. In current position I highly prefer K10, which keeps balance (in meaning of overall position, playing in sense with opponent moves)
From another point of view, filling a gap is generally wrong idea. Choose move to strengthen your stones (e.g. J3 or O4)]
;W[dk]C[R: wrong idea, white has easy possibility to build up wall at bottom and one proverb says: Don't play too close to thickness]
;B[cf];W[ci]
(;B[ef]C[R: purpose of this move is to attack other side than white plays. After F16 black hasn't good continuation]
;W[cc]
(;B[bd];W[fd];B[bh];W[bi];B[ch];W[id];B[lc]C[--

I felt that I didn't take advantage of this too well. The invasion on the left hand side was partially to break up his side, but I ended up defending it for a lot of moves when the top side was quite open. Should I have jumped to the top side earlier?

R: actually I prefer white. Black missed importance of top side and got unsatisfactory result at left side]

Would somewhere higher be better? I like having a safer corner, but maybe somewhere like R{9,10} would have been better?

This was an example of, I feel, petitgo letting me lean across too hard. I was expecting a cut.]
;B[in]C[petitgo [5k\]: sure !!];W[mj]C[--

Right out in the middle of nowhere! I was a bit confused as to how to deal with it. In the end, I solidified on the right and then tried to cut up between the stone at N10 and the rest of the white stones.

Possibly I should have tried harder. Or was there a better way to handle this?]
;B[pj]C[R: good move];W[mm]
(;B[nh]C[--

These are big, wide-open moves. They felt a bit weak to me, but I felt like the large chunks around the corner were available to be grabbed and so tried.]

I knew that this was coming. I assumed that it would work, but never got around to defending the corner.

As a wider point, at what stage is it best to solidify a 4-4 point, and what's the best move to do it? (Depending on the surrounding board, of course.)

R: I think white wants too much. I don't see how to get at least ko here, except black's mistake ;)]

Done and done.

If the R17 invasion had worked, I would have lost. We managed to miss filling the ko at P5 -- maybe we were both a bit scared of it!

It's been a while since I've had a game with such large groups all over the place!

Thank you again for any comments.
