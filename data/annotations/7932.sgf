C[Hi,

This is Wonodan from KGS.

I will try to answer all your questions, and add my own comments/opinions.

My comments will start with W.];B[qd]C[I can spot some mistakes in the middle of the game which cost me some points, but I would appreciate any remarks, especially about fuseki and general strategy]
;W[cp]LB[dc:A][pp:B]
(;B[dc]C[W: When you play from this direction, you don't have a direct approach at the bottom left corner, which works with D17.]
;W[pp]LB[oc:A][ce:D][ep:B][eq:C]
(;B[oc]LB[de:A][qj:B]C[W: The direction of play here is odd.

D17 is low, and the right side becomes big for both.]
(;W[de];B[fd];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd]LB[bb:A][eb:B]
(;B[bb]C[W: Greedy.

Later white can attack because black has a weak point at E17.]
;W[ch]TR[ci]C[W: White is afraid of something.

Joseki move for white at C11.];B[qj]C[W: Correct direction.]
;W[ql];B[oj]TR[oc][qd][qj]C[W: Perfect answer.

Creating this kind of box-like shapes are very good.];W[nl]
LB[pn:D][ep:B][eq:A][jq:C]C[Now I was thinking of some of the marked moves]
(;B[jq]LB[ep:A][eq:B]C[Would be corner approach better?

W: This splitting move is very good.];W[hq];B[mq]LB[hn:A][oq:B]
C[W: Correct answer. Black's group is already rather stable, if you had jumped to O3, white would've invaded at M3.]
(;W[hn]LB[pn:A][pr:B]C[Long jump again. Can I attack such stones?

W: Your two stones are being surrounded. White didn't play P3 when he had the chance, so...]
(;B[pn]LB[qn:A][oo:B]C[W: This is reckless.

You will have two separate groups, which will both get under attack when white runs away with Q4 group.]
(;W[qn]C[W: This move is bad. Touching always helps your opponent. Unless white is afraid of losing R8, there's no reason to play such a move.]
;B[pm];W[pk]LB[qm:A]SQ[pj]C[Now I should play q10, shouldn't I?

W: "Even a moron connects against a peep"

Unless you can't find a better move, yes.]
(;B[qm];W[pj];B[pi];W[qe]LB[pd:B][pe:A]
(;B[pe]C[W: Why so aggressive? Remember that touching always helps the one being touched.]
;W[pf];B[oe];W[oi]
(;B[qf]LB[qg:A]TR[qi]C[W: Leaving the cut behind can't be good.

Black was very strong on the right side at the beginning.

It is now white who dominates the right side.]
(;W[qg];B[rf];W[qi];B[ph];W[qh];B[oh];W[ni];B[pg];W[rj];B[qo]
;W[rn];B[ro];W[rm];B[po];W[nh];B[of];W[fe];B[ge];W[ff]LB[di:B]
[cn:A][cq:C][fq:D]TR[fg][fh][fi][gj][gk][gl][gm]C[Now I think I had to invade white moyo. What was the best move?

W: The left side is very open, but white's shape at top left is strong.

"Play away from thickness"

So, we might want to find a move at bottom left.

If you only want to reduce lightly, you take white's highest stones, check the "line" between them, and play exactly between.]
(;B[cn]LB[cl:B][do:A]C[W: This IS away from thickness, but after C8 you won't have a base.]
(;W[do];B[ck]C[W: Nice move, black is off the hook now.];W[dl]
;B[cl];W[ed]LB[ec:A]SQ[fc]C[One of my mistakes. I think I should play here]
(;B[ec];W[gd]C[W: Remember to consider all possibilities.

It is common sense to connect against an atari, but if the top side would not become your territory, and white was already strong at the top side...]
(;B[fc];W[he];B[gc];W[hd]LB[ic:H][kc:D][ae:E][bo:F][hr:G]SQ[dk]
[dm][op]C[Where is the most important area now? I marked some moves I considered.]
(;B[dm]C[W: Good shape, but it's more important to move quickly or settle your stones right away.]
;W[en];B[em];W[fm];B[fn]C[I think it was overplay

W: Yes, definately overplay, since white can capture this stone.]
;W[gm]LB[co:B][eo:A]
(;B[eo]C[W: Since these stones will die, these moves only give white territory.]
;W[dn];B[dp];W[co];B[fp];W[dq]C[These stones unfortunately died.

W: Yes, no way to live here.];B[ep];W[eq]LB[hp:A]SQ[cq]C[Should I cut?]

(;B[lg]LB[ng:A][kh:B]

W: Yes. Now's black's chance to cause problems in white's center.]
;B[li];W[kf];B[lf];W[kk]SQ[jh][ji][mj]C[What next?];B[jh]C[W: This move seems most reasonable.

As you must've guessed, you have to find the furthest move that can still connect to M13 and M11.]
;W[kh];B[kg];W[lh];B[jg];W[ki]C[W: White is being kind.];B[hh]

W: Actually, a lot of wasted moves. Only the squared moves seem to be doing something.]
;W[jn];B[ol];W[pl]LB[ok:B][nm:A]
(;B[nm];W[mm]LB[nk:B][ml:A]

W: Indeed. Ajikeshi or destroying aji.

;W[mn];B[ok];W[nj];B[om];W[rk]C[W: The large capture on the right suddenly disappeared because of your overplay.]
