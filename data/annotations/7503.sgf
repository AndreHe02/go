C[FM: Hello, my name is Martin and my comments will begin with "FM:" as my nick is Field Mouse.

Dear reviewer,

this is a tournament game I played recently. I'm a European 1d, holding the black stones, my opponent is 2d. Time is 60+15/5, 6 komi.

The game soon developed into a fight, white seemed to misread and died. I'm mostly interested in direction and shape, but please feel to point out any mistake. I also added some questions, I'd be glad if you could tell me whether my ideas are good or bad.

Thank you very much for your effort.];B[qe];W[dd];B[oq];W[dp]
;B[pn];W[dj];B[fc];W[id];B[cf]C[FM: Because of white C17 this move is not very good.]

;W[ge]C[who is better? i think black gained locally, but white has a good global direction.

FM: I prefer black - white position is slow and the C14 stone still has some good aji.]

(;B[dr]TR[dm][dn]C[FM: white got strenghtened a bit against the marked group which still does not have two eyes and can still easily enclose the corner starting at F3]

(;W[fn]C[FM: too direct, making it easy for black];B[aj]
(;W[hp]C[FM: This move just forces black to connect his groups and get the side]

(;B[gq]C[FM: black is too much concerned about attacking white..]

FM: this game was quite easy for black. White played sanrensei which made him a bit slow on points but built him a nice thickness. Unfortunately, when white had opportunities to use his thickness by starting some serious fighting, white was not successful. After move 90, which was white last big chance to fight strong, the game was decided and black just won by playing natural moves.]
