C[Hi, I'm Dam63 and i played black in this game.

Thanks for your time reviewing this game.

It was a totally lost, but it isn't the first time i lost due to an enclosure of one of my group, here the left side. I'm not at ease with the upper left corner joseki, can you explian me a little what to do in what sort of situation.

I tried to add some comment where i didn't know where to play. Feel free to correct my own comments if they are wrong.

Thanks you !];B[pd]C[MonoAware [11k\]: Hello, gg];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[dc];B[qo];W[jp];B[de];W[ce]C[First of all, if you are uncomfortable with the joseki, just don't play it.

This one is a really complicated one, and you can avoid complicated situations by... well just not playing it.]
;B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[df]C[This is the small avalanche joseki.]
;B[cc];W[db];B[bc];W[eb];B[fc]C[D : First mistake, this is a difficult move F16 should have settled things ? What do you think ?

This is also joseki, but you need the ladder to play it.]
(;W[cb]C[D : And now what can i do ? Tenuki ?]
(;B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[bd]C[F14 is needed before D10, but D10 is small anyway.]
(;B[dj]C[D : F14  needed before D10 ?];W[ee]TR[dd][de]C[D: Is it better to give up the 2 stones and play somewhere near G17 - G16 ?

In this case, it is not.  These two stones are very important to your shape, so you must keep them.]
;B[ed];W[ef];B[dg];W[eg]
(;B[jd]C[D : Too far ?

It could be too far or too close depending on how you look at it, but it doesn't really matter, its preference.]
;W[bg]LB[dg:A][cg:A][dj:B]C[D : W is stubborn -_-, D12 better to connect A and B ?

This move was actually really big, i would suggest C11 to connect, but it doesn't look too good for black.

If you had gone on B13, white would have had to respond, so this move becomes a major failure for black.]
;B[eh]C[This is also fine];W[bh]
(;B[ch];W[ci];B[dh];W[cj];B[dk];W[ck];B[dl];W[cl];B[cn]C[D : Here, i don't want white toconnect with the corner, but it was obviously the wrong way to do that? D6 give the corner but build a good center influence no ?

I think that Whether or not White connects is not under your control, he is stronger in this situation.  If it were me, i would just keep extending at D7.]

;W[nq]
(;B[nn]C[D : Here, i really didn't know how to respond to O3, do you have some advice for that ?

There is really no need to respond to O3. He is claiming some area, you can just claim some area as well like around Q11.]
;W[pn];B[qn];W[oo];B[qm];W[qk];B[qf]C[D : Afterwards, i think it was too far from R9, something near R12 put some pressure to R9 stone and helps me with territory on the right side. Am I wrong ?

This is too far because white can make a two-space extension.  R13 or closer is ok, its a matter of preference.]
;W[qg]C[This is kind of overplay.];B[rg];W[qc]C[This is obviously overplay now.]
;B[pc]C[D : Is it the good direction there ?, i thought with K16 stone and R14 it was the good choice.

It is the only direction, theres no choice.];W[qd]

(;B[me]C[D : Time to build some potential moyo, i think no ? This move seems a bit slow to me ?

This move really doesn't do much.  It would be easier to attack that one R9 stone.]

(;B[fb]C[D : What was that ? G16 was obvious no ?

This shows some moe fighting spirit. I like this move better than the other one.]

D : I decided to resign here, i think i can't save the game. Do you think i should have continued the game ?

You definitely died, there is no point in continueing now.

Your main problem is not fighting.  When you pull back and don't fight, your opponent can take the advantage.  In this game, your opponent didn't return your kindness, and attacked pretty viciously until the group died. You started to fight back when it was too late.  

When you have the advantageous situation over the opponent, don't hold back, you must attack, because if he gets strong, he will attack you.]
