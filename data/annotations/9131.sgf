C[dse [7k\]: Hi

Thank you in advance for the review!

After most games that I lose, I'm able to go back and identify a handful of big moves that cost me the game. In this case, aside from a small mistake in the beginning, no moves jump out at me as blatantly wrong. I have a hunch that some of my early moves were overconcentrated, though I'm not sure what the better alternatives were. I've written my logic for some of these -- hoping you can help me find where I was wrong :-)

Thanks again.

enjoyigo [6k\]: thx

kh: my main thoughts for this game was the white invasion at the top right. What started off as a single stone managed to damage both your top side, your corner and your right side. Though moves at the lower right corner for defense and center were not bad moves, failure to put pressure on white stones caused white to be able to form territory with it. 

Sometimes, as much as there are other big moves on the board, you may want to consider attacking first. by putting pressure on whites group, white is likely to respond and try to escape, then you can take the other big points.  you may also want to work on your endgame, try to spend more time to think about what are the biggest moves on the board.

Have fun and enjoy weiqi.
