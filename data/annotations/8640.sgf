LB[cn:A][fq:B]TR[dc][nc]SQ[pd][pf][qk][pq]C[K: good for you, so far.
White have a low position on top, while your right side have a better shape, with low and high stones.
The next move is probably the first mistake. It is time to approach the corner stone. It is too early to add an extra one on the right, it makes you overconcentrated.]

K: Never stop pressing!
You did a good job, now N8 is a good point to keep white running, if he tenuki.
You can also consider to push him to the center (because your right territory is solid) and build a large scale mojo at the bottom. (see variation at move 18)]

;B[kn]C[K: very good, this put even more pressure on the white group, if you can encircle it, White have some serious trouble.]
;W[ll];B[hd]TR[de]C[Maybe this reduction move is inapropriate

K: it seems good as a preparation for an approach to the corner, but white can play D15 now making it a bit useless]

When you create a new group, it is better to have a plan to set it quickly, attacking (better) or creating a base.]

[rs][ss]C[K: your endgame is good, you gained a good amount of points in yose.
I think you played a slow opening, that caused you problems, because it was invaded (on the right) and you gained really little in exchange for the invasion, making you thick right side really small (look at it now).
I think that was the main mistake in this game.])
