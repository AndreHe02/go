C[Hi, i was black in this game.
I want you to comment specially the fuseki. I think my fuseki was good, but in the end, i felt like if my moves was not that good, bacause, even with the advantage of the fuseki, in the end of the game, i just won because a litlle mistakes of my opponent.

Thanks for review my game (and sorry for my english).

Trillian: hello, i'm a german 3d and i hope i can help you with this game :).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[nq]LB[op:B][lq:C][pq:A]C[I think this move is strange.

T: 
no, it's normal, you often play this if you don't want to be pincered, so if black pincers despite of the far kakari, white gets slightly better off. Normal answers for black is A, B, C, but tenuki is also ok, especially if theres still a free corner.]
;B[cd];W[fc];B[pq]C[I'm not sure if this is the right joseki. Any ideas?

T: Quite good!];W[kq];B[iq]C[Because of d4, seems to me that this move it's not that good.

T: 
yes! it's too early to make this kind of attack. Maybe later it will become a good move, but not yet.]
;W[gq]C[T: 
J3 should only be played to attack L3 + O3. Like this, black is more under attack than whites group. So you see, J3 didn't make sense yet.]

(;B[jp]C[I'm using this move very often, to avoid the connection. (in the sequence). But i'm not sure if this is really good.

T: 
i don't think you can seriously attack the white group yet, so it is not so important to cut it off. If you play ikken-tobi and white connects, you should be happy because you play on the outside and white makes very few points in gote.]
;W[kp];B[ko]C[Is this hane good?
I thought in jump to k6, but this will be to easy for white right?

T: 
it's easy anyway, you kannot kill white. It's just a question how to make shape with your black weak group. This move is a little difficult, if white cuts i becomes unpredictable but after whites answer it seem ok to me.]
;W[lo];B[kn]
(;W[mp]C[T: this is too slow.];B[pn];W[mm]C[Now i wasn't sure in what move do, i thougt in defend the cutting point at k5, defend the up left corner, c6, and the move i did.

T: 
K5 is a ladder. if you want to avoid a ladder-breaker, defending the upper left is fine.
I think now the upper left is more important then the right side, because your lower right group is settled already. white has no real good move on the right side anyway. better expand from c16]
;B[pk];W[qf];B[qh];W[qj]C[This is an overplay right?
I was not sure if i should atack this stone, or just protect my territory, i choosed the easy way.

T: 
yes, easy way is good enough for you.];B[qk]C[T: good move!]
;W[rh];B[qe];W[ph]C[i think that here, i taked the advantage in the game, but i don't know for what reason in the end of the game, it was so close.]

(;B[qi]C[T:
this looks too hard for me. Why do you want to keep this stone? You cannot kill the white group so the stone is not so important. See variation!]
;W[ri];B[pi];W[rk];B[rl];W[sl];B[rm];W[qg];B[pj];W[rj]TR[pi]
[pj][pk]SQ[mm]C[T:
The triangled black wall is almost worhless because of the marked white stone. Thats why I prefer to play on the other side like seen in the variation some moves ago.]
;B[nc];W[og]LB[dc:A]C[Again, i thought in defend k5, defend the corner and c6.

T:
Since now your upper right corner is closed, an extension along the upper side is not so worthful. So I think you can aim for territory now and play A. White will definitely answer so you can play c6 afterwards.]
;B[cn]C[I don't wanted a white stone here, so i chosed this move.

T:
although I would have liked better d17 before, it's still one of the biggest moves on the board.]
;W[cp]LB[eq:C][fq:B][gq:A]C[Is this the right move in this situation?
I see b4 a lot.

T:
In this shape, it is very common yes. of course only if white already has a stone at A. but there is still some aji for black to play B or C, so the next white move is also correct.]
;B[ck];W[go];B[in];W[gm];B[jk];W[cc];B[dc]C[I was afraid to play this move, because it will weaken my c9 group, and i already have the l6 group weak, but i can't see any move here better than d17.]
;W[dd];B[cb];W[bc];B[ed];W[de];B[ec];W[bb];B[fd];W[cg];B[id]
C[Is this joseki right in this situation?


And, again, i thought that i was a lot better than my opponent, am i right?

T:
I wasn't sure about this joseki and found it in a joseki dictionary. Wow, how comes you know about it? ;-)
I feel that the lower left black group is much weakened, so I'm not sure, if its the best choice of a joseki.
I feel like the variation starting here could be nice too in this situation, although it is not joseki.]

(;W[mc]LB[lc:B][kd:A]C[T: 
this move looks strange. Better A or B.]
(;B[kc]C[Is this right? Or the other move is better?

T:
I think the other move is better, because it secures mor points and it puts more pressure on white.]
;W[nb];B[oc];W[ob];B[pb]LB[qc:A]C[T:
now your corner suffered more than you gained on the leftern side. There is still a LOT of aji at A.]
;W[lc];B[kd];W[kb];B[jb];W[lb];B[ne]C[After i play this move, i realized that n15 was better.

T: yes, better shape.];W[me];B[ma]C[Just extend is better no?

T:
yes. you cannt kill anyway if outside is open, a very important principle for killing groups is: FIRST seal the group in and try to steal eyes from the outside, THEN play vital point.]
;W[mf];B[md]C[T:
this ones a big loss!!! but I think you know already.];W[ld]
;B[nd]C[T:
still don't answer! better L15 instead.];W[ke];B[ic];W[qc]C[There is a way to kill my group here?

T:
I don't think so, but still it hurts enough.];B[pc];W[re]
(;B[qd]C[T:
if you play like this you can be killed. try variation];W[rd]
;B[rc]LB[rb:A]C[T:
if white plays A now, you are dead.]
(;W[sc];B[rb];W[or];B[bh];W[ch];B[bi];W[bg];B[ci]LB[bo:A][hr:C]
[pr:B]C[Is this move right, or i should just tenuki?
I thought that i could make some points in the center.

T: where in the center? both colours look into the center from all sides. it's completely neural! but still the move is ok since there are not so big moves left on the borad. A, B, C is also big endgame.]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[pr];B[qr];W[qs];B[rs];W[ps];B[rr];W[nf];B[hr]
;W[gr];B[gs];W[fs];B[hs];W[fr];B[jr];W[kr];B[fn];W[gn];B[gk]
C[Now i started to make the points that i wanted in the center, is this move the better one?

T: 
it's ok because it also aims at making some points to the left of it but don't be to hopeful to make a lot of points. maybe 8-10 on the whole...]
;W[oi];B[eh];W[dh];B[ei];W[fm];B[jh];W[mi];B[je]C[My opponent made some mistakes here, and i getted some points in the center, but i think that if it wasn't because of this, i should not won.]
;W[kf];B[ef];W[db];B[eb];W[ca];B[df];W[ce];B[cf];W[be];B[bf]
;W[af];B[sb]C[This move is so big than what i think?];W[di]
;B[dj];W[ej]C[After this move, i was sure about my victory, but if it wasn't that and the other mistakes, i should lose right? Even with the advantage that i getted in the fuseki.
Where was my mistake??

T:
yes, white helped you a lot to make this territory.
I think your major mistake was letting your opponent reduce your upper right corner to almost nothing. The better variations i have shown you (Q9, O16).]
;B[ek];W[eg];B[fg];W[ee];B[fe]C[Here my opponent resigned.

Thanks for review my game.

T: you're welcome :) if you have any more questions, feel free to ask!]

no, this sequence is definitely NOT ok for you because you are sealed in with a small territory and white get's influende. This favours white.]
