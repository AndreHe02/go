Hello! I'm very happy that you like to review this game. I (4k) played black against j000, 1k.

Please point out my mistakes (do not hold back ^_^). I'm especially interested in joseki choices and direction of play in fuseki and chuban. Thank you very much!

Hi :)
There isn't much place for fuseki decisions in a handicap game. There is one empty corner which is of course the most important place, but there is little choise, because of the stars around. Moreover the game will very soon turn to the middle stage.
Of course its important to use the potencial, the influence of the stars and have it on mind on every move.]
;W[de]C[By this move white is throwing away the only corner he could have had. The plan is of course to make influence, which is so important against handicaps. I like this move myself. And as black, I don't hesitate to take the corner. But any move is ok here.]
;B[pj];W[nc]
(;B[oe]C[[MAFU\]
What should black play here instead of p15?

This is kind of exotic move not many people play. Its played bu few top pros, like Takemyia and is probably only possible in san ren sei.]
;W[id]C[[MAFU\]
White's position looks very weird. What are the weaknesses that can be exploitet by black?

This kind of overextension is wrong. K16 would be ok, its about the same good ditance to the top left corner as this move.]

(;B[lc]C[[MAFU\]
Is this reasonable?

Its too tight towards the corner. He can live there anyway, so too much presure is not advantageous. And on the other hand it doesn't help attacking g16.]
;W[md]C[[MAFU\]
N16 looks like a move that can only be played with a strong white environment. I think white is too weak to play here, but how can black punish her?

Yes, very bad move. M17 cannot be captured by any means, it only strengthtens the stone against the top left, while the white top right will have to make some gote for living later.]

(;B[oc]C[[MAFU\]
I decided to just take the corner in sente and leave m17 as aji for later.

The corner looks very nice, but this move doesn't fully use advantege of white misstake.]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[ld]C[[MAFU\]
Is this position good for white?]
(;B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[ed];B[fb];W[cc];B[cb]
(;W[cd]
(;B[bb]C[perfect for black. he is not interested in jumping to the top side and now he can take lot of profit. Bad play from white.]
;W[cn]C[Since white is much stronger on the top now, B O18 is not sente anymore.]
;B[dk]C[[MAFU\]
Is this pincer reasonable?

It's not. What's your plan with the pincer? You can either settle or build a wall. But neither is good or possible, because of the w strength on top.]

(;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co]C[you are ok now]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[nq]
(;B[pn]C[[MAFU\]
Is this move correct?

m3 also good];W[pr];B[qq];W[lp]
(;B[ch]C[Now this move is fine, there is no urgent place. Taking at O18 is also large enough.]
;W[qg]C[[MAFU\]
How to react to this invasion?

This invasion is nothing to fear. By the way you are absolutely ahead in territory, so you can play absolutely safely.
The point is not good for invading, sice it can't attack anything. Q8 would be more severe.]

(;B[qi]C[[MAFU\]
I decided to just take my territory and leave white weak

I think is the best variation];W[rd]C[[MAFU\]
This looks like an overplay];B[rf]C[[MAFU\]
Correct?

Yup];W[qe]
(;B[rg];W[pf]
(;B[nd]C[Big mistake, it doesn't help you in any way, but connects white.]

How to answer this invasion?

This kind of move is hard to answer, but also doesn't urgently need one.]

(;B[oc];W[qr]C[You dont need to answer this.  Playing there is important when you want to keep white eyless, this is not the case. You can play P7 now.]

(;B[ip];W[go]C[[MAFU\]
Should black treat J4 as kikashi and just abandom it now?

absolutely not. The white response increases the bottom, so you would only help him, if you leave it there.]

(;B[in];W[gm];B[il];W[gk];B[eq]C[[MAFU\]
I decided to cut white. Is this reasonable?

It works, so yes];W[er];B[fr];W[gr];B[fp];W[fs];B[gp];W[hp]

Is this a good result for black?];W[hn];B[io];W[cj]C[[MAFU\]
This looks like an overplay

(;B[bg];W[cg];B[dh];W[bi]
(;B[fh]C[[MAFU\]
The white center looks kind of dead now

yes, but this move is far from it, it could be a bit better. But I can't find a clear way to kill it, it will always have some space to struggle]

Where should black play now?];B[kn];W[jl]

What can black do now?

now you are in trouble]

This looks better for white, right? Black had more stones here before the sequence but now white destroyed all territory.

you have many stones there, but very disorganized, like the k,l13. he takes your territory while you try to connect them all. But there probably wasn't a better way.]

I felt like i was ahead before the black J5 group died. After i lost this group, all my center groups became kind of weak and useless and i lost all potential territory in the center, so the game became very close.

Again, thank you very much for reviewing :)

Yes, as you say. But your lead was very big. You won, so it ends well :) Gratz]

I think P15 is more reasonable with a position like this, right?

In chinese opening fuseki move is definately Q14 . But I have few pro games with this kosumi here, it's not absolutely impossible. The thing is that Q14 takes the territory in a very good way, since white has hard time deciding which part to invade.]
