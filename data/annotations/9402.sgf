Hi. Thank you very much for doing a review. :)

I chose this game because I feel my playing in this game shows an improvement over my usual play and yet I still lost by 15 points. I'm rather unsure about how to improve upon even the moves I think might be bad (though I do have some ideas).]

;B[pf];W[rf];B[pg];W[fq];B[cn];W[dr];B[dj]C[It might be wise to finish a joseki in this corner, as the situation later is complicated by an incomplete joseki in the lower left corner. 

That said I like D10 for the fuseki, and it is really a judgment call as to whether fuseki benefits were worth the corner complications later.]
;W[fc];B[hc];W[cf];B[fd];W[cc]
(;B[ec]C[Not a big mistake. It clamps down on the aji of F17 much more than D17 does, which may be a good thing given your ambitions for the upper center. The difference seems to be that white's group can live with greater ease, a rather fine distinction one that this game didn't revolve around. 

"I looked up this joseki and it looks like this move is a mistake. It should be at D17."]
;W[cd]
(;B[hq]LB[fq:A][dr:B]TR[fo][br]SQ[gq]C[ By cutting off a run to the right (square direction), white has two remaining directions (triangle directions) to seek life. Black appears to be moyo building, so white would like to have several groups relevant in the center. Thus, H4 follows where white hopes to keep black low, and push towards the upper side. 

So H3 feels out of sync with the grand moyo strategy I see on the upper side. There are other moves to consider other than the low pincer.]
;W[hp]C[Here is one of the potentials of incomplete joseki. Later in the game, the situation is much more defined (two upper side corners have had action in them as opposed to just one), so the incentives for which joseki to choose or whether to follow a joseki at all have changed. So the opponent is less predictable. 

I'm guessing here, but I think you saw a joseki to complete and thought it would progress like the upper right with white playing at C3. White saw that it could be cut off from the center like in the upper right, and resisted with a different play. White did not play as I suspect you predicted. But he likely would have had you completed the joseki instead of playing D10.]

(;B[cq]C[Here are those corner complications I mentioned. C3 is important to restrict the ability to make life for white, but white has an easy time of that anyways. So life there for white is not a big issue. The big issue is Black's attempt to convert the upper side influence in to points, and for that, white wants groups with access to the center.

So the incomplete corner joseki is now interacting with a larger situation, and falling back on joseki here I think misses the fact the moyo conversion is now your game. Black has lost two corners for the upper side influence, and he must be looking at how the whole board is affecting the use of that influence.  

Both H3 and C3 are inconsistent with the moyo and influence black built on the upper side. At this point though, H3 is played, so use it to restrict whites potential on the lower side. The corner is points, but it is also a gote move you can force white to make in exchange for a moyo building move or an attack elsewhere.]
;W[iq]C[Too easy on white!  The corner is small. Black is banking on a moyo. But now there is a fairly strong white group with access to the center AND good potential on the lower side. Plus Black wishes he hadn't played H3.]

(;B[hf]C["Question 1: Here I was thinking that I wanted to make a move to build on the influence I have, but I feel like this is a pretty poor move.
"

You may guess my response to your question from the comments leading to here, but this is fine move. It has the right spirit for the thickness you have on the right. There are more ambitious moves though.


"Is there a better move to do this or is this just poor timing in general?

I don't think it is poor timing. White is settled everywhere. So is black, so make some moyos, and invite white to invade. Fighting leads to points, and when it's in your moyo, you probably get the lions share of those points. 


"I was also thinking it might be good instead to approach at O3 and use the aji from the stone at H3 somehow. (see variation) Would this be good?"

I dislike O3, and I'll discuss it on the varition.];W[qk]C[I think white over extends here. A more cautious R6or7 is likely better.]
;B[ch]C[ B15 is black's follow up to this move, and it can be pretty devestating. As it is, white has an option to avoid any real lose. However, if you look at the varitions after B15, you'll see white escapes devestation pretty narrowly, and that a move on D15, D14, E14, E15, E16 or F15 is actually sente for black. This can help with the fight for the center. So C12 has a lot of merit. 

"I think this move is bad as well. My idea was to put pressure on his group but this move doesn't really do that. Maybe now's the time for my idea on the bottom instead?"]
;W[ic]
(;B[ib]C[I agree that I you shouldn't like this move. Black would like to contain and push down white (ie to the board edge). Containment can lead to death, but at least it would lead to more outward thickness.  This is a play underneath which pushes white up and out.

I actually like the hane on top. 

"I don't like this move. I chose it because there seemed to be less bad aji than the hane on top. Would it be better to simply extend up to H16?"]
;W[hd]
(;B[gc];W[jc]
(;B[je]C[It's okay. In fact, you shoudl be working to make that cut important enough to fix for white. If you contain white on the right, that connection could be their only escape. 

"This move looks like a key point but does it really pressure his group all that much? The one stone on H16 isn't worth anything so poking at that cut is worthless. Would it be better to play M17 or M16?"]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[kc]
(;B[mc]C[I agree here. N17 is again pushing up instead of down on white. 

"I played this move thinking that my opponent would have to connect and then I would play M15. Seeing how things actually played out, I think going to M15 directly is probably better."]

C[You are correct. Your game is basically over now. It is going to be very hard to make up the difference after Q13 etc comes under attack and white builds up their right side. 

"By this point I feel like my attack was a total failure. Not only is my opponent out, but now I'm under attack and I have very little to show for it."]

(;B[df]C[This is alright. It is far less spectacular a use for the aji in the C17 group than we've seen in some of the variations, but it makes black some points. since it is sente, F5 could follow, so black can get both.

[aq][bq][br][as]C[The biggest thing I saw missing here was not understanding how your moves apply pressure to the opponents stones to "move" in certain directions. H3 pushed F3 up and the end position bares that out. various moves on the upper side pushed white up, and again the end position bears that out. If you play or strengthen on one side, the opponent reacts by going to the opposite side. This is especially true in a tight situation like in an area where someone has thickness. Black consistently pushed from the side that he benefited from LEAST in the two important fights of the game, the lower left and the upper center. That led to thickness becoming weakness and the third important fight along the right side where black's group had to find life. 

The wrong direction choices also made it impossible to use existing sente moves against the upper left and right corners to help win the fight in the center. You're happy if the center escapes/lives so long as you get to kill a corner as it does so. The weakness of upper left group was particularly exploitable with the nice move of C12. The more I got into analyzing the center, the more ways I saw the the upper left was very exploitable. The threats to life of two white groups were easily tied together, but black seemed bent on ensuring that the two fights stayed seperated. Black never got to play that one move against both groups ie F15 or something similar. 

Hope this helps :)])

(;B[nq]C[This is playing into a pincer, and I dislike it. If anything, this is mistimed. Q6 makes more sense as an approach at this time. O3 will be leapt on as another way white can gain access to the center by playing O4 or O5, and in trying to live, O3 will only aid whites attempt to build up his own influence to counter black's. The kick at P3 is also possible, and it leaves black in a tough situation. 

In short, this is not an attack on whites group or corner, but the creation of a weak black group. 

As discussed H3 and C3 were poor moves. C3 more than H3. H3 could have been salvaged by playing J3 or J4 or something on that side of F3. C3 turned H3 from a poor move out of sync with your fuseki, into a mistake you wished you could undo. I think a move around O3 at this indicates that you recognize that C3 was a mistake which made H3 useless (more or less), and that you'd like to get whatever you can out of that otherwise wasted stone. H3 may develop exploitable aji in the future as play wheels and churns around it, but not now. Mistakes are hard to ever correct, let alone right away.]
