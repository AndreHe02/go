C[Hi in this game I was black. I won by 22 points I have always a few questions on fuseki.
Thank you for the review!

First a small comment before the review: Games won by a high margin are not suited optimally for review. 

here a part of the GTL FAQ:

About the Game: 
The game was basically a fighting game from early on, since Your opponent gave You a strong position due to the use of a wrong joseki and played a dubious invasion at move 26. You profited from the resulting attack,  but made a mistake in the direction of the attack. Also, I think You concentrated too much on attacking and didnt take profit on several opportunities. This can backfire against stronger opponents. 

The Fuseki was normal until Your opponent played the counterpincer in the lower right and with the invasion of the upper right the middlegame started, so actually your questions are about the middle game. 

There are two basic points You should work on: 

1. Dont attack to kill, but attack to profit

2. During attack, reinforce Your weak stones and push Your opponents groups towards Your own thickness. Dont try to make territory in front of Your wall.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ce]LB[dd:A]C[A: Nadare Joseki is an option.]

(;B[cf];W[cd]LB[do:A]C[A: at this point, instead of connecting, black could play the other Kakari instead]

(;B[df];W[fc];B[dj];W[cn];B[pj];W[nq];B[lq];W[qn]C[A: white cannot play this way because of the Q9 stone]
;B[oo];W[qq]C[A: white would have been off better entering the corner right away]

;W[rq];B[qo]LB[op:A]C[A: now the shape point of A lost a lot ov value]

;B[ms];W[rs]
(;B[qi]LB[qe:A]C[what do you think about this move? Is it good?

A: the shape (Kosumi) is correct, but the direction is wrong. R11 is too close to Your own thickness. The basic idea of using thickness while attacking (which You already know as 2k) is pushing your opponent into Your thick position (which will not be affected much by his moves) while building territory on the other side.]

(;W[rd]LB[qd:A]C[A: W can also make a base by Attaching at A. Anyway, W should be easily able to make a base.]
;B[qc]
(;W[og]LB[rc:A]C[A: maybe w should better build a base first]
