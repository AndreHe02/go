C[To my dear reviewer,

Hello and thanks for taking this review.
This game was played in a live tournament (30min + 5min/20stones, komi 7,5) and it's not complete (150 moves, I think it should be ok for a review ;-))

I'm black and my opponent is between one or two stones stronger than me

I've put some variations, feel free to erase or comment.

Thanks for the time you will spend on this !];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq]

(;B[gi]C[A leaning attack again would be better.  F15 doesn't seem to be a necessary move.  An invasion at the H16 area would be fruitless for white, and f15 certainly doesn't connect to e12 well enough.  Keep in mind the idea of putting pressure on your opponents stones.  This is a way to ensure having continual control of the game flow.

This is all I have.  From this point on midgame fighting ensues, something that is better learned from books or actual games.

Black displayed some great moves in this game, but make sure to keep your moves sente and also working well with the aims of your other moves.]

(;B[cn];W[cp];B[ck]C[Maybe better ?];W[hm]C[This seems like a good variation, but white has  splitting moves at e6 and h7.  In this situation it seems wise to keep your two groups connected.]

(;B[dh]C[This move may be played first to gain some kind of a wall before playing c5.  Your g5 group is not in immediate danger (even with h7) so you do not need to play in the bottom left corner.]
