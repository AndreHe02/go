AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[First, thank you for reviewing the game! My name is Colin, and I'm playing black.

I actually haven't played with handicap stones before, so this was a new experience for me. My initial plan was to play cautiously, enclosing a lot of territory and hoping to defuse fights. I knew that life and death situations would be a disadvantage for me, so I needed to carve out safe chunks of the board in order to mitigate that weakness.

------

Defensive play is the right idea in games when you are given a handicap. You start with a large advantage, and you just need to keep it.

Overall, you have a tendency to make contact plays and diagonal moves where one-point jumps would have been better.]
;W[en];B[dm]C[Off the bat you start with an overly ambitious move. I'd have played C6; it's harder to cut and serves as part of a standard corner enclosure. It also doesn't try to make 4th line territory.]
;W[go];B[fq];W[fe];B[fc];W[df];B[cf]C[I worried that attaching here might provoke a fight. The shoulder hit at C15 seemed too slow, and the large knight's move too low.

-------

I would have played C15. See discussion of the enclosure at http://senseis.xmp.net/?44Point]
;W[ee];B[ce];W[on];B[qn];W[of];B[qf];W[hq]
(;B[gr]C[Here I also considered H2 but thought it was too low.

------

This move is small; if white you had played elsewhere and white tried to take advantage of the opening, by playing G2, you could respond at F2 and give up almost nothing.

Bigger moves include either of the two right corners (a one-point jump or a knight's move if you're feeling ambitious or a diagonal move to be safe) and the top and right sides.]
;W[np];B[nq]C[Contacting here is greedy; P3 would have made a more solid enclosure.]
;W[nd];B[oc];W[hc];B[lc];W[qh];B[qj]C[Here I didn't know what the proper direction of play was. I worried that P14 made this move less threatening but didn't feel like going under at S12 or S13 was enough.

-------

I would have played at Q13. see: http://senseis.xmp.net/?CutTheDiagonalJump

Similar advice applies to move 22; not attacking is a valid move, but if you do attack, cutting the diagonal jump should be one of the first avenues you consider.]
;W[dl];B[dn]C[I also considered descending to C7 but felt that the cautious play was more in line with my strategy.

-------

I think C7 would have put you in some sticky situations; white could have invaded and lived, I think.
Note how you had to compensate for the 2 point jump you made as your first move.]
;W[oe];B[jc]C[Tenuki-ing here felt risky, but I wanted to solidify my side. If I fought, I was considering Q13 or S13 but had no idea how to read out the situation. I liked how my game play put pressure on white and made H18 a stronger future play.

-------

This move overconcentrates your stones, and G16 is a stronger attack.]
;W[qm];B[rh]C[This is obviously an indirect response to white's last move. I like how it strengthens my R10 stone and extends my side, although I'm allowing white to separate my right side groups. I felt my lower corner was supported enough to survive on its own and that white didn't have enough space on the side to make a lot of territory.

---------

Again, Q13 would have been a stronger attack; as is, white can easily save the attacked stone.]
;W[qg];B[rg];W[pf];B[qe];W[em];B[cl];W[el];B[ck];W[mc];B[mb]
;W[lb];B[nc]C[This is a "thank you move": http://senseis.xmp.net/?ThankYouMove

Basically, you're forcing white to play a move that strengthen's white's position.

I would have played at L18 to capture M18];W[md];B[hb]C[I think this is wrong now given that the M18 stone is inside, but I'm not sure.]
;W[nb];B[na];W[ob];B[pb]C[I had already forgot about the atari just a few moves prior. Looking back, M19 would set up a ko fight, but lets white further into my corner. I'm guessing that would have been the wrong play, but I don't know for certain.

--------

I would have played P18 in response to O18. You lose the stone, but you cut your losses and white doesn't invade your corner any farther.]
;W[ma];B[pa];W[oa];B[od]C[You make an empty triangle here, which is usually a good indication that you did something wrong (although that something can be many moves back).

In this case, though, it's just a waste of a move; if white threatens, you can always play it later, and if white plays there you still have Q17.]
;W[kc];B[qc]C[Looking back, I think this wasn't necessary yet, but would appreciate your comment.

------

Way overkill.];W[ld];B[gc];W[ic];B[ha]C[What does this move accomplish? Why not J18 or K18? It's rarely advantageous to play on the first line before endgame.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[jd];B[rm];W[jb];B[ql];W[pm];B[qk]C[At this point, I'm realizing that playing so much for territory is going to make the endgame painful unless I have some way to get into the center. This area of the board seems my only hope for getting out.

------

This area and the left side could both work, but this one is further along in that goal. That said, R9 overconcentrates your stones; you could have played O9 to jump into the center or P8 to apply more pressure to white.]
;W[do];B[eo]C[This gets you into an unnecessary fight; C5 is a better response.]
;W[co];B[cp];W[ep];B[eq];W[fo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm]C[I'm not happy with how I played this corner of the board, but don't know where it went wrong. I end up capturing back a lot of white stones around the move 160-70 area, but I would have prefered to not need to do that.]
;W[cg];B[bo];W[bp]
(;B[bq]C[This move is a mistake. E5 captures the two stones threatening you.]
;W[ao];B[aq];W[cq];B[dq];W[ec];B[ed];W[fd];B[eb]C[This corner really confused me. I lost a lot of territory here and am not sure how I should have played differently. My guess is that I had too many defects in my stones and should have fixed rather than attacked as much, but I'd really appreciate your insights here.

------

Your stones were fine; you just made some big mistakes in defending the corner; see the next note.]
;W[dc]
(;B[db]C[This move is a mistake; C17 would have caught the stones in a ladder

proverb: http://senseis.xmp.net/?IfYouDontKnowLaddersDontPlayGo
see: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Ladder];W[cc];B[de]C[Another empty triangle. This move doesn't give you liberties, and you could have played it in response to C16 (or C16 in response to D15 by white).]
;W[cb];B[ca];W[gd];B[fa]
(;W[ba]C[White could have killed with a throw in; see variation.]
;B[da];W[ri];B[qi];W[si];B[sh]C[Empty triangle, and you pay for it at 111. S14 or even tenuki (ready to respond S14 to any threat) would have been better.]
;W[bf];B[bb];W[aa]
(;B[ab]C[The capture here is not urgent. B17 would have caught the 4 white stones.]
;W[cd];B[jq]C[Looking back, I probably owed a fix at B19 here. More importantly, though, I don't like how I let white catch me in the quasi-ladder and wish I could have avoided that earlier.

-------

B19 would have been a waste of a move; your group already has two eyes, and white needs two free moves before he can threaten _two stones_. Not a big deal.]
;W[be];B[ba];W[rf];B[sf]C[I'd have gone with S15 to avoid white eating more territory.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[sg];B[pe]C[Q15 is addresses a problem that isn't there. If white plays there, you respond with R16 and you have no problems, while white is heavy.]
;W[rn];B[ro];W[sn];B[sm];W[pl];B[rl]C[Unnecessary; you can capture at T5 at any time; better play something like P11 to take advantage of your strength and reduce the center.]
;W[rg];B[sd];W[se];B[hp];W[ho];B[ip];W[bc];B[cr]C[Unnecessary.]

;W[kn];B[kq]C[This was just dumb. I should have played at L4.]
;W[kp];B[rj];W[ko];B[sk]C[Again, a dumb move. I was worrited about eyespace and forgot that I have a second eye already at ST6, so I could have just played T10.

--------

Both moves are small.];W[gp];B[gq];W[pk];B[ph]C[Now I know that I need to get something going in the center. I have no idea whether I should have run out from here or the left side, and I also don't know if this was superior to Q11 or P11.

------

I would have gone with P11. You don't have a left side; you have 6 dead stones.]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[oi];B[oj];W[oh];B[nj]C[Sacrificing in order to beat white to the center.

--------

Good call; one stone is really not worth much in comparison]
;W[pg];B[lj];W[op];B[po]C[I think this was a waste of a move, since if white played here I could have just connected at R4. But where should I have played? I'm guessing somewhere on the left side--maybe E10?

-------

Yep, waste of a move. I would have gone with K10 or M12; keep destroying center territory.]

;W[bi];B[dj];W[bj];B[di]C[That last sequence was ugly. I was something on the outside, but I'm sure I misplayed pretty badly.]
;W[dk];B[ap]C[Here I'm proud of how I saw that white had false eyes and that I could take back a good chunk of territory. I didn't know whether this could wait, so I played it now.

------

This is not a good move; white misplayed (see variation)]
(;W[an];B[bo];W[bh];B[eo];W[do];B[co];W[eo];B[fj]C[My outside stones on the left are in serious trouble, so my plan is to run across the board. At this point I have a territory advantage, so I'm just trying to not die and reduce white as much as possible.

-------

That's a reasonable assessment.
After playing it out a bit, I've come to the conclusion that you should run from the right; otherwise, white can ruin all your work by cutting you off at K10.]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[ek];B[gi];W[fk];B[fh]C[Unnecessary; if white threatens, you will just play F11]

(;B[mi]C[I feel like the left groups are all but dead (but for white misplays). Is that judgment premature?

-----

You just barely have enough space, but not enough time. Bear in mind that white can place a stone (almost) anywhere in that area and you won't be able to kill it.]
;W[kf];B[jf];W[ke];B[gk]C[This cut was a last-ditch attempt to kill the white chain. I didn't realize that white was already connected to live groups at the top.

--------

Even if the chain hadn't been connected, it has 8 liberties compared to your 2, and you're surrounded by white.]
