C[I have a thickness problem. I dont know how to use it right at least against the player Ive been playing. I build up Nice Thickness then they play a move right in the middle of it and I chase and they kill me instead. Maybe I dont know the right time to defend. Im still trying to learn go stategy. Please Help.

Hi, thanks for letting me review your game. I've put comments within the game, and more general comments at the very end.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[nq];W[ci]C[This is a strange move; surely C10 or D10 would be better?]
;B[pj];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[I like the opening. Is it good?

I think  B might be a little overconcentrated on the right]
;B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[jp]C[Here what do I do? Do I chase? Ignore and play other places? I dont like the position of my 2 stones on the bottom left. This is a joseki. But what do when white plays like this?]

(;B[cq]C[I tried to invade. others did it to me and it worked. Is it possible and or worthwhile?

I would normally play around C6

I think there is a way to live, but it "wastes" potential. You can always play C3 if W doesn't respond to your next (few) moves, if he does, then he has wasted a move.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[er];B[ep];W[bq];B[en]C[It didnt go so well so I decided to build a wall.]
;W[dn];B[em];W[dm];B[dl]C[bad habit];W[el];B[fl];W[ek];B[fk]
;W[ej];B[fj];W[ei]C[You've given up the bottom left corner, but look at the huge wall you have. Now, how do you take advantage of it? By attacking the K4 stone. Now you have two choices, either you can try kill it with your attack, or build strength. The latter is usually better. See variation]

(;B[fi];W[gr];B[fr];W[dr];B[fs];W[hp]C[Now you have to strongly attack the K4 group before it can  settle...]
;B[kr];W[jr];B[kq];W[jq]
(;B[eh];W[dh];B[eg];W[dg]C[The wall you are building now is not very useful, as the area is too open. You are now helping W build territory on the left hand side.]

(;B[he];W[fb];B[jj]C[Dont know if Tengen was good. but i felt like I needed to defend.

Tengen is good if you can kill the K3 group. Since you can't, something like M5 is much better, you need to make territory on the right]
;W[kp];B[pm]C[Far too defensive. Sure, you might take territory but you can be more ambitious, something like N5 or even O16 to build another big moyo]

;W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[kd]C[The ladder at N14 would work, but of course, W can then play P15... still you might want to sacrifice the 3 stones to build territory on the right]
;W[id];B[hd];W[ic]C[P15 is still the critical move];B[jd];W[ie]
;B[jc];W[ib];B[jb];W[kb]C[B's invasion is far too small];B[mc]
;W[mb]C[This sequence was bad for me.

It can still be saved... but the problem is mostly the lack of a coherent plan about what you are trying to achieve on the board... invading? Killing? Making territory?]
;B[if];W[je]
(;B[jf];W[ke];B[kf];W[le];B[hb];W[mg];B[ka];W[ja]C[B is now in deep trouble, W's territory on the left is huge. B does have the RHS in  compensation, but it is a lot looser, and W can probably invade it successfully, especially with the support of the stone at N13]
;B[lh]C[This is the wrong direction, P13 helps seal the RHS]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[mh];B[li];W[mi];B[ph]C[I could have played around H10 but I was afraid of an invasion at Q12

This was correct, H10 is very small compared to the right];W[hj]

I don't think so, you end up with very weak stones and just let W push you around.]

By now, the game is pretty much over, I've put some more comments at the very end.]

[ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Right, so what went wrong? You built big walls, but then played a territory centered, rather than influence oriented game. The idea behind big walls is to force your opponent inito them, and make territory far away from them, not to make territory around them. This is a very hard concept to get right (I certainly can't do it).

So, what can you do?

1) Have a plan. If you play on the 4th line, decide to build a wall, and don't try to make territory around it. Instead, if the opponent plays in the vicinity, force him into it. If you play on the 3rd line, then you have a good base for territory.
2) Don't go all out and try kill your opponent. Let them run, and build strength that way.
3) Remember that moyo is not territory, especially if it is open on multiple sides.
4) Don't be afraid to sacrifice stones.
5) To get better in fights, do lots of life and death problems.

I hope this helps your game.])
