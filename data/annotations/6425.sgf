C[J: Hello, I am roughly 2d. All of my comments start with a "J:".]
;B[dd];W[cp];B[pp];W[pd];B[ep];W[dn];B[cq];W[bq];B[dq];W[bo]
;B[jq]C[P: it's so far from the three stones?

J: Yes, this is too far. Your opponent played joseki and is strong here. You should hold back a line.
If a fight breaks out near here, you may find yourself needing to add stones you may not otherwise need to add. It is about stone efficiency.]
;W[dj];B[qf];W[nc];B[pj];W[jd];B[gc];W[cf];B[ib]C[P: Its so little. I think not because it threat L17

J: L17 isn't much more than what you were previously threatening in this area. Later in the game you could slide to K18 from G17. White needs another move here to secure territory, but it is not urgent. J18 here is more of an endgame move.
A move from the other side at B16 secures the corner, and threatens C12. I think this is much bigger.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[kp];B[jp]C[P: Now I think h4 is better

J: This move and L3 are the common responses to a "shoulder hit" like L4.
This move is fine.];W[ko]
(;B[mq]C[J: M2 would be normal. It strengthens your 2 stones and deprives white of a base at the same time.]
;W[jo];B[hp];W[kq]
(;B[lr]C[J: This is a "thank you" move for white. It allows white to cut your position, while both sides are left with defects.
See variation.];W[kr]C[J: This knife through your stones is painful. It could have been avoided with M2 earlier.]
;B[io];W[mo];B[pn];W[oo];B[po];W[nq]
(;B[oq]C[J: You can sacrafice a stone here by playing O4 to get a bigger corner. See variations.]
;W[nr];B[jr];W[ks]C[J: Letting white get a strong group here leads to many problems later in the game.]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[kd];W[ld]
(;B[qc]C[J: The result from this play allows white to attack your thinness. While you get the corner.
You may have wanted to consider a slide to S16 to strengthen and expand your territory while attacking white. See variation.]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qe];B[ob];W[oc];B[rf];W[se];B[nb]
;W[ke];B[jc];W[je];B[og]C[J: Seems better to play at P14. A play by white at Q14 followed by R13 could lead to problems later. See variation.]

(;W[ql];B[pl]C[R7?

J: R7 seems too timid. I would play Q8 as well.];W[pk];B[qk]
;W[ok]
(;B[qm]C[J: Since your corner is open from the bottom, this seems to be the only move. See variation.]
;W[qj];B[rl];W[rk];B[ql];W[qi]
(;B[pi]C[J: I think P10 has a better feel, but this can work. See variation.]
;W[ph]
(;B[oi]C[J: You run into serious shape problems here. Your stones in this area are suffering and you need to let something go.
This is where you lose the game.];W[oh];B[ni];W[qh];B[mg]C[J: This needs to be at O12 to prevent white from playing there. This will help fix your shape.]
;W[nh];B[ng]C[J: White can live here easily by cutting at Q14. O13 just makes your stones heavy.

A white play at N12 gives you 2 problem groups.];W[mi];B[nj]
;W[lf];B[mh];W[mj];B[nk];W[pf];B[kh];W[kj];B[ih];W[ol];B[nm]
;W[nl];B[mk];W[ki];B[ml];W[lk];B[om];W[kg]C[J: Game seems over at this point. White has no weak groups and your territory can still be reduced in many areas. (eg. Q2, B2, K1, B17)]
;B[dl];W[cj];B[bl]C[J: Very risky, but you are behind. Normally you would pull out to prevent white from having his way with a weak group.]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[fn];B[fl];W[fj];B[hl];W[br];B[cr];W[hj];B[hn]
;W[hf];B[gk];W[ii];B[ff];W[hh];B[dg];W[cg];B[dh];W[bc];B[bb]
;W[fh];B[fg];W[cd];B[db];W[de];B[ee];W[js]
(;B[ir]C[J: Should be H2. See variation.];W[is];B[hr];W[hs]
;B[gs];W[gm];B[gl];W[hm];B[il];W[im]C[J: There is no clear way to save these stones that I see.]
;B[jl];W[ll]C[blas [4k\]: thx
rgw [4k\]: Thanks

J: Not a lot went your way this game. Allowing white to get a solid group (L4 group) in the middle of your strength made fighting difficult.
In the fight that ruined you on the right side, you were scrambling to work with weak groups with poor shape. In these fights you need to be more mindful of the strength of groups and patiently let your opponent get what he deserves.
I hope this helps!
