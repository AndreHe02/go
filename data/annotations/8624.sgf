C[My main concerns are:

1. Whenever I invade in games, it doesn't seem to work well for me, whereas when my opponent invades, it seems to work well.  I want to know why.

2. I often feel that I did okay in the beginning, but in the middle game I often have no idea what moves to play and just play something for no real reason.  I want to understand how to decide which among many, many possible moves is good.  Especially, I'd like to know when it's a good idea to play a defensive move vs an offensive one.

My concerns are more about long-term strategy and direction of play than local play.  I sometimes make mistakes in local play, but I'm pretty sure it's usually because I'm too lazy to read out as much as I'm capable of, and I just play something hoping it will work.

I often find game commentaries a little hard to make use of, because they tend to say "you should have done this" without explaining HOW I should have known that.  I would appreciate comments that explain how I could tell, from looking at the existing board position, what move to play.

Thanks.];B[pp]C[BrenBarn [4k\]: Hi

(;W[dn]LB[jp:A][jq:B]C[I read about this move on Sensei's Library.  It feels better to me than wedging at A or B, so I usually play it if my opponent plays this opening.

Actually, this move is not good. It is played when black have large framework here.]

(;W[nq]C[Quite wrong direction. You are playing too dense. Black will probably use that to cut you in pieces.]
(;B[kq]C[This is a reply I wasn't familiar with.  I tried to make the best of it.

Black did his best to use the weakness of two white stones on the left.]

(;W[jj]LB[kc:D][ch:C][dl:B][pl:A][io:E][no:F]C[This is one of those cases where I don't know what to play.  I played this move because I felt it could, in a vague way, support both lower groups while also having influence on the top.  A-F are some other areas I thought about making moves instead.

What I do not know, and would like to learn is not what move to make in this position, but HOW TO TELL what would be a good move.

Actually, this move is the first losing move.]

(;W[ke];B[nd]C[This is the kind of move I never know how to deal with.  I feel like, whenever someone invades, I tend to shift my idea of where to make territory, and decide "well, since he invaded there, I'll make territory over here instead" and attack accordingly.  But over time, that plan has to be changed again, and again, and in the end I don't get much of what I'd planned for.

Well, here white is too far away from each other]

There are lots of places where a nasty move like this is possible.  often I am aware that such moves are possible.  What I don't know is how to tell when it is a good idea to go back and protect against these moves, instead of playing a different move elsewhere.

Again, the issue is not "should I reinforce against such a move" but HOW CAN I TELL when the time is right to do so.]
