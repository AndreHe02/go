C[Hi!
This is a game i played recently on KGS and lost by a large amount :(

Could you give me some advice on the openening and how to fight better?

Also could you tell me why I was slaughtered?

Thanks for reviewing.

W> I'll be marking my comments in this way (W is my prefered nickname/handle on the internet), if you have further questions you can mark them below in a similar style. If I use terms you do not recognize, they are probably japanese; check out http://senseis.xmp.net/?JapaneseGoTerms

There isn't much I can say about the opening; just try to keep a balance between your own influence and territory, and what the opponent is doing. Don't focus on attack or defence unless a specific opportunity arrises.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq]C[i don't deal with this opening too often, but when it comes up, i'm not sure about the usual way of dealing with it.

W> You mean you're sure what to do whenever anyone plays anything else? You should teach me! But seriously, insecurity about the opening is a sign that you know your limits; the opening is in my opinion the part of the game that is hardest to grasp, perhaps because it is so intuitive and with ambiguous or hard to grasp rules.

There are some guidelines tho; third line stones should aim for territory and security, fourth line stones for outward influence while giving a greater chance of invasion.

At this point black has taken low points in both corners, perhaps because he likes to get safe territory in the start, perhaps because he wishes to attack you and make a strong fighting game, or perhaps he is just used to playing this way. It is on our level too commonly the last, and trying to outthink the opponent in the opening is not very useful.

After this, I like to play E16 or D17; the first focuses on countering the influence of a black shimari after P17, the second on striking a balance in territory.]
;W[dd]C[W> Nothing wrong with this];B[oc];W[qo]C[W> Fine];B[qk]
;W[op]C[W> Possibly a bit too agressive on the corner. R9 is weak aswell, and striking a balance between putting pressure on it and on the corner is often a good idea.

P5 or Q6 instead];B[po];W[pp];B[qp]
(;W[rp]C[W> You could take the corner here with R3, which would avoid alot of fighting.]
;B[qq]
(;W[pn]C[I think I did something bad here?

W> It ignores the S4 stone; if you wanted to play this (in and of itself an acceptable move) you should not have played S4 first. An alternative to Q6 here is R6, or even R5; you could have pressed the corner from the top side, and lived easilly, perhaps at the cost of P4 and Q4 in the middle game.]
;B[oq]
(;W[np]C[W> Capture instead. The Q5 stone threatens several things; it can escape if the ladder is broken, it enables the R5 move, and it might enable a similar move threatening O4 later.Just because it is captured doesn't mean you can't remove it from the board, or that it is necesarilly useless to your opponent.]
;B[mr]
(;W[qi]C[W> You are too weak to be attacking just yett. If you had captured Q5 you could play this for a fighting game, but as it is it only gives black outside influence and free splitting attack.]
;B[ok];W[oi];B[mk]TR[qk]C[I felt that this attack weakened my own stones at the bottom.
A better way to attack the marked stone?

W> First build up strenght all around, THEN attack. Outside influence on the top side (K16 for instance) and securing an edge connection for R5 (S3?) is some of the things that could have enabled an effective attack. As it is you should be happy if both groups live, as black had strong groups here to start with.]
;W[nn]C[W> Don't be afraid of the simple moves, P5 is ok here, and gives less threats on your group later.]
;B[ro];W[qn];B[rn]
(;W[mi]C[W> At this point I would be concerned about the life of the lower right group; it is much heavier and hard to sacrifice parts of.]
;B[qg];W[dj]C[maybe this isn't important enough?

W> This is a big point, and helps both your struggling groups as well, because of the outside influence.]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[cf];W[ee];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd]
(;W[eg]C[W> This is too weak a connection and helps blacks F17 stone become more useful. Play in the other direction, towards what's potentially your own territory, instead of pressing black to expand his own. The outside influence is the same.]
;B[de];W[fd]C[W> Bad choice; again don't be afraid of the simple moves, connect straight away with E16.]
;B[db];W[cb]C[W> You can't cut black here, just connect as you should have from the start.]
;B[eb];W[bc]C[W> Useless move, black has no problems stopping you with B16. Even if you reply to that you are dead.]

(;B[ed];W[fe]SQ[lc][mf][jj][jl]C[W> Good salvage. You now have a solid group on the outside. It is not enough compensation for letting black take your corner (and so much territory) but it is very useful for the N11 string of stones, and you can think about building a moyo in the middle.]
;B[ch];W[kc]C[W> Good move, grabs definite territory on the top edge, while also building framework for a big center moyo]
;B[og];W[ng]C[W> A bit too close; black is too strong here to stop him directly, you're forced to stay back.]
;B[nf]
(;W[mf]C[W> Blacks O14 is a standard move, with a standard response; N13. You need to play strongly to gain the lost ground, but you should consider the risks and make sure you aren't just losing even more.]
;B[nh];W[mg]
(;B[ni]C[W> Wrong start for black, it gives you O10 for free which threatens to cut at O9]
;W[nj];B[oh];W[oj];B[nk];W[mj]
(;B[ll]C[W> obvious mistake by black; he is almost certainly alive on the right edge, and could cut you to pieces starting with N12.]
;W[mh];B[ne]
(;W[jj]C[W> This is not the place for timid defensive moves; L9 expands the framework more, and presses black down, inducing you to defend O4 once and for all.]
;B[eh]
(;W[fh]C[W> Don't just defend, try to counterattack as well; the tower formation (E12 C12 and C14) is vulnerable from D13, play it first to see how black responds]
;B[ei]C[W> See the parallel from N14/N13. Black plays correctly.]

(;W[fg]C[W> Again too timid. The outside here is safely in your sphere of influence, you can allow a few cutting points. Expand your area with F11 instead.]
;B[fi]
(;W[cm]C[W> Big point, but it ignores blacks threat, which is significant. He can get into your area and reduce it to nil.]
;B[ld]
(;W[nq]C[W> Again you ignore your area, and for a small threat that gives black what he wants anyway.]
;B[nr];W[lp];B[kq];W[kp];B[jq]TR[mk][nk][ok][qk][ll]C[I know that pushing from behind is bad, but i was trying to attack the marked stones. Is that okay?

W> No, black has too many options on the right side, and is very solid. You still have a chance of getting territory to rival black, without killing something huge.]
;W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[er]TR[fr][gr][hr][ir][jr][kr][lr][es][fs]
[gs][hs][is][js][ks][ls]C[W> This is probably where you lost for sure; black gained more territory, while you gained nothing. You have one of four corners, and all blacks corners and sides are high and big. You have no territory to speak of.]
;W[rm];B[rq];W[qm];B[ri];W[rj];B[qj];W[rh];B[pi];W[si];B[pj]
C[i figured out a way to seperate him afterwards... unfortunately

W> There is no way to separate him now, only some bad aji. He ignored a ko threat to let you cut.]
;W[ph]C[W> Better to let the threat stay than to play it out when you don't know what you want from it.]
;B[qh];W[rk];B[cq];W[cp];B[bq];W[gr];B[fq];W[gq];B[fp];W[gp]
;B[fn];W[bi];B[bh];W[ci];B[go];W[ho];B[hn]
(;W[in]C[W> Not an important point; the outside influence is worthless anyway, with no weak groups to attack or any potential for territory.]
;B[hm];W[ke];B[le];W[kf];B[lc]C[W> G11 is huge here.];W[kb]
;B[hi];W[ih]C[W> You are being "led around" by black; you respond when and where he plays instead of ignoring his moves to make bigger threats yourself. A sure way to lose.]
;B[ii];W[ji];B[hh];W[hg];B[ik];W[me];B[nd];W[md];B[mc];W[rg]
;B[qf];W[fl]C[this was a bad move, now looking, f9 might've been better
W> It's not very important; black can get 6-7 points here, tops.]
;B[im];W[jn]C[W> Another unimportant point; two points territory or so.]
;B[ek];W[dk];B[el];W[ej];B[fj];W[em];B[fk]
(;W[fm]C[W> Trying to save the wrong stone. Let black have the 3-4 points of capturing F8, and save E7 instead.]

(;B[bp];W[eq]C[i know it was almost impossible to rescue these stones (i got really lucky), but could you give me some advice on how to rescue outnumberd stones in grave danger?

W> No, not really. Having such advice is counterproductive; better to see that the risk to the group is real, than to cling to the hope of a miraculous rescue. The advice would all be about trick plays and ways to make your opponent ignore your threats.]

(;B[cr];W[bk];B[kd];W[jd];B[gc];W[gd];B[hb];W[ic];B[jm];W[kn]
;B[kk];W[sd]C[W> Big important point; certainly much bigger than L6.]
