C[Hi
I am black in this game. The komi is 0.5 point and won by 5.5 points.
I think i should lose if komi is 5.5 or 6.5 points.
Please spot my fault and give me some comment.
Thank you.

Hello,
my name is Peter Strempel, I play somewhat around 8k level.
I admit I am wondering about your given 28k rank. You play much better than the usual IGS 28k.
I will try to comment on your problems and give some variations as alternative ideas.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp]
(;B[ce]C[This move is good. An interesting alternative might be the mini-chinese opening as shown in the variation.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pf]C[Instead you could consider to play a pincer which would at the same time be a good extension from your upper left corner.]

(;W[qb]C[This white move is strange. Q18 instead would be the standard pattern.]

(;B[qc];W[pb];B[lc]C[Good move! This shows why whites R18 was a mistake. A white extension on the top had been big.]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd];W[rb]
(;B[le]TR[qk][qn]C[Instead I would prefer an extension on the right side, or an approach move towards Q4.
You fear a white move around K17? But there is no reason yet. See variations.]

(;W[md];B[ld]C[Black is fine, white destroyed the possibility to peep from the other side at L16. N16 does not help white much, the corner is alive and not interesting anymore.]
;W[qm];B[qk]C[Good.];W[pk];B[pj];W[pl];B[qj];W[fq];B[mq];W[pq]
;B[jq];W[iq]
(;B[ip]TR[jp]C[Consider the variation.];W[hq];B[mo]LB[jp:A]
C[You should protect at A, else white can destroy your eyeshape quickly. So the play in the earlier variation where you play A instantly instead the hane looked better to me.]

(;W[dm];B[ck];W[cp];B[ek]C[So far black looks good on the board, except the weakness on the bottom. If white invades the top, you can attack severly.]

(;W[fd]LB[ee:A]C[The usual reduction play against a shimari would be at (A), which can be followed by an attachment.]

(;B[ec]TR[ee][hd]C[This looks like the first real bad black move in this game. It appears very slow, does not attack white severly, and does not make many points for you.
One of the marked triangle spots looks more active while attacking white. Your corner is strong enough, no need to reinforce it yet. Better to attack white from the outside.]
;W[fc];B[hd];W[hc]
(;B[gd]C[This "bumps" the head of two stones into white stones, you create bad shape for yourself.]
;W[gc];B[ic]C[Your shape is too weak, you cannot play this. White will cut.]

(;W[ib];B[jc];W[jb]
(;B[kc];W[ge];B[he];W[ee];B[df];W[gf];B[bm]C[This move is small. It is more urgent to protect your weakness on the bottom with a play at K2 or K4.
White can launch a severe attack on that group.];W[cm];B[bl]
;W[bn];B[nj];W[jp]C[Yes. You ignored this weakness too long.]
;B[kp];W[jo];B[ko];W[io];B[lm]
(;W[jr];B[kq];W[dk];B[dj];W[dl];B[on];W[pn];B[oo];W[po]C[White says "Thank you". You helped white to get a solid territory, while those two stones you just played dont do much for yourself.]
;B[ne];W[mb];B[ig];W[cq]C[I do not understand this move. White could have passed, too.]
;B[ik];W[el];B[fk];W[fl];B[gk];W[gl];B[hl];W[hm];B[im];W[hn]

As far as I can see it, white is dead. Resign time for white.]

;B[gj];W[gb];B[mm];C[You definately do not play like the 28k rank suggests. Actually I think, you were the stronger player in this game. You could have won much bigger if you not made the mistake at K19.

Your opening was quite ok. You left a weak group at the bottom, that was a mistake. White should have been able to punish that more severly.
When white invaded the top, you failed to attack more severe. You should attack an invasion from the outside and force the opponent to live small, while you gain either points or influence from the attack.
Sometimes you play defensive moves when there is no need (O16), but then you create shapes which have a weakness instead of playing solid. Try to concentrate on creating solid groups and good shape, then you dont leave weaknesses behind you need to defend in gote. I know that is no easy task, of course, and I wish I would be able to apply it in my own games, too. :)

Anyways, you have well earned the win in this game, you had won much higher without the error at K19.]
