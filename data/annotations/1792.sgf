RE[W+27.5]

C[Thank you for reviewing my game. I am playing  black. Since this was played on a turn based site  and took quite a while to play, I have no real  questions.    I am studying tesuji right now, but am finding it  difficult to translate book knowledge into practical  knowledge. During the game, could you indicate  where there is a tesuji play?
  Thanks again for taking the time to review the  game.

;W[bn];B[co];W[cm];B[cj];W[el];B[eo]SQ[ep]C[This is not necessary and not good, prompting white to play marked square that strengthens white.]
;W[fj]LB[ep:a][eq:b][fq:c]TR[cn][co][eo][en][bp]C[White doesn't connect. Black should push through 'a' immediately. White corner completely gone and black marked stones are settled. If white blocks at 'b', then black can cut at 'c'.]
;B[eh]TR[fj][el][cl][cm][bn]C[Slow move. Doesn't threaten whit marked group in any way and it is only strengthing an already strong black group.]

C[Overall, I think black is still weak in opening and reading of whole board. Tesuji usually comes in useful in close contact but this game doesn't have a lot of that.

Rex, I suggest you start reading up books on opening and middle game first before going to books on tesuji.

I hope you find the comments are useful - wild.])
