C[Hi,
This is my second game, which I've won, but I thought that I was loosing it, until I counted the points at end of the game.
He has resigned, but Iwould win by 4,5 point.
And I don't know how it has happened.
So I would be greatful if you could clear it up for me.

Thanks for the review.
Paul

[Calvin\]: Hi, Paul.   Actually, you were ahead for most of this game except for a couple parts of the opening where white could have taken the lead.  But you missed a big opportunity to win the game by 40 points.

Key takeways:

1. Stay off the first and second line in the opening.  These are usually endgame sequences.  Exceptions include making a base for a weak group or taking the base of your opponent's weak group.

2. Look for options to tenuki and take big points.

3. Don't overdefend.   Practice reading out the consequences of cuts, and if your reading tells you the cut doesn't work, don't defend it.  Even if you read incorrectly and lose the game, that's okay, because you have to learn to trust your reading to improve it.

4. Push your opponent's weak groups toward your thickness.  The correct direction of play dicates that you should move from the weaker side of a position, not the the stronger one.]

(;B[kq]TR[pp]LB[pj:A][fq:B][jp:C]C[[Calvin\]: The usual ideas here are to play at 'A' to make a san-ren-sei or 'B' to approach white's side.  Black 5 is too close an extension to black's marked stone.  It is better to play at 'C' instead.  See variation.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[qc];B[pc]C[Is it good that I have tried to cut off this stone?

[Calvin\]: It's very good.  In fact, I'd say it's the only move here.  White's invasion is premature.]
;W[pb]
(;B[qd];W[qb];B[nd]LB[cn:A][fq:B][cj:C]C[[Calvin\]: I would prefer to tenuki here.   There are big moves at 'A', 'B', and 'C'.  This contact move seems to help white.]

(;W[oc]LB[md:A]C[[Calvin\]: This is a bad move.  White can hane at 'A' and start building on the left side immediately.  See variation.]
;B[od];W[md]LB[oc:A][od:B]
(;B[rc]LB[me:A][mc:B]C[[Calvin\]:  S17 is an endgame move.   Black can continue the pushing battle at 'A' or cut at 'B'.]
;W[rb]LB[me:A]C[[Calvin\]: S18 is small.  White should play at 'A', reducing black's moyo and building on the top.]
;B[rd];W[sc];B[sd];W[sb];B[me]C[[Calvin\]: The first big move in a while.]
;W[mc]TR[qf]SQ[pb]LB[ld:A]C[This wall is strang and make lots of influations.
Did it helped me in wining the game?

[Calvin\]: Black has an oddly placed stone at R14, but white's position in the top is low.   Also, White 24 should be at A.  I like black.   Making influence is good, but utilizing it can be challenging even for top players.  In the game, black does not utilize this wall effectively and white has a chance to make it worth a lot less.]
;B[le]C[[Calvin\]: This is a great move.];W[pk]LB[qn:A]C[[Calvin\]: It's a good idea for white to invade now.   I would prefer 'A', which is an open area away from white's wall.]

(;B[qj]LB[qn:B][qm:A]C[I decided to attack from the strong wall?
Has this attack been saccessful?

[Calvin\]: This is actually a defensive move so it's improper here.  There are two principles here.  First, to attack you want to surround your opponent's weak stones and push him toward your thickness.  Contact moves are for defense.   A move like 'A' or 'B' would force white toward your wall, which is the correct direction, because it also helps defend the lower side.   Direction of play is dictated by the relative strength and weakness of groups.  You want to move from the weaker side.   See variations for Black 27.]
;W[qn]TR[qf][qj]LB[qk:A]C[I guess that this move was a deffending, so the attack has worked.

[Calvin\]: It's too soon to tell.  However, the two marked stones are too close to black's thickness, so white is gaining here.   White should probably just play at 'A'.]
;B[qo]LB[nq:A]C[[Calvin\]: This contact move just helps white.   Black has a weakness at 'A'.]

(;W[qq]LB[pn:A]C[[Calvin\]: An overplay.   White should stand at 'A'.]
;B[pq]C[I tried to keep him squeezed to the band.];W[qp]
(;B[po]LB[ro:A]C[[Calvin\]: 'A' is the move to separate white.]
;W[ro];B[qr];W[rp];B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[ql];B[pj];W[rr];B[ps]
LB[pr:A]C[[Calvin\]: Connecting at 'A' is better shape here.]

(;W[nl]LB[ok:A]C[[Calvin\]: White's invasion is a success.  Black's positions are overconcenrated both at the top and the bottom.  However, this move is a mistake because black can cut it off.   White should come out solidly at 'A'.]
;B[ok];W[qk]LB[ol:A]C[[Calvin\]: It is vital for white to connect at 'A'.]
;B[ol]C[[Calvin\]: It's huge for black to seal white in like this.]
;W[rj];B[ri];W[sj];B[rh];W[si];B[oi]C[[Calvin\]: The past few moves belong in the endgame.   One of the hardest things to learn for beginners how to notice when your groups are sufficiently settled and it is possible to tenuki.]
;W[rk]C[[Calvin\]: This move is unecessary.];B[fq]C[[Calvin\]: Black takes the lead by being the first to tenuki from the premature endgame play a big point.]
;W[ck]LB[cf:A][dn:B]C[This stone is awkwardly placed.  There is room at 'A' for black to invade.  'B' would be a normal move here.]
;B[cf]LB[fd:A][fo:B][gn:C]C[This move was to prevent him from buiding big moyo on left. But it wasn't a big saccess.
Is the better move, that might give me a better result?

[Calvin\]: This is a natural place to invade, but it is not urgent because black can still get in around 'A'.   Black might consider a moyo-expanding move like 'B' or 'C' instead.]
;W[ce]SQ[ck]LB[ch:A]C[[Calvin\]: As white, I would prefer to play the combined pincer and extension of 'A'.   White's marked stone is just a bit to low and too far for this kick to be effective.]

(;B[ci]LB[df:A][fd:B][fc:C]C[It is basic instinct for black to stand at 'A'.  White still has to defend the corner at 'B' or 'C', so black will have time to make the extension.]

(;W[dj]LB[ej:A][df:B]C[[Calvin\]: White shouldn't contact if he wants to attack.  If playing from this direction, the knight's move of 'A' is better.   'B' is a big move for white, too, because black didn't defend there.]
;B[di];W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[cj]LB[fi:A][gh:B]C[[Calvin\]: This move helps white.  Black should jump out with a move like 'A' or 'B'.  Escape first, instead of making eyes.]
;W[ek]LB[dk:A]C[[Calvin\]: Better to connect at 'A', leaving no forcing moves or peeps.]
;B[ej];W[dk]TR[dj][ck][ek][dp]LB[cn:A]C[The white formation is now stronger than it was before, and black hasn't made much territory.  This is called 'aji keshi', which roughly means erasing your future potential.  It is no longer an option for black to make the double approach at 'A', but if black had omitted the push at C10 and this atari and had just jumped out lightly instead, he would still have the option of playing 'A'.]
;B[eg]SQ[cf]C[[Calvin\]: Black's shape is cramped.  This is because spent two moves trying to protect the marked stone that he treated lightly earlier.  If you decide a stone is not important to defend, stick to that plan and don't defend it.]
;W[fg];B[fj];W[jd];B[jf]LB[fc:A][fk:B]C[Should I be more aggressive here somehow?

[Calvin\]: It's okay.  I would keep this move in reserve in case black has to invade at 'A' later.   For right now, I think turn at 'B' is bigger, though.]
;W[ie]LB[hq:A]C[[Calvin\]: Even though white is making fifth-line territory this way, he is reinforcing black's moyo.   White should consider reducing black, maybe invade at 'A'.]
;B[if];W[hf];B[je]LB[fk:A]C[[Calvin\]: This forcing move is unnecessary.  Save it for a ko threat and tenuki.  Turning at 'A' is large.]
;W[hd]C[[Calvin\]: White should consider whether he really needs to defend here.]
;B[hg];W[gg];B[hh];W[gf]LB[hq:A][fc:B]C[[Calvin\]: The past few moves are small, with White 82 being worth zero points.  The bottom left is the area that is most unstable, because of the potential for white to invade at 'A'.   Note that black can no longer invade at 'B'.  Try to keep your options more open.]
;B[dq]LB[fk:A][fo:B][gn:C]C[[Calvin\]: Again, black gets to make a big move because white is defending too much.   I think the center is more important than the corner in this case, so playing at 'A', 'B' or 'C' may be better.  But this is a big move, too.  In a peaceful game like this, the player who gets to take sente and take more big moves usually wins.]
;W[cq];B[cp]C[[Calvin\]: Slick!   I like it.];W[do];B[cr];W[co]
LB[bq:A]C[[Calvin\]: White has to play at 'A'.];B[bq];W[bp]
LB[gl:A]C[[Calvin\]: Small.  White has to get into black's moyo with something like 'A'.]
;B[cq]LB[fk:A]C[[Calvin\]: Black should not answer the atari.  His profit in the corner is already sufficient.   He should turn at 'A' and make his moyo formidable.]
;W[bo];B[ep];W[eo];B[fo];W[fn];B[go];W[gn];B[gm]C[This move was a mistake, I've clicked on the wrong spot. I wanted on H6. But it wasn't so bad, overall.
Could he think that this is a extension from F10?

[Calvin\]: The misclick is a wasted move.   Black needs to continue the pushing battle. H5 is solid, H6 a little greedy but maybe okay.]
;W[fm]LB[ho:A][hn:B]C[[Calvin\]: White missed a big opportunity here.   The hane at 'A' or simply poking through at 'B' are huge here.  White seems to be only thinking about defending territory.]
;B[hn];W[hm]
(;B[im]LB[gl:A]C[[Calvin\]: Maybe black can just connect at 'A'.  See variation.]
;W[gl];B[io]LB[hl:A]C[[Calvin\]: I think if black ataris at 'A' his lead is substantial.]
;W[gk]LB[il:A]C[[Calvin\]: I don't understand this move.  Certainly white should continue at 'A'?]
;B[gj];W[hj]C[Maybe I should play at H8.

[Calvin\]: H8 is nothing now.  White wouldn't even connect.]

(;B[hi];W[jj];B[ij];W[hk];B[ji]TR[jj][nl]LB[ik:A]C[[Calvin\]: Black should seal white in with A, then white should resign, because the marked stones would have no chance of life.  Black would be 40 points ahead on the board.  By playing this way, white is allowed to reduce black and make the game much closer.]
;W[ik];B[ii];W[jl];B[kj];W[jm];B[jn];W[km];B[kn];W[lm];B[ln]
;W[mm];B[kk]LB[bf:A][kd:B][no:C]C[I don't know why I played here.
Would it be better capturing K10?

[Calvin\]: Yes, capturing is better.   However, black shouldn't just be responding to white's slow moves here.  There is a an endgame concept called "mutual destruction" which is very important.   Black has big sente moves at 'A' and 'B' to reduce white.   Try those first.  Then, maybe, black can pull back at 'C' and be comfortably ahead.]

[Calvin\]: Unfoturnately, on the Internet you will often encounter players who will try some hopeless things in the endgame, hoping you will either make a mistake or lose on time.  This happens in live tournaments, too.  It is rude, and if it bothers you, you can refuse to play such players in the future.   But it's good practice to try to refute their attempts quickly and definitively.]

;W[re];B[qi]C[akitaki has resigned the game.

[Calvin\]: This was a fairly peaceful game with no significant fighting.  Both players made strong groups, but overdefended them.  At one point in the middle game, black was about 40 points ahead, but he made a simple mistake which allowed white to almost catch up.   In the end black won because he was able to tenuki from the slow defensive sequences more often than white.   Both players should study life & death and tesuji and thereby improve their ability to see when defensive moves are necessary.]
