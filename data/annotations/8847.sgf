R: Hi! This game seems to be played at kgs, where my rank would be ~1d. My comments should be treated no more serious.

I think i should review white. (in the future you might want to mark what side needs review)

you can reach me at: goteguru@gmail.com if you have any question.]
;B[pd];W[pq];B[cq];W[dc]C[so, a x-corner opening for a change]
;B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pm];W[nc];B[pf];W[kc]C[R: Black P17 can force this shape a bit overconcentrated and (somewhat) protect the corner. You might consider K17 (nice extension from possible C15 shimari) and in case of P17, you get an ideal shape. 

You dont have to worry about cut. That would be very early as the corner is still open.]
;B[oq]
(;W[or]C[R: Not the best answer. (dont let yourself closed in without fight) see var.]
;B[nq]
(;W[dp]LB[fp:A][nr:B]C[was trying to avoid playing here, but worried about big black influence building a group from the middle-bottom.

R: you can attack san-san by other ways.
(A) is standard joseki if you want to ruin black influence at the bottom. (however i dont think its neccessary)

Maybe one more push at (B) is desirable to stabilize the corner and ruin black's potential a bit.]
;B[pp];W[pr];B[dq]
(;W[cp]LB[ep:A]C[
R: hmm..you dont want to build territory here. You want press black down and get infulence. That was your original plan. Stick to it!
 play at (A) for simple joseki (see var.)];B[ep];W[eq]C[probably shoudl have continued straight if my objective was to try to reduce potential black group...but...

I was once a hane of two stones in this position was a bad move (or at leats i think it was in this position). I was told u shoudl always play 3 stones straight...but perhaps that was for the upper goup here, not the lpower as i thought.
----------------------------
R: well, i'm not sure what you mean. There is one situation i know where E4 hane is bad. See variation.]
(;B[fp];W[bq];B[er];W[cm];B[br]C[

R: you might want to ignore this. Black is strong anyway (only points what he gets).]
;W[bp];B[nr]LB[ce:B][fm:A]C[R: thats large. You should take care of your corner. But your framework is still ok. Maybe (A) and if black answers (B). If black dont answer (black plays B for example) you can invade the bottom.]
;W[ce];B[em];W[dk]CR[gi][fk][em]TR[fg][ei]C[R: Black framework is getting uncomfortably large. Does not seems to be a good plan. (triangles makes 5-8 points each, circles makes 15-20)]
;B[rr];W[rq];B[qr]
(;W[sr]LB[ro:A]C[


R: Well well, nice problem! :) I think (A) can save (a part of) our corner. I'm not sure if white can live here unconditionally without any loss.]
;B[os]
(;W[qq]LB[rs:A]C[

R: you have to keep you eye at (A)... if black plays there you might find yourself in trouble...

You might want to play at (A) yourself (seems to be ko)]
(;B[ne];W[pj]LB[gk:D][no:B][ro:A][hq:C]C[not sure about this either....

could i also invade at k5, k6 or something?

R: I also would like to know the proper way here. :) Maybe a pro answer would be helpful ^-^.

If you ask me, this is a bit too deep. Considering black (A) what seems to be sente and closes up the corner, Q10 is dangerous. Black might want to simply kill it. Even if unsuccessfull, he will get a wall and great center influence. 

IMHO, Target of our invasion should be bottom side. There are more space (if black surround us, he will get less) and there are some ajis (around B and C).

Anyway (D) seems to be playable. Is it neccessary to invade at all? 

If black deffends your framework is same scale (maybe better). If black invades, you can invade bottom side with a nice helping stone at D.]
;B[ph]C[
R: very fortunate. Black is overconcentrated at the top and you are free to run.]
;W[nj];B[ok];W[oj];B[ml];W[ql];B[pk];W[rn]LB[oj:A]C[R: why dont connect? Your plan is sacrifice group A? But why did we play at q10 at the first place?]
;B[qk];W[qm];B[pn];W[rk];B[rj];W[rl];B[qj]LB[gk:A]C[R: Black is now super strong. it would be really hard to invade the bottom side. You might want to ignore the three stones and start a moyo fight around (A). 

After some moves you will surely get some helping stones and you can continue your escape with the triplet if you want. 


Please consider that capturing that three stones would mean 15 points gain at most. If you invade the bottom side after (A) black whole position collapses!]
;W[lj];B[kl]C[
R: this way you will be chased.];W[pb];B[mi]C[

R: take the corner then! 

You offered an exchange. He has chosen three stones. You get the corner. (Same value and we dont have to worry about that weak stones). We are happy. :-)]

C[

R: I would keep up a pressure at (A)];B[fb];W[da];B[jc];W[fc]
LB[kd:A][fk:B]C[R: just continue your attack. Black want to be alive here, It would be very difficult (i think impossible) to kill the whole.  *But* you will get sente. 

Sente would be important, since if black starts to play at (B) he will extend his moyo, PLUS reduce white's moyo PLUS attacking the big center white dragon. That would be very unpleasant.]

;B[ki];W[id]C[R: sure. Ko threat (was it a ko threat? )  was not big enough. Those whities were doomed from the beginning anyway :)]
;B[kj];W[ff];B[fg];W[ef];B[eg];W[df];B[kf];W[dg]C[R: lower side is more important.]
;B[fi];W[fk];B[gm];W[hk];B[jk];W[ik];B[il];W[jp]LB[no:A]TR[eq]
C[R: if you want to invade a moyo like this (what is impossible but your opponent can make some mistakes) you should first identify ajis and place a move according to that. 

Marked stone has some ajis, and your oppoent might be frightened by (A). not enough. 

However if you want to use G3 force, you'd better off with K3 or L3.]

C[couldn't see any ko threat big enough, and so lost the game. :0( but hopefully you can tell me some more reasons as well, and suggest some things to work on.


R: white has less threats. Its a picnic ko for black anyway. 


I think it wasn't a bad game till that last overplay. You might want to focus on territory estimation (not to feel be forced to invade) and it can be helpful to stop sometimes for a second or two and think about what if you *wont* answer to that serious looking move.
You might be able get much more elsewhere.

thx for reading.
