AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,

I want to thank you very much for the time you invest looking through my game.

This one was played on DGS and took 2 month, I gave my opponent 4 stones, because we played other games before and it looked like a proper handicap.

I managed to win in the end,but I'm not to sure about my strategic decisions in the middle game.

Regards,
Andreas.


Hi Andreas,

I've played a little bit on dragon go, under the handle CentralTobi. It's very nice to play postal games of go. 

I will concentrate on the opening strategy. I think the main thing I can teach you is not to be overly agrressive/greedy. You made a huge number of invasions here, not all of which were justified. I hope my comments will make it clearer, but as a general principle, low invasion moves are not to be played in the opening, for there usually are much bigger moves. You finally got out of it to win by overplaying your opponent in some fights, but I think you would have been able to defeat him as well by playing "sounder" moves. Don't hesitate to ask me more if some of my comments are unlcear, or to contradict me if you disagree with something :-)]
PL[W];W[nq]C[I'm not to sure at all about how to approach handicap games. Usually I have a feeling that a have to make unsound move to somehow reduce the gap.


I don't think so, but I'm no specialist of handicap games.]
;B[pn]C[My opponent uses this dedence move a lot.];W[fd]C[In the other games I mostly played low knight move approaches, so I wanted to try something different]
;B[df];W[qf];B[nd];W[fp]C[Kindof same reason .. try something different ...]
;B[dn];W[qk]C[Somehow I expected s7 here, but I'm not sure about my approach from there. maybe M/L17 or attack some corners at some point


Here R8 would be better than R9 I think. This knight jump point from the stone you want to attack is thought to be the weak spot of the enemy stone, just like O3 was the good spot to attack Q4. It puts more pressure on the 2 black stones, which are not settled yet. As you mention, M17 was symmetrically interesting. Other big points are K4 (very big), and split the western side with C10.]
;B[kc]C[This is mistake, too passive. K4, or L4 would have been strong, probably best. It would attack simultaneously your two bottom stones, and moreover release indirectly the pressure on Q4/Q6, as O3 would be itself in danger. This is why a white move at K4 would have been good on last move (but by no means necessary).]
;W[rn]C[Decided to see how my opponent defends there


As black failed to defend these two stones, your idea to attack them is the right one. I am not sure how this can be done best.
In any case, you're destroying most of black's corner prospects here, so black should go for the outside here. Pincering at L4 or so would be good I think, or simply going out with N5 would be fine as well for him.]
;B[oq]C[Of course, you're quite happy that he playes this way, giving you outside strength while his corner is open !]

(;W[qq]C[Up to here you played excellently, but this is your first mistake. You don't need to destroy the corner as it's quite small, due to your s6 stone, and moreover  you're letting your O3 stone down. Imagine he plays O4 ; now your stone is shut down. Thus the f4 stone becomes very lonely, and the bottom side falls under black's influence. Compare this with a white stone on O4 (instead of R3) ; in that case, the bottom side would be under white's influence, thus f4 would not be this lonely. The only positive point in this exchange is that you destroyed the corner territory ... but how big is it ? see the variation for more]
;B[qp]C[Here, it's still time to play 04. It means you have had the R3/R4 exchange, which seems rather neutral.]
;W[pq]C[This moves rings a bell. You're playing a nobi move which does not increase the number of liberties of your group, which seems dangerous. So we have to look for a strong answer by black. Can you see one ? See variation on black next move]

(;B[np]C[So black missed 2 good opportunities, and yet the exchange doesn't seem bad at all for him. You'll have a few points in the corner, and in exchange he'll have saved his corner stones from danger, with sente. 

In general, one must not be greedy in the opening. Territories are far from being enclosed yet, so stealing a few points from the opponent is not the goal ; making large moves to improve one's overall position is much more important. Please compare again the diagramm where white played O4 then K4 to the result of this sequence. I hope I have conviced you that low moves are not a good idea in the opening, while big developping moves are what you have to look for. This would be the most important thing I can teach you.]
;W[or];B[op];W[rp]C[Here you connect your right side stones to your corner, which is interesting, but on the other hand these R9/S6 stones were not threatened yet, so you could have kept this S4 move in reserve. Meanwhile, solving the O3 problem seemed important : with n3 for instance. But your shape would still remain far from ideal.]
;B[nr];W[pr];B[mq]C[Ok, so black decided to cut your corner from the bottom side, which is very big as he's got a big influence while your f4 stone looks very lonely, but he lost sente. Maybe he could have played n3 instead of O2 and then played elsewhere if he wanted sente, but this seems ok. Once again, black's position is better now than before your R3 move.]
;W[jq]LB[ip:A]C[Trying to reduce his options with his thickness here

Defending your f4 stone is indeed very important, this is the biggest area right now. As he is this strong, you should not approach too close, though. So I would recommend A instead of K3, to prevent black from separating your two stones, and the higher move makes the possibility to escape in the center even better. But your idea was the right one.]
;B[jp]LB[hp:A][hq:B]C[This is a very bad move by black. A general principle says that attaching an enemy stone makes it stronger, and black wants your stones to stay weak, to attack them. So black should have played at A or B, to separate.]
;W[ip];B[io];W[hp]LB[iq:A]C[I think I would have played rather A here, as it would connect more strongly the k3 stone, while the f4 stone would be quite strongly connected anyway to J3/J4. But your move is ok.]
;B[ho];W[jo]LB[go:A]C[This seems dangerous. Maybe you could have left this cut hanging, and played simply at A ? Then black would have had to connect at k5 for instance, allowing you to go out at, say, G7, making his influence a lot less interesting.

I'm not sure what the aim of your cut is. You're cutting a very strong group (04 etc), so you have no hope of attacking it anyway.]
;B[kp]
(;W[ko]C[see variation for the shape move];B[lo];W[km]LB[im:A]
[gp:B]TR[ho][io]C[Here you save your cutting stones. So black's O4 group is cut ... but it's alive anyway. So there's only the marked stones left to attack. What if he plays g5 and then connects to D6, or (even better) jumps out with A, threatening to play at B, which would be extremely severe to your bottom group ?

Cutting is a very interesting weapon in go, but my advice would be to cut only when you separate two weak parts. When one part is already alive, cutting makes a lot less sense.]
;B[lm]C[Black defends his strongest group, which is the wrong way.]
;W[im]LB[jm:A]TR[km][jo][ko]SQ[ho][io]C[Table shape and looking what happens

Nice shape indeed ; you could also have made nide shape with A, but your move is more severe on the two "square" stones. Nice one.]
;B[jn]LB[go:A]C[Of course, black had to play A again, not this]
;W[kn];B[ln];W[jm]C[Black's sequence is a huge mistake, he makes his super strong group even stronger, which is of no use. Meanwhile your cutting stones become strong, which is good for you.]
;B[gn]LB[go:A]C[A was the shape, to threaten your bottom group.]
;W[cj]C[Splitting this side is the last big point from the opening, so I like your move. You could also have played it at C12 to attack the two corner stones in relation with F16.

I am a bit worried for your bottom group, not sure how alive it is yet, but there seems to be no efficient way to improve it.]
;B[ck]C[Once again, black attaches a weak stone, bad idea.]
;W[dk];B[cl];W[ej]LB[di:B][bj:A][dj:C]TR[cj][dk]C[Not sure . I suppose I'm trying to make some shape again.


This is ok. If the top left corner was occuppied by white, you would rather have conneted with B, to prevent a move at A from your opponent, but here it's no use. Connecting at C would make your group heavy, which you don't want. To play lightly (which is a good idea since you are surronded by black, and not far away from your center group which floats and can still be attacked) you might even not have strongly connected, for instance made a move further towards the center. Hard to decide.]
;B[eq]C[Ok, you didn't defend, so black attacks. Hi move seems very strange, but I am unable to provide any better one. Strange shape. In any case, you are barely alive here.]
;W[cq]LB[fn:B][fq:A]TR[fp][hp][ip][jq]C[This attack felt kindof dangerous for my marked group. I felt like I don't have much choice then try something

Indeed, even by defending your group, I'm not sure to what extent you are alove. Here any move at the bottom would kill you, so you had to defend at A, aiming at an attachment at B to go out or live.]
;B[dr]LB[dq:A];W[cp];B[co];W[cr]C[D2 was not a good move by black ; but even with it, black can still play D3 for instance, with an awfull shape, but your bottom group would be dead already, and your corner group would only live in gote. So the corner invasion was definitely too dangerous.]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[bo];W[dq];B[er];W[ep]C[Fortunately black gives you some chance to kill three stones, so you might still save both groups. But I think you should remember that invading near a weak group is "always" a bad idea, unless you want to sacrify one group.]
;B[do];W[fq];B[aq];W[ar];B[cs];W[ap];B[bs];W[br];B[ao];W[ds]
;B[es];W[fr];B[aq]C[Well at least a Ko for my group there.

Indeed. Unfortunately, you don't have a real ko threat, so black will probably capture on next move (which is huge, given that you bottom group might become dead (or living in gote) if you lose the ko]
;W[cc]LB[oc:A]C[You had two threats rather big, either your move or A. In any case, black should capture (more than 30 points plus your bottom group which would be no more alive for sure (living in gote I'd say).]
;B[dc];W[ap];B[rq];W[fs]C[Ok, this is indeed bigger than the other corner]
;B[rr];W[cd];B[ce];W[bk]TR[cl][dn][gn]C[Noticed that these groups looked vulnerable now. Probably should have omitted c16 though

Yes, instead of C16, B16 would be better. Black's best answer (locally) would still be C15, so your group would have had more liberties, this more life potential.]
;B[bl];W[bj];B[dl];W[el];B[em];W[fm];B[fn];W[gm];B[hm];W[hl]
C[Basic plan is to build up a wall outside. Just one little problem ... the d14 group is kindof in the way so it's maybe not that effective

Indeed, your influence is not optimal, but at least it greatly helps your F16 stone which was very lonely before. Had you played B16 instead of C16, living in the corner would have left the black group without eyes, so you might even have been able to attack it.]
;B[hn];W[bm]LB[am:A][cm:C][bn:B]C[Here you overlooked that black could double atari I guess ; but even if you had connected, black would not have been forced to make an extra move to live. Indeed, he can play A here, and then B and C are miai to give him 2 eyes.]
;B[al];W[cm];B[fl];W[gl];B[ek];W[dj];B[fk]LB[fj:A][gk:B]C[Of course, A or B would have been better than this black move]
;W[gj];B[gk];W[hk];B[eo];W[fo];B[fj];W[fi];B[el];W[hi];B[bn]
;W[am]C[Well seki at the moment I think. Don#t know right now about other lines]
;B[dm]LB[lp:A]C[Sometimes through the game I was contemplating playing at A, but I never actually did

Unfortunately, A doesn't work.]
(;W[db];B[eb]LB[bb:A]C[I think here you can live in ko with A, and that's the best you can hope.]
;W[be];B[bf];W[ad]
(;B[bb]C[Nice move by black. I would have thought C18 killed, but apprently not 'see variation). This black move kills though]
;W[cb];B[bc];W[ec]
(;B[ed]C[Too bad for black who made a great move in the corner, but failed to find the roght move here. See variation.]

SQ[hk][hl][im][jm][km]C[the play in the upper left was probably wrong, considered my outside groups .. but I didn't find a better plan

Well, had you managed to live in the corner, it would have been ok, for his corner group would have been under attack. But you obtained this influence in sente anyway, so there's no regret to be had.]

[bs][cs][ds][es][gs][hs][is]C[Probably an overplay. I was hoping to get away with it.

I'm kindof not sure about the count here.

White.
Lower left: ~23
Right ( quite vulerable ): ~12
middle: ~10
top left: not sure maybe 5 more ?!?
so: ~50 ?!?

Black:
top right: ~18
lower right:     ~29
top left: 9
so: ~56

I'm not sure about that count. Looks not so bad, but I didn't feel that confident still so I attacked the top right corner

It's very hard to make a count, usually one only consider points which are really there, here you count much more. I think overall black is still very slightly ahead, but you've closed the gap quite much already. The right side in particular is far from alive, so counting points here is overly optimistic. A move at A by black would make both parts under severe attack.]

;W[of]LB[ph:C][qh:D][pi:B][qi:A]C[Well I made life. Now trying to protect my right side

Indeed, objectively you should have done it before invading I think. Note that here, with such a black strength, any splitting move on the side is still good for black, making your life quite hard.]
