Hi Hanscom,

I'll be reviewing your game. I know you played white, so I'll try to focus my review there, but certainly there are things that can be learned from black's play, too, so I'll mention some things there as I go along.

I'm yearofglad on KGS.

Thanks for letting me review your game!

Todd];W[pp];B[dd];W[qn]C[Hello, and thank you for your review!
Though KGS has me at 13k I am actually MUCH weaker than that so please be kind. :)

R6: I know the shimari here is wrong but I was trying to protect my corner and make a base from the start so that I could fight a territory based game.

---

In an even game (no handicap), this is fine - it's just as good to protect your corner as it is to approach someone else's corner. However, you're right in this case - in a handicap game, when you're playing white, you typically need to be more aggressive than this move.]
;B[pj];W[gp]TR[kp][lp][jq][kq][lq]C[This move tells your opponent, "I want to make some territory along the bottom side to go with the lower right corner." It's ok if you have a stone somewhere between, like any of the triangled spots.

However, it's far too dangerous without any stones there, and too passive for a handicap game. A move like F3 is more typical.]
;B[fq]C[This is one of the key points for the corner.];W[gq]
C[Okay, so here you're emphasizing the bottom and right. You're pushing in the right direction if that's your intent, so no problems, given the situation so far.]
;B[gr];W[hr]TR[fc][nc][cf][ci][cj][ck][cn]C[II wouldn't bother responding to this, probably. There are more valuable moves elsewhere on the board.

Make a move elsewhere - don't feel beholden to respond to black. There are plenty of moves that are as valuable (or more valuable) than this one and that will require black to respond. As long as each move you make forces black to respond, you can return to H2 at a time when it's more appropriate, i.e., it's more valuable relative to other moves on the board.

Any of the triangled locations on the board are good, although to make sure black responds, probably stick to the corner approaches.]
;B[gs];W[kq]C[Good - I'd probably play this at M3 instead of L3, but the idea is good.]
;B[qq]C[R3: Here is probably where I should have resigned since, as the proverb says, "If you lose four corners resign", but I decided to change tactics at this point and try for influence and make a play for the center.

---

Resign? No way. If you consider this corner "lost" because of the 3-3 invasion, then that means you can just as easily take one of the upper corners with a similar 3-3 invasion; in fact, such an invasion would be easier because black has yet to really support those stones.

Not that I'm recommending a 3-3 invasion - I'm just pointing out that to consider that you've lost all 4 corners in this game because of a 3-3 invasion is a bit much.

Also, when you resign, you don't get to learn anything else from the rest of the game. If you resign at this point, what will you have learned? At double-digit kyu, your goal should be to play games and learn, not necessarily win (although winning is nice).

Finally, in double-digit kyu games, it's typically a battle decided by who makes the fewest mistakes. If you were playing a 4 or 5 kyu, sure, you've already lost - your position is unrecoverable. But in a game like this, you have to expect that the opponent will make mistakes along the way. Learn to capitalize on those mistakes.

A resignation on move 12 in a double-digit kyu games serves no purpose.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[pr];W[or];B[ps];W[os];B[qr];W[dn]TR[oq]
C[Here, as you see later, you need to protect against the cut at P3, especially since you're working towards a large territory on the bottom. Don't abandon it when it's almost completed. (I do, however, understand the feeling of urgency in that you don't want black to do whatever he wants.)

Also, I think D6 should be at C6 or C7. If you're truly focusing on center territory, then playing on the 4th line as you did is fine - it emphasizes the center more than the side. However, there's really no reason to give away the left side (or the top) this early in the game. Playing entirely for center territory is not a particularly great strategy.]
;B[fo]C[Question: What do you think black's intent is with a move like F5?

Is it to try to creep into your lower middle? If so, it's very slow and not very aggressive.

If it's to try to protect the corner, well, it's pretty far away from the corner to do that.

If it's to attack D6, it's ok, but a pincer would be better.

So, ultimately, it doesn't do much of anything. If I were you, I'd take this opportunity, after a wasted/slow move like F5, to strengthen your white stone at D6.]
;W[go]C[Here, what if you had let black play G5 at some point and then responded at H5? You'd still keep black out of your territory with a loss of 1 or 2 points. Strengthening that white stone is more important, with a stone around C9 (particularly if that white stone was on the C-line.)]
;B[fp]C[I feel like I should probably have played C5 or B5 here so as to threaten to erase some of Black's territory before builing my wall on the 6th line.]
;W[fn]C[I'm not sure what you're going for here. I think maybe you're trying to connect your white stone on the left to your lower middle group. I wouldn't bother, especially since there's the obvious cut at G6. Just strengthen that white stone by making a base on the left side.]
;B[cn];W[dm];B[cm];W[cl];B[bl];W[ck];B[bk];W[cf]C[All this seems pretty good for white. You give up a little on the side but keep black nice and low. I might play C13 instead of C14.]
;B[ce]C[Here, black is probably better off extending along the upper side instead of approaching your stone. Black's move here is a little unusual, especially with the black supporting stone at Q16 - an extension in that direction brings that stone into play.]
;W[df];B[ee]TR[fc][fd]C[The typical move for black here is F16 or F17.]
;W[be]TR[gc][hc][ic][jc][kc][lc][mc][nc]C[This move is too slow. It doesn't accomplish much, particularly at this point in the game. Picture that vs. playing a white stone at any of the triangle locations - see all the additional damage that can be done to black? Here, you're pushing for a point, maybe 2?]
;B[bd];W[de];B[cd];W[ef]C[I can't read it out far enough, but why not cut at E16? Not sure about that, but this move as is really just encourages black to solidify along the top, gaining territory along the top. Granted, you gain potential territory in the center, but the top and sides are, as you know, worth more than the corners in terms of how many stones it takes to encircle an equivalent number of points.]
;B[oq]C[P3: This happens to me a lot. I need some pointers on when to defend my cutting points I think. In a previous game I lost half my territory to these types of moves.

---------

When I was around 10 - 15kyu, that was my biggest problem, too. I'd always see better players seem to leave groups open to cutting and move on to other things, then coming back to repair cutting points before they got cut. It's a tough skill.

Here, though, since you're focusing on the bottom middle - that's where most of your points are - you've got to defend that way back when it first became a cutting point (and black could've cut it earlier than he did now - he waited longer than I would've).

It's easy to get caught up in what you're doing at any given point (which led to end of this game, too). But look at a move even like E14 that you made - what does that accomplish? How many points does it really get you vs. the problems that black's P3 cause?

In general, defend your cutting points early. Once a group is nice and sound, you don't have to worry about it. Here, the entire game the cut at P3 should've been in the back of your head. Play solid, make strong, solid shapes, and you won't have to worry about them later. Plus, you'll be able to confidently use them to attack.]
;W[nq];B[op]
(;W[po]C[Here, I think you're trying to have it both ways - you're trying to save both groups. I understand that ultimately you were able to, but that was mostly due to poor play by black and allowing you to connect. I would've played O4 instead (look at the variation previous) and just sacrificed those stones.

One problem with trying to learn from double-digit kyu games is thinking, for example, "Well, I was able to save those stones on the right-hand side, so Q5 was the right move." Better players will punish those moves; it's better to make the /correct/ move rather than an incorrect move that you can simply get away with because of your opponent's weak play.]
;B[nr];W[mr];B[ns];W[mq];B[oo];W[qm]C[This is tough - this group is in a tough spot. I probably would've opened it up more with P6, but it's pretty dire anyway.]
;B[qk];W[om];B[mo];W[mm];B[km];W[ln]C[Good - this is exactly right - try to cut those black stones in two while threatening to connect back to your white group on the bottom.]
;B[ms]C[This move by black is really wasted. I'm not sure why they decided to make this move rather than continuing the attack on your white group.]
;W[jo];B[kn];W[ko];B[lp]C[Here, black should've cut at M5, keeping your weak group isolated.]
;W[lq]TR[mq][nq][mr]C[And likewise, you should've taken this opportunity to connect at M5. Sure, you might lose the three marked stones, but if you don't connect, you're looking at potentially losing a much larger group.]
;B[kp]C[Again, here, black misses the opportunity to finish the cut and uselessly pushes ahead.]
;W[jp];B[mn];W[lo];B[mp];W[lm];B[ll];W[ml];B[lk];W[kl]C[L8: I played here because I have the ladder

----

Yes, this is a good cut.];B[jl];W[kk];B[kj];W[jk];B[im];W[mk]
C[I don't like this play particularly. It allows black to play M10 - in fact, it forces black to do so - which really removes another potential cutting point for you. Meanwhile, N9 doesn't really do anything for YOU - it simply forces black into a stronger position.]
;B[lj];W[mj];B[mi];W[ni]TR[fc][gc][hc][ic][jc][kc][lc][mc]C[I'm not sure why, after cutting at L8, you're not continuing to work on that group. 

Also, what does this move really gain you? Again, compare with moving at any of the marked areas. Those stones are HUGE compared to this. (Again, I understand it's easy to get caught up in the current fight - don't be afraid to back away, say, "That group is settled, where can I cause the most trouble NOW?")]

;B[gm];W[gl];B[ik];W[jj]
(;B[ls]C[Not sure I understand this move from black.];W[jr]
C[I see here that you're protecting against the cut at K3. I wouldn't worry about it - if black cuts, you should be fine. (See the variation at white 97.)

Don't instinctively respond to black's every play. If it doesn't require a response, don't make one.]
;B[ks];W[fe]C[F15: My thought here is to start a leaning attack on the group in the top left so that I can later use my thickness at the top to help me breakthrough at M11.

------

This is just too slow. There's still the huge area on the upper side that nobody is paying attention. You have room there to play on the 3rd line and be guaranteed t a 2-space extension in one direction.]
;B[ed]C[Likewise, black probably shouldn't care about his one stone at E15. He'd be better off playing in that huge area.]
;W[fd];B[fc];W[hd];B[kd];W[kh]C[Ask yourself why you were so focused on cutting here. What good will cutting at M11 accomplish if you were able to do so? Maybe capture those 4 stones worth a total of 8 points? Even a 3-3 invastion at R17 will be worth more than that.

Plus, a move like this guarantees you won't be able to cut. You're basically inviting black to play M11.]
;B[lh]C[Or a move like this, which isn't as good but (kind of) accomplishes the same goal.]

;B[ke];W[pi]C[Here, a stronger player would almost certainly punish you with the cut at L13. Either way you atari the stone leads to problems.]

(;B[qi];W[pg];B[pf]
(;W[of]C[Why atari the stone at Q12 and then not capture it when given the opportunity? Had you captured, you could've potentially taken the other three black stones - almost assuredly.]

[po][qo][pp][pq]C[Hanscom [15k?\]: Hey, Thanks
raptorx3x [15k\]: thx

O10: Should have seen it coming, but I was too focused on my attack on the upper center. Even if I had won the center I still would have lost by a huge margin but I was thinking that after I secured the top I might be able to make 3-3 invasions on the top right and lower left.

Thanks Again!

---

There is MAYBE room for an invasion in the lower left. The upper right is probably doable thanks to the marked stones providing a little help.

Ultimately, yes, white is behind. However, losing a 4-stone group doesn't spell the end for white, and again, if I were in your shoes I probably wouldn't have resigned. You still have the potential for a very large center area if you shore up some of the marked cuts.

Final thoughts:

If I had to give 3 pieces of advice based on this game:

1) Don't be so quick to respond to what your opponent is doing. If their move doesn't require an urgent response and/or isn't worth many points, particularly in the beginning of the game, don't bother - go do something else, particularly if that "something else" is something that requires your opponent to respond in kind. As long as you keep making moves that maintain sente by requiring your opponent to respond, you're free to return to your opponent's original move and make a response at the appropriate time.

2) Look for large moves. This relates almost directly to (1) above, but even when you had the freedom to play anywhere, either because your opponent made a move that didn't require a response or because you decided to ignore your opponent, the upper side in this game was left along for far too long.

3) Don't be afraid to let your opponent capture a few stones - if you're giving a group up for dead, it doesn't mean it isn't useful any longer. Use the threat of connecting to it to further your position. This piece of advice is particularly about the square-marked stones in the lower right - again, here, you managed to escape with them but against a better player this wouldn't have been possible.

Last piece of advice - keep playing! Keep learning!])
