I asked for other DGS players to look over the game and let me know if I should resign, several said that there were significant opportunities for both players to gain ground. I knew that was the case for black (and he eventually took my right corner,) but I didn't see any significant opportunities for me..

kklim> slightly under hand at this moment, it mean nothing. your competitor may have wrong move and you can turn the situation, no to mention endgame still lot of fighting yet. do not give up.]
