C[[DP Hello there - you made the following comment so I will look at the game in this light. I hope you find the comments useful\]
I felt this game messy. Too heavy and didn't find a clear line of development. Could you help me clarify? Many thanks
[DP Key moves are:
29 when the empty triangle causes problems top left
41 as you correctly identified - strategically you needed to reduce W / increase B influence rather than go for territory
77 during the fight in the bottom right, where you protect your stones directly rather than attacking his weak group to give yourself strength
You need to put a little less emphasis on territory, and work more on your thickness (influence).  You handled W thickness well, staying away from it, but when you had your own it didn't get used to your advantage.  Opening chapters of Attack and Defense cover this quite well, so might be worth getting a look at that book\]]
;B[pd]C[palkarg [11k\]: Thank you for your time  reviewing this game
[DP No probs - I enjoy doing them\]];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]
;W[dj]LB[ip:A];B[jp]LB[ip:A][hq:B]C[I feel K4 is a good stretch but feel also it leaves B open for invasion. How do you deal with B when it happens ?
Otherwise is A easier and stronger than K4 ?
[DP K4 is the correct extension here - A would be too narrow. Note you could also play a double kakari at C6, or your own san-ren-sei at Q10. See variation for the invasion details (check out Attack and Defense if you've got a copy too).  Note in particular that ladders feature heavily in this invasion, as does timing - if W invades immediately you could tenuki\]]

(;W[pj];B[qm]LB[ql:A]C[A better ?
[DP It's an interesting move which builds a framework with K4 earlier, and makes F5 a big move.  I think R7 is in the right place.  Other options would be K16, F17 or  C6\]]
;W[qf];B[qh]C[Idea was a pincer for both W stones, is it overplay ?
[DP Feels a bit early. O16 would be a nice response preparing for the invasion\]]
;W[pf]
(;B[nd]C[[DP After W R14 you need to act immediately if you want to use R12, by jumping out into the centre at P12\]]
;W[ph];B[fc]C[[DP Good!  You left R12 alone, although it must have been a temptation!\]]
;W[jd]
(;B[lc]LB[ic:A]C[A better to extend F17 base ?
I played M17 because O16 was high and the corner was a bit open.
[DP Better to jump into the centre with F15, reducing influence of W san-ren-sei. Corner is still open - see variation - although W won't do this since you could then link to R12.  He might reduce your corner with S16 though, which leaves you overconcentrated\]]

(;W[jc];B[cc]C[[DP Problem with this move is that W can make a wall to work ideally with K16 and K17.  Better would be the one-space jump to F15\]]

(;W[ec];B[eb]C[What was the correct way to play ?
[DP Very much so.  W made a mistake and you take full advantage to start with\]]
;W[db];B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[cb];B[bc];W[bb]
(;B[bd]C[[DP Aha - an empty triangle.  Causes you no end of problems with the wall W now builds!\]]

(;B[ab]C[[DP Still just about possible to escape with B14, but once you go this direction the W wall is inevitable\]]

LB[hd:H][le:B][qe:C][rj:D][om:A][cn:G][fo:E][cq:F]C[Here I was a bit lost. I didn't kbnow where to play  so I went for territory at N3.
Could you briefly comment the different moves I looked at ?
[DP OK, well strategically you should now be looking at reducing the huge W influence from that wall.  Play away from thickness, so my favourite would be E.  It's the junction point between your two frameworks and so is a vital point. So, E 10 points. A would build your framework, but it is smaller than W one, and leaves E open, so 7 points. G invades the framework from a safe distance, and makes E hard to play, but you will come under strong attack with the C5,D6,E5 sequence, so 6 points.  B gets you into the centre and separates the W groups - 5 points. F invites C4 in response and W builds a huge framework, so 3 points there. Both C and D are small and let W do exactly what he wants - 2 points. H is  far too close to the W powerbase - 1point. N3 goes for a tiny bit of territory and lets W do what he pleases again, so only 1 point there too, I'm afraid\]]
;W[eq]C[[DP W lets you off the hook here!\]];B[fp]C[[DP A good response to E3\]]
;W[qp]
(;B[qq]LB[pp:A]C[Not sure. A better ? Corner or moyo, felt afterwards moyo would have represented more points ?
[DP Yes, A would work better with existing stones\]];W[pp];B[op]

(;B[om]C[[DP Go for the double hane at O5 - puts a lot of pressure on W. See variations\]]
;W[no];B[np];W[pn];B[pm];W[nm];B[rp]C[[DP Rescuing Q7 stones should be higher priority than corner for you now\]]
;W[ro];B[qo];W[po];B[qn];W[rq]C[[DP Oops. W splits your groups and pretty much annihilates your corner\]]
;B[rr]LB[rn:A]C[A better ?
[DP Doesn't matter too much\]];W[sp];B[ok]C[[DP Good - they need saving!\]]
;W[qk];B[nl]LB[do:A]C[A seemed intersting but the Q7 group looked still very weak ?
[DP Dead right - you must sort out the Q7 group first, so good move\]]
;W[mm];B[ml];W[lm];B[ll];W[kl]
(;B[lj]LB[nj:A]C[Or A ?
[DP L9 much better\]];W[dn];B[km]C[[DP Excellent move - I think it actually kills the W stones if you follow it through\]
At this point what was the best strategy ?
[DP Attack, as you did\]
Was there a way to invade D13 moyo ?
[DP Reduction not invasion better, with a move around F6\]]
;W[kn];B[jm];W[jn]
(;B[jl]C[[DP This is another key point.  Extension to J7 better\]]
;W[in]C[[DP Excellent move by W\]];B[kk];W[ip]C[[DP W weak group has escaped, become strong, and is now attacking you.  Strategically you were too concerned about R7 group weakness - you could have made it stronger by attacking the W group instead\]]
;B[iq];W[kp];B[kq];W[jo];B[jq];W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[cq]C[Overplay ?
[DP Allows W to wall off left hand side\]];W[dq];B[cp];W[co]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fr];B[gr]LB[ar:A]C[A better ?
[DP No, you must stop him eating underneath your territory, so your G2 move is best.  And so yes, C3 was an overplay, since it couldn't live after that\]]
;W[bp];B[hp]C[[DP Small - how about S16 if you want some points, or an extension from your centre group?\]]
;W[bq]C[[DP B corner already dead, so you get a free move here!\]]
;B[io]C[[DP Small again - look for reducing moves against W moyo. Now might be the time for G16\]]
;W[ho];B[hn];W[ip];B[go];W[hm];B[gn];W[im];B[qe]C[[DP Good, this gets solid territory for you, and now is the time in the game to secure some\]]
