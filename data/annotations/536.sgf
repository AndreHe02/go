;B[pd];W[cp];B[dd];W[pp];B[hq]LB[eq:a]C[This approach move, while not  unheard of, is at least unconventional
"a" is the most common.];W[cm]LB[eq:a]C[This is a slack reponse to a slack move.  "a" is good for white too.]
;B[eq];W[cf]C[d14 would be better];B[fd];W[ci]C[White's position on the left side is too low.]
;B[nq]C[black is also taking a position that
is too close to the edge.];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq];B[kq];W[je]LB[hc:a]
[hd:b][jd:c][nc:d]C[The top side is the right place,
but K15 is too far outside the
action.   A or B would be more
common.  C or D might also be ok.]
(;B[id]C[taking advantage of white's weak approach is a good idea.]
;W[qf];B[pf]C[A good choice for black.];W[qh];B[ld];W[pg];B[of]
;W[og];B[nf];W[jn]C[Out in the middle of nowhere. What
could this move be trying to do?];B[jd]C[Black doesn't need to further reinforce his incredibly dominant position on the top side.]
;W[go];B[en]LB[eo:a]C[A bit too far.  "a" would be better.]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[fo];B[dp];W[eo];B[do];W[dn]C[I didn't understand why black didn't try c6?

Black has too many cutting points
in the neighborhood to play aggressively.  After C6 D7 C5 D3
what?];B[cq];W[co];B[dq];W[em]LB[jj:a]C[this is unnecessary - the black stone
is already cut off.  Better to play
a really big move such as "a"];B[hg]C[Did he have to play h13?

H13 is actually pretty timid.
Again, something like "a" is called
for.  At this point, the game is
clearly to stake out as much of
the center as possible.  One can
only do this with broad strokes.];W[ih];B[kh]C[this line of play is somewhat silly.  Both players are squabbling overa small area, whle huge areas are unclaimed.]
;W[ff]LB[ig:a]C[wrong approach. "a" would be better.];B[df]
;W[dg];B[ce]C[Here I guess c13 instead of b14 had saved a lot of trouble...?]
;W[bf];B[eg];W[dh]LB[ef:a][fg:b]C[atari at "a" then "b" first]
;B[fg];W[fi];B[pl]C[good choice];W[qm];B[ql];W[rd];B[qc];W[qr]
C[Am I too conserned about eye space for my top and bottom groups?

Perhaps ought to have played at o8 or something making outside wall?

(5 last moves)];B[rm]C[poor choice.  this sequence
will end in gote for black, with white stronger as a result.  Running toward the center would be better.]
;W[rn];B[pm];W[qn];B[hj];W[hi];B[gj];W[gi];B[jj];W[ji]LB[ig:a]
C[This begin to feel like I have lost the game a long time ago.

So I started trying some desperate things...];B[ij];W[ki];B[kj]
;W[li];B[mm];W[mo];B[on];W[ll];B[kl];W[lm];B[km];W[kn]C[Trying to get an attack against both k10 and q8 groups...]
;B[lk];W[ml];B[mk];W[nl];B[nk];W[ok];B[mi]LB[ol:a]C[big mistake.  Black should cut at "a"]
;W[oj];B[nm]C[black sees to be making sure all
his dead stones are connected together.];W[ol];B[om];W[no];B[oi]
;W[qj];B[ii];W[mg]C[Hm I was to lazy to re read a sequense that I thought

worked before j11 was played...];B[ng];W[jg];B[hh];W[lj]C[not a good choice.]
;B[jh];W[lh];B[ig];W[nh];B[lg]LB[ni:a][oh:b][mh:c]C[better to connect at a then cut at b or c]
;W[ni];C[
Both players are too fixated on making incremental extensions  from existing positions.  Look
for the bigger picture and how  control the big areas first.]
