C[K: Hi! This is a game that I played in a tournament a week ago. I really enjoyed this game and I put a lot of effort into it, and I would like some advice.

I am mostly interested:
1) in the opening, the botton-right joseki.
2) the attack at move 41 and how to handle it.
3) the shoulder hit at move 113, and how I could have handled it (if possible) without losing a lot of points

Thank you!
Andrea];B[dp];W[pq];B[pd];W[dd];B[po];W[pl];B[qj]C[K: this move is new to me, I didn't feel right to protect the corner at o4 and there was no good way to link my two stones together.

klin: W can play at R7 or O4];W[pn]C[klin: Q6 unusual];B[oo]
;W[qo];B[qn]TR[qm]C[K: is r7 better? klin: No. W responds with R4 is better.
klin: B R6 should R4.];W[qp];B[pm];W[on];B[ql]C[klin: B R8 should P7 first.]
;W[om];B[qm];W[no]C[K: I feel quite good with that corner, even if there is a huge aji in the 2 captured stones. It may have turned much worse.

klin: W good.];B[gq];W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[cj];W[cp];B[co];W[cq]
;B[dq]C[klin: B D3 at D5 or B5 better.];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[ic]C[K: I wanted to go in the corner, now, but I didnt' want to leave an extension to black, even if ti strenghten him. Was that a good choice?

klin: G17 OK];W[gc];B[ie];W[pb];B[qc];W[iq]TR[kb]C[K: this tenuki was bad, I discovered later... fixing the shape in the upper group was probably better. L18, maybe?

klin: L18 OK];B[mc];W[md];B[lc];W[ld];B[nb];W[mb]C[klin: W N18 should P17]

;B[ce];W[bc];B[ef];W[ge]C[K: here I tried not to repeat the same mistake of leaving a weak group.]
;B[jp];W[ip];B[jo];W[jq]C[K: Any way not to be splitted? The aji is activating.

klin: K3 at L2 better];B[lp];W[lq];B[mp]C[klin: B N4 can ply at N3]
;W[mq];B[np];W[op];B[nq];W[io];B[jm];W[in];B[lm];W[hl];B[gn]
;W[hm]C[klin: H7 at J7 better];B[jk];W[di];B[ed];W[de];B[df]
;W[dc];B[ee];W[gg]TR[nf][di][hl]C[K: here I decided to let Black cut me in E17, to strenghten the center, and hopefully connect all the groups later, or at least let them support each other.

klin: W still should connect.  G13 no good];B[ci];W[ij];B[ec]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[bf];B[bg];W[be];B[eh];W[jj];B[kj];W[ki];B[lj]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pi];B[pj];W[of]C[K: is it better to leave the forcing move for later?]
;B[pe];W[eo]TR[fm][go][eq]C[K: I am very proud of this move, I read for a long time to check if it worked, I am still not totally sure.]
;B[go]C[klin: B should E5 connect. No big deal.];W[fm];B[do]
;W[el];B[hh]TR[gc][ge]C[K: here I did a mistake that make me lose the top 2 stones. Any suggestion on how to handle this shoulder hit?

klin: The big mistake was made earlier (G14).];W[gh];B[hi];W[gi]
;B[hj];W[ik];B[gj];W[hg];B[ig];W[ih];B[hf]C[klin: B H14 at E10, W in bigger trouble.
No comment beyond thispoint.];W[fj];B[fi];W[jg];B[if];W[gk]
