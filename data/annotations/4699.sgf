C[H: Hello, I played Black here.
(Small plea: please use "A/B/C" etc. instead of "W11/Q15" etc. in your review. That makes it much more readable for me.)

This game is quite typical for my recent encounters, so any hint will be of much help.


Thanks to the reviewer in advance!

Hi my comments will be precided by ISK.];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[de];W[fd]
(;B[cd]LB[ch:A]C[H: The idea was to extend around A to have a stable position.

ISK: This is a slow move. Proper Joseki please see the other paths of play.]

(;W[nc]LB[cc:A]C[ISK: This is white mistake.  he should have pressed down at "A".]

(;B[lc]LB[ic:A][kd:B][pf:C][qf:D]C[H: This move seemed to have two goals: Putting pressure on the w stone, and if he tries to flee, I can do the 2-space extension to A.

ISK: I don't like this move.  It can give a weak group or a crampped group in the future.I would just play B, so you can cramp white's style.  Or C Or even D.]
;W[ne];B[ic]LB[pf:A]C[ISK: This is a mistake.  White can punish you with A.]

(;W[cc];B[ch];W[qc];B[pc]C[H: I decided to let him run on the thrid line in exchange for a wall facing the middle and facing the two white stones.

ISK: Good block.];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[pf];W[qf];B[pg];W[eq]
;B[ck]LB[le:B][cl:A]C[H: This should prevent his extension around A.

ISK: This is not important right now.  "B" is more important as it puts pressure on white's stone.  And makes it so it doesn't crap you r stones.]
;W[ld]
(;B[kd]LB[kc:C][le:B][ck:A]C[H: I wasn't sure, what to do here. My strategy should have been, to chase him from left and right in order to build up territory, but I missed the point to put him under pressure, didn't I ?

ISK: Yes, you're right your A should have been "B".  But here the right response is "C", as it doesn't help white make shape.  This helps white make shape.]
;W[le]
(;B[mf]C[ISK: Greedy mistake.  This is too late now, you can't attack white when you have your own weakness hear by.  First fix your mistakes.]

(;W[kf]LB[ke:A]C[ISK: This is a mistake by white.  He should have forced at A first.]

(;B[me]LB[mc:A]C[ISK: This is a thankyou move.  White wants to connect his stones ne ways .. so you forcing him to play a move like that helps you nothing.  Try "A" instead.]
;W[md];B[nf];W[hd];B[hc];W[gc];B[id]C[H: Bad shape, but I feared my group would not easily live, so i tried to make it (somewhat) bigger.

ISK: Too crampped :(.];W[he];B[ie];W[ke];B[jd];W[mc];B[lb];W[oc]
;B[pb];W[qb]
(;B[ig]LB[ma:B][hf:A]C[ISK: A bit of slack white can't cut if u play A.  If you are worried about your group don't.  It's alive. Specially considering you have connect tesuji at B.]
;W[kh];B[mh];W[jf];B[if];W[jh];B[qg];W[qo]
(;B[mp]LB[oo:A]C[H: How could I have made more profit out of my strgon position above this lonely white stone?

ISK: Attack is more strongly. With A, pushing white against your wall above.]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[rf];B[qi]LB[rg:A]C[H: I lost sente here. Coul dI have avoided that without playing tenuki on white A ?]
;W[ql]
(;B[iq];W[cm];B[ek];W[rj]
(;B[qk]TR[mc][nc][oc][ld][md][ke][le][ne][jf][kf][jh][kh]C[ISK: Not important right now. Attacking marked group is more important.]
;W[rk];B[qj];W[ri];B[sh];W[qq];B[pp];W[qp];B[pl];W[qm];B[sg]
C[H: That was useless, but I thought, he would react immediately. It would have been of no great loss, then.
But he ignored it, taking sente.];W[pa];B[oa];W[qa];B[ob];W[jj]
;B[lj];W[hp]
(;B[ii]LB[ge:A][ff:F][li:B][kj:H][ll:E][eo:G][jo:D][ip:C]C[H: In review, I think that thsi move was wrong. As there are white stones above (A) , it does not make territory, not threaten anything. Instead, it made white stronger (thus weakening me around B).
Anything else would be better: Extending around C/D, E, or sealing white in with F.
Even reducing his potential territory around G would have been an option.

ISK: It attacks white's shape but since white can just fix it with "H".  It's nto as painful]
;W[kj];B[hk]C[H: Same here.];W[ih];B[hh];W[ij];B[hi]LB[hj:A]

ISK: All the marked point are endgame moves.  So your goal should be to get as many as you can.  I will now at every one of these moves tell you what you lost or gained.]
;B[bl]C[ISK: 1st Endgame move.]
(;W[bn]LB[bm:A]C[ISK: White mistake. White should play A to get sente.]
;B[bd]C[ISK: 2nd End game move.];W[bc]LB[ac:A]C[ISK: This shouldn't be end black should push at A now.]

(;B[gb]C[ISK:  Problems with move ..

1) Gote
2) Small.];W[fb];B[hb]LB[qr:A]C[ISK: This is gote so not a recommended. A is worth more.]

(;B[oq]LB[or:A]C[ISK: Mistake should be A.];W[or];B[nr]C[H: Stupid move.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[op];B[mq];W[ns];B[mr]C[ISK: This costed you 6 points.]

(;B[kk]LB[li:A]C[ISK: Not a good shape.  and it doesn't get you anything as later white will play "A" adn you end with weak shape.]

;B[kl];W[js];B[kr]C[ISK: Good response but it's not enought to save it unconditional.  White makes a mistak later but becareful next time.]

[pk][el][fl][em][fm][en][fn][eo][kp][lp][kq][lr]C[Final comments:

1) Get better hang of Sente/Gote moves.  Don't just play a end game move because it looks good.  You need to judge sente vs gote move read the book "The Endgame", it's a REALLY good book.

2) Don't attack a oppenents group when you have weak group near him. First fix your weakness then attack your oppenents weakness.

3) Don't play forcing moves that help your opponent.  They are like early xmas gift, I don't wannt give those, I don't think you do either ^_^.

4) Plan one move ahead, that is dont' play crampped moves like ont he top, your group got tooo crampped their.

5) You lost this game because of silly end game istake around P2.  Other then that it's okie.  Just keep at it, you'll get strong.   Good thinking on lots of the areas, Like G8, L2, etc.  ^_^ Keep up to it. 

I hope this helps!  Time spent: 2 hrs.])
