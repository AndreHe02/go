;B[ce];W[pd];B[dp];W[pp];B[dc]C[Here black concentrates his strength in the top left corner...]

(;W[jd]LB[gc:D][pj:C][cm:B][gp:A]C[This seems weak to me.  Too timid, playing far from Black's strong corner, but still seperated from White's own stones, it doesn't do much for White.  Better choices may have been near A or B.  C  completing the sanrensei is also preferable, I think.  If playing on the top side, perhaps D would be preferrable.]

;B[qf];W[pi]LB[qf:A]C[This move doesn't do enough to attack Stone A.  He can still go either direction to try to form a base, and the stone is too far to effectively attack.]

(;B[nc]TR[jd]C[Notice that at this point the Triangle stone looks isolated and weak.  It is not doing much compared to some of the suggested options.]
;W[cm];B[co];W[fq];B[en];W[ip]LB[cm:B][fq:A]C[This move makes "sense" because it gives stone A someplace to run and also starts to build territory on the bottom, but B is isolated, so this doesn't look great for White.]

(;B[dr];W[cj]LB[cj:B][dr:A]C[Luckily Black was timid at A, .... White B is a much needed follow up.  Good job]
;B[qk];W[qi];B[ok]TR[qk]C[The triangle stones don't have a good possibility to build a base, so are running to the center ...]
;W[pl]C[I don't like this move... it leads to ...];B[pk]LB[qf:B]
[qn:A]TR[ok][qk]C[This group is still isolated, but it feels stronger now.  IT can try to connect with A or possibly use B to threated White's 2 stones.]
;W[oq]LB[oq:A]C[This move feels quit small as the White groups are already loosely connected, and move A doesn't threaten Black's life in teh corner either.   I can't quit tell what the purpose of this move was]
;B[nr];W[mr];B[nq];W[np];B[pq]LB[mp:A][op:B]TR[mq][mr]C[Cutting point B is more important to defend than A, keeping black from poking out to split the groups.  The Triangle stones can retreat to the right even Black cuts at A.]

(;W[mp];B[op]LB[mp:1][op:2]C[This works much better for black ... he can attack from teh safety of his living corner.  White doesn't have much choice but to close the hole.]
;W[oo]C[But now Black has sente and can attack some, using his 3 strong stones.]
;B[ol];W[om];B[ql]LB[pm:A]C[The direction of play drifts away at this point, but take a moment to notice how critical point A is.   If Black plays at A he will have more or less guaranteed life on the side, and White's stones would appear very strained.  By playing at A first White can keep the pressure on teh black group that is still not alive.]

;W[ec]TR[jd]C[This is a strange move, playing right up against Blacks power, but too far from the white stone to be effective.]

;B[ci]LB[ci:A]TR[bh][dh][eh]C[Instead Black takes the critical point at A, and White must scramble to protect his marked stones.]
;W[bi];B[bg];W[di];B[cg];W[fi];B[dk]LB[dj:A][cm:B]C[White's weak shape enables this attack on point A, which leads to the attack on B]

;W[ml];B[lj]LB[lj:A][pm:B]C[I'm not sure where Black is running to with A ... as mentioned before B is a key point giving Black an eye if he takes it first.]

(;W[kl]LB[jg:D][lj:A][kl:C][pm:B]C[ Move C doesn't do enough.  Black can't do much by running downward, though he might be able to escape in teh vicinity of D.  Still, the critical point is B.]

;W[mn];B[ml];W[ln]C[Overall, the same advice for most players applies -- think about life and death, try to prevent your opponent from making good eye shape.  The early game plays are very important adn control the direction of the game.

I hope the review was helpful.])
(;W[pm];B[kh]TR[pm]C[By this point Black escapes without playing the key move.  Catching him earlier was important.  The escapte route is up towards his strong areas, so pushing his line upward was a mistake if the intent was to kill the invading group.  

I made some variations, (not neccesarily perfect, just playing around) and I encourage you to try some scenarios on your own in which you take the Triangel spot earlier and see what possibilities arise.]
