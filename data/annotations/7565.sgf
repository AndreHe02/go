C[Hi. In this game I am white, and while I take quite a lot of territory in the early stage, black gets quite thick in the middle. When I invade, my group gets chases quite painfully and black is able to consolidate more territory than me, eventually winning by about 10 points. I think I made some errors in timing and direction and would welcome any comments.]

;B[hq];W[fo];B[ho];W[cq];B[fn];W[go]C[I've seen pro games where white plays at E6 here, but it doesn't seem like white gets a good result. Not one that I can understand, anyway. However, this isn't great either, as it reduces my liberties.]
;B[gn];W[hn];B[io];W[hm];B[eo];W[gq];B[gl];W[jq]C[I decided to destablize black, and take some territory. It may mean sacrificing the H7 stones later.]
;B[iq];W[jp];B[jo];W[lp];B[lo];W[mp];B[hl]C[Black is very strong in the center now, so I have to play carefully.]
;W[ci]C[I think this was too close to black's thickness. C13 was probably better.

klin: White not bad.];B[fc];W[df];B[im];W[qj];B[ql];W[qn]C[This was perhaps a big greedy, and didn't take full board into account. R13 is perhaps the better move.]
;B[qp];W[qo]C[klin: R3 better.];B[pq]
(;W[qq]C[Some other variations are possible. Ending in sente would be nice here, but I couldn't read a variation out that did.]
;B[op];W[rp];B[oo];W[pr];B[qh];W[rl]C[This I felt was my biggest mistake in the game, a completely local move. H17 seems the right timing now.

klin: Indeed S8 not good.  Q9 better.];B[qk];W[rk];B[pj];W[mo]
;B[om];W[rj];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[nr];B[mq];W[lr];B[ok];W[mm]
C[Still H17 is better, I think. Thinking too local.];B[qm];W[rm]

;W[oe]C[Starting a difficult fight.];B[md];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe]
;B[rd];W[qg];B[rh];W[ph];B[pi];W[oh];B[rg];W[rf]C[klin: S14 should reserve.  Move the group toward center.]
;B[pg];W[qf];B[qi];W[og]C[klin: P13 heavy.  Could try N15.  If B M16, B N12, faster.

Before S14 move, R13 is light.  Now the whole group is heavy and under attack.]
;B[nf]C[Nice move!

klin: W is painful.];W[ne];B[me]C[klin: O15, N15 exchange can reserve.]
;W[mh];B[mg];W[li];B[ni];W[nh];B[mk]C[Very cautious from black.]
;W[ji];B[of];W[pf];B[lq];W[kr];B[cc]C[I think black can cap at H11 here, I would be hard pressed to make two eyes. I was in time trouble here, had to play about 6 moves in 20 seconds.

klin: B wins by playing C17.];W[dc];B[db];W[cd];B[bb];W[bc]
;B[cb];W[hi]C[klin: H11 not good.  Should play around G15.  If B secure the upper territory, W center group can connect with the left group, and get some territory on the left.]
;B[kj];W[ki]C[klin: L11 too slow.  Should play around J14.]
;B[dh];W[di];B[ih];W[ii];B[ei];W[eh]C[Last move of byoyomi period, and could start thinking again.]
;B[eg];W[fh];B[dg];W[cf]C[klin: W C14 should fight.  For example, G14, to take a chance.]
;B[gh];W[gi];B[fg];W[fi];B[hh];W[ej]C[klin: E10 too easy.  Should try around K9 to see if you can get a sente. then play at B12.  This is the last opportunity.]
