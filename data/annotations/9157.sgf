C[Hello dear reviewer !



This was an ASR league match on KGS, 30 min + 5x30s byo yomi.



Please review for both side !



We really want the maximum of comments on this game as we both enjoy it and played quite slowly.



Thanks for your work!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po];B[pl];W[mp];B[oo]

janr: the simplest move is A.  There are many more obscure joseki, but this move looks wrong.]

(;W[op];B[np];W[oq];B[pr];W[nq];B[mq];W[mr];B[lq];W[or];B[lr]
;W[qr];B[lo]C[janr: white gets a large corner, and blacks outside has many defects.  This is good for white]

;W[dr];B[er];W[eq]LB[mo:B][cq:A]C[janr: A or tenuki is often a better move.  The game move gives black solid territory while leaving aji in the corner.
White must not be afraid that black will make too much of territory since he has good moves starting with B]
;B[fr];W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[fo];W[ep];B[hp];W[fn];B[nc];W[rd]
LB[re:A]C[janr: the side looks still big, so maybe A is better (by putting more emphasis on the side compared to the game move)]
;B[qd];W[re]C[quite messed up i think. What is the best way to invade black formation ?]
;B[rc];W[qg]LB[qh:A]C[janr: it is better to extend to A (lighter / more space for a base)]
;B[ri]LB[qi:A]C[janr: black's move is very low.  I would prefer A.]

(;W[rh]LB[qi:A]C[janr: white strengthens black; ensuring that the space white has is not sufficient to live.
I would prefer the lighter move at A.];B[qi]C[janr: now white is very cramped.]
;W[og];B[mg];W[oe];B[kc]LB[me:A]C[janr: a move at A seems to more cleanly fence white in.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[me]LB[mf:C][nf:A][pf:B]C[janr: there are several one-point jumps on which a double peep is possible (A and B)
Attachments such as C are good when trying to survive and avoid such double peeps.]
;B[ke];W[oi];B[ph];W[oh];B[pf];W[pg];B[qf];W[rf];B[of];W[ic]
LB[om:B][ho:A][mo:C]C[janr: A looks sente for both sides
Also the lower right contains large moves which may be larger than the game move (B or C?)]
;B[sh]C[janr: This move is small and reduces black's liberies.
ok, maybe black wants to avoid that white makes two eyes, but in that case it is better to search for a move which forces white to spend a move in making two eyes than to actually trying to kill.]
;W[sg];B[si]
(;W[pi]LB[qj:A]C[janr: playing A first is better
The game move immediately gives the opponent a chance to play ko.]
;B[qh];W[qj];B[rg];W[rj]C[if you want to play the ko, you can play a ko threat now already.]
;B[sf];W[se];B[qe]C[janr: this ko is two steps, so the direct ko which was possible a few moves earlier was better]
;W[sg];B[ps];W[qs];B[sf];W[nn]LB[mo:A][lp:B]C[ateri from the wrong side.
playing A gives more ko threats and keeps the option to later cut at B]
;B[mo];W[sg]
(;B[os]LB[ns:A]C[janr: I would prefer the ko threat at A.];W[ns]
;B[sf];W[ok]
(;B[sd]C[janr: black captures the ko early.  It is a two-steps ko, so black can play 3 moves elsewhere if white wants to win it.]
;W[ol]TR[nn][on]C[small ? I played too fast here...
janr: white got decent compensation for the loss of the stones on the upper right side: three black stones were captured, white made a few points of territory, and the two marked stones were saved and effectively used.]
;B[cr]LB[cq:B][ds:A]C[What is the best answer to preserve (if possible) the corner ?

janr: if white really wants to capture this black stone, A is the only option.  Still, there is a lot of aji and often it is better to play B.]

(;W[cs];B[bs];W[ds];B[cq];W[dq];B[ar];W[bq];B[bp];W[cp];B[br]
;W[bo];B[aq];W[ch];B[bg];W[ci]C[hmmm... d11 would have been better I think
janr: d10 or B10 are the normal "joseki" moves, but they work better if there is a stone at c7.]
;B[dj];W[eh]C[janr: black can capture white.  In the game, white makes the situation worse by adding move stones to become cweak or captured.]

;B[ak];W[hk]TR[ej][ek][fk][gk]C[janr: the marked stones are heavy.  They don't cut anything and make no points.  It would have been better to just let black capture two stones, as saving them will cost more than 4 points.]
;B[ho];W[gn];B[hl];W[jk];B[ik];W[ij]C[white in trouble...];B[il]
;W[hi];B[fg];W[gh];B[fh];W[lf];B[kh]LB[nf:A]C[janr: it is better to just connect at A.  White then potentially has two weak groups.]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[nf];B[mh];W[ng];B[jj]C[janr: the result is anyway good for black as now the white stones can be attacked.]
