C[squint [5k\]: hi
usagi5 [5k\]: hi gg

This is a game I played on February 12, 2010. I have tried to put comments in to show what I have been thinking at different points in the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cc]C[I wasn't quite sure what to do with this move.

Black does not want to approach this move too early.];B[fq]
;W[hq]C[White pincers,];B[cq]C[So I jump into the corner.];W[cp]
C[White plays from the opposite side that I wanted him to, but it makes sense.

Bad choice for white.];B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[dl]C[Here I was anticipating G5, so I could after play C9 or D9.]
(;B[dd];W[dc];B[ed];W[ce]C[I am used to seeing B15. How should I respond to this?]
;B[cd]C[I try to push through.];W[bd];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb]C[I try to utilize the cut at B17 somehow.]

I think L4 would be better as attack.];W[qn]C[How should I respond to a double pincer like this?]

(;B[oh]C[This is a wrong move. You should read in advance, if such a move works. If not, do not play it.]
;W[og];B[pg];W[nh];B[mi];W[oi];B[ph];W[ni];B[pi];W[pj]C[What should I do in a fight like this?]
;B[qj];W[qk];B[oj]C[In retrospect, I don't think this cut worked.]

(;B[km];W[fj];B[ei]C[I probably should have played at F11.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[gk];B[fl];W[gj];B[eh]C[It's an exchange. Maybe I took the wrong side?]
;W[gn];B[fn];W[fo]C[usagi5 [5k\]: thanks for the game!
squint [5k\]: thanks
usagi5 [5k\]: I messed up at L11
usagi5 [5k\]: I could have gone at M11, i think
squint [5k\]: maybe

Here I resign the game. I've lost quite a bit of my old center territory (though not all of it), and white has a lot.

Thanks!

I think white is better, but black still can play an interesting game, white is may 10-15 points ahead.]
