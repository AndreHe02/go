C[Hello, my reviewer!

I'm black in this game.

I think I had made a lot of mistakes and maybe some horrible ones had appeared from the beginning. I was slaughtered by my opponent in this game. Unfortunately, I don't know much about the mistakes I made. Thank you for pointing them out and I think I would learn very much from this.

I agree, k3 is where I would play.];W[fq];B[io]C[You are wide open here, altho I'm sure you realized this by now.]
;W[cj]
(;B[pj]C[Look at the board here, who is ahead?

White clearly is marking off more territory.

This might not be bad if black was marking off slightly less territory, but more securely. This is not the case, the bottom is wide open. with at least two invasion points on the right.]

;W[pp];B[qp]C[Maybe my mistakes appeared some where around here but I couldn't know where went wrong.

Was my attack on white too aggressive?

It just seems like I was making lots of cutting points.];W[po]

The upper w stones are fine as they stand, even after this move.]
