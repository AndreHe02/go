C[Dear Reviewer,
My name is Avi; I played Black in this game and lost. I need your help to identify my mistakes and give me advice to improve my game.
Thanks!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec];B[cd];W[cg];B[ed];W[fd];B[ee]
;W[dc];B[cf]C[Avi: This is not exactly like the joseki (C17) but eventually the standard pattern was achieved.
prana: C14 is possible too. Normally, w answers this move with w D13. Then b C17]

(;W[nc]C[Avi: Here White deviated also from the joseki - could I have punished him for tenuki?
prana: w tenuki is strange. b Q16 is not weak, so you don't have to defend. 
What about b D13? Makes you thick on the left side. 
Thus, you can better fight on the upper side later...]
(;B[qf];W[jc]
(;B[cc]C[prana: c17 is a big move.
But since there is already a w stone on K17, I personally would prefer b d13]
;W[bf];B[be];W[df]
(;B[ce];W[dh];B[bg]C[Avi: I thought I should stablized by group even in gote - was I right?
prana: No, I think this is wrong.
You are already alive in the corner. Thus, catching 1 stone is rather pointless (you are overconcentrated). 
w is happy, because he is getting stronger outside (sabaki).]
;W[bh];B[af];W[cm];B[eg]C[Avi: Is this sequence too early?
prana: as long as w answers, its okay.];W[dg];B[ci]
(;W[ch]C[prana: w heavy];B[ck]
(;W[di]C[w too slow];B[dj];W[bi]
(;B[cj]C[prana: This looks a bit heavy. I recommend to play more lightly.]
;W[em];B[fj];W[fi];B[gj];W[gi];B[hj];W[hi]
(;B[gm]C[Avi: Please comment about this - I may have pressed the top before G7?
prana: G7 is solid. I like it. First, strengthen yourself, then attack.]
;W[fe];B[ef];W[gg]C[Avi: Now White feel comfortable at the top and I feel a bit behind.
prana:Maybe you are a few points behind. But I dont think it really matters. 
a) You can continue normally with J11 e.g.
b) Also a testing move b K15 looks interesting. How will w answer? Will he defend or attack?]

(;B[lc]C[Avi: So I decided to play a bit more aggressive.
prana: Instead of invading, consider reducing.
B can build a moyo too. B m17 is very deep in whites moyo. 
What happens after w O17?
If b gets captured, then its a BIG loss!
Often invasions gain a little, but risk a lot.]

(;B[ji];W[ij];B[ik];W[jk];B[il];W[kk];B[mj]C[Avi: White's cut has given Black a target for attack, but I could not get too much out of it
prana: Yes, I agree, w cut is probably overplay. 
But as you before, w feels now behind and tries something...]
;W[jm];B[nj];W[oi]
(;B[lm]C[prana: I think, this is wrong direction, because G10 group is not that strong.
Better cut.];W[km];B[ln];W[im];B[hm];W[jp]
(;B[fo]C[Avi: I had to take car of my G10 group
prana: OK, but G5 looks a bit strange.];W[gp];B[fp];W[gq];B[do]
;W[co];B[dn];W[cn];B[dm];W[dl];B[fn];W[cl];B[dq];W[cq];B[ep]
;W[cp];B[fq];W[lq]C[prana: bad result for b. w makes profit and b is not really alive]
;B[mp]
(;W[mq];B[lp]C[Avi: Is O3 immediately better?
prana: yes, much better. The exchange is strengthening w and doesnt help b.]

(;B[fr]C[prana: You were lucky to play here first!
But locally, better play shape move at e2.];W[dr];B[hr]C[prana: Jumping is just endgame. It doesnt make eyes...]
;W[iq];B[jr];W[ir];B[is];W[gr];B[gs]C[prana: b is still dead.]

(;B[fl]C[prana: aji keshi. Now, you lost the possibility of cutting at F8]
;W[el];B[ek]LB[cb:A][kb:E][rh:D][bk:B][ek:F][rr:C]C[prana: too small. Only 2p. 
Try to estimate (or count) the values of the marked points:
A 
B
C
D
E]
(;W[cb]C[Avi: I think at this point that White has a significant lead. The rest is mostly yose. I appreciate your comments on the yose too.

Thanks a lot for you help!
Avi

prana: You are welcome! It was an interesting game and a pleasure to replay it.]
