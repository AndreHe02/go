C[Hi, 

Being a 4 kyu on KGS, I'm not perfect by any means, but I have a few pointers for you. 

-Tim (Igoaggie on KGS)];B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[eq]
C[Opening looks good so far.];B[ce]TR[dc]SQ[cg][dg][ch][dh]
[ci][di]C[When someone approaches your 3-4 in this situation (this principle applies to the 4-4 as well) you should think about using a pincer. I've marked some of the common pincers for this approach move. You might want to think about a distance pincer such as d11 because it would put pressure on black's attacking stone while also working towards an extension from your shimari (corner enclosure) in the bottom left. I've marked an alternative variation.]

(;W[de];B[cd];W[dd];B[cc]TR[cf]C[In this situation, you should probably continue responding locally. I would recommend a hane so that you start to close black in while making a big wall. The variation is shown.]

(;W[lq];B[df]C[This is a big problem for white. Black is going to make lots of territory on the left, and white's wall is going to be less useful.]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[po];B[nq]LB[pl:3][pm:2][pn:1]TR[po][qo]C[There is a rule to help you remember how far to extend from a wall. Count the number of stones that you are jumping from, then go that many of spaces plus 1, and you will be at the right spot. So you are jumping from two stones, so you should count three spaces and play. Variation included.]

(;W[ql]C[This is a bit cramped.]
(;B[di]TR[ef]C[A move at the marked point has been important for a long time. If white gets it, the wall may still be worthwhile. If black gets it, then she will be able to build potential in the center while destroying white's potential. Take a look at the variations.]

(;W[cl];B[jq];W[iq];B[kp]LB[mp:B][jr:A]C[You can use A to connect to j3 which saves m3 or you can play B to run away and escape.]

(;W[kq]C[This move doesn't seem to work. You might have other options. Go back for the variations.]
;B[jr]
(;W[jp]C[This is digging a deep hole, I'm afraid. Best to cut your losses and play m4]
;B[ip];W[jo];B[hq];W[gq]C[This move doesn't help you much in the situation. I'd probably play the net at m5 instead.]
;B[lp]C[Black pounces on the chance to stop you from playing the net. But you can still try to sneak out with n4. Variation shown.]

(;W[hc]C[There are a few things to say about this move. 

1. It's too close to your wall to be effective. Remember the rule about counting the spaces on the wall. 
2. E14 is a must if your wall is ever to be worth it's weight.]
;B[qg]C[This move is also a bit close for black. She could extend further.]
;W[qi];B[lc]
(;W[io]C[Instead of this move, you might want to think about the double atari. It looks like black has to capture, so you might have a chance of sealing him in so that you could make a moyo (framework) in the center. Variation shown.]
;B[hp];W[ho];B[gp];W[fq]C[Now black has pushed through and you can't make territory there anymore.]
;B[og];W[ci];B[ch];W[cj];B[bh];W[cb]C[This hane is indeed good, but there are bigger moves to be played. I still think that e14 need to be played.]
;B[bb];W[fe];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[ea]C[This is really small.]
;B[ef];W[da]C[This is even smaller. Black should not respond to this. 

Also, black has set up some crushing moves which are used to take your stones.]
;B[cb];W[hr];B[ir];W[gs];B[ee]C[Ouch. Here it is.]
(;W[ed];B[fd];W[fc];B[ec];W[gb];B[gd];W[hd];B[gc];W[fb];B[ib]
C[By now, that group's dead. At least that's what I thought. Was there any way to save it? Or whatever?

Sure enough. If you connect at h18, you could try to run to the center. You can't make two eyes at the top, but nothing can stop you from running.]

(;W[ge];B[ed];W[is];B[hb];W[js];B[ks];W[hs];B[lr];W[go];B[kr]
;W[fp];B[mq]C[Black should've connected at j3 to avoid the capture.]
;W[iq];B[he]C[This move is pretty devastating. Black is getting a lot at the top. Black is in control at this point.]
;W[oi];B[ie];W[mh];B[mg];W[lg];B[mf];W[nh];B[lf];W[kh]C[The extension to l13 is better because it doesn't give black the forcing moves.]
;B[kg];W[lh];B[jg]LB[dj:A][mn:B]TR[cj][cl][go][ho][io][jo]C[At this point, you really want to consider your options. You have a shot at a really big center, but you need to block at A to make the most of it. Black has a very strong group around B and can play many moves to reduce you on this side. It would probably be best to play at A to make a big chunk of territory over there.]
;W[no];B[ln]C[Black proves that there is room to jump in.];W[lo]
C[This only helps black become stronger];B[ko];W[mo];B[km];W[kj]
C[Keep in mind what you want to do. The right center is ruined, but the left center still has a chance.]
;B[jh];W[ji];B[ii];W[ij];B[hi];W[hj];B[gj];W[gk];B[fj];W[ej]
C[This is a big mistake. You really need to seal black off with g9. This allows black to slip right in.]
;B[ei];W[dj];B[fk]C[And that is exactly what happens.];W[fi]
;B[fh];W[fm];B[gl];W[hl];B[hk];W[ik];B[gk];W[gm];B[el];W[em]
;B[dl];W[dm];B[ck];W[bk];B[dk];W[ek]C[This is a clever connect-and-die move. Good eye!]

;B[ll];W[lk];B[ok];W[pj];B[nj];W[mj];B[rh]C[Black's lead is pretty much secured at this point. There is little white can do to make a comeback.]

C[I'm really not sure about your rank. It's very hard to gauge someone's rank without playing them. If I had to make a guess, I would say that you are somewhere between 15 and 20 kyu. Your opponent seems just a bit stronger than you, but it's very hard to tell from a game where there were mistakes that were taken advantage of. Overall, it's a good game and you did a lot of things very well. I hope the review has been helpful.

Thanks,
Igoaggie])

C[you punish.];B[jp];W[lr];B[ir];W[ks]C[Black cannot put you in the ladder at j3 because of the ladder breaker at c8. So you can probably connect.  And if black plays something sneaky to get away, you can still run with n4. (But B is probably dead at j2)]
