C[Hello.
I ended up winning this game, but only by a small margin. There are some mistakes along the way that I can see myself, but there's bound to be others, so those are the ones that I'm looking for help spotting :)

I played as white.

Kamber];B[pq];W[pd];B[dp];W[cd];B[qo];W[jq]C[Played this one to prevent him from building too much of a moyo on the lower side. The intention was to restrict him from making the ideal extention from the shimari.

T:this is fine so far];B[lq]
(;W[gq];B[dn]
(;W[ci]C[I'm not too sure about this one. I considered making an enclosure in the upper left, but that would let him take the right side in front of the shimari while extending from the lower left.

T:this doesnt seem to do much for you, see the variations];B[ed]
;W[ee]
(;B[dd]C[T:to be honest i dont know the best way to respond to this move, it is not joseki.]

(;W[de];B[cc];W[bd];B[bc];W[fd];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb]SQ[ce][fe]
C[I'm fairly satisfied with this result, but I'm not sure blacks play was optimal.

T:there are weak points for white here, i really think an extra move is needed]

(;W[pj]C[Played both as an extension and as a ladderbreaker before I blocked at G 18]

(;B[dr]SQ[gq][jq]C[T:the marked group needs some help now i think, however black doesnt attack immediately, a mistake on his part]
;W[gb];B[ec]CR[hc][ge]C[Of cause, I failed to realize that the ladder no longer worked after this play. Should have played W26 at H17 or G15.]

(;W[ko];B[kp];W[jp];B[lo];W[kn]C[Perhaps W 26 was too greedy. It left me overconcentrated.


T:it was not greedy, you had to play a move for your group to survive]
;B[nc]
(;W[lc]LB[gc:B][jc:A]C[T:it apperas that with this move you were thinking of territory around the A area, but this is not a good plan since white can destroy it with the cut at B]

(;B[ld]C[Didn't like the result I would get if I let him push me down, so I decided to take the fight.]

[os]C[I think the result was all right. I made some mistakes, but overall I think I played pretty well for my rank. So what I'm looking for is the major mistakes that I didn't spot.

T: mainly a few joseki errors on both sides and a couple of points in the opening are the most important things for you to look at for now]
