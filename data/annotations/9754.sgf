C[Dear reviewer,

I have given my ideas behind my moves, and also some of my opponent's moves. I think it was a close game, but my opponent got bigger patches of territory than me. Therefore I would like to know if there were things that I could have done better, and what things I have missed in my thinking process.

Thanks in advance!

J: my name is Jay, my comments will start with "J:"];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[dd];W[qp];B[qj]C[J: R10 is not the largest move in the board right now.  Black should consider the width and height of the corner stones.  In the case, the bottom side is higher and wider.  A simple approach like P4 is bigger.]
;W[cf];B[gc];W[ci]C[Perhaps the 3-3 invasion would've been better, as black can get a big territory now, if he plays C16.

J: White's C11 is ok when trying to keep his stones on the left side.  White can also play D10 to be faster.  

J: The invasion seems a bit early. Black playing at A is large but gote.]
;B[oq];W[qm]C[J: White's bottom side has more growth potential than black's right side, so white can also think about pincering here.]
;B[qg]C[J: R13 secures the right side at the detriment of the bottom black stone. Black should consider an extension on the bottom side as as far as K3.]
;W[kq]
(;B[oo]C[J: P5 is a single purpose move to run away. In this shape black can make a base first.  See variation.]
;W[qq]C[To prevent an attack with a black move like R2 or R3.]
;B[mq];W[hp]C[I thought about H3 as well. I think that would have been a safer move.

J: H4 is ok.]
(;B[fp]C[J: F4 is a strange move. I think black's only intention was to break up white's bttom disregarding the left side and corner.

J: black should instead invade the 3-3.  See variations.];W[dn]
C[Here, I thought about G3 to prevent black from attaching at H3, but I thought G3 would be too much a contact play with a weak stone.

J: D6 is a good attacking move.];B[fn];W[go]C[To make black heavy, and to make the jump to H7 possible, which further attacks the black stones and makes some shape for the white group.]
;B[fo];W[hm];B[fl];W[dl];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr]C[Prevents a black base.]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[gq];W[ip]C[To prevent the cut.

J: Result is good for white.];B[mc]TR[pd][qg]C[J: This shape is not very efficient as white can still dive into R17 and probably live.  If black wants the corner, he should just play P17. See variation.]

(;W[bd]C[J: Invading the corner is possible too. And maybe a smidge larger.]
;B[cc];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc]
(;W[rd]C[I found out that this is not the right order of moves, and not the common joseki.

J: right, see previous variation.];B[re];W[rb]C[I probably confused it with the joseki of the 3-3 invasion when black made a knight's move enclosure, instead of a large knight's move enclosure, and where white makes a ko.]
;B[sd];W[ob];B[nb];W[od]C[J: it's still not too late to play Q19.]
;B[nc];W[sc];B[rc];W[gm]C[This was the only ko threat I could find.]
;B[fm];W[rd];B[cm]C[I think C5 would have been an even bigger ko threat for black.]
;W[se]C[I ignored black's ko threat, because I couldn't find any other ko threats for me.]
;B[dm]C[J: Very painful for white. Might be larger than the top left corner.]
;W[co]C[To keep my corner alive.];B[rf];W[oe]C[I extended here, because I thought the aji of these two stones could be used later.]
;B[pf];W[ck]C[Sente, because black needs to connect at E6, E7 or E8.]
;B[en]C[J: black can also connect with c8. For more points in endgame.]
;W[nr];B[or];W[mr];B[nq];W[lq];B[lp];W[lo]C[L4 seemed too slack to me, as it gives black good shape when black plays M5, so I played here to keep black a bit more overconcentrated.]
;B[mo];W[ko]C[L4 for white seemed not very good shape to me, because black can atari at M6.]
;B[qr]C[N7 or O7 seemed better for black, instead of making an endgame move.

J: yes, A would be normal,];W[rr];B[qs];W[rs];B[os]
(;W[jc]TR[od][oe]C[I wanted to prevent black from making points here. Perhaps L17 would've been a better invasion, though, as it makes the extension to J17 possible, which makes a small base, and it would make more use of the aji of the marked two stones.

J: k17 is a bit dangerous as it's deep inside black, sphere of influence.  K16 is a little safer.

J: Another idea is to shoulder hit at H16 to keep black low.  See variation.]
;B[bc]C[Also a big move.];W[ce]C[I'm not sure if I should have answered it, though, perhaps I should have played K15 or M16.

J: yes, B is more active.];B[le];W[hd]C[Threatening to press with G16, or to make some shape.]
;B[hc];W[id];B[gd];W[hg]C[J: J13 is safer, black has a nice peep at J14 later.]
;B[mg]TR[jc][hd][id]C[This looks very big, but I didn't want to let my marked stones get under attack.]
;W[ll]C[To make a box-like shape to get some more points.

J: only about 5 points in endgame. White can try something like O6 to see if anything shakes loose.]
;B[nj]C[This also looks very big, though, perhaps I should have played a capping move at P10, or a shoulder hit like O12.

J: about 6 points endgame.];W[fj]C[I also wanted to make frameworks, in order to compete with black's points. With this move I wanted to make miai of F14 and a move like M10.

J: it's difficult to make points in the center.  If I was counting this game, I would give zero points for both sides in the center.]
;B[bl];W[bk]C[To prevent a black monkey-jump.];B[bn];W[bo];B[cn]
C[I ignored this one, because it was only like 2 points.

J: black is ensuring his life.];W[ff];B[ge];W[hf];B[jf];W[jg]
C[I think this is my biggest mistake in this game. I had a very simple misread. I should just have played J14.]
;B[he]
(;W[if]C[J: White must still play J15. See variation.];B[ie]
;W[kf];B[je];W[hk]C[To prevent black from seeping in, and make another framework, but M10 would probably have been a better move. I don't think a black move at G9 would have been a problem, white can just play at H9/J9.

J: it's about the same. Still not too late to try O6.];B[lj]
;W[ac];B[cd];W[ad];B[ef];W[eg];B[df];W[dg];B[fe];W[fg];B[jj]
C[Would have been a nice point for white.];W[ab]C[J: why not B18?]
;B[bb];W[rk];B[rj];W[qk]C[J: just fall back to s8.  t10 is sente later because of P15 aji.]
;B[sk];W[sl];B[sj];W[rm];B[pk];W[pl];B[pq];W[ki];B[kj];W[lh]
;B[mh];W[mk];B[mj];W[ok];B[pj];W[jl]
(;B[mn]C[I don't really see what this move does, it looks a bit slow to me.

J: black worries about his life, as he should.  See variations.]

(;W[lf];B[mf];W[fs]C[J: monkey jump is a reduction move. In this case, D2 is bigger because it also expands white's corner.

J: this is my last comment. It seems like the game was close until white's K13 blunder. I think this is one of those games where white lost by himself.  The take-away from this game is that white needs to be a bit more accurate when reading to prevent the top right corner. Thanks for showing me this game.]
