C[CJT - reviewing the game with comments marked CJT.


Overall this was a tight game, with many areas of close fighting.

Main points I noticed about your play:

- You played opening moves in the center of the board too soon - they could have become targets, or separated from your strong bases.  As it is they fared ok, but you would have found it easier sticking to the conventional "corners, then sides, then center" principles.

- You did well to spot your opponent's weak groups, but failed to take advantage fully.  Moves 25-100 were one large fight for the life of an enemy group, that should have won you the game there and then.

- Generally both players attacked with contact plays too much - there are some variatinos that I hope illustrate that a one-space jump or knights move (to give but two examples) can be much more powerful for pressurizing weak groups or invading stones.

Hope you enjoy my review - please feel free to post any questions back to me.]
;B[pp];W[cd];B[qd];W[cp];B[hp]LB[ep:a][ed:b][oc:c][eq:d]C[CJT - more usual would be moves around A, B or C

From the 3-4 opening, the urgent moves are making or preventing shimari (corner enclosures)

Note I prefer A to D because white is low (3-rd line on both corners) on the left, and after D white will find it easier to get more central influence.]
;W[dj];B[pi]LB[pc:a]C[CJT - Again the shimari is probably more important at this point.

Note if 3 was at A this would be a very famous fuseki <http://senseis.xmp.net/?HighChineseOpening>]
;W[jd];B[fl]LB[ep:a][oc:b]C[CJT - this move is very strange - it is usual to avoid playing too centrally early in the opening - the stone has no base and is not making any territory. There are still key moves around A and B]
;W[dl];B[lp];W[od]C[I don't really know what to do next.  However I almost always lose the corners in the early midgame due to the opponent's magic, so I decide to re-inforce it.]

(;B[pb]C[I did not really know what to do on this move.  However I almost always lose the corners in the early midgame so I decided to try to reinforce it.]
;W[gp]
(;B[hq]C[I usually have difficulty responding to opponent's attacks in the opening.  They usually end up winding up with me losing the entire edge of the board, so I try to reinforce the edge.]
;W[gq];B[gn];W[go];B[lf]C[CJT - Another move that is just thrown on its own into the center with no support.

You should not leave the G5 stone unanswered - you are in real trouble if W plays H5 now...]

(;W[ld];B[fg]C[I wanted to establish control over the center of the board, while putting myself in a position to attack the edges if possible.

CJT - attacking edges from the center is not an easy thing to do. The stones at the edge find it much easier to make eyes.  In the opening you should be looking to establish yourself on the edges, before moving into the center.]
;W[fd];B[dg];W[pj]
(;B[oi]C[This is another opening game attack that I don't know well how to deal with.  This was sort of a random choice among 10 or 15 moves, it seems a little unnatural now that I look back but I don't know what is better.]
;W[po]
(;B[om]C[Trying to find a way to prevent the two white stones from connecting.]
;W[pm];B[ok];W[pk]LB[fj:a]C[As usual, I have lost the edge.  This is a common occurence in my games.  But it looks like I've established a firm grip on the center.

CJT - You should take a quick look at some games from higher-level players of pros - you will see that almost every game, the center is worth just a handful of points - the real territory is made on the sides and in the corners.

There are many ways in which W can reduce your center territory - from secure bases on the upper and left sides.  If W attacks the centre at A you have to worry about the group above living, which will give W enough initiative to eat up the centre territory.]
;B[ro]C[If I'm lucky I might be able to prevent white from getting 2 eyes here.  Worst case scenario I can at least reduce the territory he's going to gain on the edge.]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[rn];B[rk]C[This may have been a bad move.  I was surprised by white's next move because I carelessly overlooked it.  But this move led to an interesting battle later on, so perhaps it wasn't so bad after all (even though I lost the battle, perhaps someone stronger than me could have won it).]
;W[rp];B[ql];W[pl];B[rq];W[sp];B[rm];W[qm];B[pn]LB[no:a][qj:b]
C[Trying to make sure he cannot get an eye, even if it means sacrificing a piece.

CJT - this leads to a fight where black can lose quite a lot of territory - white has some dnagerous responses to this.  I prefer blocking white in with A or B.]

(;W[on];B[oo];W[qn];B[nn]C[Eye is prevented.];W[pn]TR[qq][op]
[no][nm][ol][oj][qk][qi]C[CJT - you look to have done well here to surround the W group - but your perimeter has at least 8 plays which either cut, threaten to cut or escape.

Without looking in any great detail, it seems highly likely that a combination of some of these moves will allow W to escape.

When fighting to kill a group, it is often better to avoid contact plays - you can prevent eyes while still maintaining strngth in your defence.

In cases like this, if W does escape, you will wish you had left fewer weaknesses behind :o)]
;B[qj]C[At this point it seems like the white stones are dead.  But for some reason I don't know how to deal with the opponent "running", which you will see in the next few moves.]
;W[so];B[oj];W[ol];B[nm];W[nl];B[ml];W[nk];B[hg]C[This is intended to be a ladder breaker, but unfortunately it gives white the chance to escape and it quickly turns into a chase that I don't know how to win.

CJT - yes this move doesn't threaten anything. When playing tenuki think hard about what you want to achieve - you should be playing a double move that makes white decide which area to concentrate on.

Also there's no ladder for black - see variation.]
(;W[mk];B[ll];W[mi];B[mh];W[ni];B[nh];W[li];B[ki];W[lk]C[He has eye potential here, so I'm already keeping in mind that an eventual O10 or M10 might be necessary.]
;B[kk]C[CJT - I admit at this point you're looking strong - you have given white no territory for his invasion, but are amassing a large lower side - if you have the chance to play one or two more defensive moves there that is!]
;W[no];B[np]C[I ignored his thread, because with this I could respond to P4 with P3 and he would be forced to close the hole.  I wanted to try to keep momentum for the race which I'm always terrible at winning.]
;W[mo];B[ln]TR[ll][ml][nm][nn]C[CJT - This is a good move - anywhere else would have left the marked stones in real danger.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[oo];B[mp];W[sq];B[rr];W[sr];B[qr]C[I played this because I felt like S1 would have led to my capture in the corner, although I was unable to read far enough to actually prove it to myself, it was a hunch.  This shape seems to have good eye potential anyway, and I'm always bad at making eyes.]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[pr];B[or];W[lo];B[ko];W[kj];B[jj];W[lj];B[nj]
C[Preventing the eye, he still only has 1 eye at S5 (after he plays T6)]
;W[kh]
(;B[jh];W[ji];B[ii];W[ki];B[ik]C[I would have liked to have played L13, but the double atari would have completely killed my attack.]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[kg];B[jf]C[still can't figure out how to win the race

CJT - rather than trying to win a 'race' you need to think how to use you attacking moves to win.  You don't capture the white group (although it's possible that somehow you could) but you have had a 75 move passage where you are attacking the _whole_ time - you should be gaining more from this...]
;W[kf];B[ke];W[je]C[I probably have lost it at this point, best I can do is strengthen my position on the right and try to pick up the pieces.

CJT - right idea, but too late to maximise your gains in this game]
;B[if];W[le];B[kc]C[He must answer this with L16, allowing me to build some territory on the top and hopefully connect the left and right sides.]
;W[kd];B[mb];W[jc];B[ka]C[still trying to find a way to connect to the left, but I'm not holding out much hope anymore.

CJT - the play on the 1st line is unusual, and doesn't gain you much here. I like M17 or 18 better.]
