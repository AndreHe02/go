;B[pc]C[I'm playing as black in this game. Thanks for commenting.

[gromit\]
You're welcome.];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[qe];W[jj];B[ec]C[I was going for the double shimari jsut to try it, i think it worked nicley.

[gromit\]
Well, why not, if white lets you play it...];W[qg]C[[gromit\]
I'm not sure to understand White's strategy here: Black is solid, and White has, up to now, played for influence (center oriented) but suddenly plays low...]
;B[ci]TR[dj]C[[gromit\]
Your extension is a bit tight, the marked spot is more common, and it would also steal White's extension.]
;W[dj]C[[gromit\]
Consistent with White's strategy, and exploiting Black's previous move.]
;B[qn]C[[gromit\]
Approaching corners is important, but if you lose the initiative there, White will continue around his previous move (C10 for instance) and build a large scale framework.]
;W[qo]TR[qj]C[[gromit\]
Not good! White reinforces Black and leaves the corner open. This would only be possible with a White stone around R10, now if Black extends there (after Q6) he will reach a perfect formation and at the same time pincer White's R13 stone.]

(;B[qk]C[[gromit\]
Q6 first, see variation.];W[om]TR[pn]C[[gromit\]
???
Q6 is better: White builds a wall (consistent with it's framework), reduces Black's space.
if now Black Q6, White is split in two!];B[jq]C[[gromit\]
You should not leave your two edge stones alone: they are weak and surrounded!
K3 is a big play but Q6 is urgent.];W[gq];B[mq];W[gc]C[[gromit\]
White should play Q6 or such to attack Black AND defend his corner.
If White wants to play on the upper edge K17 is safer.];B[ic]
C[[gromit\]
Yes!
Black's upper left is strong, use it to attack.];W[kc]
(;B[he]C[Would J 15 have been better, i was trying to connect with the left corner.

[gromit\]
Well, you shouldn't be worried about connecting because you're the one who's attacking (Black has more stones than White there).
J15 has a better shape (no weakness at H16 or J16; H16 could have been considered too) and builds a larger framework for Black in the upper left. With J15 White can connect his two stones but he suffers (see variation).]
;W[id]C[[gromit\]
White strikes on Black's weakness, but a bit early (L15 or such first is necessary)]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[jd]C[[gromit\]
Yes!];W[jc];B[mc]C[I completley missed the atari on J17, and I this cost me later on.

[gromit\]
:(];W[ib];B[ie]C[[gromit\]
Yes, at least Black is connected ans White is still not completely alive]
;W[kd]C[K15 here would have been better too I think. I thought I could break up that group but was wrong.]

(;B[ic]C[[gromit\]
K15 is better, as White shows you by his next move...];W[je]
;B[id];W[jf]C[[gromit\]
Black is heavy, White is almost alive and out in the center :(
There are still big points in the lower part of the board though...]
;B[ke]TR[je][jf]C[[gromit\]
This cut works, but what is it useful to?
White will get out anyway, and you'll reinforce the marked stones too...]
;W[le];B[kf];W[kg]C[[gromit\]
White hasn't read the shicho properly... K13 is better (threatens the cutting stones and the big block around J16).]
;B[lf];W[mf];B[lg];W[md];B[jg]
(;W[kh]C[[gromit\]
The two stones are better (see var) as they split Black in two!!!]
;B[if]C[J13 would be better no? (I see all my mistakes now and better moves :)

[gromit\]
No what you did was fine: now your two groups are solidly connected, WHite has no threats against them.]
;W[mh];B[gd];W[fc];B[fd];W[eb];B[db]C[[gromit\]
yes!];W[fb];B[qi]C[I should have protected at D 17 instead of tenuke.

[gromit\]
yes...];W[dc];B[cc];W[ed];B[dd];W[ec];B[ee];W[cb]C[[gromit\]
This cut is small at this point in the game...];B[bb];W[da]
;B[df]C[This stone wasnt' needed here. I feared a cut at D15, but i could have captured any stones moving in at D15.

[gromit\]
True. If you want to build something here C10 or D11 would have been better.]
;W[fg]C[[gromit\]
A bit too far.
I still don't understand why White doesn't want to use his stones to build territory (C10 for instance)]
;B[oq]C[[gromit\]
We're back here... Then Q6 separating the corner is still better]
;W[pq];B[cj]C[Was there a better move then C 10, I wanted to make some territory in the bottom left side but i feared being cut by a white stone at C10 if i had gone lower. Maybe C9?

[gromit\]
C10 is very good: it gives Black territory, and weakens White framework.
Other points in that area would have been C6 or even C3... but C10 is better (the other ones are still there!)]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[ck];B[og]C[[gromit\]
Why not continue at B9?
The isolated White stone is not easy to capture and not so big either...]
;W[oh];B[pg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pf];B[qf]C[Maybe P 14, then i would have a bigger group there and have mroe influence.

[gromit\]
No, R14 is better: you split White and reconnects your stones!!!]
;W[of];B[rg];W[ng];B[qg]C[[gromit\]
Not necessary (small) if White captures, you recapture and have lost only one point...]
;W[pd];B[qd];W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[nb];W[nd];B[lc]C[This move seems bad, any suggestions?

[gromit\]
The only question is: will White answer? if White answers at M16 (which is not necessary) then this move is not so bad. Otherwise, you lost initiative to save one stone, which is quite small compared to the lower side of the board...]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[kb]C[[gromit\]
perfect, now WHite lost himself the initiative...];B[ld];W[me]
;B[dk]C[Any better moves then this? This group was cut off from the top and i was lucky to make 2 eyes.

[gromit\]
B9 is enough.

However, you just cut off one White group (top left) don't you want to try and attack it?]
;W[dl];B[ek];W[ej]
(;B[bk]C[[gromit\]
Just continue pushing, then you can cut at C8! (see var).];W[cl]
;B[fk]C[[gromit\]
Then B9 was bad... If you play B9 continue at B8!];W[fj]
(;B[el]C[[gromit\]
Bad shape, you remove your own liberties];W[em];B[dm]C[What would ahve been a better move here?

[gromit\]
Not easy, the previous move is the problem, not this one... may be G9]

[gromit\]
Yes, it seems more solid and simpler.];W[gp];B[fo];W[go];B[gn]

White should play elsewhere (S6 or Q2, or may be reinforce around M12).]
;B[in]C[[gromit\]
To do what?];W[jn];B[io];W[ip];B[jo]
(;W[iq]C[Would L6 have been better? If i had gone L6, white could have moved to K4 which would be a threat.

[gromit\]
White should have played K4 now!! (so you're playing K4 is good)]
;B[jp];W[ko];B[jm]C[Perhaps L6 would have been better?

[gromit\]
I'm not sure what either of you is trying to do...
If all this is about White's center territory, it is open on the right so O10 is not bad (attacks the upper group too!).]
;W[kn];B[kp]C[[gromit\]
useless, you're strong on the lower side (J2 sente).
Better pushing out with L7.];W[km];B[lo];W[mo];B[ln];W[lm];B[mn]
;W[nn];B[no]C[[gromit\]
Why not continue pushing (N7)?];W[mm];B[mp];W[oo]C[[gromit\]
Around P10 becomes very big];B[op];W[pj]C[[gromit\]
White is right!
But there's a weakness left at Q6];B[pm]C[Any better moves?]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[pn]C[[gromit\]
Now, no weakness left, WHite is happy!];B[qm]C[Perhaps i should have sacraficed the bottom of this territory and moved at Q9 instead to invade the middle. Igot lucky however when white moved at R10]
;W[qj]C[Igot lucky white moved here. this could have been a large territory.

[gromit\]
Yes, Q9 is much better.];B[rj];W[rn];B[rm];W[ro];B[nl]C[[gromit\]

Better play elsewhere!];W[ig];B[hg];W[ih];B[ir];W[hq];B[hr]

;B[bl];W[bm];B[am]C[[gromit\]
Too greedy!];W[an];B[bj]C[I almost moved to B8 which would have been bad.]
;W[al];B[ak];W[am];B[hs]C[[gromit\]
very small (and dangerous, see var).]

;W[sn];B[qs];W[rs];B[ps];W[rr];B[im];W[jf];B[je];W[jg]C[[gromit\]
What is the result??
There are still undefined points (Q15???) Black has to reinforce some points (after P11, S9 becomes dangerous) The C13 stones are not clear. If Black H12 White will have to G11 at some point.

To sum up, White never really tried to use his framework to build territory (the aim of the game!) and Black did build around his shimari, but played very dangerously, which allowed White to come back into the game.

Both of you show some good moves but should work on "strategy", that is, decide what you want to do, be consistent with it, and avoid answering blindly what your opponent does.

There is also some work on life and death and tesuji (cf. upper left group, whose status is undecided), there are plenty of problems on the web to make some progress.

Finally, continue playing a lot and get commentaries (you can ask me more questions by e-mail if there are some open questions left after this very commentary). And most of all, enjoy it!]
