C[Hallo,
This is a game was played in a League. I usually never think about games that long, so I think it's a good game for a review. Also I just won the game due to a mistake of my opponent in the endgame.
White is a german 3k, I have no proper rank but play around 1k on KGS.

I wrote some questions in the beginning but am happy about any comment. (Probably mainly concerning the direction of play) This is the first game I send to the GTL.

JS: Hi, my name is JÃ¼rgen Suntinger. I come from Austria and got promoted to 3D just at the last European Go Congress 2008 in Sweden. I hope you can improve while reading my comments and have a lot of fun playing this beautiful game]

(;W[pr]C[JS: The slide by white is a little bit strange, fixing the shape too much]
;B[qq]LB[qq:B][pr:A]C[here I was thinking of playing around n4 but was afraid of ending ins gote while k16 still seems like a huge point I wanted to get.

JS: Stabilising the corner is good for black in this situation. The A,B exchange by white not only loses the possibility of taking the whole corner by invading directly at B, but also makes the white stones a little bit heavy]

(;W[jp];B[jd]C[I like my position so far, as I find k4 strange

JS: True];W[pf];B[qe];W[qf];B[nd];W[re];B[rd];W[rj]C[Here I never know what the best way is]

(;B[qk]C[I was not too happy, but at least he is on the 2nd line]
;W[qi];B[rk];W[pi]
(;B[de]TR[dp][jp]C[Is this move correct at this point?
I usually play this move if I can because I am afraid of the shimari :)

JS: Playing a kakari cannot be bad when all corners are already occupied. The high kakari which you played is also especially good in this situation because the center is interesting for white and she has no effective pincer against it

JS: The two marked stones indicate that white is going to play a moyo game because the hoshi can be easily invaded. So the center and especially the left side is more important for white]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc]
(;B[dj]C[Here I was not completely happy since this shape I usually play when I can build a moyo which is not really possible in this game any longer]
;W[cl]C[JS: This is a good point for white];B[hq]C[I played this to explore m3 weakness, but after playing it I felt it probably was a mistake. Should I go for 3-3 invasion instead?

JS: I think your idea is good and better than immediatly invading the corner, because you make miai of playing at the left and the right side]
;W[jq];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr];B[ep];W[do];B[ho]TR[jp][jq][nq]
[pr]C[JS: This result is good for black because the shape of the 4 marked stones looks even stranger]
;W[ld]
(;B[lc]C[JS: This move usually is not good for black];W[mc]
;B[md];W[kc];B[lb];W[kd];B[kb];W[jc]TR[jd]C[JS: Black is playing against his marked stone]
;B[rf]C[I played this because I thought I need to defend the r17 peep and this seemed to be the most active way to do so.

JS: The problem is, that this sequence is not really sente]
;W[rg];B[se]
(;W[rh]C[JS: Not neccesary by white];B[jb];W[ib];B[mo];W[mp]
;B[eo];W[oj];B[ok];W[mf];B[nj];W[oi]C[I guess this is an important point to look for better direction than I did.]

(;B[id]C[JS: This just creates a weak group which black at best would like to throw away :-)]
;W[ic]
(;B[ge]TR[id][jd]C[here I felt like I began to struggle

JS: Maybe you are too fixed on securing the two marked stones :-)]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[ee]
(;B[gg]C[I played this sequence because I was afraid of a white territory in the middle.

JS: Your position is very thin but not easy to calculate];W[dh]
;B[ch]C[This move was probably not possible... I got lucky]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[di];B[ci];W[ei];B[cg]C[Now I created two weak groups which will ultimatively harm e5 group as well.]

;W[nk];B[ol];W[hd];B[he];W[qr]C[JS: The last big endgame point. It is amazing, but it makes a difference of 16 points wheater you, or your opponent gets to play this move. Now the position looks quite equal, maybe a little bit better for white]

(;B[hb]C[JS: You loose this nice endgame just getting two heavy stones]
))
(;W[jb]C[JS: White can simply tenuki and thake the big parts elsewhere on the board because the white group on the right is ready to run to the center if she gets any problems]
))
(;B[nc]C[JS: If you want to defend the corner then this is the right choice. White will not continue to play there immediately, but can regard his move as a forcing move reducing the black territory]
)
(;B[me]C[JS: If you want to attack this stone this is the usual way]
;W[le];B[lf];W[lb]LB[ic:A][oc:B]C[JS: But this is a good move for white worth remembering. It makes miai of sliding to A or invading with B]
;B[nb];W[ic];B[kf]C[JS: So black probably gets some influence on the outside which is unfortunately not very usefull because the white group on the right is already very stable]
))
(;B[cn]
(;W[fp];B[dj]LB[cn:A][fp:B]C[JS: This would be the dream variation of black. Having the A,B exchange makes this a good combination]
)
(;W[dj]C[JS: But white will probably not let get away so easily, creating a difficult possition]
))
(;B[cj]C[JS: Therefore black normaly extends with a low move because it is more stable]
))
(;B[ce]TR[dh]C[JS: If black plays the low kakari then a white pincer around the marked intersection makes a good combination with the white's left bottom. That is the reason why you play a low kakari, when the center and left side is not so important and a high one like in your game, when it is]
))
(;B[qj]C[JS: This is the standard way of dealing with the large slide]
;W[ri]C[JS: White has to come back];B[rk];W[qh]C[JS: White is not alive yet, which is very important. So black can wait for his chance to take use of it]
))
(;W[kq]TR[nq][pr]C[JS: White cannot treat the two marked stones lightly, so he has to play a save extension]
))
(;W[jp]LB[qq:A]C[JS: Normally white makes a big jump to the left keeping the possibility of invading the right corner at A]
