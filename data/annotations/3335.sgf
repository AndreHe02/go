C[Hi! I'm SÃ©bastien Moulin, a 2 dan French player. I'll do my best to review your game. The general impression is that you had an easy game but made several slips in the endgame.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[jd]LB[hc:B]
[ic:A]TR[db][cc]C[Black goes wrong here. Correct shape is at A to make a base. Now there is a severe invasion point at B. If Black wants to develop faster and play K16, he should do this immediately without making the marked exchange.This exchange deprives him of the 3-3 point invasion and makes B a troublesome weakness.]
;W[np]LB[nq:A]C[There is no reason to play high. The normal approach move on this side is at A, which is better related to follow-up moves like the 3-3 point invasion. Ones plays high only when the center is very important (in big moyo games) or when the high approach move breaks a ladder. Here I can't see any reason to play high, it just loses points compared to the normal approach move.]
;B[lq]LB[pn:A]C[This may be unnecessarily complicated, A is enough. If Black plays A he should be happy with the exchange.]
;W[qn];B[nq];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp]C[Black played submissively without trying to separate White's stones so White should be happy with this result.]
;B[po];W[rn]LB[rm:A]C[Probably better at A.];B[pj]LB[pn:A]C[The push at A is very big to spoil Black's framework. Maybe it is good to play here immediately for White.]
;W[ck]C[In contrast, this move looks slow, only trying to make territory... Well, it may also defend the upper group so it is not so bad.]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[ip]LB[cq:A][dr:B]TR[ck]C[This looks too close to black strength, maybe it is better to invade at A so as to turn the marked stone into a bad move. In any case, protecting the corner territory with B for White, or invading at A for black, is very big since the marked stone is played.]
;W[om]LB[pn:A]C[Good direction, but the push at A should be better because it leaves no weakness.]
;B[nn];W[qf]TR[pj]C[Good move, the marked stone is isolated.]
;B[qh]
(;W[pg]TR[qh]C[This is heavy, the marked black stone is right on the vital point to destroy White's eyes. The fight is not reasonable, see variation for an alternative..]
;B[re];W[ph];B[qi];W[rf];B[ql]LB[pn:A]C[Now it should be clear the push at A was a better shape for White.]
;W[pn];B[qe];W[oi];B[nk];W[nm];B[ok]LB[mj:A]C[Very slow move! This is almost like passing. Black could escape with A instead without fear of being cut.]
;W[mi]C[Good move, this is a running fight between black and white groups so this point is essential.]
;B[lk];W[nd]LB[oe:A]C[This looks like a strong attack, but one should read what happens if black resists with A.]

(;B[nc]C[But Black plays submissively again. Moves that try only to surround territory without attacking and trying to separate the opponent's groups are usually bad.]
;W[mc];B[oc];W[md];B[oe];W[mf];B[qc]C[Very slow and submissive, Black was already alive.]
;W[hc]C[Very good! White has a strong wall to back up this attack now. Black has almost lost the game.]
;B[hd];W[ic];B[id];W[gc];B[fd];W[gd];B[ge];W[jc];B[ff];W[cb]
LB[dr:A]C[This is big, but smaller than A. On the other hand Black's group is still weak so C18 is an attacking move.]
;B[ci]LB[cq:A]C[This is not good, Black already has a weak group around and he creates another one, in an area where White is strong. The natural way to reduce White's territory was the invasion at A, which lives immediately without creating another weak group.]
;W[dj];B[eh];W[eg];B[dh];W[fg]C[Black is neatly cut.];B[kf]
;W[fh];B[mg];W[nf];B[lg];W[hg];B[kd];W[kc];B[nh];W[ng];B[ni]
;W[nj];B[oj];W[fi]LB[cg:A]C[Maybe a move at A is a better way to remove aji. Black can't escape anyway.]
;B[mh]LB[pf:A]C[Black can now cut by ko at A so White must not play too passively to keep his lead.]
;W[oo];B[mn];W[on];B[mp]
(;W[bg]LB[dr:A]C[White is ahead, so it is safe to add a move around here. Playing at A instead is the normal move, but it looks as if Black can do something on the side (see variations).]
;B[cq]C[Very big.];W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[cr];W[fb];B[eb];W[gb]
;B[ed];W[dc];B[ec];W[eq];B[fr];W[er];B[es];W[fp];B[hq];W[ho]
LB[qr:A]C[This is not so big, it is difficult to surround territory in the center. A is urgent for White because there is sente yose for both sides in this area.]
;B[hm];W[io];B[gp];W[go];B[fo]
(;W[ep]C[Bad move, saving an useless stone. Now White is cut and loses a lot, this is a kind of "game losing move".]

;B[jn];W[jh];B[in];W[qr];B[pr];W[ps];B[os];W[qs];B[nr]C[This double sente yose was very big.]
;W[se]C[This is not big because White has no territory here. Black was not going to play here anyway.]

;B[cl];W[bm];B[dl];W[bl];B[en];W[co];B[ej];W[ei];B[dk];W[cj]
;B[fj];W[gj];B[fl]C[Black made an unexpected territory in this area. Now the game is close.]
;W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[pb];W[kn]C[This doesn't work, it can be cut and White will lose points.]
;B[km];W[lm];B[kl];W[mm];B[ln];W[gk];B[fk];W[jl];B[ki];W[ji]
;B[kj];W[da];B[rm]C[Much bigger than D19.];W[sm];B[sl];W[sn]
;B[qg];W[pf]TR[qg]C[Terrible exchange for Black, he could cut by playing Q14 himself and fighting the ko!]

;B[ie];W[br]LB[ap:A][bq:B]C[This doesn't work and it loses one point (because Black has to play B anyway in answer to White A). As the game is very close it is very important to read before playing moves like this!]
;B[bq];W[le];B[ke];W[me];B[li];W[jg];B[jo];W[hp];B[gq];W[ap]
;B[iq]C[Unnecessary move. The white stones above have only two liberties, there is nothing.]
;W[of];B[pk];W[jk];B[kk]TR[ep]C[In this game, White was far ahead because Black played many submissive moves. But White made various mistakes in the endgame and the final result was close. This shows how it is difficult to "win a won game". If you pay more attention to details in the endgame, I'm sure you can improve your level by one or two stones.
The marked stone was probably the worst move of the game and this kind of mistake can be avoided easily.]
