;B[qd]C[Hi, reviewer.

I lost this game by 25 points, and didn't make any obvious big blunders. I thi
nk my biggest problem was in how I handled the group on the right side. Let me
 know what you think.

Norman

Hi Norman,

here is the review. I emphasized the necessity of counting, I really believe you need a plan to win the game as a whole not only a slightly better result here and there. If you are falling behind you need a path to turn it around for continuing when you don't see anything to try then resign. It is really better to try to turn a game around and "die trying" than to calmly play it to the inevitable loss at the end.

Good luck and kind regards Tapir.];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc]
(;W[qj]C[Is this the right move on this side, or should I play at R9 or R11 instead?

N: Move 6: I usually don't approach 3-4 points because I don't know many of the joseki involved. How much worse is it to just play in the middle of the side like this? Should I make joseki study a priority? Should I play the approach moves even without knowing the joseki? The other day, I talked to a 6 dan who said he barely knows any joseki, so I am confused as to how to approach them. I know a bunch of 44 joseki, but the 34 joseki intimidate me with all their lengthy variations.

R: Well, obviously I am not a 6 dan. But you both rely on joseki (trying to punish mistakes etc.) and are afraid of them (didn't study approaches) - in my experience studying joseki is a good way to be less reliant on single joseki and allows you to play more actively and according to your plans and gives you more options to consider. And finally, it really crushes the idea that there ever is THE joseki. 

If you don't approach 3-4 points a good starting point is the high approach. The worst thing that can happen is that you learn something new (and lose a game in the process).]
;B[qn]C[R: Very convenient for Black - two corner enclosures. I would have played an approach to the lower right corner. Doesn't really matter which one.]
;W[qg]C[R: Now, imagine Black at A.]
(;B[cn]C[R: Feels like wrong direction.]
(;W[fq]C[R: Automatic response?];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[jp]C[R: If you plan to continue playing locally better F3 at F4 and K4 at K3.]
;B[lq]C[R: Good checking extension. Large, solidifies the corner, takes away white follow up and exposes the open door K4 left.]
;W[jc];B[lc];W[cg];B[cc];W[dc];B[bd]C[Well, this is not joseki. I'm not sure of the best way to punish it. I figured that rather than try something risky, I'd just play C15 and get a result about the same as the joseki.

R: In my opinion obsessing about "punishing" just leads to looking for local moves. + There usually isn't a single but many joseki possible in a situation. (http://senseis.xmp.net/?JosekiChoice)

R: I would consider taking sente after the next two moves.]

N: Move 31: I still feel like I don't understand what happened here and in the next few moves very well.]
;W[qi];B[pg]
(;W[ph];B[oh];W[qh];B[pf];W[oi];B[pj]C[R: Strange play by Black imo.]
(;W[pk]LB[oi:B][qi:A]C[R: What is your aim here?

N: Move 40: My aim is to keep my stones working together as one group. In the line of play you suggest, it seems that I allow myself to be separated and let my main group be cut off from the center. I guess it lives though. I always worry that I'll mess up a life and death calculation or spend too much of my time trying to figure it out, so I'd rather connect my group out to the center. But I guess in this case I really had to take the time to figure it out.

R: But your A and B stones don't work together in your line because you simply sacrifice B here and more importantly you don't produce any targets for a later attack. Go isn't an exact science at my level, you see. :) But I would say it is about balance, when you play solid, but give the opponent rock solid groups everywhere in return, it isn't to your advantage.]

(;B[ni];W[nj];B[oi];W[mk];B[ql]
(;W[qk]C[R: Black might not be very efficient, but is solid every. As Black is ahead in definite territory,  This really makes it harder for you to build a moyo.]
;B[mj];W[nk];B[lj]LB[nn:A][np:B]TR[oh][ni][mj]SQ[mk][nk][ok]
[pk]C[Now I have trouble judging my group on the right side. Is it weak or st
rong? It has a lot of liberties, but doesn't have definite life yet, and there
 are a lot of black stones on the bottom right menacing it.

R: Compare your square stones to the triangle stones, which do more work? 

R: Exchanging S15 for S16 would help the group even if not followed up instantly.

N: Move 51: It's not clear to me which of the marked groups of stones is doing more work. Black's stones are creating a nice moyo, but on the other hand, he has 4 more stones next to them in a square dumpling shape doing almost no work. My stones are reducing black's potential in the bottom right. Which group do you think is doing more work, and why?

R: Keep in mind you later exchanged A for B. In the end you made exactly one eye and one point of territory there (And yes, Black isn't efficient either.)]
(;W[je]C[This moyo boundary move looked very important];B[jg]
(;W[ig]C[I thought that if we both made walls here, I would have a slightly bigger moyo, but maybe this was not a very good move.

R: Did you count?

N: Move 53: Good point about counting. I do try to make a habit of counting, but I don't always remember to do so. Now that I count, I see that my previous analysis was wrong.

R: I don't find this move particularly bad. The more obvious mistakes came later, but tried to emphasize that "I make a slightly bigger moyo here" isn't a good argument, if it disregards the overall count, e.g. if slightly bigger isn't enough.

N: Please comment on my other move ideas. Now that I have tried counting, I think that if I play 
M15, then the score is approximately as follows.

Solid territory:
Black: 18 points in top right, 20 points in bottom right, 8 points on left side, 4 points in top left

White:18 points on top, 10 points on the bottom, 7 points on right side, 6.5 points komi

Potential territory and influence: about even? 

On the other hand, if I successfully invade at o3, and capture M3, it would give me more than 20 points of territory while reducing black's potential, which should be very good even in gote. If I don't capture M3 but successfully invade, then the level of success depends greatly on whether I end in sente or not. 

I think M15 has less potential for a big swing, but is a safer move. It looks like it's worth about  15 points of territory reduction in gote. But I'm not confident with that -- it's hard to count center territory. There might be some other moves I could play first in sente. Since I am behind, maybe o3 is necessary. But my endgame skill should allow me to make up a few points, so maybe M15 is better

R: I don't count 10 points in the bottom left for White. B3 is afaik more than 15 points in gote, if M15 is only 15 points small you should consider B3 too. (But I think it is bigger because of the follow up on the upper edge, either way it would have been still available but you lost a move at K12.) O3 looks most convincing, but you can't expect to invade and to kill M3, that would be wishful thinking.]
