Hi, my name is Eric and I am playing  black under the pseudonym Pilgrim.   The final score was B: 46.0 and W: 43.5

Hi Eric, my name is Thomas. I am not used to play 13x13 games and this is the first review I make. I still hope I can give some useful comments.
My comments will be preceeded by #tomjk#. (This is my account name on KGS)]
;B[jj]LB[kk:A]SQ[jd][kd][je][ke][jf][kf][jg][kg][jh][kh][dj]
[ej][fj][gj][hj][dk][ek][fk][gk][hk]C[#tomjk# With this move Black expresses interest at extensions on both sides. It has though a weakness at "A", as White can invade there.
There would be two additional moves necessary to secure any territory in this corner for Black.]
;W[di]LB[ed:B][cj:A]TR[cd][dd][ce][de][cf][df][cg][dg]SQ[dj]
[dk][dl]C[#tomjk# This move emphasise the left side and aims at building outside influence if Black wants the corner (for example with a play at round "A"). This move seems not so favourable to me, since there is the Black stone, which hampers any good development if a white Wall materializes along the squared points. See also the variations. This white move would be better at "B", since there is no Black stone in the directions White wants to develop.]

(;B[ic]LB[jd:A][cj:B]TR[jj]C[#tomjk# This move does not work well together with the marked stone. Since the marked stone aimed to extend towards "A", why not play on "A" when you have the chance to do so?. Both black stones feel to stay on their own. It is always a good idea to look for moves to have your stones work together. Another possible move would be "B" because of the questionable move from White.]
;W[fk]LB[dc:A][gk:B][hk:C][kk:D]TR[ic]C[This move seemed strange for white, leaving the corner open.  How could I invade the bottom left corner?  I need to learn how to invade.

#tomjk# Yes this move does not look so good. I think the idea was to help against an invasion from Black in this corner. But White should stick to his plan and extend now towards "A". Especially as this is the direction in which Black wants to play with his marked stone. "Play where your opponent wants to play" is often a good idea.
This actual move is questionable because it extends into a direction where Black already has a stone, and therefore White can not expect to get much there.
A move at "B" or "C" instead would be better as it threatens an invasion with "D"., but it does not work well with the other white stone.
You are right, that the corner is still not secure (see variation for a possible approach from Black), but on the other hand White can not secure the corner with just one move, so not securing the corner for the moment is ok :)]

(;B[hk]LB[cc:A][kd:B]TR[ic]SQ[jj]C[#tomjk# A slow move, aiming to defend the corner. The problem is, that an invasion is still possible.
Maybe a better idea would be to play in the empty corner at  "A" (works together with the triangled marked stone) or at "B" (works with the triangled and squared stone) which aims at "A" as next move and then wait what White does. I personally would play "B".]
;W[de]LB[dc:C][dd:B][df:A][dg:D]C[#tomjk# Maybe better at "A" (solid play) or at "B" or "C" (more ambitious play). This move feels like a move "in between", which is open to attack at "D" and does not put claim into the corner.]
;B[ed]LB[dd:B][ee:A]TR[di]C[What do you think of this move?  I liked it since it built the top area and kept influence on the center.

#tomjk# Your move looks fine to me as it attacks the white stone, so I think that White will respond at "A" (if he wants the side - would work very well with the marked white stone) or at "B" to claim part of the corner. I think "B" is best here ... Black will take either "A" or "B" depending on what White plays.]
;W[jg]LB[dd:A][kd:B][dg:C]C[#tomjk# This play is a little bit early. This move should be "A" or "B". Now Black can play "A" or "B" and wait what White does. After Black "A" Black can aim at "C".]
;B[je]LB[dd:C][kd:A][lj:B][kk:D]TR[jg]C[#tomjk# A strong move which attacks the marked white stone. Only it does not close the corner, so I personally would prefer to play "A" now, taking profit in the corner and see what White does, (aiming to take again profit with "B".
 Also "C" is an option for Black. But the actual move is a good move in any case. Black should always take into consideration the weakness of the right lower corner (at "D").]
;W[hh];B[hg]LB[ih:A][kj:C][kk:B]TR[jg][hh]SQ[jj][hk]C[I also did this to keep influence on the center.

#tomjk# This moves puts immediate pressure on the marked white stones. The problem is, that if White "A", the White stones get stronger and the marked Black stones get weaker (then after an invasion at "B" the Black stones don't have any base).  To me it seems that now closing of one of the corners seems to get more urgent, i.e. make a secure base from which to fight. So Black should now play first "C"and then aim at attacking the marked white stones.

My impression is that both players have their stones somehow drifting around without a base.]
;W[ig]LB[ih:A]TR[jj][hk]C[#tomjk# Normally this move should be at "A" and normally Black can now cut at "A", because the ladder is in favour for Black. The problem here however is the weakness of the marked black stones, so a direct cut at "A" is not an advantage for Black.
This move complicates unnecessarily the situation for White.]
;B[ih];W[ii]
(;B[gh]LB[jh:A]C[#tomjk# White can take now the marked Black stone with "A". I think which is the best move here now - see also variation.]

(;W[hi]TR[ih]C[#tomjk# The connection is also very good, it builds thicknes to later attack the corner.]
;B[fg]TR[jj][hk]SQ[ig][jg]C[#tomjk# Black plays on the "correct" side, i.e. does not reinforce White towards the marked black stones, but the fact that Black cannot capture the two marked white stones is a major setback for Black. Black has now a weak group in the center and a troublesome group in the corner ...]
;W[hf];B[gg]LB[fe:B][if:A]TR[hg]SQ[ih]C[#tomjk# Black makes heavy shape ... but he aims at the cut at "A". A light move would be "B", but here Black needs to fight now, since he is behind.]
;W[gj]C[#tomjk# Good move, which connects the white stones and increases pressure on the corner.]

(;B[dg]C[That move almost looks unnecessary to me now.

Perhaps L6? Or invade lower left corner?

#tomjk# As this move keeps the white stones on the left side separated it helps the black group in the center. Due to the possible cut at "A" Black can still connect to the top. So this moves looks ok to me.
After L6, White will play K6 and then whatever Black does, White will invade one of the two black corners ... (see variation)
Before thinking to invade the white corner it would be best first to secure the Black center group, since White gets after the invasion a strong outside wall which could be deadly to a weak center group.]
;W[ef];B[jh]LB[kh:B][ji:A][ki:C]C[#tomjk# Better at "A" which helps the corner and is sente. "B" is gote, as White captures and then Black "C" to defend the corner.]
;W[ji];B[kh]LB[kj:A]C[Yeah I think L6 earlier would've been better. :P

I gave white too much in this sequence.

#tomjk# Yes, but now better at "A".]
(;W[kg]LB[ki:A]TR[ih][jh][kh]C[#tomjk# White is too kind here and should  play now at "A" instead, thus taking the corner (see variation) and threatening to capture the marked Black stones (as in the actual game later).]
;B[ki];W[kj];B[if]C[Should I have done M8 instead?  J8 seems important so white would not push north.  I probably would lose more points if I did not do J8, huh?

#tomjk# The problem is that there are now three weak Black groups. It is correct to start to save one of them. J8 gets for the time being the center group out of trouble. So this is an important point, yes.]

(;W[li]LB[dd:C][le:B][eg:D][lj:A]TR[ig][jg][kg]C[It seems white could've done M9, D10, C10, C6, or G2 instead of M5.

#tomjk# White should be at M4 "A", capturing the four Black stones and most probably taking the corner as well. M9 "B" can be played after White has played "A".

You are right that D10 "C" is big, but first maybe White should cut at "D", in the insuing escape of the black center group white will surely find time to play "C".
D10 is better than C10, Instead of C6 White should defend the corner with C3 first. G2 is not necessary yet, first White plays M4.]
;B[lj]LB[kk:A]C[#tomjk# Black takes the key point at M4 and may have now a chance to live in the corner ... but White at "A" can spoil this effort ... (see variation).]

(;W[lh]C[#tomjk# White misses his chance ...];B[kk];W[ki];B[lk]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[ik];B[il];W[ij];B[he]LB[dd:B][kd:A][ck:C]C[Was H9 fine or should I have played L1?  I havent's studied that much on life-and-death, although my lower right group eventually lives (barely).    Was there a way for white to invade my lower right since I did not play L1?

#tomjk# An interesting life & death problem ;-) It looks to me though as if  Black is alive, because of the possible move at G2.
H9 is not necessary, as in any case Black can capture the marked white stone. Black is now behind in the game, it is difficult to decide which one of the big plays at "A", "B", or "C" is now to play. "B" looks biggest to me.]
;W[lm]LB[mj:B][gl:A]C[White does this to invade, but it seemed to me that I had plenty of space to deal with in the corner.

#tomjk# You are right. White can now only reduce the corner territory and leave the scene in sente making a big move elsewhere ... anyway, White should start with "A" and then hane at "B" and not putting his own stones into Blacks territory. There is a saying that there is "death in the hane". So often the first play is a hane to kill a group, later the placement.]
;B[kl]C[L2 seemed very necessary to me. :)

#tomjk# Also M2 or L1 or G2 are good. White can not cut at L2 (White L2, Black M2, White L1, Black K1 ...) Best is here probably G2 now.]
;W[mj];B[gl]C[I thought G2 would give me a good extension to ensure life, but it didn't.  The upside is that it pushes a bit into the left corner.

#tomjk# Good thinking :) G2 is a good move.

What would be a better move?
H2 seems better than N3.

G2 does prevent the cut, and push into the left.  So maybe is fine. :)]
;W[fl]C[Hmm that seems to only help white.   Perhaps if I had done H2 instead of G2, then jump to F2?  That would be better I think.

In this position, can I still invade the lower left corner at C3?  Or is it too late?

#tomjk# An invasion seems diffcult now.];B[fm];W[em];B[hm]C[Whoops I meant G1.

#tomjk# Yes Black G1 is sente, as White needs to reply to protect the cut at E2.]
;W[gm];B[mk];W[fm];B[gk]C[Another worthless move on my part.

#tomjk# This was anyway a false eye. You could have played elsewhere, since your group is unconditionally alive. K1 and L1 are miai (if White takes one of these points, Black takes the other).]
;W[jm];B[km];W[mm]C[#tomjk# No threat to Black. Black can now play elsewhere.]
;B[hl]C[Phew! I found life.  That sequence wasn't so favorable though.

#tomjk# This move was not necessary, as you can play this move when White plays H4 and Black will still be alive. Even after White H4 Black could play elsewhere (if the move is bigger than 6 points. If White captures then at H2, Black just connects at J1 and lives.
You missed an opportunity to make a big move elsewhere.];W[hj]
LB[dd:B][kd:A][eg:D][dh:F][eh:E][ck:C]C[White didn't need to do this I think, and could've beaten me if he found life in the upper left portion of the board.

#tomjk# Yes, a wasted move. White could have invaded at "A", played "B" or defended the corner at "C". Remember that White always can play the sequence White "D", Black "E" and White "F" to take profit on the side.]
;B[dd]C[#tomjk# Good move!];W[eg]C[Good move for white here, but I think I really needed to play D10.  Is that correct?

#tomjk# Yes, D10 was correct, the biggest move on the board I would say.]

(;B[eh]C[Any move better than this? F5?

#tomjk# C9 looks better to me. ;-) (see variation)];W[dh]
(;B[ee]LB[ce:A]C[I should've saved E9 for later and played M8, huh?  It seems I would lose more points if white played L9 or M9 instead of E9.

#tomjk# Better maybe is "A" (see variation).];W[df]C[Now it seems I have no chance on the lower left. :P

#tomjk# How about the sequence in the variation?]
(;B[ff]LB[cd:A]C[This seemed good, but I still think I should have played M8, since I would only lose a few points if white played F8 (since I would follow with G8, then white stuck).

#tomjk# F8 is good, but first Black can play all the moves as in the previous variation. So "A" is more urgent now.]
;W[cg]LB[cd:A][kd:B]C[Could I have invaded at C7?    If white then connected at D7, then I would extend to C8, then white C9, then black B9 and crawl from there to life?    But this would give white influence on my upper moyo.    I would though, have C5 or C6 left to push south.

#tomjk# No, C7 would be not good. Black should still simply play "A", but White does not need to respond now with the same urgency as before, since C7 guards. "A" also closes the corner. After "A" White could now invade at "B".]
;B[ei];W[ej];B[lf]C[Ah, there is M8.  I finally play it! :)

#tomjk# Good move. :)];W[jf]LB[ke:A]C[#tomjk# White could play more severe with "A".]
;B[ie];W[mi]LB[cd:B][ke:A]C[#tomjk# Too small, best move is now "A" or "B".]
;B[cd]C[Is C10 the best move?  If not, what is better?

#tomjk# Yes, best move now. Very good!];W[ke]C[Well I could have played at L9 like white just did, but I would lose more if I played L9 instead of C10.  Is that correct?

#tomjk# Yes, C10 was bigger.];B[kd];W[le];B[ld];W[me];B[be]
TR[ke][le][me]C[C9 better than B9 here?

#tomjk# Black must play N10 first (this is sente). If White does not respond, Black can play L8 and capture the three marked stones. As the situation is now, White can ignore the Black move and play N10 in sente (see variation).]

(;W[bf];B[af];W[ag];B[ae];W[bg]LB[md:A]C[#tomjk# A wasted move, White must play now "A".]
;B[md]C[#tomjk# Good! :)];W[mf]C[#tomjk# You see, White must respond, so Black could have played this earlier.]
;B[ge]LB[ce:A]C[#tomjk# I don't think White can do anything here yet. So Black could play "A" instead.]
;W[fi];B[fh];W[gi];B[ce]C[#tomjk# Ok. Black got this point anyway ;-)]
;W[cf];C[
Overall I thought I only won because white didn't see the weak spots I left open.

Thank you VERY much for your help.

#tomjk# This was an interesting game.
The beginning was characterized by both players playing rather vaguely in the center neglecting to secure any corners or set up a base for their groups. Surely not my way to play, but probably playable - and again I have not much experience on 13x13 boards to judge the pro and cons ;-)
Later White build up a good position by capturing four important black stones, but failed to take the resulting opportunities and to pick up the big points later.
Black had the better eye for the big points in the middle game and endgame, picked them up one after the other and could thus decide the game for himself.

I hope you find something helpful in my comments.
