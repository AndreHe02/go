This review is by droid 8k* from igs, and was requested by kicker 19k*  who played white.

mani 19k*, playing black, won by 10.5 points.

Before proceding, my standard disclaimer:  All comments following are  made in good humor with all the humility required of a kyu level player.   Hopefully neither player will take offense to any of the commentary as  none is intended.  Perhaps some of this will be instructive and fun for  relative beginners.

In summary, black played a better opening and early middle game than  white.  He had a significant lead on the board, and stronger positions  everywhere.  However, black then played some bad 'desparation' type  fighting moves for no reason, and gave the lead back to white, and lost a  large group of stones at the top.  By luck, black found a way to save his  stones at the top at the last minute and won by a small margin.  He was  lucky!

White should try to create fewer weak groups in the early part of a game.   He was spread very thin in this game, and should have lost.  His  agressive nature is positive but dangerous.

Black, who was in a very strong position at the beginning of the game,  should learn to understand when he is strong, and then attack white  methodically only where white is weak.  Black had no reason to attack  white so agressively at the top in this game.  He almost lost the game  this way.]
BL[564];W[pd]WL[568];B[pq]BL[555];W[dd]C[While I can't  say D16 is bad by white, I would probably prefer white to try an approach  to the lower right corner (Q5 maybe).

Allowing black to play Q-R5 next seems too easy on black already.  If  then white approaches the bottom left around E4, then black would get a  good double purpose pincer/extension around G4.  If Black Q5 then white  in the middle at K3-4, then black F3 solidifes the bottom right and  compels white to play at 04 immediately, so then blacks result is good -  solidifying both corners, attacking white, and getting sente to approach  the top before white completes a sanren-sei (white at K16).

However, this is more personal opinion than anything  else.]
WL[561];B[qn]C[Black gets one enclosure.  Will he get  two?]
BL[539];W[jd]C[White sets up a sanren-sei at the top.  This is an  attacking formation, and white hopefully is planning a good fight  elsewhere on the board.  To rely on the top as territory would be bad  planning by white.]
WL[553];B[cf]BL[510]
(;W[fd]C[This is probably the best non-pincer response to c14 in  this case.  Good for white to at least avoid playing C15 or D14 here.

I would consider however, trying a pincer play around D11 perhaps.  If  black follows by invading the upper right corner at C17 then white would  come out in good shape.  Or if black would jump to E14, still white would  be good I think - see variations in game  tree.]

;B[ep]C[
I don't like this by black.  I think black would be better off with a  pincer - around J3 - H4 probably.

C11 seems just a bit too far away and too low to help sufficiently, so  black will probably (eventually) need another stone around D9 or D8  which is inefficient.  If white gets sente he stands to get to a big  point at Q10 first.]
BL[422]

;B[jq]C[
Black has gained here.  White has made a mistake in this corner -  starting at C3.  White is very weak and has little territory in this  corner.]
BL[377];W[hq]C[Low and slow.  White is in a bad position, but  perhaps can get some escape to center with g4 instead?]
WL[397]
(;B[mp]C[Black would get better result by playing K4 or K5 here  I think.   It is better to make "box like" shapes - strong and bigger.

Good also  I believe, would be for black to play G5 before white does.  See variation]
BL[358]
(;W[pj]C[Good for white to aggressively go for the big point.   However, I feel in this case like white needs to settle his bottom group  which is in danger.  White at G5 would be a good  start.]
WL[372];B[qf]C[This seems to invite white to play Q14 or R15  which are probably ok for black in this position.]
BL[300];W[rd]C[Too  passive I think.  White in this case can consider R15 since he has a  stone at Q10.  He can also consider Q14 with Q10 and K16 in place.  Then  with sente, he can strengthen his bottom and build his top  moyo.]
WL[358];B[qi]C[Too low perhaps.]BL[273];W[rg]C[Low and small.   Black is not severely threatened, since running towards middle with R14  or R11 will also weaken white at  Q10.]
WL[338];B[qg]BL[247];W[of]C[Good - white should have played this  instead of S13 I think.]
WL[302];B[pi]BL[243];W[oj]WL[292];B[oi]BL[242];W[ni]C[White must be careful not to create another weak group  to attack on the board.  He is still in danger at the  bottom.]
WL[287];B[nj]BL[196];W[nh]C[Good for building moyo at top  perhaps, but consider black's enormous right side if black plays O9  next.]

;B[ri]BL[182];W[rf]C[White is weaker at Q10 than black is weak at Q11  group.  So white should probably try to save Q10 stones first (or use  them for sabaki / sacrifice).  S14 is small at this point - potentially  big mistake.]
WL[194];B[qk]C[
Ouch - now black is alive on side.  I think black is ahead.  White top  area is huge, but black can reduce starting from N10 stone.

Black's right side is also huge, and harder for white to reduce.  Also  black can attack white bottom stones and get big gains on left side or  bottom.]
BL[173];W[ck]C[This will likely serve to create another weak white  group.  The balance of strength favors black on the board already.  White  should probably consider G5 instead.

White has a play at D13 to keep black low on right side, so I feel like  C9 is not urgent anyway.]
WL[108];B[cm]BL[130];W[ek]C[Black might look  to get splitting attack between E9 and G5  now.]
WL[95];B[cr]BL[128];W[er]WL[85];B[ei]C[
I prefer G5 to keep the pressure on white's bottom.  This will help black  build strength on left side while attacking the bottom.  After that, E11  will be a stronger  move.]
BL[113];W[bq]WL[75];B[br]BL[109];W[bp]C[After 50 moves, black  seems far ahead in this game.  Black has a very big area at the bottom  right and his stones are strong.  White has little chance to attack  there.  Black is also strong at the bottom left, while white is very weak  there.  This should give black good territory later on the left and  bottom as he harrasses white.

White is very big at the top, but there is room for black to reduce  white, since black is strong in the middle and white is not (the three  white stones at P10 are almost dead and this makes black strong at N10,  at R13, at bottom left).  Also, white is very weak at C9, and at the  bottom, and at Q10.  Therefore, black stands to get profitable attacks  against these groups.]

What about black at B9 instead?  This seems to set white adrift (without  base of eye space on side) in sente, with good followup potential for  black.]
BL[17];W[mm]C[Deep invasion - seems too deep now, but white is  desperate at this point.]

BL[777];W[nl]WL[672];B[ml]BL[776];W[nm]WL[670];B[jk]C[Good move by black.

White seems to have just donated more prisoners to black at N7 group.   How will these stones escape now?

This is good example of the care that must be taken in early fights.   When white created the weak group at Q10 earlier, he set up black to be  very strong with N10.  Now K9 threatens white on the left, the right, and  the bottom.  Also, K9 makes K14 stronger.  Black controls the middle.   Black has more territory than white.  Black is strong everywhere and  white has three very weak groups.  Black should have an easy  game.]
