C[Hello.
I want to have a review of this game because I thought that I
had done not major mistakes.
Please, look at the whole situation on board and my direction
of play.
I'm playing white.

Best regards,
Alexander Gilyazov (Gelya)



Reviewer: Hi. I'll call myself Rev.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[jj]C[I had problems in almost of all my games fuseki. And this move
made me think... But I think it gets out good for me.

Rev: Anything is possible in fuseki.];W[nc];B[kd];W[qc]

Rev: This move is sound.];B[oh]C[Rev: Bad because it attacks from the strong side.]
;W[pi];B[kc];W[rc];B[rd];W[oc]C[Here I thought white is better and black wall is facing nowhere.

Rev: Correct.];B[de]LB[fc:c][ee:b][fd:a]C[Where is better to answer? I definitely don't want to play A,
B or C.

Rev: A seems enough.]

Rev: Yes. Black should have played here first.];W[dg];B[eg]
;W[eh];B[dh];W[cg];B[ef]C[Rev: So bad.]
(;W[di]C[Maybe a little too soft?

Rev: A universe too soft.];B[fh];W[ei];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq]
;B[hp]
(;W[qq]C[Maybe its a bit too early?

Rev: Because you didn't stab into Black earlier, finding a move
for White is now rather hard.]

;W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[mr];W[rn]C[Slow?

side into solid territory.];W[ni];B[lh];W[gi];B[hh];W[nh];B[ng]

;W[dl];B[dk];W[cl]C[I count +20 for white, so I just wanted to fix solidly.

Rev: The game is still playable for both.];B[ek];W[ck];B[qh]
;W[rf];B[ql];W[qj]C[Again. Maybe these two of my moves are the reason I won only
2,5 points.

Rev: Maybe these two of Black's moves are the reasons you won.
They lose points and eliminate ko threats.];B[lm];W[em]
(;B[gl]C[Rev: Maybe another losing move. Protecting just 10 points.]
;W[fm];B[gk];W[hn];B[io]C[And here I want to ask the most interesting part of my game -
yose.
Can you show me where was good or bad plays in the endgame?

Rev: You played the yose well, without major mistakes. This is
the last comment.];W[cb];B[eb];W[kb];B[jb];W[lb];B[sc];W[sb]
