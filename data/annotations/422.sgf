Synopsis
========
I think this game revolved around thwarting W's plans for territory on the bottom side and isolating the center W group from it.  There were many missed occasions for working on this.  The record shows no indications of your clocks so I don't know what time pressure you were under.    You didn't seem able to take advantage of the early built B wall facing the center.

I hope this helps though I expect a Dan player would have better advice.
