[qo:b][nq:c][qq:d]C[It is good that you chose a 3,4 point.  these are efficient because only one more move at "a" encloses the corner.  The 4,4 points take two more moves, "b" and "c" and if you don't play it right, a black move at "d" can ruin a 4,4 corner.     It is true that 4,4 corners have better influence but using influence effectively is much harder than making territory.  From what I understand, 5 or 6 kyu and better have a good enough understanding of influence to use it well, people just learning like you and me (11 kyu) don't.]
;B[dj]C[black is all influence and no territory - with a few more games you will recognize how easily this can be cut up.]

(;W[kp]LB[pj:a][qj:b]C[too slow - if you want to make territory, this 4th line move doesn't do it.  The fourth line is for influence so if that is your aim, go at "a" or "b".]
;B[pj]LB[ql:a][qh:b]C[White is now split in two and the value of the star point on the right shows up clearly with black on that space.  White has no good way to attack black because black can move  R13 if white attacks at "a" or down to R7 if the attack comes from "b".      One way to chose moves, is to go where you would hate to see your opponent go.]
;W[on]LB[pn:a][qn:b][qm:c]C[Too slow and it doesn't protect your corner.  The attack should come from the top corner because the lonely white stone needs help.  to protect the corner, you should consider "a" or "b", even "c" though "c" would be more about local influence.]
;B[pg];W[pf]LB[qe:a]C[contact makes your openent stronger locally.  "a" would probably work better because black already has a firm base by now.  At this point, such straitforward attack will not help you.]
;B[qf];W[qe];B[rf];W[lc]LB[pe:a]C[you must protect the cutting point "a" - two many weaknesses are forming for white and black is getting strong.]
;B[jd];W[hp]LB[nd:a][le:b]TR[jd]C[This move does not correlate with the moves up top.  The top moves are building a moyo orbiting "a" but with the the marked stone threating it, you must protect.  Play "b".]
;B[jj]C[you have traded (a little) security in the corners for black influence everywhere.  From this point on, you must play very well.]

(;W[fn]C[this move invites black to make his next move.];B[dn]
C[which makes black stronger on the side.  Do not invite your opponent to create strong areas, invite him to create weakness, hoping to take advantage of it later.  Additionally, White's marked stone does build territory for white.  Consider the variation.]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[fq];B[er];W[fr];B[nf];W[of];B[og];W[ng]C[considering the situation, perhaps this was unreasonable]
;B[mg]LB[ne:a][pe:b][nc:c]TR[pf][of]C[black would be better at "a" because then "b" kills the marked group and to prevent that you would be forced to make heavy stones in the corner. So after you protect "b", black drops down to "c" and you have real trouble.  After the mess in the corner settles out, black can still probably come back and play this move (N13).]
