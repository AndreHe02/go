C[To my dear reviewer

Hi , I'm cb22 and playing black

I've played this game on IGS (10min/25stones) and lost it. I would like to know my biggest mistakes, because I felt I was winning and didn't at the end. Thanks for making my Go better :) and thanks for the review.

I'm a 6k KGS player but IGS is very different in style of play...

Hi Clement,

Thanks for the opportunity o review your game. It was very interesting and I hope my remarks and variations will help you to improve your game.

The main points are: 
- a better understanding of the opening, not necessarily joseki, but more how your stones work together and why you want to play a certain kind of opening.
- how to attack or more specifically how to build while attacking.
- Keeping sente, never stop thinking how to keep sente it's crucial!
- Improve your reading.

The above mentioned points will come back many times in the commemts and variations later on.

Another thing is to try to count, even estimate the score by comparing group size, it gives you a better idea of what you need to do.

 If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

Best regards,
Lothar.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[My favorite opening ^^]
;W[qf]C[Here I felt my opponent did a mistake. I hesitate with R12 but chose the O17 extension by the end.

This is a huge mistake and actually from here W should have a very difficult game to say the least.

W should have played K4/K3 or O17/O16.]
(;B[nc]C[Way to easy on W and it contradicts completely with the the whole idea of the Chinese opening.
R12 is an ideal extension and pincer from R9 don't even think twice about playing something else!

See your own var. and compare the board at move 12 in the actual game and in your var. Then I added move 13 that makes the moyo.

This is clearly the biggest mistake you made and instead of having an easy game punishing W's mistake (R14) you let W destroy your Chinese opening by playing O17. 

This is your favourite opening so make the most of it!];W[qi]

(;B[ok]C[I'd like this move at the beginning because I found it work well with the Q3 stone

I'ld prefer R15 which W will have to answer with Q14 and then P9. Now W will have an easy lfe with S16...]
;W[rd]
(;B[dj]C[Maybe I should have answer or close my south corner... don't know what would have been the best...

This is too slow. Look for the biggest point on the board. If you still want to make something of the Chinese opening play K4. W will invade Q5 etc. See var.]
;W[qo];B[rp]C[Think what you want to accomplish. You can either close white off (P5) and build a wall. Which then would enhance D10 and connect P9 or drive W into the center.]
;W[qp]C[W should play lightly into the center.];B[qq];W[ro]
;B[oo]C[Better late then never ;-) this is good.];W[rq];B[rr]
;W[sp];B[pn]C[Why oh why? If W wants to break out let him try to do so and B will build an even stronger wall because of that. Biggest move here is F4!]
;W[rm]C[Still an opportunity to play F4.];B[rl]C[Bad, it's way too small, and it induces W R7which has aji for W.]
;W[qm]
(;B[om]C[Here is a mistake no ? I wanted to connect my above stones but should I have played the big move of K4 instead ?

Your over concentrated. K4 is in the right direction but misses the philosophy of Go. Play away from strength and towards weakness. Now the strength is that wall that you built the weakness is that lonely stone at D4. Attack! 

There's no other move then F4!];W[jp]C[W here neutralizes you wall.]
;B[kq]C[Don't use a wall to creat territory! Though this may seem contradictionary to F4 but it's not. See the var. at move 25.

Instead of L3, which is gote, attack at C6 and then C14, both ideal extensions from D10.]
;W[jq];B[lq]C[You have to push back not give in.. M4 is the only move]
