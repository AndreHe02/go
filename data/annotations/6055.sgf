C[Hello, pls help me review this game. It started pretty fine (or so i think) but the end was quite frustrating....so I'd really know when it got bad...Thanks in advance. I'm playing white. My rank at the time was 3k


Hi, I'm Thomas (2d) doing this review for you.
I've marked my comments with an asterisk (*).];B[pd]C[Akenobie [3k?\]: hi]
;W[dp]C[vorpal [3k\]: Hi, thx for playing];B[pq]C[Akenobie [3k?\]: same here]
;W[cd];B[ed];W[ee]C[Uhm I didn't like the joseki here, but the old attach and extend at E 17 doesn't look that good to me.

* Both is fine. However you could avoid this black approach by playing C16 at another corner spot.]
;B[fe];W[ef];B[dd];W[ce];B[cc];W[bc];B[db]
(;W[dj]LB[bb:B][de:A]C[*This leaves some bad aji around A. Black can still cut there and also play B in sente.]
;B[bb];W[ff]C[* This is a thank-you-move. Black is one move ahead in this struggle and the cut is not yet really protected.]

(;B[ge]
(;W[pp]C[Uhm not really sure about Q4 but i dint know  wat to do here. Also the upper side looks kinda big for black.

* Contact plays are for getting weak stones stronger and close range combat. But the attacher always is one move behind in the struggle. I would really prefer a simple pattern like Q5. The next black move]
;B[oq]C[* Solid and good. You can't expect to get a nice result now.]

(;W[op]C[* This move is very bad. Letting hit "two stones at the head" by a hane is almost always bad and gets black a nice result here.]
;B[np];W[qq]
(;B[no];W[mq]C[* This is unreasonable and takes away any cutting potential. Don't peep where can cut. Cutting now would be dangerous though.]
;B[nq]C[* Black is connected and can blissfully attack now.]
;W[pn];B[on]
(;W[pm]
(;B[jq];W[gf]C[* This again helps black.];B[he];W[jo]C[After reviewing this game myself, i think K 5 shud be at G3. I dont really know the follow up moves.

* The move you played lacks a real aim. There are lots of bigger points on the board. G3 is better but still the cut R4 is still important. Also i would prefer F3 as it secures the corner a bit more.]
;B[qr]C[* Black loses his aji.];W[rq];B[fq]C[* Too far.];W[iq]
C[* Good, punishes it.];B[ir]
(;W[hp]C[* The simple J4 connection move looks better to me.]
;B[hq]C[* This is unreasonable as it creates cutting points.]

(;W[gq]C[* Why not just defend the atari in sente? Would be far better!]
;B[ip]C[* This is terrible for you, cutting points everywhere while black got a ponnuki.]
;W[hr];B[iq];W[gp];B[io]C[* Again black profits from this exchange.]
;W[hm];B[cn]C[* This is the striking point.];W[co]
(;B[dn]C[* Heavy. I can't say which of the variations is best but all seem to have quite a better chance for sabaki than this one.]
;W[cl];B[cq];W[bo];B[ep];W[dq];B[eo];W[fr];B[el];W[fm];B[em]
;W[fn];B[do]
(;W[gj]C[Ok, this was totally greedy and bad-reading

* If you had protected this cut  you surely would have had profited.]
;B[cp]
(;W[cr]C[* Why sacrifice both sides?];B[dr];W[bq];B[eq];W[ar]
;B[bp];W[bn]C[* Tenuki is better.];B[bm];W[lo]C[* The next white moves are overplays. Of course you must do something when you're behind, but not this way. You need territory not weak groups.]
;B[mr];W[lr];B[lq];W[kq];B[mp];W[lp];B[kr];W[mq];B[ls]
(;W[lq];B[in];W[kl]C[* You have just created a group without eyes and purpose in gote and meanwhile solidified black.]

(;B[bs]C[* There are quite bigger moves on the board.]
(;W[lc]C[* Please compare the variations. A normal approach is better than an invasion.]

(;B[jc]C[* Wrong direction. One should approach from the weak side.]
;W[qg];B[nc]
(;W[qc]C[* This is not working so well as again your stones get cur apart.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[ob];B[oc];W[nb]
(;B[rg]C[* I would prefer the other side, see variation.]
(;W[qi]C[* Giving black a ponnuki again is not so well. In this case the sacrifice is not appropriate. 
Avoid to create such ataris if you don't have a very good plan what to do when black captures!]
;B[qh];W[ph];B[pg];W[oh];B[ri];W[qj];B[rj]
(;W[rk]C[* This is too instable.];B[qk];W[rl];B[pk];W[oj];B[ok]

(;W[nl]C[* Black says: Thanks, if you ask me to cut, I'll do so.]
;B[nk]C[* Like J5, such a cut is very powerful and severe,]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[lk];B[mi];W[ng]
(;B[lj]C[* Wrong, see variation.];W[nj];B[kk];W[ll];B[mj];W[lg]

(;B[jk]C[* Heavy.];W[ki]C[* Exploits the weakness];B[kj];W[jl]
;B[kh];W[lh];B[ji];W[li];B[jg];W[if]C[* Wrong side again. The weak stones on the right have to do something , this way they get even weaker.]
;B[jf];W[ie];B[ke];W[le];B[kd];W[ld];B[ic]
(;W[je];B[kf];W[kg];B[jh];W[ij];B[jj];W[lf]C[* Did you notice what black could do since quite a while in this game? If he did it now the corner died.]

(;B[hd]C[* A totally wasted move.];W[bl]C[* Small and not urgent.]
;B[an];W[rr];B[pr]C[I figured i can kill right after b Q2....

* Correct.  Black probably didn't read here.  The move is K1. 
However, black could still cause a little trouble with N18.]
;W[is];B[js];W[hs];B[hf]
(;W[hg]C[* You have a wall with deflects around a dead black group. Defending it is best since your lead is huge then.  
Even if black had cut at N18 you would have still been very much ahead.]
;B[ig]C[I guess b didn't see it (as he admited at the end...) and i was confident b couldn't make 2 eyes...so..]
;W[hh]C[* Considering you didn't see N18, B17 is huge also as protects both cuts.]
;B[ns];W[qs];B[ps];W[or];B[im]C[Right around here i wasn't thinking right. I guess it all started from here.]

(;W[hl]C[* This is bad indeed.];B[il];W[ik];B[hk];W[hj];B[gn]
;W[hn];B[dk]LB[om:A]C[* PEANUTS! A is urgent like a fire in a rocket factory.]

(;W[ej];B[ck];W[cj];B[bk];W[bj];B[aj];W[ai];B[ak];W[bh];B[de]
;W[df];B[kn]LB[om:A]C[Ok, the hunter becomes the hunted >< I was about to cry (and scream). The rest is as you see.

* As I said, think about the rocket factory. 
You could have avoided all this if you had not reacted on the small endgame moves at the left side. Now you can't do anything but defend at A.]
;W[ko];B[ln];W[mn];B[km];W[mo];B[om];W[jm];B[jn]C[* There is nothing white can do to win here.]

(;W[ho];B[mm];W[nm];B[nn]C[
* This was an interesting and tenseful game with a lot of chances and turns. 
I don't agree that it started fine for you, in fact you were behind but black didn't use the aji and made some fighting mistakes.
All in all you did well in killing the bottom black group but you should have strenghtened the wall around it more. And think about the N18 cutting potential which is still there at the end. 

Conclusion: You should take more care about the fundamentals. 
- Protect against cuts just by connecting or at least trying to connect! (J6, C2, O9, J8)
- Attack from the weak side against the strong one! (G10, J14)
- Avoid to create ponnuki-giving-ataris if you don't have a very good plan what to do when black captures! (R13, J3)
- Don't dare invasions/ reductions where normal moves are bigger!  (N5, K5, M17)
- Don't play attach moves when your opponent easily gets ahead in the struggle! (F14, P4, G14)
- If you kill a big group, nothing is more urgent than defending deflects in the surrounding wall.

I suggest you to read  "Lessons in the Fundamentals" by Kageyama and/ or "Attack and Defense" by Ishida.

My best regards,
Thomas])
