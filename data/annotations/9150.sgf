C[Hello,

My names Neil and I will be reviewing your game.
I will review for both black and white.

I think your opening was reasonable, mybe try to make your stones work together, so they harmonise on the whole board.

what lost you the game was the invasion at the top left corner, you should have reduced/enlarged your territory as you were safely winning.

Also what lost you the game was the slow gote moves near the end, always try to look for sente moves before you play the largest gote move.

i hope my review helped a little.

if you like to play me i am 'hiphop' on DGS, offer me a 13x13 game if you wish.

all the best,
Neil];B[jc];W[dk];B[di]C[[NM\] This is an aggressive move, it's OK though.]
;W[cd]
(;B[kj]C[[NM\] Good move, or perhaps]
(;W[jk]C[[NM\] not the best move. because it's too low here.

this is a 13x13 game so important to control centre of the board in my opinion.]

(;B[kk]C[[NM\] This is OK, but better is K4]
(;W[gk]C[[NM\] another low move,];B[ck]C[[NM\] good, it makes white stones look low and bad]
;W[cj];B[dj]
(;W[ek];B[cl];W[gd]MA[fc]C[[NM\] whites moves are loose and so not strongly connected. I think this move is OK, but F11 better here.]

(;B[cg]C[[NM\] an OK move, a little slow, 
I prefer to take a larger point]
(;W[kd]C[[NM\] interesting move, i think L9 would be better though]
;B[kc];W[jd]C[[NM\] I like blacks position on the whole board, 
black has territory in lower left corner and lower right,

Black can attack whites stones at the bottom.

and the centre is open for both black and white so there is no need to play in the centre. Better to make more territory in the corner/side at the moment.]

(;B[id]MA[gd]C[[NM\] i guess you want to attack G10.

there is no need to attack here.];W[kh];B[ld];W[le];B[lc];W[kf]

(;B[ed]C[[NM\] it's difficult to know what's happening on the board now, it's chaotic. 

since black is in the lead, i would play simple such as M5 or k2]
;W[ec]C[[NM\] good move];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd]C[[NM\] white keeps sente, good]

(;W[jj]C[[NM\] it looks like a good move but there is no territory in the centre yet,]

(;B[jl];W[il];B[kl];W[ki];B[li];W[lh];B[mj];W[gh]
(;B[gf]C[[NM\] not the best move, it's a small move.];W[hg]

(;B[bb]C[[NM\] i dont think you can kill white, and white will kill black]
;W[bc];B[cb];W[fb];B[gb];W[fa];B[ga];W[db];B[da];W[eb];B[dd]
;W[cc];B[hd]C[[NM\] black lost sente, so overall this was a really bad invasion that lost many points, mybe 15 points or more.]
;W[bf]C[[NM\] white gets the big point, good move];B[ce];W[be]
;B[cf];W[bg];B[bh];W[ag]
(;B[fg]C[[NM\] this move is worth mybe 5 points,]
(;W[fh];B[eh];W[bi];B[bj]
(;W[ci]C[[NM\] bad move by white];B[ch];W[dl];B[fi];W[gi];B[jf]
;W[if];B[je];W[ke];B[ie];W[jg]
(;B[me]C[[NM\] j1 is better because n9 is 2 points in gote.

j1 is 2 points in sente

h8 is bigger sente move too.

also f4 is a huge move worth about 4 points with big followups]
