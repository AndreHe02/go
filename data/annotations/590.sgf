GC[Commented by Per Schächter 1d. Mimer on IGS.]

C[aga: after game I've commented my moves. Since I won, I more intrested in commenting my comments ;-) rather than moves to be sure (or unsure :) ) if I won game, or my opponent lost it.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[df]
(;W[ch]C[aga: I play pincer having LL corner attack variations in mind.

Mimer: This move is also a good move for white.];B[ff];W[fd]
;B[qf]C[Mimer: Black can't play here. Black should play somewhere around d10, c10 or c9 too counter attack white.]
;W[ck]LB[cn:a]C[aga: Since white 4 can't be affected too much with next black move, I play here to constrain black 5 and 7 and keeping "a" in mind.

Mimer: VERY GOOD. This is the reason why black shouldn't have played r14.]
;B[qd]C[aga: White 10 seems bigger.

Mimer: The normal moves for black would be either o17 or o16.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[oc]C[Mimer: playing r15 would be sligthly better.]
;B[pb];W[ob];B[pe];W[od]C[aga: I sacrifice white 12 building wall.]
;B[qb];W[jc]LB[hc:a]C[aga: I badly needed to play here before black; moreover, I somewhat protect weak "a".

Mimer: this is the correct area to play, but l17 would be safer. Black has a good attack point at m17.]
;B[hd];W[ge]C[aga: If I would tried to undercut black 21, after black G15 he could have some thickness facing center. So I hoped to surround black 5 and 7, and lock black 21 at upper side with minimum points.

Mimer: Good move. Black is weak in this area.];B[gd];W[he];B[jd]
C[Mimer: overplay by black];W[id]C[Mimer: good];B[ic];W[ie]
;B[fc];W[ed]C[Mimer: e17 is stronger.];B[gc];W[kd]C[aga: Shicho is working for me.

Mimer: Yep.];B[db];W[be];B[bf];W[cf]C[Mimer: this is an overplay. c15 followed by connection at f15 is better.]
;B[ce];W[cg];B[bd];W[de];B[cd];W[ef]LB[fe:a]C[aga: Protecting against later possible cut at "a".

Mimer: It is correct to protect the cut but, if you want to protect the cut why not play f15 ?]
;B[jp]C[aga: San-ren-sei. This is what I was afraid of. :-( This game is going to be hard for me.]
;W[cn]C[aga: Attack immediately.];B[dn]C[aga: Correct approach direction; but I'll try not to go into corner, black wall at d3-d6 will be too profitable for black.

Mimer: Yes this seems like the correct strategy.];W[dm];B[co]
;W[em]C[aga: Forming moyo at left center.

Mimer: Your moyo would be bigger if you played e7 first. Now black can make a larger territorium at the bottom.]
;B[en];W[bn]LB[cm:a]C[aga: Protecting cut point "a" and making atari for corner to invade.

Mimer: The cut is small playing at f6 is very huge.];B[bo];W[qk]
LB[qh:a][qn:b]C[aga: After black Q9 I almost could resign. Now I have miai "a" and "b" to settle and attack.]
;B[qi]C[Mimer: wrong direction for black. Black should play r7 to enlarge his moyo while attacking white.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[pm]C[aga: Again, I'm not going to corner.];B[on]
;W[lp]C[aga: It seems to be the best time to invade here.

Mimer: this invasion is very risky because your stones on the rigth is very weak. Before invading you should play r5 to protect your stones.]
;B[jq]C[aga: Black should decide is he playing at left or at right.

Mimer: Black should play r5 and white would be in trouble.]
;W[oq]C[aga: Threating to invade corner to settle.];B[pq];W[kq]
C[Mimer: this move is often played by beginners but it doesn't help white. The reason is that it gives black a move at n3.]
;B[op]C[Mimer: Ouch a thank you move. Black helps white to protect his weak spot. White should be very happy.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[kr];W[lr];B[kp];W[lq];B[or];W[nr];B[pr]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[ks];B[qo];W[rn];B[ro];W[om]C[aga: Position is symmetric at lines 5-7; but it will be harder to invade to lower left now because of black 75.

Mimer: White should be careful. A black move at p10 makes miai of attacking whites p7 group or pulling out the r16 stone.]
;B[oj]C[Mimer: Good move.];W[qj];B[rj];W[rk];B[ri];W[pj];B[pi]
;W[ok];B[bg]C[aga: This move made noticable profit for black later.

Mimer: This is small. r15 is the only move on the board.];W[bh]
C[aga: Securing territory.];B[dg]C[aga: I'm strong enough here, so handling black here don't seems very difficult.]
;W[fg];B[dh];W[di];B[ii]LB[fe:a]C[aga: Neutral zone. But shicho from 7 threatening cutting at "a"  will fail now]
;W[gh];B[gj]C[aga: Limiting my moyo expansion.];W[hq]C[aga: I should neutralize san-ren-sei, or black will have too much. This atari seems to be good to be played right now to invade.]
;B[iq]C[aga: Too passive. H2 would be stronger.

Mimer: Black j3 is best. Black shouldn't leave a cutting point behind.]
;W[eq]C[aga: Threatening to settle at corner.];B[hp];W[hr]LB[is:a]
C[aga: Threatening to connect at J1, and making some form in sente.

Mimer: Black j3 threathens to kill your lower right group in ko.]
;B[hs];W[dq];B[gq]C[aga: I was ready to sacrifice white 98 to have live group nearby, effectively decreasing black's moyo.

Mimer: Good.];W[fq];B[gp];W[bq]C[aga: Corner is big.];B[gr]
;W[fr];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[ar];B[cp];W[fn]C[
aga: Now I supposed my group is live, so I trying to flatten black threatening to cut.]
;B[fp];W[eo];B[ep]C[aga: Now LL white group is in trouble (see variation), but neither I nor my opponent saw this.]

(;W[do];B[oi];W[nn]C[aga: Cutting and connecting.

Mimer: Trying to connect is good, but since black is alive there is now reason to cut him off from the center.]
;B[kn];W[hn]C[aga: Black is going to build moyo here.];B[nk]
C[aga: Too aggressive?

Mimer: No. White is very weak in this area.];W[nl];B[mk];W[im]
;B[jl];W[il];B[jk];W[ln]C[aga: Reviewing a game I'd say it's too slow. During game I saw this stone as cut threat.

Mimer: Correct this is to slow.];B[lm]C[Mimer: there is no need for black to answer.]
;W[mm];B[ll];W[ko];B[jo];W[lo];B[jm];W[kf]C[aga: Black 25 could escape for a long time yet!

Mimer: Yes it has been the biggest move on the board for a very long time.]
;B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[ib];B[hc];W[lb]LB[lh:a]C[aga: Well, my wall white 14-18 didn't make large territory, but after my invasions to buttom game seems to be even. But black would looks better after move around "a".]
;B[ia];W[mc];B[ei];W[fi]C[Mimer: Dangerous. Black could play d11 now.]
;B[fj];W[ej];B[dj];W[eh];B[ek];W[cj];B[ei];W[ci];B[oe];W[ne]
;B[nf];W[mf];B[me]C[aga: Too greedy.

Mimer: This move is OK. It makes n13 sente.];W[nd];B[mg];W[lf]
;B[lg];W[kg];B[lh];W[kh];B[li];W[hj]C[aga: With white 168, 170 it's seems to be simpler to cut here.]
;B[hi];W[ij];B[ji];W[gi];B[hg];W[hh];B[ih];W[ig];B[gg]C[aga: Opps! Misreading. Cut is still possible, but smaller.]
;W[ej];B[ik];W[ei]LB[dk:a]C[aga: It was simpler to play "a".]
;B[hk];W[fk];B[gk];W[fl];B[gl];W[ki];B[hm];W[jh];B[jj];W[gm]
;B[in];W[rc]C[aga: With lot ataris for possible ko fight.];B[rb]
;W[io];B[hl];W[ho];B[kj];W[eb]C[aga: I saw this invasion point at last!

Mimer: The invasion dosn't work. See variation.]
(;B[dc];W[ec];B[fb];W[cc];B[ea];W[da]C[aga: During the game I spend several minutes for finding this move. This is the only move to cut or live at corner at least on ko, otherwise white group will have two miai at A18 and B19. This moves allows me play B19 in sente a bit later. Nice, isn't it?

Mimer: very good move.];B[ca];W[cb];B[da];W[bc];B[ae];W[ba]
;B[fa];W[ab];B[fe]C[Mimer: Black is wasting a ko threath];W[eg]
;B[ag];W[ac]C[aga: I counted that I'm now somewhat ahead, so I decided to not play risky mutual ko - my LL group seems to have too many threats.

Mimer: Correct black should have started the ko with a move at a17.]
;B[ad];W[hb]C[aga: Just hopes in opponent's mistake after long match. ;-)]
;B[ha];W[so];B[sp];W[sn];B[rq];W[bs]C[aga: Big move, costs about 10 points (see variant after move 119), but simple D2 could be better.]
;B[gb];W[ao];B[ip]C[aga: Wasted move.];W[bp];B[fo];W[gn];B[je]
C[aga: I've already read, here are no successful invasions.]
;W[jf];B[go]C[aga: Again wasted move.];W[ka];B[ja];W[pa]C[aga: Playing S16 first would took away one more point from black.]
;B[rd];W[la];B[qa];W[oa];B[no];W[mo];B[fs]C[aga: Oops. I didn't noticed this stone as important earlier. Now I'll have 4 point less.]
;W[dr];B[es];W[ds];B[ns]C[aga: Pure gota. T9, A12 were sente for black.]
;W[ms];B[os];W[sj];B[si];W[sk];B[ah];W[ai];B[is];W[js];B[gf]
C[aga: Obviously, in hope I'd play at H14 ;-) Anyway, it'd be a good trap for me half of year ago. ;-)]
;W[if];B[tt];W[ml];B[tt];W[er];B[gs];W[tt];B[tt]C[aga: Batlle at center was hard and interesting, but I think game was decided by three my invasions into black sides.

Mimer: Yes, but in future games you could gain a lot in strength by playing the urgent moves before the big moves. (making sure all your groups are alive). A stronger opponent would have killed several of your groups in this game.

Seeing at your overall play you have a good knowledge af some of the important strategic concepts like miai and so on. You also have a good fighting spirit playing very few slow moves. Soo playing a lot of games and practicing life and death problems you should have no problem with becoming a stronger player.]

(;W[fd]C[aga: If I was play here...

Mimer: This is a normal white move. You have given several variations to prove it is bad move. I have commented each of them. Trying to explian why whites move isn't bad.]
;B[ci]

;W[cq]C[Mimer: White takes the corner.];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp]
;B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[fq]C[Mimer: This is the normal continuation. It seems like black has got a big territorium on the left, but actualy it isn't that big. White has several options for reducing blacks left area. For example c14, f4 and somewhere around e10.     My estimate would be that white leads with a few points in this position.]
)
(;W[fp];B[dm]C[aga: ... and black again have much influence at left side, and white is far behind.

Mimer: It is correct that black has much influence at the left, but it is also the only place black has influence. This means that white can make just as many points elsewhere on the board. You shouldn't be to concerned about giving your opponent territorium as long as you make just as much or more.]
)
