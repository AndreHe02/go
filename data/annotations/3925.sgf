White has around 43 points of quasi secured territory
Black has around 40

So territory is balanced.

Weak Groups : White has 2 weak groups. Not all Black groups are completly secured, but none is weak as white's one.

So Black's  strategy is to attack the weak White groups so to secure territory or to gain influence.

A and B are such points Black can play
