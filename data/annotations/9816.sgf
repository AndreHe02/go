AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[buckyyowza: Review by Mark Fyffe.  I hope you enjoy reading through my comments and find them to be of use in improving your game!


Review request submitted by Benjamin (Black)

To the reviewer, thanks in advance.];W[qn];B[qj];W[on];B[np]

(;B[pj]LB[oi:A][ok:B]SQ[pf][pi]C[buckyyowza: white's shoulder hit is sente, but be careful how you respond.  In general a touching play is used to attack, but black's stones have no base with which to stage an attack.  With this play, black is helping white to make shape for the Q14/Q11 group.  White should respond now with P11, leaving black's R10 stones little room to survive.

For black, I prefer P9 knight's jump - this more effectively builds thickness and split's white's unsettled groups.]

(;W[ni]
(;B[oj]LB[nk:A]C[buckyyowza: again, the knight's jump at n9 is better. see var - this illustrates why w should have played p11 instead of o11]
;W[oi];B[mj]C[buckyyowza: careful, w can cut at o10];W[cf];B[fc]

;W[go];B[kn]LB[jd:B][dj:A][nj:C]C[buckyyowza: actually, w is gaining thickness very rapidly  - you are correct, however, that w is 5 stones stronger so probably doesn't need to worry about settling his stones ;).  black pressure now will encourage a fight you may be unprepared for.  I prefer a big point still for b: D10 and K16 are very large and will give w a tough game even if all of the white stones currently on the board live as placed.

note that O10 is a significant cutting point, and that the areas around both star points (D10/K16) are big for both players.


At this point, I have a good feeling about the game, since every single white group is weak and can be attacked from my strong positions. I have no such weak stones on the board. I should be advantaged in future fights, right ? But he is 5 stones stonger than me so nothing will happen like planned :)]
;W[rq]
(;B[nm]C[buckyyowza: S2 is too big to ignore - it is joseki for b now, and double-sente for w if ignored.]

(;W[nn];B[dr]C[This tenuki is certainly wrong. I should have kept with the attack on the right group. Since now, I am in byo-yomi and he has 20 mins (he played really, REALLY fast)]
;W[in];B[hn]LB[em:A][fm:B]C[Tryong to isolate his bottom group

buckyyowza: if isolation is your goal, it is better to work from the other side, and remove eye space while maintaining the stability of your own stones.  Consider E7 or F7 instead]
;W[ho];B[io];W[ip];B[jo];W[iq];B[hr];W[ir];B[gs];W[hm]C[At this point, I am quite satisfied]
;B[dj]C[This stone serves as a ladder breaker];W[co]C[This move surprised me

buckyyowza: this move is a probe.  White is asking you to make a choice between the side and corner.  D10 is bigger than a ladder breaker, so w needs to determine your strategy now.  If you choose the corner, then w will build in the side - if you choose to give up the corner, then w is satisfied :)]
;B[do];W[bo];B[bq];W[dn];B[cm];W[dq]LB[er:A]SQ[bo][co][ip][iq]
[ir]C[And I saw the problem, but did'nt manage to find a move that would save all my stones

buckyyowza: correct, you chose to give up the corner.  w saves either the J3 group or the C5 group with this play. Either way, his thickness now has a base from which to launch a larger scale attack on the center and whichever group is not saved yet becomes good aji.

For black now, I prefer E2 instead of the path taken in the game]

;B[ck];W[oq]LB[rr:A]C[buckyyowza: now we see why black should have played S2 earlier :)]
;B[op];W[qr];B[pr];W[pq];B[or];W[qp];B[nq];W[is];B[bd];W[ch]
LB[jd:A]C[buckyyowza: I must point out that K16 has been the biggest point on the board for quite some time.  Always take big gote over small sente in the early-middle game - either player can exploit the large area on top of the board at any time.]

;W[gb];B[og];W[nj]C[I wasn't careful enough here. I costs me the game

buckyyowza: O10 has been a very big cutting point for w since early in the game.  This sequence is diffiult at best for b now - for example consider the variation.  Also, note that this brings the game closer but 5 stones is a lot to overcome; black is still holding the lead.]

buckyyowza: agreed here. w should have been more careful, though still had some potential to live even without F10.]
;W[fj];B[fk];W[gk];B[gj];W[gi];B[hj];W[ek];B[fl];W[el]C[buckyyowza: I am not sure w is thinking this line of play through.  Very smart play on black's part to exploit his mistakes in this area!]

(;B[gh]C[Reading mistake.

buckyyowza:  right, keep it simple and white will die.  There is nowhere for w to run in this area, so no need to cut so close. J10 is best instead]

buckyyowza: I don't see anything for black here except good aji.  w can simply P9 to shut down any b invasion in this area. At this point we are in endgame, so every small point matters.  B can easily win this by keeping sente and playing conservative from here on - I count black is ahead now, but only 5 or 6 points.]
;B[jp]C[buckyyowza: this play is not sente yet. w has 1 more liberty so can ignore this and take sente now.]

;W[pn];B[qo];W[ro];B[gn]C[buckyyowza: a mistake, should be F6 to keep sente and not lose points.]

C[buckyyowza: w can take right away, leaving b 1/2 point behind in a 1 point ko.  H11, C11, and T14 are all big plays still for black - also M14 and B19 are not bad choices.]

(;B[ob]C[buckyyowza: T17 is safe.  It is gote, but b has one eye against no eyes so should win the race here. P18 gives up too much, enough to lose the game in fact.]

[mq][ar][br][cr][lr][mr][nr][as][bs][ks][ls][ms][ns][os]C[buckyyowza: Thanks for the opportunity to review this game!  Playing against an opponent 5 stones stronger can be a very tough - it can be difficult to know what is coming next!  For surviving to play a close end game you can congratulate yourself on a job well done.  B didn't truly lose this game until #246, playing P18 instead of T17

In all black makes very few if any big mistakes in this game, but it is not always the big things that cause you to lose ;)  I hope I have shed some light through my comments to help you see the smaller areas where white took advantage of your small mistakes to ultimately manage a 2.5 point win.
