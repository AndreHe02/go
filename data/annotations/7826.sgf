C[Hi there.

As usuall, I'm having loosing strike :) And as usuall I need some advices to move on and improve.

In this game, which I lost, was very messy fuseki, then one big fight. Both, I think, I lost. I though the game is close, so I want to make my best in yose, but it was already loose game...

Chris: Hi Tomas, let me see what I can do for you.

Chris: Now after looking through the game, here are my general comments:

1) Work on shape!
2) Attack only when youre strong. I believe you dont do this on purpose ;) It has something to do with reading abilities regarding shape (hence connected to point 1). When you want to attack the left, attack the right first to become stronger.
3) Tesuji!

If you have money, I would recommend a good Tsumego and a good Tesuji book. 501 Tesuji problems is often quite difficult, but also very rewarding. I would not spend too much time on goproblems.com, as the problems there are most often taken out of games (and very interesting) but not very instructive in a general way. 

As for life and death, I would recommend Cho Chikuns ABC of life and death and the Korean Baduk Academy problems (I believe the latter is on gobase.org).

As for shape, some pros are notorious for their love of shape ^^ Otake Hideo comes to mind. Also Lee Changho in his earlier years, shows good examples. It is enjoyable, at least for me, to have a quick look over their games (try go4go.net/v2 for an extensive collection).

If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me.

Chris];B[qc];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[bf]C[My oponent said, this one was his mistake as he though my stone is on hoshi.

Chris: True, this is a bad move. Ill show you a few variations you could choose from. It is very hard to say what *exactly* the best move is, especially considering how empty the board is.]

;B[ci];W[nd]LB[de:A][di:B]C[I want to use my "wall"

Chris: There are weak spot like A for example, Black can use to invade. Remember Black doesnt have to worry about the stone in the top right for a *long* time, so he can invade freely. Also the turn at B is probably worth a lot more, than you think. When you build a wall you must come out ahead (faster than your opponent), because turns like B are too big to ignore.]
(;B[pe];W[kd]C[Maybe this stone is too far from my imaginary "wall" ?

Chris: No this is good play locally.Black just helped you. When he invades the top later, you should be able to make profit elsewhere very easily.]

;W[gg]LB[ci:A][fd:B]C[My oponent gets both, corner and center, so somewhere I made mistake

Chris: Yes. Pushing Black ahead at A, while building a wall with bad shape was the problem. Second mistake was not attacking Blacks corner hard enough. You cut off a weak group at B but in return became weak in the center as well. Fight when youre strong, defend when youre not.

The main problem was still though the response to the strange low move in the beginning. Dont help your opponent by attaching!

So far this was a very interesting game to look at ^^];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[gq]C[I want to try something different, mainly get thickness in direction of lower right

Chris: Possible and can be very complicated. I like this variation a lot too.]
;B[gp];W[hq];B[hp];W[fr];B[eq];W[jq];B[ip];W[kr]C[Chris: Correct]
;B[cq];W[cp]LB[er:A][cp:B][ck:C]C[Chris: Black could have played A, putting White into a bit of a dilemma. Protect the left and leave bad aji on the bottom? I would prefer B at C in this case]
;B[bq];W[ck]C[Chris:];B[pj]SQ[fd][gd][hd][id][ie][if][ig][hg]
LB[bb:A][rd:B][jb:C][ir:D][cm:E][cr:F][qn:G]C[Now I had to invade.

Or it's better to attack black's central group first ?

Chris: We have to look at the board.

Black has 15 points at A, 12 points at B, 6 points at F.
White has 4 points at E, 10 points at C and 6 points at D.

So I count B 33 - W 20+Komi. So the score is less than 10 points difference, that is ok in early midgame. The problem is, where is Whites potential? I dont see any, but the entire right side is potential for Black. 

Hence we need to find a working gameplan now! The marked group does not have any eyes whatsoever. But we cannot attack it immediatedly. Since D is very strong, a splitting invasion at G is a good idea. We have to play steady and wait for our opponent to make a mistake we can exploit (and hopefully attack the marked stones in the process)]
(;W[qn]C[Chris: Good!];B[qo];W[pn]C[Chris: Strange exchange by Black. This influence, or what will become of it, will help White!]
;B[nq]
(;W[qj]LB[qg:A][ig:B]C[Chris: I understand your desire to live fast, but in this case 2 other things happen as well. Black gets much stronger in the process, so an invasion at A becomes more and more difficult and the extra influence will help Black settle the B group.]

(;W[lf];B[mg];W[lg];B[mh];W[kh];B[ij]C[Chris: Since Black has a few more liberties now, the 4 stones have a little less aji. Lets see what White can make of the attack in the center.]
;W[kj];B[di]C[Now again, my oponent gets both, his central group is alive and my four stone are almost captured

Chris: I am afraid youre right.]
(;W[gj]C[Chris: Since you are weakish you cannot attack like this! Black has too many forcing moves to settle! Attack when youre strong, not weak.]
