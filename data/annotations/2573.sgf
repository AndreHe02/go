RE[W+13.50]

C[This is a game I recently played on KGS. I added some of my thoughts to it.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[ec];B[jc];W[df];B[jp];W[qm];B[np];W[qj]
;B[dk];W[dm];B[dh];W[mc];B[pf];W[qg];B[qf];W[mf];B[gc];W[gq]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er]C[I think B4 is better because W is weaker on that side]
;W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[ar];W[fr];B[es];W[fs];B[dr];W[cs];B[cc]
C[matze: I misread this, thought the bottom left group was dead.]
;W[cd]C[apparently, W missed it as well. I'm glad you caught it.]
;B[bs];W[dc];B[cb];W[db];B[bd];W[be];B[ce];W[dd];B[bf];W[cf]
;B[ae];W[de];B[be];W[gf];B[jf];W[jr];B[iq]C[matze: Perhaps better at L3 or M2?
This isn't badd as a way to force W down, although the sacrifice at J2 could help you make a nice wall to the right.]
;W[ir];B[hr]C[matze: Bad move I think, w can easily cut. H4 instead?
This was a bad move; the other side is more important. Probably M3 is the best shape here, since it is too late to do L2.]
;W[hq];B[kr]C[matze: Again better L3 or M2?
M3, I think];W[jq];B[ip];W[kq];B[lq]C[matze: M4 better?];W[lr]
;B[mr];W[ks];B[mp]C[shouild be M4];W[lp];B[mq];W[kp];B[lo];W[ko]
;B[ho];W[gh];B[gk];W[jh];B[kg];W[ln];B[mo];W[kh];B[lg];W[og]
;B[mh];W[mg];B[lh];W[ke];B[je];W[hd];B[hc];W[fb];B[kd];W[le]
;B[ld];W[md];B[lb];W[mb];B[ni];W[nh];B[oh]C[matze: Connecting at N11 better?]
;W[ng];B[oi];W[pg];B[nl];W[nn];B[kl];W[lm];B[ll];W[nm];B[ml]
;W[lj];B[ki];W[ji];B[kj];W[jj];B[jk];W[bk];B[bi]C[matze: Should I have tried to attack B9? Starting with C8 or something?
C8 would be a nice aggressive move.];W[pe];B[oe]C[I would go underneath at R15 here]
;W[qe];B[pd]C[matze: Connecting at P14 better?];W[of];B[rf]
;W[re];B[ob]C[matze: I also thought of S17
Make use of your dead stones by playing at S16, I think];W[qb]
;B[qc]C[ugly. Better is S18, S17 or S16];W[rd];B[rc];W[od];B[oc]
;W[nd];B[na];W[ma];B[nb];W[rb]C[matze: Would w Q19 have killed the group?
No,  I don't think so: you could respond with S19; you have the outside liberties you need.]
;B[sc];W[sd];B[pa];W[sb];B[qa];W[op];B[oq]C[matze: P5 better?
not sure];W[qq];B[pq];W[rp];B[rq];W[qo];B[qr];W[ro];B[po];W[pn]
;B[oo]C[you were already alive; I think there are more important points. R9 looks like a key point to me]
;W[ol];B[ok];W[pl];B[pk];W[qk];B[fm]C[I would attack at C8 first]
;W[lc];B[kb];W[kc];B[jd];W[hi];B[eg];W[ef];B[fg];W[gg];B[ff]
;W[fe];B[gd];W[ge];B[he];W[gb];B[hb];W[fd];B[fi];W[hk];B[hl]
;W[ik];B[il];W[jm];B[km]C[matze: Better J7 or J6?
I like F4 as a forcing move. K6 is also good move here. Often your opponent's best move is your best move.

Also, C8 is still big, and you might be able to make something from E4.]
;W[jn];B[kn]C[matze: More important to connect at H4, I completely failed to notice that the J4 group is in danger]
;W[jo];B[im];W[hn];B[gn];W[io];B[in];W[go];B[hm];W[hp];B[fo]
;W[el];B[ek];W[ep];B[hn]C[This is too small. Invade on the left.]
;W[bl];B[gp];W[fp];B[go];W[fl];B[gl];W[fk];B[gj]C[matze: F10 instead? This move was because I wanted to connect to F11. I first didn't notice that the group can also live with E6 or connect at K8.
Yes, F10 is better];W[fj];B[gi];W[fh];B[eh];W[ej];B[dj];W[ei]
;B[di];W[cl];B[dl];W[em];B[en];W[dn];B[eo];W[jl];B[kk];W[ph]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[hj];W[ij];B[hh];W[ig]C[matze: Any chance now to kill the K12 group?

Not that I can see.];B[ih]C[matze: H13 better?

No, it sets up a double atari after H14. H14 is better, but you could play at P6 or D19 or C13 to more advantage.]

Don't let your opponent lead you around. Have fun.])
