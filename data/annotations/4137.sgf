AB[pd][dp]C[Agilis: Hi, thanks for any help you can offer in this review. Alot of fighting occured and even though I managed to win, I know I could've done better if I weren't sloppy about things. So what I'm most interested in is are the mistakes that white made in defending, and help seeing where fights are 'over' enough for tenuki to be a good option.

> Hello, I am Geza Bohus 7k EGF. I will precede my notes with  > so you can find them easily.

Some general comments here:

As you yourself suspected you both fought over a couple of points many times when there were still huge areas open. I realize that it is hard to judge the value of a stone in the middle of nowhere, but believe me, it's big 8-).

In the beginning you were too worried about no letting black get territory on the right. Perhaps a better strategy is to calmly build your own moyo and invade later. Black's playing so high would probably have that made possible. (Or else he would have added lower stones in which case the whole strategy becomes inefficient.)

Starting with move 210 you both failed to notice that a white group was in mortal danger in the lower left. If you had lost that, you would have lost the game. Luckily for you, black did not know -- and did not occur to him -- the simple eye-stealing move at A3. 

I included some "might have been" variations without comment. You might want to take a look at those.

Please let me know if you have any questions. You can email me at gbohus@yahoo.com.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[jq];B[ol]C[Black played many moves I found strange, such as this one. They didn't interfere with my plans too much so I managed, but  I wonder if there's any method to this madness.

> Yes, this is strange, but there is no need to worry. Making territory is easiest in the corners, then sides, so going towards the center so fast doesn't make much sense. Remember, the goal is to make territory!]
