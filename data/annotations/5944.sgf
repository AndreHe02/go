C[In general, I'm looking for review of my opening, and then the early  middle-game.  Thank you!]
;B[pc];W[qp];B[cd];W[dp];B[qe];W[nq]C[[Good beginning from both sides\]]
;B[oq];W[op];B[pq];W[qq];B[pp];W[po]C[white seems to have played this all wrong
[Good position for W\]];B[oo];W[np];B[qo];W[pn]C[[B's ataris are no threat\]]
;B[qn];W[pr]C[[W is now well off\]];B[ec];W[cj]LB[jd:B][jp:A]
C[[B's opening is slow. W is covering more ground. Playing at A instead would be better still because it uses the influence of the wall to the right and may possibly connect with left corner to outline much area. In general, if you happen to form a wall, play out from it; if the opponent happens to form a wall, you can play near (but not too close to) it to make it ineffective, but only if it is still a good move for you with supporting stones nearby.

A potential move for B now would be to play just a little left of 'A' so as not to be close to the influence of the wall and still eliminate the opportunity for W to mark out the bottom edge. A better move for B though is to make use of its own 'walls' and play at or near 'B' which works with the stones on the right to mark out area and may later also work with the stones on the left.\]]
;B[jd]C[black looks incredibly strong on top now - how could white have prevented?  should 20 be at 21?  something earlier for white?]
;W[df]LB[cm:B][jp:A]TR[cj][dp]C[how to approach the top?
[This is a good approach to the top. It is however not the right time. There are bigger places to play as shown. 'A' was already explained. The good thing about playing 'B' is that the area outlined with the marked stones on the left can be extended in either direction. The opponent can only take away one of these possible extensions so leaves room to grow.\]]
;B[fq];W[hq]LB[iq:A][jq:B]C[[A good idea from B to take some the bottom before W gets it all.\]]
;B[fo];W[dr]LB[jq:A]C[[A good move for B now would be at 'A' which splits up the bottom so there is little territory value for W.\]]
;B[qm];W[pm]LB[md:C][qi:B][dn:D][jq:A]C[[Not a great move from B. It is little threat to W and there are still bigger unplayed areas around the board.\]]
;B[gm]C[[Another odd move from B. These stones are not in any immediate danger so there's no reason to run to the centre.\]]
;W[fe]C[[There is unplayed space around the board, play there first. When it is time to play reducing moves, try to play on the forth line (e.g. 16), as a forth line defense is in favour of the defender.\]]
;B[gd]C[[In the last moves by W and B, B made territory, W has not secured any, and territory in the centre takes more moves to make.\]]
;W[ge];B[he];W[fd];B[fc];W[hf];B[ie];W[ih]LB[md:D][ql:C][dm:B]
[kp:A]C[[Play corner territory first--done. Then sides--still available. 'D' doesn't make territory but does prevent B from making a large area.\]]
;B[jg]TR[pc][jd][qe]SQ[df][hf][ih][cj]C[[Be aware of the huge potential territory that B may make with the triangle marked and just played stones. Know that if one carefully choses where battles take place, one may lose every battle and yet have made more territory behind the battle lines as an indirect consequence.

W is also making possible territory, but it is smaller and prone to an open attack from B stones already below.\]]
;W[ig];B[jh];W[ij]LB[fj:A]C[[Still better to make/break territory around sides first. If it was time to make centre territory, first block possible invasions by playing around 'A'.\]]
;B[jq]C[[Excellent move by B. Makes the W wall to the right ineffective, threatens H3 and likely makes some territory.\]]
;W[kq]LB[io:A]C[[This could make some territory with wall on the right. Playing at 'A' helps run out of the trap as well as threatening to trap K3 against the wall to the right.\]]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[jn];W[kn];B[jl];W[dm]C[[Excellent move by W to play it before B takes the opportunity away.\]]
;B[kj]C[[The entire upper right quadrant is looking very much like it could go to B without a fight.\]]
;W[il];B[im];W[hl];B[pk]C[[Excellent move by B now taking the right side.\]]
;W[ll];B[lk];W[mk];B[mj];W[nk];B[nj]C[[Still the upper right quadrant goes uncontested.\]]
;W[kk];B[jk];W[lj];B[li];W[jj];B[lk];W[kl];B[gl];W[ik];B[ql]
;W[ki];B[lj]C[[Most of those fighting moves will make little difference to the final score as they do not mark out large territories.\]]
;W[qi]C[this seems like the wrong place to invade - where is better?  one line higher?  how to live here?
[The question was not where, but when. Should have invaded before there was so much B influence.\]]

;B[ri];W[rh];B[sh];W[sg];B[rk];W[qk];B[qg]C[[Before continuing to expand or attack, think "how will this group live?" How about if W played R13?\]]
;W[qh];B[og];W[ph]C[[Capturing at S13 instead provides a bit more possibility for a second eye space.\]]

;B[bn]LB[el:A]C[[If the single stone at B5 is not saved now, W can still easily defend its territory below. With this move it could play something big like 'A' before B continues attacking.\]]

;W[sn];B[ro];W[rl];B[rm];W[tt];B[tt]C[[In general, W can play the battles well enough. It is important to see the 'big picture' and decide when and where battles are to take place, what the shape of the space on either side of the resulting battle fronts will look like, and whether a small threat should even be defended at all (give a little here take a lot there).

Remember, play for territory in the corners first, sides next. Don't let large the opponent form large territories as a side effect of seemingly unrelated battles.

Good luck and enjoy these new ideas.\]])
