AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi reviewer,

This was a four-stone handicap game.  I played Black.

I thought the game was under control until about move 76.  All comments are welcome!

Especially important is that even though I had the game under control, I felt that I played slowly and a little soft.  Please comment on this.

Thanks,
Kyle

Reviewer:
Hi Kyle,
I review on the black side.];W[qn];B[nq];W[cf];B[fc];W[qi];B[qf]
LB[ce:1][df:2][dj:3]C[[kb\]: My idea was to play calmly until it was obvious I should be attacking something.

R:Principal idea is as follows: In handicap game,  black vs white ratio is maximum in the begining stage i.e.
  four black stones vs one white.
However, thereafter the differences are becoming smaller and smaller, e.g.  after 1oo moves 54black stones and 50 white.
Therefore, if you find a weak stone cluster, black must attack it in early stage.
As star stone (Q-16) is living, black  must attack on white stone (c14) as shown in number order. The position of number 3 stone (I select D10, though a professional player teached me D11-selection).]
;W[dm];B[qk];W[oi];B[qo];W[fq]C[[kb\]: What's the best way to handle this?
R: Black 12 move was right way.];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[eq]LB[do:A]
[dq:B]C[R:This connect (A) is too defensive. 
B move is the best as shown in a next branch.
As this pattern is so often seen, I comment it in detail.]
(;B[do];W[cr];B[gn];W[hp];B[dj]C[[kb\]: I thought this was an OK result for B, although White B4 is annoying.]
;W[mq]C[[kb\]: I didn't know how to respond here so I tenukied.]

(;B[ce]C[R: Now two black stones(5 stones and  are separated]

C[[kb\]: I misread here.  I should have just cut, or left it.

C[[kb\]: What to do?
R:This move is good.];W[bi];B[ck];W[bj];B[di];W[bk];B[cl];W[ch]
;B[dh];W[dg];B[eg];W[be];B[df];W[cg];B[bd];W[ef];B[de];W[bl]
;B[kd]CR[qm]C[[kb\]: At this point I felt the game is still well under Black's control.  Positional judgment says I'm still up by 30+ points or so.  Black's moyo is large!

R:This 60 (L16) is slack. Urgent point is circle point.
If black 6 stones and a stone(R9) connect to each , then two white stones (p11 and R11) must live. 
Large moyo is not definite territory. Living or not is much important.]
;W[qm];B[ok];W[pm];B[mj];W[nm];B[mh]TR[mj][ok][nm][pm][qm]C[[kb\]: This trade seems good for Black.
R: Loss of  6 black stones is great.];W[qg]
(;B[qe]C[[kb\]: I tried to cover the 3-3 here, but now I know the attachment at L17 plus 3-3 is probably very hard to stop.  How should I play here?
R: black 60 move is too weak. black should attack white.
Q14 move may be good.];W[rk];B[lm]C[[kb\]: Maybe a bit of an overplay.
R: 60 move seemed me a good selection];W[eh];B[fg];W[jm];B[jj]
;W[kc]
(;B[jc]CR[lc]C[R:As left side is so narrow, 68 move should be  opposite side (circle).]
;W[lc];B[jb];W[pb]C[[kb\]: Good move.  I can't chase it out.]

(;B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb]
(;B[ld];W[qc]TR[qg][oi][qi][rk][jm][nm][pm][qm][qn]C[[kb\]: Now I asked my opponent during the review what to do here. He suggested the first variation.]

(;B[rl]CR[lo]TR[pn][qo][mp][np][pp][nq]C[[kb\]: At the time I thought that I could run my weak group at the bottom to safety by forcing White to live, but I underestimated the strength of his stones.
R: Now black cannot save all  stones, circle position may be a good  connection.]

;W[rm];B[ri];W[rh];B[si];W[ll]C[[kb\]: Now I am in trouble.

The rest of the game went very badly for Black (and will go no matter what variation is chosen) and is not worth reviewing.

Thanks for your review.
R: If do you had a consideration of weak stones (no living) or strong stones (living), you will do  remarkable  progress.]
