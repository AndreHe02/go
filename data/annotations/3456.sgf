AB[pc][pd]C[This game was almost decided in the opening, by White taking the key point of R14 and then expanding
his surrounding territory. During the rest of the game, Black offered a good fight and won back many points -
but not enough to reverse the score. Both players offered a good endgame. Black, your tactics are good,
but you need to also develop your sense of territory and play some of the bigger moves earlier.
If you have further questions, contact me.

;W[qn];B[np];W[pj];B[jc]TR[qf][qg][qh]C[After W R6 and Q10 with Black above and below, a play near R13 is absolute for both sides. For White, it
widens his territory and reduces Blacks, and settles his group. For Black, it expands his territory
and reduces White's, and weakens White's group. So there are 3 reasons to play there,
everything else on the bord is smaller.];W[fc];B[fp]TR[qh][cj]
C[After White has made a shimari, C10 to reduce its influence is bigger than F4. 
R12, of course, is the biggest move on the board.];W[fq];B[gq]
