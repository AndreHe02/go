C[I'm dbstraight, black. The game was played on KGS.

Hi I am Oleg, I will mark my comments by OM.

Now that I went over this game, I'd like to stress three things: 

  1) Like many beginning players, both you and your opponent pay much attention to endgame-like plays (on second and, especially, first lines). Sometimes these are necessary, but the majority of these plays are "small" that is, there are more attractive things on the board. 

 2) Occasionally I saw you try to "make territory using thickness"; the usual notion is that you should use thickness (i.e. a strong position, like your was on top) for attacking. You would normally try to chase your opponent's group toward your thickness. That is, you will not necessarily make territory there (as you often mention in your comments your goal was) but you will make territory somewhere else.

 3) The overall idea of the "health" of the group. If the group is strong (like yours on the top side was), you might leave it alone; if your group is weak, it needs protecting; if your opponent's group is weak, it's a liability to him, and you can profit handsomely from attacking. The most important example is the cut at F15 that you both neglected for so long. 

Overall, I think, you played better in the beginning, but then you got overly cautious and 
missed some chances for an attack.
If you keep reviewing your games and playing thoughtfully, I think you will progress fairly quickly! 

Good luck, O.M.];B[qd]C[dbstraight [20k\]: hi

C[This continuation by white surprised me.

OM: Kogo's online dictionary says this is not joseki. I will post a few moves, you can look up more in Kogo's]

(;B[qe]C[I figured this extension would secure some side territory. I know the usual follow-up to a contact play is hane, but neither one seemed good to me here.]
;W[pe];B[pf];W[qc]C[I seem to lose the corner, but maintain good control of the side.

OM: this is ok for B I think];B[rc];W[rb]
(;B[sc]C[OM: I would probably prefer the var];W[sb]C[OM: this is surely an overplay by White, now you gain an upper hand]
;B[qb]C[Intending to win either the stones in the corner or the R17 stone.

OM: good!];W[nc]C[OM: this is also bad, W gets a very cramped, heavy shape]
;B[md]C[Again, the hane doesn't seem good. O18 is safe, but seems to allow white to move out toward the center too much.

OM: this is ok. You could also take at R17 and end up with a free corner]
;W[mb]C[White takes the territory I left open.];B[lb];W[nd]
C[Not an expected continuation.

OM: White is in trouble, he also makes bad shape (empty triangle)]
;B[nb]C[Gaining a free stone and enlarging my territory slightly.

OM: you could probably gain even more playing N15, after this White may still live, but give you a lot of influence on upper side]
;W[ob];B[ma];W[pc]C[It seems white still should've been able to save the corner stones.]
;B[ra];W[of]C[With this play, it seems white's group will definitely be able to live, so I'll turn my attention to securing territory.]
;B[pg];W[og];B[ph]C[4th line push is good, right?

OM: I think it is. White gives you free territory];W[pb]C[Forcing the capture.

OM: a move like this is to be avoided, it does not gain anything for W, just spends a possible ko-threat. 
 I'm not even sure you should take it, maybe you can play elsewhere.]
;B[sa]C[And taking it.];W[ne]LB[dj:a][qn:b][fq:c]C[OM: a very defensive move by W. Next move can enlarge the lead for B, say A-C. N15 is not bad, but it's playing close to thickness... (where you are already strong)]
;B[me]C[Keep my position strong on the side.];W[mf];B[lf];W[mg]
C[OM: this is a pushing sequence I see a lot in lower kyu games. However I feel this exchange is better for B]
;B[kf]C[I wasn't sure whether I should continue pushing downward or not. This seemed like a safe play that would allow me to shift my attention elsewhere on the board.

OM: you group on top is super strong! Now is the time to turn to one of these yummy points I've shown earlier. If you'd like to play here, M13 is the spot]
;W[df];B[ce]C[Perhaps given my strong side position along the N line, I shouldn't have let white get in there.

OM: this is not joseki but again, I wouldn't say it's a bad mistake. They say push your opponent towards your strength. But Black F16 is probably better, you would build a large framework.]
;W[fd];B[hd]LB[ee:a][cf:b]C[I considered another diagonal at E17, but it seemed it would give away too much (or all) of my potential side territory. I assumed I would lose corner territory here, but keep the side.

OM: this move is not very good. Like I said on the previous comment, push him towards your strength. This means get strong in the corner. I would play either A or B here.]
;W[de];B[cc]C[Preventing the cut.];W[gc];B[hc]C[Securing the side territory.

OM: this seems a waste however, to let your strong wall in the center only gain you about 20 points or even less]
;W[hb];B[ib];W[ha]C[OM: this move is usually for endgame only, it is small. Also, here it enables a cut (See var)]

(;B[ia]C[OM: this is also an endgame move, W is forced to defend, and you lose some opportunities (like the cut I've shown earlier)]
;W[gb]C[OM: better at F 18];B[ed]C[The idea was to move into a position to cut off white's main group there from the D15 and D14 stones.

OM: not a bad idea!];W[ee]C[And it was blocked.

OM: now B should cut at F15, see var]
(;B[fc]C[I thought this was a safe play, but as it turns out, it wasn't. Again, trying to cut off some white stones for capture and/or enlarge my territory.]
;W[ec]C[The unexpected and dangerous cut. F18 was my first thought, but E18 would block that quickly. I also considered D17, but it seemed I should play more toward securing the corner.

OM: As long as you can push out (C14) there's no danger for you! You tend to play a little greedy - you want the secure territory, right away. Instead, you might want to focus on keeping the opponent weak and attacking him. you can gain a lot while attacking! 
It's not too late for the cut]
(;B[db];W[fb];B[eb]C[With the idea of closing this "eye."

OM: no use, as he connects easily with G15];W[fc]C[OM: Wow, he still lets you cut! F15 is very good for Black.]
;B[fq]C[No further attention seemed necessary at the top, nor did it seem possible to capture any of white's stones. This seemed a good way to continue my attack on the corner, but perhaps C4 would've been better... on the other hand, perhaps playing at the other corner or along the bottom side would've been better too. What choice of tenuki should I have made?

OM: this move is standard, R6 would also be good, but you *shouldn't have tenuki'd at all*!]
;W[dc]C[It seemed to me that from this position, I was wrong about my assumption about the lack of attention needed and that white had a good attack up in the corner, but I can't find it (if it exists).]
;B[cd]C[Protecting my stones.];W[co]C[OM: hmm this is not joseki either... Why?]
;B[dn]C[Perhaps the hane at B5?

OM: this is a good move. if we follow the logical continuation, white will get the corner, but you will get groups on  both sides. A "kick" play at C5 is also the one I often see from lower-rated players. It does gain some corner territory, but it strengthens the opponent.]
;W[eq]
(;B[fp]C[Giving up the corner for influence toward the center.

OM: these are very logical moves (D6 and F4). You might also try C3 right away (Var)]
;W[bo];B[bn]C[OM: this is a little passive. If White stones around D14 were in good shape, the wall you gain is not very valuable. (Of course we now know that D14 stones are very vulnerable.) Maybe you could play F2 first, lock him into the corner]
;W[an];B[am]C[OM: again, hypothetically, if D14 were strong, I would not play here and play on the bottom instead.]
;W[ao];B[bl];W[fr]C[It turns out this development by white leads to problems later.]
;B[gr];W[fs];B[gs]C[OM: there is a potential cut at G3, so I would just play H3 here. Is the ladder favorable? (see var on move 80)]
;W[er];B[eo]C[Stop white from breaking through the middle there.

OM: you do build an impressive wall, but it lacks side extension...]

(;W[mq]C[OM: Yes, this is how W negates a lot of the wall's strength]
;B[jq]C[Could I have played this closer at L3 and still been safe?

O.M.: you are probably too concerned with safety here. The wall is farily strong, with the exception of broken ladder and W's possibel cut at G3. More important question here is: how to make this wall work more efficiently? A move like L4 might be more efficient. Other possibilities are R3 (take away White's corner) and R6 (try to biuld the right side which is still not finished)]
;W[qn]C[OM: W got some profit here];B[ql];W[ep]C[OM: another strange move that makes B safer]
;B[fn]C[OM: but this move should be at G5, protect G3 cut at the same time]
;W[gq]C[The aforementioned problem. With the stone at E4, white killed the potential for a ladder.]

(;B[hq]C[I'm assuming either G1 and G2 or F3 and F4 are dead, so I decide to protect the one with some territory behind it. Though perhaps (see variation)...

OM: I would choose the other one. The territory is not that big, and you would build an amazing influence]

(;W[gp];B[ir]C[I'm afraid of the cut I showed in the other line, but it seems I may not have needed to be. Sacrificing stones to protect this cut.]
;W[fo];B[go];W[fp];B[ho];W[hp]C[Again, white plays a stone to kill a potential ladder after the cut, and again I'll fall for it.]
;B[ip]C[But this seemed necessary to protect my group on the bottom. Was it?]
;W[gn];B[hn]C[Trying to reduce the effect of white's cut.];W[gm]
;B[jn]C[Trying to enlarge my group and gain influence toward the center. I was thinking white might play F7, to attack my group on the left side. It seems this play could definitely been better in regards to extending my group on the bottom, but where?

OM: this seems ok; W cutting stones are weak. I think B should have an upper hand in a fight here]

(;W[kq]C[OM: this is ludicrous - your group is rock solid and W cannot gain anything but playing here. you can easily ignore]

(;B[kr]C[OM: you see, your possible profit here is limited, it is much better towards center]
;W[ko];B[jo]C[OM: again, White can do you no harm here];W[lq]
C[OM: fairly small, F7 was a must];B[fm]C[Preventing white from attacking this group.

OM: more importantly, *you* are the attacker here! Do not be so shy!]
;W[hm];B[im];W[gk];B[gl]C[I thought about F9, but it seemed this would get me the same move for free...]
;W[hl]C[I didn't take into account the fact that I would be in atari.]
;B[fl]C[Protecting my stone. Again, I was expecting white to try to attack and reduce this group, perhaps with F9.]
;W[il]C[OM: W was wise *not* to play F9, he would have been cut. But you can still cut, right?]

(;B[jm]C[K8 instead?
OM: surely K8 is better but H9 is even better!];W[lr]C[OM: it is very strange that W abandoned his stones and played here... Once gain, this is pretty small endgame move. You should punish him!]
;B[ks]C[A normal pattern, but it turns out to be problematic later.]
;W[kp];B[jp]C[OM: both these moves are nearly useless];W[cf]
;B[bf]C[Protect the corner.];W[bg];B[af];W[ag];B[be];W[ea]C[Presumably with the idea of cutting if I replied with D19.]
;B[ca]C[This seemed best.];W[gd]C[OM: It's hard to see you guys making these moves while the cut is still there!]
;B[he]C[Keep white out of my side.];W[do];B[en]C[OM: omg, the cut!!!!]
;W[fk]C[Now the expected white attack comes.];B[ek];W[ck]C[I truly had no idea how I should respond to this play. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.]

(;B[dl]C[Focusing solely on living.

OM: this is your problem in the latter stages of the game. Go is a two-way game, it's hard to win solely by defending. You should recognize your group here as strong (wall, eyeshape near B7 and A8) and the opponent as weak (H8 group, no base, cuttable). So your strategy here is not "OMG I'm gonna be killed", but "how do I exploit his weakness?".  The cut (H9) is still there! (And the other cut, at F15). So you can play H9 right away and press your attack; or you can play solidly E10 and then kill the intruder stone (see var)]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[dk];B[ej]C[Until white closes off my liberties on the top, he can't invade (or perhaps E7?), so it seemed like a good time to run off and reduce his potential territory.]
;W[bk];B[em]TR[el][bm]C[This may have been premature, but securing life for my group.

OM: not really, the triangled eyes are false];W[ci];B[fj]C[There are probably better follow-ups here to attack white.

OM: sure, H9];W[hj];B[gj]C[The idea is to head toward my group at the top after forcing H9.

OM: it's getting tough for B now];W[hk]
(;B[gi]C[OM: I would say your best chance here is to try and connect with H15; probably H11 is most direct, G12 looks promising too]
;W[jl]C[OM: again, W tenukis at the wrong time];B[oi]LB[kl:a]
[ih:b]C[Enlarge my territory, and prevent this white group from influencing the center as strongly.

OM: as do you... A and B are both nice moves];W[qm]C[dbstraight [20k\]: big storms here, if i disappear, it's a power outage... i promise, i wouldn't run]

(;B[rm]C[Protect the side.

OM: S8 is better because it has "monkey jump" followup];W[rn]
;B[sm]C[OM: seriously, stop playing this move! (I've seen it many times already). Just play S8 and then T6 is your sente.]
;W[sn];B[rk]C[OM: this ends up gote for you];W[pl];B[pk];W[ol]
C[Georgi [19k\]: ok];B[ok]C[OM: this is fairly small. The K8 group is still weak, press it]
;W[nh]C[OM: not necessary];B[ni]C[Keep the white group out of the center as much as possible and continue extending my territory, though very slightly so.]
;W[ak];B[da]C[Seeing as my time is running low, I just made a play that I knew maintained sente and was likely to happen at some point anyway.]

;W[ki];B[nl]C[The idea now is just to reduce.];W[pm];B[qq]C[Standard 3-3 invasion to reduce territory. It also seemed like I wouldn't have to run out of time doing it. Does this thing ever fail?

And I'm defeated. There were definitely some interesting fights in there, and it seems like in the end I could've won if I had saved my group, but I'm sure that wasn't my only mistake. Certainly, I need to be more watchful for the plays which prevent me from using the ladder to capture cuts. I would love to know other things I could've done better.

In a lot of my past games, I've focused too much on territory and too little on influence, and ended up winning corners but losing the entire middle and thus losing the game. I didn't want that to happen here, so I occasionally sacrificed to get stones toward the middle of the board. Even though white still took the very middle, it seems that style of playing was good. I would also love general strategic ideas that I can use in choosing how to play out the corners and sides, with an eye toward the full game, not just living and getting territory.]
