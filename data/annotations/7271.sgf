C[H: This was a close game.  I was only 2 points ahead on the board, so if this were an even match, I would not have won.  I'd like critique on my choice of direction and timing for invasion, etc.  My yose was better, though I missed a couple of big endgame points, and that was what won the game for me.  I obviously did not play at a 1k level, which is my goal.

Thank you very much for the review.];B[pd]C[CW [1k\]: hi];W[dc]
;B[qp];W[dq];B[oq]LB[qj:A]C[H: I'm used to the approach at A.]
;W[cj]C[H: This was a confusing move.  In general, my understanding is that W should definitely not want to have a moyo race with B, especially if B gets to have a shimari helping to make solid territory.

CG: This is a handicap game, so white must try something unusual. The wariuchi R10 was considered "the only move" among professionals for a long time, but AFAIK this is no longer the case. Just for reference: I have a single chinese professional game in my game database where white played C10, and white won by resignation (王元, 7p - 张文东, 8p, W+R, Komi 5.5, 中国大国手围棋赛).]
;B[pj]C[H: What feels like the only move, to me.];W[pg]LB[nd:A]
C[H: This was strange as well.  I wasn't too sure if this was meant to be a trick.  In the game I decided to take the corner in a small way, but I think A might have been better.

CG: This is indead a strange move. The professional game continued with O17.]
;B[qe]C[CG: I would prefer O16. When you play R15, the risk is that Q13 finally turns out to be a forcing move, so you have to be careful with the follow-up moves.]
;W[nc];B[nd]C[H: Was this okay?  I thought that this forceful, splitting move was good.

CG: O16 looks ok.];W[md];B[oc]C[CG: This is strange - see your own variation!
O15 looks normal here.]
(;W[mc]C[CG: White should follow your variation.];B[ne];W[ng]
;B[mf];W[nj];B[pl];W[nl];B[on]C[H: Now I'm feeling ahead.  W has some influence, but I can play this.]
;W[mn];B[lg]C[CG: This looks small. I would rather attack black at the top by playing K17. 

M13 itself makes no territory - if you don't have an effective follow up, it is just a wasted move (which would explain why you won with just two points).]
;W[pi];B[qi]LB[qk:A]C[H: Some aji at A, but I was pretty sure it was okay in the game.

CG: The hane is ok.];W[oi];B[ok]C[CG: This is a strange move. I think you want to play a forcing move to get rid of the aji at R10, but this move is aji-keshi (maybe at some time you would rather play N9). if you are worried abot R10, it would be better to play R12 which is also very big.]
;W[lj];B[ke]C[CG: This is not an effective attacking move! You are already alive, so you have to play K17!]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[kb]C[H: Here, I think my only choice was to pull back and let W connect.

CG: So thats the reason why L15 was bad.];B[jb];W[kd];B[ce]
;W[cg];B[cc];W[cb];B[dd]C[H: My dream is for W to play at A and make overconcentrated shape...  He spoiled that dream, of course.

CG: Actually, I don't think extending to E17 (is that the point 'A' you mentioned?) would be bad for white.]
;W[bc];B[ec];W[cd];B[db];W[cc];B[ed];W[be];B[ic];W[jd];B[le]
C[CG: This is strange - connecting at J18 is better.
White lives easily by capturing there, so M15 again looks like a wasted move.]
;W[ib];B[co];W[do];B[dn];W[cn]C[CG This looks like a trick move.]

(;B[bo]C[CG: I think B4 is the correct answer.];W[bn];B[dp]

;W[fp];B[eq];W[bp];B[bq];W[ao]
(;B[fq]C[CG: This is a bad move - white wants to play G4, so you should not force him to play there. Just capturing at D2 is better.]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[hp]TR[em][fn][fo]C[CG: Now the marked stones are weak.]

;B[km];W[kn];B[lq];W[mp];B[mr]
(;W[kk]C[CG: This is a strange move - it not even protects against the cut (see variation). R12 is better.]
