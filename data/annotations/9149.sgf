C[
As I noted, I am now about 4 kyu, and having some trouble finding out what to work on the most, and how.

This game was interesting to me, as I usually do well against 4/5 kyu, but stuggle with 3 kyu. This opponent played solidly and didn't give me too many openings (that I could find).

Thank you very much for taking the time to look at my game.

(I'm white, and lost by 4,5 points (?), with 0,5 komi.)

Hi Henrik,

This is your faithful reviewer, jantje. Remarks are followed by (j) to distinguish from your own remarks and questions.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]C[I haven't really worked on any fusekis as white, so I tend to just play the star points.]
;B[fq];W[hp]C[C6 seems to be most common, but I have had some trouble with pincers, so I decided to play them when not completely inappropriate, so as to get a little more comfortable with them.

I am removing some marks you put in, so that I can make my own annotations and still keep a more or less clear picture. 
The pincer cannot be wrong, but you should already think on what formations may occur and what you want to do with them. (j)]
;B[fo];W[dn];B[fm]C[Black gives even more territory, in order to pressure H6 afterwards. By the same token, H6 has now become light and you shouldn't mind sacrificing it. (j)]
;W[dl];B[dr]
(;W[kq]C[Around here I was very unsure of what to do. C3 or H6 were alternatives I thought of, but G3 might also be good first? I'm thinking mostly of protecting the H4 now. Maybe better at L4 if I do the extension?

C3 is the only move here. If you do not play there now, be sure not to answer if B plays there next move. Otherwise, you have handed B the corner in sente. Anyway H4 should be regarded as light, it is too early to play just to save a single stone. (j)]
;B[cq];W[cp]C[If protecting the corner was not worthwhile a move ago, it certainly isn't now since you have already lost it. But the error is in the previous move. (j)]
;B[qo]C[Very good. Hereafter, no move that W makes on the lower edge will make any serious territory or threaten any B groups (j)]

(;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb]TR[jd]C[Straight to K16 might be better?

Both are OK (j)];B[fc]
(;W[hc]C[Trying another pincer, as I figured this one might work with the top right stones eventually. Especially if I got the L16.

In a moment you will feel that you want to block on both sides simultaneously. (j)]
;B[cc]
(;W[dc]LB[di:a]C[Here I block at the wrong side...? Left is the bigger side, even if it's that long to my stones in the lower left side?

No, this is the correct side. The difference is that the other block is gote, and B can ruin your left side afterwards. For the block an C16 to work you need a stone somewhere around A. See variation. (j)]
;B[cd];W[ce]LB[de:a]C[Is supposedly impossible, surely you've noticed that everybody plays A here? (j)]
;B[cb]C[Here we go with a joseki I did not know.]
(;W[db]C[I have now figured out (I think) that if I play as I did, I can't contain black (he gets left?).
So if I want the left side I have to play D14 og 15 and let him connect?

Exactly, D15 is the move.];B[de]TR[dd][dc][db]SQ[ce]C[According to received wisdom, W should now lose either the triangled stones or the squared one. We'll see that neither happens, which means that you got away lucky. (j)]
;W[bd]C[I should have pushed at E15, since I chose D18, right?

It's a bad loss in any case. Your move has the advantage that you managed to swindle your opponent. (j)]
;B[be];W[cf]C[If a ladder becomes good for W, Black must now go E16 to arrest the 3 stones. In the game, he can crawl once and not even lose B15. (j)]

(;B[bf]C[But in the game B can crawl since the ladder remains good for him (j)]
;W[cg]
(;B[ee]LB[ed:a]C[Should be at A (j)];W[fb];B[gb]
(;W[fd]C[G17 better..?

No, this is a brilliant move (j)];B[ed];W[gc];B[ec];W[eb];B[ff]
;W[bg]TR[fh]C[Debating whether to close blacks corner or attack the center group. I chose to close, but an attack might have been better here.. F12 or something, if so?

This is quite convincingly sente. Anything else you want to play, you can still play because you do not loose the right to move.
(j)];B[ad];W[ca]C[Corner alive, already, so this is just uneccesary?

Same remark: it's sente, and big enough so you want to play it now. (j)]
;B[af];W[ge]TR[ag]C[Since corner is alive, I should first force at A13, so black can't do that later?

Probably, especially if you believe A13 is sente for B now. (j)]
;B[fh];W[eg]TR[ek]C[Hoping he closes, so I can close the left... Splitting might be better?

What do you mean, splitting? You can't cut. On the other hand, you can immediately play D11 if you wish. No need to strengthen B first (j)]
;B[fg];W[di]TR[ag];B[ig];W[hf]C[Now a strange episode begins, which I frankly do not understand too well. For example, one would think than B is going to maintain connection with the marked stone now. But not so... 
And, both players should play at O3 (W) resp. N3 (B) at the earliest opportunity, yet neither does. (j)]
;B[qc];W[hg];B[fj];W[fl]TR[ih]C[Probably very crude and inefficient...

Cutting looks like a good idea to me. Not for its own sake, but with the intention to capture something!  (j)]
;B[hi]LB[gm:a]C[Black helps one of the groups you cut. So now start pestering the other one (play A)]
;W[ih]TR[gm]C[This is also OK (j)];B[hh];W[gl]TR[jh]LB[gm:a]
C[Cut, but I should Play K12 and keep more pressure on the top group, as the bottom group is actually just about safe?

K13 is the honte (honest move) if you ask me, and A is sharper than your move  (j)]
;B[hn];W[eq]TR[jh]C[This always tempts me, but I should just stop thinking it will work..

There's more cutting aji with a stone at H3 instead of H4. And remember that B has just strengthened his connections by getting H6 in (j)]
;B[er];W[fp]TR[jh]C[Just doesn't work..];B[gp];W[ep]TR[il]C[Un√∏dvendig..

I can understand you want to save face here (j)];B[gq]C[Achieved nothing, apart from weakning my own group..

As you say (j)];W[ho]TR[jh];B[go];W[in]TR[jh];B[hm];W[nq]TR[jh]
C[Still a good move, B should have gone N3 earlier to prevent it. Your cut has not yielded results, since both B groups can easily reach safety now. (j)]
;B[jh]C[Big move that I should have prevented a while back?

Can't be everywhere at once (j)];W[ld]TR[qm]C[Too short... Must be at L16 or something?

No, this is OK. (j)];B[je]C[Overplay (j)];W[jf]TR[if];B[jc]
C[I'm not sure what B thinks he's doing (j)]
(;W[if];B[hb];W[ib];B[ke];W[le]TR[ii]LB[ke:a]C[Very slow/inefficient move? J11 and keep the attack going?

Your move seems quite logical to me, but you have already let the B stones escape halfway. A appears to have been the vital point. (j)]
;B[jb];W[ic];B[kf];W[jg]TR[ii]LB[mg:a][qb:b]C[Top group probably lives, so I should focus on attacking, instead of being that concerned with the connection?

W group lives, no "probably" about it.
Perhaps you should think of the safety of your own top right group. A and B (later) come to mind. (j)]
;B[lf]C[Exactly! (j)];W[mf]TR[ji]C[0,07, K11.];B[lh]LB[mg:a]
;W[ii];B[hk]
(;W[ng]TR[hl]LB[mg:a]C[Must do H8? I was a bit concerned about my top group getting into trouble.

This is a correct way to think about it. Not so easy to judge. But if you go H8, J10 becomes ideal for B; the more so because you forced him to play there.
And if you play J10 yourself, Black connects everything by playing at H8; this is not straightforward, see variation.
So defence is a good idea while H8 and J10 are more or less miai. But I'd play A instead of your move. Better shape, and a cut may become feasible someday (j)]
;B[lj];W[jk]TR[ij]C[I basically ask him to connect...

J10 (as you indicate) is much better (j)];B[hl];W[kh];B[ki]
;W[kg]TR[ji]C[K11, 0,023];B[lg];W[ji]TR[mi]C[It is almost as if you were forced to live small, while in fact your group was alive all the time. Your triangled suggestion is better (j)]
;B[ni];W[qg]TR[pg]C[Trying to see if I can do something with his group.]
;B[pg];W[qb]TR[oh]C[Should really break out here?

No, you should be concerned about the honour of the stone you just played. What general sends a soldier to the battlefield only to forget about him immediately? The only moves coming into consideration are the 3 hanes you can play here.(j)]
;B[qh]C[You should develop a feeling that this is big damage (j)]
;W[oh]TR[oo]
(;B[pi]C[I don't like this for B, he is cutting himself (j)]
;W[oi]TR[ph]C[You triangled suggestion is not so hot here, it forces B to take your stone which he should have done in the first place (j)]
;B[pj];W[oj];B[ll];W[ln]TR[ok]C[I saw a chance to make a little bit out of my bottom stones, but the crawl at C9 is very important?

You do not have a really sharp attack on the B group, your move is OK (j)]

Yes, and it's a good opportunity. Black should probably hasten to connect (take the two stones), if he doesn't and you manage to win the ko twice it is a disaster. (j)]

A lively and interesting game, with nice ideas and blunders from both sides. The outcome is quite balanced, with komi W would have won.
An area where both players can grow is "direction of play".
