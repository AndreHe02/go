C[Issue #1 - I am trying to learn to
comment/review my own games, so
criticism of my attempts aand ommissions
is appreciated.  Issues #2 and #3 -
professionals and strong amateur players
say my big weaknesses are middle-game
fighting and taking a big point when an
urgent point exists.  Comments on these
issues would be appreciated.

I am White.

general comments:
you seem a little scared in your fuseki play. if you try to let loose a bit and not be too defensive, you will learn faster even if you lose some games.

the midgame fighting is definitely where this game was lost. the number one thing missing seems to be an instinct to push through an opening. pushing a group through a hole, cutting your opponent apart, is a great feeling, and you should cultivate this. twice in the crucial fighting you didn't do it where if you had, you might have won. recognize this idea and bring it into your heart.]
;B[dq]C[this move should be at R16 to be polite. it's tradition.]
;W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[co];W[op];B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[mp];B[qn]
;W[iq]C[everything seems reasonable at this stage];B[jc];W[fq]
C[Crazyd: Are the left or right sides bigger?

this is a difficult fuseki position. F3 is certainly not small. it stabilizes your bottom group and reduces black's corner. however, i would prefer a move like H17. this would put pressure on black's stone at the top. even if black gets to play G3, this is not absolute sente -- there are standard variations for dealing with a subsequent invasion at L3 (which are too complicated to go into here, but you can do fine.)

the left and right sides aren't as big because black has a low position on both sides, at C5 and R6.

in the end, i'd say that at your level of play, F3 is fine. looking at your problems, there are bigger fish to fry.]
;B[mc]C[now, pay attention: the next NINE white moves are all defensive reactions to black moves. most moves seem reasonable in themselves, but you have to ask yourself, if every move you make is a reaction to your opponent, how can you get the initiative?]
;W[oc];B[fc]
(;W[df]C[Crazyd: Would W-F16, B-G16, W-E17 been a better
choice?

no -- see variation];B[db];W[cc];B[hd]C[this move is slow. F15 or a tenuki would be better. still, the game seems a little good for black.]
;W[cj];B[cl];W[ej]C[this is a perhaps a little slow. the right side is bigger.]
;B[qf]C[black gets the first move on this side, which is nice for him]
;W[qe];B[pf];W[nb]C[Crazyd: Maybe S15 is better direction?

this corner cannot be invaded, so you shouldn't make a slow, small move like O18 now. maybe pincer directly at R11.]
;B[pj]C[this is good for black];W[rf];B[rg];W[re]C[again, this is much too slow and small. your corner is in no danger, so this gote sequence cannot be considered big enough]
;B[lq];W[lp]C[Crazyd: N2 is joseki

yes. you don't want to let black connect. especially since you have the move at F3, you should really be able to attack the M3 invasion.]
;B[kq];W[kp];B[jq];W[jp];B[ir]
(;W[ip];B[hr];W[mr];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq];W[hp]
(;B[fr];W[fp]C[this move is not sente! it's worth only a few points, and is only strengthening a group that is already strong. therefore, this is a huge loss. black has no need to respond here.]
;B[eq]C[this is a terrible move. white had nothing here.

despite wasting a full move, black cannot be considered bad, since white just wasted a move right before this one. this white wall will help reduce the right side, but black has a lot of solid territory.]
;W[el]C[Crazyd: seems even

seems good for black to me. i count about 60 points for black and 40 for white. no weak groups for either side.

this is a very good move, by the way.];B[en];W[fn];B[em];W[fm]
C[this exchange is too early for black. he should wait to see if he can later attack the white wall]
;B[no];W[np];B[on];W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[pm];W[om]C[this cut is bad. but not for the reason of the game...]

(;B[nm]C[this move is unreasonable. white is too strong to start this fight]
;W[ol]
(;B[nl];W[ok];B[nk]
(;W[qm]C[Crazyd: just P10 better?

i like this sequence for white. there's a possibility that black will play P10 right now and give up this stone, so that's the only danger.]

(;B[pl];W[pk];B[ql];W[qk];B[rl];W[rk];B[rm];W[oj];B[nj]
(;W[ph]C[this move has a strange feeling. P11 feels natural, because it increases the white liberties, and means that black has been pushing from behind.]

(;B[pg]C[terrible shape. if you black wants to fix here, at least R13 is better -- that's only bad shape =)]
;W[qh];B[oi]C[key point. white must cry after black plays here. the liberties are now painful for white]

(;W[pi]C[this move is bad shape for white... black will have no difficulty in punishing it]
;B[oh]
(;W[qg]C[Crazyd: losing move - see variation

definitely the last nail in the coffin. however, even if white lives the game still favors black a little]
;B[rh];W[qj];B[ri];W[qi];B[rj])
(;W[qj]C[yes, this lives];B[ri];W[rh];B[qg];W[sg];B[sj];W[sk]
;B[sh];W[rj];B[sf];W[qi]C[but what is white's wall doing now?]
))
(;W[oh]C[still, pushing through and cutting is your only option. if black connects these groups, it's game over whether you live or not

black is still going to have trouble, and cannot save both sides, i would say]
;B[nh];W[og]))
(;B[oi]C[my natural reaction is to play here. white is all of a sudden short of liberties]
;W[pi];B[oh]C[it's gonna be tough to live now for white. and even if white lives, black is safe and out]
))
(;W[oi]C[can you feel the goodness?];B[mh];W[og]C[fighting. probably good for white]
))
(;B[oj];W[ql];B[mi]C[overall, black has lost more than white here, so the original bad move of O7 is still punished. though maybe not as severely as it could be...]

(;B[fp]C[this move looks possible. it leaves a lot of aji, though, so black can play simply without much loss in any case, as in the game]
))
(;W[hq]C[at least this is better]))
(;W[fd]C[this move is valuable when you wish to build something along the left side. here, there's a low black stone at C5, ruining your potential here.

also, the formation of F17 and K17 is open to invasion right now, but after you force black to fix starting with this move, this weakness is gone.]
;B[gd];W[ec];B[fe];W[ed];B[gc]C[black will probably play here as this side is bigger now.

note that all possibility of attacking the black group here is gone]
