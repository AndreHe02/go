C[Hi! This is Bernard, I'm a 1k player living in Hong Kong. I shall do the review for the white side.

The game was pretty much a moyo battle, but both sides made wrong judgements when determining the value of a hand, 'Big and Small' judgements is what we call it in Chinese. Other mistakes include misreading and not sufficient tetsuji training and knowledge. I recommend you do more life and death problems and read more tetsuji techniques.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[qp];B[dj]MA[oq][op]C[*A move around the crossed coordinates might also be considered, kakari that is. It makes best use of the sente you have, expands territory and prevents opponent from shimari.

San ren sei is also a valid and special strategy of course.]
;W[oq];B[nc]MA[qi][qj]C[* If I were black I would've chosen a move around the crossed points because if white gets the chance to play there he can make full use of the right hand lower corner enclosure and would have a strong moyo]

(;W[pf];B[pb];W[qc];B[kc];W[qj]
(;B[hd]TR[kc][nc][pb]MA[jp]C[*This move is pointless, the upper black group is already settled and obviously the biggest move should be at the bottom.]
;W[jp];B[jj]
(;W[nj]MA[mf][hq]C[*This move is way too slow. Black is ahead in moyo, and would be leading if played in the marked coordinates.

White should look for battle or invasion into black moyo, or to diminish the moyo]
;B[cc]
(;W[me];B[ld];W[kf];B[ig]TR[me][kf][ld]C[*The marked exchanges seemed to have just strengthened blacks territory, while gaining little from it.]
;W[gp]MA[fp][fq][cn]C[*I do not undertstand the intention of this move. The marked moves are all better.]
;B[dm]TR[dp][dj]C[*This is very bad move, repeated and 3 stones on the same line will surely lead to weakness. Remember the bad shape.]

(;W[jl]C[*White is aiming too much at forming a boxed territory and keeping up with black. White should try to play more aggressively for improvement and for the win.]

(;B[fj]C[*Too cowardly. All the black groups are strong so black should seek to punish the weak white group by cutting it off. Might not be able the kill the white group but surely will do a lot of good to black and harm to white.]
;W[qb]MA[gm]C[*Forgetting Honte? a move is required to connect]
;B[gn]MA[gm]C[*wrong move. The move at crossed coordinate would have caused more trouble to white.]
