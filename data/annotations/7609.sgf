C[I think this will be a good game for you to review. It reveals some big ideas that you will do well to incorporate into your game. Email me if you have any questions: makubesu@gmail.com

A quick note, I use the term gote a few times in this review. If you are unfamiliar with the term, read this:
http://senseis.xmp.net/?Gote
------------------------
[jokkebk\] I'm playing black, and I'll try to give some notes as to why I've played certain moves in the game.

Should be noted that I haven't yet had any concrete rank, and it seems my opponent atmjr got his 10k rank after resigning to a 9k, so he's probably not that much stronger than me as it seems.]

[qc][qd]C[trying to secure my hold of the corner and expand to the left
---------------------------
Don't look at this move as securing the corner, it is still quite vunerable to an invasion. It is, however, expanding on the left, which is a fine decision.]
;W[jd];B[kc]CR[md][od]C[still securing the corner and trying to avoid direct confrontation
-----------------------------
Your three stones are over concentrated here, and by the end of the exchange white has secured a good chunk of territory on the left.]
;W[ib];B[jb]C[with L17 in place, I felt I could challenge the white a bit
-------------------------------
L17 is not a challenge and is not an attacking move. All it does is strengthen white.]
;W[jc];B[kb]C[L18 for white seemed dangerous so avoiding that. Don't know if M18 or L19 would've been better.
-----------------
L18 is correct, a simple move to secure your stones.];W[ja]
;B[ka];W[ia];B[qh]C[Expanding again];W[ld];B[lc];W[le];B[me]
C[I felt that I should be able to handle possible white invasion to N19
-------------
An invasion at N19? You're completely safe against that. You are correct to push out.]
;W[mf]
(;B[hp]C[top corner didn't seem so threatening at this point, so expanding on the lower left.
-------------
See variation for a good set of moves up top.];W[pj];B[qj]C[It felt that R11 should be able to cut my line]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[pi]
(;B[rj]C[White R12 after this seemed to end up badly for white, so decided to connect here to allow expanding further down
--------------------------
See variation.];W[ql];B[rg]TR[qc]C[I don't fight very well yet, so adding some stones to my own corner. Don't know if I should've played elsewhere.
---------------------------------------
That is a bad habbit to get into. And if you're going to add stones anywhere up top, put one at Q17 and actually secure the corner, not a small chunk of stones. A single move can determine the winner and loser in go, don't waste moves.]
;W[rk];B[ir]TR[cf][nq]C[Letting white to get some space in right bottom corner to expand my territory on lower left.
------------------
No good. Look at what happened when you played a similar move (l17) up top, white ends up secure, and you don't really increase your territory.

Play a big move like C14, or an aggressive move like o3.];W[dj]
(;B[ek]C[White is looking to make use of his wall on the right side and secure a big piece of territory on the top left. 

This move is pretty timid. Look at the variation I show for white, if you consitently play moves like this, white comes out ahead.

I would play something aggressive here, something that exploits that white's D10 stone is weak. Some rough ideas in the variations.]
(;W[gl];B[fl]C[White is getting good hold of the central area, but I thought to secure the corner a bit before going offensive.
------------------------
Going back to what we discussed on the top right: this is not securing your corner very well. White can still easily jump in. 

If you're going to start on the 5-4 points you need to realize that they do not secure the corner. They're influence, not territory based openings.]
;W[fk];B[ej]C[going for a cut so white's wall doesn't become impenetrable.
----------------------
Excellent decision.];W[di]
(;B[dl]C[didn't want to be attacked from two sides in the cut, so securing the corner and strengthening E9-E10 formation
--------------------
Too timid, you have to keep pushing at white. I think you'd be more willing to do this if you realized how weak your corner really is. Feel free to trade it for the left side, as shown in the variation. White mustn't be allowed to secure the top.]
;W[ei];B[jn]C[trying to make towards center
--------------
Great decision here, and the elephant jump is a nice way to do it. Here you're playing a bold move to exploit the fact that k4 is very weak.]
;W[hn]
(;B[hm]C[See variation for some ideas.];W[gm];B[im];W[in];B[fm]
TR[hm][im][jn]C[don't want the white to invade corner too much
---------
Yes but now your stones in the middle are about to be cut off.]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[il];B[km];W[hl];B[fn]C[G6 seemed like a mistake, so staving off white with this. And forgetting to connect at K7 :(]
;W[jm];B[kn]C[new grasp on the center, hoping with luck to connect later to H4]
;W[im]
(;B[ll]C[Wrong direction. You need to attack k4.];W[jk];B[kl]
;W[kk];B[lk]C[White is getting excellent hold of top left, but the top right is deteriorating?]
;W[mj];B[mk]C[Should I have played M10 instead?
--------------
Correct, and here's why: it splits white's stones. Cutting your opponent into separate groups is always a gain for you.]
;W[ok];B[nl]TR[lq][nq]C[going towards corner
-------------------------
Not really. Look how many stones you have in that area. When you have a big clump like that, don't play one or two spaces away. Go after the corner in big strides.]
;W[nk];B[lj]C[Trying also to prevent white from connecting
---------------
Good.];W[li];B[gf]C[Brave attack on the top left..
------------------------
This attack can work, but you'll want to exploit the weaknesses in white's wall below.]
;W[ih];B[of];W[nf];B[ne]C[Watch the last 3 moves over again. You've got a stone G14 that is in serious need of some reinforcements, yet you just played a sequence that ended in gote. Be careful about these things, white could have really taken advantage of this and gone after G14.]
;W[nm];B[mm]C[hoping to form eyes later in case this group gets cut off]
;W[ln];B[nn];W[om];B[lo];W[mp]
(;B[mn]C[M7 looked promising to connect this group, but it seems the eye in N8 is false, requiring another eye elsewhere.
----------------------
n6 is a wasted move, you already have an eye at m6 guaranteed, the white stone is fully secured. You can play a move like shown in the variation.]
;W[on];B[mo];W[no];B[lp]C[going steadily towards bottom and my territory on left]
;W[kq];B[lq];W[lr]C[(the plan of going left and down with black isn't going very well now)]
;B[np];W[mq];B[oo];W[po]
(;B[mr]C[After the game this looks like a mistake];W[nq]
(;B[oq]C[And this even more so];W[nr];B[ns];W[ms];B[kp]C[Abandoning O1 and trying again to connect]
;W[jq];B[or];W[os];B[jo];W[io];B[op]C[Connecting to cut white's territory on bottom right.]
;W[pq];B[no]C[perhaps I should've played Q2 instead to reduce white's area more?
------------------
O5 is a wasted move. Play Q2 without thinking, or even tenuki.]
;W[pr];B[lm]C[Useless move?
------------------------
Yet another useless move. These will really hurt your game, remove them from the game you'll become much stronger.

Think about it this way. When two players of 2 rank difference play, there is a two stone handicap. That means the difference between them is only two stones. So get a few wasted moves out of your game, and you'll be in great shape.]
;W[ol];B[de]C[abandoning O8 to attack the top];W[ee];B[df];W[ce]
;B[ef];W[ff];B[fe]C[Double atari, rare one for me :)];W[fg]
;B[ed];W[ge]
(;B[he]C[As you found out this doesn't work, I recommend one of the variations.]
;W[gd];B[hd];W[hf];B[gc]C[Mistake again, perhaps H13 would've kept white busy a bit longer?]
;W[gg];B[fd];W[gf];B[cf]C[hoping for another double atari];W[hc]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[be];W[fc];B[ec];W[gb];B[db];W[cc];B[bc]C[This ladder seems to go the way I want to]
;W[cb];B[ca];W[eb];B[bb]C[Be proud of your reading skills here, you cleanly beat your opponent.]
;W[ea];B[da]C[Wasted move.];W[eg]C[white's saying "you took my corner!" at this point :)]
;B[ch]C[So I'm going for left side next];W[ci];B[dg]C[Should I have pushed downwards instead of this?
--------------------
Both are small moves. l10 is probably your best move here.]
;W[dh];B[bh];W[bi];B[ah];W[ai];B[bk]C[Small, you're securing 2 or 3 points.]
;W[dk];B[fj]C[I had an idea of making inroads towards white's center to reduce the points
------------
Great.];W[gk];B[el]C[Wasted move :(];W[gj];B[fi];W[gi];B[fh]
;W[eh];B[gh];W[hh];B[ak]C[This move is worth a grand total of 1 point in gote. In the end game focus on the big moves.]
;W[ck];B[bl]C[Don't play moves like this until you absolutely have to. You're letting white push you around.]
;W[bj];B[aj]C[Zero points.];W[gn];B[fo];W[go];B[gp];W[ip];B[iq]
C[Felt like I could handle H3 if that arose];W[jr];B[js];W[ks]
;B[is];W[qc]C[(Now comes an ugly corner invasion, any tips on how black would play better would be greatly appreciated)
--------------------------
Okay, here's where it gets exciting :) White actually has a good invasion here, but you can stop him. The reason why white is succesful here is because you violate an important principle. 

Here's how you usually approach a go problem:
1. Play forcing moves to reduce liberties and space
2. Dive right in and destroy their eyes

With that in mind your best move is something like Q18. It keeps white pinned to the wall, reducing his area to make eyes.]
(;B[qb]C[I've had these corner invasions go terribly wrong for me, so this time I'm trying to keep white away from the very corner, where eyes are easily formed.
----------------------
Instead, you make a contact move. These should be avoided because now white can try and capture your stone, which will usually let him live]
;W[pc];B[pb];W[pd];B[pe];W[ob]C[(looking bad for black in Q18 and R18)]
(;B[oa]C[Bad, see variation.];W[oc];B[nc];W[na];B[pa];W[nb]
;B[mb];W[rb];B[ra]C[This is an obvious mistake, should've played elsewhere]
;W[qa];B[ma]C[Not sure how strong this formation with holes in N17, O16, P15... is?
Thsi formation is relatively strong, and notice that n19 does not create any extra eyes.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[qd];B[pg]C[Started to fear attack from two sides
-------------
Q13 is good, it secures your stones, and pushes against white.]
;W[ph];B[rd]C[See variation.];W[rc];B[sc];W[sb];B[sd];W[sj]
;B[si];W[qk];B[kd]C[Another try to make inroads to white's area. Too bad there aren't any obvious double atari's in white's diagonal wall.]
;W[ke];B[kj];W[ki];B[jj];W[ji];B[ij];W[hj]C[(black got lucky :)]
;B[ik];W[hk];B[ii];W[hi];B[ho]C[Missing a long-standing atari in T9...
------------------
Among other problems, see white's variation. But we all make mistakes like this :)]
(;W[sk];B[sh]C[Wasted move.];W[sf]C[(what is the proper black's response to this move? S14, nothing?)
------------------------
Black must erspond, because if white plays S14 he gets the S15 stones.]
;B[sg];W[cq]C[(commentary in here is shouting for H3 - is it for black to close lines, or white to attack?)]
(;B[bq]C[Another try at staving of the attack in corner..];W[dq]
(;B[cr]C[See variation. Don't let white cut your stones off, stay connected.]
;W[dr];B[dp];W[br];B[cp];W[bp]C[(black losing B3)];B[eq];W[er]
;B[fr];W[fs];B[gs];W[gr];B[es];W[ds]C[(terrible mistake on white's part, thankfully for me)]
;B[cs];W[aq];B[cq];W[bs];B[bo];W[ap];B[ao]C[keeping white at bay seems quite easy now that the corner is filled with black stones]
;W[gq];B[hq];W[hr];B[hs]C[Which is the point where white is deemed to lose this fight? Already from the beginning of this invasion, or later?
--------------------
White losese the fight when he makes the self atari mistake for sure. I believe black can always kill white in the bottom left, but it's a complicated fight and I very likely am missing some interesting variations.]

[dr][er][gr][hr][as][bs][ds][fs]C[I put plenty of comments on specific moves, but I here are some broad ideas to try and improve your game. First, stop making useless moves. You said you weren't good at fighting, so I understand that you're timid, and unsure what moves are worthless. Keep playing, take risks, and solve go problems, and you'll be able to overcome this.

Second, don't underestimate how strong your corners are, especially if you open on the 5-4. Early on white could have invaded either of your corners. 5-4 emphasizes influence, so don't be afraid to trade the corner for a nice wall or territory on the side.

Finally, don't be afraid to play moves far away from your current stones. In your opening I saw nothing but small extensions from your corners. When you do this your stones end up overconcentrated and you fall behind.

Email me with any questions, and best of luck to you. You played a good game, your grasp fo basic fighting was better than your opponent.]
