AB[dd][dj][dp][jd][jj][jp][pd][pj][pp]C[Dear Reviewer,

This is a 9 handicap game between:

B : Lawliet 16k (IGS)
W : chigum 5k (IGS)

I'm Lawliet, taking black on IGS and my rating is about 16k.

Hope you can point out my mistakes and how can I improve my game. Any further comments welcome!

Thank  for reviewing this game :)

dmg: Hello Lawliet,
My name's Damien and I will review your games. I am 4k on OGS, 9k French and around 3k on KGS.
I'll add dmg before all my review and a general comments at the end of the game.
From what I've quickly seen in your games the main problem was slow move played instead of urgent move.
If you want to contact me you can reach me at dmg on OGS or on KGS.]
;W[fc];B[df];W[nd];B[pf];W[jf]C[dmg: Up to there, everything looks ok for me. It's a usual sequence in 9 stones games]
;B[dh]TR[dd][df][dj]LB[dc:A][hd:C][ie:B][ke:D]C[dmg: This move is a little strange. It aims at influence toward center but leave the K16 alone. Preparing for a fight and, at the same time leaving white make things so the fight won't go on that side.

If the goal was to make territory, then the triangle stones are all too high.

For making territory, consider taking the corner in sente with A.
For fight consider escaping your K16 stones either in C, B or D. The fight is favorable for black and black will certainly live with few points for white and you'll probably have C12 later.]
;W[he]C[dmg: As announced, white is closing down K16 and trying to capture large. Trying to get out at L15 is still a good option.]
;B[ne]TR[ja][jb][jc][jd][ka][kb][kc][kd][la][lb][lc][ld][mc]
[md]MA[nf][ng][oe][of][og]C[dmg: There you are forcing white to enclose K16 and reduce the aji of K16 without getting much territory.
Triangles give an estimation of white can get with the sequence against what crosses that give what black can get. It's like giving 10 free points to white.]
;W[me];B[pm]C[dmg: Big point but consider playing lower some time to secure some territory. R7 seems nice here.]
;W[fq]
(;B[dn]C[dmg: Look at the sequence in variation. Also try to play on the 3rd line sometime.
2nd line: line of death :p
3rd line : line of territory
4th line : line of influence];W[nq];B[mp]C[dmg: What did you try to gain with this move ? consider pincer at M3 or H3. Attacking while stabilizing one of your groups.]
;W[np];B[mq];W[mo];B[lo];W[ln];B[ko];W[nn];B[hq]C[dmg: good.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[br];B[fr]C[dmg: atari at D2 first. You can still play F2 later.]
;W[bo];B[cp];W[bp];B[bn];W[co];B[cn];W[do]
(;B[fp]C[dmg: I think it safe to play E5 here. see variation.]
;W[fo];B[gp];W[en];B[em];W[fm];B[el];W[nr];B[mr]C[dmg: Regarding the situation, this is small. R3 is bigger.]
;W[ph]C[dmg: this is a total abuse you should punish. First O14 reinforce you and cuts white.]
;B[qh]C[dmg: did you read it? No needs for trying to connect here since both your groups have eyes space and can goes towards the center.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[qg];B[rh];W[pg];B[pi];W[rf];B[rd];W[ob];B[oc]
C[dmg: bad shape. Except in the yose, don't push a keima except if either your are forced for getting life (this is not the case) or if you can cut (this is not the case).]
;W[nc];B[pb];W[nb];B[od]C[dmg: and you got an horrible shape now. Without real eyes space]
;W[qc];B[qb];W[rc];B[qd];W[rb];B[pc];W[nf];B[qf];W[rg];B[re]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[sh]C[ dmg: ok this is not a big issue. you are alive in the corner and you got some points in the lower right.]

(;B[sj]MA[rk][rl][sk][sl]LB[dc:B][qq:A]C[dmg: slow, slow, and slow. it worth only 4 points. See variation.
A and B are still really big];W[qn]C[dmg: You can probably kill either R6 or the O3 group.]
;B[pn];W[qo];B[po];W[rq];B[qp];W[rp];B[so];W[rm];B[ro];W[sn]
;B[qm];W[rn];B[rl];W[sp];B[qr]C[dmg: nice sequence, now you are ready to attack O3 group if you do thing correctly.]
;W[rr];B[rs];W[qq]
(;B[pr]C[dmg: this is an error, see variation.];W[pq];B[or]
;W[ms];B[ls];W[ns];B[lr];W[mk]C[dmg: I think, this is the part where white starts to win. Until now, mistakes were just compensed by the handicap. But here white is alive on the bottom right corner and can now attack your T10 groups.]
;B[ni]C[dmg: N11 seems ok here.];W[oe];B[pe];W[nh];B[mi];W[jm]
;B[gn];W[fn];B[gm];W[fl];B[fj]TR[hk][hl][ik][il]C[dmg: let me see, slow, not protecting anything, not attacking anything and helping white. Consider playing around triangle stones to connect everything and to prepare the L6 cut.]
;W[gl];B[hj];W[go];B[ho]C[dmg: starting here, the sequence is slow. D17 is enormous.]
;W[hn];B[in];W[hm];B[io];W[ok]C[dmg: this is a gote 0point move.]
;B[pk]C[dmg: 1point move.];W[ol];B[pl]C[dmg: and again];W[oi]
;B[oj];W[oh];B[nj];W[cc];B[cd]C[dmg: I think it's the wrong direction. you should be less passive.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[ec];B[ch]C[dmg: this is the worst move I've seen in the whole game. it's playing inside your territory. If you want to secure your territory, try to play at B16.]
;W[gj]C[dmg: Another big abuse by white.];B[qk]C[dmg: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, punish white. (G11)]
;W[ek]
(;B[dl]C[dmg: I think D9 is ok, see variation.];W[dk];B[ck]
;W[cl];B[bk];W[dm];B[bl];W[ej];B[di];W[bc];B[bd];W[ad];B[ae]
;W[ac];B[be];W[lj];B[li];W[ki];B[kj];W[kk];B[nk];W[ml];B[nl]
;W[nm];B[om];W[kh];B[oo];W[no];B[im];W[il];B[jl];W[km];B[kl]
;W[ll];B[jk];W[oq];B[hk];W[hl];B[gi];W[gk];B[hh];W[ik];B[ij]
C[dmg: until here you get a nice sequence, even thought it's mainly due to white mistakes.]
;W[fh];B[jg]C[dmg: Bu I think you should connect at F11 here. and connect your groups.]
;W[kg];B[hf];W[gf];B[if];W[ie];B[gg];W[fg];B[ff];W[ge];B[kf]
;W[je];B[fi];W[ei];B[eh];W[fe];B[ef];W[ig];B[gh]C[dmg: white not H13 here?]
;W[hg];B[jh];W[ih];B[eg];W[ii];B[hi];W[ji];B[lk];W[bm];B[am]
;W[cm];B[an];W[fd];B[ee]C[dmg: 1point gote. N10 is probably bigger. Anyway, this ends the game mainly. Black has lost when he has failed his attack on the corner.]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[eo];B[ds];W[cr];B[of];W[ne];B[oa];W[na];B[pa]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[lg];B[sl];W[cs];B[es];W[se];B[sd];W[sf];B[jn]
;W[og];B[fk]C[dmg: the last mistake is on that upper corner. S19 is mandatory here. Instead you played a 1point move.]
;W[el];B[kn];W[lm];B[mj];W[ra]C[dmg: seki.];B[sc];W[sb];B[ao]
;W[ap];B[al];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[White: +35.5

dmg:

My final comments:
1/ You are too passive, afraid?
2/ You tend to ignore the value of move and play more on feeling if there's something somewhere.
3/ Sometime you make simple mistake because of lack of reading but it's expected in a 10minute game try to play slower game (20min, not that much) and to pause to read when it's needed.
 
I think you just needs to be cautious on your move and to look at the possibilities and what are they value:
Play urgent points before big points.
Urgent move : move that are threatening to kill/enclosed one groups (either yours or the other).
Big points : points that construct a big potential territory/prevent construction. Or later point that give a big territory.

Question you should ask to choose between big points :
  - Do the move creates territory ? For who and how much ? Is it secured territory ?
  - Do the move defend territory ? How much ?
  - Do the move create potential territory ? How much ? what are the invasions ?

Also, influence is useful for attacking, not much for creating territory.

I hope my comments will help you and make you progress. Keep on enjoying this passionating game.
