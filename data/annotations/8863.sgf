(;B[jk]LB[pj:A]C[W's squared group is not alive yet, but my triangled group is not alive either, and Q12 is not very strong either. I thought about playing q6 or something similar, but I was worried W will start chasing K10 and friends, and ruin my bottom territory once he's strong enough. That's why I played K9. Does this make any sense?

H: I feel that attacking white's group while you have a weak inside group (A) is a bad idea.  A better idea is to put pressure on the group while making territory and safety.  See variation]

I would recommend researching close fighting tactics, since you seemed to find worse results than white when it came to fighting.  This is the final comment.]
