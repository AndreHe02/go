Hi,

in this game I'm black. I'd like some advice cause I fell that I was ahead, but I mess up in move my answer move 96 and the game finished pretty close.

Please point out error in timing and  direction of play, and every pieces of advice are greatly appreciated :o)]

Bad move, isn't it ?];W[ck]TR[io][kp][iq][lq][nq]C[### The reason this move is so powerful is the marked group is  weak, I would look at moves that help the marked group's situation]

(;B[ci]TR[cm][cn][co]C[###Seems a decent response,  moves in the marked area invite white to try and split, I would play C11 here as well.  

Too cramped, and this answer lack of strength ...

### Indeed, but the situation was created before, so now it's more just damage control, and in this case c11 is good damage control.]

You seem to be trying to stop your opponent from scoring any points
Or you could say you are playing like you are behind
It is only important to have more points at the end.  So it is okay to let your opponent make territory, just make more then them.  
In this position, you are way ahead];W[ke]

You may want to study counting
