C[Hi,
in this game I'm black (Eranorn).
I played a chinese opening a thought it wasn"t too bad for me, but I think I made some mistakes, being too submissive for example and lost the game from 3,5 a point.
Can you tell me what is good what isn't in the way I handled this game ?

Thanks for the comment,
Mathieu


This is my first comment
Sorry if my comment and english is not good];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[dc];B[qk];W[nc];B[lc]LB[pf:A]C[Was a play at A also good ?

Both are playable 
bur i prefer at A more 

If white 6 at k 16
i will play with 7at k4];W[qc]C[What I was expecting.];B[qd]
;W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me];W[jq];B[ce]LB[ok:A]C[I thought something like A was too slow, but it now appears to mean as a really strong move, making a moyo on the right, helping both my aboves stones and the bottom 3-4 stone. What do you think ?


- So you should play with 7 at S14
- Black can also play 15 at  n4];W[cd];B[de];W[fc];B[ci];W[pj]
;B[pk]LB[qj:A]C[Well. Crawling at A was probably too submissive. So I intend to make a moyo on the bottom right.

Crawling at A is ok ,
black connected will above group, white has to build a gruop on the center , laster on black can lanch the attack]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[nj];B[ml]C[White stones still under pressure...

-yes];W[of];B[qg]LB[nd:A]C[The first move that I can't really explain... What is the best here ? I just don't wan't him to have a base here, and I'm trying to help my stones to because I found that playing at A was too dangerous and gave bad shape.


- i don' know the  best but this move is ok];W[pg];B[qh];W[qi]
;B[qf]C[Hum... Forced to do that right ? Or is there something better ?

- i would connect at s11];W[nd];B[ph]C[Useless ?

- you should play at O 15];W[oh];B[ri]C[Safer to connect...

- Black 31 is useless now];W[jc]C[Black 7,13 is collasped];B[cn]
;W[co];B[dn]C[Thanks to white I became a quite strong shape.

- yes];W[fq];B[mq]C[Hum... Trying to complete the moyo and have territory on the bottom. Is there something better ?]
;W[oo]C[Really too deep I think !];B[po]LB[mo:A]C[Big mistake don't you think ? Should be at A !

- yes];W[oq]
(;B[op];W[np];B[pp];W[nq]TR[mq]C[White is happy...

yes - Blac triangle worth 30 point, it is a house(like black 19) , not a soilder(like black 7)

i don't know you unserstand my meaning or not :P];B[ne]C[Preparing to attack.

- Black is too wak , he cannot attack];W[oe];B[lj];W[mg];B[mo]
C[Wrong timing ??

Attack at m 4 is better];W[mp];B[fe];W[hd];B[gd];W[gc];B[he]
;W[id];B[ie];W[je];B[jf];W[lf];B[ke];W[le];B[kd]C[Now I have almost a huge moyo in the center ! But this is a mistake I think.]
;W[jd]C[White was nice...];B[fn]C[I didn't find anything else...]
;W[gf];B[ge];W[ef];B[ee]C[Forced to connect right ?

=sure];W[ei]C[Here I don't know how to play.]
(;B[dh]C[-too passive];W[ig]
(;B[hg]C[Was that ok ? I have some doubts...

- you should surround the would group , capturing 3 stone is not big]

;W[fh];B[gg];W[fk];B[ej]TR[hj][ij][ii][ji][jj]C[as a result black 77 help  white stronger and black is over concentrated]
;W[ek];B[dj]C[No choice...];W[em];B[gk];W[en];B[do]LB[cl:A]
C[White A could be embarassing, right ?

If white play A , black can live by c4];W[eo];B[cp];W[cq];B[bo]
;W[dq];B[dl];W[dm];B[cm];W[dk];B[ck];W[hj];B[ii];W[hk];B[gl]
;W[hl]TR[ih]LB[el:A]C[I think there could have been a good ko for white if he play A ad I didn"t answer...

White should play 112 at A if black try to capture 3 white stones white can surroung big territory at the bottom]
