Hello, thanks for the review.In this game black wins by a couple of points. However, I would not say that black should have gained the victory. The reason why I think black won was because white was overly cautious, taking a couple points away to block up cutting points. For this reason I wanted to send the game in for review.

T: Hello, I'm Tim. I'll try my best to give you a proper review, but it's a bit hard as you actually won the game, even though it was a bit close. My comments will start with T.]
FG[259:]PM[2];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[gc];B[cj]
C[T: This is a perfect start for black. White played a standard joseki which gives black a solid group. This is good for black, as you're leading (by default). C10 at D10 would be a bit better (and the real Joseki).]
;W[cn];B[co];W[qn];B[ql];W[nq]C[E.

Im always at a little of a loss over how to react to this move

I remember I pulled up a sequence from eidogo a couple of times in my past games but I didnt for this game.

T: Josekis should be understood, not just played. If you play a sequence from Eidogo, you might want to take the time to ask a stronger player about why this sequence is played as it is.]

This move seemed strange to me

T: It is (:];B[oq];W[or]LB[nr:A][pr:B]C[T. Here, you have two choices, A and B.]

(;B[rq];W[rr];B[rp]C[E.

White's shape has become quite weak as a result];W[qr]C[T: Compare this result with the variations and you'll see the difference.]

(;B[fq]LB[hq:A][iq:B]C[E.

I wanted to do something about white's thickness

Is this too easy going on white?

Should I rather have played at A or B instead?

T: I would probably have played B.];W[kp]C[T: Slow for white, he needs to play more proactively.]
;B[nc];W[qh];B[qj];W[rd]C[E.

This move seemed very strange to me

T: White's playing light and on the key point. Very good move of him.]
;B[qc];W[rc]
(;B[qf];W[rf];B[qd]LB[qe:B][qg:A]C[E.

I feel like this is a bit slow

I didnt want to play at A because it would result in bad shape

Perhaps the peep at B would have been better?

T: Ouch. Not only is the the perfect bad shape (empty triangle), but it doesn't even really do anything. What was your goal?]
;W[qg];B[pf];W[oh]C[E.

Out of all the results this doesn't feel optimal, white is able to jump out into the center and make life on the side

T: What is the result? Black became overconcentrated, while white destroyed the corner, lives pretty much unconditinoally and extended into the center. Very bad result. Compare with variations.]
;B[jd];W[jb]C[E.

I suppose that's what I get for playing with the door open so close to a white group

T: Yes, L17 would be better.];B[kc];W[kb];B[lb];W[gf]LB[gd:A]
[ge:B]C[S.

This feels a bit like an overplay

Its interesting because white isn't playing seriously unreasonable moves, he just plays a little faster than he probably would in an even game

I feel like there is a cutting point somewhere

T: It doesn't really look like an overplay to me. There might be a cutting point there, but you're very lose on the top, so you shouldn't actually try, But you might wanto to use the weakness it creates.]
;B[ge];W[fe]LB[ff:A]
(;B[gd]LB[fd:A]C[E.

Out of all the ways to cut this was probably the worst
T: Could be, yes (:

If white plays at A then im hit on both heads];W[fc];B[fd];W[ed]
;B[ff];W[ee];B[ie]TR[de][cf][df][cj]C[E.

There is a lot of aji

This could go down quite badly for me

The marked stones end up dying because I cant handle white as well from this position]
;W[ef];B[fg];W[eg]
(;B[fh];W[eh];B[hg];W[fi]C[E.

I suppose I should have kept being pushed from behind]
(;B[gi];W[ch]TR[cj]C[E.

Now by black stones are cut off and the marked stone is in trouble]
;B[ej]C[E.

Peep for a free move];W[ei]LB[en:A]TR[cn]C[E.

This stone is also quite weak so I try attacking that instead]
;B[dn]LB[dm:A][en:B]C[E.

After a while this is the best I could come up with but I also considered A and B]
;W[hq]LB[kp:A]C[E.

I should have slid under when I had the chance back when A was played]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[mf];W[nn]LB[mf:A]C[E.

I wasnt sure about this move during the game but now I suppose that it gives white the possibility to expand while capping me at the same time

My move at A on the other hand only helped me to secure territory, a slow move

T: A makes some territory, but Whites move is on the border of moyos, so actually better. If you wanted to play around A, O13 looks more promising.]
;B[bi];W[bh]
(;B[dj];W[gj];B[hi];W[fj];B[hj];W[hn]C[E.

Once again this two point jump];B[kn]TR[in][jn][ln][mn]C[E.

I decide to reduce

I hear that if you play on the border of white's teritory then it is the optimal reducing point

One space higher and its too shallow and once space lower is too deep

T: Good.];W[jm];B[jn]C[T: In general, this direction is questionable, as you wanto to pull L6 out, but I think here, it is possible.]
;W[hm];B[km];W[ol];B[pm];W[pj];B[jl];W[dl]LB[ek:A][dm:B]C[E.

I should take note in the weakness of the shape at A and B

But Im not sure if a would have done me any good]
(;B[cm]C[E.

I was a fool to play this atari

I only made white's position stronger];W[cl];B[ek]C[E.

The atari not only ruined my peep white led to the good variation but now I play this move which I just discovered only makes white stronger

T: Here we are again with the perfect example for bad shape (:]
;W[dm]C[E.

Even if white doesnt push this atari is a problem];B[en];W[fm]
;B[em];W[el];B[fl];W[fk];B[gl];W[bm]C[E.

I figured I might as well cut white off but I dont have enough liberties on my black group to play a liberty race

This is a disaster for black];B[bn];W[cm];B[ao];W[bk];B[hl]
;W[bj]C[E.

At this point I decide to abandon those stones and play away

T: Good decision. As the game is from here on just finishing (which you did okay), I'll stop my review here. 

Main things, you shoudl think about:

1) Shape. Try to get a basic understanding of the standard examples of good and bad shape, and try to play the first and avoid the latter. 

2) Try to play not only straight forward. Keep some flexibility in your think. (upper right !!!).

3) If you  opponen is on your level, the game is even. You tried sometimes to get too much. An even result is a good result.

4) Reading. Train reading, as it's the most basic skill you need for Go.

I hope I could help you a bit with the review. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Cheers,
Tim];B[im];W[ci];B[mh];W[qb]C[E.

White plays a couple of moves trying to make sure my group was dead for sure]

;B[rk];W[qi];B[qk];W[si];B[mj];W[ml]LB[mf:A][mh:B][mj:C]C[E.

I feel like A B and C are all very slow moves Though I suppose it does stop white from making some points I feel Like they may be better spent]

(;B[lk]C[E.

At this point its just end game

The only really interesting thing that happens is that white was too solid and played in order to take most of the aji away]

mercure [7k\]: thx

E.

I feel like I played a solid game, it was just that blunder on the left hand side that all started from that strange two point jump. Instead of cutting it by playing two stones in the center I should have played one stone between and maybe cross cutted or something else. What i played only gave white a lot of aji to exploit

I also lot a couple points due to white taking big points such as that end game on the bottom and a couple of slides which I didnt know how to handle or invited in.

Thanks again for the review.])
