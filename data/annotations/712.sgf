C[Any
comments are welcome. I'm particularly interested in how i would have gone
about reducing blacks large area in the lower center towards the beginning of
the end game.

thanks in
advance.];B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[qd]C[This
move is in error.
Black's natural progression of play from d16 is along the top. r16 can develop
to p17 but its main power points along the right edge.  Black's star-point
stone cries out to be used by approaching at
p16.];B[nq];W[pn];B[jp];W[oq]C[This move
helps solidify b's position on the bottom by expecting o4.]
;B[np];W[gq]C[This deep in b territory, w is likely better playing lightly
on the 4th line.];B[gp];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[ep];W[cp];B[bp]
;W[co];B[bo];W[cn]C[w need not worry about the ladder created if b plays c6
because of r16. Play this at b3 and w gets the corner.];B[hq]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[fq];B[eo];W[go];B[hp];W[gn];B[em]
(;W[bn]C[w has the opportunity to use a variation of the "crane's
nest" tesuji here. w plays e6 instead of b6. Play continues with b f6, w f7, b
d6, w d5, b e6, w e8, b d7 and w c7 begins a ladder that kills b.

This tesuji normally occurs with three stones in a line and another a
one-space jump from the center of the three surrounded by opposing stones on
the bottom and sides of the three stones and one stone extending above the
three on both sides.

Alternately, b could play b3 and capture with the sequence: w b3, b c2, w b2,
b d2, w e2, b b1, w d1.];B[br];W[fm];B[en];W[el];B[gr];W[dm]
C[Without
the threat of capture the "crane's nest" provides, w runs short of
liberties.];B[dr];W[cf]C[A good time to get out of the
fight. Save it for a ko threat later. This extension is a bit wide, though.
Probably better at c11 or maybe c12.];B[ch]
(;W[dg];B[dh]C[This little wall bodes ill for w. w has
cutting points in his shape at f8 and d8. Probably better for w to use a
joseki stemming from e14 insead of
d13.];W[cd];B[cc];W[de]C[w is trying to squeeze
life into a small space here. In the process, b gains secure territory on the
top and a light group extending to the middle below.];B[ed]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[bg];B[bh];W[cj];B[dj];W[dk];B[ej];W[qj]C[A
big point but neither of w's groups on the left are
settled.];B[oc]C[b finally heeds the call of his star-point
stone.];W[pf]C[w concedes to the approach with this
move.];B[kc]C[Now b's power strides across the top with vigor. w
still has hope, however, because this extension is a bit too wide. n17 would
bring out some tough fighting.];W[hc]C[A good move but might be
better one line up.];B[gc];W[gd]C[h16 is probably a better response here, leaning toward
invasion at
n17.];B[hd];W[id];B[he];W[fd];B[fc];W[fe];B[ee];W[ff]C[b
has the opportunity to continue this direction of attack with e14, isolate and
kill the w c14 group.]
(;B[ic];W[hb];B[jc];W[ie];B[hf];W[fh];B[jf]C[b
is building good territory into the middle.];W[pc]C[And w helps here
by encouraging b p16 building a wall.];B[gj]C[But b makes a good move
to take advantage of his light group on the left. This is the beginning of big
b territory in the lower left.];W[hg];B[if];W[hi]C[Again, w squeezes along with moves in tight
spaces. A move like f8 opens up more possibilities by  stablizing the w group
and threatening b's b12 group.];B[hj]C[b's wall in response builds  his influence.]
;W[fj]C[A curious play by w. f9 would be
better.];B[fk];W[fi];B[fl]C[The game is about over
for w at this point. b has staked out very big territory in the lower left]
;W[ck];B[ek];W[dn];B[dl];W[cl];B[el];W[nc]C[This move is
better at p16 to counter b's central influence from the group to the left.]
;B[mc];W[od];B[nd];W[nb];B[mb];W[ne];B[md];W[ob]C[The need to capture here loses sente for w and
allows b to take advantage.];B[jj];W[ef];B[ec]C[at this
point what would be the best way to go about reducing the
hudge black moyo in the center/lower side.

Now is likely too late to start. But if this is all you've got, erasing moves
that connect to your right side are good.];W[lp]C[This is a
fairly standard "erasing" move used in areas where the opponent has lots of
influence and aimed at reducing territory.];B[lq]
(;W[nm]C[The usual response here, though, is to move to the center.
Where exactly is difficult to say as nearly any move is going to spark a fight
with b. And b's influence in the area makes any fight tough for w.]

move and the following in the middle are small. w could profit by a play to
settle his c6 group.];B[kg];W[lj];B[kj];W[ki];B[ji];W[eh];B[di]
;W[gi];B[ak]C[b's
monkey jump cuts into w's loose shape, removing the possiblity for eyes.]
