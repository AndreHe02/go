C[Thank you for reviewing this game !
I had Black and played a very young and aggressive opponent on KGS. As he stated after the game,
he lost because of playing with too many weak groups at the same time (after my cut at J5). Still this
boy is technically amazing for a 9k.
My questions are about my probably trivial errors during the opening phase, especially during his two
invasions on the lower left, and on my treatment of the remaining free areas of the board later in the game.

Hi, I'm ACAB on kgs. I will try to review this match. my comments have a *.]

crhohmann [9k\]: yes


*the influence you built in the center was foundamental to win this match and you gained it attacking k9 group. 
Also if you wasn't able to kill it, it was satisfactory to you. This is the reason why it's not good to have many weak groups on the goban.
White played with too many groups while black played very solidly. Remember also to be aware of consequences of your tenukis.

Feel free to ask me (ACAB) on kgs for further explanations or variations.

I hope my work is satisfactory.Goodbye])
