C[J: Hi my name is Jorik Mandemaker and I'll review this game as requested by Black. I've marked my comments with a J. Remember that I'm only around 9k myself so take my comments with a grain of salt. if I use some terms you don't understand you can look them up at SL (http://senseis.xmp.net).]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[qn];W[ec];B[dc]C[J: This move isn't so good withouth a pincer in place. See the variation for the next white move. Instead I would suggest O3. The upper right corner is quite balanced as it is so you can take advantage of white's tenuki from the bottom right.]

(;W[hc]C[J: White should play E16. See the variation.]
(;B[nq]C[J: Since white didn't play E16 you should quickly grab it. See the variation.]
;W[nn];B[oo]C[Was this a mistake?

J: I would play like this too. White's diagonal jump invites this cut.
R3 is an alternative.];W[pn];B[po];W[qo];B[qp];W[ro];B[pq];W[rp]
;B[qq];W[rq]
(;B[rr]C[J: This move is pretty small. I would Play S7. See the varation.]
;W[sr];B[rs]C[J: Again this is small.];W[qm]C[I didnt think there was too much more to do here, should I have reenforced this more?

J: See the previous comments.];B[fq];W[hq]
(;B[cn]C[Would it have been better to play toward the right side to work with the bottom right corner?  white turned that space into big territory later on.

J: I've got a bit mixed feelings here. On one hand.White's pincer seems a bit close to your strong lower right.
You can counterattack. See the variation. On the other hand, the left side does look bigger then what you can do on the bottom.]
;W[fp];B[dq];W[cq];B[cp];W[eq];B[dr];W[fr]C[J: White should play E2 right away. At the end of the game sequence F2 becomes wasted.]
;B[bq];W[er];B[do];W[ep];B[dk]C[J: This is bigger then the corner indeed.]
;W[ds]C[J: C2 instead would capture the two stones. But it is small. Better to tenuki.]
;B[cr];W[cf]
(;B[df]C[Was this the right play or should I have played under or closer to the bottom?

J: White C14 is weak and the E17-H17 combination isn't strong either. You should attack! But touching moves such as D14 are for defense not for attack. See the variation.]
;W[de]C[J: It's better to hane on the other side straight away.]
;B[ce];W[dg];B[ef];W[di]
(;B[cg]C[J: Just capturing one stone is playing on a small scale. White will just give it up to help here other stones. You should try to attack on a larger scale. See the variation.]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[be]C[J: This move should be ommited just play C12 right away.]
;B[bd];W[ch];B[bh];W[bi];B[af];W[ah];B[ae];W[ck]
(;B[ee]C[Was this a good play or should I have grabber more territory play toward the middle or somewhere around C8?

J: C8 definiatly. White's stones are not alive yet so don't give them an easy time. E15 hardly does anything. It only captures one stone which white wasn't going to bother saving anyway.]
;W[bm]C[J: Now white can settle herself easily.];B[bn];W[cm]
;B[dm];W[cl];B[dl];W[dj];B[eg];W[dh];B[fi]MA[ee][ef][eg]C[J: This doesn't seal white in completly and is gote. Since you managed to build the marked wall it's time to put it too use. There are two weak stones right in front of it begging to be attacked. Play K17 instead.]

(;W[lq]
(;B[mr]MA[ec][hc]C[looking back this does not seem like a good answer, would somthing like M4 been beter?

J: Your group is allready alive. White neglected to defend her marked stones. So instead of responding go and attack them! 

Locally it is normally best to keep access to the center and M4 would work. However I don't think N2 is that bad because white can't seal you in that easily and even if he manages the bottom is undercut by N2.]
;W[np]
(;B[op]C[J: This is too passive however. See the variation.]
;W[mq];B[on]C[I was trying to escape toward the middle here

J: That is the right idea.];W[pm];B[om];W[nr];B[sq]C[I thought I was going to get him into a connect and die but he didnt go for it

J: White answered correctly. T3 is best saved for the endgame.]
;W[sp];B[ss]C[J: T1 only creates shortage of liberties for black.]
;W[rn];B[oq];W[pr]
(;B[qr]C[looking foward I think maybe I should have let  the 3 stones in the corrner go, but Im not sure

J: Yes, it's better to make an eye. See the variation.];W[or]
;B[mp]C[J: Hmm. There seems to be just enough aji in white's position to make this work but unless you've read all the variations out i'd advise something more simple like o7.]
;W[no];B[mo];W[nm];B[ol];W[lr];B[ml];W[mn];B[ln]C[I know I wasnt going to capter the stones but I wanted to escape toward the middle

J: this was a good combination.];W[lo];B[nl];W[lm]C[This was a huge mistake by white, I offerd him an undo but he didnt want it.]
;B[mm];W[kn]
(;B[pg]TR[ec][hc]MA[dk][dl][dm][do][ee][ef][eg][fi][ml][mm]
[nl][ol][pd]C[The lower corner is secure with good influnce toward the middle and the right, I am not sure if I should have tried to invade to bottom middle, but the upper right turned into some great territory for me

J: You can't invade the bottom. White will kill you. You can only reduce it from the outside. But looking at the board we see that you have a lot of strength everywhere (marked). White has a weak group (also marked) on the other hand. You should attack at K17! See the variation.]

(;W[pj]C[J: The group on the top should be defended at L17 (for example) first.]
;B[lc]C[J: You're holding back too much. With your strength and white's weakness you can go all the way to K17.]
;W[qh]C[J: This is pretty much suicidal.]
(;B[rg]C[J: Too defensive. See the variation.];W[qg];B[qf];W[rh]
;B[sg]C[J: Bad! White gets a free move at T12 now. Just connect at S13 and later T12 will be sente for you.]
;W[sh];B[re];W[ph];B[og];W[ni];B[pk];W[qk];B[ql];W[pl];B[ok]
;W[oj];B[rl]C[I think I should have just let the middle right go at this point.  But I thought I might find a way to kill off that white group

J: Not a chance. The top white group is still very urgent and the last dozen moves or so should all have been around there. Aswell as the next dozen.]
;W[rm];B[qj];W[rk];B[mg];W[lj]
(;B[km]C[I was trying to extend to the left

J: M4 looks like a better starting point to reduce the bottom.]
;W[ll];B[ko]C[for some reason I didnt see white's next move]
;W[mn];B[nn]C[J: unnecesary, white can't kill.];W[lp];B[ln]
;W[jn];B[lk];W[kl];B[kk];W[jl]C[J: White is happy about increasing her bottom territory.]
;B[mk]C[I think that move may have been unneeded

J: The cut is protected.];W[mj];B[ij];W[en];B[dn];W[kb]C[J: Good. White finally notices her weak group.]
;B[lb];W[kc];B[le]C[J: Hane at L16 is standard good shape.]

;W[oh];B[nh];W[mh];B[ng];W[ke];B[lh];W[mi]
(;B[kd]C[I think I should have played more toward the middle or somewhere in the H8 area

should white have played this differently?

J: Yes.];W[sl]

J: This should be at T10.];B[kj];W[oi];B[sj];W[sk]C[At this point in the game I thought I was behind im, still not sure.

J: White is a little ahead, around 5 points. But it's Blacks move.]

(it ends up in SEKI due to a white error)

[ks][ls][mr][ql][qn][rl][sm][sn][so]C[Black wins by 5.5 points.

J: My overall advise would be to consider the strength of groups more often. If you have a weak group you should add a move to defend it or else your opponent might attack you. 

On the other hand if you don't have weak groups but your opponent does have one then you should attack. Not to try and kill it but to make profit while attacking. Remember that attacking moves are generally not contact moves.

Also during the opening think on a large scale. Don't play moves worth only a few points early on.]
