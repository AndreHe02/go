;B[qd]C[Hi, thanks for taking the time to submit your game for review, always great to look at new games! I'll mark my comments with a C so you know it's me.

Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking over my game. It was played on Tygem with standard time controls with me as white. This was a very simple one, in that my opponent decided to take all the edge territory and then live everywhere else. And it worked, in the end of the game I had maybe 10 points at best. The question then is "how to kill". There's nothing else to say, please instruct me in the art of killing an opponent who is determined to make you either kill him as the only way to win and won't stand for you getting even 20 points of territory. Looking forward to your advice.]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[nc];W[po]C[C: The opening is classic.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[qe]C[C: The attachment is light and flexible, but personally I'd stick to more standard moves unless you've specifically studied the position in question and know what you want to do as follow-ups.

this is probably too fancy. It's supposedly ok against a normal enclosure, but here maybe it's not actually good. Nevertheless black demonstrates his style now: "I take the edges, you take the middle, I live in your middle."]
;B[rd];W[pd];B[pc];W[od];B[oc]C[I decide that I can't play S15, since black would cut right away. Not knowing how to follow up on that side I decide to play lightly and return to the bottom before black cuts at Q6]
;W[pm];B[re]C[C: This is a very territorial move, I'd prefer to cut myself.

black wants the second line edge.];W[oq];B[or]C[black doesn't even try to fight back in the center. He just wants the second line.]
;W[pp];B[pr];W[nq];B[nr];W[lq];B[mq]C[C: If you don't like this shape, the direct extension at N3 instead of M3 is fine as well. A bit more solid, which sounds like exactly what you were looking for. 

I actually don't like this shape for white, even if it's supposed to be good, since it's a tenuki joseki... what do I do here?]
;W[mp];B[mr]C[C: After O5 your group is very strong. I'm interested to see how this will become the weak group.

No idea how to fix. Everybody tells me this is thickness, but in my games it's a weak group.]
;W[no];B[lp];W[kq];B[mo];W[np];B[lo];W[mn];B[qf]C[C: I think it's a fair trade.

I decide that taking the 3 stones in the center is bigger.]
;W[ln];B[kr];W[jq];B[jr];W[iq];B[ir];W[hq];B[fq]C[again no idea what to do here.]
;W[hr]C[C: This is the correct response.];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp]
;W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[dn]C[C: I think this move is fine.

probably shouldn't have played this. You wouldn't think at this point that it's still possible to loose this as white, but YES IT IS.]
;B[ql];W[cm]C[C: It is the punishment, but at this point it's too small. I would prefer to attack R8 directly.

trying to punish black for not responding to D6...];B[bn]C[don't know how though.]
;W[qi]C[C: I actually don't think this is the wrong direction. The correct way to use the thickness is to attack, it would be too passive to play from the other side and simply create the moyo. I would consider Q11 here as well, since there's still some life to your three stones in the top right. You've already played for the center thickness, so I like the fourth line play a bit better. If black slides under, the white wall will be too big.

wrong direction by me.];B[dm];W[cl];B[rn];W[ld]C[ladderbreaker]
;B[me];W[of];B[pf];W[og];B[oe];W[le];B[md]C[bad move by black.]
;W[em]C[I take the ladder and now the fun part of the game begins.]
;B[jc];W[hc];B[fm];W[dl];B[jm]C[this is basically black challenging me to kill him. I don't even want to. I try NOT to kill him. And not even that works.]

(;W[hm]C[C: This is the first bad move from white. Remember, you want to attack from distance. It's ideal to play away from the group you're attacking unless you're specifically taking away eye shape. Consider M8 here. You want to attack from the weak side and strengthen that group a bit, then look to take advantage of the fight to create a big territory in the top left. Give black some space and force him to live small.]
;B[hl];W[gm];B[fl];W[gl];B[fk];W[gk];B[fj];W[di]C[C: Yup, that's the right idea.

trying to split and profit];B[fn];W[fp]C[wrong move by me. Both sides are fine, that stone is small. Rather play something like H5]
;B[go]C[I decide that this is too slow by black and try to surround and take the remaining board while letting black live.]
;W[fh]C[C: I would prefer to play from the other side. M8 is still an attractive spot.]
;B[io];W[gj];B[gp]C[I should ignore this.]
(;W[gq];B[ko];W[in]C[C: This is poor. You're forcing black to create good shape. Always remember "attack from distance". I would consider M8 here, which keeps up the pressure and helps your right side group. You said yourself it's ok if this group lives, but if it does, you need to force black to live small and take the whole outside. Notice J6 is not on the outside, so what's the purpose of the move?]
;B[jn];W[il]C[I just want the territory...];B[jl];W[jk];B[im]
;W[hk];B[ll]C[C: M8 was the important point and black has played it first.

at this point the game is starting to look lost... Black will take the last corner for sure and there isn't even anything I could do about it (like playing a move to secure it wouldn't prevent black from invading anyway and succeeding at it)]
;W[ml];B[kk];W[jj];B[mk];W[nl]C[C: The groups has become weak because of M8. Consider the position if white had played M8 first.]
;B[on];W[pn];B[nk];W[pl];B[qk]C[that greed...];W[ok];B[oj];W[pj]
;B[pk];W[ol];B[pi]C[black's greed is very real...];W[nj];B[qj]
;W[mj];B[kj];W[ki];B[lj];W[li];B[lm]C[I make this exchange, which seems sente and helps my connection]
;W[lk];B[mk]C[C: It's almost always good to play sente moves. Black groups is very big, it would be nice to see his response to H6 at least. It wouldn't be enough for black to secure the top right then because of the white outline on the top left.

Here is a crucial moment in the game. I was thinking about playing H6 here but then decided that it's too dangereous. I don't want to kill black. I just want to secure my top left. I'm even fine with black getting the corner... but no, of course not. Here I probably MUST try to kill.]

(;W[mg];B[hn];W[lc]C[C: Yes, white let's black off too easy. This move might be considered a bit greedy, but given the overall position of the board, white has to play actively to make up the points.

So I let black live and now I'm trying to get the rest of the board as territory, which is enaugh to win. This is too greedy  though. I should secure the corner maybe...]
;B[cc]C[black takes the corner as expected.];W[dc];B[fc]C[no, black doesn't want the corner after all. He wants everything. Note how I have absolutely no territory anywhere. Also black is obviously not thinking about any his moves for more than 2 seconds.]
;W[gd]C[C: This move is too passive, building the wall now is not enough for white I think.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[bg]C[here I make a mistake.]
;W[cb];B[ch];W[dh];B[bb];W[ci];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[ec];B[bh]
C[C: Locally, the result is not bad, but black has many chances to reduce the center. I'm actually not sure if white has enough points even if the center outline becomes all territory.

this could have gone a lot better. If I kill the remaining two stones I'm still winning though. As if I could kill this guy's stones.]
;W[rm]C[C: I'm not sure if the points are enough. Black still has a few reducing moves.

In fact I'm too bad at counting to know I'm winning already, so I decide that I need to kill the two stones without playing another move in the area first and start playing endgame.]
;B[qh];W[ro];B[rp];W[sn];B[dg]C[The rest of the game is just really sad. I have nothing else to say about it. Maybe you do?]
;W[de];B[fd];W[fe];B[gc];W[hd]C[C: H15 here would give the group a few more liberties. You have to worry a little more about the cut because of the black stone on D13.]

;B[gg];W[ff];B[hh];W[ib];B[ic];W[hd];B[jb]C[C: You didn't play badly at all in the first half of the game. The theme I notice though is that when you attack, you always play very close to your target. This is generally the opposite of what you want to do. What ends up happening, as I'm sure you've noticed in this game, is that the opponent stones become stronger from the contact and then your groups on the outside, like Q8 and E18, become weak. You want to play further away, aiming to strengthen your groups on the outside and either force your opponent to live small or build a wall when he is running.

I resign.])
(;W[hn];B[mi];W[ni];B[mh]C[This seemed like black would find SOME way to live for sure, and in the worst case it's by winning the capturing race. I didn't want to do it.]
