C[Hi, Mi name is Paco, Im playing in KGS as 7k, but is because I´ve been a long time not playing so I loosed rank. I used to be 4k. 

I will start my comments with P.

If I say a move is bad, I will make a variation

In general you should improve:

1. Dont touch the group you are attacking. This way you reinforce them

2. Take care of your cutting points when you attack

3. In some special moments of the game. Stop and calculate the movement till the end because on it deppends if you win or not

4. Look at the whole board and see if some groups need to be saved, some parts of the board are empty...in general, when a fight is over, do that.

5. Dont fight trying to kill but trying to take profit];B[pd]

;W[pb]C[P: Till this moment I don´t see anything to comment. Everything is so normal]
(;B[jc]C[P: You are playing in contact with your oponent. There is a rule about the contact: when you are in enemy side, you should play contact. What is called sabaki. In general contact reinforce your enemy. Ther contact will lead to a fight where he will be reinforced. Both of you will have a lot of stones there, both of you will live, and in the end you will loose advantage. As a rule, contact in enemy side, but not contact in yours]
;W[ic]
(;B[jb]C[P: You are takin few territory here, and not living yet. What is the purpose of this move?]

(;W[md]C[P: He has been already divided. The fight is over in this side. Time to go to other part of the board]
;B[od];W[me];B[mc];W[nb]C[P: worthless]
(;B[mf]C[P: You have spiltted theese three stones and that is very good. This stones should die. Is important for you to assure you will kill, because it seems that this way you assure the match. But there are better ways to do that. 

1. Remember about contact and sabaki. The stones are in your territory. You shouldnt contact

2. He has no space to make eyes. You can stop him from scape more far. Taking more terrirory and making sure he doesnt scape]
;W[nf];B[mg];W[ng]C[P: Again. Take care of your own group. right one]
(;B[nh];W[oh];B[og];W[oi]
(;B[ph]C[P: He has three liberties and you far more.  This move dont seems to be necesary. But there are cut points that you should look at . M12.

You should follow some rules in the fight:

1. What I already said about contact.
2. Moments like this are really important. Take a moment to calculate everything till the end. Calculate exactly the risk for O12 stone and for Q16 group. You play by intuition but im some moments of the game you have to calculate
3. You pay too much attention to kill. But you try it letting too much cutting points and debilities. You should attack thinking always that even if you dont kill, you are using the attack to make territory or thickness]
;W[mh];B[ni];W[nj];B[mi];W[lh];B[mj];W[lf]
(;B[mb]C[P: In this cases is better to scape. As a rule, surround your enemy and dont let him surround you. Live scaping]
;W[oj];B[nk];W[ok]
(;B[lk];W[nl];B[mk];W[pk];B[ql]C[P: You add a weak group more to take care of. Better reinforce your groups.]
;W[pi];B[qj]C[P: Uf, you want to save all your stones. You have to decide who will live and who will live, because if not, everybody will die]
