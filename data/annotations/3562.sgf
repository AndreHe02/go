(;B[dl]C[Velirun:  I would have done the more normal low move at C9.  D8 could get a little weird in relation to the upper right corner.]
;W[de];B[cg]C[i wasn't sure what to play here - i think a pincer is right, but maybe not this one...

Velirun:  Pincer may be ok... but if you played the two space extension at D9 before, attachment under at C15 would be ideal.  See variation a few moves ago.  In relation to the lower left, the standard continuations from here seem ok.]

(;W[ec]TR[bg]C[what if white turns at the triangle? i think as the ladder is bad, i shouldn't p[lay the pincer that i did

Velirun: This result seems not so good for white.  He's settled easily, it isn't so good as the more standard continuation.  See variations.

Velirun: White could have turned instead of capturing, but it turns into a fight that is not good since you have good stones in the area.  See variation for a simple, somewhat standard variation.]
;B[bg]C[Velirun: This move should be at D13 instead.  It accomplishes its purpose better.]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[od]C[Velirun: Good direction.];B[qg]C[Velirun:  This move is normally used for either safety or for negating thickness.  It is a loss in this case.  I would consider the lower one-space pincer in this case... but this is just an opinion.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[lc];B[hq]TR[kd][je][ke][le][jf][kf]
[lf][qn][nq]C[I wasn't sure where to play here - i guess the triangles are all big places to play. Maybe the top is not urgent yet so the bottom somewhere is best?

Velirun:  Top seems most important.  This area gets much bigger with every move white adds.  I would play the shoulder hit at L16.

Velirun:  Uprooting the D4 stones is a good idea, but I'd try to be more subtle about it, aim at it.  At this point, it would probably be slow for white to come back and fix this weakness.]
;W[jq];B[ho];W[fn];B[jp]C[Velirun: Bad exchange - maybe you'll want to attack this later.  You must use your strength to attack the F4 group first.]
;W[kq];B[kd]C[perhaps i should play along the right here? My formation on the top right is safe but takes no real territory so i think that maybe an extension is not big along the right. I decided to wait until i thought it was right to invade the bottom right 3-3

Velirun: Reducing here is important.];W[kc];B[jd];W[ic];B[he]
C[Velirun:  A little dubious... two space extension toward the center would be typical.]
;W[hd];B[gd]
(;W[fd]C[Velirun:  Strange.  How about the variations?]
(;B[ge]C[Velirun:  Seems painfully slow.];W[fe];B[id]C[Velirun:  Oops!  See the previous variations.  You destroy your own chances!]
;W[hc];B[gc]C[Velirun: Not a very important point.  It destroys some white profit, but has no strategic value.]
;W[eg];B[me]C[I felt this went ok - maybe white could have punished me more...]
;W[ld];B[le];W[dj];B[eh]C[Velirun:  Attacking is not my strongest point, so it is hard for me to say the best way to profit while attacking this stone.]
;W[fh];B[ei];W[ek];B[fi];W[gg];B[el];W[fk];B[fl];W[gk];B[ck]
TR[dh]C[i was concerned about the weakness at the marked point- it came back to haunt me...

Velirun:  Another slow move.  You can still attack these stones!]
;W[bq]C[Velirun:  Pretty big... but too early.  Is white afraid?]
;B[db];W[eb];B[bb];W[da];B[jc];W[jb];B[ib];W[kb]C[shame i wanted to attack the top right...]
;B[gb]C[Velirun: Better to just remove them.  Or better yet, tenuki.  It's just a few points.]
;W[kp];B[jo];W[cj]C[should i answer this to protect the cut? i think probably i should]
;B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[oq];W[nq]C[Velirun:  White's fighting for sente to make the extension.]
;B[nr];W[mq]C[Velirun:  Could and probably should tenuki here for the extension.]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qj]C[when white leaves the bottom right to extend there is a lot of aji left, i was not sure how to use the weakness - what is good?

Velirun:  Good possibilities exist with the pincer-attachment.  See variation.]

(;B[ko]C[i thnik this was a big move territorially, to stop white make a moyo...

Velirun:  Rather hard to perfect a moyo.  You should aim to attack white's group at F9 - the moyo will get destroyed eventually.]
;W[bk]C[...but this hurts];B[bl];W[bj];B[dk]TR[ej]C[to create the weakness at the marked point

Velirun:  White should have ataried, of course.];W[bm]
(;B[ej]C[this was probably too aggressive, no?];W[al];B[cm]
;W[bn];B[bo];W[co];B[an];W[cl]C[this has become a big ko now.

Velirun:  I think you can fight it.];B[cp]C[this would at least salvage something in the corner

Velirun: Wrong atari.  D5 much better.];W[do];B[bl];W[dh];B[am]
TR[nb][eh][ei][fi][ej][mo]C[i originally thought that that i would have more liberties for the marked group when i cut, but, although it is painful me to give up the stones, i think i have no more ko threats. the marked points might work , but i am not sure white will answer, and the loss on the left would be bigger than the likely gain. What do you think?]
;W[gi];B[fr]C[i couldn't find a better way to remove white's base here.]
;W[eq];B[er];W[dr];B[rb];W[qb];B[ql]C[this is a poor way of using the aji in white's position, but i couldn't see the best way, so i wanted to stay away from it for a while...]
