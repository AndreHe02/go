C[Dear reviewer,

My name is Peter Hoehe from Germany.
This is a game I played today during a tournament in Essen, Germany.

I would like to hear your comment about the strategy taken, esp. in the opening.

I think  I was behind after the opening, and I had to fight. Do you agree?

I can't memorize the game to the end. In fact it was very close.

I'd like to hear your comment

Peter

[EV\] Hello, this is your reviewer Eric Vella.  My comments will be marked [EV\].  This was a good game.  I agree you fell a little behind in the opening.  The fighting in the middle is too complicated to comment on accurately, but I do have some comments on the opening strategy.]
;B[cp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[nq];W[eq];B[gq];W[eo];B[dn];W[en]
CR[gq][nq]C[[EV\] Pushing from behind like this is generally regarded as a little better for B, as he makes fourth line territory.  In this game, I think it is quite playable for W, anticipating a strong attack on the two marked B stones.]
;B[dm];W[jp]LB[kp:A][kq:B]C[[EV\] I would play one space to the right, farther from the stronger side, at either of the marked points.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[cr];W[dp];B[cq]
(;W[ho]C[[EV\] This captures one stone on too small a scale.  The resulting W position will soon be over-concentrated.  See previous variation for an alternative.]
;B[er];W[fr];B[ds];W[fq];B[em]CR[nq]C[[EV\] B got a good result up to here.  This turning move is tempting, trying to make W even more over-concentrated, but I don't think W really has to answer, so the timing seems wrong.  B should instead defend the lone marked stone, and W should tenuki to attack it.]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[gm]CR[nq]C[[EV\] The B corner is much larger than the W side, for the same number of invested stones .  W compensation is the weakness of the marked B stone, but I do not think this is enough to make up for the territorial loss, since B now has sente to defend.]
;B[qn]LB[lq:A][pq:C][pr:B]C[[EV\] This is playable, but it seems needlessly complicated.  Why not just defend directly?  Any of the marked points would let B settle his stone fairly comfortably, without giving W too much additional territory.]

(;W[np]C[[EV\] I would attach on the other side, to capture this stone on a large scale (see previous variation).  After this attachment, it looks like B can live inside the W moyo (see next variation).]

(;B[qq];W[oq];B[qp];W[om]C[[EV\] W swallowed up the B stone along with a large side territory.  The game now looks close.]
;B[on]LB[pl:A]C[[EV\] Playing at A would be normal and fine for B.  The game sequence lets W jump out ahead on this side.]
;W[nn];B[pn];W[ol]C[[EV\] Connecting solidly would be usual and good, but going for the maximum like this seems playable too.]
;B[gl]C[[EV\] Good timing.  I am not sure who gains more from the continuation, but letting W turn here would be bad, particularly after the last W move.]
;W[hl];B[hk];W[ik];B[il];W[hm];B[ij];W[jk];B[hj]
(;W[jj]LB[ch:A][dh:B]C[[EV\] The last few moves were forced.  This W move is also large, but does not seem necessary.  The W moyo is geting narrower, so I dont think pushing here is big enough, even if B answers.  Invading the upper left side while it is wide open seems more urgent.  W can split the side, with room for a two-space extension in either direction, at either of the marked points (probably the higher move is a little better).  Another possibility is shown as a variation.]
;B[cf];W[jh];B[hg];W[hh];B[gh];W[gg]C[[EV\] Here the fighting gets too complicated for me to analyze properly, so I will only add a few more comments and variations.]
;B[ih];W[ig]
(;B[hi];W[hf];B[ji]
(;W[ki]C[g4: Obviously wrong. I think I had to take a stone.

[EV\] Probably true, but it would still be a difficult fight for both sides.  You give two variations which end badly for B.  I added a third which seems better.]
;B[jg];W[hh];B[kh];W[fh];B[hg];W[df];B[de];W[hh];B[gi];W[jf]
;B[hg];W[cg];B[ce];W[hh];B[ef];W[eg];B[dg];W[dh];B[ff];W[fg]
;B[hg];W[gf];B[if]C[[EV\] This clearly turned out badly for W.  B could just play safely from here and win without more fighting.]
;W[ie];B[je]C[[EV\] B should simply atari at L14, instead of starting another dangerous ko.  Losing this ko lets W back in the game.  No further comments.]

(;B[hf];W[ii];B[gi]C[[EV\] B could give way a little to lock up the left side.  Not sure if this is better than the game though.]

(;W[er];B[ho];W[em];B[dl];W[hm]C[[EV\] W has to push once more, giving B more territory, but then he gets to attack on a large scale, preventing B from making a small sacrifice.]
