C[nekkets [9k\]: hi
crazyd - Hi.  I will try to review this game.  Wish me luck.]
;B[qp];W[dp]C[lkjpoi [9k\]: hi];B[pc];W[dd];B[hp]C[I wonder how to answer this move. It looks weird.
crazyd - there seem to be two styles: build your own stuff or try to spoil your opponent's stuff.  Both are valid.]
;W[fq]C[come to think about it, I would probably be better off if I play C6?]
;B[mq];W[qj]C[I wouldn't want to let him get R10 or Q10.];B[qf]
;W[qm];B[hq]C[Is this move good for black?
crazyd - Black seems to be playing for territory and it looks like if white does the same with C5 or something like it then Black is ahead.  It looks like a fast, large-scale move like K16 might be good now for White.]
;W[op]C[Is this a good way to invade ? And is this a good time?
I thought of building moyo, that's why I played this.];B[pp]
C[crazyd - I don't like this "touching weak stone" (tsuke) move.]
;W[oo];B[oq];W[pn];B[np]C[crazyd - did White gain here?  I think not.  Did Black secure territory?  Yes.]
;W[jd]C[I think it would be trouble too, if black get K16.]
;B[gd];W[ec]C[crazyd - maybe N17 instead?];B[jc]C[I really don't know how to answer this.]
;W[kc];B[ic];W[ld];B[ff];W[df];B[dg];W[cg];B[eg];W[nc]C[crazyd - I think C12 is bigger than it looks, but White seems okay.]
;B[ch];W[cl]C[I saw his moyo getting bigger. So I try to reduce it.]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[bg];W[bf]C[Maybe this is not necessary?];B[cg]
;W[qh]C[To attack.];B[of];W[nh];B[mf];W[ob];B[pb];W[el];B[oj]
C[I didn't know how to respond. Should I kill? Probably.];W[nj]
C[crazyd - If you want to kill (which seems a little unreasonable here) don't tsuke!  Opponent gets stronger.  Contact is for defense - attack at a distance seems to be the lesson for White to learn from this game.]
;B[nk];W[oi];B[mj];W[pj];B[ok]C[But I failed to kill :(];W[lo]
;B[mm];W[jp];B[io]C[crazyd - seems like Black passed this turn - similar to White - both like to contact other person's stones at wrong times.]
;W[lm]C[crazyd - simple connection at O5 maybe?];B[mn];W[mo]
;B[no];W[lq];B[jm];W[mr];B[nr];W[mp];B[nq];W[kr];B[ms];W[lr]
;B[ln];W[ko];B[kn];W[ir];B[ni];W[oh];B[mh];W[jg];B[id];W[je]
;B[kh];W[hm];B[im];W[gr];B[jh];W[hj]C[I thought H10 would be a good invade point. But it gave me lots of trouble later on.
crazyd - not an invasion by my understanding of the term, reduction maybe.  Perhaps getting with a stronger player to review examples of what is attack move versus defense move and what is invasion versus reduction would help clarify your thinking.  Knowing which is which will help you pick moves better.]
;B[hl];W[gl];B[gm];W[hk]C[and no];B[il];W[jj]C[Greedy me.];B[gk]
C[Now the trouble begins.];W[fl];B[fj];W[ih];B[ig];W[hg];B[if]
;W[hi]C[crazyd - isn't White's H10 group enclosed and eyeless?]
;B[ei];W[gj];B[fk];W[fi];B[fh];W[gh];B[ej]C[crazyd - usually take ko first is better.]
;W[hf];B[ie];W[gg];B[fg]C[Black probably can kill me if he J11 or K11.]
;W[ji];B[jf];W[gi];B[gn]C[I];W[kf]C[Another stupid move.];B[ke]
;W[le];B[kd];W[kb];B[lf]C[now i think upper white is  in trouble.]
;W[nd]C[crazyd - Enclosed?  Make two eyes (N18) safer.];B[fc]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[mb];B[bd];W[cc];B[be];W[bc];B[eb];W[db];B[fa]
;W[ed];B[ba];W[da];B[bb];W[ad];B[af];W[cd];B[dn];W[cn];B[dm]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[pd];B[qd];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf];B[qg]

;W[rh];B[rn];W[rm];B[ro];W[kk];B[kl];W[lk];B[ll];W[li];B[mi]
;W[rq];B[qq];W[qr];B[pr];W[rp];B[qo];W[rs];B[sr];W[os];B[ps]
;W[ls];B[ns];W[nn];B[nm]C[There's lot of small yose in this game. My head was almost spinning.]
;W[on];B[qs]C[crazyd - S2 looks better than R1.  I always hear strong players say weak players fight too much (that is, when there is no reward or even when they damage themselves).  This game was like that for both sides.  Or as a 6-dan said about my game with him, with a big smile on his face, "You like complications, don't you?"  Because I am trying to be sensitive to that fault in my games, I think I notcied a lot of it for both sides in this game.  My impression from seeing just this one game is that having a more clear idea of the issues (invade/reduce and attack/defend) would improve both players faster than learning new joseki or new tactics.
