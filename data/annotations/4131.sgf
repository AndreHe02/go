AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Reviewier: thanks very much for doing this review. I really learn from GTL reviews and hope to become strong enough to be a reviewer eventually. In this game, I allow black to build a large territory on the right hand side and I'm not sure when I should have tried to do something about it. When I eventually do try, I think it's probably already too late.

narodniq [25k\]: hi...

Hi, my name is Tim Kington - I'm MatCauthon on KGS.  I'm about 9k, but I haven't played online much lately, so I might be a bit stronger.  I'll mark my comments with a *.]
;W[jp]C[glyn [21k?\]: hi

* I think this is a little passive for a handicap game.  You want to make things interesting right from the beginning.  This doesn't put pressure on Black.]
;B[pl]
(;W[gp]C[* This is solid, but much too slow for this stage of the game.  See variations.]
;B[er];W[dm]LB[cn:a][bp:b]C[* Good, but A is a lot more irritating to Black.  It has a nice follow-up at B, so he can't really ignore A.]
;B[cn];W[cm]C[* This gives Black a big corner too easily, as you can see.]
;B[dn];W[di]C[* Nice.];B[cg];W[ci]C[Is this inefficient?

* Yes.  You can't afford to play this slowly at this stage of the game.  Your stones were already solidly connected, and this isn't the time to worry about territory.  You need to start establishing yourself in a new area.]
;B[ic]
(;W[nd];B[pf]C[Would white 13 at Q14 have been better for white?

* I would prefer it, yes - it may be difficult to get into the right side if you play this way.  See variation.]
;W[oc]LB[pc:a]C[* This is much better at A.];B[pc];W[kc];B[if]
LB[qh:a][cc:b]C[Not sure how to respond here. I want a stable base and to run into the centre, but not sure what my best options are. This already feels a bit squeezed.

* I understand your concern, but if you run now, Black will get moves that make the right side solid territory.  Your group isn't in too much trouble, so you should tenuki (play elsewhere).  I would probably play at A.  You also have to be careful not to let the upper left corner become territory, so you might want to invade there right now.  You should be able to at least get a ko if you start at B.]
;W[jd]C[* VERY bad.  This doesn't help your group that much, and makes Black's area to the left MUCH stronger.]
;B[id];W[je];B[lq];W[ie]C[Couldn't resist this, but should I have responded to M3? Where would you say are the key points for me to play at this point? For instance, I'm never sure whether it is worth invading a corner as this always builds a strong wall for black facing the centre.

* I would much rather deal with a wall facing the center when I'm playing someone weaker than have to deal with solid corner territory.  It's hard for weaker players to make use of their walls.

This move is okay.  You need to create some weaknesses in the upper left or you're going to be in real trouble.]
;B[he];W[kq]C[* Again, this is too small-scale.  When you answer all of Black's moves like this, you let him take over large portions of the board.  Your two stones won't get territory if you ignore this move, but they're not in that much danger.  You MUST not respond here.  You should invade either the upper left or the right side.]
;B[lo];W[jn]LB[lp:a];B[kl];W[kg]LB[qh:a][nf:b]C[* This is a slack move.  It's not doing much of anything useful.

A would be MUCH better, and if you're going with the idea of expanding from your existing group, then B is still a lot better than this move.  You really need to get into the lower right and upper left.  A good way to get into the lower right is to make it look like you're attacking the upper right corner, and then after your group is safe, launch an attack below.]
;B[ig];W[gi];B[ji];W[ij];B[jj];W[ik];B[jk];W[en];B[eo];W[fn]
C[* This whole sequence is off the mark.  If you just complete your borders like this, Black has an overwhelming victory.]
;B[mh]C[* Black wakes up and realizes where the big points are.]

(;W[mf]C[* You don't need this.  You MUST invade the right side immediately.  See variation.]
;B[ng];W[nf];B[og]LB[qh:a][ql:b]C[The right hand side is *starting* to look difficult to invade. Should I have invaded the corner simply to reduce black's territory?

* No, invading the corner would have been a mistake.  The upper left might be good to invade, but you don't want to invade the lower right.  What you needed to do is ignore the last few moves Black made and invade the right side.  A and B would both have been good places to start.  They still are.]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[ad];B[cb];W[bb]C[* Oops, you're dead.]

(;B[af];W[db];B[eb];W[da]LB[ca:a][ea:b]C[* It's better to play at A - here you're giving Black a free move at B.]

;B[df];W[ec];B[ed];W[fc];B[gc];W[fd]C[* Now things are going your way.  In handicap games against a weaker player, you want to fight as much as possible - it keeps Black from playing elsewhere, and he will lose nearly every fight.  Up to this point, Black has been creaming you because you aren't drawing him into fights, and you've let him do pretty much whatever he wanted.  Now he's getting into trouble.  If you can invade that right side, you have a chance.

This is an excellent move, by the way.];B[gd]C[Whoops on black's part.]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[gb]C[* Too small for now.  Invade the right side.  Black can't save those stones anyway.]

(;W[ps]C[Would S4 have been better to make the corner larger? I find it hard to tell whether my corner is safe.

* Yes.  This lets your group die.  You must play S4.];B[rq]

LB[ql:a][qj:b][qi:c][qh:d]C[This attempt to invade didn't work. Are there any general principles that apply to invasions? Where would have been better?

* At this point, you've made Black so strong by playing moves on the outside that you probably can't invade and live if Black plays correctly.  Still, the best points are marked.  You just have to play one, and hope for a mistake.  You can't win without invading.

The main thing is to invade MUCH earlier in the game.

Also, this isn't an invasion.  If you want to invade, don't play up against a wall like this.  The strength of the wall will easily overwhelm your stones.]

* You played pretty well for most of the game, but you weren't aggressive enough to win a four-stone game.  In a handicap game against a weaker player, you want to make things complicated, because you'll be able to handle the compications much better than your opponent.  In this game you played almost the opposite - you kept things simple, except for the invasion in the upper left.

The other major problem was that waited WAY too long to think about invading the right side.  You need to keep an eye on the global situation throughout the entire game, and be aware of when areas are getting close to becoming territory.
