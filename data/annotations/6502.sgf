C[Hello, This is a game between me and my brother. In this game, Black was pushed around a lot, and it seemed to happen without even realizing it. I was wondering if you could point out some things that Black could have done instead. White is about 3k, Black is around 9k or 10k. Keep in mind, I am looking for places where Black was pushed around, and ways to prevent it from happening in the future. Thank You.


I have left comments during the game to focus in on things that I want looked at in particular.


Ok. I have reviewed this, and put some comments and variations. I put my main points at the end.

Because the game was not very long, there is not much to say, but I think you have some answers. If something is still unclear or incomplete, don't hesitate to come back to me.]

  W B
  -- P17
  O17 Q17
  N16 R14
  J17
But, White did not play out this sequence, instead he started the avalanche joseki, which I do not know how to deal with well.



Ok, the reason white played this sequence is because of Q5 stone.
Of course white is not going to 

If you wanted to prevent this, you could have played at R13 or Q14 (see variations next move).]

MA[cn][fq]C[This is too slow.
You want to play large moves, like C6, or come from the other side at F3.

I would not get on the right side now, it seems to me too early, because it will settle the fuseki too quickly.]

This is a bad idea from white.

I would cover from top (see variation)]

does not look good either.

See a poosible variation with this follow up. It's not so bad.]
;W[hr];B[eq];W[dq];B[dr];W[es];B[ds];W[fq];B[gq];W[eq]C[Black resigns here because I cannot see any way back into the game after this. Besides the one reading mistake though, I did not make any obvious mistakes, but still I am pushed around completely. This is why I would like help. Thank you again.



Ok. At this stage, white is leading because of black mistake.
On the other hand, I don't think you played so badly. You just made some moves that white could take advantage of, but i did not see white 'push black around' so much.

The main points I would notice are :

- play big moves in the fuseki (corners, then corners enclosures, then big extensions on your sides. If none, get into your opponent side - see move # 15)

- don't leave cutting points when you are under pressure.
If you can play solidly, you will be able to attack in confidence at later stage.

Hope this helped.
