AB[pd][dp][pp]C[X: Hi, I will put my comments with "X:" preceding it. I am Steve, or "Xue" (hence the X), roughly 3 kyu.

Comments: Alright, I'll leave it at this for now, and send it to you. There are a couple of comments that I didn't understand, so this way you get the first feedback and can ask again, just email me at lifesayko@gmail.com (preferably send the .sgf again).

In general: My impression is you should pay more attention to the direction of play. Sometimes the moves are good locally, but don't fit with the big picture. Sometimes it seems you're too concerned with a particular part, but then it creates difficult situations somewhere else on the board, which makes a chain-reaction of difficult situations.]

wasn't so sure which move he meant maybe the cap was wrong?

X: Ok, not too bad at this point. But pay attention to the direction of play. Black now is very much behind on territory. (And bottom left corner is ignored by both players, I don't understand this >__<, worth so much, costs only 1 move for either side.)

Black does however have 2 huge walls. The key to winning here isn't "I have to kill something big", but to materialize these walls or "moyos" into territory in the center and top.]

;B[ke];W[kf];B[lf]C[this was too tempting

X: But black just rebuilt a wall again, 2 lines inside....without starting on an opposite wall. Black needs to attack the two white stones in the top left, be aggressive, so that you can plant down a couple of "netting" stones.]

(;B[kn]C[X: Keep groups split up. Left gropu is strong now, but not yet completely alive. If it connects, it becomes easy for white to escape into the center with everything. Also, the middle black group is still somewhat weak. If it gets closed in, then it's strength becomes useless and weak, so breaking out into the center is important.]
))
(;B[oq];W[np]C[X: Same shape again, however because of black's presence in the lower center, white's "influence" is useless, and the white group becomes heavy and adrift.]

(;B[hp]C[X: This shape is nice for black. Black gets a strong shape with plenty of influence, which work nicely as a moyo with the bottom right corner.]

(;B[go]C[X: Divide and conquer. If you don't like getting cuts, a more solid jump is also ok, but black shouldn't push white to connect, that's what white wants!]
))
(;B[hq]C[X: If black wants to attack the white stone, then black should push it towards it's strength. remember "Play away from strength", valid both for your own strength and the opponent's.]

(;B[eq]
(;W[fp];B[jp]C[X: If you like the large corner, why not this? White would probably make a one-space jump at the square to try and be lighter, but black in anycase takes a large corner, while still attacking the white stones.]
