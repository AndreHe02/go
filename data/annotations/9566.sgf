C[(DrK: Dear Ted, I will be your reviewer for this game. I note in your instructions that I am to focus mainly on Black's play.

Before I begin, I note that to this day, I find this page helpful in relation to how to evaluate a move in any given game: http://senseis.xmp.net/?StrategyForBeginners4Questions

Please read this before you begin and have it in mind when you look at your moves.

I usually try to find 2-3 things specific that I think you can work on, as well as making pointers to things I think you should pay attention to.

All comments are in brackets.

If I miss something or if you have any questions in relation to this review, please email drk.derek@gmail.com.

Cheers

-DrK)];B[qd];W[ed]C[I've never seen this move before -- I'm not sure how to react

(DrK: In the beginning try to stake territory take area that takes as few stones to control (corner) before doing anything else.

White's move is very loose - in other words it does not really control the corner. The obvious starting point is if white does not wish to control the corner you can down the track.)]
;B[pq];W[dq]
(;B[dc]C[I was thinking, "it looks like his move left a lot of space in the corner; maybe I can grab it!"

(DrK: Good thinking. Not so good in execution. C16 or c17 stakes your claim at the corner better. See variations).]
;W[de];B[cd];W[po]
(;B[nq]C[I was thinking, "I don't want him to play O3 and trap me in the corner"

(DrK: Good thinking. If at all possible try to stake as many safe bases on the board that cannot be killed and not be shut in. However, frequently if you have a stone on the 3rd line (counting from the edge of the board) the next move ideally should be on the 4th line. This concept is called "balance". So O4, R5 or even P5 is better here. See variations).]
;W[ce];B[ec]C[(DrK: Good. Don't let white shut you in. Try to push from at least one side if possible).]
;W[od]
(;B[pc]C[(DrK: This is too timid. Try to push further. Try to not only control corner but also have influence at the side. See variations).]
;W[pf]
(;B[gd]C[I was thinking, "hmm, I don't want him to grab the whole top side -- maybe I can make a bid for it". in retrospect, I think this was a bad move

(DrK: I like this move. Your thinking is right. You need to develop the skill to see what the opponent can play next and prepare for countermoves.

However, I would question if this is the right time to play this move. See variations).]
;W[fc];B[fd];W[gc];B[hc];W[hb]
(;B[id]C[(DrK: I don't like this move. White at h18 is struggling to live by crawling on the 2nd line. Depending on what you want to do you can take advantage here. See variations).]
;W[ib]
(;B[fq]C[(DrK: Generally, if you want to approach a stone in a corner, you approach from the opposite side of a corner. Unless you have a special reason. In here, white's strong on the left side. You should approach on the left side to weaken its influence. See variations).]
;W[oc];B[ob]C[I think this move was bad -- again, I was trying to be active on the top side of the board. seems like he easily defended, and I wasted a move

(DrK: Not bad per se. It is small. There are bigger things on the board that pushing here right now. But when all big points are taken then you may play here.)]
;W[nb];B[pb];W[do]C[(DrK: White has not "defended". This can be attacked at the right moment - when all the other big points have been taken. Just to show why this is not safe yet I will play at top right corner. Also, white plays D5 to ensure there is no ladder opportunity at O17.)]

(;B[qf];W[qg];B[pe];W[rf]
(;B[qe]C[(DrK: just because opponent atari you does not mean you have to connect. See variation.)]
;W[og];B[of];W[pg];B[oe];W[mc];B[me];W[ld];B[le];W[kd]
(;B[mf]C[I was worried about being cut at O15

(DrK: It is always a good idea to carefully examine if your groups can be cut. However, in this situation you wasted a move. See variations).]
;W[je]C[I was hoping I could make a wall across the top. I guess not!

(DrK: You could have. However, you concentrate too much on your top right corner. White is able to strengthen top right before attacking your black stones at G16).]

(;B[pm]C[I was thinking, "Hmm, maybe I can attack that lonely stone at Q5"

(DrK: You can. However, I would argue that first you worry about if you have any weakness. Then examine how you can target opponent's weak stones. Black's G16 and D17 groups both need to be fixed to be alive. See variations).]
;W[no]
(;B[fo]C[I was thinking, "maybe I can form territory on the bottom side"

(DrK: Fix up bottom right corner first ... White is threatening to box black in there...)]
;W[dm]
(;B[lo]C[I was thinking, "maybe I can block him off." immediately after I moved, I realized he could just play N4.

(DrK: Well yes. Frequently knight's move is sufficient. See variations).]
;W[mp];B[lp];W[mq];B[nr];W[lq];B[kq];W[kr];B[jr]C[(DrK: Frequently you have to take great care it is okay to hana twice because it is easy to be cut. In this situation it is actually a good move if you know how to follow up.)]
;W[jq];B[kp];W[ir]
(;B[pi]C[I was thinking, "maybe I can make territory along the side here, as well as attack the group at Q13"

(DrK: M2 is the key move here. See variation).

(DrK: Also, if you wish to attack group at Q13, you should make sure your attack does not leave yourself with a weakness that can be attacked. Black's stone here is too close leaving the risk it can be disconnected at Q9. If you want to attack black should play at Q10 at most. See variation.)]
;W[nh]C[(DrK: white runs to centre while aiming at the weakness at Q9. Black has to protect its connections.)]
;B[ni];W[mh]
(;B[lg]C[(DrK: Don't just attack for the sake of it. Black should try to both attack and fix up it's weaknesses in stones. See variation.)]

(;B[nm]C[(DrK: O8 is not important. No point to cut. Black should try to make it's group live and connect if possible. See variation.)]
;W[mm];B[om];W[mn];B[ml];W[km]
(;B[ll]C[I think this was a bad move, but I'm not sure what I should've done instead

(DrK: Examine the board at the moment. Ask yourself:

1. Do you have any weak black groups on the board? Yes. M5 group, F5 group, D17 group and G16 group are not yet alive.
2. Are there any weak white groups on the board? Yes. D15 group.

Your first order of business should be to fix up your weak group and try to attack white's weak group. See variation.)]
;W[kn]
(;B[jo]C[(DrK: There is a time and please for kosumi. In here solid connection is much better. See variation.)]
;W[im];B[fm];W[dk];B[ee];W[dd];B[ef];W[bd];B[cc];W[cg];B[bc]
;W[be];B[iq];W[js];B[jp];W[hq];B[jr];W[gr]
(;B[jq]C[(DrK: If you wish to connect, k3 is not the right move. See variation.)]
;W[hp];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[ho]C[only now do I realize that my group at K3 is dead. I resigned here. thanks for reviewing!

(DrK: K5 was never yet alive during this game. At the end of the day you have to consciously fix and make a group live.)

(DrK: Conclusion - I suggest you do the following:

1. Try to play more games against players who are several stones stronger. You have to learn to play and be used to be surprised. If you wish to continue to play go you must overcome any fear or losing, or encountering pincer or surprise.
2. Constantly assess on the board - do you have any weak group that is in danger? If so without good reason not to you should go fix.
3. Try to link up your groups of stones as much as possible. Notice white's stones are quite connected especially on the left side. Whereas your black stones are fragmented. Linked stones are much easier to keep alive.

You had the right thinking though so I would argue that you should keep practicing and develop your perception and depth in the game. Don't be too hard on yourself in this game you played your level.

If you are interested I play on online go too (but slow games only I don't have time to play live games) I am happy to play you. Just send invite. 

Cheers
