C[Hi, I'm Bart, around 7 kyu on kgs and I'll try to do the review as requested, for both sides.
As I'm not a dan player (far from it) I can only give some comments that I hope make sense and steer you in the right direction.

My comments start with B:];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[Black goes for the chinese opening.

There is a nice video on this opening, which might be interesting to watch for both black and white:
http://eurogotv.com/index.php?menu=Video&log=speelaf&id=1uoClJBOGyA]
;W[qg];B[qe]C[is it a good move?

B: yes, because it defends the corner and attacks the white stone at the same time. White can only make a small base here and is under pressure.]
;W[qj]C[B: this is a bit too far (see video mentioned earlier).]
;B[pj];W[rj];B[rk];W[pi];B[oj];W[oi]
(;B[rg]C[B: for black: it's possible to take away more of the base, see variation.
B: for white: you can also go out to the center, see variation.]
(;W[rh];B[rf];W[pg];B[ni]C[B: now black gets to play here first.]
;W[nh];B[nj]
(;W[jd]LB[nc:C][dj:A][mp:B]C[B: This move is a bit far from the other white stones. I think it's better for white to reinforce the left side (A), or to attack the bottom (B) or top (C).]
;B[lc]LB[nc:A]C[B: correct respons I think. N17 might be a bit safer.
What happens if white plays at A?]
(;W[jc];B[fd]LB[nc:A][nd:B]C[what do you thinks about this move?

B: I think it is possible for white to play at A or B.]
(;W[gc]C[B: same as on the right side. It's a bit too close to black's stone to make a base...]
;B[fc]C[B: ...and you make black stronger.];W[gd]C[B: and now white makes black even stronger.]
;B[fe];W[ld]LB[nc:A][nd:B]C[B: good idea to attack here. But I think it's better to try and split the black stones first with A or B.]
;B[md];W[le];B[me];W[lg]C[B: to connect is a good idea.];B[og]
;W[oh];B[mg];W[mh];B[lf];W[kf];B[mf];W[kh];B[li];W[lh];B[ki]
(;W[jh]C[B: K11 attacks black a bit better.];B[df];W[ce];B[cf]
(;W[bf]C[B: I like C17 a little more.];B[bg];W[af];B[ag];W[bd]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[fb];W[cb];B[hb]
(;W[hc]C[B: did white think about G18?
See variation.];B[ib]
(;W[ic]C[B: again, why not see if white can block at K18?];B[jb]
;W[kc];B[lb];W[kb]CR[ka]LB[gf:A][ii:B]C[B: black will still connect at L19, So better play A or B.]
;B[ka];W[ge]C[B: you are now one stone behind, usually not good.]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[jf];W[je];B[hg];W[gg];B[ff];W[ig];B[hh];W[ih]
;B[gh]
(;W[ii]TR[ih][jh]C[B: if you have two stones like this, you can jump one out. Black cannot cut; see variations.
It's faster than J11.];B[dn]C[B: good]
(;W[ck]C[how to attack thois stone?

B: that's difficult. Black is strong, so he can push you towards his wall (as he did correctly in the game). C12 first might be good, see variation.]
;B[cl];W[bl];B[bk];W[cm];B[dl];W[bm];B[bj];W[cn];B[dm];W[do]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[ip]LB[qb:A][di:B][qo:C]C[B: difficult for white to respond. Black now has big areas A, B and C.]
(;W[lq]C[B: playing around here makes the most sense.
What about O4 first? See variations.]
(;B[kq];W[kp]SQ[ik][jl][kn]C[B: if you play on top, it's usually to reduce (squares) and give up the stone at M3.
Or to make life at the bottom.];B[lp]
(;W[kr]C[B: with L4, K4 is a better move, I think. See variation.]
;B[jq];W[mq];B[mp];W[jr];B[ko];W[nq];B[np];W[oq];B[op]C[B: white had a small group and black has a big area. Very good for black.]
(;W[pp]C[B: cut doesnt work; better to make life on the left side, I think.]
;B[po]
(;W[qp]C[B: that doesnt work, I'm afraid.];B[qq];W[qo];B[qn]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[sq];B[ro];W[rp];B[sr];W[pr];B[qr];W[ps];B[qs]
;W[nr];B[lr];W[iq];B[jp];W[hq];B[hp];W[gq];B[gp];W[fq];B[fp]
;W[ep]
(;B[er]C[B: E5 is possible, I think.];W[en]C[B: good for white. E2 was better used at E5.]
;B[dk];W[fn];B[jk]LB[gk:A][nm:B]C[B: good. If white reduces A, take territory B.]
;W[ik]C[B: probably better to play a bit further from that stone, at H10, for example.]
;B[il];W[hk];B[jj]
(;W[ij]C[B: H11 is better shape.];B[hl]
(;W[gk]LB[fn:A]C[B: because you have stone A, you can jump to F9.]
;B[fj];W[de]C[B: not sure what this move does.];B[cj]C[B: so I don't see why black should respond.]
;W[cg];B[bh]
(;W[dg]C[B: C13 stone is lost. Better use it as a sacrifice to get into blacks territory.See variation.]
;B[ef];W[fg];B[fh];W[eg];B[ch];W[fk]
(;B[gj]C[B: I like E9 a little better.];W[ng];B[of];W[nf];B[ne]
;W[oe];B[od]
(;W[pf]C[B: white missed a chance there. N17 is trouble for black. See variation.]
;B[nc];W[qc]C[B: very hard to live in the corner now.];B[qd]
;W[pc]C[B: S17 or S18 might make a ko in the corner to live.]
;B[rc];W[rb];B[sd];W[sb];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc];B[nb]C[B: good, solid defence by black.]
;W[gn];B[ns];W[ms]C[aljne26 [13k\]: just miss click

[pp][qp][rp][sp][rq][sq][rs][ss]C[B: you both played a good game. There where a few chances white missed. White has more of a fighting spirit, but black made good use of his territory potential.
Hopefully my remarks made some sense and help you improve your game. Have fun!]
