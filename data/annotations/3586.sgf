C[Is it better to play D18, white C17, then black J16 ?  Or something different ?

Sirkut> No, your moves a pretty good.  Pushing any farther
into the corner would start a fight needlessly and too early.
Two notes for improvement: J17 is stronger than your j16.
Also, try not to become so concentrated on one side of the board.]
;W[db];B[qh]SQ[qf]C[Sirkut> This move is good; It is senti because it forces W R7.  However it does leave a weakness at R14 if W builds up any strength around it later.  R13 ('A') may have been a better option, but you may have not kept sente.]
;W[qm];B[oh]C[Sirkut>  Too early, especially true if you had played R13 instead of R12.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[Sirkut> Not a good move.  It begs W to respond with F4 giving him a very strong shape.  Look at the variations on this move, they are both common joseki.]
;W[fp]
(;B[kq]C[Here, I didn't want white to secure a wing formation.  Is this the best point, or would
something else have been better ?

Sirkut> This is a good idea, but you'll be giving up senti.  After this exchange W is in a great position to attack your weak corner group. I think I would have played on the left side, strengthening the corner group before trying an invasion like this.  You don't want to be in the position of trying to defend two weak groups at once.  You'll probably still have opportunities to invade later. See the variation on this move.]
;W[iq];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[nr];B[mr];W[or]SQ[lo][kp]C[Not quite sure what's best here.  I feared N3.

Sirkut> Not much to fear really as long as you start pushing 
into the center to get something for you effort either way.  The marked positions would also protect against N3. 'A' is nice because it also attacks W's left group. These are all ladder breakers; That's what would be created if W played N3.  I demonstrate that in the variation.  I also include one variation that ignores the threat all together.]

(;B[kr];W[io];B[ld]C[Trying to secure upper right.

Sirkut> Too early.  You're already really strong there, while there's big unclaimed territory on the left and you're not putting your bottom group to much use.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[gc];B[ic];W[fb];B[gd];W[ec];B[cm]SQ[dp][eq]C[Here, is it better to expand corner like this,
or to open up center with e.g. O10 or s.t. ?

Sirkut> Definately expand the corner first.  It's always much easier to get territory in the corner and along the edges than in the center.  D6, or D7, may have been better though because they have a stronger connection to the marked stones which are weak.]
;W[ck]
(;B[ci]C[I guess I wanted to do something with the upper
left corner of white here.  This didn't work in
the end.  Is it a good idea to go for black B14,
white B15, ..., or better to do a one-point jump
to E11, or else ?

Sirkut> This didn't work because W is pretty strong on both sides of your invasion.  B14 wouldn't help because unless W is very paranoid he will play B13, not B15.  Either way it won't be easy.  It's also a little late to try any risky invasions.  C9 is weak though and you'd gain a lot by pushing it around instead.  See the variation.]
;W[ek];B[em];W[gk];B[oj];W[ok];B[pj];W[pk];B[nj];W[bl];B[bm]
;W[fi]SQ[ff][fg]C[Am I being too cautious here ?  Better to push
down withe.g. E15, etc, and THEN secure the
center ?

Sirkut> E15 would be a little risky, the marked spots would be a little safer.  But I like the sequence you played.]

;B[jk]C[Sirkut> Very nice sequence!  You quickly reduced W's potential and got as much territory as you could have hoped for!]
;W[cq]C[How do I answer this here ?  Should I have
secured my corner better, sooner, by playing
something like F2 or E2 ?

Sirkut> I think you had the best option.  The weakness of the two marked stones means W will be able to connect to his group on the outside, or make life in the corner, no matter what you do now.]

Is there anything I can do with either the
upper left or lower right at this stage ?

Sirkut> My earlier comments about the ladder breaker still apply here.  This move is necessary, but could have been replaced by one of the other ladder breakers, like to two marked spots.]

[ls]C[Sirkut> Thank you for submitting this game for review.  I enjoyed looking it over.  You played well.

Here are some tips to keep in mind when playing or reviewing your games:

1) This simpler move is ofter stronger, and therefor better.
2) Invade only when you have good reinforcements to run to; otherwise reduce.
3) Worry a little more about keeping your territory strong rather than extending as far and as early as you can.  You don't want  to waste time by defending later or giving your opponent more opportunities to control the game.

I hope you found this review helpful.  I suggest that you play around with variations and try out some of the ideas here, while you're not playing a game.  Feel free to email me at sirkut001@yahoo.com withatj any questions you have.]
