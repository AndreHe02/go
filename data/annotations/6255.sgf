C[I am black. the game was blayed in the german league, with 1h time for each.

Comments by Az];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[pj];W[ck];B[fc];W[df]
TR[pj][jd]C[Az: I would prefer to followup with K16 as you suggest, it works better with your stone at Q10. I'm not 100% sure that the slide is wrong, but it doesn't look right to me.]

(;B[db]C[slide already bad?];W[nq]
(;B[pn]TR[dq]C[Az: If you are going to pincer, then a high pincer might work better since his stone is low and you don't want white to press down on you to build influence. Q6 is a bit passive and can still be invaded.]
;W[jp]TR[kp][pl]C[Az: In this position W should play closer since he is strong on the left side and wants to invade around Q8 later]
;B[cc]TR[do]C[Az: Definetly a mistake. Black is playing an influence game, all this does is take a few points in gote. Your group is already strong. D5 is the biggest place on the board, B should try to make light shape before W can enclose the corner.]
;W[do]C[Az: Right! Now things looks promising for white.];B[nd]
TR[md]C[Az: Unusual shape, but hard to see a better move locally. Since none of this is going to be terroritory anyway (you expect W to invade, right?), the nikken tobi to N16 might be playable too.]
;W[lc];B[ic]TR[jc]C[Az: Soft. K17 is the least black should do, your group on the left is very strong so you can play further away.]
;W[le]TR[cp]C[Az: The cap is a bit early, I would consider the probe in the corner, see variations]

(;B[ek];W[el];B[fl];W[dl]LB[fi:A][di:B][fn:C][eq:D]C[Az: Connecting is heavy for sure. F11 would make lighter shape, with followup at D11 to punish W for leaving his 2 stones. If you can get D11 W will have two weak groups and really be hurting. So it's safe to assume he will answer around 'B' and you get 'C'.

Another option after the 'A'-'B' exchange would be to attach at 'D']
;B[fk];W[hd];B[hc]TR[id]C[Az: Oh no! If you play here W gets much closer to linking up his groups, B should push and cut]
;W[fd]C[Az: Very painful for black];B[gd];W[ge];B[gc];W[cd]

(;B[cp]MA[dl][el]C[Az: This probe works better if W doesn't already have these stones. Now he just answers at C3 and that's the end of it. Locally, the move to think about now is E3...]
;W[cq]
(;B[fp]C[I thought w must answer d4, but I was wrong...
b needs another move then, but which?

Az: The problem is that the probe came too late. Better to reduce now...]

;W[im]C[bad result from the first fight for b I guess

Az: Definetly, W built wonderful influence and black got very little.]
;B[ik];W[ii];B[jj];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[qc];B[rf];W[ob]
TR[mo]C[Az: N5 is the key point now, on the boundry between two moyos. Enclosing the corner is big, but not the main issue.]
;B[pq];W[ql]C[two questions:
1. How bad is b position at that point?
2. What should I do ???

Az: Blacks position is difficult, but not hopeless. For sure black must attack, if W can destroy this terroritory without paying a significant price the games over for sure. The weakness of the blalck group in the center doesn't help, but first you need to take his base, see variation]

(;B[pl]C[bad, I guess now

Az: This way white lives inside and black builds influence towards nothing. Should be a won game for W now]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[qj];B[qi];W[qk];B[ri];W[qo];B[po];W[rp];B[rq]
;W[rj];B[lq]C[Az: Not big enough, there is no way to effectively use the wall.]
;W[lp];B[kq];W[jq];B[kp];W[ko];B[mp];W[lo];B[mq];W[mo]C[Az: W plays the correct response all the way through, black got almost nothing]
;B[np];W[pk];B[ok];W[oj];B[pi];W[nk];B[ol]TR[ei]C[Az: If W just plays E11 he wins by at least 20 points, I don't understand his next move]
;W[kh];B[fi];W[sd]C[and

Az: Small, W should just defend the left side]
(;B[dg]LB[di:A][ch:B]C[and b definitely needs something else here.
I tried to pick a fight because I feeled I was to much behind.

Az: Black is behind a lot, if you play 'a' and he plays 'b' you'll loose by at least 15 points, probably more. This seems as good as anything, since you have to try something. Oh course it's unreasonable, but you're down so you have to.]
