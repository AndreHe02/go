C[Hi, thanks for reviewing my game. I play on KGS, under the username of akimatsu. This was a free game played with me as black, and 0.5 komi for white.

In fact, i felt that the opponent resigned too early in this game. I felt that if he exploited the living group inside my territory, the score might have been closer. He might even have won.

I would like some comments on the my judgement at certain points of the game.

Also, it would be great if you could also tell me if the opponent resigning was a wise action.

Thanks,
Akimatsu

P.S. My comments will start with [Aki\]];B[pd]C[s> hello, I am siegoman ( 11k ), I have reviewed the game, adding comments marked with s>

in reply to your question about when the game ended... I agree with you, he did resign too early, 

consider these moves as points to change:
13 - when surrounded, make more connected plays
23 - big moves early on, get many potentials going.
69 - play away from thickness
71 - push into thickness, sacrifice to make profit.
93 - when extending give some room to connect.
117 - use dead stones to attack

>> details >>

my strongest area is the opening.  this game did not have much of an opening, jumping directly into a heavy fight where you won.

the art of go is creating many parallel battles where the side effect of one has an effect on the outcome of another.

1. setup many initial attacks with potential follow up
2. push one attack that will fail
3. the side effect of that failed attack makes you stronger for a neighboring fight, where you win.
   move 33 on a small scale example, black threatens to take a stone, white responds, and black has a better attacking potential in the other direction.
   move 38 on a small scale example, white threatens something that obviously fails, but he does some forcing moves, preparing for another battle.

I think you will enjoy the game more by having more activities going on.  playing complicated fights early on is kind of a coin toss, hoping for a mistake.  usually the attacker will lose locally.

feel free to contact me with any questions / advice / suggestions.  I am good at some things, and quite weak at others, I also want to learn.

tom.g.coleman@gmail.com];W[pp]LB[dd:B][dp:A]C[s> consider a different opening to build influence
A = move made in game, asking for lots of fighting.
B = move to lean more towards influence.  

After looking at the future moves, and your comments you appear to have a good eye for influence.  Move B seems to fit more with your plaing style.]

(;B[dp];W[dc]LB[ce:A][de:B]C[s> considering the position of D17 and D4...
A = an approaching move, seems reasonable
B = an approaching move that seems to work better with D4]
(;B[ce];W[nc]LB[ic:B][lc:A][ed:D][qf:C]C[s> here are my views on the letters shown.  further comments on the white move that comes after each one.

A: the move made in the game, this pincer does put pressure on O17, however it induces one of two moves, either W O15 = start fighting, or W R17 = black builds a wall for influence.

B: a move that sets up to build a group on the top.

C: defend the Q16 stone, and prepare to extend towards Q4

D: cap off D17 building up a wall to extend towards D4]
(;B[lc]LB[qc:A][ne:B]C[s> in my opinion, all the comments are my opinions... :), anyway, this pincer works well if there is a stone at Q10, or if the D17 stone is black.
For a move in go to have value it needs to threaten at least two things, and not induce something that will cause you to respond.

Here M17 threatens to either extend to M15 or J17.  However white has the reply of O15, which also threatens two things: Q14 and L16.

my point is try to find moves that 
- have multiple follow ups
- do not induce the opponent to run into you

for white:  
A = take corner, give up influence when black builds a wall
when W R17 is played after W O17 then black has to extend three times ( Q17, Q16, Q15 ) so his corner lives more easily.
in this situation I would suggest A for white, because W D17 is there to neutralize the wall that would be formed at Q7 to Q15
B = divide M17 from Q16, continue the pincer idea.
this is also good, because white has the follow up move of W L16, which works well with W D17.]

(;W[ne]LB[ic:B][pf:A]C[[Aki\] I remember reading somewhere that this was not too good of a move for white, and that it would be better to invade the 3-3 point. Is this true? Just wondering. Since i see a lot of players play this move.

s>]
(;B[pf]LB[jc:A][kd:B]C[[Aki\] And this is who i answer it 99% of the time. From here, the first 4-5 moves are often seen in my games.

Is this a good answer? Or is there somewhere better for me to play?

s> Q14 is the common play for black, defending the corner being more common than building in the top area.  however, consider the D17 stone and C15 stone, maybe J17 will fit more what you want to do... are you ok with giving up Q16 and capturing / enclosing D17?  I would be.

focusing now on white's next move:
A ( K17 ): as played in the game this puts pressure on M17, however it induces the move of B M15, which puts pressure on the W O15 group.  considering W Q4 and W D17 this may be the best way to go.  for me it is too risky.  if white gets a large group ( as happened in this game ) then it is too good for him.

B ( L16 ): as I more commonly see it.  L16 works well with O15 and D17, looking to build a white wall facing the center.  white would sacrifice O17 to build out from O15.]

(;W[jc]LB[jc:C][le:B][ng:A]SQ[lc]C[[Aki\] They always play either (A) (B) or (C). I sometimes have trouble chosing whether to help the square stone or not.

Should i or not?

This move here,  i decided to save it. However, i have some more trouble deciding if they play at (A)

s> again, when deciding a move, try to see what it pushes the other guy to do.  most likely saving M17 will cause O15 to feel pressure, so he will extend out again, putting pressure on Q14.

it is likely that Q14 is safe, it can live, it can get two eyes.

so with Q14 safe, and O15 sticking out you have M15 built up, what do you want to do with that?  do you like the idea of spreading over K17 and making a wall to C15?  if yes, then threaten to invade G17 from above, seal him in, and build up influence.

would you prefer to attack O15 and chase him around?  if yes, then maybe you need to build up M17, M15 a bit by threatening / attacking K17, not too heavily, just enough so that if he ignores you then he will regret it.  not so heavily that his reply causes you to also defend again ( such as contact plays will do )

after threatening K17 M17 will be stronger and ready to attack O15.

the side effect of one attack will help for the next.  expect the attacks to fail, but also try to use the side effects to your advantage.]

(;B[le];W[ng]LB[je:A][mf:B][lg:C]
(;B[je]C[s> probably too direct. this is spreading out a little too thin, especially with the O15 column leaning behind you.

if you want to kill K17, then lean into the O15 guys for a while, get stronger from that, then use that strength to fall on K17.

again, the attack on the O15 column will not kill it, it will not be a harsh fight, just enough to have really good follow up moves.

for example black O14 would be a harsh attack with lots of side effects, while black N14 is an attack with a good follow up.  so he has to respond, but it doesn't hurt you.]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[ke];B[kf];W[hd]
(;B[hf]LB[jf:B][lf:A]C[[Aki\] I didn't see the cut at (A). Or rather i was only thinking about how i could gain more influence since my stones are already at a high position.

I intended to also protect the cut at (B). However, i didn's realize that a cut at (A) would be dangerous.]

(;B[kg]C[s> black in the fight that follows black];W[lg]LB[qi:B]

(;B[ic]C[s> all the eggs in one basket... throwing good stones after bad...  let M16 go, it may help later on.]
;W[jd]
(;B[ie]C[s> this does strengthen your platform, and threatens to connect with J17.  but again, such a large area around K4 and D10 and Q8]
;W[id]LB[jb:A][ee:B][jp:E][fq:D][nq:C]C[s> black has several options at this point.
A: attack K16, sacrifice some stones, attempt to rescue M17.
let us consider the value of the three stones near M17:
- cutting K16 from O13.  however, O13 is "out" and likely to live.  H16 has space to make eyes, and is likely to live.
B: threaten the corner and connect with H14, building a wall to lean into D10
C: threaten the Q4 corner, and build into K4
D: strengthen the D4 corner to extend either up to D10 or over to K4
E: stake out the large lower edge, building towards Q4 or D4, white cannot prevent both.]

(;B[jb]C[s> another reason to move at K18 is...
- many stones were invested with M17, we cannot just let it die!  sorry, but in it's current state it is creating some aji, to support future battles, to push up from the other side with its last breath.  if many details are now played out near M17, then the aji or potential is spent, and it has died with no purpose.

let M17 hang in the air, let it push back as it dies.];W[kb]
;B[kc]
(;W[ib];B[lb]C[s> black came out able to reach under O17, and with sente.]

(;W[ja]C[s> white reacts without seeing the larger picture.  In the very short term, this is good for white.  black is happy if white takes.]
;B[nb]LB[ob:A][oc:B]
(;W[ob]C[s> in general contact plays to strengthen both sides, white is helping black.]
;B[oc]LB[mb:A][od:B]C[s> A = attack directly and lose  B = lean against something strong first ( do an attack that is going to fail, but use the side effect ) then attack and win.]

(;W[mb]C[s> white attacks directly, without preparation, and fails.]
;B[nd]C[s> black does an excellent job, sacrificing K18, then O18 to rescue the stones.]
;W[na];B[md]LB[la:A][oe:B]
(;W[la]C[[Aki\] Luckily i was able to escape out of it.

s> black connects out, this fight was due to H14, which did start a moyo around the D10 area.

s> this seems like a pass move by white, maybe he is upset because M17 has lived, so he punishes himself with this move.]
;B[qg]LB[pc:A][oe:B]
(;W[pc]C[s> white forces black to connect directly, pushing black against O15]
;B[od];W[qc];B[qd];W[qh]C[s> good move, lean into the strong group, build up space with Q4]
;B[mi];W[oj]
(;B[qm]LB[oh:A]C[[Aki\] I played this move just to see if i could cut him at (A). This move would make the ladder unfavorable for white.

s> the idea of playing a move to both push against Q4 and also prepare for a cut at P12 is a good way of thinking.  Once the idea comes, then read out the possible moves.  This is especially important after rescuing a big group, or making a big capture.  The elation of a local victory can sometimes cause a loss of reality.
here are some questions I would try to answer by reading it out:
- would a cut at A work for black?
- does R7 have a good followup move, or it black forcing white to get stronger there?]

(;W[pe]C[s> white is generous, forcing black to form an eye.
I think white has given up, or lost interest.];B[oe];W[qe];B[re]
;W[qf]LB[rf:A][oh:B]C[[Aki\] Did i have to take those stones at (A)? I thought i was at a better position here so i didn't take any risks. I don't think it would have been a big threat though. I was considering of cutting at (B).

s>  I take the stones when they may be used against me.  for example W P14, W Q13 and future ko threats.  in this case A is not needed.  but white can use them as leverage.]

(;B[rf];W[qk];B[oi]LB[oh:A][pj:B]
(;W[oh]C[s> excellent example of heavy play.  what good are the O13 stones?  do they cut away a group that does not have two eyes?  do they provide life for a group ( by sharing their eyes )

let O13 die, it is not strategically relevant.];B[ni]LB[pi:A]
[pj:B]
(;W[pi];B[om]C[s> excellent plan to help R7, directly out, no contact, no bad side effects.]
;W[nq];B[jp]LB[mk:B][kq:A]C[s> there is the direct attack, that forces a single reply, and the more subtle attack that can branch in more than one direction.

A ( W L3 ) is the direct attack to get O3 safe and alive, and get some more territory,  however it forces K4 to seal off the G4 area.  is this what white wants?

B ( W N9 ) is the less direct attack, it threatens to kill N11 or P7]

(;W[kq];B[jq];W[cg]LB[ee:A][cj:B]C[s> several options, consider thickness and sacrifice.

A: normally this move in reply to W C13 will cut the side from the corner.  However in this case extending is running into a thick decided area.  many people say to play away from thickness, E15 is close to thickness.  The reason being, you want to get the most potential out of your move.  there are not many possible follow ups for C15...
- black C15 live in the corner while white surrounds and has influence into the large F9 area.
- black C15 connects to H14 while C13 grows into the empty space.
- black C15 captures C13

B: this move has more potential, and that's what you want from am ove.
- plays away from thickness, 
- works with C4, K4 and L12 to build a moyo.
- puts pressure on C13]
