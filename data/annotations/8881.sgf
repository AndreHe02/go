AB[dd][pd][dp]C[*saitann*: Hi! 

-- Hello, my my name is Sven and IÂ´m about 7 kyu at Dragon Go Server .
My comments are all preceded by "--" and I hope they will provide a little bit of help to you.

-- The main potential for Black to improve ist to not get involved into small area fights at the beginnung. Instead, remember to stick to the rule "first the corner, then the edges, then the center", since it is far more difficult to get points in the center, where you have to build four walls around your territory. This implies that you should switch from local fights where only few point can be gained, to elsewhere on board, where there is a lot of free space left. Have a look at the board after the first 50 moves - there are plenty of stones at the left, while the center and the right side are quite deserted!

Also you should keep in mind, that the third line from the edge is for claiming territory, while the forth line aims at building influence towards the center. When playing even high on the fifth line (see e.g. move 90), you most probably won't be able to get a base for you stones at the edge - play there only when there is the prospect of a huge amount of points in the center or when you can foil your oppenent's building territory while at the same time keeping your stone in contact with one of your living groups.]
