C[I got a bit frustrated in the middle/late  game, so there are a few silly moves, but I would appreciate some comments on the early game.

Thanks!

Not bad, though it makes it too easy for black to link to corner. I prefer the move at N5.]

definitely.];W[fq];B[kp];W[ko]C[the aji here is terrible for white.]

(;W[kn];B[ip]C[it is terrible to let black capture like this.]
;W[jn];B[io]C[it should be clear that F3 was not good.];W[nc]

(;B[mc];W[md];B[nb];W[jd]C[deja vu all over again? L17 is much better.]
;B[kc];W[jc]C[this result is not great for black. He is too low, which is why L16 was better than N17.

but the aji of L16 is very bad for white.];B[cf]C[In this situation, black might be better off splititng the side with C9.]
;W[ch]TR[ip][io][jo]C[I'm not sure this was the best response.

It's ok as long as white keeps his focus on the upper left. Prospects for white on the left side are fairly poor because of the influence of the marked stones.]
;B[fc];W[ec]C[this is getting tricky.];B[fd]C[First, i'd prefer G16 for black.]

(;W[cd]C[but when white plays here...];B[ee]C[the position reverts to this position which favors black.]
;W[eb]TR[dg]C[This is bad. Despite the possible downsides, white MUST play E13 to capture the marked stone.]

;B[eg];W[dh];B[ff]C[Now the game is close to over barring a serious black error.]

d7 is better, but it matters little. White is in deep trouble.]

yes, white has done well here.];B[pd]C[Q18 is much better.]

maybe q7 is better aiming at complications in the lower right.]

;B[fg];W[ml]C[poor play, but I felt like I was too far behind already; probagbly better to secure territory elsewhere?

In a sense. In all honesty, the proper course is to resign. Black is up by at least 15 with prospects for increasing his lead.

In any case, this move does nothing as black can respond simply.]
