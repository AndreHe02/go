AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[David : I played this game against the computer (GnuGo 3.6, on weakest/fastest setting). I have no real idea about my rank, so an estimate is best left to the reviewer...

-----------

Hi! my name is Jeremie and I am 16k on KGS. I'll try my best to answer your questions and offer you some variations for different situations. I tried to focus on the most important ones.

This is my first review on GTL, I hope you will find it useful and am open to any comment or further question you might have.]
;W[cn]LB[cl:E][dn:D][co:C][fp:B][fq:A]C[There are many ways to deal with this move (the star point is very flexible). Most common answers are marked.

A and B are about the same idea, A being more secure but less aggressive than B. They are the most common answers, even in games without handicap.

C is very aggressive, and is only effective because of the high handicap

D is meant to secure territory in the corner for black

The pincer at E almost always leads to white invading the corner and black getting influence in result.

I have included joseki that go with these options.]
(;B[fo]C[David : Since I am but a beginner (started playing go a week ago), I haven't studied Joseki/Fuseki so I just played what seemed "OK".

---

This moves really seems akward. It does put some pressure on the white stone but does not secure the side nor the corner. Fuseki is almost always played on the 3rd and 4th line. With this play, white could for example get a good invasion at C3.]

(;W[fm];B[cl];W[hm];B[jm];W[hk];B[hi];W[bp];B[cq]C[The idea here is good : Black puts a lot of pressure on the white group and gets good influence in return.]
;W[gd]

--- 

Indeed, black is connected already, no need to waste a move on that.]
;W[bq]
(;B[cr]C[Again too passive (see variation)];W[pg];B[rj]LB[nd:A]
[qj:B]C[Surprising move. A play at A would be more conventional. If you want to reinforce the stone, B seems better than you move.]
;W[ng];B[nd];W[qq];B[kg]LB[mh:A][ni:B][nj:C]TR[pj][rj]C[David : The loss on the upper-right side is the major reason for my defeat. Should this move have been around A or B ? I tried to play a "capping move" (or what I think it is), but I probably should have mostly strengthened the marked stones (they later form a dead group).

---

The marked stones are not in grave danger for the moment. If you want to strengthen them, C is the best solution I think. I don't like A. B is possible. You played a capping move but let open a possible capping of your own stones at C.]
;W[po]
(;B[qr]C[If you wanted to cap the white stones, why not ignore white's move (which I believe is rather small) and proceed with the capping ?]

;B[od];W[me];B[md];W[gb];B[ga]LB[jb:A][kb:B][jc:C]C[David : For some reason playing hane here seemed like a good option. But I probably should have played at A or B to really close white's stones off. Or is there a better play ?

---

You hane is good, but it is a yose play worth 4 points and should be played later. A and B don't close the territory well enough, I'd go for C if that is what you want to achieve.]

(;B[no]LB[lj:D][oj:B][ok:A][rm:C]TR[pj][rj][nk]C[David : Maybe it would have been better to either strengthen my marked stones with something like A or B, or invade with C ?

C doesn't seem good, black is lacking room on the side to make two eyes and although he might succeed, it will lead to a difficult fight. A is the best of your options in my opinion.

D is in my opinion the best way to connect

;B[rh]LB[pk:A][pl:B]C[David : Should I have connected at A or B instead ?

---

Definitely you should have connected since white allowed you to. A is better than B as it connects the lower stone as well.]
;W[pk];B[qj];W[ni];B[mi];W[si];B[sh]LB[qi:B][ri:A][sj:C][sk:D]
C[David : The reason I played here was to seperate white. Then, if white played A, I could capture by playing B followed by C or D.

---

Black doesn't have enough room to live any more so white doesn't car about being cut.]
;W[nl]
(;B[gi]C[David : Here I tried to strengthen the stones keeping the two white groups appart. Now that it seems that they are strogn enough and that I should have done something about the upper right side. But that now seems lost !

---

It is indeed to late to worry about the right side. I would have prefered to try and make some territory in the center with the help of the aji (bad taste) that the black group on the right leaves.]

(;W[qh]C[Unless of course white doesn't care about them ...]

;W[nj];B[ll];W[ki];B[kj]LB[lg:B][lh:A][nk:C]TR[kg][mh][mi]C[David : Would it have been better to strengthen the marked stones ba playing at A or B ?

---

Yes, now your stones at C are safe you should have worried about these and connected with B.]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[mg];B[jh]LB[ih:A]TR[ig][kg][hi][jj]C[David : I played this to be able to connect the marked stones easily...

---

Looks unusual but efficient. A looks better but leads to the same result.]

Separated from what ? All white stones are alive, white will not care about being cut.

---

Yes, although a computer plays moves that are sometime questionable, you should always try to figure out what your opponent's purpose is with a move. If a move looks dumb, it might be because it really is dumb but more probabily because you did not understand it. This is especially true when you are playing a stronger player.]

;W[fg];B[gg]TR[rh][sh][pj][qj][rj][ok]C[David : I realize the biggest mistake in this game was the right side. In fact, had the marked stones been connected, the outcome would have been much better...

---

Yes. In a handicap game, you should try not to lose any of your handicap stones. Usually this is enough to win.]

[fs][gs][hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps]C[David : Any pointers on improving (besides playing a lot) would be greatly appreciated. Specifically the aspects which are lacking the most in my play. I am going to read some more go books soon, including : "Lessons in the fundamentals of go" by Kageyama, "The second book of go" by Bozulich, a proverbs book by the Nihon Ki-In, and "Graded problems for beginners" by Yoshinori. Any other suggested reading ?

---

I would suggest going to http://www.goproblems.com and solve as many problems as possible (play the 30k time trial and try go go as far as possible) over and over again. That helped me a lot. Try, every time you learn a new concept or joseki in a book to try it out in a real game as soon as possible. Basically keep a balance between theory and practise ;-)

About handicap games here are a few clues on how to improve :

* Try never to lose one of your handicap stones
* Cut white into  small unstable groups
* Avoid difficult fighting, white is bound to be a better fighter than you are
* Do not try to kill all of white's stones or you will die yourself. The idea is to let white live in small places and claim the biggest deal of the board.

On a positive note you have already pretty good understanding of the game and some good reflexes. That's an impressive game for someone who has only been playing for a week.
