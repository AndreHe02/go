C[DT (Daniel Tomé) - Hi dear go friend! 

Thank you for your time!

I'm not asking for a game review. I'm just trying to understand in what direction should I play in a certain situation. My question is about direction of play (and modern fuseki), and it may be hard to answer (some pros play x, others play y...).

I hope you can help me! Thanks again!

DC: Basically I have looked in to the fuseki and found a response in one of my books of how to respond in a new shape. I have highlighted but a few translated from Lee Chang Hao New Moves New Shapes. I hope it is of use to you.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[qj]C[DT - Here is the question: in which direction should Black attack R10? 

I know that the most *common* way is to play R8, but it may be also an *old* way.

I'm asking this because there are many *recent* pro games (2005-2008) in witch Black plays R12.

I could not find the answer to this problem, so I decided to send this question to GTL.

See variations, if you want to know what I found in "Get strong at attaking" (but please note that Get strong at attaking is kind of old too...)

The question is in the air :-)

It's my intention to understand the theory behind Black's R12 move (*drives White toward Black's strong position?*). If "Get strong at attaking" says it's the wrong direction, why are pros playing it now?

DC: the only explaination from my perspective is that it is a matter of the white group being made to feel uncomfortable with the r8, r13,r15 variation. Since this is deemed good for black White now tends to extend to r14 after r8, playing one of the very many variations arising from this flexible way of playing. 

This has been my focus in this brief fuseki review, also relying heavily on Lee Chang haos publication on the new moves new shapes. R8 Definatley seems the correct direction by principle and the only explaination I can Theorise upon for a few deviatios, is possibly the avoidance of complications arrising from the stil developmental lines that result from the R14 extension.]

(;B[ql]C[DT - This extension is played because "the distance from the small knight enclosure is perfect" and...]

(;W[qg];B[qe]C[DT - ... "R15 put severe pressure on White's stones." 

"Later Black will aim to enclose the corner with N17."
