C[Dear reviewer,

This review is for black. I have been experimenting with playing more influenced oriented since I used to be extremely territorial and got tired of that style of play. I enjoy the power that influence gives, but it's hard for me to know how to use it.

This game was played on KGS as part of the ASR league. I think that I lost the game in endgame when I allowed my opponent to play B3. I lost by 3.5 points

Black is about 3k and I don't know white's rank, but he is stronger than me.

Thank you for your time and effort, I will study your review thoroughly.

C[C: I would prefer to play at A personally. It is natural to approach the unbalanced corner first, although that's not to say your move is bad. You shouldn't be worried specifically about the pincer though, it is relatively balanced because white would be restricted to one side.

I played here because I wanted to coordinate with my other two stones. I also tought about playing at A (P4). But if white pincers the game may end up being split.]

;W[ch];B[ci]C[C: The standard move is at E13 here, although you may think about E12 to build the wall given the 2 stones on 4-4. This push is a bit too direct.

Was this ok, or is it crude?];W[bi];B[dh]C[C: Notice you could have played this move without C11, the shape would be a bit better. The idea to build the wall is not bad, given the opening.

Same here, what do you think about this push?];W[cg];B[ef]LB[dm:A]
C[C: It is big, but not necessary to play right away. It is more of an early endgame move or if there is something else in the board position.

Why doesn't white play A (D7) with the next move? It looks really big.]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[cd]LB[ce:A]C[C: I would actually prefer not to play at A directly, given you already have the E14 stone.

should I play A (C15) instead of the next game move?];B[jd]
;W[qf];B[of]C[C: This move is too passive. The purpose of the wall is not to make territory directly, but to attack. The pincer would be natural given black's strength on the outside.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[op]C[C: This is a natural move.

I guess I ended up playing here anyway. What do you think?]
;W[mp]C[C: I would play the standard one-point jump at P6 and look to counter-pincer the N4 stone. Because of the walls, any fighting is very favorable for black.

What is the best way to reply to this move to make it work with my moyo? In the game I messed up with the next move.]
;B[qo]C[This was a big mistake. I checked and this move is not even joseki. I lost a lot here.]
;W[pp]C[Golombia [-\]: sorry I'm lagging. I'm in the mountains of Costa Rica. If I loose connection please wait a few minutes until I return. Thanks.]

;W[nq];B[mr];W[nr];B[lr];W[np];B[kq]C[C: You are correct, this is a big loss for black. I think a good rule of thumb to remember is that touching stones strengthens both sides. If you are strong outside like here, it is generally better to attack from a distance.]
;W[hq];B[bp]C[C: Given the state of the board, this move is now probably too passive. You can consider invading directly at C3.]
;W[cq];B[dm]C[C: E7 is the better shape to connect.];W[de];B[ee]
;W[db];B[fc]C[C: I would prefer to play at E17 instead, you leave a ko threat here.

Is this the best way to defend the territory?];W[lo];B[ko];W[kn]
;B[ir]C[C: K5 is better, it leaves an out towards the center. This move is a bit too negative.]
;W[iq];B[hr];W[gr];B[jq]C[C: Still better to play at K5.];W[jo]
C[C: You wanted to avoid this move, now white's groups are connected and your 3 stones on the bottom right have lost what potential they had.]
;B[qi];W[hs];B[js];W[kp];B[kr]C[C: White shape's on the bottom takes away some of the value of the walls. It is generally better to give your groups a path into the center rather than living small on the edge.]
;W[lc]LB[jg:A]C[C: In my opinion, the situation would be much different if you had the stones at K5 and L5.

All along I wanted to play A (K13) but never got to it and now my opponent invades.]

(;B[kb]C[C: I would consider L17 here. The classic response at M16 would be heavy in this situation, white would probably play at M15 instead and you can attack from there. Consider the variation.

Trying to take the base away. What is the best way to attack that stone?]

C[C: P12 is a little faster.];W[mi];B[lh]C[C: I would prefer to keep it in reserve, you may want the option to peep from the other side.

Was this peep ok?];W[mh];B[ph]C[C: You end in gote because of the peep as well because of P13 instead of P12.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[md]LB[nc:A]C[C: You are being a little too fancy here, I agree you should play solidly at A. Plus, L15 gives white a nice shape.

What do you think about this move? should I just play A (O17)]
;W[ke];B[je];W[nb];B[oa];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[kd];W[ld]C[C: The move didn't work out for you unfortunately.]
;B[kj];W[mk];B[eb];W[cb];B[dg];W[cf];B[ik]LB[bq:A]C[C: You've spotted it already, A is a big endgame move. Center territory always looks big, but if you count the points the classic endgame moves on the sides are almost always better. In any case, J9 is passive, you would want to consider K8 or L8 instead. L8 gives you a last threat to separate the white group on the top.

I played here because I wanted to secure that territory, but letting my opponent play A (B3) was too big. What would you do?]

[re][rq][rr][rs][sa][sb][sc][sd][se][sq][sr][ss]C[C: To summarize, I would make the same recommendation I make to many single-digit kyu players: it would be very helpful for you to work on attacking and taking advantage of walls. White played a very deep invasion at the top and was never truly under real pressure. I think the center territory would be at least 10 points bigger with a more efficient attack. There were a couple other moves (bottom right, the endgame move on the bottom left), but you pointed those out yourself already, which is very good.

Tenebre [?\]: very close ^^])
