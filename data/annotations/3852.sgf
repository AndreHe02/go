C[I am white.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[fq];W[dq]LB[po:A]C[A simple choice.  I could also ignore this and approach near A.

RGW: E4 is also possible.];B[iq];W[po]TR[fq][iq]LB[pn:A][qn:B]
C[Now that black has a solid group on the bottom this may be too ambitious.   A or B may be safer.   But I think this is playable, too.

RGW: I agree.];B[qm];W[on]LB[qq:A]C[The joseki starting at A may also work here.

RGW: Yes.  I don't know which is better here.];B[np];W[qf]LB[qq:A]
[pl:B]C[Joseki would call for me to attach at A or press at B.   But I was interested in seeing what black would do in the upper corner first.  This is probably a mistake.

RGW: It may have been better to play B first.];B[qh]TR[qm]C[I think this is a good move.   It is a standard pincer, but it also helps black's marked stone.]
;W[of]LB[qc:A]C[I also considered the invasion at A, but this is a  bit too easy on black.]
;B[nc]
(;W[qj]LB[pi:A]C[It seems natural to invade here, although the press at A is joseki.

RGW: This looks good to me since it keeps the two black stones separated.]
;B[oh];W[pl]C[RGW: Good.];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp];W[qn]
;B[mh]LB[rm:A]C[W24 at 'A' may be better shape here.

RGW: I don't think so.];W[mf]LB[pf:A]C[This jump seems natural, but black can cut at A.

RGW: True, but with the W stones below, I'm not sure that would be very good for B.  (See my variation on the next move.)]

(;B[ld];W[kf];B[ok];W[pi]TR[qm]LB[pm:A]C[The marked black stone leaves some bad aji for white.  A may be the honte move.

RGW: Yes, this leaves W very thin.  Personally, I would have played Q9, but I'm a very conservative player.]
;B[ph];W[kh]C[RGW: This move certainly shows a fighting spirit although both W groups have weaknesses.]
;B[rm];W[sn];B[qk]C[Ouch!]
(;W[ol]C[RGW: I think R9 would have been better (see variation).]

(;B[rj]C[RGW: B should have played R9 here.];W[pk];B[qi];W[pj]
;B[rk]C[I think black is alive now.

RGW: Not quite, but definitely better off than before.];W[jc]
C[RGW: This seems off the mark.  W has two weak groups already.  If this move was to help the stones on line 14, it should have been at K16.]

(;B[ci]C[RGW: What if B had decided to split the stones on K and L?]
;W[cf];B[cl];W[rd]LB[gc:A]C[The slide is not so big now.  Maybe A is better.

RGW: The slide is Ok -- it is probably sente since the three B stones are not yet settled.  A is a little ambiguous.  If you want to keep B from jumping into the corner and getting a live group, you need to play D17 or E17.  Something around J15 or K15 would help connect the stones at K17 and L14.]
;B[qc];W[ec]C[RGW: Good -- you got the sente move at S16 AND protected your corner.]
;B[kb]
(;W[jd]LB[jb:A][kc:B]C[This is a stange move.  A or B better here.

RGW: This wouldn't be a bad move except that it leaves the top open and B can play J18.  I think B may be best.  (See variations.)]
;B[ib]
(;W[cn]C[RGW: I think it may have been worthwhile to try to stop B at the top.]
;B[gc]C[This is a big reduction for black.];W[bj]C[I'm trying to take black's base here with this tesuji.]
;B[cj];W[bl];B[bk];W[ak];B[ck];W[bm];B[nk]C[RGW: B's living dangerously, leaving the stones on the left.]
;W[jq]LB[mn:A]C[The plan is to play lightly here and reduce black's potential to expand.  However, it would probably be better for me to first jump at A because after B61, white is short on eyes and eye space.  It's a dangerous plan.

RGW: I agree. N7 might be better than A.  If B plays N7, your group will be struggling for eyes.]
;B[jp];W[kp];B[kq];W[jo];B[jr];W[mo]LB[mn:A]C[Still, A may be better.

RGW: This looks like good shape, but is vulnerable to the push and cut at O5/N6.  I think I would still prefer N7, but A would probably be better than this.]
;B[no];W[nn];B[mn];W[pm];B[ko];W[mm]LB[kn:A]C[Wrong atari, I think.  Maybe A is better.

RGW: I think it's the right atari.  Your group still doesn't have two eyes so you don't want B playing at N7 and cutting you off from the center.  Unfortunately, your efforts to reduce B ends up mostly wasted.]
;B[ln];W[kn];B[lp];W[lm];B[lo]C[RGW: Unfortunately, you've solidified B's position and still don't have two eyes.]
;W[jm];B[lk];W[jk]LB[io:A]C[It's hard for me to tell whether A might be better.

RGW: I think L8, L9, or even J8 would be better.  This move leaves B with the threat at L8.]

(;B[in]C[RGW: What happens if B is more aggressive?];W[rc];B[jn]
;W[km];B[il];W[qb];B[pb]
(;W[fo]C[RGW: I'm not sure how helpful this move is.  How about J7? Or playing it safe at L9?]
;B[fm];W[le];B[do];W[co]LB[dn:A]C[White can resist at A instead, I think.

RGW: Yes, that would be better, I think.];B[ep];W[ng];B[nh]
C[At this point I resigned because I felt I was behind and needed to go somewhere else anyway.  But maybe the game is not over and probably depends on how much white can make in the upper left.  I can't really judge that.

RGW: W is definitely behind and doesn't have a lot of opportunities left.  For the most part, you played reasonable moves.  I think the major problems were allowing the center right goup to get into trouble and letting B get into your area in the upper left.]
