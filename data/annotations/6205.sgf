AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hello, I am AvatharTri and I will be your reviewer.

For any terms you don't understand that I use, look them up on Sensei's Library.]
;W[dd];B[dj];W[dh]LB[fc:D][jd:A][jj:E][pj:B][jp:C]C[This seems an odd play for white, especially since he's behind by a 3 stone handicap, I would suggest you tenuki. Any of the lettered responses is what I would suggest. If he does attack D10, see variation.]

(;B[gj];W[ej]C[again, odd for white.];B[ek]C["I cant have him control the lower left. I have to contest his position."

Your response looks good, but maybe not for that reason. This response seems to be the most solid, and as black in a handicap game, you should be solid.]

[ip:C][jp:B][kp:D][cq:T][fq:A][iq:G][jq:F][kq:E][nq:H][qq:S]
C["Now that he has no more chance to control the lower left, I must wall him off from the upper right."

Your thinking is way overly defensive. Early on in the game, build up influence and potential. If some of the potential territories don't work out, fine, you'll get compensation. This play is trying to grab too much. White can live easily by playing anywhere shown with a letter, and you'd be hard pressed to contain him. This is WAY too early to be thinking defensively. When you are thinking only of defense, your opponent has control of the game and can then push you around and bully you.]
;W[gh];B[hh];W[hi]LB[ih:B][ii:A]C[you win the ladder here by the way. A to start the ladder to capture, B to extend, which will very much so hurt the stone.]
;B[hf]C[This play doesn't make too much sense to me, it opens a slew of potential forcing moves for white.]
;W[hj]C["Uh-oh. He got on top of me and now has a chance to control the lower left"

His stones have little to no bearing on the left side, but they greatly influence the right side. If fighting were to break out on the right, he would try to push the fighting out into the center, where he's backed up by his own wall.

See variation for another way to play.]
(;B[gl];W[gk];B[fk];W[ik];B[hk];W[hl]C[so what if he captures that stone? You don't lose too much, especially since it is then ko. See some of the variations.]

(;B[gk];W[jl]C[Now your stones on the left are way over concentrated, inefficient, and kinda clumpy. Unless it's the endgame, clumps of stones are generally bad to have.]
;B[hn];W[hg];B[ih];W[ji]C["He is threatening to control the entire middle of the board."

If he wants the middle so badly, then give it to him, just take something of equal or greater value in the meantime, such as the sides.]
;B[gg];W[fh];B[ig];W[ii]LB[fc:D][pj:C][hm:A][jp:B]C[If you notice now, you have almost 50 points just from the lower left corner alone, this is more than enough for you to be able to just play conservatively and solidly and come off with a blow-out victory. You have strong strength with which to control the upper side. You have two additional corners, compared to white's one. Your advantage now is much higher that at the beginning of the game, white has been failing to catch up. Remember, many games end up with ~50 points per player, you don't have to take half the board, just more than your opponent. Now is an excellent time to either tenuki, or solidify the lower left.]
;B[lj]C[Over play, white can still wiggle out, and attack you at the same time now.]
;W[kj];B[ll];W[lk];B[mk];W[kk];B[kl]C[You should learn as quickly as you can to stop making this mistake. Imagine yourself as the stones, you've just rammed your head into a wall! Your group gained no more liberties, and you have sever cutting points all around.]
;W[mj]C[Which white capitalizes on.];B[li];W[ml];B[nk];W[km]
;B[lm]C["He has me completely on the defensive... I dont like this."

You kinda started out on the defensive, but even so, it's not bad for you, N8 is very weak and he's leaving himself with cutting points. Plus you now almost control a huge potential territory on the lower right..]
;W[mm];B[ln];W[lo];B[il];W[im]C["Bad move on my part."

Yeah, learn to stop making those. Think out your opponent's response before you move.]
;B[kn];W[jm];B[mn];W[nn]C[Now you can kill. See variation.]

(;B[hm];W[om];B[il];W[jo];B[jn];W[in];B[ko];W[kp];B[mo];W[lp]
;B[no];W[op];B[on];W[nm]C[You have double atari at J5 by the way, see variation.]

(;B[po];W[pn];B[oo];W[mp];B[np];W[nq];B[pk];W[oq];B[pm];W[pl]
;B[qn];W[ok]C[You can kill by the way. This is called a snap back. Learn to see it, it's powerful. See the variation.]

(;B[nj];W[mi];B[mh];W[ni];B[oi];W[nh];B[ng];W[oh];B[ph];W[og]
C["He is caught in a ladder."

Yes, never play out a single move of a ladder you will lose. Your opponent is making a HUGE mistake here.]

;B[se];W[rd];B[rc];W[hl];B[sd];W[oj];B[pj];W[ol];B[ql];W[qk]
;B[nl];W[il];B[bj]C["I think he is more threatening along the bottom than the left side. I should have walled him off there first."

Yeah, this move is worth so little.];W[ci]C[I wouldn't make B9 yet myself. Having it be your turn to play somewhere else is worth more than the ~2 points that saves you. See the variation.]

(;B[bk];W[kh];B[kg];W[lg];B[lh];W[jh];B[lf];W[gd]LB[jc:A]C[White's stone at M14 is not threatening, and wont ever really be aji, so leave it alone for now. Your position is so high that white can take the upper side for himself at any time, play something like K17 to take it all for yourself.]
;B[mg]C[Wasted move.];W[ff];B[hp];W[ho];B[go];W[gn];B[gm];W[gp]
;B[fn];W[ip]C[See variation.]
(;B[hd];W[hq];B[hb]C["I can gain more territory at the top than the bottom, so I play up top."

Yes, but you can do that anytime, the bottom is more urgent.

Also, this play doesn't net you territory, but induces a response from your opponent that will probably make him stronger.]
;W[hc];B[ic];W[gc];B[fp];W[he];B[id];W[gf];B[if];W[fg]C[How much is that one stone worth? It's half a point. Ignore it. There are other moves worth ~20 points.]
;B[hg];W[gr];B[ie]C[Worth nothing, a wasted move. White doesn't have to respond. See variation.]

;W[ps];B[qr];W[fb];B[rk];W[aj];B[ak];W[ai];B[ga];W[fa];B[gb]
C[ouch, see variation.]
(;W[pb]C["A brave effort by my opponent. I need to surround him to control this territory"

More like a shameful waste of time, since you can kill him easily.]
;B[ob];W[oa]
(;B[mb]C["I think O19 was a good move."

It's not too important, white's potential to live is so small, though I think you should of played O18 here, as it is much more solid. See variations for O18 and O19. O19 is sketchy, as is N18 here.]
;W[nb];B[oc];W[ma];B[nc];W[na];B[mc];W[ib]C["Oversight on my part. Now I lose 3 stones.

But more importantly I lose territory."

eh, you still win if you kill white up there, which you should be able to. Don't worry about it too much. Just learn to see that mistake before you play the move you did earlier, see earlier commentation and variation.]
