C[J: Hi, my name is Jorik Mandemaker and I've reviewed this game.
I'm only about 5k so remember that my advice isn't absolute truth. I have marked all my comments with a J. If I use any terms you don't understand you can look them up at senseis library (senseis.xmp.net)]
;B[pc];W[dq];B[dc];W[qp];B[jc];W[co];B[qh];W[ce];B[ch];W[ee]
;B[jf];W[fc]C[J: Good move. Black should have played F16. Since he didn't you can seal him in the corner.]
;B[cd];W[bd];B[bc];W[dd];B[cc]
(;W[be]C[J: Saving that stone isn't important. E17 gives you much better shape, see the variation.]
;B[ed];W[de];B[ec];W[fd];B[fb];W[gb];B[eb]MA[fe][gc]C[J: White's wall has cutting points now so you have to defend. But the one at F15 is much more important then the cut at G17. If black cut's at F15 you're group would be cut right in two, but if he cuts at G17 he can only get a single stone. See the variation for the next move.]

(;W[gc];B[cb]C[I thought I definitely got the better outcome here.

J: Sealing black in in sente is an excellent result of course But the cut at F15 is really bothersome. Blacks corner is alive even without C18 what would you have done if he had cut instead?]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[ck];B[di];W[ej];B[eh];W[gg]C[Played this move because:

1) Worried about upper left being cut off with no eyes
2) Trying to cut off the left/forcing it to run

J: Your worries are very just. This move protects the cut nicely and attacks the group on the left. So this is a dual-purpose moves and those are allways good.]
;B[gh];W[fh]C[J: Cutting a one point jump is not a good idea unless you are very strong locally. Playing the hane at H12 would be good. It helps you move your upper left group out into the center.]

(;B[fg];W[fi];B[gf];W[hg];B[ff];W[eg];B[ef];W[dg];B[df];W[cg]
;B[cf];W[bg];B[bf]C[Mistake here

J: No the next move is right. The mistake came a move later.]

(;W[af];B[bh]
(;W[ei]C[Stupid play

J: Yes this was the mistake. H14 kills everything. See the variation.]
;B[dh];W[bj];B[ag]C[Serenities [12k\]: Oops];W[hf]C[Variation would have been better for black, I think

J: That's right. Black would get everything.]
(;B[fe];W[he];B[ig];W[hi];B[ii];W[hh];B[ih]
(;W[lc]TR[pe][qe]C[I saw a couple points of "invasion," but it seemed pretty difficult. I ended up using the threat of connecting the two invasions to reduce his territory from the side.

J: Both the points you marked and the point you played are possible ways to invade. But it's a deep invasion. Black is strong. At this point it's not very urgent to invade right now. If black handles it allright he'll get a lot of strength. Combined with the points he has in the upper left he will have a good position and can dictate the rest of the game.

You don't need to invade right now. See the variations for some other ideas.

If you still want to invade then R15 looks like a better place. It's closer to the corner and farther away from the wall on the J-collumn]
;B[id];W[jb];B[ib];W[kb]
(;B[hd]C[J: This move is very slow by black. See the variation]

(;W[qe]C[Threaten to connect

J: Making two invasions like this is hardly ever a good idea. One of them is bound to die like this, if not both. Playing
O17 right now makes a base for your invasion.];B[nc];W[oe];B[ld]
;W[pj]C[And use the two stones to attack this one

J: Those two stones aren't strong at all they're under attack themself. You'r trying to pick a fight where black is strong (Wall on J-collumn, solid corner) that's not a very good idea. If black jumps out at P12 you might just barely be able to make two eyes let alone attack the stone at R12]

(;B[pf];W[qf]C[J: Good. Playing Q15 isn't going to help you.]

[si][sj]C[Now the right side is mostly my territory, while earilier I felt it was pretty strongly black's influence. I feel I got a good result here, but black's upper territory is now rock solid.

What's your read on the situation?

J: You definatly got an excellent result here. But it only makes sense that black has now solid territory on the upper side. This is very normal when a moyo is invaded.
The invading player will usually be able to make some living group while the defending player attacks the group and solidifies the rest of the moyo doing so.

A count gives black about 75 points at the top and
white around 16 points on the right, 25 on the left and 6,5 komi for a total of a little over 45 points. But the open areas on the bottom and right look  a lot more promising for white then for black so I'd say white is doing allright.]
;B[oq];W[mq]C[J: Playing a pincer is a good idea because of your position in the lower left.]
;B[qr]
(;W[qq]C[J: Black R2 was a mistake. You missed a good opportunity here. Play P4 to seal black in. See the variation.]

[io][ip][jp][kp][kq][qk][ql][qm][qn][qo]C[My goal here was to seal off the right side and the left sides, possibly the center. I wasn't intent on killing at first.

J: That's the right idea.];B[mp];W[lp];B[np];W[lo];B[nn];W[lq]
C[J: This cut isn't something to worry about. Black can just get one unimportant stone. J10 instead would make your moyo really big.]
;B[il]
(;W[hk]C[J: This move doesn't do very much. The black stone can easly escape to the top or right. Based on the earlier count I'd say you'd win easily by just defending around H6.]

;B[ml];W[kn]C[J: This move looks like it's trying to kill the big black group. But that's very hard. Your four stones are allmost surrounded. I suggest playing J4 to help them and make territory. Black still is under attack that way.]

;W[pl];B[om];W[oo]C[J: Now black suddenly has no secure eyes yet. And very little room to try and make them.]
;B[no]C[J: Black is handing you free moves]
(;W[ol]C[J: This destroys the eye there but never forget your goal, secure territory first. Even if he makes one eye here I can't see the second one yet. G5 looks like it just kills black. And even if it doesn't you've secured more terriotory on the bottom and left.]

;W[cm];B[en];W[bq];B[cr];W[bp];B[fr];W[gr];B[ds]C[Thank you for your comments!

Any general advice on what to work on would be appreciated as well.

J: My general advice is:

1) Protect your cuts. If your opponent cuts a group in half that's generally not very unpleasant. But don't save every single stone. Often sacrificing one or two stones helps a lot.

2) When you are winning don't go looking for fights. If you're ahead you should play a bit more defensive then normal. Of course you shouldn't give your opponent a chance to catch up by doing nothing but defending.]
