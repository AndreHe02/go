[jp]L[fp][pj]C[TS: Simply playing 'a' seems better; this leaves White the next move.


MG:  Playing the bottom hoshi is actually quite common (and if Black has played near 'b' it is ideal).  Of course, Black has to know how to deal with the various double kakaris that may follow when playing this way.]
;W[en]L[fp]C[MG:  An interesting move (Takemiya has played it from time to time as a part of his "cosmic" fuseki), but it has the drawback of forcing Black toward his K4 stone with 'a' (which is something Black wants to do anyway).  Still, if White is expert in playing a moyo game, this is probably playable.]
;B[fp];W[md]C[MG:  Nice.  Consistent with White's moyo strategy.];B[dc]
L[ed][ee]C[TS: This is what I hoped for.


MG:  Black has to play at 'a' or 'b' to limit White's moyo.  D17 is playing right into his hands.]
;W[ed]L[fc][fd][gc]C[MG:  The keima kake is perfect here:  pressing down on d17 with sente should be automatic with the thickness White has on the left side. Even without such thickness, White should look at the pressing move first when considering alternatives ('a', 'b', 'c', etc.). Another advantage of the kake is that it's pretty much impossible for Black to tenuki.]
;B[dd]L[ee][de]C[MG: A _bad_ move.  This sort of push is playable only when cutting immediately after at 'a' is useful (which it rarely is).  The push is also aji keshi:  Black may later want to jump through at 'b' to cut on the other side.]
;W[de];B[ec]L[ee]M[dd]C[TS: This contradicts the marked stone, whose purpose is to cut at 'a'. If Black doesn't want to cut, better to omit the marked stone and simply play e17.]
;W[fd];B[fc]M[dd]L[gc]C[TS: Now the drawback of the marked stone is obvious; Black would like to jump to 'a', but he has a shortage of liberties.]
;W[gd];B[hc];W[hd];B[ic];W[ej]L[dj][gn][hp][cj]M[ej]C[MG:  This looks like trying to do two things at once but not accomplishing either well.  I'd play 'a' to solidify the moyo or 'b' (the better choice as it also threatens 'c') to expand the moyo.


White can always cap with the marked stone if Black invades at 'd'.  Still, it's hard to know what the best move is here.]
;B[bo];W[bn]L[qf][gn][qn][nq]C[MG:  White's move is rather too territory oriented.  White is staking the whole game on being able to make big points in the center.

Any of choices 'a' through 'd' instead would be more interesting.];B[gn]
;W[gl]L[gm][hj]C[MG:  I'm not sure that White should answer in this area with so many interesting kakaris to play elsewhere.  A better local defense might be 'a' or 'b'.]
;B[fm];W[fl]L[el]C[MG:  'a' instead of F8 might work out better.];B[dm]
;W[em];B[dn];W[dl];B[cm];W[do];B[co];W[eo];B[cl];W[ep];B[dq];W[eq];B[dr]
;W[ck];B[dk]L[bl][el][bm][dj][bq]C[MG:  Black missed White 'a', Black 'b', then 'c', connect and 'd'. If White saves his stones, then the Black corner develops aji at 'e'.]
;W[el]L[bl]C[MG:  Too bad!  'a' would probably have won the game for White.

TS: <slap!> What a moron!];B[bk];W[cj];B[bl];W[nq]L[qn][mp][hr][mo]
[nq]M[fp][jp][fm][gn]C[TS: This looks overplayish.. I was afraid that 'a' is too slow, and that by sketching out a moyo by itself would enable Black to win on territory alone. I therefore reasoned I should try to engineer (fake? :-) an attack against the marked stones and attempt to stake out the moyo by attacking.  

MG:  Invading so deeply between two strong enemy positions is probably just looking for trouble.  My guess is that breaking up a potential Black moyo by playing 'a' would be enough.  White's likely to get something on the right side when all's said and done, and the 3-3 invasion and slide to 'c' are miai so Black won't get as many points here as it looks.


To invade the lower side, even 'b' is probably too low -- maybe 'd' would be a good place to start.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[lp];B[fq]L[kq]C[MG:  Black's not going to get many points on the lower side and his group is pretty safe, so F3 is not useful, in fact it weakens his left corner.  ('a' is a popular point to begin the attack on this White shape.)]
;W[er];B[jn];W[mm]L[jq][qi][qk][qg][ql][qf]M[mm]C[MG:  This makes one of the standard shapes, but I'd play 'a' first to see what Black does.  (If Black moves in such a way as to give the white group easy life whenever he wants it, then play 'b' instead of the marked stone -- this makes 'c' --> 'f' and 'd' --> 'e' miai, and leaves open the possibility of 3-3 invasions on the right side.)]
;B[bj]L[jl][id][om][qi][pf]C[TS: this seems a bit small for this stage, although I don't know exactly what Black _should_ do.


MG:  Agreed.  It's only points, no real threat on anything.  And gote!  You want to make threats that take points.  Almost any big-looking move would be preferable for Black (consider 'a' to 'e').]
;AW[jl]L[jk][mk][om][km]C[MG:  A great move!  Maybe not the exact correct point, but the right idea.  Maybe 'a' instead, and if Black plays against the lower-right group White can dodge with 'b', 'c', or 'd'.]
;B[ln];W[ko]L[mn][jq]C[MG:  I'd rather not peep and weaken the White wall in the center, which already has bad aji.  (The peep probably kills White's chances with the 'b' aji.)  Does 'a' work?]
;B[jo];W[kn];B[jm];W[km];B[il];W[ik];B[kl];W[jk];B[kp];W[lq];B[kr];W[lk]
;B[ci];W[id]L[dj][hq][id]C[MG:  If the White moyo were closed at the left, this would be a perfect move.  It's hard to find the best move here, but saving the two stones should be considered ('a' goes a long way in closing the center, and the large group gets a certain eye [the eye alone isn't enough to justify taking gote, though\]).


Playing something like 'b' to tease Black might be interesting at this point.]
;B[jd];W[je];B[ke];W[kd];B[jc];W[le]L[jf][ld]M[le]C[TS: 'a' is probably better. If Black 'b', _then_ the marked stone.


MG:  Absolutely!  This is the famous 'thickness' tesuji (whose name I don't remember 8-).]
;B[kf];W[lf];B[ee];W[if]L[ef]C[TS: Why on earth I didn't play 'a'?

(MG: When I do things like this, I mention my brain tumor.  8^)];B[ef]L[dg][dh]C[MG:  Sorry, I don't see a good way for White to redeem himself.'a' will probably do something inelegant but functional, and 'b' looks interesting.  Any 7-dans have the definitive answer?]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[dh];B[di];W[eh]L[ei]C[TS: Achh, 'a' is better. My reading went haywire at this stage.]
;B[ei];W[fi];B[fh];W[fg];B[df];W[cf];B[fj]L[cg]C[MG:  Playing 'a' and squeezing might be better.]
;W[gh];B[gi];W[fh];B[ek];W[gj];B[dj];W[pf]L[hi]C[TS: Again I misread. As painful as it is, 'a' seems necessary.]
;B[gk];W[hj];B[hl];W[fk];B[hk];W[ej];B[lo];W[lm];B[fj];W[cp];B[bp];W[ej]
;B[nn];W[mn];B[fj]
(;W[im]L[hn][hq]C[MG: 'a' looks interesting instead and might work well with 'b'.


TS: The thing is, it loses threats - I don't think I can afford to lose the ko, can I?


MG: You're right that W 'a' instead of the immediate atari loses a ko threat, but it seems to open some very interesting possibilities for White if followed by 'b'. See variation B.]
;B[hm];W[ej];B[no];W[mo];B[fj];W[hn];B[in];W[ej];B[jf];W[ie];B[fj];W[gm]
L[ho]C[MG:  'a' would have more aji.];B[ho];W[ej];B[kc];W[ld];B[fj];W
[bq];B[cq];W[ej];B[qf];W[fj];B[pg];W[qc];B[pc];W[qe];B[pe];W[of];B[og];W
[qg]L[rf][qd]C[TS: Looks like I should settle for 'a'-r13-'b'.


MG:  True.  That exchange would leave the three Black stones a little shaky, so White should get sente.]
;B[rf];W[oe]L[re]C[MG:  Playing 'a' instead might have paid some large profits.]
;B[qh];W[re];B[rg];W[qb];B[pb];W[od];B[mb];W[lb]L[qd]C[TS: White can still live by playing 'a', although the game seems lost anyway.]
;B[nb];W[oc];B[ob];W[lc];B[rb];W[rc];B[qd];W[sb];B[ra];W[rd];B[qa];W[pa]
;B[oa];W[ma];B[se]C[White resigns.])
(;W[hn]L[hm]C[MG: At this point, Black can continue with 'a', which reverts to the game sequence except that the White stone has one more liberty.

More likely, though...];B[im]C[MG: Next, W takes ko, B makes another ko threat, W answers the threat, B takes the ko.

Next...];W[go]L[hq][fr][es][br]C[MG: This pretty much guarantees an eye. If Black next fills the ko, 'a' splits Black into two groups. I looked at this for a while and couldn't find a good continuation for Black. It looks like Black could lose the whole thing if he gets greedy.


Note that, if Black forces 'b' --> 'c', White gets a couple of liberties in the corner in sente with the placement of 'd', which will come in handy in the semeai.)
