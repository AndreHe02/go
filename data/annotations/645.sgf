Result: W+Resign
Reviewer: aga 10k* NNGS, aga16 14k* IGS

aga: Not enclosing your moyo at move #82 was your main mistake. You've lost there about 80 pts! Not protecting LL group at move #74 was big mistake too, but it's still maximum 30 pts. Most other your moves was resonable although I made several minor remarks.

aga: Don't forget that I'm only 10k, so some of my remarks can be incomplete or wrong, or can be just a question of style. Feel free to argue with me.

aga: P.S. And I still think you are somewhat underrated ;-)]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[fq];B[cn];W[jp]LB[lp:a][hp:b][jq:c]C[aga: Note, that bottom side isn't my territory yet; later you'd like to reduce it with a or b or even c.]

(;B[jd];W[qf];B[qh]C[aga: All is absolute right up to this move.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[aga: This is somewhat inconsistent with san-ren-sei you've played. Look at variation - you like that result, don't you?]
;W[pc];B[oc]LB[od:a]C[aga: This is an overplay. With wR14 in place you should play 'a' instead: AFAIK you can't contain w small in corner here.

aga: Now 'a' is good cutpoint for w. I made mistake exploiting this weakness in the game, but I put several variations here to let you see what could happen.]

(;W[ob];B[nc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ci];B[cf];W[cl]
(;B[em]LB[en:a][dm:b][fo:c]C[aga: Right idea, but this move isn't good, as game shows. Locally, 'a' is safer. 'b' can be played too. But 'c' is even better move here. it can't be cut off (compare relation between wC8 vs bC6 and wF3 vs bD4), it reduces w bottom moyo, it threatens to invade in w bottom moyo, it separates w groups, it partially encloses w bottom group, it's sente, it builds some thickness to attack w left group stronger. Uff ;-)

aga: Another interesting possibility is to play from LR corner shimari.]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[en];B[eo];W[fn];B[dl];W[cm];B[dk];W[ck];B[fm]
;W[fo];B[fk]C[aga: So, what you've gained with this sequence? Just two separated unsettled groups. And wF5 and wF6 stones have territorial value ~20 pts, and much of influence.]
;W[no]C[aga: ... and now w bottom is even larger and stronger.]
;B[on]MA[pl][pk]C[aga: Not very useful move. If you could play it at O6... but you can't, so you should just protect side with something like Q8 or Q9.]
;W[jc]C[aga: Attaching underneath (on a side or at a corner) have lot of complexed variations, and low kyu players are rare knows how to handle it properly (I don't know it completely too ;-) ). Any case, you played well here.]

;B[ie];W[fe];B[gf];W[de];B[ce];W[ef]
;B[df];W[eg];B[gh]C[aga: Now, secured territory is about even (~60 pts). I can hope that risky deep invasion/reduction to your right side will not be neccessary. I decided to play now several moves to reduce your territory and increase mine, and do more exact count after that.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[pr];B[qq];W[bn];B[co];W[bo];B[bp];W[cr]
(;B[dq]C[aga: Bad move. See variations.];W[br]
(;B[bq]C[aga: after wB2 you can't unconditionally live locally, so you should cut and try to run destroying my largest territory. You'll  have miai creating second eye locally or outside.]
;W[ep]
(;B[gn]C[aga: Yes, this is very big; but remember the proverb: 'first urgent, then big moves'. Maybe it's hard to believe - but bD4 group is still can live with bE3 push in sente!]
;W[go]C[aga: Yes, I'm very greedy ;-) Protecting at bF4 is urgent.]
;B[hn];W[eq]C[aga: Capturing b stones is big; but your moyo is now huge and open only around M6. Just close it there, and you won.]

(;B[lo]C[aga: No, I don't like this, too deep. Since both wK4 and wO5 have the way into your moyo, after your reduction of my moyo I'll reduce your one. Look at variation here for better play.]
;W[lq];B[mn]LB[mm:a][lm:b]MA[jn]TR[lo]C[aga: BTW, this move is seems better to be played at 'a' (yes, you've already seen that shape in joseki I gave in variation playing UR corner). Another possibility is 'b' - it is often played shape too. Both 'a' and 'b' helps protect the gap around K6. Marked b stone can be sacrificed if necessary.]
