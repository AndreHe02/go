;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk];W[ci]C[c11 / chinese opening is uncommon for White, because B has the initiative, this makes it very passive, but not really a mistake.]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[pn]C[a very peaceful opening. Black stands more active, she has many stones on the 4th line while White is rather flat.
D2 is very territory-oriented, you could start an invasion with h3 or q13 for exapmple.
Another possibility would be to build your own framework with g5.]
;W[dr];B[er]C[E2 is a mistake by black, it's an endgame move.

C15 is very passive again.
You should do something on the lower side.  If B gets to play aroud g6 she will build a very large framework.]

My facit: You should try to play more actively, it seems, you are afraid of fighting a little bit, but maybe it's just this game, I don't know.  Don't think too much of territory in the beginning.
When you want to play on the third line, think about what the stone would look like one line above. Don't play area-securing moves in the beginning because you are afraid of an invasion. If you handle the invasion right you will gain something too, try to practice that. Best example is the invasion in the upper left, you could have taken much profit out of that. Especially, when your opponent doesn't have space to settle the group at the edge, attack it in a way that it will become heavy. Not with the intention to kill it, but with the intention to hunt it as long as possible, by making profit in the meantime. 

I hope my review will help you, if you have any more questions feel free to contact me again.
