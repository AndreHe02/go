SQ[nq][qn][qf][nc][cf][fc]C[Approaching one of black's corners would be better here.]
;B[fp];W[eo];B[cg];W[eh]SQ[cj]C[This is the beginning of a strong white focus on the center. It is much harder to make territory in the center than it is on the sides or in the corners.  So, in general, you should focus on making corner and side territory first and worry about the center last.

C10 would be a good response to black's move since it blocks black out of the lower left side.]
;B[bj];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi];W[cj]TR[bl]SQ[jj][qf][nq][qn]
[fc][nc]C[You don't need to connect here now.  Black can't cut the white stones apart.

B8 would work to block black out of the lower left side.  Any of the squares would be reasonable choices as well.]
;B[cl];W[dl];B[cm];W[dm];B[cq];W[cp];B[er];W[dq];B[jj]C[This move makes all of the white stones facing the center much less valuable since it will now be harder to turn them into center territory.]
;W[md]SQ[nc]C[O17 is better since it threatens to push into the top right corner. Black will probably defend the corner and then white can repeat the process by playing F17.]
;B[gc];W[gf]SQ[mj][jm]C[This looks like white is trying to connect the left side group with the upper side group.  Both are strong groups, however, so they don't need to be connected.

If white wants to use his center facing stones to make territory, then N10 or K7 is good.  White needs to cut off and kill the center black stone to make much center territory.]
;B[jb];W[jc]SQ[oc][lb]C[This doen't threaten to cut black and it doesn't block black out of white's potential territory around N18 so this move doesn't accomplish much.

M18 helps white make some territory.  P17 also helps make some territory.]
;B[ib];W[ic]TR[qq][jm][mj][oc][lb]SQ[jd][jc]C[This move makes an empty triangle for white.  Making an empty triangle is almost always a bad idea.  The exception is when you are making eyes.

M18 and P17 are still better moves locally.  Attacking white's center stone or invading the lower right corner are also good options.]
;B[nc];W[nd];B[mc];W[lc];B[lb];W[oc]TR[od]SQ[nc][mc]C[White should expect black to cut at P16 and the white stone at P17 will have to make life in the corner.  This move doesn't allow white to capture the black stones at O17 and N17.]
;B[kc];W[ld];B[pc];W[od];B[qf];W[qc]SQ[pb]C[Here white should expect black to extend to Q18 and force white to make life in the corner.]
;B[qb];W[rb];B[rc];W[pb];B[qa];W[qd];B[rd];W[pe];B[qe];W[pa]
;B[og]SQ[pe][od][nd][md][ld]C[Again, white has spent several moves building a wall on the top side and this black stone mostly neutralizes them.]
;W[nf];B[ng];W[mg];B[jg];W[mh]TR[ji]SQ[jg]C[At this point white is running out of corner and side territory options and needs some center territory.  White should attack the marked black stone.  The best way to attack the stone isn't to play up against it and start a contact fight, however.  It is better to play one space away from it, like K11.]
;B[mj];W[oi]SQ[qq][cc][jm]C[K7 is better.  Corner invasions at C17 or R3 are also reasonable options.]
;B[pi];W[oj];B[ni];W[nk];B[ll];W[om];B[qm];W[pk];B[qk];W[pl]
;B[ql]TR[ok][ol]SQ[sl][rl][sk][rk]C[The last two stones for each player have netted 4 points of territory for black and only 2 for white.  This is a good illustration of side territory being easier to capture than center territory.]
;W[no];B[nq];W[lp]SQ[kn]C[L6 is better for trying to cut off black's center stones.]
;B[kq];W[qq]SQ[nq]C[This is a bit late.  The black stone at O3 makes the corner invasion hard to pull off.]
;B[qp];W[lm]C[Don't bother invading the corner if you are not going to follow through.]
;B[km];W[ln];B[kn];W[ml];B[lk];W[mk];B[gn];W[fn];B[gm];W[hk]
;B[gk];W[pq];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[sr]SQ[oq]C[P3 is better.  Black will probably respond at P4 and then white can play O2.]
;B[or];W[oq];B[op];W[np];B[qr];W[mq];B[nr];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd]
;B[cb];W[bb]SQ[ce]C[C15 is better.  Black will probably play D15 to keep white from connecting with the center white stones.  White can then play C14 and make more eye space.]
;B[db];W[ba]C[This is the same pattern that white used in the lower right corner and those stones died.  Don't repeat a non-working strategy.]
;B[be];W[bd];B[ac];W[ad];B[ab];W[ce];B[bf];W[df]TR[bc][ac][ab]
[aa]SQ[ad][bd][ce][cd][cc][bb][ba]MA[cn][ji]C[White connects out and lives.

White just played 7 stones in the corner and got 4 points of territory and 2 prisoners.  That is a bit less than 1 point per stone played.  There are moves on the board worth more than 1 point that white could have played instead.  K11 and C6 are some examples.]
;B[gj];W[fk];B[fl];W[ek];B[gh];W[he];B[fe];W[ef];B[bo];W[dr]
;B[fr];W[bq]TR[bo]SQ[bp]C[B4 makes a bit more territory for white and threatens the black stone at B5]
