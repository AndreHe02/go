micha 11k+: 365 hi
 tentoumusi 9k+: Hi!

Hi micha, hope this review will help in the future :)];W[dd]
;B[pq]C[Already you can start to ask yourself some questions here. Many people use their handicap stones to play passively, hoping that the advantage will hold. Occupying the last corner isn't a bad play. But you could approach the white stone and start putting pressure on the second move of the game. 
Using your handicap stones for attack and pressure is a much better way to play, always; do not let white settle too easily when you can. These are general advices, a bit harder to use in a 2 stone games, but still.]
;W[qj];B[qo];W[qg];B[cf]C[Approaching by above would probably be better, as it helps your Q16 stone.]

[cj][pm][go];B[bm]C[im not sure if this is necessary
but since i figured im ahead on points and the middle is open ill play it safe

Your feelings were good, not your mind, it happens very often in go :D 
Playing on the second line so early in the game almost never is a good idea; Don't do this, and you'll see an improvment in your game. That's yose play, but you just finish the fuseki, and entering middle game. You have so much more to do! Look at the proposals. Some are a bit passive but solid moves, other are more aggressive, but all of them are bigger and let you keep the initiative. That's should be your priority here, since white has a weak group, and so dou you in the upper right.]
;W[rd]C[white is very nice to let you reinforce here whithout asking anything in return ^^
N16 could have been worrysome.];B[qc];W[rc];B[qf];W[rf];B[qe]
;W[re];B[pg];W[qh]LB[gd:D][cj:C][pm:A][go:B]C[So good for you. You juste made the mistake to keep pushing with 38 and 40 while it was no necessary anymore ;)
Again, other points are very big and you still have sente: use it!
In priority, I would lean towards A to reinforce and then attack at B. You could make a very big moyo towards center, if not kill the bottom left white stones.]
;B[ph];W[pi]LB[kh:A][go:B]C[If you really want to seal some territory here, I would suggest A. But B is still bigger. Cap your opponents, make them live so small or get out without eyes.]
;B[oi]LB[oj:A]C[Totaly useless here. No good opponent would reply at A, which is what you expected, I guess ;)]

(;W[lf]
(;B[pj]C[i think i should have played m17 instead of trying to force
luckily my opponent run out instead of peeping at L16];W[lh]

(;B[ld]C[So small. We, beginners, have a tendancy to only see the territory, the points we have, the ones we could have, the ones we could lose. And this move is typical of someone who don't want to lose what he claims to be "his" ;)
Try to focus less about a few points and consider the global situation.]
;W[me];B[mg]C[i played this peep to defent the cut at p12
is this exchange good for B?

It's not. You don't have to worry about P12 because you can take Q11 in sente. This peep is useless for you and connect white. It makes him a bit heavy, but that's not enough to compensate.]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[mc];W[le];B[kd];W[ih]C[And BAM! a play around D10 lose a lot of interest now.You cannot attack from here, just take a few points away from him.]
