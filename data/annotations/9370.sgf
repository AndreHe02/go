C[Hello dear reviewer.
I thought I am leading after the right side fight but eventually I lost.
I would like to focus on my joseki decisions and the critical moves in this game.
Thanks for your time

Rev: I don't know this joseki, but you played it correctly. However, Black finishes with two full corners and a potential attack while White doesn't have clear-cut territory yet. Not to my taste either. Maybe the avalanche was wrong, then.]
