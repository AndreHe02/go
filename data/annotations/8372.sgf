C[Hello, and thank you for reviewing this game!

This is my first GTL review, so I don't have specific things to ask about at this point. I make a lot of pretty basic reading mistakes and this is probably the single biggest problem with my game right now. I'm working on this (lots of life-and-death problems). I would really appreciate your help pointing out any areas for improvement that you see in this game. I've only been playnig for a short period of time, so I still have a lot to learn.

(I know I got killed in this game, but I *did* play this as a serious game. I would really appreciate your suggestions to help me become a stronger player.)

pz- hi-i'm pzykr; my comments will be preceeded with pz. under a different name i'm 9kyu on kgs. 
my first comment concerns your game file...you've already commented it up pretty intensely, which is ok, but all the variations you've added make it difficult to follow the real game... that makes it tough on a reviewer... you might suggest variations simply by giving the moves in your commentary (eg, WQ10 BQ12 WR8 BR9--totally random moves for illustrative purposes only:)

conventions: in my game files i usually refer to move numbers, which will be in lower case, so you should set your viwer to show all move numbers. if i refer to a place on the board (B12), i'll use caps---and it's the only time i use caps (grammar be damned:) except occasionally for emphasis. be aware, if you use smartgo to view your files---it thinks b12 (black's 12th move) is B12 (the place on the board)--very confusing. it will put a letter there... i love smartgo, but use multigo to view (and review) game files... multigo is free software. smartgo is available in a free version---but if you want all the pro games you gotta pay (tens of thousands of games! i paid...)]
;B[pp]C[pz- traditionally, this is considered by japanese players at least to be impolite: the lower-ranking player-usually black-as a courtesy, leaves this corner open for white. nearly always black plays first in the upper right. etiquette is important in go! one always greets one's opponent; one always thanks the opponent for the game when it's finished.]
;W[dd];B[pd];W[cp];B[ep];W[cn]C[pz- a little unusual; a two-space extension to B7 is ok, or a keima to C6, but this moves claims too little terri and puts zero pressure on the opponent--is just doesn't work hard enough and is inefficient. much more usual here is to attach at E5. have you read any books on the opening? highly recommended!]
;B[cq]
(;W[bq]C[It was probably not a good idea to induce Black to thicken his position with moves 9 and 11.]
;B[dq];W[dp];B[fp]C[pz- both sides are pretty much settled, but white's position is narrow and low, black has a good balance of stones on the 3rd and 4th line, a desirable balance.]
;W[cj]C[pz- again, third line: your position is squashed down on the left and vulnerable to invastion at C8. the idea of extending is the right idea, though, so you get points for that :)  maybe the ogeima at D9? you want to raise to the fourth line. the hoshi (star point) would also have been better than w12 (and maybe better than my suggested ogeima;)]
;B[fc]
(;W[cf]C[This response was okay. But I think it leaves me overconcentrated on the left while Black has a big, diffuse framework. A better response would be to pincer Black at H17.

pz- can't agree that this was an ok move---third line again!  D14 would have been fine, or maybe your suggested pincer.  another feasible pincer would have been the two space high pincer at J16. i like that one much better than your (third line-again!) H17.  you have to seek a balance between territory (third line) and power or influence (fourth line). (see ishida akira's excellent book "attack and defense" for a thorough discussion of the balance of territory and influence--very good)]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[ed];W[de];B[db];W[cb];B[br];W[pj]C[pz- tenuki (ignoring the position on the left and playing elsewhere) is fine, though it should cost you eventually.  finally! a fourth line stone. however... usually this splitting move is made on the _third_ line (R10) so you can extend two spaces on either side, depending on which side the opponent approaces from, and establish a base. you're inside the opponent's sphere of influence: you will need a stable base, which you cannot make from the fourth line. remember, the third line is the line of territory, the fourth line is the line of influence or power... (the second line is the line of defeat...i recently watched a game between 7 dans and correctly predicted the outcome when one of them had way too many second-line stones...)]
;B[qm]
(;W[pf]C[During the game, I thought that the sequence from 24-28 went well for me, but now looking back I think I could have done better by playing elsewhere. By playing here I gave up most of the upper and lower side of the board to Black.]
;B[nd];W[nf];B[kd];W[kf];B[qh]C[The sequence starting at 29 makes it pretty obvious that I don't know how to deal with an invasion.


pz- exactly the problem caused by not having played on the third line with w22 and extending two spaces with w24 (to R13)... your position is wide open to abuse!]
;W[ph];B[qj]C[pz- at this point, you can write off the right side, but you do have potential towards the center. if your w12 stone were on hoshi it would be stronger, but you do have the makings of a moyo (large territorial framework) here. unfortunately, moyo games are very difficult to make territory out of!  and of course, you will need to be able to make eyes in the center, without the assistance of the side, unless you can connect your right-center stones with your fairly stable group(s) on the left...

of course, the left is ripe for invasion at C12 and C8...]
(;W[qk]C[pz- what can you hope to accomplish with w32? you're going to get cross-cut, this stone will die, black will make thickness... it's all predictable!]
;B[pi];W[oi]C[pz-- oh my---look at all those cutting points! nice wedging-in move by black...]
;B[qi];W[pg];B[pk];W[oj];B[ql];W[rk]LB[jd:B][pl:A][jp:D][np:E]
[pq:C]C[I should have seen that the stone at R9 was lost, and played somewhere that I had a hope of a territorial gain. At this point I was letting my emotions about the last ten moves get in the way of reading the board well. Out of the marked letters I would think that A, D, or E would be my best possibilities. A is necessary to keep building a wall on the right side. D and E help me by starting to claim territory on the lower side.


pz- adding the stone at w40 isn't necessarily a bad thing. it's sacrificial for sure, but it's often done. it gives on a bit of leverage, creates a bit of aji (lingering potential). on the other hand, D and E both look like big, fat points! i think D particularly, to try to work with the moyo and get something going in the center---but that's a long row to hoe...

by the way, neither D nor E build territory---third line for terri!  to build the wall you could play P9, then A... but D is bigger and more urgent i think. imagine your opponent playing there first!]
;B[re]C[pz- this is the one variation that i comment on...]
(;W[ok]C[This was foolish. I waited a long time before making this move, but I wasn't *reading* the board as I did it.
(1) I missed the opportunity to catch Black in a ladder. See variation. Black would surely not have let this run all the way out but this would have been an opportunity to grab some territory and influence, and perhaps build a living group.
(2) It's obvious what Black's move response to my actual move will be and that that will prohibit me from continuing to build a wall on the right side.

pz- look at your variation for a comment on your ladder theory...
the only deficiency in w42 is that it wasn't played on the bottom, which is big. K4! you could have held P9 in reserve for a ko threat...]
;B[pl];W[rg];B[qg];W[qf];B[rj]C[pz- not sure why b didn't cut at S14. although, the aji from w40 makes the reading get pretty hairy after that cut...]
;W[om]C[Looking at actual moves 41-48, it seems like I am trying to control the whole board. I need to learn to make judgments about which Black groups I can leave on the board and which ones I need to attack.

pz-  w48 by itself is fine--building the moyo (though it does leave weakness at P8--why not play there instead?); but why abandon what you'd started on the right? why not connect at S14? leaving the cut for black gives him too much, seems to me...

and of course, there's still K4...

and playing a moyo game like you are---you ARE trying to control the whole board!--or at least the whole center. which, again, is a very difficult way to try to win a game!]
;B[ol]
(;W[nl]C[Here is a good example of where it would have been good to give up on stones. I could have built a wall across the center and induced Black to follow, definitely staking out a lot of White territory in the center -- so long as I had been willing to give up on connecting with the lone white stone at P7. In the actual gameplay, I relied on my habit of connecting unconnected stones. That really didn't give me a good result.]
;B[ml];W[op]C[pz- off-topic. you really can't afford to tenuki the clamp at b51. without looking ahead i can predict you're going to be punished for this... and i take back my comment that w48 was fine;) it really needed to be where b49 is, or else K4.]
;B[nk]C[pz- ouch! this is going to ruin your moyo, perhaps kill your stones, which only have a bit of eyespace around P12-and that's only one eye. w52 is going to really, really hurt!]
;W[nm]C[pz- abandon hope here-- protect your eyespace with something like O12... you're cut, you now have two groups to look after on the right: look after the bigger one first.]
;B[mj]
(;W[jp]C[Another foolish move. At this point I didn't really know what to do and the star point looked like a big open point so I took it. I now think I should have continued the attack on Black's lower right corner stone that I started at move 52. By just randomly playing here, I let Black get sente, and ended up following Black for many moves after this (though of course this is hardly because of this move alone).

pz- NOT a foolish move. your best move in a long time, imho. kept your opponent from getting this last big point on the board. and it has some hope of working with the nearly hopeless, floating stones around w54...]
;B[nh]C[pz- but alas, your opponent does seize the vital point in your position... you are in big trouble! your eyespace is destroyed.  your only hope, it seems to me, is in surrounding and killing those impudent cutting stones b51-b57.  could lead to an exciting semeai (capturing race).  if i remember correctly from my initial run-though of your game, it just leads to inglorious death for w.....]
(;W[mg]C[Neither this nor the following move at 60 is an effective way to limit Black's outward movement. But it's really hard for me to see what *would* be an effective play here. The variation I've given is the best I can see but there are lots of ways Black can slip out.


pz- only move on the board is P12! you have NO choice! MUST!!!]
;B[oh]C[pz- that's why :( 

bang, bang, you're dead. game is essentially over now.


as a matter of fact, this will be my last comment. i know there are a lot more moves, but let's look at the board. you have some terri on the left---squashed-down, small terri. your opponent owns the top and the right. your center is shot. now that you no longer have a center moyo, the K4 stone would be better placed at L3, to make a stable base. w52 is in an awkward spot. your stones are scattered and do not coordinate well with each other.  no one would think badly of you for resigning right now... at least no one with any kind of judgement of the game.

i hope you won't feel resentful because i ignored most of your variations (except the busted ladder) or didn't comment on the rest of what's clearly a lost cause...

i appreciate the opportunity to review this game: it helps me with my own game to do these reviews--i only hope you get as much out of the review as i did!

i wish you much improvement and many happy games!

pzykr--aka jerry hill];W[mi]C[Now I begin making a series of really bad moves.]
;B[mh];W[lh]C[Starting here I become way too focused on capturing the group of three black stones. As it grows much larger, I should give up on it, but for the next twenty moves I keep trying (and failing) to capture it. All wasted moves.]

(;W[le]C[I could have used the beginning I have with moves 70 and 71 to try and build a wall to firm up some White territory.]
;B[me];W[lj];B[oq]C[I had many opportunities to develop this area to White's advantage that I missed because I was too focused on capturing the black group in the center of the board.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[jh];B[ji];W[jj]C[Moves 80 and 82 are pure mental  fatigue from chasing down and then giving up on the black group.]
;B[ii];W[ki];B[kj];W[jk]C[Over the next several moves (84, 88, 90, 92) I try to build a wall to limit Black's growth.

But this is the third time I've tried to build a wall to stop Black. I wonder if I'm trying to build walls too much, or if I don't really understand how they work, since it looks like most of the time when I try to build them I fail (except against very weak opponents). In retrospect it looks like I want to build walls in order to be able to claim territory without really having to fight for it. But probably that's a bad mentality.]

;W[hk]LB[gc:E][nc:B][pc:C][qc:D][he:A][gp:F]C[This move is bad - a reaction to the surprise of the capture on the previous move. There are many better places to play. I think A or F would probably have allowed for the best territorial gains.]
;B[ff];W[jj]MA[ih][hi][ki][gj][ij][jk][jl][ll][lm][kn]C[I played here because I thought I might be able to kill the group. That was very stupid. I would need all of the marked points to kill the group, and anyway Black would only need to play at L11 to assure life for the group.]
(;B[ch]C[One of the successes from this game was that I killed the invading black group. But I can't help thinking that this was a terribly inefficient and slow way to do it. Was there a better way to play here?]

Since Black made territory on so much of the center of the board I thought that my only possible way of catching up was to make territory along the top and bottom side of the board. But this was fruitless and again wasted many moves.]

(;W[js]C[A wasted move. There's no real hope of capturing any black group in the vicinity. The most promising alternative move that I can see (see variation) makes this clear.]
;B[fk];W[mn];B[po];W[jr];B[ks]
(;W[pc]C[I tried to invade here. But if I had tried to solidify the small white group just under line 15, I might have been able to capture a group and change the balance of territory in the center.

I think this would probably not have worked. At any point, Black would only have had to play at L11 in order to stymie the capture. So such a capture would depend on Black making a reading error.

What I really need to think about in the last twenty moves is: how could I have made a successful invasion?]
;B[oc]
(;W[pb]C[This variation is more successful than what I actually did, but it sure doesn't gain much territory. Perhaps this is a lesson in being realistic about what an invasion can accomplish. The invasion does more to destroy the opponent's territory than to really gain territory of my own.]
