C[tsjanl: Dear reviewer,

Thank you for having a look at this game. I think I, playing white, made some strategical errors in the fuseki and afterwards didn't know how to make good use of the position. From move 106 until 143 (when I resigned), my play became bad, because I started panicking, not knowing what to do. I am curious to know I was right in thinking around move 100 that things were going wrong, or that there still were possibilities.

Jan-Willem Swane


Hello

I'll try to answer your questions the best I can.

I'll also provide comments for Black, since I can see there are some hints around.

Hope this helps

Don't hesitate to come back if questions arise.

C[A pincer by Black here is overplay.
A calm game would require "a"

The variation next shows what to expect from this line of play]

(;W[qq]C[better follow the variation. R3 will get you enclosed and black will be happy]
;B[pq]C[tsjanl: Black seems to choose the wrong direction.

R : I would agree];W[qp];B[qo]C[tsjanl: According to Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, this is a mistake.]

(;W[ro]TR[po]LB[qr:A]C[tsjanl: A should be better, preparing the cut at the triangle.]
;B[qn];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[jd]LB[cj:B][iq:A]C[tsjanl: Is this the right moment to tenuki? And is it the good place? I would like to play around j3 to make blacks wall ineffective, but was afraid of a move around f3.


K16 or O17 are the only moves here.

"A" is of no value, since it has no effect on Black (too solid)

"B" is dangerous, because in this case, black will play at K16 (or E17), and White will be restricted to the left side.]
;B[rn];W[sp];B[dj]C[tsjanl: Or was this the place to play 18?

R : This has been answered
it is a normal move for black];W[cm]MA[cf][ch]LB[cl:A][cn:B]
C[tsjanl: I didn't know if from which site I should play


Rather play upper side (double winged corner). 

Also, from this side, this move is either too relaxed (rather at "A", more agressive), or too loose ("B", protects the corner).]
;B[cq]C[This is the refutation of C7 :

- if you defend at C4, C7 is too close
- if D3, your wall will be facing the black, and thus being of little value]
;W[cp]C[tsjanl: Afterwards I think this direction. Or should I have played around c13 to pressure the lone black stone?

No, you can't ignore C3 yet.
This is sente on C3.
Finish the local exchange before attacking D10];B[dq];W[eq]

C[tsjanl: Now I have build a wall, I think I should pressure d10 from above before Black plays d13.


that may be too late];B[dg];W[ek]MA[fd][nc]C[no.
The upper side needs to be completed.

In any case : don't try to build territory with you walls. Use them to crush your opponent onto ...]
;B[gd];W[fe]C[tsjanl: Was it better to lean against the strong group?

This is okay, it separates black];B[id];W[jc]MA[ic]C[J17 better]

very big at this stage];W[cd];B[de];W[ee];B[bd];W[bc];B[ad]
MA[ih]C[bad : gote.

the sente move is A15 (because of A17 follow up).

There is no need to answer locally anyway. Center is bigger.]

(;W[bb]C[yuck !

You lose 2 or 3 point in gote !];B[cl];W[dm]C[bad : gote

D8 is sente];B[bl];W[fc]MA[ih][mp][nj][no]C[slow.

Now you should use your nice centre influence to reduce B right side, or attack J16 (even better)]
;B[ih]C[tsjanl: That was the place I wanted to play afterwards. Should I have played f17 here letting Black make a base in exchange for influence?

Black F17 is of very little use for him (not a base in any case), because of K17 which peeps under the black shape ...]
;W[ij];B[jf];W[kf];B[jh];W[li]C[yes];B[ni];W[lo]C[may be too early.
The fight on top is not finished];B[np];W[mp];B[mq];W[no];B[op]
;W[po]MA[kj][ml]C[Overplay. 
There is very little chace you can kill either of B shapes ...

L10 much more valuable, for instance.];B[pn];W[oo];B[nr];W[kp]
C[tsja: Better at k4 I guess.

or H2 locally.
But top is more important];B[ge];W[gf];B[hf];W[nj]MA[hg]C[tsjanl: I think I should have sealed black in (k10 perhaps?).

Black is not yet alive.
H13 is required first.

Locally your move is ok];B[oj];W[mj];B[ol];W[ml];B[jj]
(;W[ji]C[tsjanl: This is the source of the disaster. After this move my playing became very bad. It happens often to me when I come under pression. What would have been a good strategie in this position?


Use your strenght ...

You have a magnificent wall underneath.
Push black towards it. 
B has only 1 eye at this stage

The problem is : if B survives, he will win the game because he is ahead on territory.]

Usually, when you make a kikashi (forcing move), you sacrifice the stone you used.

;W[oi];B[pi];W[oh];B[of]C[tsjanl: And I resigned


I summary :

You lost because you played a couple of small moves that gave sente to black (B18, D7, L4 and the losing move being probably F17), and were away from the scene (centre). Also, B was successfull in building on the left and right side, which would have made a game balanced if W had concentrated on the centre.


What White could have done to compensate would have been to pressure the weak B centre group and build its own territorry in the centre.]
