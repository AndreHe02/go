R10 stone.];B[qe]C[In this situation, though, R15 is right, because you're the one at the middle star

white in at R4, how far could he go?];B[dr];W[er];B[ds]C[Having to finish this up in gote (losing the move) is not good. There are still bigger
things to be played, as can be seen from white's next few plays in the center.

White can play it to seki by playing A3, or black can by playing A4.
Currently, you're right, it's undecided. Ko fights are not for the faint at heart,
though.];B[ie]C[> The lower left is seki (?) - but either of us could turn it into a ko fight.

Black doesn't have very much in the way of threats. As you realized, to be effective,
ko threats must be on a par with the size of the ko. Black doesn't have much like that.]
;W[oo];B[ak]C[> Here I'm (incorrectly) crowding the d5 group, to create a ko threat
