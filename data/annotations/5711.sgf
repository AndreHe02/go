C[Alex: Hi, thanks for reviewing this game.  I was playing black.  I think I'd like some help with fuseki and direction of play: I thought I already had a losing position by move 50.  Any other comments you can make are very welcome.

-----

Hi! I am not good at the fuseki myself, but may be I can suggest some moves and ideas which are helpful.]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[ec];W[dp];B[cn];W[cd];B[ch]LB[fq:A]C[Alex: I'm not sure if this was a good idea.  Maybe 'A' (F3) was better?

-----

I would have played A... Your move looks a little bit slack?!]
;W[de];B[gd]LB[hc:C][dk:B][fq:A]C[Alex: Again I wondered if 'a' (F3) or 'b' (D9) would be better here.

-----

I would have played at C; if White continues like he did in the game, you could leave the position at the top as it ist and defend at B instead.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[db];B[kc];W[dk]LB[eh:A][fk:F][hk:G][en:B][gn:D]
[fp:C][hp:E]C[Now you played at A, but I don't have a good feeling about it, because it's hard to see how it can interact with the other black stones. If you want to play there, maybe you shout exchange B to D first?! If then White F, you can attack with G.]
;B[eh];W[dn];B[do];W[eo];B[co];W[cp]LB[dl:C][dm:A][en:B]C[Alex: I think this is reasonable, but I wasn't sure what to do next.

-----

You played A now, but I feel very uneasy about giving White such a nice connection as B...

Did you consider C instead? I can't gaurantee it works, but the variations look interesting.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[cl];W[em];B[ck]TR[eh]C[Now, the marked stone ist in a strange place.]
;W[fq];B[kq]LB[iq:A][mq:B]C[Now white approaches from his strong side, at A... Normally you would expect B?!]
;W[iq]LB[mq:A];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[pn]LB[pj:B][ko:A]TR[eh]C[Alex: Do I need to defend now, or should I go somewhere else?

-----

Your move, A, looks very slow to me. I would prefer B instead; if you can develop a moyo somewhere at the top, maybe it's possible to make the marked stone work?!]
;B[ko];W[od]LB[oc:A][pf:B]C[Alex: What is the best way to respond?  I considered 'A' (P17), but I thought white could get a good result with the avalanche joseki.  What about 'B' (Q14)?

-----

B looks quite normal. The right side is still open, so developing in this direction is natural, no?!]
;B[pc]LB[oc:A][pe:B]C[Noe White plays at A, another unusal move which makes his stones heavy; I think B is the normal move.]
;W[oc];B[pe];W[kd]LB[lc:A][jd:B]TR[eh]SQ[db]C[Alex: This move surprised me.  I wanted to reply at 'A' (M17), but I was worried that after white 'B' (K16) my stones at the left would become weak.

-----

I don't think the stones on the left could face any real danger - here the marked stone is sure helpful.

Moreover, concentrating on the top is no good idea for Black because the marked white stones stops Black from making territory there.

So, I think A would have been not that bad an idea...];B[jc]
;W[jd]LB[id:A][ld:B]C[Now you played A, but B, playing away from your strong stones, looks better to me.]
;B[id];W[ld];B[qi];W[lc]LB[ie:A][ql:B]C[I can't see the point of your next move at A. The stones there are safe, and the center is not interesting right now. I would prefer B.]
;B[ie];W[qk];B[qq]C[Alex: This seemed like a good idea at the time, but now I'm not so sure.  I was happy that white spent two moves to answer this.

-----

Invading here feels good.];W[or]LB[oi:A][qm:B]C[A is strange now - You should try to live in the lower right. You can also consider B here, I think]
;B[oi];W[qp];B[ok]TR[ie][eh][oi][ko]C[Now you have played five stones (the marked ones) facing the center, but they aren't working verry effective...]
;W[ql]LB[mb:A][nm:B]C[Alex: OK, here is the big question.  I think white has about 55 points of secure territory plus komi, and black only has about 50, no komi--but there is some potential in the centre.  Is this still an even position, or is white clearly ahead?  What is the best way to continue?

(My next move was a horrible mistake!)

-----

Insread of A (your move) B looks logical, but I am not too confdent about the black position, too...]
;B[mb];W[pb];B[qb];W[lb];B[ob];W[nb];B[pa];W[mc]LB[el:A][nm:B]
C[A at the left side doesn't work, I think, so may be Black should still play at B.]
;B[el];W[dl];B[cm];W[dj];B[cj];W[fj];B[fl];W[di];B[hl];W[dh]
;B[bg];W[dg];B[hp]LB[hj:B][hq:A]C[Alex: This didn't work out as I expected.  Is there a better move in this area?

-----

You can exchange this stone against White A, but then B looks right...]
;W[hq];B[ip];W[jp];B[jq];W[jo];B[in];W[jn]LB[im:B][hn:A]C[Your move at A looks passive. Doesn't B work?! It fights much stronger against the three white stones.]
;B[hn];W[kp];B[lq];W[gp]LB[jl:B][lm:A]C[?! Against which thread White defends here?

Vour next move shold be at B, not at A ( which forces White to cut through the black positions).]
;B[lm];W[jl];B[hj];W[lo];B[km];W[jm];B[nn];W[jj];B[jh]LB[hh:A]
[ii:B]C[Alex: I think this was another mistake; the stones on the left are too weak to play this way.  What do you think about 'A' (H12) instead?

-----

Yes, Black isn't strong enough for a move like this. But instead of A, I would prefer, which also azttecks the white stones.]
;W[ii];B[gi];W[ih];B[gg];W[jg]C[Alex: I think it is hopeless for black now.  You don't need to look at the rest of the game, unless you're really interested.  Thanks for reviewing.

-----

I'll add only a few more comments from here on.];B[kh];W[kg]
;B[ig];W[lk];B[lh];W[nl];B[ol];W[nm];B[om];W[mn];B[on];W[oo]
;B[no];W[nj]LB[oj:A][nk:B]C[Instead of A, you should try B.]
;B[oj];W[ic];B[hc];W[ib];B[hb];W[jb];B[ea]LB[be:A][rj:B][bp:C]
C[?! Quite small. A, B, C are all bigger.];W[eb];B[fb];W[gk]
;B[hk];W[gm];B[hm];W[gl]LB[be:A][rj:B]C[Also not too big. White makes  seven points or so. A is bigger, B also.]
;B[kn]TR[nl]C[Alex: Just looking for a place to resign!

-----

You should have looked for such a place some moves before (may be after the marked stone), when the position was still somewhat unsettled ;)]
;W[nk];B[kk];W[jk];B[lj];W[kl];B[mk];W[ll]TR[ko]SQ[eh]C[Alex: This is where I resigned.

-----

Well, how to sum up this game? You played a move which was hard to use (the squared one), and one very slow (the triangled one), and after that, Black had a difficult game, I think.

Then you let White settle his stones at the top witout gaining anything as compensation, and from there on, White was in the driver seat.

Ok, let me end the review here.

Good luck with your next games!])
