  Johnnie 5k*: I do that sometimes
  Johnnie 5k*: wta's you handle?];W[qd];B[cp]C[
  hershoff 5k*: hershoff
  Johnnie 5k*: I'm agamemnon :)];W[dc];B[ip]C[B5. The high Chinese Fuseki - as difficult as the San Ren Sei for White to counter.]
;W[qn];B[ql];W[qq]C[W8. Another possibility is to jump out at P7 to induce B O4, flattening the B formation, but the text is certainly reasonable.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[qr];B[pn];W[rn];B[pr]C[B15. Joseki is at O8. The text leaves an important flaw in the B position for W to exploit at the appropriate moment.]
;W[pm]C[W16. This is what W has to look forward to as a result of B15, but to play it immediately is premature!   Because the Chinese Fuseki leaves one more space between B5 and the wallhe has just built than the San Ren Sei, instead, White might try something like L4 now to neutralize the B moyo! Lacking the Joseki stone at P8, there is no way to prevent something like BK6, WM6, BL8, WM8 or N8, although doing even this immediately might easily prove an error if W's subsequent play isn't adequate. Another possibility is for White to begin with L5 instead of 4, and E4 or F4 are also feasible.   The problem with all of these immediate efforts to reduce the B moyo are that B can get very strong on the outside, and this can readily swing the rest of the game in his favor. Exactly what is best in this possition is a subject far beyond my modest ability to determine accurately, but  given the many errors that players at both your and my level commit, perhaps the immediate invasion at L4 isn't a bad idea here after all.]
;B[qm];W[om];B[pk]C[B19. To my (non-definitive) eye, too slow. At R11 builds a base quickly, and leaves B freer to attack the weak W stones while concentrating on securing his moyo. Also feasible is N6 begin to secure the moyo, because then the fight between the 2 weak groups is still fair, with no chance for a kill by either. Of course, W will then squeeze at R11 to begin to make his own territory on the right, but that's Go! You've always got to give something unless your opponent blunders.]
;W[mm];B[mo]C[B21. The moyo is already  one line smaller, and W has Sente with which to attack! This tells me that B19 was indeed too slow.]
;W[ep]C[W22. Misses the point! In too much of a hurry to destroy the B moyo! Instead, R11 or Q11 now takes full advantage of B's ignoring the Joseki play at B15.]
;B[dn]C[B23. With the squeeze play of B5 already in place, the attachment at E3 seems more natural. This plays into W's hands, and makes his invasion painless.]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[dq];B[br];W[gq];B[iq]C[B29. At H2 instead is stronger.];W
[co]C[W30. Unnecessary, and Aji Keshi. The simple G5 is both more natural and far better.]
;B[do];W[dp];B[bp];W[fn]C[W34. Better at G5.];B[nk]C[B35. Bad, because W20 is already a step ahead. Much better would be R13, to stabilize the B stones while securing some territory. After that, B can attack the W stones at leisure, and with relative impunity.]
;W[ln];B[lo]C[W36. Strengthening in sente, but also forcing B to essentially turn the moyo into territory. This is therefore a big loss which should only be undertaken if W is certain that he will obtain adequate compensation in return.]
;W[jm]C[W38. Misses the point. These W stones are safe for the moment, and R11 now would not only begin to make W territory but also attack the still unsettled B stones. In any event, the text also opens up the potential for a later very dangerous splitting play!]
;B[qg]C[B39.  With this key play, B now stands much better.];W[od]C[W40. Too slow. Now that an invasion of teh B territory is no longer possible, W should first strenghten himself via K5 to induce B K4, then H2 to induce B J2.  In any event, considering only theupper right corner P17 or O17 are both better than the text, which leaves open the annoying B probe of  N17 for later.]
;B[de]C[
  hershoff 5k*: whats your rating there ?

B41. A big Fuseki play, to be sure, but in too much of a hurry in this position. Instead, B can attack in Sente via O6, then M8. This could be followed by the nasty splitting play of H6, although this last is better held in abeyance for a while.]
;W[dh]C[W42. At C13 is better.
  Johnnie 5k*: 1800+ and yours ?];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[bb]C[B47. At C13 not only secures the B stones, but is Sente. The text is too slow and small now, since if B at C13 W certainly can't ignore it to play in the corner.]
;W[ba];B[ab];W[gd]C[W50. too slow. The W stones can't be killed, so w has time for C8 to induce B's C7, then follow with C14, not only attacking the B upper left stones but simultaneously securing W42 and assuring some territory on the left side. Instead, as the game actually went B's left side and the weakness of W42 were very bad for W.]
;B[mc]C[B51. Misses the key point! There is no way that W can consolidate the upper side in less than 2 plays, and C10 now is HUGE for B.]
;W[kc]C[
  hershoff 5k*: about 1350 :-)
  Johnnie 5k*: :)];B[me]C[
  srobi 11k*: black is a strong player, no?];W[oc]C[W54. Bad! Instead, W should come out at P14.]
;B[of]C[B55. This is too good for B for W to have allowed!];W[qf];B[pf]
;W[qe]C[W58. Very bad shape!!!! The descent to S14 is the only move!];B
[rg]C[B59. Now W is undercut instead of the other way around!];W[mk]C[
  letsgo 6k*: both are pretty good so far

W60. Obviously trying to strengthen his weak group, but once again inducing B to consolidate a large territory. In any event, the correct focus of play now is the left side! As noted earlier, at C8 is Sente (because of the threat to rescue W30), and after B defends W can follow with C14, also in Sente, to steal much of the left side and keep W in the game.]
;B[nl];W[nm];B[mj];W[lk];B[ck]C[B65. At C10 is even stronger, but this is the right idea. Now B is clearly not only in the lead, but also in control.]
;W[ld];B[md];W[ne];B[nf]C[W66,68. What these moves accomplish escapes me. The B upper right is completely solid, so the chances of  W being able to catch the B51,67 stones approaches zero.]
;W[mf];B[le]C[B71. Correct.];W[mg];B[je]C[B73. At M12 instead is far more promising, although B should win via the text as well.]
;W[kg];B[jc];W[ke];B[kf];W[jd];B[id];W[jf];B[kd];W[lf];B[if];W[ke];B[lc]
C[B85. This result is more than good enough for B.];W[ig];B[hf];W[hb]C[W88. W could just as well resign right now.]
;B[nh]C[B 89. Safe, and good enough in this position.];W[mh];B[mi];W[li]
;B[lj];W[ki];B[kj];W[kk]C[W96. Wrong! At K11 is necessary. W60, 64 are unimportant stones, and can be sacrificed if necessary.]
;B[jj];W[ji];B[ij]C[
  letsgo 6k*: w wrong

B99. Much better at H11, threatening to swallow up W42 on a huge scale!]
;W[jo]C[W100. Too little, too late, albeit Sente.];B[kp];W[ko]C[
  srobi 11k*: allowing black to get too thick in center ?];B[hn]C[
  letsgo 6k*: i think w should block w L10

B103. The splitting attack I spoke of way back on move W38.];W[go];B[io]
C[
  letsgo 6k*: b L10

B105.  Locally large, but hardly on a scale comparable with H13, threatening to capture W42 on  HUGE scale! (Note that this would also initiate nasty threats of capturing W76, followed by the atari on 4 stones at M12 . Although W can still live here after the capture of W76 if he plays correctly, his game is nevertheless hopelessly lost).]
;W[in];B[im];W[jn];B[ho];W[il];B[hg]C[B111.  At this point, W can resign without jeopardizing his chances!]
;W[ih]C[
  letsgo 6k*: w 3 week groups now];B[hm]C[
  srobi 11k*: left is starting to get huge
  letsgo 6k*: yes   B113. Why bother??? The simple  C13 puts the game beyond W's retrieval.]
;W[cj];B[bk]C[B115.  At D10 is much better.];W[dk];B[km]C[
  letsgo 6k*: fatal];W[jl];B[hl];W[hk];B[ik];W[hj];B[jp]C[B123. Totally unnecessary. W has no continuation here because of the high liberty count of the B5 et al string. Instead, C13 puts the game away with no risk.]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[ol];B[nj]C[B127. O.K., but at P11 instead is far superior because the atari on 2 stones still leaves W with a dead shape.]
;W[ng];B[oh];W[og];B[ph]C[B131. Very safe, and certainly good enough in this position, but the simple connection at Q13 leaves W with no continuation.]
;W[pg];B[cg]C[B133. Better late than never.];W[bh];B[bg]C[B135. Simpler to just push in at C12, but the game is already over so all that B has to do from now on is not to make any serious blunders.]
;W[bj];B[dl];W[ek];B[el];W[cr]C[W140. This is an endgame move which only makes sense if W is close. In reality, W should resign.]
;B[cn]C[B141. Why?? W has no continuation here. Instead, E11 is the key point, but B is taking absolutely no chances of missing anything and perhaps that's really best after all.]
;W[hr];B[ir];W[ch];B[fr]C[B143. Not necessary!  Just finish the game off with O18, P18, P19, Q19, O19, R18, and then block at T7.]
;W[er];B[gr];W[fq];B[hq];W[fs];B[hs];W[gp];B[ds];W[cs];B[es];W[dr];B[dj]
C[B137. Is B short of time? That's what this looks like, and if so It's all right. Otherwise, it's ridiculous. Just finish the game off as noted earlier.]
;W[ej];B[sd];W[rd];B[se];W[sc];B[sf];W[rb];B[rm];W[qo];B[qs];W[rs];B[sr]
C[B169. Why?? Just connect, and rack up the win. Having fun, I guess, but taking unnecessary chances at the last possible moment.]
;W[rr];B[sq];W[sp];B[so];W[sn];B[rp];W[rq]C[
  srobi 11k*: seki?   W176. Now, W is (or at least should be) alive.];B
[ps];W[ss]C[W178. The wrong atari! At S5 lives with territory.];B[sm];W
[sp];B[sq]C[
  srobi 11k*: nope    letsgo 6k*: good!   B181. Now W is dead! (He will be forced to capture the dead "5 in an axe head" shape.)]
