C[Robert123 [13k\]: hi gg

Hi Marcus. My name's Jonathan and I will be reviewing your game. The game was fairly balanced most of the way through, though there were a few specific places where you could have saved some points or gained a little advantage. I think the main lesson from this game is to ask yourself before every move: is this the best move? I'll try to point that out as we go along and hopefully it will make sense.]
;B[pd]C[Unicycle [13k\]: hi, u2];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]SQ[cc][dc]
[ec][cd][dd][ed][ce][de][ee]C[This move is ok if you have a specific strategy in mind, but it's usually better to play in an open corner.]
(;B[mp]C[Joseki move is O4. The large knight's move is weakly connected and gives white the opportunity to make black look bad just by playing normal moves. For example, see the variation. 

Another thought: since black played a loose move, white is not under attack and can consider playing somewhere else (hint: the empty corner!).]
(;W[ql];B[qg]
(;W[qi]C[Can black hurt you if don't play here? The empty corner is bigger.]
;B[mc]
(;W[ec]C[Good! You found the right area of the board, but let's take a closer look. By playing here, you are declaring that you want to control the top of the board rather than the left (see variations to see what I mean), but black is already encroaching on that area with n17. D16 would be better, or at least d17.]
;B[cd];W[cj]C[Ok.];B[dg]C[This leaves weakness that you can probe later. C13 would be more solid.]
;W[hc]C[Good. Black has influence on both sides, so forming a solid base is a good idea.]
;B[fq]
(;W[eq]C[This is a bad mistake. This move does not really help white and forces black to become stronger. Black has a big hole between F3 and N4, but this move lets Black surround that space a bit more.

I'm not sure what the best move would be in this situation, but there are several possibilities. You could simply link to c10 or try a pincer. (see variations).]
;B[fp]C[See how much stronger black looks now at the bottom?]
(;W[do]C[Oh boy, this doesn't help either. W has a similar hole between d4 and C10, so w needs to use this move to link the two stones together a little better.]
;B[ip]TR[do][fp][eq]C[Do you see how black F4 and J4 are doing more work than white E3 and D4? Black got an advantage here, all because of E3.]

;W[dj];B[dh];W[ci];B[en];W[fr];B[gr];W[es];B[hq]C[Ok, left side got a little messy, but your groups are alive and everything's settled. So, let's see how things stand on the board. Black has a big chunk of territory on the bottom, but top right has a huge weakness at R17 and the upper left group is limited too (imagine a white stone at C18). All of white's groups are fairly stable, but there isn't too much room to grow, which means you have to focus on limiting black's group and chip away at his weaknesses.]
;W[fj]C[I'd prefer G10, but this is a good idea: it keeps black from expanding his bottom group.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp];W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq];W[kp]
;B[ko];W[lo];B[lp];W[mo];B[jo];W[kq]C[why play L3? you could use this move as a ko threat later, so don't waste it by playing now.]
;B[mq];W[qc]C[Great! White's groups on either side are strong and ready to support the invasion.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]
(;W[rd]C[force first. You get very lucky with this sequence; black should have killed.]
;B[qb];W[rb]

(;W[ob]C[be careful! s16 stones are in atari and both players missed it!]
(;B[nc];W[qa];B[sc];W[nb];B[mb];W[oc];B[od];W[sb];B[sf]
(;W[rc]C[Was this the biggest move on the board? Do you have to play it at all? What if you don't? 

This was a chance for you to take a big point on the board and try to take the lead. It's even possible to cut black's group, which will make the game very hard for him.

See the variations.];B[ne];W[oi];B[ng];W[ke];B[kg]

(;W[ml]C[think bigger];B[kl]
(;W[lm]C[is this necessary?];B[km];W[hf];B[ig];W[hg];B[hh]
(;W[ff]C[what are you trying to accomplish? If you want to surround territory on the top, then this stone would be better at e15. If you want to keep the black left group separated, then play more strongly at g15.]
;B[gh]
(;W[fg]C[again, is this the best move? What does it accomplish? You can still cut off black's left group.]

(;W[jk]C[Before playing all of these stones, which just gave black extra points, try to read it out in your head and figure out what will happen. You still have an interesting move here if you look around.]

(;W[kb];B[me];W[pg];B[ph];W[pe];B[qf];W[pf]C[Take an extra few seconds to think before playing your move. Count the liberties: the three white stones only have three liberties, same as black, so black will win the race since it's his move.]
;B[og];W[oh]
(;B[oe];W[pi];B[of];W[qh]TR[db][ag]C[There are bigger moves elsewhere. This is only worth one point.]
;B[pg]TR[db]C[You got lucky again. Since, this stone is only work 1 point, black should have played somewhere else.]

[is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Again, for recap: always ask yourself "is this the best move?" and try to read out at least a couple of moves in your head before playing a stone. If you can't read far enough to see how a move will turn out, then go ahead and play it (Go is just a game, after all), but at least try. Your reading will improve with more practice. 20 points isn't that much, really, so you were never out of this game. Always look for opportunities to play somewhere else and take a big a point, and eventually you'll start to pull ahead of your opponents. If you have any more questions, feel free to track me down. (I play as appleseeds on KGS, though I've been really busy lately have haven't played online for a while.) Best wishes, and enjoy playing go!]
