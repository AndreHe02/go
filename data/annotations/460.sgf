G15 is inconsistant as it damages the stones you just decided to save.  If you want to put pressure on b stones, perhaps H16 would be better. But lower left seems more urgent C5 looks reasonable.  White will need to worry about base because of G12 group.]

A somewhat important stone, but more important to get eye space for white top group. So w J17 looks reasonable. B cannot capture H14 immediately]

Ok, if try to kill this is good move.  Should also consider forcing b to live small,  maybe P13.  This would be more consistant with the rest of your stones, if b comes into center, M14 group not doing much]
