As b, I would prefer to break out at Q14 than be hemmed in at R15.

(I couldn't figure out how to add a letter "a" at Q14.  I'm using winmgt
and I chose "edit" and then "add others" then "letter".  But when I clicked
on Q14, it still put a stone down instead of a letter.  How do I do it ?]

now that w made thickness at top, maybe moving the K17 stone out to use the
thickness to attack the L16 b stones would be better use of the thickness
than Q7.];B[jd];W[cj];B[jq];W[gq];B[mq];W[cn];B[cm];W[dn];B[ch]

maybe w connect at R13 better, then b T13 and w r11 to maintain thickness]
;B[qg];W[qh];B[pg];W[ph];B[og];W[oh]C[
what if w ataried once at P14 instead of P12 and then ataried at S11.  now
all w stones would be keeping the b P12 group under attack]
