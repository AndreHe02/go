C[<W> Hi, I am the reviewer of this game, W aka Woldsom (on KGS). I will mark my comments like this.


I'm white.I lost by 1.5 because of a mistake in the end game.In the middle game I should have done better.Some of my opponent's moves confused me. Since I am used to playing the san-ren-sei, I am not particularly good with white. Maybe you could give me additional advice on how to train too?

<W> Practice practice practice. If possible, get a friend around your own level or higher to play against you playing the moves you are most unsure of how to counter.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[cf];W[di];B[fc]
(;W[cc]C[<W> This seems like a mistake to me. Not only do you want to get out to the center here, doing so would probably leave black with a wasted move in the area.]
;B[ee];W[dn];B[ci]C[I think that my opponent's tsuke should have been played around c8-c9.


<W> C11 is certainly too kind; giving you the choice between extra strength and territory, and a favourble fight.]

(;W[cj]C[<W> This is probably the better solution, though I would fret a bit about the top corner stones.]
;B[ch];W[dk];B[oq];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj];B[qj]C[This move here is a new experience.Its like move 11 but my stones aren't as strong. I'm not sure how to fight it.

<W> You handled it well; this kind of move is dual-purpose, but give you a choice of what to give up.]
;W[qi];B[qk];W[ph];B[pm]
(;W[fq]C[<W> This is perhaps a bit too close. I am not sure you're even protecting the corner fully (and if you're not sure on the continuations, you can't rely on it), and H3 (for instance) gains you more influence AND potential territory.]

(;B[jq];W[jc];B[qe];W[rf];B[rd];W[hc]
(;B[kc];W[kd];B[lc];W[jf];B[jo];W[fd]C[<W> Black should probably have closed you in here, instead of playing on the right.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[eb];W[dc];B[gc];W[gd];B[hd]
(;W[gf]C[<W> This does not work, black has G15, the correct move if you want to get out at once is F14.]
;B[ic];W[he];B[hb];W[de];B[ff]C[<W> Black wants to exploit the throw-in at G15, but this gives you the opportunity to play J16, as answering it just got temporarilly hotter for black.]

(;W[ef]C[I was trying to capture my opponent's stones here when I realized that he could play an atari.

<W> At least it avoids the G15 throw-in that would secure black here.]
;B[fe];W[ge];B[fg];W[eg];B[eh];W[dh];B[gh];W[ce]C[<W> Bad shape here, I would play B15 or just D13.]
;B[ie];W[if];B[je];W[ii]C[<W> Good timing here.];B[gj];W[ke]
;B[jb]C[<W> Connecting here at K16 is fairly problem-free, black doesn't want to give you the strenght of capturing K15, and you can connect L14 afterwards.]

(;W[kf];B[ei];W[cg];B[ej];W[dj];B[hg]C[<W> Again an opportunity to play K16; it is now another temporarilly hot move (Since if you capture K15, H13 wasn't a threatening move after all)]

(;W[hf];B[ig];W[jg];B[ik];W[kj];B[hi]
(;W[jh]C[<W> This move seems wasted to me; you should be able to connect or live here easilly. Try playing into the enemy's semi-moyo instead, something like L8]
;B[gg];W[ne];B[fm]
(;W[mn]C[<W> This is too deep, you don't really have a chance of connecting.]

(;W[eo]C[<W> This is needless, if you want to play close, do F4, so you also become stronger on the botton edge. Or just play H3 at once.]

;B[gr];W[gq];B[hq];W[hs];B[lr]C[<W> You play a better endgame here, and with E9 here, you have a victory in hand.]

(;W[eq]C[<W> F4 is a much better way to secure this position; this is gote.]

(;W[jk]C[<W> You have to fill K10 anyway, so might as well play it at once. Or just capture M8 for the missing liberty.]

(;B[lm];W[qq]C[<W> Absolutely urgent to cover K11.];B[pq];W[pn]
;B[qn];W[po];B[rm];W[qo];B[ro];W[rp];B[pp]C[<W> Leave this position for ko threats at this point.]
;W[so];B[oo];W[rr];B[qr];W[tt]C[<W> O16 is uncovered; try to always see the consequences of filling all dame with your, or your opponents, stones.]
;B[bg];W[dg];B[bj];W[bk];B[be];W[bd];B[ai]C[<W> B12 and A14 kills without a chance here. Especially a move like B12 should never go unplayed. Free chance at reducing three-space into one eye.]

(;W[ae];B[af];W[bf];B[ji];W[lh];B[be];W[pr];B[ah]C[<W> R1 is much bigger than blacks meagre life on the edge. Well, 4-5 points, anyway.]

(;W[bf];B[rq]C[<W> This gives you an extra chance at playing K10 to win.]
