AB[dp][pd];W[cd];B[pq];W[qo];B[op];W[pm];B[jq];W[qf]C[RS: I think white should have extended here but not this far.  Not sure how to counter it.



--> This move is ok.  For a handicap game, this kind of reach is the right idea -- white has to try for more than he deserves and bank on being able to handle complexity better.  If b tries to punish by splitting (and thereby playing near white's strength), white can try to take advantage of it.]

(;B[nd]C[A steady move, but a touch easy on white.  See variation for one alternative.  If you prefer to play on top, I  would try 017 instead to have a secure position without need of another move, leaving w to defend his too-thin stones in gote and without a rock solid way to actually seal the whole side.]
;W[lc]C[--> W is playing handicap style -- keep b from anything big and count on being able to live everywhere,   This, too, works ok here since he can treat the r14 stone lightly -- if b tries to pincer, white can pincer the pincer with a good extension from the q7 stone and still have the corner open as well.]
;B[ic];W[le];B[ed]C[RS: I thought high would complement the low stone at J17.


--->low-high works better, of course, if you are low on the borders and high in the middle, rather than vice versa.  Here e17 works better, since if white kicks at d17, he gives you perfect shape, and if he tries to split you at g17, he's got more weak groups to tend than you do, plus you can attach to the splitting stone and make profit by attacking the weak group he has left.]
;W[ec]C[--> w makes the right play.];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd]C[RS: Are my stones too compact?  Did I play the wrong joseki?


-->yes, you are a bit overconcentrated here.  You could actually tenuki and just play g17 if w plays f16; your group is stable enough to run or set down roots without f16.]
;W[nf];B[ce];W[be]C[RS: I know he skipped an essential move over here and I must punish it.  Is this a good sequence?


-->it's a good sequence, but not as essential as the upper right.]
;B[cf];W[rd];B[bf];W[bd]C[-> w response is small. B would have a hard time killing the corner, and now another move, probably around c6/c7, seems urgent.  It's true that b would become outrageously strong after attacking the upper left, but his stones there are already very powerful.]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[me];W[mf];B[ld];W[kd]C[-->good breakout sequence for b.]
;B[md];W[kc];B[ke];W[lf];B[je];W[nb];B[ob];W[mb];B[pb];W[ib]
;B[rb];W[sb];B[qa];W[cn]C[--> b should h18 here.  He will get some more territory on top and even more power in the center in absolute sente.  B is solid everywhere else, so c6 is not threatening anything.  B's only potentially weak spot is the top middle.]

(;B[cl]C[RS: To use the thickness on c14 played here.  Do you agree?

-->absolutely -- this is the best pincer.];W[en];B[fp];W[dk]
C[RS: Can you show me the best way to handle this kosumi?  Not sure if my play was good.]

(;B[ck]C[-->This is a standard joseki.   However, with your thickness on the top left, you might try d8 -- especially since your k15 stones break the ladder....

Playing this joseki makes w's move a success -- keeping you low where you have a lot of potential.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[di];B[dm];W[em]C[--> w needs to connect at d6.  The three stones have room to run, as the real game later shows.]
;B[dn];W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq]

;W[go]
(;B[el];W[fm];B[dl]C[RS: Do you like my isolation of his 3 stones here.  In order to do it I gave him a solid eye at F6.]
;W[gm];B[fj];W[fi];B[gi]C[RS: I think this hane is okay.  What do you think?  Am I attacking from the right direction?

--> it's the right direction.  f10 might have been a little too close to the w stones -- gives him wiggle room.]
;W[gj];B[fk];W[gh];B[hi];W[hh];B[ii];W[de]
(;B[dd]C[Though you shouldn't have to lose them, you should be prepared to sacrifice the f17 stones in order to capture w's center.]

(;B[ch]C[RS: I thought this move would be closer to the stones I am attacking, but was B12 better?

;B[bi];W[dh]
(;B[df];W[ee];B[eg];W[ge];B[gf]C[-->good to see this kind of move.]
;W[fe];B[he];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[id];W[hf]

;W[fg];B[gg]C[RS: What do you think?

(;B[fh];W[bg];B[ki];W[cg];B[kh];W[af];B[jb]C[RS:Well now the groups are somewhat settled.  I killed a group but not the one I was attacking.


-->yes, but w got much more than he deserved -- the uper left has become big, your left has become small, and he has inroutes into your center.  All this just because you didn't defend solidly after d12.]

not exacty, but it didn't help.  I won't go into too many of the other ways you could still save it.  A few moves later I'll show one variation, and that's it for comments except on the other branches here.]
