;B[dq]C[This game is quite interesting
as there are many possibilities for each player to recover from a bad
situation or to take the lead over the opponent.
By the way, the record of the end of the game is unclear as the sgf seems corrupted.]
;W[pd];B[qp];W[dd]C[Classical];B[qf];W[pi];B[of];W[nd];B[rd]
;W[qc];B[qh]LB[ri:a]C[Till now, nothing wrong for both sides. Black 12 is usually played at "a".
This black move exhanged for white next move is not good for black as
it strengthen white more than black.];W[qi];B[ql]C[It looks a good
point];W[do]LB[ni:a]C[I would prefer to defend at "a" as being capped
by a black on that very place looks painfull for white];B[eo]
;W[en];B[ep];W[co]LB[fn:a][dm:b]C[This
move is a bit strange. It let's Black play hane at "a" with good
prospects. The usual move would be at "b"];B[cp]LB[fn:a][dm:b]
C[I think outside is bigger than corner. Now white can play "a" or "b" and his shape is efficient]
;W[fn];B[oq]LB[gp:a]C[I'm not sure about this one.
JH : Not bad. Also possible to defend at "a".];W[ni]C[Good]
;B[cf]LB[mf:a]C[Looks natural to play "a" to go out and keep White weak.]
;W[ch];B[ef];W[fd];B[dh];W[di]LB[ci:a]C[In this case, it may be better for white to draw back simply at "a".]
;B[eh];W[ei];B[cc]LB[ci:a]C[I was trying to take the corner, without letting my 23 and 25 die.
This seems too much. Why not try the cut at "a" to get stabilized]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[bf]C[It looks like black is in a hard time with 2 groups.]
;B[eb];W[ce]LB[cg:a]C[I think "a" lets less aji (possibility for the future]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[ge]LB[gf:a]C[You play keima to attack, tobi to flee. Here Black must go away and play simply "a"]
;W[ff];B[ee]LB[fe:a]TR[cf][cg]C[As
the shicho is good, Black can play simply at "a" and take one stone
even if he has to sacrifice his 2 delta stones.];W[fe];B[ed]
;W[df]LB[ec:a]C[No. White should play "a" and fight against the whole group.]
;B[dg]LB[ec:a]C[This is bad as it let White play "a". Play it yourself.]
;W[fh]C[Good. Black is is trouble.];B[de];W[ec];B[ci]C[This is worthless. Better to play elsewhere.]
;W[bh];B[fg];W[gg];B[dc]C[it turned out that they got trapped... so I just try to recover by making my corner stay alive.

What do you think of those moves?

There isn't a lot of trades to do a Ko at F17 and G14

JH : Black is right to play this move and the next one to prevent White from doing so in sente.]
;W[fc];B[fb];W[gf];B[rc]LB[mf:a][hc:b]C[May be jumping at "a" then play "b" is natural]
;W[rb];B[lc];W[sb]LB[me:a][ic:b]C[This move is out of scope : too small. Play "a" or "b"]
;B[oc];W[od];B[nc];W[md];B[pb];W[qb];B[mf]LB[mc:a]C[It looks the right time to play the variation with "a".]

(;W[ld];B[kc];W[kd];B[ic];W[gi]C[Why to play here? It is too cautoious.]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[jp]LB[pg:a][pf:b][rg:c]C[Black group is may be in danger with "a", "b", "c"]
;W[jq]LB[oo:a][rg:b][ng:c]C[Classical
points of reduction is at "a" but white should first attack Black and
stabilize himself beginning with "b" or "c" first.];B[kq];W[kp]
;B[lq];W[ip];B[jo];W[hq]C[White invasion was not so good. It is better to connect simply anyway.]
;B[jr];W[iq]C[Too bad shape for white];B[lo];W[io];B[jn];W[cr]
C[I'm not too sure what to do here...
so just follow along a bit...
JH : White is doing too much.];B[cq];W[er]LB[dr:a]C[Black is good. Just play "a"]
;B[fq];W[fr];B[dr]C[I thought his next move will be D1, but it turn out to be B2..]
;W[br];B[es];W[gr];B[bo];W[bq];B[bp];W[bn];B[as]LB[ao:a]C[This black move is bad even if funny. Black should play at "a"]
;W[go]LB[ao:a]C[No, play at "a" to kill];B[an];W[ao]LB[bm:a]
C[Big mistake for White. Simply play at "a"];B[cn];W[am];B[dn]
;W[ap]C[Looks overplay but playable.];B[bm];W[an]LB[cm:a]C[White is crazy. He should play a kô at "a"]
;B[al];W[aq];B[cl];W[bl]LB[bk:a]C[Not good. White has some aji at "a"]
;B[bk]C[so anyways... this part is over...

what
do you think I should've done?];W[on]C[This is may be dangerous. White
should first take care of the 4 stones on the right.];B[nl]
LB[ol:a]C[I did poorly in the next couple of trap moves.
so..
what do you think?

;W[mm];B[ml];W[ln];B[km];W[kn];B[jl];W[ko];B[no]LB[ol:a]C[This move is not so good. May be playing "a" is good enough]
;W[ol];B[ok];W[om];B[pk];W[qn];B[ro];W[lp];B[mo]LB[mq:a]C[This move is not so good. "a" seems better]
;W[mp];B[nq];W[np];B[oo]LB[op:a]C[Wrong. just play "a" and leave black capture three stone which make only one eye]
;W[op];B[po];W[pp]LB[pq:a]C[Now Black is bad.
At this stage play "a" is better.];B[qo]C[Now it is too late to kill White.]

;W[sm];B[so];W[rm];B[rr];W[rs];B[ps];W[qs]LB[sp:a]C[Black should play "a" as in variation.]

(;B[nr];W[sp];B[sq];W[ss];B[sl];W[pn];B[pl];W[nn]C[any suggestions?]
;B[li]LB[jd:a]C[How do you think I should approach the 4 whites?

I did it this way... and it didn't work
JH : Black is a littke weak so may be begin with "a" to threat the other group.]
;W[lh];B[mh];W[mi];B[lj];W[pg]C[Good move.];B[pf];W[mg]LB[lf:a]
C[Next move for Black is "a"];B[lg];W[nh];B[kh]LB[ng:a]C[Better to play atari at "a" first. Black can capture White by kô]
;W[nf]C[White is playing well here.];B[mh];W[ng]C[anyways.. I failed to trap him, and I also failed to survive...

what do you think I should've done?];B[qg]LB[ri:a]C[This move is not good. Play "a" to live]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[re];B[qe];W[rf];B[se];W[sf]LB[sc:a]C[No need to play here. Just White can kill with "a".]

(;B[sg]LB[qd:a]C[Good !! But whet about "a" --> see variation. You get more kô threats.]
;W[sc];B[si];W[sj];B[rj]C[Nice
kô for Black.];W[sh];B[rg]C[I tried to use this KO to make a comeback,
because as of this point, I'm behind by a lot...];W[rf];B[si]
