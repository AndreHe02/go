C[Hello, I am the black player in this game. I wanted to submit a game to get some feedback. This game is similar to many of the games I have played recently. Although I didn't lose by an enormous amount, and the loss was unnecessary, I would appreciate any suggestions.]
;B[pd]C[Hi!
My name is Peter and I think this game is very useful to show you some points for improvement.]
;W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[qn]LB[ec:B][ed:C][id:A][dj:D]C[After the first two stones I expected moves like A,B or C.
A is the chinese opening, which gives you great influence on the upper side and down the left  and right. There are several books written about this opening and it's quite famous, so I don't want to talk much about it.
B and C are moves to build a shimari in the UL. That form is very desirable and W has to play around D to not let you get this very big point. With that shimari in your back it's much nicer to attack at R6.
Your move now invites a W pincer attack on the right as a preparation to a kakari at C.]
;W[qk];B[on];W[nq];B[qp];W[po];B[pn];W[qo];B[ro];W[qq]C[Black gets off easy!]
;B[rp]LB[qg:A][ok:B][mn:C][rp:D]TR[qk]C[But what's the price?
The B stones were already out to the open middle. Instead of saving one stone better put pressure on W by using the B wall for a pincer attack at the marked stone with A, thus extending the UR and forcing W to run into the middle with B. Then you have the choice of keeping the pressure with C (which also threats an invasion on the lower side) or creating a base for yourself by connecting at D.
As before, good move, but too early. Try prepare those moves as long as you are in sente.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[ed];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[cg]LB[jc:B][jd:A]
[cg:D][eg:C]C[wrong side.
If you extend at A or B, it's bigger, more pressure to the three W stones and if W jumps out at C, you still get D.]
;W[jd];B[kc]LB[qd:A]C[too small.
W already got a base and this is a Thank-you-move for W fortify it.
If you want to do something for your UR corner, play A. That moves secures the corner and threats a fatal invasion at between the two W stones on the right side, surely capturing one of them. W has to look after them in his move and that leaves you in sente to attack the LL corner.]
;W[jc];B[kd];W[dk];B[iq]C[Late, but necessary, I fear.];W[gq]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[mp];W[mq];B[kp];W[lo];B[lr];W[no];B[io];W[rd]
C[;-)];B[qc];W[pi];B[rq]C[good.
now you need your base. (although, as you know now, it wasn't necessary to let it come to this point.)]
;W[qr];B[rl];W[rk];B[ql];W[ci];B[eg];W[gn]C[The LL corner is huge! To remain in the game I had to reduce it. I thought about doing the standard 3-3 invasion, but I didn't think this would reduce the region sufficiently. Also, I have been trying to improve my close-up fighting so...

At the moment, you are behind by about 30 points. A 3-3 invasion reduces the opponents territory +- 20 points. Also W would get so much outside influence to consolidate the loss in the middle. So your judgement was right.]
;B[dn];W[co];B[fn];W[fo];B[fm];W[gm];B[gp]LB[go:A]C[Maybe better cut at A.]
;W[fp];B[hq];W[go];B[fk];W[ei];B[gk]C[This move doesn't protect the cut at F8 like I had intended...]

C[good...];W[oh];B[oo]LB[lg:A][oo:B][rr:C]C[... but you have to jump out to A.
B is a terrible thank-you-move, giving no advantage to the B group, but saving W's position.
If to play in the corner, play C.];W[op];B[nn];W[mn];B[ml];W[gh]

What, if W now plays at B?];W[df];B[fi];W[fj];B[gj]LB[ej:A]
C[Better at A. Think about it.];W[ej];B[hh];W[dg]
(;B[eh]C[Instead of connecting here, placing a stone at C14 would have been better. However, at this point I believe my invasion was a success and I have the upper hand.

The invasion was successful, mostly because of the destruction of W's middle influence, but it's still a close game.]

Why? The ladder works for B and getting these W stones really gives you the upper hand. See variation.]

You're right about the score. But W was in the lead for about the last 40 moves. Why did you wait until all possible connections to the outside are blocked and nearly no ko-threats are left?
So before playing endgame moves and solving small ko's, calculate the scoring carefully and seek your chances early instead of hoping for miracles. ;-)]

C[I should have been more careful about my cutting points!

I believe there is a way of dealing with this invasion so that it isn't a problem (see variation), but it's not what I did in the game.

You're absolutely right. With that LL corner miracle you've won the already lost game (which you could've won) only to loose it by this wrong answer. Your variation is correct.]

Both had several chances to win. I hope I could give you some ideas to see the important moves.
I think, the best way to improve is for you to learn putting pressure onto the opponent. Your fighting is good, but keep the pressure up. Hunt weak groups; not for killing them, but to use their flight for building up territory, influence or strength whlie chasing them.

I really would like to see some of your next games. If there is a good one, maybe you want to show it.

Hope you enjoyed this review and keep up enjoying the game.

Bye, Peter])
