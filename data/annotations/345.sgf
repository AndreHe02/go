DT[1996-11-08]TM[600]KM[0.5]HA[2];W[qp];B[cd];W[ed];B[dg];W[he]C[allan: i was thinking about c11, too. d17 seemed to cautious, but this may be too bold...

kevin:  d17 is definitely too passive.  The standard move to settle yourself in the corner

is c17.  After c17 black can answer at b17 or d17.  If the former, things are simple: a

sequence like b b17 w d17 b b18 w h17 would be typical.  If black fights by responding

at d17 things get complicated, but white should not have any trouble settling himself

here - consult a joseki book for the variations.  If white doesn't want to settle things

in the corner, then an extension along the upper side is possible.  Keep in mind that

black has the sequence b e17 w f17 b d17 w f16/g16, so white's extension needs to be

far enough away so as not to be averconcentrated after that, perhap k16/k17.  I don't

understand why you chose to play on the 5th line here.  In general the 3rd line is for

taking territory and the 4th for making a moyo/getting influence.  Usually the only   reason to play on the 5th line is to "get above" an opponent's position.  Here, black

has no stones nearby, so there's no real reason for it.  There is more one can say   about this position (black's large knight's move is slighty thin so there's some aji,

it's a handicap game so maybe w should tenuki to make things complicated, etc), but

I think what I've say covers the most important parts.];B[mc];W[cn]C[I wouldn't have played here.  It gives black a good dual purpose extension/pincer.  White

was, of course, losing from the beginning (black got 2 stones), but it's quickly getting hard

to find good moves.  If w makes a shimari in the lower corner, black can extend from his

shimari getting a double wing formation and thwarting the primary direction of developemnt

for w's shimari.  My incliniation would be to approach the upper corner, or the lower corner

>from the other side.  In the latter case, if b responds on the left, I'd extend from my   approach move to somewhere like l3 or l4 aiming at either getting a large scale position

by extending up the right side (and limiting black's shimari), or if b prevents that, coming

in to the left side position around c9, splitting black's postion on this edge and trying

to use the high position of h15.  All of this could be way wrong, it's hard for me to find

moves for white I'm happy with here.];B[dn];W[co]C[This is way too submissive.  Black should have been happy to play a pincer/extension.

The move at d6 just settles both black and white's groups.  Since black is strong here,

that is not at all what he should want.  Given that, white should happily follow the   normal joseki and play d7.  The typical sequence wuld then be something like b e6

w c5 b c4 w c10 b k3.  White would have established a solid position splitting black's

side in two.  Playing c5 allows black to force white into a low position and get far

more influence than he deserves.  Notice that after w c5 b d5, if w tries to play d7

black can respond far more severely now that the d6 stone has been strengthened.]
;B[do];W[cp]C[allan: maybe i should have gone in the other direction here, before b c9?

kevin: I don't think so.  Black can't really ignore this and let you play d3 as

you'd take a largish corner that used to be black's.];B[cr]C[This seems odd, b c3 would seem more natural.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[br];B[dr];W[jq]C[allan: trying to reduce the benefit of black's wall

kevin: a good idea.  There are some problems though:




 1> remember the proverb: "Don't play near thickness".  Black's wall is quite

strong, so white shouldn't extend so far from the friendly stone.  Exactly how

far white could go here is hard (for me) to say, but I'd guess somewhere around n3.



 2> remember the proverb: "Urgent points before big points".  The extension along

the bottom is really big for whomever plays it, but it's not "urgent", meaning it

doesn't really threaten anything.  If black gets to hane at c7 white will have to   respond and will end up living, but in a fairly small way, while black will get to   buid a lot of thickness along the left and center.  In particular the weakness around

c11 would disappear.  I'm not sure what the right way for white to play on the

left is" maybe c8, d7, or c7.  If black ignore's it to extend along the bottom, white

gets to extend up c11 (possibly playing c17 first to take away black's base in the

corner).  This not only takes some territory, but stifles black's developement on

this edge, and aims at attacking the b group (exploiting the fact that d13 was

somewhat thin).  I'd imagine B would answer here, and white would eventually

get sente to come back to the bottom edge.  Nonetheless the thickness B gets

>from this wall is tremendous, which stems from white's bad move at c5 letting

B squish him down like this.];B[np];W[oq]C[This is really out of the question.  As I said, your extension at k3 was too close to

black's thickness.  Now you're forcing black to cut that stone off from all it's friends.

I'm not sure what I'd have played here, but o3, n4, and n5 all look conceivible.]
;B[nq];W[mr]C[You seem to have realized that you need to help the single stone, but this is not

the way.  Look at it this way, if you'd played n2 without p3, b would have had to   respond around here to keep you from connecting.  After that you never would have   forced at p3 to help black cut you apart.]
;B[nr];W[gq]C[Reasonable, although given black's thickness here, I might have tried something tighter.

Maybe h3, or maybe something to like m4 push against black's three stones.  In any

case, look at the position around o3.  To me, it looks like white had a knight's move

here, and black got 3 moves in a row to cut across it.  That's hard to imgine unless   there was a huge ko fight or something.  All of which shows that white's play here

was inconsistent, which is one of the big things to avoid.  Whever you play a stone,

you have an obligation to see that it works to the fullest.];B[pj];W[ol]

  The outcome of this fight was horrible for w.  Black's 3 stones at o2,3,4 which   were slightly weak have become very strong (and taken some territory), while   white's weak group along the bottom has gotten no stronger, and is now going

to be a serious burden.  Along the right side, white has taken a little territory, but

black has more than enough compensation in the large framework that's been created

above it.  There were several options along the way, and I'm not sure which was

right.  Maybe o5 at r6 would have been good enough - I'm not sure.];W[qi]
;B[qj];W[ri]C[

  The peep at r11 was perhaps ok (although there's probably no good reason to

play it yet, it's not going away).  The move at s11 is heavy.  After black responds   the 2 white stones are just as weak as before, and the white stones below have   been weakened.  Don't get into the habit of playing moves just because your   opponent must respond, make sure they do something useful.  After the r11/r10

exchange, maybe you could have played r16 with the idea of taking a large corner

away from black, or, if he defended the corner, building up some strength by   leaning on the corner to attack the group o10 etc.]
;B[si];W[rg]C[allan: s13 felt awkward, maybe I should have just sacrificed the s11 group and tried to use them to build something on the outside?

kevin:  Things are tough here, but the problem is earlier, in that you let these stones

become heavy (i.e. hard to sacrifice effectively).];B[pi];W[sh]C[Again, there's no reason to play this yet.  In this position you could play o13 or o12

trying to get a somewhat higher position.  Your aim here should be to either get to

go into the corner or to attack the black stones below.];B[sj];W[qh]C[     You're alive (almost), but you haven't accomplished much.]
;B[qe];W[qc]C[This is impossible.  Your group on the outside is not alive, and is far too large to

sacrifice at this point.  Here you needed to live or run.  S16 is probably sufficient

for life, but a move like p13 which runs out while attacking is better.]
;B[pc]C[This is a mistake, black should just play s16 and cleanly kill your group on the

outside.];W[re];B[rd];W[rf];B[qg];W[qd];B[rc];W[qf];B[pg];W[pe]C[This is bad, you need to play r18.  If black connects at 016 you capture the 2

stones by s18, and if black plays around s18 then you can take at o16 and still kill

the three stones in the corner.  Now, you have big problems.];B[qb];W[ph]

 RolfP 18k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[rh];W[ld];B[me];W[md];B[nd];W[nc];B
[od];W[lc];B[mf];W[oe]C[There better choices for both sides since my last comment, but this result is about

what one could expect.  White is in big trouble.  Let's estimate the score:



  For black:



  Bottom right: about 10

  Upper left: say 5

  Upper right: about 45

  total: 60



  For white:



   Bottom left: about 8

   Top edge: about 20      Right side: about 5

   total: 33



 Add to that the fact that white's group on the bottom is very weak, so black can

expect profit from attacking it,  the fact that it's black's move and the severe move

at c7 or c8 still exists to swell black's position in the UL far beyond 5 while white

has no real possibilities for expansion, and I'd say black's probably ahead by 40

or more here.



  For the rest of the game you clearly outplay your opponent.  The sequence to come

at the top is horrid for black - it improves white's position and gives up sente.    Likewise, at the bottom, black takes the stone at n2 and in return gives white a

solid group here, with more territory than black gains from his capture.  I've addressed

your specific questions in the rest of the game, but otherwise I'm stopping here.]

;B[sl];W[sn];B[ck];W[dl]C[allan: this was also a shot in the dark - i thought i had to get out there to prevent b getting so large area

kevin: where is the large area you're afraid of?  This stone can easily be cut off.  The   only hope is that black will have to answer from his d6 group (to stop you from attacking

it), and that then you'll be able to connect this to c6.   It seems likely that black can

just cut this off with c8 and easily win the fight in the center,  but black is enough ahead

that he can afford to not let things get complicated.];B[fm];W[hn]C[allan:...so I guess h6 was a little inconsistent. maybe i should have d7 instead?

kevin:h6 is rather passive - your group is in no danger anymore.  d7 is a possibility,

as are c7, c8 and d9.  Since black has been kind enough to let you connect, you really   have no choice.]
