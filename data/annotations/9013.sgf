AB[dd][pd][pp]PL[W];W[dp]C[The main theme of this game is: play the big moves. 
To understand fuseki and handicap Go better you can read:

In the beginning - by Ikuro Ishige
Kage's secrect chronicles of Handicap Go - by Toshiro Kageyama (a really good book!)]

(;W[er]C[This looks unnecessary, there are so many bigger moves on the board... (look at the variations). White is down 3 corners to 1! White must play bold and tactic moves to regain equality while Black attacks her thanks to his advantage.]
;B[qn]C[and again... there's bigger moves around! One must play the big moves, especially during fuseki and yose this makes the difference between life and death.]
;W[gp]C[Perhaps White thinks she's reducing black, but black has 3 corners and one side. She really needs to focus more on developing potential areas where she would like to make territory in the future.]

[ss]C[White is making a moyo? well, ok, but look at how many points you're gaining compared to how many you could get playing one the big moves I showed before.

bottom left: 39 points at most. That's all white has now.
bottom right: 34 points. And it's just one of black's 3 corners!]
;B[cf];W[dj]C[Too loose and too close to your influence area.

Go proverb: play far from your own influence.

Study Haeng-Ma :) (the book I recommended before - "In the beginning" - could offer you some great insights on the topic).]
