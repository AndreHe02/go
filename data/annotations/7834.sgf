C[Hi
   I'm Anand and I played white in this game. It was a well fought game and I won by only slightly more than komi.

All suggestions are welcome: about joseki, fighting, tactical or strategic mistakes, endgame.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[cj];W[nc];B[oc]C[I don't think this is good for black?

I think this is OK. certainly not an error. this is a common joseki.]
;W[nd];B[cn];W[fq]
(;B[hq]TR[qn]C[Black didn't finish out joseki on top right side I think? Q14 or R14 is normal?

Also H3 seems to be wrong direction I think? The lower side is not interesting?

In the top right, it is normal to play q14, r14 a bit wimpy. H3 is... not usual, though difficult to punish. it would be better for him if you had played at f4.]
(;W[jq]LB[qn:B][nq:A]C[I just pincered on instinct. Was it right?

On reflection, right side or top side seem more interesting? How should I have approached them?

See variations];B[kq]C[Black gives up on other stone and I become overconcentrated I think?]
;W[jp];B[jr];W[ir];B[js];W[is];B[lr];W[iq];B[pj]
(;W[od]C[This was to seal black in and build thickness so I can invade black's framework.

This seems wrong to me. Black followed up badly though.]
(;B[ob];W[pe];B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[se]
(;W[sf];B[rc];W[qg];B[qh]C[Terrible by black! Don't do this!]
;W[nb]C[Here I thought whether to play K16/17. But sealing black in seemed more appealing.

I would prefer the extension, or playing a move to do something about black's lower right.]
;B[hc]C[He takes the spot :(]
(;W[jc]C[I know not the play close to your own thickness, but I didn't see any profit on the other side to pincer at E17/F17 because black has extension to L17. So I thought I'll build up a small moyo.

Do you know the rule of thunb for extensions? On the third line, you extend n+1 spaces from a wall of n stones. you have 3/4 stones in your wall on the right, and a 3 space extension, so are over concentrated. Thickness of for attacking, not profit! f17 was the move.]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[ic];W[eb];B[fc];W[ph]C[This acts only to strengthen black. This the definition of a thank you move.]
;B[qi];W[jd];B[jb];W[kb];B[ja]
(;W[ka]C[aji keshi again. Stop keshint that aji!];B[hb];W[ga]
C[This overplay leads to black having two eyes and my corner is threatened.

Yes, this move wasn't good. You need to ask yourself what the move achieves. Here, it only serves to solidify black's position.]
;B[ha]
(;W[fb]C[mistake.];B[gb];W[fa]TR[eb][fb]C[D18 was much better

Indeed. The empty triangle is rarely the best move, try and avoid them under all circumstances!]
;B[db];W[cb];B[ea];W[ji]LB[jf:C][lh:B][oh:A]TR[jc]C[At least I have a small framework.

A small, weak, highly reducible framework which black can attack for profit! this shows why you shouldn't have played the triangled stone. So many stones played to surround so little territory. A, B and C seem like devastating moves for your territory.]
;B[cf]LB[ed:A]
(;W[be];B[dd];W[cc];B[ce];W[de]C[Looking back I think it was useless to cut here, both black groups are alive

Yes. Best to leave it as a Ko threat later.];B[ed];W[ef];B[df]
;W[ee];B[bf];W[ad]
(;B[bp];W[cq];B[bq];W[br];B[cp];W[dq];B[do];W[qq]C[I had my eye on this for a while, since black can't use his thickness now. I was debating whether to invade here or right hand side?

I think it's a tough one. Probably, seeing as black has a good extension from the wall he is about to build on the right hand, it is probably best to reduce there first. If you hadn't played the move q12, then invasion on the right would be much better.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[nq]C[I give up the corner to capture lower side stones]
;B[op];W[mr];B[pr];W[ns];B[qr];W[lp];B[lq];W[mq];B[mp];W[kp]
;B[np];W[ls];B[rq]C[very poor from black.];W[ni]C[I did a rough estimate here and thought that I was ahead. Am I right?

I just thought that at top for me, cancels out right side for black. Corners are roughly equal, but I have more potential in center.

score estimater says you have it by 11.5, but black has such secure territory, and strong bases from which to reduce aggressively, so I think I would prefer black's position.]
;B[nj];W[mj];B[mk];W[nk]C[I become greedy here...I thought I will do mutual damage, but he takes out more out of my framework than I from his.

yes, this is a little ambitious.];B[oj];W[ml];B[lk];W[lm]C[I was worried about my cutting stones]

The bottom left is pretty big (A2) though G15 is also large. Black should have tenukied a few times here, especially for this one.]
