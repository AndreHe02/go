;B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[cc];B[fq]C[this move is odd.  if you want to make a shimari here, c4 should be  played instead of d4.  Here, the corner is still open to a 3-3 invasion.  approaching one of w  corners is probably  better here.]
;W[cf];B[gd]C[this move feels a little too close to w for my taste.  it is hard
for  w to make a big  moyo from the 3-3 stone, so I don't think this approach is urgent right now.
  maybe R6  is better.];W[ck];B[dd]C[this move only helps white.  R6 looks better here.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[df];B[nc]C[this seems very odd to me.  w made a far extention to C9.  the
D15-D14  exchange  you made helped W a lot and did not really help you much.  your stones have
no  more of a  base than before, but W's extension is stronger now.]
;W[ic];B[kc];W[ie];B[gf];W[gb];B[qn]C[you cannot tenuki here.  your G16 stones are outnumbered 7-4 in that  area.  W will get  alot of profit by attacking them now.]
;W[nq];B[pj]
(;W[qf]C[W let you off the hook here.  he should play H13 and chase your weak  group.  see previous variation.  W played G18, which means he can connect his
running  group anytime  with E18, so it is hard for you to counterattack his running group.  That  makes his group  much stronger than yours.]

(;W[ql]C[again W lets you off the hook.  he should ignore this area and
attack  your  weak group.  see previous variation.  your reply locally is not good.  see  var. 1]

(;B[ol]C[this move just asks W to capture your R6.  maybe instead just Q8  attach here.  W R8  is hard to play here.  W should play Q8 here if he wants to play in this
area];W[pm];B[om];W[pn];B[on];W[oo]C[Q5 is stronger for W here.  R6 still has aji.]
;B[qq]C[R3 is not the best way to use the aji of R6 here.  the forcing move  you have is R5,  so playing R3 now asks W to fix his weakness in sente]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[rp];W[ro];B[sq];W[rr];B[no]C[O5 has very little effect on W.  better to play elsewhere.]
;W[rq]C[This W move not necessary as B is already dead, but since B's last  move was  wasted, W can afford to remove the ko threats and bad aji here now.]
;B[mo];W[oe]C[this w move is bad.  just Q12 attach to settle is better.]

;W[pg];B[mh];W[qj]C[w S10 is better here.];B[pk];W[ng]C[W saves 2 unimportant  stones.  very small.  he should just R9  connect,  it is much  bigger.]
;B[qk];W[rj];B[hc]C[save this as a ko threat.  w is connected already.]
;W[hb];B[jc];W[gc];B[jg];W[jb]
(;B[kd]C[this move is small and not needed.  more urgent now is to exploint  your center walls with  a move to make big territory.  maybe something like G8.  locally, L18 is  better here.]

C[to here, you have captured F 12 (maybe) and saved D15 stones  (small).  W got  to play F9 which makes your center disappear.  W looks well ahead on
territory  now.  K4 is also funny.  better to play on 3rd line here to get territory.]
;W[fj];B[lq]C[W saves his 1 stone (maybe), and lets you play a very big move.  game  is closer now.]
;W[jj];B[kf];W[id]C[This W move is too far.  J9 would be much safer.]
