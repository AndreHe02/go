C[Holo: I think you lost here, because your strategy was not consistent. I you go for influence, you should not make territory oriented moves in the beginning. Masters of go are able to get a unbelievable lot of points in the middle and endgame by using the influence and strength.
Second some moves you played were too solid. Try to evaluate the relative strength in a local position. If you are strong and your opponent is not, don't fear a fight. If your position is not significant stronger than his, it is good style to play solid.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pq];B[jd];W[po];B[pj];W[jq];B[jj]LB[dj:A]
C[Holo: I don't like this move. I would prefer a move at A. This is close to the side, trying to take territory.]
;W[cf]
(;B[fc]C[Holo: With your first 5 moves you go for influence. This move is securing territory (the corner). Your strategy  should be consistent. Consider a move as in the variation.]
;W[bd]C[Holo: Good];B[cc];W[ci];B[qc]C[Holo: Same as before. First black tries to get influence. Now black secures territory. Try to imagine what will happen, if white invades at the 3-3 point. Black will get a wall similar to that in the first variation.]
;W[qf]C[Holo: Seems very dangerous to me.]
(;B[qh]C[Holo: Maybe that is the wrong direction. I would try to confine white to the side.]
;W[of];B[nd]C[Holo: Good];W[rd];B[rc];W[rg];B[qm]LB[rh:A][re:B]
C[Holo: Why not treat the white group with A? As black can play B, white has no eye yet. So white will flee and at least black will get secure territory at the top.]

;B[oi];W[ph];B[oh];W[mf]C[Holo: Risky]
(;B[mi]LB[ld:A][pg:B]C[Holo: Sorry but this move lacks the right direction. Two move are more 'normal'.
1. Securing the top territoty, not allowing white to get an eye around there with A.
2. Try to cut the group into two with B (see variation)];W[ld]
;B[lc];W[md];B[mc];W[ne];B[od];W[kc]C[Holo: Overplay];B[kd]
C[Holo: Good];W[jc];B[ic]LB[id:A]C[Holo Easier at A. White cannot escape nor live.]
;W[id];B[jb];W[dl];B[hp]LB[fq:A][lq:B]C[Holo: What is your purpose? You will get no territorry if white blocks (as he did). If you just press white down to the second line, did you count? You can invade at A or B. White cannot kill you. At last the 3-3 point is open to invasion.]
;W[hq]

(;B[in]LB[fq:A][hm:B]C[Holo: Why not exploit the cutting points in white's shape? Try A. There is a proverb: 'Play at the head of two stones'. At last if you are extending from a 3 stone wall take a two space extension. It cannot be cut normally. Play at B.]
;W[jn];B[jm];W[kn]C[Holo: Black just helps white to enlargen his bottom territory.]

;W[qp];B[ro];W[fp];B[fo]C[Holo: Before following white here, you must know, that black can invade at the 3-3 point. That is big in itsself.]

(;B[kk]LB[fk:A][ek:B][dj:C]C[Holo: That is the wrong direction. You are strong here. So white cannot make an eye here. (Or he is a Go master :-)). Try to hold the groups separated, peraaps at A or B. You can also gain strength by playing C. See variation.]
;W[fk]C[Holo: Very good. Suudenly black is under attack.];B[en]
LB[dn:A]C[Holo: Better at A. It cannot be cut.];W[dn];B[ho]
