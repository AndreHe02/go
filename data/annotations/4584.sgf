C[Dear Reviewer, thank You in advance for the review.

This game was played on KGS for the German federal go league, 2nd Season, 2nd league. Although i won the game by resignation, the game was very close until black overlooked a damezumari in the late endgame which would have lost him 6 points. We both played rather quickly, and maybe my opponent didnt take the game too seriously because his team was much stronger than ours (3d/3d/1d/1d vs. 1d/1d/3k/3k)

I would mostly appreciate tips on the middle game, because i feel that my middle game in general needs the most improvement and because the middle game is hard to study from books.

Andreas Teckentrup.
