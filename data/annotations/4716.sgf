C[xedover: Thanks for reviewing this game for us.

I think I was ahead for most of the game, but kept making small mistakes that all added up to my losing the game.

Please help me see where I can keep a won game won.

At least two problems I have, maybe three: 1) I try too hard to kill my opponents groups, 2) I keep giving away sente, 3) I either forget to protect my cuts, or protect when I don't need to.

Don't pay too much attention to our dragon ratings, my opponent and I are close to the same skill level.

Babibo : hello xedover !
It is a hard task to review someone else's game. 
One, unless you are a pro, you also make mistakes. You have your own ideas, and moves that work well with your abilities and style of play, but you can't be sure that an idea that you have is good or not.  
Two : you can't know what the players have in mind. 

So while I made this commentary, I kept this in mind, and tried to rely on the fundamental principles.  If you apply them, you can certainly become 1st dan in no time !

You played a better go than your opponent, I think. Better in the sense that the kind of go you play should make you improve faster. You apply the principles, but you don't seem to be aware that you were dominating the board since the beginning (but for the first joseki). Try to understand the principles, and be confident. 

Babibo. (remi.vannier@tiscali.fr)];B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[cd];B[ed]
;W[dg]LB[cc:B][oq:A]C[I'm not familiar with white D13, but I don't like your answer. Actually, I can't really say why. I'll try to give you hints.

Here are basic concepts of joseki, that could help you to understand how to create your own without knowing lots and lots of josekis. (learning josekis is boring, and you won't improve much if you know them by heart. By the way, learning josekis is bad for your creativity, and can reduce greatly the fun in the game)
first, the corner is very important : it contains 
- a lot of points (in the sense that it is easy to make territory there)
- eyes

In a joseki, you'll play elsewhere as soon as you feel like both white and black groups are settled. (see variation A-P3 to understand why you have to continue playing in the corner)

So here, you want to settle as quickly as possible, while denying white his eye shape.

Now look at variation B]
(;B[ff]C[Wow ! A stone on the 6th line ! Usually, it's not very efficient. 4th line is the maximum in the fuseki. (except for Takemyia) 
I can' tell you not to play like that, because I don't really know myself why it is bad. But you should know that it is unorthodox.]
;W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[gd]C[Now white has the territory, the side , a life base, and sente. Mmmmh. This can't be joseki ! ! !]
;W[nd];B[kd]C[Good. This move is both a pincer and an extension.]
;W[jd]C[Strange move. In that case, believe the principles : 
1. you have to defend your L16 stone
2. it's important that white's stones remain cut apart
3. nobi when you're stronger in the area, hane when you want to create complications
Here, nobi (what you did) is correct]
(;B[ke];W[ie];B[pf]C[OK. Now white has 2 groups to defend.]
;W[nf];B[kg];W[hf];B[fh];W[hh];B[di]C[Very good.]
(;W[eh]C[I don't think white is in position of creating complications.]

(;B[gi];W[fj];B[gh];W[gg];B[fg];W[df];B[hj];W[fl];B[dl];W[ek]
;B[dk];W[co];B[dn]C[Good idea. 
Your last 10 moves were very good, I think :
- you took care of the weakest group
- attacked the opponent's weak group when possible

so as to take control of the center];W[gp];B[gn]C[xedover: I think one of my problems is that I try too hard to kill my opponent's groups. But so far, I feel like I've got a good shot at killing either white's f8 group or white's j15 groups (or both).  Am I being too greedy?

The way our game has been developing, its either surround or be surrounded.  So far, I feel like white has just as good a chance to kill my groups as I have of killing his.

Babibo : It's not a matter of killing. It 's a matter of attacking. By attacking, you'll gain power/territory. And you should try not to be surrounded too. Your plan is OK.]
;W[hl];B[jj]TR[jd][ie][hf][gg][hh]C[Wow. White is in big trouble.]
;W[gj];B[hi];W[ej];B[ch]C[xedover: I get nervious and think I need eyespace.

You do !];W[dj]C[White is being vulgar];B[cj];W[dh];B[ci];W[bm]
;B[bk]C[xedover:  maybe I could have played b8 instead of b9?]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[cn];B[dm];W[bl];B[ck]C[xedover:  now I'm really feeling nervious -- not sure I have two eyes yet, and not sure if I can keep white's f8 group contained at the same time.

You die if you don't add a move. (white B13). Black B14 is sente, and makes you live. Since you can't escape anymore, just live. 
You don't have to feel nervous. White has 3 weak groups, and you have only one, since you played K10. The f8 group is solid, now. It alreay has an eye, and can escape easily. 
Now you should be able to attack the 2 other groups (and there are big chances that one of them die)]
;W[gm]
(;B[go]C[xedover:  not sure what the best play here should have been.  If b-f6, then white escapes with h6. If b-h6, I think white also escapes with f6.

(;B[eo];W[do];B[fm]C[xedover:  whew! black lives. but...?];W[em]

(;B[el]C[xedover: did I miss a chance to kill white? maybe g9 instead of e8?

I don't think so]
(;W[gk];B[fm];W[hn]LB[oc:A];B[ho]LB[kc:B][pc:C][ph:A]C[Here you should either play A, B or C.
H5 is very big, but since F10 is now alive, it is hard to attack

B might not be necessary. White may already be dead. I don't know.]
;W[hk]LB[jh:A]C[quite a bad move indeed by white : it does nothing except trying to malke 2 eyes.]
;B[kp]C[Big move indeed. But Q12 is bigger because it is VERY sente.]
;W[op]C[I can't believe that. White spreads his stones everywhere. One more weak group !]
;B[pn]C[Very good. You attack and you build.];W[pr];B[hq]LB[kc:C]
[ph:A][qr:B]TR[gp]C[xedover:  I see now that perhaps something like r10 would have been better.

Yeah. There are lots of big moves. Here you only threaten to take a stone]
;W[qk]C[Another weak group];B[pi]TR[qi]C[Now, I prefer the third line. Try to deprive white of his base.]
;W[qc]C[White keeps spreading stones. Now which do you want to kill ? :)))]
;B[pc]C[Good drection];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[rc];B[rr]C[The move is a bit soft, but the idea is good. I prefer R2]
;W[lp];B[ko];W[lo];B[ln];W[ok]C[Babibo : there is a moment where you have to choose which group you want to kill. 
N6 kills for sure. And if it doesn't, it will give you enough strength to kill the other groups]

SQ[nd][nf][lo][lp][op][pr]C[xedover: I don't know what I was thinking here.  Clearly I needed to protect my cuts around m14.  Maybe I was trying to be greedy again thinking I could kill another group.

... and from a won game you had a close game. Try to know if you're winning or losing so as to decide to be aggressive or calm. Here, you clearly win the game if you play solidly and kill white's marked groups (at least 3 should die)
Here, your idea of separating P9 and M4 is not greedy. It's very good. But N4 would have been more solid, and you have a cut at M13.


The K17 group is not dead yet !]
(;W[pb];B[ob];W[qa];B[oc];W[lg]
(;B[mf]C[Bad shape (bump against a stone). M15 is better];W[kh]
;B[jg]C[xedover:  I didn't realize I couldn't escape.  So now white escapes.  Not protecting this cut at m13 was my losing move I think.  It goes downhill from here.]
;W[jh];B[mg]C[xedover: best I can do now is minimize the damage.]

(;B[pq]C[too soft];W[oq];B[qr];W[pp];B[qq];W[nr];B[kr]C[xedover:  does t3 live in the corner.  which was more important? there is still a chance later, but I miss it.

Babibo : it is better to live first, unless you are sure white will die before you (and it looks like white has more liberties]

[ii:G][in:F][no:C][lq:D][mr:E][ps:B]SQ[mh][ll]C[xedover: gote - I don't always see gote moves until its too late.  perhaps f18 better? sente?

It's not that hard to find big sente moves. Just look at the weak groups. And unless it is aji keshi (for example if it loses a ko threat and earn few points), you should play the moves that threaten life

And then there are moves that are reverse sente (gote for you but sente for the opponent) - the marked ones]
;W[db];B[fa]C[xedover: here's where I miss my last chance to live in the lower right corner.  should have tenuki'ed here and played t3]
