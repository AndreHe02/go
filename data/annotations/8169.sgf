C[Hi there.  This is a game played between myself and a member of my go club.  She is a little stronger than 4k.  When I started this game I was 16k, now I'm around 11k?

I was hoping you could help me with fighting, I managed to die in pretty much every corner I fought in.  I also had a long ass dragon that really hurt me.  I was hoping to get some pointers on how to identify problems like that before they happened.

-------------------------
Hi
I am Fabian and I am doing the review. I hope I will be able to give you some hints but in general for fighting I think you need to do Life&Death Problems.]

(;B[oe]C[I haven't yet learned how to handle approaches like this.  I'll be reading a joseki book soon, but I was hoping you could give me your insight as well.

you are right, a book helps a lot here or an online library. You can try this, it's rather good (and free):

You are stopping the attack on q9
r9 and r6 are not too strong so you should attack from them to strengthen them.
(See move 41)

with this you create a weak group that will be either dead or a huge burden... 

The most important thing for fighting is: Start fights that are favourable for you...]

Result: W+72.5




Ok so after seeing the whole game I am afraid I cannot review too many moves... it is a lot of running and fighting. But I think I have some good pointers for you.

1. I think it's not that important to learn josekis, just look up a few where you noticed you did really bad.

2. Read "In the Beginning" it is an easy book to read, most things you will already know. If you have read it, read it again. But as far as I remember it tells you which stones are important to save and which to discard. Also there is some good advice on fuseki in there.

3. Read "Attack and Defense" This is a fun book that definetly tells you how to start a fight and do well in it. To get better at fighting you need to know how to pick the fights, that are good for you.

4. There is a software called the many faces of go. It has some life and death problems that would be excellent for you to do, as there are good explainations included. The software is expensive though.


Don't hesitate to contact me on KGS  if you have further questions. My name there is GoNuts]
