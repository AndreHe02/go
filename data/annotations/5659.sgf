C[[Agi\] Hi, I'm Agilis of KGS and will be reviewing, for convenience I'll label my comments.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[jp]TR[fc][jc][cf][qk][co][po][dq]
SQ[fq][gq]C[[Agi\] K4 is likely aiming somewhere towards the marked squares. However, with D3 black can't expect to make too much profit near the squares easily. Being high here means white can easily slide under.

Various other points are worth considering.];W[hp]TR[jc][nc]
[qf][qj][qk][co][po][qo]C[[Agi\] a bit strange to clash heads with black directly like this. There are plenty of other large points available.]
;B[qo]C[[Agi\] this works nicely with K4]
(;W[mq]C[[Agi\] this invasion feels a bit hasty, and slightly misplaced. see variation.]

(;B[lo]C[[Agi\] This move is, extremely vague. it tries to block white from the center, forgetting that white can connect under]
;W[no];B[np];W[mp];B[mo];W[jq];B[kq]C[[Agi\] it is too difficult to keep white from connecting now.]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[iq];B[lr]
(;W[lq];B[kp]C[[Agi\] White gives up a golden chance to connect, AND makes an empty triangle.]
;W[mr];B[ks];W[op];B[nq];W[oq];B[oo];W[nn];B[pp];W[or];B[pr]
C[[Agi\] essentially gote at this time, at best it restricts white's eyespace, but white is able to get out into the center anyway]
;W[ir]C[[Agi\] also, essentially gote, though probably worth more in terms of points than q2]
;B[ll];W[pm]C[[Agi\] this is stretching a bit far with a weak group.]
;B[on];W[om];B[nm];W[mn];B[ln];W[mm]
(;B[lm]C[[Agi\] Black has the opportunity to squeeze white.]
;W[ml];B[dj]C[[Agi\] vague. A white play in this area is does not seem too threatening thanks to black's wall.]
;W[hm]C[[Agi\] White is overly optimistic. H7 does nothing other than try to surround a long black dragon]
;B[cf];W[hj]C[[Agi\] Again, white is better on the kill. white black can easily escape]
;B[ip];W[ho];B[hq];W[hr];B[gq];W[gr];B[fr]C[[Agi\] black should count liberties before trying this]

C[[Agi\] black is alive already, white has just built a beautiful wall, Now is the chance to  tear black apart on the left.]
;W[jh]C[[Agi\] because black is alive, this isn't sente];B[ki]
;W[kh];B[fc];W[ef]C[[Agi\] This is just asking to be cut];B[de]

[pi][nj][oj][pj]C[[Agi\] Too high, white is trying to surround  the marked area, ignoring the fact that black can easily live on the right side]

[jj][jk][kl][km][kn][ko][rq][sq][qr]C[[Agi\] The game was marked by 2 main themes. 

1) both sides tended to play far too high along the edges, just begging to be undercut.

2) both players, are letting the other side connect when they don't have to, or getting cut, when it can be easily avoided.

The early invasion by white could have been exploited if black had tried to keep the stone weak and chase it for profit.

Finally, both sides play small endgame moves when very large moves, and very large open spaces, still exist on the board.]
