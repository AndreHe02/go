C[> Hi I'm Huginmunin 4k on kgs, I'll be doing your review. I hope you find it helpfull. Feel free to contact me on kgs.
I'll precede my comments with >



Hi, I (ncast) started my comments with a #. Moves I thought about are marked with a circle.

Thank you very much for reviewing my game!];B[po];W[pc]C[astrantia [12k\]: hi
ncast [13k?\]: hi, gg];B[dp];W[cd];B[oq]LB[pe:A]C[> I think this is a bit strange, it does not secure the corner, and by playing Q5, you are already putting more importance on influence and maybe the right side, this stone feels to me like it doesn't do much.

(;B[fq]CR[gp][eq]C[#What would be better here, defend the corner or get influence on the center?

Watch out for playing bad sente, don't play too close to strength (not your own, and not that of your opponent), don't attach to weak stones too often.]
