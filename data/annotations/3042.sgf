C[NM: Game commented by "Niall"



Hi, I tend to play more for influence than territory. Often it works out but in this game, it doesn't.

Strange enough I had the feeling it all went quite well, and i didn't make any big mistakes.



I have no questions further in the game, cause i didn;'t really understand where i went wrong. I'm especially interested in the more overall strategical mistakes 



Maybe the invasion at C8 wasn't to smart? or building the f-line?



Thanks in advance for any comments..



Tomas];B[pp];W[pd];B[dq];W[ed];B[co];W[fq]C[NM: Not good. This sort of attack would work

on the other side, at O3, but here the shimari

is too strong to attack. B simply answers H3

or J3 and W has to escape, giving B a lovely

wall.];B[cd];W[ce]C[NM: I would play J3, but if you;re going to

answer in this corner this is OK.];B[dd]C[NM: Better B15.];W[de]
;B[ec];W[fd]C[NM: SHould be F17, double hane. W either

gets a big and secure corner or pushes

B down onto the 2nd line.];B[fc];W[gd];B[gc];W[hc]C[NM: Too agressive - B can cut behind it.

I would play D10.];B[hb]C[NM: W is lucky!];W[ic];B[ib];W[jc]
;B[dh]C[NM: Finally!];W[eg]C[NM: Necessary but painful.];B[dk]
;W[eh];B[di];W[cl]C[NM: Much too deep, especially with F3 still

weak. Play J3 first, then you can think of

invading. Or play something likw Q9 to build

a big framework.];B[dl];W[cm]C[NM: If B simply plays C9 now, he makes W's life very difficult. See variation.]

(;B[dm];W[cn];B[dn];W[bo];B[cp];W[bj];B[bp]C[NM: B should be in no hurry to do this, since

he may want to close off on the other side in

sente. But still it's a good result for B.];W[bn];B[bd]C[NM: Terrible!]
;W[be]C[T: maybe too small now?



NM: Tiny! Reinforces no group, attacks no group,

takes no territory, reduces B territory only

slightly.];B[hq]C[NM: Good!];W[fo]C[NM: I wouldn't try and save this stone directly.

I would either play around H9 or counter-attack

at M3.];B[ho];W[fm];B[hm];W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[hk];W[ej];B[dj]
;W[fj]C[NM: Well, OK, W has saved his stone - but look

at the price he's paid!];B[ck];W[bk];B[lp]C[NM: Big, turning the bottom right into something

like territory; but still I wouldn't play here

yet. I would play either around K12 or around

Q11.];W[hj]C[NM: At best this might make 10 points - not 

enough!];B[ij];W[qn]C[NM: Too deep. A B counter-attack at Q10 would

give him a lot of territory, and powerful

neutralising influence. I would play Q10.];B[ep]C[NM: ??? I don't understand this at all; it

merely reinforces W.];W[fp];B[qp]C[NM: Conservative, but may be enough to win.]
;W[pj];B[on];W[eo];B[do];W[jp];B[hp]C[NM: I would have answered L5.]
;W[in];B[hn];W[kn];B[mn]C[NM: K8 would be better.];W[kl];B[ml]
;W[ii];B[jk]C[NM: B should force first at G11, then H11

becomes sente. This way W can make B's life

very difficult - see variation.]
(;W[kk];B[kj];W[lk];B[lj];W[mk];B[lg]C[NM: H11 first.];W[nl]
;B[hi];W[gj];B[ji];W[ih];B[jh];W[ig];B[ld];W[mc]C[NM: I would prefer R13, which makes territory

and reinforces the weak groups.];B[lc]C[NM: Should be Q13.]
;W[md];B[me];W[ne];B[mb];W[le];B[mf];W[nb];B[ke];W[lb];B[rd]
C[NM: A tricky attack to deal with, but in this

position I would have made the simpler R14.];W[qc];B[qg]C[NM: Good!]
;W[qf];B[rf];W[qe];B[rc]C[NM: Terible!];W[re]C[NM: Of course.]
;B[se];W[rg];B[sf]
(;W[sg];B[sd];W[qh];B[pg];W[rh];B[qd]C[NM: W simply plays S18!]
;W[pe];B[qb];W[pc];B[sb];W[pb];B[qa];W[og]C[NM: Does this work? I think B can pull these

stones out if he wants. See variation.

However it gets complicated.]

C[NM: a despairing move, but surprisingly

it succeeds. I don't think it should have,

but it's difficult to see how B can kill it.];B[kq];W[mp];B[mo]

endgame, but I don't propose to comment

on those in detail unless you would like me to.];B[id];W[kc]
