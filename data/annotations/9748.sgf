C[Dear reviewer, I tried to estimate how the game stands in the moves 92, 114 and 160.  If I counted right, I was 15 points behind and then caught up. I'd be interested in hearing how I got behind, whether I caught up by solid play or white's mistakes, and of course if you see anything else I'm always grateful for any advice.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[dg];B[jd]C[Yoaav: This is a good and proper response to white's unusual decision to attach at E17. Keep in mind that white's corner is still very open to invasion (even more so given the unusually wide extension to D13--D14 or C14 are more normal). You get nice influence towards your R16 stone, and thus a lot of development potential.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nd];B[pc];W[mc];B[ld]C[Yoaav: This move is too high. White's group doesn't have a base, and your group in the top middle only kind of has a base (as white's N17 stone is undercutting you). White could play something like L17 now to take some points away from you and get some eyeshape. Better to play at L17; then white can't get an eye on the top and has to run and both your groups are strong and solid. You can then profit by attacking, or (if you want to be less agressive) just play a big move elsewhere.]
;W[lc];B[kc];W[pf];B[po]C[Yoaav: In general, this enclosure is for developing something big, whereas if you had played R5 it'd be more solid. I like the R5 better here, as white's group is definitely limiting the potential on the right.]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[ql]C[Yoaav: This exchange isn't good for you, as now white is getting a wall. Better to play in the more open areas of the board: the bottom and the left side.]
;B[pm];W[ol];B[mp]C[Yoaav: This move is too close. Yout have a lot of black stones there. How about K4 instead? (Although white's P8 group is definitely limiting the potential there, and that's a bit sad).]
;W[jp];B[kq];W[jq]C[Yoaav: Again, you're letting white become strong by playing these diagonal attachments. Unless you desperately need such a move, they're almost always bad exchanges.]
;B[jr];W[ir];B[kr];W[kp];B[lp];W[co];B[ci];W[ch];B[bi]C[Yoaav: After white attaches, go up to D11 rather than down to B11. If you go up then you get to have influence over the rest of the game. If you go down then white can play D11 and force you really low. You might die for want of eyespace, and even if you live you'll make very few points and white will have become very strong from attacking.]
;W[bh];B[cl];W[el];B[fg];W[ei];B[qf]C[Yoaav: Very dangerous tenuki (the term for playing elsewhere). I agree that your top right group isn't as strong as you might hope. But it's much easier to make eyes in the corner, so I think it'll live. But your group on the left is surrounded and has one eye at best so far. One more white move could kill it. Now's the time to think about a desperation move like B6, or perhaps trying to force your way out at C6 or D6.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[qg];B[lf];W[mg];B[kg]C[Yoaav: These moves are very small, just a few points in the middle. The group on the left's life hangs in the balance, and is thus *much* bigger. (And even without that, it'd be much bigger to invade C17 or to reduce the bottom left--although that cannot be done so long as your group on the left is weak.)]
;W[ki];B[nm];W[nl];B[mm];W[om];B[on];W[ln];B[mn]C[Yoaav: This move doesn't do anything. White can't cut at O6 because you can just atari it down and kill it.]
;W[lo];B[gi];W[gk];B[ih];W[ji];B[ii];W[ij];B[bn]C[Yoaav: This time this move is good! It's only for when you're already in a bad situation, but you were.]
;W[cn];B[bm]C[Yoaav: Charmingly enough, here you can push to B5 instead. If white tries to cut at B7 you can cut him right back at C7 and kill him. It would give you a bit more eyespace, and that'd definitely be good.]
;W[bo];B[kk]C[Here I decided to place a few stones into the centre, to use later, as threats.

Yoaav: There are two issues:

1. Your group on the left can still be killed. (See sequence below for one example.) It's definitely more important to stave off death.

2. It's almost never a good idea to place stones just to be threats. If the stone isn't actually doing anything good then it isn't much of a threat. White can just strengthen himself in response and eat your stone--making the move cost you a point and the weakness that white fixed. If you want to do something about the middle try to make some sort of incursion--just throwing stones into the middle won't accomplish anything unless white blunders.]

(;W[lm];B[jk];W[ik];B[jn];W[ml]C[Yoaav: White has now cut off the stones you put into the middle. Before there was an opening, but now there isn't. A bad result.]
;B[gn]C[Yoaav: This stone works as a ladder-breaker, but white should just respond at H3 (which makes white's bottom left solid). These stones should all be doomed.]
;W[im];B[iq];W[ip]C[Yoaav: Bad response. He should have played H2. He's giving you way too much.]
;B[hq];W[hp];B[hr];W[fq];B[gq];W[gp];B[fr];W[er];B[fs];W[es]
;B[is]C[Yoaav: Wasted move. Sure, without it he can play G1 and kill two stones. But that's gote for him. You spent a move to prevent white from having a 4 point gote move, and that's worth 2 points. But there are much bigger moves on the board! And if white made the mistake of taking the two stones then you'd get to have yet another bigger move!]
;W[mo];B[no]C[Here I sacrificed three stones on purpose to have a stronger position at the bottom, was this OK?

Yoaav: Absolutely! There are much, much bigger moves.];W[nn]
C[Here I estimated the position as follows:

BLACK
bottom 43
upper right 15
upper centre 30 (weak position)
left 6
prisoner 1
Total       95

WHITE
upper left  23
lower left 13
centre 71
prisoners 3
komi       0.5
Total    110.5

White leads by 15.5

Therefore I decided to reduce as much as possible in sente.]

(;B[rl];W[rk];B[rm];W[sk];B[rg];W[qh];B[rh];W[ri];B[eb]C[Yoaav: Bad move. After white blocks his corner becomes more solid. Much better to invade.]
;W[db];B[ed]C[Yoaav: This is also bad. Much better to let yourself have the peep at C17, then there's still aji in the corner. After that atari white's corner is just solid territory.]
;W[dc];B[fb];W[ee];B[fe];W[ef];B[fh];W[fj];B[nc];W[md];B[le]
;W[mf]C[Here I thought I had won something, but then counted a second time:

Black
bottom       43
upper right 20
upper centre  32
left  6
prisoner  1
total      102

WHITE
upper left 23
lower left 13
centre  76
prisoners    3
komi       0.5
total    113.5

White leads by 11.5

Therefore I decided to fiercely attack the centre from my now stronger position on the left.]
;B[kh];W[li];B[dm];W[en]C[Yoaav: This move is really bad. It introduces cutting points into white's position. He should have just played solidly at E7.]

;B[fl];W[gm];B[ek]C[Yoaav: Nicely done!];W[fk];B[dk];W[gl];B[el]
C[Yoaav: This move is wasted! You can still live without that eye (as a move at B9 will give you an abundance of eyes). So you just saved a stone--a 1 point move. A5 is way bigger and sente.]

;W[ma]C[Yoaav: Small gote.];B[na]C[Yoaav: Small gote.];W[lg]
;B[ah]C[Yoaav: Much better!];W[ag];B[ai];W[bg];B[ao]C[Yoaav: Also much better!]
;W[ap];B[an];W[cp];B[da]C[Yoaav: And again much better!];W[ca]
;B[ea];W[cb]C[Going into the end game, I count one last time:


Black
bottom       44
upper right 19
upper centre  29
left  10
prisoners   3
total      105

White
upper left 20
lower left 14
centre 65
prisoners   3
komi       0.5
total    102.5


And wow! I seem to lead now by 2.5 points! Very tight, though, because I am not sure how good my count is. So I try to stay in sente as long as possible.]
;B[me];W[ne];B[hj];W[hk];B[lh];W[mh];B[sh];W[si];B[rf]C[Yoaav: Gote.]
;W[qj]C[Yoaav: He responded for no reason. If you cut at R11 he could easily kill.]
;B[ff]C[Yoaav: Good block. Reverse sente.];W[eg]C[Yoaav: Dumb move from him.]
;B[jh]C[Yoaav: Another good reverse sente block.];W[np]C[And now my opponent sees that I'm leading and makes desperate attack. Could this attack have succeeded? Or did he play sub-optimum?

Yoaav: This could only succeed if you blunder. Note that even if he splits your position into two, both of those positions have two eyes. His only hope is to kill some of your stones (impossible, since all you have to do is connect to anything to stay alive) or make two eyes (impossible, since there isn't enough space and you're hugely too strong). This isn't even close to working. If it were, it should have been played long, long ago.]
;B[oo];W[nq];B[lq];W[pr];B[qr];W[or];B[rq]C[Yoaav: This is utterly, utterly hopeless for him.]
;W[oq];B[pp];W[mr];B[ns];W[ms];B[qb]CR[rk]C[Was this one necessary? I think I started to be afraid of invasions.

Yoaav: Unnecessary. If he invades you kill easily.];W[ks]C[Yoaav: No need to respond here. He's just dead.]
