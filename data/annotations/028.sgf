Comments by Jim Mattson.

My general comments are:
 1) Don't be afraid to sacrifice a few stones to your advantage.
    Trying to save them all will cost you.
 2) Don't be so cautious about ataris.  I think you're at that
    stage where you've learned not to make every atari you see,
    but now you are avoiding some ataris that are the right move.
 3) Your opening and end game are very good.  Concentrate now on      middle game tactics, tesuji, ko fights, and life-and-death      issues.]

;B[kc];W[dj];B[dl];W[dg]L[cf][df]M[dj]C[I would be tempted to play the standard kakari against the corner  stone at `a' or `b.'

This move seems like a ``halfway'' move in two respects.  It is a weak attack  against

the corner stone, and it is a weak defense for the marked stone.  Because of  the height   (fourth line rather than third line), this two space extension doesn't  bring you out of
danger.];B[fe]L[cd][cc]C[This seems like an odd reply, and probably  merits some punishment, such as `a' or `b.'
Maybe later.];W[po]C[This shimari is quite valuable, and I think the  right one to make, in keeping with
your center emphasis.];B[jp];W[pj]L[lq][lp][gp][jr]C[I think this is the wrong direction,  though.  A point like `a' is very appealing, as

an extension from your shimari.  I pick `a' over `b,' because it undercuts  black.  Even if

the invasion around `c' becomes impossible, a slide to `d' can still do some  damage.]
;B[mp]L[mq]C[Black takes the fertile ground in front of  the shimari, but I think this stone would
be better placed a line lower, at `a.'];W[cq]L[fq][fp][dq]C[When b has a double wing  formation the c3 invasion is called for, right?


This is certainly a reasonable invasion in this position, but with the long  extension

on the bottom, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of splitting black up with  a stone   at `a' or `b' instead.  (The situation is much like the corner in a high  handicap game).   
With the 3-3 invasion, you can expect black to block at `c.'  The usual  joseki ends with  
black getting a nice territorial framework in the lower left quadrant.  (See  variation.)]

(;B[cp]C[I think b blocked in the wrong direction  here

I agree.];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[bq]C[This doesn't look like joseki (at least  one that I have heard of of :).
My objective now was to figure out how to punish b for his play.];W[fq]
L[ep]C[I  think the cut at `a' is also reasonable.  Expect to sacrifice something in  what follows,
but to get a good position as a result.];B[ep];W[cr];B[gq];W[fp];B[fo];W
[gp];B[hp];W[go];B[gn];W[ho]C[Making a ladder shape without a chance to  capture w cannot be good for b.
I was willing to keep doing it as long as he wanted to.

Quite right.];B[iq];W[gr];B[br];W[ds];B[hq];W[fn]L[in][eo]C[I think `a' is  better.  Save this cut until you decide whether you want to play
here or at `b' later on.];B[eo];W[fm];B[hn];W[io]C[I decided that pushing  along like this would help me even though it gives b
a big wall facing center.  It contains his lower group which becomes quite
weak.

This is where `a' would have helped a few moves back.];B[in];W[jo];B[jn]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[lo];B[mn];W[ln];B[lm];W[mm]L[mo]C[I think this is premature.   Pushing through at `a' is more in keeping with your plan
to isolate the lower black group, and you can still cut here later.];B[ml]
;W[nm];B[mo];W[ll]L[km][lq][lp][mq]C[I think you should save this cut for  later.  You can also cut at `a,' and it's

not yet clear which is better.  On the other hand, if you used this  opportunity

to attack the lower group (perhaps `b' works, with miai of `c' and `d'),  black's
position might collapse completely.];B[km];W[lk];B[nk];W[mi]L[mj]C[I think  `a' is actually better.]
;B[gl];W[fl];B[fj];W[ek];B[fh];W[fk]L[jj][gk][ol]M[ll][lk]C[Up to this point I felt I was way ahead.  This move was a mistake  and the sequence

that followed cost me dearly.  I think I should have pressed in front of b's  wall at
K10 (a), strengthening my marked stones in the process.


However, if you do not play either here or at `b', black plays `b,' and he is  out.

I _think_ `b' is a better choice.  Expect black to cut, and then sacrifice  and squeeze,
so the middle black group gets cut off with only one eye.

Also, consider snaring the two black stones on the right with a move like  `c.']

[jn][kn][km][lm]C[I think `a' might be a  better choice for running.  Pushing through at `b' is also

attractive.  (If necessary, sacrifice the marked white stones to capture the  marked
black stones.];B[jj];W[jk];B[ik];W[hi]L[gm]M[lm][km][kn][jn][in][hn]
[gn]C[This is a mistake.  I think you can still capture the marked stones  by pushing through  at `a.']

 rich 24k : doesn't work :(

Why doesn't black just atari at `a'?];W[kj];B[ji];W[hh];B[hg];W[gh];B[fi]
;W[ce]M[gh][hh][hi][gj][hj][ij]C[At this point I realized I had to way to  extract my marked group, so I had given b

a strong live group in the center.  This move was dual purpose: to stabalize  my left

group in the face of b's strength and to reduce b's potential territory  here.]
;B[cd];W[bk];B[bl];W[ck];B[gg]C[I was pleased when I saw this move of b  since it seems to be wasted
(I had already given those stones up for dead).  Maybe b was worried about
losing his f11 group, but it had more liberties than my h11 clump.

There is some aji there to worry about, though.  I think this is a solid
move by black, though it gives you sente.];W[mf]M[nm][mm]L[pc][ol]
[lq][jg]C[I  felt this was an important juncture of the game.  I was looking for a way to
reduce b's huge potential area and increase mine.  This looked like a good
sopt.  Where would you suggest?


Several things seem bigger:  (a) defend your upper right corner at `a,'  (b)
snare those worrisome black stones on the right with `b,' or (c) attack the

lower black group with `c.'  However, I think `c' needs to wait until your  marked
stones are out of danger.  Stabilizing your right center allows you to attack
either at `c,' or perhaps even as far into the top area as `d,' so it might be

the biggest move.  However, expect black to come out of the ensuing struggle  with
sente, and he will probably invade your upper right corner.];B[kf];W[ki]
L[lj]C[I was concerned about a possible cut at m10 (a), but in retrospect  closing off the
right side to b's invasion stones would have been bigger.];B[ql];W[qk]L[ok][pl]C[I  think `a' or `b' is called for here.];B[pl];W[on];B[qn]
;W[qo];B[rk];W[rj];B[rm];W[sk]M[mm][nm]L[pn][ro][om]C[I felt I could kill this invasion  outright, but I should have realized I was

in no position to start a ko.  Playing at q6 (a) would have forced w to  live and I could
have closed off the top and bottom in the process.


I think `b' still would have killed black, but threats against the marked  stones might
still have bought him another eye (e.g. he can play `c' in sente).];B[sl]

I think this is a mistake.  Just connect at `a,' and black is probably dead.]

L[lq]C[I don't buy this one.  `a' is a better threat.];B[gc];W[gb]C[I  think this is a bad idea.  Go back to the ko, and play this move as a threat  if you
think it's worth it.  (Actually, if I were black, I would ignore it.)];B
[sj];W[si];B[sk];W[qi]L[ri][rh]C[I prefer a solid connection at `a.'  This  connection allows black to get a stone in at `b,'

or three...).];B[ec];W[hc];B[gd];W[jb];B[jc];W[ic]C[I hate to say it, but  this invasion should not work.]

I felt b let me off pretty cheaply on the right.  It seems clear that my  invasion was

worth more than the points he stole.  I still felt b was ahead so I decided  to force
him to save his bottom group and give up a big corner to me.

Actually, the bottom group looks killable to me.];B[kp];W[mr];B[lq];W[lr]
