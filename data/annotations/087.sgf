;B[hm];W[mp];B[gk]L[go][hn][hp]M[gk]C[The marked stone is perhaps a bit early.  A  nice move in this situation is `a,' which  protects both cutting points, `b' and `c.']
;W[hr];B[gr];W[gq];B[ir];W[hp]C[White is now connected, but you may be able to form  a living group underneath,
and your situation in the middle would still be about the same.  See  variation.]

(;B[ip];W[iq];B[gp]L[jd]M[gp]C[The marked stone seems very small.  How about  a big point, like `a'?]
;W[hq];B[fp]L[jd][jc][qn]C[Still small.  Moves  like `a,' `b,' and `c' look best to me.]
;W[go];B[ep];W[hn];B[io];W[in];B[im]M[im]C[The marked stone is only good if you are trying to build  a central moyo and keep white  out of it.]
;W[jo];B[gm];W[gn]M[gm][gn]C[The exchange of marked  stones does little to help your position, but strengthens
white...not a good exchange.];B[pj]C[Good.  I'm glad you came out of the  lower left with sente.]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[qh];B[qe]L[qj][qn]M[qe]C[I think I prefer the ``steel  post'' at `a.'  If white defends above, you then have a nice
follow-up at `b.'  Note that the marked stone does not secure the corner.]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[rj];B[pl]L[pk][ok]C[I think the best connection  here is the solid one at `a.'  A white peep at `b' could
get white into your central moyo later.];W[qm];B[rk];W[rm];B[qf]M[qf]L[rg]C[The marked stone is slow.  Usually, the best undercutting move is a  knight's move, or  where possible, a long knight's move.  I think `a' is better here.]
;W[qg];B[nj]M[pj][pl][qk][rk]L[qq]C[I'm not sure I understand the purpose of this move.   Are you worried about the
marked stones?  They seem okay for now.  How about an invasion now at `a'?]
;W[oh];B[mh]L[qq][cd][cc]C[The marked white stones have  great shape now, and probably cannot be killed.
I think you should either defend or invade right now.  I still like the  invasion at
`a,' but a defense at `b' or `c' might be worth just as much.];W[rf];B[re]
;W[sf];B[se];W[rh];B[sh];W[si];B[rg];W[sg];B[on]C[I think you are approaching from the wrong direction.  If white  strengthens the corner,
you've lost your chance to invade.];W[pm];B[om];W[jd];B[gd]L[cc][gc]
[cd]M[jd]C[This is a  halfway move.  It does not attack white very strongly, nor does it defend
territory.  (White can still invade at `a.')  Somewhat better is `b,' which  undercuts
the marked white stone and has a tremendous follow-up at `c.'];W[md];B[mc]
;W[me];B[ne]L[lc]C[You are too set  on destruction.  Let white connect, but take `a' for yourself and
come out of the exchange with sente.];W[nc];B[lc];W[nf];B[mf]L[oc]C[I don't think  you can afford this with all of the cutting points in the corner.
Maybe `a'?];W[od];B[oe];W[pe];B[oc];W[qd];B[of];W[pg];B[ng];W[pc];B[od]
;W[qc];B[le]L[jf][if][ke]C[Too close.  It's best to capture all of the marked stones  on a large scale.  Perhaps
a move like `a' or `b'?  At the very least, to capture these two, play `c.']
