C[This game was submitted by TimBrent as black player without special request. I'll do the review mostly from this side without focusing on a peculiar subject.

(;B[qc]TR[pd][qf]C[R17 is usually played to protect the corner and settle the group when white comes with Q18.
Why not a move with the same purpose (claim the corner and settle the black group) that could offer more potential ?

See variations.

As there is no presure on the two marked stones ... black can also play elsewhere]
;W[qk]LB[hc:A][md:B]TR[nc][kd]C[White chose to invade the left side ... his top group is not sure yet and with his strong group in the upper right corner black could use that weakness latter invading arround A or with a threat around B.]

C[Black should have reinforce one of the two marked stones.]
;W[pf]TR[dh][no][fq][iq]C[From here both players forgot one thing ... a contact play has a defense purpose, and this doesn't looks like a defensive move.

Escaping toward the left side with group 2 gives a strong wall to white ... and a nearly safe big corner.

Trying to save all his groups, black helps white ...

Group 2 is not safe now ... a move arround the marked spots might be better : gives more space to the group and starting to build a moyo on the left side.]

Now black might be really carefull. White is really strong  at right side ... and in the center (3 marked stones). The left groups 4 and 5 might be difficult to attack now, and 6 can still escape toward the center.

[oo][qo][ro][so][op][qp][bq][ar][hr][ir][as][gs][is]C[Overall comment.

The most important at this level of play ... take time before each move to look at the whole board, an overall reading might help you to chose the "best" move. Each move should have at least a purpose, the more he have, the best he is.

Try this :
- does the last move change anything locally (liberties, life ... ie K6)
- status of your own groups
- free space to extend from your groups
- status of your opponent groups
and try to do it with a whole board thinking.

Especially before starting a fight, if there is a bigger move elsewhere ... play it !!! Your opponent will spend his stones to catch few of your own while you secure a big territorie.

Follow this path leads to the sente/gote relationship. A lot of moves from this game just offer the opponent to take sente.

Hope this will be usefull
