C[Overall comments on game - I think your biggest weakness is that you focus too much on what the opponent has, instead of focusing on what you could have, and the ways in which your opponent could attack you. 

Your priorities should be, in order: 
1. Always take care of your weak groups before making more weak groups.
2. Take points
3. Reduce your opponent, probably making more weak groups in the process.]

In the end, your L3 stone just gets swallowed up and wasted - it's basically as if you had passed instead of playing L3!]

If W got this move, he'd not have to defend the center group, and it would shrink B's territory considerably, as well.]
