PNH: Your opening was actually quite good. You built a large framework on the left while the white one on the right remained insecure for a long time. Maybe you and white made the opposite mistake. You tended to overconcentrate your stones and strength and white wasn't secure enough. This led to your relative lack in development at the start of the midgame. I've indicated most of the inaccuracies and mistakes that I could spot that were of general strategic importance. I have been silent on slight inaccuracies or tactical mistakes that only practice and experience are needed to correct.

I have shown some possible fighting sequences just to give you a rough idea of the possible use of strong positions and areas that you control. I have not attempted to find the very best moves for both sides, rather just moves that seemed moderately reasonable to me.]

(;B[ck]TR[kc][cj]C[PNH: This is feasible, but the usual joseki continuation has black continuing at the marked point.

Extending in front the the shimari, as you did, is good but it is a bit far.  It makes it easy for white to invade. See variations.]

(;W[ld];B[cn]TR[qc][nd][pd]C[The marked group is insecure now, because of the possibility of white s17. Black should s17 now instead of c6. Moves that make groups secure have precedence over big moves in the opening.

Considered in the local context, however, your c6 is perfect.]
;W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[en]TR[ck][cn][bp]C[This is not efficient. The marked group is perfectly safe. Now the four stones are overconcentrated considering the wide spaces still available on the board.

This move would be good if there were a competition between the black framework (moyo) on the left side and the white one on the lower side. However the white framework is not completed yet. Better destroy it than reduce it. E6 just induce white into playing where he would like to play anyway -- in the vicinity of k4.]
