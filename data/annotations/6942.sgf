Thanks alot for reviewing this game!!

This game was a very interesting one, for me. I was a little intimidated by my opponent and thought he played strong moves, generally. He resigned at the end, and to be honest I really can't tell why. I know I made alot of mistakes this game, so thanks for your help in finding them.

Hallo,
This was a nice game for you. From your remarks though I got the impression that you should try to improve you're assesement of the board during the game. E.g; at the end of the game it's clear that white is in a hopeless position, so you should'nt be surprised that he resigned. Also try to have an idea which groups are strong or weak, like the D13-E12 stones which could have been attacked by white.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[de];B[dp];W[nc];B[oc]C[Is this the right spirit? I like this joseki alot. What are some times when I shouldn't use it?

F: You don't see it to often so early in the game, but I wouldn't call it a mistake.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jc]C[F: The disadvantage is that white is settled and your corner is still open to invasion later on]
;B[fd];W[di];B[dg]C[In retrospect, this seems bad. Thoughts?

F: The white extension is a litte too loose, so invading is possible, but it can wait until later, there are other big points on the board]
;W[ef];B[eh];W[gf]
(;B[hc]C[F: I think you should play on the other side. See variation]

(;W[cn]C[F: White should first put more pression on the two black stones on the left. Seer variaion]

(;B[dn]TR[di]C[F: This is not the right idea. After finishing the joseki, the marked white stone is in a ideal position. See var.]

(;W[pj]C[F: What about taking the left side];B[mp];W[on];B[jo]
;W[lq]C[Ok, here things get interesting. Please let me know what you think of the fighting that follows.

F: This seems rather greedy.];B[mq]C[F:OK];W[lp];B[lo]C[F: OK]
;W[mr]
(;B[mo]C[F: Not good, this is much to easy for white. See variations]
;W[or];B[nr];W[lr];B[ns]C[You separated white, but you still have a cutting point, and white has sente to try saving his stones on the left]
;W[iq]
(;B[jq]C[F: Better starting from the outside. See var.];W[jr]

;B[er];W[hr];B[dq];W[hp];B[is];W[hs];B[js];W[go]C[F: Compare this result with one of the earlier variations. In both cases, white lives, but here, you have more than 10 point less.]

F: You should try to attack the white stones in the middle]
;W[ij];B[ji];W[ii];B[ql]C[I'm very bad at three space invasions. Should this one be possible?

F: It should be on Q8 (one to the left), but it should be possible]
;W[pm]C[F: If you invaded at Q8, you could escape to the centre now, but here that's not possible]

(;W[jj]C[F: White should continue fighting on the right side.  If black can take this 3 white stones, the game is over.]

----------------------

He resigns here, but it is unclear that he is losing at all. If I count correctly, I am ahead by a handful of points. 5 - 10 ish, I'd say, but those could be grabbed in the yose, perhaps?

Thanks again for taking the time to review this game.

F: I count almost 70 pointsfor you and 31 for white, so your lead is much bigger than you thought.]
