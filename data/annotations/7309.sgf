C[Hi, reviewer.
Thank you for taking your time to review this game.  I played white in the game, and I wasn't sure how to play against tengen.

forfun (hereafter ff) - First of all, thanks for an interesting game.  It was fun to analyze and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Since White wins and submitted it with questions about how to play against Tengen, I will concentrate on the earlier stages of the game.  A friend of mine likes to play Tengen and "near-Tengen" openings from time to time, so I have a fair amount of experience trying to counter center plays.  I find it very interesting to have to think differently about the board as a whole.  There are some comments and uncommented variations toward the end of the game as well but do not trust them too much - I don't! :-)]
;B[jj]C[ff - Black starts at the point of symmetry, K10.  This certainly takes the game out of the usual paths.  However, Black can not strictly control the course of the game over the next few plays.  The major choices that will set the structure will be divided between White and Black because Tengen tends to be gote.  Let's see what I mean on the next play...]

(;W[pp]C[ff - White chooses to play in a corner.  The alternative is to respond directly against the Tengen stone.  See the variation...]
;B[dp]C[ff - Black plays in an adjacent corner to White's stone on Q4.  This is unusual since it lets White decide whether to play around D16 and prevent a Black moyo or to play around Q16 and play against a Black moyo.  More often Black plays in the D16 corner.]

(;W[de]C[ff - White plays in this area.  Now it is difficult for Black to use the Tengen to build a moyo.  The K10 stone will have to justify itself through fighting.

See the variation...];B[pd]C[ff - This position occurred at least twice in Japanese pro games in the 1930's.  See the variation on the next play...]

(;W[cn]C[ff - A fighting approach.  See the variation...]
(;B[dk]C[ff - Naturally Black can not respond in the corner...]

(;W[cq]C[ff - The result of this looks reasonable to me.  However, let's also look at some other alternatives...]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[fq];B[cg]C[I wasn't sure how to respond to this. Thought about playinging d13 to make b overconcentrated. Would that be better?

ff - The key point to understand is that up to here the Black stone on Tengen looks out of place.  White should not have to try too hard.  

When Black approaches the D15 stone from this side, there has to be a special reason.  Otherwise Black is in danger of giving up too much in the corner.  Here the "special reason" is the need to make sense out of the stones played up to now.  This is not so easy in the case of the K10 stone.

See the variations to the next play...]
(;W[dc]C[ff - Good read.  I was surprised to discover through a check against my database (GoGoD) that this is the most frequent reply by White to a Black approach at  C13!  I would not have picked it myself, but obviously that is one reason I can't play at a pro level :-)]
;B[cd]C[ff - In pro games Black is more concerned with playing in front of the White shimari than invading the corner.  Here Black plays a narrow move from strong stone on C13.]
;W[dd];B[ce]C[Tempted to play C17, but it seemed small and good for b to get D14.

ff - Your instincts were not so bad, maybe better than you logic! :-)  Let's take a look...]

(;W[df]C[ff - This looks reasonable in this position.  However, there is a key issue that White missed during the game - the ladder that White can apply to the stone on C13.  White should not be willing to simply let Black sieze the corner, leaving the White wall without a base.]
;B[cc]C[ff - This is an overplay by Black.  See the variations for White on the next play...]

(;W[dg]C[ff - This is a very poor play on White's part.  It is a classic example of "aji keshi", erasing the potential in this position.]
;B[ch]C[ff - White forces Black to fix the defect in the Black position.  Now the upper left corner belongs to Black and is equal to White's lower left. White's wall can be undercut by the hane at D18, therefore its potential is limited.  White is in difficulties here.]

(;W[id]C[Wanted k16/17, but thought it might be too far considering k10. What's the best extension?

ff - This clearly looks to narrow.  The conventional wisdom is, "Height of the wall plus one", which would be L16 (or L17) rather than J16.  Here White's wall has not base in the corner and that the Tengen stone is waiting to play a role in the fighting from any invasion.  Therefore White may want to be more conservative.]
;B[lc];W[fp];B[fo]
(;W[bn]C[Maybe just g5?

ff - This looks like an overplay after White forced Black to play C12...]

(;B[dn]C[ff - What was White planning to do if Black played the hane at A6?...]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[en];B[do]
(;W[ao];B[bm];W[an];B[em]
(;W[pj]C[ff - White gives up on the left side for now, but there seem to be defects in Black's position...]
;B[fb];W[gd];B[hc]
(;W[hd]C[ff - I think this response is too passive.  White has to try harder here.  See the variation...]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[jb];W[jd];B[kc]C[ff - When Black crosses under at the top, the White stones in the upper left lose almost all potential to make territory.  They are a burden on White.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[ek];B[dl];W[lj]C[ff - White plays with fire here.  However, White needs complications.  If White simply make eyes for the group on the left, Black will win on territory.]

(;B[lk]C[ff - The urgent question in the current position is the life of the White stones on the left.  This is a mistake in direction the allows White to struggle back into the game.]
;W[kk];B[kj];W[kl];B[ll]C[ff - Black undertakes a strategy to sacrifice the two stones at K10 and L10.  Finally we see the fate of the original play on Tengen... it becomes part of a central territory created by White.]

(;W[qc]C[ff - Basically White can expect to either play here or prevent a Black invasion at R3, but not both.  So this is not necessarily the largest point.]
;B[ko];W[il]C[ff - This is much too tight.  It should have been at J6 I think.]
;B[ik];W[ij];B[jk]
(;W[hj]C[ff - This is a major tactical oversight by White.  Which White stones are weak and which are strong?  Black sets out to demonstrate that the lower side stones are weak...

See the variations for White's alternatives...];B[jl];W[im]
;B[jm];W[jn];B[in];W[jo];B[hl]
(;W[hm]C[ff - White is too optimistic in reading out the fight here.  See the variation...]

See the variation...];W[hr];B[fr];W[dr];B[qd]
(;W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[qi];W[qm];B[pq]C[Is blocking the other side better?

ff - I think this is a hard question.  If both sides play typical continuations, White ends up cutting around M5 and can get a big lead.  However, White has to expect that Black will fight hard using the threat to cut off the three White stones on the right side.

See the variations...]

;B[in];W[jo]C[ff - White has answered passively to Black on both the top and the bottom.  Black has secured about 60 points on the left side.  However, White has about as much on the top and bottom.  The relative inefficiency of the Black stones on D9 and K10 are hurting Black at this point.]

(;W[dg]C[ff - This looks interesting and is a more direct attempt to show that the Tengen stone is misplaced...]

(;B[dh]C[ff - Black answers passively at D12.  This is unlikely to give a sufficient return since the D9 and K10 stones are already on the board...]

(;B[ch]C[ff - Black answers passively and becomes overconcentrated on the left side...]
;W[fe]C[ff - Through something like this, White makes the Black left side overconcentrated.  The big issue is that the upper left corner is still obviously open to a Black invasion.  However, this looks playable to me.]

(;B[fe]C[ff - Black really needs to be more aggressive...];W[ch]
;B[fc]C[ff - Black goes all out to construct a framework that employs the K10 stone.  This looks very loose and will inevitably result in heavy fighting, but at least has a certain strategic sense to it.  White's original idea with D15 of preventing Black from forming a big moyo has gone astray.  Here the block at C14 does not look so interesting, although depending on style White may be satisfied.]

(;W[eg]C[ff - Alternative 2, White stands.  I think this makes more sense as a counter measure with the K10 stone on the board...]
;B[cf];W[ce]C[ff - White needs to be careful about Black pushing through and cutting because there is more room for the cutting stones to survive along the top.  However, if Black tries to push through immediately...]

;B[bc];W[bb];B[dh];W[eg]C[ff - White does not break into the left side but Black does not take the corner like the previous variation.  Black's stone on K10 is out of place while White has a lot of power facing along the top.  I think White is satisfied.]

;B[kd];W[qi];B[ip];W[dj];B[nq]C[ff - This is the continuation from one of the games.  White plays to limit Black's ability to form a moyo using the stone on Tengen.  Black then has to try to get maximum value from the Tengen stone in fighting.]
