C[I played that game with black. I felt like I lost it during the early fuseki. I think that my opponent played some overplays but I was not able to counter them.

pajaro: Hi. I'll do my best to help you understand what happened. I'll start my comments with 'pajaro']

(;W[fc]C[I think white move is a mistake. There's no so much development perspective for him on upper edge.

pajaro: Right. The usual is to approach from the open side.]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[df];W[ie]C[Odd move ? I didn't really understood white aim. In fact, that move reinforce k16 stone.

pajaro: White is trying to play lightly, because he's already under attack. Black must be happy to have a target.]
;B[id];W[he];B[je]C[I feel rather confortable here. I think that the only move for white now is F14, but...]
;W[nd]C[This is the beginning of the nightmare for me. I didn't want to play Q14 because then, white on O14 would split my 2 black groups. Maybe it was a bit coward ?

pajaro: White should end with 2 weak groups. Black, happy again.]
;B[ne]C[I expect to build a wall with white N16, black N15, etc.

pajaro: Don't touch what you want to attack. Even if you get a wall, white will be safe and you won't have an attack anymore.]
;W[me]C[But white plays here. A bit too much tricky for me.

pajaro: This is expected. That's why b doesn't have to play on contact. White can sacrifice some stones, but aims to make a good shape.]

(;B[md]C[pajaro: This is exactly what white wants. White will escape easily. Better was P15.]
;W[mc];B[ld];W[oe];B[nf];W[od]C[black corner is suffering.
I hesitated between R15 to try to save the corner and M14 to settle the black group on the center

pajaro: Yes, the corner suffers. Notice that w gave up N15 without hesitating. B needs to make life with his Q16 stones.]

(;B[lf]C[pajaro: This is wrong. The corner is bigger. W won't try to save N15, because that stone has little value and will be a burden for him. Even if he does, saving O15 is not as important as saving the corner.]
;W[pc]
(;B[qf]C[pajaro: This won't save the corner, it just makes the loses smaller. Instead, take the chance and attack the w weak group. See the var.]
;W[pe];B[qd];W[qe]C[The corner is lost for me. I think the game is already lost.

pajaro: It's move #28... don't give up yet!];B[ff]C[pajaro: good!]
;W[hd];B[jq]C[pajaro: Why?? White is still weak. Keep on pressing! While b is attacking, w won't have time to play big points.]
;W[lq]
(;B[gq]C[pajaro: For my taste, this is short. See var.];W[eq]
C[pajaro: Now white is strong on both sides. He will attack.]
;B[cn]C[pajaro: Wrong direction. G3-K3 are weak. You have to reinforce. Also, D4 is quite stable, so an attack to it will have little effect.]

(;B[cr]C[pajaro: This move is small. Black is already alive. Leave these small moves for yose, when all groups are settled.
Better defend C6.];W[cl]C[pajaro: W attacks. It is expected...]
;B[eo];W[ep];B[en]C[pajaro: E5 was kikashi (forcing move). After you play it, forget that stone. Don't try to save it. If in the future it helps, fine. But don't make it a burden.]

;W[kl];B[ko];W[kp];B[jo];W[kj];B[mo];W[lp]C[pajaro: All these 3-4 last moves are small for both sides.]
