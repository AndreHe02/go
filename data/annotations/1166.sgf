C[I would like you to comment on White's  moves. I really don't know what rank I have  since I have only played a handful of  games and never in a club. I played  several game with an 1k who said I was  about 8k. Following are my comments on  some of my moves. Thank you for taking  the time to comment on this game.]

C[Instead of playing W14, I believe I should  have played A. Correct?

You are right.
As B11 is on the third raw, he cannot expect too much territory  on the upper side.
A White stone at P4 would be even better in my oppinion as it
also sets black under preasure.
It you want to play something at the upper side, G17 would be
the right point.];B[jq];W[fc]C[This is not a good move, as it strengthens black and not white.]
;B[ec];W[lb];B[oq];W[cj]C[I thought it best to play here now so as to  restrict B's shimari in the upper left.  Correct?

seems ok];B[qm];W[rl]C[Too early for end game.
Something like H3 is much better.];B[rm];W[ol]C[I often play this combination, 22 and 24. 22  to keep B from invading from below and 24  to expand my moyo and also to later  restrict B from extending in the middle.
I have the feeling that 22 is more of an  endgame move though.

Well, H3 threatens to build a larger moyo then P8 does.
It also prevents a black move there.
The white group to the left hand side is strong enough at this moment.]
;B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[gq];W[hn];B[cm]C[Too deep.
somethink like E10 would be ok to reduces whites framework.]
;W[dm]C[Just strengthening black.
Capture the large way by playing E10.];B[ch];W[cl]C[I thought 34 was necessary to keep B from  starting a fight that would, at the very least  split me in two.

E10 still better.
The two white groups are strong enough.];B[mp];W[od]C[Aji Keshi.
this only helps black.

Better something like E11or K6
F18 would be ok now, too.];B[oc];W[nd];B[mc]C[Splitting your own groups apart.]
;W[lc];B[md];W[pd];B[rc];W[mf];B[ld];W[kd];B[ke];W[jd]C[Should 48 have cut B?

No
White's group is too weak for fighting.];B[je];W[ie];B[lf];W[me]
C[Why not N13 if you want to play there further

And E11 and K6 are still better then any store at that area.]
;B[le];W[mh];B[fd];W[gc];B[qh]C[too deep again];W[rf]C[I am also interested if I handled B's  invasion correctly.

Well, it's ok
but you can also stay away as black cannot achive something there.]
;B[oj];W[qi];B[ql];W[pk];B[pi];W[mk]C[This is good

capturing and gaining territory as well
Now black is punished for his mistake.];B[ph];W[ri];B[ip]C[Why would B move here?]
;W[ei]C[finally :-)];B[eq];W[ep]C[D4 beter here.];B[dr];W[cq]
;B[jn];W[pn]C[Thinking that I was secure in the middle  right side, I wanted to keep B from taking  this as territory.

Well, black will gain teritory there.
Something like P6 would be better as it is connected allready]
;B[nl];W[ok];B[nk];W[nj];B[rh];W[pj];B[oi];W[mj];B[ml];W[om]
;B[nn];W[rn]C[This is only Gote.
Something like C14 or C2 is much larger.];B[qn];W[sm];B[qo]
;W[sk];B[ll];W[jj]C[This move does nothing,

if you want to secure territory try J8];B[il]C[... as you can see now.]
;W[hl]C[I believe attaching is wrong. Correct?

The mistake is not here, but one white stone earlier.];B[hk]
C[J7 now would keep some more territory.];W[gl];B[ik];W[gk]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[mg];W[ng];B[nf];W[ne];B[kh];W[hj];B[ij]C[Cutting at O12 would now lead to a heavy fight, where black woud win much more then he does with this move.]
;W[hi]C[All this stones in the middle secure only very few point (if at all)
Something like C2 or C14 is much larger.];B[ii]C[Somehow I have the nagging feeling I  could have connected the left and right  sides. If I had attached or played so close  to B, I could have connected.

It is not neccessary to conect them as they can live on their own.
Connecting here only means playing on neutral points.];W[nh]
;B[bi];W[bj];B[og];W[of];B[ni];W[mi];B[on];W[pm]C[Unnessesary.

Just one stone
D13 much larger];B[po];W[ro];B[rp];W[rj]C[I thought this was necessary to keep the  group alive.

it is ok.];B[lk];W[hg]C[Again a stone in the middle
D13 or still C2 are much better.];B[ih];W[hh];B[cr];W[br];B[gd]
;W[hd];B[gf];W[eg];B[cf]C[Is this the beginning of the endgame? I see  only moves where W or B can whittle down  the other side rather then making any  really big moves. I feel very lost in the  endgame.

The endgame started many moves before, when all groups were alive.
Now white is allreay behind about 20 points.
>From now on not even a medium sized mistake like in the lower left can
help white winning the game.
In my oppinion the best white can do here is resign.];W[im]
