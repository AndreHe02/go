AB[pd][dp]C[JFR:  Hi I am John and I played black in this game.  I feel like I came out of the opening with a strong lead (I ended up winning by a small margin due to a largo moyo).  Move 47 started an invasion sequence that was bad for me.  Also, I am interested in the bottom right corner formation and how I could have played better there.

I am interested in any comments you have on the game but don't feel like you have to comment on everything.  I am mainly interested in white's invasion on the right side, and the bottom right corner situation (life and death, when to cut and defend, etc)

Thank You!


-------------

Review by burrito [2k\]:  See comments in game.   

I would pay particular attention to moves 46 and 28 as the reason your position was hard to defend when white invaded.  When white did come in, you should have been thinking about how to attack the invasion while profiting.  You should be happy that white invaded like that and built your position around him living small.  

As for the bottom right corner, white should be able to live there.  It's a tricky position for white to play though, and I've messed it up in more than one game.  Still, as black in that position, you should be also be happy to let white live with 2 points in the corner while you profit massively on the outside.

I can show some variations for how white can defend that position if you are curious, but since I'm already late with the review, I thought it better to get this out sooner.  Thanks for being patient!]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[fc];B[fd]TR[dj]C[I've been taught by stronger players that attaching like this is generally not very good unless black also has a stone in the triangled area.  I confess I can't give a convincing argument against it except to say that in general contacting an opossing stone makes that stone stronger.  So white will get a stronger position and without the extra stone on the right, black doesn't build as much.  Just something to think about]
;W[cc];B[dc]C[white C17 is very odd.  Splitting your opponent is probably the right way to go here.  A couple of points though

First, if you had a stone around C10 to support f16, you could block the other way very profitably

Second, you'll notice that your opponent has now made your stones a bit over-concentreated.   Wouldn't you now prefer F16 as a pincer?]
