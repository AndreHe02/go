C[Hi . My main cocern in the game is my mistakes during the middle 
game (I think i did well in fuseki and yose ) ,especially about 
the direction of play. I played black . Both player is 6k KGS 
.

A few times in the game, i thought i'd had an easy game , which 
obviously turn out to be wrong . This also made me do some fairly 
silly things (like trying to play a taisha joseki ).

Another thing i want to ask is , since i become 6k , my games 
often happen in two way : I manage to kill a big enemy group 
(which would lead to a 50 points+ win , obviously the opponent 
resigned ), or i let one of my big group died, and resigned . 
I hardly find any game that i win/lose by a small margin . I 
feel a little bit uneasy about this . I just want to know if 
my style is too aggressive ? Normally , the combat begin because 
i must do a single handed invasion in to big framework .

I also would like to know if you have any advice / book suggestions 
for me.
Thank in advance



Hello, my name is Arnaud Boucherie. I play as ExplO on KGS, if you have anymore questions you can ask me there.

In this game it does not look like your style is too aggressive. Except for the idea of playing taisha none of your moves looked unreasonnable. The moves of your opponent looked more aggressive than yours.

I agree that you had a very good opening but I think the endgame was better for your opponent.

As for study, try reading Attack and defense by James Davies, it should help improving your middlegame. Also, you said that you have a poor reading. If you don't do tsumego regularly, try to do so. It may be a little boring at first but it becomes more enjoyable after a while and it's really worth it in the end.

Thanks for sharing the game.

I will start all my comments with AB];B[qd];W[dq];B[pq];W[cd]
;B[od];W[qk];B[qn];W[qh];B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[cf]
;B[kc]C[AB:If you want to play this extension, it's better to play the hanging connection at G16 instead of F16. Now if white invades at J17, the F17 stones may be under attack.]
;W[mc]
(;B[md]C[Should i block at O17 instead ? In "Lessons in the Fundamentals 
of go" , block at O17 is count as bad move ,"because it divide 
you group into two halfs" (the reason in the book ) . Honestly 
, i still cant really understand the reason . Another thing is 
that i worried about an invasion at H17 or J17 , which would 
make the game into a complete fighting mess .

AB: If you play O17, white won't get a base and will need to escape in the center but you will be separated so you must evaluate whether or not it will be easy for you to take care of the two groups.
The play in the game forces white to live at the top, it destroys more of you points, you cannot attack the white stones any longer, but you connect all your stones thickly.
So when white invades, you have to estimate which result is better for you. In the game, white already has a two space extension on the right side, so it's difficult for you to make use of thickness if you let white live at the top.
See variation if you try P17];W[ld];B[lc];W[nd];B[me];W[ne]
;B[nc];W[oc];B[mb];W[pd];B[oe];W[pe];B[of];W[pc];B[pf];W[qe]
;B[qf];W[re];B[rf];W[qc]C[AB: White moves after the invasion were a bit odd. This result is really good for you because you have sente and your position is really solid. Now the white group on the right looks weak.]
;B[qj]C[Ab: But this is bad. Contact moves are not attacking moves. When you play contact moves, both sides must defend their stones. So now you have to defend R10 while white becomes stronger, it's not good.
To attack this group, it's better to cap at P9 and see what white does. It would be difficult for white live while not making your lowr right corner stronger or letting you have more stones in the center.]
;W[pj];B[qi];W[pi];B[rh];W[ph];B[rg];W[rk];B[ri];W[nf]C[The first silly mistake , i "thought" the ladder is working , 
so i didnt read it ....

AB: the stones at Q10 are not strong enough for white to try this plan.]
;B[ng];W[mf];B[oh];W[le];B[mc];W[lf]C[AB: At this point you only have to look after your stones at O13 while white is weak on both sides, it will be hard for white to keep everything.]
;B[pk]C[AB: Good move.];W[pm];B[ok];W[qm];B[oj];W[pn];B[qo]
;W[po];B[pp];W[mq]C[AB: White is looking for trouble again.]
;B[np]C[AB: Good, you must keep the white stones separated.]
;W[nq];B[op]C[AB: but this move is too soft. So far all your stones are strong so you can afford to let black cut here and play a more attacking move like N4 or O6.]
;W[mm];B[id]C[AB: you can also play at L4 to attack the two white stones at the bottom. It will be hard for white to defend the bottom and the right side at the same time. You played a very solid P4, you have to make use of it.]
;W[ic];B[hd];W[mp];B[nm];W[nn];B[mn];W[nl];B[no];W[om];B[mo]
;W[mj];B[lh]C[AB: You can also attack the bottom..];W[mh];B[mg]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[lg];B[mi];W[jp];B[kg]C[AB: This is too small. You are already clearly alive on both sides so these stones are not worth than there capture (16 points). If you want to capture them, it's better to aim at making it on a large scale, for example by playing E13. Even if you don't manage to capture them you should get enough compensation while white escues them.]
;W[kh];B[nh]C[AB: Blunder, must be at M11 so that white cannot squeeze as in the game.]
;W[li];B[mh];W[nj];B[og];W[kf]C[AB: white should sacrifice his stones instead.]

;W[hi];B[ki]C[May be i should just continue to push at  H11? Will it make the white moyo too big ? 
From now on , i cant seem to find my mistakes . There are a few moves i made just to ensure that the opponent wont try to overplay (which i hate , because of my poor reading) .

AB: Your move is fine. White gets some sente moves but there is no aji.]
;W[ii];B[jh];W[ji];B[kh];W[kj];B[lj]C[AB: looks slow];W[lk]
;B[co]C[AB: good direction, but maybe better one line further so that it's easier for you to settle. Here white has many stones around so a pincer may be difficult to handle.]
;W[jk]C[AB: white has no time for this.];B[fp]C[AB: Too many white stones around to try this kind of things. Settling the things peacefully by playing D4 or C3 is good enough.]

;B[ca];W[cb];B[da];W[ba];B[ea];W[bc];B[rn]C[AB: No reason not to play hane at S7 instead. If white does not answer the best you can do is S7 anyway, by in the game white gets a chance to play it.]
