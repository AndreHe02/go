C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
So far a completely even situation, with very standard joseki.]
;B[qf];W[ph];B[qh]TR[nc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

"Attack from a distance..."

I think O17 would have been better, establishing more points of "invation" while threathening to cut off Q16 from the rest of the board.]
;W[qi]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

"...defend with contact moves."

R11 is the correct follow up for white.];B[qg];W[re]TR[nc][mc]
[md]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
A play on the second line this early?  Perhaps sub-optimal.  I think an extention on the other side of the corner would have been better.]
;B[nc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
The right idea, but not as effective now as it could have been.]
;W[fq]TR[kc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
D4 is strong.  Q16 is weakened.  I would think O17 is sente "enough" to answer it.  L 17 would remove O17's potential for a base. (For now.)]
;B[of]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Ignoring F3 and carrying on the attack in the opposite corner? Very good.]
;W[pf]TR[oc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
The R14 group is already secured.  It cannot be cut off.  P17 would make a base for life in the corner.]
;B[pg]TR[pe]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I think Q15 would have been a stronger attack.  Followed by a connection at R15.  The white cut on P16 is nothing to fear because of the atari waiting on P17 and the weak position that would leave Q16 in.]
;W[pe];B[og]TR[oh]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
P13 is thicker than needed and a waste of an opportunity.  P12 would have made the same connection AND put a little more pressure on white.]
;W[oh];B[pb]TR[kc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I think I'd prefer L17 here.  Not as agressive, but it would secure a base for black.]
;W[qc]TR[lc][kc][nd]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Perhaps it would be better to stop creeping into the corner and instead push black from another angle?  With the two beginnings of corner invations I'd consider playing L17 and follow up with S4 and/or D2.]
;B[oe]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
A very strong move locally.  But I feel it's too thick.  Besides, large parts of the board are yet unclaimed.  There are bigger points to grab elsewhere.]
;W[ip]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Okay, but defensive.];B[kq];W[jq]TR[dn][dr]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I think K3 is small.  I would go for the corner.  D6 looks a bit more interesting to me than D2.]
;B[kp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Small.];W[kr]TR[jc][kc][ce][dn][rp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Small, giving black sente when he replies on M2.  And we KNOW he will, right?
I've marked a few better moves.];B[lr];W[jr];B[dm]TR[cm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Good!  But keep in mind that there's still room for a white invation with all your stones on the fourth line.  C7 would make you even stronger and the same number of stones would take up more space.]
;W[ic]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
The right idea, but too short.  This lets black have room for a two-point extension.]
;B[kc];W[be];B[bf];W[dr]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
40 moves.  Black looks stronger and is about 30 moku ahead.  White is dead in the upper right corner.]
;B[cq];W[eo];B[do];W[en]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This is forcing black to make his position stronger, and is probably better for black than white.]
;B[dn];W[ls]TR[mp][rp][ce]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Pointless.  I've marked a few suggestions that at least would make sense.]
;B[ms];W[jb];B[kb]TR[rb]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Better to ignore K18 and secure the kill in the corner.];W[qb]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Very good.  This brings the corner group back to life.];B[oc]
TR[jc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Pointless.  Pushing white back with K17 is better.  And it has a good follow-up on J16.]
;W[pc]TR[od]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I think I'd go for the cut instead.  No point in making things too easy for black.]
;B[od];W[ob];B[nb];W[pa];B[ke];W[jd]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This is forcing black to reinforce his position again.];B[kd]
;W[rp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
GOOD!  A move we've been waiting for...

60 moves.  White has made life in the doomed corner and gained some influence.  White is a bit too thin in the upper left corner, black is way too thick around N16.  Black has secured a huge mojo on the left flank with no interference from white.  Still, right now white is ahead with perhaps 10 moku.]
;B[qq];W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[eg]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This exchange is ok for both sides.];W[mg];B[mf];W[lg];B[kg]
;W[kh]TR[lf]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
M14 is stronger.];B[jg];W[jh];B[he];W[ig];B[if];W[jf]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Very good!  Divide and conquer.];B[kf]TR[je]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Let it go.  It's only two stones.  Play K15 and snake into white territory.]
;W[hf]TR[je]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Not good.  Connect on K15, keep black divided.];B[je]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Yes!];W[hh];B[gf];W[gg];B[hg];W[ih];B[fg]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This has turned into a terrible onslaught from black.  White should not have given away K14 in move 78.]
;W[gh];B[ff];W[ee];B[on];W[po]TR[mr]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Consider N2 instead!!!];B[oo];W[ko];B[lo]TR[fm][ep][qo][lh]
[jo]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I don't like M5.  It's gote and it's playing white's game.  Locally K5 is better.  I've marked a few strong moves elsewhere.]
;W[kn]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
White leads...];B[ln]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
...and black follows like a dog on a leash.
This is better for white than for black, it's not a neutral exchange. So black should look for better moves, or at least moves that aren't the ones white want black to make.]
;W[lq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Very good.  And a nasty surprise for black.  Nice how it turns the doomed M1 into an asset.  Still -as I very much doubt this was planned when M1 got played- I think M1 was a pointless move at the time.  A very good example of a dead 1/2 moku stone having lots of aji all the same!]
;B[ks]TR[lp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
No!  Connect at M4, keep white low.  You must see what a disaster the cut on M4 will be.]
;W[js]TR[lp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
What the hell?!  K1 is not only a gift to black, it's bending over backwards.  You started a wonderful attack with M3.  Follow it up!]
;B[mq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Correct.];W[lm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
100 moves.  Seems you're well matched opponents with different strengths and weaknesses.  This makes for an interesting game. And probably an opportunity to learn for both.
I consider white to be 15 moku ahead.  Most of the board is claimed but there's some neutral territory in the centre.  The right flank depends a lot on whom plays there first.
Black needs to expand, white needs to consolidate.];B[mm];W[ek]
TR[dk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
A move for influence in the centre.  Wise.  But I think D9 would have been better.]
;B[dk];W[el];B[em];W[fm];B[ej];W[dl];B[cl];W[fk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This skirmish turned out better for black.];B[fj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Good!];W[gj];B[gk];W[fl];B[hj];W[gi];B[hl];W[gl];B[hk];W[fn]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
From here...  ==>];B[ll]TR[km];W[km];B[jl];W[kl];B[kk];W[jp]
;B[mk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
==> ...to here I think white plays surprisingly defensive.  Black gains a lot and white doesn't exploit weak stones black have or good cuts to make.  Suddenly black is ahead.  Not only that, white now has two weak groups to save: L12 and L5.]
;W[rh]TR[lp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
At this point S12 is hardly interesting.  Kill with M4, forcing black to play N4, and take sente.]
;B[pi];W[oi];B[pm]TR[lp][lh][pj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Errr....  No.  The cut on Q11 was great.  Especially as it coldly ignored S12.  Run to Q10.  Any direction white may give chase is good for black.  I also think M4 and M12 would be better.]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[ok];B[ol]TR[ql]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Push white down and towards the edge instead.];W[ql];B[jk]TR[lp]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
M4!];W[ng]TR[lp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
M4!];B[nf];W[lf];B[le];W[lh];B[ep];W[fp];B[er];W[eq];B[qo];W[ro]
;B[ri];W[pj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
150 moves.  There's been a period where both sides seem undecided and lacking plans.  Borders have been drawn or reinforced but no real attacks have happened lately.
Both sides could probably have secured a comfortably lead during the last 20 moves.  As it stands now you're even.]
;B[rg];W[rj];B[si];W[sj];B[sh];W[qp];B[pq];W[lp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Finally!];B[mp];W[ls]TR[in][hm][nl][pn][lj][gd][id][hf][ce]
[dq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Not achieving anything.  The markings are a few moves to consider and lots of points of interest to look closer at.  I know you can figure out which is which.
Some are interesting in themselves, some can be made interesting by a planned sequence of moves.]
;B[mr]TR[jc][mi][ce]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Saving a very small point.  If you played one (any one) of the three marked points, do you think white would capture M2, or perhaps answer your move?]
;W[nm];B[ml];W[mj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Good.];B[hn]TR[jc][ce]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Good.  But compare H6 with C15 and K17.  Perhaps one of the other would make a bigger gain?]
;W[ho];B[jc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Yes.];W[ib]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Well done.];B[id];W[hc];B[gd]TR[ce]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
No.  G16 is a small provocation.  Perhaps suitable as a ko-threath. C15 is a full-fledged attack.]
;W[gc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This is ok under the circumstances.];B[fd]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
C15 is better.];W[im]TR[ce]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
C15 is important.];B[hm]TR[ce]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]

;B[bb]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
A well done takeover in the corner by black.];W[rr]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
A fairly big point this far into the game.
C2 is also good, but S2 is bigger.];B[qr];W[rq];B[fi];W[fh]
;B[eh];W[ck]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
What can be gained by this?];B[cj]TR[dj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Connect.  There'll be plenty of time to kill the white invation.]
;W[dj];B[ei];W[kj]TR[bk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
You managed to break through.  Keep up the invation.];B[db]
TR[dk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Retake the ko.];W[dc]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
200 moves.  An important ko-fight will decide wether black's border holds or white's invation succeeds.  The score is even.]

Very good.  It's important to get rid of C9 now.];W[ik];B[il]
;W[lj];B[lk];W[pn];B[om]TR[nk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I tihink O9 is better.];W[nk];B[nn]TR[nl]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Cut and kill!];W[jj];B[dq];W[fr];B[br];W[es];B[gn]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Maybe it's time to consider the white group around G19.  So far it's one-eyed.  G19, H19 and K19 are points to consider for an invation or a reduction.  Maybe you can turn it into a ko-fight. Even if the group survives you might gain elsewhere.]
;W[go];B[gm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Wasting a ko-threat.];W[fo];B[ks]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
1/2 moku........];W[bs]TR[nl]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Save O8.];B[ar];W[nl];B[mn];W[ka];B[la];W[ja];B[lb]TR[fb][gb]
[hb][ia][ha][ga][fa]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
M19 is safe.  It can run to O18.  Even if it looks safe I'd try invading the big white group.]

A nice game with good victories and humiliating blunders on both sides.  You both played secure and very standard openings and had a decent endgame with the right priorities.  Seems to me both lost the grip in the mid-game and more or less played gote replies to gote moves.
Make plans.  Follow them.
Place aji stones within enemy territory.
Exploit cuts much more agressively.
Remember you can ALWAYS play elsewhere.
Read out complex situations!  Had any one of you taken the time to do that in the mid-game you'd won clearly.]
