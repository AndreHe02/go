;B[pd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[dj];W[pj];B[jd];W[jp];B[oh]C[Black's move doesn't secure the corner. Instead it allows white
to slide in. If black plays R12 instead then black is attacking
white whilst making his own position stronger and larger. Consider
similar moves such as F17, C14 and G3.];W[qh];B[pf]C[Note that after Q14 black leaves an "open skirt". The top right
corner is still open to erasure. Later white can play S14, devaluing
black corner. Q14 is the correct defence to R12, but if P12 had
been at R12 the sequence would have been avoided.];W[fc];B[gd]
C[Again black leaves an open skirt. Later white could play H18
or H17 or possibly J18. White should wait until the corner is
strengthened. Black needs to remember that making terratory against
the edges if far more efficient than making it in the center.
The usual rule is take corners, then edges before grabbing central
areas. Black's stone would be better placed at H17, but C14 or
G3 also look good.];W[gc]C[Now that white has gone underneath black's stone, black must
respond, or his potential area (moyo) will be destroyed. From
this position white could jump all the way to K18 with ease!
