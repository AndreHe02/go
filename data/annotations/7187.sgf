J:  Necessary is a bit much. Yes black 10 helps settle on the bottom and leaves white's stones on the right under attack. However since white's stones are weak I don't think it was necessary]

(;B[qm];W[ql];B[rl];W[rp];B[rq];W[pq];B[ro];W[rk];B[rm]C[J: you see how being defensive leaves you with a small territory walled in. The white group is not longer under much threat. AND white has sente to build on the outside.  Also black has to worry about the centre bottom group, which is not yet alive. White will profit from attacking this.]
;W[qf];B[qh]C[J: The pincer is too dangerous. Yuo give white something else to attack]
;W[of];B[oh]C[J: and as a result white gets to attack your top stone.]
;W[nd];B[oc];W[nc];B[rc];W[pi];B[ph];W[fc]C[J: Do you see how white is attacking, walling off your stones into small groups and then building on the outside stones.  This is white's strategy in handicap - separate black's stones.  White is already close to even and only 61 stones palyed so far :(]

At least I've not seen it as joseki before.]

(;B[hd]C[J; good, there is no need to worry about the atari.  98 could have been more expansive]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[jc]C[J; which is why you should have moved down the side when you had the chance :)]
;B[mh]C[J:  Yes thinking about making the group safe is correct]
;W[mk];B[lk]C[I thought i could live in the corner, so i reinforce my weak groups...                                                                                       J; Yes, i would reinforce too. Perhaps with k9 to give a little more shape.]

C[J;   It we sit back and look at the whole board what is the immediate situation?  black is worried about losing the corner and having a large group on the run.  Losing the corner is not so much a problem if the group can run safely. So is it worth fighting the ko?  it looks to me as if black can run into the centre and connect to the other weak group so black can consider ko threats that are of similar value to the corner.]

(;B[bb];W[lp]
(;B[km]C[J: It hurts to give up the 2 stones, all the bottom territory and let white secure the weak group. But the fight is not at all clear, probably not safe]

J: if you're simply guessing it will work it may be better to play elsewhere. Attempts that don't work make the position worse. and there is still the ko.]
;W[mn];B[nl];W[om];B[ml]C[J:  worst outcome of all white comes out of it all connected and with sente]

;W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ge];W[hd]C[J: I would like this - except black has many weak groups so white will attack them and build up a position from which to reduce the Black moyo.                                                                                           If the black groups were secure black's next move could be around K16 -  with the intention of attacking the marked white group.  since the 3 stones at Q12 are weak this is less likley to work.]

(;B[ol]C[J: i think its better to be more aggressive.  Its handicap and if you keep white with weak stones and attack them things should turn out well. Your corner is safe and after Q8 isn't going to be big so why so defensive?]
