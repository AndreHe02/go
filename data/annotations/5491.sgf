;B[eq]C[gop [2k\]: u2];W[do];B[eo]LB[ep:A]C[how should i respone this?

The hane you played seems ok, A, between de 2 black stones is also joseki, but can bring complicated fights.]
;W[en];B[dp]LB[fo:A][dn:B]C[This is not usual, A or B are normal continuation.]
;W[fo];B[ep];W[co];B[gp]LB[fn:A]C[Probably cuting at A is better for black, and the corner is still open.]

;B[dd];W[ee];B[bf];W[ch];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[pc]LB[pk:A]C[Maybe A is possible, threatening a cosmic moyo ^^]
;B[kc]LB[ic:1][mc:2]C[what respone is better 1 or 2

1 lets the black stone complettely isolated and thus weaker.
2 allows black to threaten a connection with the upper left corner, so black has more options and therefore it's stronger.

Also, attacking from the right pushes black to the left, where the bigger prospects for white are. So I choose 1]
;W[ic];B[nc];W[fb]C[This a yose move. a big one, but yose right now. It does not threaten to kill the corner, only a monkey jump. so it should be gote.
I think it's too early for this move. Black is not that much interested in playing here, even if for black would be sente, as it strengthens white in the outside.]
;B[eb];W[ne]C[Attacking from the left and building up a big moyo seems better.]

(;W[hd]C[Maybe too mild, see variation.];B[jd];W[mc]LB[mb:A]
[he:B][ng:C][og:D]C[This move is tempting, but I don't think that it's good.
The white stones are still in no immediate danger, and now white loses the possibility to play at the vital point of black's shape, A, that would left the black stones almost eyeless.
Probably, before such an attack, reinforcing at B would be necessary, to prevent black of trying to live inside white's zone of influence.
Capturing with C or reinforcing with D also seem possible.]

(;W[md]C[Bad choice, saving the other as in the variation seems better.]
;B[ob];W[oc];B[na];W[og]C[Looks big, but now that the 4 stones are connected is not as useful as before.]

[ir:B]C[If it's going to end like this the A-B exchange is better left off. Then B is a weak point of black's shape.]
;W[np];B[oo]LB[no:A]C[Maybe resisting with doble hane at A is possible for black. Sente is very important now.]
;W[no]LB[gn:A][bo:B][hf:C]C[Not big enough and of course not sente.
I would have problems deciding between A, B or something around C.]
;B[bn]
(;W[bo];B[ao]LB[cl:A]C[how should i block it

Maybe in this position A is best, you'll lose points in the side, but black will not make extra points. Probably you had to block before, now a lot of damage will be done.]
;W[bm]TR[fo]LB[cm:A][bl:B]C[A or B are the most usual answers, the one you chose is also possible sometimes, but when the sacrifice is of 2 stones, not 3, and the territory made is bigger and you get sente.
Here you end having to stop a monkey jump and black still can capture  later the marked stone. See variation before the push.]
;B[cn];W[cm];B[dn];W[dm];B[cp];W[bg]TR[fo]C[The side you keep is worth about 12 points, if black capture the marked stone has gained as much. You could as well protected the 3 stones and let black the side geting sente.]

I think so, but the fight can get complicated in either case.]
