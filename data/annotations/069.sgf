;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[pn]L[kp]C[ "a" is the only move ever  played
 in this situation.];W[pr]C[ this is too soon for white to scramble
 into the corner to make alive.];B[qq];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp];B[lp];W[lo];B[jq]
;W[mo];B[ip];W[io];B[hp]C[ is it better to cut here?];W[ho];B[fq]C[ Black is  doing well, and white is getting nothing.]
;W[dn]C[ up to this point, black is  coming out
 ahead.  white's potential on top should   be impossible to realize.  Meanwhile, black
 has a nice, solid group on the bottom and
 a secure side.];B[cq]C[ This is bad for black, good for white.
 White proceeds to do a good job of giving   black a weak group to defend.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]C[ Black has a  weak group in the corner, and
 simultaneously his territory on the bottom   is almost all erased.];B[bo]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[gq];B[hq];W[gp];B[mr]C[ was this  move unneccesary?
   Probably not, but you are wise to
 be worried.  A stronger opponent
 might make mincemeat of you later.
 The key point is that a stong opponent
 wouldn't attack immediately, as the
 rest of the board is still wide open.];W[jd]L[cj][bn]C[ Good time for white to  tenuki, but
 I think "a" would be a better move
 in the same style.  I also wonder about
 "b" first.];B[de];W[dh];B[cc];W[cb];B[dd]L[cd]C[ This should be at  "a"]
;W[ec];B[bd]L[cd][fe]C[ Black seems to be building himself
 another small live group.  That "small"
 shouldn't be the initial goal!
   If move 43 had been at "a" then 45 could be at   "b" and black would still have a fighting   chance.]
;W[bc]
(;B[fe]C[ Sorry, but you black can't ignore an  atari
 like this.]
(;W[gd];B[fh];W[fg]L[fi]C[ probably "a" would be better.  In any case,
 this move is too aggressive.];B[eg];W[eh];B[gg];W[fi];B[ff];W[gh];B[dg]
;W[hh];B[ch];W[ci];B[cm];W[dm];B[cl];W[bh]C[ up to this point, black  has done much
 better than he deserves, thanks to white's
 overly ambitious attack.];B[di]C[ Big mistake.];W[ei]C[ Inexplicably, white  declines the gift.
 Black could still salvage something by
 connecting.];B[dj];W[cg]L[fk]C[ at this point, I think black can still   prevent the white moyo by jumping in
 directly, maybe at "a".  ..but the black
 group in the top-left may die, which is
 too high a price to pay.];B[cf]C[ under the circumstances, the  right move.]
;W[cd];B[ge];W[hd];B[hf]L[be]C[ Black is getting a messy group
 that's barely alive, white is getting
 solid land on top.
   Black might have made his group alive
 without making such a big gift to white,
 by playing at "a" with obvious follow ups.];W[dk];B[ck]L[dl][kj]C
[ The two  stones are not important.
 Reducing the moyo is important.   "a" would be better, but I think
 a less direct attack would be best.
 Maybe something like "b"];W[dl];B[cj]C[ better to play n17 or  some such now i guess?
   Saving the two stones was definitely not the
 best move.  The corner is still up for grabs,
 and black will get a share whoever makes the
 first move.   The urgent move at this point
 is to prevent white's potential moyo from   being realized.];W[nc]L[nj]
[ej]C[ The same reasoning applies to white.    At this point, building the moyo is
 the high profit strategy.  It's almost
 there!   Given black's passive responses
 up to this point, someting like "a" might
 win everything.      White did well to avoid sealing with "b",
 since black's potential inroad is fairly   small. (BTW, on first viewing, I thought
 "b" was a good idea - so remember, I'm
 not that much stronger than you that you
 can always trust my judgements!)];B[kj]C[ Yes, better late  than never.]
;W[qf];B[nd]C[ Black's direction is wrong; friends are   towards the bottom.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pe];W[ri]C[ what is the best way  for black to deal with this?]
;B[rj]C[ This is about the best available.  At  least
 it limits the damage and recovers sente.];W[qi];B[qj];W[og]C[   riverrun 15k*: is entering byo-yomi]
;B[pc]L[qe][ph]C[   xx 14k*: is entering byo-yomi
   B91 isn't making territory, or even alive,
 because of W80.
   I think "a" is better, because it puts pressure
 on the weak white group.  After some exchange in response
 to "a" there is still another attack at "b", and
 only after that would black play here.];W[ni];B[nk];W[rd];B[ng];W[of];B
[me];W[ld];B[mg];W[kf]L[li]C[ Something like "a" might
 be better.  Black will still
 get away, but white will have
 more potential for his moyo-building
 effort.];B[mi];W[nh];B[mh];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob]C[ connecting is  small, only worth
 a few points.];B[pi]L[qc]C[ at this point, "a" is really big for white;
 if he gets "a" then his group is completely
 secure, whereas without it he's still fighting
 for eye space.
   So black should do something about it first.];W[ph];B[qh];W[rh];B[pg]
;W[qg]C[ Black's attack has made white strong.];B[oi]C[ threatening the  two stones is not
 important, and that is all that   black is threatening at this point.]
;W[oh]C[ by the same token, defending the
 two stones isn't important either.
   with the white group secure, the big territory
 still in doubt is the moyo.  Get to it!  This
 kind of error is where weaker players get taken
 to the cleaners by marginally stronger players;
 the local tactics are sound, but the big move
 is elsewhere.];B[fg]C[ black saves 1 point.  big deal.];W[bf]C[ white  threatens a 1 point gain.
 big deal.];B[mj]C[ unnecessary.];W[ce];B[df];W[jn];B[rc]C[ in retrospect, an  obviously useless move.  what is the best point to   reduse white center moyo?
   At this point, the groups are all safe,   so black's move is a straight territory
 play, worth only 10 points or so, and gote
 at that.  Earlier it was a much bigger move.
   The moyo has been begging for attention
 from either player since about move 100.
 The obvious building and reducing moves,
 the ones you (plural) eventually used,
 are good ones.];W[om];B[pm];W[ol]C[ White is just forcing black to make
 his territory secure.  It's only important
 to play moves like this if black could make
 a disproportionate gain if he took the initiative.
 In this case, he can't.];B[pf];W[re];B[sf]C[ Nice try, but white will live  easily.]
;W[sg];B[on];W[mm];B[ok];W[sj]C[ This is a rather small play for  white,
 better saved as a ko threat.
   Black can't ignore it, of course.];B[sk];W[si];B[rk];W[qr]C[ This is another  small play for white, which black
 should ignore.  Instead black should reduce the   white moyo looming in the center.]
;B[rr];W[pq]C[   riverrun 15k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[qp]C[   xx 14k*: has entered byo-yomi again]
;W[jk]C[ Finally, white finally notices he has a potential
 to build a moyo worth 40 points, instead of chipping
 a point or two at a time.];B[ej];W[fj]M[fi][dh][eh][ei]L[fk]C[ Since the stones "x" are not in  danger,
 white could make a basket at "a" and   reduce black's invasion.];B[ek]
;W[fl];B[fk];W[gk];B[el];W[fm];B[em];W[en];B[bi];W[ch];B[jj];W[ik];B[kk]

 riverrun 15k*: thanks];B[pl];W[ml]C[   riverrun 15k*: yep.:)];B[nr];W[oq]

;B[sr];W[cp];B[bp];W[cn];B[bn];W[ds]C[   Generally speaking, black is too concerned with making
 live groups, and so is making heavy, over concentrated
 groups.  In some sense you have to take it on faith that
 there will be eyes, as long as you still have plenty   of running room.
   You both are playing reasonable tactics most of the
 time (with occasional lapses) with the biggest problem
 is seeing the big picture, making the globally big move
 rather than a tactically correct but much smaller move.
   Consider that several times you eventually made the
 "right" move, but only after some preliminary dithering
 elsewhere.  It's largely a matter of luck which player
 noticed the bigger move first.])
(;W[cd];B[ce];W[cc];B[be]C[ white 40 makes  this black wall worthless.
 Black has no eyes and is running, makeing
 white strong wherever he goes.]))
(;B[cd];W[bb];B[bh];W[fe];B[fh]C[ This  would still be a tough fight
 for black, but the corner group should
 survive, and black is in a good position
 to run with "51" in such a way that white
 won't get a moyo.]))
