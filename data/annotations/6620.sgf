C[Hello, my name is Kim.  I'll be reviewing this game for Andrew Shen (white).  Sometimes I also make suggestions for black to show what another player might have done to exploit certain things.  Enjoy the review!]

;B[bd];W[bc];B[de];W[ee]C[This move is a bit of an overplay, as black attempts to show.]

;B[kb];W[hb];B[hc];W[ib]TR[kd][ie][hf]C[White has too many cutting points to attempt to kill the black group.  Almost any combination of plays on the marked points will set up a double atari or a ladder from which white can not escape.  (See the variation for one example)]

;B[ie];W[if];B[je];W[kd];B[me]TR[ke]C[This is the beginning of a mistake by black.  If he had played L15, threatening to capture the 5 white stones, he could have easily escaped.]
;W[ke];B[jf];W[kf];B[jg];W[kg]
(;B[ig]LB[hf:B][ig:A]C[Black still has a good chance here if he captures rather than playing that atari.  (See variation.)]
;W[hf]
(;B[eg]LB[ja:1][ka:2][la:3][ob:B][eg:A]C[This is black's very last chance.  He cannot afford this move right now.  He only has 3 liberties, but if he can get one of the white groups down to two liberties, he will be fine.  (See variation.)]
;W[la];B[ma];W[na];B[ob];W[ka];B[oa];W[ja]C[After white makes this capture, the game should be his.  The capture itself gives almost 30 points and black's outside influence is weak.  When I saw this, I wondered how this game was going to be close enough to justify a review.]
;B[hg];W[le]LB[pj:C][po:A][jp:B]C[This move is not worth very much.  White and black are both safe in this area and white has poked out into the center.  So, this move doesn't really do anything right now.

The board is still wide open in a lot of places.  The bottom and right sides are big right now and black's bottom right corner could be approached.  Moves at A, B, or C would all be much bigger than playing here.]
;B[ld];W[qo]C[Approaching the corner, good!];B[qm];W[rq]LB[oo:A]
[op:B]C[Taking the corner isn't a very good plan here, especially if you're going to let yourself get entirely enclosed as you do.

A better plan would be to jump out with A or B.];B[qp];W[rp]
;B[po];W[qq];B[pp];W[rn];B[qn];W[ro];B[rm]C[This result already looks rather bad for white.  Black has a lot of strong outside influence.

White can tenuki here and should probably do so.  Making the corner bigger only helps black to make the outside stronger.]

;W[dq];B[er];W[hs];B[gs];W[fs];B[es];W[ir];B[cr];W[dr]C[If white's goal here is to kill the black stones, he cannot succeed.  Black's stones have a little too much strength for that to work.]
;B[ds];W[go];B[fo];W[fn]C[White is just asking for trouble here.  He is leaving cutting points and giving the black stones excuses to get stronger.]
;B[en];W[eo];B[do];W[dn];B[ep];W[em];B[cp];W[eo];B[cq]
(;W[hn]LB[gn:B][hn:A]C[It would be slightly better to make a solid connection here.  (See variation.)]
;B[en];W[co]C[This is another small move.  At this point, black is very much alive in the corner, so white only threatens to take away a couple points with this move.]
;B[bo];W[cn];B[fm];W[gn];B[el];W[eo];B[lb];W[ma];B[en];W[jh]
C[The ko is pretty big, so it doesn't make a lot of sense to just abandon it right now.]
;B[ih];W[eo];B[kh];W[dp]
(;B[dq]C[Black doesn't really need this move.  Capturing K12 instead would have been pretty big.  (See variation.)]
;W[ji];B[do];W[ii];B[gg];W[fg]C[Pushing through here is a pretty good idea for white.  It works well.]
;B[gh];W[fh];B[gi];W[fl];B[en];W[gm];B[fi];W[eh];B[dh];W[ei]
;B[dl];W[dm];B[ej];W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[hk];W[il]C[White has played a nice sequence up until this point.  He should be able to contain and kill the large black group.]
;B[ik];W[jk];B[jj];W[kj];B[ki];W[ij];B[hl];W[im]LB[jl:B][im:A]
C[In a situation like this, playing a solid move at K8 would be slightly better.  Either move kills black, but K8 does it with less weakness, and since white ends up failing to take care of that weakness later, it would have been very useful in this game.]
;B[lj];W[li];B[lh];W[mi];B[mh];W[mj]C[Playing here and giving black an excuse to extend in response is problematic.  Be careful about what strength you give your opponent excuses to build when attacking.]
;B[lk];W[nh];B[mg];W[ng];B[mf];W[md]C[White cannot afford to play this move right now, as black soon shows...]
;B[kk];W[jj]LB[jj:A][jl:B]C[White cannot connect here.  Doing so leaves him with only 2 liberties once black plays K8.  Since there is no way to keep the black stones on the outside at two liberties, it doesn't work.

So, white must play K8 and prepare to fight the ko.  Fighting the ko is painful when the black stones in the middle should have been dead, but it's really the only choice.]

;B[ek];W[cl];B[gl];W[fm];B[di];W[dk];B[ip];W[jp];B[hq];W[hr]
C[This move does not accomplish anything.  Notice that if black played it, he would be in atari.  So, white has nothing to worry about until black plays H4.  Playing little unnecessary moves like this really adds up to cost a lot of points over the course of the game.]

(;W[ld]LB[ld:A][lf:C][lg:B]C[White does not have time to fill if he wants to win this ko by capturing black.  He should play M13 or M14.  (See variation.)]
;B[hi];W[mq];B[nq];W[mr];B[nr];W[oo]LB[ph:B][oo:A]C[Rather than pushing here, white would be better off trying to live first.  If he can carve out some big territory on the side, he should still be able to win this game.  Something around Q12 looks like it might work well.]

[ap][dp][aq][bq][oq][ar][br][dr][as][bs][cs]C[The two main things that stand out in this game are the careless loss of groups and the number of small moves.

So, in future games, be more careful about your groups.  Once you kill some stones, don't get overconfident and start thinking that every group on the board will fall to you if you attack it.  Instead, take care of your own groups.  Double check the safety of your groups, and play to protect them if need be.  A little more care will prevent big points swings.

Also watch out for the small handfuls of points that you lose without realizing it.  Before you play a move ask yourself whether or not it threatens to do anything significant.  If it does not do much, there is a good chance that it will be ignored.  If you make enough little moves that are ignored, you will gradually fall behind over the course of the game.

With just a little more care when playing your moves, you could do much better in games like this.  Keep up the good work.
