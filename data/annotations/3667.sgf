C[This is a game between Juhazi 7k and go3d 8k.

I have placed questions and moves I considered throughout the sgf as to show the way I think about go.

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]

(;W[df]LB[de:B][dg:A]C[Hi - I am crazyd, the reviewer.  Janice Kim (pro 1P) says amateurs should not play taisha.  Maybe pick simple joseki.  White can choose to build left side or destroy upper side.]
;B[ed];W[dd];B[de];W[dc];B[ce];W[ee];B[ef];W[fd];B[dg];W[nc]
;B[qf];W[ne]C[crazyd - Good idea, or how about 16 W F13, B E13, W O17, B R14, W Q18, B R17, W L17 or M16?]
;B[pj];W[nq];B[jp];W[qn];B[oo];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]
;B[oq];W[qp];B[om]C[This result seems equal, am I correct?

crazyd - looks good for white]
(;W[fq]LB[dj:B][ck:C][hq:A]C[I think this move was the best one available.

I considered A for limiting black, the problem is the F3 gap between A and corner.

B for moyo but I did not think I could get a moyo here thanks to K4.

C for reducing the value of blacks thickness in the upper left and preparing for a move at D6.]
;B[hq]C[Ha! I think this move is slow from black, this was my chance, I think.]

(;W[cn]LB[ck:A]C[crazyd - Usually not good to have two low extensions from 4-4.]
;B[cj];W[pb];B[qc];W[qh]C[crazyd - Yes.  You are envious of his 3-space extension on right?  If you can invade that, B can invade 7-space extension at top!]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[oh]C[Here my resolution falters and I start to think whether this will work at all.]
;W[qj]C[crazyd - Locally, S14 or P11 alternatives to R10.  Upper side is big area.]
;B[qk]
(;W[oi]C[And a decision to sacrifice the original stones.

Perhaps I just should have lived in gote and start thinking about how to respond to blacks apparent next move in the top side.]
;B[pi];W[pk]C[crazyd - Why create weak groups?  46 looks like B gets two turns - W hanes at 46, B cuts at 43 and gets another turn!]
;B[qi];W[oj];B[rj];W[ri];B[qj];W[ql];B[rh];W[pl];B[nh]C[crazyd - B makes many slow moves and you rely on them, but to get strong and play stronger opponents on equal basis you should anticipate best moves by opponent.]
;W[mg];B[gf]C[crazyd - B J17 instead would hurt, wouldn't it?]
;W[he];B[jd]C[So, the next invasion...

Would it have been better to chase black towards the center instead of shutting him in?

crazyd - Yes - take territory because it is too easy for B to live inside an enclosure.  Outside wall not so valuable here.]

;B[si];W[nk];B[gr]C[I faltered here too. I think I should have played B9 or something similar now.]
;W[gq]C[But I decide to answer.

crazyd - Isn't F2 better direction?  B F2 next decreases your corner in sente]
;B[hr];W[fr];B[mo]C[and black destroys the O3 aji almost completely.]

crazyd - confusing game.  Maybe some bizarre moves were to make time controls?  If any of my comments seem confusing to you, just email your questions to me.]
