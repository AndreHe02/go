C[Hi, thanks for reviewing this game!

I'd be glad to hear all sort of comments in addition to answers to my questions, if you see a move that breaks some common rule, or is out of place or so, I'd be glad to be corrected.

-Svante-: Hello, I am your reviewer.];B[pp];W[qd];B[dd];W[dp]
;B[od]C[Since black has a stone in the upper left corner, I decided not to pincer.]
;W[oc];B[nc];W[pc];B[md]LB[ne:B][qf:A]
(;W[qf];B[ic];W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[qq]
(;W[lp]LB[qk:B][cn:A]C[I played the high move, because I already had star stone in the bottom left.

-Svante-: I would prefer L3 here; I shall try to explain.  Usually, you would try to keep a high-low balance.  This shape now wants to have another move at J3 or H3, since it is open to an attack at K3.  Even if White gets F3, e.g. as an answer to a black approach at C6, the distance is quite wide, so a black move at K3 would not feel too much pressure.  Additionally, the opening so far is rather territory-oriented, and I feel that it is prudent to keep the territorial balance.  Finally, having a finished shape lets you put your attention elsewhere.]
(;B[cn]LB[dn:B][fp:A]
(;W[fp]C[-Svante-:  This begs for another move at J3, which feels a little cramped.  I would rather play this low.  One could also think about playing the old-fashioned G3 here to make the gap on the lower side closer, but that also leaves the corner more open.  The difficulty at this decision is caused by M4.]
;B[dj]
(;W[ql]C[It felt like he should've protected this group once, so I decided to go for the attack.

-Svante-:  As written before, this protection was not necessary.  Black can simply answer with R2, which not only stabilizes his group, but also destabilizes the white O3 group and is a very big endgame move.
The right side is not the focus of the game now.  The interesting parts of the board are Black's framework in the upper left and White's gap on the lower side.]
(;B[qi]C[This is odd, I was expecting him to reinforce his corner group, instead he invaded getting two groups in trouble at once.

-Svante-:  The lower black group is not yet really in trouble, since, should White play R2, Black can get out with P6 in good shape.  However, I also think that Black should simply have played R2, making miai of R11 and K3.]
;W[ol];B[oi];W[qr]C[I didn't know how to attack this group, so I decided to slide.

-Svante-:  If Black plays R2, there is little White can do to this group, so this is the only way to attack.]
(;B[rr]C[-Svante-:  Black should go out immediately, because he can do little against S4 now.]
;W[rp]
(;B[rq]C[-Svante-:  Because of M4, Black now does not have the standard tesuji at S5.]
;W[qo];B[po];W[rn]
(;B[qm]C[-Svante-: Bad shape by Black, reducing his own liberties.]
;W[rm]C[I couldn't think of another sequence here.]
(;B[on]LB[mm:A][nm:B]C[The questions start here, how should I have kept attacking black? My S6 group seems safe, my O3 group seems safe, so I wanted to keep pressuring Q5 as much as possible, since he didn't protect it in time.

-Svante-:  The S6 group has one eye so far.  S9 would secure the group, but in gote, while Black can peep here in sente.  This group is definitely weaker than the M4 group, so White should play from this side.
Regarding the black move, Black should really try not to get enclosed; it would have been better to play N5 to get out.]
(;W[mm]C[-Svante-:  I believe that it is best to use the Q10 peep as shown in the second variation.]
;B[om];W[pm]C[This move might seem overplay, but I wanted to keep him struggling for both eyes.

-Svante-:  Letting him get Q7 in sente surely seems too easy.]
;B[pn];W[pl]
(;B[mn]C[-Svante-:  Black could now first play S9, so that the white group has only one eye.  The cuts in the centre would then be more worrisome for White.]
(;W[ln];B[nm];W[nl];B[mo];W[lo];B[oq];W[or];B[np]
(;W[pq]LB[op:A][qp:B]C[-Svante-:  White does need a sente move here, in order to protect the centre.  If White simply connects at N3, Black is already alive.  However, White can also play N4, which seems to connect in sente.]
(;B[op]C[This move surprised me, I easily got a hold of the corner.]
;W[qp];B[mq];W[nr];B[mr]LB[no:A][mp:B]C[This move also surprised me, I was expecting him to play O5 or such.

Now I make a big blunder.

-Svante-:  This move is certainly wrong, since White can play N4 in sente, then capture it.]
(;W[no]C[I decided I might be able to get the black group killed.

-Svante-:  I have the impression that little thinking went into this decision.  If you play a nakade, you should have read out that it works, otherwise, it becomes a lost move.]
;B[mp];W[rs]C[-Svante-:  Since White has to defend here, it is obvious that O5 is a lost move.  It is almost as if you had passed!]
;B[jq]C[-Svante-:  Black has no problems; O5 is lost.];W[hq]
;B[jj]C[I misread this part.

-Svante-:  This looks like a handicap game now.  However, I think that Black should defend the lower group directly.]
;W[kr];B[kq]LB[lq:B][jr:A]
(;W[jr]C[So I had to play here first.];B[lq]
(;W[ll]C[If I don't protect I get my three stones captured in a cranes nest-tesuji, so I don't really have a choice.

-Svante-:  Since O8 is strong, you can defend against that tesuji in a more enclosing way (see variation).]
;B[jn];W[jo];B[io];W[jp];B[iq]LB[ip:A][ir:B]C[At this point I decided to give up trying to kill the bottom group.

-Svante-:  I am sorry for pointing this out, but it should be remarked that this decision comes 16 moves too late.]
(;W[ip];B[ir]LB[cc:A][hr:B]
(;W[cc]C[When black has two side extensions, I've been taught that it's best to invade the 3-3 point.

-Svante-:  It is not a bad idea per se, but this also simplifies the game.  Do you think that White has enough points after this?]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[db];B[eb];W[cb]
;B[fc]LB[lc:A][cl:B]C[How to invade the black moyo? I completely failed here.

From this moment, I honestly thought I was leading by a lot. I had four corners, and the center didn't look that big.

-Svante-:  I honestly think that White is trailing.  The corners are not very big, and the lower left corner is yet undecided.  In the top right, about 15 points, lower right, 18 points, upper left, 8 points, lower side, perhaps 10, so White has about 50.  Black has 12 on the lower side, 10 around the last move; if we claim that the areas around A and B are not yet secure, we count them as half (5 each), and the centre moyo of about 45 points, halved to 22; overall 54 points (which I believe to be a bit pessimistic from Black's side---it is difficult to reduce or invade three points at once).

How did you think that you attained a lead?  Did you think that the lower right was a huge success for you?  All the points Black lost in the corner he regained on the lower side, and while White certainly got quite thick on the outside, this is mostly moderated by Black's K10 and P11.]
(;W[lc]LB[mb:B][nb:A]C[This invasion failed, since I didn't have enough backup, and black had too many stones around.]
(;B[nb];W[ke];B[nf];W[kg];B[jf];W[nh]C[I aimed at cutting the two white stones for extra profit.]
;B[pg];W[of];B[ng];W[og];B[oh];W[pf]C[The ladder works for me, so I could connect here.]
(;B[mj];W[mh];B[kf];W[ne];B[lg]LB[me:B][lf:A]
(;W[lf]C[I made a blunder, thinking this move was tesuji.

N16 spoils everything.];B[mf];W[lj];B[lh];W[nj];B[li];W[ni]
C[I felt happy to capture the four stones.

I really thought I was leading by a huge amount by now.

-Svante-:  Well, the 10 + 5 + 22 points of Black have now turned into 10 + 10 + 50 (a gain of about 30), while you have gained 30 on the right.  Additionally, Black gained sente, and the game is more settled now.]
;B[lk];W[hr];B[hs];W[gs];B[is];W[gq];B[bp]C[-Svante-:  Black could also invade on C3, but this way is more safe, and Black has enough.]
;W[cq];B[en];W[bh];B[bg];W[ag];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj]C[At this point I realized my lack of liberties, and felt annoyed to give up sente.

-Svante-:  B3 is bigger than saving two stones here, but White doesn't have enough points anyway.]
;W[bd];B[bq];W[br];B[gn]C[-Svante-:  I think that one can safely say that the game is over here.]
;W[bo];B[co];W[cp];B[bn];W[aq]C[I thought this was nice endgame sequence.]

;B[hk];W[ho]C[I misread this part, or rather, read it correctly after playing this move.]
;B[jm];W[in];B[kl];W[ob]
(;B[me];W[na]C[I thought it was odd of him to let me have this sente move by playing N15 gote.

At least it doesn't seem that large.

-Svante-:  N15 certainly is the safest way to play (see variation to last move).  Why should Black risk anything while 30 points ahead?]
;B[ma];W[oa];B[mb];W[ms];B[ls];W[ns];B[ch];W[ah];B[oj]C[-Svante-:  Black doesn't need this at all.]
;W[ok]C[I was confident I could kill this group.];B[qg]LB[rh:A]

(;W[rh]C[It's a shame I misread this move for the killing move.

-Svante-:  Actually, this also works.];B[rg];W[ri];B[rj]
(;W[qj]C[-Svante-:  White can play the clamp instead.];B[rk]
C[-Svante-:  A simple liberty count shows that White has only 3 to Black's 4.  Verification that R12 also doesn't work is left as an exercise for the reader.]
;W[qk];B[qh];W[rl]C[At this point (once again) I realized I had missed my lack of liberties.]
;B[si]C[This felt like a big blow, but I felt I was still doing good.

I should've resigned but I didn't know it by then.

-Svante-:  This is a swing of about 40-45 points.];W[rf];B[sh]
;W[sf];B[oe];W[pj];B[pi];W[sk]C[I thought this was sente, but it wasn't.

I saw some sort of magical throw-in tesuji at S11, which didn't exist.]

I solve all sorts problems from opening to endgame, life&death and tesuji daily, a few hours, and still my results are such.

I have played for three years, solved problems daily for three years, still I feel like one of those players who never improve.

I hope you can give me some tips on what to concentrate
on in the future.

Thanks for reviewing my game.

-Svante-:  The first problem in this game was that you missed the balance on the lower side (you might find the series "on your side" by Charles Matthews, available from gobase.org, interesting).  Then you misjudged the strength of the lower right black group.  Then you played a nakade without realizing that you could not kill.  Finally, you completely misjudged the score (perhaps the counting lessons by Steve Fawthrop, available on Sensei's Library, are something for you) and the remaining possibilites for invasion or reduction.  After the game was over, you lost even more points because you did not read properly (you say that you are doing problems---I recommend to mostly solve lots and lots of easy problems).]
