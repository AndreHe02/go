C[Hello.

I'm white in this KGS game against a 3k (no handi, 6.5 komi, 30 min each, byoyomi = 5 period of 30s). I won by 6.5 pts.

I don't feel I did any major mistake, even if my yose does not look good. But maybe I'm wrong. Could you give me your feedback about what was not so good and what I could improve. The game was not very aggressive actually. I also put some comments in the game itself.

Thanks for the review.

MR: Comments will start with "MR:"
The game is going rather smoothly with no big blunders on both sides.
Therefore, I just made comments on some of the moves - mainly on white's part (as desired), but also sometimes on black's. 

Main points are maybe:
1) Step back every now and then to decide on the strategic goal (you do that sometimes, but sometimes really important points are missed).
2) Don't allow your opponent to take all major endgame moves.]

(;W[nq]C[In this position, I prefer to tenuki since I don't know whether R17 (more usual) or L17 would be better. Is it correct?

MR: It is fine to tenuki here. However, the reason is different. You might want to decide later whether you want to play R17 or R12 (see variation). In case that black comes to play in the corner with R17 first, the correct white answer is L17.]
;B[oq]C[MR: This is double kyu player mistake ...];W[np]
(;B[or]
(;W[nr]C[For me, P2 is not very usual, but I don't know what is the best answer. Here perhaps I played a bit submissively.

MR: P2 is "unusual", but O2 is worse. You need to play an extension!]
(;B[qm]C[Again an unusual move. Maybe it is correct after P2?

MR: No, I would definitely punish O2 by pincering around J3. Of course, white can play Q5 etc., but this is nothing against having an extension along the bottom edge. Locally on the right side, the correct shape for black is Q6.]
;W[jq]C[I hesitated between this move and J3. I prefered to not take any risk since black is strong at right.

MR: You can use a rule of thumb. You know that K3 is correct extension if there are *two* white stones (O3, O4). So now that there is one white stone more in the O row, you should extend one line further to J3.]
;B[hq];W[cn]C[Since I played strongly at bottom, I can tenuki after H3, can't I?

MR: Sure you can ...];B[fp];W[bp];B[lq]C[MR: I would not want to play here directly, but at least exchange black C3 for white C9 first in order to settle the bottom left black group ...]
;W[kp]C[does not seem to work for black even if it let aji.]
;B[qi]C[black looks overconcentrated here, doesn't it?

MR: If black wants to play on the right side, R17 is the correct move. However, I agree that this is not really "topic". First black should settle his lower group, then he should play F17 or similar to establish a group in the upper left quarter.]
(;W[eq]C[This move seems to be played often by strong player. So I tried it. But I don't know how to handle it actually.

MR: You should first make up your mind what you want. Here, you have the side problem that the C6 group is not yet settled and black will be able to play forcing moves against it. Further, do you really need to kill the black group? If not, I would tend to "enemy's key point is your own". C3 settles your group and robs the base from the black group.]
;B[dq]C[MR: This answer must have been forseeable for you ... C9 is maybe most honest, but then, of course, the exchange E3 for D3 is good for black.]
(;W[fq];B[co]C[I did not think about this good move...];W[bo]
;B[gq];W[do]C[My 2 stones look dead. I tried to use their aji as most as possible.]
;B[ep];W[cr];B[dr];W[ci]C[Is it the right extension? The game looks close.

I lost my E3 stone, but my attack was not so bad since black is small, the corner is destroyed and I got a good extension. I could probably do better but I don't know how.

MR: see comments on E3 move];B[ld]
(;W[qc]C[Is this move ok? I choose it because I would to make my group stable before anything else.

MR: It is reasonable, Alternatively, one could think about some move to run out, like Q14.]
;B[rc]
(;W[rb]C[MR: This is gote. Now it would have been time to reattack or to run out.]
;B[sb];W[qb];B[ne]C[MR: Black tries to close the large hole with one move ... but this does not work, as Q14 is still possible for white.]
;W[pf]C[I would to disconnect the black stones and to be unenclosed.

MR: Good.];B[qe];W[jc]C[... But I changed my plan. I'm still able to connect my top-right group to the center or to the left and I try to build a white framework at the top-left.

But maybe it is wrong to change my plan so fast?

MR: It is seldomly a good idea to change plans so often ... You should have connected, especially, as cutting of Q14 is large if black manages to get a move around O7.]
;B[mc];W[nd];B[me]
(;W[fc]C[Black form looks bad. Maybe I should N16 instead of this move. But it is big.

MR: No, you should not play N16, but poke your head out at P14. This keeps the black groups separated and destroys any hope for a black moyo.
(It is often a good idea to leave other person's bad shapes alone ... he or she will have trouble with it anyway and will have to look for the aji so that he or she cannot play that aggressive ...)]
(;B[cf]C[MR: Off topic, in my opinion this should be at Q15.]

(;W[dj];B[cj]C[I read this a little before playing D10 and it seems good for me...

MR: Maybe it is a matter of taste ... white C10 (instead of D10) does not leave direct cutting point and black still has a very weak shape ...]

;B[gh];W[fi]C[This move was bad.];B[gg];W[pe]C[This move looks now very important in order to be sure that black has two weak groups. Furthermore, it weakens a little bit the right black part.

MR: ... and it is strange enough that you finally got to play it after so many moves ...]
;B[ig]C[MR: White needs to take some advantage of a splitting attack at the top, as the only remaining main territory is the black one on the right edge.]

(;W[bq];B[fm];W[el]C[Don't know how to answer to F7. Maybe best to tenuki since there is no more point here?

MR: I would tenuki and play all the sente endgame moves that are on the board ... e.g. T11, P1 etc.

I will stop the comment here since the remaining part of the game is endgame, with lots of small mistakes on both sides. Black gets many endgame moves that were white's privelegue (like S12, O1), however, white still manages to secure a small win.]
