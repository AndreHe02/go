C[Enjoy the review.  A piece of advice, don't over analyze your positions because you'll throw yourself into unnecesary confusion.  I'm a tad blunt in my reviews so just a heads up.
I'll review for your moves but if White does anything that proves my point I'll also include that.

Main points of the review:

Overall I think you're quite thoughtful and know much about the basics of go.  However I think you have a bit of a problem with seeing the grand scheme of things and really being able to zoom out into the whole board mentality.  Also the sequences towards the end got to be extremely complicated and I did my best to offer suggestions.  You have to practice being able to precisely determine groups and how they are connected.  I know it's hard when they are large groups but you can do it with practice.  Plus, don't feel bad when your opponent invades and runs out, learn to make use of their invasion to gain yourself points.  Moyos are meant to be invaded.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp]LB[ec:B][eq:A]
(;B[eq]LB[hp:A][hq:B]C[Nothing wrong with this.  White can consider many things at this point including the two pincers at A and B]
;W[dq]C[This is not a good move, it does not make any use of the q 4 stone and loses any possible moyo potential.]
;B[ep];W[cm]LB[cn:A]C[Kind of far, normally at A.];B[iq]C[Fine.]
;W[kq]CR[gq]C[This move is slack because the invasion at g3 isn't really that severe because c7 is too far away (I'll discuss that later).  Let's say black tenuki's and makes a shimari.]

(;B[kp]TR[kq]C[First off I'll begin by saying this move greatly helps White.]

(;W[lq];B[lp]LB[jn:B][jp:A]C[Nothing wrong here, if white wants to just let you push him down then go for it.]
;W[mp]
(;B[jp]LB[jo:B][jq:A][mq:C]TR[kq][lq]C[Russ: Move at A better? Reduces liberties of marked group and ladder at B works. Makes the cut at C a threat.]
;W[gp]C[Yes there are bigger points but it seems white is really enamored with trying to invade and starting a fight and i'm not sure why.]

(;B[gq]C[This is not bad at all, it makes perfect sense.];W[hq]

(;B[hp];W[hr]LB[gr:A][ir:A]C[Russ: A could have caught the 2 stones but then White could have separated Black into 2 groups. See variation.]

LB[go:B][gp:A]C[Well first off if white tried to run out with A outright that'd just great a weak group that you could easily attack.  I think just capturing is incredibly small.  Let's say white tried.]

(;B[ld]TR[gp]C[Yes the threat is aji but a low pincer would've made a ton more sense here.]

Yes it is but he can always sacrifice these stones.]
(;B[ib]LB[jb:A]C[Russ: Wanted to split White. Maybe A instead?]
;W[hb]C[Since white is in an area of black influence he's going to try and make sabaki.  You cannot leave openings for him to do so.]
;B[jb]LB[ic:A]C[Russ: A would've been better I think.]
(;W[ob]C[This is aji keshi and a very bad move.];B[pb];W[nb]

(;B[qh]LB[ph:A]TR[hb][hc]C[Russ: Not sure what the best play is now. Maybe attack marked group? Maybe at A to put more pressure on White?]

(;B[fh]C[This is not aggressive enough, he's in your area of influence.]

;W[ei];B[fj];W[ej];B[fk]
(;W[ek]TR[bj][cj][bk][ck]C[Keep going for the center because the marked area is open so white can't make territory there.]

(;B[jf];W[em]C[This is big.  If your bottom group destabilizes whites group will gain life and much in the way of points.  Your bottom groups are not going to be able to maintain their connections.  Some of the seperate lines of play are me just playing out different lines of possibilities (this is really complex)]
