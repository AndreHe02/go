C[[EV\] Hello, this is your reviewer Eric Vella.  My comments will be marked this way.  This was a good game for both sides, with few serious mistakes until the complicated fighting.]

(;W[oj]C[[EV\] W normally either settles the corner directly or presses harder -- see variations.  The game move is good for developing center strength, but given the strong B position below, that may be difficult to use effectively.]

(;B[qj]C[[EV\] This protects the R8 cut but seems too small and conservative -- see previous variation.]

(;W[dg]CR[dj]C[bad move?
is F15 better?

[EV\] F15 is probably the most common continuation (you supplied one variation), but this move looks reasonable in this game, with the marked stone already in place.]
;B[bp];W[hb]C[[EV\] Hard to say whether starting a fight here is good or not.  W should be able to establish a nice position on top with this attack, but forcing B to run through the W center is not appealing to me.

W could also simply play first in the empty corner and await developments.  That way W preserves two threats -- this move (if W builds up a bit more strength to the right), or F15 (if that would make B over-concentrated to the right).]

(;W[ge];B[fe];W[di];B[hh];W[ld]LB[pg:C][en:A][mn:B]C[[EV\] Let's pause to evaluate the result of the W attack starting with H18.  W built a moderate position at the top and solidified the upper left.  B ran out through the W center, pretty much eliminating any W moyo prospects there.  Seems like a fairly even game still.  

[EV\] B has sente and could now get the first move in the upper right corner.  Other good choices are A (expanding the bottom and preparing C8) or B (expanding the bottom, making W look thin on the right, preparing a cut or further expansion at O8) or C (approaching the corner and again making W look thin on the right).  These moves all also indirectly help the H12 group.]
;B[ie]C[[EV\] B possibly thought this and the following were light forcing moves?]
;W[he];B[id];W[if]CR[pi][oj]C[[EV\] Very good -- W fights back strongly here.  W should do better when both sides get cut, since he has more surrounding strength.  The marked stones in particular are looking forward eagerly to this fight :)]
;B[ke];W[jc];B[kd];W[kc];B[hd];W[gd];B[gc]
(;W[ih]C[[EV\] I like K13 better, attacking both sides equally, avoiding contact.  But it requires some reading to make sure W cannot be captured.]
;B[jg];W[ig];B[hi];W[ii];B[lf];W[hk]C[bad
P17 better?

[EV\] Yes, I think W should defend the top group.  The point of an attack is usually to make territory while attacking, not to kill, so W should take the opportunity to do so.  N17 or N16 might be the best defense, giving B no forcing moves to help settle his running group.  N15 would also be good, defending the cut and attacking at the same time.]
;B[nd]C[[EV\] Good, this looks like the best fighting chance for B.]
;W[mc];B[nc];W[me]
(;B[nf]C[[EV\] B decides to give up the cutting stones?  B gets a fair amount of corner territory in compensation, but continuing the fight seems more consistent.]
;W[ne];B[oe];W[mf];B[mg];W[le]C[[EV\] W avoids a trap.  Any of the possible cuts would result in a nasty surprise.]
;B[ng];W[kf];B[lg];W[kh];B[kg];W[jf];B[qc]C[i think i let B plays too easy

[EV\] W did fine here, capturing the cutting stones.  R17 leaves too many cutting points, so the B corner is not yet secure, but I do not see any other moves which do much better.]
;W[cb]C[[EV\] If W really wants to kill, F19 is the best start, allowing B to make one eye in gote, rather than one eye in sente.  This move is OK for making territory while attacking less strongly.]
;B[fa];W[da]C[[EV\] B can easily make a second eye in the center, so this move is premature.  A center move forcing B to live here is worth more.  Or W could switch to the bottom, leaving the center aji for B to worry about.]
;B[fj];W[fk];B[hj];W[gq]C[[EV\] Reducing the bottom now is important.  This move looks like a good start.]
;B[fp];W[fr];B[er];W[jq];B[ij]C[[EV\] Too small.  Even if a W move here forces B to live, it is not so big.  There are  larger urgent moves in the upper right corner and the bottom side.]
;W[rc]LB[pg:A]C[[EV\] W must have something better.  Even the simple play at A breaks a lot of B territory, since B must guard the cut.]
;B[qd];W[qh];B[rg];W[kj];B[ok];W[nk];B[ol];W[nl];B[pm];W[om]
;B[pk];W[mm]C[[EV\] The last few B forcing moves helped W more than B.  B had cutting aji here which is now gone, and the weak W lower side group is closer to safety.]
;B[lq];W[od]
(;B[pe];W[oc];B[nb];W[ob];B[pb];W[na]
(;B[cl]C[[EV\] W is too strong here for this invasion to succeed.  B should later just play the sente reduction shown in the diagram, leaving W with very little territory in this area.]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[em];B[gk];W[ek];B[ho]C[[EV\] Killing something big here looks like the last chance for B.]
;W[jo];B[ip]
(;W[iq]C[i think w can live but... miss

[EV\] Your other variation, where W connects out safely by giving up a few stones, leaves W comfortably ahead.  No need to take this risk.]
;B[jp]LB[hr:A]C[[EV\] This is a nice life/death problem.  I think W can play at the vital point A now and either live or escape, but I did not read it all out.

(;B[pi]C[[EV\] Why not go this far?  If W keeps pushing, B makes a lot of territory.  The cut at R8 is still large, but I prefer this faster development for B.]

(;W[ql];B[rl]LB[pm:A][rm:B]C[[EV\] W has joseki continuations at A and B which aim to settle the shape in one way or another.  A is simple but B can still get complicated if black decides to capture and aim for the cut.  Consult a joseki book for the variations.]
