I will indicate the variations with a "see variation" indicator.

Enjoy the review!]

*Yes, blocking R14 is crutial here. 
But it could also P13, snce you have some defending  stones around.]

;W[qi];B[ph]C[honjo23 [11k\]: that was the same move];W[rj]
;B[rg];W[si];B[rf]LB[nc:1][ne:2]TR[qc][pd][oe][of][pg][ph]C[Was that good of me to regain the corner?

*Yes White still have to make move to live below. Meaning you have the sente. Morover you have a strong wall. 
2 white stones attaching are very weak. You can make a big territory attacking them from left side.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[qk];B[ql];W[rk];B[rl]C[*S8 is too small but a big sente.
 Maybe KO threat later, yea?];W[sl]C[*W missed T9 for life]

*White missed T9 for life. Now he has to  Q10 for second eye.]

I'm mad I missed that];B[so];W[pj];B[rn]C[*Again too small to capture 3 stones. It is about 5 points. A large scale attack above or reducing E4 is huge.]

(;W[eo]C[I think white should have pincered because it would double as an extension

*True, Now the stones around M4 are all neutralized. G3 should be severe.]
;B[hq]C[see, now i was able to get a base

*Yes, an ideal jump for a base is definetely great.];W[jq];B[ho]
;W[jo]C[*K3 H5 K5 is moves are good.];B[hm];W[ni]C[odnihs [7k\]: ...idiot

Would a good move for white be around c10?

*Yes could be.

But, first of all, white's position is not really balanced. Because E5 after C4 is not a popular move.

If it was E4 or D6 instead of E5, There could be ideal extensions for white, so ideal reductions for black.]
;B[lm];W[jm];B[lk]C[*Since now you have 2 eye in R5 group you don't need to probe.
