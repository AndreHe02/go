C[A>
I'm Andre and commenting this game, as there is a probability that white being slayed, I comment for both sides]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ed]C[Game starts out normal.

A>
A mistake at white's side, by playing E16, white gave black a chance to invade upper left corner. E16 is a move that emphasize center and side]
;B[ce]C[Is this joseki?

A>
It is];W[df];B[dc];W[dd];B[bd]TR[cd]C[This is a misclick

A>
As said, should be at C16];W[pn];B[cd]C[Repairing the misclick]

(;W[ch]SQ[cj]C[A>

Did white thought anything about the effect of an invasion at C10 ?]

(;B[nq];W[hq];B[pk]C[A>
You should be careful of D4, if white put a stone at D3 in sente, black in trouble]

(;W[nn]C[A>
This is the worst solution ever, white is weak, he should touched other stone instead of running, besides, where will he asked help to ?

Touch the strongest group!];B[ml];W[ln];B[jc];W[mc];B[me]C[A>
Black is potimist that white has nothing to do except escaped. Frankly my dear, he's wishing dor am early christmas]
;W[ld];B[le];W[kd]
(;B[id]C[A>
This is what made him get out, try putting this stone at K15]
;W[je]C[How did he get out?];B[nc]C[A>
Remember one rule:
touching made both  side stronger.

white is weak and black is string, but black touch white.]
(;W[lg]C[A>
I think this move is an over play, putting astone at L14 will seperate this stone from its group and it must fight for life]

(;B[ng];W[ni]
(;B[oi]C[A>
You should try seperating this white stone from its group instead of touching it.]
;W[kl]C[A> white tries to take a very large moyo at centre without realizing that there are 2 big holes that can disrupt his plan]
;B[nj]TR[kf][mh]C[A>
at this point, black made pointless move, try moving to the hole instead]
;W[mi]C[A>
Hane -> extend

white close one hole, black miss one hole and helped white close his hole, what a nice guy he is]

(;B[md]TR[ec][cm][cq]C[A>
black close the whole and threaten white, a small point to threat, play around E17 instead, or C3, or C7, anything his choice]

(;W[lc]C[A>
when you are on trouble, try making 2 eyes! How ? you can start with one to give him trouble or 2 simultaneusly if you have the space]
;B[ke];W[jd];B[fc]C[A>
An encredibly weak move]

if only white follows the variation...];B[ie];W[jg];B[dj]C[This is wrong... isn't it?

A>
it depends on what you want, apparently, whis is not a bright move at all]

(;B[cj]C[A>
Yes yes, something like this
Note :
Everything that I show you at this variation, only to show you that playing at C12 is not the best solution

If you want to secure center, play at E17 1st to stop black's chance to invade the side while you goining a territory and a chance to secure the center

If you want to secure the left side, C10 or D10 is the best choice, you may only get a half of left side but that's what you get for playing at hoshi and E16]
