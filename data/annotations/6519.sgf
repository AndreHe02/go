C[Hey just like to say to the reviewer thanks for taking the time on my game and try to have fun reviewing.  I've only played for a couple of weeks now, but I have what I think is a firm grasp on the ideas and concepts of go.  I've played probably less than 100 games, but I'm studying hard and playing as much as I have time for to improve and become great =)

J: Good :-) just don't forget to enjoy the game!

As final conclusions:

- a pity you gave up the corners / then side so easily
- you were ahead most of the time - too shy moves in the upper area gave W the victory
- try to relax and look at the whole board from time to time - so you'll discover *big* moves far away from current action

No doubt you'll learn fast if you play this way after only 2 weeks!

I'll prepend all my comments with "J:" to make it easier to identify]
;B[qd];W[do];B[dd];W[po]C[Is there anything specific I should do when white plays two times so far towards the center like this?

J: Well, I think you got it - it is an odd opening for white, not bad for you entering the lower side]
;B[eq];W[dj];B[jd]C[Maybe D-7 here?  I thought it was too small so moved at K-16 to attempt to create a larger moyo.

J: I prefer k16, seems a bit too early for k7. Also I'd reinforce e3 before going k7, no need to fight now
K16 is big, but maybe h4 is better suited here, to establish a firm base at the bottom - I mean, E3 does not need help to live (can do that either side with ease) but h4 seems more in the flow of the game.]
;W[np];B[ph]C[J: hmmm here I'd rather Q10, disturbing his high shimari ... q12 seems a bit shy]
;W[pj]C[J: now W is happy :(];B[hq]C[J: I prefer H4, h3 confines it to the lower side. On the other hand h3 is more sure, but then I'd go to the corner if the aim is to make life]
;W[jq];B[io]C[J: not bad, but I'd entered the corner c4 or C3 depending on how sure you feel, before going right and escaping to the center. h3 secures a base, but that's easier and more profitable in the corner]
;W[jo];B[jn]C[J: this will probably help white. Theres a saying "you make strong whatever you touch"]
;W[dq];B[ko];W[jp];B[kn];W[lp];B[mn]C[J: this is small at this point. L5 etc I can understand, but now you should look for bigger points... D12 seems ok, p17 to play for sure and close that corner...]
;W[qh];B[qg];W[qi];B[pg]C[J: this exchange is good for you, W has made ... how many, 5 points? And you're radiating power now!]
;W[cf]C[J: this is good! white is taking the upper hand!];B[df]
;W[dg];B[ef];W[ce];B[eg]C[J: just as a side note: C16 is a standard move here, but of course you are free to prefer e13 if that makes sense with your strategy (giant moyo I guess)]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[cd];B[dc]C[J: again you gave up this corner too easily! Fight for the corners, really a lot of points there!!]
;W[fo];B[dm]C[I think this move was just being rash and responsing to whites F-5 with a push-over move that doesn't really mean much.  Can you suggest how I should have responded to white?

J: yes. Actually you should not respond to white, but rather go on with your strategy - of course taking into account w's moves. 

is F3 menacing anything? well, maybe the e3-h3 group, which starts to seem weak. F5 also contributes to enlarge white territory, so... how sure do you feel about e3-h3 futures? 
IMHO, you can choose among:
- reinforcing e3/h3 (maybe e2) 
- if you want to invade, i'd rather d8 or even e8, connecting lter with j5/k6 and leaving white flat.
- ignoring white and going for your moyo! k12?

My favourite move here, probably e8, but I'm a bit crazy ;-)]
;W[cm]C[J: this is w helping]

(;B[di];W[ci];B[bm];W[cn];B[ej];W[ei];B[fi];W[bj];B[di];W[bn]
;B[ek];W[el];B[dk];W[cj]C[J: just for you to appreciate the size: W has secured an area of about 45 points in the left. That's *big*]
;B[jr]C[J: wow, this exchange has been a bit of a mess!!! Please see the vars, I'll try to make something a bit more reasonable

Regarding k2, probably a good idea to reinforce, but j2 will also work and is easier]
;W[hp];B[ip]C[J: hmmm you'd rather forget about connecting, no easy way]

(;W[gp];B[gq];W[iq];B[ir];W[fq]C[J: wow, k2 in danger ;-)];B[fr]
;W[fp]
(;B[gr];W[er];B[es]C[J: M2 is bigger - you'll seriously reduce white's zone]
;W[dr];B[kp]C[J: at last!];W[kq];B[lq];W[kr];B[lr];W[in];B[ks]
;W[ho];B[mp]C[J: why not q3? you can live in the corner or connect to m2 via o2... N4 is small!!]
;W[mq];B[mo];W[nr]C[J: now you've helped him with his corner, in exchange of very little]
;B[no];W[oo]C[Is there anyway I could have pushed into white's lower right corner?  I felt like I was too passive somehow.

J: yep, I think so. Please see ideas before];B[mr];W[nq]C[J: this 2 moves are small at this moment, both yours and w's]
;B[pl]C[J: this, imho, is being destructive. With m11 or whereabouts you'll grow BIG and way ahead, no need to destroy w.]
;W[ql];B[oj];W[pk];B[ok];W[pm];B[ol];W[om]C[J: but a nice end - let's see ;-)]
;B[nm];W[oc];B[od];W[mb]C[J: I toyed with some variations, not too tought ... anyhow, after this, the game becomes very even. Just imagine if it were you the first playing here, maybe p17, closing the corner]

(;B[md]C[M-17 was better here for me?

J: I'd prefer M17, or L18,  yes, but it is difficult to say. It is very hard to defend such a big zone, and so open.

The idea should be: ok, w will live, but let's make him live small and where I want.]
;W[mc];B[hl];W[gm]C[J: this is big, yes, ... you'll discover how expensive center territory is :-)]
;B[gl];W[fl];B[fk];W[fn];B[im];W[hn];B[jl]C[J: now this is a pity ... not a bad idea, but no inmediate danger, and n18 can *grow*

L18 is the biggest for you now];W[jc];B[kd];W[kc];B[gd]C[Still too passive?

J: yep. It was too open to begin with, and probably w had to live, but not so big. Now your moyo is small, and in the center. I'll try to make some vars...]

;W[rj];B[pi];W[qj];B[ki]C[This move was purely out of fear of some random invasion.  Is it nessecary to play a stone like this - was my moyo too large?

J: your moyo is large, but with b all around (not near the edges to go for help) I can't see any future for w there.]

;W[ei];B[gj];W[di];B[hm];W[tt]C[Is there anyway I could have controlled the sides better?  While I did develope a HUGE moyo in the middle, the sides and corners just added up to more.  Maybe if I had done better on the left?

Thanks for the time in reviewing my game, I hope you learned something even if the game was very inexperianced. =)]
