C[
I'm playing white stones.

Opening? Is it good or bad?

Rixx: not bad.  You should always search your move in this order:
1 Strengthen your week groups.
2 The bigest free area
3 Play far from strength
4 Atack your opponent weak groups to gain points.

In the opening, We must always think in the opponent answers, like we do in the midle game.  I make the same mistake, one move can be big by itself but if you allow your opponent to make a good sequence it becomes bad.

My white group in lower (center) side?
My group in right side (near upper corner)?
(And the lower right corner group)
When those where alive? How make them alive?


I played too passively when I tought that I was winning.
  
I wasn't sure. I had my doubts.

Rixx: I think not, you were far from your opponent, in this case, better not to take risk]

I think this is good move.
I have to do it?

Rixx: It's an skillful net and you assure both sides, but I'd rather prefer a bigger move like both suggested. If black tries to safe his three stones, you will probably make lots of points chasing them.
In any case, but probably, the biggest move at this moment is to kill the inner black group, more than 30 points.]

(;W[cm]C[
Is this good move?

Rixx: I prefer the suggested ones, you are playing next to your strong stones, inside of your territory.  If black invades you in the left side at this moment, great!, he will be under a strong atack and you will make lots of points in exchange.  At this stage of the game, you have not to fear invasions.]
;B[jc];W[nq]C[
Is this good move?

Rixx:  Yes, I think is the bigger one at this moment. 
Usually, when the other player makes a double wing, it is recomended to invade inmediately at the san san, but in this case I think white must play in the bottom side first.]
;B[pn];W[jp]C[Rixx: good.];B[fp];W[fo]C[
Is this good move?

Rixx: I think so.];B[go];W[eo];B[hp];W[gm]C[Rixx: I think it is more urgent to strength the bottom group and then make points atacking the black group.  Even though, at the end, you succeded living in the bottom and making points in the left :-)]
;B[hm];W[gl];B[gn];W[fn];B[lq];W[jq];B[mp];W[jm]C[
Is this good move?

Rixx: Two space jumps use to be cutable.  Why not play first 42 and then 40.]

(;W[hc]C[

Is this good move?

Rixx:  No.  I think at this moment san san is the only move.   H17 forces black to make a good move, you should always take care of that.  I like G10/G11 too.]
;B[je]C[

This move is bad for me. I should have done this move?];W[qe]
C[

Good invasion attempt?

Right time to do this (invasion)?

Yes it is, you must invade now!.  

I prefer R16, R17 or S16.];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[qh];B[oj];W[qq]

This and following moves.
I'm trying to invade corner.

It's ok but your right group is still in great danger.   I think you should have finish with the left group before invading.]

I'm trying to make Ko-fight because my group is dying.

Is this move error?

It's ok. I think is the only way to live.];B[qr];W[ri]C[
This isn't very good threat?

It is not as big as the ko, but it is difficult to say, you have two groups in danger and this way you save one.]

Is this good move?

It is a good way to reduce black space later in the game, but know you need to make your grou live.]

I was lucky?
