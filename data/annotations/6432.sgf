C[Dear reviewer,
I'm submitting one of these very sad games, which I lost on KGS with black. Looking through it, I can't find mistakes worth more than 10 points - except maybe the way I handled my 3,3 invasion South East.
I'm a very territory oriented player who believes once you get half of the corners and borders you cannot be far behind. But even though I captured a w group that I didn't "deserve", I lost by a huge margin.
I wonder what you think of my opening and at which point I should have changed my strategy and start to reduce the w Moyo.

*Yes. defending the corner is better. Black's direction is good, but there is no reason to grant white a chance to attack the Q16 stone.]

*An ongoing attack is ALWAYS more important than reducing (urgent before big).

This is a very complicated situation. White must be careful about the cut at A. The white B and C groups are weak. The reason for these weaknesses are the slow moves white just played. Black should try to gain strength while attacking and splitting the white groups. Later black can quite easily invade or reduce the right side.]

[gs][hs][is][js];C[*Being territory oriented does not mean that you cannot reduce a moyo while building territory. If white wants to get a big moyo, he must defend the moyo at all cost, so you can easily force white to build while building 4th or even 5th line territory yourself. In this game, you played 3rd line too often and it was easy for white to build a lot without any resistance.

*What happened in the LR and TL corner was obviously disastrous. Black lost about 50 points there.

*Black was too passive and defensive sometimes and often attacked too late. If white creates a heavy group inside your territory, you must attack him.

*Black should try to split the white moyo. By just creating a stable group inside white's area, the moyo the limited in growth.

*The black mistakes in this game include direction of play in fuseki and midgame, and tsumego. I suggest having a look at these topics. There are some great books, you can easily find them.

*Overall, black played very reasonable for 6k. I think if black just evaluates the board better and begins to play 4th line, he can easily gain a few stones.

*OK, that's all for today :) I hope this review is helpful. ^_^]
