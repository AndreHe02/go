C[Hello,
in this game I tried to keep my own groups strong before doing anything else. But then I found myself lacking some territory and didn't really find a way to take advantage of my strength, all my invasions or attacks went nowhere... Any comments on how to do that better would be appreciated.
Thank you very much

Hey Thomas,

I've tossed in my comments and variations. It looks like overall, white played some unusual opening moves, but you answered pretty well and I think you came out ahead in the opening. However, white started to fight to get the lead back, and you made a few mistakes, specifically 4  bigs ones, which I have pointed out, that lead to white having a dominant position by move 103. My last comment is there, as the rest of the game isn't as interesting to review.]

(;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[nc];B[qf];W[ne]C[This move seems super greedy to me, but maybe that is joseki?

Greg: This move is unusual. White is choosing to ignore territory completely for influence in the center, but it's thin and not very useful. I think your move at A is just fine.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[jc]
(;B[ef]C[I wasn't sure about this move, but it does restrict white's growth and strenghtens the positon of black. So I thought it was a good move, but maybe it was too slow?

Greg: I think this is okay. However, I would have just taken the corner directly. I think it's a bigger move. His territory in the center won't really grow that big, but you get guranteed points. See variations.]
;W[cj]C[Then this move. Is this move too close to black's rather strong group? I was thinking about playing C6, but then there is still quite some space left for white to make eyes and black might fall under attack too. So I decided against it.

Greg: Taking the corner here is perfectly fine. Leave the invasion for later.]
;B[cc];W[dc]
(;B[jq]C[Greg: I think the approach here is better. If you think about this stone, it is low. You'd rather it be high. However, without the approach move, white can play the annoying move at H3. See variations.]
;W[fq]C[Greg: Now you are left with an annoying invastion at M3. However, fiixing it now is really slow.]
;B[pi]C[Greg: This is good. Correct direction.];W[qn];B[ql]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[qo]
(;B[qq]C[Greg: Generally you would extend here. It makes a small difference in the fight. You are strong here and want to attack as much as possible. See variations.]
;W[qk];B[pl]C[In the game, I believed this was a good move, leaving no aji and keeping my opponent seperated, but after white managed to live on the upper side, I felt the game was already a bit bad for black.

Greg: This move is correct.You must keep white separated here.]
;W[qi];B[qh]C[Maybe hane is too much here?];W[pj];B[ri];W[rj]
;B[rl];W[rh];B[qj];W[ce];B[be];W[qi];B[on];W[si];B[ph]C[I played this move because I didn't want to get surrounded. A move like O 12 for white seemed to do that. Maybe black should've taken a base first and not care about surround? 

Greg: I think this move is good. I don't think your follow up was correct here. The reason I like this move is because it threatens P10, which is painful for white. However, black being sealed in isn't that bad. E14 does a fantastic job of reducing anything white will gain in the center. If black just takes the corner, black has a certain lead.]
;W[rf]
(;B[qe]C[Greg: I think this is big mistake #1. This should really be a hane. The corner becomes so much more solid. See variations.]
;W[re];B[qc]C[Greg: So painful. Your corner is so much smaller now.]
;W[oj];B[ni];W[dl]C[Now white fixed, which makes me wonder if black shouldn't have invaded earlier.

Greg: Well, to be honest, that isn't a great fix. There's plenty of places to invade there still. Getting a chance to invade there would be nice, but black took a large profit in the bottom right. Black should still be satisfied.]
;B[md]C[Maybe the R17 group would've still needed another move? But I was getting nervous, because white already started fixing his weaknesses so I tried to aim at his weak points.

Greg: I think trying something here is fine, but you do have to be careful about your group. It might be work coming back and fixing S16 at this point. Is white gets that, your group is suddently not 100% alive, which is awkward. Hard to say though.]
;W[nd];B[kd];W[lf];B[kf];W[ke]
(;B[le]C[This atari was wrong, I guess but I thought after N14 white's 3 stones would be seperated, which was wrong.

Greg: Yeah. The other way is definitely correct. This is big mistake #2. See variations.]
;W[je];B[mf];W[lg];B[me];W[kb];B[nf];W[jg];B[lb];W[lc];B[mb]
;W[mc]C[Greg: ow... White got way stronger on top, while black got very little.]

(;B[dn]C[Trying to aim at another weakness.

Greg: Coming back to this area correct, but the specific points is incorrect. This is big mistake #3. Attaching under the 4-4 works really well here. See variations.]
;W[en]C[Greg: Normally, white shouldn't play this way, since black's thickness out of this will be nice, but the center isn't big, and the territory white gets is really big.]
;B[eo];W[do];B[em];W[cn]
(;B[dm]C[Greg: Normall just capturing is better. The value of sente here is really high. See variations.]
;W[cm];B[fn];W[pb];B[qb];W[lq];B[kp];W[mo];B[np];W[mp]
(;B[ln]C[Greg: I think here the direction is wrong. You should be pushing is towards your thickness which you just got on the left. See variations.]
;W[mn];B[mm]C[This hane was probably too much? Would just extending be better?

Greg: Playing F7 was probably correct. Better just to get rid of all the aji left.]
;W[oo];B[no];W[nn];B[om];W[nm];B[nl];W[ml];B[lm]
(;W[ol]C[phew, my opponents reading was incredible! Didn't see that move.

Greg: Er. It's actually a mistake... He should just plain atari.]

(;B[nk]C[Greg: Big mistake number 4. This is the losing move. You must absolutely take at P9. See variations.]
;W[ok];B[po];W[pm];B[op];W[pn];B[oo];W[rm];B[cl]C[this was stupid, I thought he had to answer at C9, but that was wrong.

Greg: At this point white is surely winning. After saving his stones on the right, he simply has more points. There's also a lot of aji with the M3 stones. Hard for me to find any more big mistakes that are really worth poiting out. For the rest of the game, you play a lot of moves to complicate the game, but white answers well and keeps his lead solidly.]

(;B[ok];W[nk];B[ol]CR[mk]C[Greg: this is a complete reversal. White invaded, and had that lived, he would have a considerable lead, but instead you have sealed it in with the potential to kill (ko). You also build potential points in the center.]
