C[Hi Eric,

My name is Riaan and I am a 4k player from South Africa!

I think you played a fine game, especially later in the fighting.  It seems to me that your strategy component is much weaker.  You have to remember a few things:

* Keep him seperated and yourself connected!
* Never have more than one weak group!
* Prioritise your moves correctly in this order:
  1. Defend weak groups
  2. Attack weak groups
  3. Make points];B[dq]C[miyako [6k\]: hi];W[pc]C[Rewn [8k\]: hi]
;B[qp];W[cd];B[co];W[jq];B[ec];W[nq];B[df]C[R: This is an extremely complicated joseki!  Not recommended!  If fighting is not your strong suit, you should try to avoid fighting :)]
;W[ed];B[dd];W[de];B[dc];W[ce];B[ee];W[fd]C[R: White is not making this easy! :D]
;B[cc];W[cf];B[ef];W[bh]C[R: Here is the first deviation from joseki, but this is an extremely complicated position.]
;B[gc];W[fe]C[R: This was a mistake by white.  The typical move would be G16 to continue placing some pressure on black, while at the same time extending the net around E14.]
;B[cg]C[R: This was a mistake.  It only helps white, unless you want to strengthen your corner at B16 by sacrificing E14.]
;W[bg];B[ch]C[R: I'm not sure why you chose this direction?  It is "chasing from behind" and results in an excellent hane for white.]
;W[ci];B[eh];W[di]TR[gg]C[R: This is a terrible postion for black.  White is gained a lot through this fight.  There are still some urgent things to be done here, however.  Unless you intend to sacrifice E14, which would not make a lot of sense, since you spent 6 moves there for some reason?  Do you remember why? :)

I imagine it hat something to do with capturing F15?  You should probably play around the triangle in order to put some pressure on white and strengthen your weak group.  You can then make some territory on the top side and save your stones while chasing.]
;B[pe];W[md];B[qc];W[qb];B[qd];W[rb]C[R: This can't be good for white, I think you can get something out of this!  The correct move is at P18.  You have to be able to cut N16 and Q17!  Maybe something around P17?]
;B[qi];W[fj]TR[ed][fd][fe]C[R: Now it becomes very difficult!  It is however still not too bad, white should have played from his weak side (the marked group).  He now forces you to weaken his group!]
;B[ff];W[he];B[hg];W[je];B[hd];W[id];B[ge];W[gf];B[gd];W[hf]
;B[gg]TR[he][gf][hf][ci][di][fj]C[R: This move is cutting two living groups, so it's not super useful.  What would happen if white plays here?  He would need to do a lot of work to capture the H13 stone and still not make a lot of points!  You still have some good access to the center from the right.]
;W[fq];B[pq];W[ql];B[lq];W[no]C[R: This is good!  R8 was a huge overplay.]
;B[lo]TR[ql][no][fq][jq][nq]C[R: Great!  Both marked groups are really weak now, while you only have one weak group!]
;W[qn];B[jo];W[kp]
(;B[ko]TR[lp]SQ[jo]C[R: Hmm, keeping the weak groups seperated seems a lot more important!  The marked stone can run to the left and to the top if it comes to that.  See variation...]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[mq];B[kq]C[R: Here you made a move without actually adding any liberties, while white gained a liberty.  Terrible move!]
;W[jp];B[mo];W[np]C[R: Now white is incredibly strong.];B[jr]
C[R: Too late for this...];W[ir];B[kr];W[ip];B[mr]C[R: It looks as if you've already given up the game.  This is as good as a pass.  You have to at LEAST keep this as a threat for later.]
;W[nr];B[oc]C[R: Yes, but now white is already stronger around K15.  Earlier would have been better I think.]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[pb]C[R: A strange move!];B[ld];W[me]
C[R: He should just sacrifice N16, which does nothing!];B[le]
;W[mf];B[lf];W[mg]C[R: Wow!  This looks promising :)  I can't believe white allowed this to happen!  He was weakened immensely without any real gain.]

;B[dm];W[fl];B[io];W[hp];B[ho];W[go];B[gn];W[fo];B[fn];W[eo]
;B[lg];W[kc];B[mb]TR[lc]C[R: You can't kill the corner group, why not connect? The triangle would make you really strong and threaten the K15 group at the same time.  This only "threatens" the invulnerable corner group.]
;W[lc];B[mh];W[of];B[oe];W[og];B[nh];W[qg];B[qf];W[qh];B[ng]
C[R: Why this move?  White is already connected.  All you do is take away one of your liberties!  Don't push into bamboo joints!]
;W[nf];B[pi];W[ri];B[rj];W[rh];B[qk];W[rf]C[R: If only you had connected!  You have to make moves that perform more than one action.

Eg.  Connect and attack or attack and make points, etc...];B[pf]
;W[oh];B[re]TR[mb][mc][nc][oc][qc][qd][oe][pe][pf][qf]C[R: It is extremely unlikely that you will be able to save your group, you should close him in at P11 and try to kill the O5 group or make territory in the center.]
;W[oi]C[R: This is not looking good :)];B[li];W[oj]C[R: Now your Q15 group is dead AND he's in your space.]
