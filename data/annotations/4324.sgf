C[Llywelyn:

I felt like I played horribly this game, but am uncertain  overall where I could have improved my results.  I ended up winning because my opponent tenukied at the wrong moment in the endgame.

In some ways it feels like I've gotten so caught up in tactics that I've lost sight of strategy.

Any and all help/advice is highly  appreciated.

[jfc\]: my comments have this prefix.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp]
C[Llywelyn: I detest the chinese opening, and so I like to play in this manner when I think it is about to form.]
;B[qk];W[kq];B[fc]
(;W[hc]C[[jfc\]: this is the wrong direction.  If black takes the corner (like eventually happened), black gets sente and can play on the left to neutralized white's influence.

doing the usual thing of extending along the right side to C14 or D14 should be fine.]
;B[cf]
(;W[fd];B[cc]C[[jfc\]: at this point I'm not satisfied with any variations I've looked at in the upper left.]

(;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd]C[Llywelyn: This is a deviation from jeongseok, but I can't see anything especially wrong with it?

[jfc\]: white has the option of pushing through at E17 but that variation does not look particularly good.]

(;W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[gc];W[gd];B[ck]C[[jfc\] black C9 is good.  he can extend two spaces in either direction so this stone is hard to attack

When you build a wall like the one white has at the top you'd like to have a stone at  D10 first so that if black plays in between D10 and your wall he doesn't have enough room to live easily.  

White traded corner territory for outside influence but white's wall at D16 is greatly devalued by the strong stone at C9.  This is why I don't like white's choice of joseki in the upper left (starting with H17).]

(;W[df]C[Llywelyn: this feels painfully slow to me, but I felt like I had to limit C14's movement, similar to with a three-space pincer.

[jfc\]: No, C14 is not important.  It is too close to white's thickness to be very useful.  What has white gained by playing this move?  If black really wants to he can still pull the C14 stone out without much trouble.

White has a defect at H16 that would be good to fix but this can wait.

Two related Go proverbs:
(1) play away from thickness
(2) drive your opponents stones towards thickness.

Instead of D14, I like white C7 (see variation).];B[cn]C[[jfc\]: ouch.  Black C6 is great -- it strengthen's C9 (and therefore reduces the influence of the D16 wall) in sente...]
;W[ep]C[[jfc\]: Contrast this with white playing C7 instead of D14.  Here black is camped out with a 2 space extension on the valuable territory in front of white's C4 shimari.]

(;B[bf]C[[jfc\]: black B14 is a mistake.  C14 isn't doing anything useful so why save it?  Black C12 is better (variation)]
;W[af];B[ad]C[[jfc\]: black can't make up his mind.  with B14 he starts to rescue C14 then with A16 he abandons C14.]
;W[cg]
(;B[ic];W[hb]
(;B[ec]C[[jfc\]: E17 is slow.];W[nc];B[hd]C[[jfc\]: black H16 is obviously bad.  White punishes this mistake nicely.]
;W[id];B[he];W[jc];B[ib];W[ia];B[gb];W[jb]C[[jfc\]: with K18, white has gained some ground back.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne]
(;W[qc]C[Llywelyn: All of my groups were going to live, and I figured I was slightly behind so I wanted an in on that framework.

[jfc\]: with proper play from black, white R17 expands black's moyo rather than reducing it (see black R16 variation next move).]

(;B[oc]C[[jfc\]: P17 is the wrong direction!  black has a nice moyo on the right side and he ignores it.]
;W[re]C[[jfc\]: white S15 punishes black's mistake nicely.]
;B[mc];W[qg]C[[jfc\]: excellent.  giving up O17 and even N16 is nothing to white.  Reducing black's moyo with R13 is huge.

The fact that the white stones at K17 are so strong is what gives white the flexibility to sacrifice O17 and N16.]
;B[ld]C[[jfc\]: compare what black has gained with his last 3 moves (hardly anything on the top side) verses what white has gained (the corner and side).]

(;W[kd]C[[jfc\]: the K17 stones are very strong but you don't want to let black confine them to the side.  You also don't want to let black's bad moves at H16 and H15 turn into good moves.  Moving out with J15 (variation) keeps H16 weak.]
;B[ke];W[nb]C[Llywelyn: This feels small.  Not tiny, but small for this point in the game.  E6, H4, O3, and Q6 all feel larger.  Is this correct?

[jfc\]: yes, O18 is gote and there are much bigger plays available.  O3 is proably the biggest.]
;B[mb];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb]C[[jfc\]: R18 doesn't work.  black should take a big point like N4.]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[sb];B[rd]
(;W[sd]C[[jfc\]: white R16 instead is better];B[qd];W[sc];B[qe]
;W[rf];B[pg];W[lc]C[[jfc\]: better to push out with J15 instead.]
;B[me];W[lb]
(;B[la]C[[jfc\]: O19 instead of M19 is better (variation)];W[ka]

(;B[na];W[qa];B[ma];W[np]C[Llywelyn: Should this have been lower?  I also keep eyeing playing Q12 and then following it with Q6 after B plays P13.

[jfc\]: no, O4 is good!  O4 threatens the follow up at Q5 where as O3 doesn't have nearly as good a followup.

As for Q12, black can ignore this and play N4.  As for Q6, why invade where there is not enough room to make ideal shape when you can make an ideal extension along the side?]
;B[po];W[hp];B[mr]
(;W[dm]C[[jfc\]: I don't like this move.  Black has ideal shape that is hard to kill.  Black also have thickness in the upper right that makes it hard for white to build a moyo in the middle.

Why not play the normal move at N3 (which is sente) forcing black to play O2.

then play D10 looking to cut the H16 stones off with J15 if you get the chance.]
;B[cm];W[dl]C[Llywelyn: is this the correct direction?

[jfc\]: while I dislike the should hit of D7, I think the correct continuation is to try to attack black's stones so D8 is better than other options (e.g. D6).]
;B[dn];W[en];B[do];W[dp]C[Llywelyn: Blocking in this direction turned out to be a mistake, but I didn't quite want to sacrifice the corner for the center.  In retrospect the other direction looks much bigger.

[jfc\]: no, you must play D4.  The center is small because of blacks influence in the upper right.  The lower left corner is big.]
;B[eo]C[Llywelyn: I wanted to block this directly...

[jfc\]: playing D7 and D8 implies that you plan to block at F5.  If you feel you can't block then you shouldn't play D7 to begin with.]

;W[ks];B[ir];W[iq];B[bq];W[bp]C[[jfc\]: crazy play by black.  If black just plays ordinary moves (connecting K1, then B5) he is leading.  Instead he invades wildly and loses ground.]
