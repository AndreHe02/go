C[That was my very best game ever played in official tournament. That was my second game against 2 dan player and I was determined to play my best.
Please make your comments to this game for things I should practise on.]

LB[qk:a]C[I never saw this move played. Usually its A.


It is common to play here . There are two choices for b to choose as marked as A and B. B is more popular and better for black.]
(;B[qh];W[on]C[There are three variations for b.]
(;B[mp];W[nc]LB[pc:A]C[How is better to responde? I didn't want to make weak groups against stronger opponent.

A is honte for b.];B[pc];W[gc]LB[kc:a]C[Unusual again. I would play A.




Yes. A is common.];B[ci]C[Here I knew that white has some weaknesses at the top and the right side, but didn't want to exploit them.



This is the big point.];W[ck];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[bf];B[bg]
;W[be]LB[ei:A]C[What is the shape move here?




A is good as you played.];B[ei];W[ne];B[oh]LB[jc:C]C[I looked through the possibility of invasion at A or B, but it seemed good for black, so I jumped to center.




Where are A & B? C is good for an invasion in this situation. And there is no need to response at the upper right corner and it is time to invasion. Otherwise, white is so efficient to surround territory on the top.]
;W[pf]C[What I was waiting for.



Black is hard to reponse.];B[of];W[oe];B[pe];W[og];B[pg];W[nf]
;B[qf];W[nh];B[oi]C[Good for black I think




Good for white I think];W[oj];B[ni];W[mh]C[It is good for w from T23 to this step. W created a great moyo on the top. It is much better than the ji b obtained I think.]
(;B[ek]LB[hd:A]C[This was a bad move. But how is best to erase moyo at the top?




A is the best.];W[ge]LB[ek:a]C[Opponent sayed after the game that A was thank-you-move.]
;B[mi];W[li]LB[mi:a][li:b]C[Is that exgange good for black or white?



Good for w absolutely. What did b get after this exgange? W's moyo becomes harder than before.]
;B[fo]LB[dr:A]C[Why not play A first for b? For gote no sente? Which is the only benefit for b that I could see from the following steps.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[eq]LB[cq:a]C[Bad for white. Should play A.



Yes. It is better to play A.];B[fr]LB[fr:A][ep:B][mn:C]C[It is better to play B and then tenuki to play C to attack the w group on the right side for b. A is just a big yose. Not big enough for this moment.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[ep];B[go];W[mn];B[ji]LB[jh:A][lh:B]C[Aim at reducing the top and expanding at center. Maybe there something better?


I'd rather play A instead. Aiming for cutting at B.];W[kj]C[It is unreasonable for this step.]
;B[jj]C[Blacks (mine) main time expired. Now I had 10 minutes for 20 moves.]
;W[jo]C[Don't know how to handle that];B[kp]LB[kp:A]C[A is the best reaction for b. It is honte.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq];W[mo];B[lp];W[jm];B[jf]C[My plan seems to work..





Seems good indeed.];W[jd];B[lc]C[My opponents reviewed this move as "very strong" is that right?


It is not bad.];W[mc];B[lh];W[kh]C[Why not play B?]
(;B[lg];W[ki]
(;B[mf];W[ld];B[jk];W[mk];B[kk];W[mj]C[This result is acceptable for b.]
;B[bk];W[ng]C[After that move I don't remember the order of moves but only local situations at yose.
Maybe some better moves at the local endgame are crucial.

The next exchange is really bad for w. Just 5 points actually.]

[ob:D][ro:E][rh:F]C[What does this exchange for? It is better to play B if you want the group which is in the center to connect with others. If w plasys A to keshi your moyo in the center, C is extremely large and reverse sente for you.]

(;B[ri]C[The following moves are the best order in my opinion. After that, there are some small value yose left. Black owns around 76+ points and white owns about 68 points then. Black will win the game if you did not too bad in yose.

That's all for my review. Remeber that yose is important. Please try to remebering the orders of yose in the following games.
This is the first time I review a game on GTL. I hope this review could  meet your expection.Thank you. Have a good time.]
