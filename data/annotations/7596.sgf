;B[pn];W[hq]C[This move didn't seem to threaten the D4 too much, so I decided to start playing more offensive instead of defensive.

Unusual style indeed. I think white just played this move to set up the trap, he was expecting you 'd build a wall. h3 would kinda neutralize it. Let's see how to ruin white's plans..]
;B[qi]C[This is a good idea. A move at D10 is also playable, but a bit shy.]

[jo][lo]C[At this point I realized my wall seems useless for I have no stone at K4. I think this isn't a joseki because of the lack of K4 too.

Should I have forced white low instead around the marked stones? Pushing from behind at E8 would help my heavy group but in exchange white would get so much territory that wouldn't do either.


It's not easy to find a good black move here. Splitting white seemed like the only option to get a chance to get your wall work out.]

;B[jk];W[mj]C[I would rarely recommend to play forcing moves, but it seems appropriate here]
(;B[oh]C[Maybe P12 was too early. White totally ignored this move and gained a double-attack on the left.

Don't worry, this is normal, black s already successful, as he could force white into living small.]

He was hoping for a blunder. B15 loses point. If he just wanted sente, he would b14. Anyway, even without that it seems unkillable]

(;W[ke];B[kd]LB[gb:A]C[Your aji was a good idea.];W[qo]C[I was surprised he went here, I had 4 stones here so I thought an invasion should be reckless.

Counting : 

White : 14 in Top left, 10 in top right, 10 in center, 3 at bottom, 5 on left side : total : 42
Black : Center 4, bottom left 2, right side : 53  Total : 59

Almost 20 points lead on the board, white can't catch up even with komi. Has to try something here, or the game is lost]

(;W[rn];B[qm]C[At this point I was confident that white was dead.]
;W[rm];B[sl]C[I didn't understand why he resigned. It looked like a close game to me.

So the question is, where did I go wrong so horribly? Surely it must have something to do with K2 invasion, I mean, having 4 handicap stones shouldn't make a game this difficult to win.

When having a high handicap, I always feel more afraid than white, and white's the one who should be afraid of my handicap stones...

You played quite well in my opinion, you made life when you had to, kept splitting white apart, forced him to live small and finally killed his invasion. 

The difference of strength is not that big between 2k and 2d, you just need to see some more simple sequences, such as the forcing moves in center, not to play worthless sequences ( the wall in the opening) and you should gain a few stones already]

Perhaps, if he plays well.. but it looks quite a gamble. There is lots of aji all around. If white fails to kill, he kinda loses twice, as he has given up top also]
