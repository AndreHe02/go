C[Comments for the GTL and Neil Mitchison (White) made by Erik Ekholm, Swedish 1d, in April-May 1997.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dp];W[ce]C[
  peterd 3k*: Guten Abend];B[dc];W[fd]C[EE: This is *Not* the position I would chose to play the taisha; Black is backed up by two hoshi, which will be useful in fighting. But I guess, in amateur go, it is more important to play joseki that you know better than the opponent, than those that best fits the whole board position. :-)

In any case, I can't complain of a lack of fighting spirit!]
;B[ed]C[EE: Objectively, Black should accept the challenge, which in my opinion ought to give a good result for him, but maybe he doesn't know the taisha well enough. Then this is safer of course.]
;W[ee];B[fc];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[ic]C[EE: This looks natural enough, but is a mistake; Black should crawl once more before jumping.]
;W[dd]C[EE: The correct way to punish J17. Ishida gives the variations shown.]

(;B[cc]C[NM: This surprised me, but I didn't
seem to manage to take advantage of
it as I'd hoped.

EE: Black will end up with too many cutting points.];W[ec];B[eb]
;W[hc];B[hb];W[fb]C[NM: I suppose this should  have been G18 to force the capture
of J17.

EE: Yes, that would be a great result for White. Especially since you've got the ladder.]
;B[gb];W[db]C[EE: It is highly questionable if this ko is worth fighting now. There are no good ko threats this early.]
;B[ed];W[ib]LB[jb:A][jc:B]C[EE: This ko threat just strengthens Black and White will lose moves like a) or b) later.]
;B[jb];W[ec];B[fa];W[cb];B[bc];W[bb];B[ab];W[ed]C[NM: I didn't reckon I had any chance
of capturing the B17 group, so I
decided to settle for walling them
off in sente.  Or should I have left the
aji for later?

EE: I think you should leave it, E16 is not very useful to you, and you may have a position later with more ko threats. It may also make Black feel uneasy. :-)]
;B[ba];W[bd];B[ca];W[ck]LB[cn:A]C[NM: The right extension?

EE: Any higher would be too close to the wall. a) might be an alternative.]
;B[op];W[lp];B[pm];W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[pp];W[qn];B[qq];W[qo]
;B[mp];W[rq]LB[lo:A]C[EE: The corner is always big, but maybe White should play for influence with a) here, to coordinate with the wall. But I may be wrong.]
;B[pr];W[qr];B[pq];W[fq];B[lo];W[kp]LB[rr:A][cn:B][jp:C]C[EE: This looks heavy. Black is quite strong since he has a). Maybe b) or c) is better.]
;B[cm];W[cq]C[NM: Or should I have reinforced the  lower side, say with D2 then H2?
It looked a bit lukewarm to me.

EE: But it would solve the problem with L4/M4. Invading the corner helps Black to make a moyo at the bottom and attack the White stones there.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fr]LB[hq:A][eq:B]C[EE: This must be a confusion with a joseki where we have a Black stone at a). b) is correct.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[eq]LB[hp:A]C[NM: I was sure B F2 was an overplay,
once he had played C6.

EE: A more relaxed idea is to play around a) and force him to protect the cutting point. That would make F2 look stupid, and Black's thickness would not be very useful either.]
;B[gq];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[el];W[gp];B[hq];W[hp];B[iq];W[ip]
;B[jq];W[jp];B[dj]LB[lr:A]C[EE: Black should finish with a). It is both big and makes him safe. White would then need a move to stake out some eye space above H4, after which Black could play D10. Evaluating this, we find that White's cut at E3 might not have been so good after all.]
;W[cj]C[NM: I should have ignored D9 and
played L2 at once, or else answered
C11.

EE: Yes, but I don't blame you for expecting L2 etc. to be sente - I would too. :-)]
;B[di];W[kr];B[kq];W[lq];B[jr];W[lr];B[ci]C[EE: This lets White kill the group below, which is of course very big, but Black C11 is a good move indeed locally: it takes profit, it makes Black completely safe, it denies White any profit in front of his wall, and this wall might even become a target of attack.]
;W[hr]C[NM: Now having killed the F2 group,
I thought I was comfortably ahead.
Was I?

EE: You have 35 points in bottom left and a few in bottom right plus komi, almost 50.
Black has 16 on the left and 15 at the top-left.

So, in secure territory, you are leading, but your E15 group may become a liability, Black has potential for more territory in top right, and sente, so overall it doesn't look bad for Black, meaning that you cannot allow yourself to relax.]
;B[rr]C[EE: Big and urgent, since it affects the eye base of two groups.]
;W[sr]C[NM: Although sente was big,
I didn't like to ignore this as it would
leave the R6 group scrabbling for life.

EE: Answering once can't hurt you.];B[qs];W[sp]LB[nq:A][pj:B]
[rp:C]C[EE: This feels slow, but maybe you can get an attack later by peeping at a). In that case it could be motivated. Another idea is to go for fast development with b). Black c) will be gote and you also has the option of anwering with T4, fighting a ko.]
;B[pg]C[EE: The right direction of play. The game is already beginning to feel a little difficult for White.]
;W[bh]LB[ch:A][bg:B]C[NM: Trying to use the aji of C9 to
ensure eye space for the C15 group.

EE: Interesting idea. Hard to say how good it is. It might be aji keshi as White also had a) and b)]
;B[bi];W[qi]C[NM: Was this a good point?  I wanted
to take territory, but more to neutralise
the remaining aji of Q7.

EE: This looks natural.];B[pi];W[qh];B[ph];W[pj];B[oj];W[pk]
;B[ok];W[pl];B[ol];W[om]LB[je:A]C[NM: It didn't seem to me that his wall
would be worth much, since I had the
walls above and below, so I was happy
to take territory (so I thought).

EE: Black will be aiming for a) to utilize his wall.];B[qg]
;W[qc]LB[rg:A][id:B][jc:C][ke:D]C[NM: But now I had to invade.  It
seemed to me that O17 would come under heavy attack (P17, L15 or
something similar), so R17 was better.
What would have been better? N16?

EE: This is very difficult, but Q17 could also be considered. White wants to get settled here without inducing Black to play around a), which would hurt the right side. But maybe White should play b-c-d first to nullify Black's influence.]
;B[pc]LB[je:A]C[EE: Now Black a) would make a really nice area at the top. I think Black is leading now.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qb]
(;W[rb]C[EE: I show an alternative way to play in the variation.]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[rf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qa];B[rk];W[qj];B[rj];W[qm]
;B[je]C[EE: This is very good point, as it builds a big area for Black while starting to threaten the white group.]
;W[id];B[jc];W[hh]C[NM: To ensure eye space as much as
for territory.

EE: Seems necessary.];B[if];W[gi]LB[gg:A][gf:B]C[EE: Interesting shape. I would probably have played a) since I would feel apprehensive about Black b) here.]
;B[jh]
(;W[mm];B[oa]C[EE: Black corrects the aji show in the variation to the previous move.]
;W[lj];B[rh]C[EE: More than 15 points, but protecting the centre could be bigger. It is always appealing to get (or as here, steal) sure profit, though.]
;W[ri];B[si];W[jd];B[kd];W[ke]LB[ni:A]C[NM: This was an overplay, I think.
I should have pushed in from below first
with something like M12; but still
I achieved the object of breaking
up his territory.

EE: M12 looks better - it has good followups, so it will certainly be sente. Peeping at a) before playing M12 is probably a good idea.]

;B[lg];W[nh];B[mi];W[ni];B[ng];W[mf];B[li];W[mj];B[ki];W[og]
;B[nf];W[of];B[me];W[nj]C[EE: This fight has ended; time to evaluate. Black has a lead of more than ten points. (White has less than 60 points, Black about 70.)]
;B[jk]MA[lo][el]C[NM: I was surprised he didn't defend
at P12 or P11.

EE: Me too. White can't make much in the centre, as Black has the two marked stones to reduce from.]
;W[hf];B[hm];W[jm];B[nr];W[oi]C[NM: Which was bigger, P11 or P12?
I couldn't decide in territory, so I
took P11 to ensure plenty of eye
space.

I still thought I was ahead... :-(

EE: They seem to be about equal in territory, but P11 is thicker.]
;B[oh];W[sd];B[ql];W[pn];B[qk];W[pm];B[rm];W[rn];B[bo];W[bp]
;B[bn];W[ep];B[bg]C[NM: Again I was surprised he didn't
defend at D6.

EE: He probably felt that attacking the eyespace of your group should be sente.]
;W[cg];B[bf];W[ch]C[NM: I realised he could save B13,
but I reckoned I could make eye
space this way. Was there a better
sequence?

EE: Not that I can see.];B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[dh];B[eh];W[eg]
;B[ah];W[cd]C[EE: Good timing!];B[da];W[dg];B[fh];W[fg];B[fj]
;W[ig];B[gh];W[gg];B[hi];W[ii];B[hj];W[ih];B[ij]C[EE: Small.]
;W[dn]C[EE: Good!];B[dm];W[fn];B[do];W[fl];B[fk];W[gl]C[NM: I was a bit shocked now on
counting to find that I was losing.
When did that happen?

EE: Hard to say for sure, but about 100 moves ago (see comments around there). Black's lead was mostly of pretty moderate size though.]
;B[hl];W[gk];B[gj];W[fm];B[jl];W[sf];B[sg];W[se]C[NM: Should I have left the ko
and attacked at T7?  The difficulty
was that the ko had dangers for me too.

EE: Yes, if he ignores your ko threat and captures at S16, T17 next kills your corner, so you'll need very big ko threats. Considering that you are losing this game, you could hope for complications in the ko, but here, I see no really fun ko threats.]
