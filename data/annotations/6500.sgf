C[Hi, this is a game i played on IGS as a 1d black, I've gotten a good start, but later lost to white's consistent invasion of my big center territory, im lost in some parts where i can't decide where is bigger, please give me some advice on how to look at the big picture..

reid: Hello Mike,

OK, let's see what we can do here.  First off, I'd like to examine your closing remark: "I lost by about 15 points to white, it was quite shameful. I've been playing for a while now and i really wanted to improve my game, but it seemed that it's harder to climb upwards as one progresses. anyhow, thx for looking at my game!"

Well, it's really no shame to lose, and losing by 15 points is exactly the same as losing by one point, or a hundred.  It's all the same in this game, which has has a significant affect on the strategy.  We'll touch on that later.

Yes, it certainly gets harder the stronger you get.  One reason for that is that  you now need to unlearn many of the things you've worked so hard to learn!  And right now, I think what you most need to work on is exactly what you mentioned above: the big picture.  Specifically, your perception of the big picture.  I like to think that the person who wins a game of go is the person who more accurately perceives the true situation on the board throughout the game.

The second thing I'd like you to work on is to avoid helping your opponent.  Amateurs are notorious for this particular go sin.  We learn early on that sente is good, so we hold on to sente even to the extent that we will make an exchange that helps our opponent more than it helps us.  This is a habit that has got to go.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[od];W[qo]C[reid: The big picture starts very early in go.

Here, white has played his first move on the 4-4 which means he's more interested in side and center influence than he is in the corner territory.  But when black played the early shimari with P16, white switched direction.  R5 declares that white is more interested in the right-hand side.  This is a bit inconsistent with his first move, but it is a reasonable reaction to P16.]
;B[dd]LB[qj:A][pq:B]C[reid: The corner is big, but taking this move now allows white a chance to use R5 effectively.  Black could also consider playing at A to build on his shimari investment.  Then white has to choose between the upper left corner and the lower right.  If white takes the upper left, black will get B and so the R5 stone won't be very effective.

Please note that I'm not saying that white R5 was bad or that black should play A instead of D16.  Rather, I'm trying to provide some insight into how you can look at the first few moves of the game.  The goal should always be to understand the meanings of the stones so you can make your stones efficient and your opponent's stones inefficient.]
;W[qi]C[reid: R11 is a critical point, and it's good for white to take it now.  Again, that's not to say black has made a mistake yet, but if white did not get this point now, it would probably be a mistake for him.]
;B[op]LB[ic:G][dj:F][cn:A][fp:B][kp:E][fq:C][oq:I][pq:D][qq:H]
C[reid: Here I think is the first real mistake:  as we noted earlier, white R5 is inconsistent with D4.  What that means is there is no good way for white to make these two stones work together to become more effective.  They  really only wok seperately.  So that means black doesn't have to rush to disrupt their cooperation.

So far, black's structure is larger than white's (natural since black has first move), so black should continue to build his structure larger while that option is available.  I'm thinking black A is a better way to make black's stones work together.  White might answer with B or C.  White still needs two moves, a corner shimari (D) plus an extension around E, to make this structure complete.  So black still has time to take F, for example.  Actually, even if white C, black F, white D,  Black G still looks bigger than E.  Black is building on a larger scale, and faster than white.

For these reasons, I feel that P4 is too early.

Here's another way to come to the same conclusion:  when white has R5, reasonable approach moves include P4, D(Q3), H(R3), and perhaps I(P3).  Which should black take now?  I certainly can't say at the moment which one is best.  When it's difficult to choose from several options, that's a good clue that you shouldn't play any of them yet.  Sometime later, after the game has developed some more, it will become obvious that one of these moves is the best move.  Or, white will take gote to defend.  Either of these outcomes is better than playing here too early.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[pr];B[fq]LB[kp:A]C[reid: P4, Q3, P3, Q2 are all joseki.  But F3 is not.  Of course, it's not good to follow joseki slavishly, but if you deviate, you should have a good reason and a complete plan.

Normal joseki is to extend to A, but that doesn't seem to be very good in this game.  White has secured a large corner and black is not exactly settled comfortably yet.  Which means that P4 was probably not a good idea (too soon).  P4 and P3 are the first specific case where I think black helped white.]
;W[cf]LB[jp:A]C[reid: Hmm, white chooses to avoid fighting.  White should take advantage of black's mistake before black gets a chance to fix it!  There is no good reason for white to try to start a new fight with C14.

I think a move like white A would make black very uncomfortable.]
;B[cm]LB[cn:B][dn:A]C[reid: However, this is a rather odd way for black to continue.

Black needs to think about how to make P4 and F3 work effectively together.  This is difficult because white has Q2 - any black position on the bottom side is already undercut.

Locally, if black wants to attack the D4 stone, A is the most severe pincer, and B is the next choice.]
;W[fp]LB[dn:B][jp:C][kp:D][eq:A]C[reid: "when you touch me, you help me".  The natural consequence of a contact move like F4 is that the contacted stone gets to strengthen itself.  White should think carefully here: does he want black to get stronger around G4?  That seems to help black join up with P4.

Perhaps a different contact move would be better:  white A followed by black F4 and then white B.  Now black is rather busy: an invasion around C or D would demonstrate that both black groups (F3 and P3) are heavy.  But black C7 is starting to look a little lonely too.]
;B[gp];W[dn]LB[fo:A]C[reid: Wow.  Of course white should extend to A.]
;B[fo]C[reid: Black takes the critical point.];W[dm];B[cl]LB[cp:C]
[ep:A][cq:D][dq:B]C[reid: Ahhhh, now black wants everything.  In go, that's a good way to end up with nothing.

How about if black takes the one stone with A?  If white swallows up C7 with C8, black takes a nice big corner with B, white C, black D.  If white defends the corner with B, then black can think about pulling out C7 (although jumping to C9 is a ligher way to get out than C8).

By taking the one stone, black gets excellent eye shape for the F3 group (pon-nuki in the center is woth 30 points).  That makes it much more difficult for white to attack the P3 stones (white doesn't get a splitting attack if one side is already alive or nearly alive).

But when black commits to saving C7, white will be able to control the game.  Black has too many debts he needs to pay off.

My usual rule of thumb is that if I see my opponent has two weak groups on the board, I think I should be able to win (of course, I never have two weak groups - heh, yeah right).

So if you don't want to give your opponent a good strategic opportunity, don't let yourself make more than one weak group at a time.]
;W[dl];B[ck]LB[ci:B][cj:A]C[reid: Again, jumping to A is lighter. And in this specific case, it prevents white from getting a good extension at B.]
;W[ci];B[dk];W[fl];B[di]LB[bh:B][ek:A]C[reid: This time it's black's turn to think about "you touch me, you help me".  Does black want to help the C11/C14 stones live?  Better just to come out with A (which black has to do eventually anyway).  Later, if white doesn't get a chance to strengthen those stones, black may get a nice move like B.  This looks like another case of black helping his opponent.]
;W[dh];B[ek];W[fk];B[ei];W[eh];B[gi];W[fh];B[fi]
(;W[ep];B[ho]C[i thought im doing pretty well here..

reid: Well, I thnk black is still helping white out quite a bit: that corner is looking reasonably large, and black's stones still aren't exactly what I'd call powerful.  But white has left a problem behind.  We'll get to it in a couple of moves.]
;W[gq]C[reid: Now this is very bad for white.  This is an endgame move concerned with only a few points.  At this point of the game, it's much more important to be thinking about life and death, cuts and connections, strength and weakness.  Unless white feels his corner stones are not safe, he should play somewhere else and leave this point for another 150 or two hundred moves.]
;B[hq];W[gr];B[hr];W[fr];B[fm]LB[hk:J][qk:I][el:B][pl:H][ql:G]
[gm:A][pm:F][fn:C][pn:D][qn:E]C[reid: Ack!!  This is a perfect example of helping your opponent.  White has a weakness in his shape here, but after white connects at B(E8), the weakness is gone.  The black F7 stone does almost nothing for black (no territory and no threat), but white gets to remove his weakness.

Without this exchange, something like black A might be sente (if white tenukis, black B, white C, black F7 and white is sealed into the corner).  That means black can think about building a large-scale moyo with something like D, black E, through white I.  Then black A and white probably needs to connect, so black also gets J.]
;W[el];B[co]LB[be:B][pn:C][bp:A]C[time to disrupt its shape i think

reid: Looks like A is a better corner probe.  But again, this is pretty much end-game stuff.  There are bigger fish to fry!  B and C for starters.]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[bp];B[bo];W[gn];B[go];W[cp]C[pretty good move, protected the cut..]
;B[bi]LB[bd:E][cd:C][be:A][ce:B][bf:D]C[reid: OK, here is a perception issue:  which stones are stonger, the C9 group or the D16 group?  Well, D16 isn't even a group, it's a single stone.  Clearly, black should "play away from strength" and help out his weaker group.  Something like A (B15) starts taking corner territory while attacking white's eye base.  If white B, black blocks with C, white D and black has time to connect the big move at E because white is not alive yet.

In the game, white ended up with about 10 points in this corner,  If black plays A here, he has more than twelve points.  Of course, he loses some on the other side, but only about three or four points.]
;W[bh];B[cj];W[qf];B[ch]C[i was wondering, was this bigger than the move white just played? i think white gained more benefit than I..

reid: No, this is a blunder by white.  Black clearly gets more that white here.  The proverb says "play the urgent move, not the big move".  White C12 is clearly urgent.

Actually, without this blunder, black has pretty much lost the game already (and we're barely 50 moves in).]
;W[cd];B[bd]C[reid: But what was black thinking here?  was this a 'clicko'?  Of course, black must hane at C17.]
;W[cc]C[reid: Ouch!];B[bg]C[reid: This is pretty small compared to the black corner changing into a white corner.]
;W[bf];B[de];W[df];B[fe];W[dc];B[id]C[reid: Trading the corner is a huge loss for black.]
;W[pn]C[reid: This move is also huge.];B[nn];W[om];B[nm];W[nr]
C[my big territory was reduced so much..

reid: Well, it was never your territory.  This is another perception issue.  As long as white has Q2 undercutting the foundation, black cannot expect much from the bottom side.]
;B[qk]C[decided to get the center from this move];W[pj];B[qh]
;W[qg]LB[ph:B][rh:A][ri:C]C[reid: White A looks better.  Simply join up with no complications.

Here is another perception issue.  black should recognize that he is behind in this game.  White has three rather large corners, and black has very little real territory.  Since losing by 50 points is the same as losing by one point, it makes sense to start making things complicated when you're behind.  It's time for black to start gambling.

After white R13, black A could give white some trouble.  White of course plays B, and then the question is if black can live after C.  White may be pretty sure he can kill black, but if there's even a small chance black could cause trouble, white needs to prevent that line.]
;B[ph];W[rh]C[reid: This way is pretty easy for white.];B[ri]
;W[rj];B[oj];W[pk];B[hg]C[so far so good..];W[jd]LB[ib:F][ob:C]
[gc:A][ic:E][mc:B][me:D]C[reid: This is the wrong starting point for white.

White should recognize that the entire area around A is neutralized by white's D17 stone.  So white should not be playing near this neutral area.  Instead, he should see how black responds to the invasion at B.  White has three reasonable continuations from B (C, D, and E or F), so he should have no trouble gaining life.]
;B[ie]C[i think this might be one of my losing moves because i lost the opportunity to gain benefit while attacking white at the same time

reid: I think it's black's only choice.  As I mentioned in the previous move, the area to the left of J16 is small.  Black needs to kill this stone to win.  To kill it, black's formations need to be strong.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[mb];B[ob]LB[lc:A]C[reid: I think black needs to try A.  If white P18, black can block at Q18.  A is a "shape" point for white's eyes.]
;W[jc]C[press B to continue]
(;B[je]LB[ic:A][je:B];W[hb];B[ic];W[ib];B[kd];W[kc];B[og];W[oh]
;B[pi];W[qj];B[nh]LB[re:D][mf:C][hk:A][nl:B]C[i think that im winning here a bit with my thickness

reid: I don't think so.  White has at least 30 on the right, 15 in the lower left,  8 in the top right and 8 in the upper left.  61 total plus komi.  These are all what white actually has already.  Several of those numbers could be improved fairly significantly.

Black has 14 on the left side and about 12 in the upper right.  Total 26.  That means black needs to get 61+6-26 or 41 points out of the center. And he needs to do that while not letting white get anymore points.  That's not going to be easy.  White has good reducing moves at A, B, and C (but he should play the big double sente at D before C to remove tha aji of black S13).

I have only a few more closing comments which can be found in move 122.]

reid: I don't understand what white is thinking here.  If he connects with A (or C if he wants to get cute about it), the game is reasonably close on the board and white wins with komi.  But if black cuts off the D6 group with B (after white J6), that's about a 20 point exchange and white loses.

Not a single move between now and move 138 (where white finally plays A) is worth as much as this.  Black *must* play B next, or he has no chance.

The go board is a large and complex space.  It is vital to see through to the true situation that the stones represent.  You duty as a go player is to think clearly and not get distracted by what you would like to see.

The second lessen is don't help your opponent.  That is something we amateurs do all too often.  Keeping sente is important, but even more important is that every move you make must be necessary. Make sure the exchange is better for you than for your opponent..  Never make a move that you don't need to make, just because it's sente.  And don't make endgame moves until you're in the endgame.

Analysis ends here.  Good luck, play strong, reid.];B[hm];W[hk]
