C[Potential4Life: hello :)


mira: hi

Hi, my name is Joachim and I will review this game for black. I am only 10 kyu myself, so some of my analysis will be wrong. I hope my comments are still helpful]
;B[pd];W[qc]C[The 3-3 answer from white is unusual. I understand that white's style of taking the corner forces you into making territory though influence, so your question how to use the influence is very valid.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]
;B[nc];W[dc]C[ok, you played the corner sequence correctly. Now, white has taken a 3-4 stone which is more territorial than your 4-4 stones. You can continue to play for influence or you could have started to also play 3-4 stones for territory. If you have never played 3-4 stones, just try and do it in your games. You might end up with a disadvantage in the first games you play 3-4 stomes because you do not know the 3-4 joseki's, but you can write the moves down and check the the joseki for the corect move. Once you are confident to play the 3-4 stones, you have the choice to answer an agressive territory strategy like the one by white in this game by taking territory yourself.

Your move on Q4 is the wrong direction of play. You have a large wall at the top facing left. Although there is a rule "play first in the corners", extending from this wall is more urgent. This is how to use your influence.

The small option (not so good) would be to play around J17 or H17. This ould make the territory between this stone and the wall yours. However, this is not correct, becuause the two white corners would be bigger --> not good.

A better option is to play at F17 and aim at the whole top. If white invades, for example at J17, you can chase white and your wall helps you to attack. You will not get territory right next to the wall, but you will have several moves to attack and then make points elsewhere, for example on the left side. See the variation...]

(;B[pp]C[As said before, Q4 is the wong direction for the wall. You should have played at the top and ignore the play-in-the-corner rule.]
;W[qq]C[Now, you have to chose a sode by playing at Q3 or R4. In this case, I am not sure myself. A stonger player would know...]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]
;B[qn];W[qi];B[rg]C[29 at S13 is the correct response. Keep White from connecting.]
;W[dq]
(;B[qk]C[Attacking is correct, but the wrong spot. One simple strategy you can apply is: before playing 31 at R9 think: if you were white, where would you play? Then you play where white wants to play. This strategy is not always correct, but often. In this case Black 31 on P11 would be much better. White can easily get into big trouble.]
;W[oi];B[ng]C[Same here: where would white pla? --> black 32 at N11]
;W[pk];B[pl];W[ok];B[nj]C[good idea, but a but too close. Better at N10]
;W[qj];B[rk]C[good!];W[ol];B[pm];W[ni]
(;B[si]C[This moves connects two groups that are alive already. Therefore, it does not connect anything is is a complete waste. There is no need to connect groups that are alife. If you think, that one of the walls could die, look at whites group: it is much more unsafe. Having an unsafe group close to a group that is yours is good news: if you want to make eyes, just attack a bit and you can make eye shape. Here for example at Q12 or P7. However, you should not play these moves now, they should just give you the self confidence not ot connect and to continue attacking.

How would I attack? Helping the O0 stone, for example. With N10 or even P10, taking away a possible eye for white. After P10, black is not easy to catch, see variation.

Or apply the "where would white play?" strategy. White would ant to play at M11, N10, O8. There you have some nice attack move candidates.]
;W[jc]C[Brilliant move by white. Remember my comments earlier about how to use your territory? Now, the black wall will not generate many points for you. You can still answer well, for example by playing at H17. See variation.]

(;B[cj]C[This is a good invasion point with the possibilities to make life at C13 or C6. However, if you can attack, you must attack first and wait with the invasion.

Attacking points that you could look at are H10, N10, O10, N8, and M11. All of the resulting variation would make your invasion on the left side stronger, because youe invasion stones on the left could run to the stones that are attacking the white group on the right. A good example of "everything is connected".]
;W[co]C[Now, white has all 4 corners!

To go back to your question about how to make use of your influence: Attack! See the previous comment for possible attacking points.

What I have learned is that attacking is great, because if you attack smartly (each move has 2 purposes), you get many moves for free.

For example, people like bug moyos. Why? Not because they are territory, but because if opponent needs to invade at one point in the future and then you can attack. You will probably not be able to kill him, but while attacking, you mke anorther section of the mojo territory. 

So, because you ahve the white group on the right and the K17 stone close to yur wall ready to be attacked, your move on C10 was a mistake.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[cl];B[ej]C[See, suddenly, you are the one beeing attacked. It should have been the other way round.]
;W[gc];B[ip];W[gq];B[iq];W[mr];B[lq]C[At this point, white has a lot of territory, because white has all 4 corners. You would need to do something radical like killing the white group on the right to win.]
;W[dg]C[White splits your two groups. You shoud connect.]
(;B[ff];W[di];B[dj];W[fh]C[move 63 at C12 is a bit too early. In the beginning of an attack, make yourself stonger first.]

(;B[ch];W[cg];B[dh];W[eh];B[ei];W[bh];B[ci];W[ef];B[fg];W[eg]
C[Here, you could think radical: It looks loke I am not going to be able to save both my black groups on the left. Lets save at least one and use the other to make territory.]

(;B[ed]C[This is super dangerous. Two weak black groups against one weak white group...]

;W[cm];B[dm];W[dn];B[fl];W[hl];B[gn];W[en];B[fm];W[kg];B[jh]
;W[li]C[Here your group around F15 is fighting for life against the whit F12 group, but it is not looking good.]
;B[mh];W[mi];B[kh];W[lh];B[lg];W[kf];B[id];W[ie]C[At this point, you have lost the game, your black group at the top left is dead if cou cannot connect towards M3, which is not easy.]
;B[ij];W[hj]
(;B[ii];W[ih];B[hi];W[gi];B[hg];W[gh];B[jg];W[ji];B[jj];W[ki]
C[I stop commenting here. I did not see a mayor mistake in your laster moves, but the game is lost at this point.

But is shows that even if white invades you nive territory next to you wall, you can make territory elsewhere while attacking.

One of the things that I am still learning is not to attack blindly or to attack to kill, but rather to play moves that at the same time threaten to kill, and prepare to make territory elsewhere. If no territory can be made, you should not attack.]
