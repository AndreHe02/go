C[To my dear reviewer :

Hello and thanks for taking the review. This game was played in a quick game live tournament (30 minutes + 5 min/20 stones). Most of the game was noted but not the last moves.

The beginning went easy for me (black) but I've done wrong after. I need advice on where I screwed the game. I've ended losing by 17,5 points

Thanks for all the help you will give me !


W. Hello dear reviewed :
I'll mark all my comments with a "W:" 

First of all, I'd say that I don't dislike white position after the fuseki too much (let's say at move 40), as black had made some of his stones quite slow (see the triangle marked stones at move 40)

I decided to treat all your variations as if they were the real game, even though I know some very only meant as ideas =P

I cannot pin your loss down to single moves, but the result of the lower right (thinness) after white 24 and black 93 seem like important turning points to me

Finally the biggest problem I can see in this sgf is in some of your variations. You reviewed your game, which is very good, but when you play an alternate variation, you must put a lot more effort into white countermove. It is very important that you help white in your reading, no he will not autoatari (ok, I exagerate). The solution I'd suggest is the one I use myself, some tsumego books don't include solutions, and thus force you to read for your opponent. try solving the elementary cho's elementary (if you find them too easy, do them very quickly, high dans and pro do easy tsumegos too ! (very very quickly) then switch to intermediate and finally advanced)

Here they are : http://tsumego.tasuki.org/?page=tsumego
(there's a very nifty a5 printable version)

Finally, on tsumego, I'd just like to add that solving the tsumego is not as important as improving your reading skill, if a problem resists you for too long (3-5 minutes) skip to the next and come back later.]
