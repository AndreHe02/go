C[Better to play at one of the marked spots.   Stake out another
corner, as Black (with proper play) already has this one.];B[np]
;W[nq];B[mp]C[The first thing I notice is that both players are concentrating
on one corner.  Normally it is best for each to play a stone
in one corner, typically giving each player a head start in two
corners.   The reason for this is that it's easier and safer
to make a stable (if not living) group in the corners, then develop
from there.  It is normally a little bit harder to secure territory
on the sides and much harder in the center.

Try this experiment, starting with a new board.  Black puts three
stones in one corner while White puts one stone in each of the
other corners.  Who looks better?  Not Black!  So White put himself
at a disadvantage by beginning this way.];W[pq];B[qq];W[pr]
;B[qr];W[lp]C[VipassanaMan: This felt like a bad start and that I came out
behind on this corner?

VipassanaMan: I wrote that when I thought I was white. lol. So
now i've remembered which colour i was playing as..... was this
a good result for black (me)?

Whether you are "ahead" or "behind" in this corner is almost
meaningless at this early stage.   Even though White has definite
territory and Black does not, I would say the corner is better
for Black because of its upward influence along the right side.
More about this notion later.];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[cf];B[fc]

;W[dj]LB[dp:C][dm:D][pj:X][dj:B][di:F][dh:E][cf:A]TR[qr][qq]
[pp][np][mp]C[VipassanaMan: Too far a jump?

Yes, too far.  But Black should ignore it to play at X.  This
will give Black a huge advantage, helped by the influence of
the marked stones.  Failing to capitalize on this now contributed
to Black's eventual loss.

Regarding your extension question , generally two-space extensions
are best in open areas.  Three or more can work if you have other
stones to help (as Black does).    Also, you want to consider
what you may do next.  A further extension to D could be logical.
Now suppose Black wants to make mischief by invading that side.
Where would he go?  Exactly at E, where he played the next move.
So you would have done better to extend in a large knight's move
only to F, which does not give Black an attractive target.]
(;B[dh]LB[pj:X]C[This is an OK forcing move but it overlooks the much bigger (and
more urgent) move at X, which is what Black should play (see
variation).

In this commentary I will generally not critique small tactical
details because with a few noted exceptions,  both players played
accurately enough on a local level.  What I saw missing in their
thinking were things like whole-board awareness,  recognition
of urgent moves and controlling the flow of the game.

PLEASE CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE SUGGESTED VARIATION AND ITS IMPLICATIONS.]

;W[fj]LB[pj:X][kd:Y]C[VipassanaMan: I thought his jump was too far but that i didnt
punish him?

So far Black is OK.  But I would label the next move a problem.
Invading at A is relatively small.  You have MUCH bigger moves
at X, as mentioned earlier, and at Y, which is smaller but analogous.
You may not be able to makle both these moves, as they are equally
attractive to White.  If you play at X, White will probably play
at or around Y, or vice-versa.   This is a basic go concept called
miai, which you can check out at Sensei's Library, http://senseis.xmp.net/.]

[cq][dp][do][dn][dl]C[Good!  Now you (Black) are finally using influence. by playing
at Q10.

Speaking of influence, notice all the outward strength projected
now by White's marked stones.   Another word for this is "thickness"
(see Sensei's Library).  How did this happen?  When you were
securing your invasion, White's defense built up this outer wall,
which is worth a lot more than your 10-12 points of territory.
White can secure this large territory by playing at E, or by
trick to strengthen his stones on the right (variation).

Notice too that Black's potential invasion at D has been ruled
out.  That is another casualty of Black's invasion on the side.
It might have been possible to play at D first and then, depending
on how that worked out, to play the invasion later.   Some moves
must be properly timed.]

[ef][pd][pc][fc]MA[qb]C[X would be better, although this does help keep White out of
the center.

Note also that Black's thick wall protects the top side just
as White's protects the bottom side.  

There is actually quite a bit of thickness in this game (marked
stones).  Black has more than White so, even though this isn't
territory yet, Black is slightly ahead.  There is a go proverb,
"Stay away from thickness."

Thickness makes invasions difficult.  Still, White should think
about invading at or around A if Black doesn't secure it first.

Black's idea (after defending at A) should be different.  Placing
a stone at B would probably cause White to play around C in order
to make safe territory underneath.  That gives Black an opportunity
to extend from B upwards into the center.  If Black is able to
place 
another stone at D and can also save B somehow (connect or make
eyes), he will have a formidable position.  

But of course it's still White's move...];W[qg];B[pg];W[pb]

White's invasion should succeed but needs to be farther to the
right, allowing rooom on both sides.   Best is for White to invade
at B.  True, that leaves no more room on the right, but it directly
threatens Black and he must answer.  If Black connects the weakened
stone,  White can extend to C and probably live small if he plays
accurately.  If Black does not connect at B but defends at D,
for example, White can capture (or bridge under) the marked stone
and reduce Black's 
territory.];B[jc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[ic];W[gc];B[ja];W[fb]

because those stones are essentially dead.  I would prefer A
to the move played because Black would probably answer the peep,
allowing White to push in to the area above (variation).   

Another choice is to capture at B, allowing White a few more
liberties.  This might create useful ko threats, for example,
or require Black to make unnecessary moves to kill White's stones,
or give White an extra chance in case Black makes a mistake.

In fact, the latter is what happened.  These marked stones, though
"dead", had aji which allowed them to help capture Black and
thereby live.  You can read about the term aji, which means "taste",
at Sensei's Library.];B[mj];W[nj];B[ni];W[oj];B[oi];W[om];B[on]

side territory.];W[iq]LB[jq:B][fq:A]MA[lq][dq]C[Generally contact moves are not the best defense.  White should
focus on denying Black the eye space necessary to make life.

A or B are better plays for White, but in either case Black can
make a two-space extension in the other direction by peeping
at one of Xs.  This could make it a tough fight.];B[eq];W[dq]

TR[kc]C[Notice how the aji of White's dead stone aids in this capture.
If Black had removed it earlier, he could answer White's threat
by simply connecting at B. 

This said, Black's four dead stones have a heavy and inefficient
shape.   Even if alive they don't increase Black's territory,
although they do reduce White's territory by 4 points.  However,
when White captures them, White obtains a double benefit: 4 more
points of territory plus 4 captive stones.  So the scoring balance
shifts 12 points now in favor of White!   

Clumpy eyeless shape like this are inherently dangerous because
they are profitable and relatively easy for an opponent to attack
and kill.    In a few situations such shapes may be necessary,
but unless you know exactly what you're doing it's best to avoid
them.];B[jf];W[id]C[VipassanaMan: And this annoyed me further, again felt like it

VipassanaMan: Overall I feel like this is a game i could have
won by not making a few big reading mistakes that led to me losing
groups i could have saved - but maybe im wrong.
But even so, I thought I was actually AHEAD at the end, was surprised
i'd lost, especially as i'd killed such a big group at R15 etc.
So, still a bit perplexed why I lost!

Overall, I think Black won the spatial battle in spite of overlooking
some  big territorial moves (see discussion starting around move
16).  Mainly he lost by letting 15 stones (marked) be captured
unnecessarily.   White played sharper tactically except for the
upper right corner, which he lost, and Black's group on the left
side, where he missed an opportunity to kill.])

to be before White gets a stronghold there.

at D and reaches into the center.   It doesn't make much sense
for White to try to kill him, so once things settle down a bit,
what is White to do?  He will invade the top around A or B.

Of course, the game might not unfold that way but, it it does,
Black would do better by playing at E instead of D because (1)
it threatens to isolate White's marked stone, (2) it will strengthen
Black in the upper left, and (3) this influence (thickness) can
be used to contain White's expansion once he invades.  If this
