C[Hello, dear reviewer.

Thank you very much  for taking your time to review this game.
It is a game from a big russian online tournament, organized by Sente club. I played black (without a komi) and won it by 2,5 points. This game was relatively slow (40 min + 5x40 byo-yomi) and I tried to play it very seriously. Inspite of some silly mistakes, this game was very interesting and I will be happy to hear some comments from a stronger player.

There are some questions and thoughts, I've added to the sgf, but fill free to comment on any moment, you might find important.
Thanks again!

P.S.: sorry for my bad english];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dq];B[de]

(;B[cm]C[Crazyone:
maybe it was possible and better to play e17?

Yes it is possible. But I would not call c7 a mistake.];W[en]
(;B[cj]C[Crazyone:
this move is low, but I was afraid to play d10 because of white e6.

Good thinking.];W[fc]
(;B[oq]C[Crazyone:
first of all, I want to prevent white kakari, which will give a perfect development of his thikness, and ofrourse, I like to enclose the corner too.

good fuseki so far!];W[qj];B[ql];W[qf];B[qh];W[of]LB[fc:A]C[With A being low, there is not much to be earned on this side, so I would play a saver move here.]

(;B[qc];W[pi]LB[nc:C][qc:A][nd:D][rd:B]C[The A-B exchange is nice for w and I would prefer D to be at C.]
;B[iq]C[Crazyone:
At this point I choosed between making a double-wing formation on the bottom and playing l17 on the top. Because the top  is developable for black, but not for white and the bottom is developable for both sides, I played on the bottom.
Now I think, that evenwith f3 in reserve, j3 is too close to white thikness. Was k3, or even l3 more balanced?
By the way, wasn't it better to play on the fourth line?

I like j3. I am not stong enough to say if anny move is better but the difference cant be big. You show good judgement here and nice reasoning.]
;W[kq];B[fq];W[jo]LB[ep:A][kp:B]C[I think w is overplaying here. A and B a serious weakneses.

First consider the ladder after the cut at B.]
(;B[io];W[in];B[ho];W[jn]C[Crazyone:
now I see, that f3 wasn't really a good plan. Was there any better ways for black to answer l3? Maybe j5 or even k5 was more active?

j3 was great.
L3 was bad.
f3 was perfect.
k5 was an overplay.
J5 was horrible and turned the tables.
 Why? You attach to a weak stone and strenthen white instead of attacking.]
(;B[hn];W[hm];B[gm];W[gn]C[Crazyone:
in the game I missed that f6 atari works well for black. Was it better, than the actual move?

It does not work well.]

it looks like white wanted to finish this game quickly and missed e11.]

 I'm happy to play this move and catch the white stones. Maybe a bit too happy to play calmly later on :(]
(;W[qn]C[overplay.]
(;B[rk]C[Crazyone:
I got a feeling that I'm doing something wrong here. q7 looks more active, but in the game I wasn't able to read the possible continuations deep enough and played submissively :(]
;W[pm]
(;B[pg];W[pf]C[Crazyone:
I think fighting is my weakest skill in Go :(
Was it more important to cut white with q8?

I think that the problems here arise from s9.
Why move on the second line, when you have a nice move like Q7 on the 4th line.
The fight is between r8 and r6, so r8 should move upwards and not fool around.
The fight is not over now, but it is difficult whereas r6 was a clear overplay that should be punished with the simple Q7.]
;B[rj];W[og];B[pl];W[ol];B[qi];W[ok];B[rm];W[lc]LB[om:A]C[Crazyone: Heh, black destroyed some white territory on the right, but got very little himself and in compensation white builded a very nice wall. It's unlikely, that black can be satisfied with this result, yes?

Yes. Only good thing about it is the cut at A.];B[me];W[lg]
(;B[mc]C[Crazyone:
is this move too defensive?
Maybe l15 was better?

Yes.
The exchange N17 for m16 is bad for black. Even the immediate S17 is better.]
;W[ld];B[rc]C[so b intended to live small. Bad idead.];W[ii]
;B[gd]C[Crazyone:
 I think, that this move, provoking the unreasonable fight, is one of my biggest mistakes in the game. Was it better at  g15. Or maybe there are something bigger for black in the other parts of the board?

I think n17 was a bigger mistake.];W[fe];B[dd];W[ec];B[cc];W[bc]

(;B[be]C[bad endgame.];W[bd];B[jd]C[Crazyone:
another dubious move.

Seems ok to me.

Hmm. White was near to death after this move...];B[ff];W[ge]

after ~1,5 hours of playing (and 8 hours of working before the game) I was too tired to read out the semeai, so played this move. But now it looks like k3 worked for black too.

Is this sente?]

finaly black won this game by 2,5 points (there was no komi). I think, that I was very lucky to capture white in the beginning, but made alot of mistakes later. Anyway, this is my first win against KGS 1d in a 1-stone handi and I really enjoyed this game.

Dear reviewer, thanks again for help!
Maybe you could give me some general advices, how to improve my Go?

Kind regards,

/Igor' Grigor'ev (Crazyone on KGS)

You played well.

Your fuseki is fine.
Your fighting lacks confidence. You give up some fights that you might win. 
The most important points are:
1 should be at A - be prepared to fight when you are stronger!
2 should be at B - this is just a reading problem.
3 should be at C - again: be prepared to fight when you are stronger!

Your endgame is ok, but sometimes you lack the confidence to play more difficult moves - like at the points where you played 4, 5 and 6.

Feel free to ask questions if you like.

Greetings 
Klaus])
