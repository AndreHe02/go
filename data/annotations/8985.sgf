(;W[de]C[Tami: a bit slow using the Shusaku diagonal as White in a no-komi game. Still, it`s a strong move.]
;B[gd]
(;W[ci]C[Tami - I could be wrong, but this feels too close, as though you`re not getting value for your strong but slow shape in the top left.]
;B[fq]
(;W[cl]C[Tami - I think this is over-concentrated. White`s stones on the left are not mapping out much territory. I`d choose a move like R14 instead.]
(;B[jc]
(;W[jq]C[Tami - Black is low on the bottom, so does not have so much scope for expansion here. Again, the top right looks more promising.]
;B[qj]C[Tami - good direction, but Black is low on the sides, making 3-3 good for White now.]
(;W[nd]C[Tami  - this is asking to be attacked. The 3-3 point is both easy and good, because it is hard for Black to make a big enough moyo with low stones at K17 and R10.]
;B[mc]
(;W[qc]C[Tami - it`s the right idea, but the exchance of O16 for N17 is good for Black. He ends in sente now.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[nc];W[oc];B[od];W[nb];B[mb];W[oa];B[el];W[ne]
C[Tami - this is a wasted move. Cutting stones have value only if they are dividing *weak and attackable* groups]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[pg]C[niallp [5k\]: c: clearly now has double wing
niallp [5k\]: c: and cutting stones arent doing anything.

Tami - yes, Black can`t be unhappy. Still White has sente and can think about abandoning the "cutting stones". Cutting stones are only worth saving if they divide weak stones, but since Black is already alive on both sides they have no value.]
(;W[ep]C[niallp [5k\]: c: thought to pressure corner and build side out while cutting of black e8, but it all went a bit wrong.

Tami - locally Black has more stones, so the fighting is stacked in his favour.]

(;W[gk];B[do]C[Tami - I think the main lesson here is not to try to kill things when you have big weaknesses in your own position.]
;W[eo];B[cm];W[bm];B[bl];W[ck]C[niallp [5k\]: oops

Tami - it`s a natural outcome, though. Black had more stones in the area to begin with, and you had two weaknesses to patch (E5 and C7).]

;B[op];W[no];B[oq];W[lo];B[oo];W[po]C[Tami - it`s not reasonable to try to live on both sides at once.]
(;B[mo]C[Tami - this looks wrong. Black should have hit at the head of two with Q5.]

C[Tami - unreasonable to save this stone when you have a weak group nearby. You might find it better to save moves like this until they make a serious threat to the opponent.]
;B[lm];W[jl];B[hn];W[gm];B[jp];W[kq];B[kn]
(;W[pr]C[Tami - as Black is dead anyway, this move is basically a "pass".]

bigmistake [7k\]: thanks

niallp [5k\]: bye

Tami - the main lesson is to "pick you fights carefully". 

Also, think about efficiency - don`t play near strong stones and groups.

Finally, remember that cutting stones only mean something if they are cutting groups you can attack.

Have a good year and enjoy lots of great go games!!])
