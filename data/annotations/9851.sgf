I (chmooze) played white. While I won the game there was clearly room for improvement, I'm focusing on tesuju right now so would appreciate if you could point any out that I missed

And that is it. I gave him more in the end game then I should have, but pulled it off, despite my rather grevious mistake on the bottom. Thanks for you comments and help!


[ The loss of the bottom was bad but not decisive. 

You sealed black in and got some influence when he settled on the left, but then you let it be destroyed when the 2 black groups connected. If you compare the position at move ~85 with move ~100 you will see that white lost significantly. 

It is also interesting to realize the several misplays black made from move 100 till the end, as white got most of the open territory in the top and right sides of the board.]
