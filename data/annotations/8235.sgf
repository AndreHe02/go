C[Thank you for looking at my game.  I play white.  I won this game, but only because black misread how to live at the end: I think I was at least 20 points behind before that.  If you can help me see where I went wrong, I would really appreciate it.

Xinwen:::

Hello i'm your reviewer, i will provide as much help as possible.

During the review, i had few friends reviewed the game together with me.

TW (4-dan)

END COMMENT:::

I will put the opinion regarding the game here.

Overall it is quite clear commented from this game certain issue at which you need to work on such as

1) direction, of how you should put pressure on opponent's weak gorup.
2) how you should plan and execute it.
3) how you must look at little detail and judging who is leading or not.
4) when not to take unecessary risk.

That is all.

Thank you.];B[pd];W[dc];B[dq];W[qp];B[co]LB[iq:A][kq:B]C[Xinwen:::

Follow A or B to see suggestion.]

Xinwen: what you think KX?
KX: For me, I think it's style..
TW: ok ba...(it's okay)
PC: i think here(j3) or there (l3) better. because extend at g3 doesnt give much impact to shimari.

Option Path:::

Black continues at B basing on Professional games]
