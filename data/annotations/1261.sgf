C[I (fess, black in this game) used to win lots of games by building a better moyo than my
opponent which I do in this game. Now, I find that I lose unless I can mount a successful
invasion or use effective reducing moves or chase a weak group. I didn't do too well at any of
those things in this game. How could I have done better?

Mark Vytlacil

I think the main difficulty b faced here was allowing w to control sente in a few key places.]

;B[od];W[rc];B[rd]LB[nd:A]C[I see that A is joseki. Is this the sole cause of my weakness here or are there other good
lines of play for black?

Black p17 instead of  s16 is a reasonable play. o16, however, is probably best. You give up a small chunk of the right side in exchange for settling the entire w group, giving it no outlet to the center.]
;W[nd]C[I don't like how this corner turns out from here on.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[ne];W[me];B[nf]C[I think b can cut at n16 here, instead.]
;W[ld];B[nb]C[This play doesn't gain b anything, really. Since you're looking to secure moyo a play like n14 would be better.

This would also be a reasonable time to begin a move against w's position as long as you choose a joseki that leaves you in sente.]
;W[mb];B[mc];W[md];B[lb];W[na];B[kd];W[mf]C[I feel as though my group at the top is heavy.

Yes. it is also in danger. A w move to j16, for example, puts heavy pressure on it. Also, your group on the right along the p16-s16 line is not secure. A w invasion at q14 must be responded to. The upshot is that w n14 calls for a response.]
;B[fq]C[It is not unreasonable to make this move if you feel the amount you gain will be greater than the loss in the upper right.]
;W[ng];B[og];W[oh];B[of];W[mh];B[ph]C[You see how w has sente to answer your approach a f3?]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[cj]C[While you will often see players respond with b2 here, w wisely gives up a few points in the corner to take the big point on the side.

Rather than c2, b should consider j3 or j4.];B[gc]C[I like this move reviving the stones at the top.]
;W[ec];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fe];B[he];W[be];B[ej]C[This move seems to float by itself, not really connected to any of your other movements. It does not serve to strengthen your position nor does it do much to prevent w's movement into the area and will have to struggle against the w positions above, below and on the right to live.

Given the character of the double-approach on the upper corner, I would have proceeded with e15.]
;W[dl];B[jq];W[dh];B[eh];W[eg];B[dg];W[ch];B[ef]LB[fg:A]C[I was considering A here and it probably would have been better.]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[gf];B[gg];W[fh];B[ei];W[gh];B[hg];W[ge]C[This sequence appears rushed. Think about what your objectives are in playing. Are you trying to capture w stones? Escape with your stones? You are simply reacting in the heat of battle here and that lets w do as he pleases.]

;B[gd];W[fd]
(;B[ji];W[pq]C[I knew I was going to have to give up quite a bit here. Any suggestions for better play?

One is to look at the previous move. The stones on the left are lost. Your stones on top can probably live without difficulty. What does the capture gain you? Imagine if you had taken this move instead!

But in terms of  responding to this invasion, I think you did fairly well, given your goals.]
;B[qq];W[oq];B[op]C[A play to r2 here might be better. It seals w out of the corner and requires that he live along the side. If w o4, you can press in at n3, making him run into the center to live where you have influence. W will likely live, but you'd probably gain significant territory in the center.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[qr];B[rq];W[mq];B[lp];W[rr];B[mj]C[I would have taken p11 here instead. w would likely fill and then this move seals off the center. As it is, w p11 is actually a threat to you.]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[kq];B[kp];W[jr];B[iq];W[ir];B[hr];W[fn];B[hn]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[go];B[io];W[ke];B[jf]C[This move is highly suspect. What do you care if w connects to his stone at j13? That doesn't threaten the life of your stones.]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[ic];W[id];B[hd];W[kf];B[kg]
C[Again, you are letting w dictate your movements. This move does not gain you anything, the stones still live and the w stone at j13 cannot escape.]
;W[lg];B[li];W[qo]C[Here is a weakness you could have shored up with sente.]

;B[qf];W[re];B[se];W[sc];B[sf]C[You handled that threat well. Notice that w still has sente, however.

Is here a move you could make that would be worth about 10 points? If so, now is the time to make it. Think about it like a ko. Yes, your move at t14 captures the  w stones ... but if there was a ko that would cost you 10 points on the line, would you make this move?]

(;B[fc];W[eb];B[ed]C[This move is pointless. The stones you're using are dead so this is best used as a ko threat.]

C[Better played after you've played g4.];W[fp];B[fm];W[dm];B[is]
;W[kr];B[ka]C[Bad move.

Particularly when you look for where you can gain or secure points here in the endgame. This move actually costs you a point as you should follow-up with j18. Whereas a move like j15 makes you a point. That 2 point differential may seem small here, but it can swing the outcome of a game.]

;B[cs];W[fr];B[ep];W[eo];B[eq];W[mi];B[nj]C[White wins here by 2 points (plus komi). A very close result. I would summarize by saying that you're doing very well at building influence and need not worry about making invasions and such. Your "invasion" of the left (though I wouldn't characterize it as that normally) failed miserably and you *still* came within a few points of winning the game. That tells you that your fundamental strategy is sound. Take a bit more care towards the end of the game in choosing moves and you could easily make big strides in strength.]
