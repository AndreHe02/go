C[Hi, i'm Jeff, and I'll be commenting on your game. I'll put my comments above any that you've made to make it clear where i've mentioned things. I tried to support all my claims with examples, but I am still learning too! So hopefully I can help you to the best of my knowledge and give you some things to work on. If you have any questions or comments (about what I've said), please feel free to email me at wardjm@gmail.com . Keep in mind that there are better moves, and I've just mentioned the best ones to my current ability.

Hi, I'm black playing a ~25k. I'm 30k. Surion didn't want handicap,
so I kinda expected to lose here, although I tried my best.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd];W[jp]
(;B[pj]C[This is an okay move, but it gives your opponent a lot of breathing room. Especially against a stronger opponent, you want to put pressure on. (see variation)]

(;W[jj]C[jeff: I agree, but in this rare case, white does stand to gain from controlling the center.

forbidden: I didn't think this was a good move for white. I'm
always told that you should play at the sides after the corner.]
;B[dj]C[You are still at an advantage here, but white is in good shape to start attacking from his influence in the center.

f0rbidden: So I took the left side.]
(;W[di]C[This is pretty bold. It is not really an approach but an all out invasion. Attaching always makes the stone(s) you attached to stronger, but it also makes the attaching stone stronger. A lone stone attachment is a pretty good option for survival when in an already strong area (which this really isn't that strong). A more elegant invasion is given in the variation.

f0rbidden: I always hear that you shouldn't approach by making
an attachment. Is this move good for white?];B[dg]C[That probably would have been better, but this is good.

f0rbidden: I think I should have played E11 here.];W[ej]
(;B[ei]C[Cross-cutting is a dangerous game.];W[cj]C[f0rbidden: I didn't notice this obvious atari.]

(;B[ci];W[dk]C[Yes.

f0rbidden: Now I've lost the left side.];B[dh];W[dj];B[ch];W[eh]
;B[fh]C[Yes, this comes with time and practice. Just keep playing!

f0rbidden: Again I didn't notice the atari.];W[fi];B[eg];W[ei]
C[Black has forced white into quite bad shape (many stones condensed and yielding small gain and utility).]
;B[cf]TR[dg][eg][ch][dh]C[It is actually a useless move (sorry). The marked stones are so thick that it already should be considered connected to D16.

f0rbidden: Was this connection good?];W[fg];B[ff]C[f0rbidden: Again I didn't notice the atari. Damn.]
;W[gh];B[qn]C[Good, like the one I mentioned earlier, except with more support.

f0rbidden: I tried to make an approach.];W[qm]C[f0rbidden: When I saw this move I thought that it was bad, because
it makes the R7 stone weak. Am I wrong?];B[pm]C[I feel as if this is the best move here. Don't worry too much about killing stones. Just try to keep your opponent separated and good things will happen.

f0rbidden: Respond to attachment with hane. However, I'm kinda
lost if I should play the hane at P7 or S7. I suppose that P7
is more agressive, trying to kill the stone, while at S7 I try
to make territory but allow the stone to run toward the center.]
;W[rn]
(;B[ql]C[No, this was right, just protect yourself before attacking. See variation.

f0rbidden: I think I made my opponent life easier here. I guess
that S7 is much better.];W[rm];B[rl];W[pn];B[qo];W[po];B[ro]
C[f0rbidden: I'm trying to kill his three stones, which have only
2 liberties.];W[pl]C[f0rbidden: Finally I noticed an Atari.]
;B[om];W[ol];B[sm]C[f0rbidden: Killing his stones.];W[nm];B[sn]
C[It was to live.

f0rbidden: I don't know if this move was necessary.];W[on];B[qm]
;W[qp];B[rp];W[rq];B[nl]C[f0rbidden: I guess that this move was really weak. This stone
is obviously going to die.];W[nk];B[ml];W[ok]C[f0rbidden: And now I've helped him make a very good position]
;B[pk];W[mk];B[sq];W[qq];B[pg]C[f0rbidden: Was this move at least ok?]
;W[sr]C[Yes, it can certainly wait until the end of the end game (play sente first, then gote).

f0rbidden: I don't know if this move is good. It looked like
a typical endgame sequence, losing sente.];B[sp];W[rr]
(;B[md]C[Generally, a good rule is to play near the boundaries of both your territories. In theory you can then make moves that are both good to you and bad to your opponent. (Not just only good for you or only bad for him) (see variations)

f0rbidden: Trying to fortify my side. Perhaps too passive?]
;W[mm]C[It's good to just let go of stones that we feel are dead -- it gives you an extra move (at the very least).

f0rbidden: These stones were already dead to me.];B[cq]C[forbidden: the 3-3 invasion. I know I can live there, and I know
it will give a strong position to white. I don't know any other
place to invade though.];W[cp];B[dq];W[ll]C[It was a wasted move.

f0rbidden: Was this move correct? It seems that those stones
were already dead.];B[ep];W[eo];B[fp];W[gp]
(;B[eq]C[Not necessary, see variation.];W[fo];B[do]C[f0rbidden: Very bad cut, I think. After the atari I'm running
toward white stones.];W[co]C[f0rbidden: I then realized I didn't have future with the D5 stone.]
;B[hr]C[G3 is safer and slower, but it depends on your playing style and the score so far. G2 is probably the best.

f0rbidden: I tried to fortify my position. Is G3 better?];W[dn]
;B[gq];W[hp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[hq];B[fr];W[ir];B[is];W[js]
C[f0rbidden: White really likes to play the endgame in the middlegame.
Is this correct? It seems to me it loses sente.];B[hs];W[jr]
;B[hf]C[You made out well in the bottom, and this is a good next move.

f0rbidden: Trying to make territory.];W[hg];B[jg]C[f0rbidden: Trying to make yet more territory.]
;W[ao]C[True. You can actually ignore this move for bigger points. If he pushes at A4, then block. See variation.

f0rbidden: Again an endgame move, and I also think that A4 is
better than A5.]
(;B[ap];W[oj];B[oi];W[ni];B[oh];W[nh];B[mg];W[lg];B[lh]C[M14 is passively protecting your framework. This move is a good attempt to kill that stone.

f0rbidden: I guess that M14 is better];W[mh];B[lf];W[kg];B[kh]
;W[kf]LB[ke:B][jf:A]
(;B[jf]C[Yes, this is essentially where the game is lost. 

f0rbidden: I can believe I missed the ladder!!!!!!!!!! Arghh.
I made a variation for the ladder. Man I got really pissed off
after I realized I had a beautiful ladder and missed it!];W[ke]
;B[kd];W[mf]C[f0rbidden: Now I typically get a double atari after a bad ladder.]
;B[le];W[ng];B[nf];W[me];B[ld];W[ne];B[of];W[jh]C[f0rbidden: My stones at L-M12 are dead.]
;B[ig];W[ih]
(;B[je]C[No, this was quite good. See variation.

f0rbidden: Hoping he will miss the connection. Lousy play, I
know.];W[mg];B[nd];W[ki]LB[aa:B][oe:A]C[I agree.

f0rbidden: White really likes to keep beating the dead horse.]

(;B[oe]C[Not necessary to stop an invasion, but it saves a lot of points as you saw in your variation.

f0rbidden: I guess this wasn't necessary. Am I right? I feared
P15.];W[gf];B[ge];W[gg];B[ee];W[he]C[Simple play where white did. Usually a move that is good for your opponent is good enough for you to just play there and take that move away.

f0rbidden: I thought that this cut was bad, but I didn't know
how to defend it.]
(;B[if]LB[hd:A]
(;W[hd]C[f0rbidden: Now white has 4 liberties.];B[gd];W[hc]

(;B[hb]C[In most cases this "jumping in front of a long line of white stones" move will get you into more trouble.]
;W[gc];B[gb];W[fc];B[fd];W[ec];B[ic];W[ed];B[fe];W[dc]C[f0rbidden [?\]: yeah, lots of sun]
;B[cc]C[Yes, be weary of the double atari.

f0rbidden: I suppose this move was very weak.];W[de]C[f0rbidden: double atari again, damn...]
;B[ef];W[cd]C[f0rbidden: I guess that now white lives no matter what.]

surion [17k\]: =)

surion [17k\]: yes but me too];W[ce];B[bf];W[fb]C[f0rbidden [?\]: yeah, but look at the board, you have a LOT of
space];B[df];W[dd];B[fa]C[f0rbidden: Typical endgame sequence. I guess I had a better move
somewhere else.];W[ea]LB[db:B];B[ga];W[db];B[ib]C[I don't think there is much difference. Protecting here was good though.

f0rbidden: I guess K18 is better. I was making the moves too
fast :(.];W[id]LB[jc:A][as:B]
(;B[jc]C[f0rbidden: I don't know if this was necessary. See variation.]
;W[og];B[ph];W[bj];B[bi];W[ai];B[aj]C[f0rbidden: Self-atari is the end of the world. It's like a slap
in the face. Arghh. Making moves too fast again.];W[ak];B[ah]
C[f0rbidden: I have no idea if I can live here. My guess is NO.]
;W[ag]

f0rbidden: Is A10 better?];W[bg]C[f0rbidden: Now I'm completely dead.]
;B[aj]C[f0rbidden: Tried to make a ko fighting to desesperately live. Although I'm dead,I ended up living.
I guess that If a group is dead, move along, so I think that this wasnt a good move.]

See variation]

spaces, make to eyes by playing in the center!];B[bg]C[f0rbidden: Back from the dead!!!]
;W[aj];B[qc]C[True.

f0rbidden: I guess a 3-3 invasion was possible, so I tried to
fortify my position.];W[hi]C[No, it is a wasted move.

end playing in a dame zone, doing absolutely nothing.];W[tt]

You just lost a few fights and that one ladder that allowed white to get the upper left corner. I've pointed out some mistakes and hopefully commented on things you should work on. I think focusing on what I've said and what you've said will lead to the most rapid improvement. Good luck!

f0rbidden: I've lost badly, even getting luck by making life
of a dead group. I guess that I need to keep a special attention at atari, always try to read in contact fighting at least 3 moves
and keep an eye for ladders and nets! I didn't know if a invasion
was possible for white really big space. I also don't know why I lost so badly. I'd love some advice!]
