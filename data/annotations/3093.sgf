;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dq];B[qi];W[cj]C[is this playable? if it is, what is the purpouse?

This is one of several standard openings; it loosely claims the left side, as black's stones have loosely claimed the right side.]
;B[co]C[i play here inmediately because if white close here it will be very profitable with his c10 stone.

I think this is acceptable but I more often see an approach from the outside, where your stones will not be as squeezed; say G3. Another option is to continue building a large framework and dare W to invade; say K17.]
;W[fq]C[i dont feel this is right. what about g3 or better yet at f4 or e4 to put pressure at black c5 and get some nice influence with his c10 stone.

This is probably too timid; g3 looks better. I don't like f4 particularly, since it doesn't put much pressure on B and leaves what is called an open skirt on the right. I actually like c7 best, since it makes a nice extension from c10 and squeezes c5 a lot.]
;B[cl]C[This is a nice extension];W[ej];B[bq]C[to settle.

fine.];W[cr]C[i think this is not necessary. i think white 12 will be better placed at k16 and work at his moyo.

Agreed. W is being timid, and his stones are over concentrated.]
;B[jq]C[i think it was better to play at k16 to negate white moyo and establish mine, but i play here to put pressure at the 3 white stones at the bottom and at the same time work at my outside influence.

I likd k16 better also, although this is not a bad move. The 3 white stones are quite strong and can easily make life, so it doesn't make too much sense to pressure them.]
;W[ir]C[This move is too low and these stones do not need help.]
;B[jd]C[capturing a side star point, work at my influence and stop white development.

good.];W[lq];B[nq]C[i didnt mind sacrificing my black k3 for securing the territory at the bottom right. i thought too that maybe k3 will help me at the long run.]
;W[lo];B[qo];W[jo];B[fc]C[continuing my advance.];W[cf];B[db]
C[i was thinking at the moment that it was better at q8 because i felt that by white playing at this area he will get influence while reducing.

I like this better than q8];W[cc];B[pe]C[this came automatically, something i read of kato masao that one shouldnt take too long to close this area when playing the chinese fuseki.]
;W[pl]C[see what i mean? i felt frustated but i rationalize that is not possible to play in different places with one move.]
;B[oi]C[attacking while establishing a big area.];W[rk]C[i dont know about this. maybe it was better to try to invade or reduce the top right.

I don't like this move; it is hard to establish a base here. I think s8 is better, or else o8 or n8. Another option might be an invasion of your top territory.]
;B[jg]C[closing.

I think that n16 is better, as it makes your top very resistant to invasion.]
;W[he];B[hc];W[jj];B[lh];W[lj];B[eo]C[trying to get in at white potential territory.]
;W[go];B[hg];W[fe]C[At this point I think B is ahead but should protect his top.]
;B[fg];W[eg];B[fi];W[el];B[hj];W[hl];B[dk];W[dj];B[ek];W[fk]
;B[fj];W[gk];B[dl]C[This empty triangle is ugly and strengthens W. Better is B8, and I still think the top needs to be protected.]
;W[em];B[ef];W[df];B[eh];W[dg];B[ee];W[ed];B[ff];W[fd];B[nk]
;W[nl];B[mk];W[mi];B[mh];W[lc]C[here we go. i think white waited too long for this. even so i handle this with care.

A proverb:

When trying to make life, play in contact with your enemies stones.

I think W's best move is probably Q18, forcing B to block either the top or the corner, and then attempting to make life on the side not blocked. I agree that an earlier invasion would have been wise. I think W should be able to make life here.]
;B[kb];W[oc];B[ob];W[nc]C[I don't like this move by W. To make life in this sort of situation, you must sacrifice some stones. A cross cut at Q18 or a wedge at Q16 would be better, I think. Other thoughts are R17 and O18 and L17.]

;W[ni];B[jh];W[oj];B[pi];W[ll]C[At this point W could resign]
;B[ik];W[il];B[jk];W[lk];B[rm]C[big point, i thought, but now im looking at the bottom left and im feeling quite vulnerable. what do u think?

I think the bottom left is salvagable, but that c9 is sente and should be played first. If you had played b8 instead of d8 earlier, this wouldn't be an issue.]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[ri];B[rh];W[qj];B[qg]C[since you have n8 followed by m17 as a way to live, this move isn't needed.]
