C[Olawi: This is OK, I suppose, just seems a little misguided: white can now play at A and be happy. Moves B through E would seem more active.]
;W[jq]LB[jp:A]C[This is good, it prevents a black extension and is good developement from the star-point. This could also be at A.]
;B[cf]LB[jd:A][fc:B]C[Approaching from this side will make the game a fighting one. I personally would prefer a more peaceful opening and play at A or B.]
;W[ce]LB[dj:A]C[This is wrong. White should play this only if he has backup around A. At this situation he only makes black stronger.]
;B[df]C[The only move.];W[fd];B[cj]LB[dj:A]C[This is correct. Could also be at A.]
;W[cl]C[White is threatening to invade. I think that the results of the invasion at A would not be too disasterous for black, so he could just as well tenuki (play elsewhere.)]
;B[jd]MA[pd]C[This goes nicely with the marked stone. Black is now developing rapidly.]

(;W[qi]LB[qf:A]C[White would be better off approaching at A. Here he of course makes a strong group at the right side, but black should gain territory from either side in the process. See variations for second thoughts :) This is OK.]

(;B[qf]LB[qg:A][qk:B]C[This should be at A or B. See variations for possible continuations.  The move at R14 does not threaten the white stone effectively enough, and yet it fails to secure the corner.]
;W[ql]LB[cq:A]C[White is secure, for the time being. At this stage the game seems to be quite even. Black has some territory in the lower right corner and white has a secure group splitting up the right side. Otherwise, the territories of neither side are not secure, so it is the time for black to invade the lower left. I personally would prefer A, but I am sure that some players would argue that this gives white too much influence. See the variation and decide for yourself.]

(;B[gq]C[This is quite loose, but should live easily. The lower left corner is still open and should be invaded in the near future.]
;W[mq]C[This is good, white plays safe. Also begins to threaten the lower right corner.]
;B[cn]LB[cq:A]MA[jq][mq]TR[cf][df][cj]C[This is over-aggressive. I would recommend invading the corner at A instead. The reasoning is that 1) black can expect to have sente after the invasion 2) the marked white stones are strong, so black should not seek quarrel here and 3) the marked black group is still open to invasion, so this will probably turn into a mess.]
;W[eq]LB[el:A][eo:B]C[This is weird, white should simply jump to A. The corner cannot easily be killed, and this does not even help much against that either. The other sensible move would be splitting the black stones with a play around B.]
;B[go]LB[en:A]MA[gq]C[This does not threaten much of anything, just moves the black stones out. The problem is that maybe the marked stone was not yet in too much trouble, black should have played A instead.]
;W[cp]LB[en:A]C[Rescues the corner, leaves black out of trouble. Black should definitely play A now.]
;B[en]MA[cl]C[This is very good. The marked white stone now has to run or else black gets too much territory in the left side. When chasing the running white group, black can expect to gain an advantage.]
;W[el]LB[bn:A][bl:B]C[White runs. Remember that he is now able to connect underneath at A. Black can also connect at B if he wishes.]
;B[gl]C[Black should be able to solidify both of his groups by chasing the white one in between.]
;W[nc]LB[ej:A]C[This is a bit strange. Black should ignore this and capture some of the white stones with A. There is nothing too serious that is going to happen in the upper side. See variation.]

(;B[oc]LB[pb:A]MA[jd]C[Black is expecting the sequence shown in the variation. I feel that the move at A is better, it does not leave white too much room to manouver, secures the corner (this move does not) and the marked black stone still stays out of trouble.]

(;W[jc]C[White is trying some sort of sabaki here. Should work.]
;B[kc];W[ic];B[ld]C[This result is quite good for black.];W[nd]
LB[of:A]C[This is too heavy, white should pe punished. 'A' should do it.]
;B[mf]C[Ma8e: had this move been better placed at o14 or somewhere else?
Olawi: o14 is fine, but this is not bad either. I probably would have played P14. The purpose of these moves is of course not to kill white, but chase it around while making territory and strength for black.]
;W[oo]LB[pn:A]C[Ma8e: Not doing this move myself was my biggest mistake as far as I can see.
Olawi: not quite, this of course has to be answered, but it is not too big to be the only good move on the board. black should now play A.]
;B[om]LB[pn:A]C[Ma8e: now it is not easy for me to cut. Could I have done it in a better way?
Olawi: This is over-aggressive and it does not cut the white groups either. A play at A would have been better, in my opinion.]
;W[pn]C[White obviously cuts through.];B[pm];W[qn];B[qm];W[rm]
LB[rn:A]C[Play at A. See variations.]
(;B[ro];W[rn];B[np]LB[ok:A]MA[om][pm][qm]C[Black abandons the marked stones and does not threaten either of the white groups. not good. Black should seek safety with A or similar.]
;W[op]C[White is able to cut.];B[oq];W[nq];B[no];W[nn];B[mo]
C[Black is in bad shape. Rescuing these stones could be a bad idea. The corner is almost dead or dead.]
;W[on];B[ok];W[pk];B[ln]C[Black now has two weak groups to look after, and should be in trouble. Locally though, this move is okay.]
;W[lp];B[kp]LB[lk:A]C[This does not accomplish anything. Black should try to connect his groups with A.]
;W[kq];B[jp];W[ip]C[Black gets bad shape while white gains territory.]
;B[jn];W[ko];B[jo];W[lo];B[mn];W[nm]LB[kn:A]C[And now white splits black, from here or with A.]
;B[ol]LB[kn:A]C[Why rescue useless stones? These could be sacrificed and black should connect at A instead.]
;W[kn];B[ll];W[jm];B[in]LB[ho:A]C[Bad shape again. Black's play has been quite hopeless here, he has too many weak and heavy groups of stones. A would be better.]
;W[km];B[lm]LB[ml:A]C[A is better because it does something to connect the two black groups in the center.]
;W[bn]C[This is tesuji, white is able to connect.];B[bm]TR[cl]
[el]MA[bn][cp][dp][eq]C[Ma8e: why do I not succeed in keeping these groups apart?
Olawi: Because it is impossible, white is able to connect.]
;W[cm];B[bo];W[dn];B[co];W[do];B[bl];W[bp];B[an];W[em]C[This is not terrible for black. Now he had better look after the groups in the center.]
;B[nl]LB[lj:A]C[A is better, because it begins to map some territory in the center.]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[jk]MA[nc][nd]C[White splits black. Now black has 2 groups that are in dire straits. The situation is not too bad, however. If black captures the marked stones and is able to live with his clumps in the center, he still has a game.]
;B[gj];W[ej]C[The problem is that white is able to reduce black's territory while attacking.]
;B[ir]C[With this, black gets one eye in the bottom. Should probably be left as it is after white replies and treated as a kikashi (forcing move)]
;W[iq]C[Now Black should play elsewhere.];B[jr];W[kr];B[hq]
;W[pe]C[White is trying something here. As I said, black should capture these stones if he wishes to be in the game. It could be impossible though..]
;B[pf];W[nf];B[oh]LB[ng:A]C[Hane at A? This situation is rather complicated so I better had not say anything definitive.]
;W[me];B[lf]C[Now it seems that white will be able to break out or live in the corner.]
;W[od];B[qd];W[pc];B[ob]C[This is good, remember the proverb: "If you have a stone in the third line, add one and then abandon both." By sacrificing one more stone, you make worse eye-shape for white.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[nb];B[qb];W[oa]LB[lb:A]C[If black plays at A, white still has only one eye. After this, he will have to try to escape, but this should be hard if not impossible.]

(;B[oe]C[Useless, there was no eye here in the first place. See variations.]
;W[ne]LB[ng:A][lb:B]C[If black plays A, white is captured and has to make life with B. If black plays B, white has to try to escape with A.]
;B[of]C[Why save this stone? It is useless. White now pushes through and splits black.]
;W[ng];B[li]C[An attempt to connect the black groups and shut white in. This seems a bit weak, but should work.]
;W[im]LB[lb:A]C[At any time from here on: Killing white with A is the biggest move.]
;B[hm];W[lj];B[mj];W[lk];B[mk];W[jj];B[jl]C[This is useless and achieves nothing.]
;W[kl];B[il];W[ik];B[hl];W[ki];B[lh];W[he]LB[lb:A]C[Now white is ahead in territory and needs not attack black anymore. The lower left corner is almost dead and black cannot attack any of the white groups effectively. Game over? Not if black kills white at the top.. so white should have played at A. It seems that both players missed this?]
;B[hh]LB[fr:A]C[Black can always save this group starting with A.]
;W[kh];B[kg];W[ih];B[ig];W[jh];B[jg];W[ii];B[pj];W[qj];B[rk]
;W[qk];B[rh]LB[ri:A]C[White should play A now or start killing the corner straight away.]

Olawi: You were not as strong or connected as you thought. The main problems for you in this game it seems were: 1) Not capturing some of your opponents very weak groups when you had the chance. 2) Developing too many weak groups for yourself, thus ruining your potential territory when you had to save them.

Both players made a lot of wasted moves and there were a lot of good opportunities for you, as indicated in the comments, of which you took no adgantage of.   I hope that these comments are of some help. Remember though that I'm only 6k* IGS, so my comments could be misleading or plain wrong at times. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to mail me.
