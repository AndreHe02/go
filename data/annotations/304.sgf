;W[ip];B[jn]C[b's K6 is light and good.];W[mp]C[As for w's N4, L4 or H6 is  recommended.]

(;B[lp]C[b's M4 is very heavy against the lightness of K6.  One move back, and cf var2.]

;B[ci];W[bi];B[bj];W[bk];B[bh]C[Here w can cut at G7.
b's B12 seems greedy to me.
Let's try a variation.]
(;W[aj];B[dh];W[el];B[fl]C[F8 should be F5.];W[gm];B[hm]C[H7 also should be F5.]

(;W[gl]C[w's G8 is very heavy.
One move back, and see var2.];B[hl];W[gk];B[fk];W[hj];B[jl];W[ln];B[lm]
;W[mn];B[nn];W[er]C[B3 and N7 is urgent point for b.];B[pi]C[b should move at B3.]

;W[pl]C[O16 is attractive than Q8 for w.];B[om]C[So b should move at O16. And  P7 is very heavy.]
;W[qn];B[kd]C[Both player forgot the vital point B3?];W[mc]C[Center is important now, so N16 is better than N17.]
;B[oq]C[Again, center is important now.
b should move at N15.];W[pq];B[op];W[oo]C[P2 is better than P5 for w.];B
[no]C[O2 is better than O5  for b.];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq]C[From P3 nozoki till now, b got nothing,  rather losing a little.

From now w moved at S15 and b moved at R17. And the battle ended up to b's  big lost there.

Center is more important now than upper right corner.
Next moves are my variation. But I failed to modify and delete a variation,  and I could'nt recover the original.
I have to be better at using Winmgt. Sorry for my failure.

Please enjoy next moves.

Generally speaking, both players like battling very much.
But I think many of the battles are unnecessary. If you both learn more  fuseki,or balance, you will make progress a lot.

Thank you for your request of my reviewing.];W[le];B[ld];W[md];B[me];W[lf]
