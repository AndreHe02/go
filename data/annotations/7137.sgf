C[Hi, thanks for reviewing my game. I take white in this game, in which I probably do plenty of lousy moves, but am especially interested in three parts: black's rightside invasion, the way to use the thickness gained from shutting him in, and finally how to answer black's invasion/reduction in the central framework.

DanielTom (reviewer) - Hello! I'm 2d on KGS so I'm not really strong but I'm going to try to help you. Let's take a look at the game. In the end of the game record you can find what I think are your main weaknesses and how to improve from here.]

(;B[cd]C[DT - I added some variations here to show you the most basic openings and to talk a bit about them so you can choose what you find most pleasant. Probably you already know (most) of them but it's always nice to review this basics. Studying Fuseki (opening) is always a sure way to improve.]
;W[pp];B[pc];W[dq]
(;B[mq]LB[qe:A][qn:B][co:C]C[DT - This is the wrong direction and a bit greedy. Black didn't like the idea of you having the bottom all for youself.
A B and C would be the normal directions of play (see variations).]

(;W[pn]LB[oq:A]C[DT - I would take the the corner with A but there many other options - see variations.]
;B[pr]
(;W[qq]LB[pq:A]C[DT - A instead is better, I think.];B[qr]
(;W[oq]LB[qj:A]C[this was a bad move?

DT - It's not bad, you're making Black walk in the 2nd line (witch is always bad so early in the game) but i would play at A directly.]
;B[or];W[pe];B[mc]C[Here I felt that the following moves gave black an easy time invading,]

(;W[og]LB[qi:A]C[DT - Yes, this move is not really good. A move around A would be much better.]
;B[qd];W[qe];B[pj]C[DT - Black did well here.]
(;W[nj]C[DT - This was a good move.];B[qm];W[pm];B[qn];W[qo]

;W[pg];B[oh];W[nh];B[oi];W[oj];B[pi]C[I left the cut at O13 unprotected, since I didn't think the R14 group was in danger, and thought that there isn't much territory to be gained even if I connect]
;W[kq]LB[ng:B][om:A]C[is c5 better, since the black group is pretty safe anyway?

DT - Here you need to be careful with A and B cutting points.]
;B[lq]C[DT - This move is bad for Black, it only makes White stronger.]
;W[kp];B[rq];W[rp];B[pq]LB[dq:A]C[now the c3 stone seems a wasted move

DT - I don't see the c3 stone :( If you mean A then no, it's not waisted.]
;W[qp];B[sq];W[rn];B[rm]
(;W[ok]LB[nm:A]C[DT - This is too slow. If you want to fix yur shape locally A would be better.]
;B[op]
(;W[dn]LB[dg:A]C[DT - This is a good point but I think you could have done better. See A variation please.]
;B[ck]C[DT - This move is too deep.]
(;W[cm]TR[nh][ni][nj][oj][ok][ol]C[DT - This was a bad move globally. You didn't pay attention to the whole board. This is a very important lesson: if you have thickness, you must use it! ATTACK! Drive your opponent's weak stones towards your thickness (the marked way). Please see variation.]
;B[ch]TR[nh][ni][nj][oj][ok][ol]C[DT - Black has a solid position and it's now hard to use the marked wall.]
;W[ec]LB[fc:A]C[DT - Usually to avoid fight (a pincer) White plays at A but here it's not too risky because you have thickness in the center.]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[df]C[DT - Black was a bit soft here I think. Maybe it's just a matter of style.]
;W[hc]LB[ic:A]C[J17 much better?
DT - Yes, A is the normal shape.];B[jc];W[db];B[cb];W[dd];B[cc]

(;W[ek]LB[hc:B][ek:D][jm:C][oo:A]C[this seems too greedy, as it doesn't threaten the left side, would something like G4 or G5 be better?

DT - This move was OK. But don't forget Black's painful move at A and the B group.  
Personally, I would play C instead of D.];B[gq]C[DT - This is way too deep. You should try to kill this group.]

(;W[hp]LB[ho:A]C[DT - A looks better.];B[hq];W[ip];B[er];W[dr]

DT - A was not necessary, Black should have died :(];W[mo];B[no]
;W[nn];B[np];W[mn]C[I felt W100 was necessary to keep black from breaking through, but the next move ruined my territory prospects]
;B[jj]LB[ec:B][di:A]C[Now what to do? I felt the black stone invaded too deep, but I could't find a way to attack it, while securing territory. What would be the best way to attack?

DT - Yes, this is too deep! Your move in the game was OK but you could also start by playing some forcing moves like A.
The problem is that your B group is not really strong...]
(;W[ih]C[I thought that my only chance was to kill the invasion, but that is unreasonable?

[fq:A]C[Black has pretty thin positions, but I could'nt find severe invasion or cut possibilities other than the gote ones I played. Any suggestions?

DT - Black is leading now by a lot, so game over now. As I showed you before, you could have killed A and B. See the end of the game record for a list of advices.]

DT - I think that your main problems are strategy and reading.
If your reading was better you could have killed the marked groups - A and B. 
As you know, thickness shouldn't be used to make territory. So next time, when you have a wall (C) and you opponent invades (D) use your wall to attack it.
Your main mistake was move E. 
In order to improve your reading, you should do many life and death go problems. Remember: "Focus on solving many easy problems fast - better than working on very difficult ones. It's in simple situations where most mistakes occur during real games."
I advice you to use the Chinese Opening (pros think it's the best opening for your level). And have fun!
I hope this review was helpful. I wish you all the luck in the world. 
Bye bye ^_^])
