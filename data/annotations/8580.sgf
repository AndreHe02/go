C[Hello and thank you for reviewing my game!

Please dont hold back on sharing where my main current weaknesses are.]

;B[do]C[This move is bad, so you should probably extend to B6]
(;W[bp];B[nq]C[Here you might want to pincer as you are strong on the low side]
(;W[oq];B[np];W[pn];B[jq]
(;W[qj]C[This Jump, i am not too sure if its too far out or not from the bottom corner?

The low right corner ist not save yet, so you should either play save on R8 or go the whole way to R14]
(;B[qh];W[cf]C[Playing tenuki here is an overplay. R8 really hurts now. On the other hand playing there again to fix the weakness feels like a wasted or a small move. So R10 must have been not so good.]
;B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[ck]
(;W[cn]C[This move in hind-sight looks too small somewhere along the top probably would have been better.

Agreed. If you want to play there, play C7. But right now there is no need.]
;B[cm]
(;W[bm]C[why here?
What is your plan? If this is a reduceing move it is way too early. If you want to hunt a group it is not strong enough. Again i suggest tenuki to the top side, but if u want to play locally, seperate the groups.]
;B[dn];W[bk]C[This is not a good trade for W. W connects two living groups, making roughly 5-7 Points. Black gets a strong Wall to the center. In this stage of the game this is horrible for W.]
;B[bn];W[an];B[bl];W[cn];B[bj];W[bi];B[ak]C[The outcome is even worse then thought. Not only did the (un-needed) connection fail but also the Black stones are now strong and practically alive.]
;W[bn]C[A wasted move. 1. It is a KO. 2. It is max 5 Points and is not involved in live and death of a group.]

(;W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc]C[Here you were to passive. Hane on R15 is a bitter mistake made by B if there is a stone on O17.]
(;W[jc]TR[oi][ej][nn]C[A wasted move at this stage?

maybe some of the marked moves would have been better?
E10 and P11 can be cut with more profit for B. For sure K17 has to run for its live so you should create an attraktive area it can run to.Maybe E11 or F11 + following and then invade.
On the other hand there is still quite some space in the center so they might create live there.]
;B[id];W[oi]C[tenuki? Are you sure P11 is sente?];B[pi];W[pj]
;B[oj];W[qi];B[ph];W[ok];B[nj];W[nk];B[mj]
(;W[ef]C[Ok, so you came out sente from P11 but E14 is not sente. Black should kill K17 now. If he does, W is in real trouble. The Black area on the upper right side is very big. White only has a small corner in the upper right and the two low corners. But the left one can be reduced with G2 and the right one can be invaded in several ways.]
;B[nh]C[This is just bad....];W[ei]C[Is this move a little slow?
Hm, I think it is ok. It settels your group to corfortable live. It reduces the influence of the gib black groub on the low left side.]

Ofcourse you should play a KO here. You can't lose anything playing it and it is worth quite some points. Who ever wins the KO, you get out with profit.]

;B[mi];W[df];B[de];W[lj]C[Thank you for your review :)

The game was done after W could secure it's territory. Black wasted some moves what did lead to a serious reduction of his own territory.

what you should work on:
Try to read a bit deeper. I know this is probably what everbody get to hear, but it is true. Try to read a position when you are not sure wether you should play save or extend (see opening in the low left corner).
Try to work on shapes. Playing open triangles and such often create weaknesses in your groups
Work on your invasions. That one stone on the upper side felt kinda lost. Luckyly you could save it, but dont count on bad oponents.
I hope I could help you and maybe give some new idears.])
