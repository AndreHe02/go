Hi Markus,

my name is Anna ^-^.
Hope my comments will help you to improve your game.

You:
How I could I have gotten more territory in the center?

=> You should better concentrate on getting more territory in the corners.
Getting territory in the center is more difficult because you need much
more stones to secure your territory (in comparison to the corners).

You:
How could I have prevented the invasion of W at the top (beginning
at move 102)?

=> You missed some simple moves (have a look on my comment at move 60 and 101)

;W[fo];B[cq]C[My goal was making a base to live in that corner. But after W's hane at C2 (next move) I had no idea how to survive?! So So I doubt this move was correct. Is there a move to make my group live? :)]

     black will be surely dead.];W[dr];B[eq];W[ep];B[dk]C[I tried to get some influence and to help developing the left side in exchange for the four black stones in the corner. :S

a look on the triangled marked stones (see the next variation)!
