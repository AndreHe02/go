C[ysysys2015 [6k\]: hello
adomasu [7k\]: hi have a nice game

J: Hi My name is Jay and I will be reviewing you game. My comments will start with "J:"]
;B[pd]C[Hello dear reviewer,

Thank you very much for reviewing my game.
I played this as black on KGS and lost pretty badly although my opponent didn't have komi. The reason I'm sending this game in is that there were a few sequences where I felt my approach to the situation was wrong but don't know what the correct would be. (where by approach I mean the possible outcomes I should try to achieve with my moves choosing them accordingly)
In particular I think I really messed up the bottom in this game. At some point towards the endgame (when I had long lost but didn't resign because I can't count) one of my groups died, so there is no reason to review the game past that point, and arguably many moves before that blunder by me, as the situation was hopeless.
In your comments and variations please try to focus on the general ideas and goals that are attached to the moves rather than complicated fighting variations, unless the situations leading to those fights occur often (for example from joseki). Also please try to correct my thoughts about the moves I played and tell me as often as possible if my assessment of certain positions and moves is correct or not. I hope you find the game interesting and not too difficult to review :)]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[ip]C[Not very used to seeing this move. I do know that the most common move is double approach, but I'm not familiar with the joseki and taking the corner also seems to be played often.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[joseki.

J: normal so far.];W[nq]C[This position has occured in pro games where black played either my move or r6. I assume I got too jealous of white's bottom here, which was a dominant theme in this game. In the end white got all of it, even though I tried to reduce it from all sides. I tend to underestimate the aji of f3 in this position, especially since players at this level will never let it connect to the corner and insist on killing it on a large scale leading to a fight that I can't figure out.

J: The aji at F3 needs a strong left side to pull out.];B[pn]
;W[pr];B[mq]TR[ip][nq]C[Bad move by me. Too jealous of white's bottom. I thought I could live there and white's thickness wouldn't be usefull in that situation, however white isn't going to let me do that. And he doesn't play the joseki move, probably correctly.

J: Right simply playing R3 is enough. White's extension is a bit awkward.]
;W[np]C[I don't know what to do here. It's a very bad position for black, I think.

J: R3 is still a good idea here. White will turn at N4 to kill the N3 stone. then an extension down the right side is ok. See variation.]

(;B[fr]C[I play this probe. No idea what timing this should be, probably not now though. Maybe just playing some big moves in the empty parts would be best here.

J: Definately too early to play in this area. R3 is urgent.]
;W[es]C[this is what a 6k will play 100% of the time in such a position. I'm not sure what the difference to f1 is. Also I'm not sure how dangerous this is for my corner.
In any case, now I'm hoping to either run out while attacking white or living on the bottom.

J: The difference between E1 and F1 is that F1 reduces a black liberty. The corner is safe for now.

J: It's still possible to go back to R3. F2 makes black C7 almost sente to attack white.]
;B[fo]C[J: It's still too early to play in this area. Black is making a weak group. See variation.]
;W[dn]
(;B[dm]C[this is a blunder. I misread the cuts that white has. However I assume that if I answered correctly, white would attempt and probably succeed in killing everything there and having half the board as territory.

J: It's difficult to recover from this.];W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[bp]
;W[cm];B[em]TR[fn][fp]C[still hoping to get an attack if white doesn't respond.

J: It's difficult since black has cutting points around F4 and F6.]
;W[lo]C[Now white apparantly has a huge bottom. I kept looking for ways to reduce it but couldn't find any.]
;B[iq]C[J: The bottom side is still small. White wouldn't spend an opening move to seal J2.

J: Black can thank about a move like D9/D10 to keep white low on the left side and build influence. White getting D9 is more painful.]
;W[gp]C[No idea about all of this...

J: White is fixing black's cutting points.];B[fp];W[hq]
(;B[qq]TR[lo][gp][ip][hq][pr][np][nq]C[Aiming at O2 without a clear followup, basically hoping this is sente.

J: Now that white spent 7 moves to seal the bottom side, it's ok to let white have it. Black can still reduce around H1 in the endgame.

J: C9/D9 is now urgent for both sides. See variations.]
(;W[qr];B[qj]C[and now I tenuki. In this kind of shape I always get invaded though and never get a good result.

J: In that case, R9 is also acceptable.];W[hr]C[J: H2 is a nice dual purpose move to threaten connection at F1 and seal the bottom side. But now, it's too small. White should play D9 to buikd the left side while attacking black.]

(;B[jp]C[still looking for something on the bottom.

J: Bottom is definately too small now. D9 is urgent and sente to force white to connect at F1. See Variation.]
;W[jo];B[io];W[hp];B[gn]C[fixing the cut. Not sure if white could have tried that earlier.]
;W[jn];B[nr];W[or];B[mr];W[oq]C[J: All of these trades, without intend is loss of ko threats at best, loss of points at worst.]
;B[cj]C[trying to get sente moves against white there, strengthen my center group and get something on the side.

J: C10 is the correct idea.];W[cl];B[dk];W[fs];B[cf];W[ce]C[bad move by white. Gives me good shape.]
;B[df];W[fc];B[nc]
(;W[qd]C[In this kind of position, I have absolutely no idea what the differences are between R16, S16 and S15. Also when to play R17 assuming the ko situation is favourable (which here it probably isn't for white).

J: White's attachment is usually played at S16 or S15. See variations.

J: Black here should only consider R15 or R17. See variations.]

(;B[qe]
(;W[pe]C[unusual move. I don't know any of the joseki here though, let alone how R10 affects my choices.

J: cut is unreasonable.]
(;B[qc]C[J: The proverb is "Extend from a crosscut." When black atari's white, black is only making white stronger.

J: The simplest response here is just to extend to Q17. SEe variation.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[od];B[pc];W[oc];B[oe]
(;W[nd];B[pf];W[mc]C[J: even though white captured O17 the result is ok for both sides.]
;B[nb]C[Trying to get some sente moves on the outside.

J: In this particular case, this looks like a local loss of points.]
;W[ob];B[ne];W[ld]C[J: O15 is pushing white from behind.]
(;B[jd]C[again too jealous. Too early to reduce the top.

J: A reduction now is ok, but K16 is slack. F15 and G16 are possible. See variations.]
;W[me]C[big move.];B[mf];W[lf];B[mg];W[pl]C[and here is, after my messup at the bottom, the second sequence that I'm very curious about what I should try to do and how]
;B[ql]C[trying to take territory.];W[qk]
(;B[rk]C[J: black needs to worry about the life of the corner. R7 is much safer.]
;W[qm]C[this seems like an overplay.

J: No, this is the correct direction. White sacrifices R9 to put pressure on black's bottom right corner.]
;B[pk];W[pm]C[white is trying to kill the corner.];B[nn]C[I run.]
;W[nl];B[mo]C[not sure why I played this. Thought it improved my shape but maybe that's a good ko threat.]
;W[mp];B[qn]C[Slow move but I knew white would certainly respond.]
;W[rm];B[nm]C[bad move by me. Not sure how to proceed though, My corner needs to run and at the same time I need to keep some of the right side. Killing white is probably not going to happen.

J: Yes. White can extend to N8 because the P8 cut doesn't work. See variation.]

(;W[ok];B[ml]
(;W[mk];B[ll];W[lk]C[J: white can ask Q10 first.];B[nj];W[nk]
;B[om];W[ol]
(;B[kk]C[I should have played P5 instead here but thought that's not enaugh...

J: L8 is stronger. white is pushing from behind. See variation.]
;W[oo]C[I read the sequence where I respond at P6 in the variation and decided that this is really bad and I need to possibly give up the corner (which would mean the game is over).

J: Your sequence has mistakes, see variation.]
(;B[no]C[Not sure this is a good move. But my idea was to play M6 and hope for the best...]
;W[op];B[ln]C[I think white should just cut here. There isn't much I can do.

J: Yes, white should cut.]
(;W[kp]C[White responded though, maybe giving me a chance to get back into this game...]
;B[on];W[kl];B[km]
(;W[kj]C[bad move I think. White could maybe extend, especially after his slow move on the bottom. Even if that doesn't work, there should be better alternatives. I'm not sure how far ahead white is in terms of points here.

J: white can't extend. There will be too many cutting points.]
;B[jl];W[li];B[mj]C[J: black should turn at M13 immediately to keep attack on white.]
;W[oj]
(;B[nh]C[J: K10 is another idea. See variation.];W[lj];B[oi]
;W[pj];B[pi];W[qk]C[I decide that this is not big enaugh and tenuki.

J: good idea.];B[jj]C[trying to build the center threatening to resume the attack]
;W[rl]
(;B[lg]C[I once again ignore that part. My move is bad though. It helps white's shape and doesn't do anything.

J: Yes, now that white is alive, M13 is no longer an attack, so white can respond at L14. Simply F15 is enough. See variation.]
;W[kf];B[ie];W[ji]C[J: K11 is large.];B[ii];W[ij];B[jk];W[ih]
;B[hi];W[jh];B[hh]C[I read here that I can connect those stones.]
;W[hg];B[ge];W[gg];B[ff];W[fi]C[and completely misread the cut at J13

J: Mutual destruction, white doesn't get the top, black doesn't get the center.]
;B[ig]C[J: blunder.];W[if];B[jg];W[kg];B[hf];W[jf];B[gh]C[J: G12 is vulgar.]
;W[fh];B[gj];W[fg];B[cc]C[I decide it's time to play this now.]
;W[dc];B[be];W[cd]TR[jd][jp][iq][mq]C[J: b16 is better endgame for white.

J: This is my last comment. I think the main take-aways for black in this game is to not be too jealous of white's potential as long as you can build something even bigger. 

J: You should also alway mind cutting points. Playing more solidly during fights may not kill your opponent, but it's much easier to gain other benefits elsewhere that way.]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[gc];W[gb];B[fb];W[eb];B[hb];W[fa];B[kb];W[lb]
;B[pb];W[oa];B[ke];W[le];B[dh]C[basically I'm playing endgame now. No idea what the score should be, but probably this is the point where it doesn't make sense anymore to review this game. There are a few more blunders by me, but they aren't really worth talking about. The only thing I want to know is if the bottom left corner is alive. I think it's actually unsettled right now but didn't want to play there in the game, since my opponent was apparantly thinking it's fine and I was behind all the time.
Thank you very much for your comments and best of luck in your own games.]
