C[Hi,
I'm only 2 stones stronger than you but I'll do my best to review this game and answer your questions. I'll start all my comments with a "C:"]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[ec];B[cd];W[df]C[hmm wasn't sure if its good to start taisha with hoshi on the right

C: I think this is fine if you know the complex variations, because it should be possible to find a good one for you there ( I won't go through the ones I know because that alone would be to much for this review I guess). All other variations are slightly bad for B locally so they're at least equal in the global context.]
