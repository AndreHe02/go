AB[jj][jd][jp][dj][pj][pp][dd][pd][dp]C[Hi!

I added some comments to the game. It would be nice if you showed me some major mistakes, or in some way tell me what I can do to improve.
Tthanks for reviewing my game :)
I am black, just got 16k, although I don't have enough games to say that the rank really is right.

By the way, my opponent told me that my opening was great, but I messed up in the middle game. I guess he was right. ^^

*Hi!

I'm Jonathan. I'm a 7k on KGS atm. However since i'm not anywhere close to being an amateur dan yet. Please dont take all my comments as facts, especially those out of joseki. Anyway enjoy ^^]

(;B[mq]C[I didn't know if this stone is good or not, I just put it there to test it. Was is a good choice? In the end it does not look bad to me, but I'm not 100% sure.

*Looking at the turnout after this move, I do agree that it wasn't too bad. However I personally would prefer to stick to joseki such as the following.]
;W[oq];B[op];W[lq];B[mr]C[I think this should better be Q3 or N5.]
;W[lr];B[pq];W[nr];B[mo]C[Oh, I played both in the end.. well xD]
;W[lp]C[*Another reason why I would prefer my variation is because in order to form your wall, you forced him to do M4, which made him stronger, thus threatening your stone at K4. So you had to spend another move jumping out.]
;B[jn];W[lo];B[mn];W[dn];B[fq];W[gq];B[gr];W[fp];B[eq];W[hr]

(;B[fs]C[I always wonder what to play in this situation. Should it be this (F1), G1 or even F2? I think F1 (the move i played) leaves open an eye at F2, so I'm still thinking this is the best move. Not sure again, though.

*Good train of thought, however this move does not create an eye. Let me give you an example. (see branches)]

;B[fj];W[de];B[ee];W[ed]C[*This is the weakest part about the joseki you used. Therefore, especially in such a heavily handicapped game, you can afford to spend a move to defend as i have mentioned earlier.]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[gg];W[fh];B[gf];W[gi]C[*Personally i find the next move pretty redundant. White will either connect at F11  (less efficient) or do what white did to you, which is to kill your stones instead.

*In this scenario i would prefer to run out or threaten other white stones while ensuring my own safety.]

(;B[gh];W[gj];B[di];W[dh];B[fl]C[I had to worry about my group around D10 here.

*Agreed but doing so earlier before strengthening white would have been better.]

;B[dl];W[gn];B[hq];W[ir];B[iq];W[jr];B[ln];W[bj]C[This move killed my group, didn't it?

*Not really, it is still possible to live. This is just one variation that i thought up. Since i'm doing this one-sidedly it may be wrong. If it turns out that way i'm really sry.]

C[I felt so sure that this group in the corner is settled for the moment, but after this stone I felt like it was dead, too.
Any way to keep it alive here?

*Hmm ths 3-3 point is very vital here. Especially since white has gotten thick after killing that group. I dont think i'm capable of keeping that group alive after trying out possible variations.]

(;B[qf];W[jc]C[*The result of your loose response to the low approach. White now gets the chance to gain possible territory in your moyo]

(;B[ic]C[Here I was thinking about L17, too, to seperate the two white stones. I was afraid, though, that he connects E/F16 to K7 then, so I played this "safer" move.
Right now I guess L17 would be the better move, but I'll see what you suggest here :)

*Yep i do agree L17 would have been a better move. None of your groups would have been threatened if you separate white. At the same time you get to pincer the white stone at O17 (a move you missed out earlier on).]
;W[kc]C[*This lets white live too easily.]
(;B[oc]C[My feeling now tells me that O16 could be better for me.

*Your feeling sure is right. If you had played O16, result might have been slightly better. (see branch)]
;W[nd]TR[qc]C[*After these few moves, not only has white lived, he has the opportunity to run out easily. Also you have created at weak point (3-3) white white can use to gain more advantage by making a ko out of it later.]

(;B[ko]C[I think I needed this stone to have a secure connection. If he cut at K6, the stones J6 and so on would be dead I think.

*Not really. At this point in time you really need the sente move. Besides white shld not be able to kill that group. (see branch)]

*Yep P12 would have been better since you have quite a number of stones in the area. No need to be too agressive.]

Thanks for your work!

*Well of course if all your groups are alive, there could be a chance. Afterall, in a 9 stones handicap game, if black does not make any severe mistakes, it is totally impossible for white to win.

*The thing is to keep your groups strong and less susceptible to attack instead of attempting to survive only after you find that you are in deep trouble. Afterall, you may not get your tsumego problems right in a real game.]
