;B[nc];W[pc];B[me];W[de];B[dg];W[cc];B[dd];W[cd];B[ee]C[really d18 or (more  aggressive) c18 is more important. The d16-17 stones are not very secure and  are very important for the top of the board. c18 would threaten c15 as well,  probably requiring w to respond with perhaps c14.]
;W[db];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb]C[This leaves f17 for w. You need to go one further (f17) before going up  to g18.]
;W[cf];B[df]C[Suppose w ignores your atari and plays c13? If you  take, b15 blocks you and you will have been pushed down to the 12 row instead  of the 13.]
;W[ce]C[But w didn't, so you can now play c13 :).];B[cg];W[bf];B[bg];W[pj]
;B[dl]C[Good play.];W[fc];B[hc];W[ed];B[fe];W[fd];B[ge];W[gd];B[hd];W[gb]
;B[hb]C[Given the attack, this was well contained.];W[jp];B[hq];W[jq];B
[ho];W[jn];B[of]C[Perhaps a little timid? Allows w to form a solid  barrier along Q. q14 might have been playable - if w responds p14 you can  play eg q13 and try to create a living group inside, or play p13 and try to  escape.]
;W[pf];B[oh]C[Again, q13 mght have been better. You appear to be  trying to build a large area H-O 19-12, a nice idea but not as easy to defend  as the Q-T 19-10 territory that you are giving up.]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[qg];B[og];W[oi];B[pe]C[To break in, r12 may well be better - if q11 then r14 forces  your way in.]

C[There is a proverb, don't build empty triangle (n12 n11 o11 and d17  e17 d16). m10 was risky because of w m11, and you couldn't ignore w m11, as  p13 group is not at all strong.]
;W[mg]C[I think you could play o12, if w o14  then p16 keeps you alive. So no need to surrender n12 etc..]

;B[sr];W[os];B[ns];W[ks];B[kr];W[jr];B[ls]C[Why play this? W cannot without first k1 or l3. You should  have taken sente either elsewhere entirely (h7 or p16 perhaps) or s4. The  threat to l1 is of little value, as if you play k1 w j1 b l1 w j2.]
;W[js]C[He  didn't nee to defend here.


Overall this corner was well played, establishing a group here cost w a lot.  Compare to what happended at the top right where you played more timidly.]
;B[pr];W[rp];B[rs];W[jj];B[ij]C[question... which is more important, j10 or  l11?]

;B[qe];W[qd];B[re]C[I think w  should now reply p16, you have only 3 liberties and are unlikeely to survive.  His mistake really lost the game, as you capitalised very well indeed.]
;W[rd];B[od];W[oc];B[rg]C[Good move];W[qh];B[rh];W[ri];B[rj]C[w should now play  t11 surely?]
