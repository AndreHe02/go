KM[0.5]HA[3];W[pq];B[dj];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[gq]C[F4 is perhaps  more common. It attacks the two white stones more severely. Now White can  play F4 forcing Black to answer with F3 and get away eas
ier if necessary.];W[jd];B[qo];W[mp]L[np][mq][op][kq]C[This move is normally played at 'a', 'b' or 'c'. Black can aim at playing
'd' which undermines the high White stone.];B[rq]L[ql][qk][qj]C[The corner is not so important yet, a move at 'a', 'b' or 'c' is perhaps  better.]
;W[qi];B[ql]C[If Black had played here first he would have had the  opportunity to attack White now.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[fc];B[df];W[jq];B[fn];W[ck];B[cj];W[el];B[hc]
L[dk][dl][cl][cm][bk][db][dc]C[Perhaps Black should simply play 'a'. If White play 'b' Black capture with
'c' and become thick leaving White weak with bad shape. It might also be
better if Black prepares the invasion with a big move at 'f' or 'g' defending
the corner first.];W[gd];B[hd];W[he];B[ie];W[id];B[ge]L[fb][eb][gb]
[ec][jb]C[I would attach at 'a' first to see what white do. A likely continuation is
W 'b', B 'c', W 'd' and Black crawls with 'e' but anything can happen.]
;W[hf];B[gc];W[fd];B[fe]C[This look unreasonable.];W[ic]L[fb][cc][ee]
C[This is a mistake since it is
played on the wrong side. This move is inefficent and forms a bad empty
triangle which make the stone at K16 look silly. White should play 'a'
instead which in contrast is a beautiful move, it adds liberties to the
*weak* white stones, and indirectly captures the Black. It also prepares
for playing at 'b' and 'c'. The Black invasion would then be a huge failure.]
;B[fb]
(;W[ec]C[Also a mistake I think.];B[eb];W[ib]L[dc]C[Perhaps White should at least play 'a' first making it difficult for Black
to capture White. It would not save the White stones but it would leave more
worries for Black.];B[gb]L[dc]C[Black should play 'a' eliminating the 4 white stones once for all. This
would leave White with only one kothreat in this area. And the corner would be
99% secure in the future whatever happens.];W[jf]C[Black must be very lucky to get a result like this. The invasion was going
out of control when White played several bad moves in a row. Still White
become thick now and in a handicap game this advantage tend to show itself
later in the game. Black has to be careful in the center.];B[dc]M[gb]C
[Very, very bad.  The only value this move has is that it removes some ko
threats for White. Now black has played two stones (the marked one  and this one) to make the job that just one could have done. White cannot  escape if this move is omitted since the White stones is  caught in a "loose ladder". Check this for yourself.]
;W[gl]C[White get Sente and defend the only weak white group and increase the power
in the center.];B[fk];W[fl]C[Now it is to late - Black cannot  attack this group severly.]
;B[fj]L[fi]C[Ugly, 'a' is better  locally.];W[mc];B[nc];W[cq];B[dq];W
[dr];B[er];W[br];B[cp]L[ds]C[Black should  probably force with 'a' first.]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[aq];B[ip];W[jp];B[io];W[qc];B[qd]C[Good! White should probably die  here.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rb]C[See the variation for a way of killing White.]
(;B[sd];W[pb];B[pc]L[mb][rc]C[This look like hitting one's head against a wall.
It does not fill any purpose, more natural would be to cut White  off with 'a' or capture with 'b' and defend the Black group.]
;W[rc];B[nf]L[ob][nb]C[Black should play 'a' in sente first. Now White perhaps can connect with
'b', or ruin Black eyeshape with 'a'.];W[rk];B[rl];W[rf];B[ob];W[qa];B[ld]
;W[lc];B[lf]L[rj]C[After forcing Black might consider playing the clamping move at 'a'
attacking the eye base for White.];W[mb];B[pj]C[This move just forces White to  live instead of attacking.]
;W[qj];B[pk];W[il];B[hm];W[hl];B[im]L[iq]C[This  move has no value it just give White an excuse to become
stronger in the center. Black is "pushing from behind". Locally it  would be better to play 'a', which is similar in shape but has more  territorial value and does not help White getting thicker.]
;W[hi]C[A good move. It connects White and  threaten some Black territory as a
side effect.];B[fh];W[hr];B[gr];W[hq]C[
  Kaiman 11k*: good move by white];B[hp];W[pi]C[Black has to watch out - the upper group has not  secured eyes yet!]
;B[oi];W[bn]L[bk]C[White should of course play at 'a'  first.];B[an]
;W[am];B[ao];W[ap];B[bk]L[ds][cr][es]C[Black should play 'a' first. White would play 'b' or risk the entire corner.  This is important because White 'c' could become sente now. And that would be  an unconditional loss of at least two points.]
;W[bl];B[cl]C[This is a mistake.];W[dk];B[ek];W[dl];B[aj]L[ak][bj]
C[Black  should play 'a' here, if White has more ko threats White 'a' might force  Black to play  'b' in a ko fight.]
;W[on];B[pn]L[oo]C[This move looks non
urgent. Black 'a' might be more interesting.];W[oo]C[White  get excellent shape and flatten Black with this exchange.]
;B[om]L[qr]C[This  move is completely valueless. Black 'a' is very big now. Black must remember
to take the initiative as soon as White have played a move that does not have
to be answered locally.];W[nm]L[qr]C[White takes a risk, White should play 'a'...]
;B[ol]L[qr][pr]C[... since Black could play 'a' first forcing 'b']
;W[eo]M[ol][om]C[
It would have been bigger for Black to defend here instead of the  marked stones. This group is much more likely to die than the right group and  there is more territory involved as well.]
;B[ep]L[fp][fo][gp]C[Black 'a' is better shape - it would defend in all  directions. Now white can ruin the Black eysehape completely with 'b' in  sente, since the cut at 'c' is threatened.]
;W[kn]L[qr];B[mk]L[fo]C[
A move at 'a' is bigger and safer.];W[ki];B[jl]L[fo]C[A move at 'a'  is bigger and safer. The move played here is dangerous and valueless.]
;W[ij]L[fo]C[White is kind... White defends stones that would
be much better defended with ... 'a'.];B[nl]L[mm]M[mk]C[Black is  pushing from behind gaining one point loosing three. The proper endgame move  (if all groups are safe would be to attack at 'a' using the marked stone.]
;W[mm]M[nk][nn][mn][ln]C[The white stone Make White thicker and the  threatend Black group to the left weaker.]
;B[lm]C[This look very awkward considering Black could have played a similar move
earlier before White got thick.];W[ln];B[km]L[fo]C[Still 'a' is  better.]
;W[gi];B[fi]L[gg][qr][fo]C[Very slow move it is better to defend  indirectly at 'a' or play elsewhere at 'b' or 'c']
;W[gg]M[ei][ej]C[The difference between White playing here and Black is certainly at  least 4-5 points and Black had the chance to play here for a cost of just two  points below.]
;B[fg]L[qr][fo][ff][ef][gf][ee]M[eg]C[And if one play defensive  moves like this all the time - one will lose. Black 'a' followed by 'b' is  worth much, much more than the single point(!) black defend
s here. White can still play W 'c', B 'd' (because of to few  liberties), W 'e' and B 'f' in sente and the move played here does not make  any difference to this result. It would be better to play black 'c' instead
of F13.];W[fo]C[Now Black is in trouble.First White play this move worth at  least 6 points in sente. Remember that a move in sente is worth double the  amount in gote since the sente player can continue with
 a big gote move.];B[go];W[fp];B[gp];W[qr]L[rr]C[This move would have  been sente for Black if he had played it, and worse still 'a' is now so big  that Black cannot play elsewhere. Thus white get about 6 points here for
*free*. If a move happens to be sente for both  players it *has* to be played by the first player that has  the opportunity,  otherwise the other play will steal it from him in sente and then go back
and defend where "the first opportunity" player played instead.];B[ds];W
[cr];B[mi]L[ll]C[Both Black and White is unaware of  the aji of White 'a' which would cut of Black. See a the
variation. [I have accidentaly added the same variation twice if  and I do not trust mgt enough to try to delete one of them\]]

(;W[lh];B[mh]
(;W[jn]C[Bad move. It might have ruined White's chance to  win the game.]
;B[jm];W[fq]L[eq][fr][fs][do][es]C[Black can defend  with 'a', W 'b', B 'c' and if White 'd' Black connect with 'e' and there is  nothing White can do.]
;B[fr];W[eq];B[hs];W[ir];B[is]C[This is 1 point gote.];W[js];B[gs];W[oh]
;B[ni]L[nh][oj]C[Black can play  'a' gaining a point and get better shape. If White play atari at 'b' nothing  will happen.]
;W[og]L[rr][rp]C[I have mentioned earlier that 'a' is very big,
if White play here White can capture the Black stone with 'b' so it is more
or less sente for White to play 'a'. But  it cannot be left unplayed because it is too profitable for Black to prevent
this sente play.];B[of];W[kg];B[jj];W[ji];B[kj];W[mg];B[ng];W[lg];B[kc]
;W[kd]C[Dangerous...  unless one has read it all out.]
(;B[mf];W[sc]L[md][nh]M[kc]C[Black is taking risks now,
but White seem unaware of that. If White play 'a' and Black answer I  beleive that the cut at 'b' will Kill Black. This mean that Black have to  play something else and White can capture and eliminate
the bad aji of the marked stone.];B[se];W[sf];B[sk]L[na][kb][pa]
[rr]C[Black has som very interesting  aji. Black 'a' is a devilish move; it threaten to capture three white stones  with Black 'b' *and* it also threaten to kill White with 'c' in a ko fight. A  complication is of course that the Black group itself is not entirely alive.  The move played is of course worth nothing in comparison, beside
s that 'd' is still the biggest endgame move.];W[sj];B[qk]L[sl]C[Very  bad of course. If Black defends with 'a' the move played now will be sente  later, so Black get both points easily.]
;W[sl];B[sm];W[sk];B[rm];W[cs];B[pp]L[rr]C[Good! Black did not answer White. Put  perhaps Black should play 'a' first avoiding complications. Or perhaps kill  and/or save some stones in the upper right...]

C[There are better points in the upper right...];B[md]L[kb][na][nb]
[pa]C[Black should play 'a' which would force White to play 4 moves to capture it
- and most importantly - Black will get to play 'b' and 'c' in sente and can
play 'd' to start a ko against the corner, White has no good ko threats
 and Black has least 3-4 good ones. In this ko Black would only risk  1 point so it is a typical flower viewing ko, black cannot lose anything from  starting it.]

Black has to improve the following:

*Improve the reading since many mistakes was because of
- pure reading mistakes
- the bad habit of defending too much as a safety measure instead of  reading carefully will generate many moves worth almost nothing compared to  playing elsewhere.
- black did not see some winning sequences in the upper right and the  lower left.

*Improve the feeling for the endgame.
When there is no complicated middlegame fighting, it is in principle  possible to assign a numerical value to the endgame moves on the board.  Always consider three different moves from the entire board and compare  1) What is the size of the move?  2) Is it Sente or Gote for me?
3) Is it Sente or gote for the opponent?
In the game played the order of the endgame moves was almost random  sometimes and often it was move picked very close to the last move played. If  player plays a 6-point move you should think "Hmm, ca
n find a 6-point move somewhere on the board ?" *not* "Where can I  defend close to this move just in case it threatened something? Wow, here is  a move that defends one point as well!"...]
