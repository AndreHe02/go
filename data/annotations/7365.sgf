C[Elsien [9k\]: Hi, Have a good game :)
Reiji [8k\]: hi gg
Elsien [9k\]: +++ Thank you, in advance, for the review :) +++

JJHaggar: You are welcome ;)  I'm JJ, the reviewer, I'll try to comment doing my best.  I also will try to put some useful variations in certain moves.]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[oc]
(;B[oe]C[Elsien [9k\]: --I played here thinking, let him have the corner if he wants, then I can extend to the bottom

JJHaggar: It's a strange play, I think it is not the correct direction but I'm not sure of it]

(;W[md]C[Elsien [9k\]: -- I was unsure how to respond to this move, so I took the corner but it was a bad shape i think.

JJHaggar: It seems that he didn't want you to make points on the upper side]
;B[pc];W[od]
(;B[pd]C[Elsien [9k\]: -- Q15 just bothers me...

JJHaggar: Never make empty triangles!!!! 99'9% of the time it is a really bad idea!!! :(]
;W[qi];B[jq]C[Elsien [9k\]: -- Then I plyed away feeling that the corner had room enough to either run or live, and I also thought that this was an urgent place to play.

JJHaggar: I think it's a good move];W[mq];B[gq];W[fp]TR[jc]
[jd][cj][dj]C[Elsien [9k\]: This move annoyed me, I was unsure how to respond, or even if i had to.

JJHaggar: Are you in danger? No, so go to the biggest movest (Remember the proverb: "1st urgent moves, 2nd biggest moves"). I marked the ones I think are bigger, but I think the best ones are C10 & D10, because they are also a good continuation for white and that makes them keypoints.]
;B[er]C[Elsien [9k\]: I think this was probably just a bad idea and came from not enough reading.

JJHaggar: Reading is VERY important! Well, this is a small move now, but I think it's correct locally]
;W[fq]C[JJHaggar: You must not play moves and then change your mind and abandone the stone/s, specially when it will give your rival a clear advantage]

(;B[gp]C[Elsien [9k\]: So I let him take it

JJHaggar: I think you should rescue that stone ^^U];W[fr]C[JJHaggar: OUCH!! it's a VERY BIG MOVE!! :(  white is attacking your G3 group while making a really bid corner. On the top of it he is preparing a perfect extension at around C10 or D10]

(;B[fo]C[JJHaggar: It's dangerous to make Hane against a so strong group :(]
;W[go]C[JJHaggar: Ouch! ^^U];B[eo];W[do]
(;B[fn]C[JJHaggar: Argh! Another empty triangle! ^^U]
(;W[kp];B[ho];W[jp];B[ip];W[kq]
(;B[pn]TR[qn][ho][gp][ip][qp][gq][jq]C[Elsien [9k\]: Maybe I should have secured my G3 group before I tenuki?

JJHaggar: I think tenuki is ok, but I would suggest S6 (or maybe R4)]
;W[jn]
(;B[qk]C[Elsien [9k\]: I didn't think about K6 being a ladder breaker, I think I should have responded to it instead.
JJHaggar: Yes, it could be a good idea to play J6 or H7

Elsien [9k\]: At this point I am really not liking that whole situation on the bottom, and I feel like I am fighting from behind with weaknesses all over. At least in hind sight
JJHaggar: Yes, right now you have now three weak groups: E5, G4 and the one you have just created :( On the top of that, R16 group has got a very bad shape, and it will surely hurt later :(]
;W[qf]C[JJHaggar: Vital point]
(;B[qe]TR[pd][qd]C[JJHaggar: Very bad shape, it gives white a free move at Q14 :S]
;W[pf]C[Elsien [9k\]: I probably should have filled, but I thought I had easy life.

JJHaggar: Free move! You MUST play Q15!]
