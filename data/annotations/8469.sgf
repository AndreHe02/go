AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,

I am playing black in this game and I am currently rated 6(?) on the KGS server.

Hello,
Your game went alright. I feel like you could have won by about 20 points, if you had obtained more territory in the lower right hand corner.
*Try to maintain sente.
*Play lightly.
All my proceeding comments will be marked with *.
-dtslife];W[pp];B[dc];W[qf];B[ph]C[Should I just have played C15 here to take the corner?

*either way works. Since black has more stones, as long as you play joseki, you should have an advantage.]
;W[of];B[nd];W[pj];B[ce];W[fq];B[hq];W[fo];B[dn];W[jq]LB[ho:A]
C[perhaps you want to jump out at A here.];B[eq]C[Is this Joseki? What would the right move be?

*No, e3 strengthens white.];W[gq]SQ[hq]C[*Black's stone is now under pressure.]
;B[ho]C[*This just mp is not as effective because white can hane underneath.]
;W[hr];B[gp];W[fp];B[iq];W[ir];B[jo]C[*I like white's out come here.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[dl];B[ch];W[co];B[do];W[bm];B[cn];W[bn];B[bo]
LB[cr:A]C[*White can try playing at A later or perhaps now.(see continuation)]
(;W[cp];B[bp];W[cq];B[bq];W[cr];B[br];W[er];B[dr]C[I was actually quite happy with this...

*good read];W[em]C[... but w seems to be able to cut my corner off from the outside.]
;B[id];W[ic]C[Was this a good move by w?

*white is testing you to see your reaction.];B[hc];W[jc]
(;B[hd]LB[hb:A]C[*too slow. A would have been better beause it cuts off white's base.]
;W[mc];B[nc];W[md];B[me];W[le];B[mf];W[jd];B[if];W[qh];B[ng]
C[Maybe M14 would have been better here.];W[rd];B[qc];W[jf]
;B[ig];W[dg];B[cg];W[de];B[dd];W[cf];B[bf];W[df];B[be];W[dh]
;B[di]
(;W[ei]LB[ci:A][dj:B]SQ[if][ig]C[*White could could try to cut at A, leading to a fight (see variation). You're two black stones would have given you a slight advantage.
You could  have extended to B and kept on the pressure.]
(;B[ci];W[ej];B[eh]C[It turned out that this cut wasn't a good play.

*yes, it wasn't good because white has the net.];W[fh];B[eg]
;W[ff];B[fe];W[ef];B[ee];W[gi]C[Now white has a solid group.]
;B[lf];W[ke];B[jg];W[mb];B[nb];W[hb];B[gb];W[ib];B[nq];W[oq]
C[*You can't really build a base here. When white contacts you, you can try to approach from the other side too.]
(;B[np];W[pn];B[kq]C[*nice clamp];W[jp];B[kp];W[jr];B[op]LB[ln:A]
C[*I don't see the necessity or purpose of this move right now.
*Protect your cutting point at L5.];W[or]LB[pq:A]C[* White get's strengthened, although white should have connect at q3.
*see variation for a weak point( a cut).]
(;B[og]LB[pg:A]C[*You can try double-peeping at A];W[pg];B[pi]
;W[qi];B[oe];W[ko]C[Arrgh! Now I have two weak groups.];B[lo]
C[Decided to sacrifice one to keep the other alive.];W[kn];B[ln]
;W[jn];B[hm]C[I figured that I couldn't save the whole group but maybe I can use the influence.]
;W[io];B[jj];W[oj];B[mj];W[nm];B[mm];W[oo];B[nl];W[om];B[jl]
C[I thought that went quite well.

*White had a huge gain  on the right side, and managed to reduce your territory.
*You did okay, but there was more to be had!];W[hp];B[ma];W[la]

*Yes I agree white's response wasn't optimal.];W[sb];B[ns]C[I didn't see Q17 as a threat. That probably cost me the game.
*Yes you are right.
*This is gote. You aren't forcing your opponent to respond.]
