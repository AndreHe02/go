C[I really apreciate the review, this is probably the first game I've played where I gave my moves so much thought, mostly because it was played on OGS and I had plenty of time.

Apart from the fuseki, which I really need to work on, I don't think I made any terrible moves, but I still believe I can learn alot from this game.

Thanks again for the review.

----------------------

Hello, I'm Andreas and I'm ~13k, bit rusty at the moment, because I do not get to play that much, but I will give you my thoughts on this one]
;B[ij]LB[jj:1][jk:2]C[
I do not really like that move very much. On the 13x13 it looks a bit hig and you cannot use the influence that much.

1 or 2 are fine];W[dd];B[jd]TR[kj]C[This is a good move that takes a corner and has some meaning to the other stone you played.]

(;W[hc]TR[dj]C[Kindof early for a white approach move there, as there is still an open corner]
;B[fj]LB[dj:3][ck:2][dk:1][fk:4]TR[gk][hk][kk]C[this one looks a bit slow and to high
I probably would play 3, if I look at the picture, but really something in the corner.
2 with the idea to cash points now and then come back to fix the other corner and side are fine as well.

Fuseki for Beginners:
first. Corners
second. Sides
last. Center];W[kk]
(;B[ki]LB[ch:4][ci:3][cj:2][ck:1]TR[ij]C[Well, maybe, but white can ignore it and still leave some aji in teh corner. The J4 L5 shape is not a shimari

The left side looks urgent, but I don't really know where to play considering the f4 stone

maybe now C3, then after something like c6 .. whatever .. well look at variation

l5 is quite severe on the l3 stone, just pointing out that white might react differently.]

(;W[il]
(;B[kf]LB[ch:2][ci:3][cj:4][ck:1]SQ[jd][ki][ij]C[This looks to slow as the left side is still wide open. Problem is still where to play.

The stones marked with rectangles seem to be overconcentrated.
A teacher said in the opening the stones are supposed to "work hard"

Don't scatter around to much and leave weak goups to much though. The K10 stone still has some options though.]
;W[jb];B[cj]C[Good move to ignore k12 and take that corner IMHO. L11 looks quite big, but submissive.]
;W[fd]TR[cg];B[gl]LB[kc:2][cf:3][cg:1]C[Take the side first. Second line moves, with open spaces somewhere usually arn't the way to go.
1 or 2 look bigger, I prefer 1 maybe 3.

Your move threatens a real big corner though, thus it's];W[cg]
C[Hrmpf ... Now white got it first.]
(;B[gg]LB[cc:2][kc:1]C[Now, things get intersting. How many points will there be in the middle. L11 looks like a big move.
and the c11 invision should still be possible.];W[kc]LB[cc:1]
C[Probably invade now at C11, before the chance is gone.];B[ld]
C[Looks soft.];W[bi]C[Getting B4 first, looks interesting. At least as it isn't sure the corner is really dying.]

(;B[jk];W[kj];B[jl];W[lj]
(;B[mi]LB[bj:A][jj:1][ik:2]TR[li]SQ[lk][mk][ll][ml][lm][mm]
C[Why leave that weakness ?
N5 looks not really correct here and the shape marked in the corner is dead, but thre is a weakness at 1 and 2 white can expoit.Which can result in some akward fighting.

And we would like to play a first. So probably force white to live small in gote then play A]

(;W[bj]
(;B[cl]TR[ck]C[Maybe too timid?

---

Not timid, but not solid enough, the weakness at c3 isn't necessairy.]
;W[ce]
(;B[ll]C[Well you spent to many moves killing the corner now. Most likely it is already dead.]
;W[kl];B[km];W[bk]
(;B[dh]C[Interesting decision what is bigger. I probably just would defend at c3]
;W[ck]
(;B[dk];W[dj]TR[ek]C[I think e3 is the best defence here. Just secrivice c4 it is not important]

(;B[ci];W[dl];B[ek]C[This is what I was hoping would happen, but could I have done anything better than that?

----

Yes, play c3 instead of c2 ealier..Now you have a problem.]
;W[el]LB[hd:1][ef:2]C[Tenuki possible ? I think so, if I do not misread it.]

;B[eg];W[me];B[mf];W[mc]C[Thanks for the sente, Aya]
(;B[ji]TR[jf]C[I use it to make sure he doesn't live there, it was scaring me for a long time.

---

He won't live but the cut at k8 is a problem. K5 protects this as well, but it is very timid]
;W[id];B[ie];W[de];B[cc]C[I'm not very good at counting territory, so I wasn't sure if I was winning or losing and just figured "What the hell I'll try this."

----

It is to late now, usually when the borders are closed without much weaknesses, living there gets pretty hard.

But if you not sure give it a try.];W[db];B[ca];W[cb];B[bb]

I'm really looking forward to your review, thanks again!

Summary:

* Quite solid game you played there, for 20k.
* Look for open corners and sides in Fuseki.
* Do not leave unecessairy weaknesse like m5 and c3

Well played, apart from that.


Hope it helps. Direct any further questions to cadellin@dragoncairn.net

Good luck with your games]N[RESULT])
