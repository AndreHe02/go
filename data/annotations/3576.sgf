C[romer [1k\]: hi
killabee [2k\]: yo!

I felt I did well in this game, but lost the game because of allowing a large center group to my opponent.  My main questions are how to play more properly in order to avoid these kinds of situations, and how to recognize them and profit on them.

I thank you in advance for reviewing this game!

MR: It would be good to know whether you played white or black ...]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[oq];W[dp];B[df]C[MR: Black plays unconventional opening.]
;W[ce]C[romer [1k\]: thx gg];B[de];W[cd];B[ec];W[eb];B[dd]C[MR: I would be afraid of white playing F17 instead of C18.]
;W[cb];B[fc];W[fb];B[hc];W[qj];B[fq];W[ip]
(;B[cn]C[MR: Feels like wrong direction. The left side is totally unimportant because of the white corner in the upper left that is open to the bottom. Instead, I would have expected black F5, white C6 followed by a black pincer attack.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq];W[eq];B[cp];W[fr]C[MR: This result is good for white.]
;B[ck]C[MR: Again wrong direction. The corner is save anyway and the left side is totally unimportant. You should better play e.g. a shimari in the lower right.]
;W[qp]C[I felt my result here was adequate from the large slant.

MR: I feel that the game is good for white.];B[pn];W[po];B[oo]
;W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[pl];W[ql];B[pp];W[qo];B[qq];W[rq];B[rr]
C[I played this to avoid a peep at o4 in sente];W[qr];B[pq]
;W[sr];B[lq];W[od];B[qf]C[i felt this was kind of weak, though i didn't want w to have the side

MR: I think that this move is ok.];W[qc];B[pc];W[pd];B[qb];W[rc]
;B[rd];W[pb]C[MR: I think that it is not a very good idea of white to take the corner - unless he is sure to kill the right side black group in the fight that is ahead ...]
;B[oc];W[rb];B[ob]C[MR: It is not good to exchange P18 for R19. If you just play O17, white anyway has to take the stone with R19, because else black R19 kills the corner.]
;W[qa];B[mc];W[of];B[qh];W[pg];B[qg];W[oi];B[mf]C[MR: I would want to play S10 and live with the right side black group ... Or did you both read that this does not work? I would try to start with S11.]
;W[gc]C[MR: Similarly, I would want to kill the black group on the right.]
;B[gd];W[gb];B[hd];W[pj];B[ri];W[rj];B[nd];W[oe];B[ng];W[ph]
;B[sc];W[sb];B[sd]C[MR: Is this group alive?]
(;W[cf];B[dg];W[jg]C[I handled this stone badly in the long run, i believe, though W didn't seem to know what to do with it either

MR: I agree. This stone is a good moment to pause in the game and ask oneself : "what are my goals in this game". Of course, to win the game. But: where to get the territory from? where to fight? where to destroy the others territory?
In this game, it appears that neither black nor white has much territory. Assuming that the black group in the upper right counts as "alive", both sides have about the same amount of territory. There is not much potential for large future territory for both sides. If black manages to block at C13, he has territory on the left, blocking at H18 gives some territory on the upper side (although small), playing around L6 could give some territory on the lower side. Of course, if one could capture the white stone at K13, this would be large territory. But this seems a bit overoptimistic. 
As white, I would want to play C12 and see that K13 is not captured - this should be good enough for white to win the game.

Therefore, my plan as black would be to get as many large territory oriented moves as possible while not allowing white to form larger additional territories.]
;B[cg]C[MR: Good.];W[ji]C[MR: Also good.];B[hb];W[je];B[hg]
C[i felt this was larger than k17 or somewhere

MR: I think this move is not very large. Also, did you check that you can live or connect with the group around N17 when white plays once more on the upper side?]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[dk];B[dj];W[cl];B[bl];W[dl];B[cj];W[ej];B[bg]
C[MR: This seems inconsistent with H13. You should at least exchange E11 for F10. Also, you must watch for white making not too much territory on the lower left. E.g., L6 would be much more "on topic".]
;W[hj];B[ei];W[fj];B[dn];W[en];B[bc]C[MR: Again "off topic"]
;W[cc];B[ad]C[MR: and gote ...];W[ae];B[be];W[bd];B[af];W[bb]
C[MR: Ok, white made it sente for you ...];B[rs];W[rp]C[I'm not sure why w played this way.  i saw potential aji in this area, my reason for playing this

MR: I also do not see why white plays like this. In my opinion white has just enough liberties to play at R1.]
;B[pr];W[ko]C[I totally missed this point

MR: Yes. Now it becomes quite difficult to reduce the white territory in the center ...]
;B[km];W[ln];B[lm];W[mn]
(;B[nm]C[MR: This move tries to be a double purpose move, but leaves the cutting point at N7. Looks strange!]
;W[mm];B[lk];W[ml];B[mk]C[MR: Heavy and overoptimistic.];W[mh]
;B[nk];W[nl];B[ok];W[ll];B[kk];W[kl];B[jk];W[jl];B[ik];W[hm]
C[MR: Again a good moment to pause. White has slightly more territory on the board than black and no weak groups to fight against.

The largest open area appears to be the lower side, so black should play at J2, activating the aji of connecting at G3. Next largest would be L16 on the upper side. Of course, I again "count" the black group on the right as alive.]
;B[hl]C[MR: Too small.];W[il];B[hk];W[fi];B[jc];W[dr];B[ir]
;W[hq];B[cr];W[jr];B[jq]C[MR: You could play L2 instead ...]
;W[kr];B[kq];W[iq];B[lr];W[hr];B[ks];W[is];B[sj];W[sk];B[si]
;W[pk];B[ol];W[rk]C[i'm pretty sure this wasn't necessary

MR: But why the hell did you play T10 then?];B[fl]C[MR: I would prefer to close off some part of the upper side.]
;W[gm];B[ek];W[em];B[gk];W[fk];B[gl]C[i played this way for sente, kinda hamete hoping w would go for the cut all the way]
;W[el];B[fg];W[me];B[ne];W[nf]C[a better way to handle this cut?]
;B[le];W[mg]C[MR: Large for white.];B[lf];W[kd];B[kc];W[ld]
;B[md];W[lc];B[lb];W[if];B[jp];W[jo];B[oa];W[pa];B[ni];W[nh]
;B[kg];W[kh];B[jd];W[ke];B[kf]C[MR: Very strange. Should be at J15, white K14, black H14.]
;W[ie];B[ih];W[jh];B[ae]C[MR: If you want to play in this area, you should play at A17.]

and i got shredded in yose.  comments on that might help, too.  I could have had a few more points had I counted the ko threats too, but I didn't, and went for it.

MR: I feel that there are two major points to improve your game. 
1) Take a pause in the important moments of the game, count, think about the game situation and make a plan that you then follow through for the next moves.
2) In jose, I had the feeling that you only thought two moves in advance, when mayby 3 or 5 would have been good. Especially, think about 
- what is sente and what is gote
- whether your opponent can recapture stones in the upcoming moves (which you then maybe do not want to play in the first place)]
)
(;B[lk]C[MR: I would try M9 with the double option of connection to the right at 08 or to the top at N11. Both are no strong connections, but the main idea is that black connects "some" stones that are in the white moyo to the outside.]
