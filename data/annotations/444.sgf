WL[284];B[ce]BL[265];W[od]WL[280];B[md]C[so far, black is looking good.  a reasonable openning.  I would tend  to prefer a moves like B p17, q17 or q14 here.]

;B[nc]C[O17 doesn't really help black that much.  White isn't that significantly restricted and black is playing too tight.  Something around K16 would stake a claim to some territory while
doing as much to limit white's potential]BL[186];W[kc]WL[239];B[ic]C[I think that if you play a move like J17, you need to be prepared to sacrifice O17
group.  You may not need to, but you shouldn't cling to their hope of life.   Use the threat of O17 living to build up J17 and R15 groups.]
BL[142];W[ke]WL[222];B[mf]C[This is probably not the best strategy. J15, for example, would have boxed in a lot of  territory while leaving the threat of N15 as a powerful force.   That being said, N15 isn't disastrous.  But you need to play it with a clear goal beyond "I'm not willing to let any of my stones die."]
BL[142];W[gd]C[Now white is really asking for trouble.  He is very agressive and is making the same mistakes black did.  What does white hope to accomplish?  Wars on multiple fronts  are very complicated.  Blacks best strategy at this point should be to simplify the game
by making some solid groups and attacking the weakness in whites over aggression.]
WL[219];B[ie]BL[136];W[oh]WL[209];B[kf]BL[53];W[le]WL[205];B[me]C[black is being too stubborn.  Black should be making very solid groups.  All the groups
are weak.  Perhaps M14 here?  That forces white to either cut at N15 (judging from his style - he would probably do that) or to try to rescue G16 stone.  B N15 seems like a good
move perhaps if B were aiming at the Q16 cut?  I don't know if that would work, but it seems the only reason to stubbornly cling to these stones]
BL[49];W[lf]WL[204];B[lg]C[black cannot succeed at this line of play  white will escape and both will have weak groups.   Again, Q16 seems possible.  Otherwise, black should be content just to pull his groups to
the center.]BL[47];W[jf]WL[202];B[kg]BL[45];W[je]WL[201];B[if]C[This move helps blacks upper left position.]

BL[533];W[mi]WL[136];B[li]BL[525];W[lj]C[B cannot allow himself to be surrounded here.  N11 seems like a good move.  If white definds at P11 then B L10 and L11?   Q16 starting to look even more attractive.  Alternatively, black might consider trying to make an eye at the bottom of the board.]

get in there sometime soon.  R6 perhaps?]BL[202];W[sb]WL[521];B[rc]BL[186]

C[E13 is small This would have been the correct time to play in lower right.  R3? R6? O3?   Somewhere down there to keep white from dominating that side of the board.]
BL[144];W[gg]WL[499];B[qn]C[Black has the right ideas, but is always a bit late in playing them.]
BL[98];W[ql]WL[473];B[pl]C[Q8 seems ill fated.  White is strong here - he can't really expect to pull too much out.   attacking the corner seems the way to go.  R3? S4? Maybe P6, depending on exactly
what his goals are.]BL[52];W[pm]WL[458];B[qm]BL[50];W[pk]WL[457];B[ol]BL
[47];W[qk]WL[456];B[on]C[This looks promising for black.  white doesn't play too aggresively.  B gets an eye and has  good enough position to make another...]
BL[591];W[ok]WL[454];B[nl]BL[582];W[jq]WL[449];B[np]C[This is a bit high.  Is the purpose to be an extension which puts pressure on white, or an attack which has the potential to connect to the strong black group?]

BL[127];W[ir]WL[365];B[iq]C[J3 is an overplay.  This will probably end with B losing sente.  There is a lot of empty space  along the west side of the board which could be claimes.  Save this region for later.]
BL[124];W[jp]WL[364];B[hr]C[black should be more careful.]BL[122];W[kr]
WL[598];B[lr]BL[118];W[js]C[ouch.  black keeps sente, but a big mistake]
WL[596];B[eq]C[ No.  This is the wrong direction.  H2 and J3 are far too weak to extend from.  This doesn't
attack the corner well.  Attacking from the other direction seems more prudent.]

instead.  we definately don't want a ko.  H14 makes W J16 good, but it probably evens
out and keeps B from losing big here]BL[418];W[se]WL[500];B[qa]BL[399];W

[fb]BL[74];W[gb]WL[467];B[hl]C[a reasonable retreat.  B had some big losses, but now needs to focus on pulling something out of these weak groups...]
BL[72];W[eo]WL[461];B[fo]BL[63];W[fn]WL[597];B[go]C[black is playing into white's hands.  these stones are far to weak to be deffending like this.  white is building a wall  between the two black groups - which weakens both even more.]

group can no longer make two eyes - at least not easily.  Why struggle so hard for just one?
Make the connection and they all live.]BL[32];W[hm]WL[575];B[im]BL[31];W
[in]WL[570];B[io]C[Not good.  Think about the goal here. F2 group can live fairly easily.  The worst situation is  that it comes to a ko.  But, J5 doesn't help in that regard anyways.  Why not at least try to pull something out of the weak H7 group?  Maybe it can connect with O8 group? (or
make eyes in the process)  It's a slim chance, but it's all you have.]BL
