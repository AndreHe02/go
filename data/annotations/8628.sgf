C[Hi, this is Wonodan from KGS, I will start my comments with W:

---

I thought I might try a new opening. Something like the Sanhoshi (3Star) but with a lowered middle.

W: The 3 star formation is called a san-ren-sei =)];B[pd];W[dc]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[qj]C[After he played Komuko-Hoshi i feel quiet save]
(;W[hd]C[I have no real idea what that could mean. I excepted more aggressice behavior like an attack at Q16 or Q4.]
;B[jq]TR[qj]C[Looks like the biggest portion of the board. Keeping it symetrical.

W: Usually the marked stones are played one line higher. When White invades, Black's moyo is flat and can be flattened further.]
(;W[ce]
(;B[dn]TR[cg][eg][gg]C[I think I got a nice position on the right, so lets attack. Not sure if it's the right way.

W: The high move is used when you can build a moyo out of it. Here you don't have stones helping this stone build a moyo.]
;W[fp]C[trying to secure some corner]
(;B[fn]LB[cl:A]C[W: It looks like Black's stones are safe, but White can launch severe attacks starting from A because Black didn't bother to make a base.]
;W[nc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne]C[I played here because I've got a good mojo below and think connecting at P16 would be very much too passive.

W: Yes, O16 is not a normal move, but used for a moyo.];W[oc]
;B[pc];W[jc]
(;B[dj]C[Looking at it now, it seems loke my group is a little high. This move should probably at C10.

W: The move is fine, it settles the group, and it's hard for White to launch an attack now.]
(;W[np]
(;B[nq];W[mq];B[oq];W[mp];B[om]C[Joseki would be Q7 But i feel R10 gives nice backup for this move at P7.]
;W[ch]C[W: You attacked, and White ignores.]
(;B[kf]C[I still think Playing here is a good move because it creates a nice mojo below. With D10 at C10 i would feel a little safer. Because of the possibility of an undercut at wB9.

W: The idea is good, but you're open at the bottom so White can make your moyo smaller here.]
;W[mm]C[W: Now it's harder to attack the White stones, since White gained some momentum with this move.]
;B[hp]
(;W[mk]
(;B[nk]C[W: Touching helps your opponent. Go is a surrounding game, not a touching game.]
(;W[mj];B[nj];W[co];B[cn]C[White now secured his corner, but why didnt, he undercut at B9/10 in sente.]

(;B[hr]
(;W[gr];B[jr]C[Played it just for good shape. but i might have better played kosumi at L2  or kogeima at M2.

W: Still simplest to just connect with the living group with G5.]
;W[go];B[hn];W[ci];B[el]C[Feared a cut at D9. thought this could be light play.]

;B[jo]C[To make sure i get a little more solid here because of the strong position white has.

W: Could have been avoided earlier, by simply connecting at G5 and denying White the cutting move of G5.]
;W[gn];B[gm];W[hm];B[im]C[This is something i dont understand. by playing here white forced me to atari.

W: Weaker players tend to make weaker moves.];W[il]C[white still has sente and now forces to capture.]

W: The board is more or less settled. You could play the marked sente move first.]

I never really know where the big point to play are.

W: Your opening was better than White's for sure. The problem was in the middle game, where you neglected to attack the White middle group.

The whole game was about the White middle group. Note how White has 14 points. If you had attacked while keeping White on his toes, he wouldn't have been able to gather that many points.

When your opponent invades your strong area, you must keep him under pressure by constantly attacking when he's weak.

By weak I mean a group that does not yet have eyes or eye shape, thus making it a good target practice. =)]

(;B[ll]C[W: The White group is completely surrounded by Black, and does not have 2 solid eyes yet. It's possible to keep harrassing by playing on his vital point. I'm not saying White is dead, I'm saying he will have a struggle ahead of him now. =)]

(;B[km]C[W: Keep attacking White from moves he'd like to play himself, shape moves or vital points. This keeps White on his toes and his group in the middle won't surround points.]

Because Black is weak, the White group A is a strong wall.]

(;B[go]LB[mp:A]C[W: Go is a surrounding game. If you get closed in, you're unhappy. If you close in, you're happy.

Here Black closes White in the corner while connecting all his stones in the bottom left area, so Black is happy.

Because Black is strong, the White group A is a string of stones with no eyes.]

If your opponent doesn't defend, attacking him becomes urgent.

Doesn't look like White will be able to cash that many points with N4 group anymore, does it? =)]

If White plays here, Black's moyo becomes smaller while White's moyo becomes bigger.
