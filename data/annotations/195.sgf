;W[pc];B[dp];W[pp];B[qe];W[ph];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb]C[PG: this does not seem right; I think White  can play R16 and get a better result. I give one possible continuation for  White
in B.]
(;W[ob]C[PG: this is wrong; Black gets to push White around.];B[pd];W[od]
;B[oe];W[pf];B[nd];W[oc];B[pe];W[rc];B[rd];W[sc];B[qd]C[PG: aji keshi; Black  should keep this ko in reserve for latter.]
;W[sb];B[og]C[PG: I think  protecting against the cut may be better. If not, White gets a lot at the top  and, in any case, Black's
prospects on theright side are unpromising.];W[ne];B[me];W[nf];B[of];W[md]
;B[pg];W[fc];B[kc]L[hd][id][fd][df][cf][cg]C[PG: Too close to White's  thickness: if Black wants to pincer 'a' or 'b' are better even though a  pincer is unwise at this
point. I would prefer a move at 'c', 'd', 'e' or 'f'.];W[df];B[mf]C[PG: this  is sente but goes against the direction of play; the corner should be settled  first.]
;W[ng];B[nh];W[mg];B[ke];W[mh];B[ni];W[ee];B[ce];W[cf];B[eb];W[fb];B[qn]
C[PG: Again, not the right direction. White has just built considerable  thickness on the left side and can launch a severe
attack on the center black stones.];W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qo];W[qp];B[ql]
;W[np];B[nk];W[db]L[ld][ic]C[PG: yose move. 'a' or 'b' are called for here.]
;B[ec];W[ea];B[cb];W[ic];B[ed]C[PG: small, Black must defend the center  stones.]
;W[fe]L[fd]C[PG: 'a' is better.];B[fd];W[gd];B[ge];W[hd];B[gf];W[if]
C[PG: Bad for Black, more weak stones to worry about.];B[lg];W[ih];B[jg]
;W[ig];B[ki];W[cn];B[cl]L[fp][jq]C[PG: This is no good. Black should  play at 'a' or nearby. This pincer is usually played if Black allready has an  extension
around 'b'.]
(;W[en]C[PG: nothing wrong with this move I guess, but I would  prefer playing at 'a'. The variation that follows should be sente for
White who will then be able to extend along the lower side and nullify  Black's result. (See variation B)]
;B[ci];W[fp];B[co];W[dn];B[bn]C[PG: This  weakens the stones on the left side.]
;W[bm];B[bo];W[cm];B[gi]L[fk]C[PG:  Black is trying to play lightly I guess but this is the wrong point. 'a' or  nearby would be better. Black is in for a
rough ride anyhow.];W[ei];B[ej];W[fj];B[fi];W[dj];B[eh]L[ek]C[PG: 'a' is  better I think. Black has better get out quickly with minimal damage.]
;W[di];B[dh]C[PG: Wrong direction, Black has nothing to gain here.];W[cj]
;B[bj];W[bi];B[ch];W[bk];B[bl];W[al];B[bh];W[aj];B[jq]C[PG: Suicidal. The C12  group is in danger and this stone is lost in the middle of a white ocean.]
;W[eq]L[ij]C[PG: White should play 'a' both the C12 and the L15 groups  will be under attack.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[mq];W[cr];B[br];W[cq];B[dq];W[ds];B[bq];W[bs];B[an];W[cp]
;B[bp];W[cs];B[ek];W[dl]L[fk]C[PG: 'a' seems ok for  White. See variation B.]

(;B[gq];W[nq]C[PG: small, White missed is chance to  attack the C12 group. F10 is important and should be defended.]

(;W[qd];B[rc];W[pd];B[rd];W[pe];B[qf];W[pf]C[PG: This seems good for White; Black is  squeezed against the side with little prospect for territory while White is  building
a magnificient wall.]))
