Hello!   It would be great if you could give me a review of that game. I played White and lost by 1 point. (We played without komi) That is pretty close, but I think I made some big mistakes. Perhaps you could give me some hints how to improve my play.

Many, many thanks, Joerg (Komu)]PL[B];B[ce];W[pp];B[cp];W[pc]

;B[jc]C[gnik: Usually black plays another move in the corner at D16 or
D18.  Since black hasn't done this, there is a weakness in
the corner, and I would be thinking of how to take advantage
of this (see variation).]
(;W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[ch]
(;W[hc]C[My idea was to build strength, but now this move seems to be too narrow. Maybe
play from the other side??

gnik: I agree that it's too small an extension.  Again pushing at D12 first might help to settle white's shape, before pushing from the
other side.];B[mc];W[qj]C[Is this good??

gnik: The corner stone at Q17 has been approached from one side
and is vulnerable.  So I think I would have tried to strengthen the
Q17 stone first, perhaps at R15.  You should also be thinking about
how to attack the two upper black stones.];B[qe];W[pe]C[gnik: this looks like the right move.]
;B[pf];W[qd];B[oe];W[pd];B[qf]
(;W[jq]C[the corner seems to be not too small, and this is a big move, so I should be content. What do you think??

gnik: The upper right corner looks bad for white.  Getting sealed in, and
allowing the two black groups to connect to each other is very bad.  So I
would continue in the upper right, hoping to split black in two.  Also
perhaps the attach and extend joseki would have been better, (i.e. white
P15 instead of R16.];B[dh]C[gnik: This is a big point for both.]
;W[of]C[gnik: Good!];B[og];W[nf];B[ng];W[ne];B[lf]MA[mg][pg]
[le]C[gnik: blacks shapes look bad, and white is solid.  Now consider
the cutting points, e.g. N13, Q13, M15, etc.];W[ie];B[ob]C[gnik: Good move, since it has two purposes.]
;W[oc];B[je];W[if];B[nb];W[pb];B[ph]C[gnik: The opportunity of a severe attack on black has now
pretty much gone.  I think J15 was perhaps too slow, and
a cut instead would have been better.];W[ok];B[nq];W[np]C[gnik: playing at P3 is really good here, because of the stone at
K3.];B[mp];W[oq];B[no];W[op];B[mq];W[pn]C[Same joseki, but it fits better here, doesn't it?

gnik: white certainly has solid territory here, but the K3 stone
looks very weak.];B[jo]C[Now, that was tricky. I really had no plan, what to play.

gnik: this is a good move by black, and makes use of  his
stones on either side.  It shouldn't be too hard to escape and
make life with K3, but bear in mind that black could gain
a lot of territory on the left side.];W[io]C[I tried that one, no plan behind it. What would be your choice?

gnik: This looks good, I might have done the same, or played
H4.];B[jp];W[ip];B[hq];W[gp]C[gnik: Hmm, connecting at J3 is big, especially since it splits black
up.];B[iq];W[eo]C[Maybe I should have played this point earlier??]
;B[dn];W[en];B[dm];W[fl];B[fg]C[gnik: black J6 or white K6 look good, remember the proverb
"play at the head of two stones".];W[eh]C[gnik: Good response.]
;B[eg];W[dd]C[gnik: At last!  But white E11 looks very big.]

;W[ir]C[gnik: This is a good result for white.];B[lo]C[Black did not play very good in this fight. I trapped some stones. The five stones in the center are not trapped at this moment, aren't they? Would there be a way for Black to escape with them?

gnik: those black stones are not worth much, and probably not worth
black saving them.  Although, white has a weakness at L8 to worry a
bit about if they live.];W[il]C[And is this move therefor wasted?

gnik: It looks like a good move to me, because it is also a ladder
break, so you're making points in sente.];B[fh];W[jf]C[gnik: now we're pretty much into the end game, and you should
be looking around the board for all the big points.  Eg. F2, J18, S12,
E8, B18.  The best ones are the moves that also threaten to remove
eye-space.  Eg. S12 forces black to make life or connect.];B[ke]

Bye, Joerg

gnik: I hope my comments are of some help.  Most of the groups
in this game seemed to live quite easily.  So one thing I would
suggest is to be more severe at dividing the opponents stones
up, and attacking them.  Eg. the upper right, and there was a
move at J3 to divide, although white ended up doing this anyway.

There were also lots of minor clumps of stones that were lost
on both sides, which all added up, and were unnecessary loses.
The only way to prevent this is to be more careful, and concentrate
to the end.  Counting can sometimes help you to be more
concentrated.  If  you knew there was only one point in the
game, you might have been more careful.

Also your timing of moves could have been better, remember the
proverb "urgent before big".  Eg. if you had got the D12 move
in first, it would have been sente, and huge.

Cheers,
