C[Hi, my name is Johanna Tuominen, I'm EGF 1dan from Finland. I added some comments through out the game, hope they help!


P: Hi! Thanks for agreeing to do this review for me. I played as black in this game, and won by .5, which is a bit too close for comfort. I have included a few comments throughout about where I think I messed up, but I'd be happy for any of your thoughts. Particularly, I'm curious about my direction of play. Most of the mistakes I point out in my comments were errors of reading, which I can only correct through training and practice, so I feel that the most useful comments are the strategic kind.
Thanks,];B[pq];W[dc];B[cp];W[qd];B[qo];W[jq]
(;B[hq]TR[jq]C[P: I played in this direction becasue it was a bit wider, and because I'd been seeing dan players do it lately :). My instincts say to approach from the enclosure tho...

JT: This is not wrong. However you must keep in mind that the corner is not secure yet. Naturally white next move is to play honte for the marked stone.]
;W[mq]
(;B[ce]C[JT: I think this is good direction to play.];W[cg]
C[JT: One possible Joseki variation suitable for this situation.
See Variation from this node.]
(;B[ee];W[fd]C[JT: Another Joseki for this situation. See variation.]
(;B[fe];W[gd]TR[cg]C[JT: Common Joseki libraries don't recognize this move but it has been seen in professional games. The idea is to attack against the marked stone. See the variation.]
(;B[eh];W[cj];B[cm];W[pj]LB[oc:A][od:B][ql:C]TR[ce][ee][fe]
[eh]C[JT: I think the upper side / upper right corner is now more important than the right corner. The marked black stones can live in the corner or put pressure for the white two stones and get to the center. A or B would be my choice, and if black gets sente then C.]
(;B[ci]C[P: I felt pretty good about the left side before this, but after this I get a bad result and a weak group. It was too hasty...]
;W[bi];B[ch];W[bh]
(;B[dj]LB[oc:A][nd:C][od:B]TR[ch][eh][ci]C[JT: The problem with this move is that you are connecting the marked stones to your own lower-left corner stones. It is easy for white to create a living group and reduce black left side territory. For instance B14(W), B15(B), C9(W). So maybe the best approach is to seal white into the side, and minimize the damage to black territory and groups. Prefereably in sente so that you will be able to reduce the upper side for instance in A,B,C.

;W[id];B[io]TR[jq][mq]C[P: Is this the right direction for building a moyo?

JT: Yes allthough white move around L13 will do the same for white. 

The move itself is nice, builds moyo and same times puts pressure on the white two marked stones.

Then it will be a battle of moyos. All though white upper right corner is open for invasion/reduction]
(;W[cq]TR[hq]C[P: I don't think this should live. Could you comment on my play for how to kill?

JT: The way it was played is living shape called tripod, which cannot be killed without opponents mistake/tenuki. You can find stuff about the tripod form for instance in Senseis library.
The status of the tripod group depends on how close black stones are. In this case the loose shimari allows the group to live if played like in the game. 

Sometimes the 3-3 move under 3-4 stone is used as a probe hoping to get reduction from side. For instance here while black is defending the corner white could use the aji from the corner to slide under the marked stone.]

;B[hr];W[or];B[pr];W[ko];B[ln];W[hg]LB[kf:A][kg:B]C[JT: For white instead of this move I would have played around A or B. This way white makes myoy to the upper right corner and way to the center. In this case black should reduce the upper right corner and aim to close blacksown moyo afterwards. Reduction first because white moyo is bigger.
