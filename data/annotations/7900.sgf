C[Hi, I'm Anand. I'm about 15kyu on IGS and 12-13kyu on KGS. I played black here. This game was played with 1 min 10/25 byo-yomi on IGS.

All comments you have are welcome. About joseki, direction of play, tactics, strategy. I like to play based on influence and fighting. I especially would like to know how to handle the invasion which White made late in the game.

I felt in this game I outplayed my opponent overall but I often get into time trouble at the end of the byo-yomi period and make stupid 1 move blunders.

Mark: Hi - my name's Mark Schlatter (mschlat on kgs and dgs and about 8-9 kyu).  I'll try to help where I can.  Please note that it's best to review games that _aren't_ blitz --- you are more likely to make the easily correctable mistakes during a blitz game.  The tougher issues persist in non-blitz games.]
;B[pd]C[Lostki: Hi];W[dp]C[anand42: hi];B[pp];W[dc]C[I have been playing nirensei often lately. I like the quick development which it offers.]
;B[de]TR[dp]C[Is the high or low approach better here? I played high to counter the influence of the bottom left white stone.

Mark: I think both are fine, but I do follow your reasoning here --- both of the marked stones can emphasize the center.]
;W[gc]
(;B[cc];W[cd]C[I think this is overplay];B[dd];W[bc]
(;B[cb]C[Mark: Okay, this is a question of direction.  You have chosen to fight early over the corner (and you end up losing).  Why not play to separate the white stones?  (See the variation.)]
;W[bb]
(;B[db]C[Mark: With this move, you've committed to killing to survive or make a profit --- and it's very difficult.]

[jp:A][fq:B]SQ[bd][be][bf]C[Mark: Okay, let's reflect here.  Over the last few moves, you've ensured that the marked stones will probably live.  (They're not part of a living group yet, but there's hope.)  Saving those stones is worth maybe nine points (six points for the captured stones plus the three points of territory on the first line).

That's not a lot of points.  You need to consider the big moves left on the board (A, B, C) --- all of those have the potential for more profit.  Don't feel compelled to play in an area just because your opponent does.]

(;B[cq]C[This invasion worked out well...any other suggestions?]
;W[dq];B[cp]
(;W[cr];B[bo];W[do];B[bn];W[fp];B[gq]LB[ql:B][fm:D][jq:C][nq:A]
C[Should I be saving this stone at all? Or should I play somewhere else?

Mark: I'd say elsewhere.  This stone is very close to White thickness and thus has limited power.  There are still big moves at A, B, C, and D.]
;W[fr];B[jq];W[gr];B[hq]C[Mark: You are focusing on saving two stones.  Saving these might affect white's chances for life, but your opponent can still move to the corner to save the group.  Look to bigger areas.]
;W[dj]C[What do you think of the way I handled this wedge?

Mark: Well, you have the problem that both of your groups are still not alive (although they do have room to run).  Your best approach is to attack the white stone and add stability to one or both of the groups.]
;B[ck]LB[fh:A][fj:C][em:B]C[Mark: There's a proverb --- "don't touch a weak stone".  In this case, you've touched (on the diagonal) a white stone with no support (so it's clearly weak).  As a result, white is able to build a strong framework in your territory.

Another idea would be moves like A, B, or C.  You dare white to live inside a small area while you give support to your groups on the left.]
;W[el];B[dk]LB[cj:B][ek:A]C[The waist cut at A didn't work.

Mark: I much prefer B here over A.  At least with B, you link up the two left groups and ensure some side territory.  This move emphasizes fighting, but I don't see the potential profit.]
;W[ek];B[ej];W[cj];B[ei];W[cl];B[bk];W[bl];B[bj];W[dl]C[Mark: Notice how white has separated the two black groups and gained sente (since the bottom left is not alive).]
;B[br];W[bq];B[bp];W[bs];B[aq];W[er];B[ar];W[dn]C[Mark: A very small move by white....]
;B[pj]C[Mark: .... so you take the big point on the board.  Great move!]
;W[ae];B[jj]C[I make a big framework. I think I'm leading big at this point.White is overconcentrated at the bottom. The top is not entirely secure. I manage to reduce it later.

Mark: Again, a good move.  Keep in mind, however, that both right corners are open for invasion.]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[Blocked on wider side.];W[pq];B[oq]
(;W[bh];B[bg];W[ci];B[bi];W[or];B[nq]C[double hane better? I just played a normal line since the wall was useful

Mark: No, I agree --- the wall is wonderful.  If white lives, it's still much less profit than what you make.]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[rn]C[How to handle this invasion?

Also, is the bottom group alive?

Mark: I think your move is fine --- you separate the stones.  I'm less concerned about whether white lives or not.  They clearly need several more moves to survive, and you can take profit if they make those moves.]
;B[rp];W[rj]C[I think now I can kill the bottom group?

Mark: I've put some ideas below --- I think white can survive.]
(;B[rl]LB[qh:B][rh:A]C[Mark: This isn't a bad idea, but I think A or B do a better job of confining the white stones.]
;W[qh];B[rr]LB[pc:A][of:C][ph:B]SQ[nc][kd][qh][rj]C[Mark: Okay, let's take stock --- the marked white stones are starting to threaten the upper right corner.  You don't have much of a base, and a 3-3 invasion is a possibility.  At this point, I think you are better off controlling the R12/S10 stones or securing the corner.

A does a good job of taking the corner (and preparing for to attack the loose frame work on the top.  B is an agressive fighting move, while C attacks from afar (and is my favorite).  I think all of them address the more pressing issue of the upper right corner.]
;W[qr]
(;B[mr]C[Is this necessary to kill?

Mark: I believe so, yes.]
(;W[oh]LB[rn:B][pq:A]C[I thought if I could just kill the bottom groups A and B it will be enough to win.Here again I was in time trouble. Any suggestions welcome.

Mark: Note that B is not a group, it's just a stone (and being so close to the bottom wall, almost powerless).  A is a bigger issue, but I don't see it as large as the influence white is building in the upper right.]
;B[qk];W[pn];B[nj];W[nn];B[pb]LB[lc:B][ne:E][of:D][mh:C][oh:A]
C[He has two weak and one dead groups. I was worried about my corner. Was this necessary? Should I have attacked group A? How?

I also thought it was sente against top side to invade at B maybe?

Mark: Ways to attack group A --- take away the running directions.  C, D, and E are all possible attacks that also strengthen the upper right corner (well, at least E and D do).  In other words, you gain sente while building up defense.

Yes, Q18 sets up possible invasions, but that's a few moves away --- I'd rather do "two purpose" (attack and defense) moves.]
;W[lj]
(;B[ni]C[Mark: I think this is too small a move --- see the variation.]
;W[nh]
(;B[mh]C[Mark: See the variations --- I'm not sure this hane serves you well.]
;W[of]
(;B[oe];W[mg];B[qe]LB[me:B][ne:A]C[This was a last-ditch time trouble averting wasted move to get through the byo-yomi period.

Mark: Which sadly yields nothing.  At this point, I think of two helpful instincts: "don't get surrounded" and "separate the stones".  A or B serve you better.]
;W[ne];B[nd];W[md];B[od];W[lh]
(;B[mi]SQ[nn][pn][rn]C[Mark: Is saving the stone that important?  It doesn't appear to affect your group or white's (who appears to be connected).  Better to leave it and make sure you enclose the marked area.]
;W[li]
(;B[mk]LB[ml:A][nl:B]C[Mark: I like A or B better.  I tested A below and am somewhat concerned about the cut.]
;W[kl];B[ln]SQ[ll][ml][lm][mm]C[Mark: A move like this means you know you can handle the possible cuts (marked).  In this case, that's probably doable by killing the three white stones.  I'd feel more comfortable with N7 and just running the group out while applying pressure.]
;W[ml];B[mm]LB[ll:B][nl:A]C[Mark: A good choice ---- I tested A and B and did not see success.]
(;W[lm];B[nl];W[lk];B[mn];W[nm];B[ol]C[I thought taking the ko was risky...I'm usually afraid of ko fights, don't know why.

Mark: Well, the best way to lose the fear is go ahead and try them.  However, this move does build eyespace for the black group, so it's fine.]
;W[pl]
(;B[om]C[Mark: I don't think this move helps --- first, if white pushes, your group is still safe (see variations).  Second, your O10 group is surrounded.  You want to hold on to liberties for that group as long as possible until you kill Q6.  Pushing from the inside removes those liberties.  Focus on the outside liberties first.]
;W[kn]
(;B[on]C[Mark: Same idea here --- an outside push at N5 works better.]

;B[gi]LB[dg:B][in:C][rq:A]SQ[hc][ic][jc][hd][id][jd]C[Mark: You don't have to respond where your opponent just played.  After all, you just said you can reduce.  The big remaining area left is the large top.  I think a reducing move in the marked area might work.  You need to be able to run to B or C.]

Mark: Still small moves --- focus on the large areas.];W[hl]
;B[jk]C[Mark: So what are these three stones doing?  You're not connected to anything.  Better to emphasize the top or the cut at M13.]

;W[kb];B[nb];W[lc];B[mb];W[gf]LB[de:A]C[The moyo boundary is much bigger now.

Mark: Yep --- you just have reducing moves from A left.]

;W[ee];B[hc]C[This was the sequence I'd been waiting for...with E12 it would've worked. I was winning by about 20 points even without this I think.

You can ignore the rest of the game...time trouble big blunders.

Mark: I made one comment later on, but that's it.  I hope this was helpful.  A few general suggestions:

1) Get used to looking at the whole board and identifying large areas --- the move you made in the center and the middle right were good.  Build on moves like those.

2) Don't just play where your opponent played and try to play away from their strengths.

3) Both 1) and 2) are easier in non-blitz games :-).
