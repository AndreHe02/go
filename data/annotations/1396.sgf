C[I played W in this game, and feel that I was outplayed by my opponent.  I hope that a review of this game will reveal some mistakes in positional judgement (direction of play) and also point out opportunities to improve my fighting tactics.]

(;W[qn]C[MP: This way of playing has the advantage that it is a one-way road.]
;B[nq];W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[no];W[pm];B[mp]C[At this point I worried that B's stones were working too well to make a large territory at the bottom.  Did W error in choosing the small avalanch joseki?  I deemed it unproductive to invade the bottom at this time, but was vexed as to how to handle the situation.

MP: You have sente and komi, so it is still a fairly even game. I would not worry too much, at this stage.  It is urgent to stop black from making a big moyo, but otherwise it is not a lost game. It often easy to lose one's head in the opening - because a position looks bad. But often this is imagination.  I am too weak to tell if this is an even game or not. I would play on as it were even.]
;W[do]C[I feared B would attach at E5, but I played here anyway, because I couldn't think of a better move.

MP: If B attach at E5 Your left side will take the same proportion as Blacks lower side. Your side will not be as solid as Black's but then you are thicker on the right side still.

Black should of course get a lot of points on the lower side - but on the rest of the board there is only one black stone.]
;B[fp]
(;W[fo]C[MP: This move may help black to get solid territory]
;B[go]C[This is natural but playing an ordinary extension on 4th line may be good as well.]
;W[gp]C[Picking a fight here is a little unwise considering the black thickness to the right.]

(;B[ep]C[This is a bad move and is probably the reason why White get away with this unreasonable play.]

(;W[kr]C[Would W F3 have been a better move than L2 ?]
(;B[lr];W[js];B[eo]C[I guess both players thought that W was alive on the bottom, but I wonder if that's true.

MP: I think it is alive now. White E2 was a good move that helps a lot. But it do look like a typical "hard" life & death problem.]
;W[en];B[dn];W[dm];B[cn];W[el];B[co];W[jm]C[W was pleased at this point, as though he came out with better shape than he deserved.  I wonder how a stronger player would evaluate the whole board position at this point.  Should W regret  making a small life a the bottom?

MP: Black has 17 + 17 points on the bottom side. That is 34 points.  It is hard to evaluate the position now because there are three weak groups in the center now. Since two of them are White it should be good for black.]

(;B[gk];W[ej];B[ik]C[MP: This feels slow.]
(;W[mm]TR[on][pm]C[MP: This is an extension from thick stones, thus it feels bad]

(;B[lm]C[MP:  Black can cut. But there is no reason to do it right now. See the variation for a simple way of playing that cannot be bad for black.]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[kl];B[il];W[ll];B[hi]TR[jk]C[I felt B should atari at K10 here.  Since he did not, I took that point myself.

MP: K10 is not sente now. It is simple not doing any work. If you play elsewhere and Black plays two moves to capture it you get two more free big moves elsewhere.]
;W[jj]C[Is this big or would it be better to play elsewhere?

MP: It is better to play elsewhere if there is a good reason for it can be played later.]
;B[ml]
(;W[mn]LB[kk:a]C[MP: This look good but it leaves a cut at 'a' for later.]

[pg:c][nc:d][jd:e]C[Here W felt it was time to take a big point, but where?  Or is there a strong move to pressure B's group in the center?

MP: I think 'a', 'b' and 'c' are natural. I would prefer 'e' to 'd']

(;W[jd];B[ch];W[dh];B[bi];W[bj];B[aj];W[cg];B[bg];W[bf]C[MP: Here I would play another of the big points on the right side. Since black can invade the upper left corner anyway it is not urgent to play here.]

Still in a game where I am behind and do not have a good plan, I often try to play for maximum gain. If you are lucky the oppenent will try an attack that fails and gives you some extra points. If it succeds... well then it is a good time to resign. (This was not an advice more a description of how I reason sometimes)]

MP:
It was hard to find any moves that were clear mistakes in this game. But I hope that some of the ideas I proposed can be some food for thought.

The most common mistake in this game was perhaps a tendency to play slow moves rather than playing bad moves.

If there is a lesson in this it is that one must always consider the whole board and not become to attached to the last moves played.]
