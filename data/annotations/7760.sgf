;B[pq]C[Hello Andy.
My name is Timo and I`ll try to make a good review for you.

Your question about the center: I am sure that problem it is very common at your kyu level.
I had the same two.
But...lets start:];W[dd];B[qd];W[dp];B[cj];W[oc];B[cg];W[qo]

(;W[sn]TR[rm]C[I`m sure that move cant be a good one.
Playing on the first line so early in game.

Sure, his response kills yout marked stone, but anyway, see V.]
;B[rn];W[qn];B[ro];W[rp];B[sm];W[on]C[I like my response more, but P6 is a good move.
Aiming to run away, the bottom group is still very weak.];B[oe]

But to be honest, I never played it myself and dont know much about ist, sorry.]

Its not alway bad, but its rarely the best. See V];B[eo];W[ep]

But your group in the upper left should not be forgotten.];B[me]

But the Idea is right, invading.

;B[gc];W[eb];B[fe];W[lk];B[nj];W[kh];B[go];W[gp];B[fo]C[Maybe here you could ignore his move.]
(;W[fp];B[ir];W[hr];B[iq];W[hq];B[gj]C[Well, we don`t like tha black stone formation on the left.
The big wall on the bottom and the very bit, possibly territory!
Perhaps its time to play more aggressive.

Not sure there is a way that it could work.
But its worth trying.]

I didnt comment the most moves you did in the middle, because I think, most of them werent very bad :)

But you should have played where black played now somewhen.

[ss]C[Okay.
Hard loss :(

But that doesnt matter, you made some quite good moves in the middle-game!
I would do some life and death problems, you should find a lot of them free and legal online.

Probably the next tip sucks but: Play, play play.
Try new moves, try new openings.
Your aim for a good-balance middle and on-the-wall territory is too much at first I think.
Although you did well in this game.
The black group on the left was too big too invade, when noticed.

An, what really helps:
Review your games yourself, thinking you are doing it for someone else.
Go deep. Rethink almost every move.

Also ingame: Even if a move seems to be very usual, think about it(I dont just say it,it often happens to me)

I hope I could help you a little bit,
dont worry, youre 10-12k very soon :)

Best regards,
Timo])
