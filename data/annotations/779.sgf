GC[Comments by Georg Mischler ("schorsch" on nngs)]

C[Hello. My name is Xinjia and my email is xinjia@china.com. I feel I played my best in this game and it was very close.  --xinjia on IGS

Hi :)
my name is Georg Mischler. I currently play 2k in germany and about 2-3k on nngs (not rated because I don't play enough).
I tried my best commenting this game, though I probably overlooked a lot of stuff anyway.
If you have any questions, you can find me as "schorsch" on nngs.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[ed];W[df];B[cc]C[This suprised me as I had not seen it before

*schorsch*:
Better remember it then, this is a very common joseki :)];W[bc]
C[*schorsch*:
"a" (b B16), however, is not the usual continuation. the "b" varation (b D17) is the joseki sequence.]

(;B[bd]C[*schorsch*:
the black move at B16 is unusual and can make the situation very complicated. I wouldn't want to calculate all the possible variations.

To simplify the result, maybe "b" (w C15) would be the right answer. Although it may look defensive at first, it basically gets us back to joseki shape, which is never a bad idea.]

(;W[dc]C[Should this be played at b15? I thought it was a mistake but it turned out OK in the end.]
;B[cb];W[be]C[*schorsch*:
Still, C15 might be better (kind of magic move, eh? ;).
That way w can either connect D17 or extend to B18. In fact, the connection (seperating b!) is much more interesting than to save a single stone in the corner.]
;B[dd]C[*schorsch*:
Again, "a" (w A16) should be at "b" (w C15). This would settle your group after giving up D17 so you don't need the last securing move (w D15) at the end of your sequence. It may cost you one or two points in the corner if b plays B18, but this is not interesting so early in the game. If b still insists to capture the D17 stone, then w gets sente and can play elsewhere.]

(;W[ad];B[ec];W[db]C[*schorsch*:
Why sacrifice another stone, and help b to build a rock-solid position?]
;B[eb];W[bb];B[da];W[de]C[*schorsch*:
The last few moves (except w D15) are not needed at this moment, since they only make a few points for w, while strengthening the b position a lot.
There's no need for b to worry about his group anymore now!
As a consequence, the next b move gets HUGE!];B[jd]C[Good, I was hoping he wouldnt invade around c9 or so

*schorsch*:
b K16 was perfect, taking the maximum profit out of the strength built up in the corner.
there's still time to invade if there should be a need. The next move by w will be gote, and still leave b in a favourable position.]
;W[cj]C[*schorsch*:
Looke at the position now:
The left and top sides are about equally occupied by w and b, while b still has another stone in the bottom right corner. And it's b's move!

The fight at the top left corner left w two moves beind in the game. b must make some mistakes later to still lose this game.]
;B[qk]C[Isnt that the chinese fuseki? Whats he trying to pull :)

*schorsch*:
If I was b, I'd try to play somewhere at the bottom, to keep w from extending too far from the left side.]
;W[jp];B[po]C[*schorsch*:
b Q5 may be too defensive.
The two b stones in the corner build influence towards the bottom center, which w will neutralise with the next move. It does make some territory, but helps w to make some as well.]
;W[mp]C[*schorsch*:
Imagine the last two moves exchanged (b at N4 and w at Q5).
Which position would each player prefer?
This may be hard to see at your strength, but is an important concept  in the fuseki. If you can seperate your opponents groups, while keeping stable positions for your own stones, do so. Of course, the judgement of the "stable" attribute may not allways be easy...]
;B[nn];W[gp];B[md];W[qf]C[I think this is the best reducing move. However it is really more of an invasion, thank goodness it was as successful as it was, as we shall see...

*schorsch*:
Maybe this should have come at least one move earlier, especially since the bottom left corner still allows the 3x3 invasion even after w G4. Now b has taken even more profit from his top left strength.]
;B[qe];W[qi];B[pf];W[rf];B[qg]C[*schorsch*:
The w invasion cannot be killed reasonably, so why try?
Closing the corner around S15 (J15?) would be far more important. And if b later gets the chance to play somewhere around H15, then that might secure around 40 points up there.

Yes, b allmost killed w later, but only because of a w mistake.
If b closes the corner, w should walk out into the center with his group, so b basically gets sente.]
;W[rg];B[qh];W[rd]C[*schorsch*:
The right direction to reduce b territory, but too early. w needs S12 first to live.]
;B[re];W[se];B[rc]C[Aha!

*schorsch*:
b probably wants R16 instead, in order to close the top territory and to keep the w group small.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[qc];B[rb];W[qb]C[*schorsch*:
w Q17 might be more interesting here, but S12 is of course still the most urgent move.]
;B[rh]C[*schorsch*:
As we see...];W[sf];B[pc];W[ob];B[pb];W[pa];B[nb]C[At this point I decided to go for the corner, I didnt think I could save all the stones :)

*schorsch*:
Actually, at this moment, w might die even with S19... (b T18 kills).]
;W[ra];B[oc];W[sb]C[*schorsch*:
ufff.... Say thanks to b :)];B[oa];W[cp]C[I think this was a good move, actually maybe I should have done it earlier?

*schorsch*:
Yes, this is very big. Though, looking at the situation now, G4 might have been more stable at G3.]
;B[ln];W[op]C[just to make sure he doesent try something funny if I just defend]
;B[pp];W[oo];B[on]C[*schorsch*:
The last two moves by w have forced b to solidify his position, whithout really helping w very much (just a few small points).]
;W[or];B[oq]C[was p2 a mistake on my part?

*schorsch*:
Yes, if you want to play around here at all, then P3 would work best.]
;W[np];B[pr]C[I was hoping he didnt move on o3

*schorsch*:
If w plays at O2 next instead of O3, then we don't need to sacrifice P2. On the other hand, w O3 keeps sente for w.]
;W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[os];W[jn];B[ff]C[*schorsch*:
To answer the question from a few moves later: Yes, K9 is probably one of the biggest moves now. It serves two very important purposes: to reduce the b influence from top right, and to build a mojo at left.
Maybe J9 would emphasize territory a little more.]
(;W[ri]C[Just a prod first.. aiming to run out into the centre and cause some trouble

*schorsch*:
As you'll find, there is no way to run (if b plays right)];B[pi]
;W[sh]
(;B[ph]C[*schorsch*:
Why does b play at Q12?
R10 might even capture the two w stones, at least it will force w to connect in gote (there are 3 cuts!).
Check the variation one move earlier.

There is no danger for the b Q11 stone at all, as it can walk out to the center any time (and make territory on the way!).]
;W[rk];B[rl];W[qj];B[pj];W[sk];B[ql]C[*schorsch*:
Both players have been very generous here.
b by allowing w to make another eye, and leaving the right edge open.
w by not playing R8 instead of T9.];W[jk]C[This is the move I was considering before I saw s11, what was worth more initially, s11 or k9?

*schorsch*:
S11 was worth about 10 points, while K9 (J9?) may be worth 20 or more. Just estimate the additional  b territory when b plays L8 and the profit w could make now, and add them both to get an idea.]
;B[sl]C[*schorsch*:
Very urgent for b, and sente in the game. On the other hand, w might want to give away a few stones, and play, well.... F9? F10? something in that area anyway.
Again a negotiation between saving about 15 points (6 stones die), vs. securing 20 or more.
The variation at "b" (w F10) just shows an example continuation, you can immeditatly see what this does to the left side territory, and the situation in the center.]

(;W[sj];B[eh];W[di]C[Trying to stop him from getting in too close

*schorsch*:
Why defend the 5-10 points at left? the corner is alive, and the big points will be made below E9.
w E9 (or E10) would be the points to play.];B[il]C[Hmm

*schorsch*:
Yes, K9 may be a little loose. I suggested J9 earlier, but maybe K8 would have been even more solid.
Hmmm, think about having played w K9 at w J8, and given away 5 stones at right for w F9... W could just ignore b E13 then and extend his territory into the center.]
;W[eg]C[*schorsch*:
Isn't w helping b to built territory this way? It turns out that both profit in the end, but maybe K8 would be more interesting now.]
;B[fg];W[fh];B[gh];W[fi];B[jl]C[*schorsch*:
I think b would better play L7 first, to get a connection there (and disconnect w).]
;W[km];B[kl];W[lm];B[gi];W[fj];B[gj];W[gk];B[gl]C[Oops... but for who? I think I was lucky to push this as far as I did, as we shall see :)

*schorsch*:
All this mess starting here in the center is pretty hard to comment. I think b should prefer to play H9, in order to close up his territory. He can still try to walk into the w area after that (L5, M2, M3, M4,J6 and G8 might become interesting points, depending on w's answer).]
;W[hk];B[hl];W[fk];B[mm]C[*schorsch*:
A very small move by b.
What about going for a walk inside w's territory instead (now that most of the center is lost for b anyway)?]
;W[ll];B[kk];W[ik];B[kn];W[jm];B[lp];W[ko];B[lo];W[lq];B[kp]
;W[kq];B[jo];W[io];B[ko]C[Future attack at o5 for ko threats? or try it now?

*schorsch*:
There are approach problems for both players. Check out what happens when b plays K3 and then K2 (L1?), especially after the w liberties N5 and N6 are gone.]
;W[lj];B[kj];W[lk];B[ki];W[ii];B[ih];W[lh];B[li];W[mi];B[kh]
;W[ni];B[lg];W[mg];B[mh];W[nh];B[lh]C[*schorsch*:
b rather wants to play N15 here, connecting the ko is worth nothing.]
;W[nf];B[mf];W[me];B[ng];W[og];B[le];W[mg];B[ne];W[pg]C[attacking the r12 group

*schorsch*:
Not really...];B[ok];W[nk];B[nl];W[oj];B[mk];W[mj];B[nj];W[hh]

;B[mo]C[*schorsch*:
He who laughs last, laughs best :)];W[mq];B[nj]C[*schorsch*:
Pity b doesn't see K3...];W[hn]C[I think protecting here is good now, before I might have been able to escape.

Actually looking things over after the game, this was probably an oversight I didnt do it earlier, then again, all that pushing I did could have been used to connect over his running group, no?

*schorsch*:
As long as the w dragon has enough liberties, w F6 (E6?) may be more interesting, as it also closes up the left area.
Still, K3 is deadly, and no, I don't hink that the b dragon could be captured. The pushing by w just reduced b territory, which was enough to balance the game again.
If b had realised his how much he was ahead around move 95, he could have played much more peaceful, just securing his territory and carrying his advantage to the end.]

C[*schorsch*:
ufffffff.... what was b dreaming all the time? ;)];B[ef];W[dg]
;B[ba];W[ng]C[This is pretty much the endgame now, just trying to grap a point here or there wherever I can]
;B[ij];W[jj];B[ji];W[hj];B[ii];W[im];B[ee];W[hm]C[*schorsch*:
In the endgame we need to care about single points. The last two moves by w just invested two stones to get one point. Not very effective when there are still several full point moves around.]
;B[ml];W[ms];B[ns];W[of];B[oe];W[qa];B[ca];W[ab];C[The end.

Thanks for watching.. hope u enjoyed the show. As previously stated I am reachable at xinjia@china.com. Also please send me some games to comment on, I think it would be fun.
"The beginner can forsee the result at the cost of a little trouble. White leads by 1.5" (hehe, always wanted to say that) --xinjia


Lucky w :)
As allways, stronger players may disagree, but I hope I addressed the most important issues in commenting this game.
Have fun and keep improving!

(;W[fj];B[il];W[gl];B[jl];W[km];B[kl];W[lm]C[*schorsch*:
w's profit at left would at least be the 15 points we lost at right, but we are now in a much better position to walk into the center and chase the three b stones. Maybe b wouldn't want to put those there in this case anyway, but we're wildly speculating now...
your mileage may vary :)]))
(;B[qj];W[rj];B[rk];W[si];B[sk];W[sd]C[*schorsch*:
b must not atari now, it would not change anything but remove a ko threat for later use.
Let's just play a big sente move now, like...];B[kl]C[*schorsch*:
If we estimat the score now, then b is still about 20 points ahead.
There would be some struggle about a few points left of the center, but any reduction or increase in territory would be mutual. b even has some tricks to pull, eg. around M3.]
))
(;W[jk];B[fi];W[oi]))
(;W[ce];B[eb];W[cj]C[*schorsch*:
Just an example move, that makes use of the stones just played, could probably be anywhere to attack another corner.]
))
(;W[ce]C[*schorsch*:
Three possible moves here for b.
"a" (b B18) is agressive, and probably not very good for b.
"b" (b C18) goes for maximum territory.
"c" (b D17) is save, and is the closest to the joseki situation.]

(;B[bb]C[*schorsch*:
Now w can punish b for not playing joseki, and cut off the b corner.]
;W[dc];B[cb];W[dd];B[eb];W[db];B[da];W[ec];B[fb];W[fc]C[*schorsch*:
b makes allmost no points in the corner, while w gets huge influence towards the center and the left edge.]
)
(;B[cb];W[bb];B[ec];W[ci];B[ic]C[*schorsch*:
b gets some more points in the corner than with joseki, but ends up in gote. Now is the time for w to make a big move somewhere.]
)
(;B[dc];W[bb];B[ic];W[ci]C[*schorsch*:
The last move comes a little shorter than in the joseki, taking account for the aji caused by the black cutting stone. But we allready have the corner now, so it should still be a fair outcome. The corner stone (w B18) could become the basis for a monkey jump (w D19 or E19) in the endgame (not before!), which is worth about 5, resp. 8 points.]
)))
(;B[dc];W[be];B[ic]C[*schorsch*:
Sometimes b plays K17, which is not quite as stable.
W may tenuki here if there is another very urgent move waiting somewhere, as "a" (around C10) or "b" (B18) are miai to live. But then, "a" makes the best use of the great strength of the corner, and the joseki emphasizes territory.]
