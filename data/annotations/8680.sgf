AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hi,

it was one of my first games against a human player since a year and i just want to know what kind of mistakes i made and how I can improve
my go. I would be very happy if I could get some helpful advices. I'm  still a beginner and i think that i did very well against this 2k player.

------------------------

Hello,

My name is Hannes, and I will review for Black.

Accidentally, my last game on KGS showed the same basic flaw I see in Black's thinking, here. So my thanks go to my friend A. for pointing this out to me.

What I am referring to - in all brevity as it will be spelled out in detail, later - is that Black, while engaging in local fights, forgets about some basic strategic and tactical principles.

Attack/Defense:

- in a handicap game (the higher the handicap, the more) Black needs to keep the situation simple, while White will try to make things complicated

- as a rule of thumb, try to keep your groups connected (if possible try to separate your oponent's)

Direction of play:

- if a wall may emerge from an operation, make sure it faces the right direction

- don't press your opponent against a weak group of yours];W[fq]
;B[eq]LB[cc:D][cm:A][fp:E][mp:B][dq:C]C[H: 

This move is not a real mistake, but in general, Black should avoid close fights. He has plenty of opportunity to play non-contact. even non-agressive moves that are of equal, if not of higher value, e.g.

A: nicely connecting his handicap stones while strengthening his corner stone's position

B: building larger frameworks

C: blocking without creating an immediate fight

D: even securing a corner makes certain sense, as it makes good use of the main advantage, Black has, which is the handicap stones.

It also ignores the rule of thumb that contact moves tend to make the oponent stonger.

Lastly, White E will result in bad shape.];W[fp];B[er]LB[cc:F]
[cm:D][co:A][cp:B][mp:E][hq:C][fr:G]C[H:

Not sure what this move is played for.

If it's about securing the corner, playing at A or B would have done the trick much better. (Yes, A and B are somewhat "slow", but then again, this is the advantage of playing with handicap: Black can choose secure, solid connections over more promising, but fragile ones.)

Other than that, this move hardly enlarges Black's territory, nor does it attack White severely.

It even invites White to play G resulting in a stong white wall.

Black's alternatives besides A and B:

C: Extending while putting pressure on White

D,E,F as in move #2];W[fr];B[cm]C[H:

Good move, could just have been more early.];W[kq];B[jq]LB[jj:B]
[pj:D][fp:A][kp:F][pp:C][jq:E][kq:G]C[H: 

If this were a local fight, there is some value in this move, as it separates the two white groups.

However,  here we have two circumstances that matter:

1) The White wall at A

2) The black handicap stones at B, C, D

First of all, E will result in a wall facing the White A wall, which eliminates the influence that Black's wall could have had.

Additionally, any of Whites reactions to E will separate the E group from C.

As a consequence, Black presses White to separate himself (Black) by creating a wall that has no power.


Consider the alternative: playing at F:
- Will result in a wall that faces the handicap stones at B and D
- Allows for more easily connecting the F group with the black corner stone at C

I can understand that Black E looks tempting as F seems to allow white for getting immediate territory on the lower side, however, expanding white G on the third line (i.e. to the left or right of G) does give only very little territory, and it entails that white is cut off from extending into the center.]
;W[nq];B[oq]LB[cg:D][qm:C][jp:A][kp:E][pq:B]C[H:

Not a bad move in general, putting some pressure on white.

But again, it forces white to strenghten his group which, in turn, makes the Black A group weaker.

Better alternatives:
- E for the reasons given before (black wall facing the black handicap stones, building influence into the center while "sealing white in" at the bottom side)

- B: securing the corner without making contact

- C and D extending/strenghtening the Black moyo];W[np];B[or]
LB[er:A]C[H:

Same problem as A: no real profit for Black, White's group will become stronger]
;W[nr];B[qm]C[H:

Good (better, if played before)];W[ho];B[jm]LB[jn:A]C[H:

Overplay. The one-space jump (A) is the typical move in order to "run into the open/center" with less danger of being cut off.]
;W[cf];B[ch]LB[cd:C][dd:A][ch:D][dj:B]C[H:

As Black A is weaker than B, attacking from the top would have been better: D pushes white against the weak A stone.

Following the idea that Black can afford to play slower, but more secure moves, not attacking at all, but playing Black C  would have been even better.]
;W[jn];B[jo];W[kn]
(;B[in]LB[kn:A][lo:B]C[H:

I guess Black has misread this situation. After white A, Black should know that he will be cut off immediately.

B might have been a more promising alternative although I doubt that Black is able to escape at all (cf. variations).]
;W[io];B[im];W[lo];B[nm];W[gm];B[gl]LB[qg:A][em:B][lm:C]C[H:

Unnecessary contact move again. 

(Very) Big alternatives:

- A extending the Black framework on the right
- B extending the Black framework on the lower left
- C in order to keep white from pushing upwards];W[fm];B[fl]
;W[el];B[em]C[H:

It's White's aim to create compicated situations. No need for Black to help him.]
;W[ek];B[dm];W[ej];B[hl];W[eo]C[H:

Now, White aims at eye space for his group.];B[en]LB[en:A][fo:B]
[hq:C]C[H:

Not bad, A makes B a false eye.

But note that the most space is around C. Playing there would destroy a lot of potential eye space. So this should be played first.

Cf. variations on move #40];W[fn]
(;B[do];W[ir];B[df]LB[df:A][ej:B]C[H:

Correct direction of play: if A results in a vertical black wall, that faces the black handicap stones. It's not perfect, as the white B group still has some influence in the same direction.]
;W[dk];B[cj];W[ck];B[bk]LB[ge:D][dh:A][eh:B][ek:C]C[H: 

Close fighting again. 

Black should rather play solidly, leaving White the task to try to make territory/life.

Alternatives:
- Solidly connecting at A
- More loosely connecting at B, shielding the white C group from the area around D]
;W[bl];B[bj];W[cl];B[bm];W[al];B[am];W[eh];B[gf]LB[dg:A][ch:B]
[cj:C]C[H:

Black misreads the possible cut at A that suddenly makes his B/C stones struggle for life.

In the following sequence, Black does well at saving his stones (at the cost of destroying his framework in this area).

(No comment until #70)];W[dg];B[cg];W[di];B[ce];W[bf];B[be]
;W[ci];B[bi];W[ef];B[dh];W[eg];B[bg];W[de];B[af];W[df]
(;B[ah]LB[af:B][ch:D][bi:C][ei:A]C[H:

Black does not need to create eyes immediately. Connecting with the corner stones by playing B is enough for his C/D groups. 

Capturing at A would have been better, here, as it creates cutting points for separating the white group (cf. variation).]
;W[ed];B[ei]C[H:

Here comes the split, but Black does not follow up (cf. alternatives to #76).]
;W[fi];B[di];W[fj]
(;B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[cb];W[ea];B[db];W[gc]TR[jd][pd]
[jj][pj][nm][qm]C[H:

Here's where we are now:

- the lower left is Black's territory
- the lower right is as well
- the lower side is White's
- the upper left is Black's
- the upper right quarter of the board is untouched by White while black has four to six stones (triangled) there to help him.

White still has the role of an attacker while Black can play more slowly and securely...]
;B[hc]LB[mc:B][jg:C][qg:A][fh:E][hi:D]C[H:

Instead, Black attacks with a contact move again. I won't repeat the advice against, here.

Better alternatives:
- A, B, C: strengthening the black framework, connecting the starpoint stones
- D: preventing white access to the upper right
- E: cutting white];W[kk]LB[ik:B][hl:D][im:C][km:A]C[H:

Looks like an overplay, but if white succeeds in cutting around A plus gets a wall in the direction of B, the C/D group can get into trouble.

So I think Black A makes sense, but Black needs to defend against White B.]
;B[km];W[lm];B[ll]LB[kk:A]C[H:

This makes sense, separating White's stones.];W[kl];B[ml]C[H:

Good thinking again.];W[jk];B[lj]LB[ik:A][hl:C][im:B]C[H:

This is the mistake.

A is the crucial point that allows White to cut off the black B/C group.]
;W[ik];B[hj];W[ij];B[ii];W[ji];B[kj];W[hi];B[ih];W[hk];B[ki]
;W[gj]LB[mc:A][pc:C][qg:B]C[H:

White succeeded in making more points, but the general situation still favors Black: the whole upper right is still without a single white stone. And it is a big framework/moyo. It would still be huge, even if white should be able to live small in the corner, or on the sides.

A, B, C are some options open to Black.];B[gh]LB[gh:A][hl:B]
[jm:C]C[H:

Not sure what Black aims for, here. 

- If the goal is to enlarge the black territory, this gives only one additional point. Any of the alternatives mentioned before (move #103) is far more valuable.

- If the goal is to cut off white, or to destroy his eyes, then Black forgets that his B/C group is already dead.]
;W[fh];B[hg]C[H:

One more unnecessary local move instead of caring for the most relevant part of the board: the upper right black framework.]
;W[lp]C[H:

Unnecessary in my eyes];B[kr];W[jr];B[no]C[H:

Endgame move. Not urgent. Upper right still not strengthened.]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[op];B[oo]LB[po:A][pq:B]C[H:

This Black move creates two cutting points for white. 

Black A would have been the more secure (though defensive) defense.]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[qq];B[qr]LB[qq:A][qr:B]C[H:

It's all about counting liberties, here.

Black follows this idea for some moves pretty well.

White A group: 2 liberties,
Black B group: 4 liberties];W[rq];B[rr]C[H:

White: 3 liberties, black 5 (plus some additional benefit from the corner)]
;W[ro]
(;B[qo]TR[rn][so][qp][sp][sq]TB[bh][ci]C[H:

If white connects: 5 liberties (cf. triangles)
Black: 5 liberties

As it is White's move, he can start taking Black's liberties and Black will loose the race.

Cf. variations];W[rn];B[rm];W[sr];B[pn]LB[qn:A]C[H:

Black A would have been the better blocker.];W[rp];B[mc]C[H:

Good move (just 40 moves too late ;-) )];W[qf]
(;B[qh]LB[lf:A][of:C][pf:D][rj:B]C[H:

Direction of attack is wrong. Blacks big framework is about A, not B.

If White should live small at the right side, but Black gets a solid connection shielding white from the A space, Black should be very happy.

Black should play D (contact) or C (non contact).];W[rd];B[rf]
LB[pf:A]C[H:

Wrong direction again. Should be A.];W[qe];B[qd];W[re];B[rg]
;W[qc];B[rb];W[pc];B[pe];W[pg]C[H:

White is alive and freely walking into Black's framework, taking lots of points from Black.]
;B[oe];W[oc];B[nc];W[rc]
(;B[ob]LB[pf:B][ng:A][og:C]C[H:

Blocking the white group around A (or B, then C, cf. variation) is the more important part of stopping white.]
;W[pb];B[oa];W[pa];B[nb];W[ne];B[of];W[od]LB[od:B][of:A][pg:C]
C[H:

With Black's A group under attack and White invading the black framework at both, B and C, The black framework is ruined.

My review ends here as I do not consider the following moves (or mistakes) relevant in comparison to the tactical issues that have been pointed out:

1) The endgame would not have had any importance on the result if the tactical decisions had been made correctly.

2) Black can play much stronger if he improves his reading wrt. the aspects mentioned in my initial comment (cf. move #1). Improving on the end game would not result in that much strength.]
