;B[oc];W[rd]C[S16 is inviting S15 as B response,this will prevent w from connecting to right side.
after BS15 w S17 B R15...
W can then live in corner with Q18 ...];B[ck];W[ci];B[cf]C[B C14 is on wrong side. B should push C11 to ward B strong stone at D16]
;W[ei]C[w E11 good jump but gives B chance to extend toward C6]

;B[ng]C[B O13 is not aggresive enough it does not attack w, although it expands B. B gave away too much on right side too easily.
B at F9 would have kept pressue on W C11 and E11.];W[ph];B[gn]
C[this B G6 does little again B must push harder on W
F9 would be a better move];W[fl]C[W G8 is a bit risky unless a clever follow-up is there.
It seems that W has B under pressure now...];B[hl]C[B H8 is wrong side B needs  to attack C11 and E11 ,
F9 might be a good choice];W[gm];B[fm];W[hm];B[el];W[gl];B[ll]
C[B has just let w connect to the J4 grp.];W[hk]C[W H9 helps B to extend  how doe sit help W?
If W wants to attack this stone why not J8 and then F10?];B[il]
;W[hj];B[hg];W[jj];B[lj]C[M10 is OK but leaves J8 stranded, may be K8 with the connection to M8 would have forced W to strengthen at F10]
;W[jl];B[ni]C[nice play both B and W here
but B has potential for large territory in upper left];W[ok]
;B[nk]C[B O9 does connect but  E13 would have secured a big area and forced W to worry about C11]
;W[ki];B[kg];W[li]C[at this point B has still potentially a larger area in upper side than W any where else. Therefore B should concentrate on securing this area]
;B[mi];W[lg];B[lf];W[lh];B[jg];W[fc];B[gd]C[G16 is not good E17 would have secured the corner forcing W to jump out, B can then push on H17  and W would only get a snake with no territory, whereas B would be getting secure areas.]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[ed];B[de]C[nice moves by W to form the "tiger mouth", B defended well but now W can extend along upper side.]
;W[gc];B[hc];W[hb];B[ic];W[ib];B[jb];W[cb];B[db];W[eb];B[ec]
;W[fe];B[dc]C[B had the chance for a good KO fight here, with more to gain than loose W would have had a hard struggle.B at F16 would have disconnected W from the center and made it difficult for W to live on the edge.]
;W[fd];B[fb];W[gb];B[ea];W[ge];B[hd];W[fg]C[A very nice connection by W,  black should have given w the corner and surrounded it to give B outer strength, now W has gained about 10 points that were in B territory!]
;B[dj];W[di];B[ji];W[kj];B[hi];W[gi];B[gh];W[fh]C[W could have poked at J15 with possible good results. This would have taken about 5 points from B]
;B[ij]C[B at J10 is not good since the response is known and is sente for W. Don't make a move like this where the reponse will not help you. These positions are best left for a KO , there you get 2 moves in a row and the connection at J9 might have been realized.]
;W[ik];B[ii];W[ek];B[dl];W[bj];B[bk];W[ak];B[al];W[aj];B[bm]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[an];B[am];W[cm]C[W at C7  looks OK but B has too many liberties for this to be useful, it was a wasted move. Compare this move to a W jump to B13..]
;B[cl]C[B C10 a sente move then W B11 followed by D6 would have been better. Filling in your own space costs territory!]
;W[hn];B[bh];W[cg];B[bg];W[dg];B[cj];W[bi];B[ej];W[fj];B[co]
;W[bp];B[eo];W[go];B[ep];W[eq];B[ef]C[this is an overplay since W has cut at D14, but B can still connect at E15 so may be OK. :)]
;W[df];B[be]C[B15 not needed since a cut by W at C15 would not work]

C[B N18 could have been at M18];W[rn];B[sk];W[rm];B[qg];W[rf]
C[T 9 seems to be a bit of hopeful jump!];B[rg];W[re];B[qi]
;W[pi]C[W Q11 would be better used to prevent the connection of B R11 to T9 by S9 or some other move, the cut at S8 would be very big for B]
;B[qj];W[rk];B[rj];W[sl];B[sj];W[qh];B[rh];W[nl];B[ol];W[pk]
;B[qk];W[rl];B[qn];W[qo]C[not need yet, W should have attacked M10 with W N10 and then if B extends w O10 and b grp in trouble!]

C[S19 nice move by B, W must not ignore the T17 and T18 moves,
this cost W the game at the end];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[This game shows very good playing by both 18 and 19 kyu players, the overall game is well balanced; B has a better idea in the opening but doesn't take advantage, W is more daring and gets into difficulties easier.  I would have a a good game with either of them...]
