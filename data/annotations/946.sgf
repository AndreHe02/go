AB[pd][dp]C[This might be an interesting game to get commented; I don't think I've submitted a handicap game in which I played white, before.  I seem to have difficulty playing fast enough moves as white; I'm mostly a slow-and-steady player I think.  I'm open to any suggestions, but I guess I'm mostly looking to understand where I'm playing slow moves.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nq];B[jp]LB[pn:A][qn:B]C[Especially considering that this is a handicap game, a second approach move at A or B
seems nicer. The variations can get quite complex. There are also "new" opinions on
variations starting with a double approach. Look it up in Ishida's "Dictionary of basic
joseki, Volume 3", Bozulich's "Get strong at joseki 3" and Huiren/Chatterjee's
"Cosmic go".];W[no];B[pn]LB[qn:A][ql:B]C[I would have played this at A to prevent a white play at B becoming good later on.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[kr]C[Is K2 better?

-K2 would in my opinion be much much better. This move helps black.]
;B[jr];W[kq];B[jq]TR[mr][nr][ns][ms]MA[eq][fq][gq][hq][hr][gr]
[fr][er]C[Compare the value of getting small life (the triangles) to the potential black gets. It
will be very hard for white to reduce here in a positive manner, i.e. without giving
black massive thickness facing upwards.];W[kp]LB[dj:A][jo:B]
TR[dd]MA[jp][jq][jr][dp]C[Much too slow. A is the urgent point. It extends nicely from white's marked stone and prevents black
to extend from his marked stones. Black is likely to respond to this move BUT consider who is helped
by a black stone at B.];B[jo]C[Variation]
(;W[ql]LB[qr:A][rr:B]C[Positive move, although exchanging white A for black B first seems like a better idea. As
it stands now, black can go back to play at A as soon as he should need it.   -Here comes another variation which Harry 3 dan says is superior.]

(;B[qm]MA[qj][pi][pj][qi][qh][ph]C[Bad move. Black is likely to get shut in now. Running out with P7 seems to be the natural move.
This could be regarded as proper if black has a strong position in the marked area.]
;W[pl]C[Good.]
(;B[qr]C[Urgent, but now black will get shut in.];W[qh]LB[nm:A]
[qf:B][nd:C][ph:D]C[Good move, but just sealing black in with should be considered. Black doesn't have
a good followup on the right side. Harry 3 dan says this is the right move though. Possibly even
at B, white responds at C and black D.];B[qf]LB[qj:A]C[Good move. Threatens a play at A.]
;W[rg]LB[dj:A]C[How is this?  Is P12 better?  Is it better to leave this group and take a big point elsewhere?

-P12 looks a lot better. This helps black more than it helps white since it removes most of
the aji of a later invasion at R17. Playing tenuki here could perhaps be considered too.
Black could also consider tenuki to get to A first.];B[rf]LB[dj:A]
C[Very big but probably not as big as A.];W[dj]C[Finally. :-)]
;B[jd]TR[jd][id][ic][jc][kc][kd][fc]C[Natural direction. The difficult question is which of the marked points to play.]
;W[cn]C[Very good. This flattens black considerably. :-)];B[en]
LB[cp:A][cq:B]MA[jo][jp][jq][jr]C[A is probably better considering the thickness from the marked stones. White can now invade at B
and black will end up badly overconcentrated.];W[fq]LB[nc:A]
[cq:B][eq:C]MA[cn]C[Overplay?

-Looks like a bad overplay. A move at A looks good. Invading at B would be sound.
Harry says the proper reply is black B, unless one wants to be completely certain about being
able to kill, then C is the move. This has no impact on the marked stone though.]

(;B[dq];W[do];B[eo];W[ep]C[How about this?

-Messy.]
(;B[fp]TR[jo][jp][jq][jr]C[Completely wrong direction. Now would be a good time to use the marked stones. Push white towards
them, not towards the corner.];W[eq];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[dr]

[fq]MA[do][cn][bo][ao][bp][cp]C[Double ko in black's favor? Perhaps it's better to just give up on this?

-Probably w should just go on to take a large point some place...
After the triangled stones are gone, it seems like the square marked stones will come under fire.]
;W[rl]LB[fc:A][nc:B]C[Not so big, a move at A or B looks bigger. White doesn't want black to play at A.]
;B[fr];W[so]LB[or:A][cl:B]MA[cn][bo][ao][bp][cp][do][aq]C[Ok, I guess this doesn't really threaten the L&D of black's corner.  Is it a bad move?  Worth playing?  It seems to be sente, but it doesn't kill, I think.

-It's not urgent. Unless you are sure that this move kills (it doesn't since black at A gives an eye)
it should not be played now. It may be some endgame points in sente but it could also be used as
ko threats later on since there's no way black can be killed here *if* he responds.

the marked stone. By playing B, black has forced white to eliminate his bad potential.]

Black is indeed getting a lot more out of this than white is.
