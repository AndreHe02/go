C[In this game, white makes a relatively large territory at the bottom that I, playing black, failed to reduce or invade.   I managed to stay connected and win, but against a stronger opponent I would have been toast quite early on.  (Of course, that's alway true. :-)

I would like to understand what I should have done about white's framework at the bottom, when, and how.   I think there are several points in the game when I could have done something, but I couldn't figure out how to succeed.

Thanks in advance for your time reviewing this game.

----

Hi, I am Jan-Willem Swane. I prefix my remarks with 'tsjanl'.

I am so free to change your question a bit: should you do something about white's framework? 

Your question shows that you make a mistake that is common with beginning players: you focus too much on the gains of your opponent, forgetting about your own strengths and weaknesses. Go is a game of give and take. The secret is getting a little bit more with every stone than you are giving.

In this review, I'll try to show how you could have developed the game better regarding the strengths of your own position.

But remember: I only play go for 14 months and am around 12k, so I can't tell you the truth.

Enjoy...];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp]C[tsjanl:

This sequence is often played by people that play a lot of handicap games, because they know the 4-4 joseki best.

There is nothing wrong with it, but know that with two 4-4's, you play for influence, not territory.]
;B[qn];W[nq];B[cn]LB[qn:A][nq:B]C[tsjanl: I find leaving A a bit dubious. You give white an object of attack, especially because his position is quite save because of B. (see variation on next move).]

(;W[dl]LB[qk:A];B[en];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[cp]LB[bl:A]C[I guess 'a' would have been the joseki here rather than c4.   Later on, black has to make some effort to invade the left side.

tsjanl:

I do agree that A appears to be better. It serves a double purpose: giving black a base and puting pressure on the white stone.

Playing double purpose moves is one of the secrets of getting stronger.]
;W[dq];B[do];W[ip];B[qk]LB[lq:A]SQ[ip]C[I thought briefly about playing at 'a' here instead, but it seemed kind of risky because of the marked stone.  White later makes a lot of territory on teh lower side, which was worth more than I got on the right side with the the two-point extension at R9.

tsjanl: Invading at A would be bad, because R6 is weak. White could gain strenght by putting pressure on on A. If he could force black to live in gote (that means: black has to play a move that white doesn't have to answer), he has time to play around R9. Surely, he would lose some points at the bottom, but that would be greatly compensated in influence.

When you look at the situation before you play R9, you see that you have two groups that haven't been settled. That's bad, because it gives your opponent the possibility to gain by attacking.

In general, try to have no more than one weak group. By playing at A, you would create a third weak group.

R9 is a very good move (like B8 would be). When deciding which move to play, you could follow this checklist:

- Do I have a weak group: strengthen it.
- Does my opponent have a weak group: pressure it.
- Otherwise play a big move.

This is what is meant by "Play urgent moves before big moves."]

(;B[gc]LB[jc:A][dl:B][go:C]C[tsjanl: As logical as this moves seems, I don't think it is best. A doesn't threaten your stones, so an answer isn't directly needed. White B is very weak, and you could gain by harassing it after you have build some strength with C (See variation).]
;W[cf]LB[dl:A];B[cd]LB[cc:B][gc:D][bd:A][dd:C]C[I thought about playing at 'A' instead (which is joseki).  This still looks okay to me, but it might be a bit overconcentrated and white playing at 'A' could be bad for black.

tsjanl:

When you play at A, White can play later at B, which gives possibilities because of the great gap between C and D. So I think your move is ok.]
;W[dh]
(;B[me]LB[ob:B][lc:A][pc:C][oo:D]SQ[ip][nq]C[Splitting white with 'A' might have worked, maybe?  Also, now that I look at the whole board, it seems that white's weakest connection is the marked stones (though he seems okay on both sides, so maybe messing with it would just be separating two strong groups.)

What would be a better move here than N15?  Maybe a playing the corner near 'B'?

tsjanl:

One possiblitiy would to play at C. This makes a possible move at A more severe. I wouldn't like B, because it will strengthen white (see variation).

I don't think your move is too bad. It is sente because it threathens A. After white's answer you could play around D.]
;W[ld];B[md];W[mc];B[le];W[kd];B[ke];W[je]
(;B[id]LB[lo:A]SQ[je]C[This move is sente, but it's really just annoying white, who can live now.   White can later escape out into the center because of the marked stone, so this doesn't contain him.

tsjanl: This is a really bad move. It  just helps white. Now that you have build a wall, it is time to use it by playing on the bottom. (see variation)]
;W[jd];B[ic];W[pc]C[This could have been prevented if I'd made a play in the corner earlier, I think.

tsjanl: Yes, but then you wouldn't have the wall. Go is about making choices.]

;W[qd];B[pe]LB[qe:A]C[I don't like this empty triangle much.  What's a better move here?

tsjanl: Creating a ko with A is an alternative, but I think white has more chances.]

(;W[qb]LB[rc:A]C[tsjanl: You are lucky that white chooses the wrong side (see variation).]

;B[rd];W[qe];B[rf];W[pb]
(;B[qq]LB[lo:B][lq:A]C[I'm not certain invading at the 3-3 here makes more sense than at 'a'.  I'm trying to understand where I went wrong that allowed white to gain so much at the bottom later on.  Maybe this was it?

tsjanl:

With the wall on top, invading at 3-3 or A are both a poor choices, because they force white into the centre, destroying your potential moyo.

I still like B (see variation).];W[pq];B[qp];W[po]C[tsjanl: White is making you flat on the side. Your wall is getting useless quickly.]

(;B[on]LB[nm:A]C[This cut fails.  I later lose two stones in it, but it doesn't do much to hurt white.  What should have been done here?

tsjanl:

Losing two stones is no problem, but there is a better cut at A (see variation).]
;W[nm];B[nn]LB[ok:A]C[tsjanl: Better at A.];W[pl];B[qm]
(;W[mn]LB[ok:A]C[tsjanl: You are very lucky (see variation).]

(;B[gn]LB[bl:B][gp:A]C[This is intended to run out black's weak group on the left and keep white's group on the right from connecting to the bottom.  I was aiming at 'a' later.   Actually, the earlier omitted slide at 'b' looks still possible to me, and might have been a better move.

tsjanl: Your move is an important one. If White would have played there, he would get a big moyo at the bottom, because of the wall he has built on the right. (See variation).]
;W[ko]LB[kq:A]C[tsjanl: This ends the reasonable possibiltiies of invading around A.]

(;B[gp]LB[dj:A]C[tsjanl: This just wins a few points. What about a splitting attack with A on the right now that you have enforced your group? (see variation).]
;W[gq];B[fo];W[hp]
(;B[go]LB[dj:A][nj:B]C[tsjanl: Small because g4 is not essential for the safety of tyour group. A is still possible. B is also big. (See variation).]
;W[ep];B[in]LB[dj:B][nj:A]C[tsjanl: Slow. A and B are a lot bigger.]
;W[kk]C[When I saw this move, I thought to myself, "Ah-ah!  White is trying to use his thickness to build territory, which I've been told is wrong.  In this case, it worked for white, probably because I didn't respond correctly.  I ignored this move for the time being.]
;B[cj]C[tsjanl: Good, because will not gain a lot by the wall it will build in exchange. Potential territory in the centre is open at too many sides.

Furthermore, you end in sente (white plays the last move locally), which is very important.]
;W[dj];B[cl]C[I think here I stopped trying to cut white and started thinking about connecting to the group in the lower left.  I don't know if it was just that I got scared or didn't have a good plan to split white.  I would appreciate any comments on alternatives to this move.

tsjanl: It's white who decides in this case. When he plays D10, going for territory is very good. Don't underestimate the amount of points you win (and white loses) here.

A very good thing about your invasion is that you end in sente (white plays the last move locally).]

;W[el]
(;B[ef]LB[df:A]C[Looking back at the game, I left this knight's move open for a long time.  Later on, white messes with it.  Would a contact move at 'a' have been better?

tsjanl: First: your timing is good. Now that white has strengthened his group at one side, he is threathening to expand on the other side.

I think your move is better than A. Touching strengthens white, and gives your stone a liberty less. (See variation).]
;W[df]LB[mi:A]C[tsjanl: Small. A move around A would be very big.]

(;B[eg]LB[nj:A]TR[je]C[tsjanl: You cannot win a lot here, because White has the marked stone. You can more on the right (see variantion).]
;W[ei];B[hf]C[I'm not sure about move.  It aimed to lightly contain white's group while extending more into the center, but it failed at the former.  I don't like it much looking at it now.  Suggestions?

tsjanl: First, you could play here because white answered your last move.

I still think playing on the right is bigger.];W[if];B[ie];W[jf]
;B[li]TR[nk]C[tsjanl: Finally a move around here, although I think it's a bit too loose, because white can still slip in with the marked stone.]
;W[kg];B[mg]LB[lg:A]C[tsjanl: A is better.];W[lh];B[mh];W[mj]
LB[ni:A]C[tsjanl: A is better, because it threathenes to cut and to walk into your area.]
;B[nj]LB[ni:A]C[I was unsure about this move.   I was just trying to stay connected.

tsjanl: A is better, because it has more liberties.];W[ni];B[oj]

(;W[lk];B[lg];W[kh];B[oh]LB[mi:A]C[tsjanl: Cutting at A seems to be enough.]
;W[mi];B[hh];W[ih];B[ii];W[ji];B[ij];W[be]LB[bd:A]C[White starts a sort of endgame sequence here.   Since this is the corner, I felt I had to respond.   We now see one reason why the joseki at 'a' (instead of C16) I missed in opening would have been valuable.

[kq:A]TR[nd][ig][jj][jo][bq]C[This is a strange move.  Part of it was trying to stay connected, and part of it was to try to put some pressure on whites group on the left.  Of course, white is definitely alive on the left, so that doesn't make a lot of sense.

In this part of the game, I was musing greedily about playing around 'a' to see if I could try to live inside white's territory and therefore reduce it.  Is that an insane thought?

tsjanl: Invading at a would be senseless. There is not room enough to live and you can't run out because of B.

In this part of the game it is important to find moves which are sente (in other words: that white has to answer). I have marked a few with triangles.]
