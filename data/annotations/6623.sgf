C[LetMeLearn [8k\]: hi
LetMeLearn [8k\]: have a good and fun game ^^
NickHopper [7k\]: hello];B[pd]C[Hi, I am Shu, I will be reviewing your game. I play on KGS under the ign Shuchan.

Your game is interesting, it seems to me that you have a good whole board sense but lacks fighting skills and life and death. I recommend you to study more life and death to hone your sense of critical points. 

NickHopper [7k\]: good game];W[qq];B[dd];W[cq]C[This might be the first time I saw a double san-san.]
;B[jd]C[Shu: Good point. Black has 3 4th line stones with strong influence vs white's 2 low stones.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[Shu: Good. Blocking the other way (R16) is the wrong direction. See var.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[og];W[cf]
(;B[ef]C[Shu: ok, Pincering at c12 is also an option. See var.]
;W[cd]
(;B[cc]C[Shu: This move contridicts your E14 move, as E14 wants to build a wall, and C17 wants to keep the corner. See Var.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[dc];B[ed];W[cb];B[bc]TR[ec]C[Maybe I should've went to E17 without fighting at all, making good thickness on both sides?]

;B[cj]C[This felt bad, I beginned a fight in the pregame, had a heavy group to begin with.]

;B[ea];W[da];B[ba];W[ec];B[fd];W[hd];B[ic];W[id];B[ia]C[As you can see, I didn't know how to deal with G18 and it became a catastrophy. E17 would surely look better now as it might've killed the corner in this position.]
;W[ea]
(;B[he]C[This is where the "game" begun, we both made 16 ladderbreakers - instead of "fundamentals of go" and eating the ladder right away (I wanted to keep sente) I went to fight foolishly]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[oj];B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[mk]C[LetMeLearn [8k\]: huh this is nice reading practice : )

Shu: I recommend you attack the white group on the right now. Now, there is D11 white group and P10 white group that are weak, so you should chase them towards each other than do a splitting attack. Even if you dont do a splitting attack, you still get a nice profit. I have put some variations.]

(;B[ql]C[NickHopper [7k\]: yea
NickHopper [7k\]: i thought it was breaker...
NickHopper [7k\]: but seems made a mistake];W[pi]C[LetMeLearn [8k\]: I know, hence tenuki
LetMeLearn [8k\]: Q11 is nice move though
NickHopper [7k\]: maybe... lets see )];B[oi];W[nh];B[mh];W[lh]
;B[lg];W[kg];B[kh];W[jh]C[NickHopper [7k\]: too hard to read this for me... especially what to do later )))
LetMeLearn [8k\]: haha
LetMeLearn [8k\]: don't worry, mee too
LetMeLearn [8k\]: I'm just too thickheaded to stop now :DDD
NickHopper [7k\]: shure it is really unbeliviable how far and precise profi can read. I cant read this not very compicated position ((

Shu: I would just take at M11.]
(;B[jf];W[ki]C[this whole position looks absurd for black];B[ni]
;W[mg];B[lf];W[mi];B[nk];W[qj];B[pl];W[qi]C[I noticed I can't keep white separated if I try to save R12, so I had to sacrifice it.]
;B[oh];W[ph]
(;B[pp]C[I wanted to play some big points, as I was behind.

Shu: this doesnt really attack white or give black any territory. P3 might be a better point. See Var.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[or];B[qo];W[cl];B[dk];W[em];B[hh]C[I tried to separate the left group, and kill it. Was there a better way?]
;W[fj];B[hj]C[NickHopper [7k\]: wumps is your teacher?
LetMeLearn [8k\]: well, yes, you could say that heh];W[gl]C[NickHopper [7k\]: lucky ))

Shu: Death is very close for Black, Black must defend. See var.]

(;B[ml];W[mj]C[wumps [3k\]: lol];B[pq];W[pr];B[nq];W[nj]C[I thought it would've been a 4 point gote if I saved those stones, I was wondering if P14 was a threat or not.]
;B[nr];W[rr];B[jq];W[of]C[...it seems it was. Now white's all connected.]

;W[cn]C[I thought this might build nice profit in the bottom

Shu: White is strong in the center, without another stone, Black cant keep the bottom.]
;B[ai];W[hg]C[LetMeLearn [8k\]: thanks mate

Connecting here must've been really big for me, white just got huge profit.]

(;B[cr];W[ca]C[This looks like a weird gote to me, white was unconditionally alive. Maybe he's aiming for a ko somewhere and reducing threats?

(or playing super-safe because he's so much ahead already?)

Shu: maybe a misread ;)];B[bq];W[bp];B[br];W[pb]C[Shu: Big.]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[nc];W[nl];B[nm];W[ll];B[mm];W[jo]C[at this point I had no idea of how to answer. Trying to build territory with walls is wrong, I just didn't know what to do.
