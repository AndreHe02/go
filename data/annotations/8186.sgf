Hi, I'm andycs1, and was playing black in this game. I lost by 6.5 points, but couldn't really see where I went wrong. There seemed to be plenty of places where I had sente, but didn't really know what to do with it.

I've made a few comments through the game, to show my thought process.

I'd really appreciate any guidance with where I could have done better, especially in the first 100 moves or so.

Thanks in advance for the review, Andy

Hi Andy, 

my reviews are marked with "r:" i'll not comment every move; but don't hesitate to contact me if something is still unclear. Also sorry for my strange english .. :)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[np]C[andycs1: This seemed like a good opportunity for black to grab the top L corner. I thought R4 might get walled in but would likely be able to make life in the corner, and I'd get a good gain by having the extra corner.

r: o.k.];B[dd];W[nc];B[oc]LB[nc:C][qf:B][pj:A][qp:D]C[r: although this is joseki, i would use it only in handycap games. It works good if there is already some stone at arround A. I personally would play arround B in this area. -> might give C a smal base but give you the opportunity to connect to D to have the whole right side.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jd];B[oq]LB[dp:B][np:A]C[andycs1: I thought this a good opportunity to make the usual opening shimari in the bottom L. I expected a splitting play around R9, but thought this would still be ok.  I also considered G17 to pressure white's top group and start to solidy the top L corner.

r: i would connect with your suggested R9. You move forces a white wall at A which might work very well with B giving white huge influence at the bottom]
;W[nq];B[pm]C[r: ok. .. but too close to the bottom as the black stones at the bottom right are strong]
;W[op];B[pp]LB[dn:A][fp:B][oq:C]C[andycs1: As soon as I played this I kicked myself for not playing Q3 instead. I was surprised white never killed P3 as in the variation.

r: Q3 would have been better.

but also a stone arrond A or B are interesting as your stones at the lower right are alive even if C gets captured]
(;W[fc];B[fd]C[andycs1: My thinking here was that I shouldn't let W get away with making a 3 point extension from the single stone at K16. It seemed to me that if W played F16 then he would have very good and efficient shape, with both sides of his moyo being three point extensions from two stone walls - so I played where I thought he should play.]
;W[gd];B[fe];W[ec];B[dc]C[andycs1: I wanted to avoid making an empty triangle by playing at E16; this was the best alternative I could think of. I was a little worried about being cut, but thought the aji at G17 would allow me to make life in the corner with the D17 group.

r: all ok till now];W[cf];B[ce]C[andycs1:  I wanted to keep white out of the corner, and thought this would also help protect me from being easily cut.

r: o.k.];W[be]
(;B[bd]LB[df:A]C[r: you move tries to keep the corner; thats worth little points at this stage. i would prefer playing at A; yes white might get live in the corner; but it can be sealed of.]
;W[de];B[cd]C[andycs1: I was definitely worried about being cut, but thought I would live ok in the corner with white having so many cutting points (e.g. see variation for what I imagined could happen)]
;W[ee];B[ed]C[Seemed best to connect solidly and keep white apart]
;W[eg]
(;B[bf];W[bg]LB[cg:A]C[r:mistake by white ... A would make good shape]
;B[df];W[ef];B[cg];W[dg]
(;B[bh]C[andycs1: Perhaps C12 better here?];W[cf];B[ag];W[cj]
;B[cn]LB[ef:E][ch:D][dh:C][cj:F][ip:A][fq:B]C[andycs1: Perhaps black playing C6 was an overplay? I was trying to use the strength of my upper group

R: the upper white group has access to the center; the lower white stone has no trouble to make live as all is open. so white can attack your black stone easy -> which has no support anywhere -> make white stronger


I would played somewhere arround A or B trying to break the mojo

local i like C -> protects D, and seperates E and F, which hardly can be defended at the same time]
;W[gq];B[bp];W[cq]
(;B[cp]LB[bq:A]C[andycs1: This looks kinda dumb in hindsight. Not sure what would have been better, maybe D12 to put white's single stone under attack, or even C9? I began to feel that C6 had been a bad idea at this point - as white's starting to look strong on the bottom and I'm getting nothing but a weak group on the L.


R: that stone belongs to A!];W[bq];B[bk];W[bj]
(;B[ck]LB[dh:A]C[r: A! seperate the groups!];W[ch];B[df];W[qh]
(;B[qg]LB[qj:A]C[r: i suggest A; as the black stones at the upper right are too strong to slip under]
;W[ph];B[dh]LB[qj:A]C[r: how about A? -> now the 2 stones have to run.]
;W[ci];B[ei]C[andycs1: Felt this splitting of white was worthwhile even though R10 was very tempting.

r: easy attack for white ... even if white does not manage to catch ... he will gain profit]
;W[cf];B[bg];W[eh];B[di];W[dj];B[ej]LB[ef:B][fi:A][ck:C]C[r: no! at A -> gives more liberties to your black stones; attacks the group at B and leaves the weak C untouched for now.]
;W[dk];B[dl]
(;W[ek];B[fi]LB[gi:A][gj:B]C[r: very  VERY bad shape!!

A and B work both ..];W[gk];B[fh];W[gg];B[fg];W[ql];B[qm]C[andycs1: This felt too heavy, though with P3 so obviously dead I was worried about the life of my BL group.

r nothing to worry right now. there is plenty of room even if p3 dies]
;W[pl];B[nm]LB[ol:A]C[andycs1: Tried to make some inroads into white's vast central moyo.

r: maybe A, attacking the white group AND slip into the center?]
;W[on];B[om];W[mn];B[mk]LB[ml:D][cm:C][hn:B][hq:E][jq:A]C[R: you gain a problem at A ... you should invade asap ... a stone at B may work and connect to group C or D


also a fight at E might be worth a try ...];W[mh];B[ge];W[hd]
(;B[el]C[andycs1:This was to try and strengthen my lower left group in sente by threatening white's D9 group.

r: right spirit ... but to slow ...];W[fk];B[hi]LB[gk:C][hn:A]
[jq:B]C[r: i would suggest the other side -> at arround A -> kill white teritory; threatening B and killing C]
;W[fn];B[en]LB[fk:B][fm:A][cn:C]C[r: no at A -> otherwise B gets connected and C gets sealed]
;W[eo];B[do];W[ep];B[fm];W[gn];B[rh]LB[gk:B][gm:A]C[andycs1: a wasted move and loss of sente perhaps? Probably anything in the centre would have been better, and I could have kept up the pressure on white's D9 group.

r: far to early; B still might be killed. so A(?)];W[ri];B[rg]
;W[ih];B[qi]C[andycs1: Madness, I misread the ladder. But felt that white had a weakness here to be exploited, somehow ...]
;W[pi];B[qj];W[rj];B[pj];W[oj];B[ok];W[pk];B[nj];W[oi]
(;B[ml]C[r: i don't understand that move.];W[ni];B[or]LB[gk:A]
C[andycs1:Finally realised that saving P3 was a good idea

r: might be ... but still you need to kill A to win this game]
;W[nr];B[jn];W[ip];B[gm];W[in];B[im];W[io];B[km];W[ik];B[ki]
LB[ii:A][gk:B]C[r: no at A ... B can't run to the lower group ... but still to the upper.]
;W[kh];B[ji]C[andycs1: Playing this at J11 would have been better perhaps. After this my threat on the E9 group evaporated.

r: yes J11];W[ii]

;B[ie]LB[kq:A]C[andycs1: Was trying to get something out of the cutting point at G17


r: I don't see any ...

anyway you need something big to win this game from now ... all i see here is a try to seperate the white groups below at A]
