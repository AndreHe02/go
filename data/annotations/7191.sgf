C[Hello !

I have some questions about the beginning of this game. I finally won because my opponent made a mistake at the very end of the game (the game was very close without this mistake) but I think I had a very bad position at the beginning of the middle game. So I have some questions about the 40 first moves.

I play Black in this game.

Thank you for your commentaries !!];B[pd];W[dp];B[qq];W[dd]

(;W[pp]LB[np:A]C[Here I think O4 would have been better for White (because of the D4 stone).

[Nexik\] You can't said which move is better in this stage, both are ok]
;B[pq];W[op];B[ro];W[oq]
(;B[jq]LB[iq:A]C[Maybe this is too close of the White P3 group. Maybe J3 would have been better ?

[Nexik\] You should play at Q6 (variation 1)];W[gq];B[mq]C[[Nexik\] Black is in trouble, fortunately he miss his change (Variation 2)]

(;W[mo]LB[no:A]C[[Nexik\] Very risky plan (weakness at A)];B[jo]
;W[or]
(;B[ck]LB[qf:A][qj:B][pn:C]C[Here I thought that I have no time to add a stone to the Q3 group, but this will create a second weak group for Black. During the whole game White attacked these two groups.

Here I thought it was important to go after the left side. But maybe it is better to construct around the top and the right side. But since the S5 stone is very low, I thought that the right side was less interesting than the left side. But maybe something like A, B or C would have been a better move.

[Nexik\] Black C is the most active plan (Variation 3)];W[ci]

(;B[cn]C[[Nexik\] Instead of this Black should play tsuke (Variation 4)]
;W[bp]C[Now I have two weak groups];B[en];W[go];B[gm];W[hn]

(;B[hm]C[[Nexik\] Pushing from behind is bad];W[in];B[jn]LB[lo:A]
C[[Nexik\] Risky, better to make sabaki at A];W[im];B[lm];W[mm]
;B[ll];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[rm];W[hk]LB[ql:A]C[After this I had a hard time defending my two groups. The fight continued through the whole board.

I don't understand how the situation became this bad for Black in the 40 first moves. Can you please show me which moves were really bad for Black ?

Thank you

[Nexik\] Your biggest problem is that you replay all opponent moves try play your own go. For exmaple now A is very interesting move.
