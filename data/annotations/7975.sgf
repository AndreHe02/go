C[Im ShiHouto, I was playing Black and lost by resignation

Y: Hi ShiHouto, I'm Yaoundee on KGS. I'll begin all my comments with a Y. The graphical interface I'm using for this review is Multigo. If you have any questions contact me by e-mail or on KGS.]
;B[pd]C[ShiHouto [16k\]: hi hf

LB[jd:A][cn:B][qn:C]C[I wasn't sure wheth=
er to go for a side enclosure on the top of try to invade my opponents corn=
er

Y: Basically imho it is up to your liking if you build up the upper side or confront the opponent already.
'A' is a big move, since it is an extension from your shimari (corner enclosure) on the left, backed up by the 4-4 stone on the right. 
However the approach to white's left down corner (the move you played) seems to be even bigger, since it prevents white from making a shimari on its own. This shimari-preventing move is called kakari. Both shimaris and kakaris are regarded as very valuable. (Instead of 7) you could also play the kakari on the circled point..
Still I wouldn't deny 'A', 'cause after black 'A' and white 'B' black can play first on the (yet empty) right side - 'C' for example.]
;W[dm];B[ep]TR[jp]LB[eo:A][fp:B][cq:C]C[I tried enclosing the corner, but i feel this was a real fal=
lacy on my part

Y: Enclosing white in the corner is out of question unless whites plays tenuki here (elsewhere)
Your move seperates the white stones. But black can be cut too. (Like it happened in the game). Therefor the usual (joseki-) move would be the one-point-jump on 'A'. Then white would play on 'B' to not be enclosed.
Another idea for black would be to go in the corner with 'C'. 
The fact that the move you played is so loose has the consequence that you must fight now where the opponent is stronger (he has the marked stone in addition). You should avoid to start big fights where your opponent is stronger.]
;W[dp];B[do];W[eo];B[fp];W[en]TR[jp]LB[fo:A]C[Y: Your knight move (move 9) has provoked a cross-cut and a really complicated situation.  
And black is in disadvantage. It looks like he would loose one of his groups. 

Instead of A 

All I know is that this is a severe fight.
And I can say that the marked stone helps white now.
As black I would try to catch the two corner stones in the corner now. If white can live there it would be tough for black and he may loose one of his groups.
(See variation)]
(;B[cm]C[Y: Not a bad move either];W[cl];B[dl]C[Y: This crosscut is too aggressiv. 
Playing it means to give up the two black stones on line 5 an sphere of influence on the upper left instead (see variation)]
;W[cn];B[bm]
(;W[bn]C[Y: This is a blunder of white. You should now give the atari (see variation)]
(;B[bl];W[el];B[ck];W[dk]C[Y: white seems to be a very aggressiv player.
You still could play the cut/atari on D6];B[cj];W[cl];B[dj]
TR[cj][ck][bl][bm][cm]LB[qn:A][qj:B][jd:C]C[Y: This is a solid and maybe even big move.

However you should be aware that the fight is over. You can afford to play somewhere else too. Like A,B or C. The marked stones are not in danger. But I don't know what is the best. 

Then there's the ko. You should understand it. When white wins it - no problem. You'll have a big move for free (again A,B or C) if white closes it now. For you beating the ko produces two threats at the moment: E9 and D6. We see later what happens...

Your stones on the 4. line can help you later when you invade on the down side or when you build something in the center.]
;W[am];B[dl];W[ek];B[cl]C[Y: Here comes the proof that you didn't understood the ko properly. After white has covered one of the (former mentioned) threats you should play D6! (see variation) 
Winning the ko serves you for nothing. 
It is also possible to play elsewhere. After white A8 you still can play B9 to save your stones.]
;W[fi];B[dn]C[Y: aah - finally!

This moves also prrofs white A7 as an useless move.];W[em];B[bo]
;W[go];B[er];W[eq];B[fq];W[bp];B[cp];W[cq];B[an];W[aq];B[br]
;W[dr];B[fr];W[es];B[fs];W[gq];B[bq];W[gp]C[Y: Wow!
You have achieved to survive with both of your groups and to kill whites corner.

Now you should take the initiative (sente) by making a big move (I would recommend the right side). Instead of creeping along the 2. line.]
;B[gr];W[hr];B[hq];W[iq];B[hs];W[hp];B[ir];W[hq];B[jr];W[fo]
;B[ds];W[kr];B[ks];W[lr];B[ls]C[Y: These moves look like you wanted to reduce whites territory. But white has no territory there. It's all still open! You should play on the other side (on the right side, in the center or in the down right corner).
You should save these moves for the endgame.];W[ms];B[js];W[jq]
C[Greed at its worst];B[gs];W[is];B[cr];W[dh]C[Y: An odd move of white, that should be ignored. Its reducing blacks potential territory for some points but thats all.]
;B[ch]TR[pd]C[Y: Too small.
Have a look at your corner stone. It stands all alone as the only stone played in the entire upper right quarter of the board. Shouldn't both players be eager to play there first?]
;W[di];B[pn]LB[qn:A]C[Y: Good.
I can't say which is the right strategy here. 
Hm, I like this move. Normally it indicates that you don't want to invade the corner but build up the right side. But here its also a post that looks towards the center where lays whites potential moyo. 
My first reflex was to play the conventional low approach 'A'. But then white could play on 77 (where black stands now) and consolidate his moyo. And -if black sticks to the right side- the corner too.]
;W[on];B[om];W[pm]C[Close range fighting is what Im worst at (unless =
I feel I have good influence in that area)

Y: You feel a good influence? But I don't see any. You have only two stones there, that now are seperated.
If you don't want to fight you should play a tight connetion - on 80 (Q7) f.e. (instead of 79 which invites the crosscut).
But you have to learn close range fighting anyway. Isn't it a main thing of go?
But whats your plan? 
My plan would be like this: use q6 first to consolidate a group on the side or in the corner. When this works black can run with P7 into the center and thereby destroying whites moyo.]
;B[oo]C[Y: Usually after a cross cut you extend on one your stones. The atari strengthen white.]
;W[nn];B[pl]C[Y: Again atari?];W[po];B[qm];W[qn]C[Y: I think you should end the ko (as in the variation). The ponnuki is quite valluable. Unfortunately white has already many points on the bottom. But black is not in disadvatage imho.]
(;B[rn];W[pm];B[qo];W[pn];B[rl]SQ[pl][qm][rn]MA[ol][ro]C[Y: You are strewed around a strong white cross. You could connect 4 stones to a strong forms, but there are 2 cuts, too. I think white has profitted from the sequence.]
;W[ol];B[qp];W[qq];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[rs];B[ok]C[Y: Sente - YAY]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[om];B[pk];W[nk];B[nj];W[ml];B[mk]LB[lk:A]C[Y: white better plays at 'A'. The one point alone is not worth it.]
;W[nl];B[mj];W[oj]LB[oi:A]C[This is where I think I lost my edge in the game, i had a nice portion of=
 territory in the making in the upper right

Y: Where you could just catch the cutting stone in a ladder with 'A']
;B[pj];W[oi];B[pi]TR[nj][mj][mk]C[Y: The three marked stones are important. If white can catch them the moyo becomes too big. So you better play from them.]
;W[oh];B[pg];W[ph]LB[og:A][qg:B]C[Y: Where white goes is nothing to get for him. Better answer with a solid move like A or B.]
;B[qh];W[qg];B[qi]LB[pf:A]C[im not sure if this=
 move was needed or not

Y: You should rather play 'A'];W[pf];B[og];W[ng]
(;B[pq]LB[nd:A][ej:B]C[Y: You could play a ladder breaker on 'A'. That forces white to catch so you get a compensation.]

C[This was an invasion in vain, I was hoping to either make life, or captur=
e the group above these stones

Y: You come from the wrong side. above is all open. The moyo is still open and the upper side too. You should use the marked stones. They are the real intruders.
White would do better to enclose your "invasion" in a large scale and play 'A' or 'B']

;W[mn]C[ShiHouto [16k\]: t=
hank you for the game
Here is where i resigned
Zexler [15k\]: thank you to)

Y: You resigend premature. If you managed to escape with your big group (N13) there would be still a chance to win the game. Though white is definetly ahead now. 

You had a difficult start in the left bottom corner. But managed to get a good result out of it. You had secure territory on the left a kakari and a hoshi (4-4-point) on the upper side, white only had this half circle of influence and the bottom right hoshi. From there on you made two wrong decision. First you creeped along the 2. line and had your stones caught. Later you invaded into the moyo and tried to survive there by all means. Such invaions should be 'plan b'. Don't be envious. Build up your own sphere of influence first. 
Especially when you don't want to fight, you have to look for the big, strategic moves and play solid. 

I hope I could help you to improve :)])
