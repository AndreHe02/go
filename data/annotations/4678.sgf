C[This is the first game i played on tygem, the korean site. i set myself as 18k against another 18k. but he just seems to adopt the korean fighting style of play. i lost in midgame. please give me some ideas of attack directions and planning. thanks a lot.

pto:
Hello, I am pto. Fierce middle game fighter and intuition player. I think I can easily see the deciding factor in this game, and it was in middle game as you said.

But it is not the direction of play. This game felt like a race between a rabbit and tortoise, and we all know who won that one.

One warning: I won't show variations. I just give ideas on what went wrong. You need to find better variations on your own if you wish.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[cp];W[dd];B[cf];W[fc];B[di];W[ep];B[eo];W[dp]
;B[do];W[cq]C[maybe i should extend?

pto: I think this is ok but you could refer to your favourite joseki book. If white allows black to play C3 white loses all his eyes and ends up with a weak heavy group.]
;B[fp];W[co];B[bp];W[fq];B[cn]C[pto:
Here black shows first time what is about to come. Solid low risk variations are his forte.]
;W[bq];B[bo]C[lost a stone already.

pto:
Don't cry for the stone. But look at the shapes, black is clearly better of because this wall works perfectly with his stones at upper corner.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[jq]C[bad move i guess? left a weak opening.

pto:
White is in hurry to go forward and leaves a bit weak shape behind. Black punishes immediatelly. White has three cutting points in his group and he really should fix one. H3  or G3 perhaps.]
;B[gq];W[fr];B[gr];W[dr];B[hp]C[pto:
Now white K3, which was extension, is a heavy group that white cant afford to lose. White has to settle it fast because black strength on the left side makes running a losing strategy.

This is interesting because the ladder does not work. Black would propably force white to extend all the way to G7 before connecting. This would leave white with two weak heavy groups.]
;W[nq]C[pto:
Again, too fast, too thin. Rabbit jumps and triples on the tortoise. N3 is safe.]
;B[lq];W[pq];B[qq];W[op];B[po];W[pr];B[qr];W[lp];B[kp];W[kq]

C[Click B to continue]
(;B[ro]LB[rn:B][ro:A];W[om];B[jp]C[i don't know if this exchange was beneficial, because i lost a lot of stones in the process.

pto:
White needs to take S7 to get something from this exchange. Without it white has received nothing from the exchange.]
;W[mn];B[ln];W[lm];B[ko];W[mm];B[rm]C[pto:
Now the exchange: black gets one corner and one side. White gets central influence. Black S7 takes off most value from white influence though.]
;W[ql];B[rl];W[qi]C[maybe one less space farther would be better against black's counter attack.

pto:
Too fast, too far. Play hane and force black to make a weak group if he wants to fight here. Or play R9 to force black to crawl on the side while building huge central influence.]
;B[qk];W[pk];B[pl];W[pm];B[pj];W[ok];B[qj]C[pto:
Black has just penetrated the white influence.];W[qf];B[oj]
;W[nk];B[ri];W[jc];B[ob];W[pb];B[pc];W[qc];B[oc];W[qb];B[lc]
C[pto:
Again black plays sure and solid stones. He is strong and has taken away white framework. Game is almost over now.

Look at the situation: white has two corners and black one. Upper left corner is still open with but under white influence.

Black has one side and one strong framework. He has the advantage.]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[kc];B[mb];W[jb];B[la]C[i guess it's a bad exchange, losing one stone right there i might have already lost.

pto:
This exchange didn't have much effect. Black became a little stronger and white upper side is a bit stronger too.]
;W[ph];B[rh];W[rg];B[pg];W[qg];B[qh];W[oh];B[pi];W[of];B[bd]
C[pto:
Black thinks the game is over and is starting end game already.]
;W[cc];B[ef]C[pto:
Junction point that decides which framework grows and which crawls. Now black has clear advantage.]
;W[hj]C[i had to attack the middle then, i if i lost that, i have no more hopes of winning. but still, could i have attacked more fiercely?

pto:
Center is open from all sides. There is no way white can make territory there.]
;B[ek]C[pto:
Black plays solid. Tortoise keeps on going.];W[fi];B[gi];W[fk]
;B[gj];W[ej];B[fj]C[pto:
White left unnecessary cut and black took it immediatelly.]
;W[dj];B[ei]C[pto:
White left unnecessary cut and black took it immediatelly.]
;W[gn];B[go];W[el];B[dk];W[im]C[wow, losing so much stones for nothing.

pto:
Always have a plan, don't just throw stones here and there and hope for best. You might want so use D10 group as sacrifice while you penetrate black territory, or you might want to give presure to the black G10 group to make some central territory.

Perhaps extending to F12 and then going to D12 would give something. Be cunning and arrogant, but whatever you do, try to have a plan.]
;B[cj]C[pto:
Solid and slow and bullet proof.];W[gk];B[bc];W[hi];B[fh];W[ig]
;B[nh];W[og];B[nj]C[pto:
Black removes the central territory for good.];W[mj];B[mi];W[li]

;B[jm];W[jl];B[gm];W[il];B[fm];W[em];B[fn];W[ik];B[bb];W[cb]
;B[dl];W[hk]C[lucky the opponent let me connect. but he still have the advantage.

pto:
Propably courtecy from black. Based on the earlier stones I don't think he would miss this kid of opportunity.]
;B[ie];W[oi];B[ni];W[mg];B[ng];W[lg];B[kg];W[le];B[mh];W[ne]
;B[md];W[me];B[ge];W[gf];B[fe];W[he]C[pto:
Here begins the suicide. There is no territory here and capturing anything is almost impossible.  Risking one corner for this is not worth it.]
;B[hd];W[hf];B[gc];W[fd];B[gd];W[id]C[pto:
Trying to capture on stone while letting opponent attack one corner is never a good idea.]
;B[gb];W[eb];B[ee];W[ed];B[fb]C[lost the corner, i have already lost.

pto:
Tortoises are dangerous.];W[je];B[od];W[oe];B[hn];W[jn];B[kn]
;W[in]C[Black won in midgame.
I calculated that i won't be able to win anymore after losing the top left corner.
i think i need to maybe plan out my attack a little more. please give me some tips on this disastrous game.

pto:
It is really simple. Play more solid shapes. Watch out for cutting points and learn to smell bad aji instantly.

You were too fast and thin in this game for this opponent. Next time make sure you play too solid and strong, if you are too slow, then start to increce your speed but be carefull that you obey the speed limit.]
