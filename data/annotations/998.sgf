C[Revied by Alexey Guzeev, aga 5K* NNGS. All my comments are prepended with 'aga:'
===
I am playing black. Even though I lost by a significant amout
of points, I felt it was a good game. There was a fight through
the middle game (see move 126) that was instrumental in deciding
the outcome. I lost this fight. If I had won this fight, the
outcome would have been different. I am very interested in suggestions
on how I should have played this fight. I also made a large mistake
during the endgame (see move 196) that cost me a lot of points.
Suggestions on how I could have avoided that mistake would be
appreciated. Thank you.

aga: Yes, it was interesting enough game. But let me disagree with the fact that it was that fight which decided the game. The are two reasons to think me that way:

- even if b had captured w group, at that moment w moyo was so big and thick, so game would be quite even. And after that, w had a bit better center influence, and b had left several weak points to shift game into the white's favor.

- it was quite difficult to kill that group anyway, since b got quite a bit weaknesses all around at the moment of starting a fight. Once again, w's outside influence helped him to survive.

So, if you'd ask me for advices how to improve, I'd recommend you to pay more attention to your shape. Sometimes, it worth to spend sente on fixing own shape to prevent bad aji, sometimes it might be worthful to step back somewhat from your opponent, but be able to play more strong stones. And when you are strong anywhere, it's much much easier to kill invading opponent's groups, ones like you tried to kill in this game. During the game I also gave couple of nice moves possiblities; I hope that'll help you to attack more effeciently in the future. Also, some amount of comments regarding to yose was made.

Of course, take my advise carefully: never forget that 'too strong' means just 'overconcentrated'. And that my 5k is not somewhere close to even an amateur dan ;-)]
;B[dp];W[pq];B[cd]C[aga: This is wrong direction, bD17 would be correct. There are several reasons why:

- move played is stronger along left side, and weaker along top (being alone or after building shimari). So, b ends overconcentrated on left, and futher away from w. But since overall stone concentration is very low, overconcentration does not currently mean 'to be strong'.

- move played makes C10 point even more attractive for w then with other fusekis.

- move played has no good followup withing C10 area (to prevent possible w play there). For example, after playing bD10 it becomes obvious that bC16 is misplaced. From the other side, bD17 would allow high or low chineese fuseki to be played (with bD11 or bC11 respectively), along with many other interesting patterns like approaching top white stone first.]
;W[pc]C[aga: as an opposite, both white stones are aimed towards b position. (tho I wouldn't play this because both stones are low and quite far away from each other). Now, top is big for white, but is not so big for b. Other words, b lost possibility to play before white in the area where _both_ players would like to have influence.]
;B[ec]C[aga: this move is premature. Actually, one usually shouln't build a shimari unless there are already some friendly influence in front of it. Now, I'd expect wC10, and then b's upper stones would look overconcentrated badly (shimari faced white stone does not work much better then lone hoshi stone)]

(;W[qo]C[aga: this is bad. It makes bottom big for both, but it's black who has sente.
Aside C10 area, w would probably like to extend along bottom all the way to wF3, but he shouldn't actially do that, because it's hard to get sente attacking hoshi stone, and then b will be given possibility to play on left side. After that, right and top would look like miai.

See variation here for a w play.];B[qe]C[aga: If lower white 3-4 stone would be faced other direction, w would be happy to pincer b stone.]
;W[oe];B[rc]C[aga: it looks too early to go into the corner so low. How about bR16, and then bR17? After that, b would likely to have a good extending move along top (although left looks so strange without bD10...)

Personally, I'd approach wQ17 stone at 4-5 point, since there are no any b stones around R10/R4. 4-5 approach point would offer rich choice of possibilities, and better influence of b stones to be played during joseki.]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[pe];B[qf];W[qi]C[aga: this is success for w. b is almost enclosed, while w develops along sides. Probably, b should leave it's shape (it looks alive for me), and pincer w top stones extending from own stones along top (that b shimari oce again  looks improperly oriented, oh well).]
;B[qh]C[aga: For sure, it's a bad move. There is a proverb exists: "don't touch weak stone". Both touched and touching stones are likely to became much stronger, but it's obvious that w will have better gain from exchange.]
;W[ph];B[rh];W[ri];B[dj]C[aga: so, bR12 and bS12 made something like 4 points, while just adding wS11 stone there made profit that could be estimated to be at least 10-15 pts.

bD19 is big. But. But it makes k4 area even bigger for both (can you see how wR11 and wS11 stones made K4 even more attractive for w?). I guess now b would like to shift bC16 stone to hoshi, and move bE17 stone to k4 but alas! - that's impossible in go. Inefficiently played stones burden rest of game.]
;W[cn]C[aga: That looks like wrong direction for me. I expected approaching wF3 here. Of course,that would increase b's moyo, but w's one is even bigger then.]
;B[fp];W[bp];B[cq];W[hq]C[aga: so, white has to complicate things now.]
;B[jq]C[aga: if w stone wouldn't be backed up with correctly oriented shimary at LR, I'd recommend b to play bB3 here. But in this position pincering w looks urgent, otherwise w moyo could become incompetitive.]
;W[ip];B[mq];W[lp];B[cl]C[aga: no-no-no, b shouldn't tenuki! Giving up most part of bottom is too kind.

And there is no hope to kill w left stones, especially with bC8. It pushes w against bottom stones which are quite weak without bB3 played.]
;W[lq];B[ho];W[io];B[hp];W[iq];B[en]C[aga: ok, b forced w to increase his moyo even futher (nullifying all ajis of bK3 and bN3 stones) in hope to kill left w stones. Is gambling permitted in your region? ;-)

Anyhow, bE6 is incorrect. Still, bB3 would seriously limit w's base (and insuring b's life!). But considering locally, bE7 would be a good move. First of all, it would make better shape with bD4 & bF4 (and bC8 &bD10); also, if even w would escape, b would extend his moyo in the process, catching up w's one in size. Then after extending along top b would be back in game without any kills.]
;W[dm];B[em]C[aga: once again, it's wrong direction of blocking. B just pushes w towards his not-so-strong stones, building wall that faced nowhere in the process.]
;W[dl];B[cm]C[aga: it's too greedy. b stone here was short on liberties, but stone just added does not increase them.  bC9 here would be enough. b would be just happy to let w live in gote.]
;W[dn];B[co]C[aga: bad move, it creates some weaknesses in b's shape. it's still better to play bB3 locally. Otherwise, b should do something with bC7 & bC8 stones which are in danger.]
;W[bo];B[el]C[aga: ? consider variation at the next move. Isn't that looks terrible?

And black wall along E column is still have no value.]
(;W[bq];B[bm]C[aga: This makes bad shape, as you can see. After w's connect b still has only 3 liberties here, so variation I gave at previous move still applicable.]
;W[bn];B[cp]C[aga: aha, b regretted to play bC5. Loosing sente in such fights often means loosing a fight itself.]
;W[cr];B[dr]C[aga: What is it for? w already alive, and wH3 stone prevents b from making enough territory here to waste sente now. It's bigger to play at top, or even better to patch b's shape with bD9.

Anyhow, b's gamble failed, and he falled behind now.];W[bs]
;B[an]C[aga: This and next moves are just wasting ko threats.]
;W[ao];B[ar];W[ck];B[bk];W[am];B[bl]
(;W[dk]C[aga: too timid from w's side. wC10 is defnitelly THE suji here. Also, consider variant given here.]
;B[cj];W[aq];B[md]C[aga: E9 gap looks strange after bE6-bE8 stones played, and B10 has some aji, but bN16 is certainly big. Just probably somewhat too far from incorrectly oriented b's shimari. bK17 looks enough for me, if w answers wM17 it isn't that big after all, and gives b sente again.]
;W[lc];B[lf]C[aga: ? bN16 should be considered mistake and be abandoned. bN16 isn't cutting stone,so it isn't so big to save it. It's better to force w to capture it transforming own moyo into the terrotory in the process.]
;W[ld];B[me];W[hc];B[gd];W[hd];B[hf];W[bi];B[bj];W[cg];B[ci]
;W[de]C[aga: w plays nice sabaki here.];B[bf];W[ce];B[be];W[dd]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[cb]
(;B[bb]C[aga: see variant here, b is well ahead on semeai after connecting with bE18 instead.]
;W[eb];B[ca];W[fb];B[fc]C[aga: wrong move, it's just stealing own liberties. b should F16 here. But note, that killing w stones here can easily put those strange bN15 stones in danger.]
;W[gc];B[fd];W[ff];B[ge];W[gf];B[he];W[eh];B[cf];W[df];B[dg]
C[aga: unreasonable. b stone will be killed here for sure, and that would mean an eye for w. If b worries about bC10 stones (and it's enough reasons to worry about), it's better to just capture wB11 stone.]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[fg];B[ch]C[aga: sure, atari should be made from other side, if made at all.]
;W[bg];B[ag];W[bh]
(;B[ek]C[aga: b could connect underneath instead. See variation here.]
;W[fi];B[ei]C[aga: isn't bF10 here better? move played just asks w to run away faster.]
;W[fj];B[ej];W[jd]C[aga: it feels too defensive. If w is going to play here, wN17 would be more useful.]
;B[je]C[aga: unreasonable. W group is very stong to answer loan move in a way that b could have gain from exchange. bK14 is better since it's closer to center of action, i.e. running w stones.]
;W[ke]C[aga: Actually, w should not answer at all, it's better to escape faster toward center with invading stones.]
;B[gh];W[fh];B[ai];W[ef];B[ah]C[aga: As I already told, eye-stealing move in this shape is a must.]
;W[dg];B[gi]C[aga: Incorrect, no need to touch opponent stones, you can't stress his liberties anyway but for sure limits your own dame. What about bH11 instead?]
;W[gj];B[ij];W[hi];B[hh];W[hj];B[ih]C[aga: it's painful for b to left J11 open, but b is so weak himself...]
;W[ii]TR[ii][hi][hj][gj][fj][fi][dh][eh][fh][fg][gf][ff][ef]
[ce][dc][dd][de][df][dg][cg][bg][bh][bi]C[I think I should have been able to deny this group another eye.

aga: no way, your upper b group is just too weak. Look at the variants on the next white move.]
;B[ji]
(;W[ik];B[jj];W[hl];B[gk];W[gl];B[fk];W[hk];B[in];W[jk];B[lj]
;W[jm]C[aga: w could also connect here with wK6. Of course, bK3 have sone aji then, but K2 and K4 looks like miai to solve all that problems.]
;B[jn];W[gn]C[aga: direct playing wJ7 would be better for w.]
;B[hn];W[im];B[kl];W[jl];B[oi];W[jf];B[jg];W[ie];B[qm];W[pi]
;B[pk];W[mc]C[aga: definitelly big move.];B[oo];W[np];B[no]
;W[mo];B[mn];W[op];B[jo];W[jp];B[ng]C[aga: so, b is trying to create some territory in the center. There is a proverb exists: "There is no territory in the center"  :) B's touching moves bL8, bP11 are not doing good job. The problem is that even if b will get all that territory, he will be behind by about 20 pts anyway, The only hope for b is to kill w's wR11 stones starting with bQ13 for example, and if that fails - resign.]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[oj];B[ni];W[pj];B[ok];W[og];B[qc];W[pd];B[gq]
;W[hr];B[gr];W[if];B[ig];W[rl];B[ql]C[aga: I'd say that blocking other direction, preventing w from connection underneath and aiming for a monkey jump  is bigger.]
;W[rm];B[pb];W[ob]C[aga: if b was going to play bQ18 in sente, why don't to play bR18 then? but as soon as bQ18 is played, playing followup with bR19 is big.]
;B[po];W[qn];B[pn];W[nj];B[nk];W[mj];B[mk]C[aga: so, b managed to get here just above 10 points. Center territory is usually smaller than it looks like.]
;W[mi]C[aga: And yes, w have good attack here. And it looks like it's already too late to save all stones, at least 4 should be sacrificed. Problems started with P11 stone. When white answered to it, b hadn't worried to extend there, and so it became quite weak.]
;B[mh];W[li];B[kj]C[aga: ah, that touching bL8 stone is as good as dame.]

C[aga: at this point, game is over, but game record continues ;-)]

;B[ea];W[gb];B[pf];W[of];B[al];W[gm]C[aga: locally, wF6 instead would be more profitable. But wR18, wD1, wS13 are bigger.]
;B[go];W[qb];B[rb];W[qa]C[aga: It's better to take that stone. Why would b waste sente now to play bS19? And if he is not, w is left with bigger move here at wS19.]
;B[ra];W[pa];B[fa];W[ga];B[da];W[qk];B[hs];W[is];B[gs];W[ds]
;B[es];W[cs];B[er];W[sh]C[aga: wS13 is definitelly better.]
;B[sg]C[aga: bad move. next w move wT11 is lax, but how b would answer w S13 now?]
;W[si];B[rg];W[pm]C[aga: does not work, so it should be left as a ko threat.]
;B[pl];W[om];B[nn];W[fn];B[fo];W[do];B[eo];W[fe];B[ed];W[ee]
C[aga: again wasted ko threat.];B[hg];W[pg];B[an];W[qg];B[rf]
;W[rp]C[aga: ? ?? ???

IF b could mess here something, this move had to be played long time ago. But he actually can't live here, so no need for w to decrease own territory. Oh well, w is more than well ahead, but this move is awful anyway.]
