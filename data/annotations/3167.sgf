C[Chris: Hi! This is the first time I ask somebody to review my game. I haven't been playing Go for very long. I was black for this game I played over the internet. Thank you very much for taking the time and helping me improve my play.

Best wishes from Munich, Germany!];B[pe];W[cp];B[dc];W[pq];B[di]
C[This looks like part of the Chinese style fuseki However a move in the corner is bigger at this stage. (q5,r5 or q17) If you wanta move on the side then k16 is bigger than the move you made.]
;W[ce]C[A premature invasion -  the moves I mentioned earlier plus e4 or k4 look better for white here.]

(;B[gc]C[with d11 already on the board I would have thought you could afford to be MUCH more aggressive here. Perhaps you were thinking of a standard joseki where black would play this move  - however this would only happen after white had played f15. He hasn't done that yetso you could afford to play at e15 or thereabout  yourself. White would have to defend and you could build a big framework at the top. See big variation.or you could have played at c16 to secure the corner and make white heavy. (See small variation)]
;W[pc]C[White is spraying weak stones around. You can still attack the c15 stone. He will probably end in gote so you can return to the top left corner afterwards!]
;B[qo]C[Chris: Should I have reacted to this, ensuring the connection to the upper-left corner?

The best reaction is to attack his upper left corner stone first.  You should come out with sente and a strong outer position in the top left.]
;W[qp];B[ql]C[q5 would be natural here - followed by a three space extension to r9 (or maybe further because of your q15 stone]
;W[qd];B[qe]LB[oc:X][nd:X]MA[qg]C[Chris: I'm not sure about this move. Maybe it would have been better to do a wider move to R13 or O16? Or would a more aggresive move to P17 be better?

This is one of your best moves so far - but it would work even better if you had played on q5 also. Add a stone in the centre and it is an ideal formation.

The other suggestions you make are inferior];W[ee];B[cg]C[Keeping him out of the corner with c17 or peeping at d14 look better here.

This move doesn't build much of a strucutre , doesn't drive white in a direction you want  and leaves the corner as an option for him (which he took a few moves later).]
;W[fg];B[ge]C[no point in building strength in this direction now because of white's stones  in the top right which are strong and difficult to confine.]
;W[bc]C[and white can still take the corner to assist with life.]
;B[cb];W[bb];B[de]MA[bb][bc][ce]C[Chris: I knew, that I probably wouldn't be able to cut him, but I wanted to use this battle to build up walls. What do you think about this move?

Was there a way to capture the marked stones?

No in fact they are almost alive even if you cut them off.

You are better making an extension towards the top right to make some profit from your stones on g17 and g15.

If I was white here I would play as in the variations.]

;W[mc]C[Now both sides have hardened their positionsand the weakest stones are the black ones around d11 white should attack them from below  combining with an extension from his c4 stone

since he didn't you could defend them now by extending  - c7 looks about right]
;B[od]TR[ql][qo]C[This move  and the sequence that follows is your best bit of the game!

You are building a winning framework on the right. This wall works nicely with the triangled stones]
;W[oc];B[md];W[kc];B[jc]LB[kd:x]C[l16 would be better here. Don't worry about the territory white is getting - just build your own framework]

(;B[ln]MA[lj][mj]C[Chris: Would an extension to N10 or an attack M10 be better here?

Yes - the extension is best because it is solider - and you should be trying to consolidate now. You are about 20 pts up at this stage.]

MA[gm]C[Chris: What do you think about G7 instead of this move?
The move you played was sente so it is no loss to play.
   g7 doesn't look so good though

f8 looks better - on the boundary of two moyos.];W[ep];B[bo]

(;B[fl]MA[fm][gm][an][bo]C[Chris: Again, wouldn't F7 or G7 have been better? Or close to the edge with A6? I probably shouldn't have played B5 at all?

F8 looks best in this area see variations

You're right about b5 - b6 would be better here with the monkey jump a3 if white ignores it.]

n8 is only 2 pts with a 2 pt threat - worth no more than 4 pts although maybe slightly more valuable than the move you played.
n2 is a 6 pt move - one of you should have played it much earlier]

OK that is the kind of cockup we all make sometimes - the real error is playing here rather than n2.]

[js]C[Chris: Do you have any suggestions concerning my overall play? What should I work on or watch out for?

Thank you again for taking the time to review my game.

Overall you seem too concerned with local tactics and don't attach enough importance to territory and the board as a whole.

Most attacks don't kill their target group. The trick is to attack in such a way that you gain territory or influence as a side effect.

In the opening try to anticipate the "shape" of the board after a sequence has ended and go for sequences that give you territory or influence  (or deprive your opponent of it).

Try playing a quieter less tactical game for a while to get the feel of this (if your opponent is very aggressive you may be unable to carry this through but you should end up fighting in more favourable circumstances that way).

Later in the game try to estimate the likely scores for each side and try to just do enough to win by 10 points. You could have avoided you two big mistakes in this game if you hadn't been struggling (needlessly) for every point at the time.

Finally in the endgame try to count the size of each move and play the biggest point. Remember that a hane on the first line is worth 2 pts whilst on the second it is worth 6. Most points in the middle of the board at the end are only worth 1 or 2 pts. If the sequence is sente for either side then the value is doubled (provided the threat is big enough - which depnds on what else isaround at the time. Note that gote on the second line is still worth more than sente on the first. Remember that sente means FINISHING the sequence in sente so your opponent has to make the final move - it isn't enough if he just has to answer the first one.

If you are ahead then play safe in the endgame  - don't take risks. If you are behindthen you may need to be more ambitious to stand a chance.

If this counting business seems too complicated to do whilst playing on the internet in real time try using a turn based server like dragon for a few games. This will give you the opportunity to count and explore variations at will with no time worries.]
