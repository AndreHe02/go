AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[From Submitter:

I am a new Go player and this is my first game.  Since I had a large
handicap I just played defensively, trying to protect the head start I
was given.  I am interested in any comments you can offer about
stupid mistakes, wasteful moves, things I could have done better,
missed opportunities to attack white, etc.  Thanks!

WhitePlayer [20k\]: hi

I'll do my best to point out what I see.]N[Introduction];W[jd]
C[BlackPlayer [?\]: hi WhitePlayer
BlackPlayer [?\]: I am new to Go, this is my first game.  I hope you don't mind.
WhitePlayer [20k\]: no problem
WhitePlayer [20k\]: go on
WhitePlayer [20k\]: :)
BlackPlayer [?\]: I see we are playing a timed game...

Here white is trying to make a basic framework in which he will actually create territory later, this framwork is most easily made in the corners, but you already have all 4 of them guarded, so he's using his next best option, the sides. The center is not good for territory, because you have to create all 4 of the walls for your space, and it takes so many moves to do so that often your points there will not compensate enough for the number of turns you'd have to spend to create that territory.]
;B[jf]TR[gc][mc][gd][md]C[With my previous statement in mind, keeping white out of the center isn't really the goal here, it would be to preven him from spreading on the sides. I'll be using the triangle to mark other moves that would have been good for you.]
;W[le]C[White is being rather aggressive];B[lg]TR[mc]C[white's right side is weak due to how far from the edge he is, this move exposes that weakness and allows you to creep under him and mess up his framework]
;W[hf]TR[ie]C[WhitePlayer [20k\]: usually its enough time

White left this opening, he's playing too aggressively];B[gd]
C[Good move, you've begun to build your own base, which is the main point in the beginning of the game]
;W[hd];B[ge]TR[gc]C[Not bad, this also works];W[he];B[gf];W[gg]
;B[hg];W[ig]
(;B[jp]TR[hg]C[Here the marked stone is about to be captured. Instead of simply letting it die, it is best to at least use it as a sacrifice to gain momentum. See my variation as to my point.]
;W[gc];B[fd];W[dg]C[The variation I mentioned earlier would be very helpful here to seperate the white stone from the rest of the group.]
;B[ch]C[This is fine];W[eh];B[df];W[ef]C[WhitePlayer [20k\]: where are you from?]
;B[cf];W[ed];B[ee];W[ec];B[dh]TR[fe]C[White's threatening to seperate and kill your group, this move would've helped to connect them and keep them alive]
;W[ff];B[nc];W[fc]TR[fd][gd][ge][gf]C[Marked stones are dead now]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[me];W[ld];B[md];W[lb];B[mc];W[kf];B[kg];W[jg]
;B[lf];W[kh];B[ke];W[kd];B[dm];W[mh];B[lh];W[li];B[mf];W[ji]
TR[mg][ng][og][nh][oh][ni][oi]C[The marked area is very important right now. If white comes in here your points in the area will shrink rapidly, while if you create a wall you'll have the entire corner for your points.]
;B[mi];W[mj];B[ni];W[nh];B[oh];W[oi];B[og];W[nj];B[pi];W[oj]
C[BlackPlayer [?\]: sorry I didn't see you asked a question
BlackPlayer [?\]: I am from Israel];B[pm]C[BlackPlayer [?\]: you?

That exchange wasn't horrible, white didn't come in too far and your framework on the sides is taking shape nicely.]
;W[ol]C[WhitePlayer [20k\]: poland];B[pl];W[pk]C[BlackPlayer [?\]: sorry for going so slowly]
;B[qk]C[WhitePlayer [20k\]: its ok];W[ok];B[rj];W[ql];B[qm]

;W[kb];B[pb];W[la];B[na]C[All there went well];W[di];B[ci];W[ei]
;B[cj]TR[cg]C[You could have gone ahead and played here, since it forces white's response, then come back and secured your stones.]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[eg];B[dc];W[fe];B[de];W[db];B[cb];W[da];B[bc]
;W[ca];B[ba];W[eb];B[sk];W[ej];B[dk]TR[ek]C[Here would have been fine]
;W[ek];B[el];W[fl];B[fm];W[gk]C[BlackPlayer [?\]: what happens when I run out of time?]

(;B[go]TR[gl]C[WhitePlayer [20k\]: you have 5 byo-yomi

Here forces white to secure and allows you more momentum, see my variation]
;W[gm];B[gn]C[WhitePlayer [20k\]: it means that you have to move within 30 sec
BlackPlayer [?\]: thank you];W[hn];B[ho];W[im];B[in];W[jn];B[io]
TR[gm][hm]C[Could have captured here and atari'd the marked stone at the same time.]

;W[no];B[ns];W[mr];B[os];W[mo]
(;B[pq]C[You have a large infiltration point available, see my variation to use it]
;W[cq]TR[co][fq]C[This is a known weakness of the stone on the 4x4 point, it needs other supporting stones such as the places marked to properly secure it]
;B[dq];W[cr];B[cp];W[bq];B[bp];W[ar];B[er]TR[dr]C[Here would have been fine]
;W[bs]TR[aq][cs]C[He's not technically alive until he plays one of the points marked]
;B[fq];W[dr];B[ds];W[ap];B[ao];W[aq]C[He's alive, now it's just a matter of not letting him break out of the corner and further reduce your territory]
;B[bn];W[fs];B[es];W[fr];B[eq]C[WhitePlayer [20k\]: is it really youres first go game?
BlackPlayer [?\]: yes
BlackPlayer [?\]: but I have been reading a lot
BlackPlayer [?\]: I played 9x9 against the computer a few times
BlackPlayer [?\]: but its not the same
WhitePlayer [20k\]: no it isnt
BlackPlayer [?\]: this is very exciting for me I appreciate your playing]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[rc];B[qb]C[WhitePlayer [20k\]: for now it seems you are winning
BlackPlayer [?\]: I'm not sur e how you can tell, but I had a big head start wit h6 stones!]

For this to be your first game you are either very gifted in abstract strategy games or have read several volumes of Go related material. I've seen people play many games before coming to enough of an understanding of the game to progress to your level.

Congratulations on the win and I hope to see you online sometime!
