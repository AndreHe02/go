C[Ijuset: Hello I am ijuset, I have been 2kyu for a while. I will be reviewing for both, especially for black]

;B[qj];W[om];B[oj];W[qc]LB[jj:A]TR[dj]SQ[df]C[Ijuset: This is a bit early for white. I think D10 is bigger, it also attacks D14. Tengen is an other oppurtunity. Imagine a white or black stone on K10, makes good shape for both side.]

C[Ijuset: This move is usually not ommited, hane is big on line 2.]

(;W[nm];B[mm]C[Ijuset: But yes, this is good and severe too]
;W[ml];B[nk];W[mn];B[lm];W[no];B[oq]TR[ln]C[Ijuset: Too safe? Why not M6? Black is safe at corner]
;W[ko];B[ln]C[Ijuset: This move is too obvious. It may be a good ko threat but not a good sente. White is making good shape afterwards. Black triangle is losing life]
;W[lo];B[mp]TR[lq][oq]C[Ijuset: Good move for building shape in sente]

(;B[jd]TR[ke]C[Ijuset: This move is solid but does not defend one side clearly√ß Maybe attachment at L15 would be better?]

[nf][of][mg][ng][og][qq][rq][nr][or][ns][os]C[Ijuset: Now white is stealing points. As can be seen black really needs points there because white has a bit more solid area.]

C[Ijuset:  D16 is not standard for W.];W[dd];B[cf];W[be];B[fg]
;W[fd];B[cl]C[Ijuset: Maybe N16 would be thinkable, L16 seems risky to me. From this point W makes some mistakes and Black takes advantages. So I usually wrote comments on W mistakes.]

Ijuset: Good game. By the way your learn two times more from your loss games, so next time you may send a game you lost, just an advice :) Have fun!]
