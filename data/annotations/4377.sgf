C[Hi there!

My name is Utku Üzülmez. I am an 14k player from Istanbul, Turkey.
As your strength is pretty close to mine, so please don't expect a highly accurate revision. 
But I will do my very best.

Generally, I liked your opening and skill. I enjoyed the review very much.
Also, I can suggest "Life&Death Problems" and "Studying Tesuji" beside more and more playing for improving yourself.

Best wishes...

utku.];B[pd]C[Hi,

I play black in this game. I don't know what kyu I have. I think it is around 15-18 kyu. Actually I learn GO for about half year (self learning by reading books). My opponent should be around 15 kyu. I would like to know what should I improve. Is it OK for opening?

Thankyou for your review.

Regards,
