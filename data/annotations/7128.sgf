queenofgo [3k\]: TGL

hello reviewer
 i'm yigit (queenofgo) 3k in kgs. this was the first game  i played in the TGL (turkish go league)
 Would you tell me please where are my mistakes in the game?
and which one is the losing move?
thanks a lot for your comments and suggestions.

Hi :)
Its nice to see a serious game.];B[pd]C[queenofgo [3k\]: iyi oyunlar]
;W[dp];B[dc];W[de];B[qp];W[op];B[po]C[This kosumi kind of doesn't exist. Since you have the ladder you response is good.]
;W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[qm];W[lq]TR[kq]C[I would go to l3 sine you can go to s2 safely. But its a detail.]
;B[ee];W[ef];B[ed];W[df];B[jc];W[gf]C[
bad move?

No, there is nothing wrong about this move. It only would have been if black had stron possition on the bottom left, but you are there.
Whether this is good now only depends on whether you can use influence.]
;B[hd]C[Hard to choose a move here, huh?];W[dm]C[But this looks ok.]
;B[fq]TR[nn]C[This direction is wrong. The main thing now is your left-central moyo thats building up and he is helping you. This side is not that important, because its open from black q5 stone. Possible black strategy would be suppressing your possition by o6 etc. and building a moyon of his own, then going for the bottom left corner.]

(;W[hq]C[Also wrong. Two reasons: 
- Your bottom right is already very strong and desn't need this extension. 
- You are pushing him into your moyo and destroying it.

Now, the proverb says attack from your weak side, which now is the corner. This would lead the first approach - blocking from the corner side and making him extend towards your strong possition - var. 1.
I like this most, because it cannot be bad and it lets you decide what to do further, you can still attack or build the moyo.

Other way around would be building the moyo for the price of making him strong - pressing him down to the side - var. 2]
;B[cq]C[Hmmm, I would do this as black, I would be too afraid of the moyo. If he wanted to, he could have go there right away.]

(;W[io]C[Uf uf, what kind of move is this?!?];B[lm];W[ml]C[And this is very bad. What are you trying? He aint gonna die now when he's out. You are making him run into your moyo and telling him "Destroy my points, I don't want them!'

And besindes, there must have been a meaning behind the move, so why did it end up 100% useless in 5 moves?]
;B[jm];W[hm]C[Now you defend 10 points...];B[nm]
(;W[mo];B[mm]C[
now, he's got a thick wall. what was the mistake?


Hey, he got a wall, you got it right. Maybe its because there is a black stone on n7 and not yours?
No matter what you do or want, you must cut in such a place, because no matter what happens, it can never be worse than it is now.]
;W[kn]C[You got here 20 points, which doesn't sound bad, problem is that these were already yours before his anvasion started.]

(;B[pj]C[This is too small, that area is already secure. The right way now is to "play on the edge of two moyos".

c16 is still in reserve, the time to play there is near.];W[ld]
C[Bad move. Its risky. And you give black a target, which he can use to erase your left side.]

(;B[me]C[He seens to be woried about his right side points, but thats too narrow-thinking.]

(;W[lf]C[
here, i wanted to play flexibly and played the sequence.

You must understand that flexibility doesn't mean throwing away your stones withnout compensation. It means throwing them away, but with the oponent paying dearly for taking them. Now you simply discarded your last move, which you therefor didn't have to play at all.]

(;B[jd];W[ih];B[hg];W[hf]C[To me black seems to have more territory now. So trying to live in this area is unnecesary and wrong.]

is this one correct?

Its important to have eyes on the side. If black goes to c10 and c8 he has a good shape for an eye in sente, so I would choose the hane, but it's not deciding move.]

(;W[mf]C[I will end the comment here, since its already obvious how this will end.

Making large moyos is nice, but its critical to know how to attack for that to work well. 

But good play :) Good luck in your games.];B[nh];W[mh];B[ng]

Killing the group is not the purpouse, because it will probably not happen and focusing only on killing would loose the game when it lives. So you are not killing, but chasing and that's the tool to make territory and a superior power to destroy all the territory black has.

A side note: the reason for not playing p9 now is that you might like some q8 instead, the corner w group might not be alive yet.]
