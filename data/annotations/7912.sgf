C[    Hello :-)
 I lost that game, but I was keeping thinking that he had done some mistakes and that I had an easy game. Could you explain me some errors of feeling I had ?

N: hello, my comments will be preceded by "N:". In this game you made a big mistake in direction in the opening, the fight was not easy but you helped your opponent twice by cutting at an impossible place. Your last big mistake was failing to capture his string of stones.

Kind regards,

;W[pk];B[ql];W[om];B[pn];W[pl];B[qk]C[These last two moves are supposed to be good for white, but maybe it was not a good idea at the beginning to play r14 and p14 ? Maybe r10 or so is better ? I wanted to try ... And here how can the black corner be efficiently attacked ?

N: personally i would prefer the variation i showed earlier. About the black bottom corner: i think it would be best to give it to black and get some stones on the outside to make black look overconcentrated.]

;B[cd];W[de];B[df]C[This is not joseki (at least not on eidogo :-) ), was my counter good ?

N: your moves seemed logic, I don't know of any good counter. But i think your mistake was earlier in the direction of play.]

(;W[kg]TR[ij]C[I was feling confident here, because he had two weak groups and I had potential on the lower left.

N: the principle is good. However, next black will reinforce his lump of stones and in fact the marked stone is still relatively strong and your connection in the centre also looks week. 
In the variation an idea wich might work better.];B[le];W[dm]

N: I can understand his choise. If you feel like you are ahead, you want to minimize risks. probably he was afraid of his centre group.]

What correction could there be ? And were white's moves reasonnable ?]
