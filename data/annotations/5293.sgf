;B[nd];W[cf];B[cm]C[I'm not very good at opening, so i'm not sure, is this move good enough. Should i strengthen right side?
[yes, this is the first move that stands out as less than best. White play at D6 would put pressure on. Better for Black to play around Q11 to take advangage of big wall on line 16.\]]
;W[jj];B[lc];W[kc];B[lb];W[kb];B[mb];W[pj]C[[that exchange was better for White making wall at L, then stopping Black from making best use of wall at 16. Black only gained fewer points than White by fully securing top right, which it mostly already had.\]]

[yes, good play and J18 is better\]];W[ib];B[ie];W[he];B[jf]

;W[fe]C[[Watch the effects of your move. This 'forced' W to make good territory on top. Black having a connected living extension is somewhat valuable too. Perhaps one could have been extended out around K12 before W sealed it.\]]
;B[ef];W[eg];B[ne];W[gm];B[ee];W[ed];B[dd]C[Here i tried to do something in upper left corner, but failed. I thought about cutting at H16, but decided, that i will fail. G17 also seemed good to me. And i was not sure would i be able to live at C17.]
;W[de];B[ki];W[cd];B[li];W[kj];B[lh]C[[Playing N11 also almost certainly kills the W group and makes more territory and influence.\]]

C[[excellent. make territory in corners, then sides first.\]]
;W[er];B[dq]C[I allowed invasion and replied not very good to it. Haven't found a way to kill the white group.
[W at E2 was a poor move allowing them to be separated.\]];W[gq]

;W[bl];B[el]C[Attempte to reduce white center. May be i could connect with my stones on upper side. Haven't found a way.]

;W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[pi];W[qj];B[ph]C[I wanted R11, but was afraid that after W Q12 he could kill my stones by connecting at N11 or M13.]
;W[qi];B[rh];W[ri];B[rf]C[[that was a bad sequence. If B played S13 instead of S12, then W defends, B doesn't need to defend against W's defence and can play in a new area again. This is worh much more than the few extra points.\]]
;W[qp];B[qq]C[I allowed white to take too much on right side. Was there a way to avoid this, i wonder.]
