shichi [1d\]: hi

Thanks for reviewing! This game went wrong early on and I felt like I was playing in completely the wrong direction. There was a fight at the top and I think I lost control of the game somewhere.

[EV\] Comments by your reviewer will be marked like this.  This game was decided by fighting, not strategy.  The best way to get stronger at fighting is to play stronger players or study tesuji.  Oh,  if you catch yourself about to make an empty tringle, look really hard for a better alternative.]

LB[dh:A]C[Is a move on the left better? I couldn't see a good move.

[EV\] The joseki continues with a W extension at A on the left.  W could also consider pushing up at L16 before B gets to play in that area.  Tenuki is probably not good, because ...]
;B[ch]C[[EV\] This nice move threatens to undercut W base on the side.]
;W[eg];B[mc]C[This was a very awkward move. What should I do?

[EV\] See variations for a few ideas.]
(;W[kd];B[ke]
(;W[ld]C[[EV\] This move is terrible shape (empty triangle).  I think W should hane here and fight harder.  See variations for some ideas.  I really do not know what is best, but this cannot be it :)]
;B[le];W[md];B[nc];W[ff];B[fe];W[me];B[oe];W[mg]LB[if:A]C[[EV\] This move seems a little slack.  B has made a lot of territory in the corner, so W must get compensation by attacking the weak B group.  I would start with the vital point at A to see how B responds.]
;B[kg];W[if]C[[EV\] Good, not too late.];B[hg]C[[EV\] Overplay, as the response shows.]

;W[je];B[db];W[cb];B[gb];W[fc]C[I misread here

[EV\] Oops.  W had at least a ko to kill B, but instead B lives with a large capture, so this should be a game-losing move.  No need really to look further for the reason for the loss.]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[kb];W[lb];B[ib];W[ka];B[hb]C[Here I knew that M14 worked to connect my group but i thought it was too slow.

[EV\] I think it is your best play.  Of course all moves lose from here if B plays well, but by capturing W secures all his weak stones at once and can play strongly afterwards.]

(;W[ki];B[mh];W[ng];B[li]C[[EV\] B should connect solidly, to eliminate the M14 capture.]
;W[kj];B[oi];W[oh]C[M14 still works but I thought it was still no good]
;B[nj];W[qh];B[pg];W[ph];B[qj]LB[pc:A]C[[EV\] W has gained a bit up to here.  Now is the time to play M14 to capture the two stones.  Then let B worry about his thin shape on the outside.  W will even be strong enough to try a severe invasion of the corner at A.  If B defends the corner first, W is still behind, but has chances because of his superior thickness across most of the board.]
;W[pi]C[[EV\] Another empty triangle.  This should alert you that something is probably wrong.  W loses a lot floundering around here, making the B outside thick instead of thin.  Much better to simply play M14 and live.  No further comments.]
;B[pj];W[ni];B[oj];W[mi];B[lj];W[mj];B[mk];W[nh];B[lh]C[M14 still works but then black secures the centre]
;W[ij];B[kk];W[ob]C[White can live but feels a long way behind so I thought I would try something in the corner, which fails completely. Basically the game is over now and I have no idea how it got so out of hand. any advice you can give is much appreciated! Thanks!]
