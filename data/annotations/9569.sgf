Often I found myself in a situation with a pretty huge moyo wich I can't effectively use. Usually I don't try to create such positions intentionally, they just occur:) This game is a good illustation. Though I did a couple of sloppy mistakes in the end, the outcome was predecided long ago, about 80th move I think.

My questions are:
1) How can one manage moyos better (at the example of this game)
2) When is it better to fight for territory rather then trying enclose your opponent and build a wall (at the expample of this game)

I'm very thankful in advace, looking forward to get enlightened by your review!
-----------------------------

judicata: This is a good game for review. I have to admit, moyo games are difficult for me, too. Among other skills, you have to be comfortable with allowing your opponent to take the lead in "solid" territory. You also have to welcome invasions--especially deep ones--while thinking carefully about how to respond.

Making territory in the center is very difficult. You have to be creative and flexible, and there aren't really standard patterns to follow. When you establish some strength, try to drive your opponent toward it. Use any thickness you develop from attacking to attack and reduce other areas of the board.

Your second question is difficult to answer in a helpful way. You should choose thickness when the benefit you get from it is worth more than the territory you could acquire. Making this decision requires careful analysis and no small amount of guts.

Now, about this game: I think white's downfall in this game was more about not making good shape than about managing a moyo. Two examples are fairly early in the game (around moves 18 and 32). Others are made later in the middle game, and prove to cost white the game.

I also think white had chances to win much further into the game than you think. :)]
;B[pd];W[dd]C[I don't think you decided to play a moyo game from the very beginning. If you wanted to play a moyo game from the start, you'd want to play in the lower left to prevent the diagonal fuseki.

But, like I said, I dont' think white decided to play a moyo game from the beginning--which is perfectly fine.]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[nq];W[qn]LB[pn:A]C[White's response is absolutely fine, of course.

If white wanted to start a moyo game A would be better. I understand that it wasn't white's decision at this point, so this is perfectly fine (I'd probably make the same move).]
;B[pr];W[qq];B[kq];W[nc]LB[dj:B][cn:A]C[I wouldn't call this a huge mistake, but in a position like this, approaching at A is generally better. This prevents black from getting a good position by playing around A or B.]
;B[oc]LB[jd:A]C[This kick by black is generally considered a mistake unless black has a stone around A (there are some other situations where this may be ok, but this isn't one of them).]
;W[nd];B[qf];W[jd]LB[jc:A]C[Good resposne by white. I might have played at A instead, but the game move is fine.]
;B[fc]LB[cf:A]C[Usually, it is better for black to approach at A.]

(;W[dc]LB[ec:A]C[This is the right idea--to put pressure on black's F17 stone. But here, in contrast to black's move at p17, the kick at A is better. See variation.]
;B[ic]LB[hc:A]C[Moves like black's here, playing the diagonal of your opponent's stone, is usually not good--it is like a contact move, which makes your opponent stronger. Black at A is probably better.]

(;W[ie]LB[jc:B][id:A]C[Here, a simple push at A is better, leaving white in a stronger position. True, you usually don't want to play contact moves while attacking, but here it keeps black contained. See variations. B is also possible.

This is a pretty important point--white makes two moves like this in this game.]
;B[jc];W[kc];B[kb];W[lc];B[eb];W[db]LB[cj:A][cn:B]C[Unless you think you can kill black, or at least keep attacking severely (that is, you can keep sente), I would respond to E18 by playing around A or B. White's move at D18 is small at this point in the game. True, black could invade and take away some points, but there are bigger moves.]
;B[da]C[It can be difficult to ignore moves like this but there are bigger moves elsewhere (again, unless white thinks he can keep attacking black severely).]
;W[ca];B[ea];W[cb];B[cf];W[ch]C[I like this move; black would love for white to play something like C15.]

(;B[bd]C[Black should run out and try to cut white's groups. See variation.]

(;W[ef]C[Again the idea is right, but I like the direct attachment better because it leaves white with a more solid position.

I quickly played out a few variations. They shouldn't be considered perfect, but as a few ideas.]
;B[cg];W[dg]LB[dh:A]C[Did you consider A instead?];B[bh];W[ci]
;B[bi];W[cj];B[bj];W[ck]SQ[ie][ef]C[Do you see how the marked stones seem out of place? Compare to the variation.]

(;B[qi]C[This is a good place to estimate relative territory.

I estimate roughly 35 points for black. Excluding the center, white only has about 12-15 points, plus komi. Considering white's influence, I'd say the game is roughly even--I think white is ahead if he can use framework effectively.]

(;W[cp]LB[dn:C][fq:B][gq:A]C[Nowadays, this attachment is usually used when black has a stone at A.

I think B is better. Here, the question is, where are black's points? Black can't secure the corner with a single move, and can't make many points on the left side.

White C might also be possible, but I'm not comfortable with the move because white doesn't have any potential territory on the left, and black would get a lot of points on the bottom. It is still an idea to consider. See variation.]
;B[cq];W[do]LB[co:A][dq:B]C[Because black's potential is on the bottom, I don't like this response, which gives black a chance to get the corner and start securing points on the bottom.  White A is simpler, but white can start more of a fight with B.  I don't like the results for white either way, which is why I don't recommend C4 here.]
;B[dq];W[ep]LB[eo:A]C[This move leaves too many cutting points. What happens if black cuts immediately? It could get complicated, but I don't think it is good for white. I tried some variations, though there are almost certainly better ways for both sides.]

(;B[eq];W[eo];B[co];W[cn];B[bo]C[Black should take.];W[bn];B[bp]
;W[gp];B[gq]
(;W[hp]C[The hane seems better for white here. See variation. White helps black secure a lot of points in the game. Sometimes this is the right approach in a moyo game, but you have to be sure that the influence you get in exchange is worth it. 

Here, because white's moyo is still wide open, I don't think white gets enough.]
;B[hq];W[ip];B[iq];W[ge]LB[ph:B][oi:A][ko:C]SQ[ef]C[This is too slow at this point. There are probably better moves, but A-C are ideas.

White also has some bad aji because of the marked stone. I don't think it is fatal at this point, but it is a bit tricky. See variation. 

Anyway, if white's move removed the aji, it would be a little better, but it doesn't.]

(;B[hj]C[When you're playing a moyo game, this sort of move should make you very happy. This is exactly what you're hoping your opponent will do--invade deep inside your moyo.

Black's move is too deep--black should play to reduce.  If black plays to reduce white's center potential, I think the game is better for black.]

(;W[il]C[The goal here should be to push black to white's thickness. White is thick on the top, left, and bottom. This move lets black run in the only direction white isn't strong--the right side.]
;B[jj]
(;W[ih];B[ik]
(;W[gl]LB[hl:B][jl:A]C[Here, white generally has two options--A or B. See variations.]

;W[fi];B[hi];W[hh];B[ej];W[el];B[kn];W[ko];B[lo];W[kp]C[This move leaves a weakness--see variation.]

(;B[lp];W[jp];B[jq]C[If you estimate the territory, I think white still has a chance to win this game.]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[qj]
(;W[pj]C[See variation.

White makes a few moves here that leave unnecessary weaknesses, and I think these actually cost white the game.

I played out some test variations from move 95, and I think the game was still close at this point.]

White could have played to take a big lead earlier in the mid-game, but ultimately lost because of weaknesses left behind in the late middle game and the endgame.
