C[Dear reviewer, I played as black here,as I have been just studying the opening, I would appreciate any comments on my fuseki. Also, I played some bad moves, but failed to capitalize on my opponents slack moves, and in the end I had to resign after losing a crucial group,I have sentenced myself to doing life and death problems, but it is more a case of not looking everywhere and judging some of the subtelties I had a relatively long time limit,I can see many things I done wrong, so maybe I need to change my mental attitude,try and be more calm and objective instead of too emotional.

Anyway, thank you in advance];B[pd]C[AP:  Hey there Odif.  My name is Alex Prairie and I will be reviewing your game.  It seems you play the chinese high opening, which I am somewhat unfamiliar with, but I will do my best to comment.  Personally I usually play the chinese low opening.  I hope you enjoy the review.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[jd];B[jp]C[Odif:is f3 better?
AP:  Whenever I play the chinese opening, I play k4 as well.  F3 is another option, based on preference.  Both f3 and k4 are okay but f3 can lead to complications such as a pincer.]
;W[nk]C[AP:  This move isn't very good.  Its okay to cap the middle stone under the chinese low opening, but this stone is now floating and achieving not very much.]

(;B[om]C[Odif: was this okay
AP:  I  dont like this move, I would stick to a 1 point jump to Q7]
;W[po]C[AP:  This move is bad, hes putting himself in the middle of your strength, and on the 4th line, which makes it more difficult fo rhim to make life.]

(;B[op]C[AP:  Not sure about this move, it might be okay, but i would steal his base by playing r4 and then chasing him.]
;W[oo];B[no];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq]
(;B[nn]C[AP:  I would play at S2 instead of O6, in order to keep him struggling for life.

I think the cut at o6 works out, its complicated though, see variation.]
;W[rr];B[pr];W[qm];B[ql];W[pm];B[rl];W[rm];B[fq];W[dn]C[Odif: up to here I felt happy, and I had sente.]
;B[cf]C[Odif,: Up until now i felt that I was ok, maybe this is what started to get me into trouble.]
;W[ci];B[cc]C[Odif: maybe i should just run out and avoid giving white too much thickness

AP:  I like c17, its a fine move];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be]
;B[bc];W[ce];B[fc];W[ge]C[Odif:It seems, that my next few moves only get me into trouble, but I wanted to stop him making an enormous moyo, however, i give lots on left side and damage my lower territory, and set the course for the rest of the game as I get more and more desperate]

(;B[ej]C[Odif:this  is not the time for this i think, is there anything better,I was worried about a too big W moyo, this is another crucial turning point.

AP:  Theres a pretty important move to be made at g17, however, if youre going ot make a move in this area, i would personally shoot for d10.  Walking him on the third line doesn't get him very many points, see variation]
;W[dk];B[fn]C[Odif:my plan, but maybe it is unsound

AP:  This move is a bit loose, lets him invade more easily, but its the right idea for sure]
;W[iq]C[Odif: I didnt expect this

AP:  I dont like this invasion, but i'd have a hard time stopping it so i cant call it bad.

AP:  I think i prefer your move at j4 to the move at k3, but perhaps theres something better, see variation

AP:  I played it out a few times, i dont know how it would work, but perhaps just k3 then tape the corner, as in variation.]

AP:  Yes, but this is one i might make too, easy to miss.  In the variation I show a way that you can get something out of your cut at d5]

C[Odif: g8 kills B

(;B[gn]C[Odif:no];W[gl];B[gi];W[fk]C[Odif:I resign here, I missed many opportunities in this game, but after having played several bad moves, i was in desperation all or nothing mode and I missed my chances to punish his mistakes.

AP:  Most of your moves are good, you seemed to have lost the games on your mistakes.  

Your fuseki seems fine, but if you want to learn the chinese Fuseki very well, try reading "The Chinese Opening"
By Masao Kato.  I read it, and it helped a lot.

If you have anymore questions, you can talk to me on kgs, hope you enjoyed the review]
