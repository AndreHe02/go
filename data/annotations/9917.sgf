;B[kc];W[oq]C[J: hmmm I think some extension around F17 is better here, not a strong follow up for P3]
;B[qm];W[pn]C[J: now definitely I'd go for M3 or so];B[qn];W[qq]

;B[lq]C[J: ... but this is a strong reply];W[rp]C[J: small at this moment]
;B[iq];W[do];B[cm];W[cq];B[cr];W[dp];B[dr];W[fq]C[J: what if B B4 now? You're being too aggresive. Also, C16 still has very big moves around]

;B[gp];W[fn];B[fp];W[fl];B[fk];W[em];B[ec]C[J: when the opponent tenukis is a good moment to recap. I think the game is quite even, you have a chance to make your C13 "zone" quite big. Only great are for B to grow is along the upperside, not so big being so open]
;W[ed]C[J: I'd go for something calmer, such as E15];B[dc];W[dd]
;B[gl];W[fm];B[gk]C[J: your left zone is looking worse now, this 3 B stones are quite powerful and difficult to attack]
;W[dh]C[J: good, solid, maybe just a bit too shy, E12?];B[fd]
;W[fe];B[gd];W[ge];B[he];W[cc]C[J: I like this one, but maybe a tad early, G12 protects you and aims at the center]

Lucissc2: i feel like the early game went alright for me

J: quite, yes, but it looks as if B is aiming at making a huge center, a B move around O14 would be very painful]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[dg];B[fi]C[J: time to break in the center!!]
;W[pi]C[J: too ambitious? What about P13 or O14?];B[qi]C[

-- chat --
Lucissc2: i tried to reduce his influence to the center

J: the idea is ok, and as B replied low, may work out, see my prev. comment though]
;W[pj];B[qj]
(;W[og]C[J: great idea... but maybe Q12 is safer? Anyway, the position of Q11 is dangerous, I'd rather Q12 instead of Q10]

Lucissc2: i try to connect somehow to the top left

J: very difficult.. maybe try to tenuki here, the game relies in this fight I'd say]

Lucissc2: now i try to get 2 eyes

J: good];B[mg];W[ng];B[nj];W[ok];B[oi];W[oh]C[J: better first O11, then connect (when he connects), this way you get a better outer wall]
;B[nk];W[mi];B[lk];W[ki];B[gf];W[lf]C[J: great!];B[kg];W[lg]
;B[me];W[le]C[J: nice, same idea as before];B[md];W[mf];B[kh]

;W[mb];B[nb];W[ob];B[ma];W[lb];B[kb];W[me];B[la];W[md];B[jd]
C[J: the idea was ok, the problem is your upper right has suffered from this. The weakest group is L13, I think you should have centered your attack there]

Lucissc2: which i manage to do after quite some time...
Lucissc2: how can i handle this better?
Lucissc2: how do i reduce his influence to the center more efficient?
Lucissc2: how can i make 2 eyes more easily if i get cut?
Lucissc2: i also forgot to secure my top left corner which will loose me the game later on

You did great in the fight, I think. The priority is avoiding to have to do this, that is, having a weak group surrounded by not-so-weak opponent stones. Also, stopping a reduction is very difficult, so I think you should have been more cautious with your reduction (Q11 etc), just aiming at the middle from a *solid* base, always connected to your safe corner, you can reduce a *lot* of territory this way.]

;W[ql];B[rl];W[qo];B[fh];W[nm]C[J: yes, this is a common problem, one get's caught in the rhythm.. and forgets the biggest moves. You're ahead, though, by quite a bit]

Lucissc2: my group is dead and i loose the game

J: yep.

However, I think you did quite great. Seems as if you got a bit angry after B's aggresive start and misplayed a bit in the fuseki, but you had the game in your hands most of the time. 

It is very difficult to know when to come back to defend

Apart of course from making problems and playing, my only advice would be to try to look to the bigger picture from time to time, every few moves or when there is no very urgent move to make. It's the moment you have to ask yourself where the *biggest* move is?
