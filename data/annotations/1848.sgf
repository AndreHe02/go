C[Dear reviewer.

I play black.
My English is bad. Use English simple.
I work the fuseki. In this part I did not know which move to make.
Can you tell me the most critical move in the 50 first.

Thank you.

Frank: I'm not a specialist in big moyo fuseki, but I think I can show you two point where you made strategic mistakes, at move 29 and 61. See my comments.]

;B[pl];W[fq];B[cj];W[cg];B[cm];W[fm]LB[co:a]C[Frank: Up till now nothing wrong, but white 16 seems a little vague. I would prefer to close the corner at C5 (a) to keep the pressure on black.]
;B[mk]C[Frank: Good, playing on the border of two moyos.];W[nk]
C[Frank: Bad, only makes black stronger.];B[nj];W[ok];B[oj]
;W[ml];B[lk];W[ll];B[kk];W[kl];B[pk]C[Frank: Too small. White can easily afford to abandon his two stones and take a big point somewhere else. If white pushes trough, he will have a shortage of liberties himself.]
;W[nl]
(;B[hl]C[Frank: I think this is a big mistake.  Black and white are both building a moyo, but since black's moyo is bigger than that of white, he should just continue pushing. The variation shows a possible continuation.]
;W[jk]C[Frank: This move is perfect for white. It reduces the black moyo + separates black 30]

(;B[hn]C[Frank: Consistent, but allowing white 32 is very, very big.. Black loses more than he destroys himself.
See variation.];W[jj]
(;B[fd]C[Frank: Big, but the two black invasion stones need attention first.]
;W[fk];B[hj]C[Frank Trying to save these two stones now, leads to the destruction of the upper black moyo.]
;W[fi];B[hh];W[jh];B[bo]C[Frank: Necessary];W[bq]
(;B[qe]LB[il:a]C[Frank: Now would be the good time to play at a (J8) to protect against the white cut you suffer from later.]
;W[if];B[gg];W[ke];B[kd];W[ld];B[lc]C[Frank: Cutting at M 15 is possible here, I think.]

(;W[mj]C[Frank: Better continue chasing the black string of stones in the middle.

(;W[il]LB[mi:a][ec:b][bh:c]C[Frank: A big upset for black, of course, but not everything is lost yet.

At a moment like this, you should count the game.  According to my rough estimation, black is +/- 15 points ahead (including capturing H6 and H8), but there are some big points to be played, so the game is not decided yet.

Defending the right lower corner for example, as in the variation, is worth (in gote) 14 points. And there are other big point as a (N11), b (E17) and c (B11), reverse sente).

Therefore black should not try to save his two stones, which only increases the loss in the centre and weakens the black group on the left.]
