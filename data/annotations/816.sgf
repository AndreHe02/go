;B[qp];W[qq];B[qj];W[lp]C[until now the game looks quite normal]
;B[jp]LB[oc:A][od:B][jc:C]C[this stone is the first one, which is really wrong. White has a stong group in the lower left corner. As white is so strong there, black cannot expect to get area there. A better move would be at A or B to prevent the corner encloser (shimari). Another big point is at C, so black can build a larger box (moyo) at the upper side.]
;W[cn];B[oc]C[Seems ok];W[pc]LB[od:A]C[Now black must play at A, as this point is too good for white. the two variants show 2 posible following of the move at A. both are good for black.]

(;B[md];W[od]C[now white gets this good point in sente];B[nc]
;W[ic]C[and white can easily invade blacks position at the upper side]
;B[kc];W[fc];B[id]LB[qg:A][ch:B][fp:C]C[Here black just strenthens the white position without getting profit. Better points are A, B or C]
;W[hd];B[jc];W[ie];B[jd];W[hc];B[qg]C[good move];W[qf];B[pf]
LB[pg:A][rg:B]C[This still leaves a cut at A. Black shoud better play at A himself or play B.]
;W[rf];B[rg];W[pe]LB[of:A][ch:B]C[black should now play elsewhere (tenuki) as the best white can get is the Atari at A. A large move for both sides is orund B.]
;B[of];W[cg]C[and now white gets it and black has to do something for his upper left corner]
;B[co]LB[dn:A][cl:B][cq:C][cp:D][be:E]C[This move is not good. White just plays at A and gets a strong position at the left side. Then the invation at B does not work for black anymore. And the corner is still open to invate for white (for example at C). If black playes something in that area, he should play D to enclose the corner. A move at E is also not bad as it strenthens the upper left corner.]
;W[dn];B[eo]LB[fp:A]C[This is also a bad move for black. It does neither attack someting nor take territory as white can still invade. A stone at A would at least take territory.]
;W[gp]LB[jp:A]C[consequential response. Now the black stone at A is under preasure.]
;B[hq]C[Here black helps to get cut into two peaces at the lower side]
;W[gq];B[hr];W[do]LB[ep:A]C[White plays inconsequently here. At first he creates a weak group at G4 and now he leaves it alone. If Black simply connects at A the white group would be strongly attacked.]
;B[cp]LB[ep:A]C[This protects the wrong cut, as w can now cut at A.]
;W[hp]C[but he does not];B[lq]LB[eq:A]C[Black shoud not defend but attack here. A stone at a would protect the cut and thread to connect at G2. If White plays G2 b can jump to K6 to keep preasure to the G4 group.]
;W[mq];B[lr];W[mr];B[kp];W[gr];B[ip]LB[ep:A]C[Now black simply lives here with a few point in gote and white still has the opppotunity to  cut at A]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[en]LB[fo:A]C[This Atari does now help white in any way. It just wastes one Ko Thread and mayby it would later be better to give atari from A.]
;B[fo];W[in];B[kn];W[lo]LB[jn:A]C[Here Bl;ack must play at A to prevent getting cut.]
;B[ln];W[ko];B[jo];W[jn]C[Now white cuts in sente.];B[jr];W[mn]
;B[kl];W[jl];B[mm];W[nn];B[nm];W[on];B[om]LB[jk:A]C[The sence of the black stones is to attack the white group. The moves at O7 and P7 do not do this. A stone at A would be much better.]

;W[hl];B[fk];W[kk];B[ll];W[hk];B[ii];W[el];B[fl]LB[hi:A]C[White A would be much better. looks at the variants]

(;W[hj];B[hi]LB[ji:A]C[Again a stone at A would be much better. Black gets a large area at the left side and does not have any cutting points]
;W[ij]LB[gi:A]C[Here white should better play at A, as this at the moment just costs liberties and destroys posibilities (aji keshi)]
;B[jj];W[ji];B[kj];W[ki];B[lj];W[jg]LB[gi:A]C[A move at A would be much better as it keeps H11 group under preasure and F5 group as well]
;B[gi]C[Now white is in trouble];W[gj]C[he has to push black in a direction where he can either catch H9 group or some stones at the left]
;B[ek];W[fj];B[ej];W[fi];B[cl]C[and black strikes back];W[bl]
;B[bk];W[dl];B[ck];W[dk]C[wrong, black can simply cut];B[dj]
;W[bj];B[em]LB[ak:A]C[Now A would be the last chance for white not to loose anything]
;W[cm];B[dm];W[bo]C[Too late for resistance.];B[bp];W[be];B[bc]
;W[cd]LB[eb:A]C[Now Black gets the trouble for staying away there so many times. Best move to live here is A (see variant)]

(;B[bd]LB[eb:A];W[ce];B[dd]C[This does not help to get eyes]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[ad];B[ab];W[eb];B[ac]LB[ba:A]C[Now white A and black's group is dead.]
;W[db];B[ba];W[df];B[he]C[Black cannot hope to catch the white stones around K13 as he has a very weak group at H11, which can simply be caught, so white is connected.]
;W[hf];B[ge];W[if];B[gf]LB[mh:A][lh:B]C[black adds more and more prisoners. He should better keep his own territory at A or B]
;W[gg];B[fg];W[gh];B[fh];W[ih];B[ef];W[ee]LB[dh:A]C[Now black has a chanceto play at A (see variant)]

(;B[ed];W[fd];B[fe];W[dh];B[ci];W[bi]LB[bh:A][mh:B]C[playing at A would be a nice tesuji here (see variant), allthough B is still larger.]

(;B[di];W[ch];B[li];W[lh];B[kh]LB[mh:A]C[Black should simply play at a and thread the double Atari at O]
;W[jh];B[kg]LB[mh:A]C[Last chance to play at A.];W[sg];B[sh]

;W[fs];B[hs];W[ds];B[cs];W[cr]C[white should not start such a Ko before looking at his Ko threads]
;B[es];W[fr];B[ds];W[bs];B[am];W[sm];B[sl];W[sn];B[ar]C[The white stones are dead allready. The rest is simple end game.
I think, both players would get better, if they sometimes would give away some stones if there is a larger move at the board. And both should kkep an eye on their own weak groups.]
