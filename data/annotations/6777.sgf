AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hi,

first of all thx for your review already.
I am white here and i am an 10k on KGS this was my first DGS-game so my first game with lots of time to think about moves, so i thought it might be a good game to learn from.

My Opponent is a real live friend of mine who just started playing, however i gave him a few lessons and a link to senseis :)
I guess he copied all josekis from senseis but thats okay.

Since i felt i was a lot better then him i gave him 6 stones but lost in the end by making 2 very dumb mistakes, however i got pretty close to his score and maybe could have won in jose since he doesnt realy understand the meaning of sente and such elementary things.

I tried to play my best game possible although i am not playing a lot handygames as white.

Thx again and have fun with my game

Rules: Komi: 0.5,   Handicap: 6,   Rated game: No
Time limit: Japanese byoyomi: 1 day per move and 15 extra periods

The 1 Day per Move rule was set so we could sleep at night ^^ we usualy took 2-20mins per move


DT (Daniel Tomé) - Hi. I hope you will learn something from this review and improve your Go.
I find handicap games really interesting, and to recreate *pro* handicap games is one of the best ways to improve, belive me. One famouse pro player that played many handicap games was Kitani Minoru. You may want to look at some of his games :)
Please, if you have any questions just e-mail me (danielfacto@gmail.com). Enjoy the review! ^__^]
PL[W]
(;W[jc]C[DT - Good. There are several ways to play as White in 6 stones handicap games. See possible variations.]
;B[hc];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb]C[DT - White does't need to complete the joseki. It is better to play move 5 elsewhere, leaving the situation on the top as it is.]
;B[qc];W[ld]C[DT - This joseki ends is gote for White. Now Black has sente and will take a big point.]

(;B[ne]C[DT - Strange. O15 is not urgent or needed at this point. Black should take a big point instead, around K4.]
;W[jp];B[hq];W[np]C[DT - You're now playing high. Pherhaps the 3rd line would be better. This high approach to the corner is only used under special conditions (after the joseki, White O4, Black Q6, White Q3, Black R3, White P3, Black R2, you can see that Black's territory on the corner is really big, and Black has a monkey jump at O1 that can be used later), so my advice to you is *do not* use this joseki, unless the game you're playing is a competition of moyos ^__^]

(;B[nq];W[mq];B[oq]
(;W[mo];B[pn];W[nm]C[DT - You did not need to play this move. You have to be more active. After this, if Black playes something like Q8, his right side will be huge.]
;B[ol];W[cn];B[fp];W[bp];B[cq]
(;W[ck]C[DT - This is bad. If you want to extend, C8 instead of C9 is the only move.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[dk];W[ci];B[cj];W[bj];B[cg];W[bi]C[DT - It's painful, having to go back and connect with B11. White would like to prevent Black enclosing the corner with D17, for example.]
;B[dn]
(;W[hl]C[i wanted to denie him the territory he could get with his wall

DT - Note also that Black has *almost* all four corners. Its urgent to play something like D17 to avoid Black getting a huge corner. If you can do that and at the same time gain influence towards the center, it would be great. See variation.]
;B[il];W[im];B[hm];W[hk];B[gm];W[jm];B[ik];W[ij];B[jl]
(;W[oh]C[DT - This is a dangerous plan. I think you missed the net. See variation.]
;B[ph]C[he didnt know about ladder breakers ^^

DT - And you don't know nets =p];W[kl]C[DT - Now the ladder works, but P12 was damaging. Black's right side is huge. The P12 - Q12 exchange was good for Black. There is no need to play ladder when you have a net.]
;B[nh]
(;W[ni]C[DT - I would capture immediately.];B[oi];W[mh];B[og]
;W[nj];B[nl];W[ml];B[nn];W[mn];B[om];W[nk];B[mm];W[lm];B[nm]

(;W[bq]C[DT - This is slow. White should invade at san san (top left), and look for sente. See variation.]
;B[mk];W[ll];B[co];W[bn];B[gh];W[cc]C[i think i messed up this invastion later, but it still looks like a good idea to me

DT - Yes, of course it's a good idea to invade. This is a big point.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce]
(;W[be];B[bf]
(;W[db]C[DT - I don't know this variation, but seems OK to me.]
;B[eb]
(;W[cb]C[DT - Is this a joseki? C18 seems wrong, first you should play D15. See variations.]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[ae];W[ec]C[DT - Now White wants a stone at D15. That is why it was so important to play D15 before C18.]
;B[ed];W[fc]
(;B[fd]C[DT - This is of course wrong. Black should punish White's mistake.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[gb];B[hb];W[ea]C[DT - White was really lucky here.]
;B[ie]
(;W[ig]C[DT - With B3 played, you can take the corner now. See variation.]
;B[ih];W[jh];B[hh];W[ji];B[hj];W[gj];B[hi];W[gk];B[fj];W[dh]
;B[di];W[ch];B[dg];W[eh];B[eg];W[ok];B[pk];W[ir]C[DT - Nice point.]
;B[oj];W[mj];B[hr];W[iq];B[ip];W[io];B[hp]C[DT - There is some aji in White's position. Black can play K3 later.]
;W[if];B[le];W[gf];B[gg];W[he];B[hd];W[je];B[id];W[ff];B[fg]
;W[hf]C[DT -  O__o?];B[ef]C[DT - Black is playing slow. There are now some big moves on board for White, such as C2, N2, R18, etc.]
;W[hn];B[gn];W[fl];B[fm];W[em];B[dm];W[el];B[ho];W[in];B[fk]

(;W[en]C[a big blunder.. didnt see it.. maybe lost my chances here

DT - Yes, this was a big mistake.];B[gl];W[jk];B[fo];W[cr];B[dr]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eo]C[hoped for a mistake here ^^

DT - With the 1 Day per Move rule, your hopes are destroyed ^__^]

;B[od];W[rc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[sb];B[sd];W[ra]C[DT - Good for White.]
;B[ga];W[fb];B[ke];W[kd];B[jf];W[kf];B[jd];W[kg];B[je]
(;W[ib]C[the 2nd big blunder.. i surrendered

DT - This is too big. I can't even watch!];B[jg];C[Result: B+Resign

DT - How to improve? Good question. You're doing the right thing. Having your games commented by a stronger player is a good way to improve. Also you should play many fast (and I repeat, *fast*) games. In my opinion, you should only play one slow game every week. If you play many blitz (fast) games you will read faster, witch is of the most importance.
Solve 5 easy life and death problems a day and you will get really strong at fighting.
Apply what you learn from stronger players/books/lectures on your games.
Recreate pro games in your goban in a light way (3 sec per move).
Recreat 9X9 pro games ----> I know it looks ridiculous, but trust me, you will learn good shapes and ways of killing corner groups in a fun way.
Read go proverbs.
If you start doing this, I belive you will get much better at Go. Please, if you have any comments/questions about this list of *how to improve*, e-mail me - danielfacto@gmail.com. 

I hope you will find my comments useful.
