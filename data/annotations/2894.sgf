C[This was a game I played recently on IGS.  I was white and ended up winning by 16.5 (Komi was 0.5).

I guess my main problem in this game was my joseki, I think I messed up a bit there in the beginning, didn't really know how to respond to some of his moves.  Also, as with most beginners I tend to cluster in my play and not spread out soon enough.  If you can offer any advice on these two subjects or if you see anything else I'm doing wrong then please comment.  Also, I'm sure you get asked this alot, but I would like your opinion as to what you think my rank should be.  I'm not too sure about it right now.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[dc];B[pj];W[qc]C[This move is too early in the game. By defending the corner, black will be able to create a big wall and make territoiry on the right side. White will only have a few points in this corner (really not a lot compared to what black can win with a good wall).]
;B[pc]C[Here, black should have playedQ16 instead, in order to build the wall and use the influence of the stone in Q10 to build territory.]
;W[qd];B[qb];W[rg]TR[pe]C[Was this the correct way to respond to R18?  If not, what would have been better?

Q15 seems more efficient.];B[qe];W[re];B[rc];W[rd];B[rb]
(;W[sc]TR[qf]C[T17 is a wast of move. This stone have no meaning.

The shape of white after R14 is good for expansion.
See variation.];B[sb];W[qf];B[pe];W[qh]C[R12 will make black stronger. An extension to the center is better. It is better to circle Q10 later (if it is still possible) that to give to black another good wall.]

See variation.];B[ph];W[pg];B[oh];W[og];B[oi]
(;W[of]TR[nc]C[P14 is a too slow expension. Don't be afraid to extend faster and been cut : your group is already alive, and the other part can run and  find 2 eyes if needed (the game is still at the beginning, black don't have influence everywhere, so you may be able to do it easily).

For example, white in O17 was better.];B[nd];W[ob];B[pb];W[mc]
;B[nb];W[nc];B[oc];W[mb];B[oa];W[jc]C[Good, but black played too passively by eating P19.
Here, you see that P14 is really useless.];B[md];W[lc];B[pm]
C[Any way to attack that territory on the side?

Now it is a little too late. The best you can do is try to invade in the corner and make a little wall if black protect the integrity of his territory. It is important to do it now because in this part of the goban, black is really strong and can extend easily on the bottom part if white don't come immediatly, and make a HUGE corner.]

(;W[oq];B[pq]C[What would have been a better response to this?]
;W[op]C[I think that P4 is good, even if the group is a little alone (Imagine if the next black move is M3 ... white will have to escape, and will have hard time because of the black influence on the right  - black will use this escape to make a pressure on the group and make territory on the bottom part).]
;B[pr];W[or];B[mf];W[oe];B[od];W[ld]C[M16 is not big enough. the white group in P3 really need help with an extension in M4, L4 or L3.]
;B[le];W[ne]C[This move is not good. It is not sente. Black can choose to play elsewhere (tenuki), and connect those 2 stones to another group just after with a stone in M13 for example.

See variation !]
(;B[me];W[ke];B[kf]C[Black don't have to play L15.
He just don't need ..];W[je];B[kg]C[the same for this move.]
;W[lg]C[M13 is useless (cutting water).

Black don't need to play M14, see variation.]
(;B[lf];W[lh];B[pp];W[lq]C[Should I have jumped out farther on this,  or was there something else I should have done?

L3 is also possible, but M3 is stronger if black attack.];B[ce]

(;W[ed]C[Should I have played B16 here instead of the other way since the middle was fairly safe?

E16 is good enough : black need to extend ro save C15, and your territory on the top is safe until the next move.]
;B[dh];W[dj]C[I probably should have played c10 here instead...


Yes !
Now black can play C10.];B[cj];W[ej]C[This is not the good way to play ... black can now play C19 and continue to have terroty, and your 2 stones are alone in the middle of nothing, but near a big black group.]

H3 aim to make points. Since everything is alive and really secure in black's groups around, there is no possibility to play offensive moves and make a big group like this, so H3 seems good.]

If you really want to save the 2 stones, you can connect them on the other side with A or B (B is better since it open a way in the place where black can potencially make points).]
