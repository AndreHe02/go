C[Hi Donald,

This is an odd game, and I'm not sure how useful my review will be... but I'll do my best :-)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[qk]C[A simple approach (at Q5) is a little more common]
;B[qo];W[jp]C[I dislike this move, i think you should have extended with R9 first.  Had you played R9 at R10 then tenuki would be more normal since you would have miai of a 2 space extension to R7 and R13.  As it is, black can gently close the upper side with say R13, and white is left without a base.

Also, why not L3 to make miai of O3 and H3?];B[fo];W[np]C[I think D6 is bigger than O4.  Also, given that black already has a strong base with Q3, I would not be looking forward to black sliding to O2.  You seem to be getting central influence much too early in the game - when it can be easily neutralised.]
;B[dn];W[cn];B[cm];W[co];B[dm];W[dr];B[cf];W[gl]C[Again, you are getting central influence at just move 18.  As black I would respond by letting you take influence and collecting points.  I don't think you can make effective use of central influence gained this early in the game.  

Put it this way:   G8 is on the 8th line, so it is either lightly reducing black's moyo (where?) or else building a grand moyo for you (maybe, if you already had say H5).]
;B[di];W[dj];B[cj];W[dk]C[This is consistent with your plan to get central influence, but I think you are well behind in the game already.  Black is now able to settle C7 by simply playing C9.  That makes C14 connected to safety too.  Further, Q3 is well settled already, so just 23 moves into the game, all of black's groups are strong and black is an excellent position to launch a full-scale attack.]
;B[ck];W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[ch];W[ei];B[fc]C[I would have connected at C11 myself.  As white now, I would capture C11 - it is sente.]

(;W[fd];B[gd]
(;W[ed]C[E16 is an odd choice of joseki.  Do you want to save the corner?  If so then play E17, if not then play F15.  Given black already has C14 -> C17 to elimiate the corner, I would choose F15 myself.]
;B[hc]C[As black, I would have played H17 at G15 and sacrificed F17 - especially with C14 able to slide to B16 or C17]
;W[lc];B[jc]C[This is black's first real mistake, attacking M17 from the wrong direction]
;W[pb]C[I would have played Q18 at Q17 myself.];B[oc]C[P17 probably better at O17]
;W[ob]C[Instead of P18, it is often better to change direction with say R16.  That way you can activate M17 later.]
;B[nc]C[O17 better at O18];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb];B[ld]C[Black has made the same mistake you did - build a central wall at a point it is trivial to reduce it]

(;W[kc]C[L17 is poor technique.  You can also consider L16 and sacrifice for aji]
;B[kd];W[jd]C[Bad overplay, and ajikeshi];B[jb];W[lb];B[je]
;W[ge]
(;B[id]C[I would prefer J16 at H15]
(;W[pf]C[Good idea, but maybe a little close.];B[ph]C[This is the concern.   If Q14 was at Q13, then black could not invade like this]
;W[qh];B[qi];W[qg];B[pi];W[mf]C[N14 indicates sabaki, you are willing to sacrifice Q14

Even if this goes well for you, you are going to hurt R9 badly which is problematic to winning the game]
;B[of];W[oe];B[og];W[pe];B[ne]
(;W[od]C[Mistake];B[pc];W[rc]C[You're in trouble now, Q15 no longer has enough room to live.

S17 at S16 gives life for Q15, but kills the corner];B[rd]
(;W[qc];B[qd];W[nf];B[me]C[Unless you pull a miracle, the game is over]
;W[ok];B[mi];W[lk];B[lf]C[Game over

What do I mean by that?  At this point, black's upper group is 100% safe, black's left group is 100% safe, black's lower right group is 100% safe, so in the remainder of the game, black will gain more points than you since black can attack your groups and you can't attack black's.  If you look at the current balance of scores, you have some points in the upper right, some in the lower left, (virtually) none in the upper left, and a weak framework that's bound to be worth something in the centre.  Black on the other hand has some points in the lower right, some on the left, and about 40 for the UR central group.

That is to say, black has more points than you, and is likely to get more of the disputed points over the remainder of the game.  Black can play a solid, boring yose and still win while you will have to be extremely creative to have a chance.]
;W[hq];B[gn];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr];W[on];B[ms]C[N1 is too early.  J6 or similar is bigger]
;W[lr];B[in];W[rk];B[ri]C[Having sacrificed the aji of Q15 with S9, you should now play the double-sente T16 move]
;W[ig];B[kn];W[hn]C[This is a mistake, it hurts your right side more than it helps the upper side]
;B[ho];W[hm];B[jo];W[hp]C[H4 is very small, F2 is bigger];B[gp]
;W[mr];B[ns];W[lh];B[mh];W[lg];B[mg];W[kf];B[le];W[kj]C[Good sequence, black needs to play a move like H14, and K8 now to reduce the upper left moyo.]
;B[rm]C[Small mistake, K8 is bgger.];W[hf]C[Good, though I think K8 is bigger]
;B[bd];W[bc]C[Mistake, black just sacrifices the connection to C14 and lives in the corner.  Only play B17 when C14 is short on eyespace

I would play K8 instead];B[cd];W[cc];B[eb];W[db]C[Black is happy reducing in sente]
;B[jl];W[jm]C[Good];B[im];W[il];B[kl];W[jk];B[ll];W[qm];B[rn]
;W[lp];B[gr];W[hr];B[hs];W[is];B[gs];W[ls];B[or];W[nr];B[os]
;W[dl];B[cl]C[Mistake, should be B7];W[em];B[en];W[fm];B[ik]
;W[hl];B[jj]C[Mistake, ajikeshi.  Better to just play N9 directly]
;W[kk];B[ki];W[li];B[mk];W[lj];B[mj];W[kg];B[rb];W[qb];B[sc]
C[damocles [12k?\]: hm - thought i read that before ...];W[la]
C[Mistake, should be R19];B[qa];W[ra];B[sb]C[Okay, overall I think you lost the game because you concentrated too much on influence where your opponent collected cash.

Also, the mistakes (missing Q17, missing R19, etc) cost a bit too much - especially when they were few and far between by your opponent.  I've been quite terse with my comments because I think you need to adjust your basic techhnique/fuseki rather than concentrate on anything tricky.  I think you got a few points behind in the fuseki, a few more in the early chuban, and the game was pretty much sealed by the mid chuban so that black was able to cruise to a comfortable 10 or so point win.

On the positive side, you did manage to convert your central influence into cash, which is quite impressive given how early you obtained the influence.  Also, against an opponent that made few mistakes you managed to stay not far behind for the whole game.  Finally, with the exception of the careless M19 at the end, you managed to keep all your groups alive, always a handy thing :)]
