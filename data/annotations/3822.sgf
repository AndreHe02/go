C[Hello!
This is my second game with ToRa. The problem is - I cannot find where I did wrong. This guy is so expansive playing with me...

Please comment any of my mistakes, not only the moves I ask for comments.

After reviewing the complete game, I've come to a conclusion.  Your play seems to create weak groups without settling them.  Try not to create any weak group in the first place.  If you must, such as in situations where you are behind and you don't want to spend a move to defend it, then come back to defend your weak group once you believe you've caught up.  In any case, try not to create two or more weak groups at the same time.  A skilled opponent can take advanage of this situation and win the game easily.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd]C[I usually play san-ren-sei when playing black.]
;W[jo]LB[nq:A]C[Isn't this too high?

Yes.  This makes it easier for black to approach the corner at A.  Please see variation..]

(;B[jq]C[How should I reply this? I was afraid of W K3, creating influences on both sides. That's why I played in K3. But now I think W purposely invited me... The whole game since this moment was making pressure on weak black groups

No need to rush into white's area.  Black plays first and will always get a bigger framewwork than white, especially with the san-ren-sei opening.  White has to come in black's framework first.  Please see variation.]
;W[hq];B[mq];W[oq];B[ip]LB[pl:D][mm:C][pn:B][mo:A]TR[jo]C[Usual move is to jump out at A.  White has to jump at B or else black can seal white in.  After black's jump C, if white defends at D then black takes sente.  Otherwise black can seal white in at D. 

Attack the marked stone later.  Settle your group first.];W[gp]
;B[io];W[jn];B[in];W[jm];B[im]C[I do not know if the whole crawling sequence was good for B]
;W[mo]C[With this sequence, white gets profit on the lower left and some thickness on the right.  Black gets nothing but a weak group.]
;B[jl]LB[il:A]C[I wanted to take some inittative with this move, but I failed

White is strong here.  Simply extend at A.];W[il];B[kl];W[kp]
;B[kq];W[ik];B[ln];W[lo];B[np]C[This only helps white.];W[mn]
;B[ml];W[oo];B[nr];W[om];B[qm]LB[li:A]C[Preparing invasion in the corner. Unfortunatelly this created two targets W could attack.

This is unreasonable.  Your bottom group isn't completely safe.  You also have a very weak group at the center, and now you are creating a third weak group by invading.

Keypoint:  always settle your weak groups before invading.  This is early in the game.  No need to try risky strategy.  Play A to form good shape and put indirect pressure against the two center white stones.]
;W[ok];B[qj];W[qh];B[pk];W[oj];B[lj];W[lh];B[jj];W[hi];B[kh]
LB[jh:A][ki:B]C[A is lighter.  No big deal if white peeps at B.  The game move helps white to build thickness.]
;W[kg];B[jh];W[lg];B[rp]LB[hg:C][ig:B][jg:A]C[Black still needs to crawl out at A, or else a move by white at B or C would be very severe.]
;W[nd]C[Again white is making pressure and tries to split B]
;B[qe]LB[qf:A][rh:B]C[A is better with the aim to link under at B.]
;W[ph];B[pc]LB[pb:B][qf:A]TR[qe]C[Now you can see the marked stone at A would be a better position.  For the game move, it is too slow.  B is better.]
;W[fd];B[de]LB[jf:B][jg:A]TR[fd][jd]C[This was a click mistake. Planned D14

Black's center group and the marked black stone are not connected.  It's imperative to play A. If white insists on cutting at B, the subsequent fight would help black to build some thickness to attack the marked white stone.  Although D14 is a normal reply, A is more urgent.]
;W[if];B[gc];W[fc];B[ig]LB[hh:A]C[A is better, although black is still in great danger.]
;W[hg];B[hh];W[gh];B[ih];W[gf];B[ij];W[hj];B[mj];W[ni];B[li]
;W[gk];B[ii]C[How to secure upper side?];W[ld]LB[lc:A]C[White is too soft.  A play at A and black will have a hard time living.]
;B[kc];W[mc];B[gb];W[fb];B[ib];W[cg];B[db];W[ef]LB[dm:B][fm:A]
[cq:C]C[How to deal with left side moyo?

It is very difficult since black's bottom group isn't complete safe.  You can't invade unless all the surrounding groups are settled.  I will try a shallow invasion move around A, enticing white to respond at B.  Then enter the 3-3 point at C immediately.]
