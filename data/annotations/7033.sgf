C[W played by 4d
B played by 7k

I am looking for some input on B's play

-----------------------

Hello!

My name is Kalle, and my comments start with "Kalle: ". You already have a lot of comments, so I will take them as a starting point and give my own opinions. There are also some things that are not mentioned yet, so I will take them up in my comments. I hope you find my advice useful :)]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[jq]
(;B[qj]LB[ce:A]C[probably ok, but seeing as W develops faster, a move like A would probably have been better?

Kalle: I guess you can say that black is a little overconcentrated on the right side. Playing at A for example would be more active. I've been reading about komoku low approach moves lately, so I would definitely play at A myself to see what happens :)]
;W[ci]C[Kalle: Now white has an ideal "Chinese opening" formation on the left side.]
;B[jd];W[qo];B[mq];W[qq];B[qr];W[pp]
(;B[oq];W[rq]LB[ql:A][rr:B]TR[jq]C[Kalle: Now A and B are miai for white, so he is safe. Normally you should play elsewhere now and return later to play here, when you know which one of the two directions (A or B) is more important for you.

But I think that given the existence of the marked white stone, it might be a good idea to stabilize your group immediately so that white no longer has any forcing moves against your group. Strengthening your group also makes it easier for you to try an invasion in the white formation on the lower side.]

(;B[rr]LB[oj:B][ql:A]TR[qj]C[this was probably not needed

Kalle: This is a very solid move that stabilizes your group and takes away white's eye potential in the corner. It is difficult to say how necessary this move really is, but it is a good point on the board and I can't criticize you for playing it. The only problem is that white can immediately get a stable position by playing at A. This in turn weakens your marked stone, but it's not a very bad result in the end, because you get the good point at B next.

Be that as it may, settling white's shape now is not desirable, and if the move here is unnecessary, it is a bad move (Check out "The Direction of Play" by Takeo Kajiwara, page 45 :).]
;W[ql];B[oj];W[oe]LB[md:A][pf:B]C[Kalle: I think the standard moves here are A and B. I would choose B. (see variation)]

(;B[qg]C[first big mistake];W[qe]LB[pd:A]TR[qg]C[Kalle: You could consider playing at A and attacking white on a large scale. Because of the marked stone, your position is strong. (see variation)]

(;B[re];W[pd];B[qc];W[pc]LB[pb:B][qf:A]TR[oc]C[Kalle: Black shouldn't give up the connection with the marked stone. I would play at B.]

(;B[qf];W[qb];B[pe];W[od]
(;B[of]C[overplay on B's part];W[ld]TR[mb][nb][ob][pb][mc][nc]
[oc]C[my overplay cost a lot

Kalle: Yes, now the white group is comfortable and your stone on the upper side is a little lonely.]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[lb];W[mb]
(;B[jb];W[ob];B[gc];W[ce];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[dh]
LB[bq:B][iq:A]TR[ed][fe][ff][fg][eh]C[i was worried about W getting too much on top here

Kalle: Maybe you should now try to do something on the lower side, you have pretty strong groups on both sides of the white formation there. You could for example try the tsuke at A. The point B is also becoming quite big now, and getting to play there would have saved you from a lot of trouble later :)]

(;B[ff]LB[bj:A]C[Kalle: This move limits white, but he didn't have that much potential here anyway, so it's not that big. There's also the problem that this move doesn't have a really good follow-up, so white can ignore it. But now black A is a real threat, so you might more probably get it in sente. It's a pity that you didn't get to play it in the game, I would say that it was your priviledge.]
;W[jo]TR[eo][fo][go][ho][io][jp][jr][js]C[and not at the bottom

Kalle: This adds a lot of strength to the white formation.]
;B[ip]LB[io:B][iq:A]C[so i tried him out, expecting A or B]
;W[jp]C[4D of course played C

i gave up on my stone now

(i have no idea what i did here with the editing)

Kalle: This is the most obvious answer. I think you should play from the above now, as you suggested. See my variations.]

(;B[kr]LB[bq:A]C[too small for B

Kalle: This is actually not very small, but your group here is stronger than your group on the left side, so you should play there instead of this. A is now really the vital point, and you should hurry to get it before white does.]
;W[bq]LB[cg:D][bj:C][bo:A][co:B]TR[ff]C[Kalle: You played A here, but I think that B is better. It gives you more territory and also eye space. But there is something to think about here. Now white has taken a big endgame point, and answering it directly is submissive. In the endgame you should always look for ways to ignore your opponents move and play a bigger move elsewhere. In this case you have the huge endgame move at C to aim for, and it also gives you some eye space, which you desperately need now. After playing at C you still have the chance to come back and connect at B if you want, because for white to play at A now would be gote, and it's not the biggest thing on the board. C is also a good point for you for another reason: it works together with the marked stone, so that you can aim at D etc. later. White's area at the top left might be reduced quite a lot this way.]
;B[bo];W[bj]C[this was a huge move which i missed

Kalle: This move is really big, both territorially and also regarding attack and defense. Now it really is difficult to make two eyes.]

(;B[bl];W[jr]C[Kalle: This is a huge point as well, and it removes white's weaknesses from the bottom side formation. White has the lead now, I would say.]

(;B[nf]LB[fn:A]TR[eb][bj][rk][bq][jr][kr]C[at the time, i thought of this as a very big move

Kalle: This is not big, because white doesn't have any potential in this part of the board. The second line moves are probably the biggest at this stage of the game (marked). Also protecting you left side group while limiting white's actions there is big. You could play at A, after which white could no longer harass your group there.]
;W[rk]LB[eb:A]TR[bj][bq][jr]C[Kalle: White takes already his fourth second line endgame point. You should tenuki now and get the last one at A. These moves are worth almost ten points each, so you must make sure that your opponent doesn't get all of them.]
;B[rj];W[ol];B[no]LB[eb:A]C[Kalle: This is a big point, but I would say that A is bigger.]
;W[eb];B[fd]LB[fb:A]C[Kalle: This move should be at A. If White later makes a monkey jump at the top edge after this move, you will lose all teritory at the edge. In order to have territory in the center, you still need to invest a lot of stones, and it's not efficient enough.]
;W[en]C[Kalle: This move is actually sente, and that's the reason it was so important for you to play here first.]
;B[fb]TR[ck][bl][cn][bo][bp]C[still, i thought that marked group is perfectly alive]
;W[dl];B[an];W[bm]C[badabing!

- the rest is history

Kalle: Yep :)];B[cm];W[ap];B[cj];W[ek];B[bk];W[bi];B[ej];W[fk]
;B[di];W[eh]TR[gg][gh][gi][fj]SQ[gk][hk][jl][jm]C[4d said that i probably would have ran away, but benifit W would get by chasing me would be too much

Kalle: Yes. I think the main reason for your loss in this game was that you didn't get those very big and important endgame moves on the second line, and your opponent managed to steal them all for himself. This was actually the reason for your left side group getting into such a difficult situation. You played solidly in the beginning, not making weak groups, but you didn't defend properly later. When you start to appreciate the value of the endgame moves I've been talking about, your opponents will have a hard time against you.

I wish you all the best in the future!

(;B[bm]LB[fn:A]C[i should have just made life and relax

Kalle: This move makes eye shape, but it's really passive. You should be more optimistic and play at A instead.]
))
(;B[bk]C[if i die - i die, if i live, might as well get that extra point

Kalle: That's one way to think about it, and even if you have to run away, this gives you a lot of liberties, if not two eyes.]
)
(;B[bm]C[safe play

Kalle: Yes. This move is the best one if you want eye shape, and I guess you should play it in this situation. It leaves least weaknesses and your not going to get much territory here anyway.]
))
(;B[fn]LB[gp:A][bq:B]C[i probably should have applied some pressure from the top

Kalle: Yes, you can play from above. This move prevents white from playing in the same area, which he might want to do to expand his framework. This move doesn't add very much to your own position though, so it would be nice to get it in sente.

In this case, the threat of playing at A might be serious, so maybe white wants to answer. But you should calculate the following sequences to know for sure, and that's not easy. Anyway, the point B is worth more than ten points in itself, and stabilizes your group completely, so getting that point is very important. The problem is that if you play B instead of this move, white might get a lot of points in the center.]

(;B[eo];W[ep];B[fn]LB[bq:A]C[or something like this

Kalle: I think this sequence strengthens white way too much, and you don't really gain anything, your shape is not very strong. And white can still get A, which is big.]

(;B[bq]C[Kalle: This is a very solid and big move, and it feels good to play it. The problem here is that your position is pretty low on the left side, and white can use that to build up his framework. (see variation)]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[dn];B[dm];W[em];B[cm];W[el]TR[bq]SQ[ip]C[Kalle: Something like this might happen. White doesn't mind making you stronger on the side, since you already have the triangled stone and are secure. Now your squared stone became a sacrifice without compensation.]

Kalle: This is better for black, but why do you want to make the exchange of the marked stones? I think you can play the kosumi or a keima straight away if you want to. But it seems that the best choice is to save the single stone from getting captured and move it out, like in the next variation. White gets a really uncomfortable position after that.]

Kalle: I agree.];W[hc]LB[of:A]C[Kalle: I think it's pretty risky for white to play from this direction now, because his group in the top right doesn't have eyes. You could now pressurize by playing at A.]
