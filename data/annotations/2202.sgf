;C[I am Chrisleo. I was black in my game.

Reviewer: Hi, my name is Dave Byrne.  I am 4k-6k KGS.  I will be doing your review.  If you have any questions please feel free to email me at dbyrne@stevens-tech.edu.  I would also be interested as to where this game was played and what you and your opponents ranks are?]

;B[qc];W[lc];B[rc]LB[mc:A]C[This move seems questionable to me.  The attachment at A seems better.  There are probably stronger moves than A even.]
;W[nb];B[ob];W[oc];B[od];W[pb]LB[re:A]C[the black stones have lost a good portion of their base now.  However the clamp at A is open, and they can run for the center so they are not in severe danger.]
;B[rg];W[qe];B[qd]C[why here? this is a strong connection already?]

;W[og];B[kd];W[kc];B[jd];W[dj];B[fc]LB[fq:A]C[why this approach?  I can't say its wrong, but the approach at A seems to show emphasize towards the most interesting side.]

;W[fr]LB[ep:2][fq:1][cr:6][dr:4][gr:3][fs:5]TR[jp]C[your response to the double hane was very interesting.  I am not sure whether you should have let white take the corner here or not.  After b1,w2,b3,w4,b5,w6 I am not sure whether the marked stone hinders you, or whether it becomes a nice target after being isolated.  I probably would have played this sequence and tried to attack the marked stone.  I won't say your line of play is wrong though.]

[lp]C[This is an interesting move.  It move reduces and helps out your upperside group.  I would have played somewhere else, but will not complain about this move.  I have a book that says when you trying to reduce a moyo with a move like this you should draw a line between the two outermost stones and that is the line where you can think about playing around.  In this case it is not clear what you count as the "outermost stones"  If you use the marked stones, your move seems to be on the correct line.]
;W[jr];B[lr];W[nh];B[mh];W[ni];B[op];W[ld];B[le];W[ke]C[this is a big cut for white.  You have two groups to take care of now.  However, I think you can capture the cutting stone.  See my variation.]

(;B[kf];W[je];B[ie];W[jf];B[kg]C[again, capturing the cutting stones here is very good for black.  see variation.]

[gb][gc][ed][gd][hd][ee]SQ[jg][jh][jj][jk]C[after the sente exchange of A for B, white has 4 liberties to your 8.]
;W[rp]C[hmmm white seems to get away with to much with this invasion.  why not force him to live outside by playing s3?  I think that is where I would play. S5 seems playable too.]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[qn]C[again instead of crawling out again, s3 seems strong]
;W[qq];B[rn];W[qr];B[pr];W[sr]TR[rg][qh][qi][qj]C[White has taken a well defended corner now.  I see why you are hesitant to push white out, when you are worried about the marked stones, but I still would like to make things harder on white.]

[jh][jj][jk]SQ[gb][gc][ed][gd][hd][ee]C[after this the liberty count after the A -B exchange is 4 to 6.  So you still have nothing to worry about.]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[jk]C[i think a simple block here simplifies things.  see variation.  Although things don't work out poorly your way either.]

C[there is another way to make life here by connecting out.  It would allow you to play tenuki here because it works even after a16.  Although you are way up, so probably best to play it safe and eliminate potential ko threats.]
