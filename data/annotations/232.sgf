DT[1995-11-15]TM[900]KM[5.5];B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd]C[sanrensei is a  favorite
of mine too :)];W[dj]C[Supposedly, the highest priority move is the
enclosure at C/D5, but this is up there too, so can't be
cricticized.];B[pj];W[nc]L[co][do][jq][jp][cf][qc]C[This is rather dangerous. Black wants
white to jump in here where he can attack. The labeled points all seem
better.];B[oc]C[Yes, attack
vigorously.];W[nd];B[pf];W[qc]M[nc][nd]C[Too early. The power  Black
can build containing this invasion is hazardous to the marked stones. After  the
marked stones are safer, this becomes a good
invasion.]
(;B[qd]C[This is a little easy on white. Letting  White
live on the side hurts white's outside group, this let's him get away with his
stones. See variation for a possiblity];W[rd]N[main]C[This doesn't  look
right, but can't say why. P18 what I
expect.];B[re];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb]C[S16
now leaves W short a liberty, so cannot connect S17.];W[qe];B[rc];W[rf]
;B[sd];W[qf];B[pg];W[qh];B[ph];W[qi];B[qj]M[nd][nc][ob][pb]C[Q11 may keep the  wall
more solid. The marked stones are seperated, so still attackable. The wall  will
help in that attack.];W[pe]C[White begines to poke
holes in the black wall.];B[oe];W[pi]C[Now it becomes more
obvious whie R10 might be better at
Q11];B[oi];W[oh];B[oj];W[of]C[Now White will
connect his groups, which Isolates black's corner, and diffuses the power of
the sanren-sei.  Black also will end up with a weak group to care
for.];B[og];W[nf];B[nh]C[This group is strengthened.
However, it seems White is still seperable with P16. But, I like this too. P16
feels slow, and white probably whould have an advantage in such a
fight.];W[od];B[qn];W[qo]C[Not sure this is good, it
strengthens Black, and still leaves the corner
open.];B[pn];W[nq]C[Black can still invade the 3-3. Perhaps now
is not the time, but he can either live on the bottom of the corner, or  connect
to allies at S5.];B[iq];W[kq];B[fq];W[co]C[Somehow
the last few moves seem to help White. Black has induced White to make a good
extension, and a corner enclosure. Perhaps approaching the corner first would
have been a good prelude to jumping into lower
side.];B[jo];W[ko];B[jn];W[mn]C[White seems to  gain
here, but perhaps not to be helped, since B doesn't want a weak
group.];B[nm];W[eo]C[Very strong];B[go];W[gc]C[The
K16 stone is feeling very lonely now.];B[cg]C[E17 seems more common,
but this is a good extension
too.];W[db];B[cc];W[ge];B[me];W[ne];B[jf];W[ld];B[kc];W[ke];B[je];W[mf]

 JamesL 23k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[qq]C[Great.];W[pq];B[qr]C[S5 is more normal,
ensuring the connection.];W[ro];B[qp];W[sq]C[I think
connecting at Q5 is better. Black will have a hard time living back
there.];B[po];W[rn];B[rm];W[rq];B[rp];W[pr];B[sn];W[oo];B[on];W[nn];B[mm]
;W[fp];B[fo]C[Perhaps G4 is better, possible making a double  atari out of
this move
later.];W[en];B[gp];W[fl];B[gl];W[fk];B[gk];W[lj]C[White is ensuring the middle will be worth  little.  If the
center is discounted, W is leading slightly. Sharp endgame play will be
needed.];B[kh];W[ki];B[mi];W[li];B[gh]C[
 windyjr 23k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[lm];B[ll];W[kl]C[Seems a stretch. White is already
into this area, so perhaps this move would be better spent securing his own
area.];B[no];W[op];B[ln]C[Nice setup, punishing White's  L8
well.];W[mo];B[lo];W[mp];B[km];W[lk];B[kp];W[lp];B[jp]C[Black definately gained out of this  sequence,
and is now likely leading a
bit.];W[ji];B[ih];W[jl];B[ed];W[fd]C[

sente.  A couple of sente moves can make up the points quickly, like C19 & R1
worth 3-4 poitns each.];B[fj];W[ek];B[dr]C[Yes, this is a
big spot too I've been watching for. J9 really gave black the opportunity to
collect these big points.];W[er];B[eq]C[

;B[cp];W[bp];B[fr];W[ds];B[gf]C[May not really be
sente. Simple sente moves like J19, M1, Q1, S11 seems
better.];W[he];B[hf];W[rj]C[Now White gets a turn. Had
Black taken these sente points first, he could have denied White such good
points.  Try to find the Double sente endgame points first. That is, the moves
that are sente, for whichever player gets to play there
first.];B[rk];W[si];B[sk];W[qg];B[ng]C[This
is reverse sente, and is worth more than gote, but there are sente points  still
left, as mentioned earlier.];W[ca]C[And so, black lets White now have
other sente points.];B[ba];W[da];B[bb];W[hm];B[gj];W[in];B[ho];W[im]C[White gives up sente again. R1, F1, are  choices
that jump out
simply.];B[id];W[hd];B[ia]C[Good.];W[ha];B[ja];W[gb];B[ls];W[ms];B[ks];W
[mr];B[mc];W[md];B[qs]M[rn][ro][qo]C[I don't see any reason why you can't  play Q1. The
marked stones can be captured if liberties begin to look
tight.];W[ps];B[aj];W[ak];B[ai];W[sf];B[na];W[qa];B[ra];W[pa];B[se]C[
 windyjr 23k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[sj];B[fs];W[ni]C[Perhaps defending against this
earlier would be bigger than the F1 or such moves.];B[mh];W[mg];B[oh]C[With liberites shortened up in this
area, the hole at Q8 area and the weakness of the P/R7 points is brought to
light.];W[ol];B[qk];W[om];B[pl];W[nl];B[lm];W[jm];B[kn];W[pm];B[qm]C[A really  good
sequence for White. These are hard to spot, and burn me too, but when you  begin
to see low-value endgame moves like F1, perhaps take a break to look for such
potential weaknesses.];W[io];B[ip];W[es]C[

early disadvantage.  White seems better after B's jump into bottom, and W's
attack on the upper middle B stone.  But B recovered well, played good
territory moves in UL and LR. White's early turning point was the greed on
lower side that let B in.  Both players didn't take full advantage of the
endgame, but B seemed to better, getting the win.])
(;B[ob]N[Seperate White];W[qe];B[pe];W[rg];B[nf]C[White gets some side area, but the two trapped
stones will have a very hard time.]))
