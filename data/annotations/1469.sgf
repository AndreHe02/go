C[Comments by Dieter 1k (IGS ?) and Eitan (E:) 1d IGS (for GTL).]
;B[pe];W[qp]C[E: The takamoku wants to develop on the right side, for example Q17-O16 joseki creates thicknes facing it, so this stone is good. If Q3, B can play R6 or even Q6 .]
;B[cd];W[dq];B[do];W[ed]C[Immediate response

E: hmm, see next comment];B[df];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[hc]
C[E: now this stone is less effective than it could be if the stone to the right is Q16 or P16
So perhaps consider Q17 instead of E16.];B[cq]
(;W[cr]C[E: hmm, not sure.
When B extends at the left side, he has a good position.
consider variation.];B[cp];W[er];B[ck]LB[cl:a]C[I thought both the UL and LL asked for an extension, so that 17 was a good move, before embarking on the corner joseki.  E: True, C9 is very effective.

But:
B is laying all his eggs in one basket.  E: Game is not over yet, B will get a chance at other areas. Nothing wrong in developing a big area.

Moreover, B17 should be at A.
E: I don't understand this comment.];W[ek]
(;B[dm]LB[fq:a]C[Submissive. Why not attack at A ?

E: let's see in variation ...
Anyway this is not bad. B is very solid.W a little low.];W[jq]
;B[fp]C[Another bad move. B is losing it.

E: The idea seems to ba a leaning attack, but thi s is not a forcing move, W can ignore. the D3 formation has a lot of life in it.
Maybe simply Q17 shimari is quiet development, leaving E9 for later.]
;W[gq]C[E: Now this is truly submissive, or very territorial. B has G4, W H3 and K3 is too close, too low.]
;B[pj]C[E: R10 also possible. B is inviting W to play Q17. However, W has R17 too. To be consistent, B would play R16]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[W didn't expect this one, but it is the only consistent move with 23

E: true, but W gets a soild corner, so this is for special occasions. 2 reasons support this move : a. the Q10 stone b. the H17 stone, lowering the efficincy of a wall to the left that would be the result of B P17. One small reason against : R4 also limits the expansion of B's potential territory, for example R8.]
;W[pc];B[ne];W[od]C[ajikeshi

E: agree.];B[oe];W[mc];B[qn]C[E: consistent. Perhaps R7 though .]
;W[op];B[nm]C[and B takes back the advantage
E: agree, I prefer B at this stage. But the difference is not great.

About O7 - W Q6 B Q7 W R7 not easy to handle.
Explore the possibilities.];W[cj]C[I'd have played a gentle reducing move on the right.

E: W has to be somewhat non-gentle, complicate the game, look for a chance.]
;B[dk];W[dj];B[ej];W[dh];B[fj];W[bk];B[bl];W[bi]LB[fh:a]C[wrong: 40 is kikashi
42 should run out at A and split Black into 2

E: agree about getting out. It is not really splitting though, as B is settled on both sides.
and this move is consistent with W's tight territorial style. The difference between W A8 next and B B10 is not small. So myself, I'd get out, but if one has confidence in his style, and relies on his ability to reduce moyos, this is playable.]
;B[ff];W[al]LB[fh:a]C[Again this move should be at A. W44 turns the overconcentrated B19 into a good move.
E: did you mean D7 ?];B[eh]C[Black is connected. All his stones are working well together

E: True. Just remember - in the end you count points.];W[cl]
C[E: This costs W a move. Should be B7 , threatening D8. If B D8, W is alive and can swith elsewhere.]
;B[dl];W[bm]C[White stabilizes but Black has sente again.];B[jd]
C[Bad move

E: converting large moyos to territory is not simple, and takes stainless nerves, especially when you don't have any rock-solid territory and the opponent has.
If you have or can get "Invincible - the games of Shusaku" by John Power , look at Game Six against Showa. One of the only games where Shusaku goes for a moyo.

Here, B M16 looks better. W N15 now looks effective,];W[he]
C[E: wrong penetration. the fertile area is on the right.];B[if]
;W[hf]C[E: W is helping B to build a huge territory on the right.]
;B[hg]C[without thinking

E: hmm... just extending would be fine.
very important to count the game periodically, so you know what you need to win.
W has some 55 solid points. B has maybe 25 safe points on the right,  some 8 more on the left, probably 10 more around F7 (considering G4), and a lot of potential besides. Conclusions : solidify your position, avoid cuts and fights.]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[ih];B[gh]LB[gg:a][hh:b]C[the shape move; both a and b mad bad shape

E: yes, now that I think of it.];W[ho]LB[gp:a][fl:b][ik:c]C[E: W is aiming at moving out with E9, and also to forestall B G4 kikashi, and provide a safe port for the J12 stones. So this move has several goals, which is an important requirement for a good move. However,  this threat is not severe enough, not close enough to the main fighting area. B J9 would both protect against W F8 and attack the 2 stones severely.]
;B[fl]LB[ik:a]C[too cautious, probably

E: I believe so.];W[gk];B[fk];W[le]C[E: good, important point as before, except now it  starts a fierce fight, whereas before it was just limiting B's moyo expansion.]
;B[lf];W[mf];B[me];W[kf];B[lg];W[kg]
(;B[ld]C[E: consider variation.];W[ke];B[md];W[nc]LB[lh:a][mg:b]
[mh:c][ng:d][je:e][nb:f]C[E: real strange. If B O17, W has O18 and no great harm done. If W atari at M12, then captures the pivotal stones with K15, W has a good lead, almost a won game.]
;B[kd]C[E: Wrong - should J16, either connect or capture H15 stones.]
;W[je]C[E: W gets the vital stones after all.];B[id];W[ie];B[hd]
;W[gd];B[ge];W[gg]C[E: W practically alive. this is not needed.B F16 now severe.]

C[I'm happy to be able to play this move. White should have taken it during the previous exchange

E: true.];W[hh]LB[gf:a]C[There is still a little aji in A, but my group has bad shape, so White is alive.

E: and game quite close. Actually I's take W now. S6 or Q6 to reduce in sente.]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[kp];W[lq]C[E: the connection is not worth getting pressed so low while giving B more thickness in sente]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[lp];W[mq];B[mp];W[nq];B[lm]LB[lj:a][kl:b]C[Probably better at A ?
E: K4, then B in that area.
But S5 bigger.];W[lj]
(;B[ng]C[E: see variation.
If there was an Oscar for cautious plays...];W[oj];B[pk];W[oh]
LB[ml:a][oi:b]C[E: this is making the cautious move looks good.
Better to peep at 'a' , then play 'b'];B[ni]C[E: good.];W[oi]
C[E: W is starting a severe fight when he is leading.];B[nj]
;W[ok];B[nh]LB[om:a];W[nk];B[mk]C[The exchange is bad for white, we agreed in the analysis]
;W[qi];B[rk]C[With this move, I feel confident in the fight.

E: good. you have an interesting eye fr shape. I'm not sure I could find such a move.]
;W[om];B[on]C[E: see variation (conclusion: W can't live)]
(;W[nl];B[nn];W[ml];B[ll];W[lk];B[mj];W[mm];B[mn]C[White played this sequence almost without thinking]
;W[ro];B[rn];W[sd];B[rf]C[too cautious maybe
E: yes];W[sf];B[sg];W[se];B[qg]C[but with 135 all aji has disappeared from the area, and Black can make a positional judgment

C[This ko is worth less than it seems. But Black holds the lead during the endgame and wins with 3.5 points.

E: how less then it seems ? it's over the 6 W stones. B doesn't need to fill the C6 liberty to give atari. see continuation.

A good fighting game. I would emphasize the need to keep a strong hold on the game's status - who is leading and what does it take to win.
It is very important to know what risks to take and when just to play to keep the status-quo.
In this game, this point was clearly seen in B's H13 and W's P12 moves. Count the game continually, until you can do it very quickly.

Looks like you both will get a deal stronger .
