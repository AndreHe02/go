This game got hard after white made a weak group in the top left corner. This gave black many points on the top without black making any weak groups. It was hard then for white to come back.

Hopefully this helped. I had trouble coming up with a good approach to the top left corner. Perhaps it's best to go with go seigen's advice then, and not the d11 shoulder hit that was played. The variation showed from go is from his book "a way to play in the 21st century". I don't own a copy, but I've seen the variation shown a lot. One would assume it's better explained in the book.]
