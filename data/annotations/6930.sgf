C[reviewee: Hi, I am black. Actually I'm a solid EGF 1d (GoR 2094) and was surprised that I did quite well against a kgs 4d.
The fuseki and middle game went quite well for me. A kibitzer said black lost 15-20pts in the end game which is probably true but I didn't see obvious big mistakes in blacks end game. Maybe it's more small omissions which added up. Therefore I'd like to get a review although it was a fairly fast game.  I added my thoughts with "reviewee:" at the beginning. Thanks! Martin]

Black has no chances after White plays B16. B16 is so big!

Conclusion: You got an early lead in fuseki, but after that ...
Instead of playing simplest moves, you tried to fight and attack and lost all your advantage. Later B was very lucky on the lower side and was one step away from winning the game.]
