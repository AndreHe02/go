C[Game ID: 278550, rateddmg: Hi, I've been playing white in this games and found myself late very early in the game. I've started attacking but my opponent got such a big moyo i did not succeed to reduce enough and ended losing by 6.5points. I'd like to have any comments especially during chuban.

L: I'll mark my comments with L.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc]
;W[qo]C[dmg: is it correct to attack here?

L: Sure, you can approach Q3 like this.];B[pl]
(;W[rl]C[L: This move is a bit unusual. We generally don't like to play on the 2nd line during fuseki unless we are trying to live. Also, the S8 and S9 exchange is in favour of black, becuase black has a shimari at the top-right corner. See variation.]

(;W[hn]C[L: What's this move for? Black cannot capture this stone easily. Even so, white can play H2 and cut black apart. So, white should play somewhere else. For example...]

;B[ff];W[qj]LB[kd:A][oe:B][om:C]C[dmg: is this a good point? I did not knew really where attacking. Those three stones seemed fragile.

;B[qk];W[rj];B[sk]
(;W[pj]LB[oj:B][pj:A]C[dmg: slow move?

L: Indeed, this is a slow move, but it's not bad. However, I do not know where would be the best play. See variation for a suggestion.]

(;B[om]LB[ok:B][om:A];W[ok];B[pm];W[nm];B[nn];W[ml];B[on]C[L: Nice result. Black connected back to his group with no points, while white gained great thickness. Now it's the time to destroy black's moyo.]

(;W[no]LB[kd:B][no:A];B[mm];W[ll]C[L: This is definitely a slow move. This is perhaps the turning point of the game. White should tenuki now, and play L16 if white wants to destroy black's moyo.]
;B[mh];W[qg];B[pf];W[qh];B[fh];W[dh];B[ns];W[or];B[ji]C[dmg: here I feel very late.

L: True, if white is to play L16 now, it'll be a hard battle.  White''s only option is to reduce from outside.]

To summarize: During fuseki, try not to play on the 2nd line unless the follow-up is good. In chuban, tenuki when possible. One of the major issues in the game was not using the thickness the O9 group efficiently.]

C[L: Black 's R9 position works too well with the top-right simari. Also, white still has not settle herself. Either white lives right away with gote, or black can gain territory from attacking the stones.]
))
(;W[pn];B[np];W[rq];B[jq]C[L: This is joseki. You might argue that white played S3, which is a play on the 2nd line. However, this play is essential because it settles white's stones AND ALSO trying to remove black's base at the bottom. That's why the next move black should play at K3 or L3, so black has a base.

White's S8 was simply trying to make a base, and black can comfortably play R9 and gain outside influence.]
