AB[pd][dp]C[Piotr: Hello,
many thanx you've agreed to rewiev our game.
My name is Piotr, I've been playing for some 4-5 months now, and would be grateful if you could point at my mistakes. In this particular game, the balance has been kept with my minor advantage until the last action on the right side, which turned out a complete catastrophy, and I lost by 0.5.
Once again, thank you!


Hi Piotr and Snor,

I hope this review helps you in your future games.

Best regards

Beholder];W[pq];B[po]C[Beholder: Immediately interupting the possible corner enclosure shows fighting spirit ;-)]
;W[qo];B[pp];W[qp];B[oq];W[qq];B[dd]LB[op:A]C[Beholder: The upper left star point is big, but it is dangerous to give White the possibility to cut at A.]

(;W[fd];B[or];W[cf]LB[rs:A]C[Beholder: To not respond to the descent of P2 is dangerous, because of the possible invasion to A. It could cost a lot of territory and precious eye space...]

;W[fe];B[db]
(;W[gb]LB[kc:A]C[Beholder: You don't have to be too concerned about E18. To play somewhere around A would be better.]
;B[dg];W[ch];B[ff];W[gf]C[Piotr: my first (?) serious mistake. 29 around k16 would be better, right? After the next B's play the wall of three stones goes in vain.

Beholder: K16 would be too near to your wall. An earlier extension would have been better.]
;B[id]C[Beholder: This is not a good attack as G15 can be easily protected.]

(;W[he]LB[kd:A]C[Beholder: You don't have to protect here, it would be better to attack with a play around A.]

;B[od];W[rc];B[oc];W[pb];B[pf]C[Beholder: White got the corner in exchange for Blacks strong influence on the left and upper side. Black got the better deal here. Whites stone at M16 looks very lonely.]
;W[oe]C[Beholder: There is no way out of the ladder at the moment. So this move only strengthend Black.]
;B[ne];W[of];B[og];W[lf];B[mf]C[Beholder: Don't touch a stone you are attacking. You only make it stronger.]

;W[on];B[no];W[pj];B[qi];W[qj];B[rj];W[rk];B[oi]C[Piotr: B's mistake (should protect s10)?
