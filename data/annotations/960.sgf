The past moves have given white 6 points. (White had the corner anyway.) To

position AND canapproach white's D16 stone from strength];W[ko]

as well without bothering to play L5.( See variations later)

I would prefer to attack black's lone stone (marked) and use the attack to
build up a position at the top. White is stronger than black here. I like A    White can also still play d or e reducing black's cornrer and supporting the
stone on the right.];B[kn];W[mn]
