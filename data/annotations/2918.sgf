;B[qp]C[Hi!  Thanks for reviewing this game for me.
I am Shanyu. I was black in this game, in the end i lost by15.5point.
I'd like to know where I could improve my play, especially in the joseki and middle game and endgame and where i was not sente. Please see my question.
Thank you very much.

* Review comments are marked with a star like this.

Overall, black gave white overwhelming thickness, mostly because of joseki problems. However, white blundered in lower right by letting black surround a white group and letting black into white moyo on the right. Then black seemed to have chances again. Then black should have strengthened his middle stones while attacking, but did not, and let white capture some of them in the end. 

In places both players make very small moves, which only threaten or save 1 stone or so. Getting rid of this habit is very important. 

I think both players played well for their level. Using thickness is not easy even for much stronger players.]

(;B[cq]C[* c3 is bad as you noticed. This shape is rarely good. 

Hane at d6 is the only good move I know. Variations show something that i think are joseki.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[dp];B[bq];W[cn];B[bo];W[iq]C[i think my moves are bad.how to do?

*Yes, white should be pretty happy now. See joseki comments earlier.]
;B[cf]C[*Instead of c14, i think you should make a shimari in lower right corner, probably o3 or p3, to limit white influence on lower side. If white gets to approach there, white lower side will be huge. Usually shimaris and approaches around 4-3-stones (like r4) are more urgent than around 4-4 stones (like d16).

Approach to d16 maybe should have been from the upper side, because black is stronger there.]
;W[df]
(;B[cd]C[*Again the same mistake. Josekis that I know start with hane d13. There are many variations, I show only one of them. In fact white d14 may not be that good when white don't have stones on the top side where his thickness will be directed after the joseki.]

(;B[cl]C[c8 looks small to me and leaves bad shape where white can play d12. See variation.]
;W[jd];B[hd]C[is this move bad?

* Probably it is. Proverb says 'play away from thickness'. This stone should come under heavy attack which should be profitable for white. I would still play p3 instead.]
;W[fd]C[* White seems too cautious to me. There is no cut for black. I think white should attack from the other, weaker, side.]
;B[hc]C[* I don't think this should help you. You should just jump out at h14, or even abandon h16 for the time being.]

(;W[oe]C[* This seems strange. K16 and p15 are thin, and p15 is not a normal corner approach.]

(;B[mc]C[* I think you shouldn't let white press you down like this. I would just play r15 to take the corner. Then white would need to defend his thin stones.]

;W[ld];B[jc];W[re];B[kd];W[ke];B[kc];W[lf];B[je]C[*This cut and the following capture are small and lose your sente. 

Lower right is much more urgent. 

Now black has small lead in secure territory, but white thickness is overwhelming, and white is surely better off.]
;W[jf];B[id];W[pj];B[if];W[jg];B[oq]C[is this move too slow?

* I think it is necessary but maybe too late. White is so strong that you need to create some secure position that is not easily attacked, and this is a way.]
;W[mq];B[kq]C[not good?

* Hard to say. You need to fight back and it should be difficult whatever you do.]
;W[mo];B[ko];W[io];B[km];W[mm];B[im];W[gn];B[ql]C[* Good you get to play r8.]
;W[qn]C[* This is bad from white, black gets to atttack and white will be defending.]
;B[pn]C[Correct response, as far as I know.];W[qm];B[pm];W[rl]
;B[qk];W[rk];B[qj];W[rj]C[* Result is horrible for white. Black runs into biggest white moyo, and n7 stones start looking weak.]

(;B[oj]C[* I think you should now attack the three white stones. Keima M9 is a common attacking move which also strengthens black center group and reduces white moyo and thickness. White stones cannot be all killed because they can connect by L2 if nothing else, but white no more has a big moyo.]

(;W[qi];B[pk];W[pi];B[ok];W[qo];B[po];W[mk];B[mj]C[* Now you are driving white onto your own group at L7, and that creates the cutting possibility around K6. 

You could play K10 instead to strengthen your group while attacking.]

;B[lo]C[This is too small. T15 is good because it is sente. F18 big and prevents white sente move there. B6 maybe biggest of all. 

Note B6 is anti-sente i.e. prevents a sente move by opponent. It is almost as good as sente.]
