C[Hi reviewer, after taking a thrashing online I decided to play a game against the computer.  I feel like I tend to be too submissive when I play and would like some ideas as to how I could better react to some of the invasions, etc.  In the end I lost by a sizable margin but I didn't feel like I committed too many big errors.  I played as black in this game.  Any and all advice is greatly welcome, thanks!]

(;B[dr]C[I felt like I might be able to do something with this later, perhaps it's a move best forgotten?

I don't see this as a terrible move. but I think there are better options.]
