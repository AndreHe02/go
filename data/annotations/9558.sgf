AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Elathalion [8k\]: hi
Elathalion [8k\]: gl hf];W[dd]C[[Hello Elathalion. I'm ouafouaf on KGS, ranked 2k, I made some comments for your game.\]

You played a solid/safe game all the way, and you were leading until your mistake at move 198. 
I felt that sometimes your moves were TOO safe, making too many heavy/slow moves. But as they say, better safe than sorry, and being carefull allowed you to keep your lead all game long. Near the end, you failed at estimating the whole board situation, and got yourself in trouble when it would have been the best choice to play safe moves. 

So if I may give you a few advices: Keep playing safe (especially against stronger players); try to make your stones more efficient (avoid heavy shapes and such); take some time to estimate the whole board situation (where are the big moves, where are the weak groups, who is leading...).

Have Fun!];B[cf]C[I usually approach the corner in a handicap game... seems like the active way of playing.

[I think it's fine\]];W[nq]
(;B[qn]C[He approaches and i back of just playing peaceful.

[Fine. You don't need to play aggressively as you have the handicap for you. Or you could play somewhere else for influence, but it's not easy to find the good direction. See variation.\]]
;W[ip];B[fq]C[Not sure about this one.. but  i thought i put a bit of pressure on the bottom and start enclosing my corner.

[Fine. Safe move again. Shape is a little strange, I might want to play F4 instead, because of your stone at C14.\]]
;W[co]C[[This looks like an overplay to me.\]];B[cp]C[He probes I thought an d i just take territory with the corner]
;W[cm];B[bd]LB[fc:A][ci:B]TR[ck][lq]C[weired extension from him ... so  i just go towards the corner in the top left. Should i do A or B?

[-A- would be possible too, probably to start a difficult fight for white who doesn't have support. But it's probably better not to look for a fight so early in a handicap game.\]
[-B- seems too passive.\]
[You could have tried to approach on the left at C9 or attack the bottom at M3. But your safe choice at B16 is good too.\]]
;W[ef];B[ci]TR[cm][co]C[he takes outside i go for profit again.. and start narrowing the space for the triangled group

[Free move for you, also weakening his stones on the left. Nothing to complain about.\]]
;W[jd]
(;B[cc]C[He takes the big extension and i go and take the corner. I still have good access to the center and he has very little territory so far..

[C17 is not a good move here. It's a rather big move, but it's not urgent at all, as there are no dangers for you or for white.\]
[You can play on the right, or play aggressively at the bottom. See var.\]]
;W[dc]C[[I think this is not a good exchange for you at this point. You helped white getting thicker.\]
[Check the variations\]]
(;B[do]TR[mc][nc][md][nd][kp][lp][kq][lq]C[D17 is no threat to me I thougt... so I go and threaten the split on C5-C7 while playing super solid and raising my position

[You are already pretty strong here, and your move is not very threatening.\]
[The two white stones are weak, so it's a good idea to attack them, but you have to get something out of it.\]
[In my opinionm it would be better to play the big points left (top right maybe), or to invade the bottom part.\]]

[Your middle group doesn't need anything, the white dead group next to it has only 3 liberties.\]
[At this point, you have virtually won already. You have at least 60 or 70 points of secure territory, and white only has about 30 or 40. All you need to do is some reduction at the bottom and at the top.\]
