C[Hi, my name is Jay, and I will be reviewing you game.  My comments start with "J:"]
;B[dp];W[pq]C[Manolack [9k\]: hi gl

lesamourai [8k\]: hi gg];B[qd];W[dd];B[po]C[Is it a good approach for B ?

J: so far so good.];W[qm]C[I'm bad with this kind of pincer..

J: my one little nit about this pincer is that since the r16 stone is already low, it means that when the q5 stone splits the white group, the r7 group will be too low. 

That being said, it's a matter of taste, and it's very playable.]
;B[pm]TR[on][qq]C[J: q7 is weird, r3 to take the corner and make a base, or p6 for a strong outside are normal.  lets see how this plays out...]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[J; the split here is good.];W[ql]TR[pn]C[J: white should consider pushing q6 first.  makes either two black groups or cutting points. r8 seems very slow.]
;B[op]
(;W[oq]C[J: white can maybe jump here, sacrificing a small corner for more speed.  See variation.]
;B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[mr];B[lq];W[rq]C[B has some influence on the center. Is B and W equals for the moment ?

J: I'd say it's close, black feels ahead slightly only because r6 group isn't safe yet.]
(;B[oc]C[B made a shimari but his potential is wasted because of R8 W's group. So the shimari was a bad idea ?

J: the shimari is big, but there may have been a more natural way to get it.  See variation.]
;W[on]C[J: proverb: "don't peep a cutting point."  Black should just have played q6, and p6 would seem silly.]
;B[oo];W[nn];B[no];W[pn]C[I think i probably lost the game here. The influence of B is in destroyed for the most part. Are you agree ? What B should have played ?

J: black should q6 immediately after the peep.];B[mn];W[mm]
;B[ln];W[lm];B[kn]C[J: black here is too submissive.];W[hp]
TR[pg][ph][qh][qg][cn]C[J: this invasion is too early, consider the large extensions to the right or the left approach to prevent a double wing.]
;B[iq]TR[fq][km]MA[jr][kr][ks][js]C[J; again, submissive.  There are no points at the X's... Try attacking at a larger scale with the triangle points.]
;W[ip];B[jp];W[hq];B[ir];W[lr];B[kr]C[J; This is painful for black, should omit L2 to play big-points making moves.]
;W[hr];B[jo]MA[hr][hq][hp][ip]C[J: white's h4 overplay has left him with a weak position, black should attack it to make points elsewhere.]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[ep];B[do];W[eo];B[cm]TR[en]C[Am I too territorial with C7 ? is E6 better ?

J: yes, the hane at E6 would be more aggressive.];W[cf];B[jd]
C[K17 better ?

J; either.];W[lc];B[kc];W[ld];B[gc]TR[jf][kf]C[J: how about keep white running a bit more with the triangled points instead.  This will make the extension stronger.]
;W[ic]C[Can I prevent J17 splitting my group ?

J: J16 to connect and make influence.];B[ge];W[hd];B[gd];W[he]
;B[hf];W[ie];B[jf];W[je];B[db]C[I wanted to kill him but i was a little afraid so i abandonned some stones in order to survive. Could i kill J15 W's group ?

J: nope.];W[cc];B[ff];W[kf];B[qh]C[Is R12 a big point ? Is there a bigger point ?

J: this looks the biggest, but black's F14 group still has no eyes.]
;W[qe];B[re]C[Maybe i should fight here.. IS Q15 better ?];W[pe]
;B[rf];W[pd]
(;B[qc]C[J: if I'm not mistaken, black's q17 actually works.  See variation.]
;W[pc];B[pb];W[qb];B[rb];W[ob];B[qa];W[nc];B[nb];W[od];B[oa]
;W[mb];B[oc];W[ec];B[eb];W[ob]C[J: this ko is too small to fight right now.]
;B[en];W[na];B[pa]C[J: letting white take here means sente for black elsewhere at a loss of 3 points?]
;W[hn];B[fn];W[go];B[cb];W[bc];B[if];W[kd];B[oh]C[I wanted to reduce the potential W territories]
;W[cj];B[dh]C[J: c12 here is white's weak point.];W[ch];B[dg]
;W[cg];B[di];W[ci];B[rk];W[qk];B[rj];W[qj];B[qi];W[jj];B[fc]
C[J: wasted move.];W[cl];B[bm];W[bl];B[fo];W[fp];B[er];W[fr]
;B[dr];W[bq]C[What can he do here ??];B[bo];W[bp];B[br];W[co]
;B[cn];W[ao];B[bn];W[dm];B[dn];W[el];B[oj];W[pj];B[oi];W[ok]
;B[nk];W[nl];B[ro]C[J: too little too late.];W[mk];B[nj];W[km]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[sq];B[ii];W[gg];B[gf]C[G14 too defensive ?

J: probably, either way, black cannot make that many points here.]
;W[gi];B[fh];W[gh];B[hj];W[gj];B[gk];W[fj];B[hb];W[ib];B[ed]
;W[de];B[ef]C[J: no need, black is already connected.];W[nf]

;B[dc];W[cd];B[fk];W[ej];B[gm]C[J: G7 can be omitted until white actually cuts at h9.]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[ek];B[em];W[eh]C[J: white is fightling over very little points here.]

Thanks by advance for reviewing. And sorry for my bad english

J: Thanks for showing me this game.  I think the best take-away is to not play submissive moves and wasteful moves.  Think of each wasted move as a free move for your opponent.]

(;B[ro];W[qh];B[oc]C[J: s5 causes white to strengthen his group, but that extension is like an approach to the corner from the wrong side.  Yet the white group is still very weak.]
