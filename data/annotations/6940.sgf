C[buckyyowza: Hello! Comments by Mark Fyffe, prefixed by 'buckyyowza'.  I hope you enjoy reading my comments and find them to be of use.

stiknork [6k\]: hi
stiknork [6k\]: have a good game
voice [6k\]: hi
voice [6k\]: u 2];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[nc]C[OK here I really wanted to play O16 but decided to relax in this game and played S14 but then he ended up getting the top sideand it seemd like he was ahead the whole game]
;B[qf]C[buckyyowza:  This is best choice here.  Once more stone at Q9 or Q10 makes the right side very large for black.  O16 leaves too much settled after the joseki for my taste, and in this position things are very open and flexible, which makes white's upper side more vulnerable, but only after a successful invasion on the left or the center.]
;W[jd]
(;B[pj]C[buckyyowza: Too slack, black is now behind.  After K16, it is urgent to invade the upper left in sente. See var for the right timing for Q10.

I don't know a follow up to S14 so I did this.
Is there a follow up to S14?];W[jp]C[Here I felt like he had a huge moyo and I had next to nothing.

So I played C10 but that just seemed to help him.

Is there a better way to play?];B[cj];W[cl];B[cg];W[ce];B[dn]
LB[ej:B][ek:A][fq:C]TR[cg][cj]C[buckyyowza: bad choice.  White can play E8 now, kill one of these groups, then chase the other across the board gobbling up moyo.  E9 is best to reduce now, E10 even better to extend without aji keshi - causing white to build a wall.  Even without D6, F3 is still an invasion point as long as white isn't very developed off of C8.

I chose to try and reduse at this point, but I was at a loss as to where I should play to do that.

Could I have played else where?];W[cn];B[dm];W[cm];B[ek]C[I think he could have done a lot better here, but I don't know how.]
;W[dl];B[el]C[buckyyowza: This is about as good as black can hope after playing D6.]
;W[em]
(;B[fm]LB[fp:A][hp:B]C[buckyyowza: I would advise against this line of play.  Black is helping white to build thickness and seal off the lower side, which is much bigger than the center. I prefer F4 or H4 is this situation.]
;W[en];B[fn];W[eo]
(;B[go]C[buckyyowza: This needs to be deeper.  From G3, you can connect underneath if the upper path fails. See var.]
;W[gp];B[hp]LB[fd:A][ld:B]C[buckyyowza: This area is too difficult at this point.  Better for black to use this new thickness to invade the upper side.  Think about F16 or M16 now.

Move 29 - 40 I think was really bad for me.but I thought that I could reduse him some and tryed.

iI there a was to reduse him here?];W[ho];B[gq];W[fp];B[io]
;W[hn];B[in]C[buckyyowza: oops :)  Try J4];W[ip];B[hq];W[hm]

;B[qm];W[lj];B[gd]C[Trying to reduse again];W[fl];B[fk];W[gl]
;B[hk]C[buckyyowza: This is much better aji for black.  This move was OK.

I don't know if I needed to take that stone.
I just thought that it looked a lot better for black.

Did I need to take it?];W[gc];B[hc]C[buckyyowza:  When invading like this, lean toward the corner - so play F17 instead.  It is typically easier to live in the corner than on the side if you get disconnected.]
;W[hd]
(;B[id]C[buckyyowza: not to repeat comments, but lean toward the corner ;)  Play F17 instead, see var.]

;W[mg];B[mf];W[lh];B[pg]C[buckyyowza: yes, O15 kills the black stones.

Can he play O15 and hope to take my stones?]
(;W[oj];B[lg]C[Random....];W[kg]
(;B[pi]C[buckyyowza: Take the ko in sente.  It is usually best to finish what you start, even if you change your mind, at least as long as the sente lasts.  This is a solid move, but is gote.  Taking the ko lets you put this sort of play off while keeping sente.]

;W[bl];B[er]C[buckyyowza: this is OK, no worries. see var on 111

bad, bad, bad];W[fq];B[fr];W[kr]
(;B[ks];W[ir];B[kq];W[gr];B[kp]C[here he could have just taken them and saved his stones at N4 right?

buckyyowza: correct.];W[jo];B[ko];W[jn];B[ln];W[kn];B[lo];W[cq]
;B[is];W[hr];B[nm];W[mm]
(;B[mn]TR[ln][lo]C[buckyyowza: note the empty triangle shape.  even as part of a bigger group, this shape is still ineffective.  black has presence on both sides of the situation, try P6 instead.]

;W[hh];B[gg];W[pk]C[buckyyowza: black needs S10 now to prevent a full invasion.

Instead he could have played at R8 and would have got more right?

But is that thwe best move for me?]

I got worried and protected];W[se]C[He has more kos then I do so I played one up

buckyyowza: ko or not, T16 is disaster ;-)  see var.]
(;B[rd];W[sd];B[sc];W[sf];B[rc];W[po];B[qo];W[pp];B[pq];W[dk]
C[Was that the best he could do?

buckyyowza: not much. black is pretty solid here because of the eye + several liberties at j9.  This is probably white's best move on the board because it is sente and doesn't give up the opportunity for more points.]

[os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[buckyyowza: Interesting game :) Thanks for the opportunity to look through it.  I'd say in all that black's play is 2 stones stronger after the first 50 moves or so.  A little more care in the opening would have made this game an easy win for black.  As it was, there was more of a struggle than should have been needed.  Be sure to always keep sente early on in order to keep control of the flow of plan - it is easiest to succeed at your own plan than your opponent's ;)  Please let me know if you have any further questions about this game!
