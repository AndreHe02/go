C[I was Black. I think went wrong on move 20.

On various moves I made some comments, please see what  else I did wrong and if my comments make any sense.

forfun (hereafter ff) - This was quite a complex game.  Both sides played hard.  It was interesting to try to analyze.

Overall I had the feeling that Black has a tendency to undervalue the stones already played and to change course a little too quickly.  I think Black could improve by trying to understand the broader potential of the stones on the board and how to get maximum advantage out of them.

One other point.  Black's game was spoiled in the late going by a couple of serious blunders.  I noticed in the game info that the game was played with 15 minutes main time followed by 10-second byo-yomi.  10-second time limits can be fun, but they are not going to help you improve :-)]
;B[qf]C[I play here just to avoid the "normal" joseki's.];W[dp]
;B[dd]
(;W[qd]C[ff - An interesting idea.  Black's stone at R14 will be left in an odd position if Black plays in the bottom right.]

(;B[oc]C[ff - Black transposes into a "normal" joseki that is typically played when Black holds the bottom right corner.  When Black only holds the upper left there is bound to be some question of whether this gives a good result.]
;W[od];B[nd];W[oe];B[pc];W[qe]
(;B[ne]C[I am not sure about this move. R 17 better ? I did not like a move at O15 then.

ff - The question is whether this is "aji keshi" or not.  Naturally Black gains on the top but White *should* get compensation on the right (see the variations).  This is not a bad play as such but the thinking is perhaps questionable.  We amateurs often fear being forced by our opponents more than we should.  We have to become better at assessing whether we are being forced to hurt ourselves or, in fact, to help ourselves. Here Black should welcome a White push at O15 rather than fear it (see the variations).]

(;W[qc]C[ff - Not a reasonable idea for White.  The issue is the outside not the corner.  Strategically when Black plays a double pincer against a stone on R16 (whether the P17-R14 combo here or a taisha or any of the other common types), the idea is to let White keep the corner while building strength on the outside.  White's counter strategy must be to keep Black separated in order to attack one side or the other.  Here White dives into the corner and Black is able to wrap completely around the White position.  White happens to fight back in this game but at this point the advantage is clearly to Black.]
;B[of]C[ff - A big plus for Black.  There are cutting points but it is not clear that White can take advantage of them.]

(;W[rf]C[ff - Very painful for White. However, there does not seem to be an alternative. See the variation...]

(;B[qg]C[ff - This way Black ends in gote.  What about Q14 instead? See the variation...]
;W[rg];B[qh]C[ff - Although Black is happy to force White into such a low position, there is no good time to fix the cutting point at O14.]
;W[nf]
(;B[mc]C[This moves seems too slack and gives white a cahnge to develop O14. Better at P13 ??

ff - I think that P13 is the only idea that makes sense here. The O17 cut does not work yet for White.  Thus Black chooses to protect against a play that White can not make at this time.  

Fundamentally Black should think carefully before protecting against the O17 cut in any case. White has already been forced to play two low stones on the right at S14 and S15. Black should not mind giving up the two stones at the top since they have already done their job. The real question now is whether White can erase Black's outside influence, not whether White can cut and capture the two stones.  Therefore the key stone on the board right now is White's O14.  If this escapes into the center, Black's influence will inevitably be reduced.  If Black can capture this stone, or alternatively force it to live on a small scale in the upper center, Black can maintain and develop central influence.]
;W[og]C[ff - Very painful for Black.  The Black shape on the right makes no sense now.]
;B[pf];W[mf]
(;B[rh]C[Better at R9 ?

ff - This is the kind of play you make when you can threaten the corner. See the variation on White's next play.  The alternatives look more interesting right now.  Again the focus should not be making a low life along the right side but rather about finding a way to attack in the center.]

(;W[ld]C[ff - Again a painful play for Black.  Black has paid dearly for the slow stone at N17.]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[jc];W[oj];B[qk];W[qm];B[ok];W[nj];B[ql]C[I did not like playing here, it provokes Q7. Q10 better ??

ff - Q10 just asks White to play Q8 so I do not think it is better.  The real question is not here but Black's next play in my opinion.]
;W[pm]
(;B[nk]C[ff - Bad shape that only seems to help White.  Black has to follow up White Q7 with R8.]
;W[mk]C[ff - The classic "hane at the head of two stones".  Black should be very disappointed with the result of O9.]
;B[ml]
(;W[pp]C[ff - Very odd defensive play at this point...]
(;B[mh]C[Turns out bad. What is betterM9 then O7 ?

ff - See the variations for alternatives.  Fundamentally this attack is too deep.  Generally speaking when we play close attacking stones we voluntarily limit the scale of our potential gain.  Only when we have otherwise established a sizable framework that allows us to make a substantial gain by killing our opponents' stones do we want to move in for the kill.  Playing close too early in the fight just gives our opponent counter chances, as in this game.]
;W[lj]C[ff - White wisely does not answer inside.]
(;B[ng]C[ff - Black plays a second poor move to justify the first.  I recognise this strategy from my own games! :-)]
;W[mg];B[nh];W[lh];B[oh];W[kg];B[mi]C[ff - This is a good forcing play.  But the follow up should have been different.  See the next play...]
;W[mj]

;W[ki];B[kj];W[ll];B[ji];W[kh]
(;B[nl]C[ff - Black can not afford to go back here. The Black group on the right is alive. There is one eye at P13 and another along the edge. If Black can not attack the upper White stones then the whole strategy of cutting at L10 was wrong.]

ff - No, I think this is a nicer idea.];W[dm];B[hj];W[ek]C[ff - I think this is not the right approach for White...]
;B[ii]C[ff - This is a truely massive capture.  White's upper center is almost dead.  Both 3-3 points on the lower side are still open.  Black still has the N6, O4 combination to play on the lower right.  I would rather be playing Black than White here.]
;W[ie];B[ic];W[ig];B[gh];W[cf];B[ch]C[ff - White comes up with a good reply here.  It looks like this should be on D12 instead of C12.]
