RE[B+Resign]

C[
J: Hello. My name is Joe and I am roughly 2d AGA. All of my comments in this game will start with a "J:".]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd];W[cf];B[cj];W[fc];B[ee];W[cc]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[dg];W[ed];B[de];W[bd]C[J: This should be saved, since it ends in gote. F15 is a vital point for seperating the black stones and getting to the center.
In this case, B responds incorrectly. See variation after b B15, w B17.]
;B[be];W[bc]
(;B[ce]C[J: This connection by black was not needed. See variation.]
;W[fe]C[I felt ok about this result. I didn't really know how any other way to handle C10

J: This result is great for white. B's stones are overconcentrated, and his stones are not working well together.]
;B[jq]C[Seems there is no obvious (to me) direction & way to attack this stone

something like b H3 O3 P3 O4 Q5 (leaving F3 weakness)
or H3 O3 Q6 Q2 R3 M4 (also leaving F3 weakness) is what i would expect (also possible from M3 of course)
Neither one seemed too tempting atm

J: I added your variation for referrence, as well as another variation to consider starting with G3.]

(;W[qf];B[qj]C[Again this wide pincher maybe i should have gone again for O17 here?

J: O17 would have a tough time with the K16 stone in place. This is fine.]

(;W[of]C[J: This move leaves you with a cramped group. See possible variation starting with R17.]
;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc]
(;W[lq]C[J: R12 was the first move I considered here to settle the group. If black gets here first, w would be uncomforable.
If you want to play in this area, I would consider holding back a line at N3. That way you do not leave a weakness at O3 for later.]

(;B[qm]
(;W[qo]C[J: You don't want to respond here. The black stones above are not threatened by this. It does prevent an R3 invasion, but O3 remains for later making it hard to get points here. 
You'd rather attack K3, but again, the O3 weakness prevents you from attacking it too strongly.
The problem is M3's location is too far away from the corner and would be better at N3.]
;B[gq];W[cm];B[dr];W[cq]C[Any other moves possible here?

J: This is fine. Your group is now stable.];B[nq]
(;W[np]C[J: This move seems problematic, since b has strong groups on each side and it fails to get points.
I would consider Q3 here, which solidifies the corner and leaves it up to black to deal with the M3 stone.]
;B[mq];W[mp];B[lr];W[lp];B[kr];W[pi]C[J: This move needs to be at P3 to settle the corner.]
;B[pr];W[oq];B[or]
(;W[qi]C[J: With the lower right corner floating, it is best to look for a way to connect while attacking.
Starting to press with Q10 would help out the group and could look at making a center moyo. This move does not secure many points for you.]
;B[pj];W[oj]C[J: You are settling your upper right group here, but you are strengthening the black group as well. 
With your lower right stones floating, things can get tough.]
;B[ok]
(;W[oi]C[J: This is timid. Better to play towards the center with O10.]
;B[ol]
(;W[cr]C[J: This only helps black. See variation.];B[eq];W[lc]
;B[gd];W[fd];B[gc];W[le]C[a big cut around N14 still though. but didn't see any better ways than the M17 invasion

J: There is nothing to fear from the cut, since your group at P14 is solid. See variation.]

(;B[rc]
(;W[mc]C[J: This is where you should be attacking K16. This move seems to help out black more than anything.]
;B[nc];W[mf];B[jf]C[J: You missed your oppertunity to play here first.]
;W[mm];B[rn];W[ro];B[ri];W[rh];B[rj];W[fg];B[eg];W[fh];B[fb]
;W[eb];B[gb];W[hf];B[if];W[he];B[id];W[jb];B[kb];W[kc];B[ib]

(;W[lb]C[J: Playing K17 was your last chance to attack black here.]
;B[jc];W[ka];B[jh]C[J: At this point the game looks over. All of blacks groups are settled, and the lower right still needs to find its eyes. 
Black has a solid lead, in large part due to the play in the lower right.]

J: You gained quite a bit in the center. B's biggest gain came from R3.]
;W[bo];B[dl];W[gi];B[ji];W[ki];B[pe]C[I felt i was behind so wanted to respond as little as possible]

(;W[hp];B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[qh];B[og];W[oh]C[i know i can't fight this ko. game is pritty much over here but the last moves are just desperation. i felt like i was still behind

J: You caught up some with your points in the center. You are still behind. However, this is a ko you can't win.]

;B[je];W[pg];B[mg];W[rg];B[lf];W[ke];B[me];N[RESULT]C[Result: B+Resign

J: You gained some in the 2nd half of this game, but you couldn't recover from your rough start.
With some work on attack and defense in the very beginning, you will have a greatly improved game.
Also be sure to watch surrounding stones on the board. Your last chance to attack was missed because you over-estimated your weaknesses.
