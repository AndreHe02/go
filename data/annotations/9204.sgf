C[Bulut: Hello !! In this game, my opponent played I don't get used to. I had some problems about answering him. There is a tournament in 30 August. Before that, I have to learn more non-joseki moves :) Thanks for comments. (I am not Native speaker, sorry for my bad english :))

N: Hi, I play as Numsgil 2k on KGS.  I've prefixed my comments with N.]
;B[pp];W[dq];B[pd];W[ed];B[pj];W[gp];B[cd]C[Bulut: Maybe bad for sanrensei opening ?
It was my first time to see 5-4 point fuseki. Because of that, I was confused.

N: Don't worry too much if you haven't seen a position before.  Just try to decide what your plan is.  This move is probably fine.]
;W[dc];B[cg]TR[cc]C[N: When white kicks, unless you're very very certain, you need to play at triangle.  The resulting shape, with your stones in a line and white's stones in a diagonal, is good for you.  You need to play at triangle here.  If white plays triangle, he gets a lot of profit and you owe another move in the area to stabilize your stone and make life.]
;W[cc]C[N: Bad for you, good for white.];B[jd]TR[cj]C[I want to pincer left-top W stones and save my moyo. Are there another urgent moves ?

N: A move around triangle is important.  I wouldn't tenuki, unless you consider the whole last exchange as a probe.  If white plays at triangle, you're going to have to either abandon the group or run, and both are bad.]
;W[ce];B[co]C[N: Abandoning the group is probably a good idea, yeah.]
;W[cm];B[cq]C[Last hope to life for me :(  What you would play, if it was you ?]
;W[dp];B[cp];W[do];B[dn]TR[dr]C[N: This isn't a good move.  Play hane at the bottom (triangle) and leave this whole side unplayed.]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq]TR[dn]C[I think it is good for me. Now, White stone at G4 is useless and overconcentrated. Am I right ?

N: better not to have played triangle, but yes, this is reasonable.  White is slightly overconcentrated.]
;B[en]C[N: Too early.  If white adds a move to capture that stone, all the better.  By playing this now, you're committing yourself to making these stones useful, which is hard.]
;W[el];B[cj]C[N: Good, now you have a base for these stones.]
;W[nq]C[N: White needs to make the bottom big to get some points from his overconcentration.]
;B[oq]TR[lq]C[N: No, better to pincer.  You don't want white to make the bottom large, and this move does not protect the corner or the right side.  You're just helping white.]
;W[np];B[qn];W[ei];B[di];W[dh];B[ch];W[eg];B[ej];W[fi];B[dl]
;W[dm];B[em];W[dk];B[cl];W[ck];B[bl];W[bk];B[ek]C[It is meaningless ?]
;W[fl];B[bm];W[dj];B[ci];W[fj]C[N: You can connect your two groups in gote.  Might be better than trying to make to separate groups live.]

(;B[be];W[bd];B[cf];W[de];B[bj]C[N: Not good.  Better to do the connecting under thing I showed before.]
;W[ak];B[aj];W[fk];B[af];W[ah]C[He couldn't kill my stones.
Is there a way for capturing that stones ?

N: Not yet, I don't think.  If you lose the liberties on the outside, it might be possible.]
;B[bh];W[nc];B[lc]TR[oc]C[I didn't like this move.
Is it bad pincer in this situation ?

N: Since white is so strong to the left, this is fine.  It helps you settle your stone on the top.  The other option would be to abandon the stone on the top and kick at triangle, but you'd have to be confident you could still make life on the top and not give up too many points on the right side, and I'm not sure either is true.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[qb]C[It is strange move to me. I didn't take risk and I played solid in here.
Can I punish him or is this a safe move ?];B[qc]C[N: This is fine.  After white crawls back you have sente.  And he still doesn't have two eyes.]
;W[pb];B[gc]C[N: good.];W[jb]C[Here we go !   I can't find what is mistake here. But I think he ruined my game with following moves.

N: You need a plan here.  ALl you need to get out of these stones is life.  Though if you can keep pressure on the stones to the right, all the better.  With that in mind, your play in game wasn't bad.]
;B[lb]C[N: Okay, you want to apply pressure to the stones on the right.]
;W[hb];B[gb]TR[hc]C[N: Be very sure you know what you're doing when you make moves like this.  Sometimes being passive and playing at triangle is all you need to do to keep your stones connected and reasonably secure.  You still need to find eyes either way, though, or keep running.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[gd]C[N: White is strong here, so he can afford to make this cut.  Don't let white cut you when you're near white strength.]
;B[ic]C[N: You'll probably need to sacrifice the stones on the left.  As long as you have strength to attack the stones on the right, it's fine.]
;W[ib];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[db];B[kb];W[ea];B[jc];W[ga]TR[ge]
C[N: Make this forcing move before leaving.];B[nd]TR[le]C[N: No, don't try to attack these stones piecemeal.  Attack the whole thing while keeping your stones alive with a move at something like triangle.]
;W[od];B[md];W[pc]TR[oe]C[N: White is letting you get the outside in exchange for scooping out the corner.  Take him up on his offer.]
;B[oe];W[oc];B[qd];W[rc];B[rd];W[rb]TR[ne]C[N: You have sente, but the cutting stone at triangle is a problem.  See the variation for one thing you could try.]

(;B[lh]C[N: This is really loose.  It doesn't help the stones at the top very much, and it doesn't make much solid territory on the right side.]
;W[mf];B[kf];W[lg];B[kg];W[mh]C[Can white live here ? o.O

N: Quite possibly.  You left white a great deal of aji with his cutting stone.  White probably shouldn't have tried this immediately, but left it in reserve for later, though.]

;B[kj];W[oj];B[nk];W[oi];B[ok];W[pi];B[qi];W[pk];B[qj];W[mk]
;B[ol]TR[pl]C[N: Triangle is better, as it leaves less aji and accomplishes pretty much the same thing.]
;W[kk];B[jj];W[jk];B[ij];W[ik];B[gn];W[jp];B[oo]TR[nr][or]C[I want to reduce his area, but i think this move is little slow :/

N: White has no good way to seal it anyway.  Something like the triangles reduce it from the bottom and protect the corner.]
;W[no];B[or]TR[nr]SQ[oo][np][pp][oq]C[N: Triangle is gote, but I think it's better still.  The shape you're making with the stones marked with squares is weak, and you aren't doing much to protect it.]
;W[nr];B[on];W[nn];B[nm];W[mm];B[ho];W[hp];B[io];W[jo];B[jn]
;W[im];B[in];W[jm];B[kn];W[lp];B[hh]TR[ns]C[N: Make the triangle exchange first.  You should get sente out of it.]
;W[ig];B[hg];W[he];B[if];W[hf];B[ih];W[fn];B[fm];W[fo];B[gm]
TR[gl]C[N: Triangle is better, because it accomplishes the same thing and also reduces white's ability to connect slightly.]
;W[hj];B[oh]C[Thank you for all comments :) One day I will reach your level and I will request a game from you :) Until that day, good-bye :)]
