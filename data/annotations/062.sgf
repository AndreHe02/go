;W[dp]C[I see a couple of possible responses for black here.  The ones that stand out to me are

C5 and E5 -- both solid, and increasing black's liberties.  Follow variation 1 (node 294)

to look at a possible result from C5.  Follow variation 2 (node 308) to look at a possible
result from E5.]
(;B[fo];W[co];B[cn]C[I think I erred here.  Shoule extend up? If so, does that make f5  too close?      I agree -- C6 looks iffy to me as well -- and I like D6.  Playing D6 doesn't
make F5 too close -- but if you end up playing D7 and D8 it would.  White will

probably play C6 after your D6 -- take advantage of F5 being solid to close the bottom
with a move like F3.   C6 may be ok,  but it gets very complicated.];W[dn]
;B[eo];W[cm]C[
 fmaus 24k : i don't like this at  all. :-(

No, it isn't good, but white does give you a chance to escape later...]
;B[bn];W[bo]C[Black should think of B7 at this point -- I won't follow it, it is one of those   complicated variations that I mentioned -- but it may give a better result than
to be gotten by B7.  It does cut white into two groups.];B[dm];W[an]
(;B[en]C[Black shouldn't capture here -- but should instead extend to B7.  See variation 1 on

previous move (node 301) for what this sequence ends up looking like, and compare the

difference in thickness (black is thick, not heavy) and how much worse white's position
is along the left edge.];W[bm];B[dn]C[
 fmaus 24k : i've been getting into fights much earlier lately];W[ck];B
[jp]C[You've seen this point before, but this move might be better played at F3 -- this walls  white in, and builds your outside influence.]
;W[gq];B[ho];W[iq];B[jq];W[ip];B[io];W[gp];B[qj]C[g4 certainly didn't SEEM like a threat, so I went on open point on  right side.

This is a minor threat, and weakens your ability to fight if white
should cut at K5.  It does make any attempt to cut off the white  stones in this area a lot more difficult.]
;W[qo]C[was r10 proper?  I could have shimari'd here, but then there's no  potential fro extension on bottom, and white would invade anyway.  Why would  he invade near my stronger side?

R10 is the right direction, and the right general area.  But, with your
thickness along the bottom, you should probably play high on this side to
continue building influence, so I would have picked Q10 rather than R10.

I agree that neither shimari looks to be worth making.];B[pm];W[oo];B[np]
;W[on]C[This is not a good move by white -- it encourages black to make thickness right where

black wants it, and it doesn't move out quickly enough.  A far better choice would be   O5 (leaning on the black stone), or if white is horribly worried about his R5 stone
being cut off, O6 covers the cut, and allows white to move farther out.]
;B[om];W[mn];B[ml];W[mo]C[Another horrible move for white... far too slow, far too heavy!  N6 is already connected

to the rest of the group -- so play something that moves forward.  M7, L6, and L5 are all
interesting possibilities.];B[km]C[Good -- shutting white in completely.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[rq];B[mp];W[qn];B[qm];W[rr];B[pr];W[pp]C[This does threaten to play P3 later -- which might be messy for the black group below,
especially if white has been able to make the cut at K5 first.];B[rm]C[
 fmaus 24k : :)];W[rn];B[kd]C[High this time, good. :-)];W[oc]L[kf]C
[This looks like an overplay by white -- a reducing move, possibly at L14 (a) is probably
more appropriate.];B[od];W[oe];B[nc]C[At this point something simple and solid is probably preferable.  Either the extension to

O16, or the connection Q16 are both good choice, and the absolutely cut white into two

groups.  When an opponent invades your moyo/territory, the BEST thing to do is cut as  often as is reasonable.  Of the two, I think I like O16 best.]
;W[pd];B[nd];W[pc];B[pe];W[qe];B[pf];W[qf];B[pg];W[rd];B[qg];W[rf]C[White can play S13 here safely, and probably should.]
;B[fc]C[Again, I think this should be on the 4th line, not the third.  Your strategy has all been   very centre oriented, and you should continue this way, by a 4th line play.  Either F16

if you want to stay closer to your own stones, or I also would like a play at E16.  Of
course, with this white (invasion happy), F16 might be a better choice.]
;W[hd]L[fe]C[White has invaded a bunch, but this one seems riskiest.  Is it?    This is a severe overplay by white.  A far better choice, available since
black made the error of playing on the 3rd line, is the capping play at
F15 (a).


If White were thick/strong along the bottom, he might be able to get away with this

play.  That is if he already a stone somewhere around D13/D14.  Even so, this stone
should probably be used as a sacrifice for further reduction.];B[ge]M[fe]
C[This is too aggressive -- you don't need to kill white immediately, and you are giving   yourself un-needed cutting points.  The simple one-point jump to F15 (mark) is correct.

Go proverb: a one-point jump into the centre is never wrong.];W[he];B[hf]
C[Again, too aggressive -- if you let white run straight up, where is he going to escape to?

He is just running towards your thickness at the bottom.  By doing this you give white

cutting points that would allow him to escape.  Maintain the pressure with a simple   extension to G14.  (Remember, white has stones on the left side of the board, the ladders
on that side will be in his favour.)];W[gf];B[hg]C[You finally extended!  But in this case, the stone at risk is the G15 one.  A pull back to   F15 would be a good choice --then if black ataris your H14 stone (from either side) you  can just pull back towards your own strength.   

(At this point, white can actually escape by playing G16 (atari) -- see var1.]

(;W[fe]C[As I noted -- this should be at G16.];B[gd];W[je];B[kf]C[I don't like this one -- you seem to be just setting yourself up to have lots of cutting

points.  If you have to extend up, I like L15 better -- other possibilities are K16,

or K13.  I think I like K13 best -- the L16 stone isn't going to get into much trouble,

but the play of K16 is potentially helpful for the G16 group.  (If Black K16, white
somewhere towards the centre, then black H17 connects.)];W[jf];B[jg];W[ke]
;B[lf];W[le];B[me];W[ld];B[kc];W[lc]C[White should play at G16, since is sente for him, before continuing with this descent.]
;B[hc];W[jd]C[White should play J17 insted of K16.];B[jc];W[lb];B[nb];W
[kg];B[qc];W[qb];B[kh]C[Is there a better way to deal with this cut since LM14 are weak.   (ladder not going to work, so what's best way to deal?

Yes.  Play solid, if you can't ladder -- don't start.  The simple extension
of K12 makes your H13/H14 stones look a lot better, and makes whites stone
look very unhealthy.  It also gives you the ladder the other way should it
be needed.  (And that ladder works.)];W[lg];B[mf];W[lh];B[ki]C[Again, try for solidity -- the connection at K12 is a good choice.  These stones aren't

going anywhere -- so you don't have to pressure them so hard -- and it removes cutting
points of your own on the outside.];W[li];B[lj];W[jh]C[Am I right here?  did I need l10 first?   Well, as I said previously, you should have played K12 instead of L11.
But I don't think you need L10 first -- though it is the more solid, and is
a better move.];B[ig];W[ji];B[kj];W[ni];B[ij];W[gg];B[gh];W[jb];B[ic];W

[ja]C[This is no better than j19, right? both lead to same result?

Yes, both lead to the same result -- it doesn't matter which you choose.]
;W[la];B[ia];W[fb]C[Instead of playing the N19 next, black can make a second eye by playing G19.  (If white
tries to falsify it with G18, black E18 captures the white stones.


But, Variation 1(node297) follows the far more interesting choice for black -- to cut
at E18.]

(;B[jn]C[I played here to protect my center.  the cut at k5 seems to not be a  threat since I should be able to live at bottom.  Is this right way to  play?

No.  Connect at K5.  White can't break into your centre anyway -- but he
has a very good chance of killing or severly damaging your group at the
bottom.

(Sequence of white's best attempt to break into centre on variation 1 of
previous move.)];W[jo];B[fj]C[Living at the bottom is far larger than this -- I'd probably start with the descent to
K2, then something like O2 to make shape.];W[ei]C[Ick.  Horrible shape (empty triangle) -- either play this at E10 (with the willingness to

give up the two white stones at G14) or jump to D11 -- then black E10, white D10, black E11,
White E12 gives better shape.];B[ej];W[dj];B[el];W[dk]C[Bad -- not sente (though it is reverse sente) gives horrible shape, and isn't worth more  than about 2 points.  There are far better choices -- T11 for instance.]
;B[ek]C[Even worse -- you responded to white's move as if it were forcing!  Again, this is 2 points
in gote.  K2, P4, E18, P18, and S13 are all much larger end game moves.]
;W[kn];B[jm];W[kq];B[lq]C[You are quite correct to give up the K3 stones.]
;W[jr];B[kr];W[kp];B[lr]C[It is much easier for Black if he plays this at N2, it is better because it is

a step towards breaking the big internal space up into (at least) two seperate pieces (eyes)

which is what is need to live.  If white ataris at L1 -- simply connect, the ko doesn't
even need to be fought.];W[nr]C[One of white's best tries to kill, the other reasonable try is P3.  Blacks only response

that lives is O3 -- it simultaneously protects the opening at P4 and threatens to make
a second eye at N4.  Variation 1 follows this sequence.]

territory by playing the (very important) connection at C8 is far bigger.]
;B[md]C[Because white requires the approach move at G19, N16 is not needed yet.]
;W[ll]C[The whole white sequence after this is desperation -- this is an overplay and can  never work.  White should take the simple 1 point sente with M7.]
;B[lm];W[mm];B[lk]C[This should have been played elsewhere -- White's O7 wasn't sente.]
;W[kl]C[If you HAVE to respond to this, play G5 to remove a possible cutting point without  costing yourself territory.]

at L9.];B[kk];W[mk];B[ql];W[oj]C[You can ignore this as well.];B[mj];W[nj]

white choose to capture instead of playing E2.];W[eq]C[

;W[pn];B[fg]C[Is this invasion any good?  It was just a toying move. i think I'm  ahead, but it turns out to work, but should it have?

Yes, this invasion does work, but not, as you played it.  White's shape
here is awful, with cutting points all over the place.  I'll show a proper

sequence as a variation on white's next move.  In general -- when you see a mess like

this look for a sequence of ataris which end up in, a double atari, a situation where

the other player can't connect due to shortage of liberties, or a situation where you  create an internal cutting group with more liberties than a cut of piece.


As it stands, black is ahead by about 8 on the board before starting this sequence.]
;W[ff]C[Unfortunately, white has no good response here.  His best HOPE is to give up the G13/G14

stones -- He probably has to do so by coverring one of the cuts along southern part

of his wall.  This is where white's horrible shape comes back to haunt him.  Variation

1 demonstrates the haunting.  White's best bet is probably the simple connection at E11.

Black then captures, and white has to decide how to contain the black stones.]

(;B[eg];W[dh];B[df];W[de]C[White would be better to play C15 (solid play -- don't allow cutting points or ataris.)

B 15 -- removing black's base on that side is also a reasonable play.  There is no  worry about the cut at E16 -- nor a need to protect it at this point.]

stone, but only one eye), and C17 -- simplify and solidify.];B[be];W[bc]
;B[ee];W[ed]C[D16 for white here is better -- it prevents C17 from being atari, and is sufficient to

kill black.  Black is unable to play E16 himself due to shortage of liberties, and if

black connects at E14 first, white just connects at E16 himself.  If black tries the
cut at C17 anyway -- the simple atari at C18 works fine.];B[cc];W[ef];B
