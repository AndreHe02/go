This is good. But from MY experience only, it is never easy to get points in the center even though you have big walls like this.

Thank you for your comments

Overall pretty close game, eh? :)
B going for center was not a good idea if you ask me. Just for that purpose, B missed a lot of opportunities of attacking to W. The result of the game could be a lot better for B, if he had attacked W when he had the chances _ there were a few of such chances.

I hope the comments/variations were helpful... I might have given too much variations. I hope this does not cause confusion...

Enjoy...])
