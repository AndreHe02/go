Hello Harimau,

Thank you for sending your game to me for review.  The way I write reviews is to play through the game and write the comments as I see them, and then play through it again with the benefit of hindsight.  I find the comments on the second review are better but I think the first review is important because it shows more what I'm thinking about.

Kind regards,

White should not have allowed this kakari.  I personally prefer the low approach but that is more a matter of style.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn]C[--
I would have gone directly to D10 instead because I am afraid white will not play F3 next.  If you take D10 and white takes D6 then the joseki will give you sente to take K16 which will put you in a strong position.]

I would play P17 here to keep white confined.  If white can add another stone at say Q18 then that group becomes strong]

Attaching twice is not necessary, a move like B11 means you have fewer stones that you need to look after]

This is not necessary, I would just play F10.];W[dh];B[cg]C[--
This is premature, you should prevent white escaping before worrying about eyespace.  White has G12 and there is no room for two eyes around C13 anyway.]

This seems more complicated then necessary.  I do not think the attack on the three white stones justifies giving up the corner.]

I have put a triangle on all the places I think are important.

In the actual game you got R18, G2, O2 and N5 while your opponent got H17, Q12, P9, S5.  I think this is the key issue]

I think you got ahead early on.  Then you let your opponent catch up in late chuban and overtake you through yose.  So there are two different ways you could have won this game

1) You could have prevented your opponent catching up in early yose so a dozen points lost in late yose would not affect the outcome.
2) You could improve your late yose so that you narrowly won this game.

In terms of the late midgame, much of this stemmed from how you handle white's Q9 (move 54) and how you reduce / invade the lower side.
The yose improvements are all around counting and small improvements.  For instance H17 is bigger than R18, S5 is huge, missing O13 cost you sente, and F6 is gote.]
