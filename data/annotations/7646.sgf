C[Hi Reviewer,
Here I have a game from OGS that I lost on time due to a chaotic life (became father, and that shaked my time schedule a lot :) )

I don't know my current strengh but I guess I am around 1-2 kyu (when I have time to focues)

I play white in this game against Stoker, whom I don't know.

I am mostly interested in white's mistakes, so I am able to focus more on my weak spots. As every kyu player I count points way to seldom.

Please feel free to comment anything you like. I have comment somehting that I have found during my own short analyse. Please check so my ideas is not totally wrong...

C[while, I don't have any direct opion where my wall should be directing at, I played tenuki.

Chris: The idea of A is to tenuki anyway. as the shape is very stable. I am not sure about the direction of this move.]

Chris: since A is low, i dont like this direction of play. White A is low, and undercut on top. The right side is not so interesting.]

Well, as you see the game is far from over, but I guess it is a rather close game still.

Chris: There is only small endgame left, but the game is still not clear to me. I count B+2 or so.

It seems like you need to play less locally when attacking, and making sure to stop attacking when there is no more profit to be made. In order to put a group under pressure, it is often best not to play hane (and generally not attach) as it helps the opponent make shape. Leaning attacks may be worth studying for you.]

Like this, white can wait for a mistake to catch up, as there is aji around A. In the bottom left corner, running with the 2 stones would not be a good idea, as by attacking, black would make his moyo deeper. White also has a lot of cash on the right now!]
