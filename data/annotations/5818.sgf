C[Dear Reviewer.
Thank you in advance for taking the time to review our game. I played white and from the begining I was behind. I could't find the proper way how to reduced his advantage. Could you help me and point (stress) my (and my oponent also) the main misteakes, slow moves, taking the wrong directions etc.
Thank you
Marek

[DP OK, here we go. You could make life easier for yourself by playing standard approach moves in the opening.  Since you didn't you were forced to play late into the moyo, and created a weak group around N17 which you didn't defend.  This became the source of a lot of your problems. You played some strange moves on the first line (e.g. move 64) in the late middle game which lost you a lot of ground too - you need to erase these from your memory!  Hope this helps\]]

;B[iq]C[[DP All very correct so far - the first real choice of the game comes on the next move\]]

(;W[pj]C[[DP How about attacking at E16?  Q10 allows B to play the low chinese opening at J17, which is notoriously complicated.  In general, when there's a stone which isn't symmetrically placed, like at the 4,3 point, then it is better to attack that stone. See the variation\]]
;B[ic]
(;W[df]C[[DP This doesn't do what you want. You need to be attacking.  The standard low kakari at E17 is still playable. This just encourages B to build his moyo.  Think what a likely answer to your move will be before you play it. Also this leaves B13 or B14 open, so B can slip under your stones later and erase any territory there\]]
;B[ee]C[[DP A good shoulder hit, expanding the B moyo\]]
(;W[cj]C[[DP OK, it's still a bit early, but let's look at territory.
B: 50 point moyo up top, 10 points bottom left
W: 15 points left (still open at B13), 10 points bottom right
So, W is miles behind - need to be playing for influence, not 3rd line territory moves. Alternatives would be E14 as the correct answer to the shoulder hit, or a simple kakari at R14\]]
;B[qg]C[[DP B has noticed you are afraid of his moyo so simply plays to expand it\]]

(;W[mc]C[[DP This is a timid move.  It opens you up to attack without a specific objective in mind.  I would rather see R17, a definite invasion of the corner, or R5 to shore up the bottom right with a shimari.  Even the standard kakari at O17 would at least allow you a better extension\]]
;B[oc]C[[DP B now secures his corner and those 50 points are rapidly becoming reality.  W in exchange has gained a weak group under attack...\]]
;W[kc];B[ie]C[[DP Very correct from B\]]
(;W[qn]C[[DP This is a critical juncture.  You have a weak group up top.  You must secure it as your most urgent move.  At a more advanced level, omitting to defend this group will cost you the game\]]
;B[mp]C[[DP Luckily for W, B ignores his opportunity up top\]]

(;W[nq]C[[DP Note again you should be defending up top. If you want to attack underneath here, do it properly with N2 (and note also you are open to the same moves at B13 abd S10). The move you play here is very small and invites B to play the perfect response at N3\]]
;B[mq]C[[DP A very correct answer, securing B territory and showing how small the W move was\]]

(;W[ri]C[[DP Good, this secures this area.  But remember you have left B13 area open still, and the best move would still be to defend the N17 stones\]]
;B[eg]
(;W[cg]C[[DP This is timid.  Fighting spirit demands you go straight through the gap. At the very least play D13 rather than conceding like this, but E14 should be your first instinct\]]
;B[kf]C[[DP Ouch...B has finally woken up to the power he has up here\]]
;W[me];B[mg];W[je]
(;B[jf];W[jd];B[id];W[jb];B[ib]
(;W[jc]C[[DP Truly horrible. To create 2 empty triangles in one go is a feat bordering on insanity.  With a good shape move like M16 you could have lived here.\]]

(;B[fn]C[[DP B should actually kill the top W group at this point. But this move expands his moyo anyhow, so still gains something.  See the variation for the kill\]]
;W[oh];B[of]C[[DP Good, keeping W separated\]];W[oe];B[pe];W[pf]

(;B[qf]C[[DP Bad, very bad.  Allows W to link up and get out of his mess.  This would be a game-losing move at a more advanced level\]]
;W[nf]C[[DP  Good.  A bad B move is only bad if W takes advantage, which you do here.  Suddenly you are less than 100 points down...  when you realise just how desparate the situation was before this, you will be stronger than 10k\]]
;B[ng];W[og];B[oo]C[[DP The corner is strong, but you have nothing in the centre and are behind in territory.  So you MUST play into the centre here to get influence, and try to reduce a B moyo at the same time. N10 is the best of the options you thought of\]]

(;W[pp]C[[DP Small and horrible. What is the danger? See the variation from N10\]]
;B[mj]C[[DP B regains his huge advantage. He has 30 points top left, 20 point top right, and a moyo worth another 30 at the bottom.  W has maybe 20 along the left side and another 20 on the right, putting him about 40 points behind in territory and B still has the centre moyo as well\]]

(;W[ek];B[gl];W[ef]C[[DP This is better than it looks, creating cutting points in the B shape\]]
;B[ff]
(;W[eh]C[[DP Having created cutting points, guess what you should be doing?  Yep, cutting!\]]
;B[fh];W[dh];B[ok];W[pk];B[ol];W[gj]C[[DP Good.  Last chance saloon\]]
;B[ik]C[[DP Now is a good time to play all the double-sente endgame moves. Check the variation\]]

(;W[ns]C[[DP This is truly horrible when you still have moves like H11 available to eat away at that moyo\]]
;B[mr]C[[DP Luckily for you B doesn't simply just play H11 which would be game over\]]
;W[ms];B[lr];W[na]C[[DP Wherever you learnt these moves from, forget them.  Consign them to the deepest circles of the abyss! The first line is not for playing on except in emergencies and the later parts of the end game.\]]
