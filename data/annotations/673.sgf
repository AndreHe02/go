(Mitaka 1k*)];W[dd];B[dp];W[oq];B[qf]C[HOSHI-SHIMARI          The starpoint is not designed to make that kind of pseudo-shimari.          The aim of the star point is to extend first along the sides.]
;W[gc]C[HOSHI-SHIMARI AGAIN          It looks contagious...          Same remark: with the star-point, the side before the corner.          So, White 6 shoud be at K17.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn]C[MOVE AHEAD          The standard move for Black 11 is to jump ahead of the White stones at R7.]
;W[pm];B[qm]C[MOVE AHEAD AGAIN          Again, the standard move for Black 13 would be to jump at R8.          This way of playing (as in the game) is a special strategy to get sente and play first at  J3. It should only be played in special situations (not here).]
;W[pk]C[ NOBI IS MORE SOLID          White is already ahead so he can simply extend (nobi) at Q8.    
    
It would be more solid.];B[pl]C[GOOD MOVE          Inserting a Black stone here is good, it will create two cutting points]
;W[ol];B[ql];W[fq]C[CONNECT IN THE CENTER          White should connect at P9.]
;B[kq]C[DANGEROUS FOR BLACK         Invading the bottom side is tempting but can be dangerous for the moment.          Cutting in the center at P9 is also a very good move for Black.          I would play solidly keima at C6, aiming either to invade at J4 or cut at P9.          The invasion at Black 19 is prematurate and too close to White strength.]
;W[iq]C[GOOD FOR WHITE          With this move, White stabilises his group and attacks by pushing Black towards his strength.          White can now dictate the flow of the game, Black has no more the time to cut at P9.]
;B[ko];W[mp]C[TOO SLOW          Purely defensive, slow and overconcentrated.          White should play boshi at L7.]
;B[lp]C[ALIEN MOVE          Why play this move ?     White should answer it (nobi at N5).    
This would not be a good exchange for Black.    
    
Black 23 is an alien move.];W[ok]C[BETTER TO ANSWER          If White answers Black 23 at N5 (nobi), Black has no time to cut at P9 yet.]
;B[mq]C[BLACK IS ALIVE          After this move Black cannot be strongly attacked.]
;W[np];B[qk]C[BETTER TO JUMP          Again it is locally better to jump at R10.           Strategically it is not urgent to play here. A White move here would be big but not sente.          Black should try to reinforce his central group by attacking the right white group.        bO7,wP7,bM8,wR9,bR2,wR12,bE3,wF4,bD6...]
;W[io]C[BAD DIRECTION          Better to play in the center at L7 to defend the right white group.          wL7,bJ5,wF5, bD6,wF7...]
;B[km];W[im]C[BAD DIRECTION AGAIN          White is pushing Black toward his weak group.]
;B[in]C[CUTTING A TOBI ...          ...is nearly always bad.          You need plenty of stones nearby to cut successfully a one space jump.          Black should simply jump at L9. This makes the right white group fall in Black shade.          Black 31 is an alien move.]
;W[hn];B[jn];W[cn]C[BIG BUT...        for White 34 I would play at L9. There are here two weak groups, White must seize the initiative by attacking first.]
;B[co]C[TOO EARLY TO LIVE        Living here is very painful for Black, he has to reinforce White and he lives with gote.    White would need two more moves to kill cleanly the Black stone.    It is better for Black to play elsewhere.        Black should first seize the initiative by attacking on the right      then take a big point elsewhere.        bO7,wP7,bN9... then bC11.]
;W[dn];B[dq]C[PAINFUL FOR BLACK];W[dj];B[ho];W[go]C[ATARI IS BAD          Black can counteratari at H7 and capture one stone in the center.          White can give up one stone on the side but not one in the center.          White should simply back up at G6.]
;B[hp]C[MiSSED OPPORTUNITY          Black should give up this stone and take the one in the center.          This would be very good for him. This would make the black group alive and this would destroy the potential of the left side moyo.]
;W[ip]C[MISSED AGAIN          White should connect at G6.];B[gp]
C[MISSED AGAIN          Black should atari at H7 and capture one stone in the center.]
;W[fp];B[gn]C[DOUBLE ATARI          Which stone to defend ?          If White makes the good choice he wins the game, if not he loses.]
;W[fo]C[LOST GAME     (but White managed to win by half a point anyway)    
    
If White connects at H7 he keeps Black separated and captures some Black stones.    
    
wH7,bF5,wE5,bE4,wG7,bF7,wG3,bF6,wH3,bG5,wF8,bE7,wD8.];B[hm]
C[CATASTROPHE          Now Black is strong in the center.];W[gq]
C[NOT NECESSARY        White should now defend his right group by playing N7.]
;B[hq]C[GOTE          Stupid, not necessary and gote.];W[hr]
;B[hn];W[jr]C[NOT NECESSARY          Play elsewere.        Defend your right group by playing N7.]
;B[dl]C[WHAT IS HE DOING ?          Black can win easily if he takes the initiative on the right then invade the left side.          bO7,wP7,bN9...then bC12.]
;W[cl]C[WHITE CAN CONNECT          With this move White connects easily his stones.]
;B[dk]C[AJI KESHI        This move is not necessary for Black and reinforces White.]
;W[ck];B[cf]C[IMPOSSIBLE        Having played 55 at D9, Black must now play 57 at E10.]
;W[ce];B[ci]C[BAD STYLE        Black must play nobi at D14.]
;W[cj];B[di]C[BAD STYLE AGAIN        This way of playing is "helping the opponent to separate my stones".   
This is very bad for Black.];W[ei];B[dg];W[be]C[CAN BE AT E12]
;B[eh]C[PUSHING FROM BEHIND ...        ...is not good.        Better at F13.]
;W[fi];B[fh]C[PUSHING FROM BEHIND    AGAIN        Better at G13]
;W[gi];B[gh]C[AGAIN        Better at H13];W[hi];B[hk]C[NO        Now Black should play at J13.]
;W[hh]C[GOOD MOVE];B[gf]C[HANE        Black can hane at H13, so he should.]
;W[ic]C[MISSED        THE big shape point is H13.];B[hg]C[GOOD FOR BLACK        Now the Black group is secure.]
;W[qc]C[INVADING THE KEIMA        This is not a good idea.    This is gote and reinforces Black outside, usually one prefers to give the corner by approaching it from outside.          wO17,bQ18,wM16.        Another good idea is to make the right White group alive by playing N7.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc];W[rd]
C[WHITE HAS GAINED NOTHING        White has made a 6 point territory where Black could have made 15 points. But he has given Black very good influence and initiative. So Black will recover with the next move.]
;B[kc];W[ld]C[OVERPLAY        Too close to Black thickness.]
;B[kd];W[lf];B[kf]C[BETTER AT L13.];W[nf]C[ALIEN MOVE        White 92 should be hane at L13 (or nobi at M13)]
;B[pj]C[STUPID        Nobi at L13 (or hane at M13).];W[ph]C[OVERPLAY        Here Black is strong and White is weak, so White cannot attack, just escape.]
;B[qh]C[SUBMISSIVE        Black shoud counterattack by separating at P10. This way he can for sure kill one of the two White groups.]
;W[oj]C[WHITE CONNECTS TWO WEAK GROUPS.];B[pi];W[oi];B[pg]C[NOT NECESSARY        Better at L13.]
;W[lc]C[OVERPLAY        Better at L13.        Why separate the two Black groups, White cannot expect to attack.]
;B[le];W[me];B[ke];W[md];B[mg];W[lg];B[ng];W[mh];B[oh];W[mf]
;B[kg]C[BLACK SHOULD CUT        Cut at M12 and try to kill one of the two White groups.]
;W[nh];B[og];W[kh]C[WHITE CONNECT        phew !];B[jh];W[ji]
;B[ki];W[lh];B[ii];W[jj];B[ij];W[ih];B[jg];W[hj]C[BAD STYLE        Do not play atari. This is sente so you will play here when you need it and only if you need it.]
;B[ik];W[kj];B[bn];W[bm];B[bp]C[WHY ?        Better at B5.]
;W[er];B[dr];W[qr]C[DANGEROUS        Black can play F9 in sente then cut at E6 and kill the left group.]
;B[qq]C[NOT GOOD];W[pr]C[WHY ?        Do not be impressed, play at S2.]
;B[rr];W[fl]C[GOOD          Defends against a Black cut at E6 and aims at killing the Black group.]
;B[em];W[en];B[fm];W[ek];B[gl];W[ig];B[if];W[he];B[hf];W[bg]
;B[cg];W[bi];B[bh];W[bj]C[LOSE POINTS        Better to play atari at A12 and connect at B14.]
;B[bf];W[jb];B[kb];W[ed]C[VERY PRUDENT        If you fear something, play at F15, this should be OK.]
;B[lb];W[rs];B[rq];W[ll];B[mn];W[nm];B[kk];W[lk];B[jk];W[lj]

;B[eq];W[gr];B[ao];W[am];B[mm];W[ml];B[oe]C[SMALL 1.25 points        Difficult to calculate.    2.5 points gote-gote.        Better at K19]

A Gote-Gote move is worth half than a Sente-Gote move.



And a Ko Move would be worth a third.];B[ag];W[ai];B[df];W[sr]
C[VERY SMALL        One third of a point, difficult to calculate.        Here you give back the game to Black.]
;B[sq];W[qs];B[ss];W[os];B[sr]C[VERY SMALL        One third of a point.    (One point in ko)

   
If Black plays first H1 and D15 that are worth one point each, then connects here, he wins the game by half a point.]

C[OK: ONE POINT];W[ee]C[OK: ONE POINT        One point reverse sente.]
;B[eg]C[DAME        Worth 0 point.      But it's ok there is nothing left.]
;W[fj];B[el];W[ej];B[gk]C[White was lucky to win this game.



After losing the first fight   (White 46) the game was  
lost.



Black continued to play badly.



>From White 88 to White 114, This was overplay.

White risk was maximal.



By move 126, White had recovered.



During the very small endgame (1 point yose) Black made more little mistakes than White and eventually lost.



3 moves before the end of the game (Black 249), Black could still win.



Even if one doesn't know precisely how to count the value of a move. Everybody should be aware than even in the very small endgame all moves are not necessarilly worth the same.]
