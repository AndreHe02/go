l198741520: Black
Cheshyr: White

This was played on an IGS server.  Both players are unranked, and had under 10 games logged under their aliases.  I believe I am about 22k.

The game lasted about 3 hours.  This was my first game of Go that lasted this long.  I believe my opponent was slightly more skilled than I, and definitely had more patience than I.  Around move 210, I started to get impatient.  When his invasion succeeded, I resigned.

The game itself started with my opponents advantage.  I managed to make some risky invasions, and took the lead.  My opponent then struck back, and took back the lead.

I have played Go off-and-on for a few years, but I only started playing on a 19x19 this week.  I've studied a lot of problems, and read a few books, but haven't dug into Joseki and Fuseki heavily.

I'm looking for any advise on how to improve my game... both in a local sense, and in an overall sense.  What are the little mistakes I'm making, and how can I improve them?  Where should I focus my attention when studying to improve my overall game?

Thanks again for your time.

Cheshyr

Me: Hi!  For clarity's sake, I will mark all my comments with a "Me:" at the beginning.  I'll sum up the game at the end.]
;B[pp];W[dd]C[Cheshyr: The game started with standard Star Point openings.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[jp];W[jd];B[dj]
(;W[pj]C[Me: This fuseki (though playable) tends to favor black, because a follow-through at tengen gives black a much larger moyo.  I would advise moving in a little more aggressively, maybe moving in with an approach instead of Q10.  See variations for explanation.]
(;B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[cb]C[Cheshyr: I haven't memorized any Fuseki yet, so i did not know how to capitalize on what appeared to be a deviation.

Me: a lot of people play this against me too, (7 kyu), and i have found that it isnt particularly sente.  I usually tenuki, and that might be a nice idea in this case.  See Variations for possibilities.]

(;B[bc];W[cd];B[fd];W[bd];B[ab]C[Me: This is an okay wall for you, and you shouldn't feel too bad about it.  However, you need to capitalize on it by moving further out, not up.  C11.]
(;W[ef];B[hd]
(;W[gb]C[Me: Defend your moyo (see variation).];B[ic];W[id]

;B[ga];W[fa];B[ea];W[ja];B[ff];W[dh];B[eh]C[Cheshyr: At this point, I felt I could at least make life on this edge.  He had strong influence below this group, so I did not intend to push downwards with this group.  This may have been a mistake given the success of my future invasion of that corner.

Me: This is okay given that you do invade the corner, but a better opponent will defend that corner earlier.  Ensure that you get to invade before he defends, and you're good.  Tenuki, however, is a bad idea because if he begins the fight, he can gain on the left.  Start the fight for life or start an invasion.]
;W[if];B[ch];W[dg];B[di];W[bh];B[bi];W[bg];B[eg];W[ih]C[Cheshyr: This move was supposed to be a ladder breaker for the cut I would make at F13.  when he saw through it, I wasn't sure how to proceed.  I felt there must be a way to take advantage of the cutting points in his groups, but I couldn't find a way to use them.

Me: Two things: 1. Never assume your opponent will make a mistake.  Thats a newbie move and will get you in a lot of trouble.  2. He actually isn't weak here.  The upper right corner is alive, and the left side is strong because of black influence.  Cutting, though possible, will cause no real harm to him.  However, you could have used this for white moyo on the center-left.]
;B[hf];W[fg];B[ee];W[df];B[hg];W[hh];B[fh];W[gh];B[gg];W[ge]
C[Me: This is useless, and you should know it.  Read out basic moves like this and your go games will get exponentially better.]
;B[he];W[ei]C[Cheshyr: 66-70 are wasted moves on my part.  I saw the ladder, but didn't think through it entirely.  These stones did become a point of contention later, but not in the way I'd hoped.

Me: Proverb I learned was this: Every move in a broken ladder is worth 7 points.  Don't make moves like that.]

(;B[gi]C[Cheshyr: I was unpleasantly surprised that he didn't play 87 at K12.  I thought the cutting point I left there would be attractive for cutting me off from the center of the board, and I could contrinue to attack the group surrounding G15.  Turns out, he had better foresight than I did.]
(;W[qq]C[Cheshyr: When my attack on the group surrounding G15 fell through, I started making safe invasions on the 3-3 points in his corners. I chose R3 first since I had help at Q10.

Me: Not your fault, but I hope you do know the 3-3 by heart.  Its in the variation.

Also, don't play the invasion now.  See the variation of the correct 3-3 for why this can be devastating.  Instead, kakari at R6.  See Variation.]
(;B[np];W[qp];B[pn];W[qo];B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[nq]C[Me: Dont keep pushing.  He got a big moyo because of it.  Invade instead.]
;W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[ql];W[po];B[oo];W[rl];B[pk];W[qj];B[nk]
;W[qk];B[pl];W[ni]C[Cheshyr: With the side successfully invaded, I decided to attempt to secure the upper right corner for myself, and then launch another invasion.]
;B[nj];W[oi];B[li];W[cq]C[Cheshyr: In retrospect, thos should have been at M12, to block him from moving in.  Fortunately, he was more bothered by the corner invasion.

Me: Good sight, but actually the invasion is probably more pressing.  2 reasons.
1. 3-3 invasions almost 100% leave with you still having control.  That means that you can play this with only one worry, that being the wall he gets in return
2: Cut at M12 is bit, but if you play there, he gets to protect the invasion, which means he gets a huge territory.]

;B[cl]C[Cheshyr: At the time, his move at C8 felt very clever.  It neatly blocked me from attempting to attack his group at D10.]
;W[bm];B[dm]C[Cheshyr: 128-130 are more wasted moves. I think I was trying to push into the open center, in hopes I could save them later.

Me: Learn the ladder breaker.]
(;W[fk];B[fl];W[gk];B[hk];W[lh]C[Cheshyr: 18 stones too late, but I still got the spot.]

;B[kh];W[hj]C[Cheshyr: This was another attempt to push into the center and help my trapped stones.]
;B[kf]C[Me: Use your gains.  Variation.]
(;W[lf];B[mh];W[kg];B[lh];W[nf];B[jh];W[kf];B[ij];W[mj]C[Cheshyr: Here I was trying to scare his group at M10, in hopes that I could push into the center more.]
;B[lk];W[jk];B[ik];W[mk];B[mm];W[ml];B[ll];W[nl]
(;B[nm]C[Cheshyr: This move should have been at P8.  I remember holding my breath and hoping he wouldn't see it.  I got lucky.

Me: P8 is useless.  see variation.
Maybe P9, but even that is questionable.];W[ok];B[ol];W[oj]
;B[nn];W[lm]C[Cheshyr: This cut, and it's following moves, are the boldest, stupidest thing I did the entire game.  On all accounts, every stone I play for the next few moves should have died.]
;B[ln];W[km];B[jl];W[jm];B[gl]C[Cheshyr: My opponent finally gets tired of me trying to save the stones in the ladder.  At this point, I change my plan, and try to make life in the center.

Me: Very little chance of life in the center.  Protect yourself from the 3-3 first.  Alternatively, reduce.  Variations.]

;W[ap]C[Cheshyr: Not sure why I'm still playing in this corner.

Me: This is a whole lotta luck.];B[cg];W[af]C[Cheshyr: Time to make sure these guys stay alive.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[fe];W[il]C[Cheshyr: Last ditch attempt at threatening the stones at M8. He doesn't fall for it.]
;B[jj];W[ir]C[Cheshyr: Push out a little, grab another eye, just to be safe.]
;B[gq];W[hr];B[lq];W[jr];B[kr];W[ks];B[ls];W[js];B[mr];W[qc]
C[Cheshyr: I think this move is good and bad.  I remembered the success I previusly had with my 3-3 invasions, and I wanted to prevent it.  However, I think this move made him realize he had a chance at reducing my territory with an invasion.  Either that, or he just hadn't gotten around to it yet.

Me: Never avoid making a move so he doesn't see something.  He'll see it eventually, and it will make you lose.  This is good.]
;B[an];W[aq]C[Cheshyr: Wrong move.  Group is already alive.  Should have played at B6.]
;B[bn];W[as];B[am];W[br];B[bl];W[os];B[ns];W[ps];B[ld]C[Cheshyr: Here's where things get ugly.  I knew I'd left plenty of weaknesses in this wide open area, but I couldn't seem to play smart when it came to defending it.  At this exact moment, I think I'm up abot 50 points.  The next few moves make us even.

Me: You have a lot in that area.  Just protect.]
(;W[md];B[me]C[Cheshyr: As soon as he played here, I know he was going to try to kill the group at L15.  Instead of just connecting, I let him lead me arond, and eventually succeed.]

;W[od]C[Cheshyr: I go for a quick threat on his groups at M16, and N15. He sees through it.]
;B[qf];W[oe];B[le];W[qe];B[ri]C[Cheshyr: Now I get worried.  I can see how he could make a living group, but can't think of a way to kill it.

Me: The best way to kill is to reduce.]

;W[sl];B[sm];W[qi];B[si];W[sd];B[sf];W[ph]C[Me: Something just happened with my sgf editor, and it deleted your lost comments.  I'll put them here.  This game was okay, but you overcomplicated situations a couple of times, and other times you didn't think enough.  The most obvious move is often best, but make sure there isn't an equally obvious reason its bad.  Never extend ladders unless you read them.  Your local play is your weakspot, but your whole-game understanding is good for your rank.
