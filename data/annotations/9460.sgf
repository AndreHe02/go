C[This is the game I played in Harbin (China) with a 40-years old korean student. I plyed white. My rating on DGS is around 19-20 ku, on KGS about 17 ku. It's been around half a year since the last time I played on KGS. The reason is the internet connection quality in the internetional students dormetry. It's beyond bad. So I can't say what would be my rating on KGS now. My opponent's level doesn't seem to be much higher. We played with 4,5 komy as he asked.
The game is important for me, as this is the first time I tryed to get into the center. previously I used to play on the side and lost most of the time.
I would like you to define my present level and the level of my opponent, tell me about all mistekes we,ve made. At the end of the game I've lost 0,5 point . Was my stratage wrong from the very beginning, or did I lose because of some stupid mistakes?]

[qm:B]C[P: White's move at "A" is too big to ignore.  The group formed by B is tenuous at best, inviting an invasion in the northeast corner.]

(;W[cj]C[P:  I'm not sure a three-point extension is the way to go here, you're loosely spread out on the third line, and black can take advantage here.  See variations]

(;B[qp]SQ[fc][nc][gd][md][qf][pg][cm][dm][cn][dn][fp][gp][mp]
[np][fq][gq][nq]C[P:  Remember that attaching also strengthens the stone you're attaching to.  There are higher urgency points on the board to play.]
;W[qq];B[rp];W[po]
(;B[rq]C[P:  This is a move you save for later in the game.  The life or death of a few points in the corner isn't as important as keeping your groups alive and connecting them together.]
;W[qr];B[ce]C[P:  Again, attaching strengthens white here.]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[pm];B[ql];W[pl];B[mk];W[qn];B[rn];W[mm];B[kl]
;W[km];B[hl];W[qk]C[At this point I found it right to switch my attack to the side. I thout if I could reach R13 it would give me an opportunity to devide his groups, pearcing the center. It would also give me  potential opportunity to invade in N16- N17. At this point a fond it better not to answer The attack at H8. What do you think of my descision?


P:  An Invasion at N16 or Q13 is long overdue, and doesn't really depend on the fight going on at the southeast corner.   Preventing black from linking up is good,, black's grasp for the center doesn't have a solid foundation.  You've kept sente (initiative) well in a few spots up until here, the trick is leveraging that initiative into playing more urgent points on the board.]
;B[rk];W[qj];B[rj];W[qi];B[pk];W[pi]
(;B[ok]C[P:  Black should never make this shape.  See variations]

(;W[pf]TR[qf]C[P:  In this situation I think playing the third line is stable.  Not as active towards the center, but Black's next move is pretty strong.]
;B[qf];W[qg];B[rf];W[rg];B[pe]C[P:  Now black has the corner pretty solidly, and you've got nowhere to go but the center.  Not very good for your score.]
;W[of]C[I realised my group was vulnerable at S11. Well, at least it would cost me some trouble. But I didn't have time to finish the formation.


P:  Better to not have gotten into this situation in the first place.  Invading on the third line would have saved you a lot of trouble.]
;B[ho];W[hp];B[jo];W[ko];B[jn];W[kn];B[gp];W[hq];B[gq];W[gr]
TR[fc][gc][mc][nc][gd][md][cn][eq]C[P:  This is too low, there are more important places to play right now]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[fr];W[gs]TR[gc][mc][nc][gd][md][cm][dm]C[P:  This is not really needed.  The loss of a few points on the edge is much smaller than the marked points.]
;B[dr]
(;W[ep]C[P:  Corder is always higher urgency than controlling the center.  Don't forget your base!]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[bq];W[bp];B[fo]LB[go:A]C[I fas trying to connect so that I could destroy the black group in the corner. But the last black move made it impossible.

P:  Remember this shape black just made around the point :"A":  Try to see that ahead of time and move there first.]
;W[fp]LB[go:A]C[P:  This doesn't accomplish anything.  Black can automatically connect at "A"]
;B[fq];W[gn];B[go]C[An the last try.];W[mi]C[At this point I found it better to get towards the center, as I thout the left side was not in danger.

P:  There really isn't any territory in the center.  Numerically your score is going to be higher if you control corners and sides (in that order of urgency)]
;B[ip];W[iq];B[io];W[kq];B[fn];W[dm]C[I guess, this was the first big mistake of mine. Now it seems mor reliable to move on D6 instead of D7.


P:  The mistake was not playing here 50-60 moves ago.];B[dn]
;W[cn];B[em];W[dl];B[el];W[ek];B[fk];W[ej];B[df];W[fj];B[ki]
;W[ii];B[ig];W[gg];B[gf]C[P:  While white is fighting for enough room to live in the west, Black is locking up the North easily.]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[dg];B[cg];W[ef];B[bf];W[ee]C[I gave up the stone on C14 to get deeper into the opponents territory.]
;B[dh]C[I didn't expact him to attack like this.

P:  Your group in the west hasn't made life.  Black's strength in the corner guarantees his stones' life, so thrusting into this territory doesn't mean anything if those stones themselves are captured.]
;W[eg];B[bi];W[bj];B[ed];W[eh];B[di];W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[fe]
;W[dj];B[me];W[mf]TR[mc][nc][oc][lk][jl]C[I was to choose between the attack on P15 and blocking on N14. What do you think of the chose I made?

P:  What I like about this move is the correlation formed by the marked stones.  This is a robust way to expand, but the problem is that you aren't surrounding much territory.  If you had a wider base of territory in the east this would be a stronger play.  At the moment I think the marked points are more urgent.]
;B[lf];W[mg];B[ne];W[oe];B[od];W[lg];B[kf]
(;W[jm]C[Maybe L13 wold be better. What do you think?

P:  You are threatening groups that are most likely alive, you need to threaten to cut off stones.]
;B[kh];W[hf];B[he];W[fd]C[P:  This is exactly why we don't like the "dumpling 3" triangle shape.]

(;B[gd];W[ge];B[fc];W[hd]C[I gave him the stone on F 16 to get closer towords the side. If I blocked he would just play H16.

P:  Black made a mistake by such thin diagonal contact, and white punished appropriately.]
;B[gc];W[ie];B[hc]
(;W[kg]C[P:  Here you're just encouraging black to get thicker and stronger.  Save this for later.]
;B[jf];W[kj];B[ll];W[lm];B[nl];W[nm];B[jj];W[ji];B[lj];W[ic]
C[P:  This might be a ko threat, but not a reasonable invasion.]
;B[id];W[lc];B[jc];W[nc]C[P:  This can't live under any normal circumstances.]
;B[oc]C[This is the biggest mistake I've made. I forgot I had no stone on O14. Thus mu stones were doomed.]
;W[nd];B[ld];W[md];B[nb];W[nf]C[Another mistake. A panicked. Maybe I had a small chance If I blocked. But, not likely.]
;B[mc];W[jk];B[kk];W[ij];B[jl];W[kj];B[ik];W[jj];B[li];W[jh]
C[P:  You lost a big opprotunity by letting black's stones in the center link up with the southwest group!]

(;B[gl];W[oq]C[Maybe this was not nessecary.But I descided to finish the form after his passive move.]
;B[he]C[I ignored the stone to attack the black group in the center.]
;W[lh]CR[gk][hk][fl][fm][gm][hm][gn][hn][in]C[P:  Unfortunately black will always be able to run away here.  Look at the marked eyespace:]
;B[nj]C[Now that was a bad move. He ralised it very soon. But he panicked and faild to save the group.]
;W[mj];B[il]C[In my piont of view he hat to take the stone on P10. It would buy him enough time to connect. Should I take his four stones, he would immidiatly take the one at M9. Then he could connet in J8 and finish the connection in M9.

P:  Black should have connected at M9 sooner, clearly.  This was an error in reading on Black's part.]

;B[ss];W[qs];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[Here is where we finished the game. He won 0.5 point. What do you think of the game itself and of our level?How would you rate each of us? I would Appriciate any advise about how I could get my level higher.
Thank you for your help.
