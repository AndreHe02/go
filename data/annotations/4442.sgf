the illusion of a huge side, but it is not at all secure.];W[nq]
;B[np]C[the overall direction of playing O4 seems wrong to me.  Your
territorial potential is toward the bottom; so why would you 
force white to move in that direction?
P3 would force white to run out.];W[mq];B[mp];W[lq];B[kq];W[kr]

;W[qj];B[qk];W[rj];B[rk];W[fr];B[fp];W[hr]C[it's not really necessary for white to keep going after the bottom - black's
potential is well spoiled, the white groupd are safe, and there is not much white
territory at stake.  White should have played elsewhere.];B[fn]

C[white is just piddling away at small gains, while the center lies waiting.
but the same could be said of black - al long as he responds to white's
small attacks, which is getting the better deal.
There is at least 50 points at stake in the center.   H4 threatens
at most a 10 point swing.];B[id];W[gd];B[ie];W[jf];B[mi]C[finally.   It may not work, but it's long overdue.]
;W[me]C[at this point in the game I felt I was winning. N 15 seemed like not much of a threat and didn't take much territory. I didn't know the best move to make so I tried to secure my big center territory so he couldn't take it. Should i have pushed and pressured one of his groups?

White's groups are all pretty solid, and all without too much upside potential,
so going after them directly isn't the best plan.  Going for the big territory is
definitely in order.];B[kl]C[good.  that really should end the dispute.  Something will have to
be given up around the weakness at O10, but black should end up
with most of what he apparently has now.];W[pb];B[qb];W[nb]

;W[fo];B[go];W[gn];B[fm];W[hn];B[io]C[this is really a misplay, but not necessarily a fatal one.  White's invasion
should be hopeless, so black should just gently make it look more so.
This move leaves H5 as a threat.    L4 is the only real cutting point.  My choice
here would be K6 - make it clear that white isn't going anyhere, and give some
protection to L4];W[eh];B[eg];W[fi];B[fg];W[ej];B[dh];W[gj]

defends the other side,  I don't think white can do any damange. (see variation)]

point at n6.  You shouldn't automatically atari just because you can - 
think about the shape that will result.  In this case, an isolated
white stone deep inside your territory is a gift.];W[qm];B[rm]
C[same thing here, better to play s6 and stay connected.  White
has no chance to get away or to live unless he can cut and kill something.
You shouldn't give him the opportuinity  To begin with, just watch out
for adjacent chains of groups all with 2 or 3 liberties.  It's an invitation
for some complicated sequence of ataris to get out of control.]

[ss]C[I would appreciate review very much. Thank you for looking at my game!

I only saw that one major blunder, which clearly changed the outcome, but
before and after the blunder, attention to the big picture was missing.  That's
probably the hardest skill to develop.    I also saw a lot of little tactical things,
which can be fixed pretty easily by just reading one or two moves deeper in
local situations, and comparing the shapes which result from the alternative
choices.])
