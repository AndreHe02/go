C[hi. please review for white.

i felt i misplayed a few moves so would like a strong player's comment on this game.

thank you very much for your review.

>Hi! Thanks for submitting an interesting game!

White played well at the start and got an early lead, but he lost it when he let black get a crucial point at the bottom. Both players failed to make use of their thickness and to attack when they could. It was a quiet game, which makes it even more important to try to find some leverage over your opponent. This means forcing your opponent to invade so you can attack, or invading in order to cut off some of his stones. This is always much better for making territory than just taking big points. There were also a few tactical errors which made quite a big difference.

I hope some of this is useful. If you have any thoughts, questions, or so on, just say hi on KGS (I play as "sixsix") or drop me an email :)

(;W[dk]C[>Good move. The price of tenuki in this joseki is that b can live with B18, so he is stronger; however, H15 has already made him stronger, so this is not much gain for b. Seems like you have a good feel for this.
