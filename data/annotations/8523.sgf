LemursDontExist here!  I'll be reviewing your game.

My comments wil always appear under a divider.  I've done my best to stick to statements I can back up with solid reasoning, but in my enthusiasm I might sometimes overshoot the mark, so take it all with a grain of salt!

I have included some final remarks in the last node.];B[pp]

------------------------------
A play at C6 is critical here!

B5 was an error - usually B plays (A) here to avoid being pressed low.  By playing Tenuki you allow B to correct this error and turn the tables on what should have been your strong group!]
(;W[qd];B[do];W[eo];B[dn]C[------------------------------
Now W's stones are starting to look more like a target than an asset.

W can no longer safely extend very far along the bottom, as we'll see later.  Also, B now has a stronger claim to left side than W does.  W is going to have to add a move or his bottom group can come under severe attack.

B has taken an early lead in the game.]
(;W[cf]MA[eo][eq][dr][dp][ep]LB[kc:A][oc:B][qn:C]C[------------------------------
This is a strange move.  W's marked stones are urgently in need of an extra move or B will be able to cheerfully attack them while taking profit.

Even ignoring the lower left, the knight's move from the 4-4 point is rarely correct.  The corner is still open to invasion, and after an invasion, W's stone will be too close to the corner to accomplish much.  

Even if the invasion never materializes, W will eventually have to spend another move to secure the corner properly.

W's move feels motivated by fear of letting B play the ideal extension/kakari.  It's true that a move at C14 would be very nice for B, but you can't play simply to prevent B from making a good move.

W should consider plays like (A), (B), or (C) instead to expand his moyo.  I like (A) here (a chinese fuseki) since it prepares you well for B's expected play of C14.]
(;B[oc]LB[nc:A][od:B]C[------------------------------
B also misses the critical situation in the lower left.

Locally (A) or (B) would be more common here since the pincer is so effective.]

Saving 3 stones isn't important, and W can't kill B.  W should be content to presure B from the outside and use the aji of the three stones to gain thickness.

Now B is connected, alive, and out in the open, while W has only saved a handful of points.

------------------------------
This result was good for W.  

The stones W sacrificed were a liability, so in playing this sequence you've exchanged bad stones for good stones.  If B had really wanted to capture the 7 W stones he should have done it without actually playing out the ladder.

Doing a quick count, B has about 34 solid points (the squared points and his captures), while W has about 35 (the circled points, his captures, and 6 points komi).

B's potential territory on the right side is small given all the cutting points and W's ladder stones should give him a strong advantage on the undecided portions of the board.  At this point, the game has turned solidly in W's favor.

W should defend his weak stones at the bottom, and see what B does.]
(;W[nd]C[------------------------------
This move is aji-keshi.  W is better served playing from the other side, or better yet, not playing locally at all.]
;B[nf];W[nb];B[na];W[nc];B[oa];W[ma];B[la];W[pa];B[ma]
(;W[gd]LB[gb:A]C[------------------------------
This move isn't as big as it may seem.  B can still play at (A).    With all of B's cutting points, W's stones aren't in danger of a serious attack.

At this point in the game a move like this is very small, and W is giving up many larger oportunities to make this play in gote.]
;B[pj];W[ni]C[------------------------------
While it is sente, this sequence is small and unecessary - W should be quite content if B wastes a move here now, and later W might be very thankful for the ko threat, or might prefer another sequence altogether.]
;B[oj];W[mh];B[lg];W[mm]LB[ci:B][hp:A]C[------------------------------
This move lacks a clear purpose.  W isn't taking any territory, securing any groups, or threatening in any serious way B's stones.  B has many cutting points and it isn't clear yet which one will be most profitable to attack.  Each individual stone is easily sacrificed.

W should settle his group along the bottom with (A), or make an extension along the left side (possibly to (B)) taking points.  Depending on B's answer, W can then decide on the most profitable cut to try.  If B takes time to connect up his ladder stones, W can happily gobble up the remaining territory and win easily.]
;B[nn];W[ll];B[lo]C[------------------------------
And now B is much harder to attack.  W has gained very little from his cut.]
;W[jq]MA[eo][eq][dr][dp][ep]SQ[lo][pp][nm][nn][on][pn]LB[hp:A]
[pq:B]C[------------------------------
This move is terrible!

As B's response shows, it is too far from the marked W stones to reliably connect.  The move seems aimed at undermining B's squared stones, but this is a somewhat vague plan.  For the purpose of reinforcing the marked stones, (A) would work much better, and if the intention is to undermine B's group W really should start at (B) to secure his weak corner group.

While it is always good to make moves that serve multiple purposes, the move has to *actually* achieve both puposes to be useful.  A move that merely hopes to do two things, but does neither well is generally worse than a solid single purpose move.]

Excellent!  This point is huge since both B and W could extend along this side now and take territory.  W still has a chance in this game if he can turn a good portion of the upper left into territory.  Because B played out the ladder W might just have enough influence to pull it off.]
;B[ck];W[dk];B[cj];W[dj];B[fm];W[gk]C[------------------------------

The game goes well for W from here on, and W handles an invasion of his corner skillfully.  However, with this play B has secured enough points that I don't see W making up the difference.

This was a fun game to review.

W was at a disadvantage early on thanks to the tenuki from the lower left corner, but after the ladder had been played out, the game turned in W's favor, despite the sacrifice of 10 stones.  This game is a good example of why you shouldn't play a ladder out!

I have two comments of a general nature.

First, W made several moves without a clear purpose (e.g. 20, 128, and 132).  Each move you make that doesn't achieve any purpose is like giving up a handicap stone, and each move you make with no definite plan has a good chance of achieving no purpose.  The stronger your opponent, the more surely those moves will cause a loss.

Second, W made several fairly small plays (e.g. 64, 122, and 208).  If you make a 5 point play when there are 15 point plays on the board, you sacrifice 10 points.  The difference between a 1 dan and a 4k is about 4 plays like that a game!

The simple discipline of having a clear plan in mind for each move is worth many stones of strength and makes the game more enjoyable for both players.  Your plans won't always work of course, but mere hope and intuition turn the game into a gamble!

Thank you for the opportunity to review this game, and let me know if you have any questions!]

------------------------------
I would say that at this point, for the sake of consistency, W should be ready to sacrifice the marked stones.

W has already passed up his best chances to settle these stones, and B still needs a few moves to capture them outright.  If W wanted to take time to protect these stones he should have done it earlier.

W should now be looking for ways to either secure these stones incidentally to a more important objective, or to sacrifice them at a profit.]

While it is painful, I have a hard time coming up with a better play for W.

After this move, W has lost a little ground, but can play with a clear conscience on the rest of the board.  W shouldn't be surprised to have to add a move here - it is the natural price W pays for getting to play the marked stone.]
))
(;W[cn]LB[bn:A]C[------------------------------
After C6, B is pressed very low, and is taking less than 10 points with no real prospect for improvement. 

W, by contrast, has  a large wall and is positioned to try to make territory along the bottom, or later to seal B in with (A) if the left side becomes valuable.

This result is very similar to what would have happened if B had invaded at the 3-3 point - always a bad idea this early in the game.]
