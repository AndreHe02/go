C[Hi, I'm SadSido, 12k Go player from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. I will review this game for White and make some comments aboud Black's most strange moves =)

The opening of the game was won by Black, who used his stones effectively, while White had no clear game plan. Afterwards the players exchanged solid territories and tried some desperate invasions (and even suceeded there), leaving the game almost even. My last comment is at move 162, where White has missed an important cut.

In general, I have the following advices for White:

- learn the meaning of the stones, you play at the opening. The opening is always an experiment, but there are some basic concepts, you should use to find your game.

- estimate who is ahead and who is behind. The player, who is ahead must play solid moves and look for exchange. The player who is behind must look for a fight, making some ambitious and risky moves. Please note, that White player starts from behind, until he has a komi.

-don't follow your opponent blindly. Before answering to *every* opponent's move, ask yourself "Can I leave this situation and play elsewhere?". Sometimes you cannot - your opponent forces you. But sometimes you can and you should always give it a try (or at least a thought =) ).

Enjoy your game! Hope, you like the review!];B[pc];W[dd];B[dq]
;W[pp]C[[SadSido\] White plays 4-4 stones, that are very flexible an can be a source of either influence or territory. Black plays 3-4 stones, which are oriented on territory rather than on influence.]
;B[pn];W[np];B[qi]
(;W[nd]C[Better in D5  O17 or D10?

[SadSido\] I would prefer D5 here, because it applies some pressure on the lonely D3 stone. 

D10 seems too quiet for me, and it gives black the initiative. I wouldn't play O17 as well, because it will let black develop his left side framework.]
;B[oe]
(;W[kd]C[[SadSido\] I think O15 is better here. Building some kind of a wall, facing the 4-4 stone is a good idea.

L16 move neither brings you territory (because it is too high), nor prevents black from developing his stones.]
(;B[nc];W[mc];B[nb];W[mb];B[iq]
(;W[lq]C[[SadSido\] M3 is too tight. You should prevent black from building a corner enclosure. No need to worry about your O4-Q4 stones - they seem safe now.

When you have stones on the 4th line, you cannot expect them to bring territory. Use them to corrupt your opponent's territory instead (for example, consider Q8 move, supported by your stones in the corner)]
;B[dk];W[di]C[D13 or invade at D7 ?

[SadSido\] At this moment, you can see that your opening game went wrong. Black's stones are definitly better. All the white stones are played on the 4th line, two corners are isolated from each other. The stones does not support each other much.

The main strategy for now is corrupting the game for Black. Black has the lead and will make solid moves. White must try risky moves to gain initiative.

Possible moves are invasion at D7 with the idea to run away to the center (and NOT to live on the side), invasion at Q8, cutting Q6 stone from the main black forces, maybe Q15, followed by the cut at P16..]
;B[hl]
(;W[gi]C[[SadSido\] Chasing black will only give him stable territory. You may think that it gives you the territory as well, but keep in mind that black leads for now and black is happy for any exchange.]
;B[kl]
(;W[ii]C[[SadSido\] One more time, you are following black's game, instead of playing your own. White must take the risk.]
;B[mi];W[kh]C[[SadSido\] Black is too tight now, and he is totally connected. Not much left for white in this game]
;B[mf];W[kf];B[mn];W[qo];B[qn]C[[SadSido\] Black is happy to exchange territory. White must find some way of challenging black's territory instead of gaining his own.

There are still some desperate invasions (with not much chance, but the opponents are 20k, why not give it a try =) ). Consider C8, K4 or K5. 

Also note, that black has a killing move at C17, after which white has nothing but to surrender. White must protect against this move.]
(;W[ro]C[[SadSido\] Here it is ok, because of sente. Black sees the threat of monkey jump (at T8) and must protect by playing S6.]
(;B[sn]C[[SadSido\] ??? No excuse for this move. Why not S6? =)]
;W[rn];B[rm]
(;W[sm]C[??? T5

[SadSido\] No move required at all here! White should switch his attention elsewhere (still at C8, or K4, or break through O6)]
(;B[sl]C[[SadSido\] Black really wastes time here. He has enormeous borders to protect and he is challenging white for 3-5 points. Just render white off by 3-3 invasion.]
;W[so]C[[SadSido\] No need for this move either. You protect 2 points, while you are behind by 30 points. You must search for a fight with black.]
;B[sm];W[jq]C[[SadSido\] White's focus is correct, but the move is too territorial. This move triggers exchange of territories, not the fight.]
;B[jp];W[jr];B[ir];W[kp];B[jo];W[ko];B[kn];W[mo]C[[SadSido\] White cannot be happy of this. N5 is not necessary, because black has sente now and has some victorious moves to play. C17 (lethal), C11 or E11 (challenging), C10 or P16 (quiet).]
;B[nn]C[[SadSido\] Too small even for Black. P5 would bring more challenge for example, threatening White... C10 is quiet and simple]
;W[ln];B[lm]
(;W[lo]C[[SadSido\] No challenge here. Black forces white's every move. White must take more risk (see the variation)]
;B[fl]C[[SadSido\] What move does black afraid of? Why not F9? Or even more ambitious F10?]
;W[kj];B[ci]C[[SadSido\] Good. Black finally sees its move]
;W[ch];B[bi];W[bh];B[ah];W[ag];B[ai];W[bg];B[cj]C[[SadSido\] Why not D10]

I must connected before !!

[SadSido\] Not here, I beleive. You still have to fight.];W[ei]
;B[dg]
(;W[cg]C[C14 ?

[SadSido\] C14 or B15 are ok. C13 brings white down. But as far as I estimate the score, White has lost anyway, even if black fails the invasion.

As an answer to the question at the last move, the invasion at C3 is always possible. Why not give it a try? The chances are low, but black can make a mistake and let white live. It is only up to you to decide whether to test your opponent or to give up (I prefer giving up, though, but it is a matter of personal attitude =) )
