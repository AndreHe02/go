Hi. Thank you for reviewing.

I played black. I don't know my proper ranking.
Since I haven't played much on servers I hurried sometimes without proper reading, because I feared I didn't have enough time.

I fear I sometimes just answered the moves of white to be sure of a position, instead of playing elsewhere important.
Are there white moves I should have ignored to play bigger moves elsewhere?

Any bad moves I didn't see?

other questions see later.

Hello,

first of all: in my opinion, you should *not* play against a weak robot like that. Please use stronger ones (GnuGo based, probably), and adjust the strength difference by handicap stones or komi. 
The reason is: You will
(a) be confronted with really silly moves, *no* human player (even weak players) will play
(b) not be confronted with "typical moves" (i.e. moves that are played a lot in certain situations, which is something you should learn about) 
(c) annoy the reviewer, if he/she is confronted with too many of these games. ;-)

My Comments are marked by "H"];B[pd];W[qf];B[nc]C[H: good continuation]
;W[og];B[pp]LB[og:A]C[H: Good move. white A is strange, as whites territory is open from below.]
;W[oe];B[qd];W[pk];B[dd]LB[qn:A][cp:C][dp:B][dq:D]C[H: A good choice, I'd say. The other possibilities are A, preventing w from extending further, or the lower left corner.]
;W[pn];B[nq]TR[qn][rn][qo][ro][qp][rp]C[H: Good extension. But note, that the corner is still not save, until a stone is played near the marked points]
;W[cj]C[H: You will never see that in a real game. Remember that the usual sequence is corner - side - center.]
;B[dq]LB[cf:B][cp:A]C[I mostly played the hoshi point because I'm unsure about the effects of the beginning moves. And the direction to play.

H: There's nothing wrong with the hoshis, but you must be aware, that they aim at outside influence, which a more difficult tactics than going for territory.

In this case (playing 3-4) , I would have preferred A, as black's corner is now open for attacks coming from white above.
An extension at B (leaving one of the four corners to white) would be a good move, too.]
;W[fc];B[cf];W[qo];B[qp];W[co]LB[dq:A]C[H: While this is a common approach to black A, the space between the two whites is too big. Black should make use of this (see next move)]
;B[gp]LB[co:B][fp:A]C[H: Nothing wrong, here, But A would have been a stronger connection, and a good basis for attacking B.]
;W[nm];B[jc]LB[lc:A]C[H: One step too far. Now, white can attack by splitting at A]

[am][bm][om][pm][qm][rm][sm][an][bn][qn][rn][sn][ao][bo]C[H: The corners are quite stable, as is much of the sides. Let's count potential territory.

Black:
15 in the upper left corner (playing around E will be neccessary to be save, here)
15 in upper right
15 in lower right
8 in lower left
which makes 53 in total. 
If the area around A and B would count as well, it would be around 25 points more.

White:
31 on the right side
and potentially (when playing C or D) 10 on the left
which sums up to 41.

Black leads by 10 points (25 more are quite possible)


See the variation for more analysis on this situation.];B[mo]
TR[lg][kj]C[H: This move does not really help black. Neither in making territory, nor by reducing white's.

If white is able to extend his territory (marked stones), he could get 15-20 points. Black should prevent that.]

B would have been another good move.];W[ro];B[rp];W[kh];B[me]
