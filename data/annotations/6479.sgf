AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi thanks for review,  I am not particualry strong so I am none too sure about handicap games and as with this one tend to lose them if my opponent does not make a major mistake  I notice

cesare1>> Hi. The right attitude in handicap games it's play active stones and try to keep sente during the match.]
;W[nq]C[I figured to try a 3-3 invasion on each corner woudl be a silly thing to do so I done this with the aim of expanding left

>>If Black answers correctly at 3-3 Invasion in handicap games  gains a strong influence at centre. White o3 it's Ok]
;B[or]C[I was not too sure how to answer this Iwas thinking o2 but this seemed too slow to me

>>Black with this move try to close the corner with a unconventional kakari.]
;W[kq]C[> This is an excellent answer.];B[jq]C[>> this is another strange move. Usually play a contact stone help the opponent to get strong shape.]
;W[jp];B[ip]C[this is a solid way to play.];W[jo];B[iq];W[qf]

;W[lo]
(;B[mr]LB[nd:A][pf:B][qh:C]C[Here is when I started wondering when woudl be an oppurtunity to go back to the r14 stone, I felt I could not ignore here the bottom though

>> Yes Black could play A B or C, or something else in the top right corner. I show some possible Joseki.]
;W[lr]C[>> White it's very strong after the capture of the 2 stones. He has to play tenuki (elsewhere).]
;B[jr]C[kenjiro43 [19k\]: ?

;B[ns];W[mq];B[ms]
(;W[qd]C[I thought now is my chance to swap up to the top, since black did not defend here I though I could try to slip under it

>> Finally White play tenuki ! You can invade directly in 3-3, or try a double approach in o17 (or o16).]
;B[qc];W[pi]C[I figured here is worth more than s16

>>another good move of white.];B[qk]C[NOt sure if this by black had to be answered

>>Black have a big weakness in the bottom, maybe he has to play nearer this corner...]

(;W[pe];B[oe];W[od]C[>> this cut is strange. I'm not sure it's a bad move, but i think that if you cut p15, you have to continue the action in o16]
;B[pc]
(;W[dm]C[Trying the same attack each time would case issues I thought and I had to stop black buildign up around here, so on the d line I figured was ok since I can go left or to the centre without too much difficulty

It's a good moment to observe the situation. there is a critic situation in the top. If W play first in the corner can gain the points to take the lead.]
