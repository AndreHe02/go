C[This is a league match I played today in the fifth German Bundesliga.
I am black and it is an even game with 7 komi.
The game ended with a big blunder on my part, because I was short on time, but it was quite close before that.

I am looking for a review of the whole game, because there were interesting situations in all stages of the game. Reviewing from black's point of view should be enough. I've left some comments, questions and variations.

Thank you for your time!



COMMENT: Hi. It was an interesting game. I hope comments are useful. good luck]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[oc];W[nq]C[Should I pincer here? I wasn't sure which side was preferable.

C: you played well. white is helping you develop right side which is ideal for you.]
;B[pn]LB[qn:A]TR[ce][de]C[C: I would think about A instead so you can end with sente and play triangle area]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[lp];B[qj];W[ci]LB[gd:D][cq:A][fq:C][jq:B]C[This also seemed strange to me. I played the 3-3 invasion on A, but I also considered B, C and D.

Comment: This was an important moment take a look and variations and comments.

D is a better idea. it expands your framework and limits white's. 

I like C or B more than A.]
(;B[cq]LB[jq:A]TR[ci][lp]C[C: this is too early. white marked stones become very efficient. also, the very attractive point at A becomes harder to play]

[de:A]C[I didn't expect white to ignore my approach, but the move seems to be big.

Comment: this is surprising. interesting idea for white. but exchanging A for B first would be better i think.]

(;B[dd]LB[de:A]TR[jd]C[C: important moment --

usually this is played when white has a stone around triangle... it is a way to settle your shape so you aren't attacked severely. so i wouldn't play this way.

playing at A seems more natural... it pushes whtie into the corner and reduces whites center.]

(;W[fd]TR[bd][cd][be]C[After the game I looked up the joseki on josekipedia.com:
F16 seems not to be joseki as it allows me to capture the marked stones, but is there any move that I can play in sente first to become stronger on the outside? F15 and G17 didn't seem to be sente.

C: killing it is not easy. profit while attacking it. make him live small. in the game he got 10 points with this group... thats too much.

Check out the variations... i threw in some ideas for attacking at different points...]

If white protects Triangle group you get to walk into moyo while pressuring Squares.

Comment: It is playable for black if you like fighting games. white's shape is still weak in the bottom right and your stones in the center will make invasion of left side easy, while white's stones in the center are not as useful]
