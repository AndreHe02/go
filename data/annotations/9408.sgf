AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi Sandra,
i´m your reviewer DaVince (3 Kyu) on Kgs.
If you have any questions just contact me!];W[dc]C[I think you started of very solid and with a good concept! BUT in my opinion you make planes during the game and then you play some moves with this plan in your head AND then you change... This leads to an incosequent strategy. If you keep on plan the outcome will be better!]
;B[qq]TB[mf];W[nc]C[me [?\]: hi];B[qf];W[cn];B[fq];W[bp];B[cq]
;W[pb];B[qc]C[Black (me) looks overconcentrated and the sides can easily be split by W. The advantage of the three stones already looks eroded.

DaVince: Maybe you are a bit overconcentrated BUT every of your groups is very stable and you should not fear an invasion(it will always come). You should think about geting the most profit out of it!]
;W[qg]LB[pg:a][rf:b][rg:c]C[This move looks very slack to me and defenetly suprised you! If you get suprised just take a deep breath and try to figure out whats going on! 

You don´t have to read every move out! but you should get some feeling what will happen!

So i try to analys this positon a bit:
-You are worried about your top group!
-You want to attack that lonely stone
-You want to gain profit on the bottom/right side

So look my varation wich trys to get all 3 goals with easy moves!]

(;B[pg]C[This hane:
-Leaves cuttingpoints which make your top group weaker
-Presses white in the direction he wants to play!];W[qh]
(;B[ph];W[rf];B[qe];W[qi];B[qb];W[re];B[rd];W[qn]
(;B[ng]C[This was a misclick. See branch from 21 node.];W[kc]
LB[en:a][ce:b][kp:c]C[Now you beginn with moves that have one plan but with the next moves you change that previous plan!

Your goals:
-Get points at the bottom!
-Invade the left side!

Moves I would play:
A: Build moyo but then stick to moyo strategy
B: Attack left side
C: safe Bottom(slow)]
(;B[en]LB[ck:a][on:b]C[This move forces White A but your bottom side is still open!
So you lost the chance to invade the left side AND you did not gain profit on the bottom.

I would consider your move when you try to build a moyo but then a move like B should follow(But very risky here because the bottom area is so wide open)]
;W[ck]
(;B[de]LB[en:a][de:b]C[This is what i meant with inconsecent strategy A and B don´t work well together!]
;W[ce]C[Maybe you should look up this josiki.
Hane is the normal answer!]
(;B[df]MA[dd][ec][eb]C[When you extend your goal is to build a wall]
;W[cf]LB[ii:a][dd:b]
(;B[ii]C[This move doesn´t give you anything...
And it´s too early. 
Your borders are open and the bottom side is to large. So you don´t secure your moyo with this move.]

(;W[dg];B[ff];W[fc];B[on];W[kq]LB[qk:a][mq:b][iq:c][ko:d]C[You could invade now at the right side this is the right moment!]

(;B[mq];W[hq]LB[ho:a]C[Such an invasion i not easy to deal with...
But you have to keep the presure up and don´t give away stones easily]

(;B[hn]LB[ho:a]C[A better.
With 38 you don´t pressure enough, white has an easy live...]
;W[io]
(;B[ho];W[in]
(;B[ip]C[To play this hane and then sacrify this stone makes white alive and the invasion a total success!]
;W[hp]
(;B[im];W[jp];B[jn]C[Ah, now I remember why I played that weird 42 stone, I had this in mind, to get a few outside moves in sente. But I leave cutting points.]
;W[jo]
(;B[jm];W[hm];B[fo];W[hl];B[ko];W[lq];B[lo];W[mr]C[This was an unexpected move and my response feels like a mistake.]
;B[nr]C[White can grab a stone in more or less sente]
(;W[mp]C[Weird direction, though--after my mistake at move 56, I'd expect to white to cut and atari.]
;B[lr]C[...and all the unexpected moves trigger a bonehead mistake from me. The psychology of go is the hardest part-- to focus, to not make blunders like this.]
;W[nq];B[mo];W[or];B[jk];W[pl]C[Big point for white--could I have afforded to play near there? Where?

When White made the invasion!

After this the game is over for you. 
You don´t have any terretory and white has too much!];B[ol]
C[Looks wrong to me; in hindsight, wish I had just capped. The thinking was that white would strengthen their wall and I would strengthen mine.]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[om]C[Ouch! Unexpected for black];B[nl];W[nm]
;B[pj]C[Black (me) wants to keep all three of these split groups alive... Asking for too much?]
;W[ml];B[nk];W[mk];B[nj];W[pn]C[I am united, but so is white, and "my" area has been invaded. Terrible for B]

;W[ns];B[ql]CR[re][rf][qg][qh][qi]C[The loss of a big group often makes me forget about "whole board thinking" and lead me into moves like this. This looks like a "premature endgame" to me.

This is a heavy attack against the right group!!!];W[pm]SQ[ri]
[rh][rg][rk][qj][sj]LB[rj:a]C[After this exchange why not attack the right group?

It´s wide open and still has to make two eyes!]
(;B[bq]C[So does this, but I thought I was in risk of dying here.

No i don´t think you are in a risk of dying here];W[qj]C[I abandon my "premature endgame" stone; I wish I hadn't. Even if the timing of it was wrong, it doesn't deserve to die I feel.]

Some key moves wchis lost you the game where.

-A the tennuki at the top left corner for a stone that had no real effekt.

-B the hane and then sacrify it.

-C Not attacking the right group where you had the chance(2 times).]
