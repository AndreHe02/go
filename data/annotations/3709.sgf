Hello, I'm Antoine from France, ~12k.
よろしくお願いします。

My comments wil begin with [A\].

I wrote comments during all the game as they came to my mind with some variations.
I also included a short global comment on the last move. Be sure to check it !

Please, feel free to contact me by e-mail if you have any questions about this review !]

(;W[pj]LB[oq:A]C[[A\]
It is a good idea to play at this point because black would be very happy to have a stone around there, which would work very well with both Q16 and Q5-Q6.
Nevertheless, this is a bit dangerous. One would usually protect the corner first (see variation). You can get into trouble after Black playing A.]
;B[ql]C[[A\]
Good. Black quietly makes a life basis for his group.];W[pg]
LB[nq:A]C[[A\]
An important Go proverb to keep in mind during fuseki :
Always play urgent moves before big moves.

Here, playing A to protect the corner is the urgent move.];B[mq]
C[[A\]
Nice from Black who takes profit out of your mistake.];W[jd]
LB[or:A][qr:B]C[[A\]
Once more, K16 is a big move, but protecting the lower righ corner (A or maybe B) is urgent.
I think Black can kill that corner now.];B[mc];W[gd];B[cf];W[jp]
;B[kq]TR[gd][jd][pg][pj][dp][jp]C[[A\]
One thing is obvious when you look at this board position : you played many high stones (eg one the 4th line).
So far those stones are not really making any solid territory while Black managed to make territory basis in two corners and two sides. So you are clearly behind on strictly territorial consideration.

Stones on the fourth line are a compromise between territory and influence. They are not really making territory, but they have more central influence for building a big moyo or central fighting in middle game.

This a possible but more difficult way of playing.];W[ci];B[cl]
;W[cm]LB[cn:A]C[[A\]
Contact moves (tsuke) are generally not a good way to attack because they strenghten your opponent's stones.
'A' would have been better.];B[dl];W[jq]TR[cl][dl]C[[A\]
This is big but slow.
I think it is more important to go on attacking the marked group.]
;B[jr];W[ir];B[kr];W[hq];B[cq]C[[A\]
Nice. The 3-3 point is the weakness of the 4-4 stone.]

I think the right direction of play is A (see variation)];B[cp]

Yes, this position can lead to complicated variations.
If he plays ok, Back will live in the corner.]
(;B[ap]LB[do:A]C[[A\]
Black might also cut at A (better I think). See variation.]

Useless. There is no danger there.];B[em];W[en]LB[ei:A]C[[A\]
Small move.
It is very important to run to the center with A instead.];B[fm]
;W[fn]LB[ei:A]C[[A\]
Same thing. A is urgent.];B[ei]C[[A\]
Very big for Black.];W[gm];B[fl];W[kp];B[lp];W[qd];B[qc];W[rd]
C[[A\]
R15 is slightly better];B[pe];W[qe]TR[qd][rd]C[[A\]
Another thing to keep in mind : Empty triangles (the marked shape) are almost always bad shape.
This is the reason why R15 would have been better than S16.]

[A\]
White is not so bad but I think Black is ahead because of the left side.
One thing is sure : you need the lower right group to live in order to win. So you need to add a move to protect it (A or B)]

[A\]
White didn't have much territory to claim in the center anyway.
I repeat myself but it is still very urgent to protect the lower right corner.
A, B, C, D, E are big moves.];W[ol];B[mk]TR[ol]C[[A\]

;B[np]LB[ki:A][nm:B]C[[A\]
Bad move ! Black could have cut at 'A' !
There is no danger around O4 anyway since Black can cut the two white stones at B.]

I still prefer A or B. But this can be complicated.];B[nq];W[qk]
;B[rk];W[rj];B[rl]

Small ! There's no need to protect here. (see variation)
Anyway Q8 would have been better (remember the empty triangle ?)]
;B[ro];W[qm]C[[A\]
White MUST answer in the lower right. Now Black can kill for sure (and that's what happens in the game).]

Looks more like a desperate attempt to invade ;-)

Good
(is it ncesary to remind you that the most important area is still in the lower right ?)]
;B[qb];W[rb];B[qa];W[oo]C[[A\]
This is an awful move because :
1- it doesn't bring you any point
2- it forces Black to play a good move (Q4 definitely kills the corner)
3- it wastes a potential ko threat];B[pp]C[[A\]
I can't see a way for White to live now. But maybe there is one...

[A\]
Big mistake !
Black can capture either triangle stones or square stones, and there's nothing you can do about it.]
;B[ho]SQ[gl][gm][hm][hn]C[[A\]
The best choice for White is to sacrifice the four marked stones. (see variation)]

A is the only move !];B[fp]C[[A\]
Nice game ! Unfortunately Black played a bit better.

It is hard to give some you general advice... I would say :

1. In the opening, play urgent moves before big ones even if they are much more tempting ;-)

2. Do not follow your opponent into a sequence of useless moves. You should always consider the global board position and ask to yourself : where is the more urgent or the biggest move ?

3. Seems obvious : try to read deeper... You lost many points just because of misreading (lower right and bottom). To improve your reading, try to solve life and death problems, to learn and read some tesuji.

etc...

Hope the review is helpful, it was a pleasure for me to do it.]

The triangle point is not very big. By playing it White can claim a little territory around K7, but Black won't have anything around G11...
