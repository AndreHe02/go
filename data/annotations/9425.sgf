C[[untitled\] -I won this game because white made a big mistake at the end, but otherwise I have done most of the game behind in my opinion.

I couldn't invade the lower side efficiently and in a timely manner, and couldn't compensate that loss by keeping my big moyos I tried to build throughout the game.

Thanks for the comment. Looking forward to it.
Feel free to contact me in-game on KGS if you feel like it.

Hello, I am your reviewer, BGA 3kyu, so that doesn't mean I understand everything.  See what works for you.

I have marked a few variations 'var'

See moves 17 and 82 for the high cost of letting the opponent burst through a gap in your wall.

See moves 35 and 133 for the cost of starting to fight, then backing down when opponent makes a fairly obvious reply]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[fd]
(;B[dc]C[[untitled\] - Not sure this response is good here. I wasn't sure how to respond so ended up closing the corner to save some territority.
-----------------------------------------------

The idea of your 'Chinese' fuseki - the 3 initial stones at the top - is to invite white to invade, then attack with a knight's move at D14, building territory on one or both sides.

It's three against one - you should be thinking of attcking, not defending.  Territory will come naturally as oppo struggles for eyes or runs out on dame points.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[df]
(;B[cf]C["Don't push from behind" says the proverb.  In such a pushing contest you want to get in front of the opponent as soon as possible. The question of when you can jump is determined by any cutting points in your shape.  See var]
;W[he]
(;B[ld]TR[kd][dg]C[[untitled\] - Too passive maybe ? I was worried of a pincer against j17
-------------------------------------------------
 Black is stronger round here and if you play the key point at D13 to block white, J17 should be able to cope.  But if you are worried then maybe a point closer at L17 puts a little more pressure on white and stops him pressing you as he did next.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[kd]
(;B[le]TR[ld][jc][ic]C[This is an expensive mistake.  Blocking at L17 is natural and right

You have a wall with a hole in it.  White should push through and the two black strings are seriously weakened.]

(;W[ie];B[dj]C[Not sure about this.  D13 or C6 are simple and obvious, but I see you have planned your next move]
;W[ch];B[cn];W[cl]C[Instead of responding immediaetely, you can lean on the corner first  See var]

(;B[dl];W[cm];B[dm];W[ck];B[dk];W[cj];B[di];W[ci]
(;B[dn]C[[untitled\] - I wasn't sure about connecting here as white would likely close the corner as a result.
-------------------------------------------
You need to connect to stop the C6 stone from being cut off (unless your plan is to grab the corner territory which I don't think is a great idea as the D7-D11 wall would end up looking rather pointless with live white walls all around).

But there's a better way to connect, see var.];W[cp];B[fp]C[Maybe F3 to threaten W territory and eyespace?]
;W[fq]
(;B[ep]C[A 'thank you move'.  It merely solidifies white and takes away a black liberty.  see var]
;W[eq]
(;B[gq]C[... before you hane, think whether you can cope with a cut.  Maybe you can but it gets messy.  Anyway the point is to decide first

either to take on the fight or to simply play G4 instead.

Fighting (G3) then backing off (G5) when the opponent makes an obvious move, gets the worst of both worlds.]
;W[gp]C[ouch]
(;B[go];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip]
(;B[fo]C[If your wall was bigger you wouldn't need to defend this cut. Besides you have invested a lot of stones and given White some 25-30 points solid profit so you need to make this wall work and not just get 10 points in the middle.  See var]
;W[dh];B[hi];W[qf];B[pi]SQ[ho][hi][le]C[Good.  Your pincer works well with the marked stones and builds a moyo.  Whether it's exactly the right pincer is above my pay grade but it's the right idea.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc]MA[qf]C[Your 51 is correct when the marked white stone is not present, but here it's unsupportable.  Not everyone knows the refutation at white S17 but unfortunately this White did.]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[od];B[oe]C[No choice; lose three stones or one :-(]
;W[nd];B[pf]C[correct];W[ob];B[nc]C[oops];W[mc];B[ne];W[md]
LB[pn:B][qk:W]TR[le][ld]MA[io]C[Now the corner is settled, it's time to take stock.

Tip : Except when you are in the middle of a big life or death fight, you should always be thinking of what you plan to do when you get sente.  [This is a really good use of the time when your opponent is thinking\]. This will often guide your thoughts in the smaller skirmishes as to whether you play for profit or concede a bit in order to take the initiative elsewhere.  Or indeed on which side of the fight you take or concede profit.

In this case you should be conscious that the future of the game rests on the big open spaces in the lower right.  You want to build your moyo and reduce white's, especially as you have a head start with some power in the centre.

You really really want to come out of this with sente and get someting like 'B' before White gets 'W'.  X is also a nice point to have some time soon.

In this context the triangled stones aren't that important as they simply separate two white groups that are already strong.

OK, F18 is quite big for either side (15-20 points for white at the top), but even then, if you get 'B' will White ignore it?  I don't think so.

Given your existing strength in the centre, it is better to expand your own moyo than to invade white's bottom side

Please keep these thoughts in mind as we proceed.];B[lc];W[me]
;B[mf];W[nb];B[lf];W[kc]C[Now you have reduced white a little and got a useful stone at M14, the top is less big than it was before.  

Time to start a different fight];B[gb];W[lb];B[fc];W[ed];B[ec]
TR[np][qn][pn][io]C[This is now very small.  Time to switch and White should not have answered you.

If you already had in your mind the idea of where to go when you got sente, I don't think you would have played here.

I am hungry for any of the marked points];W[gd]
(;B[jg]TR[ki][kh]MA[ih]C[Useful in a way but not the best spot as there is a hole at X. In these circumstances it's better to play further away from the opponent's strength say one of the marked points.

Anyway, Q6 is still a better direction.   

When both players have a moyo, a play at the boundary of both is always huge.]
;W[hg]C[See var]
(;B[gh]C[defends the left centre, but the future of the game is elsewhere.

That's the trouble with having territory; it costs you to defend it, see hypothetical variation for white]

(;W[ih]
(;B[jh]C[the next few moves are painful for black.  It's just not possible to defend both sides; you defend one side and push the enemy into your other side.

So : decide carefully which side matters most - then don't play so close.]
;W[ii];B[ji];W[jj]
(;B[pn]SQ[jg][jh][ji][hi][gh]C[This is a big point ,well spotted but it's a bit too late.

White bursts through the gap in your marked stones, rendering them fairly useless

See continuation for white (which would in practice come a bit later)]

(;W[qn];B[qm];W[qo];B[pm];W[np]
(;B[nn]C[You can afford to stretch one more.  This is important as white can ignore your O6  whereas N6 would be hard to ignore.

(;B[kj]C[Phew!  W could have taken this earlier];W[jk];B[kk]
;W[im]C[Now you actually have to worry about eyes for the group in which you  invested so much  (by letting white have the edge territory)]
;B[hl];W[hm];B[gm];W[gl]
(;B[gk]TR[hl]C[Inconsistent.

Either atari from F8, giving up the marked stone but defending territory in sente 

Or play where you did, then try to capture the white stone, see variation]
;W[fl]

C[good escape!];B[jm];W[il];B[in];W[fm]TR[dn][fo]C[You are connected so alive.  The players shouldn't be fighting over this one stone.

If black is uncertain about the marked connection, then go for D5, which has the bonus of creating a weak point in white's position.
These little things do add up!  There's normally more than one way to connect.]
;B[fn];W[gn];B[oo];W[op]C[Now we are into yose the biggest points are often on the edge. Especially you want to look for those that are double sente.

It really pays to spend half a minute to scan the edges and make your choices.

T17 4 points big sente for white, small sente for black.
B13 6 points double sente unless anything is bigger
S6 10 points gote for black. NB S7 is more or less sente for White]
