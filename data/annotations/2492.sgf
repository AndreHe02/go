;B[pe];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[pk]C[X: Manchurian fuseki is my favorite opening..]
;W[lq]C[X: This was a strange move.  Usually, opponents play D10 or Q17 at this point.  I wasn't quite sure how to respond.]
;B[iq]C[X: The thinking behind this play was that if he did something with his M3 stone, I could play F3, making a two-line extension and a kakari on the D4 stone at the same time.  If he played e.g. C6, I could slide at D2, end in sente because of J3, and then attack the M3 stone.If he played a counter-pincer at e.g. G3, I could jump out, and then attack M3.]
;W[po]C[X: This is not at all what I expected.  I think G3 would be much better for White.]
;B[qo]C[X: White can't play the usual joseki (hane and connect) because Q9 is in a good place, and M3 doesn't prevent Black from making nice shape at O3.

roge: O3 seems not too bad (separate the white stones: a good idea)]
;W[pp]C[X: So I probably should have realized that I was forcing him into the small avalanche, which is a joseki that I don't know.  I really should study it...]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[pn];W[qq];B[pr]C[X: I thought about forcing a capture with S3 and then stretching up at P6, but decided I'd take the corner, hoping to keep the White stones weak.  If they were to become strong by capturing Q3, J3 would start to look lonely.However, seeing the result of this, I figure it was too good for White.  I figure this is probably my first big mistake of the game.  How could I have played better?]
;W[rq];B[or];W[nq];B[rp];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[sq];W[rm];B[rr]
C[X: The redeeming feature about this is that Q9 is in a great place, so that White can't capture Q6 in a ladder.]
;W[qj]C[X: So he decides to attack Q9 and Q6 together.];B[oo]
C[X: I had to make a choice between attacking the stones on the right or the stones on the bottom.  I decided that the ones on the bottom were more urgent, because attacking them helps J3.

roge: Maybe it's not a good idea to play atari, maybe later ?

roge: I prefer Black F3 to take a base for life];W[op];B[on]
;W[ln]C[X: Nice move, but I figured I could cut.

roge: White play light moves and black three stones group get heavy]
;B[mo];W[lo];B[mp];W[mq];B[lp];W[kp];B[mn]C[X: All this was to put weaknesses in his formation.  I figured cutting immediately would be a bad mistake.  See variation.]
;W[pl]C[X: I was expecting M7...];B[ko]C[X: Since White is daring me to cut, I might as well.]
;W[jp];B[jq];W[kq];B[lm]C[X: I figured my group was weaker than his though, so rather than pulling out the cutting stone, I decided to just use it for forcing moves to strengthen my weak group in the middle.]
;W[kn];B[km];W[jn];B[ol];W[qk];B[pm];W[pj];B[ql]C[roge: black should have answer the atari, life and influence are in the center]
;W[rl];B[fq]C[X: Middle group looked safe enough for the moment, so it was time to look after the bottom side.  His bottom side group still only has one eye, so if I can strengthen myself on both sides, I can keep up the attack.

roge: yes! very urgent move];W[eq]C[X: Of course White doesn't play submissively at C6.]
;B[fp];W[cn];B[io];W[jo];B[hn]C[X: Continuing to attack the bottom side group...]
;W[jm];B[kk];W[ok];B[pl]C[roge: these too stones are no longer important, Instead of connecting O9 will give you a good shape]
;W[nk]C[roge: isn't it ?];B[nl];W[mk];B[qh]C[X: Middle group can still make two eyes or escape, so I figured I'd take sente.  This was a bad move, though... I wanted to erase the thickness of his right side group and attack it at the same time, but it still has plenty of ways to live, so this isn't severe enough.I think I should have taken a big point e.g. C11 or K16.

roge: Too close to the white thickness, R13 seems stronger]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[qg];B[oh]C[X: Double purpose; jump out and threaten cut at P10]
;W[of]C[X: He keeps up the attack...];B[oj]C[X: So I follow through with the threat to cut.

roge: Q14 seems to be a better idea

roge: playing this move it seems u want to kill an unkillable group, take a glance at the whole board.]
;W[oi];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj];W[nh]C[X: He decides to sacrifice three stones, but...]
;B[og]C[roge: Damesumari !!! (shortage of liberties)];W[ng]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[ph]C[X: The idea here was that I was going to force White S12 so that I could get both S14 and P15 in sente, then extend along the top.  But...]
;W[nf]C[X: He decides to just connect and force me to choose whether to capture O9 group or Q13 group.]
;B[rg]C[X: These seemed more important, because they settle the corner, whereas the center group can live anyway... also , it's four Black stones at stake, instead of just 3.]
;W[lj];B[md]C[X: Should have forced the capture at N8 first to make unconditional life for the center group.  Fortunately, White doesn't capitalize on my mistake.

roge: I don't like this move because it's too closed to the corner and not connected to the corner]
;W[jc];B[ml]C[X: I get to do it anyway.  Phew.

roge: why this move ?];W[mi];B[lc]C[X: I figured this was a solid move, reducing the threat of a corner invasion while threatening an invasion of my own at H17.]
;W[nd]C[X: He decides to invade immediately.];B[nc];W[od];B[pb]
C[X: Trying to preserve connection, but later he separates these groups anyway, so maybe instead of this, I should have played H17.]
;W[je];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce];W[eg];B[db]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[fc]C[X: At this point, I was very scared.  He's got two large moyos to worry about, and I had to figure out how I could deal with both.]
;B[ck]C[X: D9 would be way too good for White, so I have to start with this one.]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[cj];B[ci];W[bj];B[bi];W[di];B[ej];W[bh];B[bk]
;W[ai];B[dl]C[Not too bad, but I end in gote.];W[jh]C[X: He decides to expand the top.  Maybe J13 would be better, since it would make it much harder to invade.]
;B[jd]C[X: A sneaky move.  If he ataris at J16 and I pull back, he's left with two cutting points, so he'll probably defend one, leaving me sente to reduce from another direction.]
;W[kd]C[X: He decides to call my bluff though.];B[id]C[X: Nothing to do now but take up the challenge, because if that area becomes territory, it's game over.]
;W[kc];B[ie];W[jf];B[hg]C[X: Begging him to cut so that I can get some forcing moves.]
;W[if];B[hf];W[he]C[X: He takes the bait.];B[ge];W[hd];B[gd]
;W[hc];B[ff]C[X: Figured he'd let me do this in sente, since I'm threatening a cut.  Then I could jump out to safety.]
;W[hi]C[X: Again, he calls my bluff and says "do your worst."]
;B[df];W[ef];B[ee];W[ec];B[fg];W[fh];B[gh];W[fi];B[gi];W[gj]
C[X: Amarigatachi.];B[eh];W[ei];B[dg];W[ek];B[el];W[fj]C[X: Nice little exchange takes place...]
;B[cm];W[fl];B[fm];W[bm];B[dn];W[co];B[er];W[dr];B[ep];W[dq]
;B[do]C[X: I was happy with that sequence, cause it gets me some territory, that I'm seriously lacking.]
;W[oc]C[X: Now I'm left with the only large potential territory, so he has to prevent me from getting corner territory, or he loses.]
;B[ob];W[qd]C[X: Beautiful move.  See variation for what happens if I cut.]
;B[rd];W[qc];B[qb];W[rc];B[rb];W[sb];B[kb];W[jb];B[lb]C[X: So, I live on both sides, but all my territory is gone.]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[gm];B[gl];W[hm];B[gn];W[in];B[ho];W[ae];B[ad]
;W[af];B[be];W[bg];B[bf];W[ag];B[hl];W[im];B[fk]C[X: This is sente, since he only has one eye.]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[kr];B[ls]C[roge: You forget that the black lower left center group is not still alive ... O7 kill, isn't it ?

roge: so when the white group escape it can kill your group !

roge: so I prefer something like J9 threatening to kill the white group with M1]
;W[jk];B[kj];W[ki];B[jj];W[ik];B[ij];W[hk];B[hj];W[gk];B[fl]
;W[hh];B[gg];W[ig];B[ji];W[ih];B[gc]C[X: Still alive in the middle, just barely.  See variation if he tries to kill.

roge: and what if white L8 and later O7 ?];W[gb];B[ed]C[X: Bad engame move.  The next one is sente, but I should have taken a bigger point first.

roge: F16 better, B8 better, M9 very better];W[me]C[X: Taking this point myself probably would have been better.]
;B[fd]C[X: I get this...

roge: atari H18 before and E19 after seems better];W[hb];B[ea]
C[X: ... and this in sente, though.];W[fb];B[ld]C[X: This is sente, too.]
;W[le];B[fr];W[ka];B[la];W[ja];B[nb];W[re];B[rf];W[sd];B[ds]
;W[cr];B[cs];W[bs];B[es];W[bq];B[bl];W[bn]C[X: Lets me do some serious corner reduction in sente...]
;B[ri]C[X: Reverse sente, so seemed like the biggest thing...]
;W[sn];B[so]C[roge: and why not S5 ?];W[ro];B[qr];W[sp];B[ej]
