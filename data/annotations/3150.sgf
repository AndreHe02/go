C[This is the game I played on KGS with very standard for me mistake. I took invasion at lower right too close to heart and was severely punished. Please show be the way to handle it with smaller losses. Thanks!

I'm Bob - SirBowen (13k) on KGS - I'll be reviewing this game. Though I'm far from an expert, I hope you'll find the comments that I've made helpful. My comments are prefixed by <SB>.

Generally your play was solid for your level. I think this is a good game to get reviewed - if you can improve in the areas that gave you trouble in this game, you'll see your whole game improve.]

;B[kd];W[bc]C[<SB>: In your following comments, you point out the move after this one as the beginning of your troubles.

But before we get there, let me point out a few things about this position...

Right now, you're thinking of the large open area in the center and on the left side as your territory - but this is not territory yet. Actually, White has almost no secure territory at this point. In fact, none of the 3 white chains have even made eyes yet for their very survival!

You may have heard that the moves in the opening part of the game should be balanced between securing territory on one hand, and gaining influence on the other hand. Right now, Black has secured some territory, and White has some strong influence in the form of 3 walls.

That would be fine, except that we're not in the opening anymore - we're into the mid-game and White should be concentrating on turning his influence into some territory of his own.

General Principle: In order to secure territory (and make eyes), the stones in a group must be 1) close enough to support each other and 2) spread out 2-dimensionally - that is, so that they have both length and width.

In this game position, the White stones that are close enough to support each other are pretty much 1-dimensional. There is a sort of 2-dimensional aspect, but only between groups that are too far away from each other.

Specific Suggestion: As an example of how to accomplish this, consider how the board would look if you took this last move and placed it somewhere in the middle of the large open area. That would have really started to bring your 3 chains together and build on the influence that you have.]
;B[kp]C[Ok, I believe this is where my troubles started. I hoped to kill this invasion. Instead I let him slice me apart. I probably should have accepted he'll live.

----------
<SB> Your comment is pretty much on-target.

An area this size is definitely going to be invaded. And when it is, there's pretty much no way to kill it.

To refine this idea a bit, one of the hardest ideas to let go of in Go is that of killing the enemy stones. But I'm assured by much better players than myself that killing should be on your mind at all.

The purpose of attacking enemy stones shouldn't be to kill - there are simply too many ways for them to make life. Rather, we should attack such that our *threat* to kill a group limits the opponent's options and lets us take some other advantage. Only think of killing if you can actually read out the sequence of moves necessary to do so.

Combining this idea with my comment on the previous move: what you have here is actually an opportunity - to create real territory for yourself by limiting the size of Black's resulting group while you simultaneously shore up your other positions on the board.]
;W[hr];B[fr];W[kq]LB[kn:A][jn:B]C[I usually have trouples with invasions. I probably play too close to enemy stones  to stop them. Now when I think --- would responce like white L6  be more appropriate?

----------
<SB>: Once again, your comment pretty much gets at the key issue.

One of the other counter-intuitive principles in Go: Don't touch the weak stones! Touching them generally just makes them stronger.

There are some exceptions to this rule, but it's better to first develop the habit of attacking from a distance, then learn the exceptions later.

I think your suggestion of A is fine. I might prefer B, because 1) it stands more directly in the way between Black's invading stone and the area you want to secure and 2) it provides more support to the group in the lower-left corner, which needs it more.]

;B[jn];W[hn];B[im];W[hl];B[jk]C[dadlib [24k?\]: I just do not know how to stop this kind of encroaching :-)

----------
<SB>: Recapping based on the comments so far, hopefully now you can revew this sequence and see the difference between playing in contact with the invading group and keeping your distance.

Throughout this sequence, whenever you played in contact with his stones it game him the chance to threaten you and force you into a response. This just let him get larger and larger.

When you played at a distance, you had the space you needed to connect your stones and build a containment barrier.

Once again, you have to accept that Black, absent some egregious blunder on his part, is going to make a living group. Your goal is to limit the size of the group and take an advantage in return.]

;W[nn];B[lm];W[jj]LB[ii:A]C[<SB>: Consider this move, for example. If you had played back a bit, at A for instance, Black would not have been able to flow around it, and you would not have had the problem of him breaking through in the center-left area later.]
;B[ik];W[hk];B[ij];W[ji]TR[jj]C[<SB>: I've mentioned 2 things that are hard to get used to in Go. Here's the third: letting go of stones.

Your attempt to save the marked stone is what gave Black the final opening into the left side.

Consider that - in spite of the amount of space that Black has been able to take up with his invading group - if you had used the next several moves to enclose him at a distance and secure the territory you've sketched out, you would still be a little bit ahead! Saving this one stone at this point cost you about 45 points - and the game.]
