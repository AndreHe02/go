RE[W+2.50]

C[This game was played over a period of weeks at a turn by turn server rather than the usual faster games online.

I played black. My opponent is 3kyu.

I'm particularly interested in the huge (50+ point) ko fight  in the middle
game and the end game.

Best wishes

Dear John,

My opinion on amateur games is outspoken and quite different from most amateurs' ideas. IMO, fuseki hardly matters because we make so much mistakes in chuban and yose. Consequently, my comments will focus more on those parts of the game.

Keep in mind that I'm only 1 Dan and that your own ideas areas valuable as mine.

Dieter];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[ce];W[od];B[kc]C[Good move.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[pe];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg]C[Capture the cutting stone is very important.]
;W[rd];B[sf];W[qc];B[pf];W[of];B[og];W[pj]C[This move is pretty close to the Black strength.]
;B[cn]C[No mistakes so far. Myself I would not hesitate to play atari on 18, but maybe this is not too urgent.

In any case, you play far from your and your opponent's strength. Very good.]
;W[dl];B[do]C[I've never seen this move. The ensuing sequence reminds of the joseki with all stones one line lower. Here White is made strong on the fourth line, so that we can consider the points below to be his territory. The result is unbalanced.]
;W[cp];B[fo];W[ep];B[fm]
(;W[fk]LB[gp:a]C[White should play 'a'. See variation.]
(;B[dj]C[Likewise, Black should jump on the opportunity to fence white in in the corner. See variation.]
;W[el]C[This is extremely heavy (White gives Black a target for attack).]
;B[fp]C[Very good.];W[fq];B[gq];W[fr];B[fi]LB[hp:a]C[In this case, your aggression is justified. Still, 'a' would be a marvelous, calm move.]
;W[en];B[eo];W[dn];B[co]LB[bn:a]C[It may feel as if White is forcing you, but AMAOF, he loses the possibility of attaching at 'a'. This is a loss for White.]
;W[fn];B[ho];W[gn];B[gr]C[Very good.];W[gs]LB[dr:a]C[I can't believe this. White's hane is a bad move. This is an endgame move, going for points. Those moves should not be played as long as the shapes are unsettled. White must make shape with 'a']
;B[hs]LB[dr:a]C[Better not give him a second chance to fix his shape. Should be at 'a'.]
;W[fs]C[Well, ..]
(;B[ir]C[This is a good move, but it is still better to force first with 'a'. See var.]
;W[mq];B[dr]C[Very good.];W[eq];B[bq]C[Good point. The attack is almost infallible.]
;W[bp]
(;B[cq]LB[cr:a]C[My first idea is that 53 should be at 'a'. This is var2.   Richard Hunter's theory on semeais learns us that:

in a battle between "eye" and "no eye", "eye" counts the eye liberties, plus his outside liberties, plus the inside(mutual) liberties ! "no eye" counts his outside liberties.]
;W[br];B[ar];W[bs]
(;B[bo]C[j: I missed a kill with a move inside?

dv: yes. If you know Richard Hunter's marvelous articles on "counting liberties and capturing races" (chapters 7 and in "The second book of Go") then you know that Black has to make an eye here. See the variation.]
;W[ap]
(;B[aq]LB[cs:a]C[This was your last chance to win the fight, at 'a'. See the var.]
;W[ds]
(;B[rp]LB[qn:a][pn:b]C[j: The corner seemd a gote seki  so I left it for later.

(dv) Correct. It took me a while to realize.

Was there a better invasion of white's area of influence?

(dv) With all that power along the top right, I would simply have played 'a' or 'b'.]
;W[rn]
(;B[qq]C[j: R5 immediately was better?

(dv): let's see];W[pq];B[qr]LB[pr:a]C[From the viewpoint of eyeshape, this is a poor move. 'a' instead is better.]
;W[pr];B[sr]LB[qo:a]C[As you can see, 67 makes no life locally. The first principle of Go says: "Don't get fenced in" or "First break out, then live locally". You're strong enough athe right side to break out.]
;W[rs];B[qs];W[rr]LB[qo:a]C[White is overdoing it. He should avoid complications and force you to live small, playing White 'a' instead of 68-70.]
;B[ro];W[so];B[qn];W[rm];B[qm];W[ql];B[rq];W[sp];B[po]LB[pl:a]
C[first hane at 'a'];W[ol];B[no];W[on]C[raw peep, making you stronger towards the bottom]
;B[oo];W[lo];B[nn]LB[mp:a];W[nm];B[mp];W[lp];B[nq];W[mo];B[nr]
C[simply connecting is better];W[np];B[op];W[mr];B[os]LB[nf:a]
[mn:b]C[Now that the messy fighting in the lower right has come to an end, it is good to look at the whole board. Let's look at territory and strength.

White

UR 10+ points, stable group
LL seki/14 points
Left: weak group, one move to the center stabilizes
Right: strong group but not yet completely stable
Bottom: weak group, needs 1/2 moves to center to stabilize

Black

LR 14 points, stable but almost fenced in.
LL group is quite stable but not much room for stability/development
UR group is quite stable but not much room for stability/development
UL 15 points + moyo

So, Black has the better position but there are two very hot moves for him to play:  stabilize the right and acquire power with 'a' and cut White apart with 'b'.]
;W[ph]
(;B[qh]C[This is a big mistake. See the variation.];W[pg];B[pi]
;W[oi];B[qi];W[ng]C[The power White acquires in the center is huge. Black's group now can be forced into small life.]
;B[ke]C[Of course, if your groups live and your moyo transforms into territory, you win. Alas, rarely all "ifs" are fulfilled.]
;W[ee];B[df];W[fc];B[hc];W[fg];B[eh];W[eg]C[Raw move.];B[dg]
C[Logical answer.];W[fh];B[lm]C[Althought this hits the shape of 84, 90, 86, I would simply cut at 114.]
;W[mn];B[ei]C[j: too timid?

(dv) No, correct.];W[jh]C[White now has several weaknesses. Back has more territory. Let's find a way to wrap up the game.]

(;B[hf];W[hg]C[The 117-118 exchange is not favorable for Black.]
;B[in]LB[mm:a]C[Very good move, attacking White's weakest group, and threatening the cut at 'a'. Too bad 117 and 118 have been exchanged.]
;W[km];B[jm];W[kl];B[hj]C[Very good.];W[hl];B[ik];W[ck];B[cj]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[cm];B[gf];W[fe];B[gg];W[gh];B[hh];W[hi];B[ig]
;W[ih];B[gi]C[Good, White should have played there.];W[hg];B[ef]
C[j: I think I really made a mess of this ko fight.

Is s9 better now? Before white gets s10 in as a threat.

(dv) Yes.];W[ff];B[hh];W[rj]C[j: I considered ignoring this threat

(dv) Wonderful idea. You take 90 points in the UL and become very strong in the center and on the left. White takes about 50 points at the right.]

(;B[ri];W[hg];B[cr];W[cs];B[hh];W[go];B[gp];W[hg];B[as];W[es]
;B[hh];W[ip];B[ii]C[j: I though I could live but.....

did I make a mistake somewhere in the continuation?

(dv) You must connect. It'll be hard to live after White cuts.]
;W[hp];B[ks];W[jr]C[You get a new chance.];B[js];W[ms];B[jq]
;W[kr]
(;B[kp]C[Looks like a tesuji, but it spoils the chance. Nice try though.]
;W[kq];B[jp];W[io];B[jo];W[hn];B[jl]C[j: I had it worked out  black l6 white j8 but suddenly realised I'd ignored a simple white j7 so i deciced to leave it and make the best of what was left.

Was l6 still interesting?

(dv) I'm sorry but I don't understand your analysis. The cutting point on my board is 'J3'.]
;W[iq]C[All groups have a clear status now. The endgame has begun. Let's count the score.

Black:

UL: 80
LR: 14
Right: 3

White:

LL: 57
Center: 5+
UR: 15+

Black is 20 points ahead on the goban, and he has sente. Black's aim should be to keep White's center and upper side reduced.]
;B[nb]C[Good.];W[ld];B[ne]C[(dv) With an advantage of 20 points, there is no need to complicate the game. 175 provokes the capture of 19, whih is sente against the Black group on the right.]
;W[oh];B[oe];W[pd];B[qj];W[qk];B[nd]
(;W[le];B[lf];W[mf];B[kd];W[lg];B[nc];W[pb];B[kf];W[me]LB[rk:a]
[bk:b][kk:c]C[(dv) The exchanges in the upper side have enlarged Black's territory with 3/4 points while White has lost about 5 points (I calculated his corner 15 points, now it's 10). On the other hand, White's center can be counted 15 points. So, White has closed the gap to 10+ on the board.

Big endgame moves are

'a': 6 points in reverse sente (White 'a' is sente)
'b': 10 points gote (White 'b' has a big follow up)
'c': about 7 points gote

If Black gets two of those, he can hardly lose];B[kj]LB[rk:a]
C[j: I think this would have been better at s9

I'm not happy about all my endgame from here on. I think I made many poor choices, maybe enough to have lost the game. (dv) Yes.

Advice on alternatives would be appreciated.

(dv) Starting with 'a' would have been better.];W[rk];B[sh]
;W[lc];B[lb];W[kn];B[jn];W[lj];B[kg];W[ki];B[kk];W[lk];B[li]
;W[lh];B[kh];W[mi];B[ji]LB[jg:a][jj:b][bk:c]C[j: This sequence seemed to get me about 10 points which really matered but it was gote. Afterwards I really regretted it.  Was there better?

(dv) Your last move took 6 points (a, b, 116, 138) plus some gote follow up - say 8 points. We have calculated 'c' to be 10 points.]
;W[ns];B[ps];W[bk]LB[aj:a][gk:b][nf:c][pm:d]C[White has taken two of the three big endgame moves. The game is now extremely close.

My count: White 106,5 - Black 106

Biggest remaining endgame points:

'a': 5 points gote
'b': 1 point sente (or if unanswered 4 points gote)
'c': 2 points gote
'd': 1 point gote with 1 point sente follow up.];B[aj]C[Very good.]
;W[ak];B[ai];W[pm];B[oc];W[pc];B[gk];W[gl];B[mc]C[j: again a couple of points but gote

LB[ob:a]C['a' is 1 point better];W[gm];B[sd];W[sc];B[gj];W[im]
;B[il]C[two points];W[ob]C[This is quite big: Black's shape is deficient, the move is worth two points.]
;B[na];W[ej]C[1 point: you'll have to protect later.];B[sn]

General comments and suggestions.

- Read the "Second book of Go" chapters 7 and 8, or simply remember the proverb "eyes win semeais" (but not always: read the book !)
(moves 57-59)

- Simplify the game when you're ahead. (move 175). Count the score, look for the big endgame points and try to play in a way that you get most of them.

- Your endgame is good. But hers was better. (191-192, 210).

(I noticed in the end that your opponent is female, but I didn't take the time to correct everywhere).]
