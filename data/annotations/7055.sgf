* I will not talk about fancy stuff and tsumego because i am too weak to be sure about my moves. I will point out the moves that i feel good or bad about. If i miss something important (and i will surely do that), please don't be mad at me :)]

* Why is this white move not joseki? Because the shape is a lot weaker than with the usual move at O17.

* However, i dont see a good way to attack right now. The weak spots are probably A or B, but playing there is too early. White did not get anything great with his move, so just leave the situation as it is and look forward to playing, say, C in sente later.]

* No more comments.

* White was superior throughout the game. Black was very very passive. Black should try to find the correct direction of play, then white will be in trouble. Overall, white played well in this game.

I think tsumego and a quick look at common joseki are helpful to both players.

But most of all, both players (and especially black) need to consider the health of groups. If groups are weak, they need to be attacked or (higher level) threatened to be attacked at some point. Black went far too easy on the J3 group, and i think this was the biggest mistake in the game.

But do not be disappointed, because you can become a lot stronger! I will give you a hint that made me 2k when i was 4 kyu: Always, no matter when, read at least 4 moves ahead. Always!! Then you will avoid a lot of mistakes and easily gain strength, because you are forced to find weaknesses of the move you considered and calculate a better move :)

Good luck!
