C[Comments for the GTL by Erik Ekholm, Swedish 1 dan. Apr 97.

NM: In this game, I felt that I was
reasonably ahead after I managed to  reduce the B moyo; but in the end
(after some endgame mistakes) I found
I was losing.  I would welcome
comments especially on the "strategic"
aspects of the first 150 moves.];B[pd]C[

C[
 Niall 5k*: is entering byo-yomi

EE: This isn't joseki (explanation later). a) seems like a reasonable choice.]
;W[rq];B[pq];W[ro]MA[lp]LB[mq:A][no:B]C[EE: If the marked stone had been at a), Black's san-san attachment would have worked better, because he could play b) making miai of pressing on the right or at the place of the marked stone. Here, Black is heavy.]
;B[on];W[pm]C[EE: Good. (I think we have seen this in another game of yours, Neil?)]
;B[ko]LB[ln:A]C[EE: This smells of overplay. a) feels sounder.]
;W[lo];B[om]C[NM: I was happy to make more
4th-line territory ...];W[pl];B[ln];W[kp];B[kn];W[ip]C[EE: Black has accomplished little, besides giving White profit and strength on both sides. It seems White has a lead.]
;B[fp]LB[dq:A]C[EE: Black is really asking for beating; if he feels he must play around here, why not at a) to get a base at least?]
;W[dq]C[EE: Simple but good.];B[mo];W[mp]C[EE: You can't be 100% sure this will be sente.]
;B[no];W[ho]C[NM: Was this too cautious? I wanted
to make sure that B couldn't cut
between this stone and L4 ...

EE: Playing stronger is probably possible, but I see no definitely superior variation. This move is reliable and White should be able to keep the initiative.]
;B[fn];W[dm];B[dj]LB[ek:A]C[EE: Black is a really greedy player ... He will have his hands full if White leans on him at a) for example.]
;W[hm];B[fl];W[go]C[NM: Intended to ensure the link while
making B heavy ...];B[fo];W[qf]LB[ek:A]MA[pl]C[EE: White a) would be embarrasing for Black. It would make a logical continuation after making Black heavy. The kakari is undeniably large, since the marked stone is on the 4th line, but the right side is more "played out" than the top, which could mean a kakari from the other side might be more interesting. Really hard (for me) to be definite.]
;B[pf]C[EE: This aims to make White overconcentrated on the right - a good strategy it seems.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[qh];B[md]LB[nd:A]C[EE: a) was the joseki move last time I checked. Not easy to exploit any aji in top right, though,]
;W[fc]LB[ek:A]C[NM: I had to invade. Was this the best
point? It seemed to me there was little
point in say G16, since the Q16 group
was so solid; and C14 would have
allowed B to reinforce the D10 group.
But maybe I should have taken D13?

EE: Looking only at the top, F17 looks like a natural point. But I still feel that a) is such a good attacking move that it should take priority.]
;B[hc];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[bc];B[fd];W[fb];B[hk]MA[fl]
[fn][fo][fp]C[EE: After Black's extra thickness and his sente, which he used to reinforce at H9, it is much harder to get an attack on the marked group. Yet, White has only made natural-looking moves at the top, so where was the mistake? Maybe it was a mistake not to attack directly. But White has profit in  many places, so the game still looks ok for White.]
;W[gd]C[NM: I felt that I had to push into the
moyo. Was this the best way?

EE: It is a standard move. It is hard (for me) to evaluate it here.]

 kelly 5k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[he];W[id];B[ie]C[
 Niall 5k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[jd]LB[kc:A]C[EE: Black's next move might be anticipated - white could forestall it by playing a) here instead.]
;B[kc];W[jc]C[EE: This is a bit painful, but perhaps necessary.]
;B[gr];W[hr]C[NM: I read through the sequence
that was actually played, and decided
that I was happy with B making a live,
but separated, small group here; it
would leave the F4 stones weak and
attackable.

EE: Giving your opponent a ponnuki is almost always wrong - I think this is no exception. (3 reasons coming later)]
;B[hq]LB[ir:A]C[EE: I think White should pull back at a).];W[gq]
;B[ir];W[fq];B[gp];W[hp];B[iq];W[fr]
(;B[jp]C[NM: I was more concerned that he might play K3 (see variation)

EE: See a variation in the variation for a way to kill him.]
;W[jq];B[jr];W[jo];B[hs];W[kr]C[EE: Reason 1 (why #62/64 was disputable): Black has eaten up most of your bottom territory.]
;B[js];W[jn];B[jl];W[jm];B[km];W[il];B[jk]C[EE: Reason 2: These moves, which you feel compelled to play to secure your group, strengthens Black's centre.]
;W[gl]
(;B[gk]LB[fk:A]C[EE: Reason 3: Black could pull back to a) if he wants to save his four stones. White can break out into the centre, but I am not convinced it is worth the trouble to do so (variation).

I see no serious White attack on them. Giving the four stones up, as he does in the game, is probably also okay.]
;W[fm];B[em];W[gm];B[dl];W[en];B[el]
(;W[ih]C[NM: Was this too deep?  I was thinking
about J12, K12, L12.  Or should I have
attacked from another side?

EE: This is deep indeed. He is quite thick around here and you have a long way to run, so I think it is safe to declare this stone dead. The main question you should ask yourself is: "How much do I need?" (see variation)]
;B[je];W[kd];B[lc];W[ke];B[jg];W[cm]C[EE: Very big.];B[bl]C[EE: Looks like correct shape.]
;W[bm]C[NM: I thought B7 was necessary to
secure the corner.  Mark you, I also
thought it was sente...

EE: Not at this stage, but it is still a big move.];B[dr];W[er]
;B[jb];W[ib]C[

of reviving H17, but it seemed too small
to me at the moment.];B[kh]C[

LB[ok:A][oj:B]C[NM: I thought I had sente, but he was
right...

EE: Is such a deep reduction really possible?
White a) or b) might work. There's a tough reading exercise! :-)]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[pk];B[qi];W[rj]LB[pi:A]C[EE: If White weren't ahead, a) would be interesting, but no need to confuse things.]
;B[pi];W[ri]C[NM:... which seemed to make his attack
pretty pointless....

EE: Still, you were pretty strong here and he has managed to press you down to the second line. I don't think he is unhappy, as he can consider his stones as kikashi.]
;B[qn];W[pn];B[po];W[qo];B[ph];W[rk]C[NM: Just enough aji that I had to do
something, but I should have protected
at R13, making P13 gote.];B[og];W[qg];B[hb];W[ic];B[ia];W[gc]

 Niall 5k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[cs];B[ds];W[es]C[NM: ...which left a wonderful possibility
of ko at G1.  Unfortunately I needed
a rock-crushing ko threat, and
never had one big enough....

EE: True, White has much more at stake here.];B[cr];W[aq];B[co]

;W[bn];B[cl];W[aq]LB[am:A]C[EE: I see no danger here. F5 has too few liberties, but maybe I'm missing something ...

If you feel you want to spend a move here,
a) is better, since it affects the outside.];B[sq];W[sp];B[ap]
;W[gn]C[NM: There were just enough nasty
possibilities that I wanted to remove
the aji. Was I being too conservative?

EE: See previous comment.];B[lr];W[ks];B[ls];W[kq];B[nq];W[nl]
C[NM: Again N2 would get me about 6
points, but in gote.

EE: I count N2 as around 9 points (5 points more for White {don't forget K4} and 3-5 points less for Black).]

 kelly 5k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[nf];W[lf];B[cg]C[
 Niall 5k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[nk]C[NM: I wanted to avoid the possibility of an
attack on the corner by linking my
groups; at the least it seemed to me that
would gain me some points such as
M13, and it left me with some attacks
round M8.  But the difference is that
A13 was sente for B ...
Was my reasoning sound?

EE: With G18 and G19 sente for White, I cannot even imagine a seki threat against your corner, so O9 is very small, perhaps 3 points. A13 is 3 points in reverse sente (=6), but the biggest plays are S15 + hane + connect  in sente, followed by N2. That would ensure a safe win for White.]
;B[ag];W[ac];B[rd];W[re];B[se];W[sf];B[sd]C[NM: I hadn't realised that T16 was
sente for B ....];W[rg];B[mq];W[ik];B[ij];W[ps];B[os];W[pp]
;B[oq];W[oo];B[np];W[qs]C[NM: Now I should have continued the
attack, with something like O6. The
trouble was I was convinced I was about
10 points ahead .... :-(

EE: Not anymore, it looks quite close.];B[mm];W[ll]C[EE: Whoops, not connected! Maybe the final losing move.]

;B[pe];W[ld];B[mc];W[oc]C[NM: Now I realised I was losing by 1-2
points, so I decided I should try some-
thing desperate...

White: R 30 + T 20 + BL 43 + 5.5 = 98.5
Black: TR 20 + BL 3 + BR 3 + Centre = 25 + Centre

Can he make 98.5-25=73.5 points in the centre?

Not very likely, since every reducing move you make is likely to be sente. So the conclusion is: play normal moves to win.]
