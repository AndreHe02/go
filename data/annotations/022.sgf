However B was kind enough to play 'a', which is not urgent. B should have attacked the
marked stones (see variation B).]

B 'a' would be better. But attacking the marked stones is still better.]

at 'b' (variation B), but then W can capture the left group with W 'd'.

other group with B 'b' later. Variation C might be black's best defense but I have
not gone through all possible variations.]

Rob- At this point, I felt I was ahead comfortably. I horribly misplayed the coming
sequence..

jloup: I think that W 'a' would have been bigger than b5. Such a move at the
frontier between two territories is often 'the only move'.];B[rl];W[rn]

saves some center territory.];B[qh]L[si][qk]C[W 'a' is trying too hard to kill; it's too late now. W 'b' would at least save
a maximum of what can be saved (see variation).]
(;W[si];B[qk];W[ql]L[pk]C[W r8 is trying too hard to kill. W should limit the damage at 'a'.]
;B[pk]L[rm][oj]C[W 'a' is very bad, but 'b' also fails (see variation). W has no good move now.
This is the consequence of W t11 and r8 which were too greedy.]
(;W[rm];B[oj];W[pi];B[pl];W[qm]L[mj]C[It should be obvious that B lives now, so W should not bother about a single stone
and must escape at 'a'.];B[nk];W[nj];B[mk];W[lj];B[lk];W[kj]L[om]M[ql]
[qm][rm][rn][qn][pn][po]C[Since B 'a' is sente (threatens capture of the marked stones), B has really
no problem making eyes.];B[kl]C[Now it is white's turn to be attacked. The bottom W group has no eyes and
the top group has only one eye at p11 or t17.];W[jm];B[jl];W[im];B[il];W

[hm];B[gm];W[gl]L[gk][fn]C[B 'a' was too defensive. B wins easily with variation B. Black probably
felt still under attack, but should have seen that he was now in a position
to attack.]
(;B[gk]L[fl][gn]C[W could have tried variation B but it does not work either.]

(;W[fl];B[fk]L[el][gn][om][hj]C[B f9 is a big mistake; it should have been at 'b' to ensure the capture of the bottom

W group. After B at 'b', living locally at 'c' or escaping at 'd' are still miai,
so B wins.

However W was very kind and did not accept the offer to save his bottom group.
W 'a' should also have been at 'b' (see variation).]

at 'a'.];W[gn]C[W should be infinitely grateful for such a gift :-)];B[ek]
L[sc][oi][rd][lg][mj]C[The W right side group is almost dead (can only make one eye at either 'a' or 'b' but

not both), but B could just finish the game by playing at 'c'. After B 'c', W 'b'

is gote so B can afford to strength himself around 'd'. Or B (probably better)

can play 'd' immediately leaving 'a' and 'b' as miai. Then B has no weaknesses and

cannot lose the fight. Note that 'd' also threatens a cut at 'e' so W collapses
in all cases.];W[sc]C[W t17 good, but it's only one eye :-(];B[rd]L[oi]

;W[ka]C[W L19 is 6 points in gote. There are bigger moves elsewhere. In the yose, keeping

sente is very important. For example W t3 is a big sente move. W b4 is reverse sente,
so it is as big as a sente move.];B[hh]L[of][hi]C[B h12 doesn't do much, it is almost a dame (neutral point of no value). The B center

group is not in danger since it can connect if necessary at either 'a' or 'b'.]

very late in the yose. Since W k6 would be gote, W will not play it now so B has plenty

fight.
