C[To reviewer:
Hello! In this game i played  black and losed it by 45 pts :( There were no big killing, but my defence was bad, so to the end of the game a had only 40 pts of territory. I'll be grateful for comments to my opening and, especially, to middle-game reduction.
Thank you in advance for your help!

(;B[hd]C[Usually black attaches to secure a base (see variation)]

(;W[do]C[FR:
Is it better to pincer at C8 or D8?
Sure those pincer's are possible not my favorite though.]
(;B[cp]C[This move is a good idea but a little too soft (see continuation)
If you want to secure the corner you might consider c5 instead.]

(;B[dr]LB[cq:A][er:B]C[This move is technically possible but usually people play either A or B.  A is fairly simple (see variation) B is extremely complicated and I don't recommend it.]
;W[er];B[cm]LB[dn:A]C[A is better, following the proverb "hane at the head of two stones"]
;W[dn];B[dk]LB[cn:A]C[A is easier =).  In general its a good idea to connect at a peep.]

C[FR:
Is this approach to the corner right? Maybe q5 or even settling bottom with l3 better.

This approach is fine, q5 is fine as well.];W[np];B[pl]LB[qq:A]
C[Again attach at A as shown earlier.];W[qf]
(;B[qj]C[FR:
to peaceful :(Was R12 or Q12 more  appropriate?

This move is a good idea in theory.  It is a double purpose move,  helping the base of your r5 and r8 stones while pincering the r14 stone.  But I think this move is a little bit cramped so playing two spaces further at r12 is better.]
;W[ph]
(;B[qd]C[This is a good idea again, but its a little bit too passive.  See continuation]
;W[lc];B[jc]C[FR:
I think, it's my big misstake. Was it better to defend the corner by o17?

Its probably slightly better to defend the corner because the e16 stones can secure a bse easily by attaching at c17.  However I don't think its a major issue.  This way is certaintly playable.]

C[FR:
Moves 49-53 look like i'm helping white to build wall. Is it necessary for p16 to run to the center or tenuki was better? If "yes", then where to play?

Yes you are helping white build a wall, but you are building your own wall with the triangled stones.  Also your wall is better then white's wall because your wall is facing a weak group and will help you to attack the squared stones.  While white's wall is facing black's strong group at k17.  So this is locally good for black.   To answer your question.  Yes it is necessary for p16 to run to the center because its base is not secure.  So this is a very good way to play.  Split white into two weak group while securing space for yourself in the center.]
;W[ke];B[oi];W[oh];B[ni]LB[mh:A][ni:2][oi:1]C[These are the two biggest mistakes by black of the game so far.  White should play at A.  However, white's group is weak and needs to run to the center.  So black's one and two force white to the center (at A) which is exactly what white wants.  So instead black should try to surround white without attaching and pushing.]
;W[pi];B[nk];W[pj];B[pk];W[mi];B[nn]LB[oi:A]C[A stone is very big because it prevents whtie from making an eye so you should save them.]

(;B[kq]C[FR:
Here i wanted to reduce white's potential moyo at the bottom, but just helped them to build quite big territory. So, is L3 good, Maybe something around j4 better?

L3 is fine,  m3 is slightly better shape in relation to o3 ( see continuation)]

C[FR: In the game i hoped to get som territory with k7, but it was very small. Now i think, that it was wrong dirrection, but just dont know, where to play? Maybe f9 or something around h12?

Yes k7 is very small, only a couple of points.  Instead black should continue to attack white's q3 stones.  When this is finished black should start endgame (c19 for example).  As a general rule, when you odn't know where to play its a good time to start endgame.]

All in all its a very good game.  Your opening is better then you think it is.  In this game black had two main weaknesses.  Black was too cautious when he needed to attack, and black failed to realize when to attack and what groups to attack.  Hope my review could help.
