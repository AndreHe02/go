C[Slyrp:

I ended up winning this game by the slightess of margins (played black). Typical of my games I fall behind at the start and then crawl my way back in. If you could comment on which moves were wasted / better ways to respond then that'd be cool]
PL[B];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[oq];W[pq];B[op];W[pn];B[kq]
C[Slyrp:

Standard joseki -> Is there a better alternative

RickMott: No, this seems reasonable to me.  It's
a bit unusual for both players to try for a
Chinese opening.  Since you have the first-
move advantage, I might have considered J17
instead of the approach at P3 in the first
place.  But once you play P3, this is the
continuation you expect.  Certainly doesn't
seem bad.];W[mp]C[Slyrp:

This is where I am weak. I don't know how to respond to moves such as this. I am guessing white is wanting to press me down here, so I cut first]
;B[no]C[RickMott: I would connect at N3 right away.
This is an overplay for White.  Stay solid
and let him worry about how he's going to
have that stone be useful in any way.

If you're going to play a contact move,
don't contact the weak single stone.
Play at P6 instead.  (remember that
diagonal relationships are also
considered contact moves in a fight.)
Strengthens your wall, weakens N4,
and puts some pressure on the white
corner group.

But it's still better to connect first.
White obliged you by playing up at N5
on the next move.

If I were white, I would split your
groups with N2 or O2.  The resulting
fight will be tricky, but since
white has 2 threats (connect to the
corner or escape to the center),
it will be a problem for you.];W[mo]C[RickMott: mistake by White, as we just
discussed.];B[mq]C[Slyrp:

Seeing the cut wasn't going to be to effective, I connect underneath

RickMott: good, staying connected is important.];W[kp];B[lp]
C[RickMott: save this for later.  White's
group has no eyes and will be a target
for you.  Just connect at M3 now and
let White worry about what to do next.];W[lo];B[lq];W[jo]C[Slyrp:

At this point I couldn't decide whether to respond locally, or play elsewhere. Feeling as though this will be a weak part of my board, and since going K3 onwards would only give white a strong wall, I played E17.

RickMott: Walls with no base aren't so strong.  My personal preference
would be to atari and extend at K4, J4 immediately.  If he chases you,
fine, you're making 4th line territory on what used to be his side
of the board, and he still has to worry about his group because it
has neither a base nor a guaranteed connection to the corner.    Compare with allowing K3, which will be sente because your group  doesn't have much eye space.  I think this area is urgent.]
;B[ec];W[di]C[RickMott: This move shouldn't be good for white.
It's too close to your strong corner and too
far from his 4-4 stone.];B[pj]C[Slyrp:

Q10 seemed good as I thought it would put pressure on q6. Maybe I needed to go closer. Other options I saw: K16 / K17 both of which look better now.

RickMott:  hard to say, but since you have both extensions from Q16
open I wouldn't rush to play either of them now.  White has really
made two overplays, with N4 and D11.  You need to find a way to
punish him for at least one of them.  I'd either start the K4-L5-J4
sequence now or approach at C6.];W[jd]C[RickMott: Wow, this guy likes to play like Air Jordan.
These are being played like reducing moves, but there's
nothing to reduce yet.  Both high white stones should
become targets for you -- not now, but after some
development elsewhere.];B[ql]C[Slyrp:

To follow through on P10


RickMott: Definitely the wrong area on the board now.
This is small; bigger plays are the K4 etc. sequence,
the approach at C6 (with followups either against the
D11 stone or double approach to D4), or something
like M17 to make it hard for K16 to get a base on
the top.];W[pl]C[RickMott: but he answers locally, so you're still OK.]
;B[pk];W[qm];B[rl];W[rm]C[RickMott: all local answers, leaving the big points
 on the board unplayed, but you wind up with sente
pretty much by accident.  You must now prevent
White from creating a moyo out of all these floating
stones.];B[pp];W[qq];B[om]C[Slyrp:

My aim here was to make a path out to the middle, then whites lower wall would be useless]
;W[pm];B[po];W[qo];B[on];W[ol];B[mm]C[RickMott: In this whole sequence, you're both
missing the big points, but this is not a good
move.  White can come in at O4 and threaten
to cut your group apart by either starting a
ko on O5-P5 or by descending to O3.  Your
group will lose eye space and come under
attack.  Stop thinking about it as a white
"wall" and think of it as 5 stones with no
base and no eyes.];W[nl];B[kn]C[RickMott:  Oops.  You're going to force him
to connect in the one place you can gain an
advantage.  Why??  Play K4 atari!  It has
the additional useful feature of making your
group some extra eye space, given the O4
weakness.];W[ko];B[mn];W[jq]C[Slyrp:

I was willing to give up most of bottom, realising C3 was still open

RickMott: but that misses the point.  You've let White turn his
group from a target into an asset.  This is a huge strategic loss
for you.  Even if you couldn't kill his group in the end, you
could make profit on the bottom in sente while attacking it.]
;B[jr];W[iq]C[Slyrp:

rather than follow, I plyed m17 to see what white's plan for K16 was.]
;B[lc]C[RickMott: This was one of my suggested moves earlier.
I like it because it's a dual-purpose move, both
extending your corner moyo and making it harder for
K16 to make a base.];W[gd]C[RickMott: this is odd.  Doesn't do much for White.
Your strategic choices at this point are to solidify
your upper right moyo or reduce White's lower left.
I prefer the latter, because of D11's overly long
extension.];B[nc]C[Slyrp:

I was throwing up between this and Q13. I think Q13 is better

RickMott: You can't defend this moyo with one move.  My
inclination is to destroy first, say at C6.  Then let
white decide which side of your moyo to reduce and solidify
the other side while attacking.  White still has a problem
with those two floating stones on the 16th line.  A fight
around move 47 will weaken them considerably.];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph]
;B[pi]C[RickMott: This would be better at R11.  Saves complication later.]
;W[qg];B[rh]C[RickMott: See?  If R12 hadn't been left so weak,
you could have protected your corner now instead
of being forced to defend.];W[rg]C[Slyrp: Didn't like this shape at all. So played in centre (symetic play in middle)]
;B[rj]C[RickMott: yes, some kind of defensive play is
necessary here.  White should not have been
left with sente; that's why connecting back
with R11 instead of Q11 would be so much
better.];W[rd]C[RickMott: This is an unusual situation.  The standard
R17 response is probably not correct.  You want to try
to deny white eye space for his group.  You can let
him live in the corner if you can kill the 4 outside
stones as a result.

I like R16 here.  If white tries to take your corner,
you can hane at S15 and fight.  If he backs off, your
corner is bigger and he still has to make 2 eyes.];B[qc];W[rc]
C[RickMott: this sequence is too easy on white;
he makes eyes with no problem.];B[rb];W[qd];B[pb];W[pe]C[RickMott: Q18 should have been a solid connection
at Q17, which denies white the potential atari
at F16.];B[od];W[oe]C[RickMott: If you had connected at Q17, you
could have hane'd in sente where 64 is and
walled white in.  Then go back and attack
the 16th line white stones.];B[ne];W[nh]C[Slyrp:

Rather than push out at O10, I decided to leave it till later and play elsewhere. Big points I can see at this stage:

C13

Somewhere around D7

C3

K18 / G18

middle area (to early)

RickMott: I still like the C6 approach.  C13 is bad
because the obvious response lets White fix his
too-big extension at D11, when what you want to
do is punish it.  D7 is wishy-washy.  If you're
going to do a high approach, go closer at D6.
K18/G18 -- save this for later.  You want to
see how fighting elsewhere goes first.];B[cg];W[cl];B[cq]C[Slyrp:

Had to take this to make up for c8. General plan was to give white a small bottom area, and maybe a bit on the right, and then invade his "bigger area" in middle from L6, O10, M14, E12

RickMott: As I said, I don't like C13 because it makes it too
easy for white to fix his problems, but once you do C13 this is
a reasonable continuation.];W[dq];B[cp]C[Slyrp:

Standard Joseki];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn]C[Slyrp:

I realise here, that I was a bit lucky?

RickMott: No, pretty much what you would
expect.  You'll have to nullify white's
outside influence, though.];W[bm];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[fq];B[eh]
;W[ei];B[fh];W[ir]C[Slyrp:

Is it me or is this a very small move by white? (5 points or so)]
;B[kr]C[RickMott:  It's not small if you answer it.
Once you do the E12-F12 sequence, you must
aim at attacking the 16th line stones since
you've strengthened white's wall on the left.

You could play F11 immediately, threatening
to break into white's area.  Then make some
move like L14 to start hemming white in.

White's upper right group has a weakness,
too.  You could play O13 and then extend
left along the 13th line.  If white hanes
against O13 with N13, play the open
connection at P14.  This threatens atari
at R15 followed by S15, capturing 3 stones
and taking away most of white's eye space.];W[lm];B[ln]C[RickMott: Pointless move for white.  Say thank you.]
;W[ml];B[km];W[kl];B[im];W[il];B[hm]C[Slyrp:

Trying to make left and bottom very small

RickMott: yes, good reduction, I don't know
what white was thinking to start this.];W[gn];B[gm];W[hn];B[in]
;W[io];B[fm];W[fn];B[dn]C[Slyrp:

I think this was not a very good move. G10 perhaps? Elsewhere?

RickMott: D7 is fine and sente.  White really has to respond.]
;W[do];B[dm]C[Slyrp:

again, I am throwing away moves here unless I really wanted to cut, but I didn't, and white saw that]
;W[dl];B[en];W[eo];B[gj];W[fk];B[fj];W[ej];B[hh]C[Slyrp:

I have seen this shape in a joseki before. Is it stable / non cuttable?

RickMott: Maybe, but it isn't important right now.  The most urgent
thing on the board for black is to press the attack against the
16th line stones.  You've set that up beautifully, now you have
to follow through.

Consider a move like L14, starting to close off the last avenue
of escape.];W[el];B[em]C[RickMott: Ignore the 3 stones, use the move to attack
at the top.];W[ij];B[jg]C[Slyrp:

Realising I could compress from the right with o10, I went to put pressure on the top

RickMott: Right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!];W[kb];B[lb]C[RickMott: No, no, no.  You must destroy white's
base and keep him from making eye space.  Your
corner is not at risk of being killed, don't
waste a move defending its territory.

Somethink like H17, maybe.];W[kc];B[ld];W[kf];B[ie]C[RickMott: Why here?  Consider L16.  How can White
answer?  If he plays K15 to try to connect out,
cut with K17.  If not, block his escape with L14.
Keep the peeps in reserve to reduce eye space
later.

H17 is still interesting.];W[id];B[je];W[kd];B[ke]C[Slyrp:   This wasn't really needed. I think G18 is much bette

RickMott: Yes, something to attack the eye space.r];W[fc];B[fb]
;W[gb];B[eb];W[ed];B[dd];W[ee];B[dg]C[RickMott: This is a pointless move.  What are
you worried about?  Your middle stones can
always either connect to the 7th line group
via G9 or to the upper group via M15.

So you have to look at the board for something
to attack or to make territory, preferably
both.  How about B11, expanding your corner
while threatening to hollow out white's group?
Then the C7 cut becomes sente, too.

Or how about M13, netting the white stone?];W[he];B[if];W[hf]
;B[hg];W[kh];B[jh];W[kg]C[Slyrp:   What big points lie open at this stage? I went down in a line as I new white would get little from it. Though maybe B11 would be better.

RickMott: Yes, I like B11.];B[ji];W[ki];B[jj];W[nf]C[RickMott: You can ignore this.  G9 sets up two
attacks:  (1) the B11 with C7 followup, or
(2) M8, with K8 followup.  G9 also guarantees
the top group's connection, so a cut at M15
doesn't matter.];B[me];W[kj];B[jk]C[RickMott: B11 is bigger.]
;W[jl];B[nj]C[Slyrp:

Tiem to make the side invasion before it is to late..];W[mj]
;B[ik]C[Slyrp:

Grab some more territory, and setup connection];W[ni];B[nk]
;W[mk];B[bi]C[Slyrp:

I got to play b11!];W[cj];B[bj]C[RickMott: should be at B9.  Greater
reduction, takes eye space, makes
C7 cut a real threat.];W[bk];B[gk];W[fl];B[mf];W[mg];B[pr]C[Slyrp:

I was still a little paranoid since a lot depended on this group, so I played here giving up sente, but giving me sanity!


RickMott: You don't have to fear for the group.  It's connection
to the upper right cannot be broken. G8/H8 are miai.  But this
is a big endgame move anyway.

The atari at P14 is interesting.  White has to give you the
stone and protect his cut at R15, otherwise you get 3 stones
as I mentioned before.];W[qr];B[or];W[an];B[bp];W[ci];B[ch]
;W[ef];B[df]C[RickMott: F14 might work better.];W[gg];B[gh]
;W[fg];B[sh]C[Slyrp:

I wasn't happy about this shape either, so I thought I would make it safer in sente. Fortunately, he followed.

RickMott: You don't have anything to worry about.  White can't
attack this group.];W[sg];B[sl]C[RickMott: Why not the hane at T7, which is 4 points
in sente???];W[sm];B[sb]C[Slyrp:

A point or two, but also wanted to try something on the R16 group

RickMott:  Again, hane at T17 is better.];W[ps];B[os];W[qs]
;B[kk]C[Slyrp:

Stoopid move! M9 is better.

RickMott: No, this is OK because it ought to be
sente.  If white allows you to capture at M8,
you'll catch 3 stones.];W[lk];B[ao];W[am];B[ka];W[ja]C[Slyrp:

We are now well into end game.
