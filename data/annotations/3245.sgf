akaisora: I added a couple comments to describe my reasoning during game and which moves of mine I don't like after the game.

Summary:  Black needs to study direction of play more.  He often played in the wrong direction.  He should also study the difference between 3rd line and 4th line stones.  His stones do not work well together.]
;B[pd];W[pp]C[Joe: Black invites a fighting game.];B[cq]C[Joe: Black initiates a fighting game.  Opposite corners do not work well together to build a moyo.  Additonally a stone on the 3-3 point is not a moyo oriented game.]
;W[de]
(;B[jj]C[akaisora: I was hearing about this moyo thing so often, that I decided to try it ...

Joe: There is no moyo in this game, this is a bad plan to follow.  In the opening the corners are the most important place, then the sides, then the middle.  3 corners are done, but the top left is not finished.   The top left is the biggest point on the board.  See variations.]
;W[dc]
(;B[np]C[Joe: This black stone is trying ot make a moyo with a 3-3 stone.  It's inconsistent.  It also not very severe on white.   Also after the corners the sides are the biggest points to play in.  The top side is huge, next biggest is the right.  then the bottom, then the left.]

(;W[pn];B[nn];W[pl];B[pq];W[qq];B[oq];W[qr];B[iq]C[akaisora: And here's something that looks like a moyo to me.

Joe: but it's not.  all your stones are on the 3rd line, and K10 does nto coordinate well with this at all.  This should get squished down easily. K16 is still the big point.]
;W[mc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[jc];B[oj]C[Joe: The left side is the biggest side to play on.  By playing on the 5th line, the right side will not become blacks and it did not enlarge the middle much at all.  It is still open at the top and from the right side.]
;W[qj];B[pj];W[qi];B[ph]C[akaisora: I would like to have this one commented. I marked 4 other areas that look interesting too. It's not that Q12 is some kind of horrible mistake, but aren't some of the others better ?

Joe: Q18 is too far from N17 to be a big threat to the corner so the corner is fine, no linkage is necessary.  Thus this move does not take territory, nor does it attack white, and it doesn't seperate white.  This is a dame point.  The left side is the biggest area to play on. D10 is best.  N15, O8, are just as pointless as Q12.  F4 builds the 3-3 corner up, but it fails to address the huge left side.  D6 is the right direction for building, but too slow.  D10 is the only move.]
;W[dn]C[Joe: Excellent move by white.  It shows the folly of blacks plan.  White is way ahead in this game already.]

(;B[fp]C[Joe: Wrong direction.  There is no joseki for black to play that will be good for him.  If you look at the whole board, black has put a lot of stone in the middle and it's a trap for white to walk into.  Black should attack vigourously and hope to kill white on a big scale.  See variation.]
;W[cj]
(;B[cl]C[akaisora: What is the correct line of play here ? Certainly not the one I tried. I wanted to give White something in exchange for closing the moyo, but I didn't play well and gave up too much.

Joe: If you want to block off the middle then starting on the 3rd line is wrong.  You need to start on the 4th line and force white under.  See variation.

Joe: I don't really see a way to make the middle big at this point.]

It has tons of aji and black has nothing to compensate for it.]
