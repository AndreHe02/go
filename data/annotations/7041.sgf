C[Emoticon: This is a game I recently played at KGS. My opponent stated that he is 15k.
In this game I clearly wasn't at my best.

Inego: Hi, my name is Yanis Batura and I currently play as Googol [7k\] on KGS. The review was requested for Black. Whenever I say "you" I address to the Black player (Emoticon). See my general comments at the end of the game.]
;B[pd];W[dq]C[Emoticon [14k?\]: Good game.];B[pq]C[kauchih: hi]
;W[cd];B[ed];W[cf]LB[dc:A][gc:B]C[Inego: Now W has two stones near the UL corner and you have one. The corner is particularly important at this stage of the game. W can enclose it with A or attack your stone severely with B. You really shouldn't leave your stone alone here as you did.]

(;B[qo]C[Inego: You had to answer at the UL corner (see var.)]
;W[qf];B[qi]C[Emoticon: I hoped to use this stone with the shimari below, but it didn't turned out so.

Inego: The move is OK.];W[qd];B[qc]C[Emoticon: What would be more appropriate continuation here?

Inego: 11 is the only move. But your next move was not the best.]
;W[rd]C[Inego: Now you really should block the way to the corner with S17.]

(;B[lc];W[ql]LB[oi:B][rc:C][pk:A]C[Emoticon: Is A better here?

Inego: Both 14 and A are not the best moves for W. 14 (or A) provokes B to jump at B thus making two W groups weak. W had to run its weak group to the center or gain some eyespace with C instead of A.]
;B[qm]LB[oi:A]C[Inego: Better was A. 15 makes W to run out with its stone thus putting pressure on your B stone, and that is not what you want.]
;W[pm];B[rm];W[rl];B[hc]LB[qi:A][oi:B]C[Inego: This move makes you some territory but it's not an urgent one. Your A stone is in danger and can be easily attacked. You should run at B.]
;W[pc]LB[rc:A]C[Inego: Here comes the punishment for you not having stopped W at A.]
;B[oc]C[Inego: Correct side for atari.];W[pb];B[ob]C[Inego: Good, sealing W off in sente.]
;W[qb];B[fp]LB[co:A]C[Inego: Too high and on the wrong side. Don't let W have the L side. A was much better.]
;W[fq];B[gq]C[Inego: Good, the only choice.];W[ep];B[gp]C[Emoticon: Maybe I should have played F2 as kikashi?

Inego: 29 was OK.];W[fr];B[kq];W[mq]LB[cc:A][co:B]C[Emoticon: I didn't like the following fight. What would be the better way to attack the invading stone?

Inego: Since this move doesn't threat anything and very likely can't be captured, I think you could make big moves like A or B and return to 32 when you finish them in sente.]
;B[lp]C[Inego: Good, strengthening your D group while attacking W stone.]
;W[no]LB[pq:A]C[Inego: Here W jumped out with keima (knight's move), which can be cut if there are friendly stones nearby (A in this case). See var. on the next move.]

(;B[on]LB[mp:A][np:B]C[Inego: 34 could be cut at A or B (see var.)]
;W[nn];B[oo];W[om]C[Inego: The chances to cut are now gone.]
;B[ck]C[Inego: The move is big.];W[op];B[pp];W[nq];B[oq]LB[cc:A]
[cn:B][oi:C]C[Inego: This move was tiny! What you did is just threaten a useless stone which then connected. The result was scanty. You had tremendously big moves like A, B or C here. Before making moves like 43, ask yourself: how will the opponent answer? What will be then? What will I, and what will he gain? Aren't there more important moves on the board? The more often you talk to yourself like this during your play, the better your results will be.]
;W[np];B[cn]C[Inego: Great!];W[ci];B[bp]LB[cc:A][oi:B]C[Inego: Good, but not as big as A or B.]
;W[cm];B[dm];W[bq];B[cp];W[cq];B[cl];W[pi];B[ph];W[qh];B[pg]
;W[qg];B[oi];W[pj]
(;B[pe]LB[oe:A]C[Inego: This move creates a weak chain of stones. A is more solid and defensive move here.]
;W[pf];B[of];W[oe];B[ne];W[og]C[Inego: Your opponent's tesuji is of a level higher than [15k\].]
;B[nf];W[oh];B[jd]LB[cc:A]C[Emoticon: Maybe too slow?

Inego: You are right. A is bigger.];W[gr];B[hr];W[fo];B[go]
;W[en];B[eg]C[Inego: Dubious. Too long jump too near to W stones.]
;W[gn]C[Inego: An excellent move from W.];B[fm];W[fn]LB[hq:A]
C[Emoticon: I forgot about weakness at A and it dealt big ammount of damage later.

Inego: Right, the shape around A became very weak now.];B[cg]
;W[bg];B[ch];W[bh];B[eh];W[di];B[jg]C[Emoticon: Again, looks like a slow hand.

Inego: The move is very big although it doesn't attack W.];W[hq]
;B[iq];W[hp];B[ip];W[ho];B[ir];W[li]C[Inego: Your bottom group is weak.]
;B[jn]C[Inego: Good!];W[ll];B[sl]C[Inego: Yose move, it should be left for the end.]
;W[sk];B[sm];W[rj];B[kk]LB[cc:A][em:B]C[Inego: What for? Doesn't threaten anything and is too far from friendly stones. Connecting at B was better, let alone the A move.]
;W[lk]C[Inego: You see now why 99 was bad. Black strengthened its territory and made your stone weak.]
;B[kj]LB[ki:A]C[Emoticon: Better at A?

Inego: No. Locally your move is better. Although I'd play bigger moves here, just leaving the stone.]
;W[ki];B[lj];W[mj];B[ji];W[kh]LB[jh:A]TR[lj][kj][kk]C[Inego: Here you chose to "protect" your territory above 106, but made attacking your triangle group easier. I'd connect at A.]
;B[kg];W[jh];B[ig];W[ih]
(;B[hh];W[ii];B[hi];W[ij]
(;B[dc]C[Inego: At last! :)];W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[db];W[ei];B[fh]
LB[fi:A]C[Inego: Why not at A?];W[jl]C[Emoticon: I considered this black group dead long time ago. Now that I write this it looks like it could have been saving by playing at k8 myself.

Inego: You are right. Your group is quite big at this stage of the game.]

(;B[mr]C[Emoticon: Variations shows that I still have use to the group mentioned above.

Inego: The variation showed that you gained just one point using that group.
Your 123 move could be punished by W (see var.)]
(;W[qn];B[rn];W[pn];B[ro];W[po];B[nr]C[Inego: You were lucky here to secure some points along the bottom. 

Emoticon: From this point on the game seemed to be frozen.

Inego: Your assertion is right, yose begins. Since the game is very close it is very important to use sente and make bigger moves here.]
;W[hj];B[ba];W[ab];B[km]LB[bj:A][em:B][aq:C]C[Inego: A and C are good sente moves (C is actually a double sente move), but the move at B prevents W from making at least 5 pts more in the center.]
;W[kl];B[em]C[Inego: Great! You saw the biggest move.];W[lg]
;B[lf];W[mg];B[mf];W[ng];B[df]C[Inego: Wrong, you lost sente by this move.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[dd];B[ca]C[Inego: Again, this moves gives you nothing, being gote as well.]
;W[be]C[Inego: W had nothing to be afraid of here.];B[bj]C[Inego: Great!]
;W[bi];B[fk];W[gi];B[gh];W[fi];B[hl];W[im];B[hm];W[lm];B[ln]
;W[mn];B[lo];W[io];B[jo];W[hs];B[is]LB[aq:A]C[Emoticon: Not the best hand now, right?

Inego: Actually, all sente moves are out now except for A. 163 is a sente move, so it's fine.]
;W[gs];B[aq]C[Inego: Great! Looks like yose is your talent :)]
;W[ar];B[ap];W[br];B[pa];W[qa];B[oa];W[dk]
(;B[dl]C[Emoticon: Variations with black at D10 seems better, unless I missed something.

Inego: Unfortunately, you did miss somethig (see my comment at your variation).]

[np][nq][oo][op][bq][br][bs][cq][cr][cs][ar][as]C[Emoticon [14k?\]: Thanks for the game.

Inego: Overall, I don't think you have any particular weak spots. The level of play you demostrated is surely above [14k\] so I think your progress will be fast. I have only to remind you the basic important points a beginner should have in his mind when playing:

1. Always watch for your weak groups and protect/save them before it is too late.
2. Watch for opponent's weak groups and attack them, especially if that strengthens your groups, gives you more influence or territory.
3. Look for big points.

I hope my comments will help you somehow to gain better understanding of Go and improve your results.]
