C[To the reviewer:

Thank you for reviewing my game.

The last few times I've had games reviewed, I've been told that I'm playing too passively.  Yet, as always seems to happen to me, whenever I attack (as I did at Q15, P4, and C12), things go badly wrong and I end up with terrible weaknesses.

One of the ways in which I've been told I'm playing passively is to try to get two eyes on the side, and that I shouldn't be afraid to run out into the center.  But what this game shows me is that whenever I try running into the center, my opponent is able to take a huge amount of territory along the side.

Obviously, I can't not attack, but I don't have any idea what to do differently.

Hi, I'm Tim (MatCauthon on KGS), and I'll be reviewing the game.  I'm about 6-7k, but I haven't been playing online enough lately to be sure.]

(;W[pe]C[Ted: I wonder if R10 or C11 wouldn't have been better.  At the very least, they couldn't have worked out as badly for me as the move I actually played.

I would greatly prefer R10.  Black would push you towards the top, but you would easily make a base.  See variation.]
;B[ph]C[Ted: This is where things started to go bad.  I approach my opponent, who plays a pincer attack, and I immediately get a weak position.  It happens to me all the time.]
;W[ne];B[nc]
(;W[qg]C[Ted: Make one eye on the side, and one in the center.

This probably isn't a good idea.  You can expect Black to strengthen his position below if you play this way.  How about attaching towards the center?  See variation.]

C[Ted: Obviously, if I don't attack Black, Black is going to get the entire bottom right quadrant of the board.  I can't allow that to happen.]
;B[mp]C[Ted: Unsurprisingly, Black plays another pincer attack.]

(;W[qq]C[Ted: I was worried that Black was going to respond with Q3, but considering how badly things went in the upper right, I had to try something different in the lower right.

You should absolutely jump out here.  See varations.]
(;B[rq];W[pq];B[qn]LB[rr:a]C[A is a very big move - It gives you an eye in sente.]
;W[on];B[pl]
(;W[nm]C[Here you're running out, but you aren't creating any eye space for yourself.  See variation.]
;B[nk];W[lm]C[Ted: Running out towards the center seems to be getting me nothing, but it's what stronger players say to do.]
;B[fq]C[Ted: Normally, I get criticized for playing too passively, but I attacked, and yet still ended up in deep trouble.

You got into a bad position because of what happened in the upper right.  After that, all you could do was invade the lower right, and try not to do too much damage to your position.]
;W[cn]C[Ted: Maybe I should have tried the pincer attack myself at H3.]
;B[dj];W[ch]C[Ted: I thought attacking the D10 stone was a good idea, but this too goes badly wrong.

That stone's too high to attack effectively right now, but a checking extension might be a good idea.  I would play this on the fourth line, though.]
;B[ce]C[Ted: I don't see how this move can be any better than my approaches at Q15 or P4, yet Black once again ends up with a strong position.

This position is fine for you.  It's the follow-up that goes wrong.  See variation.]

(;W[df];B[de]C[This is a disaster.];W[ee];B[ed]LB[dd:a]C[At this point, you're behind enough that you can't let this fight go Black's way.  I think you need to cut at A and hope for the best.]
;W[fe];B[cf];W[dg];B[dd]C[Ted: Now I've got a weak stone in the corner.

Just let it go.  There's no way it's worth it for you to live in the corner - Black will get strength on the outside.  If you play to seal Black in, things will turn out better for you.  See variation.]

(;W[cc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[db];B[gc];W[bd]C[Ted: I was trying to figure out a way to get two eyes in the corner.  I think I was lucky that Black didn't play B18.]
;B[id];W[bb];B[fj]C[I'm not so sure you needed to play at B18.  This hurts a lot.]
;W[fh]LB[hj:a]C[Ted: I wanted to make certain I could get some eyespace for this group, while putting pressure on the Black stones at D10 and F10.

If you take a look at the score at this point, White has 10 in the upper left, maybe 5 in the upper right, and maybe 10 in the lower left.  Black has 25 at the top, and a lot more on the right.  At this point you need to be much more aggressive if you're going to get back into the game.  How about A?  It will be very risky, but you have to do something drastic.]
;B[em];W[cl]LB[fo:a]C[You must keep Black separated to have a chance.  Something around A is required.]
;B[fo]C[Now the game is over.];W[jm]C[Ted: I didn't have any idea what to do here.  I thought about B10 to keep my groups on the left connected, and D3, but decided to try to strengthen my group in the bottom right and prevent Black from taking territory in the center in addition to what he's already got on the sides.]

This should be at A.  You shouldn't be too worried about eyes.  See variation.]
;B[mi];W[ki];B[lg];W[qd]C[Ted: I don't see how this group can make even one eye in the center, so I have to try to make two eyes on the side.

True, this is the group you should be worried about.];B[qc]

;B[os]C[Ted: I finally did some counting, and realized I was behind by a good 50 points, so I finally resigned.

From what you said above, I would say this game is a step in the right direction.  It sounds like up until now, you wouldn't invade in situation where you needed to.  Now you're invading when you need to, but it's going badly.  Now that you're getting practice with invading, you'll get better at it.  The main problem that I see with your invasions in this game is that you played moves near the edge that let Black get ahead of you in the center.  So you're getting into the center, which you need to do, but because Black is a move ahead, you get chased around a lot.  If you get ahead of Black in the center, things will be a lot easier for you.]

It's true that the ko isn't very good for you, but it's possible for Black to make a mistake before the ko and just die, and it's also possible that he will screw up the ko fight.  At this point, complications are your friend.]
