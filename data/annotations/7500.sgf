C[This game was played against MFoG using its 12k setting, with 0.5 komi.  Although I managed to win, I'm pretty sure I was losing for most of the game, and the victory was due in part to a lucky break near the end (somewhere around move 285).  So I am considering this a lost game and would like to have it reviewed so I can get stronger.  I have been playing Go casually for about 10 months now.]
;B[dq];W[qd];B[co];W[cc]C[Not used to seeing this opening and was unsure how to handle it.  Decided it would be bad to let him have both 3-3 and 4-4.


JR: This is a very conservative move. At your level you can bet good money that this is a mistake. Specific strategies are in place to make 3x3 successful. 

I would view this 3x3 move as an opportunity to advance faster elsewhere]

(;B[dd];W[qq]C[JR: See, now - he wants a corner. That's ok. Make sure he lives low.]
