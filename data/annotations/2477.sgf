C[Hi, I played W here, it was a close game. B had a big advantage until mid-game, where he made a mistake, causing the game to even out again. But in the end I couldn't win the game.

Can you point out at any time during the game where W can turn the tide and win the game?
Also, can you point me my main weaknesses?
In past reviews I was told that I am lack in focus. Do I still show that kind of lackness in this game?

What do you think, based on this game, the skills I should improve?

Thank you beforehand.

Exswoo[9k\]:Hi, I'll be reviewing your game.  I'll try to only concentrate on the main points :)]
;B[pd];W[dd]
(;B[pp];W[cp]LB[dq:A]C[This is my standard opening moves. Is it good to play a komoku or should I stick to the star points?
(i.e. is D4 better than C4?)

-Yes, D-4 is better than C-4, mainly because it strikes a better balance than C-4 does. If you want to play Komoku, it is also standard to play at A as well. Also, it's probably a better idea to play D-4 before D-16, because then you avoid the possibility of a split opening...see the var.

Yet at the same time, players in the 15k and up rarely win or lose games due to their opening moves, so it might be better for you to concentrate on the mid-game and fighting in general for now.]
;B[fc];W[dg]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[-That's quite a bit of a jump.  A or B is much more standard, mostly due to a possible attack here...see the var.]

(;B[dc];W[mp]C[-responding to D-17 is a good idea, since it is a big move.  Look at the var.]

(;W[mn]LB[oq:A]C[Ok, this may not be the best move. Can you recommend other moves that are better?

LB[gq:A]C[I love monkey jump =)

-perhaps, but A pincer at A is bigger.  The whole point of playing Komoku in the opening is to aim for a shimari, which didn't happen here.]

Is this where I should consider attacking that area?

-You could consider a reducing move or you can attack the E-3 stone.  Either way is fine but you really need to connect at A or your entire group is in danger.]

;W[ck];B[el];W[fj];B[ek]C[I was thinking of resigning here, because B top territorry is masive and I don't have anything that can be compared with that.
But, I decided to keep playing...

-I took a look until the end but since much of the come back you made was due to careless playing by your opponent, I think I'll end the play by play comments here.

Some general comments.

1)Don't make jumps whenever you can.  They may look like nice moves but remember that the solid connection is usually the best move defensively.

2)Play urgent moves before big moves.  You keep ignoring moves that lead to a possible invasion to play a large point on the map.  The possible gain of a large point pales in comparison to the definite loss of territory.

3)Don't tenuki just because your opponent does.  If it looks like you can hurt your opponent, keep playing in a local area even if your opponent plays somewhere else.

4)Don't atari for the sake of ataring.  Remember that ataris leads to your opponent connecting his stone, which makes it that much easier to defend.

Just keep those points in mind and I'm sure you'll rise with practice :)
