C[Hi

Thanks in advance to review my game.  I'm playing white in this game.

I played some games and I lost several games. So I ask you some questions:
1) how is the fuseki?
2)  see move 33. There is Black starting to invade. I loose much points again and again by this position. What is the good response or wht can I do to in advance?
3) Do you have some general hints for my playing.

Thanks again.

Jos


Hi, I'm Funaru, your reviewer. 
I'll mark my comments with an "F".];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[pj];W[jq];B[cj];W[jj]C[F: If there was a white stone on c10 or in that region this would build a large white moyo, but in this situation something around k17 seems much better. Surely it's good to cut the enemy's stones, but here it's rather useless, because you have to get a big moyo or attack black directly.]
;B[cf];W[ce]C[F: This is a slack move. It gives your enemy a strong position and your stones stay with searious weaknesses.
Attaching with a knight's move isn't good.];B[df];W[gc]C[F: You'll later have to defend your corner in gote. Black instead gained rather secure territory.]
;B[mq]C[F: I'd like to defend the left corner now. N4 aims on an invasion. Maybe a shimari?]

(;W[qg]C[F: Unorthodox attack, I as black, would anwer with R15.
I think O17 is a better point. Even if black gains a wall pointing at the bottom after the joseki, you will surely be able to reduce or invade somehow.]
;B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc]C[F: This is an endgame-move, you should first extend to s10.]
;B[rb];W[rj];B[qf];W[rf];B[qh]C[F: Now you should break through with q13. If you play defensively at s12, you are pressed down to the 2th line and you only get very few points, while your enemy gets a big wall to attack!]
;W[rh];B[pg];W[rg];B[pf];W[qe]C[F: R11 makes good shape.];B[qi]
;W[ri]C[F: Your enemy got a strong wall and you only a few points. That is not acceptable. Avert beeing pushed down to the first line, that's very bad.]
;B[cm];W[fp]C[F: Good.];B[hq]C[This is the point where I don't know good how to response. I loose again and againg some moyo. What can I do

F: I'd play G3 and secure the corner then with G2. After black counters you can jump to K5 for example.]

(;W[hp]C[F: This response was also ok so far, the mistakes happened later.]
;B[gp];W[gq]C[F: Quiet play at f3 is better. Sure, you lose some terretory, but you at least own the corner.]
;B[go]C[F: Now f3 and yor corner is rather save.
Extending to J4 is also possible, but that makes it a little complicated, see my variation.]

(;W[hr]C[F: If you attack so agressively, you leave too much cutting-points. Your enemy cuts and you lose more than if you played not so parlous.]
;B[fq];W[iq];B[ep]C[F: This ladder hurts...];W[eq]C[F: Black is able to play f2, too. D3 seems more solid.]
;B[fo]C[F: Even worse if black plays f3 instead.];W[er];B[fr]
C[F: Now you should be to be eager to defend the bottom left corner! It looks much weaker than the right side. 
Have a look at my variations.];W[ho];B[cq];W[dq]
(;B[cr];W[dp];B[do];W[bq];B[br];W[bo];B[co];W[bp];B[bn];W[ar]
;B[aq];W[ap];B[an];W[dr];B[gr]C[F: The ko is not soo important. H7 looks very nice, doesn't it?]
;W[hq];B[hn];W[in];B[hm];W[im];B[hl];W[fj]C[F: Not a bad point,  but black can play H10 and then you are divided an black con force you around.]
;B[ei];W[gh]C[F: H10 is better, because it can't be threatened to cut so easily.
J9 also looks well.];B[fi];W[hk]C[F: Crude Move, no effect on the enemy, he cann now attack with J8 and your stones are divided successfully.
G10 or J10 look much more certain.];B[il];W[fl]C[F: You wanted too much. Your shape is very weak at the moment, and you'd do better to defend your stones.]
;B[gj];W[gk];B[ej];W[fk];B[gi];W[ij]C[F: You were very lucky with this reducing. Black lost a lot points.]
;B[jl];W[lo];B[fm];W[op]C[To attach is not so good here, because black is now an attack-move ahead and in addition to that he has two stones there and you  one with only two liberties left.

A 3-3-invasion or something around r6 seems reasonable.];B[oq]
;W[oo];B[po];W[lq];B[mp];W[mo];B[lp];W[kp]C[F: As you can see: Your enemy's shape became strong by your attaching. Now his corner is rather save.]
;B[jn];W[jo];B[jm];W[io]C[F: This is rather small, M2 is much bigger.]
;B[lr];W[kr];B[kq]C[F: Fighting the ko can't end too bad, don't be afraid trying it!]
;W[jr];B[on];W[nn];B[np];W[no];B[om];W[qn];B[ql];W[pn]C[Too diffident by black - Something around R4 abandon white's try to survive.]
;B[pl];W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[pq];W[ro];B[rq];W[rl];B[rk]C[F: S7 is far better. This play made it easy for you.]
;W[qk];B[rm];W[sk];B[qm];W[sm];B[rn]C[F: Black was afraid of the ko, but he dosn't has to. The ko is good for him, 'cause he has nothing to lose, but you.]
;W[sn];B[qo];W[sq];B[qr];W[so];B[pk];W[qj];B[de]C[F: Now you see why attaches should be answered directly..]
;W[kc]C[F: To cover the corner is more urgent! Furthermore you should play very save here with small extensions, because your group in the middle doesn't live unconditionally.]
;B[ic];W[cd]C[F: But now black can attack l17 very effektively.]
;B[ie]C[F: L17 is cut off now and the group in the middle looks very poor.]
;W[hf];B[he];W[ge];B[hh];W[ih];B[gg];W[hg];B[fh];W[jg];B[ke]
;W[hi];B[gh];W[gf]C[F: You were very lucky here, it had not been too difficult to cut off the J10-stones...]
;B[ff];W[mi];B[oi];W[oh]C[F: Not good, if black plays O12, your stone is probably dead.]
;B[ph];W[nh];B[mf];W[lf];B[le];W[me];B[md];W[mg];B[nf];W[lg]
;B[ib];W[ek];B[dk];W[en]C[F: This peep is rather useless, if black plays e7, there is nothing to fear for him.]

(;B[eo];W[em];B[fn];W[dl];B[cl];W[fe];B[ee];W[ed];B[be];W[bd]
;B[bg];W[ll]C[F: First A15 or T18 or S2 which are sente. G18 seems big, too.]

;B[ld];W[ia];B[ja]C[F: Even there is a stone at L17, you have to defend the atari.]
;W[jb];B[ha];W[hd];B[id];W[gd];B[ga];W[fa];B[ia];W[fb];B[ad]
;W[ac];B[ae];W[bc]C[F: Now black got the nice sente-moves you could have had.]
;B[dm];W[bh]C[F: This is an overplay. There is no place for living. I belive even a 25k might be able to kill your stones... Moves like this  one are not very polite.]
;B[ch];W[ag];B[bf];W[el]C[F: There are still more important points than this ko.]
;B[dn];W[fs];B[es]C[F: Throw-in is useless here...];W[ds];B[gs]

;W[ms];B[ns];W[ks];B[or]C[F: Also unnecessary.];W[lq]C[F: Kos are only worth maximal one point, there are still left some better places to play, such als T18.]

Recapitulating Suggests:

Now I comment your questions.

I played some games and I lost several games. So I ask you some questions:

1) how is the fuseki?

F:
 Your fuseki is quite ok for your grade, but there is one  important thing you should take to heart:

- Don't Invade to early! In this game black became very strong, because of your rather ineffective invasion in the middle of the fuseki. So the fuseki ended aprupt and your enemy gained the initiative.


2)  see move 33. There is Black starting to invade. I loose much points again and again by this position. What is the good response or what can I do to in advance?

F: See the comments and variations at that point. 


3) Do you have some general hints for my playing.

F: 
- Don't play attach-moves if you don't want your enemy becoming strong. Attach moves are only good if  
a) you have a weak group and want to get a secure shape, without important getting much points.
b) you want to get a strong position and it makes no odds if your enemy also besomes strong.

- Never attach strong groups, or your group become weaker than before.

-Be careful in the fuseki and endgame, take the time you need to find reasonable moves! 

-Don't invade, if you haven't powerfull groups on the board, be careful not to get several weak groups.



You played an interesting game. If you keep on playing and maybe read some books, you'll soon become much  stronger. :)
