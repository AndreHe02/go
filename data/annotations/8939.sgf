(;B[rr]C[Aha! You've fallen for white's greedy trick; this block is too slow. If black always responded this way, the push would be joseki. See variation]

LB[dj:A]C[I played J3 to shrink opponents territory, was it a good/strong move? What would have been better?

Your idea is good, but white's group is too safe to threaten/attack, so your move is not so big. I would prefer A]

Fixing the cut like this is a little slow, but it makes you pretty thick. See variation.]
;W[ko];B[lp]C[I never playtested this move before, but i've seen it being used every once in a while.

No reason to peep like this: it sometimes is an effective way to remove white space, but white is already too strong for that. As a result, your strengthen white.]

I don't think so given the weaknesses; you're lucky you didn't get seki. This connect at the end is way too slow though.]

;B[ha];W[ia];B[sa]C[Fuumaa1133 resigned here, when looking at the Score Estimate, it estimated my victory by 30ish points. What could I learn from this game? What is my playing style? What players should I study from? What games should I study from? What are the mistakes in my moves? Do you feel that I won because of the five stone handicap? Is there anything else you can say that will help me improve, or just any comments in general?

Thank you very much for reviewing my game!

So, I think the biggest mistakes you made were your weird contact plays: the pointless wedges between white's one point jumps and moves like f3 and r13. Also, you left a very severe cutting point at H7 for a while. You missed a chance to kill white's upper left corner uncoditionally, and you should have pressured white's two stones on the left side.

On the other hand, you pretty succesfully pressed white down, and managed to build thickness while compressing white's territory. Good use of handicap stones! You probably could have handled this game with 4 stones.

Remember to not wedge unless you can cut, and remember that touching stones strengthens them. Contact plays are more useful when you're trying to make shape for yourself. Pressuring/attacking groups with touching them is very useful!

I'm not very knowledgable about pros, but when I was about 5k I started studying pro games. Before that, I think playing more of your own games against stronger opponents with review is the most fun/helpful. I like the way you question your moves, seems like a good way of tihnking.]
