Hello, 

My name is Rogerio and I will be your reviewer for this evening. 

Every time you see a "R>" it will be me. 

Hope you enjoy.];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[ec];W[qe];B[qd];W[pe]
;B[mc];W[pi];B[cj];W[jp];B[eq];W[ep];B[hq]C[R> Well this is unusual, the two point jump on the third line is only surely connected IF the stones are not in harm´s way. This looks like a SUPER overplay to me. The best way would be to F4 and establish a base of somesort before trying to live.]
;W[fq];B[er]C[R>];W[fr];B[fp];W[es]
(;B[eo]C[R> Wrong side!!!!! D4 gives you a fighting chance. (see a quick variation) 

Of course if you WANTED to get the outer rim with the white corner enclosed the try was a good one, BUT it is the wrong thing to do. Clearly the corner is worth much more than you can expect to gain in the outside, because H3 will be a burden to you and that means the side will be white´s also. 

The thing to get used to seeing here is this: not always letting your opponent get the corner and the sides is a bad thing, an invasion on your opponents moyo is only effective if the invading stones live, or by way of threating to live them you can diminish your opponent´s moyo. losing the invasion stones in gote is like passing.]
;W[dp];B[fo];W[dr];B[cn]C[I think my stone should have been placed one line above where I played.

R> Well I think this is ok, if you had played at C7, white would have D6 for a cutting point. But this hole mess is terrible for black since the stone at H3 is now dead. I see that the best move here should be H5 making some sort of chance for the invasion to take away points from white.]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[gq];B[ho];W[ip];B[jn];W[cl]C[I have problems dealing with Invasions, and contact fighting. I think is due to my playing automatically without thinking out each move.

R> Well then you should try to give them a look, invasions will always happen in Go. and invasions like this, inside your influence should be dealt with extreme punishment. there is no way you can let a stone like C8 live, if you do you are not thinking straight, you have ENORMOUS, I mean REALLY HUGE influence in that area, C8 is the closest you can get to a sacrifice in japanese rules ;), since you said you are not good at them you should try to see my variations, but remember that killing is not always the most PROFITABLE play, but sometimes it is NECESSARY.]

First: you said you are playing too fast. That is a great defect!! You must stop at once! If you are playing on the internet a good help is to always take your hand off the mouse when you have played a move. 

Second: you have many problems of reading, the worst of all is your inability to connect and to make decisions on life and death. My advice is this: problems of life and death are a must for you. There are lots of books out there and a lot of sites that have free problems on them, go and imerse yourself for a while, it often is what is necessary to see connections also, so you would be killing both birds with the same rock ;) 

Any other questions or comments feel free to send me an e-mail.
