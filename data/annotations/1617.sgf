LB[lc:B][nc:A]C[reid: I brought this game to our group lessons with Jiang Ming Jiu (7p), so most of the comments are his.

Ming Jiu: The usual move here is one line lower at A(O17).  O16 leaves too much aji, so black has a natural approach at B (M17), for example.]
;B[ph];W[re]LB[oc:A][qc:D][od:B][pd:C][rd:F][rf:E]C[Ming Jiu:  White S15 is a problem in that it invites the sequence: black A (P17), w B (P16), b C (Q16,),  w D (R17), b E (S14), w F (S16).  White is left with some bad aji...]
;B[qh]LB[rf:A][ni:B]C[Ming jiu:  If black chooses not to play A (S14), then he should instead play at B (O11) to make shape.  Later, R12 becomes a wasted move.]
;W[rf];B[oc];W[od];B[pd];W[qc];B[jc]C[Ming Jiu:  The sequence from black 15 (P17) is aji-keshi.  Black should simply play at A (M17) instead.]
;W[lc]LB[og:B][pg:A][oh:C]C[Ming jiu:  Instead, white gets M17, but white has missed a chance here.  Now is the time to push and cut with A (Q13), black B (P13, white C (P12).]
;B[nh]LB[pg:C][oh:D][ni:A][qn:B]TR[jc][lc]C[did black lost in this opening?

Ming Jiu: Black's shape point is A (O11) instead of O12.  O11 is a bit cramped.  However, since the triangled stones have already been exchanged (K17 and M17), black can instead play at B (R6).  If white pushes up with C (Q13),  black plays D (Q12) and sacrifices four stones in exchange for well-placed thickness.]
;W[cf]LB[fc:A]TR[jc]C[Ming Jiu:  Wrong direction!  An invasion at A (F17) isolates the marked stone (K17) and starts a fight in white's favor.]
;B[fd];W[dj]LB[ci:A]C[Ming Jiu:  In this game, it is already too late to try to build a moyo (for either side), so white should instead play at A (C11) to get a stable base.]
;B[cl]LB[dh:A]C[Ming Jiu:  A natural response.  Now a black play at A (D12) is severe, since it cuts the two white stones.]
;W[fq]LB[dh:A]C[Ming Jiu:  Dangerous, since the threat of black A (D12) lingers.  If white loses sente here, he will be in trouble in the upper left.]
;B[hq];W[cq]LB[dh:A]TR[nh]C[reid:  This may seem natural, but it plays into black's game.  Outside thickness for black will work well with the threat of A (D12) and the marked (O12) stone.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn];B[dn];W[bn]
;B[el]LB[dh:A][np:B]C[Ming Jiu: Now black has two good moves:  the attack at A (D12) and the extension to B (O4).]
;W[bd]LB[dg:A]C[Ming Jiu:  This only solves part of the problem.  Black could play A (D13) for example, and build some serious thickness which would work well with his other stones.]
;B[cc];W[bc]LB[ef:A]C[is b17 too slow? or b10 better than b17?

reid: or perhaps A (E14).  This group just doesn't have a good feel about it.  White seems to be scrambling to survive instead of living gracefully and naturally.]
;B[nq]LB[kp:B][np:A]C[Ming Jiu: black gets his other good choice, but the high move at A (O4) would balance better with his other stones.

reid: White might reduce black with a pincer around B (L4)]
;W[qn];B[no]LB[np:A]C[reid:  However, white allows black to do even better than A (O4) :-)]
;W[iq]C[reid:  Dangerous to go so deep, especially so close to black's thickness.]
;B[ip]C[reid: Natural response.];W[hp];B[gq]LB[jq:A][hr:C][ir:B]
C[Ming Jiu: Black should atari at A (K3), if white B (J2), black C (H2) and white cannot kill the two black stones, so white is going to have a hard time in this fight.]
;W[jp]LB[lo:A][kq:C][lq:B]C[Ming Jiu: Bad aji-keshi here.  Instead, white should play lightly at A (M5), for example.  If black B (M3) then white C (L3) should work pretty well.  If black plays anything else, then white B (M3) starts a good fight,]
;B[io];W[jo];B[in];W[jn];B[im]C[reid: White has forced black to take the territory on the left, and now there is no aji left for white to use.]
;W[mp];B[np];W[kl];B[nl]LB[nm:A]C[reid: This is an overplay.  A (O7) is good enough.]
;W[mq]C[is L10 better than n3?

Ming Jiu:  A (J2) or B (Q3) are both better.

reid: N4 was a forcing move, so trying to make something of it by playing N3 is the wrong idea.  If black gets K3, it is very big and painful for white.]
;B[qq];W[pq];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[nr];B[ro];W[on]LB[nm:A]TR[nl]
C[reid:  A bit later, I mentioned to Ming Jiu about the marked stone (O8) being an overplay.  He responded "But it's OK, because white can help black fix it." :-)

Ming Jiu: Instead of P6, white can attack everything by attaching at A (O7).]
;B[lm]C[Ming Jiu: ??];W[jm]LB[nn:A]C[Ming Jiu:  Why not just push at A (O6) and take three stones?

reid:  taking three stones settles all white's problems in this area and is very big,]
;B[nn];W[rn];B[qo]C[Ming Jiu:  Bad move!  Why?

reid: (None of us got the answer.  First try to find the good move, then take a look at the variation.)]

(;W[po]C[Ming Jiu:  Black is still not alive in the corner.]
;B[pm]C[Ming Jiu: ??];W[pn]LB[pk:E][ol:B][pl:C][om:A][qp:D]
C[Ming jiu:  White missed a chance to finish the game here.  White should instead push out at A (P7).  If black B (P8), white C (Q8).  Black still has to live with D (R4), and white E (Q9) would be too hard for black to handle.]
;B[qp]TR[om]C[can b cut at p3 instead of r4?

reid: Black can cut, yes, but it looks like his aji is too bad - I doubt he could do any serious damage to white.  In any case, black's corner dies pretty fast, so black needs R4.

tf: One final question if you don't mind: how different among the timing of black cutting at P3 in move 73, 75 or 77?
In another word, is it still good for black to cut at P3 in move 75 or 77?

reid: The beauty of P3 at move 73 is that it saves the corner already - black doesn't need another move.  Once black exchanges R5 for Q5, he needs another move to save his corner.  So he loses a tempo (chess term: he has to make an extra move) if he leaves it too long.  If black tries to cut at 75, the corner might die.  But even if white doesn't kill the corner, he gets an extra move when black defends, so the severity of the P3 cut is greatly reduced.]
;W[om];B[ol];W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[pk];W[qj]LB[pl:B][nm:C][qm:A]
C[Ming Jiu: white should double-atari at A (R7) first.  This is a fighting technique: the timing is critical.  Black almost has to connect at B (Q8) to keep white from getting eyes too easily, so black's liberties are reduced, and the cut at C (O7) is more severe.  If white plays A (R7) after R10, black will tenuki (since white is alive anyway).]
;B[ch]C[reid:  This is as far as we analyzed the game.  I think the amazing part here is just how much a pro sees that us amateurs completely miss.  And I'm sure there are deeper layers that he skipped over because they're too subtle for us.

On the other hand, everything Ming Jiu pointed out was very obvious and completely pragmatic.  One could even say it's simple.  But seeing all this during a game is the tricky part.]

(;AE[qo]C[reid:  Clearly black needs another stone in the corner to live.  So how does he go about getting it?  Got the answer yet?]
;B[oq]LB[jr:C][lr:A][mr:B]TR[on][qn][rn][pp][pq]C[reid:  Cut!  This is really quite beautiful.  Not only does it solve black's corner problem, but it isolates the marked stones (R6 group) and threatens black A (M2), white B (N2), black C (K2).  White would be hard pressed to make both groups live.]
