C[Hi there dear reviewer, thank you for taking the time to review my game.

This game was played on Dragon Go and the ranks in the SGF aren't accurate.  I have been told recently by a 2 dan that I was around 3-4 kyu (however, I don't think that my performance in this game bears me out) and my opponent told me he was 7kyu KGS.

My main problem (to my knowledge) is deciding how to attack a group and knowing when to try to kill it (if they're just being too greedy) vs try to corral it.  Any pointers in this area would be greatly appreciated, as my major problem this game was mishandling my opponent's weak group and then running him through my territory.

This game goes all of the way to the end and the difference is a half point win for me.  Though I do not think I deserved it.  Despite that the game remains close the entire way through and there are more than a few interesting exchanges.

My endgame is poor, and any pointers in this area would be appreciated as well.

Hagios: This was a lucky game for white!  I've done my best to respond to your questions and offer other thoughts when appropriate.]
;B[qd]C[cole romeo (cole): Hello, nice to meet you.];W[dp]C[Michael Reilly (OmnipotentEntity): Hello there, have a good game.

If you're really a 16 kyu, I won't bully you, and I'd be more than happy to explain my reasoning for each move.]
;B[pq]C[cole romeo (cole): I am 7 Kyu on kgs because I improved faster than my dgs rank could do as the games last long. I would prefer you play full force and we discuss that way if I don't understand]
;W[dd]C[Michael Reilly (OmnipotentEntity): Then you're right around my rank.  This should be fun.]
;B[oc]C[cole romeo (cole): Right on, good luck ;)];W[po]LB[pn:B]
[qn:A]C[H: I prefer A or B for this approach, giving black less leeway in attacking.]
;B[qo]LB[pl:A][ql:B]C[H: A or B work better as pincers, allowing black to work with the shimari in the north.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[nq];W[qi];B[qg]C[I was also considering a move around K17, would that have been better in this case?

H: I prefer splitting the right in the shape at 5, but I think your method was a bit too close.]
;W[oi]LB[dj:A]C[H: This prevents an invasion, but gives up an important sente.  I would have played at A without hesitation here.]
;B[cj];W[jc];B[cf]C[1]
(;W[df];B[dg];W[ce];B[ef];W[de];B[cg];W[fd]C[This exchange seemed a bit awkward as far as shape is concerned.  Black's C10 stone seems too close, and white's shape is... funky.

H: c10 is a bit close, but black is sente.  What's more, your ability to later jump from f16 is reduced--black's e14 stone is doing more work than your d14 and d15 stones combined.  See the variation at 17]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[ej]C[Looking back at this move it seems wrong.  I probably should have just taken the 33 and allowed D8.  But I remember not wanting to do that because black's shape would be too good.

H: 3,3 in this shape is not necessarily good.  Please see the variation for an explanation.]
(;B[dk]LB[db:29][mc:D][qc:18][df:B][oi:A][bj:20][qk:15][ep:2]
[cq:C][rr:15]C[H: This feels soft, and does not make many points for black.  We can count territory now to get an idea of how the game stands, and formulate our plans.

We can see that black is probably very slightly ahead here, but is gote.  We can blame A and B for that.

Now that we have been given a free move by black, I would consider C or perhaps D.

See the variation for another way for black to consider.];W[ek]

(;W[br]C[H: This is falling into a trap.];B[dr];W[er]C[This move doesn't help the situation if I'm reading it out correctly.  Black C2 can still kill off white's B2 stone, I think black didn't play it because it was too small right now.

H: Correct.  b2 was the mistake.];B[kp]C[H: Black's lead increases]
;W[je]C[This move seems slow, I think N17 might have been better?  What are your thoughts?

H: I would prefer n17.  You must be expansive when behind.]

;B[fl];W[el];B[hl]C[From here I have a weak group of black's to attack.  My intention was to attack from the top to push black right and aim at the E13 cut.]
;W[hj];B[ik];W[ij];B[jk];W[ki];B[fn];W[fo];B[im];W[fg]C[I probably should have cut directly.

H: "Don't peep at cutting points!" - a proverb];B[eg];W[fh]
LB[el:A]C[H: This move, and the move at A are examples of kikashi moves where you've spent an extra move without any real benefit.  This is a habit to get rid of.]
;B[lc];W[kn]C[I thought that black's move at the top was too greedy and that he should be worrying about his weak group, but I think I pushed in the wrong direction.  A better move would be M8 probably?

Because thickness won't help me attack black's bottom much, it's so solid.]

Michael Reilly (OmnipotentEntity): Wow... holy shit that was close.
cole romeo (cole): Ya, I was not expecting that, great game

White: 42 territories + 2*21 dead stones(B) + 12 prisoners + 6.5 komi = 102.5
Black: 72 territories + 2*6 dead stones(W) + 18 prisoners = 102
Result: W+0.5

H: White was lucky in this game, and komi saved the day.  I recommend some books on fighting strategy, as well as endgame moves.  At a certain point, endgame is simply math; not much required beyond that except tesuji when it's appropriate.]
