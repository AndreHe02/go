;B[qp]C[grubar: hello liontea];W[cd]C[liontea [-\]: hi there
grubar: good game to you!];B[dp];W[qd]C[liontea [-\]: yes same to you gg
grubar: ar you beginner?
liontea [-\]: yep only been playing for 3 weeks];B[jp]C[grubar: ok let's see !]
;W[oq];B[pq];W[op];B[qn]C[should have defended at n3 i think

TheSarge: Your response is fine here, is joseki move];W[kq]
;B[mq]C[TheSarge: I might play this at K3 instead, build up your left corner, it will be hard to actually kill whites stones here]
;W[mp]C[TheSarge: Now instead of attacking him, with this one move he has put you on the defensive. You have to save N3 while he builds himself up.]
;B[nq];W[np];B[or];W[lq];B[nr]C[TheSarge: Whenever you get an empty triangle shape, it usually means you are doing something wrong. Here notice that even if he played at O2, you would be fine.]
;W[kp];B[jq];W[kn];B[jn]C[TheSarge: Dont feel that you always need to match your opponent move for move. Always check the whole board to see if there is anything bigger you can play.]
;W[oc];B[ec];W[dc];B[ed];W[cg];B[hd]C[TheSarge: I would probably play this somewhere like J17 or H17 instead, this leaves you pretty open on the right, and gives white a perfect move that attacks your weak group and expands his top right corner strengthening his group at the same time.]
;W[ic];B[kc]C[g 17 better

TheSarge: Whites move is exactly what we are afraid of, and now you are attacked from both sides. I would probably defend at H17 here.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[hc];B[id];W[eb]C[TheSarge: He now has the entire top pretty solidly, and you need to capitalize on the strength you've made towards the middle]
;B[fe];W[fc];B[fd]C[TheSarge: Two empty triangles in one move. This is where you should have made some big move expanding your territory.]
;W[jd];B[kd]C[TheSarge: You are just going to push white into your expansion territory now.]
;W[je];B[fq]C[TheSarge: This is a better move that completely solidifies the entire corner for you]
;W[mc];B[le]C[should giive up L17, L16 and try to work towords an eye at J15

TheSarge: Right idea, although J15 is too close. Don't make empty triangles, instead make some breathing room. Maybe G13?]
;W[ke];B[ld];W[jc];B[lf];W[jg]C[have helped white develop and now have to try to save two groups so am behind

TheSarge: right. Now your wall of strength has turned into a weak blob with no eyes]
;B[jf]C[TheSarge: You need bigger moves to get eye space.];W[if]
;B[kf]C[am];W[hg];B[fg];W[ff];B[gf];W[ef];B[gg];W[eg];B[hf]
;W[ie];B[he]C[TheSarge: Be careful here, you are creating an eye, but allowing to almost completely cut off all chance of escape at G12]
;W[gh];B[dd];W[cc];B[fh];W[eh];B[hh]C[TheSarge: Nice catch here.]
;W[ig];B[gi];W[ih];B[ei];W[hi];B[dj];W[gh];B[dm];W[gj];B[fi]
;W[hh];B[gm]C[TheSarge: Dont forget about your group at M16, you may want to play there first, theres lost of points to win or lose there.]
;W[ck];B[cl]C[TheSarge: I'd be very careful about how I responded here, you could easily put your F11 group back in danger.]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[cj];B[lh]C[trying to save  L17group should let them die and play F10 to make life]
;W[bl];B[bm];W[dl];B[cm];W[el];B[fk];W[fl]
(;B[fj]C[D11 is better for white to kill eye

TheSarge: Maybe play at G9 instead (see variation)];W[gk];B[di]
;W[gl];B[fm]C[TheSarge: Much too small again. Play up top and save your other group]
;W[il];B[im]C[TheSarge: What about at M10 or something? Again, dont feel like you need to match him exactly.]
;W[in];B[io];W[hn];B[gn]C[TheSarge: I might play this at K7 instead. See the empty triangle again? You are getting too clumped up in the corner, and you need to make some gains in the center now to come back.]
;W[jm];B[jo];W[hm];B[ho]C[TheSarge: There are bigger moves out there!]
;W[em];B[en];W[go]C[dont see F7 group in atari];B[fo];W[fn]
;B[ep]C[G4 is better

TheSarge: probably];W[gp];B[gq];W[hp];B[hq];W[bk];B[ir]C[i am not sure if this move does anything

TheSarge: Right. Dont worry about completely solidifying everything here just yet, go for big moves.]
;W[am];B[an];W[al];B[bo]C[B5  to defend A6];W[qh];B[ng]C[trying to save L17 group  but makes and akward triangle shape that cant easily make an eye L13 makes a potential eye better?
should extend corner with R10 instead
i think this is where i lost

TheSarge: Right, I would extend from the bottom and connect]
;W[pk];B[ql]C[TheSarge: Would expand out from M12 again here probably.]
;W[qk];B[pl];W[ol];B[pm];W[om];B[pn]C[TheSarge: Bad shape here. Maybe P6]
;W[on];B[po]C[TheSarge: Big moves!!];W[oj];B[mh]C[N13 better at L13 but still not easily able to make and eye]
;W[kj]C[this move almost seems like he knows i wont live so he wants me to waste stones or is just securing his moyo(i think right word)

TheSarge: Things are probably gunna be difficult here for you.]
;B[kg];W[ki];B[kh]C[TheSarge: This move should probably be at O15 or something. L12 does not do much for you]
;W[mf];B[nf];W[me];B[mg]C[net at O16 looks better but is pointless]
;W[md];B[ni];W[oh];B[li];W[mj];B[jb];W[lb];B[kb];W[ib];B[la]
;W[ma];B[ja];W[ka];B[og];W[pg];B[pf];W[oe];B[nj];W[nk];B[oi]
;W[pi];B[qg];W[ph];B[qe];W[rf];B[ne];W[nd];B[lj];W[lk];B[la]
C[TheSarge: For this whole sequence, try to read ahead at least a move or two. This was a difficult group to save, but you should only try moves that you cant see an obvious counter for. Open moves where you're not sure what will happen are better than moves you are sure will fail.]

C[seems like i need to sacrifice stones if they are pointless and stop attacking when i should defend?
