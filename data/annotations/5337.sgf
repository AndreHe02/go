C[I am B, this is a game on KGS, W is 8k, B is 9k

A: Hello, My name is Andreas, I was about 3k on KGS when I last played there half a year ago. I used CGoban2 for editing, and my comments were marked with A: 

A: I got the feeling that B got out ahead during the opening, but obviously lost during the middle game. 

A: Your biggest problem in this game was finding the correct direction for attacking. Attacking to kill is normally futile, and the crucial point in attacking is finding the right direction to build territory while attacking, and ending the attack to complete it before the opponent can tenuki. 

A: The game was of course lost after Your opponent captured Your upper side group. Remember Shygosts list (should be known to a KGS player): 
1. Take care of Your own weakness
2. Attack Your opponents weakness
3. Take big points

A: In the opening, You played tenuki to build Your framework while Your opponent build a thick formation in the lower left. Even though Your opponent played too slow, remember that having thick groups allows Your opponent to invade deeply without much worries.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[kq]C[A: Mini-Chinese, a very common fuseki recently]
;W[eq]
(;B[pj]LB[fp:A]C[I wasn't sure about this tenuki, Q10 is certainly big, but F4 hurts my F3 in a very bad way.

A: Playing F4 is necessary in my opinion, it makes whites kosumi look bad.]
;W[gq]LB[fp:A]C[A: strange move, F4 looks more normal.]
(;B[fc]C[I decided to tenuki again, if he wants to spend a bunch of moves killing F3, just let him

A: good decision. B can get no good result in the lower left anymore, so its probably best to tenuki.]
;W[fp]C[A: overkill]
(;B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[ce]C[A: bad move by W, the outside is more important]
;B[ef];W[de]
(;B[eg]LB[fd:A][fe:B]C[A: w can attach at A to get out, so it might be better for w to play B]
;W[ec]LB[fd:A]C[A: Better at A];B[fd]C[A: W is doing B a big favor by giving B an outside wall facing the B Moyo]
;W[ch]C[A: If w wants to connect under, he should play b13. This move looks bad]
;B[cg]C[A: correct];W[ci]C[A: w is extremely overconcentrated on the left side now.]

(;B[mc]LB[kd:A]C[A: Top is biggest, but I would have played L16 for a splendid moyo.]
