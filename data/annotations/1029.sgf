C[First I want to thank you, whoever you are  for reviewing this game
It has been played on IGS Between Me  (ShereKahn W 30k, and GROEN 26k*, IGS  rankings)
My name is Dimitris Regginos and I play  in IGS as "guitarist" and as "regginos".
It is my pleasure to do a review and I will  do my best to be helpfull.]
;B[pp];W[ce];B[pd];W[cp];B[dd]C[In the next few moves I manage to hold  the corner but as it seems from the end of  the game that I got pushed into to easily,  how should I better respond to the next  few moves ?
If your intention was to take the corner  you shouldn't have played c15: a stone at  the 3-5 point is aiming at the side rather  than the corner. To take the corner you  must prefare 3-3. 3-4 also aims at the  corner but it leaves the possibility to  attack at 4-3.
Please, note that 3-5 is not a bad move at  all! It is not the move I am critisizing but  your comment.]
;W[cd]C[I think, this is ok.
Black's attack at d16 is rather strange:  c17 or d17 are more usual.]
;B[de];W[dc];B[cf]C[Bad! e17 was the only move for black!]
(;W[bf]LB[df:a]C[I don't like this. I think "a" was better.]
;B[cg];W[bg]C[This is again too low. The second line  is called "the line of defeat". e17 was  better.]
;B[ec]LB[cc:a]C[Now white should play "a"];W[db];B[eb]MA[cc]
[be]LB[bc:a][ef:b]TR[pd]C[You are allowing your opponent to  build an outside wall in return for  corner profit. White still needs a move  to protect the cutting points marked "x"  and black will use his move to  strengthen his wall (cutting points  marked "diamond").
 A white stone at "a" would make  perfect shape in the corner, while "b"  would make a very thick and strong  wall facing the triangled stone.]

C[Well here I don't know to well how to  respond, was there a way to stay  'connected' on the left side ?

You don't need to stay connected at  the left side! Both groups are strong  enough even separated.]
;W[bp];B[ao];W[ap];B[ei]C[White is already in bad situation. You  should try to complicate the game. You  need to enter your opponent's huge  potential territory.
Your opponent should gladky let you  take a part of it keeping the bigest part  of it and winning the game.]
;W[am]C[I think you know what I have to say  about such moves :-)]
;B[bn]MA[qg][pg][qm][kd]C[Moves like the ones marked are  possible. Black needs to remember  that he must complicate the game to  have a chance.]
;W[pc];B[nd]C[Ater letting your opponent make such  wall and making all right side his  potential territory, the game is  completely lost.]

Black will need many BIG errors from  white's side to have a chance.]

Black wins by 38.5.

Well How did I behave ? Was my  playing  not too bad ? What are my  obvious weaknesses, and how should  I Try to correct them?

Thanks again for your comments.

You must try to see the board as a  whole. Look for the big moves. "Sente"  is also important.

Study games of strong opponents. Try  to understand the purpose of their  moves.
Read some good books on GO.])
