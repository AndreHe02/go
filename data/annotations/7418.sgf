C[To my dear reviewer.

Hello, and thanks for having my game review. In this game I'm black, and i had the feeling i should have won this game.

Can you tell me what are my major leaks in the opening ? (does my sense of the direction of play is totally wrong ?)

And what are my mistakes in the game ?

Thanks to help me improve my game !

Hi, I'm your reviewer LibraryEx 3k KGS. I'll try my best to answer your questions along the way. please bear in mind that i'm only a self-taught 3k, so it'll be best if you can get someone else to go through my review with you. do mail me if you have any questions!]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[cn]C[generally you should try to avoid having a komoku facing the opponent. a simple way to test your opening is to use the simplest joseki. in this case, with a komoku facing the opponent, and if the simplest joseki is played, this will occur:]

(;W[fp]
(;B[dk]C[chicken move. since white went for a bigger move than usual (F4 instead of F3), it will be much less secure, so the corner is invadable.

in this case, if you play out one of the possible josekis...]

(;W[nq]
(;B[lq]C[Here I'm not sure the pincer is the best answer, but i didn't wanted white to get a huge bottom with D4 and F4.

the pincer is a right strategic response. you are right. if you had allowed white to take the entire bottom side so easily, you will probably lose.]

i would rather defend the R16 komoku. the F17 move is low and hard to attack, so...]

;B[nr];W[ic]C[slow move...];B[qj]C[nice move. but the flaw in the huge R16 corner is dangerous.]

(;W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[nn]C[nice. white is disadvantaged, since he cant expand due to your R10 stone.]
;W[om];B[oj];W[ql]C[umm, lol? slower than frozen snail.];B[oe]
C[Is it a too early move ? L17 is maybe better to construct a moyo in the upper right corner ?

i've never really seen this move before... so i don't really know.]
;W[nm];B[mn];W[lc]
(;B[me]C[slow. since white is low at the top, you should press down on him]
;W[ke];B[gf]C[ouch. this is inconsistant. you might have done better to block at M13.]

(;B[cp]C[i would prefer B4. 1 less point, but sente];W[cq];B[eo]
C[is it a mistake ? i wanted to wall off and work with my thickness upside to make big territory, and threat the white corner.

too hasty. you should have a list of priorities, do you want the corner, or the outer influence? if you try for both, you get neither. also white's N12 move looks like a painful reduction.]
;W[do];B[dn];W[co];B[ep];W[eq];B[fo];W[go];B[gn];W[gp];B[fm]
C[Maybe overprotective ?

its fine i guess. but you should be careful of the H4, H6 weak points. without this move, F6 is also threatened.]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[hp];B[ip];W[io];B[hn];W[jo];B[jp];W[pk];B[pj]
C[Too defensive ? i have the bad habit to always connect when someone peep...

as a rule of thumb, when someone peeps, block. if you can't find any better moves, stick to the block. after all, the Q9 stone is useless, while the Q10 wall works well with the thickness at the top]
;W[ok];B[nk]C[too aggressive. white is very strong here, so a defense at N13 might be better.]

nah, O12 is better.why risk losing when you can simply defend and win?]

[ns]C[Thanks for the review !

you were leading by 40+ points until the Q11 screw-up. then you were still leading by about 10+ points, but the J13 move was too agressive and let him leak into your influence.

you seem like a pretty good player, but next time, halfway through the game, close your eyes for 10 secounds, take a deep breath, drink some water and freshen up. the mistakes that cost you this game are not ones that you should be making, judging from your standard for the rest of the game. i think you are a bit like me, and tend to get a bit brain-dead late-game. other than that, i can't really find any glaring mistakes in your gameplay, aside from some small errors here and there.

i guess thats about it. good luck and hope you find this review useful!]

Thus, a pincer in this case is also probably disadvantageous.]
