AB[pd][dp]C[dmg: Hello, I'm Damien and I will comment for black. My comment's will be prefixed by dmg.]
;W[cd];B[pp]C[Golfels [11k\]: Hi gg
sanji11 [13k\]: GG];W[ec];B[cg];W[fq];B[cl]TR[cj][cn]C[dmg: this is not joseki usually we play either closer to other stones at one of the triangle stones]
;W[cn];B[dn]LB[eo:2][fq:A][hq:1]TR[dm][do][dq][dr]C[Good move here?
dmg: I don't think so. It is not a bad move though. Your move aims at building a wall around the triangles, letting white takes the corner. It seems wrong for me because of the A stone. Usually we play this move to build a framework on the bottom size.
I would rather try 1 to pressur the A stone or 2 to separate white stones but I don't hold the truth]
;W[cq];B[cp]C[dmg: this is in contradiction with building a framework on the bottom side. Black seems too clustered.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[ep]C[Was this a mess up?
dmg: looks ok for me.];B[er];W[fr];B[eo];W[fp];B[bq];W[cr];B[br]
;W[es];B[co]TR[cm]C[dmg: this is a empty triangle also so known as bad shape. And it protects from nothing. If you wish to ensure capture of the white stones then hane at triange is better]
;W[bs];B[hc];W[nq];B[pm];W[kq];B[ho]C[Any better move then this?
dmg: it's good to reduce white frameworks. maybe h6 is a bit stronger]
;W[hp];B[fo];W[go];B[gn];W[gp];B[in]C[dmg: why not j6 or h6? This one calls]
;W[io];B[hn];W[jo];B[ph]TR[pd][pm][pp]SQ[mc]C[dmg: your stones are a bit too much on the 4th line, you should try to play some a bit lower try around N17 to reinforce your H17 stone]
;W[jn];B[il]TR[hg]SQ[ik]C[dmg: too close to your wall, you should go further to be lighter. Or even see big at H13]
;W[jc];B[ge]TR[he]C[dmg: keima is to attack, tobi (H15) is stronger to escape]
;W[md];B[nc]TR[oc][pc]C[dmg: hitting on the shoulder reinforce your opponent. you should try Q17 or P17]
;W[mc];B[nb]C[dmg: that's yose];W[mb];B[jb];W[kb];B[ib];W[pf]
;B[of];W[pj];B[pg];W[rf];B[qf]TR[rh]C[dmg: maybe consider S12 to separte white]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[qd];B[qc];W[qg]C[Am i doing the right thing here?
dmg: up to now there might be faster way to kill but that's not bad]

(;B[pf]TR[qh]C[dmg: maybe connecting is not necessary];W[rc]
;B[rg];W[se];B[rd];W[re];B[qb]C[dmg: this one at S18 kills white]
;W[rb];B[sg]C[dmg: unuseful move];W[qa];B[pa];W[ra];B[ob];W[qh]
;B[qi];W[qj];B[ri];W[rj];B[nj];W[rm];B[ql]TR[qn]C[dmg: wrong direction stops white from expanding. The computation is always: first enclose whites and build strength and then if you can kill, then it will come. Never be eager to kill]
;W[rl];B[rn]C[dmg: bad shape, white at r6 would be painful]
;W[qm]C[How to get white here?
dmg: I don't know, connect R6 is kind of a priority here];B[pl]
;W[qn];B[ro];W[po];B[qp];W[oo];B[or];W[nr];B[oq];W[np];B[kf]
;W[mf];B[mg]TR[ki]C[dmg: too close to white, no needs to touch oponent to enclose him k11 is shuting white down]
;W[nd];B[kd];W[kc];B[ld];W[lf];B[lg];W[ke];B[je];W[le];B[jd]
;W[lc];B[nf];W[ic];B[id]TR[hd][he]C[dmg: bad shape, whould have been better at either triangle part. If white atari L14 then captures M15 group]
;W[gb];B[hb];W[gc];B[gd];W[fd];B[fe];W[ee];B[ef];W[de];B[fg]
;W[eh];B[df];W[cf];B[dg]TR[bf]C[dmg: atari would have been a better move. The cut is useless for white]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[ag];B[bh]C[dmg: why is that? why not hane at A12?]
;W[lm];B[kl];W[jm];B[jl];W[im];B[hm]TR[gl][hl]C[dmg: again empty triangle, consider H8 or G8]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[hk];B[fm];W[lk];B[ll];W[ml];B[mk];W[mm];B[kk]
;W[lj];B[kj];W[nk];B[mj];W[ok];B[nl];W[nm];B[ol]C[Any way black could have lived
dmg: yes if instead of pushing m8 stone, you have escape your group at j10 the you should had time to save Q8 group by connecting]

;W[dm];B[cm];W[oi];B[oj];W[pk];B[mi];W[ni];B[mh]C[dmg: captures is always best because it reduce potential problems in the future]

C[dmg: Obviously a mistake a good way to improve is too ask yourself what was your aim with that move. The game is finished there, maybe a seki can be obtained on the bottom corner but not the kill]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[pb];B[tt];W[rr];B[qr];W[sq];B[sp]TR[rp]C[dmg: mistake, connection at S4 is correct]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[ro]C[dmg: see variation for the line to live]

dmg: Ok this game was lost because of a tsumego error. After several mistake it was still possible to live. I would advice you to do the following to improve:
  - Avoid empty triangle
  - Do a lot of tsumego
  - Revise your game for simple errors and ask yourself what was your intention when doing this move.
Feel free to ask by mail if you have any more questions.])
