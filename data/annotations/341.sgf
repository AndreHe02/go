Any comments would be most appreciated.

Some of my comments are pretty harsh.  Please do not let these discourage
you, you have real talent for the game. Games where you lose are the best
ones to get analyzed, because you learn from your mistakes.  Since you
lost, there are more mistakes by you than by your opponent.  Some general
remarks occur to me.  You make lots of inappropriate forcing moves.  It is
important to think about how the board will look after the exchange you
force.  Only make forcing moves when you are better off after the forced
sequence than your opponent.  This is harder to do than it sounds, but work
at it.  Forcing moves are very often best left as ko threats.
Once you know the outcome of the game, and you think you don't have a
reasonable chance to win, resign.  It is rude to make your opponent fill
out every dame when the result has been clear from the beginning.  This
last comment is a matter of taste.  Of course, once you agree to a game, it
doesn't end until both players pass or one resigns.  Both players have the
right to make the moves they think are called for, and even if resignation
is the best move in a situation, you can't expect to find the best move all
the time, or expect your opponent to find it
either.]US[Brought to you by No Name Go Server]GN[grant-HM(B) NNGS]EV[None]
