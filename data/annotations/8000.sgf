C[Hi I am dtslife and am looking forward to promote Go in the high school arena in CA.
I first eviewed my game online so most of my comments are tagged with "dtslife [1k\]".
Later I added in some comments offline.
Kaizoku3 [1k\]: hello
dtslife [1k\]: hi
dtslife [1k\]:  I am white in this game. My opponent is Kaizoku3.
dtslife [1k\]: The time settings were 25minutes main time and 5x30 byo-yomi
dtslife [1k\]: I would only like the first 100 moves reviewed for fuseki
dtslife [1k\]: The game result does not accurately depict my strength as a player because I got very lucky with aji and a couple of opponent mistakes. I didn't realize my potential to get such a large kill until ten moves in after 120.


I would like to thank my reviewer and GTL for analyzing my game
and giving me the opportunity to be a stronger player.

Even if it does not get analyzed, I would like to thank the GTL for
their consideration and helpful services.

Thank you so much.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ce]LB[de:B]
C[dtslife[1k\]: what is the best response to B?
dtslife [1k\]: Is this the normal continuation of ni-ren-sei?
dtslife [1k\]: What are some other variations for black?

[Nexik\] White 6 is normal answer to black approach and I think 90% of pro games choose this pattern.

Black next play hane or avalanche joseki]
(;B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[cj];W[pj]LB[qj:A]C[dtslife [1k\]: Would A have been better or is this pretty standard?

[Nexik\] It's more taste or style of the game. I personally prefer A because this give more solid base than 4th line. But move from the game is also very good and you can't said which one is better]
;B[cn]TR[de][cf][df][cj]LB[fp:B]C[dtslife [1k\]: One of the go proverbs is to play away from strength: the marked groups seem pretty strong. is an approach at b better?

[Nexik\] Black approach is proper move, because left side is good place to build moyo, with white 12 on right side you destroy black chance to build moyo there so only place where blac can build something is left side.

On other hand black is playing very far from his strength.]
;W[fq]LB[ch:B][dj:A]C[dtslife [1k\]: I think the iron pillar at A would have been pretty devastating to me
dtslife [1k\]: is it urgent to reduce here?
dtslife [1k\]: if black plays a the invasion at b does not seem possible anymore

[Nexik\] Territory on left side is not yet big enough to worry about. Go is the game of balance you got upper left and bottom down corners, so black should get some points on the left side]
(;B[qm];W[qf]LB[pj:A]C[dtslife [1k\]: Now i question the move at A
dtslife [1k\]: it seems to have been a bit too high. is this true?

[Nexik\] It has some weakness, but is too early to said if this move is good or bad it depends on your fighting skill in the midlle stage of the game]
;B[nc]
(;W[qc]LB[qc:A][rd:C][qh:B]C[dtslife [1k\]: the invasion at A was bad for me. My other option was to play at c.  Are there any other alternatives?
dtslife [1k\]: I also  was worried about an invasion at B

[Nexik\] Invasion was bad];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob]
;B[nb];W[oc];B[od]C[[Nexik\] Now white should made some forcing moves before defending corner]
(;W[pc]TR[qf][pj]C[dtslife [1k\]: I belive my joseki choice hurt me or is this okay?
dtslife [1k\]: In the game i was hoping to keep sabaki with my two weak stones
dtslife [1k\]: my game plan as to reduce the moyo and run to the center
dtslife [1k\]: because territorily speakying i am slightly ahead]
;B[pf]
(;W[cl]LB[bp:A][iq:B]C[dtslife [1k\]: Here is my invasion
dtslife [1k\]: After A i was going to jump out at b
dtslife [1k\]: was this a good choice or do i have have too many weak stones?
dtslife [1k\]: Would a reduction here have been better?
dtslife [1k\]: What move?

[Nexik\] There are to big point on the board]
(;B[bp];W[cq];B[dl]LB[en:A]C[[Nexik\] Black play very bad moves, he should just jump to A]
;W[dk];B[dm];W[ck];B[di];W[bq]C[dtslife [1k\]: I wanted to put pressure o nthe stones
dtslife [1k\]: because i felt my empty triangle was relatively strong

[Nexik\] Your stones on the left side are pretty weak];B[ek]
;W[dj]
(;B[ej]C[[Nexik\] There is no ko threats in the opening so black should just connect]
;W[ci];B[ch];W[bj]TR[ek][dm]LB[dl:B][fq:A]C[dtslife [1k\]: I decided to fight my way out with ko
dtslife [1k\]: and i felt that the opponents influence was slightly neutralized in the bottom middle of the board
dtslife [1k\]: is this an accurate judgement?
dtslife [1k\]: I thought my A group slightly neutralized the B group]
;B[bi];W[bh];B[cj];W[bn];B[bo];W[ci];B[dh];W[ai];B[jq]
(;W[jo]LB[pq:A]C[dtslife [1k\]: I chose to cap
dtslife [1k\]: to reduce the counter act the moyo
dtslife [1k\]: When would an invasion at A be appropriate? Can you reduce moyo with A?

[Nexik\] Move from the game was right, invasion would be very bad for white]
;B[jp];W[ko]C[dtslife [1k\]: What is a better move than this
dtslife [1k\]: i realized that i played too slowly

[Nexik\] This move is solid and very good.];B[mp];W[ho];B[qq]
;W[bm]C[[Nexik\] this move is very slow, giving black extra strength in the ceneter]
;B[gm]C[dtslife [1k\]: i believe that up to here the game is pretty close
Kaizoku3 [2k\]: yes
dtslife [1k\]: you have a very large white corner
dtslife [1k\]: i was struggling to decide whether or not to take the top or right side]
;W[pg]C[dtslife [1k\]: so first i haned
dtslife [1k\]: i wanted to maintain sabaki iwht q13  and be able to live too]
(;B[of]
(;W[kc]TR[qf][pg][pj]LB[nd:A]C[dtslife [1k\]: and then i took the top
dtslife [1k\]: i played l17 to take territory and neutralize moyo.
dtslife [1k\]: also i felt that  the marked stones would not help me territorily i the game
dtslife [1k\]: did i play too early?
dtslife [1k\]: also i thought the weakness at a would be too my advantage so the opponent could not ignore

[Nexik\] Good direction but maybe too clos black strong shape]
;B[og];W[ph];B[rj];W[mi]LB[ni:A][rk:B]C[dtslife [1k\]: A seemed to small
dtslife [1k\]: and i realized that n11 was overplay
dtslife [1k\]: is there a better move

[Nexik\] A is pretty nice.];B[ni];W[nh];B[oh]
(;W[oi]C[[Nexik\] Wrong atari];B[nj];W[pl];B[oj];W[qj];B[pi]
;W[pm];B[qn];W[qi];B[nm];W[rk]C[I felt like black let me off the hook here or is there a away for black to kill me?]
;B[ql]SQ[pl][pm]C[It seems i had to sacrifice the marked stones in order to make life.]
;W[rg];B[qk];W[ri];B[rl];W[sj];B[pk]LB[id:C][je:D][nm:A][nn:B]
C[dtslife [1k\]: Is it neccessary to reduce in the AB area?
dtslife [1k\]: this game was really close up until now but all of black's terriotry is sloid
dtslife [1k\]: and my territory is not secuired yet in some places namely in the top center
dtslife [1k\]: What is the best move to play here globally?
dtslife [1k\]: C or D or somewhere else?

[Nexik\] C is nice move.]
(;W[mo]C[[Nexik\] Aji keshi];B[lp]
(;W[no]LB[mm:A]C[[Nexik\] Too greddy, A is proper move];B[lo]
;W[mm]C[dtslife [1k\]: and the trouble begins here
dtslife [1k\]: If you would like to comment on the aji it is move 108, but after 108, i had to rely on black's mistakes to win

You may stop your review here but additional comments are much appreciated.

If this marks the end of your review then I would again like to express my gratitude for your time.]

;B[lk];W[ll];B[kl];W[kk];B[mj];W[km];B[jl]LB[nq:A][oq:B]C[dtslife [1k\]: Is it possible for white to exploit black's weakness here?
dtslife [1k\]: or is there no hope
dtslife [1k\]: black certainly thought there was a weakness]
