;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd]C[The sanrensei is a territorial opening, basically. You want to build a large moyo. White's next move is sort of strange, usually there is an approach to either of the corners, or perhaps a sanrensei of their own. The main weakness of sanrensei is believing you can keep all of the moyo you create, i think. Also, it's still susceptible to invasions. [See variations\]]

;W[pj]C[Hmm, the Q8-Q10 shape is beginning to bother me. It seems to have lots of power into the centre. Can you suggest a good way to deal with this.

I don't think this group is strong at this point. The center is still fully available. You could keep the group in check with something like R13, but I think a better move, at this point, would be on the bottom. [see variations\]]

(;B[rl]C["Creeping along the side. Im trying to at least prevent the Q8-Q10 shape from getting side territory! Is this a good idea?"

Not really. It's slow for you.];W[ph];B[rj];W[qi];B[rh];W[rn]
;B[rm];W[so];B[qg];W[mk]C["Ok, REALLY scary for me now. White's got massive central influence. Ideas?"

Perhaps a move on the bottom, or an approach to the lower left. Even on the left side in the middle. [see variations\]]

(;B[cq]C["3-3 invasion. Trying to score cheap points so early into the game. Comments?"

I think it makes it a little harder for you to establish yourselfon the bottom after this.]

I don't think it would have been any better. Both of these moves create a third weak group. E10 should be your focus for now. [see variation\]]
