C[Sure I won this game by 8,5 points but I can't help but feel weird about this game that was rather unusual to me. I am pretty sure I made quite a few mistakes and have the feeling black could have won if he had been just a little bit more aggressive. I had the feeling I was behind during the whole game and was actually quite surprised to find out I had won.

Hi, I'm Tim, and I'll be your reviewer today :)  I'm around 8k.  If you have any questions, you can reach me at timkington@gmail.com.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[jj]LB[pj:a]C[That is a rather unusual fusekin but that black stone I feared would limit very much the interest of a playing stratedy towards influence which my stones at the star points aimed at.

This probably isn't a good move.  A would be better.];W[qn]
C[I prefered to settle within the black area to prevent the formation of a huge moyo. But wouldn't a pincer be difficulmt to answer to in this situation ?

I agree - I think a pincer is Black's best bet.  That doesn't mean it's unplayable for you, though.]

(;B[mq];W[rq]C[Misclicks are your friend. I believe I was lucky the game did not turn out too bad for me (I wanted to play a standard slide under the hoshi at S4). Did black answer this move correctly or is this too aggressive by white and better punishable ?

I don't think this is punishable right now, but he should keep an eye on it for later.]
;B[qq];W[rp]C[Mistake for Black.  When there's a weakness that you can't see how to exploit, you should leave it there until either you come up with something, or the local situation changes.  This exchange just made you strong.]
;B[cj]LB[ql:a]C[It would be much better for Black to play around A.]
;W[cl];B[cg];W[fd]LB[cn:a]C[This is probably a mistake.  Black A could be pretty painful.]

(;B[cq]C[A little early for a 3-3 invasion I believe, but the black stone in the center of the go board had me worried on the use I would be able to make of my influence later on.

I think this is okay - you don't have a wide extension on either side, so you're not going to get too much out of this.]

(;W[dq]C[Oops.  Wrong way - you want to block on the wider side.  Since you don't have an extension along the bottom, you should go the other way.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn]
(;W[cr]C[This move is used when you're making a big territory to the right.  It doesn't fit here.]
;B[br];W[bq];B[bp];W[bs];B[aq];W[dr];B[bm]
(;W[cm];B[gq]C[Could I have been more aggressive here by playing J3 ?

You should have played L3 earlier.  J3 now is a bit risky, because your wall doesn't have eyes, and Black has a forcing move at E5.  It's hard to say what to do here - if you defend passively, Black gets a nice lead, so you probably have to fight, but it will be dangerous.]

(;W[hp];B[hq]C[Black lets you off the hook.  This is a terrible move.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[bl]LB[gp:a]C[This should be at A to make your group safe, unless you're planning to fight a ko for the life of this group.]
;B[ao];W[nc];B[qg];W[pb];B[qc];W[jd]LB[kc:a]C[I would prefer A, but this is good too.]
;B[hc];W[gc]C[Black is ruining any influence with that position in the center so I thought I would force him to run towards the center and keep as much territory as possible.]
;B[jc];W[kc];B[id];W[jb];B[ic];W[oe]LB[kd:a]C[This is a mistake.  Black has a very weak group at the top, and you need to chase it.  You should hope to chase it toward the weak group on the left, and maybe you'll get to attack both with one move.  That's called a splitting attack, and it's VERY painful for the victim.]
;B[pe];W[of];B[ie];W[qi];B[qb]C[This seems a little early doesn't it ? I would think black has some interesting options with Q12 or Q9 ? When I looked again at what I had played at R11 I thought that really looked like a far away extension.

You're right, I think.  This is a little timid.];W[ql]C[Hence the reinforcement here.]
;B[jp];W[ik]LB[gp:a]C[Those two stones are getting pretty weak.  You should probably have played at A.]

;B[je];W[lc];B[ek];W[el];B[fk]LB[fo:a]C[Doesn't this look too passive ? F8 feels better in my opinion.

This is okay.  Black's probably trying for territory above.  He should play A next, and you won't get any territory here.]

;B[hb];W[pf];B[qf]LB[ke:a]C[You should probably play A now.  If you do, Black's group has no eyes, and has to run.]

(;W[bf]C[One of the most crucial move in this game I think. The following sequence had black lose about 20 points and had white take an advantage he would not lose any more. I don't believe black answered properly. Was this move really good or does it look more like a trick play ?]

(;W[qr]LB[ni:a]C[This isn't big enough, and it's gote.  In general, sente endgame plays are worth twice as much as gote plays.  See variation.

How about A, to make your territory on the right bigger?];B[pr]
;W[qs];B[ps];W[qp];B[pq];W[fh]LB[rr:a]C[If Black plays at A, you lose everything you gained with the last sequence.]

(;W[ep]LB[am:a]C[You have a move at A that is very strong sente.  It's only worth a point, but if Black screws up, he could die.  See variation.]

Yes, better to play A, and hope for a mistake.

C[Good game.  You played pretty well. The big things that I saw: White failed to attack Black's weak group at the top - that group should have had zero points, and it wound up with 13.  Both players ignored the right center until the end of the game, and then agreed to split it evenly :).  Also, the endgame moves were played in the wrong order.  Both players played gote moves while large sente moves were still available.]
