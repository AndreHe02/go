C[Hi, reviewer.

I played W this game with a friend, both are 1d.   We played a slow game without time limit,and couldn't finish in our first meeting, and finished the game in a second evening. Throughout the game I was behind starting from UL corner's joseki, and a mistake from the left side. After the game we went over the game and picked out a few mistakes.  I would appreciate it if you could comment on the game, especially the openning and middle game.  Thanks. (I have added a few comments.)

reid:  Hello Jay.  The final outcome of this game revolves around a fight in the upper right-hand side, but I think there was some misreading going on with respect to that fight, and the fact that white had to win that fight put him at a disadvantage to begin with.

I hope to show you (and your opponent - I will analyze his moves as well) that the go board is both smaller and larger than what you've been thinking about up til now.  Smaller in the sense that the different tactical fights are more closely connected than you've been considering them, and larger in the sense that you have a lot more options for each move than you might think.

In your comments, you say things like "I had to play this way because ...".  One important key to getting stronger is to remove the automatic responses from your play.  Every move needs to be considered afresh.  Even josekis are flexible enough that you need to consider the other corners and all the stones already on the board in order to make the correct continuation.  Following any rule or guideline (even joseki) blindly leads to uninteresting games at best, and frozen progress at worst.]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[cd];W[pd];B[nc];W[kd];B[qn];W[nq];B[rp];W[ql]
;B[qf]LB[oe:A]C[reid: this looks like the first problematic move.  Black has not finished the lower-right corner, but he has made a commitment (by playing S4) in this area.  In order for white to take advantage of this, he needs to get sente.

In the upper right, white doesn't want to tenuki because black A (P15) is very difficult for white to handle.  So white needs to respond in the upper right, but he needs sente.  How to get it?

Try your best to get this before looking at the variation.]

(;W[pf]LB[pg:A]C[reid: Here's a nice simple saying to remember in go: "you touch me, you help me".  In general, when you play a contact move touching your opponent's stone, his response will naturally strengthen him.  Of course, that may be OK.  If he's already strong, making him stronger may be exactly what you want to do.

But every time before you make a contact move, you should ask yourself: "do I want him to get stronger here?"  In this case, if he gets stronger around A, it hurts your stone at R8.  So this move is a 'thank-you' - black should politely respond at A and say "domo arigato".]
;B[pg];W[of];B[qj]LB[qe:A]C[My opponent is quite aggressive.

reid: Yes.  Black has no reason not to play normal joseki here with A.  Since he doesn't, white A would be a good enough response.]
;W[ol]LB[pk:B][rl:A][pm:C]C[This move lets black link up by playing underneath at A.  If white wants to keep black split, he should play at B or C instead.  B looks better in this game.  If white doesn't want to keep black split, he should tenuki.]
;B[on]LB[pm:A]C[reid: Oops.  Now P8 may be OK because black can't join up anymore - white A (Q7) is sente.]
;W[ml]LB[qe:B][qq:A]C[reid: hmmm, white seems to be running away before he can possibly be surrounded.  Better would be either A or B.  A is more important because it keeps the balance of power between the three black R6 stones even with the two R8 white stones.]
;B[mn];W[qq]C[reid: Better late than never :-)  Black should have taken the three-three on his previous move.]
;B[oj]C[reid: This is slow since it doesn't attack the white stones seriously.]
;W[qo]LB[qe:A]C[reid: What does whte want to accomplish here?  The three P8 stones are not strong enough to damage the black P6 stones.  Better to take the big move at A (R15).]
;B[pm];W[rn]C[reid: Strange for whiate to let black split him like this.  Black is happy to push through.]
;B[pl]C[reid: good result for black.];W[rm]C[reid:  This may feel satisfying, but white didn't accomplish much.  S6 and S7 are second line, so there's not much territory there.  The S4 stone is cut off (though not completely without aji), but now the black stones are all connected and the N8 stone isn't doing much of anything.]
;B[qe]C[reid: Very big.];W[od]C[reid: Normal joseki is A (R16), of course.  P16 is reserved for when O17 is one line higher - at O16.

With these last few rather serious mistakes by white, we have to say that black is ahead.]
;B[qc]LB[rc:B][qd:A]C[reid: But this is an overplay.  Normal would be to push at A (R16), or slide to B (S17).  See variation in the next move.]
;W[qd]
(;B[pb]C[reid: Woah!  Black wants everything!];W[rc]LB[rb:B]
[rd:A][rh:C][pk:D]C[reid:  In this position, white would do better to just come straight down with A (S16).  Then black has a difficult choce to make - which side to defend?

I like to suggest the image of water squirting out of a hose, or a watermelon seed squeezed out between your fingers.  That kind of push-through, where white squeezes between two close black formations, is terrible for black.  He cannot defend on both sides.

After A, white can look forward to either B or C.  Black will probably defend the corner, so white can leave C as a very large endgame point for later.  Or if white tries a cut at D, etc later, black will have to respond carefully.]
;B[rb];W[pc]C[reid:  This is aji-keshi - it helps black.  Better to simply leave it unplayed.

It is too easy to fall into the trap of thinkiing "it's sente, it must be good", but that is an attitude that you *must* correct in order to improve.  The real key is thinking about what moves are necessary - don't play *any* unnecessary moves.]
;B[qb];W[ed]C[reid: Now white is leaving unfinished business behind.  He really needs to connect S17.  As long as black has the potential to connect all his stones with S16, he never has to worry about attacks on any of his right-side stones.

E16 is big, but S16 (or S15) is urgent - the proverb says "play the urgent move, not the big move".  (Better to have played S16 instead of S17 in the first place, of course).]
;B[ec];W[cn]C[Since I was unhappy with the result a simple hane at F17, I decided to test my opponent's response in LL corner first.]
;B[me]C[reid: Ouch - because black has no worries about his stones (S16 is available), he can attack very strongly.  This is a good dynamic move, splitting white and attacking his heavy stones.  This move shows the spirit of go: black strikes while the iron is hot, and gets an advantage that he can use throughout the rest of the game.]
;W[mg];B[lc]LB[lf:A]C[reid: Ahrg!  But black didn't continue!  He should keep white split with A  White's not-quite-connection between P14 and N13 will come back to haunt him! (N13 should probably be at P13, then jump to N13).

Black M17 shows too much fear.  Here the black stones are stronger than the white - black should rampage!  Black would like to swallow up the L16 stone without ever having to play M17.]
;W[dd]LB[lf:C][og:A][ph:B]C[Now, the upper side is less intereting, I have to take the left.

reid: White still has unfinished buisiness (P14) - no time for starting another group!  I would probably exchange A for B, then play at C and try to hang on.]
;B[dc];W[ce];B[fd];W[bd]C[I decided to not play small scattered snow joseki since the upper side is less interesting to me due to B's M17 stone. But, I am not sure about my joseki choice here.]
;B[cc];W[ef]LB[de:D][fe:C][df:A][dg:B]C[reid:  This lets black take the B16 stone.  Better to play the hanging connection at A.  If black E14 next, then white B, black C, white D.  Then L16 will almost certainly get swallowed up.

Maybe better to just play the small avalanche after all.];B[de]
LB[be:A]C[Black should just play A (D15).  By playing here first, white takes the stone for an eye.]
;W[ee];B[be];W[cf]LB[bf:A][df:B]C[reid: since black can still push forward with A, it might be better for white to take the stone off with B instead.  If then black plays C14, white gets to choose how to proceed.]
;B[bf];W[cg]C[reid: painful for white.  Black may be crawling on the second line, but white's E14 stone is crying its inefficiency.]
;B[bg];W[ch]C[I have given a lot cash away.

reid: Yeah.  White could try to hane here instead of C12.  The aji is bad, but white is pretty desperate now.]
;B[cj]LB[lf:B][fq:A]C[My opponent is playing aggressive and left me no choice but to plan a large scale attack.

reid: This is exactly what white wants!  Black is far enough ahead that he could easily coast to a victory.  This kind of move gives white a chance to make a comeback!

Black should just play at A, for example, or take up the attack on P14 with B]
;W[en]LB[bh:A][fq:B]C[reid: Again, strategic thinking demands that white keep black separated: A looks like white's only move to me.

Here's how my thinking goes:  black C10 has a chance to connect or run, so it has miai and is therefore strong.  If white cuts off C10 by playing A, C10 is weaker which makes white C6 relatively stronger.  C6 ends up being a weak group between two weak groups - a strategically advantagous position.

You might say "well, black has to play around B after white E6, so white can play A next".  I won't dispute that, but the difference is that by changing the order, white gives black a chance to play C10 lightly and sacrifice it - after all, black has already gained by playing around B, so he can afford it.]
;B[fp];W[ci]LB[bh:A]C[reid: A is better.  Look at it this way: if white does manage to kill C10, he wants it to be sitting in the largest possible white space.  here black can still slide way into white's territory.]
;B[ej];W[bp]LB[bj:A][ck:B]C[reid: This is a mistake for white for the same reason we already discussed in the lower right corner: white is thowing away the possible three-three invasion.  This is good *only* if white kills the C10 stones and makes this a larger territory by playing at B4.  If black gets away, B4 is a loss.

White should see how black responds to A.  If he tenukis, white has no problems in this area.  If he pulls back to B, then white has already stopped any possible connection to B13, and he can proceed with attacking the black group on a large scale.]
;B[cq];W[dk];B[dj];W[bk];B[bj]LB[gj:B][pk:A]C[reid: White seems to be thrashing - hoping something good will fall out of the tree.

Better would be to formulate a plan to attack the black stones on a large scale, perhaps trying to coordinate it with a cut at A (Q9)

White needs to get some stones in the area around B to help out his P14 group.

The real tragedy here for black is that he is so busy trying to save this new group of stones that he can't attack the white P14 group.]
;W[bi]C[After a few moves it was apparent that this move is wrong.  Should'v at A11.  The way it is played there is a ko here for B to connent.  This affected the subsequent fighing to come.

reid:  White is trying to play on both sides of the black line.  But the rule in go is that you only get to play once for each time your opponent plays.  You don't get to play on both sides.]
;B[bl];W[ck];B[ak];W[ai]C[I did not want to have a ko, so the game now is kill or else.  Not too good for me.

reid: No, it's difficult.  Especially since black E9 is painful.  But then black shouldn't even be fighting here, so white can't complain too much - it's your only remaining chance :-)]
;B[ek];W[dl];B[el];W[dm]LB[aj:A]C[reid: Hmmm, white had a chance to play A (A10) now instead of D7.  Or even the previous move.  Black gets to atari four (or three) stones, but white can connect his groups leaving black to struggle in the center.]
;B[aj];W[gn]C[reid: white is struggling.];B[gf];W[fi]LB[fh:A]
C[reid: Overplay by white, as black's next move shows.   White should play at A.

Remember the proverb: play away from strength.  The black stones are solid here.]
;B[eh]LB[gk:E][cm:D][bn:A][bo:C][co:B]C[reid: This exposes white's overplay, but I think black plays it too soon.  Let's look at the whole board:

The white E14 group has one eye for sure.  The E6 group probably has one eye - black B6 looks like it removes an eye in sente, so let's say there's one sente eye there for white (though I wouldn't want to bet my life on it).  And of course the P14 group is still hanging by a thread - no eyes yet.  White's lower right corner is the only white group that is secure.

Black on the other hand has only one weak group: the E9 stones.

All black needs to do is pull out the E9 stones and white will collapse.  Black should exchange A (B6) for white B (C5) first (if white C-B5, black D-C7 and it's still sente for black), then jump to E (G9).  White cannot win after that.

I always feel that if my opponent has two weak groups on the board, I can win.  Here white has three, so he should have no chance.]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[gh];B[ei];W[gg]C[reid: black is only helping white to rescue his P14 group.  Exchanging E12/F12 for G13/G12 is *much* better for white than for black.]
;B[hl];W[in]LB[gm:A][ho:B]C[reid: Later, white is worried about his connection, so he plays A.  Better would be to play at B now to save a move later.]
;B[hj];W[gj]C[Doesn't appear to be too good.  May be H11 better?

reid: Here's how to answer that question.  Would you rather see black peep at G10 or at H11?  Heck, if he peeps at G10, white might even ignore it!]
;B[hi];W[gi];B[gk];W[ik];B[hk]C[reid: see my comment at the end of your variation]

(;W[gm]C[Is this a slow move.  I was worried about possibility of cutting at F6.  This also takes way eye shape for B. But, this endanged the upper group.

reid: Taking away eye-shape doesn't do much good if you can't kill the group.  Almost anything would be better than this kind of move.  G4 for example - see how he responds.  Even B3 or B7 would work better..]
;B[hf]C[reid: Oops - white is in trouble.];W[hh]LB[ig:A]C[reid: This is rather crude.  More graceful is to play at A, then when black plays B, white H12, Black B, white C.]
;B[ih];W[ii];B[hg]C[reid: This is a mistake for black. More explanation of this around move 115...]
;W[ig]C[reid The result is the same as if white had started with J13, but that's because black make a mistake.]
;B[jh];W[fk];B[fl];W[fj];B[gl];W[ij];B[eg];W[ff];B[fe];W[df]
;B[il];W[jk];B[jm]C[reid: Black should continue to play tight here: K8 instead of K7

Actually, black's forcing with E13, etc is a mistake.  After this sequence, black has too many cutting points.  Instead of H13 (move 101), black should have extended to J13 to keep connected, or to K12 to help threaten the single white stone at J11.

After completeing the forcing sequence, black realized he was short on liberties and couldn't follow through.  Better to leave the forcing moves for later.]
;W[jn];B[km];W[jg];B[kh];W[kg];B[li]LB[lg:B][lh:A][lj:C]C[reid: Again, black needs to play tight when the fighting gets close.  A, threatening to push through at B or the jump to C is better.]
;W[lh];B[mh];W[lg];B[ki];W[mi];B[mj];W[ni];B[lj]LB[kk:B][lk:A]
C[reid: the four white stones can still get away.  Black should play at A or B instead.]
;W[ge]C[reid: Black's cutting points come back to haunt him.]
;B[ie]C[reid: hmmm, black sure likes to play loosely.  But here it may be best...]
;W[he];B[if];W[hd]LB[fc:A][gd:B]C[reid: Better to exchange A for B first.  Then H16 is atari on three stones.]
;B[id];W[hc];B[jc];W[kc];B[jb]C[reid: black is losing out on both the left G13 group and the P14 group - he's falling apart.

I'm having difficulty understanding black K18.  Black's focus should be on maintaining the attack on the M13 stones.  L18 would be natural, or L15 might work too.  But with K18, after white saves the G13 group with F17, black is going to have to play again.]
;W[fc];B[kb]LB[ke:A]C[reid: Hmmm, I still like A (L15) better.  But if black wants to try to kill the white stones, M18 would be stronger than L18.]
;W[qg]
(;B[oh]LB[qh:A]C[reid: this helps white to make two eyes.  Black should play atari at A - see variation.]
;W[nh];B[qh];W[rg];B[nf];W[ng];B[rh]LB[og:B][lk:A]C[reid: Hmmm, if black had played at A a few moves back, I think he'd be able to cut at B now.]
;W[re]LB[og:A]C[reid: Black should certainly cut at A now!!]
;B[rf];W[nj]C[I should'v played atari at P13 first, but my opponent let me get away with this.

reid: Black P13 now might be risky.  Black can kill the Q16 stones, but if white can get a seki between the M10 stones and the K9 group, the whole J8 group could be in trouble.  Of coures, black needed to play M9 many moves ago (instead of M10).

Anyway, black is still ahead, no need to take risks.];B[kk]
;W[og];B[ph]C[reid: hmmm, might be better to take off two stones instead of connecting.  Later, Q15 being sente could make a difference in the eyes.]
;W[ne]C[This is where we left it at the first evening. I felt that W is behind in territory and the reminder game will be decided by lower side.

reid: Yes, black is ahead.  So how can we estimate the territory on the lower side?  Well, it's pretty easy: both sides have access into that territory, so there are essentially 0 points there.  Actually, since white still has a weak group, we have to count it as more black territory than white.

So white really has no chance left, unless black helps him out a lot.]
;B[fb];W[gc];B[iq]C[This B move put me to desperation, I badly needed a sente to settle the group at D6, and then take as much on the lower side as possible.]
;W[jq];B[ho]LB[ip:A][bq:B]C[reid: Looks like black just wants to finish the game.  But instead of hardening all white's positions like this, black should just stand firmly  at A, and then take the big endgame move at B.  He wins easily on points.  The lower side is fairly even on points, but black has the entire upper side, plus center and right side.]
;W[im];B[fo]C[reid: now black takes an unnecessary point];W[bq]
;B[bn];W[cp];B[dq];W[br]C[Bad move?

reid: Yes, white should hane.  It's still gote, but at least the corner is alive.]
;B[cr];W[cm]LB[bm:D][em:F][fn:E][bo:B][co:A][do:C]C[reid: but this move is much worse.  As it stands, black can't cut at A because of white B, black C, white D.  But after black answers at B7, the cut works.  White force his opponent to take sente.

White should just connect at E.];B[bm];W[do];B[bo];W[co];B[fn]
;W[em]C[reid: unnecessary.  whte should leave this.];B[fm];W[bs]
LB[cs:A]C[I still end up in gote.

reid: Yeah.  And you might as well hane at A - it's still gote, but it's worth a point.]
;B[jp];W[ip];B[kp]LB[io:A]C[reid: now black is being greedy.  Atari at A is safer and good enough.]
;W[lo];B[ko]LB[io:A]C[reid: Ack: bad shape!  Almost anything is better than this move.  A is still good.

Black doesn't need to kill these whte stones.  He just needs to win the game.]
;W[ln];B[kn];W[pk];B[ok];W[qk];B[nk];W[mm];B[nl];W[nm];B[nn]
;W[mk];B[om]LB[lm:A]C[reid: heh, black is not thinking clearly:  He should cut at A of course.]
;W[lm];B[sg]C[My opponent mistake. But this put my O13 group in danger, but have to time to take care of that.]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[rj];B[se];W[sd]C[Since B has more liberties on the left group, I felt that I have fight this ko.

reid: But this is a ko fight that white can't possibly win.  Black has too many internal threats.]
;B[rd];W[bc];B[sc]LB[pe:C][qi:B][ri:A][po:F][ro:E][mp:D]C[reid: Severe mistake for black.  Black does not need to fear this ko fight.  He has at least 8 to ten threats before he even needs to start looking for external threats.  A through C to start with, and then D might even capture 7 white stones outright.  Even if it doesn't succeed, D spawns another 6 or so threats.  Then there's E and F.

White on the other hand, has almost no ko threats.];W[cb];B[mp]

;B[mq];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[lr];W[gq];B[hp];W[fq];B[eq];W[ks]
;B[kr]LB[nr:A][qs:B]C[reid: Better to play at A and see how white responds.  If he protects his corner, black can probably kill the J2 group.  So white has to save his group and black eats out the corner with B.

It works out the same, but you should give your opponenet every chance to make mistakes.]
;W[jr];B[nr];W[er];B[mf]C[I was lucky to get some compensation in lower side, yet, my LR corner is hurt. I lost confidence.

My next move is stupid.

C[reid:  So I hope you can see that go is a game full of possibilities.  There are certainly times when there is only one clear choice, but if you get into the habit of responding automatically, it will severly impede your progress.  Think about every move.

If you can start thinking about higher level strategies, you can make your games a lot more fun and exciting, and you'll challenge people you never thought you could beat!  Try to work one of your opponents weaknesses against another.  He only gets to play once for each of your moves, so try to make your moves count in two battles at the same time!

Good luck, play strong.])

))
(;B[rd];W[qg]LB[rc:A]C[reid: The cut at R13 is difficult for black to handle.  The tricky part is when white later cuts at A.  Black will lose something.]
))
(;LB[qc:C][nd:B][oe:D][pf:A]C[This is a common situation - black has a double approach on the corner 4-4 stone.

Strategic thinking in go is all about cuts and connections.  Why?  Well, it all boils down to life and death.  Making two eyes costs moves - a minimum of 6 stones in the corner, 8 on the side, etc.  

Making eyes for two groups costs twice as many moves.  If black can connect his two groups, he can make them both live and save at least 6 moves compared to making them both live separately.

That's why white wants to keep black separated in this kind of situation.

Moves you see in this position might be A through D.  Given that we already know we don't want black to get D, we can eliminate C.  Choosing from A, B, and D, which one gives us sente?]
;W[oe]C[Of course, one can't say that sente is an absolute - your opponenet can *always* tenuki.  But if he tenukis after white plays P15, white can later play R17 and black has two floating stones with no resources.  It is hard for black to tenuki now.]
;B[qc]LB[pc:A][qd:B]C[This is a common response.  But it doesn't threaten the white stones, so now white can tenuki.  This is what white wanted - sente.

If white were to continue, A or B is usual.  But in this game it is hard to choose.  That makes it even easier for white to tenuki.

Next quiz question: what to do with your sente?];W[qq]LB[ql:C]
[on:D][qn:B][np:E][pp:A][rp:G][nq:F]C[Here is a sequence one often sees in amateur games:  white takes the corner first with A, black approaches with B and white pincers with C.  Black jumps to D and white also jumps with E or F.  Next, black slides in with G, but this is a mistake.

Why?  Because black is now commited to saving three stones and because he has discarded the potential aji of the three-three invasion (this is more significant when white has E compared to F).  Black has given up aji in exchange for a heavy group.

Looking at the game position from white's point oif view, we can see that white can put black into a similar disadvantagous position by using his sente to take the lower three-three.  But it's even better for white because black doesn't yet have D.  The black group cannot easily get eye-shape.

As this fight in the lower-right develops, white will be able to icontrol the game, and later he can choose the correct direction to play in the upper right corner.

As I mentioned in the introduction, I would like you to see the board as a smaller place, where the different tactical situations interact with each other.  This is a perfect example:  white can put black at a strategic and tactical disadvantage on the entire right side. by coordinating his responses in the two corners.

Black's mistake was in rushing to play R14 before completing the lower right corner and stabilizing his group there.  Interestingly, if black does not exchange G for F (S4 for O3), playing at R14 is OK.  It is the failure to follow through on the commitment that G (S4) represents that is the problem here.]
