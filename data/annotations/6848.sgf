GC[Mogo is the computer game (the backend) As frontend i use Drago.

I always loose on even games with Mogo. This time only with 0.5 points.]


C[Marcin: Hello Peter, I''ve never played Mogo, and I will not give You advice how to win with Mogo, but I will try to put some advices for playing against humans ;)
In general, it's not good to play mostly with computers, especialy on full boards - for playing 9x9 I can recommend igowin (good training of reading), and that's it. If you don't like tp play on kgs/igs servers because of time limitations or enything else, I would like to recomment to check DragonGoServer.net, where You can play many games just making your moves and quiting the connection ;)

Comming back to your game - it seems to me that you can improve a lot by looking for big points if you are not in danger.
You will find coments in main game record, and also in some variations ;)
Sorry for poor english,

regards
Marcin];B[dc];W[dj];B[ce];W[im]C[Peter: Mogo has strange moves, but I have no idea how to handle them. At the end all the moves of Mogo are working nice together.]

(;B[qd]C[Peter: I just go to another corner]
(;W[np];B[cp]C[Peter: choose the corner Mogo is surrounding.
Marcin: Right!];W[le]

(;B[eq]C[Marcin: Seems too passive - much slower then white - see variation]
;W[ol]
(;B[qi]C[Marcin: Corner still seems bigger - common opening rule is: Corners, then expansion along sides, then rest of the board.]
;W[jc]
(;B[gc]MA[hc]LB[fc:a]C[Peter: Did not play at X, because of white would play at A, and then i got two running groups. Is this correct or just to territorial?
Marcin: H17 seems better if you are aiming in attacking white stones in central top, which are not stable yet.]
;W[nf];B[pf]LB[qg:a]C[Peter: Later in the game I thought this was not correct. Better at A?
Marcin: Nice shape, a would be too low, but there is no necesity to play defensive moves at all - corner is quite safe, and r11 can defend q14 or r8, so it's time to play something big (maybe bottom right corner?)]
;W[gg]
(;B[ge]C[Marcin: the same - if you want to win, you cannot follow your opponent if it isn't necessary :)]
;W[hf];B[lc]MA[oh][dm][qp]C[Marcin: M17 stone gives nice continuation with l16, but maybe it was to early - bottom right corner still is bigger, other moves are sente because they are aiming at destroying white center....]
