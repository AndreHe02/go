C[Hi!

Thx in advance for reviewing my game. You can focus on the beginning of the game since I think the major decisions were made there. You can also use my questions and comments as a guidance to what to explain. If you see any major mistakes I didn't even notice just feel free to point them out.

Just review for white.

Comments by Az];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq];W[ce];B[qj];W[nc]
;B[pf];W[jd];B[fq];W[cn]LB[dn:A]C[Az: For balance I'd prefer 'a', but this is probably fine too.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[ne];B[ng];W[oo]C[This is the first issue for me as white: How to invade into black's moyo without getting into pressure too early? I did chosse p5 as you can see. Are there better alternatives?

Az: I see nothing wrong with this, though the follow up was a debacle. This is a vital point for reduction, and you're not ready to only work on one side since the other would likely become territory. Invasion is not good, but you need to address the growing moyo soon.]
;B[pn]C[Now here begins a sequence till move 36 I'm not sure I did everything right. I ended up living with one group but lost other stones and helped to increase black's moyo on the right side. Please review if I played correctly or where a mistake was made.

Az: Mistakes. Plural.];W[nq];B[op]
(;W[np]C[Az: Mistake #1. This is heavy, you're not trying to hold on to all of - or even any of - your original stones when you make a reduction like this. You are trying to make light efficent shape and avoid getting in a spot where black can put a lot of pressure on you.]
;B[no];W[on]C[Az: Mistake #2. Worse than mistake #1. You are fighting *IN BLACKS AREA*, not in your area. W cannot take an uncompromising line like this when outnumbered. The p5 stone doesn't matter at all before you extend here, now you have two heavy groups close to each other.]
;B[mo];W[pm]C[Az: It is hard to pick a side, since you painted yourself into a corner here and then gave the walls a coat just to make sure. This is probably the right side, white should probably write off the 2 stones bellow and then try to use the aji to reduce later.]
;B[po]
(;W[qm]C[Az: Mistake #3. Have you no fear at all? This is another heavy move, which once again has awful eye shape potential. You need to be running away here.]
;B[om];W[nn]C[Az: Mistake #4. The two stones are dead weight which might have sacrafice value. If white read this out then he hallucinated, if he didn't they what is he doing? This just makes black play the atari he wanted to anyway (he didn't in game, I don't know why not, see var).]
(;B[ol];W[or];B[pr];W[nr];B[qq];W[kq]
(;B[mm];W[hp]C[Az: Overplay. The idea is clear, elegant, and totally unreasonable since you have a group of stones without well defined eyes next door. Black shouldn't even think about answering submissively until you've paid your dues and make the O4 group live.]
(;B[hq];W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[gq];W[eq];B[jp]C[Az: Better late than never. White didn't respect his weak stones here.]
;W[jr]LB[lr:A]C[Az: If B 'a' right now, the aji is still bad, though you can live with only a bit of hurt since B N7 was in the wrong spot.]
;B[er]
(;W[ho]C[Az: This is not good, you are saving a stone that isn't important and just driving black to reinforce in ways that make white unhappy.]
;B[mp];W[lr];B[ci]C[Az: Was H5 worth it? (Rhetorical question). Now the wall is not working effectively at all.]
;W[ck]LB[dj:A][dk:B]C[After the game I don't think my approach with the marked stone was good. I think a move at A or B would have been more appropriate for white...or should I even have pressed from the oppostite side...what do you think?

Az: This is as good as anything, but the root of the problem was that you passed when you needed to be extending here first. Thats the reason why there is no good move for white here now.]
;B[ei];W[gi]LB[gd:A]C[Az: Overplay. White is not doing so well, so perhaps its understandable, but that doesn't make it a reasonable move. Better to wait and see what kinds of mistakes black will make if given time. Its difficult to say how best to play instead, there are a lot of lukewarm moves, but something like 'a' might be better since it would make this into a real threat while getting you something tangible from the attack instead of just attacking and hoping it'll benefit you.]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[ek];W[el]LB[cj:A]C[Az: Straight out of the question. 'a' is the vital point for both sides, after ceeding it to black he is nearly alive and white has incurred a net *loss* of territory due to the huge endgame follow up moves which 'a' creates for black.]
;B[cj];W[bk]LB[gk:A]C[Az: There's no need to be greedy, if your opp just jumps to 'a' its curtains.]
;B[dg];W[fk];B[ee];W[fd];B[cf];W[de];B[fj];W[gj];B[df];W[fe]
;B[be];W[bd];B[bf]LB[mg:B][nj:C][qc:A]C[Az: White played as well as he could here. Theres no chance of a killing attack on something like that, but you got more than you would have if black had just jumped out and given you sente. Tenuki is the obvious move now, since adding a stone in the corner is just a yose move and you need to get to big points on the board before that. 'a' is the most obvious big move, you could also think about 'b' afterward but you'd need to do some serious counting first. (if 'b' leaves you down, then you need to try something like 'c' to try to revive some aji in your two stones).]
;W[cd]C[I think this move in the corner was quite slow considering how big black'S moyo could become in the center...was that move OK or which alternatives would've been better?]
;B[lg];W[kj]C[This is basically my last question. I need to reduce black's moyo here...is my move alright?

Az: At least one line deeper is necessary, but invading r17 is more urgent.]
