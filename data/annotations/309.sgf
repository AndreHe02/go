KM[5.5];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[jq];B[cn];W[cl]C[I think i  should have played this
stone higher around w  d10.];B[en];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[bq];W[br]C[J: I'd have left this for later in  the
game and made a bigger move elsewhere.];B[lq]C[J: Gote and not as big as  playing in the
other large open areas.];W[dh];B[fc];W[nc];B[pf];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob]
;W[qb];B[oc];W[qe]C[This turned out bad for me. w s15 was
joseki and would have worked better i  think.];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[rb];B
[re];W[sd];B[se];W[sc];B[qf]C[Yuck he has a  wall  in both directions.]
;W[qm]C[Here I was aiming at w  o3.
J: But black can next make a dual purpose
move at R9 or R10, pincering white and extending
from his wall. Black is very strong below and
can chase white, making territory. I'm not sure
what the best tactic is, but I'd play around Q10
making a light reducing move that can easily run.];B[pj]C[J: Should be one to  the right I think.
White has room to slide underneath this.];W[nq]C[J: Don't begrudge black his  points on the
bottom. R7 is too weak to help an attack.
Make a lighter reduction (higher) and thus
aid R7.];B[op];W[mp];B[lp];W[lo];B[ko];W[kp]C[J: You needed to protect against the  N5
cut instead. Then black must protect
against this move and you get yet another
move, perhaps linking N4, etc. with R7 and
making black worry about life in the corner.];B[mo];W[ln]C[J: Try some  variations if you play O5
instead here.];B[mq];W[np];B[no];W[nr];B[mr];W[ms]C[This turned out bad.  I think w L3
would have done the trick  though.];B[ls];W[ns];B[kq];W[jp];B[kr];W[qr]
C[This was another botched  attempt at
saving o3 but it ended up giving
a bit of return anyway.];B[or];W[jr]C[I wonder if I should  have done something
bigger here.
J: This was very big, probably a needed play.];B[ic];W[pr]C[Here i should  have done  something bigger
also but i was still blinded with  disapointment at loosing  o3.];B[os]
;W[rq];B[rp];W[ps];B[oq];W[rs];B[om];W[oe]C[You never know when a  peep can  help.]
;B[pe];W[jn]C[Here i thought defend so i can do strong
attacking in the near future.
J: I'd have thought about playing O18
first since it's nearly a sente move, just
to get a bit stronger on top, otherwise,
P15 seems pointless.];B[db];W[eb]C[This was an attempt to get  sente so i could play w f15. But it didn't  work.]
;B[ec];W[dc]C[J: E18 let's you play C18, not D17 here.];B[cb];W[bc];B[nd]
C[Hee hee. f15 would have been big for him
but those peeping stones distracted him.];W[fe];B[gd];W[ge];B[he];W[el]
C[J:  Good area to play in, build up moyo
and attack at the same time.];B[hf]C[What luck! now I can try to kill
black in the bottom  left.];W[fm];B[fn];W[gn];B[bm];W[bl];B[km];W[kn]C[I didn't want his moyo to  get to  big.]
;B[lm];W[mn]C[This didn't seem to serve much  purpose.
J: If you want to play in this area,
N7 leaves more aji.];B[mm];W[jl];B[jm];W[im];B[nn];W[in];B[fg];W[ef];B[gg]
;W[nl]C[I recently read a book on attack
and defence so I am peeping all over.
J: Peeps can hurt too, or be no help;
always try to see if the expected black
response just helps black and also if a
very nearby placement first would let you
make the peep in sente as a followup move
with better results, that way you control
the sequence better.];B[nm];W[lk]C[This move seems weak to me. Maybe w k10  would be better.
J: Usually it's better not to try to do
much with the peeping stone right away.
In this case there are a number of moves
around Q10 that can use O8 indirectly
and make a big dent in black's right side.];B[ml];W[jj];B[nf]C[I wonder what  black was fraid of to  make that move.
J: Black was looking at the aji of a cut
at P16 since the ladder doesn't work.
White might start with O18 and use the
treat of the cut to activate O17/O18.];W[mk];B[nk];W[nj];B[ok];W[og];B[ni]

first.];B[kf];W[jg];B[ep];W[eq];B[fo];W[eo];B[do];W[ep];B[dm];W[cp];B[co]
;W[cm];B[an];W[bo];B[aq];W[ar];B[dl];W[dk];B[ck]C[Uh oh. Thing started  getting a little  complicated.]
;W[em];B[al];W[dn]C[J: Why not B9 instead, white can capture
either way to escape then and black is
weaker.];B[bk];W[bn]C[J: This move wasn't urgent yet.];B[ci];W[ch];B[bi]
;W[bh];B[gi];W[fj]C[Here greed said play w g10 but i was
afraid of the cut and  the b10 group
somehow escaping so i played safer.];B[gj];W[gk]C[

Now it is my turn to suffer a little.];W[ac];B[bf]C[
 jjoe 18k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[ad]C[J: If you had played D19 instead,  black
can connect underneath, but a throw-in
at A13 or recapture at A15 after black A16
means there's no eye on the edge. I then see
only one eye for the whole black dragon, no?];B[ba];W[ce];B[hi]C[Sigh,  no big ko threats at all.]
