AB[dd][jd][gg][dj][jj]C[The main point is, how to make my lower right group live :)

All advices are welcome ! Thx for reviewing my game.

E: I am not nearly as strong as you opponenet in this game, so I cannot predict the much better responses that a 3d would likely make.  Also, cannot recall ever playing 13 X 13, though I understand that some people do so.  Finally, the blitz timing for the game, is not the best to review, as so mistakes might have been made due to haste.  I will review this game.  I woud reccomend that you play a game against someone you think is your own strength, on a 19 X 19 board, and submit that for a review.

E: Starting thoughts.  In a high handicap game such as this, you can follow a strategy of protecting you own stones or attacking you opponents stones.  Generally, on a small board, the game is much more fighting.]
;W[gd]C[Taucetil [?\]: bonsoir
telchar [3d?\]: salut
telchar [3d?\]: bonne partie];B[ec]C[E: This is a fine response.  The corner is near certain territory and the white stone will have trouble making a base.]
;W[jf];B[ke]TR[gg]C[E: Again fine.  Notice there are now two white and two black stones in the upper right quarter (not countering the tengen/triangle stone).]
;W[kf]
(;B[kh]TR[ke]C[E: You cannot ignore the attachment to your stone.  If you wanted to give away the upper right corner, it would have been better to not have played the triangle stone.]
;W[hf];B[gj]C[E: This move suggests that you are willing to conceed the upper right corner in exchange for the bottom half.]
;W[hc];B[jc]TR[kh][gj]C[E: Now the respnse means that the upper right corner can live, but it will be small.   Perhaps inconsistant with two other plays.  Also, following the larger strategy to keep your handicap stones alive is OK.  Notice that white is now able to connect all stones in play.]
;W[df]
(;B[ch]TR[be][ce]C[E: I like a play at the triangled locations better]
;W[eg]
(;B[cf]C[Should I protect the corner at C10 instead ?

E: Yes, attaching to strong stones underneath is odd unless you have a way to threaten to kill them.]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[bf]
(;B[bd]TR[cg]C[E: It was urgent to play C7.  The ponuki shape fairly guarantees that whit is alive.  B10 is a very small move.]
;W[cg]
(;B[dh]C[E: This strengthens the stone that white attached, but is in the wrong direction.  White does not care about this peep.]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[gk]
(;B[fk]TR[ik]C[E:  Your initial question was how to save your bottom right corner.  Perhaps J3 on this move instead.  While the black stone was attached, it can still go to either side.]
;W[hj];B[hk];W[gl];B[hl];W[fj]
(;B[fl]TR[gi]C[E: G5 was urgernt.  White now has certain life and a larger center of the board.]
;W[gi];B[ej];W[fm];B[em];W[gm];B[el]TR[hk][hl]C[E: A good sequence that secures the bottom left corner at the possible expense of the marked stones.  White now has a powerful cneter and is leaning against the bottom right corner.]
;W[jl]TR[kh][jj]C[How to handle the next phase correctly and save this group ?

E: It may not be possible at this stage.  Black has a very weak group attached to white's strength at the bottom.  The marked stones are fairly surrounded.  but let us try.]
;B[kk]C[E: This I might have done as well: it looks like the right move, unfortunately, it seems not to work.]
;W[kl]
(;B[ll]TR[lk]C[E: Perhaps the variation playing the marked location workes better here.]
;W[lj]LB[kf:A][kh:C][lj:B]TR[lh][jl][kl]C[E: This invasion is possible due to the A stone.  Without a response, it is always possible to link A & B.  Really, the only way perhaps possible might be to kill the marked stones.]
