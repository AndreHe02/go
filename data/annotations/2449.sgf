C[I was playing as white. I have annotated the game already with what I was trying to do and what I think might have been better moves.

This game was played on the Dragon Go Server, so it was turn-based. I was playing a couple of other games at the same time, and definitely got a little stronger over the course of the game.

Hi, hope my comments can help you out :)];B[pc];W[cp];B[qp]
;W[dc];B[kc];W[jp]C[I'm going for a slightly higher enclosure here and in my next move]
;B[qj];W[dj];B[cf];W[ce]TR[dj][dc]C[Seems like there's still time to enclose my corner here; I've got enough support down at d10, and of course at d17,  to survive the attachment (I hope)

I dont really like this move, you shouldnt touch the stone you are attacking because it is likely to get stronger, instead try to attack it from a distance and still make solid territory. C16 seems like a better option.]
;B[ci];W[dm]TR[dj]C[Protect d10];B[di];W[ef]C[Try to limit black's framework

Yes, you are in fact enclosing black, altought black can ignore your move for a turn and play C10 that looks big or even D14 threathing the cut. Your E10 stone looks lonely...]
;B[dg];W[eh];B[dh];W[bj]C[Always try to think a better alternative than playing in the 2nd line, as it is the line of defeat...
One rule of thumb to estabilish who is losing is whoever has more stones in the 2nd line, because those stones make little territory and almost no influence... besides here you make a gap at C10 where black can push and create even more cutting points in order to escape to the center.

Always try to contain, dont just go for the kill unless you are sure you can kill.]
;B[bi];W[ei]C[This loose enclosure seems to have kept  black hemmed in pretty well so far

Yes, whoever the gap is still there...];B[be]C[Now black tries to make more room for these stones to live

Black is already alive, no need for more room. 
Black could play elsewhere if he wanted to.]
(;W[bd]C[I think this was a mistake. I wanted to keep black hemmed in as much as possible, but this move was too weak. I think c16 would have been best, to maintain influence towards the center/right. d15 would have been stronger too, but would have left the corner more open to black without (I think) being that much stronger towards the center.

C16 and D15 both moves, allow black to move towards the center, but C16 is more solid and protects the corner better.]
;B[cd]C[Oops.];W[cc]C[My plan is to limit the damage by forcing black to fill in the eye in two moves. I see this a lot in amateur games, but I don't know if it's a good idea. Is there a rule of thumb about this?

More a less, in this situation it is a solution, because it makes black heavy while containing it.]
;B[de];W[dd];B[ce];W[ad]C[not the best move in the situation, E 15 connects you stones and is more urgent. Also gote because you will need another move at B18 after black play at A15.]
;B[ae];W[hd]MA[bc]C[Should have protected the cutting point at b17. I think I see this more often now than I did a couple of weeks ago when I made that move.]
;B[bc];W[cb]C[Since I'm going to lose the string at A16, at least I'll try to jump ahead with a strong wall in the corner here to finish this section off before moving to the next big moves. Also, I think I need to do something to protect the string at d17.

In this case forciing the capture of the 2 stones with a move at B18 is better, allowing for eye space.]
;B[bb];W[ba];B[ac];W[ee]C[The situation so far is more a less equal... Black got a a few points on the side but you got a great wall and need to expolit it.]
;B[qe];W[fq]MA[fp]C[Is this too low? F4 seemed too high, but maybe I was confused about my goals. I was trying to get territory and influence both at once.

This move is probably the right one if you wanted to protect the corner, play F4 if you want to try making territory and influence towards the center.]
;B[mq];W[jc]MA[ke]C[Another case where I'm hoping the attachment is okay because I'm bolstered by the nearby stone at H16. I was afraid that if I tried to cap at L15, I wouldn't be able to live. It seemed like the diagonal at K16 would have been vulnerable to black going under at K17.

Again, touched your opponents stone while attacking, playing at the center (k10) seems bigger and might pressure your opponent to try invading your framework.]
;B[kd];W[jd];B[nn]C[Seems like a good move by black to extend out to the center and strengthen the lower right corner.]
;W[kg]C[I'm trying to stretch to the center, make a potential framework in the area
 around H13, and cut black's group at L16 from the lower group.]
;B[lf];W[ke];B[le];W[kf];B[ld];W[lj]C[So far you have been doing great in making a huge framework.]
;B[kn];W[jm]C[To protect the nascent framework on the lower left

Necessary move.];B[ll];W[kk]C[Also good.];B[mk];W[mh];B[ni]
;W[mi];B[eg];W[fg];B[kp];W[jo];B[ko];W[kr]C[Maybe this is too low. I want to threaten a reduction of black's framework while growing my own.

Its a good move that you should play, but think bigger, like N13, or N12.]
;B[lr];W[nh]C[Trying to invade the upper right slowly but strongly. Otherwise I'm afraid that black's area in the upper left will diminish my territory on the left half of the board enough that I'll be behind at the end.]
;B[oh];W[nj];B[oi];W[mj];B[nk];W[oj]C[I want to threaten the black string at P11 as well as invasion downwards.]
;B[ok];W[pj];B[pi];W[pk];B[pl];W[qk];B[ql];W[rk];B[rj];W[qi]
;B[ri];W[qh];B[pg];W[rh]C[Very good sequence :) as you captured the 3 stones.]
;B[sk]C[S8 seems a good play.]
(;W[sl];B[rl]C[At this point, if you are positive that you wont be able to invade black below, you should extend to T7 and onwards if black lets you.]

(;W[sj];B[sm];W[sk];B[rn]C[Now it seems like I won't be able to invade the lower right at all. Could I have done something lighter or more aggressive to prevent black from getting that thick wall around R8?]
;W[of];B[pf];W[qg];B[rf];W[od]C[I'm trying to stretch into the top loosely, to make my presence possible, then fill in when black plays at places like Q15. I'm not sure if this really puts me ahead, though. I see a lot of very slow, thick connections in games at
my level. What's the better approach?

You should play loose only if your opponent isnt strong in the area, as it is this case.]
;B[pd];W[oe];B[pe];W[oc]MA[ob]C[I don't think I could have played at P18 because a black stone at P17 would leave me stranded. So now I'm stuck moving slowly again.]
;B[ob];W[nc];B[mc];W[nb]MA[ng][og]C[I'm aware of the weakness at P13, but I think I can connect later through all the open space around O13.

If you think believe black will protect his 4 stones, play O13 as soon as possible, and then play elsewhere as a play at N13 his capturable.]
;B[mb];W[oa];B[pb];W[na]C[At this point connection is not necessary and L18 is big and sente, and might lead to the death of the black group.]
;B[jb];W[og];B[ph];W[ib];B[ia];W[hb]C[Altough you played safe, playing at L18 is good.]
;B[mf];W[ne]MA[ng]C[A little over-excited there. I want to keep black from making any eyes in this area, and it seems like my chances are good. What I didn't see was that the play at N14 left me with only one chance to connect my string at O19 to the one at O12.

Thats true, you missed the vital connection after a play that enabled once again O13 by black.]
;B[ng]C[Now I'm sunk. Only 5 liberties in my top string, while black has tons more.

While your group is dead, unless black plays it out bad, you can take the opportunity to force black to capture it by attacking in the outside. Meanwhile think that sometime in the future you have to play at C10 or else black will make your life miserable... :P]
;W[ha]C[Try to limit the incursions of this now potentially very strong black group.]
;B[ja]C[Bad play by black, you can play L18 and capture the 3 stones.]
;W[kb];B[ma]C[At this point you can toy around a little and see if you can save your group,  extend to L18 and see how black reacts. No need to capture at this time as the black stones are still dead despite M19.]
;W[ka];B[hh]C[This seemed like a risky move to me. Black had nothing around, while I've got stones in every direction.

Yes its in fact risky but black need to invade to win the game. He is trying to make good use of the cutting points at F12 and F14 and the hole at C10.]
;W[gl];B[gj];W[ji];B[ii];W[ij]C[Attach->hane.];B[hj];W[ih]C[Now I think I've got the initiative. Maybe I had it a couple of moves back already?

That hane was a bit agressive as you are again left with several cutting points...]
;B[hi]MA[fh][ej]C[I don't think black can make any eyes now. Even though I've got some cutting points on the left group, it seems like I'm ahead of the game here.]
;W[ig];B[fh];W[gg];B[ej];W[fi];B[gh];W[fj]C[I'm driving black into my territory, but I can't play atari at E9, and I can't let black play here at F10.]
;B[ek];W[fk];B[dk]
(;W[bk]C[Was this a mistake? I think I was afraid of being caught if I connected at C10.

Lets play it out.];B[cj];W[cl]C[Now I've got more thickness towards the left, but I gave up a couple of poi
nts for it. Probably came out ahead in the trade.

Yes but you now have a problem as black got stronger in your area... and you still have an entrace to your territory at E7]
;B[ck];W[bl]C[Avoid the cut. Now I've lost the initiative.]
;B[ik];W[jj];B[fl];W[fm];B[el];W[gk];B[em];W[hk]C[I'm afraid that if I don't play here, black will. Then the string at H11 will suddenly have enough liberties to pose a threat.]
;B[kl];W[jl];B[km]C[Seems unnecessary. I couldn't invade here, so why not extend the group over at E7?

Exactly, take the opportunity to minize the damages. Probably play F6.]
;W[gm]C[Suddenly realized I was almost in atari];B[en];W[do]
;B[fo];W[go]C[Now I definitely feel strong enough in this area to play close. My aim is to make territory.]
;B[dn];W[cn];B[dl];W[cm];B[fp];W[gp];B[eo];W[dp];B[kq];W[jr]
C[Keep black in check while also avoiding atari];B[jq]
(;W[ir]C[I think my stones were still in danger (see variation). Not sure if I was right, though, and I definitely wasn't reading as far ahead as I played the variation.]
;B[iq];W[hq]TR[fq][gp][jp]C[Didn't count it, but with three stones in the bottom string, now it seems like I could weather a hane at the left edge. This stone at H3 also helps the other nearby groups.]
;B[ip];W[io];B[hp];W[ho];B[ks];W[js]C[I can force here and still keep the initiative

Thats not completly true...]
(;B[ls]
(;W[gr]C[This felt very important];B[pq];W[sg]C[Still seems like I can't do anything in the lower right. So try to reduce black's territory on the upper right. Now maybe my doomed string at O18 can help provide pressure as I invade.]
;B[sf];W[rg];B[rd]C[Okay, maybe my doomed string can't provide much help after all.]
;W[ai];B[ah];W[aj];B[bg];W[mg]MA[nf]C[It definitely feels like endgame. Force black to fill in P14]
;B[nf];W[lg];B[qf]MA[si]C[Now black makes me fill in T11];W[si]
;B[lb]C[Black gets a point];W[jn];B[fn];W[gn]MA[po][pp][op]
[oo]C[This territory of mine around H7 sure has shrunk compared to earlier. Maybe black's invasion with the H11 string wasn't such a bad idea after all. Was there anything similar I could have done around Q4?

There is now way you can invade there... :)];B[me]MA[ep]C[I would have gone at E4 as black.]
;W[ep];B[pa]C[This one also seemed unnecessary. My string is clearly dead. Even if not, had I played at Q19, black could stop me at R18.]
;W[hg]C[Secure one more point for myself.

Not necessay black is dead, you are filling you own territory.]
;B[nd];W[lk]C[All I see now is dame];B[ml];W[la]MA[ca]C[Black passed at this point. I think C19 was still not mine, but it seemed impolite to play after a pass. What's the best thing to do in this case?

Its not considered impoilte, in my opinion to play after a pass, it just means your opponent didnt realized that there are still points to be had.
In this case playing there actually takes a point from you, so you can also pass.

In general it was a good game, where both you and your opponent both made mistakes, altough yours costed you a group... 

You will get better by playing more :)

Hope my review helped you.])
