C[black felt "kicked around" in this game.

black can see a number of tactical errors that he made, but is more interested in an appraisal of the strategy suggested by his moves.

black feels that white made overplays on several occasions, noted in his own comments on the game, but is unsure as to whether or not these were in fact overplays.

Hi David,

It's not always easy to see if a move "is" or "is not" an overplay. Also, this kind of move can be intentional or not. All players make overplays sometimes (even pro players) and if the opponent answers well he will be able to take some profit on it. So, don't be afraid or angry about that.

Well, these moves looks like yose ; but it's not the time for it.
It's too small...

A move around K3 is far better];W[ek];B[cm];W[cj]LB[dj:A]C[is this an overplay? should black cut at A?

an overplay, or just a move to test you

3 advices to improve your game: 
1. To make points the best way is to built his own territorry ; not to remove the opponent one (See for example Move 7: L17, Move 11: H17, Move 33: B4).
Have a positive way of playing.
2. When some opponent groups are weaks, you have to work hard to find a way to get some compensation or to keep a good yose sente(Cf. Move 144,...)
3. With a better yose, black can still have a chance (yose begin at around move 102) ; studying yose problems is a good way to progress.

This plan doesn't means Black have to succeed... Just keeping white under pressure while making some points in sente is probably enought]
