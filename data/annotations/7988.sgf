C[Hi, thanks for looking at my game.  I've put a few questions in at different points in the game.  I'm particularly interested in my middle game tactics, as it seems to me that I had a leed after the opening, and any other comments that you have are of course gladly welcomed.

Hi Noah!
I'm Peter Martin and I'll be reviewing your game. Hope you find my comments helpful. Please don't hesitate to ask follow-up questions. 

General comments on the game for black:
Black played very aggresively in this game. White had opportunity to punish black for this but it didn't happen (lucky for black). 
It appears that black has been very much focused on taking territory away from the opponent. You have to be careful: don't be so greedy. Take your time. 
Black should probably look at the whole board and re-evaluate biggest areas of the board where a stick in the ground can be placed. The top area was ignored for too long in the opening. Black also helped white few times in fixing problem areas. Avoid helping the opponent. In some instances both players played moves that had very little value. Always look at the whole board and keep ALL AREAS in mind. 
Hope this helps.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[po]LB[qm:A]C[PETE: This opening leaves the spot at A more vonurable for approach. What black is getting in return is more influence for the bottom side. This is a typical trade-off.]
;W[jq];B[qj]LB[fc:A][qj:B]C[PETE: Playing at A is also an option. It is a matter of style I think. Playing at B says "I have my framework, come in and I'll attack you". Playing at A says: "I am not that concerned about my framework -- it will form itself later. I am now going after you! you must defend".]
;W[cj]
(;B[hq]LB[fc:D][jd:C][hp:B][jq:E][lq:A]C[This move ended up working out for me I suppose, but at the time I wasn't completely confident about it.  I considered playing at A, but it looked like a cramped extension from my corner and seemed like it would give him a good move extending towards his corner.  I also thought that if I played closer to his corner than I did that he would get a good response protecting his corner while attacking my stone.  Maybe B or tenuki would be better?

PETE: I would play at C or D. Look at the left, right and bottom sides. They are all symetricly occupied. What's the last open area? It is the top of course. Unless one of your groups is in danger you should look (during first 15 moves or so) always look for the most open area to play in. By playing at B black is almost saying: lets play this way: if your plan was to pincer me with E after this move, I will save you one move :)
It is much safer for black to play at A. As it happened in this game, white will take adventage of the fact that black came inside white's sphere of stones. White will push the black stone around and gain something from it. Playing at A does not allow white to do this. Also playing at the top is a lot bigger right now (as I mentioned above).]

;W[kp];B[ko];W[lp];B[lo];W[mo]C[PETE: white gets beautiful shapes.]
;B[jn];W[mm]LB[qm:A]C[To here I was somewhat satisfied with the thickness that I had developed, but in addition to territory he also got N7 which hurt me in the long term.

PETE: I think white came out way ahead here. White can form at least one eye (two in gote perhaps). Black does not have an eye and might end up floating in the middle looking to live. Black does not have influence until it gets strong. This is very important cocept to understand. If your wall is not strong, you cannot use it for influence (meaining: fighting). You could not push white stones towards your center stones because that would put your center stones in danger, right? So those stones have very little influence right now. And yes, white later jumps into A because the white center stones becomes safe and white does not have to worry about them any more. White will only make few points of territory at the bottom. White's gain is not about territory. It is about making black center stones weak AND being able to jump in at A later.]
;B[cl]LB[cl:D][cn:C][cp:A][cq:B]C[PETE: top side is a lot more important right now. 
Eventually black could try to invade on the left but not here. Instead typical invasion is at A or B. Black could also approach at C. Playing at D is just very strange.]

[ch][dh][eh][di][ei]C[Was this a bad move?  I wanted to protect my cutting point while at least threatening his corner, but the connection needed more reenforcement later on anyway.  I also considered invading at 3-3 or a similar move to remove his eyespace in the corner, but I was worried for the D8 group in that case.

PETE: the move is OK. You have to remember that you started by playing a black stone close to 3 white stones. You have to expect to get pushed around of course! There are trade-off right? Your opponent has to get something BIG in return unless he makes a mistake. If you are wondeing about the move at A (was it good or not), you have to first answer this question: what was the purpose of the move at B when you made it? Was it just to reduce white's territory (invasion?). If so, are going going to continue with your plan or change it now? If you change your plan the opponent might take advantage of the fact that some of your stones are not working efficiently for the new plan. That's why changing plans is not good. That's why having a solid plan in the begining is improtant. If all you wanted to do is to invade, that's not good enough plan at this stage of the game. It is too early for black to say "I'm just going to play here because it allows me to take points away from white here". White has SO MANY options left that he can take this invasion and say, "fine, take all that. I'll build a wall on the other side and create 2x the territory you just took away and it will be more solid than this". So be very careful. In the begining you cannot play moves like the one at B. First you have to make sure white does not have ability to make that huge territory on the other side (where the marked stones are). THEN you can invade around A or closer to the corner.]

(;B[fm]C[PETE: black should think about sacrafising some stones to make good shape and connect with the center stones.]

;W[dq];B[cr]
(;W[br];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp]LB[cl:B][hq:A]C[PETE: Great outcome for black! The center group which had bad aji around it is no longer in trouble. So black made up the disadvantage moves at A and B should have brought upon!]
;W[cd]LB[fc:C][nc:B][jd:A][eg:D]C[PETE: white should have played at A or B. This is too early to claim territory. Black can come in at C or reduce at D any time. Big moves that keep your options open are more important than solid local moves to only secure small terrotory.]
(;B[jc]LB[ec:F][fc:A][hc:C][cd:D][dd:E][fd:B]C[PETE: good move but I would plauy at A or B. On the next move white plays at C which works very well with the corner enclosure of the D and E stones. So here black allowed white to fix earlier mistake of over-concentrating. If black played this move at A, it would continue to force white to overconcentrate (white might play at F to secure corner territory). This would be great for black. White would end up way over-concentrated. So remember: don't help your opponent his his mistakes. If something looks a little weird to you, analyze it and see if there is a way to take small adventage. You do not have to gain 100 points or kill a big group. Just gain enough adventage to win the game. That's why pros win/lose by only 5 pts or less!]
;W[hc];B[mc];W[qm]LB[jc:B][om:A]C[Maybe I should've played to prevent this earlier?  Or would something around A be better to attack this stone rather than extending?

PETE: when you say "earlier", which move do you think you could skip. The only one I see is maybe B.]

(;B[fd]LB[fc:C][kg:D][ll:B][mm:A]C[I played here with the dual purpose of serving as a ladder break from A as well as attacking the corner, maybe something like R16 to take the corner would be bigger?

I also think that I probably mishandled the ensuing fight pretty badly, letting him destroy my thickness at the bottom while sealing in the stone at F16


PETE: Don't need ladder for stone at A. If black plays at B the stone at A is captured (lose ladder).
Typical invasion is at C but in this case you should think about attacking stone at D while taking away territory from white on the left side.]
;W[id]LB[db:C][hb:B][fc:A]C[PETE: this is why invasion at A is safer: you can connect at B or play at C to make an eye. Playing on 4th line forces black to run to the center.]
