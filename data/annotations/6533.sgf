C[hello, thank you for takign the time to do a review. I have been on a severe losing streak adn I always seem to lose it the same why, either when the oppnant plays desperation moves or i just cannot play well in the yose, so for me this may be key points.

Scott

Hi Scott,

I seem to have the same problem lately ;-) I'm sure I'll learn a lot by looking at this game, too! I'll focus on white but will comment on black if there's something too obvious.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[cj];W[cm];B[cf];W[gc]C[responding this way is my usual habbit

I think that's fine];B[dh]C[this seemed slow to me so I was keen to take advantage]

C[M 15 is bad. R17 is now perfect]
(;W[lb]C[I thought this to connect 0 17, but in hindsight it is not so good as I can see that there is no conenction]

(;B[pc];W[mc];B[pg];W[qk]C[the black left was stoarting to look intolerable to me, so I played here to reduce it while leaving myself enough room to try and get out

I's very hard to find a good spot for white to play in here. You shouldn't have allowed Q13 in the first place. I'd probably play O3 instead of R9]
;B[qm]C[now you can see that R9 was badly placed];W[qh];B[qg]

(;W[lq]C[I thought that group was safe, turns out later it was nto as safe as I thought it was.

It's OK to move on, but you gotta watch out.M3 doesn't seem good. O3 better, I think, or Q3 or R3.]
;B[nq];W[ip]

(;W[dc]C[I choose this direction because I felt getting more at teh top wsa better]
;B[cd]C[black gains tons of territory now];W[bk]C[this is unidimensional move, slow, since black stones are now solid]
;B[de];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[gp]C[good move. Might be better than F3 that I thought of earlier.]

(;W[dr];B[fq]C[after this the game is quite hopeless for white. J4, P10 and C7 groups are unsettled, and all black groups are solid, and black has more territory.]

I tend to start this kind of moves when I get desparate. But they have no benefit for white. You are not in a state to get the middle unless you are solid all around.]
