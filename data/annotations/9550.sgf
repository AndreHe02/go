C[MR: I included comments in the game always starting with "MR".

MR: The game works well for white as he gets influence while black gets four corners (until move 64).
Black tries to establish groups within the white moyo - and finally succeeds to get all his stones to live (and by this to win the game).
However, there are several opportunities for white to capture half of the stones and by this to win the game.]

MR: Black has more clear territory, so white does need to get "something" from the middle. The upper area is open at O18 and K12, so most likely there will not be much territory for white here. also, white's group around O14 does not have two eyes yet. The lower edge could give some territory to white if he plays N3 first. But black is in the nice position that he only has to reduce white's potential territory by running into it from secure black groups, like around M5/N5. 

Therefore, it would have been better to allow black to capture the stones M10 and securely capture the left side group around E9.]

MR: "Avoid in general" is impossible. I did indicate several moves where you could have played differently to settle the situation. Sometimes, there would have been "compromises" to take one group for sure and allow the other one to live. At other times, playing double purpose moves (attack while making territory) would have been possible.]
