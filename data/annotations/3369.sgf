AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hyoga: hello



H : I'll note my own comments with "H:". This was my first 9 stone handicap game against someone strong. I mainly tried to stay composed, not make too many mistakes, play conservatively and try to make it difficult for white to make territory.

Please feel free to make any comment that could be of use. Thanks a lot.



Hello, my name is Darrell.  I've glanced the game over and would say you are quite a lot stronger than 26k.  Basically, you played quite a solid game without any major errors.]
;W[pm];B[np];W[dg];B[fd];W[gp];B[hq]LB[dn:A][iq:B]C[Here I would prefer a or b rather than making contact with the weak white stone.  You end up strengthening white and weakening your corner this way.]
;W[gq];B[hp];W[go];B[cm]LB[dn:B][eq:A]C[The large knight move you made here leaves the corner quite open at the 3-3 point.  I like a move at a or b better as they put more pressure on the three white stones and lead to a stronger corner.]
;W[ho];B[cf]LB[eq:A]C[Although tenuki (playing away) is certainly possible, why not keep the pressure on the white group?]
;W[cg];B[df];W[fg]
(;B[gj]LB[eq:A]C[This is a bit far away from the action.  Again, I would prefer to put some pressure on the group on the bottom.   See variation]
;W[hg];B[cj];W[hd]
(;B[ic]C[Wrong side.  You are forcing white to hurt your weakest group further.  Granted, it isn't all that weak, but it is the weakest.]
;W[hc];B[kc];W[ge];B[fc];W[pg];B[nd];W[lp]
(;B[lq]C[H : I would have liked to connect here, but, is that a correct move?

It certainly didn't work out well.  Instead, I would move out into the middle and keep the three white groups weak.  See variation.]
;W[kq];B[kp]C[H : I chose to strenghten the lower side because I felt the corner was quite safe at the moment.]
;W[mq];B[lr];W[mp];B[nq];W[mr];B[kr];W[nr];B[qn];W[qm]
(;B[rn]LB[nn:A];W[nn]C[Now you are surrounded and have to live.  White is connected.  This is a large stratic loss.]
;B[rl];W[qk];B[ql];W[rm];B[sm];W[pn];B[pk]C[Good.];W[mg];B[qf]
;W[qg];B[rf];W[rg];B[jn];W[hl];B[hk]TR[hp][jp][kp][hq][lq][kr]
[lr]C[H : any better response to W's H8? I thought about K8, but it might not stop W to connect with the upper group.

K8 is better.  It connects your marked group outward, plus keeps the left and white groups separate.  Don't let your groups get surrounded (yes, this is a repetitive theme).]
;W[jl];B[hm];W[io]
(;B[jo]C[See variation];W[do];B[co];W[dq];B[ep];W[eq];B[cq]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[fr];B[eo];W[hr]C[Here is the problem with getting surrounded.  White gets move after move in sente, even if you manage to live.]
;B[gl];W[il];B[im];W[fm];B[em];W[fl];B[gm];W[fn];B[fk];W[el]
;B[dm]C[very nice job of getting both groups connected out.]
;W[lm];B[qi];W[jf];B[mj];W[kk];B[kj];W[lj];B[lk];W[li];B[kl]
C[H : W tried to avoid B's connection, but i'm quite happy with this move.

It really is excellent.];W[km];B[jk];W[jm];B[nk];W[ml];B[mk]
;W[ll];B[kk];W[po];B[qo];W[no];B[lo];W[qp]
(;B[rp]LB[rp:A][qq:B]C[H : I wondered if R3 would be ok, but I played it safe. I'm still not sure

Well, I think B works, but there is certainly room for complication and error.  Look at the variations.]
;W[qq];B[rq];W[qr];B[in]C[H : I think it could have been bad for B's lower group if I didn't connect here (I was not sure if this group would be alive alone, but as I review my game now it looks ok; again I played safe here).

I think this was necessary.];W[pf];B[pe];W[me];B[md];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[rd]C[Excellent!];W[qd];B[qe];W[rc];B[ra]
;W[le];B[ld];W[hb];B[ib];W[cc];B[cd];W[eb];B[dc];W[cb];B[db]
;W[bd];B[be];W[ab];B[ad]C[H : if B D19, W A16 then B19 or C19 and W gets two eyes.

Right.  Good.  (A 26 kyu would have no clue of these things).]
;W[da]C[H : I had this conenction in mind and planned to cut later at F18 and G19 (as done in the game).]
;B[fb];W[bc];B[ba];W[fa];B[ga];W[gb]C[H : unfortunately i hadn't thought of this. But it was a good practice of ko fight..]
;B[ea];W[oc];B[nc];W[fa];B[fo];W[ha]C[H : I lost the ko fight and the corner but i got plenty of territory on the left with next move. I think I lost a few points here, but this was an ok exchange for me (as I had the advantage of the handicap anyway)]
;B[gn];W[oa];B[nb];W[ia];B[ec];W[ea];B[ee]C[H: to insure life of the group

You are right.];W[bg];B[ff];W[gf];B[ka];W[jb]

Yes, it looks like it does.];W[ja];B[eh];W[eg];B[dh];W[bi];B[bj]

No, not with the white group in the corner dead.]))
