AB[pd][dp]C[I'm Eric Osman and I was white in this game. I have put in some questions. Some of my questions are about b because I wanted to comment the game for my opponent. However, I'd like to hear about both sides and what would have been better play.

By the way, I'm 4k on kgs where this game was played but I'm 2k on igs where this game wasn't played.

QianJiang:
I feel honored to review your game, I think this game is carefully
played. Very sorry I am not sure about certain questions, but at the
same time, there are some obvious mistakes which you may didn't notice.
And,
in my opinion, no one knows all the correct moves for a Go game, not to
say me a 4d, so what I can do is try to understand more about a game
and try to tell others about what I find out.
English is not my
native language and I know only some simple go terms in English, so
sometimes I have to choose a simple way such as "good moves" "bad
moves" etc in my comments. If there are some grammer errors in my
comments, just smile and tell me.
Ok, let me try.];W[pp];B[dd];W[cf];B[fd];W[ck];B[cn];W[nc];B[jc]

(;B[cc]LB[di:A]C[Should b jump to E12 instead of C17 ?  Or are they both good choices ?

QianJiang: I am not very sure.
Perhaps E12 better, because we know w will attack at A, As b, why let w attack us so early?]

(;W[ce];B[ei];W[dj]
(;B[fi]C[QianJiang: F11 not good.  It's right to strengthen this b group, but F11 is not the point.
W have sente at D12 or C13, so we can think these 2 places are white stones.
wD12,C13,E12...is
one hiden attack for black, in which white cut Black into 2 parts. w
cannot play it right now, but if black have to consider this in later
games, or have to place another stone here to make up for it, then F11
become low efficiency.
w F13 is good, too.];W[fg]C[QianJiang: This move show us F11 is not good.]
;B[eh]LB[gh:A][gi:B][hi:C][fk:D][gj:E][qb:F]MA[fi]C[QianJiang: Now we can see B in a bad shape.

If we remove X now and ask b to put a stone on board, where will he go? A?B?C?D?E?F? No one knows.
But I am sure it's not X.];W[he];B[hd]MA[id];W[fk];B[hi];W[bc]
;B[cb];W[je];B[kd];W[en];B[fq]LB[eq:A][dq:B][er:C][dr:D]C[is this B f3 more important than R18 at top ?

QianJiang: No, R18 better.
R18 attack w group, strengthen b group, sente, get territory at no cost.
F3 is not a good attack on left side w group, just strengthen b corner at a gote.
So, I think the answer is clear.
And, if b want to secure his A1 corner, E3,D2,D3 etc do better than F3.]
;W[bp]
(;B[cq]C[is C4 better than C3 for b ?

b should cut B4 from the left side w group, attack them.

;B[br];W[bn]LB[dn:A][dl:B][ji:C][qb:D][bm:B]C[QianJiang:b

[ck][bm][bn][co][cp][bp][bq]TR[ch][dg][eg][eh][ei][fi][hi]C[QianJiang: w connect with sente, all x stones become a living group.
all triangle stones have no eye, they are good target for w now.
C7 stone not very useful.
b lose lots here.];W[gj];B[gi];W[lf];B[me]LB[ji:A]C[is this N15 better than R18 ?

QianJiang: not sure, both important.
In fact, the most important thing is the center b group, I think it's  in danger now.]

LB[ji:A][ij:B]C[should B play here ?  or should b do something about his center stones ?

QianJiang:b shouldn't play here.  w upper group is live, this move cannot attack them.
M16 do not attack center w group, too.  do not strengthen any weak black groups. 2 b groups both strong.
do not make any territory.....etc....
I think M16 has little value.

B should help his center group.];W[li];B[bk];W[bj];B[dl];W[ek]
;B[bl];W[cl];B[dk];W[cj];B[ej];W[el]C[QianJiang:E8 is ok.

E7 is another choice.];B[dm]LB[ik:A]C[QianJiang: I will go A next move.]

[nk:C][pk:D][qn:E]C[is b too optomistic here ?  what should be do instead ?

QianJiang:I do not know what b optomistic means?
b B2 group is live, so b can attack.
you cannot kill J5 right?

b
can consider H3, M7, O9, Q9, R6, etc... instead.  Half of right T-T
side is empty, go there. And center b group need strengthen, that's it.]

(;B[fo]LB[kn:A][jo:B]C[QianJiang: feel safe when connect right? but next move, w k5 connect and safe, too.

so b can consider A, B. b B2 group is safe, so b will not in danger here, don't let w connect easily.

Cannot understand? en... Maybe this is for d*:)

remember, always try to get as more benefits as possible before you connect like this F5.]
;W[jo];B[gl];W[gk]LB[np:A]TR[hj][gj][fk][ek][el]MA[fn][en]C[QianJiang:I think H8 better shape, or H9.   Now H8 is b sente.

How big A is!];B[im];W[gn];B[gm];W[il]LB[kl:A]C[QianJiang: H9 is not an eye, so why not K8?
suppose
b L8, K8, we will find w shape so bad.];B[lm]C[QianJiang: From G8 to
now, w made no eyes here, and get a gote, leave bad shapes and few
liberties behind.
