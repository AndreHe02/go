C[Commentary by Eitan Aharoni  3-dan, Israel];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd]
;W[cp];B[jd];W[ip];B[dj]LB[pj:a]C['a' is better since on the left side W's position is low.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nd];W[rd];B[mf]LB[qc:a][nb:b]C[big point, but hasty. W takes the corner in sente (if B ignores 'a', W has 'b' later) and settles his group, then attacks the pincer stone.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qj];B[oh]LB[ng:a]C[bad to : 1. give the oponent a perfect target to attack, forcing you to attach to r10 and make it stronger. while you save a group with no points, he builds territory.
2. from shape considerations, W 'a' is terrible - like not answering a peep.]
;W[ng];B[pj];W[pk];B[oj];W[qi];B[qg]LB[og:a]C[good if you intend to follow-up with 'a' so as to connect in sente.]
;W[pi]C[just helps B, since W can't cut.];B[oi];W[pf];B[ph]
LB[og:a][nf:b]C[now the r13 stone makes bad shape. if you didn't intend to make the 'a'-'b' exchange ( although it weakens n14), you should just play q12 immediately.]
;W[ql];B[re]C[a probe, but if W answers correctly he is safe, see variation.]

(;W[qe]LB[rf:a]C[wrong answer. B 'a' is now sente and improves B's eyeshape, so he should play it immediately. r15 is almost equivalent to passing.]
;B[li];W[mg]LB[rf:a]C[W is going to play 'a' anyway, so pushing first just helps B.

B missed a chance here, if he played 'a' he could chase W along the board making territory in the process.]
;B[lf];W[rf];B[nq]LB[kj:a][pq:b]C[consider 'a' . it both prevents W from cutting (W's threat to cut will cause you a lot of trouble later) and makes the center your moyo. just looks great, doesn't it ?

As for W, see variation for sugested answer other than 'b'.

It is here that W first establishes a lead.]
(;W[pq];B[kq];W[jq];B[kp];W[fq];B[no]LB[kj:a]C['a' would still be better.]
;W[on];B[nn];W[fc]C[good point to invade.];B[ec];W[cf]LB[fd:a]
C[wrong, B 'a' now would make the whole top his territory.]
;B[ce]C[did you just mean to make W heavy, or were you concerned about the corner ?
anyway, playing so tight and confined is not advisable. when W wraps around the corner in the following sequence, he is safe from attack.]
;W[eb];B[db];W[ed];B[dc];W[ee];B[de];W[gd]C[good. W erased the main area where B could have territory. B's hane next is good, but W leads.]
;B[ef];W[ff];B[fg];W[gf];B[gg];W[ic];B[jc];W[ib];B[jb]LB[cm:a]
[cn:b][cq:c]C[much too small for now - 'a' or 'b' are bigger ('a' safer in territory, 'b' aims at 'c')]
;W[cl]LB[dl:a]C['a' would be a lot better. B is given an opportunity to go for something big in the center.]
;B[hf];W[ge];B[id];W[hc];B[fb];W[gb];B[el];W[bj];B[en];W[cn]
;B[in]LB[mi:a][mj:b][lh:c][jo:d]C[With the help of W's low moves on the left, B has a chance now if he can get 25-30 pts in the center.

if W plays the 'a'-'b'-'c' sequence, then takes 'd', he will win.

See variation.]

;W[ni];B[nk];W[mk];B[nl];W[lj];B[kj];W[kk];B[jk];W[eg];B[df]
;W[eh]LB[hg:a]C[this only makes things worse for W - 'a' doesn't work at the moment.]
;B[kl];W[lk];B[ci];W[fm]C[good. B must connect. game will be decided here.]
;B[em];W[gn]LB[gk:a]C[B should be able to penetrate the bottom while threatening W's connection. if he does so and then also gets 'a', he wins. if he just gets 'a' and W defends the bottom, game very close.

see variation.]
(;B[fp]LB[fo:a]C[complicated, simply 'a' then continuing down does the job.]
;W[gp];B[ep]LB[eq:a]C[B should have played 'a'.];W[eq]C[W defended the bottom and now has the advantage.

The rest has little to comment , W has a secure lead.

B showed the right spirit when going for the center territory. just a little more reading, and good counting habits will get you far :)

Good luck,
