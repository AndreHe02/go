;W[db]C[Now white settles himself well, which eases the game for him by a big deal.]
;B[cb];W[eb]LB[gb:C][ed:B][df:A]C[There are two posible strategies. One is to connect @ B, making a good shape in sente, the other is to keep the attack by C.]
(;B[df]TR[ed]C[Problem with this move is that you will have to answer W E16 later and with D14 in place you will make a bad shape.]
;W[fg];B[dh];W[jg]LB[lc:A][le:C][me:D][kg:B]C[Usual strategy in high handicap. The main course is to scare the oponent, so that he tryes to live at the (top) side, while W makes a lot of outer strength, which is what he needs to win.

There are many playable moves, like B-D. The important thing is to keep white separated and move to the middle.]
;B[lc]C[Brakeshoe- I tought i could kill that stone and therefore make life at least if i cant then run out.

You do exactly what W wants. You should never try to live like this.]
(;W[le];B[kf]C[no choice now];W[lh]C[White wants to direct you towards the corner so that he can rape it once you get close.]

;B[ge]C[This is 100% gote. You are either connected or alive without it.]
;W[ph]LB[ob:A][og:B]C[Brakeshoe- Right there I was quite happy with my overall result. I had white drifting in the center, connected my crap and made a life on top, plus I have some aji left . Now this was a good move cause I have to defend a weakness at P18, perhaps a keima at R14 would have been a wiser play. Is it better to play a keima when u have more than 6 stones handicap ?

First part is wrong - W gained a corner and what you call drifting stones, well those indeed are drifting stones, but in a 9hcp these are actually central thickness, as he can use them for attacking better than you can attack them.

Q14 shape is better in high handicapes as it is more active and allowes much better attacks on white. But of course you need to know how to answer moves like Q12.]
(;B[ob]C[This move is ok, but passive];W[qe]LB[qc:A][qd:B][pe:C]
C[Almost all is better than your response.]
(;B[qc];W[pe];B[od];W[oe];B[rd];W[re];B[nh]C[Brakeshoe- Empty move? I played it because it could serve many purposes depending on w's answer.

There is a proverb - never peep a possible cut. You force white to connect at N13, which is was main worry until now.]
;W[oi]C[W should happily connect at N13 instead];B[kh]C[This looks like a very good counter-attack]

(;B[hj]C[Brakeshoe- Didn't want to play the var. I was dead then.]
;W[gj];B[ij];W[fi]C[Brakeshoe- So now he has to make a second eye, and I couldnt fight properly. Is it a situation where you have to kill because of my weak group in center or can I still make more profit by playing around him?

There isn't very much you can do now. But he is not alive yet, so just take it easy, jump out with the center and see later.]
;B[im];W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[nq]TR[np]C[Now you want to play higher even more, to be closer to the still weak center.]
;W[no]LB[nk:C][pl:B][rl:A]C[This looks like an overplay

A is wrong (see comment in next move), B is best for attacking as it severes his base, C is a safe distatnt attack.]
;B[rl]TR[rj]C[Don't play on second line, unless it's an endgame.. Of course the proverb cannot be followed literaly, but this is the case. Are you afraind of the connection underneath, as he did at the top? Don't worry about that, as it would be him playing on second line, therefor playing weak.]
;W[rm]C[Exchange good for white];B[mk]C[looks possible, but needs a lot of reading.]
;W[nk];B[oo]TR[qo][pp]C[Brakeshoe- Bad shape. I find myself doing that shape quite often, is there a remedy?

Well, in some cases it's possible to play. In this case you are saying that you will take the bottom center in exchange for corner and right side. Which favours white.]
;W[on];B[nn];W[mo]LB[nm:B][lp:A]C[Hmm, I would just take the right side, this looks unreasonably aggresive.

You have no choice but to fight at B.];B[lp]C[This way you leave white with the right side and get nothing for yourself.]

;W[po];B[rp];W[pq];B[qq]C[Was this your plan when you played S4?? Why did you play it then?

I would have loved to have my center alive but i had a lined 3 eyeshape so. As tiesto said I shouldn't have ignored, but I often ignore threats in handicap games because I can't evaluate them. Maybe it died even if I answered it and that way I might have lost the corner and the center.

Not to die everywhere is not enough to win a game, white did very well.
The main problems were the start, when you got cheated in a classical way at the top, defending instead of attacking. Then you missed the oportunity to take first the right side, then the middle and when you started the ko at bottom right, it was already bad. When you lost the middle, the game was over.
Try to look at some high handicap games of very strong players, even pro's play it sometimes. You would see the proper josekis at the sides.]
