C[Abe:  Hello!

I played black in this game.  A large part of this game involved attacking a white group across the board.  My hope wasn't to kill the group, but to get useful profit around the board from the chase.

Unfortunately, it didn't work out as I had hoped.

Some mistakes are tactical - I'd love some clear-headed perspective on fighting - where my maneuvers are weak.

But I'd especially appreciate comments on overall strategic flow and timing, attack and defense.

Thanks in advance!


Jon:  Hi!  I'm Jon, your reviewer.  I added my thoughts regarding each of these topics where they arose in the game.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[qk];B[qn];W[qg]LB[qi:A]C[Jon:  White extended a little further than usual, which I'm not totally comfortable with.  I don't think it's worth pushing that extra distance and leaving an easier invasion for black later (A).]
;B[fq];W[hq]
(;B[dq]C[Jon:  This attachment isn't really appropriate in this position.  It's generally a way to settle if you're under pressure and don't mind taking a small base, but that's not what's going on here.  Can you find a better plan for black?]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[dr]LB[er:A]C[Jon:  Connecting directly doesn't help you build eye shape as well as the indirect connection (A) does, so I'd rather play that instead.]
;W[kq]LB[ep:A]C[Jon:  From white's perspective, I really don't want to let black get the hane at A, so I'd prefer to get it first and maintain the pressure on the group.]
;B[ck]LB[ep:A]C[Jon:  Similarly, from black's perspective, I want to get the hane at A too, to settle the corner.  I'm a tad concerned about trying to start something nearby when the bottom left corner isn't setlled.]
(;W[fp]LB[ep:A]C[Jon:  White's leaving himself quite thin.  I suspect he's afraid of black playing here himself if he plays at A instead, but it's nothing to be worried about.]
;B[gp];W[eq]TR[fp]C[Jon:  Naturally, white's now in an awkward position from trying to play around the issues created by the marked move.]
;B[er];W[ep];B[gq]C[Jon:  You can be pretty happy with the result.  White's bottom left group is somewhat awkwardly positioned, and he's damaged his bottom group in the process.]
;W[ch];B[cn];W[em]LB[go:A]TR[gp]C[Jon:  I'd like to hane first (A) and keep black's marked stone pressed down.  It keeps black from expanding straight up and also provides a greater range of movement for the escaping group (i.e. gives it more room to move around).]
;B[gn];W[dl]LB[fl:A]C[Jon:  Trying to press here feels somewhat blunt.  I'd rather kosumi on the other side (A), as it gets the group out faster and keeps white's options open for attacking the left side group later.]
;B[cl];W[nq];B[en]LB[ej:A]C[Jon:  Your position isn't strong enough to try attacking the connectivity of white's stones yet, especially with your left side group at risk of getting counterattacked.  I'd really prefer to move the left side group out and restrict white's escape route from the outside by playing A.  This decision ends up being a critical factor in the overall fight.]
;W[dn];B[do]
(;W[eo]C[Jon:  Making the atari from the other side (A) would provide a better result for white.]
;B[dm];W[fn];B[fm];W[dn];B[cm];W[en];B[fl];W[el];B[ej];W[fk]
C[Jon:  Black's predicament becomes clear here - it's very hard to manage both the left side group and your outside wall.]
;B[hm];W[ek];B[dj];W[hl];B[il];W[gm]LB[gk:A]TR[hl]C[Jon:  This is a bit of bad form.  Playing at A instead will provide the same benefit without putting the marked stone into atari.]
;B[gl];W[hk];B[gk]LB[gi:A]C[Jon:  Trying to push through should definitely be avoided.  It forces white out further and damages your left side group in the process, so I'd prefer to keima out (A) and aggressively try to get the left side group out of danger.]
;W[gj];B[gm];W[im];B[hj];W[fj];B[ik]LB[eh:A]C[Jon:  I don't think you can afford to capture, considering that white will shut off your left side group's escape route.  I'd rather jump out with A and make sure that doesn't happen.]
;W[ei];B[di];W[dh];B[eh];W[fi];B[eg];W[df];B[gg];W[hi];B[ii]
;W[hh];B[gh];W[gi];B[if];W[ih];B[jh];W[ji];B[ij];W[jg];B[kh]

[bk:A]C[Jon:  I'm not sure if white missed it or he didn't want to risk the complications, but he can kill black's left side group by extending to A.  It does mean conceding some of the top left corner due to the trouble black can cause with B, but I feel it's worth it.]
;B[bk];W[ai];B[bo];W[bp]
(;B[bm]C[Abe:  Is A7 better?

Jon:  It's not, as it doesn't work.];W[al];B[ak];W[an];B[ao]
;W[am];B[co];W[jf]C[Jon:  I don't think this exchange is good.  If white wants to extend from the top left corner, he can do so while threatening the cut.  Pushing here also helps black strengthen his top right area, which will be reasonably large in terms of size.  White will want to avoid doing this to keep the area as open as possible for a future attack.]
;B[je];W[ie];B[id];W[gd]LB[fc:A]C[Jon:  White must also consider a slower third line extension (e.g. A), as he has to respect the threat of black invading the corner.]
;B[he];W[lh];B[ki];W[li];B[kj];W[lg]C[Jon:  White's in the clear now, but the overall result is interesting.  Even with the struggle to defend your left side group, the attack didn't turn out all that badly.  White had to spend a lot of time and resources to defend, which translates to a major loss in productivity.  He doesn't have much in potential territory beyond the top left corner, while you have a relatively significant portion with the top right area.  You can also use your strong center position to facilitate digging out the base of white's bottom group.]
;B[db]C[Abe:  I felt that there was enough room here to reduce white.  But is this an okay time to attack? Is this an okay starting stone?

Jon:  It's a reasonable timing and place to probe.  The corner is currently one of white's largest areas of territory, so trimming it down will be valuble.]
;W[fb];B[cd];W[ce];B[cc];W[bb]LB[ib:B][ec:A][me:C]C[Jon:  Trying to kill the corner is unnecessary.  If white defends the outside with A, he'll ensure he can poke into black's top right area more easily by opening up the possibility of white B, in addition to C.  Black will still have to settle the corner too, giving white time to start working on something else.]

;B[ca]LB[da:A]C[Abe:  I believe that if I had played D19 here, I would have won this fight

Jon:  Yeah, if you D-19, the big eye in the corner allows you plenty of time to win the capturing race and establish a pretty favorable position overall.]

;W[mk];B[ll];W[nj];B[qi]C[Abe:  From here on in, I feel that I badly lost my concentration and perspective.  I was shaken by the top left.

Jon:  That's understandable, so I didn't add any comments after this.  Thanks for reading!]
