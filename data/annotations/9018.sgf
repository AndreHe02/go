i think you give your self a much better chance of killing the w middle group if you play away from it. It's possible to sacrifice stones. just think about which wons are valuable..i.e do they allow/prevent connections, or eyes. It's difficult too rely on reading out, but all go players work on they're reading (it's bread a butter go play). In those cases where reading is too difficult i think most players will rely on feel and few general rules....One of which is "don't play attach/play too close to weak groups"]

try and remember to stop before each more. sometimes it's too easy to play locally to where you're opponent has played. Good players always think..."what's the biggest (worth the most points) move on the board"

I hope you get something from the review, even though it's not concise ! :0)

don't be afraid to play cuts, even if you're not sure. the trick is to know when to give them up, if it seems they're not working. There are many different strategies to play with a cut or throw in. often you don't actually save them, but gain more territory on the other side.]

There are many nuances to it in more advanced games, but one of the the wys i like to think about it is in terms of a force "your wall exerts influence".  You create many big walls during this ga,e, but don't use them in the best way.

Here I thought black can play either A or B. The idea is not to try and kill white, but to push them in a way that lets you build potential territory, a framework.

With A black tries to push W and make a possible territory with the was creted around the corner.

With B , w is pushe against the wall at the bottom and tries to expand territory from the two stoness on the left.]
