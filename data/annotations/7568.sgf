C[s: Hello Jeff.  My name is Sam Tregar and I'll be reviewing your game.  I play at around 4-kyu on KGS, so please be aware that I'm not an expert.  If you have questions about my review please feel free to ask or find a higher level player to have a look.]
FG[259:]PM[2];B[pc];W[dd]C[here I hesitate between D16 and Q4. I choose D16 because it is in front of the enclosure Black could later make, with Q15 or R15.

s: I think either is fine.  You might choose Q4 if you wanted to stop black from making the chinese opening but otherwise I don't have any reason to recommend one or the other.  A more neutral opening around D4 is more common.]
;B[fc];W[df];B[ch];W[cg];B[ck]LB[dh:A]C[s: Odd response - the usual move would be A, following the saying "attach, extend."  Playing this way leaves a weakness you can exploit later.]
;W[pp]TR[ck]C[Here I play Q8 because it looks safer than D4.

s: D4 is also perfectly safe - Black's marked stone is much too far from the corner to be a threat.  I think this move is fine though.]
;B[qo];W[qp];B[nq];W[oo]LB[no:B][po:a][oq:A]C[Here maybe A would have been better.

s: I think this is ok.  I might have prefered A myself, or if I was going to jump out maybe B.  The move you suggest feels too cramped to me.]
;B[pm];W[cq]LB[cp:A][dp:B][dq:C]C[Here I chose san-san for security.

... but now I think a play at D4 (even followed by an invasion) would have been OK too.

s: You worry too much about black's stone - it's 5 stones away from the corner, no threat at all.  I think A, B or C would all be better than this move.]
;B[co];W[fq];B[hq];W[dp]LB[fo:A][kq:B]C[s: This feels small - I think A would be better.  Black is trying to setup two groups here and they're both fairly weak.  If you cut between them you can attack one and have a good chance of success.  B is also tempting - black would have to choose which side to give up and you'd be sure to profit.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[kq];W[mo]C[escape...];B[nm];W[oq]LB[kc:A][ph:B]
C[trying to protect my corner / base

s: Not a terrible move locally, but it's too soon to be playing this kind of tight territorial move.  Instead you should be doing what Janice Kim recommends - "rush to plant your flag."  That means you want to be the first one to play in a big open area - prime candidates here are around A and B.]
;B[pj];W[pe]C[a: Good move];B[qg];W[of]LB[qc:A]C[s: I don't like this as much, I think a corner invasion now would be profitable - maybe start at A.]
;B[oh]C[s: Slow move from black - I don't think he needs to defend here.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nd];B[mc];W[le];B[kd];W[mg];B[mh];W[lg];B[lh]
;W[kg];B[ji]LB[pe:A]C[Here with the sequence from 26 to 40, I try to make some decent shape, but this allows Black to get a huge influence in the center, plus territory in the North...

Maybe instead of my initial approach at 26, I should have played a pincer at H17 or H16, or a splitting move at L17 ?

s: Both decent ideas.  I think could also have been more aggresive after play A instead of letting black boss you around and take territory.  Your stones have been safe enough for several moves if you consider that you should be able to make at least one eye on the right side.]
;W[hc]C[s: Good - black left his stone weak in the opening.]

C[s: This feels slow to me - you don't need to connect this two groups and this doesn't threaten black.

s: I'd say you're well into the middle game so now is a good time to pause and see how you're doing.  I've marked out what I think are each side's likely territories - not an exact science of course.  You've got 34 + 7 + 12 + 11 + 1= 65.  Black has 17 + 19 + 36 + 10 = 82.  So Black appears to be ahead at this point.  A lot depends on what happens in the upper right and of course the battle for the center.]
;B[km]C[s: Good move from black, staking out a big territory on the right side.]
;W[ko]C[s: Good move, this will help you attack the bottom.]
;B[eh];W[fg];B[gi];W[en]LB[em:A]C[s: Nice - this is a big point, causing problems for black on the side and in the middle.  A would also have been good.]
;B[dn]C[s: Terrible move from back - this is the dreaded "empty triangle" move which is almost never correct and certainly isn't here.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[ek]LB[jk:b][lk:c][hn:a]C[here I could not decide between 66 or somewhere in the B-C area.

s: I think this is ok - B or C seem too deep to me and likely to be captured.  A is playable but maybe a bit vague.  I think bigger than any of these would be a play on the left side, maybe B12 or in the upper right corner.]
;B[gl];W[fl];B[im];W[gm];B[gk];W[dj];B[cj];W[di];B[qe]C[s: This is a big move, potentially securing the corner for black.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[re];B[pd];W[qf];B[rg];W[ro]LB[bh:A]C[s: Excellent move - moves like this along the side that both expand your territory and threaten your opponent's are very often big in the middle game.  Try to play these instead of vague moves in the middle of the board.  There's another big one like this at A!]
;B[qn];W[rn];B[rm];W[nk]LB[bh:C][hh:D][lr:B][nr:A]C[here my idea would be to parachute a stone in the middle to provide support to a cut, somewhere, later...

s: Seems hopeless to me...  Better would be A, B, C, or even D]

;B[bc];W[bd];B[db];W[eb];B[ac]
(;W[ad];B[da];W[dc]LB[ba:a]C[here i think 98 was a mistake and A would have killed, or at least koed.

s: Seems possible, but go back a couple moves and I've played out a kill I think.]
;B[bb];W[ba];B[ca];W[ih]C[s: Good move - makes territory for you and black has to answer.]
;B[ii];W[hh];B[hi];W[gh];B[fi];W[eg];B[or]LB[ro:A]C[s: Good move for black - this is just like your move at A, but black got here first!]

;W[af];B[aj];W[ai];B[bj];W[dh]LB[nc:D][rc:A][bp:B][gr:C]C[s: Terrible move!  It's worth only a point or two - meanwhile big moves around A, B, C, etc are all available!  Even a small move like D is at least sente!]

214 and 216 are played for the only sake of making things complex and hide my target.

C[s: I think you did quite well in the later part of the game - by my count you were behind by around 15 points after the opening, so coming back to lose by only 1.5 points is really pretty good.  You played the majority of the best endgame points and you ended up grabbing a healthy middle territory to balance black's.  If you had killed black's invasion in the upper left corner you would have won for sure.

s: I think you would benefit most from reading a book about the opening.  You had a hard game here mostly because you didn't setup a good opening position for yourself.  Your fighting skills seem good and you have a good grasp of endgame strategy.  Improve your opening and your rank will go up fast!  Aside from that just keep playing as often as you can and good luck!]
