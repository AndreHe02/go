C[Hello, My name is Jaco and I'm from South Africa. I hope you can learn from my comments.

Hi. A game played on KGS. I (black) have written some comments & questions in the file. But any comments you can think of are also very welcome. We both are quite new to Go, having played for around 5 weeks total. Thank you for taking the time to comment on this game.]
;B[pq];W[dp];B[pc]C[I usually don't open like this, and when i did the first thing that hit me after placing the stone was that i was just inviting white to attack the middle right side.]
;W[dd]C[In this situation black has at least 2 options.
He can... ( see the 2 variations )]
(;B[fq]C[I had been reading up on 4-4 josekis so i decided to practise.]

(;W[eq]
(;B[ep]LB[fp:A]C[I probobly should have played A? How should white have punished me for the move i played?

The cut is pretty severe, see the variations.]
(;W[eo];B[fp];W[er];B[fr];W[fs]C[Black should cut at A.]
(;B[gs];W[es];B[hr]C[I perhaps should have closed for 1 ko threat less? But i felt perhaps a false sence of security of having at least 1 more stone towards the low middle side.]
;W[cc]C[During the next 3 moves i was thinking if i could invade and take the 4 connected stones at the bottom.]
;B[pi];W[fl];B[kd];W[fh];B[dq]C[Finally decided to invade after being quite sure it was safe. Any comments on how i should have played this if not the way i did would be very welcome. (Except for not thinking about it for 3 moves:) )]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[do];B[br];W[co]LB[gn:A]C[Black can tenuki( play somewhere else). For instance A, see variation.]

(;B[bp];W[bo];B[ao]C[I guess this move was just asking for trouble.]
;W[an];B[ap]C[After this one i was banging my head in the wall for being so stupid.]
;W[aq];B[bq];W[bs];B[hm]LB[gn:A]C[This move is wrong. It would have been better at A. 

Since white was moving to the middle i felt i'd also need to if i wouldnt want to loose the whole middle. Should i have played at the top instead or strenghtened my position somewhere elsewhere? (Like the lower middle side?)]
;W[gn];B[hn];W[fo];B[ho];W[hk];B[fc];W[fe];B[ge];W[gf];B[gd]
;W[fd];B[fb];W[ec];B[eb];W[db]TR[gc]C[I wasnt very conserned of the cutting point becouse of the two liberties at E19 and F19. White didnt attack here. But should i have protected the point?

See the variation.];B[go]LB[hf:A]C[I guess this was a bit too small? But i was guessing/hoping that white would respond anyway.

yes this move is too small. Better 2 play at A.]
(;W[gm];B[qn]C[Is this being too cautious?];W[kl]C[White starts to move into the middle and moving towards my territory. Any comments on the next 20 moves are also very welcome.]

[fr][gs]C[I felt that i had lost so many points in the lower corner that i needed to invade. I think its the first time i seriously try a invasion like this. It worked well untill i screwed it up. So comments on a this kind of invasion would be very welcome.

In fact you are ahead in points! Black's shape is open where white's shape is closed up on its self. Black should defend at A. And if .... see variation...]

Would A have been playable instead?

Better play A. It creates eye space for the black group.];W[ch]

;B[lg];W[kg];B[lj];W[kk];B[lh]C[The idea here was that white hopefully hadnt notice the big threat and wouldnt separe my 2 stones, rather connect some of the 2 ataris. If white had isolated the 2 black stones i would have been happy with just moving in his territory with help of the ataris.]
;W[kh];B[mh]C[I was happy with what i had gotten and didnt want to take risks. But i guess i could have played this in L11 aswell?]
;W[kj];B[nb]LB[lq:A]C[I hope my comments helped. Remember play a lot of games and you will improve.

I guess this could have been played on L11 or O9? I wanted to be safe after the disasters at the lower left corner and left middle side. White resigns here.

what if white would have invaded at A? I was thinking of placing a stone there in defence but never "had the time". How should i have defended if white attacked at A?

Any overall comments? Any comments on what i specially should study to get stronger? Thank you once again for taking the time to comment on this game.]
