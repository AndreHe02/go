Hi E.R.Marin, I believe you need to be a bit more ambitious, look always for the bigger free area in the board and play there.  
Do not play where your opponent played.  Look the whole board and look for the best place to go.]

(;W[dj]C[I don't like this shape.  When you play (3,4) is to enclose the corner.  I clearly prefer the alternatives enclosing one corner.]
;B[cg]C[Even though is a black move, I believe i t deserves a comment.
Why is this move bad?  
* It has not sense to invade when there is still a lot of free space.
* It is attacking your stone from its stronger side.  To invade, C5 would be a better option.]
(;W[cm]C[Black dared to enter your house.  You must not fear him, you have to hit him.  D10 it is not in risk yet, and if black crawls under it, it will be good for you.]

* Never play second line in the first moves.

Now you can really see why black invasion in the early game has been a mistake.  You played well and made influence and points while he made almost nothing.]
