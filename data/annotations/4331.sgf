RE[W+11.50]
TM[900]

C[Ben: Conventional wisdom is that you should not get hung up on your rank, and I'm inclined to agree. But then I've never taken a significant step back like you have, so it's not particularly fair for me to say that.

Also, KGS is a bit funny about rank. Ranks there are volatile, as most rank graphs will show. Perhaps there was some correction to everyone's ranks. Or perhaps it was only a fluke that you were a 3 kyu for so long.

One of the people at my go club is 11 kyu on KGS. I'm 1 kyu on IGS. And we play with a two stone handicap (actually, we play even, but I'm trying to convince him to play with me at two stones).

But that's enough talking. I don't believe you can really lose four stones in strength - I think whatever happened was probably outside you (although to be sure I'd have to go through your old games and your new games). So just keep playing, keep trying to improve, or whatever it is you like to do when you play go.

[Reading this later, I think of something else...\]

It could be psychological. I'm not saying it is, but it could be. You have to have confidence in yourself. If you don't, you will find yourself playing conservatively out of fear and then later in the same game making massive overplays trying to catch up. This is a situation I have been in, although not to the point of losing four stones strength.

But even if this is the case, remember that it's not that you've forgotten anything. You just need to get a sense of balance back into your game, and then perhaps you'll emerge even stronger than before.

But remember, I'm not saying this is why your rank on KGS has changed so significantly.]

;B[nc];W[pj]C[Ben: White is letting you have three corners. I would advise against this.]
;B[dp];W[ec];B[de];W[hc]
(;B[kc]C[This is one typical situation that puzzles me. There are two places I want to play badly, one is somewhere around D11, the other is around L17. If I play one, white will play the other and get me in a tight situation. It's like a no-win situation: Either way I'm going to struggle with one of the groups. Looking at it afterwards I would now play around D11 instead of L17.  After all, making a strong moyo on the left side and making life in the upper right corner doesn't feel as bad as making a much smaller moyo on the upper side and having to run from the left side. This is one thing that causes me problems: I end up in situations where I have to choose between two evils. Is this inevitable? I often fail to estimate which one of them is the lesser one, as probably in this case.


Ben:
When you're forced to choose between two opotions you don't like, it means you've played badly, or it means you're looking at it in the wrong way. Here, you feel that the two stones in the upper right are weak, as are the two on the left. Well, I'd disagree. I'd say neither is really weak, so it's more a case of choosing the better of two goods - attack White at the top with something like L17, or make a moyo with something like C10.

But L17 is not a serious attack on White, because White still has two ways to stabalise himself. He can run into the center, or he can push into the corner with C18. If, on the other hand, the two White stones had been one line further to the right, and D15 was at D17, I'd say l17 would be a very good move. (I included a variation here for the sake of visualisation).

And if you play on the left side, and White tries to attack on the other side, you can either take the corner with S16 or extend along the top with L17 (and start to put pressure on the White stones at the top).

So essentially I'm saying that L17 is an error in direction, and instead you should play on the left. But as to which point to play, I can't say. My best guess would be c10, because it seems to work well with the stones on both sides, and I don't think you need to play too close to the C16/D15 stones because they still have D17 as an option to take the corner.]
;W[dh]C[Ben: I don't know what this move is trying to do. It certainly isn't going to put much pressure on the two stones in the top left. Black can just play D17, taking the corner and attacking the stones at the top. And White D12 doesn't have any great ways to make territory.]
;B[fe]C[Ben: I'd have played D17. After Black F15, White can play C18 (perhaps not quite yet), and the Black stones are sort of floating.]
;W[cb]C[Ben: White has the right idea. Now White D12 is being useful.]
;B[dc];W[db];B[ed];W[fc];B[dj]C[Ben: This is a fairly good counter attack by Black. The question is how to use the attack on D12 to make territory between D10 and D4.]
;W[fh];B[he]C[Ben: I don't think you need to worry about this Black group too much. It's not going to get much territory (because White will live on both sides), but nor does White yet have any good attack on it. I think F10 (build influence while attacking) or D8 (to take territory while putting pressure on the above White stones), would have been better.]
;W[ie]C[Ben: White's pushing you in the wrong direction here. Black will obviously respond in a way that puts more pressure on the weak white stones below. Instead, White should play something like F10, settling these stones in sente (because you'll want to play something like D8 to protect your stone), and then move elsewhere.]
;B[hf];W[id]
(;B[hh]C[Ben: Again, I think I'd play F10, because I wouldn't be worried about the Black group above. I've added a hypothetical variation.]
;W[ej]C[Ben: As I've said, I was thinking of F10 for White. This seems to make it a bit easy for Black to make himself strong.]
;B[dk];W[ek];B[dl]C[Here I thought: "4th line territory? Why not." Was I being too naive?

Ben: No. It's important sometimes not to try to be tricky. When you can get easy territory, or when you can easily make yourself strong, it's usually right to. This is basically what happened when White played C18.]
;W[di];B[jp]C[Ben: I think E8 would be bigger, probably because it would put pressure on the White group.]
;W[cq]
(;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn]
(;B[cm];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[gj]C[Ben: I can't say how Black could have attacked this group, but I do think that White needs to protect it.]
;B[op]C[Ben: This is a nice Black move, making a moyo on the bottom side. It seems to have balance, not letting White have too much on the right side without letting you get more in the corner.]
;W[mq]C[Ben: I don't know what to say about this move. It's the right idea, I suppose, invading the bottom side. But it's going to have a negative effect on the right. As it stands, the white stone at R5 is already starting to look like it could become a problem.]

(;B[qp]C[My knowledge of odd josekis is zero, so I had to improvise on the fly.

Ben: The single most important thing to know about joseki is that the stones on the rest of the board play a big part. When there are no stones closer than the other corners, you can play joseki. But when there are so many stones, and so much thickness, so close, the joseki are irrelevant. Here, you need to forget anything you know about joseki, and find a move that works locally and fits globally.

What that move is, however, is a really hard question. R4 seems okay to me, but let's see where it goes...

In the mean time, for what it's worth Q3 was my first thought.]
;W[pq];B[pp]C[Ben: P3 is definitely worth considering here. It may not be that great, but nor is Q4.]
;W[oq];B[qq];W[np]C[Ben: White's done too well. In hind-sight, I don't think R4 was too good. Q3 was a very good reply. And in terms of good shape, White O4 is about as good as it gets. A so called "bulge point".]

(;B[qm]C[Ben: Right idea. My first thought was q6. I'll include a variation to demonstrate where it might have gone.]
;W[no];B[on];W[rd];B[qc];W[qk];B[rl];W[hp]C[I have noticed that KGS 6-5 kyus have all the same feature: They are extremely jealous of opponent potential territory and will invade everything. Much to my exasperation in 95% of cases they succeed superbly. Clearly they know something I don't.

In this situation I was not even trying to make territory with that wall. After all, you should not make territory with a wall. Still he thinks I will and goes there to stop me. I thought I would do something else more useful. I just didn't know exactly what.

Ben: I guess you can't stop White, but you're right, you weren't going to get a lot of territory here because White is strong above and to the right.

Now, I suppose your first though must be to stop White capturing K4 on a large scale.]
;B[hq]C[Ben: This was my first thought.];W[iq];B[ip];W[jq];B[ho]
;W[hr];B[gp];W[kp]C[Ben: You've got sente, and it's starting to feel close to the end game. The way I see it, you should be trying to make sure you enter the end game with sente, so that you can take the big points. S10, for example is really big, and should be sente if played at the right time. S17 is also really big, and White will not want to ignore it (though might be able). All Black's groups are strong, so you should be able to keep sente.]

(;B[cg];W[gl]C[Ben: I din't like the C13/G8 exchange. Black had potential for some significant territory in this area.]

(;B[qn]C[Ben: I think T8 is fine. I've included a variation. (Even if you want to give up on T10, etc., I think you should play P7 first, because it achieves the same thing as R6, but gives you a better position).]

If Black played here, he would actually gain a point, because White would have to spend one move protecting R12, and two more capturing the new stone. So this is a one-point sente move for Black - obviously bigger than the ko. And how sweet would it have been if you'd played here as a ko threat?

But, while this is all very true, it's not very important. Black s12 would not have changed the outcome.]

Ben: Here are your mostsignificant mistakes, as I see it...

L17 at move 11, a slight error in direction that was bourne out by the pressure White ultimately put on the stones on the left.

F15 at move 13, letting White get a strong base and take away yours at the same time.

H12 at move 25, a slight error in direction that neither attacks severly nor is really needed for protection.

R4 at move 47, giving White a brilliant play at Q3.

Leaving Q1 for so long, and letting White have R1.

Not playing S12 at move 227.

There were other little mistakes, and other moves I can critisize but I can't offer better alternatives to. The things I mention above are the ones I think most warrant consideration.]
