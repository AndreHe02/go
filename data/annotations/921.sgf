C[Ashwolf: Hi,
This turned out to be a fairly "fight oriented" game, with no
large moyos or territories.  I find such games difficult because
I have trouble judging when to walk away from a situation.  In
some cases I play an extra stone in gote and miss big moves.
However in other cases I tenuki, only to find that my group is
under serious attack.  Some pointers on this would be helpful.


Hi ashwolf .. well I'll have a look and see what I can recommend.
Hope these comments are helpful. I think you need to keep an
eye on your groups and make sure you only have one weak group
at a time. Also look to attack when your opponents groups are
weak .. but attack to build territory or influence and only look
to kill if you are lucky!! Also dont be afraid of cutting your
opponent. You play with courage .. many attacking moves and some
were really good!!

Keep on learning

misguided idea that I could put pressure on the corner, which
is reflected in my next couple of moves.

my g9 stones and just push from the right?
  It gets so comlicated here to work out if you could capture h7
group .. It is very unlikely as you have two weak groups now
.. as a rule only have one weak group!!];B[jk];W[jl];B[kl];W[ik]

No I dont think so .. now that bl has saved his b6 group white
is in a lot of trouble .. two weak groups .. so j12 is an excellant
attacking move .. it attacks both groups];W[gg]
