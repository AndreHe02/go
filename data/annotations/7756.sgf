AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hello, Paco!

I am Bernd, 1k in Germany, HonFu in the GTL and on KGS.];W[fc]
C[P: Sometimes when I attack a group, my oponent scapes and I end having a weak group and being attacked. Also I dont get too much benefit from my attacks.

Hon: I still have the same problems (probably every other go player as well), just on another level. But let's see why your attacks misfired.

The main mistake is that you try to kill and forget to make points when they are there. A good attack does not go only for the capture, but for attacking in a way that points solidify for you on the other side. In this game you kept destroying your own potential territory by driving the enemy group in there.

Then, you touch the weak stones too much. That only helps the weak group, strengthen its shape. Also you often end up with weak spots in your own shape, or you take your own liberties. You should NOT touch a weak group voluntarily! In this game I will mark every move of this kind with a square, so you can try to understand and change this.

Finally, you die needlessly in some places. The only way to change that is to solve more problems, life and death and tesuji. You should make it a daily habit, like brushing your teeth. 15 minutes a day!]
(;B[eb]C[P: I dont know very well if this is a good move, but when my oponents do that I don't know well how to answer and I see they get many benefits.

Hon: This move, being on the second line, is played as an exception to take the corner territory. It is not an attacking move! If you want to attack the white stone, you should pincer him (see variation).]
;W[fb];B[ec];W[fd]TR[ec][fc][dd]C[Hon: Here I would strengthen the black corner. The marked stones show a typical bad shape - black is weak.]
(;B[jc]C[Hon: Black wants to pincer, but one important principle of attack says, you can not attack well, when you have weak stones yourself. 

First make a fist, then strike!];W[de]C[Hon: Since black has weakness ...]
;B[ce];W[df];B[cf];W[ed];B[cc]C[Hon: ... white easily gets some thickness ...]
;W[nc]C[Hon: ... and suddenly K17 ends up being too close to a very strong white wall. The attacker becomes the attacked!]
(;B[ob]C[Hon: Here again you play the territorial move, but if you play the same sequence as in the upper left, K17 will be even weaker. Like this you can only attack yourself.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[od];B[nd];W[oe];B[qc];W[pe];B[qd];W[nb];B[pb]
;W[lc]C[Hon: White made it a bit hard on himself maybe with this cutting variation, but K17 ends up isolated. If you want to attack, you have to do this to your opponent's stones!]
;B[me]C[Hon: Now if you come out you may be attacking the two white groups locally ...]
;W[kd]C[Hon: ... but when white comes out, it looks like k17 will have a hard time.]
;B[ie];W[ne];B[md];W[mf];B[le];W[jd];B[lf]C[Hon: This is okay. K17 was so weak to begin with, you can afford to lose him now.]
;W[id]
(;B[nf]C[Hon: There is a simpler way here.]
(;W[og];B[mg];W[ph]
(;B[qi]C[Hon: In my games I also enjoy hunting, but maybe in this case something else was more sensible.]
;W[ni]C[P: Here I see that I can start my attack. N13 gropu have n4 as a potencial eye and I can lean on j15, and q15 group has no eye

Hon: Yes, but you still got to watch out. Your group is not all that strong, N14 is only a "half eye", since white can play at O13. There is no second eye yet. So if you attack without care, you might become the prey yourself!]
;B[nk]C[P: I dont know well if its the wrong direccion, but I see its sente and its maps a great moyo

Hon: If you want a moyo, then maybe not going for whites base but sealing him would have been better. But since you played at R11, going here now and staking the game of the top group's survival is logical (and risky).]
;W[pi];B[qj];W[li];B[mc]C[Hon: This move has no function. It is an endgame (not a good one), loses a ko threat and a liberty.]
;W[mb];B[lb];W[kb];B[kh]C[P: I push from this side trying to reinforce my group, because it can have problems

Hon: But if now you have to play from this side anyway, your construction of a moyo is disturbed. You are following two strategies at one time, building up a moyo and staying alive on the other side. That's hard, also in an even game, since your stones fight against each other.]
;W[lh];B[kg];W[ki];B[ih];W[ji];B[he];W[hd];B[hj]TR[hi][ii]C[P: Now I think my group is strong enought and will not have problems

Hon: Here you still have cut aji, and N14 is no eye, so I think you should not feel too safe!]
;W[dg]C[P: I think this move is little and unnecesary, and give me chance to continue attacking the white group

Hon: I also think it is slow, but it increases the danger of a white cut through your keima, so watch out!]
;B[mj];W[ng];B[jq]C[P: I think that white group is diffficult to kill, so I take territory now and wait a better chance to continue attacking

Hon: If it's difficult to kill, then it was too early to play something like n10 now.]
;W[jk];B[ff];W[fh]
(;B[hi]C[P: Maybe g13 is better

Hon: I rather think, your keima here was not so good in the first place if you have to come back to defend.]
;W[cg];B[kl]C[Hon: I like your tenukiing in the upper left. White got not much from playing D13 and C13.]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[np]
(;B[on]C[Hon: Don't attack with weak shape!];W[po];B[oo];W[op]
;B[pq];W[pn];B[pm];W[qm];B[om];W[ro];B[qn];W[qo]
(;B[ql];W[rq];B[rm];W[qr];B[mh]C[Hon: This is the kind of move I was talking about. It is better to keep these moves for later. They are sente for you and gote for white, so first try to surround the whole group, then, if it doesnt live yet, you can think about this kind of moves to finish it off.]
;W[mi];B[nh];W[oh];B[ig]C[Hon: Now you have to come back to tidy up your own shape. So it was better to just play a surrounding move from the outside fist and keeping the situation flexible.]
;W[kk];B[ll];W[il];B[gl]C[P: Maybe its better to push in the other direction but I try to map a moyo

Hon: I think this is the right direction. Left side still needs build, while right side is settled, both colours being alive.]
;W[in];B[fg];W[fe];B[gp];W[qe];B[rg];W[re];B[qg];W[of]
(;B[ko]C[Hon: This side is not important.

You won't make points on this side, the potential is where your moyo is!]
;W[gm]
(;B[hl]C[Hon: This move is another of the bad kind. You take your own liberties and only strengthen white. Also you do nothing about your potential on the left.]
;W[hm];B[jm];W[im];B[el]C[Hon: You are stabilizing white for no reason, then retreat.]
;W[en]
(;B[fm]C[Hon: You only get weak shape for yourself. At another point you might want to play one point lower maybe, but after your move this chance is gone.]
;W[fn];B[go];W[em];B[fl];W[gn];B[cn];W[cm]
(;B[dl]C[P: I dont know well if my big mistake has been this move and some other like this letting him make eyes, or the general conception of the game, attacking the wrong way

Hon: The main problem is, that you try by all means to kill the white group, although you would have been able to just attack in a way, that the lower left turns into a single huge territory. What a waste!

Try to keep in mind, that an attack on the right is only good if it gives you profit on the left. Do never attack just to kill!]
;W[co];B[do];W[bn];B[dn];W[dm];B[bo];W[ck];B[cl]C[Hon: Another liberty taking move. Don't play them, just because they are sente!]
;W[bl];B[cp];W[cj];B[eh]TR[bk][ck][dk][ek][fk][fl][fm][fn][bo]
[co][do][eo][fo]C[Hon: You still profited a lot on the lower side by your attack, but I think, you could have gotten more points.

The rest is endgame and without comment.

If I look at the white group, then I see a long blind worm with no eyes. But in the end it lived anyway. The area of triangles is where you could have made additional points. Playing like this is putting all your money on one number. If it dies, you win, if it lives you lose. Attacking a group hard and even killing it is fine, but when you have an opportunity at hand to take a lot of points - right in front of your eyes! - then you should just take them and not throw them away for a kill that might not come.]

(;B[dn]C[Hon: Yes, this would have been good.

If in the end you manage to kill the group, of course everything is fine. But in most cases they just refuse to die, and then you don't have enough points.]
))
(;B[dn]C[Hon: Here.

Again this is a good touch because it seals the white group. It is no good idea just to let him destroy the whole left side.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[eo];B[do];W[ep];B[dq]C[Hon: Like this you make a lot of safe points.]
))
(;B[fm];W[gn];B[fn];W[hl];B[gk]C[Hon: Like this is natural. White helps you to increase your influence over the left side.

You may wonder why this should not be touching a weak group, but if the opponent looks for contact, you have no choice. The only thing you got to think about is that you don't play contact moves for no clear reason. If there is a good way to just seal the whole group, like here, then it is good. 

Igo means "surrounding game".]))
(;B[gn]C[Hon: Here!

You wanted to build up a moyo, so it's good to follow up here. White's voyage to safety is hard, and even if he lives, he will have played only on dame points.]

Hon: The keima attack you only play in the komoku josekis.]
;W[lq];B[jl];W[ik];B[gl]C[Hon: Maybe like this?]))
(;B[gg]))
(;B[ni]C[Hon: If you seal him like this, he has to live in gote.]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[qi];B[pl];W[qe];B[jp]C[Hon: The difference to the game is that you have no weak group in the center, his group is useless, and you have a nice moyo. White's points are not so many.]
))
(;W[mg]C[Hon: White could also go for confusion.]))
(;B[mg]C[Hon: Here. You strengthen your own group a bit ...]
;W[nf]C[Hon: ... then, if white connects ...];B[lh]C[Hon: ... white has to see how he can live inside your influence.]
;W[oh];B[ni];W[qi];B[qj];W[ri];B[rj];W[qe]C[Hon: Let's say you surround white like that and he lives ...]
;B[jp]C[Hon: ... then next you play here and have a great game.

Surrounding a group is an essential technique, especially if you have the potential for this kind of structure.]
))
(;B[je]C[Hon: There are some possible moves, but if you really want to play it safe, then just jump out from the weakest stone.

This is another principle of fighting: move from the weakest stone!]
;W[qf]C[Hon: If White counterpincers ...];B[oe];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[qd];B[og]C[Hon: ... you just separate him, wall him in and map out a nice territory.]
))
(;B[df];W[jc]C[Hon: After black has strengthened, white does so too. Now we see, that white is not under attack. Black does not need to be sad about it, since he has a large corner, but if he wants to attack, he has to pincer.]
))
(;B[jd]C[Hon: Whenever I play a six stone game, I play here.]

;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[mp];W[np];B[no];W[mo];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr]
;W[nr];B[kp];W[mn];B[om]C[Hon: If the same kind of thing happens in two corners, then this game looks already like an eight stone game, not a six stone game. Black is in perfect control of the overall influence, and all white has is two surrounded groups and a few weak stones.

In the upper left and lower right you see two different joseki. Also white can try some other moves, but black's method remains the same: He keeps the two stones separated so that two weak groups appear. If white wants the corner, he can have it, but he will be confined.

To attack a stone, you must take away its base (pincer), isolate it from its buddies (cut, separate), surround him. Like this you stay in control. After he's surrounded, if he can't survive, all the better, but if he lives, its also okay.]
