C[Here i think C6 is not too important. so i chose C14

reid: Off course you know that C6 is joseki, so let's examine your choice to not play it right away.  In the game, after black responds on the top side, you play next at C6, and your opponent responds as expected by extending along the bottom edge.  So there are really two questions here, one for black, and one for white.  First for black: if white had played C6 instead of C14, would black ignore it to to play at (or near) C14 instead?  I think we can all agree that a white move around K3 would be too terrible for black.

Now for white, if he had played C6 and black responds around K3, does white want to play next at C14?  Look at the white position on the left side after white's next move (C6): both stones are on low (third line).  This is not good development for white.  So even if white can justify not playing C6 now, he must play either C14, or the next move C6, somewhere else.  For example, C14 could perhaps be at F17, or C6 could go on D5 (NOT D6 as that is broken shape).

It would be easier to see this coming if white followed joseki :-)  In any case, there does not seem to be a strong reason to not play the joseki move.]

(;B[gc];W[cn]C[reid: as discussed in the previous comment, this should be high, at D5, because C14 is low.  This is actually made easier because black responded at G17 instead of F17 - the 3-3 invasion at C17 is easier for white, so the long distance from D5 to C14 is less troublesome for white.  Black F17 instead of G17 would make white's position slightly more difficult.]
;B[jq];W[cc]C[reid: This seems too early.  White doesn't need to settle C14 so soon since he can still extend to around D10.]

;B[ch]C[I invade 3-3 because i thought the wall of B would not work well because of C6.. Up to here i felt the game was good for me because the opponent let me get what i want.

reid: You are correct that C6 reduces the left side, but that just means Black has played some stones in the wrong direction.  B15 at D17 would be better for black, and C12, and possibly even A14 should be at D14.  Then black's wall faces towards the high stone at Q16, making a nice formation, while white is playing stones on the small (left) side.]

C[reid: small direction.];W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[qk];W[nd]C[be able to get O16 made me more confident

reid: Yes, black R9 would normally be at O17.  Black can be satisfied with this shape (O17) as he has mia to take the corner or to extend to L17.  The stone at R12 is less important than the corner stone.]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[oc];W[md];B[rd];W[re];B[mb];W[lb];B[nb]C[reid: White is not very satisfied with this outcome as the N16 stones are too close to the solid J17 formation.  No real potential for development here.]
;W[lq]C[M3 seems too far. I played this because i planned to attack at H3


reid: Yes, M3 seems to far.  Also, I don't see that attacking with H3 would do much for white.

But let's take a look at the board now.  Black's upper right corner is slightly larger than white's lower left corner.  Black's F16 wall plus extension to C9 seems at least as large as white's upper side plus N16.  And even if white placed M3 at O3 or N3, it doesn't look like his corner will be bigger than black's right side plus bottom territories.

But the real problem is that white has nowhere to expand, while black has several good ways to get more territory.

One hundred moves after this (at move 149), your comment says that white doesn't have much territory.  That has already been determined at this point.

How did it happen so fast?  I'd say it's because white concentrated on taking territory instead of focusing on the "direction of play" (which is a rather vague term that means paying attention to which areas are urgent and which directions are large).]
;B[nq];W[hq]C[reid: I don't think black needed to start this fight.  Extending to K5 instead of invading at L3 would be sufficient (black still has the R3 invasion up his sleeve).

While subsequent fighting could change the outcome of this game, I think the important points for learning are all before this.

I suggest that white should concentrate on his opening.  Try to make your stones work together across the whole board.

Avoid playing in small areas (where strong stones are on the third line), and on the second line (9 of the 26 stones white has played so far are on the second line).

Avoid taking third or second line territory if it means getting locked behind a wall (upper left corner).  Leave that for later in the game when you can reduce the influence of the wall.

Good luck, play strong!
