C[sronen71 [2k\]: Hi
sronen71 [2k\]: Enjoy

Dear Reviewer!

This is a serious slow game (50 min +5x50 sec) I played on KGS.
In this game I believe that I (black)  played the opening decently. All josekis are locally correct and
fuseki seems fine too. In the middle game I think I lost sente more than once and white took the advantage big way. I also tried to build two big moyos but white built even bigger one. I was able to invade it with great difficulty but as a result white could
invade easily into mine, split my groups, and I could hardly make life.
I think I should have taken more sente and also invade earlier into white open moyo, but am really not sure.

Thank you in advance for your review,

Shai

Chris: Hi Shai, my name is Chris, and I will try my best to review your game. After looking through this game, it is nice to see very little local mistakes (probably because of the long time settings?). As a general advice, I believe you should work on positional judgement and counting in endgame. It is important to chose the strategy according to necessity. For example accuratedly judging how much the invasion on the bottom was worth in comparison to the sudden loss of vitality on the right side, would have given you a possible win.]

;B[pp];W[oq];B[pk];W[qq]LB[jd:D][cn:A][fq:B][jq:C][qq:E]C[I played A
any clear perefence between A-B-C-D?

Chris: Here you will decide what type of game you want to play. B and C seem to be wrong direction. See how the move at E makes white incredibly stable. So we can regard it as thickness, hence play away from it. B may be possible, as there is more room to maneuver. Personally I prefer A, but a move at D would make a good moyo game also.]
(;B[cn];W[fp]LB[dj:B][bp:A]C[played A
maybe B better here, it seems to work well globally

Chris: Again it depends on what you prefer! A is very teretorial. If you regard the side and center as more important, you should play B. Since this game seems to become a moyo game, I would play B myself, for a speedier opening, leaving the 3-3 invasion possibility open.]

how should I respond?

I played A, idea also to separate two weak groups
B- seems overconcentrated
C - seems to passive]
(;B[mi]TR[he][oi]C[Chris: I dont see a clear way for Black to attack. Hence your assessment of N19 was correct.]
;W[ok];B[pj];W[oj];B[ol];W[nl];B[om];W[mk]C[Chris: Great success for White. Not only is Blacks moyo severely reduced but Whites potential on the bottom increases too!]
;B[fg];W[ji]LB[fg:A][ji:B]C[but now white seems almost connected so my plan didn't work well

Chris: Furthermore A induces B, which helps White, Blacks potential on the left is not big enough to win the game, so Black should have invaded.]
;B[hh];W[lg]LB[qh:C][en:A][hq:B]C[I played A
after game I think locally I choose B out of A and B
but C also seems urgent

Chris: Invading the bottom is very urgent now.]

I think should have gone for B

but seems very difficult to go in now
basicly I was messing around,
is there any clear way to do it?

Chris: The only weaknesses that are there are around A and B. It seems too late to invade now, maybe Black should go for the right side and try to win by endgame. By my count the game is still reasonable close. Within 10 points is my guess. So better play normal endgame.]

Chris: Beforehand the right side potential was around 25 points, now it is reduced to about 6. The marked pushin is worth less than 15, considering the possible endgame beforehand. So a "normal" endgame would have been a better plan.]

;B[qg];W[re];B[pg];W[qe];B[mf];W[li];B[mj];W[hi]C[white seems leading big way

Chris: Yes White is ahead. Taking the top right corner plus destroying the right side did it. As you can see the shape of the two right side Black groups was so weak, that the invasion on the bottom enabled White to attack very hard. Hence I believe securing the right side instead of the deep invasion would have been much better.]
