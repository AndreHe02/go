C[Hello and thanks for reviewing my game.  The person I was playing against was a 2dan and he didn't tell me until the match was over. He beat me by 31.5 but he was going easy on me.  Also, even if you are not a dan player, how would you rank my because I don't trust online ranks.

*: I am about 3k-4k somewhere there, so I might not be the best to comment the game, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Thanks.]

(;B[op]C[*: I don't like this approch.   I would recommend closing corner.

Order of moves:

1) Open Corner (4,4)
2) Open 3-4 Enclousre
3) Expension from sides
4) Kakari (approch a 4,4 or 3,4 stone)

So I would want to play E17 first.  That is the biggest point for you.  Please look at my variation.

*: This is a very tough opening move, leads to many complicated joseki and complications.]
;W[lp];B[on];W[qn]
(;B[qq]C[*: Wrong follow threw please look at my example.];W[rq]
;B[pq];W[rr]C[*: You are heavy, white is strong.];B[ol];W[ql]
;B[jp]C[was this a good pincer?

*: Nope.  Need to be at J4.];W[ln]
(;B[jn]C[*: Alternatively you can try M9 arena to stop white from running that way but your one stone at K4 willl be under attack then.  So I think better option here is tenuki, or play F3. Pleaes look at example.]
;W[ll];B[fp]C[artboy598 [10k\]: what's ur rank ?
pourfun: 2d

*: Hmm your stones at P4 are looking like they might need help; so playing F4 might be hasty.

*: But with pincer at K4 I don't think you can do much there, instead this move should be G4 to give your stones some stable base on the bottom.]
;W[hp]C[*: Okay now its family fight, between three black groups, which will you save?]
;B[go]C[Good answer?

*: it can be... lets see what you did.  What do you think whites goal is with H4?

In my mind it says that he wants to attack the K4 stones and F4 stones; so how can you make it so he can't attack both.  And instead he comes under attack?]
;W[jq]
(;B[iq]C[*: I like starting on the other side, L3 because if you can get to play L3 and L4 it makes your position stronger and helps your stones at P3 area.]
;W[ip];B[jo]C[*:  ?? This move... why? Trying to avoid KO?]
;W[ir];B[kq];W[jr];B[lq]C[*: Incorrect move, correct move was L4, now you can end up with another weak group to defend.]
;W[kp];B[mp];W[mo]
(;B[np]C[*: first take away liberties before defending, plese look at example.]
;W[hq];B[kn]C[*: bad move. my teacher always said if you are going to threath a cut .. just CUT IT.   This is hoping white will be nice...]
;W[lo]C[artboy598 [10k\]: did you go easy on me?]
(;B[ho]C[*: No meaning, containment is only good if you can gain something from it .. here nothing.. Recommendation 

1) Tenuki
2) Play tomake your bottom group stronger (example).];W[km]
;B[oj];W[er]C[*: recommend E17.];B[fr]C[*: you are just answering white, play your own game, this move keeps him sperate but also hurts you.]
;W[gr];B[fs]C[was this a good move?

*: Overplay.];W[fq];B[eq]C[pourfun: france];W[gq]C[pourfun: you?

;B[en]C[*: Wrong, shape was move needed.];W[cp];B[bq]C[pourfun: yes]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[gn];B[il]C[*: good .. but your game is lost mostly already.]
;W[gm];B[gl];W[jl]C[*: Your position is felling apart fast.]
;B[ik];W[kj]
(;B[el]C[*: Normally a shape move but here it's bad.  Because of the 1 point smae it leaves; creates weakness you don't need.  I recommedn F8, if white pushes give up two stones.  Look at example.]
;W[fm]C[artboy598 [10k\]: review after please with me];B[fl]
;W[em];B[dm]C[*: You can't save them so why try? Use them as aji nothing more.]
;W[dl]C[*: White to have fun :).]
(;B[dk];W[cl]C[*: You just gave up one more stone to white for no reason....]
;B[ck];W[cm];B[ii]C[*: E17 is the move my man.];W[nk];B[ok]
;W[nm];B[om]C[artboy598 [10k\]: so i need to work in my fighting?

*: I don't think fighting but more knowing when not to fight.   You need to learn to play defensively,  "if defense is good to have, then its good to spend time (moves) getting it" from Attack and Defense book.  White wasn't really fighting hard, just exploiting your weaknesses.]
;W[kh]
(;B[qj]C[*: Wrong Direction of play.];W[ig]C[*: This hurts your frame work now...]

(;B[hg]C[*: Don't answer him directly, a direct answer will only help him, even though J13 hurts.   E17 is still a big move.

*: Other way to answer this move might be G13.];W[ed];B[df]
C[artboy598 [10k\]: Tu bien!!!];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc]C[artboy598 [10k\]: any pro's games i should look at for reference?]
;B[be]C[*: Generally the joseki but I think you might want to try B18 because your strong below.]
;W[hc]
(;B[bk]C[pourfun: b9too small
pourfun: your first mistake
pourfun: b9

*: Yeap mistake I didn't keep track here; but there were minor mistakes before this.  This is big because this move gets you nothing, white is not going to make lots of space there, so you playing there is a free stone for white.   You need to play big moves, when lost for moves look at it this way:

1) Do I have any weak groups?
2) Does my oponent have weak groups?
3) Are any corners open?
4) Are there any sides open?

So if we follow that logic, weak groups not really.  Corners nope, but you have top side still open.  So that has to be before that, you are at early end game so leave moves like B9 for late end game.]

pourfun: 2 mistakes

*: Agreeded please look at comment on S16.];B[md];W[oh]
(;B[ph]C[*: His answer was alot more fun huh ;-).  This is where do you need to fight more? YES.  See there are two types of defense, active defense and passive defense.  You are always defending passively need to become more active.]
;W[pg];B[qh];W[og];B[qg];W[ld];B[mf]C[*: What does this accomplish?  No reduction, no attack, why not M15? At least you reduce him now.  The attack on his group in the middle might still be possible if you don't make it easy for him to connect.]

pourfun: thx
artboy598 [10k\]: thank you
pourfun: cu
artboy598 [10k\]: lets review
pourfun: ok

*: Final comments?

1) Your following white around too much.
2) Active Defense, not passive.
3) Don't over defend like with S10.  Too much.
4) I think you are at least 10K if not a little stronger; you have good understanding of life and death which I feel is the most important thing.
5) I think you need to work on middle game thats where things started to fell apart fast.  And I feel you never got over your lose on the bottom.
6) Remeber white won the fight on the bottom doesn't mean he is going to win it on the parts of the board also.  So don't let white bully you.

Thanks.])
