C[This game is an example of what I think is my big flaw. I might have won if I knew how to block invasions and cut enemy groups.

Thank you for reviewing.

Peti29:
Hi, I'll be reviewing this game. I will mark my comments with "Peti29:". I hope it will be useful to you.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[cp]C[d3 better for w?

Peti29: at your level (and even at mine) it's hard to understand the difference so early in the game. It depends on your long term plan which to choose. I believe it may be a very important decision at pro level, but for us kyus, both are just as well playable.]
;B[ep];W[cn];B[en]C[Peti29: You ask a lot about josekis. I advice you not to become too obsessed with them yet. It is more than enough to know only the most basic 2-3 josekis at 14k. You have to learn more important aspects of the game first.

Anyways I found this about the current situation:
http://senseis.xmp.net/?34PointHighApproachLowExtension
According to that b7 would be at C3. I say this not to contradict myself about josekis but because I don't really like the E4 E6 shape of black's stones.]
;W[qq]TR[nq]SQ[en][ep]C[Peti29: not the best place to invade IMO. Would be better at O3, especially that the marked black stones are placed so high.]
;B[pq]C[I thought I would look very good on the bottom after this.

Peti29: good.];W[pr];B[or];W[ps];B[oq]C[Peti29: Maybe a bit passive but since you're in a good position you can afford to play safe.]
;W[rr];B[qp];W[rp]
(;B[os]C[Peti29: Why? Nothing to fear (see variations).];W[ro]
C[Peti29: very slow for white.];B[qn]C[Xpose [14k\]: ty];W[qo]
C[atnnn [14k\]: np];B[po];W[rn];B[pm]C[This position looks weird, what would have been a good joseki? How should I have used my apparent strength on the bottom?

Peti29: I'm afraid this is far from any joseki :). You did well though. You have built a very strong wall and white is crawling on the second line with a very small corner. Could it even be better? ^^]
;W[dj]C[Peti29: Finally a progressive move from white. It might be better to attack the top right corner though.]
;B[fc]C[Peti29: nice :)];W[df];B[fe];W[fi]TR[nc][qf][gq]C[Peti29: That's very small. White has to attack now. (For example at one of the marked places.)]
;B[jj]TR[pd][fe][pm][en][oq]SQ[kd][qi][kq][er]C[I couldn't decide where to play. Where would have been best?

Peti29: At first I disliked this move because it is worth like 0 points. But looking at it a second time it works very well with nearly all of your other stones (triangles). It has great influence. As you are in a very good position you can afford a move like this. It's like a long term investment. So I like it now :).

I marked possible big points instead of tengen with squares.]
;W[qk]C[Peti29: this is ok for w I think.];B[pk]TR[qg]C[Peti29: In GO, every move makes a choice. You are saying with this move that you give up the right side in exchange for influence. You already got plenty of influence but you're short on territory so I'm not sure this is a wise choice. However now you got a huge moyo. Still, maybe something like R13 would have been better.]
;W[ql]TR[qf][qh][pj]C[Peti29: way too slow. White has to attack.]
;B[qm]TR[qf][qh]C[Peti29: even slower. You passed away your chance to claim back the side.]
;W[rm]C[Peti29: No need to connect. The R9 group has plenty of room to get life on the side and the corner lives already.]
;B[pl]C[Peti29: You wall is enormous now. You will have to try to turn it into territory soon.]
;W[lc]C[Peti29: White is way behind so he has to invade.];B[nc]
;W[ic]
(;B[ie];W[ke];B[qj]TR[kq][er]C[Peti29: Start to get territory on the bottom side / center instead. This is too small.]

(;W[rl]C[Peti29: This is meaningless (see variations).];B[nf]
TR[qg][kq][er]SQ[db][cc][jg][dl][cq]C[Peti29: Not good. This is worth like 3 points. There are much bigger points on the board (triangles) or better places if you want to fight (squares).]
;W[hd];B[cc]C[Was this a good idea? I wanted to attack left side before it became stronger, but I might have been to hasty.

Peti29: It's a good idea I think. Now you can steal the corner.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[cd];B[cb];W[gb];B[ec];W[gc];B[he];W[ge];B[gf]
;W[gd];B[ee];W[ed];B[fd];W[iq]C[Peti29: Whenever you have a big moyo like in this game. Your opponent will sooner or later invade. You must not fear this! It is good. You have to use your strength from your moyo to chase your opponent while making territory. You must not aim to kill the invader! Rather let him live small.]
;B[gq];W[lq];B[lp]TR[lo][jp]C[This and the following moves look bad now. What is best continuation at the bottom?

Peti29: White almost lives there. You don't want to try and kill those stones because it's likely that you'll fail and that'd cost a lot. Rather keep a distance and build territory while keeping white under pressure.

But your sequence is not particularly bad.];W[kp];B[ko];W[jp]

Peti29:
You played a good game. I saw some nice intuitive moves. What you have to learn (in addition to life-and-death experience) is that moyo is not equal to territory. You built a nice moyo (maybe even a little bit too large) but forgot to turn it to territory. When you have a big moyo you must never want to "save" all of it. You wanted too much and ended up having too little.

I hope I could help you to improve your play. Have many more nice games of GO!]
