DT[1996-03-20]TM[900]KM[0.5]HA[9];W[fq];B[dn];W[dr];B[cq];W[iq];B[lp]C[M4 is better at K3. If it is K3 White cant slide under your stones]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[ld]C[This a reckless move by white, all it has really done is make two weak white groups]
;B[mc]C[This is really being too kind on white, you should play O14 and try to split white. Next time you  play this move, I will play M17 and try to surround and possibly kill your corner.]
;W[mf];B[lc];W[oe];B[le];W[me];B[md];W[lf];B[ke];W[of];B[od];W[pm]C[Notice what has happened, because you didnt split white at the top, white developed thickness, Q7 takes advantage of this thickness to attack Q10. If you had split white, white would not have had thickness, would not have been able to pincer Q10, and Q10 would probably live]
;B[kr]C[Q7 was played to threaten to attack Q10, considering that the bottom is generally strong, I would advise playing O10 instead of L2]
;W[nj];B[pg];W[qe];B[ql]MA[pm]C[Dont try to live on the edge, in the best case black lives, but white manages to surround black with a thick wall. In the worst case white also gets to kill black. Especially in handicap go you should always try to break out into the centre, ie P9. REMEMBER: in situations like this white is often weaker than black. Once you play P9, the marked white stone would be very weak]

;W[pi];B[qi];W[qj];B[qk];W[rj];B[pn];W[oh];B[oo];W[cf]C[It might look bad on the right hand side, but your stones that did try to escape, even though they got seperated from the side have formed a very thick and valuable wall]
;B[df];W[dg];B[eg]C[E13 should be at E14, otherwise its too weak];W[ef]
;B[de];W[eh];B[fg];W[dh];B[fe];W[fh];B[gg];W[cl];B[dl];W[ck];B[cj]C[Black and white are similar in strength here, so you cant really expect white to be weak in this area, probably better to play at D9 but its hard to be sure]

;W[ei];B[gj]C[Not a bad result you now have a thick wall, but you have to be able to use it, you have fenced off one side of a large territory, its now natural to try to fence off the other, ie G5. When you think you are forming territory, look at its sides and think, where could I be most easily invaded]

;B[ho];W[hp];B[io];W[cc];B[ce];W[be];B[dc];W[rr];B[rq]C[This time white has lots of room on the bottom right, so R2 would be better]

;W[ks];B[ls]MA[kr]C[This is another tricky situation because your marked stone can be put into atari by M2, you have to give way to M2 yourself]
;W[lr];B[lq];W[kq];B[kp];W[kr];B[mq]C[This could have been at N2 white cant do anything]
;W[mr];B[nr];W[ms];B[or];W[qd];B[pc];W[qa];B[pa];W[ra];B[ip]C[Q15 would be better because it takes a point of territory of white and forces white to respond]
