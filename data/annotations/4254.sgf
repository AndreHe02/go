RE[W+R]

C[Hello, I am Jeffery from Hong Kong, SAR, China. Thanks for your time and reviewing my game.

I think in this game I was quite weak in defending my territories and saving isolated stones.

Nevertheless, I had chance to win this game by killing the whole system of white stones in the upper part, it was too bad that I missed the chance to strengthen my stones well, therefore I failed to kill and I had to resign.

Would you please point me out about my weakness, so that I can improve. Thank you very much.

Hi!  I'm also Jeff and I'll be adding comments here and there with variations on play.  Of course, I'm still learning and subject to mistakes as well.  Some of my variations may not be the "best" way to play, but I'm hoping you can learn from them and use them to work towards the "best" ways to play.  Based on your preliminary comments, I'll add some of my own.  Sometimes it's better to let those isolated stones die if you can use their death to build up territory around them.  Anyway, I'll comment more accurately on the game at the end.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[fc]C[Jeffery: I did this becasue I want to attack.

That's good.  It's a common way to start, especially on four star points.]
;W[jd]C[Jeffery: Am I responded correctly? I usually have problem when facing this W6 move. Can you give me some ways to respond this?

This move is more of a loose claim than anything else.  Most pincer moves are one stone closer and will have the corner support.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[fe];W[df]
(;B[ic]C[Jeffery: Did this move correct?

In my opinion this isn't bad at all.  Although that white stone doesn't have any support and playing that closely may give it some extra strength.  All three of my variations to this move deny white of a lot of options.  After that move though there are a lot of directions the play can go.  Try to build off of what you have, and you have that corner.]

(;B[pf]C[Jeffery: I played this because I want to jump faster that white, however, when white played at P15, should I respond like I did? Or simply block its way by playing at P14?]
;W[oe]
(;B[pe]C[This is heavy.  As we'll see later, heavy shape is hard to work with and hard to give up at the same time.]
;W[qh];B[qj]C[Jeffery: Did I respond correctly? I doubted!

It was right to try to push him towards your thickness.  But keep in mind you probably won't be getting much territory in the upper corner with this move.  Your aim should be to use R10 to build the lower right up.]

(;B[rd];W[oh]
(;B[of];W[me];B[ng];W[nh];B[mg]C[Jeffery: I played this just only want to escape, however, when I reviewed by myself, I think N12 is better, am I right?

Well, here's the thing: the upper left black is ok to live.  What running around like this is doing is allowing white to build up a strong army to attack that single black stone.]
;W[ql]C[Jeffery: Black19 was in danger, can I save it?]
(;B[qn];W[pk];B[cn];W[cl]C[Jeffery: Similar to left upper corner, I just have problem to respond this.

This is a much more common pincer against black's approach move.]

;B[kl];W[ei]C[Jeffery: Now, I think the upper white stones were a bit weak, hence I started attack. Did my sequence correct?

By my judgement you did an excellent job.  Compare what it looks like what has and what he ends up with.]

;W[fl];B[ig];W[jg];B[he];W[hd];B[mc]C[Jeffery: I tried to destroy its eye position.

This is a good start for that, but keep in mind your own weaknesses when attacking...K9 can allow him to connect, making the removal of eyes useless.]

Jeffery: In general, what is your opions about me in this game? Which aspects you think I have to improve?

Thank you very much again.

I think that when you attack groups of stones you should look more towards how your attacking group will gain from it (either territorially or influence) rather than trying to kill.  When anyone gets focused on killing another stone or group, they tend to forget about the rest of the board and can very easily ruin a good position.  Without looking at specific moves, this was the main problem in the end I think.  This seems to be the most important thing to work on (along with the little specifics I've mentioned along the way) plus start looking at some professional/higher-ranked games to see how they handle different opening moves.]

It is always stronger to attack without touching your opponent.  Touching a stone will make it stronger.  See how black is able to attack without touching here?]

(;B[oe]C[You may have heard the saying "hane at the head of two stones".  You want to stick to the strong basics especially in the beginning where little mistakes can add up to big points.
It may feel like your move was faster, but in the beginning strong shape is usually the fastest move other than tenuki. Look at how this opens up the right side as well as bends white back on itself.  It's a double purpose move.
If you look at josekis, you'll see that most stick to good shape and that's where the power of those moves comes from.]
