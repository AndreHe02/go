C[prana: I played black in this game and had a lucky win. But, I am dissatisfied with the first half of the game, as I think I made some major faults in positional judgement . I would be happy, if you could comment  the most obvious errors.

Thank you very much in advance,
Christian (prana).

forfun (ff): This is "lucky" game indeed.  We all play them from time to time.  The opponent outplays us in the early going but we manage to pull off something in the end (usually with the active participation of our - by then overconfident? - opponent).  There is a saying that covers this situation - "If you can't be good, be lucky!"  I have had to resort to it many times myself :-)

As I assess this game, I do not think that Black's strategic thinking is full of "big" mistakes.  Rather it is not sharp in this game.  One point is that it did not seem as if Black was thinking very hard about White.  This is something we are all guilty of more or less.  It is easier and generally more fun to think about "our" strategy.  Yet in Go half the plays are by our opponent, so their strategy is equally important.  When we pay too little attention to our opponent, how often they make us look foolish!  Alot of "strategy" in Go is nothing more than understanding where both Black and White are weak, and where they are not.  Almost all strategic plays have important follow up moves.  These revolve around weaknesses - either our opponent's or our own.  Standard joseki and fuseki do not encourage us to dig deep into the position in the early going.  I think that happened to Black in this game.  It was not until the corners had been occupied and the fighting spread out that Black started to some understanding and original ideas about the board as a whole.  By then it was almost too late...but this was indeed Black's lucky day in the end :-)]

;B[fc]LB[cf:A][qg:B]C[prana: I suppose, this is the wrong side. Better A or B?

ff: The play at B is far and away the most common idea here in order to better exploit White's weakness at R8.  However, there are at least a couple of examples of Black F17 that you can find at gobase.org or other game databases.  It is a reasonable idea.]

(;W[cf]C[ff: This reply is pretty conservative considering White's 3-3 stone in the lower left.  It would be more aggressive to play at D14 (see the variation).  This raises an interesting question for Black's next play.]
;B[jd]C[ff: The question here is whether Black should consider F17 a forcing move and play R13 now instead of K16.  This play at K16 is one normal idea in such positions, however, here it makes White's next play at R14 more valuable.  White has invasion points on the top (at M17 and H17 for exampe).  Compare this position (or the position after White's next play) to the position in the variation for C14.

An alternative idea would be to just play the low move at J17. This would make the invasion at the top less interesting for White and leave White wondering what to do with the combination of low stones at C14 and C3.]
;W[qf]
(;B[dp]C[ff: This is kind of a tough position for Black to decide what to do next.  White's positions are all relatively strong and the respective low stones at O3 and C14 mean that the remaining open spaces are not that interesting.  This is one standard play against the 3-3 corner but it is not clear where Black would like to go with it.  See the variation for another approach - not necessarily a better one :-)]
;W[cp];B[do];W[er];B[co]C[ff: This is a slow play that is seldom correct.  Basically if the left side is interesting, Black should start here by playing D6 instead of D4.  In this game the White stone at C14 is already low so no Black play along the left side will threaten it.  This play at C5 "forces" White to answer at D10, which is a play White wants to make anyway.  Most often White will answer this play with a keima at F4 but this is not interesting here because the low Black stone at O3 limits White's opportunities on the bottom.  Black should have continued with the usual play at G4 instead.]
;W[cj];B[gp]LB[fq:A]C[prana: is this too easy going? Now, I would rather play A.

ff: The play at A is usually based on some close Black support so that Black can fight successfully after White pushes up and cuts.  That does not seem to be the case here so G4 looks reasonable.]
;W[fq];B[gn];W[hq];B[ph]C[ff: Another idea here would be to simply play P15.]
;W[qh];B[pf];W[qe];B[pe]
(;W[jf]C[ff: White changes course in midstream.  Usual would be to play the hane at S16 (see the variation).]

(;B[rd]C[ff: This play is not small but seems to miss the dynamic point of the game.  Black may lose some of the corner territory but that is natural after Black chose to build a wall with Q12, Q14 and Q15.  Now the question is how Black will use that wall against the White stone on K14.  Black should want to answer K14.  It is a cap played against a stone on the fourth line - an unusual play.  See the variation for one idea.

An additional problem with this play is that it has no reasonable follow up.  There are enough White stones on the right that there is no threat.  Therefore this play becomes purely defensive.  It is essentially an endgame play.]
;W[kd]
(;B[ke]LB[kc:A]C[prana: too aggressiv? Maybe better defend with A?

ff: Probably true.  K16 is a fourth line stone so there is lots of room underneath.  Also the gap betwen K16 and F17 is wide.  Another idea would be to simply draw back with K17.]

(;W[jc];B[je];W[ic]
(;B[kc]C[ff: This cut is not effective here.  Black's wall on the right is already thick so capturing only one stone while White gets settled is not interesting.  See the variation.]
;W[kb]
(;B[lc]C[ff: This idea does not turn out well.  Black should simply capture the stone (see variation)]
;W[lb];B[mc];W[mb]
(;B[dc]C[ff: Fundamentally this play is in the wrong direction - away from the scene of the action.  See the variation.]
;W[cc];B[cb]
(;W[bb]C[ff: See the variation for another choice by White.]

(;B[cd]C[ff: This cut does not work out well.  Black should simply settle the stones here (see the variation).]
;W[bc]
(;B[de]LB[eb:A]C[prana: I wanted to weaken the white stones on the left side. But, this seems to be hopeless...

Better A?

ff: See the variation.  Black will also be disappointed with A, I think.  In the game, Black plays too big a price for the weakness of the White stones on the left.  When Black plays D17, the White stones at the top are not yet completely settled.  However, during the game variation, White takes alot of territory at the top and settles all the stones there.  The top started out as Black's framework.  Black should understand that the result was unsatisfactory because too much was given up.]

(;B[ee];W[fd];B[fe];W[gd]
(;B[cl]C[ff: This play does not have enough specific benefit for Black.  It seems more natural to invade here.  See the variation.]
;W[ch]C[prana: w is not really weak, b is not really strong, thus my strategy  was bad

ff: Up to here some of the ideas that Black has used were questionable.  That includes the assessment of White's stones.  In fact, from now on Black uses the weakness of various White stones in an attacking, center-oriented strategy.  It is not perfect, but with a little help from White, Black fights through to a win.]
;B[eh]
(;W[ck]C[ff: This does not turn out well for White.  See the variation.]
;B[ql]C[prana: too early?

ff: Black needs to get something started.  The only alternative is to continue against the stones on the left - something like E9 or E10.]

;B[mk];W[ni];B[li];W[mg];B[lh];W[ng]C[ff: White was probably happy to be allowed (forced) to jump into Black's territory this way.  However, it seems that Black has understood the situation in the center better.]
;B[ek]C[ff: This is a good play that shows that White's stones on the left are not safe yet.  Suddenly the center looks huge.]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[fh]C[ff: This just does not work and leaves the White stones still weak.  White should probably just play E10.]

(;W[ei]C[ff: Much better for White would have been this, I think.  White did not recognize that Black has a sizable weakness at G15.]
