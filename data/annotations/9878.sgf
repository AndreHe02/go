AB[pd][dp]C[Hello!
Thanks for reviewing my game :). It's been an expermental game for me. I've put some general questions and ideas in. Please feel free to show any kind of better moves anywhere and share your preferences .]
;W[pq];B[dd];W[qf];B[dj];W[nd];B[jp];W[lq]C[
janr: a bit slow?  Black is constructing a large framework.]
;B[jd]C[This feels okay to me for black.];W[oe];B[lo]LB[ql:A]
[po:B][fq:C]C[I'm not sure about this move, but i thought that was the way to continue the ongoing strategy. Maybe somewhere around A or B, or even C?

janr: A is ok
B feels too close to white's corner with already 2 stones
I like a shimari in the upper left more than C.];W[jq]
(;B[ip]C[
janr: I prefer to hane.];W[iq];B[hq]C[
janr: now, white is tronger and the hane is weaker.  It is better to hane immediately (instead of J4),]
;W[kp];B[ko];W[hr]LB[jo:A][hp:B]C[
janr: white lets black get solid.
Black has two cutting points at A and B which may be exploited at some point.]
;B[gq];W[gr];B[fq]C[janr: black's wall get very strong, white makes only territory on the second line.]
;W[cf]C[I feel fine up until now. What do you think?

janr: black got a good left moyo at the cost of the upper right corner.]
;B[ce];W[df];B[fd];W[bj];B[ci]LB[cj:A]C[I wasn't sure about this one either. Probably A would be better.

janr: yes I prefer A];W[bi];B[bh];W[bg];B[ch];W[ah];B[ck];W[be]

you can jump further to the right, e.g. A or B.];W[hf];B[ge]
;W[gf];B[hh];W[ig];B[ji];W[id];B[ie];W[he];B[hd];W[ic]
(;B[je]LB[jf:A]C[janr: A gives more pressure to the weak white group below. See variation]

LB[eb:A]C[janr: how about A?];W[kb]
(;B[kg]C[I guess this was too much.

janr: Maybe black can first lean more on the top border group?]
;W[kh];B[jh];W[kf];B[jf];W[jg];B[lg];W[lf];B[le]LB[qc:A][qe:B]
C[
janr: this doesn't work

In the end, black lives in the corner in ko, but just playing A or B is sufficient to live in the corner, leaving more aji.]
