C[FM: Hello, my name is Martin and I am the reviewer. My comments will begin with "FM" as my nick is Field Mouse.

*bearzbear*(08:35:19): Hi!

I played White in this game, and my opponent was my son. His rating was set at 10K to make this an unrated game, although his actual strength is about 1 stone weaker than mine. So the 1/2 point Komi was appropriate.

I have a number of key questions, mainly (but not exclusively) concerning direction of play for which i'd much appreciate enlightenment. Many thanks in advance.]
;B[dd];W[pc];B[ep];W[cp];B[dm]
(;W[eq]C[FM: turbogo says that this is a mistake from white]

(;B[fq];W[dq];B[fp]LB[dn:A][bo:B]TR[dm]C[FM: this result slightly favors white. In a common joseki, black marked stone is on A and black has a follow up sente move at B.]

(;W[cf]LB[fc:A][op:B]C[W10 This is my first key question.

- White is already alive in the corner, so I considered that continuing there was too slow. Was that decision correct?

FM:
 Yes. But this area is also small - black cannot build really big territory on the left side as it is still opened. If white wanted to play in this area, A would be better

- If I had decided to continue in the LL corner, What would have been the best play? C6? B7? Or?

FM: Continuing in the lower left corner now would be slow - black will answer anything there with K4 or something and will develop quickly. Generally B7 is the local continuation as it cannot be directly stopped (see variation). C6 is usable when black cannot answer C7 because of the cut.

- The only moves that I really considered here (in addition to the one played) were Q3 and P4. Was either of these preferable to what I played? And if so, which would have been better? Why?

FM: The P4 or Q3 moves were really better - the empty corner is big. I think they are both good, so you can chose any of them.

- Was there another move that I didn't consider that would have been better than any mentioned? If so, what? And why?

FM: I think that A and something around B are the only moves to consider now and I prefer B.]

(;B[ce]C[FM: mistake, black is forcing white to build some influence, which makes the black lower right position weaker.]
;W[df];B[fd];W[cj]LB[hc:A][dm:B]TR[ce][df]C[W14. Is the game reasonable for both sides here? And does either have the advantage? If so, why?

FM: The marked exchange was good for white - it god him some influence, which hurts black lower shape, and black territory has still open skirt at A. Also the B stone feels quite strange, so I prefer White here. But as black has sente to get the last opened corner, the advantage is not big.]
;B[qp]
(;W[oq]
(;B[mp]C[FM: agressive style of play, but it leaves the lower side too opened. I think black should play more calmly here.]

(;W[iq]C[W18. Right idea? If not, what would have been better? Why?

FM: this is very fighting style. I think white should just continue the joseki.

Is J3 the best point? If not, what would have been better? Why?

FM: When white had to invade, then the J line is good - white can extend to the L line and make some shape white aiming at connecting with the right stone. Maybye J4 would be a bit better as it makes black capping moves less effective.]

(;B[pq]TR[mp]C[FM: wrong direction, forcing white to make the marked stone separated.]
;W[op];B[qn]
(;W[lq]C[W22. This is the sort of development I anticipated when I played W18.

Is this satisfactory for White? If not, what would have been better?

FM: this move feels like white wants to sacrifice his two stones. Just jumping at P6 was good enough.]
;B[mq];W[on]TR[lq][mq]C[FM: the marked exchange was bad for white - he can no more play N3 or N2 or L4 as efficiently as before]

(;B[lr]C[FM: this area is not important and white should just ignore this move]

(;W[kq]C[FM: this does not help white much]
(;B[lo]LB[mn:A]C[FM: this move tries to attack both sides, but does not put white under much pressure. Simply jumping at A was better.]
;W[nr]LB[kr:A]C[FM: Now white can no longer play A to secure some eye shape in sente. There was no hurry with chosing between this and A; black would never play this move first in the near future.]
;B[mr];W[jo]C[W30. Here, I certianly believed that this development favored me. Was I correct? If not, why not?

FM: depends much on the fight outcome. But if I was forced to chose one side now, I would pick white.]

(;B[jn]C[FM: this move does not help black shape much, but it forces white to strenghten against the black left group]

(;W[io]TR[il][im][in]C[W32. In retrospect, I think that this is too slow, and that J5 would have been better. Is that correct? If not, why not?

FM: if you mean J6, then yes - J6 would be much better. Splitting black on the marked line is perfect for white]
;B[lm];W[pr];B[qr];W[qs]C[FM: white is too concerned about endgame now]
;B[rs];W[ps]
(;B[rq]C[FM: white is very happy that black answers here, black missed his chance]

(;W[ol]C[FM: this move is not very good. White should do more action here]
;B[pe]LB[in:A]C[FM: this move looks a bit strange, but after a closer look it is quite clever. Black is attacking white from the distance while approaching the last corner. Still the A move feels like connceting weak groups while attacking white and it is better.]

(;W[ql]LB[pm:A]C[W42. Would this have been better at R7? Or should I have simply answered at R15 in the UR corner?

FM: this move looks risky - what would white play against the A thing?]

(;B[qh]LB[qc:B][qj:A]C[FM: strange move. If black wanted to attack from this way, A was the move to keep white busy with defense. If black was afraid to extend closer to the white weak group he should play B first.]
;W[qe];B[qf]TR[qh]C[FM: this hurts, the marked stone is not very good now]
;W[qd]
(;B[pf]TR[qh]C[B43-47. I considered this far too slow for Black, and, with W42 in place, gave me the advantage. Was this jusgment correct? And if so, what should Black have played instead?

FM: this result is very painful for black. The marked stone is not effective.]
;W[pp];B[qq]
(;W[ro]C[FM: If black manages to split white in two, then this move is not optimal]
;B[qo];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm];B[pm];W[om];B[pl];W[qk];B[pk]C[FM: this result is good for black - white Q2 group is still very weak]
;W[qj]
(;B[ok]LB[pi:A]C[FM: this is too agressive. Black position is left with a very bad aji at A.]
;W[ml]
(;B[ll];W[nk];B[nj];W[lk];B[mj];W[mk]
(;B[jl]C[FM: the value of this move depends on how can black attacl the bottom white group when he gets sente]
;W[lj]
(;B[pj]LB[oi:A]C[FM: bad shape. Locally A was better];W[qi]
;B[ph]C[W50 - B73. Once again, I considered that I had profited by essentially stealing Back's potential LR territory while more or less safely getting my still weak  LR group out into the center.

Was this judgement correct? If not, how should I have played instead?

FM: this sente outcome is good for white

Please evaluate both side's prospects at this point in the game.

FM: Now white has more points than black, but black has stronger groups. The outcome of the game will depend on how many points black can make white attacking. The most urgent area now is around the J3 group - will it split black and become the hunter, or will black surround it and kill it or force it to live small, while strenghtening his own positons?]
;W[pi];B[oi]TR[pj]C[FM: Looks like black played this place anyway and now the marked move feels sad.]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[og];B[ng]LB[jj:A][gn:B]TR[oh]C[W74 - B79. Intended to set up some Aji for later use, but in retrospect an error. What should I have played instead?

FM: You are right, p12 was a big loss. A or something around B would be better instead of the marked move.]

(;W[mn]LB[ko:A]C[FM: It is aji keshi - white A now loses its power - it is a bit similar to the O2 move.]
;B[ln];W[mm]C[FM: Very slow move. The white group is not 100% alive even with this move, so at some point it will run into the centre anyway - most probably.]
;B[oc]LB[gn:A]TR[ln][mr]SQ[mm]C[W80 - B83. Played to guarantee one eye for the big weak group, but in return it allowed B83.

Would I have been better served by simply playing W80 at O17, and allowing the weak group to fend for itself in the center? This sequence made a huge difference in final score, so the answer to this question is crucial.


FM: It looks like that both black and white are afraid to play in the centre - white is making one and a half eye with his Q2 group and black is ignoring the area at all. If A can kill (I think it has a fair chance as black got the two free moves that make his surrounding walls aji-invulnerable) then it is the point of absolute importance. And even if it cannot kill, it will connect black groups and force white to live very small in gote. Locally this area is not small and looks important, but in global point of view the player who will start to solve the center problems first will have the advantage. As I said in the variations before, A is the super move for both sides.
If i compare the last two moves - white square and this black - then black got a huge profit and suddenly is quite back in the game.]
;W[ob]
(;B[nc];W[nb];B[pd];W[qb];B[mc]
(;W[fm]C[W90. This was the point of my acting to assure at least one eye for the weak LR group, because I felt that I could now try to separate and attack the two weak Black groups with relative impunity. Was this a sound judgment? If not, why not?

FM: Yes! Separating two weak groups that could potentially connect and get strong is very good. And if it helps your own weak group it is even better.

This was the only rational starting point for the attack that I could see. Is there anything better? If so, what? And how would that work out?

FM: this move looks very optimistic and requires a very good plan against black counter attacks. I suggest just G6.]

(;B[em]C[FM: Black resigns for his role of attacking player with strong groups and lets white to split his groups]
;W[fn];B[do]TR[em][fm][fn]C[FM: the marked exchange was a disaster for black - the powers of the groups on the board are shifting now]

(;W[bn]LB[ej:A][hm:B]C[W94. Taking profit while keeping the pressure on Black. At this point I liked my game. Was that judgment correct? If not, why not?

FM: this move is not small and it has quite good continuation, but it also lets black to jump out and get some initiative in the centre.]
;B[ek];W[hn]LB[hk:C][fl:B][hm:A]TR[bn]SQ[ek]C[W96. My own center group is still weak, so I am cautiously  assuring that it stays connected, and therefore isn't likely to die. But this move is clearly slow, although I really can't allow Black to play on this same point. So was there a better alternative here? If so, what? And how would that have played out?

FM: this move was not slow - it was just a must and it is a good move. Slow was the triangled move which made black fast by playing the square. Locally I think A was better - white would be able to answer B with C.]

(;B[in]C[FM: black does not get anything by this push];W[go]
;B[jj]C[FM: black should just connect his groups solidly instead of making an illusion of connection]
;W[lh]C[FM: white is happy to jump in this area];B[cl]C[FM: not so small, but there are more important things to do]
;W[ei]C[FM: nice move];B[cn];W[bm];B[bl];W[en]C[FM: this move is gote - was it necessary?]
;B[co];W[bo];B[ej];W[mo];B[lp]LB[di:A]C[FM: here I was long thinking about what if black played A instead of this connection... but turned out connecting at M4 was really the best :-)]
;W[di];B[hk]TR[lh][di][ei]C[FM: after all and after giving white free marked stones black connected his groups]

(;W[fk];B[fj];W[gk];B[gj];W[hl];B[il];W[hj];B[ik];W[hm];B[hi]
;W[fl]
(;B[el];W[lf]LB[kg:A]C[W126. Not thought through! L15 was necessary. I feel that this was the losing move, and that with L15 instead I should have won. Is that correct? Or?

FM: L15 would be risky too, black would split at A and don't forget that you will have to invest one more stone to the eyes of the Q2 group. I think it would be enough if you played A yourself.


No further questions after this point.
