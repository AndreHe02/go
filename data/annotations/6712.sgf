C[ialwmgs67: Hi!
mineteaser: hello

-- Hello, my name is Sven and IÂ´m about 8 kyu at Dragon Go Server and around 13 kyu on KGS. All my comments are preceded by "--", so you can more easily spot them.
If something remains unclear or you have additional questions, do not hesitate to write me! I hope I can help a bit.

-- In fact, I could not make out many serious mistakes. As concerns your reading skills and fighting, I daresay the game was well balanced! Only at some important points you played too defensively and should have put more pressure on White. From time to time during the game, you should keep in mind that the whole board is important and you should take account of your and your opponent's spheres of influence resp. future territory.]

By now, White has gained substantial influence not only towards the left and lower edge, but also towards the centre by the marked stones. Black could invade at A or B, for example, thus reducing White's influence or future territory.]
