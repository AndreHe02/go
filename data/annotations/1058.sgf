C[If I counted the game correctly, White is ahead by 1 point on the board, 6,5points with komi.]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[qe];W[dd];B[qn];W[mq];B[pj];W[fq];B[cn];W[dr]
;B[cq];W[ip]C[Even if the usual shape for 12 is on the third line, I agree to play on the fourth line, for a more balanced shape.]
;B[pc]C[The only problem with Black fuseki is that he is playing a shimari with an extension in the wrong side.
May be Black should have played on the 3-4 for his first move in the top-east corner]
;W[jd];B[lc];W[oe];B[nd];W[pi]LB[qf:B]C[Usually played at B]
;B[qi];W[qh];B[oi];W[ph];B[qj]LB[oh:B][ni:C][mg:D]C[White should push at B before playing a keima at D in the center]
;W[ng]LB[oh:B][qf:C]C[White has a defect at B. He hould have play tsuke at C or B.]
;B[qq]LB[oh:B]C[Should play at B];W[qp];B[rp];W[pq];B[rr];W[qr]
;B[rq];W[oj]C[Big move.];B[pl]C[May be too mild.];W[gc]LB[nj:B]
C[Should play at B];B[kq];W[ir]LB[kp:B]C[I would play at B. Too conservative but it is possible too.]
;B[cd]LB[ko:B]C[Should jump at B];W[ce];B[be];W[de];B[cc]LB[bd:B]
[bc:C]C[Joseki is at B or C];W[bf];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[ed]
;W[fc];B[ad];W[cg];B[ck]C[Seems OK as it reduces White ability to do a moyo by playing there.]
;W[db];B[cb];W[ea];B[bc]LB[ab:B][af:C][ag:D]C[This not a good shape. Black should play at B as the move at C or D will not be sente (small mistake)]
;W[pn];B[qm];W[ko]C[Seems big.];B[le];W[nj]C[Big too.];B[lg]
LB[jf:B]C[I would play 61 at B to reduce white territory.];W[qd]
LB[jf:B]C[Not urgent and gote as we will see. B is bigger];B[pd]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qf];B[qc];W[pe];B[ie]LB[jf:B]C[This 69 is too deep and should have been played at B as White can cut this stone due to its strength on the top west.]
;W[kf]C[With this sequence, white manages to get some points and took the lead.]
;B[ke];W[je];B[jf];W[if];B[jg];W[ig];B[jh];W[he];B[ih]C[This result is good for white...]
;W[fn]LB[cr:B][qo:C][om:D]C[This 80 move is not so big. Why not pushing once at B. I think it is the biggest point. After, I would play near C and D]
;B[jc];W[id];B[on]C[Good exchange for Black.];W[no];B[cr];W[cl]
;B[bl];W[bk]LB[hh:B]C[This 88 is good tesuji, but I think white did not get so much with this sequence. I will play at B instead of 86.]

;B[lo];W[lp];B[kn];W[jo];B[fi];W[fg];B[pr];W[or];B[qs];W[jb]
C[Good move and very big];B[kc];W[ib]LB[ic:B]C[Black should test once at B as if White Blocks, he will not get a so good yose with the monkey jump]
;B[rf];W[qd];B[os];W[nr];B[qe];W[af];B[ae];W[qd];B[gg];W[gf]
;B[qe];W[mf];B[lf];W[qd];B[er];W[eq];B[qe];W[qo];B[ro];W[qd]
;B[dq];W[fr];B[qe];W[rg]LB[ab:B]C[White should go on the ko, play at B]
;B[se];W[es];B[gm]LB[ic:B][kb:C]C[This move in the center is not so big. Play once at B and then at C]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[im];B[il]LB[gn:B]C[May be better to play at B and exchange territory]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[gn];B[gl];W[jl];B[kl];W[jm];B[jk];W[kk];B[kj]
C[This 51 is not so good as it helps White to swallow the black stones in the bottom.]

;W[la];B[sg];W[rh];B[na];W[kb];B[lb];W[ka];B[nb];W[mn]C[Good.]
;B[nm];W[lm];B[oo]C[Good combination but ...];W[op]LB[np:B]
C[Should be played at B and White is clearly ahead.];B[ln];W[km]

C[Good];B[nn];W[po];B[ne]LB[pf:B]C[Befoe playing at 99, play once at B]
