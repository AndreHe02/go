;B[qc];W[qi];B[cf];W[ch];B[fd]SQ[jd]C[was this move a good idea ?
*here a classical joseki with c17 is good because white has no extension around k16.
Also the double approach seems good although it's not considered joseki, in fact f16 seems to work well with black upper right stones]
;W[df];B[dg];W[ce];B[ef];W[de]
(;B[fg]C[I think this is an error because white cutting gains a lot of points and black has in return only a little influence.
Enclosure at c13 would have been better because a white cut at e13 leaves a lot of aji and maybe a semeai in black favour. (see var)]
;W[cg];B[ph]C[*this is a small reduction now. k16 would be better. If you are trying to build a moyo it's premature because you don't have stones near the center of your moyo and white could easily live aroundj17 and reduce the moyo from both sides]

(;B[jc]C[*paceful pincer, in this way u let white live easily connecting and also reduce your framework gaining a few  points on the side.
Another kind of answer would be the cut but white, letting him create a base around l17, could easily live or escape

*as i told you before you had a moyo with a kind of hole so now u can be satisfied of your influence you couldn't think the whole zone was yours.]
;W[ec];B[ji];W[nj];B[mj];W[ni];B[mi];W[nk];B[ej]C[too passive ?
*the side is bigger (c8 maybe) and u can build a  moyo also in the lower side]
;W[cn];B[en];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[co]C[*now it's time to make a little count to realize if u are behind or ahead.
take a look:
white:  35 upper left corner
 10-15 lower left
 40 on the right side (if you decide to keep the game simple,not invading)
total=about 90+komi

black: about  55 in the upper central zone
 about 35 in the lower side
i counted nothing around k8
total=90

the only problem with this count is that i didn't take care of the solidity and shapes. As you can see white is more solid than black and can reduce your moyo better.

My advice is to not keep the game simple (as you can do if you would be many points ahead) but to reduce strongly white trying also to strenghten your weak framework.]

is the exchange d8 c8 favourable? Yes i think, white gains a side but your moyo becomes strong]

any advice ?
thank you in advance
*Your game was moyo -oriented and as you can see it's not always worthy. 
The joseki where you made a mistake was on the upper left corner and in that zone white gained a lot of points.
Your central moyo has become much smaller 34 points including dead stones.

I hope my review would be satisfactory.

For further explanation, comment, variation or simply go-related question you can find me on kgs as "fonta"]
