C[thanks so much for reviewing my game i just wanted some thoughts on how i could improve and what parts im lacking. . thnaks again.

V: I will show variations/comments with a V: prefix. I will give you alternatives to what happened, it does not mean that my suggestions are the best, they will just be alternatives to give you a new way of thinking. I will try give options which will make sense to you.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp]C[V: this seems to help white. See Variation]

(;W[dd];B[oq];W[pj]
(;B[qg]C[here i was thinking that it was as far i felt comfortable to go to apply pressure and make a extention.

V: black's move was not the biggest move. see Var];W[md]
(;B[oc]C[i played here. i was afraid that if i played one farther that a 3-3 would wreck my corner cuz it would be hard to attack the n-16 stone to regain the profit. and am confused on how a full enclose of a 4-4 is not invadable with a 3-3 if you could clear me up.]
;W[qn]
(;B[fc]C[V: this can be interesting because N16 is hurting]

;W[cg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]C[i think usually you end off with a one point jump. but i wanted sente

V: because of white's shape black can not do 1 pt jump, see var]

(;B[fq];W[fp]C[V: white is going for influence with this move, black should keep this in mind for future moves.]
;B[gp];W[fo]
(;B[eq]C[V: this move makes white stronger, and does not help B, see variation]
;W[dq];B[iq];W[lq]C[he didnt finish his joseki and i didnt know how to punish or how to play against this . so try to force it down and make it live.

V: if black wants to force white down,  see variation]
(;B[kp]C[V: this seems to help white on the left and black F3 group is not gaining any territory.]
;W[mp]
(;B[oo]C[jump ahead to get it to cap it.

V: see var, make white choose the group.];W[mn]C[now where to get profit from attacking a weak group. i was thinking the group on the right. and keep him disconnected.]
;B[om];W[pn];B[on];W[pl]C[i peeped the group. wouldit have been better to cut it..

V: my teacher says don't peep when you can cut, it seems to me peeping makes white stronger and does not help black]

(;B[lo];W[mo];B[km]C[trying to get ahead.];W[ml]
(;B[ok]C[peep trying to get him to connect to cap or something.]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[nk];B[nm];W[mk];B[mm]C[V: black is not strong enough around M5 to peep here. see var]
;W[ln];B[lm]C[i wanted to get get him to puch one more to block and then force him to atari my one stone.]
;W[ko]C[now to kill the group];B[jo];W[kn];B[jn];W[jq]C[if i connected my stone he would do hers. and she would have room for an eye so i desended.]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[jr];W[lp];B[jp];W[mr]C[now i need to poke out the eye i thought.and after i was thinking thato2 ans start a ko but dont know any ko threats i have.]

;W[ls];B[lr];W[gq]
(;B[hq];W[kr];B[dn]C[then i thought of this as a ko threat but didnt think this was a good ko threat. and was wondering about a better one.

V: if black looses the ko, take advantage to the new stone.]
;W[js]
(;B[is];W[ks];B[or];W[ns]C[then i thought i could of cut it off but.then its alive and i feel to the push.]

(;B[cl]C[V: too slow and will make white stronger.];W[dj];B[bi]
C[V: too low, making white stronger, wrong direction for black]
;W[ci];B[bh];W[bj]
(;B[ck]C[V: black just made white stronger and does not help black, by this time black is going to be fighting, too many weak groups. last comment.]
