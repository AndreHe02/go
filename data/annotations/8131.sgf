C[Hi, thanks for reviewing my game.
I've added in some questions in the game tree. If you could point out a few main concepts or techniques that would improve my game, that would be most helpful. (I played as black, but pointing out White's mistakes is helpful too.)

Hi, this is Wonodan from KGS, I will try to add my comments with W: in front of them so they're more easily noticed.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc]
;B[ck];W[qj];B[jd]C[I took K16 instead of r13 or R7 because K16 seems to be a good point for B and W.

W: Yes, this is a good plan.];W[qn]C[I wanted to attack W's group on the right, with R8, but I need to build up some strength first, right? How can I do this, with the intention to attack W?

W: White has more stones in this area, so defending makes sense instead of fighting. Safe fighting for areas where you're strong, like top and left at the moment.]
(;B[mp]C[W: The corner was never black's, but after this high move it's even harder to claim later.]
;W[rp];B[qq]C[W: After a big move like N4, it is not a good idea for white to slide at S4, as black gets such a big territory in the corner. White should've played something else instead of S4, bottom right is now very good for black.]
(;W[qf]LB[qh:B][ql:A]C[W: At this moment you have two attacks on white right side group, A and B. Three space jumps are too far apart from each other to be completely safe.]
(;B[qe]C[W: This move only helps white.]
(;W[pf]LB[qg:1][qh:2][qi:3]C[W: The common rule of extending is "Height of wall + 1". White's wall is two spaces high, so he should extend three spaces. In this case, black helped white gain optimal shape.]
;B[nc];W[hq];B[jq]C[W: Good move.]
(;W[cq]LB[fq:A]C[W: This move looks odd. Black threatend to invade at A, but instead White defended the corner.]
(;B[cn]
(;W[co]
(;B[en];W[bn];B[cm];W[eo];B[fn];W[pl]C[W: White fixed final weakness in his shape at R8, and it looks too dangerous for black to invade at R12 as white already has Q14 to protect against it.]
(;B[hp];W[gp];B[ho];W[go];B[gn];W[iq]
(;B[fe]
(;W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[ie]TR[jc][jd]C[W: Best move in this area. When it's possible to hane (turn over) two or three stones like this, it's usually the best move available. This white shape will have trouble from now on.]
;W[jb]
(;B[jj]C[In hind sight, I think I should have played L18, then played k10 later.]
;W[kl]
(;B[ml]
(;W[ip];B[io];W[jp]C[W: Don't cling to weak stones that have no meaning.]
(;B[kq]TR[kl][jp]C[W: If white can connect these stones, he will score a huge success.]
;W[jo];B[im]C[W: Good move.];W[jm]
(;B[kb]C[W: Protecting the one stone here feels small...]
(;W[ib]
(;B[nf];W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[ni];W[il]C[W: White's best move, definately.]
;B[hl];W[in]LB[jm:D][ho:A][gp:B][ip:C]C[W: This is a white mistake. Group A does not cut anything. Groups B, C and D are already connected. Black could not care less about the A group. Black has a move to win the game here, by sacrificing the 3 stones. Where is this move?]
(;B[hn];W[hm]C[Ack, should I have played H9 here instead of F7?

W: Absolutely. I'm very glad you noticed it yourself!]
(;B[gm];W[hk];B[im];W[ik];B[gk];W[hi]
(;B[gi];W[gj];B[fj];W[hj];B[fi];W[hm];B[bm]C[W: Good plan to let go of the H8 stone.]

;W[kb];B[hf];W[ge];B[gf];W[fd];B[ee];W[bo]
(;B[jh]TR[kl]C[W: Trying to protect territory in this area is futile, as white has the marked stone already in place.]

;B[om];W[nl];B[pn];W[pm];B[po];W[ol]TR[ed][og][hh][fl][an][sp]
[hs]C[W: Capturing this stone is worth about 1Â½ points for white. All marked moves (for example) are a lot bigger.]
;B[on]TR[ae][af][am][an][sp][sq]SQ[ag][bg][al][bl][rr][sr]C[W: The marked exchanges got white a lot of territory, and this is where black lost the game.]

[ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Once again, thank you for the review!

W: It was my pleasure to review this game, I hope this helped. 

The biggest opening and middle game problems were your greediness. Do not forget to defend early, or later you won't find enough time to do so.

I would suggest you to be careful when selecting endgame moves, as you were leading but white won because he played bigger moves in the end. Had you played bigger moves instead, the game would have surely been yours. 

I hope you have enough time to check moves: 39, 45, 51, 65, 125, 147 and 167 again, with any of these moves either the game would have been a lot easier, or possibly won.

If there's something unclear, you can try to find me from KGS under the nick Wonodan (I use it rarely), and you can also try to contact me by e-mail : lauri.vihavainen@gmail.com]
