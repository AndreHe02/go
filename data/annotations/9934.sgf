Cybercage [5k\]: #ASR league

Dear Reviewer:
First, thank you for your time and review. I am marked as 4k, but I might be 5k or thereabouts. This is an ASR game from KGS, 30 minutes +5x30.
I have some specific questions that I would like assistance, if possible.  I also appreciate any other comments you would like to add.
1) This is the first time I tried playing Kobayashi opening. I know I was a bit greedy and got punished for it.  If you could comment on the fuseki through move 23, I would appreciate it.  I put some comments in there as well.
2) At move 23, I am wondering how best to respond to the invasion.
3) Move 60, life and death question.
4) Move 97, question about how to make the most from invasion or make aji.]
;B[pd]C[J: Hi my name is Jay, I'll be reviewing your game. My comments will start with "J:"]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qk]C[J: Approaching at R6 or Q6 is more common for white in the Kobayashi.]
;B[qn];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[pi]C[J: White's Q12 reduces more local aji later.]

(;B[cf]C[For Reviewer: I think 15 should be at N4, perhaps.  This is where I started to get too greedy.

J: C14 is OK, as is F17. Playing on the bottom side now would let white play F17 to start building a corner. Even with another move like N4, white still has reductions at H3, and aji around P3/Q2/R3.]
;W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[jc]C[J: K17 is a bit slack, M17 is more active.]

(;B[fn]C[For Reviewer: This was also an option.  I should have played back at N4 instead.

J: Extending upwards is a good idea for builing a moyo. F5 is more solid. That way, the bottom side is stronger and C3 is a good reduction for black.]

(;W[mq]C[J: N3 is an inflexible invasion. White can instead try O3 which aims at R3, or P3 which gives forcing moves. See variations.]

(;B[np]LB[lq:A][mp:B][nq:C]C[For REviewer: So, I was too greedy and got invaded.  What is the best response to 22? I know my response was not severe enough and did not help me.  I was thinking that A, B, or C was better.

J: O4 doesn't look like the right direction here; black isn't making any terriory this way, nor is white sealed. Generally, when attack a stone, do not touch. O4 diagonal is almost touching here, and it makes white stronger.

J: L3 seems to be a better direction. Black gets to deprive white's base while solidifying some territory. See variation.]
;W[mp]C[J: After O4 N4 trade, white has more liberties locally.]
;B[nn]C[J: No need to be light here, O5 is enough. White is pushing from behind.]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[no];B[oo];W[op];B[pp];W[mn];B[nm];W[mm];B[nl]
C[J: it feels like white go out pretty easily, and black's wall is facing a strong white group.]
;W[jq];B[iq];W[ip]
(;B[ir]C[J: J2 looks like it leave black with too many weaknesses. H3 here is safer. See Variation.]

(;B[hm]C[J: Black has no choice but to connect F5. See Variation.]

;B[dq];W[cq];B[cp];W[fr]MA[fp][fq][dq][dr][iq][ir]C[For Reviewer: I had assessed this bottom group as dead for black.  I think white could have killed it.  In the game I lived in Gote.  Is there a way to live in Sente or to take profit from this group aji?  Is it dead if white plays correctly?

J: It seems that there is too much aji locally for white to kill black. In these situations it's almost impossible for black to take sente.  But white can't be satisfied with having a weak group at N7.]

;W[lr]C[J:White should should jump out to around K9 to keep the outside while putting pressure on black's disjoint group.]
;B[cl]TR[dm][em]C[J: The relationship between stones is strange here, white can still cut this. D7 makes for a better connection.]

(;W[df];B[dg];W[ce];B[bf];W[ef];B[eg]C[J: White's trades here are heavy and unproductive. Instead, white can try leaning strategy starting with D8. See previous variation.]
;W[en];B[fl];W[mj]
(;B[jj]C[J: F14 is larger. See variation.];W[ff];B[gh];W[lc]
C[J: White should ask S17 first.];B[rc];W[fm]C[J: After black's S17 white really needs to check the aji in his group. F7 is tiny.]

(;B[rh]TR[nc][pd][ph][qc][rc][qg][qh][nj][nk][nl][nm][nn]C[Cybercage [5k\]: oh?
Cybercage [5k\]: interesting :)

For Reviewer:  I have a small wall and some potential to mess with the group on the right.  How can I maximize profit from this position?  I overplayed, I think.

J: There is definately aji here. It just take a lot of reading to find the best reduction. The marked points are the usual key points in this shape, but it looks like R13 is most promising. See variations.]
;W[qh];B[jg]TR[bb][mb][re]C[J: K13 is small actually. If black were to play anywhere larger, the game is still pretty even. Marked points are bigger endgame.]

;B[re];W[se];B[qi];W[pk];B[oj];W[rj];B[sg]C[J: No need for T13, waste of ko threats. This is my last comment.

J: All in all, in this game, white made more mistakes in the opening, but black didn't take advantage of attacking a deep invasion by white on the bottom side which lead to black being infavorably cut. At that point the game was still quite even, but then black lost a lot of points in the endgame.

J: The take away from this game is try to find the correct direction of attack in the middlegame, ie. attack with a pupose; and to focus on finding the largest move in the endgame, where an amateur "can lose 30 points."]
