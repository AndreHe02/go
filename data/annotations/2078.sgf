C[I know this game was a swift knock-out -- but I ended up with a few specific questions.  I've been playing a lot of Go Seigen games lately to change my style -- and I honestly don't know if I played well against black, or if I swindled him.

Thanks for you time.];B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[mp];B[po]
;W[do]C[Is the lower side a reasonable response for white to the chinese opening?  Is the relationship between the d3/d5 stones and n4 reasonable?

The distance is a bit too far.  In fact, the problem move is N4.  N4 should be around R3, the B has the choise to enclose or to extend -- either way, B leaves the other to W.]
;B[jd];W[cj]C[Should be d10?

Yes.  At the moment, seems all the stones are at the 4th line, if should play at the right side, "high" is preferred than "low".  However, I would R4 or R14 instead.]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[ge];B[ed];W[fe];B[ec];W[ee];B[de]C[I expected the joseki at d17 instead of the cut . . . .

B should H16; yet W can't D17 -- the D15 cut works instantly.  Even after B H16, W D17, when D15 doesn't work directly, it will be W's weak spot awaiting for B's invasion -- plus B has E10 and L4....]

;W[cd];B[bc];W[bb];B[cf];W[ac];B[md];W[he]C[Seems like the vital point to keep my flank from being rolled up?

This is a very good move indeed.];B[ie];W[hg]C[Again, seems necessary to me -- but I'm worried it's slow.

I would G12 instead of H13.  Both R17 and J17 are still opened, B's moyo is not as solid as B wishes it to be.  W's only weak sopt now is N4.]
;B[jp];W[hq]C[Reasonable?  My thought is that if he blocks me from connecting through below, n4 is still very light + I've aji at r7 and a possible anchor out at h13.

No.  W doesn't have aji at R7.  The reason is that using R7 will make B's upper solid -- W R7 B R9 -- as W try to run R7, the upper will get bigger, plus N4 will be dead naturally.  W becomes a perfect target without chance to strike back.]

;B[qo]C[Ooch....  B should have O6.  One of W's group will be dead for sure.  With Q7 is opened, W can't slid in S5.  If W tries to live the corner using R4, B R5 -- corner is OK to live, but the two groups outside will be double played.]
;W[nn];B[jl]C[I];W[nk]C[If b had o9 instead of k8, I had intended m7.  The white group on the right is really the crux of the game for me.  I'm trying to figure out if I played nice and light, or if my opponent let me get away with murder. :-)

Your opponent let you get away.  B should have O6 instead of R5 to star with.]
;B[oi];W[ni];B[gn]C[B is ignoring the main battle field....]
;W[oj];B[pj];W[oh];B[pi];W[jj]C[Is this sort of move correct?  My thought is I'm attacking his weak group while building a connection out for my own.

B actually has cut at O5 (followed by N5 N6), B is not weak.  Two apporaches: M7 or N13.  M7 save the cut, and next threat attack B from G8 (B M3 has only one eye).  There is not worry of B running away at R10 -- W has J14 awaiting for B R10.  And N13 weights to invade the upper more.]
;B[fp];W[ho];B[hn];W[go];B[fo];W[fq]C[I feel like I played this sequence well since f4.  I feel a little too satisfied though . . . so I wonder if I'm kidding myself.

After this move the game becomes a reading battle quickly . . . if you want go over it and offer advice, I appreciate it -- but it's simple enough I can study on my own.

Thanks a lot!];B[dn];W[fn];B[co];W[dp];B[fm];W[en];B[em];W[eo]
