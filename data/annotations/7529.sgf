AB[dd][dp][pd][pp]C[Hi Reviewer,

My name is Anton, I played white, this is my first handicap game and I am new in this go world.
At first I didnt know how or where started so I tried to cut and reduce black to the corners and own the center.

You will find some more coments forward.

Thank you very much for the review.];W[jd]C[J: Hi Anton, my name is jason and i be reviewing your game. Im a 11k player in Kgo but i haven't been actively playing for awhile now, i will try my best to give u pointers.]

;W[dj]C[I don´t know how was the begining but I think D10 is bad and with black respond (same as in the first play: K16, M17) I thought that  my strategy fail. Push black in to the corners and gain the center.

J: playing this is ok, aiming for center isn't a good plan, its hard to get good area in the center focus on the side in early game]
;B[cl];W[cn]C[J: Playing with a handicapp involves risk thus this move is acceptable.]

I faild with the left but I can see my center. If I can potect the center and atack the left y still hava a chance??

J: you might think you have a good wall on the left but that wall doesn't means forming point will be easy.]

(;W[le]C[Bad move?? N10 is too big. should I fight and own the center like I thought at first?

J: Remember Corner > Side > Center, thinking abt the corner and side b4 the center.]
;B[md];W[nf];B[gq];W[hq]C[I played badly from now and lost de low-right.
How I play this to win the low-right?
More ambitious: Do I have a chance if I play well the low part to attack low-left and win the low-right?]

;B[ml];W[on];B[pj]C[J: With this move the game is set, black hold alot of point while white dun have anything in place.]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[oi];B[nj];W[pk];B[ol];W[pl];B[nm];W[om]C[J: Black didn't take the advantage to secure more point, instead letting u get the side. as u can see so many pieces is needed jus to gain a few point towards center.]
;B[mn];W[nn];B[ln];W[jm];B[kj];W[jj]MA[kj][mj]C[Was this up-secuence a mistake (from 73 to 80)?
I lost too much center and the left was difficult. At this point I didn´t know what to do.

J: Usually we connect to the enemy unless u have allies near by, ur K10 is 2 v 1 and its black move next]

I think that it was a crucial moment but I was trying not to lose too much center and end losing the game.]

Any chance I can still win this?

J: At this point unless the opp plays badly or make a hige mistake its impossible to win, X marks the bare minimum black has thats abt 1/3 of the board already. Only chance is if u capture the triangle pieces which require black to make a few mistake.]

C[I thought i have room for two eyes. I am new and still not very good at seen if i have enough room for a play. But anyway, I try.

J: usually u can try only if the spot contain 1 or 2 isolate pieces else its impossible in a 4x3 space]

I keep playing because I am new at this and I try to learn the most of each game.
There is no need for more coments unless you see a really big mistake.
Thank you again.
