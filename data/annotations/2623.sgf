AB[pd][dp]C[
pheno : Hi, this is a game I played in the KGS Handicap Team Tournament. I managed to win by a few points, but I was black with two handicap stones and I am not satisfied by my play. I think I play many submissive moves. Usually I'm not so bad at fuseki and yose, but middle game fighting is my problem.
Reviewer:Hi, I am a go-lover with 3 or 4 handicap stones to the professional
players. Now I'll add some couple of points.]PL[W];W[po];B[dd]

pheno : I expected a solid connection for white at q6 here.
r:q6 is Joseki, however, in this situation, not bad move.];B[rm]
;W[ql];B[oo];W[pn];B[rp]C[
Now, black is leading in territory balance.
However, as white stones are so thick, it has a possibility to make a giant territory.]
;W[cf]C[
pheno : Here I think I must make a pincer. First I wanted to play c12, but I was worried about white e14 black f16 white d11, so I played high for overall balance.
R.:I agree to your thinking.];B[dh];W[ef];B[fd];W[bd];B[cc]

pheno : g14 was my aim after the kikashi on the right.

(;B[gh]LB[jf:B][jo:A]C[
pheno : too slow? this move seems a bit vague.
R.: I think A or B position is a little better than 42.  42move is slow, but steady and not so vague.

pheno : Now white is bigger than black, I must enter in the white moyo, but where is the correct entry point?…]
;B[jn]LB[jo:A]C[
I think b44 or A is a good point.];W[kp];B[jl];W[hj]C[
pheno : I'm very interested by an analysis of this fight ; I have no idea of best play after k6.
R.:I choose variation 1 or 2, however, Q6 is a good point.]

(;B[gm];W[cm]C[
pheno : how to answer?
R.: your is wright.
w49 is a bad point, for 3 black stones 
connected to the black corner stones.];B[dm];W[bn];B[dn]C[
pheno : I chose the simple way, but maybe too timid?
R.:this connection is very important and the oponent can not select a difficult move.]

56 is a wonderful tesuji.];W[ci];B[ch];W[bg];B[ck];W[bk]C[
pheno : My plan is to attack the center group.];B[ii];W[ji]
C[
pheno : Bad peep? White didn't submit…];B[jh];W[kh];B[kg]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[jc]C[
pheno : Here it is difficult, white may want to play a kind of driving tesuji with m13, so I must be careful about how to answer k17.]
;B[kc];W[kd]LB[lc:A]C[
R.:A would be the best move.]

pheno : Allowing the ponnuki is painful, so I suppose I made a bad choice.
r.:If black stone will escape (b 79) black two stones  (J16 and K16)
will be caputured by the ladder as seen in variation. the two black stones are much important than the ponnuki.]
;B[nh];W[bc];B[bb];W[bp]SQ[mp]C[
b84 is a bad move, for in this fight you became gote, sente is the most important in the final stage.
Black should choose R2 instead of Q2.
However, as now upper part(*) is open, therefore, no move is the best one in this area.]

pheno : I'm still a bit ahead so I play safety-first moves (I'm in overtime and don't want to blunder).
