C[Vacuity [2k?\]: hi have fun
Bubarik [1k\]: good luck

* Hi, I'm mafutrct, your reviewer. I'll try to point out mistakes and give useful hints in this game. My comments begin with an asterisk (*).

* I'm only KGS 2d. There's a fair chance I missed some moves or even gave wrong comments. So please just try to get the idea behind my comments and think carefully until you either accept them or prove them wrong. Questioning ideas is a great way to improve.

* Oops, after reviewing I realized it's a no komi game. So black is usually a bit better than I estimated.]

(;B[ej]C[* This looks like a natural move, but I think it is bad, actually.]
;W[di]LB[cj:B][ek:A]C[* White simply answers. Black has severe problem at A and lost most of the cut aji at B, so white is preferable.]
;B[hq]LB[ek:A][dm:B]C[i guess this was to aggressive? :)

* It's possible, but very agressive. Black has to worry about the weaknesses at A and B.]
;W[go]C[* Good move]
(;B[io]C[* This move does not make sense to me. Why this direction? Black has no moyo at the bottom (there is a white stones at Q4) and the 3 white stones are not weak. Chasing them does not create any profit.]
(;W[dm]C[* Bad move by white - attempting to cut directly helps black.]

(;W[kn]C[* White intends to sacrifice for outward influence, but I think white can do better.]

(;B[oo]LB[nc:B][qf:A][cg:C]C[* Agressive, you don't have to attack immediately.

* Instead, you can try one of A-C and leave white's weakness for later.
