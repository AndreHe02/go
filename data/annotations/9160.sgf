C[Hello, I'm Tilwen, Black in this game. I eventually won the game because of a ko he probably didn't see well, but I'm not sure I deserved to win. Anyway, all game long I had a feeling I wasn't understanding at all how the game was going. Please help me seeing what I played wrong or good, what choices I did were OK, which wre strange.
  Thank you !

Hi Tilwen, I'm Greg. If you have any questions about my review, please feel free to email me. Please take a look at my comments and variations.
I don't have too many comments on this game. For the most part, your play was fine. White was the one in trouble. There was some concern at the beginning, but thanks to a mistake on white's part, you had the upper hand for pretty much the rest of the game.]

(;B[cf]C[Greg: I don't see the point of playing this move. Just play normally on the left side. D10 is pretty comfortable for white. Both variations are better than this.]

(;B[eg]C[Greg: This is generally considered a mistake. C16 is too big for white. He takes a lot of territory with that move. You must play B17.]
;W[cd];B[gg];W[fg];B[fh];W[ff];B[ei];W[dl]
(;B[bp]C[Greg: This move is too passive and should have lead to bigger problems later, but white made a mistake. This move gives up too much influence after D6. You traded territory for incluence at the top. You must use that influence. keep white's stones separated. See variation.]
;W[dn];B[cm];W[dm];B[cq];W[jn]C[Greg: After this white should be in the lead, but white made a mistake after N3 which made the game much easier for you.]
;B[mq];W[lq];B[lp]C[Greg: I'm not so sure this is good for black. But it is hard to find a good move for white. I believe O3 makes this hard for black, but the game becomes very complicated.]

(;W[kp];B[kq];W[lo];B[lr];W[lp];B[jr]C[Greg: After this, black is in the lead significantly.]
;W[nq];B[mr];W[qf]C[Greg: I think this is another mistake on white's part. He must pincer a little closer to the R9 stone.]

;B[nr]C[Greg: At this point, I think black has a pretty good lead.]
;W[lc];B[mj]C[Greg: This is a bit of a misplay I think. The connection at M17 is more important.]
;W[ke]C[Greg: Now white threatens to make a big moyo on the top, and your right side is reduced.]
