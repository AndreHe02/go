C[This is my first game on the ASR room on KGS. I estimated my rank to be about 10-12k, but this is based on playing MFOG and past performance on KGS. I think I could have done much better than I did. A couple of things that I would like to have comments is on is (1) direction of play (especially the beginning), (2) mid-game strategy for influence, (3) general comments on play. I am black (maja), and the result of the game is W+ 27.5.

I have removed post-game comments and have added some alternative moves I thought I could have made and comments. Thank you for the time you spent on your comments. My comments are (M).

----------------------

Hi, my Name is Rainer (5k) and I did the review for your game. My comments are marked (R).
As it is a bit difficult to guess Whites goals in this teaching game, I commented as if it has been a normal game.

Regarding you points of interest:
(1) direction of play: please see my comments in the game
(2) influence: generally influence is used to attack and / or build territory. You tried to build influence in the game, but didn't use it very effectively to achieve either goal.
(3) general comments: please see my comments in the game

I hope my review helps you to develop in this wonderful game.

Best regards,

Rainer];B[dd];W[pp];B[cp];W[pd];B[nc];W[qf];B[eq]LB[nc:A]C[(R) Why do you play at A if you don't follow up?]
;W[cf];B[ch];W[cc];B[dc]LB[jc:A]C[(R) You decide to favour the upper side. It would be much better if you had a stone around A already, perhaps as a follow up to O17.]
;W[cd]
(;B[df]LB[de:A]C[(M) This may be an atypical move. I still have a long way to go to learn joseki.

(R) The peep at A is better (see variation). It is too easy for Black to break through.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[ce];B[ff];W[dg];B[ef];W[dh];B[ci];W[di];B[cj]
;W[cg];B[dl]CR[ed]LB[jd:B][fi:A]TR[dc][dd][ee][df][ef][ff]C[(M): I was conflicted here on whether to develop influence by playing somewhere like A.

(R) You already have influence on the upper side. It would be good to make use of it and build some moyo with a move around B. Your wall (triangled stones) still has a defect (circle), too.]
;W[bp];B[bq];W[lc]C[(R) Double purpose move as it attacks the lone black stone and invades the upper side.]
;B[qc];W[pc];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc];B[re];W[qe];B[qd];W[rf]
;B[sd];W[ic]C[(R) Another good move by white, as it almost nullifies the influence of the black wall and makes territory.]
;B[ie]C[(R) Black is trying to build influence towards the center by capping White, but there are still undeveloped areas on the right side and lower middle. And the black group in the upper left is still insecure.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[ec];B[fc];W[db]
(;B[qn]C[(M): my thinking here was to prevent white from developing too much on the right hand side, so I played this tenuki. Was this too hasty?

(R) I think you attacked from the wrong side (see variation).]
;W[ql]
(;B[qq]LB[on:A]C[(R) I think A would be better (see variation).]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[oq];W[nq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo]
(;B[pn]LB[on:A]C[(M): I decided to run with 59 because my invasion in the corner strengthened white too much. I wanted to have a chance at reducing his influence in the centre.

(R) The jump to A is better.];W[nn];B[mp]C[(R) This only strengthens White.]

;W[ck]
(;B[dj]LB[cl:A]C[(M): is it better to play at A?

(R) I think yes, because it would secure the corner territory.]

(;B[nj]LB[bn:A]C[(R) A move at A kills the white group.];W[bj]
;B[dn];W[cm]C[(R) Now the white group is alive.];B[iq];W[jq]
;B[en];W[em];B[fm];W[fn];B[gm]
(;W[jl];B[jj]C[(R) What is the reason for this capping stone? White can't be contained to the lower side with it and it makes no territory as the center is still open.]

;W[lf];B[kg];W[kf];B[jf];W[lg];B[lh];W[oh];B[mn]TR[hi][gj][ij]
[ik][jl][jn][jp][jq]C[(M): I decided to try to attack the marked stones ... is this a "leaning attack"?

(R) In a broad sense, yes. You try to gain momentum to attack the middle by cutting the group in half.]

(;W[lp];B[ko];W[jo];B[kp]
(;W[lq]
(;B[gi]C[(M): my opponent and I both agreed that pushing at L3 would probably have killed the group and I left the fight too early (I thought that I wouldn't be able to capture).

(R) Yes, L3 kills the white stones.];W[kq];B[hj];W[jk];B[kj]
(;W[do]LB[cq:A]C[(R) A move at A first would have been better.]

;B[er];W[fr];B[gr];W[gq];B[hr];W[es];B[cs];W[br];B[ar]C[(M): my opponent leaves the corner after this move, and I took this to mean that he thought that the black group was alive (I was afraid that it wasn't). I played out the variation and found that indeed, it is alive.]
