-- You still could have tried to do something on the left.


-- As concern reading skills I think both of you were adaquately matched. Surely the two White groups did their share in reducing Black's territory, but the game was lost by White securing her vast territory on the left. In the beginning, it is important to keep in mind that your opponent must not dominate large areas of the board. The loss of the two black stones in the upper left contributed to that. Keeping some rough count or at least impression on both players' moyos (areas of influence) will help you judge wether to play defensively (securing your territory) or to play more actively by invading or reducing your opponents count.]
