RE[W+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[To start with, I lost because my group on the upper side wasn't alive at the beginning. The Group on the upper right, and left ^^ also got me worrying.

Note: I am Black and we played nearly 3,5h. There are no time information because I appreciate Games without a time limit, it makes me nervous ;)
Also I dislike Josekis and try to get other ways to solve corner problems^^ And I play in the way Shusaku Honinbo did (at least, as far as my opponent comes along ;))

So thank you for your review, Variations with comments are prefered^^


W:

Hi, 
I think you should not "dislike" josekis, because josekis just mean equal results. What I do dislike, probably just as you, are learnt by heart josekis. Those who do that are boring. I would advise you to try and study one or two josekis closely though, (not learn, study), because once you've played them a few time, it will help improve your shapes. 

But anyways, in this fuseki, the only big problem is that you let white patch his weakness at e17, I think.

Overall in this game, you got in trouble because you helped your opponent, either by making bad shape or forcing him into good ones. (see p3)]

As white plays this kosumi, if feels like his shape is getting better, while black is overconcentrated on the left.]

A is called a broken keima, you usually want to avoid such shape (as black), as white is solidly separating black.

B is the elephant eye

C is a broken tobi

A and C are really bad shapes, B is more often acceptable. (of course there are exceptions with all those three shapes, we are playing go =)]
