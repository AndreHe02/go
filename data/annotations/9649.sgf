C[hi,
thanks a lot for reviewing my game.
I play Black.

Hi,
I'll prefix my comments and answers to your questions with two dashes "--". Hopefully they can help you!]

;B[dd]C[me: It's ok to Tenuki, right?

-- Yes, actually, I'm surprised that white didn't play at R5 to prevent you to make an enclosure. Approaching a 4-4 is worth much less. You can also play at R5 here, but that is your choice.]
;W[fc];B[id]C[me: I tried to somehow reinforce the upper right stone in case White gets sente and make a double approach? Was that ok? Could I did better?

-- Personally, I would play at J17 (a line lower) which is more threatening.]
;W[dc]C[me: Have no idea how to respond I was concerned about the crosscut. Decided avoid the tiger's mouth.

-- C17 would be a stronger move]
(;B[ed]C[-- Please see the variations];W[ec]

(;B[qd]SQ[id]C[-- You may also consider Q 17, which would be much better if squared stone is at k17 or k16]

;W[lb];B[qn]C[try to make a moyo];W[ql]
(;B[pm]C[-- See variation];W[qj];B[oh]C[was to soft?

-- No, this looks like a reasonable move to me.];W[ok];B[nl]
;W[nk];B[ml];W[ol];B[om];W[ni];B[fq]C[would be better at k3? didn't how to handle the coming invasion

-- Since your position on the bottom right is loose already, even if you play K3, it's possible to invade]
;W[jq]
(;B[dn]C[me: I tried to become stonger and get sente to attack the white stone. If did'nt respond at the coner I will invade or cover

-- Since black is pretty weak in the bottom left,  it's hard to justify creating new weak groups]
;W[eo];B[go];W[en];B[lq];W[hq]
(;B[ip]C[-- This move makes white do what it wants to do....to make an eye.]
;W[hp]C[me: the variation was better?

-- Personally, I think the variation is too passive...and the result isn't great, either. Perhaps you can play J4 (see variation)]

(;B[ho];W[iq];B[fp]C[me: I think this was too heavy. what would be better?

-- Personally, J4 at this point];W[jp];B[hm];W[io]C[-- Don't let white make easy eyes! Now white is pretty much alive]

;B[ng]C[me: I thought I could be cut. I coldn't right? What to do insted?

(;B[bc]C[me: should had invade the side instead? It became very big later...

last commentary.
