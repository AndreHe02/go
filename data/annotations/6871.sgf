C[Thanks for taking the time out to review this game for me.I am the person who plays white(masterlcm). I have gone over the game once angain and I know I am not strong enough. Would you mind to give suggestions on moves where you think a bigger extension would be better or a better move gobally would be better? Also, could you point out which move is a crude style? I would appreciate any advice to improving my game.

mentat> Yes, I'll do my best!

In this review I tried to point out the mistakes I could see in the fuseki.

You need to work on tsumego. In my opinion It seems that you are too afraid when agressive play is urgent. This has affected your whole game.

It was hard to do this review because you have not explained your questions during the game. For the next games you submit to GTL, I recomend you to comment the parts of the game that got you confused.]

(;W[dj];B[fc]C[mentat> black should consider to play in the bottom right corner.]

(;W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[ic]C[mentat> B is too low. W is too thin.

W will need to exploit B's top. And me must be aware of possible invasions in the left side.]
