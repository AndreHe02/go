;B[pp]C[This game was played on KGS. I realized from the outset that my opponent was much stronger than me. I had never encountered this type of opening before and somehow his large moyo based around G13 just appeared. I never got anywhere near challenging it.
I am a beginner and tho KGS gave me 21k after this game, it will soon revert to a more realistic 30k

K:  Hello :)  I'm Kevin, and I'm the reviewer the GTL has assigned to your game.  I've prefaced my comments throughout with "K".]
;W[pd];B[dd];W[dq];B[cf];W[co];B[nc];W[pf]C[K:  You could probably get away with extending this another line (to Q13), but the one-point jump is a nice, safe play.]
;B[pc];W[qc];B[pb];W[qb];B[mq];W[jq];B[kq];W[jo];B[od];W[pe]
C[;];B[oe]C[I was trying to protect my RHS and only now realize that he was building a powerful inside wall

K:  Under the circumstances, you didn't have much choice.  The exchange from Black 17 to 19 was a natural progression.]
;W[pi]C[K:  You could also have played this at P12, a knight's move, in order to come out a little farther.  Though since you're on the fourth line already, much outward expansion leaves you open below.]
;B[jd];W[dj]C[Whilst uncertain, i was not particularly worried as yet - i was thinking of a framework centred on G7

K:  When you're looking at an area that large for your space, resolve in your mind that you almost certainly won't get all of it.  As a corollary, don't get too caught up in a particular plan you have--pursue it as long as it's viable, but they say no battle plan survives contact with the enemy, and when circustances change you must adapt your course of action as well.]
;B[ci];W[cj];B[di];W[ej];B[fr]C[This upset me and i did not know how to respond to an invasion.

K:  The first thing is that because of the opening beneath your K3 stone, Black can almost certainly connect underneath.  Normally he would probably not try to make a group in a space this small, but because he is confident of being able to link back to his other group, he plays this move.

How you play this battle comes down to a matter of where you want to take the hit.  You can play K2 before he does, but this will cause Black to either extend upward from his stone, or possibly move someplace like D2 or C2 in an attempt to make life in the corner.

I personally would play either F3 or, perhaps better, G3.  This serves two purposes:  For one, it puts the squeeze on Black to make life along the side, probably connecting with his outside group, and two, in this particular set of circumstances it advances the space that you want.  I've included a few moves that might result from such play (see variation).]

(;W[hq]C[so i tried this, intending F4 next

K:  F4 might have been a good play for the previous move.  Unfortunately, if there is an urgent action that requires two moves, your opponent will rarely allow you both chances you need--in a situation like this, you need to determine what is the best response with one move.  (Which is, I'm afraid, a skill which can be learned only through practice.)]
;B[fp]C[but he played it first

K:  Proverbial:  "Your opponent's best move is often your best move."]
;W[go];B[fo];W[fn]C[i played the next sequence of moves badly, and despite the silly mistake, i just did not have any plan, except for trying to stop him escaping and cutting down his potential eye space

K:  Again, you're not likely to be able to kill this group.  What I see is potential space for you to the left and potential influence to the right.  The moyo you were thinking of is now going to have to take a strong line along 6 if anywhere.]
;B[gp];W[gn];B[hp];W[ip];B[hr];W[gq]C[K:  This move is much too small (that is, not of enough value) to be making right now.  You should be concentrating on cordoning off what remains of the left-hand space; a move like E5 could be very good at this time.]
;B[fq];W[gr];B[gs];W[ir]C[thinking of my own attack and ignoring his moves..should have been J3 i suppose

K:  Under the circumstances.  But pushing a situation like that is really only a good idea if you have a threat that arises from it.  Otherwise you simply end in gote (that is, playing defensively--as opposed to "sente", or having the initiatve.)]
;B[iq];W[hq];B[gq];W[iq]C[K:  Again, this is a small play.  Yes, he could take H3 otherwise, but it's a very small sacrifice--especially because a play at L2 would effectively secure the other stones if he did.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[pm]C[Was i right to shift the focus? My aim was to try and get more territory on the RHS as i could not see how i could gain anything around E4 area

K:  You can gain in a fight by keeping your opponent from gaining.  Although you weren't far off with this move, I would still recommend cutting off Black's inroad into your territory with E5 or E6.  If Black plays at E6 right now, you'd be hard-pressed to stop him from advancing into the space above--which you want as your territory.]
;B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[nm];B[ln];W[km]C[Looking for a framework centred upon G8

K:  Again, you're attaching too much to plans that are too grandiose.  Right now you should be thinking more about using things like your Q14 or Q11 stones to leap out into the center, which would not only begin to challenge Black's nascent topside moyo, but help build up your right-side territory as well.]
;B[kn];W[jn];B[mm];W[mk]C[this was aimed at
a) building shape on RHS and
b) the G8 moyo plan

K:  Ah, but you've allowed Black an inroad at M8, which he takes at the next opportunity.

You'll run into this situation a lot--if you've ever got a space (usually between two stones just like this) where the opponent can kosumi (play diagonally) between the stones and you can't block him on both sides, he'll be able to escape and start wreaking havoc.

Let me add, though, that White 60 as it stands is actually a good move--you were just trying to use it to the wrong effect.  What this stone does is begin to seriously beef up your territorial claims on the right-hand side, and provide a strong path into the center.  What it does not do is significantly strengthen your left-hand space, and trying to connect it to that area is futile once Black gets going.]
;B[ll];W[kl];B[lk]C[K:  As I stated, a common situation.  Learn to avoid it if possible and how best to deal with it when it occurs.]
;W[nj]C[following 2 tracks still ; RHS and G8

K:  Good idea.  This move would have been slightly better at N10, one point to the left.  As it is, Black can play N10 instead and start putting the pressure on your stones here.]
;B[jk]C[but G8 plan is crumbling and now, in hindsight, i can see his framework taking shape

K:  Yep.  Scale back your own dreams and start looking at how to crush his--specifically, you've still got one last chance to get into his moyo before it completely forms.  Leap from your growing right-side influence to someplace like, say, N13 or M12.  At this point, I doubt you could reduce his space enough to win the game with this tactic, but you could make the margin a little narrower.]
;W[jl]C[K:  Too small.  If you're going to use this move to advance your territorial claim on the left, use it someplace like...G8.]
;B[im]C[35 moves in 8 minutes is very fast for me and perhaps i should have slowed down..but i just followed his pace. With this attack i abandoned my G8 moyo hopes and for next moves concentrated upon connecting stones and trying to ensure i had 2 eye spaces in the mix

K:  Try not to let your opponent's pace dictate yours--it's tough, but it will benefit you greatly to play only when you're ready.

Also, 20 minutes is a pretty tight space to play a game in, especially for a novice.  Most games at this level, when they're timed, are closer to 30 minutes per side for a nice, round hour.  It's just 10 more minutes, but you can really feel the difference.  But if you can find someone who will play with you with no time limit, so you don't have that extra factor weighing on your mind as you try to decide what to do, that may be best at first.]
;W[ho];B[il];W[jm]C[K:  Those three stones--a total of six points for Black if he captures them--are pretty insignificant compared to some of the other moves on this board.  The pieces you saved don't contribute to your formation, nor do they represent a particular threat to Black by their existence.  My advice would be to abandon them and do something like working to secure your own moyo or jumping into Black's still-unprotected center territory the way I mentioned earlier.  Both moves are worth more than six points in the long run.]
;B[in];W[io];B[kk];W[gl]C[reduced ambition.. smaller moyo on D7

K:  Good plan.  This is even starting to look like you might be able to secure it without Black making further incursions.]
;B[hk];W[fk]C[K:  This one could have come up at G9 to squeeze a little tiny extra out of the space.  Chances are that the moves would proceed Black G10, White F10, and you would end in gote, but since you do anyway, you manage a little bit more with the alternate sequence.]
;B[gj];W[eo]C[whereas his large moyo around H14 has already decided the game i suspect

K:  Black still has space on the upper side that could be open enough for an invasion, and of course, the right side of his moyo is still wide open.  Again, however, most of what you can do to it probably won't cut it down enough to win the game.]
;B[ep];W[do];B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[br];B[es];W[is];B[hs]C[I had noticed that this B F3 group was tight and hence was hoping to play H1 myself to reduce his eyes.. and perhaps gain a prize!

K:  Nope--even if you'd managed to come in on H1, he would have had his eye.  (e.g., wH1, bG2, wC1, bD1.)]
;W[kr];B[lq];W[lr];B[mr];W[ls]C[K:  Another set of fairly small moves.  He did have to respond, but you ended in gote and didn't gain much by it.]
;B[oh]C[K:  Now Black is simultaneously solidifying the only remaining entrance to his moyo and threatening your space.]
;W[ph]C[I knew i had lost but played on for a bit];B[oi];W[oj]
;B[mj];W[nk];B[mi];W[ml];B[lm];W[pn];B[po];W[qo];B[qp];W[rp]
;B[rq];W[ro];B[fj];W[ek]C[K:  Closing the other side of a kosumi is a knee-jerk reaction for most beginners, and it's a good instinct to have.  However, in cases like this, it's not quite necessary.  You might have tried filling at G9 instead, which would also have solidified E9.  Even if you'd left it, however, a black cut at E9 would have been ineffective as you have a ladder.  (Of course, if Black managed to fill both F10 and G9, you would be obliged to respond.)]
;B[ei];W[bi];B[bh];W[ai];B[bs];W[ar];B[cs];W[of]C[just in case i could wriggle into the upper centre

K:  Not enough to do any good, given the reinforcement this area has undergone.  Now that Black has the huge upper-center area, he really doesn't have to do much--just play a nice, conservative game and make sure you can't, for example, sneak into his moyo from the side.]
;B[nf];W[og];B[ng];W[gk];B[ah]C[
and everything is over..i made a couple of more errors letting him capture AB 2 & 11

K:  Another situation you'll learn to recognize is this one--those two stones seem so safe, but the cutting point means that you can't capture a cutting stone quickly enough to keep him from capturing your pieces.

For what it's worth, there are two possible responses to this situation.  One is the obvious guarding of the cutting point with a play like B9 or B10.  The other possibility is to leave it be.  It sounds a little odd, perhaps, but if there's something else very important on the board, you may decide to make that play.  When the opponent cuts, you put him in atari and force him to capture, then seal him off.  You do sacrifice some points, but it may not be as many as another important play on the board.  (Usually it's best just to guard the cutting pont, though--I mention the second situation more for reference than anything else.)]
;W[pa]C[
should have played B10

K:  Or someplace like F17.  Or even C17--the 3-3 invasion is very difficult to defeat when it comes under a star point stone.]
;B[oa];W[qa];B[nb];W[sq];B[rr];W[sr];B[rs];W[ms];B[or];W[nr]
;B[nq];W[ns];B[os];W[ni];B[nh];W[hm]C[K:  You've actually done a good thing to this point--namely, making moves in sente.  Although the cutting point at B10 is still open, Black can't take advantage of it if you're constantly forcing him to respond to your moves.]
;B[hl];W[hn];B[bj]C[
i should have noticed these threats earlier and played B10 and B3 much earlier instead of those other cosmetic moves]
;W[ak]C[K:  Bad call--you're not forcing him to capture here.  This should be at B9 to minimize damange, and in fact if Black were feeling malicious, he could play B9 himself.  Although you could perhaps run your A9 stone along with more moves and eventually connect at A2, Black would have amassed a huge amount of influence in your territory before he had to capture the two stones to keep connected.  From there, he probably could have ripped up most of the space in this corner.]
;B[aj];W[bk];B[as];W[ck]C[K:  Because you could reply to a C9 cut with C8 (continuing bD9 wD8! if he forced the issue), this move is unnecessary and should be at B3 or B4, protecting the cut.]
;B[bq];W[bp]C[K:  The proper response.];B[aq];W[ap];B[kp];W[bo]
C[K:  Again unnecessary, to say nothing of creating an unpleasantly thick shape.]
;B[ko];W[jp]C[K:  Also not necessary, since neither you nor your opponent can gain anything by playing here.

(Incidentally--points that can never belong to either side are known as dame (dah-may), and occasionally you will see players take turns filling them at the end of the game before passing.  There's nothing wrong with this, although a computer program will automatically exclude the dame, and on a real board they are filled after the game is over anyway.  In this instance, I'm pointing to filling the dame as a mistake because it gains you absolutely nothing, while there are other points on the board that could get you something.

Trying not to get too much on a tangent here, but also note that sometimes, filling dame during play can be a strategy--often it can be used to put pressure on your opponent.)]

K:  From what I can see with this game, you've got the makings of a solid Go player.  Your opening was actually very tight--it was once the infighting began that you started to fall apart.  Learning the tricks of close battles is something you'll pick up with more games.

A particular bit of advice--don't attach to any given possibility that you see.  Just because an area may become your territory, or you have your eye on it, doesn't mean that it will; meanwhile, focusing too much on one thing that you're doing gives the opponent too much time to develop what he's doing unimpeded.

I suspect that with a bit more playing, you'll begin to be able to see trouble before it's suddenly knocking at your door.  Of course, by that point, you'll have completely new problems to think about :)

Good luck!  And thanks for the chance to review this game.  It was a lot of fun.]

;W[gp]C[K:  Although Black still has a threatening presence in your space, his groups are weakened, and both will probably have to find eyes on their own.

Note that in this board position, the two black stones on the top of your formation (F5 and E4) are probably the more dangerous.  In fact, carefully played, the black group below may be dead, whereas the tone above have a lot of open space to work with even in the utter absence of a base.]
