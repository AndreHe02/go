AB[jd][dj]C[Hi ... Thanx for the time you gonna spend on this review
----------------------------------
Emurga, in order to win this game you  needed to play more aggressively. Both in the simple moves, as well as in your large scale game plan. I hope that by reviewing the game you can learn some basic tactics, as well as understand how to judge your stone's strength in various situations.]

(;B[ik]C[I wonder if K3 was not better ... openning to lower border
was my idea at that time
-----------------------------
K3 is definitely a better move. It wraps up white's stone on the outside fo the board, and secures your other two stones. See variation.]
;W[ki];B[jh];W[kg];B[jf];W[kc]
(;B[ic]C[Like with J3, this move is incorrect. It let's white off too easily, watch what happens when you fight back in the variation.]
;W[ke];B[kd];W[ld]C[While you made mistakes to get to this point, the game is not lost. Many beginners might look at this situation, see that white has territory on the whole right side, and assume that black is behind. But white's stones are on the third line, and at best can only secure about 20 points on the right side. 

There is a go proverb:
The fourth line is the line of victory

And black is on the fourth line! The key is to not think about go as only about securing territory. Here black has what would be called a wall. His stones are strong and well connected. What he wants to do is attack white, and use this strength to corner white. If he does this, he can win the game.]
(;B[cg]C[This move is too timid, I would move it up a line (see variation). It's important to be aggressive here to take advantage of your wall.]

-----------------
Your move at D6 is pressing (see variation), and D9 does not seem to have any clear benefits to me (see other variation).]

----------------------
Yes there is (see variation).];C[White: 41 territories + 0 prisoner + 0.5 komi = 41.5
Black: 39 territories + 0 prisoner = 39
Result: W+2.5


Thanx again

I hope the review can help. If I missed any points of interest, feel free to email me (makubesu@gmail.com) and let me know. I'm sure you'll improve quickly!]
