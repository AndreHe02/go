C[Hi, thank you for taking the time to review this game. This is a San ren sei moyo game which is the typical kind of game I'm trying to learn and practice. It didn't end well in this game despite a decent start and I'd like to understand which mistakes I did make.

H Guillaume.
I can't see how strong you are from the game record so I'll let you know I am 1d on KGS.
Interesting game. I prefaced my comments with P: when on the same page as yours.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Paul];B[pd];W[cd];B[pp];W[dq];B[pj];W[nq];B[pn];W[no]
(;B[ed]C[I think white's move was a good way to limit the moyo. I tried the approach move to build on the right side.

P: This is of course a big point.];W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[cf]
;B[jd];W[ki]LB[lc:D][nc:C][qf:A][qh:B]C[This is a really nice point to reduce your moyo but there are so many large points on the sides that it feels premature to me. I would look to play first in the corners then on the sides and finally in the center.

As white I would aim at one of the A-D points instead of this one.]
(;B[fh]TR[cf]C[In response to White's invasion, I worked towards building up the framework.

P: I would be reluctant to play in this area for several reasons:
The marked white stone is very strong so your move doesn't really do any work in that direction.
The K16 stone is a perfect distance from the F-line wall so this move overlaps that position and becomes a little bit overcentrated there.
There are big moves at C5, D5, K4, O16 and Q14 which I think are more urgent.
This stone is three spaces from the stones at E16-F16. That would be fine on the third line but in the center is is a little bit thin in regards to future fighting.]
;W[ci]TR[cf]C[Here I think white played too close to the marked stone himself.]
(;B[mm]C[Was this move well placed? The ogeima seems thin as there are white stones around.

P: I normally see black play at O7. The problem with this is a weakness at O7 (see variation).]
(;W[jp]C[Now the position comes more into balance. The L11 stone is a little far into the black framework but the N7stone is thin being too far from Q6. The option to put white off balance has passed.]
;B[km]LB[nd:A][pf:B][do:C]C[This move strengthens the N7 stone and is good in that regard. In the direction of the bottom however it isn't doing much work. I would be inclined to play around one of the marked points somewhere.

I think it is important to note that a moyo strategy is built on a foundation of the sides. It is not about taking the center. If white gets a living and stable base on one of the sides you don't have a moyo so much as just a bunch of center territory.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[kc];B[jc];W[jb];B[kd]C[Was it a good choice in direction? I wanted to build from the direction of the moyo and separate the potential supporting stone in the center.

P: I think it will be hard to take the center due to the O16 stone. I would have preferred to see you to occupy O17 first making territory directly.]
;W[lb];B[lc];W[kb];B[ld];W[ic]
(;B[mb];W[nb];B[mc];W[ma]TR[nd]C[This approach leaves white with less eye space but also leaves your UR corner more exposed.

I don't see how you will kill white's group as it has room to run in the center from the marked stone or connect underneath.]
;B[hb];W[ib];B[id];W[hc];B[gb]C[I think this is biting off more than you can chew.

White can cut you into two groups and should be able to live. That leaves you with less in the center than you had hoped.]
;W[hd]TR[ed][fd][fh]C[Now I think this is a very interesting position with regard to middle game fighting.

Let's look at your objectives here:
The marked black stones are thin and you don't want white to separate them.
The upper center black group is becoming surrounded.

I think that in these sort of positions (i.e. fights in areas where you have more stones) it is a good idea not to make touching moves. You certainly don't want to be put in a position where you need to make a move to strengthen one of your groups that hurts another one.

A quick note here. There is a sequence in the upper left that you can use to your advantage.]
(;B[he]LB[kg:A]C[This is an example of a move that aids the top center group but hurts the UL group. If I wanted to help the top center I would have just played at A.]
;W[ge];B[hf];W[gf];B[gg];W[gd];B[ef];W[eg]TR[fh]C[Now we are seeing the weakness in the three space extension to delta.]
;B[dg];W[ff];B[eh]C[At this stage, I chose to give up 7 stones and build up a wall in the process. Despite the thickness, I feel dissatisfied. Am I wrong? What should I have done better in this sequence from move 39?]
;W[ee];B[fg];W[de]C[The game has turned in white's favor.

He has about 40 points in the UL, another 10 on the bottom and a handfull in the LL corner.
Black has almost no territory in the center and a cutting point at H13 to worry about.
The UR corner is open.
There is a weakness at O7.
He may have 20 points on the right side.];B[mf]C[I had to close the moyo at that stage.

P: Yes, this should be interesting.]
(;W[ne];B[nf]C[This is a VERY NICE exchange for you. The white move is on dame while your move occupies a critical point.]
;W[qc];B[ob]C[I played to separate. Was this move a correct choice in this situation?]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[qd];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[se];B[oa];W[na]
(;B[ra];W[pc]C[A very bad move for white. This doesn't hurt you. However later on instead he could have played P16 forcing you to play here and then followed up with P14. It doesn't do much now but that sequence, or a move to threaten it, could make a difference in the center fighting in the future.]
;B[od];W[rb];B[qa];W[rd];B[sc]C[Save this for later. A good ko threat.]
;W[sb];B[dj]C[Tried the shoulder hit to continue to build the moyo.]
;W[ij]C[White refused to obey and chose to give his lone stone in the center a chance.]
(;B[ih]LB[hg:A]TR[nf][dj]C[I tried to play so to both attack and defend the cutting point at A?

P: I don't know if you have time for this now.
Of course I pointed out the cut earlier as a problem but things have changed.

You got in the two marked moves. These strengthen your groups a lot and you might be able to attack more violently.]

(;B[lj];W[lk];B[kj];W[jk]
(;B[im];W[gj]
(;B[hi]LB[hk:A][gm:B]C[I think this move wasn't a good choice. Playing from the weak side at A or B may have been a better option. What would you recommend in this fight?

P: You are correct. See variation.];W[hk];B[gm];W[ej]

;W[rn]C[What is the best answer to this sliding move?];B[ro]
C[I was very surprised that White didn't chose to make a base rather than build up in the corner.]
;W[qo];B[rm];W[rp];B[qn];W[so];B[rk];W[po];B[dl]C[I thought I had a winning game at that stage.]

;W[ll];B[mo];W[jn]LB[jm:A][jo:B]C[This is, in my opinion, the turning of the game. Faced with this connection issue, I did hesitate between A and B (tesuji?). What would have been the best choice?

P: Back to move 121. The rest is very difficult fighting.]

(;W[gr]C[And provoking this move is bad as it might come to the aid of the K4 stone later on.]
;B[ln];W[ko]
(;B[mq];W[mn];B[jq]C[This was a bad choice for the ko but I couldn't think of any other threats. I've got a few questions there :
1. Was the ko the best choice?
2. Were the hane and the hanging connection I choose to play the best move in this situation?
3. Which would have been my best choice for a ko threat in this situation?

P: The ko was probably the best you had but it didn't work. See earlier comments.
At this point the game is over.];W[mp];B[hr]C[It looks difficult to live here.]

;W[gs];B[is];W[jr]C[Black died sadly. This is game over. What could have been done to save this group? I was in bio-yomi at that time and the rest of the game is most likely not worth reviewing.
I'm really looking forward to your comments and learning from my mistakes. Thank you again for your time.]

Since you have closed off the right side with S13 (and can play T13 in sente) you get about 30 points there.]

))
(;B[jp]C[Again, I would just play like this.

It is true that white seems to have thwarted black's plan to build a grand moyo. However, it has cost him dearly. It is difficult to see how the three white stones on the right side of the board will make any territory and I think black is pulling ahead. Just the threat of a moyo has served to give black a lead.]

(;B[jp]C[I still like this. It is difficult to see how white is going to make much territory from his three right side stones while all yours are nicely placed.]
)
(;B[eg]LB[cg:A][ch:B]C[If I were to play around here it would be at this point. The idea is to build the moyo to the right and threaten a move like A or B to lock the white corner group out of the game.

Note that this is two spaces from your 16-line stones.]))
(;B[jp]LB[nm:A][mp:B]C[I think white's move is a little thin. 

If you occupy a point on the bottom side his stones are left without a base. 

You can then aim at A or B to attack him. It will be difficult for him to make any territory with this group and I would say you are ahead at this point.

This may seem to be a shift from your plan of making a large framework with the san-ren-sei but I think white has handed you a guift here and you shouldn't hesitate to alter your plan to take advantage of it.]
