C[Dear reviewer. My name is Biondy 15 k player in IGS.

This is my game against 6k player. I've played my best but I'm still lose by 25.5 points.

I hope you can help me with this game.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]
;B[qn];W[dj];B[fc]C[Is this ok or better to approach from the bottom board

Carey: I think an approach from the bottom would be better.  It puts your shimari in the bottom right to good use.  It would make it harder for white to pincher your approaching stone.]
;W[hc];B[fe];W[df];B[ie]C[Actually my hand slipped here and I misclick. but I think it's quite ok]
;W[jc];B[nc];W[ke];B[jd]LB[db:A][hd:B][fg:C]TR[cc]C[Bad move.

I think this move only strenghtening white

Carey: Correct.  It's also gote, which means that you have to go back and protect H15.  At this point, I would be more concerned about eye space for your own group.  He's already got eye space for his.  I think any one of these moves would of been preferable.  'A' would also likely be sente because white would respond at C17]
;W[kd];B[he]
(;W[kb]LB[kc:A][lc:B]C[Carey: White did not need to protect here.  Even if he did, he should of played at 'A' or 'B'.  This way leaves a nice peep for black at 'B'.  See variation.]
;B[qg];W[dc]C[I don't really understand. I think white should play somewhere else than defending corner

Carey: This definitively takes the corner, but yes, it is a slower move]
;B[ig];W[ne];B[od];W[of];B[pf]LB[oh:A][pi:B]C[Carey: This move looks unnecessary to me.  I would try to push his escaping group in a way that works well with your other stones (i.e. your shimari)]

;W[fd];B[ed];W[ec];B[ee];W[de];B[je]C[Carey: This is a wasted move.  Black should of made a big play move here in the bottom.]
;W[jf];B[jg];W[kh]
(;B[if]C[Carey: This is also a wasted move.  White could not of done anything.]
;W[kf]C[Carey: This was also a wasted move by white.  Black capturing that stone would of been much smaller than anywhere else white could of played.]

(;B[fg]LB[eh:A][fi:B]C[Carey: Slow move.  A or B is better.]
;W[eh];B[eg];W[dg];B[fh];W[ei];B[me]LB[cn:A][jq:B]C[I think I must attacking white moyo here, but later this move  only wasted move

Carey: That is a very very small moyo to attack.  White has much bigger, weaker moyo on the left side (A).  Also now would be good time to extend from your shimari and make some profit (B).]
;W[mf];B[md];W[lf];B[pg]C[Carey: This move helps white.  He is more than happy to make a full triangle while you take an empty one.]
;W[oh];B[mi]C[Attacking the moyo again, but now I think this move is pretty bad.

Ii think I must support my group somewhere else before playing here.

Carey: This is not really moyo at this point.  I would ignore that area altogether.  It's very hard to make territory in the center (but he was able to with your help).  Don't forget one of the very basic rules of go: Corners first, then sides, then center.  

Right now, both players are ignoring this rule to spend many many moves in the center to make or take away a small amount of territory when they could of spent just one or two moves to make territory on the sides and corners.]
;W[kj];B[ik];W[oj];B[pk];W[pi];B[qi];W[ok];B[mk];W[jj];B[ij]
;W[om];B[pl];W[ol]C[Carey: White is trying to gobble up the stones on a large scale rather than attack them directly, and doing a good job.]
;B[ll];W[jl];B[ln];W[po];B[mp]C[I think I must save my group. But as exchange, my group is divided. But I think it's ok.

Carey: I don't see any groups of yours in serious danger right now.]

(;B[jp]LB[fp:B][fq:A]C[Carey: Slow Move.  Play bigger at A or B.  No need to protect the cut, it's not cuttable (see variation)]
;W[kl]C[Carey: I would of ignored this move to play bigger.]

(;B[lk];W[fq]C[Carey: As you can see, he's happy you responded so he could take the bigger points.]
;B[hq];W[hr];B[ir];W[gr]
(;B[iq]LB[hp:A]C[Carey: If you're going to defend a cutting point, play bigger at "A"]
;W[co]C[Carey: This is a slow move.  I don't think 3-3 point is invadable because of F3 and G2]
;B[fl]C[I think I can make moyo here, but...];W[gj]C[This move destroy my connection

Carey: With G9, you are connected]

;W[gn];B[ho];W[fp];B[hs];W[fr];B[is]LB[hd:C][ni:A][mn:B]C[Carey: 0 points in gote here.  This is a bad endgame move.  You are going to have to play here eventually, so you might as well wait until white forced you to.  Right now you really need to be looking for forcing moves on white that also make territory for you or reduce territory for him.

See Peep at 'A', or atari at 'B' or 'C'];W[lb]C[Carey: So he took a point that you have to respond to.]

C[I hope you can help me here.

I know that I'm losing very big and there is nowhere to turn the table around. This is the last thing I could try.

Carey: If white plays right, there is no way black can live here.  If you want to try something, you should do it before he gets a hard wall there.  They call this endgame for a reason.  It's over :)]

I think my game is very good remember the difference between us (eventhough I don't think my opponent is very though)

Can you please help me? especially the opening that white did (three hoshi)

I only ask above, but don't hesitate to tell me more

Thanks in advance

Carey: White taking three hoshi in the beginning is not that big of a deal.  He's basically saying that he wants to play a big moyo game.  If you're good at attacking, you can foil his plot by black inside the moyo and trying to live.  But of course, the more peaceful option is to just make big moyo yourself!  Remember that white is going to be just as afraid of a black hoshi as you are of him.

You shouldn't be afraid of moyo, but you shouldn't let it go either.  When it looks like your opponent is getting a large chunk of the board, make sure to 1) take a large chunk yourself or 2) reduce his moyo by trying to live inside of it, or forcing him into a lower shaper.  It all comes down town how peaceful of a game you want.  I, personally, like to fight, so I'll jump right in.

And you're right, your opponent was not 6k, not even close.  I would estimate he was 2 stones stronger than you.]
