C[NiceMarmot [9k\]: hello gg
yellowkgs [9k\]: Hi, gg too

Hi, I am Joachim, yellowkgs, playing black. Thanks for your review!

Hi! I'm David, aka SolarBear, and I'll be doing the review. I know the review is for Black but I'll include some comments about White moves in the off chance that someone else ever reads this review. ;)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[qf];W[qe]
(;B[pi]C[Joachim: Here, I experimented with a thinner move than the standard Q14. Is that ok?

David : Generally speaking, not answering a contact play can result in problems. See variation on this move and the next one.]

(;W[cn];B[fp];W[dk]MA[dj]C[David : The joseki move is to play at D10 unless some particular situation arises.]
;B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[df]MA[dj]C[David : With this move, we see that D9 really should have been at D10 : White's stones would link more easily together.]
;B[jc];W[lc]
(;B[nd]C[Joachim: Was this too early? Better O3?

David : Yes! No point in reducing when you can invade.];W[nc]
;B[ld];W[oc]
(;B[nq]C[Black, if he's going to reduce White, better do it completely before playing elsewhere. See variations.]
;W[qn];B[ql]
(;W[pn]C[David : Very slow, playing the one space jump would be just as solid, in this situation, and much faster.]
;B[mo];W[om];B[qp]C[Joachim: Here, I was happy to have a group to chase.]
;W[jp]
(;B[iq]C[David : Don't play contact moves to attack. See variation.]
;W[kq];B[mm]C[Joachim: A better player would probaly have made more profit out of the two weak white groups, but I failed to do that. Could you guide me how to improve my play?

David : Backtrack to Black 29 to read some variations I provided. You had the right idea with this move, though!

Keep in mind, also, that since Black did not answer White 30, he can still invade the lower left for big damage...]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[nk]
(;B[dm]C[David : Use this kind of move to reduce White. Here, it actually helps White to strengthen his stones and claim territory both in the corner and the side. This makes an invasion on the right much less likely to succeed.
See var.];W[cm];B[dn];W[bp]
(;B[jn]C[Joachim: Was this the wrong side? Should I better hve played J4 with the intention to make territory on the lower right side?

David : Let's see... (see vars)];W[io];B[hp];W[in];B[jm];W[hm]

(;B[dl]C[David : Headbutting against a stone is bad. See var.]
;W[ck]C[David : This kind of move should make alarms ring in your head. "White is trying to stop me from invading!"]
;B[cl];W[bl];B[ek];W[hk];B[re];W[rd];B[lk]
(;W[mj]
(;B[lr]C[David : Not bad, per se (it does stop White to make an eye by playing, say, N3) but Black still needs one more move..]
;W[lj];B[jk];W[go]C[Joachim: Here, I thought: shoudl I try connecting at the bottom or continue to split with K11. I was also a bit frustrated that my chasing of the two groups did not lead to territory

David : First, I'll begin with a general rule of mine : when you attack a group and end up with a weak position, it certainly means you've overstretched yourself.  One needs to learn to stop attacking and take some profit, even if it means playing a gote move.

Also, one of the problem here is the absolutely huge left side Black still hasn't tried to invade or reduce. This makes Black's profit seem quite poor in comparison.]

(;B[jq]C[David : Bad. Black is forcing White to connect, ie. do precisely what he'd like to do. See vars for ideas.]
;W[lp];B[kr];W[mp]
(;B[on]C[David : This felt weird... See variations on the few next moves. If it weren't for White's mistake, this could have been terrible.]
;W[nn];B[oo]
(;W[mn]C[David : What if White was not so kind to Black? See var.]
;B[nm];W[pl]
(;B[ln]C[David : Small and, quite possibly, a game-losing move (see next move).]
;W[pj]C[David : This is one of the moves that hurt Black the most! You asked why you felt you did not get much in return for attacking? Remember I told you you need to learn to stop attacking?

Black's position on the right was already weak : the fighting that happened in the previous moves weakened it further. Here, White is simply cashing in.]
;B[pe];W[qd];B[pf]C[David : A wise choice.];W[od];B[ne];W[kd]
;B[kc];W[md];B[le];W[me];B[mf];W[mc]

;W[qk];B[rj];W[rk];B[lf];W[oe];B[of];W[ii];B[je];W[jj]
(;B[ed]MA[cc]C[David : By playing this move, Black helps White remove his weakness at C17.]
;W[dc];B[np];W[lo];B[cq]C[David : Invading or reducing White's left side is much more urgent than defending the corner.]
;W[bq];B[ej]C[David : Black is forcing White to defend his side!]

;W[ik];B[jh];W[hh];B[hg];W[gh];B[ca]C[Joachim: Was that the best, I could do to reduce the white corner?

David : The sequence where Black invades at the 3-3 point, at B 93, is bigger. However, in this situation, it's pretty much the best that Black can manage.]
;W[bb];B[cb];W[cc];B[kb]MA[ca][cb]C[Joachim: I misread the top left corner, I should have played E19 or something similar.

David : Indeed, White can now cut the C19 stones.];W[lb];B[gg]
;W[db];B[ro]C[I left the top left corner for possible ko threats, is that good thinking?

David : In this situation, yes. B19 is a great ko threat, followed by D19 afterwards. The order is important!]

yellowkgs [10k\]: yes, I enyoyed the game very much


Joachim: Dear reviewer, you may also leave some more general comments. Thanks for taking the time!

David : So, what made you lose the game?

1) Endgame mistakes (that failed monkey jump in the top left, White's invasion of the bottom left, etc.) I won't cover these, you noticed them yourself!

2) Call it "restraint". Attacking groups is fine - it is one of the most fun things in go, isn't it? - but if you're leaving weak groups behind it certainly will come back and slap you in the face. Be constantly aware of the weaknesses you leave behind and when you're overstretching yourself, come back and patch your weaknesses. This is especially important if your opponent is leaning on your own groups to gain strength and liberties.

3) The biggest mistake I saw was leaving White the whole left side without trying to invade or reduce it. The sequence at B45 and B93 remove any hope for any kind of serious action against the left side : White barely needed to defend it! It was an easy target since W 10 was on the 4th line and 1 line further from the corner stone than the usual joseki : having only 4th line stones, it was easy to invade. An invasion there could easily have given you the 20 points you needed to win.

Okay, I think that's enough! If you have any questions, make sure to mail me! (solarbear AT gmail DAWT com) See you!]
