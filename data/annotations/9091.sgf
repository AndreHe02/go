C[Hello, thanks for doing this review!  I played this game on DGS as white, and I feel like I may have played some slow moves that lost me this game.  Was there anything I could have done in the endgame to get those points back?

Thanks!


Hey Dmitriy,
I'm Max, a 6kyu from Hameln, Germany.

I'll prefix all my comments in the main game line with "Max-" and try to address all the questions you added.

I'll also give a summary of the review at the end of the game.

Enjoy!];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[oq];W[co]TR[ck][dk]C[D: Was this too slow?

Max-
It might be a little slow, but I don't think it is a bad move. Possible alternatives is building s form of chinese fuseki of your own with one of the marked moves.

All in all, I think this move is good and stable though.];B[pj]
LB[nd:B][jp:A]
(;W[jp]TR[dj][mq]C[Max-
A decent move, limiting black moyo at the bottom and aiming to build an own from the left bottom corner.

I marked good follow up moves that white should aim for to expand her moyo.]
;B[cj]LB[cf:A][cl:B]
(;W[cf]C[Max-
White is stregthening a strong stone and missing an apportunity to expand his moyo at the bottom, see variation.]
;B[jc]LB[ec:C][gc:A][pg:D][cl:B]
(;W[gc]C[Max-
A weak move. 

Some goals for white before this move are:
-Stop black moyo on right
-Expand white moyo on bottom left
-Attack weak black stone on C10
-Strengthen white group in top left

This move doesn't do any job very well. See alternative variations.]
;B[cm];W[en];B[el]LB[nc:A][nd:B][pf:C]
(;W[nc]C[D: Looking back, maybe something like M3 or N3 would be better here?

Max-
I agree, this allows K17 to make a base easily.

The low approach is also dangerous here, with black's strong moyo. See possible continuation.]

(;B[lc];W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[Max-
Black makes a big blunder.

Building strength towards his moyo is the correct choice. See variation.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qd]
(;B[md];W[qf]C[Max-
A great move for white. Black has lost right side potential and white's group is feeling free as a bird.]
;B[pg]C[Max-
A mistake. Too close to white and can be cut.];W[pf];B[oe]
(;W[mq]C[Max-
A questionable move and a missed opportunity. See variation.

This move also offers black an exchange of bottom left moyo to his bottom right points. Not a good trade for white.]
;B[on];W[mn];B[nl]C[Max-
This exchange is getting white some potential at the bottom, but it also offers black an absolutely huge area on the right. White needs to destroy as much as he can of it immediately. See possible continuation.]

(;W[he]C[Max-
A slow move. I assume the idea for white is to play at the border of two moyos.

But it is missing the point that black already has huge point potential in the bottom right and white's area in the bottom left must now be converted to points to equal it out.]
;B[dh];W[ke]C[Max-
A bad move. Hardly connected to the weakish H15 stone, this stone doesn't do much to attack or strengthen anything. It offers black a stone to attack into, close to his strong position.

This is a very good opportunity for you. Study this position for some time. You can see how weak H15 is already (weak shape with G17 stone) and now white is adding another weakly connected stone to the chain.

Now look at black's strength on the top right (assuming he would play the critical P14) and how close L15 is to it.

Remember: "Always play away from strength"];B[gg];W[eg];B[eh]
;W[dg];B[fg];W[ff];B[hl]C[Max-
A huge mistake by black. Simply giving away the bottom left without a fight. White can cry out in joy.]
;W[hn];B[gf];W[fe];B[dc]C[D: I definitely feel like this invasion could have been handled better.

Max-
Yes, this should not be possible.];W[cc];B[eb];W[cb];B[gb];W[hb]
;B[gd]
(;W[fb]C[Max-
Here is the blunder. Playing to catch one stone instead of strengthening the general shape and position. See variations.]

[nr:B]C[Max-
Now that we are in the endgame, white should try and find the biggest moves. Usually these are on the sides on the 2nd line.

Remember, endgame is all about sente and initiative. Don't just blindly react to your opponent's move. See if there are ways for you to force a reaction while gaining points.

B,C,D are all sente and huge point moves. White should aim to play these first.]

Max-
This was a fairly passive game, with white letting black build points in the bottom right very easily and black also letting white take a huge area in the bottom left.

After black gave away the bottom left, white could win the game with a solid endgame. Look for the sente moves on the 2nd line and force your opponent to give you points in gote.

Here is an interesting discussion about a common endgame position:
http://senseis.xmp.net/?HowBigIsThe6PointDoubleSente

Concerning your midgame, you can improve by paying close attention to the shape your stones make and how connected they are. Don't connect a stone weakly to an already weakly connected stone.

Your opening looks ok. Pay attention there to which direction you attack opponent stones from. Try to build moyo while attacking. Remember that a 4-4 corner stone is very strong all by itself and don't be afraid to use that.

You also tend to always approach opponent stones low, even when high might be better. Remember that approaching high has the advantage of being more flexible and more easily running away. Keep this in consideration when invading an opponent's moyo.

Ok, that is all for now. I hope you enjoyed this and maybe learned something. I am always glad to discuss any part of the game further or answer questions if you are interested.

Take care,
Max])

Blac is building an impressive moyo on the right and it needs to be invaded at some point. This move would be a decent place to start.]

Now white is getting to have her cake and eat it.

This move builds and expands the bottom left moyo nicely and also attacks the weak stone on C10.
