AB[pd][dp][pp]C[P: Hi.
 My name is Paco. Im flintstone in KGS , Im 4k. You can ask questions if you find me there.

 I will start my coments with P. I will mark the moves I prefer  with triangles, or with a variation.

The general advice about this game is:

1. Read before playing! at least when you start a risky situation.

2. Pay atention to the great areas of the board that are still opened. You both play moves of little importance when there are still big areas empty. Even you play end moves when there are very big moves to make.

3. Both should pay attention to the oponent threats, because sometimes there are no real threat. So READ!!! There are many situations in wich the best move is tenuki. you dont have to answer always your oponent move.]
;W[dd]C[stubdteau [13k?\]: hello];B[dj]TR[fc][cf]C[P: I dont like this move. I prefer the triangled ones.

D10 is pasive, and dont mark really a territoy with D4. It dont have a clear purpose]
;W[nq];B[kq];W[nn]TR[no]C[P: Too far from o3. Easy for black to cut]
;B[pm]TR[pn]C[P: The same than before];W[iq];B[jo]TR[ko]C[P: You are inducing f3. After that I like more black stones with L5 in place, thinking about later attacking o3]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[en];W[jp];B[kp];W[ko]
(;B[kn]TR[lo]C[P: Is easy to see that after w m5, L3 is dead, so read before play]
;W[lo];B[io]
(;W[jq]C[P: This  is an empty triangle: bad shape. 99 % of posibilities of being bad move]
;B[no];W[mo];B[mn]
(;W[oo]C[P: This is a risky move. If you play like this you should read carefully. If you cant, for exaple, just separate with M6 and keep sente. Later you can try to kill his separate groups or take advantage chasing them]

(;B[po];W[mp]C[P: white ended ok because of black mistake. But you cant always count on it.]
;B[qi]
(;W[cq]C[P: This starts an end game sequence. Its too early for this]
(;B[hq];W[hp];B[fr]C[P: White doesnt need to anwer this]
(;W[hr];B[fc]C[P: Now black take benefit of sente];W[cf];B[db]
;W[cc];B[id];W[hc]TR[nc][qf][dr]C[P: I would have let this invasion point for later. There are still empty places to play]

(;B[cn];W[co];B[eo];W[bn];B[ho]C[P: Once again black dont read well and hes not really threating anything, so white take advantage on the left]
;W[cm];B[cl]C[stubdteau [15k?\]: ever been in a pair go game?

C[P: E6 isnt too big. Take a look at the whole board];B[em]
;W[ci];B[dc]TR[qf];W[ed];B[cd];W[ce];B[bd];W[bc]C[P: Here for example, empty triangle is not bad]
;B[be]C[P: What for? After w b14, you can be sure that your stones will bot be useful in the future. If you dont play B15, maybe later you can use them]
;W[bf];B[mm]TR[nc][qf][ok]C[P: This is only one stone what you are trying to save, and you have a big moyo upside with many weakness. etter reinforce it.

You are also inducing him to get into your moyo];W[om]
(;B[pn]C[P: In the followin sequences, black try to stop white completely, but he separate a lot his stones and he end being captured and with white well inside his territory.

Its better to stop him letting him a bit inside, but making black territory sure. see variations]

P11 is not a threat beause the ladder doesnt work. R14 threat both r17 and R17]
;B[fg];W[ef];B[fh];W[ih]TR[qf]C[P: You know that this move will be useful only if black fails, and R14 give yo something for sure]
;B[gg]TR[dh][jk]C[Black have alternatives of killing k13 group enlarging his territory]
;W[jk];B[hi]TR[hj];W[ik];B[hl]C[P: you have been too catious in the last moves and now you dont even read]
;W[ii];B[hj];W[ij]C[P: You have been lucky but you won´t learn anything with this style, because you´ll only get used to win with oponents who fail a lot]
