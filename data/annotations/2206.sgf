C[This is a very close game played on Dragon Go Server - I think was ahead on the board until W made a seki in the lower right and had to clamber back to win by a single point.

My main problem at the moment seems to be picking moves that are big enough that my opponent will answer them.

djna - The game seems to be characterised by some serious reading errors by both players. Was the game played at fast time limits?

After the early flurries, B sems to be very far ahead so it's  surprising that the game ends up so close.   I'm not sure how useful a review concentrating on reading errors would be so I'll try to find some more conceptual things to comment on. If either player finds that they're making these sort of errors in many of their games then they need to do lots of reading practice. The tesjui books are ideal for that.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[co]C[djna - with W I never like to play 3-4 or 5-3 moves, when B plays 4-4. I never seem to have the tempo to make useful shimaris. This is probably just personal taste, but might be worth looking at if W seems often to get bad fuseki results.]
;B[qn]C[djna - I tend to think that the asymmetric stone needs more attention, again probably more taste than absolute good/bad]
;W[nq];B[pj];W[cf];B[fd];W[dj];B[kc]LB[jc:A]SQ[kc]C[I thought this was looking good for me - moyo like

djna- yes B seems to be that tempo ahead, W wants two moves at the bottom.  I'm interested in the unusual position, why not at A? The marked stone is likely to end up too close to a B position in the top right.]
;W[dq];B[iq]C[This seemed a big move

djna - yes this seems ideal. As W I feel that B has retained or even increased his first move advantage. Yet I can't see an obvious alternative for any recent W move.]
;W[qf]C[I was slightly surprised by this - but it seems quite reasonable in order to break up my moyo like area

djna - it's where I would have played. A W strategy of competing on moyos seems doomed to failure.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[ph];B[qi]LB[oj:A]C[I think W could have played 'A' next

djna - the books show A or the move W played as reasonable.]
;W[mg]LB[oj:A]C[djna - as B is strong at the top I'm more inclined to play A]
;B[nj]LB[kg:A]C[This ruined my central ares - but forced me to reinforce the top so I was still satisfied

djna - this sort of action by W was implicit in your framework. You're happy because W still has a group that can be pressured.  B moves such as A may not quite work now (though in hackier moments I'd probably try it !) but already B's top left is more expandable becuase W must be cautious about starting another group up there.]

(;W[pm]SQ[pm]C[djna - this seems like a very odd move to me. I guess that W sees B potential territory and wants to control it.  Problem is that there's no very good follow up and W seems to make B stronger and leave the marked stone not quite connected. I think W should now
try to build up the left - see variation.];B[qm]C[djna - patient, and I think it's good. You're taking profit and asking W to spend a move patching things up]
;W[kq]C[djna - I think that this is the wrong direction. W can't build on a large scale on the right,]
;B[fq];W[eo]C[djna - still W is building, that's a nice move]
;B[io];W[go];B[qq]LB[kg:B][di:A]SQ[qq]C[djna - I think that the left side is threatening to become large. Also B's bottom group is a little unstable. How about A  with a plan to follow up at B if W lets you wall off the left.]
;W[qp];B[rp]
(;W[ro]C[
djna - see variation];B[rq];W[qo];B[or]C[djna - in terms of territory you're each damaging the other. Strategically W seems to be building walls facing strong B positions. This is usually a bad thing to do.]
;W[nr];B[oq];W[op];B[pq]C[djna - this is the large L+1 group unconditionally alive. W has a cutting point that can easily become very troublesome, he also barely has two eyes.]
;W[sp]LB[rs:A]C[djna - with all the L groups(and many other corner positions)  you mustn't answer the hane directly. Instead take the  vital point usually 2-1 or 2-2.  Here  A is right, then  W has no more sente against the corner.]
;B[sq]C[djna - greedy, liberties can matter. The James Davies Live and Death book is well worth having on the shelf.]
;W[os]LB[rr:A]C[Am I correct in thinking that this area should live - barring the normal problems with an 8 space corner (at 'A')

djna - you've probably already gone from life with points to seki.]
;B[ps];W[qs]LB[ns:A]TR[sq]SQ[sp]C[I think I should have just taken at 'A'

djna - all too complicated for me. The point for future reference is not to play the triangle in answer to the square. The rest is just detail of how best to mop up the mess.]

(;B[qr];W[rs];B[ns]LB[rr:B][sr:A]TR[rs]C[I think W let me off here, though I now realise that I need 'A' or 'B' to live

djna - now W has a gote move to make seki. Worth a few points but not big enough to play now.
More importantly W has severely damaged hs group on the outside.]
;W[ms];B[os]SQ[rr];W[lr];B[nm]C[
djna - interesting move, getting some action on the outside and asking questions about W's shape]
;W[pl]LB[pn:A]C[djna- this seems a very odd move. What does W want to do? I suppose that
he's trying to prove that his wall is good by attacking B , but that group looks pretty resilient. Also W needs to worry about A.  This could just be a "take a little profit before patching up" sort of sequence, but things go badly wrong. Suggests to me that W didn't have a sound plan.]
;B[ql];W[ok];B[oj]LB[pn:A]C[djna - surely W must play A now?]
;W[nk]LB[pn:A];B[lm]C[djna - think B should just push through at Q6. But W's position is bad.
He's getting no real work from his wall.];W[mj]C[djna - this is just too ambitioous. W is "thin". The strategic concept here is that you can't attack fiercly if you have a position riddled with defects.  The tactical details may be hard to see (I would not be able to be sure over the baord)  but the sheer number of cutting points should be a warning.]
;B[pn]LB[pk:A][qk:B]C[djna - yes this is good. Important question for B. Did you read out what happens if W plays P6? There are some moves where you must check out the opponent's responses. What about if he exchanges A for B first? It's very important to *know* , if you can, that these responses don't work for W.]
;W[on]C[djna - hard to know what W should do.  Play O4 and accept the local loss. If B takes
some profit  get building on the left? Perhaps W needs K2 as well? This is tough.]
;B[oo];W[nn];B[no];W[po]C[djna - W simply hasn't seen the danger. Very bad error.]
;B[mn];W[om];B[pk]C[This was a bit silly of W - but nice :-)

djna - that should be the game. The profit is good but also you have a lot of power and W still has problems.]
;W[np];B[mo];W[ko]C[djna- I see that W really wants to keep those 3 B stones isolated, but this is very dangerous. B K2 takes away the second eye.

Pushing from the inside is only worth it if you really can cut. Otherwise W needs to live and get building elsewhere.]
;B[jn];W[kn]C[
djna - I'd just K2. W is starting a third Weak group when he cuts.]

(;B[gl];W[hk];B[fm];W[ir];B[hr];W[jr];B[ks]C[
djna - This next sequence is a bit odd.]
(;W[jq]C[djna - looks like a mistake by W, B's later moves get a very large ko.]
;B[ij];W[gk];B[fk];W[hj];B[hi];W[il];B[fj]TR[jm]C[djna - This sequence shows why W's marked cut costs. B should now devastate the left side, or build the top, the ko coming up is an unlikely bonus.]
;W[ii];B[hh];W[ji];B[lp];W[lq];B[ls];W[mr];B[mp];W[hq]C[djna - should be a nice ko for B, admittedly W gets some territory if he wins the ko, but two moves elsewhere must be  worth more.]
;B[gq];W[gr]TR[lp]C[Can I still kill that big W group? - or should I have played differently a few steps back?

djna - seems like a decent ko to fight, W can't afford to lose it, B can afford to.  W should not have allowed the marked move.]
;B[iq];W[ln];B[mm];W[hq];B[gp]LB[og:A]C[
djna - but this is not a ko threat!  Virtually anywhere on the left, or A would be fun]
;W[hs]C[
djna W seems to have made a profit!];B[fo]LB[fh:A]C[
djna - ? Almost valueless.  Makes eyes but if you play A you don't need them and that threatens invasions and building the top.]
;W[fh]C[
djna - worth trying];B[cm]LB[el:A]C[
djna - the various peeps possible make it hard to find the right place to play. The idea seems good but the actual result is rotten. Maybe a conservative move like A would then either get an answer or let B follow up more strongly.]
;W[en]LB[em:A]
(;B[fn]C[
djna - I understand why you played that, but I think you have to follow through on the original plan]
;W[el];B[fl];W[em]C[
djna - how did that happen!! Suddenly W solidifies territory and your group isn't absolutely safe,]
;B[gi];W[ic]LB[lh:A][kj:B]TR[gc]C[
djna - suddenly W has a chance. It's slightly naughty, because the R14 group is not really settled. How much more strength would Black need to play A? B is not quite forcing but it doesn't need much more strength in the area to allow Black to play there, there's some sort of possibility that W ends up with 3 weak groups.]

(;B[hc]TR[qe][pf]C[
djna - attacking is usually best done without contact plays.  The marked exchange is a special case, there B is making  W add a stone to make a heavy attackable group.]
;W[hd];B[gc];W[id]TR[hf]C[
djna - W has made a very heavy clump of stones, perhaps jumping out first is better]

(;B[cd]TR[id]C[I feel I'm letting W get away with too much here

djna - yes, it may be reasonable to go back and patch up, but not until you've pressed the W group a bit.  The marked move is very heavy]
;W[ib];B[kb];W[ke];B[ld];W[qh];B[rf]LB[re:A]C[
djna - tiny overplay,  A has the effect you want and leaves no leverage]
;W[rd]C[
djna - outrageous! This is desparation. Good fun if you can get away with it though!]
;B[re];W[pc];B[oc]LB[qc:A]C[Or should I have played 'A'?

djna - this is fine, the mistake is later];W[qc]LB[rb:A]C[
djna - A is the point that should come to mind.]
(;B[qd];W[rb];B[sc];W[sb];B[pb];W[qb];B[ob];W[sd]C[
djna - ouch.  But now ...];B[qa];W[ra]C[
djna - ... why waste ko threats?];B[se];W[rc];B[ch]TR[cd]C[
djna - W still has attackable groups, it's reasonable to do some work over here first.  Especially as W ignored the makred move.]
;W[dg]LB[fa:C][cj:A][sl:B]C[
djna - W is trying to hang on to everything. After the previous success it may be possible to play safe at A, and take sente to get the big endgame plays at B and C.]
