C[I'm black.

win by resignation because I got lucky creating a large ko.


--- Hello, this is Vinyoo. I'll be reviewing your game.

Overall, I think there are interesting sequences in the upper-right and lower-right corners. \\

In the beginning black plays some questionable moves in the corners that cause white to be ahead. Later on, black captures white's corner and revive upper-right corner to get the lead.

I suggest you learn some basic joseki for 3-4 stones.

To imporve go skill in general, do a lot of life-and-death problems. They need not to be difficult. If you do a lot of them it would help reading ability.

Also, play a lot of games with players a bit stronger than you are.

Lastly, enjoy playing!];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]C[--- Normally, approaching 3-4 stone is more valuable than approaching star-point stone. You may consider approaching white at C15 or D15.

Also, you may close your own corner at P17.]
(;B[fq];W[cn]
(;B[hp]C[what is the joseki here? does black slide into corner first?

-- You can either play D2 or K4.
D2 if you want territory. K4 for moyo.

This move (H4) is in the wrong order, you should play D2 first.]
;W[eq]C[this made me feel scared as the black. should I have ignored it like I did or spend a move defending?

-- Good move for white to protect corner. 

Normally black should extend at F4. However, since black H4 is too close, F4 move is not intersting for now.]
(;B[ch]C[I realized reviewing the game that this move was too slow. Maybe c15 would be best?

-- Yes, usually, it is better to approach 3-4 corner than spliting the half. 

C15 is better.];W[ce];B[ck];W[po]
(;B[op]C[This black move is not a joseki.

You can play R5 to keep the coner safe];W[ql]
(;B[kq]C[was this move necessary?

--- It keep good relationship for black ont he bottom. 

I would prefer to play R4 to pressue white and prevent white from entering the corner.]
;W[od];B[qg]C[felt like a natural response to white

--- This move is better than black joseki at P17.

You also consider pincer around M16 or N17.];W[pc]C[This also is not a joseki move. Should be at R17.]
;B[rp]C[would this have been better instead of L3 to begin with?

--- I think so. Please see variation of move 15.];W[qi]C[Now it is time to play R17]
;B[qn]C[I wasn't sure if attacking here or defending at upper right was bigger

--- You should not attack white now. This white group is not that weak. Your black group in the upper-right is weaker.

Your upper right corer needs reinforcement.];W[pm];B[pn];W[om]
;B[on];W[nm]
(;B[lc]C[I had no idea where the right point to jump in was.

--- White is strong than blck. Should play R17 first.];W[qe]
(;B[qc]C[this time I was furiously trying to figure out what to do with the corner. can black live if white really tries?  is it better for black to move onto doing something else?

--- See variation];W[pe];B[re];W[rf];B[pb];W[ob]
(;B[qb]C[Black should play S18. See variations.];W[rd];B[rc]
;W[se]
(;B[sb]C[This black group is dead. Once you realize that, you should hold back T18 and play some other moves]
;W[jc]C[should white attack the lone black stone or play s19 to kill the corner? both look very large.

--- This is a difficult question. Upper right corner is about 20 points. 

However, white pincer may create more territory than that. So, I think it depends on the player's choice.]
;B[le]C[Here I really wanted to go for s19, but I felt like white would take over the rest of the top if I didn't pull out. At what point should I play s19?

--- It is really difficult decision. Upper right corner is about 20 points. However, if you do not pull out the stone now, you may lose more than 20 points.

Black should play S19 as soon as all black groups are safe.]
;W[je];B[lg];W[dg];B[bf]C[here I was trying to settle the black stones on the left, but maybe it had been better to turn left with the group that was flying in the air by jumping to some (unknown) direction?

--- I think it is OK to establish a base in this case. Black has generous 2-line space between C15-C12 and C9-C6. It is not difficult for black to live locally.]
;W[be]
(;B[cg]C[I don't like this move, yet I keep making it. :(];W[jg]
;B[kh];W[pg]C[I have a feeling that if white had kept pushing the large black group instead of playing this move, he would have won easily.

--- Yes, white is very strong. This move should not be necessary]
;B[jh];W[ig];B[ih];W[mh];B[gh];W[lh]C[Unnecessary move for white.

This move causes white K13 group to get weaker (less liberties).]
;B[kg];W[gf];B[fg]C[Was there a way to enter the white area better?

--- There are some weakness in black's connection. So, I agree to be a bit cautious.]
;W[ff];B[eg]
(;W[ef];B[df];W[de]C[Black is already connected, no need to play D12]
(;B[dh]C[Instead of this move, you may consider closing the center with D6]
;W[dl];B[lj];W[nj]
(;B[ml]C[I was trying to wall off the center  to get more territory, but in retrospect it feels a bit silly when white has the bottom left available to enter. What is the correct way to think in this position?

--- You may try  M7. See variation];W[mn];B[nl];W[ok];B[pl]
(;W[pk];B[rl]C[I thought this was clever until the white replied.]
;W[rk];B[qm];W[ol];B[fr];W[mp]C[this feels like a good reply to e2, where I was threatening to jump into his corner.]
;B[mq]
(;W[ek]C[Should white have jumped out with e9 or defended the corner with f2?

--- Corner is bigger, white should play E2.

If white wants to jump into the center, he should play G8];B[cr]
;W[cq];B[er]
(;W[dq]C[White should play B2];B[bm]C[Good timing by black]
;W[bn];B[eo]C[here I was actually trying to threaten cutting white in hopes of making a wall in due process. actually I got a bit lucky, because I had no idea how well it could cut until couple moves later.

--- This is a good move by black. White needs to play C7 first before jumping out]
;W[gk]C[should I have been more worried about white making this move than I was?]
;B[cm]
(;W[dm];B[dn];W[en];B[do];W[fo];B[fn]C[is there a way for white to cut off the three black stones that I just cant figure out?

--- I don't see a way to capture 3 black stones.];W[em];B[fp]
;W[go];B[ep];W[co];B[bq]C[would white have been able to save the corner after he was cut?

--- Once white was cut, he has to choose the center or the corner.

It is too late to save white after black plays B3 here.

It is probably better to choose the corner and try to reduce center later on.]
;W[bp];B[dr];W[br];B[cp];W[gm];B[hn];W[gn]C[No more attack on white's center. Should just play S19 now]

;B[gi]C[I have no idea what I was doing with black here... any other more useful place except s19, which was still being horribly ignored?

--- You should have played S19 once white lives in the center at the move 111.

S19 is still the most valuable move at this moment. The second most valuable is L18, which is sente for black.]
(;W[dj];B[fj]C[I think c10 would have been a lot larger now that I'm seeing this again.]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[fk];B[gj];W[di];B[eh];W[cl];B[an];W[bl];B[bo]
;W[ai];B[nf]C[too shallow?

--- Now black is leading];W[oo];B[lp]C[correct direction of play?

--- This move is OK.];W[lo];B[np];W[no];B[nc]C[I should have done this later.]

C[is this the right time for white to be picking off small sentes, or is there still something very large left?

--- There is not much large points left in the game. So, small sente moves are OK.

The largest move for white might be T8 since this is sente for both sides who play.]
;W[kf];B[ke]C[good or bad response by black?

--- This black move is not a threat to white. Also, not many points.

B13 or A8 gets more points for black];W[kd];B[hg];W[hf];B[if]

I'm not used to ko, so I'm not really sure what to do with it.

--- This ko is not that big for either side. Black can lose the ko and still just only 1 point.

But, ignoring the known end-result, is this the right time for black to turn his attention on something ensuring that a future ko threat might work, or should he focus on getting the couple extra points that he can make for sure?
