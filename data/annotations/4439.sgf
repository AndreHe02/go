C[Dear reviewer. This is the second game i send in for reviewing. I played white as 17k and lost against a 18k (again).
Although i was able to catch a nice group i lost by 20 points. Mostly because i let black build a vast territory on the top. So I guess I should train the fuseki and yoseki. In general I have the feeling that i lose very much of territory already in the beginning, especially in this game.
Thank you very much for the review in advance.

Hi, I'm Christoph Hohmann, 7 kyu. I wouldn't blame your opening so much. There were plenty of chances to improve your score later in the game. Most decisive errors were 22 S14, 32 D7, 40 K5, 90 M8, where you gave up much potential territory, and 136 H1. Good  moves were L3 (the invasion), 174 E18 and following.]
;B[pd]C[DanielW [17k\]: thx];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd]C[Is there a rule on which 4-3 point i should put my stone according to the situation. Is C16 and D17 the same here?

CH: such subleties are beyond my understanding !];B[fq];W[cn]
C[This is my standard response to black's approach. Is there something wrong with it in this situation?

CH: not at all.];B[iq];W[qn];B[no]C[This seems wuite unusual to me but I did not know how to punish (if possible).

CH: I don't think it's punishable.];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj]C[I often saw rhis kind of opening (two  low approaches to the 4-4 point and then getting the middle. Is this good? Is the Q10 stone too high?

CH:  I've seen it often too, so it seems to be normal. Still, I don't like it: It is thin, encouraging Black to take both corners with sente. I'd rather fight for the corners myself: with S16 or S4.]
;B[fc];W[dc]C[This move was too small i guess, because i allowed black to build a huge mojo on the top. Should I have something like K17 instead?

CH: The end result (after D11) looks good to me. Since I'm a 4,4-player, I don't really know how to follow up the 3,4.]
;B[jd];W[di];B[of];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[rd];W[rf]C[Too defensive?

CH:  Defend you must, but Q12 is much better];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp]
;W[cr]C[C5 instead?

CH: looks OK to me.];B[br];W[dr];B[co];W[do];B[bn]
(;W[dm]C[C7 instead? I feared to be cut at D6.

CH: C7 is best. Your group is not that weak, so I wouldn't fear the cut. It has options to run and an option to (almost) kill the black group. See variations.

Another standard move to consider is the double hane B7 (see variation) which captures three stones and leaves a ponnuki on the outside. But here, the ponnuki kind of ruins your territory.

D7 is the worst choice - D7 is terrible !];B[cm];W[dn];B[bm]
;W[kq]C[An attempt to invade black's territory. I thought there is the most space to try it. And it worked somehow, but I guess it should not have worked. Where els to invade?

CH: The invasion here is OK, if you manage to keep the two black groups separated.]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[mq];W[jo]C[CH:  I'd prefer the solid L4: unlike this K5, it really separates the groups. See variation at 41.]

(;W[jq];B[jr];W[lo]C[For the sake of good shape...];B[ph];W[qh]
;B[pi];W[qi]C[CH: compare this with a white stone on Q12. See how Black got his moyo ?]
;B[mi];W[lg]C[I guess this is too far in black's territory but his mojo grew bigger and bigger...

CH: yes, better at K13 or around H16 first.];B[jh]C[And I'm punished...]
;W[jf]C[Trying to escape in any way...];B[he];W[ig];B[ef];W[df]
C[I thought better to protect my territory than to use this move to help my single three stones in the middle to escape. I thought a lot here but I did not find a better move.

CH: this E14 was a forcing move indeed.];B[dg];W[cg];B[dh];W[ch]
;B[fo]C[CH:  F7 now, it's huge !  If Black gets it, it further reduces your territory and K5 becomes a weak group.]
;W[nh]C[Trying to escaspe again

CH:  H12 is the best escape move. Next, M15 can be played.]

;W[mk]C[CH: nice play.];B[nm]
(;W[nl]C[I guess if i had played O10 - or tenuki perhaps -  he would have connected at O8 and i would have had sente. Then I sould have played at M16 to reduce territory?

CH:   Black's O7 was a mistake - so play M16 immediately, it's the best move. Don't play O10, he'll answer at M16.]
;B[ml];W[nj]C[Now the situation looked not that bad but I only was able to take little advantage of my situation.]
;B[ld]C[I saw no way to invade black's territor on the top. I think my fuseki is just utterly bad.

CH: Key points to play now are at the border of the two territories- E11, followed by F7 or J11, which threatens to pull out J13. E15 is another key point (variations).]

(;W[ll]C[CH:  This M8 doesn't do much. See variations and comments at 89.]
;B[fh]C[CH: He takes a key point !  J13 / K14 are now lost.]
;W[dk]C[I wanted to make sure that my D4 group will be able to connect to my upper left group...

CH: Before running, play B1. If he doesn't react, you're alive while he isn't.
Safer ways of running are D9 or F7.];B[hj]C[CH:  look how much territory Black has made with just two moves - F12 and H10. Compare with White E11 and J11.]

CH: this was the maximum.];B[mm]
