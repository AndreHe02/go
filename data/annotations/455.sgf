longer extension, W can invade at h3 later, so B will want to
play h4
to prevent this.  But after H4, b has too many stones here.

C[This move is played in high handicap games when B already has
a stone on the center star point.  In this game, you should extend
halfway down the side.  Don't be afraid of the cut.

seem a little overconcentrated.

This is the right direction, but the wrong move.  After W is
stable, he can slide under your 4th line stone.  Since W is weak,
you should extend as far as possible, to take the most territory.

need a stone here, you should play here first, then jump, but
I don't think you need a stone here.

C[This move just runs away, and asks W to take lots of terriory
on the left.  You don't want to
force W to take territory, so yuo should run the other way if
you feel you have to run with this group.
]BL[618];W[dk]WL[660]

connecting under and taking some territory.

C[This is your strong side.  If you want to attack white, you should
play from the other side.  Almost always it is better to attack
from your weak side and drive the opponent toward your strength.
]BL[546];W[im]WL[608];B[ll]

your wall behind it has a big hole in it.  It would be good if
the wall was solid.

C[your two attacking moves and your wall making move have surrounded
10 points of territory, but you gave up two prisoners.  So you
gained 7 points with 2 moves (since he answered one of them),
about 3.5 points per move.  This is not enough at this stage
of the game.  If you want to make territory in the center, you
have to think on a larger scale.  The move at Q18 is
a 12 point gote move, or worth 6 points per move, almost twice
as big as your moves in the center.

it is one point gote.
