C[[GTL\] To the reviewer: any notes I added after the game for the purpose of your review have [GTL\] in front of them. Everything else was in-game kibbitz. I've run a number of variations in different places, but rather than clutter up the file for you I left them out.

Thanks very much for your time and attention!

(;B[nc];W[po];B[mq]C[lojban [13k?\]: hi
lojban [13k?\]: it might be I'm playing some strange baduk :)]

(;W[ql]C[Piz [11k\]: :)
Piz [11k\]: Well I know for sure I'm not as good as the ranking system thinks I am

DC: Possible but black can make white overconcentrated quite quickly with R4. Therefore playing 3/3 as is often the case is vital. Black incidentally should play R4 Immediately.]

(;B[jc]C[lojban [13k?\]: well];W[cg]C[lojban [13k?\]: maybe the game will tell]
;B[iq];W[gq];B[qh];W[dm];B[in];W[dj]C[DC: A good response here to the slightly empty move of J6.]
;B[jf]C[DC: The tsuke at R3 is still quite hot as a move right now or R$ for Black.]
;W[qf]C[[GTL\]I'd like some advice on how I could have handled this invasion better.

DC: It is not the most open are right noe and no tparticulally urgent so playing E17 shimaru or R3 would be better and calmer.]

(;B[rg];W[qb]C[DC: This is a good punnishment for Black S13.]

(;W[re]C[DC: The way to improve here is to do many problems, maybe even using goproblems.com]
;B[rb];W[sd];B[pb];W[of];B[mh];W[pe];B[fc]C[DC: White is in trouble if black plays Q13.]

(;W[ec]C[[GTL\] I think the exchange from here up to move 63 went fairly well (except for the big weakness I left behind at F12 and never noticed :P), but I probably could have handled it better.

DC: The touching of the black stone here is bad and black playing f16 is excellent now for black leaving a corner invasion behind, white should simply play D18 locally with follow up then at f18 if black does not play.]
;B[fe]C[White can capitolise on this by playing f18.]
(;W[fg]C[lojban [13k?\]: so..
lojban [13k?\]: how much IS your rank really

;W[ii];B[ih];W[hi];B[ij];W[gj];B[gk];W[fj];B[fk];W[mo]C[[GTL\] I like this move because of the potential ladder at H9 and the pressure it puts on N3 while beginning to push into all that open space above. Is that good thinking or am I missing something?

DC: You are missing the 3/3 point to settle very quickly.]
(;B[pm];W[hk]C[[GTL\] Was this the wrong time for this move?]

(;B[gn];W[ik];B[jj];W[jk];B[qm]C[[GTL\] The sequence beginning here and ending at move 96 ended up OK for me, though I think that's as much a result of B making mistakes as anything I did.]
;W[rm];B[rn];W[rl];B[qp];W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[ro];W[ol]C[[GTL\] I'm kinda proud of this move, because it's the first time I ever made a net of this kind.]

;W[cm];B[cl];W[bl];B[bk];W[bm]C[[GTL\] As always, I thought I was losing (and by a lot). I don't know how to count, but KGS's score estimator puts me ahead by 6.5 at this point (although it says the D2 group is dead), so it's clearly far from over. I don't know why B resigned.

DC: The score estimator is unreliable there is a ko at B1 for white to start to kill. One should estimate the score oneself in order to gain strength. End of comments.)
