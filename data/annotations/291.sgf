Game reviewd by Richard Rumley (rumley@sei.com)

Hard to review a game that is one big fight, but my impression on why Black
lost is because of the inconsitancy of play in the lower left hand side.   Black
starts off with a san-ren-sei, and two extensions from it.  Then when White
invades the corner, Black should build a wall and a huge moyo.  Instead, Black
plays a Joseki where black takes a small corner, and white gets out.  I  believe
that is Black would have sealed in white here, that the game would have been  very hard for white.]

KM[0.5];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[ce];B[jd];W[dj]C[I think W should play around O3 or so.   But this move is OK too.]
;B[jp]C[Seems Black is good here.];W[qq]C[I don't think that white should attack the corner like this.   Black should be very
happy and try to build influence here.];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr]C[Black should play at O3 instead.  Blacks goal should be to let White live
small in the corner, while Black gets an absolutely HUGE moyo on the
right side.  Playing this way, Black will get a small corner, and white will
snake out any sort of moyo that black built up.];W[nq];B[op];W[mr];B[pr]
C[Even here, I think  that I would play O5 and get a wall.  Make White take
the O2 stone, and take sente somewhere else.];W[ns];B[qr]C[Now white has sente.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[np];B[no]C[I would not play  here.  Rather, black should play at K6, and force white to play
up into an area where black is strong.  This is good stratigy.  The right side
will be too small if black looses the K4 stone.  You can kinda look at it this
way.  Black can get 14 x 6 rows on the left, and 4x4 rows on the top.
About 100 points
If white caputres K4, then white has 19x4 rows on the left, and 9x 5 rows
on the bottom.  About 121 points.     (Of course, it is too early to talk about firm points.  This is just an  approximation.]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[mn];B[lp]C[Probably better to  jump to the middle first, or jump to the left.  It is
very hard to attack a solid wall.  "Like throwing eggs at a brick wall"  a go player once said.]
;W[nm];B[rp];W[mp];B[fq];W[hq];B[cq]C[Good.
Instead of jumping directly into the corner.  You might have played on top
of the H3 stone at H4.  Just to probe white and see what white would have
done.];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm]
;B[bm];W[bl];B[nj]C[What is the purpose of this  stone?  It is to make a moyo on the top right
corner.  Right?  Now lets look at Blacks next move.];W[ok];B[pk]C[Not consistant play with previous move.   Should connect against the peep, and make
the moyo in the top right corner.  Very hard to make a wall into territory.     Plus,
Upper right is bigger than lower right.];W[oj];B[oi];W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B
[qh];W[oh];B[ni];W[nh];B[mk]C[This move  invites W to play at O9, which black doesn't really want white
to play.  Probably better just to atari at P8 now.  Then jump out and rescue  the
three stones.];W[nk];B[ml];W[nl]C[A white move at P7 instead would  be a guaranteed connection]

;B[qj];W[rk];B[sm];W[mj];B[mi];W[lj];B[li]C[2 black groups in trouble.  This is hard  for black]
;W[lk];B[lm];W[ki];B[lh];W[km];B[kl]C[I don't this this works.  Might work at M6 instead.]
;W[ln];B[ll];W[jl];B[kk];W[kj];B[kh];W[jk];B[qd];W[of];B[nd];W[rj];B[qg]
;W[ld];B[mf]C[Good idea];W[me];B[ne];W[nf];B[kf]C[Should be solid play  at M14 or atari at M15 before move at L14.]

for B now.];W[gf];B[gg];W[gd];B[lc];W[ng];B[pg];W[mc];B[lb];W[nc];B[md]
