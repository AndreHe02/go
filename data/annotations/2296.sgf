C[X: Dear Reviewer,
I
seem to have hit a (hopefully temporary) plateau at 13k* on IGS, and have
been hovering there for a couple of weeks now.  One player in particular
has been a thorn in my side, although an enjoyable one.  I just can't seem
to beat this guy, "takakiyo (12k*)."  He seems to have excellent reading
skills, and a good grasp of life and death.  Most of our games, I get significantly
ahead on territory, but then he manages to kill something.  So I tried playing
a bit more defensively this time, but ended up losing by a big margin anyway,
probably BECAUSE I wasn't as aggressive as usual.  I didn't make as much
of my moyo in the top right as I could have, and I let his bottom left and
center get much too big.

So, how could I have played better?  I'm determined to beat this guy, eventually.

(My comments prefixed with "X:" for Xopods.)

This is a very good game for comments. There are some typical mistakes, you might be able to avoid in the near future. My impression is: There are two basic type of wrong moves, you are doing. If you can avoid doing them, you will be able to gain 2-3 stones.     Mistake 1: sometimes you are answering a move of your oponent, which you dont need to answer.   Instead of answering you could "take sente" and play elsewere. Avoiding this type of mistake is very important in becoming stronger. You should always strive to take sente and only answer if it is really essential to answer. Taking sente easily means gaining 10-15 points in the middle game and early endgame. Also in the late endgame you should not answer all moves of your oponent, which look vaguely like sente, but look for your own big moves.

2. dont push into the knight move. if two stones of your oponent are linked with a knight move, it is rarely good to push into it. By answering the connection of the oponent stones will become stronger. So you helped him.   This falls in the category of "thank you moves". There are always more possibilities to attack a knight move. Wait how the game develop and decide at the right moment, what to do about it.

my comments are prefixed with "B:" for Bink. The comments on moves of category 1 (answering unnnecessary) or category 2 (thank you moves) are prefixed "BB:". Please take those "BB:"-comments particularily serious. It is most important for you to avoid those mistakes.]

C[X:
Every game I play against this guy starts this way, then I take the last
open corner.  It seems like a pretty even start for both of us, which is
why I keep playing it (under the assumption that my mistakes come later).
 As for him, I guess he just decided not to mess with success.

B:   The opening so far is good. I would prefer to play black here.]
;B[ed]C[X: Usually I play D17 here, but decided to try a more influence oriented strategy as an experiment.

B: E16 is good (I play for influence myself). D17 seems not so good.
C16 is clearly better then D17: After that
Whites natural move would be E16 or E17, and you could play a pincer which would be at the same time an extension from your hoshi point (Q16)]
;W[cd]C[X: Of course.];B[df];W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[cf];B[jd]
C[X:
I don't know my 5-4 point josekis, so I decided to just mimic the 3-4 point
one.  I realised that he could cut, but my upper side group seemed fairly
strong, so I figured the ensuing fight wouldn't be unfairly skewed for either
of us.

B:   This is not so good. Whites attachment
at C14 needs to be answered (By the way: nearly always an attachment against a single stone needs to be answered: There are two oposing stones, touching each other, and who ever plays first will have an advantage).

The reason this move is played in the 3-4 Joseki is: Otherwise white could attack the three black stones by playing around J17 and they would be robbed of their base. Here this is not (yet) necessary as you are extending downwards anyway.

The right direction is C13. sealing white in. This would also fit to your original strategy to go for influence.

White should now play D13 and be very happy and build a big moyo.]
;W[de];B[ef]C[B: good!];W[ee];B[fe];W[ff];B[eh]C[B: more natural would be D12. white could hardly allow C13, so white should anser C13 and then you play E12 and get an excelenet position. whites cut at F14 is an overplay.]
;W[gf];B[if]C[B: more natural is H15. H15 erases all aji on the upper side.]
;W[gh];B[dh]C[X: Too heavy?

B: no, good move.];W[bh]C[This white move leaves a big weakness. Black should play at a given oportunity B11 and seal white in.]
;B[fj]C[B: good move!];W[ig];B[jf];W[ii];B[cg]C[BB: This move is no good at all! But it is a very good example to show the badness of  "pushing into the knight move".     1. it is clear: white will answer B13. you stone on C13 is nearly no help for you: your stones were already connected.
But white B13 is a big help for white. whites conection is now completely solid.

2. In principal black has also other moves to continue here (mainly B11 or B13, here B13 does not make much sense, but given a different surrounding also B13 could be a nice threat). Black should not play a move which robs him of the other possibilities. this takes some worry from white.

3. Here black has the nice tesuji of B11 to seal white in. Continuation 1: C12, C11, D11, but now D10 captures the cutting stone (because of your good move F10). continuation 2: C11, B13, C12, C13.

4. even if you dont see the tesuji:   keep in mind: continuing without the C13, B13 exchange is better for you. Dont push into the knight move!
Here I would even say: just before your move I prefered black, now I prefer white.]
;W[bg];B[cj]C[X:
This doesn't look too bad, does it?  my territory on top looks bigger than
his corner, and my weak group seems a tad stronger than his, if only because
it's got the edge of the board nearby to make eyes.  As usual, against this
guy, I felt like I was off to a good start, but everything fell apart later.

B: I would prefer to continue with white. But the position is probably still rather even. white will now attack from the lower side, and get teritorry there. you dont have much territory yet (on top you got a nice moyo - but no territory)   white is in the driving seat. he is going to attack. his own weak group has two directions to develop.]
;W[cm];B[dl]C[X:
Since reading "Attack and Defense" by Ishida and Davies, the shoulder hit
has become one of my favorite moves when defending a weak group or making
a moyo.  Maybe I use it too much.  It's okay here, though, isn't it?  Sort
of a leaning attack...

B: No, I am not happy with that move. If white plays D7 and the game continues that direction, black gets a nice wall and the corner can become very big. your wall will face your own stones. You should rather play something like M11, trying to avoid strengthening whites lower left corner. Maybe you can use the impetus of whites weak group (which will run) to strengthen your own group and run into whites moyo. but all this is rather difficult (look at the chapter "inducing moves" in the book you mentioned.)

Look also again at typical situations where the shoulder move is played. Here maybe the shoulder move D6 springs to mind. But I think for that your group is to weak.

as we are speaking about that book: pushing into the knight move would be called "thank-you move" there.]
;W[dm];B[el];W[dq]C[B: very big! but now you can get profit by attacking white.]
;B[kh]C[X: Since I'd originally
been going for an influence strategy by taking the 5-4 point, my goal here
was to build a big wall facing my hoshi stone while attacking his middle
group.  Looks like a success so far... although his bottom left is looking
awfully big.

B: good move! Dont look at whites big corner, look at your own chances!]
;W[gj];B[fi]C[BB: To defensive! you were attacking! Now you seem to think G10 is an attack on you. (Or do you want to live on a small scale, sealed in? This is nearly always bad strategy).
Move out! Maby G7. You dont have to be afraid of a white move like F11 or f9. you just play E10 and you are stable as steel!]
;W[gi]C[BB: No need for white to do that either!];B[gk]C[B: To close to oponents group. If you want to attack, its nearly always more effective from the distance. : white will answer, and you will have to answer again, during this process white will get stronger.     You goal in attacking is not killing the oponents stone, but rather milk them. Get profit elsewere while attacking. You already did this on the right side.]
;W[hk];B[gl];W[hl]C[X: Maybe this sequence just helped him.  How else could I have played?

B: Attack from the distance instead.];B[fo]C[X:
Didn't want to get sealed in, even though I'm pretty sure I could have lived.
 This guy has a knack for killing me when I think I'm unconditionally alive,
and letting him seal off the whole bottom left probably would have been game
over anyway.

B: Thats right.];W[fq];B[hn]C[X: Trying to keep him separated, keep the
pressure on... although maybe I should just start strengthening my top right
moyo...

B: the direction is right. I would have played H5 as this is threatening H3]
;W[qf];B[qi]C[X: Pincer correct in this situation?

B: Yes. But for some reason exactly this pincer is hardly played. Here Q11 looks nice: Fits better to R6, and also to your influence oriented game.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[X:
This is the right side, isn't it?  I thought I knew how to handle this, but
I think I made a mistake in the ensuing sequence...

B: Its the right side. Good!];W[qd];B[pf]C[B: Q15 is called for.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[qe];B[pg];W[pb]C[B: Its difficult now. But no question: you should play P18 here. With all your strength in that area, you cannot be afraid of a fight. Influence oriented game means: Building influence and looking for fights.]
;B[nc];W[nb]C[B: This hurts! I would say: Game over now.];B[mb]
;W[ob];B[mc];W[pl]C[B: Overplay. With all your strength around, whites stone will have trouble.]
;B[oj]C[B: Wrong side: Dont attack from the side of your strength but from the other side: Driving the oponent toward your strength.
This is very important indeed! Isnt this the main message in "attack and defense"? But I must admit, I think I only learned that, when I was already 2 kyu. Before, like you here, I thought about the area I am getting. But please be sure: This is a very typical situation and a very typical mistake.  You want to play P6 instead. Maybe you would even be back with a winning chance after that.]
;W[nl];B[om]C[B: To late. And after white connects, your stone will not even be safe]
;W[ol];B[mk];W[nm];B[on];W[lm];B[kn]C[X: Overplay?  Seeing what happened next, this seems like it might have been the game losing move.

B: I think you are behind.
Lets do a count:   white: upper right 15
upper left: 18
lower side: 40

black: lower right: 15
upper side: 40 (you cannot count much more, because of whote moves like H16)
left side: 6
   Maybe you can argue about some points, but I think white is ahead.

Here you might want to seperate whites group around H11 from thr rest. K7 looks better.]
;W[hm];B[gm]C[B: G6 is corect shape. This looks like an automatic blocking move. In the future: Always if you want to do an automatic blocking move: hesitate for a little, think if you can find a better defensive move, or if you can even do no defensive move at all. Here you need a defensive move, but G6 is far far better.   Reason 1: white J6 can be answered stronger (Now J6 threatens atari against H6 next move)
Reason 2: G6 probably makes black H3 possible.
Precondition (easy to check): Black G6 keeps all connections.]
;W[in];B[ho];W[kl];B[mn]C[B: This does not produce a connection, so dont do that moves. It only takes away your own aji and makes white stronger]
;W[nn];B[io]C[BB: Dont push into the knight move.
Wait for chances to do something later.
Maybe G3 is an option. Maybe later you want to play K5 instead of J5]
;W[jo];B[jn];W[im];B[lq];W[ln]C[B: strange move. White should play H3]
;B[nr]C[B: strengthens white. You can only play this way for endgame profit, if you abandon all hope to do anything else with your stranded stones. But if you give up that hope, its like giving up the game. Try something completely different in such a situation. Some kind of crazy move, like K3, just to get experience.]
;W[mr];B[or];W[mq];B[lr];W[ms];B[iq];W[ip];B[hp];W[jq];B[ir]
;W[jr];B[gq];W[fp];B[gp]C[BB: unnecessary defensive move. All stones are connected , so its just for a few points; you might not get them anyway. Its endgame now: Always look for big moves. Like S8 or H15.
This cost you maybe 8 points.];W[lj];B[mi];W[mj];B[nj];W[li]
;B[lh];W[nk];B[jg]C[B: To small. 6 more points gone.];W[ih]
;B[js];W[ks];B[is];W[ls];B[cl];W[bm];B[bl];W[po];B[qm];W[qo]
;B[ro];W[pp];B[rq];W[ql];B[rl];W[rk];B[rm];W[qj];B[pj];W[ri]
;B[qh];W[rh];B[qg];W[rg];B[eb];W[db];B[fb];W[hd]C[B: A little late, but still a good move!]
;B[he]C[B: This looks like an overplay to me. black must submit with H17]
;W[ge];B[gd];W[hc];B[hf]C[B: Rather strange. This is no sente. white should play K18 (or milder: G18) now.]
;W[hg]C[B: But white believed it to be sente!];B[ic];W[hb]C[B: Correct form is G18. And I am rather sure: white G18 kills your stones.]
;B[ib];W[gb];B[id]C[B: Now: one can see that the white stone at H18 serves no purpose. A wasted move.]
;W[ga];B[fa];W[dd];B[ia];W[da];B[ha]C[X:
I was somewhat proud of myself for reading this out properly.  For a second,
he had me scared that he'd managed to kill something like he usually does.

B: I think, he could have.
But just to put the picture right:   If black would have killed those stones of yours, he would have 26 more points. You loose a similar amount of points by 3 "unnecessary defensive moves" in middle game or early end game. So work to avoid them!]
;W[ch];B[fg];W[gg];B[dg];W[eo];B[fn];W[al];B[ak];W[am];B[aj]
C[BB: G2 is far bigger. L11 is a big move, you should play now. Also in the endgame: Dont answer every move which looks like sente. Black is threatening to get 2 or 3 more points in gote by playing atari at B9. Leave those 3 points to him and play two far bigger moves elsewhere.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[fr];B[en];W[dn];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj]C[BB: You dont have to answer every white move! well: in reality, if you see the right continuation B10 is not so small. But still: I am suspecting you just answered the white move.]
;W[fh];B[ai]C[B: unfortunately you overlooked the endgame tesuji B14 if white C15 black a13. white B15, black A11, white A14, black A12, white B14.]
;W[af];B[oc];W[eg];B[na];W[qa];B[ki];W[kj];B[jj]C[B: Very good!]
;W[jk];B[ji];W[ij];B[oo];W[no];B[oa];W[pa];B[ma];W[ah];B[gs]
;W[fs];B[hq]C[BB: This move brings (nearly) no points, you only do this move, when white forces you by playing H1. You are loosing a move!]
;W[em];B[fm];W[pk];B[nh];W[ns];B[sk]C[X:
Stupid to ignore that last move.  He destroys several points of territory
now.  Given the final result, though, the game was already lost.]
;W[sj];B[sl];W[os];B[ps];W[qr];B[qq];W[pr];B[rr];W[qs];B[rs]
;W[ps];B[hs];W[pm];B[pn];W[fg];C[Game over.  White wins by a painful 26.5.
B: I think its 27.5 points, as black has to capture at G17 (after white E19)]
