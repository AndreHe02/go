AB[pd][dp]C[Hello thanks for reviewing my game (I played white). I think it was very close most of the time, but I never had the feeling i'm in advantage.
At most I wanna know how to improve me joseki and how to answer black b13. Are there any big weak points i mist? Again thanks for your effort.

Hi faultier. In general you played according to your level, but we are going to try to improve it by stressing some general strategic concepts and some tactical as well.

(;W[qn]TR[oc][pd][pg][pp]SQ[dp]C[Now is time for some strategic considerations.
If you want to improve your level, you should learn a bit about "direction of play". 
The concept is not so difficult: before making an important move like R6, you should ask yourself  "what is going to happen next?". 

R6 is an aggressive move and you must be careful, because there are 4 black stones around you. What is going to happen? Black is going to attack you and at the same time he is going to make points while you try to live. Result: you live and make few points, black makes tens of points and become really strong.]

(;W[qi]C[(see comments below)];B[mp];W[ql]C[This is very painful for white. Now black is getting a lot of points and white must live. Therefore, what was the point of R6?

At this very moment, black is winning and white must catch up.]

;B[bb];W[fc];B[jj]C[Nice timing for black. Actually, I'm very surprised that you gave him 2 handicap stones.

In this kind of situation, you must spend a bit of time and make your plan again. This moment in the game is crucial, because we are passing from fuseki to chuban (middle game phase).

What is black trying to do?

Apparently he wants all the diagonal from A1 until T19.

What do you want for you?]
(;W[jm]TR[cc][pg][pn][fp][mp]C[You made this move and is not a bad move, but is pretty ambitious. 
This means that you don't want him to invade you, that you want it all. Sadly, black has many "friends" around (triangled friends), so it will connect to one of his friends for sure.

(;W[iq]TR[cc][pd][pp]C[Our plan could be this:

- First invade the only weak point that black has (triangled groups are alive)

- Second, make a base for our group to be alive.

- Third, having that base, try to attack while living or at least make points on the left. If you attack from both sides, is easier, and now you have 2 groups compressing black's weak group.

Anyways, you are deleting black's bottom points (that's called a reduction).

(;W[nq]C[Why to play here instead of R6?
Go to move 7 in the main game and you'll know.

*****************************************************

When making important moves in the fuseki (first stage of the game), you must have a plan. At least one simple idea of what do you want, and what you don't want your opponent to get.

I reccomend you to play O3 instead of R6 because our plan is to let black have some points on the right side (he has already played 4 stones there, so it's in his plan to get it). So black happily will protect his precious right side (that was already his), while you nicely and without risks take the bottom side.

(see variation)];B[pn];W[fq]
(;B[dn];W[jp]C[This is one option. White takes the bottom comfortably with only 3 stones. 

The corners are still open and can be invaded later.])
(;B[hq];W[fo];B[dn];W[dr];B[cq];W[kq]C[Now it's white the strong one, and can take advantage of it by making some points while attacking black.

Note that the corner is still open and can be invaded.])))
(;W[jd]LB[lc:B][qc:D][dd:A][ld:C]C[Your move in L17 is too low. There is a proverb that says that third-line players are losers. When you have a stone at A, you should play at K16, because is very flexible and dynamic.

For example, if black invades/cuts at B, you should reply at C, but there are many variations and some of them involve ladders and are very difficult to read. Just remember that you can always invade at D.

Anyways, black won't cut at B at this early stage.

;B[oc]TR[kc][jd][ld][ke]SQ[pp]C[This is one of the variations.
Black made a wall and got some points, but you took the corner in sente AND made a nice ponnuki (the triangled stones). A ponnuki is a very strong shape.

I think that is a fair result for both sides, because black rectangled stone combines perfectly with the wall and can quickly develop a big moyo on the right and center.

Can you guess where would you play next?
Hint: you don't want black to make a big moyo.];W[qn]C[Exactly, you should do "something" about black's potential moyo.]
