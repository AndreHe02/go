i am tonypoon
here's my opinion about this game
(i had send you a game before. do you remember me?hope you do)]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[dd];B[qn];W[cn]C[i don't know whether this is right to react the opening of black.should i play at F3 or other place?

--> It's common for white to split around k3 to prevent b from having too big a moyo on the bottom.  I don't think f3 is very attractive because b can have an ideal pincer/extension move.  So if you're going to approach, c6 is the right spot.]
;B[dl];W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[-->wrong direction for black.]
(;W[bp]C[--> This is a mistake, given b's nice position on the bottom right.  You have a perfect opportunity to reduce the effectiveness of his bottom by playing d3 here...(see variation)]
;B[dq]
(;W[cr]C[--> bad move.  b2 is joseki.  see next variation for what b could have done.]

(;B[dn];W[bo];B[cm];W[cg];B[nc];W[lc];B[od]C[How should i react? i was confused during the play.

--> You should be happy that b is asking you to strengthen your weak 4th line stone.  Also, a good rule is that if your opponent asks you to crawl on the fourth line, you should *always* do it.  Here you have two options: Q17 is a fighting move that seeks to take away b's base, and Q15 is a territory oriented move that lets b settle but makes secure territory.]

(;W[jd]LB[pd:A]C[finally i chosed to play at K16 .is it alright?or should i rescue A?and how can i do that?


--> a bad move.  K16 misses the chance to make territory in the upper right while threatening the b group, and is a major mistake.  You want to keep b's outnumbered group off-balance.  k16 doesn't even secure territory because the gap between it and the d16 stone is too big.  

P16 was a bad move by black that would have given you a chance to strengthen youself.]
;B[qc]C[--> the third bad move in a row.  q17 make more sense.]

(;W[qe]C[-->the fourth bad move.  why not cut at q17?];B[pc]
;W[pg]C[--> if you want to settle, r 12 is a better move.  but either way you've created a weak group that b can attack while extending from his bottom corner.]
;B[qh]C[--> b has the right idea, but r 11 better style.];W[qg]
;B[pj];W[jq]C[is this alright?

--> it's necessary.];B[hq];W[mq];B[eb]LB[eb:A]C[i dont know how to react.do you have any suggestions?

--> Bad timing for b.  Black should have kept attacking the bottom group, and then started attacking the upper right group -- white would not have time to secure this corner until then anyway.  Press your advantage first, then invade.  

-->
The standard response is d17.  Make black crawl on the bottom and live in gote while you secure the left side and make a moyo framework on the outside]
;W[cb];B[fd];W[gc];B[fc];W[gb]C[-->gote territory when you have a weak group to attack is not usually a good idea, but in this case it helps rob b of a base, so it is okay.]
;B[ff];W[ee];B[fe];W[eh];B[ci]C[--> b is greedy for territory on the bottom.  He really should run first with his long heavy group.]
;W[gi];B[hg];W[ih];B[if];W[he];B[fh];W[fi];B[eg];W[dg];B[gh]
;W[hh];B[ie];W[id];B[hf];W[ge];B[gf];W[op]C[-->  ???

--> You should be attacking the big heavy group with something like m13 -- remember, you have a weak group on the upper right you would like to connect and strengthen in sente....]
;B[lf];W[kf]C[i played this because i thought i can hold the dragon.however, i was wrong.

--> definite overplay, especially since your group on the upper right is not fully alive yet]

;B[ii];W[jj];B[hi];W[hj];B[ig]C[the dragon is alive];W[ij];B[ef]
C[--> small move by black];W[dj]C[--> should be d11, stay connected.]
;B[ei];W[ej];B[di];W[ck];B[bk];W[fl];B[cj];W[dk];B[cl];W[fk]
;B[lg]
(;W[kd]C[--> bad move, too submissive and gives b good shape.  see variation]
;B[lh];W[ke];B[nf];W[eo];B[do];W[ho];B[gp];W[go];B[fn]C[this is another play which confused me a lot.

--> you did well, though.  This is not a good move by black, though it looks like a tesuji.]
;W[em]LB[en:A][gm:B]C[i think  he will play at A and i play B to cede one to him for my great wall.
am i correct?

-->this is a good move.  whatever b does, he is not in good shape here.  But if he plays A, you should first play d7, threatening to cut at b8 or b10..  This separates black.  Then you can connect at f5 and enjoy threatening his group.]

(;B[dm]C[so, is his play at F7 wrong?

yes, f7 was not a good play, because b must fill d7 here.  

If he does not... (see variations)];W[en];B[fo]C[--> another big mistake]
;W[fp];B[ep];W[fq];B[fm];W[el];B[hm]C[he made a mistake

--> yes, a bad one.];W[gm];B[hn];W[gn];B[dh]
(;W[lk];B[ln]C[from this onward, i tried to kill the big dragon at the centre.are there any wrong play?

-->no, you fought well.   b is too weak in the center to fight as he tried.  He should have played more lightly and then hoped to use the aji to break up your territory.]

I made many mistake. luckily, my opponent made many mistake during the fightings.
its my first time to do this seriously. are there any important factors that i should care about during the ...?
sorry to disturb you again.thx for your help!!!


--> I tried to give you ideas abot the important factors during the comments.  In general, I would say you should concentrate on two main, related points.  

1) strengthen your weak groups whenever your opponent gives you a chance (like in the upper right (q16).  Keeping your groups strong is usually a better idea than trying to take territory.  (as your opponent, who tried taking lots of territory and got into trouble w/ fights, shows)

2) always try to stay connected, and separate your opponent when you can.   Connection=strength.  Using strength and opponent's weaknesses is the best way to make territory -- much better than gote extensions, etc., in most cases.  

You're a good fighter, so if you follow the above and play solidly, you should  make good progress.

Hope this helped!])
