C[Hi, thank you very much for reviewing my game.

It's a tournament game, one that I liked the least of the five games there. It just didn't go well and I'm not clear on what I could do better.]
;B[jj]C[An unordinary game...];W[ji]C[janr: I played a similar tsuke recently.  Black should not expect that white will quietly take an ordinary more in a corner ...]
;B[ii];W[ij]C[janr: I like the counterhane too for white.];B[kj]
;W[jh];B[hi];W[ik]C[janr; The disadvantage of the cross-cut is that black now has sente.  But white is stronger and so he welcomes fighting]
;B[li];W[jl];B[gk];W[ig];B[hg];W[hf];B[gg];W[je];B[fe];W[ll]
;B[oj];W[ol];B[qj]LB[le:A]C[janr: maybe extending towards the top puts more pressure on white and develops faster.
I would think about a move around A.];W[lg]C[i didn't get this move. L13 seems to be important, but not playable now. It threatens with the cut, but still, why here?

janr: now both white groups are making space to live/settle, while that black group has potential cuts.]
;B[nk];W[nl];B[ql];W[qm];B[oq]C[I didn't see a way to get in, so i made another group]
;W[qq]
(;B[pp]C[janr: I don't like this move.
It strengthens white, takes away aji and does not help black a lot.
See variations];W[qp];B[po];W[rn];B[lq];W[jq];B[qn];W[qo];B[pn]
;W[pm]C[The black wall does not create a lot of eye space];B[lo]
;W[og]LB[jo:A][kr:C][nr:B]C[And now the same problem...

janr: White could continue the attack at e.g. A.  points like B then become dangerous for black.

The game move is an excellent point at the separation of the influence areas.]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[qg]C[I didn't want to get into trouble with the group, but he could block and made quite a good profit]
;W[qf]
(;B[pg]LB[rf:A][rg:B]C[janr: I would consider A or B. 
see variations. I'm unsure what way is optimal, but the game way of living looks very submissive.]
;W[pf]C[Having the hane on top of the two stones can not be a good shape for black.]
;B[rf];W[re];B[rg];W[qd]C[I think that an invasion to top right is too slow now]
;B[do];W[ce];B[cg];W[bg];B[bh];W[dg]
(;B[df]C[janr: playing the simple connection is much more simple and does not leave all kinds of cumbersome aji for black.]
;W[ch];B[cf];W[bf];B[bi]C[black ends in gote.  White is alive due to the aji.]
;W[em];B[gm]C[I want to kill it];W[eo];B[ep];W[fo];B[dn];W[fm]

(;B[eq]C[janr: I would prefer to finish the left side.  It would take sure territory and leave better attacking opportunities for later.]
;W[dm];B[gn];W[go];B[ho];W[hp]
(;B[io];W[gq];B[fr];W[bn]
(;B[cn]C[janr: an empty triangle. 
I would prfer a simple defensive move];W[cm];B[bo]C[I didn't read the left side well enough]
;W[ci];B[cj];W[dj];B[ck];W[ei];B[de];W[cd];B[cl];W[bl];B[ek]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[el]C[Now its over. But even if I saved it, I would be far behind. Where is the critical moment?

Thank you very much :)

janr:  With the central running fight in the opening, the proverb of playing at the focal point of two moyo's or running groups or influence area's is very important.  

Next, I think black strengthened white too much in the process of taking what he wanted to be his. (two weak groups and a few points on the left).  Flexible play resisting against the opponent plan is important and often a lot of fun.]
