C[Dear reviewer, I am Kurato1 and i play white here.
I am interesting in a fuseki mistakes, urgent points that i miss and weak points in my shapes and connections.

Usually i try to block weak group of my opponent and gain some territory or kill it, But here i have a problems with upper right white group. Please show me ways to kill upper right white group after 129 move. Thanks in advance!


Tom: My biggest question: why do you think you lost?  As I count it, white won by about 5 points.  Did you think black's group in the upper left is alive?  It's very dead, I put some variations at move 174.

So this has to be my first piece of advice: don't resign when you are winning!  Otherwise I tried to put some ideas on the opening that might help you.]

;B[lc];W[qj];B[cf]C[[K\]: Probably pincer here would better? But if w pincer then b will play something around f17, and it should be complicated game for white?

Tom:Pincer is fine. I like F17 more than G17 here.  G17 gives black more space to invade, and it's hard to make good use of a wall with only black stones in the area.]

C[[K\]: Here w groups nothing to affraid and b now has one weak and one unsettled group. Is it good moment for invasion? or it is better to attack weak group? I feel i have problems with timing.

Tom: I think attacking now is good.  Black made a mistake, allowing white to build a great wall to harrass the two black stones.]

Tom: I know it's difficult to get an accurate count in the middle of the game, especially if the time settings are faster, but let's take a rough estimate:
White:
Left side - 14 stones captured + territory, about 30 points
Right side - very roughly looks like about 35.
Total + komi: about 80 points.

Black:
bottom is quite large, maybe 60 points.
top left: 7 points
top center: 6 points
total: 73

This is only an approximate count, but if you have time to take a minute or even just try to guess by instinct, you should see that white is ahead.]
