(;B[qh]LB[pe:A]C[Trillian:
this peep only helps white because it results in a weak black group and a stronger white one. also it helps white to cut at A later ("doctor style": makes opponnent healthy). hane at o13 would be a better idea because white can make only small territory while black is building influence to build a moyo on the top (see variation).]
;W[qg];B[nd];W[mg];B[oj]C[joseki not really joseki with w haveing star on bottom? how should b play instead?

there is no fixed pattern in this corner-shape with white having a stone at r9.]

LB[qj:A]C[cant let w off to eays yet i dont liek my position.


Trillian: 
when black played the peep at o18, he said: "i want to cut whites stones". when the cut leads into an unfavorable position, you should better not start it.

there is a proverb saying: "first settle your own group, then attack". like this you have a very weak group but you're trying to attack whites strong groupe above.

later, white A reduces blacks eye-shape to nothing, threatening to connect to the white groupe above.]
;W[pn]C[i know why w plays here but is it bad? feel like i get let off easy sort of, but i do loose q6 and q 5 sente but l10 is huge


Trillian:
this white move is strong because it makes territory while attacking. you should always remember that the sense in attacking is NOT to kill but to make points while threatening to kill.]

(;B[kj]C[Trillian:
this move makes your own group to the right weaker. you don't need to strenghten L11 but your rightern group.]

;B[nm];W[im];B[jn];W[il];B[hp]C[try and make it hard on white, giveing me f5 for j 12 or somthign is too painful for white, so i hope to get the split with this move.]

(;W[io]C[TenSai: strong

we useally chat while we play, normally my oppent is very reserved felt he was feeling some pressure with this move.

Trillian:
i think this is a bad move, if black simply cuts. instead better variation, black will never get the whole lower side, so white doesn't have to worry]

but deicde i coudl kill a san-san invasion if i c 11...

Trillian:
no, you couldn't kill a san-san-invasion, as you saw in the game. but anyway, if you just keep everything around, it should be ok.]
;B[ci];W[nb];B[oc];W[mc];B[ob];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd]
(;B[be]C[Trillian:
there are rare situations where san-san doesn't live. i think in this case the white area is too big to kill. also there may be some aji concerning the black c9-c11-group. when you cannot read it out or are absolutely sure you can kill, you should simply play hane at c15.

trying to kill is too big a risk in this case, because if he lives, you have nothing. i think if you just shut in white in the corner, the game is still playable for you.]
