C[Hi. Thank you for reviewing my game. I thought the opening more or less went well for me. I ended up losing even though I don't see any blaring mistakes, so I'm not sure exactly where I went wrong. I've tried to write lots of comments so you can see my thought process. Not everything is a question, but I'd appreciate it if you could show where my thinking was wrong Thanks!

-- Hi Jonathan, this is Zoran Rilak aka wayward[2k\] @ KGS.  I'll be doing the review for Black as requested.  Please feel free to reply directly to zoran.rilak@gmail.com with any questions/comments/corrections you may have!]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dq];B[do]LB[cj:A][pj:B]C[I don't know any strategy for facing komoku, but I decided to play for influence, consistent with my two star points

-- This looks okay.  You could also go with A, or complete the san-ren-sei at B.  Facing komoku are too distant for White to map a significant territory with one, or even two plays on the left side, so any move on the left side should work for Black.]
;W[nq]LB[qn:A]TR[do]C[This surprised me since I thought the lower left would be more urgent. I tried to maintain influence here by forcing him into the corner.

-- You can't very well force White into the corner with a pincer play, since jumping out is a standard reply; actually, White had made a mistake by following your plan.  See variation for his next move.  As for Black, you can simply extend at A, letting White extend to the left and giving you sente to develop your marked stone.  See variation.]

(;B[lq]
(;W[qq]C[However, here I realized that if I made a wall by playing at R4, I would end in gote at n5 and he could play on the right side, thus making the wall weaker. Was this idea correct? I wasn't sure if that was good, so I decided to form a group facing the lower left and then play E3.

-- As a rule of thumb, if you force your opponent to play in an area where you are strong (right side after Black makes the wall), then you are in control of the game.  Observe:]

(;B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn]LB[om:A]TR[nq]
C[-- Black should follow up with A in this position, which is sente (see variation), especially so because this marked White stone is notoriously capable of breaking loose and wreaking havoc in Black's position.]

(;B[eq]C[This is what I planned. Was this a good idea?

-- Yes, works well with your opposing group.];W[er];B[ep];W[fq]
LB[cr:A]C[-- Such an overplay!  Joseki has White defending at A, but here he was obviously more concerned about preventing your moyo than with the safety with his own stones.  Let's see how to punish this.]

(;B[dr];W[cr];B[fr];W[ds];B[gq]LB[om:B][pn:A]C[I was hoping for this, but now it doesn't seem as solid as I had anticipated. This lower area is still very easy to reduce, so maybe it doesn't favor black so much?

-- White's overplay hasn't been punished, so he won a large corner.  Still, this is not such a bad outcome for Black.  A play at A by White or B by Black becomes very big.]
;W[cp];B[co]C[Trying to seal white into the corner];W[bo];B[bn]
;W[bp];B[om]C[I was nervous about white reducing this area after already getting the corners. Perhaps I was too concerned about making territory here instead of simply using the influence to build elsewhere. What should I have done?

-- This is good.  White can't sensibly reduce this moyo without getting himself attacked all over the board.  And, the move you just played is sente, so you're keeping the advantage.]
;W[qm];B[de]C[Sticking to center-oriented strategy];W[cg];B[cc]
;W[cb];B[cd];W[eb]
(;B[bb]LB[ci:A]C[I really didn't know what to do here. I want to build thickness/territory while attack the isolated stone at C13, but thought it would be bad to have this c16 group weak in the process, so I chose B18 to form a bit of space for an eye.

-- You're disrespecting your lower wall :)  How about this: if you pincer White from below while building territory against the wall, he will have to jump out, and then you will jump out, and then he will have two weak groups, and...  But wait, let's do it on the board:]
;W[cj]C[However, this let white make a base, so it didn't really help. What should I have done instead?]

(;B[cl]LB[fd:A]C[Limiting white's base, I thought, but he ignored it.

-- Your upper left group is looking weakish, squeezed between two White groups in good shape.  You can try to lean back against the top White group; see variation:]
;W[ba]C[b17 would just be heavy, so I ignored this];B[fe];W[gc]
;B[eg]C[This was a feeble attempt to put pressure on these white stones, but I don't think it was very effective. Any better ideas?

-- This does not work for two reasons:
(a) White can slide under at b15 to gain shape;
(b) if he runs out at e10, he'll be skimming the moyo we made at the bottom.

I would rather advance once again at h15, then turn around and cap at e10 myself.]
;W[ej];B[di]C[creating some aji];W[dj];B[bf]C[threatening his base while making one for me

-- good point];W[bg]TR[bf]C[-- Don't waste a move here -- as long as he can't capture your marked stone (which he can't), it's wiser for you to keep sente and develop your corner group by moving out while still attacking him.  A combination of h16 plus g10 is very active development and seems good for Black.]
;B[cf];W[el]C[-- Now White uses sente to move out, which is not good.  It is better to encircle a live group than to chase it out in an 'all-or-nothing' manner.]
;B[bi]C[-- I get it; you're thinking about killing :)  Don't try to attack to kill.  Attack to shift your opponent left and right while making your stones work together.]
;W[ci];B[bj];W[gk];B[gm]C[I tried to limit his expansion while starting to grow the bottom]
;W[fm];B[gn];W[nr];B[ns];W[no];B[nm]C[This seemed like the best way to keep him trapped in]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[ln];B[km];W[ms]
(;B[mr]C[I was afraid that he would cut at q6/7 and capture these stones, so I let him connect at the bottom and instead cut off the o5 stone. Was there a better play?

-- Yes, by connecting you actually deprive White of the cut; see variation.]
;W[os];B[np];W[ns];B[mp]C[Best defense I could find];W[kr]C[-- This is horrible, you've lost all your territory and White is nicely connected :(  It's a shame you let him take p1 as easily.  This result is so horrible for Black that you should have avoided it even if you didn't know how to play after stopping White at the bottom :)]
;B[kq];W[jr];B[jq];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr];B[ip];W[hq];B[hp];W[gr]
;B[fp]C[I played this whole sequence thinking that I should try to play a big move somewhere else, such as along the top side, but I didn't want him to connect to the m6 stones. This territory turned out to be fairly small by the end, so I didn't gain very much.

-- m6 stones have virtually no value in the game.  They are a dead weight, and they would still be dead weight even if there was thirty instead of three of them.  The reason is because they do not cut anything nor connect anything nor influence the status of the groups in the game in any manner.  The only important stones are ones that decide on the fate of the groups.]
;W[fs];B[gl]C[more feeble attacks];W[dh];B[mc]C[so, I left him alone and tried to simply maintain a territorial lead

-- You mean 'obtain a territorial lead', since you are a few points behind ;)]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[pc];B[rc];W[od];B[pe];W[oc];B[qe]C[the right side seemed to have more potential since he was not so solid in the top left and I had strong influence in the bottom

-- He is solid in the top left, but he is weak in the top right, and you have played in the proper manner: grip the offending stone and become solid, let White worry about his three stones.]
;W[kc];B[me];W[oe];B[mg];W[md];B[ld];W[nd];B[lc];W[le]C[-- This is a very panicky sequence by White.]

(;B[ke]LB[lf:A]C[-- Wrong side, I think; see variation.];W[lf]
;B[jc]C[trying to grip the stone and make a base];W[mf]C[-- You let him out too easily :)]
;B[nf];W[of];B[pg];W[ng];B[lg];W[kf];B[jf];W[kg];B[kb];W[pf]
;B[qf];W[bc];B[bd];W[ab]LB[qj:A]C[-- Just ignore this and take A.  Your group on the left can't make two eyes, so it will have to run away.  White can't attack it very severely with just one move, so let him have his prisoner and you take the large point on the side.]
;B[ae];W[bh];B[jg];W[kh];B[qk]C[-- A bit too close to White, but good thinking]
;W[ql];B[pk];W[rk];B[rj];W[rl];B[qi];W[pl];B[hb]C[q8 didn't threaten much, so I expanded my group while pressuring him

-- right];W[gd];B[ei]LB[eh:C][fi:B][hi:D][bk:A]TR[kh][bi][bj]
C[now I had more supporting stones, so i turned back to this white group

-- It can capture the marked Black stones at A, make shape at B, push out at C, or jump to D in the direction a friendly stone.  You can't really call e11 an "attacking move" :)  b9 would constitute an attack, forcing White to capture d11 or generally move out.]
;W[eh];B[fi];W[fh];B[gi];W[bk]C[i overlooked this, and now his stones were safe, so I cared less about the g11 stones

-- Right, it's a shame you played them in the first place, but things happen, and you're not emotionally attached to your stones which is good :)]
;B[bl];W[aj];B[hk]C[offering to trade the g11 stones in exchange for territory around k9

-- g11 stones are worth 8-10 points.  Can you make more than 8 points around k9?  With l12 on the board?  Nah, leave the center territory for last.]
;W[gj];B[hj];W[gh];B[gf]C[I was afraid he would cut off the d15 group and I only had one definite eye

SQ[ik][jk][kk][lk][il][jl][kl][ll]C[now this spot was enclosed, but maybe it wasn't worth losing the g11 stones?

-- It wasn't :)  You've played six stones in this area for eight points of territory, while White has captured four stones with a single move (h11, the d-h12 line of stones was forced).

-- You will gain a lot if you study some professional games for yourself (or even kifu from Shusaku period -- those games are an excellent tool for learning the direction of play).  Don't worry overmuch about capturing territory or saving stones during the game.  Focus on putting pressure on your opponent, making good shape and controlling the flow of the game.  Even if you start losing games in the near future, I am confident that if you focus on these areas, your skills will steadily improve.

One possible plan of action for Black is to build up a wall from the lower left stone, then combine it with an approach move against the d17 stone to map out a large area.  Ideally, while White is getting concerned about reducing that moyo, Black will be able to grab k17 for himself.]
