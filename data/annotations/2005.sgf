 Comments by Tomas Boman, (1D in sweden)];B[qp]C[tavan [8k\]: hi]
;W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[oq];W[pe]C[ A normal opening so far. Maybe white should have played around r10 instead because a black pincer now will work very well with the shimari in the lower right]
;B[pg]LB[ne:A][qc:B]C[ A or B is joseki]
(;W[nd]
(;B[nc]LB[pd:A]C[ I think that the sequence starting with A works for black]
;W[md];B[mc];W[ld]
(;B[fc]C[ This move can't be good for black. I would play f3 instead]
;W[ic]LB[hc:A]C[This move makes a bit funny shape in relation to m16. If white get to play m17 later then A would be better. Anyway, it's correct to pincer!]

(;B[kc]C[ If black really want to play here, then m17 is better, but I think that c17 is more important. White does not have any good move here anyway.]
;W[kd];B[lc];W[jd]
(;B[gd]C[ This is unreasonable. c17 looks like the only move]

(;W[pj]C[ No!
Locally, this is a good move, but the attack on the two black stones in the upper left is more urgent]

(;B[ql];W[pl];B[qk];W[pk]
(;B[qm]C[It is probably better to push at r10
 first];W[qj];B[ng]C[ This is unreasonable. Either f17/g16 or o13/q13 must suffer terribly]

(;W[jj]C[ This is maybe a bit loose. I would try to push black and then play a splitting move]
;B[qe]
(;W[od]C[ This is the first bad move from white. After r16 black has nothing to worry about]
;B[qd];W[oc];B[ob];W[og];B[pf];W[of]
(;B[oh];W[ph];B[qh];W[pi];B[jg]C[ Bad. Black set up a splitting attack against himself]
;W[he]C[Good!];B[nf];W[oe];B[hg];W[gf];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de]
;B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]
(;W[ce]C[Bad! This is aji keshi. Whithout this move, white can aim at playing b15 later on. Furthermore, white must make sure to get sente so that he can continue the attack on the center. This move looses a liberty which makes it harder to get sente.]
;B[be];W[df]C[ White is pushing from behind.];B[cg];W[dg]C[ Black has the chance to tenuki now]

(;B[ch]
(;W[di]C[ I think this leaves too much space for black]
(;B[ki]C[This is too greedy. Black must play more lightly]
(;W[lk]C[ This move can be good for containing the opponent, but at the same time it leaves a cutting point. l10 looks like the natural move]
;B[ij]C[ This is a good move. I don't know how white should respond]

(;W[jk]C[ This is a difficult fight. Maybe there is a way to kill. Black gets a lot of eye shape once he plays k11, so perhaps white should play there himself. I don't think white can afford to let black live.]
