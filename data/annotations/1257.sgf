C[bene: I am a previous 2k player in IGS. I will comment on principles, rather than specifics, believing it is more beneficial to you. Please acknoweledge my  possible misuse of English ^^;; . I am not very good at english term of go.

sencha: I have little idea how I wound up so far behind in this game.  Any comments
on what went wrong would be much appreciated.  I was Black in this game.]
;B[dq]C[      luka tells     sencha: likewise];W[pd]C[bene: I found you are very good at basics of go. I guess you have studied many go books. It will help you advance faster. However, your problems that i found includes..

1)  passive play style (inefficient moves)
2) insensitive attitude toward thickness  3) lack of judgement on winning situation or losing situation

i will explain it with your moves. and pointing your losing moves.]

C[sencha: this push seems good for Black, no?
bene: i agree, go books says it.];B[eq];W[go];B[hp];W[cp];B[cq]
;W[dg];B[fl]C[sencha: I'm happy with this.  I'm getting forth line territory, and White's wall isn't doing much.

bene: right.];W[ho]C[----------       sencha[ 7k\]  is now in byo-yomi, having 24 stones and 10 minutes]
;B[jp]C[bene: difficult, but i think j4 is more appropriate. j4-j5 then you can jump at l4]
;W[io];B[ip]C[----------       luka[ 6k\]* is now in byo-yomi, having 24 stones and 10 minutes]
;W[fj];B[hl];W[gk]C[sencha: And I really liked this push - I feel much more solid there now]
;B[gl];W[jo];B[kp];W[mq];B[lq]C[sencha: Appropriate attachment?  I wanted to think White was ending up overconcentrated.

bene: i dont agree here. this is solidifying white.];W[mp];B[ko]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[kn];B[ij];W[kl];B[il];W[jd]C[bene: here, it's time for you to stabilize your group. L9 move gave white thickness. just jumping at j12 dont allow eyes, and still weak.  my alternative is to press f10 group. specifically, at g11. G11 group is enough strong, so solidifying them is not much loss.]
;B[ck]C[bene: unnecessary, i think. It is solidifying white, while making no sure eyes for you.]
;W[cj];B[kk]C[bene: this move is allowing white thickness towards right side...]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[km];B[kj];W[mk]C[bene: judging here, white is more thick, and black leads in territory. white's thickness is a bit dominating, but because black is sente, the difference is small. Each party has one weak group. (white F10 group, black G8 group) but the black group is weaker..]
;B[qj]C[bene: good point];W[pl];B[qf]C[sencha: I'm told usually it's best to play the three point jump when it makes a kakari, but maybe it's bad here?  I feel like I'm ending up with two weak groups.

bene: you should be aware of thickness.. three point jump applies in fuseki situation. in fact, i play 2-point jump even in fuseki situation, to avoid invasion. Both are played by pros. However, Here white is too thick in center.
" play wide when you are thick", and "play narrow when the opponent is thick"

the first losing move.];W[qh];B[rh];W[ri];B[qi];W[rg];B[ph]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[rf];B[rj]C[sencha: Too soon?];W[sh];B[nj];W[nk]
;B[qq];W[qp];B[pr];W[pq]C[sencha: This seems like a mistake]
;B[rq];W[or];B[qs];W[rp];B[rr];W[oj];B[oi];W[ni];B[nh];W[mi]
;B[mh];W[li];B[pf];W[qe]C[bene: you should judge on winning/losing situation. here, you are lead by white's thickness. and you have two weak groups. you should stabilize each, but in an efficient way.
what is 'efficiency'? you should stabilize while destroying the opponent's territory, or attacking his group, or finding sure connection between your weak groups.  just passive living is a sure way to losing game.]
;B[hh]C[bene: i think this move is inefficient.  this is not making a sure eye, nor pressuring the left group, nor connecting to the other weak group.  this group is surely a burden, but not so weak. it has one eye in center, and can make another eye on left side.  i prefer stabilize the P11 group, while destroy white's territory near O16... after P11 group's sure life, this group is not a severe burden..]
;W[pj];B[kg]LB[pi:A]C[sencha: I'm trying to link up my two weak groups, because I'm worried about losing one of them in its entirety.  But maybe I should have connected at A?

bene: i dont agree here. if you lose R10 group, then you will lose the entire game. P11 group is not so weak; it can make eyes near O16 or R7.. even L13 is not allowing sure connection. you should connect A definitely.

the most severe losing move.];W[pi];B[oh];W[mf];B[lg];W[gc]
;B[ki]C[bene: because you are behind, you should be more active.. for example, sliding at B13. earning territory, making the white F10 group weak. now, because territory difference is large, the only way for you to win is to kill F10 group, or earning enough gain by attacking.
one of losing move.];W[mc];B[if]C[bene: again. while you invest several moves here, white is making big territories....  your L13-L11-K14 moves are just connecting and living (making little territories). white is making territories instead. the difference explains the results of this game.

you can surely live by moves near c7, or P16.. so this move should be at B13.
the last losing move.];W[bf]C[bene: by this move, you lost big chance..]
;B[be]C[bene: [concluding comments\]
you are very good at basics. your go skills will be greatly improve if you take an active playing style. don't just live; seek efficiency by pursuing multiple-use moves. for example, stabilizing while earning territories, or attacking the other...

your go skill will improve if you involve in more and more battles..]
