White have too much of the corner, and is also too heavy, leaving ample

Malveaux - I wasn't sure about this move.  I don't want Black to have the
whole bottom side. After B L3, is W L4 good?
Cherlin - Yes. The contact play at L3 invites fighting. L4 makes Black
create a heavy shape around 12 points or so of territory while White gets
outside thickness. worth much more.]WL[1720];B[jq]C[Pressing at b hems in
Black while giving White influence in the center and thickness to use
against the lower right corner.]BL[1716]

(;W[jc]C[Malveaux - I was not too sure about this either. Would
F14 or F15 or E13 or
something be better?
Cherlin - Yes, splitting Black is best. You should lean hard on the
stronger group, that is on the three stones on the upper left, and after
that you can kill the single stone at
F16]WL[1622];B[fe]BL[1654];W[gc]C[Malveaux - This feels like a mistake;
I regretted it right away. Pushes
Black into the corner?
Cherlin - No. White can live in the corner, and Black won't get territory
by invading. If you get a chance, F17 is a big move for
you.]WL[1602];B[el]C[Black would do better to mark out some
territory.]BL[1649];W[dl]WL[1587];B[dk]BL[1632];W[ck]WL[1538]
;B[dj]BL[1603];W[ek]C[Malveaux - Better at D11, or perhaps D7?
Cherlin - You should let the stone at E10 go. It may prove useful later,
but isn't worth the effort to save now. D7 is right.]WL[1523]

right corner first.]BL[1586];W[dm]C[
Malveaux - I wanted to play something like P17 or R14. But I feared to let
Black play C8.

you.]WL[1415];B[cq]BL[1578];W[dp]WL[1411];B[bq]BL[1575];W[bp]

attack on the bottom center, or an extension from R10 or
K17.]WL[1352];B[fj]BL[1538];W[bh]C[Malveaux - At this stage of the
game, what is best?
Cherlin - Either F17 or C14 secures your territory much better, but both
are gote and should be left for later. Take sente at the top, right, or
bottom.]WL[1340];B[ff]C[These are one and two point moves, while you are
neglecting 10 point moves elsewhere.]BL[1523];W[eg]C[Black has 20 points
at the bottom, and perhaps ten on the lower right, while White has  more
than 40 in tho group that runs around the left and top, and prospects for
much more. Black's wall in the middle is not worth much, but White should
spare a few moves to create central influence.]WL[1324];B[eh]

(;W[pl]C[Malveaux - Better at R6?
Cherlin - Q8 is certainly too timid, allowing Black to connect. R6 is too
bold. It would lead to close fighting in which Black would live and White
would gain little. Q6, however. would threaten to split Black in two
directions while maintaining solid contacts among the White
groups.]WL[1155];B[pm]BL[1354];W[qk]WL[1130];B[ol]BL[1353];W[pk]

someplace like N17?
Cherlin - If you want to prevent Black from forming a large moyo, a jump
from K17 is better. Perhaps L15 or K15 would be good, or an invasion
reaching out from N10.]WL[1047];B[nd]BL[1282];W[mf]WL[1031]

C[As I
said earlier, White should have played this attack sooner. Now the wall
which white will build surrounds a fixed territory, and cannot be used for
further attacks on the corner. However, this attack will allow White to
reduce Black's center moyo.]WL[979];B[ip]C[White has about 70 points of
territory around three sides plus the small group at the bottom. Black has
about 35 points in two groups on the edge, plus a moyo in the  upper middle
worth about 25. The vital fight is the Black moyo in the lower middle, not
the corner.]BL[1138]

veaux - I blundered. This should be at N3? Or better, I should have
played L2 instead of L6 on the previous move, I guess.
Cherlin - N3 is better than N2, but L7 is better still. On the previous
move, L6 is much better than L2, since it preserves a chance to invade the
center.]WL[777];B[mq]BL[865];W[mp]WL[726];B[nq]BL[837];W[nr]
