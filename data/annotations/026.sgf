TM[1800]RE[W+Resign]US[Brought to you by IGS]KM[5.5];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W
[dq];B[fp]L[co][do]C[Rob- I don't like this move much..If there was  thickness in the lower right corner, it would make sense, but as it stands,  I'd prefer c5 (a) or d5 (b).]
;W[co];B[jq]C[Rob- This is the best follow up..];W[dj];B[fc];W[cf];B[dh]
L[jd]C[Rob- This really should be k16 (a). A move like d12 is, I'd say, a  bit of a desperate measure right now..]
;W[ef]L[id][fh][dm][cl][eh]M[dh]C[Rob- I'd say j16 (a), here. If w f12  (b), or e12(e) to kill the marked stone, then you can invade at d7 (c)  or c8 (d). I'd probably prefer d8, as it threatens to link up underneath  with the marked stone.]
;B[fh];W[id];B[hd]L[db][ib]C[Rob- My sequence here would be d18 (a) then  j18 (b).]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[ic];B[dc]L[db][ge][cc]C[Rob- I like d18 (a)  better here. If w responds at c17 (c), then you have sente for g15 (b) or  so. If not, then you can live with c17 if you wish.]
;W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[ed];W[de];B[bg];W[bf];B[ej];W[ch];B[cg];W[ci];B[eg]
L[dg]M[cg][bg]C[Rob- I'd do the solid  connection at d13 (a) here. If w wants, he can start a ko for your 2 marked  stones. Not now, but at some point in the future..]
;W[he]L[ff]C[Rob-  Not a real good move by w. f14 (a) for b will connect, I think. That's bad  for w, b setles both weak groups too easily that way..]
;B[ff]C[Rob Good  move by b.];W[nc];B[lc]L[nd]C[Rob- This is an unreasonable move.  A pincer here is  difficult. Maybe o16(a), and attach and extend.]
;W[nd]L[ne][ld]C[Rob- Yow, way  too slow. I think w should o15 (a), or maybe m16 (b).]
;B[le];W[nf];B[jf]L[pf]C[Rob - I'd say the only move on the board for black, is  q14(a). Nothing else should be considered. it's that big a move.]
;W[gd];B[ee]L[dg][fe]C[Simon: this move was very bad.  If W defends his ataried  stone, I have a new weakness at a, and furthermore my two groups still aren't  connected.  I think f15 would have
been better.

Rob- I agree this was not a good move. f15 (b) would be better. Keeping  those groups connected is pretty large..]
;W[df];B[jb];W[hg];B[gf]C[Simon: the  purpose of this was to fix up the connection in sente.

Rob- Nice move.];W[hf];B[pf];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B
[nb];W[oc];B[mb];W[oe];B[pe];W[ph];B[og];W[nh]L[ng][mg]C[Rob - Not at all a good  move for w..He is inviting disaster.. Either o13 (a) or n13 (b) are  better..]
;B[ng];W[mg];B[mf]M[nc][oc][nd][oe][nf]C[Rob- w seems to chuck the marked stones  too easily.. :(]
;W[qn];B[oq];W[me];B[lf];W[pg];B[of];W[oh];B[pl]L[on][pn][re]C[Rob- Why not p6(a) or q6 (b) to develop the bottom ? You  have some nice potential there...More potential on the bottom for b than on  the right for w..Especially since s15 (c) is b's absolute sente..]
;W[on];B[nl];W[qf];B[qg]C[Simon: I'm not quite sure what this move  was for :-)  Descending would have been much better.

Rob-Yes, but even after w makes next move..];W[rf];B[ne]M[qf][rf]L[re]
C[Rob- You  should descend to s15 (a). You threaten the 2 marked stones and the  corner!]
;W[re];B[od];W[mn];B[mp]C[Rob - Yes! Good move..];W[ll];B[qi];W[qh];B[qm]
;W[pm];B[ql];W[qj];B[pj];W[pi];B[rn]C[Rob - Good move.];W[ro]L[dl][hi]
C[Rob- Frankly, a hard move to understand.. Perhaps d8 (a) or h11  (b).]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[rp];W[pk];B[ok];W[oj];B[qk];W[pj];B[mk]C[Rob-  A nice move by b to keep w disconnected..]
;W[jm];B[mm];W[nm];B[lm];W[ml]L[ln]C[Rob- W seems to throw some more stones.. Not a good move..W must push out  at m6 (a)]
;B[ln];W[jj];B[lk];W[kl];B[ki];W[kj];B[mh];W[ih];B[ji];W[ii];B[ij];W[hj]
;B[ik];W[hl]L[hi][il]C[Simon: I played 'a' for some strange reason.  The marked  stones could have escaped if
I'd played 'b' instead (variation 1), and this might have had dire  consequences for the  upper white group.

Rob- This analysis seems right..]
(;B[hi];W[hk];B[dg]C[Rob - A  very large move..];W[lg];B[lh];W[kg];B[jg]
;W[li];B[kh];W[mi];B[jh];W[bh];B[di]L[hb][hh][gg][hp]C[Simon: sente, building eye shape for this dodgy looking black group.

Rob- It does do that... h18 (a), would do that as well.. You also have  another eye with h12 (b) atari and g13 (c).. I'd say that group is pretty  safe, so I'd be considering a move like ....h4 (d)..]
;W[dk];B[cj];W[bj]C[Rob- Oops :)];B[cl];W[ck];B[dm];W[en];B[bo];W[bp];B
[cn]C[Rob- Wow..];W[bn];B[do];W[cp];B[bm];W[ao]L[hp]C[Rob- Wow part II.. Interesting  moves, I'd have thought you must run out here.. Frankly, I don't know that  this invasion is necessary.. If b just does h4 (a) or so, I'd estimate b is  up by 15 to 20 now..(at least)]
;B[em];W[ek];B[fn];W[ko];B[lo];W[ho];B[dp]C[Simon: hmmm.  I'm not quite sure what this move was for, either :-)]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[fr];B[gr];W[er];B[hq];W[gn];B[fo];W[fj]C[Simon: now I am forced to  make an eye, since there isn't much hope of getting two on the
upper edge.];B[hh];W[ig];B[gg]C[Rob- Nice job, I'd say this ends the  game.. b is clearly ahead..]
;W[gi];B[gh];W[eo];B[ep];W[kp];B[kq]L[lr]C[Rob I'd  have considered m2 (a).]
;W[lp];B[mo];W[lq];B[mq];W[lr];B[mr];W[js]C[Simon:   I rather think this should have been j1.

Rob - Yeah, no reason why not..];B[jr];W[kr];B[is];W[ks];B[lj];W[kk];B[ni]

;W[il];B[jo];W[kn];B[af]L[ir]C[Rob This seems to leave some nasty aji.. See  variation..]

(;W[ae]
(;B[ag];W[bd];B[ca];W[ba];B[da];W[ab];B[gm];W[hm]C[Simon:  this exchange left me with a nasty weakness at k4 which I missed.   Rob- The weakness had been there, though more subtly..]

C[Rob-  I don't understand this at all. w can just e12 (a) and kill your group :(]
;W[bk];B[jc]C[
 hobbes 24k*: has entering byo-yomi again

Rob- Oh no.. :(];W[eh]C[Simon: aargh.  How depressing.  I calculate the  score to be about B+20 points before this move.

Rob- Yes. I'd pretty much agree. You played quite well here, until the last  10 moves.. My only comment would be that you play a little too violently :)]

(;W[ir];B[hs];W[ip]M[im][in][io][jo]C[Rob- There are a couple of things that  work here.. Looks like b has to give up the marked stones.. :( Nasty aji  indeed..]
