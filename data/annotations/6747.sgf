C[I am black, ranked at 17k at the time by KGS (16k currently)

I am most interested in the opening. I am trying to improve the way I frame out the board and would really appreciate any advice in that area.

I am also interested in life/death situations. I know the shapes of living and dead groups, but I still have trouble playing key moves at the right time to form the shapes I need. If you have time please show variations that would have ended with me living.]

yup];W[qh];B[qi]C[once again, white's happy here.    you can even tennuki after r12]

;W[dg];B[cc]C[Later I wished I hadn't made this move, white's influence on the upper left got really hard to deal with, and he ultimately made a lot of territory with it

yes, not only that, k16 is weak and you dont need to push a white wall against it.]

it's a bit too early for this kind of invasion. this white formation is very difficult to cut.  but an invasion at X is probably better.]
