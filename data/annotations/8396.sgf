C[Pantherati,

You made lots of good moves.  It seems to me that the ones that were questionable were good locally, but less so given the whole board position.
Strategy can only be decided by making whole board assessments.  You have to have some idea of the score, even if it is only "that is about  the same size as that ..."

There are bound to be 2 or 3 points in the game (if not more) when you have to take the trouble to assess, and really that involves counting.  (It gets easier and faster with practice).   I have shown where I would do it.

Weak groups are important.  You avoided having any of your own, but missed the opportunity to make profit by attacking your opponent's.

Best of luck,

[fc:C]C[This is an unusual move.  Usual ones for this position are shown.  One point lower makes it significantly harder for White when he invades around R5.  The idea of a move around here is to threaten to make a moyo in both the top right or the bottom right.  But since the stone in the top right is 3rd line not 4th, this is not threatened.]
;W[ep]LB[cj:A][cl:B][cg:C][ce:D]C[This implies that you are aiming to make territory above this shimari; a knight's move enclosure at E3, or F3 would be my choice.  With this high shimari Black can invade the left side immediately at a, followed by white b, black c, white d - keeping up the pressure on Black's weak group.  This is not too bad for White, although the a, b exchange makes White overconcentrated there.  With that wall 3 points long (C4 and E4) you want your extension to be at C9.]
;B[cj];W[jd]LB[cl:A][ch:B][od:C]C[I think this should be at a, b or c.  Shimaris are obviously big moves at this stage; and you should take the opportunity to give Black a weak group.

The thinking behind this 8 is (I guess) to prevent a Black moyo and threaten to create a White moyo.  But Black has not played a high move, like the hoshi in the top right, so is not threatening to make a moyo.  And he has already invaded the left side: you cannot make a moyo.]
;B[jq]
(;W[hq]C[This is an important move, preventing black G3 and preparing for an invasion at, say M3.  But I still think it more urgent to pressure the Black stone in your sphere of influence on the left, as in the variations.  Weak groups matter.]
;B[mp];W[oc];B[pe];W[ne]C[Good idea];B[pc]
(;W[ob]C[An big move locally, but my first reaction would be to take sente and play the variation.  (Also, from the shape point of view, rather than territory, P16 is important for both sides.  This comes back to haunt you later).

This is the first of several times when you have to be prepared to take a local loss by playing a bigger move elsewhere.]
;B[cg]C[End of potential weak black group.];W[ef]C[Interesting idea, making a large moyo at the top, but now that Black has a STRONG group on the left, this only has one objective and is not effective enough.  Having missed the opportunity to pressure Black on the left, I would say that white C8 makes a better shape, and invading the bottom right corner is urgent.]
;B[gc]LB[qn:A]C[This exposes the weakness of this shape well, although I think it  is premature, and the bottom right corner should be completed before giving oneself a weak group.]
;W[ge]C[Hard to know how to respond: this seems a good choice.]
;B[jb]
(;W[ic]C[Normally it is bad shape to "push into a knight's move", and a large knight's move is similar, but the sequence coming up puts some pressure on the black group.]

C[Since Black cannot push through at "a", a white move here is not urgent: perhaps white at "c" next would attack better.  See variation.]
(;W[ec];B[lc];W[ld];B[kc];W[kd];B[mb];W[od]C[Yes - this is necessary in this shape.  But Black must not be allowed to invade this top area IN SENTE.   I.e. the white wall would be a good exchange for Black's territory at the top, IF White gets the next move.   It shows how important the white move at M17 was in the comment at move 29/30 is.]
;B[pb]C[This is not urgent now, and should be ignored, although it is a big move locally.]
;W[pa]C[This is end-game, and definitely is too small to play now. Black should ignore this and play a move to expand his moyo and reduce your territory in the centre, i.e. a move on the borderline between 2 large areas - always a huge move.]
(;B[qa];W[oa];B[qb]C[Also far too small to be played now.];W[og]
LB[cl:B][qn:A]C[Good move!  Black's small move at Q18 has handed you back sente, and you have done the right thing with it, and drawn nearly level again.  (Black's premature invasion at the top and White's lack of pressure on the left side are roughly equal mistakes then).

Let's look at the board as a whole, assessing territory and power.

TERRITORY
White's top left corner and Black's top right look roughly the same size, currently about 10 points.
At the bottom Black and White have roughly the same; but if we now add a move for each side completing the formations (R6 and C8) Black's formation is much larger.  (So simply playing these two big moves would be bad for White).

POWER
This is partly compensated for by White's greater power.  Only partly, as there is not much prospect of a weak black group to use it on.

So my assessment at this point is that you are a little behind still, due to not attacking the single black stone on the left in time.  Black's strong group there rather nullifies the thickness]
(;B[pg]LB[oj:A][eh:A]C[It is tempting for Black to want to hold on to the strip of territory along the right hand side, but pushing each other along the P and Q lines now makes White's central position suddenly in danger of producing sizeable territory - more than Black's to the right of that wall.  If Black ignored defending this point and played one of the suggestions shown, it would be too small for White to rubbish that territory with, say R13 immediately,   See variations.]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[oj];B[jh]C[Black certainly needs to worry about this area now.  My reaction to this is that it is a bit of an over-reaction - i.e. playing too close to strength, but admittedly, by crawling along the PQ lines, Black has given himself a bit of a problem.]
(;W[eh]C[Right idea, to cut him off, and if Black's group on the left were weak this would be good.  But it is not, so this move only attacks K12, not the group on the left.  So if Black responds by defending his central stone, 48 (E12) is only a move on a neutral point, not making territory or attacking.

So this is an occasion to "feint left and strike right", i.e. one should play a move that Black must answer on the left, or suffer a loss.  See variation.]
;B[gh];W[ej]C[Good];B[di]C[Good.];W[ei];B[jk]LB[po:A][qo:A]
[qn:A][jp:B][cl:C][be:D][kp:E]C[Time to make another whole board assessment, to decide on strategy.
TERRITORY
Black's has grown by the strip on the right, so instead of about 10, Black's top right corner is now around 22.  White's has not grown.  Without a good attack on the weak central Black stones W looks rather smaller - although undoubtedly there is profit to be made by attacking in the centre.  

A move for either side in the bottom right corner is still huge.

POWER
White has significant power in the centre, but now it can only really be used for making some territory, not attacking (as it should normally be used).  The stronger the black central stones become, the less significance the white power has.

STRAGETIES
W cannot really make any territory in the bottom right, although he can invade, perhaps Q5 or the others marked "a".  The result of such a sequence would probably be something like a strong W presence, but no significant W territory, whilst Black's territory in the corner and bottom is made secure.
W has to gain as much as possible by attacking the central stones.  He can perhaps gain an attack on them by putting some W stones in wait starting with b, but must not lose sente.
"c" (C8) is big territorially (but not so big as the bottom right) and may help in attacking the weak black group in the centre.

I think my choice would be to exchange c for d, b for e,  then invade the bottom right, whilst looking for an opportunity to attack the centre.]

(;B[be];W[bd];B[cl];W[dg]C[Good];B[ch]TR[co][do][eo]C[This highlights one reason why you are very short on territory: the white shimari in the bottom left should be used for making territory above it.   There is no white extension from it upwards.  The influence facing upward is now completely trashed.]
;W[jp]C[Excellent idea, to attack the central group.  Notice though that the exchange (started with W and ended with B so equal moves) on the left has left a little MORE support for the target group in the middle, unlike pressuring with WHITE C8.]
;B[iq]C[I think this is the wrong direction in that the white stones on JKL4 make the central stones weaker.  (I would play black L4).  But you could take the view that the central stones will survive, and this is the bigger territorial choice, and seals a black win.]

[nr:6][ns:6]C[Let's see how things stand now.

TERRITORY
Black's territory is now defined (apart from the centre), so can be counted quite accurately.
Lower right.
It is usual to count PAIRS of points.  At "1" a stone was captured, so that is worth a pair of points.  Working across systematically counting pairs: K1 has no obvious pair, so I "carry" it till the next oddment comes up. After 6, 7 is K1 and O3, along 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.  The more common method is to double at this point to count the territory there.  I prefer a slightly less common version, which is not to bother to double, and only reckon PAIRS.  Apart from missing out the doubling step for each area, I find the smaller numbers much easier to remember and add.
Top right - given that one can monkey-jump or something similar at the bottom, I make it about 12 (pairs) too.
Left - 5 or 6.  
Top - 2 or 3.
So Black - 12, 12, 8 = 32  
I try to count the territories in size order, starting with the largest, and remember the values of at least the larger ones, so as to save time for the next count, or to assess whether an area has got larger etc.

White.  I'm just going to count it all together, including a few places stuck to the strong walls.  I make it about 18.

32 compare 18: you need to make another 14 (pairs) of points of territory.  Can you see anywhere big enough, if you put in some generous lines of stones to make that much?  Suppose you had a row of white stones along the L line? I can't see you getting that many, but you might get close, and he may make some mistakes.  

As well as moves around the central black group making territory, B7 is a huge end-game move for you.  The difference between that and Black getting B5 looks like a good 12 points in double sente.]

C[Again he has ignored your last move, so see if you can make capital out of that.  If you pushed at "a" instead it would stop the capture of H7 AND it would make white L9 sente, sealing off your new territory.

Try estimating what new territory you can make with your new sketched out walls.  Does it come to 14 (double) points?
