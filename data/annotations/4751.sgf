AB[pd][dp]C[This is my first game which will be reviewed here. I would be gratful for coments which move was good too.

---

H: Hi, I'm Hannes and will review for black.

Summarizing, I'd say, that black played his part quite well in several ways:

1)  Not engaging in early fights (even white did approach aggressively) is surely the right choice.

2) The influence towards the center was evenly divided between b and w.

3) Following the "corner first, then extensions (edges), then the center" proved to be a good strategy.

The points, that b should (in my opinion) concentrate upon are:

1) Avoid the diagonal one-space jump (elephant's jump) unless you have checked the possible outcomes.

2)  Don't be too afraid of cutting stones. Check, whether they are  dangerous at all.

3) If under attack (contact moves etc.), take your time to look for moves that are more valuable  than the loss you get by not responding immediately to the attack.

4) Avoid unnecessary moves

5) In close combat: Keep an eye on liberties, and be the first to attack, if you and your opponent have the same number of liberties.

6) In two situations, you played forcing moves (i.e. white has to respond in a predictable way), that forced white to play where he already wanted to play. In doing so, you help your opponent.]
;W[nc]C[H: Even though it's true, that w has to play aggressive in handicap games, I wonder why he did not get for at least one corner. 
However, b does the right thing...];B[qf]C[H: ...by simply extending the corner.]
;W[fq];B[cn]LB[qf:B][cn:A][dq:C][eq:E][dr:D]C[H: Following the same idea here, w ends with two weak and lonely stones. So he has to decide whether he keeps on attacking or whether to strengthen his stone.

A and B are good moves. However, one thing to keep in mind is that A and B do not secure the corner territory. They  are influence-oriented.  To make secure territory, at least one more stone like C,D,E has to be played.]
;W[kc];B[pp]LB[kc:A][pp:B][qp:D][pq:C]C[H: White A lost him sente, i.e. now it is w that will have to respond to b's moves.

H: With B, black chooses the 4-4 again. This is not wrong, but I would have preferred at least one more stable corner, and would thus have played C or D. But that's a question of your personal preferences.]
;W[nq]
(;B[qn]LB[pn:B][qn:A]C[H: Again, nothing wrong with A. I might look passive compared to B, but see the variation, why A is preferrable.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[dr];B[cq];W[ci];B[dd]LB[dc:D][qc:A][cd:C][dd:E]
[cq:B]C[This move gave me 8 points only, but I read that corners are important, and it reduced W moyo.
Or should I play somewhere else? or different point in this corrner?

H: I would again go for C/D instead if E. One characteristic of the 4-4 corner is, that you let your opponent choose, in which direction this corner will evolve. But keeping this in mind, there's nothing wrong with E.

By the way, there is no white moyo, yet. But going for corners first, is exactly what you should do here.]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[hc];B[fe]LB[bd:A]C[H: Good move. The other possibility (A) would have given you around 15 points, but now you have access to the center.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[cl];B[el]LB[dm:A]TR[cn]C[I have doubts about this move, I don't like it much.

H: You're right. The two marked stones are sometimes called an elephant's jump and you probably know that jumping is something, an elephant is not very good at.  :-)

The problem is A, which splits the two black stones.];W[pr]
;B[qq];W[iq]LB[pp:A]C[H: This is a good example, for the peculiarity of the 4-4 corner (at A). White makes black respond and gets his two groups on the left and right play nicely  together.

But b can do the same on the left side, so it is a fair result here.]
;B[go]LB[go:A][lq:B]C[With this move, I think E8 likes better.

H: The problem of the elephant's jump is still there. But, of course, A reduces whites influence to the center while making b's potential territory bigger.

Another idea would have been B, splitting white's groups.];W[no]

(;B[on]LB[qi:B][qj:A]TR[qn][pp]C[Is it good move?
Or would be better to play round Q10(I mean expand along right edge)?
But overall it gave me quite good results.

H: First of all, the marked stones make good shape and b is now stronger in direction of an invasion around A or B. So it is a good move, indeed.

See the variation  of moves 30 and 31 for your second question]

(;W[io];B[im]LB[dm:A][hn:B]TR[go]C[H: The elephant's jump again. Now the black group is vulnerable at A and B.]
;W[mm];B[nl];W[lk];B[mj];W[ki];B[lh];W[jg];B[kf]LB[jg:A][ki:B]
[lk:C]C[H: I have no idea, why white continues this knight's moves till A, B, and C. Black gets a big moyo. White get's nothing, as the line of stones can be cut almost everywhere.

Well done by black.];W[kn];B[kl]LB[ej:D][kj:A][lj:B][ik:C]C[H: I wonder, what b had in mind here. If it was for cutting, A or B would have been better. If it was for territory,  C or D would have been more profitable.]
;W[qb]
(;B[rc]LB[rb:A]C[H: This move is all right. It's also possible to respond with A. See the variation.]
;W[kq];B[hp]LB[ip:A][hq:B]C[This looks empty, didn't give me anything.

H: well, white has to decide which cut he wants to defend (A or B), so you can play the other, making w's territory smaller. This is quite good for black. But note the next comment.]
;W[hq];B[ip];W[gp];B[ho];W[jo];B[in]LB[fo:A]C[White A would have a terrible result. (see variation), so it *must* be defended first, before doing anything else.]

(;W[jp];B[jn]TR[im][in]C[H: Unneccessary move which gives white sente again.

The marked stones' shape is called an "empty triagle" and should be avoided whenever possible.]
;W[bc];B[cb];W[ef];B[ff];W[cr];B[bq];W[ne];B[of];W[qr];B[rq]
LB[mf:B][ej:A][hk:C][fo:D]C[H: This corner struggle is just about very few points. There are much bigger moves for black, like A, B, C
(and D, of course)];W[gb];B[fb];W[bm];B[bn];W[br];B[eq];W[er]
;B[fp];W[gq];B[eo];W[bb];B[ce]LB[ce:A][ej:B]C[Prabobly this and next my move made that W cut me to center. They gave me nothing.
Maybe it be better if I played E12 and E10?

H: The problem is, that black A forces white to play, where he already wants to play.  E10 (B) is still a big move, and would surely have been better, here.]
;W[be];B[df];W[eg];B[fg]LB[fg:A][ej:D][hk:F][ik:E][el:B][im:C]
C[H: Again, I think, that A is not really important, as you have B and C with influence into this empty territory.
D,E,F would have been more valuable.];W[cg];B[eh]C[would it be better at F12?

H: Yes. But F12 is not as good as the others, which extend the lower black group.
Again, you make white play, where he already wants to play.]
;W[dg];B[de];W[ee];B[ed];W[fh]LB[eh:D][fh:A][gh:C][fi:B]C[This is first cut which give me troubles.
And I didn't know how to respond.

H: You have basically three choices: Pushing white A with B or C. Or: extending from black D.]

(;B[gh]C[H: This move pushes white into the empty space where black wants to extend his territory from below. Not the best choice.]
;W[fi];B[gi];W[ei];B[fj];W[dh];B[ej];W[dj];B[ek]
(;W[gg]LB[eb:A][ff:B][gg:D][gi:C][hk:F][ik:E]TR[da][ea][db]
[dc][ec]TW[eh][di]TB[ep]C[Second cut.

H: Two comments here:

The first thing to note is that  the marked group is not yet alive as it does not have two eyes. (see variation in move 97)

See variation on move 98 to see, how this could be solved


Secondly: The cut is not dangerous itself, as it cuts group B from group C, which both belong to different groups. So D is a cut, but it does not really cut something off. You might as well ignore it and play E or F instead.]

(;B[hg]C[H: This gives w a new potential cutting point, So you should read carefully, whether this is a good approach.]
;W[gf];B[ge];W[hf];B[he];W[if];B[ih];W[gj]C[Third cut.

H: Not attacking white directly would have been a better choice (see variation)]

(;B[hj];W[gk];B[gl];W[hk];B[ik]TR[gi][hj]C[H: A double hane is almost never a good move (as it has too many cutting points). Here, it is wrong and white could have killed blacks stones instantly.]

;W[li];B[mi];W[mh]C[With this cut I handled somehow, but he didn't play good.]
;B[mg];W[nh];B[oi]LB[nf:B][ng:A][ph:D][oi:C]TR[of][qf]C[H: There are three dangerous things, you have to defend against:
1) white connecting to another group (via A and B)
2) white cutting off parts of your group (does not apply here, as both halves of your group are alive).
3) white getting a living group inside your own.

Number three is most important here, and aIthough C is not wrong, I would play D here, which would make good shape with the marked stones]
;W[nf];B[ng];W[oh];B[og];W[ph];B[qg]TR[of][qf][og]C[H: Good move. Good shape and preventing white to use the edge]
;W[qh];B[qi]LB[pi:A]C[H: This one is very dangerous, as white A would split the blacks.

This does not mean that white will succeed, but it will become a hard fight, and the result will most probably decide the whole game.]

H: You will find this situation quite often at the edges (especially in end game moves), so be aware of this shape. 

In in this case it does not help white to make his group alive, so it's no real problem here.]
;W[rm]LB[ph:A][qj:B]C[H: But let us count liberties: blacks B group has 3 and whites A group , too.
