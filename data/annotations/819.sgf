C[Hi!
 This is a tough review as there is  so much to comment on. I would like for  you to send it to your opponent to as I  made comments on both sides. You  did win the game by 50 pts so it is  strange to get a game like this to  review. You should send games you  lost preferably by a small margin (up to   15pts at your level) basicaly games  you do not know what went wrong. I  hope this review helps and be sure to  check my comments at the end of it.   Enjoy!

(;W[qk]LB[fq:A]C[This is a mistake. As white is a move  behind LowCh. is a bad strategy. This  lets black keep the advantage of the  first move for a longer period of time.  White should have made an approach  move at the bottom side.]
;B[nc]C[Correct.];W[pf];B[jd];W[jq]C[Again white is trying to compete with  black in moyo but since he is a move  behind it will not turn out good for him.

As to shape - white should play this at the  4th line.]
(;B[mq]C[BAD! This goes against every principle  of go i know.
1. Black made an invasion in the  oppening which cannot live on its own.
2. Black invaded white's smallest  territory.
3. Black is ahead so invading is bad.
4. Both white stones on the bottom are  on the third line. This calls for an  erasing move not a invasion.
5. Black just created a target for white  to attack.
etc....

Never make such moves. All in all I'd  call this the loosing move.]
;W[oo]C[Good. Usually white should attack from  the other side but with his corner stone  on the third line this is best.]
;B[lo];W[kp]C[Good.];B[jj];W[jn]C[should W have cut in M4 without  waiting ?

No this is great for white. Cutting him  would enable black to sacrifise his  "Bad" stone and gain something from  it.]
;B[lm];W[fp];B[eq];W[fq];B[dn]C[Good - white stabilized his group.]

(;W[fm]LB[kl:A]C[Mistake. White should continue to hunt  black via  A. This just adds territory and security  to a secure group.]
;B[ho]C[Bad...];W[gn];B[om];W[mn];B[ln]
(;W[lp]C[Bad. Black whole group is in danger so  he will not have time to connect this  stone. Cutting it away helps black to  settle his group.

see var.];B[mm]C[Good!]
(;W[mp]LB[mo:A]C[If white wants to play here than A. But  playing elswhere is better. see var.]
;B[oi]LB[pi:A]C[A would be more severe as it would  attack the r9 stone directly.

Black is back in the lead...
Learn to play moves like the black  marked stone...];W[cf]C[I thought I need to go quickly in the
upper side before B closed it, but was  it really a good move ? I have some
doubts since I had difficulties to create  a leaving shape.

Living should not be a problem...
The usually invading at the wider/more  open side is naturall. Left is  wider but the top is more open  so playing this at the top would be  better...]
;B[ce]C[May be I'd better not answerd C15 and  play F16

No. answering this is o.k. you should  have played at the top before...]
;W[df];B[fd];W[dh];B[ci];W[ch]LB[gg:A]C[Bad - this should have been at A.]

;W[hh];B[hj];W[gi]LB[gg:a][jh:b]C[this was not good : maybe a or b were  better

A is the best - try to settle your group  quickly. If you keep on running you will  be taking dame points while black  makes territory....]

(;B[eg]C[Wrong, see var.];W[gg]C[White almost alive...];B[im]
C[Good move!];W[in];B[hn]C[Excellent. Adding to the sacrifise - get  at least some forcing moves out of the  bad placed stone...]
;W[hm];B[jm]LB[hl:A]C[A losses nothing so black should have  A.]
;W[jo];B[qi];W[qm]LB[qn:a]C[maybe a was better to close the lower  side but I did not want to risk to lose
the center right

D6 was even better... As to the center  white cannot hope to connect at the  upper right so this doesn't affect him...]

(;B[qc]C[Correct idea but see var...];W[qd]LB[pc:A]C[Since the marked stone is this close A  is the only move....]

You both should study your endgame  as there were many mistakes there.  Furthermore try to think about your  stones as groups and not focus so  much on the territory. With safe groups  territory will come natural. Hope this  review helps.
For black he should also study  handling of corners as he lost the  game on thouse (lower and upper left).

hope you like it....
