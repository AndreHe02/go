C[[Kim\] ~   Hi, thanks for checking out my game. Final score was very close .
              I felt i let it get out of hand and could have easily lost it if i made endgame errors.
              Looking for ways that i could have solidified the win

[GB\] Hi, I inserted my comments in the game, I hope you find them helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions. You can reach me at gbohus@yahoo.com]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[cp];W[pc];B[eq];W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[bc]C[[GB\] interesting ... I coulnd't find it in Kogo's Joseki dictionary and it doesn't look good. Luckily W chose to do the wrong thing 8-).]

(;W[cd];B[cc];W[cj];B[qe];W[qd];B[pe]C[[Kim\] ~   Is this extension correct?

[GB\] I think it is. White's R16 wasn't so great, in fact it's only used when there is white lower on the right hand side.]
;W[ph];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[pd]C[[GB\] very bad -- there is almost never a reason to make an empty triangle, exept in the endgame, of course.]
;B[ne]C[[GB\] good];W[rd]C[[GB\] I would probably tenuki. This area is not going to belong to anyone, both players are present.

There is lot's of empty room left on the board.]
(;B[qh]C[[Kim\] ~  Maybe  Q 10 better?

[GB\] yes, but tenuki is even better.];W[qi];B[qg];W[pk]

(;B[qp]C[[GB\] R3 is more solid]
(;W[qo];B[rp];W[ro];B[lq];W[gq]
(;B[fr];W[gr];B[jd]C[[Kim\] ~   Too loose?

[GB\] This is fine and it creates a nice moyo.];W[hd];B[hc]
;W[id];B[ic];W[jc];B[kc];W[jb];B[kd];W[gc];B[gb];W[gd];B[hb]
;W[fd];B[ec];W[cm]C[[Kim\] ~ I felt happy with the opening, Should i have been more ahead since i was black?

[GB\] Actually, I'm not quite sure that you are ahead. White's last move is quite big.]

(;B[bf]C[[Kim\] ~ This was to add some complication to his west wall for when i pushed into the centre. is it a mistake  for white to answer this? I think i got lucky that he didn't take D15

[GB\] I think the right spot to attack the left hand side is at C12. See variation.]
;W[bg];B[de];W[ce]
(;B[eg]C[[GB\] since it is likely that you are not going to catch those five stones, attacking them from the right might be a better idea, since that way you can make yourself some territory.]
;W[hg];B[gf];W[hf];B[ge]C[[Kim\] ~  This sequence was bad for me. i was trying to make white heavy while i pushed down, but instead just have them thickness. also looking for a cut.]
;W[gg];B[he];W[ie];B[ff];W[if];B[ch];W[bh];B[ci];W[bi];B[dj]
C[[BG\] playing around here won't help you much, since the area is wide open. Something like B6 is bigger.]
;W[ck];B[bn]C[[GB\] good];W[bm];B[nb];W[qb]C[[GB\] not very important to defend.]
;B[pi];W[oi];B[pg];W[oh];B[ri];W[qj];B[rj];W[rk];B[oj]C[[BG\] what is the purpose of this move?]
;W[pj];B[nn];W[ji];B[pm]C[[BG\] hmm. how is this not going to get cut?]
;W[om];B[on];W[qm];B[nm];W[pl]
(;B[jr]C[[GB\] this is greedy. L2 is a good move, but even that is perhaps too early.]

C[i tried to keep sente and take the bigger points in endgame which may have saved the match for me

[GB\] the idea is correct of course. the order is not the best. A couple of moves that are bigger I think: C8, T5]

C[[GB\] this is small and can be answered at A15 in which case you have to defend at some point.]
;W[af];B[ac]C[[GB\] worth zero points, right. you can do that anytime.]
