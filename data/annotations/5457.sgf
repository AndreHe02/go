C[Hi, I'm playing black in this game. I think I was doing fine until my moyo on the left side was destroyed, and I found it difficult to make enough territory. My playing style emphasizes tactical manouvers, so to balance things out, I'd like to hear mostly about the direction of play and about big points on the board in general. Comments on tactical matters are, of course, also much appreciated.

Thanks for your review!

Hi];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[ec]C[Usually, in this position, black don't answer localy (too slow), but play in the last free corner.]

I can see now that my play was very inconsistent at this point and I thought that I could benefit more from getting to play G3, which didn't give me quite enough compensation after all.

Yes, H6 is better]

S15 is better because there is 2 aims with it : territory and attack against white R14-Q11]

There is problem with R8...

no benefit but black lose some points here  ; and it's not the time to do so because black advance in not so comfortable now...

This game is typically a won-game losed.
(see GoSeigen "Winning a won-game" Yutopian enterprises)

To improve your game :
1. Count the game twice while playing (in the middle game to catch the good moment to start the yose, and during the yose itself).
2. Study yose serriously.
3. Never play moves without to have a good reason ; you probably lose more than 10 pts with that kind of moves : 127 & 161.
