C[Black: Tuhkelo [14k\]

;W[iq]C[krv: Seems like locally H3 is better.];B[nq];W[oq];B[np]
;W[pn];B[cn]C[krv: I like here K5, D10, J16];W[fp]C[[gunzler\] Is White at risk of becoming overconcentrated when he already has J3 in place?

krv: No. Seems like white shape is balanced very good now. That's why I don't like C6.]

(;B[bp]C[krv: Not sure, but may be C3 is better.];W[cq];B[ck]

(;W[io]C[[Tuhkelo\]: I needed to strengthen my weak group on the lower
side, but I didn't want to get shut in, so I decided to try something on the right side instead of playing at K2. Maybe the sequence bK2, wJ2, bL5 is okay for black?

krv: Play simple L5. K2 you can always play later, if you want. But I don't like this shape.]

(;B[po]
(;W[qo]C[[gunzler\] Black Q5 must be an overplay, no?  How should white deal with it?
krv: I think P5 is good, but R5 is good too. If you are sure what you are doing, then play P5, if not (or if your advantage is big and you want avoid complicated fight) then play at R5]
;B[pq]
(;W[op]
(;B[or]C[krv: Seems like overplay.]
(;W[qq];B[pr];W[qr];B[oo];W[qp]C[[Tuhkelo\]: I guess black could now play K2 in sente and then
come back to secure O5?

krv: K2 is bad shape. Better L5]
(;B[no]C[[gunzler\]  I have to say I felt something had gone wrong in the last few moves.  I was more interested in attacking black than securing the corner per se, and he was starting to look solid.

krv: Let's count (see next move comment).]
(;W[mr]C[[Tuhkelo\]: This move was really horrible for black. Now there
is no base and the whole sequence on the right has lost its meani]
;B[nr];W[kr]
(;B[jr]C[[Tuhkelo\]: I was shocked and couldn't think straight. This move
didn't help me at all, because if I tried to climb out with these
stones, white would have got a frightening double attack against my two weak groups.

krv: I like this move, but don't like the next.];W[lq]
(;B[ko];W[kp];B[lo]C[[Tuhkelo\]: This move was supposed to threaten something, but
I can't find any effective variations when I look at it now.

krv: yes, white can don't answer.]
(;W[jq]C[[gunzler\] This seemed unexpectedly good to me, no black eye shape.]
;B[kl];W[ic];B[qh]C[[Tuhkelo\]: Here I was hoping to make white defend his side territory so that I can help my weak center group in the process. I'm not sure if this was correct thinking, but it turned out very well for me I think.

[gunzler\]  I think so too. I wanted to solidify the side so I could keep attacking, but made a bad choice, and then played away.  I've added what I think ar two better choices.]

(;W[qi]TR[ol][pl]C[[gunzler\]  This doesn't really help.
I even considered following with a reinforcing move at one of the triangles, say, but that felt really slow and overconcentrated.

krv: S10 is better.];B[ph];W[mc]C[[gunzler\] Discussing the game after, I was sort of surprised I made this move.  It seems silly, the whole point of J17 being that playing on the left or right are miai so you *don't* have to waste a move in the area.

krv: This is slightly overplay. I'd play here, but M17 or F17 to establish a base. This shoud be enoug to win.]
;B[qk]TR[ol]C[[gunzler\] The next few moves are bad for white, black settles his group below and white gets nothing. (I can't figure out how to remove the triangel.)]
;W[ri]C[[gunzler\] For some reason I wasn't worried about black getting out..  Can't say why.]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[nl];W[rk];B[gc]
(;W[ql]C[[gunzler\] I don't think this was necessary, I was just unable to let go of the area.]
;B[kb]C[[Tuhkelo\]: Maybe blocking at S12 first might have been better.

krv: No. This move  is the good way to punish white.];W[kc]
;B[mb]C[krv: M18 or K18 first.];W[lb];B[la];W[lc];B[nb];W[jb]
;B[hb]C[[gunzler\]  Given how many moves I let black take here, this looks good for white.  If I'm right, what should black have done to take full advantage?

krv: Black gain very much here. White have the group with no territory and black secures two corners.]
;W[od];B[pd];W[nc];B[pb];W[rg]C[[Tuhkelo\]: Now the black stones at R12 are quite useless for
black. I didn't think of it during the game, but maybe I could
have still used them to attack the white group on the top side.
The group had grown so big that attacking it seemed unprofitable, but maybe I should have put more pressure on it by building some thickness on the right side. That would have helped me later to eliminate any white territory forming in the top center.]
;B[oe];W[og]C[[gunzler\]  I think this was probably unnecessary.  At most it captures two stones, but I didn't think anyone was going to attack anything or surround  territory in this area anyway.]
;B[dg];W[ce]C[[gunzler\] A day late and a dollar short?

krv: I don't think this is the right way to invade. May be C17?]
;B[cd];W[cg]
(;B[ch];W[df];B[dh];W[bh];B[bi];W[ff];B[ed]C[[Tuhkelo\]: Some kind of double attack around G15 might have been more efficient than this. I was aiming to cut at E14, but white had the reply at F16 which I hadn't taken into account.

[gunzler\]  I'm not so comfortable with F16.  It means an exchange, which I guess is something I should get used to.]
;W[he];B[ef];W[ee];B[eg];W[fd];B[de];W[fc];B[fe];W[ge]
(;B[ec];W[fb];B[eb]C[[gunzler\] It feels like black got more, but that's because I wasn't worried about the M17 stones, and maybe I should have been.]
;W[ea];B[da];W[fa];B[cb];W[gd]C[[gunzler\]  Should this have "taken ko" on general principles? I can always come back and take G16 or G14 if I don't want to fight over the ko later, but G16 seems so much more likely..

krv: To take a ko is slightly better.];B[en];W[bf]C[[gunzler\] This was just greedy.  Save for ko threats, or something. I guess it shows I really thought I had lost in the exchange, and couldn't let go.

krv:  Don't answer at all.]
(;B[be];W[bd];B[cf];W[ok];B[im]C[[gunzler\]  I've now let black play twice in a row making the moyo on the left huge.]
;W[hi]C[[gunzler\] I was actually more worried about this black moyo swelling out than surrounding territory of my own, since he seemed to have entries to the center at both L8 and O15 and you can't patch both at once.]
;B[bq]C[[Tuhkelo\]: After playing here I began to realise how important
it was not to let white make a wall around O15. I decided to
play there next, but as it turned out I was just a little late.
I thought B3 threatened to destroy the white moyo on the lower
side, but I had miscalculated. This was a crucial moment in the
game.]
(;W[nd];B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[mg]
(;B[oh]C[krv: I'd sucrifice these two stones.];W[nh];B[pf];W[ni]
C[[gunzler\] I'm pretty happy, because I've surrounded more than expected and black has spent a lot of moves capturing one stone. S13 means that he hasn't taken even a little real territory.
I think I took a quick count here, assmuing black gets a line from E11 to E7 and white gets H13, K11, and M11.  That makes it close.]

(;B[eq]C[[gunzler\] Should this have "worked"?  If not, was there an invasion here that would have been better?

krv: See count. You don't need any invasion. You must protect your own points of invasion.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[eo];B[do];W[fo];B[cp];W[er]C[[gunzler\] Black got a little out of this, but much less than I was afraid of after not answering B3.]
;B[ki]C[krv: Better M11 (aiming to cut and closer to base M8-P8)]
;W[ll]C[[gunzler\]  Ok, maybe I counted here, or remembered what I had just concluded.  L11 is too far, in that I lose if I just let black exchange walls there.  Besides I read out that H11 and O11 were "ladder breaks" for the most worrying continuations.]
;B[lk];W[kk];B[jk];W[kj]
(;B[lj]C[krv: I like more K10];W[jj]C[[Tuhkelo\]: Now I guess it's best to push first at J10 and J11
and then connect at K8. M8 can't escape anyway. I didn't realise this during the game though.

krv:I like J9]
(;B[lm];W[jl];B[km];W[li]C[[gunzler\] To here, I am happy, I have cut off L11 and established a border I have a chance of winning with.]
;B[ik];W[ij];B[il]C[krv: Why not H9?];W[hk]C[[Tuhkelo\]: White has made a huge profit in the center.]
;B[fk];W[fm]C[[gunzler\] Again, F9 is a bit farther than I could afford to let black go comfortably, so I found myself following him around the board, which I know is supposed to be bad.]
;B[em];W[fi];B[gj];W[hj];B[gi];W[gh];B[fh];W[fg];B[eh];W[hh]
C[[gunzler\]  When I realized I had to come back and protect here, I felt things had gone badly, black had pushed the border too far in this area.]
;B[rh];W[ne]C[[gunzler\] I think this was a bad exchange, I was just trying hard not to follow black around all the time, and I knew his follow-up was big but gote.]
;B[si];W[sj];B[sh];W[of];B[pe];W[gk];B[fj];W[fl];B[el];W[ol]
;B[nm]C[krv: small];W[br];B[ar];W[cr];B[hn];W[ho];B[gn];W[fn]
C[[gunzler\] Bad choice, I knew those two stone could connect out the other way, I'm not sure what was in my head.]
;B[go];W[gp];B[in]C[krv: Last four black moves are useless.]
;W[nk];B[mi];W[mj]LB[lh:A][li:C][mk:B][ml:D]C[[gunzler\] I don't know why I thought this was ok.  I was very lucky that black reacted as though I knew something he didn't. The idea was black A, white B, black fills, white connects cutting him off, but that just doesn't work.

[Tuhkelo\]: If black A, white plays D and that's it.];B[ml]
;W[mh];B[om];W[pm];B[ka];W[mk]C[[gunzler\]  Again, me trying hard not to just follow black around one step behind.  It didn't work, I didn't notice the cut at J18.  Should just have blocked him, then he would have gote. I think I lose a point in this sequence.]
;B[ja];W[ia];B[ma];W[ib]C[[gunzler\]  No, two points.  Both J19 and J18..]

(;B[ll]C[krv: 1 point gote.];W[jo];B[jn];W[oi];B[pg];W[lp];B[mp]
;W[ns]C[[gunzler\]  I realized I should have started on the other side. But I didn't.]
;B[qs];W[rs];B[ps];W[rr];B[on];W[ee]C[[gunzler\]  I felt behind.  I think we both did.]
;B[lh];W[mi];B[fe];W[pc];B[qc];W[ee];B[nf];W[ng];B[fe];W[oa]
