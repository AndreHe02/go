;B[pd]C[This game was reviewed by Steven Mays on May 8th, 1995 for Dahua.]

C[The invasion is too early. There are still big points to be played on the  board (e.g., at 'a' or 'b'). Besides, now your stone at F3 becomes a target  for White.]
;W[eq];B[iq];W[jq];B[fp];W[ip];B[hq];W[dn];B[cq]M[fq]L[jd][fc]C[Your invasion at the marked stone and your invasion at  the  3-3 point is too early. The big points at 'a' and 'b' should be played  instead.]
;W[cp]L[er]C[If I had been White, I would have played at 'a'.  Now, on your next move, Black gets to live too easily.]
;B[er];W[dq];B[dr];W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[cn]L[jd][fc]C[Again, this much too aggressive for  this stage of the game. Black should play at the big points of 'a' or 'b'.]

;W[gr]C[Now White is showing too much aggressivity.];B[fr];W[hp];B[gp];W
[dk];B[dl];W[ck];B[bm];W[bp];B[bk]C[Good local move.];W[fm]C[Again, too agressive  for this stage of the game.]
;B[gm];W[gl];B[hm];W[fl];B[fn];W[ho];B[ek]L[em]C[This is a good move. Connecting at 'a' would have been to  passive.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[dh];B[jm]C[Good local move. (Although the big points  are still not being played).]
;W[hk];B[jj]C[Chasing Black from a distance,  this is very good.];W[gi]
;B[gj];W[hj];B[fj];W[ii];B[gh];W[em];B[eh];W[hh];B[fi]L[gg]C[Playing at 'a' would have been better.]
;W[hi];B[lr]L[nn]M[pj][qn]C[This move is too aggressive. Playing at 'a' would be  much better. At 'a' the black stone works well with the marked stones to  create territory while at the same time putting pressure on the White group.  This is the essence of a good move at go: making territory while attacking.]
;W[jr];B[hr];W[or];B[pr];W[op];B[pq];W[mr];B[lp];W[lq];B[kq];W[mq];B[kp]
;W[kr];B[oo]L[gg]C[Black should play at 'a' as it continues to put pressure on  the central white group. The move at P5 is not urgent.]
;W[gg];B[fg];W[fh];B[dg]C[This is a goold local move.];W[cg];B[ci]L[df]
C[Even though the  move at C11 is good, I would have played at 'a' to prevent White from playing  there himself.]
;W[df];B[eg];W[ch];B[dj];W[gd];B[fe];W[ge];B[ee];W[de]L[cc]M[gd][ge]
C[White should have played at 'a' instead. At 'a' he  would have been able to maintain a link with the two marked stones and  preseve a good part of the bottom as territory.]
;B[hf]C[I don't understand  this move. White is only going to connect, and this will leave a lone black  stone up against a strong white group.]
;W[gf];B[hg];W[ig];B[if];W[jf];B[jg];W[ie];B[ih];W[he];B[ig];W[kg];B[jh]
;W[ji];B[kh];W[lh];B[ki];W[lf];B[li];W[nc]C[This is a good move by White.]
;B[oc];W[gh];B[ec];W[fc];B[fd];W[dc];B[gc];W[hc];B[fb];W[qf];B[nd];W[mc]
;B[mh];W[rd];B[qc]M[lh][kg]C[Instead  of responding to White's move, Black should have taken the initiative and  capture the marked stone, putting the second marked stone in atari.]
;W[qi]C[White has succeded, with his three stones, in laying waste what should have  been Black territory.]
;B[qj];W[no];B[nn];W[on];B[po];W[mn];B[nm];W[mm];B[mo];W[ko];B[ln];W[lo]
;B[ml];W[lm];B[ll];W[km];B[kl];W[kn];B[hl]L[pi]M[lh]C[This is not an urgent move. A much better move would have been to  play at 'a' and then to capture the marked stone.]
