;W[fo]LB[cn:A][kq:B][hq:C]C[reid:  hmmm, personally, I prefer to play a (c6)
instead of f5.  I feel like I can get a base
easily, and later on, I'll probably get some good aji
around b (l3).  For this reason, I would also prefer
to play black c (h3) instead of j4.  But all this is
probably more stylistic than anything else :-)];B[dn];W[dr]LB[cq:A]C[reid:  I also prefer to leave d2 for later,
since it may become preferable (later) for
white to invade at a (c3) instead.];B[cq];W[kp]C[reid: good! important for w to pincer this stone.]
;B[nc]C[reid: hmm, unusual for b to walk away from the severe
pincer.  but not unplayable, I think.];W[qf]LB[pf:A]C[reid: I like this move for w too.  Getting very
stable here makes it harder for b to make his
moyo into real territory.  White a (q14) in contrast
implies that white wants to have a moyo building.
Which is not necessarily bad, but since white is a
move behind, it's hard to compete head to head.
Again, this is probably more my personal style talking.];B[jd];W[in]LB[fm:A]
[dl:B][jn:C][kq:D][cf:E]C[reid: white j6 feels a bit slow to me.  I don't feel
that white has a guaranteed win if he does succeed in
catching the j4 stone, and there is lots of aji around
for black to exploit, so this capture is not "clean".

I'd probably try something like white a (f7).  If black
responds with b (d8), I'd play c (k6).  The capture is
still not entirely "clean", but if w tries to live with
something like the attachment at d (l3), white's right side
moyo would grow as if by magic :-)

Alternatively, white could try invading at (for example) e (c14).
It's hard to say what might happen after this invasion.  But
since the f5 group isn't really settled yet, it could be very
difficult for w.];B[mp]LB[qn:A]C[reid: black tries to exploit the aji, but I feel
this might be too soon.  the b stone (n4) is pretty
deep in white's sphere of influence.  black could be
satisfied to let this aji simmer for a while longer,
and continue to build his moyo instead.  Or if black
really *must* invade, probably the normal approach
at a (r6) would be less trouble.];W[kq]LB[jo:A][ko:B][lo:C]C[reid:  If I were white, I'd look at the previous
diagram (before this move) and say to myself: "Now
where can I move that will solve my problems while
givving him the most trouble?"  Of course, white
wants to split the black stones, and this move does
that, but it still leaves the problem of black
splitting white with a (k5) (which he does next, of
course :-).

Instead of l3, how about white b (l5) or c (m5)?
These moves still keep the black stones split, but they
also help to patch up the hole at a (k5).];B[jo]C[reid:  I guess this is to be expected :-)]
;W[lo];B[jn];W[iq]LB[il:A]C[reid:  in a large moyo game like this, if
white connects under, he must consider it
a failure.  The proverb says "run before
living" and we can modify it to say "run
before connecting" equally appropriately :-)

Connecting under should be white's last resort.
Instead, I think I'd keep chasing with something
like a (j8).];B[gp]C[reid: ouch!  that hurts white a bit :-)  good move
for black.];W[gq];B[fp];W[ep];B[eo];W[eq];B[hn];W[hp];B[go];W[ho];B[gn]
;W[io];B[im]C[reid:  good move for black!  saving j4 is small,
and only gets black in trouble when white comes
out at j7.  but this way, black gets good thickness
to make his moyo quite grand.  Black is ahead
after this sequence...];W[jp];B[jm];W[pn];B[pj];W[ol];B[ql]LB[nj:A]C[reid:  black is perhaps a bit jealous here?
simply pulling back with a (o10) is simple and
easy for black, and continues to build his moyo
on a grand scale.  Black should remember that
he can still live in white's lower right corner.];W[rn];B[nj];W[ll];B[jj]
LB[lj:A][mk:B][ml:C][kk:D]C[reid: this move (black k10) is asking white
to split off and attack three stones with a (m10).

Perhaps black should simply run at a (m10) himself.
or he could try a feint at b (n9).  If white insists
on holding the territory with c (n8), then black d (l9)
looks ideal.];W[lj]C[reid: natural :-)  if white can destroy black's
moyo while harrassing the o10 stones, he can get
back in the game.];B[qh]LB[of:A]C[reid: Again, I'd prefer to "run before living".
Probing at a (p14) to see how white responds
might be interesting.  But the territory on the
right side is very small compared to black's
center moyo.];W[pb]LB[nf:A][og:B]C[reid: q18 is a fairly "normal" move, but in
this game, white's only chance is going to
be to do something about the black center
moyo.  And q18, while big in and of itself,
will have *no* impact on the future of the game.
I think I'd try a (o14) or b (p13), hoping  to continue attacking the o10 group.]
;B[me]LB[li:A]C[reid: again, this n15 is big, but a bit slow.
The safety of the o10 group is pararmount.
I'd probably play a (m11) to try to connect,
or at least build some thickness.];W[og];B[oh]LB[mh:A][nh:B]C[reid: "run before living" suggests a (n12)
or b (o12) might be better.];W[ng];B[nh];W[lg];B[de]C[reid: hmmm, is the black group alive yet?
doesn't seem to be clearly alive.  If white
has a chance to kill it, then d15 is too slow.];W[le]LB[lh:A][rj:B]C[reid: good! the way to kill the black group is
to get thick here so black can't come through
at a (m12).  Then a placment at b (s10) might
be lethal! (or at least profitable :-)];B[ld];W[ke];B[kd];W[ie]LB[je:A]
[if:B]C[reid:  This looks like an overplay to me.
How would white handle black a (k15)?

Pulling back to b (j14) would be safer.];B[id]C[reid: black is so generous :-)]
;W[he];B[hd];W[dg]LB[ih:A]C[reid: Desperate times call for desperate measures :-)
But if white gets away with this, the game could
swing back to even.

A safer move would be something like a (j12) to help
protect the cuts.];B[fg]C[reid: good!  If black keeps white from connecting,
he should be able to keep the lead.];W[ef];B[fd]LB[ge:A]C[reid: black f16 seems too concerned with just
keeping his territory intact.  White would have
more trouble dealing with black a (g15).  The
black groups can't really get in any trouble,
so black should attack!  Getting small profit
>from attacking (in sente) is *much* better than
trying to take big profits in gote.];W[ff];B[gg]C[reid: this is too easy for white :-)]
;W[ge];B[je];W[jf]C[
 drsl 12k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[kf];W[ig];B[kg]C[reid: severe!  now white's gonna struggle.]
;W[kh]LB[ii:A][ci:B]C[reid:  Ok, this is important:  If you want to
help out the h15 group, you need to play stones
that can *connect* to them.  So something like
a (j11) or b (c11) are what you  need here.
the stones around m13 are *not* as important
as the h15 group (unless you're trying to kill
the p12 group, of course :-) so you can let them
go for now.];B[jg];W[jh];B[if];W[hf]C[reid: ouch!  ko is not very satisfactoy for white.]
;B[hg];W[jf];B[lf];W[ih];B[if];W[fn]LB[eh:A]C[reid: If you have local ko threats, you should use
them first: a (e12) looks good here (instead of f6).];B[jf];W[fm];B[gl]
C[reid: difficult fight for white now...];W[el]LB[fl:A]C[reid: taking a liberty at a (f8) is more usual
in a fight like this.

E8 doesn't really seem to threaten anything,
so black can just reinforce and expect to do well
in the fight to come.];B[fi];W[ej];B[ei];W[gk];B[hj]LB[hm:A][hl:B][fl:C]
C[reid: Woops!  black is just letting white have
a (h7)?  looks like black should play b (h8).
then he can save himself with c (f8), etc if
he needs to.];W[gj];B[hk]LB[hm:A]C[reid: black patches up his problem at a (h7),
putting white on the spot!];W[gi];B[hi];W[hh];B[gh]LB[fk:A][fl:B][hm:C]
[dj:D]C[reid: So now everybody is cut up and the
fight is complicated.  At times like this it's
*vital* to understand the true situation on
the board.  In this case, a bit of study shows
that the critical stones are the three white
stones at g10.  Whatever happens, white must
have those three stones in order to be able
to capture either the center black group or
the f11 group.  And a bit more study shows that
black can make a severe move at a (f9) that threatens
the key stones!  So white *must* prevent black a.

He has two choices: b (f8) threatening c (h7) or d (d10)
threatening to capture the f11 group.  If it were me, I
think I'd play b (f8).];W[jk]C[reid: white doesn't really have time for this :-(]
;B[fk]C[reid: ouch!];W[fj];B[ek];W[dj];B[dk];W[cj];B[ci];W[ck];B[dl];W[dm]
;B[fl];W[cl];B[em];W[cm];B[cg];W[bo]C[reid: if white just lives here, he will
not have enough territory to win.  The
black upper left corner is huge (80 pts).];B[cn]LB[bn:A]C[reid: better to not play this exchange.  The
proverb says: "Don't push into the knight's move".
instead, you should "cut across" it which would be
a (b6) in this shape.  Of course, it doesn't work,
so black should just play elsewehere.];W[bn];B[bj];W[bk]C[
 drsl 12k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[bi]C[
 larryr 12k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[cp];B[ak];W[bm];B[co];W[bp];B[al]
LB[dq:A]C[reid: eh?  why doesn't black connect at a?];W[dq];B[gm];W[do]
;B[en];W[dp]LB[lh:A][mm:B][mh:C]C[reid: This move is completely unnecessary.  It's
just a 1/2 point ko.  Since white has 6 liberties,
the c3 stone cannot possibly cause any trouble.

If we count now, we find that black has 95 to 100 points
(80 in the upper left, 10 in the center, and 5 to 10
on the right).  The white bottom area is about 75 (with luck)
and the upper right is 15.  So white is behind.  Unfortunately,
the white center is very thin: black a (m12) and b (n7) for
example look quite threatening, so white won't be able to press
on the q10 group as hard as he would like to.

It's difficult for white now.  Perhaps his best bet would
be to "hunker down" with c (n12) and try to slug it out
in the endgame - hope for a mistake...];B[mg];W[lh];B[mh]C[reid: black's worries are over, he can coast
>from now on.];W[cd]C[reid: desperation :-)  but not really feasable.
black is too thick.];B[cc];W[dd];B[ed];W[ce];B[df];W[cf];B[ee];W[bc];B[bb]
;W[be];B[ac]LB[bg:A]C[black a (b13) kills white outright.];W[ad];B[bd];W
[nf];B[mf];W[bc];B[ab];W[bg];B[ch];W[af]C[reid: it is more than white deserves to get
a ko out of this :-)];B[bd];W[il];B[hl];W[bc];B[qc];W[bd]LB[ma:A][pq:B]
C[reid: White needs to answer this threat.  Actually
it's not a good threat for black to make since it
helps white to slide in to a (n19).  A better threat
for black would be b (q3) and etc.];B[pc]C[reid: This is a disaster for white.  No hope
after this.

In this game, I think white lost because he didn't
manage to get his stones working together.  Playing go
is like commanding an army.  Individual soldiers (stones)
are nothing.  What's important is when groups of soldiers
work together.  If you strive to coordinate your stones,
making sure that they have some relationship to all your
previous stones, you will find that your army can accomplish
great things, and your games will become more interesting.
You'll also get stronger, of course :-)];W[oc];B[ob];W[od];B[qb];W[qd];B
