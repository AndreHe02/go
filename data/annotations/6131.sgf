C[Hello! My name is Jan and I will try to review your game to the best of my 5-kyu ability. In particular, this means that it's quite possible that I made a mistake somewhere, especially in the more complex variations. Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me either via eMail or on KGS where I go by the name of Pallando.

I will prefix my comments with a "J:".

On a further note, I am thankful that you took the trouble to add thoughts and questions to the game. This helped me a lot to decide what to show and discuss, and I believe you will profit a lot more from this review that way. Therefore, I can only encourage you to continue doing it.

Well then, let's get started!

------

This is a game where I lost in part because of some crude tactical mistakes but where I struggled to find good strategic moves. I failed to find the moves that would have made my position more secure or shapes that are less prone to attack.

I am grateful for any comments general or specific the reviewer might feel are relevant to my style of play or choice of moves. I have commented on my reasoning behind key moves and put a few questions.

Thanks in advance,

J: This is also a new move to me. To my mind, it's rather helping black convert his moyo into territory than doing much else. See further.]

(;B[qf]LB[ph:A][qh:B]TR[qc][rc][qd][rd]C[That must not be the correct way to deal with the attachment. Would A or B be better?

J: I think it is correct to hane as you did, as this prevents White from easily settling himself right in the middle of Black's sphere of influence. See the variation of A for reference.

Black B, inviting a fight, is a possibilty, but there are too many possible continuations to get started on. Here, as Black, I'd prefer to keep things simple - considering the number of stones Black has already invested in the right, he'd better make sure he comes out with something and not gamble it all on a fight where White will be putting much less on the line.

Note that White may well get the chance to retreat into the upper right corner during the fight.]

J: As the proverb says, "play urgent moves before big moves". Here, I feel it is urgent to connect Black's lower stones with a move around A, B or the like, considering White's thickness above.]
;W[po]LB[qm:A][qo:B]C[This is annoying because I am not very thick above.

J: Indeed, this is difficult. I think your answer worked reasonably well this time; maybe I'd have played the pincer at A, which at the same time strenghtens Blacks weak stones. 

I was interested in seeing how the different Josekis worked out, so I'll be giving quite a number of them here. Don't worry about remembering or even understanding them in full detail. They are merely given to show you a few possible outcomes.

(;B[qp];W[qo]LB[qm:A][qn:B]C[White played heavy. Was there some better way for him to make sabaki?

J: White's purpose is to keep black seperate. In that regard, this seems possible. White playes around A or B instead put less pressure on the corner, so Black might ignore and jump to his two stones instead.]

J: Yes - "urgent before big". First of all, I'd still be concerned about White seperating the squared group from the bottom, and second, White is not completely alive yet, so chances are he'll have to answer. See variation.

J: See further.];B[hq]LB[eo:C][fo:A][gq:B]C[Would A or B be better?

J: Yes and no. Black seems ahead on territory; therefore I'd like to play simple and connect the two weak weak stones with H3. Invitiing a fight with A or C is possible, but it's hard to predict. White is behind, so he should be the one to make trouble, not you!

Note that B is a bad move, inviting White to keep black flat with H4 and J4, or, even more, to hane at H3 and threaten the three stones.]

[oj][mk][ok][pk][qk][ml][nl][ol]C[I thought I had the marked stones in a net.

J: This is a critical moment.

From here on, you will be trying hard to capture these stones, thereby weaking your own stones. Therefore, it's important to ponder if these two stones are even worth it.

Their only importance comes from the fact that they are cutting stones. Capturing them thus will strengthen your shape. 

Note, however, that the squared group has ample room to run away and try to connect with the bottom side, so for their sake, capturing them is not important. Indeed, merely threatening to capture them will be your prime way of connecting! Additionally, they are quite sturdy and if things come to the worst, you might win a capturing race with the dead White shape on the right.

The circled group is not in very good shape, but has also plenty of room to run towards the left. For these reasons, I think making a shape move with K10 is best - the bump on the nose tesuji.

Also, though it may seem obvious, please note: If these two black groups live, the game is won. Therefore, making things complicated by worrying about two white stones is not a good idea.]

J: This move creates a lot of cutting points. Black's shape is really bad to begin with, so here, I would probably prefer the sequence Black 1 - White 2 - Black 3 instead, in order not to further weaken Black's shape.

On a sidenote: These white stones aren't all that important. Black is probably trying to hard here.]

[qs][rs][ss]C[My review ends here. Now I want you to do two things: 

Firstly, please think about and try to apply the following thoughts about strength and weakness of groups in your next games. In this game, one major mistake you made was not to think about the strength of your stones. Strength and weakness define whether tenuki is possible, a defending move is needed, or (in particular) whether you can use this group to fight or not.

One example is your C10 move. Although it was certainly a big point, you completely ignored that you had a weak black group on the right side. Even though your opponent let you get away with it in this game, come stronger players you will find your groups getting attacked or even dying. Therefore, just defending may well end up being a bigger move than one that secures 20 points somewhere else. It also adds to your influence in that area, which may well be decisive for future endeavors there. I remember a quote from a book that goes something like this: "If strength is desirable, it may well be worth to spend moves to get it. This realization may change your whole attitude towards the game."

The other example is the L13 group. When you're trying so hard to capture White's L10, you've lost sight of the fact that your shape is just too weak to fight right now. Please take a look at Black's shape after playing J10. I think this image should be enough to visualize this idea. Instead of trying to kill these stones no matter what, it would have been much better to let White wriggle out these few stones and merely give L13 a better shape in the process. If you were worried about P9 group, then simply running away next would have won the game.

Secondly, I recommend spending some time solving go problems to get the hang of techniques such as the belly tesuji that your opponent used against you (White J17, for instance). By improving your tactical skills, I'm sure you will quickly become much stronger. The "Graded Go Problems for Beginners" series by Kano Yoshinori is especially good for this.

Finally, my last comment shall be this: even though this game ended with a difference of roughly 100 points, this has nothing at all to say about your relative strength!

Thanks for your time.
