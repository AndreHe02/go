C[BRG: One area of particular interest to me is the first 20 moves of the game.  I have some difficulty with this in many games and seem to set myself up for a long hard fight later.

io: Hi Brian! My name is Ioana. Currently I play 11kyu and I'm going to review this game for you. Hopefully my advices are helpful to you.]
;B[qd];W[dd]C[io: Are you aware, that with this move you offer the choice of a diagonal fuseki to your opponent? 
There is nothing wrong about that! At least you should know, that you could end up with a diagonal opening, wich (from my limited experiences with this ;) easily makes the game complicated but nonetheless very interesting.
Try it for the fun when you get the opportunity!]
(;B[pq];W[dp];B[pj];W[oc];B[od]C[BRG:  Not what I expected from Black.

io: You probably expected black Q17?! With P16 now Q10 actually becomes a nice extention from the two black stones on line 16.]
;W[nd];B[pc];W[ob]C[BRG:  Maybe P15 would have been better

io: No, P18 is fine.];B[oe];W[jd];B[fc]
(;W[dg];B[ic]SQ[ec][dg]C[BRG:  Perhaps better to attack and defend both at E17?

io: K17 seems to be the right answer to this black move and black would probably play the same if your D13 stone was at E17 instead. To atack F17 I'd have played H17 instead of D13.]
;W[jc];B[id];W[ie];B[he]C[io: This looks like a normal opening so far. As you said you  have problems judging opening moves let me outline some opening rules of thumb:
 a. play in empty corners
 b. enclose or approach "unbalanced" corners (as you did here in move 6. Blacks lower right corner is another "unbalanced" corner, the stone not being played on a symetrical point (4-4, 3-3). P17 though was the right choice for white.)
 c. play on the sides (If you already have an corner enclosure and play an extention now, it works best if the line of extention is perpendicular to your enclosure.)]

(;W[ea]C[io: This move is gote for white. D18 instead is sente and therefore the better play. In this case, here is why you can't kill the black group later.
See the variations for endgame(!) sequences, that develop from a move at E19 or D18.]

(;B[gg];W[ff];B[jb];W[kb];B[ja]C[BRG:  I was thinking too much about killing the Black group and was not paying enough attention to the weak group of my own. Perhaps L19, followed by M17 would have been wise?

io: You don't really have weak groups here. For the L19, M17 combination, see variation.]

(;W[fa];B[ga];W[cb]TR[hb]SQ[kc][je]C[io: Imagine, you needn't play C18 (because you already played D18 in move 32). Then you could now play at H18 and bring this black group to a dead shape.
Actually you would still have those nasty cutting points (see variation at move 37) so black could live, but only if he can read it out properly. (which you should always assume ;o)]
;B[hb];W[if];B[hg];W[ke];B[ig];W[hj]SQ[cm][gq][jq]C[io: This move is too high, that is to close to the center. The big area for both is the lower side.]
;B[ee];W[fg]C[io: As black's H17 group is alive you could think of giving up five stones for a larger move.]
;B[de];W[ce]C[BRG:  Too late for me, my opponent probably could have played C14 here and caused some serious problems for me.

io: See variation for C14.]
(;B[gi];W[dj]C[BRG:  At this point, I was thinking I would have trouble completely killing the group around H13, but it seemed like I could make some good territory by threatening to surround it.

io: You shouldn't only try to completely kill black groups. You often get more profit by letting your opponent live on a small scale while getting either influence or even a nice framework for your own group.
By the way, this move might make territory and keep black out of it, but I don't see it's a threat on the black group.]
;B[gj];W[hk];B[hi];W[qo]SQ[gq][jq]C[BRG:  What do you think of this move?  Was it a bad idea from the start, or did I give up on it?  Ultimately this area was killed by my opponent.

io: Perfect move :)
This was probably the last opportunity for an invasion at this place. The other worthfull area to play in is the lower side.]

(;B[kg]C[BRG:  Looking back, I think I would have been in bad shape if my opponent had played L11 instead of M12, because he would have had a follow up move at K10 that would have brought him into my center territory.  Was I wrong to trade him inside influence for the unsecure territory opportunity in the middle?

io: 1. There shouldn't be such a thing as "center territory" in a go game. Both players would try to grow their stones like tentacles from groups at the sides into the center, so neither one will get territory there. You were lucky here, to make territory in the center.
2. I'm not sure, if you unterstand the concept of  "influence". Usually you make influence, by sealing in your opponents group "inside" your own stones. 
That often happens, if your opponent invades your position early(!) in the game. He gets territory approximately on the third line, you get a solid wall of stones "outside" (on the fourth line) facing an mostly empty board.
In this state of the game (middel or late midgame) nobody gets influence.]

(;W[nn]LB[pg:A][gq:B]C[BRG:  O6 was a wasted move, and a seriously bad time to make one at that.  Perhaps R4 would have given this group a possibility of life in the corner, or C8 would have prevented an invasion, or Q13 could have started an invasion...

io: This white group won't live with R4. You need more imaginative moves for such a feat. Sorry, I don't see a way for your group to live, maybe you need the imagination of a dan-player for this or maybe it just doesn't work at all.

Neither C8 nor Q13 is an invasion, they are both reductions. I like Q13, but if black gets to play at C8 that's big too.
And I wonder what would happen, if black played G3.]
