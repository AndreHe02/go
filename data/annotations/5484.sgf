C[Dear reviewer,
I played white in this game and lost by resigning.
Normally I like to play a patient go with secure groups that give me the opportunity to take initiative. But this game was somehow complex, I had three weak groups and in move 164 I completly missed the overview.
I made some spare remarks introduced by TR.
Please go through the game and give me some hints what I could have done better.
Thanks in advance.

It is a matter of preference though, corner is big to me.];W[qj]

;B[dq];W[dn]TR[cl][fm]C[TR: Until this point I felt satisfied.

When C8 is captured, I think black should be happy for D10 group is alive.

White F7 is a bad move for influence is useless in this position.]

[lb:B]C[TR: Now black has a huge right upper corner and at same time he atack my group k17.
In fact I have three weak groups, black 1 and a half.
What went wrong in this game?
Now the objective was to enclose blacks upper group gaining time to connect the upper white group with the right group.

The problem starts from R5 when you weaken R10 group :)

White A better, with sente at B, you could be easily alive.]

(;W[ie]LB[ic:A]C[Black A better (to prevent white H18).];B[hd]
;W[ff]LB[ib:A][gb:B][hb:C]C[TR: Probably wrong direction an inconsistent with my plan.
Now I prefer h13. Am I right?

Black got sente at A, with B next, it is at least a ko for life...

So the right way to attack is to play at white C.];B[ef];W[eg]

You should reduce the loss by playing white A, if black take 4 white stones at B, at least you get some compensation for white C.]

C[You got lucky here...];B[kf];W[md];B[ld];W[he];B[ge];W[ig]
LB[lh:A]C[TR: horibble move, can I avoid this?

Oh well, the problem is that weak groups are considered NEGATIVE in points...

So good players will try to,
1) make 2 eyes fast
2) connect to some other group
3) simply give it up for good

Follow the guidelines above and one day you will be GOOD :)

Black A more severe...];B[jj];W[lh]LB[gn:A]C[Actually, you need A for connection... 

However, you can't find a chance...];B[go]

You can't let black ponnuki at A.];W[ki];B[mj];W[mi];B[lj]LB[oi:A]
C[White look too thin for a kill now.

White A still important.];W[mg];B[ml]LB[oi:A][lm:B]C[Black got A or B in miai.

I think the game is decided at this point and I shall not comment further.

One major weakness of yours is that you allow opponent to ponnuki too easily.

And you yet to master the technique on handling weak groups...
