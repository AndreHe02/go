RE[W+2.5]

C[My analysis is that I had the win, until I made a mistake in the late endgame which cost me the game.

DRS: Probably.  BTW, I'm not sure I'm qualified to comment on this game.
I'm 3 kyu on IGS and 4 kyu on KGS.  But I've given it a shot, and I'll ask for my review to be reviewed.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[oo];W[ed];B[qo]LB[oq:A][pi:B][qi:C]C[This
1, 3, 5 pattern is one I have been playing a lot lately and have had a
lot of success with.

DRS: I have no experience with this opening, nor have I ever had a lesson about this kind of opening.  However, kombillo (pro game search tool) likes A next for Black, with B being next most common for Black.  White wants C.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[jq];B[cn]LB[dp:B][ed:A][jq:C][lc:E]
[nc:D][nk:A][ok:B]C[DRS: I believe yly (pro 7 dan, good teacher, my former teacher) may advocate a kakari on A instead.  I know he likes kakari on assymetric corners (A) before kakari on symmetric corners (B), though I'm not sure if C and/or D would change this.  Certainly a black move at E is interesting.]
;W[cp];B[dk];W[en];B[fq]C[In retrospect this seem to be a bad move......

DRS: It is kind of deep, yes.];W[eq];B[pj]TR[oo][qo]LB[pf:A]
[pi:C][qi:B]C[DRS: To me, this is inideal with both A and the triangles.  In relation to A, you want B, and in relation to the triangles you want B or C.  I'd play B because it works well with both.]
;W[mq];B[oq]C[I thought this was a weak move by him as he practically invited me to secure the corner, which i did.

DRS: I agree.  W got 8 points if he's lucky, while B probably secured around 14.]
;W[ci];B[cj]LB[bk:B][ci:C][ck:E][dk:D][ed:A]C[DRS: Ouch.  Don't ask W to strengthen here by attaching.  That gives W strength facing A, which may end up being a sizeable territory.  I think it'd be better to play B, or even run out than to attach.  IIn fact, W's C makes D look like it was a bad move.  I'd've played E instead of D.  C is still severe then, but less so.]
;W[di];B[cd]C[I
am interested about how i could have played this better? i seemed to
end up with 3 weak groups after this, and I felt i was a little lucky
they all escaped];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[bb];B[df]LB[ab:A]
[cg:C][df:B]C[DRS: A instead is common, and good.  Then B (closer than usual because of the cramped quarters). Or alternatively, after A then C.  B is better if you plan to run, C is better if you plan to live local and small.

.];W[ac];B[ic];W[kc];B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[ge];B[hd];W[eg];B[bh]
TR[cj][cn][dk]C[DRS: This isn't necessarily a bad move I suppose, but it does more or less ask W to damage the triangled group.]

;W[fe];B[hg]C[Needless to say i was relieved I could connect these groups!

DRS: Sure.  :)];W[bo];B[bn];W[aj];B[bk]LB[bl:A]C[DRS: This is bad shape.  You should at least think about something like A instead before playing this.]
;W[cl];B[fk];W[gk];B[dm];W[fl];B[em];W[fm];B[bl];W[an];B[am]
;W[ao];B[ak]C[This group barely escapes as well!];W[hq];B[me]
;W[ld];B[nj]TR[pd][pf][pj]LB[oj:A][rj:B]C[are
my last two moves good options?  Should i have expanded my moyo
differently?  I also considered a move around the n5, n6 area.  Or
should i have tried reducing his terrority instead of expanding mine?

DRS: I like these moves, but I'd be tempted by a chicken move like A or B.  The triangled stones are all high, so W has a good shot at invading and living.]
;W[qq];B[pr];W[nm];B[om]LB[pm:A]C[is n5, n6 better?

DRS: I like N5.  Or if you want something in the same spirit as your move, A.]
;W[ol];B[on]C[again, is this too passive?

DRS: I don't think it's too bad.  It strengthens the side a little, and helps preserve your prospects of getting into W's moyo.]

;W[oh];B[qh];W[lk];B[jo]LB[lo:A]C[the results seem to suggest this was an overplay?

DRS: Yes, I think it's too deep.  It may be timid, but I like A.]
