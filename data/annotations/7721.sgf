C[Suphyph: This was a game played in person at a Go club. I, Suphyph (Su) played black and recorded the game. It features a couple sharp fights for L&D on the right side and top left, and scrambles for position at the bottom and top. White resigned. I'm submitting this game on behalf of both players, so comments directed toward both will be appreciated.

Tuomas: Hi, I am 4 kyu from Finland. Fierce fighter and intuitive player. Lets see what I can get from this game. I usually avoid making variations, instead I just try describe what kind of plan I would have for situations. For variation, please sit down and try it out - that is the way to learn.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[cf];W[nq];B[qn];W[jp]C[Tuomas: The flow of the game is starting to get shape so lets stop here to think.

First thing to note is that there is uncompleted joseki in upper left corner. This is always a hint that there are big moves in that area. Black now has sente so he can take advantage from the uncompleted joseki.

Second thing to note is that white chose influence based joseki for bottom right, quickly developing his bottom left stone. Next move to develop this influence is obviously pincer against C14.

In the essence, white has now high level initiative because of his tenuki. Black must move to counter white strategy. The price of this is having one stone disadvantage in upper left corner.

Whatever black does now, it will set the flow for rest of the game.]
;B[fp]LB[fp:A][gp:D][fq:B][gq:C]C[Su: This sort of move (or anywhere at B, C, or D) is my habitual response. My thinking is that I don't want my opponent to get a framework along a whole side, but that's probably misguided. It is probably too early for this move besides.

Tuomas: This is a turning point in the game. Black could develop his own hoshi stone in upper right. He could take the sente to punish from earlier white tenuki. Or he could move against the white framework in bottom, like he does here.

Now count the groups. Black has now two potentially weak groups, or lonely stones. That is not a good thing this early in the game. White K4 is a pincer against this stone, already in place. Black F4 means a fight, a fight in here is bound to make black C14 much weaker. Too early for this, in my opinion.

Think that this black stone and all that will follow it, are pack of sheep. White stones around it are pack of sheep dogs. Black will run, and white will control where he goes. This attack gives control of game flow to the defender.

This kind of move shows the basic attitude of black, or order of his priorities. Consider this game as balancing between building your own territory and breaking your opponents. This move indicates that for black the balance is leaning heavily towards breaking side.]
;W[dn];B[iq];W[jq];B[ir];W[jr];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr];B[eo]
;W[fd]LB[ch:A][cj:B]C[Smalltree: I chose the top because it seems more open, more developable. but is this the best resonse to 5 -- or would a pincer at A or loosely at B have been better?

Tuomas: This is good choice from white. Black group in the bottom has huge hole in middle of it, but attacking it directly would be mistake.

Loose pincer would do wonders when combined with the situation in bottom left corner. Pincer is agressive attacking move, and it would be great here because black already has weak group in bottom left. If this black group ends up running then white can build strength to launch serious attack to bottom.

Now black can extend along left side and settle this group. He will also get closer to bottom left group and can support it better.

If we go back and consider the balance between building and breaking, here white is perhaps leaning little too much for the building. He should be breaking black now.]
;B[qg]C[Tuomas: Dangerous tenuki. And now black is becoming overconcentrated on the right side. White should move against the lone black stone on the left.]
;W[nc]C[Smalltree: Even though I fought my way out of it, 22 now seems too close to B's shimari. What would be best way for white to develop the top?

Tuomas: Black is showing strong fighting attitude so white can expect pincer against this. If white doesn't want more trouble he could just take it slower with K17. Black side is still open.

But overall, white should pincer the C14 stone.  White can develop upper side while black tries to settle this stone.]
;B[lc]LB[lc:A][jd:B][dj:C][pj:D]C[Su: Again, with M17, I was thinking I want to get my share of every side, but perhaps B, C, or D would be better?

Tuomas: There is no need to have early presense on each side this early in the game. I must also warn black that right at the moment, on three sides his presense is very weak.

Playing at D would be over concentrated. It doesn't even make that much territory. B would be safer but would not cause as nice fighting as this one. C looks a bit wrong, it is fast influence building move but because black is inside white framework he should be using slow territory building moves intead. Continuing the joseki at upper right by sliding into corner should work.]
;W[ne];B[le];W[pb];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd];W[qc];B[qd];W[md];B[od]
;W[mc];B[me];W[ld];B[nf];W[jd]C[Su: Who won out in this sequence? White, with the cash at the top, or black with the influence along the side?

Tuomas: The black influence is still quite easy to negate. I would call it quite even.]
;B[no];W[pr]C[Smalltree: Was 40 -- going for corner territory -- best, or should white try for access to the center?

Tuomas: This is alright. If white doesn't defend thsi group black can move against it and build center very easily.]
;B[ko];W[pk]C[Smalltree: It seemed necessary to invade B's moyo--reduction from the center seemed to have too little potential to get the game back in balance. But
1. was white actually behind? was the invasion necessary?
and 2. was this the best way to invade?

Tuomas: It is hard to estimate the situation as long as the left side is uncompleted. If white plays the book move reduction at L10 (middle point of black walls) situation becomes quite interesting. If there is any fight on this area, white is quite likely to make strength against left side and bottom left corner. Where are weak black groups waiting. There are large moves left and white has nice territory waiting, so I think white should choose reduction for now.

The previous black move is also dangerous against the bottom group so white should perhaps defend against it. So first M4 or N4 for defense and then L10 for reduction.

This invasion is dangerous and there is no straightforward way to live after black cap at O9. Still I think it is harder for black to kill this group than for white to live with it.]
;B[ql]C[Tuomas: This looks a bit soft. Capping would be declaration of hostilities.]
;W[qk]C[Tuomas: This is greedy from white. Jump up while you have chance and let black crawn on third line if he wants. Huge risk.]
;B[pi];W[nk];B[lq]C[Su: My aim with this was to cut the white groups, but in retrospect it doesn't look possible.

Tuomas: Too straightforward. Black can just play N4 to force white to connect, and then play large scale cap around M9. White is in trouble and has a lot less space to move sideways.]
;W[lr];B[mr];W[mq];B[kr];W[lp];B[ls];W[js];B[or];W[nr];B[oq]
;W[os];B[mp];W[kq];B[lo]C[Su: Failing the cut, I thought I'd aim for influence towards the middle in preparation for attacking the Q9 group.

Tuomas: Good plan.];W[lr];B[jo];W[ip];B[io];W[hq]C[Tuomas: H4 would be better most likely.]
;B[hp];W[hr]C[Smalltree: So I got a small profit -- was it adequate compensation for black's gain in center influence?

Tuomas: Overall this was quite messy sequence. Typical for kyu players and trying to get rid of this kind of situations would be good step towards becoming shodan.]
;B[lk]C[Tuomas: Black has now nice wall to assist in killing. But even if those white stones were dead, white is not out from the game. But white has to stop this moyo from growing now.]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[ri];B[rj];W[qj];B[rk];W[qi];B[ph];W[lj];B[mk]
;W[mj];B[nj];W[oj];B[ni];W[oi];B[nh];W[nl];B[nm]C[Tuomas: This doesn't look good. Perhaps it should be at N7, then black would not have to defend against white P7.]
;W[om];B[mm];W[rg];B[rf];W[qh];B[sg]C[Tuomas: Q13 or R14 for a kill? If white completes the eye on side, black can remove the one from center.]
;W[pg]C[Su: Up until this point I was fairly confident I could have killed the Q9 group. Perhaps black still has a chance, or perhaps the chance passed long ago?]
;B[oh];W[qf];B[re];W[sh]
(;B[sf]LB[pm:A]C[Smalltree: Isn't white's side eye here is already secure? Should black attack the center eye, perhaps at A? If black P-8 then white Q-10; or if black Q-10, then white P-8, white P-9, black P-6 and white's second eye is destroyed? (Variations)

Tuomas: Correct, this black move should go somewhere else. What is the status of black corner if white plays R15?]
;W[pm]C[Smalltree: I think this is the move that saved my invading group.

Tuomas: White lives and has essentially won the game. White has good lead on secure territory and he just needs to kill the game - remove big moves and take it safe.]
(;B[pf]C[Tuomas: Is it really nesessary to defend in here?]
;W[of]C[Tuomas: White pincer against C14 stone and the game is over. White doesn't need to take chances so wide pincer at C10 is enough. Just so that black can't make territory anymore in there.]
;B[pe];W[og];B[ng]
(;W[oe]C[Su: SmallTree acknowledged this blunder.
Smalltree: Yes, talk about falling asleep!  More important, I now think that I should have been developing the left side or reinforcing my top position rather than chasing the fantasy of killing black's upper right group.

Tuomas: White is showing good sportmanship to keep black in the game :D.]
;B[qg];W[pg]C[Smalltree: So my group lived, but was it worth it? B's center influence and strength in the lower left both turned out to be costly. How could white have gained better results from the invasion?

Tuomas: White invasion was able to live inside the black framework. Is there any way it can get better than that?

Now white has given the sente away and donated almost 10 points for black.]
;B[cj]C[Tuomas: Here black makes the move and now he can try to build terrotory here to catch up white. The value of this stone is hard to measure. If we use the Cgoban score estimation tool, which generally sucks, it says here that game is even with white leading by 0.5 points. If this stone was white then the score would be 28 for white.

How can it be that big differense? Well if white makes 10 points in here, or if black makes 10 points in here we already get 20 point difference.

In practise it is way bigger than this, because if white plays here he can control the game and keep the black center under control.

Also when you look at the board now, you see the reason why reduction is usually so much better choise than invasion. Now the white invasion stones are all useless for the rest of the game. They are there and live, but they don't contribute anymore. We enter the end game, and black has good position to play agressivelly - just when and where the game is really decided.

Compare this to situation where black has big territory on the right but white has strong wall containing it. And with reduction white can expect to get sente.]
;W[cl]C[Tuomas: Painfully slow move for white but he needs to do this to keep his corner safe. It also activates an attack against black group at C12.]
;B[hd]
(;W[hc]C[Smalltree: Is this best way to respond to black 111?

Tuomas: The common sequence is that white plays first H15 on top of this stone, and then after hane connects underneath using H16. It is a bit nasty in here because it gives black nice strength against center but white can still afford it. See some simple variations for this move.]
;B[ic];W[id];B[jc];W[kc];B[gc];W[hb];B[gd];W[fc];B[gb]C[Su: How does the game look overall at this point?

Tuomas: White is taking heavy damage now after that side invasion. Black as now firm control of the flow of the game. On boxing terms, white is leaning on the ropes and black is attacking all out, looking for knockout.

White really needs to get the flow back, he could be doing this heavy attacking just as well as black. The black group in upper right corner only has one eye at P15. White could cut from H5, push from N8, cut from P4 and P5. He could try to pull out the M10 group. He could cut from C12, or F14. He just needs to get the flow back!]
;W[jb];B[ff];W[ce]C[Tuomas: This move is weak in here because blac has such nice move at C17 after this. White has terrible shape in his corner but perhaps by plyaing at E14 or something like that. It aint over yet!

White plan has to get out through these stones and then attack in large scale.]
;B[fe];W[ee];B[ef];W[df]C[Tuomas: This is bad plan. Black shape is already too strong. White should just play B14 and then settle this corner. White only loses a liberty by playing here, and makes his shape horrible.]
;B[dg];W[de];B[cg]C[Tuomas: White shape is terrible, this corner deserves to die.]
;W[he];B[ge];W[hf];B[jf];W[if];B[eb]LB[db:B][fb:A]C[Su: Perhaps white could have lived with D18?

Most likely yes, although fully reading it is really tough. The real point is that this shape is bad and there are lot of potential tesuji for black.]
(;W[fb];B[fa];W[dc];B[cb];W[db];B[da];W[ec];B[ea];W[cc];B[bb]
(;W[bc]LB[bd:A]C[Smalltree: Would A live? (Variations)

Tuomas: Yes it would, B 17 and B15 would be miai for second eye. I am sorry to say this, but that is 30 kyu question :). No variations needed, just connect from B17 or B15.]
;B[bd];W[ac]C[Tuomas: How about A18 here for white? What happens?]
;B[be];W[ab];B[ga]C[Tuomas: Game over. Black has decisive lead and white can't make enough territory to catch up. Even if white had been able to live he would have needed to play very good end game to win. But it would have been worth a shot and the game would have been worth playing to end.

Rest of the moves don't make any differense in this game.];W[hh]
;B[jj];W[jh];B[kh];W[kg];B[jg];W[ig];B[ji];W[ih];B[kf];W[hj]
;B[fh];W[gi];B[cm]C[Tuomas: Lessons from this game.

I must commend black for his fighting spirit and skills. After depressive result from right side, Black took the flow of the game on the crusial moment and took decisive victory in the end.

The weakness for black was to leave some weak groups and dangerous openings. Those openings didn't play a role in this game, but against more agressive player black groups could be quite vulnerable.

White on the other hand had the sad role of being the object of black fighting spirit and skills. White lost pretty much every melee fights, with the living group on the right side as only exception. White should focus more on dual purpose moves, making territory while attacking. Or attacking while making territory.

However white generally had better sense of direction. In early game he had clear advantage, even to point where I was about to declare that the game is over.

For both I would already recommend studying professional games. Focus on shapes, flow of the game and balance between offence and defense. Play it on board so you see and learn the feeling and look of situations. I would recommend Cho Chikun who is territorial player who loves having to solve life and death problems.]
