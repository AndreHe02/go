C[I have added several variations in addition to my comments.  Be sure to go through all of the variations.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[hc]
(;B[cc]SQ[hc]C[Is the 3-3 invasion here thinking too small? I don't get pincered too often and wasn't sure what I wanted to do.

Black has 4 basic options here:

Dive into the corner.  Black can live but white gets a strong wall facing down one side.

Run into the center.  White can strengthen his position while chasing black.

Attack white's stone at H17.  Black should not expect to kill white, just build a stronger position while attacking.

Ignore white's threat and play elswhere.  White needs to play 2 more stones to completely kill black.  One around D17 and another around F15.  Black could wait until white plays one of these moves and then black would play the other.  So, if white blocks the corner, black runs out into the center.  If white caps black then black dives into the corner.

I think that attacking white is best.  White gains a lot with the first 2 options.  The 4th option allows white to decide what black with do with this stone.

See Variation for one attack option.];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb]C[Black is alive in the corner and white has a wall facing the upper side]
;W[fb]SQ[fc]C[This black stone has no base and is next to a large white wall. Write it off as dead and play else where.

You could use it later for a series of ko threats if needed. This means that, after you take the ko, your next move is by this stone and threatens to run this stone out into the center. White will probably respond and then you can re-take the ko. You could play a several moves that threaten to save this stone, which gives you several ko threats.]
;B[fe]SQ[pj][qj][gq][cn]C[I wasn't sure if I should send in reinforcements for F17 or if I should play elsewhere.

Elsewhere.  The squares are all good opening moves];W[he];B[jd]
SQ[hc][he]C[This doesn't threaten white's marked stones since they can connect to the white wall.  It is too high and too close to the wall to secure the upper side.  So, this move doesn't accomplish much.]
;W[gc]SQ[gg]C[White should play the square to kill. This moves drives black into white's wall.

This is how you use a wall.  You don't attack from the wall. You attack on the other side of a weak group and drive it into the wall.]
;B[fd]SQ[gg]C[This is a heavy move.  Black needs to be running away.  Be ready to sacrifice a few stones if it saves the rest.

The square is also a good move for black since it leans away from the white wall.

A good rule of thumb is to play on the spot your opponent would like to play next.]
;W[gg]TR[eg]SQ[fc][fd][fe]C[These stones are probably doomed.  The only opening left to run through is around E13.  It is small and takes them towards the white stone in the lower left corner.

Play elsewhere];B[gf];W[hg]TR[fc][fd][fe][gf]SQ[hf]C[White should have played on the square to contain black.  Black could cut, but that would not save the marked stones]
;B[hf]C[Black takes advantage of white's error.];W[if];B[ie]
;W[id];B[je];W[jc];B[ge]TR[hf][gf]SQ[fe][fd][fc]C[The two marked strings of stones can't be cut so you don't need to connect them.

This also puts white in Atari, but white could just connect and be safe so nothing would be accomplished.]
;W[jf]TR[hd]SQ[hg]MA[ig]C[White should connect at the triangle.  The marked stone prevents a ladder if black cuts at J13, so black's cut wouldn't work.]
;B[hd]C[Black takes advantage of white's error.

Black has connected all of the upper side stones and has an opening facing the black stone in the upper right corner.  This is very good.]
;W[ic];B[ld]C[Good extension.  Black has saved his stones.  In exchange, white has some territory on the upper side and a wall facing the center.]
;W[jp];B[qj]C[This is a good opening game move.

A good rule of thumb in the opening is to look for the largest gap between stones and play in it.  You don't have to play in the center of the largest gap, just somewhere in it.]
;W[cm];B[nq]C[This is the end of the opening game and the start of the mid-game.]
;W[jj]SQ[ai][jm][eg]C[White threatens to take a huge area of left lower corner and center territory.  An invasion would be dangerous so black should try to reduce this area.  There are still large gaps in white's moyo so black should be able to reduce it a lot.

The position of white's stones makes row K the boundry of white's potential territory.  Playing to the left of row K is an invasion and is dangerous.  Playing on or to the right of K is a reducing move and much less dangerous.

The squares are all good places to start reducing white.  Black should try to play all of them eventually.

I would start with K7 since that is the largest gap and black has strong stones on the right side and right lower corner.  After I finished reducing white as much as possible from this point, I would play E13.  This is very close to both of white's walls so white will be able to block black more effectively.

I would play A11 third because it won't reduce white by much. Black will probably end up crawling along the left side.]
;B[fg];W[fh];B[eg];W[eh];B[dg];W[dh]C[White blocks black's reduction without losing much potential territory.]
;B[ch]C[This is a dangerous cut.  It creates a new, very weak black group. This stone is too far from the upper left corner stones to connect easily and there isn't much room to make eyes on the left side.]
;W[bh];B[ci];W[gd]SQ[jm]C[White forces black to connect.  This is an end game move worth 1 point.  There are still a lot of more valuable places to play.

K 7 is a key point for both black and white.];B[he];W[kd];B[ke]
;W[ec]TR[ch][ci]SQ[dc][dd][ce][cf][cg]MA[cm]C[White doesn't need to connect here.  Black could play here and cut off the marked white stones.  However, killing the marked black stones would save white's stones and I don't think black has enough space to make 2 eyes because of the white stone at C7.

We are at move 56 and the entire lower half of the board has only 7 stones.  This is very unbalanced.  Try to spread your stones around better.  You don't always have to play within 2 inches of your opponent's last stone.]
;B[kc]C[I considered D15 here also, thinking I might get to kill some white's corner groups.

See my comment for move 59.];W[jb]
(;B[bg]TR[ce][cf][cg][bh]SQ[de]MA[ch][ci]C[D15 is better because it cuts off the marked white stones.  This results in a capture race between the marked white stones and the marked black stones.

See Variation];W[de];B[bi]SQ[ch][ci]C[Black connects to the upper left corner stones.  Now that the marked stones are safe, black can focus on reducing white rather than making eyes.]
;W[dj];B[di];W[ei];B[bk];W[kb];B[lb];W[ka]
(;B[la]C[White's last 2 moves were small endgame moves.  Black could ignore this move and sacrifice a few points on the upper side in exchange for reducing white more.

See variation.];W[ia]C[White doesn't need to play here.  These stones are alive.]
;B[kf]SQ[jm][dl][jq]C[This helps secure black's upper right territory but doesn't reduce white's larger area.  K7 is still the best reducing move.  K3 and D8 are also good.

If white secures the huge center area, then black loses.  Black should focus on reducing white's center.]
;W[ih];B[kh];W[nm]SQ[kh][nq]C[White invades.

Imagine a line from the black stone at L12 to the black stone at O3.  A white play inside (to the right of) this line is an invasion.  Anything on or outside (to the left of) this line is a reducing move.]
;B[pm]SQ[lm]C[Black could surround white by playing at M7.  Then white has to make 2 eyes inside black's area.  If black is at least fairly confident of killing white then M7 is a good idea.  Otherwise Q7 or O10 are good blocking moves.]
;W[nj];B[pg]C[I was worried that the 3-3 invasion was about to happen, but thought this would be worth more than defending the 3-3.]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[Good, drive white towards your wall on the top.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]
(;B[mc]C[Not sure why I jumped ahead of the joseki here. I figured I had a chance to kill his invasion using my strength on the top, but didn't know how to do it.

Black's wall along row M makes it harder for white to extend along the top side far enough enough to live.  Black should try to kill white by attacking in the corner.

See variation];W[nc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[sd]
(;B[qf]C[Attack inside white's group.  Don't assume that white can automatically live and just try to block white's expansion.

Remember that you use a wall by attacking the other side of a weak group and driving it into the wall.

See variation];W[mh];B[nb];W[oa];B[na];W[qa]C[White doesn't make a solid connection.]
(;B[mf]TR[rc]SQ[pb]C[Black can take advantage of white's cutting point at Q18.  I don't think that black can kill white but black can reduce white.

See Variation];W[lg];B[kg]SQ[ih][jj]C[This is a good way to reduce white, but the marked stones will limit how much black can reduce white.]
;W[li]
(;B[cp]TR[bk]SQ[cm]C[I was feeling pretty desparate at this point and figured I needed to attack somewhere. The corner seemed the most vulnerable.

The marked white stone will make living in the corner more difficult. The marked black stone might help black a little.

The 3x3 point is usually the best place to invade a corner.

See variation]
(;W[dp]C[White should play on C3 and block the corner.  Then black would have to live on the left lower side.

See Variation];B[cq];W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[do]SQ[lo]C[I know the corner itself isn't worth enough and that I need to wriggle out to get some of the center somehow. I have no idea how though.

Live first, then wriggle out.  Wriggling out is pointless if your stones are dead.

You can still reduce white around M5 once your corner stones are alive.]
;W[cn];B[eo];W[fp]
(;B[fo]C[It seems like I needed to do something bigger or more creative here.

Go back to the corner and make those stones live.

See variation];W[go];B[gp];W[ep];B[gn];W[ho]
(;B[gq]TR[dq][dp][ep][fp]SQ[cp][cq]C[This move and the next move (H6) seemed again like chances to make the attack work, but lacked vision.

This is another capture race.  Both groups have 3 liberties but it is white's turn.  White will win.

Black should focus on making at least some of his stones live.

See Variation];W[cr]C[White takes on of black's liberties and wins the capture race.]

;B[ck]SQ[do][eo][fo][hn][gn][fl]C[Currently, white is leading.  If black can make the marked stones live, then the game is close.]
;W[qq]SQ[nq]C[With the marked stone present, black should be able to kill this invasion.]
;B[qp]C[Good];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq]
(;B[gh]C[This is good for a ko threat.  Otherwise it just makes white connect.

I don't think that white's lower right corner stones are dead yet.

[dl][el]SQ[do][eo][fo][hn][gn][fm][fl]C[This error drove me over the edge and I resigned. He was shocked and said the thought I was winning most of the game, which was funny since I was sure I was behind the whole time. I guess it may have been a little too early to give up on getting something ou of the lower left or center from him.

The marked stones are still in doubt.  Whoever kills in this area wins.  White has a stronger position and will probably kill black, however.]

;W[lq]C[White captures];B[mp];W[mn];B[mo];W[mq]C[Black loses about 5 points around L3.

Killing white in the lower right corner is worth around 25 points.

I calculated the 25 points this way:
Not killing the 7 white stones in the corner means black doesn't get them at the end of the game as points.  This reduces black's score by 7.
A live white group would reduce black's territory in the corner by around 15 points.
This live white group would have at least 2 points of territory in its eyes.

So, black's score goes down by around 15+7=22 points and white's score goes up by at least 2 points.  I rounded off to 25.]
