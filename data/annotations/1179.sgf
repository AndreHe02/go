C[Otakung:I'm 8k* (black) and my opponent is 7k* , I win by white resign but I seem I have many mistakes in the opening and middle game .  :)]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qn];W[np];B[pj];W[qg];B[nd]C[O16 doesn't seem to put enough pressure on R13.  Seems that R15 would be a  better move because it takes out W's S16/R17 option.  Say, B R15 P13 O16 is  a better sequence for B.  If B worry about the invasion point at R8, there's  little catch which will be explained later.]
;W[og];B[ld]C[Similar problem as O16.  However, because O16-Q16 is OK now, B should  play at R11 to prevent R8 or play at R15, which takes out W's eye-
making option (S16) AND secure the corner for 15~20 pts.];W[ql]
;B[pl]C[The play here is S10.  No need to worry about R6 because B has R3 to live
the corner.  With the wall (M16-O16-Q16) that B had, no reason not to use
it.  When B S10; if W P8, B O10 to attack P13-R13 group first.  Later, to
save R6, B could choose R3 or S8 depending on the surrounding sitution.
The little catch here is the R3 - because B has R3, R6 is disposable; thus,
B can take the attacking position first and not to worry about R6 so much.]
;W[qk];B[pk]C[Still, B should S10 here.  The reason is the same: Taking attacking position
and use R3 as safety measure.];W[qj];B[pm];W[qp]C[Up to this point, W leads.  Q10 group is a wall without territory - with no  group to attick, it's kind useless.  Also, M16-O16 are not fully utilized  either.  Allowing W settle R13 group AND R4 to secure corner, B's checkbook  is not balanced.]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[pg];W[pf];B[qi];W[ri];B[pi];W[qf];B[of]C[What does this cut do for B?  If W played at P14, would it threat any of B's  group?  If the answer is 'NO', P14 is not urge as R16.  After giving up the  righte side and R4, B needs some territory to counter-balance W's lead.]
;W[oe];B[nf];W[od];B[oc];W[ne];B[md];W[pe];B[mf];W[qd]C[Why not Q17?]
;B[pc];W[qc]C[Too small...  W should D10 or D14.  R13 group is live and well, R17 is just
a yose move - it's not the time.];B[cn]C[D6.  This game develops into that W-territory and B-poteitial kind of game.
Thus, pull up the position, go for the moyo in the center.]
;W[cl];B[fq]C[???  What does B want to accomplish using F3?  B has less stones over here; so  it'd be a better idea to keep them together than spread them apart.  W has a  stornger position here; so B should E6 head to B's strong point - the wall at  the right side.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[kq];W[dn]C[C6 is wasted...  There's no visible connection between F3 group and the wall  over the right - over the right, it'sB has potential; down here, B go for  territory - it's an inconsistency in B's play (strategy).]
;B[di]C[This is a good one.];W[cf];B[ce];W[df];B[fd];W[ic]C[It's an overplay of W.  What W ought to do is to live D14 group first - or not
to D14 but went for J17 directly.  Now B has the chance to double-play W's J17  and D14 group...]
;B[ie]C[This is another good move.  From here on, B play some very good move and turn
the table around.  This move surely punish J17's mistake.];W[kb]
;B[gb];W[mb];B[nb];W[mc];B[nc];W[hb];B[gc];W[jd];B[je];W[kd]
;B[ke];W[lc];B[ci]C[Yet, another good move from B.  From here on, B use its potential on the right  very well and W jsut keep on stuggling to find a way out.  Not only B save C6  but also kill W's lower-right corner at the end...  Everything starts here ^^
There are some tatical mistakes afterwards, but it's not the intention of this  review to point them out.]

E8 then D8 - W is not alive very well yet.  If B N8, W E8, B could still have  P3.]
;W[mm];B[mk];W[oi];B[oh];W[nk]C[It looks like W gets a second chance...]
;B[el];W[ek];B[kj];W[nl];B[ji];W[dl];B[li];W[lh];B[lj]C[Use N12 then M13 - live for sure (after W N15, R18 and O13 are equivlent), and  sente.  The reason is it doesn't seem like B could get the center back after  W O8, so B shouldn't add more points for W.]

game.  Instead of holding its lead, W made overplays, and therefor gave B the
chance of coming back.  B had done a good job at the upper side, left side,  and finally the low-right corner.  These are B's winning factors and J17 is  the losing move for W.]
