C[Hi

I am 12 kyu player on littlegolem, a turn based site (I am not a fan of on line games), so perhaps some of my notes will be a little more complicated as number of alternatives.
Also, the power play difference is not so high, so please consider my comments as simply thoughts and alternatives for play. Maybe best I can do is to propose some questions.
My comments wil be prefixed by R initial. Enjoy.

Hikertrash [18k\]: Hi ... have fun

Hi, this is a recent game of mine. Although I won, I feel I got away with some bad play at points throughout the game. Sometimes, I felt like I was playing aimlessly, unsure what to do next. I'll point out these moments.

I would love some strategic direction as well as any tactical advice you might be able to spot.

Thank for for your time!];B[pd]C[Jarek [18k\]: hi];W[qp]
(;B[dc]C[R: When diagonal corner is available, some preffer to take it right away (se variations). But is nothing wrong with this play.]
;W[dq];B[ce]C[R: This is an invitation for W to invade in upper side. B should concentrate in the left - right sides.]
;W[cn]C[R: W's intentions are unclear. The move is far from the corner, an invasion is anytime possible. A stone is imeediately required arround there, that means 2 moves.]

(;B[jc]C[R: important point, but the B power is not distributed.]
;W[jp];B[cj]C[Is the double wing best formed by extensions on the 3rd line? I'm always tempted to play on the side star-points.
R: I think it's a matter of taste and intentions. On fourth line you are exposed to bellow attacks, but also you place more influence on the center (the real intention, right?). Also, looking at the formation on fileds, a D10 (or even D11) would look more balanced. Because there are no stones on right, I would say there is required to play.]
;W[pf]
(;B[oe]C[Does P15 work well with K17? Or would it be bettwe with K16?
R: I don't feel P15 quite well.];W[of]
(;B[qf]C[I know that this move is potentially bad. My opponent seemingly let me go.
R: I don't think the stone there is dead, see variation. But its popose is not quite well according to the B intentions. I would make a hane to the centre, is to good to loose it.]

(;W[qg];B[rf];W[rg];B[op]C[R: B should still protect his 2 stones. That's another aspect of R14: loosing the initiative for the center. On the other hand, the wall of W is well placed for making teritory on right, I would preffer the kakari from right (R7 or Q6)]

(;W[oq]C[R: W is so wrong! Either pincer N3 or Q6 would look better.]
;B[nq]C[R: good.];W[pq]
(;B[pp]C[R: The particular move in contact with opponent stones is not recommended. The stone P4 had 3 liberties. The new group has... 3 liberties.
Also, think on your goal at the start of invasion: to establis a base on the bottom side and to reduce center moyo.]
;W[np];B[no];W[mp];B[pn]C[R: look the result... B has a group in the center without many alternatives, without base and looking at the W wall.]
;W[po];B[oo];W[qo];B[qn]
(;W[rn]C[R: wrong move. W groups are cut, first should make live before attacking.]
;B[qq]C[This invasion seemed risky. But I was feeling brazen. I was surprised I pulled it off. I figured this move was better than shoring up my weak spot at P6. Comments?
R: it turned out oki, and I think that W had little of chances. Anyway, the situation is looking strange because of miss placed S6.]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[or];W[rm];B[ql];W[rl];B[mq];W[lp];B[pg]
C[R: it seems risky. See previous variation];W[ph];B[og];W[ng]
;B[km]C[R: because the starting ladder is loosing, using it as aji is a very good choice. The drawback is that W is gaining power against the right corner group.]
;W[kk]C[R: too close!];B[ko];W[kp];B[lk];W[oh];B[kj]C[R: good point.]
;W[jk];B[qk]C[R: the B groups are not connected. W could turn arround.]

(;W[qj];B[rk]C[R: not needed. B is suffering in center.];W[rj]
;B[en]C[R: aggresive move. Let's see.];W[qm];B[pm];W[pl]C[R: W is turnning arround...]
;B[pk];W[ol];B[ok];W[on];B[nn];W[om];B[ml]C[R: W goes for little winnings, instead getting a strong situation. B just let W to get some stones and now the B position is looking better. Perhaps a connection (O9) would be better.]
;W[nk]C[R: W doesn't miss it.];B[nj];W[nl];B[oi];W[pj];B[oj]
;W[mj];B[mi];W[mk];B[lj];W[nh];B[ni];W[fc]C[R: after this long sequence, W pressed B in over crowded groups, but the main goal, making a wall along M line, cutting the base and the center oriented stones, was missed.]
;B[mh];W[mg];B[kh];W[lg];B[kg];W[ll]
(;B[lm];W[mm];B[mn];W[kl]C[R: look at the variation. W is cut! W has to run for life in center, and B can even capture.]
;B[gq]C[R: good point, but could be delayed a little.];W[jm]
;B[jo];W[io];B[hp];W[kn];B[ln];W[jn];B[ip];W[lo];B[kr];W[jq]
;B[jr];W[iq];B[hr]C[R: good link. Be preapred to let the 2 stones at H4 go away]
;W[ir];B[is]
(;W[lr];B[lq];W[do];B[md]C[R: why you leave the battle field? E6 is weak.]
;W[fe];B[dm]C[R: right :)];W[cm];B[cl];W[bl];B[bk]C[R: I don't like it. C9 looks stronger.]

(;W[bm];B[dk]C[R: right! W let you take this important point, only for 2-3 points. Good deal!]
;W[eo];B[hn];W[ho];B[go]C[R: It seems again that W preffer to make small moves which brings points, but not position.]
;W[hq]
(;B[gp]C[R: remember the W threat? Let that 2 stones go away!]
;W[gr];B[mr];W[hs];B[js]C[R: small. Block the W in center and attack the 2 stones in left up (H10 for instance)]
;W[fq];B[fn];W[fo];B[il]C[R: is not a sente!];W[jl]C[W; could ignore!]
;B[hj]C[R: good point!];W[ij];B[ik]C[R: hmmmmm... instead of clarifying, the things get complicated. Why to go so sticky with the opponent? H11 would strength the center position.]
;W[jj];B[ih];W[jh];B[jg];W[ji];B[lh]C[R: yup, good seeing!]
;W[ig];B[hh];W[hg];B[je];W[jf];B[kf];W[if];B[le]C[R: I don't think is required... But, of course, better to be safe.]
;W[gg];B[gh];W[fh]C[R: You played close to the opponent, now you are paying.]
;B[fg]
(;W[ff]C[R: oh, NO!];B[eg]
(;W[eh]C[R: too late to repair.];B[cg];W[gi];B[hi];W[gj]C[R: and now the lat chance of capturing the 2 stones is lost. B is happy, and the game is won. B has 36 points in right up corner, 10 points down, 30 points in center left, 24 points on left up corner: 100. W has 24 points in left down corner, 16 points on right side and 10 prisoners: 50 points. And the W's position on up side is crying for help!]
;B[hk];W[gk]C[R: W insists! Should be crashed.];B[gl];W[gm]
;B[fm];W[fl];B[hm];W[hl];B[im];W[fp];B[gn];W[gl];B[el]C[R: not even needed, W is dead.]
;W[ek];B[ej];W[fj];B[dn]C[R: again, not needed, but having 50 points ahead is not harming.]
;W[ei];B[dj];W[dh]
(;B[ch]C[R: better connect!];W[dg];B[ef];W[df];B[ee];W[de];B[ed]
;W[dd];B[ec];W[fd];B[he];W[gf];B[hc]C[R: You see, W tried to live desperately in center. Playing arround, the strength of B grew over whelming, so no W is loosing the group adiacent.]
;W[cc]
(;B[cb]C[R: oh, NO! Remember why W lost right down corner?]

(;W[cf]C[R: well, second chance for B.]
(;B[cd];W[bc]C[R: well, now W should survive on the side... B still winning!]
;B[fk]C[R: or maybe B loose the game.]
(;W[fi]C[R: oh, I see. Yes, this was a mistake.];B[bf]
(;W[be];B[di]C[Jarek [18k\]: thx
Hikertrash [18k\]: THanks for the game


Well, that's it ... it was close capturing race. I felt like I was always one step ahead ... but part of me thinks that was just luck.

Thanks for your comments!

R: well, this was a fighting game, a very good game. Almost all my intention pretty soon were spotted, so basically not very much to say. In the end, maybe due to time pressure, both players made alternatively some mistakes.
I think the strategic principles (with minor correction) are well formed. If you'll observe closer the intention of the opponent and where are your weak points, without trying to close attack anytime, probably in short time you power play will gain a lot!
Hope my comments helped. If you see mistakes in my variants or you are requiring more about some points, please contact me.
Have a nice day, Radu])
