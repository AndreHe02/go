C[Hello dear Reviewer, my nickname on KGS and Kaya is "Oceandrop" I played Black in this game and am 9k on Kaya and 7k on KGS.

Already the opening was unusual for me, a cross fuseki or however it is called, if you have any thoughts on it I would be glad to hear them. I added comments that I hope will help you to review this game and give insight into my thoughts while playing.

Already some complications arrived early in the game, also I have often a hard time to know which points are big or/and urgent, so I felt that I was already in early middle game quite behind.

I marked my comments with "Oc:"



Hi. my name is Kheng Hun, 2k kgs and 2 dan in singapore. I will mark my comments with kh:]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[cp];W[pq]C[Oc:

Think it is normal to play 3-4 in cross fuseki because it is more territorial?

kh: I think its fine though i rarely play this];B[oc]C[Oc:

I thought about playing R10 or E4, I played E4, black approached my corner at Q5 not answering my approach, I felt this was better direction for black than for me, because it was his primary direction, so I maybe did something wrong already.

 Therefore maybe R10 would have been better than E4?];W[ep]
;B[po]C[kh: ok this is good aggressive move for black but still playable as white.]
;W[qm];B[qq];W[qp];B[pp];W[qo];B[qn];W[pn];B[rn];W[rq];B[qr]
;W[ro]
(;B[on]C[kh: here black makes a mistake, giving white sente which makes this rather good for you so far.]
;W[pm];B[oq]
(;W[jp]C[Oc: I thought also about R11 or P5, but I played K4 to strengthen E4 and negate some of the Q4 influence, but maybe P5 better or more active?

kh: this moves seems a little empty, not achieving much];B[lq]
(;W[cq]C[Oc:

Was this wrong? It felt wrong after I played it, maybe play D5 or D6 because I already have two high stones?]
;B[dq];W[dp];B[eq];W[co];B[bp]C[kh: mistake in move order here.]
(;W[bo];B[bq];W[cr]C[Oc:

I thought black would play B2, than white F3, black D2, white E2, black captures and white F4]
;B[fq]C[kh: mistake];W[br]C[Oc: Maybe better Extending at F4?

kh: this is fine, securing your stones.];B[iq]
(;W[qi]C[Oc:

I also thought about D9 or D10, maybe better? I thought it would not matter much because of my D4 group is already safe and my R5 group too, but R11 would be not just like D9 or D10 for making territory but also for preventing black getting a good extension. But in Retroperspective maybe D10 better, because if than black takes R11, I can just ignore it and take another big point?

kh: R11 is a big move but not urgent move. your group is already quite nicely alive. I listed some possible alternatives.]
;B[dj]C[Oc:

now I felt I have to strenghten my D16 stone, so I played C12]
;W[ch]C[kh: this looks good, right direction.];B[fp]C[kh: slow move.]
(;W[qf]C[kh: now this is quite small when top is open, there is D10 stone to attack and P5 cut.]
;B[om];W[ol];B[nl];W[ok];B[nk];W[oj]C[kh: now blacks moyo looks more scary.]
(;B[do];W[eo];B[dn];W[fo];B[cn]
(;W[ap];B[fm];W[go];B[hm];W[io]C[Oc: I was happy after this, he let me into his moyo that he was building with the P7 sequence, but maybe not that good as I thought because my stones made nothing else than destroying potential territory from my oponnent?]
;B[jq];W[gp];B[gq]C[kh: here the game is still quite even. top looks big now. reinforcing C12 is also important]
(;W[mi]C[Oc: Maybe better at K16? I felt behind in Territory and was afraid that he could get even more in the center, so I played N11 with these thoughts in mind + I thought I later could maybe followup this move with P15 and make a little framework.

kh: even with p15 you will not make a lot of territory.];B[cf]
;W[df];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[de];B[bf]C[kh: good play by black, seizing the oppportunity to break into whites corner. now SE claims black is ahead. I agree.]
;W[id];B[kc]
(;W[oe]C[kh: this move is not too big now.];B[nd];W[ne];B[me]
;W[od];B[nc];W[jm]C[Oc:

Should have played this move earlier? It looks good, preventing H7 group to connect to his other group.

Or maybe a move like J14 better? I felt behind in territory, but I thought when I play J14 black can still slide under my stones at the top so it would be of no big use and I hoped I could maybe later use K7 to attack blacks weak shape to the right.

kh: This move does not do too much really, consider the other large moves like K17]
;B[hj];W[oo];B[op];W[no];B[mm];W[lo];B[rm];W[rl];B[ql];W[pl]
;B[sl];W[rk];B[so];W[rp];B[rr];W[sn];B[sm];W[sk];B[kj]C[Oc:

I was quite lost here, I felt that I was totally behind in territory with him getting nearly all of the bottom and two quite decent corners and my K7 stones not doing much, also I was now on time pressure but still can't say which move would have been good, I thought about N14 but discarded it because I thought he would just ignore so I tried to find a sequence where I maybe could cut him but already thought that he could connect or at least make connection to his top group, but I was desperate.

It would be nice if you could give me some general advice on such situations, it this is possible.

At least I felt that Black played very light and good.

Now I look at it maybe the simple cut at M9 best now?

kh: the cut should work, why not go ahead and cut?];W[il];B[hk]
;W[jj];B[ji];W[jk];B[ki];W[ii];B[kg];W[lf]C[Oc:

I feel like this was the losing move, maybe J14 better? Or cut at M9?

kh:
this move seems useless, M9 is simple and still works now.]

;B[qb];W[qc];B[lg];W[mf];B[mg];W[ng];B[db]C[Oc: I would have resigned now, but my oponnent was someone I play more often and I know he don't like when someone resigns so I tried some things to catch up.

kh: actually the game is still close after killing top right. M9 is still there.]

;W[fl];B[gl];W[fn];B[fk];W[gm];B[dk]C[kh: nice tesujis. now you are ahead by a little.]
(;W[bj];B[bk];W[cj]C[Oc: I thought black couldn't push through at C11, before he made his move I saw that he could so I  thought it would be better when I defend.]
;B[dm];W[bh];B[el];W[fm];B[ck];W[am];B[bm];W[eb];B[cb]
(;W[fc];B[ef]C[Oc:

Now I see this without time pressure, maybe play G14 and if black still plays E15, play F16 and if black captures play H17?]

C[Oc:

If you haven't already, you can feel free to stop the review here :-) I know I have lost already so I tried to find a sequence, was under time pressure and lost not only E15 but also H12, so I know that my oponnent would not be offended if I resign, so I did after losing both groups.

kh: you are not losing... even if your top group is dead.];B[ib]

Just for the protocol I knew before that F11 was already lost, but heard that often pro players play sequences that doesn't work and they know it before they resign, and I thought this was nice, not resign immidieatly but play some last stones before finally resigning.]
