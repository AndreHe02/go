;B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[cn];B[fp];W[dj];B[qf];W[pi]C[W10: could be an overplay and an error in direction: 

In general, pincer when you have a friendly stone to back it up. In this game the bottom right is black, not white, so the pincer is not backed up. Also, the presence of R5 makes the right side less developable than the top side (the right side is partly finished already). White can be content to answer R14 with O17, patience. Or, answer at O16 for a fighting stance.]
;B[of];W[nd];B[mf]C[B13: this move means Black intends to counter attack on a larger scale in exchange for giving White a benefit on the top side.]
;W[ld];B[qc]C[Overplay by black? S16 better? Or some othe=
r move to put pressure on Q11?

R17: inconsistent with N14. Counter attack at Q9.

At this moment it is far more important and interesting for black to counter attack the Q11 stone and to build a deep moyo. In contrast, the upper right corner is not important.]
;W[qd];B[rd]
(;W[pc]C[W18: slack. White should separate black. See variation. White has a chance to make the black stones on the 6th line useless.]

(;B[qb]C[B19: Must be S18 to maintain connection to the outside.]
;W[re];B[rc];W[qe];B[pb];W[ob];B[ra];W[pa]C[Bad move, I guess, since I spoil a big ko-threat
S13 the rigth move?

W26: not necessary at this moment. 

In general, timing in the go game is about playing moves at the last possible moment but not later. That is the moment they are the most effective. When moves are played too early they erase taste, and when too late they dont work or are too small.]
;B[sb]C[S14 better?];W[rg]C[W28: black has achieved 3 points of cash in the upper right while White has turned the 3 outside black stones into a liability for Black. White has control. (It would be better to play the forcing peep at Q13 before S13 because it strengthens the white position and makes the black position heavier.)]
;B[fc]C[With the weak black s=
tones to the right this invasion is perhaps a little premature? Would O11 o=
r O10 or something like that have  been better? Aiming at the cut at R12...=

B29: In general you must play urgent points before big points. B29 is a big point. But urgent points appear when you have a weak group (weak groups can be identified by having any or all of the basic three problems: shortage of liberties, connection defects, or no base.)  It is risky to open another front when you have an existing weakness.

Of course Black made a stretegic error on the top right. It is now unclear what Black can do. Nevertheless, R9, which makes some cash and indirectly help the weak stones may be better than F17 at this moment.]
;W[ic]C[W30: a pincer is natural. But since the white group in the upper right is very strong, White should go all the way to H17; moreover, since White wants to punish the weak 3 black stones, White should consider pincering on the 4th line, which emphasizes attack pressure over cash. So I suggest H16 as a better pincer at this moment.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[id]C[B33: of course if Black could make a central position and link with the 3 black stones on the top right in the process, it would be a success. But it is hare to see this happening without White's cooperation.]

(;W[jd];B[jc]C[B35: cross cut is often a maneuvre to achieve sabaki in the opponent's zone.]
;W[kc];B[jb]
(;W[ib]C[W38: as White I would want to stick to my "story" of pressuring the 3 weak outside stones. I value the outside more than the inside. Therefore, see J15 variation.]
;B[hc];W[ie];B[hd];W[hb]C[Clearly a mistake. K15 would put the right pressure on =
the weak black stones to the right, wouldn't it?

Yes, it is important.];B[je];W[kd];B[gb];W[kb]C[Horrible move, too. K14 better? Or perhaps rather=
 L14?

L18: endgame type move because the stability of your upper right stones in not in question (your base is secure whether you capture two black stone or not).]
;B[kf]C[Black got a good value for his sacrifice of two stones.]
;W[jf];B[ke];W[kg]C[W50: severe? Let's see if Black is intimidated.]
;B[lg];W[if];B[fg]C[B53: slack. The only move at this moment is L12, a free atari that makea white's shape sickly and helps the right side black group.]
;W[kh]C[W54: of course! White maintains control and Black suffers because his group on the right is weaker. White has gotton away with his double hane.]
;B[lh]C[Consider J12 immediately.];W[ki];B[li];W[kj];B[lk]MA[sa]

[cb][cc][cd][ce][cf][cg][ch][ci][cj][ck][cl][cm]C[Who is in the lead here?

N9 seem a more secure way to run compared with M9 leaving a cut point. ...

Ok, let's pretend we can figure out the score and answer your question. (I hope the game display program you're using shows all the symbols I have used to mark up the board; namely, Xs, triangles, diamonds and squares. Otherwise my comments won't make sense, assuming they make sense anyhow.)

X marks 18 points of black cash.
diamond marks 54 black moyo points, which can normally be expected to generate 18 points of black cash.
LETS GRANT BLACK 18+18=36.

traiangle marks 18 points of white cash on top.
square marks 39 white moyo points, which can normally be expected to generate 13 points of white cash.
White got komi? Normally that's 5.5 points.
LETS GRANT WHITE 18+13+5.5=36.5.

BUT,
White has sente, early on that's worth another 10.
Who can get more benefit from the center battle? White seems to have an edge, so let's award White a 5 points for that also.

So, in my estimation, White is somewhat ahead, and it could be by as much as 15.]
;W[dh]C[W60: of course its a big point. However during a running central battle, don't leave the fighting scene unless you absolutely must because of an incidental forcing move. 

Push through and cut and fight at M10. Keeping up the pressure means maintaining control of the game. That seems urgent.

Notwithstanding, D12 does indirectly weaken the entire upper left black stone group, so it is more than just a big point.]
;B[fj]C[B61: so now Black tries to take control of the game by counter attacking the center white group. Good thinking. But Black may have played J3 instead as a forcing move right away. In general attack heavy stones close and light stones far. Both the white and the black weak groups are, of course, heavy (neither side can sacrifice them without losing the game).]

(;W[ik]C[Probably K8 would be better? Any comments on the following moves would be=
 very welcome, too.

Correct, K8 is better for white. See variation.];B[jl];W[fk]
;B[gk];W[gj];B[fl];W[ek];B[hl];W[hk];B[gl];W[fi];B[db]C[D18: urgent move!]

(;W[kq]C[L3: the splitting paly is understandble, but isn't it better to counter attack black's upper group now that white's center group has settled? Push through and cut at N9.]
;B[iq];W[nq]
(;B[qk]C[Should the weak white stone's at the bottom=
 be attacked more directly? Where would be the best direct attack?

Normally punish the opponent's weak position right away; but, you must be able to see a benefit. If the benefit or direction is not clear, then wait.

You can pressure from inside or outside.];W[no];B[lr]
(;W[lq]C[M3: seems slack. Must be L2.];B[kr];W[mr];B[jq];W[or]
;B[pr];W[cb]C[M1 first?

M1 is endgame; it is a forcing move but doesn't make an eye.


Instead of C18 help the lower group with L5 while reducing the black zone.]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[cd]C[C16: just E16 sente is proper.];W[ce];B[bd]
;W[bc];B[be];W[bf];B[ns]C[O1: first E16 forcing move to secure this weak position in SENTE.]
;W[os]C[W96: dont answer on the first line, come out to center instead.]
;B[lo]C[Should white be able to live now? Any comments as to how black migh=
t kill or white live would be most welcome. Both here and in the subsequent=
 development.

My feeling is there "may" be enough play in this position for white to live. If Black can take cash benefits and solidfy his weaknesses all around while White lives in gote, its the commonly expected result.

M5 is a severe and nice attacking move.];W[ls];B[js];W[lp];B[mo]
;W[mp];B[ms];W[on];B[op];W[pk]C[W106:it weakens those black stones on top.]

(;B[il]C[J8: instead, Q7 maintains the pressure, takes a cash benefit, and help black's top stones indirectly.]
;W[gh];B[gg];W[jp];B[ip];W[io];B[jn]C[Black is fixated on killing white's group instead of attacking white's group.

Attack to gain varioius benefits (typically solidifying territory and fixing weaknesses in sente). Killing is only needed if you are so far behind you have no other chance or if you can read ahead to precisely see the kill or if your positional judgement is so refined that you know you can kill.]

B4 is bigger than R11.];W[bp]C[B4 should be C3 because destroying the bottom is destroying 4th line based cash versus the left 3rd line based cash.]
