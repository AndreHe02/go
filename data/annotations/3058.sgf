GC[I'd like this game to be reviewed because I don't know what went awry. There are a couple of blunders, above all the empty triangle around F13, but is this enough to explain why i didn't get a foot in the door?]


AB[pd][dp]C[Bashan [19k\]: dobry den

-hi my name is lect. i am 8k on KGS and i will be reviewing your game!]

Bashan [19k\]: cool!]V[30.9];B[cd]V[40.1];W[qo]C[this was probably too passive

-if you want to be a little bit more "aggressive" you might consider R6... but there is nothing wrong with forming a solid base for yourself in the corner]

V[40.1];W[jd]C[-because B's stones are on the 4th line, your stone should've been played along the 3rd line. it makes for a stronger invasion. you will see this later on in the game.]

V[34.7];B[qk]V[34.4];W[dj]C[I felt that it looked quite good at this point - I thought I had a lot of potential (with two miai extensions at the border). But maybe I overlooked that Black didn't really have any group that was in danger - so he had strong starting points.

-as i said earlier, K16 wasnt a good spot to invade. G16 and N16 aren't miai because they do not carry the same weight. N16 forms a much more solid foundation than G16. also, because your stone is on the 4th line, it will be tough to form a decent base. if your stone was on the 3rd line, then you could form a much better foundation with A or B. A or B would be miai.]
