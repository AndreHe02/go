A is the common move in this situation.];B[jd]C[The aforementioned attack on the lower-right corner group would be even stronger with this stone in place.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qf]LB[qe:A]C[This move is a special move that is played instead of A for one reason: sente. This move lets white get a little more territory than usual in exchange for a big move elsewhere on the board.]
;W[rf];B[qg]LB[rs:A][cc:B]C[This is inconsistent with 29. You should play elsewhere, like "A" or "B".]

(;B[fe]C[This is a good move. You can aim at a large center now.]
;W[ke];B[kd];W[le];B[ld];W[lh];B[lj]C[This attack seems a little too hopeful. White has too much space to spread out in, so killing is unlikely. Furthermore, at the end of the attack, 41 is not in a particular useful position. THAT IS, unless you plan on attacking the lower-right corner group. Then 41 would be an excellent move.]

You did a great job this game! It's great that you sent this game to GTL to get reviewed, because it's a fantastic resource for learning.

I had to hurry a little with this review, so I may have missed some things, but overall I think I got the most major points. Please sent my any questions you still have!


Good luck!

I can certainly understand concern over whether the marked is safe. However, in this case, white's group does not have a solid base so he cannot attack it very severely.]

You can play a ladder breaker or play something like B, forcing white to fix with C. Then you can jump out with D, a nice result.]
