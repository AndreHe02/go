C[   Hello, this is my first request for a review on GTL, and I hope it will make me play better in the future.
   I played B here (Sixpack), and felt I was behind for best part of the game, so I'm mostly interested in the beginning, and mid-game sequences.
   Thanks in advance for your time and effort, I really appreciate it.

F:  Hi,  I added some comments here and there. Hope you will find it useful.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]C[Low Chinese opening, I love to play it with B]
;W[jp];B[jd]MA[lp]C[F/ Alternative would be M4 (x)];W[mp];B[ce]
MA[po]C[F: Black could defend the corner at Q5 (x). Would be more consistent with moyo-strategy.]
;W[dh];B[fe];W[gc];B[bc]C[Idea was to establish a base for my team, and then, if have a chance, chase W team.
F: There is not much place to make a base for your own. see variation at next move]

(;W[ge]MA[hd]C[F: Shape is not so good. Better at H16 (x)]
(;B[ff]MA[gf]C[F: Better hane to put more pressure on white]

(;W[hf]C[Not so sure about this one, seems slow to me.
F: True , but fixes the shape more or less. alternative would be J18]

(;B[bh]C[F: Since C18 is still open, you could be more agressive here. See variation]
;W[qf];B[qh]C[In this position maybe O16/17 better?
F: I don't think so. This seems fine.];W[nc];B[pf];W[pg]
(;B[qg]C[F: Since this sequence leads to a unfavorable result for black in the game, you should maybe try P14. See variation]
;W[pe];B[of];W[oe]
(;B[og]C[F: I don' know the joseki, but here you have to cut. See variation]
;W[qd];B[rf];W[qe]C[Watching it now, I'm quite sure I got the worst of thi sequence.
F: Yes, see my earlier remarks];B[jg];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[pp]
;W[ql]C[Well, wasn't really expecting this from W
F: Just connect would be good enough for white];B[ro];W[pk]
;B[pj]MA[qj]C[F: Better nobi at R10. This way you're stronger to attack later.]
;W[ok];B[ck]MA[cn]C[F: Leaves the situation at the right side unsettled. Locally C6 would be bigger]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[cm]C[F: Good for white];B[fq]C[Any other idea for this move?
F: C3 or D3, but I'm not sure which is better. C3 is probably not good because it makes - after white D3 -  whites stones work good together]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[fr];B[bo]MA[fp][fq]C[F: Strange invasion point. You first have to settle your marked stones]
;W[bn]C[F: The corner is more important for white: B4 or C4]
;B[cp]
(;W[co]C[F: Very bad. Asks black to cut his stones. See variation]
;B[do];W[cn];B[dq];W[ep];B[er];W[eo];B[fo];W[en];B[gr];W[dr]
;B[fs];W[cq]C[F: White gets a big corner, but black can be satisfied with his ponnuki on the lower side.]

(;B[jr]SQ[fo][fp][fq][er][gr][fs]CR[jp][mp]C[F: There is no hurry to make a second eye here. You should try to make use of your marked stones to separate white and attack the marked white stones. See variation]
;W[ek];B[dj];W[fh];B[di]C[F: ??];W[eh];B[gg]C[This was the way I planned this sequence, in the end of it, I got the corner, while W settled entire upper side, IMHO the result was more or less equal]
;W[fj];B[fd];W[fc];B[gd];W[hd];B[hc];W[ic];B[hb];W[ib];B[id]
;W[he];B[fb];W[gb];B[ec];W[ha];B[eb]TR[id][jd][jg]C[F: The result is better for white, I think. The left side is still open and your marked stones come under attack.]
;W[hh];B[hg]C[F: Connect your stones to the right side is easier. You're cutting two living white groups]
;W[ig];B[ih]C[Maybe cut from the other side (J14)];W[if];B[jh]
;W[jf];B[lf];W[ke];B[le]
(;W[kd]C[F: No, M16];B[ld];W[lc];B[nd];W[oc];B[od];W[pc];B[mc]

[cr][aq][bq][dq][cp][bp][ap][ao][bo][do][dn]C[I was glad I got to play first in the center region, if W made some influence there, game would have been lost.
F: i don't think so. The centre is open to both sides, so there won't be much points to gain there for one or the other.
Time to look at the board and make an estimation of the situation. According to my rough count black is some 7 points behind on the board, so you should find a way to reverse the situation, e.g. by attacking the lower white stones.]
;W[nj];B[ni];W[mj];B[mi];W[lj]C[Too slow?
F: Yes];B[jj];W[bg]C[Nice idea, but it didn't work as W wanted]
;B[ch]
(;W[cg];B[dg];W[eg];B[df];W[ef];B[ee];W[ir];B[iq];W[kr]
(;B[hr];W[jq];B[is];W[re]C[F: Big, but P5 is bigger and safer]
;B[oo]C[Another key point imho
F: Right. THE keypoint];W[nr]
(;B[pn]C[Other ideas for this one?
F: Defend the corner AND get white separated. See variation]
;W[mn];B[qm];W[rm];B[pm];W[ml]C[Maybe too cautius for W
F: Probably. Taking at S9 is probably bettter.];B[rk];W[rl]
;B[rj];W[pl];B[li]C[I thought it was the right moment to fix the aji there]
;W[kk];B[jk];W[km];B[or]C[This move felt good during the game, it seems good now too:)

[mk][mr][mq][lq][kq][kp][lp][lo]C[OK, yose begins about here, IMHO W was still leading, but he made some misjudgements during the end-game moves
F: Let's count again.
White: 61
Black: 67
So, the game is about even.
