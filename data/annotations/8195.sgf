C[Dear reviewer,
I played this game as B and lost by quite a lot.
However, I think that up until B99 I was not so far behind. The biggest difficulty I have in general is the fuseki stage so I would appreciate any advice You might give me on how to improve that part of the game.
Thanks for the review!];B[qc];W[dq];B[cd];W[qp];B[do]C[Q: In the game I did not get a good result in the lower left part of the board so I am not sure if D5 was a good move or not. Would it be better if I had played C5?

klin: It has to do with your plan of the game. C5 and D5 both OK]
;W[dl];B[fo];W[fq];B[ho];W[hq];B[di];W[gl];B[cq]C[Q: At this point I had no idea what to play. I wanted to attack W but did not think of any good move so I played C3 to secure my group.
In retrospect I think this move was bad. What should I have played here?

klin: C3 a good move.];W[cr];B[cp];W[fc];B[ed];W[ci];B[ch]C[klin: C12 can consider C10 and fight]
;W[cj];B[dh]C[klin: Now B C12-D10 is too close to C16-E16];W[ic]
;B[ec]C[Q: Is this move ok or is it too small?

klin: OK];W[jp];B[qj]C[Q: I was worried about W making a double wing formation so I played R10. Waould it have been better if I played L17 instead?

klin: Since W did not respond to E17, so L17 is the better play.]
;W[lc];B[nc];W[cn];B[br];W[dr];B[em]C[klin: B E7 can play at J6 directly.  E7 helps W become stronger.]

;W[qq];B[rn];W[np];B[pn];W[on];B[om]C[klin: Now R10 is too close to the "wall" B is building.]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[rc];B[rb];W[qg];B[rf];W[rg];B[rd]C[klin: B S16 should R15]
;W[qf];B[qe]C[klin: Now, B r15 should S15];W[sf];B[re];W[ng]
;B[ne]C[klin: B Q15 can play at N15];W[ri];B[rj];W[fb];B[eb]

C[klin: Now, B M11 should attack from K13.  You can see B E7 and F7 have made W strong from D8 to G8.]

;W[dn];B[en];W[ep];B[eo];W[bf];B[ag]C[Q: This was a big overplay. Should I have played C14 earlier to secure the corner?

klin: B could.  But now B C14 W A13 B B15 W C13, B D14, not a big deal.]
;W[cg]C[klin: W C13 mistake, should C14, B in trouble.];B[cf]
;W[dg];B[be]C[klin: Now B B15 at E13 can kill W.  Please figure it out yourself.]
