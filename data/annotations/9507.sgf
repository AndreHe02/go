AB[dd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][pp]C[Review by Mat (~11 kyu)

Overall comments:

I think you played quite well strategically but were a bit overeager to attack early on, whereas later on you were too kind to white and missed some big oppurtunities to capture.

You should pay more attention to cutting points (your own and your opponents) and be careful about how you defend on the 1st and 2nd lines. There were a few places where you tried to hang on to too much territory and lost out because of it.]

C[This move was not so good I guess...

[Mat\] This move seems fine for closing off the corner but I think that it would be better to focus on keeping white's groups separated. The contact move at A would still attack the marked stone but leaves less options for white to fix it, plus it gives black the opportunity to extend out towards the centre instead of being confined to a low position.]

;W[fg];B[gf];W[bg];B[be];W[dh];B[ci]TR[ff][gf]C[[Mat\] I don't think this is a bad move, but it might be a little bit too aggressive. The marked black stones are quite weak so I would want to strengthen those before playing so close to white, even if it means white gets eye space on the left hand side.

Since it is a handicap game, white still has to work hard to secure territory so I think you can afford to play more defensively and focus on building influence.]
;W[ch];B[ei]LB[gg:b][bi:a]C[[Mat\] This move doesn't achieve much - white can still create eye space by descending at A or extending at B, and the left hand side is very open so white could invade there later in the game.]
;W[ej]TR[di]C[[Mat\] This seems odd for white. Black could just fill in here and white gains nothing.]
;B[ek];W[fj];B[fi];W[gk];B[fk];W[gj]
(;B[gi]MA[di][dk]CR[ei][fi]TR[ff][gf]C[[Mat\] There are two big cutting points for white here and the three black stones are heavy. If you want to chase white you need to fix the weaknesses first or white will get strong by capturing your stones.

There are a lot of possible variations here that would lead to fighting so it's very difficult for me to read, but a simple response would be to sacrifice some stones and just take some territory on the left instead (see variations). As long as the triangled stones don't die, the centre left isn't that big and there is plenty of territory to be made in the corners.

Even if black was stronger in the centre, I would still attack lightly and try to build territory with the attack. The white group has to run to get eye space, so strengthening the surrounding areas could keep the pressure on but still gain territory at the same time.]
;W[gm];B[fm];W[fn];B[em];W[di];B[ck];W[bi];B[bj]LB[cj:a][bk:b]
C[[Mat\] This could be played at A or B instead of starting a Ko.]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[bk];B[ci];W[hi];B[gh];W[cj];B[bl];W[aj];B[gg]
;W[eg];B[ig];W[hl];B[ii];W[ij];B[ik]C[[Mat\] Attacking here does not gain you much. There is loads of open space on the bottom side that is much bigger.]
;W[hk];B[jk];W[ji];B[ih];W[ki];B[hj];W[cn]C[[Mat\] This seems premature]
;B[dn]C[[Mat\] Good response];W[ij];B[co]C[[Mat\] This is good, the bottom left looks much more secure now.]
;W[hj]C[[Mat\] I don't think c];B[kl]C[[Mat\] I like this move as well, white now has two heavy groups and all the black groups now have enough breathing room.]
;W[bm];B[cm];W[al];B[bn];W[cl];B[dl];W[en];B[bl]TR[jn][im][jm]
C[[Mat\] This is quite small at this point in the game, both groups are alive so you should focus on the corners and sides.

You could play somewhere near the triangled area to take away the white's groups eyespace and extend towards the bottom. If you chase white out you can build up a nice moyo in the bottom right quarter of the board.]
;W[ke];B[kg]C[[Mat\] Another good move - black is in a strong position at this stage in the game]
;W[cl]C[[Mat\] I don't know why white focused so much on this area - the top and centre are very vulnerable and there is still lots of unclaimed territory.]
;B[fl];W[lh];B[lg];W[mh];B[mg];W[ng];B[nf]LB[nh:a]C[[Mat\] You could also cut at A]

;W[pi];B[qi];W[oj];B[qj]LB[pk:a]C[[Mat\] This seems a bit passive, might be better to keep going at A.]
;W[ph];B[ol]C[This move was a mis-click which turns out to be just fine...]
;W[qn]MA[hi][hl][gm][ej][fj][gj][hj][ij][gk][hk][en][fn]CR[ol]
SQ[jj][lj][kl][ik][jk]LB[on:A][qo:B]C[A or B? Which is better?

[Mat\] Both are good locally - B favors the corner whereas A gives you outside influence.

I prefer A in this case because it supports the square and circle stones and gives you a great base from which to attack the white group marked with X. Any territory you lose on the right you can make up for on the bottom side.]
;B[qo];W[on];B[np];W[mn]C[[Mat\] This is bad news because it threatens to split off black's group in the centre, which is not alive yet.]
;B[qq]TR[lp][im][in][jn][jo][jp][kn][ko][kp]C[cowardly...

[Mat\] I think you should keep the pressure on the two white groups instead of defending the corner here.]
;W[jp]C[[Mat\] This is a big point for both players. Now white has somewhere for the centre group to run to and limits blacks expansion along the bottom side.]

(;B[ml]C[[Mat\] This links up your groups, but I don't think it is your only option for keeping it alive, since white's groups are still very vulnerable. See variation for an example.]
;W[hn];B[go];W[gn];B[gp];W[dq]C[how to respond to this move?

[Mat\] Maybe just connect up your stones and concede the corner. The bottom side is more important since you have two large groups you can attack there.]

(;B[lp]LB[mo:a][lq:b]C[can't cut here?

[Mat\] I don't think so, as white can surround the cutting stone. But you could try at A instead which looks a bit more promising (see variation)

At the very least you could peep at B and get some territory out of it.]

;B[oq];W[mr];B[nr];W[or];B[mq]MA[bj]LB[nr:a][or:b]C[[Mat\] This exchange is a little strange and looks very similar to what happened over on the left earlier in the game. The ko doesn't seem worth it compared to just playing A at B in the first place, since there is very little at stake for white.]
;W[cb];B[bc];W[nq];B[ns];W[os];B[pr]C[[Mat\] Should have retaken the Ko here, or returned to the top left.]

;W[sn];B[sp];W[rs]CR[qr][rr]C[[Mat\] This doesn't work for white as black can easily create two eyes.]
;B[rr];W[pm];B[pl];W[pn];B[ho]LB[sm:A]C[Maybe A is better?

[Mat\] H5 has a chance of killing a white group so it is far bigger than A, which is only worth a few points. It might have been worth playing A a couple of moves ago though when it was sente for black.]

(;B[im]MA[in]C[[Mat\] Why not cut here? White is so close to being killed! See variation.]

;W[lb];B[ma];W[qb];B[jf];W[la];B[lm];W[bb];B[ab];W[aa]C[[Mat\] White can't live here, black should just cut off the escape route.]

(;B[ba];W[ca];B[ac];W[ea]
(;B[db]C[[Mat\] You can use a throw in to reduce white's liberties here. There's still a ko to win but I think it's worth a try - see variation.]

(;B[sl]C[Turned out to be a disaster...

[Mat\] It's only a small loss, but you should be careful about overstretching yourself like this instead of playing something more secure that concedes a couple of spaces (compare the variation to the next few moves)]
