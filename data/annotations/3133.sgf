C[Hi, here is a game I played on IGS. I played black in this game and I lost by a big margin. I would like to see what I could had done better and what parts of the game that I should improve most urgently.

I tried a fuseki which I do not use alot regurlarly since I felt i got stuck in my normal rutine. This probably means that I could probably use some extra pointers here.

Thank you for reviewing.


Black did better in the opening than white did.   White created many weak groups.   Black lost because he failed to capitalize on them]
