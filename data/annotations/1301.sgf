C[dear reviewer,
 i was black in this game, and it is sort of typical of my problems.
im a 30kyu beginner, and i find myself always struggling to connect.

I relize that i lost this game by a lot (over 30pts) but somehow
thought it should have been closer.  was i right?

i  am interested in 2 things:

1) specific comments about stupid moves i made
2) general comments about weaknesses in my game and suggestions
about what i should study-

thank you];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[id]TR[qn][ep][eq]C[Black's opening moves so far are called the Chinese opening.
It is a reasonable way to start, but I don't use it personally
since I haven't studied it much.  If you do plan to use it regularly,
then you should study it.

I would have played an approach move at one of the triangles.
None of the corners are really secure yet, so Black can easily
move in and take at least some profit in either of White's areas.

An approach move is intentionally flexible.  Depending on how
your opponent responds, you can move into the corner or up the
side.  You should be ready to do either, don't get fixed on just
one of those options.  You may go in planning to take the corner,
but be ready to change plans if White decides to defend the corner
at all costs.  The opening requires much flexibility
and a willingness to change plans as you go.];W[iq]C[White appears to be trying to secure more territory by playing
on the third line here.  I don't think this move will be much
better for securing territory than Black's move.  White's stone
is fairly
far away from both corners, so Black can still invade on either
side of it.

This move does follow a "rule of thumb" to try balancing
your opening moves between the third and fourth lines.];B[dj]
TR[pj][qn]C[I would play on the right side here at one of the triangles.

White's lower right stone is on the 4x4 point.  This makes it
easier for Black to approach and "dive under" that stone into
the corner.  After Black's current move it will be hard to push
into the lower left corner.];W[pj]TR[qn][nq][mq][fq]C[This is a prime time for an invasion.  The opening is essentially
over since both sides have "staked a claim" to a large portion
of the board.

Now Black should be thinking about how to invade White's areas.

Some nice invasion points are marked with triangles.  All of
the marked invasions offer three options for Black, depending
on White's response.  They are listed in order  with the first
choice being the best in general.
1) run out into the middle
2) invade the near-by corner.
3) crawl along the side.]
(;B[do]TR[dq]C[was this the right move?

This is too close to White's stone.  Playing here is a contact
play even though the stones don't actually touch.  This means
Black is starting a contact fight.  Contact fights tend to strengthen
both sides.  So, the best use of a contact play is to strengthen
one of your weak groups by contacting a
strong opponent's group.  This way, your weak group will get
strong as the contact fight progresses.  The opponent's group
is already strong, and there is not much benefit in making a
strong group stronger.

If you want to play a contact fight
here, I would suggest the triangle.  This makes a weak Black
group that you can strengthen as the contact fight goes on.  This play is also an invasion of the corner.
See the variations.];W[dp];B[co];W[ep];B[eo]TR[ap][bp][fp][gp]
[hp][ir][is][ip]SQ[ao][bo][en][em][el][ek][ej][cj][bj][aj]C[This is not a great exchange for Black.  White gets a lot of
corner territory, while Black works on securing the lower left
side.  The corner looks bigger than the side, however.  Imagine
how many points would be surrounded if both sides just fill in
the walls around these areas.  I have marked out the area each
side is expecting to have as territory.  Black has 16 points
while White has 24.];W[qf];B[nd]TR[qn][nq][mq]C[This is usually a good response to a White approach move.  It applies more to the opening, however.  Here it seems a bit
too passive.  White has claimed a new portion of the upper right
side with the last move.  Black's move does not claim any new
territory in response, however.  Another good option here is
to ignore White's move and play your own invasion.

One way to respond to an opponent's move is to make a similar
move elsewhere on the board.  For example, White played a corner
approach move here.  Black can responed defensively or could
attack by playing an approach/invasion against White.  If White
continues to play in the upper right corner, Black can do a similar
amount of damage to the White in the lower right.];W[ed];B[de]
TR[db][gc][df]C[This is too close to White.  This is another contact play.  Here,
Black's two stones in the corner are strong while White's invading
stone is weak.  A contact fight will strengthen White a lot.
Since Black is already strong, there is less gain for Black.
Play a bit farther away to cut White off from eye space and drive
White into the center.  The triangles are good ways to attack
White here.];W[ee];B[df];W[hc]
(;B[ef]TR[ic]SQ[dc]C[This is bad.  This move appears to be trying to keep White out
of the center.  White can live in the upper side, however, so
blocking the center doesn't threaten White with serious harm.
Black should play at the triangle to keep White out of the upper
right side.  Another option is to block the corner at the square.
Either of these will encourage White to run into the center.
Black can build a nice wall along the left side while chasing
White into the center.  See the variation.];W[dc];B[hd]TR[ic]
C[Again, the triangle is better.  Black can't kill White here.
White has too much space available to make eyes along the top.
So don't bother trying to kill White.  White will have to try
to make a live group whether or not you try to actually kill
here.  So instead, contain White and build up your territory
on either side as White struggles to make a live group.

Don't try to kill when you know you will probably fail.  Instead,
torture
the weak group and make lots of territory around it as it struggles
to live.  Even when White succeeds in living, you will still
have gained a lot from the exchange.];W[gd];B[ge];W[fd]C[Black has let White have a large portion of the upper left side
and corner in exchange for a wall that faces down the left side.
Since Black is already strong on the left side, there isn't much
use for this wall.  White has come out ahead in this exchange.]
;B[fp]TR[ad][bd][ao][bo][dn][dm][dl][dk][di][dh][dg]SQ[fp][eo]
[do][co][id][hd][ge][ef][df][de][cd]C[This just gives White a chance to secure the territory on the
lower left.  Black isn't really making any territory here in
exchange since the center is still too open to be actual territory.

Even with the walls marked by squares Black can't really expect
to have much territory beyond the fourth line on the left side
(as marked with triangles).  Look at the end of the game and
see how this is actually what happened.];W[fq];B[gp];W[gq];B[ip]
TR[gn]C[This doesn't accomplish much for Black.  If White plays somewhere
around the triangle, all of the territory Black is trying to
secure above the last few moves will vanish.  Meanwhile,  the
lower left side can no longer be invaded and is secure territory
for White.];W[hp];B[ho];W[hq];B[io]TR[ic][lq][mq][nq][qn][qd]
[qh]C[This connection is good locally to protect some cutting points
here.  However, there are a lot of moves worth more points elsewhere.

It is OK to leave a cutting point if you have more important
moves available.  All of the triangles are worth more than any
cut White could make around move 35.];W[gj]C[This is an excellent move by White.  Black has to pick a side
for a response and white should be able to erase a lot of potential
territory on whichever side Black does not choose.];B[fh]TR[el]

C[was this correct- have i already lost the game at this point?

I would have responded at the triangle.  That would secure the
lower left side.  The lower Black wall is stronger, so I think
more territory can be made down there than on the upper left
side.
If White runs out to the center, Black can follow up at the square
and secure even more territory.   Also, Black could ignore this move
and invade near the lower right corner.

I have place Xs around the areas that I think are essentially
secure territory at this point.  So, at this point I would say
the score is White 47 and Black 41.  Black is behind at this
point, but only by 6 points.  There is still plenty of time to
make up 6 points.];W[ij];B[ih]C[This is a good followup move.]
;W[kj];B[gl];W[hl]TR[kh]SQ[if][kc]C[This is not bad, but I think White should play at the triangle
since it sets up a nice follow up play for White at either of
the squares.];B[gn]TR[gk][hm]SQ[gl]C[I would prefer one of the triangles.  The Black stone marked
with the square is in a contact fight now.  A good rule of thumb
is don't leave a contact fight until your group is either dead
or has more than 4 liberties.  Both of the triangle moves increase
the Black stone's liberties while reducing White's liberties.]
;W[jm];B[nq]C[This invasion is still a good move even this late in the game.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[pn];B[kp]C[This was a nice exchange for Black.]
;W[cc];B[bc]TR[bd]C[Playing here leaves some potential cutting points.  Playing at
the triangle is more secure but is worth about 1 point less for
Black.];W[gk]SQ[gl]C[Now the Black stone in the unresolved contact fight is under
a lot of pressure.]
(;B[fk]TR[fl]C[Playing at the triangle is more secure with fewer cutting points.
See the variation];W[fj];B[ek];W[ej];B[dk];W[ei]
(;B[di]C[is e12 better?

Not really.  This move is more secure and White will have no
place to cut.  See the variation for one way e12 could work out
badly for Black.];W[eh];B[dh];W[gm];B[fm]
(;W[hm]TR[fl]C[White should capture here.  See the variation]
;B[hn]TR[go]SQ[ic][qd][jr][nr][bb]C[This move doesn't do much for Black.  White can't cut here since
Black can always connect at the triangle.  Black should look
for a move worth more.  All of the squares are good moves.  J17
is the biggest move.  It secures a lot of territory along the
upper right in Sente];W[ln];B[lh]C[Black should focus on securing or attacking the sides.  Don't
bother trying to make territory in the center until all of the
corners and sides are secure.];W[ld];B[ph]TR[qh]SQ[nl]C[First, it is risky to ignore White's invasion unless you have
an even bigger counter-invasion in mind.

Secondly, this isn't an invasion.  It is a "light reduction"
and in this case doesn't reduce White by much at all.  If you
want to invade now, then try one of the marked moves.

The triangle can run out to the center or try to connect under
White to the upper right corner.  It could even try to make life
along
the side.

The square can run up or down depending on White's response.]
;W[qh]C[Now White is more secure along the side thanks to Black's "reducing"
move.];B[nj]
(;W[of]TR[qc]SQ[ld]C[Instead of this move, White should invade at the triangle now.
Since Black ignored the invading stone marked by the square,
White has the potential to erase most of Black's upper right
side and corner territory.

don't need to run out to the center at this point.   Also, running
