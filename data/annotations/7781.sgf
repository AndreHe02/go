AB[pd][dp]C[Hello!  I'm Ted Schuerzinger, and I've been given your game for review. I've preceded all my comments with my name.

I think there are a few simple things you could do to improve your game:

1. Look at the entire board.  A lot of the time, especially in the opening, you seemed more focused on just harassing one group than on how treating it might have further consequences around the board.  The adage goes, "Make territory while attacking", and although I'll admit that it's often not easy to figure out how to do, it's valuable advice.

2. Take some time to think about your response, rather than just playing the immediate reply.  (Of course, this also means playing some games that aren't blitz games.)]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[nc];B[lc];W[pb];B[qc]C[Ted: You might want to try O16, with the point of trying to force White to make a small life in the corner.  Either White does that, or has to run.  One doesn't want to kill every single opposing group, but force them to live small, while you take profit elsewhere.]
;W[ne];B[pg];W[qn];B[ql];W[rp];B[qq]C[Ted: Again, the same situation as in the top right.  This time, though, you've already got a fairly strong group up there, so I'd play P8, which aims to expand the Black group while making it more difficult for White to run out.]
;W[qj];B[qh]C[Ted: Here, you definitely should have jumped out from the other side.  The point is to keep the two White groups disconnected from each other.]

(;B[cl]C[Ted: I'm not so sure I care for this move.  The thing is, even if White gets to play at, say, E6 next, the three stones are still a bit too far apart]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[bl];B[bk];W[bm];B[cm]C[Ted: I don't like this move, because of the cut at C8.  I think I'd play C10 instead.]
