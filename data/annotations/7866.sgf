AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi,

I am Amygdala, 1d EGF and I will do the commentary for Jepper. Henceforth I will mark my comments with "A:" and Jepper's with "J:".

J:
Hi! Thanks for reviewing this game!
I took 5 stones against white. I did some experimentation in the opening but it turned out really silly and ridiculous. I believe white's invasion (move 87) and the ensuing fight were the highlights of this game.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[jp];B[lq];W[mp]LB[lp:A][jq:B]C[J:
I was doing some experimentation here; unfortunately, I didn't know how to respond to this.

A:
There are two natural choices, A and B. Let us figure these out.]

(;B[np];W[mq];B[no];W[lr]C[A:
Now white is very lucky.];B[oq]LB[jd:A]C[A:
Absolutely not important now. Better at "A" or something alike.]
;W[dk];B[di]C[A:
Very good! The right spirit of attack.];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[fq]

What's the best place to respond here?];W[dq];B[eq];W[bq];B[cp]
;W[er];B[fr];W[ds]TR[bq][cq][dq][er]C[A:
Triangled is the "Regular J-group". Four an in-depth discussion see J. Davies, "Life and Death", pp. 110.]
(;B[bs]LB[aq:A]C[A:
Fine! Usually, this one kills. This one and A are proper alternatives.]
;W[br]
(;B[fs];W[cs]C[A:
Now YOU are tricked.];B[iq]C[J:
I was being silly.

A:
Right you are.];W[jn];B[kq]C[J:
The next few moves were played without thought and in haste.

A:
Preferably send in games for commentary, in which you did NOT play in thought and haste. Otherwise you could waste the time of the commentator.]
;W[jq];B[kr];W[jr];B[mr];W[ks];B[nr]LB[jd:A]C[A:
Once again, absolutely not important. What about A?];W[ep];B[eo]
C[J:
What do you think about the following moves?

A:
You should be the one who captures.];W[fp]

;B[ik];W[ap];B[hn];W[qf];B[qh]C[J:
I was also thinking about something around O17. Was this the correct choice? I figured I had a lot of stones on the lower right.

A:
The clamp is nice and active in that context.];W[qc];B[qd]C[J:
Was this choice okay? I wanted to make something on the right side.

A:
Fine.];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc];B[pf];W[nd]

I played here because I didn't want white playing at N8.

A:
Well done!];W[ng];B[ph];W[oh];B[nh]C[J:
I really wanted to capture the O10 stones (totally ignoring the rest of the board, much less the stones in the middle) ^^]
;W[pg];B[oi];W[og];B[ni];W[mj];B[lh];W[pi];B[mg]C[J:
I was also thinking about M11.

A:
The latter would have been better, as it offers fewer sente-moves to white.]

(;B[lc]C[A:
You are just letting the o10 stones off the hook! See variation...]
;W[me];B[jd]LB[ll:A]C[J:
Was black 136 and 138 necessary at this time, especially with the center stones in danger? What do you think?

A:
A would stillbe possible...];W[ri];B[rh];W[ki];B[jh];W[ji];B[ii]

I was also thinking about playing H14 but I figured I could fight it out (and I was greedy with the upper side).

A:
But actually you could not fight it out. H14 is compulsory.]

By move 201 both players had so little time left; the subsequent moves were played in haste.

You fuseki cannot be calles silly. That is much too hard!
In fact, you dealt pretty well with the white invasion at 87, but you did not properly persue things to the end.
Actually you did not play so bad. You might improve your knowledge of corner positions and stress fighting exercises  a little bit more. Then you will quickly improve.]
