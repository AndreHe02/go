C[Hi!  I'm mwigdahl on KGS, and I generally bounce around 15k to 16k.  I'll summarize the game as I see it up front here and give specific comments and variations as we come to them in the file.

Although white got beaten pretty soundly, both sides made significant mistakes and left openings, and through most of the game things really could have gone either way.  Black generally did a bit better in keeping groups connected, making sure he had enough eye space for his groups, and controlling the tempo of the game.

It also looks as if the time control here was pretty short.  Quick games are fine but particularly at the beginner level you should look to use a bit more time per side so that you can practice reading a bit.  Certainly don't agonize over every move, but 15 minutes or so per side before byoyomi would probably be better until you get up to the 20k range or so.

There are a lot of strategic-level and tactical-level mistakes that beginners often get into.  I've seen some of all of these in your game, to a greater or lesser degree.  I'll point out cases as we come across them.  Working on understanding where these mistakes are coming in and on correcting them will yield huge, rapid improvements in your game.

Strategic mistakes:

1.  Overaggression.  Trying to kill everything is a huge mistake.  Generally you can't do it and attempting to kill everything leaves your own groups weak and scattered.  It's MUCH better to concentrate on containing and reducing your opponent's groups.  You'll build stronger groups and keep your opponent's territory smaller.

2.  Overemphasis on territory, particularly early in the game.  You can really make mistakes by getting too attached to specific pieces of territory.  If your opponent invades or reduces, try to find a way to get compensation elsewhere.

3.  Underemphasis on keeping sente.  Controlling the tempo of the game is crucial; the more you can keep sente and initiate plays that your opponent must respond to, the better you'll come out in the exchanges.

Tactical mistakes:

1.  Failure to secure life.  This is a big one for you.  The bigger your groups get, the more important it is to make sure they can live.  You don't need to waste moves to make sure eyes immediately if you can see that they can't be taken away from you, but when you have a big group under attack you need to assure its safety if you can't afford to give it up.

2.  Allowing groups to be cut apart.  This one is almost as big for you.  You usually can't stop your opponent from cutting somewhere, but you can attack the cutting stones.  If you capture them, you not only reconnect your groups but often end up with a free eye and a strong position in the bargain.  If you can't stop your groups from being separated, usually putting pressure against the cutting stones will at least allow you to take some compensation in outside thickness.

3.  Unwillingness to sacrifice when required.  Sometimes a sacrifice of one or two stones can hold your opponent to a small territory while you develop strongly around the outside.  On the other hand, trying to save everything can mean you lose everything.

Enough for now.  Let's get to the game!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec]
C[Interesting choice of corner point.  I'm not familiar with 3-5 openings, although that's certainly an acceptable point.]
;B[de];W[dd]LB[bd:C][cd:A][ce:B]C[I was not sure what was the best response for white. Can you please tell me ?

*****

Well, that depends on what you are trying to do.  When Black approaches like this he's usually trying to trade you control of the corner for a strong position on the side.  The standard response is at "A", which makes a nice shimari to close off the corner, and threatens to cut under Black and force him into the center.  Black would normally respond at "B", then White "C".  Black is then free to extend down the side.

Your play at the star point doesn't do much to protect the corner, nor does it attack the black stone.  Direct contact plays are generally defensive, counterintuitive as that may seem.  Play non-contact moves (like the shoulder hit at "A") for attack.]
;B[ce];W[cc];B[ci]LB[ee:A]C[The situation ends up not too far from where the moves I indicated would end up, but in this case it's Black that has good followup moves for later rather than White.  "A" is a pretty big point for later.  Consider what a White play there would lead to as opposed to a Black play.]
;W[nq];B[lq]LB[qq:A]C[Black tries a close squeeze play against White.  A common response would be for White to jump in at "A", leading to these variations...]

(;W[pq]C[You chose to contact.  This can work also but it's generally seen as inferior.]
;B[qq]LB[op:B][qp:A][or:E][pr:D][qr:C]TR[lq]C[what would be the best response here ? now I think i should have played p2, then if b q2 then w p3 or r2

*****

Well, it's hard to say.  You could crosscut to "A", counter-hane to "B" or "C", or drop down to "D", although "D" looks cramped.

"A" looks like it would aim at sacrificing a stone to get a better position, "B" seems to work more toward attacking the marked squeezing stone.  "C" looks like it would be aimed at taking the corner from Black, and "D" might prepare for more fighting.

Your suggestion of "E" I personally wouldn't play, the reason being that it does nothing to either defend the White stones or attack Black.  White is still too cramped -- "E" gives no eye space potential, and the pressure is off of Black.

If "E" were played, Black should probably ignore it and play elsewhere, maybe extending on the right.]
;W[qr];B[oq];W[pr]C[Good move.  You are well-positioned to either take the corner or escape into the center now.]
;B[or];W[qp];B[rq];W[op]C[Another good move.  Black now has to choose which side to save.]
;B[po]LB[np:A]C[He chose the right.  Had he played at "A" he could have saved the left.]
;W[rp];B[rr]LB[nr:A][os:B]C[He plays it out in the corner, though, giving you a chance to recover.  "A" or "B" are required to save White's position.]
;W[os]C[Good.];B[oo]LB[np:B][nr:A]TR[lq]C[You have a choice here.  You can capture at "A" or extend to "B".  In my opinion, extending to B is a much better choice.  The two black stones are still dead, and you will have the opportunity to cut off the marked stone.

If you play at "A", Black can play at "B" and try to get you to connect.  You don't have to -- you could try to kill the three black stones in the corner to live, but Black will be able to connect to the marked stone and get a good outside position.]
;W[nr];B[ro]LB[np:A]C[Black doesn't exploit the opening at "A", instead capturing your two stones with the belly tesuji.]
;W[sp]LB[jd:F][ee:C][qi:G][cl:D][no:A][mp:B][iq:E][rs:H]TR[lq]
C[white move here is nonsense, sorry

***

Yep, White is dead.  You would have been better to play at any of the marked points.

A and B protect your White stones while threatening Black.  C hems in Black while setting up a nice extension on the top.  D stops Black from extending further down the left, E strongly attacks the marked Black stone while making a nice extension from your corner, F is a nice extension on the top, and invading at G would break up Black's potential territory on the side.  H is a nice sente move that assures life for White and forces Black to capture the cut off White stones or lose his own stones in the corner.

I think H in sente followed by E, or just E is the strongest combination.]
;B[qo];W[nc]C[This is fine too, another move against the black corner.  It's important to make sure black doesn't make another strong wall on the right, though, or you could lose the whole thing.]
;B[lc]C[Another squeeze play.];W[ne]LB[qc:A]C[This is legitimate.  You could also have jumped in to "A".]
;B[pf];W[ld]LB[jc:A]C[I'm guessing you are trying to take the upper side here.  I would have played "A" instead to force black to run out into the center.]
;B[kd]
(;W[ke]C[what would be the best response here ? i think playing m15 was better because it makes an extended table...

***

m15 would be much better shape.  Check the variation on the previous move for what this might have looked like.]
;B[md]C[Now black will try to cut you apart.];W[le];B[nd]C[black cleverly cuts my group off, again.

***

Well, he pushed through your one-point jump, but you are not at all dead yet.  See the variations for what could have happened next.]

(;W[kc]C[Now black can truly cut you off.  Compare to the variation and see what a difference this makes!]
;B[mc];W[oc]C[Not a good move.  It's not a compelling threat to black and there's little eye-making chance with such a strong black group around it.]
;B[pc];W[jd]C[Probably wise to take this while you can, but it does give up sente, allowing black to make big territorial moves...]
;B[me];W[mf];B[pj]C[... like this one.  Black takes profit on the right.  Extension should probably have been one point higher up.]
;W[cl];B[fq]C[Black approaches to make more territory on the bottom.]
;W[eq]LB[iq:A]C[Probably not good.  Black is already far from support, so by contacting him you just invite him to build a wall and defend his lower side.  A squeeze at A would have been interesting, as it would have attacked on both sides at once.]
;B[fp];W[mb]LB[lb:A][mb:1]C[i had no clue what i was doing here after this move in this side :(

*** 

Well, it looks like you were trying to connect to your two stones in the corner.  But your surrounding position is weak and when black drops to A, as you know he will, he now has access to the top.

It would be best to write off your stones in that corner as a loss, but if you really wanted to save them you should have played at A instead.  At least then when black dropped to 1 you'd still have a good chunk of the top.]
;B[lb];W[nb]C[Adding stones to an effectively dead group.];B[od]
;W[pb];B[qb]C[You don't have eye space without trickery in the corner.  One more stone to the right and you could live.

I don't see a living variation (not that there isn't one, but it would be tough.]
;W[qa];B[rb]C[An interesting variation:]
(;W[la]LB[ma:A]C[There's a proverb that two hanes equal one liberty.  Unfortunately, they don't equal an extra eye.  The throw-in at A kills you.]
;B[kb]C[Black knows you are dead so he tries to exploit your top area.]
;W[oa];B[ma]C[You force him to kill you with the throw-in.]
;W[na]LB[jb:A]C[Now you are still dead and he has sente again.  This is a disaster!  Much better to have played at A in the beginning to stop the bleeding as soon as possible.]
;B[hc]LB[ib:A]C[Looks like black is hoping to play A next and grab the top for himself.]

(;W[ic]LB[ka:B][jb:A]C[You try to stop him from succeeding in that.

A would have stopped that play and would force B.  Do you see why?  Examine the variation from last turn to see.]
;B[ib];W[jb];B[ja]C[And he's out.  White is looking very weak on top now.]
;W[hb];B[ia];W[jc];B[hd]C[Black looking to kill white's big group.]
;W[oh]C[???  You have a very weak group on the verge of being surrounded on top.  It's not dead, but if you let black have more free moves up there it might end up dead.

This is actually not a bad reducing move, but you need to secure life or at least get your big groups out of immediate jeopardy before you worry about the other guy's territory too much.]
;B[ng]TR[oh]C[Looks like black is trying to cut the marked stone off as well as keep the pressure up on the top white group.]
;W[nf];B[og];W[ph];B[nj]C[Now black has your two stones surrounded on a large scale.  Best to leave them alone and concentrate elsewhere unless you have a plan for winning the resulting fights.  But this is black's home turf; you will have difficulty living here.]
;W[jp]C[This is good.  One point lower might be as good.];B[lo]
C[Black runs out.  Unfortunately, he doesn't have to run far or you could make a lot of strength chasing him.]
;W[nh];B[mg];W[lg];B[mh];W[pg]LB[lh:A]C[Not sure what you were intent on here.  The white stones look doomed to me.  Adding more stones to the group is not helping.  Maybe A instead to try to keep black contained on the right.]
;B[of];W[mi]LB[lh:A]C[By trying to save both groups you may have lost them both.  Black will play at A and white is looking very troubled.]
;B[lh]C[it seems black is always a step ahead of me + my groups are always cutoff...

white is destroyed :( in center, sides, corner, .. really embarassing

***

This is because black keeps his groups solid and connected, and white's groups are weak and separated.  When you get into a situation this dire, you need to look hard at what you think you can salvage.  At this point I'd give up the right side stones as lost and concentrate on living on top first.  Then I'd try to reduce the left and bottom as much as possible.  You just can't save everything.]
;W[li];B[ni];W[qf];B[qe];W[oe];B[pe];W[lf];B[kh];W[kg];B[jh]
;W[jg];B[ig];W[if];B[hg];W[hf]LB[ie:B][je:A]C[White is now alive (as far as I can see) -- can live with A or B or escape to the left if black plays there.  Time to move on.]
;B[jn]C[Black makes a play for the bottom.];W[ho];B[fn];W[dn]
;B[hm];W[hn]LB[lp:A][gq:C][kr:B]C[Contact plays are for defense.  All this does is let black make a thick wall to hold you in.

You could have tried breaking out with A (you'd have to fight) or making some eye space with B and C, which are both sente.]
;B[gm];W[hq]C[Not enough eye space.  Now black will constrict the net.]
;B[jr];W[fr];B[gr];W[er];B[gq];W[gp]LB[go:A][io:B][iq:C]C[There's no way this move can get you an eye.  Black A, B, and C are all variants of the eye-stealing tesuji.]
;B[go];W[hp];B[em]C[This is a weak move by black, giving up sente.  You should take advantage of it to play a big point or fight your  way out of the bottom (not sure it's possible now, though).]

(;W[dm]LB[cm:A][dm:1]C[Why play here?  There was little threat.  Even if black cut with A, white at 1 protects well.  See last variations for some examples.]

*****

I don't think so.  There just isn't enough eye space available to live, and black is too well connected to try to kill.  There _might_ be something you could do to cut off and kill the marked black stones, but it would be a tough fight at best.  You just don't have enough liberties, it doesn't seem like.]
