C[Hello. My screen name is Creedfox. I would like to thank you for your time and expertise put into reviewing my game. I used to actually be very good at go, but i have not been able to play for a while and got a little rusty. I'm hoping that i can regain my former skills after some reviews. I played black, but comments about the other player's moves are appreciated too when apropriate. Thanks again :)

My name is Jim and I'll be reviewing your game.];B[pp]C[or0138: Hi!]
;W[dp];B[pc]C[i usually play my stones two different ways in a corner. that way i don't become too consitant.

Well, there's really no "right" move at this point anyway -Jim]
;W[dd];B[pe]C[I was temtped to move D10. But the shimari seemed well enough.

Shimaris are big in opening, I'd say the two moves are about equal.]
;W[dj]C[And then he took it.

So, you should now take YOUR big point @ K16, that's what your shimari is designed for.]

(;B[cm];W[pj];B[pl];W[pg]
(;B[qg]C[Looking back, was this too agressive?

Well, yes!!  There's a general rule of thumb that says you should aim to seal a group off before you take away its eyes, and there's another principle that says when you touch a weak stone you make it stronger.  K16 is still big, as is K4, this move doesn't help you very much.

(;B[co]C[This is better @ B4];W[do]C[No one ever defended like this.....

Well....if he can end in sente then this makes a nice wall facing open space for him.]

A15 was small, it's response was almost as small.....]
(;B[ah]C[This move isn't needed right now....];W[gd]C[This jump is so timid......K16 is much better]
;B[hc]C[I avoided my temptations to move into the area at the top above that wall he built.

This is a bit far from your home base, if I were white I would invade somewhere in between now]

(;W[gc];B[kc];W[hb];B[ic];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[jc];W[fb]C[This move has no point, free turn for black]

(;B[kl]C[i actually meant to put this one space to the left.. oops...

It's not going to affect the outcome much.....];W[ol];B[om]
;W[nl];B[nm];W[mm];B[mn];W[lm];B[ln];W[km]C[I realized at this point how foolish i was being. if this continued he would have a lot of teritory above his new wall. i did not want this to happen. however... i did not play it out well as you will see.

This is called a family feud, strengthening one side will weaken the other!!

Anyway, you've already almost killed the L8 stone, saving it is pointless....the center is not white by any means, you have ins at K13 and on the left....and the way you chose wrecked your lower right territory]

TR[kl][jm][jn][jo][jp][hq]C[At this point, you need to think about your K4 group!]

Some key points are, don't be inconsistent with your play!!  You were trying to save two groups at once in the middle of the game, that cost you a great deal of points.  

Don't start fighting too early in the game, there were some big opening points that were left untouched for a long time.  

The key to end game is to keep sente as long as you can!  Always think about that.

Keep playing!!];W[tt]C[You can check your score with the score command, type 'done' when finished.
