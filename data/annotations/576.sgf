GC[Comments by Arno Hollosi (dada), Austrian 2kyu.
Don't take my comments too seriously - I make at least as many mistakes as you :o)]

;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[ic]LB[jc:A][jd:B]C[dada: unusual :o)
More common is A (k17) or B (k16)];W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[pl]
LB[qk:A]C[dada: should be at A (r9)];B[qj]C[dada: good - might be a little bit too early though]
;W[qh];B[oj];W[oh];B[nl]LB[rl:A][nk:B]C[dada: this looks like an overplay.
I would play either A (s8) to gain a foothold and destroy W's eyes, or B (o9) which can't be cut of and protects the one space jump.]
;W[qe]
(;B[cj]TR[ic]C[dada: Bad!
You must play in the upper right corner. Otherwise white has an easy life and your marked stone becomes weak.
See variation.];W[qc]C[dada: good - painful for B];B[qd];W[pc]

(;B[od]LB[pe:A]C[dada: I think this move should be played at A (q15)]
;W[oc];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[pe];W[qf];B[ne]TR[cj]C[dada: the result of B playing the marked stone is very bad for black.
W has a big corner, secure life and B's stones are overconcentrated.]
;W[ok];B[nj];W[pj];B[pi];W[pk];B[oi];W[qi]TR[nl]C[dada: W gains again - due to the marked stone played earlier.]
;B[ph];W[hq];B[jq];W[io]C[dada: good];B[jo];W[in];B[jn];W[im]

(;B[jl]C[dada: this just helps W build his wall. Furthermore you're too close to your stones on the right. You don't make enough territory here. You have a potential moyo on the upper side. Don't help W destroying your potential.
See the variation for an alternative.];W[jm]C[dada: not urgent]
;B[km];W[il];B[jk];W[ik]LB[hj:A]C[dada: should be at A (h10)]
;B[jj];W[cg]C[dada: looks like the wrong side.
On the other hand W's lower left corner is still open - difficult to tell what to do.]
;B[cm];W[co];B[bn]C[dada: funny shape - I don't think that this is a good move]
;W[bo];B[cq]LB[ir:A]C[dada: Wow - suicidal
B shouldn't be able to live here. If there were a black stone at A (j2), then maybe you could use the corner aji to reduce the bottom area, but without support this invasion is doomed.]
;W[dq];B[bh];W[ch]LB[bg:A]C[dada: A (b13) looks better to me]
;B[ci];W[fc];B[ij]LB[hi:A]C[dada: should be at A (h11)];W[jp]
;B[kp];W[ip];B[pg];W[qg];B[ko]LB[kq:A][mn:B]C[dada: should be at A (l3)
There's nothing to be afraid of. The edge is much bigger than those 5 points around B (n6).]

(;W[jr]C[dada: I think W should cut - see varaition]
(;B[kr]LB[gd:A]C[dada: it might hurt, but I think the bottom edge is too small right now.
B should either invade the upper left corner or play A (g16) and build his moyo.
W will only gain about 10 points on the lower side - see variation.]
;W[hd]C[dada: good];B[id];W[he];B[if]C[dada: again - B's stones are too close - they are overconcentrated
Have a look at your stones to the right: they are thick and strong. And all you get for this thickness are lousy 15 points. W makes 5-10 points on his side while pushing into the center. So all in all you make only 5-10 points more than W.]
;W[ie];B[je];W[hf];B[ig];W[hg]
(;B[ih]C[dada: B is already behind. It isn't good enough to defend your territory. This move is too small.
You should try to invade the upper left corner. It looks like you can either live in the corner or connect to your group on the left.
[see center variation - in case B doesn't defend here\]];W[bg]
;B[ah]LB[bi:A][ai:B]C[dada: very bad shape. A (b11) or even B (a11) is much better.]
;W[ag]C[dada: that's why];B[bj];W[hb];B[ib]C[dada: this is too slow. You won't make much territory here. The territory is still open at the right.]
;W[cc]C[dada: I think this is an unnecessary move as B can't live in the corner anymore. But W is ahead and can play safe moves.]
;B[hj]LB[em:A]C[dada: What is the aim of this move?
If you want to reduce W's territory then A (e7) is the move.]
;W[hk]C[dada: bad - should be played around the e6 area.];B[fj]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[ei];B[fi];W[eh];B[fh];W[fg]
(;B[el]C[dada: again too slow. Should be at A (e6) - W can't cut (see variation)]
;W[en]C[dada: good];B[em];W[fn];B[gk]C[dada: not urgent - there are much bigger points on the board]
;W[rq]C[dada: like this one];B[qo]LB[rr:A][pn:B]C[dada: no good - should be either at A (s2) or B (q6)]
;W[ro];B[qr];W[po];B[oo];W[pn];B[qp];W[nk];B[mk];W[on];B[nn]
;W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[iq]LB[ir:A]C[dada: playing at A (j2) looks better]
;B[kq];W[hc];B[ir];W[hr];B[js];W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[gm]LB[hs:A]
[ha:B][rr:C]C[dada: too small - bigger moves are A (h1), B (h19) or C (s2)]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[cn];B[bm];W[dm];B[dl];W[dn];B[gn];W[go];B[la]
LB[hs:A][ha:B]C[dada: gote - better to play sente moves like A (h1) or B (h19)]
;W[rr];B[om];W[qs];B[pr]LB[ps:A]C[dada: ???
why not at A (q1)?];W[ps];B[os];W[rs];B[nr];W[gh];B[hh];W[gi]

;W[er];B[ds];W[br];B[fr];W[fq]C[dada: should be at A (h1). B might capture the marked stone, but he'll never get two eyes.]
;B[es]
(;W[eq]C[dada: same mistake again - see variation];B[hs]C[dada: B gets very lucky]
;W[gr];B[gs]
(;W[fs]C[dada: W doesn't need to win this ko. See variation.]
;B[rc];W[rb];B[fr];W[cl];B[bl];W[fs];B[re];W[is]C[dada: BOW!
The upper corner is much much MUCH bigger than this ko!];B[sd]

(;W[rf]LB[sb:A]C[dada: W has to play at A (t18) to make the corner alive.]
;B[sb];W[pb];B[ra];W[qb]LB[qa:A]C[dada: W has to play at A (r19) and get a ko. W will die anyway, but maybe the ko threat is big enough to win the game.]

(;B[sl]LB[rj:A]C[dada: no use - the best attempt would be A (s10) - but W has one liberty too many (see variation)]
;W[rj];B[nm];W[dk];B[ir];W[hs];B[jr];W[se]C[dada: B wins. But only due to a series of serious mistakes from W.

The first big mistake was not playing in the upper left corner (B #17). This was a crucial moment - keep your opponent small and vulnerable  and make territory while defending. Move #21 was in the wrong direction too - don't get confused by local fights - try to have a look at the whole board.

Looking back I think B #45 was the game losing move. B was very thick at the right - try to use this potential. Building a moyo is an investment into the future - don't go for instant cash, which is usually much less. When building walls, keep in mind that you use them as efficient as possible - try to count how much points you get and how much points your opponent gets. Counting and reading are the key skills to progress. A rough guide to positional judgement:

- count secure territory
- identify potential development areas? (i.e. where can territories be expanded?)
- where are weak and strong groups? (use the weak groups as leverage to expand your territory - going for a kill usually ends in disaster if you can't kill the group.)

If like at move #71 there is a potential area which is crucial for both sides, than go for it!
Don't care about  peanuts go for the big bucks!

In the endgame play sente moves rather than gote moves. Don't miss moves like h19 - they are yours. W has to defend.]

(;B[lq];W[kr];B[lr];W[jr]TR[kp][ko][jo][jn]C[dada: this is about the best B can do. Note that (as far as I've read out) all other variations lead to disaster. A crucial role in the other variations is, that W eventually gives atari to the marked group and gets urgently needed additional liberties. Which again shows, how bad blacks move at l5 moves]
