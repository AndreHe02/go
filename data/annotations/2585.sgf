Comments marked "al:"

al: By no means being a master, I have still spotted a few situations where my commentary might be of help.]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[dp];W[pq];B[jd];W[pj];B[jq];W[gp]C[al:];B[gq]
;W[gm];B[cj];W[ej];B[di];W[dj];B[ci]C[myndreach: I'm not sure about my opening...I feel weak in this area especially.

al: So far, the game gives the impression of fairly strong players; almost all stones are far away from the sides (higher than the third line),  the stones are far apart etc. Playing like this, you need to be strong to take advantage of the influence created, something beginners are not quite up to. One advice, which I myself tries to stick to, is to start by building some safe areas along the borders before ventureing deeper into the board like this.]
;W[md];B[ld];W[lc];B[kc];W[le];B[kd];W[mq];B[lq];W[lr];B[kr]
;W[mr];B[lp];W[mp];B[lo];W[mm]C[al: This seems a little bold; O6 had been more natural, but maybe white was trying to connect to the stones at left. Keep in mind that the territory along the left side is still open for invasion by black.]
;B[mo];W[no];B[pl]C[myndreach:this attack really messed me up badly....i wasn't sure at all how to deal with it.]
;W[pn]C[al: if N7 had been at O6, white would have been able to strengthen the Q10 stone and still have the opportunity to squash black's group, had black played Q5, for instance.]
;B[om];W[pm];B[ol];W[ql];B[on];W[nn]C[al: I think that white would have been better off at P5 - it is more important to secure a big corner than to save the N7 stone, which is still not in so great danger. Again, had N7 been at O6, the situation had been better fro white. Even so, black's gruop is weak at this point. It is almost surrounded by white stones, has no access to the side of the board, and is far away from other black groups.]
;B[oo]
(;W[op]C[myndreach: i guess q5 would have been much better....p4 was in order to keep my stones together, but i think if q5 first, i still would have connected, but kept his from invading also.

al: with Q5, black would have been stopped from intruding, and white could have sealed him in. See variation, which is pretty sluggish, but illuminates point.]
;B[po];W[qn]C[al: This is a shape to be avoided - the open triangle, which white should learn to be aware. It happens later in the game, too. I think it would have been better to play R7, let black get one eye at the side, but keep him from getting another one by sealing the exit to the left.]
;B[qo];W[rp]C[al: S6 would have avoided the triangle syndrome.]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[ro];W[rq];B[rn];W[qm];B[qk]C[myndreach: and my r7 stones are dead basically now

al: byt white still has the lower corner, and a stone at R10 would prevent the black gruop from penetrating further up the side.]
;W[gd]C[al: C17 or F17 would be a better attack against the top left corner, but maybe that is not what white intends here.]
;B[gc];W[gf];B[ef];W[fh];B[fg];W[gg];B[eh];W[ff];B[eg];W[gi]
;B[qj];W[qi];B[ri];W[qh];B[rh];W[rg]C[myndreach: were the last few moves the proper way to keep him from coming further up the right side?]
;B[oj];W[rj]C[myndreach:this looked like a spot where i could cut him successfully, but it doesn't work out that way at all]
;B[rk];W[sh];B[sj];W[pi];B[pk];W[nk];B[ok]C[myndreach: his stone chain continues to grow and grow and it seems i'm helpless to stop it

al: To stop this kind of growing, it is better to build a fence at some distance to it. Contact play is for surviving in a tight spot, not for building territory. It is a negotiation; you give some to gain some instead of losing most of it by acting greedy.

al: This is not so bad after all - a stone at R14 would secure a good chunk of territory.]
;W[ni]C[al: If O11 had been at O12, black would never get pass. Now, black can push through.]
;B[oi]C[al: But watch out for that open tringle shape of the R12 group..]
;W[oh];B[nj];W[lj];B[nh];W[ng]C[myndreach: i thought containment with o13 was worth letting the stones on o11 go.]
;B[mh];W[mg];B[og]C[al: The triangle syndrome prevents white from playing Q12 here.]
;W[qg];B[mi];W[of]C[al: Better for white to play Q12.];B[ph]

(;W[ll]C[myndreach: here i was sure i could escape.....but nope.]
;B[kl]C[myndreach: any way to save the n8 stones?

al: No, they were doomed when black played M9, but while they are still on the board, they can be used for building a wall to create some territory for white in the center. Back up to see variation.]
;W[jk];B[li];W[kj];B[ki];W[ji];B[jh];W[ii];B[ih];W[cl]C[myndreach: i felt as if i were being pushed around the whole game so far, so figured now was the time to try and take sente and push back a bit

al: The advice is "stay away from thickness", which implies that white should rather play closer to the black D4 stone, than close to the black wall, as now. White could even invade the lower left corner, which is still open.]
;B[bl];W[bm];B[bk];W[ck];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm];W[bo];B[co];W[bp]
;B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[br];B[ao];W[am];B[bj];W[cp]C[myndreach: of course b1 is vital to live here, but i skip it and he gets to it later on before i do and these all die :(

al: White A4 would do as well to live. However, white's opportunity to cut here can be an alternative.]
;B[do]
(;W[en]C[al: White should cut at D3 instead. Black has to give away the C3 group, or lose the C5 group. See variations.]

;B[fn];W[fo];B[gn];W[hm]C[myndreach: again his stones run amok within my territory....how to prevent this?

al: Put the fence a little bit away from black - give up some territory to secure the rest. Try playing E5 at E7 instead, earlier.]

;W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf]
(;W[cf]C[al: Maybe better to play C14 at D15. See variation.]
;B[de];W[bg];B[bb];W[bc]C[myndreach: is this correct now? i was pretty confused here]

;B[cg];W[fe];B[ee];W[fc];B[fb];W[gb];B[ec];W[eb]C[myndreach: blunder move....obviously f16 was needed

al: H17 would be better than F16, otherwise the white group has a hard time living.]

C[al: Safe kill. Myndreach, although I don't know your rating, you have some experience. I feel that most of white's losses in this game was due to not connecting solidly enough. To shy away a bit instead of confronting head on helps in that respect. Good luck in the future!
