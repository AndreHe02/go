C[Dear Reviewer,

I wish to thank you very much for taking the time to look at this game, and maybe to help me reduce some mistakes I do.
( I'm sorry for my bad english... I hope you'll understand my questions :) )

I'm Mishuu, 10k on KGS, and I played this game against Bunshichi 6k without any handicap. I was white, and finally lost by 11.5 pts. I think that Black was leading during all the game.

XCMeijin: Hi, I'm XCMeijin on KGS. I'm sure we can find points to help improve your game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ic];W[dg];B[fc];W[dj]C[I've seen this sequence in a pro-game, I thought this was good against Chinese Opening.

XCM: It's good to experiment with what you've seen. However, you SHOULD think about WHT the pros played this way, rather than blindly copying. 

In this case, both sides have an even result. White's stones are still on the 4th line, and spread out reasonably. Black's stones are focused on one side, for now, but it is now black's turn to play.]
;B[dn]
(;W[cm]C[XCM: I'm not sure you should make base with the D10-D13 stones. Because they're on the 4th line, it would be much easier to run out into the centre. In those terms, you could say C7 is not very useful.

As you're still on the 4th line, i would suggest that you come out at F4, to complement all your stones. (See variation)

If you wish to play joseki, attaching underneath at C6 is not bad for you. (See variation)]

C[Normally I'd play F4, but I'm a player who prefers influence.]
;B[eo];W[fp];B[eq];W[ep];B[dm];W[ck];B[dr];W[fr]C[A missclick...

XCM: The result is horrible for you anyway in the corner. Se variations a couple of moves back.]
;B[er];W[jq];B[mq];W[lp];B[np];W[oo];B[no];W[mn]C[Is this move good ? I wonder if defend the corner is better.

XCM: Defending the corner is certainly BIG. White will not die do easily on the bottom, so don't worry so much about it.]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[pr];W[qo];B[qr]
(;W[on]C[I know that S3 is normal and big for yose, but I wanted to take sente.

XCM: You have the right idea. Leave the yose for the yose stage of the game.

That said, i believe playing directly at O6 would be better to block black. (See variation)]
;B[rq];W[rp];B[hq];W[hp];B[iq];W[ip];B[jr];W[kq];B[kr]
(;W[ph]C[XCM: This is trying to accomplish too many things at once. Either grab the territory, or attack the corner. Trying to do both at the same time is weak. (See variation)]
;B[pj];W[oi];B[qm];W[pl];B[ql];W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[rk];W[oj]
;B[qh];W[qi];B[ri];W[pi];B[rj];W[fl]C[Now I was happy. I've made a quite large moyo, but I knew that Black'll invade it.

XCM: the moyo may be good, but in future try not to rely too much on it. you are letting black get away with too much. He has invaded you in places where you should not have let him.

That said, F8 is the ideal move for prevventing black from coming out in that area. Now you have to be wary of black coming down from the top.]
;B[ji]
(;W[jk]C[Don't know how to answer...

XCM: This is letting black get away with too much again! You have the advantage in this area, so be aggressive! (See variations)]

(;W[nc]C[Knowing that Black is ahead, I wanted to invade.

XCM: Perhaps invading at 3-3 would benefit you more. Later, you can counter black's thickness by invading around N14 (see variation)]

;B[if]C[Now Black leads by about 30 points. I tried to play actively.

XCM: Are you actually counting or have you been using Score Estimator? :D However, to be able to truly count is an important skill, so i suggest you develop that further, rather than using SE.

You are quite far behind at this stage, i am not sure what else you can do. But we shall see.]

Thank you very much for reviewing my game :)

Overall it was not that bad of a game. You have demonstrated that you can find weaknesses in your opponent's structures. You have to learn how to use your moyo more efficiently. Playing so defensively, as in this game, is a losing strategy.]
