;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq]C[First of all, is this opening proper in terms of the direction of my stones? Does it make more sense to play Q3  and R5 with Q16 in place?

Dr: the shimari points toward Q16 so is right direction];W[pg]
LB[pj:A]C[Dr: I like A as a pincer and excellent extension.  Being high it is hard to attack also]

(;B[qi]C[I felt that it was reasonable to pincer here, but the following sequence doesn't seem to make the best use of R11.]
;W[pk];B[qk]C[I wonder whether black should jump to P11 rather than play the small moves at R9 and S9.

Dr: I would certainly jump and split here]
(;W[ql];B[rk];W[rl]LB[nj:E][oj:C][pj:A][mk:F][nk:D][ok:B]C[Dr: pushing in contact with A... makes a leaning attack]

(;B[oi];W[pj];B[pi];W[qj];B[rj];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qg];W[ro]
;B[rp];W[pp];B[pq];W[nd]LB[md:B][ne:A][nf:C]C[Dr:  attaching at A may be an effecttive attack.  This separates the two stones and threatens to surround Q13 without touching it.]

(;B[og]C[Is this a useful play at P13? I suspect that something like P15 would have put more pressure on the white stone at Q13....The fight here seems like it could have went in many different ways, so I could use some help with being more aware about the direction in which I should have tried to guide the fight.

Dr: No.  It strengthens the weak stone and leaves another black stone with not very many liberties.]
;W[pe];B[qe]
(;W[qf];B[oe];W[pf]
(;B[re];W[rg];B[qh]C[Looking back now, R12 isn't necessary. I probably should have played P14; it doesn't look like white could get two eyes if black gets to connect at S11
Dr: P14 may work];W[rh];B[ri];W[rf]
(;B[of]C[At this point I don't know if I could avoid being cut at R16...

Dr:  Doesnt look like it.  See the thread];W[qd]C[Though it might have been better to atari back at R17 instead of fighting a losing capture race]

(;B[rd];W[qc];B[rc];W[rb];B[pc];W[qb];B[pb];W[sc];B[od];W[se]
C[Was it overkill for white to play T15?

Dr:  Yes.];B[fq]LB[fc:A][hc:C][cf:B]C[Dr:  How about A or B instead.  A is backed up by your wall.  B hopes to induce something around A allowing black to play around C, again using the thickness.]
;W[ip];B[cr]LB[cn:B][dn:C][fo:D][cq:A]C[Dr:  These are usual continuations for black here]
;W[dr]C[Extension was too wide, I see.

Dr:  black either jumps out , approaches from the other side, or takes the corner.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[fo]LB[co:A]C[Does white need this move or should it play something instead now?

Dr:  the move is reasonable.  stgart to capture the single stone on a large scale.  w should be looking at A also to protect against a cut]
;B[bm]CR[an][ao][ap][bp][ep][fp][aq][bq][eq][fq][gq][hq][ar]
[br][er][fr][gr][hr][as][fs][gs][hs]C[Just how bad was that exchange for black?

Dr:  Both played 5 stones.  w has more territory and a higher position altho the b territory is more secure]
;W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cs];B[bs];W[ds];B[br];W[lq];B[mr]
LB[fc:B][jd:C][cf:A][on:E][no:D][mp:F]C[Dr: Is this move urgent (needed for life)?  Is it big?  No.
If you are worried about the white structure along the bottom make one of the high moves (D-F) or work on your own structure at the top]
;W[lr];B[mq];W[gd]C[Dr:  Now the b wall is less useful];B[cj]
;W[ch];B[ej]LB[eh:A][mo:B]C[Dr:  These are better moves for w.  The two stones can be left for a while as not big]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[kc]C[This is looking very bad for black at the moment....

Dr:  yes.  way ahead];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf]
;W[bg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fh];B[gj]LB[hh:A][mo:B]C[Dr:  just A or B. The black wall is worth little so no need for w to jump ahead and complicate a won game]
;W[jh];B[hh];W[hi];B[gi];W[gh];B[md]LB[ii:A]C[Dr:  A is good enough for w]
;W[ld]C[Couldn't think of a better sente move....];B[mc];W[me]
;B[nc]LB[ii:A]C[Should have played O15 I think

Dr:  The ladder is good for b and you have a chance to reduce the enormous w moyos]

[gr:G][hr:F][jr:D][fs:I]C[Dr:  maybe w can play at A.  Black appears to have a chance with the actual line.  see the threads.  A may kill  I think]

;B[hl];W[ik];B[il];W[kk]C[So at this point I am just scrounging for sente moves and maybe ko threats, but that motive wasn't very conscious or deliberate.

;B[qm];W[on];B[np];W[qn];B[rm];W[pn];B[sl];W[pl];B[nk]C[This move would be huge later on, but is there any way for me to  realize how it would be important at this point?

Dr:  It separates two w groups, one of which lacks 2 eyes but has ample liberties]

LB[np:A]C[I'm not sure why I didn't just connect at L7. Then again, if I connect white might play something like O8 which might play out better for him.

Dr:  w is trying to lose an absolutely won game.  Secure the 2nd eye with A and be done]

;W[ml];B[nl];W[om];B[nj]C[Dr:   w just threw away 4-5 liberties without securing life]

C[White should just play at N14, no?];B[ne];W[ke];B[ib]C[This didn't turn into anything, but is it worth playing for the ko threat later?

Dr:  sure];W[ja];B[jc];W[ic];B[ka];W[jd];B[ga];W[eb];B[ps];W[ls]
;B[ec];W[ni];B[oj];W[eb];B[jo]C[With this variation I was just messing around to see if white could have lived.

Dr:  w is down to 6 liberties and a ko for 2nd eye.  Some of those liberties need to be filled to kill H4 group so b has a chance.  White can capture and avoid seki if he wins a ko.  see the added thread]

(;W[fa]C[Dr:  w missed the urgency];B[kp];W[da]C[So this ended up being big. White got greedy at the top left but lost the chance to make an eye at L4.]
;B[ca];W[ea];B[ko];W[kq];B[ad]C[Is this necessary?

Dr:  dont think so];W[ih];B[hi]C[I think this is too small to play in gote....]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[bi];B[bj];W[aj];B[ak];W[ai]
(;B[ag]C[Dr:  see the thread.  w needs an eye urgently since he is short of liberties]

(;W[af]C[Here is another fight which could have went either way maybe. Any guidance and clarity would be appreciated.

Dr:  if w kills the H4 group then ahead.  If it goes to seki, then its close]

;B[bc]C[Is this a useful move at this point?

Dr:  essential]
(;W[ag];B[dg];W[eg];B[df];W[de];B[np];W[ef]C[Is this move white's downfall?

Dr:  yes.  but see earlier threads];B[ol]C[At this point I see white's stones doesn't have many liberties, but I definitely predict the outcome of the fight. Is it the case that I need to fill at O3 right now? Had white realized what was going and restarted the ko fight, would it be able to stay alive? I think there is a variation which could end in seki if white wins the ko. Is it the case at there are no ko threats on the board that are worth responding to at this point?]
