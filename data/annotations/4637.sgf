C[I am white (labradors).  Looking for:

1) Analysis of opening 30 or so moves by both players,
2) What made the most important difference?
3) My weakest points (single moves or generally) and how to avoid them the next time
4) My strongest points (for reinforcement or augmentation).

Thanks!

Llywelyn: Violent game.  Some comments for both sides:

* Eschew contact plays.  When you attack stones, you want to "attack from a distance" and avoid touching them, since touching them usually only serves to make them stronger.

* Read before making a move.  If you don't read something as working, don't play it.  Leave it for later--you might see a way to save the stones or make use of them.  Don't just respond to your opponent--actively try to tenuki on every play.

*   If a stone isn't doing anything useful, don't be afraid to let it go.  In the end, the territory is often more valuable than the number of stones captured.

The game is about 24k KGS in level. It would benefit both players tremendously to play a lot more games.  

I have left comments throughout the game prefixed with "Llywelyn."  Let me know if you have any questions.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[cp]C[Llywelyn: I dislike this opening.  It makes the southern side of the board the hottest area, and gives black the first play there.]
;B[rn]TR[ep][fp][np][op][fq][nq]C[Llywelyn: Ew.  2nd line play, wrong direction, forces white to make an enclosure...  The marked moves are my preference on this board, but just about anything is better than S6.]
;W[oq];B[bn]C[Llywelyn: See what I said for Move #5.];W[eq]
;B[jp]C[Llywelyn: Good spot.];W[jc];B[fr]C[Llywelyn: Black has an obsession with 2nd line plays.  Avoid them in the opening.  Particularly if white already has a stone there on the third line.  This stone also has no relationship with any other black stone on the board.]
;W[er];B[eo]C[Llywelyn: Again, no relationship to any other stone on the board and not doing anything except making white stronger locally.]
;W[fc];B[db]TR[cf][df]C[Llywelyn: Passive and weak.  White can immediately play at C14 and force a response just to save the corner, giving white a great chance to attack B6 and E5.]

(;W[nc]TR[nd][cf]C[Llywelyn: White's position is low and fragile.]
;B[pb]TR[pf][qf]C[Llywelyn: Again.];W[qc]C[Llywelyn: Greedy.  All this does is give a few points of territory in the corner and build up thickness for the latter invasions at M17 and H17.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf]
(;B[rg]C[Llywelyn: Overplay.  The cut at R13 allows white to hane at both the head AND the tail of two stones.]
;W[qg]
(;B[qh]C[Llywelyn: "Atari is a vulger play."  this leaves a weakness that we will come back to in a moment.]
;W[pg];B[oe];W[of];B[nf];W[pe];B[nd];W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[ke]
C[Llywelyn: Building thickness going nowhere.  The west side is the largest side of the board, though at this point black has already lost.]
;W[le]LB[cf:A][ql:C][fq:B]C[Llywelyn: Overzealous unless white intends to cut at L14 after black blocks.  Better to tenuki.]
;B[lf];W[kd];B[je];W[ie]C[Llywelyn: Why the contact play?];B[if]
;W[he];B[gg];W[hf];B[ig];W[hg];B[hh];W[ih];B[jh];W[ii];B[ji]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[kg];B[lg];W[kh];B[ki]
(;W[jd]C[Llywelyn: Why should white force herself into a working ladder?  The ladder is already broken by the presence of the extra liberty at L14, playing at K16 forces black to fill that liberty and make this into a proper ladder.]
;B[kf];W[qn]C[Llywelyn: White has an obsession with contact plays.    There is no urgent reason to take advantage of the ladder at M12, since the entire area is of reduced value by Q13.]

[fp:B][lq:C]C[Llywelyn: it is debatable that these stones are doing anything useful.  Better to tenuki.]
;B[hj];W[ik];B[jl];W[jm]
(;B[lm]C[Llywelyn: Black is entirely too generous.  As Kageyama says: Don't pee where you can cut!]
;W[jk];B[lh];W[ni];B[il];W[hk]C[Llywelyn: Every stone is not sacred.  These stones are not currently doing anything useful and are just ten points that it will take 3 moves to effectively save.  

Better to tenuki.  The west side looks very valuable to me, as does a play such as F4 that splits black.]
;B[ll];W[km]C[Llywelyn: These stones still all need an extra move to save them, while making sure O11 remains alive should be a huge priority right now.]
;B[pi];W[nm];B[mn]
(;W[no]TR[mn][nn]SQ[nm]C[Llywelyn: "Even a moron connects against a peep."  Here white is giving black a free peep.]
;B[nn];W[on];B[om];W[ln];B[nl];W[mo];B[mm];W[pk]C[Llywelyn: White lacks eyespace or liberties to really do anything here.  Better to play elsewhere.]

;B[hl];W[gk];B[fi]C[Llywelyn: Not strictly necessary.];W[hm]
;B[gl];W[ek];B[fj];W[fk];B[dk]C[Llywelyn: I am not clear on what  this move is supposed to accomplish.  It is a contact play on a weak group, so it is making white stronger, it is too close to effectively contain white, and it doesn't build in a particularly valuable direction.

White can currently hook black into a net at any point by playing F7, and so a move around F7 is urgent for black to get out, since G8 is doing something very important right now.]
;W[el];B[gm];W[hn];B[gn]C[Llywelyn: contact plays like this make white stronger.  F6 works just as well without making wh ite strong against K5.]

;W[ej]C[Llywelyn: White has nowhere to go.  Black can ignore this and play the connection at F7.]

;W[kq];B[lp]
(;W[kr];B[lr];W[jq]C[Llywelyn: Bad shape, doesn't accomplish anything useful.  J3 is the right idea, but often it is better to simply tenuki if there isn't a good way out.  E4  is very big, and capturing G7 is sente with a good followup.]
