AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hi, This was a game between myself (Black) and a member of our 
local Go club. This has been my best game against this opponent 
so far, although thats not saying much since i still lost! (White 
wins by 22)

White has:
80 surrounded points
21 prisoners
101 points total

Black has:
63 surrounded points
16 prisoners
79 points total

Reviewer : Hi Ben,
 my name is jean-michel, I'm 14k on KGS.
Here is my analyse of your play in this game :
- you did not dare to attack your opponent ;
- you were afraid of playing at the contact of your opponent's stones ;
- you connected your stones too loosely ;
with the following consequences : 
- you defended too much letting your opponent do/try whatever he/she like with confidence; 
- you defended too lightly which is not efficient ;
- you did not punish/take advantage of your opponent mistakes ;
Do not worry ! ;-) This is normal. But this is what you have to fight against. This is mainly a problem of confidence and of reading, which are both linked since confidence is backed up by reading. But they can both be improved !
My advises :
- try to improve your reading ability by doing exercises, and by taking some minutes during the game before a move ;
- connect your stones more tightly (one less space for instance) so that you will get sronger units ;
- don't be afraid of attacking your opponent stones (but read ahead !) and keep your opponent stones as much isolated as possible.
Now let's get into it !];W[fq];B[hq];W[fo];B[pg]C[This was a careless mistake on my part, causing the lower left 
corner to become quite weak. Although thankfully i was able to 
rescue it later.

R: that's right ! Two white stones against one black stone : you *must* reinforce the corner.
The purpose of the pincer move is to attack white's stone by removing its base of life. So if you let white make life too easily (by attacking the corner), then you completely lose the purpose of your initial move. You must keep the pressure by playing D6 or there is no reason for you to play H3.
Also, Q13 is better at Q14. The connection is stronger so you can better resist later (see move #102). 
I think however that O16/O17 are more worthy.];W[dn];B[cq]TR[dj]
[hq]C[R: You decided to defend the corner, but you could also have let it like this and return to it later during the game, because any move you play now only makes white stronger compared to the two marked stones.
There is however one rule you need to follow : when you want to make life, the first thing you need to do is EXTEND your eye space. 
Playing C5 first (threatening to escape) and then C3.];W[dr]
LB[cr:A]SQ[aq][bq][ar][br][as][bs]C[R:...I think the corner is not yet captured but another white move would 
definitively kill the corner.
The best answer (after C5) is A protecting your vital space (marked with 
squares) and threatening to capture D2.
As you can see, white is strengthened (4 stones against two on the left, and a single stone on the right)]
;B[lp]C[R: Good intention...];W[fc];B[df]C[I played here because I didn't want my stone at D10 to become 
trapped with two white stones above and below. But this allowed 
White to form a base on the upper part of the board which later 
cost me the game. Would the standard move at H17 been better 
here?

R:
 Good choice.
  You should not risk white C14 since it makes the situation more complex and dangerous, which is usually to the advantage of the stronger player.
However, you should know that D14 is also a STANDARD answer to 
white's approach stone. You accept that white 
makes some territory by extending from his stone, in exchange 
you get left side territory for yourself AND safety (a simpler situation).
The simpler for you, the harder for your opponent to take away 
your territory.
Besides, you keep the initiative since white needs now to make 
a base for his stone.
It is a peaceful way of playing.];W[ic]C[R: This is a fair result.]
;B[lc]TR[lp]CR[mc][nc][np][mq][nq]C[R: The two marked stones you have played were good intentions, but they would be better at one of the circled points instead.
The reason is that the 4-4 stone alone does not defend a corner. You have to help it with surounding stones, and the closer, the stronger they are, and the more difficult for your opponent to invade there. Later, white will invade at R17 because he has enough room to live in the corner.
The M17 stone is too far from Q16 stone for the above reason, but it is also too close from white's two stones, which are strong because tightly connected, therefore weakening the M17 stone. So you have two weak goups (M17-Q16) instead of a strong one.
The M4 stone plays no role in helping either the Q4 stone, or the H3 stone, because it is too far from any of them.
If you want to help the H3 stone, you must play K3 or L3, and if you want to help the hoshi stone, then play at one of the circled points. By playing in the middle, you may well end up having to save two groups instead of rescuing one.
The same is true for the Q13 stone, as mentionned earlier, which is not really efficient at helping neither Q16 nor Q10.
So all in all, one can see that you are trying to connect your stones together, but the connections you try to establish are too loose (that means white can easily break throught them). It is bettter to have strong groups which can rescue weak ones than too have weak groups which try to defend themselves.]
;W[qn]C[R: White invades at R6.
If you look at the board before this move, you can see that this 
was an empty area. As it was not black's territory there, you 
should therefore not worry. 
But you can certainly see that it is at the boundary between 
two black spheres of influence, one on the lower side and one 
on the upper right side. 
Besides, this attack clearly shows that these two areas are opened 
to white. If you block from the upper side, white will dive into 
the corner, and if you block from the lower side, white will 
jump inside your upper sphere. Since you cannot play two stones 
in a row, this is something you must accept. You have however 
the CHOICE from which side to play, hence, you should look at 
this invasion as an opportunity for black to secure one of his 
two areas.
Now how ?
We will look at three variations.]
(;B[pm]C[Whites attack behind my line here (R6) caused me trouble later, 
and cost me a lot of points. How should I have defended in this 
situation?

R:
 Any move is good as long as it is on the third line.
Playing on the fourth line here let white develop his stone on 
the third line, taking away the side from you.];W[ql];B[cm]
;W[cn];B[dl];W[jq]C[R: This is too deep, K4 would have separated the two black stones.]
;B[jp];W[hr];B[iq];W[ir]
(;B[jr]C[R: This atari is not good. After white extends to L3, this stone 
is captured.
 You 'd better atari from L3 and close the side.
Pease, see variation.];W[kq];B[lq];W[kr];B[lr];W[ip]TR[lp][hq]
C[R: As you can see, your two stones were cut.];B[kp];W[js]
;B[io];W[hp]TR[ql][qn]C[R:
 Now that the fight is over, and you have the initiative, look 
at the position you have obtained througt the fight.
The lower right corner has its left side closed with a big black 
wall, but what about his right side ?
Doesn't the two marked white stones threatens to invade there 
? What would you do if white played at R3 ?];B[jm]C[R: This is a good move, but I advise to play R4 instead, enclosing your territory 
and threatening the two white stones.
An invasion at R3 is a big weakness !];W[cc];B[cd]C[R: Good ! You decided to block on the right side.]
;W[dc];B[mm]C[R:
 This move is too small, it looks as if this is gonna be the CENTER 
of your territory. No need to play inside. You should play at 
the BORDER of your territory. What about K10 or N10 instead ? (not forgetting R4...) If you are afraid of the two white stones on the right, then you can also play Q6.]
;W[fl];B[fj]C[R: good. Here your play is very strong.];W[hl]
;B[jj]LB[dd:F][pd:A][df:G][pg:B][dj:H][fj:I][pj:C][dl:J][pm:D]
[pp:E]C[R: Look at the A-E stones and at the F-J stones.
I think the F-J stones are more efficient at securing territorry 
than the A-E stones, because they are stronger together, that 
is less vulnerable,
 whereas the A-E stones can be parted to easily from each other.
 If you look at the result at the end of the game, you lost the whole right side, while you made territory on the left side.]
;W[hj]
(;B[hh]LB[ff:B][jh:A]C[R:
 This is a useless move.
 You are trying to separate two living groups, which is futile. 
Ask yourself where is your potential teritorry.
You'd rather turn your sphere of influence into territory by 
delimiting BORDERS, around A or B for instance.
White can play anywhere he wants in this area (GHJ lines), he's 
not going to make any points with it. You'd better secure your own points.
I see two areas that can be turned into territory, defined by 
squares and triangles. Please see variation.];W[gi];B[fh]LB[fi:A]
C[R:
 You should play stronger moves, don't be afraid of contact plays.
A is stronger.
Forget about the H12 stone, concentrate on your borders.
You don't need to save all you stones, this is impossible and 
can lead you to crumble.];W[ff];B[eg];W[gh];B[gg]LB[fg:A]C[R: Better play at A. there's no need to cut white, and you can sacrifice a single stone, can't you ?]
;W[fg];B[hg]TR[gg][hh]C[R:
 There was no need to cut white's stones, since his two groups 
were already alive.
Now you have three heavy stones that are loosely connected to living stones, and thus a nice target fo white.]
;W[ii]C[R: White is cutting through your stones.]
(;B[jh]LB[ji:A]C[R:
 Again this is too loose.
 Don't be afraid of contact, white is helping you to build a nice wall.
You should play at A, and forget about the three stones.
Look at the potential territory you can make on the right side ! It is already 
huge ! Don't put it at stake playing too light moves.
When your opponent plays close to your wall, this is an OPPORTUNITY to strengthen your own stones !
See variation];W[ji]
(;B[lh]CR[kh][ki][kj]C[R: Again, this is too light. You are building highways for white inside your moyo. The time is now for contact plays.
See variations];W[kj];B[jk]C[R:
 Remember, you can't save every stone.
 
By saving this stone, you allow white to devastate your right 
side teritory. You should sacrifice such stones to build your territory.]
;W[ki];B[mj]C[R: at last ! you decided to contain this invasion. N10 has a very good relationship with M12 (keima)]
;W[ek];B[dk];W[ej];B[ei];W[fi];B[eh]LB[fh:A][fj:B]C[R: Because A was too loose, you lost the B stone.]
;W[ih];B[ig]C[R: you should read before you play : K13 atari followed by K14 captures the three stones. No need to add a fourth one to that captured group. I advise K13 instead.]
;W[jg];B[kh];W[jf];B[fe]TR[hh][jh][lh]C[In my attempt to connect the left side with the stones at H13 
I ended up killing them and only gave white the upper side of 
the board, how should I have approached this?

R: You played too lightly (two one space jumped in a row as highlighted by the triangles) which allowed white to cut through your stones.
You should have sacrificed them by playing K13 instead of J13. 
But you could have sacrified them as early as white's J11 move (cutting through your stones). If you hadn't in mind to save them, you would not have played K12, but probably K11, and you would not have let white into your territory.
If you really wanted to save them, then you should have played M12 at K13. M12 at K13 makes a bamboo joint, which is a very tight connection. But even if you played that connection you woud still need to have them escape towards the uper-right corner.]
;W[gf];B[le];W[ge];B[ee]C[R: too defensive ! F16 !];W[qp];B[qq]
;W[po];B[oo]LB[op:A][pq:B][qr:C]C[R:
 Must be at A, otherwise white can atari at B after which he plays C taking the whole corner.
Again you should read before you play. These are critical moments which induce the rest of the sequence. By playing P5, you leave a weakness at B.]
;W[pq];B[op]C[This attack by white didn't go well for me, although it was recovered 
a little by whites mistake later on. Losing my key stones seems 
to be my greatest mistake!


R: This is because you didn' t think about the weaknesses you may leave behind. Don't worry, but keep focused.
But this white attack was looming ever since he played R6. You didn't answer properly at that time, leaving this opportunity for him.]
;W[qr];B[pn];W[qo];B[rq];W[rr];B[pr]LB[oq:A]C[R: Atari from the wrong side. This must be at A]
;W[oq];B[or];W[rp]LB[nq:A]C[R:
 A mistake from white. He should play first at A increasing his liberties and then capture at S4.]
;B[nq];W[sq];B[pq];W[qc]LB[lc:A][pg:B]C[R: You are being invaded because your corner is not strong enougth (A and B are too far). This is to be expected because you didn't care to protect it.
You have to know that a 4-4 stone alone is always susceptible to 3-3 invasion. It 
is nothing disastrous however unless all your surrouding stones depend on the corner to live. If you have a lonely 4-4 stone, you must expect an invasion at 
some time during the game. To prevent such invasion, you need 
to add a stone at R16.
This can be wise in certain situations as explained above.
Now how to cope with this ?
The first thing to realize is that without the help of surrounding 
stones, you cannot kill white.
So you just need to protect the most interesting side for you.
Please, see varition.]
(;B[kk];W[pc];B[qd];W[rd]C[Again i've been attacked in a corner i thought was safe for the 
time being. Costing me a lot in this case. How should i defend 
my corners after 3x3 attacks like this one?];B[re]LB[oc:A][od:B]
C[R: You need to block the upper side.
The right side is already without any prospects, because of the low position of the R8 stone..

;W[nh];B[oi];W[me];B[md]C[This move was an attempt to keep the upper group at M17 alive, 
but perhaps it would have been better to connect first at N14?


R:
 There are two ways for this group to live : connect to  O15 stones, 
or make two eyes on the upper side.
If you are confident you can make two eyes on the upper side, 
then go for it ! as this reduces white territory.
If you don't see a way to live, then you must connect by playing 
N14.

 It is easier for a group of stone to get life in the corner. 
So denying the access to the corner is usually a good idea. The 
counterpart is that white will have to fight ferociously to live, 
which you should be prepared to.
1- White can make a base for his stone with A, and this should 
again be viewed as an opportunity for black to close his top 
area with B.
2- But white can also chose to attack the lower group. Your two 
stones Q4/R4 are very strong to protect the corner, but there's 
a weakness in black's shape at the bottom. Do you see it ?
Because the M4 stone is too far, white can attack 
at O3 or O4 and aim at separating the 4 bottom stones in two groups. 
 If you protect the corner, he may capture the two left stones, 
and if you protect these stones, he may capture the whole corner

 This is another way of dealing with R6.
