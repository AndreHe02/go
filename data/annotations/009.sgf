DT[1994-02-27]TM[1800]KM[0.500000];B[dd];W[pd]C[White is inviting black into a fighting game...

If black takes the diagonal corner, s/he splits the board on a large scale  and in theory has a slight advantage due to first move...    This is just a comment.  When I was at your level, I often played fighting  moves, thinking they were peaceful, and peaceful moves thinking they were  fighting moves.  It is important to be aware of your style.]
;B[dq]C[black declines the invitation.];W[qq];B[ck];W[fc];B[id];W[cc];B
[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[bc]C[b (variation) is the  bigger point to make use of black's moyo.  In these star-point pincer josekis  where black lets the invading stone connect to the approach stone, white gets  profit in sente.  Black *

Black is too hung up on the 10-20 pts of territory he loses by being open at  the edge.   His thickness is more important.  Depending on the followup, the area that is  open may not be black territory anyway  -- proverb:  "Don't use thickness to  surround territory."]
;B[bd]C[so white should play b (variation).   It is the key point for erasing black's influence on the side.  It will be  sente  also.

If black builds up his framework, white will neutralize his whole wall on the  next move...]

(;W[dj];B[dk];W[ej];B[bi];W[ek];B[dm];W[dh];B[fd]M[dh][dj][ej][ek]C[See what happened  here?
black gets the key point connecting his four stones to j16 making thickness.   You just gave him secure territory under the center star point and only have  a weak group in the center to show for it.

You will have a hard time invading at the bottom because it will hurt your  center group.

At this point I might play b (variation) and let black seal me in to give  the weak group a head start in the wriggling.]

(;W[ec];B[fg];W[gk];B[gc]C[Yikes!  a is  terrible shape.  b (variation) will be better -- giving more eyeshape, more  territory and will certainly be sente.

If black plays b in the future, white may have to respond to avoid a ko or  seki.  this will give black an endgame advantage.]

(;W[fb]M[dh][dj][ej][ek][gk]C[black a  is from the wrong side.  26 leaves black open at the edge - so this can't  amount to much territory without an extra move from black.  He should take up  position on the other side with b , c or d -- or do something on the bottom

The idea would be to build up a position on the side and use it to attack the  white center.

Whenever there is a weak group on the board, both players should make it the  focus of their play.]

(;B[nc];W[qf]L[pf][lc]M[nc]C[28 is too defensive.  The right side is your sphere of influence.  Play on  the fourth line to make bigger potential territory and to help out your  center group.

Note: g also puts more pressure on the marked black stone so he is more  likely to make the bad move at a next.  In the game he was free to tenuki  without serious repercussions.  If you play 'g' -- and invasion later at 'h'  will be severe.]
;B[pb]C[As mentioned this is not good.  other  areas are much more urgent for black.  particularly since you played the  submissive knight's move.]
;W[jp]C[You catch the big point.    Notice how this helps your center group, by taking away black potential  profit area.  If he does attack your center -- black will have fewer places  to profit]
;B[op];W[po];B[lq]C['a' is a formula  move to make black heavy, but

I like two points better

b (variation) and c (variation)]
(;W[kq];B[lp];W[oo];B[ln];W[jn];B[gm];W[hl];B[io]C[Note what has happened in the game.

White has only just connected.  None of your marked stones are making  territory or threatening black, or pointing influence in a useful direction.   they aren't even stealing territory black had a claim to.  Meanwhile black  has invaded your moyo and is sa

b is clearly the move to split white in two.  (some variations shown)

Now white has two weak groups and unless you fight skillfully the game would  be over soon.

Note how your weak center group comes back to haunt you now, if black plays  severely...

Fortunately for you he did not.]
(;B[hm];W[km];B[lm];W[kl];B[pq];W[qp];B[pr];W[ql]M[lm][qf]C[a is not  worth enough.

It doesn't press white low on the right side.  white can't do much more there  anyway because of the marked black stone and the low position of the marked  white stone.

b is much bigger.  it takes away white's easy eye space on the bottom and  probably turns into territory for black down the road.

white won't have time to build up the right side, anyway... (see  variation)]

(;B[nl];W[hq]L[qc][nj][pk]C[good point for white.

Black a is another mistake.  g is the key point locally.  If white plays a it  will be quickly erased by a black move around h or a shoulder hit at i.  Even  an invasion at b (variation) is possible.  The top side isn't that big with  the open edge so 'a'

Black should play g, i, or possibly b]
(;B[ne]L[pj][qc]C[After all those variations I hope you can see just how weak white's  framework is.    If you want to get much territory, you must defend it.  g or h are best.

What does 54 do that another move later wouldn't take care of?];W[hh];B
[eh]M[hq]C[55 seems forcing, but a right side move  is just as big as black's followup, plus you get sente.

b (variation)

Your center group is safe once you played the marked stone.  there is no need  to worry about it so much.  only a threat to cut off a big portion is severe.]

(;W[ch];B[ig]L[hb][lf]C[with a you are giving in to black.  How  much territory can you surround in the center???

You must keep him from getting too much on top by jumping in at g or making a  light invasion at h.  of course the right side points mentioned earlier are  still good.

mutual don't worry about white spoiling your few potential points in the  center.  mutual damage will favor white since black has much more potential  territory.]
;W[ih];B[jg];W[pi]L[qc]C[a is bad for  black.  since he got in 57 and 59 he should play 'b' making territory.  b is  gote but has good potential as both hane and connection will be sente against  the corner if white leav

Of course 'g' is also a huge point that has been left.

A does nothing for black. and white would gain no territory fro playing  there.  it is like playing dame -- yet there are *very* big points left on  the board.]

(;B[ni]L[hb][qc]C[g or h is bigger but a is a good engame point.   much more valuable than 61.

Note: it is probably sente as it threatens invasion of black's corner.]
;W[fq];B[gl]C[b is maybe better shape as it  reaches for the connection better.  this is minor  -- a is fine too.]

(;W[hk];B[qg]C[b (variation) is the key point for  connectivity.  don't let black play it.

If you take it, black struggles to live giving your groups power and taking  few points.

(see a variation later on how black can take advantage of your move 66...)]

(;W[qh];B[pg];W[rg];B[rh];W[rf];B[ri];W[qj]C[a is a mistake.  black should play b  (variation)]

(;B[ph];W[qi];B[jh];W[ji];B[ki];W[jj]L[gb][qc][hb][qb]C[black 'a' is not necessary.   Again he should go for bigger territory with g or h.  You should consider  stealing one of these points ( i or j) yourself instead of 76 or 78...   your connection should hold up anyway.]
;B[mj]C['a' is a good invasion.  this is what your move at f3 promised as followup when black failed to answer]
;W[dp];B[ep];W[eq];B[cq]C[b is the  important point.]
(;W[fn]M[gl][gm][hm][io]C[black niggles over his four stones.

'b' is the key point.]
(;B[fo];W[em];B[el];W[eo];B[do];W[fp];B[fm];W[cp];B[en];W[go]L[bq]C[this was a jumble of fighting that I  can't read accurately,  but you got a plum in 92 and then didn't capitalize when you played 94.  that  stone was worth nothing. You could have captured the corner with g instead.   the ponnuki isn't worth much since you have a very strong group right next to  it.  It should face o

Both sides seem too focused on unimportant stones in this fight.  The key  battle is for the corner territory.  Both sides have let chances slip to take  the initiative in that fight.]

I think b works best.
(see variation)]
(;W[qn]C[if black plays b (variation) he takes  advantage of your mistake at 08.  a lets you off the hook, though you still  do better to play as in the last diagram.]

(;B[rm];W[rl];B[pk];W[rj];B[om];W[pn];B[qb]C[a is profitable, but when the opponent doesn't have a strong hold on the  third line the jump at b is better (variation)

(note black misplayed the response to a in the game)]
(;W[ia];B[ib];W[ha]C[b is the correct response to save the most  territory. (variation)

c is only one point worse and safer.... (variation)]
(;B[gb];W[ga];B[kb];W[ka];B[la];W[ja];B[lc]C[the placement at b (variation) is vicious and much more  profitable than a]

congratulations....:-)

I hope my commentary has been helpful.
