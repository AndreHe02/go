;B[pd]C[Dear reviewer,

I played white in this game. At some time i try'd to live in blacks mojo and died. How to reduce instead of invade the mojo?

Please review for both sides.

Thankyou very much!

Hello Benni,

my name is Christian Reiling, I am German 1 dan and also
1 dan on kgs.

Although I could write this review in German, I will write it in English, in order to enable reading to more players.

I hope you will find my hints useful.

Yours

A bit too territory orientated for my taste.

I think B would be better, but what I would prefer here is A -

aiming at C afterwards.];B[eq];W[cq];B[eo];W[dn];B[dq];W[cr]
LB[cp:A]C[CR: 

Looks strange to me - I think this is already an overplay.

Therefore at A instead.

Now, Black's A means bad aji for White.];B[en];W[pr]LB[dm:A]
C[better at A to make territory at the 4th line?

CR: Yes!];B[dm];W[em]LB[cm:A]C[I think this cut was an overplay.

CR: Yes, at A instead.];B[dl];W[fm];B[gn];W[ek];B[dk];W[fj]
LB[gk:B][fk:A]TR[fm][em][ek][fj]C[Is A or B better shape?


CR: 

I think this is not the question here.

The question is, are the marked stones important or are they a burden?

"Pressing down" the three black stones on the 4th line is no good idea!]
;B[di];W[bn];B[bm];W[fc]LB[hl:B][il:A]C[maybe secure my center group first? at A? But than black played around f17 and this look large.

CR: I think A would be too far here, B would be OK.

But you move is also OK, I think.];B[el];W[fl];B[ej];W[fk];B[fi]
;W[il];B[in];W[gi];B[fh];W[cc];B[dc];W[dd]C[CR: Good move!]
;B[ed];W[de];B[ec];W[bd];B[ee];W[ce]C[i was happy with this corner development, because my corner is large and neutralises blacks potential territory.

CR: 
I agree with the last, but "large" 
I would call something bigger :) !

But I agree, that this exchange was good for White.];B[gh]LB[jc:A]
C[CR: Better around A!];W[hi];B[jc]C[CR: This is a big loss for White!

This is the move for Black to win this game.];W[of]LB[ke:B]
[je:A]C[mistake again? better reduce now at A or B?

CR: It's OK, I think - Black's moyo is still open!];B[mf]LB[kd:A]
TR[jc]C[CR: Definitely the point, where both moyos meet.

But look at the marked stone! Isn't it a bit to low?

What about White's A now?];W[hh]LB[kd:A]C[CR: I would play A here.]

(;W[lq]C[CR: Too deep, drives Black into your moyo.

Look at my variation.];B[lr];W[kr];B[kq];W[mr];B[lp];W[mq];B[mp]

(;W[nr]C[CR:  Look at my variation.];B[oq];W[pq]LB[jr:A]C[better at A?

CR: No, I think this move was necessary.];B[jr];W[ls]C[to small?]
;B[nm];W[pl];B[rd]C[CR: Big!];W[fb]C[now i tryed to live in blacks territory but it does not work. is there a way to live? Is there an effective  way for white to reduce blacks territory from the outside instead?

CR: 

As you already know - this is nonsense, of course!

There was still a chance to win this game - but now?

Black has no weakness here, so living is impossible.];B[db]
