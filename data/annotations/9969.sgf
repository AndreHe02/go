Daniel: Hello, thanks for submitting your game for review.  I'll prefix my comments in the sgf with "Daniel:" as here.  I see from the e-mail that your name is Daniel as well, so hopefully that won't be too confusing.  I'll leave general comments on the last move.]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[fq];W[cn];B[kq];W[nc];B[qf]C[Daniel: Pulling back high might mesh better with B's overall framework strategy.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[pj];W[dj]C[qianyilong: I thought things were fairly even here is that true?

Daniel: Yes, this looks like a fairly even result so far to me.]

(;B[cq]C[Daniel: This seems bad.  You're going to give W a wall facing your framework in exchange for a little bit of corner territory.  W's wall should be very effective in helping W invade.  Since B moves first, B should be able to force W into making the first invasion and build strength and territory.  By invading early you're somewhat negating the framework strategy played so far.]
;W[dq];B[dr]
(;W[cp];B[bq];W[bp];B[eq]C[Looking at it now this exchange got me very few points and gave him a wall facing his territory and my wall is very low and not enclosing much.

Daniel: Yeah.  This isn't a great result.  I think the main problem here is that your invasion wasn't consistent with your overall strategy.  Up until you played C3, you were playing a large framework vs framework game.  To suddenlyplay a small invasion is letting W build his framework naturally while B's is injured.]

Daniel: Yeah, this looks like a tesuji.  I think the timing is suspect though.  W can get out in two areas, so this won't kill, which means it's just points, which means it should be saved for endgame.]

Daniel: I count nearly 60 points for B and only a handful for W, but W has almost all the remaining potential.  W would need to make about 50 points on the left to with this game, which seems possible, but a tall order.  I like B right now.]

(;B[nd]C[qianyilong: I like ko fights. I may not be good at them but nothing makes a game as exciting as a serious ko fight going on.

Daniel: That's fine, but it may not be the best idea to pick a ko fight when you have a solid lead.  It probably makes more sense to jump into the left and start working to eliminate some of that potential.  Also, W has a weakness at Q14 to exploit which I think makes this ko fight unwinable for B.]

Daniel:  I count about 17 for B in the lower right, about 20 in the lower left, 9 in the upper left, and about 12 in the upper right.  That's 56 total on the board for B.  Plus 11 prisoners is 67.

I count about 32 for W along the right side, 12 along the top, and about 15 in the middle and right.  That's 59 on the board for W.  Plus prisoners and komi is 76.5.

So B is down by a lot and there isn't a lot of room to make it up, but it's a ddk game, so anything is possible.  I don't think it's resign time for B, but B will need excellent endgame.]

Happy Adams: mid game was very interesting

Daniel: Thanks for submitting the game.  I think your assessment of a lead that fell apart was right.  You had a lot of aji in the lower right and didn't defend well when W invaded.  A few general points:

- Play solid shapes.  Moves like R7 that can be cut are at best a liability for later and at worst allow you to be sliced to pieces.  You were generally fighting on uneven ground because you were cut too much.

- Play sente endgame.  You probably could have come back in the endgame, but you kept giving up sente by playing small gote moves.  Endgame is all about keeping sente.

Good luck with your go playing!])
