C[I think strategicaly I lost by invading the upper left too early without buildung up influence there, and by not invading the lower left early enough. I'd like to know if thats true and what major tactical mistakes I've made during the game. thanks.

Hi Markus, I presume you are playing Black from your  future comments.]

This seems like a bad move to me.

So far in other respects, the game seems to be proceeding well for both sides.]

This does not exploit white's error. See variation.];W[rl];B[ql]
;W[rm];B[jq]C[******************
This is playable, but the black wall is not too strong yet. My personal feeling is continuing at R9 is best, seeking to confine white to the corner. If White continues, 2nd line running  like this is bad.]
;W[lp];B[jo];W[ln];B[nm]C[Having to make this move is painful given the weak group at K3.]
;W[qk]C[White chooses an odd time to profit. The N3 group needs strengthening.]
;B[jm]C[A good play. Helps K3, weakens N3.];W[ll];B[nk]C[******

I don't think black can afford to cut the white group yet, but it is pretty weakly connected. Strengthing the K3 group would permit a cut.]
;W[kn];B[jn]C[****

This peep is good, prevents cutting. However black gains power.]
;W[lj];B[ni];W[jk];B[qi]C[****************

This is too risky. K2 is still weak. Play should be there. White will profit well in the attack.]
;W[go];B[gm];W[nc]C[The timing is a little odd here, as the pursuit of the K3 group is the main thing. However, this is a big move, and so no fault can be attached to it.]
;B[lc]C[************

This move works against the other black stones. White will run out, creating potential issues for the Q3 group, and possibly destroying the right hand side, which black has tentatively claimed.]
;W[pf]
(;B[oe]C[better O16?

*****
Honestly I am not good enough to say. My feeling is this pressures the right hand side more - i.e. You want the right side, and the top you are conceding to white. o16 would favor the top over the side.

But on the other hand, white could live with o16 in return for a black wall. See variation.]
;W[qc]C[********

White should really not give Black this choice. He should decide which stone is bigger and save that.]
;B[pc]C[R16 and seal W in?

***************

Yes. The right is bigger and works with previously played stones.  The area around O17 is small.]

;W[nf]C[****************

This was an interesting sequence, and I have no issue with the way it was played by both sides. Its really complex though, and I am sure one side or the other might have gained more advantage. White did come out ahead here, but that was expected since M17 was too ambitious.]
;B[me];W[ne]C[invade at C3 or cap at J15...?
or keep W's groups divided with something like M12?];B[gc]C[*******

The cap at J 15 would have been ok here. This invasion is an overplay in the light of the power of white's wall at o18]

;W[jb];B[jc];W[jd];B[kc];W[hb]C[*************

This is a terrible result for black, as predicted. White retains the top left,  and blacks M17 group is in trouble.]
;B[ie]C[************

This move has no purpose. White's group at J17 is not killable, and this saddles black with more weak groups to worry about.]
;W[id];B[ke];W[mg];B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[mi]C[*************

The black group at M17 is getting out of trouble, but the white groups have linked - a high price to pay.]

It is fairly clear to me that overly aggressive play is responsible for black's loss here. This is good, because it is something relatively easy to correct. Pay attention to weak groups - do not tenuki or attack elsewhere when you have weak groups next to strong groups. Generally speaking, invasion requires preparation - stones to escape to, or thickness to run to. Diving in, you might survive, but your opponent will gain elsewhere.

I hope these comments are helpful. You show good fighting skills here, but use them well, not to save groups that should be stronger!]

There are many possibilities from here. I think white will succeed, possibly killing something big. However, perhaps the more conservative way white played in the game is better, since this variation is riskier.]
