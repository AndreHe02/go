C[hello reviewer,

i was white in this game, black played for influence and i played territorially as usual.
any help with strategy, opening, value of moves , or anything else is appreciated.

i have made some comments

Neil Mclean

B: your opening was the weakest part of your game. your stones were not working well together. You played very well in the endgame! But it was impossible to turn the game around at that stage.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp];B[df];W[ch];B[ep];W[dn];B[dl]C[not sure what to play here]
;W[gq]C[not sure what to play here
B: This is the wrong direction.
Before your move white is  stronger then black on the left side.  you should try to keep your advantage there by playing first F6 (black might answer G3) and then at E12, to keep the two week black groups on the left side seperated. Maybe directly E12 is also possible. Your move G3 is just producing one more weak white group you have to look after. Your stones are not working together.]
;B[fo]C[B: Black correctly keeps your groups apart.];W[jq];B[fm]
C[B: black closes in your corner stones. This means: Your stones C4,D6 will play not much of a role in the fights to come. This is bad.]
;W[gd];B[gf]C[B: White has no longer the advantage on the left side. White has to struggle now.]
;W[cj];B[bl];W[dq];B[eq];W[bf];B[ce];W[cm]C[B: So far this is quite a bad result for you. White has four isolated groups. your best chance is the attackable string of black stones C15,D14,G14. It will be rather important what happens to them.]
;B[cl];W[eh]C[B: Good!];B[fg];W[cd]C[B: OK, you make the black stones heavy. But Black B15 will weaken your stone B14. This move is hard to judge.]
;B[be];W[ej]C[i wasnt sure about what to play, f10 better?
B: Right. F10 is better form.];B[fk];W[gi]C[B: Good!];B[if]
;W[id];B[ip];W[iq];B[gp]C[B: Black wastes a move here. He should imediately play K10. That fight in the middle is all important.]
;W[mq]C[B: again: Moving out in the middle (J11) is more imortant.]
;B[jp];W[kp];B[ko];W[lp];B[ii];W[hj];B[jk];W[cf]C[B: This move is indeed necessary. Unfortunately it weakens your stones on the upper side.]
;B[de];W[dg];B[af];W[bg];B[ec];W[fc]C[B: Good!];B[ed];W[eb]
;B[cb];W[db];B[bc];W[po]C[mybe o17 is better, or o16 since it cant be pincered
B: I think your Q5 is an excellent move! Q3 is attacked from two sides now. Blacks right side could become very big if you played O17.]
;B[kc];W[bd]C[B: This move should be left for later as a possible Ko threat. It also takes away  a liberty of your stones. This could become important if your stones have to fight for their lifes.  Are you hoping to get a strong attack against the black stones?]
;B[ad];W[cc];B[bb];W[jc];B[kd];W[jb]C[B: Can black kill your stones? I dont think so.  Therefore you should continue your own attack with R4. R4 is going to be sente. That would make a big difference!]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn]C[B: To heavy. Black should play R10 now and blacks lead would be big. You should play lightly here (and sacrifice the two stones if necessary). Good light moves are O6, R14 and Q10. I would play Q10 here.]
;B[nr]C[B: big mistake by black. He should play R10.];W[pj]
C[B: Good!];B[qh];W[rj]C[i would have liked to play q17, is that possible instead?
B: Q17 is possible! And it is better then your move.  You still have two options with your white group on the right: living on the side with a move like S10 (I like R10 better) or connecting with O5. R10 and O5 can be considered as miai. This means: You dont need to play here.]
;B[kb]C[B: I do not think, that you have to respond to that move. black cannot kill your stones. you will at least be able to live in seki. see variation]

(;W[gb]C[you should rather play R17];B[mr];W[lr];B[er];W[dr]
;B[bn];W[bm]C[B: this is not good. you are creating problems for yourself. simply playing B5 is best. (the trouble is that your stones B7,C7,D6 will become very short of liberties).]
;B[am];W[ao]C[B: B5 is still better. Black should play C5 now, threatening B4 and D5(or D4). white has no good answer to black C5.]
;B[an];W[bo];B[cn];W[qf]C[B: good!];B[oh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]
;B[pe];W[qe]C[B: S14 is better shape. S14 has two nice continuations: S12 and Q14]
;B[pg];W[je];B[lf];W[jf];B[jg];W[nq];B[oq];W[pf];B[of];W[qb]
;B[pb]C[B: This was a good endgame sequence.];W[nj];B[mi];W[gh]

;B[rg];W[rf];B[qa];W[ra];B[pa];W[sb];B[ja];W[ia];B[ka];W[ib]
;B[ge];W[he];B[no];W[lo]C[o7 better instead?
B: No, your move is good. Otherwise black might get a big center (he might consider playing H9)]
;B[nm];W[ol];B[kn];W[sq];B[rq];W[so];B[sr];W[sp];B[qr]C[B: You are playing a very good endgame.]

;W[nl];B[lk];W[ni];B[nh];W[rh];B[qg];W[sg]C[mybe stopping black centre is bigger?
B: you are right. You should first defend your weak stone H8 in sente by playing J10. What other big moves are there?: 
Of the other moves
white B9 is the biggest move (about 4 points in reverse sente, if you accept black A10 as a sente move). your move T13 is half as big (4 points gote move if you are using deiri counting method. 2 points in miai counting method). I think your move comes third in value. It is quite big but not the biggest.]
;B[aj];W[bi];B[gj]
(;W[fj]C[see variation
B: Both variations are about the same.
In the game black gets about 4 more points around H8 (compared to the variation) but also white gets about 4 more points.]
;B[gk];W[hi];B[hk];W[kl]C[B: J10 is better. It has more follow-ups (J12,L10 and J9)]

C[opponent ran out of time, but had 2 minutes to play a move.
anyway b+5.5 is roughly final score.

B: That is right. You were even more behind before the endgame started. You came closer by playing a good endgame, but even with the best endgame the game was probably lost. /B


Overall it was a rather dull game, patient game, i usually like to fight or complicate things

B: but one can also learn from the dull games. In the fighting games you will usually know were you lost (or won). 
By the way: I think you could not start a fight, because you had so many groups to look after. All this started with your move G3 early at the beginning. G3 looks like a fighting move. But in reality, G3 makes sure that you cannot get a strong position anymore (as you always have to many weak groups after that) and therefore you were never able to really attack.
Now that I am at it: One more remark: 
You say: you played territorial as usual. On the other hand you write: you like the fights. I say: Influence and thickness gives the best fights. If you got thickness and influence, that means you are strong, and that means: you can attack! If you are playing for territory and your oponent gets the influence, he has the better position in the fights.

/B


something went wrong, early on mybe i didnt counter black influence enough.
not sure, both played a patient game

thanks

B: your main mistakes were in the opening. You can still see this in the final position: All black stones are more or less connected. you have 5 groups which are not connected (even 6 if you assume you would not have played T13). It is not good to let your groups get isolated in the corners and on the sides. Your stones did not work well together in the opening. If all your stones are somehow connected you can not be attacked. The one who gets attacked is the one with the isolated groups.]
