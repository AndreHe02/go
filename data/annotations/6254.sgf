Margita [2k\]: caos];B[om]C[sharan [6k\]: to sam naucio od bojanica

AB: Up to here it is a completely normal opening.];W[cj]C[Margita [2k\]: to je joseki
sharan [6k\]: ubio me
sharan [6k\]: igrao sdam uvek na q6
sharan [6k\]: sam

AB: Very big, but a play on the upper side might be even bigger.]
;B[od];W[pf]LB[kc:a][ld:b]C[AB: This is the first real mistake I think. The right side is not so interesting. And fourth line is also wrong here as it gives Black an excellent move at R12. But the upper side is much more important, so I think a pincer is a must here. The specific point is less important, but the general idea is that a pincer move would work very well with the White stones at D16 and C10.I think L17 or M16 look good, but I'm not a joseki expert there.]
;B[qc]LB[jc:a]C[AB: Maybe just jump to K17. That punishes White mistake and makes the game favorable for Black. As it is, White might realize his mistake and ignore R17 to play in the vicinity of N17 himself.]

(;W[rc]C[AB: You might consider correcting your mistake by following the variation starting at N17.]
;B[pc];W[rb];B[kc]C[AB: The result is good for Black.];W[cn]
C[AB: Good. White, however, must keep in mind that Black has the excellent move at R12, which simultaneously helps the weakness around Q8 and attacks the White group. That's why a White move at R11 is also very big.]
;B[dn]LB[fp:a]C[sharan [6k\]: e to je vidis defanzivni potez :D

AB: F4 would be normal. It leaves Black with the possibility to invade at C8 later.]
;W[jn]C[AB: Unusual. The Black move can normally not be ignored.]
;B[go]LB[cm:a]C[AB: Black should probably follow up on his own move with C7. Not only is it big, it also weakens the White C10 stone.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[do];W[cm];B[fc]LB[bn:a]C[AB: Good. However, Black could insert a stone at B6. White must answer around B4 or the corner stones will be lost. The B6 stone creates some aji for a C8 follow-up, which may help Black to enlarge his wall in sente.]
;W[hc]LB[df:a]C[AB: Looks risky to me. This stone will become very weak very soon if Black jumps out. The normal move D14 is good here, it works well with C10.]

(;B[cc]C[sharan [6k\]: jee

AB: I think jumping out was clearly the better option here. See variation. White will be in trouble.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[fd]C[now this move surprised me..i expected e16
and i knew if i was going for a win i had to weak that w wall

AB: Yes, E16 would be normal. Well, the first problem is of course that you jumped to 3-3.]

(;B[bc]C[AB: The easiest way to weaken White is to play E16 now. The difference between Black E16 and White E17 is enourmous. Whoever plays first has no cutting points. See variation.]
;W[ec]C[AB: Good.];B[eb];W[ed];B[gc]LB[fb:a]C[AB: Another mistake. If now White G16, then you have two Black stones F17 and G17 with White hane stones on both heads, this is very bad shape. It is better to jsut connect at F18, White will probably play G16 anyway.]
;W[gd];B[be]C[was this a good move too weak the wall

AB: Well, the wall is not so weak, but you reduce the possible territory.]
;W[hb]C[sharan [6k\]: heh];B[fb];W[mc]LB[qi:a]C[AB: Not sure about this invasion. Risky. And White has weak points such as H16 and R12. Maybe a good moment for R11 now.]
;B[md];W[ld];B[lc];W[nd];B[me];W[nc];B[ne];W[oa];B[oc];W[qb]
;B[nb]C[AB: The result is obviously good for Black. All his stones are connected, which also makes M16 look bad.]
;W[qj]C[AB: Good idea, maybe one point too far.];B[qh];W[oh]
C[how to secure the lone stone at
12];B[qg];W[qf];B[pj];W[qk]C[sharan [6k\]: a komentari :)];B[pk]
;W[rl]C[AB: White could possibly hane at Q11. But probably only when very desparate.]
;B[pi]C[Margita [2k\]: posle partije
i went for a contcton

AB: Of course, what else.];W[lo]C[sharan [6k\]: moze.. :D];B[lq]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq]LB[il:a]C[was o3 necesery or would o4 done a better job?

AB: O4 is not better. You might ignore completely if you are willing to give up a couple of points at the bottom. You could launch an attack on the complete group with something like J8.]
;W[lm]LB[jk:a]C[AB: Definitely the White stones need help. However, something lighter like K9 might be more appropriate.]
;B[hd]C[one of 2 the wining moves?

AB: Definitely not small. It seems Black is slightly ahead, so this move is excellent as it assures a risk-free victory.]
;W[he];B[id];W[cg]C[AB: C14 is better, you see later that Black manages to get quite a number of points there now.]
;B[cf]C[AB: Very good.];W[df];B[bg];W[ch]
(;B[mj]LB[ij:a]C[now i wanted to reduce the whites moyo in the center but to remain conection...i didnt find a beter move

AB: Ah, this move looks bad. What moyo would you be referring to :-)? If anything, H10 or so would reduce something. In addition, H10 has the advantage of cutting the escape route of the K6 stones. This actually important. You can attack and at the same time reduce White's potential. That is the way to go. See variation.]
;W[kj]C[AB: Good. Just look at the last two stones. The exchange Black N10 - White L10 is clearly good for White. White stabilizes his stones and simultaneously hints at some possible moyo in the upper left.]
;B[kk];W[jk];B[lk];W[jj]C[AB: The development is reinforced, White should be happy about that.]
;B[dm];W[ek]LB[cl:a]C[AB: Now this is a mistake. The upcoming loss on the left is just too big. White needed to answer with C8.]
;B[cl];W[cr];B[dr];W[bl];B[dk];W[dj];B[ie]C[the second wining move?

AB: Well, in the sense that you would definitely lose if White is allowed to play around there. So yes, this is the only move at this point.]
;W[hf];B[if];W[ig];B[jg];W[ih];B[gl];W[gj];B[el];W[fk];B[qo]
;W[ro];B[bm];W[bn];B[jl];W[il]C[now i saw later that j7 would be good(he would break into h4,j4..but couldnt make two eyes..) in the game iwe just read till the h4,j4 part and played j9 that was bad?]

(;B[hk]C[AB: Bad. K7 was good as it exposes some problems in White's shape. Now. however, once you let K7 be captured White is happy. And H9 serves no real purpose on its own. See variation.]
;W[kl]C[AB: Very good.];B[fl];W[ds];B[es];W[cs];B[er];W[ck]
;B[og];W[lh];B[lg];W[jh];B[kg];W[pg];B[kh];W[li];B[mk]C[AB: Is that a typo? Serves no purpose whatsoever and is bad shape.]
;W[on]LB[pl:a]C[AB: Better capture the R8 stone with Q8. Not small as Black's shape there is not 100% fixed.]
;B[pn];W[nn];B[qm]C[AB: Good!];W[rm];B[nm]C[AB: Small compared to White's next move.]

was s 11 good at all?

AB: Well, you play S12 soon after, so you should probably play S12 here and now.]

;B[rj];W[rk];B[no];W[mo];B[oo];W[mn];B[mi]C[AB: It seems N13 instead enlarges the side where there is actually territory.]

AB: Slight oversight, happens all the time. Nothing to worry about.]
;W[mr];B[mq];W[nr];B[lr]C[sharan [6k\]: :SSSSSS

AB: Not sure, but I think connecting at P3 is better. White cannot enter Black's territory very far here. Only White M2 is possible, Black blocks, then White probably should take O1 already.]

AB: This was a really good game. Especially for Black considering there is a four stone difference in playing level, which didn't show during the game. Black made some oversight errors, but in general both of you should look into shape and direction. Both of you chose a bad joseki once, White in the upper right and Black in the upper left. In addition, White had a bad result from the invasion on the upper side and Black let White get away too easily around K8. These are the most important strategic things from the game.
