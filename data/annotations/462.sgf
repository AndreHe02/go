(;FF[4]SZ[19]PB[jyr]PW[thinpanda]KM[0.5]US[jinroh@ece.rutgers.edu]PC[IGS(igs.nuri.net)]DT[1997-08-19]BR[12k]WR[17k]C[you: This game was played on IGS between 12K strength players(I'm with black).

me: Hello Jin.  My name is Ellery and I am 7k* in IGS.  I noticed that you are 12k and your opponent 17k.  You also held black.  If this is correct then there  is something needing a fix.  Let's find out!];B[dp];W[pd];B[po]C[me: This move is focusing outer influence and no territory.  When playing for influence, you should always attack!];W[dd];B[oq];W[jp]C[me: Good move for W.]
;B[hp]LB[gp:a][fp:b]C[me: B approached from correct direction but leaves his position a little thin.  B has to watchout for a future W invasion at 'b'.  B at 'a' still does the same job and is more secure.

Tip: Secure all your positions and leave no 'holes', then when you attack you'll have no worry about weak groups to defend.  Sacrifice clumsy stones that yield little points.];W[mp];B[jc]LB[dj:a][hn:b]TR[dp][hp]C[you: I always hesitate at this point.  Since I'm not particularly good at making eye shapes, I was playing safe here, instead of putting it closer to white corner stones.

me: Wrong side.  A splitting move is territory oriented and does not work well with your influence strategy.  B at 'a' works better with the marked stones.  Imagine then playing at 'b', a dual purpose move, it attacks the bottom W group as well as mapping out a huge framework.];W[hc]LB[fc:a]C[me: Also leaves 'a' weak but W has to risk a little to gain the initiative.];B[mc]
;W[oc];B[fc]LB[je:a]TR[jc][mc]C[me: Too early.  Your two marked stones are still weak.  B at 'a' is better.  Now you have two weak groups to take care.  Even so, this is playable but complicates the game a little.];W[he];B[fe];W[df];B[dj]LB[fg:a][cc:b]TR[fc][fe]C[you: wouldn't it be better to enter at 3-3 than D10? 

me: Nice move!  Now you have to take good care of your upper groups.  You are now aiming at 'a' which splits W into two.  If W plays at 'a' you play at 'b', and if W captures the two marked stones, you will then have stolen his corner.  The W capture is small and too over- concentrated (too many stones too close together).]
;W[dh]LB[cc:a][ec:b]C[me: Not good.  W is still vulnerable at 'a'.  W should first play 'b' to make B heavy.  If B runs out, W chases him into the center while building influence.];B[db]C[me: Now B can make some eye space.];W[cc];B[cb]LB[je:a][fg:b][hb:c]C[me: Too small and slow.  B at 'a' squeezes W *and* makes shape.  Think about moves which have multiple purposes.  If W jumps out, B follows him at 'b'.  B can still link his two groups with 'c' (do the calculations).]
(;W[kb]LB[je:a]C[me: Bad move.  W should attack from above at 'a', make thickness in the center, and force B to live small.];B[jb]LB[kc:a]C[me: B should take advantage of W attacking from below and press him with 'a', confining him to the second line while building thickiness in the center.];W[lc];B[ld];W[mb];B[kc];W[lb];B[gg]LB[je:a][hg:b][fg:c][hb:d]C[me: B has serious cutting points.  Even though he can link up at 'd', he should defend his cutting point with 'a' *while* attacking the two W stones.  When W jumps to 'b', B follows with 'c' and now the left W group is beginning to look thin.]
;W[if]LB[hg:a][hh:b][ig:c]C[me: W is moving out too slow.  Remember this, when you are weak, attach to the enemy stone and build strength from it (you are also strengthening him so use it wisely).  So W should play at 'a', B 'b', and W 'c'.];B[kf]LB[je:a]C[me: Doesn't quite protect the cutting point but surely attacks W.  As is, B shape has little eye-making potential.  B still needs to play at 'a' to make shape, causing the selected stone to be a little over- concentrated.];W[ih];B[nc]TR[mc]LB[kh:a]C[me: Not good.  The marked stone is cumbersome and should be sacrificed.  It does have some aji though.  Make W run by playing at 'a'. It builds thickness in the center and creates some breathing space for your B group.];W[nb]C[me: A ko threat gone to waste.]
;B[pg]LB[kh:a][ib:b]C[me: B at 'a' is better because your B group can get into trouble.  If W plays at 'b', the B group is floating with little eye shape.];W[of];B[qe];W[qd];B[pe];W[oe];B[qj];W[ei]TR[hc][he][if][ih]C[me: The marked W stones are beginning to look strong by surrounding two B groups.  Also, the lone B stone on the left is now weak.]
;B[cm]TR[dj]LB[gi:a][ej:b][kh:c][hb:d]C[me: The marked B stone is cumbersome but still has potential to attack the upper left W group.  B at 'a', W at 'b', then B at 'c' will give an advantage to B.  If W plays at 'c' instead of 'b', B can still secure his upper middle group with 'd'.];W[kh]LB[hb:a]C[me: B should be very careful now.  If W eliminates B escape at 'a', then B is in big trouble.];B[mh];W[bb]C[me: Securing W left group and removing eye space for the adjacent B group.  Now B has two weak groups.  Looks very hard for B now.];B[hb]C[me: This link-up looks the best way to go now.]
;W[ib];B[ic]C[you: I guess this was beginning of disaster...maybe G18 would've been better than j17.

me: No, this is correct.  The follow-up was a mistake.];W[gb];B[ia]LB[hd:a][ha:b][gd:c]MA[ja][je]C[me: This is the losing move.  The correct move is B at 'a', W at 'b', and B at 'c'.  Then the two 'X' is miai for B.];W[gc]LB[je:a]C[me:  Now the left B group is big trouble.  The upper middle B group has one eye and needs to play at 'a' to live.];B[gd]LB[gi:a][je:b]MA[kd]C[me: It is impossible (in my eyes) to live here.  B should play at 'a' and minimize your losses.  B at 'b' is equally an important move to prevent a W cut at the 'X'.]
;W[hd];B[ge]C[me: To heavy and adds little to eye shape.  If you want to live, you have to run to the center.];W[fb];B[ec];W[ed];B[fd];W[gi]C[me: Doors closed.  B upper left group now dead.];B[hf];W[je]C[me: Upper middle B group now almost dead.];B[ke];W[jd];B[kd]
;W[hh]C[me: W playing safe.  He has 50 in upper left and about 15 in upper right for a total of 65 secure points.  B has about 60 *potential* territory if he can secure it but that is wishing for too much.];B[nn];W[ln];B[ml];W[lg]LB[cq:a]C[me: Not really a clear kill.  Better would be at 'a'.];B[lh];W[kg];B[lf];W[me];B[mf];W[mg]
;B[nf];W[md];B[ng];W[pf];B[qf];W[og];B[oh];W[qg];B[ph];W[nd];B[rg];W[qq]LB[eq:a]C[me: If B kills this W invasion he has about 60 points.  If B lets W live in gote, and closes off the bottom left corner with 'a', he is very much in the game.]
;B[ro];W[op];B[pp];W[nq];B[oo]LB[pq:a]C[me: This move allows W to steal your corner.  B has 40 points in the right side.  But W gained another 15 points.  B now has to secure 40+ points on the bottom left corner.  Very hard.];W[pq];B[np];W[or];B[mq]LB[eq:a]C[me: This won't go anywhere.  Secure bottom left corner with 'a' for a sure 25 points.];W[op]
;B[no];W[lq];B[oq];W[mr];B[iq];W[ep]C[me: This will also do.  W is playing safe and is now reducing B territory framework.];B[dq];W[eq];B[eo];W[fo];B[fp];W[gp];B[fq]
;W[gq];B[er];W[ho];B[fn];W[go];B[gr];W[hr];B[ir]C[me: That's just a free point you gave W.];W[gs];B[fr];W[hq];B[ef]LB[ci:a]C[me: This group is dead.  Go for your other 25 points with 'a'.]
;W[eg];B[ki];W[jh];B[ce]C[me: A good swindle never hurts...];W[de]LB[cd:a]C[me: W defended badly.  W at 'a' would kill B.];B[cd];W[dc];B[bg];W[ch];B[bd];W[cf]
;B[bc];W[eb];B[ab];W[bf];B[ba]C[me: W has about 90 and B has about 70.];W[ck];B[cj]LB[dk:a]C[me: I think B at 'a' would be better.];W[bk];B[bj]LB[dk:a]C[me: B at 'a' would be correct.]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[ej];B[fk];W[bi];B[dl];W[aj];B[cl];W[bl];B[bm];W[ci];B[kl]LB[kk:a]C[me: B at 'a' would be better but B is already behind and the endgame moves is not enough to turn this game around.]

;W[nk];B[oj];W[mk];B[ol];W[ok];B[pk];W[nl];B[om];W[mm]C[you: I resigned at this point.  I made some unreasonable moves to come back from the loss of F16 Group...but it got worse.  I'd like to improve my !
game plans right after opening moves...After placing first 10 or 15 stones, I seem to getting nowhere...

thanks for any comments.

me: B has good tactical skills, but needs to develop more overall strategy.  Focus on moves which has multiple purpose and take care about moves which has negative effect on other B groups.  If one group survives at the cost of others, then the move is no good.  Learn shapes with eye potential.  Moves has to provide for eye shape when invading enemy territory.  Hope these comments help.])
(;LB[hb:a]C[me: This variation shows how to link up your two groups.]W[pj];B[hb];W[ib];B[ic];W[gb];B[hd];W[gc];B[gd]TR[hb]C[me: By sacrificing the marked stone, you have linked your two groups and now W has to worry about making life.]))
