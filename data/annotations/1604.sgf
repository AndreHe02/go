C[hello I was 8k and played black he was 7k ,  no handicap was
given.

:)];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[cc];B[dd]C[I played here so he couldn't close all the  uper side leaving
me strugling for territory  later.


This is fine.  You have started with two 4-4 point stones, so
you are playing an influence game.  Playing here will get you
more moves on the outside, which is consistent with your other
moves.];W[cd];B[de];W[bf];B[dg];W[eb];B[fc];W[cn]
(;B[cl]C[if w runs at E6 it would be chance for me to  get the left side.

But he won't run.  Your move is not good.  When he goes into
the corner, you have to block at C4 above, and he ends up coming
out along your lower side.

Since white can jump out along the left side, it is not big.
You should just play on the right side.];W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[This is the wrong side to block.  When you block on this side
you get a wall facing left, but your opponent has the next move,
so he will play around K3 and you will get nothing for your wall.

If you already have a stone around K3 or K4 you should play this
move, and your wall will be great.  But when you have no stone
in the middle of the side, you should block on the other side.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[bn];B[em];W[jq]C[Joseki in the corner, but a bad result, since white can play
in the center of the side.]
(;B[hp]C[This is also wrong.  The rule is that you attack from the side
away from your wall.  This move is too close to your wall.

I know it is tempting to make territory with your wall, but you
should resist that temptation.  If you attack from the side away
from your wall, you will be stronger.];W[nq]C[I should have made the pincer at L3  but I  got afraid too early
this game];B[qn];W[no]
(;B[qk]C[This move is too small.  Your corner is safe, and there are much
bigger moves available.];W[kc]
(;B[ic]C[This move is not good either.  He responds by securing some territory,
but your move take no territory, since there is a white stone
at e18 undercutting it.];W[nc];B[qf];W[qh];B[of]C[This move says that you plan to attack the white stone and use
your thickness for attack.  If you want to play for territory,
you should jump into the corner above.  Either move is good.
Just a question of style.];W[oh];B[rd];W[qc]
(;B[je]C[But now you abandon the attack and take a small territory instead.
You should continue attacking the two white stones.];W[mh];B[lf]
;W[jo]C[here... I'll try to analize the game...   white has solid territory
in the top right and  left but it's well balanced with black's
influence and the left side.   in the bottom right has still
to make  territory with that loose group of four  stones and
the joseki at the bottom left can  take black ahead in the game...

the three stones in the 12 line can be  attacked and that will
make it even easier  to black dominate the game

*all this is well taken care of (but the upper  black group must
stay together!!!!!)

-> I'd say that white has a slight lead in secure territory,
but black is thicker, so should be able to catch up by attacking
the
3 white stones.  But he has improve his connection at the top
right.]
(;B[jj]C[I was aiming for territory... should have  been at M15? or K12?

You should attack the white stones and take territory while attacking.
Also, your conenction in the upper right is not very good.  Use
the knight move to attack while taking territory.];W[kh]
(;B[jh]C[This is a mistake.  Touching white will make him stronger, and
you don't want him strong here because of your weak connection.]
;W[kg];B[jg]C[Now I see the trouble...

Yes, your stones will be cut off, and have little space to make
eyes.];W[kf];B[ld]C[to connect]
(;W[lc]
(;B[ke]C[But this move doesn't make a connection because of the double
peep.

you switched from connecting to taking territory on the left.]
;W[me]C[Now you will be cut.];B[mf];W[ne];B[nf];W[le]
(;B[kd]C[ahhh! I saw all my game come down to  making one group live...

Why do you play here?  Saving the one stone is not important.
You have to use this move to save the big group to the right.]
;W[rc]C[O15 !!! stupid black!

I don't think o15 helps any.  You really needed to get his move
yourself rather than saving the one stone at L16]
(;B[rg]C[??? ;) next move can still save black if he  cuts...]
;W[rh]C[P12!!!

I don't think P12 works.  See variation.]
(;B[qd]C[no!!!! cut you worthless excuse for a  human!!! P12!!!]
;W[pe];B[pf];W[qg];B[sf]C[Very sad to die in gote.  You must make moves that at least threaten
to live.];W[pr];B[qq];W[hr]C[now might be a good time for the wedge at O12]

(;B[gq]C[White got two huge endgame moves with sente.];W[ji]
C[White found a clever sequence here.  You need to just connect
above.]
(;B[ki]C[I played this in the notion that it still could  be rescued...]
;W[jf];B[if];W[ie];B[ii];W[jd];B[id];W[md];B[he];W[je]C[With all the captures in the upper left, white is way ahead now.]
;B[nh]C[H14 instead would have been of some  worth.

This wedge would have been much more effective earlier, before
your 4 stones got captured.];W[ni];B[ng]C[my plan was to M11]
;W[pi]C[that killed it no matter what];B[mi]C[dohhhhh stupid]
;W[li];B[mj];W[nj];B[lj];W[lh];B[nk]C[White should just make eyes now.]

(;W[pj]C[This is a mistake.];B[oj];W[oi];B[ok];W[pk];B[pl];W[qj]
;B[rk];W[pg]C[Both sides made mistakes in this fight.

If Black wants to win it, he must prevent white from making two
eyes.]
(;B[sh]C[Now white can just make two eyes and win the fight]

(;W[si]C[A big mistake to make a ko when white can just live.]
;B[ri];W[sg]C[If you let white capture a stone, he will make two eyes, so you
have to fight the ko now.]
(;B[rj];W[rf];B[re];W[se]C[now white has two eyes, so the fight is over.]
;B[sd]
(;W[qe]C[This is a mistake.  White should just connect and make two eyes.
Then there is no fight.];B[sf];W[rg];B[og]C[Good.  now it is a real ko.]
;W[se]C[I should have done something with this  ko...

You need to make a really big threat now.  I don't see anything
big enough to make up for the upper right corner.

Your threat is good, since you have such huge outside thickness
now.

Maybe one line higher would be a better threat.  Look forward
to having two moves here and think about wheye both would be
best.]
(;B[lp];W[sc]C[now maybe L6?

yes.  Then white makes life and the game is still close, since
you make a lot of territory.]
(;B[lq];W[ln];B[kn];W[ko]C[You could try peeping and cutting instead.  White gets a lot
of liberties on the outside, but you can attack one of the inside
groups.  I don't think it works for black, but white could make
a mistake.,]
(;B[lo];W[mn]
(;B[mo]C[This move, filling your own liberty, can't be right.]
;W[on];B[np];W[op];B[nr];W[or];B[mq];W[mp]C[had to fiight this ko not give it away...]
;B[pq]C[This move can't help the fight, since it forces white to capture
a tone inside.];W[mr];B[oq];W[np];B[lr];W[ns];B[jn];W[io];B[ip]

(;W[iq]C[White makes a big mistake here, getting cut.  White should just
connect.];B[jp];W[kp];B[kq]C[But since black has only two liberties, white is safe.]
