Hi,My name is Silva,i'm currently 24k on KGS

------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm a Beginner and i don't have much time to read go books or practice with someone because of my Full-Schedule work,so i just playing go at weekend or holiday.but i'm really serious to play go and want to be good at it

------------------------------------------------------------------

I found many bad move and miscalculation in this game,but my common mistakes are finding a timing to invade enemy's territory.hopefully someone stronger can give me solution to prevent it]
;B[pd]C[ - Hello Silva, my nickname on KGS is ckrit (6k). I've tried to keep my review relatively simple, but if you have any questions, feel free to mail me at wolfs.dennis@gmail.com or contact me on KGS. Looking at your game, I can easily say you're stronger than 24k though. :)]

Move 6 - 17 is common Joseki


 - This is a common joseki indeed, but played at the wrong moment.]
(;B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]C[ - As you can see, black was able to make a nice wall in exchange for a relatively small corner.]
(;W[nq]C[
is this response correct??

i think with this move,i can invade the left side without afraid to make a potentially weak stones

 - I think this is a bit too risky since black's corner is strong and your white stone here looks kind of lonesome.]
;B[oo]C[
I Miscalculated this Black's move,so i'm trying to secure life]

 Is J3 is a correct response?? i think if i played J3, i can make the G3 stone weak,and help me to advance to the center

 - In this situation, this seems fine to me, your right group becomes stronger and the marked stone is put under pressure. G4 seems like a bad move now.]
;B[qj]LB[eq:A]TR[gp]C[
 Is left side still open to attack??? after B r10???

 - Don't worry, the marked stone is weak now so you can always try to reduce on the right, while planning an attack black's lonely stone.

You can also directly attack the marked stone by playing at A to secure your corner and force the black stone to run into the center.]
(;W[hn]C[
 I choose to advance to the center];B[jc]TR[ja][ka][la][jb]
[kb][lb]C[
 I think this move really hurts my shape at the upper-left corner

 - This seems to like a pretty useless move at the moment, black only possible gains a few extra points.]
(;W[hc]LB[nj:A]C[
 Bad move for me

 - Yes, your white group is safe, so you needn't worry about playing around here. Something around A is still bigger.]
;B[mn]C[- And now invading suddenly seems a lot more difficult.]
(;W[pr]C[- This seems too small at the moment. It's high time to do something about black's growing moyo.]
;B[qr];W[or];B[ll]LB[lj:A]C[

 B is trying to advance to the center

 - Black is playing inefficient moves, so maybe something around A would be a bit safer. Try not too jump too deep when black is crowded so much. Make it possible to escape after you invade.]
;W[oh]LB[mh:A]C[

 I think this invasion is a little awkward,but is there any other place to invade??

 - The cap at A would make your invasion a bit hopeless.]
(;B[oj];W[lh];B[mb];W[ji];B[dh];W[jl]C[

 Is this k8 move correct???

 - In this situation it seems good. You're trying to connect stones that are floating in the center to a safe group.]
;B[ej];W[gi]LB[qh:A]C[ - This move doesn't do much I feel right now, maybe R12 can be an attempt to split two black groups? Black's wall isn't quite alive yet either.]

 I'm trying to separate the Black group,but is this L17 move is asking too much??

 After B 93 move,my W 90 looks like a wasted move

  Bad move again

 Im' trying to separate the square marked stones and the triangle marked stones,and then reduce the right side territory
