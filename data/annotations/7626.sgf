C[Hello, I hope you'll like my review. I start my comments with [twold\]. Enjoy.]
;B[qp];W[pc];B[dc];W[cp];B[cm]LB[cj:C][cm:A][eq:B]TR[jc][ce]
C[[Actorios\] Did I have to answer such approach move ? I didn't feel forced to do so.

[twold\] This b move is dubious. There is no point in approaching komoku from this side. You should just take a corner here with B and the A-B exchange is obviously already bad for black (tenuki is also fine if you know what you're doing. But be prepared for b's double approach at B later). Like it is, b needs to play a move around C to get a base, but this is in no connection with the top black stone. Komoku should be developed as shown in triangle formation -- first shimari, then extension.]
;W[qe]LB[eq:A]TR[cm]C[[twold\] This is fine, but maybe bottom left is more important. There is a great difference in pressure between w or b taking A. Still, this move is better than b's triangled stone, so I like w a bit more right now.]
;B[kc]LB[jc:A][ce:B]C[[Actorios\] I was surprised by this move so far away? I wondered if I should have had extended up to N17 (but black would have taken a big point by playing around G16. 

[twold\] No, shimari was alright, if you wanted to play in this area. You could also play A, but then obviously the corner would be still be open from the right (just as b's is open from the left at B), so it doesn't matter much. Also, the triangled stone is maybe little too close to the shimari.

As for G16, that is not a big point at all. Komoku is assymetric for a reason -- to follow it with another move. You should try to make a shimari to balance it. So correct direction for b would to play at B. A is also playable, but a little worse, as b doesn't have such a great prospects on top because of w's shimari.]
;W[oq];B[qm]LB[po:B][mq:A]C[[twold\] This is quite submissive. Better options are at A or B.]
;W[lq]LB[eq:A]C[[twold\] This is also a bit slow, but maybe ok because of A weakness.]
;B[fq];W[eq]LB[dq:A][hq:B]C[[Actorios\] Don't know if it was good to touch the stone but I wanted to keep the corner rather than running away..

[twold\] It is almost never good to touch a stone. Only exception is when running away with invasion when you strengthen yourself by attaching and sacrificing. Instead of this, just playing A is fine. But here I feel like you should take B and fight. 

As for keeping a corner: it's almost always better to get out to the center than thinking about points (especially this soon in the game). If you get sealed in, you could get a few points, but your group will have no influence what-so-ever for the rest of the game.]
;B[ep]LB[fp:A]C[[twold\] Bad response. B could have used w's attaching move to strengthen himself at A. Instead, he just created a cutting point there.]
;W[dq];B[fo];W[gp];B[fp]LB[fo:C][fp:A][gp:B]TR[ep]C[We can think of this exchange as being played in other order (it's called tewari analysis) with A-B-C exchange. Both of B-C are bad plays of course, but usually the one who plays last bad move in tewari is worse off. Here it's b and it shows that C wasn't a good move in the first place (in fact, triangle stone started all the problems). On the other hand, B is also not so good, because there's no need to play there right now for either player. You just used up what could have been a ko threat. Such a move B is called a forcing move and usually should be kept for as late as possible.]
;W[ip]TR[gp]C[[twold\] No need to play here at all. You certainly shouldn't be trying to save the marked stone. It's sole purpose was to force b into bad shape and can be discarded now.]
;B[go]C[[twold\] Bad. No need to play here.];W[hp]C[[twold\] Bad again...]
;B[ci];W[ce]C[[Actorios\] I havv trouble invading (always feel clumsy and I don't like to be forced to run away) but I felt I had to do something here

[twold\] This is not called invasion. B has just three stones in this area and moreover very far apart. Plenty of space for you to manage here. This was a correct point to start from in this area (as it was a normal corner approach).]
(;B[gc]LB[cd:A]TR[ci]C[[twold\] Very soft move. B should attack w more strongly with triangled pincer in place. See the sequence from A.]
;W[bc]C[[twold\] Very good. Taking a base is a first thing you should do with a weak group.]
;B[cb];W[bh]LB[ee:A][bh:B]TR[ch][bi]C[[twold\] Diagonal play under opponent's stone is usually quite bad, as he can choose either of the marked points, both of which make his stone strong and yours weak. I know you wanted to settle this group, but just getting out with A is fine here. You can play at B anytime later when you feel like your group needs to live.]
;B[ch];W[bg];B[ee]TR[bc][ce][bg][bh]C[[twold\] Here we can see how b sealed w in. As I said before, this is always bad. The marked group is as good as dead for the purpose of play in the center.]
;W[df];B[ef];W[dg];B[eh]C[[Actorios\] Should have I tried to force some cutting points ?

[twold\] Not really. B is strong outside, so he would handle it comfortably. You would be just reducing your liberties.]
(;W[bb]LB[bi:A][bj:B]TR[eg][dh]C[[Actorios\] I felt I needed more space

[twold\] I feel like you are already alive. Therefore this is a pass. If you really wanted to add a move to this group, then A was better because it invades b's framework (also, if he'd answer B, there's potential of cut in the marked area).]
;B[nc];W[qj]LB[qh:A]C[[twold\] This is a bit far. A would be ok. Like this, b can play A himself and attack your stone (of course, his stone would also be attack, because shimari is strong, so he would have to plan the attack carefully, to actually gain something). Generally, you never want to play close to strong opponent's position.]
;B[oo]LB[qh:A][in:B]C[[twold\] I don't understand this move, it doesn't do anything. B could either attack with A, or play B to build center.]
;W[lo]LB[ph:A][jj:B][im:C]C[[twold\] Again, I don't understand. Either defend at A, or get into center with something like B. Or something calmer like C.]
;B[mn]LB[ph:A]TR[qj]C[[twold\] Again, almost a pass. It does have a little influence over the marked stone, but that would be pointless as soon as you defended it at A.]
;W[oe]C[[twold\] Last few moves, including this one, were all very small and unimportant.]
;B[ph]C[[twold\] Finally an attack.];W[oj];B[nh];W[mj];B[mf]
LB[lh:A]SQ[fd][gd][hd][id][jd][kd][fe][ge][he][ie][je][ke][ff]
[gf][hf][if][jf][kf][fg][gg][hg][ig][jg][kg]C[[twold\] Strange shape. Just A is correct. If carried out successfully, the attack would get b all the marked area. Like this w can hope to live and damage b's center at the same time.]
;W[ng]C[[twold\] These cuts are almost never good, because in a the process you will also damage your own group (because it's so close).]
;B[mg];W[og]
(;B[ni]LB[oh:A]C[[twold\] Very very bad. B just let w cut at A and take huge right territory. B should of course just connect at A. See the sequence.]
;W[oh];B[lh]C[[twold\] I don't see a purpose of this move.]
;W[nj]LB[im:A]C[[twold\] Not bad as a means of reducing center a little, but for that purpose I prefer A.]
;B[kj];W[li];B[ki]
(;W[oi]C[[twold\] This is a pass. See variation.];B[mh]C[[twold\] This is almost worthless -- saves just two unimportant stones in gote.]
;W[ck]LB[bi:A]C[[twold\] This should probably die if b answers at A. B is very strong around here.]
(;B[dk]LB[bi:A]C[[twold\] Big mistake. Should have played at A.]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[bj];B[bi];W[ai];B[cj];W[bl];B[dn];W[dh];B[ei]
;W[md]C[[twold\] This is easily cut and so dies.];B[nd];W[ne]
;B[me];W[ld];B[lc];W[ke];B[kg];W[mc];B[kd]LB[mb:A]C[[twold\] Very bad. Should have just connected at A.]
(;W[le];B[mb];W[nb];B[ob]
(;W[je]C[[twold\] Why play with the dead group? :-) B can just tenuki here.]
;B[na]LB[qb:A]C[[twold\] Too careful. If anything here, should just play A to get into corner.]
;W[ic];B[jd];W[id];B[ie];W[oc];B[if]LB[pb:A]C[[twold\] No need for this move. Instead should have played A to reduce w's territory.]
;W[od];B[nb];W[pb];B[jf]C[[twold\] Pass...];W[in];B[il]LB[hm:A]
C[[twold\] Very strange move. Should have been at A to protect the territory.]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[gm];B[fl];W[km]C[[twold\] Does this move get any points at all?]
;B[kl]C[[twold\] And this?];W[lm];B[nl]LB[pa:A][qq:C][hr:B]
C[[twold\] Again, last few moves were passes. Points in the endgame are usually near the side of the board, like A, B, C, etc...]
;W[qq]
(;B[pp]LB[rq:A]C[[twold\] A bad move. Should have defended at A.]
;W[rq];B[pq];W[pr];B[rp];W[or];B[ln];W[kn];B[mo];W[mp];B[np]
;W[nq];B[ll];W[mm];B[nm];W[ml]C[[twold\] What exactly does this move do?]
;B[fm];W[no]C[[twold\] Why using up ko threats?];B[nn];W[op]
C[[twold\] This isn't even ko threat. It's a pass.];B[no]C[[twold\] Pass...]
;W[ro]LB[sp:A]C[[twold\] Bad. Should have played sente A of course.]
;B[sp];W[rm]C[[twold\] Very bad again, loses many points here.]
;B[rl];W[qn];B[pm];W[po];B[pn];W[qo];B[so]C[[Actorios\] Didn't read this sequence... I should have tried to

[twold\] Happens to all of us :-)];W[rk];B[sl];W[ql];B[pl];W[qk]
;B[rn];W[sk];B[sm];W[dd];B[ed]LB[ec:A]C[[twold\] Playing at A is better shape for b. But this is also fine.]
;W[eb]C[[twold\] Nice spot, but it doesn't work. See variation.]
(;B[ec];W[db];B[cc];W[ca];B[cd];W[bd];B[de];W[bf];B[fb];W[da]
C[[twold\] This is not so big, just two stones. Try to look for bigger spots.]
;B[im];W[hn];B[mk];W[ko];B[lj];W[bn]C[[twold\] This looks ok, but the exchange that followed was very complicated and I think you lost a little in the process.]
;B[bm];W[am];B[bo];W[cn];B[co];W[dm]
(;B[do]C[[twold\] Not necessary, b was already connected.];W[bp]
;B[ao];W[fr];B[gr];W[es];B[gq];W[ir];B[cr]C[[twold\] Again, nice spot that doesn't work.]

;W[gh];B[gi];W[jl]C[[Actorios\] Totally unrealistic... I didn't use enough of my time to think about the last moves. I think I felt I was losing anyway... which was untrue at that time]
;B[jm];W[cg];B[ho];W[io]LB[pa:A][sr:B]C[[twold\] Very small moves were being played. A and B are very large and being ignored whole time.]

[qn][sn][eo][po][qo][ro]C[[twold\] I think you play quite well, but there are obviously some areas you could improve in. First, in the fuseki, try to concentrate on the most urgent areas (as opposed to biggest areas). You'll recognize them as areas that both your opponent and you want to play in. The same principle should of course be applied during the whole game. Also, you often played completely useless moves. Try to recognize the effect of the played move before you play it. If it is small (or negative...), try to find something better. There always is something. Hard part is finding it :-) Last point is endgame. Again, many unimportant moves were played. First principle is, try to look at the sides, that's where biggest moves are. Second, always play sente and try not to follow your opponent around the board.

That's about it. If anything is unclear, or you have further question, please go ahead and ask.]
