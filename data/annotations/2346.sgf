C[Dieter Verhofstadt:

When there are comments of yours, (dv) will precede mine.

There
are three levels of comments: strategy, tactics (reading) and technique.
I think your strategic insight and your technique are not so different from
mine, so the only level at which this comment can make a difference is reading.
Then again, I can read badly too in server games, and when commenting a game
on a quiet evening, I see more than when wrapped up in a game.]

If he answers, you can extend to 16 or 'b'. There is no cut in 10-a, because the ladder works for you.

If he doesn't answer or plays around 16, you can attack his corner. His shape is quite weak and 'c' is a severe attack.]

;B[ko];W[kr];B[mr]C[The
24-25 exchange is aji-keshi. You want to keep the option of using his cutting
points to help an invasion of the corner. Moreover, your shape is not so
good.];W[mn];B[km];W[ml];B[ho];W[go];B[hp];W[fr];B[gp];W[fp]

LB[eo:a][ir:b][nf:c]C[When Black strengthens his center stones, it is time to perceive the global position.

-
From a perspective of the first principle of Go, "connect", a move at 'a'
jumps to the eye, capturing 35 in a ladder. (push up once).

- The bottom: is it alive without the aforementioned connection ? There is a nasty invasion at 'b'.

-
The right side looks like a huge Black moyo, but there is plenty of space
to invade, backed up by the White wall in the middle. 

- The big White wall can be strengthened by a connecting hane at 'c'.

So,
the question here is whether you have time to make the strengthening moves
at 'a' and 'c',  how many moves Black needs to turn the right side into perfect
territory and whether that would put you at a clear disadvantage.

Though
my first instinct was to play 'a', I would now treat 'a' and 'b' as miai,
sacrificing three stones at either center or bottom, and invade the right
side to prompt Black's response.

A stronger player than me might have
a clearer view on the right side and see 'a' as a connect/cut move or calmly
play 'c' as a strengthening/weakening move.];W[gk]LB[eo:a]C[So, when deciding to play in this area, 'a' is the only move.]
;B[gj];W[fk];B[hl];W[em]C[Missing the ladder is one thing, deliberately destroying it is worse.]
;B[eo];W[jd]LB[nf:a]C[When playing in this area, 'a' looks like the only move.]
;B[hq];W[hr]LB[ir:a][iq:b][hs:c][gs:d]C[Black can follow up with a to d, leading to a ko.]
;B[fj];W[ej];B[ei];W[dj];B[mf];W[lf];B[me];W[kg];B[rd];W[qc]
;B[ni];W[lj]LB[nh:a]C[I understand this is an attempt to connect in sente. However, this empty triangle is problematic.

First,
Black doesn't really have to answer it. Second, if he does, a Black stone
at 'a' becomes sente. It is better to simply connect, wait for Black's move
to come which will try to turn his moyo into territory and then decide whether
to invade or reduce.];B[li]C[This move however, is far and far worse,
because it forces you to correct an earlier mistake, leaving a cut with higher
cost.];W[mi]
(;B[nj]LB[ir:a][fi:b]TR[lq][mq][mr][nr]C[So he walls of his moyo, confident that no life can be made inside it. 

If
he is right in his assessment, he has 50 points on the right side, 15+ points
in center and lower left corner together and a ko against the White bottom.
While we're at it, let's look at the bottom group (var).

Even if he
is not right, an invasion of the right side will be a source of ko-threats.
White has little to match Black's territory: only 'b' can account for a severe
cut. When behind, one needs a plan.

My plan would be to invade the
right side, hoping to somehow secure the bottom group in the process, ideally
by capturing the marked stones.];W[kj]C[The plan you seem to follow is
to weaken his center group and threaten to kill it. I believe you ignored
the fact that the bottom is ko and that you agreed that the right side was
hardly invadable, so I understand your plan.];B[jj];W[ji];B[ii]
;W[jh];B[jk]C[At
this new resting point, nothing has fundamentally changed in the problem
setting for the game.];W[fi]C[Taking into account your alleged judgment
of right side and bottom, this cut is indeed the best way to get back into
the game.];B[gi];W[fg]C[I misplace a stone here, it should be at F12.

(dv)
I am sorry but I do not understand that your opponent did not let you undo
this move. Second, I think this highly devaluates the quality of the game
to be reviewed.];B[fh];W[cg]C[This move does not take the global position
into account. Even if the bottom were alive, there must be done something
about his right side. Moreover, locally you play close to your and your opponent's
strength.];B[eg];W[ec]C[Locally, this is a good move, securing quite some territory and reducing his leverage possibilities at the top.]
;B[mc];W[nf]C[This
move is more like the spirit: threatening to cut off his stones or reduce
his right side. The problem is that he can afford to lose something on the
right, because your corner will be captured if he secures his top stones.
Good idea.];B[ne];W[of];B[oe];W[nh];B[og];W[oh];B[pg];W[pi]
;B[oi]C[Bad
shape, a bad judgment of the global position also. Black should give up some
stones, secure half of his right side and capture the top right.

He gives you a chance and you seize it wonderfully.];W[nl];B[ok]

;B[qq];W[or];B[qr];W[lr]C[In
twenty moves, you completely turned the tables. The bottom is now secure
with some 15 points. His right side is cut to pieces. The offer you had to
make was the top right. 90 an 112 were daring moves to which he poorly responded.
His lower right contains aji too.

The game has become quite even now.];B[ns];W[os];B[rc]LB[kb:a]
[cm:b][ef:c][rn:d]C[Black captures the corner and you are to play.

In
what follows, you try to save the corner. This is unreasonable. The stones
already have done a wonderful job, Black has invested a lot in capturing
them. They should now be sacrificed with the highest possible benefit. 'a'
for example, makes territory while threatening to save them. Or you can leave
them as aji and play big endgame moves such as 'b', 'c' or 'd'.]
;W[rb];B[nb]C[This exchange loses aji and points.];W[sc];B[re]

end of comments.
-----------------------------

Conclusion: 

First
advice: although server games are difficult in this, I think your biggest
area for improvement is reading Life & Death:

- you misjudged the upper left and allowed ko
- you misjudged the upper right, but fortunately so did your opponent
-
 you misjudged the lower side, which lived in ko, but your opponent didn'
see it either, and you saved the stones by capturing some in the lower right.
-
you misjudged the kothreat Black 183, guessing the group could live on its
own, even though taking the ko and accepting the loss, was probably correct

"Get strong at life and death" by Bozulich contains a lot of positions like the ones you miscalculated.

Second
advice: at times one has to make a positional judgment and adapt one's strategy
to it. You were able to invade the right only because Black refused to give
up a couple of stones. A better plan was needed and earlier in the game.

Third
advice: don't try to rescue lost stones such as the ones in the upper right,
especially when you are slightly ahead. Better sacrifice them and use them
to take profit nearby.


Hope to see you around,
