C[Hi, I played black in this game.  I lost by resign since I couldn't kill his group and my own group got killed.  I've having trouble killing my opponents groups lately.  Even though after the game, I found I could have him killed.  Arr.  Any comment appreciated!

(;B[jc];W[nd]TR[jc]C[Sasa: White immediately used the influence to mount an attack. Playing with the upper side stone can easily become heavy, so you could consider just sacrificing it.]

(;B[gc]C[I decided to settle my group.  Not sure if it's the best move.]
;W[ec];B[pf];W[lc];B[oc];W[od];B[pc]TR[qe][qh]C[Sasa: This shape has problem for black at R15, so it has to be handled with care. White can later step in at R12.]

Sasa: I like this move. It looks like white can get a good result no matter what black tries.]
