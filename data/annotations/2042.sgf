C[fredb [24k?\]: hi
akoni [25k?\]: hi

Dear Go Teaching Ladder reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time to review this game. I played White, and I tried to play much more carefully and methodically than I often do. I've been reading Go books and websites, and I tried to apply what I've been learning. I would really appreciate your comments on my moves, especially the mistakes you see.

As you can see, the players' ranks are approximately KGS 24k and 25k. I don't know what the equivalent IGS rank might be, since I've never played there. After the game I reviewed it myself and I added all the comments you see (except those preceded by "fredb [24k?\]:" or "akoni [25k?\]:").

I look forward to reading your comments.

Thanks,

-Fred

MM: Hi Fred, this is Mike Malveaux, the GTL reviewer. I will do my best to provide a useful review, worthy of your serious attitude toward the game. However, I am only 8k AGA, so take my opinions with a bit of salt.]
;B[pd];W[cp]C[I took the opposite komoku to try for a shimari.

MM: This more or less prevents a 'diagonal fuseki' and initiates a 'parallel fuseki'. Some folks think the parallel fuseki is preferable, though Cho Chikun apparently favors the diagonal when playing as White.

http://senseis.xmp.net/?ParallelFusekiOptimal
http://senseis.xmp.net/?TasukiFuseki];B[dc];W[pq]TR[ep][fp]
[eq][fq][po][pn][qn][qo]C[I've seen this pattern of balanced komoku so I tried it. Hoping for another shimari.

MM: My understanding of 'shimari' is that it's the Japanese term for 'corner enclosure'. Strictly speaking, these stones by themselves don't enclose either corner. I think another stone is needed in each corner before it can be considered a shimari. I marked the most common places to add a stone to make shimari - e4, f4, e3, f3, etc.]
;B[ce]C[MM: Here, Black has a shimari in the upper left.];W[qo]
C[To stay balanced with Black's shimari.

MM: Yes; now White has a shimari too.];B[dn]C[MM: This may not be 'wrong', but in this situation, I think Black usually approaches with a kakari around e3, trying to ruin White's chance to make two shimari that mutually support each other. I suppose Black is trying for a grand double-wing formation this time; perhaps too ambitious.]
;W[ep]C[Secure the corner, extend toward LR shimari, don't get enclosed.

MM: Good.];B[cm]LB[jd:B][dj:A][pj:C]SQ[bn][jj]C[I expected Black to play around A, B, or C.

MM: Those are all big points. Nothing wrong with Black wanting to wall you out of the left side; but B6 might work better. Here my own temptation would be to try K10 or nearby; but that's because I enjoy middle-game fighting. (Stronger players constantly tell me I play too thinly; K10 might be a good example of a bad move.)]
;W[jp]LB[pj:A]C[At the time, I thought this was a big move, extending from both shimari, securing some territory and preventing an immediate invasion. In hindsight I wonder if I should have extended near A instead. The move at A isn't the best extension from my LR shimari, but maybe it would prevent the weak groups I ended up having to defend.

MM: This is okay, though maybe a little slow. But it pretty strongly claims the lower side for White. A 6-dan I know often says 'make yourself strong first, then you can do whatever you want to do'. Here White has no weakness I can see. But having said all that, your Q10 idea also looks good.]
;B[qj]C[MM: Ok, Black has the beginnings of a fearful moyo; but it is open to invasions. Meanwhile, White has claimed only the lower side, and though Black can invade and live small, it will be hard to live big in White's area of influence. So far, this looks more or less even to me.]
;W[jd]LB[gd:A][md:B][di:C]C[I wanted to prevent a double wing from Black's UR corner, and I knew that the two-point extensions from this stone to A and B were miai. Also, compared with invading at C, this move obeys the rule about playing away from strength. After seeing how the game turned out, I think I should have played on the third line instead of the fourth, because I ended up with no base on the top edge, just floating in the center.

MM: Yes, normally this invasion is at K17, to more easily get a base on the side. Here the move you played may be proper though; Black might be happy to force you low and small, thereby gaining a wall to dominate the center. It's hard for Black to do that with your stone up on the 4th line already.]
;B[mc]SQ[nc][nd]C[MM: Looks thin to me. Either Black will have to reinforce, or White will be able to invade the corner. Probably O17 or O16 is enough.]
;W[gd]SQ[hc]C[I think this is the best extension. Any farther and Black could play in between my two stones. This also takes away Black's best shimari extension around the same point. Again, maybe at least one of these two stones should have been on the third line.

MM: I'm not strong enough to comment confidently, but I'll take a stab.
   This extension might ok, but don't consider these two stones alive yet. Black is lower than you on both sides. For example, how would White answer B at h17 (square)? White can probably make two eyes in the center, or one on the upper side and one in the center, but Black will have fun attacking and building walls that face Black's areas of strength.
   I do think g17 or h17 might be safer for White. But this might be ok, if your aim is to press Black low while you take the center.]
;B[di]C[MM: Good move.];W[pg]LB[qg:A][oj:B]TR[qj]SQ[ph][qf]
C[I was trying to put a weak pincer on Black's marked stone, keep his groups divided, start to enclose the UR corner, and indirectly support my stones at the top. I think a move on the third line at A would just get swallowed up. This ended up becoming a weak group that got chased around the board. In hindsight, I wonder if the capping move at B would have been better, accomplishing the same goals without creating a new weak group.

MM: I think capping at P10 ('b') is possible, but might get complicated quickly. Your actual move at Q13 is probably the right idea; though perhaps not the best possible spot - Q12  is probably where I would play, with the idea of building strength while attacking Black's R10 stone from a distance. I think playing on the third line is also possible, but probably not at R13 ('a'); R14 is fairly standard. Either Black has to defend the corner, and White can attack the R10 stone; or Black defends the R10 stone, and White can live in the corner, with the threat of connecting to the Whites on the upper side.]
;B[qh];W[qg]C[I consider the shoulder hit by Black to be a contact-fight threat on my weak stone, so I can't ignore it. I'm glad Black didn't play at this point (R13) himself, because now I'm able to continue to separate his groups while maintaining a solid connection and five liberties.

MM: Looks heavy to me, but it's probably ok since the corner is still open.]
;B[qm];W[nf]TR[pg][qg]SQ[ph]C[A kogeima from relatively strong stones (marked), reaching toward my upper group and threatening to enclose Black's UR corner. Since my upper group has eyespace and the two marked stones don't, I need to run them out as efficiently as possible while maintaining connection.

MM: I'm not sure this is the way. First off, your two stones on the upper right don't quite have 'eyespace' yet. Second, I think your keima can be cut. Third, there's a proverb that says something like 'feint in the east before attacking in the west'; and I think it's apt here. I would play P12 first; if Black doesn't answer, White probably kills the stones on the right, and the game still looks balanced. If Black answers, then White's stones are stronger and can better support a connecting jump into the center.]

(;B[le]C[MM: Looks natural.];W[jf]C[Keeping the pressure on Black. I could have extended from the other group, and maybe I should have, but I didn't want Black to run over and join with his strong left side.

MM: It looks to me like the pressure is on White.];B[lg]C[MM: This looks very bad for White. White has two weak, eyeless groups that are cut apart; Black's groups also don't yet have eyes, but at least they have a base; and they're almost connected, as well.]
;W[nh]C[Running out, keeping Black separated, putting pressure on the right side group, assisting my weak UR group.

MM: var.]
(;B[mi];W[oj]LB[mi:25]C[I ignored the shoulder hit from B25 because I have enough friendly stones nearby, and I want to keep running out and enclosing the side group.]
;B[ol]SQ[nj]C[MM: I think O10 works better for Black. It quickly gets complicated, but in the variations I tried, Black can cut and probably kill, as long as he doesn't mind sacrificing a couple stones.]
;W[nk]C[Now I'm the one running through a hole, using a diagonal connection for safety and speed.]
;B[mm];W[lk]C[The one point extension gets me into the open and keeps Black separated.

MM: White still looks thin and heavy; if Black will sacrifice a couple stones, then Black can exploit some cutting points. In most of the variations I tried, Black seems to come out ahead, even if White manages to stay connected. (I left some of these in to give you an idea of 8k scheming; hopefully this clutter can be forgiven.)]

(;B[np]C[MM: Looks reasonable, considering how weak White is above.]

(;W[mq]LB[nq:A]C[Black reduces my space, but I want to keep my corner and side connected. Would the move at A  or somewhere else be better?

'A' at O3 also seems cuttable; but it might be tactically better anyway.]
;B[nq];W[mr]SQ[on][nr]C[Extending down instead of up to prevent Black from getting the hane at the head of two and to keep the chance of connecting underneath to my corner.

MM: Looks dangerous; it might be time to reinforce the corner instead. If Black makes the natural move at O2, the corner will be in severe danger. Or, maybe White should fight back with something like P6. Yes, I like that best -- take advantage of Black's cutting points.]
;B[lo]C[MM: Bad move -- Black should O2!];W[jn]TR[nh][nf][pg]
[qg][mm][lo][np][nq]SQ[on][pk][nr]C[Reaching toward my center stones, enclosing Black and expanding the potential territory on the bottom. Too ambitious?

MM: I think you must not have seen quite how much danger there is to the White lower right corner, and to the Whites around Q13. But Black has weak spots too, so it's a fair fight. O2 is big, and important; but I don't think you can take the time for it now; if Black gets in a stone near L8, it looks kind of bad for White.  'A one-space jump is never wrong.' Still, I'd prefer to strike from the inside with P6, or maybe Q9. And if necessary, I'd be willing to sacrifice the four stones around Q13, in exchange for capturing the Blacks around N7.]
;B[kl]SQ[ll]C[MM: Ok, thanks to that last move at K6, White should be able to cut this and do well. Black's keima is no good here; probably M8 would have been better.]
;W[kk]C[MM: ? Why not M8?];B[jl];W[jk];B[il];W[ik]C[I was pretty happy with this wall since my side faces my stones at the top and Black's side doesn't face anything as big. Still, it separates my groups and lets Black connect his stones, so maybe I should have played differently.

MM: This turns out ok, since Black's not patching up his weak spots. But M8 looks like the natural move to me.]
;B[gl];W[gn]LB[fb:A][kb:B]SQ[dq][gq][fo][io]C[Although I'm still wide open in the center, I wanted to try to claim a big area on the bottom. The area I claimed is probably unreasonably large, although it worked out well enough. Is there a better move I should have played at this point?

MM: A little ambition is good; just realize that the area you're claiming on the bottom *is* still invadable or reducable... you may have to fight to defend it. Starting with D3 and followed by G3, Black can either make a living group or connect to friendly stones by capturing a few Whites; and there are weaknesses at J5 and F5. But, the adage 'the best defense is a good offense' applies... attack those thin Black stones, and you'll have no problems.


Maybe I should have tried to secure territory at the top so my groups wouldn't end up floating in the center, but if I try to close off around A, then Black can slide in around B, and vice versa. "Territory that is open on both sides is not territory."

MM: Yes; you are high and undercut, so you will have trouble finding eyes on the side. Again, best to attack while Black is still weak. Your new wall in the center will help.]
;B[iq]SQ[nj][gq]C[MM: Sure, why not invade that juicy loose framework? But this is probably not the right spot. White's natural responses will crush Black. Black should try G3 instead. Actually, Black should first take care to fix his weak spots. Something like O10 first would help Black a lot.]
;W[jq]C[Responding to the shoulder hit, keeping Black separated, keeping five liberties to Black's three.

MM: Of course; good.];B[fq];W[eq]C[Same thing.];B[fp];W[fo]
C[Hane at the head of two, keeping Black enclosed, connecting my stones.

MM: White has good shape. Black is toast on the lower side. The upper side and center remain unsettled; whoever gets in a good move there first will have a big advantage.]
;B[hn];W[ho]C[Black attached, so I chose outside hane and made a tiger shape.

MM: This is good for White. The other hane, at H7, also seems to be playable; but it's probably too greedy. This H5 is enough.]
;B[io];W[in]C[I could cut, so I did.];B[hm];W[ip]C[Keep Black separated, and create the atari for a potential future eye.

MM: Good. I'm not sure it's necessary -- maybe White can tenuki, and get the party started in the north; but probably better to be safe than sorry.]
;B[hp];W[go]C[This makes an empty triangle on the outside, but since I've got the black stone in atari, I'm not too worried about having only four liberties.

MM: Here, you might as well capture. You'll probably have to eventually anyway; and it leaves fewer ko threats in the meantime.]
;B[gq];W[ir]C[I saw Black's empty triangle, and this seemed like the best way to take advantage of it.

MM: Since you're connected around the stones, it's probably time to tenuki. Even if Black manages to live here with two measly points of territory, the unsettled upper side is much bigger and more urgent.]
;B[eo]C[MM: Well, I guess it's ok to dream.];W[qc]C[Was this a good or a bad time for this san-san invasion? The outside Black wall will threaten my almost-enclosed stones, but my eventual live group in the corner will let me threaten and take eyespace away from Black's UR stones.

MM: A good time; maybe even a few moves late. I'm not sure if White has a better spot to attack; but this certainly looks bleak for Black. I'm glad you mention your 'almost-enclosed' stones... What happens if Black gets to move at O10?]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd]C[MM: ??  I guess Black was needlessly worried about the cut at P16.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[rg]C[MM: Looks good for Black; but you can cut, by sacrificing a stone at S12.]
;W[nb];B[nc]C[MM: Wasted move, I think.]
(;W[mb]TR[nb]C[I haven't learned any joseki yet, but this looks like a reasonable exchange to me. My corner group can't be killed, can it? Should I have played it differently?

MM: I haven't learned any joseki either. I'm pretty sure your corner is alive after O18 (triangle). This move should be spent fixing your cutting points, or attacking Black's cutting points; or preferably both at once.]
;B[kb]C[MM: Ineffective.];W[kc]C[Maintaining pressure and separation against Black, threatening to connect my stones.]
;B[jb];W[dg]LB[ll:1][nl:2]C[I was hoping to secure a large area in the center. I'm not sure if this is ordinarily a good idea, although it worked in this case. I've learned that territory in the center is not as big as it looks because it can be squeezed in from all sides. Is there a better strategy I should have been using at this point (or more likely *before* this point)?

MM: Right; in many games, a lot of the center ends up as neutral points once the dust settles. But sometimes the center ends up being large, especially if it includes a side and a corner. This move is ok, since it threatens to separate the upper left corner from the other Blacks. Re: '*before* this point', you can cut at M8, then fix your O10 weakness by pushing at O8. Since those seem to maintain sente, you can then make this peep at D13.]
;B[cg];W[df];B[gc];W[hc];B[hb];W[he]SQ[gb][ib]C[MM: ?  When the opponent hands you nice forcing moves, you might as well use them. The cut at G18 then J18 looks natural.]
;B[ic];W[hd]SQ[mk][nj][oi]C[Again I end up making an empty triangle, but Black is left with weaknesses and I have friendly stones nearby to connect to if necessary. Any advice?

MM: You're in good shape. Black is going to lose a bunch of stones. Just watch out for your cutting points.]
;B[fc]C[MM: Seems wasted.];W[ed]C[MM: Not so good; invites Black to push at F16, or maybe even worse, to peep at F15. Just nail the coffin on the eyeless Blacks on the right, and you're home free.]
;B[de];W[ee]C[I'm spending a lot of moves securing the borders here, but the center is still wide open. If Black had invaded, I could have been left with little profit or maybe even without eyes. How or when could I have secured a base along the top, or a connection to the corner?

MM: Actually, it's not so easy for Black to successfully reduce your center much now. He has too many weak spots of his own. You can still connect to the upper right corner. The first step is M17; then you have to capture about 8 or 9 Black stones, but that is easy since Black has let you grow so strong.]
;B[lb];W[lc]SQ[rh][rf]C[MM: See? You will connect to the corner. Now sacrifice a stone at S12 so you can cut at S14.]
;B[kd];W[jc];B[ke];W[id]C[MM: ? Not necessary, Black can do nothing significant there. It's time to cut on the right.]
;B[ib];W[kg];B[kh];W[jh]SQ[lh]C[MM: Probably better at M12.]
;B[ki];W[ji];B[qf]C[MM: Oh well. Black managed to save some stones.]
;W[pf];B[ni];W[oi];B[ok];W[nj];B[mh]
(;W[ld]C[MM: Bad, because it induces Black N15. {see var.}]
;B[me];W[ne];B[oh]SQ[ph][nh]C[MM: You can sacrifice O12; just connect at Q12 (atari).]
;W[ng];B[ph];W[md]TR[ne][nf][ng][nh]C[I was afraid I wouldn't get a chance to play here. I think this move was a turning point of the game. Now Black's center stones are cut off without room for two eyes, if I can save my marked stones.]
;B[od];W[kf];B[og]LB[lf:A]TR[ne][nf][ng][nh]C[If Black had played at A, I think the marked white stones would have died.

MM: Yes, if Black connects, then he wins the race to capture.]
;W[lf];B[of];W[mg]C[I guess I could have connected one point higher. That would have saved my stones too, and would have avoided forming a meaningless ko, but at the time I didn't see that.

MM: Yes; you needlessly give Black a ko threat or a sente move at P15.]
;B[oe];W[lh];B[li];W[je]C[This move probably wasn't necessary.

MM: True; not necessary.];B[ll];W[ei]
(;B[dh];W[eh]C[I'm glad Black extended and didn't hane.

MM: The hane is unreasonable; White can cut Black's left side to ribbons {var.}.]
;B[nl];W[gk];B[fl];W[fk]C[Same here.];B[ej];W[fj]SQ[ek]C[I ended up making another empty triangle, and I've still got lots of cutting points. Fortunately, so does Black.

MM: I would extend to E9 here instead. Black has more to lose than White.]
;B[hk];W[hj];B[hl];W[gi]C[Defending my cutting point and my empty triangle.

MM: Probably not yet necessary. Until the outside liberties are filled, Black has no good follow-up to the inside attack. Better to push through at E9; for every stone you spend pushing through Black's border, Black will have to spend at least two or three stones sealing up. It's like free money -- too good a deal to pass up.]
;B[ek];W[bn]SQ[nr]C[At this point I should already have enough territory to win, but I need to secure my corners.

MM: Yes, White is ahead. O2 is bigger. But this is sente, so it's ok; you should still be able to be first at O2.]
;B[bm];W[en];B[em];W[do];B[fm];W[cn];B[dm];W[rm]C[MM: First O2, since this is likely to end in gote for you. By connecting your groups, you can spend fewer stones sealing your borders against Black.]
;B[rl];W[rn];B[nr]C[MM: Ouch; hurts White.];W[or]LB[ns:A][os:B]
TR[mq][mr]C[I didn't want to play at A because I thought Black would then play at B and seal off the watari. I guess it doesn't matter, since I have eyespace for the groups on both sides of Black's wall, but I was a little worried about the marked stones and wanted to connect underneath to help them.

MM: Usually it's better to connect than to have to spend moves ensuring that you have two eyes.]
;B[pp];W[qp];B[po];W[qn]C[MM: Now is when you should connect at O1. If Black gets to O1 before you, then you'll have to spend at least three or four stones sealing, connecting, and making eyes in the corner.]
;B[pm];W[ns]C[I got the watari I wanted. Oh well, maybe it's only worth a couple of points anyway.

MM: Probably the biggest thing on the board right now.];B[oq]
;W[pr];B[pj];W[mp];B[mk];W[mj];B[mo];W[no];B[op];W[oo]SQ[pn]
C[These two white stones are probably unnecessary, but it doesn't hurt to try.

MM: You failed to properly punish Black's empty triangle. Check out Q6 instead.]
;B[pn];W[lj]C[At the time, I was worried about Black playing here and cutting off my stones, but in hindsight I see that would have been auto-atari for Black's surrounded group. I was behind on the clock and ahead on territory, so I played the safe but unnecessary move here.

MM: That's prudent and proper.];B[lp];W[lq]C[Another empty triangle. Is there a better way to block this, or are some empty triangles inevitable?

MM: Some empty triangles are necessary. Once in a while, they're even good. This close to the edge and to your friendly stones, you won't be hurt much by this one. You could connect by playing L3 instead, but you lose a couple points that way.]
;B[kn];W[kp];B[kr];W[kq]C[MM: Unnecessary; Black needs at least two unanswered moves to do anything here.]
;B[am]C[MM: Should be A6];W[an];B[bo]C[MM: Pointless.];W[bp]
C[MM: Good, though D5 might leave one less ko threat for Black.]
;B[sm];W[cf]C[I ignored Black's previous move because the follow-up was small, and I saw Black's weakness here. I've had this same thing done to me before, so now I'm learning to push into my opponent's territory.

MM: Yes!];B[bf];W[bg];B[bh];W[ch];B[ag];W[ci]C[I saw that I could take two stones even if Black took the ko. I'm still very new at ko fighting, but this one went well.]
;B[dj];W[cj]SQ[be]C[MM: You might as well fill now; you've already done good work destroying about 10 Black points, by the time the borders are sealed. No need to risk that gain; simply connecting the ko is sente because of Black's cutting points like B15.]
;B[cg];W[dk];B[el];W[bg]C[I knew I couldn't kill Black's big group of stones here, but I could neutralize his wall and wipe out territory if I won the ko fight.]
;B[fd]C[MM: Not a potent threat. If Black F15, White F14; and Black has only reduced White a little. Meanwhile, Black's border still looks like a sieve. White should ignore this and connect the ko.]
;W[fe];B[cg];W[qe]C[This looks like a pretty good ko threat, but I'm still learning to spot them. If Black finishes the ko instead of responding here, I lose my four invading stones and Black secures the left side. Then I'd complete the ko threat by taking this atari, but I'd end up with my stones in a dumpling shape, no additional territory, and only two captured stones. I guess Black should have filled in the ko.

MM: Yes, Black should fill the ko. Note that Black has a good response to White's S14 capture.]

(;B[rf];W[bg];B[ko];W[cg]TR[in][jn]SQ[ec]C[I was more concerned with connecting my stones than with losing the two marked stones and a potential prisoner, so I completed the ko.

MM: Makes sense; but you still have threats, like at E17; so you can afford to save these.]
;B[jo];W[hq]TR[ip][jp][kp][mp][jq][kq][lq][mq][mr]C[I didn't want to risk losing my marked group because of a shortage of liberties.

MM: No danger here; you can connect on the right. But if you're not sure, then better to be safe like this than sorry.]
;B[fn];W[eo];B[bd];W[bi];B[ah];W[ai]C[These two moves by white weren't really necessary, but we were into byo-yomi time and I couldn't see the big moves right away. At least they were forcing moves that didn't hurt.]
;B[af];W[dd];B[cd];W[ec];B[db];W[eb]C[I think Black should have played here (E18), but I still would have attacked his cutting points.]
;B[ea];W[gb]C[akoni [25k?\]: thanks for the game.
fredb [24k?\]: Thanks.

If Black had played here (G18) he could have saved the three stones, but six stones on the second line isn't enough to make two eyes. He should still force me to kill them by playing G19 and then watari to connect to the corner with F19. I guess it doesn't matter, since I'm still leading by about 70 points.

I won this game, but I'd still really appreciate any pointers about mistakes I'm making and things I should work on or watch out for.

Thanks again,

-Fred

MM: Good game. For 24k, you've got an excellent grasp of things. With your good attitude, you will get stronger quickly.
   Advice: Watch out for cutting points. This would have been a different game if Black had attacked at O10 around move 45. Start looking for chances to sacrifice a stone or two -- snapbacks are a good first step. When you're deliberately sacrificing small groups to good purpose, you will have gained significantly. Practice reading life and death problems (http://www.goproblems.com/ is one good resource on the web; there are others). Play forcing moves first -- like at move 136, you lost the chance to push through Black's wall because you played a defensive move when you could have played an offensive one. Eventually, you'll want to study joseki -- they contain many useful tesuji -- but for the moment, you'll probably get more out of just playing serious games, and reviewing them.
You're well on your way. I have to reiterate, you're already doing quite well, and I expect that you'll get stronger quickly.  Best wishes, Mike Malveaux
