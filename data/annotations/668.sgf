(;B[fd]LB[cc:A]C[dada: in a way this move has its merits as it links to the stones on the right, but this makes it too easy for W
In an handicap game B should always try to keep W separated. Therefore a move at 'a' (c17) looks good - B can still run into the center afterwards. See variation.]

C[dada: good move.
Expands black top area and keeps an eye on W's left side. Good influence into center too.]
;W[dj]C[dada: a little bit too slow - right side is more urgent]
;B[pl]C[dada: good - the right side is the hottest spot];W[qk]
C[dada: this only helps B to make a solid wall];B[ql]C[dada: good]
;W[lq];B[mq]TR[ip]C[dada: note that this time the diagonal move is ok, as the marked stone (j4) is closer.]
;W[lo];B[rk];W[qj];B[pk]LB[cl:A][bj:B][bn:C][mf:D][rf:E][lr:F]
[fr:G][nn:H]C[dada: small move - alternatives are:  'a' ... expands your own territory and limits W territory (B can make the followup move at 'b' later on)
Compare B 'a' with a white move here and the possible followup of white at 'c' - huge difference.
'd' ... expands B's top territory
Other alternatives (not that big): 'e' (s14), 'f' (m2), 'g' (f2), 'h' (o6) - compare this one with your actual move]
;W[rj];B[sl]LB[rm:A][rl:B]C[dada: this leaves the peep at 'a' (s7) which makes it easy for W to invade the lower right corner. It's better to connect solidly at 'b' (s8).
Why is this important? Because if W plays at 'a' black has to answer at 'b'. That is, W can play a stone for "free" - and this one stone may be enough help for white to invade and live inside B's territory later on. The less weakness black leaves behind the less resources white has for an invasion.]

;W[jg];B[lc];W[kd]
(;B[he]TR[ka]LB[oj:A]C[dada: again too cautious - B need not be afraid of anything and should play one of the big moves instead (see comments on move #36). Playing around 'a' (p10) is a good move too (diminishes white's territory) - compare it with W's next move.

B doesn't need to fear anything, because the group is connected through the marked stone (l19) with the top right corner, which is alive. See variation.]
;W[nk];B[nl];W[oj];B[mn]LB[cl:A]C[dada: not that big - a move on the left at 'a' (c8) is much bigger.]

C[dada: of course B should capture the two white stones with a move at 'a' (m7)]
;W[lm]LB[lk:A]C[dada: and W should capture at 'a' (m9) instead]
;B[lk]C[dada: right now these two stones are not important. Cutting stones are only important if they keep a weak group apart from a strong group. Here the white groups on both sides are quite strong so these stones are worthless. Playing on the left is much bigger and more important.]

[bm:B][da:C]C[dada: B plays it safe which avoids all trouble. A good strategy in a handicap game.
But both black groups are already alive, so this connection isn't so important. Large endgame moves are: 'a' (f2), 'b' (b7), and 'c' (d19)]

;W[em];B[en];W[pj]C[At that point ... that seemed all

dada: overall a very good game for Black. B played safe and simplified the game whenever possible - a good strategy for high handicap games (5 or more stones). B emphasized defense and never had any weak groups which W could attack. However, sometimes B was too cautious which lost him points and made the game close.

I think the main points were the endgame and direction of play.
In the endgame B played many small moves - remember that plays at the edge are usually very large.
Direction of play means in which area to play next. B played the excellent move at q8 but didn't see the other large move on the left side which White played eventually.

Try to identify areas where both players can extend their territory. These areas are urgent and plays there are very big because you not only expand your own territory, but limit (or reduce) the opponents territory as well.

I recommend reading "In the Beginning" which is the first Volume of the Elementary Go Series from Kiseido. Another good book series is "Learn to Play Go" by Good Move Press. I suggest Volume 2 and 3.
