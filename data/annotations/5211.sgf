(;B[qh]C[ This isn't necessarily a bad move, but why do you want to immediately pincer? I often find that kyu players, including myself =( , can never stand to give their opponent territory and must fight everything.
 The chinese opening is a fast paced moyo opening and you should gather influence before you begin an attack.
 Please see the variations. They would be simple joseki with you gaining sente for a big point.]

;W[ph];B[dn]TR[qh][qi][qj][rl]C[Your triangle stones on the right exhibit a territorial desire. Your single stones along the top and left exhibit a influence/moyo desire.

 Do they seem contradictory? Would it be better if you were surrounding the white stones instead?

If I could easily do that I wouldn't be a 2kyu though. =p];W[fp]

Sure there was a kill, but you shouldn't think about that. That's a minor point in this review. Remember, you're ahead in territory, you only have to win by one.]

sleep667 [8k\]: gg
hush [8k\]: thx, nice game

well thats the game, thanks again for your help
ill be sure to pass on the kindness in my next review or teaching game

 Two general points:

A) Your first few moves were moyo oriented, but you didn't follow up. Its OK to play either, just be consistent. I prefer a territorial game.

B) Remember, you only have to win by 0.5. You can give your opponent SOME territory, and play steadier when you have the lead.
