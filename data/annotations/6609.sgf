C[Ken,

What happened in this game was that black killed a large group in the center gaining both points and immense power.  Although you made some life and death errors after that, I didn't see anything that would have turned the game around.  Black seemed quite single minded in keeping that group dead and taking advantage of the position.  I try and find some spots where the problem could be avoided and point out whatever else I can.]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[ep]C[This is the risk when, as white, your 3-4 point faces a black star point.  This is an ideal approach for black particularly if black is an influence or moyo type player.  My usual response to something like this is attach and extend, getting the corner and sente and trying to make up for it after. (see variation) It may be a bad idea!  I can't say I'm recommending it.  You may want to pincer and start a fight.  I think tenuki is also ok here but keep in mind black is building an outside position and do something about it soon.]

(;W[oc]C[Other than responding to E4, this is the biggest spot on the board, but it is playing black's game a little.]
;B[ld]
(;W[qc]C[I think this is wrong.  The idea of r17 is to settle in the corner.   If you settle in the corner and he gets influence facing his star point, you are still playing his game.  The high approach in the lower left is a signal of the kind of game he wants.  There are two usual responses to the high two space pincer and both emphasize white getting out.  White must get out.  See variations.]
;B[rc];W[pd];B[qb];W[pc];B[qe]
(;W[pb];B[pe]C[Black profited from the exchange of Q18 and Q15.  Q18 is an effort to settle and make life in the corner.  You need to get out and keep black separated.  It is too soon to seek safety.  This exchange is still playing black's game.  See variation for move 14.]

(;W[lc]C[This attachment winds up making M16 very strong.  Don't touch a weak stone.  Play at a distance and try to keep it weak or take the initiative.  I tried P15 but that is a lousy variation.  I am beginning to think ... tenuki.  See the other variations.  The gist of it is that I think white's corner can live or escape if black attacks.  Meanwhile you have to take the initiative in stopping black's build up of power on the right.  Black's occupation of Q15 makes an effective moyo game on the right and all of the variations are chancy for white.  The q15 group and the Q4 stone work well together.]
;B[kc];W[mc];B[kd];W[ne]C[Out!  Very good.];B[pj];W[qj]C[This is a difficult way to invade.  I'm sure exactly what to think of it.  Usually this kind of move starts a sacrifice or sabaki effort.  If it were me, I would invade more conventionally on the bottom right, perhaps 03, build a strong group and consider invading later.  Black profits, but we're playing a territory game then and I am on my comfortable ground (and, I suspect, yours).  A difficult invasion like this will typically trade reducing part of a moyo for securing or strengthening the rest of it.  You want to do it when you know that trade off is to your advantage.  Here, most of the board is still quite open.  This move, which turns out to be a success locally reducing 20 or more points, gives black a lot of outside power for the occupation of those open areas.]
;B[qk];W[qi]C[This worked out well and it may be the right move, but I'd point out that it is not "sabaki." You've invested more in the R10 stone and made a heavy group, which now has to live or escape or you suffer a big loss.  Sabaki would be a crosscut or hane here, expecting to lose some stones to get a flexible position to fight from.]
;B[pk]
(;W[pg]C[risky.  I'm not sure P12 wouldn't be better.  See variation.]
;B[of];W[pi];B[oi];W[oh];B[nh];W[ni];B[oj];W[ng];B[mh];W[og]
;B[mf]C[This move is another signal from black.  Black knows you will connect here (making your invasion locally a success as a reduction of black's potential territory.)  In addition to costing him territory and giving up an attack on your right side invasion force, he also knows he needs another move to secure his corner, so he's giving up sente.  He's doing this to secure a thick wall from L17 to R9.  He evidently likes thickness and likes the outside.  Of course, your next move is forced, so there's nothing to do about it now.  But it is an indication that your invasion, a local success, did keep the game progressing by his script.]
;W[nf];B[rg];W[rh];B[qg];W[oe];B[qh];W[ph];B[ri];W[rj];B[sh]
C[Black is alive and you have sente.];W[mg]C[Ok, his wall isn't that secure.  Correct push by you.]
;B[mi]C[A thick move by black.  He wants his position strong.]
;W[hd]C[I think I understand the idea here.  Threaten black's top group, stake a claim on some points, since you don't have any yet.  but I don't like H16.  G17 or F17 is more my style. (G17 is black's ideal point there.) Better claim on the corner, stronger position to move out from.  I'd also be tempted to play M13.  Black would play the ideal point at G17, but that's a territory move and I'd have sente to do something else.  Your move might be better than that.]
;B[kf]C[An interesting move by black.  It doesn't connect him by itself but it has some flexibility.  I'd push out from here.  See variation.]

(;W[rb]C[Wrong!  Your group is alive.  So is his even if he doesn't answer this.  This is a big endgame move.  You are not within endgame range of him if he secures the bottom and center.  You need to move down there or at M13 or somewhere else now!]
;B[sb]C[Wrong again! He doesn't need to answer you.  He should move at K4, if he wants to start harvesting points, or M13 if he wants more thickness.]
;W[qa]C[And wrong again.  This is a 5-10 point move.  Your groups are both safe.  Move down on the bottom.]
;B[dn]C[He figured it out first and played a big move. C4 is safe, but will probably be confined to the corner.

Look at the overall position here.  On the one hand, you have probably 15 points upper right, twenty points upper left, discounting for thinness and 5 points in the lower left, expandable to 10-15.  He has 10 points or less in the upper right and probably 10 safe points in the lower right and another 10 along his wall.  The bottom and lower right and center are still open and you can fight for them.  You have small nominal lead.  _But_  Look at what the stones you've both played are good for.  His group of 11 stones in the upper right have netted him 5-10 points (depending who plays at S16) and is wholly sealed in.  Your group of 20 stones up top have netted you about 15-20 points and have two small exit points.  Over the rest of the board, you have three thin scattered stones.  He has 16 stones over the rest of the board, two sealing you in lower left, a star point lower right, and a great wall with one small hole it in dominating the center, the bottom and the right.  Anything you throw in there is going to be at a severe disadvantage.  He semi-sacrificed the possibilities for his upper right group to build up power and now he is going to use it.  This is a terribly hard game for white now.]
;W[cn];B[cm];W[co];B[dm]C[Still his game.  I'd still have been tempted by E3.  That or give up the corner and invade the lower side now.]
;W[cj]C[this develops from the top left, but it is still thin.  Meanwhile it is close to the strong D7 stones.  It doesn't threaten them by the way.  The whole meaning of this move is to claim points in the upper left.]
;B[jp];W[jn]C[I don't think this is the right invasion.  Aside from being one move (or 20 moves) too late.  It is a high, reducing, capping move.  It needs to be able to get security from elsewhere, but it is deep, deep in black territory.  It has no access to the edge for making life.  I will still invade along the edge or in the corner and hope to come out of it with sente to reduce from some other spot.]
;B[lp];W[nj];B[mk]C[Loose ladder.  If the idea was a ladder breaker, black has you here.]
;W[rk]C[endgame.  You are 60 points behind now, being generous.  Yose doesn't help.  (in any case, T7 is better yose move.  Black can make a ko, but so far behind, you can't be afraid of kos.]
;B[qm];W[jk]C[Good.  You need a fast move here.];B[hk]C[Black correctly pushes you towards his thick wall and puts stones where they can limit your profits in the upper left.]
;W[lj]C[forcing move to move you along.  Good.];B[mj]
(;W[hj]C[Not sure this attachment is right];B[gj];W[hi];B[ik]
;W[jj];B[ij];W[ji];B[ii];W[jh]C[Wouldn't it be nice now if you'd moved to M13 instead of S18 or S9.]
;B[ih];W[jg];B[hc]
(;W[gc]C[No.  You cannot let the K9 group die and this exchange does that.  J14 is urgent.  Can't promise you'd escape and H17 does damage your top terribly, but you don't have a lot of choices now.  If not J14 that you need to concentrate on killing black's top side group, but I don't see how.]
;B[gb]
(;W[hb];B[ic];W[fb];B[gd];W[fc];B[ib];W[ga];B[he]C[Note his decision here.  He gave up some chance to reduce upper left to keep his group alive but also, more crucially, to make sure your center group died.]
;W[jf];B[jl]
(;W[gq];B[kl]C[I think black could have played e3 safely, but I can't fault his decision to keep your center group dead at all costs.  Haveing that group dead towers over the rest of the game, keeping you from profiting on the left or successfully invading and keeping him well ahead in points.]
;W[eq];B[ho]C[Your move was sound and profitable.  H5 again signals he wants to keep your center dead and win the won game.]
;W[dp]C[Not right.  C13 would be good timing.  h5 already tells you he's not that fussed about what happens in the lower left and you need more points and to make C10 useful.]
;B[cf]C[Trouble];W[ce]C[Playing form the wrong side.  Black can d14 so you cannot connect c10 to the corner.  Strong black stones all around.  Either you live or die in situ.]
;B[be];W[bd]C[You are making more strong black stones];B[de]
;W[bl]C[hurts corner but makes possible eye space];B[cd];W[cc]
;B[bm];W[bh];B[ej];W[dh];B[fh];W[eg];B[fg];W[ef];B[ed];W[dc]
;B[ee]C[Now you need to try to make two eyes.  E17 not meaningful.  Corner fine without it.]

(;W[ec];B[ff];W[bg];B[id]C[removing aji];W[lf];B[lg];W[me];B[ke]
C[no danger to black there];W[kg]C[not meaningful];B[lh];W[fp]
C[this is lightly profitable but not vital.  Because of B7, the left group is not safe.  You should move there and hope to bluff your way to life.  K2 is also a bigger reduction.]
;B[fn]C[black remains focused on the main event];W[go];B[gn]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[iq];B[jq];W[ir]C[All fine moves but not enough and the last few, prompting black's K3 and K2, make a corner invasion harder.]
;B[jr];W[qq];B[qp]
(;W[pq];B[or]C[An amazing move.  This sort of thing always trips me up too.  I think it works because, unlike the usual 3-3 invasion, white has absolutely no place to run and no outside help.  You can't kill p2 and you can't make an eye outside.  Maybe S4 will work (I'll try in a sec) but the real answer is the previous move.  It should be at q2, not q3.]

Ken,

The other guy was relentless about getting and keeping outside influence and thickness and banked huge profits from it through the middle game.  I can't say there was a single thing I would have done (or that I would have beat the guy myself) but you should be aware of the value of such outside positions and the benefits you or your opponent can gain from them.  Depressingly, the game seemed not to go well for you from the first few moves, which is harsh at 7k.  This can be a puzzling and difficult sort of game to play.  

Anyway, hope this has helped.
