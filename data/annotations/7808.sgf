C[--
Hello!  Thanks for rating my game.  I'm 5-6kyu on KGS.

I started playing again after a long break and it seems I've gotten worse. I don't know exactly what I'm doing wrong, but it seems I easily lose control of the game.  I have inlined comments.  Your help is appreciated! :-D

Long: A pleasure to have a chance to comment on your game~ 

I also play on KGS sometime, possibly seen you there!

Let's kick start. I prefer walk and talk, conclusion in the end.

So let's see what we have here...];B[cp];W[pp];B[dc];W[pd]C[--
Since I've been losing so much, I started playing more solid profit hoping I wouldn't be overwhelmed by the opponents territory.  I understand this may seem a bit conservative.

Long: It's all good as long as you play as yourself, in your style... I like to be solid too. The different between solid and conservative and patient is not clearly defined anyway. Just be yourself!]
;B[eq];W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[df];B[fc]C[--
Some say this is too low, but again I was trying to start out with some solid territory.

Long: Looks all right to me, but yes, some say it's slow for Black under current Komi... Since I think in this game you only have to give 0.5 point Komi, this is entirely acceptable. Call it a game even in 6.5 points Komi.]
;W[cj];B[qj]C[--
To prevent double wing.

Long: Sure thing. If B play C8, white Q10 and it's another game.]
;W[qg];B[qm];W[qo];B[oj];W[cm]C[--
Looking for the oba here.  O3 seemed natural but I'm sure there is a better one.

Long: O3 looks alright, at least not too bad.];B[nq];W[pm];B[pl]
C[Long: can also consider to extend solidly at R8, if you do not want O3 be under more pressure.]
;W[om]
(;B[pr]C[Long: I'd prefer extend back at L3 (or K/L4?) if not playing R6, since W's corner is not secure anyway, and Q7and P7 add some influence to W.]
;W[lq]
(;B[no]C[--
Is this the wrong way to escape?

Long: I'd enter R3 and live right the way. Or try P5.];W[qn]
;B[rm];W[qq]C[Long: Now it's clear that P5 is better than O5.]
;B[qr];W[rr]C[--
I saw the variation rooted from this move where I could have destroyed his base but I thought it put a little too much preasure on my Q2 group.

Long: Now Q2 group get's heavy.]
(;B[kp]C[Long: If you are going to play L4, leave R2. If you want to play R2...]
;W[kq];B[lp]C[Long: It's a real pain that B cannot play K4. W is so happy, and the weakness around N3 is more clear...]
;W[jp]
(;B[iq]C[Long: Pardon me... B is not wrong, but you must know the risk before you play this move.]
(;W[jq];B[jo];W[io];B[jn]
(;W[or]C[Long: W made a mistake here... B's chance.]
(;B[oq];W[mq]C[Long: N3 is the crucial point.];B[mp];W[nr];B[pq]
(;W[hq]
(;B[in];W[rp]C[--
This is what has been happening to me lately, unsuccessfuly building moyo.  Could you provide me with a better variation?

Long: Lots... But after all, the last mistake is J6.];B[ip]
(;W[ir]C[Long: ?];B[hp];W[gp];B[ho];W[gq]C[Long: B is much thicker.]
(;B[eo]C[Long: Unnecessary.];W[rn]TR[cj][cm][om][pm]C[Long: Now let's do a briefing...

W's corner is secure and made some points in the lower side.
B is thick, but it's influence is reduced by the marked stones... Not sure how many points it can make.
If W can get P8, this thickness may end up in nothing.];B[nc]
C[--
Another oba that looked natural to me but I am not sure if it's the right one.

Long: It's correct, and probably the largest place on the board.
Q17 is considerable too.];W[oc];B[nd];W[ob]
(;B[nb];W[jd]C[--
I thought he may have been a bit foolish to do this so I try to punish him.  Was that the wrong state of mind?

Long: This play is very aggressive.];B[pe];W[qe];B[od];W[qc]
;B[pf];W[qf];B[ic];W[jc];B[id]
(;W[ie]C[Long: W's overplay.];B[je]C[Long: Good! B is so thick and should love a fight.]
;W[ld]
(;B[jf]C[Long: see variations.];W[lf]
(;B[nf];W[kg];B[if];W[oh]C[Since I'm 5-6kyu I play against people that make moves like this.  I feel that these chaotic (is it chaotic?) moves make me lose quite often.

Long: Your cut at K15 is wonderful, but the next best move was missed.
At this point, you have 2 objectives:
1. secure your group
2. Using the influence to attack W's group.

W's move of P12 is aiming at your first objective, and see if there is a chance to secure his group while attacking you.]
;B[ph];W[pg]
(;B[og]C[--
This was a horrible mistake due to misreading.  I would have played the previous move's variation if I saw it correctly.]
;W[of]

(;B[mh];W[mf];B[of];W[pi];B[ni];W[qh]C[--
Now I find myself struggling to live.  Is this where I lost the game or were there other problems up until now?

Long: The game is over at this point.];B[lc];W[kd];B[kb];W[jb]
;B[md];W[me];B[mb];W[ki];B[oi];W[ih];B[ph]C[--
I realize this is a mistake, it is small.

Long: Yes, of course you should takeJ15.]
(;W[gg]C[Long: I'd play H15.];B[he];W[dh]C[Long: W plays conservatively now. He is ahead.]

Here is where things get ugly and white starts to push me around.  Could you please help me exploit the loose connection of his M14 group to better use the little moyo I have?
