C[Hi there Kevin!

I'm Pyry Kovanen from Finland, aka Hyrveli on KGS, and I'm going to review this game of yours. I'm currently ranked 8 kyu on the forementioned server.

I'll be focusing my criticism mainly on White this game, but while I may sound harsh at times, I only want to help you improve.

Why did White lose this game?

In my opinion, White lost because he got an inferior opening position. Black was spread out all across the board but White was cramped in one corner. This opening advantage got nullified as the game progressed, and White actually could have won the game (see the final variation), but only because Black blundered away a significant group at the end.

White also suffered from a common beginner problem; following the opponent around. Always think about if the opponent's move is really worth answering, when there are big moves left to be played on the board.]
;B[pd]C[Every move is important, even the first one. 

When a player chooses to play on the 4-4 point, he is aiming for flexibility. A common beginner mistake is to think that a play at the star point secures some corner territory. The 4-4 point does not secure any corner territory at all, but if the opponent invades the corner, the defender always gets more than sufficient compensation. The main power of the 4-4 point is flexibility and influence. Always keep this in mind when developing from the star point.]
;W[dd]C[Steveniv [17k\]: hi];B[cc]CR[ib][ic][id][ie][bh][ch]
[dh][eh]C[If I were White in this position, I'd pretty much cheer with joy. This move by Black is blatently bad and White is sure to get a better result from the inevitable sequence, even though Black gets a fairly substantial amount of corner territory. Don't be fooled, though, since the wall White gets is much more valuable.

The 3-3 point invasion is not always bad, though. In situations where the White wall would be ineffective, such as when there would be Black stones around the marked points, it becomes a very powerful move indeed.

Instead of Black 3, normal continuation would be to play around one of the empty corners.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg]
(;B[dp]C[Black breaks off the standard joseki which is shown in the variation. It isn't the best of moves, but he gets potential in yet another corner.]
;W[cb]C[This is a decent move locally, but a bad move globally. See the variation for why this is.]

(;B[bb];W[eb]C[The Black corner is diminished, but the sequence is gote (gote means that you lose the initiative, sente means you have the initiative) for White and the corner is alive.]

(;B[bg]C[Luckily Black makes a terrible move. Crawling on the second line is never good, especially since Black is already alive and pushing from behind in this position.

See the variation for a devastating continuation.];W[bh]C[This is a completely unnecessary move. White does not threathen to kill Black in any way, so even now Black should ignore the small White move and play in the remaining open corner. A better move for White would also have been to play at the corner, and the resulting position would be superior to White.]
;B[ad]C[This is also not needed at all, Black merely took a point away from himself and allows White the chance to play at the remaining corner.]
;W[ag]C[Reading is fundamental to successful Go play. One should get familiar with reading by first reading out short, simple sequences. When you play a move, always try to think of the obvious reply to that move, then the obvious reply to that one and so on. This position is a good, simple reading exercise. Is White 18 a good move?]
;B[af]CR[ae]C[This is, of course, the obvious reply. It is not the best one, however, since the corner is still up for grabs and this move only makes one point (the marked one). However, it invites White to save his single stone that is in atari with dire consequences.]

(;W[ah]TR[ch]C[See the variations for better alternatives.

This is a mistake with grave consequences. White saves a stone, yes, but look at the marked cutting point.]
;B[ch]TR[de]C[Uh oh!

Black cuts decisively and suddenly White is in a world of trouble. The three stones will have to be sacrificed or resort to a horrible life on the second line, and the marked cutting point will be a significant threat later on.

Nonetheless, White should sacrifice three stones in this position. In Go small battles like this don't mean anything, and often the one who wins many small battles loses the war.]

(;W[ci]C[This move saves the endangered white stones, but at a terrible cost.]
;B[dh]LB[de:A]C[After this move Black can either decimate White's wall (by cutting at A) or take the remaining corner, both equally devastating for White's winning chances.]
;W[bi];B[pp];W[de]C[Things are starting to look grim. From a whole-board perspective White is really going to have a tough time getting anything going since Black is nicely spread out and White has only played in one corner of the board.]
;B[ei]C[This move is not needed, the two black stones can't be killed anyway.]
;W[cl]C[White secure life for his clunky group, but with very few points of territory.]
;B[cn]C[A fairly good move from Black, blocking White from advancing to the bottom left hand corner.]
;W[jd]LB[ik:A]C[A good move!

White makes an ideal extension from his powerful wall, and if he can later play around A he makes a nice framework with huge potential territory in the center.]
;B[kc]C[This kind of play is jokingly called an armpit-hit (see http://senseis.xmp.net/?ArmpitHit). It is almost always a bad play, as it is in this position. It does nothing but to strengthen the lone white stone.]

(;W[kd]C[This is the wrong way to extend in this position, for reasons which are explained in the variation.]
;B[lc];W[ld];B[qj]C[Good move from Black.

Sides should always be second in priority to the corners.];W[nd]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[nb]C[Bad move, see the variations for punishment.]

(;W[mq]LB[np:B][nq:A]C[I have mixed feelings about this move. It fails to capitalize on the mistake of Black 39, it is quite an odd way to approach a 4-4 stone (more common is A or B) and it is slightly isolated from the other white stones. On the other hand, it is a good attack on the last empty side of the board. I'd have played something else, though.]
;B[iq]C[I like this move a lot, since Black makes some territory while simultaneously pincering the lone white stone.]
;W[pq]C[This is a move I don't like. As a rule of thumb contact plays are not good, since they only serve to strenghten the other stone. I feel that is especially true in this case.]
;B[oq]C[The correct response. White may have enough to live in the corner, but it will be very small and the outside influence for Black will definitely be more valuable.]
;W[op]C[This is an interesting move. It showcases some nice fighting spirit, and disregards the corner which is absolutely correct.]
;B[or];W[np];B[qp];W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[jq]LB[gp:A]C[This is bad. First of all, it is a contact play, which are seldom any good, and secondly it makes an invasion around A impossible.]
;B[hp]LB[jp:A]C[Quite a passive response from Black. A play at A would have been more suitable.]
;W[jo];B[mm]C[It might be that Black is overextending himself with such a daring move, but I nonetheless like it. It reduces the potential White territory by a huge amount if it lives.]

(;W[oo]C[This is not a good move. It lets Black reinforce his lone invader and makes awful shape. Always think twice when making a move that creates two empty triangles in one move. See the variations for better alternatives.]
;B[jf]C[A poor move from Black. He could have capitalized on White's complete disregard for his invasion and even started an attack on the lower White group, but instead he plays extremely close to the White wall at the top. This move must be punished.]

(;W[pg]C[This might be a decent move under different circumstances, but White really should focus his efforts on killing the Black stones in the center in a position like this. It will obviously not be trivial, but the enormous strength of the walls of White should prove to be fatal. See variation.]
;B[qf];W[qg];B[rg];W[pf];B[pe];W[qe];B[qd];W[rf];B[rh];W[of]
C[This move is quite small. I'd still go for one of the moves mentioned previously to try to grab the center.]
;B[re];W[oe]C[It's good that White didn't fill the eye, but this move is even smaller. It's value is only one point. On the plus side, it builds nice influence on yet another side of the board.]
;B[qf];W[bn];B[sf]
(;W[bo]C[Don't play so small. The moves in the variations are worth more points.]
;B[bq];W[co];B[dn];W[im];B[ik];W[eg];B[fh];W[eh]LB[hh:A][el:B]
C[White should still be able to kill all the black stones in the middle. This would be accomplished by destroying the black eyespace by playing close to A. Black might still escape from B, but not all that easily.]
;B[di];W[fg];B[gh];W[gg];B[hg];W[hf];B[if]C[White seems to have accepted that Black will live in the center, and his moves so far have only helped Black. A more aggressive approach would have been better.]
;W[hh];B[ig];W[hi];B[gj];W[he];B[ji];W[oj]C[A good move!

This move by White threathens the lone invader and additionally helps efforts to connect the White groups at the top and bottom. It also makes sure that Black can't invade the center any longer.]
;B[oh];W[md]LB[ph:A]C[Black does not threathen to cut the groups in any way, so this move is not necessary.

Better would have been something like A.];B[nh];W[ol];B[nj]

Black has pretty much kept the initiative for the entire endgame, but finally White takes the reins.]

(;W[ks]C[In go, one should always play the move that gains most points. This particular moove is very small, only worth one point, and must therefore be played later. Even though White threathens to capture the two black stones, there are far bigger moves available for White. See variations.]
;B[ir];W[js]C[This move is bad for two reasons.

1) It is only worth 1 point.

2) It is gote. This means that after Black plays the inevitable move, White must respond to save the two stones and therefore loses initiative. Always play sente moves before gote moves.]

;B[kg];W[ng];B[mc]C[This is a decisive move for Black. White can no longer kill the black group and Black gets some nice territory on the top side.]

;B[ke];W[le];B[lg];W[ca];B[es];W[hs]C[White shouldn't be fooled by Black's previous move. Now, he just tosses away an additional point, even though the black group had no escape whatsoever.]
