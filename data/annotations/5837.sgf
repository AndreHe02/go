C[Hi dear reviewer...
I m a beginner and i try to find a way to ply better go...
This game started not bad for me i think,
I played not bad(black) and tried to win the center,my opponent did some mistakes ,but me too.I lost with 30 points...dont know where...:(

Thank you for your help


mgelo:
I will do my best. Currently I'm 5k on KGS

General impressions:
   * you seem to have decent fighting skills, now you need to achieve better positional judgement. (That said, still a few reading mistakes. I recommend going over the games you played and find tactical errors.)
Also, watch for cutting points in your position.

   * as  many beginners, you struggle with recognizing which moves are urgent, and which are not. Both players in this game made several moves that are very small. These mistakes are generally the most costly, when you let your opponent take the next big point!
 (the most glaring mistakes were moves 105 and 159; but don't be too embarrassed, your opponent made them too!) 

Play strong!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc]

 (the marked Black stones have a weakness at A)];W[oc]C[this is a "thank-you" move from your opponent. It makes you stronger without any real gain for White.]
;B[pc];W[ob]TR[oc][nc][fq]C[another bad move. The resulting shape, empty tirangle, is a proverbial bad shape in Go!]

;W[qm];B[sm];W[sn];B[qk]C[even though White lived, he is sealed inside, and overall situation is good for Black.]
;W[pm]C[White gets out at any cost. I don't think it's worth the sente. Black has now a very good option of extending below]

(;B[mp]C[there's no need even to respond];W[lq]TR[mp]C[the marked exchange is very good for White: he has the makings of the wall on the left!]
;B[mr]LB[lo:A]C[but this is very small. Since your  corner is connected to O8 group, it is very secure. 

A is the critical point here: however takes it first, has advantage locally]
;W[lr];B[sq]C[this move should only be played very late in the game!]
;W[mo];B[lo]C[Good. Now you see why it is the critical point?]

(;B[jn];W[mo];B[lm];W[lo];B[ho]SQ[in]C[this could be an overplay. Simply extending (J6) is good enough.]

 yes even though you might have gotten even better result (See var. on move 73) 

 Your goal is now take care of P11 group/ your weak group R10. 
The places where two weak groups meet are the most urgent!

Also, the cutting points reduce the effectiveness of your wall

Another interesting plan is to attack near D6];B[gq];W[js]C[seems unnecessary, more good news for you]
;B[gr]C[I'm not so sure about this one. 
You still have a lot of cutting points: I feel F4 is better in this area, and play around R12, globally!]

a mistake by W];W[eq];B[gn];W[fq]C[wasted move];B[gp]C[totally unnecessary!]
;W[cl]
(;B[dm]C[Black's wall is very strong, it hardly needs any defense. 

They key to using the wall, try to play elsewhere, and drive your opponent into the wall!]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[dj];B[ej];W[ei]SQ[oi][oj][di]C[this is very painful for Black. Black has gotten a step "behind" White and is paying the price.

Note that the marked stones hinder your development in the center, and it's hard for you to attack them because your group at R10 is unsettled]

  B:  15  LR

        60 center


 W  85 top and left
      10 lower and right
      25 left

 So, W seems to be ahead. However, White does not necessarily get all the top, so you need to invade there.]
