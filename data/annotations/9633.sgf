C[Dear reviewer,thank you for your time.
This was an offline game,my opponent level is around 5d

The game was quite close till the endgame but I managed to mess up(I was white)

Please point out my mistakes :)

(;W[jh];B[el];W[qj]C[FM: well, the game is quite over with this. Black begun with a very bad fuseki - the upper side was a disaster for him. Then the outcome was reversed as white messed up the left side a bit and then let black to strenghten in the center first and was giving points away while battling on several occasions (most obvious was the ko fight, also the F14 beginning of an attack is remarkable). During every fight it is important to stop now and then and look for profit. Many times taking profit, letting your opponent connect on neutral points and then having sente for occupying another big place on the board is just what is possible.]

(;W[np];B[oq];W[nn];B[ml]LB[lh:A]TR[kg][ng]C[FM: this is blacks aim here. Black is building up defense against A and is slowly thinking about building territory in the center.
