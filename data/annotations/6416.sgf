C[First, thanks for looking at my game. I played this game on KGS and I was black. As far as my own perception of my abilities, I feel like my fuseki and openings tend to be fairly weak - it seems like I win most games by killing something big. The beginning of the game is definitely where I feel the most lost, so any and all pointers on jyouban would be very welcome. Otherwise, I thought I played fairly well (I could be wrong), although some of my readings were off. Thanks.

Hope you enjoy the review

Yes, but already difficult for you.
Overall I think you played better than White in this game, but your technique let you down at times. I think your whole board vision was better though.]
