C[[Me\]:I'm a very beginner so I still plat in 9x9 and I use territory score. I play against the program Fuego.

[Raffael\]: Hey Renan!

So, let's review your game. Considering you've just been playing for a week, you're very good already!

It's a bit harder to give beginner's advice on smaller boards because close space fights are one of the more advanced topics in my opinion but I'll do my best :)]
;B[cc];W[gf];B[dh]LB[dg:A][cg:B][cf:a]C[[Raffael\]:

This move isn't to bad per se but I think it's not ambigious enough and too close to the lower border.

You could play at A or, if you wan't to be more secure, B. This will give you more influence toward the middle, possibly more territory and it will make it much harder for white to place a stone between the two of your stones. Like it is now, white could e.g. play at C and would have space to move in any (opposite) direction if you try to block him from any side.

But it's very good that you start by securing corners.];W[ef]

[fi][gi][hi][ii]C[[Me\]:Here, I tried to protect the lower area with 5.

[Raffael\]: A good move in this situation. You had to protect the corner because it's very valuable to you. If you would have playd closer and made contact (A), white would havehad enough space to be able to put a stone in your corner and cause you a lot of trouble.



Let's analyze the situation  bit further: You control the left side but that's not enough territory to win the game. There are two areas not owned by anyone yet (marked by me with crosses). If you want to win the game you have to try to take at least one of those territories.]
;W[ec]C[[Raffael\]: Now, white is trying to take A LOT of territory... we can't let that happen and are forced to react ;)]
(;B[eb]C[[Me\]:I tried to defend the upper left area and attack the invander. Was it unnecessary?



[Raffael\]:This move is a classical mistake which you won't do anymore in a very shot time. No worries, I did it too. But like you can see in the next few moves, white can easely isolate your stone and kill it.



But to answer your question: It was unnecessary AT THIS MOMENT. There are times when it's very important to defend your corner. But while your upper corner is already relatively secure (you can always connect to the lower stones if the need should arise), it is VERY important to gain some territory, like i wrote at the move just before this one. Even if you could hold the stone you just placed, you then give white a chance to secure the upper left (which is a very big part of the field) or the lower left with his next move. Thus, you give white "sente" and yourself "gote". "Sente" can roughly bee translated as "preceeding move" and means you have the initiative or so to speak: You make a move you want and the other player is forced to answer to your move. "Gote" is the opposite: The other player can play wherever he wants, e.g. attacking you and you have no choice but to react to his move; e.g. block his attack.]
;W[db];B[dc]C[[Me\]:9 in D7 do 7 be alone to die. F7 is better?]
;W[fb];B[ed]C[[Me\]:11 tries to save 7.];W[fc];B[de]LB[fd:a]
[gd:b]C[[Me\]:I gave up 7 and try to attack 4 and protect 11

[Raffael\]: A might be better because white will have to block you at B to not allow you to invade the upper left corner and causing him a lot of lost territory. Then you could still make your original move at D5 or try to attack the lower right.

It's good you gave up on 7, it's lost anyway.];W[dg];B[df]LB[ef:a]
[dg:b][eg:c][cg:d][fg:e]MA[fe][fd]C[[Me\]:15 try to help 15 putting two white stones in trouble.

[Raffael\]: This move does achieve to little. The stone marked as A stell has 3 free spaces. B might be in trouble if you play a stone at C. But it's white's turn now and if he plays at D, you are in a great lot of trouble, will have to defend your corner and most probably lose big parts of it. There will be no time to play at C for you. And even if you can hold the corner white will end up  with probably 2/3 of the board.

You could play at the two crosses I set to force white to react and drive him back a bit or play at E to try to take part of the lower side of the board. I won't play it through because there are a lot of possibilities of how it will play out but you'd definately gain some points by doing this.]
;W[fd];B[eg]LB[fg:a]C[[Me\]:17 reinforce the 15's attack.

[Raffael\]: Indeed not a bad move but A would have been better (see my explanations two moves earlier. There it's "E").

You just have to try to win some more territory at this moment or you'll lose because white already has more (more or less) secure territory.]
;W[fg];B[cg];W[gh];B[fi]C[[Me\]:21 tries to ensure the lower territory.]
;W[fe];B[gi];W[hh];B[fh];W[cb];B[ab]LB[bb:a][ca:b][eb:c][ee:d]
[ef:e][fg:f][ff:g]TR[db][cb]C[[Me\]:I put 27 to prevent white from took upper left

[Raffael\]: You can absolutely play at A. That would leave you with more territory and if white doesn't react, you'll be able to set the two marked stones atari by playing at B and then white would have to react and beat C. It's always good to have the initiative!

Likewise, playing at D would put E at danger (and if you beat it also F) and force white to play at G.]
;W[hd];B[bb]C[[Me\]:I'm trying to kill this two white stones

[Raffael\]: Good idea! Like I'd mentioned two moves ago, this would have been an even better move when it was your last turn. But you'l learn those things through experience, trust me :)]
;W[ca];B[ba];W[ea];B[dd]LB[ee:a][ef:b]C[[Me\]:connect and fortify the center

[Raffael\]: I'd connect at A, putting B in danger, thuss forcing white to react. Also, this would gain you more territory.

That's it. There's nothing more to say on this game, I think. Feel free to contat me if you should have any questions.]
;W[ee];B[hi]C[[Me\]:stole 1 territory from white];W[ih];B[tt]
C[[Me\]:I passed because there is nothing more to do.];W[ii]
;B[tt]C[[Me\]:I passed because there is nothing more to do.]
;W[tt])
(;B[gc]C[[Raffael\]: With this move, white would have to block you from one side...]
(;W[gd]C[[Raffael\]: If white blocks you here, you shouldn't have to set up a territory in the corner. The following moves are just an example of how it may play out and surely are not the very best moves possible (I'm not that good myself) but they serve as an example.]
;B[fb];W[eb];B[hb];W[fc];B[hd]TR[gd]LB[gb:a][hc:b][ga:c][ic:d]
C[[Raffael\]: Now you ended up with another corner more or less secured and white still has not a single corner secured  which is a very bad thing for white. Also, if white doesn't pay attention you may set the marked stone atari (a stone or group of stones with just one free space which thus can be captured with only one stone). the sequence folowing this could also cause him a lot of trouble.

If white tries to play at either A or B you can capture him imediatley with a stone at C or D]
)
(;W[gb]C[[Raffael\]: It will be harder to defend if white plays here but I think it can be done. As with the other alternative, this will just be an example of what could happen]
;B[hb]TR[gb]LB[fb:a]C[[Raffael\]: The marked stone could now be beaten very easely if you play at A, so, white will have to do something]
;W[fb]C[[Raffael\]: Now it's gonna get complicated...];B[fc]
LB[eb:a]TR[fb][gb]MA[eb]C[[Raffael\]: With this move you threaten white to beat the two marked stones if white doesnt play at A]
;W[eb]
(;B[ge]C[[Raffael\]: This could be a follow up move where you just try to establish a living group in the right.]
)
(;B[ed]TR[ec][eb][fb][gb]C[[Raffael\]: This could be another one where you threat to kill the marked stones which are by no means secure. If you'd suceed in that you wouhld have a very good chance to also get some territory on the right. As you can see, there are a lot of possibilities how this could work out]
)))
(;B[fg]MA[ca][cb][ba][aa][ab][bb][bc][ac]C[[Raffael\]: You can also play here which is worth more than the little space you might lose in the upper corner. The important space in the upper corner (in this situation, mind you!) are the marked fields and that you can maintain a connection to the lower corner. But they're not in danger yet so you don't have to defend them right now.

This move is less ambigious than to try to attacke the upper right but also easier to successfully execute.]
