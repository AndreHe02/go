C[Human strength is 5 Kyu.  Computer playing at level 5 Here I played white. And no matter what the macnie says I am nowhere near 5k, more like 25k.]

;B[cg];W[ee]C[I did not find this move very useful. What we are looking for is something that will block B from entering into our territory and will do this with one move (hopefully)]

(;W[ch]C[This was stupid. Usually here I play D3.];B[dh]C[I analyzed D3 too much.

Definitely it was a better move for White.];W[eg]
(;B[de]C[Would definitely play the jump into W territory and W would lose the game after this.
This Black defense is very small. let's see what W could have done.]

Actually looking at the differences now, still jump into W territory is bigger...


The conclusion of all this is , the biggest move is blocking that F8 .]

Now let's look at some possibilities :]

here W can penetrate into Blacks are and seperate him.];W[cf]

I thought the stone you played would this Black response and that would force to play "this" defensive move.

After that Black has sente and could play E8 as shown.];B[eb]
