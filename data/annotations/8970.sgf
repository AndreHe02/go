;B[qd];W[dp];B[po];W[dd];B[oc]C[recently use this fuseki pretty often. I know it's weaknesses, but still like it.]
;W[pq];B[np];W[nq];B[mq];W[mp];B[no];W[nr];B[lq]C[reid: fighting joseki]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[mo];B[ko];W[mn];B[jp];W[nn];B[pp];W[qq];B[pm]
;W[hq];B[lm]C[reid: Black M3 chose the fighting variation - we end up with two weak groups.  White H3 focusses on keeping the black M3 group eyeless.  Black M7 has a weakness: it can be cut from L5 quite easily.  Black might prefer to play L7 instead of M7 so as to maintain the strength of his fighting group. A basic principle of any kind of fight is that stronger fighters do better than weaker fighters.]
;W[nl];B[ok];W[nk];B[oj];W[lk]C[local fight over. I like this result for B

reid: Hmm, I'm not sure I agree that the local fight is over.  Neither of these groups has two eyes yet.  White has better access to the center, and because M7 can be cut off, it seems like white has a stronger fighting position.

Black seems to have a large moyo on the right, but it is still very vulnerable.  Fifth-line territory (P10) is difficult to hold on to, the upper right corner has known invasion points, and S5 is large yose sente for white.]
;B[fc]C[reid: I think black would be better off reinforcing his L5 group somehow.  If he can protect the M7 cut, white is eyeless again.]
;W[hc];B[fe];W[df];B[id]C[aiming wall (see variation)]
(;W[rd]LB[ic:E][qc:B][rc:D][qe:A][re:C]C[C and D not an option for me here. Was thinking about tenuki E, but corner is big. I think A is best, but B is stylish)

reid:  A go players job is to make his opponent's life miserable :-)  White knows that if he plays E, black will use the wall against his center group (M9), so he tries a different plan.]
;B[qe];W[qc]LB[pc:A][re:B]C[not sure wich is better here

reid: White seems to have a lot of options on the upper side.  He can put H17 into motion, or he can sacrifice it and try to invade deeper, or he can just move in from his center group to reduce the top.  This seems to hint that B is more important than A since white has fewer options on the right side.]
;B[pc];W[mi]C[good point for W, but i feel i'm ahead now

reid: I think if I were white, I'd continue with S15.  The center white group is not in immediate danger because it is stronger than black's L5 stones.  If white can destroy the right-side territory, I think he will be in good shape.]
;B[db]LB[cc:B][ec:C][ic:A]C[to make A and B miai. Though A directly not good, since W have C forcing. But now i like A too]
;W[kn]C[reid: White already played N11 to make his center stones stronger.  L6 therefore must be meant to attack the black center stones.  I think something like H5 or J5 would be a better attacking move.]
;B[jn];W[km];B[jm];W[jl];B[il]C[reid: white has helped black.  White's center territory is only a little more than two eyes.  In general, you would like to get either two eyes, or a lot more than two eyes.  Getting three eyes is only one point better than getting two eyes.]
;W[jk]LB[hm:A][hp:B]TR[hq]C[What shape is best here? A or B my options.

reid: B helps white settle the bottom left corner territory.  A or perhaps H6 is better.]
;B[hm];W[lo];B[kq]C[reid: The white center group is alive, but the black center group is in much better shape now too.  White N11 is not in a very good spot, and black can think about invading the lower left corner.  Not a great result for white here.

I'd say this is the point where black took the lead.];W[io]
;B[jo];W[go]LB[cc:A][ic:B][re:C][dh:D][cn:E]SQ[il][hm][jm][jn]
[jo][jp]C[B's marked group looks pretty safe now. So i got sente. But here is alot of big moves. Not sure which is the biggest.

reid: I like to ask three simple questions:  Where can he attack me?  Where can I attack him? Where is the territory?

Answer all three, in that order, and you should have the answer of where to play next.

1: White can attack Black with B, but it's not huge since black could give up the J16 stone (the white center is very strong)

2: Black can attack white at B but not huge (same arguments as above) and at C.  D is sort of an attack, but black can't really expect to kill anything.

3: The biggest chunk of territory that has been mapped out so far is the right side.

Since question 1 seems not very relevant in this position, and C comes up in both question 2 and 3, I would play at C.]
;B[cc]LB[hd:B][dh:A]C[so i choose this one to make A more severe and B aji become smaller

reid: Earlier, you played D18 to make C17 and J17 miai.  If they are indeed miai, you don't need to play either.]
;W[fb];B[eb]LB[ec:A]C[here maybe A better?

reid: Yeah, looks like.];W[ic];B[jd]C[reid: This looks like a problem.  White now has a strong center group, so this black wall will have no use.  White is gaining territory for free.  Black would be better off sacrificing J16.]
;W[jc];B[kd];W[lc];B[dh]C[reid: This group is difficult to attack effectively - the stones are high, easy to run, and white has a strong center group.]
;W[ff];B[gf];W[fg];B[ee];W[dg];B[eh]C[reid: Black peeps at the bamboo joint here.   Maybe dropping down with C12 would be better, but no matter what, black has a difficult time threatening this running group.]
;W[cd];B[gb];W[ld]LB[cn:A][bo:B][cq:C]C[here i want to play A,but decided W would answer B. And side would be smaller than a corner. So play C to make W overconcentrated]
;B[cq]C[reid: Black has a lot of irons in the fire at this point.  The K6 group is not entirely settled, although it is not really a target right now, The D12 stones are plastered right next to a strong bamboo joint, and the K16 formation does not look very useful or strong.

At the end of this game, black ended up with four distinct groups on the left side of the board, with a total of 15 points between the four groups - less than four points per group.  To make your stones effective and efficient, they need to work together, not as a collection of different groups.

White might answer C6 with B5, but the black stones would be working together (and there is still a lot of aji in the white corner).]

;W[er];B[eq];W[fq];B[dr];W[fr];B[bs];W[gm];B[fo]C[maybe mistake]

;B[gi];W[hi];B[jj];W[gj];B[kl]C[B alive without this. So it's useless exchange. Or B should fix here shape somehow?

reid: not completely useless: it makes white choose a direction and clarifies the situation.  White spends a move to take this stone in a couple of moves anyway.]
;W[kk];B[cj];W[ll];B[hn];W[hf];B[hd];W[re];B[rf];W[qb];B[se]
;W[sc];B[rp]LB[qf:A]C[cut A looks very painfull. Maybe i should defend it right now? Want to play sente before connect

reid: Since white can connect with N1 or L1, S4 is not really sente.  White answers - perhaps he feels that he is ahead now?  If he thinks he's behind, he could try the cut at A instead of answering.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[rq];B[kc];W[kb];B[jb];W[mb];B[ka];W[lb];B[of]
;W[ib]LB[ia:B][gd:A]C[was pretty happy here and thought i'm winning pretty easy. I know about cut A, but ko with B too large for W. So i thought W would not go for it. And decided to play it safe

reid: If you're counting on the ko, then perhaps R14 is better (than P14) to minimize ko threats.]
;B[nh]C["i have won this game" move. Maybe too slow and passive?

reid: Yeah, I think so.  Perhaps better to patch up the cut with G17.  Now the ko becomes flower-viewing for you.]
;W[gd];B[ge];W[gc];B[fd];W[he];B[ia];W[ja];B[if]LB[hg:A]C[threat in A instead? or something else?

reid: A leads to more internal ko threats, so yes.];W[hg];B[jb]
;W[qf];B[qg];W[ja];B[pb];W[rb];B[jb];W[ol]C[maybe too small?

reid: If black wins the ko, his next move is M13 which leads to about a 50 point exchange total. This looks like black would have about 70 points even if most of the right side evaporates.  White would have about 60 points, so taking the ko might be reasonable.  Difficult choice psychologically though.]
;B[pl];W[ja];B[sf]C[reid: This ko threat is only about 20 points, so white ignores it.]

;W[jg];B[jh];W[kg]LB[fa:C][bd:B][bg:A][ro:D]C[here starts yose. A-D looks best for strat. I estimate B is ahead now about 5-10 point and have sente. So should be pretty easy. But B lost 6.5 pont.

reid: C and D are both reverse sente for black, so he can only get one of them.  A and B both look like gote to me.  White seems to be better off for sente yose.]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[cg];W[bc];B[bb];W[dc];B[cb];W[be];B[ac];W[ad]
;B[bd];W[oi]C[reid: white gives away two points for this ko threat. O11 is good enough.]
;B[ni];W[bc];B[ab];W[fa];B[ec]C[reid: black should E19 here to prevent white from playing E19 next.  It's worth two points in sente.]
;W[al]C[reid: similarly, white should E19 now for two points.]

C[reid: black gives away a point here - A3 is better. Also, the variation shown at move 217 is now more valuable for white (since he could take-back at A6).]

Thank you for reviewing

reid: I think there are two contributing factors: First, black's right side is very large and might have given black a false sense of security that he had an easy win.  Second, black has too many groups: his four groups (excluding the right side) spent too many moves making eyes and not enough making territory.  In contrast, white has only two groups on the boatrd.

Winning the ko and cutting off the K16 stones allowed white to gain back a lot of ground.

When the yose started, the game was pretty close.  A few little mistakes allowed white to snatch a win.]
