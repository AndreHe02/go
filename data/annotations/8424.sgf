C[Hello, dear Reviewer!

I, HonFu, have played this game on KGS, so probably it was to be expected it would turn out as a fighting game. Black and white were on razor's edge right to the finish. In the end I won, but it felt like it could have been me as well who lost. Anyway, there is a lot of fighting going on and I would like to hear the opinion of a stronger player about our tactical and strategic decisions.

Thanks!

FM: hello, my name is Martin and my comments will begin with FM: as my nick is Field Mouse.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cf]
C[Hon: I chose the large avalanche just because everybody seems to choose it in this kind of position. I have got no idea about the reasons for noone playing the small avalanche, the double hane or whatever.

FM: I think more josekis are possible, but this way is more usual just because people think it is cool :)]
;B[db];W[cc];B[kc]LB[fc:C][qf:A][op:B]C[Hon: Normally I would think that A should come next to keep the black moyo in check. But in this match there was a large move at B too, which also looks like it has to be played now.

Also about A there might be a difference because black extended closer than usual. How should I think about this kind of position?


FM: I think the choice is between C and B now. A is not so big as it will be hard for black to make moyo in the upper right corner - because of the C hole - you can make a wall easily by attacking there and reduce black moyo then. Preventing black shimari in the lower right corner is better.]
(;W[op]C[Hon: I took this move, because my hoshi liked it, but ...]
;B[pn]C[Hon: ... after his answer I felt like it's already getting hard for me. Maybe it is just my subjective emotions because I have a way of losing my games within the first 30 moves, but here I feel like if I play the usual joseki, end in gote and let him have a shimari in the upper right, it is too convenient for him ...

FM: white is perfectly okay, there is no push to invade black position now.]
(;W[qf]C[Hon: ... so I played here after all, leaving P4 in danger.]
;B[qh]C[Hon: Of course black likes his move here, extending nicely from Q6. I felt like I was already being pushed around.

FM: black is happy with this pincer, this is not good for white]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]LB[nd:A]
[lp:B]C[Hon: Now A seemed like a large move for black, also because it helps his thinness in the upper left, but of course he wanted to punish P4 now. I expected B next and was ready to treat the stone lightly, but ...]
;B[mp]C[Hon: ... he played like this, super close, as if he wanted to capture this stone as small as possible. This looked strange to me.

FM: yes, pincering this close is unusual]
(;W[kq]C[Hon: So my former plan of playing lightly fits into the position even better, I thought.

FM: this move makes things too easy for black]
(;B[kp];W[lp]C[FM: good response];B[mq]TR[kp][lp]C[Hon: Here he surprised me again, not even cutting me, wanting that p4 stone so much.

FM: if black planned this then the marked exchange was very bad and black should have played this move directly.]
(;W[lo]LB[iq:B][lq:A]C[Hon: I stretched out, keeping P4 active, making M3 and K4 miai.

FM: white has quite bad shape now, with weaknesses for example at A or B]
(;B[no]LB[nd:A]C[Hon: He captured, in awkward shape I thought.

Locally M3 looks like good shape for me, but here my thinking was, that I still got M3 and K4 as miai, so it might be best to just play the other large move at A and capture the stone down there in a ladder, if he cuts.

FM: yes, M3 would be slow now, although it is quite important to procect against the bad aji. Playing L5 instead of M5 was better. Playing A now is good too.]
(;W[nd]
(;B[jp]C[Hon: But he surprised me with this move.

FM: this is very fighting style. Protecting the E15 group and making some profit is much easier.]
;W[lq]C[Hon: I could only connect, so ...

FM: yes.];B[jq]LB[fd:A]TR[nd]C[Hon: ... suddenly I got a running group.

I am still not sure if it was only bad to allow this in exchange for the marked stone, because that move creates possibilities in the upper left and lower right. But my bottom group has to fight now.

FM: white marked stone was big, but black efficiently destroys any possibility of white making a big moyo on the lower side, which is quite unpleasant. Also if the exchange of marked stone and A would be made black would not be dissatisfied.]
(;W[gq]C[Hon: I thought around here was the only move, but ...

FM: why would it be the only move? Again it is the figting way, but the peaceful one is also possible.]
;B[kn]C[Hon: ... now this kake, which I expected, just feels nice for him.]
;W[nn]C[Hon: I try to use P4 to get better shape here.

FM: yes, looks like it is needed, although it is painful to force black to protect the aji in the corner.]
;B[oo];W[mo];B[mr];W[np];B[pp];W[on];B[po]
(;W[mm]LB[ko:A]C[Hon: I thought, this was not too bad, because I still got the combination M2, K2 to use in a good moment, black is isolated, has a cutting point at A and I am solid and out for now.

FM: the M2 K2 combination is pleasant, but black can play H3 to prevent it - this is a kind of thing you should keep on your mind.]
(;B[jn]C[Hon: He defends. Now I was thinking about how to play on. We are in a fight here, but my group will make no profit anyway, also attacking black directly seemed too unlikely to work ...

FM: black is happy to protect here, although the bamboo is very bad shape.]
(;W[gc]C[Hon: So I decided on making use of my move at P16.

Somehow we keep ignoring each other, but I happen to see that in almost every strong players game. Since I am not too strong though ... am I doing it the right way?


FM: ignoring your opponent because strong player do so will never be good. Ignoring because you think a move elsewhere is the best on the board is the only correct reason :) As for if I think that this move is good - jumping with your lower group first before attacking here seems better. If your opponent will tenuki it and protect the upper group, you will be able to cap the K4 group in sente and invade the right - and that is the profit you can get: strenght and reducing the right side.]
;B[ol]LB[mk:B][kl:C][ll:A][jr:E][lr:D]TR[jn]C[Hon: In the game I felt this was a strong move, but now that I am looking at it ... shouldn't black rather play from his weak side?

For my next move I considered several things.

A is solid, but he will just jump out and have not much of a problem. Also he will settle the right side in the process. B seems worse, because black can jump all the way to L9 and applies even more pressure with the same consequences for the right side. The combination D and E did not work too well after he defended with the marked stone, I would only hurt my lower right, so I put that off.

FM: the profit you would make if you played in this area one move before is obvious when you compare this result with what would happen if you played here first. The difference is in the many points black makes now and the strenght of your group. The problem is that black is very strong everywhere - you cannot do really much now and must be careful.]
(;W[lr]C[Hon: First I forced once with M2, so I could be sure of K2 when I needed it ...]
;B[oq];W[kl]C[Hon: ... then I chose the point C, which is not solid but leaving a weak point right before my opponent's eyes. I thought it would be necessary to put pressure on him too, not to make the battle too one-sided.]
;B[lm]C[Hon: He atekomied right away ...];W[ll]C[Hon: ... and cut, as maybe it was to be expected. I am really not sure if this was another bad mistake on my side.

FM: the cut feels a bit too brute, but it is very effective too.. if black read out that the two white cutting stones can be captured]
;B[ml];W[nl];B[mk];W[nk]C[Hon: Now I felt like I had to push and push and push ...]
;B[mj];W[nj];B[om];W[nm];B[mi];W[ni];B[mh]C[Hon: ... grandly helping him in the center while remaining eyeless myself.

For some unknown reason I did not think this far before I played the dangerous cap. Maybe I felt like I would cancel that plan if I really looked at it.


FM: black takes a lot of influence with his moves];W[og]TR[kl]
C[Hon: I vainly hoped to get strong enough for the moment and get to separate black with my marked cutting group. But was that likely anyway?


FM: the marked cutting group can be caught in geta anytime. You were quite lucky black didn't notice.]
;B[ne];W[nf]C[Hon: Bad shape in my feeling, but if I get out here, I can use N12 as a target.

FM: no other option for white here, this move is good];B[me]
;W[mf]
(;B[le]C[FM: black could use whites weak shape much better, I think this is the losing move of the game.]
;W[oe];B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[lf];B[ke];W[kf];B[mb]C[Hon: He forced here ...

FM: yes.];W[nb]
(;B[jh]LB[jk:A]C[Hon: ... then jumped out.

FM: yes. Capturing at A was much better.];W[je]TR[oe]C[FM: black shape here is really bad, there is no good way of play now. Black should have not allowed the marked cut.]
;B[ic];W[jd];B[lc]LB[hd:A]C[Hon: I exchanged these moves, saw that there was a lot of aji for later ...

FM: black did really bad here, A will cause a lot of problems even if you play it now. - the game looks quite lost for black now]
;W[il]C[Hon: ... and left it for now to start my counter attack.

FM: sure];B[jk];W[jl];B[go]C[Hon: This is what happens often in my games - we both end up with multiple running groups. If it is viable, I'm alright of course, but these kind of positions also leave a feeling like luck would become a major force deciding the result of the game.]
(;W[hp]LB[jr:A]C[Hon: This here is bad shape, but I thought that it gives me rhythm for running with my center stones and also creates the opportunity to connect with A, taking pressure off my right side group.]
(;B[hn];W[gm]C[Hon: This maybe was too much, but ... well, it was the shape point, it was just too yummy. Should I rather have played a one point jump or something?

FM: pincering the enemy stone from both sides is standard fighting technique, black is in trouble.]
(;B[eo];W[ep];B[hm];W[hl];B[fp];W[fq]C[FM: white is happy to strenghten the corner]
;B[gl]C[Hon: Pulling out the single stone now would leave my center stones in distress, so ...]
;W[hj]C[Hon: ... I felt like my only option was this. I expected him to capture the cutting stone now, but now that I look at it this might be too hard on his center group, especially as there might be opportunities to use the aji at the top then.]
(;B[ig]C[Hon: He played some kind of defensive move ...];W[fm]
LB[nh:B][pj:C][fk:A]C[Hon: ... and I came out here consequently, attacking his lower side group while setting up a net at A.

I think that B would become a threat now that the options on the upper side decrease. Maybe I should have thought about that more in the beginning? Of course right now there was no time to worry about it, the music was playing in the lower left.

FM: yes, the problem for black is that the lower group must make eyes in gote now. For that reason there is no worry for white now. B really is a weakness you should have on your mind and should protect it in the right time, for example with C]
;B[do];W[cp]
(;B[co]LB[fk:A][dl:B]C[Hon: Yes, I COULD play A now, but then he just lives. Maybe B was a good compromise, keeping pressure on him while also aiming at taking G8, but ...]
;W[dm]TR[co]C[Hon: ... I chose this one.

FM: this move is the correct one, black group is in danger. The marked exchange was good for white.]
;B[el];W[em];B[gk]LB[kc:G][dd:H][kf:F][jh:E][hj:D][el:C][em:B]
[eo:A]C[Hon: With this combo of his, the danger of the fight increases even more.

There are so many groups which have bad aji or are plain weak which I tried to mark with A to H. One is inclined to ask - how could this mess happen?

FM: simple answer - you both did not protect your weaknesses and were trying only to attack each other :)]
;W[ii];B[ek];W[ck]C[Hon: I decided for this side, leaving the center half-surrounded, because I just couldn't let him kill me with a move on this point. I felt like his lower side group didn't have a wealth of liberties so I might make it a semeai.]
;B[gh]C[Hon: Of course he surrounds me now.];W[hg];B[hh];W[ih]
;B[jg];W[fi]C[Hon: I try to get out attacking G9 ...];B[cj]
;W[bj];B[dj];W[bn];B[hf];W[gj];B[bi]C[Hon: ... but at this point I see that I can not win this fight only playing passively but have to risk a semeai.

FM: at this point you should be able to read out that black will have five libs in the semai when you attack his group with brute force (not making the figh one eye vs none) - if you have a few minutes of thinking time. The sequence is quite one way street.]
;W[bo]C[Hon: I connected here ready to be surrounded. It was hard to count liberties though, I half-way felt them more than knowing them.

FM: as your group clearly has more than five libs outside the black grou you can play here.]
;B[dh];W[ji]C[Hon: I had planned to play here in sente, so that I would get an eye and some liberties.]
;B[ki];W[kj];B[kh];W[eg]C[Hon: I create some aji at the top for later (maybe rather aji keshi?) ...]
;B[eh];W[ho]C[Hon: ... then I start taking his liberties.];B[gn]
;W[in];B[im];W[io];B[jm];W[ln];B[km];W[fo];B[fn];W[jo];B[ko]
;W[jr]LB[cn:5][dn:4][en:A][fo:B][gp:1][ip:2][iq:3]C[FM: black clearly has five liberties (AB are not libs as they will be white sente)]
;B[kk]C[Hon: This looks like a strange plan of his but I am really not sure about his options. Maybe he could have reduced my liberties more with another move?

FM: no chance for black here]
(;W[lk]C[FM: making things more complicated is unnecessary when you can win easily]
;B[lj];W[jj];B[ik];W[hk]
(;B[hi]C[FM: ah];W[ij];B[jk]C[Hon: Now I was happy about my next move. :-)]
;W[fj]C[Hon: Making an empty triangle and peeping at his bamboo joint from two sides I got my bad shapes "two in one"! :-) But it gave me the liberties to win the race.]
;B[fh];W[en];B[ej];W[iq];B[ei]LB[nh:A]C[Hon: Here I counted liberties and saw that I didn't need to answer.

What was the yummiest point? I thought the right side, which was to be closed with only one more move.

FM: playing on the right side to protect the A cut is good enough now]
;W[qk]C[Hon: I came here, proud about knowing that either Q10 and Q9 did not work for him ...]
;B[gi];W[gp];B[pi]C[Hon: ... only to see that this simple peep cuts me of. Shameful!

FM: no problem when winning by a lot ;)];W[nh];B[ok];W[jf];B[cb]
C[Hon: When this move came, I thought - oops. I had not thought about the possibility of this group getting problems since we first played the avalanche here. I totally forgot about the safety of these stones.]
;W[ed]TR[eg]C[Hon: But I thought I should have no problems at least living with it, and since I killed him down there it would be enough to win the game.

FM: yes, white is okay. Looks like the marked stone played for aji was good :)]
;B[bb]C[Hon: He probably knew it too, so he tried for something harder ...]
;W[eb]C[Hon: ... but the sequence starting with this cut here is the finishing blow.

I know this game is a mess. Please help me see what I didn't, give me some alternatives and also some hints about how to correct or improve my thinking to become stronger.

Thank you!

FM: You both walked the warriors path in this game, did not protect much and were trying a lot to attack each other. When two players like this meet the game is always fun - although it is not my style. I hope you liked my comments, feel free to give me any feedback. Seeya around on KGS :-)]
