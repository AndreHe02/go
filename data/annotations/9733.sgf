(;W[ql]LB[qn:A]C[should I just r3 here since nothing is developed around d16? (see how this progresses and white takes stuff up there first)

Well, the presence of White's pincer gives some difficulties, but let us explore what we can.
1)There's still 2 (not 1) free corners, so they are like miai.
2) Your 4-4 stone in the upper right is:
2a) about wide development, so I don't like r3 here - it gives White a wall looking at alone 4-4 stone;
2b) about support in fighting - so, when you played A but White answered with a hit, start a fight with him.

Please, look at the variations for details.];B[on];W[np]

;B[nm];W[pm];B[nl]LB[qg:A]C[move 19, should I have gone to D16 instead? I thought this was the joseki but I feel like I'm losing by too much

No, I suggest your connection is right. And I don't say you're losing, because:
1)White's corner is still open, so his territory is smaller;
2)You connected, so your wall is stronger than a couple of moves before;
3)According to joseki, White missed R14 - so you may hit at A and take your own profit there.]

(;W[dc]LB[qg:A][lq:B][qq:C]C[Move 20-21, should go to q6 now? But White is still safe if r14 so I just chose to tenuki at D4, Was this okay or bad since it's too far from my potential moyo?  and maybe too early for r3?

I can't say White is so safe if you play Q6. You may later attack at A-C, according to the situation, but let me say: in Go we don't build territory (or a moyo) directly, because it's too straightforward and slow - we get territory while attacking. And each attack starts from splitting partner's groups.

On the other hand, if you don't like attacking so much, your choice (a free corner) is OK.]
;B[dp];W[pn]C[Is r3 still possible for a ko? if so when should I play it?

I think it's possible for a life (see the variation), but it's not so urgent.]

(;B[de];W[dh]LB[fe:A]TR[og][pi][pj][pk][nl][ol][nm][dp]C[I really have no idea what to play after getting pincered like this.. I already feel like I'm losing psychologically

I suggest the same idea: you have a wall and a strong 4-4 stone (marked) - so just split, and then attack. A seems ok for me for this purpose.]

(;B[fd];W[ee];B[ed];W[dd];B[ef]C[Should I have d14 instead so white can't connect up on the left side?

I think no, because this will be a longer fight, and it's harder for both.]

(;B[df]C[This goes against the principle: when you have a stone in a ladder (and therefore some ladder-breaker aji), take it off as soon as possible.]
;W[cf]C[I let the computer connect up because I thought I could build a huge moyo here

Yes, I see. But did you measure this word 'huge' in terms of real points?]
;B[jd]C[I think this is necessary, right?

Yes, I agree.];W[cn]C[not sure if I should pincer here..white now feels too strong over there..or c10? possible to cut off white maybe? What would be a good pincer if black wanted to pincer white here? c9? or normal c8?

I think it's too late for a pincer, but we can make White overconcentrated.]

;B[lq]C[thought I could do this now and use aji with p6 + indirectly help my above moyo

Yes, I feel it's a good idea against White's corner (though we can live there directly). But 'indirectly help my moyo' - what do you mean by that?]
;W[dq];B[ep]LB[cp:A]C[was afraid of getting cut off so didn't play e3, but now that I think about it e3 is better right?

I hope it is, but please remember the joseki move (Black at A) and just get rid of these situations :)]

;W[fl]LB[lk:3][jm:A][lo:2][fp:1]C[doesn't feel like I can capture it anymore..

Yes, now we should care about our stones first.
Observe how it goes: White attacks and so gets more profit than you did with the moyo. The problem posiibly is: when you played A, you aimed to hold three goals (left group 1, right group 2, moyo above 3) simultaneously - that's impossible.]

;B[gg];W[fb]C[Not sure the best move for blocking these kind of things, g17?

I think your move 75 is right (though it can't win the game now).]
;B[hc];W[hb];B[ic]LB[cp:A]C[Let me summarize:

1. Be careful about the proper joseki moves - they are important for the future of your groups (like the move at A in this game caused problems with the whole bottom side);
2. Try to reach your goal fast (in one move), but don't pick up too much goals - you are to win only 0.5 points, you don't need more;
3. Please, consider this idea: the profit of a single cut (or, vice versa, of a single connection) is sometimes uncountable.

Thank you for providing interesting and researching questions within the game!]
