C[Hi, I play as Numsgil on KGS.  Currently ranked 8 kyu.

The main reason you lost this game is simply that black had more territory.  I know that seems like a silly statement, since of course black has more territory if he won.  But what I mean is you weren't really out fought tactically.  You lost because you allowed black to build up his moyo on the bottom right.  If you keep an eye on the balance of territory as you play games, you'll win more games like this.  When the opponent pulls ahead, pull him back down.

The best time to invade a moyo is right before it's finished.  But it's also the riskiest, and "finished" is difficult to define.  So at our non-shodan level, invade when you feel threatened by black's moyo.  That's usually when it's more like 75% done.  Don't leave it and hope it'll get better later.  It won't.

Reduction is also usually a safer alternative to invasions.  Doubly so if you have your own framework nearby so you can expand it at the same time you reduce your opponent.  Reduce at the "door" of the opponent's moyo.  That's the imaginary line between two stones in the moyo that's open to the outside, without any stones in between.  You can also think of it as the "border" of the moyo.

Anyway, I hope this review is helpful.  Don't feel shy about emailing me questions.]

(;W[gq]C[I like the joseki that comes from the two space high approach better.  But it's a judgement call here really (yes, black responded oddly).]
;B[iq];W[fo];B[io];W[fm];B[dj]C[This is too high on black's part.]
;W[dl]C[This is fine, but I think you'd be better to push from the other side.  You're relatively strong on the bottom.  Don't be afraid to push your opponent towards places where you are strong if it means you can also strengthen a weaker area (eg: your top left star stone).]
;B[dg]C[Black is too high.  I think you can rob him of a base and send him running towards the center.  The best way of doing that isn't clear, though.  So leaving it be is probably fine if you can't see a good way to attack.  See variation for my thought.]
(;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[jd];B[fc]
(;W[ec]C[Okay, so this is the first move that starts feeling wrong-ish.

When you kick a stone (that's what this is called), you aren't defending.  You are attacking.  The goal is to either make it heavy, and gain profit (territory) while chasing it around the board, or to make it over concentrated.

Because of the black group on the left, black should have no trouble running and being safe.  So you can maybe get a little profit from it, but you still need to go back and defend the corner.

You never never never ever ever ever want to kick and just leave it.  Two white stones at a diagonal in contact with a two stone black wall is bad for white.  You need to follow up in some way.

See variations];B[fd]
(;W[pj]C[Just to drive the point home, this is a bad tenuki.  See variations.]
;B[pm]C[Black is threatening your white stone.  It does not have a base.  So you need to extend towards the center or react in some other way.  This is not a good stone to play and leave.

Black is also gaining profit by attacking your weak stone.  Don't place stones if the opponent can immediately push them around to gain profit.]
(;W[nf]C[This does not work well with the stone you just played.  Consider instead pressing black and building a wall.  Black gets 4th line territory, which is sort of a pain, but at this point the damage is done.

See variation.];B[oh]C[This is a good move by black.  White is cut in two.  Oops.]

;B[if]
(;W[ke];B[he]C[Do not give black a ponnuki.  Even if the group will still be captured eventually, extend from an atari of one stone (unless it's a ladder obviously).

Black will probably not remove the stones from the board, so they will be a thorn in black's plans for the rest of the game.  They might have some life in the end game, or allow you to make moves elsewhere in sente.

Allowing an opponent to get a ponnuki, on the other hand, means he has power and influence that radiates like a star over the whole board.

Dead stones on board = possible power to be untapped in the future

Removed stones = unhindered strength for white];W[jf];B[ie]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[ig]C[Don't push like this unless you can gain immediate advantage.  All you do is force black to reinforce, gain maybe 1 point, and remove a liberty from your group.  Generally speaking, 1 point < 1 liberty.  Treasure liberties.  Protect them.]
;B[hg];W[jh];B[ii]
(;W[il]C[Ill timed and ill placed.  See variation.

Basically you encourage black to invade to the right.  You're also a bit thin.  And you gave up in the middle of a pushing battle.]
(;B[jm]C[Black's response was passive, so it made your questionable move okay.  But black has a huge moyo turning into territory now, so he still gets the better of this I think.]
;W[jl];B[km];W[kl];B[lm];W[ni]C[Your center territory is smaller than you think.
