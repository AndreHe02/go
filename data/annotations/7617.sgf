AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Thanks in Advance.
I am around 10k-11k on KGS.
(Last few games, I have bounced up and down between them)

I played Black, my opponent was unrated at the time.

My two biggest questions are on the response to white's invasion at R17 and also the results of the first ko battle.

I also have some minor questions on the opening moves, and some other moves.

Thanks!
Casey

[Inego\] Hi, I'm Yanis Batura from Siberia, I play as Googol [6k\] at KGS, I'll try to help you to better understand your mistakes in this game.
My English may be lacking sometimes but I hope that won't eclipse what I intended to say.
Looking at the final position it becomes obvious that you missed a crucial moment somewhere in the game when your top group should've escaped or established life, and that led to the death of your dragon.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[hc]C[I knew that my extension was too long to be defended... But I thought that with the weakness of the two white stones that I could make something of it.

[Inego\] In the hands of a stronger player these two white stones can in no sense be called "weak", and you shouldn't perceive them this way. Move 4 cannot be called an attack or even pressure, and the fact that W tenukis after 4 supports this.

This group turned out to be the reason that I resigned.

[Inego\] The reason you lost this game were several key mistakes later.]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[jq];B[dr]TR[mq][nq]C[I felt that White's extension was too large, and wanted to prepare for a move at H3, while taking the corner territory.

[Inego\] 8 is a quite secure move, although a bit passive at this stage of play. Notice, however, that after 8 there are 3 black stones in the LL corner and only one in the LR corner. Perhaps, slightly better was to put some pressure from the right side?]
;W[ci];B[cf];W[cl]
(;B[cm]C[I have been told again and again that the attach to a single stone is not advised...

[Inego\] It depends. Here, your move was absolutely OK.

I was considering C6 as an alternative. But that seemed too passive.
Thoughts, Please?

[Inego\] 12 is better than C6. It provokes W to answer, while after C6 W could tenuki.]
;W[dl]
(;B[dm]C[[Inego\] Empty triangle can very rarely be a good move. In this position it is very ineffective. Much better was a jump like F6.]
;W[qk]C[[Inego\] Look at the board. Which corner needs more help, UR or LR? Of course, LR!]
;B[qh];W[qn];B[nq]C[I chose O3 because I thought it was a more solid shape, especially with the white stones on O3.
Is this the correct thinking for thiscorner?  Or is there something else I should be thinking about when choosing between a one point jump and a knight's move?

[Inego\] Considering the presence of W stones at both sides of the corner, 18 is the most solid answer to W approach at 17.]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb]
(;B[oc]C[[Inego\] You could attack Q18 first.]
(;W[qe]C[It seems to me that the joseki is S15 at this point.

[Inego\] In handicap games, W player usually tends to overplay, so there's no reason to talk about joseki.

So, what is my best response here?

[Inego\] The sequence you played is OK.];B[qd];W[rd];B[qf];W[re]
;B[pe];W[jf]C[[Inego\] Now your group is somewhat weak and has to fight to stabilize.]
;B[ld]C[I ended up abandoning the group created from this stone.
So, this must not have been the best next course of action...

[Inego\] You could capture O17 and the first move (34) was OK.

Maybe M17 would have been better?

[Inego\] M17 is good, too. If O17 tries to run, you can chase him and then connect underneath at a proper time.

Some move in this area on my part  seems correct... Because I can split the O17 and K16 stones, and the K16/14 stones will need to look for a base.

[Inego\] Absolutely.];W[lc];B[kc];W[kd]
(;B[jc]C[[Inego\] A mistake. You should've sacrificed L17 in order to get O17 you were aiming at (see var.).]
;W[md];B[le];W[id];B[ic];W[mf];B[me];W[ne];B[lf]C[I need to stop insisting on believing that my opponent will try to play the way I want them too... :)
I was thinking that by pushing at N15, I would create a weakness, which would allow be to threaten a double atari when white blocked at M14.
So here is a question... Shortly after this, I abandoned these stones.
Was that the correct thing to do?
Should I have kept pushing those stones forward?  or would that have created a weak group without purpose?

[Inego\] Actually, there are two unstable groups on the board, N15 and Q15. I'd try to save Q15 first, although N15 is not a small sacrifice, too.]
(;W[mg];B[kg];W[jg];B[hd]C[[Inego\] Huh? Leaving your stones to be captured? If you started to  run, then run! L12 is the only answer. And remember, the longer you run, the better your chances to save your group.]
(;W[ji]C[[Inego\] W could capture your stones simply by playing at L12.]
(;B[nh]C[[Inego\] You could start a ko fight or connect your groups underneath (see var.)]
;W[mh];B[ni];W[nf]C[I hoped to use the threat of connecting the stones to increase the territory on the east side.

[Inego\] I don't quite understand what territory you are talking about.]
;B[qj];W[pj];B[pi];W[rj];B[ri];W[qi]C[[Inego\] The ko fight is not in your favor, since you don't have many ko threats while W has plenty.]
;B[je];W[ie];B[qj];W[dc];B[cc];W[qi];B[pa];W[qb];B[qj];W[cd]
;B[bd];W[qi];B[lb]C[[Inego\] At last!];W[mc];B[qj];W[ed]
(;B[ce]C[[Inego\] Better was D15.];W[qi];B[nd]C[[Inego\] As mentioned before, N18 isn't even a ko threat, it's just a solid move solving your problem even without ko fighting.]
;W[od]C[[Inego\] You still can connect underneath.];B[qj];W[mb]
C[[Inego\] Chance vanished.];B[rk];W[qi];B[oe];W[kb];B[jb];W[la]
;B[qj];W[fc];B[he];W[hf]
(;B[fe];W[ee]
(;B[ff]C[[Inego\] A game losing move. Why were you afraid of hane? Your H15 group looks stronger than W four stones. See var.]
;W[ef]C[[Inego\] W happily get out of danger and the top B group is now in Big trouble.]
;B[fd];W[gc];B[fg];W[eg];B[hg];W[if];B[sj]C[When I was thinking back on the game, before reviewing it... My thought was that the first ko battle went well.
At this point, I am no longer so sure.
I think that the fight, and white's upcoming extensions did a lot of damage to white's corner at R6.
But there is also a wall at E16, that connects to C11's group, and makes it stronger.
What do you think?  Was this a good result for the ko fight?  What would have been better?

[Inego\] I think the ko fight was useless as you could connect your groups by playing at M18. Now you saved your right side group, but let W save their risky invasion and separate and attack your top group. Happily, W stones in LR are weak, too. But before attacking opponent's weak groups you should defend yours first.]
;W[mi];B[nj];W[mj];B[hq]C[[Inego\] A logical continuation of your play is to extend one more stone further! O9

I thought I needed this to give my group at F16/H16 a place to run to, and also because I thought it was becoming a big move that needed to be played soon... Or else white would fix the exposure.

[Inego\] In itself, 108 isn't a bad move, but, as I mentioned at the previous move, you should try to defend your top group first which is as big as unstable - so it's your priority #1.]
;W[nk]C[I was surprised by this move

[Inego\] 109 should be your move. W felt this and played there.]

;B[iq];W[jo]
(;B[kp]C[[Inego\] 122 is an awful move. It is sky clear what the opponent's response will be and whether you will be satisfied with the outcome. Locally, playing at K2 is better.]
;W[jp]C[[Inego\] Of course! You've just made the W group separating your stones stronger, and created a hanging weak stone 122.]

;W[cg];B[bg];W[ch]
(;B[eh]C[Not my best move.
Not sure how the fight would have went with that stone better placed.

[Inego\] Yes, you can make two eyes at J18 and G12, but when you make the first, your opponent will always prevent you from making the second, so this group is almost hopeless. You need a miracle to save it.]

I thought it was just to kill my shape... So, I wanted to ensure that I had another eye at the G18 area.

[Inego\] Even if you connect at F12, the opponent destroys your second eye at the top on the next move.]

I recommend you playing more fast-paced games, solving go problems and studying unequal games. By unequal games I mean games where a much stronger player plays against a much weaker player WITHOUT handicap (although their kind is rare, you can discover these on KGS while browsing first games of today's Top 100 players when they were [?\]). In unequal games, a stronger player's dominance in style and fighting can be seen with unaided eye, and you can always try to imitate his manner of play - with varied success, of course.

May the Force be with you.])
