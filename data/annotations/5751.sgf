C[I lost this game because I failed to reduce or invade the moyo white made on the right side.
I was thinking about it but I couldn't see an effective reduction or a safe invasion.

I must have made a direction-of-play mistake during the fight that grew out of the top side.
It's also possible that my choise of  joseki in the beginning was poor.

[Hi, Andrew.  I will put all of my commentary in brackets so if you have additional comments they will be seperated for ease-of-viewing. I hope my commentary is correct enough; fuseki and early middlegame are my strengths, so that's where a lot of my ideas will focus. By the way, I would appreciate feedback - if you think a comment I made is bunk, just tell me.  I can take it :)\]]

(;B[qn]C[[This is a little nitpicky, but what about the enclosure on the upper right?  Shusaku was fond of it, can't be bad.  Besides, approaching a symmetrical stone like 4:4 is not quite as urgent as resolving an asymmetrical placement like komoku.  I'd go for r15 here.  If white takes k4... see var. to 5\]]

;W[qe]TR[op][pp][qp][ro][qo][ql]C[[This kind of illustrates the problem with the approach at 5. White gets to dictate terms and black has to take them.  Not to mention that white has made good use of the thickness of the marked stones.  In response to 16, I'd probably choose a high pincer, since a low one would probably just be a target for attack - maybe q12 would be an idea.\]]
;B[od];W[ph];B[ec];W[mo];B[cj]TR[qj]C[[Nice.  So at this moment the game doesn't seem that bad for you in light of the fact that you have some moyo potential and white still has some weaknesses on the right.  For example I would be eyeing the play at r10 during the game to see if anything becomes possible, though it doen't seem prudent now.  The three white stones are the thinnest, so I'd wait for the inevitable white play at the top (which comes at 22) to begin a leaning attack to exploit that thinness\]]
;W[mc]
(;B[jc]TR[nf]C[[23 seems like a well-paced move, though white had little ambition on the follow up.  Suppose he played at the marked point?  I'm not saying 23 is bad, it does strike a nice balance and it makes good use of the enclosure plus pincer, but you are helping white in a way to jump out and enclose the corner.  Beware of creating too many groups!  That's something I should listen to myself. As an alternative in line with my suggestion at 21... see var\]\]]
;W[rc];B[me];W[ee]LB[jc:23][mc:22]TR[fd]C[[What about the kosumi at the marked point?  This seems good as it further hampers any action on the part of 22, as well as strengthen 23.  You'd have to know the continuations for some tricky stuff though.  Re: Sakata Eio's Middlegame of Go, Vol. I.  All about this position, actually.\]]

(;B[je]C[[This may be a bad idea, but I would opt for the pillar at k16 here, as white is thicker on the left and the proverb "Where your opponent is thick, you must become thick."\]]
;W[jb]
(;B[ib]C[[This is a tough one, but I think that the tiger's mouth at l16 might do the job.  No matter which way white goes, one of his groups is still heavy/weak, while you have settled yourself on both sides.  And white still can get cut off.  37 is an overplay I think.\]]
;W[kc];B[jd];W[le]
(;B[lf]C[[41 is too tight, methinks.  You are risking being caught in a big fight, which occurs over the next 50 moves.  Simplify the game by allowing the opponent to play peacefully.]
;W[mf];B[ne];W[kf];B[lg];W[ke];B[ng]C[[Honte.  Probably the best move at the moment.\]]
;W[kb]
(;B[ig]C[[49 seems like korigatachi (stretching thin to attack a group.) Since white has taken l18, black might need to take g18 to stabilize. White is still on the run in two places, so I think you have time to do it. Not to mention that white can push up at l13 in sente, as it awakens the marked netted stone.\]]
;W[hb]C[[Yep.  50 is pretty painful.  49 is better at g18.]
;B[ia];W[jf];B[if];W[hd];B[hc];W[jh];B[gg];W[fh];B[hi]C[[Up to 59, black is on the run, having been swindled at the top out of good shape.  Look at the next 20 moves as the direction of play begins to weaken the top group.  I couldn't possibly look at all the continuations for a semeai involving three groups, but the point I'm making is that in attacking white too hard you ended up with a burdened group at the top.\]]

;B[jk];W[kk];B[jl];W[of];B[nf];W[nj]C[Now the right side is very big and my own group is in danger. I could say I lost the game already.
I've been thinking about invading or reducing the right side but it's too late now.

I'm only interested in the review up to this point.

[Thanks for having me review the game.  Final comment: You're adept at fighting and developing, but I guess I would suggest that you take a breather right before you attack a group over a long sequence.  It might be better to not attack yet, if you're not sure where the fight will spill into.  In this case, white took control because your moves from 41 or so were too focused on attacking and lost sight of stability.  The losing move (a guess, I'm not nearly strong enough to correct most of the play here) would probably be 49, as from that point on white seemed to leverage the stability of the left group (which is still weak, but out) to get the initiative to play a moyo-enhancer like 88. I haven't done too much file-based reviewing, so this is a good learning experience for me.  I hope I helped with at least one thing :).     Matt\]]

(;B[qe];W[jp];B[qn]TR[jc]C[[Black has a nice position here, and k17 will be big.  Also, traditionally white hates to give black 2 enclosures, so it's possible white would postpone k4 to approach, simply to prevent both shimaris.   If white pincers now...\]]

;B[cn]C[[This is fine with me.  I would think that this is an ok position.. Don't know about the high approach but I guess it would be a little off-balance considering the upper left.  I imagine some players (including me sometimes) are wary of encouraging the opponent to develop in ways that are beneficial, but it's a point in go to be gracious and allow the opponent some area, just not enough to win :).\]]
