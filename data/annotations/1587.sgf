C[Hello I am sending this game for review.  I was white and IGS has me
between 26* and now 29*.  I don't understand the rating sys. there.  In this
game I won but would like some points on the beginning of the game.  I
really focused on the middle game more this time than I have in the past but
I think I set myself up for struggle due to a weak start... so it seemed.
Please give some advice.

Thank you for your help; it is appreciated. Mitch.];B[dd]C[Dear Mitch,n
    there are several interesting things to say about this game. As you
requested, I will have a closer look at the Fuseki. But some points later on
are also worth mentioning.n
    So let's start.

Don't take me for a snob, but I prefer the maybe old-fashioned polite and
calm style of play. Part of it is the first move played in the upper right
corner. I know, it was your opponent, but];W[pp]C[it is also considered as polite to let the weaker player decide,
whether he wants to play diagonal or not.n
    Don't take this too serious, but I know many people to be delighted
having a polite opponent.n
    Anyway, tactically no mistake up to now ;-)];B[pd]
(;W[dq]LB[co:X]C[If you play a 3-4 stone, why giving the open side to your opponent?n
   If B now plays the kakari on X, he attacks you with an own stone in the
back.n
   3-4 is absolute ok, but better take the other one.n
   See variation.n
   If you're thinking of getting a shimari on 4 and X, try playing X first
and then 4.n
   But with move 4 you definetly invite B to play the kakari on X.]
;B[jd]LB[co:X]C[He didn't heard that, huh?

Second chance to play X];W[qf]C[He played already in the upper half. Unnecessary attack. Strengthen
your own position instead of giving him something to work with.]
;B[co]C[B thought the same way :-)]
(;W[rd]LB[of:X]C[Better X.n
   Gives you a good position with the lower right corner and 8 can be played
later. B should answer like shown in the variation and you keep sente.]
;B[nc]LB[qc:X]C[Too weak.n
   If B answers, on X.];W[pf]C[Compare that move with my suggestion for move 8 and the difference
of sente and gote.];B[hp]LB[ep:X]C[The right idea, but better on X.]
;W[eo]C[good];B[dn]
(;W[bq]C[ok, but taking the corner doesn't put much pressure on B.n
   See variation.];B[dm]LB[en:X]C[too slow, wrong side.n
   Better X, getting a wall facing upwards.];W[en];B[em];W[gn]
C[With a little help from B you got a similar position as I suggested,
but 18 should be one further to the right.n
   Don't be afraid of being cut. B can't connect also and W will win by
liberties.];B[kp]
(;W[qm]C[Too cautious!n
   See variation.];B[di];W[fd]C[Maybe you were afraid of missing the right time for an invasion, so
it's ok.n
   But was an invasion necessary?n
   Estimate the territories.n
  You're slightly in the lead.n
  By chasing the B stones on the lower side you gain secure territory in the
lower right, lower left and the whole right side. If you also get the B
stones, you easily win. If not, you wil get enough outside strength in the
middle to backup invasions in at least three points.n
  But if B get do it vice versa, you will get problems.n
  See variation.]
(;B[cf]C[As long as B is so lenient, your chances are good, but always think
of stronger opponents not so afraid of white stones ;-)];W[ic]
;B[ld]LB[jc:X]C[Bad!n
  Must be X.];W[jc]C[good.];B[kc];W[db]LB[ec:X]C[Too far.n
  What, if B cuts at X?n
  Live in the corner? That you could've had easier by Invading at 3-3.]
;B[de]C[With such a frightened opponent it's hard to learn from mistakes...]
;W[ec]C[But you playing this stone shows that you 're aware of the problem
within your former move. Try to think of them just one move earlier.]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[qj];W[ph];B[oi];W[id];B[je];W[mq]C[Good, but must be earlier.n
  Now B has already three points in the middle to escape to.]
;B[kr];W[nm]LB[kn:X][mi:X][qq:Y][qp:Y][pq:Y][mo:X]C[This move does nothing but to look omnipotent. In fact he neither
puts any pressure on any B group (X) nor does he cut them really nor does
he save the corner (Y) and the territorial win is about three points.
Better to do one thing really good than those in-between-moves.]

[fm:Z][ij:Z]C[Unnecessary.n
 If you want to play there, play X, but there's no danger yet, so better
take any of the big points marked Y.n
 Or save your middle group while attacking at Z.];B[ql]C[Also unnecessary. The group is save.]
;W[gl]LB[fm:Z]C[Possible, but more risky than Z and with no more territorial gain.]

please defend the solid way at Y.n

 Why not X?];B[dl];W[fl]C[That was one point in gote. A move in the lower left is worth 8 to
10 points.];B[ej];W[fj];B[dj]C[The same for B.];W[ij];B[jk]
;W[bo]LB[ao:X][an:X]C[right idea, but gote. Try the other two moves.]

 Gotcha!n
 You do play those "tricky" defending moves! :-)n
 You have to play one of the X's anyway, so why not now?n
 In some games one point can be painful.];B[jb];W[ib];B[kb]
;W[lo];B[nl];W[om];B[pe];W[re]C[That's it.n
 Nice game. You were right with your thought of a bad beginning.n
Try to get your stones work potentially together. Strengthen weak groups
instead of creating additional weak groups.n
When you attack, try to put pressure onto your opponent and avoid to get
under fire yourself.n
To put under pressure means not killing. In fact you very seldom kill
attacked groups, but use the attack to gain influence and territory
elsewhere, while the opponent fights for his stones to live with a few
points.n
If you have any questions or critics, feel free to ask.n
Best wishes,

Peter])
