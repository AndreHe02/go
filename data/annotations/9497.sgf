C[First of all, thank you for commenting my game.

In this game I'm playing B agains the program Many Faces of Go.

I'm a 10k at KGS server who has been struggling for a while to improve.

I have made comments through the game with some questions.

I hope you find my game entretaining.

Thanks again.

[R\] Hi! I am the reviewer. I wrote my comments with the tag [R\] 

At the last move I placed my general comments.
I hope this review can be of use to you!];B[qd];W[dc];B[pp]
;W[dq];B[oc];W[qj];B[qn]C[[R\] This move is very point oriented.

This can be OK. 
But, please do not forget about approaching corners first!]
;W[co]
(;B[kp]C[[R\] What about the unfinished upper left corner?
In this shape I would prefer an extension to K3.]
(;W[ce]C[After this opening we have two corners each. W being more solid, but B bigger. Any comments about the opeinig are welcome.

[R\] I do not agree on the evaluation!

I do not find Black bigger! 

Don't forget White has the additional komi points.

It is very big (and rare) that White can close two corners!]

(;B[hq]C[[R\] This move is very points oriented.

Do not forget that, if we prevent our opponent from taking a really big point, it's a big move, too.]
;W[dj]C[At this point I feel that I already lost the left side. Maybe B D10 would have been a better move instead of B H3?

[R\] I agree on this evaluation. 
Black D10 was much bigger than Black H3.

D10 is worth about 50 points.
A move like H3 is worth about 20 or 30 points.

However...
The left side is not lost yet!

It is still possible to play there (but be prepared to fight)]
;B[jd]C[[R\] The last big point has been taken. Now it's time to start the middle game]
;W[ql]C[[R\] solid but very slow and small];B[qg];W[ol]
(;B[nq]C[[R\] This move is very point oriented.
I understand that Black was afraid of a White invasion on the lower side.
It was also important to prevent White from building points on the upper side. 
I would have probably played G17 in this position.


I have the impression, by watching this opening, that Black player likes territory, is afraid of cuts, and that he wants to build up his territory little by little.

But in go, usually if you play like this, you will not have enough points!]
;W[hc]C[[R\] Black is starting to be behind in points here...

But no worries, Black can still invade]
(;B[fc]C[B F17 looks like a mistake. I wanted to cut W H17, but didn't have a chance. Maybe should have played B K17?

[R\] This move is very aggressive, locally it's maybe possible, but it is not following a natural opening order.

Bigger and open spaces should be played first!

Alternatives:
 - K17 or K18 (prepares an invasion at F17)
 - invasion at C7 or C8
 - invasion at C12 or C13];W[he]
(;B[lc]C[Here I didn't play B K17 out of fear of a cut.

[R\] But K17 would exploit the F17 stone.
The move played in the game is too defensive.];W[fe]
(;B[dm]C[Didn't know what to do and came up with this.

[R\] OK, so you played a reducing move.
But reducing / invading with a high stone, makes it difficult to make a base.

Also, do not forget to use the aji of stones you already played!

F17 may end up to be captured, but you should exploit its presence as much as possible!]
;W[jb]
(;B[kb]C[[R\] strong response locally, but very passive];W[ie]
;B[je]C[[R\] But this doesn't theaten White at all.
If it's for building the upper right, White's left side is MUCH bigger.

Also, again Black is responding to White (not a good thing).

All the points marked as alternatives for move 25 are still valid options!]
;W[rh]C[[R\] I would let White crawl, if he wants.
It is urgent to play on the left side!];B[rg]C[[R\] Black is responding to White (not a good thing)

Same as for move 27];W[qi]C[[R\] nobody would play this];B[nf]
C[[R\] This move feels very small.

Who has more to lose if the opponent invades? White or Black?
(answer: White. The left side is so big!)];W[rm]
(;B[rn]C[[R\] Black is responding to White.

You respond too often.


Usually the point of blocking the opponent like this, is to make the group weak, to attack (and possibly kill it).

But with the previous move, White group is alive.

You surely defend some points in the lower right corner, but this move does not have any effect on the White group!

(that's why White plays elsewhere on the next move!)];W[fq]
;B[fm];W[ib]C[Here W defends. Could I have tried to capture K18?

[R\] Yes, the White stone at K18 was possible to capture. But it's just one stone!

At the moment, on the board there are bigger things to do than capture just one stone]

(;B[jf]C[[R\] locally a good move (but a bit slow)

It's probably a good idea, since the left side is still so open, to try to make a base for the D7 group, which is floating]
;W[bm]C[[R\] Ok, White took away the possibility to make a base.

But It is still very easy for Black to reduce the left side (e.g. by playing at C8)]

(;B[kh]C[[R\] No! 

K14 is already so strong, that you can jump at H13 directly!]
;W[cl];B[hg]C[My previous move, L12, was a preparation for this kogeima at H13

[R\] Think of Go as a martial art. In a fighting, you rarely have time to prepare. 

If you are allowed to prepare, it means that probably you are planning wrong! 


Because the K14 move was so strong, you could play H13 directly!


Having played L12... I would probably play G5, and connect the D7 group]
;W[jq];B[jp];W[oi]
(;B[ho]C[I'm concern about how disconnected are my two stones at the 7 line, so I try to reach to connect.

[R\] Why not G5? It connects with only one move, as opposed to what happened in the game (H5 + H7)]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[mi]
(;B[mh]C[[R\] You respond too many times to your opponent

Every time you respond, your opponent gains a little bit

Try to think of alternatives. If White threatens to take away points from your upper group, you threaten to make more points on the lower group, e.g. with the B Q7, W Q8, B O7 sequence!]
;W[nh];B[mg];W[on]
(;B[nj]C[B O10 looked as a bad move once I made it. Alternatives?

[R\] Locally you played the correct shape.

But, White group is already too strong, at this point you cannot threaten it very much.]
;W[oj];B[li];W[nk];B[mj];W[fj];B[hm]C[As alternative to H7 I though of playing G6. Now I also see that maybe I could have pushed in the 13 line into W's moyo.

[R\] Why not F5? In case of equivalent moves, play the ones that put more pressure on your opponent.

It's correct to defend first.];W[hj]
(;B[hh]C[[R\] Why so slow and solid?
See alternatives];W[ll];B[jk];W[fg]C[In my previous move, should I have pushed into W moyo on the left instead of cutting in the center?

[R\] You are correct. It is of no use to cut two groups that are alive.]

(;B[mk]C[B N9 looks like a poor move. Alternatives?

Maybe P12?

Or maybe claim territory on the lower left?

B G3

W F2

B F4

[R\] This variant is way too small in scale!

At move 72, your opponent tries an invasion at S16, with very little space. Look how much more space there is in the upper left corner!

At this point, it is much bigger to reduce White left side. Also you can push effectively with the D7 group (e.g. B C6, W B6, B D5)]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[nl];B[nn];W[om];B[oo];W[rd]C[[R\] Take this as example of very deep invasion.

It is a good point];B[rc];W[hf];B[ln];W[ni];B[lj];W[sg];B[sf]
;W[sh];B[re];W[hs];B[is];W[gs];B[ir];W[fo];B[gj]C[[R\] good!]
;W[gk];B[gi];W[fk];B[hk];W[gl];B[gm];W[em];B[hl];W[en];B[fl]
;W[sn];B[so];W[fi];B[el];W[dl];B[ek];W[di];B[dk];W[ck];B[ej]
;W[ei];B[fn];W[go];B[eo];W[dn];B[fp];W[gp];B[gq];W[ep];B[fr]
;W[er];B[fs];W[es];B[ja]C[K19 is a 1 point reduction that would have ended in gote for B.

Now I see better moves like B G13, B R12.

But I don't see any better move.

At this point W looks very solid everywhere to me.



Maybe B L8 to secure the center?

[R\] Yes L8 or L7 

The game has already been decided. Now it's all small endgame points.

I left few comments, but at the last move, I wrote a general recommendation for your playing style.]
;W[sm];B[ro];W[km]C[Now I get a reduction at the center for not having seen this.]

Now W gets sente.];W[if];B[ig];W[mm];B[mn];W[kk];B[kj];W[jl]
;B[ik]C[I played K9 instead of K8 not to leave the posibility of an atari at L10.

[R\] L10 was nothing to worry about.
You should play like this, only if you are looking forward to a ko fight, where every threat counts!]

;W[dg];B[il];W[lk];B[tt];W[tt]C[ First of all, thank you very much for reviewing my game.

In this game I'm playing B against the program Many Faces of Go.

I'm a 10k at KGS server and have been struggling for a while without improvement.



One thing I feel I have problems with is

[R\] The last sentence was incomplete in the file I received :( 

Here are my general remarks- 

You should become more comfortable with attacking.
Try to play a few handicap games as White.

In handicap games, you are forced to recognize and exploit your opponent's groups weaknesses. And if you learn that, then you become consequently better at defending.
Again, it's not about playing more aggressively, but learning shapes and how to manage groups effectively.

If you learn to cope with cuts, then your play will become more active.

Also, in handicap games you will train yourself to take the initiative more often, and respond less to your opponent.


You are almost a one-digit kyu.
If you get better at attacking, I feel you will easily gain 3 stones!

Good luck!])
