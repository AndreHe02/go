C[Hi.
This game was a very close game, with me winning by 1.5 points. Despite
this I had the feeling that black was ahead for most of the game. So
one thing I want to ask you is if my opponent made some bad choices in
yose, or if I'm wrong and the game was pretty much even the whole time.
Another
one of my concerns is that my opponent manages to reduce territory,
which I though was fairly secure (happens in my other games too), for
example in this game, my two territories on the sides.
Finally, I
would be greatful if you include the resoning behind your comments when
you point out a bad move, or make suggestions to alternative moves.
Thank you in advance for reviewing my game for me.

Note: Moves 1-72 were on one day, and 73-244 were on the the day after. Kaister had to leave half way through for some reason.

Hi,

I
make one comment in the middle where I think the game is more or less
even with good chances for white. After that black seems ahead but he
doesn't do best in a big fight in the center, so you pull ahead. It
seems that the game swings back and forth over a couple of complicated
capturing races.

I think you both play a good game for your
rating and that you show some insight into improving your game in your
comments. Hopefully, my comments add something to your insight.

There
is one fault in your play that is hard for me to summarize. At 2 or 3
points you have some relatively weak stones and you add a move in the
area that doesn't really strengthen them and is, in fact weak itself.
If you play near your own weak stones, you would like to add  eye shape
possibility, add chances for connection, sacrifice for benefit
elsewhere, or skip lightly away with a stone that is not in jeapardy
itself.

I
think that this is not the best move. It seems to me that A would be
more severe as an attack on the w group and just as good of an
extension.
As an extension alone B-E would be bigger.];W[lc];B[mc]LB[lb:A]
TR[mc]C[Should I have resonded to this (maybe at A)? Or was tenuki a really bad idea?

As a local move A would be good, but I don't think that the tenuki is wrong.]

[ge:D]C[The
moment I played S11, I thought it should be at A. Or should I have
played in a different area of the board altogether?

I agree that
A would be better if you are going to play here. Moves elsewhere also
deserve consideration. Hard to say what is best for sure. B as a
combined extension and attack, D as a combined defense and attack, and
C come to mind.];B[rg];W[kq]LB[jq:A]C[
I like A better, but lets see what happens.];B[lq];W[hq]LB[kq:A]
[jq:B]C[
Your attacking stone at A is not as strong as it would be at B.]
;B[jp];W[jq];B[ip];W[hp];B[do]LB[co:A]C[
You
would have really liked to play here or at A to make a shimari. Even
though your responses to b's moves were natural, it might have been
better to back up and play in the corner instead.];W[co];B[cn]
;W[cp];B[en];W[ck]LB[cj:A]C[
A might be more secure, but the idea here is definitely right.]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[bm];W[no]LB[op:A][oo:B]C[
Your
later comment is right. Another way to think of it is like this: If
your move was already here and b played A, you would recognize a threat
in the peep and connect at B. You are handing b a chance to cut you
apart.];B[oo];W[nm]LB[on:A][no:B]C[I think either 38 or 40 is bad move. Or both of them.
In both cases would A have been a better response?

A
very interesting question. B was not a good move , but the game move
might tend to be able use it by threatening to escape with it.]
;B[on];W[om]LB[pn:A]C[
I like A better. The game move tends to steer b into your side territory.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[pl]C[Black has a fun time reducing my territory.]
;W[pj];B[pk];W[oh]LB[qk:A][pj:B]TR[nm][om][no]C[
A
is better; without it B is not connected and your game move is even one
step further away. The game move also has no relationship to your
triangle stones. You are accumulating weaknesses to no clear purpose.]
;B[pi];W[qj];B[oi]LB[oj:A]C[
A is better, walling off w's strong group on the side.];W[qh]
;B[qg];W[oj];B[ni];W[nj];B[mi];W[kd];B[le];W[eg]C[
This
move is big and not necessarily wrong, but you have be aware that you
pushing b into your group at the top which is weaker.];B[ge]

(;W[id]LB[lb:A][ie:B]C[
I
don't like this move. A is better at getting real security for your
group. B is better at splitting b's groups and getting into the center.
I don't think the game move really does either very well.];B[cb]
;W[bc];B[cc];W[bd]LB[dd:A][bb:B]C[
I like A as an aggressive move. You can always play here after b plays B or, if you get a chance play B yourself.]
;B[dd];W[ce];B[bk];W[bj]C[Here Kaister had to leave, the moves to follow were played out on the next day.]
;B[ak];W[aj];B[cl];W[dk];B[dl]LB[ek:A]TR[ck][dk]C[
This
seems to be one of the places where b reduced your territory. It is not
wrong to play tenuki here, but you need to realize that a hane by b at
A is going to hurt your triangle stones. There is much to gain by
playing A yourself. The longer the chain of stones the less they will
hurt by a hane at both ends.];W[in]LB[lb:A][ia:B][qq:C][kn:D]
[lk:E]TR[nm][om][no]C[
I
am not as good at evaluating the position as I should be, but I like
w's chances at this point. Your lower left and upper left offset his
big upper right. You have 2 problems: Your top is not secure (think
about b moves at A followed by a monkey jump to B to see this) and you
would like to be sure of a connection with the triangle stones without
giving b any compensating center territory. 
C is also a big move for either side.

I
think the game move would be better if it had more of a relationship
with the triangle stones and/or the protrusion of your right side
group. b's next move suggests that D might be a good point. E also
seems good to make use of your strong side group.];B[kn];W[ko]
;B[jo]LB[kp:A][kn:B]C[
This
is bad. b should secure his connection and separate your stones with A
It will then be a contest between multiple w weak stones and one b weak
stone at B. b can sacrifice, attack, or defend as seems best at that
point.];W[kp];B[jn];W[lo]C[
Your postion is now stronger and b has a heavy weak group.]
;B[mp];W[np]LB[mo:A][ln:B]C[
This
move seems wrong. Your stones are not so strong that you should be
using them to push into b's territory. A or B seem like much better
moves to strengthen your stones and hurt b's heavy stones.]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[nq];W[nn];B[lr];W[kr]LB[im:A]TR[mn][nm][nn][om]
[no][np]SQ[lo][ko][kp][kq][jq]C[
I would live a little dangerously here and attack b's weak group with A. If you did this you would need to watch your 
triangle and square groups very carefully.];B[ln]C[
Dangerous move by b. You need to be very careful.]
(;W[iq]LB[ir:A]C[
This is not the key point. If b plays here, you can play A (see alternates)]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[mk]LB[lk:D][nk:A][ll:B][mm:C][ol:E][ok:F]C[I played at A the next move.
One
of my many, not so good moments.  B probably would have been better,
right? I think it would put pressure on blacks L6 group as well.
Or is white dead unconditionally after b N9? If so what was the deciding move?

Ok,
I've come back to this part of the game and after a lot of thinking, I
came up with the variation I included, with a black reponse at C. Is
that correct, or can white survive? (Initially, when I thought of B, I
was thinking of a black reponse at D.)

Play a little further on
your line and you can win the capturing race at the expence of b's
upper right getting larger. Another possibility is to play E followed
by F to connect, but then b will save his group and probably do well in
the center.]

Is this the reduction you mention? See earlier comments.];B[fk]

(;W[jl]TR[ll][ml]LB[mj:A]C[
Maybe
this is worth a chance at this point, but I don't think that this stone
is much stronger than the triangle stones. It is a long way to connect
these to anything. A is probably a more useful move to get the "nose"
of your live side group into the center, but looking at the alternate
line I am not sure.];B[lk];W[kk];B[kj];W[jj];B[ki];W[lg];B[kg]
;W[mg]
(;B[md]LB[jg:A]C[
This is a point to watch, but I think A is better for b to strengthen his upper left.
Looking again at the alternate, the game move does prevent a scary but managable sequence.]
;W[jg];B[kh];W[fd];B[ed]LB[fe:A]C[
A better I think.]
(;W[qq]C[
big point but attacking b's upper left is probably more important. (See alternate for one line.)]
;B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[ls]LB[gh:A]C[
This
is an endgame move. You have bigger fish to fry like seeing if there is
any way to rescue your center stones. A is maybe a place to start.]

b doesn't really have to play here.];W[qc]TR[cb][cc][ec][dd]
[ed][ee][ge][gg]C[I
didn't think that that this would have much chance of working... but I
had to try something. It looked to me like black was doing pretty well.

One
thing I didn't notice at anytime during the game was that the marked
black group had yet to make 2 eyes. If I had attacked it was there a
chance of killing it?

At first I thought b should live but I
analyzed a different move order and now I think he can be killed.(see
alternates from 127) In any case, you can attack in sente with profit.]
