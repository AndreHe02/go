C[I was a bit confused in this game.
I will appreciate comments on:
-opening
- dealing with white invasion on the right side.
- best way to deal with white moyo on the left.
- tactical points, good/bad shapes.

Thanks!


Lets see what we have here.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]C[I chose chinese opening, I like to play it recently]
;W[np]LB[mp:1]C[I didn't know this move
I know approach move at 1. O4 seem not so common.
After game I looked in pro games data base and so black answers are Q5 or P5.


Yes odd, not unseen. Its usually not good to approach thickness. 

Try pincering it]
(;B[po]C[I don't know if this or P5 is better.
At any rate, both were  played in pro games.];W[kp];B[fc];W[nc]
LB[lc:4][cf:1][pf:2][qf:3]C[this move surprised me. I wished result like white 1, black K16.

What is white intention? I'm not sure.
I considered the moves 1,2,3,4

3 seem too low with respect to R9, so of 2,3, maybe 2 better.
If I play 2, I expected white to pincer at H17 and was not happy about the ressult (see variation).
if I play 1, I'm not sure what result to expect.

locally, 2 seem most  common.
however I chose 4 since it seems to coordinate with F17 stone


1 Did seem possible if you wanted a low point game.
2 and 3 passive I wouldnt recommend
4 was good, but when pincering you could had thought moves like K16 L17 or M16. M16 would probably been best]

(;B[lc];W[qc]LB[pc:A][qd:B]TR[qk]C[I blocked at A
However, maybe this was wrong direction. I now think I should have blocked at B.
although the stone R9 is maybe a little far.

This is not big, you could had played C9 earlier 

why? see variations];W[cj]C[I saw white making big moyo, so decided to invade at 3-3]

(;B[mg]TR[li]C[I think M11 is better
the important thing seem to attack the lower white group, not to block the top white group.
If I played M11, I could more easily walk inside white moyo

yep];W[li]C[T18 for ko, white has million and one ko threats but I think it might be worth something, then again maybe not losing ko means losing group below and theres nothing big enough on the board normally thats a dead shape but t15 forcing safes it]

Quality game, I would recommend to study reason behind a joseki moves, not just how to play em. Then it will be easier to counter moves that are off normal joseki. Attacking more and correct timing to reduce mojo and you are close to dan :)
