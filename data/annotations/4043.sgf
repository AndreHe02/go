C[I am ticktock (white).   My style in reviews is to go over the game myself and make assertions, so I don't ask many questions of the reviewer, because I'm never sure what the right question is :-)   You may refute or confirm my statements, or make any other general comments.

In this game I felt black made some overplays which I didn't punish correctly.   However, it is hard for me to identify exactly where this game went wrong.  Thanks in advance for your help,

Hi,

My name is Micha, I am Tobamf or LeeHungLo on KGS. I don't play too regularly, but I will do my best to answer your questions. I have 20 books on Go, so I'll try to keep my comments restricted to what books say, lest I give you some terrible advice. Take whatever I say with a grain of salt.]
;B[pp]C[Black's strength is unknown.  He is a [?\] player on KGS.  I would not be ashamed of this loss if the 4k in is user name is meaningful.]
;W[pd]C[I am white.];B[dd];W[dp]C[the 4-4 point is usually played for influence. when your stones are opposite each other,  they obviously have a different harmony than when you play both on the same side. Unfortunately, I don't play this type of opening often.]
;B[nc];W[qf];B[qc]C[The early invasion is a little unusual.

Looks like black will trade the corner and give you influence in return. In theory, this is desirable, since the 4-4 point is aimed at influence.]
;W[pc]
(;B[qd]LB[pb:A]C[This move is new to me.  Usually black plays at 'A'.

I suppose it depends on what black wants. I have included some variations here.]

(;W[qe];B[pe]C[For black to cut like this immediately seems like an overplay.  I don't think I punish it effectively, however.

See the included variations.]
(;W[oe]LB[pb:B][qb:A]C[I considered the hane at 'A', I don't think it is easy for white to capture black.  Perhaps white can get a good result anyway with 'A' or 'B'.

So, its a fundamental to keep your groups connected, which is what the P15 stone does, but if you can capture the corner, then that achieves connectedness but also gives white more points. So perhaps this is a lesson (for both of us) to know life and death well and to read it all out before playing P15 or knowing you can capture the corner.]
;B[pb]
(;W[nq];B[np]C[The attachment seems a little slack with no other stones nearby.

Usually the attachment is made to fix shape.  I think white might have considered approaching from R6 here, because it works well with the bit of thickness white has with the R14 group.]
;W[mp];B[oq];W[no];B[op];W[mo];B[pm]LB[pn:A]C['A' is more common for black, but I don't see any big problems with Black 21.  There's something a little greedy about it, but I can't put my finger on it.

Two space jump is correct here. A is too close. Generally, you can jump N+1 spaces away from your wall of length N. here the wall black has is of length 2 (the spots that are not covered by white), so he jumps 2+1 spots away.]
;W[iq]C[Notice you did the N+1 jump here with no questions asked.]
;B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq]LB[cl:A][cm:B]C[The ladder is favorable for white, so 'A' and 'B' might be feasible alternatives here.  I chose to play simply.  Perhaps this is a little slack.

playing at A forces black C3, so it's a matter of deciding what you want. I'm not very experienced with the attachment at B, it has some complicated variations. Maybe a 1d can show you some good ones for that.]
;B[bq]C[I don't think this move is so big right now.

Well, it does make black alive, although C9 is more common.]
;W[cf];B[ch];W[cc]LB[fc:A][ef:B][di:C]C[A double approach here at 'A' wouldn't be good, I think, because black has too many helping stones and the fight wouldn't be good.  Jumping at 'B' is possible, to aim at keeping black low with the press of 'C' later, but I'm not sure white's wall would be useful.

Given the situation, I think white's line of play here makes sense. Starting at F17 for example would have led to a pincer there as well.]

(;W[be]C[Maybe unnecessary.

Not needed.];B[ck];W[qk]LB[qo:B][qp:A]C[I'm not sure this move is enough right now, and it might be a bit aji keshi if white had some potential near 'A' or 'B' before.

R9 is good. works well with the R14 stones.];B[jc]
(;W[ok];B[jp]C[One gets the feeling that black is trying to bully white.

looks like a reasonable reduction to me. Black can't expect to make points like this, he is vastly outnumbered, but now is a good time to reduce white somewhere, since all the easier points on the board are taken. See the variation as one way for white to try and milk the position.]

(;W[jq]LB[ip:A]C[It seems passive white to play here now.  Maybe I should block at 'A'  instead.]

(;W[di]LB[me:A]C[I now think this move is terrible.   It is not reasonable to use it to launch a learning attack against black's group in the lower center, because that group is nearly alive.  Something near 'A' might help white build a moyo.

O8 is an annoying cut. Perhaps you should fix that area first.]

C[notice here that white now has 2 weak groups and black has 1 weak group that is getting stronger attacking both of them simultaneously. It goes to show why the answer to K4 should be the simple move of K3 - keep connected and keep black weak.

Black can win this game easily from this position.]
(;W[qi]LB[ri:A]C[Helps black.  It seems 'A' is sufficient.]
;B[qh];W[ph];B[qj];W[ri];B[rk];W[pj]C[No comment :-).];B[ql]
C[Game over now.];W[oh];B[qb]C[The game is hopeless for white now.  I am significantly behind in territory, black has no weak groups and white's M2 group does not yet have two eyes.  I resign.

Lots of lessons in this game for both of us. Thanks for sharing. :)]
