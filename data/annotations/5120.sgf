C[Hello reviewer!
Thanks for investing your time in me.

I played this game as 9k KGS and my opponent was 9k, too.
Iplay as black.

I totally lost this game. Sometimes I just misread, but perhaps you have some strategic advice for me!

I will add comments prefaced by T:];B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dd]
;B[qn]C[T: Yang usually comments that preventing a shimari is bigger than extending from a 44 point..  Probably only a small point difference tho.]
;W[jp];B[do];W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[er];B[dk]LB[ci:A][bk:B]
C[T: This should be on third line.  Now A is very good for w with B as followup]
;W[qi]LB[ci:A][cm:B][dm:C]C[T: should be at C11.  A followed by B or C is devasting so w will get this move after b defends]
;B[cf]C[T:essential];W[fd];B[ef];W[nc];B[qf];W[ql];B[lq]C[since i am usually bad at fuseki, i was quite satisfied with the result until here. do you have any proposals?

T: probably b has a small advantage in influence and in secure territory.  There is very little territory at this stage]
;W[nq]
(;B[np]C[would n4 be better here?
T: see the likely variation
This area was open to invasion so this is expected
See the variation for w]
(;W[op]C[T: an interesting line for b - P3]
(;B[mp]C[T: b should atari first at P5.  see the next variation.  This is giving w a good opportunity]

(;W[oq];B[oo];W[pq];B[qp];W[rr]LB[hp:C][hq:B][jr:A]C[T: b can take sente here.  A settles the group.C is most severe but perhaps more risky than B since the black group is not completely secure]
;B[rq];W[qq]
(;B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[rf];W[qe]
;B[pe];W[pf]C[i thought he should have protected at r16 first, and this is wouldn't be a reasonable cut, because r11 and 18 weren't strong.
but i was wrong or just played badly.];B[qh];W[of];B[pi]C[q12 better?]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[oh];B[ri];W[qj];B[rj];W[og];B[qg];W[pj];B[rl]
;W[rm];B[rk];W[qm]C[a good result for white, i think.];B[rd]
;W[qd];B[se];W[rc];B[sd];W[sf];B[sg];W[sc]
(;B[nd]C[T: What?  See variations.  The b group on side is completely secure.  Keep the 3 stones to keep the corner group insecure]
;W[sf];B[hc];W[jc]C[as white i would have protected the corner instead.

T: the w followup move is not severe as it puts no pressure on H17.  See the variations.  W has some pressure to apply to both H17 and O16 groups.  Just protecting the corner may give away too much for w.  This is not a bad move for b or for w]

(;W[kd];B[fb];W[gc];B[gb];W[db];B[cc];W[eb];B[cd];W[ib];B[gd]
;W[fc];B[hb];W[ge]C[T: the stone is not important.  You are not going to kill the w group and it doesnt affect life of b group]

(;B[he]C[h15 is not a good move, but i thought the group would be in trouble, if i played h16]
