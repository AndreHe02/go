C[sub0: Hello reviewer! My state of mind during games for couple of last months can be defined as "confused" but I'll try to explain my thinking behind moves.

Also I hope to get suggestions of what to do to impove :)

Chris: Looking over the game, it is only one third suitable for a review. the best games to submit to the gtl are games where you do not have an idea why you lost. after the overplay-invasion it was clear black is ahead by 20 minimum.
other than that i will try to shed some light on why you were behind before that. cornel has phrased KGS players as having a "helicopter style, all over the place". that is kind of true. it may be a good idea, for style purposes, to try and win games *before* the fighting sets in. it is not very easy to do, but in trying you will learn  how to take control over the board without relying on head-through-the-wall invasions.

my recommendation for improving the opening is 501 opening problems, a really good book.

if you have any further questions, feel free to contact me.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dd]C[I've seen this kind of opening in some pro games. So I try it from time to time, but I have no idea about openings and how to play any of them.]
;W[dp];B[qn];W[qf]C[Sub: I was confused here. I thought of pincer.

Chris: Pincer is indeed the correct direction. fortunately for black though, white did not punish blacks passivity.]

(;B[qd]
(;W[qi];B[qk]C[Chris: correct.];W[nq];B[rp];W[of]
(;B[nd]C[Chris: Unnecessary. Blacks corner is safe. OTOH whites corner on the bottom is usettled. black should seek to punish white.]
;W[qq]C[Sub0: where to play now? I don't know. Looks like R14 is weak but I don't know how to attack it.]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[jp];B[cq]C[Sub: didn't know where to play so played here.
Chris: Correct the corner is very big.];W[cl]
(;B[en]LB[bo:A]C[Sub0: I wonder if this is correct...
Chris: Need to play more solidly. There is a big weakness at A.]

(;W[co];B[bo];W[dn];B[dm];W[do];B[cm]C[Chris: White helped black *a lot* here.]
;W[em];B[fn];W[dl]C[Chris: This is a good move.]
(;B[el]TR[en][fn]C[Sub0: Guess this was game losing sequence ...
Chris: Hardcore-overplay. you help white by weakening the marked group]
;W[fm];B[ek];W[gm]C[Chris: The beforementioned "helicopter-style".]
;B[ck];W[bl];B[bm];W[dk];B[dj];W[dq];B[bk];W[fc];B[ec]C[Sub0: Here I wanted to get big left side. I wonder if that was right idea ...]
;W[fd];B[df];W[jc]
(;B[eb]C[Sub0: I didn't know where to play now so played this move...
Chris: Inhibit white developing the centre. if white invades the corner his outside will suffer.]

(;W[qo];B[ro];W[pn];B[qm]C[Chris: White is pushing from behind. Black is happy to get cash and become very solid.]
;W[pm];B[lc]LB[pl:A][pg:B]C[Sub0: Yeah.. Guess Q8 was right.
Chris: A is the vital point. if black A, the attack at B becomes very severe.]
;W[jf];B[ff];W[ql];B[rl];W[pl];B[jr]C[Sub0: lower side became really big so I wanted to do something about it. So I played here. Move like most of my moves: "lets play here and watch maybe something good will happen out of this"

Chris: Overplay. more important to make sure there is no need for such a wild invasion.]

(;W[jq];B[ir]LB[go:A]C[Chris: But white made the capital mistake of not pushing black against his strength. rather white helped black in pushing him towards his only weakness aroun A...
