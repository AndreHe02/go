C[Hello,
I'm Manuel, Manueler 8k in KGS I don't play 13x13 go much, but I'll try my best here.]
;B[kc]C[Placed some comments, but if you have the time, we would like to have a complete review. Thx in advance]
;W[cj];B[cd];W[jk]
(;B[kh]TR[kh]C[Usually when the  approach at triangle is used when black wants to avoid a pincer, but given that it is a 13x13 game AND that your first move was a 3-3 then I would rather approach at circle. See variation]
;W[ki];B[ji];W[kj];B[ij]TR[jg]SQ[jh]C[Triangle or square is the usual move here. As you saw the cut at k6 is a painful one]
;W[jh];B[ih]TR[jg]C[this looks like the wrong side to give atari. I would play triangle here. Anyways, the situation is a bad one for black vbecause of his overplay so I don't think that there can be a fair result for black after the white cut.]
;W[jg];B[kg];W[ec]C[The right side is more important, it's the struggle to get ahead and white just handed black 2 plays in a row. And yes, e11 is a ladder breaker, but why let black get an atari at k8?]

(;B[fc]TR[fc]C[I this a correct move in or should i play somewhere else?
