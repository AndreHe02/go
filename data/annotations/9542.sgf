C[Dear reviewer, thank you for taking your time to have a look at this game.

I played this game as white on wbaduk's "Korea 1" server. In the Fuseki I got behind early, probably because I tenukied too early from a Joseki. Later, I did not find the right points or right timing for invading the large black frameworks.

Any criticism and suggestions are highly appreciated.

B: Hi Andre8s, good game. The major issues are the amount of moves spent on the center left and the bottom right without achieving any points; that let B build up large territory in the top and on the bottom center. The game seemed to go very peacefully, so I will focus on the positional judgment issues. There was some interesting life and death on left side, but it's too complicated for even me (~2d strength) to come to solid conclusions, so don't worry about it.



I'll prefix my comments with "B:"];B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[od]
;W[pf];B[qc];W[rc];B[pc];W[rb]TR[qe]C[B: This W move is typically played when you want to attack the top B group. It has a weakness at the marked point so be careful. If you don't want to deal with that weakness, play S15 instead.]

(;W[qn]C[Mistake, I shouldn't tenuki the upper group

B: Could be worse.];B[ql]

(;B[oq]C[In wbaduk's DDK zone this move is played in 99% of the cases...

B: It's a bad move. B could use this aji in other ways (at M3, for example). It's a pure waste of aji.]
;W[or];B[mp]
(;W[np]C[B: You are losing liberties and opening up the danger of your cutting point at O2 this way.]
;B[no];W[mq];B[lp];W[lq];B[kp];W[oj]LB[ph:B][dj:A]C[I would like to rather play a big move at A but still have to protect against an invasion at B --> Probably all a result from my joseki deviation.

B: Yes, it is unfortunate to have to play another move here. Not so bad in this case because if B plays at P10, could build up big moyo with wall on bottom.]

B: This move is made more severe because of lack of liberties for N3.

I would honestly just leave this alone and take sente. Even with B M2, the worst you get is a dumpling - just a few points worse than playing out the next few moves. Contrast B's thickness with if you hadn't provoked O4.]
;W[kr]C[B: This move, followed by the hane-connect at K1 just made B even thicker and reduced your chances of invading the 3-3 point successfully.]
;B[jr];W[lr];B[ch]C[B: Nice invasion point by B. It's hard to deal with this, unfortunately.]

B: Actually, very good move - expand your territory and shrink B's at same time. Would probably be better at O14 though.]
