I'll do what I can. I'm only about 8-9k myself (KGS), but I'll give you whatever advice I can. Hope it helps.

All the best,

- So it was a good game by both sides. Some general tips:

- White should try not to always follow his opponent around the board. Throughout the game it was almost always Black who directed play. Consider playing more agressively.

- Try to identify the small moves your opponent makes, moves you needn't respond to so that you can make big moves elsewhere.

- White defended well, but not quite well enough. A better job with the C6 group or the H16 group and the game would have been White's. "Divide and conquer."

- Let me know if you have any questions. Perhaps we can meet online someday too (jesssster on KGS)

- Keep up the good Go! Play as much as you can, study a bit, review your games, have them reviewed, learn from your mistakes and most of all have fun!

May the force be with you,
