C[Hello, I am a beginner and I mostly play against computer and sometimes in KGS where I am around 20 kyu.

I play this game against a computer named Leela and his level was 17 kyu.

Hi. I am Radu. I am playing mostly on little golem, where I am now around 7 kyu.
I will try to point to you the most important aspects in this game. I will use the prefix "R:"]
;B[jj];W[kg]C[R: is it a computer? Strange opening. Go for corners.]

(;B[dj]C[R: I would play C10. See a variant on a usual follow up and the advantages.]
;W[fk];B[hk]C[R: good. Another option would be tenuki (C10)]
;W[gj];B[ek];W[el];B[dl];W[ej];B[dk];W[ei];B[ch]C[R: good timing]
;W[dg];B[dd]C[R: in this moment I would go for K10. The left corner is already under W influence, while the right corner is virtualy empty. An attack there will be sever on the L7 stone, while D10 is already approached by W.]
;W[cg];B[bh]C[R: corners! There is one free. You can afford loosing the C6 stone: how much does W gain? Your left corner group should still survive. But the right corner now is valuing around 30 points.]
;W[fl]
(;B[hl]C[R: right corner. It is more important.];W[bg];B[jd]
C[R: yeap!];W[ie]
(;B[ig]TR[ie][kg][jf]C[R: what is the purpose of this move? It is not an extension from the bottom group, as already W has L7, it caps but very weak L7 (W has K8). 
I would have go with K8 as attack or K9 for safety; aiming to cut the 2 stones and put pressure on one of them. See variant]
;W[je]C[R: W good move: attack both K10 and J7. B can choose between defending the corner and up side or maintaining the invader in the center.]
;B[id]C[R: side be it. J7 should now be considered dead but a very valuable stone to use on building the moyos. Esp thinking of the right down corner: L6 is a powerful move.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[gd]CR[gc]C[R: hmmm, W already is behind, I would have double hane]
;B[gc];W[fc];B[fd]C[R: good. W decides; loose the 2 stones at G10 or F11. Myt personal choice: F9.]
;W[ed];B[fe]CR[gd][hd]C[R: W decided loose marked. It is wrong decision: now J7 can come to life]
;W[gf]CR[ee]C[R: this is an example of "undecided" play. W started something, gave up and come back. B E9 is attacking, E11 is safer.]

(;B[ec];W[dc];B[eb];W[ic]C[R: kind of useless. But never know when an aji like F11 or J11 will be put to work. W has to get out with C10 and the corner is white.]
;B[jc];W[ke];B[kd];W[ff]CR[cd]C[R: this is B chance to keep the left corner too!]
;B[ee]C[R: good];W[de];B[cd]C[R: good move];W[ib]
(;B[jb]C[R: this could be somewhere else. A tenuki can be played. But to avoid complications, esp. thinking that B is well ahead, yes, this is working ok.]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[fa];B[ea];W[be];B[ce]C[R: wrong direction, W can invade the corner.]

(;W[df]C[R: wrong move];B[bd]C[R: good];W[cf];B[ae]C[R: small move. The right down area is much more on fire.]
;W[ad];B[ac]TR[be]C[R: Could instead capture second line stone]
;W[ki]CR[lj][kk]C[R: this is good direction of attack. I would have it deeper in B territory. A safe invasion would be M4, while a bold one L3 (but with good chances)]
;B[kj];W[ji];B[hi]TR[ig]C[I think I made a mistake here.
I thnik J5 is a better move to invade white's territory.
I guess I lost the game because of its move.
R: Marked stone is lost. But it can be used to close the moyo. So yes, J5 would work just fine as in sequence in variation. But I totally disagree that this move looses the game. Let's do some math:
B has 36 points in top, 15 points in left corner and 15 points in right corner plus 2 prisoners = 68 points
W has 34 points in center and komi = 40.5 points. So no, I would say W shoud resign now, B is so ahead.]
;W[hj];B[ij]CR[ii]TR[hi][ig]C[R: B could try a capture by playing J5 and doing a fighting formation with marked stones, but being lot ahead it is not mandatory. Just close the territory. Good.]
;W[ii];B[gl]CR[lj][ld][ef]SQ[ah][dh][ge][le][li][dm]TR[bf][ed]
[di]C[R: try in the yose (end stage of game) to play in order
- sente moves, these are forcing the opponents to reply and defend, otherwise the looses would be too big
- gote ending moves but producing lot of gain.
As a starting rule, on the start of yose every move should value 5 points, leaving the 1 point moves for the end of yose.
B move is a 1 point worth move! Why doing it when bigger moves are on table? I marked with circle the big points (sente moves or producing at least 5 points), with rectangle the medium and with triangle the minor points.]
;W[af]C[R: B can easily ignore and go for bigger points];B[bf]
;W[ag];B[be];W[li]C[R: W takes on sente end move];B[lj];W[ld]
C[R: W takes second big move, should be gote];B[lc];W[le];B[md]
C[R: this is another 1 point move. Go for bigger moves.];W[ef]
C[R: like this :)];B[ge]C[R: wrong move: B looses again sente for only 1 point]
;W[he];B[ed];W[ja];B[ka];W[hb];B[ga];W[fb];B[ia]TR[mj][di][ah]
C[R: why? after W gave 1 point free, B feels pity and give it back :) No, this move is not needed and B looses one point by playing in its own territory. Big points marked with triangles]
;W[kb];B[mi]C[R: good!]
(;W[lg];B[mh];W[gi]C[R: W is loosing another 1 point. Plus sente]
;B[lh];W[kh];B[mg];W[lf]C[R: hey, W should close the invasion, no dance around it]
;B[mf];W[me];B[mj]C[R: And so B steal at least 10 points for nothing. See variant at move 89.
So in this moment B has around 69 points, while W has 28!];W[jl]
C[Here, I thought my territory was safe but it doesn't. I don't understand why.
R: It is rock solid. This invasion should be doomed.]
(;B[ik]C[R: that cut is not scary... But still B survives];W[ll]

(;B[ml]SQ[kk]CR[kl]C[R: hmmm, not sure about this way: W is able to do a fighting formation with L3 because L2 becomes an eye and also B space is exhausted]

(;W[lm]C[R: W misses the opportunity?]
(;B[kk]C[R: hmmm, now B is in great troubles];W[kl];B[il];W[jm]
;B[im];W[gm]C[R: B is dead]
(;B[mk];W[gk];B[mm];W[fm]
(;B[jk]C[This move kills black stones, no ?

Without this move there is live in seki, maybe !?
R: no, B is dead for several moves already. W has an eye, B doesn't.]
;W[hm];B[dm]C[R: B should count again.
B has 54 points
W has 63 points
The fight in right down corner swapped entirely the situation.
I don't see ajis in the W formation];W[dh];B[di]CR[ci]TR[ah]
C[R: wrong. correct link is circle, as it defends the invasion on low]
;W[ah]
(;B[ai]C[Big mistake, but I don't know where to play, maybe B4 ?
R: as you can see in the variations, this looks worse as B4, still B should survive]

(;W[bi];B[ci];W[bj]
(;B[tt]C[I gave up ...
R: Until move  67 W played very poorly while B play was quite strong and fair. Up to that move I would say B deserves to win by far. 
Following moves up to 99 show an obvious but easy to remedy lack of yose tactics. You only need to learn about ending moves and lot of good things gonna happen. Start with http://senseis.xmp.net/?Endgame
The result is not fair, as the last fight was only a reading error. You need to learn to master these readings. Look after and read everything you can about tesuji. This should be your command: how I find the tesuji?]
