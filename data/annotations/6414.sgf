C[Hi. I played black this game on KGS. I think I won the game and because of this my opponent left the game.
But I think, I won only by miracle. And at some moment I was thinking, that I lost the center group and the game.

Could you give me some advises about attacking the white at right side? Espesially at bottom side.

Thank you.

[ZD\] Hi, I will mark my comments this way.];B[pd];W[cp];B[qp]
;W[dd];B[oq];W[nc];B[nd]LB[nc:A][nd:B][pj:C]C[Unexpected move by White. Normal moves are around q9. So I decide to bild the wall towards my simari.

[ZD\] A looks quite normal (q9 is also possible, but I would not dare to say which one is better).  Answering with B seems a bit dubious to me -- this move is usually used when black already has a stone around C.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[kc];B[qj]LB[od:A][qg:B]C[[ZD\] Leaving the cut at A may turn out problematic later.  At the very least, it will be quite difficult to make any territory around B.]
;W[ep];B[dj]LB[cj:A][dj:B]C[[ZD\] A would be better -- with a high move of B, your group will lack a base and it will be easier to attack.]

(;W[jq];B[cf];W[ce]LB[fd:A][ch:B]C[[ZD\] A mistake from white, strenghtening your group.  A, leaving a possibility of attack at B, would be better.]
;B[df];W[fe]LB[fc:C][ed:B][fe:A][nj:D][oj:E]C[This move is too high, so I decide to make an ivasion next move. Is there any others urgent or big moves on board? Will o10 be better?

[ZD\] A is definitely a mistake, leaving the weakness at B. It might even be feasible to play at B directly.  Your move at C is also ok. Both of these moves are more urgent than D (which would IMHO be better placed at E), as white still has moves to reduce the right side.]

(;B[fc];W[hd]LB[ed:A]C[[ZD\] You might also fight with A.]
(;B[cc];W[dc]LB[db:A]C[[ZD\] Playing A now would be easier.]

(;B[be]LB[bd:A]C[[ZD\] A is probably better answer for white.]

;W[ca];B[ee];W[gb]C[[ZD\] good, white lost a lot here.];B[dn]
LB[cl:D][dl:B][cm:C][bn:A]C[When I started to review -- I think it's some kind akward move. It's purpose was to help upper left group and suppress the white simari

[ZD\] Your upper left group is very strong now so there is no need to help it.  However, playing in this area is ok, as as white would very much like to get D.  Given that white has choice of A or B, this particular move does not seem good, though.  C looks like a better idea.]
;W[fn];B[dq];W[dp];B[cq];W[er];B[eq];W[fq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[fr];B[bs]LB[dn:A]C[[ZD\] If you felt that you need to help your upper left group, then playing like this and giving white the wall is inconsistent (also, A now looks quite bad).]
;W[ap]C[[ZD\] White should not play these moves just now.];B[aq]
;W[ds];B[cs];W[qh];B[oj]LB[qf:A][oh:B][oj:C]C[I think it's the best move in this situation -- helps my simari on bottom right and attack the white stone. Is there other possibility?

[ZD\] I would consider playing A to protect the cut first.  White B, black C can be expected then.]

(;W[oh];B[pg];W[ph]
(;B[lq]LB[ni:A][mj:B][oo:C]C[Should I continue the attack? I thinks that while white will be running for life, I'll build the moyo on bottom. Or may be I should go more close -- r13 or q7?

[ZD\] You might consider A (something like the variation) and try to kill (but that is a dangerous plan, not to be attempted unless you are sure you are losing otherwise).  Other than that, I do not see a useful attack on white group just now -- B to build your position in lower right is possible, but white may reduce with C.  R13 is too small, as white has the continuation showed in another variation.  Q7 looks inefficient.]
;W[rf];B[mc];W[mb];B[me];W[ld];B[qg];W[rg];B[ri];W[rh];B[qe]
;W[rd];B[re];W[se];B[sf];W[sg];B[rc];W[qf]C[[ZD\] This push is a mistake -- white loses a liberty and gains nothing.]
;B[pf];W[qm]LB[ni:C][pl:A][om:B]C[I do really don't know how to attack this stone. I don't like p7 because of white q9. Later I discover that q9 isn't very dangerouse for me. What will be the right attacking move for this stone?

[ZD\] I would consider ignoring this and killing the white group with C.  B looks natural, and q9 does not really do much.]

(;B[pl];W[pn];B[qo];W[nn];B[om]C[[ZD\] This move is not necessary.]
;W[on];B[ln];W[mm];B[mn]C[[ZD\] This push is a mistake, strenghtening white.]
;W[nm];B[mj]LB[ni:A]C[[ZD\] A to kill the upper right group would be dangerous now, as you strenghtened the lower right group, making the arising cuts problematic.  So this move is OK.]
;W[mh];B[ll]LB[lm:A]C[[ZD\] This is overplay, leaving too many cuts. A is better.]
;W[lm];B[km]C[Or should I let white go in the center and build the territory at bottom?

[ZD\] No, given that there is no way how you could build any territory on bottom.]

(;W[np];B[ko]C[Was this move a mistake? Because white now have l8 and k7 sente moves, when they block my center group with one eye. But this move helps the m3 stone.

[ZD\] Allowing white to cut would be too bad now; since the corner is alive, this move seems reasonable.]

;W[hm];B[jr];W[ki]LB[pd:A]C[At this move I felt as I completely lost the control over situation.

[ZD\] Why? Worst-case, you have enough liberties to capture the white group.  The situation might be getting a bit dangerous for the group A, though.]

(;B[ni]C[Was there any other way to survive or run the r10 group, other than in the game?

[ZD\] This push strenghtens white and removes one of your liberties.  A mistake.]

;B[do]C[I think that the game was over. At this ko threat I was hoping, that if I have left side, the game will be even. But as I undestand, if white will take the center group -- the game will be over. So should white respond on this ko threat or not?

[ZD\] Since white would clearly lead by more than 20 points even if you manged to secure the whole left side, answering this threat is pointless for him.]
