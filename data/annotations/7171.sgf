C[naho [5k\]: hi
Spandexman [5k?\]: Hello!

Hello, I'm not really 5k, more like 6/7 on KGS, but hadn't played online in a couple of months so rank was questionaby raised, and I felt like he was dominating the game up until I won :-) You'll see what I mean when you watch the game. Essentially, I'd just like some tips on the questions, and also when I played weak moves WITHOUT realising if you could point it out I'd be very grateful! Oh, I'm Spandexman, and I'm black]

C[Is this inferior for black?];W[qc];B[qe];W[rc];B[qj];W[nq]
;B[lq]SQ[qn]C[I'm not sure I like the idea.
If white gets into the corner, you will have to close either side, and the overall position is not the best for black.

I' go for the simpler R6, to combine with R6, and keep sente]
;W[qq]
(;B[qp]TR[qj]C[this is not the best, because R10 is low.];W[rp]
LB[pq:A]C[I guess this isn't reasonabe, but not really sure how to punish, maybe A?

Your move is ok. It will end up with the joseki.

However, a tewari variation (previous move) shows you that s4 is a BAD move, that you can punish with A.]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[pq];B[op];W[np]SQ[mr]MA[or]C[I don't like this. It leaves bad aji at P2, but it is joseki]
;B[no]
(;W[cn]C[joseki is at N5.
Later in the game, black N5 will be very bad for white (absolute sente because of P2, and closing white in)]

(;B[fq]C[Here I dissagree.
You went for the center with the previous joseki.

Why don't you follow your idea and leave the corner to white ?

All the more, the bottom side has very little value now : white can settle at L3 any time.]
;W[dj];B[fc]C[ok];W[jd]C[I felt this corner went poorly for me, but I thought I should jump out as otherwise he gets large influence on the top and right.

Correct for me.];B[fe];W[df];B[cb]C[I thought I'd try this :-)

Hmmm. white will separate at D17. I'm not sure I like this]

Of course :-)];W[mj];B[lk];W[nh];B[ng];W[lh];B[mh];W[mi];B[lj]
;W[li];B[gn]SQ[kf]C[Was this too territorial?

No, it's ok with me.

A possibility is to continue pressing the white center group with a move at L14]

you cannot build thickness in front of the white pmarked stones, your thickness would be wasted !]

C[Too small?

yes.];W[lm];B[ml]C[Was this too ambitious? If I fail to kill, he's running right through my territory, and i'm thin to the left.

No, it's the only idea here ...
You are late on territory, so you MUST press white];W[nn];B[mn]

It's difficult. I explored some possibilities, but not all.
but this seems correct to me]

;W[pi];B[qi]C[good game.

You managed to win a game in which you were behind.

This shows you an important thing : the essence of Go is NOT territory. 
It's the attack ...

Territorry becomes then a 'by product' (it comes along with ...)

HOWEVER !!!

don't think of turning your gamles into bersek attacking. What you did here was the correct spirit : use you strength in order to make attack successful.

Enjoy playing.])
