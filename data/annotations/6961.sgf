Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for your review. I played black in this game. There was only .5 point komi, so I won this game, but just barely. However, it was one of those cases, where I felt I was ahead, and then, suddenly, I wasn't.

Any insights into what went wrong would be helpful.

Thank you,

-Dave Felcan (FindYoda)

artca 2k : Hi!
 FindYoda 3k+: hello

BB: This is the second game of yours I've reviewed so I'm going to start with a list of the major points from the last one (review 6244). I do this without looking at the current game at all at this stage:
- You tried too hard to create a moyo but ended in gote so it got invaded before it was completed (solid connection on the right side, allowing an invasion at the bottom)
- You took gote to separate two groups that in fact could not connect (at the bottom)
- You showed a lack of willingness to make a large-scale strategic attack on a weak group (two stones at the bottom) when there was no clear way to kill (the idea would have been to make territory while attacking)
You also made many good moves, but they have less to do with me :)]
;B[cp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[fq]C[*************
I have been trying this opening lately. Usually white comes in at D10 or C10. Then the extension to c7 or c8 is better than if the f3 stone is at e3 - less concentrated (I think). See variation.

BB: Hmm, I don't know. Obviously, this move tries to make more territory than e3. And obviously, it is thinner. The shimari with e3 really dominates the left side, and this one slightly less so. The weakness of this shimari is d3, and White can actually invade there later, especially if there is a white stone on the bottom side to run to.

If you want to be efficient on the left side, your extension would be at c10 or d10. However, I'm guessing you don't get that chance.]

(;W[kq]C[***************

It seems this is wrong, as the top or either side is bigger.

***************

BB: Absolutely, positively. This is a bad move.];B[dj]C[BB: Okay, this is truly great for you. You are winning right now. This stone works perfectly for you, with your somewhat thin encolsure in the corner. One thing to note right now is that White h3 / Black j3 is starting to look like double sente, because the extension by either player has a follow-up invasion. This should be part of your thinking right now.]
;W[hq]C[***********************

Again, this seems too small and the side or top seems bigger.

BB: Yes, I think it's slightly too early, but not by much. Are you going to ignore it and left White steal your corner with d3?]
;B[qm]C[BB: Okay you are. Still, this gives White the chance to settle here in sente, and dive in to d3.

By the way, why so far from White? I think if he plays r5 here, he gets a big corner and you're still not safe. See var.]

(;W[qk]C[BB: White is offering you the corner. I think you should take it, with r3. See var.]

(;B[nc]C[BB: See var.];W[ok]C[BB: This is just plain odd. What is it trying to achieve? o17 is making it hard to get territory above, and the corner below is wide open.

Your next move has to be to invade the corner. If you think of it as trying to save r7, White will get a lot of territory and strength and you will live small or run away.]
;B[qf]C[BB: It just gets weirder. I assume you're sacrificing r7. But it won't work so well. q16 will take a lot of killing. This move certainly doesn't do it. White has support at p9/r9 too. But r7 doesn't take a lot of killing. r5 might do it.

But that's just half of it. Look how big your territory will be if you take the top right. Compare that to the bottom right if White wins it.]
;W[oe]C[BB: This is just great for White. You've got two weak groups now. Maybe three. White's not really weak anywhere.

I think your best bet here is r11, because it makes a bit of a group, and at the same time threatens to connect to r7.]
;B[rd]C[BB: I know what you're gettin at here - you're threatening to take the corner. It's not bad. If White r17 next, your r11 is quite good. But it doesn't make a base in itself, nor any territory. And White can just play elsewhere now.]
;W[on]C[************

At the time this seemed odd to me as the corner was still invadeable at 3-3. However, the bottom territory is large as result of such an invasion, so looking back I see this was white's plan all along.

********************

BB: Nice idea, wrong move. You can take the corner, possibly in sente. If there's tettitory to the left of p6 and above l3, it will be *very* easy to reduce from the outside. What White should do is play r5. It protects the corner and practically captures r7. White would be very happy for Black to start throwing good stones after bad with p7 (White could simply reply at o4).]
;B[qq]C[BB: Perfect. Where is White's territory now?]
(;W[pq]C[BB: I think I'd block on the other side. If r7, the White stones around there will be weak.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[qo];W[pm]C[BB: White should actually play elsewhere here. This move is gote. You can play r17 now, and have four corners, strong groups, and leave White with *very* little.

Finding these opportunities to take sente, and crystalise your advantage, are incredibly important for winning Go.]

(;B[pr];W[or]
(;B[qr]C[BB: Gote. Black should leave this and play r17. See var.]

(;W[ql]C[BB: Gote. White should play elsewhere. See var.]
(;B[rm]C[BB: Gote. Black should play elsewhere. See var.];W[go]
C[**************

While the bottom is large, its all white has - I feel I am ahead. Is this a correct assesment?

I think the next move is a mistake. I should have played E5.

BB: White takes sente. I'll take a punt and say this is the winning move. It's not a great move locally, but *it's not in the lower right corner*, and that's probably all that matters.]
;B[jm]C[BB: This is okay. You should probe at o2 at some stage.]
;W[md]C[*****************
I knew white was building up a large center, but I felt this was a bit difficult for him.

To reduce targets of attack, I secured the right hand group with R17, which also threatens to connect the O17 stone- rather large I thought. However, this allows possiblities in the lower left.

BB: I think your response to this is okay. If White plays r17 now, it gets hard for you.]
;B[qc];W[pc]C[BB: This is gote. White should treat his stones here lightly. They're not going to die!]
;B[jc]C[***********
Sacrifice O17 for side territory. But white didn't do this.

BB: Consider g7 instead. Because White g7 is a really interesting move.]

(;W[co]C[BB: Hmm, White should really play g7. Attack Black k7, and at the same time make strength with which to attack the left. See variation.]
;B[dp]C[BB: Good! A nice solid, simplifying move. The corner is strong now.]
;W[cl]C[BB: Kind of pointless. White could try something like j8.]
;B[cj];W[bo];B[bp];W[gl]C[***************

This invasion worked very well for white. Anything I should have done differently to respond? As I mentioned before, I should have moved out at E5 earlier.

**********

BB: No it didn't. Those three stones could still die. And by getting in there, White has given away territory both above and below.]

(;B[jj]C[***************
I felt trying to cut off the left stones rather than helping in the center would have given white too big an area. Is this correct?

BB: I'd probe at o2 first. See var.

But yes, you're right to save k7. If White plays k9, it would be very big.]
;W[gj];B[jp]C[****************
Goal here is to live locally while reducing white's gains here. I mostly succeeded, so I'm surprised at how close the game becomes.]
;W[jq];B[ip]C[BB: This isn't a light move. Try h4 instead.]
;W[hp];B[hn];W[gn]
(;B[hm]C[BB: Too small. Something like n5 increases your eye space and reduces at the same time. The move played helps White get stronger. You don't really have to take gote to live here anyway. You can still run. See var.]
;W[el]C[*************
Perhaps Black should have played around C14 instead of pushing at L4? - The invasion was bad here.

************];B[kp]C[BB: This move just doesn't do anything. It doesn't really threatening anything, nor particularly strengthen Black.]
;W[gr];B[fr];W[cf]C[*******************
This was well timed by white.

******************

BB: You made it pretty easy for him.]
(;B[ef]C[***********************

Fearing for my two stones, which if captured would give White the left side, I try reach out to them and develop the top at the same time. This result turned out poorly for me.

*******************

BB: This doesn't save them. If White wants them, he'll paly something like e13 here. See variation on next move.

Try d13 instead. See var.];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[bd];B[be]

(;B[gd]C[BB: Try h17 instead. You're strong, White is strong. Help out o17 and k17 instead.]
;W[gc]C[******************
While the left became territory for me, white's top is almost as big, and considering the advantage I had here, this is a loss. The K17 stone is also in danger.]

(;B[lq]C[*************
I am still uncomfortable with the center situation, and seek to secure these stones in sente, or at least so white pays a price.
*********

BB: You need to be more comfortable with being uncomfortable. But you can probably get something here anyway. Try n4. See var. Actually, just play n17. It's huge.]

C[***********
Center is Ok now. This move is big for me, helps make some territory up top and attacks the top white group (though not very strongly).

***********

BB: Centre is no better than before. A move like m7 is still painful. And you gave away points, and aji. But n17 is very good. You won because you got this point.]

Mistake? I was worried about the life of the M17 group. But It seems to be rich in alternatives.

BB: Yeah, it's a mistake. Don't fool yourself into thinking it's sente. You're safe, but even if you weren't, a move like k12 would do a lot more for you. And yeah, in terms of big, r12 is great.]

This begins a long fight for center territory for both of us. I got more than I thought here, and while white get some good area, considering his initial investment, it is not much.

Thank you for your comments.

Reviewing the game to prepare for comments makes me realize that white's invasions were more damaging than I had given credit for. The top left corner is quite big. White's left side was very comfortable for him. And my "destruction" in the center was not as dramatic as I had thought - white came away with 31 points and I got 13.

Need to give white more credit, I guess...
************************

BB: When people make weak moves in the opening like l3, you've gotta figure the other guy's got something up his sleeve to make up for it later. For White here, I think it was treating the stone in the top right lightly, which made a great difference.

Okay, so your biggest mistake was taking gote in the bottom right. This is the easiest thing to fix in your game.

r14 was also a big mistake, creating a weak group when you already had one.

And with your center group, you played close moves to make small eyes when in fact there was a lot of space above and to the right that you could expand or run in to instead.]

(;W[dj];B[dl];W[cg]C[Something like this development seems likely.

C8 seems threatening to the white group, while securing the corner for Black.

The corner may be invadeable, but it will be very small or white will have to run out.

Is this a valid fuskei assesment?

BB: No. D8 plays on the wrong side - it is near your stronger (two) stones and pushes White toward your weaker one. c13 is also not good for White, it should be c14 or even f17. The c10 / d8 exchange is actually good for White, and so d10 has done its work, is still light, and so can be left for now (treaded lightly). As played, there is awful weakness at c11 which, if it weren't for the weak black corner stone, Black could jump in to right now.

Instead, you should attack from above to strengthen your position and push White towards your strength, which is in the bottom left corner. It would be nicer if f3 was at e3 though :)

Yes, a White invasion in the bottom left will be small, but in the endgame it will be huge (compared to the other moves around). The other way to look at it is that an extension to j3 or so will be sente later on.]
