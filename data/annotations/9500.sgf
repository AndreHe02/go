C[Kirsten: Hi Paco, I've watched over the game and will try to give you some ideas how to handle moyos, about timing and possible moves. And what else comes to my mind regarding some moves. Please enjoy.

LB[fe:D][cn:A][fq:B][lq:C]C[Your next move (Q6) is much too slow. You're still in fuseki, where you should not make moves giving you 5-10 points of territory. 
You have settled Q4 with the response on R6, so this part is finished for now. You have no weak groups where you have to do urgent moves, so you can look out for big moves. Depending on style, I think one of the marked places is appropriate.]
;B[pl];W[dn];B[fq]C[now, this invasion is much easier to handle for your opponent. Maybe it's easier to try D3 or D2 instead.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[hq];B[hp];W[ip];B[ho];W[fn];B[in];W[kn];B[gn]
;W[fm];B[fo];W[fe]C[the next move (G16) is big, but a little slow again. I would prefer to do something on the left side. If W invades at H17, you can still fight or take the corner. 
And F15 is not a really good preparation for the invasion, it's a moyo building move. So better reduce the moyo.]

(;B[gd];W[ge];B[hk]C[right area, but a bit too soft. Even if W just defends he gets pretty much.]

(;W[hl]
(;B[hm]C[I think hane is better here. H8 looks like overplay to me.]
;W[il];B[jm];W[jn];B[im];W[gk];B[gm];W[gl]
(;B[gi]C[now you see the urgency to do something about the moyo. But the last moves helped W to improve the moyo. J9 became too weak.]

(;B[cc]C[unfortunately this will weaken your upper side, making G16 almost useless. I would like it peaceful here.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[be];W[bf];B[ce];W[de];B[cd]
LB[hc:B][ic:A]C[now the upper side is open for an invasion.]
;W[qj];B[ri];W[oj];B[nk]C[this move says you want to kill. it's game deciding, if you don't succeed, you will lose. Better avoid coming into a situation like that. 
It's much different from attacks in the beginning where you hunt your opponent keeping him from making eyes. You make profit in other parts of the board then. But here you will lose even more, if W manages to live.]

(;B[mi]C[now the decision is made, you have to try harder and even more risky moves like this. O13 is a defending move granting W more options. It's kill or lose, all or nothing, so don't worry about him sneaking into your upper side.]

(;B[fj]C[try to play somewhere on the imaginary line that defines the moyo. Such  move is always hard to handle. Playing below is usually too submissive, the moyo vanishes, just some territory remains. playing atop leads to a fight, but a stone like F10 will find a way out.]
;W[hj]LB[fg:F][fh:C][gh:B][hi:E][gk:A][hk:D]C[endless possibilities to continue. Try to take care, that W's attacking moves don't benefit him too much in other parts of the board, like creating new weak groups on your side.]
