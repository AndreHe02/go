C[Reviewer:  Shaydwyrm 1d

I've commented on a number of key points in the game itself; my comments are marked "Rev:".  The biggest issues you should pay attention to are when to tenuki (ignore a local move and play elsewhere), and issues of direction.  Also, you can probably get quite a bit stronger just by improving your reading.  I don't know what the time constraints were at each move, but you played out several sequences that clearly led to your stones getting captured.  If you can avoid playing those out, and just lose one stone, you can keep the board more open, and use more aji later in the game.

Please let me know if anything is unclear.




Dear Reviewer,

I was Black in this game.

I know I have made many mistakes
& my opponent either.

I think I haven't use correctly power (influence)
of my stones. Please tell my why?

For example:

How should I (better then I done) response on white move #74?
(to use my hudge wall on the right site)

Regards,
enigm4 (5k KGS)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[pj];W[ec];B[jc]C[Rev:  From the standpoint of direction of play, the bottom side is bigger.  This is for two reasons.  First of all, if you just count the number of lines between white's stone and black's stone, the bottom side is one line bigger.  Second, E17 is low, so it makes the top side less interesting for white to develop along (can be pressed down) and for black to develop along (white's stone is low and strong, so black's extension doesn't have much effect on it).  A play on the left is also good, splitting white's side before it becomes a moyo.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[Rev:  This is lax - white has invaded your framework, and is already pincered.  You should aim to attack strongly, and the first goal in that is to prevent white from sliding into the corner to get an easy base.  See the variation.]
;W[qi];B[qj]C[Rev:  Good.  This simple block exposes white's poor play here - he has only strengthened you on both sides.]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[Rev:  Perfect move.  White looks like he will soon be in trouble with two weak groups.]
;W[ql];B[pn]C[Rev:  Again, a simple move that gives you excellent shape and exposes white's weakness.]
;W[pm];B[rn]C[Rev:  This is excellent, ruins white's shape.]
;W[qm];B[rm]TR[on]C[Rev:  Here, however, you give white the chance to do the same to you.  White should play next at the triangle.  This damages your shape, and gets white out into the open.  Instead of this move, you should play at the triangle - this keeps your shape strong, and keeps white under attack.]
;W[rl];B[nl]TR[rj][on]C[Rev:  This move is aimless, given that white has the two marked moves available.]
;W[rj];B[ri]LB[rh:A][fq:B]TR[on]C[Rev:  This is poorly judged.  Setting aside whether it works or not to separate white, at the very least it lets white settle his shape on one side or the other.  Later, you may want to play at A instead, to try to cut off the upper white stone.  With this defect remaining, you can just play at the triangle point here, and leave white to worry about whether he needs another move to protect his group.  The triangle move also takes profit for you, and looks at playing B or the point just above on the bottom to make a framework.]
;W[rh];B[rk];W[si];B[sl];W[qk];B[sk]MA[sm][ro]C[Yes, I have seen damezumari on S5, but I thought that W won't see it.]
;W[ol];B[on];W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[nj]LB[mk:A]TR[oh][ph]C[enigm4: Was this crawling good for B?

Rev:  I have heard this move called "Squeezing out the toothpaste" (you see the image if white plays at A next).  I would play at one of the two triangled points.]
;W[mj];B[mi]C[Rev:  Your group isn't strong enough to play like this, leaving cutting points.]
;W[ni];B[mk];W[lj];B[ml];W[oi];B[om]LB[ph:C][li:B][kj:A]C[Rev:  No need to hurry to play this move.  It's a ko threat at least, or you could get a forcing move at A B or C later.  Who knows which is best.  P7 doesn't help very much right now.]
;W[pi];B[rp];W[nq];B[lq]C[Rev:  Good.  White invaded too deeply, so you have a severe attack.]

;W[oo];B[po];W[mo];B[op];W[kp];B[mq];W[np];B[jp];W[qr];B[oq]
;W[or];B[nr];W[qq];B[pr]C[Rev:  You don't even need to respond here.  White dies either way.]
;W[dj];B[fq]LB[dn:A][eo:B]C[Rev:  First of all, this is a mistake in direction.  Your huge wall is only 3 lines away - white can play at A or even B now and be satisfied that your wall isn't working very hard.  I would enter white's framework with this move.  White can attack this stone, but can't get very much territory, and if he gains a wall, it doesn't matter much in the face of yours.]
;W[hq]TR[cn]C[Rev:  See my comments on the previous move, but it's not too late here.  Change direction and play C6 (triangle), sacrificing F3.  White will gain thickness and a little territory, but you get to enter his framework, and his thickness doesn't work much next to yours.

Should I try to kill white?
Where have I make mistake?];B[go];W[gp];B[fp];W[ho]LB[hn:B]
[fo:A]C[Rev:  You should consider two moves here, A and B.  B is more powerful, but you have to read it out to see who survives.  A is safer, and threatens white's corner stone strongly.]
;B[gn]C[Rev:  This is bad shape, leaving a nasty cutting point.  See my comments on the previous move.]

TR[gc][ld][rd][je]C[Rev:  You are behind at this point, but not by an enormous margin.  If you get to play A first, you can probably even up the game.  Right now it's gote though, and the top side/top right is the biggest area.  I've marked several very big moves.  G17 is big territorially, and also helps defend against the invasion at M17.  K15 and M16 are other ways to defend against that invasion.  S16 tightly defends the corner and takes territory.  Of these, I think G17 is my favorite.]
;B[dl]LB[ek:A][el:B]C[Rev:  This is clearly a bit unreasonable, but there are plays available here.  For example, the shoulder hit at A might be a good point, or starting with the peep at B.]
;W[el];B[dm];W[dk]
(;B[em]C[Rev:  See the variation for a way to capitalize on white's poor play here.]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[bl];B[bp]C[Rev:  Very big indeed, but I think it is too soon to play this.  The top right is bigger.]
;W[br];B[bs];W[ap];B[ar];W[hc];B[jf]LB[ld:B][je:A]C[enigm4: Was it good move?

Rev:  This is the right idea, but it's loose.  A or B are better.  A might leave an invasion behind, but works to reduce white's framework.  B is tighter territorially.]
;W[lh]C[Rev:  Pointless move by white, capturing a worthless stone.  Ignore this and find your own big point.]
;B[mh]C[enigm4: Yes I know, N14 was better to make more secure my moyo on top.

Rev:  Yes, this is not an important stone to save.];W[mg];B[nh]
;W[ng];B[oh];W[og];B[ph];W[pg];B[qh];W[ri];B[lg];W[li];B[kg]
C[Rev:  You don't need to save this stone either.  It's not doing anything.]
;W[me]C[enigm4: How should I response in this position?
M17?

;W[ck];B[ib];W[nb];B[na];W[ia];B[mf]C[Rev:  R15 is a better threat here, threatening to capture the same stones and also securing the corner.  This is my last comment.]
