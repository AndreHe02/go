;B[qp];W[qk];B[qi];W[on];B[pm]LB[np:A]C[Everything is normal up to this point, but this move is misdirected.  This is not a serious attack on W as he can easily dodge away into B's potential territroy at the bottom.  Much better is to play at 'A', protecting the territroy and preparing for a much stronger attack later.]
;W[qm];B[fc]TR[pm][qm]C[The triangled exchange has strengthened W so that an inasion at the bottom is now a much greater possibility.  B must  defend at the bottom.]
;W[np]C[As expected.];B[cf]TR[jp][fq]C[B is playing a fast-paced, risky game.  The bottom is now split and the two marked stones can easiyl come under attack.   B has lost a lot by permitted W to stabilize his group and invaed the bottom.  The position at the top left to not come close to equal compensation.]
;W[ee];B[cc];W[or];B[op]C[I don't know how to deal on this situation.]
;W[oo];B[oq];W[nq];B[pr];W[nr]LB[cd:A]C[This is gote.  B's corner is safe.  W should play 'A']
;B[fo]LB[bb:C][cd:B][dr:A]C[This is big, but W is not going to invade until he has strnegthen the corner with 'A', so it is not urgent. '''B' is bigger.  B might also consider playing 'C' to connect all his stones together and leave W floating at the top left.  In a professional game comentary I once saw the comment that Shuko could not bring himself to play this move becasue it was so low, but in an amateur game it is worth considering.]
;W[dr]C[Bigger, but I prefer a move in to top left.];B[cd];W[nc]
;B[qf]C[This exchange is excellent for B.  It prevents and invasion around this point, backed up by W's strong position at the lower right.  It also nullifies W's influence along the right side]
;W[pb];B[mc]LB[dc:C][kc:B][qc:A]C[Too agressive.  The normal exchange of 'A' for 'B' is adequate here.  Such an exchange would make B's corner strong and the W position is not really a big help to him.  If B were to do this and following it with a movea t 'C' he would have a solid position everywhere and W would find it hard to use the thickness he has built in the lower right.]
;W[mb];B[nb]C[I don't know if the cut is best way. But I can't find another better way.]
;W[lc]C[This seems pointless.  It just gives up the corner.  W should capture the one stone.]

;W[gp];B[fp];W[gq]LB[ip:A]C[This looks a little heavy. W might consider 'A']
;B[gr];W[iq];B[hr];W[ip];B[er]LB[jq:B][ir:A]C["B59, I should put stone on "A", maybe I think I have some predominance and play quick. That's a slip."

SGF:  I do not agree.  A play at 'A' loses the possibiliy of 'B' later, which W can only stop in gote.  Plus the move played threatens the corner. I prefer the move you played.]
;W[ir]

B is probably a little ahead so there is no need to attack to strongly.  Just make sure you do not lose anything and you should be ok.]
