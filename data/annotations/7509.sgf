C[Hello,

I played this game as White on KGS.
I put some comments on 5, 6, 30, 31, 32, 34, 54, 84, 108, 126.

Thank you for reviewing my game...



W: I've prefixed my own comments with W: like here. Conclusions is at the final position.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]C[I usualy dont do well with the chinese opening. I dont realy know how to respond. Invasion around R5 is dificult and generaly end bad, I found K3 a bit passive...





W: I won't comment on joseki patterns, as there are sites and books that handle this better than me. I will just give you something to think about: at your level (and at mine!) no games are lost in the opening. Assuming you make no big mistakes (like dying without compensation), any gain made from a better opening is dwarfed by how the middle game is played.]
;W[ci]C[This time I decided something new, doing myself a chinese opening :-)
I dont know if it is wise. I usualy dont like playing semetricaly as white but I tried it...


W: Dan wisdom will have it that passively mimicing as white is bad - I'm not convinced. On the one hand, yes, blacks first-move advantage gets moved further into the game where it is more vital; but on the other hand, you know your position can't be any worse than the opponents, and if you don't know where to play, just moving somewhere without aim might be worse.]
;B[df];W[fd];B[cd];W[ei]C[

W: This is your first big mistake, I think. C17 is just too big to ignore here. It's not just a matter of who gets the corner, but also of who has a weak group. Letting black play C17 not only gives him a solid group, it makes sure you either have to be prepared to let F16 come under attack, or add another move to defend it anyway, leaving you wanting for time to benefit from E11.]
;B[cc];W[db]C[


W: I think this is the wrong direction. E11 already says that you don't want the corner - D18 says that you want it after all. I would rather look to expanding along the top, or simply keep building the moyo E11 started.]
;B[cb];W[jc]C[

W: Black answers your move, so you have time to expand anyway. Of course, again, E11 is left without a much needed follow-up.]
;B[nc];W[jq];B[cq]C[
W: Black decides he wants all corners, and proclaims he isn't afraid of your centre strength. I think he is wrong, and that this is a mistake. You're behind on territory, but your influence is good.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
;W[cn];B[po]C[

W: Really bold by black. You should close your moyo at this point, and I think there's still an even game.]

(;W[mq]LB[bf:D][qf:B][kj:A][pj:C]C[I was pleased with this position...


W: You're behind now, so I wouldn't be. Black has a _lot_ of almost secure territory, while all you have is a loose moyo - since you took the small point of N3. Consider alternatives A-D]
;B[hl]C[Black seem to me realy deep. I would be realy not comfortable playing that but it ended well to black.


W: Black would play this as he's overconfident. He's already in the lead, and he thinks he's thus the better player, and that he'll come better off with fighting in the centre. Which he did, but that doesn't mean he was right to assume it. K10 seems more balanced.]
;W[jj]C[Trying to cut black...


W: No, you cannot cut in an open playing field. What you are doing is attacking black's stone. When attacking it is important to focus on a goal. The immediate goal might be to kill black, but this rarely works out, so you have to have a secondary goal of how to profit from pushing him to safety. This is a good move for that, as you are pushing black to the lower right, where you are strong. Opportunities would normally arrise to close off more territory on the bottom and/or invade on the right. A more vague goal might be to gain influence in the top centre, to try to close of a new moyo there.]
;B[jl]C[

W: The natural direction to play.];W[qf]C[Probably a mistake. I may have tried a reduction at Q10 for exemple ? Any better ?

W: This is a loss of focus. The main battleground is in the middle; you should keep exchanging moves pressuring K8. M9 springs to the eye the fastest.]
;B[qe];W[qi]C[

W: Big, and common, mistake. If you wanted R11, you should have played it before R15. The only followup to the R14-R15 exchange is to play out at Q14. As it is, you are both handing black excellent shape, and making your R14 stone almost redundant.]
;B[pf];W[qg];B[pg]C[

W: Very bad to let back get outside influence here, and very bad to get a weak group that black can push, thus allowing him to improve K8's circumstances.]
;W[ph];B[oh];W[oi];B[nh];W[pj]C[

W: Same pattern again. Play out (O11), don't let black surround you. You can worry about eyes when you are closed off.]
;B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[nk];B[nl];W[ml]C[

W: Your right edge group is too weak for this.];B[mk];W[lk]
C[

W: A thank-you move. Black is happy to cut you off in sente.]
;B[mj];W[ll]C[I cut black but he get a solid position in the uper right corner. The result is not soo good for white I think...

W: The 123-principle (http://senseis.xmp.net/?OneTwoThree) tells you something here. The M9 stone serves almost no purpose, and is not worth being traded for N10. You should have played M8 directly.]
;B[ni];W[oj]C[

W: Black S12 seems to kill you here. The two cutting stones is little worth compared to the whole of the group.]

(;B[qj]C[

W: Black removes the wrong eye.];W[rh];B[rf];W[rg];B[re];W[rj]
;B[rk];W[sj];B[sk]C[

W: This is a mistake from black. He can do nothing to your group at this point, it is alive, so all T9 does is remove a vital liberty from the Q9 group, which is now in danger.]

(;W[sg]C[

W: Thus this is a mistake as well. It is one point gote. Sente is incredibly important here. Even if your group WAS in danger, If you get the centre, that more than compensates for it.]
;B[ik]C[

W: This is a poor move by black, trying to make an empty diamond for an eye. You can at almost any point play J7 to demolish his shape.]

(;W[ij]LB[ii:B][mn:A]TR[nf]C[

W: There is a proverb "attack from afar, defend up close". This is attacking up close, which only makes your target stronger. Look at the alternatives. The triangle marked point is also worth considering; it is a classical flaw in black's shape.]
;B[hj];W[hi];B[gj];W[gi];B[fj];W[ej]C[

W: This move serves a purpose only if black is already alive, which is not given by far.]
;B[fl]C[

W: Black now has one eye.];W[dl];B[fn];W[kn]C[

W: This move serves a purpose only if black cannot live, which he now has a good chance to do.]
;B[jn];W[km];B[jm];W[ff];B[jf];W[ld]C[Afterward, I dont like M16. But I didnt find anything strong against K14.


W: You have groups to connect to above and below - you can play M14 for instance.]
;B[lf];W[lh];B[mg];W[li];B[md];W[mb];B[nb];W[mc];B[nd];W[ie]
;B[if];W[hf];B[je];W[id];B[kd];W[kc];B[le];W[lc];B[ih];W[hh]
;B[hg];W[gg];B[ig];W[bg]C[A big point to take...


W: B14 is bigger.];B[bf];W[cg];B[cf];W[ho];B[hn];W[go];B[fo]
;W[io]C[

W: This move serves little purpose. K5 would block black from the bottom.]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[jp];W[kp];B[ip];W[iq];B[hp];W[gp];B[gn]C[

W: This should be a big hint to you. Black cannot be killed, even if he ommits this move, so he probably has a secondary purpose in mind. This should get you considering the weakness of the G3 stones.]
;W[nm]C[I have the feeling I give too much to black but dont find beter at the moment...


W: You could always go deeper. Black is weak here because of Q9's lack of liberties, so a move around R4 might work out.]
;B[om];W[nn];B[on];W[or];B[pr];W[op];B[oq]C[

W: This is a mistake by black, your threat was good.]
(;W[nr]C[

W: You should have followed through.];B[np];W[no];B[oo];W[mp]
;B[nq];W[mr]C[

W: This is no more than four points tops, and gote. If endgame gote is yor goal, G2 is bigger. But there are still sente moves left, so no reason to play gote.]
;B[ii];W[fi];B[lj]C[Outch...];W[kj]C[

W: As you noticed, this only compounds the problem. You can connect those stones with L9, but it might be more worth it to play the endgame sente moves first. But even disregarding this, you are 10-15 points behind, even with optimal end-game.]

[ss]C[

W: In general, I would say that you faced a stronger opponent - the KGS ranking of your opponent was probably not very accurate. I think the biggest weakness in your game lies in attack and defense. Not just in the fundamentals of tactic, but also in how to prepare for it, what kind of plans you should make. Going through the links on http://senseis.xmp.net/?AttackAndDefence will probably benefit you.

You also make a few threats that don't serve a secondary purpose. Try to leave weaknesses in the opponents groups alone until you see a way to benefit from them, beyond just exchanging threat for defense.

Other than that, it's just details that come with more experience. You played an influenced-based opening that might be harder to learn to use properly, but which would serve you well against the usually territory-focused kyu players.]

W: If black seeks connection, he will have to do it past K10, which would be difficult.]

W: This safely and soundly cuts black off from any escape upwards, without giving black a number of extra moves to gain shape and eyes.]

(;W[kj]LB[bf:D][qf:B][kj:A][pj:C]C[

W: I think this is the most natural move. Close off a box, while still aiming some influence at the gaps around R13 and R7]
)
(;W[qf]LB[bf:D][qf:B][kj:A][pj:C]C[

W: This aims at the last big gap in blacks left side. You have influence on the other side of the board, so don't have to be afraid of getting a floating group. You play this move later, more on that when it comes up.]
)
(;W[pj]LB[bf:D][qf:B][kj:A][pj:C]C[

W: This is somewhat of a trick move. It's a decent enough move in its own right, but why I would play this is to play on black's tendency to favour solid territory over influence, and build even more influence without giving black too much. If black falls for it, he plays R10; the probably more correct move is Q9, which still leaves you room to pick either influence, or establishing a group on the rights side.]
)
(;W[bf]LB[bf:D][qf:B][kj:A][pj:C]C[

W: This is an alternative to your N3 move. If you really want to make a move that both grabs territory, and threatens to extend the moyo. This move is almost sente, as you can follow up with C15 and cut off D14 for a strong position that expands your moyo naturally.]
