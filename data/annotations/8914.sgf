Hi Adam, I'm Sisyph your reviewer. I will start my comments with some dashes. As always, remember that I'm about 5k on KGS, take my comments for what they are worth ^^

Your main question is what to do after opening is over, so I will try to focus on that topic.

You can contact me if you have any questions.

;B[qp];W[pn]LB[nq:A][oq:B]C[adamz11 [13k\]: At this point should black finish joseki or approach, which is bigger?

--
Well, it's perfectly possible to do tenuki even in the middle of a joseki. As always it depends on the global situation.

Here, I think Black should play the joseki, because the joseki move at A for example, is almost sente. If white do tenuki, you can attack his three stones and gain a lot !

If you do tenuki, you are not sure to get the sente and go back to play A. If White get to play B because of your tennuki, you will be closed into the corner and white will gain a wall facing his bottom left hoshi.

See variations.]

(;B[bc]LB[nq:A][oq:B]C[adamz11 [13k\]: is this move big, or is something like O3 or O4 better?

--
This move is big for sure, but not that big (and he has a weakness !).

But in the opening (fuseki) you should play moves according to an overall strategy before playing big moves. See next comment for details.

In this particular case, B17 is big but it is not really sente (do not really threaten White) and moreover if you do not play it White has no big immedaite threat against your group.

A move at A prevent white to make a moyo while making points. In my opinion it is more urgent and better.]
(;W[oq]C[--
See ? White use sente to attack your corner, considering the upper left corner strong enough.]

Looks like an overplay ^^
Before playing this I hope you read that it leads to something good for you ^^

[qo][op][qp][pq][pr]C[adamz11 [13k\]: At this point, what are the biggest options for black? I have no idea what to do when opening is finished.

--
Well I will give you a rule of thumb when you do not know where to play during the chuban (the fighting part after opening / fuseki) :

1. Defend / Strengthen your weak groups. If no weak groups left,
2. Attack your opponent weak groups. If no weak group left,
3. Play big points.

When there is no weak groups left (all group are alive) you're beginning yose (endgame).

If you look at the goban you can see that you have a weak group and your opponent has one too (triangles). The weak groups can be attacked at the circled points according to one's strategy.

This said, to know where and how to play, the key point is to COUNT and to evaluate the power in terms of INFLUENCE. It will help you to choose a strategy.

See variations.]

(;W[ko]LB[pp:A]C[--
A is urgent ...];B[gn]LB[cq:A]C[--
This move is good because it extends your moyo while reducing white's. Neverthless, invasion at A or a redution around there might be bigger. 

In any case, Q4 first !];W[hc];B[ph]LB[pp:A][cq:B]C[adamz11 [13k\]: Is this a good place to reduce white?

It is a good place to reduce White, but there is better / more urgent moves like A and B.]
;W[gf]
(;B[gd]LB[ge:A][qh:B]C[--
It it right to cut white. Usually A is better to cut. And White has some trick left for you. I tried some variations ...

As White tenukied, cutting at B is really big too ^^]

--
OUCH ! This move should have been played by you for about 50 moves ^^ 
Now White is back in the game.

The situation is complex. As I said :

1. Strengthen your weak groups
2. Attack opponent's weak groups
3. Play big points

The problem with White move is that it gains a lot and is sente as I think White can kill you if you tenuki (See variations).]

[mr]LB[cq:A][eq:B][gq:C]TR[bn][bo]SQ[ip][jp][kp][kq][kr]C[adamz11 [13k\]: is it possible to invade white bottom left and side territory?

--
Well, it was certainly possible before the triangled exchange. Now ... B and C are usual points to try. And you can count on the circle stones. In that kind of situation, you have to count. If you are leading, just reduce around the squares, if not, an invasion  might be better.

In this game, I think a winning stategy is to reduce the bottom in sente, building thickness to be sure to kill the center white stones. And of course avoid white to invade / reduce ^^

That's basically what you have done. But a good human opponent will probably have managed to give you more damage ^^

I' ve tried some invasions to give some examples ...

No more comment after that. Enjoy the game !]

Triangle stones are weak groups to defend / attack.
Square are actual points
Circles are potential points
Triangles show the approximative limit of opposing moyos (influence).
Letter points to intresting points.

You are leading in actual and potential points. You are leading in term of power and potential (influence / moyo) and if you have a weak group, white has one too. So you are leading. In this case you have to play simple moves avoiding complex fights. This leads to sure victory. White will try to complicate the game playing overplay and invasions.

So :

1. strenghten you weak group by playing A. A is really good because it strengthen you AND splits White, invading his moyo. White should then defend his weak group to avoid a move around C.

2. If white do not defend C attack to gain thickness (or kill if possible ^^)

3. play big points. B or a point at the limit of the moyos (around triangles)
