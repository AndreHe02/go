C[Hello. Thank you for the review.

Hi.
Intresting game. First thing i notice for both player is, there's room for improvment in reading as i have shown in exampels.
The second is that it might be time to start studying josekis and the result of josekis, the 4-4 has some intresting and easy ones, but the secret about a joseki is not to get a wall or kill a group. The secret is to know use your surrounding stones. A Black wall facing White group is more or less pointless. Move 41 is unfortunally a good example bad use of surrounding stones.
Other then that I got some links that might be usefull.

Joseki links.

It's almost easier say what they don't have then waht they do have to offer in go.

I must warn you, because my poor reading i play as 3k in KGS but i have big problem beating 6-8k there, they read me to pieces chew me up and spit me out... The Chinese/koreans are truly scary when it comes to reading.]

In this case when W is at R4 and not Q4 i personally think Q17 makes more sense, because 3:rd line aims for territory and 4:th line aim for influence.]

But still wery diffrent, B has  "wall" on 4:th line and W should find it wery hard to live in the corner. D17-18 for B and B has secured some nice 18+ points
Perhaps just D17 instead if C16, B get 18+ points while W 10 points at best.]

And also you have secured the marked (triangels)area with 6 stones as in Instead of Q14 B had played P12 B secured the squares too.]

No moyo and no almost totalt reduction of the influence from the top wall...

Wery strong W move. B at O13 is a good alt if territory is a must.]

If you play crosscut the R9 is gonna help W alot, I would only cross cut if R14 was B but then W wouldn't playN11 but N10 aiming for a wall on the 10:th line or similar.

I do seem to get a little too carried away in the excavation of the crosscut and it's complications....sry]

Just lucky, if you didn't read it out when you played crosscut.]

In generall you should avoid the 4 space extension because of the center point. 
H2 is B weak point and C5 is W weak point. W 3 and 4 line stones actually make W's extention weaker then B.]

But If B played K2, still empty triangle, but it's used to kill and that one of wery few times an empty triangle is usefull.]

If B can convince W that B lives, yes it's a small, wery small, but still a victory.
Depending on how deep W can get into B territory, W can still turn this around. But right now B leads with some 10-15+ points]

B at B on the other hand is a little scary W, because it 1 "kills" P12 and aims for P8 and a chance of reducing and maybe get connection whit K3, so it's can be sente for B depending if W sees it, rather falls for it or not.]
