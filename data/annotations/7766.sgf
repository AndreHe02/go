C[tapir: Dear reviewer, thank you for reviewing this game.

[EV\] This is your reviewer.  This was an interesting game to review -- the lead changed several times.]

;B[jq]C[tapir: Q3 next feels like what Black wishes, but looks like the best move on the other hand.

[EV\] P3 and Q3 and R3 all look possible.  Of course they lead to very different games.]
;W[pq];B[np]
(;W[qo]C[[EV\] This move is probably a mistake.  It is joseki when the corner is open, but with a B stone already at R10, the B game continuation is tough on W.]
;B[qp]C[tapir: I feel I got tricked in the follow up.

[EV\] This is a sharp and good move by B.  It does look like he was hoping for the last W move :)]

;W[ql]C[[EV\] This result is too good for B];B[ro];W[rn];B[sp]
;W[qh]C[tapir: An overplay?

[EV\] Yes, objectively I think this is an overplay, but since W is losing anyway, he needs to seek complications.]
;B[pk];W[oh];B[nm];W[ol];B[nj];W[nk];B[oj];W[mk];B[mj];W[lk]
(;B[rf]C[[EV\] B wants play safely, but this is really too slow.]
;W[lj];B[mh];W[ng];B[li];W[ri];B[rj];W[ne];B[qb];W[jj]C[[EV\] Now W has chances, chasing a weak group, after B played several slow moves.]
;B[jh];W[jf]C[[EV\] This looks like the wrong direction to me.  I would prefer to play H11 to push B toward the top, where W has some strength.]
;B[ji];W[ij];B[hh];W[dh];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf]
;B[cf];W[de];B[bg];W[df];B[af];W[cg];B[bf];W[hf]C[tapir: Is this the correct direction?

[EV\] Given the earlier play at K14, this now consolidates a substantial territory, so yes it looks good.  W could get a stronger attack by playing at G11, but B is not going to die, and he would destroy a lot of W territory above while living.]
;B[gi];W[gk];B[fj];W[el];B[dj];W[ci];B[bh];W[cj]C[[EV\] C8 looks tougher on B, making more territory while attacking.]
;B[dk];W[ei]C[tapir: To defend the cut. I would sacrifice C13 but stay connected.

[EV\] This move loses sente and is not good shape (peeping at a bamboo joint).  B only has a ko above, so I think W should omit this move to play on the other side.]
;B[fk];W[fl];B[ck];W[cb];B[bb];W[cm];B[bk];W[ai]C[tapir: Forcing black to connect while taking territory may be better, but stopping an promising attack is hard. Also I speculated about aji in the corner, but on a second look it doesn't look like White has possibilities to kill there.

[EV\] This would be a good time to break off the attack and make territory on the bottom, with D3 or E3 or F3 or H3 or J4.  The territory count looks good for W now, particularly if B must spend another move here to connect.]
;B[gf];W[ge];B[ff];W[fe]C[tapir: Feels like a mistake.

[EV\] This move is fine.  H15 would also be good, defending with a single move, and threatening G13.]
;B[hg];W[ef]C[[EV\] ??? Defending at J14 is necessary.  W would still have F12 to destroy B eye shape, so B has not accomplished anything here yet.]
;B[if];W[he];B[ie];W[id];B[je];W[jd];B[ke]C[[EV\] Now B is alive and much W territory is gone.  The game looks good for B again.]

;W[nd];B[of];W[mg];B[lg];W[hq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo]
;W[bn]C[tapir: Better C6?

(;W[kq];B[lq];W[kr]
(;B[lr];W[jr];B[jo]C[[EV\] Bad technique, pushing where no cut is possible.  Just hane.]
;W[io];B[jm];W[in];B[kl];W[rg]C[[EV\] Can W really tenuki?  What happens if B plays H8 or H9?  Even if W manages to connect, B gets into the W territory.]
;B[qg];W[pg]C[[EV\] Bad shape for W and helps B make good shape.  W needs another defensive move here anyway (the ko is too big), so it does not let W take sente.]
;B[qf];W[sf]C[tapir: Totally misguided in the next 5 move. No comment necessary.]
;B[se];W[sg];B[rd];W[rk];B[si]C[tapir: I felt like adding a stone here and then having to fight a ko about it]
;W[og];B[rh]C[tapir: White managed to lose some points in sente.]
;W[lf];B[kf];W[le]C[tapir: D18 should have been much bigger.]
;B[kg]C[[];W[kd];B[db]C[[EV\] Enormous, well over 10 points.  Looks like B leads now.  The rest of the endgame was uneventful, so no more comments.]

(;W[jm]C[[EV\] This move looks pretty much forced.  Letting B play here is large and leaves W thin.]

(;B[mh];W[ng];B[nd];W[md];B[me]C[[EV\] Something like this would be tougher on W.]
))
(;W[qr];B[rr];W[pr];B[ro];W[qn]C[[EV\] This is a joseki when K3 and R10 are absent.  There are many continuations from here, which you can look up.  In general, B will get the corner and W will play N3 to live.  But in this game the B stone at R10 will make it hard for W to do anything with the R5 cutting stones, so W is in trouble.]

;B[pm]C[[EV\] W can play this joseki to live on the bottom.  N4 is a sacrificial stone with a fair amount of aji remaining.  This result is satisfactory for W, given the starting position.]

(;B[mp];W[mq];B[lp];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[rn];W[rp]C[[EV\] This also looks acceptable for W.]
