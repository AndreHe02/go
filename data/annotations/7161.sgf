C[Ch1ll1ng: so gl and have fun

This is a game between me and a friend
so i would be pleased if u could report errors of both of us :D

(Im black)

Thanks a lot for reviewing this noob game.

[Rich\]: Hi! I'll put comments and variations as I go, and a summary at the end.]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[ec]C[I would love to see the joseki for this but i can search it myself...

[Rich\]: white 4 isn't joseki.];B[cf]C[[Rich\]: the normal response to an attachment like white 4 would be F16 or maybe F15. Alternatively, you could ignore it and play in another corner... but F16 is too good for white, I think.]
;W[dp];B[bd];W[qo]C[[Rich\]: now a black move at F16 will really put the white stones in trouble.]
;B[rq]C[[Rich\]: If you really want the corner, play at the 3-3 point to start with :) It's much more normal to either extend along the lower side to the left or to pincer on the right side. This is a very small move, with the board so open.]
;W[ql];B[pc];W[qe];B[rd]C[[Rich\]: Same comment again... especially with your stones in the upper left, a move like O16 is fine.]
;W[qi]C[[Rich\]: white's put a lot of stones into a low position.]
;B[qg];W[pf];B[re];W[gc]C[maybe i should try to rescue this position?

[Rich\]: I think so, it's fine to extend at F16 here.];B[cb]
C[but i dont];W[fd];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[mc]C[this one was quite a bit stupid
the corner is safe and there more points on the board  but where to play?

[Rich\]: 1) The bottom left is still vulnerable to an attack at H3. 
2) if your groups are safe, look at how you can attack weak groups. A move at Q12 would split the two stones above and leave them baseless. You probably won't capture them, but you can make influence and territory chasing them.]
;W[jc];B[iq];W[mq];B[oo];W[jr];B[ir];W[jq];B[jp];W[kp];B[nr]
C[[Rich\]: leaving K4 makes it vulnerable and makes it easy for white to escape later. Extend at K5 or the double hane at L5.]
;W[mr];B[nq];W[mp];B[kb];W[jb];B[kc];W[ck];B[ci];W[pg]C[S13 now?

[Rich\]: R12 is good.];B[qh];W[ph];B[qf];W[bj];B[bi];W[rp];B[pe]
;W[rr];B[sq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rs];W[sp];B[sr];W[oe];B[pd]
;W[jo]C[ok here i really didnt now what to do but probably just H/J-4 couse i dont really fear mojis so early

[Rich\]: J4. Capturing K4 would be a very big move for white. Do you mean moyo? It's already late for those...]
;B[io];W[ip];B[hp];W[on];B[pn];W[qn];B[pm];W[np];B[op];W[nn]
;B[qm];W[rm];B[qk]C[too much offence?

[Rich\]: yes, a cut here is possible.]
(;W[pl]C[[Rich\]: see variation];B[po];W[rk];B[pj];W[qj];B[ol]
;W[pk];B[om];W[oj];B[nf];W[of]C[this is grown too much for my taste so i invade it early]
;B[nh];W[nd];B[nc];W[md];B[ld];W[cr];B[eq];W[dq]C[[Rich\]: This is a very small move.]
;B[eo]C[I like too keep forehand but i didnt used it perfectly  i think

[Rich\]: This doesn't aim at anything serious. K16 would be big, having played O12 and O14. D9 is also interesting to expand in the centre.]
;W[jd];B[he];W[hd]C[[Rich\]: White didn't need to connect here at all. A jump into the centre along F or K would threaten to isolate the stone and spoil your moyo.]
;B[eb]C[ok i know that was stupid];W[fb];B[le];W[ka];B[la];W[ja]
;B[ob];W[ai];B[ah];W[aj];B[cj];W[bk];B[dm];W[cm];B[dk]C[ok i dont really shure but probably a fault

[Rich\]: If you're going to block at A12, there's no sense letting him capture it in sente afterwards...]
;W[bh];B[bg];W[ag];B[ch];W[ah];B[af];W[in]C[ok here i have to play H5 or K4

[Rich\]:  Yes :)];B[hn];W[ho];B[go];W[io];B[gp];W[hm];B[ln]
;W[no];B[gm];W[is];B[hr];W[gn];B[fn];W[lm];B[mm];W[mn];B[km]

C[ok there we are here i made some major faults now (im not wery used to KO games but i learned a lot after this game)

[Rich\]: This is an ideal ko - if you win, you catch the group, if you lose you haven't lost anything yourself and get to make two moves against your opponent :)]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[gn]C[here it is

I should play S6 or B5

[Rich\]: B5 is a good one, as you will keep getting several threats in a row.]
;B[sf];W[hn];B[ri];W[rj]
(;B[si]C[[Rich\]: T10 would get an extra point :) See var.]
;W[ej];B[ei]C[so this is the game (the endgame is not very interresting) if u like to review it i would be happy :D

Thanks a lot

[Rich\]: You play some good moves and reading for your strength :)

Don't be too hung up on territory. Moving into the corners in the early game is generally too small, and only makes a few points, while moving along the sides or building up a moyo can make more.

Getting to those "now what?" points in the early midgame:
1) check your groups are safe
2) see if there are opponents groups to attack
3) Look for a big territorial point
4) look to stop your opponent getting a big territorial point.

Attacking groups (attacking them well, at least) is more profitable than just taking territory, because your opponent has to respond. You don't have to kill his group, just chase it around and you'll find your territory and influence growing. Attack and Defence is a very good go-book if you get the chance to read it.

Most of all, keep practising! :)];W[ig];B[ih];W[ns];B[os];W[ms]
