C[***********
Summary:

*White made alot of ill-advised invasions, but black was unable to attack them properly
-I recommend you study the book Attack&Defense, try to find lectures on attack online and work on your reading alot.
-Attack from a distance, do not attach. Use knights moves, caps and shoulder hits to attack. use leaning attacks in a different part of the board to build strength before coming back and attacking the group.

*Opening wasn't too bad, but there was a general lack of severity in play. 
The mini-chinese focuses on a territorial framework. If opponent enters, you must be able to attack him severely or enclose him for huge outside influence.
-Note: Influence must be used for attack.

*Some slow moves were played when huge, important sente moves were available. Be careful not to play endgame moves too early.
-Urgent moves before big moves.

*Quite often you played defensive moves when you were strong, instead of playing severe attack moves.
-Life and death will help you recognize when you are strong and when the opponent is weak.

;B[cn];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj]C[White aims at a large framework game]

(;B[ci];W[rd]C[This is not the best move. White has already played Q10, so he is settled in the area and this is just for points. But this is a 2nd line move in the opening.

Black should ignore this and double approach bottom.]

(;B[jq];W[lc]C[This is a dumb move.]
(;B[ld]C[You're strong in the area. Why are you attaching to a weak stone?

Normally, when white invades like this he is trying to break blacks base and attack him. But in this case, black is strong on both sides.

So preserve territory, do not allow white to get a base, and attack him severely. easy victory.]

(;B[nd]CR[qd][rd][pe][qf]C[This is not a good move. You're forcing white to play where he wants to play. Also, note the possible tiger mouth shape. 

Where should black play?

Note, even if a big fight erupts, fighting spirit usually demands playing q15 to prevent white frm getting that good shape.]

C[Note how white keeps invading and making weak groups.

This is an annoying, but very bad strategy. Reading calmly is important. 

How can you best divide and attack both at the same time?

Ofc, this kind of technique is common in kyu games because it is hard to read far ahead if you're not mid dan.  But learning to deal with this strategy is crucial

There are a few steps when your opponent does this kind of thing.

1.  Ask yourself if you're strong or weak. If weak, strengthen yourself in the best way while putting as much pressure on the opponent as possible.

2.  Ask yourself how you can attack the opponent to get back the lost territory. Usually ill-advised invasions end up causing more dmg to the opponent than you.
Consider leaning attacks, attacking from a distance with knights move. Prevent him from jumping into teh center fast, make him crawl and squirm. Attack shape points. 

3. Ask where he wants to play and play there instead of him.]

(;B[if];W[ge];B[lg];W[kf]C[Again, try not to help your opponent play the move he wants.]

(;B[kk]C[This is a big problem in your playstyle.

Attaching to something usually makes it stronger and is a bad idea when you want to attack.

For attacking moves, you steal the base, then you play knights move, jump, kosumi and cap from a distance. And peep out any shape points.]
;W[jk];B[jj];W[lk];B[kl];W[lj]C[Sometimes when you've messed up, it's better to forget about it and just try to make the best of your current situation instead of going down a faulty path.]

(;B[mj];W[ll];B[mn]C[You've already lost the chance to attack when you played the attachment move. That is why I said to give up the attack and just try to get as many pts in the center as possible. Then you would still have a good game.]
