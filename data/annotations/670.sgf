;B[pd]C[I've asked one specific question, but mostly I'm just hoping to get advice on bigger points, and anything else you feel might be  helpful.  I really don't know why I lost this game (aside from the fact that I played a higher ranked player :)]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qj];W[nq];B[lq];W[pr];B[qq]C[the usual joseki here is p3,p2,o4,n4,m2,l2 and then
the variations, the problem with playing r3 is that m3
becomes weak];W[no];B[on];W[oo];B[po];W[jq];B[nn];W[lp];B[mo]
;W[mp];B[op]C[what was the point of playing p4? YOU only helping white to stablize his group. In any case p3 would be more appropiate here because it treatens o4 and p2.
Because you already surrender the corner to white
is better to play elsewhere, for example f17];W[np];B[oq];W[or]
;B[nj];W[fq];B[cj];W[cf];B[cm];W[co];B[nd];W[qc]C[r17 is a mistake by white that allows you to built strength]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[sc];B[rb];W[rc];B[pb];W[qb]
;B[ob]C[so far very good];W[qe]C[Oops - was there something I could've done to prevent this?

I suppose maybe A was a little overaggressive, maybe I should've just tried to keep white closed into the corner, instead of trying to kill?

s14, r14, r13, ....];B[qf]C[cannot play r14, must be s14];W[pe]
;B[od];W[rf];B[rg];W[se];B[pf];W[oe];B[ne];W[of];B[pg]C[better to lose the three stones and play on the upper left]
;W[og];B[ph];W[ra];B[kc];W[oh];B[oi];W[ec]C[now white has almost the four corners and black has not sealed the center. However, black can still make it.

The white corners are still weak at c3 and c17 and
there is a big moyo on the right that has potential to grow
bigger. The thing is to grow the moyo and at the same time not to lose the group on the left.
Try maybe k6 or o12];B[hc];W[gc];B[hd];W[gd];B[mg]C[the timing of n13 is a little ackward because white has
h15];W[nf];B[mf];W[mh];B[nh];W[he];B[ie]C[at this time is better to enlarge the moyo on the right
m12 or l6 or k14 are some options];W[hf];B[if];W[ci];B[dj]C[need to be aggresive here h13 or d11]
;W[di];B[ej];W[ho];B[fm];W[mn];B[mm];W[ln];B[lm];W[km];B[lh]
C[again the timing is strange l6, m5, k6 , l8, o8  is an option]
;W[kl]C[now the potential of the moyo to grow is gone];B[ll]
;W[kk]C[m8 is bad shape, better o8];B[lk];W[bj];B[bk];W[bi]
;B[ck];W[bn];B[bm];W[en];B[em];W[dn];B[hj];W[hl];B[gk];W[gl]

;B[dl];W[jj];B[ji];W[gi];B[gj];W[ik];B[ij];W[jk];B[cn]C[it was better to play b4 and start a fight for the corner. The game is lost and taking the corneres is your last chance to win. after white b5 there is no hope]
;W[bo];B[fn];W[fo];B[gm];W[hm];B[fj];W[rs];B[rq];W[sg];B[rh]
;W[pa];B[oa];W[qa];B[sh];W[sf];B[ia];W[gb];B[hh]C[In retrospect, I think this was a poor move.]
;W[ha];B[ja];W[ak];B[al];W[aj];B[ng];W[re];B[an];W[ao];B[am]
;W[sr];B[sq];W[qs];B[ss];W[cc];B[sr];W[hk];C[The game is over.  Final score:
   White = 119 territory + 4 captures + 0.5 komi = 123.5
   Black = 82 territory + 2 captures = 84
White wins by 39.5.])
