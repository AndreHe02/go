C[Dear reviewer,

I have written a few of my thoughts into this game record and would be happy if you told me whether you agree with my assessments, and also where I could have played better.

I started this game two months ago on DGS, and it finidhed quite recently.

Looking forward to your review!
Hanspeter

Hello Hanspeter, I will write my comments prefaced with "DB:"


In summary, I think the top three issues are:

1.  Direction of play.  Study finding how to find the biggest areas best extensions.  A great book on this is Otake Hideo's "Opening theory made easy"  (http://senseis.xmp.net/?OpeningTheoryMadeEasy)

2.  When to invade.  You were counting, which is good, but I think counting *earlier* is essential.  Some invasions were too early, leading to trouble for black in the late middle game. I posted a reference to a counting lesson by Steve Fawthrop in the review.

3. Shape.  Strive for good shape moves always.  Some bad shape moves led to avoidable losses. 

DavidB];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[qp];B[op]C[Up to here, everything is normal ...]
;W[pn]C[... and now white makes a move I did not expect ...

DB: 

This is normal too. It is a joseki - one that author Yoshio Ishida (Dictionary of Basic Joseki, 1977, Kiseido publishing, ISBN 4-906574-22-x) describes as the most peaceful response to the 2 space high approach of P4.  

A 'common' or standard joseki follows with black R3, as you played in the game.  I will show the 'standard' joseki that follows from R3 in the next variation.]
;B[qq]C[... so I slide into his corner.

DB:  Good.  this should lead to black settling on the lower side and white taking a position on the upper side.  For me, I think it is a little favourable for black, since now white's two corners will not have an easy time to work together.  White's side position has less of an influence I think.]

(;W[pp]C[DB:  

This move is not in Ishida's dictionary, it is mentioned on Josekipedia (www.josekipedia.com) as a bad move by contributor LiJIan. 

For me it looks bad as well  - black will get a solid corner while white gained a 1 space extension from a 2 stone wall.  Also, white has immediately weakened his 2 stone wall when black obviously follows with Q3.]
;B[pq];W[oo]LB[oq:A]C[DB:
White is helping black build 4th line influence and likely territory.  The cut at A would have been better.]

(;B[oq]LB[np:A]C[
DB: This is solid but I think A is better.];W[no]LB[mp:A]C[I think up to here it is quite good for black.

DB: it is a little better for black, I agree.  But now A is urgent and quite profitable.  Do not let your opponent surround a group if it is avoidable.  Strive to give your groups a future.]

(;B[ce]C[I secure another corner; crawling to n3 did not seem wise.

DB:  N4 is higher and superior.  I do not think that the enclosure is urgent.]

(;W[od]LB[oc:A][md:C][pf:B]C[DB:  

Now is a good time to consider the best joseki for this situation.  Where is the biggest area of development?  There are many responses available to black.  Our job is to find the one best suited for this board. Letters indicate josekis I will follow up on using Ishida's text as a reference.  

But before delving into reference sequences, let's examine the board to find the best direction of play for black.

First, black has no weak groups.  Two solid corners and a single corner stone.  

Second, white has no weak groups. 

Third, the biggest areas must surely be along the top side, black wants to extend from his corner, and the upper right side, where white would like to make maximum use of the wall he built in exchange for giving black such a solid corner. 

Black could play along the right side, to diminish white's potential there, or he could play along the upper side to extend from his corner.  

The possible follow ups I'll cover briefly are:

A - Black's move in the game.  Typically leads to a settled black corner and a white position on the top side.

B - The same joseki as we saw in this game on the lower side.  White will settle on the top side, black will get a stable position that will 'want' an extension on the lower side.

C -  Black plays a pincer on P16.  The pincer puts pressure on the white stone, but also acts as an extension from the enclosed corner in the upper left.  

Which of these choices has the best value for black?  

I had a hard time deciding this.  At first, I thought a pincer was best.  But in the end, I think the best was to settle the corner with A, and then make a more modest extension from the upper right corner.]

(;B[oc]LB[nc:A][pd:B]C[DB: 

white should have blocked at A, if he is choosing to emphasize the top side.

White B makes an interesting joseki that would emphasize the right side, but would give black a substantial corner.]

(;W[nd]LB[nc:A][pd:B]C[DB:

To follow white along the third line (O17) seems wrong to me.  Black is following behind white, gaining 2 points per move, while white is pressing black down, preventing a moyo along the top and white is also gaining influence along the right side. But black has to do something, white could catch P17 with Q17 otherwise.  There seems to be only A or B on the board.]

(;B[nc];W[ld]C[White tries to build strong walls towards the centre.

DB: But the important areas right now are the top side and the right side.]

(;B[dj]C[This is why I next played d10, to weaken that centre.

DB:  This isn't a bad move, but it isn't taking full advantage of your corner enclosure.  the top side is the more natural direction for black to extend.]
;W[dl]C[Strange move. Would it now be possible to play c6? But I leave that for later.

DB:  C6 is very possible, but one shouldn't invade unless there is a need to.  If you can take a strong lead in territory/influence, why start a complicated fight?  Play in the biggest areas first, before entering into a smaller one.

Now an extension from the corner to the top side is even more valuable since it would give black a DOUBLE extension from his corner.]

(;B[jq]C[DB: 
the top extension is more valuable I think.];W[fq]C[DB:  

For me, it isn't time for black to invade yet.  the top extension is more valuable.  But, a good invasion needs to be severe and have multiple directions of 'escape' for the invading stone.  C6/D6 have only 1 direction to run.  Consider B4, a favourite invasion point of mine.]

(;B[dn]C[Here I think I should have played c6 instead; see variation.

DB:  Try a 'probing' move like B4, C4, or B5.  See variation.]
;W[bm]
(;B[fn];W[hp]
(;B[bk];W[co];B[hn];W[ip]
(;B[gk]C[I wonder whether this was necessary. I guess Bh17 now would have been muc stronger.

DB: A black top extension has been urgent for some time now.  :)
But yeah, I don't think this is necessary - black is no longer inside white's influence.]
;W[gc]
(;B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[hf]C[Again, he tries to get centre influence ...]
;B[qf]C[... so I extend to the other side; carefully, because of white's thickness at the bottom left.

DB:

I agree.  now that the top extension is lost to black, this is the biggest area.  The simple 2 space jump from the corner is solid and erases some of the potential of white's thickness.]
;W[pi]C[Very high! Would r11 have been better?

DB:  It would have been better to develop territory, but it would be hard to make a lot here in any case.]
;B[qk]LB[gg:B][lp:A]C[Threatens to connect on the right.

DB: 

Invade only when you need to; that is, when you are behind.  For me, I would say that black is in a good lead.  No need to invade.  Instead, play a big area to build your own.  I really like A, this 'finishes' black's corner and side and adds a good 6-8 points.  I am thinking hard about 'B' as well though.

In any case, this invasion led to a big problem for black on the left side.  (at move 86).  It was avoidable since black didn't need to start an invasion.

SteveFawthrop (DrStraw on KGS) has a nice series of lessons on counting, available here:

(;B[mg];W[nf]C[DB:

Here, white is 90% connected (I can't find a cutting move, but maybe there is a brilliant tesuji somewhere), so black needs to live.  Once black is alive, the game is pretty much over I think.

So for me, I would play shape moves and shore up black's group.]

(;B[og]C[DB:

Did you try to read this?  It looks like a tesuji, but I can't see how to make a good cut from it.]

C[DB:

With this move, I think white catches up considerably.  It will be hard for black to help his weak group without hurting his moyo.  This problem led from firstly, the dubious invasion of D6, and then a second invasion at R9.  This led to black having 2 weak groups on the board.  Handling 1 weak group is fine - but 2 will lead to trouble.]

(;B[jn]C[Probably incorrect. Several variations look better now.

DB:  losing that group would be a huge loss.];W[jp]C[Not a very strong move. White seems very determined to isolate my stones in the middle ... so I'll give him a few.

Why am I being conservative with white's top and right side positions?  Because both need at least 2 moves to finish the shapes.

After studying the position for a while, I think I would choose this move as black.  I think it strikes a balance between preventing white using his lower right wall to good use while not completely losing the moyo potential along the top side.  

White's more reasonable options are A or B.  

A gives white a position along the top side and black the corner.

B settles the position, leading to black having outside influence and white a corner, or a fight.  

I think either of these choices look favourable for black]

(;W[mq]C[DB: intolerable.  While black could fight and cut, white will develop the bottom side which coordinates with his star-point stone at the lower right.  White might also just N4, but I think this is better for white.]

(;B[np]C[Extending is more valuable.];W[nr]C[White can start an invasion, but this is not urgent for white, nor should black be concerned since white will be left with a stone without much potential, or if white chooses to try to keep the stone, a weak group that black will be able to harrass for a strong position on the board.]

(;W[rq];B[pq];W[ro];B[kq]LB[qi:A]C[White is solid and can follow up with an extension as far as A in the standard joseki.  Black has a settled position on the bottom side.  

Other josekis exist of course, but this is a good one to remember.]
