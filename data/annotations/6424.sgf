C[I'm PMurphy and I took white in this game.  I resigned towards the end of the middle-game.  I misread a lot of fights in this game, especially the 1st line invasions.  I was proud of a couple of lifes i eked out, but I gave up too much.  Thanks for your review, I look forward to studying it!

[JB\] I hope I can be of help. I put several comments and variations during the game, and added a summary at the last move.
Best regards,
Jorge];B[pd];W[dp]C[NJM [?\]: Hi, have fun];B[dd]C[pmurphy [9k\]: you too.]
;W[qp];B[cn];W[cp];B[en];W[oq];B[fq];W[fc]C[[JB\] It looks like you are not very concerned with the bottom left; but in that case why did you play 2 stones there?]
;B[df];W[dc];B[cc]
(;W[ec]C[[JB\] This move looks heavy, I would play C18 or D18 instead (see variations)]
;B[pj]C[[JB\] C18 first would be good, though Q10 is also an important point.]
;W[qg];B[nd];W[qd]C[[JB\] Again, contact moves are too agressive. I prefer S16, or P13 and then S16.

First important comment: contact moves are deffensive moves and usually reinforce your opponent, and in this case your stone is weaker: Q16 is closer to O16 than R16 to R13.]
;B[qc];W[qj]C[[JB\] and now R16 is weaker...
Let's continue a bit.];B[qk]C[PMurphy:  I thought I could get away with making life if I had two stones on the third line two spaces apart...apperantly a little more than that is required.

[JB\] Right; it would be ok if they were not in contact with those black stones.]
;W[ci]C[[JB\] So far you have put several stones disgregated on the board, but they are not connected neither they show a clear plan. Notice that (besides P3-R4) all of your stones are weak: they don't even have a base to build eyes.
I can say at this point that you will have to fight a lot to win.

Second important comment :-) You should have a plan and play according to that, otherwise your moves look just random.]
;B[dj];W[cj];B[ck];W[cf];B[ce];W[bf];B[cg];W[bg];B[bk]C[[JB\] This move tries to take white base out, though C13 can be easily killed.]
;W[dg];B[dh];W[ch];B[eg];W[di];B[eh];W[ej];B[dk];W[ei]C[[JB\] Good, it is important to go out, and specilly if you do not have enough space for eyes.]
;B[rk]C[[JB\]];W[qi]C[[JB\] This move connects to R13, but since black moves at T12 and R15 can make things very difficult for white, you should think a way to sacrifice one of the stones to get out with the others.]
;B[qn];W[jq];B[hq]C[[JB\] This is a good move for black: he can choose to attack the corner or play at M3... it will be difficult to defend both sides.]
;W[eq];B[oo]C[[JB\] But now black choose to play in other part. I think he should have played K3 now. Probably he wanted to be sure his stone could escape connecting to P5...]
;W[mp]C[[JB\] ... but he allowed you to make a good move, connecting your stones.]
;B[ic];W[ef];B[cg];W[ee]C[PMurphy:  Here I was planning to catch the E12 group in a ladder, but I overlooked the liberty formed by the Ko

[JB\] it is not bad anyway: you can fight the ko and at the same time help your F17 stones.]
;B[de];W[kc]C[[JB\] Another important comment (#3 :-)
When you attack a stone, if your opponent tries to save it it will come stronger. So never push your opponet against your own weak group: it will make your group weaker.

In this case, just connecting at e.g. G15 may work: black has to choose closing his territory at M17 or defending hist group at the corner, which has no eyes even if he connects.]
;B[je];W[nc]C[[JB\] Again, a contact move will help black to reinforce. If trying to escape you may try L15 or M15, but it will be dangerous for the F17 group anyway.

At this point, black has just a few points of territory, but because of white having many weak groups it will be difficult to keep black of killing one or more groups.]
;B[oc];W[mc];B[la]C[PMurphy:  This move puzzled me, It seemed like it would be easy to run it off the side of the board.

[JB\] I do not think it is a good move.];W[lb];B[ob]C[PMurphy: Until this move.  Now I couldn't let them run east.]

(;W[ma]C[[JB\] You can also play the other side, see variation.]
;B[na];W[nb]C[[JB\] Good one, probably black did not notice this move.]
;B[mb];W[ka];B[le];W[md]C[[JB\] Good again: use a strong group to attack.]
;B[me];W[kd]C[[JB\] This is a "thank you" move. Black is happy to connect. I would have played O15, separating the black stones.]
;B[ke]
(;W[ib]C[[JB\] Since the white group is live, pushing black against F17 again is not good.
Variation 2 shows a way to help F17 while attacking, and variation 3 shows that even if playing in other place black cannot kill.]
;B[hb];W[ia]C[PMurphy:  I was fairly certain I made life here, but I didn't exactly feel all that great about it.

[JB\] Yes, even if it were needed, you are quite enclosed so you cannot use your group to attack or make more territory. The problem is that you played a lot in small spaces, thus having to fight for living and if you get to live, you have just a couple of points.

Notice the difference with the bottom right.];B[hc];W[be];B[bd]
;W[dg];B[cb];W[ed];B[cd];W[fg];B[fh]
(;W[ad];B[ac];W[db];B[bb]C[PMurphy:  Until this move by black, I thought I could kill black in the corner

[JB\] I am not sure black could be killed at the corner, but A16 was not good to start. I have put three variations beginning with D18 instead of A16, in that case black will have to win the ko and escape to live.]
;W[gg];B[gh];W[ge];B[ah]C[PMurphy:  This also caught me off-guard.  Is the white group on the left unconditionally dead after this?

[JB\] This "monkey jump" leaves white with no eyes at the side. The only way to live is to escape, but it looks difficult: you can try to attack the F12 stones, but there is still the ko, and it will be very difficult to connect to the N4 group anyway.
As I said before, by playing your stones so unconnected and abandoning the place after a couple of moves made a lot of weak groups, black would sure kill one or two.]

(;W[ae]C[[JB\] If you wanted an eye here, see variation.];B[ag]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[gm];W[gj]C[PMurphy:  I figured I could run to the center, and black even gave me a chance to form a bamboo joint...but where was I running to?

[JB\] Exactly. You need eyes or connect, and both are difficult.]
;B[ih];W[hg];B[hh];W[pi];B[oj];W[ne];B[od];W[of]
(;B[rd]C[[JB\] I would prefer R15, but anyway white has no eye space.]
;W[qe];B[sh]C[PMurphy:  I had no idea how to respond to this]
;W[rh];B[si];W[re];B[rc]
(;W[mf]C[[JB\] Your answer was ok, but now the standard move would have been T13. Black has to connect and you can make two eyes (see variation).]
;B[jg];W[if];B[jf];W[ie];B[jd];W[jc];B[id];W[gd]C[PMurphy:  At this point, I was reasonably certain this white group was unconditionally alive.

[JB\] Yes.
But, at this point, remember again: you were all the game trying to make your groups live.]
;B[mn];W[io];B[gn];W[jl]C[PMurphy:  Trying to connect those groups, would J8 be better?

[JB\] I think it is not possible to connect if black does not commit a big mistake. He just needs to push your stones against the big black wall.]
;B[hk];W[hj];B[ik];W[jk];B[ij];W[ho];B[go];W[im];B[ko];W[kp]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[jr];W[kr];B[kq];W[ir];B[jp];W[iq];B[ip];W[hp]
;B[jo];W[ln]C[PMurphy: After I played this move I noticed J6, I didn't take that into consideration when I moved H4]
;B[lo];W[jn];B[mo];W[mq];B[lm];W[km]C[[JB\] As you can see, since black is so strong at the center it is very difficult for you to invade. In that case is better to try to reduce, though the game is over now.]
;B[ll];W[kl];B[lj];W[oi];B[ni];W[nh];B[mi];W[mh];B[lh];W[lg]
;B[kh];W[gl];B[hl];W[hm];B[hn]C[PMurphy: And here's where I resigned.  I would have been willing to play out the continuation if I had saved one of those two large groups, but with both gone it was surely a lost cause.

[JB\] Ok. I will try to summarize the things I most noticed:
- do not play contact moves so early in the game (unless they are part of a well known joseki)
- try to imagine a plan and follow it, do not play random moves in so many places
- do not push your opponent against your weak groups
- do not push your opponent if you do not want him to reinforce (unless of course when you are pushing him against you own strong group)
- try to learn a few joseki to use in case you do not know how to begin... of course one should know which joseki to use in each situation, but I have still to learn that :-)
Best regards,
Jorge])
(;W[sg];B[rj];W[se]C[[JB\] Now I do not see a way for black to kill...]

(;W[ai];B[bi];W[ag];B[aj];W[ae]C[[JB\] Black cannot play B12 because of white B10, and if he takes the ko you can connect at B12 (and black has to connect on the side, allowing you to take back the ko or try to escape).]
