C[Dear Reviewer,



Thanks in advance for your time and effort!



My general impression of my own playing style is leaving weak points for opponents to capitalize on. Maybe my shape is to be improved. Not sure if I could have done better in the end game to catch a win. Not giving enough pressure on attacking perhaps?



Thank you.];B[pd];W[qp];B[dp];W[cd];B[ed];W[gc];B[eb];W[df]
;B[fe];W[id]LB[jc:F][kc:C][id:B][df:A][cg:E][ch:D]C[janr: in general it is dangerous to play both A and B high, as the black moves at C and D are difficult te answer.  Usually, I play either white E or F]
;B[cc]LB[kc:B][ch:A]C[janr: so I think it's rather early for white to go into the corver.  I would prefer A or B]
;W[bc];B[cb];W[dd];B[bb]LB[dc:A]C[janr: black should clearly defend (e.g. at A)]
;W[dc]C[janr:white cutting through is very painful for black.]
;B[db];W[ec];B[fc];W[fb];B[fd];W[hb];B[fa];W[gb];B[bd];W[be]
;B[ac];W[eg]LB[eh:A]C[janr: I would prefer A, developing faster, (while still attacking)]
;B[fg];W[fh];B[gg];W[gh]LB[eh:A][ei:B]TR[fb][gb][hb][gc][id]
C[janr: it is important to avoid that the marked group becomes weak.  So if white intends to end in gote on the left (by defending the cut at A), then he should avoid pushing (from behind) here.  Black has a weak group, let him solve his problem himself, and let him spend moves saving his stones.  It is sufficient for white to play B e.g.]
;B[hg];W[hh];B[ig];W[di]LB[kd:A][ef:C][eh:B]C[Not sure if I have done the right thing with his weak group. I don't think I capitalized enough on the attack.

janr: I would expect black now attacks around A.  After all this pushing, white needs to defend the upper side.

Locally, I think B is better.  It avoids that C becomes a forcing move.  C helps black to make shape, se black does not want it to be a forcing move.]
;B[kd];W[je];B[ih]LB[ke:A]C[janr: it may be better for black to first push at A.  The stone on the upper side gets stronger and the move is sente so black gets the turn here anyway.]
;W[ke];B[md];W[ld];B[lc];W[le];B[mc]LB[kc:A]C[janr: A is probably better as it avoids white making eyes by capturing a stone.]
;W[kh];B[ii]LB[ij:A]C[janr: Blacks move is somewhat slow.  I would prefer A]
;W[kc]LB[kh:A][lj:B]C[janr: after white played A he has run out and can make eyes at several places.  Therefore I think capturing one stone is small now.  How about attacking further (and strengthening white further at the same time) at B ?]
;B[hj]C[janr: again a slow move];W[cn];B[dn]LB[fq:A]C[janr: black is strengthening white.  I would prefer to simply answer at A]
;W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp];W[em];B[fn];W[jq];B[fm];W[cl]LB[cm:E]
[bo:C][bp:A][bq:B][cr:D]C[janr: this move is purely defensive.  If white wants to defend, how about doing something active at the same time?  I would first consider A, which may be sente: B, C and D will follow and white would have protected his weakness at E at a large extent by playing sente.  If white plays tenuki, he will lose points in the corner.]
;B[hq];W[np]LB[qi:A]C[janr: I think around A is the biggest point for both sides]
;B[qj];W[re]C[Besides this, what should I do?];B[rd];W[qd];B[qc]
;W[qe];B[rc];W[qh];B[qm];W[nq]LB[oi:A][jo:B]C[janr: this looks like a very strange move.  It is purely defensive and as such it seems reasonably effective.

How about playing at the intersection of the influence of the two weak groups (A) ?  Or locally,  being more ambitious at B ?]
;B[kp]C[janr: now black gives to white what whited wanted to have: the small space on the lower right.]
;W[kq];B[jp];W[lp];B[iq]C[janr: black has now enhanced his moyo and limited white.]
;W[oh]LB[oi:A][kk:B][pl:C]C[I think this is a mistake. Misread the sente down below.

janr: locally, I prefer A.  Globally, maybe reducing with B or first gaining some influence with C can be considered]
;B[lo];W[lq];B[ln]C[Very big... not sure which bad plays lead to this result.

janr: yes, but personally, I don't like the solid extension towards the empty space.]
;W[om];B[ro];W[rp];B[qo];W[po];B[pm]C[janr: again, i don't like to solid extension.]
;W[ol];B[pk];W[pn];B[qn]LB[kb:B][ae:D][ri:C][lk:A][bp:E]C[janr: I dont think this is necessary.  Maybe it's better to continue to center (A) or play good endgame. (B-E)]
;W[ll];B[jm]C[janr: it's painful to draw back like this.];W[pe]
;B[od];W[kb];B[ri];W[rh];B[nj]C[janr: I prefer the endgame moves on the left]
;W[ne]C[janr: Both white groups live and connecting seems unnecessary, and this move does not threaten to kill black.  So I prefer the endgame moves on the left.]

;B[jn];W[mi]LB[na:D][me:A][mi:B][bp:C]TR[lf][mf][nf][lg][mg]
[ng][lh][mh]C[janr: with A and B, white enclosed the 8 marked points.  That's 4 point per gote move.  
The move at C is more than 10 points.  D is more than 7 points sente.]

Locally, A is better as it avoids black playing at A in reverse sente.]
;B[jj]
(;W[mm]C[janr: This is a neutral point.  it is better to play a real point and in this way force black to connect at the neutral point.  e.g. if white plays at A in sente and then at B,  C becomes sente.]
;B[oi];W[pi];B[pj];W[lh]LB[ka:A]C[janr: nobody is playing at A which is sente for black.]
