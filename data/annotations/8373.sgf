AB[pd][dp]C[J:

Hi reviewer,

Thanks in advance for reviewing my game.

My name is Jan and I play mostly moderately slow games on KGS, but I also like to have a few games running on DGS. This is one of them, so there was enough time for finding the right move. (If I could find it.)

This was a rematch from a previous game with no handicap that I also lost.

The opening was quite chaotic. My opponent told me afterwards she thought I almost had her. Nevertheless I lost a center group and from that moment on I needed to make a come back. I managed to kill the top center. And after that even the left upper corner, but -as my opponent afterward also said- at the cost of a large centergroup being cut off. I needed to win a ko to kill the left upper corner but I think I ignored too soon.
On the other hand I lost two central groups and the left lower corner.
It was an exiting game with a lot of killing.

My comments and questions are indicated by "J".
Comment on anything you think is worth commenting.

Hi,

I'm quite irregular on KGS, can play as 2d or 3k so take everything I'll say here with a grain of salt. The good thing for reviewing game is that my strongest point is theory, my weakest is reading so I'll emphasize fuseki and strategic point. My comment will start with the famous sign of the metalheads : \\m/]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[de];B[cg]C[J:

In equal games I like to pincer in this kind of situation with a stone in the corner (D4) behind the pincering stone (C13). So why not do this in a handi-game?

\\m/ : with support on d4 and q16, no reason to dislike that ;)]
(;W[cd]C[\\m/ : should just say thanks and take big territory and base at c17]
(;B[fd]LB[cc:B][dd:C][fd:A]C[J:

Feels not too slow. but denying my opponent a base might be better?
I think the variation C17 also doesn't look too good: White is too solid and can counter pincer C13.
Maybe D16 is a better variation.];W[cc];B[ec]C[J:

Hm. Too slow? White seems to have a base.

Right, better extend along the board (k16 would work well with q16]
;W[cj];B[eg];W[fe]
(;B[gd]LB[gd:A][ge:B]C[J:

Hane better? I think the hane drives white towards the pincered group.

\\m/ : this is ok, hane not bad too, matter of style];W[cn]

I needed to get out and this also attacks the k17-group

\\m/ : The mistake that cost you the game, the group in danger of being seal is e11]
;W[gj]C[J:

But group E11 is threathend to be swallowed.];B[ej];W[ek]
(;B[gk]LB[fk:B][gk:A]C[J:

Hmmmm. Why didn't I do F9?

This looks like a smart move but it isn't.
It's a losing move.

\\m/ : unfortunately you're right. Though I'm sorry but I don't see the smart thing. Related to shape, still have the problem that b is calling for a stone at g11 and w at h11.]
;W[fk];B[fj];W[hj]TR[ei][ej][fj]C[J:

Yuck: Trouble for black.
I need to fight.

;B[gn];W[ho];B[lp]C[J:

This was probably also a mistake.
 Should be at G4.
The stones G7 in the center are more at danger than the L8-group.
Although I also fear L7...];W[go];B[en];W[fo]
(;B[dm]LB[dm:A][do:B]C[J:

This doesn't work.
I worked out 2 better variations.];W[eo]C[J:

As I said: Connecting with D5 doesn't work because the tiger mouth is immediately cuttable because of C6, so I thought I'd do something else..]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[ck];W[cl];B[bk];W[em];B[dn]C[J:

Useless. Can't save these.
Ko-threat spoiled.];W[do];B[bj]C[J:

At least that group is saved...
But I lost the G7 group and the lower left corner is severely in danger.
L8 is still not save...

I think this all came because of move 38 at G9...];W[bf];B[mf]
C[J:

The game felt already lost, but I decided to continue and wait for a chance.
This move connects more or less and attacks L15.
I needed to catch something...];W[cp]C[J:

The corner.... yes....
I decided to tenuki and not follow around. I have a bad feeling about following around, especially in such a game when you are behind.
I decided to try to kill and see if the corner can still be safed later.]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[kc];W[fb];B[eb];W[fc];B[gc];W[qf]C[J:

Yessss! a kill.

\\m/ : w still ahead though ^^]
(;B[qd]C[J:

This may seem a cowards move.
And maybe it is. What if I played behind R14 at lets say R12?

\\m/ : let's try];W[qi];B[lk];W[jk]C[\\m/ : if you assume h8 dead, these 3 stones are no more cutting stones so just 6 points, better to let w take if he wants.]

Nice splitting move.];B[ok];W[pk];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[ir];B[qq]

In the following sequence sometimes people react in the wrong way. I was fooled myself quite a few times with this joseki. I think my opponent did it right.]

Too bad. White plays solidly and I think I can't pul something of anymore. Time to resign.

Thank you for your review.];C[Result: W+Resign

\\m/ : good game anyway. Spend a little time to understand the most usual joseki and, really important, shapes. Also some mistakes in direction that cost you the game.
Look more closely to move 6, 18, 34
