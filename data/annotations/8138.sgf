movement 20
if you can save a group of s4?]

C[Hi Tomasz100, i just skimmed through this game and without looking deep into the moves i can already say that you focus WAY too much on the small pieces of the board and do not see the board as a whole, i will come back to this several times in this review most likely.

There was not much to say for white that i did not already say for black as the game turned into one big mess around move 25.

I would also recommend that you watch theese videos from a fantastic go teacher, it helped me to rise from the 14k stage.

I am sorry this rewiev was kept so short, but i highly doubt that analyzing the game further would help you progress much and it would also be a pain in the ass for me to think through every possible variation on every move you made in the fight on this board. It basicaly becomes a "big pain with little gain" situation.]

(;B[jj]C[Ah you play in tengen, this move will in most cases only work if you have a big moyo. We will see in the next move why this is a bad move in this situation.

This is also not a good way to play if you are unfamiliar to the game

If you are unsure what type of moves you can play in this situation i will make some suggestions in the variations.]
;W[jd]C[Here your opponent plays between your corner stones to avoid you from gaining a moyo and increase your probability of making your tengen stone strong.




White: Good move, it prevents black from playing in the same spot to gain a big moyo and get a powerful tengen stone.]
;B[pp]CR[gc][hc][lc][mc][gd][hd][ld][md]TR[po]SQ[qo]C[2 Mistakes.

1. It is too close, attacking at either triangle or square would be more effective, see previous variations to see why.

2. You ignore whites previous move and give him every opportunity to settle down in the middle of potential moyo to exploit your tengen stone. You can place at either of the circles to preven white from getting a too easy time. It could allso be possible to ignore it like you did here, but when you need moyo i think you should try to get in a fight with white on the top.]
;W[qp]TR[jd]SQ[fc][nc]C[White: I am more in favor of expanding your invasion at K16by attacking at one of the squares although it is notthing wrong with your defence of the corner.]
(;B[qq]C[Here you try to fight for the corner, in most cases, if white wins he will gain a wall facing the middle wich will most likely compromise your tengen stones strength.

I would do something like the other variation.];W[rq];B[qr]

[cf][df][pf][qf][cg][dg][pg][qg][cj][dj][pj][qj]C[From here on out the game just turns into a huge fight over very little territory, i personally do my best to avoid huge fights like theese and try to find the move that gives me the most points, for example in any of the spots marked with triangle wich is far better than fighting that tiny local fight you two did for the rest of the game.]
