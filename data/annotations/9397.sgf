C[Hi,

mein nickname in KGS is schwing, 1k. I will mark my comments with a leading [R\].

As books for your studies I would recommend:
 * 501 Opening Problems by Richard Bozulich (mastering the basics series)
 * In the beginning by  Ishigure Ikuro (elementary go series)
 * The Great Joseki Debates by Honda Kunihisa 

The latter one is old but gold; I doubt that it is still printed, also: no Idea on more recent equivalents. But if you find it, keep it ;). This is not a joseki dictionary but it provides rather helpfull devices on how to choose josekis.

Best,
schwing];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[fe]C[[R\] I don't see this move in actual play very often. Obviously b decided that for him influence is more important, since f15 aims at pressing at d13, after some answer at the corner. Considering the following gameplay, I guess b had in mind the joseki that was played in LR and absolutely didn't want to be pressed down if he would have slided to d18.

Remark however, that a pincer here would lead to a inverse move order of a joseki where you initially played a pincer. This might be an appropriate point when choosing a move in the top-center. The fact, that you didn't chose a pincer at first shows that you aren't interested in top; which might be reasonable. 

Hence, defending the corner seems ok. I think d18 is the better defense. "Your opponents shape point is your shape point".]

(;W[ec]C[Should I play E17?

[R\] e17 technically forces b to immediately f18. Afterwards the corner is still open for an invasion. After b f18 there is no actual further shape move to secure the corner. After b f18 I think you could either split the top with l17 or defend against the press with d11. Therefore, I think, w d18 is better response.]

(;B[eg]C[If variation of Bis possible ?]
(;W[nq];B[pn];W[qf];B[nd]C[Could you tell me How To play?

[R\] defend right side. For a joseki to end equal, where w approaches a b stone ends in either gote or not positionally balanced. Thus, if you continue a joseki in lower right as a sequel, b can continue to attack r14. I would rather defend there.]

(;W[pr];B[mq]LB[mp:A][mr:B]C[I don't know this joseki .

[R\] The idea is obviously to seal w in the corner -- the outcome. If outside is important for w, there is A or B as an answer. Often I chose a, because I don't want b to have it his way. But mostly, espacially in this case (q6 beeing on fourth row), taking the corner might be a good choice. For variations of the joseki, refer to a joseki dictionary (eg., rather basic: http://www.josekipedia.com/, or even better, some literature)]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[mr];B[oq];W[or];B[np];W[nr];B[lq]C[[R\] outcome looks pretty joseki-like.]
;W[qj]MA[qc]C[Should I play R17?

[R\] R10 is fine. Maybe r11 better. I don't think m3 was as big as r10/r11. That is, I think m3 is b mistake. Do you have a response for b r12? After b r12: Be prepared to either play light and saccrifice something (eg., trade for corner) or fight: big time!]

(;B[qe];W[pf];B[ql];W[lc]C[M17 or K17 or G16 is better move ?

[R\] Remark earlier discussion. Also: m17 aims at p17; so might be reasonable.]
;B[jc];W[oc];B[nc]
(;W[od]C[Could you show me this variation ?

[R\] O18 is vital, because after b n18, w p18-connection threatens to connect m17. That's exactly the reason, why m17 is the attack at the corner.]

;W[fq]C[[R\] big -- huge actualy, but I don't think that is the most important move. Cautiously evaluate the position.]
;B[cn];W[dj];B[cg]CR[dj]C[Black C13 block left upper corner .Also ,C10 is isolated

[R\] yeah...];W[bg];B[ch]
(;W[cp];B[en];W[bh];B[ci]
(;W[iq];B[fl]SQ[fb][mg][ok][hl][ko]C[[R\] I'm not going to comment on the occuring fight, because I don't want to read it all out - also: I'm not able to. However, it turns out that the direction of the fight is kind of benefical, because b pushes you further and further into his territorial framework. When doing this he should either be able to kill (unlikely, considering all those weaknesses you are able to exploit) or have a "plan B" to build territory with the occuring outer wall. But the wall that will occur in the center, after w lives, faces towards the bottom and the right site. At both sides there are strong w positions. This "plan B" should'nt result in much territory. That's a concept termed: "attack and defense" or "the direction of play", or concurrently "the direction of attack", which I'm weak at.

However, if b otherwise attacks from the top (with H12 next), you might be able to cut the e6-group and the fight goes one weak vs. another weak group.

That all been said, it might be ok to choose to fight. Nonetheless this is the next point where you should be able to lean back and look at the board from a broad view, wether or not it is ok to saccrifice d10, whether there is something equally big; or even wether you can't decide now what to do with d10 and possibly come back later. Very often it turns out, that b doesn't even want to capture d10, let alone spend moves for it ;). And even if he choses to capture that stone, you got a free move, and there are still plenty of big endgame moves there. Maybe there is something among those squares.]

;W[gj];B[il];W[hm];B[hl]SQ[oj]C[[R\] here I'd stick to the shape move. Again you should evaluate the Position. You might have felt the need to "do something". But in my opinion, you're not that much behind, if even. That top-center group should be able to live. B didn't gain that much territory out of all of his frameworks during the fight, whereas beforehand you spend several moves to enlarge both of you left-side corners. Freaking much, if you ask me. B must get a lot of territory out of the lower right center. It might be enough to just reduce that framework.]

(;W[nj];B[nk]C[[R\] pretty difficult to find an effective reducing move on the left side of this framework. I don't see yet a nice way to exploit the n4-aji. Maybe l5 works, or maybe k6 is enough. If in question, I'd again evaluate -- maybe count some stuff, and see if k6 is enough of a reduction.]

Here, rather soon, b typically would try to force the trade e18 e17 or e18 c17, so that w pincer becomes more difficult.]
