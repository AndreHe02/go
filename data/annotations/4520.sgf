;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[qi]LB[qk:B][qo:A]C[Wr11 seems to be a bit strange ?

KKMD: Here is a common rule of thumb : don't let your opponent make to shimaris, since after that you will fall behind in territory and coming back will be hard. So here there are two natural reactions for black : A to make a second shimari, or first B to attack the lonely white stone,  and probably later A anyway.]
;B[df]C[KKMD: There is no reason to play the high approach.]
;W[fd];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[bc]C[KKMD: After the usual joseki, white gets a lot of territory in the corner.]
;B[cj];W[ic];B[qo];W[qf];B[fq];W[cm];B[dr]LB[cn:A]TR[cm]C[KKMD: This may not be so good in this position. It is joseki when white played the marked stone at A, but with the move of the game, white will make more territory by playing at the san-san. In this kind of position you should aim at the invasion at the san-san yourself.]
;W[cq];B[kp]C[Bl4 is probably too far from the left black stones.

KKMD : Right. White answered well.];W[hq];B[hp];W[ip];B[ho]
;W[gq];B[fp];W[fr];B[er];W[gr];B[eq];W[io];B[fn]C[KKMD: The result seems terrible for black. He has a weak group and its position has been sliced where he was strong before.]
;W[hn];B[gn];W[gp];B[go];W[jq];B[hm];W[lr];B[in]C[KKMD: M2 was a terrible mistake. With this ponnuki you're back in the game.]
;W[cr];B[co]C[KKMD: Very efficient invasion. White would have handled it better, but I see no way for him to avoid a loss.]
;W[do];B[cn];W[dm];B[dn];W[eo];B[en];W[fo]LB[cp:A]C[Finally it is not bad for black, the left side is big.

KKMD: Plus, you have a very big yose at A.];B[qk]LB[gf:A]C[KKMD: A move near A seems more natural to expand your moyo.]
;W[dj];B[ci];W[ck];B[el];W[dl]LB[dk:A]C[KKMD: Very bad answer by white, he loses a move. If he wants to defend his group, A is the move. Anyway, it is probably a bad idea to try to save all these stones ; since black is very strong, white should play more lightly.]
;B[ek];W[dk];B[bl];W[ei];B[ff];W[gi];B[hj]LB[ii:A]C[KKMD: This move has a bad feeling, too close to your thickness. A seems a better direction.]

KKMD: I agree.];W[ko];B[mp]LB[rd:A]C[KKMD: A is clearly bigger.]
;W[jn];B[jm];W[km];B[jl];W[kl];B[jk]C[KKMD: This move and your next two ones are way too small !]
;W[fj];B[fk];W[gj];B[gk];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pb];B[pf]
LB[od:A]C[KKMD: Beware of the cut. I think it does't work right now (see variation), but keep care.]

(;W[rf];B[se];W[sd]C[Is W alive ?

KKMD: Tsumego is clearly my weak point. After a long thought on that position, I think that indeed white can't be killed (see variations). Maybe you should ask a stronger player, just to be sure.]

(;B[sb];W[rb];B[qa];W[pa];B[ra]C[I made a stupid seki in Gote ! Should have attacked the 3 W stones on the left at Q13

KKMD: Locally, yes. Anyway white won't make many points in the center, so O9 seems useless.]
