;B[nq];W[qj]LB[qh:C][qi:B][pm:A]TR[pn]C[The two marked moves are better played at A and B.  This stretches farther up the side and so makes a Black extension from his shimari less attractive.  With the combination played a Black move at C, with the resulting threat to invade, is much more attractive.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci]LB[fc:B][dj:A]TR[nq]C[This is a very steady joseki and is advantageous to Black, who now has solid territory in three places.  By contrast the White stones don't seem to have much going for them.  The upper left is sold but small, the lower right is not optimal as alredy explained, and the lower left star point is now crying.  Star points are played for influence but the two marked black stone completely nullify and influence.  White should probably have pincered at A instead of playing B.]
;W[gq]LB[qf:C][cn:B][fq:A]C[It is hard for White to know which side to play, A or B and so for now I would hold off and place at C before Black gets the chance to extend.  'A' is better than the move played for two reasons: it protects the corner better (if B invades he can live and W's influence wold be useful) and it is more solid, not approaching as close to the strong black lower right.]
;B[ic]LB[bc:B][hc:A][kd:C]C[(i'm not sure about this move
i thought white would play b17 here so I could switch R12 than, to create double wing formation)

This would probably be true if you had played on point to the left of this, but this move is just not a strong enough threat.  Also, it is the wrong direction.  Extend in front of a shimari first, especially if not doing so would allow the opponent a big point.  Also, the sequence bA, wB, bC is gote, but playing A without C is pointless.]

(;W[qg]C[This is weak.  White must extend one point further, threatening the corner.  This is purely a defensive move, with no effect on the corner.  One-dimensional moves should never be played in the opening.]
;B[bc];W[bb]LB[db:A][fe:B]C[This is asking for trouble. If blacks plays at A then W does not have good shape.  Because black is extended to the wrong point at the top White should try to take advantage of that by playing B now, which threatens to invade to top.]
;B[db];W[cb]LB[ab:C][db:B][ec:A][ld:D][ie:E][oe:F]C[(the idea was to play e17, but after calculate that i would have to go on second line i have decided to play j15 in sente(?))

If you are not going to followp with A then don't play B.  Once B has been played black no longer has the move at C in the endgame.  In a position such as this the best play is usually to strengthen your own group.  D (or maybe F) is the way to do this, not E.]

(;B[ie]LB[nd:A]C[This "open tray" formation at the top is not so good.  It is too wide.  White can easily reduce at "A" because he is backed up by a strong grop on the right.]
;W[cd]C[This move has little value.  Black can ignore it and extend down the left side or solidfy to top.  Threat is merely to capture two stone - a yose move.  Not only that, it creates an empty triangle.]
;B[ce]C[Not bad, but not really required this early in the game.  The move implies that black is expecting to attack the white group.]
;W[gb]LB[hb:B][kc:A]C[(i wasn't too happy with the result - white is safe and can easily invade with l17)

This is a nice result for black. White has taken gote to secure a group which was not severly threatened.  White cannot easily invade that A because of black reply at B,]

(;B[cp]C[(is it correct?
after c6 white takes whole corner with c4
or maybe san-san was better?)

Black is low on the left so has no great ambitions to take a lot of territory there.  It is therefore better to invade the corner at 3-3 and let white have his influence.  That influence would not be worth so much.]
;W[cq];B[co];W[bq];B[do];W[ep]
(;B[dl]LB[eo:A]C[Now black is overconcentrated and undercut at the bottom.  Black would be better to push at A.]
;W[nd]TR[ie]C[This is the reason that the marked stone was bad.]

(;B[nc]LB[oe:A]C[This is too timid.  B cannot submit like this. 'A' is much better but probably requires dan-level reading to follow through.]
;W[dj]C[Nice.];B[cj];W[dk];B[ck];W[el]
(;B[dm]C[This is timid.  B is severely overconcentrated.];W[ld]
;B[md];W[me];B[mc];W[le]LB[dm:A]C[Too good for White.  This is because Black gave up sente to play the bad move of A.  In fact 'A' could turn out to be the losing move.]
;B[pf]C[i decide to attack and break to the center...];W[pg]
;B[of]
(;W[ib]C[This is a terrible move.  This area is totally unimportant.  White must seal Black in on the right and try to make a moyo  See the variation.]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[lc];W[kc];B[kd];W[kb];B[ke];W[nh]SQ[ke][le]C[This is too late.  White gained little at the top which was not there for the taking later, but he has lost in the exchange of marked groups]
;B[kf]C[it looks very slowly

No.  This is very solid.  Black can now either easily captuire the White stones to the right or can make good shape in the middle.  This is the key point which prevents White from spoiling B's shape.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[mp]LB[op:A]C[Nice move, but play A first.];B[mq]
;W[kp];B[ki];W[fk];B[lp];W[lo];B[lq];W[ko]
(;B[mg]C[i haven't any idea how to reduce whites moyo so decide to take 4 stones

Taking these 4 stones is gote and has little effect on the W moyo.]
;W[ng]C[Pointless];B[nf]LB[mj:A]C[It is better to move towards the center.  Capturing these stones is only about 10 points in gote.  Playing at 'A" is much bigger.]
;W[fn]C[This is not as big as it looks because B can jump in along the bottom edge.]
;B[jq];W[re]LB[lh:B][mh:A][lj:C]C[Not big enough.  Wa, Bb, Wc is bigger.]
;B[rd]C[Big, but still gote.  You cannot win bv taking gote all the time.  The center is still bigger.]
;W[qe]C[Very small compared to the center.];B[qf]LB[sd:A][pe:B]
C[Meaningless.  This loses the sente hane along the edge and therefore give W a free senete move at A. (Claiming that 'B' prevents the W hane does not hold water because that would be gote.]
;W[rf];B[pe]C[7 pts in gote - very small.];W[mj]LB[lh:B][mh:A]
[lj:C]C[Wa, Bb, Wc is better.];B[no]LB[mp:B][op:A]C[This move shows why W should have played 'A' in sente before playing 'B' earlier.]
;W[mo]
(;B[oo]C[o4 was much better i think]
(;W[op]C[Wrong direction.  See the variation.];B[np];W[pp];B[oq]
;W[rn];B[rq]LB[nm:A]TR[hn][in][ho][io][hp][ip]C[Black might consider giving up the corner to take 'A'.  Protecting the corner is purely defensice, whereas 'A' not only reduces the center but threatens to play in the marked area with a view to attack the 5 stones.  Of course, this last idea is not likely to materialize, but the very threat puts a damper on W's potential around here.]
;W[nm];B[se]LB[kk:A]C[Probably sente, but that is about all.  This can be played at any time and it is even possible that W might ignore it and expand the center at 'A'.]
;W[rg]
(;B[ip]LB[jk:A]C[This is a one-dimensional move.  It's sole purpose is to reduce.  But the territory around here can also be reduced from above at 'A' and this move would also threaten to expand B's center potential.]
;W[kk]C[This proves my comment on the last move.  This is a two-dimensional move, expanding W and reducing B.]
;B[mi];W[ni];B[lj]C[These two moves do not do a whole lot for B.  They just fill his liberties.]
;W[lk];B[hr];W[gr];B[in]LB[ij:A]C[I would prefer a move around 'A', which is a 2-dimensional move instead of this 1-dimensional one.  Both serve to reduce but  'A' also serves to expand B.]

C[This move is not so big - about 9 points in double gote.  I would prefer a move around, or the ko starting with Bb, Wc, Bd.

After this the game is in yose.  It is very close and there are no major blunders after this point.]
