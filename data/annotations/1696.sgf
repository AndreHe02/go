;B[dd];W[pp];B[qe];W[dq];B[qn]LB[pc:C][co:B][do:A]TR[dd][dq]
C[Strange direction, for two reasons.  First, A or B is more natural because of the relative postion of the triangle stones.  Second, a play at C completes the shimari and gives a nice postion at the top. If W were to play a shimari himself after that the situation is symmetrical and favors B becasue he has sente.]
;W[nq]LB[cf:B][np:A]TR[qe][dq]C[Very timid.  W has two 3rd line stones at the bottom, not a good situation after only 3 plays. In the LR a play at A feels better, but better still is a symmetrical play at B. This would be good for B because his approach is backed up by the triangle stone, which would be much better placed that B's triangle stone]
;B[pj];W[fc]LB[kc:C][cf:B][dj:A]C[<I never play against this black's style. I don't know where this move should be.>   This is the wrong side.  An approach on the left is backed up by W's lower left.  This move has the feelign of floating aimlessly.  'A' is another possiblity but I prefer to see it precede by 'B'.  W may also consider a move like 'C' to try to break up the game into small territories. Such a move would be more consistent with W's apparent style of playing for territory instead of moyos.]
;B[hc]LB[jd:A]C[Not very well balanced with the right.  I prefer A]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[de];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[cf]
(;B[eg]LB[df:A]C[B should push at A first, as in the variation.]
;W[cg]LB[od:A]C[<Should I play this move?>   It is definitely big, but in this situation seems too slow.  Giving B sente with a large potential moyo forming is dangerous.  I would consider a move such as 'A', before B gets to reenforce.  Suffering a B play at this point would be worse if W planned to develop the left, but this is not likely in this game.]
;B[do]LB[od:B][cg:A][ei:C]C[Total wrong direction.  B has little prospect of any territory here after B has played 'A'.  Playing 'B' is better and  'C' is an interesting way of playing on a large scale.]

(;W[fq]LB[od:B][fp:A]TR[cg][dq]C[<Should I play at E5 instead?>   Again, too timid.  Tenuki is better as B has little prospects in the lower left because of the stability of the triangle stones.   Playing at 'A' is also much better, but does leave W somewhat dissatisified after the variation shown.  Maybe 'B' is best -- one possible followup is shown]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dp];W[bq];B[cr];W[dr];B[br]C[This is not joseki.  All W needs to do is connect and B is captured.  B should cut.]
;W[co]C[<I think if I play at b4 instead,I'll get a big profit from this corner.>   Correct.]
;B[bp]
(;W[bo]C[Very bad.  See variation.];B[aq];W[cm];B[fo];W[hp]
;B[dh]C[Does not seem urgent.]
(;W[ch]LB[fm:A][gn:B]C[<I think this move help the group in the lower right.So, I think I can play this. But I 'm not sure whether playing around E7 is better.>   This is too slow.  The top left is safe and this just encouraged B to expand his moyo. 'A' is a good attacking point -- there are many variations, but a couple are shown.  W canb also play at B but this could get more problematical.]
;B[fp]C[Nice point];W[gq];B[di]LB[dj:A][dk:B]TR[cm][bo][co]
[cp]C[Too slow. B needs to jump to 'A', or maybe even 'B'.  Because his marked stones are weak, W cannot get into the center from the left.]
;W[cj]LB[em:A][fm:B]C[I prefer 'A'.  Note that 'B' no longer works.]
;B[dj];W[ck]C[W is clearly way behind.  He has played 22 stones and only 2 of them are on the 4th line.  This is the road to defeat]
;B[el];W[pc]LB[od:A][oe:B]C[It is hard to know where to play this move, but it cannot be right to play another 3rd line move.  'A' is the move which most readily comes to mind, but even this may be too deep.   'B' is more interesting.]
;B[nd]LB[nc:A]C[Nothing wrong with this, but 'A" may make it harder on W.]
;W[nc];B[mc];W[oc]LB[od:A]C[two more 3rd line moves!!!  At least play 'A']
;B[ld]LB[oe:A]C['A' is better.  B is too strong to need to play this sort of move]
;W[qd]LB[pe:A]C[Another 3rd line.  There is no way this can be right.  W desperately needs to get out into the center.  'A' is the only move.]
;B[pe];W[re]C[B cannot kill the corner so this move does nothing but strengthen B]
;B[rf];W[rd];B[qg];W[rp]LB[ql:A]TR[me][nj][gm][im][nn]C[<I think I should play at r8 or somewhere in black's territory instead.>   At least this move is not on the 3rd line!.  W MUST get into the center quickly.   All the marked points are worth trying.  'A' is not valid before this move is played]

;W[lo];B[ao];W[an];B[ap];W[es];B[cs]C[White lost this game because he played far too many 3rd line moves.  His game was very unbalanced from this point of view.  By the time he started to play many moves higher that the 3rd line it was too late: B already had a huge moyo.  W needs to learn about the balance of influence and territory and also needs to understand when it is important to play a light erasing move instead of a deep invasion.]
