Reviewer: My comments are marked with "R".];W[fe];B[ge];W[fd]
;B[fc];W[ff];B[fg]C[R: Whoops. It is actually first hand to be considered real mistake.]
;W[gf];B[hf];W[gd]
(;B[hd]C[R: That's why (and where) F3 is a  bad move.
Even if you defend at H5, W gets a free run on your territory with H6. See variation.]
;W[he];B[ed]TR[hg][hc]C[R: There are two weak points at triangle marked places. If White play there, it would cath black stone.]
;W[hg]C[R: Like this.
See variation to look at one of the standard plays in this local position.]

(;B[ee];W[ef];B[df];W[eg];B[dg];W[eh];B[dh];W[hc];B[hb];W[id]
C[R: Now I see that you already now that standard play. ^^']
;B[gb];W[ib];B[ha]C[R: Small gote play. On other side, there are no big points anymore.
Connecting at E7 is safer but doesn't looks necessary.];W[di]
;B[ci];W[ei];B[ia];W[ic];B[ec]C[So far, so good


R: Yes, you confined W on the right side and have a clear lead.]
;W[bi]
(;B[bh]C[This one should be at C2.];W[ch]C[Here it started...

R: Actually, a bit sooner.]
(;B[ai]C[Perfect move, right?

R: Just capture at C1 here. Or connect at B3, since you has more than enough points to play safely.]
;W[ci];B[ah]SQ[ag][bg]C[Bad move. Never-ever-ever make a group with 2 dame at tha edge of the board.

After looking at possible variations there is no way for Black to win now.]
;W[bg]C[Then white started agressive moves

R: This one is only natural. I captures black group surely and destroys territory.]
;B[bf];W[ag]C[R: After this move Black has no hope to win anymore. See variation for the next move to find out why.]

(;B[af]C[R: It's painful, but Black should just fall back here. See comment to move 44.]
;W[de]
(;B[ce]C[R: Like I said, it was already bad. Even if you connect...]
;W[cf]C[And pushed me all way back to upper corner!];B[dd];W[be]
C[R: It is double atari, and you cannot save two stones at A4 and B4.]
;B[bd]C[R: So it's better to just connect at C6];W[ae];B[ad]
;W[cd]
(;B[dc];W[bc]
(;B[bb]C[Again, just capture here.];W[ac];B[ab];W[da]C[What happened? Is this a classic move? Could it be avoided? How?

R: This is not a classic move. White just threw away one of it's stones and gifted you a prisoner.

Let's see what happens if Black decides not to respond here.]

(;B[ea]C[R: This was an unnecessary move.
Unless I read something wrong, but I don't thinks that's the case)]
;W[tt];B[tt]C[R: A general point about this match: try to read a bit deeper and don't create groups that would be killed instantly.
That would have allowed you to win the game with a big advantage.]

(;B[cf];W[ce]TR[de]MA[af][bf][cf][df][cg][dg][dh]C[R: Now the marked white group has 3 dame, and the marked black one only 2 dame.
White wins the capturing race whoever comes first.];B[be];W[bd]
;B[cd];W[ae]))
(;B[be]C[R: Fall back like this, I supposed.
Even if White is stone-thirsty...];W[de];B[cf]C[R: White stone is surely caught.]

W: 28 points
B: 23 points.]))

Black - 28 points.
White - 19 points.
So it's B+9.]))
