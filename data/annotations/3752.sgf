C[I'm looking for any comments that might help my game.  I am Black and around 5k.  Someone commented that my opponent was around 1 Dan so I thought I did farily well considering the rank difference.

Hello Struggle!

This game is one big battle, hard to analyse. My review will cover the parts that are suitable for teaching. Unfortunately a big part of the game is endgame. I skipped this part, because I don't think it helps much to review it.

enjoy,

(;B[cj]C[C10 is a big point on the board, but this way of playing differs from the usual low chinese fuseki strategie. In this situation Black should be happy to secure the corner.

Take a look at the 2 variations I have added, these are the common strategies.

If you would like to take a deeper look behind the concept of the low chinese fuseki, I advice you to grab a copy of "fuseki" (Nihon Ki-in; published by Yutopian) from your local go-stuff-dealer. It has many variation and useful comments.]
;W[oq];B[oo]C[Seems to be playable, but this keima has some weaknesses, that could turn into a problem later on. I would stick with the conservative attachment at P4.]

(;B[qi]C[You missed the crucial shape point. Playing R8 here is top priority! It forms stable shape for you, and denies the same to your opponent. Letting him play on R8 himself is a big loss for you.

See my comment on the variation, and try to feel the difference.]
;W[ql]C[Now he is perfectly stable and you still need a move to fix your shape.]
;B[qf];W[nc];B[rd]C[I think that here I should have played h3 instead of s16.  What do you think?

-- 

S16 seems ok to me. H3 is a big move, but treating L3 lightly is fine.]
;W[iq]
(;B[gq]C[Playing G3 and sacrifice L3 is one option, but I prefer keeping the J3 stone under pressure (see variation).]
;W[hq];B[gp];W[io];B[cp]C[Would h6, e16, e17 be better than c4 here?

-- 

I don't like H6 here, because the corner is still open. E16 and E17 are big moves and I would consider them here.

Your C4 is a steady move, it secures a big junk of territory and helps C10. Not a bad choice!]
;W[ed];B[gc];W[ic];B[ge];W[fc];B[id]C[You make it to easy for your opponent to connect his groups. Connected groups are stable, while disconnected junks are targets for attack. In this situation I would play H17 instead of J16, to keep the groups seperated.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[gb]C[Now he is connected and you end up with some weak stones plastered against his wall.]
;B[hn];W[ej]C[This move shows, why H6 isn't that big. Concordantly I would prefer to play E10 myself instead of H6.]
;B[dl]C[Would d12 be better here instead of d8?];W[fn];B[fl]

(;B[em]C[First you executed an splendid splitting attack, and now you settle for a few points on the left? Here you missed a great opporunity! You can catch the whole group with J9 (see variations).]
;W[hl];B[gj];W[er];B[fr];W[gg];B[ff];W[fg];B[ef];W[dh];B[cf]
;W[cg];B[df]C[This move is slow. Sure, you have to keep the groups seperated, but there is a more efficient move. If you play C15 instead, your groups are connected, the enemy groups are seperated, and you have a big endgame move at B16 as a bonus.]

(;B[jf];W[je];B[ie];W[ji];B[ii];W[gi]C[For some reason I didn't think that white would play g11.  I was also running short on time.  I was not used to the canadian time feature on kgs.

-- 

I'm not sure if this white thing is already alive. Maybe I'm missing a tesuji, but F10 seems to kill (see variation).

You spotted H11 yourself during review, this one also seems to kill.]
