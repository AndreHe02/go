C[I'm playing black.
I added some comments to explain my moves, also some questions. But I don't know, where I made the 'big' mistakes.

Hi Michael.  I'll precede my comments with 'Sirkut>', the name I generally use online.  Thank you for submitting this game for a review.  I hope my comments will be of some help.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pj];B[jp];W[gq];B[md]LB[kc:A]
[kd:B]C[Was this move too close? Should I have played something like A or B instead?

Sirkut> Yes, it was.  I would have chosen 'A' for balance, since you now have 3 high stones and only one lower stone (P3).]
;W[qg];B[cj];W[ch];B[cm];W[co];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[ff]
TR[jc]C[Sirkut> This would have been the time to play K17, giving you a very nice openning.]
;W[qm];B[pn];W[qn];B[qo];W[pm];B[on];W[jd]
(;B[je]TR[ie]C[I was not sure on how to deal with this invasion. Is there a better way?

Sirkut> Try and avoid a direct connection.  It only serves to strengthen your opponent.  Since your wall along the F line is not alive yet, I probably would have pushed from that direction adding to its influence at the same time -- so I like J15 better.]
;W[ke];B[kd];W[ie];B[jc];W[jf];B[id];W[je];B[kc]CR[fc][fd][ff]
TR[ic]C[Sirkut> Since the side in the direction of the corner is fairly strong, you could have played J17 here instead to keep the marked stones safe.]
;W[ge];B[fe];W[hd];B[ic];W[me];B[ne]TR[hc]C[Sirkut> You are not protecting much with the move.  Stopping the cut at H17 is much more important.]
;W[mf];B[nf];W[rd]
(;B[qc]C[Sirkut> I've shown a variation that is a more typical joseki.]
;W[rc];B[nl];W[ol];B[nk];W[jr];B[kr];W[ir];B[jq];W[hq];B[ho]
TR[ei][en]C[Sirkut> Now that your position in the corner group is stable, try pushing from the group on the side instead (see marked point).  Alternate the groups you're working on so one doesn't get forgotten until it's too late.]
;W[fo];B[gn]TR[rb][cc][pf][cq]C[With this move I tried to stop him invading my potential territory and also wanted to connect to the stones on the left

Sirkut> It's too early to try and wall white out of the center; there are many larger and less risky areas of the board to worry about right now.  Walling you opponent out is difficult because you have to protect 4 sides so it does not guarantee you any territory.  Instead get your strength be extending already-strong possitions into your opponent's potential territory or by invading.]
;W[di];B[em];W[dj];B[dk];W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[rb];B[jk]
TR[ig][mg]C[This should prevent white from intruding from the upper side.

Sirkut> This move is too far removed to do much other than show White what territory you are hoping to get.  I've marked two possitions that are better examples of 'capping' moves.]
;W[ji]C[Sirkut> See how your last move invited white to push out instead of holding him back?]
;B[hj];W[hi];B[gj]LB[gi:A]C[Is A better here? Or overplay?

Sirkut> I like your simpler, stronger move better.];W[gi];B[fi]
;W[fh];B[ei]C[I think this was a mistake. I was possibly thinking, that it was possible to cut white]
;W[eh]
(;B[ej]LB[fj:A]TR[ek]C[Should this move have been on A?

Sirkut> Actually it should have been E9.  See variation.];W[ij]
;B[ik];W[ci];B[hc]TR[fc][fd][fe][ff]C[Was that necessary to save the marked stones? Is there a better way?

Sirkut> As you may have noticed from my earlier comment, this move was very necessary, and the simplest and most direct way to do it (as you did here) is the best.]

C[I was trying to find a way to cut from the rest, but it didn't work.]
;W[gh];B[jg];W[ig];B[kg];W[ih];B[hf];W[he]TR[if]C[Sirkut> Oh man!  There was your cut. :(]

[ob][pb][oc][pc][qc][pd]C[I feared an attack on A here, to kill the marked stones. Possibly, I should have played different before.

Sirkut> No worries.  See variation.  Though at move 125 you could have played P16]

Sirkut> White could have tried, but he really wouldn't have anywhere to run to or enough room to make a live group.]
;W[bl];B[lh]LB[kf:A]C[Would A have been better?

Sirkut> As long as you come back and play A so white doesn't get a chance to take it and get a point, then it's an even trade.]

[qs][rs][ss]C[Sirkut> Thanks again for submitting this game.  You played well and with just a few small improvements you would have one by a good margin.
The keeps points to think about that I think will help your game are:
- Try to avoid contacting your opponents stones -- it just makes them stronger
- Don't move into the center too soon -- push against the edges of your opponents territory first
- Once you've decided on a battle to cut or kill, don't give up too soon and don't be afraid to experiment even if you think it might not work.

You will probably get some great new insites if you try and be more aggressive in general -- at least temporarily.
Feel free to email me any questions you may have.  Good luck and have fun!]
