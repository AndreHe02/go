C[Hello,
I've played this game a while back, and even though I know i become stronger now, I still want this game reviewed if possible. My opponent and I are beginners, I only started less than a month ago, and he started a few months back.

The main reason i'm submitting this game, is for beginners like me, to have access to a review directed towards extreme beginners. I hope this will be helpful and beneficial, for myself and others out there.

Thank you http://gtl.xmp.net/ and to the reviewer.

;W[jp];B[jn];W[in];B[kp];W[ko];B[jo];W[io];B[ip]C[Review: Already here, you have possibly got yourself into a fight too early, throughout the rest of the game, the top half of the board is ignored, thats ALOT of points youre missing out on. Dont forget that to win, you need to control the most territory and not have the most captures.]

;W[np]LB[mo:A]C[Starting here i realize he's out to get my three stones, but at that time i didnt really realize it so i thought to diverse my play, very randomly.

Review: Yes, he's trying to capture them, best thing to do is keep connected, with something like A]

;B[fq];W[eq];B[ep];W[gm];B[hn];W[gn]C[Review: Again I can't stress the importance of keeping connected. But this doesnt always mean stones right next to each other. Here for both players, their stones are being cut off from other groups, and theres no real influence over territory yet, which is what the opening game is really about.]

;B[gk]C[Instead of G9 if i had played of F7 would that have been the right move?]

[qj]C[I'm nor sure if this would have been better at G7 or here, if it makes a difference.

Review:  No, it was already solidly connected, you have an eye already at H9, and white cannot play at eitehr G6/7 due to an self-atari situation. This move could have been used again to place influence over the top of the board, or the right. See Triangles.

Anywhere around there would be good for gaining more territory. Don't forget about needing territory to win, its not just one big fight! :)]
;W[dq];B[ir];W[gr]SQ[ir][kr]C[Review: These stones are dead, there is no way it can capture stones or make 2 eyes in this space.]

;B[bl];W[dj];B[am];W[bj];B[bm];W[ak]C[Review: Again here, this fight has left black with no territory and no eyes to speak of. This group will have alot of difficulty in keeping alive. See next move.]
;B[al]TR[ai]C[Review: if white plays at A11, it shows that A9 is a false eye, This group is in serious danger of death. If killed, white will gain all the lower left corner as territory.]
;W[el];B[bo];W[co];B[cj];W[ci];B[bi];W[bh];B[ai]C[Review: Well, black's alive, but with only 2 points from all those stones. The players should not be afraid to jump out from their groups and play larger moves. So far the game has been about very small points. Still the top of the board is empty.]
;W[pn];B[bj]LB[ch:2][ao:1]C[When i look at this move now it seems odd, maybe i should have connected at A9 instead?

Review: No no! playing here or A9 fills your own eyes, and has put the group back at risk of death. The group was perfectly safe, white will need to attack at 1, and defend at 2 in order to ensure the group is dead., If black plays at either, he can still live, but its very close!

if you look at the position before this, there was no way that white could play in either space, because he will be killed straight away, and suicide is not allowed in the game of go, and so, that group can not be killed.]
;W[om];B[ao]C[Review:  Black is alive now, as long as he does not fill another of his own eyes. This has helped to reduce whites potential territory on the left of the board because black has made life right within it!]
;W[oo];B[po];W[mm];B[op];W[no];B[gi];W[gh];B[fi];W[di];B[dh]
;W[qo];B[nr];W[qs]C[Review: playing on the very edge of the board is never really a good thing in most circumstances, espeically here, black can easily kill it and it does nothing to help white.]

;B[qp];W[rp];B[os]TR[qn]C[Here i wanted this group to live, but it seems his stone at Q2 had already removed that chance, right?

Review: Not quite, the stone at R1 could have been killed by following it along the second line, and have a look just above the black group in question, at R6 (marked with triangle) there is a double atari waiting to happen, play here, and you get a white stone and a chance of escaping. Very close though!]

;W[sl];B[lk];W[ol];B[nl];W[pk];B[lp];W[rl];B[jn]C[I wanted to kill these groups here, but i guess there is no way.. i don't see it if there is..

Review: No, usually theres not a way, that can be used however as a Ko Threat when it occurs, forcing the opponent to reply, however as seen in the next move, white ignores this and you could have taken these stones.]
;W[kn]TR[jo]C[Review: If black played at K5, the 3 stones to the left would be killed.]
;B[ll];W[ki];B[lj];W[lm];B[nj];W[ok];B[oj];W[ml];B[qj];W[qk]
C[Review: The black stones being built up along R10 are good at containing white, but actually have no eyes at the moment, and dont serve to gain any territory, now would be a perfect opportunity to expand from these upwards into the top right corner, and place real influence over large portions of the board.]
;B[rk];W[rj];B[br];W[ap];B[cr];W[ds];B[cq];W[fs]C[Okay, Now i see it, at K5 i could have killed his stones there. Maybe if i builld around the top right group i could have connected at O5 then surround at R6, T6 and place a kamikaze (is there a term for it?) at R8 so he can kill it, then i'd just do a .. (forgot the term.. where i place a suicide stone, he kills it so i can kill him back).

After getting to this point i see where some of my mistakes are, however a review with some pointers could greatly help me, and anyone else who wishes to start playing Go!

THANK YOU for your time.

Okay, its good you noticed a few of your mistakes, it shows you're learning which is always a good sign =)

A good thing to do for all players is always assess the situation of each group of stones, are they alive or dead? can they easily make life or not? These are just some questions you should ask yourself. For example, look at the 3 stone group at O6, are they alive? Yes they can be if you connect to the larger group at O8,

What both players forgot during the game, that there is another half to the board! the entire top of the board was left alone and there is so much opportunity for points there! Why let it go? Both players need to bear in mind that it is about territory first, as most of the game was close up fighting over stones and seeing who could kill who first.

I dont quite understand what you mean with the kamikaze idea, i dont think that would work in that situation but the term is a 'Snapback' where the player sacrifices a stone in order to gain 3 or more of their opponents in return. ill put an example at the top right of the board. (See next move)]

C[Review:  here's just one example, black can kill 2 stones there, by playing at Q17, because if white takes at Q18, then the white group is in atari, and black can play straight away back at Q17 where the stone was previously and capture the 3 stones then.

I hope this review has helped you! Sorry if I sounded a bit mean in some of my comments, wasnt intended! Constructive criticism! :) If you have any further questions on the game, please feel free to email me at jaybones@gmail.com.

Thanks alot the opportunity to review your game (was my first time haha) and good luck in the future!
