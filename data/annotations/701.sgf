(;W[de]LB[cf:A][df:B][cj:C]C[I wanted to avoid two black corner enclosers, so I played here.But
I cant be satisfied with the outcome, so is it better to play
for a moyo, maybe at "a"?

** Previously (when games were played without komi) it was
considered too passive for white to allow black two shimaris.
But in a komi game I don't think it is necessarily bad. It will
lead to a more relaxed game, of course.
  The move played is probably the "normal" one, but white
could consider (a), (b) or (c) or something on the right as good
alternatives.];B[cg]LB[cc:A][be:B][dg:C][ef:D]C[** Black must play a pincer, of course, but this seems a
bit close. Personally I would prefer a two- or three-point
pincer. With a close pincer it is rarely favourable to tenuki,
so white should continue with (a), (b), (c) or (d). I would
recommend the joseki starting with (d).]
(;W[dj]C[Is this an overplay? I feared a black extension somewhere there
because it would have been a good extension from the corner encloser,
too.
** I wouldn't call it an overplay. But it is simply smaller than a
move in the corner.];B[ce]C[** This connection is too big! There is nothing white
can do to cut through it.]
(;W[cd]C[Probably better from the other side!?
** This move is ok.];B[dd];W[cf];B[be];W[df];B[bf];W[dg];B[ch]
;W[dh]LB[di:A]C[I considered this as a bad result for white in gote
** Certainly very unfavourable. Black is left with a
big move at (a).]
(;B[qn];W[pj]C[** Good move.];B[nq];W[oo];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq]
;W[np]LB[mp:A][mo:B]C[is this move necessary? I wasnt sure during the game but now
i think its ajikeshi. Whats right?
** A move around here is natural - white is involved in
a pushing fight with the black stones below. But (a) or
(b) are considered the standard moves - try to get
"ahead" of the opponent.];B[mq];W[pm]LB[rp:A][lo:B]C[** In most positions immobilizing the opponent's
stone like this is a good move. Here, however, a black
hane at (a) will make the white stones overconcen-
trated. So white should keep going with (b) instead.]
(;B[nc];W[nd]C[** Good.];B[md];W[ne];B[oc];W[pc];B[kd]LB[mc:A]
[lc:B][ld:C][jc:D]C[** Not the proper move - it leaves bad aji at (a).
White can cut straightaway, for example. Black
should play (b), (c) or (d).]
(;W[me]LB[mc:A][od:B]C[** Thank-you move. After black protects the cut
at (a), white must take gote to protect against (b).];B[ld]
;W[pg]C[** White lost a move here.];B[rq]C[** The hane is better.]
;W[rp];B[dl]LB[hd:A][di:B][cn:C][ci:D]C[** (a) or (b) seem preferable. The left side is not so big
because (c) and (d) are miai.];W[gd]LB[ic:A]C[I thought I had to "destroy" something, I knew that he could
split me into two, but I had no other idea.

** Right idea. But when invading look for the opponents
weak spots - unsettled groups, for example. Although (a)
is deeper than the move played, it would be more likely to
succeed because of the pressure it puts on black's group
on the top right.];B[fd];W[id]C[** Ok.];B[fe];W[hf]LB[if:A]
C[** With two weak groups, it's vital to "keep away"
from the other one to avoid black getting a splitting
attack. So (a) here is preferable.];B[fg];W[ci]C[** Good.];B[bk]
;W[bi];B[bg];W[gi];B[hg]LB[jf:A]C[** Now white should once again stay away from
the group on the left. (a) would be a possibility.];W[gf]C[** Unless the two groups can be connected, or an
attack attack against some cutting stones can be
achieved, it is generally too dangerous to play
through like this.];B[ff];W[gg];B[fh]LB[gh:A]C[** When cornered, the proverb says, give up
something! White should try (a) here.]

[dj][ci][bi]C[This is an very unfavorable fight for white, I know this, so
I dont give u the continuation. I lost the marked group.  But my interest is mainly the fuseki.
Why had I such a bad result??

** White didn't make a lot of mistakes, but unfortunately
the ones that were made were quite costly. Especially moves
8, 36 and, to some extent, 28. Then there were some slack
moves in the fight that followed move 42, and that was enough.
Go can be an unforgiving game sometimes!])
(;W[gh]C[** Suddenly white has quite a bit of thickness.];B[fi]
LB[ei:A]C[** (a) would probably be too small for black.];W[kf]
LB[lb:A]C[** Enclosing the black group at the top is probably
most reasonable. If white was desperate he could
go for the kill with something like (a) instead.];B[pb];W[qb]
;B[oa]LB[fj:A][el:B]C[** White had good prospects in the centre. The problem
is what to do with the group on the left - (a) or (b) ? If
white can get some compensation he might be able to
give up these stones and still stay in the game.]))
