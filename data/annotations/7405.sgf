C[My comments are designated by a K
K: I feel in this game I have had a lot of moments where I had an opportunity but I was not able to do something with it.

I also feel some of my overall play is crude. I was hopeing for tips on the fights I make comments about, and also answering my questions.

Thank you for your help.];B[qd]C[>Thanks for submitting the game. It was an interesting one! Black played solidly for territory and w took thickness. White didn't play actively enough, and black was ahead during the middle game, until he created a weak group on the top and the game became complicated. In the end w killed a large lump on the left after a reading mistake by black.

The main problem with both players was their lack of reading. 15+5x30 is a medium-paced game, so there should have been time to see some of the variations. Both players could work on their fighting, taking care to watch the whole board, and also to realise the importance of playing slow solid moves sometimes.

I hope some of these variations help, but they are not necessarily correct! You can probably beat many of them with careful reading. If you have any questions, just find me on KGS (I am "sixsix") or email me.

Thanks!];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp]
(;B[ep];W[hp]C[K: Since I was worried about a D15 follow up after the common joseki of D7 I wanted to avoid that so I just played in the corner, is that idea a good one?

;W[ob]C[>Correct move.];B[pf]
(;W[of]C[K: I know that white wants to do this to help attack the N17 stone, so I just pull back I don't want white to get extra strength from me. After I make Q13 I felt like I had a hard time deciding later if I should play R6 or make an extension, also I do not know if when white played J17 I made the right choice, I just felt like splitting white was not the best course of action.

>Q13 is good, and you should fight. If you don't fight, you should play P13. This move isn't joseki because it strengthens black's right side.]

;B[gq];W[hq];B[nm]C[K: I thought this move was very good, I felt that white was obviously going for a moyo, but...

K: I would like your comments on this move, it is to build my moyo while breaking down whites, while threatening a move around M4.

>This is good.];W[gr];B[fq];W[pe];B[qe];W[og];B[ph]
(;W[ok];B[lp]C[K: when I attack here I thought I could build some thickness so that later I could attack P9, and most likely capture it. After white's next move I was at a loss for what to play, I guess I didn't read it enough, but usually I do not have time with my time limits to read everything. I just felt with so many stones it was going to go well and I played 4th line because I wanted the thickness.

K: What should I have done around here?

>I've put in a rough count of the board (Hopefully the numbers show on your computer). You should count at moments like this, especially before making weak groups. 

I count black ahead by about 10 points after komi, and has sente, so he can play safely to an easy win. The only danger is w making a moyo in the centre]

(;B[kc]C[K: Since there was nothing for me to develop on the board, I felt like this was a good time for me to pull out this stone.

Was there a bigger place or a better less risky plan for me to take? I do not see many other options, maybe C12 first?
