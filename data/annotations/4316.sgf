C[I would like to know of any changes in moves that are manditory for me to imporve my game.

k-san: hey kilroy. okie, that's what i've done here. enjoy!]

(;B[lc]C[k-san: this is extending too far. please see variation.]
;W[gc];B[qn];W[nq];B[pj];W[cj];B[fq];W[cm]LB[dn:A]C[k-san: ogeima feels flat here. d6 instead.]
;B[jq];W[lq]LB[rp:A]C[k-san: extremely slow move. prefer s4.]
;B[jo]C[k-san: and it only forces b to jump out and get stronger.]
;W[nc];B[le]C[k-san: after the jump, the invasion feels like an overplay.]
;W[qb]C[k-san: wow.];B[od];W[oc];B[nd];W[qc];B[rd];W[rc];B[lb]
C[k-san: i think you handled the invasion beautifully. this seem]
;W[ge];B[ch]LB[gg:A][di:B]C[k-san: here i would consider g13, or something more forceful, like a leaning attack starting with d11.]
;W[pd];B[pe];W[pc];B[oe];W[dr]C[k-san: with the ogeima, d2 should be at d3, b/c this leaves more aji to be exploited later. but with the keima (small knight's move), something like s4 is great.]
;B[fr]LB[fo:A]C[k-san: this is very bad. f 5 is so much better. this is one of those moves that's mandatory that they're gotten rid of.]
;W[qp]LB[rp:A]C[k-san: s4 is much stronger.];B[on];W[qe]
(;B[re]C[is S15 overplay? R14 better, or in the following do i miss a tesuji?

k-san: s15 is a huge overplay, b/c when you do that, you give w a huge number of free moves on the outside, and you have no choice but to settle the group by crawling.. please compare to the variation.]
;W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[rg];W[qh];B[rh];W[qi];B[qj]C[k-san: this is asking for trouble. have to settle the crawling group, but in general, this is really bad for b.]

;W[sd]C[4 step ko would it have been better to just P12 instead of hoplessly trying?

k-san: yeah, there's nothing you can do. this was a huge mistake, very important to not be so attached to just 2 stones.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[sc];W[oh];B[og];W[oi];B[oj]C[k-san: i think o9'll be faster.]
;W[mi];B[mg];W[nj]C[Is there somewhere better to go inseads of letting him hane me twice?

k-san: yeah, n13 feels passive. i'd still prefer n9.];B[nk]

C[should i have been able to get out alive? and if not what was the better move?

k-san: i think r2 was the mistake, w should've played m2 instead.]
;B[kr];W[mn];B[fn]C[k-san: dubious move. thinking about c5 here. this seems slack, especially when b is behind.]

;W[ik];B[ij];W[jj];B[hk];W[il];B[kk]C[should i have been sucsessful in caputring these four stones?

k-san: yepyep. i think its unreasonable to try and pull them out, but rather to use them to get free moves on the outside.]

k-san: its pretty hard to. the group is very strong. b11 would be good for startes.]
