;B[pp]C[Ann, just remember I'm a mere 13k at igs, so don't expect nothing wonderful...]
;W[ec]C[This is a extrange move indeed... the variations for the 5-x moves are very high-level, but...]
;B[eq];W[qe]C[Begginers (like you and  me) should restrict to 4-4, 4-3, 3-4 and 3-3 openings, are easier to deal with...]
;B[cp]C[but this move makes sense. Next time, play C4 before E3... it's easier to deal with an invasion after C4 than after E3. Anyway, this time you've been able to play both, so no issue]
;W[ch]C[Very extrange, but after E17... he's leaving is corners very very open]
;B[pc]C[Not bad, but C10 would be great here, extending from your E3-C4 shimari (corner enclosure)]
;W[nc];B[rc]C[I think you should better try to divide and go to the open (P16).

If you manage to live in the corner, it'll be small, and he'll gain big influence (thickness) on the outside.]
;W[pd];B[oc];W[od];B[re];W[rf];B[qd];W[pf]C[See? You've got some 10 points, and he has a nice thick wall...]
;B[rg]C[Not big enough. You should let it as it is.

How about C10 (best)  or Q10???];W[se];B[sd];W[rd];B[qc];W[re]
;B[qj]C[Ok];W[pi];B[qi];W[qh];B[rh];W[qg];B[pj]C[This is a very good move]
;W[oi];B[oj]
(;W[nj]C[What should I have played to save the group in the upper right hand corner?

Humm... difficult question... now you can have a Ko (see variation), but you're almost alive]

(;B[om]C[I probably should have played O 18 here.

O18 is ok, but O9 is better, trying to enlarge your area (moyo) See var.]
;W[ob]C[If White was a little more experienced he would have taken my black group in the corner.   Are these stones already dead?  What would have been a goodr move?

Corner problems are always very complex. I think you can live by playing like you did until...]
;B[pb]C[ok];W[nb]
(;B[rb]C[At this point White could have killed these stones at any time, but he never did.  I think that this group might have been saved if I had played at S 19 then T 18 if White doesn't respond.

Let's see var. Of course S19 is ok...];W[jj]C[Very nice move.]
;B[jp];W[cc];B[ck]C[Good.];W[dj];B[dk];W[cj];B[kc]C[You both have played quite a few very good moves.]
;W[jc]C[Contact moves are not very good for attacking. J17 would be better]
;B[md]C[Nice peep.];W[nd];B[jb];W[mc];B[lc];W[ld];B[ic];W[jd]
;B[kd];W[me];B[id];W[je];B[gc];W[ge]C[Could White have made a stronger move here?

This seems ok, the battle is a little bit odd...];B[fc];W[fb]
;B[gb];W[lb];B[kb];W[ke];B[eb];W[db];B[fa]C[Ok, now you're alive, you should try to gain the open side to reduce your opponent's territory.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[he];B[ed];W[fe];B[dc];W[dd];B[cb]C[I was hoping for a "Ko" battle, but I had too many weak stones.

You don't need a ko here, just E17 would be very good, you'll have a few cuttings points to aim to...]
;W[ec];B[ee];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[df];B[ef];W[dg];B[be]
;W[cd];B[cg]C[I was just playing to see what would happen, no strategy at this point on my part.  I think White could have made a better response.]
;W[eg];B[bh];W[bi]
(;B[bc];W[da]C[I had expected White to play B 16.  Again White should have killed my group on the left hand side and I shouldn't have gotten away with what I did.  /would I have been able to save this group if I had played B 16?

Ok, let's go back and see a var on this, but I think you should not be alive...]
;B[ea]C[This move is not urgent... you should try to avoid answering every opponent's move and look for bigger things... (E9, E10, R4...)]
;W[bb]C[No need];B[bd];W[ff];B[gk]C[Good!];W[gj];B[nk];W[mj]
;B[mk];W[qq]C[With this only move, he's alive (unless you had more stones nearby).

It's a very common joseki, see the var]
(;B[lj];W[lk];B[ni];W[mi];B[nh];W[li]C[Missed the opportunity to play Q 12.

NO! You can Q12! It'll be a very good move indeed (see var)]

(;B[kj];W[oh]C[Now you've lost the chance];B[kk];W[ll];B[jk]
;W[ki];B[ij];W[ii];B[ji];W[jh];B[jj]C[Not a necessary move, better H10 or R4, or...

Please avoid this automatic answering...];W[mh]C[Not a very good one indeed]
;B[oq]C[Ok, the correct idea];W[pr];B[ro]C[I thought that I'd just let White have the corner.  Was there a way to kill White here instead?

No, there was not, but you could had him tied a little bit more tightly]
;W[rp];B[qp];W[rr];B[or];W[os];B[ns];W[ps];B[mr];W[so];B[sn]
C[This is a rather dangerous move, if your opponent happens to be a little bit tricky... (see var)]

(;W[sp];B[qn];W[hj];B[hk];W[bk];B[bl];W[al];B[am];W[ak]C[Same comment as before...]
;B[cm];W[bq];B[ab];W[ca]
(;B[ag]C[White could have killed the black stones to the left at this point, fortunately he didn't realize it, although I did after I made my move.  A 13 didn't help any.  I should have played A 14 instead.

Neither. Your group is dead as it is (see var and prev. var with A14)]

(;W[ai];B[ah]C[White still could have killed my group.

Yes....];W[cr];B[af]C[Now I finally feel safe.   Ideed you are!]
;W[bg];B[bf];W[ad];B[fj]C[No! Now he could kill you just by playing A17! (see var)]

(;W[gi];B[dh];W[ci];B[ei]C[nice sequence!];W[ej];B[fi];W[ek]
;B[fk];W[dl]
(;B[cl]C[You'd better play as in var and stop him.];W[fl]C[It's a big problem having him free on the open...]
;B[hm];W[bn];B[bm];W[dm];B[cn];W[bp];B[em]C[Seems like if White was more experienced, he could have taken advantage of this situation to make more room in the lower left corner.  I think at this point he didn't have much chance to save his group to the left side of the board.  What do you think?

Yes, you could kill him, but he also could manage to scape somehow... this kind of battles are always a matter of experience, and your C6 group does not have too many liberties, but, yes, I think you had the upper hand, but imagine he answered as in var to next move...]

(;W[el]C[Instead of this...];B[en];W[ac]C[Now you're dead! :-(]
;B[ae];W[ba]C[But he didn't see it...];B[ac];W[gm];B[gn];W[er]
;B[fr];W[dn];B[do]C[miner ran out of time and I won by default.

I think you were well ahead anyway.

As a big suggestion of this game, is:

- look the whole board from time to time and choose the biggest move
- avoid answering all of his moves. Just look around and try to picture yourself playing at some other place, what you lose, what you get...]
