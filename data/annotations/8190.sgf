C[A short game where I lost easily. I have several other longer games but really, most of my errors to be corrected can probably be found in this game already.

Would really appreciate tips on improving my game. =)

/Hi, I play as Flamer on the KGS (less active than i used to be, sadly) and am a 7 kyu.  I will be reviewing your game.  If you have any questions, it is probably better to email me at ashrestha1994@gmail.com than look for me online at KGS.  Feel fre  to ask questions.  I will begin anything i say with a /.]

;B[dj];W[nc]C[Should I have played at c13? Considering that if Black plays there, he would occupy the entire left side.
/The option as i understand it is more stylistic than a right/wrong.  However, i think R14 is the better move because you don't have any territory at all yet, and black has a strong control of the left.  Had you played G3, I think this move makes a little more sense.  Playing here is not devastatingly bad, and probably doesn't matter that much if you play it correctly.  This is harder to play correctly, though.  Sorry if that was a little rambly...]
;B[qf]
(;W[pc]C[/this move is very odd.  Its not a normal joseki, because there is no reason to contact black when he is stronger than you.  He has 2 stones in the area, and one in the corner, placing a slight pressure on your growth at the top.  Meanwhile, you are asking him to fight you.  I would play lightly.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[od];B[pe];W[oe]C[/dont try to lift this wall up.  If you do, you are giving him more territory at the right while you are gaining little because his D16 stone exerts influence on your wall.  If you are going to come top when he has both corner stones, you must play low or approach his left corner quickly.]
;B[qn];W[nq]C[Similarly, would a pincer be a better response?
/I don't like the pincer, because he has the top right corner.  O4 seems smarter here though, because you have a strong left corner and you want to be able to build upward.]
;B[pj];W[fd]C[Honestly, I meant to play this at f17 instead but mis-clicked. Still, I thought this wasn't a bad move. What are the considerations for playing on the third line or fourth line when approaching the opponent's star point stone?

/My understanding is you never play the 4th line, unless there is some very dire reason.  Think ladder breaker.  Granted, that is in professional play, and you can be more lenient in amateur play.  However, as i said before, play low when you are squished like this to ensure you  A. have a base (not such a problem here , because you have one at the top right corner) and B. have territory (this matters a lot in this scenario).  You don't have that much territory.]
;B[df];W[hc];B[jq];W[hq]TR[kp]SQ[pl][ql]C[I have no idea how to approach his move.

is k5 or k2 an appropriate response?

/K2 and K5 don't make any sense.  Your response is okay, but its small.  From it, you gain something like 2 or 3 points.  In this context I would ask the following questions:
1. Does it threaten a group? no
2. Can I kill it? probably not.  He has a lot to latch on to as he goes up.
3. What can i gain from trying to kill it?  Where would I expand because of the fight?  In this case, you would expand upward.  I can see that being useful if you approached from the right side.  Think a move at L4 (triangle).  This would force him upward, and strengthen your right so that a pincer at R or Q 8 (Square) would be more effective/feasible.]

(;B[cd]C[I thought that Black should have played d17 instead.
/that's standard, but black is being smart here.  He knows he can't kill white F16, and he doesn't see you getting much territory top, so that wall is less useful.  White in this scenario gans something like 8-12 points, while in D16 white still gains something close to 6 ponits, and black loses many more.  The difference is marginal, if the wall was going to be more useful I would go with D17 hands down.]
;W[dc];B[bc];W[ed];B[fp];W[ff]C[In retrospect, this move does nothing and I should have played at l16, is that the correct move at this point?
/this move does something.  It gives you height, which now gives you a moyo with your wall on the right.  It is important.  It is just secondary to the invasion.  Play this as a followup, L16 sounds solid.]
;B[kc]C[My mistake that I think caused me the game. How should I deal with this invasion?
/I'm not entirely sure; but this isn't as devastating as you probably think it is.  There is a solid chance you could kill it, I would begin with M16.  What this does is it limits his opportunity to expand to the middle, functionally daring him to make life in your moyo.  From there, you just have to stop him from getting two eyes.]
;W[jd]C[/The reason i like M more than K is because M forces him to the left, where I think you are stronger.  Less black stones in the middle there, meaning you can expand with less worry he will break through.  Also, that group has a larger base.  Force him to your stronger stones.]

For the fight, you don't care if he makes a line in the middle, because you can stop him from connecting with it.  But yes, you do need to watch that group in the middle, and I understand why you made this move.]

;B[kf];W[if];B[jg];W[ig];B[jh];W[ih];B[lj]C[I didn't see this move coming, to be honest. Again, I do not know what to do in such a situation where black plays inside an area that I thought was mine.

/This puts you in a lot of trouble.  To be honest, here you have to suck it up and hope you can make life in that group.  Connecting is the best choice.]
;W[li];B[kj];W[ji];B[ll];W[ik]C[/not sure what you are doing here, but it would be better to connect at J10, much safer.]
;B[kl];W[oi];B[nh];W[mj];B[ii]C[I thought that the game was over, I don't think I could create life for my floating group, especially with the strong influence of the left black stones.


This is a really short game, but I have several other longer games similar to this where I did not know how to respond to my opponent's moves and was easily invaded by him.]

(;W[be]C[a misclick.]))
(;W[gb];B[ib];W[kb]C[/no eyes here.  its much less useful than you think.  In a fight like this, where it decides the game, don't care about his expansion into your territory.  So what if he is in your territory, if he is dead?  Dare him to take your territory, so he focuses on taking it while you focus on killing him.  Don't think this way if you can salvage the game from his life, because then you will read poorly and lose games.]
