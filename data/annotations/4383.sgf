C[Hello, this is my first review.   


I will start my comments with S.  Enjoy!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]
C[s19aw [21k?\]: hello
Keithz [22k\]: hi];W[dd];B[qk];W[jd];B[fq];W[jq];B[mp]C[S: Good move by black.  Threatens white's stone and potential for a large moyo on the right.]

(;W[hr]C[S: This was a bad move.  Now that black ignored the threat on his stone, this is white's chance to attack the lone black stone and gain a lot of profit.  

While this move does attack the black stone, it attacks from the wrong direction.  This moves forces black to run into the center, which forces you to protect the left side, which gives black a good opportunity to attack your stones at the bottom.  When making a move, think about what you are forcing the opponent to do and how that will affect your other stones.  Look at variations.]
;B[fo];W[dn];B[em];W[dm];B[hp];W[iq]C[S: This is slow.  The best option would be to jump into the middle.  Not only does it bring your group out of danger, it seperates the eyeless black group on the left from black's other stones.  Always look for ways to seperate stones.]
;B[hq];W[fr];B[kp]
(;W[kq]C[S: better option would be to connect to the group on the left.

see variation];B[gr];W[gs];B[gq];W[er]C[S: bad exchange for black.  He gains almost nothing, wastes some very good ko threats, and he allows you to connect your groups.]

(;B[ld]
(;W[lc];B[mc];W[lb]C[S: take a look at the board here.  White has pretty much no access to the center from the bottom and right and limited access from the left.  This is the perfect opportunity for black to develop a huge center moyo.

See variation]
(;B[mb];W[le]LB[kd:B][me:A]C[Would a black play at B have been better than the one at A?

S: No, black playing there allows white to cut at n16.  A is fine.

See variations.]

;W[mk];B[ok];W[nj];B[oj];W[nh]LB[mh:B][oh:A]C[Again, would the play at B have been better than playing A. It seems like B would take care of the problem white was causing.

S: Yes, black at B punishes white's overplay.]
(;B[oh];W[mh];B[mi];W[lh];B[mj];W[lj];B[nk];W[ml];B[nm]C[S: Time to stop and look at the board again.  You just finished building a huge wall on the right.  The group on the left can still be cut off.  This is the time to cut off the stones and lead them right into your brand new wall.  

See variation]
(;W[km];B[hn]
(;W[il]C[S: Corners, sides, center.  The left is much bigger than making territory in the center.  See variation.]
;B[gl];W[dk];B[el]C[S: You can ignore the peep here and instead nobi.

(;W[dl];B[dg];W[ci];B[bg];W[bd];B[fd];W[fc];B[gc]
(;W[ed]C[S: E17 would have been best to avoid the cut.  Black gets a lot of forcing moves out of this.]

;B[ef];W[hf]LB[gf:A][if:B]C[Maybe I should have played A and then followed up with B rather than H14?

S: Yes, A is critical.   A denies the black group an eye and threatens to cut.  When you see this shape (the E14, E15, F16, G16 stones)  A is almost always the key point to play for both sides.]
;B[gf];W[hg];B[gg];W[ei];B[hj];W[ij]C[S: The black stones up top only have 1 eye and can still be cut off.  G12 would be perfect here.]

;W[jo];B[aj]C[I did not handle this well at all. Is the alternate sequence the right way to handle this sort of situation?

S: This monkey jump is big.  The correct way to play against a monkey jump changes depending on the situation.  For a complete analysis of ways to handle the monkey jump, this site is good.

C[Well played for both sides.  Black saw the tesuji and the bottom left that even I would have overlooked ^_^.

In conclusion, I just want to stress the point that both sides should always be looking for ways to cut apart the opponent's stones.  Forcing the opponent to run while profiting along the way is the road to victory.

Anyway, it was fun reviewing and I hope you find this helpful.]
