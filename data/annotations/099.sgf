RE[W+R];VW[]B[dp]C[black makes a joseki error one his 5th move.

So - white has an advantage right away.

White played inconsistently at the top but black let him get away with it.

White also played inconsistently at lower left and lost both invading groups.

Black self-destructs in the center fight and loses.

General comment:
You need to build using the stones you have on the board already. Creating
two weak groups is a sure way to lose when you get to the dan ranks.];W
[pd];B[dd];W[qq];B[pp];W[qp];B[po];W[or]C[b is joseki]
(;B[nq]C[a is a good response];W[oq];B[cj]M[po][pp][nq]C[b makes the
triangled stones completely functionless and has a good relationship with
your top right corner.

a is not bad - but you are responding to black's initiative not forcing black
to respond to you.]

b works better - see
follow-up moves]

you need to strengthen the triangled stone]
