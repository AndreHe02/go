C[Hi thanks for reviewing this. I play white here.  I would appreciate comments and alternative moves on the opening and middle game. I was never quite sure if I was behind or ahead during most of the game.
Hi, My name is Dylan Carter I am approx. 4-5k. My comments will be preceeded with DC:.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jj]
(;W[pj]C[I thought with tengen, black getting this point would be too good for him.
DC: Maybe, but blacks strategy seems to be to make a domain for himself where he can easily attack invaders. It may be better to play calmly and create areas with which to launch attacks from i.e. K16, K4. Q10 needs to be at R10 to create a stable base.]
;B[qm]C[DC: Black strikes at the soft underbelly due to Q10 being a line too high.]
;W[qf];B[mc];W[rd];B[dj]C[DC: This is not the best point for black here as N17 usally emphasises the corner and generally means that black generally needs to play R17 to complete the corner. White should play R17 and pincer using D16 to provide the correct direction of attack. Again D10 should be a line lower making it less susceptible to attack]

(;W[nq];B[jp];W[kq];B[jn];W[pr];B[qq];W[cg]C[DC: Attacking the N17 group is the best use of the hoshi stone here I believe.]
;B[cp]
(;W[cq]C[DC: My prefference would be to hane on the outside since I like outward influence over direct profit, and the outward influence may balance with the surrounding Black stones would make for a good centre fight. I think that C3 gives black what he wanted here.]
;B[co];W[bq];B[do];W[ep];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd]
(;W[ce];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[fc];B[be];W[bf];B[bc]C[Black seems to have all the influence so I am reluctant to start a fight and concentrate on expanding my territory.]
;W[kc];B[qc]
(;W[ph]C[I was worried about an R12 invasion.
DC: Serves to merely connect the stones less potential.];B[rj]
C[S10 did not seem like a threat.  If he continues attacking I thought it would just let me build up influence to counter his tengen.
DC: Play S17 before L15 the principle being, using thickness for territory the difference is subtle. It also settles the group! which was a problem.]

(;W[ke];B[rc]C[DC: A Vital Corner Point.];W[re];B[of];W[qk]
;B[rk];W[ql];B[rm];W[pm];B[pn];W[om];B[np]C[DC: Black did strike at the S16 Group underbelly leaving dame for white, nice of him ; ) Hence R10 in the future.]
;W[mq];B[mo]
(;W[hq];B[jq];W[qr];B[rr];W[pq];B[qp]
(;W[kr]C[I was worried about life for the N3 group but maybe this is unecessary.
DC: Looks unnecessary; stike at blacks under belly since he played D10 rather than C10, one line makes a lot of difference in Go.]
;B[mm]
(;W[nk]C[DC: Better played at N11, securing access to the centre and leaving potential attacks on the N17 Group.]
;B[nl];W[nm];B[ml];W[ol]C[DC: Saves one stone, better to play around N12 now.]
;B[mj];W[nj];B[mi]SQ[jj][mj][ml][mm][nl]C[DC: Black has played these stones and it supports many invasions around H14]

(;W[rh]C[DC: If in doubt, jump out. Jumping out also provides more fighting support for the centre.]
;B[he]C[I responded to this invasion very badly.
DC: Black has entered your domain looking for a fight, you must oblige. Or possibly couter attack around D8!.]

(;W[de]C[DC: At least you realise D15 is a bad response this is a progression in your game allready.]
;B[hc];W[hg];B[if];W[kg]C[From here on I am just playing desperately, no need for comments.]

;B[pc];W[ob];B[pb];W[mb];B[lb];W[lc];B[nb]C[DC: Simon, just to recap on the main points of the review.

1. A bit specific but R10 would have left the right side settled in one move, allowing you safe manoeuvrings on that side.
2. Try to predict the direction of play and make your stones work in this direction by effectively attacking your opponent.
3. Try to rectify your weak points by attacking your opponent.

I hope I have been of some use to you with my limited knowledge.]

C[DC: Worry about being split by D15 later.])
(;W[kg]C[DC: A good fight will ensue.];B[hg];W[ji];B[ii];W[ij]
C[DC: MIx it up a little. Cause black to lose some territory around F7 as a result. Keep H17 in reserve to connect.]

(;W[de]C[DC: This is possible to take sente and attack at R17, L17 severely. My 5 dan Friend from China taught me this and I think it is very powerful. to give up the corner so easily but recover elsewhere. It also eliminates the weakness @ D15.]
;B[bf];W[kc]))
(;W[co];B[cq];W[do];B[er];W[gp]C[DC: L17 is urgent for taking this game anywhere for white.]

(;W[qc];B[pq];W[kc]TR[dd]LB[kc:1]C[DC: Uses the Hoshi stone to full effect, putting massive pressure on the N17 Group. Remeber sente is the ability to sustain applied pressure on your opponent by playing solid attacking moves that improve your position and ultimately give you control over the game.]
