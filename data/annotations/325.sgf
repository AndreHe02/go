(;W[ed]C[The played move is to passive. You can't allow black to turn  the entire lower part of the board into black territorie, so you
have to invade.
When invading you should look for the weak points in your
opponets position. In this case there are two.
  1. Black lower rigth corner is open at the bottom.
  2. The two black stones E5 and C3 can be seperated if you
       play at D4.
Therefore an invasion at E3 is good, aiming at using one of  those two weak points.
See the variations for some examples.];B[ce]C[Now black is allowed to protect one of the weak points and take territorie
