(;B[ko]C[This is a rather passive move at this point in the game.
Doing this you leave white free to push down the sides and take more.
The variation is an example of what I would do instead.];W[qk]
;B[pj]C[With her last move, white is putting presure on the corner.
This might give them a good position to begin an attack on the corner.]
(;W[qh]
(;B[qj]C[This is a good move to divide white's group in two,
however, it's rather early to play this kind of move when
there are still big points on the board, with the left side
completely open and the upper center still available for 
easy invasion.];W[pf];B[mi];W[pk];B[ok];W[oj];B[pl];W[ol];B[nk]

later in the game. Again, there are still big points on the board.
However, this is only a general guideline and like all things in Go,
not set in stone.];W[oi];B[nj];W[cn]C[With this approach, white has taken sente and is making 
quite a play for the corner.  At this point, white's board
position is stronger than yours.];B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[bn];B[cp]
;W[ap];B[ao];W[an];B[bq];W[od];B[fn];W[gq]C[White here is trying to probe into your defenses.
Of course, you must defend this invasion, as there is
a bit too much eyespace available to safely ignore it.
I would recommend, after securing your position,
looking for a way to take sente.];B[fq];W[gp];B[ho];W[mp];B[mo]

(;B[pn]C[Keep an eye out for big points. This move is still only worth a point at best.
The variation shows that you don't really need to block there.
It would be better to try to press towards the center or try to
divide white's group.];W[rh];B[sh];W[sg];B[si];W[rg];B[hk];W[hl]

boxing you in a the same time. However, you can still take quite
a bit if you really push on the J12 group.];B[nh];W[if];B[lf]

In the heat of the moment it can sometimes be hard to 
see things like that. That has often bitten me in the past.

You asked about this in particular. There is quite a bit of 
eyespace in the lower right corner here that you might 
want to reinforce. I don't see how the H3 group could live 
though.];W[oh];B[ng];W[og];B[nf];W[lq];B[nq];W[lh];B[md];W[mc]

;W[ji];B[kj];W[fd];B[eh];W[dh];B[gg]C[I don't think I would call this stupid. I'd call it optimistic.
This game is nearing it's end and an attempt to cut into
whites territory if warranted. While you lost here, I'm not 
sure you'd have gotten much out of E12 other than cutting
into white's territory .];W[gh];B[fg];W[ff];B[fh];W[fi];B[hj]
;W[hf];B[ei];W[fj];B[cc]C[To sum up, I think you did very well.
I think the main things for you to work on would
be, as you seem to be aware, playing more aggressively
and work on your opening.

You ask about ranking and I'm not in much of a position
to judge exactly, but I would I would say you are at least 
6 stones stronger than your rank here. To establish a 
more accurate rank, I would suggest playing a few rated
games on a go server, such as IGS or KGS. I'd recommend 
KGS as it won't take as long to get ranked.])

This expands your potential and if white does not respond, 
as in the second variation, you can now move to take the corner.]
