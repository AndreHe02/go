;B[dp];W[od];B[qp];W[de];B[kq];W[pj]LB[pm:a][op:b][cn:c]C[This looks strange.  It is hard t osee a god followup move.  'a' is on obvious possibility but it would we be better to play that first and then play 6 if B responds at 'b'.  If B invades the upper right corner this stone is likley to be misplaced and that alon is a good reason not to play it.  I would prefer to play at 'c' adn see how things develop before commiting to a move on the right hand side.]
;B[cj];W[qd];B[ql]C[This move exposes the weakness of W6.];W[no]
LB[ol:a]C[Another strange move.  What is W aiming at. 'a' looks more natural.  If B responds at 'a' then W will live at the bottom but in the process he will likely lose a lot of the petential in the center.]
;B[np]LB[ol:a][op:b]C[Contact plays are for fighting.  B has no desire to fight here.  W is prematurely trying to reduce B's moyo so a move which helps W make shape seems inappropriate. 'a' and 'b' both appeal to me more.]
;W[op];B[oo];W[oq]C[After B11 ,  these moves seem natural]
(;B[nq];W[nr];B[mr];W[po];B[on];W[pp]
(;B[qo]LB[pn:a]C[This is being too greedy.  As the following moves show, W can capture b13 adn 19 in a ladder so this is not good for B.  Better to play at 'a' (see variation)]
;W[pn];B[qn];W[om]LB[qq:a][rq:b][rr:c][qr:d][qs:e][pq:f][pr:g]
C[W  has got a nice result here.  The two B stones are captured and the 4 white stones on the right are not yet secure.  Moreover, W is threatening the sequence Wa, Bb, Wc, Bd, We, Bf, Wg, Ba.]
;B[cg]C[This is undoubtedly a big point but it does not seem worth taking gote for.]
;W[dc]LB[nn:a][qj:b][qq:c][cf:d][dg:e]C[This does not make sense.  B25 is undercutting the W corner so what is this going to achieve?  Removing the aji of B13,19 by playing at 'a' looks good. 'b' , threatening to play at 'c' also looks good.  If W is oging to paly this move it should probably be preceded by Wd, Be.]
;B[jc]
(;W[hc]LB[fc:a][lc:b]C[This leaves behind Ba.  Such a move would not normally be a threat but with the W corner being open I would not like to paly this way myself.  The variation starting at 'b' looks more interesting.]
;B[mc];W[fq]LB[ef:a]C[Looking over the board it looks as though W initial strategy has gone wrong.  W2 and 4 where high, aim at creating a moyo, but W has let B get the solid positions on the left adn the top. In addition both his ujpper corner and right side are undercut and a move around 'a' for B would threaten to pull out B19.  Of course, B's position is not solid either for W so not necessarily behind.]

(;B[fp]LB[or:a][hq:b]C[B needs to make sure his 4 stones at the bottom do not get too weak.  A W connection at is sente against the corner so these 4 stones could become a target of attack.  I would prefer the variation starting at 'b']
;W[eq]LB[gp:a][fo:b][dq:c][iq:d][or:e]C[I don't understand this. W should be happy to follow the usual sequence of Wa. Bb, W32, Bc, Wd as is weakens the stones to the right.  If, after this, B tries 'e' to save them then the right hand side will get into trouble.]
;B[dq];W[gp];B[ep];W[iq];B[be]LB[go:a][hp:b][ko:c]C[This is the wrong direction. The lower side is extremely unsettled and whoever gets to play there first will be at a big advantage.  Ba, Wb, Bc looks better.]
;W[or]C[Excellent move.  W has been threatening this for some time and B needed to be aware if ot. It threates both groups of 4 stones at the same time.]
;B[go];W[hp];B[fg]LB[ef:a]C[B continues to ignore the lower right and will prabably lose some stones if W continues down there.  As stated earlier, Ba is a more severe ladder break than B41]
;W[ho];B[ko]LB[gn:a]C[Allowing Wa is too big.];W[mo];B[lp];W[gn]
;B[fc]LB[ef:a]C[This would have been much more pwoerful if B41  had been played at 'a']
;W[fd]LB[gd:a]C[It seems that this makes it too easy for B. 'a' looks more severe.]
;B[ed]LB[gc:a]C[Conecting to the right with 'a' would make all the B stones stable and leave W wilthout eyes.  Of course, W can get eyes in the corner but it would be gote.]
;W[ec];B[gd]LB[fb:a][fe:b][dd:c][gb:d][gc:e]C[Wa, Bb, Wc looks more solid.  If Bd, W answers with e]
;W[gc];B[fe];W[fb];B[dd];W[hd];B[he];W[fd]LB[cd:a][ge:b][ie:c]
C[Better to leave this unplayed and just play directly at 'a'.  Forcing B to paly at 'b' lessens the impact of a W move at 'c']
;B[ge];W[cd];B[ee];W[ce]C[After this is can be seen that the B58, W59 exchange only helped to solidify B]
;B[km];W[fo]LB[em:a][hm:b]C[This  caputre is not urgent. 'a' is key for both sides and W can play there directly.  If B connects the one stone he does so in bad shape and W can defend at 'b'.  This W64 give  B the cahcne to play at 'a' himself if he chooses.]
;B[dn]LB[dm:a][em:b]C[B is strong here so this seems a bit mild. 'a', or maybe even 'b' are better.]
;W[cl]C[This is unrealistic.  W cannot expect to get anything in the middle of B's thickness.]

(;B[cm]LB[dk:a]C['a' a looks stronger.  There are many possible variations and there may be one which works for W as I didn't have time to look as everything.  However, the variation starting at 'a' looks typical and achieves nothing for W.]
;W[dl];B[rj]C[Undoubtedly a big move but keeping up the pressure on the two invasion stones looks more promising.  B should get sente to play this later.]
;W[ri];B[qi];W[rk];B[rh];W[rm]LB[qk:a][rl:b][sk:c][si:d]C[W has to connect at 'a' so it is better to do it now.  This move doesn't contribute to the attack on B as B cannot prevent it anyway (Bb would be answered by Wc threatening Wd)]
;B[qm];W[qk];B[qr];W[rq];B[qq];W[rl];B[rr];W[jd]LB[qg:a][pc:b]
C['a' looks better.  It strengthens the top right in case B plays 'b', but more importantly is immediately attackes the 3 black stones.  As a result of this attack W shoould be able to connect the 2 groups (including W6 and W24) together and to get an attack on B27,29.  Moving directly against them seems to direct.]
;B[kd];W[ie];B[ol]C[An attack againts this group is not likely to succeed when B has weak stones on the board.]
;W[nl];B[pl];W[dg]LB[nk:a][ml:b][oi:c][qg:d][nm:e][dh:f][mm:g]
C[B is threatening Ba, Wb, Bc on the right so W should play there to protect against it.  B is also threatening 'd'. W needs to patect against these moves by playing 'g'.  This W88 cannot be expected to achieve much.  If B answers at 'f'  W's two stones below may come under attack.]
;B[cf]LB[dh:a][em:b]C[Ba, threatening a play at 'b' looks more proming. B does not need to worry about B37.  If W captures it in gote B is satisfied as there biger points on the board.]
;W[df];B[dh];W[ch];B[bh]LB[di:a];W[eh];B[di];W[ig];B[gh];W[eg]
;B[hi];W[nb]C[Wrong direction.  The right side is much bigger.]
;B[nc];W[oc];B[mb];W[ob]C[These moves do not secure 2 eyes for B and so are best left unplayed.  All they do is strengthen W.]

;B[ls];W[in];B[jo];W[lr];B[qj];W[ls]LB[nk:a]C[B has let himself be outplayed in this whole sequence. B105 at 'a', as explained earlier would have ensured victory.  Because of the thickness gained in the center B still has a chacne to win, but losing a big group like this makes it harder.]
;B[pk];W[ke];B[ld]LB[jb:a][nk:b][ij:c]C[W is ahead in secure territory by at least 15 points so if he can stop B from making a lot from the center thickness he has a good chance.  However, it is not clear how to set about doing this.  W's best chance looks like threatening to kill something but where to start? Wa reduces the top group to one eye but there should be no problem running out. Wb isolates the 5 B stones including B63 but there dones't seem to be much of the threat there.  Perhaps the best chance is to play 'c' in the hope of either cutting of the group including B99 or making something of Wb.  In this way, maybe B will be prevented from sevuring much more territory.]

;W[fj];B[mk]LB[li:a][ki:b][mg:c]C[This looks too tight.  B can get more. I prefer Ba, Wb, Bc.  B is still behind in secure territory even thought he may be able to  to win if he plays this way.  He certainly  cannot by playing B145 here.]

This means that B needs to get about 20 poitns from the remaining open areas.  This may probably be possible with the a,b,c combination but it seems unlikely.]
