C[To the reviewer: I've included a couple of questions/comments, but the game speaks for itself really.  I play as black and ultimately end up resigning.  If you can, I'd appreciate if you could point me in the direction where I need to improve most - I've been around 5 kyu for a long time now, I'm looking to get closer to being a shodan.  Thanks in advance for reviewing!

Hello !
I'm your reviewer Thomas. My comments will begin with [fantomas27\] as my nickname on kgs is fantomas27.
I added a general comment at the end of the file.
I hope you will enjoy the review.

(;B[qh]C[Is this extension from the right side?

[fantomas27\] : actually both are playable];W[qm]

(;B[gq]C[[fantomas27\] : this move is wrong. (i explain later why)]
;W[hq];B[gr];W[ip]
(;B[en];W[dm]C[[fantomas27\] : this exchange is very painfull]
;B[gn];W[lq];B[nq]C[[fantomas27\] : as you can see, white played on both sides, your group is not even alive. What's more white ends in sente. Yes, white group isn't completly settled yet but since your group is not alive either, i is not a problem for white.
This looks like a disaster for black.];W[jd];B[cf]C[I played C14, not knowing where to play, not really sure if it was a good move....

[fantomas27\] : this is the last open area so this move is ok but you could also begin to attack white bottom group]
;W[ci]
(;B[ef]C[[fantomas27\] : this move is wrong because white is established on both sides so you will just end up with a non-living group]
;W[fd]C[[fantomas27\] : now you can't find a way to settle properly black two stones]
;B[ch]C[[fantomas27\] : this kind of tsuke moves is often wrong. Here is a good example :-)
Your opponent will just get stronger and on the other side, you won't get much for your side.]
;W[di]C[[fantomas27\] : now white extension is perfect]
(;B[bh]C[[fantomas27\] : with this move, you take the risk that white will not respond you because the threat behind it is not that big.]

(;W[bi];B[bd];W[cc];B[fh]LB[cc:A][ck:B]C[[fantomas27\] : ok black is alive here but what a pain !
you lost the aji of the sansan at A and the aji of the invasion at B while you got only a few points. This is very bad for you.]
;W[nc]
(;B[oc]LB[jd:A]C[[fantomas27\] : this move is definitly wrong. After that, white extension is perfect.
Tsuke here is almost always wrong when there is a white stone at A]
;W[nd]C[[fantomas27\] : white says thx. he doesn't have any weakness left. And you still need to defend one more time.]
;B[pf]TR[qc]LB[pf:A][op:B][gq:C][ch:D][fd:E][qj:F][ip:G][cp:H]
C[[fantomas27\] : let's take a look at the positions.

Black : the A group is overconcentrated.You only have tobi and keima extensions And there is still a weakness at the marked place.
The B group is also overconcentrated.
The C group is not alive and don't make any points
The D group is barely alive but doesn't make a lot of points

White : 
The E group is fine and makes a lot of points
The F group is small but should be ok
The G group is white's only weak group but not that weak because of your C group
The H group doesn't have any problem and makes a lot of points

This fast observation shows that you are a lot behind. So you have to play very agresively to come back in the game.
Moreover it's white's turn.];W[gf];B[ff]C[[fantomas27\] : this move is over-defensive and it strenghtens white top a lot.]
;W[gg]
(;B[eg]C[[fantomas27\] : this move makes horrible shape for nothing]
;W[mg];B[om]C[My intention was to press white into a low position, then invade the lower group with K3

[fantomas27\] : this is the good plan];W[ro]
(;B[qo];W[rp];B[qn];W[rn];B[ql];W[rl];B[pm];W[rm];B[qk];W[lo]
C[[fantomas27\] : now the game seems to be over bacause all whte groups look like safe.]
;B[jq]C[[fantomas27\] : this is your last chance];W[jp];B[lm]
;W[oj];B[rq];W[rk];B[ri];W[rj];B[pk]C[[fantomas27\] : white tenukied your attack on the bottom group, so you have to attack him very fiercely. Moreover this move makes extremly bad shape (empty triangle !!!)]
;W[ok]
(;B[oh]C[[fantomas27\] : here if white defend his bottom group, you lose your last chance to win the game.]
;W[pj];B[pl];W[mi];B[ni];W[nj];B[mj]C[[fantomas27\] : a little question for you : why did you play the last 3 moves ? what was their meaning ?
you are cutting two living groups, so in the best scenario you are just doing nothing but losing aji here.]
;W[sp];B[mk];W[hr]C[At this point I realize I have deliberated finishing this group off...

[fantomas27\] : it  looks impossible to kill the group now.]
;B[mr];W[lr];B[ir];W[gs];B[ko];W[kp];B[kn];W[fq];B[fr];W[fp]
;B[er];W[ep]LB[eg:A][pk:B][ni:C][mj:D][ch:E][oc:F]C[I resign

[fantomas27\] : I noticed three big problems in your style of play ; if you want to become 1dan you have to overcome them.

The first big problem is that you play many useless moves like the A, B, C, D moves for example. In the best case these moves are sente and are just aji-keshi (a waste of aji) which is already very bad but in worst scenario they are gote like A. In this case you lose sente for nothing !
The problem comes from the fact that we play very fast on the net without necesarily reflecting enough.
My advice is to wait 3 seconds before playing. It's an advice french players got from Fan Hui.

The second big problem is your shapes for example the moves A, B that make horrible shape. You should solve more tsumegos to learn shapes.

The last problem is that you play a lot of tsuke moves like E and F moves. In both cases they are moves that streghten your opponent without getting much for yourself. You should remember not to make your opponent stronger unless he is already strong.

That's all i noticed.

I hope you enjoyed the review
