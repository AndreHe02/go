C[astralos [8k\]: hi, gg

Hello, I'm Crazyone (around 2k KGS now) and I'll do my best to review your game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[qq];B[ce];W[ic];B[mc]C[I see d17+c15 as a wall, so I'm taught to drive my opponent towards the wall, and g17 would be too close.

*c15d17 isn't a strong wall, because it has some weakness around c15-c16. But you're right, g17 would be a bit narrow. L17 is a more active way to put pressure on w stone]
;W[fc]LB[gb:A][hb:B][fe:C][ie:D][je:E]TR[ic]C[*the marked stones aren't very strong, but they aren't weak either. B can't attack them hard now, but later he could chose from A to E, depending on whole board position. Playing k16 now, B destroy the possibility to attack w stones later - this is a kind of aji-keshi. It would be better to play some big move now (r10 or r6 for example) and return to the upper-left later.]
;B[jd];W[jc];B[kd];W[kc];B[ld]TR[jd][kd]SQ[pj]C[*
b gain a kind of wall, but now w group is safe, so w can play around q10 to erase b's wall. So k16 was too early (it could be ok, if b already had q10 on the board)]
;W[ee];B[dg]C[*b corner is still strong, so you can think about q10 to make your wall work.]
;W[id]C[W don't need this move. q10 or r9 is more urgent.];B[ie]
;W[kq];B[qe]SQ[jd][kd][ld][ie]C[* This is very slow and a bit inconsistent with your previous moves. You played so much stones to build an outside thikness (and strong w group instead of 2 weak stones is the cost of this thickness!), so it will be a natural to use this wall to make a moyo, starting with q10 or even q6! r15 is a territory-oriented move and now b's marked stones doesn't work (you can remove them and it wouldn't affect b's corner points). One of the main goals in Go is to make all your stone work together.]
;W[qh]C[* this is too close to a strong b position. 
There is a proverb "play away from thickness", so r10 or even r9 would be much better for w.
As for black, you must counterattack to use the power of your wall, so r10/r9 would be an active answer.]
;B[cn]C[I didnt see white getting too big right now, but I'm probably wrong.

* w isn't really big now, because there are many invasion points in w position, but you're right, it's time to think about preventing w moyo. attacking r12 stone would be a good way to do it.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[cl];W[do]C[*bad shape (empty triangle). f4 is better.]
(;B[po]C[Now I want to erase the white area. But is this the right spot to start?

*w's position is too thin to be called even moyo, so you can think not about erasing, but about invading. I would prefer to start from r9 (see variation).]
;W[pm]C[*strange move. o3 or p3 is more simple.];B[pq];W[pr]
;B[oq];W[or];B[qp]C[*this is a very important point! Now b has a good shape.]
;W[rq]C[too slow. o3 would be better, but then b will play r2.]
;B[nq]C[good to keep w low];W[nr];B[mq];W[mr]
(;B[lo]C[but this move is odd. see variations.];W[lq];B[mo]
C[This is slow too. With a strong group facing two weak stones you must think not about making two eyes right now, but about attacking.

Also remember: play away from thickness! m5 m6 is too close to your stones, so black position is overconcentrated.]
;W[hp]C[W is too gready. He must think about protecting his stones on the right (p12 or q10 for example) instead of making points in the area, where he is already strong. 

"Play urgent move before a big move"];B[jo]LB[qj:A]TR[jd][kd]
[ld][pd][ie][qe][lo][mo][po][qp]C[Seems easy to get 2 eyes. Is white letting me off too easy?

It's black, who is letting w too easy. If black play around A and split w stones, w will have enourmous problems making this stones alive. 

You must realize, that both marked black groups are very strong (much stronger, than 2 w stones), so you must attack, but now defend.

"Use thickness to attack!"];W[jp];B[qk]C[Good! You did it first and punished w for playing h4 and k4 instead of protecting his weak stones.]
;W[pk];B[pj];W[qj];B[ql];W[pl];B[qm];W[qn]
(;B[rj]C[This atari is very bad! see variation.];W[qi];B[rn]
;W[pn];B[ro];W[qo];B[rp];W[oo];B[pp];W[oj]C[White can have that stone... I'll pretent to save it later on...

*without s10-r11 exchange w wouldn't be able to connect his stones so easy, so this exchange is terrible aji-keshi for b. After w connects, b can't attack w group anymore, so this result is really sad. 

Try to avoid any exchanges, if they are not absolutely necessary and you aren't shure, they are good for you.]
;B[no]C[b is already connected around n4, so he can play  s11 to make 2 eyes (and some points) or just tenuki (f13 fof example)]
;W[on];B[oh]C[Like now...];W[oi];B[ph];W[pi];B[nh];W[ri]C[I can make an eye even if white plays s9, right?

Right, but anyway, a mere making  eyes instead of attacking w is a very poor result for a b's attack, started from r9. The territory around o14 isn't a good compensation too (but still better, than nothnig)]
;B[qg];W[rk];B[rm]C[But somehow I forgot about that and just connected.]
;W[op]C[now b has only 1 eye and w can gain something on attacking b group. So it was better to not forget about s8 ;)]
;B[mi];W[mk];B[ll];W[io];B[jn];W[he];B[if];W[dj];B[ci]C[This was probably wrong...

Yes, it seems bad to let w cut through your position. If you want to play actively, you can attack w stone, starting from f8.
If you just want to live without problems, b10 would be the right move.]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[bk];B[bi];W[ck];B[bl]C[Now I've let my groups been cut in two

This is very bad. Instead of attacking w weak stone, you made a weak group yourself. W invasion was successful]
;W[al];B[am];W[ak];B[ao];W[dl];B[bn]C[Better to make eyes, or run to the center with e8 and e7?

Making 2 eyes "in situ" seems better.];W[em];B[cm];W[el];B[bp]
C[This move is a big yose - good! 

Currently w has fround 45-50 points and black has around 65, so b is ahead.]

Yes! When you're so strong around, you can play A to kill for sure.]

;B[rd]C[W can't capture r18r19 stones (b will capture q10 first), bo you can play t14 of t13 instead of this move!]

I can't find anything, so h10 instead of g9 would be better (see variation)]

[fj][dk][ek][fk][gk][hk][fl][gl]C[w +12 in the marked area, so you lost 6 points by playing g9.

So maybe some unnecessary moves in the end, but maybe I missed a big move somewhere else?

Yes, there was lot of unnecessary moves in the end. If you will read in the endgame more carefully and avoid such a moves, you'll become 1 or 2 stones stronger!

Thanks for submitting this game for a review. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask (mail to goplayer83@gmail.com).

Good luck and play strong!

P.S.: sorry for my bad english - this isn't my native language and I made this reivew in a hurry.

Best wishes!])
