in this case ajikeshi! if he played at 'a' he already
gets the corner stones...
this is why the market move was wrong];W[ec]C[now white is safe :)];B[cc]

;W[di]C[question 1: is d11 or a move around m16 better?  black clearly has two weaknesses here, i was just not sure which one was better to take advantage of.
this looks like a good move, it was strange not to play here earlier
around m16 is maybe too optimistic at this moment, you will
have chance for this later. d11 more urgent i think.];B[bi]MA[ff]LB[ff:A]
C[submissive? i think he should discard one stone, and run, at 'a'.];W[bh]

[fi];B[fe];W[gd];B[ff];W[ek];B[mr]LB[md:A][qq:B][gr:C]C[question 2: how should i respond to this?  i don't like the move in the game becuase it 1. solidifies black, any weaknesses in the corner are gone, 2. sente, but leaves behind some weaknesses, and 3. lacks fighting spirit.  it gives up, conceeds the jump into my territory.  where is a better play?

i don't think defending here is worth it, reason is, he has
got moves like 'c', and you won't make so many points
anyway. you could maybe play a testmove at 'b' to look what
happens, but i would play 'a'.
the way you played in the game was indeed bad, all his corner
was safe after.];W[nr];B[nq];W[mq];B[or];W[lr];B[ns];W[og];B[ng];W[qm]C
