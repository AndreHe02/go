C[B: hi, my name is Bart and I'll try to review your game. My comments start with B:]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[cn]LB[cc:A]C[B: because white ignores you here, you can later play at A.]
;B[cl]C[B: good to pincher here.];W[en];B[fp];W[bp];B[cq]LB[el:A]
C[I'm thinking I should have jumped out at A instead of trying to guard the corner. If he goes for the corner, I confine him. If he jumps out again, I could either get some fourth line territory or block the corner. Either way, I end up with some nice influence on the left side of the board.

B: jumping out at A doesn't really put much pressure on the white group, especially when white then gets the corner. And it's hard to confine him when there is already the stone at E6.]
;W[ci];B[el]LB[ci:A]C[B: good, if used to put pressure on the lone white stone A.]
;W[bm]
(;B[do]LB[dm:A]C[I probably should have peeped at A instead to thicken the group in the middle.

B: yes, but white can still try to go underneath towards the lone white stone. So I'd prefer to block at B8. Peeping also makes white stronger, which you do not want.]
;W[dn];B[bl]LB[qf:C][qj:B][kq:A]C[I have no idea why I did this, securing the left is not going to be easy now, and I could probably claim the bottom at A or right at B or C instead.

B: it's not only about securing the left, it's also about your groups that may be in danger. If you lose the left side, you lose more than you can gain on the bottom or right side.]
;W[bq]
(;B[cr]LB[iq:A]C[B: possible, an alternative is A.];W[br];B[qj]
LB[dj:A]C[B: right now, it better to see if there is a) a black group in danger, or b) a white group you can attack, before playing a big move. A move around A would strengthen your group and attack the white stone.]
;W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[pn];W[ql];B[pl];W[qq]
(;B[pq]LB[qp:A]C[I probably should have played at A instead to cut white off from his friends, and get a wall facing upwards to go with the wall facing to the left.

B: yes, splitting doesn't look good for white.];W[qr];B[pr]
;W[rp];B[kq]LB[dj:B][jp:A]C[B: looks like you have a wall about 6 stones high, so you can also jump to A. Or play around B and let white decide to invade or not.]
;W[jp]
(;B[iq]C[I self peeped here. I'm not sure how I was supposed to respond to this.

B: I'd play solid under or to the right of the stone. White must go to the center, or try and link up his stones to the left. You'll get some thick territory on the bottom. And you get sente. See variations.]
;W[jq];B[jr];W[ip];B[hq];W[hp];B[gp];W[kp];B[gn];W[fm]C[B: idea to put pressure on white is good. Downside for this play is that you let white put pressure on your stones on the left.]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[mp]C[B: this works out , but usually it's better to just extend (N3).]
;W[mo];B[np];W[no];B[oo];W[mq];B[nq];W[mr];B[kr];W[nr];B[oq]
;W[or];B[os];W[lr];B[ir];W[eq];B[ep];W[fr];B[dr];W[ks];B[gq]
;W[gm];B[hn];W[jm]
(;B[hm]C[B: good, keep white separated. But again, beware of your own stones on the left.]
;W[gk];B[lo]C[B: doesn't work, as you found out.];W[ln];B[ko]
;W[jo];B[mn];W[kn];B[nn];W[lo]
(;B[in]C[B: it's good to take away eyespace. Be aware that white can still run towards the center and is therefore hard to kill.]
;W[fn];B[go];W[ml]
(;B[mm]LB[lm:A]C[Maybe should have thrown in at A to prevent the second eye?

B: throw-in doesn't work. See variations you already started.]
;W[lm]
(;B[ll]LB[kl:A]C[Still could have thrown in at A

B: then white plays M8 and has two stones toward the center, and you end up with 1 or 2 weaker stones.]
;W[kl];B[lk]C[B: so this is fine. You get something on the right side., and white lives with a few points.]
;W[jn]C[B: that doesn't make white alive. K8 makes the eye false.]
;B[mk];W[dk]C[B: ouch, that's what I was afraid of. You can still attack white, although it will be a difficult fight.]

(;B[kc]C[B: good, but I'd prefer to approach the corner first.]
;W[nc]C[B: a logical respons by white.];B[hc];W[gb];B[hb];W[gc]

(;B[lc]LB[qg:A]C[Right side of the base was safe. Should have played at A. Instead, white takes that area on the next turn.

B: yes, or started move 95 at P17, which gives you a better result.]
;W[qh]C[B: white plays it a bit loose. Not sure what the best approach is, but there might be something to gain there. I tried some variations.]

(;B[oi];W[pi];B[pj];W[oh]
(;B[nj];W[ni];B[oj];W[nh];B[qi];W[ph];B[mi];W[me]C[B: white is definitely ahead now. Huge corner.]
;B[ke];W[lg]C[B: the black top group will probably be allright. So maybe  focus on the left part now.]

(;B[he]C[B: starting from the left side for example. See variation.]
;W[gd];B[hd];W[gg]C[B: now white threatens to close your left group in. The top group still has enough eyespace.]
;B[jg];W[ih];B[kh];W[lh];B[ki];W[jj];B[li]C[B: connecting the groups is good if you feel unsure about how your top group is doing. It this case it's not needed and your top left group is in more danger.]
;W[kf];B[jf];W[le];B[kd];W[cc]C[B: now white threatens your left group.]
;B[hk]C[B: no time to play elsewhere. B17 or B12 is a must, I think.]
;W[il];B[hl];W[gj];B[gl];W[fl]C[B: good idea. Try to follow up on it. Maybe get your left group out, or strengthen your top left group. See variations.]

(;B[ij];W[hj];B[ik];W[jk];B[ii];W[hh];B[ji]C[B: as said earlier, it's good to connect your groups if you're unsure if they can live on their own. But your bottom group is very safe, so you have more urgent moves waiting in the (top) left.]
;W[dg];B[rl]C[B: second time to ignore the left. Or maybe you've given up on those stones? If so, good to play elsewhere. If not, make white try his hardest to get them.]
;W[rm];B[rk];W[sn];B[ge]C[B: if playing endgame, there are bigger moves and the edge of the groups, G19 for example. Or N18, or S12.]
;W[fe];B[gf];W[ff];B[hg];W[gh];B[ig];W[cg];B[rh]C[B: good.]
;W[rg];B[ri];W[rf];B[sg]C[B: not good. Try to play the sente moves first (the ones white will respond to). So first N18, G19, R1.]
;W[sf];B[sh];W[bc];B[md]C[B: see previous comment.];W[nd];B[mb]
C[B: good!];W[nb];B[na];W[mc];B[lb];W[ob];B[oa];W[pa];B[ma]
;W[pb];B[ga]C[B: good!];W[fa];B[ha];W[eb];B[bs];W[ar];B[cs]
C[B: no need to play there. Take another move, e.g. R1. You were doing great endgame moves.]
;W[co]C[B: although you lost, it was a good game. And if the ratings are correct you played a 4 kyu stronger opponent in an even game, which is difficult.
Good points: sense of where the big points are on the board, attacking weak groups, most of the endgame moves.
Things to improve: playing urgent moves before big moves, knowing when a group is (probably) safe or not.]
