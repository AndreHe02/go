C[Hi! I'm wjzz and i'm 12k KGS. I played this game as black on KGS and i won, but im dissatisfied. I havent played sanreisen for a bit, and dont know if i played using it optimaly. I would like you to show me my mistakes and my bad strategic concepts. Thanks in advance for your time!

Cyrik: Hi, I'm Cyrik, currently playing as Vivex, 4k KGS. Thank you for the oppurtunity to review your game.

This was an exciting game, with several reversals and good thinking on both Black and White's part. Black, in general, did a fairly good job reacting to White's invasions, and managed to recover from a bad fuseki and turn White's invasions against him, exploiting White's slowness in the later game to turn the game into a big Black win.

I'll give my best ideas and thoughts, but don't take them as absolute by any means. I'm still learning. =b]
;B[pd];W[pq];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd];W[jp];B[pj]C[Cyrik: Not unplayable by any means, but I'd prefer an approach to your move here. This seems too slow to my tastes - you let White take the initiative. Q-5, R-5, or C-6 are what I'd play.]
;W[qf]TR[pj]C[Cyrik: This is the wrong corner for White to approach. The marked stone makes it unreasonable for White to approach here.]

(;B[qe]LB[oe:A][po:B][qo:C]TR[pj]C[I played this beacouse of the marked stone, but was it good to push this stone?

Cyrik: It's joseki, thanks to the marked stone. However, your follow-up was lacking - joseki is in the variation. However, in this case, I wouldn't play this move. A seems more in line with your sanrensei opening, which is an influence-based rather than territory-based strategy. R-15 shows a territorial attitude, aiming at securing your corner. Pushing at his stone from a distance, esp. from A, builds up your fighting strength while forcing him to run.]
;W[pf]
(;B[ne]LB[nd:A]SQ[ld]C[Cyrik: This move doesn't put much pressure on White, nor does it secure much for you. It leaves behind a weakness at the marked point. If you want to strengthen the upper side, A is your best move.]
;W[qi];B[pi];W[qh];B[ni]LB[qj:A]C[I wanted to make a good shape, but now it looks quite slow. What would u recomned instead?

I would recommend A instead, with the follow-up either approaching White's corner to make shape, or a move around your actual move, putting pressure on White's group.

In any case, allowing White to take A is one of your biggest early mistakes.]
;W[qj];B[po]C[Cyrik: A good move in this situation, trying to directly contain White's upper stones is a futile gesture at this point. You need support from farther away to keep White from owning this entire part of the board.

A better move, though, would have been to prevent White from getting R-10.]
;W[np];B[qq]
(;W[pp]LB[ql:D][qp:B][or:C][qr:A]C[I dont like this move, but it seems that it was good for white.

Cyrik: It is overconcentrated, the white stone at O-4 is too close. White A, Black B, White C is joseki, while Black D makes shape for you and prevents White from getting all over the board.]
;B[qp];W[oo];B[pn];W[on];B[pm];W[om];B[ol];W[nl];B[ok];W[rl]
;B[rm];W[ql]C[Cyrik: This sequence was rather bad for you. You gain about 13-15 points in the corner, and manage to enclose that pesky White group, but White gets to counteract your center influence, make secure lower territory, and gets sente.]
;B[qm];W[ln]LB[cf:B][df:C][dj:A]C[White made a big mistake giving up sente for this move - better for him would have been A, B, or C. After any of those, it would be a very difficult game for you.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[gp];B[dj]TR[ln]C[And in 4 moves, you've gone from a bad to a very good position. If you had a stone at tengen, I'd say it was game over for White. As it is, he's going to have to get desperate. Good job taking advantage of the White mistakes at M-6 and C-5.]
;W[cf];B[df];W[ce]LB[cd:A][cg:B]C[I see this move often, but in my joseki dictionary (Kogo's joseki) there is no such move, how to handle it?

Cyrik: I'm not sure about all the continuations, but I'd say either A or B.]

(;B[de]C[Cyrik: This is too submissive. It lets White take the corner and destroy any hopes for significant territory along the side. 

You do, however, increase your already-significant center control. Tengen is looking very attractive.]

(;B[dl];W[gc]C[this invasion was quite good for white, but could u tell if i did handle it a correct way?

Cyrik: You were too soft on White, and allowed him to get eye space too easily. This white stone has no support, and can only run towards your black stones. Don't let it expand out. See variations for a couple of examples of how to attack this stone.]

(;B[hd];W[ec];B[dc];W[gd];B[he];W[ge];B[gf]TR[hc]C[Cyrik: Should have been at the triangled point]
;W[ib];B[hb]C[Cyrik: A mistake, this does nothing for you.]

;W[ed];B[kk]LB[ke:A]SQ[kd][je][hf]C[i have known about those weeknesses, but i were sure that i have the ko, so im safe. in the game white havent tried to use them so i now im not sure if L9 was correct, or i should play 'a'

Cyrik: Absolutely you should play A. The weakness is too big to be ignored, especially at L-16. If White plays L-16, even the Ko can't save you. You got very, very lucky here. See variations for the many many ways White can punish you.]

C[Cyrik: Good. Take advantage of White's timidity.];W[eo];B[bh]
;W[bf];B[cl];W[bi];B[mm];W[nm];B[ph]C[is this move sente? i mean, should white save those three stones?

Cyrik: Absolutely not. The white stones have no effect on the life of the white group; saving them is worth about 7, eight points to White. Far better for White to try and break up that huge center territory you're building. At this point, it would be tough, but there are definitely moves worth more than the points from the three stones.]

(;W[nk]LB[bl:A]C[to me it looks like a big mistake. i would play G7 instead.

Cyrik: Certainly it's a mistake. It's worth 1 point in sente, when there are very clearly bigger moves. White A, for example. Or G7, though A is bigger.]

[sp][rq][sq][rr][sr][rs][ss]C[Cyrik: A very interesting game. You managed to exploit several White mistakes very effectively, completely turning the game around. 

I would advise you to work on two things:

1) Play defensive moves more often. They're painful to make sometimes, but much better to play a move like L-15 early on, than let your opponent take advantage of all those weaknesses you left behind. Against a more aggressive opponent, I'm not sure whether you would have won.

2) Don't be so soft on your opponent's invading stones, esp. when they have no support and you completely surround the stone. White's invasion at  G-17 should not have worked. Deny eyespace whenever you can, especially on weak invading stones.

I hope my comments have helped.])

1) The last two moves, especially black 8, should only be played if the area beneath your three black stones are interesting. In this case, it really isn't - neither side can gain much in the lower right by playing the next move.
2) White 9 splits your two groups of black stones apart. You can expect your lower stones to come under attack at some point later in the game.]

(;B[oe];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pg]C[Cyrik: After something like this, White realizes his mistake in approaching this corner. Black's strength towards the center is enormous, while White has gained a small, enclosed corner. White has other options, but none of them give a very good result for him.]
