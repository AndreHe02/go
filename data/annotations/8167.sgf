C[This is the game from "Moscow Cup". I won it, but it was hard - my opponent just lose some stones in the end of the game.
Time control was 1hour + 3x30 byo-yomi. My colour is white.

Forfun (hereafter ff) - Thanks for providing an interesting game for us to study. It was a lot of fun to dig into.  My impression is that White struggled somewhat in the early going.  This seemed to be caused by making "normal" moves without really considering the consequences and without having a clear idea of what to aim at.  This led to Black obtaining a comfortable position that was easier to play than White's.  In the middle game White managed to turn things around by out fighting Black.  I would like to concentrate on a few key positions in the early going.  Let's look at what White should have been thinking at the time and what alternatives existed to the plays chosen during the game.]
;B[cq];W[qd];B[dc];W[pq];B[od]
(;W[oc]C[What joseki I shoud choose? I think after this black gets big influence

ff - If White plays in this corner, this is the normal choice.  The alternative is to not answer here but play immediately in the upper left corner.  See the variations.  But playing this way expects the result in the game.  This is by far the most common joseki when White plays P17.  Looking just at the position on the top side, P17 is the most common choice seen at the professional level.  Clearly the pros do not consider the influence that Black obtains to provide any advantage.]
;B[nc];W[pc];B[nd];W[qf];B[jd]C[ff - Black has an OK position at the top.  However, the relationship with the D17 stone is not perfect - D17 is low versus the top side.  White has not made a mistake here.]
(;W[de]C[ff - This is perhaps a little too close to Black's position.  C14 is much more common in professional play.  See the variations...]
;B[dh]C[ff - This sets out to use K16 in attacking.  White is somewhat uncomfortable.]
(;W[fe]C[ff - This is a little difficult for White, or it should be...]
;B[fc];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[bb]
(;W[cj]C[ff - This might be better played high at D9 or D10.  Playing low when the lower left corner is Black runs the risk that Black will be able pressure this stone.]
;B[cn]C[ff - This seems rather tight from a 3-3 stone like C3.  The usual E11 would let White extend down the left side, but that is not so interesting against C3.  Nevertheless, the challenge is now for White to successfully attack the stone on D12.]
(;W[fi]C[ff - This is too far.  Black easily cuts through White's shape.  This is a key point in the game.  It is not clear what White intended with this play but Black easily plays through the gap between the White stones.  The first step to improving is being aware of why we chose to play in a particular way.  The second step is understanding whether or not our expectations were met by the game result.]
;B[dj]C[ff - The natural reply.  What else, if anything, did White expect here?]
(;W[dk]C[ff - This play has no impact on the Black position in the lower left, so White is just helping Black.  If this is what White expected at the time of playing F11, then White's understanding of the game situation is flawed.  This is inevitably a big loss for White.  F11 can not be a sensible play if this is the follow up.]
;B[ej];W[ci];B[eh]C[ff - F11 is now badly placed, a wasted stone.]
;W[ch]C[ff - I think this is perhaps the most important point in this game in terms of studying.  What has White achieved since playing F11?  White is connected along the left side.  However, the position is still open toward the bottom and the top.  Realistically White has not secured much over 10 points.  In return, Black has played at both the top and the bottom.  In addition, Black has cut off the F11 stone and made good shape in the center.  We should understand that this is a poor result for White that should not have been pursued.  We do not know what White was thinking when F11 was played but it seems that there was no special consideration given to alternatives to D9 when Black played the very natural D10.  To improve at Go we have to train ourselves to anticipate poor results.  Only then can we train ourselves to avoid them :-)

It may be that White was feeling that connecting the lone stone on C10 to the upper left group was a good/necessary result here after Black played C6.  However, the C10 stone was originally an attacking stone played against D12 in exchange for Black securing the top side.  If White has to sacrifice a stone in order to secure the connection after Black secures the bottom left as well, the overall strategy of attacking D12 was questionable.]
;B[ef]C[ff - This is an overplay by Black.  It fails to anticipate White's best reply. It should only strengthen White. See the variations...]
(;W[cf]C[ff - White lets Black force here.];B[ee]C[ff - A success for Black.  There is still some bad aji here from a later White play at E16.  However, this is a remote possibility so Black is very happy with the result on the left side.]
;W[fp]C[ff - White wants to prevent Black from extending in front of the two-stone formation.  However, this gets too close to Black's position.  White probably felt pressured to avoid falling behind after Black's success on the left.  Nevertheless, White would be better off to play calmly and wait for later chances.]
;B[kq]C[ff - In turn, Black pincers from too far away.  Although Black has O3 next, which looks like a stylish play, letting White play at J3 is too soft.  K3 or so looks much better.]
;W[iq]C[ff - White wisely settles the stones here];B[nq]
(;W[qo]C[ff - Since R14 is already low, this looks slack.  P4 would be an uncompromising play that puts pressure on the two Black stones in order to expand the right side.]
(;B[ek]C[ff - This is from the wrong direction.  Black has nothing to fear from a White play  here since the lower left is strong and Black would be happy to be pushed into adding to center..]
(;W[dq]C[ff - If White plays anything around here, the key point must be to end in sente in order to play against the two Black stones on the bottom side.  In fact White needs no reinforcement here yet.]
;B[dp];W[dr]C[ff - More natural would be drawing back to E4.  The threat to play C2 is very large and the White stones end up with fewer defects...]
;B[ep]C[ff - This is natural and helps Black to play away here without any worries.  White can jump into the corner later but that will not threaten Black as a whole.  Playing here adds some meaning to Black's earlier E9.  It becomes very difficult for White to threaten these stones as there is a connection available to the top.  Meanwhile the possible support from a White extension at D8 is cut off.]
;W[fq];B[og]C[What should I do now with this big moyo? Maybe this moyo is a result of my mistakes?

ff - I would say that White has allowed Black to set the pace in this game.  The question is not what to do about the moyo but, indeed, how to improve White's earlier play so that Black does not have the opportunity to create such a moyo.

Let's look at the board:
- On the right, White has made two classic shapes in the upper right and lower right.  However, they are both low (R14 and R5 stones) so they do not coordinate well.
- In the bottom left, White has constructed a shape that has some well-known defects while ending in gote.  If Black later plays down at C2, White will be vulnerable to attack through E3, E2, G2.
- In the upper left, White has built a low position in exchange for Black's large wall facing the center.

Overall White should be dissatisfied with the situation.  The fact that White wins this game in the end is a testament to fighting spirit from this point on.  White should want to improve in understanding the direction of play in the early stages of the game and the overall balance across the board.]
;W[no]C[ff - This is a good idea.  White needs to search for weaknesses in Black's position and use them to naturally reduce Black's moyo.]
;B[ko];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp]C[ff - Pushing through immediately is essentially saying that M3 was a bad play that can be directly exploited by White.  This is not obviously true here.  White would be better off to treat M4 as a probe and leave the situation as it is for now.]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[jp];W[lo];B[jq]C[ff - The reason that White should hesitate to play L4 immediately is that "forcing" Black to play this stone significantly weakens the group to the left.  White may regret this in the future.]
;W[pj];B[pd];W[qc]
(;B[qh]C[ff - Black decides to cut two strong stones R14 and Q10 apart.  This is not going to be a fruitful idea!]
(;W[qi]C[ff - White decides to block off the right side.  This decision should be based on a count of the territory that shows White will be ahead if Black encloses the center while White encloses the right.  That might not be true in this situation.]
;B[ph];W[mi]C[ff - White is too fond of the large knight's play!  :-)  This is the same issue as F11 on the left side.  In this case, however, Black's shape is weaker and White's is stronger.  Most importantly, White is ready to fight!]
(;B[oj];W[oi]C[ff - Yes! White has to be willing to fight.]
(;B[kn]C[ff - Black retreats from the fight.];W[oh];B[cr]C[ff - Strategically this is a mistake by Black.  White is "forced" to strengthen these stones with J2, which greatly weakens the Black stones here and affects the later fighting in the center.  Black should want to play J2 rather than C2.]

)
(;W[dl]C[ff - White does not feel like playing here immediately because it accomplishes nothing in this area and just invites Black to play B8 as a forcing move.  The reason that it accomplishes nothing is that the two White stones on the bottom side are not under pressure.  Nevertheless this move may become a good play if Black plays against the bottom stones in the future.  The fact that this play remains available means that the bottom stones have various resources and will be difficult for Black to attack.]
