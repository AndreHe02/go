AB[pd][dp]C[Hello !

Thank you very much for reviewing this game.

I'm Peej (black) in this game played on kgs.
Time setting was : 25min + 5 periods of 30 sec

During this game, there was a big fight in the middle. I managed to win this fight because my opponent made a mistake. But I feel that it is a fight I should have easily won. I think that many of my moves are bad moves in this fight but I don't see where the good ones are.

Finally it was a close game, although I won this big fight in the center. My opponent resigned before the end, but I think I would have won by only 10 points.


P.S. I'm French, so please excuse me for my bad English];W[pp]

Hello, and bonyour!

Don't worry about language.

I am from Bosnia, so we are on similar positions.];B[dd];W[qf]
;B[nd];W[lc];B[qh]C[>> In this position,  is making a pincer at J17 better ?

> Bob:

It is better to play on J17 as you are stronger on upper then on right side.
Also, as you are in front as a black (plus with handicap stones) better is to strengthen your position then attacking at once. 
In handicap games white just enjoy in dividing and fighting.]

(;B[ld]C[> Bob:


Is that what black needs in this position?

No.

For my point of view still it is better  to avoid conflict.

N15 for black and wait for white's next move.

This move helps white in upper side as you know : 
contact moves promote settling  groups.

(;B[dn]C[>> I played this and J4 with the idea of attacking the P11 group.

> Bob:

It is optimistic to think in that way as black in this position.

What I mean is that white is still alive with his center group, besides  black is still in front with points.

You may choose also E6 here aiming to make more territory on the bottom side while attacking center white group later.

For me it was better for white to go  E6 except B4 with his last move.]

(;B[fo];W[bo];B[fl]C[>> To capture the cutting stone, but the white territory in the corner seems too big, but I don't see what I could have done

> Bob:

One can say you have right, but nobody can say that you finished this game now.

Off course, white has to straggle for victory as black is still in front .

If you look better on this position it is easy to see that B8 was excellent move.
Now, black can easily continue with his plan to make territory while attacking center white group.]

(;W[eq]C[> Bob:

Sometimes we are so greedy.

White is going to slowly with this move.

This is not so many points as you think.

Sometimes you have to invest in future. 

Good investment for black.];B[ji]C[>> Starting the attack on the white group

> Bob:

Nice.];W[lm];B[nk]C[>> Is this move good ? I don't want to let white make good shape, but maybe there are better moves

> Bob:

No, 

good move.

Proper timing.];W[nj];B[ml];W[ll];B[ko];W[ol];B[nl];W[om];B[on]

Good decision. Also black have to make territory while taking pressure on white.]

> Bob:

Loosing this group for white is loosing the game.

But for black ?

It is likely that you have been lucky here as different result also has been possible after this fight.

My advice to you Peej is something like >

Try to be more patient at the very beginning of the game.
