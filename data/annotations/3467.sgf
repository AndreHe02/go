C[Pls review for white.

It is a pity for me to lose by just half a point...

Did I make any end-game mistakes?

Pls comment freely, point out my mistakes, I really hope to learn and not to repeat them.

Thanks in advance.
JH : both players are strong and played well. As a reviewer, 4 Dan, I may point some dubious moves even if I may have played them in an actual game as you get stronger when you review.]
;B[pd];W[cc];B[pq];W[dq];B[pk];W[cn]C[Could white K4 be better?
JH : K4 is also possible as O17 but your shimari is quite OK.]
;B[jp];W[po];B[qp]LB[mo:A]C[I am thinking of playing white A too.

Is it better?
JH : Both possible and played by pro.];W[op];B[oq];W[mp];B[nq]

C[I think black A or B better?

Q7 is trying to attack a light piece...

Am I right in this case?
JH : Not sure. White is light but still under attack. So 27 is a good point. A and B are also playable]
;W[lp];B[kp]C[This is obviously a mistake by black.
JH : Till now, no big mistakes. This 29 is a big slip indeed ! ( < 10kyû)]
;W[mq];B[fq];W[do];B[lc]C[B33 : looks a bit early. A corner move seems usual.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[nf];W[ld];B[kd]LB[mf:A]C[Could white A be better?

I am not so sure about the right fighting shape here.

;W[kg];B[ge]C[B47 : may be too easy for white but not bad.]
;W[fd];B[ch]LB[ef:a]C[B 49 : I have the feeling that a play at "a" is better as Black can later fall under attack]
;W[hq]C[W 50 : sharp];B[hp];W[gq];B[gp]C[Can white play J3 here?

I think it looks risky.];W[fr];B[iq];W[lr]LB[fp:a]C[W56 : unnecessary and letting Black play "a"]
;B[fp];W[hr]LB[gr:a][ir:b]C[W58 : Better at "a" as "b" is sente.]
;B[kq]C[B59 : a bit dubious. Why not jumping in the center.]
;W[io];B[ip];W[om]C[Is white P7 a mistake?

Maybe Q6 better?

What is the best move here?
JH : I think you loose too much here. R5 is the regular move]
;B[pn];W[on];B[qo];W[pl];B[ol]C[B 67 : No need to play here for black. Playing underneath is better.]
;W[ql];B[qm]LB[rm:a]C[B69 : bad shape. Rarey good. Better at "a"]

C[White 78 : looks good enough but "a" is also playable];B[rh]
;W[ml];B[nk];W[rn];B[sk];W[sj]C[White 84 : Alive. Good];B[ce]
;W[jb];B[ck];W[fe]LB[dg:A]C[Maybe white A better?
JH : 88 looks OK];B[ih];W[mk]LB[fg:A][kc:a]C[White A better?
You can take profit cutting at "b". Black looks behind.];B[ff]
;W[gf]C[No need to fight here. It gives Black a chance.];B[gg]
;W[hf];B[he];W[ef]LB[df:a]C[96 : White should combine something and keep this atari in reserve. When 2 atari are possible , don't play atari says Fan Hui 2p.
What about "a"];B[fg];W[de];B[cf];W[eg];B[cd];W[dc]C[After the capture of 92 and 94, Black has recovered a little.]
;B[mj];W[lj];B[mi];W[kn]LB[kk:A]C[White A (instead of L6) better?
JH : I don't think so. 106 looks OK];B[nr];W[mr];B[gm];W[dh]
;B[ci]LB[kc:A][bl:B]C[White A or B better?
A is big. You try to play in the center where there are no points.]
;W[fi];B[gi];W[gj];B[kb]C[B115 : Good even if it looks a bit dangerous.]

;W[ji]C[Is this sente? I think i could have misread here...

If not sente, I should have play B6...

JH : I think you could try A. Idon(t see how can Black live]
;W[ic]C[W138 : Not big anyway.];B[ka];W[ma];B[if];W[em]LB[hn:a]
C[My last hope is to kill this group...
JH : No you can also map the center with "a"];B[in];W[jo];B[ho]
LB[fn:A]C[White A better?
JH : difficult];W[gn];B[fn];W[fm];B[hn];W[fo];B[go];W[eo];B[km]
;W[ko];B[ir]LB[er:a][is:b][cr:c]C[B155 : Better to play once at "a" as after 155 "b" or "c" could be sente]
;W[er];B[hs];W[gr];B[hl]LB[im:A][gk:a][kl:b]C[Should white attack at A?
JH : Not very clear. A seems possible but Black will get an eye with "b" and "c".]
;W[jl];B[fl];W[gk];B[gl];W[el];B[jm]LB[im:A]C[Bad misread, can white A be a kill here?

What is the best sequence for black?

Black 165 should be at "A". I f White plays at "A", it  looks dangerous. May be white chance to do better than a kô]
