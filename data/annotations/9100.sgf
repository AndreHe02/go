C[Hello, Alex,

I am Bernd, European 2d, HonFu in the GTL and other go places.

Sorry, this review comes remarkably late, probably you have forgotten about the game already. 

Also maybe I am not perfect to review this game, since we are not so much apart from each other in rank (GTL seems to have a shortage of strong reviewers). 

I hope you will find something helpful in my comments anyway.

Okay, let's go!];B[pp];W[dd];B[oc];W[dq]
(;B[cf]C[i'm really bad at fuseki so any comments on this subject will be halpful :)

Hon: In the fuseki, basically you have to understand the direction of your stones, what they "want". Your stone in the upper right corner is putting emphasis on the upper side.]
;W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci]C[Hon: With this sequence you have reduced the value of the upper side, because White has got a solid, living group there now.

Along with the direction of stones, the degree of solidity is an important factor in the fuseki. You always play away from strength, like living groups or walls, no matter if it is your own strength or that of the opponent. Instead you try to force your opponent into the direction of strength.

Why do we avoid strength? Because if there are solid groups already, then there is little potential for growth. It is an inefficient place to be in. And it might also be dangerous to have your stones standing close to a solid enemy group.]

(;W[pe]LB[qd:A]C[Hon: To know how to answer an approach move in the corner - that is which joseki to play - you have to look at which side is important and which is not.

Unimportant are sides where there are solid groups on the third line, because there is not much potential. So the upper side is unimportant here. 

Important are sides which have unfinished positions still wanting development. So the right side is more important here.

Another important point is always the territory in the corner. Normally white would approach at A, but here he played Q15, giving the corner away. It is locally very attractive for black to just accept this offer..

Can we find a joseki that combines all this?]
(;B[of]TR[fc]C[Hon: With this move you press the white stone from above, aiming at the upper side. But the upper side is not really important, as we know now.]

(;W[pc]C[Hon: I tried alternatives for this, but it is rather confusing.]

(;B[od];W[pd];B[oe];W[qg]C[Hon: White got a lot of points in the corner now (too many, you should not readily give points on the fourth line). Also White closed off his group on the 3rd line, making the right side uninteresting. This is bad for the stone in the lower right, which wanted to develop there.]
;B[ic]C[Hon: Black gets a position at the top, but he is getting it where white already lives. Better would have been to take the right.]
;W[bc]
(;B[do];W[jd]C[here i don't really know if i to cut like i did in the game, or to connect to my p17 group

Hon: Since Black didn't jump, White gets to play here. Black will only have around 10 points, less than white in the upper right, although he invested one stone more.

So of course you would like to attack, but White is solid left and right, it will be impossible to hit him hard. 

I think the mistake was that you went for this direction in the first place. Black's position seems already a bit difficult to handle.]
;B[id];W[je]
(;B[jc];W[ld];B[kd];W[ke];B[kc]
(;W[lc]C[Hon: This looks like an overplay.];B[le];W[me];B[lf]
;W[mb]
(;B[pb]
(;W[qb]C[Hon: White answers this. But then why has he played N18 in the first place?]
;B[mf]C[Hon: So Black can still tidy up.];W[ob];B[nb];W[pa]
;B[nc];W[na];B[md];W[mc];B[if]C[Hon: White didn't play best, so now your group has more influence than it should have.

It is funny - White has gained very little, while Black's points have not really changed. But the thickness to the center is incredible now!]
;W[dh]LB[dj:A]C[Hon: As a reduction, A would be better, away from the strength.

But with this kind of move, White seems to be aiming either to increase influence (obviously not possible) or to attack that black fortress at the top (beyond insane).]

(;B[ef]LB[ch:A]C[i'm makeing a lot of bad Decisions in my games , is this one of them ?

Hon: You let White cut through at A, where you deliberately extended towards earlier. And you do this to reach out a helping hand to your top group - which clearly needs no help at all. At first glance this move looked awkward to me.

On the other hand, white has no base and is isolated between your lower left stones and your top side stones, so at second glance it does make sense! (White's move was not good to begin with.) It is a strong move, saying: "So you want to attack me? Let's turn the tables!"]
;W[ch]C[Hon: On THIRD glance ...

I think White should not have continued here right away. At this moment it's obvious that the fight is good for you, so White can't move now; he should leave the single stone right where it is. 

You have not defended against C12. It was better for White to leave D12 there like a sort of time bomb, hoping that you get problems there later. Which is not too likely, but ... well, maybe it is one argument for my variation.]

;B[ee];W[gg];B[hf];W[gd];B[hh];W[af];B[gh];W[ad]C[Hon: Locally this is a marvellous exchange for you. White captures you for around 20 points but you get very solid center influence. D5 is in a great position, too.

The Japanese make a difference between shibori (squeeze) and shimetsuke (what you did here). In many joseki variations you can capture some stones, sometimes even a lot, but if one side can plaster the other in like you did here, then it is almost always considered bad, if not a catastrophy. 

Capturing for only twenty points in an area that was played out and solid anyway, at the same time giving you super influence towards the open, undeveloped areas of the board, that was plainly bad.

Okay, that kind of thing is easily said, but ... White has more than 50 safe points without komi now. You still have to build up your influence and transform it to territory. In terms of territory you haven't got a lot - yet! 

Personally I prefer to be on the territory side, because the uncertainty - will my influence be enough or will my opponent live all the points away somehow - can be so annoying. But this looks really nice for black anyway. You have sente too.]

(;B[fp]
(;W[co]
(;B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fr]C[Hon: With this joseki you look a bit too tight on the left side because of C5, and White crawls out at the bottom where you still would have liked to develop (Q4).

But you are still growing, growing ...];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq]TR[kh]
[jk][in]C[Hon: Before White's next move, let us count.

I count about 65 for White including komi. 

If we assume that Black keeps the territory beyond the marked points, he has something below 60 in this moment. But It is not easy for white to find the right reduction point now. I've been looking at this position for quite a while now, but I am not sure if I should reduce directly or just approach the lower right corner, and from which side, or what I should do else as White.

I find it hard to handle for White and overall it looks likely that Black will gain more points than White in the rest of the game.]

(;W[il]TR[ng][mi][lk][km][jo][ip]C[Hon: This is too deep. Black is super strong and White came in way beyond the moyo line.]

(;B[kl]C[does g8 better?

Hon: No, this is a great point. 

G8 looks like a game-losing move to me (which would be a pity after white had already lost the game strategically after suffering the shimetsuke in the upper left).

You are super solid here, and the left edge is rather tight, so there are not too many points at stake (see variations). 

After your cap, white is surrounded by strong black walls. White is just asking for getting destroyed.]

C[Hon: This looks a bit risky to me. You are trying hard to kill him; but after you connect at A, will B become a problem? 

Probably you read out all of that; it is sometimes easier to see these kind of things when you are playing the game yourself.]

;B[kj]C[Hon: Okay, here it is really over, you would need more than a few beers to still lose this.

White started an unreasonable fight on the left side, got squeezed terribly and made you super strong. Then he went in too deep and - game over. 

Nice shot! :-)

You said you were bad in fuseki, so I hope that my many comments about direction, strength and joseki variations gave you some useful impulses.

;B[el]C[Hon: If you answer, white has destroyed another 15 points. 

But you don't even have to play this! Even if White jumps in once more (while you get three moves elsewhere), you will have a few points left.

White was definitely too greedy - or panicky - coming in this deep. He probably looked at your huge influence and thought "omg". But even so, this just doesn't work. And didn't work, too.]
))
(;W[ll]TR[ng][mi][lk][km][io]C[Hon: This would be the standard reduction point, right in the middle of the influence and just a bit outside the "doorstep" of the moyo.

;W[df];B[ce];W[dg]LB[ac:A]C[Hon: Let's say, you just go along with white. Who has profited from this?

You are solidified now, your group can not be attacked any longer, you even saved a stone and got the endgame A for later. But what is White's wall doing? It is pointing right where there's no potential at all. So White gave something (even sente!) and got nothing in return.

I think, this is good for Black - safe and simple.

;W[er];B[ep];W[fq];B[dr];W[cr];B[fr];W[ds];B[gq]C[Hon: After you became solid on the left side, the lower side (still with your Q4-stone) was most important.

(;W[mf]C[Hon: White should just let you connect.];B[lc];W[md]
;B[ob];W[pb]C[Hon: Let's say you answer here (there may be other options). We can now look at the efficiency again.

Black has played 11 stones at the top but can only hope for 7 points.

White has also played 11 stones, but already has 15 points in the upper right. the center group doesn't look like it will get problems, so it will have at least 2 points too. 

In the upper left White has spent one move more, but it is a valuable endgame and no waste. The rest of the board is even.

Black has sente, but I still think, White has a good game already.]

(;B[kb]C[Hon: Normally you connect with this move. After that you can aim to attack the floating stones.

Probably this is the best course from here.]))
(;B[ie]C[Hon: To develop the top now, black could play here. It looks big, but it is just about 20 points. How many points does White have in the upper right? Around 15. But Black has used two whole moves more to get only 5 more points!

In the process, potential on the right was destroyed and the black group on the left side was harmed. 

The Black group has influence, but it doesn't do much, squeezed in between the strong white groups. It has become a territory game, in which White is ahead and has sente, so this is already a lead for White. 

Anyway, if you play the wall and the extension, I think you almost need this move so that the former moves don't go to waste.]

;W[sc];B[ne];W[od];B[nd];W[sd]C[Hon: If it comes to this, Black gets influence towards the upper side and the center, while White lives small in the corner.

Black's shape is looking a bit silly with N16 and P14, while White (since Black can hardly connect the four stones now) has something below ten points in the corner. This thing looks a bit awkward to me, but directionwise and with the empty triangles probably better for White (don't quote me in front of a professional, though ^^).]
