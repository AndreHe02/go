C[lebernard [15k\]: hi gg
gstevens31 [14k\]: hello, gg


Hello,

Thank you for reviewing my game.   I played white on KGS where I am 14k  and my opponent was listed at 15k and I lost by 17.5 pts.  I was surprised by the center point black play on Move 3.  This game was strange for me, I though black was very aggressive locally and he outplayed me in local skirmishes while I was trying to take a whole board approach as much as I could.  I know I lost a group on move 274 which cost me the game in the endgame phase which I could have saved.  I also seem to leave lots of weaknesses and would appreciate any advice on avoiding those.  Also did I tennuki appropriately?

Thanks,
Greg

Hi,

Im Stefan Heyder, from Germany, Im like 5k atm =) Lately I havent played that much but I hope that I can answer your questions properly. If you have any further questions feel free to mail at : heyder.stefan@gmail.com.

Stefan];B[pd];W[dp];B[jj]C[GS -wasn't sure how to handle center point,so I ignored it.

SH- This move is pretty strange as it doesnt take corners as you would do normally in an opening. Black will use this stone to aquire a big moyo or use it as a ladder breaker. As black it is viable because you usually get two corners, whereas as white I would not recommend that move. You can ignore it right now, but have to be carefull not to give your opponennt a big moyo or run into a ladder that doesnt work.]
;W[pp];B[jp];W[dd];B[fd];W[df];B[ee]C[GS - should I have answered the peep?

SH - I think you should have. If you answer the peep, you have secured some territory and you can follow up by playing near Q16, denieing black a big moyo.]

;W[cb]C[GS- trying to secure my group.

;B[dg];W[cg];B[dh];W[ch];B[ei]
(;W[dj];B[ej];W[ek];B[cq];W[cp]C[GS - did I block the right side?  I thought I had a better opportunity for territory on the right side.

SH - The block is on the right side, because a wall to the other side would not threaten K4.]

;B[en];W[qf];B[dm];W[cl];B[el];W[lp];B[fk];W[dk];B[al]C[GS - I know these are end game moves but I felt I had to respond.]
;W[ak];B[am];W[bk];B[fq]
(;W[fp]C[GS - Bad cut?  better to play elsewhere or F2?

SH - You should play something like  K3. Connecting your stone to your group. E2 is dead, because black is simply too strong.]

;B[jk];W[kk];B[hl];W[of];B[ik];W[nd];B[kl];W[oc]C[GS - R17 better to prevent invasion?

SH - It was very good from you to ignore the black moves. There you could try P17 at K16 in order to get a larger territory. At this point black has nothing except the one corner. You have one corner, 2 edges and more.]
;B[jl];W[kj];B[kn];W[lm];B[ki];W[li]C[GS - I thought things were going well and just had to play even and slowly work into the top.  In hindsight I gues R4 and R 17 would have spared me the invasions.

SH - Yes they would have. But as you will see, the invasions dont work. Imagine a stone at K16 and see how big your territory and moyo are. Until now everything is going very very well, you are ahead by 70 points maybe.]

In conclusion :

You had several chances to win. Actually you were ahead the whole game, until you didnt see the selfatari.
You could have been a little more agressive, shutting down blacks moyo. Also for the invasions, if you read a little bit further you see that black almost always is dead. Just train your life and death and your reading abillity a little bit, so you dont fall into traps.
