C[Hello, thanks for reviewing my game!
Somehow I was under attack the whole game and ended up with about 40 points less.

[DP OK, we need to look at how W managed to beat you up.  Having reviewed the game, it looks like W is more than 1 stone stronger than you, so that was always going to be hard.  Try to consider the whole board with your position, in particular to decide the direction of attack.  Don't forget the essential defensive moves.  Usually it's just one move you've omitted which has then caused trouble.  Most players play too many defensive moves - you might have managed too few!\]\]]

(;B[ie]C[[DP OK, this is where things started to go wrong.  Your response lacks "fighting spirit".  W has played a double hane and doesn't really have the strength to do so - you need to keep a lookout for moves like this\]]
;W[gf]C[[DP W is breathing a sigh of relief and hurrying to patch up his defects...\]]
;B[qj]C[i think this was my first mistake. Instead of making a double wing, should I have extended somewhere at the top N17 for example?

[DP No, there is nothing inherently wrong with this.  It's the answer to O17 which needs examining\]]
;W[nc]
(;B[pf]C[[DP Nope.  This is a serious blunder because a) you have a weakness at J17 and b) you've already extended at R10.  This position cries out for the tight pincer at M17 to prevent W getting a base, after which W should invade the corner\]]
;W[kc];B[jq]C[next mistake: letting white play J17 gets my group into bad shape and lose its base

[DP Well, actually the mistake is earlier by allowing W to get a base!\]]
;W[ic];B[hd];W[bc];B[cb];W[fb];B[fc];W[gb]
(;B[jd]C[[DP I don't like this - it doesn't really achieve anything except to strengthen W.  Better to make a base for your stones\]]
;W[jc];B[kf];W[le];B[lf]C[[DP B's moves are helping W, but not gaining anything\]]
;W[me];B[mf];W[nf];B[ne];W[ng];B[oe];W[oc];B[pc]C[would O10 have been better?

[DP O10 would have been bigger scale, and would have used the stones already played in a better fashion, so yes - even though the corner would be big to lose. \]]
;W[ph];B[oj];W[rg];B[re];W[qi];B[ri]C[[DP Containment would be better than all out attack.  M10 would allow W to live small but give you loads of influence in the centre\]]
;W[rh];B[pi];W[qh];B[rj];W[oi];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj]C[[DP All these contact moves simply strengthen W, and so seriously weaken your J15 stones.  Attack from a distance\]]

;W[hc];B[eb];W[ib];B[fa];W[ha];B[bb]C[[DP you are lucky W doesn't answer this more viciously and start a ko for the life of your group\]]

(;W[cc]C[[DP big mistake by W letting B off the hook here\]]
;B[ab]C[was this move necessary to live?

[DP err, yes, see the ko sequence earlier!\]];W[cn];B[qq]C[i thought the 3-3 invasion would be a good idea, considering the black wall in the middle-right and the stones on O5-O7

[DP This is wanting to have your cake and eat it.  Either you let the corner stone live and squash it from the outside so you can kill M8 group, or you invade and W will build up outside strength so he can connect and live.  You can't have both!\]]

C[[DP Now, W is alive\]];B[lr];W[ns];B[po];W[im]C[after this move the left side goes to white

[DP nope - there's lots of aji left here - see the sequence for how to break through\]]

(;B[lk];W[jl];B[pj]C[another mistake, would G4 have been better?

[DP Well, if you've not seen the sequence on the left, then you're a fair way down in territory, and so something like B5 and G4 might go some way to getting you back into it\]]
;W[mm]C[[DP doesn't achieve much for W - better N11 to secure all his stones\]]

[DP well, there is - there's the aji of your J9 stones which will help. But C3 is probably good here\]]
