;B[pd]C[Hello Jean-Michel

this is the first time that i work with MFG, so i hope this will
be a useful review.
if you miss some comments, please request.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]
;B[pk];W[jp];B[jd];W[dj];B[mp];W[km]
(;B[po]C[jmf : this move seems a little bit slow, isn't it ?

It is slow, but it is no a bad move];W[nc];B[oc];W[ne]LB[lc:A]
C[W14 is not common.
i think you should play A]
(;B[pf];W[hc]C[looks like the wrong direction];B[ic]LB[lc:A]
C[Still A];W[hd];B[jf];W[kc];B[ib]C[Now black has no base];W[kd]
LB[ke:A][ng:B]C[W22 helps black
A or B is better];B[ke];W[le];B[lf];W[me];B[nb];W[mc];B[ng]
C[This sequence was very good for black.
White should jump to 29 with every of the last four move.

Now white is closed in. Even if he lives easy, this is bad for
white];W[mg];B[mf];W[od]
(;B[pc];W[of];B[og];W[pg];B[qf];W[nf];B[oi]LB[ph:A]C[jmf : is this move correct ?

i would prefer A, but i can not say which one is better];W[ni]
LB[ph:A]C[now A is better shape];B[oh];W[ie];B[je];W[ig];B[lg]
;W[mb];B[kj]C[black can be satisfied];W[pm]C[very aggressive]
;B[ol]LB[qo:A]C[jmf : i really wonder where is the best move in this case

49 is ok
A is an other idea];W[qp]
(;B[pp]C[the right side is bigger

i would say 51 was the biggest mistake in the opening];W[qo]

(;B[qq]LB[rm:c][qn:b]C[jmf : s8 better ? or something else ?

b is one other possibility i see, but ....

c is good shape and i think also a good move];W[pn]C[b and c are better
black secures territory and white can not live local]
(;B[nm]C[if white lives on the side, black gets nothing in return]
;W[rk]LB[ql:A]C[A is better];B[ql];W[rl];B[qm];W[rm];B[qn];W[rn]
C[b puts more pressure on white]
(;B[ri];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp]C[this was a lose for black];B[cn]
C[jmf : at this point, W seems to be ahead, his invasions have
been successful.

yes];W[co];B[dn];W[fq]
(;B[dl];W[ck];B[cl];W[cf];B[fi];W[fk];B[bm]C[jmf : necessary, i guess. Maybe too slow

i think it is good to play solid. When you have two weak groups
it will be very bad;   maybe 75 was to fare,

on the other hand in this position black has not much to lose]

;W[ed];B[ge];W[fd];B[if];W[hf]C[black must come in to the white territory without strengthen
white to much.

b looks like a good idea]
(;B[ii]C[jmf : bad move, it doesn(t do anything];W[hh];B[hi]
;W[gi];B[gj];W[gh];B[fj];W[ij];B[ek];W[ji]C[white gets good thickness in the centre]
;B[ci]LB[mh:A]C[A can become dangerous];W[di];B[dh]C[fine technique

i think B on C12 works too];W[ch]
(;B[eh]C[jmf : B11 instead ?

hmmm yes?];W[bh]LB[ej:B]C[The cut at B is not protected.];B[cq]
;W[cp];B[bo];W[bp];B[ap];W[aq];B[ao];W[bq]C[109 looks strange now]
;B[bk];W[bj];B[gp]C[jmf : where should i have played this move  ?

this move was not the problem];W[fp]C[what about b now?]
(;B[ip];W[lp]C[some other ways]
(;B[mq]C[jmf : too slow, G5 instead ?

G5 is slow too];W[fn];B[gl];W[jq];B[gn];W[gm]
(;B[hm]C[Atari from the left site is better, but will not win the game.]

;W[in];B[jn];W[jo];B[io];W[hn];B[lo]C[black gives up to much]
;W[lq];B[jk];W[ki];B[lj]C[jmf : B has to get some territory in the center, but it is an
overplay, so i guess the game is already lost...

149 is not possible;  White is ahead in territory and should win anyway]
