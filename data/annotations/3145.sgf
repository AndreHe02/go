AB[gc][cg]C[Human strength is 16 Kyu. Computer playing at level 2 

 Black's comments/questions start with "George:"];W[gg];B[cc]
C[George: I feel I should have played this closer to the center. Perhaps at D6. 

Can be, but the computer can play then C7 in other moment.]
;W[eg];B[ee];W[dh];B[hf]C[George: This starts a common chain of moves that I often see between me and Igowin. 



This is why i dont play with computers, they are bored];W[hg]
;B[ig];W[ih];B[if];W[hh]C[George: Often Igowin will play H1 instead. 

Is the same];B[ff]
(;W[fg]C[well, i will not make critics of the way the pc plays]
;B[ce]C[George: Uncertain about this move here.];W[df];B[gf]
C[George: This move was played so my small group to the right didn't get cut/captured. Again, was this optimal? 

G4 is needed];W[cf];B[bf];W[cd]C[George: I think this is where things start to go bad for me. I have no idea how to properly respond to this invasion. 

Your response was not bad i think];B[be];W[bd];B[de];W[dc];B[dd]

(;B[ec]C[B8 is the move here];W[bb];B[ca];W[eb];B[ad];W[ch]
;B[bg];W[gb];B[fb];W[ba];B[ea];W[da];B[cb]C[George: The goal here was to keep White from making an eye. 

but white have 2 ees now no matter what];W[fa];B[fc];W[hc];B[ae]

C[George: This probably wasn't necessary at the moment, was it? 

Not necesary, the game was over];W[ac];B[ia]C[George: Looking back on this, I have no idea why I played here. 



To lose a point in gote, thats the reason :)];W[ha];B[ca]C[Well, George, try to play human players, they are less bored than computers, you will have more fun]
