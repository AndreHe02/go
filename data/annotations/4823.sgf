AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,

i hereby request a review of this game for white.
It has been played at 10-Jan-2006 on IGS between dalsung[21k?\] as B and jug[myself,19k?\] as W.
Edited SGF with cgoban-2.6.12.

* Info about the game:
19x19 with handicap 2 stones, Komi -5.5, with time limit (10min + 10/25)
Actually i haven't played many handicap-games (was my 3rd), so sometimes i was a little helpless,
and B opponent was strong in keeping connections.

* Info about my reviewing:
I've included my review-comments (mostly at the move before the played move).
Included my thoughts along with questions starting with label 'JUG'.
Maybe you can add reviewer comments starting with a prefix you prefer.

What i would expect:
- best or possibly working play at moves with labels ?
- i included some of my "understandings", if these are flawed, please correct them
- correct and/or show better ways to cut/connect
- there is a summary from myself at the last move, please add what i should concentrate on for improving in handi-games

Thanks in advance for your effort of reviewing this game, Kind regards, jug.

LB[gc:C][kc:E][de:A][ee:D][ef:B]C[When playing white in a handicap game, it is necessary to make moves that you know are silly and too far.  While you may know that the move over reaches, by the fact that your playing a handicap game your oppenant doesnt know everything you do.  I am not saying treat your oppenant with no respect and make blatantly extended moves, but if you would normaly make a 2 space jump try a 3.  and so forth.. always try and eek just a little more than normal out of your moves.  It's important to be safe, but always remember you are behinad and have some catching up to do.  A common method of catch up is capturing a dragon, but against someone who understands handicap play all you can shoot for is grabbing territory more efficiantly than the other guy.  


In this move I would probably go A.  I would try and fight over the corner and get a gauge of the oppenants knowlegde of joseki and life and death.]
;W[de]TR[cb][cf]C[great minds think alike.  You also had the theese options if you would like to sart a fight.  But i prefer your move as it is safe and keeps a firm hold on the controls.]
;B[ce]LB[gc:2][hc:1][kc:5][dd:3][gd:A][df:B][cg:4]C[A is to high on the board, you lose the territory you started claiming if Black dives under.  

B is to small a move in my opinion.

1grabs territory and is safe but you lose initiative.

2 is safe but another loss of initiative.

3 is too small but the most safe.

4 if you want to continue the fight.

I think i prefer 5, it keeps the pressure on him.  Keep in mind that my route would lead to a fight over a dragon.]
;W[gd];B[ie];W[df]LB[cb:1][dg:2]C[I would have rathered 1, or 2, bother larger. you could also have simply moved on to somewhere else on the board this group is feels alive why not press our oppenant elsewhere.]
;B[cg]LB[cb:A][nd:B][gf:C][qf:D][cn:1][dn:2]C[i've alerady expressed my view on A and i feel the same about C.  B is a good idea, I like it on the fourth row.  

D pressures Black to run for support strengthening the two stones in the center.  

I would have gone in 1, 2, or B. I like to keep the stones balanced across the board and presently it feels very heavy up top while the bottom is all empty. Probably 1.]
;W[cf];B[bf]LB[cb:B][cc:A][gf:D][dg:C]C[The opening of the game is about claiming space.  To me this fight feel settled enough i think you need to grab more space elsewhere.  of your choices, I would pick A or C as both demand a replay and this game is all about not leaving the choices up to the oppenant.]
;W[cc];B[bh]LB[mc:D][nc:C][nd:B][qf:E][gg:A]C[I like B it leaves you with a lot of mobility.  E is a very bad as we have covered already.C and D are to low i think to feel safe about.  While it might seem like a good idea to cut at A i think there is plenty of space and time to cut there later.  It seems more important to deny black all that territory at the top.]
;W[gg];B[mc]LB[pf:B][qf:A]C[Of your choices B, but I would be moving above Black to mitigate the amount of space he actualy captures.]

(;W[qf]C[JUG: hm. 1 stone vs 4 (better not induce re-inforcement here) ?

yeh, laying a stone here is like walking up to an army alone and asking them to surround you.]

[ij:H][mj:I][ik:J]C[JUG: mistake at 'A', Bs reading was superior
may work to attack 'J'-group to get strength to attack NW-group

Though not played, the plan should be to connect Ws big groups (NW & SE), then SW-corner, but where to get the territory ? That's unclear to me.

What to aim for ?

Don't let him in your side.]
(;W[re];B[qe];W[pf];B[rg]LB[rc:A][me:B][jh:C][ei:D][ij:E]C[JUG: hopeless, need something to attack ('C' too calm)

C leaves the open space your claiming to open and isnt pushing on anything giving the openant initiative.  I dont know if this is recoverable at this point. I probably would have resigned, but against a weaker player in a handicap game the key is to start a bunch of fights and out read him.  So far all your contact with him led to him making stronger and well designed groups where life seems certain.  Try not to force your oppenant to defend and completely finish his defenses.  Stab, parry, jump to the side stab,parry, jump again and try and not broadsword swing so he puts up his shield.  You want your oppenant to think he has you blocked so when your ready you can start to kill things.]

now B is ahead by about 40p and W has not much places to reduce B that much

The remaining game is not very interesting (result is clear at this time), so please rush to the last-move-summary.]

jug: great game (handi-games are really difficult ;)
jug: thanks

summary:
- left too many weak groups in fuseki
- fuseki / middle-game: use sent to keep on attacking, but when to secure groups ?
- must stay connected like B does (all B is connected, W 3 groups + 3 killed)
- need better reading regarding connections


I think the biggest thing you need to work on is seperating the the Method of the game from how you play it.  Fuseki should be spent attacking, but attack while connecting and stabling.  attacking does not have to be only an attack.  A good move is both offensively very strong and defensively very strong.  Try and make moves that balance both offense and defense the whole game.  Focus less on trying to win by a large margin, as attacking only attempts, but instead try and win by .5.  Make each of your moves .5 bigger than the oppenants.  You only need that .5 to win, dont over streach yourself going for big reaches and gains.  Moreoften people bankrupt themselves rather than prosper upon that route.

Keep playing and you will get better. practice is the most important factor at your level of play. Keep it up, and you'll advance quickly.  It's been a pleasure reading your game.

Be well,
Silvus])
