C[Hi, this is Rick Mott (about 5k) doing the review for Black.  All my comments are tagged with a leading RM.

You played a good game.  You have a general tendency to want to start complicated fighting (wedges and so on) without fully understanding the consequences.  Your game would be better if you keep the end goal in mind (defending a moyo, attacking a group) before starting the fight.  You had several opportunities to put the game away by simplifying the situation when you were ahead.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[cd];B[pk];W[ec];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[bo]
C[RM: This is a bit odd.  The normal continuation is to pull back at C4.]

(;B[eo]C[RM: I think this is too easy on white.  Black shouldn't fear the cut overmuch.

I like the variation shown better.];W[bn];B[eq];W[dp];B[ep]
;W[bq];B[cm]C[RM: Very good sequence for you.  Big outward facing wall, restricts white's potential on the left.  So far the game is going black's way.]
;W[er];B[fr];W[dr]
(;B[jp]C[RM: Leaves a weakness.  I'd rather see the wall completed properly at G3 (variation).  If white invades, you will welcome the opportunity to attack.]
;W[nc];B[nb]C[RM: Practically begs white to split your stones at P17.]
;W[oc]C[RM: Which he does.  Better to strengthen your Q16 stone with Q14, R14 -- even a contact play at P17, although I prefer not to force white to strengthen his own stone.]
;B[pc];W[ob];B[pb];W[mb]C[RM: Fortunately, white spent three more moves capturing one stone, so you come out ahead anyway.

The direction of play suggests the left side is the important boundary between black and white territories.  You could also do something to strengthen the upper right (e.g. R13), which is defensive but huge.]

(;B[qh]C[RM: Reasonable.  I'd go a stone higher, but this is one of the critical areas.]
;W[ne]C[RM: Over concentrated.];B[dd]C[RM:  There is a play here, but this isn't it.  Believe it or not, it's to play under the C16 stone at B16.  The idea is that you will make white choose the corner or the outside.]
;W[dc];B[bd];W[ce]C[RM: White gives you the corner.  He should have played B17.]

(;B[cg]C[RM: This leaves you with three separated stones, which is not good.  Better would be the variation from the previous stone.]
;W[bc]C[RM: The vital point.];B[bf]C[RM: Ok, making best use of the remaining aji.]
;W[be];B[eg];W[ee]
(;B[jg]C[RM: Wow.  I think you're trying to make this stone do too much.  I would prefer to take some more solid profit by sealing in the white group at the bottom with B7.  See variation.]
;W[je]C[RM: But White is passive here.  You're getting the best of the game so far.]

(;B[fd]C[RM: No point to this, it just makes white solid.  Better B7 or O13 to close up the big gaps in the moyo.]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[ff];B[ef];W[gf]C[RM: This whole sequence is unnecessary for you, and white winds up with a way to jump into your moyo.]

(;B[hd]C[RM: Against reasonable play you should not live here.  The big play for both sides is G12.]

(;W[he];B[ie]C[RM: This doesn't work, as we see immediately.  You still want to support the moyo with G12.]
;W[if];B[jf];W[id]C[RM: And now white is strong enough that you can't prevent him from breaking in, while giving away points at the top.]
;B[hc];W[ic]C[RM: Just making him stronger and stronger with no hope of two eyes.]
;B[hh]C[RM: Too late.];W[gh]C[RM: Hits the right point.];B[fg]
;W[gg];B[bm]C[RM: Saving what you can, but this would have been better earlier before all the fighting at the top.]
;W[hi];B[ii];W[ih];B[jh];W[hg];B[ji];W[hj]
(;B[dj]C[RM: This is the small side -- maybe 15 points.  You should play on the other side where the potential is much greater.]
;W[hl]
(;B[ho]C[RM: Again, secures a small area (16 points) when 30-point moves are available.  Always look to enclose a bigger area.  If you want to go for territory immediately, how about completing the corner enclosure in the lower right?]
;W[hn]
(;B[gn]C[RM: Again, protecting on the smaller side.  You really want to hold the moyo on the right to counter white's big top area.  See variation.]
;W[in];B[ip];W[kn];B[mk]C[RM: This move doesn't do you much good.  With white stones above and below, it's hard to make territory.

Much better would be to continue to stake out territory at the bottom, or strengthen the bottom right at someplace like R6 or Q6.]
;W[qo]C[RM: But white gets there first.];B[mq]C[RM: Good, could be one line higher at N4.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[rq]
(;B[oo]C[RM: No prospect of extra territory.  R7 is big, because it's a double-value move; it prevents white from extending to R8.]
;W[rr]C[RM; White misses a chance here.  You should ignore this and play R7.]
;B[pr];W[ql]C[RM: Big for white.  At least a 10-point swing.]

(;B[qn]C[RM: You won't come out of this with sente.  Better to block simply at R9.  You want sente to be able to play (for example) N5.]
;W[pn];B[rm];W[qm];B[po];W[rn];B[rk];W[rl];B[qk]C[RM: white has sente.  Big difference.]
;W[on]C[RM; But he uses it poorly, forcing you to strengthen yourself with no benefit to white.]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[ln];B[kk]C[RM; See the variations at move 91 for better ideas.]
;W[ng]
(;B[nf]C[RM: Too eager to start complicated fighting.  Better to peep at P14 and just make territory in the upper right.]
;W[mf];B[mg]C[RM: you're letting him make a pon-nuki in the middle of what might have been your territory?!?]
;W[of];B[nh];W[mh];B[lg];W[oh];B[ni];W[oi]C[RM: Ok, this sequence is where you lost the game.  If you had played simply to solidify territory in the upper right and center left, you'd have won easily.]
;B[oj];W[nj];B[mi];W[nk];B[nl];W[ok]
(;B[ol]C[RM: Why not connect at Q`0?  Ir's sente for you; white must escape or you'll catch the three stones.  See variation.]
;W[pj];B[mj];W[oj];B[pg];W[og]
(;B[ml]C[RM: Not needed.  You can connect these stones at either end.  Better to make territory in the center left with F8, for example.]
;W[pl];B[qi];W[qj];B[rj];W[pf];B[qf];W[pe];B[qe]C[RM: And white ends with sente.  Bad for you.]
;W[el]C[RM: And he finds the right point.  Playing in this area first was your last chance to win if both players finish out correctly from here.  The score estimator has white up by 6 points now.  Still playable for you, but you would probably lose with correct play by both sides from here on.]
;B[gm];W[gl];B[hm];W[im];B[il];W[ik];B[jl];W[fm];B[nn]C[RM: Excellent!  Good reading!]
;W[nm];B[no];W[om];B[mm]C[RM: Wow.  You're back in the game now.]

;W[io];B[gp];W[cf];B[bg];W[fh];B[eh];W[df];B[ld]C[RM: A bridge too far.  L15 is good enough; this won't work.]
;W[lf];B[ke];W[kf]C[RM; See?];B[jd];W[ie];B[ig];W[hh];B[jc]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[lc]C[RM: White figures out you can't make eyes on either side after this.]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[op];W[kg];B[lh];W[kh];B[ki];W[jk];B[jj]C[RM: Oh, no...  You have to prevent the cut at L8.]

;B[li];W[gk]C[RM: Also unnecessary.];B[ij];W[hk];B[hb];W[ia]
