C[A few mistakes and not a clear view of the board in terms of when to play where. A clear loss but quite unnecessary though. Please advice !!

Many thanks,
Lothar.

MM:  Hi Lothar, it will be my pleasure to review your game.  I hope you find my comments useful -- but keep in mind that I'm only 7k.  I will focus mostly on Black.
   I used to put lots of variations in my reviews, but I don't do that so much any more, for two reasons.  It gets confusing and time-consuming, trying to navigate them.  Also as I get stronger, I keep finding embarrassing mistakes I made in the reviews, and obvious moves I missed.  So now I try not to leave so much evidence.  ;-)  However, if you have a questions about any particular move, write to me at tacomagofiend@yahoo.com and I will try to explore it in more depth.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[fq]TR[ec][ed][fc][fd][po][qo][qn]
[pn]C[MM:  This is not necessarily a bad move.  But orthodox fuseki theory says that approaching a symmetrical corner -- a 3-3 or 4-4 -- is less urgent than approaching an asymmetrical corner.  So probably you should play the enclosure near R5 or the kakari near E17, before making approaches to the D4 stone or enclosures near Q16.]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[iq]TR[cq][hq][gq]C[MM:  Looking in Kogo's Joseki Dictionary and Ishida's Dictionary of Basic Joseki, I don't see this move.  Known joseki moves are C3, H3, and per Kogo's, the Korean innovation G3.  So maybe Black can gain an advantage.]
;B[kq]C[Wasn't sure what to play here.

MM:  This looks fine.  White has no room for a base on the side, so must jump toward the center.  You should be able to harass the resulting White group profitably.]
;W[io];B[hp]TR[fo][ko]C[MM:  Badly timed, a little heavy-handed.  You force White to make the connection she wants to make.  You don't connect your own stones, and you don't make a bigger base for yourself.  I think F5 or L5 instead.  Soon you will need C3.]
;W[ip];B[cq]C[Good.];W[ck]TR[ho]C[MM:  Big, but I question White's timing.  H5 looks like the move.]
;B[mp];W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[fo]C[MM:  Looks ok to me.];W[eq]
;B[fr];W[er];B[es];W[dq]C[MM:  White forces you to settle your stones, hurting the J3 group.]
;B[br];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[gn]TR[pk][qk]C[MM:  This move seems small.  The corner has only one eye, but can run to the center.  Something near R9 seems best to me.]
;W[im];B[hn]C[MM:  I don't like this - again you force White to make the connection she wants to make.]
;W[in]C[Seemed to work out well ?

MM:  Black is safe enough and has a big group to chase.  I would say Black is ahead at this point.]
;B[gl]TR[pf][qf][pg][qg][pj][qj][pk][qk][pn][qn][po][qo][ec]
[ed][fc][fd][jd][jc][ic][nc][nd][md][mc]C[Looks slow now.

MM:  Very slow.  The east looks huge still, and the north is still empty.]
;W[qn]C[MM:  Too bad, White got the first move there.  Perhaps the best thing to do is put pressure on the J3 stones to build thickness, then use the thickness to attack the east.]
;B[po]C[R4 better ?

MM:  R4 would claim the corner.  I'm not sure if that's better.  This looks ok to me.]
;W[rp];B[qj]TR[pn]C[MM:  I like this, but I think I would play Q6 first.]
;W[qr];B[qq];W[rq];B[pr];W[rr];B[qo]C[MM:  Again you force White to connect.  This only reduces White by a point or two, and eliminates possibilities that might arise later -- if nothing else, it is one less ko threat for you.]
;W[ro];B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[fc];B[pg]TR[nc][nd][mc][md][jc][jd]
C[MM:  This is good.  Near O17 or K17 would also be good.
Personally, it would be hard for me to resist trying to kill the floating White group in the south.  But it is safe enough, with one eye on the bottom and lots of room to run.  Therefore trying to kill would be a mistake.  When you do attack, your goal should be to limit White to a small area while you get big walls, which will help you make territory in the center and the north.  So play surrounding moves on the outside that will force White to answer inside for a small life.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[Q17 better ?

MM:  It's hard for me to say.  This lets White live in the corner; usually a player who gets 3 corners is ahead.  But if you take Q17 and the corner, then White's north and west are pretty huge.  All in all, I think your move at M17 is correct.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[qe]
C[MM:  This seems aji-keshi -- destroying your own future possibilities for the sake of a point or two.  I think you can should this for now.]
;W[re];B[pf]C[MM:  The center is becoming huge.];W[rg];B[qg]
C[MM:  No, ignore that dinky move.  Use your thickness to box in the one-eyed White group.]
;W[rf];B[rh];W[jc]TR[ic]C[MM:  Good sense of the big point.  Maybe too close to Black's thickness, and leaves a weakness near H17, so probably J17 would be better.]
;B[md]C[MM:  This feels slow and too close to the wall.  "Play away from strength."]
;W[kb];B[lb]C[H17 better ?

MM:  I don't think so at this point.  One move earlier, H17 instead of N16, would have led to complicated fighting where your wall should give you the advantage.  But after B N16 and W L18, I think B at H17 is tougher.  It is still there for the future though, depending on how the board evolves.]
;W[hd]TR[dh][ih]C[MM:  Or maybe White will make a slow move to fix it, giving you sente for something near D12 or J12.]
;B[je];W[lq];B[lp]C[MM:  No, don't give White the forcing move at L4.  Play L4 yourself instead.]
;W[kr];B[lr];W[jq];B[mq]C[MM:  No, L4 is still better.];W[jr]
;B[is];W[kp];B[lq]C[mistake L5 much better.

MM:  Yes.];W[ko]C[MM:  Ok, White has one eye.  Where do you play to keep the pressure building, and also make profit?]
;B[ln]TR[km][kl][jk][ik]C[MM:  I would play L7.  But maybe one of L8, K9, or J9 is better.  You should aim to box White into a small area.  That way, if it turns out you cannot kill, at least you have fenced off a big chunk of territory for yourself.]
;W[kl];B[kn]C[MM:  L7 is better I think.  You cannot destroy the eye here, because you need two moves to do it.  So better to threaten the L8 keima.  Also you can make points in the west.]
;W[jm];B[ik]TR[mk][lj]C[MM:  Good, cut off the escape route.  But... now White will run through your center in search of room for a second eye.  So I would say something like N9 or M10 might be better.  This is becoming a high-risk fight.]
;W[jk];B[il];W[ji]
(;B[ij]TR[jl]C[MM:  You will have to break this habit of peeping without profit.  That's the third or fourth time this game.
I think the White group is safe now, though the cut at K8 looks interesting.  Probably it was always too big to kill.  Unfortunately, you have chased it into what could have been your center territory.  Hem in from the outside, and make the opponent live small while you live large.]
;W[jj];B[jl]C[MM:  I think the cut does not work, now that you have forced White to connect at K10.  Bad J10 peep, bad.]
;W[km];B[kk]C[big mistake...!

MM:  Well, at least you have good fighting spirit.];W[lk];B[kj]
C[yes it gets worse!];W[li]C[MM:  Good net by White.];B[mj]
C[Then I tried to fix it.. and guess what ? Yes even worse]
;W[lj]C[MM:  Just so you know... don't make frownie-faces with a backslash in the comments of an SGF file.  The "\" character tells the SGF reader to ignore the next character, which happened to be the square-bracket that separates one move from the next.  As a result, my software could not display this move until I figured out what was wrong with a text editor.]
;B[ll];W[ml];B[lm];W[mk];B[nj];W[cg]C[MM:  Good timing, good placement by White.
Interestingly, even after the failed attack on the big White group, White is still not fully alive -- Black can throw in at L9.  But since White can still easily connect, it does not pay to continue the attack now.]
;B[kh]C[MM:  Oh no, another badly timed peep.];W[ki]C[White is out in several directions now..]
;B[kk]C[MM:  I guess you saw the throw-in.  But since White can just run to the northwest, why do it now??  Wouldn't it be better to block White's escape path first?]
;W[kj]C[MM:  Bad move by White.  That stone cannot escape, so there's no reason to capture now.  Black has sente.  It will still be tough to cut off the escape path, but it's probably worth trying, because otherwise Black seems behind by roughly 30.]
;B[mh]TR[hf][hg][ig]C[MM:  Wrong direction, I think.  It's too complicated for detailed analysis, but my instinct is to try something near H13.]
;W[jh];B[lh];W[if]C[MM:  With this, I think Black has lost.]
;B[ig];W[jg];B[jf];W[ih];B[hg];W[hh];B[gg];W[gh];B[he];W[fg]
;B[hf]C[Unnecessary.. many other moves available.

MM:  True.];W[fi];B[kc];W[jb];B[id];W[hc];B[ic];W[ib];B[jd]
;W[nm];B[nn];W[mm];B[dl];W[cl];B[dm];W[ej];B[cm];W[bm];B[dk]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[bj]C[??];B[fe];W[ff];B[gd];W[gc];B[de]C[too far..

MM:  Maybe so, but you're maybe 15 or 20 behind, so you have to try something outrageous.  You might make a living group or a seki in the corner, if you get two moves in a row, or maybe you will be able to cut off the 4 whites around K18.]
;W[fd];B[ge];W[ee]
(;B[ef]C[impossible

MM:  Maybe the other side works better.];W[ed];B[eg];W[df];B[kg]
C[MM:  Good, that's very big now.];W[mn];B[lo];W[on];B[ql];W[pl]

(;B[pk]C[MM:  Maybe I'm missing something, but it looks like the atari at P8 works better.  If you keep your groups connected, you will not have to scramble for two eyes in 5 or 6 moves.]
;W[ol];B[rm]C[MM:  You already know you cannot capture, so you are just reducing White's score by a point or two.  That's fine, but if you play S8 instead, then you get to keep sente.  Or else you get to capture two stones.  (I would play O5.)]
;W[rn];B[rl];W[no];B[nr]C[in the nick of time :-)

MM:  Connecting with P8 would have been better.];W[ms]C[MM:  Pointless.]

;B[fn];W[dn];B[em];W[ap];B[bq];W[qs];B[sh]C[MM:  T13 is a couple points better.]
;W[sg];B[oa];W[pa];B[la]C[MM:  Similar to the moves on the right, L19 is a couple of points better for Black.]
;W[ci];B[ka];W[hb];B[ja];W[ia];B[sm]C[Well thats about it.]
;W[sn];B[mi];W[gr];B[gs];W[ek];B[fl];W[pp];B[qp];W[op]C[MM:  Look how White keeps nickel-and-diming your score lower, in sente.  Connecting at P8 would have been better.]

;B[gi];W[gf];B[ie];W[fj];B[eo];W[do];B[ep]TR[jo]C[MM:  About now, you should play K5.  If White gets K6, that's two points for White.  If Black gets K5, White K4, Black K6, then Black took those two points away from White, in gote.  Removing two White points in gote with K5 is better than saving one Black point in gote with E4.]

MM:  It looks like it was a fun game; reviewing it was fun for me.  Thanks for the opportunity.
   I have a few suggestions:
   Gain a better sense for the big points.  Remember to look at the whole board, and ask yourself what area is the biggest.  "Play away from strength" as the proverb says.
   When you want to peep, force yourself to pause and try to read what will happen.  Often, forcing the opponent to connect, is not what you want to do.
   Like me, you seem accustomed to enjoying success in your killing attacks.  Like me, you will have to learn that the urge to kill is an obstacle to improving.  It's better to surround first, building outside strength that will translate into territory elsewhere.  (After that, if you see a way to kill, go for it; or you may attack the surrounded group as threats in a ko fight.)
   Try not to chase a group you cannot kill, through the area where you could make big territory (if you surround instead of trying to kill).
   Work on keeping sente.  Close games are won by keeping sente in the endgame.  (This was not very close, but it's always good to practice).  Keeping sente in the midgame is also crucial.
   Finally, remember that it's better to connect two of your groups than to be forced to make two eyes.
   Well, that's about it.  If you have any questions, please write.
