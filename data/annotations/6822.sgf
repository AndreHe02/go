C[so the match was between
braze [?\] - BLACK
Kelwynn [18k?\] - WHITE

I was the white and I got completely destroyed.  black was looking for someone between 15k-20k, he was unranked.

Paul: I suspect black is stronger than 15k.  I couldn't really say for sure, but I suspect he is.  He rarely misses a beat, although he does make a few critical mistakes... so who knows.]
;B[pd];W[dc]C[I know a lot of players play right on the dot D16 but I always play one below it, this shouldn't be a problem right?

Paul: There's nothing wrong with this move.  Although, personally I'd put it around d3 or c4.  If black chooses to play d4 or c3, you have one of those strange diagonal fighting games.

Supposedly, before they introduced komi some thousand years ago, nobody ever played on the hoshi (4-4) during fuseki (the opening).  They always played komoku (3-4).  In even games, komoku is just as good as the star point, but they do different things.  The 4-4 point doesn't secure any territory, it's only purpose is influence.  The 3-3 point is the other extreme -- it instantly seals the corner, but has no influence and the 3-4 point is half of each.]
;B[dp];W[qp]C[I thought it was kind of weird that black played in the top right and bottom left, isn't it normal to play either both stones on the right or both of them on the left?

Paul: As I mentioned back at move 2, the diagonal game is all fighting.  Some people really like fighting games and they go for the opposite corner game.  In a game like this it's difficult to make a moyo and you usually have to fight for everything.]
;B[op];W[mq]TR[pm][pn]SQ[mp]C[I actually don't really know why I did this move, it's just that I've heard it's the best possible move to do when you're attacked

like I played S4, black attacks P4, so I would counter with N3 right?

Paul: I'm not sure there's any one best move for any single corner position.  It really depends on what's near by and what your goals are.  Certainly N3 is playable (N4 may be also), but so might Q6 or Q7.  Any way you work it out, you're going to be fighting because of the influence from D4 and Q16.

If you had a white stone at Q13, I'd say Q6 or A7 are far better than N3.  Because you don't want black to form a moyo that's bigger than any moyo you can make, it really might be best to pincer the *approaching* move of P4.  In my opinion, it really can't be said to be an *attack* here, it's just an approach.  The reason I feel it's not an attack is that I don't think black can reasonably expect to *kill* the R4 stone even if you tenuki after the approach -- although he could possibly force you to live very small in the corner if you don't respond.]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[mo]
(;W[jp]C[I was trying to take the bottom middle part of the map

Was K4 the wrong move? should I have gone instead to M5?

Paul: Well, that bottom middle part is hard to get, at least in a way that gives you lots of points. The reason is because of the influence from D4, which you see on move 11.  Personally, I think I would have gone for L3 so I could either follow up L6 or with an approach of my own at F3.  (See the variations.)

Although, no matter how it turns out in the middle there, you're still weakening the R4 stone because you're allowing black to build thickness on top of it.  It may become quite hard to live in that corner or even flee later.  Fleeing will inevitably run into that Q16 stone or extensions from it.]
;B[gq];W[cq]C[I think  that whenever a player plays on the star D4 that the best way to attack is to play C3, is this correct?

Paul: Again, it always depends what's around.  It's true that a 3-3 invasion can always live under a 4-4 stone (with few black stones nearby anyway); but it's rarely a good idea.  It nearly always leads to a silly 8 point corner while black gets so much outside thickness that it's not an even trade.  We can see here that black is intentionally violent, hence their diagonal game, no sense giving them all that thickness to use attacking you all over the board.

Of course, *using* thickness is a hard thing to do well, but it's definitely not a fair trade.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[dr]C[I was going for the bottom of the board so I played D2, I probally should have gone B5 correct?

Paul: I'm not enitrely sure on the ordering of this Joseki.  I think d2 is ok.  I know black makes an error later, but I'm not sure how to punish it.  It seems you make a bigger error anyway.]
;B[er]
(;W[bo]C[(Paul: see variation.)];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm]C[(Paul: pretty sure this is an overplay... I believe, since black has so many cutting points, you can play on top.)]

(;W[am]C[This move now that I think about it probally was a mistake, I should have gone B4 instead of A7 right?

Paul: No, think bigger.  See the variation.  When people deviate from joseki, there's usually some cool things you can do to punish them.  It's a bad idea to memorize joseki, but I think it's pretty clear here why black is supposed to push at c7.]
;B[al]
(;W[an];B[bp]C[This move pretty much killed all my stones bottom left, now that I've seen it I'll try not to make the same mistake

Paul: Definitely watch out for shapes with only two liberties left.  But connecting was the real mistake.  I think you had other optoins -- see vairations.]

(;W[bl]C[Paul: when you realize your stones are dead... unless you can immediately find some beinifit from playing nearby, don't touch them.  They're worth a lot as Aji.  You can use them later during a ko fight or to build something else that hasn't even developed yet.  If you force your opponent to capture them, then you effectively cannot use them for *anything* useful.  Save them for later.  Save them.  

Although, here, I think you can immediately use them to live in the corner.  Oh, it appears no.  This corner is hopeless.  It's better to leave this stuff behind in case it comes in helpful later on.  See if you can build something bigger instead.  There's a 10 point move at C15, you could try to link your lower right corner together with your middle stones at P3 (huge fight) or Q2 (might work, dunno), but there's little to gain from B8.]
;B[ao];W[ak];B[am];W[bk];B[jr]C[Paul: The B9 group isn't worth much, but now the M4 group has lost it's only possible eye -- it helps to have an eye when you're running -- and there's less chance of connecting under the black stones.]
;W[kr]C[Paul: probably L2 would be better at M3, L3, or L6 (running).  Touching (tsuke) the enemy generally means you have to give something up, since you start the capture race at a disadvantage.]
;B[kq];W[lq]C[I was wondering whether to play M3 or K3, since I thought he was going to cut my formation apart I decided to go M3 and I think maybe it was a mistake]
;B[lr]TR[cn][co][dp][dq][er]C[not really sure how to avoid this move because he would have cut me at M3 anyways if I didn't play there.

Paul: Again, I think the mistake was playing on the left (making the B9 group) when you had a chance to try to do something with these stones before.  They weren't set up to withstand attack and you helped black build the thickness (triangles) pointed at your formation.  The attack was the next logical step for black because of it.]
;W[mr];B[ks];W[qc]C[Paul: This is probably the single worst way to deal with the Q16 stone.  It already has a lot of influence.  You're only likely to give it more by living small underneath it.]

(;B[pr]C[not sure why my opponent ignored my attack R17, maybe I shouldn't have played there?

Paul: It really isn't an attack.  There's no way to kill the black stone and it's effects (influence) are still intact.  Personally, I think the black move at Q2 would work better at Q6.  Allowing you to live small in the corner while getting outside thickness could be a huge advantage for black.  See variation.]
;W[lo];B[ln];W[kn];B[km];W[mn]C[should I have gone L5 instead of N6?

Paul: possibly.  Then you might be able to flee more effectively.  The situation for whie here is grim no matter how you work it out.  But it's clear white can only run away.  There's no eyes to be made here.]
;B[lm];W[jn];B[im];W[jm];B[jl];W[mm];B[lk];W[in];B[hm]C[Paul: Still no weyes, and you need two of them.  I think black has the idea right: use thickness to murder enemy.]
;W[kp];B[ho];W[or];B[oq];W[os];B[qq]C[Paul: I believe this is a mistake.  See variation.]

(;W[pp];B[pq];W[oo];B[no];W[nn];B[np];W[pn];B[rp];W[qo]C[Paul: This move is a little slow.  So was Q6.  I think O3 still helps you live in the middle -- could be wrong.  But R5 is a little slow.]
;B[ps];W[nr];B[rr]C[Paul: This was a mistake for black.  He could have killed you at N1.  O3 was the move (if there was one).]
;W[ms];B[jo];W[io];B[ip];W[ko]C[I managed to make my stones at the bottom of the board survive, but I still have no idea how he managed to surround me like that, was there any way for me to have fought back?

Paul: Yes.  But I think I covered it before.  It was much earlier.]
;B[hn];W[bq]C[I thought I could make bottom left live but it didn't work out in the end.

Paul: Yeah, I looked at this earlier in the review.  I don't think there's enough room to live.  Even when you had the Aji of the B6 group, it was still too tight, but it's probably impossible now.]
;B[cr];W[ds];B[br];W[pj]C[was this too greedy of me? should I have played Q8 instead of Q10?

Paul: No, Q10 is way too slow.  In fact, I think your Q8 move should have been even further out ... even greedier.  Perhaps R14 (threating to use your R16 stone) or Q14.  He can still maybe slide under your wall-like-formation, but you might just build some thickness during the conflict.]
;B[pl]
(;W[ml];B[mk];W[ll];B[kl];W[ro];B[sp];W[so];B[om]C[this move killed all my stones right? I probally should have played there before trying to take more territory with Q10

Paul: well, the peep may kill some of them.  It might be better to give up the O6 stones and try to keep the R5 stones.  I think the mistake was at N8 or there abouts...  I don't think that move helped.  See the variation at move 84.]
;W[on];B[qm]C[again, he killed the chance to make the 2 eyes, I prob should have played this spot sooner.]
;W[rm]C[I was trying to at least claim the right side of the board but he managed to stop m again somehow...]
;B[qn]
(;W[rn]C[Paul: This was a little slow.  It's probably better to try to run as fast as you can that try to stay connected when you're getting surrounded.  Even if you lose a few stones, you might gain something.  Although, I think here black has spread himself a little to thinly in his violent attempts to kill you -- I believe it should have backfired.]
;B[rl];W[ol]C[I was trying to get rid of the black stones and maybe survive on the right side.]
;B[nl];W[ok];B[pm];W[nk];B[nm];W[qd]C[I couldn't think of any way to make my stones live so I was going to at least try for upper right corner.]
;B[pc];W[pk]C[I was hoping he wouldn't notice that I could capture him since he was paying attention top right but that didn't work out too well.

Paul: Bad.  Aji Keshi.  After a while, it becomes very unsatisfying to win on lucky moves like this even when they work (which they will from time to time).  Personally, I'd rather not win than get lucky on "hope they won't notice" moves.  I usually say: dude, you're in atari if they don't notice on a move like this.  You'll see what I mean after a few more games.  Poker is a game of chance. Go is not.]
;B[po];W[qf];B[ri]CR[qc][qd][qf]TR[rm][rn][qo][ro][so][pp][qp]
SQ[pj][nk][ok][pk][ol]C[this move killed my cluster again didn't it?

Paul: Do you mean the R5 stones (triangles)?  Those are dead either way.  I believe this black move is a "splitting attack"  Arguably a poor one (maybe R12 is better?), but it does seem to try to disconnect the P9 stones (squares) from connecting to the R14 stones (circles).]
;W[qk];B[rk]
(;W[jd]C[Paul: This move is huge.  It may neutralize the Q17 stones, tries to build some territory and tries to use the (feeble though it may be) thickness from the B9 stones.  Another fine move here is Q15.  Always "hane at the head of two".]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[le];W[kf];B[de];W[cg]C[I probally should have gone F16 instead of C13 right? I wanted to try and make my stones on the left side live.

Paul: This seems reasonable to me.  Either black will try to take the left side or the top.  Which side seems bigger?  Possibly the L14 stone could have gone to C15 to "seal the corner" and prevent this approach in the first place.  L14 doesn't presently seem as useful as C15 would have been.]
;B[cc];W[cd]C[should I have gone C18 instead of C16?

Paul: 6 of one, half dozen of the other.  I feel like C18 might be too slow and C16 is better, but there's really no perfect solution here.  Black is probably going to get something no matter what.]

;B[bb];W[fc];B[ca]
(;W[bd]C[Paul: this probably doesn't help enough... and the empty triangle is notoriously bad.]
;B[ch]TR[lk][mk][jl][kl][hm][im][hn][ho]C[I should have been able to kill black's stone at C12 but for some reason it lived.

Paul: This game is rarely about killing.  It's actually quite difficult to kill things.  It's better to threaten to kill things and make territory.  Let your opponents kill things while you make huge moyos and claim huge territory...

That said, although black is starting this fight at a disadvantage (tsuke nearly always does start at a disadvantage); I suspect it's impossible to kill black.  First, you may kill this one stone, but black will almost certainly get something while you kill it and he can easily run to his thickness in the middle (triangles).  This one stone doesn't even have to live if he can make sabaki (light skillful play), he'll still ruin your B9 stones.  They're too low and far away to connect properly with this stone in the way.]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[cj];B[di];W[dg];B[dj]C[It's like whenever black plays a stone, I can't ever kill it, he always escapes and cuts my stones apart.

Paul: It's because of his influence.  If all those black stones across the way were white, I think you'd have a lot better chance.  For one thing, you could run to them instead of him and his stones would have nothing to connect to.  See variation.]

(;W[bi];B[bh];W[ah];B[bg];W[bf];B[ag]C[I tried to stop him but he cut right in the middle of my stones so both sides ended up dying.]

[he][ie][je][ef][hf][jf][jg]C[okay so I tried to learn from earlier and play my stones so that I can form the 2 eyes and live but did I put it in the wrong spot? should it have been F12 instead of F11?

Paul: If anything, your mistakes in this fight are playing too closely.  Learn to attack from a distance.  If you review this fight, I think the black stones (triangles) should have died a few moves back.  I suspect by touching him so often you gave him cutting points to use to escape.  Certainly some of the forcing moves were necessary, but if you'd have attacked from a stone or two away here and there, I think you could have surrounded him.  His ultimate goal is, of course, to flee to that thickness in the middle.  We saw that a variation ago.]

;W[jh];B[kg];W[lf];B[kh]C[black just easily surrounds me while I was trying to kill his stones, I just don't get it.

Paul: It's a combination of his thickness and his ability to use your cutting points against you.  I definitely think black is stronger than 15k ... I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it.  Soon, you'll do these things to people.]
;W[af]C[I thought that maybe I still had a chance to live if I could link both groups and make 2 eyes

Paul: It's going to be awfuly hard to make two eyes in there.  I don't think I could do it.  There's a lot going on in there.  It may be possible, but I suspect not.  There just isn't enough room.]
;B[df]C[this move stopped me from making the eyes right?

Paul: No, I think even if you'd have gotten to play there, it would have been a false eye, so you'd still be short an eye.]
;W[cf];B[ek];W[ij]TR[lk][mk][jl][kl][hm][im][hn][ho]C[probally not a great idea to try and escape, I was alreayd dead right?  

Paul: Yes, because of the influence from the triangles.  You have nowhere to run.  Plus, he can cut you at F13 and then the running is pointless.]

[qp]C[probally a pointless move right? I was trying to maye surround the 2 black stones at S8 and S9 so maybe I could live on right side.

Paul: right idea, but probably a little late.  So yes, pointless.  Perhaps you were hoping the triangles weren't dead? I think if black plays T7, they only have one liberty...  It might be possible to get two eyes by exploiting that though (variation) if and only if it were white's turn here.]

(;B[rj];W[rf];B[sh]C[once again black manages to escape death by linking and killing my stones clusters.]
;W[sf];B[sd]C[was this a pointless move on black's part?

Paul: Not really.  Certainly, there's no way to kill white's bulky 10 shape here, but he's hoping you can't read it out.]
;W[pa];B[sb]C[another pointless move on black's part? what was he trying to do? I asked him at the end of the game but he didn't say anything.

Paul: He's hoping he can build a dead shape in here because he suspects you're a less experienced player.  One you let him have two moves, I believe he had a chance.  But he needs to make sure you can't escape first.]
