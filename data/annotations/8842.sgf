C[lkitrossky [20k\]: Hello!];B[dp];W[pp];B[dd];W[pd];B[dj];W[pj]
;B[jd];W[md];B[mc];W[mb]C[thesarge: I would probably play this at O17 or something like that]
;B[lc];W[nc];B[lb];W[na];B[la];W[ld]C[thesarge: The board is wide open - play a big move somewhere! If you want to build up more strength here, I would at least play a more open move like N14]
;B[kd];W[lh]C[thesarge: better];B[kh];W[kg];B[jg];W[jh];B[ki]
;W[ji];B[li];W[mh];B[lg];W[kf];B[lf];W[jf];B[ig];W[le];B[ke]
;W[mf];B[jj];W[hh];B[ih];W[ii];B[if];W[mg];B[ij];W[hi];B[hg]
;W[hj];B[hk];W[kj];B[lj];W[kk];B[jl]C[thesarge: See how black uses jumps like the move to K8 where you are mostly connecting your stones? It lets him continually get the edge and block you in]
;W[lk];B[mj];W[nj]C[thesarge: I would probably play this closer to N9, dont let him escape downward and cut off your stones.]
;B[mk]C[thesarge: this pattern happens a few times this game - you start to build a ladder which would normally work out for you except for the fact that there is no stone at N11. Without it the ladder is doomed and you are only making a weak formation with lots of points for him to attack]
;W[ml];B[nk];W[ok]C[thesarge: I would probably try and get life for the M9 group of stones instead of continuing the ladder here. maybe at M7 or N7.]
;B[nl];W[nm];B[ol];W[pl];B[om];W[on];B[mm];W[ll];B[nn];W[mi]
;B[lm];W[pm];B[nm];W[ik]C[thesarge: The M9 group is already dead, I wouldn't give him more opportunities to build up there trying to save it]
;B[jk];W[il];B[hl];W[im];B[hn]C[thesarge: Again his one space jump allows him to cut you off]
;W[jm];B[kl];W[hm];B[gm];W[gl];B[gk]C[thesarge: See how the only real effect here was to make life even harder for your group at H12?]
;W[fl];B[gj];W[fi];B[gi];W[gh];B[qc];W[pb];B[qd];W[qe];B[re]
;W[qf];B[rf];W[rg];B[sf];W[sg];B[rd];W[sd]C[thesarge: Nice, I can see you thinking about eye structure here]
;B[qb];W[rb];B[pa];W[oa];B[qa];W[rc];B[gg];W[fh]C[thesarge: This also worked out well, but imagine what happens if he plays at F12 instead of G13]
;B[fj];W[ej];B[el];W[fk];B[fm];W[em];B[dm];W[en];B[fn];W[fo]
;B[gn];W[dn];B[dl];W[ho];B[in];W[io];B[jn];W[kn];B[jo];W[jp]
;B[ko];W[lo]C[thesarge: Here is another not quite ladder];B[kp]
;W[kq];B[lp];W[mp];B[ln];W[km];B[mo];W[lq];B[mq];W[np];B[ip]
;W[jq];B[go];W[gp];B[hp];W[ep];B[gq];W[fp];B[eq];W[eo];B[cn]
;W[nq];B[do];W[mr];B[fq];W[fg];B[ff];W[eg];B[df];W[ef];B[ee]
;W[fe];B[gf];W[ge];B[ie];W[ed];B[de];W[kc];B[kb];W[jc];B[ic]
;W[jb];B[ja];W[ma];B[ib]C[thesarge: There is now a weakness at P18, that area needs to be defended]
;W[he];B[pc];W[ob];B[oc];W[nd];B[nb];W[sc];B[dg];W[dh];B[ch]
;W[di];B[ci];W[dk];B[cj];W[ir];B[ek];W[ck];B[bk];W[cl];B[bl]
;W[hr];B[gr];W[gs];B[fs];W[hs];B[qp];W[pn];B[qo];W[qn];B[rn]
;W[rm];B[pq];W[ro];B[rp];W[sn];B[rq];W[oq];B[pr];W[os];B[ps]
;W[or];B[qr];W[rs];B[rr];W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[od];W[pe];B[oe]
;W[of];B[ne];W[nf];B[me];W[lf];B[qg];W[qh];B[pf];W[pg];B[qf]
;W[oh];B[rh]C[thesarge: Overall, the main thing you need to work on is playing much more loosely. 99% of your moves are touching another one of your stones. This allows you to be clumped up and killed easier, and makes your moves less efficient. In addition, don't try and cut every connection you see. Try to read a few moves ahead to see what the outcome might be and go for the ones that give you an advantage.]
