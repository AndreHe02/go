C[Dear GTL reviewer

I'm dk in this game, White, this is a game I won.

I had a lot of opportunities to attack weak black groups, I think I dit not managed it so well.     My concerns are :

fuseki, direction of play,
attacking, more precisely :
in which cases is it interesting to deprive a group of his eyes and hunt ?   in which cases is it interesting to seal a group, let him live, and build influence ?

(I have a lot of difficulties to understand this),
and any other big mistakes you can notice.

Thanks a lot

C[This move seems at little too lose q14 or r14 seems better.]
;B[oc]C[This is not good for black. Black should play o16 or p15.]

C[J16 is the urgent point.];W[id]C[Very good !!];B[hc];W[kb]
;B[cc]C[This looks like an overplay. The black f17 group is too weak.]
;W[cd]C[White should play e18 letting black live small in the corner and attacking the outside group. White c16 let black stabilize the position with e18.]
;B[bc]C[White gets a second chance.];W[eb]C[Good better late than never :-)]
;B[bd];W[be];B[dc];W[ed];B[db]C[This shape is dead look at the variations.]

(;W[fe]C[A general rule is dont touch what you attack.
In this case f14 would be a stronger attack on the outside group, because it is more difficult for black to get good shape by leaning on white.]

;B[fb];W[ea];B[ba]C[Now comes the question should white play from the outside or the inside ?

If white plays from the inside at J18 he will get points at the top, but black can still get out because white has bad shape.   When white plays l14 he fixes his outside shape, and black is still not unconditionally alive. (see var.)]

(;W[fa]C[It is to early to remove blacks eyes because he still can escape. Anyway F19 is small J18 is much better.]
