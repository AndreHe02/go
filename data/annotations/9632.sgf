C[Comments by black:

I really enjoyed playing this game, as it is the first after rethinking how to approach the game.  I decided, once again, to play honte rather than greed.  I know some of my moves are slow, and my opponent missed some opportunities to win, but I'd like to know a stronger players thoughts.  My main concern is whole board vision, not little skirmishes.  But correct shape moves along the side or in fights are definitely appreciated.  I like notes for subtle move changes, like big knight or small for corner enclosure?  One question, what is the best variation for both sides when I approach bottom left corner?  Should I approach differently?  Double approach? Approach other side?  Not approach at all?  Please take into account the whole board, and put lots of thought into the move, as I will be judging future games according to your response.  I felt like I played great, but prove to me how wrong I am.  Show all my mistakes.  I hope I will be satisfied with my first review here!

~~~~~~~~

Alex: I'm not strong enough to find *all* your mistakes, but I hope I can give you some useful suggestions!  My first reaction to your comments is that you can't separate whole board vision from "little skirmishes": it's impossible to understand one without the other.  But let's go through the game and see what we can find...

(One hour later)

After reading through the game, it's not about "little" skirmishes, it's about massive skirmishes!  There were lots of weak groups for both sides, and finding the right move to cut, connect, or win a capturing race makes a huge difference in this type of game.  Keep working on your tactics.  The stronger you get at those skirmishes, the more meaning you'll find in choices such as big vs small corner enclosure.  Think about attacking from a distance instead of pushing right up against your opponent's stones.]

(;B[nc]C[Is this fine?

Alex: Yes, it's fine.  Instead, the first move that comes to my mind is C14 (see variation).  But the difference is just a matter of style, as far as I can tell.  Your choice will lead to a more complicated game.]

(;W[cg]C[Guessing white should kick first...

Alex: Right, white E17 instead would be better.]
(;B[db]TR[id]C[Possible?  Or white seals in sente then approaches bottom right?  Should I leave this stone alone for now?

Alex: This is a little heavy: you're committing to keeping these two stones alive, but white J16 puts pressure on your position.  Instead, I'd play D17 or D16 instead, with the option of sacrificing a stone.]
;W[cc];B[fe]
(;W[ld]C[Floating, even more floating.

Alex: Don't get overconfident here!  Black and white have a weak group each.  True, white could have attacked more strongly with G16--see variation.  But you'll need another move to settle your stones, and then white gets to the big space on the right hand side first.]
;B[ib]C[This move gives a great feeling.  Take base, and make base.]
;W[qo];B[qm]C[I do this pincer because I want sente, but mostly because I am really comfortable with it.]
;W[pj]C[Radical

Alex: Agreed.  I don't understand this move.];B[po]C[Alex: Good move.]
;W[qp];B[pp];W[qn];B[pn];W[rm];B[ql];W[rl];B[qk];W[rr]
(;B[rk]TR[pj][ld]C[So much thickness, even though it is gote.  Is the bend small right now?

Alex: It's big, but I think that extending on the bottom is even bigger: see variation..  The problem with the bend is that white's floating (!) stones make it hard for you to build a big moyo.]

(;W[pg]C[More floats.

Alex: Yes, a white move at the bottom is better.];B[me]C[Alex: This is a nice double attack--but you need to follow up a bit more carefully.  Have you heard of "leaning attacks"?  The idea is to threaten one group to make your position stronger and attack another group.  If white defends one side, then you turn around and attack the other side.]
;W[kf];B[le];W[ke];B[lc];W[kc];B[md]
(;W[kd]C[Take a way base and split, though white has G16 then H18 to look foward to, so I really want to play J17.  Thoughts?

Alex: Your last few moves have made white stronger but haven't really helped black at all.  Instead, you could have been attacking the other floating stones: see the variation.]
;B[fq]C[This is my main concern.  Is this the best move possible?  Or rather move with best follow-ups.]

(;W[iq]C[Really bad, 3 weak groups.

Alex: I hope you said this to yourself after the game, and not during!  While you're playing, if you tell yourself that the opponent is weak then you're more likely to make silly mistakes.]
;B[fo]
(;W[cn]
(;B[dr]C[Alex: Same shape as at the top!  Keep this move in reserve, as you might want to play D3 or C3 instead.]
;W[cq]
(;B[kq]C[Is the cap at J5 better?

Alex: No, I think this is the best way.];W[mq]C[More weak groups.

Alex: Agree, N3 looks unreasonable.];B[qq]C[Is this too slow?

Alex: It's unnecessary.  Concentrate on attacking white's weak groups.  Later, in the endgame, you can think about whether R3 or R2 is better.  But right now, it contributes nothing to your attack, so there's no reason to play it.]

(;W[rq]
(;B[jp]C[Alex: Instead of this move, I'd prefer L5, putting pressure on both white stones equally.]
;W[ho]
(;B[ip]TR[le]C[Alex: This is a mistake, similar to M15 earlier.  You're helping white to settle the shape.  Instead, it's usually better to attack from a distance.]
;W[hp]C[Best move here for black?

Alex: Hard to say.  Normally you wouldn't push unless you were going to cut.  But you've already added a variation to show that the cut doesn't work.

Now that the three black stones are a little heavier, I think it's urgent ot defend them, so I'd probably play K6.]

(;B[gr];W[hr];B[gq];W[hq];B[jn];W[gn];B[en];W[mo]C[Too greedy...

Alex: Actually, it doesn't look bad.  The black stones on either side don't yet have eye shape.  Black could easily end up with three weak groups!

Yes, I think black still has an advantage here, but it's a complicated position and you still need to play carefully to bring home the win.]

(;B[do]C[Alex: Again, this does nothing to strengthen black's shape.  See the variation.]
;W[co];B[ln]C[Alex: Good, this is the rigth direction.];W[nm]

(;B[om]C[Alex: Again you're pushing against the opponent's weak stones when it's more effective to attack from a distance.  Here, P6 is better shape.]
;W[mn]
(;B[nl]C[Alex: Instead, try P9 as a leaning attack.];W[ml];B[nk]
;W[qh];B[lm];W[mm];B[kk]C[Alex: Good move.];W[mk];B[mj];W[lr]
;B[kr]C[Best move?

Alex: Yes.];W[or];B[qr]C[Best move?

Alex: It looks ugly, but actually I think it's just as good as any other move in that area.]
;W[nj]
(;B[oj]C[Alex: What if black plays the other side?  Actually, the capturing race is too complicated for me to read out, but I think it's in white's favour.  See the variation for one example of what might happen.]
;W[lj];B[ni];W[lk]
(;B[jj]C[Is this a good move?  I naturally like it, is that bad?

Alex: The shape feels a little clumsy--I'd prefer J9--but the direction is good.  You can probably kill at least one white group, so if you can keep all your groups alive then you've won the game.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qe];B[pe];W[pf]
(;B[pd]C[Alex: There's no need to defend here.  See the variation.]
;W[lh];B[mh];W[kj]C[This only helps me, but does end in sente for white.

Alex: Are you sure it's sente?  As a general principle, if a group is struggling to live, it should nearly always end in gote.  See variation to move 95.]

(;W[dk]TR[dr][fq][gq][gr][do][en][fo][gn][ho][hp][hq][hr][iq]
[kr][kq][jp][ip][jn][ln][lm][kk][jk][jj]C[Wrong direction?

Alex: Yes.  There are still three groups at the bottom that aren't fully alive,  Your suggested variation is much better.]

(;B[de]C[Too slow?

Alex: Yes.  If white's last move was the wrong direction, then this is just as wrong!  See variations.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[cf]
(;B[gm]C[Does this move work?  I looked at it for a while before playing.

Alex: I don't know!  This is very complicated.  My instinct is that attacking from a distance is more likely to work.]

(;W[hm];B[fm];W[hl]
(;B[gk]C[Alex: I think F9 is better.];W[gl];B[fl];W[hk]
(;B[kh]C[Is this okay timing?

Alex: I think the timing is OK, but K12 is a better move for keeping white separated *and* keeping the black stones connected.]

;W[ik];B[ii];W[ji];B[ki];W[jh];B[jg];W[ih];B[hh]C[What is funny, is I didn't know at the time that whites stones were in a ladder.  I was about to atari them to J14.]
;W[kl];B[ig];W[jl];B[ji];W[ll]C[The game ends here: black won on time.]
;B[li]TR[kr][kq][ip][jp][jn][ln][lm][lh][lg][kf][ke][kd][kc]
[ld][id]C[Still a game right? If white makes right group live, then the game is determined by how well I do on the left?

Alex: Assuming that white lives on the right, and the marked stones (white at the top and black at the bottom) are all dead, I estimate that black is a little ahead, maybe ten points.  Black has around 80 points at the top, and not much else.  White has around 40 at the left, 35 at the bottom, and 10 with the two right side groups.  But black should be able to take sente and get to D11 first., which tips the balance.  So yes, it's "still a game": depending on how the endgame turns out, either player could win.]

Now you'd like to play next at B6.  But if you've previously exchanged D5 for C5, then B6 doesn't work.

In general, if you settle the shape too early, it's likely to cost you points in the endgame.  Moves like D5, J4, D2, D18, M15 can be good if there's a clear plan behind them.  But if you just play such moves for the enjoyable feeling of pushing the opponent around, then it costs you.]
