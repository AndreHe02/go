C[seems like w is asking for trouble.....w has no friends in the area and his closest strong groups are all on 3rd line.]
;B[ch]C[this move is too defensive...in a sense, you gave w a sente reduction...it is true that w would like to aim at c12, but you probably will have to be more aggressive to take advantage of the game.]
;W[dm]
(;B[bj]LB[fm:A]C[very slow.  your last move was not very aggressive (it was very defensive).  To play two defensive moves in a row is horrible.  I think a play at 'A' is far more aprropriate]

SQ[ko][ip][hq]C[let's pretend w gets a wall at the circles and b gets a wall at the squares....w's territory is clearly much more solid and w can easily strengthen his weak group AND reduce b's territory at the same time...so this is bad timing/placement for a reduction.  probably better to build up even more strength and try a more severe invasion rather than reduction in this area since w is harder to attack.]

;B[rp];W[nn];B[mo];W[pn]
(;B[qq];W[qm];B[nr];W[qo];B[or];W[rn]C[OUCH!
b may look ok...but now w is slightly ahead in points after komi and has lots of prospects (o17/r14 looking like nice approach moves for w)....the only advantage b has on the board is still slightly weak d10 group...b needs to find a way to take advantage of this flaw or might as well resign.  attacking this group can be hard though, as their is no immediate area that black can turn into profit nearby.]

(;B[nc]C[b recognized that o17/r14 are excellent points for w...so he tried to take them first.  In this case, I might be tempted to try to make up some ground more quickly and form larger double-wing corner and put some minor pressure on j17 group with L17]
;W[qd];B[pe]LB[qc:A][qe:B]C[this next move is a very painful move for b...if b takes A...w becomes stronger at right and q10 stone beocmes even weaker...if B, then w eats up entire B corner and b's right site looks like it can be more easily reduced...this move in game, threatens to build center influence at the expensive of w taking points on right side...though the reason why is not entirely clear.  perhaps to support a grand attack against d10 group?  let's hope so.]

;B[qb];W[lb]C[a big point, for sure, but perhaps better at m17( playing m18 allows b to possibly make some points facing q15 wall)]
;B[kc];W[kb];B[jc];W[jb];B[id];W[hc];B[md];W[lh]C[OK...b saw that m18 was low is attempting to take advantage of it.  w over-extends into b's area from a weakish group.  this is the moment to take control of the game until the end!]

NickSib:  This seems like most obvious move...but you might be willing to try j11 as well.]
;W[lj];B[ki]C[this peep is probably premature...not because w might not respond...but because you may end up wanting to peep at n11 to take profit/make eyeshape later on in game OR w might find a better move than m11 to fix shape.]
;W[nj];B[jk];W[nh];B[qi]C[this is not as urgent as you may think.  probably better to now attack left-center weak group with e9.]

great result for w....now k11 is looking a little weak (its not REALLY weak yet, but a little closer)...w has reduce all of b's potential, secured eyeshape, and given d10 group another place to run if it gets into trouble.  definitely a bad result for b

Result: W+0.5

B had many missed opportunities to take advantage of weak groups and didn't.  Remember, there is a go proverb that says, "each weak group of yours is worth 30 points of territory for your opponent."  often, the entire course of a game is decided by how a weak group gets attacked.  In this game, there were never any severe attacks, just puny/greedy territorial moves.  W basically won because b was never able to take advantage of weaknesses or attack w's isolated stones.]
