RE[W+50.50]

AB[pp][dp][pd][dd]C[I always have trouble with the opening and the bigs plays. They seem to be my weakness in most games could someone please reveiw this game and tell me what I am doing wrong?

EmTom: Hi I will review this game. I think that you made few basic mistakes and tactical errors. I will try to explain basic concepts rather than complicated variations. I hope that this is going to be useful. Enjoy the review.]
;W[nq];B[pr]LB[or:E][np:C][qn:A][pn:B][qm:D]C[ET: This move is a bit weird. Normally you play one of marked spots. You took teritory in the corner though so its not bad... 

I would recommend A or B. C is useful if you want to make a big moyo on the right side (stone around q10 would help). 

D is a bit loose so it can cause some trouble later if white invades. E is similar idea to what you did. Joseki dictionary describes it as "greedy play of using the star point immediately for territory".]
;W[fq];B[dn]C[ET: good move. This is a joseki.];W[dq]C[I am trying to defend the corner, could this have been done better?]
;B[cq];W[dr]C[Not too sure what to do here. I was attempting to defend the corner

ET: I think that its better to cover w and let him take small corner. White is getting a bit overconcentrated here. He should have played around k4 maybe. D2 instead of D3 would also be better for white.]

(;B[cp]C[ET: This move is not good. This cutting point is a little pain but it is definitely too slow to defend it now. You allowed white to make a nice shape and you didnt really defend the corner.]
;W[ep];B[eo];W[fo];B[fn];W[go];B[gn];W[hn];B[gm]TR[gn][fn]LB[hm:A]
[gl:B]C[ET: Terrible move. With marked stones it creates shape called "empty triangle" which is synonymous to "inefficient". You should avoid making this shape unless it is absolutely necessary. You should have played at A but if you are affraid that white will cut you B is much better than what you played.]
;W[hm];B[gl];W[ko];B[no]LB[pj:B][jd:A][fd:C]C[ET: Locally its a good move. But I would consider playing in empty space now. C is to make big moyo on the left side.]
;W[mo]
(;B[nm];W[qc]C[I never seem to be able to defend these kind of invasions, I just don't know what to do.

ET: You cant "defend" such invasion. White cannot be killed here. This is not a problem though. In this position you should say "thank you" and build a huge wall. Variation shows how you play after 3-3 invasion.]

(;B[jd]LB[id:A]C[I could I have prevented this cut?

ET: Yes earlier. Its too late now. You should have played this move at A.]
;W[ke];B[je];W[kf];B[lf]TR[oi][cg]C[ET: This move is not efficient enough. You should reinforce areas of your influence now i think. Marked spots seem quite interesting.]
;W[jf];B[if];W[jg];B[jb];W[kc];B[kb]C[ET: This is so small... this is endgame really. You should have played big moves like those i showed you earlier.]
;W[lb];B[ka]C[ET: Empty triangle again! And you lose sente because of it. Not good.]
;W[la];B[hb];W[ig];B[hf];W[hg];B[gf];W[jk]C[ET: This whites move is a mistake. He should have reduced your left side more.]
;B[gi];W[hj];B[gj];W[pj]
(;B[nj]C[I don't know how to attack q10

ET: Well i think you cant kill it. Theres a lot of space on the edge (cause your position is so high) and white can easly escape to the center if you block it on the edge. See varation.]
;W[pm];B[pl];W[ql];B[ol];W[rm];B[pk];W[qk]
(;B[oj]C[ET: Here you are pushing white to make more and more on this side. This is bad direction of play. You should attack it from the other side.]

;W[rf];B[se];W[sf];B[rc];W[qe];B[rb];W[qb];B[ra];W[qa]C[ET: You should switch to left side already and reinforce it. Notice that you have very high position there too so white will try to invade and live there.]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[nb];W[ob];B[na];W[ma];B[hh];W[ji];B[gg];W[di]
C[whenever someone plays into my territory like this I always end up loseing, what am I doing wrong?

ET: Ok this is a bit harder for white. Notice that this time white cannot escape to the center. You should go for a kill here. The first step is to take opponents base.]

(;B[ci]C[ET: This is the worst move possible. Theres a rule that says that you DO NOT touch a stone that you want to kill. The reason for this is that touching opponent stone starts a fight. Fight makes both stronger. You dont want to fight. You just want to kill. White has to fight to make life cause he is so weak. So when you touch this stone you actually help white.]
;W[cj]
(;B[bi];W[bj]
(;B[dj]C[ET: Cut. Same as with touching move. You dont want to create weak stones. You have to be solid.]
;W[dh]C[ET: See? Now you are in trouble :)]
(;B[ch]C[ET: Empty triangle nr three. You saw what happened later and this is all because of this move. The problem with it is that black has only three liberties now.]

(;B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]C[ET: This is one posibility. Black has a HUGE wall and white is closed in the corner. This result favours black greatly at this (early) stage of the game. 

3-3 invasions should be played later in the game when defending player does not have so many possibilities to use influence he gets.]
