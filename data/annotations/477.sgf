C[Thank you for selecting me to review this game.

I am happy2, 9k* on igs... also known as Brady in the real world.

Let me make the usual disclaimer...  I am not a dan, so I am entitled to be wrong, and frequently am  :-)

Also:  This game starts out as a moyo game...  I think it is very difficult for anyone say, 5k or worse, to be terribly effective with this style, so I usually emphasize territory in my games.  I will do my best to review from a moyo standpoint here though.

I learned after writing all my comments that white is 3 stones stronger than me!  Maybe I better edit this :-)

Finally, I am very sarcastic.  Some of my comments may seem overly negative.  They are not meant to be.  However, the fact is, kyu's make more bad than good moves.  The only way to get better is to point them out.  Please take my smiles :-)  and winks ;-) literally.

Be of good humor when you read this!  Don't be offended.];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]C[the 3 black stones on the starpoints make a sanren-sei.  a nice fast opening.]
;W[jd];B[jp];W[gp]C[an odd move.  I think D10 is correct.  This move does not claim territory, nor does it help the top. It invites black C10 or D10.   var 2: After D10 If white responds from the bottom, he makes bad shape around the 4-4 stone.    var 3: Ideally, one would like one close stone and one far stone to complete a 4-4 enclosure)]

(;B[cf]C[Oops.  I think black c10 or D10 is much better here.  Those positions cannot be effectively attacked.

If white pincers here, it is a double purpose move.  It attacks the single black stone, and acts as an ideal extension from the enclosure below.

Var 2:  pincer with black jumping to middle

var 3:  pincer with black jumping into corner.]
(;W[ce]C[Oops.  I was really hoping for a white pincer here  :-)

This move helps black live.

Here is a general rule to live by:  "Never attach to a weak stone."  Doing so just makes him stronger.]

(;B[cj]C[Not good right now.

Another guidleline.  When an opponent touches your single stone, either extend or hane.  don't tenuki.

var 2: proper play];W[cm]C[Remember what I said earlier about bad shape around the 4-4?  Here it is.  Again, white invites an invasion, right now!

(Or any time in the near future if you want to defend first)]
;B[df];W[fd]
(;B[jj]C[Ok.  At the beginning, I explained that I have difficulty appreciating the moyo game.  This could be brilliant.  But I think c3 or c17 would be much more interesting.    Var 2:  lets try c17 just for fun.]
;W[nc]C[A big move.  It is both an approach move on a corner and a nice extension along the top.]
;B[of]C[in his comments, phk expressed discomfort with this move.  Good.  Another rule to live by:  "3rd line is for territory, 4th line is for influence, 5th line is for pros."  In other words,  The 5th line is almost never right for kyu players.  I like Q14 here.  If white tenukies, then m17 or q18.

If you are trying to build your moyo, perhaps the attach and extend joseki (o16)will work. Although I don't like it because it attaches to a weak stone.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[pc];B[qb];W[od];B[pe];W[qa]C[way too early.  especially in a moyo game, black should tenuki]
;B[le]C[Ok.  Here we go again.  Maybe this is a good moyo developing move for black... but I hate it.  It just invites white to take 4th line territory, which is really big.

I think an invasion is better.  Either c17, k17, or m17.  (I am not sure about m17)


I'll tell you what... let's wait till the end of the game, and see how much territory black has in the center, and compare it with what white has at the top.]
;W[ld];B[ke];W[kd];B[gq]MA[np][pn]C[following are phk's comments:  " I felt it was too early to do any of K3, R3 or R10 yet.  This was probably more a spur of the moment play than a carefully thought out strategy... :)"

I agree that the moves he mentioned aren't ideal.. .

How about the marked locations?  These go a long way toward perfecting your moyo and giving you an easy game.    And of course, both c3 and c17 are still there for the taking.

This move helps white perfect his corner.  It would be far better to invade at c3 and destroy it.]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[pn]C[This is an odd move.

R6 is standard.  The reason q6 is questionable is because it has no good continuation to make a base on the right side.

In other words, all white can really do is run.  This lets black make profit while attacking/]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[ql];W[np]C[Too loose.  black should be able to separate the stones.  o6 is standard]
;B[oo];W[on];B[ro]C[I don't understand this move.  Why here?

Why not just push through at o5?];W[pk];B[qk];W[nn];B[no];W[mo]
;B[mp];W[lo];B[mq]C[ok.  black gained some nice profit while attacking.  that is a big corner!]
;W[km]C[This move is a little loose, I think.

M7 would give lovely shape.    White already has one near eye, and the ability to run in two directions.

Black's moyo is getting reduced];B[pl]C[I am not sure what black is trying here.  It almost turns out great, though.]
;W[ok];B[ol];W[nl];B[nk];W[oj];B[mk]TR[pk][ok][oj]C[This sets up a ladder on the 3 white marked stones.   White needs to help them]
;W[ml]C[Oops!  White defends his larger group instead.

Now, black p11 captures the stones, and gets a ton of territory!  (I think the game would almost be over)]
;B[lk]C[Oops. I wonder who takes p11 first.

By the way.  Maybe dans wouldn't capture at p11, prefering to play on a grand scale.

But for mid kyus and weaker, it is perfect!  Much territory, and easy to read ;-)]
;W[hp];B[iq];W[im]C[Nice combination by white.];B[lm];W[ln]
;B[ll];W[mm];B[om]C[Destroys one white eye....

But white is already out, so he is pretty safe.

p11 is still huge!];W[jo];B[fr]C[endgame move.

Another piece of advice:

If it looks like an endgame move, don't play it before the late middlegame, unless it makes or takes life.]
;W[eq];B[io]C[This looks tricky.  It would make me nervous if I was white ;-)]
;W[ip];B[jl];W[jm];B[hl]C[What is black doing now?

Still chasing white?  White is basically alive, so don't!

Building center territory?
P11 builds a huge territory!];W[pi];B[qj];W[oh];B[hn]C[Black is doing his best to kill!   (Actually, this is a pretty nice attack, now)]
;W[hm]C[Good response];B[gm]TR[jl][hl][hn][io][jp]C[None of blacks attacking marked stones are connected.  Let's see if white can take advantage]
;W[gn];B[go];W[fo];B[fn];W[in]C[nice attack.  black is short of liberties, so he can't connect.

Another concept...  Once your attack fails, let the attacking stones lie. Don't try to save them, they are now light.

Take sente elsewhere!];B[gn]C[This makes a heavy black group for white to attack]
;W[ho]C[White must capture.  He is connected to corner.  Alive.]
;B[il]C[Black does this to build center moyo I think.

Maybe attacking the p10 group is better.  Not sure];W[qi];B[qg]
C[Defends the corner.];W[rh];B[rn]C[Connects to q10 string.

Black made solid moves here.  But white is very threatening!]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[pg];B[og];W[qf]C[phk says "oops, little mistake from me"

Actually a pretty big mistake ;-)

White goes from 0 eyes to 1.  He can get another easily, so white has devastated black's territory.

Up to this point, black was winning by alot. Now the game is close.]
;B[pf];W[qh];B[re]C[I like this move. For many people, just drawing back like this is not obvious.  But it is better than the hane, I think]
;W[rj];B[ni];W[oi];B[nh];W[rk];B[rl];W[if]C[Beautiful move.    Black has invested many stones towards the center.   Look at the difference if black plays here!]
;B[jg];W[dk];B[dl]C[black is feeling feisty!];W[cl];B[ck];W[el]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[cn];W[co];B[bn];W[bo];B[eo];W[fp];B[fk]C[I really liked this black sequence!

e9 defends the cut and expands his moyo.  also tries to connect to left side group.  finally it attacks c7.

beautiful!];W[bm];B[an];W[em];B[en];W[dj];B[ci];W[di]C[By attacking white, black is forcing white to help black's only weak group live.  get it?]
;B[dh];W[ch];B[bh];W[eh];B[dg];W[bk];B[bi];W[fj];B[gj];W[fi]
C[Very nice job of white in living];B[gg]C[What is black trying to do with this move?

Threatening to cut?

In that case, cut!

"Never peep when you can cut"];W[gi];B[hj];W[ek]C[White is alive]
;B[ig];W[hf];B[hg]C[White's top is looking huge now!];W[eg]
;B[be]TR[dd][fd][jd][kd][ld]C[I would have preferred an immediate invasion, but now that i read the continuation...

I think it kills black's side group.  So never mind.

See all the marked white stones?  They are on the 4th line.  When your opponent has everything on the 4 th line, you really want to invade.      Probably about 50 moves ago, would have been ideal ;-)]
;W[bd];B[de];W[cd]C[By the way, the last 2 black and 2 white moves are a very common kyu sequence.  It is almost always bad for black.  What he just did was make white very solid. No invading the corner now!]
;B[ee]C[phk: I thought about E16 here too...];W[fe];B[ed];W[ec]
;B[gf];W[ge];B[bf];W[me];B[mf];W[ne];B[nf];W[je];B[jf];W[er]
;B[ff]C[phk:  H15 - J15 - F17 - H16 - D17 a possibility after this.]
;W[fc]C[phk: not anymore...

haha. hoping your opponent reads worse than you rarely works ;-)]
;B[gr];W[jq];B[jr]C[phk: wrong side?

Looks right to me];W[kq];B[kr];W[lq];B[lr];W[ao];B[es];W[ds]
;B[dr]C[not good.

You could have had the corner long ago... it is too late now :-(]
;W[fs];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[dq];B[bq];W[do];B[gs];W[rb]C[Good tenuki.  now this is pretty big]
;B[rc];W[ra];B[nm]C[this is a dame point.  That is not an eye he will fill.]
;W[mn]
(;B[qm]C[phk: small & in gote.  I do not know why I made this play.

glad you see it :-)

actually wasn't gote. Could have tenukied.  see var 2];W[fl]

;W[sl];B[sm];W[sk];B[sb];W[ef];B[oe];W[pm];B[rm];W[pa];B[sc]
;W[es];B[mb]C[phk:  My last attack turns out to be futile, but I had to try it.]
;W[mc];B[ic];W[kb];B[tt];W[qq];B[qp];W[rq];B[pr];W[pq];B[or]
;W[qr];B[sp];W[tt];B[tt]C[That was a great game!  Although many of my comments were negative, I feel good about both players.

I made a statement earlier about invading the top versus growing the center for black.  I said we'd count in the end.  So, top for white = 48.  Center for black = 19.  Final lesson is "There is no territory in the center."

In otherwords here is another proveb, "corner, side, center"

What I am trying to say is concentrate on the corners and sides for territory. If you have a really great attack going, you WILL get some in the center.  But, consider that territory a bonus!

Black made some fundamental errors that I tried to point out.  I hope he learns from them.  However, he also made some really clever moves, and great sequences!  I see a lot of potential in him.]

[df][cj]C[There are other variations... but this one is pretty simple.  All of a sudden the corner is black's.

Although now that I look at it... his marked stones are really surrounded.  White can make a nice attack.

Ok.  maybe k10 wasn't so bad ;-)]))
(;B[df];W[fd];B[dj]C[black is basically safe now.  And the corner is wide open for invasion.

Great for black.

))
(;B[dj];W[cl];B[cq]TR[dj][jp]C[White's shape is bad.  He cannot kill black.  and his influence will be neutralized by the marked stones after the joseki plays out.]

(;B[dj];W[co]C[This is a much better corner shape.  Although right now it would be far too slow to play c5.

So white will play elsewhere instead.    I hope it is clear why G4 is less than ideal]
