C[IGS Game on Sept. 29

B: endersgame (4k*) (requesting review)
W: takeutisnb (2k*)

Komi: 0.5];B[pp]C[I felt I was winning in the middle of the game.  I think I completely botched the endgame.  I would appreciate it if you could provide some general ideas for me to improve there, but also, I felt a lot of my moves were very slow.  In general, i think most of my problems deal with not keeping sente.

Thank you very much for reviewing my game! :-)

forfun (ff) - Thanks for giving me a very interesting game to review.  This was interesting from start to finish.  I felt that both players put a lot into the game and fought hard to the end.  Finally White's better technique overcame Black's initial lead.

In the beginning both players struggled with the issue of the correct "direction of play".  Both played from the direction of low, settled stones.  This is normally not the optimal direction since automatically the opportunities for future development are limited.

Once the fighting started there were some very interesting questions poised by the choices made on both sides.  I have tried to show some of the issues and possible alternatives.  Some of the individual moves were fun to analyze but perhaps the bigger question was about judging what were the biggest moves and what areas were not so interesting.

Later in yose again there were chances for both sides.  Some nice plays that the players saw and a few that they missed.  In the end White deserved the win but not by much.

I have tried to make my points as clear as possible and tried to illustrate most of them by variations.  I am sure that the variations contain a few errors and that there are many other improvements for both sides that I did not notice myself.  nevertheless I hope that the reader finds these comments helpful.]
;W[dp];B[pc];W[dd]
(;B[fq]C[ff - This is an unusual choice.  It is not unknown in professional play but is relatively rare.  With three corners starting with plays on the star points, the key question is what happens with the upper right.  Black normally chooses a strategy to settle this question immediately.  There are three main continuations that Black normally chooses from (see variations).]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[nq]C[ff - This should be in the upper right.  If white wants to play in the lower right, the approach should be from the other side at R6.  The point here is that black's stone at J3 is low so there is no great potential here.  White invades an uninteresting area.]

(;B[lq]C[ff - This play is too tight for the reasons mentioned for white's previous play.  Black is playing from the uninteresting side.  See the variation.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[qo]C[This
w move is a little strange.  I don't think i got as much advantage out of
it as I should have.

ff - White definitely should not push more here.  It is not necessary and each additional push just makes black stronger.]

(;B[qr]C[ff - This idea was OK.  Black could also just keep playing out at the top.  See the variation.]
;W[rr]
(;B[lo]C[ff - Sorry to say it but this move is completely wrong :-)  Black should simply connect (see variation).  It is important to understand that black should be delighted to have white try to escape with the lone stone on the bottom side.  Black's stones are low along the bottom.  As a result it is not easy to build territory here.  The best result for black is for white to agree to fight from this position.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qs];B[oq]
(;W[qm]C[ff - This is another completely wrong move.  White seems to be remembering the normal joseki without thinking about the differences here.  See the variation for another approach.]

(;B[cf]C[ff - This would be better from F17.  The upper side is much bigger potentially than the left side.  In order to assess the left side potential we need to consider two facts:

* The white stone at C6 is low.  It is not easy for white to build territory from this stone.  At the same time the white shape in the lower left is not secure if black gets to play a stone at C8 (threatens C2 next in such a situation).

* The black position on the lower side is very solid.  As a result, white can not invade and can not easily depress the position here in sente.]
;W[cj]C[ff - This is similar to black's play at M3 (a pincer played from an existing low position).  White should play at F17.  If a pincer is chosen it should probably be the more forceful play at D12, planning to emphasize the top while keeping pressure on the black stone.]
;B[fc]C[ff - A good choice.  Black should want to link up accros the top to the upper right corner.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[dc]
(;B[jc]C[ff - This seems like a reasonable idea, aiming at hooking up to the upper right, but it is a little slack in terms of the upper left.  White's stone at F15 has the potential to push out into the center and divide the upper and left sides on a favorable basis for white.  Black needs to be careful of the order of moves here.  If White manages to surround the stone at C14 on a large scale, suddenly White's plan turns out to have been effective.  See the variation.]
;W[ce]
(;B[ch]C[I
wanted to use c14 for something, but I don't think this was the way to do
it.  What is better than c12 here?

ff - By now something like D11, E11, or E10 is probably the best bet.  Black should try to lightly depress the left side before turning to the upper right corner.  The move played is just too heavy here.]
;W[ej]C[ff - White is happy to have black try to escape with these stones.  Black is suddenly in trouble.]
;B[fg];W[ge]C[ff - The exchange of G15 for H16 strengthens the upper side black group a lot.  This means that only the black stones on the left are weak.  Of course at present they are quite weak!]
;B[hd];W[bf];B[df];W[de];B[qe]C[This can't be the best move, but what should it be?

ff - One alternative idea would be for black to turn at H15 or jump to H13 in order to improve the linkage of the left-side stones.  The question then is whether or not black would be leading after white plays first against the upper right.  Maybe not!

Another idea would be to continue on the left with B13 and, if white replied at B15, attach underneath at B10 to see how black will reply.  If next black B9, white B11, white is almost alive and there is still the opportunity to later attach at B8 or cut at C9.  Black's left would not be territory yet so I think that black could afford to have white approach first in the upper right.

However, making shimari in the upper right to secure some territory there and expecting to fight it out on the left is one approach I think.  Black did not lose the game by making this choice.]
;W[oe]C[I've
never seen an approach like this.  Obviously he's aiming at p17, but I can't
decide whether top or right is more valuable. o17 next for me?

ff - This is one of the standard reduction plays against the shape in the upper right when Black also has a stone down the right side (a "double-wing formation").  The normal replies are either O16 (in which case white attaches at R14) or Q14 (in which case white attaches at P17 as in the game).]
;B[qh]C[ff - This should probably be at O16.  The stronger Black is on the top, the easier it is to look after the left-side stones.

When Black decides to play on the left, this move at R12 is a bit slack.  The reason is that White has many opportunities to use the attachment at R14 later.  Black should play more tightly at Q14 or R13 to help when White tries to settle the stone here.  Fundmentally though the low, strong White stone at R7 limits the possibilities on the right side so all the plays in this direction are somewhat lacking in potential for Black.]
;W[oc];B[pd];W[lc]
(;B[mc]C[ff - This was a pretty aggressive idea.  Alternatively what would white do if black played aroundL14 or L15, leaning on white while preparing to connect to the left side stones?]
;W[pb]
(;B[od];W[nc]
(;B[nd]C[I don't think o16 is right either.

ff - I tend to agree that by now Black has some problems to solve.  See the variation.]
;W[mb]
(;B[qb]C[ff - The preceding plays do not make sense if Black has to backtrack to here.]
;W[md]C[ff - This is a huge move that secures White's group in the middle of Black's earlier framework.]
;B[cl]
(;W[dk];B[dm]
(;W[fo]C[ff - This looks too slow as it threatens nothing against Black's low stones on the bottom.]
;B[fm]C[2
weak groups for me, but I don't mind the c14 group that much.  I think it
will survive.

ff - There are now three weak groups (counting the top) not two.  Black is taking some big chances here.]

find a good response here.  K13 just seemed natural, so I played it without
seeing any clear advantage from it.];W[eg]C[Ouch.];B[ef];W[ff]

(;B[fh]C[ff - This is a reading error by Black of course that should be played at E12 instead.  See the variation.]
;W[eh];B[ei]
(;W[fi];B[di];W[gg];B[gh];W[hh];B[dj]C[I think this saved the situation from being a complete disaster.]

;B[ck];W[cr];B[om]C[Trying to build moyo.];W[jk]C[I couldn't find a good response to k9.

ff - Both sides are playing small moves here.  White is very strong in the center after capturing the three Black stones.  This move is very narrow considering that strength.]
;B[qk];W[rl];B[rk];W[lg]C[ff - White does not appreciate how the top Black group has been weakened.  This should probably be at K16.]
;B[je]C[ff - Stengthens the top whle connecting to the center.  This is a very important move for Black.]
;W[ie];B[id];W[jf];B[kf];W[if]
(;B[le]C[ff - This looks like it is too easy on White.  See the variation.]
;W[kg];B[me];W[kd];B[ke];W[kb];B[jd]C[I couldn't see  for sure that the group would live by itself, so I played safe.]
;W[ob];B[ng]C[ff - This is a big move and nice for Black.  The question now is - who is winning?  I would judget that the two sides are about even.  The result will depend on what happens from now on...]
;W[ki]C[ff - This is a very tight move that is too small.  The black stone at K13 can't possibly move out so there is no meaningful threat for Black to play here.  I think that White should probably jump down to K7.]

(;B[km]C[ff - This is a kind of "in between" move.  It protects an area of little interest because the Black stones there are very close together (= not very efficient).  A play around O10 looks bigger.  However, see the variation for the play that I think is key for understanding this position.]
;W[gp];B[gq]C[This is where my sente problems begin.  The next 30 or so moves, he is on the attack.]
;W[ip]
(;B[jp]C[I don't think k4 is right?

ff - If Black doesn't see the weakness at E5, this is natural.  It is the next move that is a problem for Black.]
;W[io]C[ff - Playing E5 is now complicated W has plays around J7 to try to break out toward the top.  Black has suffered a big loss here.]
;B[hq]C[ff - There is no reason to play here.  Black should be looking at O10 or B6]
;W[en];B[em]C[ff - White covers the defect at E5 in sente but since Black has become thin around J7 there is a certain sense to answering here.]
;W[er];B[eq];W[dq];B[fr]C[ff - This is a small move.  Naturally White does not answer at this time.  Again O10 or B6 catch the eye.]
;W[ll]C[ff - The sequence that starts here and ends with White O11 is unfortunate for Black.  Answering White's hane along the bottom is necessary but answering here and then answering O8 as well are very small.  Once Black connects at E7, the only reason to answer here is to save about 2 points of territory.

Big points for Black are:
* O10 to expand Black's territory while limiting White's.
* B7 the classic double-sente diagonal play on the edge.  * D6 which threatens to cut at E4.  If White answers at D5, Black can attach at B6 instead of B7.
* E18 followed by a hane and connect if White answers at D18.]

(;B[lm]C[ff - Black is believing everything that White is suggesting, "this is important, better protect!"  See the variation for another approach.]
