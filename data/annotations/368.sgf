[qk:D][qj:E][pj:F][qq:G]C[7 is a good move

a is not really the same as 7 as there is a shimari
(2 stones on the corner) in front of it. I don't know
wich side is better in that case.

b,d,e,f are also possible.   i dislike c because white may play a pincer at d,e or f.

g is of course too early and would give a too big influence
to white.];W[fc];B[df];W[ed]LB[dc:A][de:B]C[10 is an unusual move.

It forces blacks to settle his corner, and black is
happy to do it. Important is how he does that.

b (the game) defends the left side but black stones
are overconcentrated. Moreover it doesn't defend the corner.

a (see the variation 2) defends both.]
(;B[de];W[fe]LB[dc:A]C[a was a bigger point but 12 is tricky. White wants to have
a big moyo on the top.];B[dc]C[Here, one see that 11 was not useful. Blacks has
to defend in 13];W[dg]LB[jd:A][eg:B][cg:C]C[White should have played around a instead.

I don't think that 14 is a working invasion. But even
if it works, it's too early, black will not play a move
around 14 in the next few moves, so it will always be
possible.

So how black should respond now ?

c is very conservative. It wants the left side territory,
but forget to think to the big white top moyo.

b is more appropriate.  Even if you are not sure at 100% to
capture the stone 14, in attacking it, you will get influence  and thickness, and you will reduce the top white moyo.   Note that If black miss to capture 14, it will have to play  f14 if it doesn't want to be cut in e14.   Note that "a" will be a very big point at any moment.]
;B[cg];W[dh];B[ch];W[di]LB[kc:A][jd:B]C[It might for black the time to invade at a or b.

At this time, it is not difficult to make one eye here and
to make the other in the center.

C11 is also a  big move but i would have play at b.];B[ci];W[ck]LB[dk:A]
[cj:B]C[I would have played at a but b isn't for sure a bad move.];B[cj]
;W[dl];B[nq]LB[jd:A][ek:B][ff:C][kc:D][ej:E][fj:F]C[I would have not played 23 there.

Consider the following moves instead:

a,d:         I invade the top moyo. I can not accept that white is        playing here.  it's too big.
      An invasion will be more and more difficult. I think
      it's the right moment.

b,e,f:         I Like this moves because it attacks 2 groups at the
      same time. I might capture one of them or get a        big influence instead.
          Moreover my group is no more confined in the corner.
      This will help the invasion i intend to do on the top side.
c
         c  cut two weak groups and i wont' be confined in the
      corner.This reduces also the top side moyo.];W[oq];B[np];W[ie]C[Due to the inappropriate move at 23. Now white
had time to play 26. Making things more difficult to blacks.   Black here can anyway still cut the weak white groups.]
;B[fp]LB[fq:A][cn:B][ff:C][fj:D][qk:E][eg:F][cq:G]C[27 doesn't defend the corner. The invasion is still possible in g.

a does it better (white can only get a ko to live in the corner)

b does the same butt attacks the white group so is even  better than a.

c,f,d are also still good (see the comment on move 23)

e is now a big point. It can also be played higher.];W[do];B[cp];W[co];B
[pj]LB[qk:A][qj:B]C[A very good move.   It's good to play a high move because you  want also contest the center and the big white moyo.

a and b might be too low.];W[pl];B[qn]LB[pf:A][pe:B][pn:C][nj:D][ok:E][pg:F]
[qg:G][ld:H][nf:I][og:J]C[Move 33 is very important and quite difficult. Only a  stronger player could tell you where to play.

I would envisage a move around all this points in addition
to where black played.];W[pn]C[Now we leave opening strategy to concentrate  on the fight.]
;B[ql];W[qo]
(;B[qm];W[qk]LB[pk:A][rk:B]C[Here black has 2 choices: a and b.

Playing b is really horrible and should be played
only if "a" fails.

I think that  black can capture the stone 38 with a.
The variation 2 shows how to make it but it's quite
complex.]
(;B[rk]C[.];W[qj];B[ro];W[rj];B[sl];W[rn];B[rm];W[sn];B[rp];W[sj];B[qp]
;W[po];B[so];W[sk]LB[qq:A][ff:B][fj:C][ld:D][og:E][jj:F]MA[rn][sn]C[53 (The next move) at s8 is horrible.   Black should play a if he wants a big corner.
But he might also play at b,c,d,e or f.   The black s4 group is alive. The first eye is done
with the 2 marked stones that are captureds.

The second eye is in T4. White can not play s3  because black will respond in a and will capture
the stone.

So S8 save one point in gote and make the white
move Q7 sente. There is no worse move on the board
that s8];B[rl];W[pm]MA[qn][qm][ql][rk][rl][rm][sl]C[White make atari. As black should respond,
the connection Q7 is "sente". It's why s8 was so bad.

Black should respond to the atari in capturing the two
stones in T7. Once again he can get another eye in T4.];B[qq]C[JFK, You should have seen the atari.]
;W[sm]C[Of course!];B[or]C[Good move];W[pq];B[pr];W[bp];B[bq];W[bn]LB[aq:A]
[cq:B]C[Play at a or elsewhere. Not at b.   a defends more than b and  get more points.

a is anyway still a small move and should be played
during the endgame.];B[cq];W[eb];B[db];W[lp];B[lq];W[mo];B[fj]MA[pj]C[Good move!

Your left group is 100 time alived. So profit
to get out and help other stones (for example
 the marked stone)];W[ej]C[70 is a mistake.

See the variation 2 too see how to respond.]
(;B[ek];W[ei];B[dk];W[fk]LB[gk:A][fl:B]MA[pj][ej][ei][di][dg][dh][jp]C[a is better because of the marked stones.]

(;B[fl];W[gk];B[fn]LB[cm:A][cl:B][bk:C][ap:D]C[77 is good if you intend to kill white left group

If you think:

"It's a forced move because if white play tennuki  (elsewhere) i will  play the next move at a,b,c or d  and i will kill white."

If it was not your intention, it's a bad move.

You have to do instead something on the top, even
if it will be difficult.];W[gj];B[cl]C[good];W[bk]
(;B[dm]C[see instead variation 2 of the last move.];W[bl];B[cm];W[bm];B
[bj];W[ak]C[86 is a bad move it should have been played
at a instead. White would have been alived.

Now Black can kill white:

see variation 2.]
(;B[jl]C[If the left group should not have been killed, 87
would have been a good move.];W[am]LB[ao:A]C[The best way to live is in a.

Now black can kill by ko!];B[ap]C[Good.   Here black doesn't risk anything to try the ko.

White risks life instead.];W[ao];B[bo];W[em]
(;B[el];W[bp];B[en]LB[pc:A][fi:B][lc:C][ld:D][no:E]C[95  is a very poor threat.   It's value is one or two points.

Playing on the top or at b would have been better.

e is smaller but it's a threat.];W[bo]LB[aq:A]C[taking 89 at a was slightly better than 91.

But there is no other moves than a and 91.];B[aq]LB[ld:A]C[Don't play 97 now.   It's value is 3-4 points gote and should be played
during the endgame. If white take in 97 simply ignore
it!

If white is the first to play at a or  if it's you,  the difference can be huge! It's now a matter of 20 points!]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[mp];B[lr];W[kp];B[kq];W[no];B[jq]C[It's not useful. You are strong in the area.

Play on the top or in the center.];W[gm];B[fm];W[gl]C[very gote for white.

it should play on the top or around the center instead.];B[jn]C[good.

Now after the moves 106-108, it's not bad to
reinforce before invading on the top.];W[jk];B[ec];W[ea]C[112 shows clearly that 111 was not apropriate.]
;B[ee];W[fd];B[ll]LB[kk:A]C[the hane at a is better.

It's more and more difficult to invade at the top now.
but black should not wait furthermore];W[lk];B[kl]C[Play at the top.];W
[ff];B[ld]C[It's quite late to do this invasion, but black
has no choice here.];W[le];B[jd];W[md];B[id]LB[ke:A]C[a would have been better.

Now the following fight is quite standard  with some
good and less good moves.

It's quite normal that black has a lot of difficulties to  make even one eye. The invasion was too late but  necessary.

Altough Black will win the fight quite miraculously. He should
remember to invade earlier.];W[kd];B[kc];W[lc];B[ke];W[ld];B[je];W[kf];B

White had very well played until here. With
only one move, it loses.

White should play at a and will capture easily the black
group.];B[ik];W[il];B[kk];W[kj];B[lj]LB[fh:A][ge:B]C[177 should have been played at a instead.

This kill white that have only one eye in b.

a is worth around 90 points.];W[fh]LB[eg:A][ef:B]C[178 is very good.
It's worth around 90 points.
