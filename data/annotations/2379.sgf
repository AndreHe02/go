C[Strange move but not completly wrong. When there are so open spaces I think it's early to play move like this. Of course I prefer k3 and I have some feeling with r9.]
;W[rj];B[rh]C[I don't like this because white can now keep separeted two black groups. There are no danger in life and death now but in this way you brake your possible influence. I prefer r11 if you want to play here.]

(;B[ni]C[completely wrong! Run faster then your opponent];W[og]

;B[mg];W[lh];B[kj];W[jn]C[this is a big move for both players]

;W[dk];B[dl];W[cl];B[ck];W[dj];B[em];W[ci];B[dn]C[the last moves are too heavy and f8 and j9 are difficult to connected. When you invade try to stay lighter and with your stones. And for the connection remember the proverb: a one space jump is always (or almost :)) a good move]
