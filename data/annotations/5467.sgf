C[Hi,

I am Guillaume G., 5D on KGS. I hope you'll find some of the comments useful in your other games, not just for this one.]
;B[pd];W[oq];B[dd];W[do]LB[po:B][qp:A]C[In this situation, you can also consider B : it makes good use of your ni ren sei at the top, flatten white's formation and also avoid a direct "jump in" which may be exactly what white wants. There is also nothing wrong with A, of course.]

(;B[qp];W[pn];B[op];W[np]CR[pn]LB[np:4][op:3][qp:1][oq:2]C[I think this move is not joseki.
I played p5 which seemed good to me.

This is an old joseki, the result isn't clear good for black. It got outdated because it leaves white with a peep in front of a bamboo jump which is considered to be a bad shape.

This shape is similar to a joseki with a different move order, as I noted it here, this is the reason why the result isn't that bad for white. If you consider this in this order, then the move 3 isn't so good because it helps white a lot, however the marked stone is useless, so this result is close to even. I used CGoban 3 to do the marking, so if it doesn't render correctly, you may have to use it too.]
;B[oo];W[pr]C[This move has no meaning whatsoever, seems like white failed to notice the shape I was talking about.]

(;B[no]LB[pq:A]C[I don't like this move, instead I'd play at A. The reason why I don't like it is that it fixes white's shape, push on the fourth line and doesn't really do much when it comes to setting black.]
;W[mp]C[Now black is left with similar problems from before, except that he made the push. Now that you started, it looks natural to continue]

(;B[ql]C[Black's shape is not so good, I think this is an okay result for white, despite two strange moves.]
;W[qq]C[This is good, fix Q2 problem.];B[rp];W[pk]C[This move has no real meaning]
;B[pl]C[This is the only move, and black should be happy with this result, Q9 only helped black.]
;W[ok];B[rj]C[I'd push at P8 first, because white's P8 is almost sente, which is very displeasing.]
;W[ol];B[om];W[nm];B[pm];W[ph];B[mo]C[This move is a mistake, I feel, I'll tell why in a few moves]
;W[lp];B[dq]LB[kn:C][mo:A][lp:B]C[This move is of course very good. Now the question is wether the A for B exchange is good or not ? 

It gave white some territory. Is A sente for white ? No, it isn't. What happens if white takes A ? White links 2 living groups. Does it serve as a large scale moyo ? Not really, D3 is right in the middle, and because A is gote, there is no time for white to play it. Maybe later it'll become an important point, but for now, this isn't really a good idea for white.

What is going on here is that A is a vital point for the shape, but not a vital point for the whole board. Such vital points should be taken no matter what when they are sente for both sides, but here, if white takes it, it's gote, if black takes it, it's sente but it gives white some fourth line territory. Also, black A serves no purpose for black. it'll just be there. Please note that white can recover much of the influence lost by playing at C so this is the final reason why A is a bad move in this situation.

There is a last reason that we'll see in a few moves. (Yes, one more reason !)]
;W[fp];B[co];W[cn];B[cp];W[dn]
(;B[fr]C[I don't like this move very much, but it feels mandatory, because of the exchange we have been talking about for some time now.

Instead... (see variation)];W[cf];B[fd];W[di]
(;B[ic]CR[co][cp][dq][fr]LB[mo:A][no:B]C[This move makes nice shape, but it'd be better at K17, it makes better balance with Q16 and if white plays C17, the resulting corner isn't too small.

But it feels very gote and somehow, white's influence is starting to radiate a bit too much to my taste. In this situation, I'd consider a move at M7 (variation)

This move, as well as A and B are probably the "mistakes" of this fuseki. By "mistake", I don't mean that those are absolutely bad moves, they "do" something, but not enough when you compare to what 1) you could have gotten (black Q3), 2)  you gave to white in exchange. White's stone work well together, however the bottom left corner group has no use and has a low position. White's shape on the right is especially nice.]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[he];W[kg];B[qf]
(;W[pc]LB[hg:A]C[This move doesn't seem very consistent. As white, I'd consider A first.]
;B[qc];W[oc];B[qb];W[od];B[pe]
(;W[gq]C[This game is difficult for black, but not lost yet.  The reasons are obvious : white got an edge in the bottom right fight, then you lost sente with K17.]
;B[hr];W[dp];B[cq];W[gr];B[gs];W[iq];B[bd]C[Q: Was B15 better ?

B15 or B16 misses the focus point of the game : white's 
center. 

That being said, B16 is better shape, it aims at B14, while B15 can be blocked by white B14 and then should be defended. White won't play B14 right away, but with good timing, it can make B16 turn out bad.]
;W[hg]LB[eb:30][rd:12][rn:15][br:13][mr:15]C[With this, I think the game is close to being over. It's now very difficult for black to win. Let's count a bit ...

So black has about 60+ points, but no potential.

White has 15+ at the bottom, which can easily extend to up to 25. 

So white needs to make only 45 points or so on the left side + middle. This doesn't seem like a very tough challenge.]
;B[ch]C[This move may be a mistake considering what we just said. You are just helping white to make a bigger center. Capturing C14 is not enough.]

(;W[be]
(;B[dg]C[I think I messed up thing here.
I didn't know how to reply to b15

D13 is the good idea (fighting spirit), but it may be a bit slack, because it puts no pressure on D12.]

;B[da];W[ab]C[This final result is difficult to judge. Locally, this is a disaster for black. But globally, considering that white's main potential was the center, this may be okay. I'd say that black lost about 5 points in this exchange, no more.]
;B[nf];W[md];B[ci];W[kc];B[jb]C[This move is very strange. I can't understand? the top is already open with R18 so this is kinda doing the same twice...]
;W[id];B[hd];W[mg];B[jk];W[jm]

;W[kn];B[jn];W[im];B[ko];W[ln];B[lo];W[lm];B[kl];W[ng];B[hk]
C[Finally, you play here, but all those exchange helped white. White also got to play O14 magically ! (you still play H9 in gote, but somehow, white got one more stone than if you played just H9, hence the "magically")]
;W[fi];B[in];W[hm];B[gm];W[hn];B[gn];W[ho]C[those exchanges are good for white. white's hane at G8 makes all of them meaningless.]

The fuseki was okay, but you underestimated white's thickness way too much, this lead to a difficult game.

In the chuban, you missed an opportunity to kill or make white suffer a lot. You also tried too hard when you invaded the center : as a rule, you shouldn't make forcing moves unless you have a good reason, and here, you just had to make an ikken tobi, so just playing it would have been enough. You managed to escape and kill one little group, but at the cost of making white very strong at the bottom, and at the top too, let alone giving him some little forcing moves at many places. Even if he only gains two points every time, if it's at 10 places, then it's still twice more than when you capture the 5 stones in the center.  

The yose was bad for you, you should probably look at this game again and try to see if you can do better now.]

Of course, if you don't protect the corner, then white will take it, and then H13 was just a sente move which makes good shape and more influence in the center. It'd be actually bad for black to play anything else than P17 : H13 and P17 are sort of miai.]

In other words, playing at M7 makes the game more balanced and make it "open ended".]

This may be a matter of taste, but because of the exchange, I wouldn't like to let white play E2 in sente.
