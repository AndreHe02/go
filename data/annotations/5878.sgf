C[Hi,

I glad to loof at your game. I'm only 5 kyu, all my comments should be consedered as IMHO.
 
Here in the fuseki both white and Black did a lot mistakes, and also both of them did wrong calculation during the fights. Black's mistake was fatal.

My comments will be marked by ">" sign

Alexey.


Dear reviewer,



This game went downhill for my opponent after a while, so I would like u to review for him. He managed to kill my group but was perhaps not aggressive enough.



Thx,
