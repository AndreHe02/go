C[CD: Hello, I am Chris and I will be your reviewer today. I will prefix my comments with "CD" like done with this one.
Both players could do with a bit of practice doing tesuji problems as is evidenced from how the joseki in the lower
left corner at the start of the game is played. The biggest issue with the game is that Black fails to protect his
right side on move 89. This is the mistake that loses Black the game.

k56 [12k\]: hi,gg
adamz11 [12k\]: hi gg];B[pq];W[pd];B[dd];W[cq];B[dp]C[CD: Approaching now might be a bit early, but as such D4 is fine as an approach move. Usually this approach is played if White has
stones around C10 and K3 too, to redude the amount of territory that White would potentially get. Other approach moves are F4 and
D6 if you want to do something on either side. The timing of this move is not the biggest issue here, though. The biggest issue is that
both players play the joseki rather badly.

I did not know joseki for how to appraoch 3,3 as B.];W[cp];B[dq]
C[CD: This move by Black is bad. In general the shape you create here with two pairs of stones touching each other like this is in many
cases bad, because it is too easy for the opponent to just hane. D5 is the right move both in the joseki and in general in this shape.]
;W[do]C[CD: Good move by White. This punishes the wrong move D3 by Black.]
;B[co]C[CD: Oops! If White next plays C6 this black stone is captured.]
;W[bo]C[CD: Again oops! White misses that he could capture the black stone.]
;B[cn];W[bn];B[dn]C[CD: I prefer C7 instead here. You provoke E5 by playing this and that hurts your stones below. You defend the stones below later, but
then the C5 group gets a bit weak.];W[eo];B[fq];W[go];B[hq]
;W[cl];B[fn]C[CD: This allows White to march right through your stones by playing E6, so it is not a good move.]
;W[en];B[em]C[CD: White seems to be missing quite a lot. White playing D7 captures three stones.]
;W[fo];B[dl];W[cm];B[dm];W[fm];B[dk]C[CD: Yes, you cannot save the stone on F6 or the C5 group would have been captured in a ladder.]
;W[fl]C[At this point I felt cramped and unsure of how to use this B group without giving W a huge wall to the center.]
;B[ck]C[CD: This move is a success for Black. It stops the white group on the side from marching upwards any further and the upper left side
starts to look like something that might become something for Black.]
;W[bl];B[cg]C[CD: I prefer B9 for Black instead. It walls off the upper left side. Note that after move 37 the stone on C13 is too close to the other
black stones. This proves that playing C13 is questionable.]
;W[bk];B[ci]C[CD: Yes, you cannot play B10 because White would do B11, but this creates an overconcentration of Black stones around here.]
;W[cj];B[dj];W[bj];B[di];W[qo];B[np];W[rq];B[qg]C[CD: This approach seems to be from the wrong side. Black has potential on the upper side, so the approach sould be at O17. It is not that
White has so much potential on the right side that you need to jump in right away. O17 works very well with the enclosure in the
upper left corner.];W[nc];B[qk];W[fc];B[fe];W[db];B[cc];W[cb]
;B[jc]C[CD: I think this move is okay. Either K17 or K18 seem fine to me. A dan level player would probably have an opinion about it, but
the follow up moves are the bigger problem.

Is this too low to invade? What would have been a better move here?]
;W[id];B[kd]C[CD: From a point of view of shape, a diagonal move should usually be answered by attachting to the diagonal stone. Here that would be
K16 or J17. I prefer K16. The problem with playing L16 becomes apparent in a few moves. The white play M17 on move 56 is painful
because you have to anser it.];W[jd];B[ic];W[hd];B[ke];W[lc]
;B[kc];W[hc];B[io];W[hn];B[in];W[im];B[jm];W[nn]
(;B[po]C[CD: The problem with most of these cutting sequences is that you tend to lose the stone on Q3. I added a variation that does not
suffer from this problem

W's large knight seems cuttable, is this the right move?];W[pn]

;B[mp];W[oq];B[mq];W[pl];B[ql];W[ol];B[nm];W[nl];B[mm];W[pi]
;B[qi];W[pj]C[CD: It looks very risky to me not to answer this move. If fact, you get into big trouble on the right side later.]
;B[ml];W[nk];B[mk];W[qh];B[rh];W[qj];B[pk];W[nj];B[rj];W[ri]
;B[ph]C[CD: The only solution to this problem is to not get into it in the first place. Black should have defended the right
side with his move 89, as pointed out.

B has really bad shape here, I did not know how to salvage the situation here.]
;W[qi];B[ro];W[rg];B[qf];W[rf];B[oh];W[oj]C[CD: O11 is better from the point of view of shape. It makes it harder for Black on the outside.]
;B[nf];W[lf];B[mh];W[mg];B[nh];W[mf];B[of]C[CD: What is the purpose of this move by Black? There is a much more important issue: playing T9 to save the
life of the black group in the lower right.];W[ng];B[mj];W[rk]
;B[kf];W[kg];B[if];W[jf];B[je];W[jg];B[ie];W[ge];B[gf];W[ff]
;B[he];W[gd];B[fg];W[ef];B[ee];W[eg];B[gh];W[fh];B[hh]C[CD: Why does Black not simply defend at G13 instead? G13 threates to capture some white stones by E12, so White has
to answer.];W[gg];B[hg];W[hf];B[lh];W[lg];B[gf];W[og];B[pg]
;W[me];B[fi];W[hf];B[ig];W[gf];B[df];W[ji];B[jh];W[kh];B[ki]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[ih];B[li];W[ij];B[hi];W[jk]C[CD: There is nothing Black can do but resign at this point. Since the black group in the lower right is dead, White is
far ahead.

W jumped into the center and I was at a loss for how to catch up in the game now, is there anything B could have done to get the upper hand?]
;B[il];W[hm];B[hl];W[jl];B[ii]C[Here, I ran out of time, too much thinking.

Any recommendations overall to improve my playing, ie creating good shape, playing solidly,etc. would be much appreciated, thank you!]
