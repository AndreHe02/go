C[Review requested for White (Googol [8k\] KGS)



In this game I played something very unusual for me: from influence. By Black move 81 I've built some walls facing center and when he played too close to them, I didn't attack the stones directly but tried to circumvent and then surround them. I failed to do that. So, I have the following questions:



1) How did I have to handle my influence properly?

2) After I realized that I cannot kill the Black dragon, I thought that I wasted my influence and resigned. Was my resignation premature?

3) Any general advice you have.
