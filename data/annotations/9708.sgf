[qr][rr][sr][as][ns][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Paps: well some good ideas! cutting at the top left when your opponent makes a mistake is nice, some good end game moves too.

to improve you have to be more carefull with the direction: 
Play away from strong stones and don't damage your own stones by helping your opponent to strengthen so he can attack you more conveniently

Direction was the biggest problem with your play in this game : loosing bottom stones left stone was too big!

Take care of your cutting stones

Avoid to play moves gaining almost nothing (too close to your strong stones, in the center, connecting living groups..)

train to study tsumegos

And first of all: HAVE FUN!!
