C[dear reviewer.

in this game i played black, and i was certain i was totally devistating my opponent, but somehow he made territory in the center and it got really close.

i would be really gratefull if you could point out my mistakes in this game, and how i oculd handle the white groups in the center in a more efficent way.

any help is greatly appreciated.];B[pp];W[pd];B[cp];W[cd];B[iq]
;W[ic];B[pf]LB[ed:C][qf:A][dg:B]C[any better way to approch the chinese fuseki?

----------
I think this is a fine way to begin approaching it. A, B, and C are some other options as well.]
;W[mc]LB[pj:A]C[this looked like a sort of overplay... so i tried to take adventage of that and get white in to a low position while creating a strong group for myself.]

(;B[ne]TR[pj]C[----------
This seems fine, but maybe not just yet. Pulling back on the right side or starting to move on the left are fairly big, and white isn't likely to remove your ability to play this O15 move any time soon. I would personally play the marked point and try to turn this into a moyo.]
;W[qj]LB[qm:A]C[that seemed like a huge mistake... now i can seal white in.]

(;B[nc];W[qf];B[qg];W[pe];B[of];W[oc];B[nb];W[ob]LB[rf:A]C[----------
A is a good point to take while you are sealing white in. It is sente and puts to rest any thoughts of white connecting back to his corner.]

(;B[md];W[lb]LB[dg:A]C[had no idead while i played the next move... luckily my oppnent let me undo]

(;B[dg]LB[ed:A][qm:B]TR[cp][iq]C[----------
I like this version much more, it is in good harmony with your other stones on the board and plants the seeds of a grand scale moyo with the other marked stones. White should have a tough time answering this well.

It feels strange playing it perhaps, but I think it is a great move and only wish you had stuck with it instead of the more usual variation. Many people I've played with seem to disregard this option outright, but thinking outside the box like this can often be a good thing!

Some variations of White continuing at A or B next follow.]

(;W[ed]C[----------
If white continues as he has, quietly taking territory, it becomes Black's game absolutely. White's stone on the right is very lonely and can easily be attacked.]
;B[qm];W[oj];B[mj]C[----------
Things become very difficult for White's group, Black has all but won already having the offensive and greater territory potential across the board]
)
(;W[qm]LB[ed:B][hd:D][oj:C][np:A]C[----------
If White catches on to his weakness here and reinforces, things still look good for Black. A-D a few points to consider next.]

(;B[oj];W[rp];B[om]C[----------
White is not likely to die, but this keeps in check with your idea of keeping white's position low.]

(;B[np];W[ed];B[dj]C[----------
Quiet continuation, but Black maintains a large advantage with the growing moyo.]

;B[dd];W[cc]LB[qm:A]C[----------
C15 seals up the left side a little, but is a little small given the rest of the board. Now is a perfect time to attack White's lone stone on the right.]

(;B[ce];W[oj]
(;B[fq]LB[pl:A][np:B]TR[pg]C[----------
This is good locally, but the white group moving into the center is far more pressing. Now's almost the last chance to prevent the center turning into what it does in the real game. A, or even B, are good ways to start remedying this. The cut at the marked point could become troublesome, but isn't just yet (shown in A line).]
;W[rf];B[ph];W[rh]
(;B[lc]LB[ie:B][np:A]C[----------
A little small and slow. A or B help on a larger scale.];W[mb]
;B[kc];W[na];B[nd];W[kb];B[jd];W[mq];B[qn];W[jj];B[dj]C[----------
This is good timing, protect your assets and prepare for the big showdown in the center.]
;W[hf];B[id];W[hc];B[hd];W[gd];B[ge];W[he];B[fd];W[gc];B[jc]
C[----------
White is alive on both sides so this is rather small at the moment. It turns out fine because White answers, but it could easily have led to a lost opportunity.]

Right thinking! This also helps your now-severed top group in potentially gaining a few points.]

Now may be a good time to attack the stone sitting on the bottom with A, as this breaks up the growing center a bit. This is the very last chance to get in there significantly.]

Better than connecting outright is capturing S9, it's a decent gain in yose here.]

(;B[km]CR[jn]TR[il][kq]C[too deep.. can never seem to figure out how deep can i go in these situations... any advice?

----------
Close, but indeed deep. An easy way to consider these situations is to draw an imaginary line on the border of White's area between the stones you are invading. (The two marked ones, in this case.) Then try to play along this line and not cross it heavily. In our case here, our imaginary line almost perfectly strikes through K6, a good point to reduce from!]

The ability to capture the marked stone for an eye helps here, but simply connecting is better than trying to push into white's territory.]

----------
Well played game! Fuseki was particularly nice, I thought. White's stone on the right side got very out of control when it should have been weak. Work on taking advantage of those sorts of weaknesses early while they still exist, especially in cases like this where you had stones everywhere to utilize. 

The right thinking and strategy was there for the most part all game, but a few mistakes in direction like the above added up fairly quickly. Yose was also pretty sharp and I feel is what maintained the small advantage kept after the center slips.

Hope the comments help and good luck in your future Go!

Simple slipup for sure, but it was a costly one this late in the game. A big difference in just defending.]

White can rescue this stone or continue taking the center, getting both is unlikely. Either way, you gain.]

Correct about the cut. It leaves you this nasty thorn in your side. Better to play it safe as you did in the real game.]

(;B[fe]C[----------
Your way works almost the same but connecting might be a little more bold for you and nervewracking for White; there is more on the line suddenly. (~10 points difference)]
;W[fh];B[ij]C[----------
This is a little rougher, White has better shape to start than he otherwise would, but all is not lost, this can still be a good fight for Black.]

(;B[ij];W[hj];B[ik]C[----------
Keeping this simple yields better results. The more White struggles to get out, the tighter Black's grip becomes, as there is almost nowhere to run to on the left.]

(;B[np]C[----------
A move like this is still very large, even though it appears slow. The left side is also very big but I feel the corner is more pressing with white's new presence on the right side.]

White has sente at least, but loses some of his corner and the marked point becomes bad aji in his shape. Black is still on the offensive.]

(;B[np]C[----------
The more secure option. Does not attack as strongly, but black still holds the lead so this is fine.]
))
(;B[qm];W[oj];B[mj]C[----------
After your press in the top left, there are even less places for White to try running to. The problem with white taking so much of the center stems from letting this group get a move here before you did.]

(;B[rf];W[qe]LB[qc:A]C[----------
There is also the strong possibility of harassing White at A or even killing if the situation gets any tougher on White.]
))
(;B[qm]C[----------
White is alive up top even after the shut-in, so now may be a good time to start at this. If you don't feel confident about the floating Q14 stones this can come after the shut-in you played where your top becomes a bit stronger.]
