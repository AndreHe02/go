C[Hello, my name is Jorik Mandemaker and I'll review this game as requested by black. I'm only an 11k player myself so a stronger player might disagree with my advice, but i'll try to make it as helpfull as possible.

I've marked the rest of my comments with a J. If I use some (japanese)terms you don't understand you can look them up at http://senseis.xmp.net]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[cd];B[pk];W[nc];B[qf];W[kc];B[ep];W[gq]

(;B[dn]C[J: With this move you let white connect underneath while making a group on the left side. However there is no reason to just let white connect underneath and take territory like that. Take a look at the variation for a different way to play here.]
;W[eq];B[co];W[bo];B[bn];W[do]
(;B[cm]C[I should maybe not have accepted a KO at C6, I do not know if this is the reason, but I have the feeling the next part is rather ugly with all the KOs.

J: There is nothing to gain here by playing this ko. If you later fill it at C6 then C7 is a useless stone. It's best to just connect. See the variation.]
;W[an];B[am];W[cn];B[ao];W[ap];B[co];W[an]
(;B[dj]C[J: I think it's better to connect the ko here. If you do you could play D4 and the ladder to capture D5 would work. So white probably adds a defensive move and you can extend anyway. See the varation.]
;W[cn];B[ao];W[co];B[cf];W[fd];B[ef];W[kq];B[mq];W[jn];B[eo]
C[That move was a try to connect E4 with the rest, but now it seems rather obvious it won't work, too many weaknesses in my side, isn't it ?

J: yes especially the cut at D7 looks like it could be trouble.]

(;W[an];B[bm];W[en];B[dm]C[J: this is less severe then the cut at D7 but it would have been better not to play E5 and provoke this sequence.]
;W[fn];B[mn];W[gj];B[fl];W[gl];B[gf];W[kf];B[mf];W[ki];B[mi]
C[J: White is basically building your moyo. You should be very pleased with this.]
;W[ll];B[nl]C[J: Your moyo might still be invadable. playing R6 instead would make an invasion more  difficult.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb]
(;B[hd]MA[fd][kc]C[J: Tenuki is a good idea. While Q18-R17 was big R18 is too small. 

However you can go deeper into white's moyo. The marked stones are far appart and the corner is still quite weak. See the varation for a few possibilities.]
;W[hc]
(;B[if]C[I guess this should be played at E12, I was over-enthusiastic in invating white's Moyo.

J: I think you should go further inside white's moyo actually. I've added a few more varations.]
;W[eh];B[fi]C[J: A bit risky but it worked out quite well for you.]
;W[gi];B[fh];W[bf];B[bg];W[be];B[df]C[J: Connecting at C13 is a bit better. Since it also takes care of this connection.]
;W[hg];B[hf];W[jg];B[ig];W[hh];B[ih];W[ii];B[jh]
(;W[kh];B[jf];W[ke];B[je]C[J: This move actually does very little. It doesn't connect your own stones or splits white's stones. And it doesn't make or prevent any territory either.]

;W[im];B[kn];W[lm];B[in];W[jo];B[ln]C[J: Whites center is pretty much ruined.]
;W[ag]
(;B[ah]C[This one of the HUGE mistakes I am ashamed of.

J: We all played moves like this as beginners. Don't worry too much about mistakes like this. Just learn from it and don't repeat it.]
;W[bh];B[af];W[ai];B[bi];W[ag];B[aj];W[cg];B[ah];W[ae];B[ci]
;W[ch];B[dh]C[J: You can't cut of this stone. And you won't gain anything by trying.

White is threathening to cut of some of your stones by playing at F13. By playing E13 you prevent that and at the same time threathen to capture E12]
;W[dg];B[di];W[eg];B[fg]C[J: Now you are forced to defend in gote :(]
;W[ck];B[ei];W[ai]
(;B[bj]C[J: You should have played B9. It protects the cut too but has much better eyeshape.]
;W[dk];B[ej];W[bk];B[ak];W[fe]
(;B[bl]C[I think I achieved Seki, but :
wasn't there a way for white to kill black, or for black to live with territory?
Was the B8 move truly useful ? I think it may have been unecessary.

J: It's not Seki yet. You can play D10 while the top part of your group has liberties left. 

But B8 isn't the right move. It does ensure life but there is a much more profitable way to do so! Take a look at the varation.]
;W[mr];B[nr];W[lr];B[lp];W[kp];B[md];W[mc];B[kd]C[This move enables me to kill both whites groups on the center, but I do not believe I played the follow up as it should have been.

J: Good move!];W[id];B[nd]C[J: This looks like a good solid follow up.]
;W[ff]C[Was giving up the three stones the right choice ?

J: Yes it was since you got 11 stones in return.];B[gg];W[gh]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[rb];W[ra];B[sb];W[pc];B[rd]C[J: Should have been at R16.]
;W[od];B[oe];W[ld];B[le];W[pe]C[J: With S16 at R16 this would be no problem to handle.]
;B[oc]C[J: White should fight the ko.];W[og];B[mg];W[lf];B[me]
C[J: Better to caputer at M17. It's more points and secures a connection.]
;W[od];B[qd];W[pf];B[li]C[J: Not neccessary. Better to defend at R13.]
;W[nk];B[oj];W[nj];B[ni];W[oc];B[jc];W[kb];B[jb];W[ib];B[ic]

C[After this exchange on the upper side I thought I had kill white's upper right group. But if I had better played the next part, was it possible for me to kill it ?

J: The white top group indeed only has 1 eye now. K19 isn't even necessary since white filled the only potential second eye he had left.  But your own groups aren't completly safe.]
;W[pa]C[J: White just wasted a move.];B[ko]C[J: R13 now would have finished of the game. Since you are leading  it's not a bad idea to play a move like that just to make sure nothing is going to happen.]
;W[io];B[ns];W[ms];B[lq];W[qg]C[J: Now white beats you too it.]
;B[kr]C[J: The top right is a lot more urgent!];W[jr];B[ls]
;W[js]
(;B[qe]C[J: This move doesn't look right to me. S14 looks better.]
;W[rg];B[qi];W[se]C[i did not see that move at all ! I was fearing the invasion on the right side, hence R11. No doubt that was what white wanted.]
;B[sa];W[nb];B[na];W[rc];B[sc];W[sd];B[qa];W[rf];B[oa];W[ra]

(;B[re]C[This one is a wrong click, I wanted to play at S12, but was looking this group with the mouse over it, bad habit I guess. There was no Ko threat big enought for me to win back the semeai, was it ?

J: I can't find anyway to save your group after T15. However even if you can't win the ko you can still get points from it! 

S12 isn't such a big play. If white plays first it'll only be a small dent in your territory. If you make a ko threath worth more then that but less then the value of the ko you still get points. Look at the varation.]

J: That's the end of the game. Here is some overall advice based on this game.

First of all you should try to get better idea of how and when to invade or reduce moyos. Just experiment with it in your games. Here are some pages with information to get you started.

http://senseis.xmp.net/?ThreeSpaceExtensionInvasions

http://senseis.xmp.net/?VariousMoyos

Secondly you should learn to make a defensive move every now and then. It's normally more easy to find a sequence to capture something of your opponent then to notice sequences that your opponent can play. Especially when you're leading by a big margin it can't hurt to make a defensive move to avoid complications.

And finally you should do lots of tsumego. Even though it looks like your life and death skill is quite allright for your level it can't hurt to improve. Take a look at www.goproblems.com]
