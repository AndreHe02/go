C[Hi, I'm Michael and here is a review.
Black has won by a huge amount of points(25.5) and performed good in the middlegame and endgame. I suggest you to play stronger opponents so that it will be more interesting and challenging. If you have additional questions, feel free to ask me by e-mail.]
;B[gf]C[OK, the most popular first moves are 3-4 and 4-4. For 9x9 board, 5-5 is good too.]
;W[de];B[eg]C[It's corner enclosure. The corner is(almost sure) is yours. Not a mistake, but it's better to play top-right corner. For example, F7.]
;W[cf];B[ee]C[Top-right corner is open and white can play F7 or G7. So F7 or F6 is better.]
;W[df];B[ef];W[dg];B[dh]C[Upper side is still open and it's better to try to capture a part of it.]
;W[ch];B[ei];W[ci]C[For a white it is a last chance to invide upper right corner(G7)]
;B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[dc];B[ed];W[eb];B[fb];W[fa]C[Mistake];B[db]
C[Winning move. White can not actually do nothing after it.]
;W[ea];B[cc];W[cb];B[ga];W[da];B[ca];W[bc];B[bb];W[bd];B[gc]
C[No need. I think it's impossible for white to invide and live here.]
