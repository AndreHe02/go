C[Hello, David! 

I'm Bernd Sambale, HonFu here in the ladder and on KGS. You are especially interested in the handling of sente and aji, which is something I still have to acquire myself for a large part. Still I analyzed what I could and I hope it will be of some use. Since you won easily, something must have gone wrong on your opponent's side. This will be the main topic of the review - white could have made the game much harder for you!]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[kc];W[cf];B[fd];W[oc]C[B.: This is too early. Before white enters there, he should approach from the side. At least that's what they tell us. And the unsettled stone at c6 is a good target. Sente is nice, but don't leave weak groups behind in the opening. Generally, one should try to get out of a local struggle in sente, but if it's not possible without leaving a serious weakness, better guard and take gote.]
;B[od]C[Maybe black 9 would be better at Q17 because of the stone at L17.

B.: I Also think so. Building thickness without a black stone around R10 or 11 doesn't make much sense. Better attack the stone at P17 and make territory on the right - the usual plan.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[pd];B[pe];W[nd]
(;B[pf]C[Too passive?

B.: Well, this move looks quite unusual to me. White feels the urge to capture that stone, before black connects, so black can strengthen L17. But allowing a white ponnuki takes the pressure off the white stones and ends the attack for the rest of the game, as we will see. Furthermore if black still connected, he would have an empty triangle.]
;W[oe];B[ke]C[B.: Since white is strong, blacks move is not sente.]
;W[qj];B[qh]C[B.: This is not urgent, the black stones are alive. Now white could take a large point, maybe counter-chinese at L3, and leave R10 for now.]
;W[pm];B[fq]C[B.: Maybe O3 is better to prevent a double wing formation.]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[dj];B[ef];W[cc]C[Is the sequence from 28 up to 43 better for white or black?

B.: I would let him connect and press him low.]
(;B[cd];W[bc];B[bd];W[eb];B[ch];W[cj];B[dh];W[gc];B[gd];W[hc]
;B[id];W[hd];B[he];W[ic];B[jd]C[B.: Well, this is a kind of exchange. Black got about 15 points on the left but lost more at the top. This could be good if white had weak groups, but what use will the black thickness have? White just has to be sure to spoil the black influence. Instead he will help you to a huge center territory.

Thickness is not easy to use for us kyu-players. Do you know Takemiya Masaki? He really relies a lot on moyos. To me influence strategy often seems like a gamble. Will you be able to turn enough of your moyo into territory? Will you get a weak group to attack with your weakness? Or will all the effort be wasted in the end and your opponent has all the cheap territory?

Anyway, moyos get reduced, or should get reduced, if the opponent does it right. Here white allows you to make too much use of your thickness, which doesn't look very useful right now.]
;W[of]C[B.: I think this is not good. White doesn't need this move. Black could take sente.]
;B[oh];W[mf];B[mq];W[oq];B[mo]C[B.: Now it's time to press that moyo down there low. The left side and the bottom are two competing moyos. Well, rather territory than moyo, but still both of you should take the first opportunity to cross the diagonal to get the advantage there.]

(;W[oj];B[fn]C[B.: White allowed black another extension to the center, and now it will be harder to reduce effectively.]
;W[em];B[fm];W[el];B[fl];W[mm];B[ln]
(;W[lm];B[km];W[mn]C[B.: Only helps black solidify. Hane instead!]
;B[kn];W[no];B[ek];W[dk];B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[fk]
(;B[gk]C[Ends in gote for black...

B.: But black earned about 30 points in those border struggles, while white has got just about 10, so he gladly takes gote. White made settling center territory far too easy for black with all his attaching.]
;W[lj]C[Maybe better at M10?

B.: Blacks move at M10? What a meaning would the former wall building moves on the left center side have? Black will have lots of territory here, letting white spoil it by leaving a hole will render his former strategy useless and even endanger black's position.]
;B[jj]C[B.: Good, you get enough there.];W[kh]C[Sequence from 72 to 75 doesn't seem to do much for white becuase his upper right group already has good eye shape.

B.: Well, they are reducing moves and as such not really bad. Problem: Black already has too much territory. Furthermore endgame moves on the side are usually bigger. B11 followed by A14 for example, or O2, C2, S11.]
;B[jh];W[kg];B[jg];W[ki]C[B.: This is overly defensive. White should take sente and take one of the large endgame moves!]
;B[dc]C[B.: Now black takes the initiative.];W[db];B[np];W[oo]
;B[op]C[B.: This move only takes away your own liberties, giving white an atari for later. If continuing here, better O2.]
;W[pp];B[pi];W[pj];B[bi];W[bj];B[ac]C[B.: Black has taken both sente points here and spoiled whites profitable sequence.]
;W[bb];B[mh]C[B.: The edge is usually more profitable.];W[kf]
C[B.: White shouldn't bother connecting living groups. He'd rather play a large endgame move to strengthen the "weak" group while making some profit.]
;B[jf];W[nq];B[mp];W[ji];B[ii];W[jk];B[jl];W[kk];B[ik];W[cr]
;B[qb];W[pb]C[B.: This doesn't get white much, because black can still come from the other side.]
;B[mc]C[B.: White has to break his habit of answering every endgame move. If your opponent plays a large endgame point, ask yourself: will that group die, if I tenuki? And if you conclude, that it will not die, take a similar endgame point which threatens the same to your opponent. You did very well, keeping the initiative all the time.]
;W[nb]C[B.: This move for example: What meaning does it have? Reducing? Black hasn't got any territory here. Defence? Whites group is connected to the bottom right. There are still so many large points left, e.g. S11, E2, N2.]

;W[bl];B[nr];W[or];B[mr];W[pr]C[B.: Strange, after all this passive playing taking gote voluntarily, where he could have sente! He had better looked for a sente point of his own, e.g. R19 or F1!]

White should have neutralized your center influence and reduced your bottom territory. Instead he just forced you to make a large territory there. Still, if he had played a good endgame, he even might have won, as far as I can see. But he lost many many points giving you all the large endgame moves.

David, I'd say your opponent made a lot more mistakes handling sente and aji. If your good playing was rather intuitional, you can now probably see the game clearer and play equally strong in other endgames, should your intuition fail you. If you want to find out more about sente and gote relationships, you should read a good endgame book, for example that one from the Elementary Go Series. The principles of sente and gote can often also be applied in opening or middle game sequences. Furthermore learning to count endgame moves to know which is bigger, is generally a good idea.]
