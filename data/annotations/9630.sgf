C[Hi, I'm Ema and in this game I played with White.
My comments throughout the game will begin with "E.".

This is an even game I played with a player that's 5 stones stronger than me. I think I had also the chance to win at a certain point, but I lost it and don't know how it happened.

I'm asking for a review to understand if I really had a chance to win, and, if that's the case, to identify the causes that lead to my loss.

Many thanks to the reviewer! :D

Hello ema! My name is Simon (Ethelor, KGS 6k) and I'll be doing a review today.

If you have any questions for afterward then please do not be afraid to contact me at my email simon@thornewill.org

Let's get started :)];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[op]C[E.: just wanted to play actively.

I just want to get something out of the way before we get too deeply into it.

While P4 shows a certain amount of Kiai from white but if black is indeed 5 stones stronger than you then white will want to play a straight forward game instead of one where you'll have to fight to get ahead.

If white wishes to play P4 then that is fine. However, he/she has to awknowledge that the game will have to become complicated because he/she will be behind as soon as black takes the open corner.

Seeing that black opponent is 5 stones stronger he/she will have much stroger reading ability and direction than white does. I would way the P4 strategy is unwise if white *really* wants to win. :P

In addition to this, white's strategy in this game is one of influence, whis is also not reccomended for use against a stronger player. A better strategy would be to take sure points in territory.

It's natural that white ends up with some sort of framework but moves like P4 and the joseki which follow invest a lot in influence with nothing much to fall back on if black outplays white. Once again, unwise strategy considering your opponent.

That being said, strictly speaking this is playable and if you were playing an even game with someone of the same strength then I could not discourse this sort of play. It's just the context which makes it overly risky.]

(;W[qq]C[S.

Why do you play this move? Q8 is a large move for both sides, I'm not sure if playing R3 is worth it.]

(;B[rq];W[pp]
(;B[qr];W[qo];B[pq];W[ro]C[S.

This is a bad result for black I think. Maybe he takes back the corner but he doesnt want to have to take care of weak stones like R7 this early in the game.]
;B[ql]
(;W[pk]C[S.

Here you push black's group down, making him stronger in return for more influence.

Like I said before, not the best strategy];B[pl];W[ol];B[qk]
;W[pj];B[qj];W[pi];B[qh]
(;W[og]C[S.

This move is a bit slow IMO, just gives black sente.];B[jd]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[jp]C[E.: as I review, I think the last few moves aren't a good sequence. Black can simply slide under my stones from his corner ponnuki and eat all my territory, so the lower side doesn't have much potential.

S.

No, this is fine.];B[oq];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq];B[mr];W[lq];B[hq]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[gq];B[ip];W[ho];B[io]
(;W[gn]C[S.

Youre too worried about your own groups.

Black has weakness which white ignored.];B[jq]C[S.

Black is allowed to fix his shape

This is a disaster now for white because even if black is not connected to N2 directly and white can cut him off black can just turn and harass G3

Since black is out at the moment G3 stones are weaker]

Not sure why black plays this move. Seems slow to me]
(;W[gc]C[S.

White is thinking too hard];B[df]LB[db:A][cc:B]C[S.

This move doesn't really protect the corner. It's really a bit thin. I would attempt playing at A or B

The thing about probes it that it depends how black responds, try them out in some of your games :)]

(;W[ge];B[nd]C[S.

Black is still playing rather thin, just play solidly and poke him from a stronger position

Though its difficult for white to reply because black is on both sides. The O13 stone from earlier isnt really helping]

(;W[ld]C[S.

This is really aggressive.];B[lc];W[md];B[mc];W[nc];B[kd];W[ne]
;B[od];W[oc];B[me];W[oe];B[le];W[nd];B[kf]
(;W[gg]C[S.

Just jumping like this is a bit idle

Note as well that H5 isn't safe yet either.

Theres a lot of cut points around K6]
(;B[fd]
(;W[ee]C[S.

White isnt really in a position to counter attack like this. Black will just push through and profit]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[hd];W[di]C[S.

C11 doesnt do much o help settle whites weak groups. Black can just split and have fun playing with two weak groups.]

(;B[dh];W[eh];B[eg];W[fh];B[de]
(;W[kh];B[fk];W[hj]C[S.

Your plays here and at L12 are far too thin!

Theres so much aji that black can take advantage of];B[hk];W[ik]

(;B[rl];W[sm];B[sk];W[sn];B[km];W[kl];B[ln];W[mm];B[hf];W[gf]
;B[hg]C[S.

Here white's position is just falling apart. Not that it was ever really in tact. :/

Whites only points are in the center with roughly20 points... and maybe 11 in the corner. He's very behind.

Black has poins to match just in the top area.
___

In overview:

I think in this game white suffers a lot from just simply trying too hard. White never tried to build any territory and invested eerything in influence while black got his profits here and there.

Pressing down on the weak group instead of pincering it made it safe too quickly white couldnt really profit.

Everything really went wrong during that cut which white missed around J4 everything really started to fall apart from there.

Afterward when white got weak groups he didnt spend the proper moves to settle everything which didnt help his position either. Plaiyng light moves with lots of aji make things look safer than they really were.

My advice would be to not play so "actively" because in doing so white tried far too hard.

I'll end the review here but I just want to restate that you can ask me any questions you have. :) I hope this review was helpful for you.

Did I really had any chance to win? I have doubts about it, after this review... anyway, I'd like to hear a stronger player's opinion. :)

Advices and suggestions will be welcome.

Again thanks for the review.])

I would rather make an extension or something now

I would prefer a move like this and stop black from making a base. Having a weak group so early in the game is costly for black]

White can make nice profit though he/she will have to take care of Q5, which is not completely settled.]

Is this a problem?];B[qj];W[rk];B[rj];W[rl]C[S.

So black needs to respond and now white needs to do something to secure Q5 group.]

(;B[rp]LB[pl:1][gq:2]TR[pq]C[S.

Theres nothing wrong with a move like this for black.

White still has to defend here sooner or later at triangle.

If white defends then black can play 1, this is a powerful move as I stated before.

Later in the game black can counter white's influence with 2]

Whats more is tha black can play here. This is painful for white because his potential on the bottom to make a moyo while not completely compromised is severely diminished.]
