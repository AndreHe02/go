C[Review requested for: White (Googol [6k\])

Googol:
See my questions during the course of the game, but I always thought it is the reviewer who knows best what to point out. Thank you.]

;B[ce];W[de]LB[df:A]C[>probably ok, you can get influence on top to work with q16, black should play d14 next]
;B[cd];W[dd]C[>looks bad for black, white becomes strong];B[cg]
C[Googol: I never studied joseki, so I always play by intuition at moments like this.

>> never seen this sequence but d14 seems like a shape point.]

you allow black to play good move, and you end in gote];B[df]

J4 is high, 
you don't (and can't) want to make a big territory here. 
Right side is much bigger.


you want something on the right so you can do h13 later to put pressure on black]
;B[lq]C[Googol: A tough moment. Should I jump out or do what I did--

yes a bit

your aim  maybe to prepare to put pressure on both marks black groups.]
;B[rr]TR[hg][mj][nj][lk][mk][nk][ll]C[>do h13 now probably 
or start put pressure on black around the marked area];W[jq]
C[Googol: This slow too?

maybe but it's quite safe for white.
but the hot area is on the right.];B[qh];W[oj];B[qe]C[Googol: From what direction should I block 53?

R16 because
1. white gets corner 
2. black r15, r12 not yet alive];W[pe];B[qd]C[now black is alive

and no territory for white so far];W[qc];B[pf];W[of];B[pg];W[pm]

no comment

you don't seem to have a plan when you play and you need to visualize the end result before playing a sequence. (I'm talking about earlier in the game)]
