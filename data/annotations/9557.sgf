AB[pd][dp]C[This was a timed ratings tournament played on 9/7/14. I'm playing black at 11k and my opponent is 9k.  Black wins by 1.5 points.  I feel like I botched a number of joseki and was playing catchup the whole time.  Any strategic advice and variations showing stronger play would be welcomed. Thank you for your review.

This is   reviewed by Martin Osthaus 5kyu]PL[W];W[pp];B[cd]
;W[ed];B[ec]C[Black plays this joseki for a very secure position and cash in the corner, which is okay in a handicapgame. 
Any pincer-move is considered to be stronger, because it allows white not to build a base so easy - but it leads to more fighting and white likes to provoke mistakes in the fuseki.]
;W[fc];B[dc];W[gd]
(;B[de]C[I wanted to emphasize the left side.

black 8 is not joseki and seems to small or not powerful enough in this early stage of the game.
To emphasize the left side, the usual move at c 14 is better, because a white move on the left is easily to attack by black if there is a stone on the third line.]

(;W[kc]C[Because of the attack at J 17, black could play on the right side as well.  Q10 or R10 are giving more balance for the whole board. Locally seen, black should not allow white to play once more around the upper right corner, if he wants to attack the wide extension white L17. His upper right corner needs strength for that and white O17 is too good for white.]

(;B[cj]C[C 10 corresponds good with the high stone on D15, but the other way round it looks even better: With black C14 he can now play D10 for better development and to let alone the upper right corner is maybe possible.]
;W[qf]C[First thought with to white stones around is to defend, which means to build a base, than later to look for J14. For that, O17 is an opportunity.]
;B[pf]C[I chose this joseki because White's extension on the top side is thin and I wanted to develop thickness pointing towards an invasion in the future. As long as L17 can extend towards the right corner,  separating F17 from L17 is not so severe.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[rd]C[Not sure how to respond here.

This is an overplay and not joseki like S15.
But it is beyond my strength to tell the proper answer, because w S16 can´t be captured instantly.]

(;B[qe];W[rf];B[re];W[se]
(;B[qc];W[qd];B[pe];W[rc];B[nc]C[this result is not as good as the one shown in the variation after move 16. Black O17 puts not enough pressure on L17, R18 is later too good for white.]
;W[og]
(;B[qn]C[Can't allow white's large potential here.

Because of  whites weakness at R13, black should play closer to to the white position. Whites extension along the right side is better, when black mote towards the lower right corner.]
;W[ql];B[nq]C[again black changes his plans: Jumping out to P6 gives a miai-solution, because white can build up territory with P8 or can play down in the corner. Black then either gets an attack for the corner or can reduce the right side.]
;W[pn]
(;B[pm]C[This was an attempt to remember an advanced joseki that I learned several months ago. I don't remember it accurately and I wind up losing the corner.

I don´t know this joseki and my tutor can´t find this pattern in a progame, so it seems to be not favourable.
Black wants to fight by playing O3, so maybe he can reduce the white position with R7 like shown after move 29 and has to go for the run with O3 later.]
;W[qm];B[po];W[on]
(;B[pq]C[R4 looks like the natural move, but to sacrifice R6 is better. P5 gives black a big corner.]
;W[oo];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[oq];B[or]C[Offering these cuttingpoints feels like beeing sheep on the slaughtertable.]
;W[qq];B[op];W[rp];B[jq]C[I decide to capitalize on the ponukki at the very least and make a double wing formation, but my purpose of denying white his side territory has backfired and now he has some  captured stones to boot.

The game is open and it depends on the settling of the weak black group on top, if the left territory for white will become to big. I prefer K4 here, aiming at reducing the center.]
;W[dm];B[cn]C[G3 is the other possibility for black.];W[cl]

;B[ds];W[cs];B[cr];W[co];B[do];W[dr]
(;B[ic];W[es]C[After the game my opponent said that my ko threat on the top side was not good. I'm still curious about that though, because my intention was to make two weak groups, which I feel like I did.

The actual result is  the reducing of safe black territory on the lower side after E1. This and the lower left corner for white  brings him in front, because he has ca.35 points on the right side. The O17-group is weak and by that the outcome for the top side is open. The splitting attack could produce four groups but no territory for both players, and thats good for white.]
;B[fr];W[dn];B[jd]C[This is gambling and trading. Usually white is better by estimating values of moves. However, K16 looks good.]
;W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[kf];W[lf];B[kg];W[lg];B[fe];W[ge];B[fd]
;W[ff];B[ee];W[fb];B[eb]C[black 82 on E 18 is very unlucky. 
H17 is the local exchange first,  cutting on G14 is always good. The danger for O17 is very big, so R18 is a way to build an eye.
K11 or something there for black is a way to cover the cut on K14.

It is difficult to say, which is the most urgent move here.]
;W[hb];B[gf]C[I probably should have descended instead.];W[fg]
;B[hf];W[ib]C[The connection is something black should neverever allow. G14 must wait for later. Think big, put away small solutions if you can.]
;B[gh];W[np]
(;B[mp]LB[mq:A]C[With black A instead of N5, black would not need to play again here.  Blacks hunting move on K6 is so big, that a calmer response here is far more elegant and could prepare to attack and taking the initiative of playing - if white is as gready as in the game and likes to capture one single stone after the other.]
;W[oq];B[cp]C[Again, this capture was intended to isolate whites left side group.]
;W[mo];B[jn]C[Its again Sheeps tactics to ask for the slaughter... you have to defend sometimes...]
;W[eo]C[white should jump out.];B[ep]LB[gk:A][gl:C][hl:B]C[white is not threatening anything, so black should not defend E3 before an attack of this point happened. Here is the enclosure necessary, after that black can reduce eye shape. This is a common way of attacking a group: First enclosure, then reducing space.
The other main reason to come from the outside first is taking profit in the left centre: A-C are good points, helping to reduce later on whites right side.]
;W[fo]C[ok, this might be one eye, but one eye is not enough. If white desperately builds it so early, black should not play E4, because E4 is not destroying this eye.]
;B[go]C[See move 96:  Black pushes white in the direction where black could take profit.  K6 is waiting already for white, so why G5 now?]
;W[gn];B[op]C[Inconsequent play is mostly a bad way of playing: A player should stick to his plans.  P4 is not theme of the game and far to small to play tenuki, if something like a whole group status has to be decided.  H7 for example takes eyeshape away as well.]
;W[no]C[Now both players have groups of undecided status.];B[lp]
C[Because of white P3 black should still play N3.];W[gk]C[but... thats blacks best point :( 
Now you can see the difference, white is playing first here where black should play instead of taking the ko.]
;B[fl]SQ[jj][jk][jl][jm]C[Black can´t cut here.  It is still better to come from the outside, because building strength is good even if white will live inside. Black can use thickness in the center to reduce whites right side.]
;W[gl];B[fk];W[im];B[in];W[hm];B[lo]LB[qb:A][ik:B][hn:C]C[As white can´t close in black on the lower side, , M5 is very small and not reducing anything of whites right side.]
;W[ln];B[kn];W[lm];B[jl];W[jm];B[km];W[il]C[I'm still not sure why white didn't just block me here

He was concerned about eyeshape, because H6 is still open.]

;W[tt]C[While I made many mistakes, I feel like my invasion of the top side allowed me to gain a large amount of territory on the left. My joseki on the bottom right corner failed terribly and I feel like the game was closer then it should have been because of that. However I retained a large territory on the bottom side and was able to push into the center a little bit. Any advice or wrong thinking on my part that needs correcting?

A maybe a bit lucky win for black, but he was fighting bravely nevertheless. Both players left alone their weak groups at move 100/101 and killing here was possible. But even attacking with the threat to kill would have given the advantage in points for both of the players.

This was my first review at all and I hope it will help you somehow. Some variations without comment will speak for themselves I think, so better you have some more to click through.
So keep on going strong and best rewards!
