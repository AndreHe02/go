AB[pd][dp]C[
[AVAVT\]: Hi and thank you for reviewing my game.
Recently my style of play is trying to fight whenever it is possible, and while fighting I try to find a weakness in the opponent's line of defend, then hit it hard to force his stones into bad shape or turn mine into good shape. But in this game I really couldn't find or use any weakness from him/her, and ended up having him/her force me into bad shape instead (like the B2 bomber in the top left :( ). So I'd really love it if you could focus on helping me find out possible weakness/aji in his shape. And please point of bad moves that I had made too ^^

Generally if you attack where you are weak and your opponent is strong, you should expect a bad results (at least, against opponents of similar strength). Having said that, go is ultimately a fighting game, and it's very important to always look for opportunities to attack. As Matthew MacFadden said (and no doubt others too), if your opponent doesn't have a weak group to attack, then you need to make one :)

This was a very even game, and it ultimately hinged around the mistake on the bottom left (as you pointed out). I didn't get the feeling that your opponent was stronger than you.]

(;B[cl]C[[AVAVT\]: I really wanted to divide the approaching stone and the 3 weak stones above with this move, but s/he managed to come out beautifully and forced me to live inside instead >.<

There's something to what you say, but you're also playing into a pincer, so its a questionable choice. I don't think white will get all that much here if you play a normal answer. But I can't say it's wrong, as white has definite weaknesses in the middle and top.]

(;B[go]C[Since you're concerned with shape, here is a particular example of bad shape. This is a rather vulgar way to play, and from a shape point of view, leaves you short of liberties and rather cramped. See the variation for the preferred way to cut. Here, although you won some points on the bottom, it really hurts your central group.]

;W[qf];B[pf];W[qe];B[pe]C[[AVAVT\]: Was this move bad? I think it's a little submissive but I couldn't find a better move.

There is no other move. There's no reason to expect to dominate the white stones here. It was a normal approach move, and this way of playing is joseki.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[rc]C[This is not joseki. I'm not sure of the best play, but I expect its R13. You'll have to ask someone stronger than me, tho :)

Some variations are shown, but it's quite complicated.]

3-3 is the way to go, given the current territorial situation. This shape is ghastly. N6 or O6 are probably better shape, but white can play S6 anytime.]
