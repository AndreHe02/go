C[Hi,

This is a very hard game to review.

Your opponent is definitely stronger than you are (or maybe he was in "the zone" and you were in a slump during this match).

I tried to give constructive comments when I could. The thing is Black's move carry so much momentum that you are continuously forced to respond in very painful ways.

This is partly because of a bad opening. I discussed the use of pincers (this you can apply immediately in other games).

Very early on, you end up with an overconcentrated position: all your stones are at the bottom at move 20. Black has a very balanced position throughout the whole game. This is very important: at the end of the opening, you must have a balanced position (or at least if you are unbalanced, then make sure your opponent is also unbalanced).

Balance is a very deep concept in go.

There is the balance of position (stones more or less evenly spread on the board).
There is the balance of territory. 
There is the balance of influence (influence means how helpful stones to when is happening away from them).

Everything can be balanced in go and finding the proper balance is the key to getting stronger.

Focus on finding balanced moves or balanced responses.];B[pd]

[er:12]TR[pp]C[The stones from 6 to15 isn't such a nice choice of joseki for white.

When you visualize 6 (before playing it), you should be able to see this final position in your mind (because it is very common).

Black gets about the same ammount of points in the corner than white does on the bottom (in the end, o3 dies as part of a big group).

If Q4 was a white stone, then it would be a whole different story.]
;B[qn];W[pr];B[qq]
(;W[kq]TR[hq][nq][pr]C[This is a low position. This means that you won't be able to make much territory and that these stones don't project strong influence into the center.

It is also overconcentrated: there are too many white stones in the same area. The Black stones are balanced on the left and right of the board. The white stones are all at the bottom.]
;B[fc];W[id]TR[pd][pp][hq]SQ[dj]C[The best kind of pincer, is the one that is also a large scale extension at the same time.

Both pincers you played in this game weren't large scale extensions, so you end up with that feeling of being cramped on the bottom and the top.

Already, this is an uphill battle for white because black is leading in terms of territory and has a better position.

My suggestion is that you stop using pincers unless they are large scale extensions. When you feel confident you won't be overconcentrated or stuck in a low position, then you can experiment with pincers that are not large scale extensions at the same time.

-=-

This two space high pincer is usually played when White has a stone around D10.]
(;B[he]C[I actually have never seen this move, nor is it in my joseki dictionary.

I've analysed a few variations, and my impression is that this is a very strong move for black.

I have a hard time finding a move that is justifiable for white.]
;W[nc];B[hd]TR[id][he]C[This type of situation, where 1 stone touches 2 stones is to be avoided.]
(;W[ic]LB[mc:A]TR[nc][id]C[This isn't the right distance.

Early on, we learn that from 2 stones, jump 3 (at A).

Imagine the 2 stones are at K16 and K17 instead. Then you get the right distance. That means a 3 space high pincer would have been better.]
(;B[cf];W[ee];B[hc]
(;W[lc]C[Now you are overconcentrated (too many stones in a small area).]
;B[kd]C[Here, black is pressing down on you. This is a very hard position for white. Normally you would want to jump out into the center, but black will simply cap you and you will have 2 (maybe 3 weak groups) on the top of the board.

I have a feeling Black is much stronger than you are. The flow of his moves leads to natural momentum. He is in control of the game the whole time.]
;W[kc];B[ie]TR[hd][he]C[This is really painful for white.

This position for black is called the 1 thousand dollar turn. It projects influence on the entire center of the board.

Black will be very aggressive now.];W[dg];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc]

This is to be avoided at all cost. You must always try to wiggle out into the center, that way your stones continue to be useful in fights that happen elsewhere.]
