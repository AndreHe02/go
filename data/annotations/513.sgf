;B[dj];W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[cf];W[fd];B[hc]C[maybe a bit too greedy for black

but probably playable.  something

like R10 seems more natural.];W[qo]C[I have no idea why white would play

this.  Seems a very bad move to me.];B[po];W[rm];B[qr]C[Again, probably playable, but seems

to let white off too easily. I think

R7 would have been better, press white

into a low position and gain a lot of center influence.  The corner just

isn't that big and the white stones   on the left are pretty strong even

after black plays this move.];W[pq]C[White just makes his stones on the   right weaker with this.  Black should

say "thank you".];B[qp];W[qn];B[qm]C[Wrong move.  R8 was much better.

You are trying to hard to kill white

here, now if he lives he get's a better

position.  If you pressed at R8, even

if he lived it would be on the second line, a clear failure for white.]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[ro];B[rp]C[Again, black is too concerened with the

corner.  This move is small and pointless.  The black stones are strong and would be very hard to kill, attacking from the other side now and making territory seems better to me.  However, white may answer this move in which case it works out ok for black.  White should probably play somethin like R9 right now.]
;W[sn]C[White answered it, so blacks move was ok.];B[ok]C[again, letting white off too easy.  If black wants to press, q9 seems a bit better.  But personally I like R10 ... it's a pincer and an extension off the top right star point.]
;W[qf]C[Maybe a little ambitious of white, his group on the right is not alive yet.  Although think now if black had played R10 instead, he would have had a nice pincer at R12, and then a very strong atack on the right side stones.  S9 is the key point for attacking the right side stones.  It's possible to attack them now, but LET THEM LIVE to build some thickness facing whites R14 stone, then it would have no where to hide.]
;B[of]C[This seems a totally pointless move to me.  I think black is trying to make a wall facing his H17 stone, but that stone is very far away so you'd need at least one more move there.  This doesn't put that much pressure on White, it let's him off way too easy.]
;W[qi]C[Good answer for white.  This shows the weakness in blacks move.]
;B[oi]C[Again I am confused.  black seems to be trying to wall of the entire center, but it is open at the top and bottom and I don't think he can hold it.]
;W[jc];B[he];W[ef];B[je];W[mc];B[oc];W[le];B[kd];W[kc];B[ld]
;W[lc];B[md];W[jd]C[This is probably a mistake for white ... although getting sealed in in the first place is very bad.   J18 was better I think.]
;B[id];W[nd]C[Now I think black might be able to kill white, or at least make him seriously sweat. Black can play O17 now.]
;B[ke]C[Big mistake.  Black failed to read the situation out.  White had nothing there.  O17 was the correct move.]
;W[nc]C[Now white's invasion is much nicer and a real threat to the corner.  A very bad result for black.]
;B[ne]C[Maybe ok, but I don't think white could have broken out.  Strengthening the corner seems better ... keeping pressure on white group that way.  Now he will either link up with the right side, or take half the corner, if not all of it.  This can't be good for black.]
;W[od];B[qc]C[Solid connection is much better.];W[pe]C[White's maybe a bit over ambitious here.  It's ok, but I think P15 was much more threatening.]
;B[qe];W[ob];B[pc];W[re];B[rd];W[qd];B[pb];W[rc];B[qe]C[this is a HUGE mistake for black.  He had to play S18 then O18.  If white now plays T16 it is all over.]
;W[sd]C[white sees it.  black can still live if he play s18 then o18]
;B[nb]C[wrong order.  I haven't worked it out in detail, but white can probably play S18 right now and kill.  It's a bit tricky though, so maybe not, but I think so.]
;W[qd]C[safe if cowardly.  black lives with s18];B[rb];W[sb]
;B[mb]C[mistake for black.  white can maybe kill, or at least a ko with p19.]
;W[oa]C[good];B[qa]C[Now it's ko.  White plays m18 then s19.]
;W[oe]C[white is wasting a good ko threat here.];B[lb]C[s19 was the better way to live.  I'm not sure this is enough.  l18 may still make it a ko.]
;W[kb]C[good, though should have done it last move.];B[pa]C[Again, S19 lived for black.  It is now a ko if white plays s19.  Black has a local ko threat at O19, so it's a hard ko to win for white.  He should save it for later.  If black wastes a move securing life, white gets two free moves elsewhere, which is fine.  Maybe B16 or C12 for white now.]
;W[ra]C[too soon.  white is too greedy];B[sa];W[ch];B[dh];W[ra]
;B[na];W[la];B[sa];W[dg];B[sc]C[very bad for black.  He failed to judge the size of the moves accurately.]
;W[cg]C[c15 probably better ...black can live in the corner still, although C11 might be more pressing at this point.  By fighting the ko too soon, white has given black more territory in the corner.  If white had just played c12 directly and then black defend the corner, white still would have gotten his two moves, but black would have had less territory in the upper right.]
;B[eh]C[pointless.];W[fc]C[pointless.  way way way too small.  black can still get at least a ko in the corner I think.]
;B[ci]C[good];W[cd]C[see, white wasted three moves here and didn't get that much territory for it.  Now black has a chance again.  Something like L5 maybe?]
;B[go]C[good];W[hq]C[bad];B[jp]C[maybe a little too close];W[jq]
C[too submisive. black is now winning if he can secure the center]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[ko];W[jj]C[gross overplay.  black should easily kill and win the game.]
;B[hh];W[in];B[ip];W[hj];B[gl];W[hl];B[hn]C[bad, H7 better.]
;W[hm]C[white is almost alive now.];B[gm]C[bad, white probably lives now]
;W[ho];B[gn];W[io];B[hk]C[I don't understand this move. It just help white.  cutting directly at J7 was better and might have worked.  Now it's hopeless.]
;W[hp]C[white is too cowardly, black now can win again.  J7 is the only move.]
;B[im];W[jm];B[il];W[kn];B[lo]C[big big big mistake.  black is so concerened about ten points that he is going to lose 30.  Those stones are worth nothing.  preventing white from getting into the center is much more important.  You need to learn to count.  One of the most common mistakes beginners make is they don't know how or when to sacrifice stones.  White should now play L9 and black should swear to himself.]
;W[jl]C[This shows how bad and small blacks last move was.]

and then E15 and G15 are miai];B[fi];W[bf]C[why not A13?  it's sente]
;B[ge]C[good];W[fe];B[fg]C[bad, pointless.  Why does black go around the board systematically destroying all his KO threats for not reason?  This move not only accomplishes nothing, it hurts black.  F12 would have caused white to answer too, but would have been at least worth a point to black.  Black needs to learn to not make a move just because white has to answer it unless it is acutally worth a point.]
;W[ff]C[white now has a lot of nice ko threats, starting with F12.  he should say thank you to black for being so generous]
;B[fb]C[overplay, w G18.  Black could have just played G18 in sente, then F19 in sente.  This is too greedy and doesn't work.]
;W[eb]C[Of course, white could continue to be cowardly and let black get a way with his bad moves.  This is bad for black since he might start to think it was  good move.]
;B[gb];W[ei]C[VERY good, I didn't even see that one.  This is even more reason why black's move at F13 was horrible.]
;B[di];W[fh];B[fk];W[ph];B[qj]C[this one is actually ok and not an overplay.  White has to answer at s10]
;W[rj];B[qk];W[rk];B[af];W[ae];B[ag];W[bg];B[ai];W[ce];B[db]
C[why does black insist on trying to lose points?  just because these bad moves have worked before is no reason to keep trying them.  E19 was sente and worth quite a lot of points.  White can play E19]
;W[ea];B[bc];W[cb];B[mg]C[see, black just lost points in the upper left for no reason.  you will never get better at Go if your entire strategy is based on hoping your opponent makes a mistake.  It must be based on your good play, not his bad play.  If you want to get better that is.]
