C[Hello.

This is a game I played recently where I had to think carefully in several difficult situations. I'm not sure about the decisions I made so a higher ranking player's comments would be really useful.

Eventually, I lost by a couple of points after letting one of my groups get killed.

Thanks for your time.];B[dp];W[dd];B[qp];W[oq];B[qm];W[lp];B[qd]
;W[oc];B[mc]C[A pincer seemed like the best move because R16 was low and safe. Or would it have been better to play R13 or Q13, so as not to risk getting shut in?

The pincer seems normal to me.];W[oe];B[jd]C[It's safer to play on the third line.]
;W[gc]C[Wouldn't he have done better to play something like R14 here?

R14 may be better, but this is big too. However, if white playes here he should play one point further to te right. That would better undermine black's eye-space.]
;B[pf]TR[mc][jd]C[I wanted to get some territory along the side by threatening his weak group.

And prevent him from shutting you in. That's good, but you have to be careful because if white gets stronger, your marked stones may get into trouble.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[pc];B[qi];W[qc];B[ib]C[I wasn't too worried about giving up the corner, since settling my side group seemed more important.

It is indeed.];W[lc]C[This stone was a shock to me!]
(;B[md]C[This move makes things a little too simple for white. A hane looks natural. See variation.]
;W[ld];B[me];W[le];B[mf]C[I really didn't want to be running like this, making my group on K18 weaker and weaker... but I didn't seem to have any choice. What was my mistake? Did I play the pincer too close, or was my jump to K16 an overextension?

The pincer was normal. If you would have played it a little less close you would have had some more room, but white too. I think it would have been better to make a normal base on the third line. The move at K16 gave white the possibility to undermine your eye-space. You should have played the variation mentioned a few moves back.]
;W[je];B[hd]LB[of:A]C[I did think about abandoning the group and playing elsewhere, but I figured it would be a mistake to let white get too strong on the top.

I think it's better to abandon that group for now. Even if white plays another move here, the black stones still have some potential. A (P14) is very big. It connects the black stones, makes them much stronger and seals white in.]
;W[ie];B[he];W[id];B[hc];W[jc];B[of]TR[mf][me][md][mc]C[This was to connect solidly and also to create some thickness. Should this move have been earlier? Or even later?

Very good move. If white would have played here earlier the marked stones would have been eyeless and you would have to care for them]
;W[rc];B[mb]C[I wanted to connect J18, otherwise he would chase me again. I figured that was more important than the two stones on R16. Plus I get the chance of a monkey swing to Q19 in the endgame.

Connecting your weak group is too much work. It takes two moves. With two moves you could also strengthen your group so that there's no need to connect anymore.]
;W[nf];B[ng];W[qf];B[qg];W[rf];B[rg];W[re];B[ja]C[So here I connected the two groups.]
;W[jb];B[ka];W[kb];B[lb];W[ic];B[gb]TR[ic]C[I had to protect J18 somehow, but I wasn't happy to be helping him strengthen his corner.

You don't help him strengthen his corner, you weaken his corner. White made the exchange of the marked stones (which he shouldn't have done.) and now he takes gote to strengthen his corner. You spend two moves connecting your group. White spend a move capturing two black stones in the upper right and a move to strengthen his upper left corner.]
;W[ec]
(;B[lf]C[This is a little too direct to build strength or threaten white.]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[jg];B[kh]C[Here I was trying to get some territory by threatening to enclose white's group.

Good strategy, but not the right tactic. See variation a few moves back.]
;W[dg]LB[jq:B][fq:A]TR[gb]C[At this point I thought long and hard. My situation didn't look good. My black stone in the bottom left seemed to be in serious trouble. White had strong groups above and to the right.

I wasn't sure how to develop the stone, but I was thinking of the phrase "play away from thickness" and taking it to mean I shouldn't approach white's strong groups but rather strengthen my corner with e.g. C3.

But then, if I played at C3 the stone at D4 would be wasted. The hoshi point is supposed to be about developing influence. Except there was nowhere to use influence in this position!

Incidentally, is an invasion at C17 still viable in this situation?

Your stone is a bit lonely, not in trouble. Strengthening it is a good idea. C3 is not good indeed. That's more a move for a situation where you have a good framework and want to prevent the 3-3 invasion. I think it would be good to strengthen the corner with A (F3). That also prepares for B to put the white stones under pressure or an extension along the left side.
C17 is still possible because of the marked stone. See variation.]

(;B[iq]C[I was really driving myself crazy trying to decide what to do, so I played J3. I expected a white wedge at F4 or G4, which would give me an excuse to strengthen my corner stone and also run to the middle with J3, maybe creating a threat for white's stones on M4.]
;W[fq]C[Almost exactly what I expected, although lower which seemed strange because there was no chance for him to make a base.

But it does threaten the corner more and makes it more difficult to connect J3 to the corner in the future.]
;B[dq]C[So then I strengthened the corner as planned.];W[fo]
;B[io];W[jp];B[ip];W[cm]C[This seemed like an overextension by white. Maybe he should have played C10, or F7?

I Think F7, but it's a difficult decision.];B[dn];W[dm];B[en]
;W[gn];B[fm]C[So I tried to set up a splitting attack. My stones on K3 were not so strong, but I hoped to use the threat against white's bottom right group while running to the centre.]
;W[hm];B[jm];W[im];B[jn];W[ln];B[ll];W[ek];B[gk];W[ik];B[gi]
;W[ii];B[di]C[At this point, I felt that my splitting attack had paid off.]
;W[ei];B[dh];W[eh];B[cg];W[df];B[cf];W[ce];B[dj];W[ej];B[ck]
;W[bi]C[Was there a way for white to kill me? I didn't really believe it.

Maybe. See variation a few mover further, but it's difficult.]
;B[bh];W[bk];B[bl]
(;W[bj]C[White could have tried to cut black. It might work, but it's very dangerous.]
;B[cl];W[bm];B[al]C[On the other hand, I was worried about him jumping down to the corner from B7.

That's indeed something to worry about.];W[bf];B[bg];W[dk];B[cj]
;W[be];B[bo]C[Good move.];W[am]
(;B[ai]C[I was aching to cut at D8, but that would cost me a liberty which I figured I might need in the semeai.

Very good. See variation.];W[ah];B[ag];W[aj];B[ci];W[ah];B[ak]
C[Sure enough. Good job I restrained myself!];W[dl];B[ai];W[gg]
;B[nm]LB[ip:A]TR[qp][qm]C[It seemed like the most pressing need was to secure my territory here. But maybe the keima was too greedy?

Difficult to say. White could try to cut somewhere between the marked stones and your group marked A isn't really well connected yet. One point higher would be safer, but i don't know whether it's better or not.]
;W[om];B[ol]
(;W[pm];B[pl];W[nn];B[mm];W[mn]C[Perhaps white could have got a better result by playing more lightly here? I was worried about being cut at K8 or losing my R6 stone, but luckily I realised that I could make my own threat.

I think white should have played cross-cut. See variation a few moves back.]
;B[jl];W[qn];B[rm]C[I figured the cut at J8 or Q6 were both good, but maybe J8 would have been bigger.

J8 looks bigger to me too.];W[il]C[He thought so too! ;)];B[pn]
;W[on];B[po];W[oo]
(;B[lr]C[At first I was going to play R2, but it seemed like there were too many ways for him to force me into bad shape (I'm trying to work on that aspect of my game at the moment). Anyway, it appeared that this reduction would be just as big (actually, maybe bigger?) and more threatening.

Difficult to see. R2 isn't small either. See variation.];W[pp]
;B[qo];W[jq];B[jr];W[qq];B[rq]
(;W[qr]C[White should play a little less passive. See variation.]
;B[rr]C[This seemed like a good result for me.];W[kj]C[I wish I'd played there earlier! This is the start of all my problems.

It would have been good to try to force the K10, J10 exchange earlier.]

(;B[mj]C[It's difficult to know where to block now.

Black can best block at M11. See variation.];W[li];B[mi];W[lh]
;B[lg];W[mh];B[nh];W[ne]C[So the logical thing now would be to connect on N13, but I wanted to be clever...]
;B[ki];W[lj];B[jj];W[jk]C[Suddenly I realise I've made a bad mistake. I've left an urgent cutting point while helping him build strength towards another big cutting point. It seems like I'm going to get cut one way or another, so which group has more chance of taking care of itself? I chanced that the bottom group had more space to make a base so I decided to connect with the top.


You can still connect everything. See variations.]
(;B[lk];W[kk];B[mg];W[kl];B[kq];W[kp]
(;B[lq]C[At this point, I felt like I had one eye with the option of making another on the left or the right.

See variation.];W[hr]LB[ir:A]C[But I hadn't anticipated this kikasi. At this point, I thought about accepting the cut and playing at O2 to save at least half my group. I think that's what a modest, sensible player would do. But yet again, I opted for complications. I really need to learn some humility!

Good consideration. These kind of decisions are very difficult if you can't read it out. The temptation to play A (J2) is very big, but if the whole group dies it's a big mistake. However, if it's possible to live with the whole group it gives up a lot of points unnecessary.]
;B[ir];W[mr];B[gr]C[So this was my bright idea, to try and connect to the group on D4 by attacking the F3 stone.

Good plan.];W[hq];B[gq];W[hp];B[gp];W[ho]C[At this point I realised it was hopeless.

Doesn't seem that hopeless to me. See variation]
(;B[fp];W[hs];B[gs];W[ls];B[mq]C[Why did I play this move? I think after losing a big group, I was actually in shock and denial. My play deteriorates around here. It shows how psychological maturity is an important part of Go (and how I haven't developed enough of it yet).]
;W[nr];B[gf];W[fg];B[fc];W[gl]C[Doh!];B[eb];W[db];B[ed];W[dc]
;B[ee];W[de]C[This sequence was stupid as I have left a cutting point at F16.]
;B[pa];W[oa];B[ob];W[qa];B[pb];W[qb];B[nb];W[fd]C[2nd doh!]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[hg];W[hh];B[ig];W[ih];B[jh]
(;W[if];B[hf]C[I think this sequence was actually not bad for me, especially since I got sente.

However, it's embarrassing to admit, but all this time I was indulging in some (obviously ludicrous) dream about how he might accidentally let me save my stones on G9 or even J5! I'm sure my game would improve if I could just concentrate on reality more, and less on wishful thinking.]
;W[kd]
(;B[gm];W[fl];B[eo];W[fn];B[em];W[hn]C[He gave me a free move, so I really had to make the best of it to get back in the game. This is where I started to pull myself together psychologically.]

(;W[pr];B[sf];W[rd];B[af];W[ae];B[ji];W[ij];B[ff];W[ef];B[lm]
;W[km];B[se];W[sd];B[sg]C[So at the end of this, I had made a lot of the best yose in sente.]
;W[ni];B[nj];W[oi];B[ph];W[nk];B[nl];W[qk];B[oj];W[ps];B[rs]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[bn];B[ao];W[co]C[At this point I thought, C6 or C4? C6 was risky but maybe OK. So I did a count of the board and found (or so I thought) that I was in the lead by just a couple of points, which dictated the safer play.

My counting isn't totally accurate though, and I just counted again by hand and made it B 80 vs W 85 (but that's without including prisoners or komi). So I guess the moral is: If the difference is less than 5 or 6 points, don't trust my counting!

It would be better to read it out if possible. Basing disitions on the score is good in principle, but you shouldn't give in too easily. In this situation you can cut off the white stone. See variation. Players who are behind sometimes have the strategy of letting their opponent give in in a number of places and then starting an attack somewhere to take over the lead.]

(;B[cp];W[cn];B[jf];W[ke]C[I guess he was bored or tired and didn't want to play the ko.

Now white has connected, K13 is worth only 1/2 point. White would have to spend two moves (capture and connect) to capture the black stone and safe his own. There are bigger moves on the board. O16 and D5.]
;B[jg];W[do];B[nd];W[od];B[nc];W[el];B[ep];W[an];B[bq];W[kn]
;B[sb]C[I was annoyed with myself for playing this move which even at the time I knew was a pointless waste of a point. I was just dreaming about making a seki... even though it's not possible unless he tenukis three times!]
;W[rb]C[Still, if he responds then it's no loss after all!]
;C[Pass
---> pass
---> done
{Game 36: sirouo vs spindizzy : W 89.5 B 87.0 White wins by 2.5.}

So I made a mistake in counting. I think it was because I forgot the komi.

Thanks for taking the time to look through my game.

It's a good idea to try to stop with wishful thinking. It's good to look at possibilities, but don't try something before you think it's possible.

Another thing that happened a few times in the game is that you gave up something unnecessarily. If you think again that something goes wrong, it may be a good idea to look another time to see if it really goes wrong.]
