C[Hi, I'm Ema and I played with Black in this game. My comments will be labeled with E.
Thanks to the reviewer. :)

E.: in this game I think my fuseki was kinda poor. Moreover, I lost a fight for a central group that I thought I could have managed to win instead.

J: Hello, I'm the reviewer, will mark label my comments with J]

(;B[pf]LB[lc:A]C[E.: Here I made a bad mistake. I probably should have pincered at M17 or also L17 or K17 (the last one being my favourite).

J: Yeah, I would probably have pincered at A, expecting the variation.]

(;B[qh]LB[rh:A]C[J: double hane is another idea, see variation]

(;B[pn]C[J: you could simply invade directly, see varitation]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[pm];B[om];W[on];B[ol]LB[nm:A]C[J: this seems very passive --- even purely locally A would be better]
;W[rn];B[qq]C[E.: don't know if this is the right timing to invade the corner. I wanted to use the aji of the 2 black stones at Q6 and R6.

J: yeah, maybe it's too late..];W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[rp];W[rr]
;B[oo]LB[dj:C][nn:B][oo:A]TR[pj][pk][ol][pl][om]C[E.: trying to get a more complicated fight.

J: this move is very risky, if you don't have a concrete plan: the exchange A for B greatly reduces the influence of the marked stones. Better to just play the big point at C.]
;W[nn];B[op];W[ro]LB[no:A]C[J: this is white's mistake --- should be at A, and black gets nothing]
;B[nq];W[or];B[no];W[mn];B[mo];W[qo];B[mp];W[pr];B[po]LB[ld:D]
[dj:C][po:B][jp:A]C[E.: I connected here because I thought that I could have gained something by attacking the 3 white stones.

J: This is a mistake. It is too early, and the rythm is not good --- when you exchange jumps like in the game, white gets the outside and is not really in danger, erasing your influence in the center. Meanwhile, black is not making much territory on the lower side, because of white's low stones on both sides. A better plan would be to simply extend around A to make your lower group stable. If white captures at B, you can take the big point at C, aiming to press around D next.]
;W[ln];B[kp];W[jn];B[ip];W[ho];B[io];W[in];B[hn]C[E.: here I cut because I was trying to push white stones against my wall on the right.]
;W[go];B[hm];W[jl];B[hk];W[lk];B[ml]LB[dj:B][hk:C][ml:A]C[E.: maybe here instead of N8 I should have simply attacked with J11 or something similar.

J: this seems like a bad direction: the A stone will be on a neutral point, while white will  play in an interesting area of the board. A better plan would be to take the big point at B, it coordinates well with C --- whites center group is still not settled, and will continue to be a burden.]
;W[ij];B[hj];W[ih];B[hi];W[kg];B[ni]LB[pi:A][dj:B]TR[hi][hj]
[hk][hm][hn]C[J: this move is too passive. I understand that you are worried about the cutting point at A, but actually I think that is too small to defend against at this point. Again the left side around B seems most important, mapping out territory at the same time as reinforcing your  marked stones]
;W[gl];B[hl];W[cl]C[J: finally white got to play first on the left side.]
;B[ci];W[lq];B[ko];W[ll];B[nr];W[ir];B[kr];W[hq]C[J: this seems quite small for white, I would have tried to invade the upper left somewhere.]
;B[jq]LB[cd:A]C[J: this seems like a mistake --- I can't see a way for white to kill if black plays elsewhere. If this is true, then this is a small premature endgame move, and black should have played some big move, e.g. A.]
;W[gg];B[fi];W[ii]
(;B[dg]LB[cd:A]C[J: maybe A is still better to protect the corner. I don't think that black's center group can be killed.(see variation for one lame attempt)]
;W[cd];B[cc];W[de];B[ed];W[ef];B[df]C[E.: here I think it's a key point in my game. I decided to defend my top left territory, because I thought that I could simply connect my center stones to it. Instead, my stones were cut off and I lost the whole group and the game.

My questions are:
1) given my decision to protect the upper left, was there a way to save my center group? Did I miss some tacticts/key moves?
2) was that decision bad, in the beginning? Should I have let white ruin that territory to strenghten my center group?

J: I agree with the strategy, and I don't think that the center group should die!]
;W[ee];B[ce];W[eh]
(;B[dh]C[J: This is an important point: white's cut at A seems severe, so black should try to make some exchange first on the left side, to get some extra supporting stones. See variation for some ideas.]
;W[ei];B[ej];W[fh];B[ek];W[fj]
(;B[gi]LB[fi:A][fk:B]C[J: this is a mistake! The A stone is not important, sacrifice it and try to get connected at B (see variation). The review ends here!]

;W[ck]C[E.: and here I resigned.

So, I'm looking for suggestion on my overall fuseki, and for some advices about the fight that made me lose my center group.

Again, many thanks to the reviewer (and Happy New Year!).])
(;AB[fk];W[gi];B[ck];W[gk];B[gj]C[J: at the very least, you should have a ko to connect]

(;W[dl];B[dh];W[ei];B[ej];W[fh]LB[fh:C][fj:D][ck:A][cl:B]C[J: after the exchange A for B, if white plays C like in the game, black can connect with D]
