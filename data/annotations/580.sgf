C[reid: This doesn't seem like a very good result for white.  The direction
of black's wall is towards black's d-10 stone, so he can't really expect to
much territory for it.  Also, he can't expect much on the bottom side since
it's undercut on both sides.];B[dl]LB[dm:A]C[reid: Hmm, this is asking for a bit much.  Of course, if white answers at a (d7),
black will be happy.  Black should respect the power of the wall and play away
from it.];W[ck];B[fp]C[reid: This move is not really related to the d8, d10 stones.]
;W[fo]LB[dk:A]C[reid: If I were white I'd be tempted to ignore black f4 to push through
at a (d9).   black f5 wouldn't be all that damaging to the white positions
currently.];B[fl]C[reid: Again, this seems a bit too close to white's thickness.  The important
stone for black to be assisting here is d10, not d8.];W[dk]
;B[ek];W[dm]LB[ej:A]C[reid: This is both aji-keshi and small.  Black should tak the opportunity
to protect the cut at a (e10).  White should simply cut at a instead.]
;B[el]C[reid: Too small.];W[ej]C[reid: Better late than never :-)  But even better if white hasn't
made the d7-e8 exchange.];B[di];W[fj]C[reid: white gets a good splitting attack going.  Looks like black has two
heavy groups.  This could be the beginning of the end already.]
;B[bj];W[gk]C[reid: I don't think white needs to rush this attack - the f10 stones are
quite strong simply by virtue of their position as splitting attackers.
White can get some immediate profit (and maintain the splitting attack)
by squeezing black at (for example) a (c13).

Black should perhaps have considered playing at c14 instead.  If white answers in
the corner, then black can think about b10.];B[cm];W[bm];B[cn]
;W[bn];B[dn];W[en];B[em];W[gl];B[bo];W[co]LB[bp:A]C[reid: can white get away with a (b4) instead here?  Looks like
he probably can.  In any case, it looks bad for the center black
group.  This is a large loss for black.];B[bp];W[do];B[cf];W[ce]
;B[df];W[ee];B[cc];W[be];B[fc];W[fd];B[gc];W[ef];B[eg];W[fg]
;B[eh];W[hd];B[ec];W[de];B[bh]C[reid: White has taken a pretty big loss here.  Not only has
white's corner turned into black's territory, but the black
group on the left side looks secure now.

With a weak group like that so close, I would expect white
to be able to take the corner.  I think white e15 is the culprit.
White could have used this move to threaten the black side
with b15, and then he'd be able to lock it up.

White could have gotten perhaps 20 pts in the upper left corner to add
to his about 35 in the center,
Black would have 10 in the lower left corner and perhaps 5 on the left.  So
black would have to get 40 points out of his moyo.  It'd be an uphill battle  for black, I think.]
;W[qf]C[reid: but now black has his 15 (as before) plus about 10 in the
upper left, while white has only his 35 (as before) plus a couple
and sente.];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qi];B[rj];W[ri];B[qk]LB[qj:A]
[pi:B]C[reid: Why not a (r10) instead of r9?  White will probably
answer since he doesn't want to see black b (q11).];W[oi];B[gd]
;W[ge];B[he]C[reid: Yes, this could be a problem for white.]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[id];B[if];W[je];B[gg];W[fh];B[ff];W[cb];B[dc]
LB[bb:A]C[reid: Better for black to answer at a (b18)?  That way he can keep ahead
in the race for eyes in the corner.];W[bc];B[bb];W[ab];B[ba]
;W[ca];B[bd];W[aa];B[cd];W[ad];B[hb];W[ib];B[gb]LB[ga:A]C[reid: I think a (g19) would be a little better here.]
;W[fe];B[gf];W[jf];B[ih]LB[fi:A][gh:B][hh:C][gi:D][hi:E][ei:F]
[gj:G][bf:H]C[reid: This looks like it should be good shape, but it doesn't
turn out too well.  Instead, I think black should follow the
sequence starting with a  to e (f11, w g12, b h12, w g11, b h11).
White either takes at f (e11) or connects at g (g10).  Either way,
black takes a vital liberty with h (b14) and it looks like he wins
the capturing race (or at least gets a very favorable ko).]
;W[gh];B[jg]LB[hh:A]C[reid: Probably better for black to make the bamboo joint at a (h12) rather
than submit to the squeeze.];W[ig];B[hg];W[hh];B[ig];W[kg];B[kh]
;W[ii];B[jh]C[reid: This shape is so painful for black.];W[db]

;B[of]LB[le:A][ld:B][md:C]C[reid: Woops!  Not so fats there!  What about black a (m15)?
If white makes the obvious reply at b (m16), black c (n16)
puts him in a tight spot!  Looks like the whole k15 group
would probably die.

If instead of b white plays at c, black can follow him down
with b and white's still in trouble.];W[md];B[nc];W[mc];B[mb]
;W[lb];B[nb];W[kc];B[ph];W[nh];B[pi];W[oj];B[pj]C[reid: Catching the four stones on the side is not enough
compensation for losing  the center group (especially
since the upper left corner will go from seki to all white
if the center dies).

This is a risky way for black to play.];W[jj];B[kj];W[kk];B[lk]

;W[rd];B[rc];W[rg];B[sd];W[se];B[sc];W[pg];B[qh];W[pe]C[reid: This is a sneaky, double-edged move.  Very nice :-)]
;B[lq]LB[mr:A][nr:B]C[reid: This is fancy, but I think  it's better to simply slide to
a (n2) (or b (o2) if you're not sure a will work).];W[nr];B[lp]

;B[pn];W[ql]LB[om:A][rm:B][on:C][pl:D][rl:E][mr:F]C[reid: This seems to give black a chance: black a through e
(b p7, w b7, b p6, w q8, b s8). White connects at r7 and black
is ahead on liberties when he plays f (n2).];B[rm];W[pl];B[rl]
;W[pr];B[oq]LB[or:A]C[reid: Black seems to be behind on liberties, so perhaps he
should risk the ko and play at a (p2) instead.];W[or];B[mr]
;W[nq];B[qq]LB[qr:A]C[reid: Looks like black's only chance to keep ahead on liberties is
to hane at a (r2).  white will cut, but It looks like black is OK if he
extends to b (s2)];W[qr];B[rr];W[rq];B[rp];W[om];B[qs];W[ps]
;B[ns];W[rs];B[sr];W[qa];B[pa];W[ra];B[sq];W[ma]C[reid: Looks like black has about 5 liberties while white has 7 plus a ko.]
