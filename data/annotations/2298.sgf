AB[pd][dp]C[Dear players,
My name is Peter. I am only a 2k in my country (Germany). I am playing as no2k, go4fun or erazor mainly at KGS. So don't take my comments as the truth. My rating is only a little better than yours.
This was a very nice game to review. Both players did not make any big mistakes, but the big ko in the end. The opening was rather reasonable, and I could not have done better. You both will improve very fast I think. I hope my comments are a little useful. If there are any questions please contact me.

Yours Peter (no2k)];W[cc];B[pq];W[qo];B[op];W[pl];B[kq];W[cn]

(;B[cp]C[Another alternative is blocking the other side. This seems bigger because of the other black stones.]

;W[fd];B[qh];W[qj];B[oh]C[This is very early. The 3-3 point is still open. It is easier to play R16, which protects against the invasion at R14 too.]
;W[ci];B[dj]C[This helps white to build up territory.  Compare the white upper left and the black lower left, and consider how many stones have been necessary.]
;W[mh]C[D11 is a must. N14 seems to have no value.];B[md]C[Good. But this leaves the 3-3 point still open to an invasion. If white invades there, you wish to have a stone near K16. So I think a move like K16 or O17 is bigger. O17 protects against the invasion.]
;W[qc]C[Good.];B[qd];W[pc];B[rc]C[Don't be afraid about some points in the corner. Don't let white have influence in the center.]
;W[nb]C[S18 is sente. After that O18, P17 or even P16 is possible.]
;B[mb];W[od]C[Good.];B[nc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nd]C[This help only black. Q18 is easier. Followed by S18 gives white 1.5 eyes.]
;B[na];W[nf];B[ic]C[You have not time for that. Q13 is severe. If you answer at Q12, white R14 separates your stones. If black R14, white Q12 gives him much influence.]

;B[jm];W[gk];B[dg]C[Good idea for gaining strength. But this seems very difficult.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[ej];B[fi];W[cg];B[hi]C[You should first protect your too black stones with E9.]

(;W[eh]C[Ithink D9 is worth trying.];B[fh]C[Not really necessary. This helps white to protect the corner. K10 or L11 immobilizes the white stones.]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[ef];B[lf]C[Good.];W[mf];B[lg];W[nh];B[fb]C[Why stopping here now. This is dangerous. Your stones do not have definite eye space too.]
