;B[pe]C[Hello, I am a 2 kyu from kgs.  My username is bagel.  This is my first game that I have reviewed so I hope that I did a good job on it.  A few opening moves and the invasion at the left were the biggest downfalls for white.  Try working on reducing earlier so big invasions are not needed and you game will improve.  The little trick I showed you about the opening is very useful and will help you play the opening a lot better.  And also rememer invading while destroying a little area while creating area is better than invadinf and destroying a lot of area but non creating much area.]

(;W[mq]C[This move is ok but not too good.];B[qk];W[dd];B[dp]
;W[jd]LB[jc:A]TR[dd][pp]SQ[pe][dp]C[A 4th line move is good for influence.  With the starting stones on opposite siden of the board, this not a moyo game.  It is a territorial game so A would be better.]
;B[cf];W[gc]LB[cd:A][ch:B][cn:C]SQ[jd]C[This moves makes the marked stone usless.  There is already a stone over there so A, B, or C are all better moves.]
;B[pc]C[Good move.];W[mc]LB[kc:1][lc:2][mc:3][nc:4][oc:5][cg:A]
[ch:B][ci:C][cj:D][ck:E][cl:F][cm:G][cn:H][co:I]C[This is a very small move.  The top side is only 5 spaces long comared to the left side.  In the opening, try to play on the biggest sides first.  The bottom side is also bigger than the top.]
;B[ci];W[ip];B[gq];W[iq]LB[cp:A][cq:B]C[This is a small move.  I prefer an invasion at A or B before black secures the corner.]
;B[en]LB[dn:A]C[A secures the corner better. An invasion is still possible.]
;W[cc]LB[cd:A][cq:B]C[Good move but A is slightly better. An invasion at B is also a good idea.]
;B[og]LB[dh:B][ph:A]C[An overplay. A is much better.  B is a better move than the next White move.]

LB[qq:A]SQ[en][dp][gq]C[Again, this game is a territoral game, not a moyo game so A is better.  If the marked stones were white, then the move would be good.]
;B[qq];W[pq]C[White lost many points in the corner.];B[ei];W[ck]
LB[cq:A]C[A would be so much better.  This creates a weakness for white for black to attack and makes to territory.]

;W[ek]LB[cn:A]C[A would be better.];B[jn];W[ko]LB[cn:A]TR[ck]
[ek]SQ[jn]C[A would be better.  The marked black stones are preparing to attack the white stones.]
;B[ok]LB[gj:A][cn:B]C[This move is not consistant with black's plan.  A move at A or B would be much better.]
;W[cn];B[co]LB[cp:A]C[A is much more solid.];W[bo];B[bp];W[bn]
;B[nb];W[mb]SQ[ck][ek][bn][cn][bo]C[This is a very small move. The marked stones are very weak and need attention.]
;B[bd]LB[gj:A]SQ[cf][ci][ei]C[A is would attack white and strengthen blacks stones.]
