C[s> Hello, it is my pleasure to review this game for white.  My comments are marked with "s>".  There are questions from white throughout the game.  An index to my suggestions are on the next move.

In summary white was a superior fighter but sometimes extended too far, or got tunnel vision.  Consider looking for "bigger" moves when the local situation is somewhat stable.

Also look for move with good side effects.  A couple of times an attack pushed the opponent to weaken you.]
;B[pd]C[
24 > attack with distance moves, defend with contact moves.  the contact play here helps him get stronger.

44 > too small or minor a move, try pushing with some forcing moves, then play in some large areas.

58 > extend from your base rather than close contact plays

80 > cut and kill

90 > use shortage of liberties to capture group in center of board and rescue one of your dead groups.

120 > threaten to capture stones while securing.

128 > push against wall rather than surround directly, prevent dangerous sacrifices.

240 > severl moves on the upper left are not needed, while there are big opportunities around the right side.

254 > ko battle, the funnest part of go for me is the ko battle, here you can cash in all those already dead groups to push the other guy around.

274 > when you have an undercut or you have stones looking under a group try playing stones a ways in, especially when your wall extends to the edge.

280 > try sacrificing a stone or two and reducing his group to just one eye.

"pass" moves where it does little benefit to the game:
142, 144, 162, 236, 240, 246,];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]C[From here, black plays on the star points for a few turns, i make approaches. Should I be responding to the star point plays more?

s> I think your responses are good, maybe support your stones more when threatening him.  For example the O3 stone sat alone with no support for some time.]
;B[pj];W[nq];B[dj];W[nc]C[As well as whether or not I should respond to the star points, is it reasonable to make two approaches like this?

s> I think leaving O3 alone isn't so good, if  you support it then Q4 feels more attacked.]
;B[ge]C[s> This looks like a mis click.  Black is pretty much passing.]
;W[gc]C[s> good play, this is where black wanted a supporting stone.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[oc];W[ne];B[od];W[mb];B[nb];W[mc];B[na];W[ma]
C[s> This is a consistent pattern throughout the game, white makes a move that strengthens things for him, then black responds, giving white the initiative.]
;B[ob];W[nf];B[ng]LB[pf:B][og:A]C[s> contact plays force the other guy to get stronger.  attack from a distance, defend with contact.

A: game move

B: white is stronger here, so he attacks by extending to the edge, dividing Q16 from Q10.]
;W[og];B[oh];W[nh];B[mg];W[ph];B[oi]LB[mf:A][pf:B]C[s> again, I would go to the edge, support the cutting stones, attack Q16]

;W[jh]
(;B[mi]C[Why did he net the one stone, when he would have won the ladder? Error on his part, or something important?

s> looks like black became paranoid.  Maybe after that invasion with P13 he's anticipating bad things.  at the 15 kyu level the reading isn't so good yet, so immaginary bad futures may come to mind.]
;W[fj];B[mh]LB[if:B][pf:C][ih:A][jp:D]C[s> There is alot happening right now, here's what I see.

A: The move from the game, white gets out of the possible net.

B: K14 stones are a bit weak, white can take two free moves with J14 and J15, dividing K14 from G15.

C: Whites invasion on the right is hanging by a thread.  Q14 will strengthen and extend.

D: Lots of space down below, K4 will get in a star point, to follow the game pattern.]

A: put two stones in atari to give K5 more of a base.

B: capture the center group.]
(;W[kp];B[io];W[jp]C[I wasn't sure whether it would be better to take the two stones or connect here. I decided on this to make a base for the bottom. Good move?

s> I like this move, it does radiate power towards G3 area more than just L4 alone would do if you had taken with M5.]
;B[hm];W[fl];B[gm];W[fm];B[gl];W[hk];B[gk]LB[fi:C][il:A][im:B]
C[s> again, the side effects. when under attack each liberty is precious.

A: force k8 to connect with h7, reducing h10's liberties.

B: use shortage of liberties of k9 for snap back capture

C: bamboo connection gives H10 a sure escape and puts pressure on G12]

LB[hq:C][iq:B][ls:A]C[s> this move caught my eye.

A: game move to threaten to take L1 and secure O2 area as territory.

B: capture three stones, but leave strong stones close to F2 territory, ready to invade.

C: threaten to capture three stones and secure E3 territory.  I think this matches your playing style of threaten something to get stronger, then he has to respond, and you get to move to another big place.]

Also, in general when fighting with a group, reduce the outside liberties first, increases likelyhood of winning capture race or finding seki.

A: game move

B: stretch out and get some eye space

C: keep B4 out of corner, capture more quickly.]

This is where those close battles can come in handy, those groups that are dead, but if you had two moves then that dead group could live.  This is one good reason not to play out losing battles to the end, because it gives you food for ko.

A: game move threatens to capture R9 and S10

B: white gives black the choice of saving R9 ( ending the ko ) or saving N9 ( and continue the ko ).

C: not really a threat, as P16 can likely live on his own, but it does look intimidating doesn't it? :)]
