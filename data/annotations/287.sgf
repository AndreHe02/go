(;W[co]C[the simple move here for white would be to hane
on the outside instead. see variation 1.

this looks like a difficult fight for white. black
can choose to build thickness in a direction to
make k10 a good stone.];B[do];W[cp];B[cq];W[bq];B[dq];W[bn]C[it hurts to  have to abandon d6 like this :-(]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl]
(;B[en]C[white gets  very little profit out of this since
he's been pushed down so low.  But I think black
could do even better. see variation 2.];W[mp]L[ck]C[considering variation 2,  perhaps white
should play at a (c9) first.];B[qn]L[nc]C[this seems a bit  inconsistant since black has been
building such a fine center moyo.

black doesn't need to rush to play here since the corner
is stil pretty open.  perhaps black should think about
approaching at a (o17) to continue to build up his center.];W[qp]L[ql]
[rp]C[good idea!  if white can keep black weak here,
he can start a chase that he can use to reduce
black's center.

my only suggestion might be that since white would
like to aim at a r8, perhaps b (s4) instead of r4
might be a bit more aggressive.];B[pj]C[this would probably be an overplay if  white had
played s4 instead of r4.];W[qh]C[good!];B[qf]C[black wants complications  :-)]
;W[ql]C[things seem to be degenerating into an all-out brawl
here!

if I were white I think I'd want to play at a (q14).
this induces black to try to live against the edge
while white builds thickness outside to use against
q10 and r6.];B[on];W[qj]C[hmmm, this seems kind of the opposite of what
white wanted.  instead of getting  thick outside,
he's trying to live against the edge.];B[qc];W[qd];B[pc];W[rc];B[rb];W[rd]
;B[nc];W[od];B[pb]L[mc]C[wouldn't black prefer to play asomething like  a (n17) to protect this cut?  guarding against
white t18 is pretty small just now.];W[nd]C[black q18 allows white  to play this in sente.
nonetheless, perhaps white should leave o16
for later.  he runs the danger of being over-
concentrated with respect to r12.];B[mc];W[fc]L[pk]C[after black plays n17, the  top side is not
large, so f17 is not urgent right now.

instead, I would suggest going back to the earlier
plan of harrasing the p6 group.  white could
make things difficult for black by cleaning up all
his aji with a (q9).];B[ph];W[qi];B[pg];W[rf];B[pk];W[cf];B[cc]L[ee]
[fd]C[it seems to me that in this game, the center is
important for black.  i think coming out with
a (e15) or contacting at b (f16) would be more
consistant.];W[ef]L[ee]C[white a (e15) making a more complete enclosure
is more usual.];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe]C[ouch!  it is painful to have  black squirting
out between the white positions this way.
black f15 is essentially a powerful splitting
attack.];W[ic]L[ec]C[white usually expects to play at a (e17)
next, but in this case when black makes a
bamboo joint at b (d15) white has trouble
deciding which side to defend.

it is very difficult for white to succeed on
both sides in a position like this.  each play
that black makes between the two positions is
almost like being allowed to play two moves in
a row.  that is what makes a splitting attack
so powerful.];B[ec]C[now black is comfortable, and white is  hurting.];W
[fb];B[nq]C[this tesuji is possible since black played the
q12 and q9 series.  if white had gotten q9 first,
black p6 would be too weak to be able to withstand
white's response at o4.];W[mq];B[op];W[np];B[oq];W[oo];B[po]C[white is cut!   this hurts.]
;W[no];B[qr]C[
 Casper 1k*: is entering byo-yomi

at this point, white and black are pretty close
on territory, but black has *all* the power.  the
white n4 group cannot be considered strong since it
has no eyes yet.  black should have an easy game from
here.];W[rr];B[pr];W[rn];B[rq];W[qo];B[pn];W[qq];B[sr];W[rs];B[rp];W[ro]
;B[qs];W[nr];B[or];W[os]L[mr][ms][lr]C[
 DMX 1k*: is entering byo-yomi

this move only works (ko) if white can play
b (n1) after black a (n2).  in this case,
black can just extend at c (m2) and white
collapses.];B[sp];W[hq]C[yikes!  white is asking to get split here!];B[jr]
C[black obliges :-)];W[ho];B[jn];W[hm];B[jl];W[mm]C[the situation is pretty  hopless for white
now.  too many groups with uncertain life.];B[pl];W[qk];B[pi]L[mk]C[black q11 is a  bit beside the point.  capping
directly at a (n9) would be more severe.];W[lo];B[lr];W[km];B[jm];W[hk]
;B[kl]L[fq][fk][li]C[a bit slow.  a (f13) taking away white's
base, b (f9) keeping white split, or
c (m11) surrounding on a large scale would
all be bigger.];W[ll];B[kn];W[ln];B[lk];W[mk];B[lm]C[by playing close like  this, black is helping
white to make eye shape.   unfortunately for
white, even with blacks help finding eyes
in this position is nearly impossible.];W[ml];B[lj];W[ni];B[mj]L[mh]
C[again,  surrounding on a large scale at a
a (n12) is better.  black can always cut
here later if he needs to.];W[nj];B[nk];W[ok];B[nl];W[ol];B[nm];W[pm];B
[qm]C[
 Casper 1k*: has entered byo-yomi again];C[white made the same general  mistake several
times in this game:  he launched an attack
from a position of weakness instead of from
a position of strength.  h3 is a good example.
if the n2 group was already alive, then h3 would
be good.  but since n2 was not alive, black can
simply split with k2.  Then the burden is on
white, and a heavy burden it is...

white needs to have the patience to build a strong
position before attacking.  sometimes, you just have
to take gote and patch things up :-(])
(;B[ck]C[how  'bout if black keeps on pushing?]N[variation 2];W[bk];B[dj]
;W[di];B[ci];W[bj];B[ej];W[ch];B[ei];W[dh];B[en]C[black extends his thickness even more.]
))
(;W[cm]C[this way white can settle quickly.  black  probably
pulls back:]N[variation 1];B[co];W[dm];B[fp]L[lq]C[and we can expect something like  this.  black gets
a nice corner out of it, but we should expect that since
he was there first.  white should be happy if he can
make black 3 (k10) into a bad stone.  this looks like
a good start.  white has sente to make a nice approach
at a (m3) for example.]))
