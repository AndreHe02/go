In this situation, if black play B, white can shoulder hit at C to reduce the moyo.

If black play D, white can invade at E.

In fact there is no one good move which is satisfactory, so it is better for black to take corner at F and let white invade and black respond with a pincer.]

M10 is more or less connected to N7, so it won't die that easy.

There is white A, black B and white C cut here so white J15 can even be omitted...

Anyway, hope you enjoy this review. Sorry to keep you waiting.
