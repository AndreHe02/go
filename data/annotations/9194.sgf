C[Simba: Hi there, kind reviewer :) .

This is a game played between two 1ds. I play black in this game. I will start all of my comments with 'Simba', as that's my nickname.

I find it difficult often to determine whether or not I'm giving away too much thickness/influence in exchange for the territory I'm getting - any comments/advice along those lines would be excellent. In this game white had a lot of central influence but it wasn't particularly thick, so I was able to create a group inside.

Thanks in advance for the review :) .

WOG: Hey Simba,

Thanks for the game to review.  I'll preface my comments with WOG.  I tend to review for both sides and hope that that helps as well:

General comments:
- you play slow and steady... nothing wrong with that, but if all your game records look like this, then you'll want to experiment more outside of tournament games with a faster play style
- don't aji keshi!
- because your opponent played bad, maybe you mistakenly thought you did some things right that weren't really true.  It's a GREAT reason to use GTL to improve therefore!  KUDOS!]
;B[pd];W[dd]C[WOG: Open to diagonal, I like it!];B[pq]C[WOG: You prefer not to diagonal... that's fine.  Breaking the opponent's idea is part of fighting spirit]
;W[dp];B[fq];W[hq]C[WOG: Interesting choice.  I'd typically not do this in an even game with komi... Maybe an even game without komi... Small thing though]

(;B[cq]C[WOG: This way is no punishment for White.  This lets White off the hook]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[qo]C[WOG: Is this a probe?  If so, NICE!!  If not, then the joseki in the bottom left is a bit unplayed... but I like the idea of this as a probe and then respond... were the opponent probing though or just leaving?  I can't read the opponent's mind!]
;B[op]C[WOG: Old school!  Not a bad way to answer the probe (?)... miai]
;W[ql]C[WOG: White has decided that it's not a probe anymore based on the diagonal... there's still stuffs to resolve in the lower left]
;B[qp];W[qi]C[WOG: Interesting option.  Playing up at q5 is certainly more normal]

(;B[po]C[WOG: While it's a ponnuki and while it's incredibly strong, it's a bit overconcentrated, me thinks.  Don't blindy listen to the proverbs about ponnuki]

(;W[nc]C[WOG: This move almost forces Black to play a good next at r13...]

(;B[lc]C[WOG: Wha?!  If I were critical before about the White pincer at h3, I'm really critical now of this pincer for the same reason.  This is a bad move more than any other so far played IMHO]
;W[ne]C[WOG: Yes!!  Welll done!];B[qf]C[WOG: Can't even extend to r13 is painful :(]
;W[kd]C[WOG:  White moves into a slight lead];B[kc];W[jd];B[ld]
;W[le];B[jc];W[id];B[hc];W[ge]C[WOG: Perfect coordination with D16]
;B[gc]C[WOG: Slowish again, per your style];W[cl]C[WOG: Nice flow to White's moves]

(;B[cm]C[Simba: This is the first move I wasn't so sure about. I could play 37 at D6 with the aim of getting an inroad into the centre - any thoughts?

WOG: You're blaming the situation on this move and not the prior ones.  The prior moves are the reason you're in this mess, not this choice at move 37.  Did you read out D6?  If so and weighed against it, still, I think this move only helps White's cause in buffering a moyo]
;W[dl]C[WOG: Now White has something of a moyo and Black's cause was barely helped.  This move was aji keshi]
;B[cf]C[Simba: This also makes me feel 37 was wrong because now white 40 in reply to this black 39 is the ideal distance away from his two-stone wall.

WOG: Good post mortem!];W[ch];B[cc]C[Simba: Probably the mistake was the previous two moves - the joseki here did not feel right to me but I wasn't sure what other joseki to choose at this point...

WOG: General comments were up front, but again, this is a perfect example of your preference for corner, certainty, and what you're prepared to give up.  To improve your Go, loosen up!  Don't play so steady and sure.  That's obviously your preference... maybe in life too.  To balance your Go, balance your approach by being a bit more daring.]
;W[cd]C[WOG: Ouch!!!  This is awful.  You already have folks on the top there... this is very very bad.  All your stones are inside and not doing anything and White's stones are outside doing all sorts of things.  It has an effect on the board and you're giving White real territory...]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc];W[oh]C[WOG: I might have preferred for White to shore up the other side, but whatever, White has options!]
;B[me]C[WOG: Really?!  More inside play?  You might want to reduce the leviathan before eeking out more side territory.   Of course, the key is to count.  Is the moyo bigger or is this side territory bigger?]
;W[mf];B[md];W[nf]
(;B[ke]C[WOG: Wha?!  This can't work and is therefore aji keshi.  Unless you're under severe time problems, don't do this.]
;W[lf];B[he]C[WOG: Whoa?  Am I missing some tesuji here?];W[hd]
;B[fe];W[fd];B[gd];W[gf];B[ie];W[je];B[jf];W[kf];B[ic];W[ke]
;B[hg]C[WOG: Meh.  All you've done here is helped White settle White's shape.  Not good.  And, given yourself a burden right in the middle of White's nest]
;W[gg];B[jg]C[WOG: This is only good shape for Black when the White stones at G13:G15 aren't there...]
;W[hh]C[WOG: Killer];B[ih]C[WOG: White's problems are eliminated and now Black has floating stones amidst a sea of strong and secure White stones]
;W[if];B[hi];W[gh];B[jj]C[WOG: Oy!  Why not just play this first!  See tewari analysis on move 55]

(;W[hk]C[WOG: Weird play.  Force Black to play into White's strength.  Don't let Black play out.]
;B[jl]C[WOG: Black escapes and White gets next to nothing for the trouble... Serious ouch!]
;W[gi]C[WOG: WTH!  Really?!  White has all this power and leverage and White's going to gain a point, maybe, in playing like this behind the action?!  White is doing you a serious serious disservice and not punishing your bad moves.  White's letting you think that your bad moves were fine.  This is the give and take attitude that improves Go players... you punish the opponent in hopes the opponent learns from the opponent's mistakes.  Playing this way, it's just giving an extra move to the opponent to even up the game... Yikes.]
;B[jp]C[Simba: This felt about right; it extends from the ponnuki, pokes towards pulling F3 out and also is a bit of reinforcement for K8, but maybe it is asking for too much? As in, could I be in trouble now if white severely attacks the centre, and should have played a bit closer to K8?

WOG: I'm sure you maybe felt overconfident by the move at G11.  Understandable.  Is this move a little far?  Sure, but White has problems too.  On the whole I'm glad to see this move in your style of play... it should get you to the goal of improving.]
;W[qc]C[WOG: Late middle game?];B[pc];W[pb]
(;B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[nd]C[WOG: More sure route for Black?]
;W[jo]C[WOG: Seems desperate.  Is the count for White dictating desperation?]
;B[io];W[ip];B[jn]C[WOG: Aji keshi.  Don't atari if you can avoid it.  Normally doesn't help.  90% of the time in lower level matches it's a certainty that's non-helpful]
;W[ko]C[WOG: White's good here.];B[hl]C[WOG: Black's floating, this is one way to lean]
;W[gl];B[gm]
(;W[fl]C[WOG: Meh.  Seems like White is trying to keep White's territory instead of fighting the fight.  Not good.  See variation]
;B[ik]C[WOG: Ouch for White.  Yay for Black]
(;W[hj]C[WOG: WTH!!!  How many points is this?!  Half?  Really, this is a major boo boo for White.]
;B[jq]C[WOG: Amazing how one or two small dame moves can kill a game...]
;W[kn]C[WOG: Wrong direction now];B[ho]C[WOG: Double ouch for White.  Yay for Black.  Black's in control now]
;W[fr]C[WOG: Painful for White];B[gq];W[hr];B[lp]C[WOG: Yup]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[no];B[mm]C[Simba: Maybe this is premature and I should lean on the right hand side first, though I felt if I played a lean, e.g. Q8, he would just completely ignore it. Though I suppose if he does, I gain on the edge, hmm. Thoughts?

WOG: Thoughts?  Thought is that Black's in control now.  The real thoughts occurred earlier ;)  This is just icing on the cake.  Yes, lean on Q8 is one idea that'd be good too]
;W[kl]C[WOG: Good spirit];B[km];W[lm];B[jm]
(;W[mn]C[WOG: This is just a way of resigning... White has to try something now]
;B[ll];W[ln];B[ml];W[nm];B[nl];W[om];B[ol];W[pl]C[Simba: I was happy to reinforce in sente and let him connect out with the view of killing the lower left.

WOG: Yup];B[en]C[WOG: Severe!];W[gp];B[fp];W[fo];B[go]
(;W[hp]C[WOG: Can White play here and live?!];B[eo]C[WOG: White dead now.  Game over.]

C[Simba: From here it's pretty much endgame - if there are any important endgame variations I missed, please do feel free to point those out too, but this is the last of my comments. Thanks once again! :)

WOG: Nothing more to see here.  The game is LONG over at this point. :)]

(;B[jj]C[WOG: See move 77 for this start of this tewari analysis.   Question is, where will White defend now?  Now, you haven't settled White's shape and there's all sorts of potential problems for White in White's very loose wall.  Don't aji keshi! You made the wall certainly firm before playing this move on move 77.  Here at move 55, it has all sorts of legs that move 77 doesn't have.]
