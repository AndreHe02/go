C[Hi, I am Tuomas the 5 kyu from Finland. Lets see what I can get out from this game.]
;B[qc]C[lifyhaze [13k\]: hi];W[qp];B[dq];W[dd]
(;B[bd]C[Tuomas: Black should not play here at this point of the game. The idea of playing 4-4 is to get maximum amount of influence in one corner with single stone. It does not even try to take that corner. Now that black dives straight in white can force black into a fight where black is in disadvantage.

First there is a handy way to analyze the situation. Of course this is none of the traditional josekis but you can try to revert the situation back to standard joseki. Even if the stones are played in different order, if the end result matches a joseki you can be reasonably happy. The simple joseki that comes to mind is as a variation. Now lets just play that in other order. See variation.

But note that playing joseki in another order does not always work. But it is handy tool that you can use when you analyze situations.

Here I would try to gain some advantage from the unortohox approach that black took. I would try to press black down and to close him into the upper left corner. This should give black a nice wall towards two black corners. We come back to this later.]

(;W[gc]LB[cc:1]C[Tuomas: This feels too thin and slow. Black corner is wide open for example black 1. Also this does not really build any frameworks.]
;B[dg]C[Tuomas: Here black is too thin allowing white to cut through these stones.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bg];W[bf];B[af];W[cg];B[bh];W[ch];B[cc]
LB[dc:2][nd:4][bi:1][do:3]C[Tuomas: Taking the corner is big but I still consider it as a mistake because it lets white seal black in the corner and take initiative. First white plays '1' to prevent black escape towards bottom. Black is likely do play another stone to the corner to stay alive and then white can approach at '3' or '4'. 

With black sealed in the corner white could take full use of the wall in upper left. The result would be crushing to black.]
;W[cd];B[bc]C[Tuomas: Unnecessary and clumsy exchange.];W[dc]
;B[db]LB[nd:2][bi:1]C[Tuomas: Now that the upper left corner is alive playing '1' is not so tempting anymore. White should take the huge point and play '2'.]
;W[eb];B[ca]LB[nd:1]C[Tuomas: Now that the black is really really confined to the coner white must play '1'.]
;W[jd]LB[nd:1]C[Tuomas: Too little, too slow. White does not take advantage from the huge influence he has. Black can just play '1' to minimize the white framework.]
;B[fd]C[Tuomas: I would not play this because now black loses lot of options.]
;W[fc];B[ff]C[Tuomas: Capturing this kind of stones is very difficult. They have lot of space to run and black can always sacrifice few stones and rescue rest. Because white group is alive his best option is to ignore these stones. Let them be here and play on other sides of the board. Doing this will force black to constantly keep eye on these stones and consider if they are getting in danger.

Basically if white leaves stones here black can not allow white to build any kind of influence towards center. And that means black must submit to deals where white takes lot of territory while black gets influence.

And a little note: capturing these stones is not that big. Ten or perhaps twenty points. Not worth the trouble.]
;W[ee];B[fe];W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[gg];W[fh];B[kc]LB[nc:1]C[Tuomas: This is huge point but black is a little thin. White could just throw a stone at '1' and make a huge fight with black in clear disadvantage. Black would have a weak group at upper left and upper middle. White would have one weak group at upper right.]
;W[jc];B[nd]LB[nd:1][qj:2][do:4][op:3]C[Tuomas: Black takes a key point. Now if you consider the white wall in upper left corner you notice that it is not worth much more than the black upper right corner. And black took the upper left corner too so white is already at disadvantage. All this because white did not play the key point at '1'.

The remaining big points are '2', '3' and '4'.];W[nq];B[if]
;W[gf]LB[qj:1]C[Tuomas: Not worh the trouble. Play '1', it is a lot bigger. If black keeps on rescuing these while white graps the big points, white wins.]
;B[ge];W[hg];B[hf];W[gh];B[gf];W[jf];B[ig];W[hh];B[jg];W[ke]
;B[kf];W[je];B[lg];W[lf];B[kg];W[lc];B[mf];W[mc];B[nc];W[qg]
C[Tuomas: Too far. Black is starting to have central influence so playing here will leave white open to heavy attack.]
;B[qf];W[pj]C[Tuomas: Good, white took a big point and is now in clear advantage. Cgoban score estimation is W+31.5.]
;B[qk]LB[pj:1][pk:2]C[Tuomas: Unfortunately this will be very difficult to handle. Most important is to keep white '1' safe. Playing '2' is propably a good start.]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[om];B[qj]
(;W[pk];B[qh];W[ph];B[rg];W[pg];B[rm];W[rh]LB[qi:1]C[Tuomas: This idea works better if you start from '1'.]
;B[qi];W[rf];B[ri];W[sg];B[re];W[pf]LB[qe:1]C[Tuomas: Big aji-keshi. You lose good opportunities with this. Playing '1' would be better.]
;B[qe]
(;W[ol];B[pm];W[ok];B[qn];W[pi]LB[me:1]TR[fd][ff][eg]C[Tuomas: Now consider this result if the situation in upper left was not resolved. If black was not so close to connect around '1' he could not allow this kind of result. Because that upper left situation is already almost resolved black can take this kind of exchange where white gets more influece and black gains some territory.

White influence is also worthless because black already has the stones that are needed to prevent from making territory with this wall.]
;B[nh];W[pe];B[pd];W[ne]C[JenT [14k\]: 1 sec
lifyhaze [13k\]: ?
JenT [14k\]: ok
JenT [14k\]: sorry
JenT [14k\]: someone stopped by to talk];B[me]C[lifyhaze [13k\]: k]
;W[pn];B[ql];W[dj]LB[do:2][fp:1]C[Tuomas: Small, there are no territory around here. Playing aroudnd '1' would allow white to build a framework and '2' would prevent black corner enclosure.]
;B[bj];W[cl];B[fk]LB[do:1][fp:2]C[Tuomas: Black plays another stone that should be ignored. If white plays '1' he attack this and prevents corner enclosure. Another alternative is to play '2' and build the framework white attacking this.]
;W[fj]C[Tuomas: Too little, too close. Think big.];B[hj];W[kq]
LB[gq:1]C[Tuomas: Too slow, black will just play '1' and you are still even.]
;B[rp];W[qo];B[ro];W[nn]LB[on:1]C[Tuomas: Playing '1' here would reduce headache in near future.]
;B[qq];W[pp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nr];B[pr];W[op]LB[fp:1]C[Tuomas: This last defence is not necessary. Black too too large corner but even now white can get nice result by playing at '1'. He gets huge freamwork and leave black in disadvantage.]
;B[rr]C[Tuomas: Not necessary.];W[kn]C[Tuomas: Too little, too slow. Think big. Have more courage and go pick a fight.]
;B[iq]LB[gq:1]C[Tuomas: Black took a key point but white is so strong that he should take his changes and charge at '1'.]
;W[kk]C[Tuomas: How many points does this make? Ten perhaps. You know - too little, too slow. White is about 10-20 points behind.]
;B[kj];W[ip]C[Tuomas: Touching a stone like this will just make it stronger. White loses a great attack here.]
;B[lk]LB[hq:1]C[Tuomas: Uraaa! Attack with everything you got at '1'. The center is not interesting.]
;W[ll];B[kl];W[lj]LB[jk:1]TR[hj][fk]C[Tuomas: White had done this several times already. Do not let your opponent to capture this kind of stones. It gives him too good shape. Think about extending at '1' for example. That would put the marked stones in serious danger.]
;B[jk];W[mk];B[li];W[mj];B[mi];W[hq];B[lm];W[ml];B[km];W[jl]
;B[jm];W[ln];B[il]C[Tuomas: Again.];W[fq];B[cn]LB[co:1][cp:2]
C[Tuomas: Well that went nicely for white. Black shoud propably play '1' instead of this. That corner looks dangerous. Now white '2' should make quite nice mess in here. Please try out some variations and check if you can get the white '2' out from there.]
