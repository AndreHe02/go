C[Hi I played Black.

I got behind early in this game and had to fight back. I'm just looking for some basic advice.

Hello flam.

This is my first review for the GTL, but I hope I can help you to improve your game.]

(;B[cf]C[It is hard to call C14 a bad move. Black switches from moyo territory.

If you want to play a moyo game, then I would suggest H17 or D14, since it is easier to develop from that stone.]
;W[jd]
(;B[qe]TR[fc][jd][pc]C[Preventing the shimari is a good idea.

However, it is more common to aproach the marked white formation with a move at R14.]
;W[ph];B[nq]C[Tenuki does looks possible, but keep in mind what white might do now.]
(;W[lq];B[no];W[qn]
(;B[jq]C[There is no need to play out of joseki in this situation.]
;W[lo];B[nm];W[cn]TR[lq][lo]C[White has no time to take actions in the corner.

For sure he must take care of the marked stones.

Black should take the chance to attack now.]
(;B[cl]C[This is the wrong direction. Black should attack the weak group.

Locally, the attachment at C5 would be better, since it makes use of the stone at D10.

White can easily take the corner in good fashion now.];W[cq]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[bn];B[gq]C[G3 is too close to the wall. Instead of sealing white in, black should still attack the weak group.]

;B[mq];W[lp];B[kr]
(;W[km]C[White may also jump out faster, because the base is solid.]
;B[nk]
(;W[qk]C[It is propably better to help the center group.]
(;B[pr]C[This is a bad move.

Locally, white is already fine and can take sente to help the center stones.

Black also loses chance to jump to san-san directly, which would be a much better choice locally.]

White still needs a move to fix the marked shape, which is rather urgent now.

This could happen, because white reduced his own liberties.]
;W[eb];B[fd];W[mf];B[ne];W[dc]C[It is better to keep this move in reserve for endgame or as a ko threat. White reduces his own liberties again...]

The game is very close now.];W[jk];B[hj];W[of]C[It is not possible to kill the black group, but white is propably hoping for a mistake.]

I don't think you were behind early in the game. 
You just missed some chances to get a better result through attacking. Keep on your attack - especially after your opponent plays away!

You can also greatly improve in yose if you look at the whole board. Learn to estimate the values of yose moves, and learn to not save every unimportant stone. I have seen a lot of almost wasted moves. That might get you one if not even two stones in strength quickly.

Besides that, try not to play aji keshi. If you cannot tell for sure a move works, don't play it.
I am sure I don't have to explain the concept of aji keshi to you, but try to think about it more ion your games.

Hopefully I was able to help you a bit.

If there are still questions left, feel free to contact me on KGS ( Femto [2k\]) or drop me an email.]
