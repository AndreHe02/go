C[Hello!
I played Black so i want the review for Black as like, but please point out missed(or taken) great opportunities on both sides
I am mainly interested in unexploited mistakes and how to punish them.]
;B[qp];W[pd];B[dd];W[dq]C[Jet: A tasuki fuseki is one in which both players make their initial plays in diagonally opposite empty corners.]
;B[oq]C[Jet: When you have a game of opposites like this it's probably best to start some fights right away.  It's not a bad move to make a shimari, but it's probably more efficient to start the fighting.]
;W[fd]C[As I didnt want to make a shimari of my own in the upper(lower? orientation is weird-every program different) left, because I considered it too passive; I chose the one-point-jump approach against the black3 stone. Direction towards my high and fast to develop white2

[Jet: here, I became confused and thought you were playing white.  I didn't realize someone had already reviewed this game.  White's thinking is quite lucid.  I'm going to leave my original comments, but mark them "w-jet:"\]

w-Jet:  Face to face, if you're black then Q16 (or 16-16 in the old counting) is the upper right corner (lower left to white) and you should generally stick to that corner for your first move.   On the computer though, Q16 is the upper right to both players and it really doesn't matter where you start.]
;B[ef]CR[hd][dc]LB[dc:1][cc:2][ec:3][cb:4][df:D][hd:A][fq:B]
[cf:C]C[A kind of unusual response. I did expect a pincer around A or a kakari at B or a small knight on C.

w-Jet:  Yes, that's an unusual response.  I'm not very knowledgeable about joseki mistakes, but I beleive you continue (1-4) as if E14 were at c14 (modern) or d.d14 (the old standard), and his e14 will leave him bad aji later on.   So far, you don't really sound like any 23kyu I've ever played.  You seem to be thinking quite globaly, and I wouldn't be totally shocked if your fuseki was better than mine.

Jet: Now that I've remembered you're black...  E14 is probably intended to be an attack on the white stone.  It isn't a particularly strong one though.  D14 is a better attack.  the D14 attack works best with a handicap stone at K16 though.  The usual response is definitely c14.   Keep in mind though, that hoshi stones are not intended to secure corner territory.  Their influence points outward and it is generally not efficient to try to use them to build corner territory.]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[ed]TR[cb]C[w-Jet: pretty sure black e16 is better off at c18 since it would undercut your new position.  I think he's trying to use his poorly placed e14 stone.  If you look at this corner further, there's probably some nice way to punish the corner.

jet:   It is definitely better here to play c18.  It secures your side and undercuts his.  This works better when E14 is at d14 or c14.]
;W[cb];B[bc]TR[cj][dj][ck][dk]C[Now we both had strong positions, but mine where facing my white2.

so..

w-Jet: Yes, that's excellent thinking.  Actually, he went and built that nice wall and left a serious flaw in it's design.  White can almost choose at random and select a point that overconcentrates the position horribly.]
;W[ck]LB[ci:A][co:B]C[I decided to extend from my stone in the upper(lower?) left just to where I thought an extension from his corner position would be safe.
The reply on A brought the oportunity of B.

w-Jet: again, excellent thinking.];B[ci];W[co]TR[cm]SQ[dn]C[Making a shimari and giving some backup to white14


w-Jet: Yes, it's a shimari.  However, it doesn't give much support to C9 and invites c7 later.  I wonder if c5 would be better at d6?  A nice two space extension from your coner and it supports c9 a tiny bit better.  At any rate, with so much open still, it may have been better to spread out a little more.  do something really big like k4, q10, or add support to your UL corner.   Definitely a big move to secure your corner though.]
;B[qj];W[kq]C[This was made to prevent a large black double wing formation and to establish one of my own in the upper left corner.

w-Jet: Nice thinking again.  I wonder if it's too close to his thickness, but it's not absurd or anything.  And it does do what you want.]
;B[mq]SQ[kd][hc][nc][cm]TR[qf][pf]C[jet:  This is a pretty small move.  It would probably be better to attack his upper left (squares) or try to split him at c7...  Also, if you want to try a passive territory grabbing extension, why not combine it with something that resembles an attack, like the triangle points.]
;W[hq]C[I was able to play H3 ideally and peacefully.
We both got a double wing corner but mine was bigger :)

w-Jet: H3 was maybe a little low.  Grabbing territory from the 3rd line is probably smaller than you need to be.  It makes your territory more secure, but there's a trade-off in points.  It's also good to alternate between 3rd and 4th line stones when your marking out a nice moyo.]

(;B[qf]SQ[qh]C[w-Jet: here, he's building a very disconnected moyo along the right.   A hoshi stone is not very good at securing a corner.  The whole point of playing one is to get your opponent to invade your corner.  But you want to leave him small after.  Here, I would try to split up black, while at the same time developing my moyo, and further, finding a way into the center.... how?  Well, I'd cut at the natural place (square).

jet: This move would work remarkably well at Q14 (variation).  Again, you want to get up off the third line here and there.  The third line is fairly secure, but you don't earn as much.  Proverb:  The fourth line is the line of victory and the third line is the line of defeat.]

(;W[nd]C[w-Jet:  There's certianly nothing wrong with this move.  It's a touch passive though and the meek do not inherit go.]

(;B[of]LB[jd:A]C[A was an amazingly clear point to take :)

Jet: p14 doesn't do very much.  There are a number of huge points on the board, but all p14 does is let your opponent build a huge 4th line moyo.  Instead, consider going into the corner a little (variation) or possibly climb into his huge moyo before he gets to build it.]
;W[jd]
(;B[kp]TR[jp][ko]C[Jet: tuske "attacks" are usually not a good plan.  Attaching is a DEFENSIVE play.  It's counterintuative since touching seems to be the most violent thing you can do.  Instead of attaching, consider a shoulder hit or a capping play.]
;W[jp];B[ko];W[ho]
(;B[ek]TR[dj]SQ[cm]C[jet:  I see what you're up to here, but it invites white to push through the gaping hole...  A better attack might be to push white against your thickness (square).  White has numerous answers for the square, so it's best if you examine the variations on your own.  But I did start a variation so I could mark some of the alternatives.]
;W[dj];B[di];W[ej];B[ei];W[fe];B[ee]LB[qd:A][jc:B][mf:C]TR[rd]
[qc]SQ[ld]C[A is urgent. But I played B safe but slow as hell. Now I am considering C. Please look at my variations.

jet:  I'm not sure A is all that urgent... better to play s16 or try to cut up blacks right hand moyo.  If black wants a peice of that corner, he can get it at the triangle points.  But there are definitely bigger moves than white k17.  Perhaps white is afraid of black grabbing some triangle and then invading at the square.  I'm not sure b actually helps with the square invasion though.]

[na][oa][pa][qa][ra][sa]C[jet: It's not that there's anything wrong with this, it's just that it's a little small.  The marked area that you're trying to grab is only 8x3 = 24 points.  Grabbing center territory is often quite difficult too.  You can make the moyo very deep by playing N14.  White will probably answer with something like m16 and then you can try to gain the square area too, but he'll get the circles: w27 vs b36.  Black won't get to keep all 36 though, and it's generally a bad idea to gift your opponent with 4th line stones.

Either way, n10 doesn't really do enough.  I'd recommend sneaking into his corner and then trying n14.]

C[Jet: This fight could have gone a lot differently.   Please examine it starting with the f7 stone.  There are various wonderful things you can do here using the aji of the stones you're trying to "save."  I don't think you can save the stones... There are only two anyway.  But you should be able to climb into the white territory a little bit more instead of helping him build this nice moyo.]

(;B[hf]TR[fe]C[jet: This would be a fine extension, where it not for the marked stone.  Proverb:  The turning move is worth a lot.  Check the variation instead.]

(;B[oo]C[jet: again, touching is not a good attacking move.  If you want to kill that stone, surround it on a large scale.  There's really no place for him to make eyes in there if you have him totally surrounded (see variation).]
;W[lp];B[lo];W[mp];B[mo];W[lq];B[np];W[mr];B[nq];W[lr];B[nn]
C[jet: this wasn't really necessary.  There's little chance of him doing something useful in there.]

(;W[pr]LB[fc:A]C[White106 on Q2 is idiotic here. a move to A would have been correct I assume

jet: I don't think A is nearly as valuable a point as he thinks it is.  Let's check. 


The real reason q2 is odd is because a proper monkeyjump is as follows (variation)]

I cant believe that i Havent seen this...

All you have to do is play eye stealing moves and then run to your other stones.  White will die on his own in that moyo.  The only tricky part about playing black in The Moyo of Death is you have to keep your stones alive by running.


(The moyo of death is a fabulously fun variation of go where you place black stones around the entire outside of the board -- a stone at t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8... all the way around -- and white goes first.  If white can make a living group, he wins.  It is very difficult for white to live even in that large of a moyo!)]

(;B[jd]TR[lc]SQ[of]C[Jet:  Ahh, now that's nice.  And you still get to keep your side.  Actually, there's a very fun trick invasion at m17 which I have put in as a variation.  It may not get you anything, but then again, it may.  At any rate, the point is that p14 didn't do very much.]

(;W[qh];B[qc];W[pc];B[qd];W[pe];B[rf];W[og]C[Jet:  This is a josek, and I think an excellent choice.  It build on your UL corner, and his corner is quite small really.  This works a lot better of you have a stone at k16 though.  Which is why I think c5 may have been better up there.  Then, you would have had to duke it out along the left side, but, you did pick the tasuki fuseki ... so some fighting is probably required.

Just to be clear, again, without k16, this wall is dangerously close to useless.]

TR[jc][jd]C[Jet: This is the other basic joseki... It appears to push him into your nice large top moyo, but it also gives you a wall pointed at his LR corner.  I believe from here you can attack it further.  Personally, I might feel sad about pushing him up into my top side like that, but then again, you could try to secure some top by playing in the triangled area.]
