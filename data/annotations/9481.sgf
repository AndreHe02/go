C[B: Hi, I'm Bart, around 7 kyu, and I'll try to review your game. I haven't played or reviewed 13x13 in a while, so I hope I'm still able to give some useful comments.]
;B[dk];W[jd];B[cd];W[jj];B[ec]LB[hc:1][ic:2][if:3][jg:A][kg:B]
[ih:4][gk:C][hk:6][ik:5]C[B: indeed A  or B would be one idea. 6 or C is also possible. 1 and 2 are a bit small because black already has a stone at E11. And 3 and 4 leave a bit too much open space below the white stones.]
;W[hk]
(;B[fk]C[B: this seems a bit small/slow. Around D7 is still open, and if white gets L7 it has more potential than black. Playing on the other side is bigger, because there is no white stone yet.]
;W[gj];B[fj];W[if];B[gc]C[B: a bit too small. H11 is also possible.]
;W[gf]C[B: good. J11 is also big.];B[ef];W[fd];B[fc];W[ed];B[dd]

;B[bg];W[dj];B[bi];W[bj];B[ai];W[ck];B[fg]C[B: yes, I'd expected that one earlier.]
;W[gh];B[fh];W[fi]
(;B[ej]C[B: big chance for black; cut at E5. See variation.]
;W[gk]
(;B[cl]C[B: still black at E5.];W[ei]C[B: yes, that was needed.]
;B[bl]
(;W[aj]C[B: there's a interesting move at F2. See variation.]
;B[bk];W[cj];B[ak];W[di];B[eg];W[gi];B[gl];W[hl];B[gm];W[hm]
;B[el];W[ja]C[B: black can possibly live in the corner (L3), so it's also a good idea to defend there.]
;B[ia];W[ka];B[fe]C[B: or play L3 to try and live there. And there is a nasty move at L11.]
;W[ge];B[ee]
(;W[gg];B[kk]C[B: ah, there it is. I'm not sure if it will work for black, but at least white has to try to keep black small.]

(;W[jk]LB[kj:A]TR[ij][ik][il][im]SQ[kf][lf][mf][kg][lg][mg]
[kh][lh][mh][ki][li][mi]C[B: so try to defend on the side that has the most points for you. If you play K3, you defend a few points (triangles) on the left. If you play at A instead, you defend all the points towards the top (squares).]

(;W[jm]C[B: again, the other side is a little bigger.];B[km]
;W[im];B[mg];W[mf]C[B: danger! Black can play M8.]

;W[mj];B[lk];W[jk];B[il];W[ik];B[lm]C[B: black has to play, I think, or the corner is dead (ko).]
;W[im];B[kl]LB[ml:A][jm:B]C[B: now A and B are miai (if you play A, black plays B and lives, and if you play at B, black lives at A).]
