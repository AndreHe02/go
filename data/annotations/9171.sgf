C[Hello.  I'm Todd, I'm around 8 kyu (on a good day, anyway).

I've done lots of reviews for people, but this will be my first gtl review.  I hope you find the review helpful, and that you'll feel free
to ask me about anything you feel I haven't covered, or that I haven't explained properly.]

(;B[co]C[This seems deep to me.  I usually play from the other side.]
;W[cm];B[eo];W[cp]C[White touched you!  How dare he!  You should always consider being touched with bending around the stone. (hane)]

(;B[fq];W[do];B[dn];W[dp];B[en];W[cn];B[bo]C[Too small.  That stone is likely dead anyway, this is at best one move to try for some aji, but I think white could maybe even just ignore it.]

(;W[bp];B[bn];W[bm]C[This just makes white stronger, and takes away any possibility of c5 being made use of later.  Instead, black could simply tenuki.]
;B[dm]LB[fd:D][od:A][pj:B][jp:C]C[This is tiny.  Black should take a big point elsewhere instead.  A finshes an enclosure and can be followed with b if white plays elsewhere.  Even B is better right away.  C is a big point an gives the small wall to the left strength.  If you feel aggressive, you can approach at D.]
;W[an];B[cl];W[ao];B[dk];W[od]C[White gets the first tenuki here.  That means it's a chance for white to make you follow him around while white dictates the course of the game.  White has sente.]
;B[pf];W[qc];B[pc];W[pd];B[rc]C[This should not work.]
(;W[oc]C[Big mistake by white.];B[qb]C[This is a nice result though.]
;W[kd]C[White makes the proper extension from his two stones on P.]
;B[de]C[This is good, taking sente (the initiative) because your group is safe in the corner.]
;W[ce];B[cf]C[Better than the lower corner.  Attach?  Hane!]

(;W[cd]C[White is right about the proverb: Hane?  Stretch!  But he should have stretched in the other direction.]

C[Well done.];W[nn];B[nl]C[Black is winning by about 25 points or so here.  Black won the game by being stronger in close fighting, better at counting liberties in capturing races in the two groups that fell in the middle.

Hard to know what to tell someone about how to improve who won by such a margin!

In the early game, work to get the big points; try to make the necessary moves when attacked so that you can break free to grab the next big point.  Sometimes a corner blows up early in the game with a huge struggle, but it is still important, even then, to look for the right occasion to break away and make the next big move in a different part of the board.

Keep groups seperated early on, not just during big capturing races.  Divide your opponents stones when they are still far apart, and they need to work that much harder to connect later on.

I hope that helps!  Take what helps, and use it, throw the rest of what I said away.:)]

(;B[bf]C[Gotta keep 'em seperated.  It's late now, and black's original move has become correct to minimize the damage because white is already connected at the bottom, but would be simple to keep black seperated here if black had cut white from the bottom.]
