C[sw: Hello. I'd like to thank you very much in advance for taking time off of your busy schedule to help me with my game today. I really appreciate it.

I lost this game by a fairly small margin, and I'd like to know how I should improve my game.

You are reviewing for sw (Black).

Dakre: Hi, This really was a close game and things changed often in the game. Your opening was on a quite high level, but i noticed some weaknesses on reading out Life and Death and direction of play. I hope the commentary is helpful.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[cf];W[ch];B[ef]LB[cc:B][fc:A]C[Dakre: this is a joseki giving good influence to black... alternatives are the double kakari at A, or going in to the corner at B... 
I probably would have chosen A, because it works with Q16, and B probably is not so good here in this situation, but your choice is good as well]
;W[fd]
(;B[cj]TR[cf][ef]C[Dakre: this is not such a good move. You try to attack white here, but black is weak here... the lower left is white, what makes c10 weak, and the marked stones are not that strong either. See variation for the joseki]
;W[dj];B[ci];W[di]
(;B[ck]LB[bh:A]C[Dakre: connecting your stones at A here might be better]
;W[dk];B[cn]C[sw: Now, I made this move as a side extention but at the same time to launch an attack on the D4 stone. I thought C7 instead of C6 would've been pretty small since I think that it would be easier for White to make territory on the left side, which I am trying to take from him at the moment. Do you think this was a good move, or is C7 better than C6? Please explain the pros and cons of C7 as opposed to C6 if there are any.

Dakre: This move is ok, because white has a weakness at d12. you have to read that carefully... it can happen that three stones are too low on liberties to play this and that c8 becomes a danger. But it is not in this case.]
;W[cl];B[bl];W[bk];B[cm];W[dl];B[bj];W[nq]
(;B[oq]C[Dakre: This is a clearly bad move because you strengthen white and white gets good influence on the lower side while you strengthen the corner, but in gote.
If you want to do that, then A is a better choice, because it ends in sente, otherwhise O3 becomes under attack]
;W[np];B[op];W[hq];B[kq]LB[pj:A]TR[qk][ql][qm]C[sw: White's bottom side looks very big, so I was trying to take some of that territory away from him. Was this a good idea? What move would've been better?

Dakre: This invasion is a bit too early for my taste. The lower side is not too big yet, the lower left corner is still open and the right side is much biger at the moment. This is because it perfectly works with your shimari in the lower right... the marked area in front of the shimari is valuable for both. So I'd probably play somewhere around A.]
;W[kp];B[jp];W[jq]
(;B[iq];W[jr];B[ip];W[ir];B[ko]C[sw: Here it seemed impossible to reduce White's territory on the bottom any further, so I was aiming for influence with L5.]
;W[lp];B[jn];W[hp];B[in]LB[mn:A]C[Dakre: this is overconcentrated shape. Your stones can not be captured, and j6 does not form an eye, white still can play j5. A play at A would have been better to strengthen that group.]
;W[qj]C[Dakre: white takes the big point on the right side]
;B[qh]LB[ql:A]C[Dakre: I think, this is the wrong direction. The area in front of the black shimari is still worth something, so probably it would have been better to play at A, which indirectly strengthens your middle group as well.]
;W[qm];B[jc]C[Dakre: good move, last big point on the board, probably you could even have played J17.]
;W[qc]C[Dakre: this is too early and is good for black.];B[pc]
;W[qd]
(;B[pe]C[Dakre: see the variation for the joseki, black can keep white smaller in the corner]
;W[qe];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg]LB[pf:A]C[Dakre: be aware of the danger of the cut at A!!]
;W[re];B[of]C[Dakre: bad shape, better connect solidly. White has a double peep at q13.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[gc];W[nc];B[oc];W[nb];B[pa];W[qa];B[oa]
;W[kb];B[sf];W[sd];B[rc];W[rb]
(;B[md]C[Dakre: very important to block at k18 at first!!
This is to strengthen your own group while attacking the white... you will be able to make a valuable attack on the L18 group or the F16 group, because white did ignore your play at G17.
Even with just K18 your prospects to kill are not bad.];W[jb]

(;B[ib]C[Dakre: extend at J17!];W[ic]
(;B[hc];W[id]C[Dakre: bad shape. better just play h18.];B[hb]
;W[kd];B[je];W[jd];B[ge]C[Dakre: very good move];W[gd];B[hd]
;W[he];B[fe];W[fc];B[ie];W[hf];B[fb];W[eb];B[ga];W[ia]C[Dakre: whites mistake. One should read in these situations and white better should not try to kill by hard while guessing... only if you know for sure... white is risking to much. You played well here...]
;B[ec];W[ed];B[dc];W[db];B[cc];W[ja];B[ha];W[cb];B[cd];W[fa]
;B[ea];W[da];B[de];W[fa];B[ee]C[Dakre: almost game over now. I think, black has a lead of about 25 points here.]
;W[bc]
(;B[bd]C[Dakre: see variation];W[ba];B[ac];W[ab];B[bb];W[bi]
;B[ak];W[bc];B[kc]C[sw: Now that I think about it, M17 seems like a better threat than L17 because it could help reduce some of White's territory later in the game.

Dakre: right... first choose ko threats which are not a threat only but help your overall position as well. Play moves you'd like to play anyway, but which are sente.]
;W[lc];B[bb];W[aj];B[ai];W[bc];B[sb];W[ad];B[sc];W[rd];B[sg]
C[sw: I was aiming for the seki but didn't see atari at T17.

Dakre: do some life and death, this probably would help you to see the move at B19 and to see, that T18 was not a good threat.]
;W[kf];B[dh];W[eh];B[dg];W[fh];B[jk]C[sw: Now I'm aiming for center territory.

Dakre: good, you have to watch your center group, and you defend it while decreasing whites prospects in the center. But don't expect to make much territory there yourself ;)]
;W[bp]C[Dakre: the corner was quite big]
(;B[fm]LB[rk:A]TR[qj][qm]C[sw: I played this not only to form my moyo on the center but to prepare an attack on the White group around E11.

Dakre: Consider attacking the marked group as well... It looks weaker to me. A is a good spot to attack, but it should be prepared with a play at P5 for example]
;W[ae];B[bf]C[Dakre: very small play!! the action is around the center now!!]
;W[af];B[ag]C[Dakre: just play tenuki...];W[nd];B[ne];W[me]
;B[mf];W[le]C[sw: I actually think playing N14 to White's N15 is helping me gain more influence on the center.

Dakre: youre right. This exchange is in blacks favor. The two stones on the right are looking weaker and weaker]
;B[ni]LB[rk:B][oo:A]C[sw: Now I am acting on that influence.

Dakre. this is the wrong direction again. You're already strong here and you don't make a lot of territory with that move... The marked plays would be better]
;W[oj];B[ml]C[sw: Continuing my moyo.

Dakre: don't expect to get a lot territory in the center...]
;W[nj];B[oi]C[sw: I played at P11 to avoid any possible threat if White were to play there instead.]

;W[qo];B[po];W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[rr];W[pn];B[gg]C[sw: This begins my attack on the group around E11.

Dakre: very good, white was ignorant];W[gh];B[hg];W[if];B[hh]
;W[fj];B[gk];W[em];B[en];W[fn];B[dm];W[el]
(;B[gn]C[Dakre: all good until now... this is clearly a bad move. Don't expect white to extend on F5... white wants to rescue his D11 group!! Just play G7 and white is dead.]
;W[fl];B[gm];W[gl];B[hl];W[hk];B[hj];W[hi];B[ii]C[sw: At this point, I thought I could kill White with a stone at E11, but I felt that I had to stop the H11 stone first. Do you think G11 would've been able to help me kill the White group instead of J11?]
;W[gi];B[ei]C[sw: This is when White looks alive. I can't play F9 because White would put me into atari with E9. I'd have to play J9, and White would play E11 to make his group alive.

Dakre: you're right, at this point white is alive];W[fk];B[ik]

;W[mb];B[ho];W[ig];B[ih];W[jh];B[kh];W[kg];B[ji]C[sw: I believe this would've made a difference in whether I won or lost. I should've protected that stone first. Does my protecting the K13 stone seem to work to my benefit more? I feared that if White played at H5 before I did, then I'd lose quite a bit of territory. Would my playing at H5 first seem better than protecting K13?

Dakre: protecting the stone would be slightly better, because you don't enclose more territory this way, but H5 is bigger, i think.]

Well, thanks for reviewing my game! I hope my own comments made your review a little easier.

Again, thank you very much. I really appreciate your taking the time to review my game.

Dakre: Your endgame was quite good. So was your opening. But you should spend some time in reading out some Life and Death's. This probably would help you most. You had the opportunity to kill two white groups in one game... killing one would have made you win.
I hope the commentary is helpful. If you have any further questions I'd be glad to hear from you.]
