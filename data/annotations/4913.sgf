AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Thanks for your time Mr(s) reviewer. I am  Creeed
 10k? at KGS but probably 12k. I played black in this game. I'm not really interested ( in this game), but if you have comments please share them with me^^.

The game was decided by a fight in the upper part of the board. I was the one being chased, and didn't manage to save my group.
My questions are:

When should i have started worrying about my group?
And basically, How could i have saved it ? (if i could )

I wasn't able to handle a invasion on the left and the result was terrible. I wanted influence, i got ... a group killed. How should i have played?


Thanks again for your time and patience.

[gromit\] Hi, I'll do my best to help you understand what went wrong...]
;W[gq];B[cn];W[np];B[pn];W[kq];B[eq]TR[jd]SQ[iq]C[[gromit\] That was not a very big move, probably much less than the marked one on the top. Moreover, it will induce a protection by W of his weakness at J3.]
;W[fo];B[jd]C[[gromi\] yes! but the exchange in the lower left was not necessary.]
;W[fc];B[cf]TR[ec]SQ[jd]C[[gromit\] Since you've got a stone at K16, E17 would be more severe (removes W life base and make W heavy).]
;W[db];B[cc];W[id]C[Is the hane correct or is it better to play K17 or K15

[gromit\] K17 is solid and works well with Q16 so it seems better. K15 might be a little early too play that much towards the center and doesn't put pressure on J16 (while K17 threatens to remove the life base).

The outside hane is also a bit strange w.r.t. direction: what is it trying to build (center? not yet)?]
;B[ie];W[ic];B[je]C[[gromit\] The connection is correct and solid. The hane and connection is however a bit slow (W is settled and gains sente), but with a big handicap that might be enough...]
;W[md]LB[jc:B][kc:A]
(;B[kc]C[I didn't want to play as in the var.

[gromit\] See var: it was quite good.

However L17 is not so bad, but a weird shape :(];W[pc]
(;B[oc]C[Wrong side?

[gromit\] Yes!
L17 is strong, Q16 is weak (alone). Push from your weak group towards the strong one. See var for a possible continuation.]
;W[od];B[nc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qc]LB[mc:D][nd:A][oe:B][qe:C]C[I hesitated here.

[gromit\] A and B seem bad: atari will reinforce W
if D was necessary to save B then it would be best, but since it is not, C is the best answer.]
;B[oe]C[I played B ....];W[nd]LB[mc:A][qe:B]C[....and hesitated again.

[gromit\] now A is necessary!];B[qe]C[I played B... was it good? best?

[gromit\] No, W gets alive B wall will be far from perfect :(]
;W[mc];B[mb];W[lb];B[kb];W[nb];B[mf]C[[gromit\] W lives in sente.
B N14 and K15 are not completely connected
so W is happy.];W[oh]C[[gromit\] Looks like huge overplay!]

(;B[ph]TR[mf][nj]C[[gromit\] quite passive and not coherent with N14, see var.]
;W[pg];B[qh]TR[og]C[[gromit\] Ouch! crosscut looks better to protect P15 stones.]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[ng];B[oi]TR[nj]C[[gromit\] the marked spot (P11) seems to be more severe (don't play contact moves to attack.]
;W[ni]LB[nj:B][ok:A]TR[pl]C[[gromit\] A leaves some weaknesses on the side, so either B to attack, or Q8.]

(;B[ok]C[I didn't want to play as in the var.
[gromit\] was not so bad, see var.];W[me];B[re];W[ch]C[This is the first BIG mistake i saw when i first reviewed it.
However i have no idea on how to play this sequence.
The result is quite horrible as you will see];B[dh];W[dg];B[cg]
;W[di]
(;B[ei]LB[eh:A]C[[gromit\] Why not connecting at A??? (see var)]
;W[eh]TR[fe][ff]C[[gromit\] Now B has a really ugly shape :(
May be F14 or F15 can connect B and split W.];B[ci];W[dh];B[cj]
;W[bh];B[df]TR[fe]C[[gromit\] better to jump farther];W[ef]
;B[ee];W[ff];B[fd]C[[gromit\] strange shape again, F15 a bit better...]
;W[gd];B[ec];W[fb];B[ge];W[fe];B[ed]C[[gromit\] B cannot permit to be cut sente, so B has to play the ko (H16 for instance)!]
;W[he];B[gf];W[fi];B[hf]C[[gromit\] Yes!];W[hd]LB[ha:A][ia:C]
[hb:B][if:D]C[ [gromit\] C seems better than A (which will probably end-up gote). B is the vital point, but the cut at D makes it almost impossible to kill...]

(;B[ha]C[A desperate attempt to threaten to kill, but i couldn't find a way to kill it in the game.
Maybe in the var.?];W[hb];B[ia];W[ga];B[ja];W[eb];B[ii]C[i suddenly realized my upper group was in trouble. It had been quite a while but my unsuccessful attempt to save it resulted in ... resign.]
;W[ej];B[nj]C[Should i have just run away?

[gromit\] B has two weak groups now: J15 and C17!!!
Sinc B played J11 already, now B has to protect C17 (otherwise C18 is severe!)]
;W[mi];B[mj]LB[lk:A]C[[gromit\] Better at A, attack from a distance.

However after the O10-N11 exchange, push from the weak group (J15) towards the strong wall (P9).]
;W[li];B[lj];W[ji]C[I played all the following moves aiming to play M14. would it have changed anything?

[gromit\] I'm afraid not :(

Moreover, the strength that B is building faces nothing, so if B loses his upper group, there is no compensation!

Playing K12 and running will make the W center group get closer to the W bottom group. Then if B attacks and loses the top group, there will be weaknesses against the bottom W stones.]

;B[jf];W[hi];B[gi];W[hj];B[fh];W[gj];B[fg];W[eg];B[kg];W[kh]
;B[kf];W[gh];B[lg];W[mg];B[le];W[ij]C[resign +__-

[gromit\] Even if B didn't lose the J15 group W still has B18/C18/C15 and other moves against the top left group!

B played a slow but solid beginning, but the attack against the left invasion and the upper left group led B to get split.

Letting W get on the left side and taking influence was a strategy coherent with B's initial plan, would have avoided the bad cuts and still W wouldn't have lived easily.

Even after that connecting the upper left and upper center seemed urgent.

Finally, B often played from the wrong direction and attacked with contact moves (upper right and right side), which resulted in unsuccessful attempts.

B sould work on those aspects:
- direction
- attack from a distance
- connect weak groups

Then his influence play will become much stronger.])
(;B[hb];W[ib];B[gb];W[eb];B[cb];W[fa];B[da];W[ia];B[ka]C[maybe this kills?

[gromit\] W can still cut at J14 :(]))
(;B[eh]LB[ci:B][ei:A]C[[gromit\] now, if A, then B and Black is happy....]
;W[ci];B[ei];W[cj];B[dk];W[bl]TR[fe][bg]C[[gromit\] W group on the left side is not alive (B13 is severe), if B feels uneasy he can play around F15 first (connects everything on the top, and threatens the F17 group).]

(;B[nj];W[ok];B[oj]LB[nh:B][mi:A]SQ[db][fc][ic][id][nf][ng]
[pg][oh][ni][ok]C[[gromit\] Better exchange N11 O12 before connecting, but this is not bad for B: all the amrked stones are weak!]

(;B[nj];W[ne];B[nf];W[of];B[qg]C[[gromit\] B keeps the pressure, W stones are very weak...]

(;B[qc];W[oc];B[qb];W[mf];B[pf]C[[gromit\] W has two weak groups, B has already gained a lot of points!]
))
(;B[jc];W[kc];B[jb];W[mf]TR[cb][pf][jh]C[i couldn't find a good answer.

[gromit\] W has now 2 weak groups, I would have calmly played Q14 and wait for W to find a way to make, at least one of his groups alive.

C18 is more agressive, but possible too (Q16 is not that weak).

Jumping out around K12 might be good too: splits the 2 W groups, gets B out of danger, threatens both of the above moves.

I think B is very well!]))
