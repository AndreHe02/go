C[Hello dear reviewer,

I felt pushed around in this game, struggling with an eyeless wall.
W nullifing the influence of my wall and making territory in the proces.
I've posted my questions/comments in the game preceded with "fred".
Also general advice on how to improve my game is most welcome.

Thanks in advance for the review!

Fred



Hello Fred,

I understand you felt pushed around. You're a cautious player. As a result your opponent doesn't have many opportunities to push you around. Your opponent on the other hand was not so cautious. He played a few stones and left them to their faith for a wile. So you had many opportunities to attack and push your opponent around. As you look through this game again, try to asses the relative strengths of your groups and those of your opponent.

C[Fred: Not really sure how to answer this move?

C seems to pressure C14 most but could be overconcentrated
B leaves the corner opne but is solid
A also leaves the corner open from the left side, but closes the corner from the top



This move looks like an overplay. I'm not sure about the best answer, but C seems indeed a little overconcentrated. If black plays C, white would probably approach the corner from the other side and black would have to defend again. White can sacrifice his marked stone. A doesn't attack the marked stone very well. B is solid and attacks better. D is another possibility.]

(;B[gc];W[bd];B[cc];W[fe]
(;B[fc]LB[ed:A]C[A would defend the gap properly too and threatens the white stones more.]

(;W[qk];B[dk];W[cl]LB[bq:B][bc:A]C[This exchange strengthens white more than is strengthens black. A and B are good points to attack. Your stones in the middle of the left side are not in danger. They split two weak white groups.]
;B[dl];W[bq];B[nc]TR[fe][cf][bd]C[Black shoud attack the marked stones.]
;W[pg];B[kc]C[It would be better to play on the fourth line here. Now all black stones on the upper side are low. This will make it easier for white to put pressure and harder for black to attack the weak stones in the upper left.]
;W[oc]
(;B[np];W[fp]LB[co:A]C[Fred: This seems like a strange move to me but i don't know how to punish it.

Your answer is normal. If you want to try something, you could play A. See variation.]

;W[go];B[ep];W[po];B[nn]LB[nq:A]TR[fp][go][io][iq]C[Fred: I doubted here, between jumping out at O6 or playing O3 first to secure a base.

I think jumping is better. A would make a small base and white is threatening to make a lot of territory at the right side. This move helps a little in reducing that. It also makes it more difficult for white to link up his marked stones.]

C[White has two weak groups on the board now. He will probably get a nice amount of territory at the right side. More than black has on the upper side. The way to win this game is to attack. To find the right attacking strategy is difficult, But A looks like a nice point to strart. It strengthens the marked stones and pushes the weak stones towards your strong wall. B is big too. See variations.]

;B[nl];W[mk]LB[kk:A][mi:B]TR[ml]C[Fred: I've played A wanting to put pressure on the two W stones and extend my moyo on the left. I've the impression this is a bad move...

B would give good shape to the wall and link the wall with the above stones

B does give good shape, but it's passive. It can be good to strengten your stones and take gote. In this situation however, you need sente. White has more territory and you need to do something about it. Try to invade or attack his group.

So I think A is better, but you need to pressure white's whole group, not just those two stones. He can afford to sacrifice them.]

That very much depends on the forcing moves you have against white. In this situation I think you could make two eyes there.]

I think it would improve your game a lot if you would look carefully whether a group really needs to be strengthened or connected. If it does, look for ways to do it that simultaneously achieve some other goal, such as weakening a group of your opponent or threatening to invade somewhere.
Look also for weak groups of your opponent. If you find them, don't wait with attacking. You don't have to kill it, but try to gain something, like territory, strength or destroy some of your opponent's territory in the process. Sometimes an attack may fail, but if you don't take risks your opponent has an easy game.]
