C[s0495813: Playing white in an even game, 30 Minutes time, 5x30 seconds byo-yomi, 6.5 komi]

(;W[cj]C[This move is out of order ; here it is better to close your corner with a shimari move, look to the branch]
;B[dc]C[This move is not a good move, not a good approach move]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[dd];B[ec];W[ed];B[fd]
(;W[qf]C[Not a good place to attack; black is strong at the right botto corner, you gave your opponent a thing to easily attack]

(;W[oe];B[rf];W[pb];B[qg];W[qc];B[oc];W[ob];B[ql]C[At this corner both of you played weird moves]
(;W[jc]C[This extension is at the third line, which is not a good line to build territory, there are much bigger moves on the board like F3, or K3 even better as it is looking the corner enclosure of your opponent]
;B[hc]
(;W[ld]C[s0495813: I thik, this maybe was unnecessary, playing at the lower left corner most likely would have been better]
;B[fq]C[So your opponent take the big move first];W[cn];B[dr]
;W[cq];B[iq]MA[kq][lq][mq][nq];W[kq]C[s0495813: Here I was trying to give a choice between letting me get a base or allow me to go to the middle, the later happened.

This area is not big enough to invade, you need at least 21 open points and a route to escape to the center, here you have only 18 points so not good for invasion]

(;W[dg];B[ek]
(;W[cl]C[Too much protective, actually your both of your groups are strong ( I mean the lower left corner group and upper left side group ) so if black enters here you just lose a few points nothing more,]
;B[fl]C[Your wall is going for nothing here, your strategy is changing move to move, why do you make move 50?
To use your wall and make an area right? Then you are giving this stone, then your moves 42,38,40,36 is going for nothing,]

C[s0495813: Maybe a mistake, I thought, reinforcing the middle would be more important, than guarding the left.

Both of you are making end game moves in the middle of the game! But here you are right protecting your side is better then the move you make in the game;]

;B[nf]C[Fight the Ko don't give up easily, you have many Ko threats in the game, it is not a good style!
Ko is important, losing after you fight is better then
not fighting!]
