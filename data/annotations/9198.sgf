;B[qj];W[fq];B[hq]LB[dn:A][hq:B]TR[dj][qj][pp]C[This is a first interesting move in this fuseki.

Normally pnicer means b wants the bottom side, big moyo on lef side or to prevent big w's big bottom.
Right now b can't get big territory on the bottom because of w's hoshi, can't get big moyo because it's not prepared. Also there is no reason to reduce w's bottom, since w is quite limited there, b's r10 move already does that job.
Playing B is a big decision, but I would rather play A so b would have a solid advantage.]

;B[hc];W[hb];B[lc];W[kb];B[oe];W[nd]C[In the beginning of the game b's strategy wasn't good. W's play wasn't ideal too, but b didn't punish him for his slow moves.
In fight b lost cutting stones which made it a lot easier for w. So it's not really about reading after all.

There was no yose in this game but in both fuseki and chuban w played better.
I think you should improve your stratedic play, try solving opening and middle game problems, read books with these themes.

If have any questions about review feel free to ask me on KGS or via email.
Thank you.])

Guo Juan doesn't recommend this as w's strategy for handi games especially for teaching games.
