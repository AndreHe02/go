AB[pd][dp]C[Thanks for the review!

[Rich\] - I'll comment on both the black and white moves, in relation to black's result.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[qf];B[nd];W[pj];B[nq];W[qn]C[[Rich\] - too timid for white, I think, this move is in the direction of the stone at Q10 anyway and should have been a pincer, or at the very least at Q6.]
;B[jp];W[dj];B[cm];W[cf];B[fd];W[ef];B[jd]C[It seems like I am ahead by a whole lot here.

[Rich\] - it's all influence. The 3-3 spots can all be invaded, H & M 16, the left lower side is open... there are very few points so far. But you're way ahead on influence! You have a two-stone head start, and haven't lost anything yet.]
;W[jj];B[fo]C[[Rich\] - this seems a vague move. It doesn't defend the corner, doesn't make a big moyo, doesn't attack white. R12 would be a good invasion point, C16/D3/R16 would take big corners.]
;W[el];B[dl];W[dk];B[ek]C[I sacrifice to wall him off more effectively.

[Rich\] - It's a good principle... but he can't capture your cutting stone, so keeping him cut is a stronger move than giving him a strong shape in return for a wall - especially when he can still live along the bottom.]
;W[fk];B[em];W[ej];B[ck];W[cj];B[no];W[nm];B[cq]C[Was this appropriate here? With so many high stones, it seemed like he could mount something.

[Rich\] - It's reasonable, he could (and should) have played into your 3-3 point last move. I'd favour D3 over C3, but the thought is good.

Normally it's not good to settle back and play a defensive territorial point like this, making territory from influence, but in this case it's a big point. 

Something in the top right is also big, though, a play at P13 or R12.]
;W[jm];B[ph]C[This is what ended up losing for me I think, would K13 been better or O14?

[Rich\] - Well, losing the group was too much. You have good territory on the bottom and a lot of promise at the top; you don't really need to invade, a reduction as you suggest would keep you in the lead. 

The normal invasion point here would be R12. It keeps the two white stones better separated and makes it easier to get a base for your group if you start on the third line. 

The book Attack and Defense is excellent for situations like this, I'd recommend it.]
;W[of];B[nh];W[mf];B[ld]C[[Rich\] - If you create a weak group, you can't really come back to fix this now, unless you can do it in sente. A play around P10 (or maybe R10) is urgent. Settling weak groups is almost always your first priority.]
;W[lf]C[[Rich\] - fortunately, white lets you off!];B[ng];W[nf]
;B[pg];W[pf]C[wow, I think those peeps were a very poor choice in hindsight. Things look a whole lot worse now.

[Rich\] - Yes, you've made white much stronger and got no eyes out of it. When you're trying to settle a weak group, be prepared to give up a few stones. Don't worry about connecting them.]
;B[li]C[[Rich\] - the knight's move is generally an attacking move, because it can be cut. As a general rule, when you want to settle a group, use contact plays and sacrifice stones if you need to.]
;W[mi];B[mh];W[lh];B[ni];W[mj];B[nj];W[mk];B[ok]C[[Rich\] - again, this just encourages white to get stronger and doesn't make any eyes.]
;W[pl];B[qj];W[pk];B[rj];W[rh];B[rg];W[qg];B[qh];W[rf];B[ri]
;W[sg];B[pi]C[[Rich\] - This doesn't connect, doesn't make an eye. It only provokes a response, so you should save it for a possible later ko threat.

I think you can get an eye in ko on the side, but it's not enough..]

;W[cc]
(;B[dc]C[[Rich\] - block on the other side, here... your other stone is too close, and white isn't already safe on the left. You'll lose some territory anyway, but blocking the other side will cost him some. See variation.]
;W[cd];B[pr]C[[Rich\] - this is a big point... but you shouldn't leave the top at this point, I don't think.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[rr];B[pq];W[qp];B[op];W[on];B[ln];W[lm];B[mn]
;W[jr]C[[Rich\] - this can't survive.]
(;B[jq]C[[Rich\] - just like contact plays are good for defending weak groups, they're bad for attacking weak groups. Take the eyespace away instead. See variation.]

[Rich\] - at this stage of the game, it's worth reading it out. I don't know what your time limits were, though... but in a close game, you need all the points you can get!]

[rc][bc][ac]C[Thanks!

[Rich\] - It was a close game... reducing rather than invading would have given a comfortable win. 

I think the book Attack and Defense would be very useful for you. Spotting weak points and knowing different approaches to deal with your opponent's influence and territory would be useful.

Also, with each play, try and do something that threatens to do more than one thing. Don't take territory if you can take slightly less territory *and* threaten to invade, for example.

And finally... weak groups always get priority!])
