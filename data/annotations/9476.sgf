C[Hello,

I played black in this game. I made the huge mistake in move 65. However, please let me know how I can improve my game.

Thank you in advanced for your help.

Perhaps I should invade around C4?

R7 is first obvious mistake. It's played on the wrong direction. the combination between R7 and the joseki  on the right corner is weird. It doesn't help to keep territories or develop the center.]

I agree. B's better but C10 is very slow. Nearly have no meaning the left side is not territories and 2 white stones at F10 seem not easy to attack]

Maybe C4 is better?

Yes. if your endgame's strong enough. In my opion, w has a better position in endgame cause he's having sente and leading on the board about 6-10 points. The problem for B is how much he can make around O14 area become solid territories. But w still have sth like D17, C8 as good points for endgame]
