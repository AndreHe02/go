AB[pd][dp]C[[PC, Reviewer\]: You played some good moves in this game, but also made nontrivial mistakes both through carelessness of playing haphazardly and through missing opportunities to punish your opponent.  Let me apologize because I am not good at handicap games.  I will just treat this game as if it were not a handicap game, as I don't know any handicap joseki.

Hello reviewer,

I know we're not supposed to send wins, but this game was extremely close: 1.5 points.  Unlike most of my games, it wasn't determined by me or my opponent making a forehead-slapping mistake (those 20 stones are in atari?  Whoops).  That's why I want it reviewed - we both played well, by DDK standards; hopefully you can tell me how to play well by SDK standards :).  Thanks for your time!

C[I probably would have waited until later to play this move.  At present there are too many obvious responses that are painful for white.  Black could play N14 for instance, and then based on your response either attack O16 or O13 group.  This move would be better saved until later when either the O16 stone wouldn't be putting itself into such a precarious position, or the O13 stones were a little stronger, or there was another white stone near L13 to make running difficult for B.  In any case, I would have played an approach in the lower right at this point, probably O3.  If for some reason you hate O3 you could also try a moyo move around K14.]
;B[le];W[lc];B[oc];W[rd];B[qb];W[qc]C[I don't like this move now.  There are bigger moves on the board: O3, J15, C14.

You can't kill that group at present.  Come back to it later when nearby stones have changed.]
;B[pc];W[lg];B[nc];W[md]C[This move means you will try to kill or at least manipulate the black stones.  Otherwise it's not worth saving this stone (just a few points).  But be careful - can black run out right into the middle of your territory and/or live easily in the corner? If so, don't play this move yet.  Play a bigger move elsewhere as I've noted several times already.  All those moves are still more important than this one.]
;B[mc];W[ld];B[mf];W[ke];B[kf];W[je];B[gc];W[ge];B[nq];W[qq]
C[Now you're too late to make a good invasion in lower right.  This 3x3 invasion withO4 already present can only be successful as a ko. Better would have been to play D17 to kill G17 stone and take your territory in the corner.]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[ro];W[qo];B[rq];W[rn];B[so];W[on];B[pn];W[om]
;B[pm];W[ln]C[Your invasion of the corner was a disaster.  It's a good idea for you to study the ko invasion and try it in some games to learn about it, but overall you were just too late.  You have some ok stones in the center as partial compensation, but the moyo is not strong enough to compensate for all the territory black has secured in the corner, and your upper left is still weak.]
;B[em];W[dl];B[fk];W[fi];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec]C[This move is very aggressive.  You can only play like this if you read it out carefully.  Maybe it's ok, maybe not.  By the following sequence, you show that you had not read it out well.  If you're not going to read it out well, you should play safely (E16).]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[fd]C[Now you have lost a stone and black got a huge territory and is totally safe.  Even worse, you have a very ugly cutting point left at D15.  You should try some alternative moves to E15 (try F17) just to see what happens, and to consider whether E17 was a good move or not.]

(;W[jg]C[HUGE opportunity lost here.  You should have attacked the big black group.  This was your chance. See alternate sequance at move 95.]
;B[mg];W[lh];B[mh];W[nh];B[mi];W[mk];B[li]C[Very painful for white to have black cut through like this.  N9 was not the best move.  You should have blocked at M11.]
;W[oo];B[po];W[op]C[I don't like this move P4.  You make O3 much stronger.  You should have saved the aji for later, or attacked at M3 directly.]

C[I would have invaded at C3, as it is a little bigger.  You just help black secure the corner.]
;B[fr];W[gr]C[Maybe G4 would have been better here.];B[cq]C[this move was probably unecessary by black.  in any case, if black is unable to read it out, he should have played A3 or A4 which both make the corner much clearer but also attack left side.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[hp];B[go];W[ho];B[fo]C[again black makes an error.  G6 would have been better.]
;W[rb];B[qa];W[ra];B[ob];W[ij]C[I think this was bad.  nevertheless black also erred in response: black should have connected at J11 then advanced to K9 area to destroy w moyo, potentially kill J10, and if not, b makes life with N18 in sente.]
;B[hj];W[kk];B[ii];W[hh];B[jk];W[jl];B[jj];W[il];B[ik];W[gl]
;B[gk];W[gm];B[fl]C[yet another unnecessary move by black.  this move is worth absolutely nothing, zero, zilch.  H18 is huge.  N18 is big. B5 is ok. This F8 is horrible.  The recent sequence of 10 moves, black made 3-4 major errors, and between these 3 errors you made up for the handicap.]
;W[ok];B[ol];W[nl];B[hl];W[hm];B[kl];W[km];B[ll];W[lk]C[empty triangle.  Bad.  You should have played K10, which would have given you a chance later to make 1 extra point of territory while also saving the L9 stone.]
;B[im];W[jm];B[in];W[hn];B[io];W[ip];B[co];W[dn];B[bn]C[you should have played here B6 instead of D6.  it would have been sente and very big.]
