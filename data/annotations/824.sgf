;B[ik]C[Possibly a good move.  While will have to scramble to keep alive]
;W[qn]LB[ko:a]C[Given that the white group at the bottom is in danger, and correspondingly black is threatening a huge territory on the bottom, this is not a good way to attack.  Some direct attempt to escape is in order, perhaps at "a".  White will probably have to sacrifice the two stones already in play, but black will not be able to defent the entire bottom.]
;B[ql]LB[pn:a]C[This isn't the best response.  Given the potential for a huge territory on the bottom, I would just press white down with "a"]

;B[jm];W[lq]
(;B[io]LB[lr:a]C[This is a serious blunder. Black can't separate white with this move, and will lose much more than necessary for  trying.  Black should try to connect underneath at "a".
This move actually make the situation worse, since white gets to respond in a way that steals a crucial black liberty.]

(;B[in]C[Black doesn't understand the seriousness o fhe situation, and saves one stone.  Connecting is not a possibility becuase black runs out of liberties.]
