C[is there any tips when it processes to the middle of the game? for instance, as i know, if there's black first put on the Q16, and white then put its stone on O17. so in turn when the black put the stone on the N16, then white places stonce on O16 against the black, with reinforce the power of the black, placing the black stone on O15 is the strong move against white; which is the strategy when games process to the middle. (for i know how to explain in english well, so try to exaplain in a stupid way.)


I review the fuseki and middlegame not the endgame (but I see some light mistake also there).
In the beginning of the game white make some strange moves but you, with f9 and j6, beat him in nonsense moves.
You have risked that white enclose a big area but then you make a good invasion (and your opponent some slow moves). At the end of invasion white lives in 2 corner where you should kill him. I hope is clear how now (I don't give you an exaustive explication in such a way that you can think to your mistakes )
An hint for you is:  make life and death problems];B[pd];W[ep]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[jc];W[jp];B[qj]C[This move is better played in q10 for a balanced formation of the 3 star-poin (sanrensei).]
;W[jj]C[1st, how to choice the better next move in the game, according to the situation?  and 2nd, how to make judement properly on the situation between white and black?

what position would be a better choice.
after reviewing this game again, i suppose seemly the C10 would be a better place to reduce the white area. however, it seems that C3 can make real compound for the black immediately, though perhaps let the white takes outside.
but, according to someone's (higher level than mine, 1d* or so) suggestion (but not to this game), it's better to make black area  concrete first. better not rush to go in to the white side under its force.


C10 is a good choice: a large point to develop quickly your stones]
;B[fc]C[also this is not bad];W[fe];B[hd]C[Overconcentrated. Take some risk and play c10 now o however something like c14.
Hold your stones light];W[dj];B[fk]C[Strange move. White position is still open. In a situation like this good point of invasion are c14 c4 (too early for contact move like c10 o d9).
This move is vague];W[fi];B[in]C[not good for the same reason of f9]

(;B[nc]C[No ...too slow. White moyo is too big, you have to try something less easy and defensive then 017 or you remain behind.
