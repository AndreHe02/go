C[Hello,

My name's Damien. I'm French 8k and OGS 4k (dmg).

I'll try to review the game.
Most problems I have seen are simple reading problems. I therefore advice you
to do tsumegos ("go problems" www.goproblems.com) it will help your reading improve a lot.

Once you have studied some tsumegos it might be a good idea to try to be a bit more agressive in the earlier chuban (middle game).

Also ask yourself the simple questions :
   - Are my groups in danger. If yes protects.
   - Are opponent's group in danger. If yes attacks.
   - Else plays big points.

Attacking an opponent's group is a good way to construct territories. Therefore when you force your opponent to flee, you must chose a direction that is good for you (constructs or enabling you to attack another group).

I hope this review will help you :)

;B[pc];W[nd];B[qf]C[Until now, everything looks ok for me. Even thought I doubt the orientation of D3 stone i cannot say it's bad.

R14 here could be played a bit upper at Q14.];W[ci]
(;B[dd]LB[dc:B][ce:C][ci:A]TR[nc][nd][od]SQ[jc][jd][kd]C[White A here was probably a direction mistake because it's not really attacking C, B is weak and the three triangle stones are waiting for an extension at the square points.

Therefore to exploit this mistake I would have pincer B around F17. If white try to pressure C it will get attacked (see variation).

D16 stones here is just renforcing both triangles stones and B (since your pushing B towards the triangle stones)]
