AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[K- hi, thanks for sending this game for review. I'll mark my comments with my initial, K, like this one.]
PL[W];W[gd]C[K- how strong is your opponent, playing white? a 4 stone handicap is a medium level handicap so if this game is balanced then s/he will be a bit stronger than you but not a lot.]
;B[fc];W[nc];B[oc];W[jd];B[cj]TR[ce][qf]C[Black: I attempted to grab more territory rather than try to invade the top where white was making territory.

K- I know what you mean, but really neither of you are making territory yet - nowhere is secure for either player. If you want to really make territory, you could play either of the marked points to enclose one of the corners. But this move is not a mistake by you - your instinct to play a big move elsewhere and not simply follow white around the board is absolutely correct..]
;W[cf];B[ce];W[bf];B[df]LB[be:A][ej:B]C[K- playing at A would be better here because it means your position in the corner acts as a strong foundation to build on. By playing as you did, white can jump into the corner underneath your stones, undermining your group. Also, if you had played at A then white would probably have played another stone near his stones here, meaning you could then jump to B in response, which starts to build a moyo in the lower left area of the board.... and white's stones would still be weak and without a stable base.]
;W[be]LB[bd:A]C[K- OK so white didn't realise he could actually have jumped in at A here, but this is something to look out for in your games in the future,]
;B[bd];W[bi];B[bj];W[ci];B[di]LB[qf:B][cj:A]C[K- the move you played is tempting but it is the wrong strategy for handicap game. The reason is this: in a handicap game, black starts with an advantage so white is trying to catch up from behind right from the first move. White's best way to do this is to get black into lots of fights, because white is (by definition) the stronger player so will usually have the advantage in a fight. The more complicated white can make the game, the more likely s/he is to quickly catch up from being behind at the start and then take the lead. Therefore, the best strategy for black is to do the opposite: keep the game simple and try to hang on to the lead. What does this mean in terms of actual moves? well, white will usually try to play moves that makes black feel it is necessary to respond, and then another and another, so white moves around the board and black follows. What works better for black is to respond only with calm defensive moves and to look for every opportunity to play elsewhere - and these moves elsewhere should not be invasions but taking big points on the board (like your move at A for example) or smaller moves to secure territory (like B for example)]
;W[dh];B[cg];W[bg];B[qj]LB[dg:A][jp:B]C[Black: Should have played at A instead to weaken the white structure.  This part would remain white's territory, but would have been smaller.

K- Actually no, you did the right thing here. Your stone in that fight on the left is weak, that is true, but also it is only worth a couple of points. So you can sacrifice it if you can get more points by playing elsewhere. You have taken a valuable point on the right side, and if white's next move is at A to seal in your stone, then you get another move to take another big point, for example B]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[eh];B[ff];W[nq];B[or]LB[qn:D][kq:C][lq:B][pq:A]
C[K- when you have a star point stone in the corner and your opponent approaches with this small knight's move, there are many responses you could make but one that is surprisingly simple and effective is what I have highlighted here at A. The reason it works well is it threatens to attack the whtie stone with a follow up move at B so white will need to defend, usually by playing at C. If white is tempted to jump further away, then the attack at B remains a weakness for the future. Then, once white has played at C, black has a choice - either you can secure the corner with D, or you can play elsewhere - depending on what is more valuable when you look at the whole board. So to recap : when white attacks your star point stone like this, the simple extension to A keeps things strong, simple, and gives you the initiative for what you want to do next. Perfect strategy for black in a handicap game!]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro]
(;B[qn]C[K- there is another common alternative here, see the variation I have added]
;W[rn];B[rm]LB[qm:A][po:B]C[K- this move should be at A, because otherwise you get 2 cutting points (A and B) which makes your wall very weak]
;W[qm];B[rl];W[pm];B[no]LB[pn:B][po:A]TR[pm][nq]C[Black: Should have connected at A or B.  Made mistake of not recognizing white's move at Q7 (Triangle) was meant to capture the two stones.  Mistakenly thought it was to connect with the stone at O3 (Triangle).  This mistake cost me my wall.

K- yes, this is the problem with the 2 cutting points that I mentioned before]
;W[po];B[op];W[lp];B[ip];W[gq];B[fq];W[iq];B[gp];W[hq];B[jq]
LB[hp:A]C[Black: Should have played at A instead to wall off white.  By letting white through the position of the surrounding black stones was weak leading to inevitable stone captures and white breaking through.  The original thought was to surround on the right side to avoid white linking with the other stones.

K- yes, you are right. Again it's the problem of having too many cutting points close together which usually leads to something getting captured.]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[io];B[jp];W[go];B[fp]C[Black: Wanted to defend the corner instead of the center.  Therefore let H5 be captured instead.]
;W[hn];B[dm]C[Black: Attempting to secure the lower left corner by linking stones on row 10 and on lower left star point.]
;W[dj];B[ei]LB[di:B][bk:D][dk:C][fp:A]TR[bj][cj]C[K- a few moves earlier you mentioned you made a decision to defend the corner when you played at A, so the same applies here - the stone at B isn't worth much so you can sacrifice it for the bigger gains in defending the corner. So you could have played at C here instead. Just be careful though, because your marked stones are looking a bit short of liberties, white could jump under to D and capture them so you will need to play another move to prevent that.]
;W[ej];B[fi];W[ck];B[bk];W[cl];B[cm]TR[bj][cj][bk]C[Black: At this point the three stones (Triangle) were already deemed "dead".  Therefore to limit the point loss and continue to secure the corner C7 was played to block white's wall.

K- yes, agreed];W[bl];B[dk]TR[dj][ej][ck][bl][cl]C[Black: Played to threaten white (Triangle).  Though it may have been better to play elsewhere since this threat did not require a response from white.

K- that's right];W[qe];B[qd];W[pe];B[re]LB[qg:A]C[K- playing this stone at A is more damaging to white here, because you have backup lower down the right side which makes it a strong attack and takes away the easy options for white to make a stable base for these stones]
;W[rf];B[qf]LB[rd:A]C[Black: Should have played A instead to protect invasion from white.  This mistake lead to white almost taking the corner.]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[se];B[qc];W[ne];B[ob]LB[nb:A][od:B]C[Black: Should have played at A or B to expand territory.  The move made was too conservative and self-limited the size of the corner.

K- agreed];W[nb];B[gc]LB[bm:A]C[Black: Once it was clear the corner territory size is at it's max (which was already small) the idea was to expand from the upper left side to expand into the top.

K- you were right to play elsewhere, but I would say playing at A is more urgent to secure the bottom right corner]
;W[hd];B[hc]C[Black: Keep on expanding....];W[ic];B[ib];W[jb]
;B[hb];W[kn];B[ko]C[Black: Beginning attempt to connect stones and declare territory betweek K-P, 1-5.  Though not certain it would be possible...

K- the biggest problem you will have in that plan is that your stones in this area are quite weak - no eyes, and with stronger white stones each side; you certainly have to try something to save them but it will be a tough fight :)]
;W[lo];B[lq];W[mq];B[mr]LB[lr:A]C[Black: Could have played at A instead to avoid a cut to lose N2.

K- agreed, also playing at A would give  you options to connect towards your stones on the left]
;W[lr];B[kq];W[nr]
(;B[kr]LB[mp:A]TR[lo][lp]C[Black: Instead of blocking at L2 perhaps could have threatened white stones (Triangle) at A instead.

K- unfortunately it doesn't work - see variation];W[ls];B[ks]
;W[ms];B[mp];W[np];B[mo];W[jo]
(;B[os]LB[ln:A]TR[lo][lp]SQ[np][mq][nq][lr][nr][ls][ms]C[Black: Could have threatened to take white stones (Triangle) with A instead.  By not performing this threat now I may have lost the chance to take the stones if white captured L5.  The thought process behind this move was to capture the large set of white stones (Square).

K- actually playing at A is more than a threat, it is a capture by snapback - see variation]
;W[oo];B[ln];W[pr]LB[ns:A]TR[op][pp][pq]C[Black: How could we have prevented the imminent capture of our stones (Triangle)?  This mistake leads to white surviving...

K- I don't think you can save these stones - the problem was that all your black stones in this area were quite weak and at a disadvantage in this fight, so you have done well to do as well as you have. Your next move should be at A, which would capture 3 white stones in exchange for the 3 you lose, plus it would give you the second eye for this black group. White is already alive in the corner and doesn't need to capture these 3 black stones to make life]
;B[on]LB[ns:A]SQ[qn][qo]C[Black: Attempted to save previously dead stones (Square).  Though this did not work out.  Thus, what could have been a better move?

K- playing at A instead would be best];W[oq];B[pn];W[nn];B[mn]
;W[om];B[qg]TR[qj][rl][rm]C[Black: Thinking could try to remove white's potential to take the right side.  Though this proved to be a non-threat

K- this is a good move - not because it is a threat to white, but because it is the starting point to make your marked stones safe on the right side]
;W[ao]LB[am:A][bm:B][an:D][bn:C]TR[bl]C[K- the relationship between the 2 marked stones in this position is called a "monkey jump" (it is when one stone is on the second line and you jump down to the edge from it with a large knight's move). It has the special property that playing in any of the points A B C or D cannot prevent the 2 stones from connecting. It can be very damaging - the best defence is to prevent it being possible by blocking it before it happens (in this case that would mean playing at B before white makes the monkey jump).]
;B[bm]C[Black: Did not see this invasion coming as thought the corner was relatively secure.  Thus trying to mitigate the invasion by trying to avoid the stone from linking with it's nearby white stones.]
;W[am];B[dl];W[al];B[bn];W[an];B[bp];W[ap];B[bq];W[oj]C[Black: Lost the entire first line.  White can run this wall to the end without a good way for me to block.]
;B[ph]LB[rg:A]C[K- best move in this area is at A, to secure the eyespace for your group, making it strong so you can then push outwards (think of it as pulling your fist back in preparation to make a punch - you need to build up the power before you strike)]
;W[jj];B[fh];W[ch];B[ih]LB[ir:A][is:B]TR[jj][oj]SQ[lo][lp]C[Black: Misread white's intent with stones in middle (Triangle).  Originally thought white was looking to link top and bottom.  Did not notice threat to black stones on the bottom until too late.

K- black stones are safe providing you play at A and follow up with B or similar; you have 1 eye alrready with the capture of the marked stones (squares) and you can easily make a 2nd eye on the edge]
;W[lj];B[lh];W[hr]C[K- THIS is the move that kills your stones on the bottom]
;B[ir]LB[ll:D][ml:E][km:C][jn:B][is:A]C[Black: Should have played A instead to avoid immediately losing stone.  B is another possibility to cut the weak connection between white stones.

K- you desperately need a 2nd eye, playing at A won't help now; really your only opportunity to make some eyespace is by expanding into the centre - you could start with C and follow up with D or E? it's going to be a real struggle but don't give up - white may make a mistake!]
;W[is];B[jr];W[km];B[nm]C[Black: Wasted move as the threat to the stone was too small....Should have made a more earnest attempt to save black in lower right if possible (?)]
;W[mm]C[Black: At this point it would probably have been valid to resign since it seems clear with the loss of such a large space in the bottom and bottom right gives white the decisive victory.

K- unfortunately yes];B[on];W[lm];B[rg];W[hk];B[ok];W[nk];B[ol]
;W[nl];B[pl];W[es];B[dr];W[fm];B[en];W[fn];B[fo];W[ek];B[el]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[gl]C[K- ok, so some final comments... hopefully the comments during the game have answered some of your questions. In terms of top 3 tips to take away, would say this:
1) always think about eyespace - when defending, make sure you give your groups space to make eyes, especially when it looks like your group may be getting surrounded and not be able to expand into a new area; when attacking, reducing the opponent's eyespace is a deadly "slow kill" tactic
2) don't be drawn into following your opponent around the board - especially when you are black in a handicap game; sometimes there will be an urgent move that you must play, but if not then think about making an exchange in your favour - if you sacrifice something here, can you gain something bigger elsewhere?
3) look out for little vulnerabilities around the edge of the board, like the monkey jumps that white played on you in this game; leaving your position open at the edge can leave you open to surprisingly large damage!

Finally - thanks for sending your game in for review, I enjoyed going through it and hope my comments helped.]

(;B[ln];W[kp];B[ko]))
(;B[ln];W[mn];B[lm];W[mo]TR[qn][qo]C[K- white's stones can get more liberties quite easily, and have a strong group nearby to connect to (remember that the marked black stones are dead)]
))
(;B[rn];W[qn];B[po];W[rm];B[rp];W[sn];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr]LB[qj:A]
TR[rm][qn][sn][ro]C[K- with this alternative, you get the corner and white gets the marked stones - which are still weak but will probably live. You can use this alternative when you don't mind white having a position on the side - in this case, your stone at A is already in place to limit white's expansion here so it works in your favour]
