T : Hi, I'm Tilwen, my comments will start with "T :".];B[pd]

T : Just for the record, if you want to split white on the left side, it is more common to play low (on the third line), because white already has influence,(see variation).]

T : I would rather play C10 here because it links your stones better and even make some points. With your move it is not clear what you get, influence won't be that good because all white stones feel strong.]
;W[ch]
(;B[fd];W[dc]C[

T : Here we see that your stone only separates two groups that can easily live independantly no ? Then I think F 16 was not the better move. Maybe trying to take the corner was best ? I show some possibilities.]
;B[ic];W[ke];B[ie]TR[ic][fd]C[Deterius [6k\]: Not that bad up until now I think?
Deterius [6k\]: That Group is may be a bit week];W[bl]C[

T : Now we see that C10 was important.];B[cj];W[bj];B[cl];W[bm]
;B[cm];W[do]
(;B[dn]C[Deterius [6k\]: Suddenly the Bgroup locks very smal]
;W[ql]C[Deterius [6k\]: Invasion of cause
Deterius [6k\]: But how to handle thet in the best way?



T : This is a complicated question. First, we need to realize than Q11 and Q5 are both high (on fourth line), so this is probably impossible to kill this. Then we need to think about what we want. Let us be sure that all our groups live, and here it seems that Q5 could be strengthened. I suggest then R6.]

(;B[om]C[Deterius [6k\]: the upper group is stronger so I try to puh W up


T : Good idea, but I would first take the base + points with R6.]
;W[rj]C[Deterius [6k\]: hi];B[ri];W[qj];B[qi];W[qn];B[pm];W[qm]
;B[ok]C[


T : Connecting is usually not bad, but here the upper group is solid, then just playing R5 makes your groups strong and takes more points while reducing white.]
