AB[pd][dp]C[walleye [1k\]: Hi
efhilt [2d\]: hi];W[cd]C[Reviewed by Steve Fawthrop (DrStraw), AGA 5d.
Comments by the reviewer are labeled SGF (his initials)];B[pp]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[ic];B[cj];W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[pn]
(;W[lo]LB[kp:A]C[SGF: This is the first move which seems out of place.  The joseki move is A.]
;B[oq]
(;W[or];B[pr]
(;W[nr]LB[or:A]SQ[lo]C[SGF: W is starting to look heavy.  He should treat A as kikashi. If W were going to play this move now then it would have been better to just play it directly without exchanging the previous two move.  But it is not too easy to make good shape after the marked stone.]
;B[jq]LB[mp:A]C[SGF: Good position for B.  With the peep at A available it is hard for W to attack the two B stones.]
;W[ql]C[SGF: I think this is premature.  When B moves out W will have two weak groups.]

(;B[om];W[qo];B[po];W[qn]
(;B[jo]LB[qp:A]C[SGF:  Playing A seems more important for the stability of the corner. W must respond.]

(;W[mm]LB[lm:B][lo:A]C[SGF: This just feels wrong to me.  There is the old proverb that the sake bottle is overconcentrated.  However, I have to admit that after the bad shape move at A it is hard to see a good shape move.  Perhaps B is better.]

(;B[pk]C[walleye [1k\]: I think this is a mistake, should be at P9

SGF: Yes, I agree.];W[pl];B[ol];W[ok];B[nk];W[oj]
(;B[ml]C[walleye [1k\]: I overestimated the momentum I'd gain from this sacrifice

SGF: This position is complicated but I don't think this move is correct.  It is too direct.  I have shown a few variations.]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[ll];B[lk];W[kl]
(;B[mi]LB[kn:A]C[SGF: This is ugle shape. A looks like the key point.]

(;W[qi]LB[oh:A]C[walleye [1k\]: Q10 seems better for W

SGF:  How about A?  Keep the big B group from connecting to the corner. Maybe that will be enough to reduce the corner later.]

(;B[kn]C[walleye [1k\]: A small mistake? feels inconsistent with my followup

SGF: No, I think this is a key eye-stealing tesuji.];W[ln];B[oi]
LB[nj:B][pj:A]C[walleye [1k\]: makes R11 look bad right?

SGF:  Not really.  After W protects at A it is possible to play B.  If W later gets to slide in the corner this ability may be crucial because it kill an eye.]
;W[pj];B[il];W[kk];B[lj];W[jm];B[hn]LB[dn:A]C[walleye [1k\]: I'm proud of that move

SGF: It is nice shape but it is putting all the eggs in one basket.  If white escapes then the corner is open for white to invade and the black territory is not huge.  I think a good case can be makde for playing at A because white is not likely to come through this hole to try to live.]

(;W[kj]C[walleye [1k\]: seems like bad shape for white

SGF:  It is probably better for W to try to live on the side first.]
;B[ki];W[ji];B[jh];W[kh];B[li];W[ii];B[kg];W[ih];B[jg];W[fq]
C[SGF:  This move should havce no chance of living.   The 3-3 point is the only place.]

(;B[dq]C[walleye [1k\]: is there a better move for black? d6?

SGF: This looks like the best way to make white struggle and it also protects the corner.]
;W[cn]C[SGF:  White should have played this in preference to F3, but I think the 3-3 invasion was even better.]
;B[co]C[SGF:  This strengthens the W stone because after D6 black must split the two groups. B5 looks more interesting to me.]
;W[dn];B[eo];W[en]
(;B[fo];W[ej]C[walleye [1k\]: this felt too easy for W, the game seems close now

SGF:  Agreed, which is why B5 instead of C5 was preferable.]
;B[cg];W[jp];B[ip];W[kp];B[iq];W[kq]C[walleye [1k\]: a mistake for W? too slow?

SGF:  I don't see what white gained by this sequence.  He was alive anyway so why take gote to play this?  The left side is the focus of the game.]

(;B[pb]C[walleye [1k\]: should I have invaded around E17 instead, are my C10 stones strong enough?

SGF: It is big, and threates L17 so it is hard to say it is wrong.  But I think the left side is more urgent.]
;W[df]
(;B[cf]LB[dk:A]SQ[cn][dn][en]C[SGF: I don't like that as it is sure to make white solid at the top.  I think I would try something against the three marked stones first.  How about A to see how white responds?]
;W[ce];B[dg];W[ef];B[cl]LB[dk:A]C[SGF:  As the sequences above showed, this seems to be better at A]
;W[dk];B[bl];W[bo];B[bp];W[do];B[cp];W[bm]
(;B[di]LB[dl:A]C[SGF: Seems to timid.  Why not counterattack at A?]
;W[ei]
(;B[fk]LB[dl:A]C[SGF:  Black wastes the put and cut starting with A]
;W[dl]
(;B[ck]C[walleye [1k\]: maybe C9 was unnecessary
walleye [1k\]: I thought i was farther ahead than I actually am

SGF: Looks dangerous to ignore.];W[if];B[eg];W[ff];B[lc]
(;W[kb]C[walleye [1k\]: there should be a better move than that rght?

SGF: Nothing jumps out at me.  See my comments on your variation.]
