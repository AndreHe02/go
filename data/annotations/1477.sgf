(;W[no]C[This is a difficult position, and I'm not sure which joseki is the best. Personally, I would prefer the attachment at R3, but I'm afraid I'm not competent to answer which is the best move.]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[mp];W[nn]C[This move is unusual, even according to Ishida (see Dictionary of Basic Joseki, Vol. II, p. 99). Usually, white extends to M6.]

(;B[qn]C[The plan of the connection at N4 is playing P3, and according to Ishida this move should be played even though white connected at O6. On the other hand, since black is strong in the lower left corner, white can't put much pressure on black by separating black with a move at Q3. This move also makes it difficult for white to get a base. Since you can't really attack the three black stones, the result is good for black.]
;W[jq]C[This attack looks a bit reckless.];B[oq]C[Good.];W[pq]
C[This move doesn't seem to work.];B[pp]
(;W[nq]C[Aji-keshi. This atari only strengthens black. The atari at P2 doesn't work right now, but it is a serious threat after a white play around L5]
;B[or];W[np];B[nr];W[lr];B[mr]C[This is a terrible result for white.]
;W[ck]C[I would not like to allow a black hane at M6. I don't know what is worse - allowing the kakari at C14 or the hane at M6. White is in trouble.]
;B[ci]C[I think this is the wrong direction - white plays first in a more or less symmetrical position and should get the initiative.]
;W[cn]C[This move looks dubious, too. White can't get a proper base, so he should counter-attack at C13 or play lightly at E9.]
;B[hq];W[jo]C[Being forced to play on neutral points in the early middle game is hard to endure.]
;B[cf];W[ee]C[This move makes it too easy for black to get a base. Attacking with B15 still looks better.]
;B[bd]C[Black has an easy game now: He has no weak groups and is ahead. White can only try to create a big moyo.]
;W[pj]C[Good.];B[pl]C[Black is clearly ahead, whites only chance is to build a big moyo at the top. I would rather play at K17 to prevent this. After white has played at K5 and Q10, attacking the heavy white group looks very slow - black has to add at least two more stones to capture six stones. If black had lost, this may have been the loosing move.]
;W[dg]C[Good. The moyo starts to get visible.];B[hc]C[The fact that black feels oblieged not to answer at C13 shows that Q8 was bad. Considering the top, I would still prefer to play at K17.]
;W[jc]C[Yes, push your opponent against your strength.];B[ec]
;W[dc];B[eb];W[cg];B[cb];W[bf];B[ei];W[je];B[he];W[er]C[A strange move, and I don't think its good.]
