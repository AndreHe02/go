C[Hello, I am Bernd, HonFu here in the ladder and on KGS.

This game is full of all-decisive fights so there were many opportunities to mess up reading, shape, directional decisions.

As it is custom here, I put questions, but please also tell me what you think about situations I didn't mention, because those are normally the "blind spots"! Please also show me where my opponent had an opportunity to deliver a blow and didn't. Judge my decision making please and show me better.

Thank you!

MR: Hello Bernd, I agree with your judgement on "all-decisive fights" and "many opportunities to mess up reading, shape and directional decisions". 
I added comments every here and there, always starting with "MR". 
In general, your opponent made it rather easy for you at some places, so it might be that future opponents will make it harder for you in similar situations. Sometimes I got the feeling that you do not like to give *anything* to your opponent, e.g. when you entered the black extension at the top or did not simply live with your upper group giving away some stones. Maybe in this situations it is good to recall that one only needs *more* territory than the opponent ;-) With respect to the center fight, I would say that it is a good idea to "step back" every now and then and to think about which stones are really important.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[jp]C[MR: More normal would be a kakari at D15 or a Chinese like opening for black.]
;W[qk]C[MR: I would prefer a kakari against the lower right corner.]

(;B[qo];W[qf]C[MR: This extension is quite far, although I can very well understand that white does not want to extend to R12 only. Consequently, black should invade directly, e.g. R12.]
;B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[ph]C[MR: The development in the upper right is far too good for white.]
;B[pf]C[MR: ?
Black should switch to the upper left with D15. The area around Q14 is not interesting for both sides.]
;W[pg];B[qe];W[re];B[of]C[Was that alright so far, or did we make mistakes?

M: To end in gote here is again very bad for black.];W[ce]C[MR: good!]
;B[hc]C[I thought this move came too close to my shimari, so I wanted to exploit that somehow ...

MR: I think that black's extension is alright. Playing J17 only would leave the extension G17 to white later. Invading the black extension on the top only helps black to give at least some sense to his stones around P14.]

(;W[jc];B[jd]C[MR: This move tends to strengthen the opponent.]

(;W[kc]C[MR: Feels too heavy for me. Why not L16? White's goal should be just to get "something".]
;B[ic]C[MR: ?];W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[jf];W[lg]C[... but now I'm not sure if this really was a suitable method. What do you think?

MR: Black made it rather easy for you ...];B[dj]C[In situations like these I never know from which direction to approach. 2-Point from the upper left doesnt seem so big, and something like C8 doesn't really guard the corner ...

MR: Yes. The black move prevents white from playing in the same area (white D10 would also fit very well in the white position). So white should not answer directly but take sente to play in another area, e.g. H3.]
;W[hq]C[... so I decided to leave it as miai and undermine his moyo. Correct?]
;B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[jq];B[kq];W[gp];B[go];W[fp];B[kr];W[pr]
C[I thought this was the logical point, but maybe it was not really necessary ... at least it will lead the game into complications.

MR: After taking profit with G4 etc., I think that it is not necessary to take away *every* area from black. Maybe it would be enough to later reduce with P5. But Q2 as a probe is alright as well, I think.]

;B[op];W[oo];B[po];W[np];B[oq]C[MR: This sequence is just to whites liking.]
;W[on];B[lp];W[mp];B[pm]C[Okay, and now wild center fighting begins. Please tell me where we messed it up!]
;W[pn];B[qn];W[qm];B[ol];W[rm];B[pk];W[pj]C[MR: Maybe R10 is better in order not to give black too much forcing moves to set up a splitting attack (white has weak groups at the top and at the bottom).]
;B[oj];W[qj]C[MR: ... especially as you played R10 now anyway ...]
;B[om]C[MR: Strange shape.];W[ln]C[MR: My first idea was N7, but if black forces with o6 and N6 directly, the fight is unclear as well.]

;B[lq];W[ml]C[MR: Tends to be aji keshi, as one might later prefer to give the atari at M9.]

(;W[jo]C[Ouch! This one I saw myself, but too late. F9 would have finished the matter, right?

MR: Why not E8. Many moves would have "finished the matter", as the black stones around K6 are dead also without white K5 (in fact *onle* without K5).]
;B[fl]C[MR: Better save the stones around K9, as then the black group around M10 remains dead and the white group at the top remains alive.]

;W[jb];B[la];W[lb];B[ka];W[md];B[lf]C[Here defending would be the logical move, but I felt I had paid enough, so I looked for a way to play more actively. What do you think?

MR: I think that the white stones around L12 are unimportant *unless* you want to kill the black group in the upper right corner. From territory point of view, you do not need to kill the black group in the upper right corner, so I would simply live with M15.]

MR: As it stands now, the black group in the upper right corner is alive, so why did you play ko for the life of the white group?]
;B[ec];W[dd];B[eb];W[db];B[cl];W[bm];B[gq]C[And now the last conflict, turning out into a large ko. My only luck was that my opponent didn't handle the ko fights not so well, but how is this situation to judge properly?

MR: Maybe it is better to give way with G2.]
