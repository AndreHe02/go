C[Dear reviewer,
I lost during the beginning of the game, but I didn't understood what was my major mistake...
could you find it ???
thank you
(LL)


N: hello, at first sight i can't see any major mistakes, which is a good thing. You made a wall, but failed to use it (see comments for a 'logic' alternative). Afterwards, you kept playing calmly and fell behind. Also in the endgame, you missed opportunities. Because of this I must disagree that you lost during the beginning. You can always turn around the game later, if you fall behind, you must try to play more aggressive and because we make many mistakes, our opponents can do the same, if we give them the opportunity. Alternatively, we can try to keep up, and hope for a good yose to equal with our opponent.

Kind regards,
Nelis (aka Lambic)

(you added a lot of variations, please discover yourself where I added something, because lack of time, i did not weed out anything)]

N: Playing on B seems the most logical to me, the top and the side felt like miai, if black plays on one side, i would play on the other side.]

what is the best point, now ??? all choices seems to be tought for white...
(LL)

N: I think this depends on your playing style. I would also be tempted to play A, but it feels a bit local

C seems bad, your chances of attacking the two-space jump seem small to me.
B seems ok, but because your wall is not so strong, it will be difficult indeed
You might also go for a reduction, followed by a san-san invasion]
(;W[rp];B[ro];W[qo];B[po];W[qp];B[qe]TR[cc][nc][qi][oo]C[differents ideas, but what to do ???
(LL)

Invasion on top seems possible
The invasion on the left seems easy to attack, so maybe a reduction is locally better
P5 is too small, too local, too slow]
