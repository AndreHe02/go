;B[pd];W[jj];B[dp];W[jp];B[jn]C[White chooses an unconventional opening, but you don't have to follow his lead.  Since you take black in this game, you
shoul
d control the tempo.  Play at one of the empty corners (I am sure you know a corner move is bigger at this point of the game).]

C[This is the wrong direction.  Since you build a wall at the lower right, you should force white to run to your wall (a
stand
ard attack technique).  The game move allows white move away from your wall.  An attack at 'a' or 'b' is better.  I prefer 'a'
becau
se a move at 'b' will be answered by 'c', which makes the cut at 'd' possible.]
