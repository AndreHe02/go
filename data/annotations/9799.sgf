C[Hello dear reviewer , Im Mythical 1k kgs and i would like you to help me find faults in this game and in my ideas , in my head this game should have gone my way but for some reason it didnt , perhaps my ideas were wrong?

hope you will help me.

Hello Mythical,

Thank you for this game! I'll provide you some ideas.

;W[pj]LB[pc:B][kf:A]C[but he didnt...

Well, but why you switched for playing in his background (at the bottom)? Prove him wrong and kill the group (I'll give some variations for that). If that's impossible, maybe some previous moves (e.g., A or B) were a wrong plan?]

My idea is that you missed a chance to kill directly. Forcing moves aren't good enough, since you have no other objects to attack.]

;W[ll]LB[hp:A][hq:B]C[white made some eye shape , now i felt attacking him/getting profit in middle is hard

Yes, the A move resulted in destroying your centre at all (and White still can connect with B, so he didn't lose much territory).]

I don't see a way here, too - the aji is too small. Moreover, you destroyed your connection (a weakness at A), so, please, be accurate before playing.]

games like this dissapoint me  - when i feel i didnt produce the result.



thanks in advance !


Well, let's see into the main components of this failure.

1)A was a good move (more active than 1), but you didn't turn it into benefit.

2)After B, White got C (and later D) - now White should only keep his groups alive, while Black should make some whole-board decisions and severe attacks. That doesn't mean that White is better, but it means that it's harder for Black to keep the advantage.

3)With E stone, you made no profit - these stones didn't affect the C group, and the following attack was slow.

4)F wasn't a good point to start a fight, because White was stronger in that area.

By the way, attack is harder than defence, so it gives you more experience and learning opportunities. With that, I believe you'll do better in the following games.

I think no - both variants (this and the actual game) are similar with playing A, White B, and then exchanging C-D. But you played C first, not A, so you are likely to prove they are NOT the same.]
