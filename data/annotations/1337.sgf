C[Dear Reviewer,

Thanks for reviewing the game.

I played Black in this game.  Some of my own thoughts are as follows:  I felt b was doing ok through the opening stage of the game.  with thickness in the center, it felt as if b had good prospects for winning.  then suddenly the tides turned and b ended up by losing a lot.  Is this a correct judgment?  If so, can you please pinpoint the places where b made some serious strategic errors?  There are some tactical problems, and I've spotted most of them.  Please take a look at these as well, and let me know if you don't agree with my assessment.  I've also added some comments of my own.  Please respond to them if you feel they are outrageously mistaken.

Thanks again.

Cheers,
Ken




Hi,

I added quite a few coments and a few variations. I hope they are helpful. Good luck (?) is your future games!


Jarkko];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[qn];W[nq];B[rp];W[jc];B[mc]
SQ[jc]LB[gc:a][ec:b][fc:c]C[is this any any good?

Answer: It puts some pressure on the white stone and protects the corner a bit - however it does not do either too well. The problems are: When white expands to [a\], his stones will be very safe since the stone you played is one line further from the marked white stone than preferred if you really like to attack it sometime in the future. Also, at this early point of the game the move you played is not the biggest one - how about making the smimari at [b\] or [c\] instead? If you play at [c\], you will make miai of attacking the white stone and expanding down the left hand side.]
;W[gc];B[ec]SQ[mc]LB[lc:a]C[This is what I anticipated with B9, and it felt it was good for B to get a corner enclosure while creating some potential pressure for W.

Corner enclosure (shimari) is big and strong, however since the marked stone is one line too far from the white stones, they are actually quite strong and hard to attack strongly even in the future (just imagine white play tsuke at [a\]).]
;W[ci]C[Now white got the sente to erase the thickness of your shimari.]
;B[gd]SQ[ci]LB[hd:a][cn:b][ck:c][cg:d]C[This was perhaps a little rash?  But I thought since W went low with W12, I might as well try to build up something outside.


This is simply not a good move:

1. It touches the stones you wanted to attack later, thus makes them stronger.

2. It has little effect on the marked stone.

3. In fuseki (opening) you need to play big moves - this move is slow and if white wants to, he can take sente yet again by answering at [a\] and playing elsewhere (tenuki) regardless of your next move, especially since you played n17 so far from the white stones.


Instead of the move you played I would consider moves [b\], [c\] and [d\], and would probably play [b\] or [c\] - [d\] looks too small and defencive - overconcentrated.

Here is a general advice: if you can not find a good local move, play tenuki (ie. somewhere else).]
;W[fc];B[ed]SL[ci]LB[fd:a]C[Good. As white has played the marked stone to erase your thickness, you would gain little by playing at [a\].]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[hd]SL[fd][fc]C[White markes stones are bad as thay are not needed and really achieve nothing but helped you to gain strenght.]
;B[ge];W[df];B[he]LB[ee:a][id:b]C[Pushing from behind is bad style. Simple connection at [a\] would have been better. You would have had more aji left to toy around here (for example [b\]).]
;W[id];B[ee]SL[df]C[I thought this solid connection would give B some plays against the two stones later.

The solid conection is best here. Alwaystry to be connected. However the push from behind earlier really did not gain you anything :)

Also white will treat the marked stone lightly and will sacrifice it easily without losing anything.]
;W[qi];B[qk];W[qf];B[qe]SL[mc]LB[qd:a]C[This kosumi will of course make white slightly overconcentrated, but it also makes white stronger. Also it does not protect the corner well. Instead a simple play at [a\] is better. Also please notice that since the top white group is already very strong, the marked black stone seems to be one line too close to it leaving the corner a bit thin.]
;W[pf];B[re]LB[me:a]N[Slow move.]C[Instead you should have played at [a\] or one line to the right to go to the center. The less you play to the secnd line in the opening, the better.]
;W[od]C[I didn't see this coming :p


:) Now you will play more and more moves to protect a corner territory that you can not expand in the opening, and that is rarely a good idea :)]
;B[oc];W[pe];B[nd]SL[qe]LB[qd:a]C[Decided to stick my head out at the expense of losing two stones.

My Comment: This is a bad move. As you will lose lots of points in the corner _and_ make white very thick and secure. Please compare this to what would have happened had you just played at [a\] instead of the marked stone in the first place.

Also, even if you make a ponnuki by eating the lone white stone at some point, it will be both gote and small.]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[rd];B[rc];W[rf];B[qc];W[se];B[cn]SL[ci][df]LB[ck:a]
[fq:b][cl:c]C[In retrospect, perhaps this should be at somewhere like c9 or c8 to put pressure on the two stone-group first?  That would seem to be more consistent with B23?   C9 ([a\]) would have been better since it attacks the marked stones using your wall upstairs. You will not be able to harm the group much, but you will probably end up building some thickness and after that play the other kakari (aproach move) against this corner ([b\]).

If white gets to play at [c\], it is hard to find much use for the black wall on top left.]
;W[cl];B[cq]C[With W42, there doesn't seem to be any point in trying to jump out to E6, so chose corner instead.


Indeed it is hard for black to find a good move locally.I can not criticize the move you played as corner is alway going to be big and you can still use the wall on top left to reduce the white moyo (territorial framework - I am sorry if I translate too much :)

Another (not necessarily better) idea would have been to play a double approach move and treat the original approach move lightly. Hmm, after thinking a bit more, I think black proably should actually have played a double kakari.]

(;W[cp]C[Wouldn't it be better for W to press on the other side?


Whites idea is to build a moyo on the left hand side. Had white played on the ither side, whites potential on the left hand side would have reduced and as black would gain sente, white would fail to gain much on the bottom of the board - see other variation.]
;B[dq];W[eq]N[An overplay]C[This is a trick move.]BM[1];B[bp]
LB[bq:a][ep:b]C[The most common way of countering the trick is to simply play [a\] instead. White answers by playing where you played in the game, and then black can safely cut at [b\] because the three white stones are lacking liberties. Black would get a very nice result.]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[er]SL[bo][co][cp][dp]C[And black has managed to get a tricked :)
Insterad of this move a cut might still have worked better because of b6 which takes away liberties from the marked white stones.]
;W[fq];B[fr];W[gq]C[Felt this was ok.  W doesn't have any prospect on the lower side, and his position on the left is rather flat.

This is bad result for black locally. White is very thick now.]
;B[el]LB[ei:a][dj:b][bn:c][pl:d][pn:e]C[Is there a better move?    A: Yes :)

This is too cose to the white wall. Never play close to thickness, no matter if it is yours or your opponents.

An example of a better reducing move here is the other cap at [a\], or [b\], which is the reducing move I probably would have played. The virtue of [a\] is that it also builds framework for black by using the wall, although there is not much potential left for black in the center.

The move you played looks like an isolated island in the middle of white sea.

Anyhow, before any reducing moves you could haveplayed at [c\] just to see how your opponent answers, and then reduced.


Also notice that white can play [d-e\] combination at anytime to create more moyo potential and attack strenght in the center.]
;W[dm]LB[hl:a][ei:b]C[White plays a very bad move. Now your stone can escape. As black, I would probably play around [a\] and later try to play around [b\] to form a framework.]
;B[ei]LB[pl:a][pn:b]C[escaping is a good idea, but as white still has the [a-b\] combination to build moyo in the center, I think you should have jumped the other way. This is howevwer a far better move that your original suicide move :)]
;W[dh]C[Small.];B[em]LB[hl:a][gh:b]C[I would not have played this move as it seems slow. However, it does create some aji. The danger is now that your stones will become heave and under attack. Anyhow, it is hard to find the right move, yet I feel the two black stones need some reinforcement - I would probably have played around [a\] or at [b\].]
;W[en];B[fn];W[eo];B[dk];W[ck];B[fh]C[Felt rather good to have pressed w so low beneath a thick b wall, with the back door open on top.


You did get a nice result locally as white is rather overconcentrated. However white co-operated with you nicely :)]
;W[gl];B[gk]LB[gm:a]C[A simple connection just felt too submissive.  But I'm not sure whether B67 is any good.


Nothing wrong with [a\], it would also reduce white prospects on the lower side. No need to create complications as you seem to be leading slightly.

Also, the move you played looks "odd". Playing the simple move would also weaken the white stone a lot more - now white gets more momentum and options.

Actually I would even say that [a\] is the only possible move in this position.]
;W[dj];B[hl]C[Good - no need to answer to opponents bad gote moves .)]
;W[gm];B[hm];W[gn]LB[fk:a][hk:b]C[This result doesn't seem to be too bad for B?

A: There are problems with this position. First, if white plays [a\], you sacrifice a lot needlessly (compared to if you had conected properly earlier on), and second, there is a severe cut at [b\] left. You just can not leave cutting points like this lying around.]
;B[pi]SL[dk][el][em][fn]LB[ij:a][pj:b][qj:c][pk:d][pl:e][pn:f]
[qq:g]C[Maybe should've pressed down one more on H6?

You mean: "pushed one more step from behind"? Locally I would have connected at [a\] and cried a bit about the (potentially) sacrificed marked stones. If you sacrifice something, you also should gain something - now you only gained a cutting point in your shape.

Back to the move you played: it is not a good idea for several reasons:

1. You try to make territory the hard way - in the center, yet white will gain sente and can for example jump at [a\].

2. Your opponent is 2 stones stronger than you, and if he cuts at [b\] (the ladder is good for him), or even more evil fashion, plays W[c\] B[b\] W[d\] -combination, you will be in trouble as white is solid on the side.

3. If you want to make a moyo on the center, you probably should first prewent white from pressign you down with [e-f\] combination.

4. The corner move [g\] is the biggest point on the board.]
;W[qj];B[pj];W[rk]C[White lets you off the hook. The cut was the only move for him.]
;B[rl]LB[pk:a]N[Dubious move.]C[What if white cuts at [a\]?
Territorially speaking, all these moves are rather small compared to for example the bottom right corner.]
;W[ql];B[pk];W[rj];B[qm]C[Erh....IGS went down, and came back up.  I logged back on first.  Didn't seem my opponent.  Then he loaded the game while I was reading my e-mail, so I was running out of time when I had to play this sequence....Then he added 5 minutes for me :o

This definitely had to be q8, right?


A: Yes :) However,....];W[pl];B[ol];W[pm]LB[on:a][rm:b]N[...try this]
C[A standard fencing-in move is proper here: just play [a\]. White has no choice but to play [b\].]
;B[om]C[Felt there was no choice but to temporarily give up the right side stones....


Pushind from behind is most of the time a bad idea. A one-space jump would have been better. ("ikken-tobi is never bad")]
;W[pn];B[on];W[po];B[og]LB[jf:a][km:b][jk:c][mh:d][qq:e]C[Big question mark.

Which alternative is best?  Or is there somewhere else B should play now?


This is consistent with your play to make terrotory out of the center and locally probably the best move. White can jump to [a\], but using complicated fighting you should be avble to stop him there starting perhaps with the point above [a\]. Although the more I think about it, the more I prefer playing [a\] instead of the move you played.

[c\] would be a move wasted as the cutting point is no longer that critical because black is thick on the right hand side of the board.

I would have played simply at [e\] for a couple of reasons: it is very big abd if white plays there, it is absolute sente against the stones on the side.

I call moves like [e\] "double territory moves" as its territorial value is about twice what one first thinks - if white plays there, he gets lots of points and black gets zero, and vice versa.]
;W[hk]C[This cut is dangerous for white now as black is thick all over the board. Instead white shouild have played in the corner.]
;B[ik]LB[il:a][jl:b]C[The problem with playing ataris is that they tend to strenghten your opponent more than you - you created a cutting point at [a\]. [b\] is a move with better style.]
;W[hj];B[ij]C[Pushing from behind again, arent were :)];W[gj]
;B[fk];W[il];B[im];W[jl];B[jm]LB[ii:a]C[YOu could also have played at [a\].]
;W[ii];B[jj];W[ji];B[kj]LB[kl:a]C[Better to play more solid way - take the two white cuttng stones and becme thick by playing [a\] instead.]
;W[hh];B[fj]LB[lh:a][jf:b][fg:c]C[This was too slack.  Should've attacked more forcefully at a or b?


[b\] is the only attacking move (disconnects white totally and drives towards your thickness).

However if you play [b\], white can play [c\] and kill the tail (unless I misread something). So actually your move was not that bad, but instead probnably the best move locally :)]
;W[jf];B[qq]C[Is there still some way for B to put some more pressure on W's center group now?

Couldn't think of any, so decided to get some territorial balance by living the LR corner....Please comment on how B managed to live here.  Is there a better way?



--
The marked w stone is in the critical point for both sides and removes all the weaknesses from white.

Anyhow the move you played was long overdue and locally the only move. :) White really should have played it earlier on as it was absolutely sente against your stones on the side.]
;W[ro]SL[qn][qm]LB[rn:a]C[If you want to save the marked stones, play at [a\], howevere, they are small and you could instead play the variation which is a better way to live in the corner.]

(;B[rr];W[qp];B[so];W[sn];B[sp];W[rm];B[or]C[Seems Q2 would've been better.

A: yes, and the variation presented earlier agin much better. You wasted some aji and got gote.]
;W[nr];B[pr];W[be];B[bd];W[mn]SL[il][jl]C[W probably had the idea of activating the marked stones as you did not properly capture them. However, the move seems quite thin. One line to left seems a bit better. What white does not want to do however is provoking you to kill them marked stones.]

A: This move seems a bit thin. Instead white just might have been able to pull the marked stones out now and tried to kill the stnes above them. Perhaps. Anyhow, I thnk both sides got a bit carried away with willingnes to fight. White probably did lose more than black though.]
;B[lm];W[lo];B[mm];W[ki]
(;B[lj]C[Too timid to hane at M11.  But perhaps that wouldn't be so bad, even if W cuts.

;W[bn];B[oo]C[This is almost a dame.];W[pq];B[mg]LB[eb:a]C[Pointless struggle here. The points that are left on the board are all slow to the sides of the board now. Like for example [a\], which is also practically sente because of g18.]

;W[lb];B[mb];W[lc];B[of]LB[fm:a][lr:b]C[Should've been at N14....?


A: Why? :) You can reduce the center from several points anyhow. I am not saying that the move you played was good, because it was not :)

There are several bigger moves on the board left, a couple on the top left, and for example [a\] seems nasty. Also someone shouldplay around [b\] because if black does not make an eye here he will lose lots of points because lots of points near the g1-stone will turn out to be dames.]

A: By not defendng b loses 4 points in the corner. And c17 would have been bad, simple d19 is better. By playing here, white loses about the same, so this is ok. You can not keep defending all the time - games are lost in endgame if one just defend, so this move shows a positive approach.]
