C[DanielTom (DT) - Hello, D'mitri. I'm the reviewer - my comments will start with DT.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc]LB[pj:A]TR[qd]C[DT - The aim of this opening for Black, after the shimari (marked), is to extend at A to make a really nice moyo that works well Black's stones. White should, of course, avoid this.]
(;W[nq]LB[qj:A]C[DT - This is probably the wrong direction. A instead is standard (see variation).]
(;B[kq]LB[pn:A]TR[dp]C[I think Q6 or R6 was good enough.  I looked on smartgo and saw no progames with a pincer for this opening.

DT - As I explained earlier, the right side is the most important part of the board right now, so you should be happy to play there (see variation). So this pincer is the wrong direction.
Please note: one important step to improve is to understand when to pincer, or which joseki to choose. Just because you can pincer, that doesn't mean it is a good move in all positions (that is the magic of Go). In this case, because of the marked stone and considering your shimari at the top, a pincer here doesn't make much sense.]
;W[qq]LB[qn:A]C[DT - White could also think about A, but the move in the game is OK - simple and effective.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn]LB[kq:A]SQ[oc]
[qd]C[DT - White is happy with this result because now your marked stones lost their influence.
Another thing you should notice is that your group at the bottom is not stable yet because the A stone is far away - so you still need to spend a move here.
The important thing to have in mind is that because of your pincer White got a position at the right side and made your marked stones lose their meaning, while you got a position at the bottom which is not really interesting...]
;B[cf]LB[hq:A]C[Would this be better at H3 or G3 because I think W can play H3 an be happy.

DT - Yes. As I said, Black still needs a move around A.];W[ch]
;B[fd];W[df];B[dg]
(;W[ce]C[I know the standard Joseki sequence but white must have not known.

DT - Yes - this is not a joseki.]
(;B[ef]LB[cg:A]C[DT - Good move. Black A instead would be just what White wants.]
;W[de];B[cg]C[DT - White is punished.];W[eg]
(;B[eh]LB[dh:A]C[DT - A instead is probably better.];W[fg];B[dh]
LB[fg:2][dh:3][eh:1]C[DT - The 1-2 exchange helped White and you still had to go back and connect at 3, so I think you should have played at 3 directly instead of 1.]
;W[fe]C[DT - This is the only move.];B[ge];W[gf];B[he];W[jd]
C[I think that this is too aggressive  for W.

DT - I think it is a good move - it shows good spirit. :)];B[hc]
C[Was this a good counter? I feel good with thickness on both sides of W upper left corner.

DT - This is the vital point.];W[mc]
(;B[ne]LB[jf:A]C[This move feels slack to me now.  I was waiting to see when it would be a good time to exploit the aji of L17.  At the time I was thinking that after this move I could play R8 in sente and chase the the weak group up top while making a moyo in the upper right.

DT - I don't agree with this move either. I think Black should play at A instead - see variation.]
;W[jf]SQ[hc][fd][ge][he]C[DT - This is a good move - now we can see the marked group isn't as strong as you thought :)]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[ql]C[DT - This is very greedy. You still need to defend at the top.]
(;W[qi]LB[jc:A]SQ[ql]C[Was this again too agressive by W? I also considered Getting my H15 group out into the center.

DT - Yes, this was a bad move. White should try to get sente here to play the vital point at A - see variation.
R11, the move in the actual game, was probably the losing move.]
(;B[oj]LB[qf:A][pk:B]C[DT - This move looks very strange to me. White has A to get some eye-space and there is the weakness at B.]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[oh];B[mj]C[Now I tried to make a moyo in the lower right while W fixed his weak group.

DT - Good idea.];W[pj];B[ok];W[pk];B[pl]C[DT - This White's moves were bad - they only made you stronger.]
;W[qk]C[DT - It is very painful for White to live like this.]
;B[rl];W[ol]C[I like this move by W but he never tried to save his cutting stone.

DT - It is not a good move, it's an overplay.];B[pn];W[rk];B[qo]
;W[ro];B[rn]
(;W[so]LB[sp:A]C[DT - A instead would be better.]
(;B[fp]LB[jb:A]C[I knew this game would be a fighting one since my opponent was so agressive so my stategy was to build strength in the center and when he invades, I could play more agressive since I had the advantage.

DT - This is a big move (your moyo is huge), but A is still really urgent.]
(;W[jp]LB[cn:A]C[DT - White has a choice: see variation.];B[jq]
;W[ip]LB[dn:A]C[I think this was slow. I would have played at H4 to make sabaki. This shape seems heavy.

DT - I agree. Anyway, this game is very hard for White now (he doesn't even have time to play A)...]
;B[iq];W[dn]
(;B[fm]LB[fn:A]C[DT - Black A would be more solid.];W[jl]LB[dl:A]
C[DT - This is an overplay (A would be normal) but the game is almost hopeless for White anyway.]
;B[jj]C[DT - Good move.];W[hm];B[ig]LB[hf:A]C[DT - You finally did something about the top side (however, the situation before was a bit different and White could easily cut you at A).]
;W[jb];B[hf];W[cl]LB[fn:A][gn:B]SQ[fm]C[This move looks purely defensive.  He must not have seen the connection at F6.

DT - You are right, there is some aji around A, but White can't really connect (Black would just play B). Now you understand why I said A instead of the marked move would perhaps be better.]
(;B[ci]C[Was this slow?  I don't think I have time to make moves like this.  Would G 6 be better?

DT - Yes, this is slow. Just G8 would be better - see variation.]
;W[dr]
(;B[hk]LB[gl:B][fn:A]TR[fm][fp]C[I was going after the group in the upper left now.

DT - You still have the old shape problem of the marked stones at A, so B instead of your move would be more solid.]
(;W[go]LB[fn:A][go:B]C[I think he should have just connected instead of trying to live inside of my sphere.

DT - White can't connect that easily, but A would be much better than the move in the game - see variations. White B only helps Black, it makes Black stronger for nothing. It is a very bad move.]
;B[fo]TR[jl][hm][go][ip][jp]C[DT - Black is very happy! The game should be about over now, I can't see a way for the marked stones to live.]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[kk];B[hq]C[Phew ^_^];W[kj];B[cc]LB[ki:A]TR[kj]
[kk][jl][hm][go][gp][ip][jp]C[Now I began my assult!

DT - You should hane at A and not let the marked group escape so easily. What were you thinking? You are too kind...]
;W[dc];B[bd];W[be];B[db]C[DT - Good fighting spirit here... :)]
;W[eb];B[bb];W[da];B[cb];W[ec];B[gb];W[ac];B[ad];W[ab];B[ca]
(;W[ea]C[I wonder I why he didn't play A19 and at least try to get a Ko.

DT - This is a strange move. See variation.];B[aa];W[ba]C[DT - No use.]
;B[bc]C[DT - The result is terrible for White. Now the game is really over.]
;W[bh];B[dj];W[gh]
(;B[ih]LB[hi:A]C[Now things when downhill from here. I was afaraid of the H15 group dying ad didn't take the time to read and see if it could be killed.  I also think ths move was to softM initial choice was H11.

DT - Black A would make things much easier indeed :(];W[hi]

C[DT - Excellent. How exciting :)];B[ck]C[I think this was a mistake.

DT - This position is very complicated for Black.];W[dl];B[gi]
C[DT - This doesn't seem to work.];W[gj];B[fi];W[ei];B[fh];W[hh]
;B[di]C[I meant to throw in at G13 first but I got caught up in the moment and played my planned sequence out of order.

DT - Yes, but even with the throw-in you would be in trouble.]
;W[gg];B[bf];W[af];B[ki]C[I decided now that in order to make up for my loss I HAVE to kill one of the big groups to have any chance of winning.

DT - Please note that you could have played here long ago, but you decided to go for the adventure... This could have cost you the game.]
;W[kn];B[in];W[gn];B[fn]
(;W[il]LB[mm:A]C[I don't like this W move because all he has to do is make sure a part of his lives and he wins.

DT - This is a bad move for sure. The position is very complicated, but I think that White can live by playing at A.]
;B[lm]C[DT - Very good!];W[kp];B[ln];W[lo];B[km];W[jm];B[jn]
;W[ko];B[lj]LB[ho:B][hp:A]C[DT - Usually in this kind of shape it is very important to exchange A-B to avoid sekis.]

Thanks for reveiwing my game!  What Should I work on to improve and do you think I am getting close to 1dan? Be honest ^_^. Again, thank you!

DT - I wouldn't resigne as White yet - if he plays a good endgame (starting with A) who knows? "Never resigne!"
I can't tell for sure how strong you are just by looking at one game - I think you still miss very important points of the game (sometimes you focus too much on the local instead of looking at the big picture) but maybe after you read this review you can call yourself a shodan (1d) :)
So let's hope you can improve with this review. To sum up the lessons you can take:

1 - Be more careful about the DIRECTION OF PLAY in the Opening (move 7, pincer at L3); Don't waste the power of your stones;
2 - Never allow to be shut in - and forced to live small and in gote (move 37, O15). Always GET OUT into the center;
3 - Be sure to play the URGENT POINTS first (in this game you missed K18 which was a key point for both to make eye-space);
4 - When possible, play SOLID moves and don't leave weaknesses in your shape (move 77, H9 - should be at G8);
5 - FINISH THE GAME right away when you can, instead of going for non-clear fights (move 85, C17).

Although White wasn't a very strong player, the game was still exciting. In some moves I could see your positive spirit and potential - I think you can easily improve.

Let me end with 2 suggestions: 
- Read (if you haven't yet) Akira Ishida and James Davies' "Attack and Defense" (of the Elementary Go Series) and the famous "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" by Toshiro Kageyama;
- Play many fast games! Give 3 or more stones of handicap to players of your level and try to win (they will probably get irritated and make mistakes - you can win and that will increase your confidence).

I hope this review helped!
I wish you the best.])
