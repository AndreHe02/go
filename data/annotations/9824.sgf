C[Hello,
usually I don't play for influence, but this game I tried, and like always I had no good use for my influence. Exspecially that center oriented influence always gives me headaches. It is just too easy to reduce.
Hope you could give me some ideas as to how I shoud've used it.

Thank you very much for the review!

-Hi there, 

I'm around 2 dan btw, just to give you a rank.

For this game, I think you had the advantage throughout but you weren't sure what to do really. You also had some shape problems and subtle moves which could have greatly helped if you had decided to play it slightly differently. Some of those things seem small at first but add up when in time of need. 

I don't believe you really used your influence as you had quite a few chances to create a moyo but never did. Even then though, I think you were ahead until you decided to play the D9 sequence and how you handled the top left. Those two things were the big odd plays for this game. One thing to keep in mind is when you create a moyo, you don't have to make that into territory, creating a moyo also usually forces your opponent to play inside your influence and make a weak group. At that point, you can decide what you want to do to make a larger advange for yourself.

If you want to ask any more questions, you can always e-mail me! Thanks

;W[rp];B[qq];W[mn]C[At this point I wasn't sure, if I should play R 11 or L3. But I thought if I play L 3 R 8 will come under heavy attack.

-R8 would not be under heavy attack though it might be attacked. That is fine depending on what you want to do. Also, look at your stones, they're all low except Q4. I would think of playing higher whichever side you wanted to play on.]

(;B[qi]C[- This is low and quite slow with your shimari in top right.]

;W[nn];B[kn]C[-This move also I think has the wrong idea. You're pushing white into your influence but for what exactly? White will surely live right now and you could have created a moyo.]
;W[po]
(;B[op];W[rq];B[rr];W[qp];B[qr];W[ok]C[At this point I didn't really know what to do: Just defending seemed to small to me. I was debating about P 11, or trying to cut white off.

-White's group is quite strong right now and the chance of you killing it or doing any damage is slim. Cutting white is a mistake, you need to ask yourself what cutting him off will get you? As in, if you did cut white off, other than trying to kill what can I get?]

(;B[ol]C[I knew that white could seperate P 8, but I thought that is okay, since his S3 group isn't alive yet.

- You can't actually separate P9 though so this move doesn't achieve much.]

(;B[nf];W[of];B[ne];W[oe];B[od];W[sg]C[Now I had a lot of influence, but like always I had no idea how to use it. I read that when you have influence you should attack weak groups, but I didn't see any weak white group on the board, so I just tried to reduce white.

-I think at this point you were much better off than white. White was playing greedy at times and while you didn't fully punish him all the time, you still ended up nicely with the top and white basically being confined. You can use influence for a lot of things like attacking, invading, reducing, etc. For me, your next move accomplishes nothing, white doesnt have territory there, you actually helped white create territory. 

E15 definitely looks like the biggest move right now or if you wanted to see what white did, you coud play C17.]

(;B[dk]C[-This isn't reducing anything, I would have gladly played C9 if you played this actually.]

(;W[dj];B[ck]C[Probably this was a mistake. But I thought since I have all this influence I shouldn't be submitting by jumping away.

-You submitted when you played D9 but this move creates bad shape and weaknesses, you become the weak group and get attacked.]

(;B[kl];W[gh]C[I don't quite understand why white poked here and didn't just disconnect black. But it was enough to win.

-You have a lot of aji there to survive actually. If you had better shape and played J13 instead of H14, white would only have threats I believe. This move helps solve that partially though still not very solidly. He just wants you to trade as well to make it more simple I'm guessing.]

You also have more secure territory vs white and larger influence. I'd say you have the advantage like this.]
