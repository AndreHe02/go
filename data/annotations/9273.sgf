C[Dear reviewer,

I am White in this game and I want to learn about all my mistakes. Despite the horrible amount of mistakes in the endgame, this was a serious game (german league, division 3 on board 1) with one hour maintime each. I would like to learn about Black as well, I found his play highly doubtful at times and would like to know where he could have pushed me harder.]

(;W[qc]
(;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[og]C[tapir: This feels wrong. I wouldn't like to play this as Black.

Indeed. This is completely wrong for black. The wall he just build is going to be useless. This can only be played if Black has a stone around k16. So, you might split black's side now.]
;W[ic];B[kc];W[fc];B[dc];W[ie]C[That feels great for white!]
;B[ke];W[hq]C[I think, this is your first overplay. First of all, It's too far from q4. I will be difficult for you to make points with this move. Also, you are not sure yet whether you want h3 or maybe later you'll prefer to get g5 and combine it with a move around d12 to build a large framework.

So, in my opinion it's too early to play that.];B[gq];W[hp]
;B[nq]LB[lq:A]SQ[hp][hq]C[H3 is too far away. You should consider a pincer, so you can use your stones.]

(;W[oq];B[np];W[pn]
(;B[jp]C[You made black heavy yes. But since h3 is heavy too, you're going to fear the cutting point around g5.]
;W[hn]C[tapir: This is the first move that really felt bad doing, but I had no better idea. I expected L3 and planned to answer L5. Now I feel Like I have to answer, but it is an awkward position for both.

Looks like it's needed, you're still aiming around m3-4, it's calm and good.]
;B[ql]LB[qn:A][lq:B]C[if you want to protect your corner you can play A. You can also think about removing black's base at B.]

(;W[jg];B[dh]C[Black got the last big point. If we count, we'll see the game is still even, and you can still attack o4 group. You have to keep it calm.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]LB[dk:A]C[That was big, but it's gote. Black should play around A which is much bigger.]
;B[nc]C[tapir: I wanted to bring this exchange in sente, before Black gets R18 in sente after all the moves on the right side. My opponent thought this was a mistake in the game discussion.]
;W[cj]LB[cf:1][df:2][dh:B][ei:A]C[tapir: I was very proud of this move, trying to make miai between center territory at A or an attack on black B.

This feels good for white. With this move you aim to invade around 1 and 2. Still, i'm not sure if just d10 was better.]
;B[rn];W[nr];B[mr];W[or];B[lq]C[the corner it's small. You should tenuki!]

(;W[rp]
(;B[ch];W[ei];B[eh];W[fi]C[Yes! Center is really big now!];B[hd]
C[tapir: At this point I counted myself comfortably ahead and would have been happy with a peaceful way to handle the top. Is there any alternative way to handle this completely differently?

You are ahead, indeed, as I told you before, you should just proceed easy and calm. Just giving up is ok now.]

(;W[id];B[jf];W[if];B[ig]
(;W[kg];B[hg]C[this is painful and white is suddenly in trouble.]

(;W[jj]C[tapir: Later in the game I regretted this move. Would have been much better at K11. Maybe simply starting to live at the top is even better here?]

Yes, you lost 8 points here and the game too. No further comments, even you made another mistake at n5, you were losing already anyway.]
