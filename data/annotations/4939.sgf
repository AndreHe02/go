RE[B+Resign]

AB[pd][jj][dp]C[I am Allan and I am playing white in this game.
Need pointers on how to handle games in which I give handicap.
My own comments are marked "al>"
Thanks for taking the time to review this game!

My comment starts with >>  :-) 

>> not the usual 3 handicap stones at the 3 corners. 
I don't like Tengen in handicap game  I dont' know how to handle it.

>>my general advices are 1). In the opening, play lightly, create 1-2 stable groups or extensions, but don't save just every stone. 2). don't make obvious bad plays hoping that black will make mistakes.  You should play moves that you can work out the outcome (assuming black answers correctly, according to your readings, of course).  Black will eventually make mistakes and you  will catch up.  Sometimes white has to overplay but don't do it too much.]
;W[pp]LB[oq:B][pq:A]C[>> you could start with komoku(A) or mokuhazushi (B)   I prefer A/B to the star point.   Because, as white you want to gain territory with each move and star gives no immediate territory.   

Also I feel that a weaker player tends to go wrong with the josekis that follow from A or B, white has many options  , imho]
;B[cd];W[qf]LB[ed:A][ec:B]C[>> i think preventing corner enclosure is more urgent for white.  black's play there will give him somewhat sure territory.]
;B[fc];W[nc];B[oe];W[qc];B[pc]
(;W[pb]LB[qd:A]C[>> this move is normally played at A];B[ob]
;W[qb];B[oc];W[nb]C[al> Normally, I wouldn't play O18 here, but I feel stressed by the fact that I am so far behind. I was pondering a play around J17 as well, and in hindsight I have a feeling that it is better, as white, to sort sprinkle stones all over the place to create aji, rather than to get locked up in local situations.

>> imho, i think o18 is using the aji , not creating one.   

>> don't panic at this point , it's very early in the game.  white will usually see the victory near the end of a handicap game.   

>>  q18 is normally played at r16.  and white will have a safe group on the right.  you can use o18 aji later in the game.]
;B[oa];W[lb];B[ic];W[me]C[al> At this point I thought that I would save my group by attacking the black group. 

>> but... in the game white ended up with 3 seperate not-completely-safe groups  so this is doubtful.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[og];W[ph];B[re];W[sc];B[qe];W[qg]C[>> this is very very small, you don't save the stones like r14

>>it is a ko to kill white in the corner so you should keep that in mind.  see the sequence.  let's hope that black doesn't know this sequence :-)]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[cj];B[cn];W[jq];B[pk]TR[ph][qg][qf]C[>> r13 made the marked group  heavy for you so you want to safe them. otherwise it will feel that you wasted one move to play r13.  
But I just want to give them up and play r6/r7  or some where around that area to make your bottom corner. 

>>ther may be a chance to rescue them later in the game.];W[oj]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[pl];W[qm];B[pm];W[pn];B[po];W[on];B[qp]C[al> Corner or side?  I was afraid I would lose the rest of the stones along the right side if I went for the corner.

>> problem started with p10,  I agree you 'd lose more if you save corner.]

;W[gq];B[eq];W[go]C[>>  i would be tempted to ignore E3 and play in the top moyo , thinking that black probably won't find good attacking move here.]
;B[if];W[jf]TR[bd][cc][dc][ec][ne][nd][oe][og][pd][pc][oc][ob]
[oa][qd][qe][re]C[al> Here I was trying to do something about the top left corner. My thought was that contact play with the J14 stone would create opportunities on the back side of it - I think.. Maybe just reducing with C13 would be good enough? I didn't play C13 because I guessed that it would on ly reinforce black's corner.

>> remember that on the other side black is strong, white will have tough time fighting.  A play in corner directly could be  an option though.  You could live or have some aji but  i don't know where to play :-)

>> .it'd be nice to create  some thickness towards black's marked group  .because  if white q14 then black lose the eyes]

C[>. i];B[dg]MA[he][fe][ie]C[>> i don't like saving  J15  you lost opportunity on the top right  and white top group(M18) is now in danger  
>>while running black gets territory, white gets none]
(;W[gh]CR[gg]C[>>make shape with g13 might be better];B[gg]
;W[gf];B[hg]
(;W[fg]C[al> how about E13 instead? I am out of my depth here, as it is not just about trying to keep my groups alive, but also to reduce as much as possible of black's potential territory.
 
>>it should be f13 , wasn't that why you played g14?];B[ef]

;W[ld];B[le];W[kc];B[ff]TR[fe][gf][he][ie]C[>> now it got captured anyway :-)  in a grander scale.   Also a chance in the top left corner is gone :-)]
;W[ji]C[al> After been cut by F14, creating a moyo in the center seemed like my only option. 

>> it's not enough now  black can reduce it from many directions.  next time if you want center moyo, include it in your plan  since the begining :-)]

>> black should be ok :-)

>>in handicap game white should be subtle and not play so obvious moves.  keep black weak.  

>> you should be more consistent. your moves should work  with the previous moves not hurting them.
