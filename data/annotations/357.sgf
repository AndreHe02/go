(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]VW[]C[Some genaral comments:

Do not make blind invasions: Look, if they are reasonable and if there is a continuation.

Try to look some moves ahead in critical situations. If you put stones on the board, that do nothing but being captured, you are helping your opponent to much.

Do not save allways try to save all your stones. Do give one or two stones away and make profit, by threataning to link them up or something else.]

;W[ec]LB[ed:a]C[This move schould be at A. There is no good possibility for Black, to invade your corner.]
;B[ed];W[dc];B[he];W[jd]C[Good. Your territory grows faster than blacks.]
;B[jp];W[qo];B[qp];W[pl];B[jj];W[pg]LB[dn:a]C[I would make an invasion around A. Your position at the right is a bit overconcentrated now.]

;W[gb];B[ge];W[fb];B[ib];W[dn]TR[hc][ib]C[The marked stones can only live at a very small scale. Tenuki (Playing elsewhere) is a good idea.]
;B[fp];W[dl];B[cl];W[cm];B[ck];W[cq]LB[co:a][cp:b]C[Probably better at A. If Black plays B, you have a problem, if you want to save both groups. But you are lucky.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[cr];W[do];B[bq]C[Bad move, because it is gote for black.]
;W[bp];B[br];W[ch]LB[mc:a]C[That is an overplay, I think. You have a lead on the board, play simple moves, like A, and be happy with your sente invasion.]
;B[dh]C[The only move...];W[df];B[de];W[ce];B[ef]LB[dg:a]C[If Black had played A, the ladder had worked directly...]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[eg];B[fg];W[eh];B[ei];W[di];B[fh];W[dh];B[bh]C[... But so your stones are dead anyway. I have no good alternative. The first stone played there, might be the wrong one.]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[be];B[bc]TR[bc]LB[bd:a]C[A will kill the marked stone (see variation).]

;W[eb];B[kb];W[mc]LB[lc:a]C[Better on A. If Black plays A, there is no easy continuation for you. Black can live there on a small scale anyway, but you will have a solid outer wall.]

If black saves his endangered stone, you can play B, threatening C, so it is sente. After that you can think of an invasion at the lower side, which is quite open.]

;B[km]LB[on:a]C[Serious mistake from black. If he plays simply a, there is still no way for you, making two eyes. You exploited his mistake quite good, even if it had not worked. Look at the variation. I think it does its job.]

 justinP 30k : I resign, Ishould of ages ago, thanks for the game it was fun.

This decision is right anyway. But the invasion, Black played, could be answered by you at A, B or C, where A is the best, I think. It is clearly an overplay.]
