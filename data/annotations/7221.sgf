C[Hallo...and thank you very much for reviewing my game. I appreciate your effort.

This will be a short review since I wanna focus on two certain aspects where I also have questions. I would like if you focus on these two issues. If you see other heavy/obvious mistakes, of course, I'd thank you if you could point it out. Please keep in mind that my basic strategy is solid and territorial-oriented.

CGBSpender [-\]: After having a look at this game and your precision about the territorial style, I think i will have to comment on some things which you haven't asked for details. I won't show uncountable and hardly understandable  variations for those, but i will give you the principles.

Things to remember : 

 * Reduce a moyo by playing right in the middle of the border. ( midgame )

* You can't hope for a successful invasion/reduction when you offer your opponent 2 targets. ( J3+ reduction move were split )

* Try to anticipate moyos by not getting sealed ( fuseki sequence in top left )

* In games of influence, the center is the most important part of the game, be careful not to play too slow moves ( top right Q18 )]

(;B[pb]C[rs220675: Here is my first question: Is this move at Q18 alright or too small? I was pretty aware of the white moyo but I thought I cash in some territory since White can't enclose his moyo with one move and since I like a territory-oriented-style. But I see a problem when White would answer at P18, because then Black needs to answer on a very small scale to keep his corner untouched...therefore I don't know if Q18 is a good move at this point.

I would not play it, it feels definitely slow.  white can still reduce, starting with Q12.  I would play Q12 myself.]
;W[ge];B[cb];W[nj]TR[jl][en]C[rs220675: Here I felt I need to reduce the moyo. But generally I have a very hard time to find the right timing, techniques and places where and how to reduce a moyo...and here I also sucked again. I know that comes with praticing, but maybe you can point out some mistakes and show me some variations I could have played here. By the way: I still think that the game is at least even for Black at this very point - do you agree?

CGBSpender [-\]: Two principles that you have to remember when you decide to reduce a moyo : 

CGBSpender [-\]: 1/ if your opponent has a weak group somewhere, chase him back to his area, so you will reduce it at the same time

CGBSpender [-\]: 2/ if that's not the case, try to find the border of the moyo and play right in the middle of it

CGBSpender [-\]: here, the border is shown by the triangle stones, playing right in the middle of that line is where black should invade in theory.

CGBSpender [-\]: As for the timing :  A reduction / Invasion is almost always likely to become a target. Therefore it's a wrong timing to invade/reduce when you have another weak group on the board. That would create two weak groups of yours which could possibly be attacked simultaneously.

CGBSpender [-\]: Here, i would be tempted to defend first around M4 before invading/ reducing.]

;W[in];B[hn];W[hm]
(;B[kn];W[jp]C[CGBSpender [-\]: White is precisely using the weakness of the bottom stone to punish what seems to be a wrong-timed reduction. So i guess protecting around M4 earlier would have been a better choice indeed.]
