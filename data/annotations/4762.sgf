C[forfun (ff hereafter) - This is an interesting game.  Both players showed a lot of energy and initiative.  In the best tradition of amateur Go, not all of it worked as expected :-)

White helped Black in several key areas of the board by trying speculative plays that had to be abandoned later.  This was especially striking in the upper right corner and the lower right corner.

Black, on the other hand, showed a tendency to overestimate the oportunities on the board.  In particular Black did not sufficiently take into consideration the weaknesses in Black's own positions in evaluating the game.  I thought this was apparent in some of the decisions by Black in the early going and also in the later game in the middle right when Black created cutting points in his own position that White then exploited.  This is a big issue for all of us when we are striving to improve our game.  It is necessary to maintain a sense of balance otherwise we throw away to many favorable games by overextending ourselves when it is not necessary.  This is difficult to do properly because evaluating our weaknesses when we think we are doing well is not "fun", rather the opposite.  But to not do so means that we too often underestimate our opponents.  Since our opponents have just as much pride in their skill as we have in ours, they are all too often eager to show us our mistakes.  I myself have had the misfortune to play against all too many of these uncooperative opponents who do not have the good grace to recognise my superior play but rather grab onto some minor oversight of mine and proceed to ruin my day :-)]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[qn];B[cp];W[ep];B[hq]C[ff - This is an unusual pincer attempt against the high approach.  The only low pincer used by professionals is the 1-space pincer at G1.  That has the special feature of threatening to connect underneath by attaching at E1.  More distant pincers such as H3 or J3 are too low to put significant pressure on the high approach stone.  In addition, in this case the stone at Q3 is low and Black runs a risk of ending up too low along the bottom.]
;W[fo]C[ff - White seems to confuse the situation with the 1-space pincer and plays a stone designed to prevent a connection (via E3) that can not happen.  D6 would be much more natural here.]
;B[qp];W[qk];B[kp]C[ff - This is a slow play that achieves very little.  It would be much more natural to play D6 or C7 here.  White can not do much against the H3 stone.  The bottom side has limited potential with the Q3 stone in place.  If the Q3 stone were high, at P4 for example, then L4 would look great.  In this case, however, There is still enough room for White to easily invade (or reduce) the bottom side.]
;W[cn]
(;B[cf]LB[cf:A][dq:B]C[I think I could survive inside (at the expense of sente plus a thick outside white position), but I thought that I could get more profit by either reducing the corner later, or use the aji

An opinion ?

ff - Black is too optimistic in my opinion.  White's stone at C6 is a good double-purpose play that threatens the corner and also combines well with the White stone in the upper left.  Now Black offers a second stone that will inevitably come under attack within White's sphere of influence.  This is not good for Black.  Black should probably have played C11 and then waited to see how White would play.  See the variations...]
;W[ch]C[ff - This is the natural follow through to White's previous play at C6.]
;B[cc]C[because of c4 aji, I though that a white moyo would be not so hard to invade later

Also, playing at E14 would give some outside thickness, but because of F5 and F16 (played trhough the sequence), I thought the trade not interesting.

ff - Basically Black seems to be expecting that all the aji will work in Black's favor.  This seems to be overly optimistic at this point.  In fact White is much more likely to benefit from the relationships here than Black:

- If Black reduces the left side moyo, then White will naturally absorb the bottom left corner on a larger scale than the territory that Black will now build in the upper left.

- If Black lives in the lower left, then naturally White's moyo will be strengthened and Black's bottom side will be weakened and subject to attack.

Basically the Black stones are far apart and can not easily help each other.  The White stones are better coordinated and White should naturally benefit in the future fighting.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc];W[mp]
(;B[fr]C[ff - This should be a slide all the way to E2.  Here White easily seals up the corner while Black makes an over-concentrated position.  See the variation...]
;W[er];B[fq];W[eq];B[mn]C[the idea here is to create centre thickness to aim at the white moyo

ff - If Black wants to build thickness, the natural approach would be to play M6 or so to push White to the right.  Unfortunately this would force White to connect the N4 stone to the right side - which is exactly what White wants to do anyway.  The approach here of sacrificing N6 does not work so well either.  Partly the problem here is that Black's original position is low.  Therefore when White plays high at N4, it is not easy to pressure this stone.  Black should want to keep the invader separated from the right side.  However, Black's bottom side group is not settled yet so White will have various counter chances in any fighting.]
;W[lo];B[ko];W[ln];B[jm];W[mm]C[ff - This exchange makes White thicker than Black.]
;B[mq]C[I had read a profitable sequence, but I misplayed it

ff - I think that Black is hoping for too much here.  White can come out well with normal plays.  In fact, Black is struggling here.  White played N4 to reduce the bottom side.  There is no "profitable sequence" that includes Black being cut in two or pushed down to connect along the bottom.  White's reduction has been a big success.]

;W[np];B[or]
(;W[nr]C[ff - I think that N2 is another possibility...];B[mr]

(;W[ms]C[ff - This is an odd play because it settles Black's shape on the bottom side and leaves Black the play at P1 in the corner.]
;B[kr]
(;W[qr]C[ff - This does not seem to work because P1 threatens to connect.  White should have just played S5?]
;B[os];W[ns];B[rq];W[rr]C[ff - White just gives Black points.]
;B[ro];W[rn];B[po];W[pn]
(;B[di]C[ff - Black plays first on the left but then White plays various forcing moves in the lower left corner.  Perhaps Black should have continued at P5 first...

There is a question whether Black should have started on the left with this play.  It is a natural play against the upper left formation.  However, the key point on the left side is C8 because of the threat to attach underneath at B6.  This virtually forces White to answer from the bottom...]
;W[oq];B[pr];W[oo];B[sr]
(;W[so]C[ff - At least White should have played R5...];B[sp]
;W[sn];B[qo];W[fd]
(;B[cl]LB[gc:B][cl:A]C[because if white plays E17, I live in the corner, and white ends gote

But may be I should have played g17 ?
Looking at it in the variation, I can't find a good attack by white on D11 (maybe white D9)...

what is your opinion ?

ff - Because of the gap at D5, this play is a powerful threat.  However, the threat can be used later as well.  With C8 as a potential play and K7 already on the board, I agree that there is no very strong attack on D11.  The idea of D9 is interesting - patching the gap at D5 from a distance.  However, it does not really threaten D11.]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[db];W[gc]
(;B[oc]C[ff - I think this move is the question mark.  If Black needs this play to remain in the game, then C8 was a poor idea because it was too slow.  White played tenuki from C8 in order to push through at E17.  If Black can not play B6 now, then Black should have answered F16 at G17 and left the corner aji for later.]

(;W[ci]C[ff - Answering D11 locally is not urgent now.  The White stones in the upper left are so strong that any additional plays around here are wasted.  This is White's chance to deal with the lower left corner...]
;B[dk]C[D10 ?

ff - I think B6 is the urgent play...]
(;W[dj];B[ej];W[cj]C[ff - From the direction of the very strong White stones at the top, White has now played three low stones (C11, D10, and C10), "forcing" Black to add E10 and E9.  This does essentially nothing for White and helps Black.  The prospective White moyo on the left side is gone.  Meanwhile the lower left corner is open to attack.]
;B[bn]C[ff - Black puts White on the spot.]

ff - Either way White should have answered on the right side.  There is nothing left to attack in the center.]
;W[jj];B[jk];W[mk]C[ff - Almost a wasted stone, played next to a very strong Black wall.  Black shows better judgement than White by extended down the right side next.]
;B[qg]C[ff - Both sides are strong so a narrow extension makes sense.]
;W[lc];B[md]

;B[of];W[ne];B[nd];W[ss];B[rs];W[ng];B[oe]C[I thought I was slighly ahead, and I would not want to risk a cut here.]
;W[km]C[I was very angry here at myself, but I don't know when there was a good timing before to play M7

ff - Neither this White play nor Black's M7 are central to the game.  Black should be very happy that White gave up sente in order to play here.  This is almost a pass by White.  Realize that if Black had managed to exchange M7 for N5 earlier, White could not have continued around here and would undoubtedly have played next in the center. :-)]

(;B[mh]LB[lg:B][mh:A]TR[jd]C[I hesitated with K16 or M13

I think K16 is more powerful

ff - The important thing to appreciate here is that the three White stones have no meaning except as six points of territory.  They are not cutting stones and have no eye shape.  They are a pure liability that White has played in the middle of Black's strength and then abandoned.  Black should be interest in the upper side White territory.  I think that Black should play in as far as L14 which threatens K16 next.  At the same time Black starts to surround the threeWhite stones on a larger scale.  If White pulls out the three stones, Black is happy to make a few more threatening plays along the way and then reduce the top.

Invading directly at K16 is probably an overplay.  White is very strong in the upper left after capturing the stone at F17.  If Black goes in to K16, White will be happy to lean on the invader and push it toward the thickness in the upper left.  The game will then depend on the ability of the Black stone to survive.  There is no need to risk the game at this point.]
;W[nh];B[mi];W[ni];B[nj]C[ff - Unnecessarily violent.  Black creates weaknesses in Black's own position.]
;W[mj];B[oj];W[lg];B[ki];W[lf]C[ff - This is a very disappointing result for Black.  The original useless three White stones have been transformed into strong, strategic cutting stones due to Black overplays.  Meanwhile Black has created new weaknesses for White to aim at.]
;B[om]C[ff - Black forces White to fix a defect in the White position.  This has to be considered a "Thank you" move that is better left unplayed.]
;W[on];B[nl];W[ml];B[jg]TR[je]C[I think k15 was more appropriate

ff - K15 looks only at the M15 gap in White's position (again forcing White to repair a defect), without considering the weakness of the resulting Black position.  Fundamentally White has strong positions at the top.  Black should not want (or expect) to completely reduce the top.  Rather Black should want to make a reasonable reduction while making some territory (not to mention eyes) in the center.]
