C[This is a game I played recently on KGS where I was playing black and lost by 1.5 points.
I'm looking for general advice on my weaknesses and mistakes I made in this game.
I feel like I'm particularily weak in the late midgame and endgame. I also added some comments with specific questions at a few points.
Thank you for reviewing my game!

MR: I entered comments starting with "MR:" whereever I felt apropriate.

There are some off-topic moves in the early middle game that make the fights more difficult for you. In the late middle game and the end game there are some tactical mistakes that finally cause you loosing the game.

(;B[jd]C[Is this tenuki okay?
My reasoning was that my group on the left will easily live and K16 creates a double wing for me and also prevents an extension from whites wall.

MR: If you want to play on the top, I would prevere something like O17 or N17.]

;W[nc];B[oc]C[In retrospect this felt wrong. He gets too much pressure on my lone K16 stone. However I didn't know what else to play. Is there a good pincer maybe?

MR: I agree that K16 feels lonely after the joseki. But this is just another argument for playing closer to the black corner instead of K16 to begin with.]

;B[qq]C[Should I play this invasion or rather play S4? The invasion hurts my left side, but I destroy his corner territory. When is the right timing to play here?

MR: The invasion is find, the timing is also fine, just the continuation is wrong.]

(;B[pq]C[MR: Should be at S4. This way you are strengthening white and weakening your stones P6 / R6.]

(;B[pk]C[MR: ?];W[qm];B[rl];W[rm];B[nk];W[mj];B[mk]C[MR: What is the reason for this move? You are weakening your center stones, so better play with the center group directly. If white pushes at N9, he is just driving you towards P6.]
;W[lj];B[ho]C[MR: I would prefer to strengthen the center group.]
;W[hg]C[I didn't know what to do with this move and the following peeps. I think I lose a lot with the next few moves. What's better?

MR: Running away with K10 is fine. For the continuation, more flexibility - leaving the aji / endgame for later - would be better.]

(;B[fn]C[MR: Black should play A14 in sente. After that, I would want to try L4 to utilize the aji there. Locally, B7 is better.]
;W[bl];B[bm];W[am];B[an];W[al];B[bo];W[af]C[When he played here in sente I was wondering if I should have played there in sente myself earlier. What would have been a good time to play there if at all?

MR: Yes, you should have played there earlier. See comment at the black move F6.]
;B[ag];W[os];B[rs];W[ko]
(;B[nm]C[This was a mistake. I thought I could connect, but I was wrong. Or is there some tesuji that works?

MR: N7 is one other variation. However, the white group will not be cut off then, so N10 etc. will not be captured. I think that this is not the decisive question with respect to this game.]
