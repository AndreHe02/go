C[Hi barakameek, my name's Josh.  I'll be the reviewer for your game.  I am 2 kyu on KGS and play as Kashomon.  I'll mostly focus on your (that is white's) game, but I'll supply some comments for black as well.  Since you submitted the review, I'll refer to you as 'you' and Holden as 'black'

In general, I think most of the improvements I suggest making concern shape.  Also, I identified some moves I thought were slow, which could be improved by tenuki-ing.  Lastly, I would suggest spending some time to think about when to attack and whether specific attacks work before the attacks are made.  For example, the white stones in the top-middle could have been abandoned much sooner.]

(;B[ne]C[Josh: Yikes!  Not good for black at all.  It's as if black is forcing you to separate.]
;W[me];B[le];W[mf];B[nb]
(;W[nc]C[Josh:  This isn't the right way.  Just moving down to separate is -much- better (see variation).  This let's black solidify.]
;B[mb];W[oc];B[ob];W[pd];B[og];W[of];B[lf];W[qn];B[qk]C[Josh:  A little bit of an overplay for black, I think -- especially with all your thickness.]

(;W[qi]LB[qn:A]C[Josh:  This extension is too cramped.  You want to push toward your thickness.  By playing this way, you hurt (A).]
;B[ok];W[qq]LB[on:A]C[Josh: Looks like a good choice.  Neither of black's options look particularly appetizing.  On the other hand, Black has the chance to make a vast moyo.  Perhaps going at A would have been better?]

(;B[pq];W[qp]
(;B[on];W[ng]C[Josh: Seems like the right way to get rid of that aji, but this move is way too slow. Black has a chance for an epic moyo on the bottom side.]

(;B[mq]C[Josh: Ack.  Rather cramped for black.]
(;W[pl];B[pk];W[po];B[oo]LB[ol:A][qm:B]SQ[pl][po]C[Josh: These two marked moves are aji-keshi.  They remove black's weakesses and get you very little.  The cut at (A) would be nice for you, but doesn't work very well since black has a follow up at (B).]

(;W[pr]
(;B[oq];W[cn];B[fq]LB[en:A]C[Josh: I think you have the chance to really inhibit black's moyo by playing at A, but it's a rather new joseki and I can't speak to it's merits.]

(;W[bp];B[cq];W[ck];B[gc]
(;W[fc]LB[ec:A]SQ[ic]C[Josh: This is not a good move.  Contacting only makes stones stronger -- and in this case making black stronger is not very good!  It both leaves the corner open and hurts the marked stone.  There are several better variations.  (A) defends the corner much better

In any case, this sort of move should be avoided.];B[gd];W[df]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[dh]
(;W[cc]LB[ff:A]SQ[gc][gd][ch][dh]C[Josh: I'm not sure if this move is needed.  It looks like black has several good moves for reducing the corner, though.  Don't worry about the variations too much -- they were mostly because I was curious.  A better move might have been to go at A and attack the two marked groups of stones.   At the very least, your move looks a little bit slow.]
;B[fm]
(;W[hq]LB[fk:A][jm:B]C[Josh: This is really dangerous for you.  The space could be more adequately reduced with (A) or (B).  (A) is nice because it attacks the two black stones on the left, but it might induce black to build a bigger moyo.]

(;B[ir]LB[ho:C][io:B][ip:A]C[Josh:  This isn't a very good move for black.  It's purpose is seemingly to protect the territory on the bottom side, but black is so strong that the variations at A, B, and C would have been much bigger dangers.]
