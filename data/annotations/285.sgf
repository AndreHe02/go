[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[hq];B[hp];W[ip];B[iq]C[reid: hmm, don't think I've ever seen this tried before  :-)
usually it's a good idea to follow joseki unless there is
an over-riding strategic reason to vary.  in this case, it's
normal to pull back at g4.  if white protects the cut with
k3, black can make another approach to the corner at c6 and
then you'll get into some good fighting :-)

but here I think it would be simpler to follow variation 1.]
(;W[gp]C[ouch!   this is why black usually pulls back.];B[ho];W[gq];B[jq]
C[hmmm, the cutting  stone could be
a problem.  perhaps it's better to
capture it now with k4 instead of
k3.  difficult choice.];W[fp];B[jo]C[painful to have to make another move  here.]

(;B[lc]C[this feels a bit cramped.  I think
I'd play variation 2 instead.];W[gc];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf]
;B[db]L[bf]C[I think black should push once more at a
(b14) first.  when white blocks and
black hanes at d18, black will be alive
in sente instead of gote!  it's true that
white b13 hurts d10 a bit more, but since
d10 is high, it's more of a "running"
stone than a "hunker down and get two
eyes" stone.];W[eb];B[cb];W[bf];B[ec]C[while it's true that the  ladder works
for black, that doesn't mean you should
play it right now :-)  it would be better
to leave this aji for later.  after all,
black can't really hope to gain much
no matter what happens.];W[ed];B[fc];W[fb]C[if white wants sente and  thickness, he
could simply atari the other side (f16)
instead.  he gets sente now and a chance
to pick up b15 in the endgame.  probably
a good idea.  he could follow up with
big sente moves like s16, c5, or r3.];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[ef];B[ge];W[he]
;B[hf];W[ie]C[hmmm, perhaps white could consider
killing the corner with b16 instead.];B[bd]C[urgh!  small life in gote, and  there's
still trouble on the outside.];W[gf];B[ff];W[fg];B[gg];W[ee];B[gf];W[gh]
;B[fh];W[eg];B[hh];W[gi];B[hi];W[if];B[hg];W[gj]L[fi]C[capturing with a (f11) would  leave
white with no worries and black with two
weak groups.];B[ei];W[ch]
(;B[co]C[this is a *major* strategic  mistake!  there's
a huge life and death struggle going on in
the center.  you simply don't have time to
play away from the center fight.  see variation 3.];W[hj]C[white seizes his  chance!]
;B[ji];W[ii];B[ih];W[ij];B[jg]L[kh]C[when deciding where to place the  hanging
connection, you need to consider where you would
rather see your opponent play the forcing move.
in this case, the j14 stones are already alive,
so if you connect with a (l12) and he peeps at
k13, he's not gaining much.  in contrast, a peep
at a will help white's weak r14, r10 stones quite
a bit!  so connecting at a (l12) is better.];W[kh];B[jh];W[ej];B[di];W[bj]
C[don't understand this.  white is already
alive.  better to keep fighting in the
center.];B[ek]C[good!  necessary!];W[jj];B[ki];W[kj];B[lj]C[gutsy!  but it looks  good :-)]
;W[lh];B[lk]C[here, if black just connects, white will have trouble
keeping everything alive.  in general, you want to keep
your non-alive groups down to one or less.  when white
cuts here, it's black who has to start the juggling act.];W[li]C[ouch!]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[kg];W[ke];B[lg]L[mg]C[empty triangle!  avoid this shape like
the plague!  only use it if *nothing*
else works.  here, a (n13) is better.];W[nh];B[mg];W[ni]C[all of a sudden,  those weak r14/r10 stones
are looking disgustingly healthy :-)  they have
no right to be alive so easily.];B[le]L[ng][pg][kl]C[connect in gote is  painful.  since the damage
is already done, perhaps it'd be better to push
once more at a (o13) to guarantee your connection
in sente instead (white would hate to see you get
b (q13) after a).  then you could switch to something
like c (l8) to catch the center.];W[in];B[il]C[this move combines several  mistakes :-(  not only
are you playing too close to thickness, but you
are ignoring the proverb: "even a fool connects
against the peep".  j6 is white's right, and you
should connect at j5 (much as it hurts).];W[jl];B[kl];W[jm];B[jk]C[this  kind of move should only be played
when you have read out *all* the continuations.
otherwise, you are helping your opponent.

a full scale surrounding move like l6 has a
slight chance of succeeding.  but even if
white lives, at least l6 gives you some
compensation.  it's uncomfortable to be in
a position where you have only one plan which
*must* work.  much better to be able to take
several alternate routes to your goal of winning.];W[kk];B[lm];W[km]C[this is  aji-keshi.  white should leave
this for later since he might prefer to
peep at n8 instead.];B[ll];W[ik];B[hl];W[io]C[ouch!];B[hn]L[lp]C[it's  important to make decisions on a *strategic*
rather than on a tactical (or worse, emotional) basis.
after white connects at j5, cutting black apart, he
seems to have miai for life.  given that white is
alive, which stones would black rather hang onto?
the h5 stones? or the k3 group?

black should probably do somthing like a (m4) instead.];W[jp];B[ko]L[kq]
[lq]C[same as before, k3 is more important, so
pulling back with a (l3) or b (m3) is better.];W[kp];B[lo];W[kq]L[pi]

  Malick 8k*: OK, I resign.
  Malick 8k*: I was in trouble right off the bat.
  daj 5k*: but you had recovered somewhat
  Malick 8k*: well, I lived, but I'm in trouble all over the board.
  daj 5k*: yes i have many stones to harrass now
  Malick 8k*: anyway, thanks for the game.
  Malick 8k*: let's play again sometime.
  daj 5k*: thank you

hmmm, I'd still want to see how he responds to something
like a (q11) before I resign.  of course, you'd need to
exchange the b-e sequence first.])
(;B[hj]N[variation 3]C[OK, what's going  on here?  white's j14 and c12 groups
are completely alive.  not even much aji.  black f12,
e11, and d7 are starting to look a bit unhealthy, but
the white g10 stones are pretty weak, so black isn't
too worried on the left side yet.  what black is *really*
concerned with is his center h11 group.  no eyes and
nothing to help out except the weakness of the g10 stones.

well, if that's all he's got to work with, that's what
he should use:

four in a row is *much* stronger than three
in a row (which is why the proverb says "hane
at the head of three stones").  this extends black's
liberties while taking one of whites.  it pushes
the white group in the direction of the strong h5
group.  and it indirectly helps out d7 by keeping  white weak here.]
;W[gk]L[gl]C[if white jumps to a (g8) instead, black  can make
things difficult by pushing in at g9.];B[gm];W[hk];B[jj]C[looks like white  has more to worry about
in this fight than black does.]))
(;B[qh]L[of][pi][rh]C[this is the point to remember with
the three space extension.  if white
jumps to a (p14) black q11 starts a
fight that black should enjoy.  so
probably white will connect with c
(s12) instead.  that should allow
black to build some nice thickness that
(in conjuction with the strong k5 area)
should give him good prospects.]N[variation 2]))
(;AE[iq][hp][ip]N[variation 1]C[white usually  pincers like this when he wants black
to jump into the corner 3-3];B[cq]L[cp][dq]C[white now  decides which side to play:
block outside with a (c4)? or cut at
b (d3)?]
(;W[cp]N[block outside];B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[go]L[cj]C[I'm  sure you already know this joseki, but
the important question is: "is this OK for white?".
black has secure territory, and sente, so white
needs to be able to point to something that he
has gained.  but if black now uses his sente to
play around a (c10):];B[cj]C[then white isn't going to be able to do much
with his thickness.  white's fueski is
difficult after this.  the moral is: don't
use this joseki (as white) unless you already
have an extension around c10.])
(;W[dq]C[if blocking outside is bad, white must
cut here instead.  the joseki continues:];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
;W[eq];B[cn]C[black has nothing to fear from this
position.  again he has solid profit.
on the other hand, white gets sente, so
this is a more reasonable joseki in this
game.

still, if I were white, I think I'd simply
extend to d6 or c6 in response to black's
kakari at f3.])))
