C[Hello,
 In this game, there are two important things : 
1) you miss many chances to win the game rapidily
2) you and your opponent play too many bad kikashi (= forcing move). This can 
seem not important, but when you will loose a game due to a bad semea√Ø where yo
u were 1 liberty behind, caused by a bad kikashi, you will understand what i'm
 saying.
 Nevertheless, it was a very inetresting game.

Thomas

 it was good or how best to react to it...

(;W[ld]LB[jc:A][kc:B]C[dennis: This move troubles me. I didn't see a way to connect undern
eath, and killing it wasn't really feasable either.
 Does this mean that I should have played A at B instead?
 Are there rules of thumb for this kind of reductions/invasions at the side?

Yes B was better than A
moreover, white's move is not good]

whatver the moment when this move was played, it is a typicaly bad kikashi : white A group lost 1 liberty]

i agree,


now you can see that black's corner is in trouble. This comes from the fact that black should have played C instead of B]
