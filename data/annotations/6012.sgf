AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hi, this is a game between me and and a 8-dan player on IGS.  I'll admit I was so intimidated right from the start I never even expected to win.  I kept on trying to find the best move and waited to jump on an opportunity to attack that didn't come until the late midgame, I definitely feel I didn't play my best at all.  The result was this 17 pt loss even though white definitely let me off the hook more than once, this probably should've been a 50 pt loss.  Any help, especially with nine-stone handicap games like this would be much appreciated.

Thanks!
Charlie Pan];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd]C[I chose this joseki because my Q10 stone prevents an ideal extension.]
;W[pm];B[np]C[Too passive?  I know the O10 cap is pretty common in handicap games, although I'll admit this is the first time I've actually played against it.

PP:  This is fine, but if you are afraid or really want to win then Q12 is also available now.]
;W[nj]C[Here's the cap.  I know trying to live on the inside is bad, so I wanted to attack his Q14 group.]
;B[ph]C[PP:  good];W[oi];B[og]C[Big mistake...I should've just connected.  The chance to cut is still there.

PP: doesn't look like a mistake to me - this is a different, and safer for black, way to play.]
;W[pi];B[qi]C[PP: but to keep it simple, maybe R12 instead of R11.]
;W[qh];B[of];W[qj];B[pk];W[ri];B[ol];W[om];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml]
;W[pl];B[mm]C[Too slow?  I almost wanted to cry at this position, I was thinking "attack attack" right from the first move and now white's group is alive and bursting into the center...

PP: connecting your two stones is possible, but this is also fine.]
;W[fq];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[dn]C[PP: C5 looks better for b to harrass white, but no real problems yet.]
;W[cr];B[co]C[Solid connection probably better.

PP: or B3 for black.];W[cf];B[hq]C[PP:  too slow, responding in upper left bigger.]
;W[gq];B[hr];W[bq];B[bp]C[PP:  why fight ko? responding in upper left is bigger - white is hoping for both and you give him chance.]
;W[lq];B[kq]C[PP:  I like enclose white with M3 better, works well with N7 stones and later makes saving Q9 stones sente.]
;W[oq];B[op]C[Suddenly, my lower right group becomes heavy...]
;W[kr];B[br]C[I was in my crazy attack mode here, but I definitely don't have enough ko threats for this.

PP: M4 still looks good, as does any standard move in upper left.]
;W[aq];B[ap];W[cp];B[rg]C[PP:  You thought this was a ko threat?  Hot spots still are upper left and lower side.]
;W[cq];B[qg];W[kp];B[jo]C[Another mistake.  I should've just connected and attacked white on the bottom.]
;W[jq];B[hp]C[PP:  inviting white to play G5 is not worth saving the two stones.]
;W[pr];B[qn];W[rm];B[qm];W[ql];B[qq];W[fc];B[ee];W[cc];B[dc]
C[PP:  I see no reason to choose either side, so tenuki time!]
;W[db];B[eb];W[bb];B[ec]C[PP:  D19 first seems better.];W[rn]
;B[be]C[Another wishful "attack".];W[ce];B[cd];W[bd];B[ad];W[bc]

C[My bottom right shape here is horrible, but I didn't see any alternatives.]
;B[oh]C[Too small?

PP: yes - I think so.  Also upper left fight looks like you don't count liberties in cutting fights.  It is very important.]
;W[ro];B[nq];W[nr];B[rp]C[I'm pretty sure the bottom right group is already dead, but I think white felt sorry for me and let it live.]
;W[go];B[hn]C[PP:  Bamboo joint is better if you want to save these 5 stones.]
;W[ho];B[km];W[gn];B[ch];W[fb];B[ea];W[hc];B[jc]C[PP:  maybe J18 (foot sweep) is better for black?]
;W[ge];B[jf];W[ie];B[if];W[hf];B[ib]C[PP:  at this point J18 is endgame move and left side and center still look active.]
;W[eg];B[dg];W[hh];B[hj];W[ef];B[de];W[ig];B[gg];W[gh];B[fg]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[ff];B[je];W[rf];B[rh]C[PP:  why not connect at Q13?]
;W[qi];B[pg];W[fj];B[gl];W[dl];B[ek]C[I thought my bottom left stones were too full of weaknesses to try saving.  My mentality at this point was basically kill kill kill, but looking at it now that white group is pretty much alive.

PP:  I can't even guess which of the three white groups on that side you think you are attacking.  A calm mind while playing is very difficult for many people, but very important.]

C[PP:  If white plays J4 then the entire lower left corner is white, so if this was not a simul game for white then yes he was nice to you for the rest of the game.]

;W[hb];B[fa];W[id];B[fe];W[gf];B[gd];W[fd];B[ic];W[hd];B[jh]
;W[po];B[ok]C[PP: Still too small to rescue two stones.];W[pn]

C[PP:  Even I can see that white has purposely made small moves to see your choices.  He didn't have time for review or you did not ask?  Advice from BandWson is gold - get it when you can.]
;B[pq];W[or];B[ps];W[mr];B[bi];W[ai];B[nh]C[I didn't see D19.]
;W[lj];B[kl];W[sb];B[oa];W[gj];B[ko]C[PP:  G10 is another example - with Q19 the upper right white group lives - he is giving you a chance to play Q19 when he plays G10.]

[hm][im][rq][sr][rs][ss]C[PP:  The theme seems to be your overlooking things like liberty counts and opportunities to kill.  It sounds like your game would improve if you thought of each move as a whole board problem instead of thinking of attacking or being attacked.]
