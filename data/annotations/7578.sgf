C[Hello, my name is Jim and I am 7k on KGS.  I live in Japan and I play go at a go club here every week, with people who trash me on a fairly consistent basis (old men who are always there and played there whole lives) heh.  Anyway, you did some good things in the game but overall you need to not be so paranoid, and be careful about some common traps (black didn't notice either but as you get closer to 10k it will be a piece of cake for your opponent to take advantage of these situations).  Try to think of the meaning behind your moves, and play closer to the boundary between white and black (you will see what I mean later).  Finally, sente is like gold in end game.  Try to keep it for as long as possible.  Keep playing!]

R16, then P 17 then Q or R 10

You are right to play this move, in fact black should try to stop you.  This way, you are extending from your secure corner in a way that can make a two story house around A :D!!]

;B[ck];W[cl];B[dl];W[bl];B[bk];W[en];B[dm];W[qq]C[have i invaded too soon at 3,3 ?

The question is not about too soon or too late, it's about benefit.  What are you looking to gain here?  The corner territory?  I noticed that lower ranking players are all very concerned about getting the corner, but I often welcome a 3x3 invasion as a chance to build valuable influence.  In this case I guess it's fine, black's influence won't get too much since white is sticking out on the left.]

my opponent is saying that the move at f8 won the game for  me
is he correct?

Well, you can figure out that answer yourself.  If that group lives, you lose 14 points if all the stones are equal, since you won by more than 14 points the answer is no, you didn't win because of that move.  You probably won because of capturing D2.]
