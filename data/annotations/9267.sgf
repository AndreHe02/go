;B[dk];W[jd];B[kj];W[dd]C[Is this a good way to start ? I wanted a soft beginning letting him the bottom, taking the top.

Paps: Its Ok each player has one side!];B[hk]
(;W[kh]C[Maybe too far... Had to stengthen my territory

Paps: Approching from this side is not good in this situation because L4 stone is low and you have no follow up move.
It's better to approach the other side];B[kc]LB[jc:A][kd:B]
C[1st time he's knocking like this. Severe hit ?
Paps it all right but you cannot capture this stone you have to block the outside and build an outside wall 
2 choices A or B (sorry not your move!) as you have a stone at D10 , A is better (you can make your stones work efficiently together)]

(;W[lc]C[Thinking to surround him. But with two ?]
(;B[ld];W[kd]C[A better one ? How to save M11 and attack L11 ?

Paps: good move as your opponent forgot to push through your keima oyu have to cut!
NB/ You cann't save M11 better not to play there!!];B[lb]
(;W[jb]C[Didn't know how to settle here...];B[le]C[Paps: when your opponent invades the sansan (3-3 point: C11; L11;L3; C3) after you played hoshi (4-4 point: D10;K10;K4;D4) oyu have to remember that it's not  possible to capture him your goal is to build an outside wall. 

to exchange the corner for an outside wall is OK. If your opponent comes out it's bad for you!]

(;W[lf]TR[kd]C[Stopping him growing and joining L6.

Paps: once more you are allowing  black to cut a keima (marked stones)]
;B[ke]C[But troubles start];W[jf]C[Trying to connect the 2 parts M8,K10]
;B[je];W[ie];B[jc];W[id]C[Paps: If you play to close to your opponent stones you give him to much cutting points and are anable to stop him]
;B[ic];W[hc]C[I think these hits are not good there...];B[ib]
;W[me]C[Attacking to four stones, nevertheless it was suicide. Was it better to join the left part ?]
;B[hb];W[mc]C[Thinking I could save him.];B[mb];W[kf];B[md]
C[Definitely not...];W[mf];B[cc]C[2nd hit.

Paps now your L6 stone is too close to your wall this is the wrong direction!
and black comes out at H12. 
this play in the upper right corner is not good for you!

playing at N8 is very very small ( 2 points perhaps) and is not protecting the cut at J8 
there are many bigger place to play D11, C8, C5 or connectoin at J8]
;W[jj]C[Maybe I could take some territory + gain control on the center.

Paps: this corner stone is strong impossible to gain much by playing a contact move.]
;B[jk]
(;W[hj];B[ij];W[ji];B[ii]LB[hj:A][jj:B]C[Paps: Ouch!!!!
allowing A and B stones being separated is very bad (A stone is a wasted stone) for this reason you should have avoided playing A!)]
;W[ih];B[hi]C[I start to feel quite tightly. I had to look for left part of the goban in stead of attacking.]
;W[gj]C[or desperatly saving what is lost...];B[gk];W[gi]LB[ih:B]
[gi:A]C[Paps: AB stones= keima!!
 never let you opponent separate your stones like this! it's better to sacrifice one stone than trying to save every single stone]
;B[hh]C[I thought sending him up would be good, but looking at it now, he's cutting me in half...]
;W[gh];B[ig];W[jh];B[gg];W[ej]TR[gg][ig][hh][hi][ii][ij][hk]
[jk]C[Again thinking to save the 4 stones on G column.

Paps: This shape is very good for black!!!white is completely separated and after the cut at J8 possibly dies everywhere!

Yes I see you're trying to save these stones but it was better to sacrifice H4 at the beenning of the sequence! now you have troubleon both sides!]
;B[ci]C[Now coming for the left part would be quite difficult.]

(;W[ei];B[if];W[gf]C[Pretending to play a kind of central position helping each corner. But it's actually helping neither...]
;B[fg];W[df]C[Again a connexion that is not. Is F8 better ?]
;B[ff];W[he]C[Connecting (but to what ?)];B[fd]C[Really awful...]
;W[ee];B[fe];W[dc]C[I didn't know what else to play in order to save something...]
;B[cd];W[fc]C[Would the connexion be possible ?

Paps : no];B[gc]C[No...];W[hd]C[Many will die...];B[ce];W[ed]
;B[fb];W[ec]C[Left corner will doubtfully survive I thought.]
;B[bg];W[dh];B[ek];W[ch]C[Trying to gain some space.];B[bi]
;W[bh]C[To separate them.];B[cg];W[dg]C[And finally wanting to do to many things I achieved none.]
;B[ah];W[cf];B[bf];W[fh];B[eg]C[Difficult to live there...]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[eh]C[Had to play F4 immidiately.];B[fj];W[da]
;B[cb];W[ea]C[An unnecessary connexion];B[eb];W[db];B[ca]C[I resigned. I think while I was covering some mistakes, other weaknesses were being built. What was the key mistake ? How to avoid it ?
Could you gess how strong was my opponent ?


Paps:
Probably was your opponent rather strong because he used well the opportunities you gave him to separate your groups and at the end all your groups are dead.

biggest problem: first try to keep your stones connected oyu must avoid your opponent pushing throught keima and tobi this is very important in order to build strong positions 

2: practise a lot of tsumegos in order to recognise how you can make two eyes for your groups

3 identify big moves and small moves: Studiing professionnal games can help you to achieve this goal: first just learn the 100 first moves an when you are 10K try to understand why they are playing like this!!

4 you can study the classical moves in the corner (what happened when black played L11 or C11
have a look for exemple on: http://eidogo.com/

and of course play a lot!!  Don't be discouraged if you lose your first 100 games it's completely normal!

If you have any question contact me per mail or on KGS.
