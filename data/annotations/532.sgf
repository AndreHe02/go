For this reason, I think it is more important to play something

consider playing kikashi at 'B' (m4) before (see variation).]

This would strengthen the p10 group, reduce the white potential
on the lower side, and worry the white group p13.
Once again your move is essentially territorial (the life of the
black lower left corner group is not really threatened, besides you
also have O4).

>From this game I get the impression that both players  have a solid tactical ability, but that their way of thinking
is too much concerned with forming or destroying territory.
In the first half of a game, strong players think mainly in terms
of using their stones as efficiently as possible and try very hard
to play moves that influence the whole board. If you play efficient
moves, territory will always form itself naturally sooner or later.
To improve your game, I suggest you try and shift your way of thinking
accordingly.]BL[19];W[ll]C[

Yes. It would probably have been better to play it immediately
after taking the ko, because now you may have a hard time
saving your bamboo joint when white plays 'a' (g10), and if you
lose it that will probably be too much.
