C[cut: [To Reviewer\] Thanks in advance for your time.
This was a close game and could have gone either way. I felt
white could have played a bit more agreesive to win the game.
Please comment on both black and white. Please note where white
could have punished bad moves by black but did not. Please provide
variations when appropriate. Thanks again.];C[Igc2000 Generated Sgf File]
;B[pd];W[do];C[**cut**: hi];B[pq];W[de]C[Very unusual];B[qo]
;W[jp];B[jd];W[hc]LB[cc:C][fd:B][he:A]C[I don't like this shape. Too easy for B to press and then live in corner with bA, wB, bC]

(;B[dj]C[This looks strange to me.  If I were going to play in this side I woujld play on the third line to give the stone more stability.  However, with two W corners open I would be inclined to try to for a large moyo myself.]
;W[ch];B[cm]C[This narrow extensive is why II orefer the previous move to be low]
;W[bn]LB[gj:B][bo:A]C['A' seems saver given the weakness in the corner.  If black now jumps to B, white has achieved little and is still open to a corner invasion.  Playing at A does not prvent the corner invasion but it does give a bit more support if black invades.]
;B[dq]LB[gj:A]C[Too early,  Black cannot expect to invade with sente and so his two outside stones can expect ot be attacked and W will move toward black's moyo on the right while attacking.  This is not what B wants.  Jumping to A looks safer.  B can alos consider letting the two stones look after themselves and expand his moyo, although this could be a big risky.  DEpends on how good B is at making shape.]
;W[en]LB[fp:A]C[A looks better to press B at the bottom and build strength for a large scale attack.]
;B[gq]C[Too easy for B here]
(;W[mq]LB[oq:A]C[White should probably consider going all the way to A]
;B[cn];W[co];B[bm];W[bp];B[dc]LB[cr:A]TR[br][jr]C[What about wA?  B should really take care of the two stones are the bottom.  Either of the triangled points is worth considering, but B must not run out as this will seriously affect the side group]
;W[bj]LB[cc:A]C[No rush to play here. Settle the top first with A]
;B[el]LB[ee:A]TR[dc]SQ[dq][gq]C[B has to be very careful - he has three weak groups as shown and he can expect to have one or two of them get into trouble.  I would consider this groujp to be the most expendable.  As W has not settled to top how about trying 'A' to isolate a single W stone and try to redress the balance of weak groups.]
;W[cr]C[Good timing. B is in trouble];B[dr];W[cq];B[ce]LB[jr:A]
C[I think B needs to play A];W[cf];B[cd];W[bf]C[Too dangerous.  A solid connection is best.]
;B[fc]LB[ee:A]C['A' looks better.];W[hr];B[gr]LB[hq:A]C['A' first]
;W[hq];B[go];W[fp]C[Wrong direction.  W needs to keep the two B groups separated.  This move is not urgent.]
;B[gp];W[gm];B[fo];W[ep];B[in]LB[dn:B][eo:A]C[I recommend playing 'A' first to see how W responds.  If W connects B (as expected) B can capture two stones later and does not need to run away immediately.]
;W[gk]LB[df:A][fj:B][fn:C]C[cut: Is this the best attack by white?
SGF: Seems very weak to me.  With the cut at 'A' W cannot attack very strongly and so this move, which can be cut from behind seems like an overplay.  B can just play B and wait for a change to cut at A or C]
;B[fj];W[il];B[hp]C[Too heavy.];W[ip];B[io]TR[hp][ip]C[What did B gain by the triangled exchange?  He should have just played here immediately.]

(;W[jr]LB[lp:A]C[cut: Is this necessary? Should white have played L6 instead?
SGF: Not needed, but L6 is also dangerous because B can push.  Setting back to A and securting the group is better.]
;B[kn];W[em];B[dl];W[fl]C[Funny shape.];B[eh];W[ef];B[dg]C[Why?  B gains nothing is W connects.]
;W[df];B[gg];W[he]C[Dangerous.  If W loses his connection to the lieft the group will probably die unless it is protected -- which takes gote.]
;B[gd];W[hd];B[ge]C[Now W is cut of and needs to live in gote.  He does not have time for the three stones at the top.]
;W[hf];B[gf]C[cut: I felt that I connected too easily!];W[jf]

(;B[md]C[cut: can black kill C12 group now?
SGF: A better question is whether W can live.  As shown in the variation to this move, B can easily kill Whiteor reduce the corner to one eye if he plays first.  The question is what happens if W plays first.]

(;W[ih]C[Can W live in the left?  See variation.];B[hi]C[Not needed unless B is aiming to attack the side group, in which a direct attack if better.]

;W[kc];B[kb];W[jc];B[qe]C[cut: Close game, so far. I wanted to secure corner. Should I
have played Q10 instead?
SGF: B seems to have a clear lead so this is probably OK, but Q10 cannot be considered bad.]
;W[qj]C[Perfect point.];B[ql];W[qg];B[ij]LB[jl:A]C[Does not affect W at all.  Far too slow.  Only threat here is a distant one of playing one the left to reduce W to one eye in the corner and then playing at 'A' but that it remote that this stage and needed more preparation.]
;W[jj];B[jk];W[ik];B[kj];W[ji];B[kk];W[jl];B[mk]C[This ddn't help B much.  A dfirect attack on the right would be more productive]

SGF.  If not W can play at A.];B[lp]LB[nq:A]C[W is not going to die so attacking at A makes more sense.]

;C[The most significant point about this game was the way W failed to take advantage of Black's weak groups.  In the end Black won because because of this.   Both players should concetrate more on the relative strength of groups and learn when to secure groups and when to attack.  Many oppportunities where missed by both sides.]
