AB[pd][dp]C[Hi Francis,

  My name is Zoran Rilak, a.k.a. wayward at KGS; I'm a student from Belgrade, Serbia.  My rank at KGS is 7k (been that for a long while ;) ), and I hope my review will be informative and easy to unberstand.  If I fail at that, or if you have any additional questions/comments/corrections, please feel free to contact me via e-mail.

  To separate my comments from the rest of the game chatter and your questions, they will be enclosed in square brackets: [...\].

Disclaimer: everything I say is solely a reflection of my understanding of the game.  Since I'm not a *Go master* or anything near it, please take all of my advices as suggestions for personal analysis; if something I say sinks in, that's great, but if something feels strange or just wrong, follow your instinct and develop your own vision of the game. 

And most important, have fun!

Zoran

Me: black 19k (kgs) white 17k
First balanced game on kgs. Others often lots of weird fighting, where I trash beginners and get trashed by stronger players.

Few games under my belt (~15), relatively a lot of book-reading.

I appreciate any advice!

Thank you,

(;B[dn]C[[ This is playable, but considering the rest of your game, I feel a hint is in place here.  When you play with handicap stones, you basically want them to help you fight, *not* make territory.  Even more experienced opponents might face trouble when they play against weaker players who can utilize their star-stones to create influence early on in the game.

In this case, I'd recommend going for the attachment from the top, to create a strong wall facing your marked stone.  Check variation. \]]
;W[jq]C[[ This seems too stretched.  White should take care not to play too loose when facing a strong Black wall, or Black could attack and gain thickness purely by attacking a group which should have otherwise been stable (see variation). \]]

(;B[jd]C[[ Good move, both considering the top and the left side.  Also resonates well with the aji of extending your moyo (potential territory) by attacking White's two stones at the bottom. \]]
;W[ci]C[[ Of course, this could only be expected... \]];B[ck]
C[[ Correct direction.  Make territory and force White towards your area of influence. \]]
;W[df]C[[ Here's a mistake by White.  Better would be to play on 2nd line, grab some territory and threaten to slide further into the corner.  Now Black has a chance to strenghten while making White defend. \]]

(;B[fd]C[[ Another territory-making move; basically not wrong, but check out the variation for a more aggressive strategy. \]]
;W[ff]
(;B[cc]C[[ There's no need to play submissively here. C15 is the correct move to secure corner and keep sente. \]]
;W[pj]C[[ now White takes the last big fuseki point.  This is the cost of giving away sente with C17 :(  \]]
;B[qg];W[qm]TR[df][ff][ci][fq][jq]C[[ White is obviously going for a big moyo in the corner.  S11 is a big point for both sides now, but it's best left for some later time; Black has the chance to regain initiative by attacking the two weak White groups (marked).  It's hard to tell where Black should start now, since attacking the bottom marked group from either side seems to strenghten White, and an attack on the top group still seems implausible because White could flee and counterattack on the top.  I think a play at tengen (A) or a light approach at B would give Black good chances to stay on the top. \]]

;W[hp]C[I don't know how to respond now. Was H4 better?

[ Well, to be honest, I'm never certain about these attachment myself -- check out my variation for what I feel is playable.  When in doubt, I usually go for simple solutions, as you'll see. \]]

[al:S][km:S][np:S][nr:S]C[I wanted to connect all the stones in the center, but then White took this large area on the left..

[ This happened because you were too concerned about the safety of your center group.  Recall my comment from the move 104. When under attack, play lightly (spread your stones) and stop the attack as soon as possible. \]

[ The game is near yose now, and since it's your move you should consider how much territory you have.  A very rough estimate gives bith Black and White some 50-60 points each, so your next few moves might actually decide the winner.  The golden rule of yose says to play moves following their priority:
1) moves that are sente for both players,
2) moves that are sente for you but gote for your opponent,
3) moves that are sente for your opponent but gote for you.

A quick glance at the board will quickly reveal some urgent points for Black.  I've marked some of these moves with letter 'S'.  You can play either one of them and be sure that White will not tenuki (play elsewhere = not answer) without losing more points than he will gain that way. \]]

[ It's a shame you lost this game, since you had so many chances to take over the initiative and make a huge difference in the early game.  It seems to me that your biggest miss was that when you started to extract your two stones from the bottom.  It seemed as if the global picture was kinda lost on you for a while, which allowed White to save his two weak groups and balance the situation.  The very fact that White wins by such a small margin says two things: a) you were way ahead before White started pushing you around in the center, and b) even after White managed to save his two groups you were still so close that actually one yose move could have made all the difference. 
  My advice to you generally goes in three directions, and I'll sum it up here: 
- Use your stones to build thickness and attack, rather than secure territory too early on.
- Always be the one who looks over the entire board, even when you're forced to defend (especially then).  Sometimes attack is the best defense!
- One player gets to enter yose first, you be the one!  Evaluate moves, be the first to make highest-value sente plays, and stay ready to tenuki without fear if you think your opponent takes a small point which you think could be balanced elsewhere. 

  That's it. I hope you could follow and it wasn't too boring for you. Like I said, for any additional communication use my e-mail - I'll be glad to answer.  And have fun! :) 

See you at KGS,
