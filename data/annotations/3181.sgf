AB[pd][dp]C[
Hello,

I lost this game by a little amount, for several reasons, in order of importance :

1) my opponent had a smart yose
2) I made a couple of small blunders that cost me some small stones

3) accounting for at least 30 points : my weakness in Chuban, for keeping my territory.

You will see after move 100 what happens to the right side.

Ok, I chose the wrong line of play.

If you review this game, please put all your knowledge here :

Of course, I have made out myself better lines of play, than the one I chose in the game.

What I don't understand, and which is the cause of my ever losing games when I should win them, is the deep rationale between stones, shapes, ...

I'm not sure it is simply "reading" that I need. It's what stones accomplish, that I'm blind about.

I hope I have made myself clear, and you can help.];W[dd];B[pq]
