;B[dq]C[Robert: I did win this game fairly easily. Therefore Im not looking for the whole game to get commented. What I want to know relates to  only on piece of the game. Specifically, I fought the joseki in the upper left badly. I would like ideas on how to improve this. These mistakes  end up costing me dearly.
I am only really interested on comenting on the joseki and resulting left side battle.]

[ec:d]C[after white plays f17, several possibilities are opened for black :

 a : attack f17 stone without touching it
  b : defend the top
 c : attach to the stone on top
 d : attach on the side]
(;B[fd]TR[fc]C[f16 is not a bad idea tostrengthen the upper left area, but the drawback is that at the same time it strenghten the lonely marked stone.

In this board position i would advice to simply play d14, it strengthen the top for black and doesn't touch the marked stone, leaving the choice to white how to deal with this stone.]

(;W[cc]LB[gd:a]C[c17 is too early, white should play (a) to developp the top.

wrong side to block, black should _allways_ play c16 in this position, allowing him to build a large moyo (potential territory) on the left side.]

(;B[dc];W[cd]C[now black is cramped, it will not be easy for him to developp something as if he had played c16]
;B[ce];W[be];B[df]C[d14 should be c14 it gives white a free atari at c14]
;W[cf];B[de];W[cg];B[cb]C[c18 is not necessary right now, i think keeping pushing  at d13 is better to build a wall, preparing for a larger extension on the top side at o17 for example.]
;W[bb];B[ch]TR[dj]C[c12 is not really good, white can d13 now and come out in the open wich would cause dannage to black possible top, keeping him separate from the marked stone]
;W[bh];B[ci];W[ag];B[db];W[ac];B[jd]LB[nc:a][lc:b][ld:c][kd:d]
[kc:e][jc:f]C[k16 good, maybe a bit timid, attacking the corner at (a) would be better. Because black have nothing to fear about his group at d17, he can extend as far as (a) without being afarid of white puincering at (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f)]
;W[lc];B[gd]C[g16 way too shy, l17is the moveto stop white from sliding under him at k18 for example]
;W[kf];B[mq]C[n3 is good, approach q3 stone and developp the bottom at the same time]
