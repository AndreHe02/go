GC[Commentary by Reid Augustin Feb 24, 2001]

C[TJH: I am black in this game. I made the record after the game so there may be mistakes, but I am almost certain it is correct.

I have put quite a lot of questions in the comments, so you don't have to bother answering them all. In fact I would be even more interested in the things I missed completely and never even noticed.

Thank you for reviewing my game.

Tim.];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dd];B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[pk]
C[TJH: I felt that playing the two moves in the bottom left corner before making the Chinese formation was interesting. I think that it works quite well. What is your opinion?

reid: Indeed, an interesting idea.  The variation looks rather good for black.]

(;W[jd];B[fp];W[po]C[reid: This looks like a fairly classic "bad continuation" for white.  It's hard for white to
get a good base here - he'll be cramped at best, floating at worst.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[pm]LB[ql:A]C[TJH: Black now has a choice of where to play.

Continuing the attack on the right side does not seem to be terribly urgent.

I decided to press white down on the left where he had ignored my move.   I must admit that I didn't really consider anything else.

reid:  Hmmm, I beg to differ.  It looks to me like there is very little investment anywhere on the board
except for the lower right corner.  Black at a (R8) is crying to be played!]

(;B[co]C[reid:  There is no doubt that this move is very big.  Lots of territory lost for white.
  Forcing him down to the second line.  All that good stuff.

However, the life and death on the right is urgent.  And black C5 is likely to lose sente.
When life and death hangs in the balance, sente is everything!  See the variation.]
;W[bo];B[dp];W[bq];B[cn];W[bn];B[cl];W[lq]C[TJH: I was very supprised by this invasion. White already has a weak group on the right, so this invasion seems to give me a chance to engineer a splitting attack.

reid: I agree - this seems dangerous for white.];B[mq]LB[jq:A]
C[reid: Hmmm, a classic splitting attack is one weak group in between two weak groups.  By
responding on this side black is trying to get one strong group between two weak groups - not
quite the formula.  Perhaps black should consider a (K3) instead?]
;W[iq];B[lp]LB[ql:B][jp:A]C[TJH: Is this really the best move? I played it almost instinctively ...

reid: It's certainly natural, but white seems to get a good result.  There are several
other options, including a (K4) first, or switching to b (R8) to see what happens on
this side.];W[kq]C[TJH: But when white answers];B[ql];W[qm]
;B[rl]LB[nl:A]C[TJH: I don't know why I played here. I was very suprised when I was replaying the game and I realised that I had played this move on the second line. There must be a better move in the centre.

reid: Perhaps something around a (O8) would work a bit better.

S8 is good to undercut white's eye-shape, but S2 is already doing that, so S8 is redundant.  This slow
move changes the course of the game.];W[nm];B[nk];W[jn];B[ln]
LB[mn:B][mo:A]C[reid: M10 looks natural, but it leaves a weakness at a (N5).  Perhaps b (N6)
works a bit better?];W[ml];B[km];W[im]
(;B[kk]C[TJH: Is black playing the severest moves here? One space to the right might actually kill white. During the game I felt that the fight was going well for me anyway so I was just happy to keep on playing good shape moves to keep it simple.

reid: I think black can be more severe here. It looks like a (M9) and b (M10) are the moves to
consider.  Both seem to lead to good results for black.  See variations.]
;W[mk];B[nj]C[reid: I expected black to hane here :-)

Letting white out so easily is a shame.   Blocking white's exit with a (N10) may not work, but white
has to struggle to get out, while black builds thickness.];W[lj]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[jr]C[TJH: At the time I thought (hoped) that this might be a tesuji.]
;W[ir];B[jq]C[reid: I think this is premature.  White didn't answer your peep (L2) with K3, as you expected.
That is his perogative, of course, but it means he has a weakness.  But black can't make much
profit from this weakness yet.  At worst, white can sacrifice his L/M3 stones if he really needs
to maintian his connection between J3 and J7.

So black should wait and exploit this weakness when the time is right.  This weakness will at
least make white expend more brain-power trying to hold everything together :-)]
;W[kr];B[jo];W[ip];B[lr];W[js];B[io];W[ho];B[ko];W[hn]LB[hr:B]
[mr:A]C[TJH: ... but it did not quite work as well as I had hoped.

Black has a forcing move at G2 (threatening the cut at H4). I was unsure when to play it. Should I play it now? If white gets stronger in the middle it might no longer be forcing.

reid: It's not a very strong threat as long as white's J7 stones are not surrounded.  White has both a (N2) and b (H2) after
black G2, so his K4 group is safe in miai.];B[ji]LB[ci:A]C[TJH: I wanted to continue the attack so that I could strengthen my moyo on the right. Is this the correct plan now?

reid: Hmmm, if you want to strenghten the moyo on the right, then it makes sense to play on
the right, no?  This may be sente now, but black needs to make sure he keeps sente so he can
come back and strengthen his C8 lower-left (C8) group.  A move like this, that may lose sente, can be dangerous at a time like this.  Probably best to simly extend with something like a (C11)

Now the downside of pushing at J/K5 becomes obvious.];W[kj]
;B[jj];W[lh];B[nh];W[jk];B[jl];W[ik];B[jg];W[kh];B[il];W[hk]
;B[hi];W[ng];B[og];W[mg];B[of];W[hl]C[reid: white's timing was very nice in this sequence - black never had a chance to take advantage
of the white weaknesses.];B[if]LB[gm:A][gr:B]C[reid: Ouch!  It hurts to have to make a move like this.

Instead, now migh be a good time to peep at a (G7) and force at b (G2).  If white refuses
to connect, the threat of a cut will help black settle his center (H11) stones.]
;W[md]C[TJH: Now what?

The area I have made on the right is nearly 40 points, but I am quite nervous about it. I think that I need to add 1 more move (R15?) before it is really territory. Then I have 10 points at the bottom right. The other 2 groups don't really amount to much territory, and in fact, now that white is alive everywhere, I may have to worry about them a bit.

White has 15 points in the lower left, perhaps another 10 in the groups I was attacking, and komi. That is about 30, so white wins is he makes 20 points more at the top than I can make on the left side.   I did not analyse it in this much detail during the game. Anyway, I felt that it was a reasonable position for black to be in. I was a bit annoyed that I did not have a clearer lead, since this all started with white's invasion at M3 which I thought was questionable.]
;B[cf]LB[hd:A]C[TJH: This was my attempt to defend my two groups a bit whilst sketching out some territory. It might actually have been better one space to the right at D14. That seems to strengthen my cetral group a bit more.

As I was recording the game afterwards someone passing suggested that I should have peeped first at G7, to help my lower left group a bit.

reid: Yes, G7 would help.

Previously, you identified the top area as the key to white's win.  I think you should
follow this idea by playing at a (H16).  This puts a serious dent in white's potential
while starting to settle your main liability.];W[ch]C[TJH: This was another white move that I found very suprising.

reid: It's surprisingly effective!  It threatens to divide black into three weak
groups.  I think it demonstrates that black C14 was a bit of an over-play.]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[di];W[en];B[em];W[cm];B[dm];W[do];B[fn]C[TJH: I don't know what happened. I managed to read out that if I connected at D6 then white would cut of my 4 stones at the bottom. That is quite a bad hallucination.

reid: Ouch!  Serious blunder.  Oh well, reading mistakes are part of the game...]
;W[dn];B[gm]LB[fo:A]C[reid: white should probably ignore this peep in favor of a (F5).  The 4 black
stones are bigger than the 4 white stones.];W[hm];B[eo]LB[dk:B]
[gp:A]C[reid:  Black loses a tempo here.  Instead, he can play at a (G4) to connect while
threatening the cut.  Keeping sente here makes a huge difference - black can
get to b (D9) first.];W[gi];B[gh];W[gj];B[bm]LB[fh:A][dl:B]
C[reid: Dangerous situation for black.  He really needs a (F12), but
the cut at b (D8) is severe.];W[cn];B[gr];W[hr];B[gq];W[hp]
;B[dk];W[fh];B[gg];W[fl];B[gl]C[reid: Probably better to not make this exchange. White F9 makes
the black group even weaker, while black G8 doesn't help it get
stronger.];W[fk];B[fm];W[eg]C[TJH: I was not expecting this moves.   I can't remember exactly what order the next few moves happened in.]
;B[eh];W[ei];B[dh];W[fg];B[ff];W[dg];B[ej]LB[ci:A]C[reid: A (C11) looks better, but perhaps the move order was different
and it wasn't available?];W[df];B[cg];W[fi];B[ce];W[ci];B[dj]
;W[de]C[TJH: But we deninitely ended up here.];B[id]C[TJH: The semei on the left is quite interesting. I think that I need to play one more move to capture the two white stones, but it can be something like B17. First I have to live in the centre, if possible.]
;W[ic];B[je]C[TJH: might it be better to play something like the corss-cut or double hane instead?

reid:  I thnk the real question is "how did a game that was so good for black turn into
a game where black is struggling at every turn?"

The simple answer is that white managed to seperate black into three groups.  But that
just pushes the question back a bit more.

White played very aggresively in this game, and I think that took black by surprise a few times.
Black played a few slow moves, and a few aji-keshi sequences which allowed white to turn his
liabilities into strengths.  Perhaps black thought he was ahead and played a bit complacently
in a few places.

It seems to me that what turned the game around was that white was always focussed on
the big issues, while black seemed to get a bit distracted.  That's easy to do when you're
ahead.  Sometimes a won game is very hard to bring home.

White saved his weak groups, and in turn, split black apart.  Perhaps black was thinking
too much about his right-side moyo, and not enough about the strength and weakness
on the rest of the board.];W[kd];B[hd];W[ge];B[he];W[gf];B[hf]
;W[bk];B[bj];W[cj];B[ck];W[bi];B[bl];W[cd];B[aj];W[bg];B[ai]
;W[bh];B[gk]C[TJH: The problem is now that even if I live everywhere I am a bit behind on the board, and white gets komi. Can you see any cances for black?]
;W[kf];B[jf]LB[ib:E][hc:B][gd:C][fe:D][ih:A]C[reid: Looks like a (J12) is better for eye-shape, but black should
play b (H17) first anyway.

Black could also consider the C-D-E sequence.];W[hh]C[TJH: Anyway I will be lucky to live.]
