C[i'm playing black here and will mark my comments/questions with "H:"

thanks in advance to the reviewer!

[JB\] I will try to do my best, thanks to you.];B[pd];W[dq]
;B[cd];W[qp];B[ec];W[co];B[jq]LB[cj:a]C[[JB\] A move near "a" would be natural too]
;W[gq];B[mq];W[oq]
(;B[dj]LB[cg:D][cj:A][dj:B][cm:C]C[H: would a lower extension on A (with possible D or C, depending on w's answer) have been better than B?

[JB\] I prefer "A" because White C5 is low (see Var.2)];W[dh]
;B[cm];W[dn];B[dm];W[ci];B[cg]LB[cj:A]C[H: i thought about playing A here but the enlargement of my corner seemed more important to me than the enforcement of the A-group.

[JB\] This move does not add too many points to the corner, and helps white to strengthen its stones. On the other side, your stones are located in the vital points of the white kosumi, so it may not be so bad :-)]
;W[ck]
(;B[dk]C[[JB\] I´d prefer to cut (see Var.2). I do not like black's shape here.]
;W[bk]
(;B[ch]LB[di:A][dl:a]C[H: now i like A better then the stone i actually played. it would have given me a stronger wall.

[JB\] Yes, as you see in Var.2 it also protects the cut at "b".]
;W[di];B[ef]LB[dg:a][eg:b][ff:c][eh:d][qk:e][jd:f]C[[JB\] I would play "a" and, if white "b", black E14 (this one). Then white cannot hane again at "c", because the atari at "d" would make its left group too weak.
But there are bigger points like "e" and "f" to play now...
In brief, the game looks quite even but white has sente now.]
;W[dg];B[df];W[gh]LB[fh:a][dl:b]C[[JB\] This stone is not well connected (black can play "a"), but if black tries to cut he can weaken its D9 stones more. Notice that white can play at "b" in the future when K3-N3 cannot stop a ladder.]
;B[qj]C[[JB\] Good point];W[nc];B[pf];W[ld]LB[kc:a][pb:b][qc:c]
C[[JB\] I would play the standards "a", "b" or (probably better) "c"]

(;B[qm]LB[ic:A][oj:a]C[H: would a stone around A have been better? white gets pretty much territory up there in the end.

[JB\] Not sure. I probably would play near "A" but this one is big and indirectly helps N3. A good option would be "b" which has very good influence while encloses a big territory. If white plays R7 then you can play at A or protect the corner. See Var.2 as an example.]
;W[jd];B[hc];W[ic];B[hd];W[pl];B[pm]LB[ql:a]C[[JB\] I prefer "a". It is important to keep the stones connected, specially if you have weak groups so you need sente to strengthen them.]
;W[ql]
(;B[oo]LB[no:A]C[H: in retrospect i like A better.

[JB\] Yes. Anyway I would play like Var.2 probably.];W[rn];B[rm]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[np];B[lo];W[no];B[nn]
(;W[ol]LB[mn:a]C[[JB\] I would play "a"; cutting is more important than these two stones (eg Var.2).]
;B[rl];W[pj];B[qi];W[pi];B[ph];W[oh];B[qh]LB[pg:A]C[H: i think, A would have helped me as much while saving my territory even better

[JB\] The actual move is proper, I think. White cannot play at "A".]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]LB[pc:A]C[H: would the joseki to A have been better? i obviously wanted to keep my territory intact, but the other direction would have given me a stronger base to enter the center

[JB\] You can enter the center from the left and bottom - this one is good to protect your territory but "A" makes white weaker (see var.2).
In both cases the game looks even if no big groups are lost.]
;W[pc];B[oc]LB[bo:a][gl:b][pq:c]C[H: that was a mistake

[JB\] Yes. Probably you thought white was too big here, but he had only a couple of points more than your right group (depending on who closes the corner).
I would have played "a" or "b" now, or maybe attack at "c" (while white defends the corner, black can help its K3-N3 group by attacking O4-O5). But the left group looks more urgent.]
;W[od];B[ob];W[nb];B[rc];W[pb];B[oe];W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[mf]
;W[lf];B[mg];W[mh];B[og]LB[lh:a]C[[JB\] This one does not look bad, but trying to isolate the Q11 group without making it stronger would be good. Probably M12 ("a") is a good spot.]
;W[nh];B[lg];W[kf];B[lh];W[li]C[H: would there have been another way to run into the center without bildung white walls above and below?

[JB\] You helped white here: his two weak groups are strong now. Probably P13 lost one time.]
;B[ml];W[mk];B[nl];W[nk];B[kl];W[ig];B[gf]LB[hn:A]C[H: a stone around A would probably have been more valuable

[JB\] Yes. Now that te bottom is safe, you need to connect to the side too (no space for eyes there). This was a yose move; you need to make life sure before.]
;W[hg];B[hp]LB[gm:a]C[[JB\] Something around "a" could be better]
;W[gn];B[gp];W[fp];B[hn];W[go];B[hm];W[ho];B[io];W[hq];B[ip]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[gm];B[gl]LB[fj:B][dl:A]C[H: i nearly forgot my stones 'round A  in the moves before, but my attempt to rescue them was obviously wrong. i should have started by jumping out around B, right?

[JB\] I do not think they can be saved now...
White is about 20 points ahead now if these stones are considered dead, but you could use teir aji to make some good yose moves.
You recovered 10 points later and lost 5 points near the end.]
;W[hl];B[il];W[fl];B[hk];W[gk];B[hl];W[fk];B[jh]C[[JB\] This is a neutral point. There are bigger moves to play.]
;W[ki];B[jj]C[[JB\] Another neutral point. You do not need to conect 2 living groups.]
;W[ji]C[[JB\] White is playing neutral points too, maybe he is afraid of losing his group.]

;B[ie];W[jf];B[je];W[ke];B[id];W[jc];B[ib];W[jb];B[ha]LB[hb:a]
C[[JB\] Better at "a", same closing and less ko threats.];W[rb]

;B[ko];W[lq];B[kq];W[os];B[fq]C[[JB\] Very good! This move allowed you to shorten the difference a lot.]
;W[fr];B[fo];W[eq];B[fm];W[eo];B[fn];W[em]C[H: the following three black moves were absulutely in vain]
;B[el];W[en]TR[ia][ff][he][bg][ag][mr][rk][sl]SQ[ka][kb][fh]

thanks again!

[JB\] As I said, in fact you recovered some points in yose. 
P17 could be considered a mistake but in fact you did not lose many points there and it helped you play P15 in sente.
I think that the main mistake was to abandon the D9 group too much time.]

Black Q3 is dangerous and has to be read carefully by white. If white is not sure he can play Q3 or Q4; if black atari at N7 then white sacrifices his 3 stones and runs out with N6, attacking the bottom black group.]
