C[N: Hello, 

My comments are preceded by "N" additional questions or feedback are welcome.

Nelis (aka Lambic)

In this game, black started with a small-chinese formation, but failed to put i to use. After this white started to build a moyo,]

(;B[hp];W[cq];B[dr]
(;W[od]SQ[dj][fp]C[V: im not so sure if thats a good invasion point at this time ...

N: no i doesn't seem so. With the two marked moves, you started to build a moyo. Now you should stay consistent with this strategy. You should build your moyo further, so black is forced to invade.]

[cr:B]C[N: this looks like a moment to pauze and look at the position. It seems that black is slightly ahead on solid territory. But a lot of big area's remain. You now have the difficult task of trying to estimate wich of the areas is the biggest to play in, which is sente or reverse sente and which has the biggest follow ups. If however you are aware of how big these are, you can try to play tenuki's as soon as possible to play in one of them.]

;W[tt]C[N: In this game, black started with a small-chinese formation, but failed to put i to use. After this white started to build a moyo, but failed to play consequently and invaded. 
During the endgame, it was black who seemed to get most of the big points an subsequently won the game.
