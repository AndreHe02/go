dave: Hi Fred, I hope this review is helpful to you.  Please take my suggestions with a grain of salt!!  I am only 1d, so only slightly stronger than you.]
;W[de];B[pp];W[dc];B[jp]C[Better at K17?

--------


dave:  In my opinion, yes K17 would be slightly better.  Of course, there is nothing wrong with K4, but when you are playing a handicap game as black, you don't want to let white get any "ideal formations".  If white plays as in the variation, he pretty much has his first four stones positioned in the best way possible... you need to try to give him a hard time and take his key points so you can maintain the advantage.]

(;W[qn];B[ql]C[Pincer reasonable?

dave: yes this is a good move.  normally now, white should jump to corner or jump out at p6]

(;W[or]LB[nq:A]C[He loves this 2nd line invasion!  Never saw
it as a counter-pincer.

dave:  ahh what a tricky fellow!! well your first thought should be "he played a 2nd line move in the opening, that's definitely a mistake.  now how can I take advantage of it?"  A move that's sometimes played by white in this situation is A instead, but it is actually an overplay and a bad move against San Ren Sei.  Here Ill show you the typical variation for how to deal with it.  Given this information, p2 should actually be even worse, so let me show you some similar ideas for how to take advantage of it.  The key concept here is: If your opponent has two weak groups, don't let him connect them!! Then you can threaten his weak groups and reap benefits elsewhere on the board.  And since you have more stones around than him, you should welcome a fight.]

(;B[pn]C[Better response?

dave: this is not too bad, but r3 is the key point for getting the corner and keeping his stones separated, and making p2 look terrible]
;W[qq];B[qo];W[qj]
(;B[qh]C[Should have done more below?
S6, maybe?

dave: this is not too bad, though of course if you play here, you should have read ahead that he will be able to connect.  The logic behind this move is that even though he gets to connect, he doesnt have room for two eyes and you can build a territory in the top right while you attack it (see var a few moves down the road).  However, letting him connect like that indeed seems a little bit too passive.  I would play S5 or S6 to neutralize the stone.  I'm not sure which is better.  S5 is kinda neat because since you threaten the monkey jump to T2, you might be able to kill his corner group later.  But s6 is "thicker" than s5, leaves less bad aji]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[rl];B[pl];W[rk]C[Felt like I badly mishandled.

dave: this is not too bad a result for you.  You now have in interesting move at Q10 which seals white in and allows you to build a big wall which emanates strength throughout the rest of the board.]

(;B[jc];W[ob]C[Again!

dave: this is actually a pretty common invasion move in some situations.  The typical response is Q18. Ive included the two simplest variations]

(;B[pc];W[lc]
(;B[gc]C[Too craven?  Better at K15 or L15 or??,
and attack W's two stones?

dave: this is not bad.  But don't you wish you had played q17 at q18? Since white can slither into your corner and probably make an eye, i think it's gonna be kind of hard to attack this group.  But at the same time, those two stones are very weak, barely alive, so try to stay calm and play reasonably.  I actually like q18 now, though it looks quite slow.. I'm sure a stronger player would criticize my suggestion, but it seems like a key point.]
;W[qb];B[rc]C[Q18 instead?  Thought I was protecting something, but..]
;W[qf]LB[pg:B][qg:C][oh:D][pi:A]C[Didn't see it coming!

dave: I know this seems like a really annoying move, but really white is playing totally recklessly. You just need to keep his groups separated and attack them simultaneously, and good things will happen. The possible moves to keep white separated from his friend are ABC. If you jump to D, white will connect underneath.  The best one is B because it actually seems to kil white directly.]

(;B[pf]LB[qf:A][qj:B]C[I read this out for several moves but hallucinated, unfortunately, at a critical point.

dave: this is a pretty big mistake unfortunately.  you should know that in this situation, A can always connect with B]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[rh];B[ri];W[qi]C[Somehow I had misread what would happen right now.  Oof!
Had expected the upper B group to have a base.];B[ph];W[rg]
;B[oj]LB[pe:C][cg:D][oi:A][ok:B]C[Now I wanted to connect the upper and lower groups and use center influence as compensation for the bad losses on the right side.
But B35 looks weak, right now -- was there a much better way?  Or was I too ambitious?

dave: yes this is a bit too ambitious.  One thing I learned from Fernando Aguilar, Argentinian 7d, is that in go you shouldn't do things half-way.  If you are just "kinda" fixing a problem, it's better to just play elsewhere.  Since you are leaving cutting points and AB and C, there's not much point in trying to link up this wall.  It would be better to continue applying pressure to the top white group, which isnt really alive, or take the big point of D.  But on second thought, It is probably a bad idea to try to attack the top white group right now since your top right group is quite weak itself, so I like D.  But later on, you can aim at the sequence of Q18-Q19-N18 to render white's group baseless]
;W[pb];B[dj]C[Was my right side too obviously cuttable for a tenuki?

dave: this is a good move.  if you are thinking that you still need to fix your right side, then it was p10 that was a bad move]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[oh];B[ng]LB[pe:A][nh:C][ok:B]TR[pf][pg][ph][qh]
C[Worried about the marked stones
--here I thought I could chase the cutting stone and get some kind of profit in return.
 
dave: ya this move just really doesnt work, since you have so many weaknesses (ABC).  So it would be better to play a move like 014 and just escape with your weak group.  It's a fight but you don't really have to be too worried.  you have a lot of stones around the board that will be useful to you in a large-scale fight]
;W[nh];B[mg];W[mh];B[lg];W[lh];B[kh];W[lj]TR[oi][oj]C[But these marked stones have become weak.  I still imagined the top group could connect out if it had to, so I now focused on the bottom.]
;B[ki];W[mk]
(;B[ok];W[og];B[of];W[nf];B[me]C[dave: an unfortunate misread :(]
;W[ne];B[nd];W[pe]TR[ne][nf]C[Another misreading -- I had thought if W played there, B would capture the two marked stones.   So at this point, stopped recording -- with W's central group 
safe, it seemed that B still had to make the lower right group safe, and then there's
no game left, really.

I realize my misreadings were decisive, but would appreciate any comments on earlier direction of play errors, etc.]
