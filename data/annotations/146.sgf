C[Rob- Good so far. :)];W[qm];B[pi]L[oh][fq][fc]C[Rob- Not sure I like this.  The proper local move is a, but I think  it is too soon to make a move in this area. I'd prefer b or c.]
;W[pj];B[pn]L[rp][jp][fq][qo]C[Rob - I don't like this  much. At this point, your potential is in the corner, which this move leaves  open, and the bottom. This move doesn't threaten w, and if w wants, he could  do a to ruin the corner, or b to take the big point on the bottom. I feel b  or c is better for you. If you really the corner, then d is the right move.]
;W[qo]C[Rob- This is not a good response by  w.. I feel a or b would be better for him.]

(;B[qp]L[po][qp][jp]C[Rob- Here, w has  given you an opportunity. If you connect the peep at a, and w does b, then  you can do c. You would have a very solid moyo forming on the bottom! See  variation 1.]
;W[qn];B[jq]L[po]C[Rob - k3 is  not small, but the weakness at a makes it not as good as it could be..]
;W[po];B[oo]
(;W[on]L[op]C[Rob- I feel w HAD to  cut at a here. Seems things might have been tough for b if he did. See  variation 1.]
;B[nn];W[om];B[np]C[Rob- So  this works out well for you. Realize that a stronger player might have hurt  you here.]
;W[kp]C[Rob- I feel this sort of move is too early for w..];B[jp];W[ko]
;B[jn]C[Rob- a might be better here.  It  will be difficult to seal w in.]
;W[mo];B[no];W[lm];B[kn]L[nm][fp][kq]C[Rob- This move is what is called "aji-keshi". This means,  loosely, "loss of potential". When you push in at l6, w will surely connect.  That is what w wants to do. So you have forced w to do something he wanted to  do anyway, without gaining any advantage. Forcing moves are good if you gain  correspondingly, but bad if you don't.   I feel that a, b, or maybe c would be better..]
;W[ln];B[lq];W[nm]C[Rob- Now w is connected..];B[lp]C[Rob- This is a decent move. It removes much of the aji of a, and is sort of  sente.]
;W[lo];B[kl]M[dp]L[fq][fc]C[Rob- I'm not at all sure I see what this  move gets you. It gets a little thickness, but the marked stone reduces it's  value.. I think a or b are much better.]
;W[cn]C[Rob - Ow. w gets a territorial move in, and further reduces the  value of your thickness..]
;B[fq]C[Rob- Good.];W[cq]L[eq][fp][jc]C[Rob-  This is an awful move by w. FAR too slow. At absolute mininum, w should a. b  might be better. Really, c is what I would do, leaving this local situation..]
;B[eo]L[fo][fc][cf]C[Rob- Pretty decent. I think a might be  better. Really, I might wait to make a move like this, and take the big move  at b, or perhaps c, if you are worried about a big w side..   I think b is best here though.]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[qi];B[ph]C[Rob- This sequence is abysmal for w. He forces  you to take 20 pts and get thicker, while he gets maybe 5-8..]
;W[ni];B[nh]C[Rob - Good job to play along with w here. He is  doing you a big favor :)]
;W[en];B[fo];W[fn];B[gn];W[do];B[cf]L[fd][fc][jd]M[ka][kb][kc][kd]
[ke][le][ld][lc][lb][la][ma][mb][mc][md][me][ne][nd][nc][nb][na]C[Rob - This is a good move. I think a  might be better. Consider this: So far in this game, it stands roughly thus..

black: bottom-40pts  upper right 35.  a total of 75 solid pts with top  potential

white:  lower left- 12-15 plus a little thickness right side - 24 - a total  of maybe 40 plus right side potential.   You are up 35 pts, and are probably even in potential. If I were you, I'd do  a or maybe b. I might even get as wimpy as to do c. I don't think you need to  fight in w's area right now.   Even after c, look at the marked area's potential!

I'd probably do a here.];W[dh];B[ef];W[fd];B[dj]L[bh]C[Rob- Wow, this is a  strong move. I wouldn't have the guts to do this. :) I'd probably a .]
;W[fh]M[dj]L[bh][ci]C[Rob- I think w should have a or b here.. But this  is a tough situation. That's how strong a move the marked stone was :)]
;B[gg];W[ej]L[ci][cj][ch]C[Rob- I feel w must keep  you from going under him. Again, a or b would be better for him. Actually, I  think your last move might have been better at c..]
;B[dm]C[Rob- Yow!];W[dn];B[ch]C[Rob- Really good. You are muscling w around  here.]
;W[di];B[ci];W[cj];B[bj]M[di][dh][ej][fh]L[dk][dg]C[Rob- Still good,  I think you could have a here. w's marked stones are pitifully weak if you  do.. I know you are worried about the possible weakness at b, but somehow w's  stones are weaker than yours now. :)]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[dl];B[cl];W[em];B[gm];W[ff]L[bd][jc]C[Rob- This move is amazing bad for w.. He should a or b or  something. He has to at least reap some benefit on the top.]
;B[fg];W[eg];B[dg];W[eh];B[dj];W[el];B[ee]L[ed]C[Rob- w shivering in his boots now.. He should a, and  keep some of the top..]
;W[fe]C[Rob- very bad.];B[ed];W[ec];B[dc]C[Rob- really strong.];W[cd];B
[ce];W[fc]C[Rob- W has no good moves here. What a disaster for w..];B[cc]
;W[md];B[nd];W[ne];B[mc]L[me]C[Rob- I  feel you must cut at a here.]
;W[od];B[nc];W[me];B[oe];W[of];B[pe];W[mh];B[mg]M[ni][oi]L[mi]C[Rob- Again, I'd cut at a. The marked  w stones are short of liberties.   I realize I'm urging a more aggressive course here, where before I was  cautioning you against fighting when ahead. The difference is that here you  have local strength, and w doesn't, so you should fight.]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[mi];B[kh]L[nf][mf][lc]M[gg][fg]C[Rob- This  move should be a. If w shuts you in with b, his territory is still open on  the top at c, and the marked stones have a good bit of potential left to  them. Not to mention, you are so far ahead right now, that solid play should  be your first concern.]
;W[ng];B[og]L[pf]C[Rob- be a little careful with moves like this. You can end up short  of liberties. I think a might be better..]
;W[mf];B[kg];W[kj];B[gh];W[gj]L[gi][lc]C[Rob - This is a very weird  move by w.. seems it should be a. You should remember here, w's potential is  not so big in the middle. You still have b to reduce w while making pts on  the top.]
;B[fi];W[ei];B[fj];W[ek];B[gi]C[Rob- You do a nice job of taking advantage of w.]
;W[fk];B[hj];W[gk];B[ik];W[ji]C[Rob- a nice sequence  for you. Now w does you the favor of forcing you to connect..]
;B[ig];W[pf];B[qf]M[og]C[Rob- This looks unpleasant.. Remember the  shortage of liberties when you did the marked stone move?]
;W[jd];B[hd]L[kc][qg]C[Rob- Not wild about this. I'd a or b.];W[hc]
;B[id];W[ic];B[kc];W[jc];B[je];W[kd];B[lc];W[ld];B[lk]M[hd]C[Rob- Nice job to take  sente. I didn't like the marked move, but you played it well once it was  made.]
;W[lj];B[jk]C[Rob- Good, this is solid.];W[ll];B[kk];W[mk];B[dr]L[qg]
C[Rob - A very nice sense  of the big move. Good job. I still might a here.]
;W[cr];B[ds]L[eq][dq]C[Rob - The proper move here is a or maybe b..]
;W[cs];B[eq];W[qg]C[Rob- Ow! :(];B[rg];W[rh];B[pg];W[qg]C[Rob- Very painful.  However, you are so far up, it  doesn't matter, I think..]

C[
 mattson 17k*:  s4];B[rp]C[Rob- This is all desparation by w, and you handle it well, it  seems.]
;W[ij];B[ii]C[Rob - Nicely done to avoid that little  trap.];W[jj];B[hk]

;W[gl];B[hl];W[ep];B[fp];W[dq];B[er];W[eb];B[da];W[ea];B[lf];W[pc]C[Rob- Huh? :)]
;C[Rob- Nice  job. A few remarks: You're a pretty strong fighter for your level, and you  used it well in this game. I think you could try taking stock of the game in  midstream, and getting an idea of how risky to play from then on. Against  this opponent, for the most part you out fought him. But against better  players, if you manage to take a lead like that it might not be wise to play  for the fight quite as much.

Also, try to realize when you have sente, and see if it is reasonable to  break away from the local fight and make a big move somewhere.  The proverb  "play urgent, then big" is right, but realize when things are urgent and when  they aren't.    A final note: Try playing some stronger players without h-caps. Play some  20k's or so, and see how things go. That is a very good way to improve.   Also, feel free to send me more games to review, if you felt this one helped.  :)]

(;W[op]
(;B[oq]C[Rob- Here w can atari 1 of 2 ways. See variation the two  variations..]
;W[np]C[Rob- This looks very ugly for b.])
(;B[np];W[oq]L[no][rp]C[Rob -  Now b has weaknesses at a and b. Not a good looking fight.]
;B[nq];W[no];B[on];W[rp];B[pq];W[or]C[Rob- Clearly a tough fight for b. So  I'd say leaving the weakness at k5 was difficult, if you planned to block at  p5 when w pushed through. But w let you off the hook by not cutting you.  :)]
)))
(;B[po];W[qp];B[jp]L[qn][qq][pq]C[Rob- Here, w still has a weakness at a, and if he  descends at b or even hanes at c, he is solidifying your moyo.]
