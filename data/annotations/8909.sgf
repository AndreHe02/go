AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[rarellano: Hi reviewer.



This is a handicap game that was really difficult for me .I played white (rarellano 5k)  I'm really clueless about what was wrong (maybe black played very strong for a 10k  ) . Maybe I played to calm  . The game was over in midgame, but i extended to count to see how much was the point difference.



I put some stones in the review to see another posibilities. Tell me if they are better.



If you know some strategy in early game to play in this kind of games would be valuable.

Hi, my name is Jay.  And I will be reviewing you game.  My comments will start with "J:".]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[rarellano [5k\]: hi];W[pn];B[np]
(;W[qj]TR[qf][nc][fc][cn][cf]C[J: Since this is a high handicap game, you will need to make overplays.  R10 is OK in an even game, but in this situation, it's a bit slow.  Should approach another corner.]
;B[qh];W[fc];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[ec];B[dc]
(;W[hc]TR[kc]C[J: H17 can be play all the way at L17; which indirectly helps invading R17 later.]
;B[df];W[nc]TR[cn]C[J: O17 feels like the wrong corner to approach, should consider the lower corner.  Black cannot seal the top right corner with one move.]
;B[oh];W[pb]C[J: This slide is tiny, and invites black to protect his corner.  Without Q18, white has the option of invading at R17 or reducing at Q17 later.]
;B[rl]C[rarellano: severe by black]
(;W[qq]C[J: keeping your group connect is important here.  See variation.

J: The jump into the corner is just making more weak groups.]

C[J: living small is painful.];B[rn]TR[fq]C[rarellano: here i sart to save the white stones. should I had treated lightly and tenuki ?

J: the game has become very difficult for white now that black's O4 group is strong and thick.  Since there are no points to be made here for white, tenuki seems like the only option.]
;W[mn];B[oo];W[on]TR[mj][ko][lp][jn]C[J: The two stones are not worth saving.  Think about runing faster at marked points.]
;B[pk];W[jn]TR[nk]C[J: can play a move around O9 to make shape for the N6 grou and threaten to pull out R10.]
;B[lo];W[ln];B[ko];W[kn];B[ip]C[rarellano: thin white group, black makes profit.]
;W[dn]TR[fq]C[J: This high approach si rarely good. I would still suggest something around O9.  F3 is still weakness later, so don't touch the corner yet.]
;B[hn];W[il]TR[mi]C[J: it's dangerous to make a knight's move with so many black stones around.  where is white running? this way only helps black seal up the left side.  should run in the N11 directionn towards friends.]
;B[im]
(;W[jm];B[jl];W[kl];B[jk];W[lj];B[dl]C[J: White feels insurmountably behind now.]
(;W[lk]C[rarellano: i feel that white wasn't alive yet.];B[lh]
;W[ki];B[ih];W[kh];B[lg];W[kg];B[kf];W[oj];B[pj];W[ok];B[qi]
TR[ki][kh][kg]C[J: in hindsight, these 3 stones don't seem necessary right?]
(;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[eq];B[bp];W[bq];B[fp];W[gq]TR[ch]
C[J: Since white is alive in the corner, tenuki.  Consider C12.]
;B[fq];W[fr];B[gp];W[hq];B[ci]C[rarellano: here game over i think.  so...all the problems begin with the white weak group on center but i didn't know how to handle it.]

;B[bk];W[af];B[be];W[ae];B[de];W[ba];B[ab]C[J: Can resign here.

J: The main problem in this game is that white created too many weak groups and played slow moves.

J: In a high handicap game you want to place as many light stones as possible in the beginning of the game.  That means not losing sente and try to get white stones all over the board.]
