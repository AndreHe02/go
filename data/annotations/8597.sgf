C[Redgrave [1k\]: enjoy :)
barrauss [?\]: Hi, have a good game!
barrauss [?\]: Thanks :)
barrauss [?\]: ASR League
Redgrave [1k\]: ASR league

WOG: This is a classic battle between White - Aggressive Bully Overplay Master - and Black - Wimpy But Plays the Big Move When White Misses It.  

If I were asked to put the odds between bully vs. wimpy and dame vs. big move, I admit, I'd be at a loss for giving the odds... both are rather bad traits.  

Since Black asked for the review, the review is provided more for Black.  

I say harsh terrible things about Black's game.  I don't mean it to be mean or otherwise.  I mean it to improve Go.  Everyone should learn from Black and White's mistakes...]
;B[pd]C[Redgrave [1k\]: thanks, you too ^_^


WOG: You two are chatty during the game?];W[dn]C[WOG: Nice.  Not that this is the bomb move, but that it's a change up from normal... not a big fan of normal I am.]
;B[pp]C[Redgrave [1k\]: I shall do a new opening gambit :D

WOG: Revolutionary!!!];W[fd]C[WOG: Immediately, my thoughts are that White has worked out the joseki variations for this 6-4 move better than Black...]
;B[pj]C[My opponent was playing strange fuseki, so my instinct is to play securely. Typically at this point as black I like to approach a corner, but I'm unsure as to his intentions with the 6-4 stones. Influence? or just hoping I'll jump in to attack? So I opted to play this side to see what he did.

WOG: San-Ren-Sei is now the secure fuseki?!  I think not.  Secure is 3-3.   Secure maybe from one's comfort zone... nothing else.

My guess for White is that if you play the wrong approach and you don't know the joseki, you'll have a bad result.  If you're not trying to learn in this game (perfectly acceptable in tournament play), then play safe as you are... not because san-ren-sei is safe, but because it's your safety zone.]
;W[jq]C[Feels like he's trying to make a big corner to force me to invade. However, it's wide open, and do to K3 being low, I can also reduce if the need arises. Since F16 is emphasizing top side, I decided to play on the top side to reduce his potential up there, and increase my potential to invade on top if the need arises

WOG: RULE: Every good move has a good next.  What's the next move White plays that "makes a big corner?"  There isn't one that I know of.  This move is an intimidation move.   Please enter my corner...  I know more joseki than you.]
;B[jc]C[barrauss [?\]: Interesting.

Almost immediately afterwards I would rather this be K16. Giving white the option of K15 seems to work too well with his global moyo strategy should he adopt it.

WOG: Yes, this move is suboptimal from a RULE perspective of "Don't give your opponent a good next" the corrollary of the previous rule misunderstanding you had.  I'm seeing a trend in four moves... is it possible?]
;W[ji]C[Redgrave [1k\]: I call it...
barrauss [?\]: well now.
Redgrave [1k\]: the wtf chinese opening

Seems like he's attempting a global moyo strategy. I can still invade the corner, but that will build his influence. I op for the easy left side

WOG:

More intimidation.  Cool.  I like that White is scaring Black judging by Black's comments.  I don't like the randomness of the play though...  What's the good next from this stone?  J15 I guess?]
(;B[di]C[Redgrave [1k\]: that move does make more sense
barrauss [?\]: ^^


WOG: There's a RULE in Go called "Corner, Side, Center" for a reason - it's more efficient to surround corner territory than it is to surround side than it is to surround center...  

This move is what many Japanese pros would call "chicken."  It's avoiding the joseki possibilities in the corner.  Not good.  Corner, side, center.  Not side because there are no complicated joseki there.]
(;W[dk]C[WOG: Overconcentrated!!  Too close to the other White stone!  Direction is side, not corner, helping.  Boo!]
;B[de]C[Redgrave [1k\]: I even approached from the other direction this time lol
barrauss [?\]: haha

WOG: Better.  It's leaving a hole in the middle (not good IMHO), but at least it's toward the corner!  Hooray for that.]
(;W[dd]C[WOG: Doh!!!  Learn the RULE - Touch to defend, not attack.  While it's not 100% true, it's a good approach.  Here, White's play is already absent a liberty and gives Black a brilliant next.]
;B[cd]C[WOG: Naturally!  Terrible for White.];W[ce]C[Redgrave [1k\]: fight fight fight

WOG: OMFG... WTF  (read: Oh my friggin Go... White's terrible farce)

Is the assumption here that White is going to bully White's way to a win?  Does anyone really think this is reasonable play?  Oy.  

All that said, I'm trying to say, this is an overplay.];B[df]
C[barrauss [?\]: so aggressive

WOG: And Black taunts himself with this comment???  I don't get it.  Anyway...]
;W[bd]C[barrauss [?\]: can't we just enjoy each others company?
Redgrave [1k\]: XD
barrauss [?\]: oh my oh my
barrauss [?\]: excuse me while I pretend to read for a few moments.
barrauss [?\]: or rather.. try to read.
Redgrave [1k\]: yes, of course
Redgrave [1k\]: I like to pretend to read too sometimes lol

WOG: Ay yi yi! I'm running out of expletives.  Are you serious White?  This is bully Go at its best.]
(;B[ed]C[barrauss [?\]: yeah, I start reading.. then I get bored.
Redgrave [1k\]: interesting indeed
Redgrave [1k\]: LOL
Redgrave [1k\]: *screw this, CUT!
barrauss [?\]: And thing about things like the Avengers move.
barrauss [?\]: then realize I used up like 10 minutes...
Redgrave [1k\]: understandable lol
barrauss [?\]: then yeah, 'oh crap' *cut*
barrauss [?\]: Especially against weaker players

WOG: Doh!!! You take the bait, now twice!  You need to improve your reading and not be so afraid.  This is life, gosh darn it.  You can't be scared to read and play tough.  Seriously.  This is wimpy play. 

I don't mean to be pejorative about your Go, but you can't let this go on.  It's not good for you, it's not good for the opponent.  That said, you raise an important lesson for anyone reading this lengthy review after only 17 moves... 

In the locus of the most important RULES for Go are the RULES pertaining to the character of your play.

"Have the spirit to play the one best move (kami no itte)"

"Play with fighting spirit"

"Gambatte!"

I know I am all Japanesey about my rules, but hey, it's where and when I learned my formative Go.  Imagine there are equally, if not better, rules from China and Korea. In all, the rules speak to one inexhaustible pool of resource available to you as a player - the spirit of play.  

This move 17 makes me cry.  Are you serious?  Can you not read at 1 kyu?  Are you so afraid of complications that you will forego reading?  If this is a tournament game and reading is your absolute weak point, it's possible that this sort of Go can be forgiven.  Just looking at the board, I just see wimpy play.  Sorry, that's what I see. 

Moreover, you're doing a disservice to the stone played on the board.  The move at c16 is THE move on the board at its time.  You have basically told that stone, F*&K Y(#, I hate you and wish you never existed.

It's like in the LOTR ROTK (GIYF) when Denethor asks Faramir to retake Osgiliath.  Please, jump into a suicide mission, pointlessly.  Contrast this to the suicide mission of Aragorn when he goes to seige the Black Gate... that's real and worthy sacrifice.  Like Go's RULE of "sacrificing two stones instead of one."  Wow, what a contrast.  

Here, you've given White EXACTLY what White wanted.  While maybe you owe White nothing, White is a fellow Go player.  My hope for your Go is that you have the mind set to improve the world of Go players...  even when beating the pants off of them.  This move is a disservice to White's improvement as a player.  You've let those of us in the Go world down by making White continue in White's bullying Go ways.  White will not learn from White's successes when they're paved on the backs of the wimps that White has bullied.  White will only become more ardent in believing unbalanced Go is a way to play Go well.  It is not.  

Go is a beautiful game.  It means a lot to me and I imagine it means a lot to you since you've taken the time to submit this game for review.  Well, what can I say, you asked for a review... you're getting one.

All that said, I believe the right move here is C17 instead.  

ROTFLMAO (read: Read out the friggin' lousy moves antecedent obligating)]
(;W[dc]C[barrauss [?\]: ;.;

WOG: Oops.  White normally just takes here.  I understand there are no ko threats, but...]
;B[ec]C[Redgrave [1k\]: what especially against weaker players? o.O
barrauss [?\]: don't read/lose interest in a game
barrauss [?\]: and play bad moves
Redgrave [1k\]: lol

WOG: Now Black is happy.];W[ee]C[Redgrave [1k\]: Im a weaker player, hmmm? >:(

WOG: After my review of the preceding bullying plays and overplays by White, I will restrain myself and just say, this is an overplay... again.]
(;B[cf]C[barrauss [?\]: no
barrauss [?\]: I mean like against 5k's
barrauss [?\]: and 7k's
barrauss [?\]: I get in such bad positions
barrauss [?\]: because I'll get ahead after like 30 moves
barrauss [?\]: then start browsing wikipedia or something
barrauss [?\]: watch a lecture
barrauss [?\]: and then bam, I'm 50 points behind

WOG: What's with all the chatter?

Anyway...

This move is dead wrong.  You have a singular opportunity to pull out the once left-for-dead stone at c17 (truly the Faramir stone of this game) and save it.

This move violates the RULE - "Don't atari at random!"  The right move is to atari a different way.  Atari-ing at random is tantamount to a huge loss here.]
;W[eb]C[WOG: Right.  White has options now because you atari'd the wrong stone]
;B[cc];W[fc]C[WOG: The deadly turtle!  This becomes a nuisance later]
(;B[be]LB[cb:A]C[Redgrave [1k\]: lol I know the feeling

Would A have been better shape?

WOG: You end in gote either way... bad.  That you don't get to take back your moves, sure, consider A, but realize that A comes with serious aji... I don't recommend it... but people stronger than me should weigh in.]
;W[cb]C[Redgrave [1k\]: what kind of lectures?
barrauss [?\]: guo juan
barrauss [?\]: or something
barrauss [?\]: I also like to keep up with countsheep I think his name is

WOG: More chatter...

This move is too slow for White!  What's Black going to do here?  Some end game?  Seriously?  Bigger fish to fry here.]
;B[nc]C[Redgrave [1k\]: ah, cool :)
barrauss [?\]: he does these like little 10 minutes go lectures
barrauss [?\]: explaining common mistakes, or trick moves, that kind of thing, pretty nifty
barrauss [?\]: oh my, we have spectators
Redgrave [1k\]: yes, I know the one, I download all his videos :)
barrauss [?\]: I'm getting nervous

K17 was lonely, enclosing my corner

WOG: Nice move!  Yes, White missed an opportunity playing too locally, you took the opportunity to play a more urgent bigger picture move.  Congrats!  You're working your way back into this game...]
;W[nq]C[Redgrave [1k\]: don't be nervous! fight like a warrior! >:O

WOG: Good advice from Redgrave and good approach to this corner.]
;B[pn]C[barrauss [?\]: :x

WOG: two good moves in a row by the players...];W[no]C[Redgrave [1k\]: my wtf chinese opening seems to be working

WOG: Please don't insult the chinese opening this way... There's a giant gap!]
(;B[nm]C[Redgrave [1k\]: pretty soon, you'll see the pros using it
barrauss [?\]: Typical Gu Li.
Redgrave [1k\]: "Yes, I saw Redgrave use this and just HAD to use it!"
Redgrave [1k\]: XD

WOG: Misses the point.  The influence of this move is somewhat negated by the White stone at k11.  In a vacuum, this move is fine.  In reality, this move is not played in a vacuum... living Go my Black player.

You should enter the corner now.];W[mm]C[WOG: Lordy... at least White's consistent in White's overplays...]
;B[ml];W[mn]
(;B[nk]LB[ll:A]C[barrauss [?\]: Speaking of which, I'm so sad Na Hyun got destroyed in the semi finals :(

I think this was ultimately the losing move. I feel it should be A?

WOG:  The ultimate losing play... in comparison to e16, this move is golden.

Yes, this move is subpar relative to A.  It's overconcentrated. That said, the corner still beckons.]
;W[ll]C[barrauss [?\]: By Gu Li of course.

WOG: Heh... let's ignore the rest of the board.];B[lk]C[WOG: a pattern!  how pretty!]
;W[kk]C[WOG: Seriously?];B[kl];W[lm]C[WOG: If atari is not working, then just play flat... (local answer)

See variation]
(;B[kj]C[Redgrave [1k\]: I don't really keep up to date with pro games ^_^

WOG: Read before atari-ing!  Don't atari at random!!

See variations!];W[jk]
(;B[lj]C[Redgrave [1k\]: though yes I know I should
Redgrave [1k\]: and I do want to

WOG: OUCH!  Tewari tewari tewari!];W[jj];B[dq]LB[eq:A]C[Redgrave [1k\]: where do you see the game? eidogo?
barrauss [?\]: go4go.net
barrauss [?\]: gogameguru.com
Redgrave [1k\]: hm, I'll check it out
Redgrave [1k\]: I know eidogo updates with recent pro games too
barrauss [?\]: I play on Tygem too, and they usually broadcast big games

I felt a bit ahead here since I felt like I had the easier invasion here. But perhaps I should have trying to play more towards the right at like A? Not sure.

WOG: You just traded a wall facing real territory while you added three stones facing already secure territory... and you feel you're ahead?  In spirit, you're far behind.  Sure, the game is a game of territory, and again, if this is a tournament game, then I can see the approach (may not forgive it though).  

Finally, though, someone played in the corner... hooray!];W[eq]
C[WOG: I love this new supplement to Attack and Defense... attack by attaching... what a pioneer...

Seriously, this smacks of more bullying play...

BUT!  Again!  Go is not to be trifled with.  The attaching and bullying approach by White doesn't mean attaching will always be wrong.  

Circumstances change on the Go board all the time.  What's a 100% correct move now, may be 20% correct the next move.  What's 20% after the opponent plays wrong may make that original 20% move a 120% move.  

You can't use RULES of thumb as a blanket.  Attaching as a means of attack is not the rule, but it's the exceptions that prove the rule.

Here, we could read a LOT and still not be completely confident this attaching move is wrong.  That's not to say it's right, but one would have to read... a LOT!

My kneejerk reaction is White played this to invoke a wimp response (it worked) and not because White read out all the variations and given the circumstances (White's strong all over this area), White choose this line of play.  Not buying it.]
(;B[dp]C[Redgrave [1k\]: omg, I want to play on Tygem!!
Redgrave [1k\]: I don't think I can on my mac :(

WOG: If you read and counted, then play here.  If not, fighting spirit almost dictates that you play e4.  e4 teaches you something.  e4 is a smack in the face to White.  Sure, read, count.  Tell me I'm wrong.  But, I don't buy you've read and discerned this is best...]

People, please read my reviews.  I know, I'm a pain, but seriously.  If you read my reviews, I say the same G-D thing every game - Know The Four Questions RULE:

Where am I strong/weak
Where is opponent strong/weak

Play closer to weakness; away from strength

I cannot reiterate enough that at your level this has to be part of your everyday thinking!!!

A is farther from your strength than the move at 61!  L14 is even farther!]
