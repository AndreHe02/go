C[jcharles [9k\]: hi gg

[MAFU\]
Hello, i'm the reviewer ^_^ My name is Sebastian Heuchler, i'm a KGS 4k from germany (KGS: "mafutrct"). Feel free to have a look at http://senseis.xmp.net/?Mafutrct ;)

This is my first offline review, so i'm still unexperienced. Hope it will turn out to be helpful tho :>

I'm not a native English speaker, so please have some leniency with me. :)

Mainly reviewing for black, i'll try to speak my very thoughts without putting flowers into my words. Please do not feel offended when i call a move "unreasonable" or something. I just think you can learn the most this way ;)

If an expression is used which is not explained, look it up at sensei's lib ;)

I'll add a "[MAFU\]" before my statements (quite obvious, huh?).

Since you seemed to have a bit of trouble with standard invasions into 3 space extensions, i'll show you some common moves apart from the game.

Have fun ~_^]

C[[MAFU\]
Big point.];W[gq]C[[MAFU\]
This white move seems unreasonable. There are lots of bigger points than this.]

(;B[hp]C[jcharles [9k\]: *correct response?

[MAFU\]
H4 is kind of a touching move. Remember, do not touch what you want to attack. Also, there is no need to attack immediately.]
;W[gp];B[ho];W[go]C[[MAFU\]
White is pushing from behind (which is good for black), but the black wall is not very useful with Q4 and Q7 in place. :(]

(;B[nq]C[jcharles [9k\]: *too far?

[MAFU\]
No. Black is strong and white already has a weak group, so attacking your M3 weakness now cannot be good for white.]

(;W[lq]C[[MAFU\]
Unreasonable. White is again invading into Black's strength. Now he has 2 weak groups!]

C[[MAFU\]
A big move, but the framework in the upper right is most important now.]

(;B[ql]LB[qm:A]C[[MAFU\]
I do not like this move. If white just defends with A, all aji will be gone and white is even strong enough to attack black in the center.]

(;W[ng]C[jcharles [9k\]: *how to respond to an invasion like this? I'm very open on the right side, is it right to block as I did?

[MAFU\]
There are a few things to remember when facing this situation.

First: count the points.
I roughly see 30 points for black and 40 for white, but black has lots of potential.

If you are very ahead on points, just defend a reasonable part of the framework without attacking too firmly.

If you are way behind, attack firmly and try to push the opponent out of your terr in sente, then defend your backyard (3-3).

If the game is about even on points, it becomes most interesting :)
You actually have to read the possible sequences carefully. See my variations.]

This is a natural defense.]

(;B[le]C[[MAFU\]

C[[MAFU\]
Your sacrificing idea is very cool.

The problems here is, you still have to worry about both A and B :(

In the actual game you managed to defend both, but the aji itself these points leave is not very good for black. :(]

Nice game. Let's have a summarized look:

You mostly played very reasonable moves. Few overplays. I really like your steady style. White was more agressive and a bit overplayish, esp. in the fuseki, he did fight better than black but he lacked balance.

Black should try to learn more midgame joseki and fighting moves to punish overplays better. Knowledge of shape is also never wrong.

Yose (endgame) was a bit poorly played by both players (imho), so if you feel like it, you can get any nice book on this topic. No need to really get everything, just grasp the general idea of yose (like, "when you're alive, yose starts" or "double sente first").

As i always do, i recommend having a look at goproblems.com. There are a few very interesting problems there. Also, try searching specifically for fuseki and yose problems (solve just a few simple ones, these might help you the most).

Hope this review was interesting and useful for you :)
Please let me know your opinion about it ;)

This sequence resembles sabaki. Comparing to the other variation, the D7 E7 exchange is bad for black, since black is less flexible now. Therefore, wedging in at D7 is a bit worse then just C7.]

There is a good chance that black will ignore this move and attack, so D7 is bad.]

The 4th line is more interesting for 2 reasons:
a) It enables you stronger attacks against G3.
b) C11 makes black kind of flat. Note that white can press you down to become completely strong in the center.]

Probably this is a better way for white, since he is less weak and black is a bit under pressure. Still, the result is good for black.

On the other hand, Q7 looks better now, so this is too good for white.]

There is no need to attack G3 right away. D15 is very big and after any joseki played here, black will probably get a chance to profit from w's weak stone at G3 later.
