C[Pierre-Normand Houle (gostone on IGS 17k) : I was playing white in this
game. I made a few sacrifices to keep sente and I feel that I might not have
had to do some of them if my position had been more solid. I am sure I made
many strategic mistakes as well. I'd be grateful for you to point out my blind
spots as I didn't feel I made many errors in this game but I do not trust this
feeling at all. It seems I didn't get much from my central moyo. Thanks in
advance for your taking the time to go over this game.];B[pd]

;B[md]C[this is a mistake. There's really no value in separating the white stones, and
black has much more pressing things to do.];W[qe]C[PNH:
I didn't find a good followup to this squeeze tesuji although I made some
profit.];B[pe];W[pf];B[qe]C[this looks very bad for black.  (See previous comment)]

A or make a base with B];B[ql];W[pk];B[qo];W[pn];B[qn];W[mn]
C[black looks much better now.  White will be very hard pressed to make
any territory with his inward-facing wall.];B[pp];W[lp];B[ld]
C[this is really unnecessary.  The stone black is defending is expendable.]
;W[lf]LB[ke:A]C[white shouldn't have answered either.  White would love to chase
this black stone if black were gfoolish enough to try to escape it.
If white MUST answer, just extend at A];B[pj];W[oj];B[pm];W[om]
;B[qm];W[no]LB[ok:A]TR[no]C[PNH: This was bad, I now realize. I think "A" might have been better, right?

Yes. The multiple cutting points in the vicinity of A are a real problem.]

C[Black is looking pretty good about now.  White has lots of heavy stones,
but not much potential territory.];B[fq]C[good choice.];W[dn]
;B[iq]LB[cl:A]C[my instinct is that black should pincer at A and contest both sides.  Black
has a territorial base, and will win if he can prevent white turning his wall
into a center territory.  Black wants to move into the center, not to secure
small territories on the side.];W[hp];B[hq];W[gp]LB[jl:B][ip:A]
C[A would be better.  White should aim to force black into a small side,
and form a territory centered on B, so he should keep connected to the
wall.];B[fp];W[fo];B[ip]C[definitely.];W[io];B[jo];W[in];B[kp]

would be to invade the center, maybe at A or B];W[df];B[gj]
;W[hj];B[fi];W[kl]C[good idea.  At last some territory for all those stones!]
;B[im]LB[ih:A]C[not a good choice.  The battle now is for white to make a lot
of territory in the center.  The big point is somewhere near 'A']

C[very good move, but it has been sitting there waiting to be made for
a long time.  Don't feel bad, I didint'see it either.  But now that it is there,
the Ko is so huge black must win it.];B[kh];W[jf];B[kf];W[aj]

threat at A.  Big enough that white should answer I think.]

Aside from teh big Ko, which is admittedly tricky to play, both players played
a pretty reasonable game tactically.  White's weakness is in seeing the overall
