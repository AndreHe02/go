C[Review by plasma, 5k* NNGS, and probably 5 kyu in the UK.

This review requested by Black.];B[pq];W[dd];B[po];W[dp];B[pd]
;W[jp];B[jd]LB[cj:a]C[Hmm, this is probably fine. But on the other hand, I'd consider a wedge play at 'a', splitting White up and maybe making the game more interesting.]
;W[dj];B[lp]TR[pq][po]LB[pj:a][jj:b][fc:c][fq:d]C[This doesn't look like an efficient extension from the corner...the triangled stones aim for a large territory to their left, but this can't happen do to the white stone. I'd probably play one of the points 'a' through 'd'.

On the other hand, the move does prepare for your later invasion near 'd', so perhaps it's good after all.]
;W[qj];B[qh]LB[ql:a][qc:b][pc:c]C[R12 feels like the wrong direction to me. I'd play at 'a' instead, the reason being that it makes the lower right corner reasonable secure, whereas after your move the top right can still be invaded, probably at 'b' or 'c'.]
;W[qm];B[qn]C[Now the territory in the lower left is smaller, and the top right still open to invasion.]
;W[pm];B[gq]TR[lp]LB[hp:a]C[Yes, why not? This seems to work well with the triangled stone. But I think I'd prefer a more severe attack on the white stone, such as 'a'.]
;W[io];B[dr]LB[go:a]C[In a situation like this, it's usually better to jump out to 'a' rather than live on the side. In fact, White's answer is very good, and he gains a formidable all facing the centre, but he spoils it by trying to kill you.]
;W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gp];B[hq];W[ir]LB[cq:a][hp:b]C[This is surely wrong - Black is in no danger. For example, a black move at 'a' seems to secure life.

White should probably secure his wall with a move at 'b', which fully punishes Black for living on the side. The wall would have such a strong influence on that whole quadrant of the board that it must be a mistake for you to allow this at all. Hence why you should have jumped out earlier.]
;B[hr];W[iq];B[hp];W[ho];B[go];W[fp];B[gn];W[im];B[dn]C[And Black now reaps the benefits of White's mistake.]
;W[do];B[eo];W[cn];B[cm];W[en];B[dm];W[em]LB[fo:a]C[Curious. 'a' seems obvious.]
;B[fo];W[gm];B[dq];W[ep];B[cp]C[Yes, quite.];W[hn];B[co];W[nc]
;B[nd];W[md];B[oc];W[ne];B[od];W[mc];B[me]TR[jd]LB[pf:a][gd:b]
C[This is rather aggressive. Given the phenomenal amount of territory you've won in the lower left, you can probably get away without going into this sort of violent struggle.

Also, note that the triangled stone might become a bit weak.

Perhaps play 'a' instead, or something like 'b' to help the triangled stone.]
;W[le];B[mf];W[nf]LB[je:a]C[I think I'd let the stone go and make sure my other group got out, eg with a move at 'a'.]

(;B[mg]LB[ng:a]C[I suspect this is a bit weak. Playing at 'a' instead is much more severe.

It gets a bit complicated though. See variations.];W[ng];B[nh]

[oh][pg][ng][nf][ne]C[Well, you seem to have come out of all that very well. The triangled stones look quite, quite dead. Still, you'll have to remember to be careful with how many liberties your own stones to the left of them have.]
;B[gc];W[kd];B[kc]LB[jc:a]C[At 'a' instead looks more solid.]
;W[je];B[id];W[hf];B[jh]TR[li][lh][lg][mg][mf][me][jh]C[Hmm, I'd worry more about the group at the top. You can make sure the triangled group lives at any time by actually capturing the stones on the right and taking them off the board.]
;W[ji];B[ih];W[qp]C[Yes, this is a severe weakness of this formation.]

(;B[ro]LB[rn:a]TR[pm][qm][ok][pj][pi][qj]C[I'd probably play 'a' instead, which is more severe on the White group on the right, which already looks close to death.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[qq];B[pr];W[oo];B[on];W[oq];B[or]LB[no:a]C[I'd just capture at 'a' and let the 2 stones go.]
