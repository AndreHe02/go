C[Hi,

This game was played on KGS recently.

Thanks for the review,

Tim

J: Hi y name is Jay, and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments start with "J:".]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[qo];B[np];W[pm]MA[qk][ql]C[J: This extension seems too slow and doesn't work well with the top side.  When white is high like Q7, it makes R9 sente for black later.  An extension to R8 or R9 is normal.]
;B[qp]C[J: Black is doing good punishing white here.];W[po]
C[J: White need to avoid over-concentration and play elsewhere.]

;W[gq];B[cl]C[J: Since black is so strong on the top left, black can extend all the way to C6.]
;W[ci];B[el];W[ei];B[ff];W[bf]C[J: very nice tesuji by white.]
(;B[bg]C[J: B13 is going to end badly for black, because white can settle his group.  See variations.]
;W[cg];B[cf];W[bh];B[be];W[ag]MA[el][cl]C[J: This trade is very bad for black since white is practically alive now, and C8 group is still weak.]
;B[cp]C[J: Black can also play B4 to remove complications.]
;W[cq];B[co];W[dq];B[do];W[kq]MA[oq][op]C[J: white can extend all the way to M3 looking at the P3 weakness.]
;B[jc];W[he];B[je];W[if];B[kf]MA[kg]C[J: Black can be greedier and extend to L13.]

[rl][sl][gb][ga]C[This is the point I often feel lost in games, when the middle game opens up like this. Where to attack or develop? Are there some principles to follow here so I can have some direction where to play?

J: a very good way to decide what to do next, is to take a count.  By pessimistically finishing groups, we see that black is ahead by about 15 points.

Since black is ahead, it is white's job to complicate the game.  The circled points are interesting for black now.]
;B[iq]LB[jp:A]C[I also thought maybe reducing at A would be good

J: J3 is unreasonable.  A is good.];W[ko];B[io];W[go];B[jr]

;B[fr];W[er];B[jn];W[kr];B[hs];W[mr];B[rh]MA[rf][mm][gh]LB[ph:A]
C[I think this was stoo deep. Maybe A is better?

J: S14 is the normal reduction. S12 can lead to disaster, see variation.

For now, the white N2 group is not alive yet, so black can put pressure  with a light move like N7.  G12 is interesting too, since it attacks J12.]

Thanks in advance for your review.

Tim

White wins by 2.5 points.

J: So the key take away from this game is to learn to judge the position of the game.  We do this by taking a count of the territory.  When we that we are ahead, we sit back and play large endgame moves.  If we are behind, we complicate the game to get an advantage.

In this game, you were ahead going into the middle game.  it would actually be ok to play solidly and force the game into endgame.  This is a calm way to play.

The other thing to note is to recognize what groups are weak, and to attack from a distance.

Thanks for showing me this game.])
