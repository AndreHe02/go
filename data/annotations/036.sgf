[on];W[qq]C[jrm: Perhaps too early to invade in a 4
stone game. By waiting, the surrounding  situation may make a different corner invasion better.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[lo]
;B[ip]C[jrm: This doesn't put any pressure on White's
3 stones and still leaves the corner open.
Perhaps F3 instead. If White tries to split F3 and L3,
L3 can connect with Black O2. If White plays on the O2
side then Black can make nice territory.];W[cf];B[jd];W[fd];B[ee];W[fe]
;B[ef];W[dh];B[fg]C[jrm: I'd prefer a move that pressures White
more, this is simply running away.];W[cd]C[jrm: This is going to force Black to weaken
the F15 stones. D12/C14 are stronger. Push
Black against them instead.];B[dc];W[hc];B[ic];W[he];B[md];W[hg]C[jrm: Those 4 stones must be saved now, this
was a need move. It also pressures F13 group.
I wonder if G13 was better though.];B[gh];W[gg];B[fh];W[cq];B[cp]C[jrm: Black should play on the other side I think.
Black makes territory while keeping White low.];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq]
;W[fr];B[gq];W[gr];B[hr];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[cn];W[ck]C[jrm: Right side more important. Black can
pressure the 3 O/M stones and then make a
big move on the right with strength at top  and bottom.];B[ei];W[rm]C[jrm: This just allows Black to narrow gap on
the right side providing for an even bigger
Black play there. Better played near star point.];B[ql];W[hh];B[hi]C[jrm: One of the things White tries to do in
a handicap game is to cut Black into many pieces
while maintaining at least the potential to connect
all White's groups. This game is already exactly the
opposite. White is relatively safe but has 5 groups
to make live independently; Black is potentially one
or two groups! I think White needs to allow Black to
take more corner territory and build center influence
instead.];W[ii]C[jrm: This helps Black make an eye. Maybe this
should be around K14 which keeps Black from
making the top moyo deeper and makes eye space
for White.];B[hj];W[ij];B[ik];W[hk];B[gk];W[hl];B[gl];W[hm];B[gn];W[jk]
;B[dj];W[cj];B[dk];W[gm]C[jrm: Should save this move for after D8 and
a few more moves have been played. Played now,
it lets Black add a defensive stone early.];B[fm];W[dl];B[el];W[di];B[dm]
;W[cl]C[jrm: Not real small, but still an end game point.
There are more important moves.];B[in];W[im];B[jn];W[nn];B[nm];W[mm]C[jrm: P5 threatens to cut at Q5. Maybe O2 first,
threatening to connect underneath, then P5.
If Black responds in the obvious ways, then P7
is atari and so will be this move.];B[nl];W[ml];B[mk];W[lk];B[mj];W[oo]
;B[po];W[nk];B[ok];W[qf]C[jrm: Good ladder break timing!];B[rd];W[qi];B
[oi];W[rl]C[jrm: White should threaten to live/connect
with, for example, P13 then P15, instead.
If Black prevents life/connection to H13, then
White connects with S9 and has reduced Black's
center. This would leave White with peeps against
the top to reduce it or at least keep it small.];B[qk];W[rk];B[lj];W[kk]
;B[jh];W[ki]C[jrm: This seems small. P14, P15, etc. would
be more points. C17 is probably bigger.];B[lh];W[kh];B[kg];W[li];B[mh];W
[mi];B[ni];W[kj]C[jrm: Leave this for end game or at least make
other sente plays first.];B[nj];W[jg];B[kf];W[jf];B[of]C[jrm: This point is bigger than White's previous
move at K14.];W[je];B[ke];W[id];B[kc];W[cc];B[qj];W[rj];B[qh];W[rh];B[pi]
;W[ri];B[jm]C[jrm: Not sente.];W[ib];B[jc];W[jb];B[kb];W[qc]C[jrm: This is a tough (impossible?) invasion.
R16 would give some leverage against Q16 and
S16. It may only be a few points, but better
than losing a handful of corner stones.];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[rc];W

 JamesL 17k : m8 was a nice move, i resign

jrm: In summary, I think White worried about edges
and corners too much. Instead White should try to
divide Black while leaving room to keep most White
groups connected, i.e., establish a strong center
influence first, then invade corners.])
