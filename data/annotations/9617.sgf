Yes, it’s weaker shape, and hence usually white will end up with worse result, even if there is immediate punish variation.]

I don’t think continuing is good, because...]

If you want to capture those stones, more grand scale move here would be more efficient. Generally, you don’t actually care if S6 gets eaten, as it does not really serve a purpose anymore, so you’d rather strengther your outside, with a move like A for example.]

;W[di]C[Before attacking, you need to to determine what you actually want to gain from attacking. Usually killing is not good option, though here, as you are so strong everywhere, you may actually want to try to snatch atleast a portion of white’s center stones.

But first black needs to prepare so white won’t have forcing moves for living shape...]

(;B[ej];W[ei];B[fj];W[fi];B[cj]C[This is bad shape, as there is now multiple cutting points on black’s shape, in a way turning the situation upside down.]

Yes, as you should atleast be able to link it in sente (while disconnnecting black, so J14 would actually have any meaning)]

-- I don’t really see what white’s P12 would do. Give 1,5 points to white? It gives at least 2 points to black, so it’s not exactly the most efficient move for black either.]

(;B[nq]C[I couldn't read if that was necessary   in the game  ... guess it was

--

Yes. 

Even if the vars immediately worked for you, having that kind of big weakness is PITA, as you’d need to be aware of it all the game, and may force you to respond more passively, and hence ultimately costing you points.]

Yes, it’s big move, but more of as it’s sente for white, not because it’s big on points.]

and i wonder if it's not too late to kill the middle group ...

--

It’d require good mistakes from white to get it dead... I admit it’s at the moment it’s more fragile than it was before, but still, A gives  immediate eyes, and B and C may be useful on abusing upper weaknesses, D and E may be able to create something on weaknesses there and F for the weaknesses on side. Because white already has 1,5 eyes even after black A, it’s really, really hard to actually kill white.]
