;B[pp]C[Hi,     before we start some general remarks.     * I앐 no realy strong player,so don앖 take it to seriously what I앐 saying.     * If something is unclear or you have further questions, don앖 hesitate to ask.     * It is the first time I use this programm for commenting, please tell me if this file is completely readable for you.     * You can앖 improve by getting commented just one game. Try to use my hints, play more games and send in games for commenting from time to time.     * I think it is easier for you and more helpful if you play against opponents who are even in strenght with you or only a little stronger.     * Traditionally black plays his first stone in the upper right corner. (it압 only more polite to do so)]
;W[dd]C[When you get more practice you will improve your technique automatically, but it is much harder to develop the strategy and principles on your own.   Instead of commenting every single move I want to talk to you about some principles.



The aim of the game is to surround more territory than your opponent. Thus before playing a move you should think about which one is the best.

And that is the most important principle. Don앖 play in an area just because your opponent played there, don앖 continue to play on groups that you can앖 kill anymore or that are already dead. Play where you think it is most effective !

This sounds very simple, but it isn앖. I앏l show you some moves in your game :-)



One additional remark: Of course it is helpful to kill groups, but you must be sure you can kill it at least if the opponent doesn앖 answer your threat immediately.

And there are situations when playing elsewhere is bigger than killing.  
You see, go-strength depends a lot on experience. That압 why you can only improve step by step.]
;B[pc]C[The second thing I recommend you to think about is: Try to play only moves you understand !



There always are a lot of possible continuations from a single move and as beginners we both often don앖 know which one is the best. But even more important than to play the absolutely best move is to have an idea, to follow it and (perhaps) get the result you wanted.

You learn more of it because you can compare your plan and the result.

Second youre less dependent from your opponent, you can play your own game, you can act not only react.



But from time to time during a game you must estimate who has the lead. And if you think you are behind you sometimes must take a higher risk and play some more difficult moves.]
;W[dp]C[enough of the theorie, let압 have a look on your game]
;B[pj]C[nice opening];W[nq];B[pr]C[You don앖 have to defend the corner now, there are bigger moves and the corner territory is neither totally safe if you play (except you play on the 3-3 point) nor totally lost if you don앖 play.   
But your move isn앖 wrong, just a bit slow.



- principle 1 ?];W[kq];B[mp];W[mq];B[np];W[qq]C[At this moment it is to slow for white too!]
;B[oq]C[R4 would be better, because W can connect or live in the corner anyway. But a strong wall on the 4th line would help B to make territory on the right side.   - principle 1]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro]
(;B[rn]C[very aggressive!    you can play like that but I앐 not sure if you realy read it out before !?

- principle 2

C[W is out now and can live easily

;B[pk];W[qe]C[Don앖 count on mistakes by your opponent ;-)]
;B[rl];W[qh]
(;B[qf]C[Again very aggressive. You can앖 and you needn앖 kill everything! There is space for white to live in the corner or to escape into the middle.    It is much more effective to attack indirect and make territory by yourself while attacking.    - principle 1 (and 2)

see variation for one possibility];W[rf];B[rg];W[qg];B[pf];W[rh]
;B[re];W[sg];B[qd];W[oh];B[ph];W[pg];B[pe];W[pi];B[og]C[W didn앖 play very well so you got the corner and the chance to extend along the upper side (around L16).   
This would be a great success. you can앖 kill this white group so better play elsewhere instead of the following fight up to move 135 -in the end  W got the whole upper side, B only a weak group in the center

;B[ji];W[lf];B[kj];W[me];B[kg]C[for every move from 57 to 77 see comment on 57    now it is to late to extend this far, but you still can make territory on the upper side and you still achieve nothing by attacking fiercly    btw, W didn앖 get weak groups like you, but could have played much larger moves too, instead of joining you in the battle



61, 63, 67 and others are even good examples for what I said about principle 2]

;W[mh];B[ke]C[This group has no eyes, there is no space to make some, it can not be connected to any other group and it is surrounded by very strong W groups.    It is just dead, so leave it alone.    If you continue playing at this group you only strengthen W.

I hope my comments are helpful for you and don앖 think you played to bad because I commented mostly on your mistakes, that압 the sense of commenting a game.



One last remark.

If youre sure you can not win a game any more, resign and play another one, it is more interesting for both players.



Have some nice games
