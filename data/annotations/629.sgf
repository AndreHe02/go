further analysis
starts with move
#38];B[dc];W[pp];B[qd];W[cp];B[ce];W[jc]C[good idea;  I understand many
play this in response to the combination like d17,c15.  If it were played at j17, it would give you a perfect
extension both to f17 and m17, and then to p17 ... not
that you would be allowed all these but it does set up
possibilities.];B[oc];W[fc]C[This extension
is too wide considerring the  presence of the four black
stones at the top.  I think g17 or n17 would have been
better.  Then you would have had an excellent chance of
an eye on the edge and access to the centre, which you
wouldn't have to spend time defending and thus allowing
black to build up strength while attacking the white
stones.];B[lc];W[qj]C[a good spot.  The two
stones at the top are very weak,
however.];B[hc]C[Yes, good
move.];W[hd];B[gd];W[gc];B[id];W[ic];B[he];W[hb];B[hd];W[kd]
;B[kc];W[jd];B[ec];W[cj];B[eq];W[dq];B[ep];W[hq];B[dp];W[cr]
;B[gq];W[ho];B[hr];W[iq];B[dr];W[cq];B[fr];W[cn]C[Your moves at the bottom of the board
seem very strong; you have many points on the left edge
and black is still not assured of life.  Often this can
be used not so much to capture him but in pressuring him
to defend one can make many points around his
possition.];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[on]C[yes, this is good against the two black stones
and r10 can  extend in either
direction.];B[op];W[or];B[nr];W[oo]C[I'm not so sure about this one; the double attack
of black q3 followed by q5 could be trouble; I might have
played q5.];B[po];W[pn];B[pq]C[well
black has done it the other way, which is safer for him.  Had white played q5 earlier black would still be in
trouble
here.];W[qp];B[pr];W[qq];B[jq];W[mn]C[Not bad; you're staking out a fair amount
of territory here. Another possibility was L3 keeping
pressure on both black groups.];B[ir]C[Black now
appears to be safe at the
bottom.];W[io];B[qg];W[oi]C[This
feels a little passive to me; maybe c13=better,
threatenning to cut through on line f and strengthenning
c10];B[fd];W[jh]C[I like this move.  If you
want to stop black's moyo in the upper left, however,
this might be the time (with
c13).];B[ch];W[ej];B[eh]C[Yes, the
damage is done and your territory in the centre is not
strongly surrounded.];W[gi]C[This helps a lot.];B[gh]C[Helpful in protecting black moyo, but
white's is bigger and  so l5, n14 or somewhere around k12
(perhaps k14) might be better for
black.];W[hh];B[gg];W[hg];B[hf];W[ig];B[if];W[kf];B[jf];W[kg]
;B[ke];W[le];B[je];W[ld];B[md];W[mf]C[I prefer n15 at this
point threatenning n17 and if black plays m14, either n13
or n14  will capture.];B[ne]C[Here is another
reason for white n15; black now has another large strong
corner.];W[og]C[good
spot];B[of];W[ng];B[en];W[gm];B[el];W[fk];B[cl];W[bl];B[bk]
;W[bm];B[ck];W[ko]C[White
now has a very strong centre.];B[di]C[One should
never make a play which forces the opponent to strengthen
himself; this seems to be all black is doing here (yes,
and I still do it too  :)  ).];W[dj];B[fi];W[gj];B[kp];W[lp]
;B[lq];W[jp];B[kq];W[mp];B[mq];W[mo];B[jg];W[lh];B[qo];W[ro]
;B[qn];W[qm];B[qi];W[pj];B[pi];W[oh];B[pg];W[bj];B[ak];W[aj]
;B[cm];W[bn];B[dn];W[em]C[too bold

r2 is worth 7-11 points compared with the final result
(enough to win).];B[fm];W[fl];B[fn];W[gn];B[ek];W[fj];B[qr]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[sq]C[t2 is better (worth a
point).];B[sr];W[rn]C[Yes, I agree.  Without this move, black s6 followed by black t4 could
have been
trouble.];B[rj];W[rk];B[sj];W[sk];B[ri];W[ql];B[jb]C[Black could
have done better here with g18.  If white follows with
f18, black j18 captures at least four white stones.  I
Think that's right.  Check it out if you
want.];W[ib];B[kb];W[fb];B[eb];W[fa];B[go];W[gp];B[fo];W[fp]
;B[fq];W[hp];B[jn]C[not much
hope for this
stone];W[jo];B[in];W[dk];B[dl];W[al];B[dm];W[ag]C[good
jump];B[bf];W[af];B[ae];W[bh];B[bg];W[ah];B[hn];W[gl];B[ln]
;W[lo];B[kn];W[jk];B[hi];W[ih];B[ij];W[hj];B[ii];W[ik];B[ji]
;W[kh];B[kj];W[ki];B[jj];W[kk];B[lj];W[lk];B[mj];W[mk];B[nj]
;W[oj];B[nk];W[no]C[not necessary; your bamboo joint of n5,n6,p5
and p6 are strong enough; I think I would have let black
go here and played
d1.];B[hl];W[hk];B[ml];W[bi]C[c11=better (worth a
point)];B[mm];W[kl]C[good];B[ll];W[hm];B[nm];W[om]C[good:  eye
killer];B[ol];W[ok];B[km]C[black has
no eyes];W[pl];B[jl]C[... and white's
centre chains are all
safe];W[il];B[me];W[lf]C[not
necessary

d1=better];B[nf];W[mg]C[still not
necessary; these two moves cost you two points.

In general a very good game free of major mistakes.

This is my last comment.  Let me know if you have any
questions or comments on my comments.  It was a pleasure
to review your game.
