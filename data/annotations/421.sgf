(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]C[I played this as with aji who is 6k* on NNGS.  I evetually won it but  only after saving a large group and killing one of his.

;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[ep];B[pk]C[I intend to use a "large moyo" strategy here.]
;W[cp];B[de]C[I figured I couln't let him have shimari's at both corners. 

AB: This is probably correct, though a move on the lower side is also very important.]
;W[ce]
(;B[dd]C[I chose this joseki as I was planning to get thickness on the upperside which would work well with my moyo on the Right. 

AB: I am not a joseki expert, but I know that this joseki can easily get very complicated and you may end up with a disadvantage (in fact, you do in this game). The choice of this joseki might be correct, but choosing the simple variation (see variation) will certainly be ok, since you get the ideal extension on the left side that also white is aiming for.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[db]C[I hesitated here, as W-D18 was not joseki, but I wasn't sure how best to answer it.

AB: You play should not be to dependent on joseki. Rather, try to find reasons, why a joseki move or a move in a professional game is good. I cannot see anything particular bad in the White move, it seems very natural to me.]
;B[cc]C[I took a daring move to sacrifice this to help with my outside wall in sente. 

AB: I don't know the variations in this joseki and do not have a joseki book, but the sacrifice seems ok to me.]
;W[cb];B[bc];W[bb]
(;B[df]C[AB: A hane should be possible (see variation). If you sacrify two stones in the corner you must now start to use them. If your original intention was to play 17 (D14) you could have played it without the sacrifice.]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[cf]C[AB: Now it's pretty obvious that in the top left White is much better off. After 20 the two sacrified stones are wasted. The territory White gets there is very big compared to the outside influence for Black (part of the reason is that the upper side is open for White). 

I looked at L17, but with my top open at the top left I figured K4 would be bigger.

AB: The lower side is certainly more important than L17 but...];B[jp]LB
[dg:A][gq:B][hq:C]C[... I think the most important point was D13. Just imagine a white stone there, the difference is beyond words. On the lower side you follow the traditional Chinese fuseki, but under the given circumstances I would prefer B (G3) over L4. This hits the weak point of the White shimari. Furthermore, after L4 White has the excellent follow-up C (H3) which protects the weak point, makes territory and aims at invading the Black framework.]
;W[dg]C[AB: This is an excellent move, the most important point on the board.]
;B[eg];W[eh];B[dh]C[AB: Good.];W[cg];B[fh]LB[ef:A][fg:B]C[AB: *Very bad!!!* Consider a White answer at A (E14). This captures either the E13 stone or the D14-16 group. B (F13) is the only move here, 
this also threatens to capture the E12 stone in a ladder starting with E11.]
;W[ei]C[AB: That was good luck!];B[fg]C[AB: There is one more reason why move 27 (F12) was so bad. There is a technique called tewari analysis by which it becomes clear. The technique is to change the move order that led to the current position in order to find bad moves. Assume you had played F13 first (the correct move), then White plays E11 (a reasonable but risky play, correct would be D11, which eliminates the aji of the D12 stone). Would you now play F12?? You certainly wouldn't (F18 or H13 look much more interesting), but that's exactly the situation you have now.]
;W[nc]C[This time I was prepared to pincer white, let him have the corner and build two large moyos, Upper and Right side.

AB: You probably won't get two moyos. The right side is more important than the upper side.]
;B[lc]LB[pf:A]C[AB: That's why an ordinary move like A (Q14) would be perfect. You can't expect to get to much territory on the upper side because it is open on the edge. Rather, you should initiate a fight there because your position is very strong.]
;W[ne]C[He didn't fall for it.  The standard move I realize is B-Q14, but then he could go M15 or K17. 

AB: You should never hope for bad plays of your opponent :-) It's good that you realize that Q14 is the standard move now. In this position it is just perfect!! You start to build some territory on the right and White gets a rather weak group in your moyo. White M15 is good but K16 would also be a good answer. That would leave the White group eyeless and threat to make territory be closing the edge with F18. White K17 is an overplay, you simply escape with the M17 stone and cut White into pieces which is just what you want. Another idea for White is L16 (see variation after next move).]

(;B[le]C[AB: Q14 is definetely better, because you now too much rely on your top which is not so big at all. Also, once your opponent realizes that you depend too much on this one territory he gets a lot of sente moves against it and you lose the initiative completely. You should thus try to play a more flexible game.]
;W[pf]C[AB: This is really good for White. Your corner stone may live, but White gets also a living group very easily (too easily, because he invaded your sphere of influence).]
;B[qf];W[pe];B[pc]C[I was planning to link up the corner to the M group next. 

AB: Oops. The connection of R15 is the only move here. Once White plays there he hold the initiative and the right side (which is a very interesting area and an area where you had the better position initially.]
;W[qe];B[nb];W[mc];B[mb];W[oc];B[ob];W[od]C[AB: I don't know whether this move is good or should be left unplayed.]
;B[qd]C[AB: This is bad shape. If you want to play there it is best to play R18 immediately. Other than that I'm not sure whether it's best to play on the lower side (G3) (good move without taking any risks) or invade the left side (C8? maybe) (risky but effective).]
;W[rd];B[qb];W[kd]C[He still was able to invade my upper moyo and destroy potenial territory anyway.

AB: Yes, that is no problem now for him. This is because he already has a save group on the right and also because the edge of your moyo is open.]
;B[ld];W[jf];B[jh]C[I used this to pressure W and build a wall facing south.]
;W[kg];B[kh];W[lg];B[mf]C[I wasn't sure about this move, but later on it is what saved the game for me. 

AB: This move is very good because keeping the white groups seperated is the only chance for you to make use of your strength.]
;W[lh];B[li];W[nh];B[jg];W[ke];B[mi]C[AB: This is not so good, because White can now connect his groups. On the other hand, both groups are already pretty save so maybe your chances of killing one group are minimal anyway.]
;W[ng]C[I had sente now and I felt I could reduce W's influence on the Left side.  At the same time I wanted to continue to build my center, lower Right moyo.]
;B[en]MA[dh]C[AB: So you have to decide now whether to play on the lower or on the left side. Since the game is now good for White it might be appropriate to take more risks and choose the left side. However, 63 seems to be very bad. You give White a lot of territory and you lose the aji of the marked stone (D12). This stone can be very effective when invading the side. It cannot be saved now but can well support the invasion because it is an important stone (a cutting stone).]
;W[dn];B[em];W[dm];B[el];W[dl];B[fi];W[ej];B[fk]C[AB: Take a look at the board now. White has 65 points on the left and they are sure. Furthermore he has 5 points komi and maybe something like 10 points on the right. Black has 6 points in the upper right and some influence in the center which is at the current time no more than 15  secure points. In the lower right Black has an advantage so he might get maybe 20 points more than White will get there. All in all, the game is over.]
;W[he]LB[hq:A]C[AB: This point is not important at all. A move at A (H3) will make the White victory even more obvious.]
;B[hg]LB[fe:A]C[AB: If you answer the move 72 (you can also consider ignoring it) you should make proper shape at A (F15).]
;W[fe];B[ee];W[fd];B[ed]C[THis made my stones heavy, but really didn't do much harm, I thought.

AB: No, the shape you get is terrible. You have far too much stones there for almost no purpose. You should try to use every single stone effectively and your stones are very inefficient here. Maybe you should consider sacrificing E-F17 stones, although I'm not sure.]
;W[ff];B[ef];W[po]LB[np:A][oo:B]C[This time I thought that a capping play would be best , as I didn't want W to invade into the center, or lower side.

AB: The white move is quite good though I would still prefer H3. I think the joseki starting with A (O4) or maybe B (P5) would be ok, since they lead to a balanced position with the K4 stone.]
;B[no];W[qq]LB[op:A]C[AB: The problem with the capping play is the point A (P4). I think White should play there immediately, because this will isolate the corner and make an invasion between K4 and O5 quite effective.]
;B[op]C[AB: It's good that you protect the weak point but handing the corner to White so easy is unpleasent. That's why I think you initial capping was not such a good idea (although, generally, I would encourage you to make up your own mind).]
;W[qp]C[AB: A very save move. I think R2 would also be possible.];B[om]
C[I was prepared for white to live in the corner, but wasn't prepared for what follows. 

AB: This move looks very interesting. Now you middle moyo starts to look like something. Maybe White should now do something about it, e. g. with G4.]
;W[hp]C[This really hurt my center territory. I figured I could just Cap passively at H6 or H5 , but I wanted to gain sente so I played F4 instead.

AB: This is a most excellent move from White. If you try to defend the middle you will end up with a big loss because all moves in that area by White will be sente.]
;B[fp]C[AB: I don't know if it is possible to cut the White stones at all. If I were in your shoes I wouldn't know where to play either. I guess I would resign.]
;W[fq];B[fo];W[gp]LB[eq:A]C[AB: This is not so good shape. It's better to play at A (E3). Then there will be no corner aji.]
;B[eq]C[I was looking to cut off the invading stones with this sacrifice. 

AB: This was possible due to the previous mistake by White. Now a difficult fight starts which can only be good for you.]
;W[dq];B[gq];W[er];B[gr];W[iq];B[ir];W[jr];B[hq];W[is]C[Now I was in trouble. The only way out I saw was with a ko.  But I calculated I had more threats than white anyway.]

(;B[hs]C[AB: A save way of playing is to cut at B (J4). But you might end up with to few points.]
;W[hr];B[dk]LB[fj:A]C[AB: A threat at A (F10) seems better to me because your moyo gets mote stable this way.]
;W[ek];B[ir];W[kb];B[lb];W[hr];B[dj];W[di];B[ir];W[oj]C[When W played here I took the ko. 

AB: White has no really good threats.];B[js];W[ok];B[mk]C[AB: This is a difficult decision. Of course, you want to defend your moyo, but a white move at Q8 now would make 20-25 points on the right for White.]
;W[nl];B[ol]C[AB: I'm not sure about this one.];W[nm]LB[nk:A]C[AB: Very risky. Connecting at A (O9) will be good enough for White.]
;B[nk]LB[on:A]C[AB: Again very risky. You are behind in the game so taking risks might be appropriate. In an even game, however, I'd prefer A (P6). This establishes some black stones on the right hand side, so White won't get too many points there and also threats the corner group making miai between the cut you played and a corner attack (Q2 probably).]
;W[on];B[nn];W[mm];B[pn]LB[pj:A]C[I rushed things here and played impulsively which got me into a heap of trouble.

AB: Your play here seems ok to me, although I'm not a fighting expert. Maybe you should first play A (Q10) which is sente and makes your group relatively stable. It's not easy for White as well to escape with his three important cutting stones.]
;W[oo];B[qo];W[pp];B[nq];W[qn];B[qm];W[pm];B[pl];W[rm];B[pn];W[rn];B[rl]
C[AB: Now is the time for Q10.];W[rk];B[pj];W[oi];B[qh];W[pi]LB[qi:A]C[AB: This is bad (aji keshi). White should leave the situation, because he might later rather play at A.]
;B[qi];W[sl];B[rj]C[I knew my group was short of eye space, but I also new that white's O7 group was cut off too. 

AB: Yes. It's very complicated. You cannot make two eyes on the right.]
;W[ql];B[qk]LB[qj:A]C[AB: This is no good because A (R10) will not become an eye.]
;W[rl]LB[pm:A]C[AB: White should of course capture at A (Q7). This is also atari.]
;B[rf];W[re];B[pg]C[I was aiming at O14 next to cut off W's group.]
(;W[rg]LB[nf:A]C[AB: It's not so easy for White now, either. Simply connecting his groups with A (O14) will probably let you live. Maybe he should play like in the variation.]
;B[sg];W[rh];B[ri];W[eo]C[AB: This is off-topic. White must protect the cut under all circumstances.]
;B[gn];W[ln];B[fj];W[ci];B[nf]C[Now I played this and thought I could win the capture race.]
;W[of];B[og];W[pm];B[qj];W[sh];B[si];W[sf];B[qg];W[se];B[sg];W[rh];B[rc]
;W[ph];B[sc];W[rg]C[AB: This move is bad. It does not gain a liberty. But you would win the capturing race anyway.]
;B[sd];W[oe];B[md];W[kc]C[Now I figured I had the game won if I didn't screw up.  So I played conservatively here.]
;B[nd]C[AB: This move was not necessary, but of course the game is now won for you. White has let you make the game complicated when it was actually very simple for him to win. It started with the bad corner aji in the lower left. From there on White got overly nervous about your moyo and ran into trouble.]
;W[hc];B[fb];W[mp];B[np];W[mq];B[mn];W[pr];B[or];W[oq];B[mr];W[mo];B[nr]
;W[ks]C[I knew M7 would save me, though M3 would be good too.];B[jq];W[is]
;B[ip];W[lr];B[lm];W[kq];B[kp];W[ms];B[ml]LB[os:A]C[AB: A move at A (P1) is ok here.]
;W[hb];B[lo]C[I guess I didn't really need M5.];W[kn];B[lq]C[AB: This is also not necessary. You capture the bottom group anyway.]
;W[gc];B[ps];W[qs];B[os];W[if];B[ig];W[gf];B[gg];W[nj];B[mj];W[lf]C[I should have next played O11.  This would have netted me another large group, but I didn't see it  at the time.

AB: Yes, that's true.];B[me]C[I was nervous about missing something so I took the safe way out instead, esecially as I figured I was ahead by about 30 points.]
;W[mh];B[ni];W[oh];B[mg]C[I know. I This uses up ko threats,  I probably should have played elsewhere.  But I didn't see any ko potential anyway.

AB: Correct. You should leave the moves. But the game is now decided and 
White should have resigned after he lost the capturing race.];W[kf];B[ia]
C[I saw this tesuji a few moves back.];W[ka];B[ha];W[ib];B[gb]LB[ga:A]C
[AB: One detail here. It's better to play A (G19). So K19 will not be sente.]
;W[ja];B[ga];W[fr];B[pq];W[go]LB[qr:A]C[AB: White should connect at A (R2). This is a one sided risk.]
;B[ho];W[oq];B[hf];W[pq];B[ie]C[AB: Now you could use your ko threats :-)]
;W[hd];B[fs];W[es];B[gs];W[sk];B[la];W[ea];B[sj];W[tt]C[Game over.  I won with a comfortable margin.  But only because I was able to save my Right side group and capture his.  I missed a big capture at O11, but wasn't critical for the win.

AB: Yes, the right side was crucial. You first gave it to him and then he gave it back to you. All in all, your game is very moyo biased (mine is too, by the way, somehow all amateurs like Takemiya style). This should not let you ignore territory at all. Giving the complete left side to White was bad, because your moyo was still open. Once an opponent reognizes this dependence it is easy for him to reduce in sente.
