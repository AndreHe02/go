C[buckyyowza: Reviewed by Mark Fyffe.  I hope you enjoy my comments and find them of use.  I am focusing primarily on black's game, but will highlight places where both players could have made better choices.]

(;B[cn]LB[fd:A]C[buckyyowza: Black should finish the joseki with F16 - tenuki now leaves a serious weakness in the upper left corner.  There are times where kikashi play (forcing moves where the completion is saved for later) is a good choice, but early corner joseki is not one of these times.  Play like this will ultimately leave you spread thin without a strong base to fight from.]
;W[fp];B[ci];W[cf]LB[fd:A][df:B]SQ[ed][ci]C[buckyyowza: Considering the strong cutting point at F16 and the shape of the marked stones, I would prefer a white stone at D14.  This move by white politely forgives black for the unfinished corner play, allowing black to build thickness around his weak groups and control the center game.  D14 separates black's left groups with no real cost to white.]
;B[hq]SQ[fc][ed]C[Park0 [5k\]: hmm

buckyyowza: A double-approach is not typically a bad plan, and this is no exception considered locally.  This move is often seen played by white in handicap games, primarily because it is very aggressive.  Be sure to keep the whole board in mind when selecting plays, however.  On the left side, and especially with the marked stones, black is very thin.  White's position in the upper left OTOH is very strong and one stone away from a solid extension into the center.  If white chooses to run toward these stones, black is already fighting on too many fronts against a stronger position.]
;W[kp]LB[dk:B][ho:A]C[buckyyowza: A gift for black?  This pincer simply does not work for white - black's next move cuts this stone off from white's base while attacking the base and building a nice big moyo.  Could this possibly be what white wants?  Better ideas would be to cap H3 by playing H5, or to play a cutting play around D9.]

;B[gp]LB[fd:B][pj:C][dn:A]C[buckyyowza: Black makes several plays during this sequence that force white to solidify while compromising the corner group, this being the first.  After H2, it is best to tenuki and focus on large areas of the board.  The best move for black locally here is D6, but considering that white has traded the corner for influence and black has unfinished business in the upper right, continuing local play here is not the best plan.  I'd prefer a play around F16 or Q10 here.]

LB[jd:B][pj:A]C[buckyyowza: considering black's dragon around H5 and white's growing influence in the center, 4th line plays like Q10 and K16 would be better to build thickness.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[ic]LB[jd:A]C[buckyyowza: again, a better strategy for black would be to build thickness in the center.  Playing an upper shoulder hit at K16 serves the same purpose of supporting F17 while limiting white's influence.]

(;B[qp]LB[pq:A]C[buckyyowza: this sequence is very good for white, leaving 20-30 points of solid territory on the lower side.  Consider the variation starting with Q3 instead.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[oq];B[np];W[mp];B[mq];W[lp];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp]
;W[sr];B[lc]LB[hl:A]TR[gm][hm][eo][fo][ho][gp][hp][hq]C[buckyyowza: it is time to worry about the marked group.  H8 is a important point for both players here.  This sequence starting with M17 only helps white solidify the upper side without a clear benefit for black.]
;W[lb];B[mc];W[mb];B[kd]
(;W[jb]C[buckyyowza: white can play O16 here instead to erase black's moyo there.  The upper side group will be fine considering the L17 stone - this stone can be a sacrifice or become part of white's second eye.]
;B[jc];W[kb]
(;B[le]LB[nd:A]C[buckyyowza: black can prevent a cut with O16 instead]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[qb];B[kj];W[jk]LB[hl:A]TR[gm][hm][eo][fo][ho]
[gp][hp][hq]C[buckyyowza: now we can see why H8 was needed for black some time ago.  The center and right side mojo will not be enough if black loses the H7 group.]
;B[jj]LB[km:A]C[buckyyowza: It is probably better to try to escape the H7 stones than to seal them in.  L7 looks like a good play to either connect these stones out, build eye space, or at least reduce white's territory here.]
;W[ik];B[hl];W[hk];B[gk];W[fl]C[buckyyowza: black is attacking a very strong group with a very weak one.  This cannot end well.]
(;B[fn]LB[km:A]C[buckyyowza: This will one get one eye.  Even after sealing the upper escape route, L7 is still black's best bet to make the most of this situation.  White will focus more on preventing escape than on taking away this eye.]

(;W[ok]LB[mk:A][qk:C][nl:B]C[buckyyowza: This play by white is ineffective.  It is too deep for a reduction, and not deep enough to become part of an invasion.  I'd prefer to see N9 or O8 here, then follow up with R9 if black doesn't respond correctly.]

C[buckyyowza:  Not a bad result considering a much stronger opening by white, and several strategic flaws in black's play.  While white's strategy was more sound, and he took advantage of black's early mistakes, it would appear the black's grasp on whole board thinking in the middle game brought the game closer to even.

Especially considering that by rank black should have taken 2 stones and had fallen behind early on, I thought during the center fighting that white may have become lazy and could have tried harder.  It is never a good plan to underestimate your opponent, even when facing certain victory ;-)  In the end, this game was much closer than it should have been.

Thank you for the opportunity to review this game - I always enjoy an opportunity to look through an exciting game :-)  I hope you have enjoyed my review.
