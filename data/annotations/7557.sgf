C[Hi, I'm black and I really didn't have a clue where or what in this game. I constantly felt like I'm running after white. Please advice, especially the opening in the upper left corner didn't work well but I'm sure that there were more things that can be improved.

Many thanks,
Lothar.

Hi Lothar :)

This looks like a complicated game. On the first look its apparent that you often play moves that are very slow instead of simply playing the proper shape.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[de];W[gd];B[cc];W[ec]C[I don't think this move exists.]
(;B[cd]C[This looks ok too];W[cj]LB[ch:A][cl:B]C[A is very safe and recomendable. In case you want to attack, which I cannot really refuse, you must play B.]
(;B[cm]C[C12 probably better. Thought that WC6 would be to good to allow.]
;W[cf]C[This is a bad move. White has to play one spot lower.]
(;B[cb]C[Too slow ? D14 ? C12?

Since you really aren't alive it's not slow but bad.];W[eg]
C[A bit risky, leaves a weakness at D12];B[fe];W[ge]C[A very bad move since you don't want to play at G15, which would only help white.]
;B[ff];W[jp]C[Both white groups on top left are weak, no time for this.]
;B[ic]C[Too close to W ? Better to play someting differnt like R6?

No, it's a very good attack. Now the plan would be to take whites base and let him move towards the middle while stabilizing the top group in sente and then strike at d12 to make a splitting attack.]
;W[jd]
(;B[jc];W[kd];B[fd];W[fc]
(;B[gc]C[This plan is not neccessarily bad, but when a plan contains sacrifice of stones, its better to play in such a way that you actually avoid it. (To quote Catalin - "When you want to play 1-2-3, play 3.")]
;W[hc];B[gb];W[hb];B[hd];W[fb];B[id];W[hf]C[Think now that there was plenty of room to work with J17 group. I was worried about the upper corner group which was not alive

The top left cannot be killed now. But sacrificing the top stones means loosing the game.]
(;B[fg];W[kc]
(;B[ei]C[C12 the real thing ?

Small note - locally E12 is better, it makes the black group MUCH stronger.]
;W[ch]C[D12 is better, but its not a big deal.];B[df]C[doesn't do much... the idea was D13 but it's much too small. D9 instead ?

Since you are strong now, you should go for the eyes, that is B11. True, this move does nothing.]
;W[hh]
(;B[qn]C[Q16 is very week, not to die ofc, but white can make a lot attacking the stone.]
;W[ej]C[Looks like noone knows what he wants :)];B[ce]C[And what the hell is this? Don't play empty triangle applies here in full extent. This are is only a small endgame. And if you, in the right time, want to play here, B14 is the spot.]
;W[bf];B[dg]C[Now white made the points.];W[nc]C[Mistake. Overconcentrated and ineffective. Should absolutely be from the other side so that black cannot be even sure of living. Now, in this kind of situation, its good to show the opponent how overconcentrated he is...]
(;B[oc];W[nd];B[qf]C[This is also a good direction. Just the attachement overconcentrates him even more.]
;W[do]C[No reason to play this, it helps you a lot.];B[co];W[ep]
(;B[cp]C[Very slow.];W[eq]C[Now the corner looks bad.];B[np]
C[This looks fine];W[pn];B[pm];W[on]
(;B[qm]C[No way!];W[pe]C[White just loves to make you stronger]
(;B[qd]C[Uhoh, whats this?];W[qe];B[re];W[pf];B[qg];W[pg];B[pi]
C[If you are not afraid of the R12 cut, just hane at Q12, otherwise extend. But this leaves more aji.]
;W[pk]C[White wants to make a moyo, but again, this helps you more.]
(;B[ph]C[No reason not to play the obvious move];W[od]
(;B[pc];W[om];B[rp]C[I guess you don't want to leave O4 to drawn. By this you take away many of its ways to live.]
;W[qq];B[og];W[rk]C[White should have played this earlier, but it still hurts a lot. Black cannot win this game.]
;B[rq];W[nf];B[qj];W[qk];B[rl];W[ri];B[rh];W[mi]C[I don't get this move. It doesn't cloes either side.]
;B[ng];W[mg]
(;B[of]C[dumb..];W[oe];B[mh];W[nh]
(;B[lo]C[M4 ? I would play neither. Even if this group survives it leaves white with huge bottom side. You need to make things messy to have a chance.
This move is very bad because it doesn't improve your shape in any way.]
;W[lq]C[right move];B[jo]C[good];W[ip];B[lp]C[doesn't help you.]
;W[mq];B[nn]C[You need to make eyes, not to save one stone. You seriously risk dying.]
(;W[ol]C[very slow.];B[io];W[oh]C[Also slow, gives you time to catch up with the middle group. On the other hand, white knows he will win so he can play this.]
;B[hp];W[hq];B[kp];W[kq];B[gq];W[gp];B[ho];W[iq];B[go];W[fp]
;B[jj]C[From now on I will only react to your questions and maybe few things, not to strategy, because the game is too unballanced.]
;W[jh];B[ml];W[nq];B[gk];W[kk];B[ki]C[This doesn't have any continuation and it's risky.]
