C[This game review is part of the Go Teaching Ladder and was reviewed by Vince Suttle (vin 8k* on IGS).   The comments were added using the WinMGT shareware program which is readily available at Go ftp sites.]
;B[qp];W[op];B[pq]LB[oq:a][mq:b][mp:c][lq:d][lp:e][oo:f][pn:g]
[qn:h]C[This is an unusual move which seems too pre-occupied with defending the corner. The normal repliy is one of the pointsshown as a-h .]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jp]LB[mp:a][lp:b]C[This is not a bad move, but I would have put more pressure on the white stone by playing at either the points marked "a" or "b". This would have given white less room to make eye shape for his stone.]
;W[oq];B[dj]C[Again this is a good solid extentsion from the corner stone making a double-wing formation which is good.]
;W[pj];B[qn]LB[mq:a][on:b]C[This move extends blacks corner but allows white to extend from histwo stones at the bottom. Black "a", white "b", followed by the move actually played would have been better.]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr];W[ql]LB[jd:a]C[Whites move here is too small a move at this stage of the game. There are other points that are worth far more. One example is "a".]
;B[df];W[ce];B[cf];W[fd];B[nd];W[oc]LB[pf:a][ld:b][lc:c][kd:d]
[kc:e]C[Both sides seem to like this move in response to an approach to a star point stone. This move is just an attempt to defend the corner area. It does not work very well with whites other stones. Also it is still possible to invade the corner at the 3-3 point.

I would prefer an extension to "a" or a pincer attack  at b,c,d or e. Any of these moves would work with  whites existing stones. For example a pincer at "d" is also an extension from the stone at F16.]
;B[nc];W[pf];B[jd]C[This is a much better move than playing one line higher at R17, which would leave the black stones a bit low.]
;W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[ep]LB[fp:a][cl:b]C[This was not a good move. It is too tight. A move at "a" or "b" would have been better. I would have played at "a".]
;W[gq]C[This is an unreasonable move by white. He already has two weak stones in this area of the board. This is a good chance for black to go on the attack.]
;B[gp]C[This nove not only attacks the white stone, it also indirectly threatens the two white stones on the left.]
;W[hp];B[go];W[ho];B[hq]C[White is in big trouble at this point.]
;W[fq];B[er];W[iq];B[hr];W[ip]C[White should be getting his stones out into the open space in the centre.]
;B[ir];W[gn]C[Notice how the4  white stones have few liberties left now. Black should take advantage of this.]

(;B[fp]LB[hn:a]C[No this was not a good move. Black should cut at "a" which would keep the white stones seperated. See the variation given for the previous move.]
;W[in]C[This move helps white enormously. Compare this position to the variation given 2 moves ago. White was very lucky to be allowed to make this move.]
;B[en];W[em];B[dl];W[cl];B[dm]LB[ck:a][fn:b][fm:c][gm:d]C[I would have played at "a" here. If white next plays at the spot where black actually played then black "b", white "c", black "d" keeps white split up and still in trouble.]
;W[cm];B[ck];W[bo];B[bp];W[eo];B[fn];W[do];B[cp];W[fo];B[fm]
;W[el];B[dk];W[fl];B[gm];W[hn];B[gl];W[fk];B[gk];W[fj];B[gj]
;W[fi]LB[bl:a]C[Black could capture the white stones on the left by playing at "a". He could also attack the white stones at the bottom.]
;B[gi];W[gh];B[fh];W[eh];B[fg];W[di]C[Black needs to be careful now, his own stones on the left are starting to look weak.]
;B[ci];W[ch];B[ei]LB[bl:a]C[By playing here black just uses up two very vital liberties of his own.

Black could have played at "a" to kill the white stones on the left.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[ei];B[eg];W[dh];B[bi];W[bh];B[bl]LB[bk:a][bf:b]
[hh:c]C[As the continuation shows, this fails completely. If black "a", then white "b" saves his group. Black c then captures the cutting stone in a ladder.]
;W[bk]C[Now its too late to save the black stones.];B[cj];W[bj]
;B[ai];W[ah];B[bn];W[aj];B[hh];W[ld];B[lc];W[kd];B[je]LB[kc:a]
[lf:b][nf:c]C[No, black must play at "a" to keep his stones connected. Whites two stones would still be vulnerable. But the main thing is for black to obtain a secure base for his stones. He can then safely attack white.]
;W[kc];B[lb]C[No, if black is going to try and save these stones then he needs to move out into the centre at "a" or "b".]
;W[jc]C[See the variation for an alternative to blacks next move if he wants to attack the stones at the bottom.]

(;B[jn]LB[kn:a][lo:b][kp:c]C[This is probably too close to the white stones. In general contact moves are not the best attacking moves.  "a" , "b" or "c" would have been better. "b"  and "c" also threatens the group below.]
;W[il];B[jl]LB[jo:a][ko:b][jm:c]C[Playing like this leaves weak spots where white can push through and cut. For example white "a", black "b", white "c". Also you are driving white towards your own weakish stones.]
;W[ik];B[jk];W[ij];B[jj];W[ii];B[ji]LB[jg:a][ih:b][ig:c][jm:d]
[jo:e]C[Black "a" would have been a much better move. If white "b" black "c". If white "c" then black "b". But black still has the weak points at "d" and "e".]
;W[ih];B[jg]C[This move lets white through and the black stones on the left are beginning to look weak.]
;W[ig]C[Black has really missed his chance now.];B[if];W[hg]
;B[gg];W[hf];B[gf]LB[he:a][hc:b][nf:c]C[Black "a", aiming to follow up with "b" and "c" would have been better.]
;W[he];B[ge];W[gd];B[hd];W[id];B[hc];W[ic]C[Black had plenty of chances in this game. White played quite a few aggressive and risky moves that really desrved to have been punished.   I think that you would benefit from reading a good book on tesuji (local tactics) and also one on Life and Death (how to kill or save stones).

I hope that this review will be useful to you. If you would like to discuss anything about the game or my comments please email me. Also if you would like me to review any more of your games, just send them too me.]

(;B[kp]C[By turning here black threatens the two stones at the bottom. If next ...]
;W[lp];B[km]C[A black play here cuts off whites escape to the right. One possible continuation is ...]
;W[il];B[jk];W[ik];B[jj];W[ij];B[ji];W[ii];B[ih]C[And white cannot escape. Note that in this position the weak black stones at the top, now have some supporting stones to run towards.]
))
(;B[hn];W[io];B[hm]LB[jn:a][fn:b]C[This threatens to play at "a" which would capture 5 white stones, or "b" which would catch the white stone in a ladder. Either way things look bad for white.]
;W[fn];B[fp];W[jo];B[kp]C[And whites stones are under severe attack all round.]
