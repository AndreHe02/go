C[Hi!
Glad to have my game reviewed by you.
Although i won ,i think it is not completely my winning
game.
Hope you can give me some good suggestions.

--> will try.  ;-)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[ce]C[I believe the approaching move should be close to cornor...


--> This move or f3 are the two approach moves.  r5 also possible.]
;W[fd];B[ch]C[--> This is a safe joseki.   But in this case, I think it is too conservative and small.  Since the game is still wide open, and there's no particular danger on the left side, you might try c11 or c17.  There are too many variations for me to show them, but you should learn at least how to follow up the attachment at c17.  The reason I don't like c12 here is because w gets the lovely sente move of c16, taking territory, solidifying himself, and overconcentrating you all in one, in an area where you were never in danger.  

Peronally, I would treat c15 lightly and play h17 because it works well with the Q16 stone and gets at the weak underside of the two white stones.  That's a joseki too.]
;W[cd];B[bd]C[--> Just standing at d15 is probably better, although of course it is regrettable to be forced.  Still, early in the game, you want to concentrate on getting out in the center more than just making a small base that completely solidifies white in the process.  You don't need to play this defensively.]
;W[bc];B[dd];W[cc];B[be];W[po];B[ql];W[qj]C[--> W is trying things.  Lots of possiblities here.]
;B[ol]C[--> Good calm move.];W[qg];B[oo]C[force for the response]
;W[qq]C[-->This doesn't work for white.];B[pp];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro]
;B[qn];W[qr];B[pr];W[rn];B[rm]C[Is the move okay??

-->yes, it's a very good move.  B is doing very well in this corner.]
;W[rr]C[--> Not good shape for w.  if he wants to play it should be at T4 or t2.  This can lead to complications.  B can kill if w makes a mistake, or else just reduces his number of points by quite a bit.]

(;B[pn]C[--> This is a good, solid move.  However, you could also choose to put pressure on white with r15, while helping secure the corner.  If w decides to run with q5, you can give him a few points in exchange for major thickness that will further threaten the two white stones.]
;W[cj]C[--> W is greedy.  You should attack the two weak stones on the upper right side, since your group is very well settled on the left anyway.  

You could build territory while attacking with r15, or build influence with a move like q12...]
;B[cn]LB[fq:A][jd:B]C[It the approach right?
maybe A or elsewhere

-->  Well, you both seem to like complicating things.  In this case, though, I think this is not a good move.  W just plays f3, reducing the effectivness of your beautiful wall, and then has c10 is in a great position to keep your groups apart.  You should STILL first attack the two stones in the upper right.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[fq];B[ep]C[-->This is a very bad move.  Just shoulder hit at d9, making good shape and attackig the lone white stone at the same time.  Then later you can h3, aiming  at c3 and getting lots of territory in the process.  This move here just solidifies w, takes away aji, and doesn't help you at all.]
;W[eq];B[eo]C[--> This is a terrible move.  Remember never to play like this again!  Why are you connecting a single stone that is plastered against a strong white wall?  You are just making yourself heavy.  Don't just continue in an area because you started there.  you should concentrate instead on getting out into the center and putting pressure on the lone white stone.]
;W[dl];B[ho]C[I don't know what the move means myself .I used to see the pros  play that way.

-> Don't play moves you don't understand!  Although it is good for you to have instincts about the basics of shape (out of context, this is a good extension from your e-line stones when they are close to white strength), you need to understand the moves you are plaing.  Right now, you might be better off capping white at f8.  That move helps your group and hurts white at the same time.]
;W[hq];B[iq]C[--> No, no, no!  Wrong side.  Don't think about territory so much.  First exploit w's weakness.  If you lean on w with a move like e11, you can make him run into the center.  As he runs into the center, you can give chase on the j line, strenghtening your heavy four stones and making your potential for territory on the bottom side even greater.  W should end in gote, then you can play a move like j4 or j3, depending on how the chase goes.]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[go];B[el];W[ek];B[dk]C[--> This is a complicated way to play --  but after your last four moves, it might be the best option.]
;W[dj]C[-->  Now b has many good options.];B[ck];W[cl];B[bk]
;W[bl];B[ej];W[fk];B[bj];W[ei]C[--> Terrible move for white.  Just helps b get more points.  Should really atari at e7 now to play the "honest move."  But if he insists on playing in the center, he should atari at f10, not e11, to make more trouble for the e8 stone.]

(;B[fj]C[--> To be consistent with e11, b should trap the running b stones in a ladder at g10 next, otherwise e11 was a useless sacrifice.]
;W[em];B[fl];W[fm];B[gk]C[--> b should be happy, this thickness works beautifully with his influential wall in the lower right, despite hurting his line e group terribly.]
;W[dm]TR[cn][dn][eo][ep]C[The marked ones should be dead.
sobbing....];B[fh]C[--> VERY bad.  Not nearly the biggest point on the board -- but more importantly, this is in the totally wrong area of play.  Right now, there are STILL TWO WEAK WHITE STONES ON THE BOARD!  You really should be pressing your advantage and attacking white while strengthening your line b corner stone.  Look how close this move is to your own totally thick completely 100% rock solid territory.  There is a general rule in go -- "never play near thickness."  Not your own, and not your opponent's.  Trapping these few white stones is NOT important, since you are alive, out, and thick no matter what.  You should welcome it if w tries to run any time soon, since you'll have a weak group to threaten.]
;W[hn]C[--> Big.  takes away aji and keeps himself from being totally sealed in.]
;B[io];W[nc]C[The big big problem comes! I think B is the usual move but seems to not fit to the situation.

--> Now b looks outnumbered up there, when he could have had a total advantage.  Of course, b is so far ahead anyway it isn't that big of a problem....]
;B[kd]C[--> There aren't many conventional moves for b that would end up terribly.]
;W[ne]
(;B[pg]C[--> This attachment is bad.  B is winning - why let w complicate things?]
;W[qf];B[qh]
(;W[rh]C[-->too passive.];B[pf];W[qe];B[pe];W[pb]C[--> w is busy.]
;B[qd];W[ph]
(;B[ri]C[--> This move accomplishes nothing but helping white.  See variation for a better idea.]
;W[qi];B[oh];W[oi];B[nh];W[kb];B[nd]C[--> Not a good move.  If w responds well, he only strengthens himself and you don't get anything in return.  Worse, your l16 stone would become weakened.  Lucky for you, w played badly....]
;W[md];B[od];W[oc]C[-->  Very very bad.  W should get into the center with a move like m15, or at the very least connect with n17 so you can't cut him off.]
;B[me]C[white do the bad job

--> yes.];W[le];B[mf];W[ld];B[ni];W[oj];B[nj];W[jm];B[in];W[hm]
C[-->bad. W should instead run to k10 and try to get to the top.  But really this is pretty hopeless for w at this point.]
;B[im];W[jk];B[il];W[ll];B[jl];W[lj];B[kk];W[lk];B[kl];W[nk]
;B[ok];W[mk]C[--> Terrible, awful shape.  W is taking away his own eye space.  He should run, run, run toward the top.]
;B[lh]C[Now w has no chance at all.];W[ln];B[km];W[mo];B[lm]

;W[op];B[oq]C[white resigh

--> And he should have resigned a long time ago!  

Overall, you need to think about what areas are the most urgent before you make moves.  f12 was a good move ocally, but it gave white a chance to come back by leaning on your lonelly corner stone.  Instead, you could have been strengthening your corner and taking territory on the top while CHASING white if you played there.  Use your influence while you can to keep on the attack.]
