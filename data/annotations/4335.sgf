C[In this game both players show a good feeling for positional judgement and also good fighting spirit.

I added some comments and variations, that seem natural to me, but please keep in mind, that my suggested moves don't need to be better than yours.

best regards,

(;W[hd]C[prana: overplay.]
(;B[ff]C[prana: the wrong cut. 
This gives you a heavy group. 
It helps w to settle his stones.];W[fg];B[gf];W[he]TR[ff][gf]
C[prana: these stones are a burdon for b. w is happy to connect his cut at H15 in sente]

(;B[eg]C[prana: this move would be fine, if it were sente (atari). But because of c14/d14 it isn't. 
B is still heavy.];W[lc]
(;B[bp]LB[cg:D][dh:A][eh:C][ci:E][bp:A]C[Ilya: Should I play A first and cut at E after exchanging white B, black C, white D?

prana: After b A, w B, b C white can connect at E. 
So, this is not what b is looking for...
But I agree, b B4 is too slow, the corner is not very interesting.]
;W[cm]LB[dh:A]TR[bp]C[Ilya: Not sure what is the best reply here. The white's move seems to cover weak point at A indirectly.

prana: yes, it is a good move];B[bm];W[cl];B[bl]

(;B[bb]LB[fj:A]C[Ilya: Mistake - should be at A as I understand.
prana: yes. B18 might be the losing move.];W[fi];B[cq];W[dq]
;B[if]LB[le:A][og:B][gi:D][jp:C]C[prana: wrong direction. If you play more loosely, you can  avoid heavyness.
E.g. A-D as alternatives];W[eh];B[jg];W[ih];B[hf];W[je];B[lg]
;W[ki]C[Ilya: Painful attack - white builds huge moyo in the center.
prana: the attack is possible, because of your heavy center group.]
;B[md];W[nb];B[kd];W[kc];B[jd];W[jc];B[ip]LB[jp:A]C[Ilya: I'm trying to reduce the moyo.
prana: yes, that's fine, but A might be safer.];W[mq]TR[ip]
C[Ilya: I'm not sure what is the best way to handle this tsuke? Was the marked stone played too deep in the first place?
prana: yes, it was risky.];B[mp];W[lq];B[lp];W[nr];B[or]LB[oq:A]
C[Ilya: Should it be at A?
prana: difficult. It looks like bad shape, because of the atari at o4. On the other hand, w is short in liberties, so it's good to fight closely.
I think it's ok.];W[np];B[oq];W[kp];B[kq];W[lo];B[mo];W[mn]

;B[kq];W[qc];B[kp]TR[jq][lq][mq][kr][nr]C[Ilya: I decided to tenuki and close the ko expecting to kill the marked stones and hoping it'll compensate the loss of the upper right corner.
