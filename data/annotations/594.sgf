GC[Dear Herve,

both of you made some major mistakes in the lower left corner - you should have been able to get a large proft there.

The main reason you lost is due to the way you tried to live with your weak group on the lower side - especially your attachment at R6.

Enjoy the review
Christian Gawron]

There are only two moves to think about: Escaping with G4 or forcing with E2 before escaping (of course you have to read out the semeai first ...).]

;B[rc]C[Should be at M14.];W[rb];B[rd];W[rn];B[rm];W[od]C[Bad style. A14 is still the key point. You are just helping black to get a big territory on the right. Since your group at the bottom is still thin, you can't play reducing moves like P11. Blacks right side has grown very big - and the exchange WR6 BQ7 has helped black a lot.]
