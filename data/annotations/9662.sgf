hi. this way an interesting game to look over. his failed invasion at 116 followed by slow move at 136 is when the game really went you way. after that you had a 5-10 point lead throughout the endgame.

you both played well. very tight game switching leads constantly. ya'll are well matched. see email for a summary of important comments.

I think the biggest problem for you in this game was the way you handled the fight on the left. you had these two groups which were split by a living white group. you had to play a lot of moves to deal with them and they didn't make you any points. i think moves 31 and 39 are to blame. 31 could have been used to makes a base and take away white's base. and 39 should have been used to make a moyo. try to focus on using the groups you have to form potential at 39 one move changes your string of weak stones into a scary moyo.

The other thing i noticed toward the middle way you seemed to focused on the center. around 80-100. usually more points to be made in the corner/side.]
;B[pd]C[Hello!];W[dc]C[I hope you enjoy this game!];B[pp]C[Took quite a while to play, but I enjoyed every minute.]
;W[dq]C[You'll find out how much time we spent, at the end of this game record.

Now the the game!];B[pj]LB[cn:C][dn:D][co:A][do:B]C[I was is a good mood, and had not played a game of GO in about three weeks, so I was wanting to play faster, bigger moyo, fight game.

But this is wrong with his facing 3-4s.  I should play (A)-(D).



--C--
this move can't be wrong... it looks perfectly fine];W[nq]C[I'd prefer to approach the upper 4-4 as white.]

you can consider the pincer here instead.];W[jp];B[cn];W[do]

[ce:B][cf:C][lq:A]C[Too slow?

--C
Yes, I think its too slow. Invasion still open at A(M3). Securing top left corner or approaching top right corner seem much bigger]

(;B[dl]LB[jd:A]C[White suggested Black play (A)K16 instead.  I felt my group should be strengthened.

Thoughts?  Is there a more common move?

--C

this is a mistake. it is gote and overconcentrated. you group is ok - he may attack but your group is flexible.]
;W[nc]LB[ce:C][cf:D][dj:A][dl:B]C[--C

mistake. after you played at B white A stone is weak. white should play C or D to support his weak stone and secure the corner]
;B[ce]LB[nd:D][de:C][cf:A][df:B]C[Black needs to break up any formation white might get first.

Is this correct?

Are (A-C) superior options?

What about (D)?

What approach might be "best?"

--C

very good tenuki! good move. higher at C would be better in my opinion but its the direction of play that really matter.]
;W[dg]LB[fc:C][cd:A][de:B][cg:D]C[This is incorrect, right?  Should white exchange (A) for (B) then take (C)?

--C
this seems ok direction for white. he is playing from his weaker stones and keeping your top left group weak. it is correct but i would say lower would be better.. like D]

(;B[dd]LB[ef:A]C[I searched for about an hour here.  Read through pages of joseki.  I came to the conclusion that (A) is my best option for complication.

Is that completely wrong?];W[cc]LB[ec:A]C[I didn't realize at the time that I could refute with (A).

--C
this does not look like a good idea for white. he is taking the corner which means you get more on the outside. but you guys are fighting... there are weak groups all around so he should focus more on outside and play A]
;B[fd];W[ec];B[ff]C[--C nice move for black.];W[fj]C[I got what I wanted.]
;B[cj];W[ci];B[dk]LB[ck:A]C[Small mistake, but (A) is better, right?

--C
Big mistake. A is much much better. because it gives your group life and makes it harder for him to live. it is essential. it doesn't seem like a big deal.. but as the fighting progresses maybe you will be able to threaten white's life if you play at A...]
;W[di];B[lc]LB[kd:A][ld:B]C[(A) or (B) better?

--C
yours is good.];W[qf]
(;B[oc]LB[qc:B][nd:A]C[--C
unusual. A is normal. B is an interesting way to play if you want to fight. I would play B here]
;W[rd];B[nd];W[qh]LB[qc:B][rj:A]C[--C
white settled down too easily here. and he can still take the corner later. he also has a nice move at A to totally destory your potential there. so this variation is not good for black]

(;B[lq]LB[fc:A]C[--C
good move. but playing at A now is essential. with A you begin to make a big framework that he must deal with. he won't have time to fix the bottom so you can get that invasion later.]
;W[lp];B[kp]C[--C
great move.];W[ko];B[kq];W[jq];B[mp];W[lo];B[mq];W[jn];B[oq]
LB[np:A]C[Small mistake, I felt it protected the corner more, but I don't think it does much.

Still worth playing it though?

--C
joseki move is at A. you do need something in this area because white has some very dangerous followups. what you played is fine.]

(;W[gb]LB[fd:B][gm:A]C[Would you poke around (A) first?

--C 
white getting this move hurts a lot. no only takes away your potential moyo but destabilizes B group.]
;B[gl]LB[bj:A]C[--C i think if you want to do something with this group. the best thing to do is just play A so that you have eyes and he doesn't. this move helps your group but it doesn't but pressure on white since he can just capture that stone at any point. plus if you play white you get a bit of cash maybe 9 points or so whereas this move gets you no points.]
;W[ge];B[df]LB[fe:A]C[Mistake again, (A) is better right?

--C
yes - this also leans on white's group. help him become stronger.]

;B[hg];W[hj]
(;B[ji]LB[ih:A][il:B]C[I now realise this doesn't accomplish much.  More of a slow move, than fancy.

--C
it is an odd shape for sure. leaves a hole at A and allows white to seal in your group if he wants to play at B.]
;W[jc]LB[il:C][ro:B][rp:A]C[--C
this is very small. invading somewhere around A or B seems important now. sealing in blacks group with C is also a nice move.

C[THE END

Thank you so much for all your help and ideas!  This is the first game I won against my friend without a handicap, which is usually 2 stones everytime we play.

Random:
This was played on an antique (90 yrs old) Kaya GO board, with Glass Double Convex GO stones.  4 1/2 hours of playtime without a break.  He drank coffee, I drank herbal tea.]
