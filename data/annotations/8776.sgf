;B[qd]C[This is a game I played over the board (not on the internet). I am 3 kyu KGs right now (bordering to 2 kyu) and my opponent is a strong 4 kyu KGS. We played the game without time controls and so it took even longer than a tournament game. I would be gratefull to receive some comments on where we went wrong and what we can improve. (Especially in the opening and early middle game.)

After Nigiri, I played White. I felt black came out better after the opening and I was struggeling hard to get something going. In the middle game, due to a misjudgements by black, I was able to capture some of his stones, which was sort of the turning point of the game.

Hello :)
I will talk a bit about the opening, since you seem to think about that area a lot. I will also focus on some main middle game ideas, as well as some common techniques.]

[fq:I]TR[id]C[This move by Black is very odd, but interesting to talk about :)

This opening position was not really seen in professional go until 1987. Even then it was not popular until 1996. Over the years, innovations have been made. 
 The most popular response from the get go was "A", starting a pattern called the mini-chinese. The main idea behind this pattern is the 5 space relation to the top right corner, like the common chinese opening. 690 out of the 1241 matches in my database have this move for Black. It was the first reply, and is still very common today.
 B is just an extreme version of A. It defends the top right corner as much as possible while maintaining that critical 5 space extension from the approach stone. It was not invented until 2002, played by Gu Li. It is now very popular as well.
 While it might be fun for me to go through all the possibilities and the possible rationale, some things become very clear looking at this. 1) The top is the main point of focus in almost all cases. 2) While tons of moves have been experimented with, Black's move in this game is not one of them. 3) The main focus of all the possibilities except C, L, M, J, and I are how to directly defend the top right corner. From the obvious FEND group to the more ambitious PHABKGO group.
 Black's move in-game is the most open move for the top. It is high, unlike P (even P is very very uncommon), and it is about as far away from the top right as you can get without playing L or I. Therefore, I think that your decision to approach the top right corner is a very good one :)]
(;B[id]C[So this move is probably not the best. It emphasizes the top left position at the expense of the top right. This move is move commonly seen when the top side has been more developed. usually as a light way for Black to reduce strong white influence in the top right, or a way for Black to defend a pretty well developed Black moyo built from strong influence in the top right.
 Again, I think your decision to play in the top right is quite appropriate to the situation.]
(;W[oc]LB[lc:C][mc:A][ld:D][md:B]C[This looks fine. Black probably should pincer on top, and White should be expecting this when he plays low here. Since Black is strong on the top side, thanks to his play before, the three-space pincers are certainly bad. I prefer A, since it is the farthest from Black's solid top left group, and it is low, so it balances it out.
C is the next best, staying low and keeping the pressure on. The high pincers seem less viable, because Black has no moyo to build, and letting White live under the top left group could seriously destabilize it for Black.]
(;B[pf]LB[kc:C][lc:B][qc:A][nq:D]C[I felt that white should rather have played at M17. In the game however, black still got a good result ...

This is not a bad move for Black, but it makes playing J16 high a little odd.

A is the most direct way of settling.]
(;W[lc]C[This move felt good ...

(I thought black would reinforce at K17 and I would slide to R18.)

This is a good move, makes sure you get your base here, and also works to destabilize Black.]
;B[pc]C[... until black played this. I now pondered to attack his group with J18. Maybe I should have played it, but I feared that black could then keep me low and possibly surround me.]
;W[od]C[So I played this standard move.];B[qj]LB[qe:A]C[Here Black has a weakness that I feel you did not realize the value of. The Black shape is thin at A.]
(;W[nq]C[Now that I look at it, I probably should have attacked at J18 instead, at the same time strengthening my own group.

Knowing that Black has a weakness in the top right can change how you think about the fighting in the rest of this game. However, the top is good in this position.]
(;B[pn];W[jp];B[jc];W[le]C[For the moment, this board position looks equal.]
;B[mo]C[This move felt very strong and I began to fear a black moyo.]
;W[lq]C[This should have been one line higher (M4) - as analysis of professional game records reveals.]
(;B[kn];W[db]C[I suspected this to be sente agains the black group]
;B[cn]
(;W[cl]C[Not sure if this is a good move - just felt I had to play something a little bit agressive instead of just playing at F3 or F4.


-- I do not think this is a good move, because it is saying that you think the left has a better chance at growing than the bottom. Especially if you can get sente, the bottom is bigger and the left is basically settled in the top right, so it is not as important.]
(;B[cq]C[I was glad that black didn't counter-pincer.

Here the left side has a lot more potential than the bottom, given that Black is already on top of you, and given that the usual sequence (the one you played) is gote). What about developing on the left?]
(;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[bn];W[em]
(;B[in]C[However, black got to take this key-point ... which was painful. Maybe my original pincer at C8 was not such good idea?

Right, If you wanted the bottom to grow, then the pincer was not the right idea.]
;W[ho]C[And I still felt I had to reply, allowing black to keep sente.]
;B[hn]C[I felt I could not allow black to keep sente]
(;W[fe]C[I wanted to profit from black's earlier tenunki after D18 and use the E7 stone to build something on the left.]
;B[jf];W[lg]C[This felt good - going into black's center and keeping the pressure on the group on the left

The group on the left is not feeling much pressure thanks to Black's strong center. Also, your left side is a little awkward with the b6 stone under it on the bottom, and with the bottom side owing a move to H7.]
(;B[li]C[A good move by black, I think. I was a bit clueless on how to answer.]
(;W[kk]C[Probably an overplay. What if black answers at K10?]
(;B[ji]C[This felt submissive by black.

This is a little less harsh on the White stone below, but that also means it is a little more dangerous above. Also, since White could nto easily be captured for sure, this is a slightly safer shape.]
;W[ik];B[io];W[ip]
(;B[hi];W[gk];B[lp];W[mp]C[Probably a bad move - I wanted to create cut-points.]
;B[np];W[mq];B[fi]LB[nf:D][qh:A][mk:C][ql:B][dn:4][fn:3][go:1]
[hp:2][fq:5]TR[an][bo][hq][kq][br][gr][hr][nr][bs][gs][ns]C[So what can white do now??

Invading the right at A (R12) or B (R8) seems too risky.
Mutal destruction at C (N9)?
Strengthening at D (O14)?

Since you do not really have a position on the left any more, C is not really mutual, just destruction. 

Just some things to consider at this point of the middle game
1) When you played D18, you wished to attack the Black group. Is that still possible?
2) How can you use the r15 weakness.
3) When is playing G5 big enough?
4) When to invade the BR corner
5) Positional Analysis:
White: NW: 15 points
           N: 5 points
           S: hanging on G5. With g5, 27, without g5...13ish?
           L: nothing right now
Black:  NE: Depends on R15, at least 5 points.
            E: (Assuming one side gets NE, one gets SE) 30
            M: Nothing right now, still open at C and from D group
            SW: 7 points
            N: nothing right now, E18 almost sente for B, M18 almost sente for Black. If Black gets it, 7 points.

So W has about 47 (if he gets the bottom) + the left
And B has about 44 (if he gets the top) + middle area.

White has to make sure that Black does not get to defend the top right or bottom right in sente, otherwise          Black gets more like 45-50 points there.
White needs to make sure that Black cannot strengthen the top is sente
White needs to make sure Black does not seal off the center in sente.

**This hinges on one very important thing. White's top right group is not easy to kill, but it is not alive yet. If Black gets a chance to, he can solidify the NE, M, and N by attacking that White group. D looks a little too passive, but certainly I think something on the top helps White all over the board. The only other main concern for White is that the three jumps in the middle are not firmly connected to anything. This makes it very likely that Black will get a chance to reduce the bottom.

In general, the more solid side profits in the endgame, and it seems to me like the Black stones an top will have an easier time settling than white's groups will.]
(;W[op];B[oo];W[no];B[nn];W[pq];B[qp];W[qq]C[Not sure if this whole gote sequence was worth it ... probably not.

This is worth a lot of points, but there seems to be the overwhelming importance of a strong top right.]
(;B[ng]C[Black is attacking my group and I should strengthen it. However, I felt I did not have the time to play a defensive move.]
;W[mh]C[So I tried to further reduce black and maybe (!) separate the black group on the left.]
(;B[oi]C[Feels submissive.

This is not only sort of defending the weakness, but it is a common loose net shape. Black could not hope to trap you with a more obvious O11. This helps by making the cuts as you poke through less severe.]

1) You should think about which sides are most open, and which sides are hardest to develop. This will help hyou out in situations like Black's corner approach.
