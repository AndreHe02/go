C[ilF: Dear reviewer thanks for the time you spent on this game. I hope to be able to make the best out of your advices.

I played White in this game and won by 7.5 points. Nevertheless I feel that my victory was a result of some mistakes Black did, since, I think, he was ahead in the opening.

By the way he requested a copy of this review too so please review both colors.
Thanks Again,
ilFuria

[Calvin\] I'll try to point out some things I notice, but  keep in mind that I am still a weak player and there are certainly many important things I don't see in this game.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp]
(;B[qj]LB[qk:A][pk:B]C[[Calvin\] The usual Chinese opening variants are at A or B.  Black 5 is actually too far to have the same effect, because there is too much space between Black 3 and 5.   But R10 is playable, and pros have tried it a few times, so I cannot say it is a bad move.]

(;W[po]C[not sure how to approach this stone. This fase leads to a lot of trouble for me

[Calvin\] This move is fine now, but only because black 5 is so far.   This would be too early in the normal Chinese fuseki though.   It's not urgent for white to approach here, however.  See variations.]

(;W[qs]TR[qp][rp]C[Until now I think that the black group marked is dead

[Calvin\] It's not.  In fact, it probably would be better for white to have capture those directly rather than play R2.  See variation.]
;B[qo]LB[qn:A]C[but now I don't know how to kill it

[Calvin\] Black should have run at A (R6).]

(;B[eo]C[[Calvin\]: This peep is not useful, and it just gives white territory.  See variation.]
;W[do];B[fn]TR[do][eo]LB[fm:A]C[[Calvin\] If we look at this shape, we see that the exchange of the two marked stones is good for white.  It would be better if black just jumped to F6 without that peep.  Right now, A (F7) would have been a better shape for black, but either way, we count the marked exchange as a loss.]
;W[cj]TR[dd][jc]LB[cc:A]C[[Calvin\] Although locally white's extension may look pretty, globally it forms a low double wing.  This formation is to be avoided because if black invades at A (C17) next, white 's marked stones will not wind up in a useful location.]

(;B[jo]LB[fq:A]C[[Calvin\]: This move is too high and overconcentrated.  Black has invested a lot of stones at the bottom, yet white can still play at A later and reduce black's territory.   See variation.]
;W[nc];B[ne]LB[rm:A][qf:B][cc:C]C[[Calvin\] I'm not sure I agree with black's strategy.  This move is used to make moyo, but because white has the move at A in reserve, I don't think this is possible.  Locally, I would play at B, but the  invasion at C is still possible.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[fd]C[[Calvin\]:  Now it's a little harder for white to invade the left side.]
;B[sm]
(;W[so]C[[Calvin\] Black decides to close off the side.  Why does white answer here?  Even though black will probably connect, is it very small.]
;B[ro];W[rm]C[stupid stupid mistake...

[Calvin\] We all suffer from illusions like this from time to time.  :-)]
;B[sq]C[[Calvin\] The biggest problem is that this capture is absolute sente.]
;W[sr];B[pm]LB[fk:A]C[[Calvin\]: This is the kind of move you play when you think you're winning.  These stones would be heavy for white to try to save.   Black should tenuki, maybe expanding has moyo around A, but there are a lot of good points.]
;W[sp]LB[eq:A]C[[Calvin\] This move is tiny, best saved for very late yose.   White must be shaken up from previous mistake.  Compare the size of this move to something in the A (E3) area!]
;B[ql]TR[pr][qq][rq][rr][qs][sr][sp]SQ[qj][pm][pn][np][op][oo]
[oq][or][pq][qp][qo][ro][rp][rn][sm]C[[Calvin\] Black lives in mortal fear of the slightest aji.   Black has played 16 stones in the lower right now, to white's 10.  His thickness is huge, but I'm not sure it's worth 6 extra stones!  Ponder this.]
;W[fq]LB[je:B][ej:A][eq:C][qb:D]C[Maybe A or B were better than this?

[Calvin\] C is double sente.  A and B are also very big, but gote.   D is a very large gote, too.]

(;W[er];B[gr];W[je];B[os];W[ps];B[mh]C[After this black move I feel that I have to do something about his territory being so big... My next move certainly is a mistake but what should I have done instead?

[Calvin\] This move is too conservative, but black is about 20 points ahead.   It's hard for me to recommend which overplay is best.  However, it's possible for your opponent to throw 20 points in the endgame, so it's still early.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[el];B[gl];W[fj];B[fk]C[[Calvin\] This just helps white.]
;W[ek];B[gk]C[[Calvin\]: Wow.  Misclick? White may have a chance now.]
;W[gj];B[hk]LB[hj:A]C[[Calvin\] Black is just throwing points away.  Certainly the hane at A is better.]
;W[ii]C[[Calvin\] Super!  By getting ahead in the pushing battle, white turns the tables.]
;B[jk]C[[Calvin\]: Black still believes he is winning.];W[lj]
LB[qb:A]C[[Calvin\] This stone is too easy to cut off.   A is the biggest move, I think.]

;W[hj]
(;B[ik];W[ji]LB[ce:A][cd:B][qb:C]C[[Calvin\] Why connect here?  Certainly playing at A or B to reduce black invasion chances in the corner is bigger.  C (R18) is large, too.   Any of these moves could actually turn around the game for white right now, without relying on a black slip-up.   Black 87 is not sente!   Don't answer.]
;B[kg];W[jg];B[kf]C[maybe the variation was better...]
(;W[jf]LB[cd:A]C[[Calvin\] Proper, but maybe small.  White could just seal off the corner more with a move at C15 or so.]

(;B[cc]C[[Calvin\] This is the most open area, so some kind of invasion is good.]
;W[cd]
(;B[dc]LB[ec:A][db:B][bd:C]C[[Calvin\] For black, this move is a mistake in this situation, because for white to play at A (hane at the head of two stones) is too good for white.  Black should play B or C.  See variations for some  choices for black.]
;W[ec]SQ[fd]LB[ed:A]C[[Calvin\] Because of white's marked stone, there is no cut at A, so this is very good for white.]
;B[eb];W[fb];B[ea];W[bc];B[bb];W[bd];B[ab];W[ca]LB[fa:A]C[[Calvin\] This move doesn't kill.  White should just seal off black in sente by playing at A.]

[qd:B]C[I think this is the fatal mistake of black, since it let me play the following sequence in sente

[Calvin\] I agree.  Black needs to play at A (R18) to protect the cut.   Even if black solidly connects at B, his lead is impossible to reverse.]
;W[ob];B[od];W[qd]C[[Calvin\] Given the current board situation, this cut is commendable for white.]
;B[qe];W[rd]
(;B[rc]LB[re:A]C[[Calvin\] This is an all-or-nothing move, but I think black may be better off cutting his losses with A.  See variation.]
;W[re];B[pe];W[rb];B[rf];W[rg];B[pf]LB[sf:B][qg:A]C[A or B? I couldn't see A in the game but maybe it is better

[Calvin\] Usually, B is better, but here in the late endgame, A gets more points.   But right now it doesn't matter; white's lead is definitive.]

LB[so:A]C[I think this was a mistake too

;W[so];B[rl];W[sq];B[sg];W[tt]TR[sp]SQ[pm][pn][gk][hk][mh]C[[Calvin\]

Black threw away a promising lead in the endgame, but I think he played too conservatively following white's early mistakes, and this enabled white to catch up and eventually take advantage of an endgame slip.   Black's moves at 28, 47, 59, 67, and 69 could all have been played more aggressively without incurring much risk at all.

Black's peep at 31 and push at 65 were vulgar, aji-keshi moves.  Without 31, white would have made less territory on the left side and without 65, black would have had more options invading the top left.  One has to develop the feeling that these types of moves, when played too early in the game, lose points, because they do by closing off opportunties.

White lost a lot in the lower right corner by missing the chance to keep black unsettled and losing the cutting stones.  White's biggest mistake is following black around answering small moves.  Simple reading mistakes (below one's level, like white 44) and answering your opponent's small moves often come from playing too fast.  If you're playing fast, it's easy to just find a reasonable local answer to your opponent's moves; it takes a little bit more time to ask yourself: is that really sente?  (Hint: an atari on one stone may not be sente :-) If not, where's the biggest area of the board?   I cannot tell whether this was a fast game, but sometimes slower games are good to get out of the habit of automatic play.

Here's a story from Janice Kim 3p that I really like:

"When Jujo Jiang 9P was visiting in New York many years ago, we used to have a lot of fun where he would play endless games, giving even the high dan players enormous handicaps and just demolishing them. Periodically just for fun he would shout 'Atari!' and his opponent would scramble to connect, even when not actually in atari. Jujo never took more than a few seconds to move, except for just once, when his opponent played a move and Jujo looked at him in astonishment and said, 'That's sente!' He must have played 10,000 moves during his visit, and only once did someone play a move that he thought was necessary to answer. But his opponents answered every move without fail, atari or no, because Jujo was really good at making his moves look like sente."]
