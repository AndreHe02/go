C[Hi I am Daniel Winteler and I played w in this game. I won but I think I 
would and should have lost if b did not make a stupid mistake at the end.I 
guess some major problems I have are the fuseki and how to reduce adverse 
moyos the best way.Just focus on the points that are the most important in 
youre 
yes.];B[pc];W[dp];B[dd];W[po];B[pq];W[qq];B[oo]
(;W[pn];B[qr];W[qp];B[nq]C[vlkplk: Basic joseki is P2 for black. It seems that now there is some weak 
point, but it can be exploited later, since ladder is favorable for black 
now.]
(;W[rr]C[vlkplk: By playing S12, white forced black to strengthen himself,for which 
black was just happy. I would keep move like S12 for later, where it would 
be possible to decide, which is more profitable - S12 or, for ex. white Q4 
or something else.];B[pr];W[qk];B[qf];W[qh]C[Too small?
vlkplk: Actualy, I like move like this. It's not small at all. When black is 
allowed to play there, for ex. at R11, he will get 1)some points along the 
side, 2)sente, since white has to defend somehow against black's invasion 
at R7.];B[fq]
(;W[eq]C[Perhaps is H3 better to  prevent b from building a moyo on the lower side?
vlkplk: H3 is questionable, since blacks forces at lower right will back-up 
some future atack against H3.On the other hand, white E3 is usually played 
in situation, when white has already somestone around K3. Now it doesn't 
press black, since it is black's stones there and not white's.So instead, I 
would try something like F5, to prevent black from building too large 
moyo.];B[fp];W[dn];B[fn];W[dl]
(;B[jp]C[vlkplk: This black's move seems a bit too defensive. It secures points 
along the side, but has no other purpose. I would prefer F8 instead of 
this.];W[ko]C["Reduce a moyo gently with a shoulder hit."A correct application of that 
proverb?
vlkplk: I think it's good move. Another move which I like is K6. It doesn't 
go so deep into black's moyo, but has more options toward the center and can 
cooperate with both left-side and right-side white's 
stones.];B[kp];W[lo];B[mq]
(;W[mm]C[vlkplk: Here, white cannot connect easily his two stones in the middle 
with right side.So I would prefer to make right or left side stones 
stronger, which would help stones in the middle indirectly.]
;B[on];W[nl]C[I guess I was too afraid of being cut];B[pm]C[vlkplk: It is bad to let black play hane at 
Q7.];W[qm];B[jc];W[cf];B[ci];W[cj];B[di];W[cc]C[I thought some tome of whether to invade here or to play the tobi at E14. 
I came to no result so I just acted spontaneously.

;W[af];B[ef];W[de];B[og]C[vlkplk: Now black is strong in the center, but white can try to reduce the 
moyo, for example by something likeK14. K15 would be too deep, black can 
play counter cap at K13.];W[rg];B[rf]C[I had no idea how to prevent b from building a large framework on the 
upper side.];W[oh];B[ng];W[nh];B[mg];W[qc]C[I dont know any rules to invade corner enclosures. I would appreciate it 
if you could give me a hint for further reading on the topic of how to 
invade corner enclosures resp. shimaris. Here I just tried and the result 
was not so bad I think.
vlkplk: 1)it should be played earlier, before sequence starting with white 
S13 was played. Now black has strong wall to use for killing white in 
corner. For ex. black Q18. 2)usually move like this is played just to see 
black's response and to keep some options for making ko for life in the 
corner, when right time comes.]

reducing black's territory along the upper side, black has got a great 
chance to build nice territory in center, which he missed, 
anyway.];B[mh];W[nj]

center, as M10(natural continuation after black's N12) or the like, was 
better.];W[pl]C[vlkplk: White's Q10 was not so important at this moment.]
;B[om];W[ol]C[That move was not necessary I guess. I should have taken sente. E.g. save 
the lower left corner.
vlkplk: Definitely not necessary. White lost sente.];B[cq]C[I should have enclosed the corner earlier I guess. Did b (or w) make any 
mistake in the following moves so that I could have prevented b from 
invading the corner?];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[br];W[dr]C[vlkplk: Since white had later to connect atE4 and lost sente again, it was 
better for him to simply descend at E2 instead of D2. Then black must make 
life somehow in the corner and white can play monkey jump as far as H1 and 
reduce black's territory in sente.Better to "let live small in the corner" 
and surround opponents stones, while taking sente.];B[cr];W[dq]
;B[aq]
(;W[kj]C[Too defensiv? What would have been the best way to reduce bÂ´s moyo on the 
upper side? (Perhaps around K12?)
vlkplk: If white's purpose was solely to reduce black's territory, he could 
play as far as K12. But this L10 was better, since it reduces,while attempts 
at building territory at the same time.Usuall way of thinking when there are 
two competing territory frameworks on the board like this, is try to imagine 
the boarder line between them and to play on it. The boarder now leads from 
N12 to 
F8.];B[ji];W[ki];B[kh];W[jj];B[ii];W[ij];B[dj];W[ck];B[hi];W[in]
