C[Allow me to introduce myself; the name is Jason and I am around 1d by the australian rankings~ I hope you find this review helpfull ^_^]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[qq]C[hmmmm];W[cp]LB[ce:A][eq:B]C[I love playing the 3x4. Playing on the corner hoshi is rare in my games. I guess you could say that my opening is very old fashioned.
-Nothing wrong with it just note that a shimari (white A and B) is quite urgent]
;B[oc];W[qk]C[This was to prevent a good extension along the edge whilst pressuring the lower right.
-Thats good thinking but i do think that because of the low position of R3 its not so urgent]
;B[qi]C[A powerfull extension and combined attack~];W[pp];B[qp]
;W[po];B[or]
(;W[qo]C[r9 was ideally placed for this and leaves me in sente.
- firstly it isn't sente- not even w Q4 is sente black could ignor and go E3 or E4 or something similar. Second it may look good but its not that big. and finally if the side was interesting you should of gone Q5. "attacking" at Q4 is saying that you think the centre is interesting]
;B[np]C[I think a kakari on the C4 stone would be better- the corner is safe for now]
;W[eq]C[hmmm
At this point white is behind by a little so should be a little more bold~ maybe F3]
;B[de];W[di]C[Both the kakari and the pincer here are very good]
;B[ge]C[This confused me since I do not know of a joseki for this move, in any case there was pressure on the side so I extended before I thought about attacking. I'm also aiming at an extension to d8.]
;W[gc];B[dk];W[ej];B[fl];W[ek];B[dm]C[A bit confusing, but I continue to push through.]
;W[el];B[em];W[gj]C[I can comfortably attack both black groups above and below so I try and make good shape.]
;B[hm];W[fn];B[eo]C[Another confusing move so I cut anyway knowing that the white stones can'y be killed.]
;W[fm];B[gl];W[en];B[dn];W[do];B[co];W[dp];B[bn];W[dl];B[cl]

(;W[ck]C[Apparently my brother (black) saw a scary move at w c7, b c6, w b8.
-Well i think its certainly better than this];B[bp];W[bq];B[aq]
;W[ar];B[ap];W[cr];B[bl]
(;W[cm]C[wastes a ko threat];B[cn]
(;W[ef]C[No good, sure it attacks but you get nothing from it.
E16 attacks it also makes the upper group more stable also i think E15 is interesting.]
;B[ed]C[I was expecting e15, at which point I would play f16 then switch to h6.]

[bs][cs][dr][dq][ds][er][ep][fo][eo][fp][fq][fr][fs][es]C[Currently i'm enjoying this because there are some weak groups to exploit.
- Yet white is in a pretty dangerous position
White is currently around 35 on board while black has around 48 black is ahead on points alone also black has the advantage in overall board position]
;B[iq]C[Yes];W[im]
(;B[go];W[gn];B[oi]C[I didn't know how to go about this enclosure, so going by the saying "when in doubt... tenuki".
- There is a number of things you could try here but i do think its too big to ignore, maybe an extension around L17~ you don't want black getting that too - or you can make a contact play at R15 or O17 or something]
;W[kq];B[jo]C[This took me be surprise, I was expecting L4.
-L4 is attaching to a weak stone and will only help it get stronger]
;W[ip];B[jq];W[ko];B[lq];W[lp];B[kr];W[jp]C[I thought I had more ko threats so this seemed beneficial for me.]
;B[lr]C[Black wimps out of a fight so I connect without hesitation.
-Black can't really play Ko here he did the right thing];W[kp]
;B[jc]
(;W[je]C[I believe that this is the standard approach for reducing a moyo.
-You need to do more than reduce moyo I would of gone deeper. Or you could do L16]
;B[ld];W[og]C[Now there was a slight mistake here because we were playing over msn since kgs was down and I thought my brother said L16, not M16. A couple of moves were played before it was realised.]
;B[mg];W[mh]C[Its at this point that I realise that I can't get very far into blacks territory because of the earlier mistake. I realise that my only chance to win is to make a lot of territory in the centre, the kind of game I hate. I thought about O12, but black would have been able to push my weak white group for a bit and destroy all hopes of making territory in the centre.]
;B[pk]C[Another unexpected move.
-I think black should probably cut white here];W[pl];B[qj]C[bad direction~ the shape move is p9]
;W[ok];B[pj];W[nh];B[ol];W[om]C[I try and make a ponnuki shape towards the centre and let black have the profit on the side since I know that with the resulting continuation, black can only push one space into my moyo above.]
;B[ql]C[Should of extended.];W[nl];B[eh];W[dh];B[fd];W[cc]C[thats big]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[hc];W[lg]C[At this stage this struck me as the biggest move on the board at the time. Black ignores.
-Yes very big];B[dg];W[eg]C[Maybe H13 or G13 is better];B[gg]
C[I could save the stones but I was worried about black pushing any further into my territory so I was forced to defend. This part of the game I hate; forever having to defend waiting to get sente again.]
;W[hh];B[if];W[jg];B[jf];W[kf];B[ig];W[ih];B[fh];W[me]C[At last, sente!]
;B[md];W[hb];B[hq]C[Big];W[gq];B[nj];W[mj];B[mp];W[mn];B[cd]
;W[ic];B[jb];W[qm];B[rk];W[nd];B[nc];W[bc]C[Once again this seemed to be the biggest move on the board at the time.]
;B[bd];W[ad];B[ae];W[ac];B[bh];W[ro]C[An intersting move that defends the cut and secures territory.
-Not sure this is the biggest];B[rp];W[pq]C[This was to set up t4 in sente.]
;B[pr];W[sp];B[rr];W[qg]C[good];B[rm];W[rn]C[Should tenuki~ only worth 2 or 3 points]
;B[rh];W[re];B[qe];W[rf]C[I missread here. Black could cut my group from the centre and the only hope I had was to make a ko. I thought I had more ko threats anyway so I followed this course rather than cutting loose my stones on the side.]
;B[qf];W[rg];B[pg];W[ph];B[pf];W[qh]
(;B[ri]C[Worry over, black gives in so I get to connect in sente too.
-Black had no choice.. the cut at P12 doesn't work for black]
;W[oh]C[I think could of done S16 first];B[rd];W[sd];B[sc];W[se]
;B[rc];W[bk];B[gi];W[hi];B[sq];W[al]C[This was the reason that I played c7.
-No, it was a bad move no matter how you look at it
See variation near start of game A8 is always sente];B[bm];W[kd]
;B[kc];W[oq];B[nq];W[hp]C[I couldnt think of a bigger move than this.]

C[Its at this point that I am confident of victory so I am just trying to wrap things up, black my brother of course rarely resigns and plays to the bitter end.]
;B[ib];W[id];B[ie];W[jd];B[lf];W[kg];B[ha];W[gb];B[gd];W[eb]
C[Once again another message to my brother to say I have won.]
;B[bi];W[sm];B[rl];W[sh];B[sg]C[Clever move forces me to play at m12 later on. The rest of the moves I don't feel require much comment.]

;W[ei];B[op];W[oo];B[so];W[sn];B[sp];W[tt];B[df]C[Black would eventually have to play here due to the cut at b15 and the agi of the three white stones to the right. Game over, I won. All in all play started at about 11 in the morning and run to about midnight (of course we stopped to get food).]
;W[tt];B[tt]C[Black had the upper hand for the begining of the game and much of the middle game. He showed the right attitude i think with moves like J3 and K17
However in the end of mid game and going into ooyose black became rather timid, played in the wrong direction at times and seemingly didn't notice whites potential building up in the center untill it was too late. It all went wrong for black starting with R10 i think
This should have been a black win judging by his play at the start. Black needs to play consistantly throughout the game. White needs to improve in the opening. 
Hope you got something out of this review- any questions feel free to drop my a mail *_*]
