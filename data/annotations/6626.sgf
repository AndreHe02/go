thachdau [1d\]: hi

Hello!

I will use all my ability to give as good advice as possible, I hope it will prove useful for you! There are always many options and it's not easy for anyone to find the best moves. It was a close game and many things could have turned the game into a black victory. It is difficult to say which mistakes were the most decicive, I will just give my personal opinions about some moves. My comments will start with "Kalle: "

I think you made some slow moves in the beginning and middle game, but I found a lot of things to comment on in the endgame. The value of moves is the greatest in the early part of the game, so even a few mistakes count for a lot. But a lot can be done in the endgame to catch up, too. Maybe you should think more about how to get things in sente. This applies both to the middle game and the end game.

regards,
Kalle T.];W[nc];B[pf];W[fc];B[jd];W[df];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[ec]
;B[dc];W[ge];B[de];W[dh];B[ff];W[hc]C[Kalle: I think it would be really important to prevent a white extension on the left side, but the timing is important too. The upper side seems now more important.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[ld];W[nf];B[kf];W[qh]C[maybe playing r10 would be better?
expecting something like this to happen

Kalle: White is just trying to get himself into trouble by creating two weak groups. You should strike between the white forces by playing P13! The most important thing is to keep the white stones separated. See my variation for a possible continuation.]

(;B[qg]C[Kalle: This move is bad because it helps white to seal you in. You should not give white the nice move of q12, which he takes next.]
;W[ph];B[og]C[Kalle: This is the right move, but you could have played it two moves earlier and get better shape for yourself and a worse shape for your opponent.]
;W[ng];B[oh];W[nh]C[Kalle: White is forcing black to separate the white groups, which is a bad strategy for white. But it is difficult to find good moves now that white has made two weak groups in the same part of the board. Black should take full advantage of the situation.]
;B[oi]C[Kalle: This is the obvious point. Now white has a hard time handling his stones.]
;W[qj]C[i think i should have played l12 puts more pressure on black]

(;B[ob]C[Kalle: This move is defensive and it's an endgame move really. The action is now in the center and the right side, where the two white groups are vulnerable to attack. Playing p18 at this point is almost like passing a turn. You lost a lot of points here.]
;W[kh]C[Kalle: White takes the vital point.];B[ig];W[hg];B[hh]
;W[gg];B[jh];W[ki];B[ij];W[mk];B[ok];W[ql];B[mj];W[lj];B[mi]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[lf];B[le];W[me]LB[mb:A]C[Kalle: Here it is worth noticing that you have a connection at the point A.]

(;B[lh]C[Kalle: This is a "thank you" move, white gets to fix his weakness for free, and black gains nothing from this move. You could try to atari at M13 instead, I guess you'll get to eat the stone in sente. Maybe you could have cut the white forces by playing at M13 a little earlier.]
;W[lg];B[om];W[pg]LB[of:B][qf:A]C[Kalle: Here you have to choose whether to connect at A or B. I think there's no reason to give away the stone at R13, because the corner is safe and the black stones on the outside can take care of themselves, and anyway white has to cut in gote if he wants to. So you can play at A.]

(;B[of];W[qf];B[qe];W[rg]C[Kalle: The nasty thing here is that the white group is now absolutely secure and black's corner got smaller.]
;B[mm];W[jk];B[ik];W[jm];B[il];W[jl];B[hn]C[Kalle: The last few moves gave black influence facing the left side, he would like to play there first after this.]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[nm];B[nn];W[ml]LB[ck:B][mm:A]C[Kalle: White made a mistake here. He has to defend unless he wants to give up the stones he just played on the board. But the stone A is not that important anymore, you could play somewhere else now, to take a big point, B for example.]
;B[mn];W[nq];B[lq];W[qq]LB[nq:A]C[do u think  q3 is better?

Kalle: The stone A was deep, but it's difficult to know what to do. I think the most important thing is to get sente to play on the left side.]

(;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr]LB[of:A]TR[op][pp][qp]C[Kalle: The marked stones aren't very useful, but since you're connected at A you could now tenuki and take a big point on the left side instead of playing N4.]
;B[mp]C[Kalle: This stone is a bit overconcentrated and it's gote, which is relly bad because white gets to play first on the left side.]
;W[cf]
(;B[ce]C[Kalle: This move is not a good shape. I think you should play B15.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[bp]C[should i have taken the corner?

Kalle: I think it's good to try to be active on the left side and give up the corner. The fact is that once white has played C6, you have to give him something, there's not much you can do about it.]

(;B[dl];W[cq];B[fg];W[gh]LB[ei:A]C[Kalle: Here you could play A for example, since you cannot be cut and you have the connection at N18.]

(;B[hi];W[fh];B[eg];W[eh];B[dg];W[cg];B[ci]C[Kalle: I guess this peep is ok.]
;W[ch];B[jo];W[im];B[hm];W[gk]C[Kalle: I think this white move is an overplay. You can just cut it.]

(;B[gl];W[el]
(;B[em]LB[ek:A]C[Kalle: You could also play A.];W[dk]
(;B[dm]LB[cl:A]C[Kalle: You can play A.];W[ck]
(;B[cl]C[Kalle: This is bad shape. You could have played it earlier, but now you can jump to the second line if you want to.]
;W[ko];B[kp];W[er];B[fr];W[eq];B[ep];W[re];B[rd];W[sd];B[rc]
;W[mh];B[li];W[kj];B[ll]LB[bk:A][rp:B]C[Kalle: This move is gote and you should not play it because you can't kill the white group. For example A and B are very big points.]
;W[lk];B[km];W[kl];B[lm];W[lb]
(;B[kb]C[Kalle: The shape point here is O18. It threatens to cut and prevents white from making an eye here at the edge while making your corner bigger and more secure. You should take it first and then play the other moves.]
;W[lc];B[kc];W[nb];B[md];W[oe];B[pe]LB[od:A][ne:B]C[Kalle: You should play at A instead. It takes one point away from white (from point B) and makes your shape stronger.]
;W[oa]C[Kalle: White can play this now because you didn't play O18 earlier.]
;B[pa];W[na];B[qb]C[Kalle: That was a two-point sente sequence for white, worth actually about four points, because white can continue elsewhere and take some more points. Considering this, you might have won the game just by playing O18 in time. Now white also has the option of making an eye on the upper side by playing at N17.]
;W[ks];B[kr];W[ls];B[js];W[mr];B[jr];W[rp]C[Kalle: It's a pity that white gets this point as well.]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[rm];W[qm];B[qn];W[bk]
(;B[bm]LB[bl:A]C[Kalle: Here you should definitely just play B8 (marked A). After B8 you can hane in sente upwards, threatening to connect to your stone at C11.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[fj];B[mc];W[mb];B[od];W[ne];B[la];W[jj]
(;B[db]LB[be:A]C[Kalle: This is a nice move, but it would be more effective on the other side of the corner (point A), because it threatens the white territory there. Here white doesn't really have any territory.]
;W[be];B[bd];W[bf]
(;B[bc]LB[bb:A]C[Kalle: This is not the best possible shape. This move can be played so that it defends simultaneously against potential intrusion from the upper side and the left side. The point A would do this.]
;W[bn]LB[ak:B][bl:A]C[Kalle: Now white is threatening to connect underneath by playing B8 and you should prevent it because it is pretty big in itself and there is the bonus of being able to play A9 (marked B) in sente after you have taken the point A to yourself first. The value of the point A could now be as much as ten points.]
;B[rk];W[qk]
(;B[sj]LB[rl:A]C[Kalle: This should be at S8 (marked A), so that you get an eye on the edge. This is important because you don't want to get into a shortage of liberties.]
;W[rl];B[sl];W[rj];B[sk];W[si];B[sm];W[so];B[rn]C[Kalle: This way white took away all of your points on the edge and got the point T5 for free at the same time.]
;W[np];B[no];W[bl]C[Kalle: This is a big gain for white.];B[cm]
;W[am];B[dq]C[!! K];W[dr];B[cp]C[Kalle: I think you should play E1 instead of this move, because it is sente as well, and it is more valuable since it secures your lower side in sente.]
;W[br];B[dn];W[co];B[do];W[ie];B[if];W[eb]
(;B[ib]C[Kalle: You could jump in further.];W[hb];B[ic];W[da]
;B[ca];W[ea];B[cb]LB[bb:A]TR[bc]C[Kalle: This sequence shows why the marked stone should be at A. White got the reduction in sente.]
;W[ke];B[kd];W[id];B[je];W[fs]C[Kalle: Now white gets this in sente too, which is a four point loss again.]
;B[gs];W[es];B[gr];W[pm];B[pn];W[oq];B[ri]C[Kalle: In general, you shouldn't play moves like this, but save them as ko-threats. You can just play Q11 straight away if you want to.]

Kalle: There were many little things in the endgame that you could have done differently, and the game would have turned favourable for you. Maybe sente and gote considerations and finding the right shapes in different situations are things that you shold think about in the future.]
