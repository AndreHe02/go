;B[pd]C[I am black.   I've made some comments about things I think I may have done wrong, but please add to this or correct my ideas.

Thanks in advace for your advice.

-Calvin

S: The main problems occured in the middle game. You have a tendency to overestimate your own groups' safety and to underestimate the opponent's groups' safety.
Meaning, you sometimes attack when you should defend. My advice to you is that you keep an eye on the whole board and not only on your opponent's groups. If you are planning to tenuki during a fight, make sure you are aware of the strategical & tactical risks involved.
Another big problem I noticed is that you try to save stones that you shouldn't. Remember it's alright to lose a stone if you can't save it or use it properly.
Another mistake was that you neglected to defend the base of one of your groups.

;B[ec];W[de];B[cb];W[cf];B[dg]TR[df]LB[cg:B][nc:A]C[Looking at this now, I think it is heavy.   Maybe tenuki would be good here, treating the marked stone lightly.   'A' might be okay to build on the top.   The hane at 'B' is sometimes played, and is lighter than this.

S: I agree, D14 stone does not help black in any way. Black has other nice alternatives, like the top or right sides, and B looks nice too.]
;W[cg];B[dh];W[ch];B[di]TR[df][dg][dh]MA[fe]C[This pushing battle may be good for white, despite pushing from behind.   It is not clear that the marked wall is useful.

S: the wall is not really influential, and it is still very weak, white can try things like D10 later in the game.
Also note that now, because b saved his group, the white group stabilizied itself in sente, while erasing much of the usefullness of the wall.
W's key stone is F15(marked), which is very strong.];W[cc];B[db]
LB[bb:A]C[Extending at A is probably safe here.

S:Yes it is. But after c17, white can't die anyway, so for now the corner isn't really urgent. There are still big points on the right and top sides.]
;W[kc];B[mc];W[hc];B[gc];W[md];B[nc]
(;W[ld]
(;B[qe]LB[hd:A]C[Maybe slow.   How about 'A' instead?

S: for now this is not urgent. The white group is still weak. Attacking it can be abit hard actually, because F15 is strong and black may put D11 into risk.
To me, A doesn't look severe enough, white can find ways to run with the rest of the group.]
;W[hb];B[bc]TR[fe][fp][ld][md][pn]C[S:Good idea, only to make sure C18 will live there.
At this point b is losing alot in influence, so it's quite important not to have weak groups.
I marked some influential w stones, and in contrast, D11 is not really thick. For example, imagine a white goup running into it. The wall will immediately become short of liberties.
Black has some territorial lead.];W[bd];B[dc];W[cd];B[ab];W[ef]
;B[jd]C[This could be an overplay.  It becomes weak.

S:It can be treated as kikashi(forcing move, meaning you can abandon the stone), though it looks more like aji-keshi(erasing your own possibilities), for example consider b K18 which is now not possible.
It should also be noted that if you wish to play there, you should probably have done it before w H18, because with an eye on the side every of your moves is less threatening and there are less weaknesses to exploit.]
;W[jc]
(;B[id]C[S:This is a big mistake. Black must give up K16 unless he has some good way of continuing.
A move like this can cost b the game.];W[hd]C[S:B now has another heavy group which does absolutely nothing. It doesn't exert influence due to short of liberties.]
;B[he];W[ge]C[S: This is also risky because b is locking F17 group in.]
;B[if]C[Getting cut off like this is painful.  Of course, white is also cut, but I think black is weaker.

S: This is terrible for black. Black should never have given white an option to attack something. Right when b realised K16 is weak it should have been abandoned.
White is ahead on influence so this gives him a very good attack. Also B shape very bad here, consider w H14, or, b H14 w K14.]
;W[hf];B[ie]
(;W[hg];B[ig];W[nd]C[Nice idea for white, also nice timing, maybe better to first hane at J12 though. But i'm not sure how urgent this is for black.]

(;B[ih]C[S: Looks very slow to me. A keima or one point jump would be better to run with. And a hane can use H13's shortage of liberties.]
;W[hh];B[np]SQ[df][dg][dh][di]TR[nq][pn]LB[oo:A][ql:B]C[I think there may be some value in trying to split white's two stones, but this may not be the move.   Playing at A is more common,  I think, but B is a good point too.   It's worth noting that black's D14 wall has been neutralized, so those moves are wasted.   Ideas?

S: Yep, D14 is getting weaker all the time, and it never did help black. J12 is still in alot of trouble, so while this splitting move is the correct idea locally, strategically it might harm J12.
But if black manages to make a weak white group this can develop into a big fight. Here I can see w giving O3 and playing something like O6, and when b N3 white J11. which puts alot of pressure on b.
And if B wants the right side, I would prefer Q9, to make a bit better balance.(also makes it easier for J12)]
;W[mp];B[no];W[pk]C[Nice manuever by white. N4 forces O5 which forces Q9.]
;B[qi]C[S:Locally this is a great attacking move, but now, if white does something like P11 or P10, J12 will be nearly dead.
This move forces white to attack black.];W[oi];B[oh]SQ[he][id]
[ie][if][ig][ih][jd]C[This move is probably bad strategically.   I am attempting to separate white's groups, but black's marked group is weak and heavy.

S:W doesn't care too much. O16 is strong. and P11 is light and influential, and b is forcing white to play moves in this area, meaning, to weaken J12.]
;W[oq]C[S: If i were W i wouldn't care that much right now. If b wasted two moves on O3 white will kill J12.]
;B[op];W[od]C[S: Very bad. White helps b fix his shape, without making any real gain. White is destroying the possibility of P17, and this is bad shape for white(getting w's head hit)

Also, if b ignored O16 it means he doesn't care that much for O17, so now white lets b off the hook. B can take this oppurtunity to save J12 while white takes O17 with two moves instead of one.]
;B[oc];W[nh];B[og];W[mi];B[mf]LB[ii:A]C[This may be neglecting defense.   Do you think black might have to extend at A before attempting to cut off white?

S: You're having the wrong idea. Black is defending here, not attacking!
B is in no position to attack any white group on the board. White is ahead in influence and strength, and P11 is light enough to live if necessary.
If w had a stone right now at A, b had no chance of living with J11.]
;W[lf];B[lg];W[mg];B[ng]LB[nf:A]C[Maybe I could just play at A instead of playing the atari and then coming back to connect.

S: Yes, this way b eliminates the possibility of b M12.(ajikeshi)]
;W[mh];B[nf]C[S: This is an obvious mistake.J12 is the important group here, not N14. N14 is small.

Again you are attacking instead of defending.
It looks nearly impossible both to save J12 and seperate the w groups]
;W[kg]C[S: Personally i'd prefer something calmer, like L14.]
;B[lh]C[S: Did you misread the ladder here or anything? Or did you just try to make things complicated?
One one hand it's sente so it doesn't ruin too much...but does it gain anything?]

(;W[kh];B[ii];W[li]MA[pf][pg][ph][qf][qg][qh][rf][rg][rh]C[The past few moves seem to be a loss for black.   Some territory has been gained, but white's shape is strong (though overconcentrated).   The real clincher, though, seems to be that black J11 group now has to escape.

S:J11 is very weak right now.];B[hi];W[ci];B[dj]C[S: The bad shape from earlier haunts black.]

S:Yep, However....(look at variation)];W[kd];B[qm]C[S: now this is a purely territorial move.]

;B[fk];W[bk];B[ek];W[cl]C[S: Now W J9 becomes very good. It ruined a potential eye in sente, and now that potential eye is discovered as crucial.]

;B[en];W[dk];B[ej];W[fh]C[S: I don't think this is needed, and why not at F13?
Also b isn't 100% alive yet. A move around H7 may force b to play B7 and then w perhaps could make some points around K6.]
