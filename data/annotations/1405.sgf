dear reviewee,

hello, it is my pleasure to review your game; i will try my best. if there is any error your find or opinion that you may not consent with me, please let me know; i will be happy to learn something from you. let's make progress together.

P.R.China];B[cp]C[generally, black plays his first move at the upper-right corner to show respect to his rival.]
;W[cd]LB[dc:A][eq:B][ec:C][cj:D]C[if white does want to play at the upper-left komoku, A(d17) seems more usual.  because if both enclose their corners with B(E3) and C(E17) respectively, it is black's sente to occupy D(c10), which is obviously good point for both.]
;B[pd];W[qp]LB[pq:A]C[again, if white does want to play at the lower-right komoku, A(q3) seems natural. because theoretically when both have symmetrical komoku like the stone 1 and 4, the one who has sente to kakari is of more advantage.]
;B[oq]C[this is what i have just mentioned.];W[pn]LB[ep:A]C[white's 6 has an alternative at A(e4).]
;B[iq]C[good shape for black];W[qf];B[qq]LB[nc:A]C[slow move. we can expect white gains sente here and play double kakari at A(o17). black's answer at A is honte and good enough.]
;W[rq];B[pp];W[qo];B[qr];W[nc];B[qh]LB[qj:B][oe:A]C[i think it is too aggressive in this kind of position, when white is relatively thick in the right. white's A(p15) and B(r10) combination will be proved excellent for:
1. enclosing black in the corner;
2. attacking black's 15;
3. extending from white'6.

i am afraid black has no proper answer to white's 14, from which we can see the fault of black's 9.]
;W[qj]LB[oe:A]C[i think white may enclose black with A(p15) first, which is absolutely sente and can make white's upper-right thick when black tries to make alive in the corner.]
;B[pf]
(;W[qe]LB[qc:A]C[this is not formalized.

white has an alternative to make territory by invading into A(r17).

see variation please.]
(;B[pg]LB[pe:A]C[
i prefer A(q15) to connect, which is thick.

;B[qk];W[pj];B[pk];W[ok];B[rj];W[ph]LB[ri:A][ol:B]C[to my study, white may block at A(s11) here, and can not be proved bad, very complex though.   or if white wants simple and safe, he should play B(p8), which is the key point for white's connection, i think. even if black can make alive inside, white will get outside thickness automatically and in sente, which is good enough.]

see variation please.];B[mc]LB[rl:A]C[it leaves the main battlefield, may be losing move if black loses. A(s8) instead makes black flexible and good eye shape.]
;W[nn];B[oo]LB[rr:A]C[bad, it makes white strong.

black's lower-right corner can not be attacked easily, because it has A(s2).]
;W[nm];B[nl]LB[ml:A]C[if no white's 40, black may jump to A(n8).]
;W[ml]LB[rl:A]C[it is time for white's A(s8), which is sente.]
;B[mk];W[nk]LB[ll:A][rl:B]C[white's extend at A(m8) instead of 44:
1. makes white strong,  2. damage black's lower side influence,  3. continue to aim at black's right group.

achieve 3 goals in one move.

you know, black can defend himself with ko at B(s8), which is a kind of flexible shape and can not collapse easily. what's more, black do have more ko threats than white, because he can fight the ko while make alive simultaneously.]
;B[rl];W[sj];B[sk];W[rk];B[ll]C[good ko threat];W[mm];B[rj]
;W[si]LB[qi:A]C[this move makes black's cut at A(r11) available, if black wins the ko.]
;B[rn]
(;W[rk]C[how about...

see variation please.];B[ro];W[sl]LB[rp:A][qi:B]C[black's cut at A(s4) is very very big, because it:
1. connects the two weak group and makes them alive;
2. gains the corner territory.

i guess white's 56 is to prevent the cut at B(r11). but it is not bad for white at the current stage as shown in the last variation, so it is only yose for black in gote.]
;B[rp];W[lq]LB[kn:A]C[it is unreasonable, because:
1. the lower-right black group is already alive, not of much value for white to attack it;
2. white's lower-right group is weak and needs to be reenforced first.

i prefer A(l6) instead.]
(;B[lp]C[if i were black, i will...

see variation please.];W[mp];B[mq]LB[nq:A][kp:B][lo:C][kn:D]
C[since white has atari at A(o3), B(l4) or C(m5), how about leaving as they are and jump out lightly with D(l6), aiming at B later?]
;W[lo];B[kp];W[ko];B[jp];W[lm]LB[in:A][hp:B]C[i think A(j6) is better to:
1. aim at B(h4) to make black's bottom territory smaller;
2. kill black's 43 and 49 stones in a large scale.

don't you think the space between white's 64 wall and 66 thickness is too narrow?]
;B[dk];W[lk]LB[in:A]C[now white's A(j6) has another good aim ---- to make black's 67 less valuable, besides the advantages mentioned above.

we can compare the all-board situation of the occupation of A between black and white.

see variation please.]
(;B[ed]LB[in:A]C[i still prefer A(j6) for black.];W[gc];B[ce]
;W[ec];B[dd];W[dc];B[bd]LB[fd:A]C[A(f16) first, which is key point for both's shapes.]
;W[cc];B[cg]LB[df:A][ci:B][cm:C][cq:D][ep:E]C[A(d14) is much stronger.
please compare with the variation 2 and 3.

the game coming to a phase, what shall white do next? let's judge the all-board situation first.

black:
upper-right: 7 points
lower-right: 30 points
thickness: left and lower-left
weakness: upper-right group

white:
upper-left: 10 points
right: 30 points
komi: 5.5 points
thickness: right and center
weakness: none

summary:  1. white aheads on territory by 8.5 points, but black's thickness has great potential to become territory.  2. black's moyo has invasion points at B(c11), C(c7), D(c3) and E(e4), which can not be reenforced with one move.
3. white's central thickness is too centralized and may not have a good development further more.
4. black's weakness is near to white's thickness.

from above, i have a plan (only suggestion).  see variation 4 please.]

(;W[eq]C[considering black's 7 strength, 78 is not a proper point.]

(;B[ep]C[how about...
  see variation please.];W[dq];B[dp];W[fq];B[fp]C[i prefer A(c3).]
;W[cq];B[in]LB[bq:A][bp:B]C[black's A and B combination is bigger, because of:
1. more territory;
2. making white more difficult to live in the corner.];W[bp]
;B[bo];W[bq];B[cn]C[white's lower-left corner is very big, which should have been black's.

let's judge the current situation, and then decide what white should do next.

black:
upper-right: 7 points
lower-right: 30 points
lower-left: 15 points
thickness: upper-left
weakness: upper-right group

white:
upper-left: 10 points
right: 30 points
lower-left: 11 points
komi: 5.5 points
thickness: right and center
weakness: none

white aheads on territory with 4.5 points.

i still perfer the variation at move 77, and repeat it again here for your convenience.

see variation please.]
(;W[di];B[ci];W[dj];B[cj];W[de]LB[ek:A]C[A(e9) is a forcing move.]

(;B[bf]C[see variation for black's alternative please.];W[ee]
;B[mf];W[og]LB[qc:A]C[black's 17 and 19 has little value to be survived out, A(r17) is the biggest.]
;B[id]LB[qd:A][qc:B]C[black should block at A(r16) to get the corner.

now what is white's proper answer to black's 99?
let's judge the situation first and then decide.

black:
upper-right: 8 points
lower-right: 30 points
left and lower-left: 29 points
weakness: none (because the upper-right group has been reenforced)

white:
upper-left: 12 points
right: 24 points (become fewer because of black's 85 and 97)
lower-left: 11 points
komi: 5.5 points
weakness: none

black aheads on territory with 14.5 points. black has more territory than white mainly because black's left moyo has turned into territory, but white has little exchange from that.   since white is short of territory, going into the corner with B(r17) become natural and necessary.

see variation please.]
(;W[gd];B[ek];W[hn]LB[gl:A]C[too deep, in danger.

how about A(g8) if white does want to play here, but the upper-right is still the biggest.]
;B[hm];W[io];B[ho];W[jo];B[gn];W[eh];B[qd]C[finally black gets it.

white has no chance to win from now on, short of territory and less thick.]

;W[qc];B[sc];W[lb];B[kb]LB[gl:A][hn:B][fd:C]C[white can not make alive in the upper-right corner after black's 109.

my overview of this game:

for white:
do not envy the potential of your rival's moyo to become territory and then invade into it deep. more often, the moves like 108 (to exchange black's 90) and A(g8) (instead of B(h6)) will be proved more practical and safer.

for both:
1. put more emphasis on the territory of corner (for example 84 and 120), it is much bigger than looks, and usually it is your group's base;
2. tell what is the key point for the shape (for example  C(f16)) or moyo (for example 85);
3. the goal of attack is not to kill, but make profits (for example, the battle in the right, attacker: white/attackee: black, and the battle in the lower-left, attacker: black/attackee: white).

the end.])
