C[Hi, Markus. 

It's me, HonFu! Isn't it funny that I get to review your game here? :-)

For people reading this: Markus was my opponent in my very first tournament game! So it's a nice opportunity for me to remember that time.

Markus also won that game back then, so I'm not sure if I can even tell him anything constructive here. ;-)

Okay, let's see what we've got here!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]

(;W[fg]C[Hon: I don't know so many josekis but this move here I haven't seen.]
(;B[bi]C[Hon: In the following sequence black just helps white getting more solid.]
;W[bh];B[ch];W[bj];B[di];W[cj];B[bg];W[ai];B[ei]C[Hon: This move looks very slow to me. But maybe it's honte, which is not my strong point. :-)]
;W[nd];B[pc];W[ld];B[mc]C[Hon: This peep looks strange to me. If it is supposed to be an attacking move, then it's clearly too early since K16 is still weak.]
;W[lc];B[md];W[me];B[nc];W[ke];B[oh];W[dr]C[Hon: White isolated K16 AND got D2. Looks good to me. But the right side is still weakish since white tenukied there.]
;B[fo];W[nj]C[We thought about S10 here but B would get a lot good moves on the outside here like N6 or O10.

Hon: Hard to tell (for me). Since I like territory (too) much, I'd probably played downwards (but I don't play Q10 myself for that reason). Black S10 looks annoying.]
;B[ql]C[Hon: But black wants more. :-)]
(;W[pm];B[qj]C[Hon: Ah, this was too easy for black.];W[pk]
;B[qk];W[mh]C[We thought that B leads here and should have played a safe reduction instead of the invasion.

Hon: I think black is not ahead on points. Even if we assume the bottom as black's territory, it looks still even. But it's black's move now.]
(;B[kg]C[Hon: I am not sure about this move. It DOES strike at a weak point.]
(;W[lf]C[Hon: If white has to defend here then black can probably treat this stone as a kikashi.]
(;B[ki]TR[hi][jj][ll][mm]C[Hon: Which would mean not clinging to it!

The group is still behind the moyo line, so black is invading. That might get dangerous.]
(;W[kk];B[hi];W[jh]C[W expected that B would protect the cut here but we both agree B's move was far better.]
;B[ig]C[Hon: Yes, playing lightly here is the right thing to do.]
(;W[kh];B[hf];W[ji]C[We thought about W G12 with the aim to either cutting in direction of g11 or enclosing the four stones instead of this one here. But W's plan was to defend calmly and capture K16 after B defended his group.

Hon: Defending yourself while aiming at the weakness of the opponent is usually the most reasonable way. As Manja Marz likes to say - "In a fight, leave the worries on the opponent's side."

White has also made profit here and repaired his weak spot at N11.]
(;B[id]LB[gh:A]C[We agree that linking up at F12 would have been better. From here on W tried to punish B's greed.

Hon: Black has just played a large endgame move (a territorial move) but has missed a large middle game move (defending a weak group).

Yes, now white can try to punish this. The problem is that it can be quite hard to successfully punish an overplay like this. 

From white's standpoint I would maybe start something at the bottom, aiming at A.]
;W[fi]C[Hon: If you start attacking like this directly you must have seen what this attack will get you. 

Clearly it will not create territory on the left. If you kill, perfect, but does it work? It would be good to get around the group, creating thickness and then destroying the bottom. But black comes out one step ahead here. 

I think in cases like these it's often better to just aim at the attack. If black still defends here later it will be gote zero points and you get two moves somewhere else.

But as the upper left looks like it has to play a defensive move, white later gets to surround the top group, so this became a success in the end.]
;B[hj];W[fj];B[bc]
(;W[hl]LB[ek:B][gk:A][il:C]C[We discussed about G9 here and came to the conclusion that G9 would have been better if W doesn't want to kill. However, W was confident to kill B's group here.

Hon: I can understand the feeling. :-)

But if you want to kill, you should play thickly. Black has too many moves to aim at here. Maybe it's possible to kill anyway, but white looks too thin to me.]

(;W[gc];B[jb];W[kb];B[ic];W[gb];B[ia];W[kp]C[We're unsure whether H3 would have been better here. But W tried to play something complicate here because it wants to make up for the lost fight above.

Hon: Yes, white has to destroy this territory, otherwise he can't win.]
;B[kq];W[jq];B[iq]
(;W[lq]C[Hon: Shapewise this should be bad. White must not allow the ponnuki. 

But if black takes there might be an ugly ko, so maybe it's good here.]

;W[cj];B[dg]LB[nc:B][dq:A]C[Hon: Now white has sente to play something like A or B.

I am not sure which is bigger. A is the final moyo entry point so territorially it looks urgent (black would want 3-3 now), but using the white strength breaking up black's moyo at the top right looks also urgent.

Since strength of groups is usually the most important factor for deciding the urgency of a fuseki or middle game move, I would probably play B.]
