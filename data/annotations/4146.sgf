C[TOBIAS: Hi sinvoon! I'm asked to do the review of your game. 
 Actually I'm just a 3kyu here at my club in the Netherlands so I'll try to keep my advices to something I CAN say... :-)]
;B[pp]C[TOBIAS: Wrong corner!!!

:-) just kidding...];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[dn]LB[fq:A]C[TOBIAS: I would realy like to know what was your idea behind this move. Why on the 4th line?
If youre planning to play San Ren Sei I would aproach from the direction of A.]
;W[fp];B[pj];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[dj]LB[dl:A]TR[dn]C[
TOBIAS: Up to now things are just ok except for the fact that all your stones are on the 4th line. 
Ok, its hard to say if this is right or wrong but I would prefer the triangled stone on the 3rd line cos of the weakness at A.]
;W[dh];B[fj];W[fn]C[TOBIAS: U see... white is playing with that weak point.]

(;B[co]LB[cl:A][cp:B]C[
TOBIAS: This move doesn't help much in my eyes cos white can still invade at A. If you want to give a base for your group B might be better (see the var) cos you will end up in sente.]
;W[cp]C[amy [-\]: very good for me
sinvoon [15k\]: oh..];B[fm]C[TOBIAS: Attaching here helps white again.]
;W[gm];B[em];W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[mq]LB[me:B][mo:A]
C[amy [-\]: this is early

TOBIAS: This is a HUGE mistake! 
You can not really expect to cut of the 2 white stones. 
If you want to get most out of the San Ren Sei you should play A or B.]
;W[mp];B[lp]C[sinvoon [15k\]: oh
amy [-\]: wrong cut direction];W[lq]
(;B[np]LB[mo:A]C[
amy [-\]: this doesn't do much
amy [-\]: but i value the center more than the bottom

TOBIAS: With this move you are forcing white to gain more influence in the center and thats exactly what you DON'T want.
If you atari now it should be at A (see the var)];W[mo];B[no]
;W[mn];B[hq]C[amy [-\]: this is very greedy
amy [-\]: it shouldn't live at all

TOBIAS: Verry BAD! 
You have a doubful future in Go if you can't stand to see your opponent get any territory.
When you requested a review for this game you asked what you have done wrong...
Moves like this and N3 are your main problem I guess.];W[fq]
;B[ho]
(;W[gn]C[amy [-\]: i give it to you anyway

TOBIAS: White is very kind here.
I guess white could have punished you a lot more  by playing at A (see var)]
;B[in];W[ec]C[amy [-\]: i take a huge point]
(;B[hc]LB[lc:A]C[
TOBIAS: Again too agressive. Actually you're helping the white group at the top right with it.
If you want to invade I would strike at A (see var)];W[jc]C[TOBIAS: U see?]

;B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[gg];B[ff];W[ci];B[ee]C[TOBIAS: Why giving atari here? You just make white stronger and you gain NOTHING!]
;W[df];B[de]C[TOBIAS: Why?];W[ce];B[cj];W[bj]
(;B[di]LB[bk:A]C[amy [-\]: leaving the left side open is poor

TOBIAS: Blocking at A is needed here.];W[bi];B[fe]C[TOBIAS: Connecting these stones is worth 4 points and nothing more. Far too small at this time.]
;W[jg];B[md];W[nd];B[me];W[mc];B[ke]LB[ne:A]C[TOBIAS: Again too agressive. A would be much better.]

C[amy [-\]: no
amy [-\]: you're playing simple and good
amy [-\]: very little overplay
amy [-\]: very little overplay is something i don't expect from a 15k at all
amy [-\]: capn overplays more than you are this game];B[iq]
;W[jp];B[hp]C[TOBIAS: Trying to get these stones out will hurt your framework at the right a lot.]

amy [-\]: this is the wrong direction
