C[I'm 6k, playing on Igs. I was playing black and won the game by 3.5 pts.
My question is on the direction of my moves, I need to known where were my big direction mistakes....
Are the 39, 51, 47, 85, 97 moves in the right place?
What are the moves that I left?
  Thanks to the reviewer of my game.

C[The usual idea for black is to play the two-space high pincer when he already has a stone at D10.]
;W[fq];B[dq];W[gp];B[fo]C[D5 would be a simpler alternative. This might be also ok if you know the variations ...]
;W[eo];B[fn]C[F2 is the correct continuation (see Ishida Yoshio, Dictionary of Basic Joseki, part 2, p. 14).]

C[This move is bad. According to Ishida (part 1, p. 135) you should play a counter-pincer at K16.]
;W[rf];B[rg];W[rh];B[re];W[sg]C[The pon-nuki is a major advantage for white.]
;B[qc];W[rd];B[rc];W[pd];B[od];W[pc];B[pb];W[se];B[nb]C[The cutting point at P15 is more important than the two stones in the corner.]
;W[pg]C[If white wants to play in this area, he should cut at P15. Another idea would be to play the kakari at O3, driving black against the white thickness. White is already strong on the right, so the value of this move is quite small.]
;B[qm]C[It is natural that you want to do something to eliminate white's thickness.]
;W[nq];B[oq]C[You should play at Q3 to secure the corner.];W[qk]
C[This is the wrong direction. O4 is much more important, and the corner is open anyway. This move makes only about 5 points!]
;B[np]C[Good.];W[mq];B[or];W[ip];B[cf]C[Good!];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc]
;B[ic]C[Once you exchange B16 for C17, you must add a stone at D12 or E14. Black can only afford the the wide extension C14-D10 due to the fact that he gets the invasion at C17 as compensation if white invades at C12. After this exchange, you won't get sufficient compensation, so you should defend.]

;B[ce];W[af];B[gj]C[This move does not look very urgent. Instead, you should play around K14 too take the initiative at the top.]
;W[co];B[do];W[dp];B[bp];W[en];B[dm];W[em];B[el];W[fl];B[ek]
;W[gm];B[db]C[This move is ok if you intend to attack white by robbing his base.]
;W[eb]
(;B[ec]C[You should cut at C18 and take the corner. Although this looks like being gote, you could look forward attackong the white stones.]
;W[ed];B[fb];W[dc];B[gb];W[da];B[ab];W[gd];B[ie];W[gf];B[me]
C[Wheter this is the right direction is hard to tell. It looks a bit like an overplay because you are pushing white against your weakness. However, the way white answered justified your move.]

(;W[le];B[lf];W[lg]C[Aji-keshi. After black secures the top, he has a slight lead and more potential to build further territory.]
