climm [1k\]: hi];B[qd]C[Hi reviewer, I play black in this game and I think I am doing ok at the beginning but during mid game.  I make some mistake.  Please point out

Hi, you play pretty well, but in the end of the midgame you lose quite alot of points from the fight in the bottom right corner which costs you the game]

;W[jc]LB[pj:A]C[Is this exchange ok for black?

This is regarded as standard play against white tenuki

A i think here is a good move, I would play here, but the coice you made was good as well. White playing A, after you play a shimari is expected, so you sould have a good idea what to do.]

LB[gi:A]C[is this ok for black?

I Think this exchange looks pretty solid, although i would definatly prefer to defend the cut with A istead. you have transformed your weak group to a source of strenght!]

;B[ch];W[bj];B[ed];W[ec]LB[fc:A]C[A is a possibillity here, but with some risk due to your two weak groups spit in the middle, so simply exstending might be the best idea.]

(;B[hi]LB[hd:A]C[is this needed?
This move is very good, but i prefer pushing once more at A. White hane there is pretty painful.]

(;W[pm]C[White expoits your weakness here, and it is pretty painful]
;B[pl];W[nm]LB[oo:A]C[It is quite difficult to find a good variation for black from this situaton. A might be a solution but it is quite submissive and there are many variations from here]

This split is your only hope, and due to your weakness in the top corner with the marked stone it will be more difficult]
