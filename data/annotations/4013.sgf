To the reviewer

I am Nikos and I am black. thank you so much for taking time
to review


Hi Nikos,

I'm Martijn. I found it an interesting game to review. I hope it will help you to improve. Please remember that I'm also a weak kyu player, so not everything I say may be correct and most variations I included just show a general idea, not the exact moves that should be played.]
;W[qp];B[qn]C[If black wants to approach the white stone, he should do so at P3 or P4. White can get a good result now by playing at one of those points.]
;W[dd];B[hq];W[qk];B[oq];W[po]C[I wanted to sacrifice r6];B[qh]
;W[pn];B[mc]C[This extension is too narrow, it doesn't stake out a large area and white can still invade the corner. K16 or K17 is better.]
;W[dj];B[dg];W[jd];B[ci];W[cj];B[di];W[cm];B[co];W[fq];B[eq]
;W[fr]C[White should run at F5 or something like that.]
(;B[er]C[Too submissive, black should play F4. See variation.]
;W[gp]
(;B[gq]C[This only strengthens white. Black should play J4 or J5 and try to get some territory while attacking. See variation for a possible result.]
;W[fp]C[It's better for white to connect at F5. That would make it easier to link up to the white stones at the left side and the forcing move black gets at E4 is almost worthless.]
;B[kq];W[qm]
(;B[kc]C[White gets more profit from this sequence than black. K18 would be better, but the four white stones at the bottom aren't safe. Black should attack them. See variation for a possibility.]
;W[jc];B[jb];W[ib];B[ka];W[hc]C[White is much stronger and black is overconcentrated.]
;B[cc]TR[dg][di][ci]C[I did not realise the bad outcome for me here

This move is a bit dangerous because the likely result is that black gaines the corner and white gaines strength which can be used against the marked black group.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb]
(;W[fb]C[Maybe white should play at F17. See variation.]
(;B[fc]C[I think this move is where it went wrong. See variation.]
;W[ed];B[gb];W[db];B[fa];W[cb];B[fd];W[fe];B[ge];W[gd]
(;B[hd]C[Black should play atari from the other side. See variation.]
;W[gc];B[hb];W[fb];B[ia];W[ea];B[ic];W[he];B[gf];W[id];B[ff]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[rc]
(;B[rd]C[Should be at Q18. See variation.];W[pc]C[This move should be at P18. Now black can kill.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[pa]
(;B[rb]C[Should be at T17. See variation.];W[sb];B[na];W[qb]
;B[ra];W[oa];B[sd]C[It's better to save moves such as this one for use as ko-threats.]
;W[sc];B[ee];W[od]
(;B[oe]C[It's better to just connect the black stone. See variation.]
;W[nc];B[nd];W[oc];B[mb]C[Those two stones aren't important. Black should play at N15 and prevent white from doing more damage.]
;W[ne];B[md];W[pe];B[qe];W[of];B[pf]
(;W[oe]C[White should punish black's move and play R14. See variation.]
;B[pg];W[pr];B[or];W[pq];B[gi]C[I wanted now to start for the center

I don't think it's possible to make much territory in the centre. Black should still attack the four white stones at the bottom.]
;W[bf]C[Good move, it takes territory and weakens the black group.]
;B[bg];W[ef];B[ko];W[is];B[gr]C[j1 worred me as I had never seen a play like that before

This move is called a monkey jump and there's nothing black can do to disconnect it.]
;W[gs];B[ir];W[hs];B[kr];W[op];B[mq];W[ep];B[cq];W[en]
(;B[im]C[by now I thought I had a real chance to kill whites bottom left stones

You should try to cut them. See variation.];W[de];B[bn];W[bm]
;B[eg];W[fg];B[gg];W[ei];B[fi];W[cf];B[cg];W[ej];B[gm];W[ip]
;B[iq];W[fm];B[gl];W[cn];B[bo];W[do];B[bj];W[eh];B[fh];W[jp]
C[White should jus defend and play B9.]
(;B[kp]C[The white move didn't threaten much. Black should play C9. See variation.]
;W[hp]C[Should be at B9.];B[ck]C[Good!];W[dk];B[cl];W[dl];B[bl]
C[A9 makes better shape. It would enable you to live at the side if it's necessary.]
;W[al];B[bk];W[am]C[I don't understand this move. White should play F8 or G6 to save the group.]
;B[fl]C[Good move. It will be hard for white now to get two eyes.]

(;W[mm]C[White should have tried to save his group and play K6. See variation]
;B[em]C[Good move, white's dead.];W[fn];B[el];W[dm];B[gn];W[jn]
;B[jo];W[in];B[io];W[ho];B[hn];W[kn];B[ln];W[jm]TR[mm]C[I should have done ladder here

The ladder is broken because of the marked white stone, but you could play a part of it. See variation in variation.]

(;B[km];W[jl];B[jk];W[il];B[ik];W[hm]C[White should have played L8, now black can capture white by playing there.]
;B[hl];W[kl];B[ll];W[lm];B[lk]C[Locally L9 is better. White caused a lot of trouble by playing there.]
;W[kk];B[kj];W[lj];B[li];W[jj];B[ki]TR[lk][ll]C[Why not capture the white stone. It would save the marked black stones which white can capture if he plays N10.]
;W[hk]TR[ik][jk]C[Black should save his two marked stones. White cannot capture the G8 group.]

(;B[gk]C[See variation.];W[ij];B[hj]C[Small, white can't cut anyway.]
;W[ik]C[White should not have answered.];B[mj]C[Good move, black gaines a lot of strength.]
;W[hi]C[Black should counter atari or something like that. See variation]

(;B[gj];W[hh]C[Black cannot get two eyes at the edge and as far as I can see black cannot escape either. I'm not sure if he can capture white, but I'm almost certain white cannot capture black.]
;B[ak]C[I don't think I need to say that this move isn't so good.]
;W[bi]C[I resigned here. but I wanted the start and middle game reviewed.

Good point to resign.
I don't know how long you thought about A9, but I'd like to advice you to think at least one or two seconds before making a move (unless you only have very little time). I've also made a lot of mistakes like this, they can cost a lot and all it takes to prevent them is just a few seconds.

Another thing you could improve is not making moves like 14 and 28. They strengthen the opponent and you get overconcentrated.

Try to read out simple situations like move 168. Reading out ladders correctly is also very important because they often occur. Sometimes they're difficult to read, but mistakes in reading them can be decisive.]
