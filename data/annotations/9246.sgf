C[The game is very straightforward, as black played very submissively. There's a few places where white could have done better, and I'll point out some places where I think black could have asked more of white.]

(;B[de]C[This and subsequent moves are terrible for black, as he only strengthens white positions and only gains a small enclosure in the middle.

Whie should expect black to play a splitting move, at which point white is forced to either solidify against an invasion, or approach from the side and make an invasion viable (see variations).]

C[Up until this move, this corner variation is joseki: black should aim to strengthen the corner in exchange for giving white a strong position along the right side.]
;W[qi];B[og];W[ph];B[oi]C[Black's two last moves are slowly, and only help white strengthen the right side. White is right in ignoring this and moving into the still exposed corner.]
