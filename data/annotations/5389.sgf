AB[pd][dp][pp]C[K- hi, I'm 'kester', playing black. Thanks in advance for looking at this game. I've gone through the game to note down my thoughts from the game. Please do point out anything I have missed, got wrong, or simply points you think I should think about.

This was a game where both of us made several mistakes. In my case I think I played strongly at first & the mistakes came in later when I began to lose concentration (the game took over 3 hours to play!).



* Hi kester. You played well (apart from the blunders in the endgame ;-) . I added my thoughts about this game and I hope it is useful. 
But of course, I often was not sure about the best move, so please feel free to doubt my comments :).
Malek]PL[W];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq];B[kp]TR[pj]C[K- I tend to prefer more territorial openings in even games, usually using 3-4 points rather than star points. But here I am trying to use my star points, in this case I am trying to use the pincer to make good use of the marked stone

* Good pincer.];W[cn];B[co]LB[cj:A]C[* This is a good move if Black has a stone around A. 
In the game, White is able to make good use of the C5-D6 exchange by making a three space extension.]
;W[dn];B[fq];W[dj];B[jc]C[* The biggest move.];W[qc]C[K- I was surprised by this, I thought white would play more for reduction than invasion in this area of the board

* I would not have played san-san here either.];B[qd];W[pc]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[nb];B[mc];W[qq]

(;B[pq]C[* I would prefer R4 because of the Q10 extension and the wall at the top. This would build a huge moyo.
But Q3 is okay, too.];W[qp];B[qo]LB[qr:A]TR[nq]C[* This hane is a mistake when White has the marked stone. But it is not easy to punish.
The correct move for White is A.]
(;W[ro];B[qn];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[rn];B[qm];W[nj];B[oh]
TR[lj]C[* This move is not necessary. It is not very effective to place more stones near your wall at the top.
Maybe M16 is better, to put some pressure on the white stone.
I guess P11 would be good, too.];W[mh];B[df]C[K- seemed like the biggest point on the board

* Yes, very big.];W[cf];B[cg];W[ce];B[eh]TR[mh][nj]C[K- aiming to reduce & run out, potentially leading to an attack on white's marked stones

* Seems to be a good idea.]
(;W[fc];B[np]C[K- I felt that pre-empting any trouble from this white stone was the biggest point]
;W[hp];B[iq];W[hq];B[ir];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[cl]C[K- white is building up influence in this area, I am trying to put a spike in it before it becomes solid

* This is a tough invasion, considering that the three stones above are not very strong.]
;W[bo];B[bp];W[do];B[cp];W[bj];B[el]
(;W[fn];B[fj]C[This looks good for black.];W[bg];B[ch];W[bh]
LB[ej:B][gl:A]C[* I don't think there is a standard move for this shape. A would be faster than B, but it would leave aji for White.]
;B[ej]TR[eh][fj][el]C[K- I suspect there is a standard move to reinforce the marked shape but I don't know what it is, so this is my attempt]
;W[jj]MA[kj]C[K- Curses, I was looking for a chance to play at x

* After Black has built thickness on the left, White really needs to support the two lonely stones.
If he did not play there, cutting the keima would be good alternative, too.]
;B[ii];W[ji];B[ih];W[jh];B[if];W[kn]C[The territory that Black has just build is not very big and it is still open. On the other hand, White got strengthened in the center.
I think this exchange was not optimal for Black.];B[lm];W[ln]
;B[nm];W[km];B[mk];W[mj];B[fe]LB[rm:B][hr:A]C[* Not the biggest point. 
A and B are very big.];W[rm]C[K- I had not yet found a chance to block this]
;B[qk];W[gl];B[nf]C[* O13 looks more effective.];W[lf];B[lg]
;W[kg];B[mg];W[lh];B[nh]C[K- I misread this, I thought it was sente]
;W[jf];B[ie];W[hj];B[gi];W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[mq];W[dk];B[fl]
TR[cl]MA[il][jl][hm][jm][gn][jn][ho][io]C[K- using the marked stone as bait so I could work my way into the marked area, which would otherwise be white territory

* Connecting the marked stone would have destroyed a lot of white territory, too. But of course after D9 it was not possible anymore, so F8 was correct.]
;W[dl];B[gk];W[hk];B[gm];W[hl];B[fm];W[hi];B[hh];W[gj];B[fh]
;W[lk];B[nk];W[sj]C[K- unfortunate but not unexpected];B[rj]
;W[sk];B[sl];W[rl];B[si];W[rk];B[ri];W[no];B[op];W[os]C[K- mistake by white]
;B[ns];W[ps];B[mo];W[mn];B[lo];W[nn];B[om];W[ib];B[ec]C[* Good.]

;W[ni]C[K- mistake by white];B[li];W[kh];B[oj];W[mf];B[ng];W[md]
;B[ne];W[lb];B[ke]C[K- I did not expect to prevent white's connection so perhaps should not have played out this sequence]
;W[je];B[jd];W[kd];B[me];W[le];B[bn];W[bm];B[ao];W[hr];B[fr]
;W[bl];B[gp];W[go];B[gq];W[io];B[ij]C[K- slack move by black, and costly]
;W[jr];B[jq];W[is];B[kr];W[ef]C[K- I know should have covered this weakness but did not find the chance so far]

;B[es];W[gs];B[eo]TR[kn][io]MA[en][gn]C[K- I didn't notice that white could connect the triangle stones, so thought I would get the 2 stones when white connected at x]
;W[fo];B[en];W[dr]C[K- uh oh];B[dq];W[er];B[cr];W[ds];B[cs]

[jr][lr][mr][nr][as][bs][ks][ls][ms]C[K- I have played this opponent many times and I think on this occasion he made more mistakes than I would expect, and early on I exploited them ok I thought. Later on I started making mistakes & he got stronger, but I did manage to stay ahead just.

* You played very well in the beginning and did not make one big mistake. I hope my review was helpful, though.]
