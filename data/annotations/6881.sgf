RE[W+Resign]

C[Jswong84 [12k\]: hi
chi963 [12k\]: hi];B[pc]C[Firstly i want to thank the person reviewing this game, im playing as White, i starting Go for abt 2.5 months now and this is the 1st game i asked to be reviewed. I beileve there is alot to improve in this game and i won because of black mistakes. As this is my 1st game being review i might have added too much comment. Secondly, i have pointed out some of my mistake that i saw after relooking at my game, hopefully it will not offense you that i marked them. I still not use to playing with less den 25min think time so alot of mistake was made.

Dmitry: Hello, my name is Dmitry, I'll review your game.];W[pp]
;B[cd];W[cp];B[ec];W[qm]LB[ip:A][iq:B][qn:C]C[Dmitry: Possible, but little bit too far. Good moves here are: A or B (chinese fuseki) for developing on bottom side. Locally I prefer closer move at C.]
;B[qe]LB[jd:A]C[Dmitry: Good move, Black has two corners now. Next Black move should be at A.]
;W[nq]LB[ep:B][eq:A][ip:D][iq:C]C[i beileve this is a normal start, but i was thinking should i have expand on the left or invade into the top?
Dmitry: Corners->sides->center - it is normal flow of the game. Hoshi point is not for making territory immediately, but for influense, so here I prefer to play at A or B (to stabilize corner), or C or D move (chinese fuseki)]
;B[qq]LB[dj:B][jd:A]C[Dmitry: Too early. There are a lot of big points on the board, like A or B. Even if Black will live here, White will gain huge outward influence.]
;W[qp];B[rp];W[ro]
(;B[rq]LB[rr:A]C[Dmitry: Bad, should be A, see variation.]
(;W[pq]MA[pr]C[i beileve Q2 is the proper move to kill here is there anyway to escape (black) if i played Q2? i have pointed another mistake that i beileve its a sure kill but not sure if its possible to escape, could you help see if i was wrong?
Dmitry: see variation.];B[pr];W[or];B[qs];W[sp];B[rr];W[os]
C[Dmitry: Sente of course, but too slow. Good idea is to save moves like that as ko-threat.]
;B[ps]C[even tho i lost the corner im still quite happy with the shape of my seed, should i really be happy? sorry if the question seem silly for a 12k player.]
;W[jp]LB[ip:A]C[Dmitry: Good, but too close to White's wall. A is better.]
;B[eq];W[gq];B[do];W[co];B[dp];W[cm]
(;B[iq]TR[eq][do][dp]C[Dmitry: As for me better is to stabilize marked stones. See variation.]
;W[ip];B[jq]C[Dmitry: Bad idea. Now Black has two weak groups in White's zone.]
;W[kq];B[hq];W[gp];B[ho]C[Dmitry: Strange move.];W[hp];B[gr]
;W[fr];B[hs];W[fq];B[kr]C[At this point i beileve F1 at this moment is too early
Dmitry: F1 is sente for Black];W[jr];B[kp];W[lq];B[js]MA[ir]
C[The next move should have been J2 once again mistake here should be a sure kill here too.
Dmitry: Should be J2 of course.];W[ko];B[ir];W[lp]TR[eq][do]
[dp]C[Dmitry: Too slow, there are no need to take this stone immediately and shicho is good for you. Better is to attack marked stones, for example at E7 or D6.]
;B[er];W[fs];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[br];B[fp];W[fo];B[ep];W[fn]
;B[em];W[dn];B[en];W[eo];B[go];W[gm];B[bn];W[cn];B[bm]MA[bk]
C[whats the correct respone to this move should i knight to B9? i was thinking that will result in black forming influnce towards mid if i go to B9, therefore i picked C9 instead since most of the players i played with does that.
Dmitry: I prefer to push at C8 here. This is very good for White to build big third line wall.]
;W[ck];B[bl]TR[fp][do][dp][ep][eq][er][cq][cr]MA[bk]C[another mistake by me should have been B9
Dmitry: C8 is ok. Black marked stones are still dead, but possible troubles after cut at C8 give Black a chance to save his dead marked stones.]
;W[cl];B[bk];W[bj]C[Dmitry: Why??? Now Black could cut at C10. Why don't just C11  or C10?]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[cj];W[el]MA[fl]C[So many mistake i made after i relook at my game. F8 will trap that 2 stone]
;B[fm];W[gn];B[fl];W[cs]MA[ek]C[i realise i didn't need to waste my sente here as the group is aready dead, would have played E9 instead for safety. Not sure whats the best move at this moment

Dmitry: E9 is natural here.];B[ds];W[bs];B[dl];W[ek];B[gl];W[hn]
;B[dk];W[dj];B[ci];W[dm];B[bi]C[Local fight wouldn't get me any pt now so i decide to invade for some pt, once again im not sure where the best place to invade at or should i have expand my land along the 7th line.]
;W[jc]C[Dmitry: Good, but K16 is more flexible imho. Low (third line) stones in invasion are good for building life, high (fourth line) stones are good for running out]
;B[hc]C[Dmitry: Good direction. Upper left is bigger.];W[mc]
;B[qi]
(;W[pg]TR[jc][mc]C[after looking at this i was thinking this is a very weak move from me, wat would a better move be?
Dmitry: Here you need to stabilize marked stones, which are weak so far. See var.]
;B[di]C[i beileve he was trying to build up his moyo for the corner at this moment.]
;W[ei];B[dk];W[dl];B[fk]C[but instead i have no idea wats he doing so i played by instinct for the next 4 moves]
;W[fj];B[gj];W[gi];B[hm];W[in];B[im];W[jm];B[hk]C[i spend 3 min thinking here but sadly didn't see the weak point at K6]
;W[hj];B[jn]C[and this move i know he escaped and lose my conceration for the next few moves]
;W[io];B[jl]
(;W[il]C[Dmitry: Why don't just L7? See var.
This local fight is not urgent for White (all your groups are safe). Here I prefer attack upper left side.]
;B[km];W[gk];B[hl];W[ik];B[ij]MA[jm]C[here i was so determind that he had escape and did not see this move could have seal the game here, (makes u wonder how both black and me are 12k right)
Dmitry: Even pro players sometimes make one-move-mistakes...;)]
;W[jk];B[kk];W[jj];B[kn];W[ii]MA[jm]C[6 move and still no one saw that...]
;B[gj];W[ll];B[kl];W[ln];B[lm];W[mn];B[mm];W[nm];B[mk];W[nl]
;B[ml];W[lk]C[Dmitry: Bad idea, still better move is at E13 or E15.]
;B[kj]C[Dmitry: Should be M10.];W[lj];B[li];W[mj];B[ji];W[ij]
;B[ih];W[hi];B[jh]TR[lj]MA[ni]C[should i escaped or give up this 4 stone at this point of the game?
Dmitry: In most cases it isn't good idea to run away with small groups like that - chance to save is poor, and opponent during attacking your stones makes strong position. Sacrifice these stones and make profit - this is good strategy. See var.]

(;B[qa];W[pa]TR[fp][ds][do][dp][ep][eq][er][cq][cr]C[Jswong84 [12k\]: thx
chi963 [12k\]: thanks

I beileve i have played quite poor in this game, if black didn't make the mistake and lost the corner i would have lost. Once again thank you for review this game.

Dmitry: I'm not sure about geme result if Black could save his corner. Try to count points carefully. Now the game is almost equal, remember, that marked black stones are dead. So white should make something in upper left to win.

Play a lot of no_fast games, look at the whole board, remember proper order of steps - "first stabilize your group, next attack" and your will improve! Good luck!]
