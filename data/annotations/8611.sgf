C[h.: Hello!

I would be grateful if this game was reviewed.

First, I need to know how not to put myself into such positions as to having to pull myself out by my own hair (metaphorically; through enemy mistakes and too many ko fights in the game).

Second, the thing which always confuses me is what to do when the opponent does not follow the joseki, but does so without blatant errors. Any tips, applied to the match or otherwise, would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance.

Hi, I'm Sisyph, I will be your reviewer for this game. I will do my best to give you useful advices, focusing on joseki and fundamentals on how not to set yourself in a messy position ^^ 

I'm currently 6kyu on kgs, keep that in mind when reading my comments.

My comments start with some dashes. I use Japanese Go terms a lot, if you don't know them, go to http://senseis.xmp.net/?JapaneseGoTerms

Let's Go !];B[pp];W[qd];B[do];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[dd];W[cd]
;B[df]LB[ec:A]C[h.: The first deviation. Should have been E17. Would I have been better off if I had played at E17 (or maybe E16?) instead of ignoring this faux pas?

----------
Yes, the joseki move is at E17 (A). Any other move is not even considered by joseki books ^^
It must be a very bad move. See variation for my humble opinion.


To answer your question on how to handle joseki, one of the best advice given to me is not to be too eager to learn and follow joseki ! Why ?

Because you have to keep in mind that :

- joseki are sequences that professional players agreed upon to say that they are somehow equals considering territory, influence, sente and aji ! (many complex things to getright)

- there is LOTS of them, MANY variations, pros regularly find new joseki and some old joseki are not considered joseki anymore !

- joseki are LOCAL sequences, and a joseki move can be the WORST move to make given the global position. A joseki must be chosen to fit the global position.

As an amateur player it is hard to grasp really all of that. All this to come to a great advice :

Do not LEARN joseki, STUDY them. That's mean you have to UNDERSTAND every move, why it is played, how to gain advantage of an opponent mistake, etc. This way you will not only learn a joseki, but become really good at close com at, at tesuji (joseki are full of them) and you will naturally handle your opponent mistakes ^^

A good book to start with is "38 basic joseki" : http://senseis.xmp.net/?38BasicJoseki

Kogo's dictionnary is freely available at http://eidogo.com

But remember : try to really understand the moves in joseki. Play variations on the goban. In this case, other move than A is not possible in the mind of pro players writing books. You have to find for yourself why !]
(;W[cf]C[----------
This move is not as good as E17 as we have seen.];B[ec]C[----------
Here, you are back to the joseki];W[dg]C[----------
And here, you begin the complex o-nadare joseki (big avalanche)]
;B[cc];W[db]
(;B[cb]LB[bc:A]C[h.: The second deviation. What am I to do?

----------
Yes, the joseki move is B17 (A). 

To handle a  deviation, you can ask yourself why the joseki move is at A and what is the difference with the actual move (of course you have to know the joseki and why the joseki move is here and not there). You can also look at the position and find the right move for yourself ^^

You see that Black C18 group has only 3 liberties (compared to 4 if Black has played A, this move is somehow damezumari). Of course, WhiteD18 group has only 2 with this move, and Black threaten E18, from this point of view it is OK. But, Black is to weak to force White playing E18 ...]
(;W[ed]C[----------
Yes this is the weakness. But you played it too soon. Black E18 win the day ! In any case play E18 first ! See previous variation for explanations.]
;B[ee]
(;W[bc]C[----------
No ! E18 ! Black gave you another chance !];B[eb]C[h.: Possibly the third deviation. If the joseki had been followed, the correct move would have been at F16. Now I am completely at loss. Especially considering that such a situation could have arised even with the normal flow, but I still wouldn't have known how to react.

---------
Not really a deviation, there no joseki anymore ^^

E18 ends your hopes. Black is now leading as the influence he gains is facing your R16 stone. But there is some aji in E16, so ... Anyway as you know amateurs make mistakes all the way to the end so, nothings is lost ^^]
(;W[fd]C[----------
Hum, probably not the best way to exploit the aji of this stone. As you can not really attack black now, it seems better to get sente to play a big move before exploiting this stone aji.

Remember :

FIRST: save / stabilize / reinforce your weak groups

SECOND: Attack enemy's weak group to gain something

THIRD: play big points

If you can play a move that do more than one thing, play it first ^^
And of course, keep sente if possible !

Here, 

- your C16 group is kind of OK, because of the forcing move at B18, space to make eyes, you probably can consider it safe for now.

- after E18, black is strong and can not really be attacked, you can exploit aji around it later

- there is a lot of big points to take ^^

So Instead of F16, I will play one of the big points along the sides or make a kakari against black corners. 

If you want to exploit the aji, it is generally better to threaten to play F16. A play like E13 maybe. See some ideas in variations.]
;B[bb];W[bd];B[fe];W[gc]
(;B[cm]C[h.: I suppose my F16 group could have been attacked and probably killed? If so, how would you have gone about that? And how could I have prevented that?

----------
You can have been killed. You can have prevented it by not playing F16 directly ^^

Remember, play away from strength !

Black decides not to exploit you weak group, and his move is not that good as you can invade under his stones... You have your chances ^^]
(;W[oc]C[---------
Ok, you get some territory. better than black last move, so ok. Maybe invading right now is  better, because if black play D3, invasion is impossible and black start to build a moyo, on the other hand you have the perfect extension to play around R10 to match black D3 ...]
(;B[fp]C[--------
I think you can invade. Black D3 is probably better to secure some points.]
(;W[qj]C[--------
Good extension];B[ch];W[cg];B[di];W[dk]C[----------
Remember to secure your groups BEFORE attacking. Attacking from weak group is generally a bad idea ^^ Black will attack the invading stone to build his group and then go back attacking your weak group ^^]
;B[bh]
(;W[bg]C[h.: Here I understood that my group was not alive, but counted on escaping towards the centre should it be attacked. Was that too optimistic?

--------
Escape to the center before ! You have only one eye, if black seals you, you are dead !]
;B[fj]C[---------
Black decide to attack your invading stone]
(;W[ej]C[---------
It is usualy better to cut the other way. You have to read. See variations.]
;B[ei];W[fk];B[dj];W[ek];B[gj]C[---------
Not really good for white :

;W[fn]
(;B[fo]C[----------
Avoid contact move to attack. Black is kind with you. See variations.]
;W[gn];B[gk];W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[kq]C[h.: Once again the joseki gets rather liberal treatment, but I imagine that this is not a mistake, not of consequence, at least.]
;W[qq]
(;B[ko]C[----------
Too soft, see variations ...];W[jm]C[h.: The move I have severe doubts about. What should I have done?]
(;B[in];W[hm];B[im];W[il];B[hl];W[gl];B[hk];W[dn];B[cn];W[dm]
;B[cl];W[hn];B[jn]C[h.: This stone seems rather unnecessary. It was an opportunity for me to live unconditionally (F7, perhaps?), but I did not foresee the actual attack. I imagined that it would be F8 which I could have turned into a ko (and most certainly would have lost it for the want of a threat).

----------
Yes black should have killed you. And you should have lived after K6 ^^]
(;W[ge]C[-----------
Yes, but your E10 group is dead ^^ You should save it first if possible.]

You have connected, but Black is ahead.
A pity that he has lost sente for only 8 points ^^
You have to use it to come back in the game]

I prefer R8 to attack black, because it strengthen your R10 stone too.]

;W[pj];B[om];W[nl];B[qm];W[ef];B[dc];W[gg]C[h.: Was this too small? My notion was that the cut at E13 would be disastrous.

----------
NO !!! IT IS ABSOLUTLY NECESSARY !!!!

Remember : Save / stabilize / reinforce your weak group first. This is probably the winning move ^^ Until the next mistake ;-)

(;W[ml]C[h.: I oscillated between N8 and M8. Actually, there was little calculation involved in the final desicion. This option just seemed firmer.

C[h.: Obviously, it should have been O13 (2 points difference, right?), but that did not matter anymore.

---------
Yes, after killing the black lower left group, the game was over. 

To sum things up :

- Study joseky to understand them in order to handle deviation. You will get stronger at fights.

- remember to strengthen your groups before attacking weak groups, before getting big points. Protecting a weak group is not a slack move !

- do not count on your opponent mistake. You can hope and exploit them, but do not play elsewhere praying for your opponent being blind.

You were lucky, but I read that until about 3-4 kyu, the game can change anytime because of mistakes. Thrive for getting to this level ^^

And remember : Play and enjoy Go ! that the best thing to do ^^

And Merry Christmas !])

This is where black should have played to follow the standard joseki. As a Go proverbs says :

"The enemy's key point is yours"

Seeing this position I think I know why Black can not afford to play anything than E17, as if White play there, he clearly gain the lead, no ?

In my humble opinion :

- White has a big corner (the cut at A do not work as far as I know, see variation)

- White start to build a framework with the two triangle stones

- Black gains little in compensation (little influence, not a really good shape, he has to add some move like C14 to match White framework on the top)]

Probably the best move for Black now, coherent with his previous move. But white has the corner, sente and it seems that the aji of the A cut is not that worth.]

Hum, I prefer E17. Here you give Black possibilities for complications. The firmer E17 is better in my opinion.]
