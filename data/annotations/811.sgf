AB[pd][dp][dd];W[pp];B[qj];W[fd]C[Very unusual.  Usually reserved for special circumstances such as when there is an excellent chance of territory along the side.  This move cannot connect to the 3-3 point is an invasion is made so it pretty much precludes the possibility of a later W invasion of the corner.]
;B[df]
(;W[kc]LB[jc:a][dc:b]C[Too wide.  Should hold back to 'a'.  The joseki is to attach at 'b' - see variation.]
;B[nc]LB[mc:a][ic:b]C[Much better at 'a'.  The move played does not threaten an invasion at the top as strongly as would 'a'.  The reason is that, after 'a', an invasion at 'b' cannot be stopped from connecting to 'a' (or escaping easily), but this is not true of B6.  W would probably have to defend if B played at 'a', thus showing that W5 was an overextension.]

(;W[ck]LB[dc:a]C[Best to get in 'a' before B invades the top.  See variation.]
;B[ci]LB[fc:a][gc:b][ec:c][gd:d]C[Given that B has played at 6 and made an invasion at the top less effective it would be better for him to exchange 'a' thru 'd' and then play at 8.  This would pretty much secure 30 pts of territory at the top left.]
;W[cn];B[co];W[fq];B[eq]LB[dn:a][cm:b][ip:c]C[This move doesn't make sense.  B should be aiming to pincer this stone.  Exchange 'a' for 'b' and then pincer at 'c'.]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[cm];B[dm]LB[jp:a]C[This has little effect on W.  In fact it just helps him make good shape.  It is a heavy move which only fills in B's liberties.  A pincer at 'a' looks more effective.  With such a pincer in place W is reluctant to play at 16 himself and force B to seal in the 2 W stones from above.]
;W[dl]C[A perfect hane for W];B[el]LB[ek:a][fm:b]C[This is a bad move as it does very little for B.  It let's W make the nice shape move of 'a' while still leaving a cutting point for B. Jumping out at 'b' would be better.]
;W[ek];B[fl];W[cg]LB[dg:a]C[Premature.  W has too many weak stones on the board for this invasion. Look at the variation starting with B 'a'.]

(;B[dg];W[ch];B[dh]LB[di:a]C[As the variation shows this must be at 'a']
;W[cc]LB[bi:a]C[Another premature invasion.  W has even more weak stones than before. B can answer at 'a' (among other things) and get a good enough result.]
;B[dc];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[cd]LB[ec:a][fc:b][bc:c][bb:d][bi:e]
C[This move contradicts B28.  After playing 28 B must connect at 'a' or 'b'.  If B30 is going to be played then 28 must be omitted so that 'c' is an atari after W plays 'd'.  However, because W can play at 'e' to connect, blocking on the left is wrong.  B must block at the top and pan on invading the W extension.]
;W[fb];B[fc];W[ea];B[ec];W[gb];B[bi]LB[gc:a]C[Undoubtedly big, but it is a pity to let W get 'a'.  However, the potential attack on the W stones below makes it worth it, but it B does not get an attack then this move must be consisdered questionable becasue it would then be gote with no other followup.  A move at 'a' not only is big, but has a lot of potential for expansion.]
;W[gc]
(;B[gd]LB[hd:a][fk:b]C[Pointless.  All this does is help W.  W can atari at 'a' to build strength and territory while at the asme time forcing B into an overconcentrated shape.  The B group is save and so there is no need to play in this way.  Each play must find moves which restrict the opponent while expanding their own potential.  The correct move here is show in the variation starting at 'b'.]
;W[qm]LB[hd:a]C['a' is essential.  This is a pivotal point for both players and neither can concede it.  B cannot ignore 'a'.]
;B[dj]LB[fk:a]C['a' is correct as shown in the earler variation.]
;W[dk];B[kq]LB[gj:a][ip:b][jp:c]C[B still has a good chance to kill by playing 'a'.  Also, the correct pincer is at 'b'. W can counter this pincer with 'c' and B is on the defensive.]
;W[iq]LB[jp:a][ko:b]C['a' is better.  After this move B can play 'c' and W is confined.]
;B[nq]LB[ko:a]C['a' is better as it confines W and kill B more room to manouver.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[on]LB[pn:a]C[No good.  It leave too many weakness in the corner to be exploited.  W cannot attack too strongly because of his weak stones to the left and so it is better to strength the corner first.  'a' is better.]
;B[qg]LB[ko:a][io:b][gj:c]C[B cannot leave the bottom.  The first player there has the initiative.  The 3 B stones and 3 W stones are symmetrical and snete in such a situation is essential.  Because W left a weaknessin the corner by playing W47, B can just jump to 'a' in anticipation of Wb.  B still has the severe move at 'c' to play.]
;W[ne]LB[hd:a][gj:b][pf:c]C[I don't understand this move at all.  Is it trying to build central thickness?  If so then it is easily refuted by B plays at 'a' and 'b' amongst others.  This just forces B to play at 'c' or thereabouts and secure over 30 pts.  If W is going to play in this quadrant then a 3- 3invasion is the only move.]
;B[md]LB[pf:a][hd:b]C[This serves no purpose.  B should just take his territory by playing at 'a' with a big smile.  This move is not worth that much becuase W has no territory here (because  50 and 'b' are miai)  If he is trying to capture this stone then this also is unrealistic.]
;W[fe]LB[hd:a]C[Given the weakness below this move is an overplay.  Better to just give B his small territoy by playing at 'a'.  However there are more important area, such as settling  the lone W stone, or getting te first move in at the bottom.]
;B[kd]LB[hd:a]C[Certainly a nice shape move but since W49 is not easy to capture, perhaps B should settle for 'a']
;W[hd];B[jc]LB[mm:a]C[A nice move but this is an excellent oportunity to take the initiative at the bottom.  'a' is a ladder breaker and so , by playing this point, B can get two moves in a row at the bottom and but severe pressure on W.]
;W[fk];B[gl];W[gk]LB[mm:a]C[These W moves onlt serve to isolate the 3 stones below.  In view of the ladder breaker at 'a' this is a very dangerous tactic.]
;B[er]LB[hl:a]C[This could be the losing move.  If B keep moving out at 'a' the three stones below are in big trouble.]
;W[fr]LB[hl:a]C[Let's B off the hook.  Must be a double hane at 'a']
;B[fn];W[bd]C[Sente, but incidental to the game.  This move is best left as a ko threat.]
;B[be];W[ac];B[cf];W[eo];B[fo]LB[dq:a]C[Just connect.  B must connect anyway so why give W a cutting point at 'a' to aim at.]
;W[ep];B[do];W[hl];B[cq]LB[hm:a][hn:b]C[The corner is not in immediate danger, (although B must be careful). 'a' or 'b' is essential]
;W[hk]LB[ik:a][in:b]C[Why this.  At least play 'a' if W is going to connect.  Atfter 'a' W can play 'b' without threat of being cut.]
;B[hn];W[kp];B[lq];W[jp];B[lp]LB[mn:a][mm:b]C[Normally 'a' would be considered better shape.  Because of the ladder breaker 'b' is probably better here.  In either case the aim is to cut the W stone off and get out at the same time.]
;W[ln];B[mr]C[Nice shape - ensures life.];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
;B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[sd]LB[qf:a][pb:b]C[This does not help B.  Either play 'a' or 'b' depeding on whether you think you can kill W or not.  The life and death of the W stones is a problematic issue as it depends on the strength of the players.  Certainly, after 'b' W must cut and hope to capture some B stones.]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[qf];B[pf]C[Giving in so easily  cannot possibliy be right.  B must atari from below and fight it out.  This move makes B86 totally wasted]

[oi:e][ki:f]C[B must fight back with Ba, W116, Bb, Wc, Bd, We Bfand hope he. Can cancel out W's center.  Chances are not good, but he loses without it.]
;W[mi];B[kh];W[lg];B[mf]C[Exchanging B118 for W119 loses 2 pts in gote]
;W[hh];B[qq];W[or];B[qr]LB[ro:a]C[B must play at 'a' threatening to connect out or try to live.  However, living will not be easy.  If he cannot live then the invasion is wrong and he should have settled for B123 in sente.]
;W[rp]LB[ro:a][nr:b][ps:c]C[Mistake.  Gives B a cahnce. Better at 'a'  (don't forget that 'b' is sente again the B stones to the left So B cannot threaten to connect out this 'c']
;B[qp];W[qo];B[po];W[oo];B[ro]LB[op:a][pq:b]C[Better to play 'a' firs tand see how W responds. If W connects at 'b' in response to 'a' he is filling his own liberties and that might help B gain a point or two later.]
