;B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[qd]C[I am suspect of w's 4. B's stone on
the star point would love to extend along the top and hem white along the right
side.];B[dj];W[oq]C[Given b's sarensei on the left, w6 feels very small.
Completing the corner enclosure above is likely better.];B[qf]
C[B7 takes the
power out of w's stone. W wants to develop along the right edge.]
;W[od]C[With
the complete enclosure, w can choose to extend along the top or right. But b has
the initiative.];B[qi];W[qk]C[When w blocks here, b wants to stablize by moving toward the bottom and
then grab territory along the top.];B[pm];W[fq];B[qo]C[W12 leaves the lone stone
on the right stranded as b builds up to grab territory on the right. Now w's
investment on the right is wasted.];W[qp];B[ro];W[cn];B[co]
;W[dn];B[eq];W[eo];B[ep];W[fp];B[jp]C[B23 lightly erases the w influence on the bottom. B
could build territory here or merely run to connect to a live group on top or
the right.];W[lp];B[pk]C[B finishes sketching in big territory on the right. If
w24 two points left of the stone on the right, b's two groups on the right would
look thin. Now they appear solid.];W[jc];B[mc]C[W 26 was too wide, allowing b's
invasion with 27];W[md];B[pc];W[pd]C[The corner enclosure and top extension were meant to build territory for
w. Now b has cut deeply in
them.];B[oc];W[qb];B[qc];W[rc];B[nd];W[ne];B[nc];W[gc]C[W38 seems to be moving
away from the fight. W could use the single stone on the right as leverage to
attack the two b stones below the right corner. Perhaps a hane to the right star
point to cut b at the waist. That could lead to an attack on the lower half of
b's group as well....];B[ec];W[dg];B[ld];W[me];B[kc];W[lb]C[This seems a foolish move.]
;B[kb]C[B cuts off
the stone and threatens the stones to the left.];W[jb];B[la]
;W[ma];B[ka]C[And
now makes eye-shape with w's help. And the stones to the left as still under
threat with b "below" them on the edge.];W[jn];B[kr];W[kd];B[le]
C[W52 succeeds only in flushing b into the center where
b can grab territory and threaten to squeeze w stones between solid
groups.];W[mg];B[jd];W[ke];B[lf];W[kf];B[mf];W[nf];B[lg];W[mh]
;B[kh]C[B moves to encircle the three w stones.];W[fg];B[hg]
C[
B uses the opportunity to encircle the w stones and cap w's
extension.];W[fe];B[ie]C[The encirclement is complete and b is
secure.];W[fj];B[cf]C[B secures plenty of territory in the corner.]
;W[cg];B[df];W[ef];B[eh];W[eg];B[fh];W[gh];B[dh];W[ci];B[ej]
;W[gi];B[cj];W[bj];B[bk];W[bh];B[fk];W[bl];B[cl];W[dk]C[Another move (like 44)
meant to remove eyes but ends up being captured to give one. W needs to see that
capturing w86 will also give an eye. B also has an atari threat to give an eye
out of his bamboo extension.];B[dl];W[gk];B[fl]C[B makes good shape and can get eyes at e11, d9, and/or b8. Needs
only 2 of these three.];W[em];B[fm];W[gn];B[fn];W[fo];B[gm]
;W[hm];B[hp];W[ho];B[gq];W[fr];B[er];W[es];B[ds];W[fs];B[cr]
;W[hr];B[ir];W[lr];B[ko];W[ln]C[W's net here cannot hold its quarry because it has too many
threats against it.];B[kq];W[iq]C[W's move here should be m2, preventing b from
extending right.];B[jr]C[B is nice enough to connect here giving w another shot
at the more correct move.];W[ip];B[io];W[in];B[jo];W[hq];B[lq]
C[Now we see why m2 was
needed.];W[mr];B[mq];W[nr];B[kn];W[km];B[lo];W[mp];B[mo];W[mm]
;B[nn]C[And b escapes the net, connecting to live stones on the
right.];W[np];B[oo];W[no];B[mn];W[om];B[on];W[po];B[pn];W[rp]
;B[so];W[qn]C[W mis-reads the ladder.];B[qm];W[pl]C[And offers a double-
atari to b.];B[ol];W[nm];B[ql];W[mj];B[nl];W[ml];B[oh];W[nk]
C[W ignores an important threat here.];B[ng];W[og];B[nh];W[mi]
;B[pb];W[pa];B[oa];W[rb];B[re]C[Now w's corner comes under attack.]
;W[rd];B[se];W[qa];B[sd]C[B's
move here is unnecessary. W cannot live with bent 4 in the corner. Better to
attack the rest of the group putting the four stones and one stone to the left
in atari.];W[sc];B[sa];W[na];B[ob]C[B loses the fight here. B need not connect
as this will not give w a second eye and the b group could connect out to where
b has securely encircled three stones.

If b plays p14, q13, or q12 here instead, b will capture the white corner.]
;W[pf];B[of];W[oe];B[qe];W[ph];B[oi];W[pi];B[qh]C[B sees the folly now and saves
the stones at the top of the right group. Sacrificing 4 stones to keep 5 and
about 8 points of territory.];W[oj];B[pj];W[ni];B[bm];W[bn]
;B[bo];W[an];B[ao];W[am];B[al];W[cm];B[fi];W[gj];B[di];W[bl]
;B[ck];W[ak];B[el]C[B finishes getting two out of three
eyes.];W[gl];B[ch];W[bi];B[lm];W[ll];B[kj]C[B moves to erase any hope of big w territory in the
center.];W[bf];B[cd];W[bd];B[bc];W[be];B[cc];W[eb];B[db];W[fc]
C[This move invites the b hane. Better it was one line
higher.];B[fb];W[gb];B[ea];W[ga];B[ic];W[ib];B[hc];W[hd];B[id]
;W[he]C[W struggles to connect because of the threat of b on the 19th
line.];B[hb]C[B sets up the snap-back...];W[ha];B[ia];W[ja]
C[This is a wasted
move. It would make a decent ko-threat later.];B[ia];W[if];B[hf]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[jg];B[kg]C[A second snap-back...];W[hh]C[...but this one w sees and does not
waste.];B[ji];W[ih];B[kl];W[jm];B[lk];W[ln];B[jl];W[lm]C[A curious move. B can put w in atari at the ko but w would just connect
to the corner group above.];B[il];W[hl];B[ik];W[mk];B[lj]C[B grabs a few points
in the middle.];W[ij];B[jj];W[gg]C[A worthless move. If b makes it, w captures
in atari. Better to put those stones in atari one line higher, guaranteeing
their capture. In either case, it is a gote move.];B[ii];W[hj]
;B[qg]C[A gote move by b...];W[pg]C[That w answers in gote. A move like t4
would be good here.];B[op];W[nq];B[sp];W[rq];B[sq];W[rr]C[A nice series of sente
moves by b.];B[pr];W[pq];B[qr];W[sr];B[rn];W[ks];B[os];W[ns]
;B[ls];W[qs];B[rs];W[ss];B[ps];W[or];B[rs];W[qq];B[js]C[Good play by white to avoid a tenuki in
that corner. A worthwhile attack for b as it was done in
sente.];W[hs];B[kp];W[qs];B[en];W[do];B[cp]C[I do not think b needs this stone. b can turn a w cutting stone
here downward and then right to capture it. I do not see any threats of
capturing b stones.];W[ac];B[ab];W[ad];B[ba];W[ed];B[fa];W[de]
;B[ce];W[ee];B[gd]C[W failed to see and/or defend the double-
atari.];W[fd];B[ge];W[gf];B[he];W[je];B[jf]C[Wasted the snap-back move
again.];W[ok];B[pl];W[qj];B[rj];W[rk];B[rl];W[sj]C[A futile sequence for w.]
;B[sk];W[jh]C[A dame
point...there are other points to be made or saved elsewhere.]
;B[li]C[Like here,
for example, making one point for b.];W[im]C[More dame for w...]

makes two points.];W[ms];B[ks];W[pe];B[lh];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]
