I'll do my best

Horst];W[pc];B[dq];W[cd]C[I prefer attacking at D5, although my fuseki is a bit poor]
;B[co]
(;W[jp]C[Never too sure of this may be better to play it on the third line.
HT I am not sure, too, but I would like K3 more];B[mq]C[because this would not be so severe]

(;W[gp]C[but this one MUST be deeper or tenuki];B[qe];W[od]
C[too slow ? Didn't want too pincer because of the extension that black can make from Q4.
HT don't pincer, but O16 is probably faster.(You know, sai, there are komi nowadays)]
;B[pg]
(;W[ec]C[It all seems a bit slow now that I'm looking back on it.
HT U R right, blacks stones are well balanced, yours not];B[cf]
C[too near];W[ch]C[strike! good];B[ef];W[ck]C[This definitely doesn't look good was happy black didn't play C7 and started splitting my 2 weak groups.
HT I like your move, very good. w lives, having the option C7, E12 or B14]
;B[dh];W[di];B[eh]
(;W[qn]C[any suggestions here about where to invade will highly appreciated! This wasn't all that great.
HT for invasion: I would prefer the middle, maybe R8, R9, but your move is ok
but what about C13 or E11? you should have a stable group before playing elsewhere]
;B[qo];W[ql]C[Also here I wasn't really happy with R8 and I definitely didn't want too play Q6.
HT if you don't like  Q6 (its not so bad) then kosumi Q7, both moves make aji for R3]
;B[qj]
(;W[qd]C[wrong!
first help your group R6/R8, I showed some ideas]
(;B[rd];W[rc];B[re]C[U were lucky!];W[ro]C[good];B[rp];W[po]
;B[qp];W[pn]C[possible, but a little too slow]
(;B[dd];W[dc]C[thank U]
(;B[ce]C[bad]
(;W[ed]C[ok];B[de]
(;W[cc]C[Y not B16?];B[mc]C[oh my dear, black plays the way you want.]
;W[jc]C[and you do it right];B[kc];W[hc]C[May be K16 or K17 instead ?
Yes, K16 is better (K17 is forbidden and difficult ;) )];B[kd]
;W[cm]C[Y now?
There was no change for this group. C7 is no attack

o14 would be better];B[dm]C[??];W[dl]C[good];B[em];W[cn]C[be careful, this moves makes k/g4 insecure]
;B[do];W[dn];B[en]
(;W[ep]C[Decided not to cut, black could build a nice wall and also I could't read out completely if I would be able to take over the corner.

Your descion not to cut is ok, but there is a proverb: don't play NEAR a cut
I would prefer f3];B[eo];W[dp]C[leave it out, it's aji keshi
maybe later you don't like it];B[cq];W[cp]C[this doesn't work]
;B[bp];W[eq];B[er]C[maybe this is ok, but black has to defend B3/5]

f2 or b6 or k2];W[id];B[ie];W[he];B[if]
(;W[kf]C[Decided to make life a bit more difficult for black.
HT ok, but it doesnt help much];B[ke];W[hf];B[cg]C[You missed this move. Point for black!]
;W[bh]C[bad choice C11 would have been better didn't think of Black F11.
HT You are right];B[ei];W[dj];B[ej];W[ek]C[does this really divide?
i don't think so, better play J13];B[fk];W[ig]C[:)];B[lf]
(;W[kg]C[no, play k13 immediatly!];B[oe];W[ne]C[should be O16]

(;B[pe]C[wrong];W[nd]C[nice];B[me];W[nf]C[very, very nice];B[lg]
;W[nh]C[ok, but H13 will be a difficult attack];B[mh];W[oh]
C[P13?];B[ph];W[mj]C[bad shape, another "loose" stone, better  O10 if from his side,
but think about H13, l13 could be right];B[hg]C[now, you missed another urgent point]

(;W[jf]C[bad.. robbing myself of liberties.
HT very!!! bad];B[je]
(;W[ih]C[with no hope!];B[kh];W[jg];B[hh];W[ii]C[black likes it this way]
;B[kj];W[ik]
(;B[hi]C[too slow];W[jj];B[kk];W[im]C[Escaped.
HT who? black escaped with M14-group

Why did you escape with 3 stones after move 91?
The only reason can be: pressure against L15-group
please go back, have a look at B91, i show another 92];B[mi]
C[thos move is dangerous for W group Q17];W[fr]C[The narrow escaped promted me to establish my still weak groups.
You have another one on the right side:
I repeat: there was NO group, only 3 stones, before you made the mistake to escape!

BTW this point is good,

but P10 could help 2 week groups];B[br];W[rk]C[yeah!];B[rj]

(;W[sj]C[You dont want to live?]
(;B[si];W[sk];B[ri]
(;W[np]C[I dont like this move, it makes b very safe and you gain nearly nothing]

;B[nb]
(;W[qc]C[looks dead, if so better try P10];B[sc];W[sb]C[nice try ;)]

(;B[sd]C[Black should have played S2 obviously.
HT very obviously (S19)];W[ra]C[lucky again
lets count:
W 
right upper corner 3
left upper edge 20
left side 13
lower side 15 + a bit in he middle 4
right side 5 (max)
middle: nothing
sum 60

B
right lower corner 18
right side 10
upper side and part of middle 12
left lower corner 5
middle (around E13) 5
sum 50

feel good];B[km]
(;W[mn]C[maybe dangerous for J7-group];B[ml];W[gn]C[good];B[qk]
C[very bad];W[rm]C[This turned out to be the most expensive move of the game as you'll see later on.

;W[sp];B[sq];W[so]C[nice!];B[rq]C[Now if black wil play T7 white will have problem.. However I missed it completely as did Black for a while.

Please advice how to improve my game.

Many thanks,
Rahtol.

HT shit happens, every go-player has to suffer this kind of move sometimes.
I hope I could answer your questions.])
