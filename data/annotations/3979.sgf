C[This was a challenging game to comment. It is short and ends almost before it has started. It is sad that block lost game so early because the late middle game and end game would have been interestin from this fuseki.

One thing about me: I am intuitive player and I don't know how to play likek they do in the books. And my style is agressive so my comments won't fit everyone.

I commented some of you variations too, so remember to check them out.]

(;B[dd];W[pc];B[dp]
(;W[df]C[You asked for suggestions agains san-ren-sei.

When a game begins black has one advantage: initiative. By playing san-ren-sei on one side or chinese opening he gives up that initiative for some potential of teritory.

After that white has the initiative. He should try to keep that initiative as long as possible while building frameworks on the sides.

Black has two options. Either he plays solidly which could leave him overconcentrated, or then he attack agressively which would allow white to negate the san-ren-sei with invasion.]
;B[fd]C[I dont think that this was good idea. This white stone feels like it is crumbling under blacks presure. And white corner somehow looks misaligned.

So what can happen next: first white really has to settle that D14 stone but because it is on the fourth line this will be difficult. Perhaps white C16.

What ever happen, white will propably end up having a heavy group, which is unacceptable this early in the game. 

If you want to prevent black framework on this side you vould play at C11. Third line stones live easier.]
;W[ej]C[This is too thin. There should be some troubles comming for white.]
;B[dh]
(;W[eh];B[dg];W[eg];B[cf];W[ef];B[ce]LB[di:1]C[Playing at 1 is important. It will give white nice shape and prevent black side.  But the open corner cries for stone too.]
;W[qp];B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np]C[This joseki is bad for white. This black group is solid and now the white wall at the center is almost useless.]
;W[fq]C[This is dangerous. It invites black to complete the joseki with a stone that acts as a pincer too. This white stone may easily get heavy and in lot of trouble.

White has to keep this stone light.];B[jq]
(;W[fo]C[This ikken tobi makes this group pernanently heavy. It invites black to seal the corner while the other black group at lower side is perfectly solid.

Perhaps white could have played double approach, or invasion at san-san.]
;B[dn];W[fm];B[cj]
(;W[dl];B[dk];W[ek];B[cl];W[dm];B[cm];W[do]C[This kind of push is only ajikeshi. If you want to have fun in that corner, play at san-san or something similar.]
;B[co];W[dq];B[cq];W[ep];B[eo];W[en];B[dr];W[eq];B[do]C[That one black group at lower side is perfectly located. That group, and black F16, negate white super wall almost completely. But black is still overconcentrated and the nerve tearing phase of the game is about to start.]

(;W[ip];B[jp];W[io]C[These two white stones were useless. Now the black base is not only solid, but even I canot find any aji from it. And usually I can find aji from everywhere.]

(;B[id]C[Black playes safe but still took huge point.]
(;W[kc]C[This tries to block the black expansion, and it makes nice teritory. But game is over after black plays at R11 or something similar.]
;B[gf]C[Now is the last chance for white. Perhaps chinese like formation with R11.]
;W[hg]
(;B[hf];W[ig]
(;B[hj]C[This is about the last thing black should do. This will lead to heavy group that will propably get captured. And if it is not captured white will create huge teritory somewhere else.]

(;W[kn]C[This stone forces black to run straight to the part of board where white could still make teritory. Bad idea.Instead a stone around tengen would force black to run under continues presure while white builds a huge moyo. Then white only need to rescue his wall and game is his.]

(;B[kj]C[Black invasion at the center was resignation. It was just too deep.

I think he made that because of 'moyo jealousy'. The white center looked larger that it actually was. Just like the black side looks smaller than it is.

The big picture: this is just what white strategy should do, but the solid black group at the bottom should me this kind of invasions unnecessary.

Without that black invasion game would have been tight. The decisive factor would have been the white wall.  If white manages to use it effectively, he wins. Otherwise game is decided in the endgame.]

This variation would propably lead to uncontrolled fight.

Settle your stones early. Then you dont have to run. And if you opponent does not settle his groups, you will have a lot of fun later in the game.]

(;W[qp];B[dj]LB[fc:1][jd:3][df:2]C[San Ren Sei may feel overwhelming but that black side is actually not that large. White could play for example the sequence of white 1, black 2, white 3 which would leave black overconcertrated.]
