AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][jj]C[aga: It's interesting to see how
stronger player is handling you like a kid :-) According my current rank
(10k* NNGS) I have opportunities to play high handicap games with weaker
players too, so I know it sometimes very difficult to catch up handicap;
anyway - at the end of every handicap game with strong player I don't
understand where I managed to waste initial big
influence.];W[nq];B[pn];W[fq];B[iq]LB[lq:a]C[aga: If I'll manage
later to play 'a', then the game will look much better for me, comparing
with situation if w had played around K4 first.];W[cn]C[aga: I don't like
this counter pincer. My hopes for corner territory immediatelly
dissapiered, and w now have influence on one more side.

redeye:  For a handicap game, it is much too early to worry about corner
territory.  At this stage you must develop power and influence so that you
get maximum use out of your handicap stones.
...Black's next move at "a" is unorthodox.  Among other things, White has
the option of cutting and separating your corner handicap stone.
Generally, it is beneficial for White to cause trouble and complicate the
game.

Black 6 at "b" is better.];B[fo]LB[fp:a][eo:b][no:c]C[aga: I assume, 'a'
and 'b' are reasonable variations, but I suppose this move locks wF3
firmer. Additionally, it's closer to K10, just for case. ;-)

redeye:  again, don't worry about locking up 3 at this stage...this is
point is very important...3 might die a natural death.

...build power and influence...keep W separated and weak.  The simple play
with 6 at "b" is a step in the right direction.];W[cq]C[red:  B's next move
at "a" also shows why 6 is wrong.  ...Consider the order of moves...
If B already had a stone at a, he would never play on top with 6 on his
next move...Such a move would take territory only.  This is really wrong in
a handicap game.  Again, B doesn't worry about locking up 3 at this
stage.];B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cp];B[lq]LB[dn:a][jd:b]
C[aga: Is this move really ok,
or I should play around 'a' first?

redeye:  Now B is overconcentrated at the bottom.  ...14 is not needed at
this point.  Make the san-rensei at the top by playing
"b".];W[mp]MA[ko]C[Your 16 at X is too loose.  I might suggest the Fig.
(tree branch) starting with "a"]
(;N[Figure];B[ko]LB[pq:a][pj:b][jd:c]C[aga: Making territory while attaking
;-) But, again, maybe it'll be better to just lock corner with 'a', or even
tenuki at 'b' or 'c'?

red:  "c" is the play!];W[lo];B[kn];W[ln];B[nm]C[aga: Looks
somewhat awkward for me - too high to get territory on right side.

red:  20 is awkward.  The problem starts with 16--difficult to find good
continuations after that.];W[kp]C[22 should start at "b" - see dia. (tree
variation)]
(;N[Figure];B[lp];W[kq];B[jp];W[lr];B[jq];W[kr];B[lm];W[km]
;B[mn];W[mo]LB[ll:b]C[red:  play 32 at "b" (not"a").  Look what this does to
the right side.  Also, what will W do with poor 29
??];B[jm];W[kl];B[jl];W[ll];B[mm];W[lj]LB[qk:b]C[red: W just gets stronger and
makes good shape.

38 at "a" is too loose.  It should be at "b"];B[pj];W[ql];B[qm]
;W[pl]LB[ok:b]C[red:  42 at "b" is much better than "a"
--keep W separated and weak!];B[qj];W[qo]C[aga: Could w play
better? ;-) Before this move I thought I'll have some territory here, and
had expected only 3-3 or 3-4
invasion.];B[qn];W[po];B[oo];W[qp];B[op];W[pq];B[oq];W[pr];B[or]
;W[nr];B[os];W[rr]LB[nj:b]C[56 at "a" is a bad move.  W simply makes
the obvious move and lives in corner.   Save "a" as a ko threat !!

Play 56 at "b" --keep W separated.];B[ps];W[qs];B[nk]C[aga:
Suddenly I understood that just played stones are very weak. Maybe, I had
to leave Q4 as is for a while?];W[kj];B[ji]C[aga: L10 group looks weak and
small, but I don't see good way to handle with it.

red:   not so weak...W easily runs away with "a"];W[lh];B[qf]
C[aga: Actually, now I don't like this shimari. It's strong
along upper side, but wM12 will constrain extension there. But I feel I
should defend right side.

red:   You are right!  Otherwise W will force you to live small on the
right side, and in the process, he will badly damage your upper right
handicap stone.];W[cf]LB[di:b]C[64 at "b"   - puts much better pressure on
63.  ...also works well with B's center stones.];B[dj]C[aga: There is
something that looks for me like moyo ;-) around G7.];W[fc]
C[aga: I. DON'T.
LIKE. PINCERING. MY. CORNERS. ;-(


red:  66 should be on top of 65 (not 63)];B[df];W[cc];B[ce]
C[aga: Maybe,
I should play more usual C16?];W[dc];B[cg];W[ed]LB[if:b]C[red:   I don't like 72 at "a"


72 at "b" works well with B center stones.];B[kc];W[nc]LB[ne:b]
C[aga: Yes,
even L17 is too far. :-(

74 at "b" seems better.  It has potential for splitting attack; also it
makes upper right side look pretty good.];B[md]C[aga: I would like have w groups separated.


red:  this attempt at splitting attack leads to a very messy
fight.];W[nd];B[ne];W[oe];B[od];W[me];B[nf];W[ld];B[mc];W[lc]
;B[mb];W[lb];B[nb];W[ke];B[lf];W[le]LB[mf:b]C[red:  90 at
"b" (not "a")

W will get some territory on top, left side -- so what.   Then you will
kill 61 and be way ahead.];B[kf];W[mf]C[red: 91 now makes the game very hard for
black.];B[mg];W[ng];B[of];W[lg];B[mh];W[mi];B[nh];W[jf];B[kg]
;W[kh];B[jg];W[jh];B[ig]C[aga: bL17 makes some ajis, so I still have hope
to kill one of group I've just cutted.];W[ih];B[hg];W[jk];B[ik]
;W[kk];B[ij];W[nj];B[oj];W[og]C[aga: Lower group looks weaker, so O12 is more important
for me than O14.];B[oh];W[pf];B[oc];W[mk];B[ki];W[nl];B[ok]
;W[om];B[ol];W[nn]C[aga: Well, stronger player is stronger player, because
he is stronger player. :)];B[on];W[ml];B[pm];W[ph];B[li];W[oi]
