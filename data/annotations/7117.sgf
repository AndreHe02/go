;B[em];W[dj]C[D10 seems too ambitious.  There appears to be moves for black around c9, and the D4 group is not in good shape either.  While D4 is far from dead, black can pressure it, as his following moves demonstrate.  D4 will get strong from an attack on C8 or D4, so it is hard for white to attack these stones.  It is more likely white will be the one attacked by the D7 stones.

It may seem odd that D4 is weak being that it is typically considered to be thick, but walls are notorious for being made into "fake" thickness.  Their lack of eyes makes them hard to defend, so walls must be tended to very carefully should they come under attack.  

Thsi is not to say that C8 should not be defended first, but in the position here, black is the attacker.  White should therefore play to reduce the number of weaknesses in his shapes on either side of black's d7 stones.  C11 to settle C8 or maybe g4 or g5 for the d4 group are some moves to consider.]
;B[hp];W[hn]C[This is somewhat painful for you; the stones to the right, k4 and 03, are not strong.  White pretty much has to push black H4 in their direction to help stabilize D4.  This leads me to think that the smaller investment of c8 was the wrong group to defend when D10 was choosen; that a move to help D4 was more in order at that time.]
;B[io];W[jm];B[jo];W[kp];B[kn];W[hl]C[Here is the crux of the matter for white: white ends up having to defend both sides, and black escapes leaving a lot of aji in whites groups.  Points like M3 or F6 are potentially hard to deal with for white.  Further, white doesn't end up with many points, or potential.]
;B[fq]C[This seem like a mistake by black.  F5 or F6 seem like they might more effectively trap the D4 group.]
;W[fo];B[pq];W[no];B[lm];W[nm];B[ml];W[nl];B[pl]
(;W[kk]C[This seems to be pushing black where he wishes to go: to connect with the right side.  Regardless, it is a sente move, but applies little pressure on the black group as L9 seems to lack good followup moves.  See variation for an alternate possibility.]
;B[mj];W[mm];B[ll]
(;W[lo]C[I'm not convinced this move is required.  I've run through some variations on what might happen.  It is possible I have missed a sequence where black can successfully cut.

If black is able to cut here, then having to fix at M5 is just part of the price of pushing black's H4 stone toward your weaker group.]
;B[lj];W[nc]C[This should probably be O16.  letting black black O16 completes his box shape way too nicely.]

C[Black gets away with too much through here.  White certainly can't compensate for the amount black gets on the right side.  And that area is pretty much points now; white doesn't have much reduction possibiity, nor does it look invadable.  

This result is why I would have considered the crazy looking move around S14 earlier.]
;W[ld];B[le];W[kd];B[fc]
(;W[ec]TR[dj][kk][hl]C[This feels like the wrong direction for white.  Your triangled moves are all asking to be developed by some uppser side thickness.  F16 seem more appropriate for them.  see variation.]

(;W[qj];B[qk]C[Black plays a good, shape move, and I would say whites cnahces for life are nil.  The critical point for your opponent is often the critical point for you, so wR9 was probably the first move to attempt.  see variation.

That being said, there is not a lot of room for white to live here even starting from R9.  Black has solidified a strong moyo.]

(;W[de];B[bf]
(;W[be]C[C15 is correct, as again you should try to play solidly.]
;B[cg]C[White creates a sente move for black here, and that is worth move to black than what he lost due to being restricted by B15.]
;W[ce];B[hg];W[gh];B[hh];W[gi];B[hi]C[h10?];W[hj];B[ck]C[The weakness at c9 mentioned earlier now gets exploited.  I think d8 is a good response.]
;W[dl];B[bk]C[keep disconnected]
(;W[dk]C[Keep black disconnected.  there maybe a kill in it for you.  See variation for one possibility.  Again I didn't explore the whole tree, so there maybe ways for black to live.  However, forcing black to live there gains sente, keep the points black gains around B12 to a minimum, and creates some end game moves against the b6 group.]
;B[cj];W[or]C[B8 is bigger.  it either kills, or is much bigger sente than this.  Threats against the life of groups are bigger than moves for points.]
;B[pr]
(;W[iq]C[The group there is fine, and this is not a sente move.  B8 or B7 to cut is much bigger as it is sente.  Black must be pretty careful not to die or end up in  a ko too.]
;B[fb];W[eb]C[It is arguable that B8 is the better move even here.  White can come back to this if black lives, and if black dies, the life of the D16 group is secured.]

;B[rb];W[rc];B[qb];W[pb];B[sc]TR[pa][qa][ra][sa][pb][qb]C[White loses 6+ points here from not playing S17.  The plus comes from the fact black maybe able to score points at s19, t19, t18, and t16.  Black does that by playing R19.  Getting this move first improves the score dramatically.  Preventing this move and h1 could have made the game close to even.]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[gp];B[gq];W[ho];B[ip];W[in]C[Again, a small gote move.  R19 is big here.  C5, B8 are sente, and there are a bunch of other 1 point sente moves besides.]

It can easily be said that it was white's end game mistakes that let black win so heavily.  In fact, with a better end game, white might have been able to win.  White needed much more emphasis on sente moves, and moves that threaten to kill in the end game.  

While there were some mistakes in the opening that affected the progress of the game in big ways, it is in  the end game where I think you stand to learn the most.  

I hope this helped :)

The options presented next are some ways to continue expanding your potential.  Comnbinations of a move on the top side with one on the bottom side would be most beneficial.  G15 followed by K11 seems to work just fine.]
