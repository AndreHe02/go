C[tctufts53 [20k\]: hi
------------------------------------------
Hello!
I'm Tim, or Talaer on KGS. My rank right now is somewhere around the 11-12 kyu range. I'll leave my comments and responses to yours designated with " T: ".

Hopefully I'll be of some help for you. I will try to be thorough without being overwhelming. If you have any questions please let me know and I will help you some more!]
;B[pd];W[cp]C[pertoskyu [20k?\]: hi];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]C[chinese opening]
;W[fq]C[is K16 better than k4?
would d15 have been a better move?];B[jp]C[T: I don't know much about openings this early. All I've ever read and been told is that the opening is where you exert most of your personal style. Play the things that you are most comfortable with and play them regularly so that you can compare responses and how things worked or didn't work out for you.

I think any of the moves you listed are good. Personally I like the top side better because your opponent is less strong there (two stones compared to one). Also, since his upper left shimari (if formed) will face K16, it is extra valuable. D or C15 would be playable, but doesn't seem to quite flow with the rest of your moyo-creating stones.]
;W[cf];B[jc]C[T: You ended up getting both points anyway.
Also note that your opponent has formed two wide enclosures instead of the normal one-space type. These are more susceptible to later attack.]
;W[qg]C[r15 could be better for black? but how would white respond? jump to P13?

T: I prefer R15, and white will pretty much have to jump out to avoid an extremely damaging attack.]

(;B[nd];W[qc];B[qd]C[r16 seems ok - keeping white stones separated.

T: Quite correct. Especially given O16 already in place.];W[pc]
;B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[sd];B[qf];W[ob];B[nb];W[oa]LB[qa:A][qb:B]
[rb:C]C[T: Here I think you may have a chance to kill as your opponent did not play correctly. You've already been given great thickness in sente, but he could potentially lose everything. Playing O19 first gives him the chance to make living shape, so it is important to strike at weakness first since he definately can't escape or form eyes through O19.

The more you play the more you'll become familiar with where to strike, but some points leap at me immediately.]

(;B[na]C[T: From those variations, the most I can see is possibility for seki. There may be other potential moves as well.]
;W[qb]C[T: Here he responds with a poorly shaped move, and I think it is still possible to get a seki.]

(;B[cj];W[qi]C[T: Your strength in this area is tremendous, I think he is asking for trouble here.]

(;B[pg];W[ph]
(;B[og];W[rg]
(;B[rf]C[black 31 creates poor shape - so is P12 better? or p9? to build a moyo?

T: Definately P9.  P12 may help his stones gain good shape and hurt R9 even more.]
;W[qj];B[rk];W[pk];B[qn];W[pm];B[pn];W[qm]C[is s10 better for black than s7?]

(;B[rm];W[om];B[on];W[rj];B[sk];W[sj];B[rn];W[ql];B[rl];W[ok]
C[T: This seems quite the slow move for White. His group is pretty safe now.]
;B[ni]C[T: This does good to help your influence. Personally I think I would help the lone stone on the left though. It is more urgent than just taking some points in gote.]

(;W[oh];B[nh];W[mk]C[T: It is crude for W to have pushed at P12 if he did not intend to cut at O13.]
;B[cm]C[T: Good!];W[gd]C[debateable j15 or d13?

T: Making the correct decision at this point is hard. J15 doesn't seem too huge to me at the moment. A move I'd consider is H3.  H3 closes your 'open skirt' at K4 AND threatens to invade White's wide enclosure.]

(;B[ie];W[mq]
(;B[jr]C[T: Letting W go in this situation seems very painful, your largest territory is nearly erased and you have no counter-invasion to bring balance back.]

;W[go];B[kn];W[mn];B[nm];W[nn];B[mm];W[lm];B[nk];W[nl];B[nj]
;W[pj]C[T: White got to play peacefully and you are left with a potential group for attack.]
;B[ki]C[T: This definately helps nab some points in the middle. I think W around K13 could still be somewhat damaging.]
;W[ln];B[ko];W[nq];B[or];W[oq];B[pp];W[oo];B[po];W[op];B[gm]
;W[fm];B[gl];W[fl];B[fk];W[gn]C[should black have blocked at h6?

T: I don't think blocking there leads to many points since W can accomplish the same goal via the M7 area. Helping the C10 group is definately on the table now as W is starting to build over it.]

;B[hi];W[gj]
(;B[fi];W[gi];B[hh];W[gh];B[ef];W[gf]C[c13 next for black?

T: A potential move, but not necessarily the best. It may help to threaten his enclosure there, but otherwise there are not a lot of points there.]
;B[ig]C[is j13 too defensive - definitely not sente!

If anything, it is better at H13 since this is the spot W would use for pushing in. Also he may feel compulsed to connect against the peep, even though it would not be needed.]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[dh];B[fh];W[fg]C[T: White got to eat your stone and remove its meaning. That is a good result for him.]

;B[lo]C[Relatively small endgame points in the face of F1 and B12. The score can sway a LOT in endgame if you are very attentive to grabbing big sente moves first. Lost games can be turned around if you have an opponent who plays an endgame too passively.]
;W[mp];B[im];W[km];B[fs];W[es];B[gs];W[dr];B[bg];W[bf];B[bh]
;W[hf]C[T: Since W poking into J14 doesn't hurt you very badly, I would go ahead and grab A14 first. Think of this as boldly stating "I believe my move is better than your own!"

If you block at J14 first, then you keep one point and he gets to block A14.]

(;B[ip];W[hr]C[T: The score estimator shows you are slightly ahead by the end of the game, so the one critical thing at the end is what flipped it the other way. I think you were able to get/keep that lead by nabbing some of the better endgame points and getting a decent amount in the middle.

I think your fastest improvement will come through some Life and Death study to improve critical point spotting and judgement of groups. Also, experience in finding which points are big and why in the late opening/early middle game will help greatly.

Since I was so tardy in getting this to you ( I somehow missed the initial email ), I am willing to play some teaching games with you if you like. ( I also enjoy doing them, hehe :)

My email address is helxis@comcast.net and I go by Talaer on KGS.]

(;B[hr]C[T: Doesn't appear to have a followup now. This goes to show though, every weak group created can hound you until the very end of a game. The worst are the ones that bite you after you think they are safe, hehe.]

(;B[gi]C[T: I think solid here is better. It is very difficult to contain a string of stones like this, especially when they aren't fighting to live. Just make sure your left side lives, and take as many points in the middle as you can.]

;W[lp]
(;B[lo];W[jq]C[T: After this exchange, I can't really seem to find a workable variation to keep this group from living/escaping. It does however maintain connectivity among your own stones while losing relatively the same amount of territorial area.]

[dr][er][as][bs][cs][ds][es]C[T: Something like this may be good. It is hard to gain a lot points in the middle because everyone has stones poking into it from lots of directions.

Doing a brief estimated count we get:
W: 52 + komi = 58.5 
B: 70

Given an estimated lead means you should try to  peacefully settle the game. This basis is on the idea that W can't invade into the N4 area. Also you may look forward to your upper side giving you more points in the center depending on how the game flows. W of course has sente in this variation, which could mean the game going back and forth quite closely but I think H3 helps to protect against invasion in your largest territory.]
