AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Dear Joseph,

I'm going to review this game. I myself am 1st Kyu, so I'm not sure how much I can tell about w's mistakes.
I will mark my comments with an R (for review).

I hope I can help you improve.

best regards,
tom



Dear reviewer,

I am closer to 7kyu in strength, so I am not lucky to have won!!
But I want to know how to play better.

I feel I played a very strong fuseki but made some mistake in choban.
Some spots are very tough for me.

Please review for both sides so I can see the W mistakes too!

Thank you,
Joseph];W[nc];B[kd]C[I learn this handicap pincer from "Kages Secrets to Handicap Go".  I hope to disconnect W right away.]

(;B[nq];W[dn];B[eo];W[df]C[R: I wouldn't have liked it being forced by two double kakaris.]
;B[ee]C[White looks very disconnected!  Black succeeded?

R: e15 and e5 were big moves, as it is important to keep your stones working together. But If you look at it, w didn't take care on the connection of his kakari-Stones. At the moment w's just trying to place some stones on the board. Seems kind of random.]
;W[qn]LB[ql:C][qo:A][rp:B][hq:D]C[What option does Black have to play?  I thought 'A' was only and best choice?

R:Tough call, because w plays very light. W is prepared to saccrifice any single stone, he's playing. A, B and C as direct answers to r6, leave the weakness at r3. That allows w to activate o4. You've made a lot of effort to nihilate the cutting effect of o4, so maybe just r4 might be an adequat answer.]

(;B[qo]
(;W[ro]LB[pn:B][rp:A]C[Which one is better?

R: both ok, depends on what you want.];B[rp]C[S4 or Q6 wasnt sure...]
;W[oq];B[pn]C[I feel very happy to take both critical points for my moyo.

R: You should think a little bit more in weak and strong groups. At the moment w doesn't have a single strong group. He's trying to form one, that has a base and is not closed in. So after this sequence, w succeded in forming his first somewhat stable group. But he gave you seccure territory on the right; so the trade seems ok.]

[oc:D][om:C][gp:A]
(;B[cq]LB[hc:B][oc:D][om:C][gp:A]C[Is this a strong move?

R: your move is big, without a question, but a bit slow imo, because nothing tragic happens if w plays there. I prefer A or D]
;W[md]LB[ne:A]TR[kd]C[I want to take the moyo so I will extend to 'A'.   Is this good because of the moyo size and also the location of the L16 stone is high?  This marked stone and group will soon die and I wonder how to save it.

R: Moyo is territory framework. Mostly used to force your opponent to invade it, so he forms a weak chaseable group. L16 seems safe at the moment.]
;B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[me]
(;B[nf]C[R: not a good move, because the cutting weakness remains, and w gets to push a move further - allthough he's pushing from behind.]
;W[ic]LB[id:A][kf:B]C[How can B  proceed here?

R: maybe cut. W succeeded in connecting two weak groups to a strong one with a lot of territory at the top and you got a weak group - actually atm is a single stone: run and treat him light; or cut and fight]

(;B[id];W[jc]LB[jd:A]C[Is connecting the only move here?]
