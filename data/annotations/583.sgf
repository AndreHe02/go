;B[dp];W[pd];B[ed];W[pp];B[dj]C[Although there are exceptions, one should play corner moves prior to side moves.  Since you don't know the outcome of the
upp
er left corner, the game move may not be effective.  White can choose a joseki that renders the game move ineffective.]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[iq];B[mq]TR[iq]LB[qn:a][nq:b]C[There are two approaches to the lower right corner: 'a' or 'b'.  A general principle is to approach the corner on the side
wh
ere there's more space.  'a' is the right direction because the right side is open.  Approaching the corner at 'b' doesn't give
black
 much extension room because of the marked stone.  In addition, white will attack black immediately.  See variation B.]

(;W[pq];B[jr]LB[kq:a]C['a' is better.  I know you want to settle quickly, but the game move makes white's left group stronger.]
;W[ir];B[jq];W[dq]LB[jp:a][kp:b][ko:c]C[White should hane at 'a', the head of two stones.  This is a pivotal point and whoever hanes first gains a lot of power.  If
black plays 'b', white can double hane at 'c'.];B[cq];W[ep]

;W[fg];B[gf];W[gg];B[nc]LB[ef:a][eg:b]C[Again, the exchange of black 'a' and white 'b' makes white heavy.]
;W[kc];B[id]LB[ic:a]C[I like 'a' because it defends black's corner a bit better.]
;W[ke];B[ne];W[if];B[hf]C[Although you gain some territory, this move and next make white stronger.  It's better to wait for the right opportunity to
c
ut white into two groups and follow up with a double attack.]

[qf][rf][sf]C[I would prefer to extend at 'a' with a follow up at 'b'.  When you are debating where to extend, find out if the point you
ch
oose has a good follow up.];W[ql];B[qk]LB[qn:a]C[You are trying to protect your territory, but the game move helps white to solidify his corner.  Tenuki for now and later
you
 can think about the invasion at 'a'.];W[ol];B[rk];W[rl]LB[qn:a]

;W[qd]LB[nf:a][mg:b][og:c][nh:d]C[You played 'a' next.  This is a common pattern and the proper move is 'b' and white will extend at 'd'.  Your next move is
so
mewhat aji-keshi.  By playing 'b', you can decide at a later time whether atari-ing at 'a' or 'c' is better.]

;W[jk];B[lj]LB[mi:a]TR[oh][oi][oj][pi]C['a' is the vital point (middle of three stones) for a pattern formed by the marked stones.]
;W[mi];B[li];W[mj];B[mk];W[lh];B[kk];W[jm];B[lm]LB[or:a]C[The game move doesn't have any profit.  Your lower group is the only weak group.  Slide to 'a' to settle.]
