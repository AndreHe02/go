;B[op];W[qp];B[oq];W[oo];B[pn];W[qm]LB[nq:B][qq:A]C[i don't know this joseki very well, but i know this is off the main lines of the joseki, wasn't sure how to proceed

reid: Indeed! This is a joseki that amateurs have no reason to be playing!  As black, you can simplify the joseki in several ways (see variations).

White makes the first mistake (which is odd since he picked this joseki to start with).  The usual move is to block the corner with A, which black answers with B.

White R7 fails to take either the corner, or any of black's liberties.  I'd be tempted to play black A next to try to punish white. Since black has the strong formation in the upper right, he doesn't need to fear white building up thickness by attacking the two Q5-6 stones.]

(;B[pm]C[reid: this is probably OK for black too.];W[qn]C[reid: Well, it's a bit difficult to advise you on shape when we're deep into an unknown variation of one of the most complicated josekis known to man!  Here I'd say Q8 and R3 are black's obvious choices.  Less obvious might be O6.  If white connects at O5, then black can block the corner with R3.  But it's complicated.  Q8 has the advantage of simplicity.]
;B[pl];W[no];B[qq];W[qk]C[reid: Now that's a clear mistake for white.  See variation.]

(;B[pk]C[black helps white patch up his problem (aji-keshi).]
;W[qj];B[mq];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp]
(;B[mm]C[reid: this looks like it should be an attack, but in fact, it doesn't have much affect on white.  White has good moves at O3 and at P11, so black is struggling.

Black probably needs to push again with Q10.  See variation.]
;W[kq];B[nd]C[reid: now this is a mistake by black.

One very noticable difference between pro games and amateur games is that pros don't leave a situation until it's resolved (we may not understand the resolution, but the pros almost always do).  Here, whoever plays first in the bottom right will get a big advantage.  So black should not abandon this area yet - he should resolve this situation first.]
;W[nq]C[reid: white gets it first!  Now white will be able to take two black stones which suddenly changes the whole strategic situation in the lower right.  This shift it strategic power is worth far more than the stone at O16.

The proverb says "play the urgent point, not the big point".]
;B[nr];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp]C[reid: By connecting, white allows black to fix his problem.  White should play at N2 instead (the R6 white stones are in no danger, even if black takes S3 with S4).]
;B[sr]C[reid: but black doesn't want to fix his problem.];W[or]
C[reid: so white gets to take two stones. 

Actually, white N2 is better than P2. When black takes P2 with Q2, his shape is aji-less.]
;B[pr];W[mr];B[os];W[mc]C[reid: taking two stones with M2 is probably bigger.

If white M2 is followed by black O17, white P11 looks like it will give white a good game.  And the P17 stone is not completely dead yet.]
;B[ld]C[reid: As long as white had P11, getting outside strength is not going to help black much.

Black can help his Q7 group indirectly by playing M2.  Not only does this rescue his two stones, but more importantly, it removes white's eye-shape so the Q7 black stones are on a more equal footing against the M4 white stones.]
;W[md];B[me];W[od];B[oe];W[nc]C[reid: white is just helping black get thick.  These are all aji-keshi moves and should not be played.]
;B[ne];W[kb];B[jc]C[i feel like this was a slack move now, move in the lower left seems better?

reid: Again, M2 is the key point for white's eyes.];W[eq]C[reid: If black had played M2, then white E3 would clearly be trouble (black can invade and split at G or H 3).]
;B[dn];W[km];B[kl]C[reid: Black will help white get strong - that's a natural consequence of a contact play.  If black is hoping to get center territory, he should remember that white R10 greatly reduces his potential.]
;W[jl];B[kk];W[jk];B[kj]C[reid: these moves are better for white than for black.  Black is too close to his strong P15 wall.]
;W[fo];B[pi];W[qi];B[ph];W[pj];B[oj];W[qh];B[ii]C[reid: making center territory is the least effective use of your stones (corners first, sides second, center last).

Intead of this sequence (starting with L8), black can simply approach the upper left corner.  But it's an uphill battle, for sure.]
;W[pg];B[og];W[oi];B[oh];W[ok]C[reid: white is playing endgame moves already.  Too soon.  Later, he may wish he could play these moves differently.]
;B[nj];W[cl];B[dq];W[er];B[lr]C[reid: Now M2 is just an endgame move (because the L4 stones have so many friends nearby, they are no longer in any danger).]
;W[kr]C[reid: Since M2 is a yose play, white should tenuki and play the urgent move.  White E7 would be terrible for black!]
;B[cj];W[el];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm]C[reid: so we can see what a difference it would make if white had played E7 instead of L2!]
;W[eo];B[dm];W[ch];B[dl];W[eh];B[gg]C[reid: black leaves behind a problem at H12.  Black probably knows he's going to invade at C17 soon, so he should anticipate that white will get very strong. Then H12 could be a problem.

Black can invade directly at C17 instead of G13.];W[hc];B[cc]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[hf];B[ig]
;W[if];B[jf];W[je];B[kf];W[kd]C[reid: oops, misread by white?  L17 is much better.]
;B[lc];W[lb];B[kc]C[reid: ouch - that's painful for white.  Black gets a lucky break!]
;W[hg];B[hh];W[gh];B[fh];W[gi];B[fi];W[hi];B[ih];W[fg];B[eg]
;W[gf];B[dh];W[ei];B[di];W[fj];B[cg]C[reid: this sequence feels like black made a big gain, but it's not really that good.  White just made his points somewhere else, and black ends in gote.

If black wants points in gote, he should first play Q18, white K18, then black S14 gets a pretty good size corner.  Or D2 is big gote too.]
;W[fb];B[db];W[qb];B[rb];W[qc];B[rc];W[ql]C[reid: wasting a ko threat?  Or maybe white thinks black won't see it?]
;B[nm];W[jb]C[reid: white is alive.  C14 is bigger.];B[jm];W[im]
;B[jn];W[kn];B[go];W[ho]C[reid: H6 seems like a safer way for white to handle this.
