C[Hello!
First of all: Thanks for taking your time to review my game!

So i played black in this game and would like to know, where i made big mistakes and how to answer better in some situations.
I'll add some questions.

Thanks for reviewing,
Kevin

G: Hello. I will mark my comments with this G.];B[pd]C[thierryter [7k\]: gg
Light93 [7k\]: hi gg];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc]
;B[ic];W[qo];B[np]C[Better to play something like Q9?

G: hard to answer for me. I see nothing wrong with O4 at our level.]
;W[ql];B[qp];W[rp];B[rq];W[qf];B[qh]C[This? Or something like N16?

G: R12 looks good to me. We split two white groups which are not settled yet.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[pe];B[rd];W[re];B[qe];W[pp];B[qd]C[Filling this atari.. a good decision?

G: I would have answered at R3. It's a really big move. Then we can still fight the ko and get compensation somewhere.
Now the problem is that white can treat R14 lightly if he wants to, and R12 is too close from our strong R15 group and therefore inefficient.]
;W[qq]C[G: I feel that this really hurts. White's group is basically safe, has nearly taken our corner, and our stones are now unsettled, with a white stone waiting for us at D4.]
;B[qr];W[oq];B[qp];W[rf]
(;B[qq]C[Again, filling good?

G: It mays have been good to play P4 instead. See the simple variation for example.]
;W[op];B[po]C[G: looks complicated. have you read the whole sequence? Do you know the outcome of this?]
;W[oo];B[ro]C[G: What was the purpose of playing Q5 ?
If your goal was to be compltely alive, play S5 directly.
Though it might have been better to simply play elsewhere.]
;W[pn]C[G: now white's strength on the outside is annoying]
;B[qn];W[qm];B[pf];W[pg];B[oe];W[lc]
(;B[nc]C[Here i didnt really know how to answer.. maybe M15 better? Or play R13?

G: major mistake here. This is the wrong direction. To attack, you should play in order to push your opponent towards your strong group. Here you are just making 3-4 points of territory while giving way for a white escape.
see variation for an example];W[jp];B[le];W[kd];B[je];W[ke]
;B[kf];W[jd];B[ie];W[id];B[hd];W[hc];B[hb];W[he];B[gc];W[jf]
;B[if];W[lf];B[kg];W[me];B[mf];W[ld]
(;B[lg]C[G: maybe N13 better. See variation, try to explore on your own how it works out.
Your goal here should be to seal white in (even if it means white lives)]
;W[nf];B[mg];W[ne];B[of];W[ng];B[og];W[nh]C[G:  White got out. This is a result you should learn to hate.]
;B[ph]C[G: i would prefer R13];W[rh];B[cn]C[Good to play tenuki here? I was scared that he would develope the left side.

G: well it's a tough question. R13 is not only points, it also keeps you connected. R13 from white will be sente (you need to answer at P12).
also if you look carefully, your center group has a problem. What if white plays K13 ?
In my opinion your should  make the center group safe in priority. That would also help prevent white from developping the left side too much, since you would build strength.
The situation for black is not very good now, mainly because white got out at 012.]
;W[qg];B[ck]C[G: I'd answer at P12, it looks huge.
If you really have to play in the lower left corner, why not F3? in the game if white plays now C5, black D6, white F3, it's very good for white.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[oh];B[gp];W[fq];B[gq];W[iq];B[ch];W[hf];B[ig]
;W[hg];B[hh];W[fg];B[jh];W[ii];B[ih];W[gh];B[hi];W[gi];B[kj]
;W[mj];B[rn];W[rm];B[ij]C[G: quite small. I'd say you have priority moves like P2, then somethhing around L7 to try and reduce white. But even with th, white seems ahead. You'd need to try some aggressive yose here, trying to get sente moves.]
;W[ll];B[ln]C[I had something to do against the right side, should i have done something earlier?
And is that a good way to invade?

G: it's about as far as you can go. But it looks difficult. L6 looks safer. A little bit earlier would have been better I guess.]
;W[jm];B[km];W[kl];B[jn];W[in];B[im];W[jl];B[io];W[hn];B[jo]
;W[ho];B[ip];W[hp];B[kp];W[jq];B[kq];W[kn];B[ko];W[hq]
(;B[nq]C[G: I'd rather play P2. It connects your stones now that you have L3.]
;W[lm];B[or]C[G: yes, safe move.];W[fn];B[eo];W[fo];B[ep];W[eq]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[bo];W[cr];B[bq];W[en]C[G: I'm not sure about this whole sequence. You lost 4 stones and the ability to play G2 to split white. You gained a few points on the left.Not sure if that is good.
Maybe instead of C3 it would have been good to play F3 and see how white answers that.]
;B[nn];W[nm];B[on];W[om];B[po];W[od];B[no]C[Now i realise that this wasnt necessary because he couldnt escape at the bottom with one move.

G: you said it];W[pe];B[oc];W[bm];B[bn];W[cl];B[dl];W[bk]
(;B[cm]C[G: C10 instead and white is all dead. White cannot get out at D7 Atari is often not the best option.]
