AB[dd][pp]C[Game ID: 407269, ratedhi! Game was played on DGS, and I'm white.
I feel i was lost and bit confused in the beginning then in the 
late game you can see only dieing. :) Could you give me some 
suggestions how to improve fuseki and early middlegame in low 
handicap games? Many thanks -- gergely]PL[W];W[dp];B[pc];W[jc]
LB[pe:A]C[I would prefer attacking with "A" (or one space to the right), but this is certainly possible. "A" puts more pressure on black's komoku and can help make the game more complex, which is a way to overcome the handicap.]
;B[qe];W[jq];B[cn]LB[fp:A][cl:B]
(;W[co]C["Never touch weak stones." This is because your opponent becomes strong in the process. "A" would be a better play, or a pincer, like "B", could also work.]
;B[dn];W[fp];B[cj]C[Compared to variation "A", black's group has better potential, compared to "B", white has less influence.]

(;W[qj]LB[qm:A][qg:B]C[R9 more ballanced maybe? I felt uncomfortable to let duoble extension 
from the upper right shimari.

This is much too close to black's thickness. I cannot imagine why black did not follow up with "A" . Surely you can see the pain of making a two-point extension to "B"? Black's thickness would have caused white a lot of trouble.

It's important to realize that though black is leading, you can't try to take the territory that is rightfully his.]
;B[qh];W[qm];B[nq];W[rp];B[lq];W[jp]LB[jo:A]C[This seems too slow. Jumping to "A" is better.]
;B[qq]
(;W[rq]C[R5 or even tenuki would be better i fear.  What do you say?

This move is much better than R5. Sure, it may seem like a play on the third line is stronger, but it would leave black with the option of playing S3 and you would lose the chance to play R2, a large endgame move (about 5 point sente move, follow-up gote sequence of another 5 points).

I would tenuki now to reduce black's left side. This is certainly too early to play now, but it is nonetheless a very good move later on.]

(;W[di]MA[ee][fn][dn][cj]LB[ej:A]C[I thought such a huge moyo is not tolerable. :) Shoulder hit was choosen, i had no better idea. What options can be considered to invade/reduce this moyo?
This is normally a good choice, but because of black's strength on the top-left, I would consider "A" instead. It's not as severe, but white is safer.

The reason I wouldn't play the shoulder hit because of the location of black's marked stones. C10 prevents sabaki on the side and black's 5th and 6th line stones (E15 and F6) make this move feel more like an invasion than a reuction, no?]

(;W[ch];B[bf];W[dj];B[ck];W[df]TR[ef]LB[gi:A]C[The exchange of white 45 and where black should have played is bad for white.
Simply jumping to "A" is best.];B[cf];W[ef];B[fg];W[eh]C[White's shape has become heavy. When invading/reducing, white should play lightly - not be afraid to sacrifice a stone or two for the reduction/invasion to work better.]
;B[hf];W[je]LB[gi:A]C[I wanted to keep weak black group to remain weak. However to 
save *my* weak group seems to be better strategy now. What do 
you think?

I agree. Black 52 was too painful to deal with. "A" is better - it's best to keep with the fundametals.]
;B[gi];W[em];B[el]LB[fj:A]C[Perhaps A would be a way for white to escape, though black will gain influence/territory for attacking such a weak group.]

(;W[fm]C[It is important for white to let his large group escape to the center. These stones have no strategical purpose, they just give black great influence.]

(;W[nm]C[:-))];B[nn];C[Result: B+Resign

In the beginning, white was too concerned with preventing black from gaining too much territory that it weakened his groups and could not fight back.

The most important thing for you to learn is determining exactly which stones are necessary and which are expendable, and study the fundamentals to achieve good shape quickly.

I was glad to be able to review your game since I often have trouble deciding how best to make good shape. I hope my review helps you as much as it did me!]
