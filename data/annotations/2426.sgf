C[I think it was just too much for me... when I thought I was getting influence and some territory I was just being blocked off and my stones really had no effect...I knew I was playing against a really good player, but I wanted to try anyways...]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pq];B[qo];W[op]LB[oo:A][np:B]C[I think this stone is too slow and A or B might be 
better.];B[ql];W[fc]C[I remember learning about joseki and playing this was 
one of them..

Be careful with joseki, I don't know what strengh you 
are, but its better to learn your way around go before 
going into joseki.];B[dc];W[jd]LB[id:A][ic:B]C[I could swear that extending was good, because I 
would be getting more territory right??

A or B would be better, since it limits blacks ability to 
cut those two stones.  It is said that the 4th line is for 
influence, and the 3rd line is for territory.  In this case 
B might be better since the right side is open.];B[cf];W[ee]
LB[nc:A][qf:B][ch:C]C[There are bigger moves I think then this stone. Try A, 
B or C. Never get focused on one area, always look at 
the whole board.];B[nc];W[lc];B[hc]LB[he:A]C[I think a white stone here next turn instead of touching 
the black stone would be better.  Then the idea would 
be to contain the black stones and prevent eye space.];W[hd]
;B[gc];W[gd];B[fb]C[he then somehow managed to get right under me, and i think I just lost a lot of the territory that I thought I had...]
;W[fd];B[eb];W[ic];B[ib];W[jb];B[hb];W[mb]C[I really felt cheated so i wanted to get at least a little 
bit from the upper  place...

I think there are bigger moves on the board.];B[nb];W[ma];B[na]
;W[ia]C[Again bigger moves, this gets you very little extra 
possible territory, and gives black sente.];B[ha];W[ja];B[mc]
;W[lb];B[qf];W[jp];B[fq]C[then he comes right inside and I have no clue what to do... so I try to defend my corner...]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[ep]LB[iq:A]C[remember, your best move is your opponents best 
move.  This is generally true, thats why a stone at A or 
closer would be good as it limits any possible black 
grab for eye space, and it also defends your bottom 
area.  The connecting stone is not a good move I think 
because one, it makes an empty triangle (which are 
bad, or so people say), two, it gives black sente, and 
three its not aggressive at all.];B[iq];W[jq];B[ip];W[fr];B[gr]
;W[er];B[jo];W[lp];B[jr];W[kq]LB[kr:A]C[A stone at A would prevent further expansion.]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[cn]C[This was a big move, and it would have been better if 
you had taken this instead.];W[rq]LB[cl:A]C[This stone is helpful in securing the corner, but a 
move at A is much bigger.];B[rp];W[qp];B[ro];W[on];B[pn];W[po]
LB[pm:A]C[I think A would be better, since it puts more pressure 
on the black group, and gives you more influence in 
the area.];B[pm];W[cj]C[it seemed like this was a good place to try to invade... 
not too many of his stones around, so I might be able 
to get some territory here...

Perhaps a white stone 2 spots up or 2 spots down 
instead would have put more pressure on his stones.];B[bp]C[and then he goes and invades my corner.... I think I should have been watching out more....]
;W[br]LB[cq:A][cl:B][en:C]C[I think A would have been better, the current white 
stone does very little in the corner and protects very 
little area.  A follow up stone might go at B or C, you 
could even go one lower then B.];B[cq]LB[en:A]C[now black has entered your area, and salvagin eye 
space will be difficult, a run to the center at A might be 
what is needed to save these stones.];W[cr];B[cp];W[bl]LB[en:A]
C[This stone is good since it threatens this small black 
group.  However, a black stone at A would be bad for 
your local group, since it would connect both black 
groups and cut off your white group.];B[cm];W[cl]LB[en:A]C[This stone is not needed when you can place a stone 
at A.];B[em];W[ek];B[el];W[dl]LB[cg:xx][ch:A][gk:B][le:C]C[This stone does very little, ask yourself what its trying 
to accomplish, if its to defend, then I think you could 
fend off any black stones in that area. You could 
instead use that stone to place in more important 
spots.  Such as A, B or C. B and C are good for 
expanding your influence in the center. Although 
people say theres no territory in the center, at this 
point in the game you need to get some territory.];B[en];W[ch]
C[I really don't understand why he did all that just now.. I 
think it was to save the three stones in the corner... but 
I was a bit to preoccupied with my territory on the 
side...];B[aq];W[ar];B[fs]

;W[mi];B[gg];W[kk];B[lj]LB[mj:A]C[Your next stones attempt to contain, however he gets 
out anyways, I would suggest a stone at A to block 
black, as it forces him to go down to escape, down is 
good I think since you have some white stones in the 
area.];W[lk];B[mj];W[nk];B[nj];W[ok];B[oj];W[oh];B[pk];W[ol]
;B[pi];W[ph];B[qh];W[pf];B[qg];W[qc]C[this was a desperate move... I saw that I felt that I was 
extremely behind, so I was trying to take some 
territory away from him...

This is a good time as ever to attempt to invade, since 
any more stones will just make it more difficult then it 
already is.];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[rb];W[qb]
;B[pb];W[qa];B[sb];W[se];B[sf]LB[sc:A]C[I think it was here, that I was really really trying to 
figure out a way to live... after a while it seemed like it 
was dead,

A white stone at A would give you 2 eyes, however this 
would probably turn into a ko fight as black would put 
this white stone into atari, however it would be worth it 
to try.];W[oe];B[pe];W[of];B[sc]C[however after he played there I wasn't all too sure.... 
maybe if I had  moved there before I might have been 
saved...

yeah];W[rc];B[pa];W[fh];B[ko];W[lo];B[kp];W[lq];B[km];W[lm]

way I look at it, it seemed like I lost....

Yes, black does appear to have more territory, some 
things about this game I noticed.  most of your stones 
were reactions to blacks stones, I think you should be 
more aggresive. Also, you need to look at the big 
picture, I saw many of your stones which did very little 
when there were much bigger moves. Good game 
though. A go proverb says, lose your first 100 games.])
