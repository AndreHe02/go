C[Hi Jon:

    I'm CT and I will do my best to answer your questions. This is my first review so it may be a learning experience for us both. I will preface my comments with 'CT:'.



White [6k\]: hi.
Black [6k\]: hi];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq]
(;W[pj]C[CT: It is more customary to make a aplitting invarsion on the third line to be able to make a base inside the opponent's area.]
;B[ql];W[qf];B[qh]C[CT: Rather than invading the corner I would play a one point jump.One of the Black stones would then be unhappy.]
(;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od]C[CT: It is better not to push from behind.]
(;W[oc];B[nd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[jp];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb]
;W[ob];B[sd];W[sc];B[na];W[pa];B[lc];W[dj]C[CT: I like your position here. White is much faster with stones played at key points around the board while all of Black's stones are on the right side.]
;B[cn]C[CT: When Black invades your Sanrensei formation like this the customary response is to attach to his stone and then make a one point jump. See variation.]
(;W[cp]SQ[dp]LB[ep:A]C[CT: This doesn't put as much pressure on Black and implies that your 4-4 stone is in the wrong place. If you had played the triangle stone first would you have considered playing the square stone, or would you have played at A instead?]
;B[qb];W[rb];B[ra];W[qa];B[bj]C[I had problems with this invasion. I reasoned that if I could contain it, then I could build a wall for outside influence and make use of that, but I think I was too permissive.

CT: One way to meet the slide of B10 is to  play straight down attaching to his stone. See note.]
(;W[cl];B[bl]C[CT: I prefer White C9 here to keep the stones connected and then taking sente to take the last big point at the top.]
(;W[cm];B[bm];W[dn];B[bo]C[CT: Black's last move doesn't threaten your life and he can always escape towards the top. I think now would be a good time to play on the right, trying to activate your stones in that area.]
(;W[bp];B[ci];W[di];B[lp]SQ[oq]TR[jp]LB[ko:B][ph:A]C[This second invasion was also problematic. I think I made the mistake here, where I should have played towards the center to make use of the stones on the left for territory and attempt to rescue stones on the right.

CT: This isn't really an invasion. The area between the two marked stones hasn't been staked out by anyone until now. Your move seems fine to me. If you want to concentrate on the center instead of the bottom you could try playing at either A or B.]
(;W[kq];B[hp]LB[jn:A]C[CT: I try to avoid contact moves like this one. They usually help the opponent's invading stones to get stronger. Maybe something like the variation would be better.]
(;W[gq];B[hq];W[gp];B[ho];W[lq];B[mp];W[mq];B[nq];W[jn];B[hm]
;W[jl];B[hk]LB[ij:A]C[CT: Black is not threatening to make a base so I don't think J2 is necessary. I would contiue the attack with A. The best thing you can do for your stones on the right is to insure that they have somewhere to run to.]
;W[ir];B[hr];W[gr];B[gs];W[fs];B[hs];W[er]C[CT: This is one of the reasons that care should be taken before making a contact play, Black got sente.]
;B[jj]C[CT: Your group seems healthier. Cutting and fighting as in the variation would be more interesting.]
(;W[mm];B[hi];W[gj];B[hj];W[mk];B[nk];W[nj];B[nl]
(;W[ml];B[mj];W[ni];B[lj];W[om];B[ol];W[pl]
(;B[pk];W[pm];B[qk];W[nm];B[ok];W[qm]C[At this point I figure the four stones are pretty much done for. Attempt to play on the top to take advantage while threatening the connection of black's large, eyeless group.

CT: Black's group in the center is only eyeless if the upper right quadrant isn't entirely his. This is beginning to look like a possiblity.]
;B[qj]C[CT: It is probably better to play a more conservative extension but your move shows fighting spirit.]
