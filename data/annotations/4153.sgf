C[z -- hello, I'm Bill, "zinger" in the internet Go world and black in this game.  My comments are marked with "z --".

z -- I'm submitting this game for review because it was close and interesting.  Unfortunately, in the end I had to leave before the game was done (darn that real life).  I'm particularly interested in your thoughts about the situation on the right side where each player had a weak group.  I think that such situations are critical in the balance of power.  Of course, any and all comments are welcome, including white's play.

z -- thank you for your time and effort.

d -- Hi, this is Wang Dingwei reviewing. Since you've marked your comments with "z", I'll mark my comments with "d" ;-)

d -- The fuseki ended up even for both. In the midgame b didn't handle w's invasion well, w was ahead a bit, but w's invasion at the bottom side only strengthened b and gave b more points, which made it an even game again.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[od]SQ[pn][qn][po][qo]C[z -- a fuskei I use from time to time.  My intent is to provoke a kakari around the marked area, then play a pincer and develop the top right.]
;W[qk]C[z -- but white has his own ideas.];B[qi];W[qn];B[qp]
LB[jc:A]C[z -- during the game I thought this was the only move, but maybe A would have been better.

d -- R4 is a two-purpose move: 1, it gets the corner territory; 2, it makes w's two stones weaker so b can attack later. 

d -- next variation is from O Meien 9p's book "How to Attack Nikkentobi" O Meien often has some cool thoughts to show us.]

(;W[lc];B[fq];W[jp];B[cn];W[dn]
(;B[do]LB[dm:D][co:A][eo:B][cp:C]C[z -- not joseki, but I felt like experimenting.  The ladder from white A - black D favors black, so I figured, why not?  But maybe white could have done better.

d -- There are josekis like this. See in the coming variation.]
;W[eo];B[co];W[ep]
(;B[cp];W[cq];B[bq];W[dr];B[cr];W[dq]C[z -- this result seemed OK ...]

(;B[dl]SQ[ck][dk][cl][dm]C[z -- ... I just had to decide which point to move out on.  Would one of the marked points be better?

d -- See in variation.];W[gp]
(;B[cf]C[d -- Wrong direction. See in variation.];W[fd];B[bd]
;W[cc];B[ci]LB[dh:A]C[z -- perhaps this should have been at A, but I thought that would invite white to invade on the star point eventually.

d -- If b goes A, w can invade at D10, so c11 is the only choice for b.]
;W[id]C[d -- W has controlled the 4th line of the top side. It's bigger than b's left side. Also, because w gets thicker , w can invade in the right side easily.]
;B[lq];W[no];B[mp]C[z -- white's last move struck me as odd.  I thought that this response secured territory and kept access to the center.  Was there a better move?

d -- N4 is ok. Otherwise w will invade at o3 and isolate b m3. The exchange eliminates w's invasion at o3, good for b.]
;W[pc]
(;B[oc]C[d -- This move makes the game much more complicated....]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[pf]C[z -- white's last three moves seemed like a nice combination.  Was there a better response?]
;B[pd];W[nf];B[og];W[of];B[md]C[z -- maybe I should move out with the weak group instead, but in the game I thought that letting white connect to the top would be too easy on him.]
;W[mh];B[ni];W[nk]LB[mi:A]C[z -- I was more worried about white A.  But then white's lower group might become weak, so maybe it would be OK.]

;B[ke]C[z -- still trying to split white.];W[lf];B[jc]C[z -- this just didn't work.]
;W[jd]LB[kc:A][kd:B][ld:C][le:D]C[z -- I had expected A-B-C-D next, and thought I would have enough profit to win.  But now I realized that instead, A-C-B-D would happen, which would be terrible.  So ...

d -- This is interesting, see in variation.]
(;B[le]TR[jc][jd]C[z -- ... I went back to do this.  The marked enchange looks bad now.]
;W[kd];B[ng];W[mg];B[me];W[mf];B[il];W[nr]C[z -- not sure what white was up to down here.

d -- strange, and doesn't work.];B[np];W[qc];B[rd];W[nb]C[z -- this was annoying to me.]

(;B[eh]C[d -- Wrong. See in variation.];W[dm];B[cl];W[jj]C[z -- surely, I thought, after this there must be a way for black to connect to the bottom.  But I didn't find it.]
;B[kn];W[lo]LB[lp:A]C[z -- after this, A is sente for white any time, which made it hard for me to do much.]

(;B[kl]LB[nh:A][pi:B]C[z -- in the game I wasn't sure if I had time to protect the connection on the right.  But now it looks like A or B would connect and maintain a half-eye there.

d -- B is right. See in variation.];W[dg];B[cg];W[pi]C[z -- this was huge !]
;B[nh];W[qh];B[ro]C[z -- groups are all settled, so it's endgame now.  I'm working on this phase, so comments would be good throughout, even though this one got cut short.]

;W[af]C[z -- at this point, I had to quit the game to attend to another commitment.  I expect my opponent was surprised at my sudden resignation.  Disappointing, since it seems so close, and more so since a win might well have pushed me up to 2k.  But no matter: ranks will come eventually, if I deserve them.
