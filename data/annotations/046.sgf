[pn]C[pem: Perfectly playable, if somewhat  defensive. With the Q10 stone in place a pincer at M3 would be more  aggressive.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[do]C[pem: In the normal joseki Black would now have played R10, but with Q10  already in place, he can tenuki, but the right side is instead not secure  territory.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dm];W[fp]C[pem: The basic joseki is to play F3 here, I believe.]

(;B[cg]C[pem: This is too far from the three stones in the lower left  corner.  (See variation for the basic joseki.) Playing this far, one could  as well play C14. After White F4, however, maybe E5 or F5 is a possibility?]
;W[en];B[em]C[pem: Peeps are usually forcing moves. One  should try to resist when possible, but in this case I think White gains too  much. Actually, E5 is better than E7.]
;W[dn]C[pem: White gets nice  shape and has a cutting point at C7.];B[fn]
;W[eo]
(;B[fo]C[pem: Black now has two cutting points to defend. I think defending  the C7 point directly would be better. Another alternative woul be to extend  to G6 instead in which case White cannot cut at F7.
(See variations of this move.)];W[dp];B[cm];W[fm];B[gm];W[fl]
(;B[hn]C[pem: This is an awkward  situation. It allows White to force Black into a bad shape. The alternatives  all have their weaknesses. (See variations of this move.)]
;W[go];B[gn];W[fj];B[dj];W[gp];B[jn];W[eh]C[pem: This might induce Black to play D12 (as he did), but  then the knight's jump can be cut (which happened).]

;B[ei];W[fi];B[fh];W[gh];B[fg];W[ff];B[gg];W[hh];B[hg];W[ih]C[pem: Maybe H10 for eye-shape would be better for White in this  pressed situation.]
;B[gk];W[fk];B[hj];W[hi];B[jj]C[pem: The last Black stones have been good moves. They keep  White's eyeless group on the run while building strength.]

;B[ie];W[jf];B[le];W[ki];B[ji];W[mg];B[ne];W[pg]C[pem: An  overplay by White, I think. Making eyes for the central group is more urgent.]
;B[qh]C[pem: Too defensive. It should be possible, perhaps with some  preparatory moves, to separate White's Q13 from the center.]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[oh]C[pem: Dangerous, because...];B[oi]C[pem: ...Black should cut at P13 instead.]

;W[lf]C[pem: White must play this, or he will be cut off. Black now  has sente.]
;B[me]C[pem: Not sente, not urgent.];W[mk]C[pem:  Good move by White, where Black should have played.]
;B[nk];W[nj];B[oj]C[pem: P9 better.];W[nl];B[mj]C[pem:  Not gaining anything. P9 better here as well.]

;W[or];B[po]C[pem:  This is small. The lower right corner will live, the center is still weak.]
;W[jp];B[jo];W[jq];B[kn];W[lo];B[ko];W[op];B[pq]C[pem: Letting White capture is  worth 2 points in gote for White. Larger end-game moves are A15, G18, and B6.]

[sh]C[pem: A fairly close game this far, Black perhaps a  few points ahead.]
;W[km];B[jl]C[pem: The simple move is  just to block at K7, and Black's center group lives.]
;W[jm];B[in];W[gl];B[hl];W[im];B[hm];W[ij];B[kl];W[lm];C[pem: Overall, I think Black has a  tendency to get bad shape which leads to vulnerable open triangles and  cutting points. He is also easily induced to defending unimportant (single)  stones in atari, when there are larger moves to be made.]

(;B[ho]C[pem: Black  can get good shape at either H7 or H6. However...]

(;B[ci]C[pem: This is however still invadable.  White can invade at C8. Black  can reinforce the formation (usually later) by playing at E11.]
