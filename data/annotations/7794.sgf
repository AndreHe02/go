C[N: hello, in the game you helped your opponent to construct a moyo, which gave him enough points to win the game. During the game and in the variations you addad, I got the impression you have a tendency for solid, slow moves. This is not necessarily bad, but at some point you have to use this. And after a while solid can become just slow, this way, slowly you get behind. I would guess that your fastest way to improve is to learn play more sabaki, more loose moves at times.

I deleted several variations to keep an oversight and kept only those where i added comments.
Questions or comments are welcome.

My comments are preceded by N:

N: your reasoning and reading is correct, one should push until a block is no longer sente, however in this case i think you had a better alternative. Here you are pushing the chart from behind and getting each push only one point.]

(;W[cj]LB[jd:A][nq:B]C[N: i tink this is not correct. The left side is the preferred direction of development for the white shimari. However, the right side very much aims at an extention to the top side. To me it seems obvious that this is bigger then the left side.]

What you should do in such a situation is guessing, or make a evaluation and see if you can still win the game by making the safer move (the game move). If this is not the case, you better play all-or nothing.]
