hi i'm k43r and i'll review your game.

Usually it's better to play away from strong positions. Better ideas from a to g. Again i'd play A.]
;B[dq];W[jq]LB[dq:A]C[Black stone d3 (marked as A) is really strong. Black can safely attack those two lonely white stones. He won't suffer any demage from it in his corner. k3 move leaves huge hole at h3. It's perfect spot to attack!

When opponent has strong position, you can't leave him places to use that strenght!]

;W[ge]C[This capture was probably not necessary... Ilost a move to do it. But I think it also kept black from making a more secure shape with P5.
