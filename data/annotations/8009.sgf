C[Dear reviewer,
thank you for the time you'll spend on my game.
It was a fast game, but not blitz, 10 minutes for 25 stones, which I think I lost in yose, after a lot of fighting oppurtunity.
Of course, I would like to get from you any kind of idea, but most of all I'm now studying direction of play, shapes, and tesuji.
I've added some ideas of my own, principally because I was commenting the game for an italian guy who is learning go from me, unlucky boy, so those comments are in italian, but I'm sure you can realize what we were talking about even without translation.
Thanks again for your work.
Carlo, Hobbes on KGS

-Svante-:  Hi, I am your reviewer.  This is an interesting and unconventional game.  I hope you do not mind that, in order to focus on the game, I have removed some deep branches you added and also the italian comments.]
