C[Hi,



Here is a game I lost recently, mainly due to my poor positionnal judgement. I thought I was behind from the begining, but after self-review, it looked quite close until I lost a corner.



I would like to know if my self review is correct,and added a few questions in the game.

Any other comments are also greatly appreciated !



Thanks for your time,

Vincent.

J: Hi, my name is Jay and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments start with "J:".]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc]C[I enclosed this corner first because of the facing hoshi.]
;W[pj];B[qn];W[qf];B[ne]MA[jq][fq][cj]C[The first mistake ? It should have been near K17

J: Yes, it does seem a bit early for plays on the fifth line.  Also consider the extension of k3, approach of f3, and the splitting attack of c10.]
;W[jd];B[ph]MA[cf][fq][jp]C[J: This feels a little early, play bigger moves first.  The weak point in this white shape is r12, and q12 builds influence that is hard to use because k16 is already there.

Maybe a somthing like c14 to prevent a double wing.  or any of the moves i noted earlier...]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[qg];B[pf]C[J: q14 is slow and unnecessary.  There is actually very little weakness there.  Even if it was cut off, you can consider q12 and q13 to be light stones that may be sacrificed.]
;W[kp]C[J: White is very happy to keep black's extension from the lowerright in check here.]
;B[cj]C[J: Timely.];W[dl]MA[cm]C[J: C6/C7 is normal here for white: puts more pressure on black.  A high move here allows an open skirt into which black can jump.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[ef]
(;W[dg]MA[fd]C[This looks like an overplay, but maybe it is right and my previous move was weak ?

J: this peep is probably an over play.  D8 is not a in position to attack black's group. See variation for a simpler way to resolve here.

The problem whit is peep is that it strengthens black's e14 stone.  He can then use that later as a platform to reduce the top with f16.]
;B[df];W[di];B[dj];W[fh];B[ch];W[dh];B[cg]C[J: White has gained nothing but a weak group.]
;W[ci]C[J: This pointless push must be omitted.];B[bi];W[nq]
;B[ej]C[A thank-you move : i gain nothing and white fixes his shape.

J: It's ok if you use it correctly.  See variation.];W[fi]
(;B[np]C[J: a thankyou move for white.  The black influence you gain here faceing north is worthless because q10 is there.]
;W[mq];B[op];W[dq]C[J: White should protect f16 first, and not be afraid of the 3-3 invasion.]
;B[cn]C[J: this invasion seems a little deep.  unless you treat this stone as light, and ready to sacrifice it.  It would be easier to reduce from b8 later.]
;W[bk];B[ck];W[cl];B[bj];W[bm];B[ak]C[J: endgame move.];W[en]
;B[bl];W[cm];B[qk]C[It's a nice extension, but it's also a reversed shoulder hit. Is this ok ?

J: it's fine since you're aiming to cut the r11 weakness.  My only worry about this move is that if white gets to play stones on the 4th line, his bottom moyo will grow too big.]
;W[qj];B[pk];W[ok];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[rk];B[rl];W[pi];B[nk]
;W[ol];B[rj];W[ri];B[sk];W[ni];B[mm];W[nl];B[ml];W[li];B[om]
C[Would protecting the cut directly be better ?

J: Yeah, something like m9.];W[mk];B[mj];W[lj];B[lk];W[mi];B[mk]
;W[le];B[iq]C[J: this feels a little too deep, a reduction will be easier.  k5 shoulder hit may be a good start.]
;W[gq];B[io];W[kn];B[lo]C[J: why peep here, you're only making white's wall stronger.]
;W[ko];B[im];W[kl];B[kk];W[in]C[This move surprised me. Was there a better way than what i've played ?]
;B[hn];W[ho];B[jn];W[jm];B[jl];W[jo]C[J; black should fill here to simplify the situation.]
(;B[km];W[ip];B[hp];W[in];B[gf]C[I thought reducing the top was better that connecting the ko at K7, and did not find any better threat. Was it right ?

J: G14 isn't a very convicing reduction.    Considering you've spent about 7 moves at the bottom reducting, is this reduction worth losing 7 moves?]
;W[jm];B[ll];W[hm];B[jn];W[gn];B[gk]C[I wanted to attack the D12 group, I didn't get many benefits, so this was probably another mistake.

J: actually, white will be ahead on territory if he simply sacifices the f11 group and protects f16.]
;W[hj];B[gj];W[hh];B[gi];W[gh];B[ji];W[jh];B[hi];W[kh];B[ih]
;W[ig];B[ii];W[hf];B[fd];W[eb];B[ec];W[dc];B[fb];W[ed];B[fc]
;W[cb];B[ea]C[Another error, I think that white does not need to answer.

J: correct.];W[db];B[ic];W[jc];B[he];W[id];B[hd];W[ie];B[mc]
;W[md];B[nd];W[mb];B[lc]C[Was it better to block at O18 ?

J: This resistance is good.];W[lb];B[kc];W[kb];B[ib];W[jb];B[nb]
;W[ia];B[hb];W[fj];B[fk];W[il];B[jm];W[rd]C[This is where I lost the corner and the game. I don't know how to respond to this move. R17 feels prudent, but small.]
;B[rc];W[qe]
(;B[pe]C[J: wrong move here, see variation.];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb]
;B[pd];W[rb];B[ng];W[mf];B[nf];W[oh];B[og];W[oe];B[pb]C[Only yose moves left. You can stop here if you're in a hurry.

J: hmm, I don't think black is alive here...... see variation.]
(;W[ln]MA[or][be]C[J: at this point, i think the biggest points on the board are here.]
;B[mn];W[mo];B[no];W[mp];B[hl];W[gl];B[ik];W[be];B[bf];W[af]
;B[ag];W[ae];B[bc];W[bb];B[ce];W[bd];B[ac]C[Hasty move, white is already alive.]
;W[da];B[fl];W[oq]C[J: weird, p2 is normal... q2 might work too.

This is my last comment.  A key takeaway from this game is knowing when to attack in the opening.  You spent a lot of moves in the top right for very little gain while white was expanding his influenece all around the board.

Also learn this proverb: "A reduction is worth as much as an invasion."  We see that the bottom could have been a easy reduction for black with very little risk instead of the deep j3 invasion.

Thank you for showing me this game.];B[pr];W[or];B[gm];W[fm]
