(;B[qd]C[Katt3n note: Is this stone doomed to produce a weak result?

Well, people do invade like this sometimes, usually because either a) They can go two ways with it (i.e. either escape to the corner or side) or b) they want to confuse or intimidate a weaker player with an oddly placed stone.  This is an attack / invasion move though, and it's way too early for that.  See variations for the two moves I coulw recommend.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[qc];B[rd];W[qf];B[rc];W[qb]C[Katt3n note: I felt this gave my opponent a massive position top and was not liking the board at all.

That's because it did.  Your stone netted you at most 5 points of territory and he gets a huge wall.  Claiming only 5 points from this wall would be a massive failure.....he will probably get more like 20 haha.]
(;B[lj]C[Katt3n note: This stone proved usefull.

But it's still not good.  "Corner, side, middle"  You haven't taken care of either of the first two.]
(;W[ld]C[This move is lame by white, too close to his own big wall.  There is a saying I learned that says "Use walls to attack, not to make territory."]

(;B[pb]C[Katt3n note: Is it wrong choice made here? Picking the corner instead of fighting from P15 & Q15.

Well, you have to make this move or he will win the fight and as a consequence capture S16 too! (see variation)]
;W[rb];B[sb];W[sc]C[Hahah I love it when people throw in stones pointlessly xD.]
;B[sd];W[sf];B[qa];W[nf]
(;B[hd]C[Katt3n note: Felt this was needed to reduce the white influence here. Is the stone correctly placed?

White doesn't have much influence yet, this space you played in is wide open.  You could play almost anywhere in this area and live.  If it were me I would prevent the shimari (corner enclosure) on the top left (see previous variation).]

(;B[ke]C[Katt3n note: Should this be at M14?

No.....you need to keep connection, M14 is just inviting to be cut apart.]

C[Katt3n note: Is this stone worth more then playing at ex. K3?


absolutely not, this stone is almost worthless actually, white should just cut it off, see variation.  K3 and Q5 should have been played as soon as they were allowed.]

[ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Well, the key to advancing to higher levels is to begin to think globally.  Don't respond to your opponent's move unless it is absolutely vital.  Play moves that balance defense and offense, and play dual purpose moves whenever possible.  Keep in mind when attacking something to trap it first, don't try to kill it first.  If you seal it then fail to kill it, it will live but probably small with no room for expansion.  If you take away eyespace but then it escapes and lives, it's a bigger failure.  That wasn't really the case with this game but it's something to keep in mind.]
