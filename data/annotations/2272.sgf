C[I would like to know which part of my game I need to improve the most and if tehre was any different play I could have done in the upper left corner

Hi Adalberto,

I looked over your game, and I hope that my comments are useful for you. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to send me an email.

(;W[qf]C[This is very unusual, but it is playable, I guess (it has actually been played in a pro game, but only in one game out of 20.000 in the GoGoD database).]

(;B[qh]C[This is ok (it actually was the continuation in the pro game I mentioned; white then invaded the corner). R15 instead would also be good.]
;W[of]C[Invading the corner at R17 might be better because black is quite strong on the right side.]
;B[nc]C[Ok. O16 instead puts a little bit more pressure on the white stones and might thus be preferable.]
;W[qm];B[qo];W[rk]C[White is overplaying here. He creates two weak groups in blacks sphere of influence.]

(;B[fq]C[Black should answer on the right side. See the variation.]

(;W[hq]C[Same holds for white ...];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr]C[It is not necessarily good for black to exchange D2/C3, because as a consequence black loses the option to invade the corner at C3 instead. At some later point that might be preferable.]

(;B[cj]C[see the variation];W[dq];B[er];W[gp];B[fp];W[fs]C[This is very bad. White has no chance whatsoever to kill this group. He should instead play from the outside. If he can force black to defend he can be happy.]

(;B[gs]C[Similarly, black should just jump out. Defending is much too small now, since the black group is in no real danger, once it got out into the center.]
;W[hs]C[This move is pointless.];B[es]C[As is this one. Jumping out with F7 is still perfect for black.]

(;B[hn]C[Don't touch what you want to attack! As a general rule, play contact moves for defense, and attack from a distance. (The reason is that contact plays make both sides stronger, but here you do not want to strengthen white.)]

(;B[im]C[This connects two groups which were both alive anyway, and thus is not a very important move. It's much more important to take care of the D12 group now.]

(;B[je]C[Maybe black should try to invade instead. See the variation.]
;W[hc]C[Now it's probably too late to invade. Nevertheless, if black just reduces the white territory from the outside, he will win.]

(;B[cc]C[I don't think that black can live here. Just reducing the white territory is good enough for black. If black wanted to invade, he should have done so before the K15/H17 exchange which stabilized the white territory very much.]

[rq][rr][rs][sa][sb][sc][so][sp][sq][sr][ss]C[Summarizing, what I would recommend to concentrate on in order to improve are these two things:

- Keep an eye on which groups are weak and which are strong. On the right side, white created two weak groups, and black missed the chance to strengthen his group in between those two. Black could have got a strong attack here.

- On a related note, always consider jumping out into the center instead of living small on the edge, when you have to defend one of your groups. When whte played F1, black should just have jumped out into the center; this would almost have been a free move for black.

Good luck!])
