C[I am a novice Go player though I have been at it for a year. While this is a 13x13 game where I play Black, I very much would like help with White's invasion and why I was eaten alive there. Please note my rank is based on 1 19x19 game on KGS.

I would like help with moves 42 - 87 where I was first invaded by white
and defended very poorly.  Apparently I made the same error over and
over.

Eric:  The problem that you faced here was all due to playing too loosely during the opening game.  Your lower side was open for invasion for most of the game.  As a contrast, look at white's opening which is very safe and very strong (possibly too slow, though).  The second problem came after you were invaded and tried to kill the invasion instead of contain it.  What you should have done at varying points in the defense was to let the pressure off of white a little, and take a step back (jump one space from the advancing white position).  What you wanted to do was to allow white to live, but minimize the territory lost.]
;B[kj];W[jc];B[ej];W[dc];B[ci]C[This whole opening is fine on both sides, though I would say that your enclosure on the lower left is a bit too loose.  White could easily invade on the 3-3 point.  C-4 may be safer.]
;W[ce];B[kg];W[ke];B[hi]C[This is played too high.  At this point, your position is inviting an invasion somewhere on the lower side (such as j3, c3, or g3). Both of your corners were very loose before this move, so playing this move high doesn't help to secure your lower side.  A better move here would be h3 or j3.]
;W[gc]C[After move 9, white did not invade for a while, so you should have taken one move somewhere to secure your lower side (j3 perhaps). As a contrast, white's position on the top is very secure.  He has played low, on the third line, and can later safely expand. Your position needs reinforcement, though this is ok, because you have already sectioned off more territory.]
;B[cg];W[ef]C[GoJimGo [?\]: Where are you from?

Eric:  This is a good move for white.  Agaian, though, the real profit right now is in invading the lower side.]
;B[eg];W[ff];B[fg];W[gf]C[White could have jumped one space to h8 instead here.  Black, on the next move, could have instead safely jumped to h7.  But this is ok.]
;B[gg];W[hf];B[hg]C[19 should be at j7 instead, getting you one step ahead.]
;W[if]C[Suiren [?\]: holland and you?];B[jf];W[je];B[ig];W[kf]
;B[jg];W[ie]C[White didn't have to connect here.  M7 or an invasion of the lower side would have been better.]
;B[lf];W[le];B[mf];W[me];B[lg]C[This sequence was played correctly, but at this point it is more important for you to secure your lower side from invasion.  That sequence is worth 4 points, but the risk of invasion (as you know) is worth more.]
;W[df];B[dg];W[bg];B[bh]C[GoJimGo [?\]: Oklahoma, US];W[bf]
;B[ag];W[cf]C[White doesn't really need to connect here.];B[ai]
C[This move is not necissary.  Again, this move should have been used to secure your lower side.  If the lower side had been secure, this should have been used at A8, to get one point.]
;W[af];B[ck]C[This is good.];W[kl]C[White first invades.

Eric: Yikes!  This is just about the scariest thing that can happen.]
;B[kk]C[At this point, you need to decide whether you are going to try to kill the invasion or if you are going to let it live, but minimize it.  My feeling is that white can fairly easily make life here, so you want to minimize the gain.  You want to keep white low, so I would suggest here either k3 or m3, depending upon which direction you want to push white.  These moves make it so that white's follow up moves have to be on the second line.]
;W[lk]C[This is a mistake.  White should have gone towards the lower center.]
;B[km]C[My first error.  I should have played at k-2.

Eric: Yes.  You would have been able to kill this group.];W[lm]
;B[ml]C[I, B, tried to block white from living in the corner with two eyes at n-1 and m-2.

Eric:  Yes, that is good, but at this point, white will be able to make more eyes on the left.  It is more important here to work at boxing white in.]
;W[jm];B[lj]C[My next error not blocking W from moving out into the center, but playing at m-4.

Eric:  Yes, I would play J2.];W[jl]C[White should have moved faster towards the center.  This move allows you more time to box white in.]
;B[mk]C[My
play at n-3 shows how obsessed I was with preventing W from living in
the corner while W was easly working out toward the center eating up my
territory.  I also left open W's chance to make an eye at l-1.

Eric:  Yes.  H2 is my suggestion.  Maybe H3.];W[ll];B[mj]C[n-4 saved 2 stones while allowing W to get stronger toward the left where I should have been blocking her.

Eric: This move wasn't actually needed.  The stones can still be saved later, when white threatens them.  It would be better to use this move to stop white's expansion.]
;W[il];B[hl]C[Reviewer, I know something is bad about my move to h-2, but what?

Eric:  This stone doesn't have much help around, in this case. White can immediately threaten it on the next move by playing at H3, then you must play G2.  It is best to leave one space (G2 is the better move), so that your stone does not have one liberty taken away initially.]
;W[hk]C[GoJimGo [?\]: You are doing a good job of eating up my space.]
;B[ik]C[G2 is required.];W[gl]C[Suiren [?\]: sorry, i am trying to learn too]
;B[gk];W[hm];B[gm]C[Reviewer, here I, B, thought I was cutting W, not putting a stone in the tiger's mouth.

Eric:  Yes, this is bad.  You should haved played H4.];W[hl]
C[White should have taken.];B[fl]C[This is weak.  White can later get F2 and G3 in a double atari and break right through this wall.]
;W[fm];B[em]C[Too thin.  White can do a ton of damage by playing at F3.]
;W[jk];B[ij];W[jj];B[ji];W[ki];B[kh]C[The move here to l-6 should have been to h-4 to put a cap on W's options.  The diagonal on W's left is week though.

Eric:  Yes.  H4 is good.  Something like F4 or E3 may be even better.]
;W[hj];B[ii]C[This move should have been at g-4 to block in W.]
;W[gj];B[fi]C[This move to f-5 is perhaps my first decent move.

Eric:  Yes, this is a very good move here.  Taking a step back to stop white's adavance is good gameplay.  White will take one more piece, but will be contained.]
;W[fk];B[el];W[fj];B[ek];W[gi];B[gm]C[Instead of taking the Ko at g-1 I, B, should have blocked W at g-6.

Eric: Yes.];W[gh];B[fh];W[fm];B[hh];W[gm];B[li]C[You don't need to take this stone until white forces you to.]
;W[ah];B[tt]C[You could have played around in white's territory (C12, C11, B11) instead of passing if you wanted.  If white had responded, you could take the ko.]
