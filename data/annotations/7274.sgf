C[Hello,

thank you for taking the time to review my game. Some mistakes I think I have already found in a walk-through after the game. I would appreciate if you could check these and further give some general comments on the game from a stronger players perspective.

Daniel (om3)

inimino: Hello Daniel, I will enjoy reviewing this game.];B[qd]

(;B[cc]LB[cc:A][nc:B]C[om3: Probably this was much too greedy and I should've taken sente at O17 or around, to stop W from extending there... ? Now I think, this might already have been one of the main mistakes in the game, since the next move for W was really huge.....

inimino: I wouldn't call this greedy but it seems a little small for this time in the game.  However I do not think it is such a terrible mistake.]
;W[od]
(;B[oc]LB[oc:A][pf:B]C[om3: was this a wrong choice of joeki? would it be better to play q14 to not strengthen w too much here?

inimino: I do not think so.

I think this is a good choice, however, at our level the game is very rarely decided in fuseki... so I think you can afford to make some mistakes here.

In any case you can keep some corner this way and it seems to me better than the variation.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jd];B[ng]C[om3: not really a conventional move, but i thought i had to do something to keep the W moyo under control...

inimino: I think you worry too much here.  I agree this looks like a bad move but before this move, the game is at least even, maybe even some advantage to b.

So w has some few points at the top, so what?  B has points in at least two corners, and sente, so ...

I would play reasonably here and not panic.

C6 or so looks OK, or R5, something reasonable and measured.  This exaggerated move looks as if you are worried too much about a few points when the game is still even.]
;W[po];B[qm];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[nq]C[om3: I didn't know how to react here.

inimino: This is fairly common, and can lead to some tricky plays.  The standard response is the natural move you played.]
;B[op];W[on];B[np];W[pl];B[qk];W[ql];B[rl];W[pm];B[rm];W[ck]
C[inimino: This is a very big move, I think much bigger than the move b played at O13.]

(;B[cj]LB[dh:C][ci:B][cj:A]C[om3: w didnt exploit it, but still I wonder if this leaves probably too much aji. I thought of d11 or d12 as an alternative.

inimino: Yes, this move seems awkward and helps w more than b in my opinion.  I would prefer D12 also if you do play here.  Another alternative could be to ignore this for the moment and play around F3.]
;W[dk];B[fq];W[hq];B[cq]C[inimino: I disagree with this move.  This is the move, more than any other, in my opinion, that led to w having a large center and a losing game for b.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[inimino: I think I would play B6 here instead.  Otherwise, w can more easily close off the center in sente.]
;W[kq];B[rr];W[ei];B[dh];W[eh]C[om3: I was quite happy after this sequence. My weakness was fixed and i got sente.

inimino: However, compare this to the position around move 45 and I think you will see that w has gained a lot.]
;B[pk];W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[nj];W[mj]
(;B[dn]LB[mi:B][dn:A]C[om3: maybe it was not such a good idea to tenuki here?

inimino: I think N11 is bigger, but you are also creating a wall for w here with these last few moves.  I'm not sure about the strategy of these last few moves...  at move 61 I would prefer P10 for example.  I don't like the pushing, contact play all the time of these last few moves.]
;W[en];B[fr];W[fp];B[es];W[gq];B[lp];W[mi]
(;B[lq]LB[pi:B][lq:A]C[om3: according to my feeling, the second bad mistake of the game and the loosing move.

inimino: This is clearly a big mistake and I don't think b can recover from it.]
;W[pj];B[qj];W[pi];B[qh];W[qi];B[ri];W[ph];B[qg];W[pg];B[pf]
;W[mf]C[om3: here I realised that there is no way into w's territory, and that the game is probably lost.]

(;B[nh]LB[lg:B][nh:A];W[lg];B[dj]C[inimino: This reduces your liberties, and causes the problem you saw a few moves later.  It is sente, but not necessarily a good idea.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[bj];B[bi]C[om3: The last stupidity... actually, the game was played until the end, but i think that the rest is not worth analysing....

inimino: OK.  I will end the review here.  Please ask if you have any questions or let me know if I made any mistakes!  Thanks.]
