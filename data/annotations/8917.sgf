C[One of my biggest problems lately has been that when I play I feel that all my moves are kind of numb. Not aggressive enough and then in the end I lose with 10-20 points. This happens a lot. For example this I did win by 0.5 points but white did not have komi so actually I feel like I lost this.

Hello toomasr,
I'm Laurent Lam√¥le (lorl), 1k on KGS

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have additional questions.

My global analysis of the game :
1) I think your opening was not balanced : you play some slow moves when you could be more aggressive... but you also miss some reinforcements of your shapes which could prevent your opponent to take advantage.
2) After you invade the left upper corner, both players misread the situation, and you had some occasions to live..
(LL)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[qk]C[this is a perfectly playable opening.
(LL)];W[qf]C[many moves are possible here, but I feel this one is a bit strange ; playing in the narrow side.
white should better play in the wide side at O17, or, try to reduce black's framework at the bottom.
