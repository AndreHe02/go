C[Thanks for
letting me review your game.  It is always important to go back and
review basic principles of go, and helping weaker players is a great way
to do that, so feel free to email me some follow up questions or send me
more games.  You fell behind early, but showed some excellent moyo
instincts.  The losing move was probably M17.  Overall I think black got
away with playing low moves too much.  When your opponent plays all low,
don't attack him, just play elsewhere and see how much territory he can
construct on the third line!  - eggroll 2k*];B[pp];W[pd];B[dp]
;W[dd];B[fc]C[Unusual because it jumps right in to
where white is strong.  This gives white a target for attack
immediately.  more usual is K4 or C14];W[df]C[K17is probably better because it serves both as a pincer and an
ideal extension from the Q16 stone];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[ci]
C[C10 is the proper shape, but even C10 probably isn't
as good as R6

You should keep in mind that the idea behind D16 and D14 is influence,
not territory.  Black can invade at C13 any time.];B[nc]C[Look at how all of black's stones are on the third line on the
top.  This is bad and makes it hard for him to develop, so the thing to
do is ignore the top side and play elsewhere.

Because he is strong on the left, he should play away from his strength
at R14.];W[lc]C[KIO: i don't think this is the right thing to do. I was like
afraid of the big black territory on the top if i allowed a b m17.

Yeah, this is a bad idea, black is very strong on the top, but he can't
develop well, this gives him a chance to use his strength.  Let him take
territory on the top, it's not important.  Third line territory is no
big deal.  He is already overconcentrated.  Now is the time to play Q14 and you are happy.

Basic Prinicpal:  don't pincer if your opponent is strong in the
direction you are pincering.  Pincers start a fight and this is only
good for you if you are strong in the area.];B[qc]C[It is natural for
black to jump up to O15 and fight, I am not sure why he doesn't.  Usually people at your strength jump up way too often in this
situation.];W[nd]C[Not joseki, but i dont think that it is terrible.
(Joseki would be Q17 or R16)  Both of which would be bad for you in this
case, but I recommend learning because they are very straightforward and
*very* common.];B[oc];W[md];B[qd]C[I think that black should cut at P16,
this move forces you to strengthen your M17 group and doesn't take much
territory.];W[pe];B[qe];W[qf]C[feels like an overplay];B[qi]
C[ahh!  Black should
cut at Q14];W[og]C[KIO: too much aji. Q14 better?\]
Hard to say I think.  Maybe it is best to play elsewhere and sacrafice
the R14 stone.];B[ql]CR[ic][qi][fc]C[See how your thickness is nullified by black's
low stones.];W[cn]C[Good direction];B[co]C[Terrible!  There are only two reasons for this move.  One is because you are really
strong in the area and you want to make the opponent heavy so he can't
sacrafice his stones.  Two (very rare) is because your opponent is
*very* strong close to the stone on C6 and you think that you can
overconcentrait him.  In this case is just makes you strong for no
reason.];W[dn];B[fq];W[qq]C[Probably bad or too early.  If the R8 stone was at
R7 then this is fine, but in this case you can play O3.  I also like G15
which builds a huge moyo and threatens the F17 group.];B[qp]
C[should go
in the other direction.  Now the R8 stone will be too close and the R8
and R11 will be too
low.];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[nr]
;B[mq];W[cq]C[good, see what he does.  tough choice :)];B[cp]
;W[bq];B[dq];W[bo];B[bp];W[ap];B[cr]C[KIO: b6 only move.
B6 might work for black now even.];W[br];B[bn];W[ao]C[Just adding to your losses, if you play D2 now you can
live.];B[an];W[dr]C[good];B[ar];W[er]C[you must take then it will
probably be: A3, E2 F2 E1 B1, and it's a two step ko for you (meaning
black has to win it twice) so you should be
happy.];B[cs]C[trouble];W[bs];B[fr];W[eq];B[ep];W[fp];B[gp]
;W[fo];B[fs];W[bm];B[aq];W[dl];B[jq];W[lr];B[lq];W[kr];B[jr]
;W[go]C[G15
is getting bigger and bigger...];B[hp];W[ge]C[yes!  This move is so huge that I would say you still probably
have a good chance of winning.];B[fg]C[probably unreasonable. E11 might
be a good move for black. G11 would more relaxed.  He is very thick in
the lower right so he doesn't have to worry
much.];W[gc];B[gb];W[fd]C[good];B[ec];W[hc];B[hb]C[KIO: at this point i
felt like
i had a big moyo but i didn't know how to chase f13, in which direction
to go.

That was a nice sequence you played, really punished black for F13 which
is now obviously way too close to your wall. H13is probably a good move,
chase him in yo your strong lower left. You will probably have to kill
him to win after losing the lower left and getting bad results in both
right side corners.  But it looks possible];W[id]C[This may be even
better than my suggestions :)];B[hg]C[But you had better be prepared for
this move.  Still you are really strong.  Very tough position for both
sides.];W[gh]C[seems good];B[gg];W[jg]C[KIO: wouldn't have j11 been much
better,
building influence in yhe center and chasing f13 towards q16?

It probably would have been better, but you are strong in the lower left
too.];B[ih];W[jh];B[ii];W[kk]C[Too loose.  What about K10?]
;B[ik];W[in];B[kj];W[jj];B[jk];W[lj];B[ij];W[ki]C[letting you get that ponnuki is terrbile for
black];B[jm];W[jn];B[kn];W[lm]C[Bad.  The cut doesn't work now, but
there is a lot of aji.  You should try and force black on the right side
to get influence so the cut will work.  This peep is nearly worthless.  (Blacks low stones nullify your thickness.)]
;B[km];W[kl];B[im];W[ln];B[ko];W[oj]C[probably not enough to
