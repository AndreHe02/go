C[Hello reviever!
This is the game I played after veeery long break, so there are few stupid mistakes in the beginning, but generally it was ok. I have a lot of questions, so thanks in advance for answering them :)

****
Hello, I am CaNilsen on KGS, 4k.
If you have any question you can ask me on aresdesign@live.no or on KGS under the nickname CaNilsen

This game was very different from what I play, also I got a very aggressive playing style.
It was a good game, while both of you made some game breaking mistakes.
There is a lot of variations added, please look over then and try to read for yourself while looking at the variations and study them.  There is some variations that is not important and my missclicks, so the variations with comments are the correct once.

My style is very dependent on the fact that my oponent don't get a lot of territory.  This game both of you get huge moyo starts.]
;B[pd]
(;W[dd]LB[dp:A]C[i.) I would not play here, the reason is that if you play at A black can not make a diagonal opening.
Also see variation.];B[ep]
(;W[pp]LB[cp:A]C[i.)Because of my agressive style I would played A instead talking corner with a Sente Joseki.
See Variation];B[dn];W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[jd];W[fc]
LB[cp:A][gp:C][cq:B][eq:E][gq:D]C[i.) This is still small I believe
ii.) In the start play on the most interesting side, also the most empty side
iii.) Playing A - E might be more interesting to stop black getting a big corner]
;B[hc];W[di]C[i.) This move is maybe not wrong, but with my playing style I would not play here as it helps black getting a very big corner]
;B[dk];W[jp]LB[cp:B][dq:C][gq:A]TR[qi][pp]C[i.) I believe playing A - C would been better
ii.) But now you have a wing, this is good.];B[hp];W[ir]LB[jj:A]
[qo:D][cp:B][cq:C]C[i.) This move is no good.

A - Tengen making a big scale moyo
B - Taking the corner from black
C - 3x3 Takes the corner from black
D - Passive move that secure the corner];B[pk]
(;W[qk]LB[oi:B][pm:C][qm:A]C[i.) Provb: "Do not attatch to weak stones, attack from distance."
ii.) Maybe playing A - C is better 
See Variation]
(;B[pn]C[i.) Lucky, black was nice]
(;W[qn]LB[qo:A]C[i.) Again you attatch to a weak stone. This is had habbit.]
;B[qo]
(;W[rn]C[i.) This is a very big mistake.
See variation];B[po];W[qp];B[ro];W[pm];B[qm]
(;W[ql]C[First stupid mistake x_x

***

Yes this was maybe a stupid mistake, but there have been bigger mistakes.]
;B[rm];W[rl];B[sn];W[pl];B[rp];W[rq];B[mp]
(;W[mq]C[i.) Again you attatch to a weak or single stone.
See Variation];B[lq]C[i.) Here you are lucky.];W[nq];B[lp];W[lr]
;B[kr];W[mr];B[jq];W[jr];B[jo];W[ks];B[kq];W[iq];B[ip];W[gq]
LB[cp:A][dq:B]C[i.) You do not want to continue jump here.
ii.) Jump dirrectly to A - B];B[hq];W[hr];B[gr];W[fr];B[gp]
;W[fq];B[fp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[dr];W[cr];B[dp];W[cq];B[cp]
;W[bq]LB[bp:A]C[i.) A is bigger but Gote];B[bp]
(;W[gs]C[I saw a problem with Black's K1 (unable to take G2-G1 group because of damezumari - I didn't saw simple D1 move), but after reviewing it I see that it was unnescessary.

*** Indeed];B[gi];W[fg];B[hg];W[ek]LB[cf:C][gi:D][ej:B][fj:A]
[gs:E]C[I had the idea of cutting black stones and/or gaining advantage on the left side, but I played it little to fast thinking that it has to be good. Too bad that I played it wrong. What would be better?

***

i.) You can play safer and play A or B
ii.) But maybe more important is to play C - Then you will later win on territory as in this game
ii.) Also if you want to reduce you sould reduced before the D stone. This would be possible if you did not do the E gote mistake.]
;B[ej];W[dj];B[fk];W[el];B[fl]LB[dh:A][eh:B][ck:C][cl:E][dl:D]
C[What you want to do now is:
i.) Read Read Read and Read Ahead
ii.) You have A - E

See Variations to understand how to analyse]
(;W[fj];B[ei];W[eh]LB[fi:A]TR[di][dj]C[I didn't play A instead because I wasn't sure if the marked stones will be ok.]
;B[fi];W[dl]LB[dh:A]C[i.) This is not save, as white allready have the aji at A, white did not have this aji in his group beforehand.]
;B[ck];W[cl];B[bl]
(;W[cj]C[This is a mistake in theory. As A will not be sente and black can cut.]
;B[bk];W[bm]LB[bj:A]C[I didn't see I was losing this semeai. A was certainly better.

***

i.) Yes since you allready have lost the group A is better]
;B[cm];W[al]LB[bj:A]C[i.) Again A is better];B[bn];W[bj];B[am]

(;W[no]LB[mm:A]TR[pl][pm]C[I wanted to cut the Black's group on the right side leaving it worth 3 points, but I'm not sure if it was really necessary. Maybe playing in the upper right part of the board (going to center) would be better.

***

i.) Playing A is better since you allready got help from your 2stone wall.]
;B[nn];W[on]LB[mo:A]TR[lp][mp][jq][kq][lq][kr]C[A looks much better and Black's group is in danger ;)

***];B[oo];W[om];B[np];W[op]C[Oops. I played completely wrong and finished in gote ;)]
;B[mm];W[mo]C[Unnecessary, isn't it?

***

Very, lost another move];B[lo]C[i.) Lucky that black answered.]
;W[ok];B[mk];W[ni];B[sp];W[rr]LB[lc:D][ld:C][nf:B][li:A]C[I think it was unnecessary.

***

Not really, but maybe A - D is more interesting];B[pr];W[qq]
;B[oq];W[or]C[This also wasn't necessary.];B[os];W[pq];B[og]
;W[li]LB[og:A]C[Black's last move blocked me, so I think this was good (maybe it should be a keima?).

i.) This last move was to small]
(;B[gj]
(;W[mf]LB[rc:B][og:A]C[I think that it was a little bit too slow, but I don't know what would be better.

i.) Black cuting here does not hurt you, attacking A stone or playing B]

Don't ask me :) Strange move hehe.];W[lc];B[mc];W[ld];B[dh]

This is not dangures for white if handled correctly.];W[ch]
