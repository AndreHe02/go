C[Hello!
In this game I play black. There was alot of fighting, and, I'm sure, we both made many mistakes. But, all the same, it was interesting game, so i decided to send it to the GTL. There are some questions during the game, but I will be grateful for any other suggestions!
Thank you in advance for review.
FR

PS: sorry for my poor english.

Hi there, I am Amygdala and I thank you for the honor to review your game. Henceforth, I will mark your comments with FR and mine with A.
Do not worry about English, I am not a native speaker myself and a good deal of the members of GTL are not either...]

[qj:B]C[FR:  
What is the proper local responce to C13?
A (E16) looks slow to me, so in the game I played B. Is it OK?
What do you think about variation, starting from C?

A:
You are right, A looks a little slowish. Most professionals so far preferred D. One possible development is shown in the variation. E is also chosen sometimes.
No professional player ever played B in an official game.
As the variation starting from C is concerned, I inserted my comments in it.]

(;B[qj];W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[ph]LB[rh:B][qm:A]C[FR: 
If I will play B (s12), it looks like begining of a running battle (variation). I wasn't sure about starting it (but now it looks attractive for black), so I played solidly (A).

A:
B is almost inevitable, as it tries to deprive white of a base.]

(;B[qm];W[np];B[jq]LB[cn:B][fq:A]C[FR: 
Again, i dont know, where to play now. Is  approaching  D4 better at A or B better?

A:
I would prefer playing at A, as it puts immediate pressure on white and attacks from the more open side.]
;W[lq];B[fq]C[FR: 
F3 brings first problem of the game. Was solid extension at G3 better?

A:
It is more secure, but less active. I would also have chosen F3.]
;W[hq]LB[fo:A][hp:B][hr:C]C[FR: 
I'm not sure about countering H3. In the game I played A (F5). Is it ok? Whasn't B or C better in this situation?

A:
I think that A is o.k. You are fighting against 2 against five, so it is appropriate to treat one of your stones lightly.]
;B[fo];W[gp];B[fp];W[hn]LB[dn:A][dr:B]C[FR: 
Is A (D6) ok, or better to get base with B (D2)?

A:
A is much better. You did well! Attack is the best means of defense and with your move, you attack the corner and solidify your stones in the process, gaining outside influence.]
;B[dn];W[cq];B[co]C[FR: 
Are there better local moves?

A:
I do not see any. Like that, you minimize your opponents space, which is the proper thing to do.]
;W[ko]
(;B[rh]LB[rc:B][ng:C][ci:E][cj:A][bp:D]C[FR: 
Again, is it proper direction of play? I also considered A-D moves. What can you say about my choice?

A:
I would prefer E, but as white will have to answer your move, it cannot be bad as long as you keep sente.]
;W[rg];B[qh];W[qg];B[pg];W[pf];B[og];W[of];B[ng];W[nf];B[mg]
;W[me];B[md];W[le];B[ld];W[ed]LB[ec:B][de:A]C[FR: 
At this moment i was very happy, having territory in the upper-right and central influence, while white have weak group :)
I wanted to split white into two weak groups (A in the game). Is it ok? What do you think about normal responce at E17 (variations, starting from B)?

A:
You had reason to be happy. So far, you are ahead. The idea to keep the white stones separated is quite correct, especially as you are strong on both sides of them. B ist to passive.]

(;B[de];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[fc]C[FR: is it overplay? What about leaning atack, starting from A (E15)?]
;W[ce]
(;B[be]LB[be:A][cf:B]C[FR: 
Mistake?

A:
I do not think so.];W[cf];B[dd];W[ec];B[fd]C[FR: 
Doubtful. But what is better?

A:
Seems natural, not doubtful.];W[ee];B[df];W[cj];B[ef];W[fe]

(;B[ie]LB[bb:C][hd:D][fg:A][eh:B]C[FR: 
Now I do not know who is attacking. Is running with  A or B, or taking C better?

A:
I like D best, because it makes good shape. It is slow, however, but on the other hand I think you will not be able to capture the white stones immediately. So it is best to strengthen your position first and keep the opponent's stones struggling.]
;W[he];B[hd];W[gg]
(;B[ff]C[A:
A bad move, because it strengthens white and deprives you of an opportunity to cut that might come in handy later. 
Proverb: "Never strike against the knight's move!" (Unless you can cut...).]
;W[gf];B[hf]C[A:
Unelegant for the same reason. Omit moves like the previous two and you will immediately improve by 4 kyus!]
;W[ge];B[cb];W[db];B[bb];W[bf];B[ad]LB[eh:A]C[A:

Alive :)];W[cm]TR[dp][cq]C[FR: 
But now have some problems with other group.
Looks like  black can kill white's corner (variations)?
But in the game i missed the chance.

A:
Right, the white group cannot live, as you proved in the variations.]

Trying to kill...

[jb][fc][ic][jc][fd][hd][id][ie]SQ[qc][kd][ld][md][nd][pd]C[FR: 
A (N17) is doubtful. But in the game I was not able to read variation, starting from B (M18). Is it still possible to kill white without ko?

A:
As shown in the variation, you cannot get a ko...
My idea was: after bringing the triangled stones to life in sente, rescue the squared ones by going for the circled cutting stones!]

[qo][so][qp][rp][sp]C[FR:
Thanks again for the review!
Any general suggestions?

A:
You play quite nice already, and I am sure that you will improve swiftly. Right now I can see three weak points:

1. Nagare
In general, you are still lacking the feeling for the flow of stones (nagare), i.e. you change the place or direction of affairs inappropriately. Examples are moves 13, 15, 27, 71 and 133. The concept of nagare is best to be understood by replaying lots of professional games QUICKLY. I can recommend games by Shusaku, Takagawa or Cho Chikun.

2. Tactics
Do not strenghten your opponent needlessly (moves 63 and 65). In complicated situations, try to simplify (move 95). As in art and science, in Go the most elegant solutions often are the most simple that work.

3. Life and Death
In fights, you obviously lose oversight a little. You can improve that by solving lots of tsume go problens. Go for it!

I hope my commentary will prove useful. Good luck!])
