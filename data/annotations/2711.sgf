C[chipsw [18k\]: hello];B[pd]C[malweth [13k?\]: hi :)

[MJS\]
Greetings. I've been playing for a long time, but have only recently started playing again. My strength tends to be in tesuji and close fighting, rather than in the opening.

Reading books should help a lot; I haven't used Janice Kim's books but I hear they are good. And just keep playing, especially on the internet.]
;W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo];W[nd]C[[M\] Play more defensive? Opening still eludes me.

[MJS\] I think the most conventional way to play would be at L3, but I don't know for sure. There is nothing obviously wrong with your move, and there is a lot about the opening which is still unknown to the best players. Getting a book about the opening would help; I should probably find one myself. Also, observing high level play on the internet or from game records will give you a feel for what patterns are used.

Generally, think of the 4th line as oriented toward influence and the third line as oriented toward territory. Stones with 2 spaces between them each on the 3rd line should be capable of making life unless there are a lot of enemy stones surrounding them. Therefore, playing at L3 allows you to play either at O3 or H3, depending on how black attacks, and either way should leave you enough room to make life.]
;B[jc];W[hc]C[[MJS\] I think this move isn't the best; G17 would be stronger and still place pressure on K17.]
;B[mc];W[nc];B[nb];W[qf];B[qc];W[qi];B[jp];W[dj]C[[M\] At this point I moved to gaining large territory while not attacking black.

[MJS\] This is a good point to take];B[fq];W[dq]C[[M\] block black from crossing under.

[MJS\] this isn't bad, and I often play here when I have black and a handicap. But consider the more aggressive D2 and F4 as well. E3 in this situation is not good, because F4 leaves black with an idea extension from K4.

Another good way to play would be D6.];B[eo];W[dn]C[[M\] Maintain Left Side.

[MJS\] This is fine.];B[ce];W[dg]C[[M\] C13 would have been better?

[MJS\] yes, this leaves you vulnerable to underneath attacks without gaining you very much in the center, I think. This is called leaving an open skirt.]
;B[cc];W[db]C[[M\] Connect to wall with H17?

[MJS\] I would play the more aggressive C18 here, but this move can be argued for. D16 is also worth considering, or the very aggressive C16.]
;B[cb];W[cg]C[[M\] Prevent Cut Under.

[MJS\] your upper stones are too weak for this. D16 would be better.]
;B[dd];W[ec]C[[MJS\] F17 or E16 would be better; you are letting B push you around.]
;B[ef];W[fg]C[[M\] Connect to center, prevent black connection to center? (Later I lose the center, yet still have little influence in the bottom and bottom right).

[MJS\] This is too small; B can still get out. Better points are R8 or L3 or N4 or perhaps H3 or E6 or K16 or O14 or P18. If you must play over here, I think F12 or G12 are better. E16 can also be considered.]
;B[ed];W[fc];B[ge];W[he];B[gf];W[hf];B[bf];W[on]C[[MJS\] this move is going after the hard to take territory in the middle. The moves I mentioned before are still available; R8 is obvious gain.]
;B[ql];W[pk]C[[M\] Should have been Q8?

[MJS\] no. This is not a bad way to try to take center territory. I see people peep at Q2 sometimes in similar situations, going either for the corner or the edge depending on B's response. L3 or some other invasion is also worth considering, as are moves such as N16 or K16 or even P18 to support your weak group at O16. Actually, K16 is probably bad as it attacks toward your weak group.

The big bug still weakly defended B territory in the bottom must be reduced.]
;B[pl];W[pn]C[[MJS\] this doesn't seem to accomplish anything good for you.]
;B[np];W[nk];B[qn];W[no]C[[MJS\] P8 is much bigger, since it saves your two stones from being separated.]
;B[mp];W[fn]C[[M\] Now trying to contain K4, but have little strength to do so.

[MJS\] I think this is too loose a move. You might still be able to live with K3, although J4 would be safer and K5 can also be considered. I would fear P8 as well.]
;B[dl]C[[MJS\] I think this is an overplay on B's part. But think how much better you would be if your previous move was at E6. E6 is still a good move.]
;W[el]C[[MJS\] when trying to kill the enemy, you usually do not want to play a signle stone in contact with them; it gives them a chance to attack you. This move can aim at building a wall toward the center, but it gives up a lot of life along the edge in exchange for it.]
;B[cj];W[bg]C[[M\] Prevent connection];B[eg];W[eh]C[[MJS\] This is not a good move. E11 would be better, since it threatens to either kill C10 or seal off the top center. You don't have enough strength to do both.]
;B[ci];W[dh];B[dm];W[en]C[[MJS\] good];B[cn]
(;W[do]C[[MJS\] no. See the variation; you can safely be more aggressive.]
;B[co];W[cp];B[bm];W[fp]C[[M\] a cut under, but with one less liberty than ideal. Too much work for one stone?
[MJS\] I would have played more aggressively, such as G3 or even H3. You are now very strong in this area, and B has little room to make life. Now is the time to think big. Even J3 or J4 has merit. This was too small. You could also tenuki; A play at G13 would be larger, and O16 still needs help. S16 and P8 are also important. You might also attempt C9, and D9 is sente.]
;B[gp]
(;W[fo];B[gq];W[jn]C[[M\] Containing bottom. My support from the edges is too small after the begin game.
[MJS\] this is a good move but you are now behind.];B[mo];W[mn]
;B[oo];W[po];B[pp];W[op];B[oq]C[[M\] Ko.
[MJS\] only a point or so. You were right to ignore it for a long time.]
;W[ff]LB[gg:A]C[[MJS\] pushing here just makes B stronger. Better to play G13.]
;B[fe];W[df]C[[MJS\] this is sente but small, since B already has room to make life in the corner.]
;B[ee];W[gg]C[[M\] H13 better? Perhaps something different earlier would prevent black's break on move 81.
[MJS\] H13 doesn't really help. not pushing at F14 would have solved this problem.]
;B[hg];W[hh];B[ig];W[je];B[ih]C[[M\] Black's basis for middle play.]
;W[gi]C[[M\] Protect F13 group
[MJS\] I think G12 is better here; or else be aggressive and risky with H11; this is an ugly compromise.]
;B[hd];W[id];B[gd];W[ic]C[[M\] Necessary connection];B[jf];W[kc]
LB[ie:A]C[[MJS\] J15 is the only move.];B[ie]C[[M\] Lost H15 group. Black's middle is strengthened]
;W[jd];B[if];W[of]C[[MJS\] The center is now no ones, and you are way behind.]
;B[hi];W[gh]C[[M\] Necessary];B[hj]LB[ck:A]C[Consider A here]
;W[gj]C[[MJS\] this isn't worth much. I would, in desperation, attempt C9.]
;B[jj];W[ob]C[[M\] seperate black
[MJS\] good];B[pb];W[oa];B[mb];W[oc]C[[M\] Necessary.];B[oe]
;W[ne];B[nf];W[pe]C[[M\] Protect O14, Attack P15, but black is able to expand his middle.]
;B[mf];W[me];B[lg];W[nh]C[[M\] Stronger attack at O13?
[MJS\] this is better. Q17 looks promising, as does S16. You might kill the corner, and be back in the game. Remember the edges and corners are easier places to make territory, so you don't need to worry much about B making territory in the center.]
;B[mh];W[ni];B[lf];W[le];B[ng];W[og];B[qe];W[od];B[qb]
(;W[pc]LB[rd:A]C[[MJS\] Consider A here instead.];B[qd];W[rf]
;B[re];W[mi];B[li]C[[M\] Black's middle is now well defined.
[MJS\] but small; It's easy to take territory away in the middle, hard to keep it.]

;W[mk];B[ln];W[mm];B[kn]C[[M\] Bamboo Joint];W[lm]C[[M\] Weak attack on M5. (Black could not die).]
;B[jo]C[[M\] Fooled black. Connect at L7, Kill L8 Group.];W[km]
;B[ko];W[ho];B[hp];W[io];B[ip];W[oo]C[[M\] Leave Ko, expand Territory at R9!
[MJS\] Yes!];B[rj];W[ri];B[qk];W[pj];B[ol]C[[MJS\] ignore this move, it can't kill you. B5 is significant, and C19 is sente.]
;W[nl];B[bp];W[bq];B[bo];W[eq];B[er];W[dr];B[fr];W[di]C[[M\] D11 does not need protection. Bamboo Joint. - Attack on C9 would be ineffective.
[MJS\] Yes. C19 is better. S15 is significant. I don't think S19 can work, but it can be threatened at least.]
;B[bk];W[bh]C[[MJS\] why not B11?];B[gc];W[gb];B[jb];W[kb];B[da]
;W[ea];B[ca];W[cf];B[cd];W[fb]C[[MJS\] This will be needed, but not until F16 is filled; so go elsewhere first; L14 is a nice way to shore yourself up, or attack with T15 perhaps.]
;B[pa];W[be];B[bd];W[af];B[bi];W[ah]C[[MJS\] Why not A11? C15 is still a nice move, also.]
;B[ai]C[malweth [13k?\]: nice.... deer in the back yard :)]
;W[qj];B[rk]C[[M\] Can't cut black twice ;)];W[om];B[pm];W[ok]
;B[mj];W[nj];B[ke];W[kd];B[kf];W[es];B[fs];W[ds];B[aq];W[br]
C[[M\] A2 was safe.
[MJS\] yes.];B[ar];W[bs];B[go];W[gn];B[ad];W[ae];B[ra]C[[M\] Black doesn't need protection here...?
[MJS\] no; but hard to criticize for a weak player who is winning by 20 or so. Losing here would have lost the game.]
;W[se];B[sd];W[sf];B[si];W[sh];B[sj]
(;W[rh]C[[MJS\] This move is not needed. Remember the formation, it can often save you one point.]
;B[rq]C[[M\] or here.];W[ek];B[em]C[[M\] Neutral point.];W[as]
;B[ap];W[ha]C[[M\] Protection not needed here? G19 or H18 would protect group. K18 group cannot live.

[MJS\] You have a lot of potential to get better, and the Go books should help a lot. I'll leave you with the general advice of, Don't let your opponent push you around; if she/he is pressing you, rather than draw back, there is often a way for you to press him/her. Also, when you are thinking of making an empty triangle, look for a better solution; there often is one.]
