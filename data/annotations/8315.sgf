AB[pd][dp]C[Hello to my reviewer. I am looking mainly for suggestions regarding the eowards the center and reduction of my opponents upper moyo. All other coments and criticisims are welcomed and appreciated, especially regarding urgent points and genral feelings.

dc: Hi I'm dancor on KGS/IGS. I'll mark my comments with dc. You do win this game by 19 points, but you could say that is only because of White getting cut off in the lower right at the end in a huge mistake.  But, I don't think you had problems with controlling in center or of moyos in this game -- you did very well in both of those areas!  (Though move 114 should have been better.)

I think bigger issues were that you never consolidated your advantages in the upper right and White got a large group in the very upper right and also pushed out on the side.  Basically, you need to focus on using sente effectively and choosing important areas to play.  I think you actually overemphasize the center at several points in this game.

Also, it didn't end up hurting you in this game, but I think that you will soon need to start thinking more about weak groups since you have a glaring one here early on.

Also a number of my comments are about good basic shape, which is think is an area to work on as well.]
;W[qp];B[dd];W[jp];B[op]C[dc: This is good!  Corners first in the opening, and the 3-4 opening leaves the corner available.]
;W[pn];B[qq];W[pq];B[pp];W[rq]LB[qr:a]C[KJD shows this at
A for joseki.

dc: In latest KJD ('10 Dec 13) If you look earlier wQ3 was actually a trick move (a suboptimal move intended to create complexity and induce a bigger mistake in response), not a joseki move (an optimal and even local line). When you know your higher-ranked (or desperate-to-catch-up) opponent is rising a local loss to be tricky, it is often good to play simply and safely and watch for tricks.  Black's response here to just extend would be good in response to (a) as well.]
;B[qr];W[rp];B[pj]LB[or:a]C[this is claearly a mistake beter is at a
 as the game shows

dc: Yes, Black misses the trick whereby wQ2 gives White 3 liberties and Black at bR2 will only have 2 liberties.  In general a cutting point bQ3 needs to be addressed, especially when trying to win a handicap game or when otherwise trying to play safe to maintain an advantage.]
;W[pr];B[ps]C[dc: Seeing that you have made a mistake and will lose a local fight is one thing, but playing it all out is much much much worse.  It is much better once you see things aren't going to work out to get something in compensation (like forcing moves to close White in at bP2 and bP3).  And often, it is better to leave the situation alone until later when you might be able to use such forcing moves most effectively.]
;W[os]C[dc: And even now, bP2 would be way better than bR1!  And again playing elsewhere is still probably even better for now.  You should definitely be willing and able to read out the result of the local battle at this point.]
;B[qs];W[rr];B[or];W[rs];B[ns];W[ps];B[nr];W[mq];B[oq]C[dc: bO4 is better than bP3.  bP3 makes an empty triangle which is bad for Black.  bO4 makes a bamboo connection and table shape which is good.  Also wN3 in front of the bamboo connection is inefficient for White.  Always think about good shape and making White's last move look inefficient.

There is another problem here however, and it is the most important concern of all.  These black stones need to escape since they are almost surrounded and have no eyes.  It's amazing that White doesn't play wO5 until much later in the game and then messes up killing these stones.  But these stones are actually killable after this bP3, and even if White can't see that, they should see that they can at least create a strong wall above or left of these weak stones by attacking now or later.  This is why weak groups are bad and have to be dealt with.]
;W[qk]LB[qj:a]C[this came across to me as a srange move hat should be punished. alas I found no refutation save perhaps A, postmortem

dc: You almost always want to respond to a "shoulder hit" like this at bR10 or bR9.  bR10 does have the advantage that the normal answer at wQ9 makes wQ6 one move closer to the pair of stones than best shape. (see variation)]
(;B[pk];W[pl]C[dc: Black has good follow-up moves at bP8 and bR10 which is good.  However, it is definitely more important to think about the endangered black stones in the bottom right first.]
;B[hp]C[dc: The normal reply is for White to strengthen these stones at wK2 or wN5, which weakens the weak Black stones to the right of them (they are more cut off and closed in).]
;W[jd];B[mc];W[fc];B[df];W[dk];B[di];W[cn];B[fq];W[iq];B[ip]
;W[hq];B[gp];W[gr];B[fr];W[cp]C[dc: White is moving around and you are following him.  White is getting the sente moves.  If White makes a move that looks like you have to defend, look around for possible places you could do "mutual damage".  Of course it's tricky and risky to do this.  But always responding and following White around means that you are always having small loses as White gets every border play.]
;B[cq];W[bp];B[bq];W[cj];B[ci];W[bi];B[bh];W[ai];B[ah];W[bk]
;B[en]C[dc: I know you are concerned about central control but it's better to do sente moves on the sides first.  bR10 probably requires a response for example, and then you keep sente.  White won't be able to make anything in the center for a while.  You just have to keep checking to see if something is developing in the center.  There aren't many points there for White currently.  Black has a large number of fourth line stones that help prevent White from easily gaining too much in the center.]
;W[do];B[ep];W[eo];B[fo];W[fk]C[this is what I mean by high play. moving towards the center before everything is setled.

dc: White is pushing out but he's not surrounding any territory.]
;B[fn];W[fe];B[db]LB[fi:a]C[a greedy move that is beter at A, answereing he challenge]
;W[lb];B[lc];W[kc];B[mb];W[la];B[ma];W[jb];B[fi]C[dc: You have secured two huge corners at bD18 and bN18 and gotten to push out before White could make something big in the center out of his side and top groups.  It is true that White has a large area on the top but it's less that 20 points and each of your upper corners is bigger!]
;W[in];B[hm]LB[jo:a]C[to avoid being sealed in and preventing connection
alhtough I considered A.

dc: I think bK5 helps your weak right group more.  Weak groups are important, and will definitely be moreso as you get better and have player that are stronger at killing.]
;W[no]C[dc Yikes!];B[lr];W[mr];B[ms];W[lq];B[kr]C[dc: wK3 will kill the Black stones, and is almost the always correct point for the shape formed by wJ3/wK4/bJ4/bL2.  This move at bL2 in this shape is normally called the eye-stealing tesuji since it is very useful in preventing an eye for White (at K3), but as we can see here it also is often a move that forces White to connect (i.e. it is a peep).]
(;W[jr];B[kq];W[kp];B[jq]C[dc: Now White is split and can only make one eye and your four liberties on the right end up helping a lot.  But if White had respected their weak cutting point at K3 it should have been very bad for Black!]
;W[is];B[ks];W[js];B[ls];W[gs];B[hr];W[np]LB[jf:a][fg:b]C[once again I am confused as to the point of this move. even if he abandons he lower group an expansion up top ie A or B is much better to my  eyes

dc: It's a mistake, because they can't believe they've lost this fight so badly.  Delusion is your enemy in local fights.  In any case, wF13 looks small to me.  Black is the one with a huge moyo, in the upper right.  White's looks small by comparison.  Black just has to develop as fast as White, which should be easy here.]
;B[gq];W[im];B[jo];W[ko];B[io];W[km]LB[hd:a]SQ[mg][pg][mj]C[a looks like a good probe atack now ,but
the marked area was too bitg to loose so I expanded first.

dc: Yes this is a much bigger priority.  And after saving your weak group, you are ahead on territory.  If you are winning, protecting and developing what you have in a safe and simple way is best.  And you should have kept this idea going a bit more with the upper right later on.]
;B[mj];W[lf];B[ne];W[ng];B[mf]LB[pg:a]C[I didn't see till after i was over the sixe of A for white]
;W[mg];B[lg];W[me];B[nf];W[le];B[lh];W[kg];B[og];W[mh];B[mi]
;W[kh];B[li];W[ki];B[kk]C[dc: This doesn't do much.  The White stones above and below are already strong.  Something like bG13 has a much better chance to take away White territory and gain Black territory.]
;W[gg]C[This seems to seal off he upper moyo. I could no atack earlier than 116, but was there a better option earlier?

dc: Last move was perfect (isn't that how it always works out..!)  It is true that White has gotten about 30 points here.  But i favor Black after say bR10 if you can get that in sente and then play bR17.  White has 20 in the lower right and 15 on the left for a total of 65 plus what they get around N6.  Black would have almost 60 just in the upper right!  It's only because White gets both fairly large life in the corner and wR10 later that they have a chance, which they blow by losing the stones around wN3.]
;B[fg];W[hi];B[gh];W[hh];B[hg]LB[hd:a]C[aiming for A

dc: bG14 is way better!  Always look for a sure gain instead of following pipedream attacks.]
;W[gf]C[dc: At this point you need to see that the center is pretty resolved.  The big area is absolutely bR10!  Monkey jumping at bG19 will also be big.]
;B[if];W[ig]C[realized futility of intent here/];B[ik];W[jj]
;B[jk];W[ij];B[hl];W[gj];B[gi];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]C[dc: Attacking at bS17 is also interesting here, but risky unless you can read it out well, so it might be better to only do it if you feel like you need to take a risk to win.]
;B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[sd];B[se];W[rb];B[mm]C[dc: Big mistake here.  Must play bR14.]

(;W[on];B[nn]C[dc: Great job punishing a huge mistake by White!  Connection is very very important, and I think the most important thing to focus on to get good quickly.  The game is effectively over.  This is my last comment.]

(;B[qj];W[pk]C[dc: With no black stones to the sides weakening the connection between a pair of stones and a lone stone, a distance of three spaces is most efficient.  So wQ9 and wQ6 are one space too close here; they are "overconcentrated".]
