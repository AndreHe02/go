C[[NM\] hi, i played black please review,
[NM\] I'm interested in direction of play and making shapes
[NM\] The reading mistakes i will try work on by doing more tsumego :)
[NM\] thanks!

----

JH: Hi! I'll be reviewing your game.  I'll using my initials JH when I comment on the main-line variation.  I'm AGA 2D.]
;B[qe]C[predator [2k\]: gg
binbash [2k\]: hi];W[dp];B[op]C[[NM\] i wanted to try a different opening than i usually play

JH: That's a very good idea and it will make you stronger over time.]
;W[dd];B[fq];W[pp];B[pq];W[qq];B[po]LB[qp:A];W[qp];B[oq];W[oo]
LB[rn:A][fq:B]C[[NM\] this seems like a bad overplay.

JH: Locally, it looks ok. It certainly would be simple for white to play at A.  

However, given that black already has a stone at B, it's probably not good to cut since Black can probably create territory on the bottom in a fight.]

(;B[qo];W[ro];B[rn]
(;W[sp]
(;B[rq]LB[qm:A]C[[NM\] mybe not good to throw in?

JH: Right. It doesn't help you. Better to protect at A first.]
;W[rr];B[qr]C[[NM\] keep this till after b r7 instead?];W[rp]
;B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[qs]
(;B[lq]LB[oo:A]C[[NM\] i was wary of white extension at o5 causing problems?

JH: I think it would to play higher.  The fourth line is for attacking influence.  It was never really brought into play in the game, but the stone at A could have been quite annoying.]
;W[fp]LB[pm:A]C[[NM\] this helps black?

JH: Right.  Not a good idea for White to make B stronger in this direction.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[go]TR[oo]C[[NM\] right to push up here?
[NM\] it seems to work well with m3 stone

JH: Might be ok.  It's going to be hard to make a big moyo because of the marked stone]

(;W[pj]
(;B[gn]LB[fn:A][oo:B][gq:C]C[[NM\] a bit slow but powerfull?

JH: I think it's a little slack.  It doesn't put very much pressure on white, in the same way that playing at A would.

There's several weaknesses in your shape (B and C), so white will have a relatively easy time reducing.]

(;W[od];B[om]C[[NM\] slow again mybe
[NM\] b q14 instead?

JH: This is fine. it helps make the O5 stone less annoying, while also helping you to build your moyo.]
;W[pf];B[qf]C[[NM\] i feel that black cant allow white to get r14

JH: Right.];W[pg];B[pc];W[oc];B[pb];W[dn];B[ic]LB[pb:B][fc:A]
C[[NM\] ok, so split the top side?

JH: Seems like a good time. W should play at A next.]
(;W[gd];B[lc];W[jc]C[JH: Not a good idea for W.];B[jd]C[[NM\] i couldn't decide between k18 or k16]
;W[id]
(;B[hc]LB[jb:A]C[[NM\] mybe k18 is safe here but it gives white a good result
[NM\] mybe better to play k18 since black seems like having a good fuseki

JH: A is better. W's corner is still open, which gives B an opportunity to invade.  There are better options for you.]
;W[kd];B[je];W[kc]TR[hc][ic][lc][oc][jd][od][je][pf][pg]C[JH: White is very happy about this result, since it makes these stones much more secure.  Moreover, Black has three groups to deal with.]
;B[hd];W[ie];B[ke];W[ld];B[ge];W[if]
(;B[ec]LB[fd:A]C[[NM\] i thought mybe f16 and keep it simple
[NM\] but i thought e17 is a good point to get

JH: Better to play at A and strengthen your position.  This leaves a weakness behind at A.]
;W[fd];B[ed];W[fe];B[he]
(;W[gc];B[ig]LB[jf:A]C[JH: This is an odd move, but it's hard for me to evaluate if it's a good idea or not.  It really depends on what your intention of this was.  In the game, it just seemed to give White a free move at A.]

(;W[jf]
(;B[de];W[ee];B[cd];W[df]
(;B[dc]C[[NM\] better to take or play c15 instead?

JH: In this case, you're right, C15 is a bit better.];W[ce]
;B[be]
(;W[dd];B[cf];W[de];B[bc];W[gg]C[JH: Black has lost a lot of points. W looks ahead to me]
;B[le]C[[NM\] i lost h15 stones
[NM\] but this threatens, b b13, w h14, b g14 etc];W[hf];B[md]
;W[mc];B[me];W[lb];B[fb];W[gb]
(;B[cg]C[[NM\] mybe not a good idea but seems big
[NM\] mybe play n12 instead?

JH: It's very big. Your stones at top are very heavy, so this is ok if you want to give them up.  You are behind though, so stiring up trouble in the upper right might be a good idea.]

(;W[lh];B[kg];W[kf];B[lg];W[lf];B[mg];W[mf]
(;B[ng]TR[pg][lh][pj]C[[NM\] ok, so sacrifice the stones seems like a good idea?

JH: Right now, it looks hard to separate the mark white stones, so I would say that it's not a good idea.]

(;W[jg]C[JH: W's mistake.];B[nf]C[JH: Good];W[ne];B[oe]
(;W[pd]C[JH: A mistake for White. Now Black has a chance to attack White on the right.]

(;B[pe]C[JH: Very nice.];W[qd];B[nd]LB[lj:B][nj:A]TR[jd][md]
[je][ke][le][me]C[JH: It's much too slow to save these stones.  It's ~15 points, yes, but 15 points in gote.

You need to get compensation for losing the corner, which was more like 20 pts. Playing at A or B would be good ways to go, now.]
;W[nc];B[ne]C[[NM\] mybe o15 is actually small, and i should play r11 or o10 looks good instead
[NM\]it is only 14 points so i think it was too small :(

JH: Yes, saving your stones was too small.  Losing the corner was around 20 points.]

(;W[qg]
(;B[rd];W[rc];B[rf];W[sd]LB[nj:A]C[[NM\] mybe it is better to play o10 instead?
[NM\] not sure how to attack the white stones, help?
 i played r11 next and did not get a good result, actually black almost died, so o10 i think, which also enlarges moyo if white manages to live?

JH: Yes, You must first prevent them from running. I.e. by playing at A]

(;B[qi]TR[rf][qm]C[JH: White already doesn't have a base because of the marked stones]
;W[pi];B[rh];W[pl];B[pm];W[rg];B[sg];W[re];B[nk];W[sf];B[se]
;W[nj]LB[qi:A]C[[NM\] not it seems bad for black, so something went wrong

JH: Playing at A was the mistake];B[rd];W[hq];B[gq];W[re];B[sf]
;W[mk];B[nl];W[qj];B[rj];W[ji]
(;B[mj]C[[NM\] this cut was not good but i couldnt see a good continuation for black, mybe m10 instead?

JH: I think m10 looks better also.];W[lj];B[mi];W[mh];B[ni]
;W[nh];B[li];W[kh];B[oh];W[oi];B[oj];W[ki];B[nj];W[rk]C[[NM\] i expected white to connect p13 :)

JH: This was a mistake for White, but it's still pretty hard to kill white since you have so few liberties.]

(;W[qh];B[sc];W[rb]
(;B[sb]LB[sh:A]C[JH: You have enough liberties now that you can play at A.]
;W[sh];B[qc];W[ob];B[ra];W[ri]
(;B[cj]LB[ck:B][im:C][km:A]C[[NM\] now to decide between a move at l7? or c10
[NM\] i think l7 would have easily won the game, now that i review afterwards

JH: It looks very pretty close to me.  Even with playing at A, White will get B.  I think White is still up by maybe a couple of points.]
;W[lp]
(;B[mp]LB[kp:A]C[[NM\] i thought play m6 and cap but i was a little worried by p5 stone

JH: Should be at A or B.  This looks cramped.];W[kq];B[lo]C[JH: This move makes white stronger.]

;B[mm];W[km];B[jp];W[ip];B[mn];W[jq];B[gj]C[[NM\] ok so now the moyo is gone and black has a difficult game, mybe a little behind now
[NM\] not sure what to play here
[NM\] c8 or e7 instead?

JH: Black is quite behind now. I count White at about 70 pts and Black at ~45 points.  So Black is about 25 points. behind.]

(;W[dk];B[ck]C[[NM\] i couldnt let white get c9, the game would be over, too much for white?]
;W[gk];B[hk]C[[NM\] f9 mybe would have been better to make a connection
[NM\] i wanted to keep white from getting territory in the centre

[NM\] i will stop comments now,
[NM\] the black group lives but the game is over

[NM\]please help to understand how i lost
[NM\] was it because i played c10 and not l7?
[NM\]was there other big mistakes i made?
