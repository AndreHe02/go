C[Hi, thank you for reviewing my game.
I felt that at the opening I am able to control white to a certain extent, making him play where I expect him to play.
However, in the mid-game I realize I am not that good at counting and lose to him in many battles.
How could I have improve my game here? Thanks

(;B[mp]C[Very loose move. White just got into your sphere of influence - don't be so kind and push him around.]
;W[pm];B[rk];W[rq];B[qr];W[ql];B[qk];W[nm]LB[qi:A]C[I thought I came out better in this exchange as I am about to lock in white area and have influence in the top right. Am I right to think so? Or I should have played a few more moves?

White is quite happy here. He got almost alive shape and black three stones can be easily harassed by playing around A]

(;B[fq]C[Not bad, but three black stones on the right seems to need some support.]

(;W[dn];B[cm]C[I was thinking that I can get the corner off him since I have a seed on K3 that block his influence toward the right, but on hindsight, should i have make a jump to E7 to cut off his influence in the center?

You can't have everything :) It was whites corner, so he has got to get something from here. Bottom side looks good for black. Pretty nice corner and some territory on lower right. Right now white got only two living groups and unfinished corner.]

(;W[el]C[Very slow for white. There are no points in the center, as both players got influence there.]

(;W[dl];B[bj];W[cn];B[bn];W[ej];B[di]C[Am I right to try to link by the two portion of black here? or I should concentrate more on the center?

Center is not worth too much in this game. It is to hard for both players to create points there, as with few moves it can be destroyed. Black can play K6 to destroy whole center for white. And black doesnt have any support to fight for center. Moste importants are corners and side territory here.]

[bl:F][dn:I][hn:D][pq:C]C[Black got sente. It is good time to count some points. You should try to assess the situation on the board at least three times during the game. After opening, after first large battle settles and right before end game. Here we are almost at the endgame. Lets see whats on board. 
A group is weird. Very weak points at C17.
B group is not alive yet.
C group is alive but very small
D group dead
E group strong and alive making (around 25)
F alive making points (around 25)
G can bea easily cut off from black living group.
H looks weak, should be alive, but not many points - G is the target
I big white group - over 55 points with black dead stones]

With good endgame it was very playable for black. 
I think biggest are for improvement for you is to consider group status on the board. Each time you got sente, ask yourself - which groups are weak? Where are biggest areas on the board? Can I easily fix my weak group? Can I fix my group while doing something else like attacking aor getting points? Can I attack this opponents weak group with one move?

Even mediocre move in right direction can be better than best move in wrong direction :)]
