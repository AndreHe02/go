 Hello

I'm wysi (real name joe, 30k on igs), playing black.  I lost this game fairly badly (and I have a pretty good idea why), but I would like to get some ideas on how to improve my game.  I've mentioned below some of the issues that I would like to have reviewed.  To begin with, I should mention that I am weak at fighting, so please forgive some of my more obvious lapses!

Thanks in advance for you help.];B[pd]C[Hi Joe, i'm dede, 9k* on igs.   Your main mistakes were made in the opening. Generally, try to use opening moves to create safe shapes. That gives stability and a base for your groups. Than, you can use them to create territory or attack. Learn from observing stronger players and from commented games. Fighting skills need time and experience, so play, play, play :) Your opponent is your teacher - he shows you your mistakes.]

(;B[qh]LB[md:a][fc:b][fq:c]C[Joe:  best to pincer here, or extend to a?  Or perhaps even approach at b or c?

dede: This pincer is bad, as it is too far from your corner enclosure below. If you want to pincer in this position, try variations. O16, O17, N17 are standard responses in this corner.]
;W[of];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[jc]C[Joe:  I don't actually know any joseki, but this sort of looks like one...
dede: joseki ends after R17
K17 is too far away, W can invade at M17, so you'll need to add a stone at K15. This is too slow at this stage of the game. L17 is better, but there are many bigger moves, like C6, C10, K4. R12 stone looks now weak, so playing P12 wouldn't be bad too.]
;W[hc]C[dede: W's pressure is premature, it just helps B to solidify his stones]
;B[je];W[he];B[cf]C[dede: With this move B closes himself any possibilities to make something in this corner.
Invading at C17 would make W overconcentrated, but is premature. C6, K4, P12...]
;W[ce];B[ci]LB[cj:a][df:b]C[Joe:  I think this move was a big mistake.  First it was too close (perhaps needed to be at a).  Would b have been better?  Or perhaps some other response?

dede: After b W would play C11 or C12, but it is much better than a. I don't think that C11 move is a big mistake in this situation. C12, and than F13 would create a safe base.]
;W[cg]C[dede: W makes a mistake starting fight so fast. B group is already weak, and B has R12 stone to take care about. W should play K3, C6 or may be R10. Stronger opponent could use this immediate attack  to strenghten his stones or even invade the top left corner.]
;B[ch]MA[cf]C[Joe:  here I merely wished w to atari the marked stone]
;W[bf];B[cm]C[Joe:  Attempting to make a base

dede: C7 was too optymistic. As you see from W's response, C8 was better.]
;W[ck]C[Joe:  these moves often leave me puzzled about the proper response.  As you can see from the continuation I chose to pincer.  Is that the best idea, or is there another?  Is the stone at c9 an overplay, and how best can it be punished?

dede: W attempts to destroy any shape you try to build, to create complications. See vars for standard responses]

(;B[gq]C[dede: Left side. You can not leave the left side like this. G3 is too far from shimari (right down corner enclosure) and makes only little pressure on W's stone. Now W can easily divide your stones to weak, isotated groups.]
;W[cn];B[dm];W[ek]C[dede: You can still connect your stones. See var]

(;B[ei];W[eg]C[Joe:  the result of my decisions so far is that w has a rather large chunk of the top left

dede: Much more, you have 2 weak groups on the left side and 2 lonely looking stones on the right and down. W is leading and have easy game, just attacking you.]
;B[gi];W[hg]C[Joe:  I deliberated quite a while over this move, wishing that I could find a tesuji in the top left.  I couldn't see one   dede: it's too late.Connecting your stones on the right side is the only direction now.]
;B[jg]C[dede: K13 and next 2 or 3 moves work against your stones on the right]
;W[ih];B[jh];W[ii];B[ji];W[qj]C[Now this stone looks really lonely...]
;B[oh];W[lh]
(;B[ql]LB[oj:a][qn:b][le:c][om:d]C[Joe:  In retrospect this move was the turning point of the game - the point at which I was guaranteed to lose (looking at the final position you will see a lot of dying stones in the middle of the board).  Perhaps a would have been a better choice?  Then white b, black c (or d)?

dede: Wrong side. Play from weak stones, push your opponent against your strong stones. See var]
;W[oj];B[ng];W[nf];B[mg];W[le];B[lg];W[lc]C[dede: see var]
(;B[kd]C[Joe:  surely there must have been a better response?  Not sure what it might have been though...]

;W[mb];B[nb];W[nc];B[oa];W[ne];B[od];W[kf];B[kg]C[dede: K14...]
;W[jf];B[lj];W[mi];B[mj]C[Joe:  My thoughts at this point were to squeeze the white group and make w work for life.  In retrospect it would have been far better to ensure life for my stones (or perhaps ideally do both at the same time) but I am not sure about the best way to do this.

dede: Don't touch what you want to attack.
Your opponent needs 2 eyes to live. Just try to surround him and take away space for making eyes.
W can connect his stones the same way you can on the right side (one of the previous vars).]

C[dede: Very big mistake. P7 was better, closing W];W[om];B[pn]
;W[nm];B[ll];W[mn];B[kq]C[dede: Bad, you just ask for trouble in the center. Anyway, the shape on the bottom is weak. Better is L4, but this kind of move can be played only in opening.]

;W[ls];B[kr];W[kp];B[jp];W[ko];B[jo];W[jn];B[no];W[mo];B[np]
;W[mp];B[nn]C[dede: this kind of forcing makes your center group weaker]
;W[mm];B[ks];W[ms];B[go];W[in]C[Joe:  I can see the wisdom in white's attack, cutting off the stones in the middle from the ones below and in the lower right.

dede: You have 2 groups in real troubles. One of them will propably have hard time making life. W have a very big territory in top left and leads a lot.   No comments from this point.]
