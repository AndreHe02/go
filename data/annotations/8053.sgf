*dtslife: all my questions/comments are marked with an asterisk
*Dear reviewer, I would like both sides reviewed with slightly more focus on white's play.
*General comments about both styles of play and strategy are much appreciated.

*Also, do you recommend any books for shodan or higher level dan players that will be conducive to my style of play?


*Thank you for review my game.];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[ed]LB[ed:B]

;B[cd]LB[cc:C][ce:A][df:B]C[*What is the best joseki to choose for white? A, B, or C? IMHO, i think A is best and seem like it will obtain influnce for the d4 stone?

klin: Again, it has to do with your game strategy.];W[cc]C[*I chose d17 because I thought I was lagging behind in territory and I am not the best at moyo strategy.
 Can you explain a bit on how I could have used moyo strategy in this situation?

It ids too early to say "lagging in territory".  However, you chose E16, which emphasizes influence.  Now you try to take territory.  You may not have a consistent startegy.]

(;W[dl];B[cj]TR[cl][dl][cm]C[*I did not like the position of the empty triangle? I felt like I played an inferior move somewhere.

klin: This is not an "empty triangle".  When you played C7 earlier, it is expected.]
