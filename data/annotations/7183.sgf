C[J: Hi. My name is Joe and I'm roughly 1d. 
I've marked all my comments with a "J:".];B[qd];W[dd];B[cp]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[hc]C[usually i play R14, but I didn't like a white extension + D16 stone...

J: This stone is a bit too far to put any pressure on the right. White has room to play K17, and you don't seem to have any great continuations.]

C[J: At this point, you are leading. Your positions are solid and white will have a hard time making territory with his 7 stone group.]
;W[qn]C[J: This is the wrong direction for White to approach this corner. 
White's underbelly is exposed in the upper corner, so it will be very difficult for anyone to get territory here.

Understanding this is important for knowing how to play next.]
;B[ql]C[J: For the same reason mentioned on the last move, this is not the area you want to play.
You can invade any territory white tries to take here from your S14 stone.
It would be much better to play around O3 since this area has much more potential for you and White can not easily make territory here.]
;W[nq];B[pn]C[I try to defend Q4 (if w. live in the corner i have a wall to attack O3)]
;W[qq];B[qo];W[pq]C[J: The joseki sequence ends here, but this result it horrible for you with the upper corner and the aji left with R6.]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[be];B[cj];W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[id];W[lc]
;B[lb];W[mc];B[gb]C[too small?
(I think my group isn't safe...)

J: Your group didn't a set 2 eyes, but you are not in any immediate danger. The bottom is the biggest place to play at this point.]
;W[ep]
(;B[dn]C[with E3 I take the corner but white takes the lower side and can still invade the left side....

J: It is very difficult for black to surround territory above with the underbelly exposed.
B15 is ready to reduce any territory surrounded.
It is better to take the corner with E3 and expect a white invasion. You can also invade the bottom that white gets.]
;W[cq];B[dp];W[dq];B[bp];W[fq];B[jq]C[J: I prefer one line higher here at K4. It reduces white and white has no easy way to attack your stone.]
;W[hq];B[jo]C[J: You spend another move here to pull your stone out to safety.]

(;B[jl];W[ml];B[ll]C[J: Better to leave this stone unplayed. You only help white here.]

(;B[fh]C[white has a monkey jump to play from B15, so i decided to defend the center

J: You're right about the monkey jump eating into your territory, but allowing white to cut through your position leads to your difficulties here.]

You did well in the mid-game and end-game for the most part. Paying more attention to the surrounding areas when choosing the direction to play will help your game out tremendously.]
