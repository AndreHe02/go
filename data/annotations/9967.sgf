AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, I played a two stone handicap game against my friend. I'm about 7k and he's around 5k, but I usually win the handicap games quite comfortably, but ended up losing narrowly here. I ended up misreading and white captured over ten stones in the early midgame. After that I mishandle a white group on the right side by stubbornly playing ko. I had a chance to kill it or at least not lose all my territory there, but  I managed to even up the game quite a bit and I'm mostly interested in if I could've played the endgame part better to have a chance in winning. Another point would be the situation on the lower left area where I had white groups to attack, I wasn't happy with how I played there during the game.

J: Hi, my name is Jay, and I will be reviewing your game. My comments begin with "J:".]
PL[W];W[pp];B[cd];W[ic]C[My friend really likes to split the side instead of approaching. I'm starting to get used to this.]

(;B[fc];W[mc]C[J: Approaching to O17 has more of an effect on the corner.]

(;B[qf]C[I wasn't sure if I approached from the right side, maybe the other way around would be better, but I felt like the large keima from the 3-4 point give me more secure territory.

J: Both approaches are ok. See variation.

J: Black can also choose to play P17 to look at the L17 weakness. Here, white's Q18 move looks very nice. See variation.]

(;W[cj]C[Another split by white and as I said, he really likes these.

J: The split is still ok here. C11 is another option that restricts white's extension on the top left corner. See variations.]
;B[ch]C[J: When black's extension is this far, white has aji around C17.]
;W[fp]C[This was a really weird tenuki in my opinion. I probably could've gotten a much better result than I got in the game.

J: Strange approach, but on the other hand, this is a handicap game. C6 is more usual.]
;B[cn]C[I didn't want to weaken my corner too much by going further. I've been having some problems with the corner aji later against him.]
;W[cl]C[I'm really happy at this point. I felt I could get a good attack going on at this point since white's top group is a three space extension as well.]
;B[fq]C[This was greedy of me. I should've just jumped out and started attacking immediately I think. I though I could play this in sente.

J: Black should split white at E6 immediately. Trading F3 first only strengthens white's bottom group.]
;W[gq];B[eq];W[gp];B[en]C[This felt slow to me and allowed white to build a good formation on the bottom side. I'll still have my attack that I didn't handle correctly.

J: E6 is necessary here. Letting white loosely connect and surround with E7 is too nice.]
;W[dg]TR[cj][cl]SQ[ch]C[This felt a weird direction for this shoulder hit, strengthening my square stone against his triangled ones.

J: Yes.];B[dh]C[J: Good fighting spirit.];W[fk]C[J: White has a weakness at D9.]
;B[gn]C[This is a move that I'm not really happy with. My plan was to use this to split him up and then play E13 and start fighting. He gets a really good formation on the bottom side and I get sidetracked during the attack.

J: G6 is an important move to keep white separated. Letting white play G7 seals black in and lets white make a moyo of the bottom side.]
;W[kp];B[qn]C[This should probably be at E13.

J: R6 is large, but E13 is urgent to reduce aji.];W[pn];B[pm]
;W[on];B[qo];W[qp]
(;B[pl]C[This was a mistake. I should've either pushed up or extended I think. I feel like the L4 stone is a bit too far and I can invade somewhere around O3, which I do in the game.

J: Q6 is slow. Extending to Q10 is better than pushing at P7 in this case. See variations.]
;W[pj];B[nq]C[In hind sight I should've probably secured a base for my group, but I felt like there's something here. If the L4 stone is one further away at L5 I would play here immediately, but I'm unsure if it limits my options now.

J: O3 is weirdly timed. Black should jump to O8 first, because Q10 is weak. This will lead to a running battle that favors black.]

(;W[np]C[J: White should restrict black's access to the corner with P3 first. See variation.]

(;B[oq]LB[qn:B][nq:A]C[Is this better than the hane at N4 variation? I wanted to secure somekind of base since if I just come out white can split me and attack both of my groups A and B at once.

J: I prefer N4 here because a running battle is still possible. This variation, black must live small. See variation.]
;W[op]
(;B[mq]C[J: L2 is a faster way to live. See variation.];W[qk]
C[J: R9 is painful for black.];B[qr]C[J: Black should jump to L2 first. Diving into the corner means that white's move around S3 attacks both of black groups' bases.]
;W[kr]C[I'm not happy with my play for a good amount of moves starting from this. I felt like my stones were quite heavy at this point and I couldn't recover if I lost them. There's also still the E13 move which I felt like was probably the biggest move in the game for quite a long time, but neither one of us played it for a while.

J: Correct.];B[lp];W[lo];B[ko]C[J: This cut is difficult.];W[mp]
;B[lq];W[kq];B[jo]C[I try to do something here. I feel like my corner group is on pretty good shape, not 100% alive if I read it correctly, but I can do some more attacking still.]
;W[hn];B[iq]C[I thought this would work, but later I felt like I was a bit too greedy again.

J: Even if this doesn't work, it's not bad to get aji here.]
;W[ip];B[jp];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[hp];W[go];B[ho]
(;W[fn]TR[lo][on][pn][mp][np][op][pp][qp]C[I'm not too happy with this result. White gets to connect his groups, but maybe the position isn't that bad since I can still attack his marked stones a bit? I probably should've played more calmly, but I tend to do quite well against him in chaotic games.

J: This position looks better for black now. Yes, white is out, but white's groups is in trouble.

J: White should play K3 first, because it makes F2 not sente for black. See Variations.]
;B[gm];W[fm];B[gl];W[fl]C[I'm not sure these pushes were needed. I probably should've just fixed my middle group instead.]
;B[eo]C[I thought these peeps were maybe unnecessary and I strengthened white while not getting much out of it myself.]
;W[fo];B[jq]C[This is sente.];W[jr];B[fr]C[This gets me a couple of points more, but I lose some in the endgame since I still have to fix the cutpoint at D3 later...]
;W[gr];B[ln]TR[gl][gm][gn]C[So now I feel like my group is doing okay and I start the attack. I'm not sure if losing the triangled stones in the middle is an acceptable result for me? Also there's still the E13 to play...]
;W[mo];B[qq]C[This was probably a mistake. I wanted to solidify my group, but this just weakened both of them after white responded.

J: S2 is a simpler way to solidify. It makes eyespace in the corner and also takes away white's potential eye while threatening to connect to S4.]
;W[rp];B[nl];W[mm]C[I have to be careful here. I think I have way too many weakish groups and if I juggle them incorrectly some of them might get hurt a lot.]

(;B[lm]C[J: No need to push from behind here, instead black should solidify the center group from a distance. See variation.]
;W[ll];B[oj]C[I was worried about his group and I felt like I could make the center group live easily. I end up misreading and losing all of the stones instead.

J: You must make sure your leaning move is really sente.];W[jm]
C[I read that this would be okay for me and I could live. It's really close with the shortage of liberties though...

J: K7 is a good move on a key point.];B[im];W[kn]
(;B[jn]C[J: K6 must be at J6 to make life in local sente. See variation.]
;W[km]
(;B[pi]C[And yeah, here's my misread, such an easy one as well :(]
;W[in]C[So now I realize my stones are dead and white is pretty strong all around. I counted quickly and felt like I should really get a lot of profit from the triangled stones. Another point of this game was that I'm not really happy with how I handled that area now. Since the game got quite close I felt like I could've gotten an easy win if I just killed them. I wonder if that's possible? Also at this point E13 is starting to look REALLY huge so I want to play it as fast as possible.

J: This is a huge loss for black. It's difficult to find compensation for this, as this is solid cash.]
;B[eg]C[J: Maybe R11 is bigger now.];W[ef];B[ff];W[fe];B[fg]
;W[ge];B[ed]C[Maybe one of the atari's instead? I was worried about the amount of forcing moves white gets then though. Center is looking problematic, but I'm hopeful that my stones have enough aji to reduce it easily.

J: E16 is fine.];W[ee];B[df]C[J: No need to trade D14, C15 alone is good enough.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[bf]TR[hd]C[Now I'm connected and there's still a possible weak point in white's shape around the marked area. I thought that maybe I could utilize that to link up to my stones in the center later.]
;W[qi]C[And here we go. Ko extravaganza. I'm really unhappy now that I didn't play here. White also gets way too good result in this since my bottom right corner is a bit weakish still.

J: Black need s to mind the weakness at E12.];B[qh]
(;W[rj]C[J: S10 can be at Q12 to make easier life. See variation.]
;B[ri]C[Ko time.];W[rh];B[qj];W[pb]C[Maybe just taking the Ko is bigger, I wasn't sure in the game and also felt like I could get more ko threats from my middle stones (that's a mistake though). After the game I feel like white has way more ko threats than me since my corner is pretty weak. That's why after the game I thought taking would be better here.

J: Yes, white has more ko threats right now.]
(;B[qb]C[This should be R17 since Q18 is too far from the N17 stone and I can cut it off with O18 after.
I thought about playing Q17 but didn't like the clamp that white gets in that variation. I can't lose very much territory since white got such a large capture earlier.

J: Locally R17 is correct. Globally, R17 is stronger because a ko fight is happening and black doesn't not want to give white ko threats.]
;W[qi];B[jl]C[Yeah and now I realize I don't have that many ko threats...]
;W[io];B[qj];W[sr];B[rr]C[I'm really not sure how to fix the black shape here. The problem is no matter what I do white gets tons of ko threats.

J: S2 works.];W[qi];B[pk];W[si];B[qj]C[I wanted to continue fighting since I could get some threats from the top white group. After the game I wondered if just connecting is good enough?

J: White doesn't need to fight the ko to win. R17 is good enough.]

(;B[rs]C[J: S1 is a mistake, white can start a ko for the life of the bottom side. M2 is correct. See variations.]

(;W[qi];B[ph];W[pj];B[ps];W[rf]TR[qb]C[And now white is starting to look alive and I lost a lot of points. I feel like I'm behind at this point and have to start getting territory somewhere. Very unhappy with my triangled stone since one of the other options would be so much better here...]
;B[pg];W[rg];B[if]C[I have to cut now think to have a chance.

J: It's not a bad idea.];W[gh];B[fi];W[hi];B[gj];W[gk];B[hj]
;W[fh];B[eh]C[J: There is still a weakness at E11.];W[ii];B[hk]
;W[hl]C[J: White can just play K14 to seal the victory.];B[jj]

(;W[ig]C[J: Wrong direction for white, see variation.];B[ji]
C[J: Black should save the cutting stone at K14.];W[kk]C[J: L9 is dame. Still better to capture K14.]
;B[jh]C[Maybe this is better as an extension from K14 stone? I was more worried about getting some kind of profit from this attack than actually killing. I felt like if I could erase the center potential and play a good endgame I would still have a chance.

J: Fighting is better.];W[jf];B[mh]C[J: Too small, only worth about 4 points.]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[pf];B[of];W[jk]C[J: R17 is last big point.];B[lg]
MA[ib][ob][qd][bi][bm]C[J: Small again. The marked points are bigger.]
;W[ij];B[ik];W[kl];B[gi]C[I should just fix and not take this immediately since I end up fixing any ways.]
;W[ih];B[ei]C[J: E10 is better. Maybe white will answer.];W[bm]
;B[le]C[I felt like reducing this was bigger than responding to white's move.

J: Only if it kills white.];W[kd];B[ld];W[lc];B[pc]C[J: Q17 is definately not larger than B6.]
;W[ob];B[bn];W[an];B[ao];W[am];B[bo];W[il];B[qj]C[I counted briefly and knew the game was pretty close. I wasn't sure that I had enough good endgame moves to gain enough points at this point. I'm interested to know if I could've played differently.]
;W[oe];B[nd];W[pj];B[oi]C[I felt like my shape was a bit weak, but fixing here felt slack. I should've just played the ko I think.

J: There are more efficient ways to fix.];W[qj];B[ib];W[jb]
;B[ha];W[bi];B[bh];W[li];B[ja];W[kb];B[ke];W[je]C[J: White should simply take L12 now.]
;B[kh]
(;W[rc]C[Losing all of this corner is really big. When I look that white lived in my territory and got quite a few points on the right side, I thought my handling of that was the losing part of the game and not the misread earlier.

J: White missed the opportunity to cut here. See variations.

J: The rest looks to be small endgame. I think the take away from this game is that both sides missed a lot of opportunitieswhile fighting. The loss of the center group was very painful for black. And then, in the endgame, both sides actually still had the chance to win, swings of 10-15 points occured.
