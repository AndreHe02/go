RE[B+60.50]

AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[[We discussed moves some during the game, and I've left those comments in.  My thoughts after the game are in brackets, like this.  If you have time, green42 would like moves reviewed as well.  Thanks, Kas.\]

dede: Hi, I'm 5k in my national ranking list. I hope this comment will be useful]
;W[jj]C[[I'm planning to have several small groups scattered around the board, with the option to run to the center if needed.  I also hope to have some territory in the center.\]

dede: If you want territory in the center, why do you put a stone inside it? I think it is better to build walls on 4th and 5th line. Playing against so many handicap stones, you must be flexible and your moves must surprise and affect opponent.]
;B[cc]C[[I thought this move was a bit slow at the time, but Black gained a huge territory in this corner, so maybe not bad at all.\]

dede: This is why k10 was bad. Black can  build unharmed.];W[fq]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[en]C[dede: this move is bad. E6 stone can be cut from d4 and should be played at d6 or c6. White can play c6 now and start to complicate the game. 
Playing against so many handicap stones, you must take risk.]
;W[iq]C[[I wonder if J4 would've been better for me.\]

dede: this move is ok.];B[jq];W[ip]C[[This feels too heavy.  Maybe I should've played out into the center instead?  I feel like I have very powerful stones, but they don't face anything useful.\]

dede: There is no safety against 8 handicaps, especially in the beginning. Locally, g6 is much better, then o3 to split k3 and q4 stones. C6 is still promising.]
;B[mq];W[nc];B[nd];W[pc];B[od];W[oc];B[mc];W[rc]C[dede: White plays to easy. This helpes Black to build shapes and keeps game simple.]
;B[re];W[qm];B[ro];W[qj];B[qi];W[qk];B[pk];W[qo]C[dede: q8 is better. There is still corner aji.]
;B[rp];W[qp];B[qq];W[pn]C[[Here I was willing to give up some second-line territory for influence towards the center.\]

dede: Very bad result for White.];B[rn];W[qn]C[[I don't really like this move.  Maybe S7 instead, or something around O5?\]

dede: 2 empty triangles - terrible shape. If you want influence - don't care about every stone.  I like o5 move here.]
;B[rm];W[pl];B[pi];W[el]C[dede: White q6 group is heavy. Still, o5 is important.
E8 move pushes Black against your weak group. Locally g6 and then c6.]
;B[gn];W[in]C[[I think I should've played G8 instead, to support the E8 stone.  It will die.\]]
;B[gl];W[ck];B[cj];W[cn];B[dm]C[dede: b4, and then c7, gives White local life. Look at variants.
With e8 stone, Black's d7 is bad.]
(;W[dn]C[[What am I doing here?  Attempting to cut a diagonal connection??  I like C7 or C4 better.\]

dede This move is ok - creates complications. White can cut at e7 or e5. Thats the way to win handicap game.]
;B[em];W[cp];B[cq];W[do]C[[Here I'm planning to connect with F4 or at least isolate the corner.  I expected to keep sente and then follow up with C7.  I maybe should've played C7 first.\]]
;B[cm]C[dede: this move is bad. Black should split opponent's groups with e5 and try to live in corner.]
;W[eo]C[[I decided to abandon E8 and take the corner instead.\]

dede: First complication and White has profit. E8 and c9 stones made their task and still have some aji.]
;B[fo];W[go];B[fn];W[dr];B[fj];W[dq]C[[I don't think this move was worth losing sente.\]

dede: Yes.];B[mj];W[ml]C[dede: o5.];B[mo];W[mn]C[[I had hoped to make better use of my group on the right.  I gave up the second line expecting to do great things with the center influence.\]

dede: White has no influence here. Only a  weak group.];B[lo]
;W[kn];B[ko];W[qe];B[qd];W[qf];B[og]C[dede: s16];W[rd]C[[So I've cut off S15 as planned, but my two stones on the third line are looking small now.\]]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[nb];W[ob];B[oa];W[pb];B[mb];W[oe]C[[I think tenuki would've been much better for me.  This was a poor attempt to kill the five black stones.\]

dede: p14 is better. Direct cut at n16 is promising too.];B[pe]
;W[of];B[pf];W[me]C[[I was thinking about a cut at N16, or saving the two stones and doing something towards the center.\]

dede: Now White created another weak group.];B[qg];W[rf]C[[I see now that my attacking groups are way too weak, and I lose sente in a bad way.\]]
;B[ne];W[nf];B[mf];W[md]C[[I went back to my plan of cutting and trying to kill the smaller group, but I'm too weak now.]
;B[pg]C[green42 [25k\]: oops
green42 [25k\]: hmm, never mind lol];W[ng];B[mg]C[Kas [17k?\]: yeah I think you should've captured instead]
;W[nh]C[green42 [25k\]: yeah lol];B[mh];W[kd];B[ld];W[le];B[lc]
;W[kf];B[kc];W[ke];B[ie];W[ic]C[[I don't really expect to cut, but rather make an extention and some territory.\]]
;B[jc];W[fc]C[[Exactly as I planned.\]];B[ib]C[dede: I'd try to make some base with d18, and run with f15]
;W[hb]C[[I think this move cost me lots of points.\]];B[hc]
;W[jb];B[id];W[ia]C[[I expected black to connect.\]];B[gb];W[if]
C[[I gave up the invasion, and went for center territory.\]]
;B[gd];W[gf]C[green42 [25k\]: you took my spot
green42 [25k\]: lol
Kas [17k?\]: of course :)];B[fd];W[mi]C[[I thought I would cause trouble for the three black stones and cut off the single stone.\]]
;B[ni];W[li];B[lj];W[ki];B[kk];W[nj];B[oi];W[nk];B[jk];W[ik]
;B[ij];W[il]C[dede: Usually, mistake. Now Black can play k11, threatening l12 if White connects at l10. Atari j11 should be first. But this is 8 handicap game, so White must take the risk.]
;B[hj];W[ii]C[[I don't much like this move.  What would be better?  Maybe E15 or something around D13 instead?\]
dede: slow, but necessary.];B[hi]C[Kas [17k?\]: bah, my last move was too slow :(]
;W[hh];B[fh];W[ef];B[df];W[cf]C[[I plan to make some territory, or maybe connect back to E14.  This move didn't work out so well.\]

dede: too late.];B[dg];W[cg];B[ch]C[green42 [25k\]: my set up feels shaky to me lol
Kas [17k?\]: that's my job :)];W[bi]C[[I thought I might help one of my weak groups with this move, but it didn't do anything for either one.  I should've thought about it more, instead of making a move while distracted.\]]
;B[bh]C[Kas [17k?\]: ok back
green42 [25k\]: oh, i thought you were back last move
Kas [17k?\]: nope.. let's see if I made a good move while distracted :)
green42 [25k\]: i didn't like your move, from black's view
green42 [25k\]: lol
Kas [17k?\]: I still have to figure out what to do with it :)
green42 [25k\]: it looks dangerous to me, i'm not sure why]
;W[bj];B[bl];W[bm]C[[What am I doing here?  Trying to cut a diagonal connection again??  Horrible move.\]]
;B[bn]C[Kas [17k?\]: oh I'm stupid. saw that response right after I played.
green42 [25k\]: i do that a lot];W[bk]C[[I don't know what I was thinking with these few moves.\]]
;B[cl];W[ah];B[ag];W[ai];B[bg];W[bo];B[an];W[ir]C[[Finally I tenuki.  Anything bigger than this?\]

dede: may be o4.

End of comments];B[jr];W[rg];B[rh];W[ri];B[rj]C[Kas [17k?\]: did it again :(
green42 [25k\]: i know the feeling too well];W[rk];B[si];W[rl]
;B[sm];W[ee]C[[I'm planning to push in one of these directions, but I didn't think much about the followup.\]]
;B[ed];W[de];B[ce];W[eg]C[[I'm just trying to cause trouble and reduce black's territory.\]]
;B[dh];W[eh];B[ei];W[dk]C[[I realized that the large black group only has one eye, and so these moves attempt to cut it off.\]]
;B[fk];W[fl];B[hm];W[hn]C[[Oops, I lost sente.  In these next few moves I lost much more center territory than I expected.\]]
;B[im];W[jl];B[jm];W[kl];B[km];W[lm];B[jn];W[io]C[[I completely missed the atari, and thought I was threatenting to cut.  But so what if I do?  I should've played M6 instead.\]]
;B[ln];W[nn];B[no];W[oo];B[op];W[gh];B[gi];W[fg];B[fi];W[hl]
;B[hk];W[ll];B[he];W[hf];B[ge];W[ao];B[am];W[ak]C[[I thought I might be able to do something with a snapback at G7, but the black group has too many liberties.\]]
;B[al]C[green42 [25k\]: i think i screwed this up
green42 [25k\]: maybe not
Kas [17k?\]: I think you're still ok, but it's close
green42 [25k\]: lol
Kas [17k?\]: I think my mistake on the second line saves you.
green42 [25k\]: where?
Kas [17k?\]: B7
Kas [17k?\]: the one you captured, making an eye.
green42 [25k\]: oh, yeah];W[rr]C[[At this point I know I've lost, but I give one more shot at capturing a large group.\]]
;B[rq];W[pr];B[qr];W[qs];B[or];W[pq];B[oq];W[ps];B[sq];W[so]
;B[os]C[Kas [17k?\]: I had to try
green42 [25k\]: hehe
green42 [25k\]: good practice for me
Kas [17k?\]: sorry to keep you waiting.. I'm looking to see if I can play Q19
green42 [25k\]: oh, i'll play o19 after that
green42 [25k\]: i don't think you'll put yourself in danger of being captured
Kas [17k?\]: but what if you played S18 instead?  I think I'm ok.. feeling risky for one point..]
;W[pa]C[green42 [25k\]: if i play s18, then you play o19
Kas [17k?\]: yep, but I didn't see it past that.
Kas [17k?\]: at least, not clearly.
green42 [25k\]: hmm, wow
Kas [17k?\]: let's see?
green42 [25k\]: do you want me to try?];B[rb]C[Kas [17k?\]: yeah
Kas [17k?\]: I think I've lost this game anyways :(];W[na]C[green42 [25k\]: you did your best]
;B[ma]C[green42 [25k\]: much better than i could anyway lol
green42 [25k\]: i think you play s19
Kas [17k?\]: yeah, T18 is disaster for me];W[ra];B[oa];W[sb]
;B[na]C[green42 [25k\]: that wasn't bad
Kas [17k?\]: it worked :)
green42 [25k\]: i'm not sure who gets more points either way
green42 [25k\]: or is it same?
Kas [17k?\]: otherwise I would've played S19 first, and you'd get an extra point on the 19th line.  Wasn't worth the risk, but I had to see.
green42 [25k\]: oh ok];W[js]C[[I really should've played M12 instead.  Is there any way I could have kept sente in the endgame?\]]
;B[ks]C[Kas [17k?\]: have some sente :)];W[is]C[green42 [25k\]: lol
green42 [25k\]: i don't have to defend at L2?
Kas [17k?\]: it's close, but I don't think so unless I play K5
Kas [17k?\]: if I play atari, you run to P1, right?
Kas [17k?\]: then I've got four stones looking stupid.
green42 [25k\]: lol ok];B[lh];W[kh]C[Kas [17k?\]: ack I forgot that was unresolved.
green42 [25k\]: i almost played another move there
Kas [17k?\]: play M14! :)
green42 [25k\]: lol];B[je];W[jf];B[sg];W[se];B[sl];W[sk];B[sj]
;W[ql];B[po];W[on];B[ok];W[ol];B[fe];W[ff];B[oh]C[green42 [25k\]: couple more moves then it's over i think
Kas [17k?\]: yep];W[lg];B[lf];W[kg];B[tt]C[Kas [17k?\]: that was gote, I should've played somewhere else maybe
green42 [25k\]: i think T14];W[jo]C[[I had played at T14 first, but when we reconnected to the server I didn't notice that move missing as well as this one.\]]
;B[kp]C[green42 [25k\]: i was saying how i should've played k5 before disconnecting lol]
