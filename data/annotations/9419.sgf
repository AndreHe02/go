C[Hi!

This is Joonas, I'll be reviewing your game, mostly from black's perspective. I'm currently ranked 1k EGF. Feel free to email and ask me if you have any additional questions!]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[op];W[pq];B[oq];W[qm]
(;B[kp]C[I think this is an OK place to play, as white's approach to J3 immediately would be too early and a bit gote.]
;W[iq]C[So white plays here. Also the invasion at N3 would've been premature in my opinion.]
;B[jq];W[ip]C[After this exchange, black group became stronger, and white side is still open.]

(;B[cn]C[Is this approach correct or would it be better to enclose one of my 3-4 points?

Joonas: Both are OK, personally I like the active way of reducing white's potential here.]
;W[co]
(;B[cq]C[Taking the corner is also an option, of course.];W[bo]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[eq];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[gr];W[hr]TR[fp]C[Is black already alive? I have to admit I'm not sure, but it already seems hard to kill black, so you could maybe play elsewhere already.

Because of the cutting point marked, white shape feels slightly bad here.]
;B[bp];W[gs];B[es];W[dn]
(;B[cm]SQ[ci][cj]C[I think I should have left this stone to die instead of extending.

Joonas: Yes, better way would be to wait until you have supporting stones nearby, after which there might be something. Also, white's tiger's mouth now makes attacking or cutting the white stones very hard.]
;W[ck]
(;B[dk];W[dj];B[cj]C[I would most likely play D9 only to get C7 stones out of trouble a bit quicker (see example variation) and not play the cross-cut unless I'm sure all variations are playable for black (hard to read all of them, though).]

(;W[cl]C[Also a good move for white, hard to find a good play for black anymore.]

(;B[di]C[Because you have the marked stones, you don't want to induce good moves for white. See variation.]
;W[ej];B[ei]LB[ci:A]C[This push is not feasible, because white can just atari at A (see variation). Black should have just connected.]

(;W[ek];B[bj]TR[ci]C[Connecting at C11 would make a better shape, but it's true that this threatens to save C7 stones (in gote, though)]

(;W[dl];B[df]LB[ec:B][fc:C][ed:A]C[This is too small, black feels very overconcentrated now. Better to play A-C and let white do a bad invasion here if he wants to.]
;W[qe]C[As white, I'd maybe play in top side, as it's hard to get points on right side.]

(;B[qg]LB[nd:A][ph:B]C[I would have considered A or B also. A would directly build black's biggest potential, the top side, and B would now require immediate strengthening. See the variations.]
;W[oe];B[qj]C[Black got a new group with 4 points, and white gets an attack against the corner, and severely limits black's top side potential. However, if black plays around A, R13 is very weak, which is the reason a less tight pincer was called for.]
;W[nc]LB[nb:A][qd:B]C[First instict moves for black are A and B]
;B[ob];W[nb];B[pd];W[pe];B[rd]
(;W[qd];B[qc];W[re]
(;B[sc]C[Ouch!];W[rb]C[After the corner dead, the game starts to feel very hard for black.]
;B[nd]C[The most obvious variation after this (the one played) has a non-working ladder in three moves, so it would've been better to not play there moves.]
;W[od]
(;B[oc];W[md];B[hc]LB[ec:D][oj:B][nm:C][lq:A]TR[qg][qj]SQ[kp]
[op][jq][oq]C[As white, I'd now attack one of the weaker black groups (some possible moves marked, C prepares to attack one or the other) or invade at D - just limiting black top left corner is enough to seal the game.]
;W[rc]C[And black gains a move :)];B[ie];W[ne]C[And black gains another move...]

(;B[kc]TR[bk]C[As said, this is quite small, around 6 points at most. Even B9 is about as big as this.]
;W[ph]C[Excellent choice by white.];B[qh];W[pj];B[pk];W[qi]
;B[ri];W[pi];B[rk]
(;W[ql];B[qk];W[sg]C[This is a useless move for white, as black can respond in sente or just ignore and jump away.]
;B[sh];W[rg];B[rh];W[om]C[Black has both jumping out and making an eye at S14 so if you feel you are behind, you could even tenuki here. But it's true that if you'd do that, white may benefit from your relative weakness.]

(;B[ok];W[mm];B[rl];W[rm]
(;B[sj]C[This is unnecessary...];W[mq]LB[pp:B][pr:A]C[I don't know how to deal with this here.

Joonas: This is a hard invasion, especially after white got the triangled stones in sente. The problem stems from L17 move which should've been spent in strengthening one of your weaker groups.

In a situation like this, I would be prepared to sacrifice one side or the other. Good questions to ask in this type of situation:

0) Is there a move that connects, and if it is gote, can I live after white plays one move after the connection?

Here, N4 seems like it could connect, but surviving after white gets K6 or something like that seems hard.

1) Can I take the corner or at least get forcing moves when threatening to do so?

In this case, black can get A and B in sente, they might help connecting.

2) Is there any other aji?

Here it seems F4 cut is the biggest aji, but not big enough to cause white too much trouble. Peep at O6 is possible, but I'm not sure if it helps]

(;B[mp];W[nq]C[Wrong direction for white. Now black gets a decent result]
;B[np]
(;W[or];B[lq];W[jn];B[kn];W[km];B[jo]C[In my experience, this shape usually creates more problems than it solves, playing M6 straight away is usually simpler. In this case, it might not make a difference, though.]

(;W[io]C[This is not a good idea for white.]
(;B[ln]
(;W[jp]C[Very bad move for white.];B[lm];W[kl];B[ll];W[ml]C[Another bad move, "squeezing the toothpaste". L9 would be superior to this as N7 stone is dame.]
;B[lk];W[ko];B[lo];W[jr]
(;B[kq]C[Slow.];W[lr]LB[ii:B][jj:A][bk:C]C[White should play elsewhere.]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[kr];W[ms];B[jo];W[im];B[mk];W[ff]C[I feel like I should have been able to kill this invasion.

Joonas: Yes it definitely feels doable. And black must kill it in any case, such a deep invasion by white when he's leading is giving black an opportunity to get back into game.]

(;B[hh];W[ec];B[ed]LB[fd:A]C["A" might also work, but this is less explosion-prone]

(;B[ch]C[In the beginning, white made several mistakes in the direction of play. Black could've gotten a solid load, but saving C6 stones and the reading mistakes that followed it made the game quite even at that point, especially since black played the somewhat small move of D14 with his sente.

White's suboptimal approach of R15 was a good place for black to build top side, but low pincer resulted first in some troubles and then in a dead corner, and after that the game was very hard for black. However, white made several inefficient moves which allowed black to catch up somewhat, but ignoring the two weaker groups made it possible for white to fix the remaining weaknesses.

Finally, there was hard fight after white's (unnecessary) invasion, which became very complex. After white won that, the game was over.

I think black had a good idea about direction of play, but read some situations a bit too quickly. With some additional experience through games, I'm sure you can easily become at least two stones stronger!]
;W[bi];B[bh];W[aj];B[jm]C[At this point, white has a lead of about 60 points. The rest is mostly yose and it should make at most 10 pt difference. No more comments after this.]
