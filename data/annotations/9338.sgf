AB[pd][dp][pp]C[forfun (hereafter 'ff') - I would like to thank Black for providing an interesting game for review. Black did well for a long time. Of course Black missed a key peep at the end of the game but before that there good places to study for improvement but there were also well considered moves that Black should do more of! :-)

Note that it can be very helpful to see the amount of time spent when we look at some of Black's choices. Were they played 'automatically'? Were they played after giving the situation some thought? Some of my comments refer to the amount of thinking time spent on a particular play.

By the way, I use the GoGoD database when I am reviewing, particularly regarding joseki. Some of my comments reference GoGoD. I think it is a good idea to consider how our play differs from that of professionals.

I think that key point in this game is when Black tries to start a fight in the top center of the board by attaching at M17. Clearly Black had an eye on this play since early in the game. However, that play did not really fit the situation that the game had evolved to by then. Black had built a nice framework on the bottom of the board and was ahead. A calm approach that enclosed the bottom while leaving the top to White would have been better. But Black had seen the tesuji and was waiting to use it!! I have this same kind of habit, once I see a play that I like, I can't let it go. This an extremely bad habit that has lost me many games! :-) You should lose it as soon as possible. Let's look at the game and see what I mean.]

(;W[de];B[jp];W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[qe];W[nc]
(;B[oc]C[ff - (3 seconds) You played this immediately, presumably according to your plan. However, this looks very passive here. Since the White position along the top is wide open. See the variation...]
;W[nd]
(;B[ic]C[ff - This is rather a mistake in direction IMHO. Black assumes that White is weak here but that is not yet the case. See the variation.]

(;W[kc]C[ff - White misses a chance here I think. See the variation.]

(;B[ec]C[ff - Rather invites the invasion. Alternatively Black could hold back. See the variation...]
;W[gc]
(;B[ee]C[ff - (4 seconds) Black gives up the corner. In the game Black concentrates on playing against the G17 stone but that idea misses the direction of play.]
;W[dd]
(;B[ed];W[dc]
(;B[jd]C[ff - The top does not look like the biggest issue here. See the variation...]

(;W[gb]C[ff - This is a mistake in direction. The last thing White should want to do is connect on the second line.]
;B[db]C[ff - The right direction. The corner is much bigger than the top]
;W[cb];B[eb]
(;W[ib]C[ff - The natural follow-up to the previous moves, but clearly a mistake. Black should not hesitate...]

(;B[jb]C[ff - (3 seconds) Why play this now since it does not separate White?]
;W[jc];B[id]
(;W[hb]C[ff - Bad shape. Better at H17 for threatening to separate Black.]
;B[df]C[ff - Good! Black keeps the original 3-stone advantage. Up to here if we look around, we can see that White has not made much headway against Black. So far White has made very little territory and built very little thickness.]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[be];B[bf];W[ce]
(;B[dg]
(;W[ge]C[ff - Because B13 is sente against the corner, White should probably capture the B14 stone instead of this...]

(;B[dk]C[ff - (22 seconds) So Black thought about this play however it is not quite right here. This misses making the proper shape at the top. In addition, since White can still capture B14, this is too close to D13.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm]C[ff - Notice that at this point the stone on D9, which was already oddly placed toward the top is now oddly placed toward the bottom left as well. :-)]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq]C[ff - Black should be a little dissatisfied with the result on the left. Nevertheless Black is not badly off here.]
;W[ok]
(;B[pi]C[ff - (7 seconds) This looks like an overplay. White is not that weak here. 

Black seems to decide that it is time ot change strategies from building Black positions to erasing White positions. This is always a dangerous bit of timing in handicap games. In fact, Black still has better territory-building opportunities than White here and should not rush to start fighting where White is stronger.l]
;W[qi]
(;B[of]C[ff - This does not fit with Q11 but see the variation...]
;W[ph]C[ff - By now, we should doubt the value of Q11. White becomes completely safe here. This means that in the future we will not be able to threaten these stones in the midst of fighting against any invaders of our bottom framework. Double attacks are the essence of Go. We should be reluctant to strengthen our opponent.]
;B[bg];W[bc]
(;B[qn]C[ff - This is a kind of standard shape, but not against P9. Rather it is for when White has come at least as far as P8 and is threatening to attach at R7 or invade at R6.]
;W[ff];B[ef];W[or]
(;B[pr]C[ff - (5 seconds) The point of this move is less to take the corner than to chase White. That strategy has its risks in a 3-stone game, since we expect White to be the better fighter.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[qq];B[qr];W[op];B[nq];W[qp];B[po];W[nr]
(;B[rr];W[mq]C[ff - Unfortunately this variation with the squeeze allows White to escape fairly easily.]
;B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[mo]
(;B[lr]C[ff - (9 seconds and 2 seconds for the follow up at K6) This is not the right time to peep here. See the variation...]
;W[nn];B[oo];W[mr]
(;B[jn]C[ff - If Black wants to play here, it is better to keep M2 in reserve.]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr]C[ff - It is better not to have the M2, N2 exchange on the board.]
;W[ls]C[ff - Luckily White takes gote here. Nevertheless, note how narrow the space is between the K3 wall and the F3 stone.]

(;B[lc]C[ff - (8 seconds) A turning point. What does Black want to achieve here? Where is the biggest part of the board?]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[ke];B[le];W[kb];B[lb];W[mb];B[la];W[ob];B[pb]
;W[nf]C[ff - The basic problem is that the J18 stones are alive and so are the R11 stones (notice the effect of the Q11, R11 exchange. So only the O16 White stones are at risk. But so are Black's M17 stones. Black's plan with M17 has not worked out so well.]
;B[mf];W[od]
(;B[pc]C[ff - (3 seconds) An automatic reply. But should Black have thought a little more?]
;W[ng]C[ff - Black's center stones are now weaker-looking than White's]
;B[kf];W[je];B[jf];W[ie]
(;B[oe]C[ff - 'Forces' White to fix a weakness without helping Black. P14 is not a critical stone unless White can be cut.]
;W[ne];B[lh];W[mh]
(;B[jk]C[ff - Poor timing. Black does not want to let White force in the center. Note that White has not made any real territory. White has two corners but so does Black and Black's are bigger than White's. In order to win, White needs to exploit some weak Black stones. The only candidates are in the center. If Black ensures their safety, this should be a victory for Black. This move feels more like Black is behind and needs more territory to catch up at the risk of leaving some weak stones to find a way to survive somehow.]
;W[fh]
(;B[bm]C[ff - Again Black chases territory. However, this is small since White can now press down from the center. And even if it is big, it is not urgent. The left side second line is not where the action is.]
;W[li];B[kh];W[jl]
(;B[ki]C[ff - Black played away with K9 originally. Why go back now?]
;W[kk]
(;B[kj];W[ik]
(;B[lk]C[ff - (4 seconds) This is not enough time spent thinking about giving your opponent a ponuki in the center of the board! Our first reaction has to be connect and then fight. Sacrificing the K9 stone should only come after long and careful reading. :-)]
;W[jj]C[ff - With this strong shape in the center and the Black stones at the top still unsettled, the game becomes more difficult for Black.]

(;B[mi];W[ni];B[mj];W[mg]
(;B[lf]C[ff - (46 seconds!!!) Possibly the worst Black play of the game! :-) The only thing this (instead of M13) does is stop White N15 from being sente. What does White N15 do for White? Absolutely nothing! See the variation...]
;W[rf]
(;B[oa]C[ff - (7 seconds)]
(;W[rd];B[re];W[se];B[rc];W[sc]
(;B[qd]C[ff - (2 seconds) More patience is needed. Black does not want to fight this ko!]

;W[rd];B[og];W[qc];B[oh];W[nh];B[oi];W[nj]
(;B[ma]C[ff - (7 seconds) Black seems to have been worn out by White's aggression and falls asleep here. See the variation...]
;W[nb];B[na]C[ff - Connecting in gote without making eyes is a disappointing result.]
;W[mk];B[lj];W[ll]
(;B[pg]C[ff - (73 seconds) Black's longest think of the game. Black uses the time to decide to live safely]

(;W[qh];B[qf];W[qb]C[ff - Anyway Black answers here. This is a big move for White but pretty slow. Black seems to have maintained a small lead.]

(;B[hi]C[ff - A little thin.];W[pm]
(;B[ml]C[ff - This idea should lose the game for Black. White does not find the right response IMHO. Black should be playing to enclose territory in the center instead...]
;W[nk];B[lm];W[kl];B[mn]

(;W[of]C[ff - White should have seized the opportunity to close Black into the corner. This raises the very real question of what Black will do if White plays into R17 next!

Note that if White plays here and Black responds, White no longer wants to play L17 next since it would now be too close to White strength. Instead White would naturally play from the other side at G17. So when White plays L17 first a later play here at P14 is relatively inefficient. Therefore it becomes easy for Black to respond in the corner to this play later.]

(;B[of]C[ff - This is natural in order to keep the two White positions separated and the pressure on. It is interesting that there are six games in GoGoD with this corner continuation: 3 pro games and 3 amateur games. All three pros continues with this P14. All three amateurs continued with various pincers along the top! :-)]

(;B[nd]C[ff - This is much more common in pro play and certainly looks more interesting here. Black keeps White separated naturally, which keeps pressure on the right side. It is way too early in the game to be concerned about a few points in the corner. Add this joseki to your repertoire!]
