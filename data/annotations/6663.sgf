C[K- this turns out to be a very close game, decided in the endgame. I think I took a lead early on, but allowed black to get a key move in to secure a large territory in the upper right, which brought it back to a close game - with me slightly behind I think. So I resorted to desperation tactics, which didn't really work but I managed to edge ahead anyway... so hopefully, there is plenty of material here for a review!

BruceWayne:  Hi guys.  Thanks for the opportunity to provide a review.  I need to preface all of my future comments by saying that although 3k is stronger than you two, I still don't consider myself to be very good.  So please take my comments at face value.  Also, I tend to focus on big picture ideas/strategies, rather than on individual moves.  Anyway, here we go!]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp]LB[dp:A][ep:C][eq:B]C[I don't prefer this move because it allows a B approach at B/C to work well from the lower right stone.  Locally, I would prefer A.]

(;B[qk];W[iq]
(;B[de];W[ci]TR[cg][dg][di]C[K- 3 point pincer to work as an extension from my bottom left corner, obviously only a mild threat to the black stone

BW:  In order to have the full effect of 'working' from your bottom left enclosure, you don't play closer to the enclosure, play all the way, such as the marked options.  Also, playing on the 4th line would be better in order to create a moyo.]

(;B[cg];W[ei]C[K- I was happy with this exchange

BW:  I would be too.  C13 shows that B is too concerned with his D15 stone.  At this point in the game, you need to play lighter and not commit so early.  See variation for B.]
;B[fd];W[fc]C[K- need to defend my corner stone now]
(;B[cd]C[BW:  Don't change direction!  See variation.];W[cc]
;B[bc];W[gd];B[fe];W[io]LB[gc:A]C[K- I thought for some time over this move, and I'm still not convinced I got it right. I did not want to invade the right side yet,  because black would be able to use his chinese opening to good effect. So it was a choice between the upper or lower sides. I chose this move in the end because it creates a problem for black (how to invade the lower left corner?) and it prepares the way for a kakari in the lower right.

BW:  Not a bad move locally, but you have left a huge weakness at A.  The following proverb helped me to gain roughly 3 stones:  "Play urgent moves before big moves".  "A" is the urgent move in this case - it makes your group secure.]
;B[gc]C[BW:  Ah, I see that B played it!];W[hc];B[gb];W[fb]
;B[hb];W[bb];B[bd];W[ab];B[eb];W[ec]TR[hc][gd]C[K- I'm confident of having a live group in the top left corner now, and providing I can keep the triangled stones somethng like safe, I can reduce the influence that black gets in exchange]
;B[hd];W[gi]TR[gd]C[K- allowing black to get this point would be very bad for my moyo, and if I try to extract the triangle stone instead, black can easily chase me around while getting key points such as this. I am worried about the top edge, but this move gives me a stronger position in the centre which I might be able to use to invade the top edge

BW:  Not bad reasoning.  However, your corner is still pretty open to a deep invasion, and you seem to have a lot invested in your corner.  I like how G11 counteracts the B wall though!]
;B[ge];W[po]LB[qo:A]C[BW:  Good locally.  Playing at A is a common mistake.]
;B[np]
(;W[no];B[mp]
(;W[qq];B[pp];W[qp];B[pr];W[ok]C[K- I was very happy to take this point, it is always a point that I aim for against a low chinese opening. If black gets it, my invasion group must run to escape while black just makes territory

BW:  Yes, a good point.  But your stones below it look scary to me.]

(;B[qn];W[pn]
(;B[qm];W[qo];B[mo];W[nn];B[mn];W[pl]TR[mn][mo][mp]C[K- black is building a strong wall here which is threatening my moyo, so I want to change direction and not lead him any further in making his wall stronger]
;B[pm];W[om];B[pk];W[oj];B[qi]TR[oj]C[K- I was happy with this exchange, squashing the territory black can take here]

(;W[eq]C[K- and with this move, I thought I had pretty much the whole bottom left quarter of the board as territory, but...

BW:  I would prefer one move higher.  Then B would have to choose between invading the two marked areas.  See variation.]
;B[ck]TR[cg]C[K- ....I had not accounted for this. Obviously one choice would be to cut it off from connecting to the marked stone and seek to kill the group that tried to live, but instead I chose to let it connect out and I would simply try to minimise the loss of territory

BW:  I would vote for option 1.  Cutting it off and gaining territory while attacking is good strategy.  See variation.]

(;W[cm];B[bi]
(;W[cj]LB[bh:A][bj:B]C[BW:  Instead play A or B.];B[bj];W[bh]
;B[ch];W[bk];B[bl];W[dk];B[cl];W[dl];B[bm];W[cn]LB[ak:B][bn:A]
C[K- so there it is, with almost 20 points lost and the potential for more if black plays here first in the future :-(

BW:  for the future, you have A as sente because it threatens B.]
;B[kq]LB[nd:A]C[K- seems not so big at first, but has obvious intentions of making this group totally safe and using it as a springboard to attack the open side of my moyo.... my priority is to come away from this local exchange with sente

BW:  I agree.  If I was B I would play around A instead of defending.]
;W[jr];B[kr];W[ph]LB[nc:A]C[K- I think this move is a turning point in the game. Before this I have built up a strong position, with territory in the lower left and a strong(ish) group in the lower right reducing black's territory. With this move I should be playing somewhere near A to prevent black making much territory in this area

BW:  I actually like this move because it threatens B group on the right.]
;B[nd]C[BW:  Black ignores your move, so now is the chance to press on the group on the right.  See the continuation.]

(;W[lc]TR[oc][ld][qd]C[K- so now I have to invade, no choice

BW:  I'm not sure how to comment.  Other options are marked.  Either way, R12 would help a lot with the invasion/reduction.]
;B[jc]LB[le:A]C[BW:  bad move.  Now A is obvious for W.  B should try to force W to live on the side since it was such a deep invasion, then use his thickness to hurt the W territoty in the lower left.]
;W[le];B[nf];W[nb];B[pb];W[lg];B[nh];W[pi];B[qh]
(;W[mm]LB[lj:A]TR[nh][qh]C[K- with black having the 2 marked stones, I am concerned about this white group being short of eye space

BW:  But you have at least one eye in the corner, and you can jump around A.  I think your move is slow.  See the variation.]
;B[kn]LB[pg:A][qg:B]C[BW:  B should play A or B for a big gain.]
;W[ql];B[rl];W[ol];B[rn];W[qr]C[BW:  This is slow.  What does it get you?]
;B[pg]C[K- argh, no!! I wanted to play here first! This is the key point I referred to at the start. I think I was ahead until this point.]
;W[if]LB[jm:A]C[K- making eyespace and centre moyo

BW:  As you see from the next move, A attemps to shut B in and gives you large prospects.  Your group above is not in much danger as it is out into the middle already.]
;B[in]C[BW:  This is what hurts.];W[jn];B[jo];W[hn];B[jm];W[hm]
LB[im:A]C[BW:  Why are you reluctant to start a ko?  To be honest, I haven't looked to see who has how many ko threats, but in general, you should not back down.]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[ho];W[go];B[gp];W[hq]LB[io:A]C[BW:  ABSOLUTELY 'A'.  B is toying with you because you seem intimidated.]
;B[jq];W[fp]LB[io:A]C[BW: Still, A.];B[mi]TR[kb][ob][qj][bn]
[ro][is][ps]C[BW:  Now is a good time to check the endgame situation.  B's move is horrible.  What is he accomplishing buy that space in the middle?  See the marked points.  They are all large endgame points - much larger than what B just did.  Try to appreciate this and you will become much stronger.]
;W[mj]LB[ro:A]C[BW:  Urrrgggg!  If living is your priority, take some territory with A!]
;B[ki]TR[jg][ih][kh][hi][li][hj][lj][hk][lk][il][jl][kl]C[K- there goes my centre moyo... too busy keeping weak groups alive

BW: The marked area was not going to become your territory - because B always had the current move plus encroaching from the bottom.  You should be playing the points I highlighted earlier.]
;W[jh];B[gg];W[ji];B[kj];W[jj];B[jk];W[ik];B[jl];W[ro]C[K- ok, both groups should be pretty safe now]
;B[qj];W[sn];B[rm];W[ps]LB[lc:A][pg:B]C[K- at this point I think black is slightly ahead (5 points?), having profitted from my weak invasion at A and with me not playing B in time. So I'm taking the chance to get in some sente moves that should swing the game back to being dead even

BW:  I count B with 60ish and W with 60ish!];B[os];W[qs];B[or]

;B[ef];W[fg];B[hh];W[gh];B[hf];W[ig];B[hg]C[K- maybe I have a slight lead now, but I still have a rather thin group to protect]
;W[ke]TR[je];B[kb];W[ir];B[hi];W[hj];B[kh];W[ks];B[ls];W[js]
;B[lr];W[qg]C[K- at this point the game is so close it could go either way, so I am going to try for a decisive blow in this top right area - maybe a live group, maybe connecting out, maybe capturing some stones - not sure yet, so I'll throw in some stones and see how black responds]
;B[pf];W[rg];B[rh];W[qc];B[qd];W[qb];B[pc];W[rd];B[re];W[pa]
;B[oa];W[ra]C[K- it seems unlikely black will let me live here, so I'll have to fight a ko to connect out

BW:  this is certainley successful for W.  Even if you lose the ko, you will get a big move somewhere else.]

C[BW:  good move.];B[mb];W[ma];B[ka];W[md];B[nc]C[BW:  in hindsight, making B play here is what allowed him to play P17 in sente.  oops!]
;W[la];B[qa];W[op]TR[sm]C[BW: You have to make a threat that B will answer - the triangled point.]
;B[oc]C[BW:  Now the ko is over.];W[oq]TR[sm];B[nq];W[oo];B[nr]
;W[na];B[pa]C[K- so, black won the ko, and overall the game is still so close it could go either way - so my gambit had failed, no decisive blow struck in the top right corner]

Black: 60 territories + 19 prisoners = 79
Result: W+5.5
K- and so it is over, and somehow I managed to edge ahead right at the end.
An interesting game, one to learn from. My desperate gambit in the top right achieved nothing in the end really, but fortunately didn't do any harm either.

BW:  If there is one thing that will really help your play it will be to pickup a book on the endgame.  Both B and W in this game were pretty poor - for some reason, players at your level think there is a lot of territory to be had in the middle of the board - there isn't!  it's all on the sides in the endgame.  

In regards to the middle game, reread my comments and just play more.  Your current style reminds me of my own when I was your strength.  You like moyos! What allowed me to become stronger was to realize that moyos are not for surrounding territory, they are for attacking!  You make your profit by attacking, even if the attackee lives.

Thanks, and enjoy playing!
