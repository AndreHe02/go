C[This is a practice game I played too see how well I can play against a 6k and played really bad.

The main thing that happen was that I got overconcentrated but I tried to think as much as I could in this game please offer advice on this and other things that occured in the game thanks.

Hi, I'm dn21death on KGS. I'm 1 dan. :P Please since I'm only 1 dan don't take everything I say as totally correct but try to use it to guide you in a good direction I guess. :D
One of your main problems is that your stones didn't accomplish enough. You barely had any territory or influence the whole game.
Even though you played low, your overconcentration in some places made it so the territory you had didn't compensate for the amount of stones you had in that area. You also had very slow moves sometimes. The game pretty much ends when B gets his top and bottom left territory.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[ep];W[dc];B[ce];W[cg];B[df]C[I was checking and this isn't even joseki as far as I've seen, though it's talked about in whole board thinking of joseki by Yilun Yang though I don't have the book. :P]
;W[dg]C[This is probably a move of instinct. I would probably play it but the more I look at the continuations, the more it looks bad. 
For this move though since I don't know the kosumi here by B that much please don't think I'm totally correct. :P]
;B[ff]
(;W[fd]C[This was a bad move b isn't really under attack you should of played a more solid move.]

You should of played on that side first :P]

;W[rb];B[pb]C[Lots of continuations.]
(;W[rc]C[Slow move.];B[ld];W[of]C[You should of just jumped out or played Q15 first instead of playing S17.]

;B[bm]
(;W[bk]C[More important moves.

Play at bottom is big.
In the end B's biggest territory came from bottom left and it looked pretty nice.]
;B[hq]C[You might want to play under to get some territory and take some away from B.]

(;W[ip];B[hr]
(;W[ir]C[again over concentrated

If your going to move up with j4 i don't know why you went back down. Hane under  would of probably been better.]
