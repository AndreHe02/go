C[Even though I (Black) won, I felt as if I missed good replies, or at least better replies, to many of W's moves.

I have included some (too many?) questions where I wasn't sure about how to play.
The record stops after only 79 moves, but there should already be many mistakes to correct...

MR: Please find my comments starting with MR.

MR: My main comment is that you tend to leave weak opponent groups on their own ... not taking initiative to chase them ... but instead leaving the initiative to your opponent so that he/she can push you around ... I indicated some specific points in the review. My advice would therefore be to step back every now and then and to ask yourself what you really want ... and encourage you to tenuki sometimes ;-)]

C[W10 seems strange -- contacting my out-numbered stone.

MR: You are right. Normal ideas would be a pincer against M3 or L4.]
;B[kp];W[lo]
(;B[ko]TR[jq]C[Should I have just played at the marked
 point?
MR: I think both methods are ok here.];W[kn];B[jn];W[hq]C[So B should have made some kind of third line move, earlier?
MR: I guess you simpy can't get everything ...];B[io]
(;W[ml];B[km]C[Was this just aji-keshi?
MR: I tend to vote for aji-keshi ... After N8 it is not urgent for white to play L7, and so it is not urgent for black to play there either.]
;W[ln];B[cj];W[cg];B[cn];W[qg]C[MR: In my opinion, white should first settle the situation in the lower left corner.]
(;B[qh]C[Was this wrong direction, since W could just jump in at R8 anyhow?

MR: ... and likewise black should punish the white tenuki in the lower left ...

Besides: R12 is *not* the right point even when answering to R13 directly. Why directly contact and thereby strengthen the invading stone?]
;LB[ql:a];W[ph]C[MR: This move mainly helps black to fix his weaknesses by answering at R11.]
;B[qi];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc]LB[qg:a]
[ph:b]C[I was pleased that this was blunting the
influence of the W wide shimari on the upper left, and isolating W's two marked stones.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc]
(;B[qe]C[I wasn't sure where to play B39 -- I didn't
want to contact what looked like weak W stones,
in fact probably junk stones.

MR: My first idea is R14, as W S13 does not work.];W[of]C[A weak W group to attack, I thought.]
;B[nj]C[Separating upper from lower.];W[im]C[MR: "Don't peep where you can cut."]
;B[jm];W[jp]C[MR: I can't really follow white reasoning ...]
;B[jq];W[mj];B[ni];W[oe]
(;B[rg]MA[mc][nc][oc]C[I thought the three marked B stones would
survive a W cut, and keep W's poor group hemmed in.

MR: If you reason that the three stones can survive, than you need also think that the whole group would survive when connecting at P16 ...]
;W[ng];B[mi]C[Leaning.];W[le]
(;B[mb]C[I knew this is not sente against W's
corner, but I wanted to prepare for a third line extension.   What should I have done instead?  Should the cut have been protected much earlier?

MR: Why not play the third line extension directly? 
N18 looks strange ... and heavy.];W[ip]C[Wishing I had played a B stone at W54 much earlier.]
;B[jo];W[ho];B[il];W[hm];B[jk]C[Trying to make eye shape, or maybe connect eventually with B's right side group.
But looks very fishy.  What should I have done?

MR: Now white looks rather strong in the lower left and the black shape at the bottom is heavy.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[qr]
(;B[rq]C[Did I have to answer? At that point?

MR: The local answer ist S2. And it should be played to maintain the balance of power between the white group around O5 and the black groups surrounding it.]
;W[jb]C[Drat!

MR: You allow yourself being pushed around too much. 
This is a good opportunity to step back for a second and to think about where you really *want* to play. 
Is the white group in the lower right already alive? (ok, this question would be more valid if black would have played S2 instead of S3) 
How about a leaning attack against the M15 group, thereby getting territory on the top? ... or alternatively a strong attack against the M15 group?]
(;B[kc];W[jc];B[kd];W[lg];B[ki];W[bl]C[This W move looks very strange.
MR: Agree];B[cl];W[bn];B[bm];W[fh];B[eb];W[db];B[dc];W[ec]
(;B[ed]C[I ultimately captured a large W group many moves later; but it felt like W's errors and not my skill, so stopping here seemed like enough for a review.

Thank you.])
