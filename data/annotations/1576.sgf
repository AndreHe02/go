C[I don't play go for about one month, since I didn't win a game for
one month. But it seems I have improved! Maybe all I need is just a rest.

Comment for game:  Black needs to focus more on letting opponent live, and less on attack.  It seems to me that in several occations, black attacked, and white got the advantage because of it.  If black learns to build a framework early on, and let white attack, then blacks fighting skills will really pay off.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq]C[---> say hello];W[dd];B[do]TR[qo]C[RR:  Usually better to enclose your own corner before attacking opponent.  Play somewhere around R5 is good]
;W[dl];B[eq];W[er];B[ep];W[gr];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[fq]C[Umm... is this a joseki? or there are better ways?

RR:  I don't know joseki.  However, if it was a joseki, then black would want to extend along the left side.  However, since there is a white stone at D8, this is a bad exchange for black.  Instead of C3, play at F2 to either cut apart white, or take a big corner.]
;B[go]C[RR:  I think I would have played at D10, pincering the white stone on the left side, then attack the upper left corner.]
;W[hp];B[kq]C[RR:  In the beginning, look to find the most empty side on the board.  In this case, a move on the right side is bigger than the played stone.

A go professional once told me that in the beginning, look for the biggest empty spot on the board, and play there.]
;W[ho];B[fm];W[gn];B[fn];W[fo];B[gm]TR[eo]C[RR:  I would have used this move to atari from E5, and connect my stones.]
;W[gp];B[il]C[B has to get out. But the group could be cut, right? <VAR>

RR:  If you are worried about life, then play along the edge to secure eye space.]

(;W[di];B[cf]TR[pk]C[RR:  So much open space on the right side and the left side.  Let white live (a little) and try to let black live bigger!  I would definatly play on the right side right now.  A Huge moyo if black plays around  Q9.]
;W[jc];B[fc]C[RR:  Instead of black attacking white, if I look at this position, it is two weak black stones attacked and split by white.  Instead, jump into the corner?  Hard to choose.]
;W[fd];B[cc]C[<VAR>]
(;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce];W[df]C[Hmmm... I'm not sure about this one. Should it be like... <VAR>?]

(;B[ec];W[db];B[gd];W[fe];B[hc];W[nd];B[lc];W[ld]
(;B[jb]C[Connect them, or... <VAR>

RR:  If you can connect them, that is always good.  However, the 4 stones on the left side a looking a bit weak right now.]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[mc];B[pf];W[lb];B[qk]C[I'm drawing his attension... :)]
;W[cb]
(;B[bh]C[<VAR>

RR: This move has less problems for black, because it has less weaknesses.]
;W[bi];B[ch];W[ci];B[dg]C[Too heavy?

RR:  No.  I like this move.  If you don't play here, you need to hane at B18, and white connects.  This (or D12) is the right move.]

;W[rf];B[qc];W[od];B[oc];W[oi];B[oh]TR[pj]C[Fight! Is this an over move?

RR:  Yes, I think so.  a Play at Q10 is more solid.];W[qi];B[pj]
;W[rh];B[oj];W[ni];B[mk]C[I decided to abandon those two.

RR:  no other choice :(

However, Black is making a nice moyo in the lower right.  Notice that there are ZERO white stones in the lower right quarter of the board, and black has 5 stones.  If white plays down there, black should make white's life very hard.]
;W[lo];B[mp]TR[jo]C[RR:  When black is strong is the time to start a fight.  It seems that black is too focused on territory.  Not letting white make any, and taking only what black can get.  In this case, a move to cut white is called for.  I would play at K5 and make white try to live.]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[mo];B[np];W[nn];B[jo]C[RR:  Good.];W[kl];B[kk]

RR:  At this point, White is safe on each side, and black may have two eyes (needs a follow up in the corner I think).  Maybe this isn't a good idea either.]
