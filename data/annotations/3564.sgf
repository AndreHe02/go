Often D16 is responded to R16. The idea to be to come down on the komoku (3-4 point) from above. Please see variation.]
;B[de]TR[qd]C[jocelyn [7k\]: c un mal courant

To me, blacks moves are conflicting. The black triangle stone says he is interested in the right edge. The black circle stone in the upper left says he is interested in the left center.

If he likes the triangle, then the black circle stone in the upper left should be another komoku, or expecting to follow up with black five on the upper edge, the hoshi (4-4 star) point would work.

If he likes the circle stone, black triangle should have been a hoshi point or other center oriented move.]
;W[dq]TR[de]LB[co:A][do:B]C[Here the white circle stone is not so good. It is inviting an approach from black at A or B. Black A or B flattens the white stone at the same time it works well with is left center oriented triangle stone.]

(;W[dc]LB[oc:A]C[This white move looks good, but I am not so sure. First, look at the next move to see why.

You could leave the left side open and play A. see variation]

(;B[gc]SQ[qd]TR[de]C[Should i separate the two black stones, instead of playing the pincer ? Maybe this play solidifies black too much on the top side ?

This is a bad black play. It does not support the triangle stone,  and the black square stone is oriented away from the black circle stone. See the variation.

But the question is what to do now, and that is a good one. Hmmmm. I don't know, I am sorry. Your play may have worked out just fine. Trying to separate may have allowed him to build a strong wall around D15 - F15.]

Yes, you have to make an approach at the circle stone or C. If you defend the upper left black at the circle stone is huge. However, don't forget you are leaving the upper left corner very vulnerable and at the first chance you get you must come back and play at D or (my preference) E.]

The stone along the top would have been best a move earlier. =) Here, I might try a high pincer such as A or B.]

Maybe a stone too early, you might try to play out towards the center first, and keep from getting shut out of the center. Then come back one or two move later for the circle stone.]

I second that, you have done a good job in the late middle game to reduce him.

Your strong point is certainly in the middle to early end game. Work on understanding how stones relate to each other in the opening. Stones far away in the beginning still have a huge impact later on.

You seem to like a territory game, as oppossed to a moyo (framework) game, so concentrate on openings that will allow you to do that.

I hope you found this helpful. =)

Kevin

 A black pincer is not so good because the black triangle stone is exerting influence down to the left and does not support a black pincer at A, B or even C.

 Future expansion is limited for black down along the left side because of the white square stone. White has a slightly more open area along the upper left.
