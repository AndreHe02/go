Hospice [22k\]: hello];W[cf];B[ci];W[ch];B[di];W[cd];B[ed]C[D17 instead would give you more defense while also being a threat to the corner.]
;W[ef];B[de]C[Too slow and heavy (stones are all grouped and easier to capture) C17 Would have been much better here and put pressure on his corner :)]
;W[cc];B[ce]C[Slow move for no territory gain and still not much room to form a base easily if you were attacked from the left side.]

;W[eh];B[ei];W[mc];B[jc]SQ[cc][bc][cd][eb]TR[ae][bd][bf][ce]
[de][dd][ed][gd][df]C[A bit stretched, you could have attacked the group in the top left corner to make sure it can make its eyes while at the same time strengthening your black group and securing a pair for yourself. It would give you sente.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[pe];B[oe]C[This just gave away your valuable corner. Keeping their group split with r16 would likely be beneficial.]

[fh:2][dm:3][jq:4][cm:5][pj:6][qn:7][cn:8]C[This move doesnt do anything beneficial. You should use your sente wisely.

1. Check for your weak groups that need support that could be in trouble.

The square group needs an eye.

The circle group needs a base, it can be attacked from below.

The cross group could be pincered if N15 is played by white to reactivate that one stone.

2. Check for their weak groups that you can attack.

Group 1 is heavily pincered and could likely be killed if attacked using for example marker 2. and meeting your stones up with the square group.

3. If you have no attack or defense moves that relate to the current board positions, then make a big move that will stake a claim on the board and get you big points.

3,4,5,6,7,8 for example.];W[qe];B[qf]LB[qh:1]C[too low and close to his wall to be effective, the position marked 1 would be better for breathing. Still  you have sente, so the previous applies. remember not to make weak groups that only strengthen him.]
;W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[nf]LB[me:1]C[A very dangerous hane, i added the variation in move 43 to show you what could have happened.

Instead you should have made the move at 1.]

;W[jb];B[jd]LB[kc:2][hc:1]C[H17, l17 something that is useful at the same time as strengthening that weak stone :)]

well thats all yours, so you want to push as close to white as you can to maximise it. The points marked are no-ones now, where as if you moved your stone over you could have claimed at least 3 or 4 more points.]
;W[bk];B[bj]SQ[ei][dh][di][ci][bh][bi]LB[bm:1]C[when you get attacked like this, always pincer it without directly attacking, it cant live in this space, meaning it cant make two eyes. so let it choke itself, which it will :)

so playing at 1 would have been much better. This group is safe because of d9 connecting you too the other side. in the bottom.]

:comment: if you lose on time, its because you didnt have enough. Otherwise it usually gets to the point where both people pass as no further points could be gained at which point the scoring begins :)

Anyway, this was a really fun game for me. I have no idea how I got away without losing any stones.

:comment: its better to lose stones than to lose  large points just remember that.

Is it possible to score this game?  Had we continued playing, who would have won?

(Thanks in advance!)



:comment:
I scored the game for you and White wins by 9.5 points.

I threw some end game variations in there for you to look at by the way that would have gained you a lot of points. 

I would recommend reading some books or watching some videos. There are some great ones on youtube.

All in all though a good effort. I am glad that you had fun and i hope that you enjoyed my review.]
