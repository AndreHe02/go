C[JM: Thank you very much for the opportunity to review your game!  This was an exciting match due dominated by a series of running battles between weaker groups.  In the end, black's patience, in the face of white's over-agressiveness allowed black to get the win.

I think the most important point demonstrated by this game regarding black's play was a greater need for understanding of life and death.  1) Given that there were so many weak groups, it is important to have a good sense of which groups are in severe danger, and which groups can survive with less help.  (ex. Q14) Also 2)Improving his notions of shape, especially running shape (ex. N10) would be beneficial to blacks play.  3) Finally, games like this demand good close-fighting skills, which problem-solving practice can improve.

All of my comments are preceded by 'JM:'.  Please take them with a grain of salt, as only the professionals can say with certainty what the best move in a position may be.]

;W[iq];B[cn]C[JM: I'm not entirely certain this is the right move, but at this stage, there are a lot of options.  Turning the corner at P9 could help you to continue building a framework on the top.  It would also put more pressure on the Q5 stones.

Alternatively, playing something around C12 could let you put pressure on the D16/14 stones and build strength to then counteract the lower corner.]
