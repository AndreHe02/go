C[Hello, I'm Joose, 9k* in NNGS. This is a game of mine against two stones stronger

player.   - Mattias@NNGS and HarryT@NNGS helped me out with this review. /Anarchrist]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de];W[dh]C[From here on there are a huge number of joseki to choose from...
Here is one variation which is quite common.]
(;B[cc]C[I'm not sure about this sequence. Without pincer in D12 I think it would be joseki,

but now...
- As you point out, C17 is not joseki in this situation due to D12.]
;W[cb];B[cd]LB[fc:A]C[Now W should play as in the variation. The reason is that W at A gives black easy life through variation 2.]

(;W[fc]C[Now black gets easy life.]
(;B[jc]LB[bb:A]C[Better safe than sorry... To play at A is *HUGE*.]
;W[bb]C[Good move! Black is in trouble.];B[fe]C[Sad since this doesn't do much of anything other than trying to keep B out of trouble.]
;W[ed]LB[ef:A]C[Ajikeshi. Premature since the peep at A might be useful at a later stage.]
;B[ee];W[hd];B[je]C[Maybe H15 would have been better?


-Completely wrong direction. Black's focus should be on the top left corner group!]
;W[hf]C[Perfect.]
(;B[fg]C[Slow slow slow.];W[dk]C[Good move.];B[gd]C[useless move?

- Hard to say, it becomes complex. If it works, fine. If it doesn't it probably has eliminated some potential that might be useful at a later point (ajikeshi).]
;W[gc];B[id]
(;W[ge]LB[he:A]C[Bad atari. White should just connect at A.]
;B[fd];W[ic]LB[hc:A]C[This should probably be at A.];B[gf];W[he]
;B[hg]C[White suffers. This is an excellent result for black.]
;W[ie]LB[ig:A]C[OUCH! This limits whites movability. Should be at A. This atari serves no purpose.]
;B[jd];W[ig];B[hh];W[ib];B[jf];W[if];B[nc]MA[lb][mb][lc][mc]
[kb][kc]LB[pc:A][oc:B]C[rather a move to right side?

-Over concentrated, and still an open skirt. The marked points don't become blacks territory unless black plays another move. The corner is also a bit fragile. White can for example invade at A. Playing at B seems better if black wants to play in this area.]

(;W[np]
(;B[oo]C[This doesn't secure the corner and it strengthens white.]
;W[jq]
(;B[fq]C[Overplay.];W[eq];B[fp]C[Slow...];W[dn];B[ip]C[Ouch. Strengthens white too much!]
;W[jp];B[jo]LB[io:A]C[I think this was a bad move.

- Triple ouch! Should be at A. White becomes much stronger through this anyway.]
;W[io];B[hp];W[in];B[ko];W[lp];B[gm]LB[gn:A]C[Too loose. Should be at A.]
;W[mn];B[nm];W[qo];B[ql]C[Q7 better? R7?

- This is ok.];W[on];B[rp]C[Ow! Too passive. Black has to cut and put up a fight.]

;W[nd];B[od];W[ne];B[of]C[P15 would be better I think.

-P15 good.];W[oc];B[pc];W[ob];B[nb];W[oe];B[pd];W[pe];B[qe]
;W[pf];B[og];W[pg];B[oh];W[ph]C[Black can kill. See the variation.]

(;B[ni]C[Is solid connection better?

- Solid connection most definitely better.];W[qi];B[qj];W[pj]

(;B[cq]C[This invasion looks okay since the top left group is stable now. White won't get much use out of the thickness he'll get after the invasion.]
;W[cp];B[dq]MA[qj][qi][qk][pj][pi][pk]LB[bp:A]C[Now, the game will be over if black gets to the marked area first!  White *has* to end in sente and stop white from getting a pon-nuki around A.]

If black cuts, white should be able to handle the situation.]

Now white has to play something silly like B.
Otherwise, if W tenukis...];W[po]C[Badly timed tenuki.];B[hc]

If W plays like this...];W[kd];B[nc]MA[oc][od]C[Black will probably close the corner in a manner similar to this, one any of the marked points.]
