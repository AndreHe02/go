C[I hope my review helps in developing your game.

Philip];B[ee];W[df];B[gc];W[ec];B[fg];W[ef];B[ff]C[I really wasn't sure what to do here.

This is ok, otherwise your stones are cut.];W[dd];B[cc]LB[fd:B]
[fe:A][dh:C]C[I don't know if this was dumb or not

OK, but the timing could be better, you still have a lot of cutting points cfr. the sequence in the game. You can also play at C.]

;B[cd]C[at this point i think i am doing ok

Actually, this was a losing move. Sorry.];W[hb]C[This is the killing move for what I'm conserned. Ignoring the F8/G8 exchange was a mistake (see the different variations).]

(;B[hc]C[probably the wrong response];W[ig];B[if];W[db];B[gb]
;W[ga];B[ib]C[its around now that i realize how dead I am but I was probably dead before

Indeed, see earlier.];W[ha];B[ic];W[ih];B[de];W[ce];B[de];W[ci]
;B[fh]C[Too late now, this had to be played earlier, cfr. the variations.]
;W[fi]LB[fb:A][gb:B]C[I hope I answered all of your questions. The marked exchange was the most important problem, my advice is to always read these sequences out because ignoring one can have devastating consequences.

Greetings,
