AB[dd][pd][dp];W[pp];B[qc]C[When you play with handicap, your main idea must be to attack white, to get thickess or territory or even better both. Not to kill, if you kill fine, but it is not advisable to risk everything trying to kill white because as he is stronger, usually, is white the one who kills.

Anyway r17 is a really slow and small move at this time.

There are plenty of moves to play like r6, k16, d10, o3.];W[fq]
C[The usual first moves in the opening are:

First in the corners
Second approach at the corners or corner enclosure
Third extension along the sides];B[cn]C[Good move :)];W[iq]
C[Usually white first play at d2, black c3 and then extension to j3.]
;B[ck]C[C9 is not a bad move, but it is small. The LL corner is quite safe, so a two space extension is small.

It is very important to keep the iniciative or sente in the opening, and c9 dont attack white nor stake big territory for black.

Better moves: k16, r6, q10, e3];W[jd]C[This is a good move by white, playing between the two black corners. This way black cant make a really big territory in the upper side. It is very safe also, because if black attack from one side, white can extend to the other.]
;B[pj]C[Good move on territory terms, but it is more important to attack white, so he cant make territory or attack black.

Better moves at h16 or near, attacking white and starting a big territory at the left side.]
;W[ql];B[qj]C[Not bad, but is still better attack white.];W[ol]
;B[md]C[That is a good move. :)

It makes two things, attack white and makes territory in the right side.]
;W[fc];B[cf]C[Not bad, but as c9 is low on the side, it is better to play it high at d14 to keep balance.]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[jk];B[og]C[Good move for territory :)];W[ch]
C[Until now, the game was peaceful, each player making his territory. But now white invades and fight start.

Whatis important now, is that white is *very* weak between two *strong* black positions, so black must attack. While attacking black must get territory or thickness to attack white at other parts of the board.]
;B[eh]C[E12 is one of the typical attacking moves, the capping.

But the capping has one weak point, d13.

Probably was safer to attack with a knights move at e13.];W[dg]
C[White exploits the black weakness.];B[dh]C[D12 is an attacking move, but a bad one because it help white to get stronger.

Probably c13 was better to keep the pressure on white.];W[cg]
;B[df];W[eg]C[Now white is out into the center and strong, so he may try some tricks while black who was strong is weak. It should be the opposite.]
;B[fg]C[I think it is better to attack white from the other side, at e14 getting stronger at the corner.]
;W[ef];B[ff]C[The other side is the important one. Black has now an important cutting point at f13.]
;W[ee];B[ed];W[fd];B[fe]C[Black has cut white, but he is weak, so white can attack also.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[dj];B[cj]C[Good move.

It forces white to connect while helping a black weak stone.]
;W[ci];B[ej];W[dk];B[cl];W[ek];B[gj]C[The only move for black.

But looking to the whole secuence, white is now attacking a weak black group when at the beggining was black the attacker.]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[gl];B[ij];W[hl];B[ie];W[id];B[he];W[hd];B[ld]
;W[kc];B[ki]C[Black is safe now, and has mapped out a territory, but white is stronger and has got territory at the top also.]
;W[bf]C[Now white start to attack black weak corner.

This is one of the usual tactics, attack one group and with the new strengh attack another near group.]

(;B[de]C[d15 is a bad move because it makes bad shape at the corner. Look at the variation in the previous move.]
;W[db];B[cc];W[bd];B[be];W[ae];B[bg];W[ce];B[cd];W[bh];B[be]
;W[ag];B[bc];W[ad];B[ac];W[af];B[cb];W[eb];B[ba];W[ab]C[Black is dead.

This is the result of  a bad attack. The group got strong and he kills instead of being killed.]
;B[nq]C[O3 is a difficult move because it is played where white is really strong.

White can attack it very hard, so it would be really dificult to live for black.]
;W[lq]C[M3 is a really good move for white because it is both an extension from j3 and a pincer. This is the kind of moves that we must try to play always.

Now the better option for black is to enter at r3 in the corner and live in sente. See Variation]

(;B[no];W[pr]
(;B[qq]C[Bad move.

Black is weak here. He must put all his efforts trying to get a viable group here so invading again and getting two weak groups are too much. At least one of the groups if not both will die.

If you wanted the corner you should have to invade earlier.

See variation on previous move.];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn]
;B[qr];W[rn];B[sp];W[rr];B[qs];W[rq];B[rp]C[Black is dead and has lost the iniciative.

When he kills you, you must play at other part of the board. Well, if you notice it ¡]
;W[oo];B[mn];W[ml];B[gp]C[White is strong, so he will attack.]
;W[fp];B[go];W[fo];B[gq]C[Again black is weak into the area where white is strong.]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[nr];B[jq];W[ip];B[jp];W[io];B[mr];W[mq];B[or]
;W[ps];B[mp];W[oq];B[ns];W[lr];B[jr];W[ir];B[ko];W[np]C[Black has got a ko. Not bad.]
;B[op];W[fj];B[fi];W[np];B[ah];W[ai];B[op];W[gi];B[fk];W[np]
;B[hn];W[in];B[op];W[fh];B[gh];W[np];B[jm];W[im];B[op];W[cq]
;B[np]C[Black still had ko threat at the LR corner at s1 and t2. But probably was bigger to connect the ko, because he was open at c3, so white could invade when he want.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[fn]C[F6 connect black stones to the corner, but after the white invasion, the whole corner is very weak, so a reinforcement was necessary.]
;W[al]C[See variation for making life.]
(;B[fl]C[Even after the white attack black is worried about his bottom stones, but that means disaster for the corner.]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[el];B[em];W[en];B[fm];W[dn];B[eo];W[ep];B[cm]
;W[do];B[co];W[eo]C[See variation for killing the white j2-j7 stones]

(;B[er]C[e2 is an overplay.];W[fs];B[kl]C[Black is trying to attack the right group but not with the proper move.]
;W[ik];B[hj];W[jl]C[To have any chance of capturing white, black has to connect at l7.]
;B[ll];W[km];B[is]C[J1 is bad because it is not where the important fight is.]
;W[jn]C[White is now almost safe.];B[lm];W[kn]C[See variation for how keep on attacking]

(;B[lo]C[m5 is not needed, white cant connect or cut black.]
;W[hm]C[Two eyes for white.];B[je]C[Good move for making territory at the center, but closing the center is usually very difficult.

Probably was better to play at n18 and keep the iniciative.]
;W[ni]C[white reduce the black center];B[nj]C[o10 is the weak point of the white shape]
;W[mj];B[mi];W[oj];B[nk];W[oi];B[mk];W[ok];B[ph]C[Well played by both.]
;W[lk];B[lj];W[nl];B[mj];W[nh];B[mg]C[good move :)];W[ng];B[nf]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[of];B[ne];W[pf]C[Now it is white who is making a weak group where black is strong. He could not expect for a good result unless black is tricked.]
;B[pg];W[qf];B[qg];W[rf];B[rg];W[pi];B[qi];W[rd];B[rc];W[qd]
;B[sf]C[Black is ahead in this fight.];W[ob]C[This is a good white invasion because has two posibilities:

Connect with n18
Cut at q17];B[lb]C[Black prevent the connection, but then white cuts.]
;W[pc];B[pb];W[oc];B[od];W[qb];B[rb];W[pa];B[sd];W[nb];B[mb]
;W[na]C[White has skifully lived.];B[qa];W[ra]C[Final Ideas.

Black dont used his handicap stones to attack white at the beggining, letting white to establish groups easily.

Later black attacked but didnt have clear ideas and over extended so white divided and killed him.

Studying life and death should help to improve a lot, because several big mistakes along the game were made, both attacking and defending.

Of course these are only my ideas and being myself pretty weak i may be wrong.]
)
(;B[hm]C[The only posibility for black is to make the j8 eye false.]
;W[ln];B[mm]C[White cant connect to the outside or make two eyes, so is dead.]
;W[kj];B[lj]C[white is dead.]))
(;B[ik];W[il];B[jl];W[kk];B[lm];W[ll]C[White group is trapped.]

;W[dm];B[dn];W[cm];B[bm];W[em];B[ao]C[Black is alive, but white can cut off the bottom stones]
))
(;B[lp]C[Instead of invading, black should reinforce his group.

One of the usual move for that is m4.];W[kp];B[lo];W[ko];B[mq]
;W[kq];B[mm]C[That would be what black should hope for.]))
(;B[qq]C[If black enters at r3 ...];W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[pr]
;W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[qn];W[pn];B[qm]C[That would be the usual result if black invades at r3. He gets the whole corner, but white is more than happy because he gets a really big territory outside.]
