Hi I'm Ben and about 9 kyu KGS, my adversary was a friend of mine, Martin 8 kyu KGS. This was played on Dave Peck's so we had some time to think between plays, but we managed - especially I! - to make some hefty mistakes nonetheless. I think my Fuseki went pretty well, but somehow I lost track of my objective during a chase and I managed to win only after some nerve-wracking yose exchanges at the end. We're two generally rather peaceful players.

<White>
But I would add that Ben is anxious to develop some attacking skills – I am not sure he likes being a "peaceful player" –, while I am satisfied with the general defensive orientation of my play.

<Black and White>
Thanks for reviewing!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi! I'm Saurus, 3 kyu on KGS.

I have reviewed this game for both sides.

This was a wonderful game to review. There were very few blunders, but rather some strategical errors from both sides, which I have discussed in detail. Your own inputs gave me insight into your way of thinking, and it was much easier to review that one with no comments from the players.

Wherever I have offered variations on a move, I have marked [SEE VARIATION\] in my comments.

The way I have reviewed this game is from my understanding as a 3k. Perhaps a stronger player may review differently, but I have merely commented according to my understanding of the game.

Sometimes some of my comments may seem harsh. I apologize if I occasionally come accross as very harsh. This is just my style of reviewing, and no disrespect is intended.

I have commented in detail on the subtleties of most moves, where the move was not obvious, and I have offered variations where appropriate.

I have also given a detailed summary of key concepts that you need to focus on at the end of the game.

Regards
Mark

I actually haven't played that many games - not more than 25. That was the first time I tried the Chinese Fuseki, but my opponent finally managed to totally destroy my moyo.

[Saurus\] I often play Chinese fuseki myself. I'll try to outline its aims over the next few moves and where you could have used it more effectively.]
;W[dj]LB[dg:A][qf:B]C[[Saurus\] I don't like this for white.

One of black's primary aims after playing the 3-4 stone is to extend along the left side and make a double-wing formation.

If black plays the super strong sente extension at d12 next, he has almost turned his corner moyo into territory with a single stone. It is normal in the Chinese fuseki for white to play a little closer to the c16 stone to avoid this extension.

The move at A (d13) is typical for white in this type of position. It prevents black from extending along the side, and effectively limits the power of his corner shimari. It is also flexible (or light), meaning that you can easily run, live or sacrifice the stone as you wish as the game proceeds.

w-c14 or w-d14 would be too close because if black answers with b-e16, then white is very close to thickness, and will run in to problems.

Another option would be to approach the q16 stone at B (r14) now, but then it is extremely important to choose a seki which ends in white sente so that you can come back to the left side first.]
(;B[pj]LB[dh:A][qn:B]C[<Black>
Better at R6?

[Saurus\] Given a choice of q10 vs r6, I would have played r6. However, since black is a move ahead, q10 is probably OK, although it does feel a little passive.

More importantly, I think d12 (A) is much bigger, and I definitely would have played it first. However, if you're sure of keeping sente, r6 (B) is also fine, and then come back to d12.

[SEE VARIATIONS\]]
(;W[jp]LB[nc:A][ql:B]C[[Saurus\] The problem with this type of move is that it is very similar to black's play, but black is always one move ahead.

While black can afford to play this way, white must be more aggressive, or black's moyo will become too hard to invade effectively, since he will close up his moyo or get a move around tengen first.

As white, you should not let your opponent get what he wants. Let's have a look at black's goals, and how you can make it difficult for him...
-Goal 1 for black: Black has a double-wing formation top right. A move at b-o16 would make it extremely hard to invade.
-Goal 2 for black: Expand his moyo in sente with a move like b-r6.

So what should white do?

Active choice - prevent black goal 1: Black has a weakness in that j17 is one space too far from o17, which means that if white invades at o17, white can make an ideal two space extension at L17 and live easily.

[SEE VARIATIONS\]

Passive choice - prevent black goal 2: White could play at r8 (B). Since q10 is high, a low white stone at B would be very effective at reducing black's moyo later, since it strongly supports an invading stone at w-q12, giving q12 miai of running to the center or connecting to r8.]
;B[qn]C[[Saurus\] Good!]
(;W[np]C[<White>
I feel O4 was my first weak move, too concentrated at this point. What do you think?

[Saurus\] Not at all! W-o4 was absolutely essential. It would have been catastrophic if you had played elsewhere. Have a look at what would have happened if you had omitted the move.

[SEE VARIATION\]];B[dp]C[<Black>
I felt I had a good opportunity to erase his moyo because of his 3-3 shimari, but I was afraid he would be able to contain me because of the two hoshi stones on the sides.

<White>
I had a similar impression: my stones on the side would help me reduce his D4 attack to a development opportunity.

[Saurus\] I like d4. At this stage I would rather be black than white.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[bo];B[dm];W[cl]C[[Saurus\] Interesting move. It looks strange at first, but is actually quite effective.]
(;B[cm]C[[Saurus\] This move is horrible. Remember that when you are in your opponent's territory, spreading out and making a path to the center is always a priority. Moves towards the edge should only be played if there is a clear and definite (and useful) cut.

This move does nothing except allowing white to connect, thus strengthening his position.

Remember the proverb which applies to playing inside your opponent's sphere of influence:
"When in opponent's sphere of influence, play fast and light!"

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[bm];B[hp]C[[Saurus\] Good.];W[iq]LB[nc:A]
C[<White>
Could this J3 be my first serious mistake? This was certainly not the better way to put pressure on his attacking group. Was G7 a better possibility? Or G2?

[Saurus\] Yes, this move was dreadful. It's pretty much a pass move. Black is alive. Black has no chance of making territory on the bottom, so it doesn't destroy territory. It enlarges your moyo by one point in gote (well, not even that, since black can stil play m4.)

So how to choose a move in a situation like this...

There is, in fact, an established order of priority as to which move is most important:

1) Play a move that affects the base of both your own and your opponent's groups, if it exists.
2) If you have a weakness, fix it.
3) If your opponent has a weakness, attack it.
4) If there are no weaknesses, play on the moyo frontier, on the border of your moyo and your opponent's moyo.
5) If there is no moyo frontier, play a big move on the side.

Let's consider...

1) No such move at the moment.
2) You have no real weaknesses, since black generously gave you w-b7 for free.
3) Yes, your opponent does have a weakness in his moyo - J-17 is a little too far from Q16 (as discussed previously). 

Therefore, the correct move now would have been a tenuki at O17 (A), thus exploiting the weakness in black's position.]
(;B[eq]LB[jo:B][nd:A]C[[Saurus\] What are you hoping to achieve with this move?

Certainly not trying, or even worse, wanting to live on the bottom? It's not a cut, since white is alive on both sides of e3.
Basically, it's a pass move.

As in the previous comment, a tenuki is appropriate now, since all groups are stable.

A move at o16 (A) makes it VERY difficult for white to effectively invade the top right. It would certainly be my move of choice.

However, locally, if you were still uncomfortable with the bottom left group, remember that contact moves that increase eyespace or give a better escape to the center are appropriate for defense. They are sente, and allow you to strengthen your position (although it strengthens your opponent too, but that's not important when your objective is defense and not attack.

Something like b-k5 (B) would have been good here. See variations for some local possibilities.

[SEE VARIATIONS\]]
(;W[cp]C[[Saurus\] This moves shows that you are afraid of our opponent. You need to PRACTICE READING to avoid this kind of move. Do life and death problems! I'm sure you have heard this a hundred times, but it is so true, so that you don't play moves like these. 

Tenuki was still the best move.

What damage can black do?

[SEE VARIATION\]];B[gm]LB[jo:B]C[<Black>
I really would appreciate some insight about this G7: was it reasonable? The shape looks weird.

<White>
Well, at the time, I felt black was getting the better of it.

[Saurus\] Aah, yes. G7 is a bit weird. I answered this question two moves back (move 21) without even seeing your question here. :)   Go back to that comment and variations to see why b-k5 (B) is better.

G7 just feels a litte cramped. You need to play fast and light, and expand rapidly when in opponent's territory.]
;W[cg]LB[nc:A]C[[Saurus\] Very nice move - one of the two most important moves on the board. (Of course, the other is (A), as already discussed.)]
;B[ed]C[[Saurus\] Very nice. With the near placement of j17, this translates into territory in the corner. This is a good result from your Chinese opening.]
;W[qf]LB[nc:A]C[[Saurus\] Wrong side!

ALWAYS choose the side with more space (A)!!!!!]
(;B[of]C[<Black>
I wanted him to go in the corner, and then to lean on the bottom and left groups to build a moyo.

<White>
I had no intention of letting black use that trick! I was thinking of extending down the side or fleeing toward the center. This P14 made me choose the first option.

[Saurus\] B-p14 is interesting. I can't find anything wrong with it, but my gut feeling tells me it gives white too much freedom to choose.

There is in fact a standard sequence for this exact corner position which is discussed in great detail in the first game in Kageyama's book "Kages secret chronicles of handicap Go."

[SEE VARIATION\]

Still, p14 is also pretty effective.]
(;W[qi]C[[Saurus\] I still would have chosen the corner. It's safe and once you have established a base, black's two side stones start to feel a bit lonely.

[SEE VARIATION\]]
(;B[qj]C[[Saurus\] Forcing moves that make territory first!

 Always look for forcing moves that make territory in sente.

Secure the corner first in sente, then block on the other side!

[SEE VARIATION\]]
(;W[qh]C[[Saurus\] I would definitely have chosen the corner now. Having already played r11, why not get the best of both worlds?

(Oh dear, for a second, I imagined that I sounded like a Hannah Montana song.)

[SEE VARIATION\]];B[qd]C[<Black>
That seems inconsistent I suppose, but I told myself that if he wanted to flee in the center, I would chase him to the bottom and build my moyo on top.

<White>
I knew that black could build something huge by pursuing me, so I wanted to make sure to invade the upper right rapidly, as soon as I felt my group was a bit secure.

[Saurus\] No, this is very good now. I would have played the same move.]
;W[oh]
(;B[nh]C[[Saurus\] Nooooooooooooooo!!!!!

DON'T USE CONTACT MOVES FOR ATTACKING!!!!!!

I'm sure you've heard this a million times. Why do you still do it?   :-(

Always attack with non-contact knight's moves.

The theory says so. The proverbs say so.

Memorize it. Repeat it over and over when you sleep at night rather than counting sheep.

Always attack with non-contact knight's moves.

Always attack with NON-CONTACT knight's moves.

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[oi];B[ng];W[kc]C[<White>
There is the invasion: I felt I could either escape or build a base on the side for my group of five stones on the right, so the time was good to invade before black made a defensive move.

<Black>
And there we go. This stone managed to totally erase my moyo potential. What was the proper response?

[Saurus\] I think white had no choice. This invasion was a must.

I think black's response was fine. See next move for further comments on black's response.]
(;B[mc]C[[Saurus\] This was fine.

Your previous comment suggests that you are confusing moyo with territory. Moyo means: "I will make territory from chasing white when he invades."  Territory means white cannot live if he invades.

After this invasion and the next few moves, black is firmly ahead on territory. This is good for black.

Another way of playing was to push white against your thickness as in the variation , but your way was also just as good.

[SEE VARIATION\]]
(;W[ke]C[[Saurus\] Problem is, with black's wall to the right of L15, you will have to run while black makes massive profit to the left.

You cannot afford to be on the run here. Rather play for influence as shown in the variation.

[SEE VARIATION\]];B[ie];W[kg]
(;B[nk]C[[Saurus\] I prefer the attack from the other side, preventing white from escaping to the center.

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[re]C[<Black>
White is contained, tries to live inside. I didn't want to stop him, I wanted to build my influence to properly attack the fleeing stones. I guess they were already too advanced inside my zone of influence for me to properly kill them.

[Saurus\] Good strategy. There is no need to kill. Your opponent living small is ALWAYS a good result!]
;B[rd];W[rj];B[rk];W[si];B[ni]LB[ig:A]C[<White>
I have the impression black would have been better off continuing his pursuit of my stones stretching on the L line. Now, he gave me a chance to secure my escape.

[Saurus\] Agreed!

O11 seems rather pointless, since the white group is already alive. There is no theat of white cutting, since black's groups are alive on both sides of the cut, so a "cut" by white would be as good as a pass.

Black should have played at j13 (A).];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[rb]
;W[ji]LB[ki:A][jh:B]C[[Saurus\]  Ooh, this is not good. Remember that a knight's move can always be cut.

Always run with a solid extension (B) or a one-space jump (A).

K11 leaves bad aji.]
(;B[jf]LB[ig:A]C[[Saurus\] This is absolutely dreadful. See the next white move for a tewari analysis to show why this move is bad...

Also, my comments on the next move show why j13 (A) was much better.]
;W[kf]C[[Saurus\] A tewari analysis (reversing the order of the moves) shows just how bad k14 really was...

If white had played L14 first, would you have played k14? Certainly not, but we end up in the exact same position. Thus, k14 cannot be good.

Right now, it seems that b-j13 was much better for black, no?]
;B[jg];W[kh];B[jh];W[kj]C[[Saurus\] See, it took an extra move to defend the knight's move cut. One move wasted where you can least afford to do so.]
;B[li]C[<Black> Trying to give him bad shape.];W[ki];B[hi]C[[Saurus\] Where do you want to make territory from attacking?

H11 is fine, but then you need to follow up with b-e13. Attack to make territory. Don't just attack for the sake of attacking.]
;W[kl]
(;B[lo]C[<Black>
I think I should have played this earlier, before giving chase to the fleeing group.

<White>
On the contrary, I felt this move by black was timed perfectly. I had just engaged my fleeing stones in that direction; their passage toward the left was getting difficult. With M5, black was putting my important lower right moyo under great danger, AND making me nervous as to the safety of my fleeing stones on the L line. A great play, at least for weak players such as ourselves...

[Saurus\] B-e13 now! E13 makes h11 count and puts black about 20 points ahead. Never assume that you will kill a dragon. Make TERRITORY from chasing it.

Besides, after b-e13, white will run at w-L6, and black will have sente again. This is really good for black.

With this thought-process in mind, what does m5 hope to acheive? Sure, it attacks the white dragon, but what does it profit from doing so?

Remember: Attack to make territory!

[SEE VARIATION\]];W[nm]C[<White>
I was happy with this solution, feeling that I had answered a good move with another good move. O7 served three purposes: (1) create the possibility of a link; (2) put pressure on M5; (3) undermine black's territorial possibilities between O9-R6-etc.

[Saurus\] Indeed, w-o7 is a lovely move!];B[jo];W[io]C[<Black>
And the fighting begins.

<White>
Another move I was quite happy of, since it served three purposes: (1) another possibility to connect with L8; (2) pressure on the black invading stones; (3) new menace on the black group on the left.

[Saurus\] :-D];B[jn];W[in];B[im];W[jm]C[<White>
I was starting to feel like a better player than I really am ;oP]
(;B[km]C[[Saurus\] This move turned out OK. However, it is theoretically unsound.

Firstly, remember the proverb: "Safety first"?

If white manages to cennect everything, the black m5/k5 stones will die.

Rather play j4 first to make sure all is connected, and THEN attack further. Also, as there is then no risk for black, an attack will be much more likely to succeed.

Secondly, what profit are you hoping to get from attacking?

[SEE VARIATION FOR HOW POWERFUL PLAYING SAFETY MOVES CAN BE\]]
;W[jl];B[lm];W[lq]C[<White>
Black had managed to create good shape while under pressure. Now I had to defend my lower right moyo.]
;B[ml]C[<Black>: Felt I had to connect and prevent a linking up of white's stones -- I was happy he played M3. I still (foolishly) thought I could kill the L-Group.

[Saurus\] This move is only necessary because you neglected the safety move at j4.

However, much more importantly:

DO NOT ATTACK TO KILL!
ATTACK TO MAKE PROFIT!

Have you ever watched high dan players on KGS. You will see that so often, even when they can kill a group, they don't. This is because there are usually much points to be made from threatening to kill than actually killing.  Furthermore, killing is gote.

It is so important to make territory from attacking, rather than trying to kill. Changing your mindset in this way will push you up quite a few stones in strength.]
;W[il];B[hm];W[gk];B[ek]C[<Black>
Some blunders on my part to come in this exchange.];W[gj];B[gi]
;W[ej];B[fj]C[<Black>
Ouch I know, misread here -- on Dave Peck's!...

[Saurus\] Yes, but the next move was worse!];W[fk];B[fi]LB[qq:A]
C[[Saurus\] This move is just sick. One point in gote. Doesn't cut. Doesn't protect territory. Doesn't threaten anything. Isn't even sente.

Do not play reflex moves like this! Concentrate on looking around before each move. Just spend two second to look around. Playing reflex moves will seriously impede your progress.

Something like b-r3 now is enormous!];W[el];B[em]LB[qq:A][eg:B]
TR[dn][do][eo][en][fn][gn][hn][fo][go][ho][fp][gp]C[<Black> A slow and useless move: D8 or tenuki was better I think.

[Saurus\] E7 is actually OK, because it encloses territory. It's probably worth 12 points if you play b-j4. If white protects at w-j4, then you get to tenuki, which is worth even more.

Perhaps not the biggest move on the board (r3 and e13 look enormous), but still not bad.

Still, locally, j4 is a must for black, because if white gets it, it's sente for white, because black's f5 area suddenly looks really small to make two eyes in.]
(;W[qp]C[<White>
I think this is the first of my two serious blunders. Playing better on any of those could have changed the final result. I should have connected at J4 – expecting a defensive response by black –, THEN play R4. I would have had a foot in his territory while still protecting my lower right corner. What do you think?

[Saurus\] Agreed. W-j4 is HUGE for white now, and black must then try and make eyes around f5 quickly!

[SEE VARIATION\]];B[dl]C[[Saurus\] Why not just j4?];W[dk];B[bl]
;W[ck];B[bn];W[bk];B[am];W[er];B[fr];W[dr];B[ip]C[<White>
Black takes advantage of my previous mistake. This J4 must be worth 10 points, minimum?

Probably much more, because black still doesn't have much eye-space. You could probably reduce dramatically while black struggles to make eyes.]
;W[ko]C[<Black>
Not sure why he played there.

<White>
I was in a daze after black J4. And I was too busy in real life to think about good moves. This will show in my play for the next 20-30 moves: I am just trying to pass time without any more blunders.

[Saurus\] Yip, L5 is so grotesque, it could scare children into not sleeping at night.]
;B[kn];W[fg]C[[Saurus\] Good!];B[ge]C[<Black>
His stones are somewhat thin... Was G15 too defensive?

<White>
I did feel that black was giving away important real estate too easily. Good for my morale, but was still uninspired...

[Saurus\] No, you are 20 points ahead. It is a good time to play defensively.]
;W[kb]LB[dc:A]C[<Black>
Threatening two monkey jumps...

<White>
Typical of my style of play when I lack time and concentration. Lucky for me: it did turn out well, because I kept the sente even after black successfully contained my monkey jump on the left.

[Saurus\] To be honest, there isn't much bigger. However, since you are far behind, it's time to be extremely aggressive, or you will lose otherwise. I would have tried something like w-d17 (A).

Hard to say if you would live or not, but there is certainly a lot of aji, especially with c13 stone where it is.]
;B[mb];W[ha]
(;B[ib]C[[Saurus\] This is not standard, but it was safe in this position, since white can afford to get cut off from L18 here, giving him much aji. Black did well.

;W[je];B[jd];W[kd];B[hg]C[<Black>
Probably was too cautious. That's two times that I let him play freely on the bottom right corner.

<White>
I did have that impression at the time. Black was a roaring lion keeping clear of a white mouse (F13).

[Saurus\] I disagree. The cut at j14 looks ominous. Black is ahead, so too much caution, therefore, cannot be observed. 

I would have played the same move.];W[ro];B[rn];W[sk];B[rl]
;W[pl]C[<Black>
I felt he overplayed here.

<White>
This must be my second major mistake. A simple P7 would have kept the pressure and insure my link with the lower group. Instead, this keima was weak and ended up being cut. Another important loss of at least 7-8 points, for no gain whatsoever.

[Saurus\] Agreed.];B[on];W[nn];B[om];W[de];B[dd];W[me];B[ne]

<Black and white>
Thank you for taking the time to review the game, it is very much appreciated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[SAURUS\] I think there are key strategic areas that both of you need to work on, and I have summarized what I think each of your weaknesses are below.

FOR BLACK:

1) I feel that the most important hurdle you need to get over is attacking for no reason. You must always assume that you will not kill your opponent. Attack to make profit! Play each attacking move with an idea to follow it up with a territory-enclosing move. Even if you don't play the follow-up move immediately, it is still important to have a territory-making follow-up move planned for each move when when attacking.

2) Don't use contact moves when attacking! I'm sure you've heard this a hundred times before, and yet, you still do it. Why? Don't do it! Concentrate hard on not doing this. In fact, I think, in a way, this is linked to point (1).  A contact move is made thinking only of killing, whereas a non-contact knight's move is designed to make territory while attacking. Going back on my variations in this game should prove this point to you.

FOR WHITE:

1) Your main stumbling block is your being satisfied with living small. The group on the right lived small. The bottom left corner lived small. The dragon kept on running rather than making influence, and ended up making 3 or 4 points of territory - small again. Make sure you expand your space as much as possible before trying to live. (For example, you could have expanded into the corner in the top right, thus living much bigger. You could have played j16 instead of L15, thus expanding.) Your primary point of focus for the next while should be always to try and press outwards and EXPAND before living small.

2) As white, you must be more aggressive in fuseki, since black is always a move ahead. Your moves would have been fine had you been playing black, but not as white. With point (1) above in mind, O17 rather than r14 should have been your obvious choice of invasion point in the fuseki, since it gives your invading move more room to expand. Focus on spreading out as quickly and as much as possible in fuseki, especially as white.

FOR BOTH PLAYERS:

Practice reading! Do life and death problems. Do hundreds of them. Do thousands of them. If you don't have time, then do one a day, but don't miss a day without doing at least one. If you're serious about improving at Go, this is what you have to do.

Lastly, I think this was a wonderful game, and I feel you both played way above your level. I hope you find my comments useful, and that you enjoy the review.  :)
