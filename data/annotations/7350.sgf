C[Elsien [9k\]: hi, gg
Dave100 [10k\]: good evening];B[pp]C[J: Hi, I'm Jorik Mandemaker and I have reviewed this game as requested by white. I have prefixed all my comments with a J. Set your sgf viewer to show the variations so you can see my suggestions for other moves. If I use any terms you don't understand you can look them up at sensei's library on http://senseis.xmp.net]

(;W[eo];B[cf]C[Elsien [9k\]: I don't particularly like this pincer for W -- Thinking at the time "I like this big extention from my thickness" looking back on it I would have played somewhere else.]

(;W[ch]C[J: This pincer is a good move and it's the right way to use your thickness here. If you play F17 instead black will neutralize your thickness. See the variation for this move.]
;B[ef]
(;W[eh]C[J: This move is interesting. It builds a moyo for white at the bottom but lets the white 44 stone get sealed in. It's playable but very complicated.
I've suggested some other variations. See the variations for this and the next few moves.]

(;B[bd];W[cc];B[bc];W[fd]C[J: Good, you have to move out.];B[cd]
;W[dc];B[mc];W[jc];B[pg]
(;W[fg]C[J: There are two ways to attack this group. The move you played aims at sealing black in which is a good way to attack. 

The other way is to take black's eyespace and chase him out into the center. See the variation for that.

You can also play elsewhere first (O3 for example) and later decide how to attack black.]
;B[cb];W[db];B[ca];W[de]C[Elsien [9k\]: I think this was a misread at the time, because all this does is make B stronger for no reason at all.

J: Yes, it's best not to play this move.];B[df]
(;W[ff]C[Elsien [9k\]: Slow move accomplishing almost nothing, I should have played in a large area this move I think.

J: This is a very thick move. But you are right it is a bit slow. Mostly because the black upper right formation is quite solid. See the variations.

Also Black is already alive. Sealing in living groups is not as important as sealing in groups that don't have certain eyeshape yet.]
;B[pj]
(;W[iq]C[J: This is a very slow move. It's way to close to your thickness. You should play far away from your thickness. You have to play as far as O3 here.]
;B[mq];W[qn];B[ql]
(;W[rp]C[J: This is not good. You give up the 33 point invasion now. and it doesn't help your eyeshape much. I would just take the corner right away.]
;B[qq];W[on];B[gp];W[io]C[J: Good.];B[gn];W[im];B[gl];W[ik]
C[J: All good.];B[cj];W[dk]C[J: Again good. Split black.];B[fj]

;W[ai];B[hj]
(;W[hh]TR[eh][fd][ff][fg]C[J: This move doesn't use the marked wall very effectively. You are using thickness to make territory . You should use it to attack black.]
;B[ij];W[jk];B[ih]
(;W[ji]C[J: Way to agressive.];B[jj];W[kj];B[jh];W[ki];B[ii]

(;W[kk]C[J: Black is kind not to cut anywhere. But you can make a better connection here.]
;B[fh]
(;W[eg]C[J: You are connecting groups that are already alive. That's not very useful.]
;B[hg];W[gg];B[gh];W[ig]C[J: It looks like you are desperately trying to kill black. That's very hard to do. You should attack to make some profit. Killing is usually imposible.]
;B[hf];W[jg];B[kg];W[jf];B[kf];W[je];B[kh]TR[hc][id]C[J: See how you didn't gain anything from your attempt to kill? and black just easily escapes. In the meanwhile you are left with some weaknesses in your position at the top.]
;W[ke];B[mg];W[le]C[J: Black is already safe. Time to stop attacking him.]
;B[mf]
(;W[nj]TR[on][qn][rp]C[Elsien [9k\]: I Tried too hard to keep the black stones from connecting, and I paid for it. Now I have weak groups and B is able to fight anywhere, W simply gave black the UR and I think that was a result of spending moves to either fix bad moves or bad ideas that W had.
Elsien [9k\]: TY to whomever reviews this game :)

J: You only have one weak group. That's the one in the lower right (marked). The center group isn't weak at all. it's very strong. And it can even connect using G2.

But the upper right isn't solid black territory yet. it can easily be invaded.

The move you just played doesn't have a good connection to your weak group. I suggested P4 earlier. But Q8 is possible too.

The main problem with this game where the slow moves of F14 and especially J3. But even then you still had plenty of chances.

There are still more comments and variations later in the game.]
;B[ok];W[nk];B[nl];W[oj]C[J: This only provokes black into making himself stronger and thereby attacking your bottom right group.]
;B[pl]
(;W[oh]C[J: rather pointless. Your weak group needs help.

If you want to reduce the upper right you can easily live in the corner.]
