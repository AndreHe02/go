[as][bs][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Black wins by 17.5.

I think basicly  you lost this game was,
because you let your opponent easily take the corners
and the right side in the opening.  You missed the right moment to reduve blacks right side
and played some very small moves in the bottom instead.
After the error i move 56 B had an easy game. He missed
some good chances to increase his leading in the midgame
but still won comfortable.

You should study games of better players to see how
they play the joseki and get a balanced game.
I think it is a good practice for beginners to follow
the simple rule: first corners, then sides. It is difficult
to make many points in the center even if your mojo
looks big.])
