SQ[qj]C[wild : This move does not seem necessary as white corner is more or less secure already. Even if a move is to be made here, white can consider a bigger move to R10.]
;B[qn];W[cj];B[cn]SQ[fq]C[wild : Wrong direction. Should be played at F3 instead. Notice that black has no room for building a base.]
;W[cp];B[dn]SQ[en][fm]C[wild : Too slow. Should be played at E6. Could even be played looser still with F7. Underlying principle is that black should be prepared to abandon C6 when necessary.]
;W[gq]C[wild : Good attacking posture. Surrounding territory while attacking.]
;B[iq];W[fo]SQ[cn][dn]C[wild : Good. Strengthenting white corner and adding pressure on black's 2 stones.]
;B[ck];W[bj]SQ[dk]C[wild : weak response. A hane at D9 is better.]
;B[bk]
(;W[cg]SQ[cf]C[wild : See better alternative in variation. Also, even if this move is to be made, could have gone one further at  C14.]
;B[fc];W[kq];B[io];W[mq]SQ[ko]TR[nq]C[wild : Follow the jump to the center. Anyway, one point jump to the right is too small. could have gone at least 2 point jump at O3.]
;B[oq]C[wild : Good move. Secures the corner.]
(;W[nr]TR[bk][ck][cn][dn]SQ[io][iq]C[wild : Take a look at the situation now. Black has two unsettled groups marked squares and triangles. White could gain upper hand by dividing and attacking the two groups. See variation.]
;B[or];W[lo]SQ[ln]C[wild ; Could be bolder at M6.];B[qk]C[wild : That's ignoring the threats to both black groups. Dangerous.]

(;W[oi]C[wild. Should seize opportunity to attack. See variation.]

[dn]SQ[io][iq]C[wild ; All those few moves before have neglected the two unsettled black groups]
;B[im]SQ[be][ce][de][cg][bj][cj][dj]C[wild : Situation now : black has more territory but the two groups remains unsettled and could prove to be too much a burden later. All of white's groups are more or less settled and have no life and death issue to worry about. There is over concentration of white stones on the left side.]
;W[fm]C[wild : Good. Separate and attack.];B[el];W[gl];B[fk]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[bl];B[cl];W[bm];B[bn];W[ak];B[am];W[aj];B[cm]
;W[al];B[em]C[wild : Good. Rduce black group's eye space to only one eye. This mean that the group still need to struglle to get another eye or connect back to other groups.]
;W[fn]C[wild ; Slow. No danger there at all.];B[gk];W[hl];B[kn]
;W[ko]SQ[ln][mm]C[wild: Wrong direction. Should be M6 or N7.]

;B[kk];W[kj];B[lk];W[pd];B[oc]C[wild : White ought to have continued its attack.]
;W[nf]C[Wild : White does not have enough territory to continue this "You take yours, I take mine" strategy.]

;B[eo];W[rm];B[qm];W[rp];B[rq];W[qq];B[qp];W[sq];B[rr];C[wild : The rest of what transpired was mostly "I surround what I can and you surround what you can". Like I mentioned earlier, black already has more territory than white. So that strategy will almost certainly result in a loss for white.

To improve, white can consider being bolder and bigger in your moves, like those pointed out earlier.

I hope you found this commentary useful.])

[mq]MA[lr][lo][lp]C[wild : Black is only making escape moves. No territory gained and the group still lacks eye space. On the other hand white group is more secure now as it has both eye space and room to move out to the center and maybe connect back to the top right.]
