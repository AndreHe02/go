I think you should stabilize K16 while attacking w's thin shape, before playing another stone this far away from K16.]

--

A sequence starting with O18 is now sente.

After that, R10, R14 or anything similar on the right side is fine, and B12 is also big.]
;B[jj];W[qn];B[op]C[is q5 maybe better for black?

--

Not necessarily.  Q5 leaves more chance for an invasion, while this is more secure.  Q5 can also help w settle his group.]

Yes, now many of b's stones in the center become very useful.]

It was a fairly short game and there didn't seem to be much for me to point out but I hope the review is helpful.
