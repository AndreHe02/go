C[Shashka: Hi, thanks for reviewing the game. Although I (white) eventually won, I certainly don't feel I deserved to. I'd appreciate tips on what went wrong, and where I can best focus on improving.

pajaro: Hi. I'll try to help you see what went wrong. I'll start my comments with pajaro. Enjoy!]
;B[dp];W[pd]C[Shashka [9k?\]: Hello :)
cure [10k\]: hello
cure [10k\]: hello

pajaro: You'd better say hello only once ;)];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo]
;W[jp]C[Shashka: I think now this should have been one line lower; the black extension seems too tight on white now.

Pajaro: Maybe. But I think that so early in the game, this is a matter of style. It depends on what you want to do later.]

(;B[lp]C[pajaro: This is wrong. First, white can extend at any time in both directions, so there is no hurry to play this. Second, you should extend from your weaker side and press towards the strong one. The shimari is stronger, so black is a little overconcentrated. If you press this way, it will go like in the game: black loses sente. In the other direction, see var.]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[qk]C[Shashka: This is also for too close to thickness, right? I was hoping to create a weak group above and chase it out to link up my bottom group.

pajaro: You are expecting (actually, needing) a black mistake. No good. And yes, it's a little too close to thicknes. If black invades, white will have to defend. It won't be easy to attack the invading atones.]
;B[qi];W[qg]C[pajaro: Again, you are extending from strength toward thinnes.]

(;B[pi]C[pajaro: This may be heavy, but the result is bad for white. The R9 white stone is weak, between two stronger black positions. BTW, see var.]
;W[ok]C[pajaro: Now you can see why Q11 was heavy. White is one step forward.]
;B[ni];W[pn];B[rm];W[mk];B[li];W[np];B[ln];W[jn];B[kl]C[pajaro: Both players must be careful. They could cut or be cut.]
;W[km];B[lm];W[ll]C[pajaro: Hard fight.];B[ko];W[mo]
(;B[kn]C[pajaro: Bad. It helps white. See var.];W[jm];B[jo]
;W[jk]C[pajaro: I'm not sure. I think white can J5 and fight.]
;B[ip];W[lj];B[fc];W[cf]C[Shashka: pincer here? I considered it, but thought the F17 aji would give the top group enough to escape too easily.

pajaro: A pincer might help you to develop the upper side, but it would be difficult because of the M11 chain. Maybe this is ok.]
;B[ic];W[jd]C[pajaro: Are you attacking? Remember: don't touch what you attack. This will help black.]
;B[kj];W[kk];B[mj]C[pajaro: Perhaps I would play O10.]
(;W[lk];B[nc];W[nd]C[Shashka: I chose the attachment joseki to strengthen the corner and help cut off the center.]
;B[md];W[ne];B[oc];W[pc];B[jc]C[pajaro: This is why K16 was bad. Black is stronger and has more territory.]
;W[mc]C[pajaro: This doesn't work.]
(;B[mb]C[pajaro: See previous var.];W[lc];B[ld];W[le];B[kd]
;W[ke];B[me];W[mf];B[kc];W[mh]C[Shashka: was thinking of the L11 cut, but white above is weak - perhaps K14 instead? This kikashi didn't serve as much purpose as I'd thought.

pajaro: Actually, I think you jelp black. White can't cut at P11 after this.]
;B[mi];W[ji];B[lh];W[mg];B[jh];W[kg];B[kh];W[cj];B[cl];W[ej]
;B[ii];W[gm]C[pajaro: I think this is a mistake. Black is not alive yet, but K10 would give an eye and life, because an eye in S11 is easy. On the other hand, this does not save F4.]
;B[jf];W[je];B[lf];W[lg];B[kf];W[jg];B[if]C[pajaro: This is risky for black. Captures four stones, but make white stronger.]
;W[ig];B[hg]
(;W[hf]C[pajaro: white lost a chance. See var.];B[ie];W[hh]
;B[gg];W[ih];B[hi];W[jj]C[Shashka: In retrospect, I think J10 would have been better.

pajaro: This is ok. Leads to the same result than my var, but here Black could have given up his J14 group to save the center.]

;W[fe]
(;B[pg]
(;W[pf]C[pajaro:  A mistake? All vars that I try are bad for white.]
;B[qf]
(;W[ph]C[Shashka: I decided against the variation because of the eye (see var.) - but on second, deeper inspection, black only has (a ko for?) one eye and not much chance of a second.

pajaro: See black s13.]

;B[ra];W[re]

;W[nh];B[pa];W[sd];B[sf];W[qa];B[qb];W[rb];B[sb];W[qa];B[rj]
;W[rk];B[qb]C[Shashka: Big mistake starting a ko fight and not having proper threats to play with. The large group in the upper right was effectively dead by my reckoning, but even so I made the mistake of thinking that black's G12 group was eyeless - I just didn't notice that the J13 etc. stones weren't dead. Fortunately this paid off, but I was on course for a serious loss.

pajaro: Black made mistakes. But you can't expect that.];W[jq]

pajaro: At this point, Black still has enough liberties. Black needs 5 moves. Black has more than 5 libs, and can still get some more and an eye.]

Pajaro: Well, despite of the black mistake, only a 7.5 pt win. Not a deserved win... But still, two advices:
- Always have an eye on safety. That one side fails to attack (or even kill) doesn't mean that you have a strong position.
- Extend from thinnes toward thickness. In this way, your thin group will be stronger, and you enemy group will face strong postions in bothe sides.]
