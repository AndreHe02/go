C[Hello !

Thanks for reviewing my game.

I played this game as white (my current rank is 13 kyu) on IGS. My opponent rating was 14+kyu

Eventhough I finally won the game by a large amount, the score doesn't reflect the game. I was actually rather lagging behind before my opponent seriously blundered.

I expect from this review to understand the mistakes I did in the fuseki and middle game, as I really need to improve my strategy reasoning in these phases.

Cheers,

;W[np];B[cf]C[Naively, I expected my opponent to answer according to the joseki at Q6. From black's point of view, is this correct to tenuki here ? If not, how do I punish black ?

Ben: Honestly I don't know how to "punish" B here either.  But I give some possible variations.  One thing to do might be to try this yourself against a stronger opponent and see what they do.

Another option, when you don't know what to do is to simply continue the joseki as if B had responded as you expected (i.e., with a move around k4), the best B can do is play at q6 in that case, then you would have the advantage of sente.]
(;W[fc]C[I couldn't imagine not answering to black's approach. However I was worried that my two stones at O3 were lacking a base. What is the priority here ?

Ben: Of course the whole point of a tenuki is that he gets an advantage in one sector of the board with his power decreasing in the area he played away from.

So there is no priority to play in either area, just shifting balances of power.  Use tenuki to put your opponent off balance, and to turn a boring position into an interesting one.]
;B[bq];W[cp]C[Ben: This move is appropriate.];B[jq]C[This is basically what I was afraid of.

Ben: Nothing to be afraid of.  B should play q6 before considering moves like this.]
;W[hq]C[Ben: This is fine.];B[fq]C[Was H3 too careless ?];W[gp]
C[Here I decided to push black to left, toward my "strong" stones. But actually, how strong are they ?

Ben: Lets look.  In general these moves (by you) seem acceptable to me.]

Keep your groups connected by keeping the marked stones dead.  That's how you stay "thick".]
;B[dr];W[eq];B[er]C[Ben: B getting connected  complicates things.]
(;W[cq];B[cr];W[ep]SQ[go][gn][dj][cf]C[Ben: Obviously the situation has become less than ideal, however W does not need to roll-over just yet, rather than this move why not around d8?  True the marked move makes  two eyes for your group and therefore unconditionally alive but that is only one thing.  Other moves here could serve a similar purpose but set up a potentional attack against the marked black stones.]
;B[gr];W[po]C[My aim here was to take advantage that black didn't play Q6 earlier.

Ben: This seems fine but h2 seems like alternative, I can't say which approach is better.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[op];W[oo];B[ro]C[I guess a cut at O5 would hurt ....

Ben: If your afraid of the cut you could have played p5 instead of r5.

It would be double edged for B though, these box-shapes in the corner can be tricky, you might have played s3 and r2 or q2 and it may become tricky for him to live later in the game.]
;W[mn];B[hr];W[jo]C[Ben: B has been very generous to you, letting you connect your groups.]
;B[rn]C[Ben: Very small move at this stage.];W[dh]C[Here I decided to invade black's stones.
I have a question of judgement: can the white group at the bottom be considered as strong and thick ? Without the 2 black stones at G5/6 I would say so, but in this case I am not sure. Anyway I invaded because I though I was strong enough at the bottom.

Ben: In my estimation W is doing much better on the bottom, especially after Bs recent plays.  This is an appropriate strategy for W.]
;B[gl];W[nc]C[Maybe I should have continue with my invasion instead of approaching black here ?

Ben: This is a big point as well, don't be afraid to "tenuki".]
;B[oc]C[Ben: By the way, never play this kick unless you already have a stone around q14 or say l17, he is just making you stronger, and it doesn't make the corner any more secure.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jd];B[ef]C[Ben: Backing up what I said earlier you may play in the following way: see variation.]
(;W[fh];B[gf];W[hg]C[Ben: I probably wouldn't even bother "leaning" on these stones.  Just h12 is good enough (and more solid, can't be cut) and go ahead and let him run away with this group that isn't worth hardly any points for him while you build up power.]
;B[hd]C[I felt that trying to attack black I was now actually the one under attack ...

Ben: If there is one lesson you should take away, you can't attack from weakness, you have many more stones in this area of the board, you have two fairly sold bases on the top, and your other stones have lots of room to run, his stones can be cut and in the end you should come away with something.]
;W[hf];B[gg]MA[ge]C[Ben: How about g15 now?]
(;W[gh];B[he]
(;W[hh]SQ[hg][hf]C[Again a cut at H12 would hurt ...

Ben: Would it? Im not sure you need to worry overmuch about this cut at the moment.  Ask first; is he getting any real territory here, even if he wins the marked  stones it amounts to 4 points, there are many places on the board that are bigger.   What about this cut on g15?

Actually I wouldn't cut on g15 and I will give a variation why but the cut on h12 isn't that great either.  If you played at k14 for instance and allow him to cut you then in the ensuing fight he will damage his stones around g8/6/5 and d10.

In short don't fear cuts, try to visualize what will happen after the cut and if it lacks teeth don't bother preventing it.]

;B[id];W[ic];B[je];W[kd];B[bh];W[ci];B[cj];W[bi]C[I think it's fair to say here that my invasion wasn't a success: black is strong and I am not.

By keeping black disconnected, all my hope relied on attacking and killing the black group. I didn't succeded, hence I should have lost the game.

Ben: I wouldn't throw in the towel just yet.  Significant questions remain about the loose grouping around g8..]

I woudn't mind if you stop the review here and focus more on what happened until here. I would like to improve my reasoning to avoid ending in situation like that in the future.

Thanks again !
Maxime

Ben: Seems like you have a pretty good feel for what ought to be played but falter when it comes to plays that are novel.  I would suggest experimenting with tenuki plays yourself.  After that try some more unconvential approaches.  In the opening don't get fooled into following your opponent around the board, take your time and look for the biggest move even if he seems to be most concerned about plays that take 1 point of territory (e.g., s6).  It looks like your doing this already but it doesn't hurt to emphasize it, and since you are doing this already make sure to be confident about your approach.  Everybody has a bad game once in awhile it won't do to give up on solid pragmatic play.]
