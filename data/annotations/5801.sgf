;B[ro]C[not wrong, but small-scale thinking; if it was good for black to play K4 it is also good to play K16]
;W[on];B[np];W[oq];B[pq]C[if S5 were not there, would you have played here?  what difference does S5 make?]
;W[op];B[oo]C[i would have played Q5 instead];W[po];B[no];W[nq]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[mq];W[rn];B[nr]C[this is a mistake i think... must i play R4 instead? or S3?

rag: all the last 6 moves or so were mistakes. but this move is a good one. giving up a small capture of R5S5 for total thickness and profit on lower side in sente is a big advantage for black]
;W[qp];B[rp]C[it doesnt take years of experience to read forced sequences a couple of moves ahead.  white's next move is to atari and the he can turn to capture 3 stones instead of 2, had you played R3.]
;W[qq];B[or];W[rq]C[white gets 3 stones in gote.  white gives you sente for nothing. you should say "thanks, white!"]
;B[qr]C[toooooooooo slowwwwwwwww];W[rr]C[ditto];B[cj]C[good]
;W[nc]C[good];B[cc]C[is play for territory good in this position? maybe better to play somewhere else?

rag: its not bad.  however, i would have played on the right side]

;W[bc]C[white's choice of joseki has given you  a huge lead and sente]
;B[df]C[slow];W[ef];B[eg];W[fg]C[good];B[ff]C[is this a mistake?
rag: no];W[ee];B[fh];W[gg];B[dh];W[gh]C[good];B[cn]C[ok];W[fi]
C[slow];B[eh];W[gj];B[jm]C[not bad, but your bottom side is open at D3 and white's last few moves have built massive influence for him along the top side, so your earlier lead has been substantially reduced.  white's right side is still open.]
;W[jd]C[good.  its hard to see a good place for black to invade the top.]
;B[qf]C[how is better to invade the right side of the board? is this move good or bad?

rag: one move by itself is rarely good or bad - its the thinking behind it.  you can expect to come under pressure while white builds something on right side and secures top right at the same time.  i would have played around R12 instead so i could extend either way.]
;W[qh]C[good];B[of];W[oh]C[good];B[qd];W[qc];B[rc]C[as white, i would now play as shown in the variation.]

(;W[rd];B[qe];W[rb];B[pc];W[qb];B[od];W[pb];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd]
;W[mc];B[md];W[lc];B[mf];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[dr];W[fq];B[cq]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[gp]C[i would have played more lightly, maybe at K2 or G7]

;B[el]C[this stone leaves gaps at D9 and D7.  if you wanted to kill and were completely sure you could, G8 might be better.  but Go is not about killing.  it is about making territory or influence while threatening to kill.]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[in];B[io]C[empty triangles almost always inefficient]
;W[gn];B[ho];W[go];B[hn];W[gm];B[im]C[slow];W[dk]C[i wonder if white has read this through? he doesnt have 2 eyes or a sure way out for his G7 group yet.]
;B[dl];W[gl]C[good];B[ek];W[mh]C[now i'm already far behind i think... what is the best move now? is there a chance to win?

rag: "far behind i think".  why not make a rough count instead of guessing? 
lets try:
white: top - about 57
          right - about 36
          total - about 93
black: left - about 39
          top right - about 6
          bottom right - about 30
          total - about 75

so white is nicely ahead if he gets the whole upper side and all the right side. but  in a kyu game (i am a kyu too) a middle game lead of 18 points is not decisive.  especially here, as your points are just about certain, whereas his are potential.

but how did this come about?  you were miles ahead about 30 moves back.

maybe it started with your invasion at C3.  but no, you came out of that with sente....aha! you didnt use your sente properly! you didnt invade the top or right but instead played some verrrry slowwww moves, allowing white to build his influence E14..G13.  

when you did come in at R14 you were lucky to live so easily but played another slow move at J7 when you had sente and could have invaded before white had a chance to expand.

mind you, white's right side is not sure territory, even if J7 blocks one line of escape, you still have the K7-O6 line to aim for as a rescue area.

so, in sum, i would say no, you are not far behind.  i would think about invading right side at say R10 which can either link to R14 or jump lightly to O9 depending on white's response.  bits will be cut off here and there but whites right side will be reduced from its current potential.]
;B[kf]C[too slow.];W[mm]C[nice move.];B[nn]C[too slow];W[nm]
;B[kk];W[ln]C[as white, i would block around N10 first];B[lo]
;W[kn];B[jn];W[ko];B[kp];W[mj];B[ie]C[this is a mistake too. how can i invade top side?

rag: wrong question :) you should instead ask yourself "how could i have prevented making it necessary to invade so late?" and learning from that so next time you wont be forced into desperate measures.

i dont think you can invade it; or rather, i dont see how i could if i were black.]
