Hello, I am Bernd, HonFu in the GTL. I am going to review your game.]

f5 for take sente and make instant life

Hon: C3 is correct.];W[eq];B[er];W[fp]
(;B[gq]C[Hon: This is not joseki.

Black only helps white getting more thickness.];W[gp]C[i think now is good moment for h4, i miss t=
hat now];B[cp];W[co];B[hp]C[Hon: This is not a very good move. Black creates a weak group for no reason.]
;W[hr]C[Hon: White goes down here and gives black bad shape. Bad is fighting too hard.]
;B[gr];W[gs];B[fr]C[Hon: Allowing shapes like these normally are only acceptable if you get quite a compensation.]

;W[no];B[kn];W[nm];B[pm]C[even if k4 group is weak, i think black is ok and prepa=
re an atack for top left corner or left side

Hon: I can not agree with that judgement.

Black has a weak group now, and that is very bad. Even if black "attacks" the upper left corner (approaches the corner!), it will be no good, if the black group in the center dies.]
(;W[pl];B[ql];W[qk]C[Hon: Although white could simply attack and get an easy advantage, he helps black starting a mess.]
;B[ol];W[pk]
(;B[qm];W[om];B[nl];W[mm];B[oj];W[pi];B[ni]
(;W[ml]C[Hon: The lower side group has no problems. White is playing from the strong group, which is a mistake. We have to play, where the weak stones are!]
;B[qg]C[Hon: Suddenly the roles of attacker and defender switch.]
;W[pg];B[qh];W[qi];B[mk];W[ph];B[qf]
(;W[lk];B[ng]C[Hon: Black stays cool and takes the key point of attack and defence.]
;W[pf];B[pe];W[nf];B[mg];W[oe];B[nc]C[Hon: Black wants more points. He wants to have it all - live with two weak groups in the center and possess every corner anyway.]
;W[md];B[mc];W[ld];B[hl]
(;W[mj]C[Hon: White loses sight of what is important.]
(;B[nj];W[nk];B[ok];W[kg]C[Hon: Now white got a key point.]
;B[mf];W[nd];B[kf];W[lc];B[od]
(;W[lg]C[Hon: Not good.];B[lf];W[id];B[jg]C[Hon: Now white's two stones are weak, and black has an easier time than he should have.]
(;W[li];B[jh];W[ki];B[je];W[ij]C[now black seems ok in center with both group, but i'm afraid white =
to take top and left side (instead cut at J 10- > D 10)

Hon: Although so far white did not achieve as much as he could have, black's judgement is totally off. Black has two weak groups in the center, which have just been separated.

It is only natural that white will get the upper and left side now, and it would also be not out of the question if at least one of the groups dies]
;B[gn]
(;W[fo]C[Hon: Again the I-need-every-stone-disease.

I have added some ideas. I don't know which is best, but it is important to attack the groups as a whole!]
;B[fm]
(;W[im]C[Hon: Don't hack into the eyespace like this, when the group is not even close to getting surrounded.]

6, j5 sente

i choose to make separate life for extend my group to the edge (left and to=
p)

Hon: Since white allows this so readily, it will probably work.]
;B[hh];W[ih];B[ig];W[ii];B[jd];W[jc];B[ic];W[kb];B[hd]C[Hon: This result is ridiculous. White has no idea how to attack a group. He must have felt very frustrated.]

(;W[dl]C[Hon: Always those small scale moves!];B[dj];W[el];B[em]

(;W[bi];B[ch];W[bh];B[fg]C[i want this enclosure, not for link (but is ok to link =
this group) but for a ko at m7, prepare n6 ko or cut at o6

;B[fd];W[ed];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb]C[Hon: Black is alive, and the game is close in a silly way.

This game was a confrontation of two players who each miss something very important. Black does not know how important a strong position is. He creates weak groups everywhere and calls it a good result. 

But black's reading skills and fighting experience makes up for that. At times he reads out sequences of which maybe his opponent has only dreamed.

White had the chance on his hand to hit black hard, because he had the superior strategical position all the time.

But he let it slip away, because he obviously had no idea how to attack an enemy weak group. 

Black destroyed almost all of whites potential, and white barely gets enough compensation for a roughly even game by capturing some stones.

Pointers for black - it is NOT a good result to have a weak group floating in the center - let alone two! You only won this game because white did not know how to attack you. In a normal, evenly match a weak group normally gives you a loss of 15 to 30 points. And you had two of them! 

Pointers for white: you have to look for moves that surround a weak group as a whole - single stones are not important, neither your own, not your opponent's. Often a cap is the move that is necessary.

Both players should run to the next go book store and add these books here to their personal go libraries.

You always have to watch the groups as a whole, not attack a single stone, or defend a single stone.
