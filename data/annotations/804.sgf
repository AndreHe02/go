GC[White had an easy fuseki but with 32 he made a mistake that 33 could turn into an upset for black, 35 was what could be called the losing move, but white had a killable group at the end.]

;B[ec]C[This is usually a bad move unless the white stone at F17 is
already pincered and you want to make it heavy to attack.];W[fd]
;B[df];W[jd]C[The white stone at F17 was not already pincered, so instead
of becaming heavy it became strong and white has a good
position at the top. C17 is still open to invasion.];B[ch]C[Right side is bigger, more urgent and a white move here will not put
in danger noone of the blacks groups.
M17 threatening K18 next would also be good.];W[nc]C[Good point, white stones look balanced, while black's are all but one
at the same side.];B[nd]C[I'm not sure this is the right joseki: strengthening white
will make the threat of black E18, that transforms the
corner in territory,  less dangerous.];W[md];B[ne]C[This is defnitely wrong, P17 instead, trying to make white
feel overconcentrated would be better.];W[oc];B[pc];W[qf]C[Because of K16, and because it's backed up by F16,17, white
can take sente and attack forcefully.];B[pe]C[R15 would be the normal answer, but after white Q14 b P16,
w Q10 would make miai of P4 or P6, setting up a nice
position for white or rescuing the 2 stones at O,P17.
So I suppose Q15 is good.];W[ph];B[op];W[pn];B[qq]C[Instead of reinforcing white at the corner that will make
an invasion at the right side more diffcult just playing L3
looks better.];W[rq];B[pq];W[ro];B[hq]C[Still L3 is the move, now white L or M 4 would left black
with 2 very weak groups.];W[mq];B[kq]C[Because of white mistake appears this faboulouse L3 that at
once stabilizise H3, thus weakening the 3 white stones at the
lower left,  and attacking N3 helps the black lower right stones.]
;W[mo];B[mr]C[This doesn't connect, P6 was the move. white can in fact
play now at O 12.];W[nr];B[nq];W[np];B[or];W[oq]C[Instead of going for the ko white also can play
atari and connection at M2,3. That leaves the 2
black stones at the left in a very weak position.];B[eq];W[lr]
;B[fq]C[I thought the ko threat was to cut now at E4 !];W[ep]
;B[gp];W[fn];B[hn];W[gm];B[em];W[hm];B[jn];W[oj];B[qk]C[Looks too deep an invasion, P8 would make the
combination of  O3 and then P6 more interesting.];W[pl];B[rh]

played G12.];B[gj];W[gh]C[Now is too late.];B[fg];W[gk];B[ij]

white.];W[cb];B[ec];W[gf]C[Looks sente, but will remove the aji of white playing  at D7, so ...]
;B[ej]C[That was not a ko threat !
Not only the white invasion it's a failure: now the white stones
emerging from the lower left are in big danger. We'll see them
at the end of the game.];W[dc];B[nq];W[ms];B[ec];W[da]C[And your first threat then must be extending at D19 and make
it a very big ko.];B[dc];W[gb];B[no];W[mp];B[ol];W[pk]C[Instead of Q9 I would play P7.]
;B[pm]C[P6 instead of Q7 looks better.];W[om];B[nn];W[oo];B[po]
C[Instead of Q5 the double atari of P6 is better.];W[on];B[qn]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[pp]C[Looks like you resigned here, but which is the status of
the lower left corner white group ?];B[jk];W[jl];B[kl];W[hk]
;B[ik]C[There's no way to get an eye at the center.
Let's see white possibilities in the corner:
Now, of course if white D7 threatened a double
atari at F8, so forced black E9, white could
then play at C7 and things would become a lot
more complicated for black.]
