C[Hi David, estimating your strength from this game is quite difficult actually, because the computer makes some very weak moves. My comments are marked with AB.]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[pp];W[dp];B[nc];W[iq]C[AB: Already the first weak move by White.]
;B[cm]C[AB: Your move is maybe not the very best but quite ok. You should not worry about it too much, because you don't win or lose because of this.

My ogeima approach here was not too well thought out. I figured making a rough double wing formation from the upper left corner was a decent idea, and I figured I was preventing a white extension along the left side as well.]
;W[jq]C[AB: Now this one is already ridiculous.];B[qf]C[AB: Yes, very good. Black is already clearly ahead.

Was this the right time to attack the upper right?];W[cj];B[fm]
C[AB: Yes, good. You could also go to 3-3.

I chose a two-space jump because of the considerable room around the C7 stone. A good choice?]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[ii];B[cg]C[AB: Your two stones are not weak, no way can White kill them. Your move is good, because it puts pressure on C10.

attacking C10 and preparing for extension along top. the J11 stone made me woried about my two lower left black stones]
;W[mn];B[ej]C[AB: No, very good! The balance of power on the right is now in your favor. Imagine a White stone there, the situation would be very different. Black has now a definite lead.

too soon, right? i think i was worried about my C7 and F7 stones (imagining them enclosed in a white moyo)]
;W[pg];B[pf];W[og];B[of];W[nf];B[ng]LB[od:a]C[AB: Your move is not bad. Given the fact that you are ahead a simple move, such as P16 would do.

I think this cut was overzealous, but not totally sure. I suppose the bulding of a white wall wouldn't have been too bad, given my stones in the lower right, correct? I also would have further closed off the corner.]
;W[mg];B[nh];W[pi];B[ne];W[mf];B[qc]C[AB: Good.];W[me];B[nd]
;W[md];B[jc]LB[nj:a][oi:b]TR[ng][nh][og][pg][pi]C[AB: The first move of yours I don't like. The marked stones are the focus of the game now. You should take the opportunity to get ahead in this fight. A simple move like O10 would be good, P11 also looks strong.]
;W[mc];B[dk]LB[nj:a][di:b]C[AB: No, your move is not bad and playing in this area is big as it settles the situation completely. Still, O10 looked more important and locally I would prefer D11.

In retrospect, this move (35) was probably overconcentrating my efforts, right? My goal was to kill the C10 stone, but should I have let play on the left side progess naturally? I think I should have been more concerned with my O12 and O13 stones, which were at risk. Sacrificing those two stones seemed like it would have cost me the game.]
;W[qg];B[rg]C[AB: No, your move is good. A White move at S14 (if you play elsewhere) would be big.

helping out white too much here with respect to my two cutting stones on O?]
;W[rh];B[rf];W[nb];B[ob];W[ql]LB[nj:a]C[AB: The White move looks good, but I think O10 is really the key point. White at O10 would be severe.]
;B[qm]C[AB: Not bad, but also helping White.];W[mb];B[pc];W[hc]
;B[ie]TR[jc]LB[pl:a]C[AB: I would treat the K17 stone lightly. White is strong locally, so you cannot expect too much. I would take the opportunity to take control on the right with Q8. K17 is not dead, and even if you lose the stone it doesn't matter too much.

I wasn't sure how to handle this attack, given white's thickness on the right. Originally I played a one point jump, but I undid the move to lean more toward my strength on the left.]
;W[fc];B[gd]LB[dc:a]C[AB: Just a simple move like D17 is sufficient. Black cannot lose.]
;W[gc];B[gf];W[id];B[jd];W[je]C[AB: A little bit of a loss here...]
;B[jf];W[ke];B[if];W[jh]C[AB: Small.];B[pl]TR[ng][nh]C[AB: Excellent. Takes control of the right side. The importance of the two marked stones is now reduced as the two White groups that they separate are more or less alive.

beginning to try to connect the O stones.];W[qk];B[nj];W[pk]
;B[ol];W[nk]
(;B[mh]LB[ok:a]C[AB: Bad! Pushing through at P9 was absolutely necessary as it would also separate the White O9 stone, which would make the whole fight much easier for Black (see variation).]
;W[ok]C[AB: Important!];B[lj];W[kg]C[AB: Now the Black group becomes a bit of a burden, too large to give it up now.]
;B[kl];W[lk];B[kk];W[mj];B[mi];W[mk];B[ki];W[ik];B[jj];W[ij]
;B[jm];W[im];B[il];W[hl];B[in];W[jl];B[kn];W[hn];B[kp];W[mp]
;B[io];W[lm];B[km];W[ho];B[jo];W[dc]LB[cc:a]TR[hl][hn][ho][ii]
[ij][ik][im][jh][jl]C[AB: You see that you had difficulties now, which were unnecessary. Middle game fighting is most important, something you should focus on. The marked White stones greatly reduce your potential on the left, and they appeared automatically by attacking your weak group. White could have also gone to C17 I think.]
;B[cc];W[ec];B[ed]LB[cb:a]C[AB: C18 would be big. You could in return give up the G16 stone, it would be ok.]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[cd];B[ce];W[cb];B[bd];W[lh];B[li];W[lo];B[ll]
;W[ko];B[mm];W[ml];B[ln];W[nm];B[nn];W[mo];B[nl];W[lm];B[hm]
;W[gm];B[mm];W[om];B[pm];W[lm];B[ph]C[AB: Of course. If you continue R12 you capture the three White stones and your group is connected to the corner.

was this even a threat?];W[qh];B[mm];W[oo]C[AB: This move is absolutely terrible. Not only does not threaten anything, it basically forces Black to play a good move to resolve the situation.]
;B[on]C[AB: Now the game is again hopeless for White.];W[nm]
;B[om]C[AB: Yes, well, you had two options. Simple alternative was to give up the two stones while there were only two of them. Otherwise the big mistake in fighting was to let White break through with O9 and P9.

how should i have handled this whole line? connecting those two stones i felt was very clumsy.]
;W[ro]C[AB: Yes, unpleasent.

this stone freaked me out. I don't know how to handle this kind of invasion and I don't know how to enact these invasions either.]
;B[po]LB[rn:a]C[AB: Mmh, a little slack. You could try S6.]
;W[lq]C[AB: Was this necessary?];B[rl]C[AB: Simple and good.]
;W[rk];B[rm];W[oh];B[cq]C[AB: Perfect. Secures the win in a simple way.

good time to invade? or much earlier?];W[qq];B[pq];W[qr];B[pr]
;W[jk]C[AB: Useless.];B[rn]C[AB: I think S2 would kill the corner.]
;W[qo];B[rp];W[qp];B[so];W[rq];B[sp];W[sn];B[sm];W[ps];B[os]
LB[or:a]C[AB: Small mistake. If you simply play P2 White cannot do anything as walking on the first line is useless.]
;W[or];B[qs];W[rs];B[sr]C[AB: You could also simply connect at Q1 and let White live in the corner. But White would not gain much territory on the bottom. If you fight the ko and lose it it is not small.

right move? i though this fight was also very clumsy];W[ps]
;B[ns]C[AB: Can you win this?];W[qs];B[ls];W[sq];B[sn];W[nr]
;B[ms];W[lr];B[js];W[mr];B[ks];W[jr];B[hs];W[is];B[ir];W[hr]
;B[rr];W[kh]C[AB: Ridiculous! White had to capture at J1 of course.]
;B[qn]C[AB: Game over for the tenth time :-).];W[qd];B[rd];W[rc]
;B[rb];W[cl];B[bl]C[AB: Yes, ok.

was the hane underneath ok?];W[dm];B[ck];W[bm];B[dl];W[ss];B[sr]
;W[kr];B[rr];W[cp];B[dq];W[bq];B[br];W[bo];B[aq];W[ap];B[ar]
C[AB: You could capture the ko at least once before connecting, but it's ok. White E3, Black E2, that should work.

this sequence ok? it seems like i was ready to be killed at this point. how would i deal with white E3?]
;W[cn];B[eq]C[AB: Still, very big.];W[fl];B[fk];W[ei];B[di]
;W[bs];B[cs];W[ds];B[as];W[ji];B[kj];W[dr];B[er];W[re];B[sc]
;W[oc];B[od];W[cl];B[bk];W[ee];B[ef];W[ff];B[de];W[es];B[fs]
;W[fr];B[cr];W[ge];B[he];W[es];B[ds];W[dh];B[eh];W[eg];B[fi]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[fg];B[gh];W[hg];B[gg];W[ps];B[qs];W[ch];B[ci]
;W[hd];B[ge];W[cf];B[bf];W[dg];B[df];W[bc];B[cd];W[ad];B[bb]
;W[ab];B[ac];W[aa];B[ba];W[bi];B[bh];W[bj];B[dj];W[bg];B[ag]
;W[al];B[ak];W[am];B[db];W[ib];B[fo];W[se];B[gr]C[AB: It's really hard to estimate from this game against the computer. But clearly you are stronger than a beginner, I think 10K maybe ok. I would clearly advise you to play human opponents, no need to be anxious at all. Everybody is looking for the same thing there :-). The computer makes quite acceptable moves 90% of the time, but inbetween there are some really bad ones that no human would make. Hope you find some of this helpful!
Good luck!


given how i played, what's a good estimate of my strength? I have been too anxious to try playing against humans online, so I don't have a good sense of how I'm doing. I figured that I would learn a good amount playing the computer, but I bet I'm learning bad habits this way.]
