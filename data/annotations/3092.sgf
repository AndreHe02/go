C[Dear reviewer,
I played this game as black as 1kyu on IGS.  I felt I played the initial portion of the game poorly, but managed to bring the game close towards the late middle-game.  However, many of the positions, especially the endgame plays were simply too complex for me to completely read out.  I've been told in the past that my direction is often wrong as well, so any pointers there would be greatly appreciated.

Dear black stone player,

Thanks for the opportunity to review your game. Please be aware that the truth about go is only known to high ranking pro players. My own humble comments are only useful in that they may stimulate your own thinking into new exploratory areas of go. 

By the way, since I don't understand the endgame, I won't be able to comment much there. Sorry.

Enjoy.

John Stephenson 1/2/2004];B[pd];W[nc]C[W2: unusual. Black can tenuki an approach to the 4-4 stone and play at E17, which may turn out to be useful on the top.]

(;B[qf]C[B3: of course this is fine too. It is nearly sente against O17.]
;W[dd]C[Black has a 2:1 situation against the white stone in the upper right so would like to punish that stone. If Black cannot see how to punish it right away, Black should play elsewhere with that aji in mind. (The normal punishment is make it heavy with P17 and then squeeze around L16, but it seems early).]

(;B[pq]TR[qf]C[B5: my opinion is that the marked stone makes the right side a bit played out already (less developable). Therefore, if I were to play in the lower right, I would play P3, making the white normal approach of R4 not particularly desireable. 

However, in choosing to play a big point, the guideline is play in the most open public area. The lower left corner has more lines between D16 than the lower right corner has between R14. In other words, the lower left corner is larger, in theory, than the lower right corner. 

Locally, in the lower left corner, C4 is better than D3, because White doesn't get to use his star stone as a backup when approaching.]
;W[eq];B[cp]C[B7: biggest move.];W[cn]C[W8: wants to develop the left. Ok.]
;B[do]C[B9: has to move the inside stone out.]
(;W[cr]C[W10: too early. White needs to continue to develop the left and answer the contact move. See variation.]
;B[dn];W[cm]C[W12: these white stones are heavy now.];B[fp]
C[B13: this leans on the bottom to prepare an attack on the left.]

(;W[gq]C[W14: must be at F3.];B[fq];W[fr]
(;B[gr]C[B17: cut at E2 instead. The outside is better early.]
;W[hr];B[er];W[gs];B[dq];W[gp]C[I didn't actually foresee the sequence that eventually followed here.

G4 is sente; must answer.]
(;B[fc];W[cf]C[W24: slack. As far as the top goes, White needs to pincer black while extending from his O17 stone. It's ideal.]
;B[db]C[B25: likewise, Black needs to help F17 by extending and squeezing the O17 white stone. Early in the game, Black wanted to punish the O17 white stone but maybe wasn't sure which direction would be right. Now it's clear.]
;W[gc]
(;B[fd]C[Is this right? I feel awkward here.

This G17 is a famous Korean style quasi trick move. The natural looking answer of F16 allows white to damage the black shape. G16, hane, is usual; G18 is more cash oriented and also doable.]
;W[gd];B[lc]C[B29: really greedy. When you are engage in a close fight, like on the top left, you need to keep going until you stabilize. You can tell if you're stable when you don't have problems with the 3 basic foodstuffs of the go game:

1. Have liberty shortage?
2. Have connection problem?
3. Have basic problem?

If you answer yes to any of those, then you group is still unstable and uncomfortble; you must continue.]
;W[fe]C[W30: huge move sealing in Black's stones.];B[cc];W[cd]
;B[fb];W[ep];B[fo];W[dr];B[eo];W[es]
(;B[ge]C[B39: of course you want to cut. But does the bottom black group require urgent attention now? Unless you can give it all up, you don't have the time for this G15 cut.]
;W[ff];B[he]
(;W[hn]C[W42: Seems like E8 is a better direction to attack. Helps two potentially weak white stones and develops the left.]

(;B[el]C[B43: D9 to press the two weak white stones might look good but White can resist I think. See variation.]
;W[dk];B[ic]C[B45: wow. Another tenuki. If you wanted to give up the whole heavy mess on the bottom left, why did you come out with E8?]

(;W[fj]C[I get pushed around a lot here.  Was there a better way to run or am I simply paying the price for the greedy J17?

You need to know when to tenuki and when to continue locally. The guideline is simple. Unless you intend to sacrifice something, then continue locally until you don't have a liberty shortage problem, a connection problem or a base problem. (If it is an outside group, interpret base  as a wide open pathway to the center.)

W46: slack? G9 is more pressure.];B[gl];W[il];B[gj];W[fk];B[gk]

C[B61: yes, a nice erasing move locally. But is your large black group ok, such that you may tenuki?]
