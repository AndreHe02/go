C[Hi my name is Andrew and I played black in this game. I feel I did well. I know that I still need a lot of work, but I am trying my hardest to improve every single day. This game was played against a person a Tygem (we are both 17 kyu). I have come to the realization that players on Tygem LOVE to go on the offensive. This threw me off when I first played on the server (lost like 5 games in a row), but I feel I have become a bit better because of their relentlessness. Anyways I digress. I shall have comments added throughout along with different variations that I feel may have worked out better. Any and all comments are appreciated.

Okay hello Andrew My name is Taylor I will be going over your game and giving comments on your play.

I do have expirence playing on Tygem and they are really agressive which can help you improve in fighting but it can hurt you 
when you play against a calmer player who can read deeply and reduce the best way to improve is to play against both calm and agressive players.]

;B[fn];W[en];B[em];W[dn];B[dm];W[fl]TR[dj]C[Again aggressive behavior. This really tends to bug me.
This is not too agressive it is a group trying to live so white should poke and remove any eyes white has the stenght to try and get the stone out  thanks to that stone.]

;W[gh];B[fg]C[I listed a better variation white lives here at about 17kyu it would be hard to read out that it lives but with some life and death problems you can improve your abillity to see what lives and what dies.]

;B[ce];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[ch]C[I like this outcome for my stones on the right. I wasn't sure how they would live since white's center group lived.
This is something you need to always think about before making an attack can I make my group live if I am not capablie of killing his stones.]
;W[ef];B[ei];W[gi]C[Another unnecessary move by white.
Yeah another wasted move];B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[dc];B[cb];W[db]
;B[lj]LB[qe:B][qf:A][pj:C][qk:D]C[Was this a good time to play this move? or were there bigger points to take?
Yes this was good timing to play away and there are bigger points but this is not the biggest point A-D are bigger points for black and white.]

;B[sk]C[I take a minute to play out several different variations and concluded that this was the vital spot to white's survival.]
;W[rl]C[White connects and see that his group is dead so he resigns. The moves after this point are something I spotted while reviewing this game myself. 
Okay and white resignes here it was over all a really great game Black did great in attacking and living on the left hand side.]
;B[am]C[Found this tesuji while reviewing the game. Any and all comments are appreciated. I feel I handled my opponents aggressive behavior decently (better than I normally do). Thanks.
And that was a tesuji worth a lot of points. I hope you enjoyed the review and that it helped you learn something feel free to email me with any questions or if you need another review in the future. litteral_taylor@yahoo.com]
