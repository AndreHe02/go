C[Hello, I play white in this game.  My real rank is around 4-5 kyu (my rank on KGS seems to have inflated during a period where I wasn't playing for a while).



I made some very foolish moves in the endgame, but by then the game was over I believed.  I'm not really sure how I fell so far behind.  So -- I would like to know where I went astray in the beginning and middle game.



Thank you in advance for taking the time to do a review.

-----------

i hope this review is helpful. your main problems i peg as questionable direction of play and a lack of tesuji feeling.

direction of play comes with time, and with concious thought and review of games. be reasonable about how much territory you can create. 

observe the exchanges 12 for 13, and 42 for 43.];B[pq]C[as a point of etiquette, this move should be in the upper-right]
;W[pd];B[ed]C[this is usually considered odd in combination with the opposite 3-4. one corner wants territory and another wants influence. however, at our level there's no real difference.]
;W[cp];B[qo];W[jq];B[cd];W[dj];B[ep]
(;W[gq];B[fo]
(;W[dq]C[odd];B[eq]C[i'm not sure about this exchange. maybe better just to jump to D6. after E3, black can attack the bottom side more easily.]
;W[cn];B[lq]
(;W[lp]C[questionable. see var];B[mp];W[kp];B[mo]C[these exchanges make black very solid in the corner. but does white get adequate compensation for that? i'm not sure.]

(;W[ho]C[slow. after making the M4 exchange, at least jump out faster]
;B[fm];W[cg];B[hc];W[qj];B[nc];W[pf];B[pb];W[qc];B[ld];W[qm]
LB[eg:A]C[question: Unimportant?  'a' better?

no, R7 is not unimportant at all! it's very big. it reduces the corner and makes territory for white at the same time. A isn't so big because black can't invade around C11 without making you really strong.]
;B[he];W[hl]C[it's hard to attack this black group effectively right now. maybe better to make a leaning attack. however, there's not much to lean on right now...]
;B[fk];W[el];B[fl];W[eg];B[hk];W[gn];B[fn];W[ik];B[hj]
(;W[pn];B[po]C[not a good exchange for white!]
(;W[ne]C[this move is slow. you have no followup and it doesn't build much territory.]
;B[ij]
(;W[nn]C[j10 cannot be ignored! and this move does very little. you can't build much territory on the right when black is strong in the middle]

(;B[mn]C[bad];W[nm];B[jk]C[ouch]
(;W[mm];B[lf]C[white has played in all the wrong directions for the last few moves. this is the big turning point of the game i believe. white has invested several moves into getting a large territory on the right side, but it's just not possible to make up for what was lost. there's no way to make this part big with one move]
;W[mg];B[lj];W[nj];B[lg];W[mh];B[gg]C[the game now favors black]
;W[lh];B[kh]C[At this point, I felt I had to make the bottom middle group live.

it's probably impossible to kill, but possible to attack. so this is probably a decent strategy. but you should start with J8.]

(;W[lr];B[mr];W[kr]C[with black to move, looks like about:



27+40+10=77 white

59+21=80 black


that seems about right, but black is thicker everywhere, so with sente can expect to make a lot of points in the endgame.]

(;B[dm]C[From here, black takes all the engame.

to be expected, yeah.];W[cm];B[dl];W[cl];B[dk];W[ck];B[rn];W[rm]

C[futile it seems, but I feel like I have to take a chance.  Looks like I'm about 20 points behind.

looks like there's no way for white at this point to me. however, if you're going to try something, play A12 first. black will probably tenuji, and then you'll have more aji in a fight here.]
