AB[pd][dp]C[Hey reviewer!  I feel like I've reached a new "phase" in my Go playing, as my games have become much more difficult.  Now that my opponents have stopped making major mistakes by either losing a large group or letting me build a moyo, the efficiency of my moves are more important.  So I'm looking for help with shape and things like heavy or overconcentrated etc.  Of course, any advice would be appreciated :-)  Also, I tend to have trouble of leaving a weak group too early, so if you see that I'd like to know and possibly why it's weak (potential weaknesses).d]
;W[pq]C[hello! i'm eugochan, currently 5k after losing a whole stretch of games! first rule, dont play when you are tired!

will be happy to review your game.];B[cd];W[ed];B[dc];W[ec]

(;B[hc]LB[dc:A][ic:B][jc:C][mc:D][de:E]C[I realized after playing A that this wouldn't be an even result if white get's a large jump off of his/her wall, so I tried a pincer,  In hindsight, that was a bad idea, violating "play away from thickness".  Would a stone a little further away work OK in this, like B, C, or D or should I just let w jump and play something E?


eugochan: i think D would be better because it builts on your corner stone while putting pressure on the white group. you dont need to play so close to it.]

I keep forgetting the 4-4 is for influence, and since I try to play a more territorial game handi games get me.]

(;W[pl]C[The reason why a larger jump was nice, maybe on the 4th line?

eugochan:i dont think white should play here. he's playing inside your stones without any backup support from his other stones. he's also playing a bit too close to your black group, and too high up. how is he going to live?]
