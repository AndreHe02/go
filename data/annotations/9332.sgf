Hi Ziad,

Thank you for sending your game in for review.  

I'm looked over the game and I'm not sure how much you will get out of the review because it was lost through technique rather than strategy, but I have pointed out things you may have missed and hopefully that will be helpful.]

I personally would've preferred the 9th line because K4 is quite distant and Q3 is unbalanced, but it is a minor point]
;W[eq]C[--
This is a mistake by white];B[fp];W[dn];B[lc]C[--
Right, you take the area white should have taken and are now winning]
;W[qo]C[--
There was an interesting book on choosing the right joseki which addresses positions like this.

Personally I find it really hard.  You've got a few different choices but your opponent is unlikely to fit with what you want, so which one works best.

Having guessed which variation will happen, it's a matter of picking which you would most like.  Personally I quite like R4 here, but it is well beyond my level to know which is the right joseki to choose.  

Say you played R4, where do you think white will play and so what result would you expect?  Say you played R7, which joseki would result?]

I think simply extending at O5 is better in this situation because of the strength of K4]

I would have played O7 directly to threaten this move myself]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[lr];B[nr]C[--
I would consider M3 first to make white heavy - especially since white O4 is forcing so you are not likely to want to atari from the other direction.]
;W[kq];B[qn]C[--
I think this is too direct, it gets you O7 for free, but O7 is not so important.  I think I would have played N4, though K3 also looks interesting.]

I like P11, I can't see a good answer for black.];B[km];W[in]

I think this move is premature.  White is very safe there with many ways out, I would save this until / if L7 gets strong]

I think B9 is a small mistake, if white had played C9 then there would be no problematic aji left for white]

you just died - A5 kills you now]

white could kill with A5, but I would have played here too.  A5 can be played any time]

This is very direct?  I would have left it a few moves myself]

This move prevents D7 which looked interesting to me.  I would tenuki so you can choose between D9 and D7 later.]

B15 is very strong, so I'm not convinced by this sequence.  

You don't have any eyes there before it, and you don't have two eyes after it.  I don't think a single eye justifies the damage it will do to E9.]
;W[bi];B[fj]C[--
I don't understand this move in conjunction with B12.  Are you trying to save both?]
;W[fi];B[gj];W[gi];B[hj];W[hi];B[ij]

This feels a little soft by white to me. I would have captured the left and struggled to live with L6.  I can't see you killing it.]
;B[ii];W[ih];B[jh];W[ig];B[ki];W[ic]C[--
White now feels well ahead, though the strategy is a little risky as the left can still be reduced.]

Yes, you're in trouble now and have to try something very risky.]

I wouldn't have thrown in.  You're going to be lucky to get white to answer M11 at all, and it's even less likely after this move.]

The game is over now - white has avoided your trap on the left and so E12 will die.  White can kill with A5 an time but even without it whiteis ahead

In the upper right you have 25 points. 
In the central group you have 5 points
In the lower right you have 16 points
In the lower middle you have 5 points
In the lower left - if it lives - you have 3 points

So in total you have about 55 points.  Compare to white:

On the right white has 25 points
On the lower left white has 4 points
On the central / left group white has 65
Also white has 5 more captures and komi

So white is ahead by about 50 points];B[cc];W[ce];B[eb];W[fb]

Overall I think it was fighting technique which made the biggest difference in this game rather strategic moves.

You alluded to this in your comments, but I think you need to become a better fighter rather than avoiding the fights.

That said, small groups rather than big moyos do lead to games with simpler fights.]
