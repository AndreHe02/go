C[Cam [4k?\]: Hi

Hello the review comments will start with R.];B[pp];W[pd];B[dd]
;W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qn];B[nq];W[pj];B[nc];W[pf];B[jd]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[ci]C[Question: This opening has been rather symmetric. How is it? Good or bad playing?

R: Looks fair to me. The only thing that I would point is that both players used hoshi (D4, D16, Q16, Q4) to start in the corners. They are moves made for attack. Then the flow of the game seems focused on territory. That is just my feeling, I absolutely can't say there was a mistake.]
;B[dh]
(;W[ef]C[I didn't want black to have a wall (which he got anyway, as it would turn out), because he could expand his moyo by playing on the right, and I would have no counter.

R: now I can say that I think I see a mistake. Probably what you did not want was a big black territory. This is called being greedy, in go.
1) you need to stay connected, or you will have two weak groups. See what happens in the game for the next 30 moves or more.
2) There is actually no problem letting black have that wall. Well nothing as alarming as being split in two. See variations for an example.
3) You also need to think about your game: what do you want to do with your stones? Countering the opponent is not enough.]
;B[ch];W[bj]C[R: well the trouble really starts here. You have two groups, and it is clear with this move that you intend to cling to both. Black has the upper hand.]
;B[bg];W[de]C[R: I don't think this move is necessary. Plus, it is not forcing on black D16. So, just run away with F13 seems better.]
;B[bf];W[be];B[bc]C[R: unnecessary also and not sente, thank you mister Black.]
;W[fh]C[R: Should be at F13 in my opinion. The group is very weak, it is better not tot leave a cutting point.]

;B[jf];W[ie];B[je];W[id];B[hf];W[gf];B[ic];W[hc];B[hd];W[he]
;B[gd]C[R: The result up to here looks like a disaster for white, who lives with 4 points. In the process, Black has made around 20 points in the upper left, AND has built a nice wall. This could have been avoided by staying connected (twice).]

(;W[fk]C[See variation for 60];B[gk];W[fl];B[ck];W[cj];B[gl]
;W[fm];B[gm];W[gn];B[hn];W[go];B[hq]
(;W[on]C[I think 72 is well timed, because 71 protects the 3 space extension, as does 72, so they are of about equal value. Right?

R: making this sort of valuation is out of my league ;)
However, what can I say about it?
H3 is not bad because it is solid and when in the lead playing solid and simple is good. Therefore white lost a chance to make something on the lower side. P6 does not fully protect the 3 space extension. The right side is still open and black is very strong in the center. However white does not have the time to play solidly, and cannot protect the whole side. So black will definitely invade now, that cannot be avoided. But at our levels, you can still kill the invader or something ;) Game not over yet.]
;B[ph]C[However, when black invades at 73, I realize there are going to be some problems!]

R: I don't think that changes much. The situation is tough for white anyway. This move makes a few points, but not much. White has to worry about the right side being invaded, and about how to come back. Now, where to play instead ? I don't know, maybe try to make something happen on the lower side, with K3 ? Difficult choice.]

(;W[ch];B[df];W[dg];B[eg];W[cg];B[de]C[R: let's say black completes the wall. Well OK, it's looking neat for black. But you got sente, you can cerase that moyo if you want. M17 is a weakness for example, or you can come at H14 pretty safely. It's not that big.
If you don't like that result at all, where you get territory and black gets a wall, then beforehand you should not play C12 which is a territory move. Play on the fourth line instead.]
