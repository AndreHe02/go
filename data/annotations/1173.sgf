C[Thanks for reviewing this.

 I've added my own comments which I've labeled "mgt74:", and a few variations as well, so you could see what I wasa thinking. Please give feedback, to let me know if I am thinking about the right things.

 As you will see, I am quite weak at Joseki. I think I made up for it by connecting and separating stones to save or kill important groups later in the game.

Just in terms of introduction, I have been playing for about 3-4 months, and have read an introductory book and the "Second Book of Go". I am eagerly awaiting a book on the opening so I can improve my strategy there.

All comments welcome and appreciated.   Thanks,
greg - mgt74)];B[dd]C[SpaceDog: I'll do my best. I'm about 8 kyu on NNGS, which corresponds (roughly) to something like 11 - 14 kyu on IGS. So I'm by no means an expert.

Regarding the opening, I personally don't think you should worry about joseki until later; or rather, if you do study it, it is understanding the ideas behind the moves that matter, rather than memorising the moves themselves.

A good book on the opening in general is "In the Beginning".]
;W[pp]C[SpaceDog: Incidentally, a lot of my comments are in the variations, so make sure you go over those as well as the main tree.]
;B[cp];W[pc];B[qe]LB[eq:a];W[qd]LB[qg:a]C[SpaceDog: I feel I should say that this isn't a great move, though in truth I don't think it's *that* bad. But white seems here and later too concerned with defending the corner. He could be aggressive and pincer Black's stone with a move at or near a. This would remove Black's room to make eyes and force him into the centre.

The variation shows Black's best response to White's actual move.]

(;B[re]LB[pe:a]C[mgt74: I think this wasn't a very good response on my part, and that "a" would have been better.  Any thoughts, or is it too small to matter?

SpaceDog: No, this is definitely important. You're correct, a is better. One thing to realise is that gaining influence over the centre of the board is important. Moves on the second line have no such influence and are rarely good early on.

White could now play at a himself, getting good influence over the top of the board.

I realise it's hard for someone new to understand influence; I don't think I can it into words I could understand myself. It's something that you'll develop a feel for after playing for a while, so don't worry if it's hard to grasp now.]
;W[rd]C[Probably too concerned with the corner territory, which is not, after all, very big, so a different move might have been better.]

(;B[pg]LB[pe:a][qh:b]C[SpaceDog: Perhaps a is still good, preventing a white move there. I realise White might then attack the stones with something like b, but see variation.]
;W[pe];B[pf];W[oe]LB[lc:a]C[Good. Now, White has influence over the top. Imagine, for example, how weak a black stone at a or thereabouts would be. This has mainly been possible because of Black's earlier move on the second line.]
;B[qj];W[kc]LB[rf:a][jd:a]C[
mgt74: I feel that White did better inthis exchange, especially considering he still has the endgame move at "a" available. At least I keep sente...]
;B[nq];W[np];B[mp];W[no];B[oq];W[ql]LB[qn:a][pq:b]C[SpaceDog: Unusual. I feel it's bad but I'm not good enough to know precisely why. Though if Black responds with a this might hurt White. The standard move for White, instead of the move he played here, would be b, defending a fair amount of corner territory.]
;B[qq]LB[qr:a]C[mgt74: this got a little messy. I think "a" would have worked out nicer? In the end, I did manage to profit on the right, but I think that was luck, certainly not planned at this point...]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[qp];AB[rq]C[mgt74: if the labelling is funny, ignore it. I accidentally deleted this move, and re-inserted it... still just learning this editor. I played at S3, but think that S2 would have been better, considering what happens next...]
;W[or]
(;B[nr]LB[qr:a]C[SpaceDog: I think Black a would be fine.];W[qr]
;B[ps];W[rr];B[rn]C[mgt74: okay, if he's going to capture my pieces, I at lesat need to put up a good fight....]
;W[rp]TR[ql]LB[qn:a]C[SpaceDog: In view of what happens next, perhaps best for White just to let Black have the corner, and connect the marked stone to the rest of the group with a. The amount of territory he would lose is not so great.]
;B[rl];W[rk];B[qk];W[rm];B[rj];W[sk];B[pl];W[sl]LB[qm:a]C[No, White should try to stay connected, ie a instead.]

(;B[pm]C[mgt74: hmmm maybe Q7 better at R7 as in above variation..]
;W[qn];B[qm];W[ro];B[pn];W[sn]LB[pk:a][ok:b]C[mgt74: I think white let me profit far too much from this... Also, I'm still in sente. I am a bit worried about him cutting at "a" since the ladder to the UL favors him...

SpaceDog: Black can catch the cut with b. See variation.]
(;B[jq]TR[pn][pm][pl][qk][qj][pg][pf]LB[op:a][oo:b][po:c]MA[jo]
[jn][jm][jl][jk]C[mgt74: I was also a bit worried about what white could do to my stones on the bottom, so I thought it smart to reinforce and claim territory at this point, giving up sente.

Yes, this seems to solidify Black's position on the bottom well. But there's another possibility to consider, which will make use of the central power of Black's marked stones -

Black can cut White with a, and if White b then Black c. Now White has some very weak stones which are almost surrounded by Black. Even if he lives in the coming moves, Black can chase him with moves somewhere near the Xs, building up a massive framework on the left.

See the variation for a guess as to how this might work.];W[mo]
;B[lp];W[op]C[White sees the danger.];B[gc]TR[kc]LB[dj:a]C[mgt74: I don't think this was a great move for me to make.  I felt like I was ahead, and the battles were essentially settled, so I wanted to  reinforce my corners. I guess this doesn't really secure the corner anyway, and doesn't do much to the marked white stone either... Maybe "a"  would be much bigger?? I have trouble choosing these types of moves...

SpaceDog: I think a is a possibility.];W[qs]C[mgt74: I guess he was concerned about the 2 points in the corner??]

(;AB[os]AE[or]C[mgt74: in hindsight, I should have ignored him and let him capture my 2 stones--only about 5 points, and I could have taken D10... (again, if the labelling is bad, it's because of the editor)

SpaceDog: I agree. White's threat is tiny.];W[cj];B[eq]LB[hq:a]
[cl:a][cg:b]C[mgt74: too timid? I felt like I was ahead, and just wanted to guarantee the bottom and corner there. I guess he can still attack at "a"? But it would be a hard fight for him

SpaceDog: I'm not sure. Which ever side you move towards him, he can go the other way. For example, if you play a, he plays b. On the other hand, a is a good point for you to take. Perhaps you could play a before E3; if white takes b, you can then play E3.]
;W[cg]LB[cm:a][cl:b]TR[jq][lp]C[SpaceDog: Probably the wrong way for White to go. I think he should play a instead, preventing Black from extending upwards and creating a huge framework in the lower left. ie a Black move at b works quite well with the triangled stones.]
;B[ce]LB[cd:a][dc:b]C[mgt74: again too timid? I just wanted to have that corner secure since I feel my position is stronger.

SpaceDog: I don't think it is secure even yet. Stones on the 4-4 point can usually be invaded by a stone on the 3-3 point. With 3 nearby black stones, such an invasion becomes difficult, but still possible. If you really want to defend the corner, a is more secure. An invasion on the 3-3 point is then easily killed with b, firmly locking the white stone up. See variation for a 3-3 invasion.]

(;W[cm]C[mgt74: I certainly let him claim a lot of territory unopposed.... and gave him a ton of influence toward the center.

SpaceDog: Hmm, his stones are on the third line, which normally means they don't influence the centre too much. Stones on the 4th line are more centre-oriented. This is another of those things I have difficulty explaining precisely why...]
;B[dn];W[kf];B[nf];W[of];B[og]
(;W[ne]LB[ng:a]C[SpaceDog: Instead, a cut at a might cause Black trouble.]
;B[mf];W[me];B[lf];W[ke];B[kg]LB[pk:a]C[mgt74: Now I have my ladder breaker so he can't cut at "a"... but....]
;W[mk]TR[kg][lf][mf][nf][og]C[SpaceDog: Let me tell you one of the things that I had trouble accepting until quite recently. Walls, such as the triangled stones, are often not good at making territory. I know it feels like you should be able to make territory, but a wall's true strength is that it can help you attack nearby enemy stones, especially if those stones are isolated.

So, can the white stone at N9 be isolated?

Yes. See variation, and comments there.]
(;B[nm]TR[mk][pl][pm][pn][qm]LB[pk:a][oj:b][mm:c]C[mgt74: I thought a lot about this move, and I hope this is a good one... My reasons are
1) Begin threat  to confine white's marked stone if he keeps attacking--his only quick connection is with his bottom group
2) connect with marked black stones in case he makes a cut at "a"

essentially, I was trying to scare him into running out, or else I would confine and kill his stones if he kept attacking.

maybe black "b" would have been simpler than the move played, but  I wanted to try attacking, not just defending.


SpaceDog: I think c instead. See the variation. After your move, White can play c himself, which comes close to connecting. White c remains a possibility for some time.]
;W[mh]C[mgt74: for the next 5 or 6 moves, I am just trying to keep my weak stones from being attacked while limiting white's attacking stones' liberties...]

(;B[lh]LB[ng:a]C[SpaceDog: If you're going to defend the cut, I think you should play one move that defends both cuts simultaneously. Black a instead of the move you play for example.   See variation for what happens if White tries the cut.]
;W[mi];B[nh];W[mg];B[li];W[ng]LB[lg:a]TR[kg][lh][li]C[SpaceDog: I think the other cut is better, and then the triangled black stones are themselves in trouble.]
;B[lg];W[nj];B[ni];W[mj]LB[mm:b];B[oj];W[oi];B[oh];W[ok];B[pj]
;W[pk]C[mgt74: here's the cut... so, the real fight for survival begins.]
;B[nl]TR[pl][pm][pn][qm]C[mgt74: i think this was my strongest move here--keeps my marked stones alive while threatening to cut him.]
;W[nk]
(;B[lm]TR[nm][nl][pl][pm][pn][qm][ng][mg][mh][mi][mj][mk][nj]
[nk][ok][pk]LB[ll:a]C[mgt74: at this point, I'm pretty pleased, but still a bit scared. he only has 4 liberties, and needs to run, and i'm pretty comfortable that my marked  black group is connected, with friendly stones to run toward if necessary. I'm a little worried about my group around M13, but hope to make eyes while threatening his maked group, or run to the upper left if there's no other choice.

SpaceDog: I think a instead actually catches White completely and kills him. See variation.]
;W[ml];B[mm];W[kk];B[lo]LB[kn:a]C[mgt74: here, the only other option I could see was "a"]
;W[ik];B[jh]LB[ig:a]C[SpaceDog: You should move faster, ie at a.]
;W[ln];B[kn];W[mn];B[jm]C[mgt74: i think he gained nothing from that exchange, while I secured a nice wall facing my moyo.]
;W[hm];B[jj]TR[kg][lh][li][lg][lf][jh][mf][nf]LB[jk:a][il:b]
[hl:c][hk:d]C[mgt74: I think this was probably a bad move--peeping at cut point. At this point, I thought he would live for sure, and wanted to make eye shape for my marked group. I think I should have done it in another direction maybe, and kept that cut at "a" open.

SpaceDog: I'm afraid I'm not sure. There are some complex possibilities here, on account of the fact that the white group is itself still vulnerable. I'm uncertain, but perhaps b, White c, Black d, cutting White and creating 2 weak white groups. On the other hand, since you have a weak group yourself, I can't be sure how this would turn out.]
;W[jk]
(;B[kj]LB[if:a]C[mgt74: again, I don't think this was a very good move I made, but I was trying to secure my eyes... probably best done elsewhere, but I am not very good at making eyes. I did a variation above that seems to work ok for black by not playing this move. But, white may be better than me at killing my stones... ;-)

SpaceDog: Possibly a instead, reaching towards your black stones in the corner.]
;W[ho];B[jf]C[mgt74: as above, probably not good, just trying to guarantee i have 2 eyes, and maybe secure some territory toward the upper left]
;W[fg];B[hg];W[fe];B[fd];W[hi];B[gf];W[ff];B[le];W[ld];B[jd]
;W[kd];B[je];W[ic]LB[gh:a]C[mgt74: here I had 5 seconds on the clock to make 3 moves.... so they were just instinct reactions, not thought out....

SpaceDog: If I was White here I think I'd secure the connection at a, which should also give good territory on the left]
;B[ge];W[hd];B[jc];W[jb];B[dl]TR[hl][hk][hj][il][gh][hm][ho]
C[mgt74: At this point, I think there is a chance that I can still cut white's middle group off at one of the triangle-marked points. or at least separate and kill his marked stones. He doesn't look like he can make 2 eyes on the bottom. So, I wanted to build some strength in the square-marked area to prepare to cut him and prevent from making eyes. Here it goes...........]

;W[dq];B[ek];W[ej];B[fj];W[ei];B[gh]TR[hj]C[mgt74: I thought this would be my last chance to cut up here before he connected...and, if it fails i can still try at the marked point

SpaceDog: White should definitely have taken this point first.]
;W[gi];B[fi];W[fh];B[gj]LB[gd:a]C[SpaceDog: I feel White's best chance has now become to cut at a and hope he can prevent your central group from making two eyes, in which case he might just be able to capture it first.]
;W[hj];B[gk];W[fo];B[go];W[fp];B[gp];W[fq];B[er];W[fr];B[gq]
LB[dr:a]C[mgt74: I considered playing at "a" as well, but thought I'd better keep it simple.]
;W[gn]C[mgt74: I'm not sure what white was thinking...];B[gr]
;W[dr]C[mgt74: maybe I should have taken the ko to make it really interesting.... I wasn't in the mood for all that risk though at this point, as I felt I had one.....

SpaceDog: Absolutely no reason to take the ko whatsoever, that I can see.]
;B[fs]C[White resigns.

mgt74: White decided that I had won, and this is where he resigned....
Thanks for the review!

SpaceDog: Just to satisfy my own curiosity, I'm going to play a few moves to see what might happen if White cuts...

But anyway, I think you're doing very well for only a few month's play. IGS uses a harsh rating system; I'd guess you'd have a much better rank than 25 kyu in the real world.

I think I've been stressing the way attacks can lead to gaining strength and influence in this review. The book "Attack and Defense" looks at this. This book is not too complicated, and you might want to give it a look fairly soon, perhaps after a few more months.

But I think you're doing OK. Your games are certainly far less boring than my games as a beginner - I was too frightened to get into fights...

I've been talking a lot about influence as well... the value of this is learnt by experience, I feel, but you must remember to consider how your stones affect the centre...]
;W[gd]C[SpaceDog: This is not an actual move, White's already resigned. But I want to see what happens...]

Attacking to gain power or influence, or to build up territory or a framework, is often much better than attacking to kill. Actually killing a group is usually difficult, but if you can threaten your opponent and make him run for his life, you can often gain huge profit in the process.]

I can't predict how much value it will be to him, but it will likely be worth it.
