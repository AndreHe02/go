C[Unicornfr [11k\]: Hi
Unicornfr [11k\]: good game
Basa [11k\]: hi gg

Hi Unicornfr! My name is Jonathan Huber and I will be reviewing the game for you. All in all, you didn't play too badly. There were several chances for black to win this game, and even the mistake at the end could have been absorbed by some careful damage control. I'm not a dan player and can't comment on everything, but I will do my best to answer your questions and point out some additional things that could have swung the game in your favor. I hope this helps!]

(;B[oc]TR[pj][qj]C[This move should be at C15. Playing here at P17 makes it easy for white to take away your big extension at the marked points. In addition, both the P17 and D17 stones are low (3rd line), so it will be harder to develop this part of the board. See the variation.]
;W[ce];B[ed];W[cc]
(;B[jc]C[Unicornfr [12k\]: I don't think this move is really bad BTW

Well, it's not good. Locally, this is a joseki move if W plays D13 instead of C17, but in this position there are a couple of problems. There's the obvious weakness at G16 which White immediately attacks. In addition, although K17 is an extension from the upper right, K17 and P17 are both low (3rd line) and make it hard to grow. The alternative sequence you suggested is more solid, certainly, but you're starting to fall behind due to P17.]
;W[gd]C[Unicornfr [12k\]: I don't really know what is the best answer to this move, I would like to know please

It's hard to decide on the best way to play here. B has an awkward position right now so there's no simple way to strengthen everything with a single move. The best option would be to avoid the moves that got you here in the first place (P17, K17). However, since you're here, there are a couple of possibilities. First, you can respond locally to save the stones in one of three ways- 1) Connect to friendly stones, 2) make a base (accomplished by the the sequence you chose), or 3) run out to the center. I don't think the game play turned out too badly, but maybe this isn't the best way to play right now. 

Instead of immediately saving the stones, decide if the two black stones are really critical. They're light and easily sacrificed, plus it's hard for white to surround them since they can run out into the center. So, you could ignore them for now a take big point. K15 strengthens the top and prepares to deal with the upper left b stones later. R10 is still a big extension point. So, if you ever don't know what to do in a situation, always ask yourself if you can leave the position as is for now and return later when the overall board situation may clarify how you should treat the stones in question.]

(;B[gc];W[fc];B[fd];W[hc];B[gb];W[hb];B[fb];W[id]C[This turned out ok for b: the upper left is stable, k17 was awkward anyway, and now you have sente to make the next play.]
;B[pj]C[Unicornfr [12k\]: I suppose than this move is good, but there is still a weakness in M17

Yes, Q10 is a big move. It's a nice extension from the upper right enclosure and also prevents white from making the same extenstion. K17 is still awkward and I don't see any efficient way to play on the upper side right now. 

The upper w group is not very strong, but it can escape to the center so it's not easy to attack it yet.]

(;B[oj];W[qi];B[ng]C[Ok, so you got thickness here. How are you going to use it? White got cash, so B is counting on making up those points later using the influence of these stones.]

;W[bf];B[bg];W[cf];B[cj];W[db];B[eb];W[dd];B[ec];W[cb]C[Good result for black. White lives in corner but b is gaining more and more outside influence. The white group on the upper side is getting weaker and weaker. Don't forget that as the game proceeds.]

(;B[fi]C[Unicornfr [12k\]: I think now that this move is slow

This b group is already ok, so this is not the biggest place to play. The upper white group is weak and the rest of white's groups are safe, so W will surely play there next. This is your last chance to get the first move. I don't know if B can kill or not, but you have a lot of support so at least attack. Even if you don't kill, you can gain even more outside strength that will help you reduce white's territory in the endgame.]

Unicornfr [12k\]: Thx for the game

Thanks for the chance to review your game! The single most important thing that I think will improve your game is to ask, after every move, where is the biggest place to play? Sometimes the biggest move is the urgent move that helps one of your groups group. Sometimes all of your groups are ok for now and you can attack your opponent or take a large point. Be careful about always responding to your opponent. If you can safely ignore your opponent's move, do so and play somewhere bigger. Good luck!]
