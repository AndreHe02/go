C[Hello,   I am 17 k on IGS and 14 k on KGS.  My opponent was nominally 18 k on KGS but I think he was stronger.

I'm not really sure what I should be asking about this one.  Sometime about a quarter the way through, I lost track strategically and never caught up.  I can't identify exactly where. What might you say was the principal losing move?

Thank you

Andrew Okun];B[pp];W[dd];B[qd];W[dp];B[cf];W[dj]C[I don't normally see this move when white does not have backup around k16 and q16.  This move is saying white wants to make a wall facing right, but here this wall will not be so valuable.]
;B[dh]C[Black could also try running out faster (f14) or a double kakari (f16).]
;W[ce];B[cj];W[ck];B[bj];W[bk];B[be]
(;W[bd]C[I think white should try to seal black in instead.]

(;B[bf];W[df]C[So white gets this vital point afterall, good.]
;B[dg]C[Now e14 is the key point.  Both sides should strive to play it as soon as possible.]
;W[ci]
(;B[bi];W[di];B[ch];W[bg];B[ef]C[Black gets e14.];W[de];B[ag]
C[Now Black is alive.  What is the biggest move now?  I don't think it's e15.  I showed a couple other ideas.  I like k4 best.]

(;W[ee];B[ff];W[fe];B[hd]C[I think the game essentially went badly wrong here for me.  Too focused on the left, I let him get too strong on top.
---
Yes, I agree.  Let's consider black's move here.  It goes against the proverb "play away from thickness".  It is very close to white's strong group, and it cannot connect to black's own strong group.  It's too early in the game with many big moves to consider to play this just to reduce.]
;W[ge]C[This move is good, do not allow h16 to connect with blacks strong group.]

(;B[gf]C[Black strengthens the strong group?  Why not strenghten the weak group?!]
;W[he]C[Ouch, h16 got hurt bad.];B[id]C[Black makes h16 so heavy!]

(;W[hf]C[White should concentrate on the j16 stones.];B[gg]
C[Again, j16 is the weak group.  Ok, point is made, will not comment on it again.]
;W[hg];B[ei];W[ej]C[Yes, defend this wall.  White is very happy for e11/e10 trade!]
;B[fi];W[fj]C[f10 also a big point, black turning here would hurt the strength of white's wall.]
;B[ld]C[Ok, after diversion, black defends.  Hard to attack these stones now.  Instead, black is making a large territory on the top.]

(;W[gd]C[These next several moves are way too small to play right now.  Also, locally white can play g17.]
;B[gc];W[fc];B[gb];W[fb];B[fa];W[ea];B[ga];W[eb];B[ib]C[Black should just a little more imagination in defending, k17 for example.]
;W[gi]C[White seals black in.  If you can seal the group in one move, it's usually a good idea.]
;B[gh]
(;W[jj]C[White is plenty strong enough here to play h12 instead.  K10 is vague, what does it do?]
;B[hi];W[gj];B[hh]C[Black got out, and now he has the chance to erase white's moyo by playing k3.  Then k10 does nothing for white.]
;W[hj];B[jh]C[Lucky, black does not play k3.];W[jp]C[Good.  White back on track now!]
;B[fq]C[Ok, so black invaded your moyo.  No problem, it was not territory yet.  Now white should expect to force black to live small, and convert part of moyo to territory.]
;W[eq];B[fp]
(;W[hq]C[This move shows white intends to go all out for kill.  I don't think white needs to play that way here.  Also, I don't think it's possible.]
;B[ep];W[dq];B[hr];W[ir];B[gr];W[er]C[Should I have been able to kill the black group in the lower left, given the white wall on row 10?
-----
Probably not.];B[hp];W[iq];B[io];W[jo]
(;B[in]C[Black's style is too solid.  When invading, black should play lightly, not caring if cutting points are created.  If white cuts, black gets a target to counter-attack.]
;W[jn];B[im];W[jm]
(;B[eo];W[gm];B[gn];W[hm];B[hn];W[fn]C[Now black should play the f7 cut and j8 push as soon as possible.]

(;B[gq]
(;W[go]C[g5 is vital, but not until black plays f5.];B[fo]
(;W[do];B[il];W[jl];B[fm];W[gl];B[em];W[en]C[Doesn't work, you found.]
;B[dn];W[en];B[dm]C[Ok, black made life.  We should have expected this from the beginning, so white lost a lot by going all out for the kill instead of defending the left side.  On the good side, white did get a big wall on the k line.]
;W[ik];B[bm];W[bo];B[bn];W[co];B[cn]C[gote.  white gets a chance.]
;W[qj]C[Good splitting move.];B[qm];W[qf];B[oc]
