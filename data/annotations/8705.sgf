AB[cc][gg]C[Throughout this game, I will tell you where I think I should have played instead. Please tell me if I am right or wrong.

Please tell me if I should give more information and questions on my next submissions.

I would also appreciate advice on the best way to review my own games on myself because I don't feel like I accomplish much when reviewing by myself.

Thank you very much!
~~Hi I'm Riani and I'll be reviewing this game for you. (I do have to warn you it's my first review so i might have been a bit blunt.) 
I'm somewhere in the 12-9 k range and play on KGS as Riani. This is my Please feel free to ask me any questions or send me an email any time :)
~~~OVerall I feel you need to work on three things: aggressiveness, cutign off what the opponent gives to you, and knowing when to play and when not to play a move. The first is easier to see on larger boards, but is especailly importaint against handicap. I give you an example of when to cut off later in this game. The last part is the most difficult, and just comes with practice. Overall a well played game :) Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.]

(;W[gc]C[I should have played f6 instead. Am I right?
~~This is a matter of style. On small boards like this, secure territory is often preferable, (like what you played here) but f16 is also a good choice.]
;B[de]
(;W[ec]C[I should have played d7.
Or should I have taken the bottom left corner?
~~D7 takes only a little bit more territory, and less securely too. I agree with you that the lower left is important. C3 would be my recommendation.]
;B[ch]C[Black has effectively shut you off from the right side with this move.]
;W[ge]C[I think I should have g4, or would f4 be more influencial?
~~g4 would be too close to an opponents stone (Touching helps the solo stone, always.) f 4 certainly has a bit more fight to it, and as white that's what I'd choose. As white in a handicap game, you MUST atttack. Calm defensive moves will rarely (if ever) win you a game.]
;B[db];W[dd]C[I didn't know if I should have played d7 or d6 but I thought d6 would lead me to more territory.
~~This move forces black to respond unlike d7, so this is better.]
;B[cd];W[ee]C[I cannot think of a better move right now. I was trying to secure the space around e7, g7, e5, and g5. I feel there is a better move though.
~~While there may be more attractive points on the board (ie f4, h3) This one is urgent, and must be played now. Good eye :)]
;B[df];W[ef]C[Again, please tell me if there is a better move.
~~this is a solid continuation from your last move. It aims to attack the lower portion and does so very well. But also notice how it helps black defend the right side..]
;B[eg]
(;W[ff]C[I think that playing at f3 was a better idea after playing out some possible sequences.
~~I agree. i included a few sequences that came to mind on that variation.]
;B[fg];W[gf]C[Is it good that I secured the shape or should I have done tenuki?]
;B[hg];W[hf]C[no questions on this one :)];B[fb];W[eb]C[Here I was trying to cut off the black stones.]
;B[gb]
(;W[fc]C[Was h8 a better idea?
~~ H8 exerts no real pressure. Better to cut the stones off outright, although h8 may become a goodpoint to hold for the L&D struggle that will come after. E8 is indeed better. Take what the opponent gives freely.. But watch every move for a trap!]
;B[hb]C[However, now would be a bad tiem to cut them off since they live easily.]
(;W[hc];B[fd];W[dc];B[cb]
(;W[ib]C[It's safe to cut them off now. Black gets away easily with E8 and all your efforts would have been wasted.]
;B[gd];W[hd];B[fa];W[ea]C[Good! you finally cut off the invading stones.]
;B[ha];W[ic]C[I would call this a wasted move. if black plays j9 then just take him at g*9. Save yourself a point. Don't play this.]
;B[ie];W[if]C[Good! taking advantage of an opponents mistakes is one of the best ways to become strong.]
;B[ig];W[ia]C[Again a wasted move. J9 and G9 are equal moves, and he can't kill you anyways. Save yourself a point. Find somewhere else to play or pass.]

This would be the best path for black, but your variation is just as likely. it depends on how aggressive black is feeling.]

Touching only helps weak stones, and with a handicap, you can't afford to help him, I demonstrated a few of these in the varations.]
