;B[qd];W[ed];B[oc];W[qo];B[cq]C[oc: until here the fuseki looks a bit experimental but only a few moves later all looks common again :)

tibia: I agree :)];W[pq];B[qj]C[oc: there are other possible moves as C16 or L3. I choosed this because you naturally would play at K17 now and than i get L3 either.]
;W[jc];B[kq];W[cn];B[fp];W[dk];B[ci];W[di]C[tibia: probably C10 is better

Semelis : I don't think so. There is a basic concept of go forgoten here:
Corners - Sides - Center : 2nd move in a corner ( shimari or kakari ) is
as valuable as 1rst move in a side, and so on.
So black C11 would be better at C16 and for W D11 I would prefer still C16.
W C10 now provoking B D11 wouldlet white with 2 cares: the upper left corner
and the left weak wroup, while black would have no problems then to settle
his 2 stones.];B[dh];W[cj];B[ei];W[dj];B[eh]C[For black E12 I still prefer C16 in theory, but I would play E12 myself
probably :-)];W[cd];B[bi]C[When coming to atack a group there are usually three steps: Cut, Surround, Kill
Looks like black is trying to kill before surrounding, and white scaping will endanger
the black stones.]
(;W[bj]C[tibia: I think that the move you chose in the game is better than the one in the variation

semelis : instead of B10 threatening the cut see variation ...]

(;B[nq]
(;W[mc]C[tibia: I think I have to play R8
oc: i don´t think so :). Sure, i think, my move atO3 looks bigger than your move at N17 because of the direction of the shimaris, but i think, the keypoint in the game are the stones on the left.

semelis : I agree.

tibia: yes, but now you can play R7 in sente: why didn't you ? :)
oc: good question, may be because i am not a Dan :) i was focused on my stones on the left, so was not able to look at the whole board.


semelis : black R7 will make white play P5, but this could also be a very
good point for black, depending of what happens at the left, I think it's
better not to decide here and see what happens at the left side first.]
;B[id]C[oc: i felt, that i should not allow any kind of white influence here because my stones around E12. Another possibility was R7.

tibia: nice move

semelis : another possiblity is B F9, if white takes gote to capture at C12 then
P5 becames a better point than R7, in fact, if you are happpy with white playing
R8, you should provoke it !  If after the black F9 (maybe something) white C12 exchange black has become
strong enough, G17 looks also intyeresting. The problem wiith J16 is that
white is not always kind enough to answer peacefully ... see variations]

(;W[ic]C[tibia: probably k16 is better];B[hd]
(;W[gc]C[oc: in my oppinion a little bit to sharp

tibia: yes, it seems a mistake

semelis : L15 is what I would play, but I don't know whether it's better
than connecting underneth or not .];B[hc]C[oc: now i think it would be wise to play in the center first. If you reinforce your weakness on the top, i got an extra move, if not, the played sequence is still possible but i am a bit more secure against any kind of splitting attack.

semelis : I agree.];W[hb];B[gb];W[fb];B[gd];W[fc];B[ib];W[ga]
;B[kc]C[tibia: I have overlooked this :)];W[jd];B[jb];W[kd]
;B[lc];W[ld];B[mb];W[md];B[nb];W[ff]C[semelis : another possiblity is H14, the vital point of the 3-stones line, at
this point black can think of sacrificing the left stones if he can catch the
white's cuted in the upper side.];B[if];W[kg];B[ih];W[hg];B[ig]
;W[gh]C[tibia: I think it should have been H12
oc: i would give away the whole left side, if i get the whole right for it :)

semelis : ditto.  N13 for white looks better, strengthening this group reduces
black right side and the left group will still be weak.];B[gi]
;W[fh];B[fi];W[hf]C[tibia: horrible, but it is already too late

semelis : tenuki then ?];B[hh];W[fd];B[ie];W[ql]C[oc: may be not good, because it provokes my next move, wich both strengthens my side territory and weakens your center stones.

semelis : I agree, N13 or M12 look safe, M13, trying to keep the presure on
black's weak group also is apealing.];B[pg]C[semelis : too tight !, L11 is better, the points losed by forcing white to go  to the right will be recovered at the lower side as black becomes stronger
in the center.];W[oe]C[semelis : not the right direction, L11 seems better now that the right
side is almost closed.];B[ng];W[lh];B[mf];W[lf]
(;B[ij];W[me];B[qe];W[pi]C[tibia: I think this should be K4 (I was afraid for my centre group)
oc: i think after N15 the center group is virtualy alife

semelis : only virtually, I think Q11 is too dangerous and black can think of
a counter attack ( N13 + N11, e.i. )];B[qi];W[gl]C[semelis : I think that the lower side is a better place to play.
or still M10. I'm worried about the white group there.];B[il]
;W[hk];B[ik];W[hj];B[hl];W[gk];B[hi];W[ji]C[semelis : geting this en sente feels very good for white.]
;B[ii]C[semelis : now];W[gn];B[hp]C[tibia: this exchange is too bad for me. The game is over

semelis : of course after balck gets H8 and J8 it's difficult to enter the lower side,
maybe instead of G6, b G4 w G3 b H3 would be better];W[ho];B[ip]
C[oc: with this move i statet: "If the center-group lives (and i think it is able to do), then i will win on territory"

semelis : it should live];W[jn];B[cf]C[oc: this should save me one eye in sente.

semelis : B13 is usually better shape];W[be];B[bf];W[ai];B[bh]
;W[ef]C[oc: nice move, if i get an eye here, then only in gote.]
;B[jm];W[kn];B[km];W[ln];B[in];W[io];B[kk];W[jp];B[jq];W[dp]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[eq];W[fo];B[gp];W[cp];B[pl];W[qm];B[ne]C[semelis : yose is not my stron point but instead of O15 N11 looks promising.]
;W[mg];B[nf];W[nh];B[oh];W[ni];B[mi]C[semelis : doesn't work well]
;W[mj];B[li];W[lj];B[ki];W[kj];B[jh];W[kh];B[jj];W[nj]C[semelis :  white has now 2 secure eyes and thickness]
;B[ah];W[ll];B[kl]C[oc: at this stage i played back the game on a real goban at home and was counting again. It was a surprise for me how close the game was again and with your sente i thought, that i would loose it. You got a lot of territory (more than i expected) on the left and i got not as much on the right.  For the future i expected, that you will play the big sente-move at P2.

tibia: I thought I was behind, but of course yose it is not my strong point :)

Black: 40 upper right, 30/35 lower side and centre
oc: 36 upper right, 28 lower side and center

White: 20 upper left, 20 left side, 30 lower right, centre and komi, plus some potential in the centre
oc: 18 upper left, 18 left side, 24 lower right, center and komi
seems i count a bit more conservative, but with nearly the same result in the difference
It seems close :), but the point is, you own sente :)]
(;W[np]C[tibia: this seems not the best move :)

semelis : Q9, L9 and L7 are 3 points from where black can make all this
neutral points.];B[mp];W[no];B[or]C[semelis : it's hard to tell whether Q9 is bigger or not.]
;W[oq];B[mr];W[pj];B[qr];W[qq];B[rr];W[pr];B[ps];W[rq];B[bq]
C[semelis : Black gets to play both corners and and all the sente moves from now.]
;W[qk];B[qh];W[bp];B[ap];W[ao];B[aq];W[bn];B[sr]
(;W[sq]C[semelis : here white could take sente, playing S10 or M7 is bigger than the 3
points T3 protects. At least play all the sente moves that threaten more than
T1 does before playing T3];B[lm];W[mm];B[fk];W[fl];B[ek];W[el]
;B[ce];W[bd];B[rk]C[semelis : enormous. If hane and connection at 1rst line is big, just imaging
at 2nd line! No, better still: count it.
T3 was the last white move before the long sequence of black sente
moves, it should be at S10, black gets the same sequence after S11-white
connects, then black T3 white S4 black T4 white T5 and white is 3 or 4
points better off. See variation before.];W[rl];B[rj];W[nd]
;B[od];W[ia];B[kb];W[mo];B[lp];W[lk]C[semelis :  finally white gets about 15 points capturing Q8, but looses
10 in the corner while black gets 7 points there. Seems the corner was
bigger.
But white has been able to play N5 and M9 because of black S9.]
;B[aj];W[ak];B[ge]C[semelis :  looks like black wins by 10 points]
)
(;W[rj];B[ri];W[rk];B[sq];W[rp];B[sp];W[so]C[After that black can play the same sente moves than in the game, then
he can't take the big gote at S9, so would have to play something else:
it has sente, but it's not so valuable as S9]))
(;W[or];B[nr];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[rk];W[pj];B[no];W[on]C[oc: this way i count you about 2 points ahead.

tibia: also with the monkey jump on the right ?
oc: i would only take the small monkey jump to T7, because T6 would be gote :)

semelis : I think white is about 4 points ahead ;-)]))
(;B[ne]C[oc: i also considered this attack, but was afraid of the cut at H10

semelis : I agree. cuting at O15 is just a yose move. The center is still too
unstable to think about yose now.]))
(;W[gb];B[hg];W[ql]C[semelis : white's beeing too submissive: doing something on the lower
side before black locks it whit J4 seems urgent.
K4, K3, H3, G4: all look possible.];B[oj]C[oc: that should be the normal and peaceful way

semelis : maybe *too* peaceful: now that black is stronger
at the center-left, P10 really shines !]))
(;W[jd];B[ie]
(;W[hb];B[je]C[semelis : this seems too good for black. K16 is standard nad H18 too, but
there are other possibilities.])
(;W[kf]C[semelis : white is laying the grounds for an invasion at the right]
))
(;W[if]C[semelis : white counter-attacks strongly, of course also looking
at the weak stones.]))
(;W[ql];B[oj]C[oc: i would be glad to ake this move as it helpsmy left stones too, while building a kind of moyo on the right.

semelis : White has a followup at P12, and any kind of fight can harm black's left group]
))
(;B[lc]C[oc: this would give me a kind of double-wing-formation, but on the other hand it provokes ..]
;W[je]C[oc: ..which i didn´t want because of the weakness of my E12-group

semelis : But you have sente now to mend it. Any other gote move
as the played O3 would let white play at K15, so the question is: this gote
move where is it? at O3 you have later sente moves agains the corner,
at M17 you are supporting H17 or H15.  Maybe reinforcing the black left stones at once should be better.]
))
(;W[cg];B[ch]
(;W[fk]C[semelis : looks like white is atacking strongly, but ....]
;B[bg]C[semelis : ... now black is virtually alive.])
(;W[bg];B[hh];W[fn]C[semelis : I think it's playable, but very complicated: black's better off at the
right side, but the incomeing fight might end inside his moyo, the
left group is neither that strong, and still the center group is eyeless.
But to exploit all this by white is very difficult.])))
