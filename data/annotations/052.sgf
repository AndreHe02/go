KM[0.5];B[pd];W[op];B[dc];W[do];B[qp];W[qq]C[White plays 5-4 when he wants to fight.  The fighting here is Q6,
making a nice wall, or starting a big fight.];B[ce]C[This is very big, so ignoring thelower right is OK.]
;W[nc];B[pf]C[This is a little slow.  You have

an opportunity to pincer and
extend from the upper left,
perhaps to K16.];W[kd];B[hd]C[J17 is another alternative.
It puts more pressure on
the white stones, so white
is more likely to answer,
and you can keep sente.];W[qh];B[pj];W[oh];B[me];W[md];B[ng];W[ni];B[nk]
C[this move doesn't surround white yet, and starts a wall facing
a white position, so perhaps just
extending at Q7 would be better.

Or you could finish the joseki
in the lower right, perhaps
with S3, Q3, R6.];W[ql]C[good move.  White gets a big
corner.];B[pl];W[qm];B[qk];W[pp];B[mh]C[This move doesn't do much.
Forcing white out here only
weakens the black group below.

Much bigger to extend on the  left side, making a double wing formation,
or play around D3 or E3.];W[mj];B[mk];W[lj];B[le];W[ke];B[lk];W[kj]C[If B is thinking about  making a double wing in the upperleft,
and expanding it into the center,
he will not be pushing W toward
his potential territory.  Later he might want to attack from
the left instead to expand that
upper left.];B[pm];W[qo];B[qn]C[Good move.  reduces white in
sente.];W[rn];B[pn];W[rp];B[eq];W[cq]C[Since W is strong on right,
consider playing from other
side and giving up the
corner.  How about H3,
C3, L4/M4.];B[hp]C[Since W is strong, it
would be better to just
extend to H3, making a more
solid shape.];W[kq]C[Again an extension to
K3 puts more pressure on the B
stones.];B[lp];W[lq];B[np];W[nq]C[
 hilt 9k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[mq];W[no]C[Why not just play N3, N4,
O2?  W gets more territory
on the edge.  In the game
the stone at O5 gets captured
and B gets the center terr anyway
The center is no so big.];B[mp]C[
 ckm 8k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[kp];B[ko];W[jo];B[kn];W[ip];B[mr]C[Now white's terr is reduced
a lot, and W gets a weak group.
And the B stones at L5/L6 help
surround the center.];W[ho];B[eo]C[B could play at H3 now,
getting some eye space.

Better to just live here
since running out will give W
territory on the left side.];W[gp];B[hq]C[Now would be a great time
to curl around W at D6 since
he ignored your attachment.
W won't waste a move at H3 to capture one stone,
so you can always pull it out later.

Playing at D6 could give you a
large territory on the left side.];W[gq];B[hr]C[If you want to save these, try
playing at J2.  This threatens
to connect to the right with K1
(not L1, which can be cut),
or to play G2, connecting to
the left.];W[gr];B[js]C[This move does not connect.
Most pairs of knight's moves
on the edge can be cut by  sacrificing in one to
cut the other.

For example, WM1,m2,l2,
L1,J1,K2,J2,K3,K4,N1,
J3 captures 3 stones with sente.

Or WL1,L2,K2,M1,J1 Ko.];W[ir]C[This helps black connect.

How about WK2, L1,J1,
J2,M1 to capture lots
of B stones.

The key is to sacrifice one
stone on one side to cut the
other.  Keep reading till you
find one that works.  There
are several here.];B[is]C[Now is still not too late to
play D6.  Turning here is
bigger than saving 3 stones
with gote (only 6 points!).];W[iq];B[hs]C[
 hilt 9k*:  hope this works...];W[ks];B[kr];W[lr];B[ls];W[fo];B[en];W[jn]
;B[km];W[jr];B[ks];W[dp];B[ep];W[dm]C[B has a very weak group here.
W gets territory on the
left while attacking.  W
takes the lead here.];B[fn];W[gn];B[fl];W[ck]C[Consider playing this at
D9, taking more territory,
and threatening F10 as
a followup, or extending
to C12, for even more
territory.];B[jm]C[W is alive already, so you
should be concerned about
strengthening you left group.
How about B G7, W H7, B H8,
W J7, B J8 to save your
group and keep W cut from his right side group.];W[im];B[in]C[This cut is not so good.
Playing on the outside is  better at J8, or how about
K9 first, then W K10,
B J8, W H7, B G9 and you
are connected.  If W
doesn't connect to the top,
you can cut around L13,
and if W does connect, you
get the last big point at C12.];W[hm];B[ek];W[kk];B[jk]C[This move helps W connect to
the top, and doesn't connect
to your own stones anyway,
leaving a cut at K8.  You
could just jump in the center
to E11, or attach at C10,
B10, B9, B8, B11, A9, D10.
or D10, C10, D12, planning
to take a big center by
attacking the rigt side W
group.];W[jj];B[ik];W[ij]C[
 hilt 9k*: has entering byo-yomi again];B[hk];W[jg];B[jh]C[
 ckm 8k*: has entering byo-yomi again

W is connecting across dame,
so now is a good time to take
sente and get the big point on the left side.

This fight gains B nothing and ends in gote.  If you leave W thin

here, he won't be able to invade after B C12.  You could even
try B C10 and crosscut.];W[kh];B[kg];W[ih];B[lh]C[better to play K14 instead,
then connect at L14 to
cut white apart.];W[ji];B[kf];W[ne];B[jf]C[But you get to cut anyway.];W
[if];B[je]C[Your cut has made W thick in
the center, making it harder
for you to expand your upper left corner.];W[pb];B[ld]C[usually you shouldn't push like
this if you don't intend to cut.

It fills one of your own  liberties, and strengthens
W, so save it until you are
ready to cut.];W[lc];B[qc];W[qe];B[pe]C[you could try B P16, W O16,
B P 14, W S14, to connect
out with sente.  Then you
can play L17 or C12 to win.

This move ends in gote.];W[qf];B[pg];W[ph];B[nf];W[jd];B[ie];W[ch]C[W gets the last big extension.
This move is worth over 15
points.  It should have been
played earlier.];B[ri]C[This move strengthens white,
and gains you little.  Better
not to play it.

You are alive, and there are
much bigger endgame points,
like P5.

You could even play R13, S13,
S12, S11, S14, T12, S15,  capturing 2 stones.  This
capture is gote so it is way too
early for it now, but you
shouldn't eliminate the possibility.];W[rh];B[qg]C[Again, don't push unless you plan to cut. This is a bad
habit.  This point will be here
later.  There are many bigger moves.];W[rg];B[rd]C[This move is way too small,
and gote.  J17, P5, G14, are
all bigger.];W[ic];B[hf]C[This move is pretty small.
You should answer at H17 or
W can take a lot of your territory away.

This only threatens to capture
1 stone.];W[gj];B[hj];W[hi];B[gk];W[gi];B[ig];W[ei]C[You used two moves to capture
a single stone, and forced W
to surround your lower group.

Not good.];B[hc];W[jl]C[Now B is in trouble below.
But he defends very well.

In the end W ends in Gote,
so this attack loses points.

If you must attack a group,
be sure it lives in gote.

The attacker should only
end in gote when the group
dies.];B[dq];W[cr]C[W C4 would put up a stronger
defense.];B[dn];W[cn];B[co]C[Good cut. Pushing is fine if
you plan to cut.];W[cp]C[
 hilt 9k*: has entering byo-yomi again];B[cm];W[bo];B[dl]C[
 ckm 8k*: has entering byo-yomi again];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl];B[dk];W[em]C[Now would be a good time for
W to play C10, B E7, and W ends
in sente, having taken some
territory in the corner.];B[gm];W[hl];B[kl];W[il];B[gl]C[This move is not needed and
should be saved for a ko
threat.];W[hn];B[ej]C[You try C10 first, and take
some points away from white.];W[cj];B[fj];W[fi];B[oo]C[Very big.  B played well,
living in sente, and
taking a good endgame point.];W[ee]C[A little bit too deep.  When
reducing, look for the line
between the stones defining
the edges of the territory
(C15 and H14/J13).  To
reduce, stay on or outside this
line.  If you play inside it,
you must be prepared to get cut
off and be able to live or counterattack.

Reduce at E14 or F14 (on the
line).];B[eg]C[having just said that, in this
case, W is thick, so the W move
is probably OK.  W should be
able to save his invasion  with D14, D13, C14, C13, B13.

Or W could play C14, D14, B15,
and try to connect around and  take the corner, giving up the
stone in the center in
exchange for the corner.];W[dg];B[df];W[eh];B[ef]C[B can play F13 now and take
a big territory.  This should be

enough to win.  E14 is safer
though, and almost as big.];W[ib];B[hb];W[ha];B[ga];W[ia];B[fb];W[fg];B
[qb]C[F14 is pretty big, since you
will get C13 and B13 and A12
in sente later, as well as G13.

This is at least 18 points,
much bigger than the upper
right corner.];W[ff];B[fe];W[cf];B[de];W[ge];B[fd];W[bf];B[be];W[ob]C[W should take A15 now since
it is double sente.];B[nj];W[mi];B[oi];W[nh];B[id];W[jc]C[
 hilt 9k*: has entering byo-yomi again];B[oq]C[This is not so big.
A monkey jump to Q1 is bigger.

W can answer P2, O2, Q2 and
you don't get much.

But first, both sides should
be trying to get the double
sente at A14/A15.  W can take  it now.];W[pq]C[W should take A15 first,
gaining 4 points.];B[or]C[
 ckm 8k*: has entering byo-yomi again];W[pr];B[re];W[rf];B[af];W[ag];B[ae]
;W[bh];B[rl]C[This would be better at S9,
also sente, and saving S11 at thesame time.];W[rm];B[gf];W[os];B[nr];W[rj]
