C[[L\] Hello. My comments will have this [L\] in front of them. I'm sorry, but my german lang skill is very poor, so I'll have to stick to english.

Dear reviewer,
I am Peter, (KGS: azahar1), German, in case you speak german.
Thanks for helping me to improve!

Generally I am still looking for an over all strategie.
I have tried to put some comments, to make life easier on you...

With kind regards,
Peter];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[ec];W[df];B[hd];W[qf]
(;B[qe]TR[pj][qj][qk][pk]C[[L\] Not the ideal joseki in my opinion. This is usualy used, when there is a black stone around marked areas. See possible variations.]
(;W[qh]C[[L\] weak response - Q14 is the only reasonable choice i think]
;B[qk];W[po]
(;B[qp]C[[L\] I'm not so sure about this move - pincer would propably be better, since it makes your R9 stronger]
;W[qm];B[ok];W[oh]
(;B[jp]C[[L\] - too far - better to keep some pressure on the W group]
;W[fq];B[hq]C[P: should I better have played D10 or C12 ?

[L\] for invasion C9 would be better i think];W[mp];B[mq];W[nq]
;B[lq]C[P: the idea was to keep lower side alive];W[op];B[oq]
;W[lp];B[nr]C[P: Too small? D 10? Always have the problem: defending-expanding/atacking...

[L\] I think you got lucky he let you connect both sides so easily - this move is good i think]
;W[np];B[kp]TR[ok][qk]C[[L\] this might be too small. I would prefer to run with marked group]
;W[ln]
(;B[om]C[P: to prevent W from getting nice Moyo there and to have some way into the center.

[L\] you can easily prevent moyo by playing N9]
(;W[pm]C[[L\] weak move - I think that Q8 is a better move]
;B[pl];W[dj]C[P: Now W is there instead of B ...]
(;B[md]C[[L\] maybe better to keep high-low balance on top (check variations)
you can also still invade lower left];W[jd];B[jc];W[kc];B[ic]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[ke];B[ie];W[kg]
(;B[nf]C[[L\] this feels like an undecisive move in middle of two good ones (check var)]
;W[of];B[oe];W[me];B[ne]C[P: Plan was to protect corner and separate W + move towards center

[L\] While moving towards center, you're only making your group on Q8 weaker - better to move it to center]

;B[kk];W[qj];B[pj];W[pi];B[oj];W[oi];B[ql];W[on];B[nm];W[nn]
(;B[ml]TR[bp][dm]C[[L\] no need to let him make nice shapes and no need to play this move - there are much bigger moves on the board
 even if he plays here later on, you can easily survive - check var]
;W[mm];B[nk]C[P: was afraid of W O8];W[jn];B[ko]C[[L\] very small move and it makes possible invasion on left harder and harder]
;W[jl];B[io];W[dm]C[[L\] Now the game is finnished];B[fe]TR[cb]
[kh]C[[L\] small - better to play elsewhere];W[ed];B[fd];W[dc]
;B[db];W[eb];B[fc];W[cb];B[ee];W[dd];B[fb];W[da];B[jf];W[kf]
;B[rm];W[jg];B[ig];W[je];B[if];W[ji];B[ih];W[gg];B[fg];W[gh]
;B[fh];W[hi];B[kj]C[P: In that phase I was definitely not sure which way to go, too many options.
    What would you have done?

[L\] At this point D12 seems like a reasonable point];W[ki]
;B[lh];W[mg];B[nh];W[li];B[eg]C[P: or betterD12 / D13 ? Or...? (Lack of experience...)

[L\] D12 - no way to cut it and it takes more points away from W]

C[[L\] I'll never understand wha W didn't defended here, when he still could. But that's only good for you :)]

(;B[lf]C[P: Again -- what is better?

[L\] there's no need to play this now, there are bigger points - see var]
;W[le];B[lg];W[hf];B[ge];W[he];B[hg];W[gf];B[id];W[fa];B[ga]
;W[ea];B[ia];W[aj];B[cq]C[P: Good idea? Invasion is also something I fight with...

[L\] definitely not - in next few moves, W let's you take a lot of points, he didn't realy had to let go - i can see no way for B to survive and escape here, if defended well. On lower kyuu level you might get away with this, but later on, there's no chance to succeed. Not in this situation anyway, though there will be sometimes games, where it will be possible due to some decent tesuji.]

;W[fk];B[sn]C[P: Better M5?  Or R17 ? T9... Timid...

[L\] one thing's for sure - this move is absolutely unnecesary, so everything is better.]
;W[lo];B[pp];W[sl];B[sm];W[sk];B[kl];W[qc]C[P: Here I lost the game, because I messed it up.
    How do you answer this R17 ? Standard answer?

[L\] simple - just play S 16 and wait for his next more - rest can be solves using some basic tsumego solving skills]
;B[rc];W[rd];B[sd];W[rb];B[sc];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[pa]
;B[sb];W[ra]C[P: R18 !!! and I did not do it !

[L\] indeed]
(;B[qd];W[qb];B[oa]C[P: thought of a Ko, but....

[L\] good thinking. Though it was unnecesary to be in this position, now this is the only chance - however, looking at the board, it seems you dan't have enough threats to win this ko]
;W[na];B[ri]C[[L\] way too small threat - playing C19 would at least give you some points back (and won the game in this case) - if he would ignore - if not, he still had some very big threats unfortunatelly (G2, H1)]

    Thanks again for having a look at the game!

[L\] thanks for having me take a look :)
     I would suggest to you to train more tesuji and other tsumego problems, especially life and death - don't realy bother with overall strategies for beginning and try to solve at least 50 or more problems every day you can - it helps more than you would believe - in few weeks or monhts , you will notice your strength growing and on higher levels, you can start getting concerned about overall tactics and josekies.]

C[[L\] keeping sente is very important - always check, if you have some moves, that let's you do it - properly played end game moves can give you about 10 points (sometimes even more)]
