C[[Malweth\]: I think you played an excellent game - paying more attention to tsumego and solid play would have certainly won you the game.

If you have any other questions or comments, please e-mail me. You may also direct them to http://www.godiscussions.com - it's a community of helpful players.

==
In this game, which was played on KGS, I was black (15k), and darkaries 14k took white.

My go experience has been mostly 9x9 and 13x13, which i have played for years, intimidated by the larger board.  last year i found a local club of other go players and found myself flung into the larger context of big board play, and i really love it!  since then i have read some books but the about 60 games online/with humans and two AGA tournaments is my experience with 19x19 fuseki.

During the course of this game, white more or less accuses black of playing rudely and at one point even 'cheating.'  As i was not aware that there was such a thing as cheating or 'rude play' on a Go board, but further research at sensei's library showed that there is such a thing as 'vulgar play.'  This game has been weighing heavily at my mind for these reasons, which is why I have chosen it to be reviewed.  Please if you have any suggestions about "proper play" allow them to be at the foremost of your mind.  I would like to develop early game strategy as well, but not at all until I won't anger someone who is trying to have fun playing a game : ).]

[qi][ri][si][jj][kj][lj][mj][nj][oj][pj][qj][sj]C[[Malweth\]: As a general point of interest, it's good form to play in the Upper Right where I've marked. All other points are symmetrical.

This is not a requirement, but is a standard way to begin the game.]
;W[pd]C[brett1138 [15k\]: hello
brett1138 [15k\]: gl :)];B[dc]C[[Malweth\]: This is ok. It's harder for your two stones to work together when they're diagonally opposite, but it is still a popular way to begin.

==
Since I am used to a smaller board, I find it to my advantage to break the game up into smaller sides.  I began this here.]
;W[dp];B[ce]TR[jd]SQ[pj][jp]C[[Malweth\]: This seems like a good plan :) Instead of K4 or Q10, I would look towards the approach moves at R14 and F3. They are (nearly) sente and very big.
==
with the corner formation i aimed at k16 and decided that i would be satisfied with k4 or q10 if white extended out... k16 is still a very large shape for me.]
;W[jj]C[[Malweth\]: There is no moyo in the upper left! The upper left *corner* represents solid territory, but a moyo will be hard to create (especially not a large one). If you were looking for a moyo game, you should have played in the lower left first to attempt to work with your lower right stone.
==
I don't understand the center play here, but it did frustrate the potential moyo i worked for at upper left.  in retrospect... maybe k17 or even j17 to respond?]
;B[jd]C[[Malweth\]: This move is still good... it makes K10 hard to use.

Based on your opponent's future comments, he thinks the K10 will help him escape toward the center... really there's not much need for this.]
;W[gd]C[[Malweth\]: The way you end up playing is commendable. Keep things simple when your opponent tries to complicate the game! This will nearly ALWAYS work in your favor!

==
i am used to games corners and extensions happen before invasions.  it makes sense though, now i have to decide between tenuki and addressing the situation.]
;B[nc]C[[Malweth\]: Yes, good! Practically sente.

==
the move i decided on was to strengthen the extension stone, approach the corner, and therefore put a lot of pressure on g16.]
;W[pc]C[[Malweth\]: This move is asking to invade around M17. Your response is good...]
;B[nd]C[[Malweth\]: Yes, it is good!

To place more pressure on G16, you could also think about K17!
==
I was tremendously satisfied with this result, although I still had no idea how to approach g16.

Can you suggest a move here that takes advantage of white's seemingly slow play at q16?]
;W[pf];B[jp]C[[Malweth\]: F3 is good too, but holding back to here can help now because of the K10 stone...]
;W[mp]C[==
White loves to invade.  I didn't have any idea how to respond to this, so i went with something familiar.]
;B[fq]C[[Malweth\]: And your response is still good!];W[dn]
;B[dr]C[[Malweth\]: This move isn't so good. K4 is far away so the W invasion is good.

Think about F5? Hard to say what's best here... but you need to emphasize the extension.]
;W[hp]C[==
invaded again, and somewhat devastatingly this time.  at this point in a game like this i feel like k4 is just toast.]
;B[hq]C[==
maybe i should've left it alone.];W[gq]C[[Malweth\]: This works well because you can't save both K4 AND D2.

The best defense is perhaps G2.]
(;B[gp];W[iq];B[gr]C[[Malweth\]: A bit overconcentrated and the loss of K4 is bad.
==
ponnuki seemed good...];W[ip]C[==
oops, k4 in a real bind now];B[jq]C[still testing what white's strengths and weaknesses are ... wondering about j2]
;W[ir];B[in]C[[Malweth\]: Grudge against invaders, probably :) It's often hard to tell what is an overplay, but the typical instinct is that an invader is an overplay... this is because when you had weaker fighting skills your invaders tended to die. (This will still tend to be true when your fighting strength is weaker than your opponent's).

In this case, W's invasion is good... the only question would be of timing -- the D4 group isn't settled yet.
==
probably hasty.  in retrospect i'm thinking r9 is a great place to be instead, maybe i either i have a grudge against invading stones, or hold on too tight to initial plays.]
;W[hn];B[ho];W[io];B[go];W[jn];B[im];W[jo];B[gm]C[[Malweth\]: Looks like a good outcome for black!

At this point it's good to take notice of the entire board. the D4 stones are attackable because of your thickness, and the Q4 stone is weakened because of W's thickness.

==
at this point i thought maybe i had done something good, coming into the center,  and fighting two white groups.]
;W[jm]
(;B[dl]TR[he]LB[co:A][cq:B][cl:C]C[[Malweth\]: Playing at J8 was necessary. These are standard moves - W is pushing against B... and B's stones can be atari'd.

After J8, K8, J9, K9 there are a few moves for B to attack the W stones, marked with letters (instead of D8). The high approach at D8 isn't as good for attacking white.
==
this was dumb.  i do remember thinking that i could build a black wall facing the g16 anvasion stone and play h15 later on... but that's probably convoluted.]
;W[em];B[el];W[fl];B[fm];W[fk]TR[ci]C[==
i probably should've built a base and get ready to connect... but now i was focused on reducing white's presence.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cn]C[[Malweth\]: Your three stones are becoming very weak... you can still escape with D10.
==
i hadn't thought of that response until my stone was already played.]
;B[cp];W[bl]
(;B[cj]C[[Malweth\]: Wrong move.
==
too late?];W[ck]
(;B[dk]C[[Malweth\]: Here there was a much better move. See variation.]

;W[il];B[di];W[cm];B[ej];W[dk]C[[Malweth\]: White needn't have even bothered connecting. It is small, W is alive!]
;B[fj];W[ij];B[gj]C[[Malweth\]: At great cost! This move (G10) peeps on two sides of a bamboo joint! This is inefficient shape.

You also failed at attacking a weak white group - this isn't too bad, because you got something for it. The next step is to use the black wall to destroy G16 by playing something around J12.
==
and so i finally got my black wall... : /];W[gg];B[ih]C[[Malweth\]: This was the best move before WG13. Now perhaps H12 is better... even though it strengthens white more.

It may still be very playable like this.

==
This was both because i wanted to hem in the white group and because now the wall, though strong, didn't seem thick enough to withstand a strong attack, i wanted to give it an outlet.]
;W[if];B[jf];W[jg];B[ig];W[je];B[kf];W[ke];B[lf];W[le];B[me]
C[[Malweth\]: Slowly you're losing your top side territory. This is usually bad... your gain is nil, but K16 is dead.]
;W[id];B[kc];W[mf];B[jh];W[ic];B[fc]TR[kc][nd]C[==
three minute time lag here, i was trying to read out the sequence involving these stones... and i think i did it, so i thought i should lift out white's base both to attack and increase territory.]

(;W[gc];B[gb];W[ib];B[hb];W[hc]C[==
i think i started to get greedy here, and maybe this is why white comments later on.  i should've left this point and around r9 is still hanging open... or even taken d13 as a large point.]
;B[he]C[==
but no, placement to kill, really just wanting to continue chase.]

darkaries [14k\]: i will show you no mercy either in that case
brett1138 [15k\]: we are both playing the same chain of moves


==
it's taken me awhile to gather an idea of what he's referring to... what's your take on it, also, i hadn't read this atari sequence... i thought he was captured.  he probably should've been, seeing that even in my own review of the game i think i figured out some mistakes i made.

once i realized that this was probably an accusation, i looked at the board and still thought it unfounded, because either of us could tenuki at any time, and he chose also to play to save his g16 invasion stone.  but i think he wanted to keep it pretty bad.  it still wound up a good game, i thought.]

(;B[df];W[ci];B[jk]C[[Malweth\]: O3 would be a big threat... you could try to use P8 too, though it seems like it was originally a nonsense move.
==
this was my attempt at making a ko threat... pretty weak probably.  any suggestion?]
;W[ch]
(;B[kk]C[==
if i had played down i think i would've been laddered into n4, but the cut would've been huge!]
;W[jl];B[kj];W[on];B[pi]C[[Malweth\]: It would have been better. You are trying to make territory in the center of the board... you're also trying to make territory from thickness. Both are bad to do.

Q4 is surrounded... At this point, R3 is a serious option (though O3 might work out for you...)
==
q8 instead?];W[pl];B[ok];W[pk]
(;B[oj];W[pj]C[[Malweth\]: Let's work out what just happened...

Black has earned about 15 points in the center (about half of which should have been his anyway).

White has earned about 9 points on the side and is about ready to make 35 more points by killing Q4.

White got a MUCH better deal!];B[qi]C[[Malweth\]: Big move, but saving Q4 is bigger.

The 4-4 point surrounds no territory on its own.];W[qq]C[[Malweth\]: Plenty... all before white played this move ;)

At this point, Q4 is dead.

;W[ko];B[ml];W[ll];B[lk];W[mo];B[qr];W[nr];B[or]C[[Malweth\]: Yes, B is totally dead in this corner. Best (local) B move is S2 (Sente), but it still shouldn't live.

==
this is all flustered in review.  i think i had already forgotten about white's bamboo connection and was trying to make semai.]
;W[rr];B[rs];W[rq]C[==
I was desparate to keep something here, though i knew it was dead.]

wasted sequence and potential ko threats though.];B[os];W[nq]
;B[lr];W[mr];B[kr]TR[fk][hk][fl][hl]C[[Malweth\]: Never play for seki... they're uncommon for a reason! Assuming the bamboo joint were cut by B... B would still need to make an EYE at L2, which is nearly impossible... and any semeai is clearly favorable by white.

==
now i'm definately thinking about seki, forgetting  the connection at g 8&9]

i do not understand what he means.  i feel like Go proceeds from the corners, to the edges, then to the center.  maybe i'm playing too safe or conservatively.  I wonder if he just didn't like how i reacted to his invasions?]

by the time i hit enter for this line of text he had already left.

white wins.  i figured he would, he seemed to have a good handle on fuseki... which i suppose doesn't say much compared to mine.  my strength is mostly in fighting and in endgame.  though that clearly didn't win the game for me.  i saw some much better choices i could have made during the game as well.
