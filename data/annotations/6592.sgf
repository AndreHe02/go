C[xxc : hi, i'm the reviewer for this game

Artigas let's a lot of comments and we can believe he works on this game righ after the end
so, i'll do the review this way :

xxc1 - give my point of view on heach comments from Artigas
xxc2 - search for one subject he failed/missed all the game
you can read it this way xxc1 first unitl the end of the comment, then xxc2 (all var applies only for xxc2)

let's go];B[qd];W[dp]C[xxc2 : i hope you understand you may read this after xxc1 :)

i show here what B needs with is first move]
(;B[pq];W[dd]LB[oc:1][pj:2][qo:A][jp:B]C[xxc2 : according previous comment we have 1&2 and A&B ... then lower left seems the target here]

(;B[qj]C[Artigas: I like to do this opening (R16, Q3), but then I don't know if it is better to play P17 or R 10.

xxc1 : what is B waiting for R16/Q3 ?
R16 is to get a chance to add P17 fast and get a strong living corner (same for Q5 with R5) and then (if possible) extend along the side facing the "shimari", Q10 (and K4 here)
first the corner ... but witch one ?
looking at both with standard path, i think you'll found both interesting, then ...]
;W[oc]C[xxc2 : both right B stones are low ... perhaps a pincer ?]

(;B[oe];W[md];B[jq]C[[Artigas\]
Here I am thinking to extend on the lower side. I also thought of attacking upper white stones, P10, or approach white corners.

xxc1: keeping  upper W group for later seems a good idea
P10 is big, but quite slow right now

perhaps E3 here ?];W[qh]
(;B[ph]C[[Artigas\]
OK, white invades, I am thinking about P12 as an alternative.

xxc1 : just pushing this stone seems ok
P10, Q11 ... from the weak group, or Q13 from the strong one (against all "rules") to get a strong  move from R10

i do not think it was a good idea to touch at Q12, W can hurt now with fight]
;W[qo];B[qm]C[[Artigas\]
I am thinking of making a base and attacking at the same time.

xxc1 : good];W[op]
(;B[pp]C[[Artigas\]
White attacks the corner, I am thinking I will make him heavy.

xxc1 : and what about a submissive move here ? P3 ?
W still not have a base and a strong group over the head];W[po]
;B[oo]C[[Artigas\]
Trying to separate white stones...];W[on];B[no];W[pm];B[nn]
C[[Artigas\]
Is this a mistake? I am thinking I will make outside influence while chasing white, but am walking into a hit on the head. Maybe I shoul attack from the other side? P8? Or maybe O3, securing capture, and then concentrate on another part of the board?

xxc1 : it seems ok, P8 no, and O3 too small
this way W still had his problem for life and B start to build a really strong and big lower side ... it's ok i think]

(;W[nm];B[pl];W[ol];B[qn];W[pn];B[pk];W[rq]LB[kc:A][cn:B]C[xxc2 : time to play elsewhere and think big i think]
;B[qp];W[ro];B[rp];W[sm];B[rl];W[sl];B[rk];W[rn]LB[kc:A][cn:B]
[fq:C]C[xxc2 : here again ... larger moves all over the board]
;B[rm];W[sn];B[sk]C[[Artigas\]
Thinking about this afterwards, it feels like an unnecessary move at this point in the game...I still want to attack the group, but unable to see how to make the most prifit out of this...and maybe I should concentrate on another part of the board at this stage.

xxc1 : righ no need to play this stone righ now
to go on with the attack ... an other question : how can white live ?

in the corner ? ... seems difficult to get 2 eyes, T4 needed and then a B move, this will let only one (possible) eye
can W cut and kill something near ? mmm, don't think so

so the way is from the outside ... B had the choice from righ or lower group, lower seems better choice, less B stones]
;W[ok]C[xxc2 : again ...];B[oj];W[mk];B[mm];W[ml];B[nk];W[nl]

(;B[mg];W[nf];B[mf];W[ne];B[lj];W[lk];B[kj]C[[Artigas\]
Now I am trying to make my way to the center...but I think I could have made much more profit on the lower side, and the battle is just happening on "my" corners...the other two corners are left alone.

xxc1 : walking for the center is for escape when there is no more chance to live ... no need here

you are right, but B gets more cash right now];W[jk];B[jj];W[jm]

(;B[dj]C[[Artigas\]
Now I am finally moving over to this side.

xxc1 : it's ok];W[dg]
(;B[dm];W[dn];B[cm];W[cn];B[ch]C[[Artigas\]
Trying to make a base...

xxc1: good, but seems too small, W gets more profit here];W[cg]
;B[bh];W[bg]
(;B[eh]C[[Artigas\]
It made sense to me at the time to move for the center...but now I am not sure whether I should have been better off attacking the corners...this group is quite safe as it is, right? Are F17 or F3 good alternatives?

xxc2 : this one for what ?];W[eg];B[fh];W[fg];B[fc]C[[Artigas\]
Now I am seeing that upper side is very white, so I need to move in...

xxc1 : seems dangerous to enter here now, W strong at left side]
;W[ec];B[ic]C[[Artigas\]
I decided to jump here in order not to be crowded. I thought of F16, but was afraid of white counter at K17, or thereabout.

xxc1 : a chance, F16 and K/J17 too easy for W];W[jc];B[jd];W[kc]

(;B[jg]C[[Artigas\]
OK, I thought I needed to answer here...but can white make much territory here anyway? Maybe it is better to approach with Q3?

xxc1: W is reducing here, look at the cut(s) and protect is the only way to answer here i think]

Securing life for my group, but in a very low position...now I am hoipng to reduce white territory with F6, rather than approaching the corner...and maybe I should just do C3?

xxc1 : C3 instead of F2?
i do not think F2 is ok];W[er];B[fn];W[fo];B[gn];W[hn];B[go]

In retrospect, This feels like an unnecessary move at this stage...I think I should have gone to the upper left...F15? E15? or maybe E18 followed by E16?]

Maybe just H15, instead of H14+H15?

xxc1 : doesn't change anything, both are gote];W[ji]
(;B[ki];W[kh];B[kg];W[li];B[lh]C[[Artigas\]
Walked into that one...some points more for white...some points less for black...

xxc1 : L12 instead of K11 ?];W[ki];B[og];W[of];B[oh]C[[Artigas\]
Again, maybe just O12, instead of O13+O12?

xxc1 : right same thing];W[fa];B[ga];W[me];B[qf];W[si];B[rj]
;W[os];B[ps];W[ln];B[sj];W[sh];B[hi];W[kl];B[qr]C[[Artigas\]
Here I know that white wants to put my group in atari, forcing P3, and I am afraid of some combination in the corner that may give seki...

xxc1 : right, dangerous];W[ll];B[oq];W[gi];B[hh]C[You can check your score with the score command, type 'done' when finished.
Click on a group of stones to mark it dead and remove it from the board.

xxc1 : well this first part is done
no big mistakes on fight or life&death, end game seems better for B, but something is missing  ... i think it is the most difficult thing to understand : when to switch local/global
i'll show some way with xxc2 now

xxc2 : i think it is the key for B ... get a better use of all the board from the beginning

hope this fun way to comment in 2 steps doesn't disturb you too much, and help you all
