C[i played white in this game.
i felt like i was losing throughout the game but ended up winning, although i can't understand why.

First of all let me say that I'm only 2 stones stronger than you, so I can't really teach you anything - I can only give you some ideas about how I would have played things differently and you'll have to make up your own mind if it's better or not.

***
 Perow 2d*: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.];B[oc]C[
 efurman 2d*: hello];W[po]C[do you have any comments on how i played the opening?]
;B[ec];W[do];B[df]C[playing like this both are inviting the other to invade their corners and fight.]
;W[pe];B[qd];W[qe];B[rd];W[ne];B[od];W[oe];B[re]
(;W[dk]C[i'm looking at UL corner and trying to build up my center presence with this move.  after i played this i wished i hadn't because i have to worry about b move at d7 later.  now i like d8 instead, even though that looks unusual.]
;B[jp]C[I think B is already leading]
(;W[hq]C[here i figure at attack on k4 stone is miai with sealing the left corner]
;B[cq]C[somehow attack on b stone doesnt seem so hot to me now

The usual order is to first close the corner, then extend along the side. You are trying to get both by attacking, but B's stone is high and not so difficult to handle so it's only natural he resists your plan and jumps in the corner first.]
;W[dq]
(;B[cp]C[i felt lucky that b played here instead of d2

I think you're right. B's move feels a bit like a 'raw peep' - it helps make your shape stronger.]
;W[dp];B[co];W[cn];B[bn]
(;W[cm]C[now i think b7 better

I think the move in the game is OK];B[bm];W[lp];B[jm]
(;W[lm]C[i thought about cutting but i thought b would jump at k9 first]
;B[hp];W[iq]
(;B[ip];W[jq];B[qq]C[this move made me feel flustered, i couldnt understand b leaving his group like that and sought to punish him with my next move]

(;W[jj]C[this is the best i came up with move doesnt seem that severe.  looking at it now i think l9 is better because it builds a moyo on the right]
;B[hl];W[hj];B[kp]
(;W[kq]C[now i think m3 better

maybe, but it has some problems with the G3 hane...];B[lo];W[mo]
;B[ll]
(;W[mn]C[this move seems a little slack, although my alternative is very risky I feel W has to fight here.]
;B[km];W[ml];B[ln];W[mm]C[ugh!! now r3 stone looks horrible for me]
;B[lk];W[jk];B[jl]
(;W[oq]C[yuck

are you sure this is the biggest side to play on? I thought the other side was bigger, but I could be wrong...]
;B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[hn]LB[li:B][mk:A]TR[hj][jj][jk]C[at this point im feeling pretty emotional about this game and look to start a fight because i'm so frustrated with my opponent's play

this kind of move is very heavy because you invest a whole move to make an attack which may end up giving you no points at all. I think it's a very bad move, the marked stones are clearly too weak to pose much of a problem to B and you're driving B out in the only area where you can make any points...]
;B[gn];W[gm];B[hm];W[go];B[fn];W[ho]
(;B[gp];W[fo];B[gj];W[fm];B[gk]C[B is running out in the wrong area where there is nothing much to be made and also lost the chance to make life instantly. W also protected the D6 weak spot, so I think overall this variation is not optimal for B.]
;W[hk];B[gl];W[cc]C[i've been staring at this move the whole game..]
;B[dd];W[be];B[cd];W[bd];B[cb];W[bb];B[dc];W[bc];B[ic];W[rm]
C[since you want to block here, the direction of P3 seems suspect...]

(;B[qo]C[this B move is a big aji-keshi losing the chance to cut at R7.]
;W[qm];B[pq];W[or];B[pp];W[op];B[pr];W[rf];B[mk];W[nk];B[nj]
;W[mj]C[i'm feeling desperate, b has three corners and i dont think i have much to show for it, i look to capture something

I can't blame you... it seems the only way to win.];B[rg];W[sf]
;B[ni];W[lj];B[qh]
(;W[qf]C[this move is a bit slow];B[mh]C[when B starts to counterattack you're already in big trouble...]

;W[ph];B[pi];W[oh];B[qj]C[i think i've lost at this point, but b doesnt punish me for it

I think so too...];W[pk];B[oi];W[qk]
(;B[og];W[pg];B[of];W[rj];B[rk];W[pj];B[qi];W[rl];B[pd];W[eg]
C[later it turns out this is the wrong move since w loses the capturing race unless makes a move

yes, you are lucky here];B[in]
(;W[il]C[again, this is a heavy move... you invest a whole move which you have to somehow recover (with interest) by attacking B.]

 Perow done
 Perow 2d*: Thank you for the game.];C[w win by ~10 points, although i didn't deserve it.  i played very poorly.
thank you in advance for the review

I hope you got some ideas from it - I tried very hard, but in the end I'm not really in a position to teach you anything... you make the kind of mistakes I make myself, only more of them ;)]

(;W[gc]C[this seems an interesting place to play to see if you can stir up another fight. If B starts fighting in two places you might end up killing something.]
;B[gb]C[so at this point he probably has to submit, and you've gained something. G17 is like a probe (yosu-miru) - you play it at a moment where it's hard for B to chose the continuation, then you can finish the sequence later when B would not have answered so peacefully to the first move.]

(;B[rk]C[In general, since W can only make one eye in gote it seems a better plan for B to extend the liberties by threatening to live before starting to reduce liberties. In this case B actually ends up making a sente eye so W loses the semeai outright...]

(;W[jp]C[Play in the largest open space (if there are no urgent moves) - another way to look at it is that it makes miai of closing/invading the two corners. My first thought was to close one of the corners, but I could not decide which was bigger so I came up with this move.]
)
(;W[dl]C[this are is not the biggest, and this move does not help much against C3 invasion. It's also too far from C17 to have much effect in that direction. It's a bit like you're trying too hard to make your move accomplish several things so it doesn't really do anything 100%.]
