Dear reviewer,

this is a game i played on kgs as black. I had no feeling how to use the handicap stones and where are the big points. I'm new to Go and maybe I'll should only play more games, but I wanted to know where are my bigest mistakes and how I should have looked on the positions.

I resigned after lossing the UR group, was this right? or was the game at this point lost anyway?

I'll thank you for your time and advise
ian

PS: hope my english is understandable and I'm sorry for the errors.

//Hi, I'm your reviewer.  On KGS I go by Flamer, but I am not too active on KGS.  If you have questions, it would probably be better to email me at ashrestha1994@gmail.com.  Feel free to email me.  I will note all of my comments with //.]
;W[dd];B[cf]C[// the thing about a handicap game (and this only applies to a handicap game) is that you should play defensively, because you start with an enormous advantage.  Try to avoid complicated fights, as you will very likely lose those.  Instead, keep it simple and let him have a little territory so long as you keep most of it.  There is no need to approach his top right corner when you can defend yourself at R10 or K3.]
;W[gd];B[dj]C[//Samething here.  You are playing too far, you could more easily stay safe at C11.]
;W[mc];B[pf]TR[qf][qg]C[ian: I'm not sure it's the right response, but I think its good to seal white in the corner.
//this is fine, its definitely smaller than you could go for but you should play safe in a handicap game.  The actual way to play this is very very complex and something im sure your opponent isn't aware of either.  I only know bits and pieces of it, and havent learned it entirely yet.  When i come across this in one of my games,  play either of the triangle positions depending on the strength of the bottom right and how much i need to earn.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[rf]
;W[sd];B[jq]TR[kc][kd]C[ian: Is it the best point to play, or should I have played somwhere else?

//this is a fine move.  I would be debating between this move and a move at the right side, something like R9.  In a non-handicap where you are playing someone of equal caliber, the L-16 move is acceptable (triangle) as well, in order to start a fight.  However, it does leave you weak as you are also somewhat pincered.  L17 is more aggressive, I would stick to L17 unless you are confident you can outfight your opponent.]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[fr]LB[cm:A][dr:B]C[ian: this move suprised me and I had no Idea how to handle this. i'm not sure if the result is so desireable. is it a good white move to attack from the 2nd line?

//this is a very odd move, definitely not standard.  I am not sure what the *best* way ist o respond, but given your situation I would try to protect your left side as much as possible.  I imagine he played low either as bait so you would try to kill it, or to ensure life (this choice is less likely than the former, as he may be too low).  My options would be either A or B.]
(;B[cm];W[fp]C[//close the corner.  It is where he can gain life.  So what if he runs?  You control the middle, he would have to literally run all the way to the top (which would solidify you the left in the fight) or spend time creating life in the middle, which would cause him to be over-concentrated and give him little profit.]
(;B[em];W[do];B[eo];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[bq];W[ep];B[en];W[br]
;B[bp];W[nq]LB[qn:A][lp:B]C[//never contact a weak stone is the rule I learned.  It creates large fights which force both players to grow and become stronger.  However, if he starts with a weak stone, you want his weak stone to become weaker, not stronger.  Instead, play from afar.  If you want to fight, press B.  I prefer A.]
(;B[oq]C[ian: I thought to attack with the K3 stone in position but after I played it I thought its wrong because K3 is weak with the white stones on the left and my move only strength the O3 stone, but how should I have played? (R6 or Q6?)]
;W[np];B[pn];W[oo];B[po];W[on];B[pm]C[ian: I thought get pushed from behind on the 4th line can't be bad, but now I think about to hane or to move out with the K3 stone. I'm not sure if I realy can escape with a play at K5 or if it only helps white to get strength?

//you are in a lot of trouble here.  I wouldn't bother trying to save k3, preferring to reduce instead.  K5 is acceptable, as is J5 or H5.  The latter 2 encourage you to ditch K3 and use it instead as a tool to threaten white with, allowing you to seal him and not let him grow upward.  The alternative is white playing G6.]
;W[om];B[pl];W[jn];B[nr]C[ian: I think its a unnecessary gote move
//yes it is, but you should still see its use.  Avoid it though.  see variation later on.]
;W[mr];B[or];W[hq]
(;B[cc]C[ian: is it the realy big to invade the corner? and is this line ok?
//this is fine, so long as you give yourself height at E14 if white plays the 3-3 at C16.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[bc];B[bb]C[//if white goes in on one side, you go out on the other.  Keep playing, now at G18.  Keep in mind this is situational though. as white is unlikely to get much from a wall that low in thsi game.]
;W[gb];B[bd];W[be];B[ac];W[bf];B[cg]C[ian: I thought to press white on the 2nd line is go becouse I was afraid that he cuts if I hane.

//yeah, probably a bad idea to hane here.];W[bg];B[ch];W[ce]
(;B[of]C[ian: now i wanted to close the space between my two right groups or is there a way to use my wall against the N17 stone, I was afraid to create a weak group for nothing.

//yeah, try the cut i mentioned earlier.  However, be more careful now, as you have strengthened white both at the bottom and at the left.]
;W[ne];B[oi];W[qi]C[ian: now I'm again suprised and had no idea how to handle this or is my last move so wrong?
//I would have played lower, at q11 instead of P11.  this is probably still salvageable though.]
(;B[qj]C[//dont contact the weak stone.  Q10 is just as useful, and doesn't give him a stone to attack.]
;W[rj];B[qk];W[rk];B[rl];W[qg];B[qf];W[oh]
(;B[ph]C[ian: i wanted to seal him in to get my groups connected and kill. maybe it's to greedy and i should have let him out while attacking him to gain something, but how?]

;W[mk];B[nl];W[mi];B[nh];W[mh];B[ng];W[lj]C[//look over this situation again, I see a way to live.]
(;B[mf]C[ian: now I hade no idea what to do so I tried to get out, but i don't saw the danger for the UR group to have only one eye]
;W[me];B[lf];W[le];B[ke];W[kf];B[kd]C[ian: now i hade the idea of attacking the white group N17 but...

//yeah, too late];W[kc];B[ld];W[md];B[lc];W[lb];B[je];W[kg]
;B[if];W[jb];B[go]C[ian: its a mistake. I thought to build a moyo by  threatening to connect to the K3 stone, but i should have played a litle bit away from the white stones
//right idea, too lane.  he is strong now.];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn]
;B[gm];W[hn];B[hm];W[im];B[il];W[jl];B[ik];W[jk];B[ij];W[mm]
C[ian: I dont understand this white move. was there a big chance to damage white?
//not huge, but it could be a game-changer if black Q14 were not going to die.]
;B[gf];W[hh]C[ian: I fellt this stone is to deep in my moyo and wanted to split him, but my first try don't work well.
//avoid teh contact play.  K12 should work.]
(;B[ih];W[ii];B[hi];W[ig];B[ji];W[hg];B[hf];W[fh];B[ef];W[ej]
C[ian: but now I think its a big overplay from white and I tried to cut again
//yeah, you did fine there, cutting him.];B[jg];W[jf];B[jh]
;W[gi];B[gj];W[fj];B[gg];W[gh];B[ei];W[eh];B[di];W[ff];B[fg]
;W[fe];B[eg];W[gk];B[hj];W[ie]C[ian: ok now my 5 stones are death, but the 10 white stones also death, so its maybe good. but i don't know war i was planning with the next moves??]
;B[lh];W[li];B[kh];W[jd];B[sk]C[ian: now i should have connected the UR group to the center but I don't saw the danger.

//yeah, that happens sometimes.];W[ri];B[sj];W[lg]
(;B[nf]C[ian: after this i saw that the group has only 1 eye and only tried some moves. I think my opponent knows this and soon I resigned.]
;W[rg];B[mb];W[nb];B[na];W[ma];B[nc];W[oa]C[player21 [9k\]: thx
ian42 [13k\]: thx

//your major problem seems to be that you are over-agressive.  avoid contacting weak stones, and really contacting stones in general.  if you do that, your game will become much better.  also, dont forget to reconsider groups like that upper-right group.  Thats a mistake everyone makes though, so dont worry too much about it and just pay a little more attention when you are playing.]
