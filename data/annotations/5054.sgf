C[FatParrot: Greetings and thanks to the unfortunate reviewer(s) who look at this ugly game of mine.

--------

Alex: You're most welcome.  Don't worry about the ugliness--it's interesting for me to see lots of shapes that never appear in my own games!  and besides, a stronger player would look at my games and say they were ugly, and so on...  All we can do is try and find the little bits we can improve...

I can give you three pieces of general advice:

1.  Play with a plan.  Every stone you put down should have at least one purpose.  If you remember what you're trying to achieve, then the game will make much more sense!

2.  Learn the concepts of "light" and "heavy".  Light stones are ones that you can afford to sacrifice.  I'll point out some examples as we go.

3.  Try to assess the whole board situation.  What are the largest areas?  Do you really need to kill something in order to make the game close?

Now let's go through move by move and look at the fine details...]
;B[pq];W[dc];B[pd];W[dq];B[do];W[co];B[cn]C[Alex: so far, very good.]

(;W[bo]C[Alex: Now, this move is a bit unusual.  It's hard to say for sure that it's a bad move (in fact, it has been played in professional games), but as a general principle you try to play most of your opening moves on the 3rd or 4th line.  Playing on the 2nd line like this, unless you have a specific plan, can easily lead you into a passive position.

The normal way to play here is C4.  See the variations.];B[dp]
;W[cq];B[dl];W[ce]LB[bn:a][fq:b]C[FatParrot: WC15 is okay? or is the bottom still not finished? I thought I was okay when I was playing but it looks a little cramped...

--------

Alex: It's hard to say.  G3 and R5 both look tempting as well.  But I think C15 is OK.

Notice that your stones around C3 have two directions to move: 'a' (B6) and 'b' (F3).  If black blocks one of these directions, then you should move in the other.]
;B[bn]
(;W[cp]C[Alex: This is very small.  You're defending maybe 4 points of territory, but there's a big open space on the right.  See the variation.]
;B[jd];W[qo]C[Alex: Good move.  You found the biggest open space on the board.]
;B[qm]C[Alex: This is a pincer attack by black: see how R5 is caught between two enemy stones.  This sort of position has a way of becoming very complicated!

As a general principle, your goal is to move out into the centre and keep the two black stones separated.  Later on, you can hope to counterattack against one side or the other.]

(;W[qq]LB[pp:a][eq:b]C[FatParrot: WR3 is a bad choice? My opponent suggested that WP4 BQ6 would be the only reasonable follow-up but I do not understand WP4. Isn't it just reasonable for black to block (BP3) and make points along the bottom?

--------

Alex: R3 is not so bad (if you follow it up correctly), but again there's a danger of getting a passive position.  Imagine if black gets the chance to play at 'a' (Q4) and later at 'b' (E3)--it could turn into a very large centre area.

I think that P5 is the most natural move for white.  P4 works too, but is more complicated.  Yes, black gets points on the bottom, but then you get to attack R7 in return.  I'll show you some variations for both moves.]
;B[pp]
(;W[po]C[FatParrot: I guess this was a bad idea but WR4 didn't look too hot either...

--------

Alex: Yes, this is a bad idea.  R4 is the correct move here.  See variation.]
;B[qp]TR[qo][qq]C[Alex: This sort of pattern is very common.  Letting black separate the R3 and Q3 stones is bad--it's important to play S4 next.]

(;W[pm]C[Alex: What is your plan here?  As a general principle, making a contact move against an enemy stone will strengthen it.  You want the R7 stone to stay weak so that you can attack it later.  See variation.]
;B[ql];W[no]TR[qo][po]C[Alex: Now your goal is to make life for the R5 stones.  The Q7 stone might come in useful, but if it does get captured it doesn't really matter, as long as R5 lives.  In other words, Q7 is a light stone.]
;B[qn];W[rp];B[pn]
(;W[oo]C[Alex: It might be better to make an eye in the corner.  See variation.]
;B[rq]
(;W[sq]C[Alex: This is a mistake.  Later in the game, you could play S2 instead.  See variation.]

(;B[qr]C[Alex: You were lucky, black made a mistake too. Black should play S2 not R2.]

(;W[rr]C[FatParrot: Unreasonable? I was fishing for something to appear that would help me make life and keep some points on the bottom.

--------

Alex: Yes, this is unreasonable.  You can't make an eye in the corner.  I think something like O3 would be better.]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[mr];W[lr]C[FatParrot: It seems this was bad...

--------

Alex: Yes, it was.  Play M3 not M2.

This shape (M2, N3 against N2, O3) is often good, but in this case your first priority is to look after your stones at O5.]

(;B[lq]C[Alex: Another mistake by black.];W[mp];B[kr];W[nr]
;B[ls]
(;W[or]C[Alex: Wow, this gets complicated now!  I wondered about playing P3 here, but I think your way is better.]
;B[oq];W[pr]C[FatParrot: Apparently I mis-read. Can you suggest another path before I met this demise?

--------

Alex: Well, it was your move at Q5 that got you into this mess.  But it's not over yet: see the variation at move 48 coming up...]
;B[qq];W[qs];B[rs]
(;W[rn];B[ps];W[rm]C[Alex: This is a wasted move: it doesn't actually make an eye!]
;B[rl]C[Alex: If you play T7 to try and make an eye, black can throw in at T5 and the eye is false.]
;W[nm]LB[ml:a][kn:b]C[Alex: This is too close--your stones are overconcentrated.  It's hard to decide what the perfect move is here, but something like 'a' (N8) or 'b' (L6) would be better.]
;B[pj];W[qf]TR[pj][jd]LB[nc:a]C[Alex: This is the wrong direction.  Compare the K16 stone with Q10.  Which is strongest?  I would prefer 'a' (O17) to R14.]
;B[qh]
(;W[qc]C[FatParrot: Is WR17 okay? Or something like P14 is better? R17 didn't feel so good anymore after I played it through.

--------

Alex: I think R17 is the best you can do here.  See variation.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[oc]LB[nc:a]C[Alex: Instead of P17, play 'a' (O17).]
;B[me];W[pl]LB[jo:a][fq:b][hc:c][ci:d]C[Alex: This is an example of a heavy move.  You should be very happy for black to waste a move capturing Q7, it's only worth 2 points.  When you try to keep ALL your stones alive, things get much more difficult!

Instead of Q8, you can help your centre group by playing around 'a' (K5), or you can consider the big moves at 'b' (F3), 'c' (H17) or "d' (C11).  I'm sorry that I'm not strong enough to tell you which is best!  but they are all better than Q8.]
;B[pk]
(;W[on]C[Alex: This is a terrible move!  It's very heavy, and achieves nothing except connecting your stones together.  If you really want to save the Q7 and Q8 stones, you can do it by playing N9.  See the variations.]
;B[mj]LB[lb:a][hc:b][ci:c][gq:d][eq:e]C[Alex: This is a good time to pause and assess the position.

White has territory in three corners: about 10 points each at top right (T19) and bottom left (A1), and about 12 points at top left (A19).  All three areas have good potential for expanding, at 'a' (M18), 'b' (H17), 'c' (C11) and 'd' (G3).  Assuming that the centre stones live, and that R14 is captured, white can expect to end up with around 50 points of territory.

Black has about 15 points in the bottom right corner, about 30 on the right side, and a few points on the left side.  These areas also have a lot of potential to expand, around 'c', 'e' (E3), and 'f' (K10).  With the 5.5 points reverse komi, black can expect to end up with around 60 points of territory.

So, you're losing, but not by a huge margin.  This is decision time: do you try to do something aggressive to upset the balance? or do you hang tight and try to catch up in the endgame.  Personally, I can't see a good place for you to attack, so I would play 'd' and hope that black slips up somewhere.]
;W[rf]LB[mg:a]C[Alex: This is just suicidal!  These two stones don't have a hope of escaping.  If you're going to try something in this area, 'a' (N13) has more chance.]
;B[se];W[ng]C[FatParrot: O13 is unreasonable?

--------

Alex: Yes, it's unreasonable.  I won't comment on the next few moves... skip ahead to move 94.]

;B[og];W[oh];B[ph];W[nj];B[ni];W[mi];B[oi];W[nk];B[lj];W[kh]
;B[jg];W[jp]C[Alex: This is an interesting move!  I don't think it quite works, because black can cut it off--see the variation for the next move--but it's still worth a try.]

(;B[jq]C[Alex: Black should play M4: see variation.]
(;W[ji]C[I was kind of desperate to kill something now...

--------

Alex: Well, you're not much worse off than you were back at move 70 (when you played S14).  Since black has played passively at K3, you should follow up with L4.  There's no need to feel desperate yet.

K11 is bad shape (as you find out after black's next move); if you want to play in this area, L11 is better.]
;B[ki]
(;W[lh]C[Alex: L10 would be better, sacrificing a stone to squeeze black into a heavy shape.  See the variation.]

(;W[el]TR[jh][ji][kh][lh][mh][mi][nj][nk][nm][pl][pm][on][no]
[mp][mq][oo][po][qo][rn][rm][rp][sq]C[Alex: This move makes no sense to me!  You still have two weak groups on the board (K11 and O5), so you should try to defend at least one of them!]

(;B[dk]C[Alex: Black should have ignored E8, and captured some of your stones instead.]
;W[hh];B[hf];W[hj]TR[hh][ji][jh]C[Alex: Good move, the four marked stones make a nice shape (H10, H12, K11, K12).]
;B[jm];W[hl];B[il];W[hm];B[hp]C[Alex: Now, K4 is a light stone--there's no need to rescue it.  Instead, you need to make sure that your K11 group survives! maybe with a move around E11.]
;W[io];B[ko];W[kp];B[lp];W[lo];B[jo];W[ip];B[in]
(;W[iq]C[FatParrot: Some hope in Wh6? Or is this the only way to go? It looks grim but it'd be nice if it worked out somehow.

--------

Alex: Yes, it does look grim.  The position is rather complicated, but I think H5 (not H6) is your best chance.  See variations.]
;B[hn];W[ir];B[fg];W[ho];B[gn];W[kk]C[Alex: Good, you need to do something to make your O5 group live.]
;B[kj];W[kl];B[jl];W[ln];B[fi]TR[hm][hl][hj][hh][jh][ji][kh]

;W[fk];B[hi];W[fn];B[gm];W[dn]C[FatParrot: Another bad read... but in hindsight it looks like this whole sequence was in vain anyways?

--------

Alex: Yes.];B[fo];W[eo];B[ep];W[cm];B[dm];W[eq];B[ch]C[FatParrot: I just tried to save some face and not waste any more of Zaraki's time.

--------

Alex: You made the right decision!

Up to move 20, you had a good position.  Your biggest mistake in this game was in the lower right corner, where you played Q5 instead of connecting at R3.  The other big mistake was to try to escape with the R14 stone.

For most of the game, you had a good fighting attitude.  If you can learn to think about the whole board, and judge when you can afford to sacrifice stones, I'm sure you will keep improving.]
