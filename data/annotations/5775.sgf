feel free to ask if something is unclear.

(;W[dj]LB[ri:B][mj:A]C[no; right now the black group at the right is very weak. Also there is danger that your group at P13 get sealed in. 

How about arround A? it gives you access to the center and threatens B. It might not kill black but gives some trouble.]

play at B!];B[go];W[gn];B[hn];W[ho];B[gp];W[io];B[in];W[ep]

afterwards your E5 group has one liberty less which you might need later bekause of B]

(;W[pq];B[pr]LB[ri:A]C[Ok. the game is over here i think. there is not much white can do now to win this.

There are some points that i noticed.

first of all; even if a group looks big; check if its a strong one ( already alive ) or has a weakness. ( the group at A ); A weakness does not allways mean that you can kill it, but to get as much as possible out of it by just threatening to kill.

second you very often play to close (!) keep away from strong groups and (!) allways attack from distance. 

if you attach at an enemy stone you will mostly make "his" group stronger; so think twice before attaching.]
