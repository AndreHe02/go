C[Dear Reviewer,

I think I must brush up my opening strategy. I'm used to the Sanren Sei
and it leads to big moyos. In this game, I ended up with two weak groups on opposite sides of the
board, and had to drop the smaller one. Maybe I don't know how to handle them, or should not
create so many, or whatever. You might be able to point out my faulty decisions. A manual count sees me
12 points behind even before I committed the two final blunders.

Many thanks for reviewing this game !

Hello,

I have played sanrensei very much in my kyu days, so I hope I can help you out with this game.

- Velirun];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[cd];B[jq]C[I play the "low" Sanren Sei since I got messed up a few times with early invasions when I played the high variation.

Velirun: The low point here is rarely played.  The point behind 3-star is not to take territory - rather, it is to take lots of influence and attack.  It is easy to not understand this.  With 3-star, you should welcome an invasion and take your quick influence.

Velirun: When you play low like this... there are so many simple invasions to kill your territory.  I really, really do not like it.]
;W[qn]
(;B[pk]C[I prefer this to the attach and extend joseki since it keeps the right side from becoming a white moyo.

Velirun:  I would not recommend the attach and extend joseki with 3-star or this.   It is normally bad style.  If you are going to pincer, the normal one is one space low.  See variations.]
;W[on]C[Velirun:  I would prefer to enter 3-3 instead of helping black with a moyo.]
;B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[rk];B[mn];W[ol]C[Velirun:  This move is much much too slow.]
;B[dj];W[ok]C[Velirun:  Another horribly slow move.];B[nc];W[ne]
;B[ld]C[Velirun:  Could also enter 3-3.];W[ec];B[ic];W[ch];B[cj]
C[C6 might have been better.

Velirun:  Feels not so good...  I still don't like K3 being low.  I think I would consdier F4 instead of C10.]
;W[dn];B[fo]C[Velirun:  Normally this should be on the fourth line, but I can't find an easy way to punish this.]
;W[cp];B[cq];W[co];B[eq]C[Velirun:  Should be at B3 to keep white from getting a base.  Huge error!]
;W[bq];B[cr]C[Velirun:  Painful exchange!];W[cl]C[Velirun:  You must pay mind to your two black stones on the left now.  They are floating, and you don't want to damage your moyo.  Perhaps F7 is a good start - see variation.]

(;B[el]C[Velirun:  Of course, white will attach at F6.];W[fn]
;B[gn];W[fm]C[Velirun:  Painful!];B[gm];W[fl];B[eh];W[df];B[nh]
C[Maybe there was no time for this, or I should just have played N9 "at the border of two moyos".
The idea was to peek in the door before the white moyo gets too large.

Velirun:  Your biggest mistake.  You must secure your two stones on the left before they are severely attacked.  They have no base and will only end up hurting your moyo.  You must *not* create a second weak group on the board - it makes white have an easy time.]
;W[ph];B[og]C[Velirun:  Even now, should enter R17 instead.]

;W[mm];B[lm];W[gl];B[ff]TR[eh][dj]C[Velirun:  Another weak shape.  Try not to run away with knight's moves in such an attack.]
