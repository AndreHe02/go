C[Hello,I am a beginner.
In this game, i am playing black and i think i have played badly at the beginning but i don't know how to get improvement. Any comments about Black are appreciated.

NA-Hi, my name is Nathan and I will precede my comments with NA.
      This game is unusual to comment because usually it is better to send a game you have lost, but not a crushing defeat, in to the teaching ladder.  That way your weakness are highlighted and there will be alot more value to the commentary.  My score estimator shows you winning by 1.5 so it's still close but the game seems pretty even and at first glance it was hard for me to see anything really obvious to comment on.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[fc]C[NA-One thing I did notice is that this game was basically one big fight.  Go is interesting because there are alot of levels to it.  This game is conducted almost exclusively at the tactical level (small scale fighting).  Go is a game of territory.  Fighting is an essential part of the game but it should be considered a means to an end rather than an end in itself.
      This opening is pretty fast.  There's nothing wrong with it but one thing to consider might be to play more influence oriented moves at the beginning.  This means playing stones out in open areas to establish your influence there.  You are not going to be able to prevent your opponent from making some territory during the game so you have to spend some time building your own position.  The beginning is the best time to do this.  Try spreading your stones around first before engaging in fighting.]
;W[hc];B[db]C[NA-The standard response for black here I think is to jump out to F15.  You can consult a joseki dictionary (there are plenty free resources online).  The reason F15 would be better here is that it would help to prevent you from getting sealed into the corner the way you do.  This isn't really a very good result.  You end up with the corner but white ends up very strong outside.  This is what leads to your frustration at white's expansion later.  You can make this move later after you have ensured a way out.]

;W[be];B[ad];W[dg];B[jd];W[hb];B[ga]
(;W[ha];B[gb]C[NA-This sequence seems ok to me aside from the problem I noted earlier.   I did put in a variation that looks like it could kill for white.  Another major disadvantage about getting sealed in like this is that you have to be very careful about managing your eyespace.  Alot of times it looks like you have plenty but then white plays on some vital point inside and you realize you're dead.]
;W[kb]C[It seems that i can stop white from expanding.

How can i respond to this move?

NA-Really the only thing to do in this situation is like I was saying at the beginning.  You have to pull back and build something of your own.  This is really a very small move by white.  If you played a move to extend either of your corners, or play at K4 or Q10 or were to make an approach move to the lower white corner you would be making a vastly better move than either the move you make or the alternative you consider.]
;B[jb];W[jc];B[ic]C[Is L17 better?];W[kc];B[ib];W[id];B[je]
;W[nd];B[of]C[NA-This is a decent reply but you might also consider playing on the Q or R lines.  R13 might be good.  These would still be putting some pressure on white but also expanding your territory more solidly.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[pj]C[NA-Good];W[pe];B[qe]C[NA-I think it would probably be better to go over rather than under here.]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[pg];B[og]C[NA-You basically already made the decision to leave the P14 stone outside the white line when you played under at R15.  To play this move now is inconsistent and lead to double trouble for you.]

NA-N16 captures the 4 white stones so yes it is definitely better.]

NA-There's not a whole lot to argue with in this game.  You are both content to just play one fight sprawling around the board.  Thats ok but there's alot more to go than that.  Look at some proffessional games (www.gobase.org for example or other sites also) or watch some of the dan player games (NOT lightning or blitz) on the server you play on.  In those game they spread out at the beginning and the fighting that happens serves the purpose of their overall strategy.  I think for the most part you and your opponent both seem to be fighting well.  I don't look at the sequences and say to myself  "What were they thinking?"   The outcomes seem reasonable for the most part and there are some interesting sequences.  Keep playing!  Thanks for the opportunity to review your game.
