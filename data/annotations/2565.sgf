C[Hi,

I was wondering if you could point out unnecessary plays as I seem to make them a lot. Also I would like to know if there was a much better move than the one that I played and why it's so. A few times when I try to invade his territory, I fail and so I was what I would have to do to succeed.

Thank-You.



Hmmm. Alright. Some preliminaries:
1. It's been my experience that Go has a lot of subtleties. As a result, I find that there are different levels/rankings that determine the kind of advice you get. Just keep in mind that it's not until the later dan levels that players 'know' what they are talking about. To get to the point, most of the stuff I am going to recommend will be standard kinds of things; stuff that can be found in books. :)

2. Read books if you can. Kiseido is having a sale right now, so you might be able to get some cheap ones there. I got most of mine at Amazon, cause they have good prices. High level dans and many other players would recommend these 3 books: Tesuji by James Davies; Life & Death by James Davies; and Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go by Kageyama. Each book is about $15 US on Kiseido at regular price. You might want to consider The Second Book of Go By T. Bozulich since it has a terrific treatment of liberties.

3. Play lots. No subsitute for experience. Also, good to expirement - find out for yourself what works and what does not.

4. Keep your groups connected. If you connect your groups, you have 1 group that is stronger than the two or more groups you had before. Keeping groups connected means guarding cutting points and knowing how to capture enemy cutting stones. If you can capture these stones, then you stay connected. 

5. I'm not going to jump into crazy detail in this review - probably do more harm than good. I'll focus on your questions and point out some alternatives here and there.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[eo]LB[dp:A][cq:B]C[This move at the 5-5 point is unusual. Typically, the idea is to take the corners, then the sides and finally go for the middle. It is important to understand that it is easiest to make a living group in the corner, then on the side, and lastly in the middle. Ask a higher level player next time you are online to show you the smallest living shapes in the corner, sides and middle. Count the number of stones needed and the size of the Goban used.

The 4-4 point (A) is often used because it has a nice balance between the corner and the center. Some players like the 3-3 (B) point because it claims the corner as territory. The 5-5 point I would avoid because it is too far from the corner, which leaves it away from the easiest areas to make life (i.e. the corner and the side). Groups with no eyes are often called floating groups. I'll use that term from now on.]

the J5 point is really important for both sides, as you have seen from the earlier branch. Black isn't dead yet, but now something along the lines of C8 is necessary (see previous branch).]

This connection cannot be broken. White has a wall (marked by circles), which radiates influence and that helps white in any battles in the area marked by triangles. Essentially, black is at a disadvantage, and it's so big that white isn't going to get disconnected.

See (upcoming) branch in the tree for a disconnection attempt by black.]

So yeah, J17 probably is good, but you can expect an attack at O16 to result in a cut by white at H13 when the time is ripe.]
