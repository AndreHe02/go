C[Hello. I am black in this game against a 5k KGS (I'm 6k).

-----
Hello,

I'm Felix, your reviewer. I'll mark all my comments with a preceding "F:".

Summary:
Overall your thinking is very reasonable. But it seems, that you are too focused on the local situation, especially during a fight. Allways try to take the hole board situation into account.
Ask yourself: How do I want to take profit during this fight?
If you do not have a plan, don't attack just because the group is weak.
I also noticed some bad shape moves during the fighting. Therefore I would recommend you to read the book "Tesuji" from James Davies (Volume 3 of the Elementary Go Series).
If you have further question, do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
Felix a.k.a. djifmaster on KGS];B[qd]C[jamesuwe [5k\]: hi
jusi [6k\]: hello];W[dd]C[jusi [6k\]: have fun];B[pq];W[dq]
;B[co]LB[oc:A][od:B]C[F: General speaking enclosing or approaching an open corner has the same value. So your move is ok. But enclosing with 'A' seems more common in this situation, because Black doesn't want White to approach at B, making good shape with the top left corner.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[gq]C[I find G3 a bit unusual (usually it is F3), but I prefer not to take any risk at this time and to wait the right opportunity later in the game (it will occur actually :-)).

F: Your attitude is good. First strengthen yourself and wait for the right opportunity later in the game.]
;B[ck];W[cg];B[qk]LB[oc:A][qf:B]C[I think about an approach of the upper left corner (D17 or F17) but see nothing very good right now. And I'm black: thus I prefer to play a quiet move, waiting for a better opportunity.

F: Becaue White already played C13, an approach move in the top left corner will probably get pincered. Biggest move on the board in my opinion is at 'A', reasons are:
1. General rule: First enclose the corner, then play an extension.
2. A move around 'A' is also White's next "logical" continuation. See variation for example.
Maybe you confused your move with the Mini Chinese Formation, then the your upper right stone should be on 'B'.]
(;W[qn]LB[nc:A]C[I think this move was not very good because if I close the corner it cannot expand in a nice way...

F: Approaching around A would be much better. See variation.]
;B[qo]C[But this move was not good too: R4 or S4 would be better.

F: You are right, contact play is bad here. R4 is common response.]
;W[ro]C[This move shows me why R5 was not very good]
(;B[qp]LB[pn:A]TR[qk]C[F: Another option could be to play at 'A' instead. This would exchange the corner for superior outside influence. It depends on the surrounding position and your style of play.
But protecting the corner makes sense, because the marked stone is in good position.
See variation for possible continuations.];W[rp];B[rq];W[pm]
LB[od:E][ph:C][qh:B][ok:D][rm:A]C[I think about S7 ('A') but it was gote. R12  ('B') was too flat. Thus I choose Q12 ('C'). But maybe P9 ('D') was better (beginning to build a moyo while attacking)?

F: I added a fifth option at 'E'.
Let's have a look at the different options here. See variations.]
(;B[ph]LB[od:E][ph:C]C[F: I can understand the thinking behind this move. You strengthen yourself looking for attacking the White group. I think this move is ok, allthough I prefer 'E' over 'C'.]
;W[qf]C[F: Very aggressive. This is not necessary.];B[od]C[I think about R13 to strenghten my right group, but I prefer this one: it is a big point which attacks the white stone and, even if my right group remains weak, it is between two weak groups. P16 also makes possible a connection between the two groups.

F: R13 also strengthens your opponent. So this move is perfect.]
;W[pe]C[F: Black says "Thank you."];B[pd];W[rh]
(;B[oe]C[Menace to connect the two black groups and to enclose the white one, while improving influence in the upper side: I like this move :).

F: Your thinking is right. But locally there is a move, which is a little better. See variation.]
;W[of]
(;B[pg]LB[nf:A]C[F: This move is inconsistent. You said, you wanted to build influence on the top, so you should continue and play 'A' instead.]
;W[pf];B[qi];W[ri];B[rj]C[As expected: white group is not alive and I'm much more stronger now.

F: Actually your group on the right has no eyes yet. See variation.]
(;W[mc]C[jamesuwe [5k\]: yes!
This move was a surprise for me!

F: This move creates a third weak white group.];B[kc]TR[od]
[oe]C[I found O17 a coward play. I investigate a little N15 or 16 but I finally prefer to pincer: I could take the upper side while approaching the left side. My upper-right group becomes weak but I can still close the  corner or got out to the center. Moreover, I expect to create a third white weak groups.

This move begins a hard and long fight (the next 74 moves). Maybe N15 or N16 better? I don't know at all.

F: As you said previously, you created some strength to the top with your marked stones, so a pincer ist very good.
N16 only strengthens your opponent, it is similar to a play at O17. N15 also makes it to easy for White.]
;W[ld];B[hc]LB[id:A]C[F: To attack the two white stones at the top, you better play at 'A'. Otherwise White has the opportunity to get good shape with pressing you down. See variation.]
(;W[fc]LB[id:A]C[F: White has the opportunity to press down Black at 'A' instead.]
;B[me]C[Upper black stones are still weak but this move keep white groups separated while going out to the center. My upper "group" is only two stones: either it will be strenghten by the ongoing sequence or it will leave some aji here (they are only two stones).

F: Keeping the white groups disconnected is a very good idea.]
;W[ng];B[ke]LB[kd:A][je:C][le:B][kf:D]C[this one is probably not very good. Maybe L16 inducing white M15 then black N14 would be better.

F: Moves like 'A' or 'B' are bad style, because they are pushing from behind and you only hurt yourself. In cases like this moves like 'C' or 'D' are often appropriate.]
;W[kd];B[jd];W[le];B[mf];W[je];B[kf];W[re]C[I think this move is a white mistake. K17 looks very big to me.

F: Right, K17 or M14 are more important.];B[id]LB[kb:B][jc:A]
C[Thus I defend the K17 cut while preparing the capture of the white cutting stone

F: I would prefer to defend the cut at 'A'. Like this White has the opportunity to make an eye starting at 'B'.]
;W[ob]C[jamesuwe [5k\]: and=?];B[pb]C[I try to create an eye in the corner but the final local result was not very good: maybe M14 would be better?

F: M14 would be a secure variation, leaving no aji. But Q18 is not bad at all. Now White has to create life somehow.]
;W[rd]
(;B[rc]LB[lf:A]C[F: This move is not necessary. Black can kill at 'A'.]
;W[lf]
(;B[jf]LB[lg:A]TR[le][lf]C[Now my upper groups is stable even if it is still depending on a shisho (which is ok right now).
White N13 looks problematic, but either I let it connect and easily leave in the corner (but it is coward play) or I play M13 and begin a semiai between the two groups (and I guess I will win it even if I'm not 100% sure)...

F: Cutting trough a bamboo joint like White did with the marked stones is unacceptable. Black has to block at 'A'. See variation.]
;W[lg]C[White doesn't want to begin a semai...];B[mg]C[Keep it separated...]
;W[rb];B[qc]LB[mh:B][nh:A]C[Not sure about this but looks sente.

F: It depends on what you want. If you do not want White to create an extra eye with the group on the right, then this move is sente. But if you don't care about the right, then you could ignore and play at 'A' or 'B' for example.]
;W[sc];B[mh]C[Ok: no more eye in the corner: must run... That is not good. But now I pretty close of my other group and white is very separated now: that is good.]
;W[nh];B[lh]TR[ld][le][lf][lg]C[keep it separated while preparing a bigger jump to the center.

F: Now you really have a difficult fight, because you also have two weak groups. It is all because of the cut trough the bamboo joint.]
;W[kg];B[if]C[The shisho was broken by the previous white move: thanks to J14, it is no more a shisho but a sure eye.
I hesitate between this move (which let a white forcing move at H15) and a direct capture at J15, but then K13 is sente and it may be a tesuji at J14 also which helps white to go out.

F: I think this move is ok. Your reasoning is correct. But you have to watch out]
;W[oc]LB[nb:A]C[It was a gote move for not even a sure eye: not very good :-).

F: This move threatens to connect the two white groups and prevents Black from making an eye at 'A'. I think this move is quite reasonable.]
;B[sd]LB[qa:A]C[I guess it is sente and prevent an easy eye for this white group.

F: If you want to prevent an eye in the corner you should play at 'A', but it is a gote move.]
;W[sb]C[I didn't think about this move, but it is still ok for me: aji is here...]
;B[qb]C[But I have to prevent the connection of the two white groups. So T15 was gote...]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[lc]C[Now it has one sure eye, but it is not yet alive.]
;B[ni]LB[jc:A]C[enclose the white group while trying to connect (sadly if white N11, the shisho does not work, thus I am not 100% connected). But white must live first, thus I can expect sente at the end of the sequence.

F: Good move, I guess most people would connect at 'A'.];W[se]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[ra];W[si];B[sf];W[sg]C[Ok it is alive but I have sente and there is still some aji: not so bad.]
;B[nf]TR[pg][qg][ph]C[F: This move is not necessary, it has no effect. White can simply connect. But your marked stones will loose one liberty during this exchange. So it is bad.]
;W[og];B[oi];W[nd];B[md];W[jc];B[ib];W[jh];B[nm]C[At the time being, the white upper group is ok (could have two eyes or go out in two different directions). The black upper group is also mostly ok (could have two eyes or run). I decide to attack the white left group which looks now very weak. I attack this way because it is a strong attack and it gives a lot of space to my above group which is still not yet alive.

F: Your reasoning is ok. But you have to consider the hole board situation. The last 50 moves have been a tough fight for both side. What did you get? What did your opponent get?
If you go back to move 13 and look at the board. White played in an area where you already had 3 stones. So you would expect to get more points in this area. White settled two groups and you got almost no points.
White on the other hand has still his two corners and only one weak group left (started with three groups).
I just want to say that attacking without achieving something or making profit, is not good. If you attack a group, just because it is weak, it is not good. It is better then to leave it like it is and maybe come back later.]
;W[nc];B[ne]C[jusi [6k\]: thx];W[on];B[np]C[Take points while trying to enclose white.

F: This is the right thing to do! Now you attack while taking profit. You have a clear plan.]
;W[nn];B[mm]C[Maybe N5 was better but I prefered to strenghten my above groups. Maybe it was a coward play?

F: I think this move is ok.];W[mo];B[mp]LB[lp:B][lq:A]C[F: This is pushing from behind. Better to play at 'A'. In some cases, 'B' is also possible.]

[cs][ds][es][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Ok white escapes but I take points: white and black territories look quite similar but I think that white has much more weaknesses than me.

for white:
- upper left is still open.
- lower left is not so strong because of G3 instead of F3
- lower right group is still weak
- upper group is not fully alive

for black:
- upper group is still a bit weak
- center group is still a bit weak too but has now room for eyes
- left group is solid even if it is still not territory
- below right group now looks like a territory even if it may be reduced still a bit (some weaknesses remain at L3, P3, R2 or S2)

F: I marked the points, which I think are territory at the moment. It is almost even, but White has komi. So White is leading at the moment.
You are right that White probably has more weaknesses left. If you take this into account, the game is very close.]

LB[cc:D][ci:C][pk:A][ol:B]C[Attack the white group again in order to grow up center influence which begins to look like a moyo.

F: I think you cannot expect much in the center. Because White can poke at 'A' or 'B'. The biggest move is probably 'C'. This move makes an invasion at 'D' even more severe.]
;W[rl]C[white tries to live in place.];B[ql];W[rm];B[sp]C[It was a mistake...]
;W[sj]C[... White is connected :-(.];B[cc]LB[ci:A][bm:C][cm:B]
C[jamesuwe [5k\]: ah!
End of the big fight beginning with N16. Quite happy but not so confident and I want to reduce white upper left corner.
I cannot read all the sequences, but I expected that, even if I die, I could strenghten the outside and reduce white framework.

F: I would prefer 'A' first, after that, you can invade. Like this White has the opportunity to build up some influence to the right and then invade at 'B' or 'C', because the group is not so strong.]
;W[dc]LB[cd:A]C[F: White should block at 'A'.];B[bd];W[ce]C[White lets me live easily.]
;B[bb];W[db];B[ac];W[be];B[ba]C[C19 was better... I'm alive very easily. But now my upper group looks weaker...]
;W[cb];B[cd];W[bj]LB[ci:A][bj:B]C[F: Usually you play 'A' first, then 'B'.]
;B[cj];W[bk];B[bl];W[ci];B[cl]C[This sequences gives points in sente to white and reduce my right framework but it is now strong and I get outside influence.

F: At this stage of the game, if there is nothing to attack, influence is not so important anymore.]
;W[ol]C[Attack against my center group.];B[mk]TR[kn]C[I hesitate to tenuki but this point looks big: it connect both parts of the framework and reduce the risk of the N11 cut.

F: Now you see, that there are no points in the center. So the marked stone is kind of wasted move.]
;W[nk];B[lj]LB[mj:A]C[Now all center groups are definitely connected and the N11 cut does not work for sure. But I cannot expect anymore any point in this part of the board.

F: A move at 'A' leaves less aji.];W[ln]LB[jj:D][bo:B][bp:A]
[ks:C]C[F: Points are in the corners and at the edge. Moves like 'A' to 'C' are quite big. Also 'D' would be a very good move.]
;B[ii]LB[mb:A]C[I'm not sure to understand the previous move: I do not want to defend the lonely stone at L6 and it does not improve any moyo since the left and the above parts are still very open.

Thus I tenuki and attack the last weak white group. This move also tries to do a (new) center moyo even if it is still very open at the top and the bottom..

F: Your thinking is ok, but White could always make a seki starting with 'A'. So the move is not very severe. See variation.]
(;W[ji]LB[mb:A]C[F: White should simply live with 'A' (seki). Because the center is open from three side, Black won't get much points there.]
;B[jj];W[ih];B[hi];W[hh];B[gi]C[I'm building my moyo by being pushed...

F: Yes, it helps you. But White builds also strength to attack your top group.]
;W[gb]C[Ok now my upper group must live...];B[gg]C[get space for eyes in sente.]
;W[gh];B[fh]C[Stop the white: it is still not yet alive, but neither the black group is.

F:];W[fi];B[fg]C[I expected a cut at F13 instead of F11. I choose to strenghten my above group while letting white disconnected. But now my center moyo should be drastically reduced.]
;W[fj];B[hk];W[he]C[A life and dead problem begins...
If I simply connect at J15, then white G16 and it seems difficult to find more room for the second eye.

F: Correct.];B[gd]C[Thus I disconnect this attacking stone.]
;W[hf];B[hg]LB[mb:A]C[Let it separated... And these white stones look dead now and it looks like a living shape for me :-)).

F: You are right.White needs to play at 'A' now.];W[ge];B[fe]
;W[fd];B[gf]C[I guess I was a bit coward here and another move was probably possible (E15 or F14?).

F: Well, nothing bad about taking a liberty in a fight. If you cannot read it out, I suggest to take liberty and play the "coward"-style. You are ahead right now, so you do not need to risk anything.
E15 would be better, because White should connect. So you have sente.]
;W[ee];B[ff];W[di]C[White definitively enters in my moyo...]
(;B[ma]LB[ka:A]C[But this white upper group is definitively disconnected and does not look alive.

F: There is a proverb saying: "In hane lies the death."
You can kill starting with the hane at 'A'. See variation.]

F: Yes, ko is still good for Black. But you could kill. ;-)]

;W[kb]C[jamesuwe [5k\]: mmm
jamesuwe [5k\]: boring];B[om]LB[ej:B][eq:A]C[I searched a lot and find nothing very big. I count this one around 10 points but, as it lets aji, it was even less. I was L12, but it induces a white ko thread at J13. But maybe I should play it since it is one ko thread agains one and it reduces some white aji in the upper black group? Finally I think a move around D4 or E3 would be a big ko thread but I was afraid of a counter-move letting me gote.

F: This move is not a big threat. I would play 'A' threatening to seperate White or 'B' threatening to cut off the white stones.
But in this game anything what increases your lead is good.]
;W[la];B[pl]C[Thanks to the ko, my center destroyed framework is resurrecting into a territory. At this point I was quite confident in my final victory because nobody have weaks groups but I have more points and a bigger central influence.]
;W[lm];B[ll];W[km];B[dp]LB[bo:C][cq:A][eq:B][js:D]C[F: This move is not good. White should simply connect at 'A'.
You can exploit the weakness with directly playing at 'B'.
Also 'C' and 'D' are quite big.];W[bp]C[I guess white was thinking it induces B5, but now I want to exploit the weakness of the 2-spaces extension between D3 and G3.

F: White should connect.];B[eq]C[The shisho is ok for me: the E4 cut does not work.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr]C[Great white is separated again.

F: Yes, very good result for you.];B[bo];W[bq]C[Definitively white B4 was a mistake since it ends gote and separated without any additional profit.

F: You are right.];B[gp]LB[fo:B][go:A][jo:C]C[Now attack the new weak white group and trying to close by above framework.

F: A contact play is rarely seen as an attack move. Moves like 'A' to 'C' are more common.]
;W[hp]C[White resists...];B[go]C[Maybe something more agressive would be better here: the crosscut at H3? or the counter-hane at H5? It looks more difficult to read for me and I guess I have enough point to win (mostly if I can close my central framework [even reduced\]).

F: You do not need to play aggressive now. You are leading, so simple moves and reducing aji is the key to win a won game.]

Black plays '1',
White plays '2',
Black plays '3';
then you should play the third move first.
Why is that?
If White would still play at '2' now, Black wouldn't answer at '1' anymore. So Black gets more flexibility. He can decide to play at 'A' or 'B' for example.
There is a cut after White '1' and Black 'A', but Black can capture and is ok.]
