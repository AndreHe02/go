C[This is a correspondance match on OGS as part of one of the weekly tournaments but it was played as a longer live game as we were both online at the same time.
It is very close at the end and I lose by 2.5.

"I think my opening could do with a bit of work. I loose the left side and take only a small amount of territory in the bottom left corner in return.
"


"There are various places where I think I made bad moves and I have commented on them and tried some variations to see where I should have played."
ANNA: Have a look at my comments and variations.

--------------------------------------------

Hello,

my name is Anna (10kyu) and I am the reviewer of your game :-).
For a 20kyu game I was impressed how good it was.

All my comments start with "ANNA:" (so you can easily identify them).

If you still have questions just leave me a message on rentao86@freenet.de.

Have fun :-)];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[lq];W[cn]LB[jd:A][cj:B]
[qj:C]C[ANNA: White C6 is totally okay. But instead of attack you can also try increase to work potential terretory with A, B or C.]
;B[jc]LB[fc:B][gc:A]C[timuzhti: Dammit. that was a shit move.
timuzhti: It'll try the low pincer this time :)
timuzhti: I'll*];W[hb]TR[fc]C[Kodey1: good game :)

===============================

ANNA: Too deep... Better try F17 or G17 (H17 leaves an invasion Point for black).
Note: Black could attack at some point at F17 or G17 (if white plays H18).]
;B[mc]C[timuzhti: Yeah.];W[ob];B[nb]C[timuzhti: I suppose I'm not valuing sente enough.]
;W[pj]TR[pb]SQ[nb][jc][mc]C[I think I should possibly have played on the left had side instead of here but then black would probably take the right side leaving me with a lot less territory and a very weak top right corner so I played here.
Was there a better place to play?
=================================

ANNA: White left a weak spot at Q18.
But increasing whites potential terretoriy on the right is correct here I think, as it lessens the influence of the upper black group.]
;B[cl]LB[cq:B]C[timuzhti: Low pincer, there we go.];W[cq];B[cp]

;B[fq];W[fr];B[gr]LB[gq:A]TR[cp][dp][eq][fq]C[timuzhti: Joseki, I think.
---------------------------------------------------
ANNA: Black G2 is mistake (White may keep this special shape of black in mind!
White should react with A.]
(;W[gs];B[hs]LB[hr:A]C[ANNA:  Black H1 is a mistake (again)... White should play at A (H2) instead of D2.]

(;W[dr];B[fs];W[es];B[gs];W[bp];B[bo]LB[bq:A]C[ANNA:  White must protect with A.]
;W[cs];B[bq];W[br]C[timuzhti: You're playing worse than before.]
;B[ap];W[ar]C[ANNA:  Not neccessary... White is already alive (these saves just some minor points... there are a lot of bigger moves on the board).]
;B[aq]C[ANNA:  Same for black.... too slow];W[gq];B[dn];W[hr]
;B[is];W[ir];B[js]C[Kodey1: yeah its quite late so im a bit tired]
;W[jr];B[hq]LB[gp:A]C[ANNA:  White should better extend with A. (Only take the stones if it is really neccessary. Before you take something, first have a look to extend something).]
;W[ks];B[kr];W[hp];B[gp];W[iq]C[timuzhti: Wheras I'm alswys playing worse.
timuzhti: And spelling bad.

;B[hc];W[ib];B[ic];W[fa]LB[cc:A][cd:B]C[ANNA:  No need to play F19.... Don't throw away sente (initiative) :-). If you really want to secure something because you are highly in the lead at the moment you may play A or B.]

(;W[bd]CR[ik]LB[dk:A]C[This was a bad move, I should have saved the stone that was just put into atari and then



I could have killed the black group and from there I would probably have won the game

;W[ia];B[tt];W[ns];B[os]C[ANNA: Nice :-)];W[ms];B[tt]C[timuzhti: This is why I don't like territory scoring.
timuzhti: Can you pass.
Kodey1: im just thinking];W[kj]C[timuzhti: I don't do that. Why do you have to do that>

At this point I was trying to play in dames so that black has to play in his own territory to try and bring blacks score down.]
;B[ig];W[tt];B[tt]C[timuzhti: So close XD
Kodey1: yeah, i was just trying to reduce down my the margin i would loose by, thats why i started to fill in neutral points
Kodey1: it forces you to play in your own territory
timuzhti: I have 3 wins now :)
Kodey1: thabks for the game :) i havent played one this close in a while
timuzhti: GG;WP
Kodey1: well played


I think I did ok on this game. I made some mistakes due to not reading far enough through a situation which caused me to give away alot of stones or not kill groups that I could easily have done at the time.

=========================================

ANNA:  For 20 kyu this game was really greate :-).
Keep on the good work and also don't forget to do some Life & Death problems from time to time :-)]
