;B[dq];W[pc];B[dc];W[qp];B[de]LB[oq:a]C[this move is strong but very defensive. Don't try to close territory at the beginning of the game, or you might be late in developping and lose at the end.

There are over alternatives. For instance Black on D3 is heading on the lower side and is asking for extension : a is an idea in that sense and is also offensive.]
;W[oq];B[qe];W[qg];B[oe]LB[pf:a][pj:b][nc:c]C[you invite W to defend on the upper side. "a" is stronger for Black, open to the outside,and make b and c miai]
;W[nd];B[ng];W[pj]C[Black is going out helping W to make territory. Maybe P10 was B opportunity]
;B[kc];W[lc]TR[ld]LB[kd:a]C[Black M16 better than L16 (variation 1)?

I don't think : if you play to much in contact you help your opponent to get stronger. It also gives W a cutting point. "a" is calm and a nice extension from the 2 B stones on the left]

(;B[kd];W[qm]TR[pm]MA[om]LB[gq:a][do:b][co:c]C[Maybe not the right moment, somewhere else can be better, where ?
Maybe not the right point, White Q7 perhaps better, or even P7 ??

Indeed, it's quit difficult for B to make a living shape in there. I would have prefer an extension on the lower side (a) or something on the left (b or c)]
;B[do];W[cj];B[cg]LB[jp:a]C[maybe a is bigger. I think C13 is submissive, little with regard to territory and not a great threat for W.]
;W[cm];B[bn]C[this also seems to me submissive];W[kq];B[hq]
;W[mp]TR[jo]MA[ko]LB[kn:a]C[Too small I think. What to to ?
Is Whit K5 or L5 better ?

Yes too small : I would play a. good extension, difficult for B to cut.]
;B[io]LB[rc:a][ib:b][kb:c][he:d][mm:e][ei:f]C[here ends the fuseki.  B has 20 (upper left) + 20 (lower left) : 40
W has 5 (upper side) + 40 (right + lower side) : 45

Note that a is big for both B and W.
W has to reduce B on the upper side. It's hard to say where is the best move. An interesting one is b (then Bc and Wd). Just try to figure it out.
B also has to reduce W on the lower right. Maybe e is right.
B can also get stronger on the upper side attacking the W 2 stones on the left (f)]
;W[bm];B[hd]TR[ic]LB[kg:a]C[Is H16 necessary at this moment ?
Can white infiltrate or reduce this claimed territory. (if yes, where ? for example on J17 ?)

See earlier. If B wants to defend, I think a is better : see big]
;W[en];B[eo];W[fn];B[fo];W[fk];B[ei];W[ej];B[di]LB[fi:a]C[a is better : think to the upper side]
;W[dj];B[fi];W[gp]TR[hn]LB[ki:a][lk:b][rc:c][nj:d][lf:e]C[Too much ? Any suggestions ? Is H6 better ?

You don't need to play there : your group is save, it's enough.  I suggest a (agressive) or b (territory oriented).
Another one is c : you force B out (d) and infiltrate is moyo on the left chasing the B stones (We) on the right (that you do not expect to kill)]
;B[go];W[hp];B[ip];W[iq];B[hr];W[ir];B[fr]C[Is black F2 indeed the best move in this territory ?

it's OK];W[hs];B[gr];W[jp];B[jo];W[ko];B[im];W[km];B[ld]LB[rc:a]
[jh:b]C[M16 is a big move for black, but is this the right time to do so ?

No, it's not big. It helps W. a or b are better];W[mc];B[me]
;W[hn]C[the fight is not there : just look at B on the upper side]
;B[ho];W[in]C[Is black 59 to 63 the right seqence of playing and was it ok for black? (and for white ?)]
;B[jm]
(;W[gn]C[Is white K6 better ?

I don't think. W ends gote ...];B[jn];W[kk];B[ik];W[gl]TR[ji]
[ki]C[Was infiltrating in Black's upper left territory better?
If yes, was white K11 possible, perhaps L11 or where else do you suggest?

YES indeed ! but too late.
I would play L11 or L12];B[hi]LB[ki:a]C[Black 65 is to defensive (I suppose)

a was better I think];W[kn];B[ki];W[mj];B[ni];W[nj];B[mi];W[oi]

(;W[rf]TR[nf]C[Was White O 14 possible ?

Yes possible, but not very useful : it's gote];B[qc];W[pb];B[re]

(;W[od]TR[ne]LB[bh:a][bo:b]C[Was White O15 possible ? (To cut the upper right black stones ?)

yes, you could try but as an endgame move : a or b are bigger.]
;B[ne];W[lb];B[kb];W[bo];B[cn]LB[bp:a]C[maybe a was good also]
;W[an];B[bp]C[Isn't there another possibility to invade in black territory ?

Don't ask too much !]
(;W[co];B[cp]C[Was it ok to give up those two black stones?

Yes I think so];W[dn];B[bi];W[bj];B[qf];W[sg];B[pg]
(;W[ec]LB[bh:a][ka:b][ra:c][jj:d][ap:e]C[Very important question to me !

Is this the right invadation point, how can white live in black's moyo ?

Pls give some variations or advise about this position for white.

I don't think there is any way to invade for W. Just play a, b, c, d or e to reduce B. These are quite big.]
;B[db]LB[ed:a]C[good, quiet answer. Maybe a was also good];W[ed]
;B[dd];W[ge];B[gd];W[fe];B[kl]C[why ? it's gote, and gives nothing]
;W[ll];B[jl];W[gh];B[gi];W[fh];B[eg];W[fg];B[hh];W[hg];B[ig]
;W[hf]C[Now white gets 1 eye. Is there a way for black to avoid this ? (perhaps by playing B119 on H14)

Yes but it's not a problem : one eye is dead. Go back to B and play F13 for instance]

a was possible];W[jj];B[ij];W[ji];B[lk]C[NO ! just take the W stone if you want to come there]
