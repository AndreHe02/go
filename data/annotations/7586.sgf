C[Hi,

in this game I was Black and lost by about 10 points. I thought that things went quite well for me so I was a little surprised at the end. I suppose I lost a lot of points during the middle game and would like to know what went wrong for me. Especially where were the big points I missed.

Thanks
Stefan



[doitsu\]:

Hi Stefan,

I will try my best to review your game. Keep in mind that I am no pro and may be wrong with my suggestions. Of course I hope you will enjoy my review :)

In my opinion there are two situations which are particularly odd. The one is the fight on the left side (move 37 -  I would have taken white the possibility to extend instead of pushing out further). You already commented by yourself that the white extension would have been blacks point to play - you did a good observation there.

Another thing are moves like 75 which miss a strategic aspect from my point of view - I will of course explain things there.]

;B[pp]LB[cf:A]C[[doitsu\]: Eidogo says 'A' is an important point here. But I can understand that you take the other corner here.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[cn];W[cl]C[After my kakari I wanted to connect to the upper left corner to start a moyo. As he pincered me I tried to use a sequence to push him up, so afterwards I could extend from the upper corner to attack.


[doitsu\]: Try out C7 when you have something like this in mind. This may be a wrong move here (I am not sure), but I bet you will enjoy to experiment with this move in other games.]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[dm];W[ck]LB[fq:A]C[[doitsu\]:
It is hard to tell for me whether your kakari at 'A' is so bad.]
;B[fq]C[I guess this was against my plan. C12 or so would have been more consistent.]
(;W[fk];B[fl]LB[ch:D][fl:E][eo:B][cq:A][iq:C]C[[doitsu\]:

I don't believe 'E' is so good here. I guess your intention was not to get shut in, as 'E' is not such a strong attack. But 'B' also does a good job in this issue and has some other purposes too, as it strongly attacks/shuts in the corner.

'The purpose of 'A' is clear I think.

'C' saves one group and has a nice little side effect to the group at O2, when black plays R2.

'D' makes territory and makes D9 a weak group, but black will have two groups to struggle with then.]
;W[fp];B[dq];W[cq];B[cp];W[eq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[gq];B[do]
;W[eo]LB[ck:A]C[[doitsu\]:

I think black is alive in the corner, its time to attack 'A now. I don't think 37 is a good move. (but 38 isn't either)]
;B[en];W[fn];B[fm];W[gn];B[gk]LB[mc:A][qf:C][qj:B]C[With the corner group basically shut in, there must have been bigger points, around the top right corner. If I had chosen to play on the right, what would you consider to be the right place? Q10 or more towards the corner?

[doitsu\]:

Keep in mind I am no pro, but I like 'A' or O17 for black :) You know there is this proverb "play away from thickness". So black has quite a stable group down right and white is stable in the upper left, he might want to approach the upper right corner from the top side, 'A' prevents this.
An invasion at 'B' would suffer from narrow space and a kakari at 'C' can be pincered... but of course Q10 has balance.

You said by yourself that the weak group at C9 has to be attacked, so this still is the key point.]
;W[ch]C[This seems to be the point I had to play.

[doitsu\]: I think so, yes.];B[fj];W[ej];B[fi]C[I wanted to get some outward influence with this sequence.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[di]SQ[ei][fi]C[[doitsu\]:
Moves like this are no real threat, they just force the enemy to respond, your connection 53 after this move misses this aspect - even if you would have noticed your move was not that strong, play another strong move (q10 f.e. would be far better than 53) instead of just sticking to old things. After 52 there is clearly no life and death question here anymore, and your "wall" at D11 E11 and F11 do not form anything of great value at this point of the game.]
;W[ci];B[ei];W[dj]C[[doitsu\]: Bad];B[ek]LB[ne:B][eg:A][no:C]
C[[doitsu\]:

Bad.

Even if white connects (to form a perfect dango) black can still connect his few stones to the corner at 'A'. But generally the points at 'B' and 'C' are far more valuable then "attacking" white, who is quite alive I think. If white and black get rid of sequences like this in their games, both would be 4 stones stronger.]
;W[gg];B[eg]LB[cb:B][cf:A][eg:D][ei:C]C[[doitsu\]: Bad. If this move is about corner stability play 'A' or 'B'. The stones at 'C' don't need to be saved, as they already are connected, and a white separation at 'D' need not be feared when the corner is stable. A white "connection" also is no point of interest, as the groups he would connect are both already stable.]
;W[cf];B[ce];W[be];B[bd];W[bf];B[oj]C[I guess this had to be on the fourth line.

[doitsu\]: mh.. but I think its ok to play such moves if you feel to do so. It is not that absurd to play moves like this sometimes. White is likely to get a weak group after an invasion and if you have hunting plans which seem fruitful to you, then do so. P10 has in my eyes much more virtue to it that the moves I criticized earlier.]
;W[qh];B[qj];W[oh];B[mi];W[ng]LB[ne:A]C[[doitsu\]: I think 'A' would be nice. My variation is just an idea :) With corner groups like this you have to be careful as R18 can be quite nasty sometimes.]
(;B[mg];W[nf];B[nd]C[I tried to attack his group to profit on the outside; especially towards the bottom. I think instead to attacking here I could have enlarged my bottom right moyo, with o5 or so.

[doitsu\]: You have a very good feeling for tactic. I think this is the right way of thinking here.]
;W[mf];B[lg];W[jg];B[ji]LB[md:A][kf:B][no:C]C[[doitsu\]: I think 'A', 'B' or 'C' would be far more valuable.

'C' is clear, but 'A' is double purpose, as it threatens to shut in O17 and P12.

Even if white moves out at K11 he will take no territory there and your moyo is incomplete without 'C' - after all 'C' is also a big point for white.]
;W[im];B[mo]C[Too loose?

[doitsu\]: I think its playable.];W[ko];B[lm];W[no];B[nn];W[mp]
;B[oo];W[km];B[kf]C[[doitsu\]: Good.];W[jf];B[ke];W[md]LB[jd:A]
C[[doitsu\]: Here is the question how much you trust your corner. If you have no "life and death"-fear here play 'A'.  'A' is a huge spot, even if played after the corner exchange.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[qb];W[mb];B[kl];W[kn];B[ln]C[[doitsu\]: I don't see the importance of this move...]
;W[ih];B[ii];W[fe];B[pg];W[ph];B[rh];W[jl];B[kk];W[jk];B[np]
;W[oq];B[nh];W[og];B[pf];W[ne];B[od];W[je]C[[doitsu\]:

Compare the last two moves of white and black.
Give him the stone he ataried and "wormhole" his upper side instead - your group on the upper right is safe.

I think the basic thing is: you should think about life and death more often than about connections or territory (or single stones ;). It does not make sense connecting, when there is no danger in getting separated (E13). It was not that important to try to move out with your group in the lower left side, as the group was already quite stable. White was not stable there for quite a long time and I think you should have made things difficult for him - especially because you could have taken territory with this attack, too. You definitely know something about strategy, but your moves too often just cover one aspect of it - I think you will improve fast, when you get away from simple faults like 95, 37 or rather "un-strong" moves like 75 and get to hunt groups like Q12more often - an idea of yours in this game which I do like very much - I think you can improve your technique there too, but you had multiple ideas there to make profit, f.e.

1. The threat of shutting in and killing
2. Build your wall and take territory
3. Drive a  thorn into your enemies territory


I hope you enjoyed the review - don't take my "Bad" comments too serious - I really like your style :)

Now both 'A' and 'B' are weak. I think none of them can be shut in immediately, but white will have to do something about 'C'. Personally i don't like this outcome so much, because the moyo on the upper left is very fruitful for black. W making territory there is just a thorn.]
