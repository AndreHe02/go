C[Hello Reviewer, please let me introduce first :)
My name is Sergei Richter, I'm living in Germany. The first thing I want to mention is that my English is (as you can see^^) very bad, so i just want to say that any kind of arrogance or insults towards you weren't planned. I'm very thankful that you take the time to review my game :)

So, back to the game. I'm black (Sergei1985), my opponent is the white guy. My gaming is level is probably around a-billion-kyu because i started only a few days ago to play this game. If i have any questions, I will ask them you at the move. So that was all :) Maybe you are enyoing this game ^^

Have fun and thank you!];B[pd];W[ep]C[Play normally starts by grabbing the corners. The W move at 5-4 is too far from the corner to secure the corner territory.]
;B[pp];W[ee]C[W at 5-5 is too far away from the edges to secure corner territory.]
;B[pj];W[fj]C[Once the corners have been played, the edges are the next place to make the biggest territory. W on 6th line is playing too far away from the edge. Normally either the 4th or 3rd line.]
;B[jd];W[ko];B[mp]C[Excellent play by B so far.];W[kq];B[gd]
C[@Reviewer: Well here was my first real problem. What to do with the two stones at L3-L5? I've decided to attack by myself, but whats the best counter to them? It's sounds maybe silly, but somehow i'm afraid of them cause i don't want that the white guy gets to strong at the center so i didn't want just to build up a wall. But every time I attacking such an formation i ended getting double-atari so i lose stone for stone.]
;W[hf];B[lr]C[Good. It's usually a good idea to make sure the opponent doesn't have stones below your borders to protect from invasions into territory you're trying to make.]
;W[mo];B[no]LB[np:1]C[Playing at 1 is better defensively as it connects stones (makes more liberties) and doesn't create cutting points. Allows you to play without concern in other bigger points on the board later.]

;W[li];B[mi];W[lh]LB[ng:1]C[@Reviewer: Since i had not much experience with ladders, this was a bad one as i recognized later. Anyway, what other, safer, options do I have besides playing such a ladder? I'm sure there is a way to catch up the stones in the middle but i don't see it.

Don't try to kill the stones. Instead play farther away from them and make a loose border around it that can be closed up as W gets closer to it. Playing at 1 is a good start. Even if W captures the stone at L11, W will likely die in the end.]

;W[og];B[qd]LB[rd:1]C[Playing at 1 would be a little better, as it closes off the top corner from W extending into it.]
;W[rf];B[rd]C[Playing here last move would have saved one move and allow you to play elsewhere and get one move ahead of W in points.]
;W[se];B[rh];W[rg];B[ph]LB[qi:1]TR[rh][ni][pj]C[This play is too close. Should play a bit away from W to just make a wall connecting the marked stones. 1 is a direct way to do this, securing the area on the right edge.]
;W[qh];B[oi];W[pi];B[qi];W[ri];B[ph];W[sh];B[pi]LB[rj:1]C[Playing 1 is more important to stop W from creeping all the way down the side. If W captures Q12 later, B can respond by filling at R10 and there's no more concern.]
;W[qj];B[rj];W[qk]C[@Reviewer: I have big trouble in situations like that. If both players ends up at the side of the board, it is every time me who have the worse position. An easy advice how to handle with those situations would help me a lot!!

Don't make contact plays where the played stone touches an opponents stone. Instead, play one line away from them and build a wall that will keep the territory protected.]
;B[rk];W[rl];B[ql]C[@Reviewer: Here I am again :) A Unit of 2 Stones, only one liberty with a lot of black stones around which supports me. But, somehow, I didn't catch him. Any ideas to do it better?]
;W[pk];B[ok]LB[rm:1]C[Here you can see that when W extends to escape atari it causes B to become in atari.

A simple way out here is to play at S7 (instead of the move played) to ensure that S8 can be captured keeping Black's stones alive.]

;W[fi];B[tt];W[jl];B[tt]C[@Reviewer: Last question: I've lost only by 0.5 moku. After the game i considered it would be maybe better to play a stone in the white section, maybe H4 or J5. Of course this stone wouldn't survive, but on the other hand, the white guy can't just ignore it since there is still (theoretical, if he let me do) enough space to create an eye or two. But... if i set only one stone he needs 4 to surround him, so he have lost 3 moku and so on. This is question about the rules. For example the white guy kills my stones at J9 and E12, although they were already dead (or?), so he lost atleast 2 points only for finishing the surrounding of them. Can it be true, that sometimes playing stones in the are of the enemy could be ends up in a better result even if it is sure that the stones get catched?

If W plays one stone in his own area to defend against each invading B stone that will eventually die, the the score is unchanged. W gains one point for each B stone played that dies, and loses one point for each W stone played in own area.]

At least, can you maybe give me some general hints besides the game "tactics" (i.e. how to learn or nice webpages), this would be very nice.

So, at last: I want to thank you one time more just for taking the time to watch my game and for the help!!!

Best advice is play many games quickly. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. Playing many games will help you learn the most.

Watch games played by other players several ranks higher. You will learn some good typical moves and responses and build a better instinct.

Good game. Have fun.])
