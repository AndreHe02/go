C[R: I'm white in this game and I sorta muddled my way through.

I think the game was fairly even until my mistake at the end. My biggest problem in this game was that I never really knew where to play. No sense of direction and urgency and therefor never getting a clear lead.

Your advice and recommendation will be appreciated!];B[pp];W[qd]
;B[dq];W[cd];B[co]
(;W[iq]LB[jq:A]C[N: Up to this move the opening is pretty standard, but this move is usually at A. See the variation]
;B[kq];W[fq]C[R: This became problematic rightaway, needing alot of moves to settle.]
;B[ko]
(;W[dr]C[N: I agree that something needs to be done here, but I don't like this move. It makes B too strong in the corner, doesn't make a lot of territorry and is gote for you. I would rather go out into the center.]
;B[cr];W[er];B[cl];W[qn];B[qp]
(;W[qk]C[N: Overall this seems a bit low, all your moves are on the third line. Of course this can work too and is a matter of style/taste too, but I would try to build something on a larger scale]
;B[mp]C[N: Too passive, I think];W[od];B[ec]C[R: Here I feel I played a good sequence up to M17.

N: I would tend to play a pincer right away. Of course there are many possibilities and it is hard to tell which is the best. If you look at any joseki dictionary, this starting position will probably make up the thickest part of the book... But for one possible way see the variation]

(;W[dc]C[N: This is considered a good move if you already have stone around the star point. However, in this case, I think it makes it a bit easy for B to settle.]
;B[ed];W[cf]C[N:];B[ic];W[lc];B[qi]C[N: I think B has better moves to reduce the W territorry here.]
;W[qg]C[R: Good pincer ?

N: Seems like the only move here];B[pi];W[ok];B[ni]
(;W[og]C[R: probably not so great should have defended Q8

N: I agree that this move is not so good. One possibility would be to play a forcing move from that direction and the attack from the other side]
;B[pl]C[R: Or may be play Q9 and give up R6.

N: Definitely better to connect the other way here]
(;W[ql];B[pk];W[pm];B[ol];W[om];B[oj];W[nl];B[nk]C[R: B settled and my group is weak]
;W[nm];B[rm]
(;W[qm]C[R: played too fast.

N: Yes, you could resist a little more here...];B[rn];W[km]
;B[jm];W[kl];B[jl]
(;W[qo]C[N: I don't like this strategy here. Better to just get out into the open. If you are going to make eyes locally, i like the variation better]
;B[ro];W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[no];W[jr]C[N: I don't get this move. Do you think everything is ok with the group in the center? B should ignore this move and attack the center group.]

(;B[kr];W[kn];B[jn];W[io]C[N: I don't like this move very much, I don't think it does very much for you. On the other hand, B wants to connect there anyway, and W forces him to. looks like a "thank you move" to me]
;B[jo];W[rj];B[qj]C[R: B allows me to hook up.

N: yes, very nice of B. I don't know why he is worried about eyes]
;W[ri]C[N: This is pretty nice of];B[rl];W[rk];B[qh];W[rg];B[rh]
;W[sh];B[pg];W[pf];B[ph];W[mg];B[fo]C[R: that hurt

N: are you sure this is sente? seems pretty hard to kill that group]

(;W[gp];B[go]C[N: now this for sure is not sente. just play the big moves.]

(;W[ho];B[ci]C[and hurt that too.];W[ei];B[dj];W[fj];B[el];W[gb]
C[N: good, although B let you get away with it pretty easily]

N: yes, save the liberties for later];B[fd];W[gf];B[hf];W[gh]
;B[hg];W[fh];B[hh]C[R: b connects and now w needs to live

N: See the variation for the easy way to live...]
(;W[hi];B[ii];W[hj];B[ij];W[jg]C[N: pretty risky strategy, did you read out the capturing race here?]

(;B[jh];W[ig];B[ih];W[ie];B[he];W[id]C[N: up until here i can sort of understand why black answers, but now he has to attack the W group for sure]

(;B[hc]
(;W[eg]C[N: as i showed in earlier variation, better to capture those stones...]

C[N: all groups settled now, only endgame left now. Thanks to the upper right it does not look bad for W, pretty close game now.]

;B[oh];W[of];B[kc]C[N: When opponent play moves like this you should aways check very carefully what he is up to, usually they have a good reason for playing them :)]
;W[ek];B[dk];W[ag];B[ah];W[ka]C[and again];B[ja]C[R: now L15 will hurt but I missed it.

N: looks like B missed it up till now too, the previous few moves were only one point, he should have played there long ago]
;W[ga];B[kf];W[lf]C[M15 would have been better..or less worse]
;B[ld];W[md];B[le];W[mc];B[me];W[mf];B[ne];W[oe];B[nd];W[nc]
;B[kg]C[R: B is well ahead and wins. I feel however even though I was ahead before L15 I made alot of wrong decisions never really getting a clear lead.

N: Right, this is where you lost the game.
No more comments in the endgame

I think in general your opening was very low, you went for secure territorry very quickly, allowing your opponent to take a lot of influence in the center. 

On another general note, I think you could benefit from reading more carefully whether a response is actually necessary. A good exaple for this is move 76. If your opponent makes a move that appears to be sente, take the time to see how much damage he can actually do. If your group still survives and you only lose a few points, this is the time to take the initiative and make a bigger move! I think your opponent was even more guilty of this and missed out on a few good opportunities for tenuki...

Hope my commentary was helpful to you, feel free to send me any follow-up questions.]
