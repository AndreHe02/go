C[hello, my name is Kevin, I hope you find this helpful.];B[qd]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de]LB[pp:B][pd:A]C[This may not be the best time to make a high approach. You've elected to play a territorial game (which is good), so your approach would be better on the third line.

 If your stones were high at A & B, then you would have a little more reason to play high. Alternatively, if the lower left was a black stone that might help as well.]

(;W[fc]C[Your opponent played very soft here and it worked out for you.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ch]C[This worked out well for you.]
;W[oc]LB[qo:A]C[This is a bad white approach. He is already low along the top. The better approach would be the lower right corner A.]

(;B[ld]C[There is no need for this. Your opponent has a low position at the top. This is a "I can't give my opponent any territory at all move". see the variation]
;W[of];B[qg];W[jd];B[mf];W[pe];B[qe];W[oh];B[pi];W[oi]
(;B[lh]C[Your two stones aren't in serious danger. If your opponent wants to push you along the fourth line be happy and take it!]

(;B[qf]C[The variation adds points in your endgame.];W[qo];B[pc]
;W[pb];B[oe]C[backpacker [9k\]: looking for a way to exploit his bad shape?

But you came out ahead because of his bad play.]
(;W[ne];B[od];W[nd];B[pd];W[nc];B[nf]C[backpacker [9k\]: solves some of my problems.]
;W[qb];B[kc]LB[ni:A]C[backpacker [9k\]: I don't want him to take the upper side, and I was hoping for a response.

You should have played the cut at A. With all those stones connected you have absolutely no weakness, and can attack just about anywhere you feel like.

L17 is an overzealous, don't let my opponent get any territory at all move. Remember, you only need to win by 0.5 points.]
;W[po]LB[mi:B]C[White B would have kept you with three seperate groups. Although none are in serious danger, having to think about three groups compared to one changes your ability to attack.]

(;B[nk]C[backpacker [9k\]: I am wondering if I should have played in the lower right corner, but I am unsure about the safety of this group

No, this is better.];W[nq];B[op];W[oo];B[np];W[lq]
(;B[mp];W[mq];B[rq]C[This does nothing, see the following white variation.]

(;B[cg]C[I believe the variation might be a better connection, removes D14 as a forcing move.]
;W[df];B[cf];W[ee];B[di];W[ei];B[ej];W[fi]
(;B[fj]C[backpacker [9k\]: I think this exchange was bad for white since he has bad shape with his 3 stones on the D line.

Yes, but the variation is better. It removes bad aji from you, and just solidifies your two groups.]
;W[gj];B[gi];W[fg]
(;B[gh]C[Overall, you played well, but as with many kyu players (including myself) greed is a downfall. Too many times you wanted just a little more, when the stronger and better move was to strengthen or unite your existing group.

I hope this was helpful.

Best Regards,

Kevin

(;B[hi]MA[dj][gj]C[backpacker [9k\]: maybe this would be less greedy, and better.  Threatening to take the cutting stone with a ladder.

Yes, you have a good lead, and it lessens the aji of the two white stones.]

(;B[dl]C[backpacker [9k\]: this does not seem too appealing.  I will try to envelope him since I am strong in the center with the M12 stone being alive.

I didn't like the shape of this either, but it is the best move. It strengthens a weak group and puts pressure on white.]
