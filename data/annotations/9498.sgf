AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, I'm Elom 7kyu and I'll mark my inquires with Elom:

Elom: I feel that I had no clue about what was going on in this game whatsoever. I feel I was outplayed in the opening, as my positional judgement is poor. Afterwards, I struggle to find out what I really, did wrong, which worries me. Please point out any blindspots I may have, Thank you very much for reviewing my game !


T : Hi, I'm Tilwen, and I'll help you review your game, my comments will start with T. I think what you mostly missed in this game was to take care about your own groups. There were a lot of fights and unfortunately you had too many separated groups and eventually you were not able to save them all.]
;W[cd];B[pp];W[ec];B[nc];W[cn];B[fq];W[en];B[dc]C[T : why this move ?]
;W[dd];B[eb];W[di]C[T : Now white has time to make a nice framework, and your two stones up there seem to be wasted.]
;B[fc];W[qj];B[qh]C[Elom: should this be at R8 instead?

T : Well, why not here ?];W[qn];B[nq];W[jq]
(;B[bo]C[Elom: Is this move playable at all ?

T : What I don't like in this move is that you allow white to enclose you, and this is rarely a good idea. K3 stone isn't settled yet, so you should probably move out into the center and aim at attacking it.]
;W[bn];B[ed]LB[bn:2][bo:1]C[Elom: Is this move okay after the 1-2 exchange?

T : capturing here seems big ...];W[ee]C[T : but now you should hane, reduce white's moyo while expanding yours.]
;B[ql]
(;W[on];B[fe]C[Elom: I'm not sure about this move.

T : what is strange is to play in different area like this and not settling anything. Why not, but you must be aware of all the differents possibilities on the board, it's an harder game.]
;W[ef];B[dm]C[Elom: By this point I had absolutely no clue of what to do and just played here, but I think it might be an overplay.]
;W[dn];B[ei];W[ej];B[eg];W[dg];B[dh];W[ch];B[eh];W[cf];B[dj]
;W[ci];B[ek];W[fj]C[T : this atari made your own stones weak.]
;B[gh]C[T : white was strong in the left area, and it was about time to try to reduce it, or invade. But in this kind of situation you must be flexible, and often cannot hope to save every stone you play. We call this play light. Right here you are trying hard to defend both your groups, this will be hard for you, white will have an easy way of playing.]
;W[fk];B[fm]C[Elom: Looks to me like an unsatifactory result for black.


T : look at how many stones white had in the first place here !]
;W[el];B[em];W[dl];B[cl]C[Elom: This is probably a mistake.]
;W[fl]C[Elom: I was lucky.];B[cm];W[ck];B[fn]C[T : to me this is quite a good result for back, white endangered his own stones, and both your group have room to escape.]
;W[ep];B[fp]C[T : I would connect at E3 instead, to make the corner strong, then you will be able to defend your center group. With your move, white can steal the corner and get a safe group, it will be only your two groups that stay.]
;W[fo];B[go];W[eo];B[hp]
(;W[co];B[eq];W[cp];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[br];B[bs]C[Elom: Could I have killed at B4? I think so.


T : white can link at B8, then black cannot kill.];W[bm];B[bl]
;W[ao];B[mo];W[jo];B[km]C[Elom: Is this move bad?



T : depends how you want to handle the G6 cut ...];W[gn];B[gm]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[in];B[im];W[jm];B[jl];W[jn]
(;B[kl];W[lo];B[mn];W[mq];B[kp]C[T : remember this important principle : you can't kill a group if it's not enclosed. Then, to attack white you must be sure that he can't go out first. Here for instance, what about N4 or N2 instead ? If L4 gets lost, it is almost a wasted move. Moreover your own lower group is far from safe : you must defend your groups before attacking your opponent's.]
;W[mp];B[ko];W[kq];B[jp];W[ip];B[iq];W[kn];B[io];W[lp];B[ip]
;W[ln];B[mm];W[np]C[T : white is connected, L4 was too early, and saving it was a loss of time.]
;B[oq];W[oo];B[ol];W[lm];B[ml];W[qq]C[T : You should be aware of the possible cuts atM8 and J8. If you do'nt defend them now or soon, they will cost you later.]

(;B[rn];W[qp]C[Elom: I expected white to play at R4.];B[po]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[pm];B[qm];W[pq];B[qe]C[Elom: Is this correct place to defend, or is the upper side more important?


T : upper side looks wider, so maybe it's a better spot to aim at. You already played Q16 and R12 in this area, white would have troubles invading. But i can't say R15 is bad.]
;W[jc];B[je];W[ld];B[le];W[nd];B[oc];W[me];B[kd];W[kc];B[lc]
;W[md];B[lb];W[ie];B[lf];W[ff]C[Elom: I think my handling of the upper side was questionable, I know I had holes in the moyo but white still seemed to live too easily.


T : when white plays here, the E12 stones are very weak, so it will be hard to defend anything...]
;B[hf]C[T : Here, if you don't know the shape, look and see that white F12 captures 4 stones.]
;W[ge];B[he];W[fd];B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[gd];B[ic];W[hg];B[gg]
;W[gf];B[if];W[ih];B[hi];W[ki];B[mi]C[T : this looks strange to me, you should defend your weak group before attacking his. J9 or something like this sems important.]
;W[ll];B[lk];W[il]
(;B[hk]C[Elom: I feel this was the game-losing mistake.];W[ik]
;B[hl];W[kk]
(;B[kj];W[jj];B[ij];W[jk];B[lj];W[ii];B[hj];W[mh]C[
Elom: Thank you very much for reviewing my game! Your help is surely greatly appreciated.

T : I hope I pointed out some mistakes you made. My advise would be this one : before playing a move, try to think why he is good or not, and try to imagine the ONE next move from the opponent. This sould help to decide why your looking-good moce is flat, or why this you-don't-know-why-but-it-seems-attractive move is really important.]

(;B[ij];W[jk];B[ig]C[T : you can connect this way.]))
(;B[ik]C[T : this looks like it's better];W[hl];B[gl];W[hk]
;B[gk];W[hj];B[gj];W[ij];B[ii];W[jk];B[kk];W[ji];B[ig]C[T : white looks like in troubles I guess.]

(;B[qp]C[T : Why not black here ? White will probably live, but you may be able to link to the outside.]
))
(;B[ln]C[T : What about connecting here ? This all depends on how your lower group can live or not.]

(;W[eq]C[T : what if white plays here ? The corner was supposed to be yours in the  first place.]

;B[fl]C[T : this is one quick idea, you moved out into the center, white G5 stones are still unsettled, and an onvasion on the left side seems promising for black.]
