C[Hello reviewer

I played black in this game and only narrowly lost.
I seemed to make most of the play and yet I still lost.
I have made some comments throughout which it might be best to read first.

Thanks,
dewdrop];B[qd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[gd]C[I know this is unusual approach but, this is common in chinese fuseki, so i thought i would give it a try.
MR: I don't think that the move is a problem. Although I got to know the move only when the corner stone is on Q17 instead of R16.]
;W[de];B[jd];W[lc];B[oc];W[jb]C[MR: This white move seems strange.]
;B[qj]C[difficult to decide to take very big point or chase white
MR: I agree. A possible continuation on the top is B M16 and if W N16 cut at N17. Black gets an outside wall, but it is a good idea to have an extension around Q10 before.]
;W[le];B[jf]C[MR: This move is ok. Another idea would be to leave the top alone once more and play E4.]
;W[eq];B[ck]C[MR: I would not want to give white the extension to C11. I would prefer C13.]
;W[ci];B[cn];W[ei]C[MR: Now black has two weak groups on the left side. If white manages to chase black with M13 etc., he can easily invade the black moyo on the right side afterwards.]
;B[en];W[lg];B[gf];W[qf];B[qh]C[MR: Leaving the area alone and playing e.g. O3 would be an alternative.]
;W[of];B[jp];W[hq];B[pn]C[odd looking game so far];W[nq];B[oq]
C[MR: As white is leading in territory, black cannot afford to give the corner to white. However, the black stone K4 will be in a strange place afterwards ...]
;W[np];B[nr];W[mr];B[or];W[kq]C[MR: This is a strange white move, as it does not connect (rather invites black to hold the white stones seperately), does not really help to run away and leaves the aji of M2.]
;B[jq];W[kp];B[jo];W[ln];B[gp]C[MR: This move mainly helps white to defend his territory.]
;W[gq];B[ho]C[MR: If you want to play here, you should do it without the exchange  B G4, W G3.]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[eo];B[fn];W[ql];B[rn]C[MR: My first impulse is to play Q8. In the variations I tried white did not manage to live on the side, but I cannot promise that there is no variation for white ...]
;W[ri];B[qi];W[rj];B[qk];W[rk];B[pl];W[qm];B[qn];W[rh];B[pm]
C[MR: Black gave away most of his side territory without true compensation ...]
;W[rl]C[MR: Unimportant.];B[qg];W[rg];B[re]C[i got sente so was happy
MR: But you only got sente because white answered at S8. White could have used this move for either chasing the black group in the upper left (and through this making his own territory even saver) or for securing the white group in the lower left, which is open for attack around B L7.]
;W[rf];B[cd];W[ce];B[dd];W[ed];B[cc];W[ec];B[be];W[bf];B[cb]
;W[fe]C[MR: I would really like to play W B16 instead of F15, but the variations are all very complicated, so that it was probably a good idea to connect here.]
;B[bd]C[black was mybe too forecful or wrong timing, i dont know but fealt this was what decided the game
MR: Black needs to live in the corner now and hope for the best for his center stones. By the corner invasion, black has managed to reduce the white territory, which was really necessary after white had reduced the black territory on the right side.]
;W[ge]C[MR: White is taking small profit while allowing black to escape with the larger part of his group. White could think of attacking the black group as a whole, but there is, of course, the danger of getting nothing.]
;B[he];W[hd];B[ie];W[hc];B[jh];W[ig];B[jg];W[hh];B[gh]C[MR: In my opinion, black should simply run away with K10.]
;W[gg];B[hf];W[hg];B[hi];W[fh];B[gi];W[ff];B[ih]C[k10 mybe?
MR: The last 8 moves were small and unimportant. So one should skip them and play K10 directly.]
;W[ek]C[MR: The white idea is and should be not to allow black to surround teritory with F10 or similar moves.]
;B[gk]C[MR: What is the goal of this move? Running away would be better achieved with K9, as this leaves less room for the white group on the lower right.]
;W[ll];B[kk]C[MR: e.g., this move could be better usde at M10 if there would already be a stone at K9.]
;W[jm];B[im]C[MR: Again, what is the meaning of this move?]
;W[jl];B[il];W[jk];B[lh];W[kj];B[jj];W[lj]C[MR: Over the last maybe 15 moves, white has more or less managed to live, while black has scattered some stones in the center which achieve nearly nothing.]
;B[bo]C[MR: Ok, it is a good idea to turn to the idea of surrounding / destroying territory again :-)]
;W[bp];B[nn];W[no];B[nj]C[MR: "There is no territory in the middle". You should either really attack white groups or (better) build / destroy territory on the edges.]
;W[mi];B[mb];W[lb];B[nl];W[co];B[dl];W[dn]C[MR: B6 is better.]

(;B[os]LB[pq:B][os:A]C[obvious mistake I made.
I resigned this game because this silly mistake.

However I have shown the last yose I thought would happen in a variation and scored the game as white+2.5


I can't see anywhere where I played really bad,

My fuseki seemed about even and my invasion of top left seemed ok. But white played very patient and still won.

I look forward to your comments.

Thanks,
dewdrop

MR: I agree that the game is rather close with white being slightly ahead.
Over the last maybe 100 points, I had the feeling that both of you played rather arbitrary end game. Maybe you should start looking for larger endgame points at the edges before playing one point moves in the middle of the board.
In the middle game, I felt that your invasion on the top left turned out better than expected, while your chasing the white group in the lower right did not turn out good. One reason is that some of your moves in the middle game seemed to have no or at least only one reason, while there were good alternative moves available with two reasons (I indicated some of the moves in the commentary).

If you feel that it is difficult to spot moves with more than one meaning, one idea is to play a rengo game with a stronger player as your partner and to ask your partner to pay attention to that aspect and to give a comment after the game.]
