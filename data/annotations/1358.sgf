RE[W+Resign]

;B[qd]C[A couple of general comments:

1) You're not getting your stones to cooperate very well - see the comments on your choice of joseki in the bottom left and the way you handled White's approach move in the top right.  
2) In several cases you ended up short of liberties by walking into a hane at the head of two stones or by not capturing White stones when you had the chance.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[fq]LB[oc:a][qo:b][qk:c]C[I'd make a shimari in the top right here, e.g. 'a' (P17). Then if White approaches the bottom left you have the possibility of playing a combined extension and pincer, e.g. White 'b' (R5), Black 'c' (R9).]
;W[ip];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr]LB[kp:a][fm:b][dl:c]C[I don't like the idea of just settling the Black group here. Instead, how about taking advantage of the Black stone in the bottom right and playing a pincer around 'a' (L4), making some potential territory along the bottom edge in the process. You might want to exchange Black 'b' (F7) for White 'c' (D8) first.]
;W[cq];B[ir];W[po];B[qm]LB[qo:a]C[Tenshi: is this move bad? Maybe P4 instead?

I think this is OK. Another possibility would be to go for the corner territory by playing 'a' (R5). I don't like P4 because it aims to make territory along the bottom edge, and White's J4 stone gives him a head start in reducing that area.]
;W[oq];B[pp]C[Usually this is bad shape because your two stones will be short of liberties after White plays P4. However, it may be OK here because you have the R7 stone to connect to. You'll end up with the corner territory while White ends up with a wall facing along the bottom edge, where your J2 stone makes it difficult for White to form territory.]
;W[op];B[qo];W[jr];B[iq]LB[hr:a]C[Bad shape again, leaving your two stones short of liberties. Instead, how about pulling back solidly at 'a' (H2)?]
;W[jq];B[pn]C[Tenshi: should play h4 first, but the white will probably build a nice territory and threaten my f3 group]

;W[bd];B[ck];W[od]
(;B[dl]LB[en:a][em:b][dm:c]C[Playing the cut with Black 'a', White 'b', Black 'c' looks more interesting - see variation on the previous move.]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[dm];B[ee];W[fd];B[lc]LB[oe:a]C[This is over-aggressive - the Black pincer stone is too weak. The contact move at 'a' (P15) looks better: it allows you to build a wall that works with your stones in the lower right to turn the whole right-hand side into potential territory.]
;W[jc]C[It's still not too late to build up the right - see the variation.]

(;B[le];W[pf]C[Now White gets to walk through what could have been your area.]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[mb]C[Seems odd, as it doesn't protect the cut.]
;B[md]C[Tenshi: I should play o16 instead of n16

N16 is bad, yes: it forces White to protect his cutting point. Cutting at O16 looks a much better idea.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[oe];B[qf];W[nf]
(;B[me]LB[mf:a][pg:b][qg:c]C[This does very little for your shape. Instead, you could play the ko with 'a' (N14) or ignore the atari and play 'b' (Q13) to build up the right side.  
Correction: if you play 'b', White can cut at 'c' (R13) - see the variation on the previous move. Playing 'c' yourself looks safer.]

C[OK, that clarifies things. Lets have a look at the territory:

Black
  top right: 10 points
  bottom right: 15 points
  bottom left: 4 points
  left/centre: 28 points
  total: 57 points

White:
  top: 20 points
  left: 10 points
  bottom: 20 points
  centre/right: 5 points
  komi: 5 points?
  total: 60 points

3 points is well within the error margin of my counting, so it's anyone's game.]
;W[mn];B[nn];W[no];B[mo]LB[ko:a]C[This ends up costing points. Probably better to just play a normal reducing move such as 'a' (L5).]

;W[rg];B[qe]LB[kb:a][pg:b]C[This doesn't seem to be necessary. Playing at 'a' (L18) would undermine White's territory at the top and cut off the N18 stones, making the cut at 'b' (Q13) much more interesting.]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[pr];B[qr];W[cl];B[bk]C[Better to just capture immediately, leaving no aji and no ko threats.]
;W[bi];B[bh];W[bl];B[bj];W[bg]
(;B[ec]LB[hc:a][bf:b][kb:c]C[Tenshi: what are the best moves to attack the top white group?

I don't think you can really attack the top left White group - 'a' (H17) looks the most interesting attempt, but I think White's OK (see variation on previous move). I'd still play at 'c' (L18) to threaten the top left and cut off the top right.

One thing worth noting is that you can capture the last stone that White played by playing 'b' (B13) - White won't be able to connect it up because of a shortage of liberties.]

The variation doesn't really get anywhere either.];W[gc];B[hc]

Another possibility is to start a ko with S12. If you win this, the White stones will die.]
