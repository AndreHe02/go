;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dp];B[op]C[HC12: P4 is my frist move ,Is this move is too agressive ? Usually, I would like to play this move in the begining.

CG: This is a perfectly normal move (and seems to be the most common one in professional games).]
;W[mq];B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[ro]
(;B[rr]C[CG: This is the wrong direction. See variation for the Joseki move and possible continuations (from professional games).]
;W[sr];B[qs];W[pn];B[mp]C[HC12: I think N4 is a bad move and I have no idea to set a good shape in this joseki.

CG: The problem was black 11 - since you can't live locally, you have to move out. 
After white 14 the kosumi is no longer attractive (there is no continuation on the right side), but attaching on the weak white stone also helps white.]
;W[nq]C[CG: Actually, I think this is an overplay as you may try to resist (see variation). White should just play M4.]

(;B[np]C[CG: Following white's orders feels bad.];W[lp];B[lo]
;W[kp];B[mn];W[qj];B[qg];W[jn];B[cj];W[kc]
(;B[nc]C[CG: Wrong direction. You should play from the other side (see variation). There is stll some aji in the corner.]
;W[gc]C[CG: This looks strange. The three point extension is an option if it's a proper kakari against the top left corner, but here I'd prefer a two point extension.]
;B[cf];W[db];B[ec]C[CG: What's the idea of this move? You are actually helping white to connect ...

If you want to attack, enter at J17.];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gd]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[gb];B[he];W[id];B[ge]C[CG: This was a bad exchange for black. Black has bad shape and is is overconcentrated.]
;W[cc];B[cn]C[HC12: C6 is a very bad move for invasion ?

CG: I think C6 is a good move.];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[cl]TR[cj]
C[CG: This is too low! Correct shape is D8 or in this position maybe even E6.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[en]C[CG: Good move! Now white is clearly ahead.]
;B[om]C[CG: Too slow again. Of course your group is still weak, but by defending it allow white to repair his only weak spot. 

I would rather invade at R8 in this position (but that's risky!) or play N9.]
;W[ql]
(;B[rc]C[CG: Again too slow. 
I think in this position white can't even get a ko without some outside help (see variation). But even if there would be a ko, eliminating it is just endgame. You need to play around F8, the crucial point for both the black and white moyos.]
;W[be];B[bf];W[bd]C[CG: Too slow!];B[fk]C[HC12: Untill now I think my (White ) is ahead in the territory .

CG: Good move, now you are back in the game.];W[gm];B[hk];W[jf]
C[CG: Good move!];B[if]C[CG: You are pushing from behind and helping white. You should rather play J13 to stay ahead.]
;W[jg];B[ig];W[jh];B[ih];W[jj]C[CG: Now white could reduce your territory and is ahead again.]
;B[ij];W[jk];B[ng];W[le];B[on];W[bq];B[co]C[Please help me the fuseki , thank you .]
