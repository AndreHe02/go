C[Hello and thanks for your review. That is a KGS long game (45min each + 15 stones/5 min byo-yomi). I'm 3k and my opponent too. The game was close. I'm white (6.5 komi) and I finally win by 2.5 points. I would like to improve my yose and check if my direction of play was good. In particular, my move 64 (K12) seems to be the key move of the game and I never know how to choose such a move. But any comment is welcome :).

-Hi there, I'm SkyOverSea on KGS. It's a new account but I'm 2d. I think a lot of the moves before move 64 is the important part. You don't usually want to reach a point where you need to dive into an opponents moyo unless you made significant profit before he got such a  moyo. You definitely did not make significant profit, aha. You should have focused on keeping solid groups and not being pushed to the second line/low. The yose could have been played better but I think it was more reading errors rather than missing big moves. I know since it was a close game, it also makes it seem like looking at the yose is more important.

If you have any more questions, can email me or message me if you see me online.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq]LB[oc:B][dp:A]C[-Another way to play if you don't want black to get two shimaris.]
(;W[dp];B[oc]LB[qj:B][qk:A][ql:C]C[-I'm going to try to not talk too much about just one stone away in play. There is actually quite the difference in each move but I don't even know all of it. I don't think it's too important yet for you but it's something to know.]
(;W[qk];B[qo];W[qg]C[Was R12 better? I got the feeling that this bigger extension was ok here since black stones are not so close. But I'm sure at all.

- I don't really like this move but black won't just invade. Black is safe on both sides so he doesn't have anything to worry about and you will sooner or later need another move to make a safer base there.]
;B[jp]LB[gq:A][hq:B]C[-I think the high extension is weird for black right now.]
(;W[gq]C[Black already got 2 shimaris + a perfect extension while I only got very little. This extension is big compared to the usual F3 but it is better for invading the bottom black area latter. Is it the best move?

-I would play H3, I showed you some variations. You don't have to be scared to play so close since its a high move. He will get some influence most likely but there are many ways to reduce corner extension moyos and such.]
;B[cf];W[ch]C[-Pincer was right, it is the biggest side.];B[ef]
;W[fd];B[di];W[ci];B[dj];W[dh];B[eh];W[cj];B[dk];W[cl];B[cq]
;W[cp]C[No choice here: I can let black take b6.

-Okay, here I shall show you some ways to deal with this 3-3 invasion. You played the wrong moves at the end.]
;B[dq]LB[ep:B][bq:C][eq:A]C[-Your move was alright but just showing you another way. I prefer C in this context but your move was fine.]
(;W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[ep];W[fq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]LB[bn:A][cn:B]
(;W[bn]C[I need to protect the C5 cut (I read the first variation), but I'm unsure where is the best move. F5 seems to be ok (second variation), but I find it not so strong since it lets a lot of possibilities for black (e.g. B6).

-I cut out your variations cause I don't know why they're there aha. You absolutely need to fix this cut unless there was a life and death situation somewhere. First of all, this is the wrong move to play to fix the cut. The right move is C6.]
;B[dr]LB[bd:A][eo:B]
(;W[bd]C[I found this move very big: taking the corner while weakening the black group (D13 or E13 becomes very big now). But maybe I had to strenghten my F2 group before? It is not weak since I can E5 or K2 but it is attackable...

-No, you must fix the cut. It's even worse for you given that E5 is a easy play for black. This move does not take the corner as you think it does though it does strengthen it. All 3 of those stones are on the 4th line, black could live there in some way later maybe. E5 is not a move you could play because black would play it but K2 is. I do believe the F2 group will not die but as you can see, you are pushed down to second line. I would gladly do that as black everytime and he gets a huge moyo off a weak wall(D9).

Another thing to consider, I know you feel you're attacking black more but black needs another move to strengthen his weak wall. Fix the cut, be safe because black still needs to fix his weakness as well.]
;B[ck];W[bk];B[dl];W[cm];B[eo];W[dn]C[Maybe should I protect the F2 group first? But my stones at C4 are still important and I want not to let black connect D8 too easily.]
;B[en];W[jr];B[iq];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[gp]C[-I don't know if you see how terrible this is for white. It's really bad, aha.]
;W[lq];B[kq];W[kr];B[lp];W[mq];B[pi]C[I didn't feel good: black was getting a very big moyo at the center and I had to play many moves on the second line :-(.

-Yes he was, I don't like this move by him but I see where he's going with it of course. It's pretty obvious. I honestly don't know how to play here, I feel like R11 is still fine but hmm, I think I still prefer R11.]
;W[ri]C[I choose this move to finish the sequence in sente.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[pk];W[ql];B[pl];W[mp]C[Now I want to enter in the moyo! What is the best move? I begin with this small sente one. Maybe it is bad after all?

- I don't think it's big enough compared to the whole view of the board. But he answers so it's good for you.]
;B[lo];W[jh]C[This move seems good. But I was very unsure about it. How choose such a move? I usually overplay in such cases (even if it was not the case here).

-This is a hard situation, I can't tell you a magical move here. I can tell you if you can get capped or shut in basically with one move, then the move you played is not good. You might want to try taking advantage of the cuts at E13. I might play F12 or who knows.]
(;B[ii]C[-You're lucky black just wanted to build territory within his moyo. I could go into variations in him attacking you but it gets messy and I'm not even sure of all the ways.]
;W[ji];B[ij]C[-Black could hane.];W[kk]
(;B[jl]LB[jc:A][ih:B]C[I think black was too passive and the sequence was good for me, even if black got many points in the center. Do you think black might attack more aggressively?

-Black could definitely attack more aggressively, he could even cut you here instead.]
(;W[jc]C[I was very happy with this move which is a perfect extension according to F16 and the black shimari. It is also is in the perfect direction for K12 (even if K16 would be better to protect these stones).

-This is a lovely move in most occasions. This is not one of those. Black is going to cap you. I'm surprised he didn't. It wasn't time for you to play this because of what you did.]
(;B[gf]C[-Again, surprised.  Black could have just invaded too.]
;W[fp]C[Sente move... I was the feeling that a tesuji is possible to enter/reduce black central area.]
;B[go];W[hd]C[-You still need to protect K12.]
(;B[qm];W[rm];B[rn];W[pm];B[qn];W[oj]C[Kikashi is often bad, but it seems ok here, doesn't it?

-I wouldn't say kikashi is often bad. I would play this move as well in many situations.]
;B[pj];W[og]C[This move seem important to protect both the S11 group and the K12 group. If black plays here, it is a double attack :-(. It also attack the Q11 group.

-Definitely much needed move.];B[om];W[mc]C[Seem huge: weaken black shimari and I have now the feeling I can build something in the center now.

-This is huge for sure, gives you so much at top. Honsetly though, I could see black living top left maybe. Starting with C17. I haven't fully read it but it seems possible.]
;B[ig];W[ih];B[hh];W[jg];B[if];W[rd];B[rc];W[oe]C[Probably not the best way to attack the black shimari? But I would like to build a central moyo...

-Well you aren't attacking that shimari aha but he does leave it a bit weak later.]
;B[jf];W[kf];B[oi];W[ke];B[nh];W[lg]C[I protect the cut which also protect the K10 cut. I cannot lost the L9 stone (without compensation).]
;B[mb]LB[lb:A][nb:B]C[This move is great. Maybe I should answer it, but I don't like to play submissively.

- think you could hane from other side if you wanted to know.]
(;W[fo];B[fn];W[jk];B[ik];W[kl];B[jm];W[re]C[Even if gote, seem not so small (compared with a black move at this point) and keep presure on black top group.

-This is big.];B[fs];W[gr];B[lc]C[-This is also huge for black.]
;W[nc];B[nb];W[od];B[pc];W[ld];B[kb]
(;W[nr]C[This move is small while closing the top at K18 is huge, but since the exchange F1-G2, a black move at O2 seems problematical for me. I hesitated to play Q2 but I feel incomfortable with an answer at P2. P2 is possible but seems gote (my move at O2 is not fully sente, but if black tenuki, Q2 becomes a big sente play).

-You actually live in sente if black plays O2. Well sente in the sense that you can make blacks lower left corner a seki or ko depending on how he plays. This isnt small but top is bigger for sure.]
;B[ib];W[jb];B[ja];W[hb]C[-You must play L17 first before this.]

;W[kc];B[lb];W[sc];B[rb];W[mi];B[mh];W[lh];B[ce];W[ni]C[Probably a mistake for me since I don't read the black sequence beginning at C16 (move 169).]
;B[oh];W[nl]C[-Well O9 is the move to play here. This doesnt even gain more points than O9.]
;B[jj];W[kj];B[ok];W[km];B[kn];W[oo];B[pn];W[mn]C[-Need to play O9 here instead of this. Or play C16 which is huge as well.]
;B[nk]C[Didn't see that this move was so big. N6 was probably better at O10.]
;W[mk];B[mj];W[lj];B[nj];W[dm]C[I searched a lot, but I did not find any sequence beginning at F7 (since D4 may become short of liberties after D7. So I choose this move.]
;B[em];W[op]C[Seem small but activate some aji in the corner.

-There is  bigger moves like C16 I think right now but you do gain some from this. Just realize it took a gote move first to gain profit in corner which was actually just aji aha.]
;B[nf]C[Didn't see before that this move works :-(.];W[of];B[mf]
C[I was a bit affraid now: all my white central area is destroyed and black can capture stones when he wants at M11 and N8.]
;W[qr]C[Seem to work even if not 100% sure. Anyway I'm late and I must take risk.
