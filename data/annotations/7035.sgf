C[nebako [5k\]: hi
kommissar [5k\]: Hello

[[Hi - my name's Adam, and I played White in this game.  My comments and questions will be in double brackets.\]\]

[[I'm returning to go after some time away, and since I've started playing again, I've won slightly more than I've lost.  However, I pretty much always win by under five points, while my losses are always catastrophic.  So I feel as though I'm a bit overrated at this point.  In the game that follows, I tried to implement some of the techniques that others have used to great effect against me, but I don't really know what I'm doing, so any tips you can give would be great.\]\]

(Jantje) I am your reviewer today, and I'll start off by giving you my first impressions after playing through the game once. Then I plan to add some variations here and there and conclude --at the end of the game-- with some well-meant remarks :)
Well, first impressions. You play sound moves, but sometimes not sharp enough. Also you should perhaps keep track of the score to guide your decisions.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dd];W[pe]C[[[I don't feel like I'm very good at invasions/reductions, so I generally prefer to prevent my opponent from building up large frameworks in the first place.  I also thought this kakari would work well with Q4 and that it would therefore be a shame to pass up the chance.\]\]

(jantje) This is quite OK, not better or worse than playing in the empty corner.]
;B[qe];W[qf];B[qd]
(;W[pf]C[(jantje) Now you are really leaving 3 corners to Black. See the variation for an alternative.]

(;B[qj]C[Not such a hot idea, better to finish the joseki and take the last corner. With the whole board empty, why start fighting where White is strongest? (jantje)]
;W[oc]
(;B[qn]C[According to the books and in my experience B should play as in the variation. (jantje)]
;W[ob]C[[[I'm trying to learn to play urgent before big.  I thought I could get some sente moves in before addressing either of the bottom corners.\]\]

Good, especially your realization that White should keep sente here. (jantje)]
;B[pb];W[pd];B[rb]
(;W[dp]C[I would not allow the double kakari here (jantje)]
;B[nq]
(;W[pn]TR[qj][qn]C[[[Attach to the stronger stones, right?\]\]

I'd want to attack the marked stones, not make them safe. After all, what is the purpose of your thickness in the upper right? But I see nothing special for White here either; the variation is just a try for something better than the game (jantje)]
;B[qo]C[[[I didn't know how to deal with this.  I thought it was supposed to be a bad move.\]\]

Black's move is not so very bad. Normal response is to connect I'd guess (jantje)]

(;W[pm]C[[[I played here on the theory that Black was "supposed" to play Q7, and your opponent's good move is your good move...\]\]

This move gets full marks for imagination, but you are giving away quite a big corner! (jantje)]
;B[qp];W[qm]C[[[Now I thought cutting off R10 was the most useful thing I could accomplish from my existing position...\]\]

Yes, consistent play.];B[po];W[nn]C[[[Still thinking about R10...\]\]]
;B[oo]C[Note that the black corner is more than 20 points! Swallowing R10 might --just-- make up for it. Since Black's gain is more certain than White's, Black has done better on this transaction. (jantje)]
;W[mm]LB[oj:c][nl:a][nm:b]C[[[Still thinking about R10...\]\]

This gives Black an annoying peep at a and is therefore considered bad shape.  At b is better, and directly at c was another thought.]
;B[oj]C[[[Okay, so the fight is on.  With the positions I'd built above and below, I thought I should be able to get something out of this!  But how?\]\]

Black should move out a little faster, for example by a two points jump (niken-tobi) (jantje)]
;W[pi]C[[[I didn't want Black living easily in that space...\]\]]
;B[pj];W[mj]C[[[Nor easily running out...\]\]

Excellent combination by White (jantje).];B[oi];W[oh]C[[[One thing I've read in other reviews is that the locally strong player should play aggressively.  So I thought I'd try that.\]\]]
;B[nh];W[ni];B[ph];W[og];B[mk]LB[nl:a]C[Such fights are very very hard to play and to analyze. So far I do not find fault with either player's moves; but here Black a (O8) would have been better and difficult to answer. (jantje)]
;W[lk];B[mi];W[nj];B[om]LB[nl:a]C[Rather pointless and aji-keshi besides.  But a, though still interesting, is not so clear anymore. (jantje)]
;W[on];B[ql];W[rm];B[pl];W[qh]C[Right! (jantje)];B[qi];W[rk]
LB[rh:a]C[Better a (S12) and B is dead as far as I can see. (jantje)]
;B[rh];W[qg];B[rl];W[sl];B[rj];W[ol];B[ok]
(;W[nl];B[nk];W[lj];B[ml]C[Painful (j)];W[ll]C[Keeping Black in is the right decision, even though he lives now. (j)]
;B[nm];W[mn]C[[[Okay.  So here's a position that I'm usually on the other side of: normally I'm the one briefly relieved to have made life for my group, only to discover that in so doing I've given my opponent a strong outside position.  This time I'm the one who appears to have a pretty nice wall.\]\]

[[What on earth do I do with it?  How do I make this work for me?\]\]

Even though White has missed an opportunity to kill, the White thickness should still compensate the 30+ points that Black got from 2 corners plus side.
The way to make thickness work is to cut the opponent wherever you can. If you succeed in doing that he has to live small everywhere and you will be picking up points almost without trying (j)]
;B[jd]LB[fc:a]C[This is probably too close to your thickness.
Therefore a (F17) seems best for W now  (j)];W[lh]TR[nh]LB[mg:a]
C[[[I wanted to make sure these guys didn't combine with K16 to surround the upper half of my wall.\]\]

This amounts to saying: "Excuse me, I thought I had some thickness but now I see that it needs another move". I think that is too shy an attitude. 
A technical point is that the marked stone is the cutting stone here, to kill it off you want to play a (N13) (j)]
;B[md]LB[nd:a]C[Should be a, of course (j)];W[cf];B[ce]LB[gc:a]
C[Bad idea, makes White stronger. Better at a, to connect (j)]
;W[df];B[fd];W[dj]C[[[Trying to establish some sort of moyo.\]\]

OK (j)];B[kq];W[fq]LB[jp:a]C[For moyo purposes a move like a seems best (j)]
;B[hq];W[go]LB[hc:a]C[I am not sure of this move because it does not take territory, leaving the left side open. Another drawback is that this move is not at a :) (j)]
;B[cn]LB[hc:b][hd:a][bo:c][bp:d]C[[[Okay, here's another of my problems.  I feel like no area I've staked out is ever really safe, and no area my opponent has staked out is ever really in danger.  At this point I didn't know what to do about Black's hold on the top left, nor how to deal with this C6 invasion.\]\]

Let's be very clear about two things:
a) you haven't staked out any territory at the left side (where are the low moves that would accomplish this?) Rather, your high moves are positioned well for fighting. Your following moves are quite OK!
b) Black is WEAK at the top. An invasion at a or b will give him no end of trouble since the connection to K16 is broken. On the other hand, he can repair this in one move by playing b himself. Therefore the top is very urgent now, and whatever you do on the left you should come out with sente. The worth of your wall depends on who gets to play b!!
BTW, Black might have done better to play at c or d here, or even immediately at b. (j)]
;W[co];B[dn];W[cl];B[dl];W[dk]LB[ck:a]C[a instead is more normal (j)]
;B[cm];W[el]C[[[Here I thought I'd try for another wall to work with my existing one to try to make a big center.  I never really play this way, because when I did this as a beginner I could never find much territory in the center, yet my opponents seem to pull it off...\]\]]
;B[bl];W[dm];B[ck];W[en];B[dl];W[em];B[cj];W[di];B[ci];W[ch]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[do];W[cp];B[eo];W[fo];B[bn]C[[[Okay.  So now I have two walls and a corner... while Black has three corners and four sides.  This is getting ugly.\]\]]
;W[hc]C[[[I felt like I need to do something about Black's top side.  But what?  Is this any good?  Is H16 better?  What are the vulnerable points, and why are they vulnerable?\]\]

YES!! You found it!! 
It is not so easy to decide whether H17 or H16 is better; maybe H16 would have made things even harder for B. After H17 Black can still try to connect by playing H16 himself.
To make this absolutely clear: other moves than H16 or H17 do not come into consideration. You must split Black up! (j)]
;B[jf];W[he];B[gc]
(;W[hd]C[Not good (j)];B[ff];W[hg]TR[jd][md][jf]C[[[I wanted to keep Black's top side split about, but I was concerned I was ruining my center territory by running down into it... I kept thinking, "Gah, shouldn't my walls be preventing this somehow?"\]\]

Attacking the marked stones is White's only thought here. (j)]
;B[ig]
(;W[ih];B[jh];W[if];B[jg];W[ii];B[ji];W[jj];B[ij];W[hh]LB[gi:a]
C[Ugly, better a (j)];B[ie];W[hf];B[lf];W[mg];B[jb];W[cc]LB[hb:a]
C[Keep B separated! (a) (j)];B[cd]LB[db:b][hb:a]C[[[Unexpected.  I knew that C17 was supposed to work, but I thought Black would respond at D17 and I would connect up the left side.  It took me two minutes of frantic reading to figure out a way to make life in the corner.\]\]

White should still play at a; the standard move to make life in the corner is b. (j)]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[bd];B[be];W[bb]LB[ad:a]C[if Black plays a now, it's a ko I believe (j)]
;B[db];W[cb];B[ea];W[ac];B[ae];W[ad];B[hb];W[bh]C[[[Now I thought that having split Black's position up I should try to squeeze his groups and make each one make its own life...\]\]

You have not so much split B as allowed him to connect (at H18). Making life for the left side is easy. (j)]
;B[bi];W[lc]LB[jp:b][lq:a]C[Now that Black has connected along the upper side, this is endgame only, and gote besides. The lower side is now urgent, starting with an attachment at a or a shoulder hit at b (the idea behind a is to split, and of b, to surround center territory). Choosing between the two is difficult, to evaluate a you must read a lot; to evaluate b, counting is a useful skill :) (j)]

(;B[kc];W[mc];B[nd];W[ld];B[mf];W[od];B[nf];W[ng];B[kn]TR[hd]
[lh]LB[ke:a][km:b]C[[[Despair.  I thought that Black now had two ways to end the game for me - cutting M17, or rescuing J10.  I thought trying to prevent the latter would at least be a more active way to play.\]\]

It is certainly true that you have not made the most of your chances. The marked stones cost you a full move each and you allowed Black to connect the upper side again. But it is too early for despair
Note that there is a nice point for you at a (L15). But first you must answer Black's move at b (L7) or otherwise he will cut. (j)]
;W[jk];B[in];W[hl];B[hm];W[gm];B[il]C[[[Now I thought my only chance was to give up the defense and counterattack instead.\]\]]

;B[jr];W[ik];B[ep]LB[lm:a]C[Can't imagine why Black does not cut at a (M7) all these moves (j)]
;W[eq];B[gp];W[ho];B[fp];W[km]C[[[I was extremely surprised this move was still available.  And right this second I'm not sure why I put it off so long.\]\]

;W[np];B[op];W[ee]LB[ke:a]C[[[If you're wondering why it took me so long to play this move, it's because I didn't even notice it until just now.\]\]

And a (L15) is a similar idea, only bigger (j)];B[ed];W[fe]
;B[bg];W[dh]C[[[I was running out of time and worried that in a complicated fight I wouldn't have time to read which cutting points were vulnerable and which weren't.\]\]

That's understandable, but in the clear light of day you see that you could and should have descended A12 (j)]

[[So I was relieved to see I'd squeaked another one out.  But, again, I'd rather not rely on luck like Black missing the L2 cut.  So many thanks for any advice you might have.\]\]

Apart from the remarks at the moves, the following suggestion may be helpful:
Rely (at least) as much on the particular as you do on the general. Each game has its own truths (such as, in this game, the right side fight which should have ended in Black being killed, and the enormous importance of splitting up the upper side). In contrast, the 'universal' truths found in books should be taken with a grain of salt. Not because they are untrue, but mainly because they are in words, a clumsy medium in this case.
Put otherwise: 1. reading 2. reading 3. reading, the advice from my teacher.

Hope you enjoyed the review as much as I did (jantje)])
