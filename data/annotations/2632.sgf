C[Greetings. I was Black in this game. I need some help with my opening still. Had White played only a little more defensively, he would've had me


***** my comments in the game are preceeded by *******    overall, i think you did a nice job.   here are my overall comments:
1) one of the hardest things for me to learn was to keep my head up.  i used to get shut into corners and sides all the time and the next thing i  knew, i couldn't get into the center at all.  you will see what i mean when you read my comments.

2) watch for big endgame moves where you can jump into his territory and take away large pieces.

3) unfortunately, this is not the best game for teaching you about openings.  hopefully i have shown you a few things about approaches and direction in opening.  if you want more advice about the opening, feel free to send me a game with a more conventional opening and i will review it for you.]
;B[qd];W[pd]C[This worried me which is probably why I reacted badly]
;B[pc];W[od];B[qb];W[nc];B[ob]LB[pf:a]C[***** given the situation, this move is in the wrong direction.  You already have a good base for your stones, and this move will not enable you to get into his territory since he will probably just block at O18.  Instead, a play at A would be nice development and prepare for taking the bottom right corner.]
;W[nb];B[pp];W[pn];B[dc];W[fd];B[fc]LB[de:a]C[****** i see what you are trying to do here, but I think i would suggest a play at A to take the corner.  a play at A would both take the corner and threaten to jump into his upper side.  at this point, his upper side is too open to be much concern.  a play at k16 would break up the top if you are worried about it, but that should be done a bit later.]
;W[gc];B[fb];W[oq];B[pq]LB[op:a][pf:b]C[***** you essentially had two choices for this move.  Here, and at A.  give the whole board situation, i think playing at A would be better.  there are two reasons.  first, the play you made will probably get you sealed into the corner.  white is obviously going for outward influence and he is trying to seal you in whereever he can.  second, by building a wall with a play at A that faces up the right side, the Q6 stone begins to look very lonely and without any friends.  you still have the play at B and the right side looks like a nice place for b to develop.]
;W[op];B[or];W[nr];B[pr];W[mq];B[pf]LB[ro:a]C[I wanted to expand a base before going after the last corner. As zeralous as he was, I didn't think he would bother


***** before playing here, you need to secure the bottom right corner.  otherwise, a w play at A might give you some trouble, but would certainly seal you in even more.]
;W[of];B[ph];W[pi];B[rh]LB[qi:a][og:b]C[Very weak I know, but I was worried about my base. Had he cut under me, he could'veclaimed the whole right side with barely a fight

****** this is not entirely true.  it would be difficult for him to take away your base.  furthermore, if you are worried about that, i think a play at A would be better.  however, what you need to focus on right now, at this point in the opening, is that he is sealing you into the corners in an effort to develop overwhelming outward influence.  so, globally i think it is more important to "keep your head up" and prevent these big walls from forming.  to that end, i think a play at B would be in order.]
;W[dp]C[This surprised me, as I didn't expect him to let up the assualt]
;B[fq]C[***** you have several choices for this move.  i think, given his playing style, that you should expect a pincer for any low approach move to this stone.  so, i would personally consider approaching from the other direction.  my plan would be that if he played a one-space pincer, to jump out and start a running battle and quickly play a counter pincer.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[fo]C[Is this a thank you move or is this actually threatening

***** i think this whole sequence is a bit strange given his style up to this point.  but, i don't see the threat here, i think we can consider this a thank you move.  the only thing is that i would only extend two spaces instead of the normal three because this stone does give a bit more weight to an invasion into a three-space extension.]
;B[jq]C[Raziel: You're very aggresaive];W[ep];B[er];W[hp]C[******* again, this move is an attempt to seal you in.]
;B[hq]C[Again very weak, but I didn't think a counter pincer would work because of F5]
;W[dr];B[gr];W[kq]LB[ip:a]C[***** as i've said before, i think you are a bit too concerned with ensuring a base and you are not developing into the center enough.  if you look at the board, with just a few plays, he could have you completely locked out of the center.  for this reason, i think you should play at A instead of the play you make next.]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[kp];W[lq];B[jr];W[ip]C[**** instead of this, white should directly cut if s/he wants to seal you in.]
;B[iq]C[***** unfortunately, this is a wasted move.  if w pushes down, you still have two eyes because of the G2 stone.  you should have connected at K4.]
;W[jp];B[gp]C[Probably pointless, but I'm incredibly paranoid about making life

***** i understand your fear, but, one thing that will help you is to get used to figuring out how many different possibilities there are.  if you are worried that there is not enough space around H2 for two eyes, then look at where else you can make eyes.  one possibility is the play that you just made.  the other obvious possibility is at F2.  so, that means you have two options.  consequently, if white plays at one of them, you can play the other.  so, you should take sente here to play somehwere else on the board.]
;W[go];B[gb]C[***** this is a good idea, but the one-space jumpt to H18 would be even better.]
;W[hc];B[qn];W[qm];B[qo]C[Should this have been S6

***** i think this is ok.  s6 could give you bad shape depending on how w played.]
;W[ds];B[es];W[rm];B[rn];W[po];B[qj];W[qi];B[ri];W[rk];B[rj]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[oi]C[It was about this point I realized his aggresiveness wasn't a tactic, but that he was just bloodthirsty. While I had made some nice bunches of territory, he just had thickness which was effectively useless because of the left edge and my C10 group of stones

****** here is where i disagree with you.  i have played players like this before and i have used this strategy before.  what i *think* he is doing, is trying to seal you out of the center, and then just taking the HUGE center + a side or two.  in addition, he is forcing you to live small on the sides and corners (small compared to his influence).  if he effectively seals you out of the center, then there is little chance of an invasion succeeding.  after he seals this black group off, his next play should be at e16, and then press down on that black group.  so far, you have been playing his game by not pushing out into his sphere of influence, but letting yourself be sealed in.  if you notice, he has not actually gone all out and tried to kill your groups.  he is happy to let your groups live as long as they are confined to the side or the corner, and their life is small.]
;B[df]C[I was hoping hed ignore me here and try to cut of the C10 group, giving me the whole left edge]
;W[eg]C[****** this is mantaining the pressure i spoke about before.]
;B[ch];W[di]C[***** if you notice, he is happy to give away that side and corner territory as long as he keeps pushing you down.  eventually, he will shut you into that corner.]
;B[dh];W[eh];B[ed];W[fe];B[ee];W[ef];B[dg];W[ok]C[***** this is a bad move for white.  he should play at P10]
;B[nh];W[oh];B[og];W[ng];B[pg];W[nf]C[*anagrama*: am i?];B[oj]
;W[ni];B[nj];W[mj];B[nk];W[ml];B[mk];W[mh];B[lj];W[mi]C[***** ah, he let you into the center.   now white is in trouble.  he has bet the whole game on being able to keep you out.]
;B[lk];W[ki]C[Raziel: Indeed. More aggresive then I usually am anyway. You putting me on the dfefense really threw off my rythm]
;B[jk];W[jj];B[kj]C[Raziel: You are very good though];W[ji]
;B[il];W[kl]LB[ib:a][fi:b][hn:c][ci:d][pm:e][ko:f]C[***** now that you are in the center, you are going to have to start making bigger reductions in his territory.  i have marked some good plays on the board.]
;B[kk];W[ll];B[ol]LB[pm:a]C[****** this is too small.  it would be better to cut at A]
;W[pk];B[nl];W[om];B[pl];W[pm];B[nm];W[mn];B[nn];W[no];B[mm]
;W[lm];B[ln];W[mo];B[km];W[on];B[hj]LB[fi:a][ej:b]C[***** this is the right idea, but it would be better to peep at A or B]
;W[hi];B[gj];W[gi];B[ij];W[ii];B[ek];W[dk];B[ck];W[dj];B[ci]
;W[ko]C[Raziel: I think you got me though. Your advantage in the upper middle is probably too much for me too come back from]
;B[cm]C[*anagrama*: oh...i thought i would loose :)
Looking back, I think this was real dumb. Could he have sliced me in ha,lf at C10/C8?

**** yes, but you might have been able to live by connecting with the other b group.  if you want to extend down the left side, you should extend at C8 instead of C7.]
;W[lo];B[jl];W[cn]C[Raziel: It'll be close. Until I ripped into your middle I thought you would beat me by 50+ moku
*anagrama*: btw: how does that clock work?];B[bn];W[co]C[Raziel: One minute opening time, then ten minutes byoyomi time, 10 minutes to place 24 moves. Don't know how it works past the first byoyomi]
;B[bo];W[bp]LB[cj:a]C[*anagrama*: thx
Raziel: Eh, didn't want to rush. If I pushed in too hard, you probably could've cut me off


***** you still need to fix shape at A.];B[dl]C[Raziel: crap. I think you'll get me on time]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[em];B[el];W[gm];B[hm];W[hn];B[hl];W[gl];B[gk]
;W[jo];B[in];W[io];B[jn]LB[ib:a]C[***** these are all pretty small in comparison to A.]
;W[ls];B[ks];W[ns];B[os];W[kn];B[lm];W[ql];B[fj];W[ei];B[dm]
;W[dn];B[pe];W[nd];B[oe];W[ne];B[cq]C[Saw this after looking for every possible sente]
;W[cp];B[bq];W[ap];B[dq]C[Raziel: Didn't think I'd get that one by you]
;W[am];B[bm];W[ao];B[an];W[cj];B[bj];W[hb]C[***** this was the biggest move on the board.]
;B[ha];W[ia];B[ga];W[ib]C[Raziel: I'll hand it to you though. You have one of the best offenses I've ever seen
*anagrama*: thx :)];B[fi];W[fh];B[li];W[lh];B[na];W[ma]C[Raziel: This'll be close]
;B[oa];W[mb];B[qh];W[sm];B[sn];W[sk]LB[rp:a]C[Raziel: hmmm... Now its suddenly not accepting my moves


***** you still have a big weakness at A];B[sj];W[qp]C[***** this was mistake, it should have been one line lower at S4.]
;B[rp];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq];B[sq];W[so];B[rr]C[Raziel: Would've worked, cept I caught you in the ladder
Raziel: You didn't have enough room];W[aq];B[cr];W[ej];B[bl]
;W[ar];B[bs];W[br];B[cs];W[as]C[*anagrama*: its at the end, isnt it?]
;B[oc]C[Raziel: Yeah, just debating whether something would work
Could an invasion at G12 or F14 have worked? They looked like they were close enough together that I might have been able to beat him in a capturing race]
;C[
Raziel: L4 is dead
Raziel: Yeah, if I hadn't been able to cut into your middle, the scores would've been reversed. Nice game. MY only suggestion is to build some solid terrirotory at the beggining before attack]
