;W[cc];B[fd];W[gc];B[df];W[qo]C[The moment I played this I thought a pincer at R7 or such would have been very painful, was I right?

Zander: It may lead to some fighting, but White has a lot of reasonable options. The stone at R10 also helps, and I think should discourage the low pincer from Black.]

;B[he];W[iq];B[qp]
(;W[po]C[This move felt very natural to me while playing, but reviewing afterwards the move black took next this one looks really not correct...

Zander: Yes, I think this move is too slow. It doesn't threaten Black in the corner or cut off access to the middle, so the main effect of the move seems to be to strengthen the white group at the right. That's not urgent, and there are bigger alternatives.]
;B[ic];W[qg];B[kq]
(;W[ld]C[I felt I had to invade otherwise black would have had a super territory in the top side, is this a correct way to accomplish that?

Zander: As long as the Black group is kept low at the top, the territory is not too super. I don't think the invading stone will get killed, but Black may make decisive gains in the center while attacking (see variations). Playing this move further out serves two purposes: reducing Black's territory and also building a framework with the white stones on the right.]

(;W[dg]MA[io][mn][nj][re]C[Zander: White needs to play 3 times in this area to gain about 12 points. Black can afford to ignore the first two, so White is only getting about 4 points for each play while there are bigger plays available.]
(;B[cf]MA[ro][kd][bm][jr][hb][re]C[At this point I felt VERY confortable, I thought I had a lot of territory while black only had some in the and upper and lower right corner, but probably my assessment of the situation was not correct...

Zander: White does seem to be ahead, but not by much. There are still some potentially large gains around N6, and there are a lot of significant endgame plays that are probably going to decide the game.]

MA[jr][bm][hb][re]C[Zander: Since there are several double-sente moves to be played, sente is very valuable right now. In fact, I'd almost say whoever has sente is going to win the game by taking about about 16 points at the marked points. So White would do well to ignore this to gain the tempo.]
(;W[mn];B[bm];W[bl];B[oj];W[pi];B[jr]C[Here it is where I started to feel like I was being squeezed by all sides...

Zander: To stop being squeezed, White is going to have to ignore a threat at some point. You have to be careful, but I think White can ignore this threat to go for "mutual damage" making a big threat in the upper right.]
