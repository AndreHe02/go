C[Brakeshoe- Thanks for reviewing, I made major blunders, maybe some bad habits or greed. I put comments throughout to show what I was thinking atm and how I see it afterwards.


Ferushen (4k)  my pleasure, I have answered your questions and added comments of my own, I hope they help]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[dj]C[Brakeshoe- Not that i dislike w getting d10 buti felt maybe if he went d12 or sumthing i keep sente attacking bottom stone and then go hi or low chinese on the right.




This is a mistake.
Remember the order "Corner, Side, Center".

W has played hoshi at the top and bottom, so those corners are ballanced and needn't be contested.
The top and bottom right hand corners are still not settled and are the biggest points on the board.
D10 is a good move, but when there are still open corners, as here, then you should play the corner moves first.

P17 would be my choice for b.];W[oc]C[Brakeshoe- Unfortunately he approached..

Of course he did.  That is one of the two biggest points on the board.   P17 also has a good relationship with d16.]
;B[pf]C[Brakeshoe- That ok?

It's ok I think.  I don't know the joseki from here, but you can look them up.]
;W[qb]C[bad move by white, b has sente now

this move is what is known as "diving for the mud".  it's a seccond line move when there are still third and fourth line moves available.
This move is yose.];B[cf]C[This is not a bad move, but the timing is wrong.  There is still an open corner at R5.  "Corner, Side, Center".   Corners are ALWAYS bigger.]
;W[ce]C[this is a thank you move for b, allowing b to make a 2 stone wall with an ideal extention.  W's mistake.]
;B[df];W[qk];B[qi];W[rj]C[Brakeshoe- That looked way too thin to me and I thought i had to take profit of it... turned out it had me dead later.

It didin't die from this shape, you should be ok, we'll see where you went wrong later.
S10 is a mistake, again a 2nd line move when there are 3rd line moves available.]
;B[qn]C[Brakeshoe-  Large shimari as a double purpose move

exactly, r7 may be better though, this gives w a bit of wiggle room]
;W[rh];B[ri];W[si];B[qj];W[rl];B[qh];W[rg]C[Brakeshoe- Black 19 and 21 trying to connect and get influence in sente.. maybe i needed q9.

b is fine.  you need to start thinking about your moyo and how you are going to use this new wall.  q9 is a good move here, otherwise w will negate your influence by jumping out]
;B[jq]C[Brakeshoe- Looked like largest move available];W[qp]
;B[pp]C[Brakeshoe- Trying to preserve connection];W[qo];B[po]
;W[pn]
(;B[qq];W[rn];B[rp];W[ro];B[on];W[pm];B[om];W[pl];B[jn]C[Brakeshoe-  I thought i had a pretty good result in the corner after all and i took a shot at xpanding but it wasnt large enough , maybe i had to go for g3-f3 instead. Are those 2 spaces jumps useless?

They are not "useless", but in this situation a two space extention would be shy.  K3 is even too close to that 5 stone wall.  You know of course that you extend 2 spaces from a single stone on the third line, 3 from a two stone wall (like at d10), 4 from a 3, etc... so... from a 5 stone wall like the one at p6, you would extend 6 spaces to h3.

But the k3 stone was already there, so it cannot be helped.

However!  k6 is an example of what not to do, even if it seems intuitive.  this is thinking too small.  don't use walls to directly enclose territory, use them to ATTACK!

c6 would be a better move

also consider the top side is very important];W[pe];B[qe];W[qf]
;B[oe];W[pd];B[od];W[pc];B[qg];W[rf];B[ic]C[Brakeshoe- Thought i could handle the atari and i thought there was a chance he answered on top, keeping my sente, but I was wrong.

Yeah, this sucked for b :(];W[md];B[mf]C[Brakeshoe- Stone that accomplishes nothing.

:)];W[of];B[pg];W[nf];B[nh];W[mg];B[ng];W[ne];B[mh];W[lg];B[fc]
;W[db]C[w's mistake again

attaching at c15 was a mistake because it gave b an ideal extention

if w attaches at e17 and b stands up to f16, then b has a less than ideal extention

so w should attach at e17 here];B[cn]C[nice for b

too bad k6 is so inefficient

it was a greedy, misguided move];W[co];B[dn]C[w did it again!   learn from his mistakes]
;W[bo]C[i would consider ignoring this for now... it's a 2nd line move, and if you use this as your sente and he does jump in and ruin your territory on the side, you will get 2 free moves on the outside, which, if you play it right, should be worth more]
(;B[bn];W[gq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cr];W[dr];B[ap];W[ao];B[cp];W[do]
;B[bs];W[bp];B[bq];W[ar]C[Brakeshoe-  Another failure

it couldn't be anything else, it was not a sound invasion... however, it would have been good as a source of ko threats, but you exhausted them all at once]
;B[le]C[this is a bad idea i think

use the aji of the n14 stone, but don't try to rescue it];W[lf]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[ld];W[me];B[mc]C[Brakeshoe- Greedy

yeah, clearly not good];W[lb];B[mb];W[kb];B[jc];W[jb];B[ib]
;W[nc];B[be];W[bd];B[de];W[cd];B[bf]C[ah!  this is a common sequence, and you make a mistake here... learn this one

b14 should be at e16

the b15 stone is a sacrifice for sente, always.

that b15 stone is worth only 4-5 points, sente is worth much much more at this point in the game]
;W[fd]C[yeah, and now he gets out.... that is really hard for b now]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[fg];W[ke];B[hf];W[kd];B[ec];W[ed];B[cc]C[Brakeshoe- Furthermore greedyness

yes, you should be building a moyo... w is going to ruin it as soon as he gets sente]

;B[ij];W[ch]C[that hurts to watch

game over, b resigns here

b14 was the losing move in this game, k6 was also a big mistake, c3 should have been saved for a ko threat

i hope this helped
