C[Hi, my name is PJ Wehry.  I am 10 kyu on KGS.  I am billdoor, and I am playing black this game.

---------------------------

JJHaggar: Hi! My name is Juan Jesus, and I'm JJHaggar on KGS. I hope my comments can be of any help :)]
;B[pp];W[cd];B[cp];W[qd]C[what are the advantages of star point vs. 3-4?

---------------------------

JJHaggar: The 3-4 point claims upon the corner territory.
JJHaggar: The 4-4 point emphasizes influence rather than corner territory, BUT it also can be used to make territory (that's why I like starpoints so much ^_^).]
;B[ep];W[jq]
(;B[ed];W[cf];B[jd]TR[gd][hd]C[JJHaggar: Maybe a bit too wide for a jump, be careful or you could be cut around these points]
;W[nd];B[ck];W[qj];B[ql]
(;W[nq]
(;B[oq]C[JJHaggar: Not very good move I think. It helpes him to reinforce his stones.]
;W[np];B[pn]TR[qq]C[JJHaggar: Be careful, there is still that weakpoint.]

(;W[gq]C[JJHaggar: White has made a good base in the bottom]
;B[fq]C[JJHaggar: Again you should not make this move]
(;W[gp]C[JJHaggar: Reinforcement is not neccessary for W. His lower group was already strong enough]
;B[ch]C[JJHaggar: Good direction!]
(;W[qg]C[JJHaggar: Bad one I think];B[lc];W[ld];B[kc]

(;B[fe]C[JJHaggar: Dangerous move for B :S]
(;W[dd];B[dg];W[ee];B[ff];W[hf]C[JJHaggar: Too slow];B[gh]C[JJHaggar: Good]
;W[jj]C[JJHaggar: Interesting move. This works very well with White strenght in the center. You must do something now]
;B[gk]TR[dh][eh][fh][ci][gi][cj][gj][dk][ek][fk]C[JJHaggar: Good. Box-like moyos are usually good]
;W[dn]C[JJHaggar: It seems like an overplay :)]

(;W[gr]C[JJHaggar: ? Strange move. Gote and no points.]

;W[op];B[or];W[cq]C[JJHaggar: Overplay again.];B[cr];W[bq];B[br]
;W[lg]C[Should I have pushed at M13 before this?

JJHaggar: At N13 I think, M13 helps white to build his moyo]

(;B[em]C[JJHaggar: This move is unnecessary. Don't kill a dead group. It's like you pass your turn.]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[cm];B[bm];W[ds]C[JJHaggar: This is not a problem, you can tenuki (play elsewhere)]
