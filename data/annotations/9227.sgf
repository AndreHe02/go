Hi Dan, my name is Paul and if you have any questions email me at paul.ohmart@gmail.com
Thank you.];B[pd]C[Hi, thanks for reviewing. I am black here. I pointed out the major mistakes I noticed, but I'm sure there are more. I'm looking for tips on general strategy and direction of play, and also any tactical mistakes you notice.]
