There are some moves missing in the latter part of the middle game.]

DT[1996-07-28]TM[1200]KM[0.5];B[qd];W[pp];B[dp];W[cc];B[oc]C[This is a good, solid move. It makes territory in the corner, and  implies that next B will play somewhere in the area around Q10 if given the  chance.
White must now choose between furthering his own development, or attempting  to interfere with Black's development. Or better still, do both at once.]
(;W[qg]C[In hindsight, it is easy to say that the ensuing sequence up  to B #18 (S16) ended badly for white.  Whether this particular move was to blame or not is open to question, but see  Var 2 for an alternative.]

;B[qj]L[ql][oj][og]C[White did not respond  well to this move, so it turned out well for Black, but I wonder if Black  gave sufficient consideration to how the game would have developed if W:R8  (a), B:P10 (b), W:P13 (c), for example.
There are numerous alternate moves available here, for instance developing  Black's stone in the lower left by playing around the star points on either  the left or the lower side, or by 'kakari' against either of White corner  stones.]
;W[md]C[Unfortunately, White misses his chance to regain the  initiative here, and plays a luke-warm move that neither threatens the  'shimari' in the corner, nor reinforces the lone stone on the left.]
;B[qn]C[This is another patient, solid move by Black that establishes his  position on the right. What White needs to do now is reinforce his stones on  the upper right. His stone in the lower right corner is strong enough to  leave on its own for now. (see Var 2 for illustration)]

(;W[mq]C[This  is probably not the time to be making territory here.];B
[ph]M[pf]C[How about playing this from the other side, (triangle) and keeping the two  white stones separated?]
;W[pe]L[og][of][qe]C[This is a weak move, I feel, because it leaves  Black with a move that will either cut White into two groups, or allow Black  to connect his two groups. At this point, White should have jumped out to 'a'  or 'b,' or attached at 'c.']
(;B[pd]M[rf]C[Black doesn't seem to take  full advantage of this situation, does he? He gains territory in the corner,  but lets White connect all his stones, albeit without much shape. What would  have happened if Black had played this move at S14 (triangle) instead?]

;W[oe];B[pg];W[qe];B[re]C[In terms of keeping  sente, this 'hane' is not such a good move. If you feel compelled to protect  the corner here, S-16 would have been better.]
;W[rf];B[rd]C[Now, S-16 is 'gote' for Black.];W[fp]L[cn][dj][ce]
C[I admit that  hindsight is 20-20, but I don't think that this was a good move at this time.  I think that the situation called for a play somewhere along the left side,  possibly at a, b or c.]
;B[dn];W[fm];B[dl];W[eq];B[dq];W[ci];B[cj];W[di];B[dj];W[ei]C[The sequence up to this point seems to have worked to Black's  advantage, even though it is White who seems to be playing in sente.]
;B[gq]L[er][fr]C[This move seems to me to be a bit cavalier. If White had  played just a bit more skillfully, he could have let Black live on the  bottom, and made a big invasion of Black's territory on the left. What would  Black have done if White answered this move at either a or b?]
;W[fq]L[er]C[Instead of feeling like his territory has been stolen, and resisting  as hard as he can, White should have played at 'a' here, and invaded the  Black corner in retaliation.]
;B[gp];W[go];B[jq];W[ho];B[lr];W[lq];B[gr];W[fr];B[kr];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr]
;B[hq];W[ip];B[hs];W[jp];B[mr];W[nr];B[kq];W[kp]L[bs]C[Even  though this is gote, White has confined Black very nicely, and made some  thickness on the lower side. Furthermore, F1 would probably be sente for  White, after which he can invade all the way to 'a' on the left, and in sente  to boot. Too bad White didn't realize it.]
;B[ed]C[There are several  big points just waiting to be played here, but in my own opinion, E16 is not  one of them. If White had counter-attacked from around G17, Black would have  had a tough fight ahead of him.  Where are the big points?
Compare the difference between Black playing S4 versus White playing S5. A  nice profit is waiting for whoever plays there first.
Another good idea for Black is to move out into the center from the right  side, thus threatening to attack White's weak group in the upper right, while  negating the value of White's thickness on the bottom. N12 or N13, or maybe  even around O7 are all possibilities.]
;W[de]M[ci][di][ei]C[When  attacking, one should chase the enemy toward one's strong stones, not away  from them. White should have attacked from the other side and made Black run  towards the marked stones.]

C[White's idea here is good, but  instead of cutting the group in two, why not take some profit in the lower  right corner first, then attack the group as a whole. When attacking, the  goal is not to kill your opponent's stones outright, but to seal them in so  that they no longer have any influence on other sections of the board. (See  variation)]

;B[pf];W[qf];B[rh];W[pn];B[po];W[om];B[qq];W[qp];B[nq]C[Up to this point, White  has made a successful invasion, but for some reason, this is where it all  starts to unravel.
What is White's correct response to this cut?](;W[np]C[Giving atari in this manner was horrendous.
See the variation for a better play threatening their opponent.];W[mi]C[R-12 would have been better.]
;B[jh];W[lg];B[lj]M[lk][mk][ml]C[The three stones in  atari are meaningless now!
If White had given atari at M-11, sacrificing the three meaningless stones,  and then played N-14, the black group on the right would have had to fight a  ko to live.]
;W[kk];B[kj];W[ni];B[ne];W[nd];B[of];W[od]C[White should give 'atari' at N15 first, and then  connect at P16.]
;B[oh];W[ob];B[pb];W[nc];B[pc];W[me]C[Black does not need to answer this anymore.]
;B[ja];W[kb];B[nb];W[ma]C[Why not N-18 here?];B[mb];W[lb];B[jj];W[br]C[As long as Black can give  atari at D1, this move is useless.]

;B[dk]C[Why didn't Black play  E9 here?];W[jk]
(;B[cd]C[This is a bad move. Black could have  played E17 in sente, or even D17. (see variation)]
;W[dd];B[dc];W[ec];B[db];W[cb];B[ce];W[ef];B[ff];W[cf]M[db][dc]C[Since the two marked stones are clearly captured,  this move would have been better played at J9, etc.]
;B[ik]C[This is a good move for Black, but if White had taken the  trouble to count the score, he would have realized that he is in the lead,  and doesn't have to fight so hard to win.]
;W[hk]C[This is the move  that lost the game for White. If White had played J8 instead, he would have  won by about 15 points.]
;B[il];W[gj];B[jl];W[kl];B[hj];W[hi];B[ij];W[ii]C[White's objective here  is good, but he needs to defend his own weaknesses before attacking.  Connecting at G11 would have forced Black to make another eye at G13, and  given White sente.]

;B[gm];W[gn]M[hk][gl][hl]C[The three marked  stones are in atari, so this move has no meaning. White should have just made  an eye at K6 and lived.]
;B[en]M[hk][gl][hl]C[Again, why connect here  when you could have take the three marked stones?]

 muad NR : i think its dead now
 django 16k*: is entering byo-yomi

Yes, the White group has only one eye now. Of course, the Black group at the  top has only one itself. I doubt that the situation would result in 'seki,'  but Black has been  attacking all out and ignoring his own weaknesses, too.]

 muad NR : is entering byo-yomi];B[jo];W[jm];B[ko]C[White misread the situation, and  had to resign. Both sides had only one eye, and it's hard to say who would  have won the fight to capture first. If White had realized that he was ahead  on territory, he would probably not have played so poorly in the end.

In summary I would say that both sides played well in spots, but made big  mistakes in crucial places. Overall, White played better, and would have won  on territory had he not made a crucial mistake at the end of the game. Black  played well, but needs to reinforce his own weaknesses before attacking.]

(;W[ro]C[Attacking from here  would take profit in the corner, and attack at the same time.]
;B[rn];W[on];B[pl];W[ri];B[rj];W[nl]C[This is just one possible variation, but the idea  is for White to seal Black in and build his influence in the center into  territory.
Of course, Black will not always be so cooperative, and may stage a  counter-attack of his own, but this is the basic idea.]))

(;B[rf]L[qf][rg]C[If  White blocks at 'b,' Black 'a' cuts him neatly in two. If he blocks a 'a,'  Black 'b' connects his stones along the right, and Whites stones are left  floating in space.  White would most likely play at 'a,' and what follows is . . .]

;W[sf];B[pf];W[sg];B[pg]C[If White is satisfied with this kind of result, then by all  means let him play it out. Black's thickness is more than sufficient  compensation for letting White's group live.
Later, even if White extends to P15 here, Black can play S17 in sente,  securing the corner while White's group is shapeless and floating in the  center of the board.]))

(;W[pi]C[If, for example, White were to play like  this and ignore the 'kakari' on the bottom right, his stone there is still  very strong, as illustrated by this sample sequence.]
