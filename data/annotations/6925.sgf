C[This is Tony 10k on "Go city". Thanks for your review. I would like to know:
1.Game start of the top area. I think it's bad, but how?
2.The fighting of right area. Have I any chance to capture all white stones.

Hi, I'm Dave and I will be reviewing this game.

1.  I think Black's troubles start with his choice of opening.  Move 5 seemed of less value than other choices.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]LB[fc:A][oc:B]C[On this board, according to Yilun Yang (7p), enclosing  3-4 corner stone (B) is a much higher ranking move than approaching a 4x4 stone (A).  He ranks opening moves as follows (I have quoted only the relevant parts of the rankings):
First Class: play in an empty corner
Second Class (1): Enclose or approach a 3-4, 5-3, or 5-4 point stone
...
Third Class (4): Approach a corner with a 4-4 stone. 
I'm quoting from his book Fundamental Principles of Go 2004.
This is not to say that A is a bad move, but B is the simpler, and more valuable move in theory. For me, I feel like A is a 70% move.  consider how B not only encloses a corner, but also has great follow ups.  See variation.]

(;B[fc];W[oc]LB[lc:A][cf:B]C[P17 is a little unusual.  F17 approaches white's 4x4 stone, but white has tenukied.  This is usually reserved for a special strategy.  

For me, as black, I would prefer punishing white's choice to ignore the approach.  The purpose of the 4x4 stone is to build influence; black can severely reduce that potential development now by a second approach...see variation.]

(;B[lc]C[black is inviting a splitting move here.  Not necessarily bad, but black has to be prepared to fight.]

(;B[hd]LB[fc:A][ic:C][lc:B]C[This peep is sente, but doesn't help the A group run out.  It strengthens the white C group, and in so doing, hurts black's own B group.]
;W[id];B[ff]C[black is wise to spend a move to help this group, but the other weak group is now in danger.]
;W[ef]LB[eg:A][lg:B]
(;B[eg];W[dg];B[dh];W[cg];B[fh]LB[ce:A]C[locally, this was very nice for white - big corner that is almost settled.  and white can push out along the side at C12.]
;W[gd]C[this move has very little purpose];B[fd];W[he]LB[hc:A]
[lg:B]C[likewise, H16 is not an important stone.  It does not connect two weak black groups; it does not cut any white groups; allowing it to be captured would give white 2 points.]

(;B[hc];W[gg];B[fg];W[hb]LB[gc:A][lg:B]C[again, these two stones are worth very little on this board.]
