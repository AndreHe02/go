C[Hello and thank you for reviewing my game. Before you start, I'd like to point out that I've been trying to improve my reading by doing tsumego and the like, and lack knowledge of joseki. This is partly deliberate as I feel like I get a better training by reading sequences from the very beginning.

Hence, I'd like that you focus especially on the local fights, pointing out missed tesuji, bad shape, and alternative sequences that would bring a better local result. Of course, I don't mind general advice if you feel it is  Do not hesitate to show only the first one or two moves and let me work out the sequence by myself. In short, I'd like rather more one-move comments than long sequences.

Thank you again by advance.

B: Hi my name is Biondy. 3 dan and I'm your reviewer for this game. I'll start my coment with B.]
;B[pd]C[anarres [4k\]: enjoy the game];W[dq];B[dd];W[pp];B[co]
;W[gp]C[B: I'm not a big fans of this move as it leaves many weakness. Later in this game, black exploits white's weakness in this formation.]
;B[qn];W[ql];B[nq]
(;W[pn]C[I wanted to emphasize the lower side in the context. My opponent pointed out this was not the good play, advising o4 instead.

B: I'm not sure about emphasizing the lower side since it is still open. This is a good move. Attaching the other side doesn't give you the lower side. See the variation]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[qq];W[pq]C[anarres [4k\]: ooh
anarres [4k\]: R5 was the joseki move
Jhyn [4k\]: ok];B[po]C[Jhyn [4k\]: i was dissatisfied with the result]
;W[on]
(;B[qp]C[B: P5 is another option. This move gives white too many thickness for a small corner.]
;W[oo];B[qo];W[qr]
(;B[op];W[oq]C[I felt I had no choice but to atari here.

B: Yes. The atari is correct here.];B[np];W[nr]C[This situation was intricate and black could get a good result with s2, but he misread.]
;B[mr];W[rr];B[or];W[pr];B[ns];W[rq]
(;B[nn]C[It seems I was lucky with this sequence. Is o6 the best alternative to build influence here?

B: I don't really see any influence for black here...];W[om]
;B[iq];W[cp]C[I realized this was a bad move right after playing it. I wanted to make the stones heavier while covering my corner to attack them from behind, but g4 was too far away for that.

B: I think the pincer is better here. J3 was vital for white's formation.]
;B[do];W[ci]CR[do][co]C[I carried on with my plan nevertheless because e4 would give a very good extension to black and I felt like taking the risk of handling e4 by giving away half of my corner. On retrospective, c11 feels too far away.

B: I think this one is fine. C10 is too close to the 2 black stones.]
;B[eq]CR[gp]LB[fp:A]C[B: Now G4 is better at A.];W[ep];B[dp]
;W[fq]
(;B[er]C[B: I think the atari is better.];W[dr];B[eo];W[fp]
;B[cq];W[cr];B[bp];W[cf];B[fd];W[bd];B[cc];W[qf];B[qh]
(;W[qc]C[B: I don't like the final result of this invasion. Maybe double kakari is better here.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc];B[lc]LB[ob:A]
C[Black seems overconcentrated now, but I didn't want to let him connect.

B: This is a very good move from black. White can't abandon this move or black will play at A and this move works well with black at the upper left.]
;W[nd];B[oc];W[ob];B[ne]C[Things go downhill for me from now on, and my reading is awful here. Was o16 a mistake to begin with ?

B: It's hard to find a good move for white here. M17 is well placed.
O16 is fine,];W[ld];B[md]
(;W[me]C[B: Bad move. N17 or O18 is the only answer here.];B[nb]
C[There is not a single white move in this sequence that is correct, it seems.]
;W[mc]C[B: What about Q18 instead? Can you work out the sequence?]
;B[mb];W[md];B[pb]C[Jhyn [4k\]: that was such a bad move indeed
anarres [4k\]: i think m17 was an overplay but i don't know how to refute it]
;W[hc]C[Jhyn [4k\]: i think ignoring was all right
Jhyn [4k\]: invading the top
Jhyn [4k\]: but it looks like a shape move];B[kd];W[lb]C[I misread on top right, i thought i could use the sente on r19]
;B[kc];W[ec];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[gc];W[ed];B[ee]LB[md:A]
[he:B][ec:C]C[I was quite happy at this point, but it seems i was wrong. Those corner sequences are definitely my weak point, and i'd like your opinion very much here.

B: It's hard to disrupt black's position in the corner. Black is too strong in this area and you have another group you have to take care. I probably would just jump out with H15(B) instead of E17(C)]
;W[de];B[dc]C[anarres [4k\]: i made the magic shape
Jhyn [4k\]: i was reading it, seems all right here];W[cd];B[df]
;W[ce];B[db];W[bc];B[fa];W[rf]C[Here I felt desperate and tried to swallow a large right side to get back in the game.]
;B[se];W[nf];B[oe];W[of];B[pg]LB[nh:A]C[I feel like this is a raw peep. What do you think?

B: I think this is ok. white has to connect here and black can play A to help his stones here.]
;W[pf];B[mf];W[mg];B[lf]
(;W[ni]C[Breaking the ladder. I can happily give n13 if black tries to cut.

B: I wonder if P12 is better...];B[pj];W[ok]C[Still the ladder, and shutting black in.]
;B[rk]C[B: Black played very well here. It's hard to find a way to kill the stones.]
;W[si]C[Trying to get rid as cleanly as possible of any possibility of eyes.]
;B[sg];W[rg];B[rh];W[sh]C[Believe it or not, I didn't realize black could connect when I played this move.]
;B[og];W[ng];B[sf];W[sk]C[Now it's just finding a place to resign.]
;B[rl];W[rj];B[qk];W[rm];B[sl]C[B: Overall, white got an early advantage with the sequence at the lower right corner. However, the play at the top area was a mess for white. I think W54 was the problem. Keep on doing tsumego and learn the fuseki. I hope you can grow stronger soon.

Best regards,
