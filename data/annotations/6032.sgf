;B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[pj];W[qe]C[Did my previous move (Q10) invite this invasion by white?

Would it have been better to secure the corner before extending or extending towards the upper left hand side of the board to create strength along the top?

--

I'm no fuseki expert, but I'm pretty sure Q10 makes less sense than something within a few spaces of j16 or so.  In any case, I don't think R15 is a well thought out invasion anyway.  White would be much better off playing around E16 in my opinion.

You're supposed to play _away_ from thickness, not _inside_ it. :)  Of course, there are exceptions to every rule.]

(;B[mc]C[Is this an appropriate response to the invasion?

--

It's as good as any.  Arguably, because of the Q10 stone, you can even tenuki.  The double approach move doesn't work as well with K16 or Q10 stones -- hence the reason the double wing formation is so strong.  Of course, usually the double wing has Q17 at Q16...  I'm not sure I know anything about the 3-4 double approach (if there is one).  But it feels safe to ignore R15 and go look for something that's worth 15 points or more.

In the first 20 or 30 moves of the game you should look for those 15 point moves and ignore the smaller stuff (unless it's critical to respond immediately).  Generally, it's not critical unless it's worth more than your 15 point move elsewhere.  It's difficult to figure out how much early moves are worth, but consider that he needs to spend at least three moves to get his R15 stone to do something useful (that is, surround something and/or make eyes).

In the mean time you could make 15*3 or 45 points somewhere else.   A 45 point lead could easily win the game!]
;W[ph];B[dg];W[ec];B[cq]C[Was this 3,3 counterattack a sensible move or should I have focused on defending?

--

The 3-3 invasion is rarely a good move.  It encourages white to make so much outside thickness that he can dominate the board.  There are two main joseki for the invasion... both turn out somewhat better than what you did in other circumstances, but you can out on the top side of the fight -- which probably helps here.]

(;B[jq]C[from this position was extending along the 3rd line the best move?  Should I have looked to extend further or somewhere else?

--

I answered this before I got to the question!  It is not a good move.    Play away from thickness (yours or your opponent's).  This move doesn't really do anything and that's the main problem.  You should always look for the movies that do two things (attack and gain thickness, or divide and attack, live and destroy, etc).

This doesn't even do one thing!

There is a rule that you should extend 3 stones from a two stone wall and 4 stones from a three stone wall, but this is a particularly strong wall (since it has a wall and things).  It also points at a white stone.  The white stone cancles out your wall entirely unless you get the first move and find a way to cover it up (as in my variation).]

--

There's really no need to escape.  It seems clear that you'll live no matter what and there isn't any territory to get in there anymore... It's better to spread out up on top.  The big move attacks E17 while building thickness.]

--

With a group this weak, it's not best to attack at all.  Fleeing is the correct option.  The move to attack the E17 stone is still there.  You have quite a few stones invested in 0pts of territory and it's better to not let them turn into negative 20 points while you play the big move at E17.  It's a bit of a toss up though.  Rescuing somewhat dead groups should be considered "painful."

That said, P12 is as good an escaping move as can be had here.]

The lefthand side?  The triangles?  I wonder if my editor reversed the game...

I'm not sure you could.  Realize that in an even game your opponent will be able to get just about as much territory as you -- or it probably shouldn't have been even in the first place.

On the other hand, if you mean the right hand side (the squares), I think the answer is mostly the same with the caveat that you -could- have attacked the right hand side way back when at move 37.  You could easily have spread from there if fortune went your way.

In any case, you can *still* get a huge chunk of territory along the top if you took care of E17 in some clever way.]

Yes.

Hopefully I already covered that...  You *should* have the whole upper side and the upper right corner.  You had plenty of opportunities to take it.  They are very hard to see at first though.]

Definitely think bigger.

Notice how it took over 20 stones to gain 4 points of territory (squares)?

The moral of the story is:  If the stones aren't *doing* anything, they're not worth keeping!

Don't worry.  It just takes practice to start to see more of the board.  You can get a huge advantage earlier on by trying to surround a minimum of 15 points of territory with each move -- but don't let anything die in the process...

Really, in the 20+ kyu range, you just need to practice a lot of life and death problems.  If you can live you'll have an enormous advantage.  Fuseki is one of the hardest things in the game because it takes a good deal of experience to judge how well you're doing.
