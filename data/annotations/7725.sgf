C[Hi there, thank you for reviewing...

As usuall, I want to mainly discuss opening, because I think I've already lost there. Well, maybe I lost, because I wasn't strong enough to find in center and utilize my thickness...

hello tomas, my name is fantomas and i'm your reviewer !
Here are a few advices to help you to improve : 
1) always ask you the question "what do i want do to with my move" before playing (this may sounds stupid but it helps a lot)
2) You try too hard to make points int the center, influence is not for making points but attacking your opponent groups !
Enjoy !];B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce]C[I was my first 3k game, so I want to start with solid moves, to be sure, that I will win]
;W[jc];B[qn]C[Is it possible to ignore K17 stone ?

fantomas : Sure, there is no problem with that.];W[nq];B[pk]
;W[qh]LB[qi:A]C[R12 looks played too early, but how to punish ?

fantomas : Indeed this move is way too early.
Besides, at a local scale, it should be played at A.]
(;B[cn]C[fantomas : this is definitly the wrong place, it is urgent to play on the right side or you will let white live easily here while endangering one of your groups whereas it should be exactly the opposite.
The difference is huge.]
(;W[co];B[dn];W[cg];B[cj]C[Well, maybe I could attack at C11 ?

fantomas : this move is safe, it is the proper extension from you two stones below while not letting white the possibility of making a proper extension to stabilize his group.]
;W[gc]
(;B[ee]C[fantomas : i think this move is wrong because :
1) playing on the right side is more important
2) it is the wrong direction, i would rather attach on the white top group and then attack from the other side (a shown in the previous diagram)
3) you won't be able to gain anything from this attack : at best, white group will run away without doing any damage.]

(;B[fp];W[fq];B[gp];W[gq]
(;B[hp]C[Should I rather jump to e10?

fantomas : no i would rather g12. besides e10 would be the wrong direction : you want to push toward your influence not from it.]
;W[ej];B[ek]C[fantomas : a mistake, you want to attack this group so don't attach him, it will only mke him stronger.]
;W[dj];B[dk];W[ci];B[fj];W[fi];B[gj];W[jq];B[mc]C[fantomas : what is the purpose of this move ?
it doesn't put any pressure on white top group, nor defend the corner nor attack the right white stone. 
You have to avoid these many-purposes moves because they a lot of things but often do them badly so they are less valuable than single-purpose moves that do only thing well.]
;W[pe]
(;B[od]C[This was bad... Q16 would be better, I think

fantomas : indeed, you put yourself here in the position where white plays a forcing move and you don't answer, so you are one move behind here.]
