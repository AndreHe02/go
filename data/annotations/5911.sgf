Carey [6k\]: have fun
Ekted [7k\]: have fun];B[qc]C[Carey [6k\]: you no, if no one else plays their games, then I think whoever wins our game will win the tournament]
;W[pp]C[Ekted [7k\]: yes, I was just gonna say :)];B[cq];W[dd]
;B[oe]C[Carey [6k\]: interesting opening
Ekted [7k\]: been playing around with it

This move seems redundant.  The 3-3 stone is quite strong, so why waste a reinforcement on it ?  As black, I would play as far away as possible from these strong sentries.  How about approaching either star stone instead ?]
;W[pd]C[white shouldn't play here either.  What was white worried that black would do if white didn't play here ?]
;B[qd];W[pe]C[This exchange was bad for black because black forced white to separate the two black groups, which is exactly what white wants to do.

We call this pushing from behind.

Instead of black R16, how about S15.  Then if white Q15 and black P14, then it's white that's pushing from behind.]
;B[pc];W[qe]C[
white should have played P16 to maintain the separattion of black's forces.  Remember, if white plays P16 and black plays P17 and white plays O16 and black plays O17 etc. black is only getting 2 points more on each exchange, while white is getting all kinds of possibilities in the center that's worth more than those small gains black is making.]
;B[od]C[now black is connected, and white is short of liberties.  This is good for black.]
;W[ph];B[jc];W[dp];B[dq]C[Finally, you've both settled down to normal go.]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[fp]C[
Black pushing from behind again, not good.

Instead of E3, I prefer F2 or B5 for black.];B[df];W[hc];B[je]
;W[id]C[This peep not good.  It prevents possible better peep at L16 later.]
;B[cj];W[jd]C[
black should answer the peep, which makes his territory solid and threatens his own invasion around F17 later.  Now this is much more difficult.]

C[this white move is a bit dangerous.  what if black gives up the 3 lower stones and captures the 4 upper white ones.]
;B[lo];W[lq];B[lp];W[mq];B[nr];W[or];B[jo]C[the exchange of white p2 with black k5 seems to give white more than it gives black.

So maybe black o2 is wrong, since although it separates white, both white groups are fairly safe.  Maybe black should play k5 right away.]
;W[qi];B[ql];W[qj];B[pk];W[qm];B[rl];W[nj]C[
white seems to have eye shape above and below the black stones while the black stones have none.

Maybe black should have played R10 instead of R8 but I'm not sure !

R10 threatens to slide in towards the corner next.];B[oi];W[ng]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[mh];W[mg];B[lh];W[lg];B[kh];W[kj]C[white L10 is what we call a coffee break move.

Don't take a coffee break now.  A fire is blazing !  PLay L13 for white instead of L10.]
;B[kg]C[black put out the fire.];W[kn];B[jp];W[hp]C[white H4 looks questionable.  What if black respodns at J3.  After that if white cuts, black plays L3 atari then L2 which is sente again, giving black stability.

For white,how about just J3 instead of H3.  Then white completely safe and black still under attack.]
;B[jn];W[hn];B[km];W[ln];B[lm];W[mn];B[im];W[mo]C[
white can still play J3 and keep black under pressure while stabilizing white.]
;B[mp];W[no];B[iq];W[ir];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr];W[ip];B[hm];W[jl]
C[instead of K8, how about L5 sente ?];B[jm];W[gm];B[hk];W[ik]
;B[il];W[jk];B[gl];W[fm];B[fl]C[is black F8 needed ?  Are the black stones in danger ?  Does F8 attack the white stones ?  For black, I'd be looking to attack the upper right.  How about S14 then if white answers at S15 then maybe S12 which threatens both T9 and Q14.]
;W[em];B[el]C[black is pushing from behind.  Not  good.];W[ie]
;B[jf]C[for white, instead of J15, I'd be more comfortable forcing with Q11, then make more room with S16 or S9.]
