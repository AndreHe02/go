C[Hello dear reviewer,
thank you very much for reviewing my game and helping me improve. I was playing white against another 12k on Tygem in a standard time control game (20min+3*30sec byoyomi) and finally resigned at move 159.
This game I lost horribly to a player who seemed a lot stronger than me but was constantly overplaying and trying to kill all of my groups. I have a lot of trouble playing against such players, since in these games it seems none of the principles - be it opening or middlegame - matter at all. All that matters is making eyes and preventing your opponent from doing so, which players employing such a style are usually good at. Also, as strange as that might seem, reviewing this game alone is psychologically impossible for me, as my opponents overplays (i.e. >80% of his moves) all seem to straight up work in retrospect. What's even more enraging is that the opponent's style seems extremely simplistic: always play the move that you would play if the only way you can win the game is by killing the whole board. It goes without saying that this is done instantly without any reading or positional considerations. Cut everything, invade everything, kill everything, don't read if that's possible and still win with extreme ease. It works to an extent that makes you think they could beat you even giving you 9 handicap stones (which in this game might actually be the case).
I want to learn how to calmly respond to such moves without also falling into the "kill or die" mindset. I tried to add my thoughts on most of the moves. Please focus on correcting the thoughts and mindset at least as much as on the correct moves in each situation. Since there are absolutely no joseki played out in this game (which once again proves that at 12k knowing joseki gives you no advantage whatsoever), please comment on the initial sequence leading to an instant fight. Is there a way to avoid it or to profit from such play by the opponent, which I completely failed to do? How bad "objectively" is such a style actually? I actually think I've been underestimating it.]
;B[pp]C[B: hi, I'm Bart, and I'll try to do a review of your game. I know your frustration, as it happened to me a lot too. I'm still trying to learn to respond more calmly and not too overplay too much myself, and attack when possible.]
;W[dd];B[ce]C[Here we go. That's supposedly a bad move. Guess what, in this game such considerations don't matter one bit.

B: yes, it does invite you to make your stone stronger, so not a good move by black I'd say.]
;W[cd]C[trying to take the corner

B: good response];B[cg]
(;W[de]LB[gc:A]C[greedy move? I was trying to get the corner as well as some outside.

B: because your two stones are already strong, and black made a very small extension, you can play calm here and just play around A.]
;B[cj]C[Black actually secures his group. I decide that the top corner is fine for now and it's time to resume normal opening play by taking some corners... this is probably a mistake, since an extension from the top left turns out to be very urgent.

B: no, I think its a good idea. Your group is strong and can surviive, black will be weak if he attacks there.]
;W[pd];B[ec]LB[gd:B][cf:A]C[And here I don't get anything in the corner but attacked instead. My mistake of forcing my opponent to attack me isn't helping. What would be the right response though? Black's move seems like an overplay.

B: see variations. With A you can secure your group. So you should be able to play something like B.]

(;W[gc]C[Saying to black "please kill both my corner as well as my pincer".

B: see variations, I think its safer to play onw line higher. Although you can still go for a wall to the right side because you have move C14 for your left group.]
;B[fd];W[gd];B[fe]C[Things like "black's shape seems bad" don't matter one bit here. I'm in huge trouble at move 13 already although it was black who overplayed... I don't see too many alternatives to g17 though, maybe f16? However that way black is going to live there, I'll get no points and my outside will be utterly useless. This here is even worse though. Instead of attacking black he's attacking me.

B: I think you overlooked C14 here, because that would make your life a lot easier.]

(;W[df]C[hoping it's sente. Probably that's way too slow.

B: close, should have been C14.];B[be]C[Black responds aiming at preventing eye shape for me in the corner.

B: and he's making shape for his own group as well.]
(;W[dg]C[again hoping it would be sente to maybe get to attacking black.

B: quite hard to say. Might be better to give up the four stones and play around L17 to make a base for your two stones and let them work with the top right stone. When running with the group, better to play E13, that's faster and doesnt make black stronger.]
;B[ch]C[I was expecting black to hane. This move seems way too reasonable...

B: that would give you cutting points. So indeed black has to secure his group.]

(;W[hf]C[probably f13 was the correct move for me. This just once again says "please kill me"...

B: yes, F13 is better.];B[fg];W[eh]C[B: doesn't work too good now]
;B[fh];W[ei];B[fi]C[I'm pushing from behind...

B: no, he is :-). See variations.]
(;W[dj];B[ck]C[black again responds defensively without thinking for even 3 seconds (which is about his avarage time spent on each move).

B: in this case it's the same as move 12. He doesnt want cutting points, becasue he's attacking you. And your move invites him to strengthen his stones and take care of any possible cutting points. So yes, its a move which pops to mind easily. You played something similar in the first moves (move 4).]
;W[fj]C[Maybe now it's not entirelly clear who's attacking who...

B: yes, problem is you have 2 weak groups and black only one.]
;B[gj];W[fk];B[gk];W[fl]LB[gd:B][ei:A]C[And here black goes back to attacking my pincering group, which actually seems like the absolutely right thing to do. How this turn out so terribly?

B:hopefully I've shown some pointers and possible escapes earlier on. And right now its hard to give up on a group. Lets see some more moves. your group A is relatively safe, so maybe you can give up on B and get some compensation in the corner.]
;B[ic]C[B: blacks attacking very close.];W[id]C[planing to make him live on the edge and strengthen myself aiming at the gut at g11... as if

B: same move as D13. It makes black stronger.];B[jc];W[jd];B[kd]
C[This might already be resignable?

B: there is still a lot to be decided. But its a matter of style. Some say its good to play lots of games quite fast to learn quickly, others say you should play on and see what you can get.]
;W[ke];B[ld]C[Now I  pretty much half conciously start overplaying myself, since I can see that I'm very far behind.

B: not an overplay in my opinion, but a move to give more space to your group.]
;W[nc]LB[kg:B][hh:A]TR[gc][gd][id][jd][ke][hf]C[B: that is the overplay ;-) The previous move was to give room to your marked group, so better follow up on it and play something like A to threaten to cut, or B to make shape.]
;B[ge];W[he];B[jf];W[kf]C[seemed better initially than connecting...

B: yes.];B[ig]CR[je]SQ[mf][of]C[Now I connect anyway, which is probably a mistake. At least it almost gives me an eye.

B: in this case, connecting is important for letting your group out -- see the trail of squares (not actual moves, but as a possible direction).]
;W[je]C[B: good.];B[kg]C[I decide that I can't let black get away with just about everything and need to try to attack his top group.

B: see variation.]
(;W[lc]C[B: attacking that group is the right idea, but M17 is not so good. You invite black to connect, and leaves you with problem N17.]
;B[kc]
(;W[if]LB[mf:A]C[making one eye. Probably aji keshi?

B: there are 2 ways of making a group safer: making eyes, or connecting it to another (safer) group. A move around A will push your group in the direction of you other white stones, which are quite safe. In this situation I think its better to do that than trying yo make eyes. If H16 wasnt a false eye you were right.]
;B[jg];W[md]CR[le][lf]C[B: wrong direction. This pushes black towards his other group and closes of your own group.]
;B[lb]C[B: here you get a chance to repair it a bit, see variation.]

(;W[mc];B[mb]C[Black is trying to live I guess? I decide that this is the time to connect my groups on the outside instead of blocking on the second line.]

(;W[le]C[This is probably the wrong shape though?

B: yes, idea is good, but should be at N14.];B[nb]C[Not I play a bad mistake: I hane on the second line trying to defend the corner...]

(;W[ob]C[B: see variation move.];B[me];W[mf]C[getting out with the middle group as well as attacking the cutting stone.

B: good idea. This was probably a setup by black for P17.];B[oc]
C[B: that one.];W[ne];B[pc]C[During the game I was allright with this result. Still, this is actually terrible for me. I have no territory at all and no shape, while my left group is very weak.

B: recap: in the top you give away some points, but you have a nice wall and influence to the right side in return. Your weak group on the left is only slighly weaker as the black group next to it, so dont worry too much. True, you're a bit behind, but its still an interesting game.]

(;W[qc]C[This might be too small.

B: yes, invite black to take the stone, but get a wall in return. See variation.]
;B[pb]
(;W[gl]LB[cm:A]C[hoping this turn is big

B: getting out with a move around A is better, or doing something on the right side.]
;B[hh]C[black makes shape];W[dq]LB[mi:A][jl:B]C[I try to take the open corner. Black just plays the same move again against it.

B: black made shape, but is he alive? You could ask this by playing around A or B. If he's not too sure, he spends another move, which gives you yet another move to secure the left group, or develop the right side.]
;B[cp];W[dp]C[B: good response.];B[co]
(;W[do]C[B: this is pushing from behind. After the previous move, you want to make a base with the two stones.]
;B[iq]C[again establishing that I don't get any territory anywhere this game unless I kill him which I'm not good enaugh to do.

B: see previous comment.]
(;W[nq]C[Overplay by me. I should approach on the other side and try to build the right side. Of course he would just invade, maybe even pincer me right away, and either kill me or live leaving me with no points, but it's still the right idea, isn't it?

B: yes, you play in the influence of two black stones. See variation.]
;B[lq]
(;W[no]LB[mf:B][gl:A]C[I decide that taking the corner is not good here.

B: if you can run towards group A or B, that ok. But taking the corner is not so bad, see variation.]
;B[or]C[And he doesn't even play Q6. No idea how to react to this.]

(;W[qn]C[probably an overplay.

B: yes, see variaton];B[pn];W[qo]LB[hh:B][no:A]C[probably hane right away was better?

B: slightly, but the error was in the prevous move in my opinion. Maybe better to strengthen your stones A and see if you can attack group B.]
;B[po];W[pm]C[now black has a strong attack on my two stones.

B: yes, he gets a quite an area there as well. if you can keep the right side it would be something, but you also need a move around G3 or C7 to do something with your left group.]
;B[nn]
(;W[mo]LB[nm:A][om:B][ko:2][gq:3][nr:1]C[which I should maybe considered sacrificing

B: yes, in this case you need about 3 moves to attack the two black stones, which black will not allow. So probably better to play at A or B.]
;B[om];W[pl];B[nr];W[qp]LB[ol:A]C[greedy move weakening the 3 stones even more.

B: yes, for the area A is more important.];B[qk]C[black plays consistently.

B: yes, because he connected the group underneath, he can now attack your stones.]

(;W[pk]C[B: try to attack from a distance. See variation.];B[qj]
;W[qh]C[I want something somewhere somehow...];B[pj];W[oj];B[ph]
;W[pg];B[oi];W[ok]C[Probably a bad move, I'm afraid of black building the middle though after cutting that one stone. O9 seems to invite O10 atari.

B: or play at O10 directly in that case.];B[qg]C[and this is actually a good move, it works, doesn't it?

B: my first reaction would be to extend R13. Then you have 4 liberties there, and can look what black does next. His stones are still pretty weak. See variation.]

(;W[qf]C[don't even know what to do here.

B: see previous comment.];B[rg];W[rh]LB[pf:A]C[B: because of the cutting point at A, capturing black from this side is not working.]
;B[rf];W[qe];B[ri];W[oh]C[trying to get some shape in sente.]
;B[pi];W[og]C[Except it's not sente.];B[re]C[probably small, unless black thinks he can kill my whole top (which he probably did think).]
;W[rl]C[defending the cut and trying to take a few points in sente. Except it's not sente at all. Helping the 3 stones on the bottom has been the most urgent move for quite a while now.

B: see earlier variation];B[rd];W[ni]C[sealing black in.];B[lm]
C[My 3 stones are basically dead now and the game is over. I keep playing (and overplaying in kind) until black is about 100 points ahead, then I resign. The rest of the game is only interesting in terms of standard fighting sequences and shapes, which I messed up.
Thank you once more for reviewing this game. I hope you can give me some insight on how I should approach such a game.

B: yes, I hope I've shown you where, in my opinion, you could have played differently. Overall, if your opponent keeps attacking, try to keep calm and strengthen your stones, and counterattack from a distance.]
