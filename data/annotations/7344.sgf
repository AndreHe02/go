[Agi\] Hi I'm AgiNyan of KGS and will be commenting on the game. I'll mark my comments with a tag as I go along.]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[cq];B[dq]C[[Agi\] this is most likely the wrong direction. Following the joseki...]

(;W[dr]C[[Agi\] An odd play by white. Most likely attempting to work with the right side group somehow.]
;B[er];W[cr]
(;B[fq];W[bo]
(;B[cp]C[[Agi\] This simply forces white to make a move he already wants to make.]
;W[bp]C[[Agi\] This position is better than if white played the normal joseki for this position. White has full access to the left side]

(;B[kq]C[[Agi\] Instead black attempts to attack white, which is fine.]
;W[iq]
(;B[jo]TR[jp][kp]C[[Agi\] Black would only play this way if black didn't mind being cut. Here, with the white stones nearby, that may cause trouble.]

(;W[gq];B[gp];W[hp];B[go];W[jq]C[[Agi\] Black absolutely cannot ignore this. Letting white connect the two groups is a diaster.]

(;B[gr];W[kp]C[[Agi\] and white connects];B[ko];W[lp];B[lo]
;W[hr]
(;B[hq]C[[Agi\] This ko isn't important. White has lived, and it's time to move on.]
;W[cf];B[cd]TR[fc][gc][fd][ch][dh]C[[Agi\] this is a really defensive move. The marked areas would have more forward motion than defending that corner]
;W[gq]TR[ci]C[[Agi\] Not a particularly interesting move for white... The marked position would be much more desirable for both players]
;B[aq]C[[Agi\] essentially a pass.];W[gs]C[[Agi\] Apparently white is trying to take away black's eye space in order to cut]
;B[fr];W[ho];B[gn]TR[bo][ho]C[[Agi\] White pushes through, and because black is behind white on both sides, has little choice but to run.]
;W[hn];B[gl];W[cm];B[dm]TR[hm]C[[Agi\] A somewhat peculiar place to attach. The marked pount is a rather important shape point and gets the black group to safety once and for all.]
;W[dn];B[cn];W[co];B[en];W[do];B[eo];W[em];B[dl];W[cl];B[dk]
;W[ck];B[hm]TR[dj]C[[Agi\] Abandoning pushing along the left with just 3 liberties is asking to be abused. Black really needs to extend at least once more]
;W[dj]C[[Agi\] And white happily abuses black's lack of liberties]
;B[ek];W[ej];B[fj]C[[Agi\] reading mistake];W[fk];B[fm];W[fl]
;B[gk];W[el];B[gj];W[fc]
(;B[ec]C[[Agi\] Another extremely defensive move. Instead...]
;W[fd]TR[cf][dj][ej]C[[Agi\] Here, the white stones are starting to look like they're working together]
;B[jc];W[mo];B[mn];W[no];B[nn];W[oo];B[on];W[po];B[qo];W[qn]
;B[qm];W[rn];B[ro];W[im];B[rm]C[[Agi\] One wonders what white was planning giving up those stones]
;W[ln]
(;B[kn];W[lm]C[[Agi\] One has to wonder what is the value of saving those 3 stones as opposed to sacrificing them.]
;B[km];W[ll];B[kl];W[lk];B[kk];W[lj];B[pj];W[ol];B[pl];W[ok]
;B[pk];W[qr]C[[Agi\] White abandons a half-dead group to play along the bottom. Black should be continuing the fight.`]

(;B[rr];W[rs];B[rq];W[pq];B[op];W[np];B[oq]C[[Agi\] This move is clearly gote. Black has better things to do than let white decide where to move next.]
;W[or];B[qp];W[qf]LB[jc:B][pd:D][ll:C][qm:A]C[[Agi\] This move is close to suicide. Group A is clearly alive. C is still not alive yet, and B and D are there]

(;B[pg]C[[Agi\] The shoulder hit is an odd choice.];W[qg];B[qh]
;W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[rj];W[pf];B[og];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[rb]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[sb];B[ra]TR[lj][lk][ok][ll][ol][lm][ln]C[[Agi\] Again, another gote move. Black wants to kill the marked white stones, but keeps getting distracted.]
;W[lh];B[ld];W[ib];B[ic];W[hc];B[hd];W[gb];B[eb];W[jb];B[kb]
;W[kc]

;B[ih];W[jg];B[ig];W[fh]LB[bf:A][df:B]TR[lf][of][mi][nj]C[[Agi\] white still isn't alive in there. Don't give it the chance to. Black also has some endgame moves around A/B

[Agi\]
Black's main problem was in following white around the board and then always giving white sente at critical points throughout the game. 

If black only ignored a few moves by white here or there, and went after white groups that were clearly weak, then the game might have turned out much differently.]
