(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]VW[]C[General comments:

Good game! Played above your rating. More emphasis on edges and corners and  less on centre would help. Also you waste the initiative with small gain gote  moves too often.
 jlhughes 24k*: good luck!]PB[jlhughes]BR[24k*]PW[bigAl]WR[22k]GN[bigAl-jlhughes(B) IGS]

 dslee 10k : Starting observation.];B[qn]C[p14 threatens to connect two  groups (o16 and q14) both of which may have been too small alone. o15 may  have prevented this, and I think would have been bigger than r6.]

;B[ol];W[pm];B[pl];W[qm];B[nm]C[I think it is unwise to  abandon hope of edge territory for dubious central gain. A move such as r4  might have enabled you to push down past row 7, which is worth more than the  centre.]

;W[lm];B[ll];W[km];B[kl];W[jm];B[lj]C[As  a general comment, with much on the edges and corners to play for, this is a  relatively small move. w was not likely to establish a big moyo and nor were  you.]
