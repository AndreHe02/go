C[Hi,
I think that I take a small advantage from the begining to the middle.But I lost at the end.
While reviewing this game, I found some mistake and questions.
Please give me some suggestion with my questions and find more mistake for me.


Hello, i'm Tim, and i'll try to give all the answers you need. I don't know all, but i hope it might help you:-)
Sometimes i give other possible sequences in some situations. 
Don't take them as they are the only possible solution.
Try some more of yourself if you like, try to find out what is the biggest move for you and what is the biggest for your opponent (you might wanna play there!)

I hope it helps you somewhat.
If you still have questions you can always mail me.

Have fun and maybe i'll see you around!

Tim
Cheers!];B[pc];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp]

(;B[hc];W[db];B[cc];W[cb]
(;B[dh]C[Tim: i think it is a bit too open. It is too easy  for white to invade and separate your stones.
(see variation)

It all depends i think on how white wants to play the corner.
Like you played, it is not bad. You get a strong wall and a three point jump is good.
Maybe a four point jump is good too

I felt a little confused with this.
b18, d12, or d11, which is the best choice?
Is there any other better?]

(;B[nb]C[I don't know what craven means:)
This is gentle for white, He can escape but you can hunt him to prevent him making two eyes and gain a lot of territory yourself

I think it's craven.
Should I attack o16 by o14 ?];W[oe];B[he]C[He is weak on both sides, so this isn't really a bad move... But be careful because you too have two weak groups now

I'll show some other situations];W[ke]

Your E8 stones are too weak and he can connect his stones. This is a big loss for black
