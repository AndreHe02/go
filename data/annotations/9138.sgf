C[Reeezy [10k\]: hello gg

Zamoth : Hello, my name is Thomas, and I mostly play blitz game on KGS, and I am 1 kuy. Like you, I all learned by myself. If you want to improve, try making some of those :
- Do Tsumego
- Read reviews played by stronger players, but no more than +2 to +4 kyu
- Watch and pay attention to very good players/pro games, to get yourself inspired by their move flow
- Read books ! If you search, you will find some availiable to download

Let's get back to your game. The game you started was very good. And, in my point of view, what happened is that you got out of track because of this blunder. Let's get to it !]
;B[pp];W[dd]C[ayabe [9k\]: hi];B[qd];W[dp];B[oc];W[qj]C[Z : This is looking for trouble. Avoid playing in between stones when you can play in open spaces.]
;B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[lq]C[Z : 2nd move in between black stones. Why ? There plenty of openspace everywhere. R6 would have made a nicer extention in my opnion. Q4 not under pressure]

(;B[cn]C[Z : I would have probably played var.];W[cp];B[ck]
;W[qm]
(;B[jp]C[Reeezy [10k\]: would pressing the white stones be more beneficial in this position?
Reeezy [10k\]: or a low pincer on M3

Z : With R7, Q4 stone starting to feel the pressure. But it is still alive.
Anyway, pushing this way invites white to go toward the Q4 stone, which will really be starting to get pincered by two strong group. Also this is not yes desiciv in the game, I would have much rather]
;W[ir];B[nq];W[fr];B[gr];W[er];B[hq];W[jq];B[lp];W[hr]
(;B[iq];W[jr]
(;B[mq];W[gs];B[kq];W[lr];B[gq]C[Reeezy [10k\]: i chose to press white flat cause i thought my outside influence works well with the two black stones on the left

Z : I would not analyze this the same way as you did. Here is how I see things :

What did white gain ? Territory on the 2nd line. This is not good at all in early stages of a game
What did black gain ? a strong wall on the 3rd line, which is quite good and makes a lot of influence

There is no real relation yet, between the wall and the two stones on the left.

The stones on the left are the weakest black group

In my point of view, white is behind now. Let's see what he does next]
;W[mr]C[Z : Ridiculous ! White still pushes on the 2nd line and is threating nothing. This move should be banished from his play.

You got sente. At this point, the game is in your hands !!!]
;B[df]C[Z : Good, but I would have rather like to play on the other side because it is more open ... But this is maybe personal taste.]
;W[gc]
(;B[ec]C[Reeezy [10k\]: im not to sure about this black move, after playing it out seemed like i gave white too much thickness

Z : I agree. You could have made things easier. Give him the corner, and build a wall : See var]
;W[ed];B[dc];W[cc];B[cb];W[bc];B[bb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gb];B[eb]
;W[da];B[ab]C[Z : C15 is sente for white and should be considered. A17 is bad, as it leaves C16 as cutting point]

(;W[ac]C[Z : As said, bad !]
(;B[ea];W[cd]C[Z : See how white has to protect the cut ! You got Sente ! White did not get any territory, still very good for you.]
;B[cf]TR[kc][ch]C[Z : If a lonely stone faces a strong wall, just forget it ! Play eselwhere. This is your first really discutable move.

Now What to play ? I would much rather see you playing at the triangles :
C12 makes your shape on the side very strong, and you can get D14 later
L17 weakens the influence of G17 and is still safe];W[hf];B[gf]
TR[lc][fg][qg][ro]C[Z : Touching stones makes them stronger (unless you are 100% sure to kill)

I showed you some easy followup possibilities];W[ge];B[he]C[Z : So many areas to play, why cut living stones ?]
;W[ff];B[gg];W[fe];B[if]TR[lc][fg]C[Z : Other possibilites better than a ladder single killing of a stone]
;W[fg]
(;B[gh]C[Z : when facing a ladder problem, eat as soon as possible. That would have been fine]
;W[fh];B[gi];W[fi]TR[ff][fg][fh]C[Z : See how you managed to make White build this wall ? you are pushing the wrong way and weakening your side]
;B[fj];W[ci]C[Reeezy [10k\]: is there anyway that i could have saved the D14 group after whites move? i couldn't come up with any

Z : see var @ 61]
(;B[di];W[dh];B[ch];W[dj]
(;B[cj]C[Z : Wrong, see var];W[bi];B[ei];W[ej];B[dg];W[eh];B[fk]

(;B[ig]TR[je][mk]C[Reeezy [10k\]: i know the push was terrible move, probably the biggest reason i lost

Z : K15 should be OK. White two stones can be killed with N9]

;W[mk];B[lj];W[kh]C[Z : Very bad for B];B[jj];W[ki];B[kc];W[kk]
;B[mi];W[ko];B[kp];W[hj];B[gj];W[hk];B[jl]TR[el]C[Z : Why spending a move when a group is in danger ? This can not save the 2 lone stones. I would have playe E8 and forget about my lost moyo.

Anyway, see var after, black is completely destroyed.]
(;W[jk];B[il];W[ik];B[fm];W[kl];B[lm];W[km];B[ll];W[lk]C[Z : Another really bad move. Black is forcing white to ... connect ! You should have played there yourself, see var.

But any way, you are playing moves in the center, but your moyo is already destroyed. You should thinks of playing moves elsewhere, because there are not so many points in the center.

This 2 last move should have been played as end game moves]
;B[ln];W[kn];B[io]TR[hm][lo]C[Z : This ending shape is not good at all. This last move is not needed, and does not make any points. The two triangles show weak spots. in this particular place.]
;W[md]C[Z : This stones might be worth at least 5 points. Black so behind now !]
;B[le]C[Z : This move is your last blunder move. the game is definitively lost afterwards]
;W[me];B[ke];W[kg];B[lf]C[Reeezy [10k\]: was this move unncessarry? would white not have eye space either way?
Reeezy [10k\]: i was too focused on killing the eye shape that i let my group get cut off

Z : Your blac stones are weak, and you are pushing your weak stones in a big and strong white group. Before attacking, you must always make sure your stones are alive (unless you kill before you die)

You should have played N17 2 moves ago !

You are so jalous of white without any reasons]

Z : Game ended

What was the worse in your game ?
Square : This ladder should never have started
Triangle : The loss of those two stones cut 2 weak groups slowing your progression down so much
Square + Triangle = Circles > White found a way to come into the center

Remeber some of those senteces :
- Play away from strengh (D2 was to slow. N2 was the same)
- When in a diffucult position, try turning around stones (see what I showed instead of loosing the 2 stones at the triangles)
- When Facing a ladder, eat as soon as possible, don't extend unless you have a well settled strategy (H13 instead of G12)
- In anyway, let the oppenent live, instead of pushing away, instead of darkening your own land by a dark sky (Pushing G12 G11, allowed white to play F12 F11 weakening your stones on the side)
- When the opponent makes a wall (G19, G15) an extent of your position toward the wall is good, but not too far, your stone must be safe.

Those are the biggest strategy mistakes. Of course you made some reading mistakes, but those are more easy to understand, as they are instant.

Hope you progress in your overall strategy])
